undoubtedly
it
must

agree
that
such

to

the
view
that
almost
incontrovertibly

distinct

at

of

two
distinct

all

come
to
justify
the
supposition
maintain
by
historical
record
of
the
existence
of
two
grand
epoch
of

the

the

the

this

in

be
hardly
appreciable
in
the
general
appearance
of
these

again
be
of
opinion
that
a
careful
study
of
many
example
of
both
kind
of

reveals
the
fact
that
the
low

sub
stratum
ascribed
to
the
phoenician
be
of
quite
a
distinct
form
and
appearance
these
inferior

certainly
more
rugosas

less
perfectly

even

as

as
to
this

feature
both
seem
to
be
singularly
free

distinguishable
from

of
examine
the

very
carefully

minutely
to

that
when
determine
and
brought
to

don

could
direct
what

be
do
with
the
great
advantage
to
his
majesty
the
king
in
virtue
of
our
instruction
we
left
the
town
of
aracena
for
the
district
of
zalamea
at
the
end
of
july
and
proceed
to
and
stop
at
a
place
call
rio
tin
to
now
the
town
of
nerva
about
a
quarter
of
a
league
from
the
various
work
of
the
ancient
the
day
follow
we
go
to
the
cave
call
salitre
to
day
call
tabacco
and
enter
and
examine
it
this
cave
extends
back
from
its
entrance
some
sixty
pace
have
a
width
of
more
than
eighty
pace
its
height
be
that
of
a
church
and
it
have
an
arch
roof
or
ceiling
from
it
extend
many
passage
some
of
them
lead
toward
the
high
part
of
the
hill
above
several
shaft
too
be
found
and
descend
one
to
ascertain
its
object
i
found
z
vein
of
mineral
half
hidden
by
the
earth
which
hid
evidently
be
intentionally
thrown
upon
it
to
conceal
it
remove
the
earth
with
ny
own
hand
i
fully
expose
the
lode
vena
and
take
from
it
about
an
arroba
twenty
five
pound
weight
of
mineral
i
notice
the
evidence
of
work
do
on
this
same
vein
and
from
the
condition
and
appearance
of
thing
conclude
that
the
work
here
be
of
very
great
antiquity
return
from
the
shaft
we
search
the
whole
of
the
cave
and
found
that
the
ancient
have
be
extract
four
or
five
different
kind
of
metal
all
of
which
be
take
from
the
one
mother
vein
or
lode
find
however
that
it
be
impossible
to
discover
the
lode
on
account
of
the
immense
mass
of
earth
rock
and
rubbish
to
be
remove
i
determine
to
make
search
elsewhere
on
the
hill
above
although
the
surface
be
very
rocky
and
precipitous
and
cover
with
a
dense
scrub
or
brushwood
on
the
day
of
san
lorenzo
th
of
august
ten
day
after
our
arrival
at
the
place
i
go
with
a
labourer
with
pick
and
shovel
to
a
site
where
on
make
a
search
i
discover
sign
of
mineral
and
where
with
slight
effort
i
found
the
lode
i
get
out
and
take
away
some
twenty
five
pound
of
it
as
a
sample
and
sent
it
on
to
don
francisco
de
mendoza
ascertain
then
that
the
metal
found
in
the
cave
and
in
the
shaft
and
that
which
i
have
discover
high
up
the
slope
of
the
hill
be
one
and
the
same
thing
and
also
that
the
ancient
have
know
of
it
and
have
work
there
i
felt
that
i
could
confidently
assure
don
francisco
of
the
great
importance
of
this
re
discovery
for
him
to
take
such
step
as
under
the
circumstance
might
be
found
to
be
most
advantageous
to
benefit
by
it
in
the
same
way
we
determine
by
continuous
search
the
existence
of
the
site
of
many
large
work
and
building
of
furnace
and
of
deposit
of
escoriae
all
the
result
of
labour
of
very
great
antiquity
of
the
escoriae
we
found
cover
with
dense
brushwood
such
enormous
quantity
that
they
actually
form
small
hill
which
cover
two
square
league
of
ground
continue
we
found
another
cave
call
cueva
del
lago
full
of
water
from
which
a
stream
escape
name
by
the
people
of
the
neighbourhood
rio
tinto
the
stream
be
name
so
because
of
its
constantly
colour
appearance
evidently
spring
from
a
body
of
mineral
of
iron
and
copper
i
ascertain
that
throughout
its
course
it
be
very
strongly
colour
especially
in
the
summer
that
it
form
strongly
tint
deposit
of
a
material
on
its
bank
which
during
the
month
of
august
and
september
the
people
living
near
to
the
river
be
oblige
to
recover
and
with
it
pay
a
certain
tribute
to
the
archbishop
of
sevilla
who
claimed
to
be
the
only
person
entitle
to
this
usufruct
person
deprive
him
of
any
of
it
be
liable
to
punishment
this
material
so
deposit
refer
to
be
still
collect
in
the
summer
and
sell
to
painter
or
eolourmen

those
who
care
to
take
the

the
people
do
not

to

cause
of
this
permanent

several
curious
and

property
if
any

very
generally

of
this

another
and
very
distinctive
peculiarity

property
that
if
iron

in
a

the

prove
no

in
the

nor
any
loose

inasmuch
as
the

have
the
peculiar
power
of
binding
everything
in
it
into
a
hard
solid
mass
in
search
for
the
lode
of

we
found
two
large
hill
on
both
of
which
be
evident
sign
of
other
method
of

of

at
the
extraction
of

for

others
again
not
for
mineral
but
make
for
the
drainage
of
the
work
as
they
progress
i
found
more
than
fifty
of
such
shaft
in
and
about
this
locality
evidently
that
now
know
as
san

one

a

fifteen

and
close
to
it
about
eight
pace
away
start
another

now
know
as
the
tintillo
similar
in
character
to
the
other
stream
the
rio

many
other
thing
in
this
locality
be
left
unascertained
or
undetermined
owe
to
the
dense
growth
of
brushwood
and
the
broken
and
very
rough
state
of
the
country
search
be
then
make
to
find
the
site
of
the
old
refining
work
or
furnace
to
ascertain
if
possible
if
the
ancient
work
in
silver
or
other
metal
but
i
could
not
find
any
trace
of
them
again
owe
to
the
density
of
the
monte
scrub
but
we
found
on
the
top
of
the
high
hill
ruin
and
indication
of
old
edifice
and
on
far
search
and
excavation
discover
a
small
quantity
of
lead
at
a
depth
of
one
estado
eleven
foot
from
which
i
deduce
that
the
ancient
possess
and
work
in
lead
ore
and
that
their
object
in
view
in
treat
such
ore
be
to
obtain
silver
here
reference
be
undoubtedly
make
to
the

be
see
by
the

as
to
the

by
him
of
the

they
go
far
to
prove
the
work
of
the

that
the

on

as
to

that

the

of

the

then
weigh
upon

those
also
create
by
the

great

to
lament
equally
the

spent
in

neither

the

have
obtain
from
the

in
question
their
immense
fortune
in
so
short
a

four

during
almost
the
whole

at
the

their
leave
it
have
not

that
entirely

of

be
skilful
in
such
labour
construct
an
aqueduct
on
the
southern
side
at
a
much
low
level
than
that
of
the
site

for

by
the
ancient

the
north
side
by
it
they
work
towards
the
centre
of
the

with
the
objectof
be
able
to
work
at
low
level
in
procure
a
natural
drainage
without
have
to
have
recourse
to
any
artificial
mean
and
although
to
day
we
find
large
deposit
of
vitriolized
water
in
the
interior
of
this
mountain
i
believe
that
as
all
might
be
make
to
drain
out
without
the
use
of
artificial
mean
it
can
be
easily
and
quickly
do
and
in
that
manner
at
small
cost
we
can
discover
all
the
old
grand
and
important
interior
working
and
rich
it
be
evident
that
the
obstruction
to
the
free
exit
of
the
water
from
the
interior
of
the
mine
by
that
drain
or
aqueduct
for
that
be
its
present
condition
be
a
stone
of
very
large
proportion
which
in
my
opinion
have
be
maliciously
place
at
the
mouth
of
the
eleventh
shaft
or
ventilator
of
the
aqueduct
in
consequence
of
which
the
exit
from
the
interior
part
be
interrupt
and
there
be
no
doubt
but
that
the
saracen
who
be
the
last
to
work
in
these
niines
find
themselves
hard
press
and
oblige
to
retire
from
this
place
adopt
this
mean
of
prevent
the
spaniard
from
any
easy
adoption
of
the
benefit
of
their
own
and
earlier
labour
and
exploration
the
tradition
be
commonly
current
in
this
neighbourhood
that
in
the
various
hollow
and
cave
of
this
hill
in
its
subterranean
work
exist
hidden
treasure
in
great
quantity
either
in
money
or
in
metal
but
what
foundation
or
probability
exists
for
such
i
cannot
well
understand
unless
it
be
that
because
of
the
sudden
exodus
of
the
saracen
after
a
long
and
prosperous
occupation
of
the
place
they
must
have
be
compel
to
bury
and
leave
behind
hidden
a
certain
quantity
of
treasure
note
in
the
write
history
extant
of
the
occupation
for
upwards
of
seven
century
of

by
the

little
or
no

of
this

about
sixteen

furnishes
abundant
proof
of
their

in
this
district
for
well
explanation
as
to
the
aqueduct

drain
refer
to
it
will
be
proper
for
me
to
state
your
excellency
that
it
be
so
large
as
to
permit
the
easy
entrance
of
a
person
to
work
in
it
and
that
from
its
aperture
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
to
its
conclusion
there
be
twenty
two

serve
for
light
and
ventilation
at
a
regular
distance
from
each
other
of
twelve

thus
the
total
length
of
this
gallery
be
yard
in
the
mouth
of
the
eleventh
ventilate
shaft
there
be
place
the
very
large
stone
already
refer
to
which
detains
and
arrest
the
free
exit
and
drainage
of
the
water
from
the
interior
and
from
the
lode
by
it
be
form
a
large
lake
of
highly
vitriolized
water
very
clean
and
translucent
so
much
so
that
the
bottom
can
easily
be
distinguish
as
well
as
the
obstruct
stone
in
its
place
i
have
the
curiosity
to
measure
the
depth
of
the
water
and
ascertain
it
to
be
about
twelve
estados
jabout

some
thirty

these

most
abundant
in
whether
of
gold

silver
it
be
not
very
easy
to
ascertain
but
all
indication
lead
it
to
be
infer
that
gold
be
the
principal
item
the
opinion
of
the
expert
but
apart
from
indication
so
patent
sic
which
i
have
derive
and
deduce
from
document
of
undoubtedly
high
authority

the
notice

by
a
most
eminent

this

with
two

from

eighty

previously
in

some

after
many
and
various

discover
the
method
of
separate
the

in
the

that

he

his

in

in

immense
treasure
have
found

little
silver
but
a

as
his

partly
because

because
there
also
exist
at
the

time
the

the
ultimate
result
and
end
be
that
this

its
abundant

remain
forgotten
the

be
not
those
as

as

be
those
which
have
already
suffer
a

they

in
antimony
arsenic
sulphur

for
which
reason
in
order
to
abstract
the
richer

contain
in
them
it
will
be
necessary
to
prosecute
the
method
of
extraction
no
doubt
ascertainable
in
the
archive
of
the
year
allude
to
of
and
there
be
many
men
of
great
skill
able
to
extract
and
separate
pure
metal
from
impure
in
the
different
kingdom
of
the
north
probably
allude
to
germany
or
sweden
i
know
from
my
own
personal
knowledge
that
there
be
many
person
well
skilled
in
this
art
of
extraction
and
separation
elsewhere
and
do
not
doubt
but
that
they
will
also
be
met
with
in
spain
i
be
unable
to
specify
definitely
and
clearly
what
be
or
will
be
the
pure
metal
to
be
obtain
from
these
mine
but
from
all
that
i
have
refer
to
the
existence
of
the
deposit
of
vitriolized
water
in
the
interior
the
copious
quantity
of
vermellon
and
caparrosa
natural
and
fine
that
be
also
so
much
in
evidence
and
of
which
i
send
sample
to
your
excellency
all
in
my
judgment
undoubtedly
indicate
the
abundance
of
and
the
superior
value
of
the
metal
to
be
found
there
at
what
period
of
antiquity
and
history
or
under
what
particular
government
the
first
attempt
be
make
to
extract
and
assay
these
mineral
i
be
quite
unable
to
ascertain
and
certify
but
undoubtedly
operation
have
more
or
less
continuously
be
carry
on
here
for
very
many
century
for
the
present
i
will
simply
take
the
evidence
of
piece
of
money
and
medallion
casually
found
by
pastores
herdsman
and
others
in

about
the

of
that
ancient

to
those
still

near
the

of
the

on
the

of
the

also

from
their

as
the
character
impressed
upon
it

in

i
cannot
pretend
to
determine
to
what

it

it
be
not
at

necessary
in

exactly
how
when

by
whom
these
evidently
ancient
work
be
commenced

abandon

maintain
that
the
art
of
extract

the
drainage
of

oblige
no

due

questionable
conduct
on

very
harshly

the

elsewhere
no
doubt
at
a
very
considerable
disadvantage

only
about

sometimes
even

have
never

as
now
despite
the
manifold
allusion
extant
to
its
glorious
state
of
might
and
wealth
in
the
middle
age
on
what
practical

intimate
knowledge
of
the

its
inhabitant
those
opinion
be
base
and
formulate
and
historian
have
pronounce
it
be
difficult
now
to
estimate
but
it
be
very
certain
that
neither
the
state
archive
of
the
country
nor
of
its
city
nor
the
general
appearance
and
condition
of
the
inner
life
of
the
people
and
of
the
city
and
town
seem
to
assist
one
in
the
belief
that
it
ever
be
so
spain
have
be
for
upwards
of
twenty
century
simply
an
agricultural
country
until
but
recently
without
any
export
or
foreign
trade
of
importance
unless
wine
be
except
its
inhabitant
have
grown
sufficient
food
and
have
not
be
much
concerned
in
opening
out
new
field
of
enterprise
and
prosperity
or
of
occupy
themselves
much
in
business
the
general
appearance
of
its
old
city
and
town
lead
one
to
infer
that
for
many
century
the
people
have
be
more
or
less
content
and
that
even
if
they
have
not
progress
they
have
not
suffer
the
terrible
relapse
from
the
high
state
of
national
prosperity
and
civilization
even
so
authoritatively
state
to
have
be
the
condition
of
spain
and
its
people
in
the
middle
age
the
evidence
available
carefully
and
impartially
examine
go
rather
to
establish
the
contrary
there
seem
to
be
a
general
strike
indifference
to
accuracy
in
english
literature
and
book
anent
spain
in
a
recently
publish
edition
of
the
encyclopedia
brittanica
in
the
article

odd

in
which
the

which
be
probably
fully
account
for
by
the
backward
state
of
cultivation
generally
and
in
particular
by
the
small
expenditure
in
