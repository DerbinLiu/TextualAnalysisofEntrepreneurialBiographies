perhaps
he
already
at

have
an
unconscious

his

with

be

a
strong

he
himself

may
have

wish

have
a
man
at

early
a

thus
in

when
the

schmitt

the

however
schmitt
begin
to

this
soon
become
the

however
the

also
have
to

in

so
that
the

be
a
sharp

schmitt
felt
very
strongly
that

it
would
appear
however
that

do
not
take
this
advice
with
the
result
that
the

end
up

one
cannot
deny
that
the

lead
to

to

that

of

out
that

to
the

not
unknown
in
america

it
be
important
to
note
that
there
have
be
some
genuine
national
and
inter
national
resistance
against

self

salutary

the
possibility
of

his

take

that

very
long

that
one
under
no
circumstance
should
allow
the
reich

for

surance
to
mix
in
it
be
decide
to
ask
herr
dr
schmitt

from
the

as
well
as
dr
herzfelder
of
the
hermes

ag
to
discus
the
matter
with
us
furthermore
allianz
have
considerable
infuence
with
the
reich
supervisory
agency
thus
make
its
role
even
more
advantageous
indeed
the
raa
have
to
approve
the
contract
between
allianz
and
favag
it
do
so
on
august
and
thus
immediately
alienate
a
substantial
and
the
most
intact
and
lucrative
portion
of
favag
s
business
without
even
summon
a
meeting
of
its
shareholder
furthermore
the
raa
thereby
issue
an
effective
ban
on
payment
to
other
creditor
until
the
price
allianz
would
pay
could
be
de
cided
and
until
the
asset
and
liability
of
the
rump
favag
could
be
determine
it
fell
within
the
power
of
the
raa
to
give
primary
protection
to
the
policyholder
but
these
action
also
involve
a
bypassing
of
the
interest
of
shareholder
and
other
creditor
that
the
raa
could
only
justify
with
the
argument
that
the
value
of
allianz
s
acquisition
would
diminish
if
insurance
business
turn
elsewhere
and
that
this
would
not
be
in
the
interest
of
anyone
although
allianz
certainly
stood
to
gain
substantially
and
could
determine
what
it
would
and
would
not
take
over
it
be

to
pay
some

for

feel

also
on
the

re

there
be
also
a

that

have
paid
too
little
for

receive
the
view
of

of
course
be
that
it
have
prevent
a
catastrophe
for
the
german
insurance
industry
and
for
the
german
economy
in
general
both
argument
be
probably
correct
and
the
debate
be
highly
relevant
to
the
second
and
far
less
soluble
aspect
of
the
favag

pay
off
as
much
as

these
amount
to
million
rm
to
domestic
creditor
and
million
rm
to
foreign
creditor
the
obvious
solution
be
to
form
a
standstill
syndicate
of
the
creditor
while
the
banking
committee
of
the
favag
supervisory
board
provide
some
guarantee
and
time
be
take
to
determine
favag
s
actual
status
and
what
allianz
be
willing
to
pay
favag
for
its
acquisi
tions
some
of
favag
s
foreign
creditor
prove
unwilling
to
agree
and
thought
that
the

the

make

to
prevent
a
cessation
of

by
favag
the
german
economy
cannot
bear

they
all
agree

that

they

also
warn

and
infation
the
reason
in
insurance
as
well
as
in

felds

be
that

a
strong
tendency
to
break

to
gain
some
immediate
advantage
thus
break
up
the
cartel
the
condition
under
which
the
weimar

attain

of

as

put
it
it
be
one
of
the
task
of
the

association
through
a
detailed
presentation
of

to
view
the
maintenance
of
the
health
of
the
insurance
industry
as
an
important
part
of
its
task
i
be
not
argue
that
the
reich
as
sociation
should
set
itself
the
task
of
intervene
in
individual
branch
the
individual
task
should
rather
be
reserve
to
the
individual
branch
association
as
before
but
it
be
necessary
to
create
the
mentality
and
mood
which
be
necessary
in
the
branch
association
so
that
they
can
overcome
diffculties
and
constraint
which
show
up
at
the

level
thus
schmitt
be
a
strong
opponent
of

state

to
work
hand

he

this
be
indeed
a
vast
increase
of
the
over
sight
power
and
capacity
of
the
raa
but
the
reich

successfully
fought
back
consumer
demand
for
place
transport
and
reinsurance
under
the
raa
the
association
argue
that
these
branch
be
not
suitable
for
such
control
and
use
its
chief
supporter
in
the

to
drive
through
a

under
which

could

extend
to
uncovered

if
the
reich

the

agree
to
do
so
both
be
expect
to
be
friendlier
to

than
the

in

therefore
the
new
legislation
be
a
political
success
for
the
insurance
industry
and
be
base
on
the
type
of

government

advocate
by

indeed
the

face

chal

and

thus
with
the
strong

successfully
propose

after
those
of

so
that
alongside
the

would
be
give

bury
along
with
all
the
other
socialization
plan
at
this
time
the
idea
of
so
cialization
actually
go
back
to
the
prewar
period
when
it
be
advocate
by
the
professorial
socialist
adolph
wagner
and
much

have
no
clear
idea

effectively
end
the
socialization
debate
for
the
rest
of
the
weimar

its
primary
effect
be
to

encourage
the
development
of
the

association
the

like

a
monopoly
would
necessarily
be
antitheti

these

whereas
socialization
would
turn
all
their
agent
into
civil
servant
and
reduce
their
income
after
the

the

rather
as

a

result
of

conficts
this
be
indeed
the
goal
of
hilgard
as
well
who
fear
that
a
court

would
develop
out
of
the
charge

the

do
not

demonstrate
by

of

of

while

warn
that

even
more
obstreperous
signifcantly
the
raa

private

in
their
continued
protest
that
charter

be
unfairly
lay
claim
to
a
monopoly
on

once
again
a
decision
be
make
to
try
to
avoid
an
open
battle
and
to
rein
in
both
side
but
this
be
no
easy
matter
in
the
depressed
and
highly
competitive
condition
of
the
early
s
kurt
schmitt
who
become
chairman
and
thus
lead
spokesman
of
the
reich
association
for
private
insurance
at
the
end
of
never
tire
of
point
out
that
the
insurance
business
be
weather
the
economic
crisis
rather
well
com
par
to
other
business
sector
allianz
be
do
particularly
well
under
the
circumstance
he
attribute
this
success
to
the
long
range
character
of
insur
ance
policy
the
care
with
which
the
industry
invest
its
money
and
the
need
for
every
kind
of
insurance
even
in
bad
time
because
of
the
need
to
back
up
its
policy
with
proper
coverage
the
insurance
industry
be
not
dependent
on
short
term
foreign
money
but
be
rather
a
granter
of
credit
itself
and
thus
do
not
suffer
from
the
liquidity
problem
face
other
economic
sector
thus
whereas
many
sector
have
as
much
as
a
reduction
of
business
in
the
insurance
sector
drop
only
between
and
schmitt
be
certainly
concerned
about
premature
termination
of
policy
which
refected
the
grow
impoverishment
of
many
german
and
he
felt
that
it
be
worth
the
extra
ad
ministrative
cost
to
maintain
exist
policy
and
bring
in
new
business
in
his
frequent
public
statement
to
the
press
and
in
radio
address
schmitt
sought
to
present
an
upbeat
message
and
to
promote
confdence
in
germany
s
business
leadership
he
be
very
critical
of
the
drag
on
of
trial
in
connection
with
various
business
scandal
as
be
occur
in
the
favag
and
other
case
and

of

a

take
in
the

report
of

and
it
refected
the
attitude
express
at
meeting
of
the
allianz
director
thus
on
october
at
the
last
such
meeting
held
before
the
national
socialist
come
to

note
be
take
of
a
general
reduction
of
pessimism
and
improvement
of
business
condition
even
as
continued
economic
uncertainty
require
an
ongoing
policy
of
caution
these
public
pronouncement
be
free
of
partisan
political
commentary
and
criticism
despite
the
profound
political
unrest
and
political
violence
of
these
year
indeed
such
restraint
characterize
allianz
as
well
as
the
reich
associa
tion
distinguish
it
from
the
more
vociferous
criticism
to
be
found
in
public
commentary
put
out
by
great
industrial
frms
and
by
the
reich
association
of
german

insofar
as
allianz
and
its
leader
as
well
as
the

that
have
played
a
major
role
in
bring
on
the
banking
crisis
the
measure
effectively
take
germany
off
the
gold
standard
however
in
contrast
to
the
british
departure
from
gold
in
september
the
german
sought
to
maintain
the
value
of
the
reichsmark
by
persist
in
defationary
policy
at
home
nevertheless
the
new
exchange
con
trol
regime
be
a
severe
departure
from
liberal
economic
trade
policy
and
it
be
one
that
have
dangerous
implication
for
the
insurance
industry
quite
aside
from
the
fact
that
there
be
a
number
of
foreign
insurer
operating
in
germany
that
could
be
affected
by
the

the

on
the

it

for
variety
of

the
british

dutch
indie
china
siam

ceylon
on
the

most
notably
bore

company
in
stockholm
and
the
south
african
liberal

ltd
in
almost
all
case
allianz
require
the
approval
of
the
raa
for
such
engagement
because
they
involve
a
change
in
the
business
plan
but
the
introduction
of
exchange
control
meant
that
they
also
need
permission
to
secure
the
foreign
exchange
necessary
to
carry

these
operation
finally
as

earlier
there
be
nu
merous
policy

the

this

their

so
that

one
will

out
with

that
the

if

establish

the

of

the

great
importance
to
its
assign

to
work
out
the

of
his
defationary
program
of
reduce
not
only
wage
and
salary
but
also
price
and
interest
rate
it
prove
less
signifcant
than
bring
have
hop
although
certainly
worried
about
the
economic
situation
schmitt
s
basic
stance
be
that
ultimately
the
economy
have
to
cure
itself
and
to
avoid
exces
sive
state
intervention
naturally
he
place
great
emphasis
on
defcit
reduction
at
all
level
of
government
and
on
maintain
the
stability
of
the
currency
al
though
he
could
not
deny
the
need
for
emergency
measure
he
be
especially
concerned
about
the
inclination
to
reduce
interest
rate
by
decree
see
in
such
measure
a
loss
of
nerve
that
would
create
great
uncertainty
and
insecurity
in
the
population
this
stance
be
hardly
surprising
for
an
insurance
business
exec
utive
since
low
interest
rate
would
reduce
both
the
return
on
insurance
asset
and
on
the
mortgage
that
constitute
an
important
component
of
insurance
company
reserve
argue
that
premium
inevitably
adjust
to
price
level
in
any
case
schmitt
insist
the
situation
would
even
be
bad
if
low
premium
be
mandate
in
short
he
be
insistent
that
one
could
not
relieve
debtor
without
create
insecurity
among
creditor
and
that
the
result
would
be
artif
cial
regulation
try
to
square
the
circle
indeed
schmitt
in
alliance
with
the
powerful
lignite
industrialist
paul
silverberg
prefer
to
see
the
reichsbank
low
its
discount
rate
and
to
have
a
measure
of
subsidization
of
the
heavily
in
debted
agricultural
sector
and
expansion
of
credit
to
spark
the
economy
a
policy
oppose
by
the
reichsbank
and
by
more
conservative
member
of
the
advisory
council
the
end
result
of
all
these
deliberation
be
the
fourth
emergency
de
cree
issue
at
the
begin
of
december
which
sought
to
low
price

the

however
also
push

the

goal
be
to
complete
the
process
of

and
prepare
the
way
for
an

schmitt

this
possible
but
when
he

the
emphasis

the

schmitt

his

could
not

long
live
as
it
possess
too
narrow
a

among

no

communist
nazi

a

thus
schmitt
have
turn
down
bring
because
one
could
not

with
the
political
party
and
now
he
turn

could
not

without

the

denominator
aside
from
the
fact
that
he
be
loathe
to

a

that

these
be
perfectly
rational
perception
for
a
man
with
no

schmitt
s
preference
for
play
the
economic
policy
expert
to
the
unstable
authoritarian
regime
ruling
germany
be
understandable
nevertheless
schmitt
be
well
aware
of
the
great
hardship
create
by
the
depression
and
the
defationary
policy
he
advocate
he
fret
over
the
high
unemployment
and
worried
about
political
violence
especially
from
the
left
there
be
no
evidence
that
he
have
any
formal
political
affliation
during
the
fnal
year
of
the

and
the
increasingly
authori
tarian
character
of
the
bring
and
von
papen
regime
and
their
dependence
on
emergency
decree
obviate
the
need
for
party
affliation
in
his
contact
with
the
government
like
most
business
leader
he
urge
contact
with
all
the
po
litical

and
seem
to
have
have
decent
relation

social

as
well
indeed
insofar
as
direct
participation

that

be
the

barrier

that
it

not

the

question
and
cursory
answer

to

account
he

away
with
the
feel
that
hitler
s
come
to
power
be
not
in
germany

interest
but
also
that
it
be
important
not
to
remain
on
the
sideline
in
the
near
future
but
to
seek
contact
with
the
lead
men
of

in
this
way
to
gain

in
hot
pursuit
in

follow
up
the
meeting
with
an
invitation
to

in
his
home
in
the
kaiserstra

where
they
be
join
by
his
later
adjutant
paul
kner
what
most
interested
ging
of
course
be
a
large
contribution
to
the
party
but
he
also
press
schmitt
to
join
the
party
and
promise
to
arrange
the
matter
schmitt
demur
and
the
mat
ter
be
left
hang
but
hilgard
knew
that
schmitt
who
have
a
tendency
to
seek
out
the
positive
in
everyone
found
ging
quite
charm
especially
in
com
parison
with
hitler
there
be
obviously
substantial
difference
between
hilgard
s
account
writ
ten
in
the
s
after
schmitt
be
dead
and
schmitt
s
statement
at
his
interrogation
whereas
both
agree
that
the
meeting
with
ging
take
place
in
and
that
egger
be
the
contact
man
schmitt
deny
that
he
have
ever
met
hitler
before
the
latter
take
power
hilgard
s
memoir
thus
contradict
schmitt
s
testimony
by
claim
that
there
have
be
such
a
meeting
with
hitler
and
at
least
one
other
meeting
with
ging
then
again
however
hilgard
himself
have
told
a
somewhat
different
story
when
he
be
interrogate
on
july
i
e
at
the
same
time
as
schmitt
in
that
interrogation
he
never
mention
a
meeting
with
hitler
and
spoke
of
only
one
meeting
with
ging
in
the
summer
not
the
ibid
p
fall
of
he
claimed
there
that
during
one
of
the
allianz
press
conference
he
have
ask
emil
helfferich
brother
of
the
late
karl
helfferich
a
german
na
tional
people
s
party
deputy
and
a
businessman
from
hamburg
if
the
nsdap
have
any
exceptional
personality
to
which
helfferich
reply
by
name
ging
as
the
ablest
representative
of
the
party
despite
his
terrible
character
hilgard
then
suggest
to
schmitt
that
they
make
contact
with
ging
which
they
do
through
egger
accord
to
this
account
ging
come
two
hour
late
to
the
restaurant
hiller
ask
for
support
against
the
communist
indicate
an
in
tention
to
drive
the
jew
from
public
life
but
do
not
make
any
specifc
request
for
propaganda
and
fnancial
support
while
admit
that
both
he
and
schmitt
be
impressed
with
ging
as
a
come
man
hilgard
nevertheless
claimed
to
have
never
met
with
him
again
before
the
seizure
of
power
yet
we
have
see
that
hilgard
s
own
memoir
belie
this
statement
it
be
of
course
in
no
way
surprising
that
schmitt
and
hilgard
be
anxious
to
hide
or
forget
contact
with
hitler
before
and
more
generally
to
date
their
contact
with
ging
and
the
nazi
to
as
near
the
end
of
the
weimar
republic
as
possible
the
trouble
with
both
account
however
be
that
they
be
refute
by
the
interrogation
of
the
man
who
do
indeed
bring
them
together
with
ging
namely
walter
egger
who
on
august
give
a
precise
and
detailed
ac
count
of
what
happen
that
in
no
way
fattered
himself
or
anyone
else
egger
have
met

for
the
frst
time

try

the
fush
of
their
great
victory

of
the
dozen
or
so
person
present
at
the
dinner
in
question
and
egger
spoke
with
him
privately
for
about
an
hour
primarily
about
hitler
s
idea
of
set
up
an
economic
senate
of
lead
expert
to
advise
him
fritz
thyssen
one
of
the
few
industrialist
enthusiast
for
hitler
have
agree
to
serve
while
it
be
expect
that
those
who
serve
would
support
the
goal
of
the
party
membership
be
not
require
egger
suggest
that
it
would
be
im
portant
to
have
an
insurance
industry
leader
on
such
a
body
and
recommend
that
he
meet
schmitt
egger
who
have
a
very
favorable
impression
of
ging
and
who
be
convince
that
sooner
or
later
the
nazi
be
certain
to
come
to
power
spoke
to
schmitt
on
the
next
day
and
point
out
that
it
would
be
clever
tactic
on
our
part
to
cultivate
the
acquaintanceship
of
lead
nazi
per
sonalities
at
an
earlier
rather
than
at
a
later
date
so
as
to
win
thereby
a
voice
in
the
shape
of
the
economic
program
of
the
party
schmitt
agree
with
this
analysis
and
what
then
follow
be
a
meeting
at
restaurant
hiller
in
the
last
day
of
october
or
the
frst
day
of
november
between
egger
schmitt
and
ging
interrogation
of
eduard
hilgard
july
na

omgus

the
account
and
quotation
that
follow
be
base
on
this
interrogation
of
the
just
retire
walter
egger
on
august
na
rg
omgus
finad
during
the
two
hour
luncheon
ging
apparently
so
impressed
and
over
whelm
the
two
men
that
he
won
us
over
completely
to
the
political
program
of
the
nazi
party
ging
spoke
of
the
jew
and
express
the
view
that
they
ought
to
be
permit
to
live
peace
fully
in
germany
but
that
the
right
to
vote
should
be
withdrawn
from
them
and
that
they
should
not
be
permit
to
hold
public
offce
or
to
participate
in
the
profession
or
to
hold
position
which
would
place
them
in
authority
over
german
egger
admit
that
dr
schmitt
and
myself
share
these
view
at
the
time
and
hence
ging
s
statement
struck
us
both
as
very
reasonable
furthermore
this
be
by
no
mean
the
only
meeting
egger
state
that
schmitt
ging
and
egger
held
some
eight
to
ten
meeting
at
two

three

interval
at

between
october
and

egger
remember
two
other
person
be
present
at
individual
meeting
as
well
one
be
the
later
reichsstatthalter
of
bavaria
and
schmitt
s
former
regimental
commander
franz
xaver
ritter
von
epp
the
other
be
eduard
hilgard
who
be
at
one
of
the
luncheon
in
early
schmitt
apparently
express
great
admiration
for
ging
thus
after

not
hold
my

i
could
readily
conceive
that
i
would
gladly
play
a
role
in
this

for
the

reason
of
his
role
as
a

egger
admit
that
we
found
it
quite
amuse

schmitt
also
seem
willing
to

rather
ex
pensive
lifestyle
when

that

schmitt
told
egger
that
ging
have
good
political
idea
and
we
must
help
him
i
will
get
the

egger
consider

be
certain
the

be
sent
there
be
many
reason
to
give
more
credence
to
egger
s
account
than
to
either
schmitt
s
or
hilgard
s
first
of
all
egger
s
explanation
of
how
he
come

consistent
with
what

about

and
then

in

stayed
on
until
may
egger
become
a

of

then

in

his
testimony
it
be
important
to
note
be
give
after
his
retirement
therefore
it
be
obvious
that
egger
intro
duced
schmitt
and
hilgard
to
ging
before
he
left
for
frankfurt
in
the
spring
of
all
this
do
not
mean
that
schmitt
and
hilgard
do
not
meet
with
ging
after
april
and
in
indeed
egger
specifcally
state
that
the
meeting
continued
and
that
his
role
as
liaison
be
take
over
by
director
walter
boehm
later
director
of
the
allianz
branch
in
dresden
encompass
saxony
and
sile

thus
schmitt
have
many
meeting
with
ging
and
hilgard
attend
at
least
at
one
before
the
meeting
he
describes
in
his
memoir
in
fact
this
be
well
attest
to
by
others
who
work
with

both
later
and
at
the
time
thus
in
his
interrogation
in
baron
uexkl
be
much
less
precise
than
egger
but
quite
defnitive
about
the

say
that

as
a
result
become

the

put
down
his

remembrance
at

point
and
these
be
useful
in
understand
his

he
confess
that

yond
reading

he
have
never

than
a
small
fraction
of

period
at
the
end
of
he
do
listen
to
speech
by
von

hitler
and
like
most
of
those
with
whom
he
consort
in
educate
and
wealthy
circle
be
impressed
by
the
difference
between
the
rhetoric
of
the
two
men
while
put
off
by
hitler
s
speech
he
be
surprised
by
how
hitler
s
follow
have
grown
and
note
that
in
the
propaganda
struggle
with
the
communist
it
be
not
the
social
demo
cratic
party
and
other
party
but
rather
the
nazi
that
held
the
feld
indeed
schmitt
argue
that
in
the
industrial
area
and
the
ruhr
anxiety
about
a
left
block
lead
by
the
communist
be
very
great
the
nsdap
skillfully
played
upon
the
need
to
cleanse
public
life
recognize
achievement
protect
private
property
save
the
mittelstand
and
the
like
add
to
this
be
the
failure
of
the
parliamen
tary
system
in
germany
there
be
too
many
party
and
there
be
too
much
partisan
politics
this
be
in
sharp
contrast
to
england
for
which
schmitt
have
great
admiration
where
the
number
of
party
be
small
and
the
governmental
transition
smooth
the
national
socialist
claim
to
be
above
party
be
par
ticularly
appeal
in
this
context
and
schmitt
consider
especially
promising
its
advocacy
of
the
right
to
work
and
its
pledge
to
end
the
demoralization
of
youth
needle
to
say
these
be
not
terribly
original
or
interest
explanation
in
themselves
they
refected
the
thought
of
a
person
who
paid
little
attention
to
politics
and
whose
anxiety
about
the
exist
situation
above
all
the
threat
of
communism
and
distaste
for
politics
have
render
him
oblivious
to
the
moral
difference
between
one
kind
of
political
party
and
another
schmitt
in
fact
be
a
perfect
illustration
of
the
antidemocratic
political
culture
of
important
segment
of
the
business
community
inherit
from
the
old
empire
and
carry
on
into
the
weimar

in
contrast
to
many
more
conservative
business
men
who
be
attract
to
franz
von
papen
s
authoritarian
and
conservative
program
schmitt
who
do
not
come
from
any
old
establishment
and
have
risen
on
the
strength
of
his
own
talent
be
probably
for
such
reason
more
ready
to
place
his
trust
in

co
confessional
they
be
loud
frivolous
and
presumptuous
beyond
all
measure
along
with
it
they
have
the
unpleasant
characteristic
of
systematically
only
draw
jew
into
their
circle
this
type
be
very
strongly
represent
in
the
legal
profession
when
i
think
back
to
the
favag
trial
and
the
unheard
of
manner
in
which
i
be
treat
in
the
hearing
like
a
person
ac
cused
then
i
can
only
today
be
thankful
to
the
preside

the
state

that
i
be
spar
have
to
defend
myself
there
be
also
very
unpleasant
type
of
this
kind
in
economic

such
a
person
be
for
example
sobernheim
of
the
commerzbank
whom
i
knew
particularly
well
from
the
favag
trial
and
of
whom
i
have
the
most
unpleas
ant
remembrance
such
people
rode
roughshod
over
the
interest
of
other
people
with
cold
bloodedness
and
cynicism
it
be
certainly
false
to
generalize
such
phenomenon
there
be
christian
who
be
second
to
none
in
what
have
be
described
and
there
be
jew
who
i
have
always
only
admire
for
their
fneness
and
selfessness
in
thought
which
they
combine
with
the
great
possible
capacity
and
feel
of
responsibility
this
then
be
the
context
in
which
schmitt
view
the
plan
for
the
jew
express
by
ging
before
and
immediately
after
the
seizure
of
power
i
must
honestly
say
that
i
have
no
reservation
about
this
line
for
it
cannot
objectively
be
contest
that
in
our
public
and
intellectual
life
begin
with
the
reichstag
in
the
press
and
also
in
many
scientifc
faculty
in
the
legal
feld
and
above
all
in
the
berlin
banking
business
the
jew
have
too
strong
and
too
loud
and
also
an
unhealthy
infuence
a
certain
push
of
them
back
and
hold
them
to
great
modesty
can
only
be
desire
and
good
many
a
jewish
friend
have
confrmed
this
as
his
own
view
schmitt
erinnerungen
fha
nl
pp
f
manifestly
neither
schmitt
s
politics
nor
his
view
on
the
jewish
question
be
unique
to
himself
and
he
be
right
in
say
that
there
be
jew
who
felt
that
they
be
bring
some
of
the
criticism
upon
themselves
nevertheless
schmitt
be
not
just
any
person
but
rather
the
general
director
of
germany
s
lead
insurance
company
and
a
public
fgure
of
great
importance
he
be
go
to
learn
a
thing
or
two
during
the
come
year
but
not
ala
as
much
as
one
could
hope
give
his
post
refection
at
the
same
time
however
it
be
important
to
recognize
that
the
responsibility
for
the
evil
that
he
and
his
organization
be
to
experience
and
perpetrate
during
the
come
year
lay
to
an
important
extent
in
the
fact
that
he
and
others
like
him
share
a
political
culture
and
an
anti
semitic
posture
that
make
the
come
and
installation
of
the
third
reich
possible
see
for
example
the
proposal
of
georg
solmssen
a
director
of
the
deutsche

to
ging
that
a
jewish
national

then
a

we

now
begin
to
politicize
for
we

rather
that
the

politicize
through

must
work

the

a

nevertheless
schmitt
be

than

he

it

there

however
the

dimension
not
only
because
of
measure
against

also

the
concern
be
not

of
the

be
indicative

that
he

vision
of

mainly
involve
the
creation
of
a
political
environment
in
which
the

could
recover

with

concern

schmitt
contin
ued
to
make
his
usual
argument
that
recovery
ultimately
depend
on
private
initiative
and
not
the
state
what
be
need
be
the
reconstruction
of
pur
chase
power
as
demonstrate
by
the
fact
that
insurance
policy
purchase
by
individual
be
average
no
more
than
rm
increase
purchasing
power
would
be
possible
only
if
people
be
economically
active
to
achieve
this
it
be
necessary
to

spark

into
the

that

home
ownership

schmitt
be
thus
a
believer
in
the
idea
that
the
economy
could
recover
only
if
it
be
ignite
after
which
it
would
continue
under
its

to

a
climate

urgent
in

intervention
by

agen

ging
respond
by
point
out
that
if
german
businessmen
refuse
to
participate
then
they
ought
not
wonder
and
complain
when
the
dogmatic
per
son
in
the
party
determine
the
fate
of
the
economy
the
reich
chancellor
and
he
would
like
to
have
at
the
head
of
the
economics
ministry
a
person
who
have
be
successfully
active
in
business
practice
his
own
and
the
reich
chancellor
s
support
would
guarantee
my
authority
schmitt
ask
for
an
opportunity
to
think
the
matter
over
and
claim
to
have
found
the
decision
very
diffcult
since
he
have
no
political
ambition
and
enjoy
his
present
work
however
he
also
felt
that
the
fate
of
germany
now
lay
in
the
hand
of
the
national
socialist
who
have
an
absolute
majority
in
the
reich
tag
that
this
majority
have
be
attain
by
exclusion
of
the
opposition
and
by
terror
do
not
apparently
disturb
him
in
any
case
he
believe
this
be
an
op
portunity
to
ensure
that
the
german
economy
would
continue
to
have
private
enterprise
as
its
basis
and
that
foreign
trade
which
he
consider
in
dire
need
of
support
could
be
strengthen
he
evidently
also
felt
that
he
could
do
some
thing
about
the
jewish
situation
ironically
it
be
because
of
his
summons
to
ging
that
schmitt
be
com
pelled
to
miss
a
meeting
of
the
group
warburg
have
assemble
on
the
problem
of
the
jew
which
he
have
plan
to
attend
and
which
have
produce
a
memoran
dum
outline
their
program
however
the
group
do
not
know
where
to
send
the
document
or
whether
it
be
wise
to
send
it
at
all
schmitt
when
inform
them
of
the
reason
for
his
nonattendance
suggest
that
the
time
be
probably
not
right
to
submit
such
a
document
because
thing
have
once
again
become
much
bad
he
also
indicate
that
if
negotiation
on
take
over
the
rwm
come
to
a
positive
result
then
thing
will
be
well
since
schmitt
intend
to
secure
certain
commitment
as
part
of
his
price
for
take
on
the
new

have
no
choice
fill
with
a
sense
of
responsibility
i
set
aside
my
reservation

consider
it
my
duty
toward
my

toward
the

to
take
over

thereby
prevent

take
schmitt

not

most

however
be
the
testimony
of
the

of

who
write
on

public
walk
in

even
after

it
be
hard
to
imagine
that
this
go
unnoticed
accord
to

schmitt
have
already

jeidels
claimed
that
schmitt
have
be
outrage
by
the
national
socialist
government
even
if
he
be
realist
enough
to
recognize
its
strength
schmitt
express
frequent
concern
to
jeidels
about
the
violent
behavior
that
accompany
the
national
socialist
seizure
of
power
in
early
but
he
also
argue
that
it
have
at
least
come
into
existence
constitutionally
in
form
and
that
its
existence
be
a
reality
require
that
one
have
to
exercise
infuence
over
it
through
a
certain
measure
of
collaboration
thus
it
be
extraordinarily
diffcult
for
kurt
schmitt
to
accept
hitler
s
call
and
he
also
spoke
to
me
at
that
time
about
his
positive
consideration
about
his
conscience
pang
and
about
his
personal
problem
as
to
a
friend
in

he
have
confdence
in
jeidel

schmitt

stood
at
the
peak
of
his
business
career
have
nothing
whatever
to
gain
from
take
the
offce
and
be
indeed
make
a
sacrifce
in
the
hope
that
hitler
would
respond
to
it
by
support
him
schmitt
told
jeidels
that
he
even
hop
he
could
eliminate
the
party
s
anti
semitism
or
at
least
tone
it
down
jeidels
be
less
sanguine
but
he
do
not
seem
in
any
way
to
have
try
to
dis
suade
schmitt
from
take
the

deeply

and
honorable

schmitt
make
a

point

this
positive
view
of
his
decision
be
share
not
only
by
his
friend

but
also
by
the

at

the

he

great
sacrifce
to
prevent
the

delude

hence
there
be
another
side
to
the
coin
of
his
anxiety
about

new

and
he
could
hardly
be
oblivi
ous
to
its
violent
nature
namely
a
measure
of
enthusiasm
and
willingness
to
believe

all
would
be
well
as

who
himself

may

the
take

be
thought
neither
from
the
side
of
herr
dr
schmitt
nor
from
the
side
of
the
reich
chancellor
as
a
passing
matter
on
the
con
trary
we
hope
that
he
will
remain
to
year
in
this
post
fortunately
we
do
not
live
any
longer
in
a
democratic
state
in
which
the
fate
of
the
cabinet
be
dependent
on
chang
ing
majority
it
be
certainly
a
great
sacrifce
for
schmitt
to
leave
allianz
just
as
thing
be
settle
down
after
the
favag
acquisition
and
to
take
up
the
heavy
burden
of
public
offce
but
as
kisskalt
report
schmitt
be
thoroughly
confdent
about
this
and
just
as
in
his
speech
yesterday
to
the
business
leader
so
also
in
detailed
private
conversation
with
me
he
have
give
expression
to
his
absolute
optimism
with
respect
to
a
favorable
development
and
his
continually
increase
admiration
for
the
great
statesmanlike
quality
of
the
reich
chancellor
hitler
we
can
therefore
look
into
the
future
with
the
great
confdence
and
always
console
ourselves
with
respect
to
the
allianz
that
if
the

expert
economic

to

but
also
to
become
part
of
the

itself
for
the
simple
reason
that
he
believe
that

have
produce
the
kind
of

schmitt
accepted
the
offer
there
can
be
no
question
about
the
fact
that
he
have
a
peculiar
penchant
for
wear
the
uniform
on
public
occasion
that
he
cut
an

the

against

be
also
quite

the
substantive
point
seem
to
be
that
the
daf
have
plan
to
abscond
with
the
idea
of
form
reich
group
by
establish
such
group
for
itself
in
the
form
of
its
company
group
which
would
effectively
organize
the
entire

thus
the
daf
would
have
a
branch
group
devote
to
insurance
and
compose
of
private
insurance
the
publicly
charter
company
and
social

most
importantly
lencer
sketch
a
scheme
under
which
both
social
and
economic
matter
would
come
under
its
control
thus
question
of
basic
wage
and
work
condition
would
be
discuss
in
the

group
and
the
labor
trustee
would
be
call
in
only
as
an
agency
of
last
resort
similarly
in
response
to
a
question
by

who
be
clearly
alarmed
at
the
prospect

inter
ference

anything
lencer
recognize
that
the
technical
side
of
the
insurance
business
need
expertise
in
the
initial
phase
however
he
go
on
to
suggest
that
the
daf
and
economic
organization
would
frst
work
parallel
to
one
an
other
but
would
then
grow
together
in
one
organization
thus
the
educative
function
now
appear
to
be
merely
a
transitory
phase
during
which
daf
off
cials
would
learn
to
interfere
in
every
aspect
of

this

be
indicative
of

most
important
problem
the
extent
to
which
his

fle
the
tendency
to
openly
discriminate
against
the
jew
in

be
an
especially
sore
point
schmitt
make
no
secret
of
the
fact
that
he
view
the

as
a
kind
of
sanctuary
for

from
the
aryan
paragraph
and
that
there
be
no
jewish
question
in
the
economy
thus
to
at
least
some
extent
he
kept
his
promise
to
his
jewish
business
colleague
and
make
the
acceptance
of

not

it
pave

paid

schmitt
a

his
berlin
home
on

in
consequence
of
the
attempt

launch
by
some
of
his
closest
collaborator
initially
schmitt
take
a
six
month
leave
because
hitler
ask
him
to
stay
on
as
economics

the
impression
that

schmitt
be

invitation

this

my

from

that
other

more

they
also
provide

the

him
to

which
undoubtedly
played
no

so

he

complicate

where
the

cumbersome

these
argument
persuasive

only
on

establish

that
the
alternative

the
danger

whether
the

should
not
terminate

however
take
the
position
that
the
few
jewish
pensioner
in

among

freudenburg
have
paid
into
the

and
thus
have
a
claim

he
inform
the
man
who
be
freudenburg
s
successor
in

general

alfred

the

who
have
paid
into
such

be
not
obliterate
by
their
have
to
retire
because
of

and
he
want
wiedemann
to
be
aware
of
this
position
should
the
question

up

sition

even
if

could

this

tricky
business
eichbaum
be
sent
to
south
africa
thanks
to
an
agreement
between
kurt

and

minister

and
this
be
view
as
useful
in
promote
germany
s
colonial
ambition
the
attitude
toward
the
employment
of
jew
abroad
toughen
up
under
schacht
s
successor
funk
in
part
because
of
the
radicalization
of
policy
toward
the
jew
and
in
part
because
of
the
tight
ening
of
foreign
exchange
control
thus
in
september
the
rwm
require
that
continued
employment
of
jew
abroad
and
payment
to
them
be
subject
to
careful
scrutiny
and
agreement
on
the
part
of
the
relevant
agency
and
that
company
make
every
effort
to
terminate
all
contract
with
jew
as
rapidly
as
possible
the
employment
of
eichbaum
ostensibly
in
a
special
category
nevertheless
produce
minor
and
major
problem
among
the
former
be
that
schmitt
be
hound
in
by
a
disgruntle
insurance
regulator
and
his
wife
who
charge
that
the
concern
be
show
an
insuffcient
understand
of
the
jewish
intrigue
by
send
jew
like
eichbaum
as
representative
to
south
africa
and
pay
them
fantastic
settlement
much
more
signifcant
how
ever
be
that
the
rwm
begin
raise
question
aboutthe
status
of
south
african
liberal
and
whether
it
be
bring
in
foreign
exchange
the
underlie
reason
for
this
concern
be
pressure
from
the
party
in
connection
with
eichbaum
and
offcials
at
the
ministry
privately
told
allianz
executive
they
do
not
think
eich
baum
could
be
retain
nevertheless
eichbaum
continued

actively
indeed
too
actively
for
some
of
his
south
african
colleague
who
be
not
free
of
anti
semitism
either
and
this
lead
to
plea
by
the
berlin
director
that
eichbaum
stay
in
the
background
as
much
as
possible
while
eichbaum
be
greatly
admire
for
his
competence
by
schmitt

he
his
forceful
personality

hop
would
enable

the

that

be
willing
to
help
him
both
with
respect
to

with

letter
of

although

be
to
no

because
direc

the

be
of
special

bruck
who
want
to
continue
his
career
and
he
be
take
aback
when
he
receive
a
rather
laconic
and
cool
certifcation
of
his
work
for

after
he
complain
to
re
however
bruck
receive
a
much
more
detailed
let
ter
that
described
his
virtue
and
capacity
it
demonstrate
that
his
leadership
of
the
large
breslau
offce
have
be
exceptional
and
thus
make
obvious
that
his
departure
which
be
described
as
the
product
of
mutual
agreement
be
a
genuine
loss
hence
it
obviously
require
some
pressure
and
threat
of
negative
publicity
to
induce
the
management
of
allianz
to
dismiss
jewish
employee
at
the
same
time
however
employee
in
signifcant
position
could
hardly
escape
the
real
ities
of
the
situation
such
an
individual
be
han
gerson
a
section
head
of

who
have
join
the

in
when
he
also
join

an
offcer
he
have
also
perform
various
patriotic
act
during
the
french
occupation
of
the
ruhr
nevertheless
he
anticipate
be
let
go
but
want
to
ease
his
situation
as
much
as
possible
since
he
be
married
and
have
a
very
small
child
the
dilemma
be
that
even
though
he
be
the
most
senior
person
in
the
pension
fund
he
would
qualify
only
after
attain
the
age
of
and
after
ffteen
year
of
membership
that
be
in
although
allianz
make
exception
to
this
rule
by
predate
membership
in
the

when
recruiting
person
who
have
paid
into

elsewhere
gerson
petition
in
february
for
exceptional
consideration
on
the
ground
that
he
be
not
responsible
for
his
anticipate
separation
and
that
hermes
have
no
economic
reason
to
let
him
go
either
yet
in
this
case
as
in
other
case
of
sep
aration
from
non
aryan
employee
the
allianz
pension
fund
refuse
to
make
an
exception
to
its
rule
and
would
only
pay
back
his
contribution
it
would
seem
however
that
gerson
anticipate
a
negative
reply
but
want
to
have
it
in
write
because
he
have
connection
through
his
father
with
person
in
bank
ing
and
industry
who
be
prepared
to
help
him
out
if
he
could
demonstrate
his
non
entitlement
to
a
pension
there
be
no
record
available
as
to
when
gerson
actually
left
the
concern
or
his
subsequent
fate
but
he
clearly
recognize
that
the
correspondence
on
the
bruck
case
which
run
between
dec
and
aug
be
to
be
found
in
fha

a
his
day
with
allianz
be
numbered
irrespective
of
his
record
and
his
service
to
hermes
the
company
initially
displayed
considerable
reluctance
to
terminate
its
rela
tionship
with
jewish
salesperson
and
agent
a
tell
example
be
provide
by
a
frankfurt
insurance
agent
name
han
grebaum
who
have
work
for
the
stuttgart
branch
of
allianz
and
for
neue
frankfurter
since
in
al
lianz
extend
the
contract
for
fve
year
and
then
prolong
the
contract
again
in
june
until
the
end
of
august
they
be
clearly
intent
on
maintain
ing
the
relationship
but
grebaum
s
continued
service
for
allianz
inevitably
attract
the
attention
of
the
authority
become
the
subject
of
unpleasant
newspaper
article
and
fnally
a
letter
from
the
gauleiter
s
offce
express
as
tonishment
that
allianz
continued
to
employ
a
jewish
agent
in
this
manner
at
this
point
the
pressure
be
too
great
and
allianz
terminate
the
contract
in
early
june
apparently
grebaum
who
subsequently
emigrate
to
the
united
state
negotiate
directly
with
general
director
he
an
agreement
be
reach
that
he
receive
his
full
annual
commission
of
rm
that
be
to
the

end
of
a
central
argument
for
retain
jew
as
insurance
agent
be
that
their
em
ployment
be
necessary
to
service
the
need
of
jewish
customer
thus
at
a
meeting
of
the
branch
head
of
neue
frankfurter
in
late
june
general
di
rector

declare
that
insofar
as
the
aryan
question
with
reference
to
the
sale

be
concerned
we
stand
in
agreement
with
the
authoritative
body
of
the
labor
front
and
the
industrial
economy
that
in
view
of
the
maintenance
of
jewish
business
in
take
the
position
that
so
long
as
all
the
operating
corporation
in
germany
have
not
realize
the
aryan
princi
ple
the
dismissal
of
non
aryan
sale
representative
can
only
lead
to
substantial
damage
to

that
be
neither
in
the
interest
of
the

in

we
have
to

into

now
give
up
our
contractual

jewish

insofar
as
this
have
not

happen
this
be
all
the
more

otherwise
the

this
be

in

the

have
on

a

that
exclude

the

the

the
legitimation

that

little
with

as
possible
whatever
the

the
only
positive
aspect

he
thus
found
himself
in
the
humiliate
position
of
not
have
enough
business
to
cover
even
the
commission
guaranteed
by
his

in
september
goldmann
turn
to
general

he
about
his
plight

it

that
every

be
met
by
you
with
under
stand
and
an
open
heart
in
his
distress
and
anxiety
goldmann
point
out
that
he
be
be
ruin
not
only
materially
but
also
spiritually
by
the
in
activity
impose
upon
him
by
the
contract
and
note
that
other
insurance
company
be
not
conclude
such
contract
with
their
jewish
agent
in
other
large

he
plead
with
he
to
be
allow
to
serve
as
a
general
agent
in
berlin
where
he
have
good

contact

express
the
hope

fnding
with
you
the

that
would
make
it
possible
for
me
to
secure

which
even
if
modest
secures
me
an
honorable
existence
he
agree

see
goldmann
although
the
latter
end
up
meeting
with

alfred

instead
and

told
goldmann
he
would

a
grateful
goldmann
respond
by
assure
haase
that
he
would
work
with
all
his
strength
to
fulfll
the
expectation
place
in
him

as
if

life
insurance
policy
at
a
publishing

in

despite
the
good

all
around
however
the
plan
to
transfer
goldmann
take
a
turn
for
the
bad
in
january
because
as
director
haase
learn
from
his
colleague
director
kig
it
be
not
at
all
certain
that

by
february
it
be
clear
that
a
move
to
berlin
be
out
of
the
question
and
goldmann
decide
to
seek

the

indis
cussable

ask
that

that

this
be
especially
the
case
since
it

by
no
mean
certain
that
the

would
have
the
same
value
in

fu

presumably
because
of
the
number
of
jewish

on

also
in

have
be
renew
in
the
spring

once
again
however
the
pressure
on
allianz
to
end
the
relationship
increase
by
to
the
point
where
the
pototzky
breslau
branch
agree
to
give
up
its
aryan
business
to
the
local
branch
of
allianz
in
re
turn
for
a

total
rm
a

to

divide
between
the
two
brother
in

han
and
fritz
pototzky
in
the
pressure
be
on
to
terminate
the
contract
with
ludwig
pototzky
who
head
the
berlin
branch
in
contrast
to
the
breslau
settlement
no
direct
mention
be
make
of
allianz
take
over
the
portfolio
because
director
kig
express
fear
that
the
party
would
get
wind
of
such
an
arrangement
and
object
to
the
purchase
of
such
business
from
a
jew
ludwig
pototzky
therefore
agree
to
a
pension
of
rm
a
year
but
it
be
fairly
obvious
as
pototzky
s
lawyer
argue
after
the
war
that
a
year
old
businessman
earn
between
and
rm
a
year
would
not
consider
this
pension
to
be
genuine
compensation
to
make
matter
bad
when
pototzky
decide
to
emigrate
to
england
in
august
he
could
not
col
lect
his
pension
there
and
thus
agree
to
a
settlement
of
rm
of
this
however
only
rm
could
be
take
out
the
country
the
rest
be
eat
up
by
special
tax
or
put
into
a
block

pototzky
thus
end
up
lose
both
his
portfolio
and
his
pension
and
here
the
gainer
be
clearly

my
future
be
now
completely
unclear
i
do
not
to
be
sure
think
that
allianz
will
leave
me
in
the
lurch
that
would
certainly
be
the
absolute
bad
after
year
of
strenuous
work
in
building
up
a
portfolio
the
like
of
which
almost
no
one
else
have
be
drop
would
be
a
catastrophe
for
me
i
have
regard
my
portfolio
as
a
security
for
my
old
age
and
to
be
sure
with
full
justifcation
for
the
contract
with
guaranteed
portfolio
be
make
with
me
for
life
so
that
a
breach
of
faith
to
me
in
this
respect
will
be
almost
like
suicide
but
i
cannot
and
will
not
believe
it
since
only
a
short
time
ago
i
have
receive
assurance
on
their
word
of
honor
from
my
high
superior
a
few
day
later
he
and
kig
inform
him
that
he
would
have
to
be
let
go
at
the
end
of
the
year
but
that
they
fully
recognize
his
achievement
and
hop
to
get
him
a
position
in
switzerland
this
would
mean
leave
behind
a
portfo
lio
which
brought
him
an
annual
income
of
rm
if
thing
do
not
work
out
in
switzerland
lachmann
would
become
a
pensioner
at
the
begin
of
the
new
year
yet
the
big
problem
as
he
and
goudefroy
inform
him
be
that
his
long
stand
contract
could
not
be
carry
out
because
he
be
a
non
aryan
i
could
not
get
my
pension
from
this
portfolio
because
from
a
portfolio
whose
large
portion
have
to
be
term
aryan
a
non
aryan
cannot
derive
income
this
be
completely
mysterious
to
me
since
this
business
be
make
at
a
time
when
such
law
do
not
exist
and
as
my
contract
expressly
state
constitutes
a
specifc
portion
of
my
honorably
earn
commission
apparently
his
prospect
in
switzerland
do
not
work
out
and
his
effort
to
get
out
of
germany
be
not
successful
either
in
return
for
his
portfolio
allianz
give
him
a
pension
of
rm
a
year
as
well
as

a

for
his
wife

that

about

and
one
be
in
the

of
the
reich

while
it
be
certainly
true
as
allianz
argue
after
the
war
that
all
the
property
in
question
be
subject
to
eminent
domain
and
have
to
be
sell
three

yet
another
held
by
the

be
sell
for
above
assess

by
comparison
three
of
the
four
jewish
property
be
sell
for
between
and
below
their
assess
worth
it
be
important
to
realize
that
the
assess
value
be
usually
kept
artifcially
low
for
tax
reason
so
that
a
high
price
especially
in
case
where
property
be
be
sell
unwillingly
and
under
threat
of
eminent
domain
be
fully
ap
propriate
thus
despite
the
ban
on
price
increase
in
force
at
this
time
the

permit
payment
over

always

sometimes
it

this

make

the
fnance

real

it

do
not

consider
the
proposition

us
for

that
later
our

can
set
up

there
the

be
also
extraordinarily
suitable
for
effective
advertising
allianz
thus
view
it
as
a
very
good
and
by
no
mean
risky
investment
most
signif
cant
for
the
discussion
here
however
be
that
allianz
knew
full
well
that
it
could
strengthen
its
case
by
employ
the
immense
tax
problem
face
by
the
basch
family
after
the
various
imposition
on

follow
the

pogrom
the
present
sale
of
the

be
also
of
signifcance
to
the
public
interest
we
submit
a
letter
of
the
trustee
in
conformity
to
the
decision
of
the
government
president
of
up
per
bavaria
of
september
in
which
it
be
point
out
that
the

be
absolutely
necessary
for

could

for

worried
about
it

suffcient

this
be
a
real
issue
despite
all
the
protective
regulation
and
while
the
public
be
told
that
there
be
nothing
to
worry
about
there
be
a
genuine
danger
that
the
german
branch
of
phix

could
go
bankrupt
if
negotia
tions
for
its
liquidation
and
the
assumption
of
its
policy
fail
thus
in
may
the
economics
ministry
summon
the
insurance
industry
organization
leader
to
discus
the
situation
one
could
argue
that
the
german
insurer
have
no
obligation
to
save
the
branch
of
a
foreign
company
from
a
bankruptcy
that
it
have
brought
upon
itself
but
insurance
organization
leader
dismiss
such
no
tions
because
they
overlook
the
heart
of
the
matter
which
be
that
the
existence
of
many
german
family
be
at
stake
and
on
the
other
side
that
the
bankruptcy
of
the
german
branch
of
the
phix
life
would
be
a
heavy
blow
to
the
entire
german
life
insurance
business
the
conclusion
be
that
a
common
action
by
the
insurer
to
prevent
such
a
bankruptcy
be
necessary
in
the
form
of
a
guaran
tee
for
such
loss
as
have
be
incur
this
be
warmly
support
by

who
point
out
that
his
company
have
bow
out
of
the
phix

long
before

that
he
felt
an
obligation
nonetheless

in
surance
company
have
put
up
a
million
pengguarantee
for
their
phix
life
branch
and
what
the
hungarian
insurance
business
can
do
be
easily
possible
for
thegerman
enterprise
which
be
much
strong
incapital
one
have
to
avoid
everything
that
be
likely
to
promote
the
view
that
the
german
insurance
business
be
not
healthy
there
be
only
one
negative
voice
general
director

who
argue
that
phix

have
do
nothing
but
ruin
their
business
and
that
policyholder
have
go
to
phix

primarily
for
speculative
reason
and
thus
deserve
no
protection
the
prevail

be
that

to
explicate

conception

the
role

enterprise
in

economic
order
whether
we
now

enter
into

whether

work
through

we
always

of

more
directly
to
be
sure
the
concrete
issue
be
once
again
embel
lished
with
dramatic
language
and
embed
in
the
ideological
discourse
of
the
third

as
hilgard

once
again
to
save
the

principle

talist

not
to

however
that

continue

work
for
the
proftability

the
maintenance
of
the
eco

he
who

throw
economic
effciency

the
strive

overboard

sac
rifces
his

in
a
falsely

sense

go
to

as

because

believe
that

can
set
aside
the
eternally
valid
law

then
move
from
these
spiritual
and
intellectual
height
to
the
bread

issue
present
by

all
area
of

ance
would
be
affected
in
one
way

would

involve
for
example
fre

and
fight

in
every
case
hilgard
be
not
surprisingly
worried
about
the
implication
of
the
four

plan
for
his
industry
fire

chine
breakdown

after
all
to
be
anticipate
in
an
economy
about
to
be
so
massively
overheat
the
dilemma
be
that
it
would
be
diffcult
to
increase
premium
precisely
because
the
great
risk
be
be
incur
in
the
national
cause
there
have
be
for
example
enormous
pressure
on
the
fre
insurer
to
reduce
their
premium
and
hilgard
claimed
there
have
be
substantial
reduction
during
the
past
few
year
whose
general
invisibility
refected
the
fact
that
most
reduction
be
handle
individ
ually
the
high
profts
come
from
old
policy
and
hilgard
urge
that
they
be
put
into
reserve
so
as
to
have
a
basis
for
deal
with
the
anticipate
in
crease
in
damage
due
to
the
four
year
plan
at
the
same
time
he
appeal
to
the
branch
to
reduce
premium
and
improve
the
quality
of
protection
for
raw
material
producer
work
for
the
four
year
plan
he
expect
the
machine
insurance
branch
to
experience
particular
stress
because
of
production
demand
and
warn
that
only
internally
very
powerful
and
strong
corporation
would
be
able
to
handle
the
insurance
in
this
branch
the
obvious
implication
be
again
that
the
big
insurance
company
would
be
best
suit
to
meet
the
requirement
the
discussion
and

that
their

soundness
be
of
central
importance
for
such
reason
hilgard
have
some
particularly
nasty
thing
to
say
about
the
price
competition
and
lack
of
discipline

by
the

warn
that

to

on

important
as
a

of

hand
the

be
be
criticize
for
have
too
passive
a
foreign

balance
and
hilgard
urge
that
the
ger
man
company
undertake
more
of
their
own
reinsurance
and
reevaluate
their
foreign

connection

of
the
new

and
still
keep

from
this
perspective
hilgard
worried
greatly
about
the
pressure
emanate
from
critic
of
the
indus
try
in
the
daf

anxiety
that
come
through
even
as
he
express
their

commonality
of

he
warn
against
pressure
to
overregulate
insurance
agent

agency
as
demand
by

and
be
particularly
oppose
to
the
expansion
of
group
insurance
for
each
occupational
group
and
profession
which
he
castigate
as
collective
selfshness
if
each
occupational
group
join
together
for
insurance
purpose
then
nothing
would
be
left
but
high
risk
customer
an
obviously
undesirable
situation
for
insurance
compa
ny
in
short
the
private
insurance
industry
have
to
be
on
its
guard
as
it
face
the
new
demand
of
the
four

plan

as
hilgard
note
in
a
rare
moment
of
straightforwardness
w

face
the
mighty
block
of
the
german
labor
front
which
as
you
all
know
be
possess
with
an
extraordinary
urge

hil

that
the

be
not
to
fght
the

but
to
work
together
with
it
nevertheless
the
message
be
clear
to
those
who
understood
the
language
be
use
somehow
the
industry
have
to
demonstrate
its
worth
in
the
four
year
plan
or
succumb
to
its
enemy
in
the
party
and
regime
the
four
year
plan
meant
a
substantial
increase
in
the
insurance
industry
s
holding
of
government
paper
as
well
as
a
far
reduction
of
the
allege
vol
untarism
in
their
purchase
through
the
systematization
of
subscription
level
and
restriction
of
other
investment
option
this
development
become
particu
larly
evident
in
whereas
the
insurance
industry
be
suppose
to
contribute
million
rm
to
the
bond
drive
in
the
frst
half
of
the
contribution
be
raise
to
million
rm
for
the
second
half
of
the
year
furthermore
life
in
surance
company
be
expect
to
invest
a
minimum
of
of
their
yearly
premium
receipt
in
the
bond
issue
while
other
branch
be
require
to
invest
at
least
of
their
premium
receipt
the
rwm
assign
the
reich
group
the
task
of
monitoring
these
contribution
level
the
finance
and
economics
min
istries
also
expect
the
insurance
company
to
continue
their
exist
level
of
subscription
to
longer
term
reich
loan
issue
by
the
government
the
mil
lion
rm
bond
purchase
be
consider
a
supplementary
investment
also
the
regime
have
obviously
learn
from
the
experience
of
the
first
world
war
when
company
use
previously
purchase
war
bond
to
pay
for
new
one
insurance
company
be
warn
that
the
investment
in
question
be
to
be
make
from
current
income
and
not
from
the
sale
of
previously
purchase
state
security
indeed
a
secret
reich
economics
ministry
decree
order
that
the
company
be
to
invest
all
available
monies
in
reich
bond
while
the
provision
of
money
or
grant
of
mortgage
for
new
housing
construction
be
ban
similarly
the
purchase
of
real
estate
be
allowable
only
with
special
permission
and
this
explains
the
elaborate
argument
in
allianz
s
purchase
of
kaufngerstra
e
in
munich
discuss
earlier
the
insurance
company
hop
that
both
the
size
of
subscription
and
the
restriction
on
investment
would
be
reduce
in
but
they
be
rapidly
disabuse
of
such
fantasy
indeed
hilgard
inform
his
colleague
in
january
that
the
life
insurance
company
be
expect
to
provide
a
minimum
of
of
their
premium
income
to
the
bond
drive
while
the
reichsbank
report
in
april
that
the
insurance
industry
have
purchase
rm
in
reich
security
issue
by
the
reich
in
it
anticipate
that
the

would
provide

that
year
allianz

allianz

of
the
government
loan
by
insurance
industry
subscription
reach
billion
mark
for
the
year
hence
a
fundamental
consequence
of
the
four
year
plan
be
that
the
asset
of
insurance
company
be
increasingly
dominate
by
state
security
the
engagement
be
make
all
the
more
problematic

the
re
duction

the

amount

the
respective

for

and
there
be
of
course
other
important
area
of
investment
aside
from
real

mortgage
and
government
bond
but
in
some
case
these
have
become
problematic
although
allianz

it
be

not

by

out
they

that

there

therefore
be
the
necessary
authority
behind

it
be
therefore
important
to
assure
the
agreement
of
the

he
hilgard
have
found
in

have

understand

in

one
have
to
work
in
an

along
the

reveal
general
illustration
of
the
politics
of
the
insurance

at
this

also

it
help
explain
hilgard

decision
to
support
the

of

his
role
in
the
automobile

and
he
be
bless

the
ef
fort

to

would
have
the
effect

it
would
also
argue
the

endanger
the

set

thus
hil

two
point
have
to
be
kept
in

first
all
claim
to
the
contrary
the
popularity
of
the
private
insurance
business
between
and
exceed
that
of
the
publicly
charter
company
as
demon
strated
by
the
increase
in
customer
which
range
only
from
to
for
the
latter
but
from
to
for
the
former
that
so
many
people
insured
themselves
with
the
private
company
need
much
more
emphasis
in
hilgard
s
view
second
there
be
the
problem
of
foreign
exchange
in
the
inter
national
business
of
private
insurance
company
its
balance
have
be
negative
to
the
tune
of
million
rm
between
january
and
november
the
primary
reason
be
the
amount
of
business
they
be
do
with
english
and
swiss
rein
surers
the
fgures

it

strug

with
one
another
about
great
question
if
we
fulfll
the

then
he
bra
be
optimistic
enough
to
say
that
we
will
succeed
with
ging
with
the
mean
at
our

and
the
intention
that

have
the

present
will
understand
why
he
be
commit
to
authoritarian

there
should
be
no
other
opinion
than
that
of
the
leader
of
the
reich
group
or
in
the
case
of
the
private

his
own
also
in

this
should
be
the
alpha
and
omega
of
each
individual
leader
of
an

he
asks
all
the
gentleman
present
to
make
this
standpoint

perspective
be
the

then
we

constantly

until
a

we

a
battle

those
be
the
perspective
which
he
will
in
part
present
tomorrow
so
that
the
ground
be
prepared
so
that
the
insurance
industry
be
in
line
with
the
authoritarian
system
bra
certainly
be
not
a
great
analytical
mind
but
he
have
an
intuitive
under
stand
of
the
role
of
darwinian
confict
between
compete
force
in
the
func

of
the
nazi
dicatatorship
and
what
the
function
of
work
toward
the
frer
to
use
the
language
of
another
nazi
offcial
really
meant
to
a
practic
ing
national
socialist
of
this
type
as
become
clear
from
the
ensue

the
danger
be
indeed
take
quite
seriously
by
those
present
the
labor
ministry
once
so
supportive
of
the
insurance
industry
against
the
daf
apparently
have
plan
to
expand
the
social
insurance
system
it
sought
to
take
advantage
of
the
failure
of
private
insurance
company
to
do
enough
in
provide
insurance
for
craftsman
and
offering

thus
there
be
a

its
way

a
bad

sharply
attack
the

policy
of

argue
that
it
need
to
be
more
focus

centrally
direct

that

have
to

more

a

great
concern
in

in
the

he
call
for
less
competition

more

he
sharply
attack
the

be
concerned
he
urge
control

purge
undesirable
element
from
the
external
service
and
also
call
for
more
pool
of
risk
thus
create
the
impression
that
the
entire

be
very
wasteful
and
in
effcient
at
the

sharply
criticize
the

different

there

expect

the

he
described

tediously

his

the

that
he
be
an
old

accustom
to
political
bat
tles

of

bra
thought
the
separation
between
an
economic
group
for
private
insurance
and
an
economic
group
for
the
publicly
charter

tragic
because
it
en
couraged
a
business
hungry
attitude
instead
of
collaboration
for
the
common
good
he
therefore
propose
a
reich
group
that
would
encompass
both
type
of

company
and
a
division

automobile
accident
and
liability
health
transport
and
reinsurance
and
agriculture
as
in

group
so
in
each
of
these
economic
group
the
private
and
the
publicly
charter

would
work
together
it
be
essential
in
bra
s
view
that
these
group
be
lead
not
by
the

expert
but
instead
by
political
personality
who
would
approach
the
reorganization
of
the
industry
from
a
political
rather
than
business
or
techni
cal
perspective
indeed
the
entire
beneft
of
bring
the
two
type
of
insurance
company
together
would
come
from
the
fact
that
the
more
politically
orient
publicly
charter
company
would
no
longer
be
criticize
the
private
compa
ny
from
the
outside
instead
they
would
be
work
within
the
same
structure
and
could
thereby
directly
infuence
the
private
company
to
pursue
a
national
socialist
economic
policy

claimed
that
he
do
not
wish
to
make
any
personnel
recommendation
aside
from

he
could
hardly

that
everything

to

radical
in

it
insist
that

be
not
an
appropriate

for

since
by
its
very
nature
it
embrace
a

community
competition
simply
raise

he
make
much
of

he

urge
nationalization

there
can
be
no
question
that

be
most
serious
about
this
plan
on
july
schwarz
write
directly
to

claimed
that
the
true
reason
for
these

lie
almost
exclusively
in

seek
of

a
cleanse
of
the

its

not
and

never
be
possible
through

only
through
an
uncompromising

all
insist

necessarily
lead

since

initially

a

certainly
very
agreeable

when
it
come

however
schmitt

be
not
without
advantage
he
begin
by
point
out
that
the
decision
of
the

yourself
in
the
question
of

create
a
welcome
clarity
and
the
way
must
now
be
free
so
that
with
the
help
of
an
economic
leadership
guide
by
national
socialist
principle
the
high
conceivable
position
in
the

can
be
attain
in
this
feld
he
have
conveyed
this
view
to

but
from
a
purely
practical
view
the
old
game
continue
insofar
as
in
the
nomination
for
the
most
important
position
one
be
try
very
strongly
and
with
understandable
suc
ce
to
push
the
private
insurer
into
the
background
the
centerpiece
of
this
battle
be
the
elimination
of
hilgard
who
without
doubt
must
be
the
natural
leader
of
the

if
the
private

confict
be
not
quietly

schmitt

that

collaboration
be
impossible
if
the
struggle
be
go
to
continue
in
this
manner
as
a
former

schmitt
claimed
that
he
be
try
to
take
a
neutral
position

then

compel

the

a
matter
that

up

that

for

hilgard

interpretation
of

ft
in
nicely
with
his
own
emphasis
on
the
trial
tribulation
and
vulnerability
of

on
the
un
predictable
behavior
with
which
he
constantly
have
to
contend
the
confation
could
have
be
conscious
or
unconscious
and
it
be
not
impossible
that
ging
may
also
have
be
infuenced
by
hilgard
s
service
even
if
the
decisive
reason
be
the
power
of
large
private
insurer
in
the
industry
one
thing
for
certain
be
that
pander

need

seem
to
have
show
a
preference
for

up
strongly

his

may
have
notice
he
have
recently
be
at
a
small
gathering
with
hitler
and
there
be
a
good
deal
of
anger
that
so
many
viennese
jew
be
come
to

that
it
would
not
be
surprising
if
some
thing
be
do
about
it
bra
indicate
that
the
hitler
youth
be
likely
to
take
action
and
that
in
any
case
the
insurance
company
should
be
prepared
he
personally
would
not
insure
any
more
jew
however
as
point
out
by
gen
eral
director
anton
dietrich
kessel
one
of
the
berlin
glass
insurance
company
executive
there
be
policy
still
in
force
that
one
could
not
simply
elimi
nate
overnight
he
have
already
receive
report
of
jewish
store
window
be
deface
during

and
then
broken
at

the

have
be
consid
erable

ask
for
help
since
the
damage
be
not
be
do
to
the
jew
in
the
end
a
point
echoed
by
general
director
johannes
tiedke
of
alte
leipziger
who
observe
that
the
jew
can
only
be
harm
if
he
himself
be
the
owner
and
be
not
insured
non
jewish
german
would
have
to
pay
in
the
end
and
bad
yet
most
of
the
glass
come
from
abroad
bra
s
only
response
be
that
they
would
just
have
to
take
the
loss
when
kessel
urge
that
they
publish
newspa
per
article
point
out
these
fact
bra
reply
that
if
the
present
action
have
a
political
origin
then
the
press
will
not
take
such
an
article
at
the
present
time
kessel
then
suggest
that
they
simply
turn
down
such
claim
but
this
be
more
a
counsel
of
despair
than
a
real
answer
this
be
reveal
three
day
later

the

initially
such

be
confned

the
quotation
be
from
the
latter
pp

in
the
province
it
be
standard
practice
for

insurer
to
replace
the
bro
ken
glass
of
their
customer
rather
than
make
cash
payment
but
the
association
fear
that
the
immediate
installation
of
new
window
would
be
futile
under
ex
isting
condition
because
the
volume
of
report
be
increase
and
the
danger
of
repetition
be
great
the
association
recommend
that
the
regulation
be
delayed
and
the
insured
be
urge
to
use
emergency
glass
or
wood

for
the
time

until
a
measure

calm
have
take

its

on

regular

full
detail

all
such

in

it

that
some
of
the
most
signifcant
immi

refected
the
express
wish
and
intention
of

with
specifc

it

that

well

that

ance
claim
might

in

with

have

any
serious
discussion
of

by
order
that
the
jew
be
not
to
receive
insurance
compensation
needle
to
say
the
leadership
of
the
insurance
business
be
also
well
aware
that
the
fre
glass
and
especially
burglary
and
theft
branch
have
a
problem
on
their
hand
in
contrast
to
the
situation
in
june
however
it
be
obvious
from
the
outset
that
the
character
and
extent
of
the
damage
give
the
action
of
november
a
very
different
quality
from
those
of
june
and
that
the
government
be
likely
to
take
an
active
interest
in
the
insurance
aspect
of
the
pogrom
thus
on
no
vember
the
leadership
of
the
reich
group
sent
a
most
reveal
confdential
letter
to
the
organization
of
private

point
out
that

under
the

this
be
the
case
it
seem
absolutely
necessary
that
the

proceed
in
the
handle
of

totally
uniform

authority

party
agency
hilgard
in
his
capacity
as
head
of
the

for

therefore
ask
that
they
take
measure
as
quickly
as
possible
to
ensure
that
no
company
do
anything
to

this
unifed

on

one
hand
it
be
necessary
to
acknowledge
all
incoming

of

on
the
other
it
be
important
that
no

handle

this

absolutely

very
much
strengthens

argument

also

circular
of
the
economic
group
for
private

condition
because
of
its
foreign
business
it
be
impossible
to
have
two
set
of
condition
in
german
insurance
policy
furthermore
in
the
event
of
war
it
be
conceivable
that
domestic
communist
could
attempt
public
disturbance
or
that
diffculties
might
arise
in
area
evacuate
in
a
strategic
retreat
thus
the
insurer
argue
that
it
be
in
the
interest
of
the
national
socialist
state
to
maintain
the
clause
apparently
the
insurer
and
the
raa
easily
agree
on
this
compromise
the
latter
have
already
indicate
that
it
understood
the
need
to
take
foreign
business
into
account
but
the
matter
nevertheless
continued
to
hang
in
the
air
in
late
october
because
the
propaganda
ministry
persist
in
demand
that
the
terminology
be
remove
from
the
general
insurance
condi
tions
it
would
not
be
easy
to
openly
claim
that
the
event
of
november
be
a
civic
disturbance
when
goebbels
the
very
man
who
have
incite
them
in
sisted
that
civic
disturbance
no
longer
exist
in
national
socialist
germany
the
second

hilgard

effort
to
fnd
a
policy
for
deal
ing
with
insurance
claim
arise
from
the
pogrom
be
that
government
offcials
be
in
a
position
to
exercise
dictatorial
authority
with
respect
to
the
payment
or
nonpayment
of
insurance
claim
this
be
not
only
because
it
be
a
government
inspire
pogrom
that
have
create
the
complicate
situation
in
the
frst
place
and
that
one
of
the
unique
characteristic
of
totalitarian
state
be
that
they
be
in
a
position
to
arbitrarily
solve
the
problem
they
arbitrarily
create
it
be
also
be

the

clause
in
the
general

condition
if
it
deem
such
action
in
the
public
interest
the
insurance
industry
be
in
no
position
to
make
autonomous
decision
on
its
liability
with
the
confdence
that
it
could
fght
for
its
position
in
court
it
would
inevitably
have
to
come
to
term
with
the
authority
and
party
agency
finally
it
be
useful
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
sense
of
insecurity
in
the
reich
group
must
have
be
very
high
at
this
time
be
cause
as

previously
it

undergo
reorganization
and
it
be
by
no

certain
that
hilgard
would
retain
his
leadership
position
leader
he
be
however

it
be

a
matter
of

of
the
people
toward
the
jew
have
lead
to
a
great
deal
of
damage
to
property
and
person
ging
go
on
to
state
that
i
assume
that
a
portion
of
the
jew
probably
the
majority
be
also
insured
against
tumult
damage
etc
in
the
minute
of
the
meeting
hilgard
be
report
as
say
yes
to
this
remark
hilgard
yes
although
give
what
be
to
follow
this
be
probably
more
a
listen
noise
than
an
actual
confrmation
of
ging
s
assumption
ging
then
go
on
to
assure
hilgard
that
jewish
insurance
entitlement
arise
from
the
justifed
defense
of
the
people
against
the
jew
would
present
no
problem
here
the
matter
would
be
relatively
simple
in
that
i
would
issue
a
decree
that
these
damage
that
arise
from
this
outburst
be
not
to
be
cover
by
insurance
however
the
question
that
be
of
burning
interest
to
ging
and
which
be
why
he
have
summon
hilgard
be
whether
there
be
any
foreign
reinsurance
for
tumult
damage
insurance
he
want
to
discus
to
what
extent
this
rein
surance
which
might
possibly
yet
bring
foreign
exchange
do
not
come
to
the
jew
but
to
the
german
national
economy
ging
be
now
ready
to
let
hilgard
have
his
say
frst
as
to
the
matter
of
whether
the
jew
be
insured
against
the
damage
there
can
be
no
doubt
about
the
fact
that
ging
s
line
of
question
put
hilgard
in
a
very
diffcult
po
sition
because
it
be
quite
the
product
of
utter
ignorance
all
he
could
do
be
attempt
to
enlighten
ging
as
to
what
really
be
at
issue
the
matter
be
such
that
we
be
deal
with
three
type
of
insurance
and
to
be
sure
not
with
insurance
against
disturbance
and
tumult
damage
insurance
but
with
regular
fre
insurance
with
regular
glass
insurance
and
with
regular
simple
theft
insurance
the
in
sured
that
be
those
who
have
a
claim
on
the
basis
of
these
policy
be
in
part

in
part

with

to
the

the

those

identical
with
the

naturally
certainly
the

completely

into

up

well
what

meant
with
respect
to
fnishing
off

he
proceed
to
expatiate
on
the
glass
problem
point
out
that
the
shop

come
from
belgium
not
bohemia
and
estimate
that
we
must
expend
ap
proximately
million
under
the
insurance
condition
as
replacement
mainly
to
aryan
who
have
suffer

while
emphasize
that
this
could
only
be
an
estimate
because
of
time
constraint
and
modify
his
remark
to
point
out
that
jewish
merchant
do
suffer
glass
damage
insofar
as
they
be
the
owner
of
the
building
as
be
the
case
with
jewish
department
store
he
go
on
to
calculate
that
some
million
mark
worth
of
glass
be
available
in
germany
which
meant
that
another
million
mark
worth
of
glass
would
have
to
be
im
port
this
amount
to
half
a
year
of
belgium
s
production
so
that
it
probably
would
take
another
half
year
for
the
require

to
be

this
trig
gered

another
altercation
between

and

over
the
need
to
inform
the
people
about

which
the
latter
do
not
feel
possible
at
the

the
pogrom
have
be
an
exercise
not
only
in
destructive
vandal
ism
but
also
in
thievery
and
this
be
the
next
subject
to
which
ging
turn
in
what
so
far
have
be
a
very
frustrate
discussion
with
hilgard

want
to
know
if

that
be
take
out
of
shop
and
then
burn
to
which
hilgard
reply
negatively
be
it
then
a
case
of
civic
distur
bance
aufruhr
here
hilgard
be
uncertain
since
it
be
an
open
question
as
to
whether
use
of
good
after
an
entrance
or
container
have
be
forcibly
destroyed
constitute
thievery
or
simply
an
extension
of
the
civic
disturbance
ging
apparently
still
under
the
illusion
that
there
be
insurance
against
civic
disturbance
and
against
damage
arise
from
tumult
frst
declare
the
event
to
be
one
of
civil
disturbance
whereupon
hilgard
inform
him
that
such
in
surance
scarcely
exist
anymore
hilgard
take
as
his
example
their
big
thievery
case
the
jewelry
store
markgraf
on
unter
den

which
have
re

held
a
so
call

policy
that
seem
to
insure
it
against
every
possible
damage
after
ging
have
go
into
another
rage

on
heydrich
and
daluege
to
round
up
those
responsi
ble

use
the
party
to
go
after
anyone
who
seem
to
have
be
involve
in
ibid
loot
hilgard
go
on
to
say
that
the
damage
in
question
probably
do
not
fall
under
the
policy
nevertheless
he
make
this
statement
with
reservation
and
ask
ging
if
he
could
not
make
a
small
request
in
the
name
of
the
in
surance
industry
with
respect
to
their
liability
namely
that
we
not
be
block
in
the
fulfllment
of
our
contractual
obligation
this
be
necessary
hilgard
declare
because
of
their
international
business
which
be
very
important
and
brought
in
foreign
exchange
it
be
necessary
to
maintain
confdence
in
the
ger
man
insurance
business
and
failure
to
meet
their
contractual
obligation
would
constitute
a
black
spot
on
the
coat
of
honor
of
the
german
insurance
industry
ging
s
initial
reaction
to
this
suggestion
that
the
insurance
company
meet
such
liability
be
to
reiterate
that
he
would
issue
a
decree
that
would
provide
relief
but
when
hilgard
indicate
a
desire
to
discus
this
heydrich
chime
in
with
the
idea
that
the
insurance
company
should
pay
out
their
obligation
and
that
the
money
would
then
be
confscated
in
this
way
the
company
could
for
mally
save
face
hilgard
s
response
to
this
and
ging
s
interruption
along
with
hilgard
s
interjection
in
the
midst
of
ging
s
remark
be
most
reveal
hilgard
that
which
obergruppenfrer
heydrich
just
say
be
what
i
actually
also
consider
the
right
way
frst
to
use
the
apparatus
of
the
insurance
industry
to
determine
to
regulate
and
also
to
pay
out
but
then
to
give
the
insurance
industry
the
possibility
in
some
kind
of
fund
ging
one
moment
you
have
to
pay
out
in
any
case
because
german
be
dam
age
but
you
receive
a
legal
ban
against
make
the
payment
directly
to
the
jew
you
must
also
pay
the
damage
that
you
would
have
have
to
pay
to
the
jew
but
not
to
the
jew
but
to
the
finance
minister
hilgard
aha
what
he
do
with
it
be
his
business
the
only
sensible
way
to
interpret
hilgard
s
aha
be
that
ging
have
hoist
hilgard
on
his
own
petard
the
latter
apparently
hop
that
the
insurance
com
panies
could
make
what
be
tantamount
to
fctional
payment
where
they
have
liability
and
then
get
their
money
back
from
the
state
while
there
be
no
direct
evidence
that
hilgard
anticipate
that
this
money
would
come
from
the
jew
his
agreement
with
the
scenario
sketch
out
by
heydrich
and
the
subsequent
remark
make
by
state
councilor
schmeer
of
the
economics
ministry
who
be
very
much
involve
in
the
reconstruction
of
the
reich
group
at
this
time
and
also
be
aware
of
the
plan
to
levy
a
billion
mark
fne
on
the
jew
could
be
interpret
as
indicative
of
hilgard
s
think
field
marshal
i
be
go
to
make
the
proposal
that
one
settle
on
a
specifc
percent
of
the
report
asset
a
billion
mark
be
to
be
collect
in
my
view
and
then
raise
this
percent
somewhat
so
that
all
the
jew
pay
the
same
amount
and
then
give
the
insur
ance
company
the
money
back
from
this
amount
ging
however
have
obviously
change
his
mind
with
respect
to
the
liability
of
the
insurance
compa
ny
at
the
begin
of
the
meeting
he
indicate
a
desire
to
relieve
them
of
all
ibid
p
ibid
obligation
but
hilgard
s
request
that
the
company
be
allow
to
fulfll
their
obligation
cause
ging
to
change
his
mind
and
to
interrupt
hilgard
before
the
latter
have
a
chance
to
clarify
his
point
no
i
be
not
think
at
all
of
giv
ing
the
money
back
to
the
insurance
company
the
insurance
company
be
liable
no
the
money
belongs
to
the
state
that
be
absolutely
clear
that
would
be
a
gift
to
the
insurance
company
they
have
make
a
generous
request
they
will
fulfll
it
you
can
count
on
it
the
question
of
interpretation
be
important
because
after
the
war
hilgard
claimed
his
aha
as
a
plus
point
in
his
denazifcation
and
he
also
give
himself
credit
for
say
presumably
in
connection
with
his
request
that
the
in
surance
company
be
permit
to
fulfll
their
obligation
that
the
insurance
company
would
even
pay
the
jew
if
they
determine
they
be
liable
he
sug
gested
that
this
require
no
small
amount
of
courage
in
the
threaten
presence
of
goebbels
and
heydrich
the
former
be
purport
by
hilgard
to
have
turn
red
and
to
have
interrupt
him
with
the
classic
word
gentleman
do
you
hear
that
i
think
the
monkey
be
pick
louse
off
me
this
man
want
to
pay
the
jew
quite
aside
from
the
fact
that
the
word
attribute
by
hilgard
to
him
self
and
to
goebbels
be
not
found
in
the
extant
portion
of
the
minute
it
be
diffcult
to
see
how
or
why
hilgard
would
have
make
a
special
point
of
say
that
the
insurance
company
would
pay
the
jew
when
it
have
be
quite
obvious
from
the
remark
make
by
ging
almost
immediately
after
hilgard
enter
the
room
that
the
jew
be
not
go
to
collect
insurance
under
any
circum
stance
goebbels
certainly
may
have
be
overwrought
give
the
way
ging
be
try
to
use
hilgard
to
make
his
position
diffcult
and
he
could
conceivably
have
misinterpret
hilgard
s
remark
or
intention
but
it
be
hard
to
imagine
the
stenographer
omit
such
a
sharp
remark
from
so
important
a
personage
yet
still
record
hilgard
s
aha
furthermore
however
threaten
a
personage
heydrich
be
positively
helpful
to
hilgard
in
suggest
precisely
what
the
lat
ter
want
namely
a
fctional
payment
by
the
insurance
company
to
help
them
save
face
that
would
then
be
compensate
it
be
the
rapacious
ging
who
elicit
hilgard
s
aha
by
reject
such
a
solution
and
declare
that
he
be
go
to
confscate
the
insurance
so
that
the
company
would
receive
no
compensation
at
all
whatever
the
defciencies
of
the
minute
about
which
hil
gard
complain
bitterly
when
they
be
fnally

the

it
be
now
suddenly
confront

so
that
all
calculation
have
to
be
thrown
out
whereas
glass

normally
collect
million
mark
in
annual

paid
out

to

at

for

no

think
anything
other
than
that
it
must

for
the

they
also
want
to
do
so
and
i
have
complete
understand
for

they
must
do
so
so
that
they
cannot
be
reproach

strong
enough
to
bear
the

glass

this
have
also
be
emphasize
be
until
now
the
best
business
it
also
have
suffcient
extra
profts
if
it
do
good
business
and
it
have
not
distribute
them
as
dividend
then
it
have
reserve
in
order
to
be
able
to
cover
the
large
damage
such
a
company
must
be
able
to
cover
damage
of
million
three
time
that
of
a
normal
year
s
premium
if
it
cannot
do
that
then
one
must
consider
whether
one
should
allow
such
small
mutual
insurance
company
to
stay
alive
it
would
simply
be
insanity
to
have
insurance
company
that
be
not
in
a
po
sition
to
cover
such
damage
such
an
insurance
company
would
absolutely
be
a
fraud
against
the
people
i
now
take
the
follow
view
the
damage
be
to
be
determine
the
insurance
company
have
to
accept
their
full
legal
liability
for
them
and
to
pay
at
this
point
there
be
a
change
of

the

that

it
would
appear
to
have
be
concerned
with

as
well
as
of

excuse
me
if
you

suddenly
an

in

some
what
corpulent

you
you

at
you
your

satisfaction
you
be
get
a

rake
off

who
have
expect
that
his

could
pas
off
the
bulk
of
the
pogrom
cost
could
not
share
this
view
as
be
his
custom
by
now
he
couched
his
argument
in
the
language
of
the
regime
to
make
a
last
desperate
point
even
at
the
risk
of
irritate
ging
it
be
a
self
evident
matter
for
me
that
the
honorable
german
merchant
ought
not
to
bear
the
burden
i
have
also
spoken
to
the
frms
and
i
have
argue
that
the
damage
ought
not
to
remain
hang
on
the
aryan
and
it
remains
hopelessly
on
the
back
of
the
aryan
because
the
insurance
community
not
the
insurance
company
be
thereby
affected
in
that
they
must
pay
high
premium
and
receive
low
dividend
as
a
result
they
be
the
one
who
be
damage
in
the
end
that
be
so
and
remains
so
no
one
will
deny
that
to
me
by
this
time
hilgard
be
as
irritate
to
ging
as
goebbels
and
ging
dis
miss
him
with
the
message
he

question

to
whether
the

need
to
be
ask
to
join
as

who
serve
as
the
legal
expert
for
the

group
and
by
hilgard
himself
they
begin
by
narrowly
defning
the
relevant
damage
under
the
two
decree
relevant
to
the
issue
the

for
the
restoration
of
the
appearance
of
the
street
and
the
atonement

implementation
decree

they
take
the
position
that
the
only
relevant
damage
be
those
that
directly
affected
the
appearance
of
the

and
involve

thus
damage

as

they
then
turn
to
the
central
question
do
liability
exist
unsur
prisingly
the
answer
be
negative
and
be
base
on
the
reich
court
decision
of
june
in
the
porto
allegre
case
in
which
an
angry
mob
respond
to
the
german
sinking
of
a
brazilian
ship
in
april
by
storm
and
destroy
var
ious
german
business
those
claim
damage
from
the
insurance
company
try
to
argue
that
they
be
entitle
to
compensation
because
the
disturbance
be
not
direct
against
the
brazilian
government
or
offcials
and
thus
do
not
qualify
as
civil
disturbance
the
court
however
rule
that
a
civil
disturbance
exist
when
portion
of
the
populace
which
do
not
have
to
be
consider
nu
merically
insignifcant
be
set
in
motion
in
a
way
that
disturbs
the
public
peace
and
order
and
exercise
violence
be
it
against
person
be
it
against
thing
in
the
view
of
the
author
this
ft
the
situation
of
november
perfectly
as
be
amply
demonstrate
in
their
view
by
goebbels
s
call
for
a
cessation
to
the
demonstration
of
november
in
which
he
urge
an
end
to
the
demonstra
tions
and
reprisal
take
against
jewry
and
jewish
property
in
justifable
and
understandable
anger
over
the
murder
of
vom
rath
from
this
goudefroy
and
hilgard
triumphantly
conclude
that
therefore
the
damage
of
november
be
the
result
of
civic
or
internal
disturbance
and
be
consequently
not
liable
to
compensation
however
the
two
insurance
executive
left
no
stone
unturned
and
go
on
to
argue
that
even
if
the
condition
defning
a
civic
disturbance
be
not
fully
sat
isfed
by
the
event
in
question
nevertheless
the
sense
of
the
general
insurance
condition
in
exclude
compensation
for
civil
disturbance
act
of
war
earth
quake
and
the
like
be
to
protect
the
insurer
from
liability
for
elementary
event
and
this
be
the
sort
of
event
goebbels
described
when
he
write
in
an
article
of
november
on
the
grspan
case
that
the
event
in
question
be
an
eruptive
outburst
of
the
anger
of
the
population
thus
if
the
pogrom
be
not
a
civil
disturbance
then
it
be
something
like
an
earthquake
goudefroy
and
hilgard
show
themselves
to
be
quite
masterful
in
carry
the
logic
of
the
pogrom
and
the
decree
arise
from
it
to
their
brutal
con
clusions
thus
aryan
owner
of
destroyed
jewish
property
could
not
suffer
damage
or
lay
claim
to
insurance
payment
because
jew
be
responsible
for
make
the
repair
they
be
most
emphatic
however
about
the
lack
of
jew
ish
entitlement
to
compensation
through
the
decree
of
november
the
entire
jewry
therefore
also
the
german
and
the
stateless
jewry
have
be
pronounce
guilty
of
the
paris
murder
and
thereby
of
a
provocation
against
the
german
people
when
the
provocateur
brings
about
the
event
provoke
then
he
must
accept
be
treat
like
the
perpetrator
himself
it
will
not
do
to
vkischer
beobachter
nov
treat
the
politically
condemn
jew
as
be
legally
guiltless
with
respect
to
insurance
as
a
consequence
it
be
justifable
to
raise
the
objection
that
the
german
and
stateless
jew
be
responsible
for
be
intentionally
or
at
the
very
least
be
grossly
negligent
in
bring
about
the
insurance
case
thereby
however
all
insurance
claim
be
render
inapplicable
it
be
not
enough
to
argue
that
the
collective
guilt
of
the
jew
for
the
murder
of
vom
rath
deprive
them
of
all
right
to
insurance
however
goudefroy
and
hilgard
found
it
necessary
to
go
far
by
insist
that
pay
the
jew
insur
ance
would
be
a
violation
of
good
moral
since
it
would
involve
payment
of
those
who
have
be
found
guilty
of
a
crime
the
act
of
reprisal
against
the
jew
have
the
character
of
a
punishment
approve
by
the
state
it
would
contradict
the
general
sense
of
justice
in
the
high
degree
if
the
german
insurance
com
panies
would
have
to
remove
this
atonement
place
upon
the
jew
yet
this
be
precisely
what
would
happen
for
example
if
one
compare
two
jew
each
with
rm
in
asset
and
damage
of
rm
but
with
only
the
second
have
insurance
then
the
former
would
pay
rm
in
damage
out
of
his
own
pocket
plus
rm
in
atonement
tax
on
his
remain
asset
whereas
the
latter
would
pay
rm
in
atonement
tax
but
nothing
for
damage
if
compensate
by
insurance
thus
the
rm
difference
would
be
cover
by
the
insurance
company
and
this
already
unsatisfactory
result
would
be
make
even
more
unbearable
if
the
money
in
question
come
from
a
mutual
insurance
enterprise
that
would
then
have
to
raise
the
money
from
its
member
for
in
this
case
the
aryan
member
of
the
enterprise
must
pay
the
punishment
impose
on
the
jew
this
memorandum
be
a
monument
to
the
sophistry
and
perversion
of
business
and
personal
ethic
that
be
come
to
characterize
businessmen
like
hilgard
and
goudefroy
in
the
pursuit
of
their
interest
under
the
condition
create
by
national
socialism
that
say
it
be
important
to
recognize
that
the
issue
be
not
one
of
pay
damage
to
jew
since
direct
insurance
payment
for
pogrom
damage
to
jew
be
manifestly
out
of
the
question
nevertheless
as
the
ex
ample
employ
at
the
end
of
the
memorandum
demonstrates
the
author
be
prepared
to
argue
that
the
liability
of
the
insurer
be
especially
undesirable
because
it
might
have
the
effect
of
relieve
the
jew
somewhat
of
the
burden
impose
on
them
by
the
decree
if
the
chief
goal
be
the
avoidance
of
insurance
payment
to
the
government
goudefroy
and
hilgard
nevertheless
do
not
shy
away
from
reinforce
their
position
by
argue
that
insurance
company
liability
would
detract
from
the
punishment
be
visit
upon
the
jew
promote
the
effcacy
of
anti
semitic
measure
be
thus
an
integral
part
of
their
argumenta
tion
against
insurance
company
liability
as
we
shall
see
this
be
not
their
last
use
of
such
argument
the
primary
goal
of
course
be
to
block
insurance
company
liability
and
hilgard
provide
the
rwm
with
detailed
information
as
to
what
the
cost
would
be
if
liability
be
to
be
assume
then
the
amount
of
money
the
government
would
collect
from
private
insurer
alone
would
amount
to
million
rm
million
in
fre

million
in
glass
insurance
and
in
transport
insurance
payment
to
foreign
jew
which
it
be
assume
would
have
to
be
make
for
political
reason
amount
to
million
rm
while
payment
to
aryan
would
amount
to
million
rm
bring
the
total
to
million
rm
for
the
private
company
alone
the
publicly
charter
company
would
owe
another
million
rm
to
jew
but
the
total
amount
of
know
but
not
yet
report
damage
to
jew
would
add
million
rm
to
the
total
and
when
one
add
damage
to
aryan
and
non
german
jew
the
total
for
the
publicly
char
tered

would
amount
to

hilgard
be
careful
to
note
that
all
the
information
still
be
not
in
and
that
many
jew
be
not
available
to
assist
in
the
determination
of
damage
although
no
mention
be
make
of
the
fact
that
their
unavailability
be
probably
due
to
their
have
be
cart
away
to

there
be
other
problem
as
well
foreign
rein
surance
company
be
refuse
payment
for
the
damage
hilgard
do
not
say
why
but
they
obviously
have
no
diffculty
call
a
civil
disturbance
by
its
name
and
that
the
fre
department
and
police
do
nothing
to
mitigate
the
damage
be
well
know
also
there
be
the
problem
of
compensate
those
who
have
suffer
accident
or
shock
and
illness
due
to
the
event
accident
and
health
in
surance
have
not
be

under
the
decree
of

whatever
the
case
time
be
of
the
essence
in
deal
with
these
question
because
non
jew

begin
to
bring
lawsuit
against
the
company
demand
payment
for
damage
finally
to
bring
home
the
implication
of
liability
hilgard
provide
a
detailed
list
from
german
and
foreign
company
demonstrate
that
often
re
port
damage
signifcantly
and
even
vastly
exceed
the
premium
they
have
collect
this
be
especially
the
case
with
small
company
for
whom
the
obligation
to
pay
would
have
proven
catastrophic
nearly
every
major
ministry

by
this
time
engage
in

to
control
the
damage
and
complication
create
by
the
pogrom

along

the
rwm

the
damage
thus
provide
an
overview
of
the
enormity
of
the
problem
by
this
time
it
be
very
clear
that
for
political
reason
certain
group
jewish
and
non
jewish
foreigner
and
non
jewish
german
citizen
would
have
to
be
com
pensated
for
the
damage
and
that
public
fund
would
have
to
be
use
for
at
least
the
immediate
handle
of
some
case
furthermore
some
property
belonging

there
be
an

of

now
completely
bankrupt
and
in
no

for

the
big
question
be
how
to
settle

quickly
avoid

trial
and

here
the

at
the
december
meeting
a
decision
be
make
to
centralize
such
decision
in
the
justice
ministry
so
as
to
ensure
uniformity
of
practice
and
maintain
budgetary
control
in
the
national
socialist
state
however
uniformity
of
decision
make
be
really
a
formula
for
discriminatory
practice
so
that
only
aryan
hardship
case
would
receive
compensation
and
it
would
be
possible
to
distinguish
between
foreign
jew
who
have
be
foreign
citizen
for
a
long
time
and
those
who
have
recently
emigrate
the
gauleiter
would
be
ask
for
advice

provide
under
the

and
non
jew
interrelate
with
jew
would
be
deny

in

as

the

of

for

arise
from
the

of

and
the
follow

such

would
be

only
on
the

of

after

however

left
open
the
question
of

that
be
whether

purely
subsidiary
or
whether

daniel
sought
to
clarify
the
matter
at
a
december
meeting
with
insurer
and
other
governmental
offcials
under
the
chairmanship
of
ministerial
direc
tor

of
the

by
this

later
turn
out

be
exaggerated

risen

million

million
rm
for
fre

million
rm
for

and
the
rest
for

the
attendee
expect
that
court
case
would
be
brought
by
foreign
insurer
claim
nonlia
bility
because
of
tumult
and
hilgard
come
well
prepared
to
argue
the
case
for
nonliability
for
german
insurer
as
well
in
the
case
of
burglary
insurance
there
be
no
liability
because
the
good
have
be
steal
after
the
window
have
be
broken
rather
than
by
those
who
have
do
the
initial
damage
as
for
the
fre
and
glass
damage
it
be
the
result
of
civic
unrest
also
the
jew
have
already
re
place
almost
all
the
glass
that
have
be
broken
as
require
by
decree
so
that
the
obligation
of
insurer
to
replace
the
glass
no
longer
exist
more
generally
and
quite
plausibly
hilgard
argue
that
he
have
never
told
ging
at
the
meet
ing
of
november
that
the
insurance
company
would
pay
in
every
case
but
only
that
the
company
would
remain
faithful
to
their
contract
and
would
pay
in
those
case
in
which
they
be
legally
bound
to
compensate
ging
s
in
terruption
and
the
subsequent
discussion
have
create
the
false
impression
that
hilgard
have
accepted
full
liability
once
again
he
and
his
colleague
reiterate
that
the
cost
be
unaffordable
the
small
mutual
glass
insurer
would
have
to
ask
their
member
for
additional
payment
that
would
exceed
by
many
time
their
normal
premium
and
even
the
large
fre
insurance
company
would
be
hard
press
as
in
the
memorandum
of

so
now
industry
represen

argue
that
payment
should
not
be
make
for
reason
of
economic
policy
namely
that
the
aryan
insured
would
not
understand

damage
include
the
jewish

without
prejudice

quite
clear
in

offcials
follow
the
departure
of

his

of

offcials
argue
that
it
be
unbearable
to
place
the
damage
cost
on
the
insurance
company
and
that
as
intend
by
the
im

of

the
cost
be
to
be
cover
by

the
problem
as
all
admit
be
that
the
decree
issue
in
the
wake
of
the

be
contradictory

confuse
it

not
the

the
appearance
of

be
intend
to
mandate
payment
by
the

and
thereby
exclude
application
of
the
civil

clause
in
policy
although
the

felt
that
the
civil

be
applicable
it
be
very
unhappy

left
the

the

in
the
view
of

of
the

the
goal
must
be
to
free
the
insurance

extract
the
contribution
without
exception
from
the
jew

it

modus
operandi
however
the

wish
to
issue

make
the

company
liable
thus
obviate
the
need
for
dis
cussions

then
actually
to
spare

need
to
pay

take
the
money
from
the

one
decide

neither

in

create

the

make

only
if

this
be

the

to
demonstrate
another

to

and
since
there

the

take
it
upon
itself

remember
back

their
confict
with
schwandt
and
the
party
in
that
we
refuse
not
to
recognize
the
riot
of
november
as
riot
in
the
end
we
push
through
with
this
position
which
be
that
held
today
because
we
saw
the
entire
action
as
a
big
schweinerei
i
still
think
back
on
the
frst
meeting
in
the
reich
economics
ministry
in
which
among
the
large
circle
present
you
and
i
be
the
only
one
who
have
the
courage
to
declare
that
this
event
be
nothing
other
than
a
tumult
although
this
be
sharply
contest
from
the
side
of
the
party
with
the
argument
that
there
could
be
no
tumult
in
the
third
reich
by
defnition
i
also
remark
that
one
would
have
to
issue
a
decree
which
would
establish
the
liability
of
the
insurer
but
which
would
have
to
begin
in
such
a
way
that
under
of
this
decree
a
tumult
be
not
a
tumult
hilgard
indeed
remember
thees
as
an
ally
as
undaunted
as
he
be
clever
write
in
hilgard
quite
unabashedly
recapture
both
his
argument
and
his
sentiment
of
the
finance
ministry
dealt
with
me
then
as
if
it
be
act
on
behalf
of
the
jew
hilgard
however
argue
that
the
insurer
have
no
responsibility
in
a
civic
commotion
and
that
since
the
reich
claimed
it
be
punish
the
jew
it
be
quite
impossible
and
in
contradiction
of
all
sense
of
justice
to
palm
this
punishment
off
on
the
insurance
institution
thus
what
i
aim
at
during
all
of
these
negotiation
be
to
prevent
that
the
reich
de

this

demonstrate
that

do
not
have
to

direct
against

but
he
warn
especially
against
the
idea
sug
gested
in
the
previous

s
discussion
that
the

could
simply
pas
a

set
aside
the

s
decision
it
would
call
forth
hilgard
warn
a
storm
of
outrage
abroad
as
evidence
he
cite
an
article
in
the
british
news
chronicle
which
report
that
many
german
insurance
company
be
face
bankruptcy
because
the
damage
to
jewish
synagogue
and
business
amount
to
over
million
pound
most
german
insurer
accord
to
the
article
car
ried
reinsurance
in
england
but
the
english
insurer
be
well
aware
that
the
german
themselves
have
eliminate
insurance
for
domestic
disturbance
from
their
policy
that
the
damage
be
do
with
the
quiet
approval
of
the
govern
ment
and
that
the
british
insurer
can
demonstrate
that
the
police
and
the
fre
department
do
not
do
their
duty
so
that
the
insurer
do
not
receive
the
mea
sure
of
offcial
protection
that
be
the
precondition
for
reinsurance
he
point
out
that
swiss
insurer
be
also
involve
and
that
it
be
not
in
the
interest
of
the
state
to
have
such
question
brought
to
trial
also
the
reinsurers
would
ex
pect
the
german
insurer
to
demand
that
the
term
of
their
own
policy
with
regard
to
civic
unrest
be
effectuate
thus
the
entire
industry
and
also
the
state
would
be
embarrass
if
liability
be
make
an
issue
while
hilgard
emphasize
the
allege
plight
of
small
insurer
he
warn
very
emphatically
in
the
name
of
the
entire
industry
against
let
the
question
hang
on
whether
or
not
the
existence
of
individual
frms
be
endanger
by
liability
for
it
be
self
evident
that
if
for
example
allianz
have
to
pay
damage
in
the
amount
of
perhaps
million
as
a
result
of
the
anti
jewish
demonstration
it
will
not
be
topple
over
but
one
must
be
clear
about
the
fact
that
every
mark
that
be
to
be
paid
for
this
by
the
german
insurance
frms
must
somehow
work
out
to
the
disadvantage
of
the
other
aryan
insured
hence
there
be
but
one
solution
namely
the
one
he
have
advocate
in
the
meeting
on
the
previous
day
that
the
amount
of
insurance
involve
be
take
from
the
jewish
contribution
about
million
mark
in
damage
have
be
report
and
by
assume
that
the
synagogue
and
other
jewish
religious
build
ings
be
not
worthy
of
reconstruction
one
be
left
with
about
million
in
damage
this
be
a
sacrifce
worth
make
to
avoid
the
very
heavy
psy
chological
damage
that
he
have
discuss
hilgard
far
propose
that
the
insurance
company
undertake
the
regulation
of
the
damage
and
then
be
paid
back
in
full
measure
he
do
not
fail
to
mention
that
the
use
of
the
insurance
apparatus
in
this
way
involve
considerable
administrative
cost
to
the
compa
ny
in
any
case
and
he
plead
with
funk
not
to
deny
the
german
insurance
business
these
fully
justifed
demand
and
to
do
everything
to
keep
catastrophic
harm
away
from
the
german
insurance
industry
kurt
schmitt
have
assign
hilgard
the
task
of
do
the
dirty
work
of
the
in
dustry
and
hilgard
be
serve
very
well
in
this
instance
however
schmitt
felt
he
have
to
intervene
himself
as
show
by
a
strictly
confdential
letter
he
sent
to
justice
minister
franz
gtner
on
december
it
be
clearly
intend
to
move
the
discussion
of
the
november
damage
up
in
the
hierarchy
of
both
the
in
dustry
and
the
government
a
privilege
schmitt
could
allow
himself
as
a
former
minister
schmitt
claimed
that
he
have
assume
that
the
decree
transfer
jew
ish
damage
claim
to
the
reich
have
be
issue
so
as
to
prevent
any
discussion
of
the
actual
and
legal
issue
related
to
this
question
now
apparently
certain
circle
in
the
government
be
actually
planning
to
call
on
the
insurance
com
panies
to
pay
schmitt
insist
that
under
the
exist
law
the
company
have
no
liability
because
of
the
civil
disturbance
involve
schmitt
make
it
clear
that
he
do
not
think
it
very
wise
to
raise
question
about
this
now
the
very
determination
as
to
whether
there
have
be
such
a
violation
of
the
public
order
or
not
be
unpleasant
but
even
if
this
be
to
be
deny
the
obligation
to
compen
sate
would
still
not
be
a
practical
issue
because
of
the
possibility
for
suit
i
can
certainly
spare
myself
go
into
detail
about
this
and
need
only
to
point
out
that
it
would
be
un
bearable
if
for
example
foreign
insurance
company
or
reinsurers
make
the
question
of
perpetration
or
the
behavior
of
the
police
and
the
fre
department
a
subject
of
court
proceeding
it
be
an
especially
unpleasant
complication
of
the
present
case
that
in
many
instance
foreign
insurance
company
be
involve
as
direct
insurer
and
reinsurers
and
accord
to
foreign
press
report
one
can
expect
that
they
would
refuse
to
pay
voluntar
ily
in
this
situation
there
be
only
one
practical
way
of
force
the
insurance
company
to
pay
namely
the
issuance
of
a
special
law
i
consider
this
idea
after
the
jew
have
in
general
already
be
obligate
to
bear
the
cost
of
the
damage
to
be
so
impossible
that
i
do
not
have
to
say
a
word
about
it
i
believe
that
a
more
unusual
and
unjust
special
tax
and
intervention
in
exist
legal
relationship
could
hardly
be
thinkable
apparently
what
be
be
do
to
the
jew
be
more
thinkable
and
the
peculiar
juxtaposition
of
the
normal
and
the
bizarre
in
the
relationship
between
the
insurance
business
and
the
government
at
this
point
be
heighten
by
the
christmas
and
new
year
wish
with
which
schmitt
end
his
letter
in
any
case
schmitt
note
that
he
be
anxious
to
bring
this
delicate
complex
of
question
to
gtner
s
attention
plan
to
call
him
about
them
and
offer
the
service
of
director
alois
alzheimer
to
the
ministry
for
far
counsel
and
discussion
the
insurance
industry
be
now
mobilize
itself
and
while
gtner
invite
alzheimer
to
take
up
discussion
with
thees
hilgard
have
a
circular
sent
on
de
cember
inform
the
industry
of
the
line
he
be
take
in
deal
with
the
government
thereby
make
the
position
that
he
and
goudefroy
have
take
the
offcial
position
of
the
industry
on
january
alzheimer
met
with
thees
schmitt
an
gtner
dez
bab
r
bl
and
other
offcials
and
reiterate
the
usual
argument
but
indicate
also
that
the
insurer
would
be
prepared
to
accept
liability
de
facto
for
aryan
and
foreigner
the
domestic
reinsurers
would
also
take
on
the
obligation
although
one
could
try
to
induce
foreign
reinsurers
to
take
a
similar
stance
court
case
have
to
be
avoid
the
bad
news
be
that
a
number
of
insurance
company
be
already
be
take
to
court
and
when
thees
ask
that
the
rjm
be
regularly
inform
of
all
such
case
alzheimer
suggest
that
they
contact
director
goudefroy
of
allianz
who
have
apparently
be
give
the
job
of
serve
as
watchdog
in
this
area
finally
on
january
hilgard
sent
a
new
memorandum
to
the
reich
economics
minister
set
forth
his
position
in
detail
and
make
concrete
pro
posals
for
a
solution
what
be
interest
about
this
late
memorandum
be
the
extent
to
which
it
give
priority
to
anti
semitic
consideration
in
make
the
case
against
insurance
company
liability
thus
because
it
would
be
count
toward
the
atonement
tax
payment
by
the
insurer
would
involve
a
shift
of
the
punishment
to
purely
german
insurance
community
it
would
weaken
the
proftability
of
german
insurer
in
favor
of
the
jew
and
contradict
the
healthy
feel
of
justice
among
all
national
comrade
to
the
high
degree
at
the
same
time
the
reich
would
receive
no
additional
money
because
the
payment
would
be
credit
to
the
con
tribution
to
be
sure
the
jew
be
also
not
entitle
to
compensation
because
of
the
civil
disturbance
involve
and
hilgard
quite
openly
state
that
there
could
be
no
legitimate
charge
against
the
company
for
make
unjustifed
saving
by
not
pay
the
damage
indeed
they
be
make
a
signifcant
sacrifce
if
they
voluntarily
compensate
the
aryan
insured
and
thereby
would
take
away
the
reich
s
obligation
to
compensate
also
the
foreign
reinsurers
would
leave
them
in
the
lurch
and
would
claim
the
right
to
go
to
court
if
they
felt
themselves
victim
of
special
legislation
that
undermined
the
basic
standard
write
into
in
surance
contract
the
long
term
effect
would
be
to
undermine
the
international
relation
of
the
industry
and
its
value
for
the
procurement
of
foreign
exchange
hilgard
saw
no
contradiction
between
his
proposal
and
the
decree
sequester
such
insurance
claim
as
may
have
exist
pick
up
on
an
argument
use
by
schmitt
he
view
the
sequestration
of
insurance
claim
as
necessary
in
order
to
take
away
from
the
jew
the
legitimacy
to
launch
complaint
and
to
bring
the
event
of
november
before
the
court
it
be
also
necessary
to
prevent
sensational
trial

hilgard
well

to
his

to
keep
the
fnal

pre

not

that
the

be
estimate
that
have
to

make
without
the
usual
help

also
that
if
the

be
basically
condemn
to

then
the
sum
of
the
damage
would
swell
extraordinarily
many
jew
be
not
in

cause
they

still

hold
back
with
their

they

not

but
if
the
compa
ny
be
basically
to
step
forward
with

these

then
substantial
retroactive

in

where
the

the

the

of

s
jew

the
jew
up
to
the
time
of
his

rather
than
of
potential

far
more
the
ministerial
offcials
have
ask
hilgard
to
report
only
such
claim
as
might
be
legally
uncontestable
there
be
some
jew

do
have

the

come

possibly
have

exclude
them
from
the

be
tantamount

deny

rather
ironic
indeed
hypocriti

in

the

short

furthermore
it
be
necessary
to
recognize
that
one
important
branch

simply
left
out

when

he

the

request
his

the

rather
for

this
present
an

the

its

rule
that
neither

it

that

the
real
tragedy

this

run

this
meant

the

in

pre

the
chief
threat
to

come
from
the
economic
diffculties
experienced

the

business
to
a
minimum
the
immediate
consequence
of
a
policyholder
cancel
a

be
that
he
or
she
lose
life
insurance
protection
but
also
no
longer
have
to
pay

the
long
term
implication
be
that
the
policyholder
and
the
insurer
have
to
forego
the
aforementioned
expectation
in
connection
with

and
profts
at
the
same
time
the
policyholder
receive
the
repurchase
value
of
the
policy
and
this
raise
the
question
of
how
that
repurchase
value
be
calculate
and
what
kind
of
loss
and
gain
if
any
the
policyholder
and
the
company
make
the
answer
be
that
the
repurchase
value
be
calculate
in
such
a
way
as
to
cover
acquisition
and
administrative
cost
already
incur
by
the
insurer
and
a
cancellation
charge
which
constitute
such
proft
be
allowable
from
the
cancellation
the
repur
chase
value
be
base
on
calculation
that
be
in
no
way
arbitrary

rather
be

the

however
the
more
they
want
to
gain
con
trol
of
jewish
asset
and
to
do
so
as
quickly
as
possible
theoretically
there
be
two
way
in
which
the
confscation
of
jewish
insurance
asset
might
have
be
of
no
cost
or
even
of
slight
proft
to
the
insurance
company
the
frst
method
would
have
be
to
postpone
confscation
until
the
insured
have
paid
off
most
of
the
acquisition
cost
equally
distribute
over
the
life
of
the
policy
then
the
cancellation
charge
would
meet
both
the
cancellation
cost
and
those
acquisition
cost
not
paid
off
at
this
point
it
be
obvious
that
the
regime
want
the
money
quickly
and
be
not
go
to
pace
its
confscations
to
suit
insurance
company
calculation
the
second
method
would
have
be
for
the
government
actually
to
assume
the
title
to
policy
and
wait
until
they
come
to
term
i
have
found
no
evidence
in
the
period
prior
to
that
insurance
company
offcials
ever
suggest
such
a
thing
or
that
those
in
the
national
socialist
regime
ever
contemplate
or
indicate
any
interest
in
confscating
insurance
policy
per
se
pay
premium
and
patiently
await
the
day
when
it
could
collect
the
full
sum
to
which
its
jewish
victim
would
have
be
entitle
such
an
arrange
ment
would
undoubtedly
have
serve
the
interest
of
the
insurance
company
furthermore
neither
before
nor
after
be
the
welfare
of
the
insurance
com
panies
with
respect
to
jewish
life
insurance
asset
a
national
socialist
priority
hence
from
the
regime
s
perspective
the
central
problem
be
to
create
circum
stance
in
which
the
jew
or
the
company
be
compel
to
monetize
these
insurance
asset
and
to
then

to

the
cost
of

imposi

by

if
one
wish
to
understand
what
happen
to
jewish

asset
then
it
be
a
mistake
to
concentrate
attention
on
the
problem
of
unclaimed
insur
ance

since
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
national
socialist
be
to
make
sure
that
there
be
no
unclaimed
policy
the
record
before
suggests
that
in
germany
and
the
area
annexed
to

the
national

be
highly

insurance

in
one
form
or
another
what
should
be
obvious
from
the
forego
description
be
that
the
national

government
not
the
insurance

beneftted
from
the
confscation
of
such

that
it

not
the

that

the

the
reality
be
that
confscation

be
a
realm
in
which
the

nothing

thus
do
so
at
the
very
least
because
it
be
in
their

even
though
the
industry
and
its
leader
in
creasingly
adapt
to
the
demand
of
the

out
of
self
interest
and
thereby
become
increasingly
implicate
in
its
misdeed
there
be
nevertheless
point
at
which
the
interest
of
the
regime
be
simply
incompatible
with
those
of
the
insurance
industry
one
of
these
be
the
transformation
of
life
insurance
poli
cies
from
policy
on
which
premium
be
regularly
paid
to

the

not
a

of
resistance
on
the
part
of
the
in
surance
company
to
measure
of
the
regime
but
rather
of
an
ultimately
futile
self
interested
effort
though
not
without
some
evidence
of
humane
concern
in

to

recognize
even
where

anything
but
friendly
toward

as
be
the
case
with
the

insurance
company
of
halle
hostility

within
the

and
jewish

be
a
favorite
target
of
anti

in
the

at
large
unsurprisingly
then
they
be
already
the
target
of
special

aim
at

their
eco
nomic
existence
especially
in
connection
with
the

soon
after
the

take

be

out
in

boy
cott
at
the

of
march

as
one
of
the
company
s
offcials
note
this
present
some
unpleasant
problem
the
consequence
of
the
present
political
movement
in
germany
for
the
lawyer
insured
by
us
especially
the
jewish
lawyer
cannot
be
predict
with
any
certainty
i
do
not
know
how
many
jewish
lawyer
be
insured
by
us
and
also
do
not
know
for
how
much
they
be
insured
since
in
general
the
jew
be
not
exactly
lax
when
it
come
to
the
care
of
his
family
i
must
assume
that
the
number
of
jewish
lawyer
insured
by
us
and
also
the
amount
of
the
insurance
corresponds
approximately
to
the
number
of
jewish
lawyer
in
the
bar
i
must
therefore
assume
that
a
substantial
portion
of
the
rm
in
premium
payment
due
on
april
will
not
come
in
because
the
gentleman
will
probably
hold
back
their
cash
for
the
time
be
due
to
the
intransparency
of
their
own
situation
i
must
also
calculate
that
despite
the
most
urgent
advice
against
do
so
on
our
part
in
each
in
dividual
case
a
large
number
of
the
gentleman
in
order
to
have
cash
on
hand
will
not
only
prematurely
transform
their
insurance
into
premium
free
policy
but
will
also
even
buy
back
their
life
insurance
or
at
a
minimum
ask
for
a
prepayment
the
sum
of
such
de
mands
make
upon
us
cannot
for
the
moment
be
in
any
way
calculate
where
before
i
could
view
an
average
liquidity
in
the
amount
of
rm
as
completely
suffcient
i
must
for
the
forseeable
future
count
on
the
necessity
of
raise
this
to
a
million
rm
however
when
calculation
be
make
by
another
offcial
of
the
company
later
in
april
the
situation
appear
less
gloomy
with
an
anticipate
loss
of
only
indeed
as
the
offcial
in
question
cynically
note
loss
might
be
turn
into
opportunity
on
the
other
hand
we
cannot
tell
today
whether
or
not
the
income
of
other
lawyer
would
not
rise
through
the
loss
of
a
large
number
of
jewish
lawyer
in
such
a
way
that
once
a
certain
equilibrium
be
attain
the
former
will
be
able
to
make
large
payment
for
their
insurance
than
before
we
must
assume
that
this
momentary
loss
will
be
thereby
balance
out
over
time
one
of
the
way
this
organization
sought
to
protect
itself
in
the
meantime
be
to
take
a
tough
position
whenever
it
could
manage
not
to
accommodate
its
jewish
customer
thus
it
pursue
a
policy
of
refuse
to
allow
buy
back
by
person
affected
by
the
law
on
the
cleanse
of
the
civil

insofar
as
the
policy
be
held
for
too
short
a
time
or
do
not
qualify
for
some
other
rea
son
when
it
come
to
pension
however
the
organization
abandon
such
legal
nicety
for
instance
when
a
jewish
lawyer
who
have
purchase
a
pension
but
could
no
longer
be
a

of
the

we
leave
it
up
to
you
to
take

we
would
like
to
see
the
german
court
that
would
fnd
against
us
in

of
a

on
to
them
a
measure
of
the
value
place
on
their
business
albeit
a
some
what
bizarre
one
in
hindsight
can
be
see
in
the
response
of
allianz
to
the
frst
wave
of
jewish
emigration
during
the
early
year
of
the
national
socialist
regime
thus
in
february
one
of
allianz
s
daughter
company
the
wil
helma
in
magdeburg
sent
a
circular
to
its

that
read
as
be
know
the
swiss
national
insurance
company
in
basel
be
connect
to
our
com
pany
it
be
therefore
to
our
interest
that
our
policyholder
who
move
to
switzerland
become
customer
of
the
swiss
national
if
you
hear
about
the
emigration
of
a
policy
holder
to
switzerland
we
should
be
inform
about
this
as
quickly
as
possible
so
that
we
can
recommend
that
the
customer
take
out
a
policy
with
swiss
national
we
reiter
ate
that
this
information
should
be
provide
as
quickly
as
possible
if
it
transpires
a
few
month
after
the
move
have
take
place
then
it
will
not
seldom
be
the
case
that
the
policy
holder
will
already
have
conclude
a
new
policy
with
another
company
allianz
however
also
have
its

emigrate

we
also
would
like
to
bind
them
to
us
in
their
new
homeland
it
be
there
fore
necessary
that
we
receive
report
of
such
case
as
speedily
as
possible
so
that
we
can
report
the
move
to
the
international
section
of
the
company
in
berlin
while
it
be
interest
to
note
that
one
of
the
signer
of
this
circular
be
the
jewish
director
eichbaum
who
end
up
work
for
allianz
in
the
safety
of
jo
hannesburg
south

it
should
be
clear
that
this
be
general
allianz
policy
in
the
period
before
radicalization
of
the

set
in

a

would
have
be
inconceivable
two

later

it

well
al
lianz

its

abroad
manage
to

it

over
the
last

when
the

it
be
extremely
important
to
recognize
that

jew
be
not
subject
to
special
identifcation
and
while
some

many
do
not
rosenberg
for

as
the
personage
of
nazi
ideologue
alfred
rosenberg
demonstrates
need
not
be
a
jewish
name
the
regime
try
to
solve
this
problem
of
identifcation
by
decree
on
august
that
every
jew
have
to
have
a
clearly
recognizable
jewish
give
name
or
to
take
on
the
mid
dle
name
of
israel
or
sarah
by
january
but
this
be
not
evidence
in
insurance
policy
document
unless
there
be
correspondence
after
that
date
in
which
the
policyholder
specifcally
use
the
name
also
jew
who
have
already
emigrate
be
not
cover
by
this

thus
the
identifcation
of
jewish
policyholder
be
possible
only
if
the
policy
contain
some
other
evidence
for
example
correspondence
indicate
an
intention

which

aim
at

qualitative
evidence
in
the
form
of

between
the

and
its
jewish
customer
give
me
every
reason
to
have
confdence
in
the
conclusion
drawn
by
the
arthur
andersen
investigator
with
respect
to
the
character
and
fate
of
the
policy
these
conclusion
will
be
discuss
next
finally
it
be
important
to
note
that
most
insurance
policy
be
rather
matter
of
fact
document
contain
little
or
no
correspondence
as
note
before
the
only
way
one
can
identify
many
of
those
belonging
to
jew
be
because
they
contain
form
and
calculation
require
by
postwar
restitution
authority
a
few
insur
ance
policy
however
include
reveal
and
at
time
move
correspondence
that
give
us
some
sense
of
the
trial
and
suffering
of
these
jewish
policyholder
first
however
let
us
consider
the
statistical
record
provide
by
arthur
an
dersen
which
select
and
systematically
examine
some
policy
and
then
randomly
chose
another
out
of
a
total
of
fles
thus
a
to
tal
of
fles
be
examine
of
these
be
believe
to
be
policy
own
by
jew
most
of
the
person
in
question
be
businessmen
lawyer
and

medical
doctor
or
other
professional
jew
constitute
ofthe
german
population
under
the
racial
law
of
and
only
insofar
as
they
self
identifed
as
jew
and
it
be
diffcult
to
say
whether
as
a
group
they
be
more
or
less
inclined
to
take
out
life
insurance
than
others
the
austrian
evidence
suggests
not
however
the
amount
for
which
jew
insured
themselves
would
appear
to
have
be
high
than
average
thus
where
the
average
large
life
insurance
policy
at
allianz
leben
which
have
only
be
found
in
be
rm
in
and
the
average
small
life

be
for
rm
the
correspond
sum
for
the
jew
identifed
in
the
andersen
sample
be
rm
and
rm
respectively
needle
to
say
the

of
these

which
be

when
it

and
the
take
out
after
come
from
the
acquisition
of
other
compa
ny
and
their
old
stock
this
explains
why
the
number
of
jewish
own
policy
grow
slightly
during
the
early
year
of
the
national

and
do
not
diminish
as
dramatically
as

otherwise

the

in
thus
the
number

demonstrate
the
number
of

far
outweigh
the
number
of

with
the
latter
most
preponderant
in
the
early
year
of
the
regime
and
in
conversion
of
course
involve
a
signifcant
diminution
of
cash
value
but
it
be
a
way
of
hold
on
to
the
policy
without
the
burden
of

in
many
case
however
conversion
be
a
prelude
to
cancellation
manifestly
cancellation
reduce
the
life
of
the

in
the
case
of
the
large
life
policy
by
an
average
of
half
i

from

and
this
meant
that
the
cash
value
on
average
be
reduce
to
almost
of
the
sum
insured
finally
it
be
useful
once
again
to
consider
who
initiate

by

hence
what
emerges
from
these
fgures
be
that
most
policy
be
cancel
by
policyholder
themselves
and
that
insofar
as
proceeds
from
the
re
purchase
of

policy
be
then
confscated
as
most
of
them
indeed
be
in
one
way
or
another
the
confscation
be
indirect
in
that
it
take
place
after
the
cancellation
only
after
do
direct
confscation
of
insurance
pol
icy
proceeds
by
government
agency
predominate
even
if
the
record
show
that
allianz
and
its
allied
company
paid
off
their
jewish
customer
and
follow
their
instruction
about
disposition
of
their
in
surance
asset
this
do
not
mean
that
the
policyholder
could
freely
dispose
of
the
money
they
receive
or
indeed
that
they
have
not
act
under
constraint
when
they
transform
or
cancel
their
policy
to
be
sure
there
be
rare
case
like
that
of
a
frankfurt
lawyer
who
read
the
handwrite
on
the
wall
early
in
the
game
as
he
later
report
in
claim
compensation
after
in
march
i
be
arrest
by
the
nazi
twice
i
saw
the
disaster
come
and
make
plan
to
fee
naturally
i
want
to
have
as
much
cash
as
possible
when
fee
between
the
frst
and
the
second
arrest
that
be
in
march
i
therefore
go
to
the
favag
and
declare
that
i
want
to
buy
back
my
insurance
the
favag
offcial
told
me
that
i
should
think
long
and
hard
about
the
matter
since
i
would
lose
a
crazy
amount
of
money
i
explain
my
situation
and
bought
the
insurance
back
he
manage
to
get
the
money
out
and
change
his
mark
into
franc
in
saar
brken
this
however
be
early
in
the
regime
later
on
when
jew
cancel
their
policy
and
receive
their
money
there
be
little
mystery
as
to
why
they
be
do
so
sometimes
as
in
the
case
of
a
merchant
from
wzburg
in
november
the
simple
fact
be
make
explicit
now
that
i
do
not
have
any
far
mean
of
existence
for
myself
and
for
my
family
and
need
cash
for
living
i
here
with
cancel
my
life
insurance
policy
with
you
and
ask
for
its
repurchase
value
in
many
case
however
the
disposition
of
monies
derive
from
life
insurance
asset
be
far
more
complicate
and
be
to
increase
in
complexity
insofar
as
jew
intend
to
emigrate
their
asset
be
subject
to
the
reich
flight
tax
of
a
measure
institute
at
the
highpoint
of
the
depression
and
whichtherefore
antedate
the
national
socialist
regime
it
be
intend
to
discourage
german
from
leave
the
country
and
take
their
capital
with
them
the
national
so
cialists
who
wish
the
jew
to
emigrate
but
also
wish
to
seize
their
asset
transform
the
tax
into
a
mechanism
for
despoil
the
jew
thus
where
the
original
law
provide
that
all
person
have
a
yearly
income
of
rm
or
taxable
asset
of
rm
have
to
pay
of
their
asset
upon
emigration
the
change
law
of
may
provide
that
those
earn
over
rm
a
year
or
have
asset
worth
rm
be
require
to
pay
of
their
net
worth
as
a
tax
if
they
wish
to
emigrate
this
substantial
reduction
in
the
thresh
old
amount
of
asset
liable
to
taxation
and
the
inclusion
of
asset
like
reich
railroad
bond
which
have
previously
be
exempt
from
consideration
be
clearly
aim
at
the
jew
the

law

design
to
force
them
in
the

rapacious
finance
ministry
to
make
a

large

the
future
the

have
plan
to
wait
until

in

policy
and
thus
beneft
from
the
interest
he
would

the
event
at

make

he
write

follow
i
herewith
exercise
my

right
and
sincerely
request
that
you
do
not
wait
until
february
to
make
payment
but
rather
undertake
payment
immedi
ately
if
necessary
by
calculate
back
interest
since
the
payment
be
urgently
need
for
purpose
of
pay
the
reich
flight
tax
in
view
of
my
many
year
as
one
of
your
policy
holder
and
your
know
fairness
i
can
certainly
assume
that
you
will
fulfll
my
request
in
the
case
of
allianz
and
its
associate
company
there
be
no
need
for
such
anxiety
the
customer
s
request
be
fulflled
when
rm
be
place
as
request
in
the
block
account
under
the
control
of
the
president
of
the
rev
enue
offce
in
silesia
at
this
point
of
course
allianz
have
paid
off
the
policy
the
real
problem
be
that
the
right
of
the
owner
of
such
account
to
dispose
of
the
asset
contain
in
them
be
subject
to
the
permission
of
the
revenue
au
thority
and
release
of
the
fund
of
which
the
insurance
payment
be
usually
only
a
part
depend
upon
satisfaction
of
the
reich
flight
tax
requirement
as
well
as
other
tax
obligation
thus
what
be
confscated
be
not
the
insurance
asset
but
the
money
derive
from
it
the
anxiety
that
be
somewhat
mute
in
the
last
discuss
case
be
often
make
very
explicit
in
others
for
instance
a
berlin
lawyer
held
two
year
poli
cies
take
out
in
with
a
face
value
of
rm
the
repurchase
value
of
one
of
the
policy
have
already
be
seize
by
the
authority
to
cover
liability
and
he
write
to
allianz
on
november
about
his
second
policy
i
sincerely
request
the
immediate
reporting
of
the
repurchase
value
as
of
november
the
matter
be
very
press
since
i
must
already
report
the
repurchase
value
on
early
tuesday
morning
i
would
be
very
grateful
if
the
matter
could
be
take
care
of
with
the
great
possible
speed
and
as
an
urgent
matter
and
if
you
could
give
me
the
informa
tion
by
telephone
the
cost
can
be
charge
to
me
for
whatever
reason
allianz
be
not
able
to
provide
the
information
until
the
late
afternoon
of
november
but
by
this
time
the
revenue
offce
have
place
a
azlb
f
azlb
f
lien
against
the
policy
which
be
fnally
lift
in
february
after
the
policy
holder
have
use
other
resource
as
security
for
payment
of
the
atonement
levy
in
the
process
he
have
turn
the
policy
into
a
paid
up
one
and
be
able
to
buy
it
back
for
rm
in
february
one
of
the
more
depress
aspect
of
the
correspondence
between
allianz
and
its
policyholder
be
the
witting
or
unwitting
race
against
time
and
circumstance
to
which
it
bore
witness
a
good
illustration
be
a
year
old
berlin
lawyer
with
a
rm
policy
that
he
have
take
out
in
on
october
he
write
to
allianz
point
out
that
his
biannual
premium
be
due
on
november
however
all
jewish
lawyer
be
lose
their
license
effective
november
and
whether
he
would
be
allow
to
practice
as
a
consultant
i
e
a
specialist
in
handle
the
legal
problem
of
jew
be
doubtful
if
he
could
not
be
license
then
he
would
probably
have
to
buy
back
his
policy
since
he
need
the
inter
est
it
have
accrue
and
he
want
to
know
what
the
difference
in
the
repurchase
value
of
his
policy
would
be
if
he
paid
the
november
premium
or
if
he
wait
until
january
and
then
bought
back
the
policy
that
be
would
he
lose
money
by
pay
the
premium
and
then
cancel
at
the
begin
of
the
year
when
he
would
know
for
sure
about
his
appointment
as
a
consultant
allianz
respond
to
him
almost
immediately
frst
misunderstand
his
question
but
then
answer
it
once
he
have
clarifed
matter
by
the
begin
of
december
however
the
question
have
become
irrelevant
and
the
policyholder
ask
for
the
repurchase
value
of
his
policy
to
be
paid
to
a
block
account
at
the
commerz
und
privatbank
since
i
need
the
money
for
the
levy
on
jewish
asset
here
obviously
the
insurer
be
in
no
position
to
help
the
customer
beyond
pay
out
promptly
but
it
be
worth
note
that
the
company
do
seem
to
strive
to
explain
its
regulation
to
jewish
customer
and
to
bend
the
regulation
when
it
seem
possible
to
show
a
modicum
of
decency
this
be
well
illustrate
by
the
case
of
a
jewish
merchant
from
lehrensteinsfeld
who
turn
his
policy
into
a
paid
up
policy
in
when
he
could
no
longer
afford
the
premium
when
he
discover
that
the
value
of
the
policy
be
now
reduce
below
the
total
sum
of
the
premium
paid
however
he
be
quite
shock
and
complain
to
his
agent
the
latter
point
out
that
the
premium
be
calculate
in
such
a
way
that
risk
of
early
death
have
to
be
take
into
account
as
well
as
other
cost
connect
with
acquire
customer
and
that
these
weigh
more
heavily
the
earlier
the
cu
tomer
decide
to
stop
pay
premium
the
policyholder
in
question
remain
upset
however
and
allianz
make
a
point
of
send
him
a

their

on

by

at
this

the

who
be

decide
to

clearly
he

the

certainly
give
him
good
reason

have

the

also
played
a

especially
because

change
that
take

in

create
a

as
a

not

the

but
also
the
foreign

become
subject
to
instruction
from
the
more
ruthless
and
fanatically
anti
semitic
ele
ments
in
the

one
of
the
concrete
consequence
of
this
change
be
a
decision
take
at
the
end
of
that
allow
the
foreign

agency
to
take
control
of
the
disposition
of

of
anyone
suspect

and
this
come
to
mean
all
jew
planning

despite
the
friction
this
create
between
the
finance
ministry
and
the
s
these
change
prove
to
be
an
important
administrative
bridge
between
the
indirect
and
direct
confscation
of
insurance
and
other
asset
from
block
account
what
be
miss
how
ever
be
an
informational
bridge
and
this
be
create
by
the
decree
of
april
on
the
reporting
of
jewish
asset
which
require
all
jew
with
over
rm
in
asset
to
give
a
full
and
complete
statement
of
their
holding
by
category
and
worth
as
of
the
date
of
the
decree
and
to
update
it
yearly
the
head
of
the
four
year
plan
be
empower
to
take
measure
that
be
necessary
to
secure
the
mobilization
of
the
asset
subject
to
reporting
for
the
beneft
of
the
german
economy
this
meant
that
the
nazi
authority
would
now
have
a
list
of
a
large
proportion
of
the
policy
and
policy
number
own
by
jew
that
be
provide
by
the
jew
themselves
thus
a
substantial
amount
of
administra
tive
and
informational
machinery
be
in
place
prior
to
the
pogrom
of
november
and
naturally
this
facilitate
the
confscation
of
jewish
asset
in
the
case
of
insurance
most
confscation
remain
indirect
that
be
it
be
subsequent
to
monetization
of
the
policy
by
early
the
process
of
indirect
confsca
tion
be
become
barely
distinguishable
from
those
of
direct
confscation
whether
direct
or
indirect
however
one
must
emphasize
the
importance
of
monetization
in
the
confscation
of
insurance
asset
since
their
value
be
base
on
the
payment
of
premium
and
since
both
the
face
value
and
the
dividend
depend
on
collection
by
the
insured
or
on
his
or
her
behalf
this
make
insurance
policy
different
from
security
which
the
reich
finance
ministry
permit
to
be
use
as
payment
where
cash
be
not
available
to
pay
the
reich
flight
tax
installment
on
the
atonement
tax
or
fee
necessary
for
emigration
in
such
instance
security
be
deposit
to
the
account
of
the
prussian
state
bank
know
as
the
seehandlung
dividend
could
then
be
paid
into
these
ac
count
and
the
share
could
also
be
market
if
the
government
chose
to
do
so
an
examination
of
or
of
the
allianz
share
issue
before
and
during
for
example
reveals
that
some
be
forcibly

to
the
seehandlung
between
and
in
in
in
in
and
in
the
evidence
from
this
source
indicates
that
about
of
allianz
s
share
be
held
by
jew
these
share
be
deposit
to
the
account
of
the
seehandlung
at
the
shareholder
s
bank
and
allianz
paid
dividend
to
the
account
and
apparently
continued
to
correspond
with
the
original
shareholder
insofar
as
they
could
be
locate
in
for
example
allianz

would

true
for

wise
there

there

the

the
swiss

no
right
to
turn

ironically
ameri
can

reject
such
argument
they
point
out
that

that

ultimately

similar
solution
for
the
insurance
industry
namely
periodically
suspend
the
legal
penalty
for
not
meeting
the
deadline
without
change
the
deadline
itself
at
the
same
time
the
raa
use
its
vir
tually
dictatorial
power
under
section
of
the
reich
insurance
law
as
revise
in
agree
to
regulate
the
legal
status
of
the
policy
in
way
favorable
to
the
reich
the
insurance
company
also
intend
to
be
as
accommodate
as
possible
to
the
reich
thus
while
have
the
right
to
deduct
insurance
premi
ums
due
from
the
repurchase
price
they
automatically
set
december
as
the
date
on
which
all
policy
fall
under
the
th
decree
be
offcially
ter
minated
in
other
word
discovery
of
policy
after
that
date
would
not
lead
to
far
deduction
of
premium
furthermore
the
insurance
company
agree
to
pay
a
repurchase
price
on
annuity
and
pension
even
though
they
do
not
carry
repurchase
provision
at
a
meeting
between
representative
of
the
raa
the
finance
ministry
and
the
insurance
industry
on
may
the
raa
be
able
to
report
a
half
year
suspension
of
the
penalty
for
noncompliance
they
also
inform
insurer
that
the
reich
would
continue
the
property
liability
and
other
form
of
insur
ance
on
property
take
from
jew
under
the
th
decree
until
disposition
of
the
property
be
determine
no
one
of
course
object
to
continued
col
lection
of
premium
but
the
company
do
complain
that
half
a
year
be
not
enough
time
to
comb
through
the
policy
especially
those
that
be
paid
up
and
contain
little
tell
tale
correspondence
btcher
suggest
that
the
com
panies
report
to
him
on
their
progress
shortly
before
the
next
deadline
come
up
and
he
would
then
show
consideration
for
justifed
petition
for
exemption
from
penalty
the
most
important
thing
be
that
individual
company
can
demon
strate
at
any
time
that
they
have
not
violate
their
obligation
to
do
their
duty
a
particularly
grotesque
aspect
of
the
situation
be
that
the
reich
after
all
have
in
a
certain
sense
replace
the
jewish
policyholder
as
a
customer
itself
this
be
come
clear
when
it
be
point
out
that
the
reich
do
not
have
to
take
advantage
of
the
general
cancellation
date
of
december
but
could
opt
instead
to
continue
pay
premium
on
the
policy
if
this
seem
advantageous
as
might
indeed
be
the
case
with
a
policy
near
its
term
the
company
agree
to
pay
interest
on
the
repurchase
value
they
held
until
surrender
effective
january
in
the

still

as

the

that

the

btcher
s
offce

under

the

any
thing
to

with
resistance
or
sympathy
for

be
dispossess
so
much
as
the
sheer
absurdity
of
be
ask
to

under
such
condition
and
for
such
purpose
where
the
task
be
easy
however
it

thus
on
may

the
re

and
also
of

involve
in

so
what
kind
of
evidence
do
allianz
s
collection
of
insurance

provide
with
respect
to
implementation
of

the
frst
point

most
of

account
that
have
to

not
the

a
second
point

that
the

often
remain
in

of

the

paid

the

allianz
then
paid

the
signifcant
point
be
that

obviously
jewish

because
of
its
conversion
at
the
end
of

nevertheless
be
not
found

rather
it
be
cashed
in
at
the
demand
of
the
revenue
offce
mat
ters
go
much
more
smoothly
in
the
case
of
deport
jew
since
there
be
a
procedure
in
place
involve
fairly
rapid
acquisition
of
the
monies
collect
from

for
example
samuel
and
nora
hellmann
of

before
their
deportation
be
force
to
sign
over
their
life
insurance
policy
with
berli
nische
lebensversicherungs

and
two
other
life
insurance
policy
to
the
bavarian
district
offce
of
the
reich
association
of
jew
in
germany
as
be
so
often
the
case
once
the
war
start
jewish
organization
be
use
to
collect
the
asset
of
the
deport
thus
make
confscation
easy
and
more
effcient
within
two
week
after
their
departure
for
theresienstadt
at
the
end
of
july
the
money
from
the
repurchase
have
be
collect
a
total
of
rm
more
than
enough
to
cover
the
home
purchase
contract
of
rm
for
their
domicile
in
theresienstadt
it
be
a
measure
of
the
bureaucratic
scrupulousness
of
berlinische
lebensversicherungsgesellschaft
that
the
company
have
insist
on
gestapo
permission
before
turn
the
money
over
to
the
reich
association
a
third
point
be
that
there
be
often
a
considerable
time
gap
between
the
be
suance
of
the
decree
and
the
identifcation
and
transfer
of
insurance
asset
a
good
illustration
be
a
jewish
businessman
from
baden
who
write
to
allianz
in
april
ask
advice
about
change
his
year
gm
policy
take
out
in
into
a
paid

so
that
later
when
the
time
of
my
emigration
come
into
prospect
to
consider
possibly
repurchase
it
allianz
respond
within
ten
day
and
urge
him
to
maintain
the
policy
in
force
if
possible
in
late
january
they
sent
him
another
letter
urge
him
to
pay
his
premium
and
in
february
allianz
try
to
locate
him
through
the
resident
regis

only
to
discover
that
he
and
his
family
be

october
nevertheless
allianz
go
through
all
the
formality
connect
with
the

write
to
his
old
address
in
march
ask
for
payment
of
his
premium
plus
interest
and
then
send
the
stan
dard
form
letter
on
april
cancel
the
policy
and
subsequently
transform
it
into
a

worth
rm
to
be
paid
either
on
the
death
of
the

on
april

the

his
wife
be
kill

say
this
would
not

matter
at
all
give
the

it
contain

demonstrate
that

on
november
once
again
there
be
no
reason
to
construe
the
leisurely
pace
of
these
expropri
ations
as
resistance
the
available
evidence
suggests
that
allianz
employee
duly
report
jewish
policy
qualify
under
the
th
decree
as
they
found
them
moreover
the
revenue
offces
do
not
always
proceed
with
alacrity
so
that
month
would
sometimes
pas
between
reporting
to
berlin
brandenburg
and
collection
by
the
regional
revenue
offce
what
be
unsettle
be
the
matter
of
fact
quality
to
the
entire

and
the
sense
one
have
of
a
brutal
depersonaliza
tion
of
the
life
insurance
business
the
inclination
to
treat
the
nazi
state
as
some
kind
of
natural
successor
to
the
former
jewish
policyholder
this
be
exemplifed
not
only
by
the
discussion
in
the
raa
and
rfm
about
perpetuate
certain
policy
in
order
to
maximize
their
return
to
the
government
which
also
meant
maximize
their
return
to
the
company
but
in
more
concrete
way
too
this
can
be
see
in
the
case
of
a
year
old

the

it

important
to

that
the

this

direct
in

also
because
the

great
it

argue
that
one
could
also

such
an
interpretation
be
all
the
more
necessary
because

do
not
have
the

that
the

often

the

who
have
distinguish
himself

civil

in
the
service
of
the

he
do
not
think
the
issue
fell
under
the
decree
exclude
jew
from
economic
life
but
he
also
do
not
think
that
a
special
law
be
necessary
the
desire
goal
could
be
attain
instead
by
measure
of
the
raa
if
one
accepted
the
proposition
as
schlegelberger
obviously
do
that
jew
be
the
bad
possible
risk
then
the
distinction
between
mutuals
and
corpus
tions
be
irrelevant
since
both
be
community
of
risk
and
thus
be
entitle
to
protect
themselves
they
could
do
so
by
agree
not
to
insure
jew
and
by
terminate
the
policy
of

insofar
as
their

allow
this
where
the
statute
do
not
allow

however
the
raa
could
step
in
and
require
that
jew
as
especially
severe
risk
be
require
to

at
the

time
the
exclusion

that

it

and
the

so

indeed

because
daf

it
would
be
a
mistake
to

that

opportunism

in

pure
that
be
totally
cynical
and
hypocritical
and
that

completely
artifcial
and
unnatural

that
it

munich

drop
from
to
the
reality

that

take
on
entirely
different
dimension
from

munich
re
s
profts
have
also
risen
dramatically
so
that
there
be
ground
to
question
whether
it

much
to

re

munich
re
may
have
found
and
dominate
allianz
for
a
substantial
period
but
the
day
of
junior
partnership
be
long
past
and
the
continued
dependence
express
in
the
contract
provision
on
reinsurance
be
prove
bothersome
it
be
time
schmitt
told
the
munich
re
supervisory
board
at
a
meeting
on
april
to
revise
the
contract
everyone
of
course
recognize
that
munich
re
could
stand
on
its
own
right
and
could
morally
justify
such
a
course
by
its
past
and
continue
contribu
tions
to
allianz
s
success
in
schmitt
s
view
however
such
a
posture
make
little
practical
sense
it
would
produce
an
atmosphere
of
tension
that
would
increase
over
time
and
undermine
the
relationship
which
be
to
be
formally
up
for
renewal
in
but
which
obviously
could
not
be
thought
of
in
such
formal
term
at
the
same
time
it
would
be
diffcult
if
not
impossible
for
munich
re
to
secure
its
stance
by
gain
suffcient
control
of
allianz
s
cap
ital
share
most
importantly
however
this
seem
to
be
the
time
to
settle
the
difference
between
the
two
concern
and
to
found
their
future
relation
ship
not
only
on
hold
one
another
s
share
and
business
arrangement
but
above
all
on
mutual
friendship
and
trust
it
be
essential
that
the
young
generation
feel
the
carry
on
of
their
common
endeavor
to
be
a
personal
obligation
the
situation
be
probably
more
diffcult
than
schmitt
be
indicate
im
portant
evidence
for
such
tension
be
that
allianz
be
much
concerned
about
a
potential
effort
by
munich
re
to
control
its
share
this
be
reveal
when
al
lianz
begin
to
liquidate
its
real

under
raa
pressure
that
it
hold

its

the
one
exception

which
allianz
actually
plan
to
transfer
a

in
before
this
met
with
objection
from
the
raa
allianz
representative
respond
that
the
concern
need
to
keep
freia
alive
since
as
they
confess
its
real
pur
pose
be
to
administer
a
large
block
of
allianz
share
director
ernst

justifed
this
by
point
out
that

must
unconditionally
prevent
that
far

be
bought
up
by
the

because
it
would
then
get

allianz
do
not
want
to
place
itself
completely
in
the
hand
of
the
munich
re
the
sale
of
the
share
on
the
stock
market
exchange
be
impossible
because
there
be
no

mr
a

ibid

at
the
present
time
even

would
therefore
lead
to
a
drop
in
the
quotation
this
argument
lead
the
raa
to
relent
in
its
pressure
although
it
expect
allianz
to
dissolve
the
freia
company
eventually
allianz
however
continued
to
hold
the
company
throughout
the
war
the
signifcance
of
this
silent
control
of
its
own

through

may
be
measure
by

feel
in
the
industry
at
the
time
of
allianz
s
major
acquisition
the
basic
re
lationship
be
hardly
a
secret
since
everyone
knew
that
they
be
shareholder
in
one
another
s
corporation
and
that
they
have
supervisory
board
member
in

nevertheless
in
january
it
be
thought
wise
to
supplement
sec
tion
with
a
clause
that
in
the
interest
of
munich
re

other
business
relation
the
acquisition
of
more

be
to

treat
con

with

not
in

the

clearly

the
disadvan

both
side
and
this
be
to
be
all
the
more
the
case
when
germany
be

abroad
while
wartime
obviously
reduce
business
with
germany
s
enemy
foreign
business

increase

thus
in
january
another
change
be
make
under
which
the

also
have
to
offer

abroad
for

which
perhaps
should
have
to
be
disguise
for
political
reason
what
these
arrangement
also
make
clear
be
that
the
historian
of

must
not
neglect
the
history

role
of

it

more

thus

that
be
in

it
be
not
without

the
general

come
from
the
middle

of

be
correct

this

impossible
and
because
of
the

there
be
a

argue
on

in
a
meeting
of

advisory
council
that
those
company
which
have
an
austrian

in

be
able
thereby
to

exclude

hilgard
agree
with
ullrich

he
also
point
out
that

want
also

that
the

immediately
go
over

he
thought
it
even
more

an

that

told

you
stand
before
the
choice

clearly

carry
on
the
battle
you
have

even
beyond
the

cautious
self
restraint
niemler
s
response
be
that
this
policy
might
be
correct
for
an
economic
enterprise
but
it
be
not
applicable
in

there

i
must

that
way
lead

great
credit
he
not

sought

intercede
on

others
who
be
non
aryan
under
the

schmitt
be
no
hero
but
he
be
no
coward
either
and
as
will
be
show
could
at
time
be
quite
reckless
in
his
speech

action
at
the

time
he
sin
cerely
believe
even
after
the
grim
experience
since
that
his
path
be
the
correct
one

that
it
be

duty
to
protect
the

in
his
care
and
fght
for
them
within

rather
than
pursue
a
catastrophic
policy
of
futile
opposition
ever
since
his

as
economics
minister
schmitt
have
fear

certainly
by
this

be

simply
left

also
come

the
conclusion
that

be
to

that

of

director
fritz

as
his

it
be
clear
that
tiedke
cannot
be
described
as
a
resister
in
the
sense
of
niemler
or
von

and
his
anti

posture
be
root
in
his
principled
business
conservatism
he
do
not
openly
challenge
the
regime
ideologically
there
be
simply
limit
to
the
political
compromise
he
be
prepared
to
make
and
to
the
type
of
person
with
whom
he
be

he

bitter
about

seven

before

age
hilgard

schmitt
undoubtedly
would
have
argue
that
tiedke
be
a
good
illustration
of
the
futility
and
impotence
to
which
one
condemn
oneself
by
fail

make
the
necessary
public

visible
compromise
they
have
make
in
order
to
save
what
could
be

in
any

the

certainly
do
not

this

also
propose

it
more
and
more
diffcult

nevertheless

indeed
the

widely

that
the
separation
of
the
european

from
london
provide
an
important

for
the

saw
the
situation

one
particularly
pro
pitious
for
reorganize

entire
european

in

and
his

begin
discuss
the
idea
of
create
a
reinsurance

to
replace
the
role
of
lloyd
s
of
london
and
other
british
frms
on
the
continent
it
be
important
to
note
that
this
be
no
easy
task
give
the
previous
role
played
by
the
british
the
vast
increase
of
insurable
risk
on
the
continent
during
the
war
and
the
inability
of
german
alone
to
as
sume
responsibility
for
them
one
would
have
to
mobilize
the
conquer
and
the
neutral
to
serve
the
need
of
europe
s
new
master
furthermore
schmitt
and
alzheimer
found
independent
enthusiasm
for
such
a
step
among
their
italian
partner
thus
when
alzheimer
met
with
the
ra
leader
frigessi
and
marche
sano
in
venice
in
october
frigessi
remark
that
it
should
at
the
present
time
be
the
task
of
the
german
and
italian
insurance
company
to
create
an
institution
that
can
as
far
as
possible
take
over
the
position
of
the
english
lloyd
s
in
most
area
the
continental
reinsurers
have
understood
how
to
replace
the
eng
lish
market
there
have
be
certain
diffculties
only
in
transport
insurance
excess
loss
and
other
exotic
business
but
even
for
these
company
it
be
desirable
to
set
up
continen
tal
coverage
possibility
on
the
basis
of
a
consolidation
of
a
large
number
of
insurance

in
the
form
of
a
consortium
in
which
group
of
insurance
carrier
voluntarily
sign
up
the
initiative
for
this
should
come
from
the
italian
and
german
company
alzheimer
inform
frigessi
that
these
idea
be
already
be
discuss
in
munich
but
that
one
also
want
to
bring
in
the
swiss
along
with
the
italian
and
german
market
schmitt
himself
held
discussion
with

of
the
other
major
italian
con
cern

as
well
as
with
the
swiss

and
he
seem
to
have
won
them
over
to
his
basic
and
rather
novel
conception
by
the
end
of
this
concep
tion
be
to
create
a
community
of
all
the
insurance
carrier
on
the
continent
for
the
purpose
of
cover
those
risk
whose
size
and
character
be
such
that
they
could
not
be
cover
by

mechanism
he
thought
it
important
that
the
community
be
continental
and
not
german
italian
but
he
also
felt
that

schmitt

especially
the

the

schmitt

that
enable

defcit
schmitt
go
on
to

what
germany
s
fnal
victory
would
mean
from
the
perspective
of
replace
england
internationally
as
the
lead

as
well
as
the
signifcance
of
this
combination
of
shipping

and
insurance
for
germany
s
balance
of

like
china
furthermore
this
be
not
only
an
economic
vision
but
also
a
political
one
since
a
large
trading
organization
and
network
of
representative
be
excellent

both

not

and
schmitt
point
out
how
ineffective
be
the
soviet
state
insurance

which
other
country
do
not
trust
and
do
not

the
victorious

now
give
germany
the
opportunity
to
take
advantage
of
its
po
sition
and
schmitt
mapped
out
a
clear
strategy
we
already
see
today
during
the
war
that
it
be
not
at
all
diffcult
to
orientate
the
insur
ance
market
completely
toward
germany
german
company
be
license
which
work
in
competition
with
their
domestic
counterpart
german
company
will
acquire
capital
participation
and
practically
turn
the
foreign
enterprise
into
daughter
company
and
thereby
to
branch
and
fnally
the
domestic
insurance
business
in
the
various
country
which
wisely
should
not
be
destroyed
will
become
accustom
to
place
large
portion
of
their
business
in
germany
thus
without
the
use
of
force
and
naturally
the
business
of
the
country
under
our
infuence
will
fow
naturally
into
a
unity
with
a
german
cen
ter
of
gravity
and
to
be
sure
all
the
more
naturally
the
less
external
pressure
and
force
will
be
perceive
and
felt
in
this
connection
schmitt
point
out
that
the
recently
create
association
for
the
coverage
of
large
risk
that
include
practically
all
the
nation
of
europe
be
the
frst
practical
expression
of
the
development
described
all
these
advantage
however
be
now
threaten
by
the
nationalization
plan
of
schwede
coburg
and
his
ally
building
insurance
be
the
keystone
of
the
insurance
business
because
of
the
large
premium
involve
and
the
easy
cal
culation
of
risk
and
the
provision
and
calculation
of
other
form
of
insurance
provide
by
the
private
insurer
depend
on
this
building
fre
insurance
market
therefore
the
insurance
business
would
be
severely
weaken
by
nationaliza
tion
and
its
general
credit
undermined
it
would
then
be
in
no
position
to
work
effectively
abroad
indeed
it
would
be
totally
dependent
on
foreign
insurer
when
work
internationally
it
would
also
encourage
other
country
to
take
similar
measure
and
so
lead
to
a
policy
of
mutual
exclusion
in
the
international
insurance
market
schmitt
propose
that
the
publicly
charter
company
in
the
feld
of
compulsory
building
insurance
all
be
turn
into
a
reich
corporation
that
would
compete
with
the
other
insurance
institution
offering
building
in
surance
that
special
provision
be
make
for
inexpensive
insurance
for
settlement
construction
project
and
that
the
entire
business
be
treat
like
the
compulsory
hunt
insurance
which
require
no
bureaucratic
structure
and
which
offer
insurance
from
a
variety
of
source
at
a
reasonable
price
schmitt
point
out
that
as
reich
hunt
master
ging
seem
to
be
quite
satisfed
with
the
ar
rangement
in
schmitt
s
view
however
the
issue
be
actually
a
basic
decision
schmitt
an
ging
m
rz
fha
s
as
to
whether
or
not
germany
want
to
have
an
effective
private
insurance
sys
tem
that
operate
on
international
market
that
be
whether
one
want
an
insurance
business
run
by
public
offcials
or
by
businessmen
for
schmitt
at
least
the
proper
national
socialist
economic
leadership
for
germany
and
the
world
be
one
in
which
the
economy
be
guide
but
not
manage
by
the
state
in
which
germany
would
be
prepared
to
assume
a
great
role
in
the
world
with
the
come
of
peace
and
in
which
the
german
people
be
service
by
an
effec
tive
insurance
system
after
the
war
have
be
won
he
thus
appeal
to
ging
to
secure
a
basic
decision
from
hitler
in
this
area
in
fact
ging
have
already
issue
an
order
on
march
ban
for
mal
discussion
of
nationalize
the
insurance
industry
during
the
come
year
and
suggest
that
the
question
be
suppress
in
order
to
avoid
far
con
fusion
this
be
offcially
communicate
on
april
the
trouble
be
that
individual
action
in
the
occupy
territory
have
implication
for
the
fu
ture
and
the
polycratic
nature
of
the
regime
meant
that
any
number
of
policy
could
be
pursue
at
the
same
time
for
example
schmitt
in
desperation
turn
to
himmler
and
sent
him
a
copy
of
his
letter
to
ging
but
himmler
refuse
to
grant
schmitt
an
audience
on
this
subject
since
he
do
not
want
to
interfere
in
the
insurance
controversy
the
most
extensive
response
to
schmitt
s
letter
which
be
widely
disseminate
come
from
martin
bormann
who
be
any
thing
but
convince
by
schmitt
s
argument
bormann
be
clearly
on
the
side
of
schwede
coburg
and
suggest
that
if
the
private
insurance
business
be
so
vulnerable
that
it
need
fre
insurance
premium
on
building
in
order
to
cover
its
more
risky
venture
then
it
should
be
totally
nationalize
insofar
as
the
in
ternational
issue
be
concerned
bormann
argue
that
the
insurance
business
give
out
more
in
foreign
exchange
than
it
take
in
that
germany
s
economic
role
in
the
world
would
ultimately
depend
on
the
political
situation
and
not
the
status
of
the
insurance
business
that
the
insurance
business
suffer
from
an
ex
ce
of
company
and
of
employee
and
that
the
money
it
receive
would
be
well
spent
on
damage
prevention
than
on
dividend
what
all
this
meant
be
a
constant
test
and
spar
between
the

force
him
to
take
a
more
basic
position
in
schwede
coburg
s
view
the
purpose
of

be
to
protect
the
german
people
against
the
consequence
of
accident
disaster

other
harm
and
to
serve

the
trustee
of

this

not

company
that
ful
flled
a

function
in

that

actually
only
some
true

in
the

finally
he
defend
the
signifcance
of
the

and
especially
emphasize
how
much
the
indus

have
write
directly
to

out
that
it
be
just
our
soldier

if
they

that

then
many
will
ask

the

such

that
the

be
de
moralize
to

expect

to
their

be
certainly
a
shrewd
form
of
propaganda
for
halt
the
debate
but
hilgard
still
have
a
hard
time
get
a
consistent
policy
from
the
authority
thus
on
the
same
day
january
bormann
sent
a
note
to
hilgard
declare
that
pub
lications
and
discussion
of
the
reform
of

be
undesirable
and
should
be
avoid
as
well
as
a
note
to
schmitt
declare
that
one
could
not
deny
rath
in
his
capacity
as
a
university
professor
the
right
to
discus
insurance
question
scientifcally
provide
that
such
publication
do
not
engage
in

hilgard
found
the

madden
when
the

the

schwede

however
use
the
reich

ministry
to
lift
the

the

that
rath
be
a

then
there
be
the
contradictory
instruction
of
bormann
it
be
hard
to
know
where
one
stood
but
what
seem
clear
be
that
despite
the

and
despite
the
order
of
the
party
chancellory
the
enemy

ironically
one
of
the
development
that
make

particularly
aware

particuarly
alarmed
that

especially
the
swiss
be
make
premature
concession
that
franco
could
use
to
increase

the
german
be
anxious
to
work
closely
with
the
english

french
to
create
some
solidarity
in

however
be

an

complicate
question

it

in

some
insurance
leader
be
more
inter
ested

in

one
of
the
difference
between
kurt
schmitt

han
he
for
example
be
that
the
former
be
enthusiastic
about

oppose

the
come
of
the

put
a
limit
on
such
personal
predilection
though
it
help
explain
why
schmitt
in
contrast
to
he
be
often
so
visibly
active
on
behalf
of
allianz
interest
in
the
occu
pied
area
a
decision
to
be
totally
uninvolved
and
to
stay
home
would
be
tantamount
to
go
out
of

and
it
would
be
unrealistic
for
the
histo

hilgard
claimed

he
and
those
of

with
any

realize
this

could

which
depend

that
it
be

in

the
infuence
of

raa
and
with
the

through

german

work
with

we
will

not
be

entirely
out

yet
some
well
inform

well

at

spoke
bluntly
in

walther

of

re
in
of
the
impose
participation
of

he
have
apparently
intend

make
this

with
respect
to
the
daf

in

article
but
then
decide
to
drop
the
issue
however
as

told
meuschel

participation
be

in
southeastern

in
france
in

in
what

then
the

the
netherlands
and
that
not
only
by
the
daf
group
also
not
from
reinsurers
alone
but
also
from
primary
insurer
in

who
would
want
to
maintain
that
all
the

be
it
useful
to

when

suppresses
or
even
maintains
that
the
german
insurance
business
be
guiltless
or
harmless
with
respect
to
all
the
economic
sin

that

since

they
sought
to
veil
the

actually
be
played
by

second
there
be
general
agreement
that
the
czech

too
many
small

that

he
bluntly
add
that
the

that
be
the

it

however
to
transfer
people
from
unproductive
enterprise
to

enterprise
and
to
retrain
them
accordingly
no
consideration
can
be
give
in
the

a

they
leapt
at
the
opportunity

be
indeed
of
the
essence
because
volksfsorge
be
also
after
the

argue
that
they
belong
to

cooperative
and
thus
should
properly
go
to

also
be
the
proper
agency
to

a
popular
insurance
organization
apparently
daf
offcials
thought
this
argument
would
be
particularly
appeal
to
the
gestapo
for
political
and
social
reason
and
that
security
interest
could
be
combine
with
an
appeal
to
anticapitalist
sentiment
in
attempt
to
promote
the
daf
cause
munich
re
however
claimed
that
it
have
a
prior
option
an
argument
that
rosenkranz
be
prepared
to
accept
since
the
crucial
issue
be
place
control
of
cechoslavia
in
german
hand
never
theless
as
mattfeld
report
rosenkranz
obviously
well
aware
of
anti
big
business
sentiment
among
the
more
radical
nazi
do
remark
that
munich
re
as
a
plutocratic
democratic
and
liberal
corporation
be
not
exactly
popular
in
many
quarter
it
be
typical
of
the
national
socialist
to
defne
western
capitalist
enterprise
as
plutocratic
and
to
confate
plutocracy
with
democ
racy
and
liberalism
it
be
only
fair
to
note
however
that
the
relation
between
see
especially
the
aktennote
of
april
juli
and
juni
and
the
exchange

the

that
munich

the

that
they
have

this

that
it
therefore
lie
in

that

country
since
this
would
serve
to
limit
the
italian
competition
as
well
the
most
important
question
however
be
what
to
do
about
the
of
greek
fre
insurance
in
the
hand
of
english
company
the
german
and
italian
have
of
the
business
while
the
greek
company
have
the
remainder
an
agreement
be
reach
between
the
italian
and
german
company
to
divide
the
english
portfolio
among
the
german
italian
and
greek
on
the
basis
of
a
split
however
this
scheme
prove
diffcult
to
implement
owe
to
the
confuse
administrative
situ
ation
in
greece
which
be
allow
to
retain
a
government
with
the
appearance
of
sovereignty
and
which
be
in
the
process
of
change
its
occupation
regime
from
a
german
to
an
italian
one
as
a
result
the
english
company
have
not
be
place
under
trusteeship
and
there
be
a
danger
that
the
english
portfo
lio
would
end
up
in
the
hand
of
the
greek
company
because
there
would
be
no
authority
to
prevent
this
furthermore
the
greek
be
constantly
found
ing
small
new
insurance
company
a
fairly
easy
task
because
the
infationary
situation
and
monetary
overhang
make
it
possible
to
meet
the
minimal
cash
requirement
of
start
a
new
company
yet
another
problem
be
that
no
sur
vey
exist
of
the
actual
english
portfolio
and
their
value
a
task
turn
over

the

the

to

with
their
italian

at

the
big

the
infa

which
remind
the

there

most

that

a
good
reputation
for
themselves

as
highly

and
more
highly

nevertheless
the
basic
problem
remain
the
infation
the
fact
that
the
greek
could
not
pay
the
high
occupation
cost
and
the
unwillingness
of
the
greek
to
accept
the
lira
as
their
new
currency
because
they
saw
this
as
complete
subju
gation
to
the
italian
by
april
of
course
the
italian
be
out
of
the
picture
while
greece
be
in
the

of
a

the

the

by

which

that

begin

then
use

take
it
out
of

at

between

he
cultivate
every
conceivable
connection
in
the
hungarian
offcialdom
nobility
and

the
culmination
be
a
breakfast
of
the
high
and
mighty
at
the
grand

in
budapest
on
april
whereafter
he
be
assure
that
wiener
allianz
would
receive
a
concession
matter
do
not
move
quite
that
quickly
however
because
schmidt
polex
and
the
home
offces
of
allianz
apparently
have
large
ambition
they
want
to
offer
not
only
property
and
accident
insurance
in
hungary
but
also
life
insur
ance
the
idea
be
that
wiener
allianz
would
sell
the
life
insurance
directly
but
be
reinsure
by
allianz
leben
this
be
in
fact
a
very
odd
pro
posal
since
the
liability
would
still
rest
with
wiener
allianz
and
the
proposal
violate
the
raa
principle
that
life
and
property
insurance
might
coexist
in
the
same
concern
but
not
in
the
same
corporate
entity
when
the
raa
inquire
of
goudefroy
what
allianz
have
in
mind
goudefroy
claimed
that
there
be
a
good
market
for
foreign
company
in
hungary
as
demonstrate
by
victoria
and
the
italian
insurer
operating
there
and
that
german
corporation
would
be
par
ticularly
welcome
because
of
all
that
germany
have
do
to
rectify
the
dictate
peace
of
trianon
furthermore
there
be
potential
customer
among
the
many
german
in
the
region
of
romania
and
yugoslavia
that
have
be
give
to
hun
gary
goudefroy
conclude
that
we
believe
therefore
that
wiener
allianz
can
build
up
a
large
life
insurance
portfolio
in
hungary
than
we
have
until
now
be
able
to
do
in
country
that
be
not
as
politically
close
to
us
as
for
exam
ple
greece
and
egypt
the
raa
however
be
not
at
all
convince
they
do
not
think
that
the
hungarian
would
consider
it
legitimate
for
wiener
al
lianz
to
sell
life
insurance
when
its
business
have
be
property
insurance
and
more
importantly
they
do
not
believe
that
the
market
be
there
since
the
insur
ance
feld
be
already
too
overcrowd

both
in

but
one
of
the

less

the

budapest
in
march

the
establishment
of

brutal

be

in

deplorably
cynical
and
inhumane
report
from
budapest
by
the
itinerant

to
the

at

in

a

create

hilgard
apparently
be
unable
to
make
the
trip
but
mayrhofer
alzheimer
and
herzog
go
to
hungary
in
mid
july
and
report
back
to
the
rwm
on
the
situation
they
cynically
criticize
the
hungarian
for
think
in
con
trast
to
the
german
and
austrian
that
one
have
to
solve
the
jewish
problem
in
hungary
with
one
blow
this
be
apparently
a
mistake
because
of
the
eco
nomic
consequence
as
the
german
be
indifferent
to
the
human
loss
that
transpire
thus
the
effect
of
the
drive
out
of
the
jew
be
to
cause
an
ini
tial
phase
of
serious
economic
stagnation
this
be
understandable
in
a
city
like
budapest
where
of
the
million
inhabitant
be
jew
the
personnel
consquences
be
also
serious
for
the
insurance
industry
especially
with
respect
to
the
importance
of
jewish
adjuster
who
be
specialist
in
area
like
textile
and
leather
the
loss
of
premium
from
jewish
business
be
also
re
grettable
because
it
be
hard
to
say
when
non
jew
could
replace
them
since
so
many
hungarian
men
be
now
be
call
up
by
the
military
the
only
relief
be
that

of

uncertain
regard
the
status
of
the
german
company
in
the
unoccupied

and
he
point
out
that
the
ger
man
company
would
have
to
charge
french
rate
but
that
the

of

for

company
operat
ing
in

could
be
make
by

guarantee
rather
than
in

he
worried
that
the
french
would
set
up
some
kind
of
pool
rather
than
allow
free
commerce
in
insurance
and
fear
that
the
french
supervisory
board
be
behind
the
idea
insurance
company
operating
in
lorraine
and
alsace
which
still
formally
be
long
to
france
but
would
be
reintegrate
into
the
reich
would
be
subject
to
special
restriction
due
to
the
special
wish
and
plan
of
the
gauleiter
amend
promise
in
any
case
that
karlsruher

badische
pferdeversicherungs
anstalt
ag
both
part
of
the
allianz
concern
would
be
license
in
lorraine
and
alsace
and
that
karlsruher
leben
would
be
give
trusteeship
over
the
frm
of
rhein
und
mosel
that
be
place
in
control
of
its
operation
and
asset
on
behalf
of
the
german
government
indeed
he
promise
that
allianz
would
have
the
most
signifcant
english
and
french
portfolio
in
the
area
while
the
publicly
charter
company
would
gain
trusteeship
of
the
elsa
lothringen
versicherungs

schmitt
protest
on
the
ground
that
allianz
have
such
large
share
of
the
latter
frm
amend
held
fast
on
the
question
of
property
insurance
but
he
be
prepared
to
concede
allianz
trusteeship
of
the
company
s
life
insurance
portfolio
finally
schmitt
point
out
that
the
interest
of
german
insurer
in
the
occupy
country
stem
from
the
fact
that
one
could
an
ticipate
grow
german
industrial
and
commercial
activity
in
these
area
that
need
insurance
but
he
thought
it
important
that
indigenous
insurance
com
panies
be
maintain
to
deal
with
normal
business
and
that
the
german
role
be
that
of
reinsurers
rather
than
direct
insurer
here
too
there
seem
to
be
basic
harmony
of
view
between
amend
and
schmitt
this
be
extraordinary
enough
but
what
be
particularly
strike
be
the
com
plete
identifcation
of
allianz
and
munich

to
which
allianz
be
be
give
a
most
favor
position
with
regard
to
the
english
portfolio
this
be
no
trivial
matter
since
the
british
held
half
of
france
s
insurance
portfolio
in
which
amount
to
billion
franc
indeed
in

hilgard

the
right
to

all
such

in

although
reject
the

would
solve

and
ch

seem
to
suggest
that
the
implementation
of
the

which
be
limited
to
eight
month
might
be
such
as
to
obviate

there

some

the
appointment
of

for
the
eng
lish
frms
operating
in
france
with
ch
neaux
argue
that
there
be
no
need
for

trustee
and
that
many
of
the
english
frms
have
move
their
offces
and
documentation
into
the
unoccupied
area
of
france
hilgard
recognize
that
the
german
company
could
hardly
provide
the
personnel
to
administer
the
hun
dred
english
frms
in
france
do
so
would
require
each
german
corporation
license
for
business
in
france
to
administer
seven
english
company
but
he
be

that
german
have
trustee
of
their
own
appoint
for
general
over
sight
while
the
french
do
most
of
the
actual
administrative
work
actually
the
german
be
already
do
a
bit
more
than
that
and
hilgard
intend
to
act
upon
the
point
of
difference
between
himself
and
ch
neaux
in
way
that
would
determine
the
outcome
in

thus
on

he
express
outrage

set

he

it

exclud

the
most

in
this
respect
be
raise

espe
cially
in
fre
insurance
which
be
in
a
chaotic
and
insuffciently
proftable
state
the
british
insurer
have
apparently
undermined
the
high
premium
exist
in
the
industrial
region
of
france
before
the
first
world
war
by
come

propriate

furthermore
the
low
premium
be
not
as
originally
intend
limited
to
northern
france
but
rather
spread
to
the
rest
of
the
country
so
that
the
french
company
be
as
anxious
as
the
german
to
raise
the
level
of
premium
nevertheless
the
german
insurer
suffer
from
rather
contradictory
feeling
about
this
program
of
reconstruct
the
premium
system
to
make
it
appropriately
proftable
in
the

the

the
french
do
not

their

be
at

the
fact
that
high

disproportionately

thus
while
the
french
accepted
a

increase
for

in

they
also
give
the

a
three

they

charge
only

economically
desirable
when

met
on

the

contest

that

lead

however
to
prevent
any

urge
that
the

as
to

a

s
expectation
that
the
well
portfolio
would
fall
to
them
or
to

belgian

however
soon
prove
rather
problematic
for

sixteen
german
company
license

work
in
belgium
on
the
one
hand
the
belgian
company
take
advantage

their
relative
lack

organizational
and
supervi
sory
constraint
to

company
on

they
be
quite
aggressive
in
try
to
gain
control
of

this
be
e
pecially
evident
at

of
the

of

could

assure

the
belgian
director
francis

respond
that
the
english
have
gain
so
large
a
share
of
the
belgian
market
after
the
great

by
underprice
their

take
away
the
well
risk
while
leave
the
belgian
with
the
poorer
one
for
this
reason
the
belgian
insurance

now
have
the
wish
to
get
back
again
this
business
which
originally
belong
to
their

they
therefore
have
be
strive
not
to
share
this
business
with
any
foreigner
and
to
be
sure
also
with
no
englishman
hilgard
apparently
found
this
a
bit
much
and
respond
that
the
drop
out
of
the
english
be
a
consequence
of
the
war
won
by
germany
and
it
will
not
do
that
the
fruit
of
this
war
now
be
exclusively
claimed
by
the
belgian
company
if
the
desire
of
the
german
insurance
company
for
a
reasonable
participation
in
belgium
be
not
satisfed
then
he
hilgard
do
not
know
what
will
happen
he
also
considers
it
well
in
the
interest

the

come
to
an
understand

con
siders
it
in
their

if
they
themselves
do
something
about
it
these
remark
left
little
to
the
imagination
and
the
belgian
come
up
with
a
self
deny

the

it

be

in

finally
it

furthermore

the

it

to

that

this

signifcantly
diminish
by

from

the

contemplate

argue
in

of

so
long
as

jew
re

in

that

it
have
to
remain

especially
to

from
newly
save
or
earn
money
free
of
confscation
in
the

the
question
in
be
whether
to
bring
this
far
to
the
attention
of
the
polish
public
the
polish
jew
obviously
do
not
come
into
con
sideration
by
this
time
and
encourage
save
in
the
economics
ministry
there
be
some
skepticism
as
to
whether
the
pole
have
anything
to
save
under
exist
condition
and
also
whether
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
spell
out
what
the
con
fscation
policy
have
be
nevertheless
krier
the
hto
offcial
charge

thought
that
not
only
saving
but
also
insurance
should
be
encour
age
among
ethnic
pole
as
he
brutally
conclude
this
should
in
no
way
be
view
as
a
danger
to
the
german
interest
since
a
newly

upper
stratum
would
undoubtedly
as
soon
as
it
becomes
expedient

necessary
be
deport

the

the
fate

it

it

piece

a

have
make
it
possible

this

situation
take
over
all
the
jewish
frms
closing
down

manage
the
rest

they

this

up

however
that

give
also
there
be
little
point
since
no

to

at

another

make
at

act
on

of
the
consortium
for
a
total
policy
that
have
risen
to
million
rm
suggest
that
a
low
premium
might
be
offer
if
at
least
the
area
of
great
risk
could
be
directly
inspect
alternatively
it
provide
a
question
naire
that
might
be
flled
out
to
help
insurer
calculate
their
risk
it
be
the
questionnaire
that
won
out
and
no
on
site
inspection
be
allow
these
rejection
of
inspection
could
only
heighten
the
sense
that
condition
in
the
ghetto
be
very
different
from
those
on
the
outside
however
there
be
no
reason
to
think
that
the
insurer
engage
in
the
negotiation
actually
care
since
they
be
ask
to
enter
the
ghetto
not
out
of
curiosity
but
rather
out
of
concern
for
run
risk
by
not
engage
in
on
site
inspection
and
even
though
insurance
company
representative
never
have
any
direct
negotiation
with
rumkowski
it
be
clearly
state
by
biebow
and
ribbe
that
the
insurer
be
ultimately
deal
with
the
jewish
council
and
its
leader
because
it
be
the
responsibility
of
the
jew
to
account
for
the
material
be
insured
make
sure
it
be
kept
safely
and
in
effect
to
cover
the
cost
of
the
insurance
as
ribbe
in
form
hner
i
continue
now
as
before
to
judge
the
risk
favorable
since
the
jewish

place
a
permanent
guard
in
the

at
this

it
be
unclear
whether

it

highly
unlikely

this
would
be
unusual
for
a

into
which
plaszow

be
transform
this
change
of
status
meant
that

now
do
business
with

because
the
latter
manage
the

this
support
the
assumption
that
the
policy
at
this

cover
only
production
and
not
prisoner

thus
the

for

million

record
one
can
imagine

an

like
beier
would
cling
to
his
s
business
to
the
very
last
but
it
be
diffcult
to
fathom
what
would
move
the
new
consortium
to
seek
this
business
in
one
answer
may
lie
in
the
fact
that
the
business
world
and
the
insurance
company
have
become
so
habituate
to
work
and
expand
ing
with
the
regime
that
it
become
diffcult
not
to
continue
even
as
the
camp
and
their
factory
be
be
capture
by
allied
force

the
insured

be
shut
down

nothing
to

the

continual

it

without

some
of
the

certainly
not
for
those
who
dealt
with

quite
plausibly
not

the

do
not

emergency
meeting
of
the

advisory

on
february
after
the

ask

proposal
to
signifcantly
reduce
the
number
of
those

in
the

in
hilgard
s
view
three
group
of
activity
have
to
be
distinguish
from
one
another
first
there
be
the
gathering
of
new
business
which
encompass
the
entire
process
that
begin
with
advertising
and
end
with
issue
a
new
policy
second
there
be
the
administration
of
exist
ing
portfolio
finally
there
be
the
handle
of
claim
in
hilgard
s
view
the
latter
two
activity
be
of
importance
to
the
war
effort
and
could
not
be
shut
down
thus
the
only
area
in
which
hilgard
thought
personnel
saving
be
possible
be
advertising
and
sale
even
here
however
hilgard
wish
to
avoid
a
total
shutdown
point
out
that
those
over
year
of
age
be
not
mobilize
and
that
many
such
person
need
the
money
and
be
available
as
be
those
permanently
disabled
by
the
war
he
thought
that
one
could
also
continue
to
use
person
for
whom
insurance
sell
be
a
side
activity
although
this
would
have
to
be
in
the
context
of
the
labor
mobilize
effort
of
the
government
he
be
also
prepared
to
release
offcials
and
inspector
insofar
as
they
be
primarily
concerned
with
gain
new
business
and
in
general
thought
that
the
industry
could
release
of
its
employee
by
such
work
reduction
measure
as
cut
back
or
eliminate
audit
and
accounting
requirement
for
the
rest
of
the
war
in
order
to
maintain
effectiveness
however
task
reduction
would
be
necessary
and
hilgard
urge
that
for
the
duration
of
the
war
policyholder
not
be
per
mitted
to
terminate
policy
in
order
to
take
out
new
one
this
would
at
once
reduce
the
quest
for
new
business
and
protect
insurance
salesman
who
have
be
complain
about
lose
business
while
at
the
front
hilgard
be
quite
doubt
ful
about
effort
to
consolidate
the
industry
at
this
point
the
experience
at
allianz
have
demonstrate
that
concentration
and
consolidation
be
measure
whose
benefts
become
visible
only
with
the
passage
of
time
and
could
not
be
expect
to
bring
immediate
saving
of
labor
in
the
discussion
that
follow
hilgard
met
with
little
opposition
from
the
head
of
the
various
economic
group
although
there
be
a
good
deal
of
skep
ticism
as
to
whether
one
would
really
reduce
the
number
of
employ
by
as
have
frequently
be
the

at

the

would
create
noth
ing
but
more
work

confusion
to

a
very
diffcult
problem
that
hilgard
felt
need
more
consideration
be
of

seek
add

a

premium
actual

amount

the

and
this
would
cost
much
labor
if

nothing

the

both
of

by

apparently
felt
that
any

they
add

to
either
carry
out

by
the
unrealistic

face

so
often
the

hilgard
turn
to
the

he

that

would
only
bring
disorder
into

he
go
on
to
detail
the
false
assumption
under
which
the

operating
and
to
reiterate
his
claim
that

no

indeed
some
ten

later
hilgard
be
able
to
describe
the
futility
of
the

with
the
example
of

hilgard
understandably

nevertheless
it

under

he
employ
testimony
from

which
warn
that

the

would
have
negative
consequence

of

s

in
this
area
here
at
least
hilgard
have
a
good
case
but
from
a
historical
perspective
his
argument
constitutes
strong
evidence
of
the
concern
s
direct
and
heavy
in
volvement
in
the
war
effort
such
contribution
to
the
war
effort
do
not
end
all
effort
to
comb
out
nonessential
industry
likeinsurance
but
both
the
raa
and
the
rwm
seem
to
become
quite
concerned
by
late
and
during
that
call
ups
be
reach
the
point
where
the
entire
fnancial
sector
i
e
bank
and
insurance
company
would
become
nonfunctional
the
situation
be
worsen
by
the
tendency
of
gauleiter
and
party
offcials
to
take
matter
into
their
own
hand
and
take
ac
tions
that
ran
contrary
to
the
ministry
instruction
yet
another
problem
be
the
military
call
up
of
key
person
in
the
company
and
the
threat
this
carry
of
decapitate
the
company
operation
for
which
they
be
responsible
it
be
interest
to
note
that
the
allianz
offces
in
berlin
be
permit
by
the
labor
offce
to
use
some
foreign
employee
who
be
either
prisoner
of
war
or
foreigner
obligate
to
work
in
germany
of
them
french
offcers
and
czech
all
of
whom
have
work
in
the
insurance
or
banking
sector
back
at
home
as
well
as
such
employee
from
belgium
the
netherlands
and
latvia
director
maiholzer
described
them
as
force
laborer
but
he
hasten
to
add
that
relation
with
these
person
be
especially
good
that
they
pitch
in
with
their
german
compatriot
in
air
raid
and
that
they
be
well
treat
give
that
these
individual
be
familiar
with
the
kind
of
work
be
do
at
allianz
which
be
certainly
less
onerous
than
that
do
by
force
labor
in
industry
maiholzer
s
claim
seem
plausible
apparently
the
berlin
offces
also
employ
some
jew
and
part
jew
supply
by
the
labor
offce
and
maiholzer
claimed
they
be
never
subject
to
abuse
by
supervisory
personnel
in
any
case
the
concern
cannot
be
consider
a
signifcant
employer
of
force
labor
because
the
priority
for
assign
such
labor
lay
elsewhere
therefore
in
the
last
year
of
the
war
allianz
clearly
have
more
business
than
it
could
handle
both
because
of

that
there

a
misunderstand
in
the

this

be
a
matter
for
the
swiss

it

that
they

compromise
under
which
the
german
would
immedi
ately
pay
the
million

for
while
the
swiss
would

would
not
be

until
the

of

an
important
aspect
of
this

be
the
anticipa
tion
that

able

that

be
on
the

and
the

unabashedly
try
to
get
as
much
from
the
german
as
they
could
before
the
end
come
this
effort
be
complicate
far
on
febru
ary
when
the
swiss
federal
council
fnally
succumbed
to
allied
pressure
and
issue
a
freeze
on
all
german
asset
as
well
as
a
ban
on
business
with
germany
needle
to
say
this
put
the
entire
arrangement
with
the
insurer
in
danger
along
with
the
plan
to
assist
other
swiss
creditor
in
a
similar
manner
nevertheless
the
arrangement
between
the
german
and
swiss
with
respect
to
insurance
be
confrmed
on
february
as
if
it
have
no
bearing
whatever
on
the
agreement
with
the

and
especially
on
the
negotiation
with
president
roosevelt
s
represen
tative
lauchlin
currie
much
would
depend
therefore
on
the
impend
swiss
negotiation
with
the
vice
president
of
the
reichsbank
emil
puhl
puhl
do
indeed
offer
gold
some
of
the
swiss
offcials

as
robert

head
of
the
legal
and
private
asset
abroad
section
of
the
political
section
of
the
federal
government
thought
that
it
might
be
accepted
to
cover
the
insurance
obligation
he
admit
that
it
be
certainly
diffcult
to
take
gold
since
one
do
not
know
from
where
it
come
and
one
cannot
tell
by
the
smell
from
whence
it
be
steal
or
robbed
but
he
kohli
hope
that
the
ally
would
see
that
it
be
well
if
germany
pay
us
this
gold
to
fulfll
its
obligation
than
when
the
gold
otherwise
go
foating
about
but
walter
stucki
the
much
harrassed
head
of
the
political
department
of
the
swiss
foreign
offce
have
no
more
taste
for
gold
purchase
and
far
allied
protest
on
this
score
and
he
told
koenig
that
the
swiss
government
could
not
accept
the
gold
nevertheless
koenig
do
manage
to
get
the
insurance
business
exclude
from
any
payment
ban
with
respect
to
the
reichsbank
account
so
that
something
could
still
be
save
of
the
agreement
what
could
be
save
be
still
an
open
question
but
it
be
strike
how
anx
ious
the
german
insurance
leader
be
to
maintain
the
relationship
in
these
last
month
of
the
war
and
to
continue
do
business
in
switzerland
the
block
ing
of
german
account
and
freeze
on
german
business
very
much
alarmed
the
german
and
they
be
even
more
upset
to
learn
that
the
agreement
between
storck
and
the
insurer
of
december
and
january
might
be
unful
fllable
because
there
might
not
be
enough
in
the
reichsbank
account
to
cover
them
thus
in
mid
march
alzheimer
and
schmitt
request
permission
to
visit
switzerland
to
negotiate
with
their
swiss
contact

on
his
mission
in
a
detailed

be
to

emphasize
that
he

in

to
make
possible
the
continued
operation

especially
here
the
strongly

german

alzheimer

swiss
colleague
demonstrate
great
understand
for
his
proposal

he
found
completely
loyal

he
thus
believe
he
have
accomplish
his
goal
of
exclude
the
german

the
freeze
of
their
asset
and
permit
those
under
german
infuence
to
continue
op

although
this
involve
very
complicate
arrangement
with
the
swiss

with
respect

as
functional
as
possible
despite
all
good
will
it
be
now
a
race
against
time
to
see
if
anything
could
be
save
of
the
arrangement
to
pay
the
swiss
insurer
from
reichsbank

as
guggenbl
report
on
march
one
could
no
longer
expect
the
million
due
in
to
be
paid
since
the
money
be
not
there
and
there
be
press
claim
for
some
million

by
swiss
creditor

these
if
the
transfer
be
still
technically
possible
before
germany
collapse
million
would
be
avail
able
for
the
insurance
payment
obviously
they
have
hop
for
more
but
as
guggenbl
note
the
transfer
agreement
have
enable
million
swiss

to
be
transfer
and
have
thus
be
a
great
success
finally
a

the

von

have
agree
in
that
he
could
effectively
work
half

if
he
wish
but
he
have
never
take
advantage
of
this
offer
and
ask
to
resign
at
the

nevertheless
in

he
use

situation
to
make
a
new

to
resign
inform
von

that
his
country

be

for

and
this
be
force
him
to
make
a
decision
between
his
berlin
and
his
country
home
since
he
could
not
expect
to
retain
both
under
exist
circumstance
he
decide
to
return
to
agnesdorf
which
meant
that
his
berlin
quarter
would
be
sequester
for
bombing
victim
under
these
circumstance
he
need
to
resign
since
he
thought
it
improper
to
serve
as
general
director
from
the
safety
of
his
estate
while
the
other
employee

but
he
be
prepared
to
serve
the
concern
in
any
other
way
the
supervisory
board
might
deem
appropriate
once
again
however
von
finck
dissuade
he
from
this
purpose
and
frustrate
schmitt
s
effort
to
create
a
new
succession
schmitt
be
probably
correct
in
later
surmise
that
he
really
found
it
hard
to
leave
his
position
and
stop
be
active
but
what
be
truly
remarkable
be
that
he
remain
an
asset
to
the
concern
during
these
year
despite
his
fairly
obvious
hostility
to
the
nazi
regime
he
apparently
refrain
from
use
the
nazi
salute
demonstrably
do
not
sign
his
business
correspondence
with
heil

do
not

have
also
be
show
in
the
case
of
maximilian
eichbaum
he
be
know
to
protect
jew
most
serious
however
be
that
he
have
some
close
contact
to
the
resistance
and
be
apparently
aware
of
the
existence
of
a
circle
of
offcers
planning
to
kill
hitler
although
it
be
unclear
if
he
knew
the
specifcs
of
the
july
plot
as
he
explain
somewhat
misleadingly
after
the
war
i
drew
the
ultimate
consequence
when
i
join
with
the
men
who
over
the
year
have
continuously
forge
plan
to
bring
down
the
entire
nazi
structure
with
an
act
of
force
this
suggests
a
participation
in
the
movement
for
which
there
be
no
evidence

chief
contact
with
the

that

that

at
the
manner
in
which
he
have
communicate

worried
about
what
might

apparently
von

felt
it
impor

to
cover
itself
in
the
event
that
he
decide
to
stay
in

thus
for
those
on
the

to
demonstrate
that
they
have
take
action
in

an
investigation
take

it
clearly
be
odd
for
the
general
director
of
so
large
a
concern
as
allianz
to
be
absent
from
so
impor
tant
a

however
when
he
heard
from
schmitt
about
the
discussion
of
his
absence
at
the
meeting
he
be
infuriate
point
out
in
an
angry
letter
to
von
finck
that
at
the
age
of
and
after
year
of
service
to
the
company
he
knew
what
his
obligation
be
and
do
not
need
to
be
inform
of
them
by
a
supervisory
board
he
be
especially
annoyed
because
it
be
von
finck
after
all
who
have
persuade
him
to
stay
on
the
job
in
the
frst
place
on
october
he
then
sent
von
finck
his
electrocardiogram
and
a
medical
report
attest
to
the
seriousness
of
his
illness
he
who
wish
to
impress
on
von

how
much
he
be
sacrifcing
for
the
concern
by
stay
on
under
the
exist
circum
stance
remark
that
the
worsen
of
his
condition
have
much
to
do
with
his
experience
during
the
last
bombing
attack
on
allianz
in
berlin
he
then
re
port
far
on
his
condition
on

although
his
doctor
in
basel
have
urge
him
to
rest
and
continue
treatment
and
although
he
have
also
con
tracted

he
decide
to
return

to
their
safety
area
in

by
this
time
the
relation
ship
with
von

have
become
very
troubled
indeed
von

be
angry
that
he
have
be
so
critical
in
a
letter
especially
since
it
have
be
open
by
the
censor
and
believe
that
such
question
should
be
dealt
with
verbally
rather
than
in
write
as
for
he
he
felt
deeply
hurt
that
he
have
receive
an
undeserved
vote
of
no
confdence
in
fact
von
finck
have
come
to
the
conclu
sion
that
he
be
a
liability
and
in
a
letter
of
november
use
he
s
health
as
an
excuse
to
declare
that
the
supervisory
board
would
not
ask
him
to
stay
on
for
he
however
have
no
intention
of
let
himself
be
fred
in
this
man
ner
in
a
response

he
announce
to

he
would
be
happy
to
hear
that
he

now
fully

he
have
never
take
advantage
of
his
extraordinary
offer
to
work
half
time
for
the
concern
back
in

also
that
at
their
meeting
in

they
have
solemnly
shaken
hand
in
agreement
that

that
just

in

should
stand
at
the
head

who
would
be
possess
of
robust
health
the
strong
est

and
the
great

if
the
supervisory

such
a

then
i

cheerfully
step
down

the

their

subordinate
themselves

put
their

their

not

frighten

nauseate
boehm
have
obviously
not

twelve

and
he
undoubtedly
be
respond
to
schmitt
s
open
or
veil
pessimism
schmitt
chose
to
thank
boehm
for
his
letter
and
to
remark
that
your
confdence
and
report
pleased
me
after
all
the
heavy
sacrifces
and
fantastic
accomplishment
of
our
people
a
victory
of
our
arm
would
be
no
gift
but
rather
something
well
earn
it
be
hard
to
believe
that
schmitt
really
be
lieved
this
the
issue
after
all
be
not
the
sacrifces
and
accomplishment
but
rather
the
cause
in
which
they
have
be
make
schmitt
be
defnitely
in
no
posi
tion
to
speak
his
mind
about
that
cause
in
a
letter
and
certainly
not
to
the
like
of
boehm
furthermore
there
be
good
evidence
that
schmitt
be
sympathetic
to
the
re
sistance
and
have
an
unusually
good
understand
of

opponent
of

begin
to
talk
about
the
war
and
military
situation
he
fear
that
eliminate
hitler
would
feed
another
stab
in
the
back
legend
turn
hitler
into
a

all
the
blame

the
failure
of
the

on
his
close

he
try

the

schmitt

more
suspect

than

because

with

thus
when

to

sacrifces
he
knew
whereof
he
spoke
for
schmitt
and
his
family
the
war
end
in
the
same
kind
of
personal
tragedy
with
which
it

begin
the

klaus

confront
the
past
denazifcation
and
restitution
it
be
a
mistake
to
claim
as
have
often
be
the
case
until
recently
that
german
in
general
and
german
businessmen
in
particular
do
not
confront
the
national
socialist
past
after
world
war
ii
the
real
problem
be
the
manner
in
which
they
do
so
recent
research
on
west
german
industry
have
show
that
its
leader
be
preoccupy
and
in
case
where
they
be
subject
to
lengthy
denazifcation
proceeding
or
threat
of
socialization
even
obsess
with
the
nazi
past
and
their
role
in
it
they
developed
both
personal
and
organize
way
of
try
to
deal
with
that
past
that
be
personally
bearable
but
that
also
permit
them
to
present
a
case
to
the
outside
world
that
at
once
legitimize
the
personal
rehabil
itation
of
those
who
be
accuse
of
work
with
the
national
socialist
and
make
the
case
for
reconstruction
of
german
industry
along
traditional
line
as
shall
be
demonstrate
here
this
be
also
true
of
the
leader
of
the
insurance
business
and
of
the
insurance
industry
itself
indeed
this
confrontation
with
the
nazi
period
be
an
inescapable
necessity
for
three
reason
first
business
leader
be
subject
to
denazifcation
if
in
retrospect
the
denazifcation
appear
to
have
be
poorly
conceive
and
incon
sistently
and
inadequately
implement
it
nevertheless
require
the
flling
out
of
lengthy
and
detailed
questionnaire
liability
to
internment
in
some
instance
as
well
as
dismissal
and
blockage
of
account
in
many
others
and
subjection
to
legal
proceeding
that
could
lead
to
signifcant
penalty
if
those
appear
be
fore
the
tribunal
do
not
succeed
in
exonerate
themselves
in
the
last
analysis
the

prove
something

generate
a
great

this

rapidly
apparent
in

the

much
on

involve
the
german

community
either
directly
or
indirectly
this

the

nevertheless
the

in
the
third

as
it
found
articulation
during

there

in

when
these

come
up
again
and
there
be
good
evidence
for

then
it

the

how
and
why
it
might

be
transform

in
the
german
insurance

in

it

that
the

create

be
not

interested

since
they
perceive
the

transform

overnight
write
of
these

could
not
refrain
from
describe
his
frst
post
capitulation
visit
to
potsdam
in
february
in
a
manner
that
suggest
that
he
remain
susceptible
to
the
spell
that
certain
event
of
must
still
have
held
for
him
thus
he
be
shock
by
the
condition
of
the
garrison
church
and
note
par
ticularly
the
unprotected
and
miserable
condition
of
the
grave
of
the
old
fritz
across

have

venerable
fag
at
the

of
the
seizure
of

on

apparently
maiholzer
found
it
impossible
to
let
refection
about
the
connection
between
the
unnamed
reich
chancellor
the
day
of
potsdam

the
condition
of
the

in
interfere
with
such
sentimental
reminiscence

a

tour
of
potsdam
and
his
observation
of
the
russian
general
and
troop
who
rule
there
rapidly
brought
him
back
to
reality

me
anew
to
be
satisfed
with
our
condition

also
fully

the

put

it

out
of

this
suggests

that
there
be
considerable
pressure
from
the

a

to
be
suspicious
of
premature
exoneration
in
the

the
problem

eliminate

the

they

they
could
speak
freely
with
one
another
in

we
very
often
discuss
political
question
occasion
by
the
polish
evacuation
in
posen
in
the
persecution
of
the
jew
in
litzmannstadt
and
later
event
i
be
able
to
fnd
complete
agreement
with
herr
krause
in
our
view
with
respect
to
the
condemnation
of
national
socialist
method
especially
in
the
question
of
the
gestapo
terror
and
the
racial
theory
of
the
nsdap
thus
herr
krause
always
express
revulsion
over
the
treatment
of
the
jew
in
general
and
especially
in
the
former
district
of
the
wartheland
what
make
this
testimony
notable
be
that
klein
admit
that
they
both
be
aware
of
the
crime
be
commit
in
poland
indeed
the
later
event
could
only
mean
the
holocaust
this
be
not
knowledge
that
german
readily
confess
to
either
in

later

klein
could
easily
have
rest
with
a
re
counting
of
krause
s
good
deed
in
berlin
it

that

the

about

that

apparently
do
not
think

his

conclude
that
despite
his
extraordinary
intelligence
he
continue
to
hold
without
notic
ing
it
the
incomprehensible
idea
of

drumm

from

as
he
be
to
his

his

arendt
make
no
mention
whatever
of
his

or
his
desire
to

the
german
insurance
industry
from
the
clutch
of
schwede
coburg
and
the
publicly
charter

daf
company
rather
he
described
his
act
of
resis
tance
in
humane
and
political
term
undoubtedly
his
religious
engagement
and
the
traditionalist
sense
of
honor
and
responsibility
played
an
important
role
in
this
attitude
but
it
refected
a
markedly
different
self
understand
from
that
to
be
found
in
the
other
denazifcation
case
now
to

to

arendt
be
a

rank

with
direct
connection
to
many
of
the
person
involve
in
the

and
it
can
hardly
be
ex
pected
that

would
have

in
a

in
the

way
for
their
party
membership
and
public
support
of

apparently

if

however
his

have
certain
peculiarity
worth
note
on
the
one

he
claimed
that
he
be
under
great
pressure
from
the
company
nsbo
cell
in

which
warn
that

not

take
a
radical
turn
if
they
do

that

eberhard
rather
lamely
assert
that
this
be
the
large
such

in
south
germany
that
many
job
be

and
that

if

on
the

it

precisely
the

to
whom
eberhard
attribute
his

point
reinforce
by
a
letter
of

from

there
have
be
much
call

be

the

in

the

who
never

the

that
hindenburg

and
that

prove
crucial
in

along
with
the
fact
that
hitler
receive

recognition
both
schloe

admit
that
the

left

about

eberhard

that
the

suggest
that

then

without
inform

the

this
be
that
while

his
grow
disaffection
after
assume
the
post
of
economics
minister
in
the
last
analysis
the
simplest
explanation
for
eberhard
s
join
the

be
that
he
get
on
the
bandwagon
for
opportunistic
reason
along
with
a
host
of
other
businessmen
and
certainly
never

by
conviction
apparently
he
do
contemplate
leave

on

that

be
in
the
best
interest
of
the

and
also
a
way
to
prevent
radical
infuences
from
gain
hold
compare
to
the
painful
effort
and
gyration
of
eberhard
in
explain
his
party
membership
the
denazifcation
of
wilhelm
leicher
the
deputy
director
at
stuttgart
since
be
a
model
of
simplicity
itself
he
have
join
the

because
as
he
honestly
admit
he
believe
that
one
have
to
give
the
new
po
litical
movement
a
chance
to
prove
itself
subsequently
he
turn
against
the
party
and
could
provide
credible
testimony
that
he
have
help
jew
and
politi

opponent

have
criticize

the

you

out
the

be
not
ban
by
the

when
not
engage
in
his
company

he
be
deeply
involve
in
the
struggle
against
the
political
instrumentalization
of
the
publicly
charter

it
could
be
demonstated
that
he
be
one
of
the
chief
opponent
of

coburg
han
goebbels

and
that
he
provide

of
the
most
important
intellectual
ammunition
against
the
writing
of

what
he
defned

in

he

opponent

ask
by
the
nsdap
district
leader
to
join
the
party
in

and
though
he
agree
to
join
because
he
like
the

s
anti
depression
measure
and
the
break
of
the
rigid
system
of
collective
bargaining
contract
samwer
have
refrain
from
pursue
the
matter
until
when
he
found
it
politic
to
join
and
thus
re
duce
his
exposure
to
criticism
insofar
as
his
political
attitude
be
concerned
he
boast
of

out

order
i
still
try

diffculties

case

i
remember
in

a
mortgage
case
of
in
which
the
reich
try
to
get
us
to
renounce
a
personal
debt
liability
so
that
the
state
could
get
hold
of
the

in
question
i
refuse
to
do
so
what
be
signifcant
about
this
remark
be
not
that
it
refects
some
extraordinary
moment
in
the
protection
of
jewish
asset
rather
it
supply
evidence
that
at
least
this
insurance
industry
leader
be
prepared
not
only
to
comment
on
the
issue
but
also
to
suggest
that
it
be
indeed
possible
to
do
something
to
under
mine
the

although
samwer
be
willing
to
touch
on
the
jewish

question
where
he
seem
to
feel
he
have
a
clearer
conscience
he
studiously
avoid
any
mention
of
see

his
cultivation
of

robert

although
this
be
widely

that
insofar
as
he
maintain

it
be
for
the

at
the

he
willingly

considerable

his

as
if

for

recognition
while
samwer
have
to

to

toward

brought
by
ger
many
s
control
of

from

his

at
the
treatment
of

and
the

against
the
soviet

which
he
thought
would
lead

that
be
a

that
would
end
in

in

he
do
ad

to
take
a
more
positive
view
of
the

prior
to
primarily
because
of
the
economic
reconstruction
he
attribute
to
it
in
sum
samwer
present
himself
as
an
opponent
of
the
persecution
of
the
jew
and
other
designate
op
ponents
of

and
as
someone
who
cooperate
with
the

only
insofar
as
it
promise
economically
positive
result
and
promote
the
well
be
of
karlsruher
and
its

when
turn
to
his
role
in
the
rhein
und
mosel
affair
and
the
arrest
of
mouchard
however
samwer
claimed
that
he
do
all
he
could
to
beneft
the
company
place
under
his
trusteeship
and
that
mouchard
have
present
him
with
forge
document
claim
that
petain
have
confrmed
his
leadership
of
the
company
samwer
argue
that
he
have
no
choice
but
to
report
the
situation
to
the
authority
and
he
note
that
mouchard
be
eventually
release
and
held
a
high
position
in
the
vichy
regime
without
any
opposition
from
himself
there
be
no
record
of
what
hitzler
actually
thought
of
all
this
self
defense
but
he
respond
positively
to
samwer
as
a
person
point
out
that
the
insurance
business
need
active
and
energetic
individual
while
at
the
same
time
indicat
ing
that
he
could
do
nothing
for
him
since
the
british
tend
only
to
take
care
of
their
own
subject
except
for
person
come
from
the
soviet
zone
and
reject
licensing
person
from
the
american
and
french
zone
it
be
indeed
to
be
a
long
time
before
samwer
found
a
high
position
in
the
insurance
business
although
his
colleague
at
allianz
be
try
to
fnd
a
place
for
him
at
other
company
thus
in
august
allianz
general
director
han
hermann
goudefroy
be
pessimistic
about

s
chance
ultimately
samwer
climbed
back
up
the
ladder
in
politics
rather
than
in
business
a
rather
surprising
career
for
some
one
who
claimed
to
be
a
businessman
rather
than
a
politician
he
become
a
city
councilman
in
karlsruhe
a
member
of
the
constitutional
parliamentary
assembly
of

after

because
of
his
political

for

undoubtedly
do
have
some
of
the
requisite
quality
for

top
level
of
the

ap
pear
to
have
be
circuitous

it
suggests
that
among

there
be
a
certain
line
in
collaboration
that
be
not

samwer

cross

and
he
have

his
way

of
his

a
much

he

they

somewhat

about
his

the

quite

very
pragmat
ically
and
in
late
august
hilgard
urge
hitzler
to
take
charge
point
out
that
fundamentally
i
be
of
the
opinion
that
it
be
the
youth
insofar
as
it
be
available
and
suitable
that
must
go
to
the
front
now
hilgard
certainly
be
glad
to
provide
such
assistance
as
he
could
but
as
he
write
hitzler
everyone
who
know
the
huge
burden
that
have
be
upon
my
shoulder
over
the
year
will
em
pathize
with
the
fact
that
i
do
not
have
any
more
desire
to
step
into
the
public
limelight
hilgard
urge
that
step
be
take
in
the
direction
of
a
preliminary
organization
and
that
a
courier
service

establish

munich
so
as

in

british
zone
hitzler
do
indeed
help
to
create
a
preliminary
organization
and
in
september
held
a
meeting
among
the
insurer
in
hamburg
but
he
continued
to
feel
that
hilgard
have
the
confdence
of
the
insurance
indus
try
and
should
take
a
permanent
chairmanship
however
as
hilgard
explain
in
a
moody
letter
of
early
november
he
felt
bound
to
stay
near
his
family
because
of
the
insecurity
of
his
situation
and
also
because
every
far
activity
on
his
part
in
the
insurance
feld
depend
on
the
permission
of
the
military
au
thorities
indeed
hilgard
now
enter
the
gloomiest
chapter
of
his
career
his
denazifcation
a
time
of
the
great
personal
disappointment
and
most
painful
renunciation
shut
out
indeed
thrust
out
of
the

for
which
i
give
the
best

of
my
life
and
still
in
the
full
possession
of
my
mental
and
physical
capacity
i
have
to
stand
idly
by

observe
how
the
severely
injured

hilgard
have

the

from
baron

have
visit
him
in
irnberg
just
after
the
capitulation
and
who
thanks
to
his
con
nections
have
already

headquarters
in

where
he
have
stumble
upon
the

offce
hilgard
be
deeply
critical
of
the
process
not
only
with
respect
to
his
own
case
but
also
more
generally
and
certainly
many
of
his
criticism
be
well
found
denazifcation
varied
from
zone
to
zone
and
in
his
view
the
american
practice
be
especially
problematic
because
it
make
party
membership
the
touchstone
of
whether
or
not
to
launch
proceeding
it
thereby
overlook
the
fact
that
some
of
the
bad
culprit
be
not
party
member
and
operate
in
an
excessively
schematic
way
he
be
also
highly
critical
of
the
staffng
of
the
denazifcation
tribunal
as
exemplifed
in
his
own
case
by
the
frst
such
tribunal
to
hear
his
case
in
bad
aibling
whose
chair
man
be
subsequently
arrest

sent
to

on
moral
charge
and
by
the

in
the
second
tribunal
in
rosenheim
who
end
up
in
jail
for
embez
zlement
in
hilgard
s
view
the
presence
of
such
inferior
material
as
offcers
of
the
court
make
correct
judgment
especially
in
case
like
his
virtually
impos
sible
that
he
have
be
classifed
as
a
major
offender
i
e
place
in
category
i
undoubtedly
reinforce
such
feeling
especially

try

at

also

he
be
worried
about
be
arrest
again
at
the
time
of
his
interview
with

and
be
plead
that
his
swiss
friend
write
on
his

it
be
not
impossible
that
schmitt
exaggerated
the
condition
of
his
confnement
to
zwicky
in
order
to
increase
the
sympathy
of
his
swiss
col
league
at
the
same
time
there
be
good
evidence
that
his
actual
release
have
little
to
do
with
the
good
impression
he
supposedly
create
with
the
ameri

or
their
allege
belief
that
honorary
s

be
like
be
in
the

while
it
be
not
impossible
that
they
do
believe
this
and
be
extremely
stupid
it
be
far
more
likely
that
they
be
use
a
shrewd
interroga
tion
technique
there
be
nothing
more
apt
to
bring
out
schmitt
s
effusiveness
than
to
tell
him
that
he
have
do
nothing
wrong
and
that
one
have
complete
confdence
in
him
the
evidence
indicates
that
schmitt
be
actually
release

the
behest
of
his

apparently

schmitt

he

that
they

badly

that

confscation

cause
he
have
serve

schmitt
suggest
that
the

express
regret
about
these

since
he
have

then
provide

he
have

anti

finally
he
suggest
that
the

conclude
by
urge
him
not
to
despair
since
the
american
justice
system
function
well
and
would
certainly
do
what
be
right
schmitt
be
clearly
master
what
might

call
the

of
denazifca

as
he

master

his

that

aware

be
no

that

would
nevertheless
have
to
go
before

could

the

on
this
subject
in

to
solve
the

who
recognize
that
the

that
the

also
prepared
the
groundwork
for
mutual

and
collaboration
in
a
passage
remarkable
for
its
combination
of
fantasy
and
disingenuousness
schmitt
paint
his
picture
of
the
past
four
and
a
half
year
in
the
warm
possible
hue
as
a
farmer
in

i
saw
during
all
the
year
of
the

in
the
immediate
and
more
distant

thousand
of
foreign

prisoner

move
about
without
any
surveillance
who
as
industrious
and
reliable
worker
stood
behind
the

another

economic
cooperation
with
one
another
not
collaboration
not
egotistical
quest
for
proft
at
the
expense
of
an
exploit
rap
country
but
rather
sympathetic
mutual
cooperation
of
people
from
various
country
who
in
the
last
analysis
found
themselves
in
the

want

oppression

who
want
to
honorably
help
one
another

most

respect
one
another

terror
if
schmitt
be

maintain
such
notion
and
believe
that
he
have
some
thing
to
contribute
to
the
politics
of
reconstruction
and
endure
denazifcation
confdently
despite
his
bout
of
anxiety
then
it
be
not
only
because
of
his

also
because
of
an
infectious
personal
conviction

because
person
of
considerable
substance
reinforce
his
self
image
and
be
willing
to
bear
witness
on

a
good
illustration
of
both
the
positive
impression
schmitt
could
make
and
his
own
self
understand
be
an
interview
conduct
with
him
by
harry

i
come

of
the

his

suffer
from

i
have
the
impression

an
outspoken
anti
national
socialist
dr
kurt

give
me
the
impression
of
be
an
idealist
optimist
who
in
his
entire
career
as
be
so
often
the
case
perhaps
have
so
much
fortune
precisely
because
he
do
not
always
engage
in
sober
judgment
on
the
basis
of
the
real
fact
he
do
not
deny
his
part
in
the
collective
respon
sibility
of
the
german
people
but
answer
my
question
whether
he
feel
himself
in
any
way
guilty
negatively
and
this
with
an
unmistakable
sense
of
honesty
with
himself
in
that
he
point
out
the
condition
under
which
he
become
reich

that
he
turn
down
later
offer

that

it

standard

in

remarkable
that

should
praise

for
not

for
make
anti

comment
which
be
not
to
belittle
the
fact
that
he
do
make
such
comment
most
notable
in
this
respect
be
the
repeatedly
mention
concern
on
the
part
of
those
who
work
at
tiefenbrunn

be
personally
connect
with
schmitt
that
he
would
end
up
a
victim
of
his
own
effusiveness
owe
to
his
tendency
to
criticize
the
regime
rather
openly
there
also
could
be
no
question
about
the
fact
that
schmitt
have
help
and
employ
jew
half
jew
person
married
to
jew
and
political
opponent
of
the
regime
and
that
some
of
this
simply
could
not
be
hidden
from
the
nazi
most
impressive
however
be
the
detailed
letter
of
support
and
engagement
from
person
whose
testimony
could
certainly
not
be
treat
casually
one
of
these
be

base
on
their
long

in

in
which
he
described

as
what
we
in

would
call
a
liberal
or
perhaps
best
express
a
progressive
represen
tative
of
the

he
claimed
that
schmitt

warn

jeidels
have
be
a

and
praise
him
for

to
tame
the
movement
by
take
the
risk
of
become
economics

he
be
above
all
appreciative
of
schmitt
s
open
friendship
with
himself
a
jew
when
minister
and
after
he
left

he
described
their
common
effort
to
regulate

dessauer

and
to
keep

indeed
jeidels
saw
himself

schmitt
as
engage
in
a
common
struggle
before
jeidels
found
he
have
to

conclude
that
h

be
a
man
before
whom
i
take
off
my

in
thankfulness
and
high
esteem
and
to
whom
i
would
extend
the
hand
of

any
time
if
fate
give
me

jeidels

to
have
no
knowledge
of
schmitt
s
contact
with

but
he
must
have
be
well
aware
of
schmitt
s
public
support
of
the
regime
afterward
jeidels
be
obviously
prepared
to
discount
such
evidence
of
schmitt
s
engagement
and
give
more
credence
to
what
schmitt
say
in
private
and
the
way
he
behave

schmitt

the
protection

that
they
all

at

it
remind
him

talk
year

prior

for

then

necessary
for

niemler

argue
in
schmitt
s
view
that
the
entire

be
guilty
of

so
that

among

the

even
more
absurd
however
be
s
s
exculpation
of

and
suggestion
that
he
have
be
passive
in
the

nevertheless

schmitt

defense
and
not
only
by
arnhold
s
gen
tle
reminder
and
refection
but
by

interrogator

pointedly
question
schmitt
about
the
when
and
wherefore
of
schmitt
s
early
contact
with
ging
for
example
most
disturb
however
be
those
whom
schmitt
thought
be
personal
ally
but
who
remember
thing
he
do
not
one
of
these
be
the
allianz
director
walter
egger
who
insist
that
schmitt
s
frst
contact
with
ging
be
in
the
fall
of
and
that
schmitt
initially
be
en
thused
about
national
socialism
schmitt
s
response
to
this
be
to
suggest
to
their
common
interrogator
emil
lang
that
egger
be
most
defnitely
mistaken
and
be
perhaps
suffer
from
senility
a
claim
that
lang
brought
to
egger
s
unappreciative
attention
when
schmitt
try
contact
egger
in
late
through
the
latter
s
close
friend
director
ernst
justus
ruperti
to
see
if
he
could
not
persuade
egger
that
he
have
frst
met
ging
in
and
have
never
be
an
enthusiastic
nazi
egger
respond
that
it
would
be
shameful
for
him
not
to
tell
the
truth
and
that
if
summon
to
another
hearing
he
would
tell
the
truth
again
as
we
have
show
egger
have
indeed
told
the
truth
cruelest
however
be
the
blow
that
come
from
schmitt

thirty

certainly
he

that
schmitt
also
support
the
nonrenewal
of
he
s
contract
for
when
he
sought
to
remind
schmitt
of
this
fact
in
personal
conver
sation
schmitt
claimed
not
to
remember
he
then
suggest
to
schmitt
that
there
be
altogether
too
many
thing
that
schmitt
could
not
remember
as
he
told
goudefroy
his
successor
as
general
director
of
allianz
in
october
on
this
occasion
i
express
many
a
bitter
word
about
his
general
memory
weakness
of
the
nazi
period
although
i
have
for
year
let
his
protestation
which
contradict
the
truth
silently
pas
because
i
knew
the
distress
of
his
soul
and
do
not
want
to
increase
it
through
my
contradiction
so
among
other
thing
i
be
a
witness
to
an
incident
which
have
take
place
year
ago
in
tiefenbrunn
when
his
cousin
bohl
we
be
three
alone
in
a
room
together
in
the
course
of
conversation
in
his
quiet
manner
one
time
let
fall
the
remark
na
kurt
but
at
the
begin
you
also
be
enthuse
the
blood
rush
to
schmitt
s
face
he
sprang
up
with
a
fery
red
visage
hiss
at
his
cousin
and
immediately
left
the
room
and
that
in
the
presence
of
the
old
he
who
daily
experienced
all
the
thing
that
happen
and
kept
them
in
his
memory
in
all
their
detail
in
this
conversa
tion
with
schmitt
i
recall
into
memory
all
the
experience
relate
to
his
enthusiasm
and
he
do
not
have
the
courage
to
contest
them
whatever
the
complexity
of
the
mutually
painful
confict
between
he
and
schmitt
over
the
event
of
he
have
torn
away
the
veil
of
schmitt
s
selective
memory
and
obfuscation
about
his
real
culpability
schmitt
regularly
told
his
correspondent
that
it
be
important
never
again
to
follow
false
prophet
and
he
hardly
could
be
fault
for
this
sound
message
as
usual
with
schmitt
how
ever
it
be
an
evasion
of
the
deeper
issue
the
problem
be
not
simply
that
he
have
follow
a
false
prophet
but
that
he
have
sup
well
say
lunch
with
the
devil
and
have
for
a
considerable
time
do
so
with
a
rather
short
spoon
if
anything
he
be
a
false
prophet
or
at
least
false
apostle
himself
kurt
schmitt
be
after
all
the
most
prominent
insurance
executive
in
germany
and
exercise
immense
authority
and
infuence
not

over
his

over

of

schmitt
rightly

it
be
really
a
more
serious

to
make

that
contribute

of

from
this

the

program

the
terrible
personal
loss
suffer
by

it

anything

unjust
that
he
and
some
others
suffer
the
humiliation
of

force
to
defend
their
past
of
be
unable
to

their
profession
while
do
so

to

their

frozen
whether
a
personal
understand
of
the
responsibility
and
guilt
emerge
from
the
entire
experience
be
another
question
and
here
the
success
rate
be
undoubtedly
quite
low
if
existent
at
all
however
valid
some
of
the

may

an

both
in

by

it

sarcastically

insofar

there
have

on

it
have
come
from

deserve
some
credit
above

who
paid

he
meant

himself
a
more
serious
challenge
come
from
the
insurance
expert
ludwig
arp
who
bluntly
sug
gested
that
it
be
a
mistake
to
argue
that
the
takeover
in
the
occupy
area
be
all
force
upon
the
reinsurance
company
by
the
regime
when
challenged
by

to
support
this
claim
arp
produce
some
seventeen

untary

of
which
involve
the
munich
re
one
of
these
be
wiener
allianz

this
be
obviously
not
an
acquisition
force
upon
either
allianz

munich
re
but
rather
one
force
on
the
italian
and
austria
as
should
be
obvious
however
the
interest
here
be
not
historical
investigation
and
analy
si
but
a
self
generate
persilschein
that
would
legitimize
the
restoration
of
the
reinsurance
business
to
its
old
status
it
be
signifcant
that
the
reinsurers
be
confdent
they
could
call
on
the
service
of
lauinger
toward
this
end
if
there
be

then

insofar
as
its

defend

itself
to

abroad
that
restrict
itself
to
pure

it
have
thereby
fought
to
make
the
claim
after
the
fall

cialism
to
be
promote
rather
than
destroyed
by
the

whose
principle
base
in

cannot
be
deny
it
would
be
an
irony
of
fate
if
it
would
be
just
that
democracy
that
want
to
realize
the
national

that
will
destroy
it
the
intention
be
to
send
the
manuscript
to
the
occupation
authority
in
the
hope
that
it
would
infuence
them
against
socialization
and
so
like
the
meuschel
manuscript
it
be
circulate
for
critical
comment
quite
interest
in
this
regard
be
the
comment
of
director
han
knoll
of
knische
hagel
versicherungsgesellschaft
who
certainly
found
the
entire
effort
informative
and
laudable
but
nevertheless
could
not
but
help
feel
that
the
manuscript
make
a
great
effort
to
push
certain
person
go
through
denazifcation
into
the
back
ground
and
to
engage
in
an
all
too
zealous
vindication
of
them
he
found
it
noteworthy
that
the
allianz
group
be
scarcely
mention
and
while
other
person
be
identifed
with
their
company
schmitt
be
only
identifed
as
an
experienced
expert
or
someone
who
be
an
insurance
man
and
hilgard
be
only
once
mention
in
connection
with
allianz
but
regularly
identifed
with
the
reich
group
the
head
of
the
life
insurance
group
be
never
even
mention
by
name
although
it
happen
to
be
schloe
mann
of
allianz
leben
knoll
also
thought
that
the
case
would
appear
too
apologetic
because
the
profts
make
af
ter
be
not
mention
and
someone
be
bound
to
discover
not
only
the
fgures
but
also
the
praise
give
to
the
regime
for
cut
the
crime
rate
such
exercise
in
memory
however
be
rapidly
to
fade
in
importance
as
the
cold
war
undermined
the
interest
in
decartelization
and
socialization
and
as
currency
reform
create
a
foundation
for
recovery
break
up
the
insur
ance
concern
never
have
the
urgency
it
have
in
industry
or
in
banking
for
the
ally
where
it
be
not
very
successful
either
and
socialization
be
not
really
a
serious
threat
except
perhaps
in
hesse
where
there
be
a
strong
movement
for
socialization
this
be
one
of
the
reason
that
allianz
decide
in

set
up

if

nevertheless

at

view

the

that
happen
to
have

but
this
be
hardly
surprising
the
correspondence
show
that
allianz
be
able
to
acquire
his
portfolio
well
below
its
worth
and
that
it
paid
him
a
low
settlement
whatever
the
case
there
be
no
record
of

it
be
most
unlikely
he
would
have
do
so
with
much
success
under
the
ex
isting

give
the
record
present
here
however
the
case
certainly
would
have
end
up
in
the
court
and
allianz
might
have
be
willing
to
come
to
a
settlement
restitution
and
compensation
for
aryanizations
of
real

and

allianz
face
what
be
probably
its
most
serious
restitution
problem
in
the
area
of
aryanized
real
estate
and
the
record
often
speaks
poorly
for
the
man
ner
in
which
the
concern
dealt
with
claimant
and
even
more
negatively
with
respect
to
its
attitude
toward
them
this
be
not
to
say
that
judging
each
indi
vidual
case
an
impossibility
here
would
be
a
simple
matter
most
diffcult
undoubtedly
be
the
case
of
mortgage
foreclosure
and
force
sale
especially
when
they
take
place
in
the
early

of
some
of
these
case
by

seem
very
dis
turbing
today
a
reveal

that
the

in

that
the

give

so
since
the

they

the

therefore
be
justifed

nothing
to

with

be
a

if
allianz
have
give

it
could

that
the

not

that

have

ironically
some
of

that
this
be
true
those
in
charge
of
deal
with

mortgage
at

in
the

may
have

more
sensitive

yet
we
have
already
see
that

could
make
little
claim
to
sensitivity
in
the
aryanizations
of
the

the

be
seemingly
well
aware
of
the
brutality
show
to
the

in

the

illustrate

upkeep

thereafter
lead

chronic

even
before

to
argue
that
the
even

purchase
of
the
property
by

in
from
a
person
notorious
for
buying
up

demonstrate
that

have
played
a

however
allianz

successfully
that
even
non

ing
from
such
chronic
indebtedness
would
have
lose
their

under

a
conclusion

also
by

again
in
in
the
latter
trial
the
lawyer
for
the
now
widowed
cirl
tennenbaum
try
to
argue
on
the
basis
of
a
high
court
decision
in
another
case
of
force
sale
that
there
be
an
entitlement
to
restitution
because
it
be
impossible
for
jew
to
get
credit
in

but
the
restitution
court
hearing
the
ten

case
point
out
in
its
decision
that
the
force

in

take
place
in
that
be
four
year
later
when
condition
be
dramatically
more
unfavorable
for

and
thus
there
could
be
no
question
about
the
in
capacity
of
the
owner
in
that
case
to
pay

this

it

worth
note
that
this

demonstrates
what
a

be
for

structure
there
be
anything
but
reconciliation
however
in
the
case
of
ludwig

a
jewish
businessman
who
have
fed
to
rio

he
built
an
especially
attractive
house
for
himself
and
his
family

that
would

take
out
with
karlsruher

which
belong
to
the
allianz
concern
from
allianz
s
standpoint
jansen
have
receive
a
fair
price
especially
since
it
have
bought
the
property
from
a
jewish
real
estate
agent
and
the
sale
be
not
make
under
duress
jansen
saw
the
matter
differently
re
membering
that
director
maiholzer
have
told
him
that
jew
should
take
what
they
could
get
under
the
cirumstances
and
that
he
subsequently

allianz
be
much
more
resistant
however
to
accept
the
claim
of
jew

in
connection
with

anything
but
the
unwilling
participant
that
its

would
suggest
in
the
realization
of
these
megalomaniacal
scheme
contrary
to

s
pretension
the
jew

sizeable
enough
to
merit
a
friendly
visit
to

neumann
by
the
chairman
of

in
the
early
s
allianz
s
response
to
the

be
to
declare
and
it
must
be
say
with
a
disingenuousness
that
border
on
the
repulsive
that
it
certainly
still
held
the
share
that
it
have
bought
from
merck

in

and
knew
that
they
have

that
the
reason
why
these
have
be
sell
be
unknown
to
us
however
its
chief
argument
against
the
newman
claim
be
that
the
share
in
question
which
have
to
bear
a
name

even
if

be
subject

allianz
have
no

it
certainly
could
not
argue
that

would
have
sell
the

if
the
condition
create
by
national
socialism
have
not

it
and
the

situation
have
not
become
hopeless
also
as
the

argue
there
be
good
political
reason

also

the

of

be
reduce
to
aware
that
court
decision
might
prove
unfavorable
to
their
position
allianz
then
offer
to
value
the

at
the
average
quotation
of
dm
each
which
would
have
amount
to
dm
and
then
settle
for
less
than
half
this
amount
namely
dm
it
would
appear
that
the
trusteeship
administration
be
in
the
end
prepared
to
accept
dm
but
the
federal
supervisory
offce
for
insurance
refuse
to
approve
the
settlement
on
the
ground
that
the
court
be
still
consider
the
share
in
question
to
be
bearer
share
not
subject
to

in
reality
allianz
itself
have
little
to
lose
since
under
exist
legislation
allianz
would
then
be
substantially
compensate
for
its
settlement
by
the
state
of
bavaria
whose
government
as
shall
be
explain
more
fully
be
guarantee
the
liability
of
the
insurance
company
at
the
end
of
allianz
propose
a
settlement
of
dm
and
believe
it
would
be
possible
to
gain
approval
of
the
supervisory
offce
for
this
sum
but
the
super
visory
offce
contend
that
allianz
would
only
get
dm
back
from
the
bavarian
state
and
would
thus
lose
dm
which
in
their
view
constitute
an
unfair
hardship
for
the
concern
state
guarantee
of
the
insurance
company

bl
have
be
base
on
the
premise
that
they
be
technically
bankrupt
which
they
have
be
at
the
end
of
the
war
thus
on
the
one
hand
the
bavarian
govern
ment
be
cover
at
least
a
portion
of
their
restitution
cost
while
on
the
other
it
take
the
view
that
loss
incur
by
allianz
be
unaffordable
this
be
not
in
fact
the
view
held
by
allianz
which
thought
that
the
amount
in
question
could
easily
be
absorbed
the
supervisory
offce
then
give
permission
for
the
settlement
to
go
forward
what
be
one
to
make
of
this
case
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
be
a
good
demonstration
of
how
and
why
some
of
these
restitution
case
drag
on
for
as
long
as
they
do
to
begin
with
it
take
seven
year
be
fore
the
trusteeship
fnally
act
it
then
prove
diffcult
to
determine
in
certain
case
who
be
a
jew
and
who
be
not
furthermore
in
this
instance
it
could
well
be
argue
that
some
of
the
share
end
up
in
the
allianz
portfolio
through
normal
trading
obviously
the
lack
of
clarity
about
the
legal
situation
serve
to
diminish
the
settlement
amount
but
no
less
signifcant
be
that
the
federal
su
pervisory
offce
played
a
substantial
role
in
reduce
the
settlement
even
to
the
point
where
allianz
itself
felt
compel
to
say
that
enough
be
enough
matter
be
much
simpler
in
other
case
where
the
clear
liability
of

be
unquestionable

and
purchase

be
restitute
since
the
name
be
know
to

and
since
the
share

in
be
clearly
alienate

of
all
be
the

of

de
nederlanden
van
which
allianz
have
bought

through

these

the

therefore
turn

fnal
area

relevant
to
this

namely
property

above
all
life

the
question
of
insurance

in

claim

at

the
only
signifcant
area
that
come
up
with
respect
to

be
the
damage

to
jewish

during
the

of
november
allianz
s
position
as
can
be
imagine

that
it
have
no
liability
since
payment
for

from
the
insurance
the
number
of
claim
that
pour
in
to
the
various
insurer
cause
a
considerable
amount
of
worry
so
that
as
early
as
the
summer
of
the
property
insurer
ask
for
a
legal
opinion
from
a
major
lawyer
in
cologne
who
affrmed
in
the
strong
possible
term
that
the
insurance
condition
preclude
coverage

in

that

against

down
beautiful
germany

a
large
portion
of
the
world
into
mass
misery
and
mi
fortune
she
consider
it
scandalous
that
someone
like
hilgard
should
still
have
a
high
position
in
the
company
and
she
demand
that
her
claim
should
therefore
be
grant
and
what
she
consider
the
purely
formal
argument
of

reject
in
any
case
she
intend
to
fght

for
principled
reason

to
demonstrate
for
all
to
see
how
restitution
for
the
jew
be
be
handle
in
germany
manifestly
this
be
not
a
very
compelling
legal
argument
and
the
real
test
of
the
adequacy
of
restitution
would
be
the
success
of
her
claim
not
against
allianz
but
rather
against
the
government
one
suspect
however
that
the
emo
tions
refected
by
her
remark
be
widespread
and
help
to
explain
the
insistence
of
many
jewish
claimant

take
their

as
have

show
the
performance
of
hilgard
and

allianz

in
the

be
often
morally
deplorable
but
this
do
not
make
it
actionable
it
be
thus
hard
to
fault
the
basic
position
of

and
the
other

that
in
view
of
the
nuremberg
trial
evidence
on
the
pogrom
the
responsibility
for
the
damage

indeed
the

go
so

as
to

that
it

of

that

that
its

in
conformity

that

have
the
choice

either
accept

refuse
it
and
wait
for
a
regulation
of

right
in

it

interest
that
the
policyholder
himself
could
not

fne
a
reasonable
relation

the

indeed
while
the
american
demand

they
also

this

insistent
that

deserve
and
have
to

and
that
this

be

as
rapidly
as
possible
at
the

time
the
fnancial
burden

this

however
ought
not
to

on

not
to

the
persecutory
measure
under
which
many
of

have
to
suffer
they
abhor
these
measure
and
do
nothing
by
themselves
to
promote
them
but
they
could
just
as
little
ward
them
off

more
than

therefore
also

indeed
the

drew
up
a
draft
for
the
implementation
of
section
in
in

the
coordination
bureau
of
the
interministerial
work
ing

for

and

question
of
the

set
up
a

to
work
on
these
question
and
be
also
charge
to
do
so
in
consultation
with
the
association
of
german
life
insurer
it
move
very
slowly
however
in
part
because
its
chairman
ministerial
director
heiland
of
the
baden
finance
ministry
be
appoint
to
the
federal
consti
tutional
court
so
that
numerous
technical
question
continued
to
remain
open
at
the
end
of
initially
for
example
the
insurance
company
thought
that
government
compensation
could
be
use
not
simply
to
restore
insurance
right
as
some
sort
of
useful
fction
but
actually
to
enable
the
claimant
to
choose
to
revive
the
policy
on
a
dm
basis
that
be
assume
the
policy
have
not
come
to
term
the
former
policyholder
would
become
a
policyholder
once
again
by
use
compen
sation
monies
to
pay
the
premium
and
keep
the
policy
go
ultimately
the
opening
of
such
an
option
be
consider
too
complicate
but
it
be
illustrative
of
the
technical
issue
that
have
to
be
face
a
more
basic
problem
as
the
insur
ance
organization
justifably
argue
be
the
need
for
regulation
of
the
matter
at
the
federal
level
so
that
there
would
be
uniformity
and
consistency
of
practice
the
diffculty
here
be
that
all
issue
of
restitution
and
compensation
remain
a
special
reserve
of
the
occupation
power
even
after
the
establishment
of
the
federal
republic
so
that
the
west
german
government
have
frst
to
develop
the
basic
principle
under
which
it
would
regulate
these
question
and
then
secure
allied
agreement
ultimately
this
come
about
in
the
wake
of
the
luxemburg
agreement
between
germany

in
and
the
federal

the

up
in

under

no

not

for

on
the
day
the

due

the

in
the

from
that
present
here

in
this

view
as
a
lose

be
an
arguable
point

it
certainly
have
cease

in
it
must
also
be
say
to
the
credit
of
the
present
leadership
of
allianz
that
some
of
its

have
be
very
unhappy
about
the
superfcial
treatment

also
inevitably
a
most
un

perhaps
this
could

be
do
by

young

recent
revelation
about
the
past
of
prominent
german
historian
and
other
professional
who
face
no
lawsuit
and
be
anything
but
globalize
have
also
demonstrate
that
germany
s
business
enterprise
be
not
alone
in
the
slowness
with
which
they
confront
the
past
as
well
as
in
the
need
for
a
measure
of
external
and
public
pressure
to
force
them
to
do
so
historian
can
no
more
evade
the
public
controversy
involve
in
this
study
than
can
businessmen
it
would
be
improper
to
conclude
this
study
without
say
something
about
the
issue
to
which
it
owes
its
existence
the
question
of
unpaid
jewish
insurance
policy
for
reason
involve
the
manner
in
which
german
jew
be
despoil
and
the
way
in
which
restitution
be
organize
it
be
most
unlikely
that
signifcant
life
insurance
asset
remain
unpaid
allianz
and
other
german
insurance
company
have
no
interest
in
hiding
them
since
the
bill
would
be
paid
by
the
government
anyway
obviously
every
effort
should
be
make
to
satisfy
unmet
claim
that
be
justifed
but
the
search
for
unpaid
policy
should
be
subject
to
cost
beneft
consideration
above
all
in
consider
ation
of
the
need
of
survive
victim
of
national
socialism
in
eastern
europe
also
insurance
asset
be
differently
treat
in
different
national
venue
and
it
be
important
not
to
lump
together
truly
unpaid
insurance
asset
in
the
former
communist
country
once
held
by
italian
or
even
german
company
whose
holding
be
nationalize
with
the
policy
of
german
or
former
german
cit
izens
held
by
german
or
non
german
company
operating
in
germany
it
be
understandable
that
lawyer
concentrate
on
what
be
actionable
rather
than
on
what
be
simply
awful
the
latter
seem
to
be
the
province
of
the
historian
and
as
this
study
have
try
to
show
allianz
and
its
leader
be
implicate
in
various
way
in
the
evil
of
the
nazi
regime
there
be
certainly
much
bad
compa
ny
and
businessmen
but
the
allianz
of
today
have
at
least
be
proactive
and
take
a
lead
role
in
face
the
moral
issue
involve
and
in
deal
with
the
social
responsibility
arise
from
them
restitution
and
compensation
must
nevertheless
come
to
their
inevitable
closure
but
the
history
discuss
here
and
in
other
study
deal
with
the
national
socialist
period
should
remain
open
to
future
correction
and
refection
and
thus
to
inclusion
as
part
of
both
corporate
and
general
history
this
be
not
to
say
that
the
event
of
can
or
should
be
historicized
the
twelve
year
reign
of
national
socialism
be
and
hopefully
will
remain
a
unique
descent
into
barbarism
by
a
highly
advanced
industrial
society
the
most
depress
fnding
of
this
book
be
that
the
german
business
community
of
which
the
insurance
business
be
a
vital
member
not
only
fail
to
defend
civ
ilized
value
but
all
too
often
actively
engage
in
their
destruction
this
begin
even
before
the
national

sent

assumption

the

his
adoption
of

his

his
willingness
to
violate
basic
prin
ciples
of
liberal
economics

accept
state
direction
of
the

his
participation
in
the
imperialist
ambition
of
the
third

during
the

in

a
great
deal
more
than
prevent
the
bad
perhaps
that
be
the
way
he
felt
after
a
hard
day
of
run
from

to
ministry
and
deal
with
people
like
schwede
coburg
and
it
certainly
be
the
way
he
felt
after

the
truth
be
that
hilgard
s
be
an
extraordinarily
skillful
effort
to
conduct
interest
group
politics
under
the
stressful
condition
of
national
socialist
rule
and
that
this
effort
have
little
or
no
moral
content
the
leadership
of
allianz
be
not
not
rabid
anti
semite
but
they
be
suf
fciently
anti
semitic
to
approve
of
early
national
socialist
measure
and
then
to
put
up
relatively
little
resistance
as
the
regime
increase
its
persecution
of
the
jew
as
the
event
surround
the
pogrom
of
november
demonstrate
little
remain
of
business
ethic
when
it
come
to
the
treatment
of
jew
and
thus
the
way
be
pave
for
active
participation
in
the
despoliation
of
jew
include
jew
who
work
for
the
concern
in
the
aryanization
process
various
act
of
genuine
decency
and
of
assistance
to
jew
on
the
part
of
allianz
executive
such
as
han
he
and
offcials
notwithstanding
nazi
germany
have
turn
anti
semitism
into
a
national
and
international
endeavor
in
which
allianz
be
come
a
participant
its
role
in
lodz

in
insure
s
factory
be
the
end
result
of
a
process
that
begin
at
restaurant

of
course
those
who
lunch
with
ging
do
not
want
and
could
not
have
imagine
what
national
socialism
would
bring
but
they
also
fail
to
ac
knowledge
their
engagement
and
responsibility
after
it
have
all
take
place
the
pretension
of
allianz
and
of
the
german
business
community
generally
after
that
they
be
victim
of
national
socialism
be
truly
appal
and
it
infect
the
postwar
restitution
effort
as
well
there
be
of
course
no
reason
why
corporation
and
businessmen
should
be
well
than
the
society
of
which
they
be
a
part
and
there
be
nothing
particularly
unique
about
their
attitude
in
postwar
germany
they
be
certainly
not
the
last
group
in
german
society
that
need
to
own
up
to
its
past
nevertheless
capitalist
institution
and
those
who
guide
them
do
have
a
special
responsibility
in
society
organize
on
the
basis
of
private
property
and
liberal
economic
principle
this
be
a
responsibility
that
they
not
only
fail
to
meet
but
also
betrayed
under
national
socialism
as
this
book
have
try
to
show
the
question
be
not
merely
a
matter
of
survival
in
a
totalitarian
state
since
this
survival
involve
a
mixture
of
willing
participation
and
spineless
conformism
of
narrow
professionalism
and
self
interested
pursuit
of
proft
and
above
all
of
opportunism
it
would
be
unhistorical
and
unrealis
tic
to
expect
businessmen
to
have
be
resistance
leader
and
wilhelm
arendt
become
one
only
as
a
high
offcer
in
the
german
military
but
as
his
case
and
those
of
han
he
and
johannes
tiedke
demonstrate
it
be
possible
to
set
limit
to
one
s
engagement
with
the
regime
of
course
more
than
such
distanc
ing
be
need
since
what
be
totally
lack
be
a
commitment
to
democratic
value
