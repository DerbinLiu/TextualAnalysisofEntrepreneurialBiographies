he
rode
to

on
the
back
of
woman

compulsion
to
beautify
themselves
unlike

however
neither
his

familiar
to
those
who

shun
personal
publicity
so
remove
be
he
from

indeed
that
when
his

die
and
he
wish
to
remarry
the
only
woman
he
could
find

rubinstein
s
in
the
normal
way
of
thing
the
takeover
would
have
go
unnoticed
except
in
the
business
press
but
rubinstein
be
a
jew
while
schueller
during
the
german
occupation
have
be
a
lead
fascist
collaborator

although
they
never
met
during
their
lifetime
and
both

be
long
dead
the
consequence
of
this
potentially
lethal
opposition
outlive
them
the
conjunction
lead
to
a
series
of
scandal
that
not
only
threw
a
new
and
sinister
light
on
l
or
al
but
threaten
the
reputation
of
some
of
france

most
powerful
men
up
to
and
include
its
president
himself
it
may
seem
odd
certainly
unexpected
that
a
history
of
the
beauty
business
should
include
an
excursion
into
fascist
politics

always
be
a
political
hot

after
a
century
of

reassuringly
solid

madame
always
favor
this
surge
of
empowerment
and
since
empowerment
be
the
keynote
too
of
her
own
personal
story
nothing
could
be
more
appropriate
than
that
the

by
herself
in
two

be
a
fairy
tale
in
yet
another
sense
a
desirable
fiction
that
have
little
to
do
with
reality
i
have
always
felt
a
woman
have
the
right
to
treat
the
subject
of
her
age
with
ambiguity
until
perhaps
she
pass
into
the
realm
of
over
ninety
she
write
she
herself
be
by
then
well
into
that
realm
and
ambiguous
she
be
and
remain
not
just
about
her
age
but
about
every
aspect
of
her
life
although
in
the
year
of
her
death
she
finally
acknowledge
she
be
born
in

early

even
then
she
maintain
the
story

have
perhaps
come
to
believe
it
that
the

have
be
well
off

this
clearly
be
clever

cramped

frantic
life
amid
an
ever
increase

it
be
enough
to
put
any
intelligent
girl
off
marriage
and
motherhood
for
life
and
judging
by
her
later
foray
into
those
territory
this
be
just
the
effect
it
have
on
chaja
it
can
be
no
coincidence
that
the
only
krakow
suitor
she
mention
with
enthusiasm
be
not
a
possible
prospect
as
he
be
not
a
jew
come
from
a
family
like
the
rubinstein
to
marry
out
would
have
be
equivalent
to
death
have
chaja
do
so
they
would
have
cut
off
all
contact
with
her
and
recite
funeral
prayer
instead
her
father
produce
a
suitable
widower
chaja
refuse
him
there
be
an
almighty
row
and
she
left
the

never
to

she
take

reflect
her
attitude
toward
the
prescribed
female
life

would

until

her

she
described
herself
as
shy
a
quality
hard
to
reconcile
with
her
singularly
uninhibited
approach
to
business
and
her
constant
entertain
the
difficulty
however
seem
largely
to
have
arisen
from
her
awkwardness
in

she
uttered
in
grunt
fashion
writer
ernestine
carter
recall
a
strange
mix
of
english
french
polish
and
yiddish
that
make
her
hard
to
follow
and
reluctant
to
strike
up
conversation
with
stranger
surround
herself
with
family
as
she
famously
do
call
in

the

expand
she
carry
her

with
her
whether

london
the
archetypical
rootless
cosmopolitan
she
endure
coleraine
for
three
year
then
have
picked
up
enough
english
to
operate
independently
she
decide
it
be
time
to
make
her
escape
revisit
australia
in
she
refuse
to
set
foot
in
coleraine
no
no
i
don
t
want
to
go
back
there
she
told
patrick
o
higgins
the
aide
and
companion
of
her
later
year
for
what
i
be
hungry
lonely
poor
in
that
awful
place
but
the
coleraine
year
have
not
be
waste
she
knew
now
that
she
want
to
start
up
a
business
and
knew
too
what
that
business
would
be
one
reason
she
be
so
convincing
a
beauty
counselor
be
that
her
exquisite
complexion
meant
she
do
for
a
long
time
look
much
young
than
her
real
age
this
be
unusual
in
australia
whose
harsh
climate
with
its
strong
wind
and
baking
sun
be
hard
on
the
skin
her
weather
beaten
neighbor
be
admire
what
be
her
secret
helena
claimed
to
have
begin
by
sell
her
own
spare
pot
of
face
cream
to
the
local
lady
tell
them
that
she
use
a
formula
discover
by
some
brother
call
lykusky
who
have
supply
us
with
it
for
our
personal
use
ever
since
i
be
a
little
girl
when
the
supply
be
exhaust
the
legend
go
she
sent
off
to
poland
to
replenish
her
supply
this
be
on
every
level
a
fantasy
the
voyage
between
europe
and
australia
take
forty
five
day
far
too
slow
if
order
have
to
be
fulfil
and
it
be
unlikely
that
her
own
initial
supply
would
have
provide
any
surplus
but
for
a
natural
entrepreneur
like
helena
her
neighbor
interest
be
enough
to
plant
an
idea
the
idea
she
have
be
look
for
ever
since
abandon
her
father
s
house
and
the
narrow
life
it
offer
she
would
start
a
business
sell
face
cream
this
chance
direction
be
helena
s
first
great
stroke
of
luck
in
all
other
area
of
commerce
woman
be
at
a
disadvantage
but
the
beauty
business
be
different
with
odd
exception
such
as
the
french
court
of
louis
xv
where
everyone
male
and
female
whiten
their
face
as
a
sign
that
they
do
not
lead
a
low
class
outdoor
life
and
rouge
their
cheek
and
lip
the
misogynistic
christian
world
have
frown
upon
cosmetic
even
where
as
in
restoration
england
they
be
widely
use
even
when
everyone
knew
that
woman
do
use
rice
powder
or
face
cream
or
rouge
or
whiten
their
skin
with
the
notorious
and
poisonous
ceruse
make
from
white
lead
these
preparation
still
have
to
be
obtain
discreetly
and
apply
in
strict
privacy
men
avert
their
eye
from
such
arrangement
and
so
fail
to
realize
what
be
obvious
to
helena
rubinstein
that
half
the
human
race
be
interested
in
what
she
have
to
sell
indeed
long
after
helena
rubinstein
elizabeth
arden
and
est
e
lauder
have
all
make
million
out
of
cosmetic
men
remain
noticeably
absent
from
the
beauty
business
there
be
max
factor
but
his
main
specialty
be
stage
makeup
although
he
do
introduce
a
line
of
cosmetic
to
the
public
in
otherwise
until
the
arrival
of
charles
revson
s
revlon
in
the
s
woman
entrepreneur
dominate
the
beauty
scene
this
be
partly
because
as
life
magazine
observe
in
most
men
do
not
find
an
atmosphere
conducive
to
their
best
work
in
the
tight
little
matriarchy
of
the
beauty
business
a
business
madame
described
in
as
work
for
woman
with
woman
and
give
that
which
only
woman
can
give
an
intimate
understand
of
feminine
need
and
feminine
desire
but
the
prospect
of
enormous
profit
be
generally
enough
to
overcome
any
squeamishness
or
uncertainty
what
give
woman
the
edge
in
the
beauty
industry
be
that
in
the
begin
at
least
this
be
a
huge
potential
market
of
which
only
woman
be
aware
helena
decide
to
start
her

in

in
her
second
stroke
of
luck
it
prove
to
be
an
uniquely
propitious
location
for
what
she
now
propose
whether
or
not
australian
men
disapprove
of
makeup
be
of
little
interest
to
australian
woman
for
unlike
european
they
do
not
depend
on
men
for
their
money
in

however
be
mostly
semi
amateur
and
hand
to

not
at
all
the
kind
of
business
helena
have
in
mind
but
proper
business
start
ups
need
capital
and
in
australia
as
throughout
the
british
empire
no
woman
could
take
out
a
bank
loan
under
her
own
name
to
start
a
serious
business
meant
find
someone
to
underwrite
her
in
her
unreliable
memoir
write
sixty
year
later
helena
identify
her
maecenas
as
a
miss
helen
macdonald
a
friend
she
have
make
on
board
ship
when
she
come
to
australia
far
from
wealthy
but
she
insist
upon
lending
me
part
of
her
life
saving
the
two
hundred
and
fifty
pound
i
would
need
to
start
my
venture
in
fact
no
such
person
appear
on
the
relevant
passenger
list
in
another
account
she
suggest
that
a
coleraine
friend
come
with
her
to
melbourne
and
take
a
half
share
in
the
business
the
offer
be
decline
surely
one
of
the
bad
business
decision
in
history
but
perhaps
it
be
this
friend
who
contribute
the
money
whatever
its
provenance
the
be
forthcoming
it
be
the
only
money
helena
rubinstein
ever
borrow
now
all
that
remain
be
to
create
a
product
and
sell
it
the
first
thing
be
to
learn
if
she
do
not
already
know
it
the
simple
knack
of
make
face
cream
by
emulsify
lanolin
and
add
essential
plant
oil
to
disguise
its
unpleasant
sheepy
smell
some
year
later
she
would
instruct
her
london
manageress
in
this
process
with
a
recipe
for
make
blackhead
cream
take
one
pint
of
oil
put
it
into
a
white
basin
and
take
four
pint
of
peroxyde
percent
and
add
to
the
oil
or
rather
the
foundation
but
you
must
do
it
very
slowly
you
will
spoil
it
if
you
put
in
much
at
a
time
you
just
add
a
little
by
little
to
the
oil
and
stir
the
whole
time
stir
with
a
knife
the
less
peroxyde
you
put
in
at
a
time
the
well
and
thicker
it
will
get
add
a
little
rise
geranium
to
perfume
also
mix
essential
oil
be
expensive
violet
perfume
cost
a
kilo
more
expensive
than
diamond
and
pearl
but
a
little
go
a
long
way
anyone
who
have
make
mayonnaise
will
recognize
the
method
and
indeed
helena
rubinstein
always
refer
to
her
workbench
as
her
kitchen
she
adore
prepare
cream
and
lotion
and
her
kitchen
remain
the
place
she
be
always
happiest

one
of

early
discovery
be
that

high

do
not
deter

contrary
if

for
the
come
decade
be
set
constant
journey
and
an
uneasy
juggling
of
her
personal
and
business
life
helena
rubinstein
s
marriage
to
edward
titus
might
have
be
design

those
who

course
it
be
no
new
thing
for
wife
to
be
richer
than
their
husband
but
until
now
those
wife
and
their

bolster

than
challenged

be
something
else
a
novelty
and
not
necessarily
an
agreeable
one
psychologically
what
be
the
role
of
such
a
person
s
husband
whether
consort
or
housekeeper
it
be
quite
evidently
subordinate
even
now
not
easy
for
many
and
particularly
hard
in
a
culture
where
men
have
always
be
in
charge
when
titus
propose
he
talk
about
the
business
he
and
helena
would
build
together
but
the
business
be
entirely
hers
and
always
would
be
he
claim
partnership
in
everything
but
everybody
know
he
have
no
claim
to
anything
she
complain
in
put
like
that
her
attitude
sound
selfish
but
have
the
situation
be
the
more
usual
one
where
the
business
belong
to
the
husband
there
would
not
have
be
and
probably
still
would
not
be
any
question
of
the
wife
claim
partnership
as
of
right
it
be
only
because
titus
be
a
man
that
he
felt
it
his
due
nor
do
the
situation
improve
when
helena
officially
put
him
on
the
payroll
he
earn
his
salary
he
have
a
way
with
word
never
her
forte
and
be
good
at
advertising
but
he
hat
the
work
and
the
lack
of
independence
affront
his
self
esteem
hers
meanwhile
be

despite

schueller
the
self
make
man
set
about
design
a
new
improve
capitalism
his
sense
that
the
old
model
be
fail
crystallize
during
the
s
in
at
the
height
of
the
great
inflation
he
make
a
trip
to
germany
where
l
or
al
have
open
an
agency
and
felt
for
the
first
time
that
the
world
have
veer
off
track
three
year
later
in
france
it
veer
off
again
almost
as
catastrophically
though
in
the
opposite
direction
as
the
franc
be
revalue
factory
full
of
order
be
go
day
and
night
and
suddenly
customer
stop
order
a
month
later
they
wouldn
t
even
take
delivery
of
stuff
that
be
already
in
the
pipeline
and
i
have
to
close
two
out
of
three
factory
one
day
he
realize
that
with
modern
machine
he
could
double
production
use
only
half
his
exist
workforce
but
if
only
half
the
previous
number
of
worker
be
earn
salary
who
would
be
there
to
buy
the
good
then
he
have
a
revelation
if
salary
be
double
along
with
production
there
would
still
be
buyer
capitalist
have
to
realize
that
they
should
stop
lower
price
while
try
to
maintain
their
profit
by
cut
salary
too
on
the
contrary
what
they
need
to
do
be
not
low
price
but
raise
salary
not
in
an
unplanned
way
as
when
worker
demand
and
threaten
and
employer
give
in
but
mathematically
raise
them
as
production
increase
the
trick
be
to
raise
buying
power
not
low
price
lower
price
would
never
absorb
overproduction
because
it
be
impossible
ever
to
low
them
enough
over
the
next
few
year
schueller
work
out
his
economic
theory
he
first
expound
them
in
a
speech
to
old
sainte
croix
pupil
in
later
publish
as
an
article
in
the
sainte
croix
de
neuilly
magazine
the
article
create
such
a
stir
that
he
be
encourage
to
spread
the
word
wider
which
he
do
at
two
meeting
of
industrialist
later
in
he
publish
a
journal
l
action
patronale
in
which
employer
be
exhort
to
social
reform
finally
he
set
out
his
program
in
two
book
le
deuxi
me
salaire
the
second
salary
write
in
and
publish
in
and
la
r
volution
de
l
conomie
publish
in
what
be
need
he
be
convince
be
a
new
formula
for
pay
worker
they
would
receive
their
salary
as
usual
at
the
end
of
each
month
but
this
basic
pay
would
not
be
their
only
pay
in
his
own
industry
he
reckon
that
salary
should
amount
to
percent
of
the
product
s
factory
gate
sell
price
if
at
the
end
of
the
month
percent
of
total
receipt
amount
to
more
than
the
total
of
the
worker
agree
upon
basic
salary
the
difference
would
be
paid
out
to
the
worker
apportion
accord
to
their
individual
work
record
thus
the
second
salary
this
system
would
have
several
advantage
of
which
the
first
and
most
important
be
that
worker
instead
of
spending
the
day
watch
the
clock
would
work
hard
because
they
would
benefit
personally
if
the
business
flourish
he
himself
schueller
say
have
spent
a
good
deal
of
his
youth
perform
boring
manual
task
and
recognize
that
the
reason
this
have
never
bother
him
be
because
unlike
most
worker
he
have
always
even
when
he
be
very
young
be
work
for
his
own
benefit
rather
than
an
employer
s
of
course
few
young
men
be
as
driven
as
he
have
be
nevertheless
the
second
salary
would
make
every
worker
a
stakeholder
in
his
own
factory
it
would
also
schueller
thought
solve
the
problem
of
impersonality
which
inevitably
increase
as
the
business
grow
large
while
his
own
business
have
still
be
small
he
have
work
alongside
his
employee
and
transmit
his
own
enthusiasm
to
them
but
when
it
grow
large
and
personal
contact
become
rarer
he
saw
that
most
worker
have
no
real
interest
in
their
job
it
be
then
he
write
that
the
problem
of
restore
some
sense
to
the
life
of
the
men
who
work
in

nothing

more
fatal
than
the
deflationary
spiral

it

this
problem
he
sought

he

the

the

ship
initiative
try
vainly
to
bring

i
to

he
have
an
economic
dada
in
ford

case
the
five

his
aim

when
ford
institute
the
five

in
it
seem
like
an
act

reckless
generosity
in

it
paid

itself
handsomely
as
high

lead
to
well
health

hence

it
be
not

as
straightforward
as
it
sound
you
could

ford
do
neither
and
put
some
of
your

into

in

what
work
for

not
by
all

a

the

otherwise
from
which
we
can
only
conclude
that
the
mere
fact
of
make
it
to
the
top
be
evidence
as
far
as
he
be
concerned

the

similarly
although
he
do
not
at
this
stage
think
france
should
ally
herself
with
germany
on
the
contrary
his
great
concern
be
the
unpreparedness
of
the
french
army
as
a
commit
authoritarian
he
could
not

pander
to

men
he
could
get
hold
of

put
them
to

a
formidable
military

france
schueller
felt
should
do
likewise
nevertheless
despite
his
dislike
and
distrust
of

union
a
dislike
wholeheartedly
reciprocate
he
continued
to
employ

do
not
persecute
them
as

the

so
long

would

he

minister
in
whatever
french

would
replace
the
german
when
they
left
he
therefore
set
himself
to
acquire
the
skill
without
which
success
in
politics
be
impossible
he
be
not
a
natural
orator
and
be
determine
not
to
repeat
the
experience
of
henry

he
engage
a
private
speech
tutor
to
visit
him
every
morning
and
fit
out
one
of
the
rue

a

could
try
out

before
risk
himself
in

of
a
wider
public
and
at
the

time
he
look
around
for
a
political
group
that
would
make
a
suitable
vehicle
for
his
idea
schueller
s
decision
to
throw
in
his

with
the
german
be
govern
more
by
pragmatism
than
doctrine
an
engineer
hire
by
him
during
the

and
who
make
it
clear
he
do
not
wish
to
work
even
indirectly
for
the
german
report
that
schueller
saw
my
point
of
view
but
he
say
he
thought
the
german
be
very
strong
and
well
organize
while
the
other
side
seem
completely
without
organization
it
be
just
a
social
conversation
and
i
have
to
say
i
think
m
schueller
be
too
much
of
an
opportunist
to
risk
engage
himself
absolutely
in
favor
of
anyone
in
fact
there
be
more
than
mere
opportunism
to
schueller
s
vocal
welcome
of
the
invader
the
occupation
solve
a
dilemma
that
have
long
frustrate
him
that
although
hitler
s
new
order
correspond
remarkably
closely
to
his
own
long
held
vision
hitler
himself
be
unfortunately
the
enemy
have
that
not
be
so
france
would
now
be
in
a
far
well

we
haven
t
be
as
lucky
as
the

whose

be

but
now
at
last
the
year
of
stasis
be
over
finally
the

would
realize

then
all

suffer

personally
i

that
i

actually

i
be
one
of
the
first
to
see
the
dybbuk
when
it
be
put
on
at

later
when
i
be
study
the
culture
of

i
really
love
dig
into
the
writing
of
the
great
jewish
savant
of
the
caliphate
and
cordoba
so
it
isn
t
that
i
have
anything
against
judaism
as
such
but
what
always
get
under
my
skin
be
the
notion
that
you
couldn
t
really
be
talented
intelligent
witty
or
even
courageous
unless
you
be
a
jew

could
i
bear
to

he
look

because
as
he
never
tire
of

he
be
an
authoritarian
for

convince

this

what
all
this
meant

accord
to

s
point
of

when
the
young

s
later
to

know
as
raymond
abellio
a
writer
on
the
occult
visit
msr
headquarters
for
the
first
time
he
notice
with
some
amusement
that
deloncle
so
warm
voluble
full
of
charm
and
gascon
verve
and
who
spoke
so
spontaneously
and
enthusiastically
when
he
be
discuss
his
militia
and
their
doings
only
mention
schueller
whom
he
refer
to
as
our
future
minister
of
the
national
economy
the
most
important
man
in
the
movement
at
the
end
of
their
conversation
as
an
afterthought
the
truth
of
course
be
that
what
matter
to
deloncle
be
schueller
s
money
indulgence
of
his
economic
idea
be
the
price
that
have
to
be
paid
for
it
but
if
schueller
recognize
this
later
he
say
no
doubt
deloncle
knew
how
passionate
i
felt
and
how
easy
it
would
be
to
use
me
as
a
front
man
in
certain
industrial
circle
if
he
flatter
me
it
be
of
little
importance
all
that
matter
be
that
his
idea
be
propagate
and
eventually
implement
and
why
not
through
the
charismatic
and
energetic
deloncle
other
right
wing
politician
could
see
plenty
of
reason
why
not
the
prospect
of
schueller
s
money
be
make
available
to
this
craze
fanatic
terrify
them
so
much
so
that
in
general
de
la
laurencie
p
tain
s
then
representative
in
the
occupy
zone
sent
his
nephew
to
try
to
persuade
schueller
to
moderate
his
support
for
the
msr
but
schueller
stuck
with
deloncle
part
of
the
attraction
soul
s
say
be
that
deloncle
be
an
engineer
not
a
professional
politician
like
schueller
himself
he
be
a
new
and
energetic
force
amid
the
professor
lawyer
and
old
soldier
who
generally
clutter
the
political
scene
schueller
s
defense
when
he
later
have
to
try
to
justify
his
action
be
that
he
have
be
misunderstood
and
mislead
that
in
the
word
of
his
daughter
liliane
he
be
a
pathological
optimist
who
hadn
t
the
first
idea
about
politics
and
who
always
manage
to
be
in
the
wrong
place
that
though
be
not
convincing
it
be
hard
to
believe
that
a
person
who
have
make
such
a
huge
success
in
the
cutthroat
world
of
business
could
be
quite
such
an
innocent
on
the
other
hand
his
decision
to
associate
himself
with
a
murderous
fantasist
like
deloncle
threw
serious
doubt
on
his
political
judgment
no
one
familiar
with
deloncle
s
cagoulard
past
with
its
melodramatic
plot
and
bloody
assassination
could
have
imagine
the
msr
would
ever
form
a
government
perhaps
the
explanation
be
that
the
past
even
the
recent
past
have
no
interest
for
schueller
a
true
fordist
in
this
respect
his
sole
concern
be
to
select
the
most
efficient
route
to
the
desire
future
have
picked
the
msr
as
his
route
and
with
his
blind
faith
in
the
power
of
his
economic
idea
perhaps
he
truly
thought
he
could
promote
a
coherent
political
program
within
it
that
in
soul
s
word
it
would
take
on
new
color
and
an
intelligent
game
would
become
possible
deloncle
s
personal
game
reduce
channel
make
wise
by
the
application
of
system
and
idea
if
he
do
think
this
way
however
he
have
misread
his
man
deloncle
be
happy
to
tolerate
intellectual
but
only
so
long
as
they
confine
themselves
strictly
to
cultural
activity
he
and
only
he
would

schueller
could
not
deny
that
throughout

he
have
be
one
of
the
voice
of
the

the
radio
broadcast

newspaper
article
the
public
lecture
and
the
pep
talk
to
his

spoke
for
themselves
but
politics
he
assure
the
court
have
played
no
part
in
those
talk
they
have
be
concerned
purely
with
economics
if
like
me
you
re
convince
that
you
ve
found
the
answer
to
the

s
economic

social
problem
you
obviously
can
t
stop
talk
about
them
just
because
the
wrong
people
listen
the
burden
of
his
broadcast
speech
and
article
be
indeed
economic
the

idea
about
the
proportional
salary
and
boss
responsibility
that
he
have
be

for

a

different

of

a

in
another
a

but
it
be
a

a

when

that

the

a
broken
down
old

that
it

so
that

harder
to

or

under
which
frenchman
be
compel
to
go
and
work
in
germany
be
one
example
at
first
the
german
have
try
to
raise
a
volunteer
workforce
by
promising
that
for
each
volunteer
who
go
to
germany
a
french
pow
would
be
release
this
arrangement
be
know
as
the
rel
ve
and
many
of
schueller
s
employee
attest
that
he
have
address
his
workforce
urge
those
unmarried
and
without
family
responsibility
to
volunteer
in
this
way
he
offer
substantial
sum
to
any
who
do
so
volunteer
and
explain
that
no
one
should
hesitate
to
leave
because
they
be
worried
about
the
living
condition
they
might
expect
they
would
sleep
in
good
bed
and
eat
well
this
be
very
far
from
the
general
horrific
experience
though
l
or
al
employee
return
from
germany
testify
that
they
have
receive
regular
food
parcel
schueller
admit
that
he
have
indeed
encourage
men
to
volunteer
for
the
rel
ve
but
insist
that
he
have
be
motivate
purely
by
the
desire
to
repatriate
prisoner
when
it
become
evident
that
the
german
be
not
in
fact
fulfil
this
promise
he
cease
to
support
it
in
any
case
the
program
soon
cease
to
be
voluntary
and
the
rel
ve
be
replace
by
the
compulsory
sto
but
be
schueller
s
real
motivation
as
innocent
as
he
try
to
make
it
appear
one
man
testify
that
when
he
and
his
group
left
m
schueller
give
us
lunch
and
a
little
pep
talk
say
we
didn
t
need
to
be
afraid
he
have
always
felt
more
at
home
in
germany
than
in
england
the
man
be
shock
to
hear
this
overt
enthusiasm
for
the
invader
though
perhaps
it
be
not
entirely
surprising
give
schueller
s
alsatian
parentage
alsace
border
germany
its
dialect
be
a
form
of
german
and
many
alsatian
though
not
schueller
felt
more
german
than
french
so
much
so
that
some
of
the
s
troop
who
perpetrate
the
massacre
at
oradour
sur
gl
ne
in
be
alsatian
there
be
no
doubt
that
schueller
like
all
employer
try
to
minimize
the
number
of
worker
oblige
to
undertake
this
hat
journey
as
much
for
his
own
sake
as
for
theirs
experienced
men
be
hard
to
replace
his
line
be
that
the
reason
he
have
agree
to
fulfill
some
german
business
order
be
in
order
to
keep
his
worker
in
france
which
may
have
be
true
but
of
course
be
also
a
handy
way
of
justify
collaboration
he
point
out
that
his
product
have
no
military
value
produce
figure
show
that
the
profit
derive
from

less
than
percent
of
profit
in
just
over
percent
in
and
zero
in
and
reiterate
that
he
thought
take
a
few
german
order
would
reduce
the
number
of
his
worker
force
to
go

schueller

loyal

at

george
mangeot
confirm
this
story
he
say
they
begin
to
deal
with
the
german
in
because
they
thought
that
otherwise
with
no
german
business
and
in
a
nonvital
industry
they
would
be
disadvantage
with

to
sto
the

number
do
indeed
come
down
from
to
for

from
to
for
monsavon
but
mangeot
also
described
how
after
discuss
the
matter
with
schueller
he
get
the
number
reduce
in
quite
another
way
by
bribing
a
german
member

at
the

allemand
who
be
later
shot
have

at

the

this
and

him

the

however
b
nouville
save

twice
at
the

and
again
after
the

verdict
he

a

of
his

on

which
have

him
into

imprudent
action
but
he
have
be
of
inestimable
help
to
b
nouville
b
nouville
get
his
way
and
schueller
be
let
off
such
solidarity
between
resister
and
collaborator
be
not
unusual
during
the
puration
as
schueller
s
own
activity
demonstrate
channel
of
communication
between
the
two
side
have
always
remain
open
during
the
occupation
collaborator
often
put
in
a
word
for
a
resistance
figure
in
trouble
now
those
who
have
be
help
help
in
their
turn
b
nouville
testify
in
this
way
on
behalf
of
many
old
friend
what
be
interest
about
his
effort
for
schueller
however
be
that
the
two
have
met
only
once
and
then
briefly
when
schueller
anxious
to
buy
himself
onto
the
win
side
have
promise
financial
aid
when
b
nouville
need
it
indeed
b
nouville
insist
that
schueller
have
never
approach
him
personally
for
help
what
he
have
do
he
have
do
for
max
brusset
even
so
it
seem
surprising
that
he
should
have
put
quite
so
much
effort
into
get
schueller
clear
why
have
he
do
so
the
answer
like
everything
else
about
schueller
could
be
trace
back
to
the
life
rule
he
have
evolve
the
way
both
schueller
and
rubinstein
conduct
their
family
affair
would
be
decisive
in
the
intermingle
of
their
story
and
b
nouville
for
schueller
be
family
albeit
that
family
be
a
surrogate
one
and
b
nouville

such
a
thought

anathema
to

thought

very
particular
skill
and
that
be
a
general

word
in

that

devise
an
innovative
continuous
soap

process
that
would
prove
valuable
in
the
immediate
postwar
year
however
they
couldn

try
it
out
on
monsavon

which
consist
almost
wholly
of
bentonite

and
there

in
those
desperate
day
when

short
good

almost
unobtainable
and
nobody
trust

the

but
it
then
face
the
problem
of
survive
the
peace
which

its

difficulty
in
wartime
the
buying

grabbed
anything

now
the

lose
the

of

and
soon

that
the

interested
him
so
he
return
joyfully
to

during
these

let
dalle
get
on
with
the

without
interference
one
summer
sunday
in
however
an
indication
come
that
schueller
have
plan
for
him
summon
to
the
franconville
house
dalle
be
inform
that

as
well
as
monsavon
he
have
do
well
with
monsavon
and
hopefully
would
continue
to
do
so
but
now
it
be
time
to
find
his
place
within
the
company
as
a
whole
i
be
flatter
but
terribly
embarrass
dalle
remember
it
hadn
t
ever
cross
my
mind
that
woman
s
hair
grow
white
as
they
get
old
let
alone
that
they
might
dye
it
the
notion
that
one
might
want
to
change
the
natural
order
of
thing
would
have
seem
odd
to
me
actually
almost
shock
where
i
come
from
woman
didn
t
use
cosmetic
this
uncertainty
be
soon
bury
however
beneath
the
whirlwind
of
his
new
life
he
be
give
an
office
at
rue

and
begin
the
long
task
of
get
to
know
a
new
business
and
gain
the
trust
of
longstanding
lieutenant
over
whose
head
he
be
all
too
evidently
be
promote
he
soon
become
schueller
s
chief
confidant
which
meant
adopt
his
chief
s
frenetic
pace
from
six
till
eight
a
m
he
read
note
dictate
by

the
previous
even
then
walk
for
an
hour
around
the
park
at
bagatelle
near
where
he
live
before

his

he
spent
the
morning
at

and
the

at

al
stay
there
until
nine
the
hour
when
schueller
left
the

after
a
few
month
of
this
pace
he
become
tire
and
schueller
offer
him
and
his
family
the
l
arcouest

for
a
couple
of
week
of

work
await
his
return
he
call
for
his
secretary
and
resume
his
parisian
work
schedule
wonder
later
if
this
have
not
be
a
deliberate
ploy
on
the
part
of
schueller
who
do
the

thing
during
his
vacation
it
be

clear
to
them
both
that
dalle
would
be

but
it
be
not
until
when

begin
to
fail

that

but
dalle
would
be
its
future
the
speech
left
both
of
them
in
tear
not
long
after

in

they
make
it
clear
that
the
two
have
become
close
enough
for

to
trust
the
young

both
money

personal
confidence

the
course
of

in

those
who
have
position
themselves
three
year
earlier

of

awkwardly

for

there
it
be
clear
from
his

to

that
both
of

anticipate

seem
increasingly

be
very
careful
you

so
terribly

about

i

you
should

cautious
about
reveal
too
much
regard
the
way
you
ve
help
some

quiet
if

agree
that
the
essential

to

agree
to

if
not

not
in
any
way
put
out
by
schueller
s
link
with
the

and
msr
rather
the
opposite
he
have
himself
be
an
enthusiastic
cagoulard
his
name
appear
in
the
corre
list
of

and
although
when
question
in
old
age
he
refuse
to
admit
directly
that
he
have
belong
to

on
the

that
he
quite
understood
why

he
have
be

something
b
nouville
seem
to
have
felt
merit
a
death
sentence
his
nationalism
be
so
extreme
that
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
countenance
any
form
of
collaboration
with
the
german
occupation
but
his
gut
loathe
of

he

to
the

something
about

that
i
didn

like
at

prefer
to

who

who
in
switch
over
to

who
be
close
enough
to
b
nouville
to
have
a
special
postbox
arrangement
to
communicate
with
him
indeed
b
nouville
be
if
anything
to
the
right
of

politically
certainly
in
his
anti

in
he
have
be
a
regular
contributor
to

a

anti

it
be
the

too
that
steer
bettencourt
clear
of
the
anticipate
post
liberation
hazard
by
the
summer
of
it
be
obvious
that
anyone
who
want
to
enter
public

after
the

would
need
to
show
they
have

a
r
sistant
and
mitterrand
and
b
nouville
who
both
have
starry
resistance
credential
have
work
together
to
ensure
while
there
be
still
time
that
their
old

would
come
out
of

they
do
so
by
arrange
to
send

i
m
just
back
from

write

that

she

he

dalle
suggest
to

be
a
good
thing
if
he
temporarily
step
down
from

thus
far
both

that
this
be
the
way

as
to
what
happen
next
however
they
disagreed
bitterly
dalle
say
frydman
have
not
object
to
resign
temporarily

have
even
have
a

of
resignation
prepared
by
one
of
his
aide
frydman
on
the
contrary
insist
that
he
have
object
and
strongly
he
have
no
wish
whatever
to
accommodate
the
arab
boycott
committee
despite
this
however
his
resignation
be
offer
and
accepted
without
his
knowledge
at
a
board
meeting
held
also
without
his
knowledge
in
april
of
that
he
have
know
nothing
about
the

be
not
surprising
since

that
frydman
have
disinter
his
article
and
be
prepare
to
publish
them
be
at
a
symposium
on
museum
management
he
be
moderate
when
question
be
invite
david
frydman
stood
up
and
say
he
be
propose
to
fund
a
museum
of
the
collaboration
he
have
a
set
of
bettencourt
s
article
for
la
terre
fran
aise
would
bettencourt
agree
to
donate
the
manuscript
to
frydman
s
museum
later
bettencourt
would
try
to
pretend
that
he
could
not
remember
what
he
have
write
all
those
year
ago
and
that
in
any
case
his
article
have
be
anodyne
and
unimportant
but
his
reaction
to
frydman
s
intervention
indicate
that
on
the
contrary
he
remember
only
too
well
and
knew
the
effect
disclosure
might
have
on
his
current
image
the
shock
be
palpable
he
turn
pale
and
left
the
room
when
he
return
he
be
urge
by
a
member
of
the
panel
not
to
answer
but
reject
this
suggestion
with
the
word
i
be
a
public
figure
i
must
answer
he
go
on
it
be
true
that
i
have
the
misfortune
to
write
for
la
terre
fran
aise
but
i
redeem
myself
i
be
in
the
resistance
i
even
represent
the
national
council
of
liberation
at
geneva
bettencourt
at
once
use
his
powerful
position
as
a
senator
to
try
to
prevent
the
matter
go
any
far
when
frydman
return
to
the
library
to
make
sure
he
have
photograph
everything
he
found
that
all
copy
of
la
terre
fran
aise
have
vanished
he
look
elsewhere
in
vain
the

have
be
remove
from
every
library
in
france
except
the
biblioth
que

where
he
finally
tracked
it
down
it
have
recently
be
move
there
from
the
library
s
then
main
building
in
rue
richelieu
probably
escape
bettencourt
s
sweep
because
at
the
crucial
moment
it
be
in
transit
between

the

his

he
have
undeniably
be
award
the

for
what
exactly
in

write
that

but
these
claim
do
not
stand
up
to
examination
it
be
true
that
bettencourt
do
go

in
the
summer
of
that
year
mitterrand

forward
the

and
forbade
all

particularly
in

when

with

policy

bettencourt
s
first
line
of
defense
be
to
insist
that
everything
about
his
past
be
know
and
have
long
be
dealt
with
and
dismiss
i
answer
the
question
about
la

in
my
very
first
electoral
campaign
he
told
new

and
some
year
later
interviewed
for
a
book
he
say
everyone
knew
perfectly
well
what
my
position
be
during

this
tack
fail

he
have
any
idea
who
the
real
owner
of
la

be
i
knew
absolutely
nothing
about
that
for
me
it
be
just
a
magazine
with
a
large
circulation
among
agriculturalist
and
when
all
these
excuse
fail
he
simply
go
into

confront
with

another
outrageously
anti

where
he
be
replace
as
vice
president
by
his
son
in

jean

by
a
supreme
irony
a
jew
whose
grandfather
have
die
in

and
declare
he
would
not
be
stand
in

have
nothing
to

with

he
make
a
point
of
not
have
receive
until

three
day
after
his

on

he
say
l

ceo
lindsay
owen

have
be
aware
for
some
time
of
his
impend
departure
at
the
age
of
seventy
six
he
could
no
longer
fulfil
his
duty
as
actively
as
he
should
and
from
now
on
he
would
have
to
curtail
his
activity
but
source
close
to
l
or
al
s
management
told
le
monde
that
on
the
contrary
the
letter
and
the
resignation
be
by
no
mean
unconnected
the
trouble
stem
from
the
corr
ze
affair
be
only
just
behind
them
and
they
be
anxious
that
this
new
embarrassment
should
remain
confine
to
bettencourt
himself
and
not
taint
the
company
or
its
principal
shareholder
who
be
of
course
his
wife
the
tone
bettencourt
take
thereafter
on
the
rare
occasion
when
he
consent
to
speak
about
the
affair
be
one
of
sadness
and
indignation
he
be
he
assert
the
victim
of
a
malicious
conspiracy
but
the
more
i
say
the
more
i
stoke
the
polemic
it
s
all
a
terrible
trap
he
complain
to
le
monde
have
some
consideration
for
my
dignity
it
s
appal
to
imply
that
i
could
possibly
have
participate
in
genocide
and
write
to
congressman
engel
he
reiterate
the
accusation
that
have
so
enrage
jean
frydman
when
he
have
first
make
it
say
that
in
his
view
this
sudden
revival
of
interest
in
article
write
half
a
century
ago
be
at
least
partly
due
to
the
misrepresentation
of
event
by
people
who
want
to
make
sure
their
financial
interest
prevail
v
it
seem
clear
that
neither
andr
bettencourt
nor
jacques
corr
ze
felt
guilty
about
what
they
have
do
during
the
war
their
regret
be
rather
for
the
embarrassment
their
youthful
act
cause
them
later
but
that
regret
manifest
itself
quite
differently
in
the
two
men
and
have
different
root
bettencourt
s
chagrin
clearly
stem
from
the
sense
that
he
have
be
unfairly
picked
out
countless
others
include
doubtless
many
of
his
own
acquaintance
have
act
as
discreditably
as
he
even
if
they
have
not
as
he
have
actively
promote
fascism
they
have
adjust
their
life
to
it
without
too
much
trouble
but
the
puration
be
suppose
to
have
dealt
with
all
that
one
of
its
important
function
have
be
to
act
as
an
exercise
in
the
suppression
of
memory
so
that
france
could
step
forward
into
the
future
confident
that
the
bad
offender
have
be
punish
for
private
individual
this
amnesia
take
effect
almost
instantly
thus
the
journalist
merry
bromberger
profile
schueller
in
only
six
year
after
his
second
trial
gloss
over
his
wartime
career
with
the
comment
from
time
to
time
his
enthusiasm
have
lead
him
where
he
shouldn

have
go
all
this
meant
that
when
bettencourt
say
everyone
knew
perfectly
well
what
my
position
be
during
the
war
the
truth
be
in

just
the
opposite
people
thought
they
knew
and
want
nothing
more
than
to
go
on

so
no
one
in
the
french
establishment
welcome
his
exposure
it
undermined
the
whole
edifice
if
bettencourt

show
to

believe
for
what
make
the
bettencourt
case
so
disturb
and
what
so
infuriate
him
be
the
certainty
that
it
be
not
unique
his
shameful
trajectory
have
after
all
only
be
reveal
by
the
sheerest
chance
if
corr
ze
have
not
become
obsess
with
take
over

if
the

not

if

not
picked
jean
frydman
as
a
partner
for
l
or
al
none
of
his
wartime
activity
would
have
come
out
it
be
possible
that
the
fate
have
picked
the
one
rotten
apple
out
of
the
barrel
possible
but
not
probable
what
of
the
industrialist
who
have
so
enthusiastically
fund
la
cagoule
and
whose

very
different
and
how
many

like

himself
transform
themselves
into
r

at
the

the
people
most
anxious
that

not
pursue
his
vendetta
to
the
bitter
end
be
mitterrand
himself
this
story
have
go
too
far
his
aide
charles
salzmann
told
david
frydman
the
president
didn
t
want
the

discuss
in

because
they

it

many
detractor
seize
upon
the

point
up
his

relation
and
question
whether
he
have
played
the
important
part
in
the
resistance
that
he
have
always
claimed
in
particular
they
pounce
upon
a
decoration
he
have
played
down
the
francisque
the
medal
award
for
outstanding
service
to
vichy
and
p
tain
mitterrand
could
hardly
deny
receive
it

themselves
by

the
best
possible
alibi
now
however
when
people
look
into
the

more
closely
they
found
that

part
of

be
no
surprise
of
all
the
gang
from
his
background
be
probably
the
furthest
right
and
his
family
be
intertwine
in
many
way
and
on
many
level
with
la
cagoule
not
only
be
his
sister
marie
jos

for
many
year
the
lover
of
jean
bouvyer
who
be
involve
in
the
rosselli
assassination
but
the
mitterrand
be
actually
related
to
the
deloncles
via
mitterrand
s
brother
robert
whose
wife
be
merc
d
s
deloncle

of

off

with

deloncles

after

they
look
after
his

present
in

at
their
wedding
in
when

new

a
party
at
the
hotel

in
new
york
give
by
the
local
french
community
corr

friend
and
colleague
be
astonish
to
see
the
president
greet
him
with
a
warm
hug
but
the
point
about
mitterrand
s
far
right
connection
which
he
so
fervently
do
not
wish
exhume
be
that
they
have
never
be
secret
when
he
first
emerge
as
a
leader
of
the
left
during
the
s
the
political
scandal
sheet
make
much
of
this
sudden
volta
face
our
aim
here
isn
t
to
determine
the
exact
relation
between
m
mitterrand
and
la
cagoule
everyone
know
that
that
monster
by
which
of
course
we
mean
la
cagoule
have
many
head
and
thousand
of
foot
we
merely
note
that
it
s
odd
that
an
eminent
member
of
the
udsr
mitterrand
s
party
should
be
mixed
up
in
the
intrigue
of
cagoulards
who
manage
during
the
occupation
to
construct
a
vichyist
gaullist
collabo
r
sistant
synthesis
before
which
the
most
persistent
bloodhound
would
lose
heart
comment
one
in
in
another
invoked
the
political
water
in
which
mitterrand
first
met
his
friend
schueller
the
father
in
law
of
bettencourt
who
s
now
a
minister
and
the
same
be
true
of
jacques
corr
ze
if
anyone
want
to
look
his
beginning
with
l
or
al
be
an
open
secret
the
latter
article
go
on
to
mention
the
cagoulard
jacques
corr
ze
who
owes
his
job
in
madrid
to
schueller
and
later
as
lindsay
owen
jones
dalle
s
successor
say
quite
plainly
this
be
not
a
guy
who
try
to
hide
in
argentina
or
brazil
he
never
change
his
name
it
be
all
out
there
if
you
want
to
know
it
the
truth
be
that
most
people
do
not
want
to
know
they
want
to
look
forward
not
backward
in
the
word
of
mitterrand
s
socialist
party
colleague
laurent
fabius
whom
he
have
make
france
s
young
ever
prime
minister
what
do
i
care
what
he
d
do
thirty
year
ago
fran
ois
dalle
for
instance
knew
all
about
corr
ze
but
decide
to
employ
him
nonetheless
in
dalle
s
eye
he
have
paid
his
debt
to
society
as
a
participant
in
the
resistance
i
thought
it
be
important
to
demonstrate
tolerance
at
a
time
of
reconciliation
in
france
but
then
neither
dalle
nor
owen
jones
have
ever
suffer
at
the
hand
of
corr
ze
and
his
like
those
who
have
be
not
so
blithe
about
let
bygone
be
bygone
and
france
s
problem
in
the
postwar
year
be
that
the
two
side
the
victim
and
the
rest
could
never
agree
as
to
the
best
way
forward
one
side
wish
to
move
on
the
other
for
whom
closure
be
impossible
unless
the
past
be
recognize
could
not
move
on
until
it
have
see
justice
do
the
l
or
al
affair
exhume
this
split
which
be
why
so
many
people
found
it
so
painful
this
problem
be
not
unique
to
france
in
one
form
or
another
it
affected
many
country
after
the
war
but
what
make
the
french
situation
particularly
edgy
be
that
anti
semitism
have
for
so
many
year
be
one
of
the
mantra
of
the
anti
republican
right
and
that
for
many
the
differentiation
this
imply
between
french
jew
and
the
real
french
have
never
really
be
efface
thus
in
when
a
bomb
explode
at
a
synagogue
in
paris
s
rue
copernic
the
then
prime
minister
raymond
barre
comment
this
disgust
attack
be
aim
at
the
jew
who
be
go
to
the
synagogue
but
it
actually
injured
innocent
frenchman
who
be
cross
the
street
if
as
late
as
in
the
mind
of
a
moderate
politician
jew
and
innocent
frenchman
be
still
instinctively
differentiate
then
it
be
clear
just
how
embed
in
the
national
psyche
action
fran
aise
s
demonization
still
remain
obviously
there
be
real
difference
between
a
bettencourt
who
simply
blew
with
whatever
wind
prevail
and
a
corr
ze
who
have
be
a
commit
nazi
and
who
make
a
point
of
insist
that
he
have
always
act
on
principle
the
senator
bettencourt
of
probably
be
genuinely
different
from
the
young
man
he
have
once
be
just
as
the
climate
of
postwar
opinion
be
genuinely
different
from
that
in
which
he
have
be
brought
up
admittedly
his
career
be
base
on
lie
but
by
the
time
frydman
resuscitate
them
he
have
told
the
official
story
so
often
that
he
have
probably
come
to
believe
it
have
he
truly
be
that
young
fascist
cheerleader
his
reaction
to
david
frydman
s
revelation
show
that
he
knew
he
have
but
how
could
that
young
man
have
turn
into
the
person
he
be
now
be
it
really
he
who
have
inveigh
against
the
republic
and
her
mask
of
parliamentarianism
and
liberalism
he
who
have
call
for
a
leader
who
command
not
a
crowd
of
clerk
eternally
discuss
it
be
impossible
yet
it
be
true
a
journalist
who
spoke
to
him
on
the
phone
after
his
resignation
say
he
sound
wound
and
torment
there
s
this
incredible
atmosphere
of
hate
bettencourt
say
i
have
to
withdraw
from
the
only
occasion
i
ve
be
offer
to
put
my
side
of
thing
on
television
because
i
found
out
they
be
go
to
accompany
it
with
image
of
the
german
march
up
the
champ
lys
e
you
just
have
to
put
up
with
it
every
time
you
talk
about
it
you
just
fall
into
another
trap
to
say
i
m
an
anti
semite
be
shameful
when
my
only
daughter
be
married
to
a
jew
who
s
like
a
son
to
me
after
fifty
year
of
an
existence
devote
to
my
country
be
i
only
to
be
see
as
an
anti
semite
and
anti
freemason
it
s
horrible
no
such
bitter
regret
be
ever
felt
by
corr
ze
he
have
never
as
bettencourt
have
suppress
the
person
he
have
once
be
on
the
contrary
he
insist
that
he
do
what
he
do
when
the
msr
be
in
its
prime
for
a
noble
cause
haughtily
declare
that
although
he
have
lose
faith
in
the
msr
some
time
before
deloncle
die
he
have
not
abandon
his
old
mentor
while
he
live
because
i
do
not
desert
my
friend
have
his
view
change
simply
because
they
be
no
longer
admissible
it
seem
unlikely
rather
his
whole
life
have
be
a
continuation
of
the
same
game
and
when
that
game
be
expose
he
be
not
so
much
embarrass
as
furious
naturally
he
never
go
so
far
as
to
publicly
glory
in
his
past
when
first
question
about
his
role
in
expel
jew
include
george
mandel
who
until
june
have
be

of
the
interior
and
bernheim
the
well
know
art
dealer
from
their
home
and
business
he
too
resort
to
evasion
first
deny
everything
i
can
t
recall
it
i
don
t
think
that
can
be
true
he
say
first
then
insist
that
there
be
a
difference
between
what
he
have
do
and
actually
maltreat
jew
faire
de
saloperies
contre
le
juifs
which
be
true
enough
he
have
wait
for
others
to
do
the
dirty
work
and
then
take
the
profit
a
few
day
later
he
issue
a
write
statement
assert
that
there
s
no
one
among
those

during
the
occupation

who
can
complain
of
have
suffer
in
his
person
or
his
good
from
my
activity
but
in
the
end
his
action
be
what
they
be
and
he
do
not
apologize
for
them
the
characteristic
that
struck
reporter
during
the
cagoule
trial
in
be
his
arrogance
he
sat
aloofly
at
the
end
of
the
row
lean
away
from
his
fellow
accuse
his
handsome
head
thrown

from
a
distance
down

a
weary
politeness
he

remark
a
romantic
figure
he

utterly
unrepentant
and

do
you

savagely
back
i
don

know
if
i

i
m
about
to
become

he
do
not
like
bettencourt
try
to
cheat
the
god
rather
in
a
classic
tale
of
hubris
he
simply
give
them
the
finger
push
his
luck
because
he
felt
himself
invincible

his
stand

gentleman

on
the

saint
paul
recommend
that

should
cover

their
crown

a

assume
that
the
only
reason
a
woman
might
want
to
look
good
in
public
and
thus
the
only
point
of
cosmetic
be
to
seem
more
attractive
to
the
opposite
sex
if

the

thing
about

be
the
inescapable
sense
that

do
not

on
the

still
remains
the
primary
function
of
cosmetic
and
more
recently
cosmetic
surgery
in
a
survey
of
british

conduct
in

only
percent
of

say
they
be
do
so
because
they
want
to
look
more
attractive
to
men
while
percent
thought
it
would
give
them
more
confidence
that
confidence
would
of
course
help
should
they
wish
to
attract
a
man
but
it
would
also
help
them
function
without
one
powder
and
paint
when
worn
by
respectable
woman
be
thus
intolerable
to
the
victorian
on
two
front
first
they
bolster
the
self
esteem
of
a
class
of
person
suppose
to
be
meek
and
subordinate
second
they
represent
a
highly
visible
form
of
rebellion
an
incontrovertible
and
unmissable
statement
that
the
wearer
value
her
personal
satisfaction
above
the
wish
of
her
husband
one
might
turn
a
blind
eye
to
the
receipt
of

her
there
be
little

i
would
actually
have
the

we
agree
that
she

take

don
t
we
begin
with

and

and
then
the

explain
what
the
procedure
would
be
and
the
cost
with
one
night
in
hospital
a
breast

would
cost
me
with

night
plus
another
for
a
subsequent
necessary
injection
that
be
serious
money
for
which
i
have
other
us
but
as
we
go
on
and
against
all
expectation
i
found
myself
wonder
whether
perhaps
i
mightn
t
have
the

be
it

late

still

i
d
almost
certainly
have
do
it
vanity
vanity
but
research
show
that
this
desire
to
attain
something
nearer
one
s
ideal
physical
self
be
more
than
that
our
preference
for

people
over

hardwired

such

must
affect
how
others

us

until
now
we
have
never
be
able
permanently
to
alter
our
less
attractive

characteristic
which
would
seem
to
imply
that
the
real
gift
be
agency
the
fact
that
we
be
now
able
to
take
the
necessary
action

study
of

include
one
woman
whose
breast
augmentation
go
disastrously
wrong
lead
to
multiple
correctional
operation
and

but
she
be
still
pleased
she
have
have
the

do
before
it
she
have
see
life
as
a

spiral
over
which
she

no
control

she
felt

it
would
turn
out

in

age

a

in
everything
else
and
there
can
always
be
a

another
iii
but
if
new
body
and
new

be
available
off
the
rack
how
will
we
choose
which
to
select
who
set
the
fashionable
ideal
the
answer
be
some
enviable
powerful
other
the
look
of
the
eighteenth
century
french
court
for
example
be
not

clownish
but
dangerous
everyone
knew
that

be
a
deadly
poison
that
ruin
the

it
cover

could
cause

but
the

paint
his

in

rather
than

the

be
a
matter
of

it

ape
the
look
of

it

we

we
could

at

photography
have
always
be
an
art
as
much
as

because
the
early

super
sharp

thus

she
paid
him
never
in
any
case
more
than
a
very
moderate
salary
banier
s
relationship
with
madame
bettencourt
appear
to
be
rather
different
the
two
first
met
in
at
the
home
of
the
journalist
pierre
and
h
l
ne
lazareff
neuilly
neighbor
of
the
bettencourts
madame
bettencourt
be
then
in
her
forty
as
banier
remember
the
most
sought
after
woman
in
society
very
impressive
and
extraordinarily
beautiful
but
they
do
not
become
close
at
that
time
that
happen
eighteen
year
later
in
when
bettencourt
be
sixty
five
and

thirty
nine
he
be
assign
to
photograph
her
for
the
ego
ste

they
become
friend
and
the
friendship
flourish
banier
quickly
become
a
habitu
of
the
bettencourt
mansion
inevitably
madame
bettencourt
be
at
home
much
more
than
her
busy
husband
soon
he
be
not
just
her
friend
but
her
principal
friend
ironically
during
that
interview
one
of
the
question
be
about
whether
she
wasn
t
afraid
of
be
love
just
for
her
money
how
would
one
like
to
be
love
then
she
say
do
one
have
to
be
ugly
and
undersized
and
fat
before
one
can
know
that
one
s
love
for
oneself
that
she
love
banier
for
himself
be
beyond

and

she
who
initiate
this

you

get
a
nerve
he
say
castaing
say
when
she
saw
the

but
that
s
fine
it
s
me
they
be
exhibit
everywhere
and
launch
banier

career
ask
whether

try
to

that

with
a

banier
met
liliane

for
the
second
time
madeleine
castaing
be
already
ninety
three
clearly
this
source
of
support
could
not
last
much
longer
so
it
be
a
happy
chance
that
at
the
crucial
moment
another
generous
friend
should
present
herself
press
as
to
whether
he
didn

sometimes
think
his

also

immaterial
as
this
may

this

what

in
the

there
she

the
untold

there

it

that

to

really
figure
in

be
liliane
herself
she
be
simply

the

no

accrues
to

anyone
who
know
about

his
idea
will
recognize
that
this
fate
to
have
all
the

and
none
of
the

might
have
be
precisely
albeit
unintentionally
design
by
the

idolize
just
as
the
nazi
scandal
be
a
consequence
of
his

so
the
affaire
bettencourt
be
a
consequence
of
his
social
theory
schueller
as
we
have
see
have
decide
opinion
on
many
subject
among
them
the
place
of

in

woman
in
his
view
be
there
to
support
men
they
be
for

and
breeding
child
they
should
never
compete
in
the
man
s

of

this
be
the
mold
in
which
liliane
be
cast
and
she
do
not
question
it
first
her
widowed
father
s
dutiful
daughter
then
her
husband
s
supportive
wife
she
now
it
seem
exists
for
the
benefit
of
banier
de

and
their
friend
it
be
for
men
to
dictate
the
program
liliane
true
daughter
of
her
father
merely
facilitates
it
it
be
deeply
ironic
that
the
source
of
all
this
money
should
be
cosmetic
the
same
commodity
that
constitute
