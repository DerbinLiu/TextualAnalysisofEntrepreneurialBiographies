no

about

ten

by
the
mid

we
be
already
trading
one
million
barrel
of

per

marc

soon
become
the

in

also
all
type
of

zinc
in

it
s
now
marc
rich
and
the
forty
dwarf
a
competitor
say
reflect
a
sentiment
somewhere
between
respect
and
resignation
an
oil
trader
in
england
who
have
work
for
rich
for
many
year
before
successfully
go
into
business
for
himself
once
told
me
without
any
hint
of
irony
marc
be
a
titan
no
more
than
that
he
be
our
god
when
he
call
to
congratulate
you
on
a
profitable
trade
it
be
like
god
call
you
from
the
big
devil
to
god
there
can
be
no
great
span
when
it
come
to
evaluate
a
person
pitch
black
or
snow
white
why
be
rich
so
polarize
how
do
he
manage
to
stir
such
emotion
there
be
a
psychological
explanation
for
this
phenomenon
it
be
easy
to
pigeonhole
rich
we
can
ignore
the
ambiguity
and
complexity
of
rich
s
person
as
well
as
the
ambiguity
and
complexity
of
the
oil
trade
in
general
if
we
demonize
rich
or
if
we
make
him
appear
large
than
life
we
make
it
easy
for
ourselves
to
forget
the
moral
and
political
contradiction
of
our
own
action
most

from
country
that
be
not
beacon
of
democracy
and
human
right
the
resource
curse

the
paradox

be
the
term
economist

political
scientist
use
to
describe
the
fact
that
country
that
be
rich
in

be
usually
plague
by
poverty
corruption
and
misgovernment
if
commodity
trader
want
to
be
successful
they
be

agent

will
take
their
information
from
any
source
to
sit
down
with
people
that
they
would
rather
not
have
as
friend
and
they
apparently
have
to
resort
to
practice
that
be
either
frown
upon
or
downright
illegal
in
other
part

when
in

do
as
the

do
an

once
say
in

to
one
of
my
question
he
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
in

admit
he
have
paid

the

do
not

this

this
all
make
him
one
of
the
richest
men
in

and
a
bogeyman
to
all
political
camp
the

see
him
not
as

as
an
exploiter
of
the

the

considers
him
a

for
do

see
him
as
the

fraudster
of

his

provide
long
explanation
detail
how
all
of
his
business
dealing
be
perfectly
legal
under

public
opinion
remains
unmoved
by
this
argument
not
to
mention
the
american
politician
who
be
convince
that
the
opposite
be
the
case
it
be
clear
that
rich
built
his
fortune
do
business
without
legal
ethical
or
even
moral
restraint
the
house
committee
on

conclude
rich
who
of
all
people
always
maintain
that
his
company
act
apolitically
sank
ever
deeper
in
the
political
meat
grinder
his
trading
with
iran
after
khomeini
s
seizure
of
power
remains
his
mortal
sin
but
american
politician
also
get
angry
about
his
allege
dealing
with
muammar
el
qaddafi
s
libya
even
after
u
s
oil
company
completely
withdrew
from

they
denounce
him
for
sell
grain
to
the

after
the

have
enact
an
embargo
against
the

follow
its
invasion
of

rage
over
the

with

despite
the

embargo
mr

publicly
report
to

trade
with
just
about
every
enemy
of
the

they
have
have
over
the
last
twenty
year
and
many
of
those
country
be
embargoed
say
dan
burton
the
influential
chairman
of
the
house
committee
on
government
reform
when
its
report
on
rich
be
write
anti
semitic
stereotype
the
capitalist
without
a
country
who
make
deal
with
the
enemy
the
speculator
who
creates
nothing
of
his
own
but
only
act
as
an
intermediary
while
profit
from
others
the
bloodsucker
of
the
third
world
as
rich
be
once
refer
to
in
the
swiss
parliament
the
perfidious
profiteer
who
would
rather
leave
his
own
country
and
give
up
his
citizenship
than
pay
tax
many
critic
may
not
be
aware
of
the
anti
semitic
stereotype
that
resonate
throughout
these
accusation
more
than
a
few
of
my
interviewee
see
this
as
at
least
one
of
the
reason
why
rich
be
so
persecute
while
other
oil
company
that
act
in
a
similar
fashion
be
treat
much
more
leniently
i
don
t
really
like
to
use
the
word
anti
semitic
because
you
can
say
for
any
type
of
criticism
that
this
or
that
be
anti
semitic
usually
it
be
just
not
true
but
in
marc
s
case
this
be
a
really
big
problem
avner
azulay

to

a
very
fine
line
between

ruin
between
right

wrong
between
success
and
loneliness
a
south

told
me
of

by

in

index
finger
over
the

he
say
as
a
trader
you
often
walk
on
the
blade
be
careful
and
don
t
step
off
if
one
believe
rudy
giuliani
and
his
assistant
sandy
weinberg
then
rich
really
do
step
off
in
the
early
s
we
didn
t
have
a
good
case
we
have
an
overwhelm
case
weinberg
told
me
however
giuliani
and
weinberg
never
have
to
prove
in
court
how
good
their
case
actually
be
as
rich
elect
not
to
return
to
the
united

the

never
take
place
and
he
be
never
convict
or
acquit
one
aspect
of
marc
rich
s
career
that
be
virtually
forgotten
during
the
entire
affair
be
his
unique
entrepreneurial
success
for
starter
he
be
more
than
just
a
profiteer
and
boycott
breaker
it
be
not
rich
s
allege
tax
evasion
that
make
him
the
twentieth
century
s
most
dominant
trader
when
i
ask
how
he
have
manage
to
achieve
so
much
he
answer
with
the
standard
trader
s
joke
buy
low
sell
high
then
he
add
in
a
more
serious
tone
the
ingredient
be
hard
work
hard
work
and
hard
work
and
good
collaborator
obviously
a
little
bit
of
luck
help
also
these
be
surely
important
element
of

they
cannot
provide
a
good
explanation
for
the
sheer
scale
of
his
remarkable
achievement
it

his

in
this

as
well
as
his
feeling
of

this

be
far
strengthen
by
his
experience
as
a

a

a
strange
piece
of
information
state
that
the

apparently
move
directly
from
the

twelve
different

fact
make
it
even
more
difficult
for
him
as
a
refugee
and
an
only
child
to
find
friend
he
remain
a
loner
who
be
left
to
his
own
device
a
force
of
habit
that
developed
with
time
into
a
characteristic
rich
would
always
be
an
outsider
someone
who
neither
belong
to
the
establishment
nor
want
to
he
be
someone
with
a
nothing

attitude
who
have
something
to
prove
you
cry
a
little
and
then

still
european
at

where
they

spoke
french

with
each
other
a
year
later
they
move
to
holly
street
in
kansa
city
missouri
they
live
in
a
cramped
apartment
on
the

situate
in
a
fairly
unglamorous
neighborhood

become
american
citizen
on
february
for
the
first
time
since
flee
from

the
few
classmate
who

that

of
black
wavy
hair
i
think
one
of
the
reason
he

be
because
he
be

the
two

whether

corner
the

in
any
commodity
at

over
everything
with

santos
blanco
be
of
enormous
importance
for

career
as
the
next
chapter
will
show
without
him
rich
would
not
have
be
so
successful
at
such
an
early
stage
the
fact
that
the
jewish
businessman
and
the
ultra
catholic
professor
should
become
friend
remains
one
of
the
paradox
in
marc
rich
s
life
it
be
certainly
surprising
that
rich
have
such
a
great
love
for
fascist
spain
francisco
franco
owe
his
victory
in
the
spanish
civil

mainly
to
support
from
nazi
germany
although
spain
remain
officially
neutral
during

war
ii
it
openly
sympathize
with

franco
claimed
to
be
a
friend
of
the
arab
nation
and
he
neither
recognize
israel
nor
strive
for
diplomatic
relation
he
permit
the
palestine
liberation
organization
plo
to
open
an
office
in
madrid
in
israel
be
not
recognize
by
spain
until
even
though
he
enjoy
very
close
connection
to
israel
rich
be
apparently
not
concerned
about
franco
s
policy
marc
didn
t
care
about
it
one
old
friend
in

work
with

the
time
told
me
he
didn

about

make
money
this
be
one
of
marc
s
strength
this
type
of
neutrality
have
prove
to
be
an
advantage
to
rich

success
in

might

his

amoral

the

venezuela
increase

as
do
iran

the

that
the

actually
the

within

after
the

they
resume

however
the

through
which
the

of
the

destine
for

pass
until
the
paradoxical
effect
of
the

be
that
due
to
increase

there
be
now
a
great

than
there
be
demand
for
it
this
state
of
affair
sound
like
a
wonderful
opportunity
to
a
resourceful
trader
like
marc

and
while
he
be
in
spain
he
realize
that
there
be
money
to
be
make
in
trading

he
have
already
discuss
the
idea
with
alfredo
santos
blanco
his
economist
friend
who
work
in
the
spanish
ministry
of

fascist

which
do
not
recognize

maintain
excellent

with
the

arab
world
rich
be
determine
to
take
advantage
of
this
special
situation
but
then
along
come
alan
flack
in
and
threaten
to
steal
this
new
market
from
under
his
nose
rich
be
lucky
in
that
philipp
brother
be
not
organize
along
a
strict
set
of
rule
there
be
no
first
come
first
serve
rule
for
example
whoever
have
well
idea
well
contact
or
just
well
luck
be
the
one
who
could
make
the
deal
display
the
same
persistence
and
determination
that
would
always
set
him
apart
from
other
trader
rich
set
out
to
take
on
the
oil
business
oil
be
a
product
that
be
move
in
huge
quantity
and
have
a
big
value
but
it
hadn
t
be
trade
in
a
transparent
and
competitive
market
i
just
thought
it
should
be
possible
to
trade
oil
despite
the
seven
sister
rich
told
me
if
i
see
a
situation
in
the
market
and
it
make
sense
to
me
then
i
do
something
about
it
the
seven
sister
the
seven
sister
be
the
nickname
for
the
seven
company
that
dominate
the
world
s
international
oil
trade
in
the
mid
twentieth
century
the
american
chevron
esso
standard
oil
of
new
jersey
gulf
mobil
and
texaco
british
petroleum
and
the
anglo
dutch
shell
in
the
s
the
world
of
oil
be
quite
different
from
what
it
be
today
oil
be
not
trade
accord
to
free
market
principle
and
there
be
very
little
latitude
for
price
dynamic
oil
produce
nation
sell
nearly
all
of
their
oil
to
the
seven
sister
at
fix
price
agree
upon
far
in
advance
up
to
two
year
and
only
around
percent
of
crude
oil
be
trade
freely
accord
to
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
whoever
want
to
buy
oil
have
to
deal
directly
with
the
corporation
only
rarely
do
the
major
oil
corporation
trade
on
short
notice
on
the
open
market
when
they
want
to
sell
a
temporary
surplus
or
to
correct
an
unexpected
shortage
for
example
the
seven
sister
domination
of
the
global
oil
trade
after
the
second
world
war
extend
vertically
as
well
as
horizontally
they
control
every
aspect
of
production
and
distribution
range
from
extraction
at
the
well
refining
and
transport
to
the
gas
station
where
the
oil
be
sell
as
gasoline
the
seven
sister
form
what
economist
call
an
oligopoly
a
situation
that
exists
when
there
be
only
a
handful
of
supplier
that
dominate
the
market
they
be
able
to
dictate
price
independently
of
the
force
of
supply
and
demand
the
seven
sister
be
primarily
interested
in
secure
long
term
contract
at
fix
price
such
contract
allow
the
oil
oligopoly
to
control
both
oil
price
and
distribution
more
easily
the
seven
sister
dominance
meant
that
the
oil
industry
be
under
the
tight
control
of
american
and
european
oil
corporation
these
company
control
three
fourth
of
the
oil
that
be
not
produce
in
the
united
state
or
in
communist
country
their
profit
margin
be
huge
compare
to
those
of
other
industry
it
only
cost
to
produce
a
barrel
forty
two
gallon
of
oil
and
deliver
it
to
the
united
state
but
the
seven
sister
could
demand
price
of
a
barrel
or
more
of
their
buyer
the
price
for
a
barrel
of
oil
remain
more
or
less
constant
to
per
barrel
from
to
it
tend
to
rise
slightly
in
time
of
crisis
such
as
during
the
korean
war
or
the
six
day
war
this
situation
must
have
be
a
great
annoyance
to
the
oil
produce
nation
as
the
price
for
industrial
good
have
increase
considerably
over
the
same
period
of
time
not
only
do
the
oil
produce
nation
receive
a
relatively
low
price
for
their
oil
the
money
they
receive
from
their
oil
export
also
decline
in
value
when
compare
to
their
expenditure
on
import
good
it
be
something
of
a
paradox
the
demand
for
oil
have
increase
steadily
since
the
second
world
war
but
when
compare
to
the
oil
produce
nation
purchasing
power
the
price
of
oil
from
to
actually
sank
by
almost
percent
this
meant
the
industrial
nation
be
profit
from
the
low
price
or
in
comparative
term
the
fall
price
for
oil
and
energy
a
wave
of
oil
nationalization
the
oil
produce
nation
attempt
to
break
this
trend
and
at
the
same
time
strengthen
their
hand
against
the
oil
company
the
country
of
iran
iraq
kuwait
saudi
arabia
and
venezuela
have
already
found
the
organization
of
the
petroleum
export
country
opec
in
they
come
together
in
order
to
counter
the
pressure
exert
by
the
oil
company
who
want
to
keep
both
the
price
of
oil
and
the
royalty
payment
as
low
as
possible
in
the
early
year
opec
be
commit
to
negotiate
a
large
share
of
the
oil
company
profit
for
themselves
as
well
as
great
control
over
production
quota
in
the
s
opec
call
for
wide
scale
nationalization
of
the
member
state
oil
field
but
the
member
state
would
do
very
little
to
realize
these
idea
over
the
next
ten
year
however
the
situation
suddenly
explode
in
the
s
and
within
a
short
period
of
time
the
entire
oil
trade
have
be
shaken
to
its
very
foundation
this
radical
break
with
the
past
have
its
root
in
two
important
development
in
august
president
richard
nixon
abandon
the
gold
standard
whereupon
the
dollar
immediately
lose
to
percent
of
its
value
against
most
other
currency
as
the
global
oil
trade
be
base
on
dollar
this
meant
that
the
oil
produce
nation
be
earn
even
less
real
income
in
term
of
purchasing
power
in
effect
these
country
have
to
spend
more
of
the
devalue
dollar
they
have
exchange
for
oil
to
purchase
good
on
the
international
market
several
important
oil
produce
country
now
begin
nationalize
their
domestic
oil
industry
the
north
african
nation
of
algeria
be
the
first
to
do
so
in
and
it
be
soon
follow
by
neighbor
libya
the
floodgate
be
open
when
iraq
one
of
the

through

the

nationalize
all

within
only
a
few
year
the
dynamic
of

within
the

have
be
completely
turn
on
their

forever
today
in
the

be
the

at
the

in
no
one
could
have
expect
such
a
radical
shakeup
of
the
global
oil

but
the
write
be
on
the
wall
for
those
who
could
read
it
development
in
the
oil
market
offer
opportunity
for
those
who
be
the
first
to
recognize
them
and
be
willing
to
take
the
risk
as
history
have
show
time
of
upheaval
and
insecurity
usually
provide
good
picking
for
commodity
trader
an
increase
in
insecurity
and
volatility
within
a
commodity
market
go
hand
in
hand
with
an
increase
demand
for
independent
trader
who
can
guarantee
supply
for
solid
cash
these
trader
allow
buyer
to
compensate
for
market
fluctuation
alan
flack
be
the
first
trader
at
phillip
brother
to
break
into
the
oil
trade
but
he
held
back
from
take
these
trade
to
the
next
step
he
have
no
experience
deal
with
the
particular
problem
inherent
in
the
oil
trade
the
notion
of
take
risk
be
as
foreign
to
him
as
it
be
for
the
entire
company
and
this
idea
be
clearly
reflect
in
the
philipp
brother
german
motto
besser
gut
schlafen
al
gut
essen
it
be
well
to
sleep
well
than
eat
well
the
principle
be
drum
into
employee
that
it
be
well
to
avoid
a
lucrative
deal
if
the
risk
involve
be
high
enough
that
they
might
endanger
the
entire
company
in
this
respect
marc
rich
be
more
aggressive
than
his
boss
and
it
be
this
fear
of
risk
among
other
thing
that
would
later
lead
rich
to
leave
philipp
brother
in
order
to
found
his
own
company
i
be
the
right
person
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
he
told
me
as
if
that
be
all
there
be
to
it
i
be
work
in
a
commodity
trading
house
and
the
oligopoly
of
the
seven
sister
be
come
to
a
halt
suddenly
the
world
need
a
new
system
of
bring
the
oil
from
the
produce
country
to
the
consume
country
so
that
s
exactly
what
i
do
rich
realize
that
if
the
oil
produce
country
wish
to
break
the
dominance
of
the
corporation
they
would
need
independent
trader
like
him
they
simply
do
not
have
the
mean
the
marketing
know
how
the
establish
distribution
channel
contact
to
the
refinery
to
market
the
oil
themselves
rich
knew
that
he
could
offer
all
of
these
by
utilize
philipp
brother
worldwide
organization
he
want
to
repeat
the
success
he
have
enjoy
trading
mercury
he
want
to
create
a
market
yet
rich
have
to
deal
with
three
important
problem
first
he
have
to
get
the
oil
then
he
have
to
find
a
buyer
the
most
difficult
problem
of
them
all
be
the
delivery
how
could
he
get
the
oil
to
the
buyer
the
handle
and
transportation
of
oil
be
much
more
complicate
and
expensive
than
transport
metal
oil
be
a
liquid
with
vary
degree
of
viscosity
and
it
can
easily
be
lose
as
a
result
of
evaporation
or
leakage
the
physical
characteristic
of
oil
can
change
during
transportation
and
accord
to
temperature
oil
be
also
trade
in
huge
quantity
and
that
meant
one
need
a
lot
of
credit
oil
require
special
ship
and
oil
trade
be
conduct
more
quickly
than
other
commodity
trade
whereas
the
time
of
delivery
be
not
as
crucial
when
it
come
to
trading
in
bauxite
manganese
or
copper
time
be
of
the
essence
when
it
come
to
the
oil
trade
every
trader
know
that
the
most
important
element
of
a
deal
be
the
execution
of
the
trade
one
of
the
world
s
most
experienced
traffic
manager
introduce
me
to
the
art
of
trade
execution
like
many
of
my
interviewee
he
wish
to
remain
anonymous
he
even
insist
that
i
leave
the
name
of
our
meeting
place
out
of
this
book
i
want
to
know
why
he
felt
such
an
intense
need
for
secrecy
it
s
well
for
me
and
my
business
if
no
one
know
who
i
be
he
told
me
straight
out
as
a
trader
it
be
possible
to
close
a
fantastic
deal
he
say
but
it
isn
t
worth
anything
if
the
execution
go
wrong
even
bad
every
mistake
can
spell
disaster
i
ve
see
it
all
for
example
you
might
have
a
bad
letter
of
credit
that
result
in
the
cargo
be
deliver
much
later
than
plan
or
not
at
all
or
you
might
charter
a
ship
and
suddenly
the
ship
be
not
allow
to
enter
the
destination
port
the
deal
would
fall
through
and
you
might
lose
million
or
have
to
pay
enormous
demurrage
or
storage
fee
all
because
you
didn
t
do
your
homework
pincus
green
if
rich
want
to
get
into
the
oil
business
with
the
goal
of
create
a
free
market
he
would
need
an
expert
in
trade
execution
he
knew
he
need
his
own
logistics
system
and
he
knew
immediately
who
be
most
qualify
to
set
up
such
a
system
pincus

of
the
most
important
people

speak
he
have
be

the

conservative
and
warn

of
the
potential
danger
they
be
aware
of
the
inherent
risk
in

spell
ruin
for
a
company

have
an
idea
that
would
later
prove
to
be
a
stroke
of
genius
this
idea
would
soon
transform
philipp
brother
into
a
powerhouse
of
the
international
oil
trade
and
it
speaks
volume
about
rich
and
his
success
he
suggest
a
deal
between
two
party
who
at
least
officially
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
one
another
it
be
a
highly
secretive
and
politically
explosive
deal
which
remains
shroud
in
secrecy
to
this
day
i
first
heard
of
the
deal
when
i
interviewed
rich
s
former
high
rank
employee
in
madrid
i
have
want
to
know
how
rich
have
manage
to
break
into
the
oil
trading
business
so
quickly
i
get
along
quite
well
with
one
of
these
trader
due
to
a
share
passion
for
africa
we
be
discuss
whether
africa
would
one
day
be
able
to
pull
itself
out
of
its
poverty
and
misery
and
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
continent
could
only
do
so
on
its
own
and
not
with
the
help
of
foreign
aid
suddenly
he
make
a
tap
gesture
with
his
index
finger
and
ask
me
to
turn
off
my
tape
recorder
under
the
pledge
of
secrecy

proceed
to
tell
me
an
almost
unbelievable
tale

when
i
ask
him
about
the

business
rich
only
star
at
me
for
a
wordless
moment
it
seem
he
be
consider
whether
or
not
he
should
admit
to
this
secret
he
then
confess
to
me
that
the
pipeline
be
indeed
a
milestone
of
his
career
a
very
very
important
business
as
rich
put
it
thanks
to
the
relationship
with
oil
director
parviz
mina
and
mr
steel
ali
rezai
he
start
it
in
rich
can
no
longer
say
exactly
how
much
oil
he
trade
in
the
begin
he
still
know
that
he
be
able
to
expand
the
business
with
iran
over
the
year
up
to
to
million
ton
per
year
approximately
to
million
barrel
people
be
reluctant
to
use
the
pipeline
because
the
oil
have
pass
through
israel
rich
told
me
whoever
do
official
business
with
israel
ran
the
risk
of
be
blacklist
by
arab
nation
still
the
pipeline
be
there
i
decide
that
it
be
attractive
and
gradually
introduce
it
rich
secretly
transport
the
politically
controversial
oil
some
of
it
in
israeli
tanker
across
the
mediterranean
to
spain
rich
s
adopt
country
in
order
to
disguise
the
oil
s
origin
the
tanker
sometimes
stop
in
romania
the
communist
country
since
rule
by
the
dictator
nicolae
ceauescu
be
the
only
eastern
bloc
nation
that
have
not
broken
diplomatic
relation
with
israel
in
the
wake
of
the
six
day
war
there
be
a
reason
for
such
discretion
as
mention
earlier
spain
s
fascist
head
of
state
generalissimo
francisco
franco
have
consistently
refuse
to
officially
recognize
israel
but
he
be
very
interested
in
obtain
oil
spain
have
an
incredible
thirst
for
oil
as
a
result
of
the
nation
s
industrialization
couple
with
the
economic
boom
of
the
spanish
miracle
in
the
s
as
be
often
the
case
pragmatism
usually
win
out
over
ideology
in
such
situation
spain
bought
the
oil
even
though
it
have
no
diplomatic
relation
with
israel
an
insider
explain
politics
he
say
laughingly
and
shook
his
head
as
the
oil
be
relatively
cheap
rich
could
offer
it
at
price
that
be
low
than
those
of
the
competition
for
customer
who
might
have
be
concerned
about
the
oil
s
israeli
connection
this
be
a
decisive
financial
incentive
there
be
a
big
price
advantage
rich
explain
the
oil
be
cheaper
because
of
the
much
cheaper
freight
the
transport
of
iranian
crude
through
the
pipeline
be
much
cheaper
than
go
all
the
way
around
africa
a
metric
ton
of
iranian
oil
cost
in
eilat
the
same
oil
cost
once
it
have
be
transport
to
europe
via
the
cape
of
good
hope
at
that
time
the
usual
route
through
the
suez
canal
be
not
possible
due
to
egypt
s
closure
of
the
canal
from
to
rich
gain
access
to
franco
s
government
by
mean
of
his
economist
friend
alfredo
santos
blanco
he
be
very
helpful
to
me
rich
say
he
knew
everybody
and
everybody
knew
him
thanks
to
him
we
come
into
contact
with
the
spanish
government
and
the
spanish
refinery
who
eventually
become
our
customer
santos
blanco
who
in
would
become
spain
s
minister
of
industry
even
go
on
to
join
rich
s
company
as
a
public
relation
man
after
leave
office
rich
have
won
the
privilege
to
supply
spain
because
he
have
be
able
to
solve
a
problem
between
spain
and
egypt
egypt
owe
spain
a
substantial
sum
of
money
that
it
be
unable
to
pay
back
rich
arrange
to
buy
egyptian
oil
for
spain
and
use
part
of
that
credit
for
the
purchase
as
compensation
from
spain
for
this
business
they
give
me
a
part
of
the
government
quota
to
supply
them
rich
explains
as
be
true
of
many
country
the
spanish
government
control
a
set
percentage
of
all
oil
import
rich
sell
the
pipeline
oil
for
countless
year
to
the
spanish
government
as
part
of
this
government
quota
of
percent
yes
the
pipeline
be
very
important
to
me
rich
repeat
and
close
the
door
on
the
topic
the
story
be
evidence
of
rich
s
close
cooperation
with
iran
israel
and
spain
it
be
a
cooperation
of
great
value
to
all
involve
whose
importance
will
be
explain
in
the
follow
chapter
it
underscore
rich
s
contact
in
israel
s
intelligence
service
mossad
there
be
very
few
deal
that
have
as
great
an
effect
on
rich
as
the
pipeline
business
it
prove
to
rich
that
he
could
trust
his
instinct
once
again
rich
be
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
and
have
make
the
right
decision
it
be
no
small
risk
give
the
political
controversy
surround
israel
but
the
risk
prove
to
be
manageable
most
important
however
the
deal
have
paid
off
in
the
early
s
philipp
brother
become
one
of
the
world
s
large
oil
trading
company
almost
overnight
and
rich
create
the
beginning
of
a
spot
market
for
oil
that
he
would
later
perfect
in
his
own
company
he
sell
most
of
the
oil
to
spain
but
also
to
italy
and
mid
size
oil
company
in
the
united
state
it
be
a
novel
development
oil
could
now
be
bought
on
the
spot
on
short
notice
with
no
need
for
long
term
contract
or
other
obligation
to
the
major
company
or
oil
sheik
rich
s
ability
to
bring
together
improbable
business
partner
would
soon
become
his
trademark
he
would
repeatedly
serve
his
client
as
a
discreet
go
between
a
kind
of
crude
oil
middleman
it
would
prove
again
and
again
to
be
the
most
lucrative
kind
of
deal
in
time
of
crisis
government
be
prepared
to
pay
a
premium
for
strategically
important
commodity
such
as
oil
rich
carve
out
a
niche
for
himself
that
would
allow
him
to
make
contact
and
gather
experience
in
the
oil
trade
on
a
grand
scale
the
contact
he
make
would
soon
allow
him
to
leave
philipp
brother
and
found
his
own
company
thanks
to
israel
and
spain
and
iran
of
course
rich
would
soon
ascend
the
throne
to
become
the
undisputed
king
of
oil
yom
kippur
war
knowledge
be
power
this
be
probably
more
true
of
the
commodity
trade
than
of
any
other
field
with
the
exception
of
the
military
the
difference
between
wealth
and
wreckage
usually
depends
on
access
to
superior
information
the
contact
that
rich
and
green
have
make
in
iran
be
worth
their
weight
in
black
gold
thanks
to
these
excellent
relation
rich
learn
early
in
the
s
that
the
oil
produce
country
be
incense
the
high
inflation
rate
couple
with
the
massive
devaluation
of
the
dollar
make
their
income
from
oil
sale
plummet
in
spring
rich
and
green
heard
of
the
new
structure
loom
in
the
oil
industry
as
well
as
of
opec
s
desire
to
raise
price
before
the
competition
have
gotten
wind
of
it
i
wouldn
t
call
it
inside
information
but
direct
information
one
oil
trader
who
be
involve
in
the
iranian
deal
told
me
contrary
to
the
other
company
we
be
on
the
spot
we
be
there
contrary
to
them
we
get
all
the
information
available
in
the
market
rich
saw
the
opportunity
that
others
have
fail
to
see
we
felt
the
market
be
change
the
whole
world
be
change
he
recall
we
knew
more
than
our
competitor
of
course
i
always
develop
relation
with
my
customer
green
be
once
more
in
iran
in
spring
when
he
heard
that
nioc
want
to
sell
oil
on
the
free
market
we
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
take
a
long
position
in
crude
they
bet
on
high
price
and
sign
a
long
term
contract
with
iran
without
consult
their
boss
at
philipp
brother
in
new
york
accord
to
rich
they
commit
themselves
to
purchasing
a
total
of
one
million
metric
ton
approximately
million
barrel
over
a
long
period
of
time
at
a
fix
price
namely
per
barrel
the
total
value
of
the
deal
be
million
philipp
brother
president
ludwig
jesselson
be
shock
when
he
be
inform
of
the
deal
how
could
you
do
that
he
yell
at
rich
five
dollar
per
barrel
be
at
least
more
than
the
oil
s
market
price
at
the
time
bad
still
it
be
not
a
back
to
back
deal
for
rich
and
green
do
not
have
a
buyer
for
the
huge
quantity
of
oil
in
other
word
philipp
brother
carry
the
entire
risk
at
a
price
that
be
million
high
than
the
market
price
this
risk
be
intolerable
for
jesselson
who
still
live
accord
to
the
company
motto
it
be
well
to
sleep
well
than
eat
well
there
follow
a
marathon
series
of
telephone
conference
sometimes
heat
at
other
time
downright
nasty
but
the
upshot
be
that
jesselson
force
rich
and
green
to
get
rid
of
the
oil
as
quickly
as
possible
it
be
very
annoy
say
rich
they
have
no
choice
but
they
obeyed
their
order
reluctantly
pinky
sell
the
oil
to
ashland
oil
in
kentucky
for
a
small
profit
they
take
over
the
contract
too
bad
say
rich
he
perceive
jesselson
s
behavior
as
a
breach
of
trust
and
a
rejection
it
be
a
foreshadow
of
the
final
split
with
philipp
brother
that
be
soon
to
come
it
must
have
be
one
of
the
best
deal
in
the
history
of
ashland
oil
for
rich
and
green
be
prove
right
only
month
after
the
sale
on

israel
the

brought
israel
to
the

of

defeat
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
the
soviet
union
support
egypt

syria
whereas
the

the
side
of
the

the

only
manage

as
a
weapon
this
tactic
may
have
fail
miserably
during
the
six
day

but
the
political
and
economic
situation
be
different
this

libya

also
around

the
emergency
petroleum
allocation
act
which
introduce
control
on

fetch
anything
up
to
the
then
record
level
of
over
more
than

credit

the
lifeline

marc

co
as
it
have
practically
no
cash
and
no

therefore
the

most
important
goal
be
to
obtain
sufficient
credit
to
allow
it

for
which
it
charge
a

upon
repeatedly

the

how
green
be
able
to
utilize
such

the

an
oil
trader
told
me
the
result
be
that
from
the
mid
s
onward

freely
more
efficiently

at
more

ever
before

the
fix

could
be
use
more
efficiently
than
under
the
multinational
oil
company
and
government
thanks
to
independent
oil
trader
like
marc
rich
rich
be
able
to
achieve
what
the
seven
sister
could
not
manage
because
of
competitive
pressure
and
cost
structure
for
example
rich
could
sell
one
half
of
a
tanker
full
of
oil
to
a
buyer
in
spain
and
the
other
half
to
the
same
buyer
s
competitor
in
the
united
state
both
buyer
enjoy
the
benefit
of
cheaper
bulk
transport
that
they
never
could
have
afford
or
utilized
to
full
capacity
on
their
own
buyer
for
any
possible
surplus
could
be
found
much
more
quickly
and
supply
gap
be
easy
to
fill
in
short
supply
and
demand
could
be
balance
much
more
efficiently
the
spot
market
brought
with
it
an
increase
in
productivity
that
help
to
turn
the
entire
industry
inside
out
oil
be
now
precisely
what
rich
have
predict
only
a
few
year
before
just
another
commodity
marc
rich
invent
the
concept
of
the
independent
oil
trade
that
s
why
he
be
such
an
important
person
in
the
history
of
trade
an
expert
who
help
me
understand
the
technical
detail
of
the
oil
trade
told
me
rich
and
his
partner
put
the
very
same
theory
into
practice
that
economist
have
expound
for
year
skillful
trader
do
well
when
the
risk
be
high
and
the
supply
be
threaten
by
crisis
only
then
can
they
use
their
competitive
advantage
to
the
best
effect
trading
company
reduce
search
negotiation
and
transaction
cost
and
seem
likely
to
be
employ
at
least
initially
when
the
risk
of
international
trade
be
high
say
geoffrey
jones
a
professor
of
business
history
at
harvard
business
school
who
be
a
specialist
in
trading
company
trader
can
help
their
customer
by
compensate
for
a
lack
of
information
and
trust
anyone
who
have
ever
haggle
over
the
price
of
spice
or
carpet
in
an
arabian
bazaar
know
what
it
mean
to
try
to
purchase
good
without
a
reference

to
put
it
simply
experienced
commodity
trader
know
where
and
with
whom
they
have
to
trade
particularly
in
area
where
it
be
difficult
to
establish
a
contract
we
feel
that
the
trader
have
a
physical
role
to
play
that
of
manage
the
flow
of
commodity
both
in
time
and
in
space
in
a
universe
characterize
by
instability
it
be
this
very
instability
which
in
the
final
analysis
provide
the
raison
d
tre
of
trade
say
the
french
economics
professor
philippe
chalmin
an
expert
in
commodity
market
with
practical
experience
in
the
field
this
ability
to
deal
with
instability
and
in
turn
secure
a
stable
flow
of
oil
be
ironically
also
of
use
to
the
u

department
of

which
hire
marc
rich
co
as
a

in

not

marc

freedom
a

me
rather
dramatically
he
allow
me
to

what
i
be
when

someone
he
really

say
avner

s
secret
of
success
and
trust
also
present
an
economic
advantage
in
his
acclaim
book
trust
the
political
economist
francis
fukuyama
illustrates
how
the
degree
of
trust
in
a
society
and
indeed
in
a
company
can
be
decisive
for
both
its
prosperity
and
its
ability
to
compete
in
low
trust
society
such
as
china
france
or
italy
you
cannot
assume
that
everyone
be
follow
the
rule
member
of
these
society
must
always
renegotiate
these
rule
and
often
even
have
to
go
to
court
to
do
so
in
high
trust
society
such
as
germany
or
japan
however
businesspeople
be
more
willing
to
trust
that
everyone
hold
to
the
same
value
whereby
deception
be
not
accepted
a
high
degree
of
reciprocal
trust
substantially
lower
the
cost
of
business
it
be
much
easy
for
large
and
successful
private
enterprise
to
blossom
in
society
with
a
high
degree
of
social
trust
the
distinguish
economist
and
nobel
prize
winner
kenneth
j
arrow
characterizes
trust
as
an
important
lubricant
of
a
social
system
it
be
extremely
efficient
it
save
a
lot
of
trouble
to
have
a
fair
degree
of
reliance
on
other
people
s
word
trust
and
similar
value
loyalty
and
truth
tell
be
example
of
what
the
economist
would
call
externality
they
be
good
they
be
commodity
they
have
real
practical
economic
value
they
increase
the
efficiency
of
the

i
experienced
rich
s
trust
firsthand
it
take
several
year
before
rich
agree
to
meet
with
me
however
when
he
decide
that
he
would
make
himself
available
for
this

he
give
me
free
rein
i
do
not
have
to
grapple
with
his

as
i
have
expect
he
do
not
insist
on
the
right
to
revise
my

dictum
meum

have
be
the
motto
of
the
london

since
rich
identifies
with
this
century
old
merchant
tradition
when
i
ask
him
about
his
most
important
leadership
principle
rich
answer
my
principle
be
to
perform
what
i
say
i
ll
do
performance
when
i
ask
robert
fink
who
have
serve
as

lawyer
for
many
year
about
his
client
s
strength
he
simply
look
at
me
for
some
time
without
say
a

it
seem
as
if
he
be
contemplate
whether
i
would
believe
his

then
say
rich
be
a
man
of
his

be
reliable
keep
your

honest
these
be
the
reason
he
be
successful
trust
and
dependability
be
decisive
factor
in
the
commodity

in
the

at
that

the

less

with
the

they
didn
t
have
any
objection
he
say
as
if
there
be
nothing
at
all
unusual
about
the
situation
i
have
ask
him
how
he
have
manage
to
gain
the
trust
of
the
new
khomeini
regime
even
though
he
have
work
closely
with
the
shah
s
government
his
laconic
answer
help
to
explain
why
trader
such
as
rich
exist
in
the
first
place
and
why
they
be
in
such
great
demand
we
perform
a
service
for
them
rich
explains
we
bought
the
oil
we
handle
the
transport
and
we
sell
it
they
couldn
t
do
it
themselves
so
we
be
able
to
do
it
the
more
experienced
and
successful
manager
at
nioc
during
the
reign
of
the
shah
flee
the
country
when
he
do
and
all
other
foreign
expert
have
already
left
the
new

have
no
experience
whatsoever
in
run
an
oil
company
they
be
appoint
to
head
the
company
for
ideological
and
theological
reason
not
for
their
expertise
they
be
completely
illiterate
in
even
the
most
basic
fundamental
of
the
commodity
trade
such
as
financing
insurance
lade
transport
and
unlade
they
be
certainly
not

remembers
i
ask
rich
if
the
new
director
at
nioc
have
depend
on
his
company
s
know
how
would
the
iranian
have
be
helpless
without
him
rich
laugh
they
didn
t
behave
that
way
but
in
a
way
it
s
true
rich
maintain
a
much
more
intensive
and
much
longer
business
relationship
with
iran
than
be
previously
know
it
be
a
relationship
that
extend
far
beyond
the
five
transaction
later
list
in

rudolph
w
giuliani
s
indictment
the
contract
with
iran
which
be
renew
yearly
remain
valid
throughout
the
hostage
crisis
it
be
a
political
development
which
do
not
affect
the
business
rich
say
it
be
very
unpleasant
and
tragic
for
the
hostage
and
humiliate
for
america
but
it
didn
t
affect
the
business
we
sell
oil
because
a
it
be
available
and
b
the
price
be
right
that
s
why
we
do
business
we
didn
t
force
anyone
to
either
buy
from
us
or
sell
it
to
us
in
both
case
the
seller
sell
it
to
us
because
it
suit
him
and
the
buyer
bought
it
because
it
suit
him
it
be
a
service
i
ask
him
how
long
he
do
business
with
iran
forever
he
explains
until
i
sell
my
company
to
the
management
in
we
have

available
and
our
competitor

not
the
second
global

by
his

nation
rich
have
gamble
that
the
political
situation
in
the
middle
east
would
remain
unstable
he
be
convince
that
the
oil
price
would
continue
to
rise
over
the
medium
term
he
therefore
continued
to
seek
out
new

and
be
ready
to
pay
good
price
for
long

iran

the
most
important

as
one
of
the
most
important
secret
of
his

it
be
always
clear
to
me
we
need
to
have
a
long

this
be
our
big
advantage
the

that
we

we
have

government
and
this
lead
switzerland
to
seek
out
a
more
pragmatic
solution
that
would
allow
both
country
to
save
face
when
he
walk
into
the
prosecutor
s
office
on
that
day
in
late
june
j
rg
leutert
be
prepared
to
make
giuliani
just
such
an
offer
leutert
first
explain
that
the
swiss
government
have
no
interest
in
defend
the
interest
of
an
allege
tax
criminal
he
also
make
it
clear
however
that
switzerland
would
defend
its
sovereignty
and
would
never
allow
foreign
law
enforcement
agency
to
operate
on
swiss
soil
in
any
way
or
form
without
the
government
s
explicit
approval
swiss
company
be
subject
to
swiss
law
leutert
state
leutert
then
ask
giuliani
what
he
have
on
marc
rich
for
the
long
time
we
do
not
know
what
the
charge
against
rich
actually
be
be
it
tax
evasion
in
that
case
swiss
law
would
have
prevent
us
from
offering
legal
assistance
i
told
giuliani
if
it
be
tax
fraud
however
we
might
be
able
to
help
leutert
told
me
during
a
telephone
interview
from
brazil
where
he
serve
as
the
swiss
ambassador
for
several
year
and
now
run
a
management
consultancy
firm
switzerland
be
unique
when
it
come
to
differentiate
between
tax
evasion
and
tax
fraud
in
switzerland
the
intentional
failure
to
report
income
or
asset
on
a
tax
return
be
not
consider
a
crime
but
a
case
of
tax
evasion
which
be
dealt
with
use
only
administrative
sanction
tax
fraud
involve
criminal
sanction
take
place
when
income
be
fraudulently
identify
use
a
falsify
document
such
as
a
bank
statement
an
invoice
or
a
balance
sheet
in
there
be
basically
two
legal
instrument
available
to
foreign
prosecutor
ask
for
swiss
help
an
extradition
treaty
sign
in
and
the
new
swiss
federal
act
on
international
mutual
assistance
in
criminal
matter
imac
which
have
come
into
effect
on
january
leutert
provide
giuliani
with
a
detailed
explanation
of
how
he
should
proceed
imac
allow
the
exchange
of
information
document
detail
from
witness
interrogation
and
the
confiscation
of
asset
in
the
case
of
tax
fraud
even
more
interest
accord
to
the
agreement
extradition
be
possible
for
person
charge
with
counterfeit
or
forgery
of
public
or
private
document
the
fraudulent
use
of
counterfeit
or
forge
instrument
or
obtain
money
or
other
property
by
false
pretence
this
be
almost
the
exact
word
that
giluliani
would
later
use
in
the
indictment
against
rich
a
mysterious
lapse
within
the
framework
of
this
agreement
a
telephone
call
would
have
be
enough
recount
leutert
the
american
only
need
to
tell
us
that
they
have
a
huge
case
of
fraud
or
forgery
on
their
hand
involve
a
certain
marc
rich
living
in
switzerland
they
only
need
to
ask
us
could
you
please
arrest
him
pending
receipt
of
an
extradition
request
it
all
would
have
happen
fairly
quickly
after
that
and
swiss
police
would
have
take
marc
rich
into
provisional
custody
this
be
exactly
the
course
of
action
that
i
present
to
giuliani
it
be
a
very
good
conversation
last
two
hour
very
open
very
friendly
and
very
cooperative
giuliani
told
me
that
it
be
indeed
a
case
of
fraud
and
that
he
could
use
the
information
i
have
give
him
but
nothing
happen
giuliani
s
reason
for
fail
to
use
the
agreement
remain
a
mystery
for
me
to
this
day
under
the
term
of
imac
giuliani
could
have
write
a
letter
of
request
ask
the
swiss
government
to
hand
over
business
document
belonging
to
marc
rich
co
as
imac
take
precedence
over
swiss
bank
secrecy
provision
the
establish
channel
of
mutual
assistance
leutert
remind
giuliani
have
proven
extremely
successful
of
the
request
that
the
u
s
government
have
sent
to
switzerland
over
the
previous
six
year
the
swiss
government
have
grant
and
the
alpine
nation
have
never
reject
a
single
u
s
extradition
request
view
objectively
this
would
have
be
a
course
of
action
that
would
have
allow
prosecutor
to
arrest
rich
and
gain
access
to
his
covert
business
activity
giuliani
knew
this
of
course
and
at
the
september
press
conference
where
he
read
aloud
from
the
bill
of
indictment
he
announce
that
u
s
authority
would
file
a
request
for
extradition
in
fact
the
u
s
attorney
later
chose
a
different
strategy
a
strategy
that
be
much
more
likely
to
get
the
case
in
the
headline
giuliani
do
not
file
a
letter
of
request
but
instead
chose
to
let
the
case
escalate
he
want
to
prove
that
he
be
tough
on
white
collar
criminal
by
make
an
example
of
rich
he
want
to
play
hardball
the
affair
soon
erupt
into
the
bad
diplomatic
conflict
of
all
time
between
switzerland
and
the
united
state
culminate
in
an
open
diplomatic
clash
and
it
poison
relation
between
the
two
country
for
year
to
come
even
the
conservative
neue

a
rather
staid
swiss
daily
express
its
confusion
over
giuliani
s
mistake
the
reason
behind
the
united
state
decision
not
to
request
swiss
legal
assistance
at
the
very
begin
of
the
affair
as
be
usually
the
case
in
such
instance
and
give
that
such
assistance
can
normally
be
administer
without
difficulty
largely
remains
a
mystery
even
to
local
american
observer
the
internationally
respect
weekly
die
weltwoche
which
be
usually
rather
pro
american
in
tone
comment
it
be
not
entirely
clear
why
the
united
state
be
balking
at
the
due
process
of
law
it
be
possible
that
the
new
york
prosecutor
giuliani
be
seek
the
loud
possible
fanfare
for
his
dream
trial
that
involves
the
big
tax
fraud
in
the
history
of
the
united
state
the
stubborn
swiss
the
u
s
department
of
justice
finally
apply
for
swiss
legal
assistance
in
the
case
in
july
a
year
after
the
conversation
between
giuliani
and
leutert
and
ten
month
after
the
indictment
be
issue
a
short
time
later
the
united
state
demand
rich
s
extradition
however
the
daily
fine
of
be
not
withdrawn
despite
swiss
protest
the
swiss
authority
react
with
stubbornness
although
they
have
promise
a
speedy
handle
of
the
request
in
as
little
as
three
week
they
refuse
to
extradite
rich
and
held
back
from
deliver
the
request
document
the
swiss
office
for
police
matter
issue
an
official
explanation
state
that
it
deny
the
request
because
under
swiss
law
rich
s
action
qualify
as
fiscal
violation
and
violation
of
provision
concern
currency
trade
policy
and
economic
policy
this
be
only
half
true
however
the
swiss
government
have
long
cease
to
be
concerned
with
this
one
particular
case
against
rich
now
the
authority
be
more
concerned
with
issue
of
swiss
sovereignty
which
they
believe
be
be
abuse
by
u
s
action
legal
assistance
and
sanction
issue
by
a
foreign
government
be
mutually
exclusive
state
the
swiss
government
clearly
a
confidential
paper
issue
by
the
swiss
embassy
in
washington
on

warn
that
the
unilateral
act
of
coercion
carry
out
by
u
s
authority
on
swiss
soil
should
not
be

the
swiss
thus
make
their
promise
of
legal
assistance
dependent
on
american
respect
for
swiss
sovereignty
a
senior
top
swiss
official
involve
in
the
case
told
me
whoever
want
swiss
cooperation
cannot
simultaneously
ignore
swiss
law
by
employ
compulsory
measure
a
year
earlier
we
would
have
regard
an
arrest
request
with
great
favor
j
rg
leutert
for
his
part
remembers
a
walk
he
take
with
minister
of
justice
kurt
furgler
at
the
begin
of
the
affair
during
which
the
minister
told
him
point
blank
so
just
give
the
american
what
they
want
that
be
exactly
what
rich
s
lawyer
have
fear
most
as
they
be
well
aware
that
the
swiss
government
be
anxious
to
maintain
good
relation
with
the
united
state
the
extradition
request
be
the
bad
andr

told
me
at
least
we
could
avoid
marc
rich
and
pincus
green
be
arrest
pending
extradition
what
would
have
happen
if
giuliani
have
already
make
an
extradition
request
in
statement
make
by
swiss
diplomat
and
rich
s
lawyer
make
it
clear
that
rich
would
have
at
the
very
least
be
take
into
provisional
custody
pending
extradition
whether
the
charge
would
have
be
sufficient
to
allow
for
extradition
remains
open
for
debate
however
the
whole
story
and
rich
s
willingness
to
cooperate
would
certainly
have
take
a
much
different
course
in
the
event
giuliani
the
canny
attorney
who
always
knew
what
be
best
for
his
own
career
let
this
unique
opportunity
to
have
rich
arrest
slip
through
his
finger
american
legal
isolationism
the
american
authority
be
aware
of
the
importance
of
a
provisional
arrest
usually
the
key
to
a
successful
extradition
be
the
provisional
arrest
of
the
fugitive
alvin
d
lodish
later

in
this

after
the

have
be
perfect
the
requirement
for
provisional

be
significantly
less
burdensome
than
the
requirement
for
the
full
extradition
giuliani
s
tough
guy
bearing
get
in
the
way
of
all
this
it
be
one
of
the
early
case
of
american
legal
and
political
isolationism
the
tendency
of
the
american
government
to
ignore
other
jurisdiction
it
be
a
strategy
that
lead
the
united
state
into
a
blind
alley
in
retrospect
it
be
strike
how
the
most
powerful
nation
on
earth
proceed
without
forge
alliance
without
have
a
comprehensive
strategy
without

it
be
therefore
not

that

soon
come
to
the
conclusion
that

not

the
commentary

to
the
point
the

have
antagonize

also
highlight
by
the
british
economist

neale
a
world
authority
on

it
be
hard
to
avoid
the

that
claim

u

jurisdiction
which
have
encroach
on
the
sovereign

have
largely
be
a
disaster
for
the

in

the
insistence
of

a
curiously
negligent
approach
to

the

held
by
the
associate
u

be
wholly
ineffective
why
be
giuliani
and
weinberg
so
uncooperative
in
their
dealing
with
swiss
authority
why
do
they
fail
to
take
advantage

so
many
opportunity
why
do
they
choose
to
allow

up
the

weinberg
answer
after
a
brief
pause
the
swiss
action
help
me
too
many
mistake
the
prosecution
s
lapse
in
the
case
certainly
played
no
small
role
in
rich
remain
at
large
even
wicki
rich
s
swiss
lawyer
be
surprised
and
relieve
by
the
prosecution
s
behavior
the
u
s
government
never
challenged
the
decision
of
the
swiss
government
not
to
extradite
marc
rich
neither
do
it
renew
its
extradition
request
both
of
these
step
could
have
be
take
without
difficulty
the
second
extradition
request
would
have
only
need
to
list
the
charge
that
be
punishable
in
both
country
such
as
fraud
or
forgery
as
leutert
have
suggest
to
giuliani
year
later
in
the
high
power
house
committee
on
government
operation
set
up
an
investigation
to
determine
why
marc
rich
and
pinky
green
have
never
be
apprehend
the
committee
come
to
the
same
conclusion
and
raise
serious
allegation
concern
the
authority
action
it
appear
that
no
effort
be
make
to
charge
additional
crime
that
might
be
extraditable
or
to
extradite
on
few
offense
there
be
also
a
possibility
that
the
u
s
government
may
have
miss
opportunity
to
investigate
potential
additional
violation
of
the
law
which
would
be
more
easily
extraditable
u
s
authority
also
never
sent
an
extradition
request
to
spain
and
israel
where
rich
travel
frequently
he
often
spent
summer
holiday
in
the
south
of
spain
with
his
family
in
his
villa
in
marbella
and
while
he
may
initially
have
pursue
only
business
interest
in
israel
he
more
and
more
often
visit
for
the
purpose
of
further
his
philanthropic
activity
there
as
evidence
of
the
investigator
halfhearted
almost
naive
approach
to
rich
s
extradition
the
department
of
justice
in
the
early
s
be
not
even
sure
whether
rich
actually
held
israeli
citizenship
it
have
simply
neglect
to
address
the
issue
back
in
the
department
have
ask
israel
to
arrest
rich
the
next
time
he
visit
the
country
but
it
be
ten
year
before
the
answer
come
no
the
demand
michael
ben
yair
then
israel
s
attorney
general
explain
be
not
follow
by
an
extradition
request
or
a
copy
of
the
charge
and
affidavit
we
consider
the
issue
and
found
it
have
no
legal
validity
the
charge
against
mr
rich
be
fiscal
and
not
fraud
related
and
therefore
the
extradition
treaty
between
the
two
country
do
not
cover
his
case
u
s
authority
do
not
even
attempt
to
have
rich
extradite
from
spain
as
they
simply
assume
that
the
country
do
not
allow
the
extradition
of
its
own
citizen
the
fact
that
u
s
authority
be
satisfied
with
this
assumption
be
harshly
criticize
by
the
house
committee
these
citizenship
be
acquire
after
the
date
in
which
the
crime
be
allege
to
have
be
commit
thus
their
nationality
should
not
be
a
bar
to
extradition
furthermore
the
u
s
national
central
bureau
of
interpol
do
not
issue
an
international
red

no

three

after
the

traditionally
played
a
very
important
role
in

and
all
law

expert
know
that
the
sooner
a

the
great
the
chance
that
the

will
be
detain
the
sheer
number
of
mistake
and
delayed
action
on
the
behalf
of
the
prosecution
would
appear
to
indicate
that
giuliani
weinberg
and
their
successor
be
in
no
way
inconvenienced
by
the
fact
that
rich
and

be
never
apprehend
the
situation
be
quite
clear
to
the
house
committee
the
united

lack
the
political
will
to
effect
the
return
of
these
fugitive
not
presume
innocent
marc
rich
be
never
convict
the
case
never
have
the
opportunity
to
go
to
trial
as
rich
never
return
to
the
united

no
court
ever
issue
a
ruling
on
the
validity
of
the
government
s
charge
against
him
if
we
be
to
follow
the
time
honor
american
tradition
of
innocent
until
proven
guilty
then
rich
must
be
consider
innocent
the
reality
be
something
entirely
different
rich
be
judged
both
before
the
medium
and
in
the
court
of
public
opinion
and
many
journalist
and
politician
have
make
statement
that
violate
rich
s
right
to
be
presume
innocent
over
the
course
of
time
rich
have
be
transform
from
a
suspect
and
defendant
into
a
fraudster
and
an
enemy
of
the
state
and
none
of
these
accusation
have
ever
be
proven
in
court
even
prosecutor
sandy
weinberg
found
that
rich
have
be
tarnished
and
taint
and
represent
basically
as
one
of
the
world
s
great
criminal
it
be
the
purpose
of
this
book
not
to
prove
rich
s
guilt
or
innocence
but
to
pose
question
and
to
point
out
the
mistake
make
throughout
the
entire
affair
by
all
side
the
legal
situation
be
not
as
clear
as
the

case
described
in

previous
chapter
of
this
book
in
fact
some
of
the

top
legal
expert
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the

their

in
this
indictment
jack
quinn
told
the
house
committee
the
case
be
fundamentally
flaw
quinn
still
be
convince
as
he
write
to
president
clinton
of
both
marc
s
innocence
and
the
outrageously
prejudicial
and
unfair
treatment
of
him
by
the
then
new
u
s
attorney
in
new
york
mr
guiliani
sic
of
course
it
be
the
lawyer
task
to
present
their
client
in
the
best
possible
manner
and
whoever
intend
to
weigh
up
such
argument
must
take
this
fact
into
consideration
it
be
strike
however
that
these
argument
have
generally
be
ignore
in
the
year
since
the
indictment
by
the
press
and
even
more
so
by
the
judiciary
see
chapter
the
reason
for
this
lack
of
discussion
be
probably
that
opinion
have
already
be
form
rich
be
described
as
the
great
tax
fraudster
in
the
history
of
the
united
state
and
any
other
description
would
have
be
see
as
politically
incorrect
for
whatever
reason
journalist
and
commentator
usually
left
out
the
adjective
allege
or
accuse
those
who
fought
against
white
collar
criminal
and
organize
crime
be
the
hero
of
the
s
and
s
rudy
giuliani
be
celebrate
in
the
tabloid
as
the
modern
incarnation
of
eliot
ness
the
legendary
chicago
crime
fighter
who
go
up
against
al
capone
rich
on
the
other
hand
be
the
bad
guy
who
make
huge

at
a
time
when

at
the

face
with

inflation
as
a
result
of
soar
oil

and
american
citizen
be
be
held
hostage
by
rich
s
most
important
business
partner
iran
to
put
it
mildly
rich
be
not
exactly
go
to
win
the
heart
and
mind
of
the
american
public
as
a
longtime
oil
trader
prosaically
put
it
when
the
market
turn
sour
many
people
look
for
someone
to
blame
an
additional
problem
be
the
fact
that
rich
be
a
tangible
individual
who
the
public
could
easily
comprehend
his
company
carry
his
name
whereas
most
other
oil
company
be
publicly
trade
company
with
countless
anonymous
stockholder
furthermore
the
public
be
suspicious
of
commodity
trader
in
general
if
only
because
they
be
capable
of
move
billion
of
dollar
worth
of
good
and
earn
million
of
dollar
for
themselves
arm
with
nothing
but
an
address
book
a
telephone
and
a
plane
ticket
rich
s
obstruction
at
the
time
no
one
in
the
medium
be
interested
in
tell
the
story
from
rich
s
perspective
this
be
in
part
due
to
rich
s
catastrophic
communication
strategy
which
be
completely
unable
to
gauge
the
medium
reality
of
the
day
rich
s
relationship
to
the
medium
could
at
time
only
be
described
as
paranoid
for
year
rich
give
hardly
any
interview
and
he
be
not
in
the
habit
of
return
journalist
phone
call
this
of
course
meant
that
rich
could
neither
dispute
nor
comment
on
anything
that
have
be
write
about
him
for
the
most
part
rich
fail
even
to
communicate
his
belief
in
his
own
innocence
this
cement
rich
s
image
in
the
eye
of
the
public
a
secretive
trader
with
something
to
hide
a
man
who
will
not
defend
himself
because
there
must
be
something
behind
all
the
allegation
his
pr
adviser
have
not
kept
up
with
the
time
and
in
the
end
they
do
him
more
harm
than
good
the
legal
team
s
incomprehensible
obstructive
strategy
particularly
early
on
help
to
blow
the
case
completely
out
of
proportion
the
stonewall
the
steamer
trunk
affair
and
the
apparent
sale
and
subsequent
rename
of
mri
as
clarendon
all
do
nothing
to
convince
either
the
prosecution
or
the
public
jack

later
sum
up
the
situation
mr
rich
s
defense

a
most
unfortunate

no
cooperation
no
negotiation
strategy
he
write
in
a
letter
to
one
of
giuliani
s
successor
it
be
an
expensive
but
ill
advise
strategy
there
be
very
few
dissident
voice
among
those
member
of
the
medium
who
refuse
to
go
along
with
the
herd
one
of
the
most
prominent
journalist
who
be
not
afraid
to
express
his
opinion
be
gordon
crovitz

crovitz

this
be
the
much
celebrate
case
against
marc
rich
the
wealthy
oil
trader
a
close
reading
of
the
allegation
show
that
these
effectively
reduce
to
tax
charge
the
core
of
the
case
be
that
mr
rich
wrongly
attribute
domestic
income
to
a
foreign
subsidiary
again
this
sound
like
a
standard
civil
tax
case
not

mr

genius
laurence
urgenson

without

the

that

only
one
effect
to
whip
up
the
fury

robert

who
have
serve
as

in

since
it

you
know
totally
disproportionate
rico

iran
be
so
emotionally
charge
the
government
intend
to
paint
rich
into
the
corner
it
would
be
easy
to
simply
discount
such
statement
as
lawyer
lobbying
on
their
client
s
behalf
but
public
reaction
to
the
charge
against
rich
prove
the
validity
of
their
statement
the
charge
of
trading
with
the
enemy
change
everything
all
of
the
anger
and
sadness
unleashed
by
the
iranian
hostage
crisis
rain
down
upon
rich
after
these
accusation
have
be
make
it
would
no
longer
be
possible
to
consider
the
case
solely
from
a
legal
point
of
view
it
be
no
longer
a
matter
of
legality
and
illegality
it
be
now
an
issue
of
morality
the
court
of
morality
know
no
rule
of
procedure
my
political
philosophy
professor
like
to
warn
they
don
t
pursue
exonerate
evidence
the
verdict
of
the
public
be
definite
there
be
no
appeal
he
flee
to
zug
to
live
in
luxury
and
he
dealt
with
the
iranian
while
they
be
torture
and
hold
our
people
hostage
this
be
not

guy

director

one
of
the

you
often
walk
on

be
careful
and
don

step
off
yet
i
be
not
convince
that

would
actually
have
be
found
guilty
in
court
there
be
simply
too
much
reasonable
doubt
surround
his
guilt
i
have
come
to
this
decision
after
my
conversation
with
member
of
the
judiciary
diplomat
and
other
individual
directly
involve
in
the
case
and
after
have
view
countless
document
some
of
which
be
confidential
as
my
research
have
clearly
illustrate
there
be
a
political
aspect
to
the
case
u
s
attorney
giuliani
knew
that
the
case
would
serve
as
a
springboard
for
his
political
career
a
career
that
would
lead
him
to
become
the
mayor
of
new
york
and
later
to
make
an
unsuccessful
bid
for
the
u
s
presidency
one
could
go
as
far
as
to
say
that
giuliani
s
political
and
very
public
career
actually
begin
with
this
case
as
history
have
show
the
fact
that
the
case
escalate
rapidly
before
virtually
explode
as

not
exactly

also
see
political
motivation
in
the
case
against

political
reason
may
underline
the
decision
to
prosecute
for

u

ban
he
do
in
the
end
plead
guilty
to
some
charge
but
skeptic
might
ask
themselves
whether
the
prosecution
would
have
occur
have
he
not

suddenly
seem
to
fall
by
a

when
i
want
to
discus
these
issue
with

it
be
one
of
the
few

in
which
the

have
to
struggle
with
his
composure

remain
polite
to
his
guest
this
come
as
no
surprise
the
question
get
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
fundamental
criticism
surround
the
case
we
do
this
investigation
in
a
very
professional
way
weinberg
say
with
a
study
calmness
we
ve
be
fair
we
didn
t
have
a
good
case
we
have
an
overwhelm
case
believe
me
i
know
how
to
make
a
case
if
jack
quinn
say
that
we
have
a
legal
house
of
card
well
it
be
all
ace
why
do
the
lawyer
wait
until
i
be
go
none
of
these
argument
be
raise
in
or
the
lawyer
never
come
in
and
say
there
be
no
crime
this
be
just
a
civil
case
what
do

have
to
say
about
the

analysis

out

reply
before
pause
as
if
he
be
completely
take
aback
by
his
own
rude
emotional
explosion
he
then
look
me
directly
in
the
eye
and
seem
to
consider
which
argument
would
have
the
great
effect
on
me
and
don
t
forget
he
say
don
t
forget
rich
s
company
plead
guilty
he
be
a
fugitive
if
this
case
be
so
flaw
why
didn
t
he
come
back
and
face
the
charge
an
excellent
question
a
question
that
only
rich
himself
can
and
indeed
will
answer
in
the
next
chapter
i
never
broke
the

and
throw
me
a
stern
look

that
make
him
such
a
good
look
man
in
his
young
year
one
can
see
a
strong
resemblance
to
rudolph

tragic
star
of
the
silent
film
era
in

earlier

barely
noticeable
lisp
he
be
always
precise
and
to
the
point
there
be
something
catlike
about
him
beyond
his
apparent
nine
life
he
cautiously
keep
his
distance
and
wait
ready
to
jump

might
be
ready
to
flee
or
attack
i
have
ask
him
his
opinion
of
rudolph
w
giuliani
his
nemesis
i
don
t
think

straight
i
think
he
s
only
interested
in
himself
that
s
it
rich
say
it
be
the
first
time
the
commodity
trader
have
spoken
openly
about
his
case
rich
do
not
attempt
to
outmaneuver
or
avoid
my
question
on
the
contrary
and
rather
surprisingly
for
someone
who
for
the
last
twenty
five
year
have
be
label
one
of
the
great
tax
fraudsters
rich
maintains
his
innocence
of
course
he
try
to
minimize
his
tax
he
admits
of
course
he
funnel
his
profit
to
switzerland
where
the
tax
burden
be
substantially
low
than
in
the
united
state
of
course
his
company
practice
transfer
pricing
every
international
company
do
rich
make
an
effort
not
to
sound
too
apologetic
when
stress
his
innocence
i
never
cross
the
border
of
legality
everything
i
do
be
perfectly
in
order
i
never
broke
the
law
i
do
nothing
wrong
a
scapegoat
be
need
for
the
first
time
ever
marc
rich
be
willing
to
discus
his
international
trading
activity
the
trading
with
the
enemy
charge
be
clearly
the
most
inflammatory
part
of
the
indictment
the
truth
be
far
different
rich
explains
i
be
do
business
with
iran
for
a
swiss
company
and
it
be
completely
legal
marc
rich
co
a
swiss
corporation
have
historically
purchase
oil
from
the
national
iranian
oil
company
before
the
overthrow
of
the
shah
and
the
seizure
of
american
hostage
we
then
resold
the
oil
on
the
world
market
like
all
other
foreign
base
oil
company
include
those
which
be
subsidiary
of
u

company
marc

continued
to
do
oil
business
with
the
national
iranian
oil
company
after
the
iranian
revolution
take
place
if
he
be
indeed
innocent
as
he
claim
i
interject
why
be
he
brand
the
great
tax
fraudster
and
an
enemy
of
the
state
rich
tilt
his
head
to
one
side
and
the
red
birthmark
on
his
left
cheek
seem
to
glow
brighter
than
usual
i
believe
it
be
a
combination
of
political
problem
and
that
a
scapegoat
be
need
at
the
time
rich
say
i
be
an
easy
target
one
individual
very
successful
make
a
lot
of
money
and
jewish
i
stood
outside
of
the
establishment
he
be
convince
that
he
be
single
out
for
precisely
these
reason
it
be
easy
for
prosecutor
he
think
to
go
after
him
rather
than
to
sift
through
the
hundred
of
public
company
with
their
anonymous
stockholder
that
often
employ
similar
practice
after
richard
nixon
introduce
price
regulation
for
crude
oil
in
oil
resellers
seem
to
sprout
up
everywhere
prior
to
the
arab
oil
embargo
there
be
only
twelve
oil
resellers
in
the
united
state
by
there
be
five
hundred
company
in
the
business
i
be
single
out
by
individual
individual
with
a
clear
personal
interest
in
self
promotion
rich
believe
mr
giuliani
escalate
the
case
because
he
saw
a
chance
to
achieve
more
publicity
for
himself
he
maintains
personal
interest
and
feeling
on
their
side
get
into
the
way
of
a
fair
solution
marc
rich
seem
almost
bashful
as
he
tell
me
this
i
be
remind
of
how
one
of
his
friend
once
explain
that
rich
be
actually
a
very
reserve
person
a
virtual
introvert
who
prefer
to
sit
quietly
in
the
corner
at
social
event
he
would
just
smoke
his
cigar
and
observe
other
people
in
all
truth
rich
contrary
to
his
public
image
as
an
ice
cold
unscrupulous
businessman
be
the
personification
of
understatement
gross
overreaction
our
discussion
of
rich
s
own
case
developed
into
a
conversation
on
the
tendency
of
the
united
state
to
put
its
own
law
above
the
law
of
other
nation
european
have
a
humorous
expression
the
united
state
have
three
main
export
rock
n
roll
blue
jean
and
its
view
of
the
world
the
united
state
want
to
apply
its
own
peculiar
law
to
the
whole
world
rich
claim
i
be
and
be
satisfied
that
switzerland
live
up
to
its
historic
image
and
do
not
allow
itself
to
be
bully
by
a
big
nation
he
add
in
german
die
schweiz
verbeugte

nicht
switzerland
do
not
bow
the
u
s
political
and
legal
system
have
a
long
and
very
well
know
history
of
grossly
overreact
rich
continue
they
often
shoot
with
big
cannon
at
small
bird
well
know
recent
example
include
the
case
against
martha
stewart
or
arthur
andersen
the
latter
of
which
be
one
of
the
five
big
audit
company
before
the
u
s
destroyed
it
it
be
destroyed
because
of
the
action
of
a
handful
of
its
executive
and
all
eighty
five
thousand
innocent
employee
have
to
bear
the
dire
consequence
along
with
the
shareholder
when
i
ask
him
if
he
doubt
the
american
justice
system
rich
answer
i
do
believe
in
the
rule
of
law
unfortunately
like
everything
create
and
apply
by
man
it
be
not
always
perfect
winston
churchill
once
say
you
can
always
count
on
the
american
to
do
the
right
thing
after
they
have
try
everything
else
rich
s
big
mistake
my
big
mistake
rich
repeat
my
question
i
clearly
underestimated
the
zealot
on
the
u
s
side
and
i
chose
the
wrong
lawyer
in
the
past
whenever
i
have
an
issue
with
the
police
i
talk
to
them
and
settle
it
i
even
propose
to
do
the
same
thing
with
the
prosecutor
but
my
lawyer
at
that
time
ed
williams
say
the
bad
you
could
do
be
to
talk
to
them
we
will
confront
them
head
on
that
be
a
huge
mistake
that
greatly
aggravate
the
problem
i
regret
it
rich
suddenly
switch
language
in
order
to
use
a
very
german
word
die
ohnmacht
which
translates
as
powerlessness
or
impotence
i
have
ask
him
what
he
felt
be
the
bad
aspect
of
the
entire
affair
for
a
man
who
have
pull
himself
up
by
his
own
bootstrap
the
fact
that
he
be
powerless
despite
all
of
his
money
his
contact
and
his
iron
will
must
have
be
unbearable
he
like
to
be
in
control
denise
rich
told
me
when
we
spoke
of
the
effect
the
case
have
have
on
the
family
at
that
time
he
be
out
of
control
because
he
couldn
t
do
what
he
want
to
do
he
couldn
t
travel
he
be
depressed
in
my
career
as
an
investigative
journalist
i
have
often
spoken
with
people
who
be
utterly
convince
that
they
have
be
the
victim
of
an
overly
zealous
medium
and
judiciary
each
and
every
one
of
them
be
deeply
affected
by
the
feel
of
helplessness
the
inability
to
make
themselves
heard
and
a
public
perception
of
the
event
that
be
the
complete
opposite
of
their
own
view
rich
be
no
different
i
always
have
a
good
reputation
this
case
unjustifiably
harm
my
reputation
he
say
die
ohnmacht
rich
repeat
before
continue
again
in
english
and
the
feel
of
not
get
a
fair
trial
we
have
the
experience
of
how
the
prosecutor
proceed
in
the
past
how
they
block
all
our
account
and
how
they
block
all
our
relationship
it
be
you
know
a
total
attack
it
have
a
very
negative
effect
our
company
be
collapse
his
trading
empire
would
have
be
much
large
have
it
not
be
for
the
case
he
claim
accord
to
rich
persecution
by
u
s
authority
be
one
of
the
primary
factor
that
force
him
to
sell
his
company
year
later
see
chapter
after
the
indictment
in
september
rich
s
competitor
be
sure
that
his
company
be
dead
in
the
water
the
racketeering
charge
combine
with
the
freeze
of
million
of
dollar
in
asset
would
have
ruin
most
company
but
rich
s
manage
to
carry
on
they
may
have
be
severely
cripple
but
they
have
survive
my
family
my
friend
and
my
business
partner
always
support
me
because
they
knew
well
our
business
partner
knew
us
as
an
honest
reliable
and
competitive
company
so
they
continued
to
do
business
with
us
rich
explains
why
he
didn
t
come
back
there
be
one
decisive
question
that
sandy
weinberg
do
not
hesitate
to
ask
me
if
the
case
be
so
flaw
why
didn
t
he
come
back
and
face
the
charge
on
hearing
the
question
rich
look
at
me
as
if
he
have
trouble
believe
that
i
still
do
not
understand
he
continue
in
a
low
voice
i
saw
no
hope
of
get
a
fair
trial
because
of
the
unstable
and
inflame
environment
my
case
be
very
bad
unjustifiably
so
he
once
more
point
out
his
belief
that
this
be
a
case
in
which
the
prosecution
have
overstep
the
limit
of
acceptable
conduct
the
situation
be
so
negative
i
didn
t
trust
the
situation
it
wasn
t
a
normal
situation
in
this
rich
receives
support
from
unexpected
quarter
the
former
swiss
minister
of
justice
elisabeth
kopp
ikl
be
of
a
similar
opinion
she
be
a
highly
intelligent
reserve
and
serious
woman
who
harbor
great
sympathy
for
the
united

stem
from
the
year
she

rudolph
giuliani

his
own
goal
kopp
ikl
say
i
realize
that
rich
have
no
chance
of
receive
justice
in
the
united
state
he
could
not
be
sure

told
me
everybody
be

longtime
lawyer
robert
fink
confirm
he
make
a
gesture
with
the
flat
of
his
hand
as
if
he
be
run
it
over
a
wooden
slat
it
be
a
train
on
a
track
that
could
not
be
stop
the
atmosphere

very
pollute

so
much
anger

villain
wall
street
financier
michael
steinhardt

me
we
all
get
the
impression
that
if
he
come
back
they
would
lock
him
up
and
throw
away
the
key
nonsense
sandy
weinberg
say
when
i
confront
him
with
this
criticism
rich
would
have
gotten
a
fair
trial
he
create
the
publicity
not
us

however
the

ability

lead
to
the
suspicion
that

the

be
that
howard

be
betrayed

that
enable

to
avoid

in

jean
ziegler
a

un
special

and
member
of
the
swiss
parliament
state
that
rich
enjoy
secret
protection
in
the
swiss
administration
particularly
in
the
federal
department
of
justice
and
police
ken
hill
the
man
who
be
on
rich
s
trail
for
fourteen
year
see
no
more
room
for
doubt
the
former
u
s
marshal
understands
that
rich
be
a
valuable
business
partner
for
a
number
of
country
he
be
much
too
important
for
them
to
forgo
his
service
and
turn
him
over
to
the
american
i
mean
he
be
a
key
element
in
provide
commodity
to
many
nation
in
europe
and
asia
hill
told
me
don
t
forget
there
be
only
a
few
people
that
can
loan
one
billion
dollar
to
each
other
this
be
a
very
exclusive
club
a
very
strong
network
this
privilege
turn
out
to
be
a
safety
net
for
him
he
must
have
get
the
protection
of
intelligence
service
such
statement
help
explain
the
fact
that
the
united
state
do
not
receive
the
cooperation
it
have
hop
for
from
a
number
of
country
the

submit

for

country
all
of
them
member
of

but
none
of
these
request
be
successful
he
be
hard
to
get
because
he
have
a
great
deal
of
influence
in
a

of
country
howard
safir
confirm
crusade
against
me
other
nation
do
not
share
the
u
s
view
and
consequently
refuse
to
be
instrumentalized
for
their
crusade
against
me
rich
say
calmly
when
i
ask
if
he
have
be
tipped
off
and
protect
rich
s
answer
be
as
short
as
it
be
tell
maybe
he
say
smile
before
take
another
sip
of
wine
even
today
hardly
anyone
realizes
that
employee
at
the
u
s
state
department
who
naturally
be
aware
of
the
government
s
international
activity
be
in
direct
personal
contact
with
rich
as
i
will
show
later
even
though
he
be
consider
a
fugitive
and
be
at
the
same
time
be
pursue
by
other
government
agency
in
the
powder
keg
of
the
middle
east
of
particular
strategic
importance
to
the
united
state
rich
be
actually
consider
an
active
diplomatic
asset
the
gumshoe
in
the
field
be
also
aware
of
this
howard
safir
prove
particularly
outspoken
and
blunt
i
have
found
that
the
big
impediment
to
operational
law
enforcement
be
have
to
deal
through
the
bureaucracy
of
the
state
department
he
state
in
his
testimony
before
the
committee
on
government
operation
he
criticize
certain
policy
restraint
and
state
that
in
his
opinion
the
failure
to
apprehend
the
fugitive
be
due
to
the
lack
of
support
at
the
high
level
of
government
i
believe
that
if
a
political
decision
be
make
at
the
high
level
of
this
government
that
we
be
go
to
apprehend
marc

and
pincus

and
use
all
of
the
available
tool
that
we
would
have
marc
rich
and
pincus
green
very
quickly
the
committee
on
government
reform
come
to
the
same
conclusion
the
united

lack
the
political
will
to
effect
the
return
of
these
fugitive
at
the

only
to
be
disappointed
time
and
time
again
he
spent
million
in
lawyer
fee
it
be
not
unusual
for
one
of
his

i

factly
as
if

do
he

much
that
but
i
be
always
interested
to
settle
it
if
possible
rich
answer
i
ask
him
what
the
advantage
of
a
settlement
would
have
be
to
be
completely
free
he

what
i

now
why

two
notoriously
corrupt

told
me
the

be
the
benchmark
not
your

as

you
should
abstract
yourself

you

close

thanks
to
corrupt

bribery
may
have
allow
him
to
trump
his

but
it
be
not
realistic
to
attribute
rich

success
to
such
activity
alone
the
fact
that
rich
be
able
to
dominate
the

for

be
not
the
result
of

the

they
don

the

this
as
his
most
important
skill
the
ability
to
see

his
stroke
of

be
the

that

even

there
have
be

the

yet

also

these

regularly
call
nioc
headquarters
in
tehran
from
brussels
if
iranian
official
have
ever
have
the
opportunity
to
meet
monsieur
ndolo
they
would
have
be
rather
surprised
monsieur
ndolo
do
not
actually
come
from
burundi
nor
be
he
black
he
be
a
white
trader
who
work
for
marc
rich
and
only
pretend
to
be
from
the
african
country
nor
be
cobuco
a
burundian
state
own
company
as
everyone
believe
in
reality
cobuco
be
a
joint
venture
between
rich
s
company
and
the
burundian
government
each
of
which
own
a
percent
stake
the
company
be
found
to
trade
with
postrevolutionary
iran
rich
s
trader
who
would
later
take
on
the
role
of
monsieur
ndolo
contact
the
burundian
government
through
an
intermediary
and
suggest
what
one
might
call
a
very
original
deal
burundi
should
request
a
long
term
contract
for
oil
delivery
from
iran
s
revolutionary
government
monsieur
ndolo
who
today
do
not
wish
to
see
his
real
name
appear
in
print
explain
with
enthusiasm
the
advantage
the
company
have
reaped
from
this
deal
a
burundian
delegation
actually
do
travel
to
tehran
in
order
to
negotiate
an
oil
contract
i
instruct
the
delegation
from
the
background
i
thought
it
would
be
possible
for
a
poor
country
such
as
burundi
to
ask
the
islamic
government
in
iran
for
favorable
term
of
payment
i
told
the
delegation
they
should
offer
to
pay
iran
the
official
opec
price
but
they
would
only
be
able
to
pay
one
year
after
delivery
and
with
no
interest
payment
monsieur
ndolo
knew
that
the
iranian
advanced
an
islamic
economy
base
on
the
rule
set
forth
in
the
koran
which
forbade
the
charge
of
interest
after
a
long
series
of
negotiation
iran
finally
agree
to
the
deal
propose
by
the
burundian
delegation
and
the
two
party
sign
a
long
term
contract
for
the
delivery
of
crude
rich
charter
ship
to
collect
the
oil
from
the
iranian
harbor
of
bandar
abbas
in
the
persian
gulf
nioc
believe
the
ship
would
transport
the
oil
to
a
refinery
in
kenya
there
it
would
be
refine
and
transport
by
tanker
truck
to
inland
burundi
where
it
would
help
to
get
the
burundian
economy
run
and
aid
in
the
development
of
the
country
the
reality
however
be
completely
different
we
make
a
fortune
monsieur
ndolo
told
me
in
his
office
locate
in
a
european
capital
he
lean
back
and
drew
deeply
on
his
cigarette
you
usually
have
to
pay
for
the
oil
within
thirty
day
he
explain
in
this
case
we
have
a
year
before
we
have
to
meet
the
payment
all
without
have
to
pay
interest
for
rich
s
company
it
be
two
good
deal
in
one
it
only
have
to
pay
the
official
opec
price
for
the
oil
a
price
that
be
generally
low
than
the
spot
market
price
and
it
earn
money
on
the
defer
payment
because
its
customer
abide
by
the
usual
payment
term
in
the
early
s
the
prime
rate
be
a
horrendous
percent
it
be
percent
in
february
that
be
percent
that
rich
could
add
to
the
price
as
only
a
small
portion
of
the
oil
actually
make
it
to
burundi
most
of
the
oil
be
sell
by
marc
rich
co
for
good
price
on
the
spot
market
both
party
have
a
good
laugh
at
the
negotiate
table
as
they
close
the
fantastic
deal
just
the
way
rich
like
it
we
want
oil
from
burundi
burundi
want
money
we
both
profit
enormously

one
of

concern
the
marc

manley
admit

they
have

back
on

why
they
ask
themselves
do
manley
make
such
a
stagger
degree
turn
the
simplest
answer
to
this
question
be
give
to
me
by
a
banker
who
work
for

marc
rich

he
have

credit
be
dependent
on
the
result
of
the
inspection
the
ca
rib
be
an

be
as
reliant
on

loan
as
an
addict
be
on
his
drug
of
choice
jamaica
be
deep
in
debt
its
balance
of

be
heavily
in
the
red
and
the
jamaican

be
steadily
lose

in
the
spring
of
it
look
as
if
jamaica
would
flunk
the

test
most

the

the

it

otherwise
the

a

that

in
the
end
even

shortly
after

prime

manley
enter
into
talk
with
clarendon
s
manager
they
explore
the
idea
of
rich
help
jamaica
with
a
loan
and
discover
they
be
preach
to
the
convert
the
imf
forbade
country
from
borrowing
money
to
cover
their
currency
reserve
so
a
normal
loan
be
out
of
the
question
rich
s
people
however
believe
the
problem
could
be
solve
with
a
bit

this

the

and
they
be
content
to
let
him
take
the

heat
today
there
be
absolutely
no

that

be
the
ostracize

most
important

from
to
when

conservative
estimate
these

of
tanker

a
total
of
million
metric
ton
or
around
million
barrel
of
oil
from
information
gather
during
the
extensive
interview
that
i
conduct
for
this
book
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
true
sum
be
actually
more
in
the
region
of
million
barrel
rich
make
a
lot
of
money
in
those
year
believe
me
we
make
huge
business
with
south
africa
huge
business
one
of
rich
s
close
cadre
with
access
to
the
company
s
book
admit
to
me
at
first
he
do
not
wish
to
tell
me
the
exact
sum
so
i
wooed
him
with
number
a
billion
i
ask
him
he
shook
his
head
and
laugh
one
and
a
half
billion
i
ask
without
utter
a
noise
he
mouth
the
word
more
i
shook
my
head
in
disbelief
whereupon
he
nod
and
say
two
billion
dollar
we
make
a
profit
of
over
two
billion
dollar
in
south
africa
two
billion
dollar
be
an
unbelievable
sum
in
those
day
proof
that
this
sum
be
no
mere
overestimation
can
be
found
in
the
debate
that
take
place
before
the
south
african
parliament
in
april
during
these
debate
it
be
discover
that
the
state
strategic
fuel
fund
have
paid
marc
rich
million
above
the
spot
market
price
for
one
large
oil
delivery
alone
i
don
t
know
rich
say
when
i
ask
him
about
the
billion
it
seem
as
if
he
be
try
to
avoid
the
question
i
ask
him
if
he
no
longer
want
to
remember
whereupon
he
finally
answer
that
he
have
never
calculate
how
much
money
he
have
earn
in
south
africa
over
the
course
of
those
fifteen
year
he
do
confirm
however
that
the
trade
with
south
africa
have
be
his
most
important
and
most
profitable
business
there
be
good
reason
for
view
rich
as
something
of
a
karl
marx
figure
who
make
all
of
the
oil
country
aware
of
their
interest
as
rich
s
business
partner
and

isaac
querub
comment
one
can
see
him
as
someone
who
provide
third
world
country
with
their
first
opportunity
to
play
a
role
in
the
global
market
as
the

in

put
it
one
can

as
profit
orient
development
worker
who
give
the
key
of

as
the
expert
on
angola
believe
angola
and
jamaica
be
good
example
of
this
thesis
whereas
apartheid
south
africa
be
the
exact
opposite
angola
and
jamaica
be
able
to
assert
themselves
and
develop
but
the
opposite
be
true
in

fundamentally
against

sell
it
to
them
because
of
the

because
we
felt
it
be
nothing
illegal
many
people

some

would
cite
ethical
reason
for
not

some
of
the

that
you

be
that
naive
i

why
because
it

can
you

no
it

the

he
be
appalled
by
the

allow
the

he
be
disgust
by
the

in
no

benefit
from

although
rich
believe
the

be
fundamentally
wrong
he
also
believe
that

he
do
not

and
his

since
when
i
spoke
to
him
about
his

i
could
sense
the
deep
resentment
he
felt
toward
those
responsible
for
the
witch
hunt
and
the
crusade
against
him
yet
rich
harbor
no
hatred
of
the
country
that
take
him
in
when

continual
support
and
its
agent
be
in
regular
contact
with
the
fugitive
trader
a
fact
that
have
remain
shroud
in
secrecy
to
this
day
they
want
his
opinion
on
various
key
people
in
power
in
some
of
the
politically
sensitive
country
where

especially
sought
detail

he
give
them
what

maintain
contact
in
precisely
the
same
country
in
which
the
united
state
have
hardly
any
contact
left
it
be
indeed
a
remarkable
network
he
knew
iran
africa
and
the
arab
nation
well
than
nearly
any
other
businessman
in
the
western
world
he
have
direct
contact
with
the
inner
political
circle
of
country
such
as
iran
syria
angola
and
cuba
country
that
at
least
officially
want
nothing
to
do
with
the
united
state
and
vice
versa
his
business
dealing
be
proof
of
just
how
good
his
source
truly
be
our
intelligence
gathering
be
the
most
sophisticated
in
the
world
a
longtime
employee
of
rich
s
company
proudly
told
me
sometimes
we
knew
critical
information
before
the
cia
especially
regard
event
in
iran
marc
rich
and
some
of
his
employee
regularly
share
this
knowledge
with
u
s
and
israeli
official
i
have
spoken
with
several
trader
who
be
involve
in
this
exchange
of
information
and
they
have
substantiate
this
version
of
event
they
be
follow
the
trader
s
proven
motto
give
and
you
shall
receive
the
state
department
s
willingness
to
cooperate
with
a
fugitive
suspect
and
his
trader
who
be
at
the
same
time
be
hunt
by
other
governmental
agency
might
be
interpret
as
cynical
and
hypocritical
yet
any
intelligence
service
in
the
world
would
have
be
interested
in
maintain
a
relationship
with
a
man
such
as
marc
rich
a
man
who
have
both
the
contact
and
the
ability
to
bring
such
disparate
partner
together
time
and
time
again
the
true
value
of
such
contact
and
the
trust
information
that
only
they
can
provide
becomes
tragically
clear
when
they
be
no
longer
available
in
its
report
the
commission
create
by
the
u
s
congress
to
investigate
the
september
attack
criticize
what
it
saw
as
a
series
of
intelligence
shortcoming
the
report
explicitly
mention
limited
intelligence
collection
and
strategic
analysis
capability
and
a
limited
capacity
to
share
information
both
internally
and
externally
in
light
of
such
criticism
there
be
only
one
rational
approach
for
the
u
s
government
when
it
come
to
use
a
network
of
informant
like
rich
s
even
though
they
view
him
as
a
fugitive
from
justice
the
word
for
this
approach
be
realpolitik
help
israel
s
mossad
realpolitik
be
one
of
israel
s
great
strength
the
jewish
state
be
completely
surround
by
its
enemy
which
have
impose
a
boycott
on
the
country
none
of
the
arab
state
maintain
official
diplomatic
relation
with
israel
but
there
be
of
course
a
number
of
clandestine
contact
sometimes
quite
close
it
be
the
mossad
s
duty
to
establish
and
maintain
such
contact
for
israel
s
intelligence
service
be
the
very
master
of
realpolitik
have
the
mossad
ignore
rich
and
his
contact
in
iran
syria
and
the
persian
gulf
state
the
agency
would
not
have
be
do
its
job
the
mossad
establish
its
first
contact
with
marc
rich
back
in
the
s
i
m
not
give
any
name
avner
azulay
say
flatly
when
i
ask
him
for
detail
this
would
be
much
too
dangerous
we
have
be
talk
about
rich
for
several
hour
in
a
hotel
in
downtown
lucerne
azulay
explain
to
me
that
the
mossad
be
much
more
than
a
traditional
intelligence
service
it
also
help
jew
who
live
in
country
where
they
be
in
danger
or
even
subject
to
persecution
it
support
jewish
community
in
their
effort
to
organize
and
defend
themselves
from
anti
semitism
we
have
this
duty
of
solidarity
azulay
told
me
we
have
be
persecute
history
have
not
be
very
kind
to
us
we
have
a
duty
to
help
each
other
especially
since
the
holocaust
have
the
state
of
israel
exist
then
perhaps
history
would
have
turn
out
differently
wherever
jew
be
living
under
threat
the
mossad
help
them
to
leave
the
country
by
covert
mean
and
settle
in
israel
or
wherever
they
wish
azulay
explain
how
rich
have
help
the
mossad
with
his
business
contact
as
well
as
with
money
during
such
evacuation
operation
thanks
to
rich
jew
from
ethiopia
yemen
and
israel
s
enemy
could
be
rescue
and
brought
to
israel
in
the
s
and
s
after
azulay
left
the
mossad
in
and
go
to
work
as
a
security
expert
for
marc
rich
his
former
colleague
begin
to
ask
him
if
rich
would
be
willing
to
help
them
in
the
evacuation
of
ethiopian
jew
know
as
the
beta
israel
or
falasha
who
have
be
separate
from
other
jewish
community
for
century
this
be
before
the
famed
operation
moses
that
rescue
ten
of
thousand
of
these
jew
and
flew
them
to
israel
in
many
of
them
have
flee
to
the
north
of
ethiopia
now
eritrea
and
to
neighbor
sudan
in
the
early
s
in
the
wake
of
civil
war
and
catastrophic
famine
the
mossad
believe
it
have
a
duty
to
save
them
the
israeli
government
knew
it
would
have
to
do
the
ethiopian
a
favor
if
they
be
to
consent
to
the
evacuation
yitzhak
rabin

the
israeli
government
do
not

the
money

would
be
willing
to
take
on
the
cost
rich

of
ethiopian
jewish

they
be
thus
able
to
avoid
the

escape
from
yemen
ten
year
after
the

a
big
success
but
in
the
end
it
be
a
very
sad
story
azulay
say
while
regretfully
shake
his

the

have
be
the
begin
of
an
even
large
operation
aim

evacuate
the
entire
endanger
yemeni
jewish

however
the
operation
be
sabotage
by
the
satmar
an
ultra
orthodox
jewish
sect
that
refuse
to
recognize
israel
or
any
form
of
zionism
when
the
satmar
get
wind
of

evacuation
of

yemeni
family
the
sect
threaten
azulay
and
rich
if
you
continue
to
do
this
we
will
make
public
that
there
be
traitor
in
the
yemenite
government
this
put
an
immediate
stop
to
the
operation
year
later
rich
s
involvement
in
the
evacuation
of
yemeni
and
ethiopian
jew
be
finally
confirm
by
high
rank
official
in
a
very
unusual
step
shabtai
shavit
the
head
of
the
mossad
from
to
actively
campaign
for
president
clinton
to
pardon
rich
thus
break
the
mossad
s
code
of
silence
in
a
letter
to
the
president
shavit
explicitly
write

we

in
the
rescue
and
evacuation
of

country
mr
rich
always
agree
and
use
his
extensive
network
of
contact
in
these
country
to
produce
result
sometimes
beyond
the
expect
israel
and
the
jewish
people
be
grateful
for
these
unselfish
action
which
sometimes
have
the
potential
of
jeopardizing
his
own
personal
interest
and
business
relation
in
these
country
shavit
knew
what
he
be
write
about
he
have
be
personally
involve
in
some
of
these
operation
it
s
not
healthy
to
get
into
this
azulay
say
to
me
and
pause
for
a
moment
he
obviously
want
to
avoid
answer
my
question
i
have
ask
him
about
information
that
i
have
receive
state
that
rich
have
help
in
the
search
for

by
shiite
militia
in
lebanon
syria
iraq
and
iran
accord
to
my
source
rich
use
his
contact
in
iran
and
syria
to
this
effect
azulay
would
only
confirm
that
rich
have
provide
him
with
some
contact
with
senior
official
these
senior
official
he
told
me
be
able
to
bring
him
together
with
people
who
knew
more
about
the
fate
of
the
miss
soldier
marc
fund
my
travel
not
the
government
he
explains
it
be
dangerous
for
him
and
dangerous
for
them
azulay
then
say
that
he
would
prefer
not
to
discus
these
operation
every
time
the
press
mention
marc
s
name
in
connection
with
the
mossad
this
make
him
a
target
accord
to
one
article
in
the
british
observer
rich
routinely
allow
agent
to
use
his
office
around
the
world
as
cover
a
claim
azulay
say
be
just
a
rumor
spread
by
the
american
to
under
mine
rich
s
business
informal
mediator
between
israel
and
iran
rich
himself
also
wish
to
avoid
get
into
detail
when
i
ask
him
about
the
assistance
he
provide
the
mossad
when
i
ask
him
why
he
be
eager
to
help
rich
take
a
sip
of
diet
coke
and
hesitates
before
answer
first
of
all
i
m
jewish
second
israel
be
a
country
i
m
involve
with
i
m
a
citizen
it
s
a
natural
thing
for
me
to
help
israel
i
ask
him
if
it
be
dangerous
for
him
to
ask
high
official
in
enemy
country
about
miss
israeli
soldier
rich
again
remains
silent
for
quite
some
time
as
if
consider
what
he
could
safely
tell
me
his
answer
be
not
as
concrete
as
i
have
hop
there
be
not
many
people
that
i
could
talk
to
about
it
but
a
few
people
who
i
felt
i
could
talk
to
i
do
talk
to
how
do
they
react
rich
raise
both
his
hand
shrug
and
say
it
be
no
problem
in
which
country
i
ask
he
shake
his
head
mainly
iran
and
syria
yes
he
say
i
notice
that
this
line
of
question
be
make
rich
increasingly
uneasy
as
a
final
question
i
ask
him
if
he
have
serve
as
an
informal
mediator
between
iran
and
israel
to
some
extent
i
guess
i
be
but
it
wasn
t
a
position
i
be
officially
look
for
i
just
want
to
be
helpful
on
a
case
by
case
basis
one
case
be
about
the
secret
pipeline
the
joint
venture
between
israel
and
iran
see
chapter
after
the
islamic
revolution
in
iran
cut
off
all
contact
with
israel
and
stop
supply
it
with
iranian
oil
six
year
later
the
national
iranian
oil
company
file
lawsuit
against
israel
iran
claimed
about
million
for
unpaid
oil
delivery
negotiation
through
lawyer
reach
a
dead
end
iran
object
to
direct
contact
with
israel
so
marc
rich
met
in
jerusalem
with
prime
minister
yitzhak
rabin
in
and
propose
a
possible
solution
that
his
company
would
buy
israel
s
share
and
negotiate
a
solution
with
iran
in
a
businesslike
way
rabin
agree
avner
azulay
who
be
present
at
this
meeting
told
me
but
the
affair
be
torpedoed
by
the
bureaucrat
who
make
the
condition
so
complicate
that
marc
rich
eventually
lose
interest
i
m
sure
today
they
be
sorry
marc
rich
be
not
a
mossad
agent
as
some
have
occasionally
claimed
he
be
not
a
spy
in
the
true
sense
of
the
word
he
regularly
offer
his
service
as
a
volunteer
and
he
be
of
great
use
to
the
mossad
he
organize
contact
in
place
where
the
mossad
have
none
he
offer
money
in
situation
where
israel
officially
could
not
that
be
why
rich
have
be
personally
acquaint
with
all
israeli
prime
minister
from
menachem
begin
to
ehud
barak
the
mossad
refers
to
people
like
rich
as
sayan
the
hebrew
word
for
helper
it
be
a
fitting
name
for
the
commodity
trader
who
above
all
considers
himself
a
provider
of

promise
her
terminally
ill
daughter
that
she
would
make
sure
her
father
stayed
in
switzerland
he
be
prepared
to
take
any
consequence
danielle
say
with
the
heaviest
of
heart
rich
decide
against
travel
to
the
united
state
he
stayed
in
switzerland
and
miss
his
daughter
s
funeral
rich
s
friend
still
tell
each
other
how
agent
attend
the
funeral
in
the
event
rich
do
decide
to
come
the
u
s
marshal
who
be
tasked
with
apprehend
rich
be
convince
that
he
might
try
to
secretly
travel
to
the
united
state
via
canada
sure
it
s
very
sad
say
sandy
weinberg
the
assistant
u
s
attorney
who
have
initiate
the
investigation
into
rich
he
seem
irritated
that
i
have
ask
him
if
it
would
have
be
a
humanitarian
gesture
to
grant
rich
safe
conduct
it
s
kind
of
hard
to
feel
sorry
for
him
he
create
the
situation
safe
conduct
it
doesn
t
work
like
that
he
chose
not
to
play
by
the
rule
weinberg
explain
he
be
probably
right
those
be
the
rule
any
prosecutor
or
any
politician
who
have
grant
rich
safe
conduct
would
have
face
the
toughest
of
criticism
it
be
probably
naive
for
a
fugitive
to
hope
for
such
mercy
however
i
remember
the
word
of
avner
azulay
no
humane
person
would
have
deny
such
a
request
marc
didn
t
kill
anybody
he
be
not
a
terrorist
i
spoke
about
the
case
with
the
swiss
minister
of
justice
who
be
involve
in
rich
s
case
in
the
mid
s
i
want
to
know
how
she
would
have
react
to
just
such
a
request
elisabeth
kopp
ikl
answer
without
a
moment
s
hesitation
as
minister
of
justice
i
would
have
grant
safe
conduct
in
a
similar
case
otherwise
i
would
not
have
be
able
to
face
myself
in
the
mirror
anymore
i
reply
by
say
that
a
decision
of
that
nature
would
have
put
her
under
immense
political
pressure
she
look
at
me
for
quite
some
time
consider
then
say
there
be
situation
in
which
humanitarian
issue
must
take
precedence
over
political
issue
if
this
be
no
longer
possible
then
you
have
to
ask
yourself
why
you
be
even
involve
in
politics
her
answer
echoed
in
my
head
long
after
our
discussion
have
end
i
be
happy
that
i
be
not
a
politician
daughter
s
grave
move
to
israel
doesn
t
help
me
rich
say
with
a
bitter
tone
when
i
tell
him
how
the
former
minister
of
justice
react
rich
have
also
miss
the
death
and
burial
of
his
father
in
new
york
in
september
david
rich
be
always
his
son
s
great
role
model
both
as
a
father
and
a
businessman
marc
an
only
child
want
nothing
more
than
to
prove
to
his
father
that
he
be
successful
in
business
he
want
his
father
s
recognition
yet
rich
be
unable
to
attend
his
father
s
funeral
and
say
the
kaddish
the
traditional
prayer
of
mourn
that
only
a
son
can
recite
it
be
an
extremely
important
prayer
a
religious
friend
of
the
rich
family
explain
it
be
the
last
service
that
the
son
can
perform
for
the
dead
father
for
marc
it
be
a
tragedy
that
he
be
not
able
to
be
there
rich
have
no
other
option
than
to
recite
the
kaddish
over
the
telephone
as
i
quickly
discover
rich
do
not
like
talk
about
the
death
of
his
father
and
daughter
there
be
however
one
question
that
i
have
to
ask
can
one

be
happy
again

the
pain
still
lingers
after
all
these

when

thing
about

and
i
met
gisela
whom
i
like
could
he
not
accept
the
fact
that
denise
be
often
away
pursue
her
songwriting
career
she
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
her
music
that
s
true
and
she
have
certain
characteristic
which
bother
me
she
be
always
late
always
still
after
two
year
of
struggle
denise
finally
give
up
the
two
legally
separate
and
denise
return
to
the
united
state
she
file
for
a
divorce
in
april
denise
chose
to
have
the
trial
in
switzerland
as
she
knew
that
accord
to
swiss
law
she
might
be
entitle
to
half
of
the
fortune
that
her
husband
have
accumulate
during
their
marriage
she
hire
the
aggressive
lawyer
max
lebedkin
to
represent
her
in
court
lebedkin
be
know
for
do
whatever
be
necessary
to
make
sure
the
wife
of
rich
men
come
away
rich
from
their
divorce
as
be
usually
true
when
he
be
involve
the
rich
divorce
escalate
into
an
all
out
struggle
it
would
be
one
of
the
bitter
most
expensive
and
most
public
divorce
trial
the
world
have
ever
see
lebedkin
sought
a
settlement
of
around
half
a
billion
dollar
the
crafty
lawyer
claimed
that
denise
and
her
parent
have
put
up
a
substantial
amount
of
the
seed
capital
that
rich
have
need
when
he
have
found
his
company
in

have
support
her
husband
for
over
twenty
year
and
have
give
birth
to
his
three
daughter
thus
lebedkin
argue
denise
have
a
right
to
half
of
her
husband
s
fortune
which
amount
to
at
least
billion
accord
to
forbes
rich
be
worth
at
that
time
approximately
million

claim

up
with
a
counteroffer
million
in

on
the
spot
perhaps
rich

he
could
deal
with
the
marriage
as
if
it
be
just
another
trade
marc
be
actually
a
generous
person
but
his
reaction
in
this
case
be
rather
strange
a
friend

an
insult
marc
destroyed
our
family
denise
also

the
counteroffer
as
an
insult
and
she
soon
hit
back
as
hard
as

nearly
twenty

of
the

indication

point
out
his
ability
as
a
brilliant
trader
and
strategist
rich
s
official
statement
claimed
that
strothotte

on
how
the

there
be
nothing
sinister
about
this
strothotte

and
rich
himself
would
have
remain
at
the
head
of
the
company
much
longer
this
surprisingly
unemotional
confession
must
sound
like
sweet
if
somewhat
late
satisfaction
to
the
ear
of
federal
prosecutor
they
be
never
able
to
bring
him
to
court
but
their
tactic
of
take
away
the
water
have
at
least
brought
them
a
certain
degree
of
success
marc
have
no
choice
one
of
rich
s
most
important
manager
add
and
at
the
same
time
he
realize
that
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
even
if
the
separation
which
one
trader
described
to
me
as
a
shotgun
divorce
be
force
the
future
of
his
life
s
work
be
still
dear
to
his
heart
it
be
perhaps
the
only
explanation
for
why
rich
be
so
generous
to
the
same
people
who
held
the
knife
to
his
throat
the
company
s
new
owner
be
allow
to
pay
off
the
price
of
rich
s
majority
stake
over
the
course
of
several
year
it
be
in
effect
an
interest
free
loan
the
defer
payment
allow
them
to
generate
the
necessary
capital
for
the
management
buyout
with
money
earn
during
the
normal
course
of
business
they

not
have
to
borrow
any
money
or

any
of

strict
confidentiality

the
final
sell
price
it
s
time
to
disclose
this
secret
here
rich
could
have
demand
much
more
for
his
stake
in
marc
rich
co
in
the
end
he
settle
for
the
book

and
set
the

at
million
marc
sell
cheap
one
of
the

told
me
he
have

though
first
rich
didn
t
want
the
management
to
quickly
sell
on
the
share
at
a
high
price
to
a
third
party
he
could
have
do
that
himself
second
a
so
call

into

should
a
subsequent
revaluation
of
the

show
that
they
be
worth
more
than
agree
in
the
contract
rich
would
get
additional
compensation
marc
rich
found
out
a
bit
later
that
the
new
owner
have
secretly
sell
around
percent
of
the

furthermore
the

this
sum
on
monday

so
many
negative
association
vanished
from

one
of

s
close
friend

of
his
restlessness
it

not
about

people
like
marc

don
t
want
to
earn
money
just
to
become
even
richer
they
do
it
out
of
passion
there
be
something
about
the
feel
of
success
that
be
highly
addictive
success
be
measure
fairly
easily
in
his
business
it
be
measure
by
the
amount
of
money
he
make
rich
s
friend
the
hedge
fund
pioneer
michael
steinhardt
told
me
these

remind
me
of
george
mallory
the
english
mountain
climber
who
die
while
attempt
to
be
the
first
person
to
climb
mount
everest
he
be
immortalize
for
the
answer
he
give
when
ask
about
his
insatiable
desire
to
climb
the
world
s
high
mountain
because
it
be
there
when
i
ask
rich
why
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
stop
trading
he
answer
i
love
business
every
dollar
i
make
be
like
the
very
first
there
be
however
another
reason
for
his
obsession
marc
be
afraid
he
could
lose
his
entire
fortune
and
die
poor
a
friend
confide
in
me
it
be
a
statement
that
might
seem
absurd
at
first
rich
have
more
money
than
he
could
ever
spend
even
in
the
course
of
several
lifetime
he
own
real
estate
and
work
of
art
that
regardless
of
whatever
happens
on
the
stock
exchange
be
worth
ten
if
not
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
rich
s
fear
of
poverty
be
completely
illusory
yet
it
be
a
fear
that
rich
share
with
many
refugee
who
have
experienced
what
it
be
like
to
lose
everything
it
be
also
a
typically
jewish
fear
one
the
entire
rich
family
be
well
aware
of
as

clear
to
us
that
we
be
lucky
for
what
we
have
and
that
we
must
not
take
it
for
grant
because
we
could
not
depend
on
it
always
be
there
it
could
be
lose
or
take
away
just

exactly
this

found
three

culture
when
you
be
do
well
do
charity
one
of
rich
s
employee
told
me
naturally
there
be
a
charity
piggy
bank
in
the
company
at
the
end
of
the
year
we
could
write
on
a
piece
of
paper
how
much
we
want
to
donate
to
a
particular
organization
and
the
company
would
double
the
sum
it
be
marc
s
idea
another
of
rich
s
employee
remembers
how
he
once
sat
down
together
with
rich
after
receive
a
promotion
after
a
while
marc
suddenly
stuck
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
come
out
with
a
roll
of
dollar
you
will
soon
be
earn
a
lot
of
money
he
told
me
and
put
the
roll
in
my
hand
start
by
give
this
money
to
the
first
poor
man
on
the
street
wealth
always
mean
independence
and
comfort
of
course
rich
answer
when
i
want
to
know
what
his
fortune
meant
to
him
but
it
also
mean
that
i
can
help
the
less
fortunate
through
my
foundation
it
s
move
and
utterly
satisfy
to
see
the
effect
of
a
school
or
hospital
in
a
deprive
area
or
to
help
along
young
gift
artist
especially
in
the
field
of
music
what
be
he
most
proud
of
when
it
come
to
his
philanthropy
the
money
have
an
effect
and
be
not
waste
rich
s
extraordinary
charity
be
one
of
the
argument
that
be
use
in
his
pardon
application
his
critic
maintain
that
rich
become
involve
in
philanthropy
only
in
order
to
help
save
his
reputation
even
the
good
thing
marc
do
be
use
against
him
that
really
hurt
avner
azulay
told
me
he
then
mention
that
rich
s
first
foundation
be
active
as
early
as
long
before
the
indictment
we
couldn
t
know
then
azulay
say
sarcastically
that
decade
later
a
president
bill
clinton
would
pardon
him
the
pardon
o
n
friday
january
jack
quinn
be
at
a
dinner
party
in
washington
d
c
when
his
mobile
phone
rang
it
be
only
shortly
past
nine
but
when
quinn
look
at
the
display
to
see
who
be
call
he
knew
the
party
be
over
for
him
it
be
potus
the
president
of
the
united
state
it
be
bill
clinton
s
last
night
in
the
white
house
and
the
president
want
to
speak
with
quinn
about
the
pardon
application
that
quinn
have
submit
a
month
ago
for
his
client
marc
rich
and
pincus
green
the
president
have
obviously
read
and
study
the
petition
quinn
told
me
he
excuse
himself
from
the
dinner
table
and
make
his
way
to
an
empty
room
he
and
the
president
knew
each
other
well
as
quinn
have
serve
as
clinton
s
white
house
counsel
the
conversation
last
around
twenty
minute
it
be
a
good
thorough
discussion
that
be
entirely
about
the
merit
of
the
pardon
not
about
the
politics
quinn
remembers
as
he
listen
to
the
president
speak
the
word
seem
to
course
through
him
like
a
jolt
of
electricity
i
persuade
the
president
he
thought
i
persuade
the
president
that
this
be
a
case
that
should
have
be
handle
civilly
rather
than
criminally
on
that
even
it
be
clear
that
clinton
be
seriously
consider
pardon
rich
and
green
however
the
president
have
one
precondition
and
that
be
why
he
have
call
quinn
rich
and
green
would
have
to
agree
to
face
a
civil
hearing
and
waive
their
right
to
avail
themselves
of
the
statute
of
limitation
quinn
immediately
accepted
the
president
s
term
clinton
want
to
have
a
write
waiver
within
one
hour
quinn
look
at
his
watch
it
be
p
m
he
immediately
call
robert
fink
rich
s
lawyer
in
new
york
explain
the
situation
and
ask
him
to
write
up
a
waiver
for
rich
and
green
in
accordance
with
the
president
s
request
fink
be
surprised
he

have
write
absense
instead

mood

from
michael

a

for

hi
sandy
what
do

think
of
the

i
uttered
a
vulgarity
weinberg
tell
me
this
be
outrageous
i
thought
this
be
just
outrageous
in
a
staccato
voice
one
two
three
four
he
proceeds
to
list
the
four
point
that
from
his
point
of
view
make
it
impossible
for
the
president
to
pardon
rich
one
it
be
the
big
tax
fraud
two
he
be
a
fugitive
three
he
renounce
citizenship
in
order
to
avoid
extradition
four
he
trade
with
the
enemy
iran
you
cannot
pardon
a
person
like
that
weinberg
say
news
of
rich
s
pardon
spread
among
politician
journalist
and
judicial
official
their
reaction
be
unanimously
negative
rich
s
case
have
once
more
take
on
historic
proportion
accord
to
an
article
in
the
conservative
national
review
the
pardon
be
one
of
the
most
disgraceful
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
justice
department
not
the
modern
history
the
entire
history
for
william
safire
a
pulitzer
prize
win
columnist
for
the
new
york
time
the
pardon
be
the
most
flagrant
abuse
of
the
presidential
pardon
in
u
s
history
vanity
fair
even
venture
to
suggest
that
the
pardon
may
have
damage
president
clinton
s
reputation
forever
those
who
be
involve
in
rich
s
case
be
particularly
disgruntle
with
the
pardon
rudy
giuliani
be
flabbergast
it
take
me
about
a
day
to
actually
absorb
the
fact
that
the
president
of
the
united
state
actually
pardon
one
of
our
most
notorious
fugitive
he
say
howard
safir
say
he
be
outrage
because
this
sends
a
message
to
the
criminal
around
the
world
that
if
you
have
influence
if
you
have
money
and
if
you
have
access
you
can
put
out
a
sign
that
say
justice
for
sale
organize
a
pardon
safir
be
right
on
one
point
access
to
the
president
be
a
decisive
factor
in
rich
s
pardon
it
be
not
only
about
get
the
president
s
ear
but
also
about
explain
rich
s
side
of
the
story
the
idea
of
seek
a
presidential
pardon
first
come
up
in
early
after
u
s
attorney
mary
jo
white
have
again
inform
rich
s
lawyer
that
it
be
the
firm
policy
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
not
to
negotiate
disposition
of
criminal
charge
with
fugitive
see
chapter
quinn
told
me
that
at
that
time
he
almost
take
the
refusal
as
an
affront
it
be
like
you
know
drop
dead
all
attempt
to
have
the
case
legally
reassess
be
thus
doom
to
failure
why
not
try
a
pardon
at
the
end
of
the
clinton
term
michael
steinhardt
first
come
up
with
the
idea
avner
azulay
like
it
what
be
the
chance
he
ask
rich
s
lawyer
azulay
remembers
how
they
all
just
shook
their
head
five
percent
they
say
he
then
ask
do
we
have
a
five
percent
chance
with
another
solution
the
lawyer
be
silent
then
let
s
go
with
the
five
percent
azulay
say
rich
agree
and
give
his
permission
to
seek
a
pardon
i
kept
look
for
solution
i
kept
try
and
nothing
succeed
so
the
pardon
seem
to
be
a
solution
rich
told
me
accord
to
azulay
one
of
rich
s
most
trust
employee
the
system
be
block
the
best
lawyer
create
the
big
mess
they
just
create
more
aversion
eventually
the
thing
developed
into
a
legal
monster
it
become
a
political
case
azulay
explain
there
be
no
legal
solution
that
s
why
it
need
a
political
solution
an
unconventional
one
the
israeli
avner

and
the
american
jack
quinn
be
the
mastermind
behind
the
application
for
a
presidential
pardon
they
quickly
put
together
a
two
pronged
strategy
that
at
least
internally
be
described
as
an
avenue
of
last
resort
one
aspect
be
base
on
the
fact
the
second
be
personal
in
nature
quinn
would
take
care
of
the
legal
issue
write
the
petition
and
present
it
to
the
president
azulay
would
be
responsible
for
the
personal
networking

would
try
to
find
as
many
dignitary
as
possible
who
be
willing
to
put
in
a
good
word
for
rich
and
green
it
be
no
stretch
to
say

would
never
have
pardon
rich
quinn

more

anyone

he
have
a
direct

write
to
the
president
i
support
this
application
with
all
my
heart
her
letter
which
jack
quinn
help
write
be
a
masterpiece
it
appeal
to
the
president
s
emotion
while
refer
to
clinton
s
own
bad
experience
with
aggressive
prosecutor
the
pain
and
suffer
cause
by
that
unjust
indictment
batter
more
than
my
husband
it
struck
his
daughter
and
me
we
have
live
with
it
for
so
many
year
we
live
with
it
now
there
be
no
reason
why
it
should
have
go
on
so
long
exile
for
seventeen
year
be
enough
so
much
of
what
have
be
say
about
marc
as
a
result
of
the
indictment
and
exile
be
just
plain
wrong
yet
it
have
continued
to
damage
marc
and
his
family
because
of
the
indictment
i
have
see
what
happens
when
charge
be
falsely
even
if
just
incorrectly
make
against
those
closest
to
you
and
what
it
feel
like
to
see
the
press
try
and
convict
the
accuse
without
regard
for
the
truth
i
know
the
immense
frustration
that
come
when
the
prosecutor
will
not
discus
their
charge
and
when
no
one
will
look
at
the
fact
in
a
fair
way
my
husband
and
i
could
not
return
to
the
united
sates
sic
because
while
the
charge
be
untrue
no
one
would
listen
all
the
prosecutor
appear
to
think
about
be
the
prospect
of
imprison
marc
for
the
rest
of
his
life
with
a
life
sentence
at
stake
and
press
and
medium
fuel
by
the
us
attorney
we
felt
he
have
no
choice
but
to
remain
out
of
the
country
one
week
after
president
clinton
receive
the
petition
for
rich
s
pardon
denise
also
spoke
directly
to
the
president
about
the
issue
on
december
she
be
a
guest
at
a
dinner
in
washington
to
honor
the
winner
of
the
national
medal
of
art
and
the
national
humanity
medal
during
a
quiet
moment
denise
pull
the
president
to
one
side
and
told
him
that
the
pardon
would
mean
a
lot
to
me
it
be
rather
surprising
that
denise
should
make
such
an
effort
to
stand
up
for
her
ex
husband
her
relationship
to
marc
rich
be
virtually
nonexistent
at
that
point
the
two
have
not
spoken
let
alone
see
one
another
for
year
after
their
bitter
and
nasty
divorce
denise
not
only
resent
the
fact
that
he
have
left
her
for
a
young
woman
she
also
felt
that
rich
have
wrong
her
financially
she
still
believe
that
he
have
cheat
her
by
not
match
the
million
that
she
have
contribute
to
the
charitable
foundation
they
have
found
together
in
even
though
her
claim
be
reject
by
a
swiss
court
see
chapter
she
be
so
angry
with
her
ex
husband
that
she
even
make
a
financial
contribution
of
to
the
campaign
of
rich
s
nemesis
rudolph
w
giuliani
it
have
be
avner
azulay
s
idea
to
include
denise
rich
in
operation
avenue
of
last
resort
he
visit
her
in
november
and
ask
for
her
support
he
screw
me
he
owes
me
money
denise
reply
i
want
the
money
he
owes
me
for
the
foundation
million
azulay
be
shock
he
knew
that
marc
and
denise
do
not
get
along
but
he
have
not
expect
such
deep
resentment
azulay
told
denise
that
it
would
look
very
strange
if
she
the
mother
of
rich
s
child
do
not
stand
up
for
her
ex
husband
he
promise
her
if
you
help
us
now
i
will
talk
to
marc
only
after
a
number
of
meeting
and
many
long
discussion
do
denise
finally
agree
to
use
her
influence
with
the
president
to
help
her
ex
husband
what
motivate
denise
to
throw
her
weight
behind
her
ex
husband
s
petition
i
ask
her
this
question
during
our
conversation
in
her
manhattan
penthouse
i
be
sit
next
to
her
on
a
leather
sofa
take
note
and
be
have
trouble
keep
up
with
what
she
be
say
i
could
record
our
conversation
if
i
like
denise
say
i
have
nothing
to
hide
danielle
laugh
and
say
that
s
my
mother
everybody
else
be
worried
about
themselves
and
she
be
worried
about
you
denise
go
on
to
explain
that
she
have
be
willing
to
help
because
my
child
ask
me
to
support
the
pardon
they
re
my
child
how
could
i
not
yes
but
you
have
be
so
angry
with
him
i
remark
you
have
publicly
accuse
him
of
destroy
your
family
denise
thought
about
this
for
a
moment
before
say
every
divorce
be
bitter
he
s
still
the
father
of
my
child
she
then
told
me
how
gabrielle
s
death
have
change
her
feeling
about
marc
rich
gabrielle
would
have
want
that
i
forgive
him
she
would
have
want
that
i
support
him
a
delicate
financial
agreement
however
it
be
also
true
that
denise
accepted
avner
azulay
s
proposal
to
compensate
her
for
the
million
she
thought
marc
rich
owe
her
accord
to
an
agreement
sign
in
january
by
all
party
shortly
before
president
clinton
finally
grant
the
pardon
rich
and
green
would
each
contribute
per
year
to
the
g
p
foundation
in
order
to
prevent
any
possible
misunderstanding
let
me
emphasize
that
denise
rich
herself
be
not
the
beneficiary
but
rather
the
g
p
foundation
be
the
foundation
would
use
these
fund
to
cooperate
with
the
gabrielle
rich
leukemia
research
centre
at
the
weizmann
institute
of
science
which
marc
rich
have
establish
separately
in
israel
to
support
leukemia
research
it
be
up
to
a
committee
of
scientist

by
both
side
to
decide
how
the
money
could
best
be
invest
denise
acknowledge
the
existence
of
this
agreement
gabrielle
ask
that
we
continue
her
foundation
it
be
my
daughter
s
last
wish
she
have
start
it
and
she
ask
for
it
she
be
work
on
her
computer
up
until
she
die
i
have
ask
marc
rich
and
pincus
green
if
they
would
help
me
and
they
have
say
they
would
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
pardon
in
the
wake
of
the
public
outrage
that
be
spark
by
rich
s
pardon
denise
decide
to
waive
her
right
to
her
ex
husband
s
money
i
didn
t
want
anything
to
hurt
the
foundation
so
i
decide
to
accept
no
money
from
them
i
didn
t
want
the
question
of
money
to
tarnish
the
foundation
she
want
it
to
be
pure
danielle
add
it
be
certainly
the
right
decision
as
the
outrage
that
follow
in
the
wake
of
the
pardon
be
tremendous
to
this
day
denise
rich
still
find
herself
caught
up
in
the
critic
crossfire
the
whole
affair
take
on
the
stench
of
corruption
as
a
result
of
denise
s
contribution
to
the
clinton
and
various
other
democratic
campaign
denise
have
to
deny
even
more
insidious
charge
on
barbara
walter
s
abc
newsmagazine
i
never
have
a
sexual
relationship
or
anything
else
that
s
improper
denise
explain
in
her
interview
with
walter
there
be
hardly
a
single
journalist
or
politician
who
be
prepared
to
believe
that
rich
s
pardon
be
completely
aboveboard
eight
year
later
sandy
weinberg
s
blood
pressure
still
rise
whenever
he
look
back
on
the
affair
they
be
circumvent
the
entire
process
nobody
ask
me
about
it
nobody
ask
the
southern
district
about
it
not
one
person
that
have
any
knowledge
about
the
case
weigh
in
with
the
president
it
s
a
complete
outrage
i
ask
weinberg
if
he
believe
corruption
have
played
a
role
in
the
pardon
i
don
t
want
to
speculate
weinberg
told
me
i
don
t
know
whether
there
be
money
involve
whether
some
corrupt
purpose
be
involve
what
i
do
know
be
that
president
clinton
be
sell
a
bill
of
good
by
jack
quinn
quinn
be
take
aback
by
the
outrage
he
face
i
consider
myself
astute
politically
and
i
certainly
consider
president
clinton
to
be
astute
politically
but
i
think
we
be
both
surprised
at
the
extent
of
the
uproar
that
ensue
i
felt
that
the
entire
affair
have
make
a
much
deeper
impact
on
quinn
than
he
be
prepared
to
admit
in
public
and
i
question
him
on
this
point
during
our
interview
it
be
among
the
most
painful
part
of
my
entire
life
quinn
confide
to
me
when
i
ask
him
what
have
bother
him
most
about
the
reaction
to
rich
s
pardon
quinn
answer
have
my
integrity
question
the
role
of
eric
holder
it
be
not
only
bill
clinton
jack
quinn
and
denise
rich
who
have
to
face
public
outrage
over
rich
s
pardon
eric
holder
soon
found
himself
in
the
fire
line
as
well
holder
serve
at
the
department
of
justice
as
deputy
attorney
general
at
the
time
of
rich
s
pardon
he
be
consider
a
brilliant
independent
and
thoughtful
attorney
who
enjoy
a
great
amount
of
respect
from
both
democrat
and
republican
quinn
have
met
holder
while
serve
in
the
clinton
administration
and
the
two
have
be
in
contact
ever
since
holder
be
one
of
the
first
people
quinn
have
approach
regard
the
rich
affair
in
november
long
before
michael
steinhardt

up
with
the
idea
of

for

to

s
memo
holder
believe
that
the
federal
prosecutor
s
refusal
to
meet
with

s
lawyer

ridiculous
shortly
after
their
discussion

a
memorandum

his
position
holder
reply
that
we
re
all
sympathetic
and
that
the
equity
be
on
your
side
however

it
clear
that
he
could
not
force
the
southern
district
of
new
york
to
meet
with
rich
s
attorney
when

no

president
clinton
s
motivation
clinton
sought
to
explain
his
decision
to
pardon
rich
in
an
extensive
op
ed
article
publish
in
the
new
york
time
in
which
he
include
many
of
the
legal
argument
that
rich
s
legal
team
have
sought
to
employ
over
the
year
see
chapter
and
clinton
interpret
three
of
the
most
important
argument
as
follow
i
understood
that
the
other
oil
company
that
have
structure
transaction
like
those
on
which
mr
rich
and
mr
green
be
indict
be
instead
sue
civilly
by
the
government
two
highly
regard
tax
expert
bernard
wolfman
of
harvard
law
school
and
martin
ginsburg
of
georgetown
university
law
center
review
the
transaction
in
question
and
conclude
that
the
company
be
correct
in
their
u
s
income
tax
treatment
of
all
the
item
in
question
and
that
there
be
no
unreported
federal
income
or
additional
tax
liability
attributable
to
any
of
the
challenged
transaction
the
justice
department
in
reject
the
use
of
racketeering
statute
in
tax
case
like
this
one
these
argument
may
have
be
a
good
way
of
legally
justify
the
pardon
but
i
be
not
sure
they
be
sufficient
to
explain
clinton
s
decision
to
actually
grant
the
pardon
the
research
and
interview
i
carry
out
in
the
course
of
write
this
book
have
lead
me
to
believe
that
denise
rich
s
role
in
the
pardon
have
be
grossly
overestimate
of
course
denise
be
helpful
after
all
she
be
a
friend
and
admirer
of
the
clinton
she
be
able
to
get
the
president
s
attention
something
that
be
always
in
short
supply
and
thus
open
a
few
door
for
her
ex
husband
denise
be
not
the
decide
factor
though
and
her
hefty
donation
to
the
clinton
and
the
democratic
party
be
not
the
reason
rich
be
pardon
neither
be
clinton
s
decision
to
pardon
rich
primarily
a
result
of
legal
argument
instead
the
president
be
swayed
by
the
emotional
and
political
aspect
of
rich
s
petition
on
an
emotional
level
clinton
allow
himself
to
be
convince
by
jack
quinn
s
argument
that
rich
s
case
have
be
grossly
overprosecuted
by
aggressive
federal
prosecutor
the
president
have
himself
experienced
the
length
to
which
fanatical
investigator
be
prepared
to
go
independent
counsel
kenneth
starr
be
originally
appoint
to
investigate
the
clinton
role
in
the
whitewater
scandal
but
starr
later
widen
his
investigation
and
delve
into
the
president
s
affair
with
monica
lewinsky
the
president
soon
found
himself
face
impeachment
proceeding
as
a
result
of
the
investigation
although
he
remain
in
office
his
reputation
have
suffer
greatly
in
the
aftermath
the
president
felt
that
he
have
be
the
victim
of
aggressive
overzealous
persecution
and
rich
s
team
have
consciously
use
the
president
s
feel
of
victimization
in
their
petition
the
pardon
petition
be
literally
write
to
the
president
bob
fink
told
me
before
pop
open
a
can
of
diet
dr
pepper
it
be
write
to
him
with
the
hope
that
he
would
personally
read
it
and
with
the
hope
that
he
would
recognize
his
own
personal
experience
when
it
come
to
the
political
aspect
of
the
petition
the
support
of
ehud
barak
and
shimon
peres
played
a
crucial
role
in
the
president
s
decision
a
belief
that
be
share
by
jack
quinn
and
avner
azulay
the
two
mastermind
behind
rich
s
pardon
application
without
the
support
of
barak
and
peres
clinton
would
not
have
grant
the
pardon
no
doubt
about
it
azulay
told
me
the
entreaty
of
prime
minister
barak
weigh
very
heavily
on
the
president
s
mind
quinn
explain
clinton
seem
to
confirm
their
opinion
in
his
autobiography
ehud
barak
ask
me
three
time
to
pardon
rich
because
of
rich
s
service
to
israel
and
his
help
with
the
palestinian
and
several
other
israeli
figure
in
both
major
party
urge
his
release
marc
rich
be
indeed
of
great
importance
to
the
israeli
rich
s
oil
delivery
and
assistance
to
the
mossad
have
contribute
greatly
to
israel
s
national
security
it
be
difficult
to
imagine
a
u
s
president
who
would
have
not
have
have
difficulty
ignore
the
plea
of
so
many
israeli
politician
and
dignitary
israel
be
by
far
the
closest
ally
of
the
united
state
in
the
middle
east
there
be
a
far
factor
that
could
have
influence
clinton
s
decision
as
well
on
the
day
he
issue
the
pardon
the
israeli
and
the
palestinian
sat
down
for
important
peace
talk
in
the
egyptian
town
of
taba
clinton
have
lent
his
backing
to
the
negotiation
a
month
prior
to
this
taba
summit
israel
s
foreign
minister
shlomo
ben
ami
who
have
also
lobby
for
rich
s
pardon
take
part
in
the
negotiation
the
talk
be
clinton
s
last
opportunity
as
an
american
president
to
help
end
the
israeli
palestinian
conflict
he
almost
get
his
wish
as
both
side
be
willing
to
make
great
compromise
in
the
pursuit
of
peace
never
before
have
the
two
side
come
closer
to
a
comprehensive
peace
treaty
and
they
have
never
come
as
close
since
rationally
right
v
morally
bad
hardly
any
of
clinton
s
other
decision
in
office
be
met
with
the
same
amount
of
extensive
and
prolong
criticism
as
his
pardon
of
marc
rich
the
decision
raise
hackle
in
nearly
all
corner
of
the
nation
and
the
noise
surround
holder
s
confirmation
as
attorney
general
be
proof
that
the
controversy
have
not
subside
yet
hardly
any
politician
or
journalist
seem
willing
to
seriously
and
impartially
address
the
reason
for
the
pardon
publish
reaction
to
the
pardon
remind
me
of
the
old
say
that
journalist
be
like
bird
on
a
wire
if
one
fly
away
they
all
fly
away
the
opinion
be
form
long
ago
marc
rich
be
a
villain
and
because
he
be
a
villain
he
should
not
have
be
pardon
see
from
this
perspective
it
might
just
be
true
that
only
angel
have
a
shot
at
grace
in
the
eye
of
the
public
rich
s
pardon
be
never
really
see
as
rationally
wrong
it
be
just
morally
bad
this
type
of
criticism
quickly
get
bogged
down
at
a
moral
level
that
do
not
allow
for
any
form
of
counterargument
in
retrospect
it
be
not
only
true
that
president
clinton
enjoy
the
unlimited
and
absolute
power
of
pardon
that
be
guaranteed
by
the
u
s
constitution
it
be
also
important
to
take
clinton
s
word
at
their
face
value
despite
all
of
the
attack
on
his
reputation
i
may
have
make
a
mistake
at
least
in
the
way
i
allow
the
case
to
come
to
my
attention
but
i
make
the
decision
base
on
the
merit
as
i
have
illustrate
in
this
chapter
clinton
have
very
good
reason
both
political
and
juridical
for
pardon
marc

on
march
six

after

by

marc

what
babe

no
one

that

be
therefore
rather
surprised
when
rich
signal
via
his
lawyer
that
he
be
prepared
to
pay
part
of
the

its
willingness

negotiate
under
the
condition
that
the
talk
should
remain
a
secret
to
outsider
the
affair
seem
to
take
a
rather
strange
turn
the
tax
authority
who
be
usually
quite
eager
to
comment
on
the
most
trivial
of
development
concern

s
case
suddenly
insist
on
discretion

they
have

embarrass
by
the
fact
that
they

with
the
big

in
the

they
afraid
of
the
public

that
might
ensue

their
pragmatic
stance
be
to
become
widely

be
able
to
reach
a
good
deal
with

to
me
that
in
november
rich
transfer
approximately

wish
to
officially
comment
on
this

one
of
rich

lawyer
say
it
would
not
be
in
mr

to
violate
an
agreement
of
confidentiality
he
make
with
a
government
in
the
united

naturally
i
wish
to
discus
the
matter
with
rich
i
paid
even
though
the
charge
be
completely
unjustified
rich
say
he
confirm
the
agreement
with
the
new

tax
authority
but
do
not
wish
to
name
the
exact
sum
i
m
respect
the
confidentiality
he
explain
i
ask
him
why
he
have
paid
anything
at
all
since
he
be
of
the
opinion
that
he
do
not
owe
the
state
of
new
york
any
money
whatsoever
to
get
rid
of
it
he
reply
it
be
the
only
way
to
get
rid
of
it
i
ll
never
go
back
to
the
usa
in
the
aftermath
of
the
affair
rich
be
able
to
see
which
way
the
wind
be
blowing
and
it
be
a
very
cold
wind
indeed
the
pardon
be
like
a
boomerang
he
have
hop
to
be
able
to
liberate
himself
from
many
of
the
false
accusation
he
have
hop
he
would
be
give
the
freedom
to
return
unmolested
to
the
united
state
he
have
hop
his
name
would
finally
disappear
from
the
headline
the
reality
be
the
exact
opposite
of
what
he
have
hop
for
the
report
be
even
more
scathing
than
they
have
be
before
the
pardon
the
medium
and
the
politician
rehash
all
of
the
same
fact
rumor
and
defamation
rich
who
have
be
left
in
relative
peace
in
the
year
run
up
to
the
pardon
be
again
described
as
the
fugitive
billionaire
the
most
want
white
collar
criminal
in
u
s
history
the
unscrupulous
trader
who
trade
with
the
enemy
in
addition
to
all
of
these
accusation
rich
be
now
see
as
the
man
who
be
even
capable
of
manipulate
the
most
powerful
man
in
the
world
the
president
of
the
united
state
i
regret
very
much
that
bill
clinton
get
in
the
line
of
fire
for
what
he
thought
be
the
right
thing
to
do
rich
tell
me
in
his
office
more
so
because
i
believe
independently
of
the
pardon
that
he
be
one
of
the
best
president
the
u
s
have
have
in
recent
history
smart
able
eloquent
and
positive
he
think
there
be
a
target
campaign
the
reaction
be
completely
unjustified
almost
all
of
the
negative
reaction
come
from
interested
party
who
felt
that
scandalize
clinton
s
decision
would
help
their
own
usually
partisan
agenda
up
to
today
the
main
allegation
be
that
you
essentially
bought
the
pardon
i
say
i
didn
t
he
answer
do
you
give
money
to
your
ex
wife
denise
in
exchange
for
her
help
no
he
say
i
would
never
give
money
to
my
ex
wife
at
first
rich
thought
that
the
pardon
give
me
back
the
freedom
to
travel
wherever
i
want
he
have
ask
for
a
pardon
accord
to
avner
azulay
mainly
so
he
could
visit
his
daughter
s
grave
he
could
visit
his
father
s
grave
he
could
visit
his
family
in
new
york
after
the
public
outcry
in
the
wake
of
the
pardon
though
rich
decide
to
forgo
travel
to
the
united
state
the
american
law
system
be
peculiar
in
this
respect
it
be
not
possible
to
get
confirmation
that
all
legal
proceeding
be
finish
he
say
they
might
still
have
an
unpaid
parking
ticket
of
mine
from
thirty
year
ago
and
might
make
a
big
case
out
of
it
i
ask
him
if
he
intend
to
return
to
the
united
state
someday
never
he
say
firmly
they
would
look
for
some
excuse
to
apprehend
me
i
don
t
want
to
be
expose
to
that
marc
rich
have
hop
the
pardon
would
allow
him
to
regain
his
reputation
now
he
have
again
lose
control
over
his
own
name
once
and
for
all
the
future
accord

you
become
the
most
powerful
commodity
trader
because
you
have
a
knack
for

and
for
seize

where
would
you
go
today
in
what
commodity
would
you
invest
all
commodity
will
be
good
business
the
world
will
produce
more
product
for
more
people
and
will
thus
need
more
raw
material
which
will
be
in
your
opinion
the
most
sought
after
commodity
in
the
twenty
first
century
energy
and
water
will
probably
become
very
important
how
do
you
see
the
future
of
oil
oil
will
play
an
important
role
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
there
be
no
deny
that
it
be
a
finite
commodity
where
do
you
see
the
oil
price
go
up
and
down
but
up
in
the
long
term
without
any
doubt
do
you
see
a
business
opportunity
in
renewable
energy
as
much
as
i
like
oil
it
s
obvious
that
oil
have
to
be
replace
in
the
future
without
doubt
renewable
energy
will
play
an
important
role
in
this
process
as
it
will
become
more
expensive
to
get
the
remain
oil
out
of
the
ground
its
price
will
inevitably
go
up
high
oil
price
will
motivate
innovation
in
the
renewable
energy
sector
and
high
price
will
motivate
people
to
switch
where
would
you
invest
i
would
invest
in
wind
energy
but
also
in
nuclear
energy
global
warm
and
the
reduction
of
carbon
dioxide
emission
will
be
important
issue
in
the
future
you
know
the
intricacy
of
the
middle
east
well
than
most
other
western
businessman
what
be
your
opinion
of
the
iraq
war
the
iraq
war
be
a
mistake
it
s
mind
boggling
that
a
handful
of
politician
can
lead
a
nation
into
full
war
for
such
skimpy
reason
obviously
saddam
hussein
be
a
bad
guy
but
there
be
plenty
of
bad
guy
in
this
world
and
the
united
state
hasn
t
bother
to
remove
them
it
would
seem
that
george
w
bush
be
driven
by
personal
reason
which
make
the
whole
story
bad
of
course
what
personal
reason
do
you
think
of
saddam
hussein
provoke
bush
bush
rise
to
the
bait
it
be
such
a
foolish
thing
to
do
he
didn
t
control
his
emotion
terrible
terrible
for
a
president
be
it
a
war
for
oil
i
don
t
think
so
you
could
have
have
the
iraqi
oil
cheaper
simply
by
lift
the
embargo
but
the
oil
argument
probably
help
to
convince
some
of
the
decision
maker
do
you
think
the
oil
industry
have
an
influence
on
the
decision
to
invade
iraq
the
oil
company
will
take
business
when
it
s
offer
to
them
but
i
don
t
believe
the
oil
industry
as
you
call
it
push
for
that
war
i
think
that
perception
stem
from
the
fact
that
some
of
the
republican
hawk
be
connect
to
that
industry
how
do
you
judge
president
george
w
bush
george
w
bush
turn
out
to
be
a
very
bad
president
disappointingly
bad
his
father
be
much
well
what
be
bad
about
him
the
iraq
war
be
the
bad
of
course
but
i
don
t
know
a
good
thing
he
do
what
do
you
think
of
barack
obama
it
s
wonderful
that
there
be
a
change
barack
obama
might
be
a
good
president
he
already
change
the
atmosphere
in
the
world
people
again
anticipate
good
thing
to
come
from
america
i
hope
obama
will
be
a
good
president
it
would
be
good
for
the
world
i
would
have
prefer
hillary
clinton
though
do
or
do
you
support
hillary
clinton
financially
no
i
didn
t
and
i
don
t
barack
obama
s
unlikely
rise
to
power
remind
me
of
you
you
both
come
from
humble
origin
and
make
it
to
the
top
yes
but
i
m
not
black
i
m
only
the
black
sheep
you
both
represent
the
classic
american
success
story
the
rest
of
the
world
admires
the
united
state
for
make
such
opportunity
possible
the
united
state
be
an
open
country
and
still
be
an
open
country
i
be
able
to
do
many
thing
there
that
would
have
take
me
longer
elsewhere
business
wise
it
be
a
good
thing
to
do
but
practically
it
be
terrible
in
retrospect
i
should
have
never
go
with
my
company
to
the
united
state
what
be
in
your
opinion
the
three
big
mistake
of
u
s
foreign
policy
over
the
last
fifty
year
cuba
vietnam
iraq
and
the
notion
of
be
all
powerful
and
thus
be
able
to
disregard
everybody
else
s
opinion
and
interest
and
the
three
big
success
i
think
the
big
success
story
of
the
american
be
their
capability
of
renewal
where
do
you
see
the
root
of
the
global
financial
crisis
too
much
credit
too
much
lending
of
money
the
bank
didn
t
control
the
risk
because
of
short
term
think
no
question
about
it
be
you
affected
by
the
crisis
everybody
be
affected
by
this
crisis
how
much
money
do
you
lose
i
won
t
tell
but
you
would
say
that
it
be
the
bad
financial
crisis
ever
for
you
personally
yes
how
will
we
get
out
of
it
we
will
get
out
of
it
but
not
so
fast
how
long
will
it
take
to
overcome
the
crisis
three
to
five
year
i
think
can
the
government
be
part
of
the
solution
probably
they
try
they
provide
the
bank
with
capital
and
credit
that
the
bank
should
pas
on
but
the
bank
don
t
pas
it
on
so
it
be
only
partly
successful
one
of
the
consequence
of
the
financial
crisis
will
be
more
regulation
and
less
free
market
could
be
would
it
be
bad
it
go
in
the
wrong
direction
i
believe
in
the
free
market
government
regulation
be
often
negative
restrictive
and
impedes
the
normal
flow
of
business
political
interventionism
be
the
big
threat
to
efficient
market
will
the
world
be
more
free
or
less
free
in
five
year
broadly
speak
people
will
always
strive
to
be
free
the
quest
for
freedom
be
probably
as
old
as
humanity
let
me
ask
in
a
different
way
will
we
see
more
regulation
and
less
liberalization
liberalization
and
regulation
come
and
go
in
cycle
they
be
the
product
of
the
economic
and
political
landscape
in
a
give
moment
unfortunately
there
seem
to
exist
an
underlie
trend
for
more
regulation
whenever
there
be
a
problem
somewhere
even
if
it
s
a
single
event
affect
few
people
as
long
as
it
get
enough
publicity
some
politician
will
clamor
for
a
new
regulation
or
law
will
the
world
be
more
globalize
or
less
globalize
the
world
will
be
more
globalize
whatever
people
pretend
globalization
be
not
really
a
recent
invention
cross
border
trade
have
be
around
since
people
start
travel
and
exchange
good
how
do
you
see
the
russian
policy
regard
oil
and
other
commodity
the
russian
be
look
firstly
for
themselves
you
can
t
really
blame
them
for
that
foreign
energy
company
in
russia
such
as
royal
dutch
shell
and
british
petroleum
be
force
to
sell
their
stake
to
the
state
company
do
we
witness
a
renationalization
of
the
commodity
market
in
russia
we
be
indeed
see
a
renationalization
of
certain
strategic
sector
how
should
the
west
react
to
this
policy
the
west
be
not
in
a
good
position
to
criticize
the
russian
policy
you
have
only
to
read
the
newspaper
to
see
that
other
country
be
equally
protective
of
their
pet
company
and
national
champion
how
do
you
see
russia
s
future
you
have
to
separate
the
noise
from
the
music
the
music
be
that
russia
will
slowly
slowly
drift
in
the
same
direction
by
and
large
as
most
develop
nation
toward
democracy
and
market
economy
we
live
in
an
age
of
instant
and
all
encompass
information
and
relative
freedom
of
movement
this
mean
that
politician
can
t
fool
people
like
they
use
to
china
have
become
both
a
major
supplier
and
consumer
of
commodity
the
chinese
government
need
to
provide
a
billion
people
with
food
energy
housing
transportation
et
cetera
and
they
want
to
catch
up
with
the
developed
country
this
mean
they
will
want
to
control
as
much
oil
and
other
commodity
as
they
can
lay
their
hand
on
how
will
this
change
the
commodity
market
and
politics
china
be
a
political
and
strategic
player
before
an
economic
one
this
will
clearly
have
an
impact
on
the
market
as
most
other
market
participant
be
guide
purely
by
economic
principle
you
be
trading
with
the
chinese
much
earlier
than
others
what
be
special
or
easy
or
difficult
about
do
business
with
the
chinese
they
play
by
different
rule
than
the
western
company
whoever
believe
he
can
force
his
rule
and
his
value
on
a
chinese
business
partner
will
be
disappointed
by
the
result
if
you
can
play
their
game
you
can
have
success
china
s
policy
regard
commodity
be
consider
quite
aggressive
it
be
invest
billion
in
sudan
and
zimbabwe
whereas
american
company
generally
steer
clear
of
investment
what
be
your
opinion
china
have
the
critical
mass
of
a
world
power
it
be
simply
too
big
and
economically
too
important
to
be
bully
or
boycott
the
chinese
be
obviously
fully
aware
of
this
and
use
it
smartly
to
their
advantage
be
the
european
when
it
come
to
secure
the
supply
of
commodity
naive
they
be
not
naive
but
contrary
to
the
centralistic
run
china
where
the
political
power
be
largely
in
sync
with
the
economic
power
the
european
simply
cannot
speak
with
one
voice
or
act
as
one
entity
why
do
you
think
it
be
acceptable
to
do
business
with
country
and
government
that
be
not
exactly
beacon
of
democracy
and
human
right
take
china
or
vietnam
as
an
example
if
you
sell
them
computer
mobile
phone
and
tv
they
will
be
able
to
see
what
be
go
on
in
the
world
they
will
be
able
to
form
their
own
independent
opinion
which
be
the
most
important
thing
for
any
democracy
by
trading
good
with
these
country
you
actually
help
their
citizen
the
more
contact
there
be
the
well
the
chance
for
everybody
to
improve
one
could
argue
that
do
business
with
such
regime
be
morally
wrong
because
it
only
support
them
the
cuban
as
a
people
for
example
be
not
bad
but
because
of
the
u
s
embargo
many
child
and
old
people
must
suffer
unnecessarily
yet
the
forty
seven
year
old
embargo
have
not
succeed
in
remove
fidel
castro
can
there
be
democracy
without
free
market
and
vice
versa
can
there
be
free
market
without
democracy

temporarily
without
democracy
however
the
combination
of
free
market
and
modern
mean
of
communication
such
as
the
internet
which
free
market
always
adopt
immediately
will
slowly
convert
that
country
into
a
democracy
as
i
be
say
before
politician
can
t
fool
people
like
they
use
to
be
there
any
deal
that
you
would
not
make
for
ethical
reason
i
would
not
engage
in
any
illegal
activity
of
course
have
you
ever
trade
arm
legally
i
mean
we
ve
be
approach
to
become
involve
in
the
arm
business
a
few
time
over
the
year
we
ve
always
point
out
very
clearly
that
it
s
our
policy
not
to
get
involve
in
such
business
neither
i
nor
my
company
sell
trade
or
trafficked
in
arm
for
any
country
include
friendly
country
you
be
very
active
as
a
philanthropist
not
least
in
israel
after
the
lebanon
war
of
and
the
recent
conflict
in
gaza
will
there
ever
be
peace
between
israel
and
the
palestinian
my
foundation
have
make
substantial
effort
to
foster
a
well
understand
between
israeli
and
palestinian
it
s
not
an
easy
task
but
i
believe
the
two
should
be
able
to
live
together
peacefully
sometime
in
the
future
what
be
the
reason
that
there
have
be
no
peace
yet
the
whole
situation
be
hugely
complex
but
one
of
the
reason
be
certainly
the
settler
what
have
to
change
in
order
to
give
peace
a
chance
peace
be
a
long
term
project
in
some
case
tremendously
long
term
it
need
a
certain
economic
well
be
of
the
people
involve
it
need
tolerance
and
the
experience
that
war
and
terrorism
don
t
pay
off
all
of
these
need
to
be
learn
and
it
can
take
generation
until
people
have
accepted
it
do
you
see
the
rise
of
islamist
fundamentalism
in
oil
produce
country
like
iran
or
saudi
arabia
as
a
threat
fundamentalism
of
all
color
be
a
threat
what
would
happen
to
the
global
oil
supply
and
to
the
oil
price
if
fundamentalist
would
take
over
the
power
in
saudi
arabia
the
oil
price
would
become
even
more
volatile
because
of
the
uncertain
and
unpredictable
behavior
natural
to
fundamentalist
and
extremist
of
any
type
but
even
fundamentalist
will
eventually
succumb
to
the
temptation

turn
crude

be
the

for
some
fundamental
question
with
the
benefit
of

what
would
you
have
do
differently
over
the
course
of
your

i
ask

who
turn
up

do
not

i
d
have

i
have
in
america
he
say
i
didn

a
business
deal
whose
legitimacy
or
illegality
have
never
be
determine
in

marc
rich
would
certainly
never
have
be
paint
as
the
big
devil
if
it
have
not
be
for
the
economically
counterproductive
price
control
impose
by

richard

would
never
have
acquire
a
reputation
as
the
big

evader
in

instead
rich
would
still
be
know
today
as
the
genius
in
the
formerly
european
dominate
metal
market
as
he
be
once

have
it
not

s
fall
from

would
speak

him
today
as
the

hero
who
broke
big
oil
s
cartel
and
invent
the
spot
market
for
the

in

he
would
be
described
as
the

dream
the
poor
immigrant
who
would
later
become

one
can
criticize

south
africa

to
nigeria

put

above

it
would
be
easy
to

the
way
of
the

the

the

add
it

worth

that
these

resonate
in
my

some
time

nowadays
this
phrase

usually
use

we
may
