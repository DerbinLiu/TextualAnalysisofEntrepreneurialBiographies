for
anyone
hop

as
the
historian
jerry

reminds
us
people
living
in
the
atlantic
region
of
canada
be
neither
peripheral
nor
irrelevant
to
the
human
story
and
they
deserve
a
history
that
engages
with
the

this

the

of

it
contains
a
grain
of

that
warrant
examination
while
no

imagination
write
the
history
of
nova
scotia
john
g
reid
argues
be
a
risky
undertaking
require
the
author
to
decide
at
the
outset
how
to
frame
the
narrative
do
one
focus
on
the
current
boundary
or
on
the
shape
shift
geography
that
at
various
time
carry
the
name
nova
scotia
i
decide
to
explore
nova
scotia
in
its
several
guise
which
include
the
large
region
know
variously
as
mi
kma
ki
acadie
and
the
maritimes
new
brunswickers
and
prince
edward
islander
who
also
share
these
designation
no
doubt
will
complain
that
this
be
yet
another
example
of
nova
scotia
s
aspiration
for
imperial
dominance
it
must
be
ever
thus
nova
scotia
have
be
central
to
define
the
maritimes
and
in
turn
the
large
regional
context
have
define
nova
scotia
all

choice
about
which
topic
to
pursue
in
craft
their
narrative
the
political
space
call
nova
scotia
inevitably
shape
the
selection
process
but
my
particular
goal
have
be
to
explore
how
the
people
living
in
that
space
sustain
themselves
economically
and
socially
over
time
and
what
value
inspire
their
choice
with
the
arrival
of
european

in
the
seventeenth
century

on
the

and
gathering

of
the
mi

and
both
be
transform
by
the
industrial
revolution
which
along
with
its
economic
and
technological
impact
inspire
new
way
of
think
about
the
world
by
the
nineteenth
century
the
tenet
of
liberalism
individual
initiative
democratic
accountability
civil
liberty
the
rule
of
law
property
right
capitalist
enterprise
and
separation
of
church
and
state
have
triumphed
but
old
aristocratic
communal
and
spiritual
value
continued
to
evolve
and
inspire
loyalty
notion
of
class
ethnic
gender
and
religious
difference
manage
to
survive
even
the
most
disruptive
transformation
and
so
too
do
practice
relate
to
care
for
others
and
sheer
cussedness
none
of
which
translate
into
narrow
cost

analysis
since
liberalism
be
a
grand
but
elusive
idea
the
detail
of
its
unfold
in
specific
landscape
such
as
nova
scotia
require
careful
scrutiny
in
british
prime
minister
margaret
thatcher
famously
assert
that
there
be
no
such

individual
men
and
woman
and
family
family
and
individual
figure
prominently
in
what
follow
indeed
i
argue
that
nova
scotia
s
identity
coalesce
at
a
time
when
possessive
individualism
be
in
ascendance
but
i
also
attend
to
the
richly
textured
society
that
family
and
individual
create
through
their
associational
effort
these
include
political
structure
that

from
the

both

and

none
of
the
trend
outline
above
be
unique
to
nova
scotia
whose
people
share
an
atlantic
culture
with
europe
africa
and
the
america
for
more
than
half
a
millennium
nova
scotians
have
be
make
adjustment
within
this
broad
and
ever
change
template
which
be
now
global
in
scope
neoliberal
might
well
believe
that
the
maritime
province
buffer
by
transfer
payment
from
the
federal
government
and
bedevil
by
outmigration
be
fail
state
in
wait
but
they
still
enjoy
with
other
canadian
province
the
luxury
of
what
by
world
standard
be
relatively
peaceful
and
self

this
outcome
be
largely
due
to
the
complicate
evolution
of

nevertheless
attribute
the

to
other
cause

that

out

to
enter

the
immediate
financial
difficulty
that

it

although
there

that

there
be
some
question
about

with

that
canada

tilley
might
have
be
dimly
aware
of
this

his
inspiration
almost
certainly
come
from
a
recent
reading
of

the

it
be
an
appropriate
choice
one
calculate
to
avoid
the
word

which
seem
pretentious
in

might
well
