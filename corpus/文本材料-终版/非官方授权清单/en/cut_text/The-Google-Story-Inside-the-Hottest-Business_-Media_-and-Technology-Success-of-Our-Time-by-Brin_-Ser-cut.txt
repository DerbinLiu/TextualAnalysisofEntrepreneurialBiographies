good
phrase
you

thing
that
most
people
would
not
as
proponent
of

important
problem
and
seek
transformative
solution
brin

page
be
certainly
arm
with
a
healthy
disregard
for
the
impossible
and
while
not

the

the

the

by
give
them
free
instant
access
to

about
any

by
be
devilishly
clever
in
the

age
they
have
create
the
best
know
new
brand
in
the
world
without
advertising
to
promote
the
name
the
two
be
astute
businessmen
and
knew
that
to
succeed
over
time
it
be
imperative
that
they
remain
in
complete
control
of
their
privately
own
business
and
its
quirky
culture
it
sadden
page
that
many
inventor
die
without
ever
see
the
fruit
of
their
labor
determine
to
avoid
a
similar
fate
he
and
brin
understood
how
to
use
the
right
connection
access
to
money
and
brilliant
mind
raw
compute
power
and
a
culture
of
limitless
possibility
to
make
google
a
beacon
and
a
magnet
in
the
click
of
a

it
have
replace
microsoft
as
the
place
for
the
world
s
top
technologist
to
work
yet
they
knew
that
maintain
the
pace
of
innovation
and
the
mantle
of
leadership
would
be
no
easy
feat
since
they
face
a
deeper
pocket
competitor
in
microsoft
and
a
ruthless
combatant
in
its
chief
the
billionaire
bill
gate
supremely
confident
about
their
achievement
and
vision
brin
and
page
have
be
on
a
roll
ever
since
they
start
work
together
they
want
no
one
neither
competitor
nor
outside
investor
to
come
between
them
or
interfere
in
any
way
that
combination
of
dependence
on
each
other
and
independence
from
everyone
else
have
contribute
immeasurably
to
their
astound
success
so
i
start
download
the
web
and
sergey
start
help
me
because
he
be
interested
in
data
mining
and
make
sense
of
the
information
page
go
on
continue
with
the
pair
s
history
when
we
first
met
each
other
we
thought
the
other
be
really
obnoxious
then
we
hit
it
off
and
become
really
good
friend
that
be
about
eight
year
ago
and
we
start
work
really
really
hard
on
it
he
stress
this
critical
point
inspiration
still
require
plenty
of
perspiration
there
be
an
important
lesson
for
us
we
work
through
holiday
and
work
many
many
hour
a
day
it
end
up
work
out
but
it
be
hard
because
it
take
a
lot
of
effort
page
say
that
as
they
told
friend
about
google
more
and
more
people
start
use
it
pretty
soon
we
have
search
a
day
at
stanford
and
we
sat
around
the
room
and
look
at
the
machine
and
say
this
be
about
how
many
search
we
can
do
and
we
need
more
computer
our
whole
history
have
be
like
that
we
always
need
more
computer
it
be
a
sentiment
the
student
and
teacher
at
the
school
could
relate
to
so
we
start
a
company
be
in
silicon
valley
at
this
time
it
be
relatively
easy
to
do
you
have
a
number
of
very
excellent
company
here
as
well
he
add
allude
to
the
grow
technology
sector
in
israel
so
this
be
also
a
good
environment
to
do
thing
like
that
we
start
up
the
company
and
it
grow
and
grow
and
grow
and
that
be
why
we
be
here
so
that
he
conclude
be
the
google
story
but
there
be
something
more
he
want
to
convey
closing
word
of
inspiration
let
me
explain
to
you
guy
why
i
be
so
excite
about
be
here
page
say
and
it
be
really
that
there
be
so
much
leverage
in
science
and
technology
i
think
most
people
don
t
really
realize
that
there
be
so
much
that
can
be
do
with
these
new
technology
we
be
an
example
of
that
two
kind
of
crazy
kid
have
have
a
big
impact
on
the
world
because
of
the
power
of
the
internet
the
power
of
the
distribution
and
the
power
of
software
and
computer
and
there
be
so
many
thing
like
that
out
there
there
be
so
many
opportunity
where
you
can
have
a
huge
impact

thing
here
that
i
didn
t
have
when
i

go
through
high
school
the
first
one
be
the
beautiful
weather
and
the
window

maryland
which
be
built
during
the
s
energy
crisis
have
three
foot
thick
wall
and
no
window
you
be
very
fortunate
to
be
in
such
a
beautiful
set
the
other
thing
we
didn
t
have
back
then
be
internet
access
let
me
get
a
show
of
hand
how
many
of
you
use
the
internet
yesterday
virtually
every
hand
in
the
auditorium
shot
up
anybody
do
any
search
once
again
the
hand
go
up
brin
knew
that
technology
savvy
and
information
hungry
israeli
love
google
and
use
it
heavily
but
he
couldn
t
resist
have
a
little
fun
with
the
student
he
have
a
playful
side
to
his
personality
that
many
found
endear
but
he
have
a
mischievous
side
too
which
some
found
baffling
because
they
couldn
t
always
tell
when
he
be
be
serious
when
he
be
be
too
clever
for
them
to
follow
and
when
he
be
just
kid
around
do
you
use
altavista
he
ask
raise
his
right
hand
to
signal
student
what
to
do
if
they
have
use
the
first
major
search
engine
that
google
have
left
in
the
dust
excite
he
ask
listing
another
erstwhile
search
engine
just
curious
brin
go
on
without
break
cadence
what
search
engine
you
use
here
without
a
pause
which
would
have
reveal
that
he
be
joking
with
the
student
he
return
to
the
message
he
have
begin
deliver
grow
up
i
didn
t
have
the
internet
or
not
in
its
current
form
and
the
world
wide
web
he
say
today
the
world
be
very
different
because
each
of
you
have
the
power
to
get
information
about
any
subject
in
the
world
and
that
be
very
very
different
from
when
i
go
to
school
for
a
moment
imagine
yourself
a
bright
teenager
take
in
every
word
deliver
by
sergey
brin
you
listen
carefully
to
him
not
only
because
of
what
he
already
have
do
but
also
because
he
be
a
youthful
russian
you
think
about
where
he
seem
to
be
go
through
a
blend
of
moxie
and
technology
and
what
he
be
tell
you
about
yourself
and
your
own
potential
you
really
have
a
lot
of
power
that
our
generation
do
not
brin
say
i
think
that
will
enable
you
to
succeed
earlier
in
life
and
much
more
in
life
than
i
do
finally
the
most
important
thing
i
didn
t
have
grow
up
which
all
of
you
do
be
all
of
your
wonderful
peer
who
be
also
very
hardworking
and
inspire
i
shouldn
t
say
bad
thing
about
my
peer
but
my
school
be
a
little
bit
different
it
be
in
the
suburb
of
washington
dc
and
the
academic
standard
and
the
child
s
goal
be
different
you
should
really
value
what
you
have
here
with
such
an
incredibly
talented
peer
group
i
be
sure
you
be
go
to
know
many
of
your
classmate
for
the
rest
of
your
life
brin
and
page
wrap
up
their
talk
and
indicate
to
the
assemble
student
that
it
be
time
for
question
none
be
aware
of
the
commotion
that
have
just
kick
up
outside
the
auditorium
or
whom
it
involve
or
what
it
would
soon
mean
for
all
of
them
do
you
think
google
be
the
highlight
of
your
career
the
first
student
ask
brin
and
page
i
think
it
be
the
small
of
accomplishment
that
we
hope
to
make
over
the
next
year
say
brin
but
i
think
that
if
google
be
all
we
create
i
don
t
think
i
would
be
very
disappointed
page
felt
otherwise
i
would
be
very
disappointed
he
say
we
have
many
year
left
to
go
the
next
student
ask
about
new
project
under
way
at
google
we
run
google
a
little
bit
like
a
university
brin
explain
we
have
lot
of
project
about
of
them
we
like
to
have
small
group
of
people
three
or
so
people
work
on
project
some
of
them
for
example
be
related
to
molecular
biology
others
involve
building
hardware
so
we
do
lot
of
stuff
the
only
way
you
be
go
to
have
success
be
to
have
lot
of
failure
first
the
student
applaud
the
idea
of
eventually
succeed
after
fail
first
of
not
be
afraid
to
fall
down
resonate
with
them
immediately
israeli
be
risk
taker
by
nature
russian
much
less
so
yet
the
family
of
these
russian
student
have
risk
the
unknown
by
leave
their
home
in
search
of
a
well
life
now
here
they
be
sit
with
two
of
the
world
s
lead
thinker
probe
and
laugh
in
way
that
reflect
the
freedom
they
enjoy
and
that
seem
just
as
important
to
the
google
founder
since
the
question
have
not
really
be
answer
another
student
ask
again
about
new
google
project
we
be
embarrass
about
our
new
project
brin
say
tee
up
a
joke
maybe
one
very
recent
one
come
from
israel
yossi
vardi
the
inventor
of
instant
message
have
a
friend
who
make
underwear
calvin
klein
underwear
so
we
be
try
to
see
if
we
can
forge
a
partnership
to
have
google
brand
underwear
if
google
have
underwear
who
will
buy
it
he
ask
hand
shot
up
we
will
have
to
send
a
shipment
to
the
school
brin
say
add
that
be
probably
one
of
the
less
technical
project
we
have
a
project
that
be
closer
to
our
heart
he
continued
involves
translation
and
i
be
ask
about
hebrew
to
english
which
be
not
one
of
the
one
we
be
work
on
one
of
the
most
important
aspect
of
information
access
be
that
a
lot
of
information
be
not
in
language
that
you
understand
we
have
an
exist
translation
service
but
we
think
we
can
make
it
exceptionally
well
what
another
student
ask
do
the
name
google
mean
google
mean
a
very
large
number
page
say
it
be
the
number
follow
by
zero
and
we
be
try
to
come
up
with
a
name
we
be
confuse
about
how
to
spell
this
and
so
we
actually
spell
it
incorrectly
it
be
a
mathematical
term
and
it
be
spell
g
o
o
g
o
l
so
that
be
the
right
way
google
be
spell
most
people
don
t
know
that
fortunately
be
there
any
plan
a
student
ask
to
promote
commercial
site
in
google
s
search
result
we
don
t
let
that
be
influence
by
any
business
relationship
brin
say
add
that
the
search
engine
s
result
be
unbiased
that
prompt
a
new
question
how
do
google
make
money
google
get
paid
for
every
search
that
happens
more
or
less
mostly
through
advertising
page
say
people
pay
for
advertising
we
be
very
lucky
in
that
we
chose
to
make
ad
relevant
rather
than
have
flash
banner
ad
it
help
us
have
the
best
search
engine
we
also
get
paid
by
other
company
like
aol
that
use
our
search
engine
a
student
ask
what
they
thought
about
pornography
say
it
be
all
over
the
internet
and
that
people
use
google
to
find
it
naturally
it
depends
on
what
you
search
for
sergey
reply
apparently
dodge
the
question
then
he
continued
i
want
to
tell
you
about
something
else
larry
and
i
share
in
common
both
of
us
at
a
very
early
age
go
to
something
call
a
montessori
school
the
theory
of
montessori
be
you
let
kid
do
a
lot
of
what
they
want
when
they
be
six
seven
eight
nine
ten
eleven
twelve
but
after
that
because
of
the
hormone
that
boy
have
you
actually
need
to
send
them
to
do
hard
labor
in
their
teen
otherwise
their
mind
get
distract
brin
seem
to
be
subtly
answer
the
pornography
question
after
all
in
this
case
there
be
many
way
to
apply
yourselves
you
don
t
have
to
do
hard
labor
on
the
farm
but
it
be
important
to
maintain
focus
even
through
these
difficult
year
another
student
ask
about
google
s
competition
it
start
off
be
excite
altavista
and
others
page
say
they
be
not
that
focus
on
search
so
we
didn
t
have
as
much
trouble
with
them
as
we
could
have
nowadays
we
get
much
large
competition
and
it
be
a
big
challenge
for
us
google
be
go
to
probably
be
a
medium
size
technology
company
we
have
over
people
who
work
at
google
we
be
start
to
have
office
all
around
the
world
that
be
part
of
why
we
be
travel
around
this
be
the
real
test
for
us
the
tough
part
be
whether
we
can
do
it
for
the
long
term
a
to
year
old
company
or
whether
we
will
be
overtaken
to
just
invent
something
and
have
a
great
idea
be
a
lot
of
work
page
go
on
but
it
be
not
enough
you
have
to
get
it
out
in
the
world
at
google
it
be
a
combination
of
scientific
skill
and
mathematical
skill
and
computer
skill
and
also
very
strong
skill
about
how
to
get
people
excite
about
their
work
just
then
the
eye
in
the
room
dart
away
from
brin
and
page
to
two
men
walk
in
the
back
door
of
the
auditorium
a
wave
of
excitement
swept
the
room
as
the
student
and
brin
and
page
too
realize
who
it
be
mikhail
gorbachev
the
former

for
his
dour
expression
reach
out
to
them
and
to
brin

page
with
a
look
of
satisfaction
i

mini
soviet

they
talk
endlessly
about

philosophy
and
whatever
else
popped
into
their

once
they
argue
loudly
about
whether
it

you
just
hop
in
and
tell
it
where
it
need
to
go
it
be
like

tighter
anderson

who
have
be
sergey

since
his
arrival
at

in
watch
the
intellectual

he
grow
increasingly
fond

them
they
be
both
brilliant
some
of
the
smartest
people
i
have
ever
met
motwani
say
but
they
be
brilliant
in
different
way
sergey
be
practical
a
problem
solver
an
engineer
if
something
work
it
work
he
be
also
mathematical
lightning
fast
and
outgo
he
be
the
brash
young
man
but
he
be
so
smart
it
just
ooze
out
of
him
motwani
say
whenever
he
need
or
want
something
brin
would
just
barge
into
motwani
s
office
without
knock

you
wouldn

notice
larry
if
he
be
in

but
then
afterward
he
would
say
hey
what
do
you
think
of
this
idea
sergey
s
manner
differ
from
that
of
typical
stanford
ph

student
he
carry
himself
with
a

he
be
very
direct
the
intensity
be
not
common
say
dennis
allison
another
stanford
professor
sergey
be
very
present
he
be
able
to
convey
the
fact
that
he
be
aware
of
you
talk
directly
at

and
want
to

closely
with
motwani
on
find

they
have
start
a

group
call
midas
the

at

brin
line
up
the

speaker
and
chose
the
topic
for
midas
discussion
he
and
motwani
also
team
up
and
write
a
number
of
paper
together
on
the
subject
while
data
mining
can
be
use
to
determine
what
combination
of
item
customer
purchase
in

so
that
retailer
can
arrange

well
brin

apply
the

technique
to
the

million

hotbot
fell

be
not
pretty
in
those
day
motwani
say
you
d
get
a
slew
of
result
that
be
completely
meaningless
motwani
have
test
a
search
engine
call
inktomi
in
after
it
be
developed
at
berkeley
where
he
have
receive
his
ph

he
typed
in

what
would
happen
sure
enough
say
motwani
it
wasn

there
it
couldn
t
find

meanwhile
stanford
doctoral
candidate
jerry
yang
and
david
filo
take
a
different
approach
to
search
rather
than
rely
on
technology
alone
they
employ
a
team
of
editor
who
select
web
site
for
an
alphabetize
directory
they
call
their
company
yahoo
although
their
approach
simplify
find
valuable
information
it
be
not
comprehensive
and
it
could
not
keep
pace
with
the
fast
growth
of
the
web
brin
and
motwani
also
try
other
directory
and
search
engine
but
nothing
get
the
job
do
instead
a
simple
search
would
yield
hundred
or
thousand
of
result
in
no
discernible
order
it
take
them
hour
to
sift
through
the

manually
to

they
be

brin

anderson

people
take
ownership

it

brilliant
allison

if
you
go

firm

ask
for
a

for

you

that
it
doesn
t

any

and
there
be
no
sound

light
it
fly
completely
in
the
face
of
the
common
belief
that
people
love
to
find
their

through
the
noise
as
the

grow
brin

need
more
computer
short
of
cash
they
save
money
by

building
their

scrounge

we

they

on
the

they

to
get

the
soon

it
would
improve
their

and
give
altavista
s
percent

it
seem
logical
that
the

the

would
then
be

at

to
flaherty
offer
an
explanation
of
how
altavista
work
the
google
guy
knew
they
have
something
well
still
one
of
the
thing
flaherty
say
lodge
in
their
mind
that
the
entire
altavista
database
if
print
out
would
amount
to
a
stack
of
paper
mile
high
and
that
the
search
engine
could
pull
any
word
out
of
that
stack
in
less
than
half
a

the

flaherty
agree
that
the

have
a
cool
concept
i
felt
they
really
have
something
with
their

base
approach
to

rank
which
be
altavista
s
technical
weakness
at
the
time
flaherty
say
but
he
also
sound
a
note
of
caution
problem
and
headache
happen
on
the

after
you
become

he
told
them
people
try
to
break
into
your

attack
your

and
manipulate
your
search
system
but
page
and
brin
weren
t
afraid
instead
they
brim
with
confidence
and
want
their

in

of
more
people
they

what
they
be
able

very
anxious
to

it
they
be
basically

in

polite
way
altavista
be
dead
meat
it

what

a
few
week
after

the

if
it

morning
in

on
the

the
pair
have
be
work
day
and
night
on
their
new
way
to
search
the

but
despite
be
economical
and
save
money
wherever
possible
they
have
run
out
of
cash
one
of
their
graduate
school
professor
david
cheriton
suggest
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
them
to
meet
his
friend
andy
bechtolsheim
a
computer
whiz
and
legendary
investor
in
a
string
of
successful
start
ups
bechtolsheim
pull
up
in
front
of
cheriton
s
house
in
his
silver
porsche
hopped
out
of
the
car
and
make
his
way
to
the
porch
where
the
trio
be
wait
for
him
like
a
handful
of
other
wealthy
entrepreneur
in
silicon
valley
bechtolsheim
work
hard
even
though
he
didn
t
need
the
money
because
he
be
passionate
about
the
power
of
technology
and
love
find
new
way
to
solve
problem
he
be
also
quite
modest
many
of
those
who
work
on
technology
project
with
bechtolsheim
at
cisco
system
where
he
serve
as
a
vice
president
have
no
idea
he
be
a
cofounder
of
sun
microsystems
and
have
found
and
sell
another
firm
to
cisco
two
year
earlier
for
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
cheriton
have
pique
bechtolsheim
s
interest
in
brin
and
page
by
tell
him
that
the
student
have
a
great
idea
to
show
him
they
have
invent
a
well
way
to
find
relevant
information
fast
on
the
internet
he
seem
interested
i
use
the
internet
at
the
time
primarily
for
search
bechtolsheim
say
and
part
of
my
frustration
be
that
altavista
which
be
the
standard
be
not
very
good
he
want
to
learn
more
how
far
could
the
guy
run
with
the
idea
page
confidently
told
bechtolsheim
that
they
could
download
index
and
rapidly
search
the
entire
internet
use
a
network
of
low
cost
personal
computer
the
only
problem
be
that
they
didn
t
have
the
money
to
buy
the
machine
bechtolsheim
like
the
idea
but
wonder
about
its
commercial
viability
since
altavista
and
other
search
engine
on
the
market
be
lose
money
some
people
even
saw
search
engine
as
commodity
a
kind
of
card
catalog
for
the
world
wide
web
that
have
no
sustainable
edge
or
endure
competitive
advantage
bechtolsheim
wasn
t
sure
if
that
be
the
correct
analysis
after
all
many
year
before
a
single
innovation
the
dewey
decimal
system
have
change
the
way
million

be
organize
in
library
around
the
world
sit
on
the
porch
that
morning
brin
and
page
felt
at
ease
with
bechtolsheim
and
he
like
their
moxie
during
the
course
of
his
hectic
day
bechtolsheim
regularly
learn
about
plenty
of
gee
whiz
technology
that
didn
t
translate
into
terrific
business
throughout
the
high
tech
boom
take
place
around
him
as
new
company
with
com
in
their
name
seem
to
go
public
every
second
bechtolsheim
retain
a
healthy
skepticism
for
fancy
powerpoint
presentation
that
wowed
others
he
have
a
way
of
keep
his
head
about
him
by
proceed
with
simple
method
of
evaluate
new
venture
he
didn
t
like
to
bet
on
promise
instead
he
look
for
several
thing
idea
that
solve
real
problem
he
could
understand
business
with
the
potential
to
produce
real
profit
and
bright
passionate
and
capable
founder
he
also
trust
his
instinct
and
a
handful
of
silicon
valley
colleague
cheriton
a
professor
with
business
experience
and
savvy
be
among
this
coterie
of
technology
expert
cheriton
in
turn
knew
that
bechtolsheim
s
involvement
with
this
or
any
other
venture
could
dramatically
increase
its
prospect
for
success
not
only
because
of
his
financial
backing
but
also
because
of
his
connection
with
the
lead
money
men
and
technologist
of
silicon
valley
as
well
as
the
rigorous
way
he
scrutinize
new
idea
and
young
talent
as
bechtolsheim
engage
in
dialogue
with
the
student
that
morning
he
could
immediately
tell
that
they
be
intelligent
and
driven
even
if
they
be
short
on
money
and
experience
after
brin
and
page
displayed
the
demo
and
chat
with
him
bechtolsheim
appreciate
and
understood
the
breakthrough
that
enable
google
to
produce
superior
search
result
he
also
admire
something
else
about
brin
and
page
instead
of
waste
lot
of
money
on
advertising
or
high
end
equipment
they
want
to
buy
motherboards
and
other
component
to
inexpensively
build
computer
themselves
they
also
want
to
develop
a
fully
searchable
database
before
go
out
to
talk
to
venture
capital
firm
about
possible
funding
and
they
want
to
let
their
search
engine
speak
for
itself
other
web
site
take
a
good
chunk
of
venture
funding
and
spent
it
on
advertising
bechtolsheim
say
they
believe
in
word
of
mouth
this
be
the
opposite
approach
build
something
of
value
and
deliver
a
service
compelling
enough
that
people
would
just
use
it
satisfied
that
he
have
see
and
understood
a
demonstration
of
a
well
technology
that
have
the
potential
to
address
a
real
problem
bechtolsheim
waste
no
time
ask
about
the
bottom
line
the
key
question
with
any
internet
start
up
be
how
be
you
go
to
make
money
he
say
i
never
get
suck
into
idea
with
no
economic
merit
he
review
various
possibility
build
an
audience
of
computer
user
by
give
away
the
google
search
engine
for
free
and
then
profit
from
ad
or
by
sell
something
larry
and
sergey
have
an
instinctive
aversion
to
advertising
couple
with
a
deep
seat
fear
that
it
would
corrupt
search
result
they
have
make
that
clear
in
a
paper
they
have
write
about
the
search
engine
they
also
talk
with
bechtolsheim
about
licensing
search
technology
to
company
that
would
pay
to
use
it
and
there
be
always
the
possibility
that
a
large
company
might
buy
the
technology
and
include
it
in
its
mix
of
product
to
bechtolsheim
the
search
engine
conjure
up
the
image
of
an
electronic
searchable
directory
similar
to
the
yellow
page
where
clearly
marked
display
ad
appear
on
the
same
page
as
phone
listing
for
plumber
tennis
racket
or
any
other
product
or
service
this
be
the
single
best
idea
i
have
heard
in
year
bechtolsheim
say
i
want
to
be
part
of
this
neither
brin
nor
page
knew
exactly
how
to
respond
bechtolsheim
who
have
do
this
many
time
before
make
it
easy
for
them
he
propose
immediately
write
a
check
so
they
could
build
their
computer
and
he
could
be
on
his
way
to
his
next
appointment
no
negotiation
no
discussion
of
stock
or
valuation
bechtolsheim
didn
t
even
know
that
brin
and
page
have
not
formally
create
a
company
but
detail
like
those
didn
t
bother
him
he
never
forgot
the
way
an
early
investor
in
sun
have
once
hand
him
a
check
on
the
spur
of
the
moment

give
that
individual
immediate
involvement
in
what
turn
out
to
be
an
extremely
valuable
enterprise
he
want
to
do
the
same
thing
with

recall
bechtolsheim
write
a
check
make
out
to
google
inc
for
a
figure
he
picked
because
it
be
a
nice
round
number
page
put
the
check
in
his
desk
drawer
for
safekeeping
where
it
remain
for
two
week
until
the

incorporate

seek
money
from

it

computer
science
a

describe
their

to
write
software
that
truly
broke
new
ground
and
open
up
new
possibility
for
innovation
and
it
be
a
critical
difference
plenty
of
people
around
stanford
have
great
idea
and
many
be
highly
motivate
but
few
be
able
to
execute
their
idea
and
overcome
the
hurdle

against
them
what
he
admire

the
way
they
held
fast
to
their
bold
dream
of
change
the

they
be
really
driven
by
a
vision
of
how

not
to
make
money
allison
say
the
idea
of
digitize
the
entirety
of
the
universe
and
make
it
work
be
something
nobody
be
willing
to
tackle
but
lot
of
people
knew
need
to
be
do
they
manage
to
get
that
together
and
bulldoze
through
the
limitation
and
with
some
luck
it
be
actually
go

in
academia
and
the
other
on
the

out
the
door
to
launch
a

this
be
their
major
opportunity
to
discus
and
present
their
finding
to
a
large
group
and
get
feedback
in
the

where
the
concept
have
be
hatch
they

be
warn
by
many
people
that
once
they
left

and
that
s
larry
over
there
i
m
gonna
jump
right
into
it
here
brin
begin
in
his
typically
informal
style
he
open
with
an
example
of
a
person
go
on
a
trip
who
typed
the
word
rental
car
into
another
search
engine
the
problem
with
the
result
he
explain
be
that
they
be
ranked
solely
by
counting
the
number
of
time
the
word
rental
and
car
appear
on
various
web
page
in
contrast
type
rental
car
into
google
would
give
enhance
search
result
base
on
relevance
with
a
savvy
audience
watch
brin
typed
the
term
into
google
and
show
that
the
top
result
be
the
official
web
site
for
avis
national
dollar
alamo
and
others
swiftly
plucked
from
the
million
of
page
on
the
world
wide
web
what
we
ve
try
to
do
with
our
search
engine
be
not
give
outrageous
answer
base
on
the
count
of
word
in
the
text
brin
explain
the
research
start
something
close
to
three
year
ago
that
research
basically
lead
to
innovation
about
how
important
a
web
page
be
and
the
pagerank
algorithm
which
be
a
major
component
of
the
google
search
engine
that
i
m
gonna
tell
you
about
today
while
it
be
easy
to
talk
about
the
way
web
site
link
to
one
another
it
be
more
complex
to
derive
meaningful
search
result
by
somehow
take
these
link
into
consideration
along
with
dozen
of
other
factor
but
that
be
what
it
take
to
devise
a
well
search
engine
to
get
there
one
have
to
think
about
the
motivation
of
the
web
site
operator
who
establish
the
link
in
the
first
place
they
sought
to
direct
computer
user
to
valuable
information
elsewhere
on
the
internet
and
hop
that
this
in
turn
would
bring
more
visit
to
their
own
site
let
me
tell
you
what
the
challenge
be
of
a
search
engine
brin
say
you
have
to
index
the
entire
web
quite
a
bit
of
data
we
ll
show
you
how
to
manage
it
we
ll
tell
you
what
it
be
we
do
to
generate
well
search
result
what
we
expect
to
get
into
three
year
down
the
road
and
the
social
issue
also
for
those
with
the
inclination
and
time
to
get
into
more
technical
explanation
brin
invite
them
to
sign
up
for
a
course
that
he
and
page
be
teach
that
semester
on
search
engine
and
promise
the
student
access
to
resource
which
you
cannot
find
anywhere
else
in
the
world
for
the
time
be
however
brin
and
page
would
use
the
next
hour
to
do
their
best
to
explain
the
basic
of
how
they
developed
the
google
search
engine
what
be
it
brin
say
that
allows
you
to
build
a
search
engine
in
the
first
place
it
be
a
rhetorical
question
but
just
in
case
someone
in
the
room
didn
t
quite
understand
that
he
continued
without
skip
a
beat
there
be
million
of
web
site
out
there
hundred
of
million
of
web
page
at
last
count
earlier
this
year
we
be
at
million
web
page
brin
say
so
how
do
you
do
this
well
it
turn
out
that
it
isn
t
so
bad
on
our
side
we
have
moore
s
law
nothing
be
more
important
or
critical
to
innovation
than
understand
the
basic
of
moore
s
law
in
the
mid
s
an
engineer
name
gordon
moore
one
of
the
founder
of
intel
predict
that
there
would
be
a
double
in
compute
power
every
few
year
without
this
the
trend
lead
from
the
giant
supercomputer
that
be
the
province
of
corporation
and
university
and
government
would
never
have
lead
to
the
invention
of
the
personal
computer
which
empower
the
individual
in
dramatic
fashion
the
trend
he
predict
occur
over
and
over
again
as
the
year
pass
what
brin
be
explain
now
be
how
moore
s
law
apply
to
building
a
search
engine
to
survey
the
entire
internet
at
the
same
time
that
people
be
generate
all
this
text
and
stuff
disk
be
get
a
lot
faster
we
will
be
able
to
put
all
human
knowledge
and
any
information
people
generate
into
your
pocket
exclude
video
feed
in
the
next
couple
decade
brin
say
confidently
all
this
stuff
be
doable
you
keep
it
all
in
one
central
place
you
can
process
over
this
stuff
which
be
what
we
ve
do
the
problem
brin
say
be
that
people
can
t
process
thousand
of
search
result
human
unfortunately
be
not
subject
to
moore
s
law
right
now
they
ve
be
evolve
a
little
bit
slow
that
s
a
big
problem
really
we
need
to
address
that
the
audience
laugh
have
receive
the
check
from
andy
bechtolsheim
and
have
make
the
decision
to
take
a
leave
of
absence
from
the
stanford
ph
d
program
brin
want
to
let
the
academic
expert
know
the
general
direction
that
he
and
larry
be
head
we
be
in
the
process
of
commercialize
google
and
you
should
see
it
at
google
com
sometime
in
the
near
future
there
be
several
thing
that
we
use
to
make
our
search
engine
well
right
now
and
a
few
detail
i
will
not
get
into
listen
to
brin
allison
recognize
that
like
science
fiction
this
stuff
be
easy
to
talk
about
than
it
be
to
execute
flawlessly
but
if
anyone
could
do
it
allison
sense
it
be
the
google
guy
and
they
be
well
on
their
way
the
google
search
engine
take
more
factor
into
account
than
any
other
search
engine
on
the
market
it
didn
t
just
count
word
or
count
link
and
deliver
result
it
combine
information
about
link
and
word
with
other
variable
in
new
and
interest
way
that
produce
well
search
result
for
example
brin
say
it
matter
whether
word
or
phrase
on
web
page
be
close
together
or
far
apart
what
their
font
size
be
whether
they
be
capitalize
or
in
lowercase
type
we
try
not
to
throw
away
too
much
information
he
say
we
take
a
user
approach
we
sacrifice
a
lot
of
compute
power
to
produce
good
result
but
that
s
what
it
take
do
quality
search
not
only
require
the
right
mathematical
formula
and
equation
in
the
software
but
fundamentally
and
importantly
it
require
much
great
compute
power
than
any
exist
search
engine
on
the
market
have
yet
employ
it
be
fine
with
larry
and
sergey
that
others
overlook
this
critical
ingredient
in
the
search
recipe
but
they
have
understood
from
the
start
that
the
only
way
to
deliver
quality
search
result
to
computer
user
be
to
invest
as
nobody
have
before
in
computer
the
pair
not
only
plan
to
develop
software
they
also
intend
to
focus
enormous
attention
on
every
aspect
of
the
computer
network
because
this
too
be
part
of
deliver
the
best
search
result
the
software
and
hardware
be
inextricably
intertwine
and
optimize
them
be
essential
they
knew
that
they
would
benefit
from
the
fall
price
and
increase
power
of
computer
memory
and
other
component
they
would
exploit
their
innate
ability
to
develop
the
software
buy
the
component
and
build
cheap
clone
pc
themselves
that
could
handle
the
task
their
vision
encompass
a
more
holistic
approach
to
deliver
high
quality
search
result
than
anyone
else
have
conceive
of
and
execute
as
dennis
allison
listen
to
the
talk
he
reflect
on
his
experience
with
brin
and
page
at
stanford
he
admire
them
they
be
trustworthy
and
want
to
do
the
right
thing
strip
away
all
the
technical
knowledge
and
what
you
found
be
two
young
guy
with
character
that
would
translate
well
into
the
work
they
do
especially
in
a
field
where
people
need
to
trust
you
to
trust
your
product
they
be
also
in
allison
s
view
computer
nerd
with
an
unusually
wide
array
of
outside
interest
a
combination
necessary
for
success
in
the
world
at
large
they
be
social
progressive
which
in
silicon
valley
meant
that
they
favor
free
and
open
software
system
rather
than
the
close
system
that
bill
gate
and
microsoft
generally
prefer
and
they
be
highly
opinionated
too
they
don
t
like
some
of
the
thing
that
happen
in
corporate
america
and
have
not
a
caution
in
the
world
about
state
that
allison
say
as
page
take
charge
of
the
talk
allison
continued
to
be
impressed
larry
be
a
very
good
teacher
he
could
find
the
key
idea
in
something
and
express
it
in
a
nontechnical
way
so
that
everyone
understood
to
allison
that
be
the
mark
of
a
clear
head
thinker
who
knew
his
stuff
every
time
you
create
a
link
page
told
the
hush
audience
you
ve
create
a
citation
but
if
you
just
try
to
count
citation
on
the
web
which
be
what
a
lot
of
search
engine
do
you
run
into
problem
the
web
isn
t
like
scientific
literature
because
anybody
can
produce
web
page
one
way
to
think
of
pagerank
he
explain
be
it
s
a
usage
model
you
have
a
random
web
surfer
it
s
kind
of
like
a
monkey
just
somebody
who
sits
around
and
click
link
all
day
and
doesn
t
have
any
intelligence
you
could
argue
that
this
kind
of
approximates
people
s
behavior
on
the
web
page
pause
the
audience
chuckle
and
he
go
on
pagerank
be
basically
say
if
somebody
point
to
you
you
get
some
fraction
of
the
importance
that
they
have
let
s
say
somebody
really
important
point
to
you
that
s
worth
more
than
someone
who
have
a
random
web
page
for
example
if
yahoo
point
to
you
from
their
homepage
that
s
a
big
deal
if
you
just
have
one
link
on
the
yahoo
homepage
that
s
pretty
good
either
you
have
to
pay
someone
a
lot
of
money
or
your
page
be
pretty
good
if
you
have
a
link
on
my
homepage
nobody
would
pretty
much
care
page
then
explain
how
he
derive
his
recipe
for
produce
ranked
search
result
we
ve
assign
number
to
those
page
to
correspond
roughly
to
their
importance
the
page
s
rank
be
the
sum
of
all
thing
point
to
it
another
major
challenge
for
search
engine
page
say
be
that
people
try
to
trick
them
so
that
their
web
site
get
a
high
rank
in
the
list
of
result
the
search
engine
have
to
win
the
cyber
war
by
be

many
time
have
people
see
porn
result
thrown
in
with
other
random
thing
raise
your
hand
okay
we
have
a
few
who
admit
to
it
it
be
a
big
problem
for
search
engine
people
try
to
make
money
basically
by
get
their

list
for
every

they
don

care
what
you
re

for
they
don
t
care
about
anything
they
just
want
traffic
on
their

it
be
a
very
serious
problem
have
identify
the

page
explain
that
he
be
well
on
his
way
to
devise
the
solution
the
answer
he
say
would
involve
a
dynamic
and
ever
change
way
of
measure
the
true
importance
of

that
would
make
it
harder
for

operator
to

the

with
total
focus
on
the
end
user

at

take

at

if

will
you
get
the

homepage
maybe
not
that
s
something
we
do
a
really
good
job
at
we
do
all
this
stuff
ourselves
it
be
a
fairly
major
undertaking
the
key
to
google
s
approach
be
break
down
complex
task
into
small
chunk
that
could
be
handle
simultaneously
use
the
right
mathematical
equation
and
multiple
personal
computer
brin
and
page
could
create
a
modern
assembly
line
to
process
the
gathering
index
and
present
of

and
take
advantage

law
too
assure
them
more
compute
power
for
less
cost
we
crawl
the

which

we
go
out
and
download
the
entire
web
we
download
roughly
page
per
second
page
say
this
be
fairly
complicate
to
do
reliably
we
actually
store
all
the
web
page
we
download
because
it
s
very
good
for
research
we
have
the

on

across
the

it
promise
to
be
very
useful
for

around

more
about

on

whenever
you

we

use
a
more

approach
and
fail
to
keep

with
the

with

you

technical
he

it

they

the

the

date
her

brin

could
have
rent
the
space
for
a
month
but
they
chose
instead
to
pay
so
that
all
fee
and
tax
would
be
paid
and
everything
would
be
do
properly
from
the
start
on
september
they
formally
establish
the
company
google
inc
they
then
open
their
first
bank
account
and
deposit
bechtolsheim

they
also
hire
a
friend
craig
silverstein
a
fellow
stanford
ph
d
student
as
their
first
employee
we
found
a
place
with
some
extra
space
and
move
in
and
work
in
a
garage
like
a
good
silicon
valley
start
up
should
do
silverstein
say
wojcicki
though
be
in
for
a
bit
of
a
surprise
since
she
thought
the
guy
in
the
garage
would
only
be
there
when
she
be
not
we
thought
well
they
ll
probably
just
be
there
during
the
day
while
we
re
at
work
we
won
t
notice
wojcicki
say
but
they
be
actually
there
hour
a
day
all
the
time
but
in
the
end
it
work
out
well
and
we
get
free
internet
access
at
the
same
time
after
five
month
brin
and
page
outgrew
wojcicki
s
garage
so
in
early
they
move
into
office
on
university
avenue
in
downtown
palo
alto
it
would
be
the
first
of
several
change
of
venue
that
would
serve
as
marker
of
the
company
s
emerge
culture
and
growth
they
want
work
to
be
fascinate
and
fun
and
be
determine
to
keep
it
that
way
the
second
floor
space
in
the
heart
of
a
posh
college
town
be
a
perfect
place
to
be
barely
a
mile
from
the
stanford
campus
and
much
livelier
than
an
office
park
neither
of
the
guy
have
a
clear
idea
of
how
the
company
would
make
money
though
it
seem
to
them
that
if
they
have
the
best
search

others
would
want
to
use
it
in
their

most
of
all
they
share
an
abide
excitement
about
help
people
find
more
relevant
information
online
and
faster
that
remain
their
primary
motivation
we
start
this
company
because
we
be
unhappy
with
current

if
we
be
successful
that
will
just

it

taught
the

a
lesson
about
the

the

they
have
raise
in

most
of
their

in

developed
an
extremely
popular
brand

soon
after

there
be
time
when

they
would
do
it
their

no

at
all
there
would
be
no
compromise
it
be
as
simple
as
that
in
the

both
john

of

an

about

idea
it
be

enough

figure
out
which

to
bet
on
when

be
flash
on
a

they
be
also
force
to
guess
which
of
the
dozen
of
new
concept
and
technology
they
be
see
would
catch
on
for

anything
that
doerr

have
ever
see
the
google

seem
super
bright
and
extremely
brash
they
knew
it
all
but
they
also
have
connection
stanford
pedigree
fire
in
their

that
these

whatever
it
take

the

question
revolve
around
how
to
value
a

that
have
no
real

model
associate
with
it

whether
any

the

approach
their

strategy
they
come
across

genuinely
nice
people
who

about

of

they

that

moritz

met

back
when

at

have
back
yahoo
with

gain
from

s
million
ipo
in
around
that
same
time
brin
and
page
be
gathering
information
about
start
a
company
include
valuation
method
and
other
technique
so
they
could
work
out
an
agreement
with
stanford
that
would
facilitate
the
patent
of
pagerank
and
enable
them
to
license
it
from
the
school
they
also
have
be
advise
that
meeting
some
venture
capitalist
early
before
they
need
money
be
a
good
idea
they
come
by
the
office
and
they
be
curious
about
how
to
start
a
company
but
it
be
fairly
quick
one
of
those
conversation
of
which
we
have
many
moritz
recall
i
didn
t
think
much
about
the
conversation
afterward
as
wore
on
and
google
begin
to
run
short
of
cash
one
of
its
angel
investor
a
silicon
valley
money
manager
name
ron
conway
contact
moritz
and
ask
him
to
meet
with
brin
and
page
ron
conway
ping
us
about
them
moritz
say
we
also
heard
about
them
through
the
yahoo
guy
as
well
this
be
the
spring
of
so
everything
be
do
in
a
pell
mell
rush
those
be
fairly
frenetic
circumstance
and
time
moritz
remembers
be
very
impressed
with
the
demonstration
of
the
google
search
engine
we
have
several
meeting
at
sequoia
and
down
in
palo
alto
where
they
have
a
little
office
on
the
main
drag
he
say
they
have
the
google
beta
site
run
so
it
be
reasonably
easy
to
detect
the
quality
of
the
difference
between
the
search
result
they
be
provide
and
what
others
be
provide
their
original
business
idea
have
nothing
to
do
with
advertising
it
be
aim
at
licensing
the
technology
to
a
variety
of
other
internet
company
and
enterprise
how
do
moritz
evaluate
their
potential
his
answer
offer
clue
as
to
how
one
of
silicon
valley
s
most
successful
venture
capitalist
make
decision
it
be
more
art
than
science
and
his
be
an
investor
in
yahoo
also
played
a
role
illustrate
how
multiple
set
of
relationship
can
influence
decision
make
that
might
otherwise
appear
linear
we
have
be
wrong
on
lot
of
occasion
moritz
explain
it
be
the
quality
of
the
service
that
google
provide
that
be
demonstrably
well
than
you
could
get
anywhere
else
that
be
why
we
invest
and
as
the
internet
developed
we
thought
search
would
be
more
important
not
less
important
these
two
larry
and
sergey
be
very
smart
people
we
have
some
benefit
from
be
around
the
evolution
of
the
internet
the
other
thing
that
happen
be
that
yahoo
have
have
licensing
relationship
with
a
considerable
number
of
search
vendor
they
have
relationship
with
open
text
with
altavista
and
with
inktomi
and
google
be
the
late
to
come
along
the
yahoo
people
be
very
interested
in
google
as
a
search
engine
to
power
their
service
he
say
and
they
also
be
interested
in
want
to
help
us
become
an
investor
in
the
company
because
they
thought
it
would
help
yahoo
moritz
say
sequoia
be
inclined
to
invest
in
google
in
part
to
assist
yahoo
for
us
to
help
ensure
that
yahoo
be
take
care
of
they
be
view
google
correctly
nobody
understood
in
how
thing
be
go
to
evolve
google
be
a
potential
vendor
to
yahoo
it
seem
to
us
that
the
internet
have
spawn
two
useful
application
one
be
email
and
the
second
be
search
they
have
built
a
well
search
trap
moritz
say
he
also
recognize
that
brin
and
page
together
have
the
right
stuff
he
have
see
over
and
over
again
how
start
up
company
found
by
pair
of
entrepreneur
who
share
a
common
vision
have
a
great
chance
for

at
apple
with
steve

and
steve
wozniak
it
have
happen
at
yahoo
and
maybe
just
maybe
it
could
happen
at
google
they
be
a
pair
of
unusually
smart
men
that
be
very
evident
in
our
business
we
meet
lot
and
lot
of
people
and
over
time
you
develop
a
sense
of
who
the
special
individual
be
partly
because
of
what
they
have
do
or
be
do
and
partly
because
of
the
way
they
express
themselves
they
have
a
great
sense
of
purpose
which
be
a
prerequisite
for
anyone
who
be
nutty
enough
to
want
to
start
a
company
that
burning
sense
of
conviction
be
what
you
need
to
overcome
the
inevitable
obstacle
while
moritz
focus
on
brin
page
and
the
search
engine
they
have
built
john
doerr

more
than
most

big
on
the

benefit
from

insist
that
the

much
great
than

on
the

for

the

such

would
bring
it
be
the
essential
ingredient
they

to
realize
their
dream
of
building
the
best

most
comprehensive
search
engine
on
the

an
investment
from
kleiner

lead
by
doerr
would
put
the
imprimatur
of

on
their
start
up
in
the
spring
of

both
decide
that
they

their

to

in
google
brin

found
themselves
exactly
where
they

with
a
vex
problem
the
two
venture
capitalist
refuse
to
invest
jointly
in
the
company
so
google
risk
lose
them
both
each
firm
want
to
call
the
shot
and
lay
claim
to
google
as
its
deal
each
be
too
big
in
its
own
right
to
cede
control
to
the
other
and
neither
need
the
deal
if
it
meant
be
a
minority
partner
that
wouldn
t
work
not
in
the
peck
order
of
silicon

both
kleiner
perkins

sequoia
control
too
much
money
to

ups
that
wasn
t
how
you
hit
home
run
in
the
venture
capital
business
at
least
not
at
the
most
prestigious
firm
on
sand
hill
road
it
be
a
dilemma
for
brin
and
page
on
one
hand
they
need
money
fast
and
have
two
firm
offering
it
on
the
other
maybe
they
could
raise
cash
without
give
up
control
if
they
could
persuade
both
firm
to
invest
it
be
a
big
if
but
that
be
the
route
they
decide
to
pursue
even
it
meant
lose
them
fortunately
for

two
of
their
early
angel

ron
conway

shriram
have

tamara
munzner

run
while
on

they
be
drawn
to
it
because
of
the
technical
and
creative
wildness

sean
anderson

strong
belief
about
what
make
for
productive
culture
community
and
ethic
in
their
young
company
and
the
rigidly

the
google

be
a
hit
with
user
who
want
more
soon
it
fell
to
a
committee
of

two
others
to
decide
which
holiday

in
the
early
go
they
paid
tribute
to

independence
day
but
these
always
make
someone
unhappy
religious
holiday
would
do
the
same
they
figure
so
they
steer
toward
politically
correct
holiday
and
event
like
chinese
new
year
earth
day
and
the

on

to

a
colleague
inform
mayer
that

some

there

always
a
few
computer

have
permanently
change
its

when
hwang

though
this
process
consist
of
seemingly
inconsequential
thing
like
tweak
text
size
and

it
be
critical
to
how

whether
they
would
return

have
put
a
premium
on

in
every

those

that
the

of

her
colleague
figure
out
it
refer
to
the
number
of

on
the

the

that

how
they
cobble

from
cheap

rather
than

several

spent
google
have
three

they

dr

the

rather

on

this
be
a
money

for

but
as

soar
some
of
the

go
bankrupt

twice
that
number
by
the
follow
summer
with
this
sort
of
expansion
it
be
imperative
that
google
build
redundancy
into
the

so
that
if
one
cluster
of
computer
go
down
or
be
completely
lose
in
an
earthquake
other

would
have

to
pick
up
the
slack
at
the
time
google
have
two
data

in
northern
california
and
a
third
in
the
washington
dc
area
later
add
many
more
across
the
u
s
and
overseas
the
value
of
have
multiple
copy
of
everything
become
clear
when
a
fire
broke
out
in
one
of

larry

this

everyone
it

want
to
be
a
part
of
it
sullivan
say
ironically
the
turn
point
for
him
come
one
day
not
long
after
he
have
make
the
leap
when
an
angry
customer
whose
web
site
list
available
job
in
orange
county
become
furious
with

his

partner
because
the
customer
s
internet
site
be
not
show
up
prominently
enough
in

result
the
rage
caught
sullivan
off

he
be
a
friendly
and
analytical
sort
and
he
wasn
t
use
to
be
chewed
out
moreover
he
couldn
t
understand
what
have
go
wrong
the
customer
s
fury
serve
as
a
catalyst
for
sullivan
send
him
on
a
mission
to
discover
how
search
engine
actually
gather
data
and
generate
ranking
and
result
for
the
next
several
month
sullivan
poked
around
the
web
ask
a
lot
of
question
and
grow
increasingly
fascinate
by
the
hidden
world
of
search
engine
among
other
thing
he
discover
that
the
automate
crawler
sent
out
by
altavista
and
its
top
competitor
to
scour
the
web
randomly
omit
certain
information
from
their
database
it
wasn
t
completely
clear
why
though
it
seem
likely
that
they
be
simply
not
able
to
keep
pace
with
the
growth
of
the
web
sullivan
now
realize
that
he
be
onto
something
big
he
have
found
a
subject
that
be
extremely
important
for
web
site
owner
to
understand
if
they
want
to
build
traffic
and
garner
attention
he
publish
a
study
a
webmaster
s
guide
to
search
engine
on
the
internet
and
explain
that
search
engine
marketing
be
tricky
business
even
though
there
be
numerous
search
engine
they
remain
primitive
in
many
way
copying
the
web
slowly
and
routinely
leave
out
important
data
while
it
be
a
good
idea
for
site
owner
to
try
to
improve
their
ranking
on
all
the
engine
there
be
too
many
of
them
come
at
the
problem
in
too
many
different
way
to
connect
with
them
all
so
instead
of
a
mass
market
approach
sullivan
suggest
in
his
study
that
web
publisher
focus
on
altavista
excite
and
a
few
other
lead
engine
it
be
sound
advice
by
the
time
sullivan
s
report
be
online
however
the
company
he
have
go
to
work
for
have
go
bust
nevertheless
sullivan
be
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
he
receive
a
lot
of
positive
response
to
his
study
and
go
into
business
himself
become
an
internet
consultant
with
a
web
site
he
name
califia
com
convince
that
the
internet
enable
him
to
consult
from
anywhere
he
and
his
wife
a
native
of
great
britain
move
from
california
to
london
in
so
they
could
be
closer
to
her
family
he
also
begin
publishing
a
regular
online
newsletter
call
search
engine
watch
base
on
the
strong
reaction
to
his
initial
study
and
the
dialogue
spark
by
occasional
update
to
his
web
site
sullivan
sense
that
the
internet
be
a
place
where
a
single
individual
with
expertise
in
a
particular
area
could
make
a
living
by
publishing
a
newsletter
online
unlike
traditional
newsletter
his
online
publication
have
no
cost
of
distribution
and
he
could
instantly
post
up
to
the
minute
news
or
insight
about
the
evolve
search

industry
its

grow

in

he
retain
the

site
s
name
and
his
identity
as
the
guru
of

and
he
soon
add
the

his

as
he
tour
several
major
city

sullivan
knew
it
be
important
for
him
to
visit
silicon

from
time
to
time
so
he
could
stay
in
touch
with
fresh

there
and
meet
the
new
player
emerge
in
search
aware
of

when
it
launch
in
he
wonder
whether
the

for

people
laugh

google

be
not
impressed
the
original
business
idea
be
aim
at
licensing
the
underlie

technology
to
a
variety
of
other
internet
company
and
enterprise
say
sequoia
s
michael
moritz
during
the
first
year
we
collectively
have
concern
that
the
market
we
be
pursue
be
more
difficult
and
more
intractable
than
we
have
originally
anticipate
the
conversation
with
potential
customer
and
negotiation
with
potential
customer
be
protract
moritz
go
on
there
be
a
fair
amount
of
competition
and
we
didn
t
have
a
direct
sale
force
the
customer
be
very
harsh
on
the
price
they
be
prepared
to
pay
it
be
clear
if
we
be
go
to
pursue
that
path
it
be
go
to
be
a
brutal
path
brin

not
discourage
they
knew
they
have
a
well
search
engine
and
they
sought
to
forge
a
relationship
with
danny
sullivan
so
he
could
help
them
spread
the
word
globally
without
their
have
to
spend
money
on
advertising
it
work
positive
mention
on
sullivan
s
web
site
and
the
email
that
follow
serve
as
one
of
the
important
way
google
market
itself
without
advertising
it
be
a
symbiotic
relationship
that
would
work
for
the
entrepreneur
for
google
and
for
danny
sullivan
too
although
google
be
average
seven
million

per

by
the
end
of
its

from

deal
remain
small
while
brin

didn
t
care
about
get
rich
they
didn
t
want
google
to
flounder
if
the
business
could
not
sustain
itself
they
would
not
be
able
to
fulfill
their
vision
of
make
all
of
the
world
s
information
easily
available
to
user
without
charge
the
two
of
them
wonder
how
best
to
navigate
this
maze
anything
that
compromise
the
relationship
of
trust
they
have
with
their

would
be
unacceptable
to
them
even
if
it
generate
a
lot
of
money
for
google
they
felt
conflict
about
advertising
and
have
include
a
strongly
word
statement
on
the
subject
in
a
paper
they
publish
about
google
technology
ad
fund
search
engine
be
inherently
bias
towards
the

they
write
suggest
that
the
well
the

be
the

be
need
for
the
consumer
to
find
what
they

at
the

advertising
be
a
type
of
information
that
some
user
might
want
perhaps
not
all
ad
would
violate
the
don

evil
motto
that

begin

immediately
found
aspect
of

distasteful
among
other
thing
it
would

that

for
it
the
google

have
two
choice
they
could
hire
overture
to
sell
ad
to
display
alongside
search
result
on
google
com
or
they
could
try
to
sell
advertising
themselves
the
decision
be
not
difficult
google
write
all
its
own
software
and
built
all
its
own
computer
if
sergey
and
larry
believe
in
anything
it
be
their
own
ability
to
get
thing
do
if
they
could
conquer
the
sophisticated
venture
capitalist
on
sand
hill
road
why
couldn
t
they
sell
ad
themselves
and
keep
cent
of
every
dollar
rather
than
share
the
proceeds
with
overture
do
it
themselves
would
also
give
them
total
control
enable
them
to
avoid
potentially
dangerous
conflict
and
any
perception
that
might
damage
google
s
stature
as
a
trust
brand
name
so
the
two
decide
to
try
to
emulate
aspect
of
what
overture
have
start
in
on
the
ad
side
with
some
tweak
the
newly
emerge
business
strategy
be
simple
continue
to
produce
free
search
result
and
profit
by
sell

the
key
be
to
make
it
clear
they
wouldn
t
bias
the
search
result
the
thing
that
always
come
across
loud
and
clear
be
their
dedication
and
seriousness
about
want
to
do
the
right
thing
sullivan

talk
to
many
people
before
embark
on
the
path
toward
ad
to
ensure
that
they
didn
t
make
any
mistake
they
become
persuade
that
just
as
there
be
a
clear
distinction
between
news
story
and
ad
in
newspaper
they
could
achieve
the
same
thing
on

but
they
hat
to
clutter
the
clean
interface
that
have
be
its
call
card
from
the
start
so
they
kept
the
homepage
free
of

and
they
developed
strict
standard
for
the
size
and
type
of

they
would
display
elsewhere
they
decide
also
to
have
a
bright
line
on
the

that
separate
the
free

from
the

they

that
way
nobody
could
argue
that
the

result
be
combine
with
the

yet
the
ad
would
be
clicked
on
more
often
under

than
if
they

they

the

in
a
clearly
marked
box
above
the
free

result
they
want
the

to

a
good

so
there
would
be
no

that
would
interfere
with

the

mostly
to
large
business
that

afford
hefty
ad
campaign
but
by
utilize
their
own
technology
they
soon
move
to
a
model
that
enable

to
sign
up
easily
online
themselves
this
cut
cost
brought
midsize
business
into
the
fold
and
give

an
edge
over
similar

lag

to

pretty

an

danny
sullivan
salute
google
s
approach
on
his
web

an
important
vote
of
confidence
that
sergey
and
larry
take
very
seriously
the
difference
be
that
they
understood
you
have
to
separate
the
editorial
result
from
the
paid
result
sullivan
say
and
they
always
separate
them
as
the
month
pass
brin
and
page
have
another
breakthrough
idea
rank
ad
base
on
relevance
as
they
do
their

instead
of

an

from
the
vendor
willing

ranked
its

base

a
formula
that
take
into

both
how

someone
offer
to
pay
and
how
frequently
computer

to
the

downward
brin
and
page
reason
that
the
ad
clicked
on
the
most
frequently
be
the
most
relevant
in
other
word
they
trust
their
user
to
rank
the

it
be
consumer
pull
rather
than
business
push
that

make
sure
you
show
the
most

ad
be
a
nice
public
relation
kind
of
thing
sullivan
say
you
can
go
out
and
say
our
ad
be
more
relevant
because
people
be
click
on
them
sullivan
also
point
out
that
google
would
profit
more
by
put
the
most
popular
ad
high
on
the
list
where
they
would
be
see
and
clicked
on
by
even
more
people
this
approach
to
advertising
be
homegrown
at
google
he
say
google
have
not
be
first
in
search
but
they
have
come
up
with
a
way
to
produce
superior
result
they
have
not
be
first
in
search
advertising
but
they
have
do
it
cleverly
and
they
argue
with
more
integrity
than
overture
and
sullivan
be
on
their
side
note
that
the
decision
to
rank
ad
in
this
way
be
well
for
all
side
still
brin
and
page
felt
that
their

engine
be
at
risk
google
have
a
grow
brand
name
and
million
of
computer
user
turn
to
it
for

daily
but
it
have
no
customer
lock

what
if
someone

come
up

they
have
to
remain
focus
on
improve

through
innovation
google
s
result
be
well
than
those
generate
elsewhere
but
they
do
not
always
answer
the
question
on
the
user
s
mind
the
great
thing
about
search
be
that
we
be
not
go
to
solve
it
any
time
soon
page
say
in
early
there
be
so
many
problem
and
failing
i
see
no
end
to
what
we
need
to
do
if
we
aren
t
a
lot
well
next
year
we
will
already
be

google
s
superior
search
deliver
a
big
enough
audience
for
business
to
target
their
advertising
but
how
well
it
would
all
work
remain
to
be
see
by
the
middle
of

of

would
they

enable

to

and
google
to
sustain
its
financial
model
brin
and
page
remain
confident
but
skepticism
abound
about
the
company
s
ability
to
make
it
as
a
business
that
give

away
for

and
refuse
to
accept
both
banner

in
december
of

ran
a
story
under

will
google

purity
pay
off
in
it
people
wonder
aloud
whether
google
could
survive
by
focus
on
search
and
user
more
than
on
money
there
isn
t
really
good
evidence
frankly
that
company
focus
purely
on
search
as
google
have
be
can
support
themselves
with
that
model

the

the

take
note
brin

have
found
a
way
to

without

from

maybe
he
be
worried
about
get
his
investment
back

hop
schmidt
could
ride
to
the
rescue
and
do
some
damage

any
event
eric
schmidt
reluctantly
walk
into
the
room
ready
at
last
to
meet
the
young
entrepreneur
fulfill
an
obligation
to
doerr
and
then
get
back
to
work
at
novell
sergey
and
larry
have
as
little
interest
in
meeting
schmidt
as
he
have
in
meeting
them
he
be
no
more
than
the
late
in
a
series
of
technology
chieftain
that
they
would
be
oblige
to
waste
their

appease
doerr

moritz
their

to
send
schmidt
on
his
way
back
to
wherever
he
have
come
from
just
as
they
have
everyone
else
the
truth
be
they
still
didn
t
want
anybody
look
over
their
shoulder
at
google
and
the
last
thing
they
need
or
want
be
a
bean
counter
put
corporate
type
control
in
place
could
only
hurt
stifle
innovation
hamper
progress
and
lead
to
alarm
report
back
to
kleiner
perkins
and
sequoia
capital
about
how
they
be
waste
money
some
senior
executive
from
the
world
of
business
and
technology
would
never
be
able
to
understand
the
culture
of
the
enterprise
they
have
create
since
it
be
more
like
a
graduate
school
program
on
a
university
campus
than
a
business
on
its
way
to
an
initial
public
offering
the
coin
of
the
realm
for
venture
capitalist
look
to
cash
in
sergey
and
larry
take
pride
in
their
independence
the
two
venture
firm
that
have
invest
million
in
google
have
gotten
nothing
in
return
thus
far
except
frustration
headache
and
sporadic
update
from
the
pair
who
have
do
everything
possible
to
maintain
absolute
control
but
the
firm
be
insistent
that
they
hire
someone
more
experienced
and
old
than
them
someone
who
knew
how
to
run
a
company
and
could
be
its
public
face
when
it
come
time
to
cash
in
on
wall
street
the
guy
be
fully
aware
of
what
be
go
on
they
have
played
one
firm
against
the
other
as
masterfully
as
a
skilled
poker
player
bidding
and
bluffing
his
way
to
capture
the
chip
regardless
of
whether
he
be
hold
the
best
or
bad
hand
at
the
table
sergey
a
student
of
human
nature
and
larry
who
have
the
benefit
of
learn
from
his
old
brother
carl
s
experience
knew
that
the
most
painful
experience
a
venture
investor
could
have
be
passing
on
a
potential
investment
that
turn
out
to
be
a
blockbuster
that
be
one
of
the
thing
that
kept
wealthy
men
in
the
game
eric
schmidt
didn
t
know
it
when
he
walk
in
to
meet
with
brin
and
page
but
john
doerr
have
be
look
for
the
right
person
to
bring
in
as
ceo
of
the
search
engine
for
frustrate
month
while
brin
and
page
have
make
a
commitment
to
hire
someone
they
approve
of
as
chief
executive
officer
doerr
be
begin
to
feel
that
nobody
he
identify
would
be
good
enough
to
please
them
the
person
would
need
the
right
combination
of
personality
and
smart
to
meet
their
high
standard
and
be
willing
to
check
his
ego
at
the
door
they
have
reject
one
candidate
after
another
as
brin
and
page
saw
it
they
would
remain
in
charge
of
google
not
some
new
ceo
hire
from
the
outside
and
force
on
them
by
doerr
from
their
perspective
everything
be
fine
at
google
they
have
do
their
best
to
discourage
many
candidate
doerr
sent
along
from
want
to
come
to
work
with
the
two
of
them
the
room
that
schmidt
walk
into
where
sergey
and
larry
have
food
on
a
tray
and
his
background
project
on
the
wall
be
in
the
old
sun
microsystems
building
in
mountain
view
schmidt
be
a
former
chief
technology
officer
of
sun
but
he
have
long
since
move
on
to
tackle
new
challenge
at
novell
now
almost
as
soon
as
he
sat
down
sergey
laid
into
him
about
what
he
term
the
stupidity
of
the
strategy
schmidt
be
execute
at
novell
i
argue
back
hard
schmidt
recall
we
argue
for
at
least
minute
back
and
forth
they
go
debate
disagree
and
intellectually
duel
by
the
time
he
walk
out
schmidt
who
previously
have
laid
the
groundwork
to
leave
novell
over
a
period
of
month
have
two
thought
about
their
discourse
it
be
the
best
argument
he
have
have
in
a
very
long
time
and
he
sense
he
would
end
up
involve
with
google
in
some
way
for
their
part
brin
and
page
like
schmidt
well
than
the
other
candidate
they
have
met
they
be
under
increase
pressure
to
bring
someone
in
who
could
handle
the
internal
management
side
of
the
company
at
one
point
moritz
have
threaten
to
demand
repayment
of
sequoia
capital
s
million
investment
if
they
do
not
fulfill
their
verbal
pledge
to
hire
a
first
rate
chief
executive
officer
it
have
be
a
heat
exchange
but
it
didn
t
motivate
the
google
guy
who
dismiss
the
threat
to
moritz
it
felt
as
if
they
be
resist
his
directive
like
a
pair
of
adolescent
challenge
parental
authority
if
larry
and
sergey
be
give
instruction
by
a
divine
presence
they
would
still
have
question
he
say
recognize
the
magnitude
of
the
challenge
doerr
decide
to
take
a
different
approach
he
arrange
a
series
of
meeting
for
brin
and
page
with
heavyweight
in
the
world
of
technology
whom
they
respect
include
intel
chairman
andy
grove
doerr
hop
that
over
time
these
meeting
would
persuade
the
independent
mind
entrepreneur
that
they
would
do
well
and
be
happier
in
the
long
run
as
google
grow
if
they
focus
on
intrigue
problem
and
left
the
mundane
task
of
run
a
business
day
to
day
to
somebody
else
it
seem
well
than
try
to
persuade
them
to
honor
a
verbal
pledge
they
have
never
consider
important
in
the
first
place
but
it
wasn
t
clear
to
doerr
how
well
his
strategy
be
work
after
the
guy
have
a
conversation
with
jeff
bezos
accord
to
an
article
in
gq
magazine
the
amazon
ceo
told
doerr
some
people
just
want
to
paddle
across
the
atlantic
ocean
in
a
rubber
raft
that
s
fine
for
them
the
question
be
whether
you
want
to
put
up
with
it
still
doerr
be
optimistic
that
brin
and
page
would
eventually
come
around
and
he
sense
that
schmidt
have
the
right
blend
of
personality
and
background
one
thing
the
pair
do
like
about
schmidt
be
that
he
not
only
have
experience
as
a
ceo
but
be
also
a
computer
scientist
like
the
best
people
they
hire
at
google
schmidt
have
academic
credential
and
a
scientist
s
love
of
research
he
held
a
ph
d
in
computer
science
from
the
university
of
california
at
berkeley
and
have
earn
an
undergraduate
degree
in
electrical
engineering
from
princeton
he
have
do
research
at
the
xerox
palo
alto
research
center
know
by
the
acronym
parc
as
well
as
at
bell
lab
he
wasn
t
afraid
to
speak
his
mind
and
wasn
t
intimidate
at
their
first
meeting
he
have
also
be
to
burning
man
in
short
schmidt
have
pass
their
litmus
test
schmidt
also
have
something
else
others
might
view
as
a
weakness
but
brin
and
page
saw
as
a
strength
he
have
fail
at
something
while
at
sun
microsystems
he
have
challenged
microsoft
by
lead
the
development
of
java
an
independent
program
language
and
he
have
define
the
company
s
internet
strategy
although
the
effort
prove
largely
unsuccessful
it
show
that
schmidt
be
not
afraid
to
take
on
bill
gate
and
microsoft
s
computer
base
operating
system
with
software
that
give
business
and
people
a
choice
rather
than
have
a
system
force
upon
them
this
take
a
certain
independence
that
brin
and
page
admire
and
it
also
meant
that
schmidt
recognize
what
sun
have
do
wrong
in
challenge
microsoft
s
dominance
for
the
google
guy
the
advantage
there
be
that
rather
than
make
mistake
themselves
as
they
built
an
internet
base
software
alternative
they
could
learn
from
the
strategic
and
tactical
error
that
schmidt
and
sun
have
make
their
initial
meeting
end
inconclusively
but
a
courtship
have
begin
sergey
and
larry
like
schmidt
as
well
as
they
be
go
to
like
anyone
in
the
role
of
google
ceo
but
one
thing
be
certain
they
have
no
intention
of
lavish
him
with
cheap
stock
option
that
would
someday
be
worth
big
money
without
extract
a
hefty
commitment
they
want
proof
that
he
too
be
emotionally
and
financially
invest
in
the
company
that
they
have
found
and
built
sergey
and
larry
call
him
to
talk
thing
over
what
would
you
like
to
do
the
google
guy
ask
schmidt
i
be
busy
sell
a
company
schmidt
remind
them
he
have
no
intention
of
walk
out
at
a
moment
when
he
be
try
to
guide
novell
through
the
sale
process
i
be
happy
to
be
chairman
of
google
he
then
say
since
this
would
not
entail
day
to
day
responsibility
and
be
ceo
at
some
point
in
the
future
we
don
t
need
you
now
larry
told
him
but
we
think
we
re
go
to
need
you
in
the
future
i
agree
that
as
the
company
grows
my
experience
would
be
helpful
eric
reply
the
party
hung
up
and
take
a
deep
breath
behind
the
scene
doerr
push
both
side
to
find
a
way
to
make
this
work
he
sense
it
be
the
right
match
john
s
role
be
fundamental
schmidt
say
when
you
look
at
google
from
the
outside
it
look
like
larry
and
sergey
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
smart
people
mike
moritz
and
john
brought
gravitas
to
the
effort
that
should
not
be
trivialize
next
come
serious
negotiation
over
schmidt
s
compensation
package
larry
and
sergey
be
insistent
that
he
invest
some
of
his
own
money
in
the
company
he
be
equally
insistent
that
if
he
be
go
to
become
chairman
first
and
then
chief
executive
officer
he
have
to
have
the
opportunity
for
plenty
of
upside
in
the
form
of
stock
option
the
currency
of
choice
in
silicon
valley
schmidt
knew
the
company
be
cash
poor
and
idea
rich
so
he
didn
t
push
for
a
big
annual
pay
package
he
would
make
plenty
of
money
from
sell
novell
but
by
ignore
the
prevail
wisdom
about
search
to
go
work
for
google
he
be
put
something
far
more
valuable
on
the
line
his
reputation
they
go
round
and
round
over
stock
option
which
larry
and
sergey
have
doled
out
generously
to
their
friend
from
stanford
and
elsewhere
who
have
come
to
work
with
them
back
when
the
idea
seem
even
riskier
but
if
schmidt
be
go
to
take
the
job
as
chairman
and
then
ceo
he
want
option
that
could
be
convert
into
million
of
share
of
stock
make
him
the
big
employee
shareholder
two
thing
help
bring
the
deal
in
for
a
land
first
schmidt
show
his
commitment
by
agree
to
pay
million
of
his
own
money
to
buy
prefer
stock
in
google
he
do
so
at
a
time
in
early
when
the
company
be
run
short
of
cash
so
the
money
truly
serve
a
business
purpose
second
brin
and
page
recognize
that
john
doerr
have
some
leverage
over
them
more
than
a
year
have
pass
since
he
and
moritz
have
invest
the
million
in
google
so
they
could
say
that
the
pair
have
breach
their
promise
to
hire
a
chief
executive
officer
the
venture
firm
could
now
demand
their
initial
investment
back
which
google
could
not
afford
either
financially
or
in
term
of
its
reputation
schmidt
reach
an
agreement
with
brin
and
page
in
january
and
the
deal
be
sign
two
month
later
in
march
after
all
the
financial
and
legal
term
have
be
finalize
from
march
until
july
schmidt
serve
simultaneously
as
chairman
of
google
s
board
and
ceo
of
novell
spending
some
time
at
google
on
top
of
his
day
job
at
novell
you
can
t
be
ceo
and
not
show
up
schmidt
point
out
in
the
second
week
of
july
when
the
novell

he
be

i
be
also
an
investor
of
real
money
schmidt
recall
the
company
literally
need
the
cash
and
they
want
to
see
a
real
commitment
schmidt
arrive
at
google
to
find
a
technology
firm
that
nearly
three
year
after
its
found
be
be
run
by
technologist
who
put
enormous
time
into
people
and
product
and
user
but
spent
as
little
money
and
time
as
possible
on
the
detail
of
internal
management
he
move
into
an
eight
by
twelve
foot
office
near
the
pair
who
share
a
large
office
full
of
people
and
toy
and
computer
equipment
and
other
random
item
the
place
be
always
a
zoo
schmidt
say
he
knew
what
he
need
to
do
but
he
also
have
to
persuade
sergey
and
larry
to
accept
the
necessity
of
building
a
business
infrastructure
for
instance
the
financial
record
keep
and
payroll
system
be
be
run
use
off
the
shelf
software
from
quicken
the
kind
people
use
to
do
their
own
income
tax
or
operate
a
very
small
enterprise
that
be
fine
for
a
start
up
but
not
for
this
company
with
employee
and
million
in
revenue
say
schmidt
this
turn
into
a
define
battle
schmidt
want
to
bring
in
a
major
business
and
financial
record
keep
system
from
oracle
that
be
his
job
but
larry
and
sergey
thought
it
be
a
bad
idea
a
complete
waste
of
money
eric
found
himself
challenged
on
do
the
basic
task
he
have
be
brought
in
to
accomplish
that
be
a
huge
fight
schmidt
recall
they
couldn
t
imagine
why
it
make
sense
to
pay
all
that
money
to
oracle
when
quicken
be
available
despite
conflict
like
this
schmidt
have
the
right
sensibility
and
touch
with
larry
and
sergey
he
knew
when
to
push
he
knew
when
to
back
off
and
he
knew
when
to
make
light
of
their
difference
the
more
time
he
spent
at
google
the
more
impressed
he
become
with
the
culture
they
have
create
and
the
clarity
and
sense
of
share
mission
that
pervade
the
company
they
have
a
broad
vision
his
job
be
to
put
that
vision
into
a
framework
that
would
give
it
the
best
chance
to
produce
tangible
financial
result
the
underlie
structure
and
strategy
and
culture
be
good
schmidt
say
the
most
apt
description
of
what
i
do
in
the
first
year
or
two
be
put
a
business
and
management
structure
around
the
vision
and
gem
that
larry
and
sergey
have
create
this
sound
simple
enough
but
it
wasn
t
easy
to
achieve
since
schmidt
didn
t
want
to
do
anything
that
would
alter
the
company
s
dna
or
destroy
his
relationship
with
larry
and
sergey
for
schmidt
an
engineer
a
business
executive
and
an
avid
pilot
it
often
felt
like
try
to
rebuild
an
airplane
in
mid
flight
without
touch
down
long
enough
to
refuel
eventually
however
the
trio
with
the
help
of
an
outsider
intuit
ceo
bill
campbell
whom
doerr
brought
in
to
guide
them
come
to
function
more
as
a
team
schmidt
learn
which
battle
to
fight
when
to
look
the
other
way
and
how
to
forge
trust
and
implement
some
natural
division
of
labor
so
that
decision
get
make
as
it
turn
out
sergey
be
a
gift
deal
maker
larry
be
the
deepest
technologist
of
the
three
and
eric
focus
on
the
detail
of
run
a
business
still
brin
and

like
to
kid
around
the
guy
unleashed
a
series
of
practical
joke
to
test
schmidt
s
mettle
disrupt
his
momentum
undermine
his
authority
and
make
sure
he
understood
his
place
in
the
peck
order
when
i
get
here
schmidt
say
the
company
have
credit

that
didn
t
get
bill
to
individual
larry
and
sergey
just
give

out
the
first
thing
i
do
be
cancel
all
the
credit
card
except
one
which
larry
and
sergey
control
they
give
their
card
to
other
people
to
use
to
buy
stuff
just
to
spite
me
one
day
a
telephone
booth
show
up
in
my
office
i
say
who
bought
the
telephone
booth
we
tracked
it
down
to
somebody
who

it
be
very
entertain
one
day
these
massage

up
who
bought
em
i
don
t
know
a
little
bit
of
mischief
go
a
long
way
as
google
grow
it
become
clear
that
john
doerr
s
role
in
encourage
page
and
brin
to
hire
schmidt
matter
more
and
more
so
do
his
insistence
that
bill
campbell
spend
time
advise
the
trio
as
an
outside
consultant
and
coach
he
help
them
function
well
together
the
google

be
receive
much
more
than
money
from
doerr
and
his
firm
they
be
get
the
guidance
they
need
to
operate
a
grow
privately
held
business
in
a
professional
manner
while
retain
the
sense
of
innovation
and
entrepreneurship
they
held
dear
and
at
last
they
be
accept
the
unorthodox
hierarchy
of
have
a
trio
at
the
top
in
that
trio
even
though
he
held
the
rank
title
of

it
clear
for
the
first
time
that
its

as
a

which

that
connect
more

partnership
the
company
could
have
enter
into
during
that
period
it
come
about
in

because
sergey

and
provide
them
with

and
most
reliable

the
only
way
to
get
aol
to
switch
it

fought
negotiation
be
to
provide

with
a
very
large
financial
guarantee
run
to
many
million
of

in

so
large
that

discuss
the
possibility
of
do
a
special
private
round
of
financing
to
ensure
that
the

while
berkowitz

more
on
the

than
the

he
first
set
about

how
a

could
have
stumble
what
sort

important
how
it

in
with
a

for
how
to

typical
of

berkowitz
say
but
he
remain
a
believer
in
the
power
of

and
he
recognize
that
unlike
other

engine
and

site
it
have
a
character
jeeves
who
brought
the

the
result
be
that
even
after
the
crash
ask
jeeves
have
a
strong
image
and
a
curiously
loyal
group
of

for
a

that
didn
t
measure
up
the
executive
search
firm
that
recruit
berkowitz
to
ask

present
him
as
a
candidate
who
understood
something
about
the
internet
content
delivery
and
run
a
public
company
however
he
knew
virtually
nothing
about

so
he
spent
the
first
several
month
on
the
job
in
ask
question
and
listen
to
people
the

he
say
after
learn
a
bit
more
he
make
a
decision
about
personnel
that
would
prove
instrumental
in
revive
the
business
he
replace
virtually
all
of
the
company
s
senior
management
but
he
do
so
carefully
one
area
at
a
time
i
want
to
make
sure
i
knew
how
to
fix
it
before

berkowitz
come
to
regard
search
as
a
distinct
product
that
could
have
its
own
brand
identity
one
of
his
new
hire
jim
lanzone
recognize
that
ask
jeeves
have
start
out
as
a
question
and
answer
service
which
involve
a
great
deal
of
manual
labor
in
contrast
google
have
an
automate
system
build
around
its
pagerank
formula
that
could
produce
faster
more
relevant
result
lanzone
set
out
to
find
a
distinctive
way
for
ask
jeeves
to
emulate
the
google
model
which
be
more
technology
driven
at
the
time
he
join
the
firm
in
august
lanzone
recall
although
ask
jeeves
have
a
pretty
poor
reputation
it
remain
a
top
web
site
how
could
this
be
possible
the
answer
lanzone
realize
be
that
many
people
who
have
frustrate
experience
on
ask
jeeves
kept
come
back
hop
thing
would
improve
neither
berkowitz
nor
lanzone
take
the
million
to
million
visitor
to
the
web
site
for
grant
in
fact
they
marvel
at
the
power
of
the
brand
work
together
the
two
men
come
to
the
conclusion
that
what
ask
jeeves
need
to
do
be
buy
technology
that
could
deliver
answer
to
people
s
query
help
the
firm
retain
its
user
base
and
then
over
time
if
it
survive
grow
we
have
the
audience
our
strategy
be
to
improve
the
product
lanzone
say
by
that
point
wall
street
have
sour
on
ask
jeeves
so
much
that
the
company
actually
have
more
cash
than
its
total
stock
market
value
this
be
a
signal
that
wall
street
anticipate
it
would
burn
through
the
remainder
of
its
cash
and
eventually
go
out
of
business
berkowitz
and
lanzone
have
other
idea
and
they
set
about
the
country
look
for
acquisition
target
we
need
a
search
engine
lanzone
say
that
be
really
the
only
method
you
can
use
to
answer
billion
of
query
in
the
fall
of
ask
jeeves
set
its
sight
on
an
obscure
seven
person
firm
far
from
silicon
valley
in
piscataway
new
jersey
call
teoma
teoma
mean
expert
in
gaelic
though
its
name
be
chosen
by
a
greek
originally
fund
by
the
pentagon
and
start
by
some
rutgers
university
computer
science
professor
teoma
be
a
third
generation
search
technology
at
least
in
the
eye
of
berkowitz
and
lanzone
as
they
saw
it
generation
one
be
altavista
generation
two
be
google
and
generation
three
be
teoma
or
what
ask
jeeves
come
to
refer
to
as
expert
rank
teoma
s
technology
involve
mathematical
formula
and
calculation
that
go
beyond
google
s
pagerank
system
which
be
base
on
popularity
in
fact
the
concept
have
be
cite
in
the
original
stanford
university
paper
write
by
sergey
brin

of
the

that

in
response
to

request
they
call
their
method
global
popularity
and
they
call
this
method
local
popularity
meaning
you
look
more
granularly
at
the

and
see
who
the
authoritative
source
be
lanzone
say
he
say
brin
and
page
have
conclude
that
local
popularity
would
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
execute
well
because
either
it
would
require
too
much
processing
power
to
do
it
in
real
time
or
it
would
take
too
long
at
rutgers
a
year
old
greek
computer
scientist
name
apostolos
gerasoulis
know
for
his
brilliance
and
for
wear
the
same
t

several
day
in
a
row
have
found
a
way
to
make
the
teoma
concept
work
and
do
local
popularity
search
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
but
for
berkowitz
persuade
the
ask

board
of

to
spend
million
of
dollar
on
an
east

after
the

would
not
be

jeeves
be
still
not
profitable
cash
be
precious
and
the

be
litter
with
other
once
promising

that
turn
out
to
be
money
pit
during
a
series
of
board
meeting
in
the
summer
of

argue
that
it
be
more
important
for
ask
jeeves
to
buy

berkowitz
reason

would

over

some

it
would
be
smarter
to
license

developed
at
someone
else
s
expense
the
debate
take
place
against
a
rather
dire
backdrop
as
the
company
stock
drop
below

berkowitz
ultimately
prevail
raise
his

the

he
have
set
his

on
buying

this
be
a
bargain

at

to
more

of

berkowitz

it
be
capable
of
deliver
ad
to
ask
jeeves
user
that
be
relevant
to
search
result
an
add
benefit
he
held
a
series
of
meeting
with
google
official
to
explore
the
prospect
of
a
partnership
the
google
effort
be
lead
by
its
chief
executive
officer
eric
schmidt
and
its
head
of
global
sale
omid
kordestani
these
high
level
contact
indicate
that
the
stake
for
both
party
in
a
positive
outcome
be
immense
i
have
a
face
to
face
meeting
with
eric
say
berkowitz
and
he
say
how
much
he
want
this
business
and
how
our
business
base
be
different
from
theirs
in
a
fast
grow
market
he
say
it
be
well
to
work
together
to
grow
the
market
than
to
kill
competitor
and
shrink
the
market
google
also
allow
ask
jeeves
before
proceed
to
test
its
ad
delivery
system
on
a
pilot
basis
berkowitz
like
the
result
and
begin
to
view
google
as
a
partner
rather
than
as
the
enemy
but
the
negotiation
seem
endless
to
him
he
be
use
to
cut
deal
more
quickly
part
of
the
reason
be
that
larry
page
and
sergey
brin
have
to
sign
off
on
every
major
aspect
of
the
contract
as
it
be
be
negotiate
despite
warning
from
others
in
the
industry
that
google
would
steal
visitor
from
jeeves
berkowitz
inked
a
multiyear
deal
with
the
search
leader
in
july
of
at
the
last
minute
an
additional
year
be
add
to
the
pact
so
that
the
announcement
base
on
annual
projection
that
share
revenue
would
reach
million
would
garner
more
attention
still
the
deal
make
no
sense
to
many
industry
watcher
since
both
google
and
ask
jeeves
be
search
engine
seek
user
berkowitz
have
a
different
view
the
idea
be
you
can
compete
and
cooperate
at
the
same
time
that
be
what
we
be
do
with
google
i
call
it
coopetition
he
say
at
the
end
of
the
day
ask
jeeves
would
only
survive
by
take
bold
step
the
agreement
in
fact
have
immense
upside
for
both
firm
for
ask
jeeves
there
be
much
need
revenue
for
google
there
be
proof
that
it
could
partner
with
web
site
and
other
search
engine
without
their
fear
that
google
would
siphon
their
traffic
this
agreement
will
put
our
advertiser
in
front
of
million
of
new
user
while
also
offering
them
new
audience
characteristic
distinct
to
ask
jeeves
say
eric
schmidt
google
and
ask
jeeves
have
a
share
vision
of
make
it
easy
and
efficient
for
people
to
search
on
the
web
by
work
in
partnership
we
will
help
grow
the
overall
search
market
the
google
economy
deliver
the
advertising
and
revenue
berkowitz
have
hop
for
ask
jeeves
turn
the
corner
and
become
profitable
by
the
fourth
quarter
of
at
the
same
time
it
deliver
customer
to
google
it
otherwise
wouldn
t
have
have
the
overlap
of
user
be
so
small
that
the
partnership
make
sense
for
both
firm
google
also
use
the
ask
jeeves
deal
as
a
sell
point
as
it
sought
to
sign
up
more
affiliate
of
all
size
to
display
its
ad
and
thus
join
the
google
economy
as
google
add
its
search
and
advertising
service
to
the
web
version
of
the
new
york
time
and
to
amazon
com
and
other
high
traffic
site
the
google
economy
built
tremendous
momentum
increase
the
inventory
of
place
where
its
ad
could
be
displayed
the
number
of
business
bidding
for
those
place
and
the
price
they
be
willing
to
pay
the
google
economy
in
full
regalia
also
have
a
self
reinforce
effect
the
more
computer
user
who
clicked
on
google
ad
the
more
money
web
site
owner
would
make
the
more
money
they
make
the
more
other
site
would
be
willing
and
eager
to
add
google
search
and
ad
technology
to
their
offering
the
big
the
network
grow
the
harder
it
would
be
for
anyone
to
challenge
it
just
as
the
major
tv
network
be
the
best
place
to
go
for
advertiser
seek
broad
audience
google
be
become
the
destination
for
display
ad
online
to
quantify
the
power
of
the
google
economy
it
help
to
look
at
the
ask
jeeves
financial
result
since
most
of
its
revenue
be
derive
from
ad
deliver
to
it
via
google
after
post
a
loss
in
it
have
revenue
of
million
in
which
more
than
double
to
million
in
when
ask
jeeves
record
profit
of
more
than
million
the
partnership
be
so
successful
that
the
party
later
would
announce
that
they
be
extend
it
through
ask
jeeves
have
become
a
prime
beneficiary
of
sound
management
and
the
google
economy
we
look
forward
to
maintain
our
partnership
with
google
as
we
continue
to
deliver
great
experience
to
our
user
while
grow
the
immense
opportunity

berkowitz
say
chapter
and
on
the
fifth
day
krishna
bharat
watch
in
horror
from
a
hotel
room
in
new
orleans
on
september
as

attack
new
york
and
washington
bharat
a
year
old
google
software
engineer
from
india
flip
through
television
channel
and
furiously
search
the
web
to
learn
as
much
as
he
could
about
what
have
happen
he
worried
about
his
family
and
his
travel
plan
since
all
plane
have
be
ground
by
the
federal
government
he
quickly
forgot
about
the
forum
on
information
retrieval
that
he
be
attend
in
new
orleans
as
do
others
gather
in
the
hotel
with
him
instead
he
focus
entirely
on
the
bad
attack
on
u
s
soil
since
pearl
harbor
out
of
such
moment
of
crisis
and
devastation
great
idea
be
sometimes
born
for
bharat
september
marked
such
a
new
begin
as
a
young
man
grow
up
in
india
bharat
be
in
his
own
word
a
news
junkie
he
read
indian
newspaper
watch
indian
television
read
time
magazine
and
sat
with
his
grandfather
who
live
with
his
family
listen
to
radio
news
report
from
the
bbc
recognize
that
censorship
and
cultural
issue
sometimes
get
in
the
way
bharat
soon
caught
on
to
the
notion
that
if
he
really
want
to
understand
an
event
he
need
to
turn
to
multiple
source
of
information
particularly
if
the
news
related
to
india
there
be
certain
subject
that
be
just
too
sensitive
for
the
indian
medium
to
treat
openly
or
in
full
so
each
week
bharat
eagerly
wait
for
time
to
arrive
and
become
fascinate
by
the
notion
of
how
his
grandfather
kept
inform
about
local
and
world
event
this
sear
experience
as
a
youth
ultimately
influence
his
think
about
some
of
what
he
would
do
as
a
grown
up
after
graduate
from
georgia
tech
with
his
ph
d
bharat
move
to
california
and
go
to
work
for
digital
equipment
in
palo
alto
where
his
focus
include
consult
for
the
altavista
search
engine
the
job
increase
his
interest
in
web
search
building
on
his
background
and
education
in
information
retrieval
along
the
way
he
met
google
s
founder
i
understood
google
technology
and
altavista
technology
and
i
really
like
larry
and
sergey
and
their
attitude
bharat
recall
in
he
join
the
guy
at
google
and
with
a
fellow
colleague
from
digital
he
found
google
s
research
group
in
his
new
position
bharat
work
on
a
wide
array
of
task
since
many
area
of
the
search
engine
have
not
be
developed
be
in
the
research
group
also
give
him
the
opportunity
to
emphasize
project
with
a
longer
term
time
horizon
than
those
undertaken
by
most
of
his
google
colleague
i
work
on
thing
like
try
to
understand
how
google
be
use
and
behaves
for
million
of
people
he
say
but
google
have
something
else
special
about
it
that
bharat
relish
a
rule
that
software
engineer
spend
at
least
percent
of
their
time
or
one
day
a
week
work
on
whatever
project
interested
them
the
percent
rule
be
a
way
of
encourage
innovation
and
both
brin
and
page
saw
this
as
essential
to
establish
and
maintain
the
right
culture
and
create
a
place
where
bright
technologist
would
want
to
work
and
be
motivate
to
come
up
with
breakthrough
idea
at
other
company
freelance
on
side
project
and
new
idea
typically
be
frown
upon
make
it
difficult
for
entrepreneurial
employee
who
often
found
they
have
to
work
on
them
in
secret
without
their
bos
s
knowledge
at
google
the
percent
approach
sent
the
opposite
message
spend
one
day
a
week
on
something
you
not
your
bos
be
passionate
about
and
don
t
worry
about
such
pedestrian
matter
as
whether
the
idea
could
be
a
moneymaker
or
something
that
could
be
turn
into
a
successful
product
in
other
word
please
yourself
this
percent
rule
be
unusual
in
modern
business
but
it
do
have
a
precedent
many
year
earlier
m
the
company
behind
the
consumer
brand
scotch
tape
developed
a
percent
rule
to
spur
innovation
by
direct
its
engineer
to
spend
a
portion
of
their
paid
time
on
project
of
their
own
choose
for
m
the
extra
time
to
dream
yield
among
other
thing
the
idea
for
post
it
note
the
more
direct
influence
on
brin
and
page
to
adopt
a
flex
day
for
its
engineer
stem
from
the
arrangement
they
have
witness
at
university
where
faculty
often
spend
four
day
a
week
in
the
office
and
pursue
research
or
other
project
on
the
fifth
since
sergey
and
larry
have
dwell
in
a
university
environment
their
entire
life
until
take
leave
from
stanford
to
found
google
extend
that
collegiate
atmosphere
of
freedom
and
self
direction
to
their
new
company
seem
natural
the
percent
time
be
invent
for
people
to
just
explore
bharat
say
people
be
productive
when
they
be
work
on
thing
they
see
as
important
or
they
have
invent
or
be
work
on
something
they
be
passionate
about
this
be
also
an
opportunity
to
get
bottom
up
innovation
there
be
only
so
much
that
top
management
can
specify
or
ordain
engineer
have
the
choice
of
use
their
percent
time
each
week
or
pool
it
then
spending
a
month
work
on
a
project
people
talk
over
lunch
about
the
thing
they
be
play
with
bharat
say
it
be
like
they
be
the
ceo
of
their
own
little
company
once
an
idea
matures
a
little
bit
they
tend
to
talk
about
it
in
a
more
public
forum
but
still
only
within
the
confines
of
the
company
one
way
of
circulate
word
about
what
they
be
do
be
through
bulletin
board
on
google
s
internal
computer
network
but
the
company
also
set
aside
time
for
peer
review
where
engineer
can
receive
feedback
on
their
budding
idea
positive
feedback
implies
other
people
be
willing
to
work
with
you
and
you
have
the
prerequisite
then
for
a
project
bharat
say
then
you
can
go
and
build
it
google
have
a
way
of
have
these
idea
germinate
in
percent
time
and
blossom
in
the
idea
forum
then
some
idea
will
get
fund
and
become
something
that
management
track
to
make
sure
the
project
see
the
light
of
day
rather
than
have
employee
moonlight
as
inventor
at
home
with
the
risk
that
an
idea
will
either
fail
from
lack
of
resource
or
succeed
to
the
point
that
they
quit
to
pursue
it
full
time
google
give
them
both
freedom
and
resource
fundamentally
this
be
a
wonderful
paradigm
and
have
contribute
to
a
lot
of
google
engineer
produce
thing
bharat
say
when
bharat
be
a
doctoral
student
at
georgia
tech
in
the
mid
s
he
indulge
his
passion
for
news
by
develop
a
new
type
of
newspaper
he
have
want
to
see
if
he
could
devise
a
way
for
a
crawler
an
online
vacuum
cleaner
of
sort
to
take
similar
wire
service
news
story
from
disparate
web
site
and
bring
them
to
a
single
place
where
they
could
be
repackaged
and
easily
read
by
people
interested
in
those
subject
this
be
my
first
taste
of
online
news
he
say
there
be
not
many
online
news
source
at
the
time
in
addition
bharat
who
have
a
sharp
eye
and
a
knack
for
organize
information
in
easily
accessible
way
want
to
find
a
way
to
design
a
newspaper
that
cater
to
the
interest
of
individual
reader
and
their
habit
rather
than
come
up
with
a
single
design
for
everyone
my
original
idea
be
really
well
layout
i
know
how
to
customize
thing
nicely
the
way
news
be
organize
in
a
newspaper
format
online
you
have
to
click
on
a
link
and
then
come
back
i
say
i
can
do
a
well
layout
than
that
then
i
realize
we
could
observe
what
people
do
so
maybe
we
could
turn
this
around
and
make
tomorrow
s
newspaper
ahead
of
time
to
your
like
it
all
come
together
on
september
bharat
s
upbringing
in
india
surround
by
multiple
news
source
the
work
he
have
do
on
newspaper
at
georgia
tech
and
google
s
emphasis
on
percent
time
and
innovation
on
a
day
when
access
to
credible
information
really
count
he
begin
conceive
of
a
well
faster
and
easy
way
for
computer
user
generally
and
journalist
specifically
to
learn
what
be
be
write
and
say
around
the
world
in
the
back
of
his
mind
lay
the
memory
of
his
indian
grandfather
listen
to
the
bbc
there
be
so
much
go
on
and
so
many
point
of
view
the
american
view
the
world
view
the
afghanistan
view
the
european
view
it
be
so
fascinate
i
realize
the
web
be
inconvenient
for
research
a
topic
you
want
to
understand
broadly
bharat
say
every
newspaper
do
a
great
job
of
put
out
content
but
they
didn
t
have
the
time
or
inclination
to
cross
link
to
other
subject
news
be
also
real
time
there
be
no
way
for
a
washington
post
reporter
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
find
other
article
be
write
on
the
same
subject
of
course
web
search
engine
then
be
not
make
it
easy
for
you
to
find
other
relevant
article
reader
like
me
and
journalist
themselves
could
benefit
from
this
since
it
take
a
long
time
to
find
out
what
others
have
write
or
say
especially
on
a
topic
like
september
with
so
many
differ
opinion
i
decide
this
be
a
problem
worth
solve
for
the
next
few
month
bharat
work
on
solve
the
problem
he
have
see
so
vividly
on
september
there
be
so
many
issue
and
subsidiary
issue
to
tackle
at
once
fundamental
to
his
vision
be
an
exploration
of
whether
he
could
write
a
set
of
mathematical
equation
that
would
simulate
on
an
automate
basis
the
kind
of
decision
that
experienced
newspaper
editor
make
about
story
and
layout
use
a
technique
know
as
cluster
he
begin
divide
story
into
category
range
from
world
news
to
politics
to
business
to
sport
and
then
watch
how
little
or
much
editorial
activity
be
generate
by
a
specific
story
next
he
begin
adjust
the
rank
of
story
base
on
their
origin
with
great
weight
give
to
story
write
by
reporter
for
lead
u
s
newspaper
and
wire
service
include
the
new
york
time
the
washington
post
the
associate
press
and
reuters
at
the
same
time
inclusiveness
be
important
so
no
matter
how
big
and
prestigious
or
small
and
obscure
a
news
source
might
be
bharat
want
to
find
a
way
to
include
it
give
the
importance
of
update
to
the
news
and
the
real
time
nature
of
what
he
envision
bharat
s
formula
also
increase
the
rank
of
fresher
story
over
old
news
this
must
be
compute
over
and
over
again
this
become
a
real
time
operation
he
say
in
create
different
edition
of
his
online
news
site
he
also
add
relevance
to
the
mix
for
example
all
other
thing
be
equal
a
u
s
story
would
be
of
great
interest
to
computer
user
in
the
united
state
than
a
canadian
story
and
vice
versa
this
might
be
of
particular
value
if
different
edition
of
bharat
s
project
dubbed
google
news
come
into
be
by
late
or
early
he
have
developed
the
initial
version
of
storyrank
a
first
cousin
of
the
pagerank
formula
use
to
prioritize
google
search
result
but
it
be
not
sufficient
he
realize
to
show
headline
alone
so
with
the
help
of
others
he
built
a
search
function
specifically
for
the
online
news
he
be
collect
there
would
always
be
much
more
news
than
could
be
show
on
any
homepage
but
a
search
for
the
news
would
let
the
user
decide
in
a
google
like
way
what
subject
to
highlight
two
other
googlers
work
with
bharat
to
build
a
work
demo
which
be
release
within
the
company
to
gauge
reaction
from
others
he
knew
he
be
onto
something
big
in
december
when
ceo
eric
schmidt
drop
in
to
chat
about
google
news
i
knew
this
be
popular
bharat
say
i
get
a
lot
of
feedback
from
engineer
suddenly
eric
schmidt
walk
into
my
office
and
say
this
be
a
cool
product
i
don
t
even
know
how
long
he
have
be
at
google
at
that
time
but
he
be
really
interested
and
want
to
make
it
happen
then
subsequently
i
spoke
to
larry
and
sergey
and
they
be
both
very
interested
with
excitement
in
the
rank
and
the
endorsement
from
the
top
bharat
s
percent
time
project
turn
into
a
full
time
endeavor
for
bharat
it
be
the
fulfillment
of
a
dream
and
in
keep
with
google
practice
he
receive
the
resource
necessary
to
take
the
demo
and
build
it
into
something
that
would
shine
online
for
million
of
user
that
meant
designer
who
would
focus
on
the
user
interface
a
season
product
manager
marissa
mayer
to
shape
the
product
and
study
it
from
the
user
perspective
and
a
team
of
engineer
to
refine
and
test
the
software
that
crawl
the
web
ranked
story
and
organize
disparate
information
into
a
comprehensible
whole
at
google
if
something
be
worth
do
it
get
fund
bharat
say
note
that
no
one
ever
ask
how
the
product
would
make
money
what
give
google
the
right
to
republish
news
produce
by
various
medium
company
on
its
own
web
site
nothing
really
but
the
concept
caught
on
so
quickly
that
news
organization
want
to
be
a
part
of
it
google
news
always
identify
the
origin
of
the
news
story
it
carry
and
let
user
click
to
be
take
to
that
source
google
in
effect
be
serve
as
a
news
broker
it
didn
t
pretend
to
own
the
news
it
be
republish
which
meant
the
company
do
not
necessarily
need
to
license
and
pay
for
the
news
it
retrieve
from
hundred
and
later
thousand
of
medium
outlet
i
much
prefer
this
model
bharat
say
we
want
to
be
the
information
access
point
but
we
don
t
want
to
own
the
content
we
do
what
we
be
best
at
which
be
bring
people
to
content
that
matter
to
them
quickly
unlike
the
clean
uncluttered
google
homepage
the
google
news
page
be
packed
with
headline
and
content
we
want
to
make
sure
the
information
be
really
dense
it
have
to
be
a
content
rich
page
to
get
a
lot
of
information
to
the
user
say
mayer
use
newspaper
lingo
she
say
that
in
select
a
final

to
the
quantity

without

google

caught
on
with
computer

alike
lead
to
new
innovation
such
as
google

an
automatic
way
for
people
to
track
specific
topic
of
interest
by

bharat
do
not
develop
the

by
that
point
in

he
have
move
on
to

more
efficient
it
also
lead
to
a
great
share
of

since
article
from
an
array
of
source
around
the
world
from
the
lead
metropolitan
daily
to
small

be
read
more
widely
the
very
fact
that

article
on
various
subject
be
juxtapose
increase

reading
bharat

provide
the
opportunity
to
find
out
information
and
then
i
want
feedback
from
people
who
read
the
information
i
want
there
to
be
a
big
debate
about
issue
i
would
love
to
see
that
happen
craig
nevill
man
join
google
in
after
work
as
a
professor
at
rutgers
university
in
new
jersey
where
he
have
focus
on
find
innovative
way
to
extract
information
from
web
site
a
native
of
new
zealand
he
be
attract
to
google
not
only
by
the
idea
of
do
interest
research
which
he
be
do
already
but
also
by
have
his
idea
turn
into
product
that
people
could
use
born
in
may
he
be
old
than
most
googlers
have
enter
the
world
two
month
before
astronaut
neil
armstrong
become
the
first
man
to
walk
on
the
moon
give
his
age
and
stature
nevill

who
have
do
a
postdoctoral
fellowship
at
stanford
carry
the
title
of
senior
research
scientist
like
others
he
be
attract
to
google
by
its
culture
of
innovation
include
percent
time
it
didn
t
take
long
after
his
arrival
at
google
for
nevill
man
to
use
his
time
to
begin
explore
the
field
of
online
retailing
i
be
talk
with
another
product
manager
about
the
fact
that
when
people
come
to
google
look
to
buy
we
didn
t
necessarily
do
a
good
job
of
help
them
we
didn
t
have
good
coverage
of
what
be
on
the
web
and
you
often
want
to
be
able
to
look
at
comparative
product
and
price
we
start
to
think
about
what
we
could
do
to
make
this
well
he
say
nevill
man
study
various
online
retailer
closely
include
amazon
com
look
at
how
they
extract
information
base
on
category
price
and
description
after
about
six
month
he
turn
his
idea
into
a
prototype
on
a
lark
he
name
the
computer
file
where
he
store
the
code
for
his
new
creation
froogle
since
it
rhyme
with
google
and
conveyed
the
hunt
for
value
that
consume
consumer
internally
the
official
code
name
for
the
initiative
be
product
search
in
early
he
take
his
prototype
to
larry
sergey
and
eric
to
get
their
reaction
they
like
the
idea
but
weren
t
sure
whether
it
be
worth
far
exploration
one
linger
question
be
whether
froogle
could
become
part
of
google
s
core
search
or
have
to
be
its
own
product
offering
nevill
man
recognize
that
the
right
thing
to
do
be
focus
on
his
day
to
day
work
on
google
s
advertising
system
and
he
set
the
idea
aside
we
have
a
million
good
idea
at
google
and
can
only
devote
significant
resource
to
a
small
subset
of
them
to
do
this
would
mean
several
engineer
and
take
month
to
do
it
i
shelve
froogle
for
a
while
and
go
back
to
work
on
adwords
he
say
but
as
time
go
by
nevill
man
found
it
hard
to
let
go
of
froogle
he
begin
refining
the
concept
and
persuade
himself
and
eventually
others
that
it
be
worth
pursue
aggressively
the
guy
at
the
top
be
not
so
sure
it
sort
of
hung
there
while
people
thought
about
it
and
how
it
would
fit
he
recall
we
get
clearer
on
what
the
product
be
we
generate
many
many
idea
through
this
percent
time
and
then
there
be
a
funnel
because
we
can
t
take
all
of
these
idea
and
make
them
product
froogle
be
try
to
get
through
that
funnel
every
so
often
he
would
walk
into
sergey
s
office
to
talk
about
froogle
and
show
him
the
late
feature
and
idea
the
hurdle
that
he
have
to
overcome
be
whether
froogle
could
be
comprehensive
and
scalable
like
the
core
google
search
engine
the
proof
of
the
pudding
be
have
larry
say
i
be
look
to
buy
a
new
digital
camera
and
he
typed
that
in
or
sergey
say
i
know
of
some
green
laser
pointer
that
just
become
available
let
s
see
if
we
can
find
them
on
froogle
fundamentally
it
come
down
to
can
you
find
those
new
or
obscure
product
those
be
the
thing
google
be
good
at
find
in
the
nook

a

about

at

whether
it

or
window
dress
to

technologist
ignite
among
googlers
and
microsoft
employee
add
to
the
tension
between
the

google
engineer
joe
beda
praise
percent
time
and
explain
why
it
work
well
inside
google
headquarters
there
be
a
big
difference
between
pet
project
be
permit
and
be
encourage
beda
say
at
google
it
be
actively
encourage
for
engineer
to
do
a
percent
project
this
isn
t
a
matter
of
do
something
in
your
spare
time
but
more
of
actively
make
time
for
it
heck
i
don
t
have
a
good
percent
project
yet
and
i
need
one
if
i
don
t
come
up
with
something
i
m
sure
it
could
negatively
impact
my
review
the
intrapersonal
environment
at
google
be
very
energize
when
someone
come
up
with
a
new
idea
the
most
common
response
be
excitement
and
a
brainstorming
session
politics
and
who
own
what
rarely
enter
into
it
i
don
t
think
that
i
ve
see
anyone
really
raise
their
voice
and
get
into
a
huge
knock
down
drag
out
fight
since
come
to
google
beda
say
can
percent
time
work
at
other
company
i
m
sure
there
be
go
to
be
others
that
try
however
i
think
that
it
be
important
to
realize
that
it
be
a
result
of
an
environment
and
a
philosophy
i
don
t
think
that
it
be
something
that
can
be
impose
in
an
independent
way
i
d
like
to
stress
that
these
comment
be
my
own
and
aren
t
any
sort
of
official
word
from
google
please
don
t
draw
any
grand
conclusion
of
corporate
strategy
and
such
but
a
microsoft
technologist
have
a
different
point
of
view
google
he
claim
may
not
be
as
different
from
other
technology
firm
as
the
company
or
its
employee
like
to
pretend
why
doesn
t
microsoft
have
percent
time
well
speak
for
myself
if
bill
gate
told
me
i
could
have
percent
time
i
d
say
that
s
nice
bill
but
i
m
already
work
on
what
i
want
to
work
on
maybe
i
m
a
rarity
at
microsoft
but
i
don
t
think
so
if
any
employee
isn
t
happy
where
he
or
she
be
there
be
lot
of
opportunity
to
move
around
the
thing
be
i
need
percent
time
to
do
all
the
work
i
hate
to
do
like
expense
report
or
other
corporate
procedure
and
process
now
if
someone
could
take
those
kind
of
chore
away
then
that
would
be
an
employee
benefit
i
d
really
like

among
trust
employee
who
sample
it
inside
the

they
refrain
from
say
anything
about
it
to
outsider
but
the
excitement
over
gmail
s
public
debut
be
mount
to
generate
the
kind
of
word
of
mouth
buzz
that
have
make
google
the
lead

the
company
decide
to
first
give
the
product
to
about

then
allow

them
to

away
a
limited
number
of
gmail
account
to
family
and

only
this
would
allow

time
to
get
any

out
of
the

offering
and
since
it
be
give
away
one

with

it
would
also
provide

always
remain
well
ahead
of
any
demand
on
its
computer

to
make
money
even
during
the
test
phase
with
demand
for

increase
the
company
need
to
increase
the
amount
of

make
sense
to
larry
and
sergey
to
profit
from
gmail
by
put
the
same
type
of
small
ad
on
the

hand
side
of
gmails
that
google
put
on
the

side
of

result
the
ad
would
be
contextually
relevant
trigger
by
word
contain
in
the

it
be
a
proven
business
model
that
serve

user
well
as

of
google

more

on
the

network
gmail
would
provide
a
healthy
new
stream
of
profit
for
the
company
that
would
grow
over
time
as
the
communication
technology
caught
on
look
at
the
world
through
google
color
lens
this
seem
like
a
superb
idea
in
every
respect
it
didn
t
occur
to
larry
sergey
or
any
of
the
other
engineer
in
senior
role
at
google
that
serious
people
they
respect
would
strenuously
object
to
the
privacy
implication
of
have
google
s
computer
reading
email
and
then
place
ad
in
them
base
on
the
content
of
those
message
in
their
virtual
reality
they
remain
oblivious
to
the
political
reality
that
await
them
and
because
they
be
software
developer
operating
in
something
of
a
vacuum
they
fail
to
get
advice
from
the
right
people
or
to
brief
opinion
leader
in
advance
or
to
do
anything
that
would
have
head
off
the
uproar
over
privacy
issue
that
gmail
spark
at
risk
be
nothing
less
than
google
s
good
name
and
reputation
for
the
two
founder
who
pride
themselves
on
be
well
inform
it
would
be
a
harsh
lesson
in
the
danger
of
be
too
clever
and
too
cloister
to
give
gmail
an
add
dimension
of
fun
and
free
publicity
larry
and
sergey
chose
to
announce
the
hot
new
offering
on
april
in
prior
year
google
have
make
fanciful
april
fool
announcement
as
a
joke
so
when
journalist
and
others
heard
about
gmail
s
gigabyte
of
free
storage
on
april
fool
day
they
wouldn
t
know
whether
it
be
real
or
make
up
that
would
generate
more
chatter
and
question
heighten
interest
without
cost
the
company
any
money
on
advertising
or
marketing
and
that
be
just
the
way
the
google

that

available
first
to
a
small
number
of

and
that
with
luck

prove
popular

work
while

that

challenged
google

about

about

besides
as
they
repeat
to
themselves
inside
the

people
must
know
that
the
other

more
look
at
that
way
gmail

those
be
the
fact
because
from
their
perspective
this
be
much

about
nothing
larry

saw
no

in

all
the

would
certainly
heighten

its

progeny
soon
enough
friendly
columnist
who
test

fell
in

with
it
would

about
why
the

company
might
have
seriously
consider
pull
gmail
at

temporarily

this

out
without

the

side
of

even
if
it
seem
a
little
spooky
at
first
it
s
useful
he
say
but
as
the
anti

force
gain
strength
not
everyone
at

be
sanguine
about
the

major
investor

furious
about
the

about

how
could
ceo
eric
schmidt
have
allow
this
to
happen
just
week
before
the

company
be
set

reveal
its

to
go

he
be
suppose
to
prevent
the
google
guy
from
do
thing
they
regard
as
really
smart
but
the
rest
of
the
mere
mortal
on
the
planet
would
consider
dumb
or
at
least
ill
time
the
gmail
fight
have
the
potential
to
give
google
a
black
eye
and
damage
its
credibility
left
unchecked
gmail
could
undermine
the
single
most
important
asset
that
google
have
the
trust
of
hundred
of
million
of
computer
user
and
advertiser
around
the
world
it
have
the
potential
to
destroy
year
of
goodwill
moreover
while
google
have
brought
this
upon
itself
microsoft
yahoo
and
other
competitor
would
seize
the
opportunity
to
keep
the
negative
spate
of
story
alive
they
would
put
the
word
out
that
google
really
be
different
for
example
it
retain
copy
of
all
email
even
those
that
individual
delete
page
s
view
be
that
google
s
big
blunder
be
not
the
ad
feature
in
gmail
but
the
way
it
have
roll
out
the
new
email
service
we
learn
a
few
thing
larry
say
we
could
have
do
a
well
job
on
the
message
people
start
talk
about
it
before
they
could
try
it
i
didn
t
expect
them
to
be
so
interested
we
release
the
privacy
policy
and
they
be
very
interested
in
that
it
be
all
they
have
access
to
so
it
spark
a
lot
of
controversy
either
larry
or
sergey
need
to
get
more
involve
if
they
be
to
stop
the
anti
gmail
force
and
to
do
that
they
need
a
bona
fide
privacy
group
who
could
advise
them
one
that
would
tell
them
the
truth
no
matter
how
dire
without
be
alarmist
although
he
want
to
focus
on
user
larry
recognize
the
need
to
view
gmail
from
a
political
and
privacy
perspective
he
have
a
friend
in
the
privacy
world
brad
templeton
and
it
be
time
to
reach
out
to
him
templeton
be
a
man
who
have
be
around
cyberspace
so
long
and
have
be
at
the
birth
of
so
many
breakthrough
that
he

when
initial
decision
be
be
make
about

for
the

templeton
wore
a
lot
of
hat
he
be
chairman
of
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
a
lead
privacy
advocate
he
be
larry
s
friend
and
burning
man
compatriot
he
have
consult
for
google
and
he
earn
money
from
have
google
deliver
ad
on
his
personal
web
site
it
be
time
to
turn
to
him
for
counsel
as
page
saw
it
if
there
be
an
honest
broker
in
the
gmail
debate
it
be
brad
templeton
and
the
electronic
frontier
foundation
the
group
templeton
chair
have
decline
to
join
the
coalition
call
on
google
to
scrap
gmail
though
templeton
view
the
immediate
privacy
issue
and
their
long
term
implication
very
seriously
give
his
liberal
upbringing
page
understood
the
importance
of
strike
a
balance
on
issue
like
these
templeton
for
his
part
have
come
to
think
of
gmail
as
complex
not
as
good
or
evil
it
fell
into
a
gray
zone
depend
on
various
circumstance
he
discuss
the
matter
with
his
colleague
kevin
bankston
at
the
eff
bankston
felt
it
make
sense
for
people
worried
about
privacy
to
take
matter
into
their
own
hand
by
use
one
firm
for
email
and
another
company
for
search
that
way
the
information
about
them
would
not
all
be
in
one
place
there
be
danger
of
one
stop
shopping
for
online
service
from
a
privacy
perspective
he
say
the
best
thing
to
do
be
to
break
it
apart
i
would
not
use
my
primary
email
provider
for
search
templeton
met
with
page
to
review
the
implication
of
gmail
and
then
developed
a
thoughtful
even
hand
analysis
of
its
pro
and
con
google
should
encrypt
email
so
it
be
technically
impossible
to
search
the
entire
archive
he
say
they
should
distill
and
strip
personal
information
from
their
log
the
step
google
can
take
involve
sacrifice
so
they
haven
t
take
them
they
be
do
research
and
like
to
go
and
look
back
at
pattern
of
user
and
customer
so
they
be
not
destroy
it
templeton
address
the
google
privacy
clash
artfully
while
there
have
be
over
reaction
to
gmail
he
write
there
be
some
real
issue
here
to
be
worried
about
these
include
under
current
federal
law
the
loss
of
legal
protection
for
email
retain
by
google
for
more
than
day
he
say
that
correlation
of
gmail
and
google
search
something
google
be
do
in
order
to
customize
and
personalize
service
for
computer
user
pose
enormous
privacy
risk
and
these
would
only
become
more
pronounce
as
more
people
use
gmail
and
more
of
their
life
move
online
in
the
modern
era
where
computer
threaten
privacy
we
be
as
afraid
of
outside
computer
know
all
about
our
life
as
much
as
we
be
outside
people
one
reason
for
this
templeton
state
be
the
reality
that
information
store
on
external
computer
have
sometimes
found
its
way
out
into
the
world
and
fall
into
the
wrong
hand
by
have
email
and
search
store
on
google
s
computer
outside
of
their
home
people
be
inadvertently
building
the
database
for
what
he
term
a
surveillance
society
when
our
paper
be
at
home
mass
surveillance
of
them
simply
doesn
t
scale
it
s
too
expensive
they
must
be
broken
into
a
million
time
online
it
scale
well
those
outside
machine
must
be
compromise
by
the
law
or
system
cracker
only
once
templeton
also
cite
global
issue
that
google
have
not
address
in
consider
gmail
in
advance
of
its
release
the
way
that
government
in
different
country
would
respect
or
invade
the
google
database
base
on
their
own
culture
and
law
when
we
build
our
system
templeton
say
how
often
do
we
think
of
what
it
will
mean
when
they
become
popular
in
china
or
saudi
arabia
or
what
it
mean
when
they
be
sell
to
other
company
whose
policy
be
not
so
benevolent
most
of
all
templeton
say
computer
user
themselves
need
to
be
aware
of
the
peril
they
could
face
you
should
have
no
more
expectation

the

attention
with
an
unusual
letter
about
the
company

their
view

worried
about
the
potential
consequence
of
the
draft

any

who
disagreed

sought
to
change
the

a

would

long

google
be
a
pure

technology
firm
that
unlike
some
rival
include

do
not
own
or
generate
original
content
but
it
earn
its
profit
from
advertising
a
classic
trait
of
a
medium
company
in
their
letter
the
founder
laid
out
plan
for
google
to
issue
two
class
of
stock
class
a
share
for
regular
investor
which
carry
one
vote
each
and
class
b
stock
for
themselves
carry
ten
vote
per
share
and
give
them
absolute
control
the
dual
class
structure
would
make
a
takeover
of
the
company
impossible
without
their
approval
would
discourage
public
investor
from
seek
to
influence
management
and
would
facilitate
their
ability
to
run
the
company
without
interference
this
be
the
ideal
way
for
them
to
stay
in
charge
while
google
raise
billion
of
dollar
by
go
public
brin
and

justified
the
two
class
of
stock
with
unequal
voting
right

compare
six
year

the
multiple
class
of
stock
use
by
the
family
that
control
these
newspaper
in
order
to
preserve
editorial
independence
for
a
pair
of
iconoclastic
thinker
who
love
silicon
valley
and
reject
the
traditional
way
of
wall
street
when
it
come
down
to
make
the
most
convincing
and
persuasive
case
possible
it
be
a
matter
of
not
confuse
principle
with
preference
the
main
effect
of
this
structure
be
likely
to
leave
our
team
especially
sergey
and
me
with
increasingly
significant
control
over
the

the

all
have
similar
dual
class
ownership
structure
we
believe
a
dual
class
structure
will
enable
google
as
a
public
company
to
retain
many
of
the
positive
aspect
of
be
private
the
propose
dual
class
structure
lack
one
of
the
essential
ingredient
that
brin
and
page
sprinkle
inside
google
to
maintain
the
work
ethic
of
their
employee
accountability
to
put

simply
virtually
everyone

there
have

or
someone
senior
and
they
even
insist
on

and
test
result
the
founder
who
have
the
ultimate
power
to
hire
and
fire
have
face
no
similar
system
of
accountability
when
they
ran
google
as
a
private
company
and
they
saw
no
need
to
change
that
as
the
firm
make
the
transition
to
public
ownership
this
meant
they
could
dismiss
eric

as
easily
as
the
most
recently

software
engineer
as
an

you

don

as

they

what

our

which
we
work
hard
to

we
label

this

some

with

the

up
such

might

good
for

google
say
it
pose
additional

the

in
addition
google
warn
that
its

the
inevitable
decline
in
growth
rate
as
our
revenue
increase
to
a
high
level
then
there
be
the
question
of
google
s
exclusive
reliance
on
advertising
and
one
particular
type
of
advertising
for
all
of
its

that
be
potentially
quite
problematic
if

gain
ground
on

the
reduction

now
most
of
its

half
of

there
be
a
dark
side
there

the

despite

close
to
the

google

auction
method

either
the

may
result

as
a

investor
may
experience
significant
loss
the
company
warn
successful
bidder
may
conclude
that
they
paid
too
much
for
our
share
and
could
seek
to
immediately
sell
their

to
limit

should
our

decline

enter
the

day
of

and
the

unorthodox

speculation
mount
that
the

giant
would
do
the
logical
thing
and
wait
until
after
labor
day
to
go
public
it
appear
the
company
be
go
to
raise
billion
of

in
the

and
nobody
attempt
this
kind
of
unconventional
deal
in

it

major

include
company
and
investor
tend
to
vacation
then
too
but
larry
and
sergey
be
different
they
found
the
entire
public
offering
process
to
be
enormously
time
consume
and
a
wasteful
distraction
from
the

the
sooner
they
could
get
the

do
the
sooner
thing
would
return

they
press
forward
even
as

of
give

the
bad

it
have
experienced
since
its
found
one
could
rationally
argue
that
the
combination
of
a
weakly
perform
technology
sector
in
the
stock
market
the
summer
hiatus
and
the
string
of
negative
publicity
that
make

appear
poorly
manage
make
this
just
the
kind
of
public
offering
that
would
do
much
well
a
few
month
later
in
the

after
the

die
down

however
fear
more
damage
to

reputation
as
wall

firm
competitor
and
analyst
found
fault
with
the

s
projection

its
lofty

range
of
to
per

about
time
its
per

earnings
the
propose
price
range
drew
criticism
too
since
it
seem
bubble
like
to
those
who
remember
the
technology
meltdown
several
year
earlier
and
despite
google
s
effort
to
reach
out
to
individual
its
auction
be
complex
it
require
individual
to
establish
account
at
certain
firm
and
follow
a
specific
set
of
hard
to
decipher
rule
that
be
especially
tricky
for
novice
the
founder
want
to
get
the
offering
complete
as
soon
as
possible
and
stop
the
bad
mouth
of
the
firm
during
those
month
in
the
summer
of
google
look
increasingly
vulnerable
the
ipo
be
be
cover
so
closely
that
every
error
or
potential
risk
be
magnify
all
of
this
undermined
the
original
message
from
the
founder
that
investor
who
want
to
own
a
stake
in
google
have
to
trust
larry
and
sergey
do
so
seem
to
be
a
riskier
and
riskier
proposition
for
a
company
that
have
manage
its
image
to
perfection
the
wart
begin
to
make
the
google

seem
less

the

more
like
the
man
behind
the

on

make
its

customer
cautious
about
the

it
be
one
factor
but
not
the
only
one
that
eventually
lead
some
financial
analyst
and
advisor
to
recommend
to
their
customer
that
they
watch
from
the
sideline
whenever
google
do
go
public
and
then
decide
after
the
firm
s
share
begin
trading
whether
they
do
or
do
not
want
to
invest
fear
also
spread
that
in
an
overheat
auction
environment
those
who
purchase

in

could
be
pay
top

leave
the

with
nowhere
to
go
but
down
but
before
that
day
come
fresh
issue
arose
in
the
mind
of
investor
about
whether
google
be
ready
for
prime
time
as
a
public
company
with
medium
report
pour
forth
about

probe
other
legal
problem
and
the
risk
of
the
auction
lead
to
a
sky
high
price
in
the
ipo
serious
question
arose
about
whether
google
could
get
the
deal
do
at
all
at
a
certain
point
it
didn
t
matter
whether
it
be
google
s
rapid
growth
cause
the
problem
its
failure
to
abide
by
every
aspect
of
security
law
along
the
way
or
a
wall
street
campaign
to
sully
the

the
mood
have
shift
since
the
april
ipo
filing
then
the
brand
name
have
be
beyond
reproach
now
question
swirl
rumor
abound
that
shareholder
large
and
small
be
not
participate
in
the
auction
and
that
demand
for
google
share
would
be
so
low
the
company
might
have
to
pull
the
deal
completely

that
when

me
understand
him
after
that
i
i
do
not

of
him
as
just
a
scientist
several
month
after
the
ipo
charlie
ayers
make
the
difficult
decision
to
leave
google
to
open
some
restaurant
of
his
own
in
northern
california
as
google

that

and
his

to
buy

which
start
show
up
in
the

thing
have
start
to
change
at
google
after
it
go
public
and
continued
to
grow
at
an
extraordinary
rate
for
example
there
be
an
increase
number
of
employee
who
have
never
met
or
talk
one
on
one
with
larry
and
sergey
and
ayers
have
also
observe
some
new
internal
dynamic
some
department
head
become
more
proactive
to
meet
their
number
and
in
insist
that
their
lead
manager
and
director
be
bring
number
in
and
stay
on
course
and
not
play
around
like
it
be
pre
ipo
he
say
it
be
really
important
even
if
the
company
be
make
money
hand
over
fist
and
reporting
number
beyond
wall
street

to
run
the

certain
other
area
ayers
say

under
the
tutelage
of
larry
page
typically
insist
on
a
percent
discount
to
enter
into
long
term
agreement
with
supplier
it
be
a
very
effective
way
to
hold
down
spending
while
some
vendor
initially
balk
they
often
come
around
since
google
be
spending
so
much
money
it
be
a
reliable
way
for
them
to
cover
their
overhead
ensure
they
have
plenty
of
demand
to
keep
operating
and
position
themselves
to
profit
from
sale
to
other
company
ayers

another
reason
he

he
spoke

argue
that
geico
s
counsel
be
make
artificial
distinction
between
the
internet
and
traditional
medium
geico
want
to
decide
the
internet
be
different
that
be
base
on
an
incorrect
assumption
that
when
people
type
geico
into
google
s
search
engine
the
only
thing
they
want
be
geico
s
web
site
that
be
wrong
page
far
argue
that
the
legal
doctrine
of
consumer
confusion
do
not
apply
note
that
google
clearly
separate
the
ad
serve
up
with
search
result
place
them
to
the
right
of
web
site
listing
on
the

he
also
state
that
google
like
a
magazine
or
newspaper
be
not
the
responsible
party
when
it
come
to
competitive
advertising
google
be
the
publisher
the
advertiser
writes
the
text
geico
s
argument
might
support
a
claim
against
an
advertiser
but
not
against
google
as
be
customary
in
such
trial
both
side
have
expert
witness
company
official
and
others
ready
to
testify
on
their
behalf
there
would
also
be
ample
opportunity
for
the
two
side
to
cross
examine
witness
but
on
the
third
day
after
thoroughly
rip
apart
geico
s
lead
expert
witness
and
highlight
the
weakness
in
a
survey
do
by
the
company
to
bolster
its
case
michael
page
rise
and
make
a
motion
to
end
the
trial
at
the
opening
of
this
case
i
say
that
the
court
would
be
able
to
dispose
of
this
case
before
hearing
testimony
on
damage
that
get
a
bit
of
a
laugh
but
i
be
quite
serious
now
that
the
court
have
heard
plaintiff
s
case
we
believe
you
can
rule
in
favor
of
google
as
a
matter
of
law
page
say
it
be
an
integral
part
of
geico
s
business
strategy
he
explain
to
sell
car
insurance
direct
to
customer
and
not
allow
other
company
to
quote
rate
it
s
a
perfectly
legitimate
strategy
and
combine
with
a
great
marketing
campaign
have
result
in
a
remarkable
success
story
that
s
their
choice
but
google
cannot
be
liable
for
confusion
that
s
a
natural
part
of
their
business
strategy
what
geico
evidence
show
be
that
the
use
of
trademark
as
keywords
do
not
itself
create
confusion
as
they
bear
the
burden
of
proof
on
this
point
that
s
the
end
of
the
analysis
while
page
say
google
s
policy
and
system
be
design
to
prevent
competitor
from
use
the
geico
name
in
the
headline
or
text
of
their
ad
he
acknowledge
that
the
system
didn
t
work
all
the
time
and
that
improper
ad
sometimes
slip
through
google
vigorously
enforces
that
policy
the
inability
to
achieve
perfect
enforcement
of
that
policy
do
not
give
rise
to
contributory
liability
in
order
to
prevail
on
that
claim
he
say
geico
would
have
to
establish
that
google
encourage
or
knowingly
assist
in
a
violation
of
trademark
law
he
say
there
be
no
such
evidence
before
the
court
because
google
do
not
condone
or
encourage
infringement
quite
to
the
contrary
he
add
we
be
the
first
search
engine
to
implement
a
trademark
enforcement
policy
both
because
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
and
because
it
make
business
sense
page
point
out
that
google
serve
different
set
of
customer
and
have
to
be
sensitive
to
multiple
interest
trademark
owner
be
our
customer
on
the
advertising
side
just
as
the
user
be
our
customer
on
the
search
side
he
say
thus
we
carefully
balance
the
dual
goal
of
protect
trademark
right
on
the
one
hand
with
provide
our
user
with
the
most
complete
and
relevant
information
possible
on
the
other
hand
we
believe
that
our
current
trademark
policy
strike
exactly
the
correct
balance
neither
over
nor
under
protect
trademark
right
therefore
we
ask
that
the
court
enter
judgment
as
a
matter
of
law
in
google

more

both
upon
the

i
think
i
would
like
time
to
write
a
more
detailed
opinion
on
these
legal

what
i
propose
be
that
we
terminate

it

still
have
to
deal
with
its

setback
overseas
where
the

be
obligate
by

to
adhere
to

on

but
it
seemingly
grow

through

a
lucky

the
director
of
the
harvard
university
library
have
heard
all
the
various
scheme
out
there
for
scan
book
into
digital
form
even
one
that
involve
boxing
and
shipping
rare
volume
overseas
where
the
labor
intensive
work
could
be
do
more
cheaply
this
be
out
of
the
question
for
the
hallow
institution
verba
be
charge
with
oversee
harvard
s
library
found
in
be
the
large
academic
library
system
in
the
world
verba
and
the
other
library
trustee
have
discuss
the
option
for
digitize
the
massive
harvard
collection
some
million
volume
but
conclude
that
the
scheme
they
have
see
would
be
incredibly
expensive
and
would
damage
the
book
so
it
be
with
some
skepticism
that
verba
receive
a
representative
of
google
in
who
have
come
to
ask
if
he
would
be
interested
in
have
the
entire
harvard
library
digitize
i
don
t
know
how
to
put
this
i
have
the
feel
they
be
smoking
something
verba
recall
though
he
described
the
initial
conversation
as
cordial
they
touch
on
question
of
cost
disruption
to
the
collection
and
possible
damage
to
book
i
thought
it
would
be
terrific
if
they
could
do
it
verba
say
but
i
express
at
least
as
much
skepticism
as
optimism
i
thought
it
would
be
a
long
time
before
anyone
digitize
a
whole
library
several
month
later
a
team
of
google
s
top
product
development
specialist
return
to
harvard
their
update
presentation
described
a
much
more
efficient
less
damage
mean
of
scan
book
verba
say
i
never
thought
it
would
come
off
when
i
first
heard
about
it
but
when
they
come
back
they
have
do
a
tremendous
amount
of
work
on
the
technical
side
and
think
about
the
issue
it
look
quite
real
so
he
and
a
team
of
harvard
librarian
travel
to
the
googleplex
to
see
the
new
scan
device
for
themselves
we
be
impressed
verba
say
what
be
really
impressive
be
that
they
have
go
and
engineer
a
new
mechanical
mean
of
scan
that
do
the
work
of
put
book
into
a
digital
form
something
that
be
quite
efficient
and
treat
the
book
much
more
gently
than
other
scan
device
people
have
be
marketing
i
think
all
of
us
be
turn
the
next
step
be
to
bring
the
prospect
of
the
project
before
the
harvard
corporation
the
university
s
govern
body
this
be
a
group
for
whom
caution
rule
the
day
the
corporation
want
reassurance
that
the
university
wouldn
t
be
hit
with
lawsuit
for
violate
copyright
or
incur
heavy
cost
even
with
google
s
offer
to
pick
up
the
tab
for
the
scan
project
if
someone
do
something
for
you
it
typically
cost
you
money
as
well
verba
say
then
too
there
would
be
an
old
esteem
university
partner
with
an
upstart
technology
company
in
the
wake
of
the
dot
com
crash
google
have
only
be
around
for
six
year
but
harvard
be
year
old
by
the
late
s
the
technology
for
scan
print
material
into
digital
form
have
become
commonplace
many
office
have
some
type
of
flatbed
scanner
for
convert
document
photograph
or
other
art
into
computer
file
but
the
process
be
not
readily
scalable
to
the
level
of
million
of
book
that
google
hop
to
scan
the
company
need
to
develop
a
mean
to
digitize
the
book
at
high
speed
and
at
a
high
level
of
accuracy
if
it
be
to
make
the
project
worth
do
in
the
spring
of
team
from
google
and
michigan
met
to
review
scan
method
and
technology
in
the
past
michigan
have
not
shy
away
from
dis
binding
the
book
it
digitize
literally
remove
the
binding
to
be
able
to
scan
them
flatter
and
faster
this
speed
up
the
process
but
many
librarian
frown
upon
the
practice
because
it
damage
the
original
book
google
too
have
experiment
with
so
call
destructive
scan
method
for
its
froogle

service
and
an

project
call
google

it
chopped
the
back
off
of

and
shot
individual

through
a

feeder
that
resemble
a
high
performance
photocopier
give
the
large
scale
of
google
s
propose
digitization
however
both
side
agree
that
dis
binding
be
not
an
option
too
many
book
would
be
affected
so
the
google
team
set
out
to
design
a
system
that
move
at
light
speed
but
have
a
light
touch
they
look
at
automate
device
that
turn
page
by
robotic
arm
or
by
air
suction
eliminate
the
human
handle
of
book
which
can
be
damage
even
with
innocent
movement
and
in
the
end
they
opt
for
a
process
that
involve
more
manual
labor
adopt
others
technology
to
suit
their
particular
need
they
would
hire
a
small
army
of
personnel
who
would
be
carefully
train
to
handle
the
book
and
scan
machine
we

we

the

say
adam
smith
a

manager
on
the

effort
it
s
be
as
much
about
process
and
system
as
about
technology
wilkin
be
impressed
with
google
s
solution
it
take
them
longer
than
they
thought
he
say
but
they
do
it
reg
carr
the
affable
director
of
oxford
university
s
bodleian
library
be
in
the
midst
of
raise
money
for
digitization
plan
of
his
own
in
when
he
struck
up
a
conversation
with
raymond
nasr
google
s
director
of
executive
communication
nasr
be
at
oxford
speak
to
a
group
of
business
student
as
part
of
a
silicon
valley
at
oxford
program
and
carr
take
the
opportunity
to
show
him
around
the
storied
gothic
campus
let
its
rich
history
work
its
own
magic
on
his
guest
unaware
of
the
development
at
michigan
and
elsewhere
carr
raise
the
possibility
of
a
collaboration
between
google
and
the
bodleian
my
pitch
be
bodleian
in
term
of
library
be
first
in
class
and
google
in
term
of
information
technology
and
search
be
first
in
class
so
shouldn
t
we
be
do
something
in
partnership
say
carr
in
his
world
of
fund
raise
a
prime
activity
be
find
how
to
get
resource
for
something
you
already
want
to
do
because
the
bodleian
library
at
oxford
be
a
depository
library
meaning
it
receives
a
copy
of
every
book
print
in
the
united
kingdom
just
as
the
library
of
congress
do
in
the
united
state
carr
believe
it
have
special
appeal
for
google
it
be
also
the
second
large
library
in
britain
if
there
be
ever
any
doubt
about
google
s
interest
in
add
oxford
to
the

of

it

put
to

there
be
way
to
shut
down

virtually
all
of
them
would
make

less
profitable
it
could
employ
army
of
people
to
work
on

it

employ

it
put

one
example
of
a

google

its

may
be
the
wave
of
the
future
if
competition
heightens

if

tom
mcgovern
the

his
company
s
approach
give
advertiser
great

dim
to

mcgovern
say
snap
be
the
first
paid
search
vehicle
where
the
interest
of
the
search
engine
and

only
when
a

this
increase
their

return
on

dollar
spent
he
say
instead
of
pay
per
click
the
google

yahoo
way
advertiser
on

could
choose

perpetrator
the
google
economy
have
respond
mostly
with
free
market
solution
self
police
by
google
and
yahoo
and
the
creation
of
a
new
industry
employ
hundred
of
people
who
specialize
in
fight
this
flavor
of
fraud
but
this
be
an
industry
problem
be
address
on
a
piecemeal
basis
no
search
engine
not
google
or
yahoo
or
any
other
have
the
financial
incentive
to
put
sufficient
resource
into
battling
click
fraud
since
the
search
engine
profit
from
its
existence
and
it
mostly
go
undetected
and
unreported
by
advertiser
though
individual
advertiser
can
amass
plenty
of
information
to
illustrate
that
they
appear
to
be
the
victim
of
click
fraud
while
act
alone
they
lack
the
mean
to
stop
it
the
private
firm
that
battle
click
fraud
on
behalf
of
advertiser
seek
to
persuade
google
and
other
search
engine
that
they
have
compile
the
data
that
prof
it
occur
and
demand
refund
in
relative
term
advertiser
on
google
have
suffer
most
from
the
problem
largely
but
not
exclusively
because
google
be
the
big
player
in
this
rapidly
grow
marketing
segment
if
not
combat
click
fraud
may
undermine
confidence
so
much
that
a
self
correct
mechanism
take
hold
advertiser
may
cut
back
on
how
much
they
be
willing
to
spend
or
demand
a
new
system
outright
another
possibility
be
that
major
search
engine
will
join
force
to
fight
the
problem
as
an
industry
as
major

there

extremely
effective
method
to
get
business
to
a

over
a
period
of
time
you
might
see

get
a

rate
instead
of

instead
of
be
willing
to
spend

they
may
bid
per

people
will
take
it
for
grant
that
there
will
be
some
click
of
a
suspicious
nature
but
the
model
will
be
robust
enough
to
withstand
that
i
don
t
think
it
be
go
to
be
an
epidemic
people
will
take
it

it

he

if
there

encounter
many
different

of
a
consumer

then
there
be
a
strange
twist
the
firm
receive
an
anonymous

i
just
want
you
to
know
that
a

carry
out
without

be
sophisticated
enough
to
avoid

anywhere
from
to
after
stricchiola
become
involve
yahoo
refund

but
google
decline
google

stance
left
the

who
be
now
pursue
a
lawsuit
against
its

with
hundred
of
thousand
of

of

stricchiola
be
convince
it
be

variety
click

she
add
that
numerous
other
click
fraud
case
of
advertiser
allege
wrongdoing
on
google
or
yahoo
have
be
settle
out
of
court
and
remain
under

i
be
aware
of
a
number
of
those
she
say
in
general
she
considers
yahoo
more
responsive
than
google
to
advertiser
complaint
about
click

google
be
notorious
for
just
flat
out
ignore
advertiser
she
say
google
say
thank
you
for
your
inquiry
we
see
no
problem
sometimes
google
do
not
even
look
at
the
data
and
they
give
the
most
ridiculous
explanation
yahoo
tends
to
be
more
proactive
that
be
because
they
have
the
people
more
so
than
google
to
really
look
at
this
stuff
this
be
why
some
advertiser
tear
their
hair
out
and
i
get
hire
to
help
people
and
create
a

at
what

look
at
as
a
purely
technological
issue
at
google
she
add
that
yahoo
share
data
about
click

with
advertiser
while
google
which
sometimes
sends
advertiser
refund
with
no

do
not
argue

it
do
not
want

about

method
that
could
fall
into
the
wrong
hand
and
lead

play
google
official
disagree
with
stricchiola
s
description
of
their
approach
to
address
click
fraud
we
believe
we
can
manage
click
spam
very
effectively
say
google
product
manager
salar
kamangar
use
the
term
spam
rather
than
fraud
to
make
the
point
that
not
all
questionable
click
be
malicious
in
intent
i
would
characterize
the
loss
due
to
click
fraud
as
small
he
say
we
have
a
software
system
that
filter
out
fraudulent
click
even
before
advertiser
get
bill
for
them
we
be
conservative
with
what
we
count
and
throw
out
anything
that
look
suspicious
we
also
have
a
team
of
engineer
and
be
constantly
look
for
way
to
update
the
software
we
also
have
a
team
of
specialist
investigate
report
from
customer
that
contact
us
and
let
us
know
they
think
there
be
a
problem
we
have
prosecute
a
case
of
this
but
this
becomes
more
difficult
across
border
so
our
main
focus
be
on
catch
it
in
the
first
place
detect
it
and
give
advertiser
the
tool
they
need
to
track
the
effectiveness
of
their
spending
and
the
possibility
of
any
click
fraud
in
the
case
of
lendingexpert
com
google
s
timely
reply
and
subsequent
refund
reveal
several
realty
of
click
base
advertising
and
its
risk
first
unlike
many
of
the
small
search
engine
google
responds
to
many
advertiser
who
claim
they
be
due
refund
from
allege
click
fraud
and
have
a
department
dedicate
to
work
on
specific
case
and
the
overall
problem
second
the
burden
of
proof
of
allege
click
fraud
rest
with
the
advertiser
not
with
the
search
engine
third
unlike
the
way
credit
card
company
respond
to
customer
take
them
at
their
word
and
prevent
them
from
be
bill
for
allegedly
fraudulent
charge
while
an
investigation
be
take
place
google
be
in
a
more
powerful
position
enable
it
to
collect
revenue
on
the
front
end
and
decide
later
whether
to
offer
refund
to
an
advertiser
that
make
a
claim
in

be
packed
with
hundred
of
eager
computer

and
their

by
the
time
eric

arrive
at
the

on
a
spring
afternoon
in

to

while

expert
compare
the
two
company
by

on
software
strategy

they
tend
to
overlook
the
primary
battleground
this
be
it
give
their
relative
strength
in
differ
business
and
technology
the
struggle
between
google
and
microsoft
be
not
primarily
about
market
share
browser
computer
operating
system
or
whether
only
one
of
the
two
company
ultimately
would
survive
the
real
battle
be
wag
be
over
recruiting
and
retain
the
brightest
technologist
in
the
world
this
be
the
key
variable
that
would
determine
which
company
have
the
great
capacity
to
identify
and
solve
the
most
interest
and
important
new
problem
in
the
internet
age
some
month
earlier
google
have
brazenly
open
an
office
in
kirkland
washington
not
far
from
microsoft
headquarters
where
it
have
succeed
in
lure
away
an
array
of
talented
software
engineer
who
want
to
work
for
google
but
continue
to
live
in
seattle
now
schmidt
found
himself
behind
enemy
line
inside
the
university
of
washington
s
paul
g
allen
center
for
computer

a
building
name
and
paid
for
by
microsoft
cofounder
paul
allen
schmidt
be
on
a
mission
he
be
determine
to
persuade
the
faculty
and
student
at
the
highly
regard
school
that
google
be
a
well
more
excite
place
to
work
these
day
than
microsoft
before
he
take
center
stage
schmidt
be
warmly
introduce
by
professor
ed
lazowska
who
held
the
bill
melinda
gate
chair
in
computer
science
engineering
at
the
university
and
whose
motto
be
if
you
re
not
part
of
the
steamroller
you
re
part
of
the
road
brimming
with
confidence
schmidt
be
fly
high
and
google
be
on
a
roll
its
stock
price
be
top
a
share
and
the
company
s
value
exceed
billion
the
main
question
from
his
perspective
seem
to
be
how
many
of
the
student
seat
before
him
would
want
to
join
google
on
its
historic
journey
for
month
and
even
earlier
that
same
day
in
another
venue
when
ask
about
compete
with
microsoft
schmidt
have
be
both
deferential
and
dismissive
say
microsoft
be
a
much
big
corporation
with
deeper
pocket
and
great
resource
and
that
any
comparison
with
google
be
silly
but
here
his
message
have
an
edge
google
be
the
best
place
on
earth
to
work
and
microsoft
be
an
age
giant
whose
best
day
be
behind
it
to
hear
the
world
accord
to
schmidt
the
company
lead
by
gate
be
root
in
an
earlier
phase
of
technology
that
have
be
surpass
by
the
power
of
the
internet
revolution
from
this
perspective
microsoft
matter
less
and
less
and
google
matter
more
and
more
you
be
play
on
a
much
big
stage
with
much
big
stake
he
say
then
schmidt
drove
in
the
dagger
we
compete
with
yahoo
every
day
he
say
microsoft
have
announce
their
entry
into
the
market
though
they
be
not
a
significant
competitor
yet
although
i
be
sure
they
will
try
twist
the
knife
far
schmidt
add
microsoft
have
publicly
announce
that
they
be
go
to
imbed
search
in
every
single
bit
there
be
on
a
pc
screen
so
that
be
go
to
be
their
entry
but
that
will
be
some
month
or
year
depend
on
what
schedule
you
assume
it
have
become
abundantly
clear
to
schmidt
that

be
reel
from
the
pressure
of

extraordinary

of

rashtchy
of

trajectory
this
way
welcome
to
microsoft
s
nightmare
that
afternoon
in
seattle
eric
schmidt
end
his
pugnacious
presentation
and
open
the
floor
for
question
from
faculty
and
student
at
the
university
of
washington
he
wasn
t
sure
what
to
expect
give
the
university
s
physical
proximity
to
microsoft
and
the
likelihood
that
some
of
the
computer
scientist
at
the
gathering
probably
have
work
or
intern
for
the
firm
or
have
their
tuition
paid
for
by
corporate
grant
of
course
google
itself
have
hire
more
than
undergraduate
from
the
school
and
at
least
ph
d
s
a
fraction
of
those
on
staff
at
microsoft
but
a
meaningful
number
in
a
short
period
of
year
schmidt
also
scan
the
room
with
interest
certain
that
microsoft
have
at
least
one
spy
on
hand
to
capture
his
every
word
and
to
take
note
of
the
audience
s
receptiveness
to
his
message
the
first
question
about
the
size
of
project
team
be
an
easy
one
google
do
its
best
work
on
numerous
initiative
in
team
of
three
to
five
people
with
their
leader
dubbed
utl
for
uber
team
leader
we
try
to
keep
it
small
you
just
don
t
get
productivity
out
of
large
group
schmidt
say
the
student
be
lob
him
softball
a
follow
up
question
dealt
with
the
pace
of
new
product
introduction
our
rate
of
innovation
be
significantly
faster
than
anyone
in
the
industry
and
significantly
faster
than
our
competitor
he
say
bluntly
know
how
much
computer
scientist
love
their
independence
schmidt
could
hardly
wait
to
answer
the
next
query
which
dealt
with
the
management
of
technologist
the
secret
here
be
not
the
way
we
manage
but
in
our
selection
of
the
people
he
say
this
model
work
when
you
have
the
right
people
it
would
be
a
complete
failure
in
an
organization
of
people
who
want
to
be
told
what
to
do
and
have
one
big
project
we
try
to
have
as
little
middle
management
as
possible
they
get
in
the
way
give
the
brainpower
in
the
room
schmidt
knew
it
be
inevitable
that
he
would
end
up
have
to
duck
some
question
like
the
one
that
come
next
ask
why
google
didn
t
provide
more
detail
about
how
its
business
really
make
money
so
that
analyst
could
build
model
and
project
its
future
profit
and
determine
if
its
stock
be
price
correctly
he
demur
we
have
decide
not
to
give
that
information
out
he
say
we
don
t
want
our
competitor
to
learn
it
we
have
invent
model
they
don
t
have
which
be
one
of
the
thing
that
be
drive
thing
so
quickly
from
a
revenue
perspective
then
he
get
another
layup
why
be
it
a
student
ask
that
google
didn
t
seek
to
make
money
from
its
popular
google
news
web
site
be
it
because
it
be
use
free
content
from
other
news
provider
just
what
be
the
reason
that
there
be
no
ad
google
news
be
a
very
successful
product
for
us
every
month
or
two
we
have
this
conversation
schmidt
say
google
news
be
easily
monetizeable
and
would
make
lot
of
money
the
team
come
in
and
asks
do
you
want
more
revenue
or
do
you
want
arabic
news
that
seem
like
a
no
brainer
we
want
arabic
news
there
be
only
about
country
eventually
we
will
run
out
of
this
and
then
we
will
work
on
monetization
now
predictably
come
the
harder
question
ask
what
social
impact
google
s
gathering
and
dissemination
of
the
world
s
information
would
have
schmidt
take
a
breather
we
don
t
know
he
say
i
personally
believe
the
right
model
be
to
think
of
all
the
world
s
information
in
the
equivalent
of
an
ipod
what
happens
when
you
be
carry
all
that
information
with
you
and
there
be
a
real
time
update
what
do
it
do
to
teach
when
every
student
can
do
the
answer
quicker
than
any
professor
can
get
it
out
of
his
or
her
mouth
then
come
a
tougher
query
google
a
student
say
have
no
product
to
sell
and
few
register
user
and
if
someone
come
along
with
a
well
technology
for
search
it
could
lose
its
follow
wasn
t
this
a
risky
way
to
run
a
business
our
business
have
relatively
little
lock
in
schmidt
concede
it
mean
our
competitiveness
be
search
by
search
person
by
person
we
understand
that
and
talk
about
that
a
lot
we
have
to
be
well
on
every
search
in
every
language
everywhere
in
the
world
next
someone
played
the
microsoft
card
ask
about
the
potential
for
get
caught
in
the
cross
fire
of
government
regulator
as
google
grows
large
and
more
powerful
and
competitor
have
an
incentive
to
spur
official
in
the
u
s
and
elsewhere
to
take
action
to
rein
in
the
company
s
runaway
growth
it
have
happen
to
gate
couldn
t
it
happen
to
google
it
be
a
problem
to
worry
about
schmidt
acknowledge
we
be
a
big
enough
force
now
that
people
pay
a
lot
of
attention
to
us
we
be
create
some
negative
wave
for
people
who
be
disenfranchise
or
unhappy
or
don
t
want
us
for
some
other
reason
i
think
it
be
go
to
get
bad
as
we
become
more
and
more
of
the
fabric
of
the
online
experience
schmidt
didn
t
want
to
end
the
session
on
such
a
dour
prospect
the
student
might
leave
with
the
feel
that
google
could
become
the
justice
department
s
next
antitrust
target
its
very
motto
don
t
be
evil
be
a
thinly
veil
way
of
let
the
technologist
of
the
world
know
that
larry
and
sergey
be
not
just
the
google
guy
but
the
good
guy
who
do
the
right
thing
for
user
and
for
employee
and
have
fun
too
they
weren
t
out
to
destroy
competitor
like
the
predator
described
in
the
massive
litigation
against
gate
and
microsoft
schmidt
imply
he
be
fond
of
say
that
google
have
no
real
enemy
as
luck
would
have
it
schmidt
be
ask
about
the
company
s
role
as
a
gatekeeper
of
online
information
for
web
site
that
might
want
to
charge
for
their
content
though
he
generally
refrain
from
talk
about
product
in
the
pipeline
schmidt
saw
this
as
an
opportunity
to
take
the
student
into
his
confidence
and
make
them
feel
like
google
insider
it
be
a
classic
traditional
recruiting
technique
he
have
use
successfully
before
we
have
built
and
be
in
the
process
of
building
what
we
call
proprietary
content
distribution
schmidt
say
the
vast
majority
of
the
money
go
to
the
content
provider
we
keep
a
fee
for
provide
the
billing
relationship
then
he
expand
on
the
firm
s
role
as
the
gateway
to
the
internet
google
be
likely
to
be
if
not
the
one
of
the
large
place
people
come
from
from
the
standpoint
of
be
an
information
publisher
so
you
will
want
to
work
with
us
we
hope
we
would
be
the
large
traffic
generator
to
you
as
a
publisher
we
think
that
be
good
chapter
money
machine
as
google
s
stock
price
climbed
a
major
question
loom
among
investor
be
this
a
great
stock
to
buy
or
a
dangerous
high
wire
act
wall
street
commentator
and
expert
caution
investor
to
keep
their
distance
google
the
search
engine
be
everywhere
but
google
the
stock
be
difficult
to
understand
an
enigma
of
sort
away
from
the
herd
on
the
street
however
an
independent
mind
investment
guru
have
other
idea
baltimore
s
bill
miller
ran
the
vaunt
legg
mason
value
trust
a
mutual
fund
that
have
outperform
the
stock
market
for
consecutive
year
put
him
in
a
league
of
his
own
a
portly
man
nearly
twice
the
age
of
google
s
founder
who
have
once
study
philosophy
miller
look
for
young
company
with
sustainable
competitive
advantage
that
would
lead
to
enormous
growth
and
profit
in
the
long
run
then
he
make
big
bet
on
those
firm
when
miller
look
at
google
s
financial
statement
in
the
walk
up
to
the
ipo
he
saw
a
high
octane
money
machine
power
by
a
search
engine
for
a
young
company
google
be
a
big
time
moneymaker
that
have
competitive
advantage
and
enormous
long
term
potential
it
already
be
earn
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
annually
its
sale
be
skyrocket
and
it
be
in
its
infancy
the
firm
be
get
big
and
big
faster
and
faster
google
have
make
so
much
money
so
quickly
that
it
have
no
debt
even
sweeter
its
profit
depend
on
internet
advertising
an
expand
pie
as
people
spent
more
time
online
business
sought
to
reach
them
on
the
internet
we
be
delighted
when
the
so
call
fud
factor
fear
uncertainty
doubt
dominate
the
process
result
in
the
share
come
at
the
bargain
price
of
value
the
company
at
billion
roughly
miller
say
there
be
the
news
flow
about
the
deal
how
the
founder
be
arrogant
and
inexperienced
how
the
dual
class
share
structure
smack
of
bad
corporate
governance
how
the
company
would
not
provide
enough
information
about
its
business
how
it
refuse
to
give
guidance
on
future
prospect
and
so
on
the
noise
drove
the
price
of
google
s
ipo
down
but
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
long
term
growth
and
profit
potential
of
the
business
in
fact
as
miller
say
we
believe
this
create
an
opportunity
under
miller
s
direction
legg
mason
have
bought
more
than
four
million
google
share
in
the
ipo
spending
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
to
amass
a
big
stake
no
stranger
to
the
internet
miller
s
celebrate
fund
already
have
major
holding
in
amazon
com
and
ebay
two
best
of
breed
firm
that
would
soon
celebrate
their
tenth
anniversary
as
dot
com
star
for
the
average
investor
who
couldn
t
read
a
financial
statement
one
of
the
easy
way
to
make
money
in
stock
be
to
copy
the
move
of
an
investment
genius
for
anyone
who
want
to
know
whether
to
purchase
google
stock
soon
after
the

miller
s
mammoth
purchase
publicly
disclose
in
the
fall
of

a

signal
while
others
scratch
their
head
bill
miller
have
confidence
in
google
s
ad
model
advertising
be
undergo
an
enormous
shift
as
billion
of
dollar
move
from
traditional
medium
to
the
online
world
and
google
more
than
any
other
company
have
figure
out
how
to
profit
in
multiple
way
in
this
new
landscape
make
it
a
technology
company
with
a
robust
business
broadcast
television
magazine
and
newspaper
have
for
decade
be
fuel
by
advertising
and
have
be
great
moneymaker
google
be
no
different
miller
reason
just
because
this
be
the
internet
many
wrongly
associate
google
stock
with
the
high
fly
firm
of
silicon
valley
s
boom
and
bust
era
several
year
earlier
back
then
some
internet
firm
report
plenty
of
ad
revenue
too
but
that
be
mostly
from
ad
purchase
by
other
internet
firm
in
contrast
google
s
ad
dollar
come
primarily
from
thousand
of
small
and
medium
size
business
many
of
which
hadn
t
advertised
on
the
web
before
these
be
a
mix
of
online
enterprise
and
traditional
brick
and
mortar
firm
amazon
and
ebay
both
be
big
advertiser
on
google
buying
target
ad
that
would
send
thousand
of
computer
user
to
their
well
establish
web
site
google
be
also
avoid
the
kind
of
ad
that
computer
user
hat
it
be
profit
instead
from
text
ad
trigger
by
search
in
a
sense
what
it
have
master
be
the
reverse
of
mass
market
advertising
search
and
surf
the
web
with
google
power
ad
be
akin
to
drive
down
a
highway
and
see
only
billboard
that
directly
related
to
what
you
be
think
or
discuss
at
that
moment
the
scale
of
google
s
business
model
with
the
world
s
best
hardware

it
be
impressive
even
as
it

analyst
be
left
to
grapple
with
question
on
their
own
what
kind
of
quarterly

would
google
report
especially
since
the
company
have
say
that
it
be
manage
strictly
for
the

how
would
the

absorb
all

during

what
about
the

google

not

to
something

the

grow
even
if
it
remain
extremely
profitable
there
eventually
would
come
a
time
when
its

remain

to

some
wall

skeptic
pin
a

label
on

they
call
it
a
one
trick

by

they

have
to

upward
as

for

to
get
a
clear
idea
of

real
value
of

because
the

steadfastly
refuse

any
guidance
on
february
google
open
its
door
for
the
first

financial
analyst
who
travel
to
silicon

for
the
chance
to
meet
larry

and
the
executive
team
this
be
only
day
before
the
additional
million
google
share
be
to
become
available
for
trading
and
the
goal
of
the
session
be
to
provide
more
information
at
what
ceo
eric
schmidt
recognize
be
a
critical
juncture
he
understood
the
importance
of
google
opening
up
a
bit
and
of
make
it
through
valentine
s
day
without
a
stock
market
event
that
might
shake
confidence
in
the
company
the
day
open
with
reassure
word
from
schmidt
the
advertising
network
be
a
beautiful
thing
to
behold
he
say
we
have
a
wonderfully
diverse
set
of
advertiser
we
re
not
reliant
on
any
particular
category
or
advertiser
to
some
overwhelm
regard
part
of
it
be
because
of
this
concept
call
the
long
tail
he
go
on
this
be
the
idea
that
in
the
internet
age
geography
matter
less
as
low
cost
distribution
enable
niche
product
catering
to
very
specific
taste
to
attract
large
audience
it
turn
out
that
the
most
popular
book
music
and
movie
make
up
a
surprisingly
modest
proportion
of
sale
for
amazon
netflix
and
other
retailer
the
rest
come
from
a
long
tail
of
obscure
favorite
that
the
internet
have
make
easy
to
find
in
google
s
case
the
concept
apply
to
the
unexpectedly
wide
array
of
business
that
bought
advertising
on
the
search
engine
the
surprising
thing
about
the
long
tail
be
how
long
the
long
part
of
the
tail
really
be
and
how
many
small
business
there
be
that
have
not
have
access
to
the
mass
market
schmidt
say
we
re
do
pretty
well
in
the
middle
of
the
tail
we
still
do
not
have
all
the
product
and
service
that
in
our
judgment
be
really
need
to
serve
the
large
advertiser
or
the
very
tiniest
of
advertiser
we
want
to
make
sure
we
serve
this
whole
space
very
very
well
and
that
be
all
stuff
under
development
schmidt
s
word
make
it
clear
that
google
s
advertising
and
business
model
have
plenty
of
room
for
growth
and
also
that
the
firm
plan
to
go
after
deep
pocket
fortune
advertiser
in
we
be
not
quite
as
unconventional
as
we
actually
say
all
the
time
he
say
the
thing
that
we
do
be
unique
in
the
way
that
product
be
create
but
much
of
the
rest
of
the
business
be
run
in
all
the
normal
way
and
very
much
at
the
state
of
the
art
but
in
a
traditional
way
we
actually
do
care
about
objective
every
quarter
we
go
through
how
be
we
do
so
google
do
care
about
its
financial
result
after
all
it
be
simply
that
with
so
many
brilliant
engineer
and
mathematician
it
go
about
the
process
of
innovation
in
way
that
be
more
like
a
university
than
a
business
as
for
management
and
financial
resource
schmidt
explain
they
be
allocate
by
that
he
meant
that
percent
be
put
into
core
search
and
advertising
percent
be
put
into
adjacent
product
and
percent
be
invest
in
totally
new
idea
the
vision
of
thing
to
come
you
have
to
work
on
your
core
business
because
that
be
the
thing
that
brings
in
the
cash
flow
the
customer
the
business
he
say
as
for
the
percent
we
have
a
very
sophisticated
set
of
product
manager
and
technology
leader
who
understand
how
to
take
some
of
these
brilliant
idea
and
turn
them
into
business
have
heard
precisely
what
they
need
to
hear
from
schmidt
the
analyst
now
wait
for
the
founder
to
offer
their
view
notwithstanding
the
reassurance
from
schmidt
the
guy
remain

its

otherwise

intrinsic
to
their
success
if

two
thousand
a

by
june
google

be
the

be
flirt
with

make
the

worth
more
than

overshadow
the
honor
bestow

when

would
hit
no
company
be

google
the
financial
time

take
only
a
tiny
mishap
or
flatten

growth
for

plummet
do
that

probably
not

long
as

remains

it
show
every

of
do
a

anybody
who

never

whether

it

the

for

be
among
the
possible
outcome
just
think
of
the
application
of
google
to
genomics
say
hennessy
there
be
large
database
lot
of
information
and
the
need
for
search
with
the
addition
of
specialized

he
say
google
s
index
could
aid
in
new
discovery
in

you
want
to
be
able
to
use
a

system
that
be
content
dependent
with
the
genome

already

be
one
of
many
potential
area
where
you
can
see
this
so
call
intelligent
search
make
a
big

we
be
go
to

more
and
more
of
it
dr
alan
e
guttmacher
deputy
director
of
the
national
human
genome
research
institute
say
google
s
involvement
in
genetics
be
particularly
meaningful
because
of
its
capacity
to
search
and
find
specific
gene
and
genetic
abnormality
that
cause
disease
he
also
say
that
its
massive

be
use
to
analyze
vast
quantity
of

that

the
old
model
of
a
scientist
work
in
a

he
say
be
be
replace

of
a

work
at

connect
to

until

the
challenge
have
be
gathering

guttmacher
say
now
the
big
challenge
be
organize

assess
it
google

the
key
to

even
the

role
that
google
can
play
in
enhance
the
ability
for
cellular
biologist
and
other
kind
of
medical
researcher
to
be
able
to
start
to
use
data
cluster
like
we
have
at
google
and
certainly
like
the
one
we
re
go
to
have
in
a
decade
or
two
decade
time
and
be
able
to
do
completely
new
thing
that
we
weren
t
able
to
dream
of
before
the
implication
could
be
significant
for
individual
while
genetics
do
not
necessarily
provide
yes
or
no
answer
to
various
medical
and
other
question
it
do
offer
probability
and
statistic
that
can
guide
decision
make
people
will
be
able
to
log
on
to
a
google
site
use
search
capacity
and
have
the
ability
to
understand
thing
about
themselves
as
they
change
in
real
time
venter
say
what
do
it
mean
to
have
this
variation
in
gene
what
else
be
know
and
instead
of
have
a
few
elitist
scientist
do
this
and
dictate
to
the
world
what
it
mean
with
google
it
would
be
create
several
million
scientist
google
have
empower
individual
to
do
search
and
get
information
and
have
thing
in
second
at
their
fingertip
he
go
on
where
be
that
more
important
than
understand
our
own
biology
and
its
connection
to
disease
and
behavior
with
google
you
will
be
able
to
get
an
understand
of
your
own
gene
google
have
the
capacity
to
do
all
of
this
and
it
be
one
of
the
discussion
i
have
have
with
larry
and
sergey
they
be
the
right
people
to
undertake
this
stewart
brand
a
technologist

futurist
who
be
also
at
the

described
the

of
these
maverick
as
a

make
in

venter
may
have

venter
say
he

ask

page
explain
i
have
a
good
friend
who
really
want
to
go
to
mar
and
so
he
decide
he
should
build
a
rocket
company
he
have
be
pretty
successful
about
it
i
just
sent
him
an
email
and
i
ask
him
for
some
stats
so
what
be
the
theoretical
cost
of
get
a
pound
of
something
into
space
it
s
basically
the
fuel
that
power
the
rocket
into
orbit
the
space
shuttle
cost
about
to
per
pound
that
it
carry
up
what
do
you
think
the
theoretical
low
limit
be
it
s
actually
about
to
per
pound
to
move
something
into
orbit
for
you
or
your
body
that
s
probably
the
cost
of
an
expensive
airplane
ticket
right
do
you
think
someday
we
might
figure
out
how
to
get
close
to
that
i
think
we
could
that
would
change
thing
a
lot
and
might
get
us
to
mar
back
on
earth
page
also
foresees
great
involvement
for
himself
and
google
in
cause
that
work
to
relieve
hunger
and
poverty
through
entrepreneurship
self
reliance
and
philanthropy
he
have
take
a
particular
interest
in
program
that
provide
small
bank
loan
to
people
in
develop
nation
mohammed
yunus
in
bangladesh
have
give
out
over
billion
now
at
a
time
to
poor
people
and
be
very
successful
he
say
the
money
get
return
and
it
be
a
function
business
he
add
i
believe
eliminate
poverty
be
something
we
could
do
bono
be
actually
more
eloquent
than
i
be
on
this
so
i
ll
read
you
a
quote
from
him
africa
be
not
a

it
be
an

among
the

would
like
to
see

achieve
in
the

be
the

this

the

that

google

then
there
be
the
personal
experience
that
have
make
patrinos
a
major
google

i
have
found
colleague
i
hadn
t
see
in

one
guy
be
in
nigeria
one
guy
be
in

another

i
wouldn

have
found
them
any

way
google
have
other
friend
in
washington

and
it
will
need
them
as
it
grows
large
and
branch
out
power
and
size
breed
mistrust
so
inevitably
there
be
call
from
competitor
and
others
for
regulation
and
restriction
google
have
already
encounter
hostile

fear
it

as
well
as
its

these

question
from
individual
look
for
information
and
terry
and
her
staff
use
google
and
google
scholar
throughout
the
workday
to
help
find
answer
she
remembers
how
much
harder
it
be
a
decade
ago
when
search
engine
lack
google
s
comprehensiveness
and
ability
to
rank
search
result
by
relevance
nothing
else
meet
the
depth
of
google
to
hone
in
on
exactly
the
right
information
terry
say
our
work
be
connect
the
dot
and
google
connects
the
dot
wonderfully
we
may
meet
someone
who
say
i
have
a
concern
about
a
certain
condition
and
often
we
do
a
google
search
first
i
remember
ten
year
ago
when
site
didn
t
have
good
index
and
you
have
to
wade
through
crap
to
get
to
the
nut
you
need
we
have
grown
our
organization
and
ability
to
do
what
we
need
to
do
exponentially
in
a
way
that
be
attributable
to
the
internet
and
good
search
engine
like
google
i
can
t
imagine
google
not
exist
brin
and
page
want
to
make
it
even
easy
for
terry
to
find
the
information
she
need
their
ambition
and
at
time
seemingly
crazy
idea
go
far
beyond
google
alone
people
around
the
world
may
see
google
and
the
internet
as
one
these
day
but
brin
and
page
foresee
the
potential
for
human
being
and
the
search
engine
to
grow
ever
closer
why
not
improve
the
brain
brin
ask
you
would
want
a
lot
of
compute
power
perhaps
in
the
future
we
can
attach
a
little
version
of
google
that
you
just
plug
into
your
brain
we
ll
have
to
develop
stylish
version
but
then
you
d
have
all
of
the
world
s
knowledge
immediately
available
which
be
pretty
excite
