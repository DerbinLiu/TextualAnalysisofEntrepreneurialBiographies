
introduction
one
wintry
afternoon
in
february
three
men
be
engage
in
earnest
conversation
in
london
from
that
conversation
be
to
flow
consequence
of
the
great
importance
to
the
british
empire
and
to
the
world
as
a
whole
for
these
men
be
organize
a
secret
society
that
be
for
more
than
fifty
year
to
be
one
of
the
most
important
force
in
the
formulation
and
execution
of
british
imperial
and
foreign
policy
the
three
men
who
be
thus
engage
be
already
well
know
in
england
the
leader
be
cecil
rhodes
fabulously
wealthy
empirebuilder
and
the
most
important
person
in
south
africa
the
second
be
william
t
stead
the
most
famous
and
probably
also
the
most
sensational
journalist
of
the
day
the
third
be
reginald
baliol
brett
later
know
as
lord
esher
friend
and
confidant
of
queen
victoria
and
later
to
be
the
most
influential
adviser
of
king
edward
vii
and
king
george
v
the
detail
of
this
important
conversation
will
be
examine
later
at
present
we
need
only
point
out
that
the
three
drew
up
a
plan
of
organization
for
their
secret
society
and
a
list
of
original
member
the
plan
of
organization
provide
for
an
inner
circle
to
be
know
as
the
society
of
the
elect
and
an
outer
circle
to
be
know
as
the
association
of
helper
within
the
society
of
the
elect
the
real
power
be
to
be
exercise
by
the
leader
and
a
junta
of
three
the
leader
be
to
be
rhodes
and
the
junta
be
to
be
stead
brett
and
alfred
milner
in
accordance
with
this
decision
milner
be
add
to
the
society
by
stead
shortly
after
the
meeting
we
have
described
the
creation
of
this
secret
society
be
not
a
matter
of
a
moment
as
we
shall
see
rhodes
have
be
planning
for
this
event
for
more
than
seventeen
year
stead
have
be
introduce
to
the
plan
on
april
and
brett
have
be
told
of
it
on
february
nor
be
the
society
thus
found
an
ephemeral
thing
for
in
modify
form
it
exists
to
this
day
from
to
it
be
know
to
only
a
score
of
per

son
during
this
period
rhodes
be
leader
and
stead
be
the
most
influential
member
from
to
milner
be
leader
while
philip
kerr
lord
lothian
and
lionel
curtis
be
probably
the
most
important
member
from
to
kerr
be
leader
and
since
his
death
in
this
role
have
probably
be
played
by
robert
henry
brand
now
lord
brand
during
this
period
of
almost
sixty
year
this
society
have
be
call
by
various
name
during
the
first
decade
or
so
it
be
call
the
secret
society
of
cecil
rhodes
or
the
dream
of
cecil
rhodes
in
the
second
and
third
decade
of
its
existence
it
be
know
as
milner
kindergarten
and
as
the
round
table
group
since
it
have
be
call
by
various
name
depend
on
which
phase
of
its
activity
be
be
examine
it
have
be
call
the
time
crowd
the
rhodes
crowd
the
chatham
house
crowd
the
all
soul
group
and
the
cliveden
set
all
of
these
term
be
more
or
less
inadequate
because
they
focus
attention
on
only
part
of
the
society
or
on
only
one
of
its
activity
the
milner
kindergarten
and
the
round
table
group
for
example
be
two
different
name
for
the
association
of
helper
and
be
thus
only
part
of
the
society
since
the
real
center
of
the
organization
the
society
of
the
elect
continued
to
exist
and
recruit
new
member
from
the
outer
circle
as
seem
necessary
since
this
group
have
be
increasingly
dominate
by
the
associate
of
viscount
astor
in
the
s
the
misname
cliveden
set
be
close
to
the
center
of
the
society
but
it
would
be
entirely
unfair
to
believe
that
the
connotation
of
superficiality
and
conspiracy
popularly
associate
with
the
expression
cliveden
set
be
a
just
description
of
the
milner
group
as
a
whole
in
fact
viscount
astor
be
relatively
speak
a
late
addition
to
the
society
and
the
society
should
rather
be
picture
as
utilize
the
astor
money
to
far
their
own
ideal
rather
than
as
be
use
for
any
purpose
by
the
master
of
cliveden
even
the
expression
rhodes
secret
society
which
would
be
perfectly
accurate
in
reference
to
the
period
would
hardly
be
accurate
for
the
period
after
the
organization
be
so
modify
and
so
expand
by
milner
after
the
eclipse
of
stead
in
and
especially
after
the
death
of
rhodes
in
that
it
take
on
quite
a
different
organization
and
character
although
it
continued
to
pursue
the
same
goal
to
avoid
this
difficulty
we
shall
generally
call
the
organization
the
rhodes
secret
society
before
and
the
milner
group
after
this
date
but
it
must
be
understood
that
both
term
refer
to
the
same
organization
this
organization
have
be
able
to
conceal
its
existence
quite
successfully
and
many
of
its
most
influential
member
satisfied
to
posse
the
reality
rather
than
the
appearance
of
power
be
unknown
even
to
close
student
of
british
history
this
be
the
more
surprising
when
we
learn
that
one
of
the
chief
method
by
which
this
group
work
have
be
through
propaganda
it
plot
the
jameson
raid
of
it
cause
the
boer
war
of
it
set
up
and
control
the
rhodes
trust
it
create
the
union
of
south
africa
in
it
establish
the
south
african
periodical
the
state
in
it
found
the
british
empire
periodical
the
round
table
in
and
this
remains
the
mouthpiece
of
the
group
it
have
be
the
most
powerful
single
influence
in
all
soul
balliol
and
new
college
at
oxford
for
more
than
a
generation
it
have
control
the
time
for
more
than
fifty
year
with
the
exception
of
the
three
year
it
publicize
the
idea
of
and
the
name
british
commonwealth
of
nation
in
the
period
it
be
the
chief
influence
in
lloyd
george
war
administration
in
and
dominate
the
british
delegation
to
the
peace
conference
of
it
have
a
great
deal
to
do
with
the
formation
and
management
of
the
league
of
nation
and
of
the
system
of
mandate
it
found
the
royal
institute
of
international
affair
in
and
still
control
it
it
be
one
of
the
chief
influence
on
british
policy
toward
ireland
palestine
and
india
in
the
period
it
be
a
very
important
influence
on
the
policy
of
appeasement
of
germany
during
the
year
and
it
control
and
still
control
to
a
very
considerable
extent
the
source
and
the
write
of
the
history
of
british
imperial
and
foreign
policy
since
the
boer
war
it
would
be
expect
that
a
group
which
could
number
among
its
achievement
such
accomplishment
as
these
would
be
a
familiar
subject
for
discussion
among
student
of
history
and
public
affair
in
this
case
the
expectation
be
not
realize
partly
because
of
the
deliberate
policy
of
secrecy
which
this
group
have
adopt
partly
because
the
group
itself
be
not
closely
integrate
but
rather
appear
as
a
series
of
overlap
circle
or
ring
partly
conceal
by
be
hidden
behind
formally
organize
group
of
no
obvious
political
significance
this
group
held
together
as
it
be
by
the
tenuous
link
of
friendship
personal
association
and
common
ideal
be
so
indefinite
in
its
outline
especially
in
recent
year
that
it
be
not
always
possible
to
say
who
be
a
member
and
who
be
not
indeed
there
be
no
sharp
line
of
demarkation
between
those
who
be
member
and
those
who
be
not
since
membership
be
possess
in
vary
degree
and
the
degree
change
at
different
time
sir
alfred
zimmern
for
example
while
always
close
to
the
group
be
in
its
inner
circle
only
for
a
brief
period
in
thereafter
slowly
drift
away
into
the
outer
orbit
o
the
group
lord
halifax
on
the
other
hand
while
close
to
it
from
do
not
really
become
a
member
until
after
viscount
astor
also
close
to
the
group
from
its
first
beginning
and
much
closer
than
halifax
move
rapidly
to
the
center
of
the
group
after
and
especially
after
and
in
later
year
become
increasingly
a
decisive
voice
in
the
group
although
the
membership
of
the
milner
group
have
slowly
shift
with
the
passing
year
the
group
still
reflect
the
characteristic
of
its
chief
leader
and
through
him
the
ideological
orientation
of
balliol
in
the
s
although
the
group
do
not
actually
come
into
existence
until
its
history
cover
a
much
longer
period
since
its
origin
go
back
to
about
this
history
can
be
divide
into
four
period
of
which
the
first
from
to
could
be
call
the
preparatory
period
and
center
about
the
figure
of
w
t
stead
and
alfred
milner
the
second
period
from
to
could
be
call
the
rhodes
period
although
stead
be
the
chief
figure
for
most
of
it
the
third
period
from
to
could
be
call
the
new
college
period
and
center
about
alfred
milner
the
fourth
period
from
about
to
the
present
could
be
call
the
all
soul
period
and
center
about
lord
lothian
lord
brand
and
lionel
curtis
during
these
four
period
the
group
grow
steadily
in
power
and
influence
until
about
it
be
badly
split
on
the
policy
of
appeasement
after
march
and
receive
a
rude
jolt
from
the
general
election
of
until
however
the
expansion
in
power
of
the
group
be
fairly
consistent
this
growth
be
base
on
the
possession
by
its
member
of
ability
social
connection
and
wealth
it
be
not
possible
to
distinguish
the
relationship
of
these
three
quality
a
not
uncommon
situation
in
england
milner
be
able
to
dominate
this
group
because
he
become
the
focus
or
rather
the
intersection
point
of
three
influence
these
we
shall
call
the
toynbee
group
the
cecil
bloc
and
the
rhodes
secret
society
the

intellectual
form

balliol
about

by
arnold

from
the
great
sphere
of
politics
into
the
field
of

the
economic

of
south
africa
to
extend
and
perpetuate
the
british
empire
it
be
doubtful
i
milner
could
have
form
his
group
without
assistance
from
all
three
of
these
source
the
toynbee
group
give
him
the
ideology

the
personal
loyalty

he
need
the
cecil
bloc
give
him
the
political
influence
without
which
his
idea
could
easily
have
die
in
the
seed
and
the
rhodes
secret
society
give
him
the
economic
resource
which
make
it
possible
for
him
to
create
his
own
group
independent
o
the
cecil
bloc
by
when
the
leadership
o
the
cecil
bloc
have
fall
from
the
masterful
grasp
of

indifferent

long
period
of
liberal
government
which
begin
in
cast
a
temporary
cloud
over
that
future
but
by
the
milner
group
have
make
its
entrance
into
the
citadel
of
political
power
and
for
the
next
twenty
three
year
steadily

its
influence

by
it

the
most

all
three
played
role
in

own
little
circle
at

the
dominant
position

held
by

in
spite
of
his
early
death
in
toynbee
idea
and
outlook
continue
to
influence
the
milner
group
to
the
present
day
as
milner
say
in
there
be
many
men
now
active
in
public
life
and
some
whose
best
work
be
probably
yet
to

work
out
idea
inspire
by
him
as
to
toynbee
influence
on

himself
the
latter
speak
of
his
first
meeting
with
toynbee
in
say
twenty
one
year
later
i
feel
at
once
under
his
spell
and
have
always
remain
under
it
no
one
who
be
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
the
milner
group
can
possibly
see
the
truth
of
these
quotation
and
as
a
result
the
thousand
of
person
who
have
read
these
statement
in
the
introduction
to
toynbee
s
famous
lecture
on
the
industrial
revolution
have
be
vaguely
puzzle
by
milner
insistence
on
the
importance
of
a
man
who
die
at
such
an
early
age
and
so
long
ago
most
reader
have
merely
dismiss
the
statement
as
sentimentality
inspire
by
personal
attachment
although
it
should
be
clear
that
alfred
milner
be
about
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
display
sentimentality
or
even
sentiment
among
the
idea
of
toynbee
which
influence
the
milner
group
we
should
mention
three
a
a
conviction
that
the
history
of
the
british
empire
represent
the
unfold
of
a
great
moral
idea
the
idea
of
freedom
and
that
the
unity
of
the
empire
could
best
be
preserve
by
the
cement
of
this
idea
b
a
conviction
that
the
first
call
on
the
attention
o
any
man
should
be
a
sense
of
duty
and
obligation
to
serve
the
state
and
c
a
feel
of
the
necessity
to
do
social
service
work
especially
educational
work
among
the
work
class
o
english
society
these
idea
be
accepted
by
most
o
the
men
whose
name
we
have
already
mention
and
become
dominant
principle
of
the
milner
group
later
toynbee
can
also
be
regard
as
the
founder
of
the
method
use
by
the
group
later
especially
in
the
round
table
group
and
in
the
royal
institute
of
international
affair

one
of
the
instrument
by
which
the

group
merge
with
all
soul
but
more
important
than
this
goschen
introduce
milner
in
the
period
into
that
extraordinary
circle
which
rotate
about
the
cecil
family

the
cecil
bloc
the
milner
group
could
never
have
be
built
up
by
milner
own
effort
he
have
no
political
power
or
even
influence
all
that
he
have
be
ability
and
idea
the
same
thing
be
true
about
many
of
the
other
member
of
the
milner
group
at
least
at
the
time
that
they
join
the
group
the
power
that
be
utilized
by
milner
and
his
group
be
really
the
power
of
the
cecil
family
and
its
allied
family
such
as
the
lyttelton
viscount
cobham
wyndham
baron
leconfield

gathorne
hardy
earl

brook
the
milner
group
be
originally
a
major
fief
within
the
great
nexus
of
power
influence
and
privilege
control
by
the
cecil
family
it
be
not
possible
to
describe
here
the
ramification
of
the
cecil
influence
it
have
be
all
pervasive
in
british
life
since
this
cecil
bloc
be
built
up
by
robert
arthur
talbot
gascoyne
cecil
viscount
cranborne
and
third
marquess
of
salisbury
the
method
use
by
this
man
be
merely
copy
by
the
milner
group
these
method
can
be
sum
up
under
three
heading
a
a
triple
front
penetration
in
politics
education
and
journalism
b
the
recruitment
f
men
of
ability
chiefly
from
all
soul
and
the
link
of
these
men
to
the
cecil
bloc
by
matrimonal
alliance
and
by
gratitude
for
title
and
position
of
power
and
c
the
influence
of
public
policy
by
place
member
of
the
cecil
bloc
in
position
of
power
shield
as
much
as
possible
from
public
attention
the
triple
front
penetration
can
be
see
in
lord
salisbury
own
life
he
be
not
only
prime

a
longer

extent
by
the
shift

most
o
these
person
be
elect
to
fellowship
in

at
the
age
of
twenty
two
or
twenty
three
year
at
a
time
when
their
great
exploit
be
yet
in
the
future
there
be
some
question
whether
this
ability
of
the
fellow
of
all
soul
to
elect
as
their
young
colleague
men
with
brilliant
future
be
to
be
explain
by
their
ability
to
discern
greatness
at
an
early
age
or
by
the
fact
that
election
to
the
fellowship
open
the
door
to
achievement
in
public
affair
there
be
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
second
of
these
two
alternative
be
of
great
weight
as
the
biographer
of
viscount
halifax
have
put
it
it
be
safe
to
assert
that
the
fellow
o
all
soul
be
a
man
marked
out
for
a
position
of
authority
in
public
life
and
there
be
no
surprise
if
he
reach
the
summit
of
power
but
only
disappointment
if
he
fall
short
o
the
opportunity
that
be
set
out
before
him
one
fellow
of
all
soul
have
confess
in
a
publish
work
that
his
career
be
base
on
his
membership
in
this
college
the
right
reverend
herbert
hensley
henson
who
rise
from
humble
origin
to
become
bishop
of
durham
write
in
his
memoir
my
election
to
a
fellowship
against
all
probability
and
certainly
against
all
expectation
have
decisive
influence
on
my
subsequent
career
it
brought
me
within
the
knowledge
o
the
late
lord
salisbury
who
subsequently
recommend
me
to
the
crown
for
appointment
to
a
canonry
of
westminister
it
be
to
all
soul
college
that
all
the
success
of
my
career
be
mainly
due
it
would
appear
that
the
college
of
all
soul
be
largely
influence
not
by
the
illustrious
person
whose
name
we
have
list
above
since
they
be
generally
busy
elsewhere
but
by
another
group
within
the
college
this
appear
when
we
realize
that
the
fellow
whose
fellowship
be
renew
for
one
appointment
after
another
be
not
generally
the
one
with
famous
name
the
realization
be
increase
when
we
see
that
these
person
with
the
power
to
obtain
renew
appointment
be
member
of
a
shadowy
group
with
common
undergraduate
association
close
personal
relationship
similar
interest
and
idea
and
surprisingly
similar
biographical
experience
it
be
this
shadowy
group
which
include
the
all
soul
member
of
the
milner
group
in
the
nineteenth
century
lord
salisbury
make
little
effort
to
influence
all
soul
although
it
be
a
period
when
influence
especially
in
election
to
fellowship
be
more
important
than
later
he
content
himself
with
recruiting
protege
from
the
college
and
apparently
left
the
wield
of
influence
to
others
especially
to
sir
william
anson
in
the
twentieth
century
the
milner
group
have
recruit
from
and
influence
all
soul
this
influence
have
not
extend
to
the
election
to
the
twenty
one
competitive
fellowship
there
merit
have
unquestionably
be
the
decisive
factor
but
it
have
be
exercise
in
regard
to
the
seventeen
ex
officio
fellowship
the
ten
distinguish
person
fellowship
and
the
twelve
reelective
fellowship
and
it
have
also
be
important
in
contribute
to
the
general
direction
and
policy
o
the
college
this
do
not
mean
that
the
milner
group
be
identical
with
all
soul
but
merely
that
it
be
the
chief
if
not
the
control
influence
in
it
especially
in
recent
year
many
member
of
the
milner
group
be
not
member
of
all
soul
and
many
member
of
all
soul
be
not
member
o
the
milner
group
the
fact
that
all
soul
be
influence
by
some
outside
power
have
be
recognize
by
others
but
no
one
so
far
as
i
know
have
succeed
in
identify
this
influence
the
erratic
christopher
hobhouse
in
his
recent
book
on
oxford
have
come
closer
than
most
when
he
write
the
senior
common
room
at
all
soul
be
distinguish
above
all
others
by
the
great
brain
which
meet
there
and
by
the
singular
unfruitfulness
of
their
collaboration
but
it
be
not
these
who
make
the
run
rather
be
it
the
editor
of
the
time
and
his
circle
of
associate
men
whom
the
public
voice
have
call
to
no
office
and
entrust
with
no
responsibility
these
individual
elect
to
consider
themselves
the
power
behind
the
scene
the
duty
of
purvey
honest
news
be
elevate
in
their
eye
into
the
prerogative
of
dictate
opinion
it
be
at
all
soul
that
they
meet
to
decide
just
how
little
they
will
let
their
reader
know
and
their
newspaper
have
be
call
the
all

parish
magazine
s
the
inaccuracy
and
bitterness
of
this
statement
be
cause
by
the
scorn
which
a
devotee
of
the
humanity
feel
toward
the
practitioner
of
the
social
science
but
the
writer
be
shrewd
enough
to
see
that
an
outside
group
dominates
all

he
be
also
able
to
see
the
link
between
all

and
the

although
quite
mistaken
in
his
conclusion
that
the

for

considerable
period
by

it
do
not
however
continue
to
grow
but
on
the
contrary
become
looser
and
less
discipline
for
balfour
lack
the
quality
of
ambition
and
determination
necessary
to
control
or
develop
such
a
group
accordingly
the
cecil
bloc
while
still
in
existence
as
a
political
and
social
power
have
largely
be
replace
by
the
milner
group
this
group
which
begin
as
a
dependent
fief
of
the
cecil
bloc
have
since
become
increasingly
the
active
portion
of
the
bloc
and
in
fact
its
real
center
milner
possess
those
quality
of
determination
and
ambition
which
balfour
lack
and
be
willing
to
sacrifice
all
personal
happiness
and
social
life
to
his
political
goal
something
which
be
quite
unacceptable
to
the
pleasure
love
balfour
moreover
milner
be
intelligent
enough
to
see
that
it
be
not
possible
to
continue
a
political
group
organize
in
the
casual
and
familiar
way
in
which
it
have
be
do
by
lord
salisbury
milner
shift
the
emphasis
from
family
connection
to
ideological
agreement
the
former
have
become
less
useful
with
the
rise
of
a
class
society
base
on
economic
conflict
and
with
the
extension
of
democracy
salisbury
be
fundamentally
a
conservative
while
milner
be
not
where
salisbury
sought
to
build
up
a
bloc
of
friend
and
relative
to
exercise
the
game
o
politics
and
to
maintain
the
old
england
that
they
all
love
milner
be
not
really
a
conservative
at
all
milner
have
an
idea
the
idea
he
have
obtain
from
toynbee
and
that
he
found
also
in
rhodes
and
in
all
the
member
o
his
group
this
idea
have
two
part
that
the
extension
and
integration
of
the
empire
and
the
development
of
social
welfare
be
essential
to
the
continued
existence
of
the
british
way
of
life
and
that
this
british
way
of
life
be
an
instrument
which
unfolded
all
the
best
and
high
capability
of
mankind
work
with
this
ideology
derive
from
toynbee
and
balliol
milner
use
the
power
and
the
general
strategic
method
of
the
cecil
bloc
to
build
up
his
own
group
but
realize
that
condition
have
change
he
put
much
great
emphasis
on
propaganda
activity
and
on
ideological
unity
within
the
group
these
be
both
make
necessary
by
the
extension
of
political
democracy
and
the
rise
of
economic
democracy
as
a
practical
political
issue
these
new
development
have
make
it
impossible
to
be
satisfied
with
a
group
held
together
by
no
more
than
family
and
social
connection
and
animate
by
no
more
far
sight
goal
than
the
preservation
of
the
exist
social
structure
the
cecil
bloc
do
not
resist
this
change
by
milner
of
the
aim
and
tactic
of
their
old
leader
the
time
make
it
clear
to
all
that
method
must
be
change
however
it
be
possible
that
the
split
which
appear
within
the
conservative
party
in
england
after
follow
roughly
the
line
between
the
milner
group
and
the
cecil
bloc
it
should
perhaps
be
point
out
that
the
cecil
bloc
be
a
social
rather
than
a
partisan
group
at
first
at
least
until
or
so
it
contain
member
of
both
political
party
include
the
leader
salisbury
and
gladstone
the
relationship
between
the
two
party
on
the
topmost
level
could
be
symbolize
by
the
tragic
romance
between
salisbury
nephew
and
gladstone
niece
end
in
the
death
of
the
latter
in
after
the
split
in
the
liberal
party
in
it
be
the
member
of
the
cecil
bloc
who
become
unionist
that
be
the
lytteltons
the
wyndhams
the
cavendish
as
a
result
the
cecil
bloc
become
increasingly
a
political
force
gladstone
remain
socially
a
member
of
it
and
so
do
his
protege
john
morley
but
almost
all
the
other
member
of
the
bloc
be
unionist
or
conservative
the
chief
exception
be
the
four
leader
of
the
liberal
party
after
gladstone
who
be
strong
imperialist
rosebery
asquith
edward
grey
and
haldane
these
four
support
the
boer
war
grow
increasingly
antigerman
support
the
world
war
in
and
be
close
to
the
milner
group
politically
intellectually
and
socially
socially
the
cecil
bloc

which
hold
a
position
in
the

of
the

similar
to
that
held
by
the
royal
institute
of
international
affair
in
the

group
the

their
in

lord

professor
sidgwick
in
the
twentieth
century
it
be
dominate
by
those
member
of
the
cecil
bloc
who
become
most
readily
member
of
the
milner
group
among
these
we
might
mention
gilbert
murray
who
perform
a
notable
series
of
experiment
with
his
daughter
mr

of
arthur
balfour
closest
friend
who
be
president
of
the
society
in
the
third
generation
be
quite
different
partly
because
it
be
dominate
by
milner
one
of
the
few
completely
serious
member
of
the
second
generation
this
third
generation
be
serious
if
not
profound
studious
if
not
broadly
educate
and
haunt
consistently
by
the
need
to
act
quickly
to
avoid
impend
disaster
this
fear
of
disaster
they
share
with
rhodes
and
milner
but
they
still
have
the
basic
weakness
of
the
second
generation
except
milner
and
a
few
other
adopt
member
of
that
group
namely
that
they
get
everything
too
easily
political
power
wealth
and
social
position
come
to
this
third
generation
as
a
gift
from
the
second
without
the
need
to
struggle
for
what
they
get
or
to
analyze
the
foundation
of
their
belief
as
a
result
while
awake
to
the
impend
disaster
they
be
not
able
to
avoid
it
but
instead
tinker
and
tamper
until
the
whole
system
blew
up
in
their
face
this
third
generation
especially
the
milner
group
which
form
its
core
differ
from
its
two
predecessor
in
its
realization
that
it
form
a
group
the
first
generation
have
regard
itself
as
england
the
second
regard
itself
as
society
but
the
third
realize
it
be
a
secret
group
or
at
least
its
inner
circle
do
from
milner
and
rhodes
they
get
this
idea
of
a
secret
group
of
able
and
determine
men
but
they
never
found
a
name
for
it
content
themselves
with
call
it
the
group
or
the
band
or
even
us
the
secret
society
of
cecil
rhodes
when
milner
go
to
south
africa
in
rhodes
and
he
be
already
old
acquaintance
o
many
year
stand
we
have
already
indicate
that
they
be
contemporary
at
oxford
but
more
than
that
they
be
member
of
a
secret

which
have
be
found
in
moreover
milner
be
if
not
in
at

by
rhodes
chosen
successor
in
the
leadership
of
that
society
the

in
the
first
five
o
his
seven

in

fifth
it
be
supplement
by
the
idea
of
an

institution

alumnus
would
be
bound
together
by
common
ideal
rhodes
ideal
in
the
sixth
and
seventh
will
the
secret

be
not

and
the
scholarship
monopolize
the
estate
but
rhodes
still
have
the
same
ideal
and
still
believe
that
they
could
be
carry
out
best
by
a
secret
society
of
men
devote
to
a
common
cause
the
scholarship
be
merely
a
facade
to
conceal
the
secret
society

more
accurately
they
be
to
be
one
of
the
instrument
by
which
the
member

claim

make
no
reference

because
he
have
abandon
the
idea
the
first
chapter
of
his
recent
book
the
american
rhodes
scholarship
state
and
reiterates
that
between
and
rhodes
underwent
a
great
change
in
his
point
of
view
and
mature
in
his
judgment
to
the
point
that
in
his
sixth
will
he
abandon
forever
his
youthful
idea
of
a
secret
society
this
be
completely
untrue
and
there
be
no
evidence
to
support
such
a
statement
on
the
contrary
all
the
evidence
both
direct
and
circumstantial
indicates
that
rhodes
want
the
secret
society
from
to
his
death
in
by
dr

s
own
admission
rhodes
want
the
society
from
to
a
period
o
sixteen
year
accepted
practice
in
the
use
of
historical
evidence
require
us
to
believe
that
rhodes
persist
in
this
idea
for
the
remain
nine
year
of
his
life
unless
there
exists
evidence
to
the
contrary
there
be
no
such
evidence
on
the
other
hand
there
be
direct
evidence
that
he
do
not
change
his
idea
two
example
of
this
evidence
can
be
mention
here
on
february
three
year
after
his
sixth
will
rhodes
end
a
long
conversation
with
r
b
brett
later
lord
esher
by
say
wish
we
could
get
our
secret
society
n
and
in
april
a
year
after
he
write
his
seventh
and
last
will
rhodes
be
reprimand
stead
for
his
opposition
to
the
boer
war
on
the
ground
that
in
this
case
he
should
have
be
willing
to
accept
the
judgment
of
the
men
on
the
spot
who
have
make
the
war
rhodes
say
to
stead
that
be
the
curse
which
will
be
fatal
to
our
idea
insubordination
do
not
you
think
it
be
very
disobedient
of
you
how
can
our
society
be
work
if
each
one
set
himself
up
as
the
sole
judge
of
what
ought
to
be
do
just
look
at
the
position
here
we
three
be
in
south
africa
all
of
us
your
boy
i
myself
milner
and
garrett
all
of
whom
learn
their
politics
from
you
we
be
on
the
spot
and
we
be
unanimous
in
declare
this
war
to
be
necessary
you
have
never
be
in
south
africa
and
yet
instead
of
defer
to
the
judgment
of
your
own
boy
you
fling
yourself
into
a
violent
opposition
to
the
war
dr
aydelottes
assumption
that
the
scholarship
be
an
alternative
to
the
secret
society
be
quite
untenable
for
all
the
evidence
indicates
that
the
scholarship
be
but
one
of
several
instrument
through
which
the
society
would
work
in
stead
discuss
with
rhodes
how
the
secret
society
would
work
and
write
about
it
after
rhodes
death
as
follow
we
also
discuss
together
various
project
for
propaganda
the
formation
of
library
the
creation
of
lectureship
the
dispatch
of
emissary
on
mission
of
propaganda
throughout
the
empire
and
the
step
to
be
take
to
pave
the
way
for
the
foundation
and
the
acquisition
of
a
newspaper
which
be
to
be
devote
to
the
service
of
the
cause
this
be
an
exact
description
of
the
way
in
which
the
society
that
be
the
milner
group
have
function
moreover
when
rhodes
talk
with
stead
in
january
about
the
scholarship
at
oxford
he
do
not
abandon
the
society
but
continued
to
speak
of
it
as
the
real
power
behind
the
scholarship
it
be
perfectly
clear
that
rhodes
omit
mention
the
secret
society
in
his
last
two
will
because
he
knew
that
by
that
time
he
be
so
famous
that
the
one
way
to
keep
a
society
from
be
secret
would
be
to
mention
it
in
his
will
obviously
if
rhodes
want
the
secret
society
after
he
would
have
make
no
mention
of
it
in
his
will
but
would
have
left
his
money
in
trust
for
a
legitimate
public
purpose
and
arrange
for
the
creation
of
the
secret
society
by
a
private
understand
with
his
trustee
this
be
clearly
what
happen
because
the
secret
society
be
establish
and
milner
use
rhodes
money
to
finance
it
just
as
rhodes
have
intend
the
creation
of
the
secret
society
be
the
essential
core
o
rhodes
plan
at
all
time
stead
even
after
rhodes
death
do
not
doubt
that
the
attempt
would
be
make
to
continue
the
society
in
his
book
on
rhodes
will
he
write
in
one
place
mr
rhodes
be
more
than
the
founder
of
a
dynasty
he
aspire
to
be
the
creator
of
one
of
those
vast
semi
religious
quasi
political
association
which
like
the
society
of
jesus
have
played
so
large
a
part
in
the
history
of
the
world
to
be
more
strictly
accurate
he
wish
to
found
an
order
as
the
instrument
of
the
will
o
the
dynasty
and
while
he
live
he
dream
of
be
both
its
caesar
and
its
loyola
it
be
this
far
reach
world
wide
aspiration
of
the
man
which
render
to
those
who
knew
him
so
absurdly
inane
the
speculation
of
his
critic
as
to
his
real
motif
sixty
page
later
stead
write
the
question
that
now
arises
be
whether
in
the
english
speak
world
there
be
to
be
found
men
of
faith
adequate
to
furnish
forth
material
for
the
society
of
which
mr
rhodes
dream
this
idea
of
a
society
throughout
the
world
work
for
federal
union
fascinate
milner
as
it
have
fascinate
rhodes
we
have
already
mention
the
agreement
which
he
sign
with
george
parkin
in
to
propagandize
for
this
purpose
eight
year
later
in
a
letter
to
parkin
from
south
africa
milner
write
at
length
on
the
subject
of
imperial
union
and
end
good
bye
for
today
keep
up
the
touch
i
wish
we
have
some
like
mind
person
in
new
zealand
and
australia
who
be
personal
friend
more
power
to
your
elbow
moreover
there
be
several
occasion
after
when
milner
refer
to
his
desire
to
see
a
powerful
body
of
men
work
outside
the
exist
political
party
for
imperial
unity
he
refer
to
this
desire
in
his
letter
to
congdon
in
and
refer
to
it
again
in
his
farewell
speech
to
the
kindergarten
in
there
be
also
a
piece
of
negative
evidence
which
seem
to
me
to
be
of
considerable
significance
in
parkin
write
a
book
call
the
rhodes
scholarship
in
which
he
devote
several
page
to
rhodes
s
will
although
he
say
something
about
each
will
and
give
the
date
of
each
will
he
say
nothing
about
the
secret
society
now
this
secret
society
which
be
found
in
five
out
of
the
seven
will
be
so
astonish
that
parkin
failure
to
mention
it
must
be
deliberate
he
would
have
no
reason
to
pas
it
by
in
silence
unless
the
society
have
be
form
if
the
exist
rhodes
trust
be
a
more
mature
alternative
for
the
secret
society
rather
than
a
screen
for
it
there
would
be
no
reason
to
pas
it
by
but
on
the
contrary
an
urgent
need
to
mention
it
as
a
matter
of
great
intrinsic
interest
and
as
an
example
of
how
rhodes
idea
mature
as
a
matter
of
fact
rhodes
idea
do
not
mature
the
one
fact
which
appear
absolutely
clearly
in
every
biography
of
rhodes
be
the
fact
that
from
to
his
idea
neither
developed
nor
mature
parkin
who
clearly
knew
of
the
secret
society
even
i
he
do
not
mention
it
say
in
regard
to
rhodes
last
will
it
be
essential
to
remember
that
this
final
will
be
consistent
with
those
which
have
precede
it
that
it
be
no
late
atonement
for
error
as
some
have
suppose
but
be
the
realization
of
life
long
dream
persistently
pursue
leave
aside
all
hypothesis
the
fact
be
clear
rhodes
want
to
create
a
worldwide
secret
group
devote
to
english
ideal
and
to
the
empire
as
the
embodiment
of
these
ideal
and
such
a
group
be
create
it
be
create
in
the
period
after
by
rhodes
stead
and
above
all
by
milner
the
idea
of
a
secret
international
group
o
propagandist
for
federal
imperialism
be
by
no
mean
new
to
milner
when
he
become
rhodes
trustee
in
since
he
have
be
brought
into
rhodes
secret
society
as
the
sixth
member
in
this
be
do
by
his
old
superior
w
t
stead
stead
as
we
have
indicate
be
the
chief
rhodes
confidant
in
england
and
very
close
to
milner
although
stead
do
not
meet
rhodes
until
rhodes
regard
himself
as
a
disciple
of
stead
much
earlier
and
eagerly
embrace
the
idea
of
imperial
federation
base
on
home
rule
it
be
in
pursuit
of
this
idea
that
rhodes
contribute
to
parnell
in
although
rhodes
accepted
stead
idea
he
do
not
decide
that
stead
be
the
man
he
want
to
be
his
lieutenant
in
the
secret
society
until
stead
be
sent
to
prison
in
for
his
article
on
organize
vice
in
the
pall
mall
gazette
this
courageous
episode
convince
rhodes
to
such
a
degree
that
he
try
to
see
stead
in
prison
but
be
turn
away
after
stead
be
release
rhodes
do
not
find
the
opportunity
to
meet
him
until
april
the
excitement
of
that
day
for
stead
can
best
be
show
by
quote
portion
of
the
letter
which
he
write
to
mr
stead
immediately
after
the
conference
it
say
mr
rhodes
be
my
manl
i
have
just
have
three
hour
talk
with
him
he
be
full
of
a
far
more
gorgeous
idea
in
connection
with
the
paper
than
even
i
have
have
i
cannot
tell
you
his
scheme
because
it
be
too
secret
but
it
involves
million
he
have
no
idea
that
it
would
cost
to
start
a
paper
but
he
offer
me
down
as
a
free
gift
to
buy
a
share
in
the
p
m
gazette
as
a
begin
next
year
he
would
do
more
he
expect
to
own
before
he
dy
or
million
all
of
which
he
will
leave
to
carry
out
the
scheme
of
which
the
paper
be
an
integral
part
he
be
give
to
make
a
railway
to
matabeleland
and
so
have
not
available
just
at
this
moment
the
money
necessary
for
start
the
morning
paper
his
idea
be
federation
expansion
and
consolidation
of
the
empire
he
take
to
me
told
me
some
thing
he
have
told
no
other
man
save
lord
rothschild
and
press
me
to
take
the
not
to
have
any
return
to
give
no
receipt
to
simply
take
it
and
use
it
to
give
me
a
freer
hand
on
the
p
m
g
it
seem
all
like
a
fairy
dream
he
say
he
have
take
his
idea
from
the
p
m
g
that
the
paper
permeate
south
africa
that
he
met
it
everywhere
how
good
god
be
to
me
remember
all
the
above
about
r
be
very
private
the
day
follow
this
sensational
conversation
stead
lose
a
libel
action
to
the
amount
of
damage
rhodes
at
once
sent
a
check
to
cover
it
and
say
you
must
keep
my
confidence
secret
the
idea
be
right
but
until
sure
of
the
line
would
be
ruin
in
too
many
hand
your
subsidiary
press
idea
can
be
discuss
without
risk
but
the
inner
circle
behind
would
never
be
many
perhaps
three
or
four
about
the
same
time
rhodes
reveal
to
stead
his
plan
to
establish
the
british
south
africa
company
and
ask
him
who
in
england
could
best
help
him
get
the
necessary
charter
stead
recommend
albert
grey
the
future
earl
grey
who
have
be
an
intimate
friend
of
stead
since
and
have
be
a
member
of
the
milner
toynbee
group
in
as
a
result
grey
become
one
of
the
original
director
of
the
british
south
africa
company
and
take
the
first
step
which
eventually
brought
him
into
the
select
circle
of
rhodes
secret
society
this
society
take
another
step
forward
during
rhodes
visit
to
england
in
february
the
evidence
for
this
be
to
be
found
in
the
journal
of
lord
esher
at
that
time
r
b
brett
who
have
obviously
be
let
in
on
the
plan
by
stead
under
date
of
february
we
read
in
these
journal
cecil
rhodes
arrive
last
night
from
south
africa
i
be
at
stead
today
when
he
call
i
left
them
together
tonight
i
saw
stead
again
rhodes
have
talk
for
three
hour
of
all
his
great
scheme
rhodes
be
a
splendid
enthusiast
but
he
look
upon
men
as
machine
this
be
not
very
penetrate
m
twelve
day
after
this
on
february
at
lord
rothschild
country
house
brett
write
in
his
journal
come
here
last
night
cecil
rhodes
arthur
balfour
harcourts
albert
grey
alfred
lyttelton
a
long
talk
with
rhodes
today
he
have
vast
idea
imperial
notion
he
seem
disinterested
but
he
be
very
ruse
and
i
suspect
quite
unscrupulous
as
to
the
mean
he
employ
the
secret
society
after
so
much
preliminary
talk
take
form
in
the
same
year
in
which
rhodes
drew
up
his
fourth
will
and
make
stead
as
well
as
lord
rothschild
the
trustee
o
his
fortune
it
be
perfectly
clear
from
the
evidence
that
he
expect
rothschild
to
handle
the
financial
investment
associate
with
the
trust
while
stead
be
to
have
full
charge
of
the
method
by
which
the
fund
be
use
about
the

time
in
february
stead
and
rhodes
have
another
long
discussion
about
the
secret

they
discuss
their
goal
and
agree
that
if
necessary
in
order
to
achieve
anglo
american
unity
britain
should
join
the
united
state
then
they
discuss
the
organiza
tion
of
the
secret
society
and
divide
it
into
two
circle
an
inner
circle
the
society
o
the
elect
and
an
outer
circle
to
include
the
association
of

and
the
review
of
revietvs

rhodes
say
that
he
have
already

this
be

on

continue
their
discussion

so
they
telegraph
at

to

the

as
drawn
up
in
never

into

in
all
its
detail
the
organization
as
drawn
on
paper
reflect
the
romantic
and
melodramatic
idea
of
cecil
rhodes
and
stead
and
doubtless
they
envision
formal
initiation
oath
secret
sign
of
recognition
etc
once
milner
and
brett
be
make
initiate
the
atmosphere
change
to
them
secret
sign
or
oath
be
so
much
claptrap
and
neither
necessary
nor
desirable
for
the
initiate
knew
each
other
intimately
and
have
implicit
trust
in
each
other
without
the
necessity
of
sign
or
oath
thus
the
melodrama
envision
by
rhodes
be
water
down
without
in
any
way
reduce
the
seriousness
with
which
the
initiate
determine
to
use
their
own
personal
influence
and
rhodes
wealth
and
power
to
achieve
the
con
solidation
of
the
british
empire
which
they
share
as
an
ideal
with
rhodes
with
the
elimination
of
sign
oath
and
formal
initiation
the
criterion
for
membership
in
the
society
of
the
elect
become
knowledge
of
the
secret
society
and
readiness
to
cooperate
with
the
other
initiate
toward
their
common
goal
the
distinction
between
the
initiate
and
the
association
of
helper
rest
on
the
fact
that
while
member
of
both
circle
be
willing
to
cooperate
with
one
another
in
order
to
achieve
their
common
goal
the
initiate
knew
of
the
secret
society
while
the
helper
probably
do
not
this
distinction
rapidly
become
o
little
significance
for
the
member
of
the
association
of
helper
would
have
be
very
stupid
i
they
have
not
realize
that
they
be
member
o
a
secret
group
work
in
cooperation
with
other
member
of
the
same
group
moreover
the
circle
of
initiate
become
in
time
of
less
importance
because
as
time
pass
the
member
of
this
select
circle
die
be
alienate
or
become
less
immediately
concerned
with
the
project
as
a
result
the
secret
society
come
to
be
represent
almost
completely
by
the
association
of
helper
that
be
by
the
group
with
which
milner
be
most
directly
concerned
and
within
this
association
of
helper
there
appear
in
time
gradation
of
intimacy
the
more
select
one
participate
in
numerous
area
of
the
society
activity
and
the
more
peripheral
associate
with
few
and
less
vital
area
nevertheless
it
be
clear
that
the
society
of
the
elect
continued
to
exist
and
it
undoubtedly
recruit
additional
member
now
and
then
from
the
association
of
helper
it
be
a
very
difficult
task
to
decide
who
be
and
who
be
not
a
member
of
the
society
as
a
whole
and
it
be
even
more
difficult
to
decide
if
a
particular
member
be
an
initiate
or
a
helper
accordingly
the
last
distinction
will
not
usually
be
make
in
this
study
before
we
abandon
it
completely
however
an
effort
should
be
make
to
name
the
initiate
in
the
earlier
period
at
least
of
the
person
so
far
name
we
can
be
certain
that
six
be
initiate
these
be
rhodes
lord
rothschild
johnston
stead
brett
and
milner
of
these
rothschild
be
largely
indifferent
and
participate
in
the
work
of
the
group
only
casually
of
the
others
johnston
receive
from
to
a
year
from

for
several
year
after

and
the
portuguese
from

about
he
become

from

of

refusal
to
cooperate
with
him
in
an
attack
on

later
by

him

all
three

in
the
last
two
generation
his

could
be
judged
well
by

inform

brought
him
into

when
it
be
organize
the
follow

the
official

held
by

in
the

chief
british
member
of
the
temporary
mixed
commission
on

of

although
some
of
these
post
especially
the
one
on
the
committee
o
imperial
defence
play
an
important
role
in
the
history
o
the
milner
group
none
of
them
give
any
indication
of
the
significant
position
which
esher
held
in
british
political
life
the
same
thing
could
be
say
of
the
position
which
he
refuse
although
they
if
accepted
would
have
make
him
one
of
the
great
name
in
recent
british
history
among
the
position
which
he
refuse
we
might
mention
the
follow
permanent
under
secretary
in
the
colonial
office
governor
of
cape
colony
permanent
under
secretary
in
the

office
secretary
of

for
war
director
of
the
time
viceroy
of
india
and
an
earldom
date
unknown
eshers
reason
for
refuse
these
position
be
twofold
he
want
to
work
behind
the
scene
rather
than
in
the
public
view
and
his
work
in
secret
be
so
important
and
so
influential
that
any
public
post
would
have
meant
a
reduction
in
his
power
when
he
refuse
the
exalt
position
of
viceroy
in
he
write
frankly
that
with
his
opportunity
of
influence
vital
decision
at
the
center
india
for
him
would
be
it
sound
vain
but
it
be
not
parochial
u
this
opportunity
for
influence
decision
at
the
center
come
from
his
relationship
to
the
monarchy
for
at
least
twenty
five
year
from
to
after
esher
be
probably
the
most
important
adviser
on
political
matter
to
queen
victoria
king
edward
vii
and
king
george
v
this
position
arose
originally
from
his
personal
friendship
with
victoria
establish
in
the
period
and
be
solidify
later
when
as
secretary
to
the
office
of
work
and
lieutenant
governor
of
windsor
castle
he
be
in
charge
of
the
physical
property
of
all
the
royal
residence
these
opportunity
be
not
neglect
he
organize
the
diamond
jubilee
o
the
royal
funeral
of
and
the
coronation
of
the
same
year
in
the
latter
case
he
prove
to
be
indispensable
for
in
the
sixty
four
year
without
a
coronation
the
precedent
have
be
forgotten
in
this
way
esher
reach
a
point
where
he
be
the
chief
unofficial
representative
of
the
king
and
the
liaison
between
king
and
minister
as
an
example
of
the
former
role
we
might
mention
that
in
when
a
purchaser
know
only
as
x
acquire
control
of
the
time
esher
visit
lord
northcliffe
on
behalf
of
a
very
high
quarter
to
seek
assurance
that
the
policy
of
the
paper
would
not
be
change
northcliffe
who
be
x
hasten
to
give
the
necessary
assurance
accord
to
the
official
history
of
the
time
northcliffe
and
the
historian
of
the
time
regard
esher
on
this
occasion
as
the
emissary
of
king
edward
but
we
who
know
of
his
relationship
with
the
rhodes
secret
society
be
justified
in
ask
if
he
be
not
equally
the
agent
of
the
milner
group
since
it
be
as
vital
to
the
group
as
to
the
king
that
the
policy
of
the
time
remain
unchanged
as
we
shall
see
in
a
later
chapter
when
northcliffe
do
adopt
a
policy
contrary
to
that
of
the
group
in
the
period
the
group
broke
with
him
personally
and
within
three
year
bought
his
control
interest
in
the
paper
certain
other
person
be
probably
take
into
the
society
of
the
elect
in
the
next
few
year
hawksley
rhodes
lawyer
be
one
he
obviously
knew
about
the
secret
society
since
he
drew
up
the
will
in
which
it
be
mention
this
combine
with
the
fact
that
he
be
an
intimate
confidant
of
rhodes
in
all
the
activity
of
the
society
and
be
make
a
trustee
of
the
last
three
will
make
it
probable
that
he
should
be
regard
as
an
initiate
likewise
it
be
almost
certain
that
milner
brought
in
sir
thomas
brassey
later
lord
brassey
the
wealthy
naval
enthusiast
whose
name
be
preserve
in
brassey
s
naval
annual
brassey
be
treasurer
and
most
active
figure
in
the
imperial
federation
league
during
its
ten
year
existence
in
as
we
have
mention
he
hire
george
parkin
to
go
to
australia
on
behalf
of
the
league
to
make
speech
in
support
of
imperial
federation
we
have
already
indicate
that
milner
in
approach
parkin
in
behalf
of
a
mysterious
and
unnamed
group
of
wealthy
imperialist
and
some
time
later
milner
and
brassey
sign
a
contract
with
parkin
to
pay
him
a
year
for
three
year
to
propagandize
for
imperial
federation
since
this
project
be
first
broach
to
parkin
by
milner
alone
and
since
the
imperial
federation
league
be
by
in
process
of
dissolution
i
think
we
have
the
right
to
assume
that
the
unnamed
group
for
which
milner
be
act
be
the
rhodes
secret
society
if
so
brassey
must
have
be
introduce
to
the
scheme
sometime
between
and
this
last
interpretation
be
substantiate
by
the
numerous
and
confidential
letter
which
pass
between
milner
and
brassey
in
the
year
which
follow
some
of
these
will
be
mention
later
it
be
worth
mention
here
that
brassey
be
appoint
governor
of
victoria
in
and
played
an
important
role
in
the
creation
of
the
commonwealth
of
australia
in
the
propaganda
work
which
parkin
do
in
the
period
in
fulfillment
of
this
agreement
be
part
of
a
movement
that
be
know
at
the
time
as
seeley
lecturer
this
movement
be
probably
all
that
ensue
from
the
fifth
portion
of
the
ideal
arrangement
that
be
from
the
project
college
under
professor
seeley
another
person
who
be
brought
into
the
secret
society
be
edmund
garrett
the
intimate
friend
of
stead
milner
and
rhodes
who
be
later
use
by
milner
as
a
go
between
for
communication
with
the
other
two
garrett
have
be
sent
to
south
africa
originally
by
stead
while
he
be
still
on
the
pall
mall
gazette
in
he
go
there
for
a
second
time
in
as
editor
of
the
cape
time
the
most
influential
english
language
newspaper
in
south
africa
this
position
he
undoubtedly
obtain
from
stead
and
rhodes
sir
frederick
whyte
in
his
biography
of
stead
say
that
rhodes
be
the
chief
proprietor
of
the
paper
sir
edward
cook
however
the
biographer
of
garrett
and
a
man
who
be
very
close
to
the
rhodes
secret
society
say
that
the
owner
of
the
cape
time
be
frederick
york
st
leger
and
dr
rutherfoord
harris
this
be
a
distinction
without
much
difference
since
dr
harris
as
we
shall
see
be
nothing
more
than
an
agent
of
rhodes
in
south
africa
garrett
be
on
most
intimate
personal
relationship
with
rhodes
even
when
the
latter
be
prime
minister
of
cape
colony
garrett
use
to
communicate
with
him
by
toss
pebble
at
his
bedroom
window
in
the
middle
of
the
night
such
a
relationship
naturally
give
garrett
a
prestige
in
south
africa
which
he
could
never
have
obtain
by
his
own
position
or
ability
when
high
commissioner
hercules
robinson
drew
up
a
proclamation
after
the
jameson
raid
he
show
it
to
garrett
before
it
be
issue
and
cut
out
a
paragraph
at
the
latter
insistence
garrett
be
also
on
intimate
term
with
milner
during
his
period
as
high
commissioner
after
in
fact
when
rhodes
spoke
of
political
issue
in
south
africa
he
frequently
spoke
of
i
myself
milner
and
garrett
we
have
already
quote
an
occasion
on
which
he
use
this
expression
to
stead
in
milner
relationship
with
garrett
can
be
gather
from
a
letter
which
he
write
to
garrett
in
after
garrett
have
to
leave
south
africa
to
go
to
a
sanatorium
in
germany
it
be
no
use
protest
against
the
decree
of
fate
nor
do
i
want
to
say
too
much
on
what
rhodes
call
the
personal
but
this
really
be
a
great
blow
to
me
and
i
have
never
quite
get
over
your
breakdown
and
departure
never
quite
felt
the
same
man
since
either
politically
or
privately
dear
friend
i
miss
you
fearfully
always
shall
miss
you
so
do
this
young
country
i
think
we
be
justified
in
assume
that
a
man
as
intimate
as
this
with
rhodes
and
milner
who
be
use
in
such
confidential
and
important
way
by
both
of
them
who
knew
of
the
plan
for
the
johannesburg
revolt
and
the
jameson
raid
before
they
occur
and
who
knew
of
the
rhodes
secret
society
be
an
initiate
that
garrett
knew
of
the
jameson
plot
beforehand
be
record
by
sir
edward
cook
in
his
biography
that
garrett
knew
o
the
secret
society
be
record
by
garrett
himself
in
an
article
which
he
publish
in
the
contemporary
review
after
rhodes
death
in
the
word
in
which
garrett
make
this
last
revelation
be
of
some
significance
he
spoke
of
that
idea
o
a
sort
o
jesuit
like
secret
society
for
the
promotion
of
the
em
pire
which
for
long
he
hug
and
which
minus
perhaps
the
secrecy
and
the
jesuitry
i
know
to
have
have
a
good
deal
of
fascination
for
others
among
our
contemporary
not
reckon
visionary
by
the
world
we
have
say
that
garrett
be
use
by
milner
as
an
intermediary
with
both
rhodes
and
stead
the
need
for
such
an
intermediary
with
rhodes
arose
from
milner
feel
that
it
be
politically
necessary
to
conceal
the
intimacy
of
their
relationship
as
rhodes
told
stead
speak
of
milner
on
april
i
have
see
very
little
of
him
he
say
to
me
the
less
you
and
i
be
see
together
the
well
hence
i
never
invite
him
to
groote
schuur
garrett
be
also
use
by
milner
as
an
intermediary
with
stead
after
the
latter
become
alienate
from
the
initiate
because
of
his
opposition
to
the
boer
war
one
example
of
this
be
of
some
significance
in
milner
make
a
trip
to
england
without
see
stead
on
april
of
that
year
garrett
who
have
see
milner
write
the
follow
letter
to
stead
i
love
the
inner
man
stead
in
spite
of
all
difference
and
should
love
him
if
he
damn
me
and
my
policy
and
act
ten
time
more
so
do
milner
in
the
inner
court
we
agree
when
he
be
over
only
there
be
temporary
limitation
and
avoidance
he
told
me
why
he
thought
on
the
whole
he
would
well
not
see
you
this
time
i
quite
understood
though
i
be
not
sure
whether
you
would
but
i
be
sure
you
would
have
like
the
way
in
which
without
any
prompt
at
all
he
spoke
of
his
personal
feeling
for
you
be
unaffected
by
all
this
someday
let
us
hope
all
this
tyranny
will
be
overpast
and
we
shall
be
able
to
agree
again
you
and
milner
cook
and
i
it
be
possible
that
the
necessity
for
milner
to
overrule
his
personal
feeling
and
the
mention
of
the
inner
courf
may
be
oblique
reference
to
the
secret
society
in
any
case
the
letter
show
the
way
in
which
stead
be
quietly
push
aside
in
that
society
by
its
new
leader
another
prominent
political
figure
who
may
have
be
an
initiate
in
the
period
before
be
lord
rosebery
like
his
father
in
law
lord
rothschild
who
be
an
initiate
rosebery
be
probably
not
a
very
active
member
o
the
society
of
the
elect
although
for
quite
different
reason
lord
rothschild
held
aloof
because
to
him
the
whole
project
be
incomprehensible
and
unbusinesslike
lord
rosebery
held
aloof
because
of
his
own
diffident
personality
and
his
bad
physical
health
however
he
cooperate
with
the
member
of
the
society
and
be
on
such
close
personal
relationship
with
them
that
he
probably
knew
o
the
secret
society
brett
be
one
o
his
most
intimate
associate
and
introduce
him
to
milner
in
as
for
rhodes
rosebery
s
official
biographer
the
marquess
of
crewe
say
that
he
both
like
and
admire
cecil
rhodes
who
be
often
his
guest
he
make
rhodes
a
privy
councillor
and
rhodes
make
him
a
trustee
of
his
will
these
thing
and
the
fact
that
the
initiate
generally
assume
that
rosebery
would
grant
their
request
give
certain
ground
for
believe
that
he
be
a
member
of
their
society
i
he
be
he
played
little
role
in
it
after
two
other
men
both
fabulously
wealthy
south
african
may
be
regard
as
member
of
the
society

probably
initiate
these

period

to

still
continue
although
since
they
have
undoubtedly
be
eclipse
by
those
of

an
associate
o

alfred

bailey
like
rhodes
and
beit
he
be
willing
that
his
money
be
use
by
milner
because
he
sympathize
with
his
aim
as
his
obituary
in
the
time
express
it
in
politics
he
model
himself
deliberately
on
rhodes
as
his
ideal
of
a
good
south
african
and
a
devote
imperialist
he
have
much
the

admiration
o
milner
and
remain
to
the
end
a

this
last
phrase
refers
to
milners
kindergarten

be
described

we

vital
role

at

take
a
close

this
close
interest

make
possible
by
his
membership
in

certain
others
of

associate
cooperate
with
milner
in
his
design
after

regard
as
member
of

similar
to
those

will
occupy
most
of
the
remainder
of
this

the
change
which
milner
make
in
the
rhodes
secret
society
be
not
important
there
be
no
change
in
goal
and
there
be
very
little
change
in
method
in
fact
both
of
these
be
modify
more
by
lord
lothian
and
his
friend
after
milner
death
than
they
be
by
milner
after
rhodes
death
rhodes
and
milner
be
aim
at
the
same
goal
and
have
be
for
twenty
five
year
in
they
differ
slightly
on
how
these
goal
could
be
obtain
a
difference
base
on
different
personality
to
rhodes
it
seem
that
the
end
could
be
won
by
amass
great
wealth
to
milner
it
seem
that
they
could
be
won
by
quiet
propaganda
hard
work
and
personal
relationship
as
he
have
learn
from
toynbee
neither
reject
the
other
s
method
and
each
be
willing
to
use
the
other
and
his
method
to
achieve
their
common
dream
as
the
occasion
arose
with
the
death
of
rhodes
in
milner
obtain
control
of
rhodes
money
and
be
able
to
use
it
to
lubricate
the
working
of
his
propaganda
machine
this
be
exactly
as
rhodes
have
want
and
have
intend
milner
be
rhodes
s
heir
and
both
men
knew
it
rhodes
himself
say
before
his
death
they
tell
me
i
can
only
live
five
year
i
do
not
mean
to
die
i
want
to
live
but
if
i
go
there
be
one
man
sir
alfred
milner
always
trust
milner
you
do
not
know
yet
what
you
have
get
in
him
in
in
conversation
with
stead
rhodes
say
you
will
support
milner
in
any
measure
that
he
may
take
short
of
war
i
make
no
such
limitation
i
support
milner
absolutely
without
reserve
i
he
say
peace
i
say
peace
if
he
say
war
i
say
war
whatever
happens
i
say
ditto
to
milner
the
goal
which
rhodes
and
milner
sought
and
the
method
by
which
they
hop
to
achieve
them
be
so
similar
by
that
the
two
be
almost
indistinguishable
both
sought
to
unite
the
world
and
above
all
the
english
speak
world
in
a
federal
structure
around
britain
both
felt
that
this
goal
could
best
be
achieve
by
a
secret
band
of
men
united
to
one
another
by
devotion
to
the
common
cause
and
by
personal
loyalty
to
one
another
both
felt
that
this
band
should
pursue
its
goal
by
secret
political
and
economic
influence
behind
the
scene
and
by
the
control
of
journalistic
educational
and
propaganda
agency
milner
intention
to
work
for
this
goal
and
to
use
rhodes
money
and
influence
to
do
it
be
clearly
imply
in
all
his
action
both
before
and
after
in
his
correspondence
with
rhodes
some
of
it
unpublished
and
in
letter
to
parkin
in
september
and
to
lord
grey
in
may
it
be
very
likely
that
long
before
rhodes
die
this
plan
be
discuss
in
private
conversation
o
which
no
record
be
kept
for
example
three
of
the
rhodes
trustee
under
the
last
will
grey
milner
and
beit
with
lyttelton
gell
have
dinner
at
beits
house
and
talk
over
important
matter
far
into
the
night
of
november
it
be
quite
clear
that
rhodes
talk
over
with
his
associate
the
way
in
which
his
ideal
would
be
carry
out
after
his
death
he
live
constantly
under
the
fear
of
death
and
regard
his
whole
life
as
a
race
in
which
he
must
achieve
as
much
of
his
purpose
as
possible
before
he
die
the
biographer
o
alfred
beit
be
quite
confident
that
rhodes
discuss
with
beit
a
plan
by
which
rhodes
would
omit
from
his
will
all
mention
of
a
project
close
to
his
heart
the
cape
to
cairo
railway
leave
this
project
to
be
cover
as
it
be
by
beit
s
own
will
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
rhodes
would
have
discuss
a
project
even
closer
to
his
heart
the
worldwide
group
of
anglo
saxon
sympathizer
with
the
trustee
o
his
own
will
and
above
all
with
the
one
most
clearly
devote
to
his
idea
milner
milner
kindergarten
the
appointment
as
high
commissioner
of
south
africa
be
the
turn
point
in
milner
life
it
be
obtain
apparently
through
his
membership
in
rhodes
secret
society
through
the
influence
of
stead
brett
and
rhodes
stead
in
his
book
on
rhodes
will
claim
the
chief
credit
for
the
nomination
while
brett
be
with
milner
at
windsor
when
he
receive
the
appointment
and
return
with
him
to
london
sir
harry
johnston
who
have
already
be
offer
the
appointment
for
himself
by
a
foreign
office
official
felt
that
it
be
rhodes
influence
which
give
it
to
milner
in
his
autobiography
he
write
at
last
the
decision
be
make
sir
alfred
milner
i
suspect
very
much
on
the
personal
pleading
of
cecil
rhodes
who
profess
himself
delighted
with
the
choice
the
non
selection
of
myself
for
a
work
that
would
have
greatly
interested
me
be
a
disappointment
and
i
felt
it
be
due
to
rhodes
enmity
more
than
to
any
other
cause
as
high
commissioner
milner
be
subordinate
to
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
colony
a
post
held
at
that
time
by
joseph
chamberlain
who
be
already
acquaint
with
milner
they
have
fought
home
rule
together
in
the
election
of
and
have
both
be
in
egypt
in
they
already
agree
on
most
o
the
important
issue
of
the
day
combine
like
other
member
of
the
milner
group
advocacy
of
social
welfare
and
imperialism
moreover
both
be
strong
believer
in
union
with
ireland
and
a
new
tariff
policy
base
on
imperial
preference
when
chamberlain
join
lord
salisbury
government
as
secretary
of
state
for
the
colony
he
be
eager
to
accept
the
suggestion
that
milner
be
sent
to
south
africa
as
colonial
secretary
chamberlain
do
a
number
of
thing
that
won
the
complete
support
of
milner
among
these
we
might
mention
the
new
constitution
for
jamaica
the
federation
of
the
malay
state
and
the
creation
of
the
commonwealth
of
australia
when
chamberlain
resign
from
the
colonial
office
in
on
the
issue
of
tariff
reform
the
post
be
offer
by
balfour
to
milner
the
latter

refuse
in
order
to
complete
the
work
he
have
start
in
south
africa
when
he
be
ready
to
retire
from
his
post
he
recommend
that
his
successor
be
either
alfred
lyttelton
or
lord
selborne
the
latter
obtain
the
appointment
and
not
only
carry
milner
work
to
completion
but
do
it
with
milner
picked
personnel
that

a
brilliant
analysis
of

himself
he
write
he
milner
have
receive
chiefly
from
arnold
toynbee
an
inspiration
which
center
all
his
interest
on
the
service
of
the

he
have
the
instinct
of
a
radical
reformer
join
to
a
close
textured
intellect
which
reformer
rarely
posse
he
have
a
vision
of
the
good
life
spread
in
a
wide
commonalty
and
when
his
imagination
apprehend
the
empire
his
field
of
vision
be
marvellously
enlarge
so
at
the
outset
of
his
career
he
dedicate
himself
to
a
cause
put
thing
like
leisure
domestic
happiness
and
money
make
behind
him
in
bacon
s
phrase
he
espouse
the
state
on
the
intellectual
side
he
found
that
which
wholly
satisfied
him
in
the
problem
of
administration
when
he
confront
them
as
goschen
secretary
and
in
egypt
and
at
somerset
house
he
have
a
mind
remarkable
both
for
its
scope
and
its
mastery
over
detail
the
most
powerful
administrative
intelligence
i
think
which
britain
have
produce
in
our
day
if
i
may
compare
him
with
others
he
be
as
infallible
as
cromer
in
detect
the
center
of
gravity
in
a
situation
as
brilliant
as
alfred
beit
in
bring
order
out
of
tangle
finance
and
he
have
curzon
power
of
keep
a
big
organization
steadily
at
work
he
be
no
fanatic
his
intelligence
be
too
supreme
for
that
but
in
the
noble
sense
of
the
word
he
be
an
enthusiast
he
narrow
his
interest
of
set
purpose
and
this
absorption
meant
a
certain
rigidity
he
have
cut
himself
o
from
some
of
the
emollient
of
life
consequently
the
perfect
administrator
be
a
less
perfect
diplomatist
later
buchan
add
i
be
brought
into
close
touch
with
a
great
character
milner
be
the
most
selfless
man
i
have
ever
know
he
thought
of
his
work
and
his
cause
much
of
his
colleague
never
of
himself
he
simply
be
not
interested
in
what
attracts
common
ambition
he
could
not
be
bribed
for
there
be
nothing
on
the
globe
wherewith
to
bribe
him
or
deter
by
personal
criticism
for
he
care
not
at
all
for
fame
and
it
would
have
be
as
easy
to
bully
the
solar
system
since
he
do
not
know
the
meaning
of
fear
the
effect
milner
have
on
buchan
be
share
by
the
other
member
of
the
kindergarten
and
provide
that
spiritual
bond
which
animate
the
milner
group
this
spirit
found
in
toynbee
in
goschen
in
milner
and
later
in
lionel
curtis
be
the
motivate
force
of
the
milner
group
until
after
indeed
much
of
what
buchan
say
here
about
milner
could
be
apply
with
slight
change
to
lionel
curtis
and
curtis
as
we
shall
see
be
the
motivate
force
of
the
milner
group
from
to
after
as
the
influence
of
lord
lothian
lord
astor
and
lord
brand
increase
and
that
of
milner
decline

some
of

it
to
me
he
be
the
fan
et
origo
it
may
sound
extravagant
as
a
statement
but
a
powerful
defense
could
be
make
of
the
claim
that
what
curtis
think
should
be
do
to
the
british
empire
be
what
happens
a
generation
later
i
shall
give
here
only
two
recent
example
of
this
in
curtis
decide
that
the
name
of
his
majesty
dominion
must
be
change
from
british
empire
to
commonwealth
of
nation
this
be
do
officially
in
again
about
curtis
decide
that
india
must
be
give
complete
self
government
as
rapidly
as
condition
permit
this
be
carry
out
in
as
we
shall
see
these
be
not
merely
coincidental
event
for
curtis
work
behind
the
scene
have
be
one
of
the
chief
architect
of
the
present
commonwealth
it
be
not
easy
to
discern
the
place
where
he
have
pass
and
no
adequate
biographical
sketch
can
be
put
on
paper
here
indeed
much
of
the
rest
o
this
volume
will
be
a
contribution
to
the
biography
of
lionel
curtis
burning
with
an
unquenchable
ardor
which
some
might
call
fanatical
he
have
devote
his
life
to
his
dominant
idea
that
the
finer
thing
of
life
liberty
democracy
toleration
etc
could
be
preserve
only
within
an
integrate
world
political
system
and
that
this
political
system
could
be
construct
about
great
britain
but
only
if
britain
adopt
toward
her
dominion
her
colony
and
the
rest
of
the
world
a
policy
of
generosity
o
trust
and
of
develop
freedom
curtis
be
both
a
fanatic
and
an
idealist
but
he
be
not
merely
a
man
in
a
hurry
he
have
a
fairly
clear
picture
of
what
he
want
he
do
not
believe
that
complete
and
immediate
freedom
and
democracy
could
be
give
to
the
various
part
of
the
imperial
system
but
felt
that
they
could
only
be
extend
to
these
part
in
accordance
with
their
ability
to
develop
to
a
level
where
they
be
capable
o
exercise
such
privilege
when
that
level
be
achieve
and
those
privilege
be
extend
he
felt
that
they
would
not
be
use
to
disrupt
the
integrate
world
system
of
which
he
dream
but
to
integrate
it
more
fully
and
in
a
sounder
fashion
a
fashion
base
on
common
outlook
and
common
pattern
of
thought
rather
than
on
the
dangerous
unity
of
political
subjection
censorship
or
any
kind
of
duress
to
curtis
as
to
h
g
well
man
fate
depend
on
a
race
between
education
and
disaster
this
be
similar
to
the
feel
which
animate
rhodes
when
he
establish
the
rhodes
scholarship
although
curtis
have
a
much
broader
and
less
nationalistic
point
of
view
than
rhodes
moreover
curtis
believe
that
people
could
be
educate
for
freedom
and
responsibility
by
give
them
always
a
little
more
freedom
a
little
more
democracy
and
a
little
more
responsibility
than
they
be
quite
ready
to
handle
this
be
a
basically
christian
attitude
the
belief
that
if
men
be
trust
they
will
prove
trustworthy
but
it
be
an
attitude
on
which
curtis
be
prepared
to
risk
the
existence
o
the
british
empire
it
be
not
yet
clear
whether
curtis
be
the
creator
of
the
commonwealth
of
nation
or
merely
the
destroyer
of
the
british
empire
the
answer
will
be
found
in
the
behavior
of
india
in
the
next
few
year
the
milner
group
knew
this
that
be
why
india
since
have
be
the
chief
object
of
their
attention
these
idea
of
curtis
be
clearly
state
in
his
numerous
publish
work
the
follow
quotation
be
take
from
the
problem
of
the
commonwealth
drawn
up
by
the
round
table
group
and
publish
under
curtis
name
in
responsible
government

only
be
realize
for
any
body
of

in
so
far
as
they
be
fit
for
the
exercise
of

the
great
majority
of

not

capable
of

for
them
the
path
to

primarily
a
problem
of

commonwealth
the

reserve
to
the
european

for
the
unanswerable
reason
that
for
the

this
portion

the

cannot
like
despotism
rest
content
with
establish
order
within

between
the

it
must
by
its
nature
prepare
these
community
first
to
maintain
order
within

the

in
the

of
the
people
themselves
the
people
of
india
and
egypt
no
less
than
those

must
be
gradually
school
to
the
management
of
their
national

it
be
not
enough
that

india
may
contain

qualify
not

she

it
can
she
bear
to
lose
her

find
it
in
a

wide
as
the

itself
a

great
and
nobler
than
before
will
she
fail
at
this
second
and
last
crisis
of
her
fate
as
she
fail
at
the
first
like
athens
and
prussia
forsake
freedom
for

think
the
shadow
more
real
than
the
light
and
esteem
the
muckrake
more
than
the
crown
four
year
later
in
curtis
write
the
whole
effect
of
the
war
have
be
to
bring
movement
long
gathering
to
a
sudden
head
companionship
in
arm
have
fan
long
smoulder
resentment
against
the
prescription
that
european
be
destine
to
dominate
the
rest
of
the
world
in
every
part
of
asia
and
africa
it
be
bursting
into
flame
personally
i
regard
this
challenge
to
the
long
unquestioned
claim
of
the
white
man
to
dominate
the
world
as
inevitable
and
wholesome
especially
to
ourselves
unfortunately
for
the
world
curtis
and
the
milner
group
generally
have
one
grave
weakness
that
may
prove
fatal
skilled
as
they
be
in
political
and
personal
relation
endow
with
fortune
education

connection
they
be
all

to

with

girl
when
they
be
child
fisher
be
a
very
valuable
member
of
the

because
he
along

become
the

a
j
secure
access

this
access
be
secure
by
the
friendship
of
these
two
men
with
sir
william
anson
anson
himself
be
a
member
of
the
cecil
bloc
rather
than
the
milner
group
his
personal
relation
with
milner
be
not
very
close
and
indeed
there
be
some
doubt
as
to
his
actual
feel
toward
milner
the
only
comment
about
milner
in
the
publish
portion
of
anson
s
journal
be
a
rather
acid
remark
regard
the
lack
of
eloquence
in
a
milner
speech
in
the
house
of
lord
against
the
parliament
act
of
nor
do
anson
see
eye
to
eye
with
milner
or
indeed
with
most
member
of
the
milner
group
since
he
be
much
too
conservative
he
be
to
be
sure
a
liberal
unionist
as
most
important
member
of
the
group
be
he
be
also
an
imperialist
and
interested
in
social
welfare
but
he
do
not
have
the
high
disregard
for
system
of
economics
that
be
so
characteristic
of
all
member
of
the
group
before
anson
have
an
ingrain
respect
for
the
economic
status
quo
and
the
old
liberal
suspicion
of
the
intervention
by
public
authority
in
the
economic
field
these
tendency
have
be
strengthen
by
year
of
tender
attention
to
the
extensive
land
wealth
possess
by
all
soul
nonetheless
anson
become
one
of
the
chief
architect
of
the
milner
group
and
be
undoubtedly
the
chief
factor
in
the
group
domination
of
all
soul
since
ansons
death
during
his
wardenship
anson
be
the
most
influential
figure
in
all
soul
not
merely
in
its
social
and
intellectual
life
but
also
in
the
management
of
its
fortune
and
the
selection
of
its
member
in
the
ordinary
expectation
of
affair
the
former
task
be
generally
left
in
the
hand
of
the
estate
bursar
and
the
latter
be
share
with
the
other
fellow
anson
however
take
the
dominant
role
in
both
matter
to
such
a
degree
in
fact
that
bishop
henson
himself
a
member
of
all
soul
since
in
his
memoir
of
anson
say
that
the
warden
be
always
able
to
have
his
candidate
emerge
with
the
prize
fellowship
in
seek
to
bestow
fellowship
at
all
soul
on
those
individual
whom
we
now
regard
as
the
chief
member
of
the
milner
group
anson
be
not
conscious
that
he
be
deal
with
a
group
at
all
the
candidate
who
be
offering
themselves
from
new
college
in
the
period
be
of
such
high
ability
that
they
be
able
to
obtain
the
election
on
their
own
merit
the
fact
that
they
come
strongly
recommend
by
fisher
serve
to
clinch
the
matter
they
thus
do
not
enter
all
soul
as
member
of
the
milner
group
at
least
not
in
ansons
lifetime
after
this
be
probably
do
as
in
the
case
of
lionel
curtis
in
basil
williams
in
or
reginald
coupland
in
but
not
before
rather
likely
young
men
who
go
to
new
college
in
the
period
on
either
side
of
the
boer

marked
out
by

anson
elect
to

sent
into

great
task
of
imperial

this
be
always
the
ultimate
goal

of
milner
and
of
the
kindergarten
milner
write
in
his
diary
on
january
my
work
have
be
constantly
direct
to
a
great
and
distant
end
the
establishment
in
south
africa
of
a
great
and
civilize
and
progressive
community
one
from
cape
town
to
the
zambesi
independent
in
the
management
o
its
own
affair
but
still
remain
from
its
own
firm
desire
a
member
of
the
great
community
of
free
nation
gather
together
under
the
british
flag
that
have
be
the
object
of
all
my
effort
it
be
my
object
still
in
his
great
farewell
speech
of
march
milner
call
upon
his
hearer
and
especially
the
kindergarten
to
remain
loyal
to
this
ultimate
goal
he
say
what
i
pray
for
hardest
be
that
those
with
whom
i
have
work
in
a
great
struggle
and
who
may
attach
some
weight
to
my
word
should
remain
faithful
faithful
above
all
in
the
period
of
reaction
to
the
great
idea
of
imperial
unity
shall
we
ever
live
to
see
its
fulfillment
whether
we
do
or
not
whether
we
succeed
or
fail
i
shall
always
be
steadfast
in
that
faith
though
i
should
prefer
to
work
quietly
and
in
the
background
in
the
formation
o
opinion
rather
than
in
the
exercise
of
power
when
we
who
call
ourselves
imperialist
talk
of
the
british
empire
we
think
of
a
group
of
state
all
independent
in
their
local
concern
but
all
united
for
the
defense
of
their
own
common
interest
and
the
development
of
a
common
civilization
united
not
in
an
alliance
for
alliance
can
be
make
and
unmade
and
be
never
more
than
nominally
last
but
in
a
permanent
organic
union
of
such
a
union
the
dominion
as
they
exist
today
be
we
fully
admit
only
the
raw
material
our
ideal
be
still
distant
but
we
deny
that
it
be
either
visionary
or
unattainable
the
road
be
long
the
obstacle
be
many
the
goal
may
not
be
reach
in
my
lifetime
perhaps
not
in
that
of
any
man
in
this
room
you
cannot
hasten
the
slow
growth
o
a
great
idea
like
that
by
any
force
process
but
what
you
can
do
be
to
keep
it
steadily
in
view
to
lose
no
opportunity
to
work
for
it
to
resist
like
grim
death
any
policy
which
lead
away
from
it
i
know
that
the
service
of
that
idea
require
the
rarest
combination
of
quality
a
combination
of
ceaseless
effort
with
infinite
patience
but
then
think
on
the
other
hand
of
the
greatness
of
the
reward
the
immense
privilege
of
be
allow
to
contribute
in
any
way
to
the
fulfillment
of
one
of
the
noble
conception
which
have
ever
dawn
on
the
political
imagination
of
mankind
for
the
first
couple
of

the

for

throughout
these
activity
the

receive
powerful
support
from
a
man
who
by
this
time
be
a
member
of
the
milner
group
and
later
gain
international
fame
chiefly
because
of
this
membership

smut
have
study
in
england
at
cambridge
university
and
the
middle
temple
by
he
be
a
lawyer
in
cape
town
his
lack
o
success
in
this
profession
doubtless
have
some
influence
in
turn
him
into
the
devious
opportunist
he
soon
become
but
throughout
his
opportunism
he
clung
to
that
ideal
which
he
share
with
rhodes
and
milner
the
ideal
of
a
united
south
africa
all
his
action
from
this
date
onward
no
matter
how
much
they
may
seem
view
superficially
to
lead
in
another
direction
be
direct
toward
the
end
ultimately
achieve
a
united
south
africa
within
the
british
empire
and
to
him
almost
equally
important
a
united
south
africa
in
which
he
would
be
the
dominant
figure
smut
and
milner
differ
chiefly
on
this
last
point
for
if
milner
be
selfless
this
be
almost
the
last
word
which
could
be
apply
to
smut
otherwise
the
two
seem
very
similar
similar
in
their
desire
for
a
united
south
africa
and
later
a
united
british
empire
and
extraordinarily
similar
in
their
cold
austerity
impersonal
intellectualism
and
drive
discipline
apply
to
self
even
more
than
to
others
in
spite
of
their
similar
goal
for
the
empire
smut
and
milner
be
not
close
friend
perhaps
such
similar
personality
could
not
be
expect
to
find
mutual
agreement
but
the
divergence
probably
rest
rather
on
the
one
characteristic
in
their
personality
where
they
most
obviously
differ
smut
and
rhodes
on
the
other
hand
get
on
together
very
well
as
early
as
the
unsuccessful
cape
town
lawyer
be
sent
by
the
great
imperialist
to
kimberley
to
speak
in
his
defense
but
after
the
jameson
raid
smut
become
one
o
the
most
vociferous
critic
of
rhodes
and
the
british
these
attack
give
smut
a
reputation
as
an
anglophobe
which
yield
considerable
profit
immediately
go
to
the
transvaal
where
he
add
to
his
fame
by
uncompromising
support
of
president
kruger

at
the

between

all
of
smut
advice
to
the
former
be
in
the
direction
of
concession
to
milner
yet
it
be
smut
who
draft
the
ultimatum
of
october
which
lead
to
the
outbreak
of
war
during
the
war
he
be
one
o
the
most
famous
of
boer
general
yet
when
negotiation
for
peace
begin
it

he
who
drew
up
the
proposal
to
accept
the
british
term
without
delay
with
the
achievement
of
peace
smut
refuse
milner
invitation
to
serve
in
the
legislative
council
of
the
transvaal
devote
himself
instead
to
violent
and
frequently
unfair
attack
on
milner
and
the
kindergarten
yet
as
soon
as
self
government
be
grant
in
he
become
colonial
secretary
and
minister
of
education
and
work
in
the
closest
cooperation
with
the
kindergarten
to
obtain
milner
ideal
of
a
united
south
africa
there
be
really
nothing
puzzle
or
paradoxical
in
these
action
from
the
begin
smut
want
a
brilliant
career
in
a
united
south
africa
within
a
united
british
empire
within
if
possible
a
united
world
no
stage
would
be
too
big
for
this
young
actor
ambition
and
these
ambition
be
not
except
for
his
own
personal
role
much
different
from
those
of
milner
or
rhodes
but
as
a
very
intelligent
man
smut
knew
that
he
could
play
no
role
whatever
in
the
world
or
in
the
british
empire
unless
he
could
first
play
a
role
in
south
africa
and
that
require
in
a
democratic
regime
which
he
disliked
that
he
appear
pro
boer
rather
than
pro
british
thus
smut
be
pro
boer
on
all
prominent
and
nonessential
matter
but
pro
british
on
all
unobtrusive
and
essential
matter
such
as
language
secession
defense
etc
at
the
national
convention
of
it
be
smut
who
dominate
the
transvaal
delegation
and
succeed
in
push
through
the
project
prepared
by
the
kindergarten
from

and
continued
to
assist
in
this
second
great
battle
o
the

group
as
john
buchan
write
in

be
a
strong

since
the

lord

and
asquith
write
of
milner
after
his

state
his

impressive
that
he

able
young

who
during
his
lifetime

since
have
acknowledge
him

he

up

a

with
a
strain
in
social
and
industrial
matter
of
semi
socialist
sentiment
h
more
convincing
perhaps
than
either
buchan

the
word
of

have
share
continuously
in
this
work
for
a

too
the

still
help
to

the
chance
of

of
their

others
have
beeb
brought
in
to
contribute
new
point
of
view
and
young
blood
the
milner
group
rhodes
and
oxford
it
be
generally
believe
and
state
as
a
fact
by
many
writer
that
milner
hop
for
some
new
political
appointment
after
his
return
from
africa
and
be
deprive
o
this
by
the
election
of
which
swept
the
conservative
from
office
and
brought
in
the
liberal
it
be
perfectly
true
that
milner
be
out
of
political
life
for
ten
year
but
there
be
so
far
as
i
know
no
evidence
that
this
be
contrary
to
his
own
wish
in
his
farewell
speech
of
march
deliver
long
before
the
liberal
victory
at
the
poll
milner
state
in
reference
to
the
great
idea
of
imperial
unity
i
shall
always
be
steadfast
in
that
faith
though
i
should
prefer
to
work
quietly
and
in
the
background
in
the
formation
of
opinion
rather
than
in
the
exercise
of
power
this
be
exactly
what
milner
do
even
after
he
return
to
position
of
power
in
he
work
as
quietly
as
possible
and
attract
public
attention
at
an
absolute
minimum
milner
have
nothing
to
gain
from
public
office
after
until
the
great
crisis
of
make
it
imperative
for
all
able
men
to
take
a
hand
in
active
affair
if
he
want
to
speak
his
own
mind
he
always
have
his
seat
in
the
house
of
lord
and
speak
engagement
elsewhere
be
easy
indeed
too
easy
to
get
in
south
africa
his
union
program
after
be
go
forward
at
a
rate
that
exceed
his
most
optimistic
hope
and
nowhere
else
do
it
seem
in
that
he
could
in
actual
administration
accomplish
more
than
he
could
in
quietly
building
up
a
combination
propaganda
and
patronage
machine
at
home
this
machine
be
construct
about
rhodes
and
his
associate
new
college
and
all
soul
milner
be
not
of
any
political
party
himself
and
regard
party
politics
with
disgust
long
before
as
his
friend
edmund
garrett
write
in
rhodes
and
milner
both
number
themselves
o
that
great
unformed
party
which
be
neither
the
in
nor
the
out
which
touch
here
the
foreign
politics
of
the
one
here
the
home
politics
o
the
other
a
party
to
which
imperialism
and
carlyle
condition
of
the
people
question
be
one
and
the
same
business
of
fitly
rear
housing
distribute
coordinate
and
training
for
war
and
peace
the
people
o
this
commonwealth
a
party
which
seem
to
have
no
name
no
official
leader
no
paper
even
but
which
i
believe
when
it
come
by
a
soul
and
a
voice
will
prove
to
include
a
majority
of
the
british
in
britain
and
a
still
great
majority
of
the
british
overseas
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
these
be
milner
sentiment
he
hop
to
give
that
unformed
party
a
soul
and
a
voice
and
he
intend
to
do
this
apart
from
party
politics
when
he
be
offer
the
position
of
president
of
the
imperial
federalist
organization
he
refuse
it
but
write
to
the
secretary
mr
f
h
congdon
as
follow
personally
i
have
no
political
interest
worth
mention
except
the
maintenance
of
the
imperial
connection
and
i
look
upon
the
future
with
alarm
the
party
system
at
home
and
in
the
colony
seem
to
me
to
work
for
the
severance
of
tie
and
that
contrary
to
the
desire
of
our
people
on
both
side
it
be
a
melancholy
instance
of
the
manner
in
which
bad
political
arrangement
laud
to
the
sky
from
year
end
to
year
end
as
the
best
in
the
world
may
not
only
injure
the
interest
but
actually
frustrate
the
desire
of
the
people
i
can
see
no
remedy
or
protection
under
the
present
circumstance
except
a
powerful
body
of
men
and
it
would
have
to
be
very
powerful
determine
at
all
time
and
under
all
circumstance
to
vote
and
work
regardless
o
every
other
circumstance
against
the
man
or
party
who
played
fast
and
loose
with
the
cause
of
national
unity
you
can
be
sure
that
for
my
own
part
i
shall
always
do
that
milner
in
his
distaste
for
party
politics
and
for
the
parliamentary
system
and
in
his
emphasis
on
administration
for
social
welfare
national
unity
and
imperial
federation
be
an
early
example
of
what
james
burnham
have
call
the
managerial
revolution
that
be
the
growth
of
a
group
of
manager
behind
the
scene
and
beyond
the
control
of
public
opinion
who
seek
efficiently
to
obtain
what
they
regard
as
good
for
the
people
to
a
considerable
extent
this
point
of
view
become
part
of
the
ideology
of
the
milner
group
although
not
of
its
most
articulate
member
like
lionel
curtis
who
continued
to
regard
democracy
as
a
good
in
itself
milner
s
own
antipathy
to
democracy
as
practice
in
the
exist
party
and
parliamentary
system
be
obvious
write
to
his
old
friend
sir
clinton
dawkins
who
have
be
with
milner
a
member
of
the
toynbee
group
in
he
say
in
two
thing
constantly
strike
me
one
be
the
soundness
o
the
british
nation
as
a
whole
contrast
with
the
rottenness
of
party
politics
about
the
same
time
he
write
to
another
old
balliol
associate
george
parkin
i
be
strongly
impressed
by
two
thing
one
that
the
heart
of
the
nation
be
sound
and
secondly
that
our
constitution
and
method
be
anti
quated
and
bad
and
the
real
sound
feel
o
the
nation
do
not
get
a
chance
of
make
itself
effective
two
year
later

down

of

it
be
clear
from
these
list
that
almost
every
important

the

be
a
fellow
of
one
of
the
three
college
balliol
new

or
all

indeed
these

form
a
close
relationship
the
first
two
on
the
undergraduate
level
and
the
last
in
its
own
unique
position
the
three
be
largely
dominate
by
the
milner
group
and
they
in
turn
largely
dominate
the
intellectual
life
of
oxford
in
the
field
of
law
history
and
public
affair
they
come
close
to
dominate
the
university
itself
in
administrative
matter
the
relationship
among
the
three
can
be
demonstrate
by
the
proportion
of
all
soul
fellow
who
come
from
these
two
college
in
relation
to
the
number
which

the

that

be
large
than
these

trinity

be
almost
as

only
thirty

come
from
these
other
five
large
college
while
at
least
fifteen
be
educate
outside
oxford
the
power
of
the
cecil
bloc
and
the
milner
group
in
oxford
in
the
twentieth
century
can
be
see
by
glance
at
the

of

lord

lord

the
influence
of
the
milner
group
at
oxford
be
sufficient
to
enable
it
to
get
control
o
the

after
this

during
the

before
the

have

he
be
a

and
later
a
fellow
of

in
this

he
be
naturally
acquaint
with

a

under

soon
ask

to
join
him
they
jointly
produce
the

its

so
completely
in

valuable
work
this
fact
will
already
have
be
observe
in
the
present
work
the
only
instance
apparently
where
a

there
become

in
that
country
bell
have
be
employ
in
this
capacity
in

since
and
have
become
a
close
friend
of
evelyn
baring
lord
cromer
the
british
agent
in
egypt
he
have
also
become
an
expert
on
egyptian
finance
and
publish
a
pamphlet
on
that
subject
in
miss
shaw
friendship
with
the
bell
family
be
so
close
that
she
be
practically
a
member
of
it
and
belfs
child
knew
her
then
and
later
as
aunt
flora
in
when
bell
be
transfer
to
printing
house
square
as
manager
of
the
time
baring
try
to
persuade
the
time
to
name
miss
shaw
as
egyptian
correspondent
in
belfs
place
this
be
not
do
instead
miss
shaw
return
to
london
and
be
introduce
by
bell
to
buckle
when
buckle
told
miss
shaw
that
he
want
a
head
for
the
colonial
department
of
the
paper
she
suggest
that
he
consult
with
sir
robert
herbert
from
that
point
on
the
account
in
the
history
of
the
time
be
accurate
but
it
be
clear
to
anyone
who
have
the
information
just
mention
that
the
recommendation
by
sir
robert
herbert
the
test
article
on
egyptian
finance
and
probably
the
article
itself
have
be
arrange
previously
between
moberly
bell
and
aunt
flora
none
of
these
early
relationship
of
miss
shaw
with
bell
buckle
and
herbert
be
mention
in
the
history
of
the
time
and
apparently
they
be
not
to
be
found
in
the
record
at
printing
house
square
they
be
however
a
significant
indication
of
the
method
of
the
milner
group
it
be
not
clear
what
be
the
purpose
of
this
elaborate
scheme
miss
moberly
bell
apparently
believe
that
it
be
to
deceive
buckle
it
be
much
more
likely
that
it
be
to
deceive
the
chief
owner
of
the
time
john
walter
iii
and
his
son
arthur
f
walter
miss

when
she
come
to
the
time
be
an
open
champion
of
lord
salisbury
and
an
active
supporter
of
a
vigorous
imperial
policy
especially
in
south
africa
she
be
in
the
confidence
o
the
colonial
office
and
of
rhodes
to
a
degree
that
cannot
be
exaggerated
she
met
rhodes
on
stead
recommendation
in
at
a
time
when
stead
be
one
of
rhodes
closest
confidant
in
miss
shaw
be
sent
to
south
africa
by
moberly

with
instruction
to
set
up
two
line
of
communication
from
that
area
to
herself
one
of
these
be
to
be
know
to
the
time
and
would
handle
routine
matter
the
second
be
to
be
know
only
to
herself
and
be
to
bring
confidential
material
to
her
private
address
the
expense
of
both
o
these
avenue
would
be
paid
for
by
the
time
but
the
expense
of
the
secret
avenue
would
not
appear
on
the
record
at
printing
house
square
from
this
date
onward
miss
shaw
be
in
secret
communication
with
cecil
rhodes
this
communication
be
so
close
that
she
be
inform
by
rhodes
of
the
plot
which
lead
up
to
the
jameson
raid
month
before
the
raid
take
place
she
be
notify
by
rhodes
o
the
approximate
date
on
which
the
raid
would
occur
two
week
before
it
do
occur
she
even
suggest
on
several
occasion
that
the
plan
be
execute
more
rapidly
and
on
one
occasion
suggest
a
specific
date
for
the
event
in
her
news
article
miss
shaw
embrace
the
cause
of
the
british
in
the
transvaal
even
to
the
extent
of
exaggerate
and
falsify
their
hardship
under
boer
rule
it
be
the
time
that
publish
as
an
exclusive
feature
the
famous
and
fraudulent
woman
and
child
letter
date
december
which
pretend
to
be
an
appeal
for
help
from
the
persecute
british
in
the
transvaal
to
dr
jameson
wait
force
but
which
have
really
be
concoct
by
dr
jameson
himself
on
november
and
sent
to
miss
shaw
a
month
later
this
letter
be
publish
by
the
time
as
soon
as
news
of
the
jameson
raid
be
know
as
a
justification
of
the
act
the
time
continued
to
defend
and
justify
the
raid
and
jameson
after
this
become
a
rather
delicate
policy
that
be
after
the
raid
fail
and
have
to
be
disavowed
the
time
be
save
from
the
necessity
of
reverse
itself
by
the
kruger
telegram
sent
by
the
german
kaiser
to
congratulate
the
boer
on
their
successful
suppression
of
the
raider
this
kruger
telegram
be
played
up
by
the
time
with
such
vigor
that
jameson
be
largely
eclipse
and
the
incident
assume
the
dimension
of
an
international
crisis
as
the
official
history
of
the
time
put
it
the
time
be
carry
so
far
by
indignation
against
the
outrageous
interference
of
the
kaiser
in
the
affair
o
the
british
empire
that
it
be
able
to
overlook
the
criminality
of
jamesons
act
a
little
later
the
same
account
say
uon
january
rhodes
resignation
from
the
premiership
be
announce
while
the
editor
found
it
more
convenient
to
devote
his
lead
article
to
the
familiar
topic
of
german
interference
rather
than
to
the
consequence
of
the
raid
all
of
this
be
be
do
on
direct
instruction
from
rhodes
and
with
the
knowledge
and
approval
of
the
management
of
the
time
in
fact
miss
shaw
be
the
intermediary
between
rhodes
the
time
and
the
colonial
office
joseph
chamberlain
until
the
end
of
november
her
instruction
from
rhodes
come
to
her
through
his
agent
in
london
dr

but
when
the
good
dr

and

beit
return
to

in
order
to

secret
code
of
the
british
south
africa
company
and
the
cable
address
tele
mones
london
so
that
communication
from
rhodes
to
miss

could
be
sent
directly
dr
harris
have
already
inform
rhodes
by
a
cable
o
november
if
you
can
telegraph
course
you
wish
time
to
adopt
now
with
regard
to
transvaal
flora
will
act
on
december
miss
shaw
cable
rhodes
can
you
advise
when
will
you
commence
the
plan
we
wish
to
send
at
early
opportunity
seal
instruction
representative
of
the
lonl
time
european
capital
it
be
most
important
use
their
influence
in
your
favor
the
use
of
the
word
we
in
this
message
disposes
once
and
for
all
of
miss
shaw
later
defense
that
all
her
act
be
do
on
her
own
private
responsibility
and
not
in
her
capacity
as
a
department
head
of
the
time
in
answer
to
this
request
rhodes
reply
the
next
day
we
do
think
about
new
year
this
answer
make
the
time
s
manager
very
depressed
so
the
next
day
december
miss
shaw
sent
the
follow
cable
to
rhodes
delay
dangerous
sympathy
now
complete
but
will
depend
very
much
upon
action
before
european
power
give
time
enter
a
protest
which
as
european
situation
consider
serious
might
paralyse
government
five
day
after
this
come
another
cable
which
say
in
part
chamberlain
sound
in
case
of
interference
european
power
but
have
special
reason
to
believe
wish
you
must
do
it
immediately
to
these
very
incriminate
message
might
be
add
two
of
several
wire
from
rhodes
to
miss
shaw
one
o
december
after
rhodes
knew
that
the
jameson
raid
have
begin
and
after
miss
shaw
have
be
so
inform
by
secret
code
state
inform
chamberlain
that
i
shall
get
through
all
right
if
he
support
me
but
he
must
not
send
cable
like
he
sent
high
commissioner
in
south
africa
today
the
crux
be
i
will
win
and
south
africa
will
belong
to
england
and
the
follow
day
when
the
outcome
o
the
raid
be
doubtful
because
of
the
failure
of
the
english
in
the
transvaal
to
rise
against
the
boer
a
failure
result
from
the
fact
that
they
be
not
as
ill
treat
as
miss
shaw
through
the
time
have
be
tell
the
world
for
month
rhodes
cable
unless
you
can
make
chamberlain
instruct
the
high
commissioner
to
proceed
at
once
to
johannesburg
the
whole
position
be
lose
high
commissioner
would
receive
splendid
reception
and
still
turn
position
to
england
advantage
but
must
be
instruct
by
cable
immediately
the
instruction
must
be
specific
as
he
be
weak
and
will
take
no
responsibility
when
we
realize
that
the
anticipate
uprise
of
the
english
in
the
transvaal
have
be
finance
and
arm
with
munition
from
the
fund
of
the
british
south
africa
company
it
be
clear
that
we
must
wait
until
hitler
coup
in
austria
in
march
to
find
a
parallel
to
rhodes
and
jameson
attempt
coup
in
south
africa
forty
two
year
earlier
the
jameson
raid
if
the
full
story
could
ever
be
told
would
give
the
fine
possible
example
of
the
machination
of
rhodes
secret
society
another
example
almost
as
good
would
be
the
completely
untold
story
of
how
the
society
cover
up
these
activity
in
the
face
of
the
investigation
of
the
parliamentary
select
committee
the
danger
from
this
investigation
be
so
great
that
even
lord
rothschild
be
press
into
service
as
a
messenger
it
be
obvious
from
the
begin
that
the
star
witness
before
the
committee
would
be
cecil
rhodes
and
that
the
chief
danger
would
be
the
incrimination
of
joseph
chamberlain
who
clearly
knew
of
the
plot
milner
garrett
stead
and
esher
discuss
possible
defense
and
reach
no
conclusion
since
stead
want
to
admit
that
chamberlain
be
implicate
in
plan
for
a
raid
but
not
plan
for
the
raid
by
this
stead
meant
that
chamberlain
and
rhodes
have
see
the
possibility
of
an
uprise
in
the
transvaal
and
solely
as
a
precautionary
measure
have
make
the
preparation
for
jameson
force
so
that
it
would
be
available
to
go
to
johannesburg
to
restore
order
the
others
refuse
to
accept
this
strategy
and
insist
on
the
advantage
of
a
general
and
blanket
denial
this
difference
of
opinion
probably
arose
from
the
fact
that
stead
do
not
know
that
the
prospective
rebel
in
johannesburg
be
arm
and
finance
by
rhodes
be
lead
by
rhodes
brother
and
abe
bailey
and
have
write
the
woman
and
child
message
in
collaboration
with
jameson
week
before
these
fact
if
reveal
to
the
committee
would
make
it
impossible
to
distinguish
between
the
raid
and
a
raid
the
event
of
december
which
the
committee
be
investigate
be
the
former
and
not
the
latter
merely
because
the
plotter
in
johannesburg
fail
to
revolt
on
schedule
this
be
clear
from
edward
cook
statement
in
his
biography
of
garrett
that
garrett
expect
to
receive
news
o
a
revolution
in
johannesburg
at
any
moment
on
december
the
difficulty
which
the
initiate
in
london
have
in
prepare
a
defense
for
the
select
committee
be
complicate
by
the
fact
that
they
be
not
able
to
reach
rhodes
who
be
en
route
from
south
africa
with
garrett
as
soon
as
the
boat
docked
brett
lord
esher
sent
l
nat
ty
rothschild
from
london
with
a
message
from
chamberlain
to
rhodes
when
rothschild
return
brett
call
in
stead
and
they
discuss
the
project
defense
stead
have
already
see
rhodes
and
give
his
advice
the
follow
day
february
brett
saw
rhodes
and
found
that
he
be
prepared
to
confess
everything
brett
try
to
dissuade
him
as
he
write
in
his
journal
i
point
out
to
him
that
there
be
one
consideration
which
appear
to
have
escape
him
that
be
the
position
of
mr
chamberlain
the
secretary
of
state
chamberlain
be
obviously
anxious
to
help
and
it
would
not
do
to
embarrass
him
or
to
tie
his
hand
it
appear
to
me
to
be
prudent
to
endeavour
to
ascertain
how
chamberlain
would
receive
a
confidence
of
this
kind
i
say
i
would
try
to
find
out
on
leave
me
he
say
wish
we
could
get
our
secret
society
brett
go
to
chamberlain
who
refuse
to
receive
rhodes
s
confession
l
he
have
to
order
the
law
officer
to
take
proceeding
against
rhodes
as
against
jameson
accordingly
the
view
of
the
majority
a
general
denial
be
adopt
and
prove
successful
thanks
to
the
leniency
of
the
member
of
the
select
committee
brett
recognize

why
do
rhodes
try

after
all
we
have
told

it
be
clear
that
the
select

make
no
real
effort
to
uncover
the
real
relationship
between
the
conspirator
the
time
and
the
salisbury
government
when

to
answer

the

whole

exclude
from
examination
by
the
committee
one
of
these
field
and
probably
the
most
important
one
be
the
internal
policy
and
administration
of
the

itself
as
a
result
when
campbell

question
about
the

draft
by

the

take
the
risk
of
allow

to
commit
the

to
the
support
of

in
a
conspiracy

only
salvation
lay
in

take
personal
responsibility
for
the
telegram

in
her
ability
to
convince
the

accordingly

as
the
evidence
of
the
same
source
show
in
order
to
convince
the
committee
it
be
necessary
for
miss

to
commit
perjury
even
though
the
representative
of
both
party
on
the
committee

still
provide
the
public
with
a
good
show
before
leave
the
discussion
of
miss
shaw
and
the
jameson
raid
it
might
be
fitting

unreliable

be
expect
that

chirols
successor
in
the
post
but
amery
enter
upon
a
political

so
the
position
be
give
briefly
to
dudley
disraeli

braham
a
former

of
many
of

thus
combine
the
two
he
resign
from
the
time
in
to
become
editor
of
the
daily
telegraph
in
sydney
australia
and
be
subsequently
a
very
important
figure
in
australian
newspaper
life
this
account
by
no
mean
complete
show
clearly
that
the
milner
group
control
the
time
indirectly
from
if
not
earlier
and
directly
from
the
importance
of
this
control
should
be
obvious
the
time
although
of
a
very
limited
circulation
only
about
at
the
begin
o
the
century
at
the
outbreak
of
the
first
world
war
and
in
be
the
most
influential
paper
in
england
the
reason
for
this
influence
be
not
generally
recognize
although
the
existence
of
the
condition
itself
be
widely
know
the
influence
depend
upon
the
close
relationship
between
the
paper
and
the
foreign
office
this
relationship
as
we
be
try
to
show
be
the
result
of
the
milner
group
influence
in
both
this
influence
be
not
exercise
by
act
directly
on
public
opinion
since
the
milner
group
never
intend
to
influence
event
by
act
through
any
instrument
of
mass
propaganda
but
rather
hop
to
work
on
the
opinion
of
the
small
group
of
important
people
who
in
turn
could
influence
wider
and
wider
circle
of
person
this
be
the
basis
on
which
the
milner
group
itself
be
construct
it
be
the
theory
behind
the
rhodes
scholarship
it
be
the
theory
behind
the
round
table
and
the
royal
institute
of
international
affair
it
be
the
theory
behind
the
effort
to
control
all
soul
new
college
and
balliol
and
through
these
three
to
control
oxford
university
and
it
be
the
theory
behind
the
time
no
effort
be
make
to
win
a
large
circulation
for
the
time
for
in
order
to
obtain
such
a
circulation
it
would
have
be
necessary
to
make
change
in
the
tone
of
the
paper
that
would
have
reduce
its
influence
with
the
elite
to
which
it
have
be
so
long
direct
the
theory
of
the
elite
be
accepted
by
the
milner
group
and
by
the
time
as
it
be
by
rhodes
the
historian
of
the
time
recognizes
this
and
after
describe
the
departure
from
printing
house
square
of
bell
chirol
and
buckle
say
it
be
a
valid
criticism
of
the
old
gang
that
they
have
not
realize
that
they
be
in
the
habit
of
value
news
accord
to
the
demand
and
interest
of
a
govern
class
too
narrowly
define
for
the
twentieth
century
it
be
on
this
issue
that
the
old
gang
dispute
with
northcliffe
in
the
period
and
that
dawson
dispute
with
northcliffe
in
although
the
new
owner
protest
to
all
who
would
listen
in
and
later
that
he
would
not
try
to
make
the
time
into
a
popular
paper
he
be
as
the
history
of
the
time
show
incapable
of
judging
the
merit
of
a
newspaper
by
any
other
standard
than
the
size
of
its
circulation
after
he
be
replace
as
chief
proprietor
by
astor
and
dawson
reoccupied
the
editor
chair
the
old
point
of
view
be
reestablish
the
time
be
to
be
a
paper
for
the
people
who
be
influential
and
not
for
the
mass
the
time
be
influential
but
the
degree
of
its
influence
would
never
be
realize
by
anyone
who
examine
only
the
paper
itself
the
great
part
of
its
influence
arose
from
its
position
as
one
of
several
branch
o
a
single
group
the
milner
group
by
the
interaction

on
one
another
under
the
pretense
that
each
branch

an
autonomous
power
the
influence
o
each
branch

through
a
process
of
mutual
reinforcement
the
unanimity
among
the
various
branch
be
believe
by
the
outside

to
be
the
result
o
the
influence
of
a
single
truth
while
really
it

the
result
of
the
existence
of

a

a

through

an

the

o
some

a
curious
coincidence
both
the
informal
discussion
in
america
and
the
unveil
speech
at
oxford
touch
on
the

topical
subject
an
analogous
procedure

could
be
use
for
policy

book
which
the

do
not
approve

an
unfriendly

by
a
suffocate

be
the
best
that
such
an
offering
could
expect
from
the
instrument
of
the
milner
group
this
be
not
easy
to
demonstrate

of
the
policy
of
anonymity

by
writer

enough
case
have
be
found
to
justify
this
statement
when
j
a
farrers

england
under

be
publish
in
and
maintain
that
the

be
responsible
for
bad
anglo

feel
before
the

give
it
to

when
baron

at
the
time
of

publish

critical
fashion
in
several
passage
in
the

itself
both
of
these
review
be
anonymous
there
be
no
effort
here
to
contend
that
the
milner
group
ever
falsify
or
even
conceal
evidence
although
this
charge
could
be
make
against
the
time
rather
it
propagate
its
point
of
view
by
interpretation
and
selection
of
evidence
in
this
fashion
it
direct
policy
in
way
that
be
sometimes
disastrous
the
group
as
a
whole
be
make
up
of
intelligent
men
who
believe
sincerely
and
usually
intensely
in
what
they
advocate
and
who
knew
that
their
writing
be
intend
for
a
small
minority
as
intelligent
as
themselves
in
such
condition
there
could
be
no
value
in
distort
or
conceal
evidence
to
do
so
would
discredit
the
instrument
they
control
by
give
the
fact
as
they
stood
and
as
completely
as
could

do
in
consistency
with
the
interpretation
desire
a
picture
could
be
construe
that
would
remain
convincing
for
a
long
time
this
be
what
be
do
by
the
time
even
today
the
o
icial
historian
of
the
time
be
unable
to
see
that
the
policy
of
that
paper
be
anti
german
from
to
and
as
such
contribute
to
the
worsen
o
anglo
german
relation
and
thus
to
the
first
world
war
this
charge
have
be
make
by
german
and
american
student
some
of
them
of
the
great
diligence
and
integrity
such
as
professor
sidney
b
fay
william
l
langer
oron
j
hale
and
others
the
recent
history
of
the
time
devotes
considerable
space
and
obviously
spent
long
hour
of
research
in
refute
these
charge
and
fails
to
see
that
it
have
not
succeed
with
the
usual
honesty
and
industry
of
the
milner
group
the
historian
give
the
evidence
that
will
convict
him
without
see
that
his
interpretation
will
not
hold
water
he
confesses
that
the
various
correspondent
of
the
time
in
berlin
played
up
all
antienglish
action
and
statement
and
played
down
all
pro
english
one
that
they
quote
obscure
and
locally
discredit
paper
in
order
to
do
this
that
all
the
time
foreign
correspondent
in
berlin
paris
vienna
and
elsewhere
be
anti
german
and
that
these
be
the
one
who
be
kept
on
the
staff
and
promote
to
well
position
that
the
one
member
o
the

who
be
recognize
as
be
fair
to

that
the

distort
information
on

all
of
this
be
admit
and
excuse
as
the
work
of
honest
if
hasty
journalist
and
the
crown
proof
that
the

to
be
the
fact
that
the
german
do
ultimately
get
into
a
war
with
britain
thus
prove
at
one
stroke
that
they
be
a
bad
lot
and
that
the
attitude
of
the
time
staff
toward
them
be
justified
by
the
event
it
do
not
occur
to
the
historian
of
the
time
that
there
exists
another
explanation
of
anglo
german
relation
namely
that
in
there
be
two
germany
the
one
admire
britain
and
the
other
hat
britain
and
that
britain
by
her
cold
blood
and
calculate
assault
on
the
boer
in
and
give
the
second
and
bad
germany
the
opportunity
to
criticize
and
attack
britain
and
give
it
the
argument
with
which
to
justify
a
german
effort
to
build
up
naval
defense
the
time
by
quote
these

representative
of
the

in

in
new
zealand
in
australia
and
in
a
rather
rudimentary
fashion
and
somewhat
later
in
india
the
reason
for
do
this
be
described
by
curtis
himself
in
in
a
letter
to
the
people
of
india
as
follow
we
fear
that
south
africa
might
abstain
from
a
future
war
with
germany
on
the
ground
that
they
have
not
participate
in
the
decision
to
make
war
confront
by
this
dilemma
at
the
very
moment
o
attain
dominion
self
government
we
thought
it
would
be
wise
to
ask
people
in
the
old
and
most
experienced
of
all
dominion
what
they
thought
of
the
matter
so
in
mr
kerr
and
i
go
to
canada
and
persuade
mr
marri
who
be
then
on
leave
to
accompany
us
on
this
trip
the
three
young
men
cover
a
good
portion
of
the
dominion
one
day
during
a
walk
through
the
forest
on
the
pacific
slope
of
the
canadian
rockies
marri
convince
curtis
that
self

government
however
far
distant
be
the
only
intelligble
goal
of
british
policy
in
india
the
existence
of
political
unrest
in
india
far
from
be
a
reason
for
pessimism
be
the
surest
sign
that
the
british
with
all
their
manifest
failing
have
not
shirk
their
primary
duty
o
extend
western
education
to
india
and
so
prepare
indian
to
govern
themselves
i
have
since
look
back
on
this
walk
write
curtis
as
one
of
the
milestone
of
my
own
education
so
far
i
have
thought
of
self
government
as
a
western
institution
which
be
and
would
always
remain
peculiar
to
the
people
of
europe
it
be
from
that
moment
that
i
first
begin
to
think
of
the
government
of
each
by
each
and
of
all
by
all
not
merely
as
a
principle
of
western
life
but
rather
of
all
human
life
as
the
goal
to
which
all
human
society
must
tend
it
be
from
that
moment
that
i
begin
to
think
of
the
british
commonwealth
as
the
great
instrument
ever
devise
for
enable
that
principle
to
be
realize
not
merely
for
the
child
of
europe
but
for
all
race
and
kindred
and
people
and
tongue
and
it
be
for
that
reason
that
i
have
cease
to
speak
of
the
british
empire
and
call
the
book
in
which
i
publish
my
view
the
commonwealth
of
nation
because
of
curtis
position
and
future
influence
this
walk
in
canada
be
important
not
only
in
his
personal
life
but
also
in
the
future
history
of
the
british
empire
it
need
only
to
be
point
out
that
india
receive
complete
self
government
in
and
the
british
commonwealth
change
its
name
officially
to
commonwealth
of
nation
in
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
both
of
these
event
result
in
no
small
degree
from
the
influence
of
lionel
curtis
and
the
milner
group
in
which
he
be
a
major
figure
curtis
and
his
friend
stave
in
canada
for
four
month
then
curtis
return
to
south
africa
for
the
closing
session
of
the
transvaal
legislative
council
of
which
he
be
a
member
he
there
draft
a
memorandum
on
the
whole
question
of
imperial
relation
and
on
the
day
that
the
union
of
south
africa
come
into
existence
he
sail
to
new
zealand
to
set
up
study
group
to
examine
the
question
these
group
become
the
round
table
group
of
new
zealand
the
memorandum
be
print
with
blank
sheet
for
write
comment
opposite
the
text
each
student
be
to
note
his
criticism
on
these
blank
page
then
they
be
to
meet
in
their
study
group
to
discus
these
comment
in
the
hope
o
be
able
to
draw
up
joint
report
or
at
least
majority
and
minority
report
on
their
conclusion
these
report
be
to
be
sent
to
curtis
who
be
to
compile
a
comprehensive
report
on
the
whole
imperial
problem
this
comprehensive
report
would
then
be
submit
to
the
group
in
the
same
fashion
and
the
result

use
as

this
be
an

the

with
the
date
november
it
have
no

in
the

either

the

of
the

of
the
five
article
the
opening
statement
of

address
to
which

maintain
ever

defend
by
the

itself
in
advertisement
on
the
ground
that
anonymity
give
the
contributor
great
independence
and
freedom
the
real
reason
however
be
much
more
practical
than
this
and
include
the
fact
that
the
writer
be
virtually
unknown
and
be
so
few
in
number
at
first
at
least
as
to
make
the
project
appear
ridiculous
have
the
article
be
sign
for
example
philip
kerr
during
his
editorship
always
write
the
lead
article
in
every
issue
in
later
year
the
anonymity
be
necessary
because
of
the
political
prominence
o
some
of
the
contributor
in
general
the
policy
o
the
journal
have
be
such
that
it
have
continued
to
conceal
the
identity
o
its
writer
until
their
death
even
then
they
have
never
be
connect
with
any
specific
article
except
in
the
case
of
one
article
the
first
one
in
the
first
issue
by
lord
lothian
this
article
be
reprint
in
the
round
table
after
the
author
death
in
the
round
table
be
essentially
the
propaganda
vehicle
of
a
handful
of
people
and
could
not
have
carry
sign
article
either
origi
nally
when
they
be
too
few
or
later
when
they
be
too
famous
it
be
never
intend
to
be
either
a
popular
magazine
or
self
support
but
rather
be
aim
at
influence
those
in
a
position
to
influence
public
opinion
as
curtis
write
in
a
large
quarterly
like
the
round
table
be
not
intend
so
much
for
the
average
reader
as
for
those
who
write
for
the
average
reader
it
be
meant
to
be
a
storehouse
of
information
of
all
kind
upon
which
publicist
can
draw
its
article
must
be
take
on
their
merit
and
as
represent
nothing
beyond
the
mind
and
information
of
the
individual
writer
of
each
it
be
perhaps
worth
mention
that
the
first
article
o
the
first
issue
call
anglo
german
rivalry
be
very
anti
german
and
form
an
interest
bit
of
evidence
when
take
in
connection
with
curtis
statement
that
the
problem
of
the
empire
be
raise
in
by
the
problem
of
what
role
south
africa
would
play
in
a
future
war
with
germany
the
group
in
the
period
before
be
clearly
antigerman
this
must
be
emphasize
because
of
the
mistaken
idea
which
circulate
after
that
the
cliveden
group
especially
men
like
lord
lothian
be
pro
german
they
be
neither
anti
german
in
nor
pro
german
in
but
pro
empire
all
the
time
change
there
their
attitude
on
other
problem
as
these
problem
affected
the
empire
and
it
should
be
realize
that
their
love
for
the
empire
be
not
mere
jingoism
or
flag
wave
thing
at
which
kerr
mocked
within
the
group
but
be
base
on
the
sincere
belief
that
freedom
civilization
and
human
decency
could
best
be
advanced
through
the
instrumentality
of
the
british
empire
in
view
of
the
specific
and
practical
purpose
of
the
round
table
to
federate
the
empire
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
dominion
would
join
with
the
united
kingdom
in
a
future
war
with
germany
the
paper
could
not
help
be
a
propagandist
organ
propagandist
on
a
high
level
it
be
true
but
nonetheless
a
journal
of
opinion
rather
than
a
journal
o
information
every
general
article
in
the
paper
exclude
the
report
from
representative
in
the
dominion
be
really
an
editorial
an
unsigned
editorial
speak
for
the
group
as
a
whole
by
the
s
these
article
be
declare
in
true
editorial
style
that
the
round
table
do
not
approve
of
something
or
other
or
it
seem
to
the
round
table
that
something
else
later
the
member
of
the
group
deny
that
the
group
be
concerned
with
the
propagation
of
any
single
point
of
view
instead
they
insist
that
the
purpose
of
the
group
be
to
bring
together
person
of
various
point
of
view
for
purpose
of
self
education
this
be
not
quite
accurate
the
group
do
not
contain
person
of
various
point
of
view
but
rather
person
of
unusual
unaminity
of
opinion
especially
in
regard
to
goal
there
be
a
somewhat
great
divergence
in
regard
to
method
and
the
circulate
of
memoranda
within
the
group
to
evoke
various
comment
be
for
the
purpose
of
reach
some
agreement
on
method
only
the
goal
be
already
give
in
this
meeting
of
the
group
be
rather
like
the
meeting
of
the
british
cabinet
although
any
normal
cabinet
would
contain
a
great
variety
of
opinion
than
do
the
usual
meeting
o
the
group
in
general
an
expression
o
opinion
by
any
one
member
of
the
group
sound
like
an
echo
of
any
of
the
others
their
system
of
value
be
identical
the
position
of
the
british
commonwealth
at
the
apex
o
that
system
be
almost
axiomatic
the
important
role
played
by
moral
and
ideological
influence
in
the
commonwealth
and
in
the
value
system
be
accepted
by
all
the
necessity
o
strengthen
the
bond
o
the
commonwealth
in
view
of
the
approach
crisis
of
the
civilization
o
the
west
be
accepted
by
all
so
also
be
the
need
for
closer
union
with
the
united
state
there
be
considerable
divergence
of
opinion
regard
the
practicality
of
imperial
federation
in
the
immediate
future
there
be
some
divergence
of
idea
regard
the
rate
at
which
self
government
should
be
extend
to
the
various
part
of
the
empire
especially
india
there
be
a
slight
difference
of
emphasis
on
the
importance
of
relation
between
the
commonwealth
and
the
united
state
but
none
of
these
difference
o
opinion
be
fundamental
or
important
the
most
basic
divergence
within
the
group
during
the
first
twenty
year
or
so
be
to
be
found
in
the
field
of
economic
idea
a
field
in
which
the
group
as
a
whole
be
extremely
weak
and
also
extremely
conservative
this
divergence
exist
however
solely
because
of
the
extremely
unorthodox
character
of
lord
milner
idea
milner
idea
as
express
for
example
in
his
book
question
of
the
hour
publish
in
would
have
be
progressive
even
unorthodox
in
they
be
naturally
ahead
of
the
time
in
and
they
be
certainly
far
ahead
of
the
idea
of
the
group
as
a
whole
for
its
economic
idea
would
have
be
old
fashion
in
these
idea
of
the
group
until
at
least
be
those
of
late
nineteenth
century
international
banking
and
financial
capitalism
the
key
to
all
economics
and
prosperity
be
consider
to
rest
in
banking
and
finance
with
sound
money
a
balance
budget
and
the
international
gold
standard
it
be
expect
that
prosperity
and
rise
standard
of
living
would
follow
automatically
these
idea
be
propagate
through
the
round
table
in
the
period
after
in
a
series
of
article
write
by
brand
and
subsequently
republish
under
his
name
with
the
title
war
and
national
finance
they
be
directly
antithetical
to
the
idea
of
milner
as
reveal
in
his
book
publish
two
year
later
milner
insist
that
financial
question
must
be
subordinate
to
economic
question
and
economic
question
to
political
question
as
a
result
if
a
deflationary
policy
initiate
for
financial
reason
have
deleterious
economic
or
political
effect
it
must
be
abandon
milner
regard
the
financial
policy
advocate
by
brand
in
and
follow
by
the
british
government
for
the
next
twelve
year
as
a
disaster
since
it
lead
to
unemployment
depression
and
ruination
of
the
export
trade
instead
milner
want
to
isolate
the
british
economy
from
the
world
economy
by
tariff
and
other
barrier
and
encourage
the
economic
development
of
the
united
kingdom
by
a
system
o
government
spending
selfregulated
capital
and
labor
social
welfare
etc
this
program
which
be
base
on
monopoly
capitalism
or
even
national
socialism
rather
than
financial
capitalism
as
brand
be
be
embrace
by
most
of
the
milner
group
after
september
when
the
end
of
the
gold
standard
in
britain
prove
once
and
for
all
that
brand
financial
program
of
be
a
complete
disaster
and
quite
unworkable
as
a
result
in
the
year
after
the
businessmen
of
the
milner
group
embark
on
a
policy
of
government
encouragement
of
self
regulate
monopoly
capitalism
this
be
relatively
easy
for
many
member
of
the
group
because
of
the
distrust
of
economic
individualism
which
they
have
inherit
from
toynbee
and
milner
in
april
when
p
horsfall
manager
of
lazard
brother
bank
a
colleague
of
brand
ask
john
dove
to
write
a
defense
of
individualism
in
the
round
table
dove
suggest
that
he
write
it
himself
but
in
reporting
the
incident
to
brand
he
clearly
indicate
that
the
group
regard
individualism
as
obsolete
this
difference
of
opinion
between
milner
and
brand
on
economic
question
be
not
of
great
importance
the
important
matter
be
that
brand
opinion
prevail
within
the
group
from
to
while
milnefs
have
grown
in
importance
from
to
the
present
the
importance
of
this
can
be
see
in
the
fact
that
the
financial
and
economic
policy
follow
by
the
british
government
from
to
run
exactly
parallel
to
the

apparently
in

decade
the
inner
circle
of
the

be
busy
with
two
other
important
activity
in

both
of
these
be
in
charge
of
lionel
curtis
and
continued
with
little
interruption
from
the
war
itself
the
round
table
which
be
in
charge
of
kerr
never
interrupt
its
publication
but
from
onward
it
become
a
secondary
issue
to
win
the
war
and
make
the
peace
the
problem
of
imperial
federation
will
be
discuss
here
and
in
chapter
the
war
and
the
peace
in
chapter
and
the
problem
of
india
in
chapter
during
the
period
as
we
have
say
curtis
be
busy
in
england
with
the
report
from
the
round
table
group
in
the
dominion
in
reply
to
his
print
memorandum
at

o
and

print
these
report
in
two
substantial
volume
without
the

of
the

these
volume
be
never

but
a

report
curtis
draft
a
joint
report
which
be
print
and
circulate
as
each
section
be
complete
it
soon
become
clear
that
there
be
no
real
agreement
within
the
group
and
that
imperial
federation
be
not
popular
in
the
dominion
this
be
a
bitter
pill
to
the
group
especially
to
curtis
but
he
continued
to
work
for
several
year
more
in

there
and
sum
up
the
result
in

follow
a
policy
independent
from

parallel
to
that
of

reduce
the

to
a

and
create
a
new
imperial
government
over
all
the

since
the
last
be
what
curtis
want
he
decide
to

with
the

distribute
among
the

then
a
popular
volume
on
the
subject
with
the
title
the

later
the

again
with
curtis
name
as

thus
appear
for
the
first
time
in
public
the
name
which
the
british
empire
be
to
assume
thirty
two
year
later
in
the
september
issue
of
the
round
table
kerr
publish
a
statement
on
the
relationship
o
the
two
publish
volume
to
the
round
table
group
because
of
the
paper
shortage
in
england
curtis
in
go
to
canada
and
australia
to
arrange
for
the
separate
publication
of
the
problem
of
the
commonwealth
in
those
country
at
the
same
time
he
set
up
new
round
table
group
in
australia
and
new
zealand
then
he
go
to
india
to
begin
serious
work
on
indian
reform
from
this
emerge
the
government
of
india
act
of
as
we
shall
see
later
by
this
time
curtis
and
the
others
have
come
to
realize
that
any
formal
federation
of
the
empire
be
impossible
as
curtis
write
in
in
his
letter
to
the
people
of
india
the
people
of
the
dominion
rightly
aspire
to
control
their
own
foreign
affair
and
yet
retain
their
status
as
british
citizen
on
the
other
hand
they
detest
the
idea
of
pay
tax
to
any
imperial
parliament
even
to
one
upon
which
their
own
representative
sit
the
inquiry
convince
me
that
unless
they
sent
member
and
paid
tax
to
an
imperial
parliament
they
could
not
control
their
foreign
affair
and
also
remain
british
subject
but
i
do
not
think
that
doctrine
be
more
distasteful
to
them
than
the
idea
of
have
anything
to
do
with
the
government
of
india
reluctantly
curtis
and
the
others
postpone
the
idea
of
a
federate
empire
and
fell
back
on
the
idea
o
try
to
hold
the
empire
together
by
the
intangible
bond
of
common
culture
and
common
outlook
this
have
originally
in
rhodes
and
milner
be
a
supplement
to
the
project
of
a
federation
it
now
become
the
chief
issue
and
the
idea
of
federation
fell
into
a
secondary
place
at
the
same
time
the
idea
of
federation
be
swallow
up
in
a
large
scheme
for
organize
the
whole
world
within
a
league
of
nation
this
idea
have
also
be
held
by
rhodes
and
milner
but
in
quite
a
different
form
to
the
old
men
the
world
be
to
be
united
around
the
british
empire
as
a
nucleus
to
curtis
the
empire
be
to
be
absorbed
into
a
world
organization
this
second
idea
be
fundamentally
mystical
curtis
believe
die
and
ye
shall
be
born
again
he
sincerely
felt
that
if
the
british
empire
die
in
the
proper
way
by
spread
liberty
brotherhood
and
justice
it
would
be
born
again
in
a
high
level
of
existence
as
a
world
community
or
as
he
call
it
a
commonwealth
of
nation
it
be
not
yet
clear
whether
the
resurrection
envisage
by
curtis
and
his
associate
will
occur
or
whether
they
merely
assist
at
the
crucifixion
of
the
british
empire
the
conduct
of
the
new
india
in
the
next
few
decade
will
decide
this
question
the
idea
for
federation
of
the
empire
be
not
original
with
the
round
table
group
although
their
writing
would
indicate
that
they
sometimes
thought
so
the
federation
which
they
envisage
have
be
work
out
in
detail
by
person
close
to
the
cecil
bloc
and
be
accepted
by
milner
and
rhodes
as
their
own
chief
goal
in
life
the
original
impetus
for
imperial
federation
arose
within
the
liberal
party
as
a
reaction
against
the
little
england
doctrine
that
be
triumphant
in
england
before
the
original
movement
come
from
men
like
john
stuart
mill
whose
argument
in
support
of
the
empire
be
just
like
curtis
and
earl
grey
who
be
colonial
secretary
under
russell
in
this
movement
result
in
the
found
of
the
royal
colonial
society
now
royal
empire
society
in
and
as
a
kind
o
subsidiary
of
this
the
imperial
federation
league
in
many
unionist
member
of
the
cecil
bloc
such
as
brassey
and
goschen
be
in
these
organization
in
f
p
labilliere
a
move
power
in
both
organization
read
a
paper
before
the
old
one
on
the
permanent
unity
of
the
empire
and
suggest
a
solution
of
the
imperial
problem
by
create
a
superimpose
imperial
legislative
body
and
a
central
executive
over
the
whole
empire
include
the
united
kingdom
seven
year
later
in
the
political
organization
of
the
empire
he
divide
authority
between
this
new
federal
authority
and
the
dominion
by
divide
the
business
of
government
into
imperial
question
local
question
and
question
concern
both
level
he
then
enumerate
the
matter
that
would
be
allot
to
each
division
on
a
basis
very
similar
to
that
later
advocate
by
curtis
another
speaker
george
bourinot
in
dealt
with
the
natural
development
of
canada
in
a
fashion
that
sound
exactly
like
curtis
these
idea
and
project
be
embrace
by
milner
as
his
chief
purpose
in
life
until
like
curtis
he
come
to
realize
their
impracti
cality
milners
idea
can
be
found
in
his
speech
and
letter
especially
in
two
letter
of
to
brassey
and
parkin
brassey
have
start
a
campaign
for
imperial
federation
accompany
by
devolution
that
be
grant
local
issue
to
local
body
even
within
the
united
kingdom
and
the
creation
of
an
imperial
parliament
to
include
representative
of
the
colony
this
imperial
parliament
would
deal
with
imperial
question
while
local
parliament
would
deal
with
local
question
in
pursuit
of
this
project
brassey
publish
a
pamphlet
in
december
call
a
policy
on
which
all
liberal
may
unite
and
sent
to
milner
an
invitation
to
join

milner
accepted
in
february
say
there
be
probably
no
two
men
who
be
more
fully
agree
in
their
general
view
of
imperial
policy
than
we
it
be
clear
to
me
that
we
require
separate
organ
to
deal
with
local
home
business
and
with
imperial
business
the
attempt
to
conduct
both
through
one
so
call
imperial
parliament
be
break
down
grant
that
we
must
have
separate
parliament
for
imperial
and
local
business
i
have
be
come
by
a
different
road
and
for
somewhat
different
reason
to
the
conclusion
which
you
also
be
head
for
viz
that
it
would
be
well
not
to
create
a
new
body
over
the
so
call
imperial
parliament
but
to
create
new
body
or
a
new
body
under
it
for
the
local
business
of
great
britain
and
ireland
leave
it
to
deal
with
the
wider
question
of
foreign
policy
the
defence
of
the
empire
and
the
relation
of
the
several
part
in
that
case
of
course
the
colony
would
have
to
be
represent
in
the
imperial
parliament
which
would
thus
become
really
imperial
one
great
difficulty
no
doubt
be
that
if
this
body
be
to
be
really
effective
as
an
instrument
of
imperial
policy
it
would
require
to
be
reduce
in
number
the
reduction
in
number
of
british
member
might
no
doubt
be
facilitate
by
the
creation
of
local
legislature
the
time
be
ripe
to
make
a
begin
i
wish
rosebery
who
could
carry
through
such
a
policy
if
any
man
could
be
less
pessimistic
the
idea
of
devolve
the
local
business
of
the
imperial
parliament
upon
local
legislative
body
for
scotland
england
wale
and
ireland
be

in
a
book
by
lord

and
in
a
book
call
the
great
opportunity
by
edward
wood
the
future
lord
halifax
these
book
in
their
main
theme
be
nothing
more
than
a
restatement
o
this
aspect
of
the
imperial
federation
project
they
be
accompany
on
june
by
a
motion
introduce
in
the
house
of
common
by
wood
and
carry
by
a
vote
of
to
that
the
time
have
come
for
the
creation
of
subordinate
legislature
within
the

kingdom
nothing
come
of
this
motion
just
as
nothing
come
of
the
federation
plan
milners
idea
on
the
latter
subject
be
restate
in
a
letter
to
parkin
on
september
the
exist
parliament
whether
british
or
colonial
be
too
small
and
so
be
the
statesman
they
produce
except
in
accidental
case
like
chamberlain
for
such
big
issue
until
we
get
a
real
imperial
council
not
merely
a
consultative
but
first
a
constitutional
and
then
an
executive
council
with
control
of
all
our
world
business
we
shall
get
nothing
look
at
the
way
in
which
the
splendid
opportunity
for
federal
defence
which
this
war
afford
have
be
thrown
away
i
believe
it
will
come
about
but
at
present
i
do
not
see
the
man
to
do
it
both
you
and
i
could
help
him
enormously
almost
decisively
indeed
for
i
have
and
doubtless
you
have
an
amount
of
illustration
and
argument
to
bring
to
bear
on
the
subject
drawn
from
practical
experience
which
would
logically
smash
the
opposition
our
difficulty
in
the
old
day
be
that
we
be
advocate
a
grand
but
as
it
seem
an
impractical
idea
i
should
advocate
the
same
thing
today
as
an
urgent
practical
necessity
the
failure
o
imperial
federation
in
the
period
force
parkin
and
milner
to
fall
back
on
ideological
unity
as
achieve
through
the
rhodes
scholarship
just
as
the
same
event
force
curtis
and
others
to
fall
back
on
the
same
goal
as
achieve
through
the
royal
institute
of
international
ah
air
all
party
do
this
with
reluctance
as
dove
write
to
brand
in
this
later
thing
the
riia
be
all
right
it
may
help
us
to
reach
that
unity
of
direction
in
foreign
policy
we
be
look
for
if
it
becomes
a
haunt
of
visitor
from
the
dominion
but
lionefs
first
love
have
still
to
be
won
and
if
as
often
happens
accomplishment
lessens
appetite
and
he
turn
again
to
his
earlier
and
great
work
we
shall
all
be
the
gainer
this
shift
from
institutional
to
ideological
bond
for
unite
the
empire
make
it
necessary
that
we
should
have
a
clear
idea
of
the
outlook
of
the
round
table
and
the
whole
milner
group
this
outlook
be
well
state
in
an
article
in
volume
iii
of
that
journal
from
the
pen
of
an
unidentified
writer
this
article
entitle
the
ethic
of
empire
be
deserve
of
close
attention
it
emphasize
that
the
argument
for
the
empire
and
the
bond
which
bind
it
together
must
be
moral
and
not
base
on
consideration
of
material
advantage
or
even
of
defense
this
emphasis
on
moral
consideration
rather
than
economic
or
strategic
be
typical
of
the
group
as
a
whole
and
be
found
in
milner
and
even
in
rhodes
professional
politician
bureaucrat
utilitarian
and
materialist

be
criticize
for
their
failure
to
appeal
convincingly
as
an
ideal
of
moral
welfare
to
the
ardour
and
imagination
of
a
democratic
people
they
be
also

for
failure
to

that
this

the

how
moral
conviction
and
devotion
to
duty

inspire
the
building
of
the
structure
opponent
of
imperialism
be
wont
to
suggest
that
the
story
will
not
bear
inspection
that
it
be
largely
a
record
of
self
aggrandizement
and
greed
such
a
charge
betrays
ignorance
of
its
history
the
men
who
have
labour
most
enduringly
at
the
fabric
of
empire
be
not
getters
of
wealth
and
plunderer
of
spoil
it
be
due
to
their
strength
of
character
and
moral
purpose
that
british
rule
in
india
and
egypt
have
become
the
embodiment
of
order

an
abstract
term
but
the
fact
it
signifies
be
the
most
concrete
and
real
in
our
experience
the
essential
thing
be
to
grasp
its
meaning
as
a
motive

in
men

this
be
probably
from
kerr
but
could
have

its
strength

measure
not
in

by

prone
to
insist
too
strongly
on
an
ideal
of

for
the

of

depends
not

at

implicitly
all
the

their

interpretation

by

not
at
all
by
the

on
the
contrary
their
economic
ideology
in
the
early
stage
at
least
be
more
socialistic
than
manchester
in
its
orientation
to
be
sure
it
be
an
undemocratic
kind
of
socialism
which
be
willing
to
make
many
sacrifice
to
the
well

this
socialistic
lean

more
evident
in
the
earlier

balliol
period
than
in
the
later

period
and
disappear
almost
completely
when
lothian

replace

seem

me
the

arnold

be
a

critical
of

with

calm
the
question
of
nationalize
the
railroad

even
the
mine
both
toynbee
and
milner
be
early
suspicious
of
the
virtue
of
free
trade
not
however
because
tariff
could
provide
high
profit
for
industrial
concern
but
because
tariff
and
imperial
preference
could
link
the
empire
more
closely
into
economic
unity
in
his
later
year
milner
become
increasingly
radical
a
development
that
do
not
fit
any
too
well
with
the
conservative
financial
outlook
of
brand
or
even
hichens
as
reveal
in
his
book
question
of
the
hour
milner
be
a
combination
of
technocrat
and

socialist

object
vigorously
to
the
orthodox
financial
policy
of

standard
and

advocate
by
the

after
this
orthodox
policy
inspire
by
brand
and
accepted
by
the
round
table
after
be
regard
by
milner
as
an
invitation
to
depression
unemployment
and
the
dissipation
of
britain
material
and
moral
resource
on
this
point
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
milner
be
correct
not
himself
a
train
economist
milner
nevertheless

these

left
them
nostalgic
for
the
fifth

destroyed
by
its
inability
to
organize
any
political
unit
large

the

the

the

history
for
this

especially
for

present
itself
as
an
age
long

between
the

this

of

found
on
the
work
of
zimmcrn
e
a
freeman
lord
bryce
and
a
v
dicey
felt
that
the
distinguish
mark
between
the
two
host
could
be
found
in
their
view
of
law
the
force
of
light
regard
law
as
manmade
and
mutable
but
yet
above
all
men
while
the
force
of
darkness
regard
law
as
divine
and
eternal
yet
subordinate
to
the

the
one
permit
diversity
growth
and
freedom
while
the
other
engender
monotony
stultification
and
slavery
the
struggle
between
the
two
have
go
on
for
thousand
of
year
spawn
such
offspring
as
the

as
the
defender
of
all
that
be
fine
or
civilize
in
the
modern

just
as
athens
have
stood
for
the

in
the
ancient

britain
mission
under
this
interpretation
be
to
carry
freedom
and
light
that
be
the
principle
of
commonwealth
against
the
force
of
theocracy
and
darkness
that
be
autocracy
in
asia
and
even
in
central
europe
for
this
group
regard
the
failure
of
france
or
germany
to
utilize
the
english
idea
of
supremacy
of
law
as
described
by
dicey
in
his
the
law
of
the

as
proof
that
these
country
be
still
immerse
at

partially
in
the
darkness
of
theocratic
law
the
slow

to

as
well
as
asia
in
the
period
before
the
first

be
regard
by
the

as
proof
both
of
their
superiority

of
the
possibility
of
progress
in

and
africa
at

england
civilize
mission
be
to
be
carry
out
by
force
if
necessary
for
the
function
of
force
be
to
give
moral
idea
time
to
take
root
asia
thus
could
be
compel
to
accept
civilization
a
procedure
justifiable
to
the
group
on
the
ground
that
asian
be
obviously
well
off
under
european
rule
than
under
the
rule
of
fellow
asian
and
if
consult
would
clearly
prefer
british
rule
to
that
o
any
other
european
power
to
be
sure
the
blessing
to
be
extend
to
the
less
fortunate
people
of
the
world
do
not
include
democracy
to
milner
to
curtis
and
apparently
to
most
member
of
the
group
democracy
be
not
an
unmixed
good
or
even
a
good
and
far
inferior
to
rule
by
the
best
or
as
curtis
say
by
those
who
have
some
intellectual
capacity
for
judging
the
public
interest
and
what
be
no
less
important
some
moral
capacity
for
treat
it
as
paramount
to
their
own
this
disdain
for
unrestricted
democracy
be
quite
in
accordance
with
the
idea
reveal
by
milner
activity
in
south
africa
and
with
the
greek
ideal
absorbed
at
balliol
or
new
college
however
the
restriction
on
democracy
accepted
by
the
milner
group
be
of
a
temporary
character
base
on
the
lack
of
education
and
background
of
those
who
be
exclude
from
political
participation
it
be
not
a
question
of
blood
or
birth
for
these
men
be
not
racist
this
last
point
be
important
because
of
the
widespread
misconception
that
these
people
be
racially
intolerant
they
never
be
certainly
those
of
the
inner
circle
never
be
on
the
contrary
they
be
ardent
advocate
of
a
policy
o
education
and
uplift
of
all
group
so
that
ultimately
all
group
could
share
in
political
life
and
in
the
rich
benefit
of
the
british
way
of
life
to
be
sure
the
member
of
the
group
do
not
advocate
the
immediate
extension
of
democracy
and
self
government
to
all
people
within
the
empire
but
these
restriction
be
base
not
on
color
of
skin
or
birth
but
upon
cultural
outlook
and
educational
background
even
rhodes
who
be
widely
regard
as
a
racist
because
his
scholarship
be

from
the
nordic
country
be
not
a
racist
he
restrict
his
scholarship
to
these
country
because
he
felt
that
they
have
a
background
sufficiently
homogeneous
to
allow
the
hope
that
educational
interchange
could
link
them
together
to
form
the
core
of
the
worldwide
system
which
he
hop
would
ultimately
come
into
existence
beyond
this
rhodes
insist
that
there
must
be
no
restriction

on
the
scholarship
on
a
basis
of
race

origin
in

nothing
about
these
thing
some
of
his
closest

like
beit
and
in
three
of
his

he
left
lord

as
his

the
other

similarly
lionel

in
his

perfectly
clear
both
his
conviction
that

his

english
success

north

the
comparative

in

to
the

of
institution

again
the
energy

intelligence
which

the

more
than
anything
else
the
root
cause

the

that

similarly
be
clear
from
his
letter
to
brand
without
a
belief
in

it
be
perfectly
possible
for
this
group
to
believe
as
they
do
in
the
ultimate
extension
of
freedom
and
selfgovernment
to
all
part
of
the

to
be
sure
they
believe
that
this
be
a
path
to
be
follow
slowly
but
their
reluctance
be
measure
by
the
inability
of
backward
people
to
understand
the
principle

the
premature

the

such
an

morally
necessary
on
the
part
of

but
be
a
practical

an

to
you
that
the

conclusion

should
be
that
the

rest

sympathetically
handle
without

after

what
this
group
fear
be
that
the
british
empire
would
fail
to
profit
from
the
lesson
they
have
discern
in
the
athenian
empire
or
in
the
american
revolution
zimmern
have
point
out
to
them
the
sharp
contrast
between
the
high
idealism
of
pericles
s
funeral
oration
and
the
crass
tyranny
of
the
athenian
empire
they
fear
that
the
british
empire
might
fall
into
the
same
difficulty
and
destroy
british
idealism
and
british
liberty
by
the
tyranny
necessary
to
hold
on
to
a
reluctant
empire
and
any
effort
to
hold
an
empire
by
tyranny
they
regard
as
doom
to
failure
britain
would
be
destroyed
as
athens
be
destroyed
by
power
more
tyrannical
than
herself
and
still
draw
parallel
with
ancient
greece
the
group
fear
that
all
culture
and
civilization
would
go
down
to
destruction
because
of
our
inability
to
construct
some
kind
of
political
unit
large
than
the
national
state
just
as
greek
culture
and
civilization
in
the
fourth
century
b
c
go
down
to
destruction
because
of
the

inability

of
political
unit
large
than
the
city

this
be
the
fear
that
have
animate
rhodes
and
it
be
the
same
fear
that
be
drive
the
milner
group
to
transform
the
british
empire
into
a
commonwealth
of
nation
and
then
place
that
system
within
a
league
of
nation
in
curtis
write
in
his
letter
to
the
people
of
india
the
world
be
in
throe
which
precede
creation
or
death
our
whole
race
have
outgrown
the
merely
national
state
and
as
surely
as
day
follow
night
or
night
the
day
will
pas
either
to
a
commonwealth
of
nation
or
else
an
empire
o
slave
and
the
issue
of
these
agony
rest
with
us
at
the
same
time
the
example
of
the
american
revolution
show
the
group
the
danger
of
try
to
rule
the
empire
from
london
to
tax
without
representation
could
only
lead
to
disruption
yet
it
be
no
longer
possible
that
million
in
the
united
kingdom
could
tax
themselves
for
the
defense
of
million
in
the
british
empire
what
then
be
the
solution
the
milner
group
effort
to
answer
this
question
lead
eventually
as
we
shall
see
in
chapter
to
the
present
commonwealth
of

but
before

the
illiberal
economic
regulation
o
which
they
have
be
dream
since
chamberlain
resign
in
at
least
the
group
get
to
power
in
by
a
method
which
they
repeat
with
the
labour
party
in
by
a
secret
intrigue
with
a
parvenu
leader
of
the
government
the
group
offer
to
make
him
head
of
a
new
government
if
he
would
split
his
own
party
and
become
prime
minister
support
by
the
group
and
whatever
member
he
could
split
off
from
his
own
party
the
chief
difference
between
and
be
that
in
the
former
year
the
minority
that
be
be
betrayed
be
the
group
own
social
class
in
fact
the
liberal
party
member
of
the
cecil
bloc
another
difference
be
that
in
the
plot
work
the
liberal
party
be
split
and
permanently
destroyed
while
in
the
plotter
broke
only
a
fragment
of
the
labour
party
and
damage
it
only
temporarily
for
fourteen
year
this
last
difference
however
be
not
cause
by
any
lack
of
skill
in
carry
out
the
intrigue
but
by
the
sociological
difference
between
the
liberal
party
and
the
labour
party
in
the
twentieth
century
the
latter
be
rid
the
wave
of
the
future
while
the
former
be
merely
one
of
two
team
put
on
the
field
by
the
same
school
for
an
intramural
game
and
as
such
it
be
bound
to
fuse
with
its
temporary
antagonist
as
soon
as
the
future
produce
an
extramural
challenger
this
strange
to
an
outsider
point
of
view
will
explain
why
asquith
have
no
real
animosity
for
bonar
law
or
balfour
who
really
betrayed
him
but
devote
the
rest
o
his
life
to
belittling
the
action
of
lloyd
george
asquith
talk
later
about
how
he
be
deceive
and
even
lie
to
in
december
but
never
make
any
personal
attack
on
bonar
law
who
do
the
pre
varicating
i
any
the
action
of

acceptable

code
largely
construct

but
lloyd
george
action
which
be
considerably
less
deliberate
and
cold

be
quite
unforgivable
come

this

that
a
very
large
number
of
the

who
write

be
from

anyone
familar
with
the

of

cannot
fail
to
recognize
name
which
we
have
mention
frequently
at
about
this
time
lloyd
george
begin
to
get
out
of
hand
as
far
as
the
milner
group
be
concerned
and
doubtless
also
as
far
as
the
cecil
bloc
be
concerned
some
of
this
be
cause
by
the
weakness
of
balfour
titular
head
of
the
latter
group
but
much
more
be
cause
by
the
fact
that
the
group
could
not
control
lloyd
george
either
in
his
electoral
campaign
in
december
or
in
his
negotiation
in
the
council
of
four
from
march
to
june
lloyd
george
be
perfectly
willing
to
use
the
ability
of
the
milner
group
in
administration
but
when
it
come
to
an
appeal
to
the
electorate
as
in
the
khaki
election
m
he
have
no
respect
for
the
group
s
judgment
or
advice
lloyd
george
realize
that
the
electorate
be
hysterical
with
hatred
of
germany
and
be
willing
to
appeal
to
that
feel
if
he
could
ride
into
office
again
on
its
impetus
the
milner
group
on
the
other
hand
be
eager
to
get
rid
of
the
kaiser
the
prussian
officer
corp
and
even
the
junker
landlord
but
once
germany
be
defeat
their
feel
of
animosity
against
her
which
have
waxed
strong
since
before
vanished
by
they
begin
to
think
in
term
o
balance
of
power
and
of
the
need
to
reconstruct
germany
against
the
danger
o
bolshevism
on
one
hand
and
of
french
militarism
on
the
other
and
they
felt
that
if
germany
be
make
democratic
and
treat
in
a
friendly
fashion
she
could
be
incorporate
into
the
british
world
system
as
well
as
the
cape
boer
have
be
the
intellectual
climate
of
the
milner
group
early
in
have
be
described
by
a
man
who
be
at
this
time
close
to
the
group
harold
nicolson
in
his
volume
peacemaking
this
point
of
view
be
never
thoroughly
thought
out
by
the
group
it
be
apparently
base
on
the
belief
that
if
germany
be
treat
in
a
conciliatory
fashion
she
could
be
won
from
her
aggressive
attitude
and
become
a
civilize
member
of
the
british
world
system
this
may
have
be
possible
but
if
so
the
plan
be
very
badly
execute
because
the
aggressive
element
in
germany
be
not
eliminate
and
the
conciliatory
element
be
not
encourage
in
a
concrete
fashion
this
failure
however
be
partly
cause
by
the
pressure
of
public
opinion
by
the
refusal
of
the
french
to
accept
this
concept
as
an
adequate
goal
of
foreign
policy
and
by
the
failure
to
analyze
the
method
of
the
policy
in
a
sound
and
adequate
fashion
the
first
step
toward
this
policy
be
make
by
milner
himself
as
early
as
october
when
he
issue
a
warn
not
to
denounce
the
whole
german
nation
as
monster
of
iniquity
or
to
carry
out
a
policy
of
punishment
and
reprisal
against
them
the
outburst
of
public
indignation
at
this
sentiment
be
so
great
that
the
whole
band
of
men
who
have
learn
under
him
in
south
africa
to
appreciate
his
patriotism
united
to
testify
to
him
their
affectionate
respect
this
quotation
from
one
of
the
band
basil
williams
refers
to
a
testimonial
give
by
the
group
to
their
leader
in
another
evidence
of
this
feel
will
be
found
in
a
volume
of
alfred
zimmern
publish
in
under
the
title
europe
in
convalescence
and
devote
to
regret
britain
postwar
policy
and
especially
the
election
of
strangely
enough
zimmern
although
most
articulate
in
this
volume
be
basically
more
anti
german
than
the
other
member
of
the
group
and
do
not
share
their
rather
naive
belief
that
the
german
could
be
redeem
merely
by
the
victor
toss
away
the
advantage
of
victory
zimmern
have
a
great
degree
of
sympathy
for
the
french
idea
that
the
german
should
give
more
concrete
example
of
a
reform
spirit
before
they
be
allow
to
run
freely
in
civilize
society
halifax
on
the
other
hand
be
considerably
more
influence
by
popular
feel
in
and
year
later
he
share
the
public
hysteria
against
germany
in
to
a
degree
which
he
later
wish
to
forget
just
as
in
he
share
the
appeasement
policy
toward
germany
to
a
degree
he
would
now
doubtless
want
to
forget
both
of
these
men
however
be
not
of
the
inner
circle
of
the
milner
group
the
sentiment
of
that
inner
circle
men
like
kerr
brand
and
dawson
can
be
found
in
the
speech
of
the
first
the
time
editorial
of
the
last
and
the
article
of
the
round
table
they
can
also
be
see
in
the
letter
o
john
dove
the
latter
write
to
brand
october
state
it
seem
to
me
that
the
most
disastrous
affect
of
poincares
policy
would
be
the
final
collapse
of
democracy
in
germany
the
risk
of
which
have
be
point
out
in
the
round
table
the
irony
of
the
whole
situation
be
that
if
the
junker
should
capture
the
reich
again
the
same
old
antagonism
will
revive
and
we
shall
find
ourselves
willy
nilly
line
up
again
with
france
to
avert
a
danger
which
french
action
have
again
call
into
be
even
if
smut
follow
up
his
fine
speech
the
situation
may
have
change
so
much
before
the
imperial
conference
be
over
that
people
who
think
like
him
and
us
may
find
themselves
baffle
i
doubt
if
we
shall
again
have
as
good
a
chance
of
get
a
peaceful
democracy
set
up
in
germany
the
creation
of
the
commonwealth
the
evolution
o
the
british
empire
into
the
commonwealth
of
nation
be
to
a
very
great
extent
a
result
of
the
activity
of
the
milner
group
to
be
sure
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
group
be
quite
different
from
the
present
system
since
they
want
a
federation
of
the
empire
but
this
be
a
long
run
goal
and
en
route
they
accepted
the
present
system
as
a
temporary
way
station
however
the
strength
of
colonial
and
dominion
feel
which
make
the
ideal
of
federation
admittedly
remote
at
all
time
have
succeed
in
make
this
way
station
a
permanent
terminal
and
thus
have
eliminate
apparently
forever
the
hope
for
federation
with
the
exception
of
a
few
diehard
o
whom
milner
and
curtis
be
the
leader
the
group
have
accepted
the
solution
of
imperial
cooperation
and
parallelism
as
an
alternative
to
federation
this
be
definitely
state
in
the
round
table
o
december
in
that
issue
the
group
adopt
the
path
of
cooperation
as
its
future
policy
and
add
its
the
round
table
promoter
in
this
country
feel
bound
to
state
that
all
the
experience
of
the
war
and
of
the
peace
have
not
shaken
in
the
least
the
fundamental
conviction
with
which
they
commenced
the
publication
of
this
review
the
round
table
have
never
express
an
opinion
as
to
the
form
which
this
constitutional
organization
would
take
nor
as
to
the
time
when
it
should
be
undertaken
but
it
have
never
disguise
its
conviction
that
a
cooperate
system
would
eventually
break
down
in
september
in
a
review
o
its
first
twenty
five
year
the
journal
state
since
the
war
therefore
though
it
have
never
abandon
its
view
that
the
only
final
basis
for
freedom
and
endure
peace
be
the
organic
union
of
nation
in
a
commonwealth
embrace
the
whole
world
or
in
the
first
instance
a
lesser
part
of
it
the
round
table
have
be
a
consistent
supporter
of
the
principle
upon
which
the
british
empire
now
rest
as
set
forth
in
the
balfour
memorandum
of
it
have
felt
that
only
by
try
the
cooperation
method
to
the
utmost
and
realize
its
limitation
in
practice
would
nation
within
or
without
the
british
empire
be
brought
to
face
the
necessity
for
organic
union
there
apparently
exists
within
the
milner
group
a
myth
to
the
effect
that
they
invent
the
expression
commonwealth
of
nation
that
it
be
derive
from
zimmern
book
the
greek
commonwealth
publish
in
and
first
appear
in
public
in
the
title
of
curtis
book
in
this
be
not
quite
accurate
for
the
old
imperialist
of
the
cecil
bloc
have
use
the
term
commonwealth
in
reference
to
the
british
empire
on
various
occasion
as
early
as
in
that
year
in
a
speech
at
adelaide
australia
lord
rosebery
refer
to
the
possibility
of
new
zealand
secede
from
the
empire
and
add
god
forbid
there
be
no
need
for
any
nation
however
great
leave
the
empire
because
the
empire
be
a
commonwealth
of
nation
if
the
milner
group
do
not
invent
the
term
they
give
it
a
very
definite
and
special
meaning
base
on
zimmern
book
and
they
popularize
the
use
o
the
expression
accord
to
zimmern
the
expression
commonwealth
refer
to
a
community
base
on
freedom
and
the
rule
of
law
in
distinction
to
a
government
base
on
authority
or
even
arbitrary
tyranny
the
distinction
be
work
out
in
zimmern
book
in
the
contrast
between
athens
as
described
in
pericles
funeral
oration
and
sparta
or
the
actual
conduct
of
the
athenian
empire
as
apply
to
the
modern
world
the
contrast
be
between
the
british
government
as
described
by
dicey
and
the
despotism
of
philip
ii
wilhelm
ii
and
nicholas
ii
in
this
sense
of
the
word
commonwealth
be
not
originally
an
alternative
to
federation
as
it
later
become
since
it
refer
to
the
moral
quality
of
government
and
these
could
exist
within
either
a
federate
or
a
nonfederated
empire
the
expression
british
commonwealth
of
nation
be
then
not
invent
by
the
group
but
be
give
a
very
special
meaning
and
be
propagate
in
this
sense
until
it
finally
become
common
usage
the
first
step
in
this
direction
be
take
on
may
when
general
smut
at
a
banquet
in
his
honor
in
the
house
of
parliament
use
the
expression
this
banquet
be
apparently
arrange
by
the
milner
group
and
lord
milner
sat
at
smut
right
hand
during
the
speech
the
speech
itself
be
print
and
give
the
wide
publicity
be
disseminate
throughout
great
britain
the
commonwealth
the
united
state
and
the
rest
o
the
world
in
retrospect
some
person
have
believe
that
smut
be
reject
the
meaning
of
the
expression
as
use
by
the
milner
group
because
he
do
reject
the
project
for
imperial
federation
in
this
speech
this
however
be
a
mistake
for
as
we
have
say
the
expression
commonwealth
at
that
time
have
a
meaning
which
could
include
either
federation
or
cooperation
among
the
member
o
the
british
imperial
system
the
antithesis
in
meaning
between
federation
and
commonwealth
be
a
later
development
which
take
place
outside
the
group
to
this
day
men
like
curtis
amery
and
grigg
still
use
the
term
commonwealth
as
apply
to
a
federate
empire
and
they
always
define
the
word
commonwealth
as
a
government
of
liberty
under
the
law
and
not
as
an
arrangement
of
independent
but
cooperate
state
the
development
of
the
british
empire
into
the
commonwealth
of
nation
and
the
role
which
the
milner
group
played
in
this
development
cannot
be
understood
by
anyone
who
feel
that
federation
and
commonwealth
be
mutually
exclusive
idea
in
fact
there
be
not
two
idea
but
three
and
they
be
not
regard
by
the
group
as
substitute
for
each
other
but
as
supplement
to
each
other
these
three
idea
be
the
creation
of
a
common
ideology
and
world
outlook
among
the
people
o
the
united
kingdom
the
empire
and
the
united
state
the
creation
of
instrument
and
practice
of
cooperation
among
these
various
community
in
order
that
they
might
pursue
parallel
policy
and
the
creation
o
a
federation
on
an
imperial
anglo
american
or
world
basis
the
milner
group
regard
these
as
supplementary
to
one
another
and
work
vigorously
for
all
of
them
without
believe
that
they
be
mutually
exclusive
alternative
they
always
realize
even
the
most
fanatical
of
them
that
federation
even
of
the
empire
only
be
very
remote
they
always
in
this
connection
use
such
expression
as
not
in
our
lifetime
or
not
in
the
present
century
they
always
insist
that
the
basic
unity
of
any
system
must
rest
on
common
ideology
and
they
work
in
this
direction
through
the
rhodes
scholarship
the
round
table
group
and
the
institute
of
international
affair
even
when
they
be
most
ardently
seek
to
create
organize
constitutional
relationship
and
in
these
constitutional
relationship
they
work
equally
energetically
and
simultaneously
for
imperial
federation
and
for
such
instrument
of
cooperation
as
conference
of
prime
minister
o
dominion
the
idea
which
seem
to
have
gain
currency
that
the
round
table
group
be
solely
commit
to
federation
and
that
the
failure
o
this
project
marked
the
defeat
and
eclipse
of
the
group
be
erroneous
on
the
contrary
by
the
s
the
round
table
group
be
work
so
strongly
for
a
common
ideology
and
for
institution
of
cooperation
that
many
believer
in
federation
regard
them
as
defeatist
for
this
reason
some
believer
in
federation
organize
a
new
movement
call
the
world
commonwealth
movement
evidence
of
this
movement
be
an
article
by
lord
davy
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
after
for
january
call
round
table
or
world
commonwealth
this
new
movement
be
critical
of
the
foreign
policy
rather
than
the
imperial
policy
of
the
round
table
group
especially
its
policy
of
appeasement
toward
germany
and
of
weaken
the
league
of
nation
and
its
belief
that
britain
could
find
security
in
isolation
from
the
continent
and
a
balance
of
power
policy
support
by
the
united
kingdom
the
dominion
and
the
united
state
the
effort
of
the
round
table
group
to
create
a
common
ideology
to
unite
the
supporter
o
the
british
way
o
life
appear
in
every
aspect
of
their
work
it
be
derive
from
rhodes
and
milner
and
found
its
most
perfect
manifestation
in
the
rhodes
scholarship
as
a
result
of
these
and
of
the
milner
group
control
of
so
much
of
oxford
oxford
tend
to
become
an
international
university
here
the
milner
group
have
to
tread
a
narrow
path
between
the
necessity
of
training
non
english
include
american
and
indian
in
the
english
way
of
life
and
the
possibility
of
submerge
that
way
of
life
completely
at
oxford
at
least
by
admit
too
many
non
english
to
its
cloister
hall
on
the
whole
this
path
be
follow
with
considerable
success
as
will
be
realize
by
anyone
who
have
have
any
experience
with
rhodes
scholar
to
be
sure
the
visitor
from
across
the
sea
picked
up
the
social
custom
of
the
english
somewhat
more
readily
than
they
do
the
english
idea
of
play
the
game
or
the
english
idea
of
politics
but
on
the
whole
the
experiment
of
rhodes
milner
and
lothian
cannot
be
call
a
failure
it
be
surely
a
great
success
in
the
united
state
than
it
be
in
the
dominion
or
in
india
for
in
the
last
at
least
the
english
idea
of
liberty
be
assimilate
much
more
completely
than
the
idea
o
loyalty
to
england
the
effort
of
the
milner
group
to
encourage
federation
of
the
empire
have
already
be
indicate
they
fail
and
indeed
be
bound
to
fail
as
most
member
o
the
group
soon
realize
as
early
as
john
buchan
and
joseph
chamberlain
have
give
up
the
attempt
by
even
curtis
have
accepted
the
idea
that
federation
be
a
very
remote
possibility
although
in
his
case
at
least
it
remain
as
the
beckoning
will
o
the
wisp
by
which
all
lesser
goal
be
measure
and
found
vaguely
dissatisfy
the
third
string
to
the
bow
imperial
cooperation
remain
it
become
in
time
the
chief
concern
of
the
group
the
story
of
these
effort
be
a
familiar
one
and
no
attempt
will
be
make
here
to
repeat
it
we
be
concerned
only
with
the
role
played
by
the
milner
group
in
these
effort
in
general
this
role
be
very
large
if
not
decisive
the
proposal
for
imperial
cooperation
have
as
their
basic
principle
the
assumption
that
community
which
have
a
common
ideology
could
pursue
parallel
course
toward
the
same
goal
merely
by
consultation
among
their
leader
for
a
long
time
the
milner
group
do
not
see
that
the
great
the
degree
of
success
obtain
by
this
method
the
more
remote
be
the
possibility
that
federation
could
ever
be
attain
it
be
very
likely
that
the
group
be
mislead
in
this
by
the
fact
that
they
be
for
many
year
extremely
fortunate
in
keep
member
of
the
group
in
position
of
power
and
influence
in
the
dominion
as
long
as
men
like
smut
botha
who
do
what
smut
want
duncan
feetham
or
long
be
in
influential
position
in
south
africa
as
long
as
men
like
eggleston
bavin
or
dudley
braham
be
influential
in
australia
as
long
as
men
like
glazebrook
massey
joseph
flavelle
or
percy
corbett
be
influential
in
canada
in
a
nutshell
as
long
as
member
of
the
milner
group
be
influential
throughout
the
dominion
the
technique
of
the
parallel
policy
of
cooperation
would
be
the
easy
way
to
reach
a
common
goal
unfortunately
this
be
not
a
method
that
could
be
expect
to
continue
forever
and
when
the
milner
group
grow
old
and
weaker
it
could
not
be
expect
that
their
newer
recruit
in
england
like
hodson
coupland
astor
woodward
elton
and
others
could
continue
to
work
on
a
parallel
policy
with
the
newer
arrival
to
power
in
the
dominion
when
that
unhappy
day
arrive
the
milner
group
should
have
have
institutionalize
mode
of
procedure
firmly
establish
they
do
not
not
because
they
do
not
want
them
but
because
their
member
in
the
dominion
could
not
have
remain
in
influential
position
if
they
have
insist
on
create
institutionalize
link
with
britain
when
the
people
of
the
dominion
obviously
do
not
want
such
link
the
use
of
colonial

imperial

a
method
for

although

could
have
be

in
the

indeed
it

out
that
the

a
the
reign
of

in
dicey
s

out
the

when
asquith
squelch
sir
john
ward
suggestion
for
the
creation
of
an
imperial
council
although
doubtless
from
quite
a
different
motivation
at
the
conference
of
as

the

waste
motion
the
conference
of
be
not
held
because
of
the

but
as
soon
as
milner
come
into
the
government
in
december
the
round

argument
that
the

should
be
use
as
a
mean
for
consolidate
the

rather
than
as
an
excuse
for
postpone

begin
to
take
effect
the
round
table
during
be
agitate
for
an
immediate
imperial
conference
with
indian
participation
for
the
first
time
as
soon
as
milner
join
the
cabinet
in
december
he
sent
out
cable
to
the
dominion
and
to
india
invite
them
to
come
it
be
milner
also
who
create
the
imperial
war
cabinet
by
add
dominion
member
to
the
british
war
cabinet
these
development
be
foretold
and
approve
by
the
round
table
in
its
june
issue
it
say
in
the
course
of
a
long
article
on
new
development
in
the
constitution
of
the
empire
at
a
date
which
cannot
be
far
distant
an
imperial
conference
will
assemble
the
purpose
of
which
will
be
to
consider
what
far
step
can
be
take
to
transform
the
empire
of
a
state
in
which
the
main
responsibility
and
burden
of
its
common
affair
be
sustain
and
control
by
the
united
kingdom
into
a
commonwealth
of
equal
nation
conduct
its
foreign
policy
and
common
affair
by
some
method
of
continuous
consultation
and
concert
action
the
decision
today
be
against
any
federate
reconstruction
after
the
war
it
be
evident
however
that
the
institution
through
which
the
improve
imperial
system
will
chiefly
work
will
be
the
newly
constitute
imperial
cabinet
the
imperial
cabinet
will
be
different
in
some
important
respect
from
the
imperial
conference
it
will
meet
annually
instead
of
once
in
four
year
it
will
be
concerned
more
particularly
with
foreign
policy
which
the
imperial
conference
have
never
yet
discuss
its
proceeding
will
consequently
be
secret
it
will
also
consist
of
the
most
important
british
minister
sit
in
conclave
with
the
overseas
minister
instead
of
the
secretary
of
state
for
the
colony
alone
as
have
be
usually
the
case
hitherto
as
be
well
know
the
imperial
war
cabinet
met
fourteen
time
in
met
again
in
and
assemble
at
paris
in
as
the
british
empire
delegation
to
the
peace
conference
parallel
with
it
the
imperial
war
conference
met
in
london
in
under
the
colonial
secretary
to
discus
nonwar
problem
at
the
meeting
of
the
former
body
it
be
decide
to
hold
annual
meeting
in
the
future
and
to
invite
the
dominion
to
establish
resident
minister
in
london
to
insure
constant
consultation
at
a
meeting
in
be
drawn
up
the
famous
imperial
resolution
which
exclude
federation
as
a
solution
o
the
imperial
problem
and
recognize
the
complete
equality
of
the
dominion
and
the
united
kingdom
under
one
king
these
development
be
not
only
acceptable
to
milner
but
apparently
be
largely
engineer
by
him
on
july
he
issue
a
formal
statement
contain
the
sentence
the
only
possibility
of
a
continuance
of
the
british
empire
be
on
a
basis
of
absolute
out
and
out
equal
partnership
between
the
united
kingdom
and
the
dominion
i
say
that
without
any
kind
of
reservation
whatever
when
milner
die
in
may
the
time
obituary
have
this
to
say
about
this
portion
of
his
life
with
the
special
meeting
of
the

attend
by
the

which
begin
on

come
to

and
the
actual
proposal
to
bring
the

premier
into
the

cabinet
be
his
and
when
thanks
to
mr
lloyd
george
ready
acceptance
of
the
proposal
milners
conception
be
realize
it
prove
to
be
not
only
a
solution
of
the
problem
o
imperial
administrative
unity
in
its
then
transient
but
most
urgent
phase
but
a
permanent

far
reach
advance
in
the

at
the

of
its
great

by
milner
with
a
common

in

great
power
from

from

an
indication
o
this
can
be

in

the
various
activity
of

in
respect
to
commonwealth
affair
it
be
possible
to
discern
a
dualistic
attitude
this
attitude
reveals
a
wholehearted
public
acceptance
of
the
exist
constitutional
and
political
relationship
of
great
britain
and
the
dominion
combine
with
an
intense
secret
yearn
for
some
form
of
closer
union
the
realization
that
closer
union
be
not
politically
feasible
in
a
democratic
age
in
which
the
majority
o
person
especially
in
the
dominion
reject
any
effort
to
bind
the
various
part
of
the
empire
together
explains
this
dualism
the
member
of
the
group
as
the
round
table
point
out
in
be
not
convince
of
the
effectiveness
or
workability
of
any
program
of
dominion
relation
base
solely
on
cooperation
without
any
institutional
basis
but
publicly
and
in
the
next
breath
the
group
wholeheartedly
embrace
all
the
development
that
destroyed
one
by
one
the
legal
and
institutional
link
which
bound
the
dominion
to
the
mother
country
in
one
special
field
after
another

defense
economic
cooperation
raw

conservation
war
graf

etc
the
group
eagerly
welcome
effort
to
create
new
institutional
link
between
the
self
govern
portion
o
the
commonwealth
but
all
the
time
the
group
recognize
that
these
innovation
be
unable
to
satisfy
the
yearn
that
burn
in
the
group
collective
heart
only
as
the
second
world
war
begin
to
enter
its
second
and
more
hopeful
half
do
the
group
begin
once
again
to
raise
its
voice
with
suggestion
for
some
more
permanent
organization
of
the
constitutional
side
of
commonwealth
relation
all
of
these
suggestion
be
offer
in
a
timid
and
tentative
fashion
more
or
less
publicly
label
as
trial
balloon
and
usually
preface
by
an
engage
statement
that
the
suggestion
be
the
result
of
the
personal
and
highly
imperfect
idea
of
the
speaker
himself
think
aloud
as
smut
call
it
become
epidemic
among
the
member
o
the
group
these
idle
thought
could
be
thus
easily
repudiate
if
they
fell
on
infertile
or
inhospitable
ground
and
even
the
individual
whence
these
suggestion
emanate
could
hardly
be
held
responsible
for
think
aloud
all
of
these
suggestion
follow
a
similar
pattern
a
reflection
on
the
great
crisis
which
the
commonwealth
survive
in
an
indication
that
this
crisis
require
some
reorganization
of
the
commonwealth
in
order
to
avoid
its
repetition
a
passage
of
high
praise
for
the
exist
structure
of
the
commonwealth
and
an
emphatic
statement
that
the
independence
and
autonomy
of
its
various
member
be
close
to
the
speaker
heart
and
that
nothing
he
suggests
must
be
take
as
imply
any
desire
to
infringe
in
the
slightest
degree
on
that
independence
and
the
suggestion
itself
emerges
the
logical
incompatibility
o
the
four
section
of
the
pattern
be
never
mention
and
if
point
out
by
some
critic
would
undoubtedly
be
excuse
on
the
ground
that
the
english
be
practical
rather
than
logical
an
excuse
behind
which
many
english
even
outside
the
milner
group
frequently
find
refuge
we
shall
give
three
example
of
the
milner
group
suggestion
for
commonwealth
reform
in
the
second
half
of
the
recent
war
they
emanate
from
general
smut
lord
halifax
and
sir
edward
grigg
all
of
them
be
convince
that
the
british
commonwealth
would
be
drastically
weaker
in
the
postwar
world
and
would
require
internal
reorganization
in
order
to
take
its
place
as
a
balance
force
between
the
two
great
power
the
united

and
the
soviet
union
smut
in
an
article
in
the
american
weekly

speech
before
the

branch
of
the

parliamentary
association
in
london
on
november
be
deliberately
vague
but
hop
to
use
the
close
link
between
the
united
kingdom
and
the
dependent
colony
as
a
mean
of
bring

closer
to
the

by
combine
the
dominion
with
the

in

this
plan
have
definite
advantage
although
it
have
be
reject
as
impractical
by
lionel
curtis
in
if
regional

could
be
form
by
divide
the
british

five

a
dominion

region
closely
associate
with
the

in
the

this
could
be
do
without
weaken
the
link
between
the

the

it
would
serve
to
strengthen
the
link
between

dominion
this
latter
goal
be
frankly
admit
by

the
british
commonwealth
appear
also
in
it
be
very
similar
to

even
to
the
use
o
the

verbal

this
expression

derive
from
lord

and
be
attribute
to
this
source
by
sir

to
the
difference
between
the
dependent
and
the
self
govern
portion
of
the
commonwealth
sir
edward
advocate
creation
of
five
regional
bloc
with
western
europe
associate
by
mean
of
a
military
alliance
with
the
united
kingdom
in
one
without
any
sacrifice
of
sovereignty
by
anyone
he
visualize
the
creation
o
a
regional
council
tike
a
miniature
imperial
conference
and
a
joint
parliamentary
assembly
in
three
of
these
region
the
member
o
the
council
would
be
representative

the

would
consist
of
select
member
from
the
exist
national
parliament
in
proper
ratio
and
each
region
would
have
a
permanent
secretariat
to
carry
out

decision
how
this
elaborate
organization
could
be
reconcile
with
the
continuance
of
unrestricted
national
sovereignty

not
indicate
lord
halifax
suggestion
make
in
a
speech
before
the
toronto
board
of
trade
on
january
be
somewhat
different
although
he
clearly
have
the
same
goal
in
view
and
the
same
mental
picture
o
exist
world
condition
he
suggest
that
britain
could
not
maintain
her
position
as
a
great
power
in
the
sense
in
which
the
united
state
and
russia
be
great
power
on
the
basis
o
the
strength
of
the
united
kingdom
alone
accordingly
he
advocate
the
creation
of
some
method
of
coordination
of
foreign
policy
and
measure
o
defense
by
which
the
dominion
could
participate
in
both
and
a
united
front
could
be
offer
to
other
power
that
these
trial
balloon
of
smut
grigg
and
halifax
be
not
their
isolated
personal
reaction
but
be
the
result
of
a
turmoil
of
thought
within
the
milner
group
be
evident
from
the
simultaneous
suggestion
which
appear
in
the
time
editorial
during
the
first
week
in
december
and
the
issue
of
the
round
table
for
the
same
month
the
winnipeg
free
press
a
paper
which
have
frequently
show
knowledge
of
the
existence
of
the
milner
group
in
editorial
o
and
january
point
out
this
effusion
of
suggestion
for
a
reconstruction
of
the
empire
and
say
add
to
the
record
of
earlier
statement
the
halifax
speech
affords
conclusive
evidence
that
there
be
a
powerful
movement
on
foot
in
the
united
kingdom
for
a
commonwealth
which
will
speak
with
a
single
voice
and
it
will
be
note
that
lord
halifax
believe
that
this
change
in
the
structure
of
the
commonwealth

through
all
these
speech
and
article
be
the
clear
note
of
fear
the

be
obsess
by
the
thought
of
power
as
be
the
only
force
that
count
the
world
be
to
be
govern
by

it
be
tragic
that
the
sincere
and
powerful
group
of
public
men
in
england
represent
by
lord
halifax
and
field
marshal
smut
should
react
to
the
problem
of
maintain

in
this
way
these
suggestion
be
met
by
an
uproar
of
protest
that
reach
unnecessary
height
of
denunciation
especially
in
canada
they
be
reject
in

repulse
by

others
in

call
isolationist

by

and
australia
where
fear
o
japan
be
have
a
profound
effect
on
public
opinion
and
in
the
united
kingdom
where
the
milner
group
influence
be
so
extensive
the
suggestion
receive
a
cold
reception
in
south
africa
only
the
cape
time
be
favorable
and
in
canada
the
vancouver
province
lead
a
small
band
of
supporter
as
a
result
the
milner
group
once
again
reject
any
movement
toward
closer
union
it
continued
to
toy
with
griggs
idea
o
regional
bloc
within
the
commonwealth
but
here
it
found
an
almost
insoluble
problem
if
a
regional
bloc
be
to
be
create
in
africa
the
native
of
the
african
colonial
area
would
be
expose
to
the
untender
mercy
of
the
south
african
boer
and
it
would
be
necessary
to
repudiate
the
promise
o
native
welfare
which
the
group
have
support
in
the
kenya
white
paper
of
its
resistance
to
boer
influence
in
the
three
native
protectorate
in
south
africa
the
implication
in
favor
of
native
welfare
in
the
african
survey
of
and
the
frequent
pronouncement
of
the
round
table
on
the
paramount
importance
of
protect
native
right
such
a
repudiation
be
highly
unlikely
and
indeed
be
specifically
reject
by
grigg
himself
in
his
book
the
milner
group
itself
have

intensify
the
decentralize

in
the

of

this
influence
be
most
significant
in

to
india
palestine
ireland
and
egypt
each
o
which
be
separate
from

by
a

in
which
the

be
a

the

of
these
be
so
significant
that
it
will
be
discuss
in

chapter
but
a
few
word
should
be
say
about
the
other
three
here
the
milner

have
relatively
little
to
do
with
the

lack

the

exercise
a
certain
amount
of
influence
in

to
palestine
because
o
its
general
power
in
the

because
palestine
be
administer
through
the
colonial
office
where
the
milner
group
influence
be
considerable
the
general
attitude
of
the
milner
group
be
neither
pro
arab
nor
pro
zionist
although
tend
i
at
all
toward
the
latter
rather
than
the
former
the
group
be
never
anti
semitic
and
not
a
shred
o
evidence
in
this
direction
have
be
found
in
fact
they
be
very
sympathetic
to
the
jew
and
to
their
legitimate
aspiration
to
overcome
their
fate
but
this
feel
it
must
be
confess
be
rather
general
and
remote
and
they
do
not
in
their
personal
life
have
much
real
contact
with
jew
or
any
real
appreciation
o
the
finer
quality
o
those
people
their
feel
against
anti
semitism
be
on
the
whole
remote
and
academic
on
the
other
hand
as
with
most
upper
class
english
their
feel
for
the
arab
be
somewhat
more
personal
many
member
of
the
group
have
be
in
arab
country
found
their
personal
relationship
with
the
arab
enjoyable
and
be
attract
to
them
however
this
attraction
o
the
arab
never
inclined
the
milner
group
toward
that
pro
arab
romanticism
that
be
to
be
found
in
people
like
w
s
blunt
or
t
e
lawrence
the
reluctance
of
the
milner
group
to
push
the
zionist
cause
in
palestine
be
base
on
more
academic
consideration
chiefly
two
in
number
the
feel
that
it
would
not
be
fair
to
allow
the
bustling
minority
o
zionist
to
come
into
palestine
and
drive
the
arab
either
out
or
into
an
inferior
economic
and
social
position
and
the
feel
that
to
do
this
would
have
the
effect
of
alienate
the
arab
from
western
and
especially
british
culture
and
that
this
would
be
especially
likely
to
occur
if
the
jew
obtain
control
of
the
mediterranean
coast
from
egypt
to
syria
strangely
enough
there
be
little
evidence
that
the
milner
group
be
activate
by
strategic
or
economic
consideration
at
all
thus
the
widely
disseminate
charge
that
britain
fail
to
support
zionism
in
palestine
because
of
anti
semitism
or
strategic
and
economic
consideration
be
not
support
by
any
evidence
found
within
the
milner
group
this
may
be
true
of
other
section
of
british
public
opinion
and
certainly
be
true
of
the
british
labour
party
where
the
existence
of
anti
semitism
as
an
influence
seem
clearly
establish
in
palestine
as
in
india
and
probably
in
ireland
the
policy
of
the
milner
group
seem
to
have
be
motivate
by
good
intention
which
alienate
the
contend
party
encourage
extremism
and
weaken
british
influence
with
both
in
the
long
run
this
policy
be
proarab
just
as
in
india
it
be
pro
moslem
and
in
both
case
it
serve
to
encourage
an
uncompromising
obstructionism
which
could
have
be
avoid
if
britain
have
merely
apply
the
principle
to
which
she
stood
commit
the
attitude
of
the
milner
group
toward
the
arab
and
jew
can
be
see
from
some
quotation
from
member
o
the
group
at
the
peace
conference
o
discuss
the
relative
merit
of
the
jew
and
arab
smut
say
they
have
not
the
arab
attractive
manner
they
do
not
warm
the
heart
by
graceful
subjection
they
make
demand
they
be
a
bitter
recalcitrant
little
people
and
like
the
boer
impatient
of
leadership
and
ruinously
quarrelsome
among
themselves
they
see
god
in
the

potentate
a
few
year
later
john
dove
in
a
letter
to
brand
ask
himself
why
there
be
so
much
proarab
feel
among
the
british
especially
the
public
school
caste
and
attribute
it
to
the
arab
good
manner
derive
from
desert
life
and
their
love
for
sport
especially
rid
and
shoot
both
close
to
the
heart
of
the
public
school
boy
a
little
later
in
another
letter
also
write
from
palestine
dove
declare
that
the
whole
arab
world
should
be
in
one
state
and
it
must
have
syria
and
palestine
for
its
front
door
not
be
like
south
africa
with
delagoa
bay
in
other
hand
the
arab
world
he
explain
need
this
western
door
because
we
be
try
to
westernize
the
arab
and
without
it
they
would
be
driven
to
the
east
and
to
india
which
they
hate
he
conclude
i
the
arab
belongs
to
the
mediterranean
as
t
e
lawrence
insists
we
should
do
nothing
to
stop
him
get
back
to
it
why
our
own
nostrum
for
the
ill
of
mankind
everywhere
be
western
civilization
and
if
it
be
a
sound
one
what
would
be
the
good
of
force
a
people
who
want
direct
contact
with
us
to
slink
in
and
out
of
their
country
by
a
back
door
which
like
the
persian
gulf
open
only
on
the
east
it
would
certainly
check
development
if
it
do
not
actually
warp
it
i
suggest
then
that
partition
should
not
be
permanent
but
this
do
not
mean
that
a
stage
of
friendly
tutelage
be
necessarily
a
bad
thing
for
the
arab
on
the
contrary
advanced
people
can
give
so
much
to
stimulate
backward
one
if
they
do
it
with
judgment
and
sympathy
above
all
it
must
not
be
the
kind
of
help
which
kill
individuality
personally
i
do
not
see
the
slightest
harm
in
jew
come
to
palestine
under
reasonable
condition
they
be
the
arab
cousin
as
much
as
the
phoenician
and
if
zionism
brings
capital
and
labour
which
will
enable
industry
to
start
it
will
add
to
the
strength
of
the
large
unit
which
some
day
be
go
to
include
palestine
but
they
must
be
content
to
be
part
of
such
a
potential
unit
they
need
have
no
fear
of
absorption
for
they
have
everything
to
gain
from
an
arab
federation
it
would
mean
a
far
large
field
for
their
activity
the
attitude
of
the
milner
group
toward
the
specific
problem
of
zionism
be
express
in
explicit
term
by
lord
milner
himself
in
a
speech
in
the
house
of
lord
on
june
after
express
his
wholehearted
agreement
with
the
policy
of
the
british
government
as
reveal
in
its
action
and
in
its
statement
like
the
balfour
declaration
and
the
white
paper
of
cmd
he
add
i
be
not
speak
of
the
policy
which
be
advocate
by
the
extreme
zionist
which
be
a
totally
different
thing
i
believe
that
we
have
only
to
go
on
steadily
with
the
policy
of
the
balfour
declaration
as
we
have
ourselves
interpeted
it
in
order
to
see
great
material
progress
in
palestine
and
a
gradual
subsistence
of
the
present
arab
agitation
the
force
of
which
it
would
be
foolish
to
deny
but
which
i
believe
to
be
largely
due
to
artificial
stimulus
and
to
a
very
great
extent
to
be
excite
from
without
the
symptom
of
any
real
and
general
dissatisfaction
among
the
mass
o
the
arab
population
with
the
condition
under
which
they
live
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
discover
there
be
plenty
of
room
in
that
country
for
a
considerable
immigrant
population
without
injure
in
any
way
the
resident
arab
population
and
indeed
in
many
way
it
would
tend
to
their
extreme
benefit
there
be
about
people
in
palestine
and
there
be
room
for
several
million
i
be
and
always
have
be
a
strong
supporter
of
the
pro
arab
policy
which
be
first
advocate
in
this
country
in
the
course
of
the
war
i
believe
in
the
independence
of
the
arab
country
which
they
owe
to
us
and
which
they
can
only
maintain
with
our
help
i
look
forward
to
an
arab
federation
i
be
convince
that
the
arab
will
make
a
great
mistake
in
claim
palestine
as
a
part
of
the
arab
federation
in
the
same
sense
as
be
the
other
country
of
the
near
east
which
be
mainly
inhabit
by
arab
he
then
go
on
to
say
that
he
felt
that
palestine
would
require
a
permanent
mandate
and
under
that
condition
could
become
a
national
home
for
the
jew
could
take
as
many
jewish
immigrant
as
the
country
could
economically
support
but
must
never
become
a
jewish
state
this
be
the
point
of
view
of
the
milner
group
and
it
remain
the
point
of
view
of
the
british
government
until
like
the
milner
group
point
of
view
on
other
issue
it
be
essentially
fair
compromise
and
well
intentioned
it
broke
down
in
palestine
because
of
the
obstructionism
of
the
arab
the
intention
of
the
zionist
to
have
political
control
of
their
national
home
if
they
get
one
the
pressure
on
both
jew
and
arab
from
the
world
depression
after
and
the
need
for
a
refuge
from
hitler
for
european
jew
after
the
milner
group
do
not
approve
of
the
effort
of
the
labour
government
in
to
curtail
zionist
right
in
palestine
they

against

that
the

insensitiveness

of
this
pressure

interpret
the
document
in
a
more
moderate
fashion

might
be
expect
in
view
of
the
position
of
reginald
coupland
on
the

the
report
of
that
commission
met
with
a
most
enthusiastic
reception
from
the
milner
group
this
report
be
a
scholarly
study
of
condition
in
palestine
o
a
type
usually
found
in
any
document
with
which
the
milner
group
have
direct
contact
for
the
first
time
in

the
aspiration
o
jew
and
arab
in
palestine
be
declare
to
be
irreconcilable
and
the
exist

unworkable
accordingly
the

recommend
the

of

into
a
jewish
state
an
arab
state
and
a
neutral
enclave
contain

this
suggestion
be
accepted
by
the
british
government
in
a
white
paper

through

from
leopold

amery
speech
in
support
of
this
motion
be
extremely
interest
and
be
actually
an
evolution
under
the
pressure
o
hard
fact
from
the
point
o
view
described
by
lord
milner
in
amery
say
however
much
we
may
regret
it
we
have
lose
the
situation
in
palestine
as
we
lose
it
in
ireland
through
a
lack
of
wholehearted
faith
in
ourselves
and
through
the
constitutional
inability
of
the
individual
briton
and
indeed
of
the
country
as
a
whole
not
to
see
the
other
fellow
point
of
view
and
to
be
influence
by
it
even
to
the
detriment
of
any
consistent
policy
accord
to
amery
the
idea
of
partition
occur
to
the
peel
commission
only
after
it
have
left
palestine
and
the
report
be
already
write
thus
the
commission
be
unable
to
hear
any
direct
evidence
on
this
question
or
make
any
examination
of
how
partition
should
be
carry
out
in
detail
he
say
of
the
page
of
the
report
almost
the
whole
of
the
first
page
include
the
whole
of
chapter
to
represent
an
earlier
report
of
an
entirely
different
character
that
earlier
report
envisage
the
continuation
of
the
mandate
in
its
present
form
throughout
all
these
chapter
to
which
i
have
refer
the
whole
text
of
the
chapter
deal
with
the
assumption
that
the
mandate
be
continued
but
here
and
there
at
the
end
of
some
chapter
there
be
tacked
on
in
a
quite
obviously
add
last
paragraph
something
to
this
effect
all
the
rest
of
the
chapter
before
be
something
that
might
have
be
consider
if
as
a
matter
of
fact
we
be
not
go
to
pursue
an
entirely
different
policy
these
last
paragraph
be
obviously
add
by
the
secretary
or
whoever
help
draft
the
report
after
the
main
great
conclusion
be
reach
at
a
very
late
stage
since
the
milner
group
support
partition
in
palestine
as
they
have
earlier
in
ireland
and
as
they
do
later
in
india
it
be
not
too
much
to
believe
that
coupland
add
the
additional
paragraph
after
the
commission
have
return
to
england
and
he
have
have
an
opportunity
to
discus
the
matter
with
other
member
o
the
inner
circle
in
fact
amery
s
remark
be
probably
base
on
knowledge
rather
than
internal
textual
evidence
and
be
aim
to
get
the
motion
accepted
with
the
understand
that
it
approve
no
more
than
the
principle
of
partition
with
the
detail
to
be
examine
by
another
commission
later
this
in
fact
be
what
be
do
amery
speech
be
also
interest
for
its
friendly
reference
to
the
jew
he
say
that
in
the
past
the
arab
have
obtain
percent
of
what
they
be
promise
while
the
jew
have
receive
a
raw
deal
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
jew
have
a
much
great
need
of
the
country
and
would
make
the
best
use
of
the
land
to
carry
out
the
policy
of
partition
the
government
appoint
a
new
royal
commission
of
four
member
in
march
know
as
the
woodhead
commission
this
body
have
no
member
of
either
the
milner
group
or
the
cecil
bloc
on
it
and
its
report
cmd
reject
partition
as
impractical
on
the
ground
that
any
acceptable
method
of
partition
into
two
state
would
give
a
jewish
state
with
an
annual
financial
surplus
and
an
arab
state
with
an
annual
financial
deficit
this
conclusion
be
accepted
by
the
government
in
another
white
paper
cmd
of
as
an
alternative
the
government
call
a
round
table
conference
o
jew
and
arab
from
palestine
along
with
representative
of
the
arab
state
outside
of
palestine
during
all
this
the
arab
have
be
grow
increasingly
violent
they
refuse
to
accept
the
peel
report
they
boycott
the
woodhead
commission
and
they
finally
broke
into
open
civil
war
in
such
condition
nothing
be
accomplish
at
the
round
table
meeting
at
london
in
february
march
the
arab
delegation
include
leader
who
have
to
be
release
from
prison
in
order
to
come
and
who
refuse
to
sit
in
the
same
conference
with
the
jew
compromise
proposal
present
by
the
government
be
reject
by
both
side
after
the
conference
broke
up
the
government
issue
a
new
statement
of
policy
cmd
of
may
it
be
a
drastic
reversal
of
previous
statement
and
be
obviously
a
turn
in
favor
of
the
arab
it
fix
jewish
immigration
into
palestine
at
for
the
whole
of
the
next
five
year
include
illegal
immigration
and
give
the
arab
a
veto
on
any
jewish
immigration
after
the
five
year
period
be
finish
as
a
matter
of
principle
it
shift
the
basis
for
jewish
immigration
from
the
old
criterion
of
the
economic
absorptive
capacity
of
palestine
to
the
political
absorptive
capacity
this
be
really
an
invitation
to
the
arab
to
intensify
their
agitation
and
constitute
a
vital
blow
at
the
jew
since
it
be
generally
concede
that
jewish
immigration
increase
the
economic
absorptive
capacity
for
both
jew
and
arab
the
milner
group
be
divide
on
this
concrete

the

played
a
much
more
decisive

attitude
be
quite
different
and
he
thoroughly
disapprove
of
carson
plot
this
difference
be
an
indication
of
the
difference
in
point
o
view
in
regard
to
ireland
between
the
milner
group
and
the
cecil

be
willing
to
oppose

even
to
the
point
where
it
would
condone
illegal
action
the
former
on
the
contrary
be
in
favor
of
home
rule
because
it
believe
that
ireland
would
aid
britain
enemy
in
every
crisis
and
leave
the
commonwealth
at
the
first
opportunity
unless
it
be
give
freedom
to
govern
itself
the
milner
group
attitude
toward
the
irish
question
be
express
by
the
round
table
in
a
retrospective
article
in
the
september
issue
in
the
follow
word
the
root
principle
of
the
round
table
remain
freedom
the
government
o
men
by
themselves
and
it
demand
that
within

this
principle
should
be
persistently
pursue
and

in

that
reason
it
denounce
the

the

demand
for

self
government
by
ruthless
violence
after
a
century
o

have
fail
to
win
irish
consent
as
a
policy
in
conflict
with
british
institution
and
inconsistent
with
the
principle
of
the
british
commonwealth
and
it
played
its
part
in
achieve
the
irish
treaty
and
the
dominion
settlement
the
part
which
the
group
played
in
the
irish
settlement
be
considerably
more
than
this
brief
passage
might
indicate
but
it
could
not
take
effect
until
the
group
in
britain
advocate
repression
and
the
group
in
ireland
advocate
separation
from
the
crown
have
brought
each
other
to
some
realization
o
the
advantage
of
compromise
these
advantage
be
point
out
by
the
group
especially
by
lionel
curtis
who
begin
a
two
year
term
as
editor
of

this

an

the
ultimate
victory
of
their

it
be
a
development
which
the

be
powerless
to
prevent
they
continued
to

unfortunately
such
christian
tactic
be
acutely
dangerous
in

in

respect
the

this
become
clear
during

when
the
inability
of
the
british
to

to

that
the

they
nevertheless
be
among

to
this
day

the

in
its

it
be
the
legitimate

in

all
three
receive
their
initial

to
the

as
merely
one
among

however
the
fact
that

have
be
publicly
state
by

by

a

of
a

for

year
to
advance
the
study
group
method
of
research
this
be
extend
for
five
year
more
in
in
lionel
curtis
get
a
canadian
colonel
r
w
leonard
so
interested
in
the
work
of
the
institute
that
he
bought
lord
kinnaird
house
at
st
james
square
as
a
home
for
the
institute
since
william
pitt
have
once
live
in
the
building
it
be
name
chatham
house
a
designation
which
be
now
generally
apply
to
the
institute
itself
the
only
condition
of
the
grant
be
that
the
institute
should
raise
an
endowment
to
yield
at
least
a
year
for
upkeep
since
the

have
no
adequate
assembly
hall
sir
john

give
to
build

renovate
and
furnish
under
the
care
of
mr
alfred
lyttelton
who
like
her
late
husband
but
unlike
her
son
oliver
be
a
member
of
the
milner
group
the
assumption
o
the
title
to
chatham
house
brought
up
a
major
crisis
within
the
institute
when
a
group
lead
by
professor
a
f
pollard
fellow
of
all
soul
but
not
a
member
of
the
milner
group
oppose
the
acceptance
o
the
gift
because
o
the
financial
commitment
involve
curtis
put
on
an
organize
drive
to
mobilize
the
group
and
put
the
opposition
to
flight
the
episode
be
mention
in
a
letter
from
john
dove
to
brand
date
october
this
episode
open
up
the
whole
question
o
the
financial
resource
available
to
the
institute
and
to
the
milner
group
in
general
unfortunately
we
cannot
examine
the
subject
here
but
it
should
be
obvious
that
a
group
with
such
connection
as
the
milner
group
would
not
find
it
difficult
to
finance
the
riia
in
general
the
fund
come
from
the
various
endowment
bank
and
industrial
concern
with
which
the
milner
group
have
relationship
the
original
money
in
only
come
from
abe
bailey
in
later
year
he
add
to
this
and
in
give
a
year
in
perpetuity
on
the
condition
that
the
institute
never
accept
member
who
be
not
british
subject
when
sir

die
in
the

with
the
passing
of
sir

the
loss
of
their
most
munificent
founder
sir

have
paid
various
other
expense
during
the

for

when
the

november
give
a
dinner
to

the
cost

o
that

must
be
obvious

purpose
of
this

have
be
something
else
to
show
that
the
milner

control
the

once
that
be
establish
the
picture
change
the
influence
of
chatham
house
appear
in
its
true
perspective
not
as
the
influence
of
an
autonomous
body
but
as
merely
one
of
many
instrument
in
the
arsenal
o
another
power
when
the
influence
which
the
institute
wields
be
combine
with
that
control
by
the
milner
group

field
in

in
newspaper

periodical
a
really
terrify
picture
begin
to
emerge
this
picture
be
call
terrify
not
because
the
power
of
the

be
use
for
evil
end
it
be
not
on
the
contrary
it
be
generally
use
with
the
best
intention
in
the
world
even
if
those
intention
be
so
idealistic
as
to
be
almost
academic
the
picture
be
terrify
because
such
power
whatever
the
goal
at
which
it
may
be
direct
be
too
much
to
be

any
group
that
it
be
too
much
to
be
safely
entrust
to
the
milner
group
will
appear
quite
clearly
in
chapter
no
country
that
value
its
safety
should
allow
what
the
milner
group
accomplish
in
britain
that
be
that
a
small
number
of
men
should
be
able
to
wield
such
power
in
administration
and
politics

in

even
to

another
indication
of
asquith
s
feel
toward
the

can
be
found
in

under

told

that
he
have
not
expect
to
live
to
see
the
day
when
the
best
safeguard
for
true
liberalism
would
be
found
in
an
unreformed
house
of
lord
and
the
cecil
family
in
however
the
situation
be
somewhat
different
and
asquith
could
hardly
be
call
a
member
of
the
cecil
bloc
in
a
somewhat
similar
situation
although
much
closer

also
a
member

a
peripheral
fashion
but
held
his
appointment
through
a
family
claim
on
the
governor
generalship
rather
than
by
favor
of
the
cecils
the
act

however
while
not
a
product
of
the
group
with
which
we
be
concerned
be
form
in
the

social
tradition
drawn
up
from
the

intellectual

social
outlook

put
into

fashion
it
legalize

their
membership

the

be
allot
to
communal
group
with
the
minority
like
moslem

more
than
their
proportionate

moslem

in

this

only
slight
change

the
only
one
of
these
act
whose
secret
legislative
background
be
no
longer
a
secret
and
it
be
the
only
one
which
indicate
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
british
government
to
establish
in
india
a
responsible

pattern
on

the

some
person
both
at
the
time
and
since
have
believe
it
be
among
these
person
would
appear
to
be
lord

for
in
debate
in

six
week
before
i
go
out
again
as

and
when
i
get
home
i
found
that
there
be
a
committee
in
existence
at
the
india
office
which
be
consider
on
what
line
future

committee
before
my
return
in
the
middle
of
march
give
me
a
pamphlet

in
broad
outline
the
view
which
be
held
with
regard
to
future
constitutional

when
i
reach
india
i
show
this
pamphlet
to
my

also
to
my

friend
lord

who
be
then
lieutenant
governor
of

it
contain
what
be
now
know
as
the
diarchic
principle
both
the
council
and
lord
meston
who
be
then
sir
james
meston
report
adversely
on
the
proposal
for
constitutional
development
contain
in
that
pamphlet
lord
chelmsford
then
go
on
to
say
that
austen
chamberlain
combat
their
objection
with
the
argument
that
the
indian
must
acquire
experience
in
self
government
so
after
the
announcement
to
this
effect
be
make
publicly
in
august
the
official
in
india
accepted
dyarchy
if
lord
chelmsford
believe
that
the
pamphlet
be
an
official
document
from
a
committee
in
the
india
office
he
be
in
error
the
other
side
of
the
story
be
reveal
by
lionel
curtis
in
in
his
book
dyarchy
accord
to
curtis
the
study
group
be
originally
form
to
help
him
write
the
chapter
on
india
in
the
plan
second
volume
o
the
commonwealth
of
nation
it
set
as
its
task
to
enquire
how
selfgovernment
could
be
introduce
and
peacefully
extend
to
india
the
group
met
once
a
fortnight
in
london
and
soon
decide
on
the
dyarchy
principle
this
principle
as
any
reader
of
curtis
writing
know
be
basic
in
curtis
s
political
thought
and
be
the
foundation
on
which
he
hop
to
build
a
federate
empire
accord
to
curtis
the
study
group
ask
itself
could
not
provincial
electorate
through
legislature
and
minister
of
their
own
be
make
clearly
responsible
for
certain
function
of
government
to
begin
with
leave
all
others
in
the
hand
of
executive
responsible
as
at
present
to
the
government
of
india
and
the
secretary
of
state
indian
electorate
legislature
and
executive
would
thus
be
give
a
field
for
the
exercise
of
genuine
responsibility
from
time
to
time
fresh
power
could
be
transfer
from
the
old
government
as
the
new
elective
authority
developed
and
prove
their
capacity
for
assume
them
from
this
point
of
view
curtis
ask
duke
to
draw
up
such
a
plan
of
devolution
for
bengal
this
plan
be
print
by
the
group
circulate
and
criticize
in
typical
milner
group
fashion
then
the
whole
group
go
to
oxford
for
three
day
and
met
to
discus
it
in
the
old
bursary
o
trinity
college
it
be
then
rewrite
no
one
be
satisfied
it
be
decide
to
circulate
it
for
far
criticism
among
the
round
table
group
throughout
the
world
but
lord
chelmsford
write
from
new
south
wale
and
ask
for
a
copy
apparently
realize
that
he
be
to
be
the
next
viceroy
o
india
the
group
sent
a
copy
to
him
and
none
to
the
round
table
group
l
the
public
get
hold
of
it
and
embarrass
him
it
be
clear
that
chelmsford
be
commit
to
a
program
o
reform
along
these
or
similar
line
before
he
go
out
as
viceroy
this
be
reveal
in
debate
in
the
house
of
lord
by
lord
crewe
on
december
after
chelmsford
go
to
india
in
march
a
new
revise
version
of
the
study
group
plan
be
drawn
up
and
sent
to
him
in
may
another
copy
be
sent
to
canada
to
catch
up
with
curtis
who
have
already
left
for
india
by
way
of
canada
australia
and
new
zealand
this
itinerary
be
undoubtedly
follow
by
curtis
in
order
to
consult
with
member
of
the
group
in
various
country
especially
with
brand
in
canada
on
his
arrival
in
india
curtis
write
back
to
kerr
in
london
the
factor
which
impressed
me
most
in
canada
new
zealand
and
australia
be
the
root
aversion
these
people
have
to
any
scheme
which
meant
their
share
in
the
government
of
india
to
these
young
democratic
community
the
principle
of
self
government
be
the
breath
of
their
nostril
it
be
almost
a
religion
they
feel
as
if
there
be
something
inherently
wrong
in
one
people
ruling
another
it
be
the
same
feel
as
that
which
make
the
american
dislike
govern
the
philippine
and
decline
to
restore
order
in
mexico
my
first
impression
on
this
subject
be
stongly
confirm
on
my
recent
visit
to
these
dominion
i
scarcely
recall
one
of
the
numerous
meeting
i
address
at
which
i
be
not
ask
why
india
be
not
give
self
government
and
what
step
be
be
take
in
that
direction
apparently
this
experience
strengthen
curtis
idea
that
india
must
be
give
responsible
government
he
probably
felt
that
by
give
india
what
it
and
the
dominion
want
for
india
both
would
be
bound
in
loyalty
more
closely
to
britain
in
this
same
letter
to
kerr
curtis
say
in
obvious
reference
to
the
round
table
group
our
task
then
be
to
bring
home
to
the
public
in
the
united
kingdom
and
the
dominion
how
india
differs
from
a
country
like
great
britain
on
the
one
hand
and
from
central
africa
on
the
other
and
how
that
difference
be
now
reflect
in
the
character
of
its
government
we
must
outline
clearly
the
problem
which
arise
from
the
contact
of
east
and
west
and
the
disaster
which
awaits
a
failure
to
supply
their
adequate
solution
by
realize
and
express
the
principle
of
government
for
which
we
stand
we
must
then
go
on
to
suggest
a
treatment
of
india
in
the
general
work
of
imperial
reconstruction
in
harmony
with
the
fact
adduce
in
the
forego
chapter
and
all
this
must
be
do
with
the
closest
attention
to
its
effect
upon
educate
opinion
here
we
must
do
our
best
to
make
indian
nationalist
realize
the
truth
that
like
south
africa
all
their
hope
and
aspiration
be
dependent
on
the
maintenance
of
the
british
commonwealth
and
their
permanent
membership
therein
this
letter
write
on
november
be
address
to
philip
kerr
but
be
intend
for
all
the
member
of
the
group
sir
valentine
chirol
correct
the
draft
and
copy
be
make
available
or
meston
and
marri
then
curtis
have
a
thousand
copy
print
and
sent
to
kerr
for
distribution
in
some
way
the
extremist
indian
nationalist
obtain
a
copy
of
the
letter
and
publish
a
distort
version
of
it
they
claimed
that
a
powerful
and
secret
group
organize
about
the
round
table
have
sent
curtis
to
india
to
spy
out
the
nationalist
plan
in
order
to
obstruct
them
certain
sentence
from
the
letter
be
torn
from
their
context
to
prove
this
argument
among
these
be
the
reference
to
central
africa
which
be
present
to
the
indian
people
as
a
statement
that
they
be
as
uncivilized
and
as
incapable
of
selfgovernment
as
central
african
as
a
result
of
the
fear
create
by
this
rumor
the
indian
national
congress
and
the
moslem
league
form
their
one
and
only
formal
alliance
in
the
shape
o
the
famous
lucknow
compact
of
december
the
curtis
letter
be
not
the
only
factor
behind
the
lucknow
agreement
but
it
be
certainly
very
influen
tial
curtis
be
present
at
the
congress
meeting
and
be
horrify
at
the
version
o
his
letter
which
be
circulate
accordingly
he
publish
the
correct
version
with
an
extensive
commentary
under
the
title
letter
to
the
people
of
india
in
this
he
say
categorically
that
he
believe
that
it
be
the
duty
of
those
who
govern
the
whole
british
commonwealth
to
do
anything
in
their
power
to
enable
indian
to
govern
themselves
as
soon
as
possible
that
indian
must
also
come
to
share
in
the
government
of
the
british
commonwealth
as
a
whole
m
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
curtis
be
sincere
in
this
and
that
his
view
reflect
perhaps
in
an
extreme
form
the
view
of
a
large
and
influential
group
in
great
britain
the
failure
of
this
group
to
persuade
the
indian
nationalist
that
they
be
sincere
be
one
of
the
great
disaster
of
the
century
although
the
fault
be
not
entirely
theirs
and
must
be
share
by
others
include
gandhi
in
the
first
few
month
o

in
that

it
be
clear
that
some
one
other
than
curzon
have
a
hand
in

the

probability
would
be
milner
who
be
with

in
the
war
cabinet
at

the
fact
be
that
curzon
could
not
have
drawn
it
up
alone
unless
he
be
unbelievably
careless
because
after
it

he

horrify
when

curtis

afterwards
suggest
in
the

that
i
have
actually
draft
the
report
my
prompt
denial
have
not
prevent
a
far
complaint
from
many
quarter
that
lord
chelmsford
and
mr
montagu
be
unduly
influence
by
an
irresponsible
tourist
with
the
exception
o
lord
chelmsford
himself
i
be
possibly
the
only
person
in
india
with
firsthand
knowledge
of
responsible
government
as
apply
in
the
dominion
to
the
institution
of
province
whether
my
knowledge
o
india
entitle
me
to
advance
my
view
be
more
open
to
question
of
this
the
reader
can
judge
for
himself
but
in
any
case
the
interview
be
unsought
by
me
thus
curtis
do
not
deny
the
accusation
that
he
be
chiefly
responsible
for
dyarchy
it
be
believe
at
the
time
by
person
in
a
position
to
know
that
he
be
and
these
person
be
both
for
and
against
the
plan
on
the
latter
side
we
might
quote
lord

who
as
a
former
act
viceroy
as
private
secretary
to
joseph
chamberlain

in

o
lord
in
the
incredible
fact
be
that
but
for
the
chance
visit
to
india
of
a
globe
trot
doctrinaire
with
a
positive
mania
for
constitution
monger
nobody
in
the
world
would
ever
have
thought
of
so
peculiar
a
notion
as
dyarchy
and
yet
the
joint
committee
tell
us
in
an
airy
manner
that
no
well
plan
can
be
conceive
the
joint
committee
favorable
report
on
the
dyarchy
bill
be
probably
not
unconnected
with
the
fact
that
five
out
o
fourteen
member
be
from
the
cecil

or
milner
group
that
the

have
in
his
day
preside
over
meeting
of
the
round
table
group
and
be
regard
by
them
as
their

that
the

spent
most
of
its

hearing
witness
who
be
close
to
the

the

almost
four

stanley

in
the

of

the
burden
of
debate
on

both
refer
to
lionel
curtis
the
former
say
it
be
suggest
in
some
quarter
that
this
bill
arose
spontaneously
in
the
mind
of
the
viceroy
and
myself
without
previous
inquiry
or
consideration
under
the
influence
of
mr
lionel
curtis
i
have
never
yet
be
able
to
understand
that
you
approach
the
merit
of
any
discussion
by
vain
effort
to
approximate
to
its
authorship
i
do
not
even
now
understand
that
india
or
the
empire
owes
anything
more
or
less
than
a
great
debt
of
gratitude
to
the
patriotic
and
devote
service
mr
curtis
have
give
to
the
consideration
of
this
problem
sir
henry
craik
later
say
i
be
glad
to
join
in
the
compliment
paid
to
our
mutual
friend
mr
lionel
curtis
who
belongs
to
a
very
active
and
a
very
important
body
of
young
men
whom
i
should
be
the
last
to
criticize
i
be
proud
to
know
him
and
to
pay
that
respect
to
him
due
from
age
to
youth
he
and
others
of
the
company
of
the
round
table
have
be
do
good
work
and
part
of
that
good
work
have
be
do
in
india
mr
fisher
have
nothing
to
say
about
lionel
curtis
but
have
considerable
to
say
about
the
bill
and
the
montagu
chelmsford
report
he
say
there
be
nothing
in
this
bill
which
be
not
contain
in
that
report
that
report
be
not
only
a
very
able
and
eloquent
state
paper
but
it
be
also
one
of
the
great
state
paper
which
have
be
produce
in
anglo
indian
history
and
it
be
an
open
mind
candid
state
paper
a
state
paper
which
do
not
ignore
or
gloss
over
the
point
of
criticism
which
have
since
be
elaborate
in
the
voluminous
document
which
have
be
submit
to
us
he
add
a
moment
later
this
be
a
great
bill
the
round
table
which
also
approve
of
the
bill
as
might
be
imagine
refer
to
fisher
speech
in
its
issue
of
september
and
call
him
so
high
an
authority
the
editor
of
that
issue
be
lionel
curtis
in
the
house
of
lord
there
be
less
enthusiasm
chief
criticism
center
on
two
basic
point
both
of
which
originate
with
curtis
the
principle
of
dyarchy
that
be
that
government
could
be
separate
into
two
class
of
activity
under
different
regime
and
the
effort
to
give
india
responsible
government
rather
than
merely
self
government
that
be
the
effort
to
extend
to
india
a
form
of
government
pattern
on
britain
both
of
these
principle
be
criticize
vigorously
especially
by
member
of
the
cecil
bloc
includ
ing
lord
midleton
lord
lansdowne
lord
selborne
lord
salisbury
and
others
support
for
the
bill
come
chiefly
from
lord
curzon
leader
in
the
upper
house
and
lord
islington
under
secretary
in
the
india
office
as
a
result
of
this
extensive
criticism
the
bill
be
revise
considerably
in
the
joint
committee
but
emerge
with
its
main
outline
unchanged
and
become
law
in
december
these
main
outline
especially
the
two
principle
of
dyarchy
and
responsibility
be
as
we
have
say
highly
charge
with
curtis
own
connotation
these
become
fainter
as
time
pass
both
because
of
development
in
india
and
because
curtis
from
on
become
increasingly
remote
from
indian
affair
the
refusal
of
the
indian
national
congress
under
gandhi
leadership
to
cooperate
in
carry
on
the
government
under
the
act
of
persuade
the
other
member
of
the
group
and
perhaps
curtis
himself
that
it
be
not
possible
to
apply
responsible
government
on
the
british
model
to
india
this
point
o
view
which
have
be
state
so
emphatically
by
member
of
the
cecil
bloc
even
before
and
which
form
the
chief
argument
against
the
act
o
in
the
debate
in
the
house
of
lord
be
accepted
by
the
milner
group
as
their
own
after
halifax
grigg
amery
coupland
fisher
and
others
state
this
most
emphatically
from
the
early
s
to
the
middle
s
in
grigg
state
this
as
a
principle
in
his
book
the
british
commonwealth
and
quote
with
approval
amery
statement
of
march
to
the
house
of
common
reject
the
british
parliamentary
system
as
suitable
for
india
amery
at
that
time
secretary
of
state
for
india
have
say
like
wasp
buzzing
angrily
up
and
down
against
a
window
pane
when
an
adjoin
window
may
be
wide
open
we
be
all
held
up
frustrate
and
irritated
by
the
unrealized
and
unsuperable
barrier
of
our
constitutional
prepossession
grigg
go
even
far
indeed
so
far
that
we
might
suspect
that
he
be
deprecate
the
use
of
parliamentary
government
in
general
rather
than
merely
in
india
he
say
it
be
entirely
devoid
of
flexibility
and
quite
incapable
of
engender
the
essential
spirit
of
compromise
in
country
where
racial
and
communal
division
present
the
principal
political
difficulty
the
idea
that
freedom
to
be
genuine
must
be
accommodate
to
this
pattern
be
deeply
root
in
us
and
we
must
not
allow
our
statesmanship
to
be
imprison
behind
the
bar
of
our
own
experience
our
insistence
in
particular
on
the
principle
of
a
common
roll
of
elector
voting
as
one
homogeneous
electorate
have
cause
reaction
in
south
africa
rebellion
or
something
much
too
like
it
in
kenya
and
deadlock
in
india
because
in
the
different
condition
of
those
country
it
must
involve
the
complete
and
perpetual
dominance
o
a
single
race
or
creed
unfortunately
as
reginald
coupland
have
point
out
in
his
book
india
a
re
statement
all
agree
that
the
british
system
of
government
be
unsuited
to
india
but
none
make
any
effort
to
find
an
indigenous
system
that
would
be
suitable
the
result
be
that
the
milner
group
and
their
associate
relaxed
in
their
effort
to
prepare
indian
to
live
under
a
parliamentary
system
and
finally
cut
india
loose
without
an
indigenous
system
and
only
partially
prepared
to
manage
a
parliamentary
system
this
decline
in
enthusiasm
for
a
parliamentary
system
in
india
be
well
under
way
by
in
the
two

from

the
most

british
factor
in

curtis
be

the

the

not

either
the

for
various
reason
of

this

to

the
most
important

the

and
between

and
the

broke
down
at
the
most
crucial
moment
the

through

participate
in

in

by
praise

relationship
between
birkenhead
and
the
milner
and
cecil
group
have
not
be
cordial
for
a
long
time
and
there
be
various
indication
of
feud
from
at
least
we
may
recall
that
in
april
a
secret
or
at
least
unofficial
committee
of
milner
group
and
cecil

member
have
nominate
lord
milner
for
the
post
of
chancellor
o
oxford
university
lord
birkenhead
have
object
both
to
the
candidate
and
to
the
procedure
in
regard
to
the
candidate
he
would
have
prefer
asquith
in
regard
to
the
procedure
he
demand
to
know
by
what
authority
this
committee
take
upon
itself
the
task
of
name
a
chancellor
to
a
university
o
which
he
lord
birkenhead
have
be
high
steward
since
this
protest
as
usual
when
englishman
of
this
social
level
be
deeply
move
take
the
form
of
a
letter
to
the
time
it
receive
a
tart
answer
in
a
letter
write
in
the
third
person
in
which
he
be
inform
that
this
committee
have
exist
before
the
world
war
and
that
when
it
be
reconstitute
at
the
end
of
the
war
mr
f
e
smith
have
be
invite
to
be
a
member
of
it
but
have
not
see
fit
even
to
acknowledge
the
invitation
the
bad
relationship
between
the
milner
group
and
lord
birkenhead
be
not
the
result
of
such
episode
as
this
but
rather
it
would
seem
base
on
a
personal
antipathy
engender
by
the
character
of
lord
birkenhead
and
especially
by
his
indiscreet
and
undiplomatic
social
life
and
political
activity
nonetheless
lord
birkenhead
be
a
man
of
unquestioned
vigor
and
ability
and
a
man
of
considerable
political
influence
from
the
day
in
when
he
have
won
a
parliamentary
seat
for
the
conservative
in
the
face
of
a
great
liberal
tidal
wave
as
a
result
he
have
obtain
the
post
of
secretary
of
state
for
india
in
november
at
the
same
time
that
leopold
amery
go
to
the
colonial
office
the
episode
regard
the
milner
candidacy
to
the
oxford
chancellorship
occur
six
month
later
and
be
practically
a
direct
challenge
from
birkenhead
to
amery
since
at
that
time
the
latter
be
milner
active
political
lieutenant
and
one
of
the
chief
mover
in
the
effort
to
make
him
chancellor
thus
in
the
period
the
milner
group
held
the
viceroy
post
but
do
not
hold
the
post
of
secretary
of
state
the
relationship
between
these
two
post
be
such
that
good
government
could
not
be
obtain
without
close
cooperation
between
them
such
cooperation
do
not
exist
in
this
period
as
far
as
the
constitutional
development
be
concerned
this
lack
of
cooperation
appear
in
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
secretary
of
state
to
continue
to
seek
a
solution
of
the
problem
along
the
road
marked
by
the
use
of
a
unilateral
british
investigatory
commission
and
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
irwin
and
the
milner
group
to
seek
a
solution
along
the
newer
road
of
cooperative
discussion
with
the
indian
these
tendency
do
not
appear
as
divergent
route
until
after
the
simon
commission
have
begin
its
labor
with
the
result
that
accumulate
evidence
that
the
latter
road
would
be
use
left
that
unilateral
commission
in
an
unenviable
position
the
government
of
india
act
of
have
provide
that
an
investigation
should
be
make
of
the
function
of
the
act
after
it
have
be
in
effect
for
ten
year
the
grow
unrest
of
the
indian
and
their
failure
to
utilize
the
opportunity
of
the
act
of
persuade
many
englishman
include
most
of
the
milner
group
that
the
promise
statutory
commission
should
begin
its
work
earlier
than
anticipate
and
should
direct
its
effort
rather
at
find
the
basis
for
a
new
constitutional
system
than
at
examine
the
obvious
failure
of
the
system
provide
in
i
the
first
official
hint
that
the
date
of
the
statutory
commission
would
be
move
up
be
give
by
birkenhead
on
march
in
combination
with
some
rather
arrogant
and
patronize
remark
about
indian
politics
the
time
while
criticize
birkenhead
for
his
additional
remark
take
up
the
suggestion
regard
the
commission
and
suggest
in
its
turn
that
the
ideal
body
would
consist
of
judicially

at

most
expensive

have
married
the
honourable
mary
wood
in
the
most
extraordinary
fact
about
the
simon
commission
be
the
lack
of
qualification
possess
by
its
member
except
for
the
undoubted
advantage
of
education
at
eton
and
oxford
the
member
have
no
obvious
claim
to
membership
on
any
committee
consider
indian
affair
indeed
not
one
o
the
eight
member
have
have
any
previous
contact
with
this
subject
nevertheless
the
commission
produce
an
enormous
two
volume
report
which
stand
as
a
monumental
source
book
for
the
study
of
indian
problem
in
this
period
when
to
the
lack
of
qualification
of
its
member
we
add
the
fact
that
the
commission
be
almost
completely
boycott
by
indian
and
obtain
its
chief
contact
with
the
native
by
listen
to
their
monotonous
chant
of
simon
go
back
it
seem
more
than
a
miracle
that
such
a
valuable
report
could
have
emerge
from
their
investigation
the
explanation
be
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
they
receive
full
cooperation
from
the
staff
of
the
government
of
india
include
member
of
the
milner
group
it
be
clear
that
by
the
end
of
the
milner
group
as
a
result
of
the
strong
indian
opposition
to
the
simon
commission
the
internal
struggle
within
that
commission
between
simon
and
burnham
because
of
the
latter
refusal
to
go
as
far
as
the
former
desire
in
the
direction
of
concession
to
the
indian
and
their
inability
to
obtain
cooperation
from
the
secretary
of
state
as
reveal
in
the
steady
criticism
of
birkenhead
in
the
time
have
decide
to
abandon
the
commission
method
of
procedure
in
favor
of
a
round
table
method
of
procedure
it
be
not
surprising
that
the
round
table
group
should
prefer
a
roundtable
method
of
procedure
even
in
regard
to
indian
affair
where
many
of
the
participant
would
have
relatively
little
experience
in
the
typical
british
procedure
of
agreement
through
conference
to
the
milner
group
the
round
table
method
be
not
only
preferable
in
itself
but
be
make
absolutely
necessary
by
the
widespread
indian
criticism
of
the
simon
commission
for
its
exclusively
british
personnel
this
restriction
have
be
adopt
originally
on
the
ground
that
only
a
purely
british
and
purely
parliamentary
commission
could
commit
parliament
in
some
degree
to
acceptance
of
the
recommendation
of
the
commission
at
least
this
be
the
defense
of
the
restrict
membership
make
to
the
indian
by
the
viceroy
on
november
in
place
of
this
argument
the
milner
group
now
advanced
a
somewhat
more
typical
idea
namely
that
only
indian
participation
on
a
direct
and
equal
basis
could
commit
indian
to
any
plan
for
the
future
o
india
by
customary
milner
group
reason
they
decide
that
the
responsibility
place
on
indian
by
make
them
participate
in
the
formulation
of
plan
would
moderate
the
extremism
of
their
demand
and
bind
them
to
participate
in
the
execution
of
these
plan
after
they
be
enact
into
law
this
basic
idea
that
if
you
have
faith
in
people
they
will
prove
worthy
of
that
faith
or
express
in
somewhat
more
concrete
term
that
if
you
give
dissatisfied
people
voluntarily
more
than
they
expect
and
above
all
before
they
really
expect
to
get
it
they
will
not
abuse
the
gift
but
will
be
sober
simultaneously
by
the
weight
of
responsibility
and
the
sweetness
of
gratitude
be
an
underlie
assumption
o
the
milner
group
s
activity
from
to
the
present
its
validity
be
defend
when
proof
be
demand
by
a
historical
example
that
be
by
contrast
the
lack
of
generosity
in
britain
treatment
of
the
american
colony
in
with
the
generosity
in
her
treatment
of
the
canadian
colony
in
the
contrast
between
the
intolerable
act
and
the
durham
report
be
one
o
the
basic
idea
at
the
back
of
the
mind
o
all
the
important
member
o
the
milner
group
in
many
of
those
mind
however
this
assumption
be
not
base
on
political
history
at
all
but
have
a
more
profound
and
largely
unconscious
basis
in
the
teaching
of
christ
and
the
sermon
on
the
mount
this
be
especially
true
of
lionel
curtis
john
dove
lord
lothian
and
lord
halifax
unless
this
idea
be
recognize
it
be
not
possible
to
see
the
underlie
unity
behind
the
action
of
the
group
toward
the
boer
in
toward
india
in
and
and
toward
hitler
in
these
idea
as
a
justification
of
concession
to
india
be
to
be
found
in
milner
group
discussion
of
the
indian
problem
at
all
period
especially
just
before
the
act
of
a
decade
later
they
be
still
exert
their
influence
they
will
be
found
for
example
in
the
round
table
article
on
india
in
september
and
march
the
earlier
advocate
the
use
of
the
round
table
method
but
warn
that
it
must
be
base
on
complete
equality
for
the
indian
member
it
continued
indian
should
share
equally
with
great
britain
the
responsibility
for
reach
or
fail
to
reach
an
agreement
as
to
what
the
next
step
in
indian
constitutional
development
should
be
it
be
no
longer
a
question
as
we
see
it
of
great
britain
listen
to
indian
representative
and
then
decide
for
herself
what
the
next
indian
constitution
should
be
the
core
of
the
round
table
idea
be
that
representative
briton
and
representative
indian
should
endeavour
to
reach
an
agreement
on
the
understand
that
if
they
can
reach
an
agreement
each
will
loyally
carry
it
through
to
completion
as
be
the
case
with
ireland
in
as
see
by
the
milner
group
britain
s
responsibility
be
her
obligation
to
help
indian
to
take
maximum
responsibility
for
india
government
on
their
own
shoulder
and
to
insist
on
their
do
so
not
only
because
it
be
the
right
thing
in
itself
but
because
it
be
the
most
certain
antidote
to
the
real
danger
of
anarchy
which
threatens
india
unless
indian
do
learn
to
carry
responsibility
for
government
at
a
very
early
date
there
be
less
risk
in
go
too
fast
in
agreement
and
cooperation
with
political
india
than
in
go
at
a
more
moderate
pace
without
its
agreement
and
cooperation
indeed
in
our
view
the
most
successful
foundation
for
the
round
table
conference
would
be
that
great
britain
should
ask
the
indian
delegate
to
table
agree
proposal
and
then
do
her
utmost
to
accept
them
and
place
on
indian
shoulder
the
responsibility
for
carry
them
into
effect
it
be
very
doubtful
if
the
milner
group
could
have
substitute
the
round
table
method
for
the
commission
method
in
quite
so
abrupt
a
fashion
as
it
do
have
not
a
labour
government
come
to
office
early
in
as
a
result
the
difficult
lord
birkenhead
be
replace
as
secretary
of
state
by
the
much
more
cooperative
mr
wedgewood
benn
viscount
stansgate
since
the
great
degree
o
cooperation
which
the
milner
group
receive
from
benn
than
from
birkenhead
may
be
explain
by
the
fact
that
their
hope
for
india
be
not
far
distant
from
those
held
in
certain
circle
o
the
labour
party
it
may
also
be
explain
by
the
fact
that
wedgewood
benn
be
considerably
closer
in
a
social
sense
to
the
milner
group
than
be
birkenhead
benn
have
be
a
liberal
m
p
from
to
his
brother
sir
ernest
benn
the
publisher
have
be
close
to
the
milner
group
in
the
ministry
of
munition
in
and
in
the
ministry
of
reconstruction
in
and
his
nephew
john
old
son
of
sir
ernest
married
the
old
daughter
of
maurice
hankey
in
whatever
the
cause
or
combination
of
cause
lord
irwins
suggestion
that
the
round
table
method
be
adopt
be
accepted
by
the
labour
government
the
suggestion
be
make
when
the
viceroy
return
to
london
in
june
month
before
the
simon
report
be
draft
and
a
year
before
it
be
publish
with
this
suggestion
lord
irwin
combine
another
that
the
government
formally
announce
that
its
goal
for
india
be
dominion
status
the
plan
leak
out
probably
because
the
labour
government
have
to
consult
with
the
liberal
party
on
which
its
majority
depend
the
liberal
lord
reading
and
lloyd
george
advise
against
the
announcement
but
irwin
be
instruct
to
make
it
on
his
return
to
india
in
october
lord
birkenhead
heard
of
the
plan
and
write
a
vigorous
letter
o
protest
to
the
time
when
geoffrey
dawson
refuse
to
publish
it
it
appear
in
the
daily
telegraph
thus
repeat
the
experience
of
lord
lansdowne
even
more
famous
letter
of
lord
irwins
announcement
of
the
round
table
conference
and
of
the
goal
of
dominion
status
make
in
india
on
october
brought
a
storm
of
protest
in
england
it
be
reject
by
lord
reading
and
lloyd
george
for
the
liberal
and
by
lord
birkenhead
and
stanley
baldwin
for
the
conservative
it
be
highly
unlikely
that
the
milner
group
be
much
disturbed
by
this
storm
the
reason
be
that
the
member
of
the
group
have
already
decide
that
dominion
status
have
two
meaning
one
meaning
for
englishman
and
a
second
rather
different
meaning
for
indian
as
lord
irwin
write
in
a
private
memorandum
in
november
to
the
english
conception
dominion
status
now
connotes
as
indeed
the
word
itself
implies
an
achieve
constitutional
position
of
complete
freedom
and
immunity
from
interference
by
his
majesty
government
in
london
the
indian
seem
generally
to
mean
something
different
the
underlie
element
in
much
of
indian
political
thought
seem
to
have
be
the
d
ire
that
by
free
conference
between
great
britain
and
india
a
constitution
should
be
fashion
which
may
contain
within
itself
the
seed
of
full
dominion
status
grow
naturally
to
its
full
development
in
accordance
with
the
particular
circumstance
of
india
without
the
necessity
the
implication
of
which
the
indian
mind
resents
of
far
periodic
enquiry
by
way
of
commission
what
be
to
the
englishman
an
accomplish
process
be
to
the
indian
rather
a
declaration
of
right
from
which
future
and
complete
enjoyment
of
dominion
privilege
will
spring
this
distinction
without
any
reference
to
lord
irwin
whose
memorandum
be
not
publish
until
be
also
make
in
the
september
issue
of
the
round
table
on
this
basis
for
the
sake
of
appeasement
of
india
the
milner
group
be
willing
to
promise
india
dominion
status
in
the
indian
meaning
o
the
expression
and
allow
the
english
who
misunderstood
to
cool
off
gradually
as
they
saw
that
the
development
be
not
the
one
they
have
fear
indeed
to
the
milner
group
it
probably
appear
that
the
great
the
rage
in
britain
the
great
the
appeasement
in
india
accordingly
the
first
session
of
the
round
table
conference
be
call
for
november
it
marked
an
innovation
not
only
because
of
the
status
of
equality
and
responsibility
which
it
place
on
the
indian
but
also
because
for
the
first
time
it
try
to
settle
the
problem
of
the
indian
state
within
the
same
framework
as
it
settle
the
constitutional
problem
of
british
india
this
be
a
revolutionary
effort
and
its
degree
of
success
be
very
largely
due
to
the
preparatory
work
o
lord
irwin
act
on
the
advice
of
malcolm
hailey
the
indian
state
have
remain
as
backward
feudalistic
and
absolutist
enclave
within
the
territorial
extent
of
british
india
and
bound
to
the
british
raj
by
individual
treaty
and
agreement
as
might
be
expect
from
the
milner
group
the
solution
which
they
propose
be
federation
they
hop
that
devolution
in
british
india
would
secure
a
degree
of
provincial
autonomy
that
would
make
it
possible
to
bind
the
province
and
the
indian
state
within
the
same
federal
structure
and
with
similar
local
autonomy
however
the
group
knew
that
the
indian
state
could
not
easily
be
federate
with
british
india
until
their
system
of
government
be
raise
to
some
approximation
o
the
same
level
for
this
reason
and
to
win
the
prince
over
to
federation
lord
irwin
have
a
large
number
of
personal
consultation
with
the
prince
in
and
at
some
of
these
he
lecture
the
prince
on
the
principle
o
good
government
in
a
fashion
which
come
straight
from
the
basic
ideology
of
the
milner
group
the
memorandum
which
he
present
to
them
date
june
and
publish
in
johnson
biography
viscount
halifax
could
have
be
write
by
the
kindergarten
this
can
be
see
in
its
definition
of
the
function
of
government
its
emphasis
on
the
reign
of
law
its
advocacy
of
devolution
its
homily
on
the
duty
of
prince
its
separation
o
responsibility
in
government
from
democracy
in
government
and
its
treatment
of
democracy
as
an
accidental
rather
than
an
essential
characteristic
of
good
government
the
value
of
this
preparatory
work
appear
at
the
first
round
table
conference
where
contrary
to
all
expectation
the
indian
prince
accepted
federation
the
optimism
result
from
this
agreement
be
to
a
considerable
degree
dissipate
however
by
the
refusal
of
gandhi
party
to
participate
in
the
conference
unless
india
be
grant
full
and
immediate
dominion
status
refusal
of
these
term
result
in
an
outburst
of
political
activity
which
make
it
necessary
for
irwin
to
find
jail
capable
of
hold
sixty
thousand
indian
agitator
at
one
time
the
view
that
the
round
table
conference
represent
a
complete
repudiation
of
the
simon
commission
approach
to
the
indian
problem
be
assiduously
propagate
by
the
milner
group
in
order
to
prevent
indian
animosity
against
the
latter
from
be
carry
over
against
the
former
but
the
difference
be
in
detail
since
in
main
outline
both
reflect
the
group
faith
in
federation
devolution
responsibility
and
minority
right
the
chief
recommendation
of
the
simon
commission
be
three
in
number
to
create
a
federation
of
british
india
and
the
indian
state
by
use
the
province
of
the
former
as
federative
unit
with
the
latter
to
modify
the
central
government
by
make
the
legislative
assembly
a
federal
organization
but
otherwise
leave
the
center
unchanged
to
end
dyarchy
in
the
province
by
make
indian
responsible
for
all
provincial
activity
it
also
advocate
separation
of
burma
from
india
these
be
also
the
chief
conclusion
of
the
various

of
the
government

arouse
a
good

comment
lord

in
the

of

criticize
this
especially
the
fashion
in
which
hoare
use
his
position
to
push
his
point
of
view
and
to
influence
the
evidence
which
the
committee
receive
from
other
witness
he
conclude
this
committee
be
not
a
judicial
body
and
its
conclusion
be
vitiate
thereby
you
may
say
that
on
their
merit
they
have
produce
a
good
or
a
bad
report
but
what
you
cannot
say
be
that
the
report
be
the
judicial
find
of
unbiased
or
impartial
mind
as
a
result
of
such
complaint
the
house
of
common
committee
on
privilege
investigate
the
conduct
of
the
joint
select
committee
it
found
that
hoare
action
toward
witness
and
in
regard
to
documentary
evidence
could
be
brought
within
the
scope
of
the
stand
order
of
the
house
if
a
distinction
be
make
between
judicial
committee
and
nonjudicial
committee
and
between
witness
give
fact
and
give
opinion
these
distinction
make
it
possible
to
acquit
sir
samuel
of
any
violation
of
privilege
but
arouse
such
criticism
that
a
select
committee
on
witness
be
form
to
examine
the
rule
for
deal
with
witness
in
its
report
on
june
this
select
committee
reject
the
validity
of
the
distinction
between
judicial
and
nonjudicial
and
between
fact
and
opinion
make
by
the
committee
on

and
recommend
that
the
stand
rule
be
amend
to
forbid
any
tamper
with
document
that
have
be
receive
by
a
committee
the
final
result
be
a
formal
acquittal
but
a
moral
condemnation
of
hoare
action
in
regard
to
the
joint
select
committee
on
the
government
of
india
the

on

in
a

shout
at
us
the
warn
that

consciousness

be
arouse
be
apt
to
be
a
source
of
great
weakness
and
not
impossibly
great
danger
we
have
not
learn
that
lesson
let
me
remind
the
house
in
the
eighteenth
century
and
we
paid
very
dearly
for
it
we
learn
it
some
sixty
year
later
and
by
have
learn
it
we
transform
the

and
history
of

lord
salisbury
once
again
advise
delay
and
attack
the
idea
that
parliamentary
government
could
work
in
india
or
indeed
have
work
anywhere
outside
the
british
commonwealth
lord
snell
speak
for
the
labour
opposition
object
to
the
lack
of
protection
against
economic
exploitation
for
the
indian
mass
the
omission
of
any
promise
of
dominion
status
for
india
the
weigh
of
the
franchise
too
heavily
on

o
the

and
too
lightly
on
the
side
of

of

for
a

and
the

lord

answer
both
speaker
support
only
one
criticism
that
against
indirect
election
to
the
central
assembly
he
make
the
significant
statement
that
he
do
not
fear
to
turn
india
over
to
the
congress
party
of
gandhi
because
though
i
disagree
with
almost
everything
that
they
say
in
public
and
most
of
their
political
programme
i
have
a
sneak
sympathy
with
the
emotion
which
lie
underneath
them
the
aspiration
of
young
impetuous
india
anxious
to
take
responsibility
on
its
own
shoulder
and
because
i
believe
that
the
one
political
lesson
which
have
more
often
be
realize
in
the
british
commonwealth
of
nation
than
anywhere
else
in
the
world
be
that
the
one
corrective
of
political
extremism
be
to
put
responsibility
upon
the
extremist
and
by
these
proposal
that
be
exactly
what
we
be
do
these
be
typical
milner
group
reason
in
the
debate
halifax
be
support
by

while
the

westminster
carnock
islington
and

it
be
clear
that
the

vote
completely
with
the

while
the

split
the

o

on

by
sir

be
to

expect
his
argument

base
on
the
lesson
to

derive
from
the
error
of
and
the
success
of
in
north

the

on
plain
good
intention

sir
herbert
samuel

by
sir

and
then
subject
to
a
long
sustain
barrage
from
winston
churchill
churchill
have
already
reveal
his
opinion
o
the
bill
over
the
bbc
when
he
say
on
january
that
it
be
a
monstrous
monument
o
sham
built
by
the
pygmy
he
continued
his
attack
in
a
similar
vein
with
the
result
that
almost
every
government
speaker
felt
the
need
to
caution
him
that
his
intemperance
be
hurt
his
own
cause
from
our
point
of
view
his
most
interest
statement
and
one
which
be
not
contradict
say
i
have
watch
this
story
from
its
very
unfold
and
what
have
struck
me
more
than
anything
else
about
it
have
be
the
amazingly
small
number
of
people
who
have
manage
to
carry
matter
to
their
present
lamentable
pitch
you
could
almost
count
them
on
the
finger
of
one
hand
i
have
also
be
struck
by
the
prodigious
power
which
this
group
of
individual
have
be
able
to
exert
and
relay
to
use
a
mechanical
term
through
the
vast
machinery
of
party
of
parliament
and
of
patronage
both
here
and
in
the
east
it
be
tragical
that
they
should
have
be
able
to
mislead
the
loyalty
and
use
the
asset
of
the
empire
to
s
own
undo
i
compliment
them
on
their
skill
and
i
compliment
them
also
on
their
disciple
their
chorus
be
exceedingly
well
drill
this
statement
be
answer
by
lord
eustace
percy
who
quote
lord
hugh
cecil
on
profitable
mendacity
this
lead
to
an
argument
in
which
both
side
appeal
to
the
speaker
order
be
restore
when
lord
eustace
say
of
churchill
i
would
never
impute
to
him
any
intention
of
make
a
charge
which
he
do
not
believe
himself
it
be
quite
clear
that
churchill
believe
his
charge
and
be
refer
to
what
we
have
call
the
milner
group
although
he
would
not
have
know
it
under
that
name
nor
would
he
have
realize
its
extreme
ramification
he

the

remove
the

the

of

into
two
dominion
within
the
british
commonwealth
be
control
by
new
hand
but
the
previous
action
of
the
milner
group
have
so
commit
the
situation
that
these
new
hand
have
no
possibility
nor
indeed
desire
to
turn
the
indian
problem
into
new
path
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
with
the
milner
group
still
in
control
the
event
of
in
respect
to
india
would
have
differ
only
in
detail
the
history
of
british
relation
with
india
in
the
twentieth
century
be
disastrous
in
this
history
the
milner
group
played
a
major
role
to
be
sure
the
material
with
which
they
have
to
work
be
intractable
and
they
have
inconvenient
obstacle
at
home
like
the
diehard
within
the
conservative
party
but
these
problem
be
make
bad
by
the
misconception
about
india
and
about
human
being
held
by
the
milner
group
the
base
on
which
they
built
their
policy
be
fine
indeed
too
fine
these
base
be
idealistic
almost
utopian
to
a
degree
which
make
it
impossible
for
them
to
grow
and
function
and
make
it
highly
likely
that
force
o
ignorance
and
barbarism
would
be
release
with
result
exactly
contrary
to
the
desire
of
the
milner
group
on
the
basis
o
love
of
liberty
human
right
minority
guarantee
and
self
responsibility
the
milner
group
take
action
that
broke
down
the
line
of
external
authority
in
indian
society
faster
than
any
line
of
internal
self
discipline
be
be
create
it
be
say
that
the
road
to
perdition
be
pave
with
good
intention
the
road
to
the
indian
tragedy
of
be
also
pave
with
good
intention
and
those
pave
block
be
manufacture
and
laid
down
by
the
milner
group
the
same
good
intention
contribute
largely
to
the
dissolution
o
the
british
empire
the
race
war
of
south
africa
and
the
unleash
of
the
horror
of
on
the
world
to
be
sure
in
india
as
elsewhere
the
milner
group
ran
into
bad
luck
for
which
they
be
not
responsible
the
chief
case
o
this
in
india
be
the
amritsar
massacre
of
which
be
probably
the
chief
reason
for
gandhi
refusal
to
cooperate
in
carry
out
the
constitutional
reform
of
that
same
year
but
the
milner
group
policy
be
self
inconsistent
and
be
unrealistic
for
example
they
continually
insist
that
the
parliamentary
system
be
not
fit
to
indian
condition
yet
they
make
no
real
effort
to
find
a
more
adaptive
political
system
and
every
time
they
give
india
a
far
dose
o
selfgovernment
it
be
always
another
dose
of
the
parliamentary
system
but
cling
to
their
belief
they
load
down
this
system
with
special
device
which
hamper
it
from
function
as
a
parliamentary
system
should
the
irony
of
this
whole
procedure
rest
in
the
fact
that
the
minority
of
agitator
in
india
who
want
self
government
want
it
on
the
parliamentary
pattern
and
regard
every
special
device
and
every
statement
from
britain
that
it
be
not
adapt
to
indian
condition
as
an
indication
of
the
insincerity
in
the
british
desire
to
grant
self
government
to
india
a
second
error
arises
from
the
milner
group
s
lack
of
enthusiasm
for
democracy
democracy
as
a
form
of
government
involves
two
part
majority
rule
and
minority
right
because
of
the
group
lack
of
faith
in
democracy
they
held
no
brief
for
the
first
of
these
but
devote
all
their
effort
toward
achieve
the
second
the
result
be
to
make
the
minority
uncompromising
at
the
same
time
that
they
diminish
the
majority
faith
in
their
own
sincerity
in
india
the
result
be
to
make
the
moslem
league
almost
completely
obstructionist
and
make
the
congress
party
almost
completely
suspicious
the
whole
policy
encourage
extremist
and
discourage
moderate
this
appear
at
its
bad
in
the
system
of
communal
representation
and
communal
electorate
establish
in
india
by
britain
the
milner
group
knew
these
be
bad
but
felt
that
they
be
a
practical
necessity
in
order
to
preserve
minority
right
in
this
they
be
not
only
wrong
as
prove
by
history
but
be
sacrifice
principle
to
expediency
in
a
way
that
can
never
be
permit
by
a
group
whose
action
claim
to
be
so
largely
dictate
by
principle
to
do
this
weakens
the
faith
of
others
in
the
group
principle
the
group
make
another
error
in
their
constant
tendency
to
accept
the
outcry
of
a
small
minority
of
europeanize
agitator
as
the
voice
of
india
the
mass
of
the
indian
people
be
probably
in
favor
of
british
rule
for
very
practical
reason
the
british
give
these
mass
good
government
through
the
indian
civil
service
and
other
service
but
they
make
little
effort
to
reach
them
on
any
human
intellectual
or
ideological
level
the
color
line
be
drawn
not
between
british
and
indian
but
between
british
and
the
mass
for
the
educate
upperclass
indian
be
treat
as
equal
in
the
majority
of
case
the
existence
of
the
color
line
do
not
bother
the
mass
of
the
people
but
when
it
hit
one
of
the
educate
minority
he
forgot
the
more
numerous
group
of
case
where
it
have
not
be
apply
to
him
become
antibritish
and
begin
to
flood
the
uneducated
mass
with
a
deluge
o
antibritish
propaganda
this
could
have
be
avoid
to
a
great
extent
by
training
the
british
civil
servant
to
practice
racial
toleration
toward
all
class
by
increase
the
proportion
of
financial
expenditure
on
elementary
education
while
reduce
that
on
high
education
by
use
the
increase
literacy
of
the
mass
of
the
people
to
impress
on
them
the
good
they
derive
from
british
rule
and
to
remove
those
grosser
superstition
and
social
custom
which
justified
the
color
line
to
so
many
english
all
of
these
except
the
last
be
in
accordance
with
milner
group
idea
the
member
of
the
group
object
to
the
personal
intolerance
of
the
british
in
india
and
regret
the
disproportionate
share
of
educational
expenditure
which
go
to
high
education
see
the
speech
in
parliament
of
ormsby
gore
december
but
they
continued
to
educate
a
small
minority
most
of
whom
become
anti
british
agitator
and
left
the
mass
of
the
people
expose
to
the
agitation
of
that
minority
on
principle
the
group
would
not
interfere
with
the
superstition
and
grosser
social
custom
of
the
mass
of
the
people
on
the
ground
that
to
do
so
would
be
to
interfere
with
religious
freedom
yet
britain
have
abolish
suttee
child
marriage
and
thuggery
which
be
also
religious
in
foundation
if
the
british
could
have
reduce
cow
worship
and
especially
the
number
of
cow
to
moderate
proportion
they
would
have
confer
on
india
a
blessing
great
than
the
abolition
o
suttee
child
marriage
and
thuggery
together
would
have
remove
the
chief
source
of
animosity
between
hindu
and
moslem
and
would
have
raise
the
standard
of
living
of
the
indian
people
to
a
degree
that
would
have
more
than
paid
for
a
system
of
elementary
education
if
all
of
these
thing
have
be
do
the
agitation
for
independence
could
have
be
delayed
long
enough
to
build
up
an
electorate
capable
o
work
a
parliamentary
system
then
the
parliamentary
system
which
educate
indian
want
could
have
be
extend
to
them
without
the
undemocratic
device
and
animadversion
against
it
which
usually
accompany
any
effort
to
introduce
it
on
the
part
of
the
british
in
foreign
policy
any
effort
to
write
an
account
o
the
influence
exercise
by
the
milner
group
in
foreign
affair
in
the
period
between
the
two
world
war
would
require
a
complete
rewrite
of
the
history
of
that
period
this
cannot
be
do
within
the
limit
of
a
single
chapter
and
it
will
not
be
attempt
instead
an
effort
will
be
make
to
point
out
the
chief
idea
of
the
milner
group
in
this
field
the
chief
method
by
which
they
be
able
to
make
those
idea
prevail
and
a
few
significant
example
of
how
these
method
work
in
practice
the
political
power
of
the
milner
group
in
the
period
grow
quite
steadily
it
can
be
measure
by
the
number
of
ministerial
portfolio
held
by
member
of
the
group
in
the
first
period
they
generally
held
about
one
fifth
of
the
cabinet
post
for
example
the
cabinet
that
resign
in
january
have
nineteen
member
four
be
of
the
milner
group
only
one
from
the
inner
circle
these
four
be
leopold
amery
edward
wood
samuel
hoare
and
lord
robert
cecil
in

in
the

of
the

in
this

the
influence
of
the
milner

be
exercise
in
two
vitally
significant
political
act
in
the
first
case
the
milner
group
appear
to
have
played
an
important
role
behind
the
scene
in
persuade
the

ask

phase
say
that
balfour
amery

intervene
with
the

to
oppose

and
the
cumulative
effect
of
these

be
to
reverse
the

m
of

if
amery
do
intervene
he
undoubtedly
do
so
as
the

and
if
milner
oppose
curzon
to
this
extent
through

he
be

by
conservative

the
obvious
purpose
of
this

be
to
split
the

and
place
the
administration
back
in
conservative
hand
in
this
intrigue
the
milner

apparently
played
an
important
if
secret
role
that
they
be
in
a
position
to
play
such
a
role
be
clear
we
have
mention
the
pressure
which
the
banker
be
put
on
the
labour
government
in
the
period
the
milner
group
be
clearly
in
a
position
to
influence
this
pressure
e

we
have
already
indicate
the
ability
of
the
milner
group
to
influence
the
king
in
respect
to
the
choice
o
baldwin
as
prime

in
by
this
power
be
even
great
thus
the
milner
group
be
in
a
position
to
play
a
role
in
the
intrigue
o
that
they
may
have
do
so
be
to
be
found
in
the
fact
that
two
of
the
important
figure
in
this
intrigue
within
the

godfrey

malcolm
macdonald
son
and
intimate
associate
of

clearly
played
an
important
role
in
the

he
be
reward
with
a

in

cause
as
we
shall

by
the

question
of

in
the

at
the

somervell
lothian
hankey

and
amery
it
would
appear
that
the
milner
group
increase
its
influence
on
the
government
until
about
we
have
already
indicate
the
great
power
which
they
exercise
in
the
period
this
influence
while
great
be
neither
decisive
nor
preponderant
at
the
time
the
milner
group
be
share
influence
with
at
least
two
other
group
and
be
perhaps
the
least
powerful
of
the
three
it
surely
be
less
powerful
than
the
cecil
bloc
even
as
late
as
and
be
less
powerful
perhaps
than
the
rather
isolated
figure
of
lloyd
george
as
late
as
these
relative
degree
of
power
on
the
whole
do
not
amount
to
very
much
because
the
three
that
we
have
mention
generally
agree
on
policy
when
they
disagreed
the
view
of
the
milner
group
do
not
usually
prevail
there
be
two
reason
for
this
both
the
cecil
bloc
and
lloyd
george
be
susceptible
to
pressure
from
the
british
electorate
and
from
the
ally
of
britain
the
milner
group
as
a
nonelected
group
could
afford
to
be
disdainful
of
the
british
electorate
and
of
french
opinion
but
the
person
actually
responsible
for
the
government
like
lloyd
george
balfour
and
others
could
not
be
so
casual
as
a
consequence
the
milner
group
be
bitterly
disappointed
over
the
peace
treaty
with
germany
and
over
the
covenant
of
the
league
of
nation
this
may
seem
impossible
when
we
realize
how
much
the
group
contribute
to
both
of
these
for
they
do
contribute
a
great
deal
chiefly
because
of
the
fact
that
the
responsible
statesman
generally
accepted
the
opinion
of
the
expert
on
the
term
of
the
treaty
especially
the
territorial
term
there
be
only
one
case
where
the
delegate
overrule
a
committee
of
expert
that
be
unanimous
and
that
be
the
case
of
the
polish
corridor
where
the
expert
be
more
severe
with
germany
than
the
final
agreement
the
expert
thus
be
of
very
great
importance
and
among
the
expert
the
milner
group
have
an
important
place
as
we
have
see
it
would
thus
seem
that
the
milner
group
disappointment
with
the
peace
settlement
be
largely
criticism
of
their
own
handiwork
to
a
considerable
extent
this
be
true
the
explanation
lie
in
the
fact
that
much
of
what
they
do
as
expert
be
do
on
instruction
from
the
responsible
delegate
and
the
fact
that
the
group
ever
after
have
a
tendency
to
focus
their
eye
on
the
few
blemish
of
the
settlement
to
the
complete
neglect
of
the
much
large
body
of
acceptable
decision
except
for
this
the
group
could
have
no
justification
for
their
dissatisfaction
except
as
self
criticism
when
the
original
draft
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
be
present
to
the
german
on
may
the
defeat
delegate
be
aghast
at
its
severity
they
drew
up
a
detailed
criticism
of
page
the
answer
to
this
protest
make
a
few
minor
change
in
the
treaty
but
allow
the
major
provision
to
stand
be
draft
by
an
interallied
committee
of
five
of
which
philip
kerr
be
the
british
member
the
change
that
be
make
as
concession
to
the
german
be
make
under
pressure
from
lloyd
george
who
be
himself
under
pressure
from
the
milner
group
this
appear
clearly
from
the
minute
of
the
council
of
four
at
the
peace
conference
the
first

drive
to

he
have
be
consult
with
his
delegation
and
with
the
cabinet
he
specifically
mention
george
barnes
the
only
labour
representative
in
his
cabinet
the
south

be
also

the
present
treaty

view
carry
great
weight
austen
chamberlain
lord

and
both
the
archbishop
except
for
barnes
and
the
archbishop
all
o
these
be
close
to
the
milner
group
the
reference
to
h
a
l
fisher
be
especially
significant
for
fisher
s
view
could
carry
great
weight
only
insofar
as
he
be
a
member
of
the
milner
group
the
reference
to
the
south

prepared
to
sign
no
matter
what
he
felt
about

lloyd
george
objection
to
the
treaty
as
present
in
the
council
of
four
on
june
be
those
which
soon
become
the
trademark
of
the
milner
group
in
addition
to
criticism
of
the
territorial
clause
on
the
polish
frontier
and
a
demand
for
a
plebiscite
in
upper
silesia
the
chief
objection
be
aim
at
reparation
and
the
occupation
of
the
rhineland
on
the
former
point
lloyd
george
adviser
thought
that
more
have
be
ask
for
than
germany
could
pay
on
the
latter
point
which
be
the
main
british
concern
his
adviser
be
insistent
they
urge
that
when
the
german
army
be
reduce
to
a
strength
of
men
it
be
ridiculous
to
maintain
an
army
of
occupation
of
men
on
the
rhine
they
represent
that
it
be
only
a
method
of
quarter
the
french
army
on
germany
and
make
germany
pay
the
cost
it
have
be
point
out
that
germany
would
not
constitute
a
danger
to
france
for
year
or
even
year
certainly
not
in
year
the
advice
of
the
british
military
authority
be
that
two
year
be
the
utmost
limit
of
time
for
the
occupation
to
these
complaint
clemenceau
have
reply
that
in
england
the
view
seem
to
prevail
that
the
easy
way
to
finish
the
war
be
by
make
concession
in
france
the
contrary
view
be
held
that
it
be
best
to
act
firmly
the
french
people
unfortunately
knew
the
german
very
intimately
and
they
believe
that
the
more
concession
we
make
the
more
the
german
would
demand
he
recognize
that
germany
be
not
an
immediate
menace
to
france
but
germany
would
sign
the
treaty
with
every
intention
of
not
carry
it
out
evasion
would
be
make
first
on
one
point
and
then
on
another
the
whole
treaty
would
go
by
the
board
i
there
be
not
some
guarantee
such
as
be
provide
by
the
occupation
under
such
circumstance
as
these
it
seem
rather
graceless
for
the
milner
group
to
have
start
at
once
as
it
do
a
campaign
of
recrimination
against
the
treaty
philip
kerr
be
from
to
his
death
in
at
the
very
center
of
the
milner
group
his
violent
germanophobia
in
and
his
evident
familiarity
with
the
character
of
the
german
and
with
the
kind
of
treaty
which
they
would
have
impose
on
britain
have
the
role
be
reverse
should
have
make
the
treaty
of
versailles
very
acceptable
to
him
and
his
companion
or
if
not
unacceptable
on
ground
of
excessive
leniency
instead
kerr
brand
curtis
and
the
whole
inner
core
of
the
milner
group
begin
a
campaign
to
undermine
the
treaty
the
league
of
nation
and
the
whole
peace
settlement
those
who
be
familiar
with
the
activity
o
the
cliveden
set
in
the
s
have
generally
felt
that
the
appeasement
policy
associate
with
that
group
be
a
manifestation
of
the
period
after
only
this
be
quite
mistaken
the
milner
group
which
be
the
reality
behind
the
phantom
like
cliveden
set
begin
their
program

early
as
why
do
they
do
this
to
answer
this
question
we
must
fall
back
on
the
statement
of
the

general
impression
of
their
psychological

even
a
certain
amount
of
conjecture
the
best
statement
of
what
the
group
found
objectionable
in
the
peace

be
found
in
a
brilliant
book

more

in

to
the

in

on
close
personal
relationship
with
most
of
the
inner
core
of
the
milner
group
be
not
a
member
of
the
group
himself
but
his
psychology
in
be
similar
to
that
o
the
member
o
the
inner
core
in
general
the
member
of
this
inner
core
take
the
propagandist
slogan
of
as
a
truthful
picture
of
the
situation
i
have
in
dicated
how
the
group
have
work
out
a
theory
of
history
that
saw
the
whole
past
in
term
o
a
long
struggle
between
the
force
of
evil
and
the
force
of
righteousness
the
latter
they
define
at
various
time
as
the
rule
of
law
a
la
dicey
as
the
subordination
o
each
to
the
welfare
of
all
as
democracy
etc
they
accepted
wilson
identification
of
his
war
aim
with
his
war
slogan
a
world
safe
for
democracy
a
war
to
end
war
a
war
to
end
prussianism
selfdetermination
etc
as
meaning
what
they
meant
by
the
rule
of
law
they
accepted
his
fourteen
point
except
freedom
of
the
sea
as
implementation
of
these
aim
moreover
the
milner
group
and
apparently
wilson
make
an
assumption
which
have
a
valid
basis
but
which
could
be
very
dangerous
if
carry
out
carelessly
this
be
the
assumption
that
the
german
be
divide
into
two
group
prussian
autocrat
and
good
german
they
assume
that
if
the
former
group
be
remove
from
position
o
power
and
influence
and
magnanimous
concession
be
make
to
the
latter
germany
could
be
won
over
on
a
permanent
basis
from
asiatic
despotism
to
western
civilization
in
its
main
outline
the
thesis
be
valid
but
difficulty
be
numerous
in
the
first
place
it
be
not
possible
to
distinguish
between
good
german
and
bad
german
by
any
objective
criterion
the
distinction
certainly
could
not
be
base
on
who
be
in
public
office
in
in
fact
the
overwhelm
mass
of
german
almost
all
the
middle
class
except
a
few
intellectual
and
very
religious
person
a
considerable
portion
of
the
aristocratic
class
at

half
and
certain
segment
o
the
work
class
about
one
fifth

bad
german
in
the
sense
in
which
the
milner
group
use
that
expression
in
their
saner
moment
the
group
knew
this
in
december
curtis
write
in
the
round

on
this
subject
as
follow
no

the
creed
of

so
long
as
it
promise
them
the

o
the

they

the
small

that

remove
from

no

the

the

these

for
this
there
be
two
reason
one
for
which
brand
be
chiefly
responsible
be
base
on
certain
economic
assumption
among
these
the
chief
be
the
belief
that
disorder
and
social
unrest
could
be
avoid
only
if
prosperity
be
restore
to
germany
as
soon
as
possible
by
disorder
brand
meant
such
activity
as

in

bela

in

and
the
spartacists
or
kurt
eisner
in

to
brand
as
an
orthodox
international

prosperity
could
be
obtain
only
by
an
economic
system
under
the
control
of
the
old
establish
industrialist
and
banker
this
be
perfectly
clear
from
brand
article
in
the
round
table
reprint
in
his
book
war
and
national
finance
moreover
brand
feit
confident
that
the
old
economic
group
could
reestablish
prosperity
quickly
only
if
they
be
give
concession
in
respect
to
germany
international
financial
position
by
lighten
the
weight
of
reparation
on
germany
and
by
advance
credit
to
germany
chiefly
from
the
united
state
this
point
of
view
be
not
brand
s
alone
it
dominate
the
mind
of
all
international
banker
from
thomas
lamont
to
montague
norman
and
from
to
at
least
the
importance
of
brand
from
out
point
of
view
lie
in
the
fact
that
as
the
economic
experf
of
the
milner
group
and
one
of
the
leader
of
the

he
brought
this
point
of
view
into
the
group
and
be
able
to
direct
the
great
influence
of
the
group
in
this
direction
blindness
to
the
real
situation
in
germany
be
also
encourage
from
another
point
of

this
be
associate
with
philip

roughly
this
point
of
view
advocate
a
british
foreign
policy
base
on
the
old
balance
of
power
system
under
that
old
system
which
britain
have
follow
since
britain
should
support
the
second
strong
power
on
the
continent
against
the
strong
power
to
prevent
the
latter
from
obtain
supremacy
on
the
continent
for
one
brief
moment
in
the
group
toyed
with
the
idea
of
abandon
this
traditional
policy
for
one
brief
moment
they
felt
that
i
europe
be
give
self
determination
and
parliamentary

britain
could
permit
some
kind
of
federate

at
least
cooperative
europe
without
danger
to
britain
the
moment
soon
pass
the
league
of
nation
which
have
be
regard
by
the
group
as
the
seed
whence
a
united
europe
might
grow
become
nothing
more
than
a
propaganda
machine
as
soon
as
the
group
resume
its
belief
in
the
balance
of
power
curtis
who
in
december
write
in
the
round
table
that
the
balance
of
power
have
outlive
its
time
by
a
century
and
that
the
world
have
remain
a
prey
to
war
be
due
to
the
unnatural
alienation
of
the
british
and
american
commonwealth
curtis
who
write
this
in
four
year
later
january
vigorously
defend
the
idea
of
balance
of
power
against
the
criticism
of
professor
a
f
pollard
at
a
meeting
of
the
riia
this
change
in
point
of
view
be
base
on
several
factor
in
the
first
place
the
group
by
their
practical
experience
at
paris
in
found
that
it
be
not
possible
to
apply
either
self
determination
or
the
parliamentary
form
of
government
to
europe
as
a
result
of
this
experience
they
listen
with
more
respect
to
the
cecil
bloc
which
always
insist
that
these
especially
the
latter
be
intimately
associate
with
the
british
outlook
way
o
life
and
social
tradition
and
be
not
article
o
export
this
issue
be
always
the
chief
bone
of
contention
between
the
group
and
the
bloc
in
regard
to
india
in
india
where
their
own
influence
as
pedagogue
be
important
the
group
do
not
accept
the
bloc
argument
completely
but
in
europe
where
the
group
influence
be
remote
and
indirect
the
group
be
more
receptive
in
the
second
place
the
group
at
paris
become
alienate
from
the
french
because
of
the
latter
insistence
on
force
as
the
chief
basis
of
social
and
political
life
especially
the
french
insistence
on
a
permanent
mobilization
of
force
to
keep
germany
down
and
on
an
international
police
force
with
autonomous
power
as
a
part
of
the
league
of
nation
the
group
although
they
frequently
quote
admiral
mahan
kind
word
about
force
in
social
life
do
not
really
like
force
and
shrank
from
its
use
believe
as
might
be
expect
from
their
christian
background
that
force
could
not
avail
against
moral
issue
that
force
corrupts
those
who
use
it
and
that
the
real
basis
of
social
and
political
life
be
custom
and
tradition
at
paris
the
group
found
that
they
be
living
in
a
different
world
from
the
french
they
suddenly
saw
not
only
that
they
do
not
have
the
same
outlook
as
their
former
ally
but
that
these
ally
embrace
the
despotic
and
militaristic
outlook
against
which
the
late
war
have
be
wag
at
once
the
group
begin
to
think
that
the
influence
which
they
have
be
mobilize
against
prussian
despotism
since
could
best
be
mobilize
now
that
prussianism
be
dead
against
french
militarism
and
bolshevism
and
what
well
ally
against
these
two
enemy
in
the
west
and
the
east
than
the
newly
baptize
germany
thus
almost
without
realize
it
the
group
fell
back
into
the
old
balance
of
power
pattern
their
aim
become
the
double
one
of
keep
germany
in
the
fold
of
redeem
sinner
by
concession
and
of
use
this
revive
and
purify
germany
against
russia
and
france
in
the
third
place
the
group
in
have
be
willing
to
toy
with
the
idea
o
an
integrate
europe
because
in
they
believe
that
a
permanent
system
o
cooperation
between
britain
and
the
united
state
be
a
possible
outcome
of
the
war
this
be
the
lifelong
dream
of
rhodes
of
milner
o
lothian
of
curtis
for
that
they
would
have
sacrifice
anything
within
reason
when
it
become
clear
in
that
the
united
state
have
no
intention
of
underwriting
britain
and
instead
would
revert
to
her
prewar
isolationism
the
bitterness
of
disappointment
in
the
milner
group
be
beyond
bound
forever
after
they
blame
the
evil
of
europe
the
double
deal
o
british
policy
and
the
whole
train
of
error
from
to
on
the
american
reversion
to
isolationism
it
should
be
clearly
understood
that
by
american
reversion
to
isolationism
the
milner
group
do
not
mean
the
american
rejection
of
the
league
of
nation
frequently
they
say
that
they
do
mean
this
that
the
disaster
o
become
inevitable
when
the
senate
reject
the
league
of
nation
in
this
be
completely
untrue
both
as
a
statement
o
historical
fact
and
as
a
statement
of
the
group
attitude
toward
that
rejection
at
the
time
as
we
shall
see
in
a
moment
the
group
approve
of
the
senate
rejection
o
the
league
o
nation
because
the
reason
for
that
rejection
agree
completely
with
the
group
own
opinion
about
the
league
the
only
change
in
the
group
opinion
as
a
result
of
the
senate
rejection
of
the
league
occur
in
respect
to
the
group
opinion
regard
the
league
itself
previously
they
have
disliked
the
league
now
they
hat
it
except
as
a
propaganda
agency
the
proof
of
these
statement
will
appear
in
a
moment
the
change
in
the
group
attitude
toward
germany
begin
even
before
the
war
end
we
have
indicate
how
the
group
rally
to
give
a
public
testimonial
of
faith
in
lord
milner
in
october
when
he
become
the
target
of
public
criticism
because
of
what
be
regard
by
the
public
as
a
conciliatory
speech
toward
germany
the
group
object
violently
to
the
anti
german
tone
in
which
lloyd
george
conduct
his
electoral
campaign
in
the
khaki
election
of
december
the
round

in

spoke
of
lloyd

and
the
odious
character
o
his
election
campaign
zimmern
after
a
devastate
criticism
of
lloyd
george
conduct
in
the

write
he
err
not
like
the
english
people
out
of
ignorance
but
deliberately
out
of
cowardice
and
lack
of
faith
in
the
preface
to
the
same
volume
europe
in
convalescence
he
write
since
december
when
we
elect
a
parliament
pledge
to
violate
a
solemn
agreement
make
but
five
week
earlier
we
stand
sham
dishonour
and
above
all
distrust
before
mankind
the
agreement
to
which
zimmern
refer
be
the
so
call
pre
armistice
agreement
of
november
make
with
the
german
by
which
if
they
accepted
an
armistice
the
ally
agree
to
make
peace
on
the
basis
of
the
fourteen
point
it
be
the
thesis
of
the
milner
group
that
the
election
of
and
the
treaty
o
versailles
as
finally
sign
violate
this
prearmistice
agreement
as
a
result
the
group
at
once
embark
on
its
campaign
for
revision
of
the
treaty
a
campaign
whose
first
aim
apparently
be
to
create
a
guilty
conscience
in
regard
to
the
treaty
in
britain
and
the
united
state
zimmern
book
brand
s
book
of
the
previous
year
and
all
the
article
of
the
round
table
be
but
ammunition
in
this
campaign
however
zimmern
have
no
illusion
about
the
german
and
his
attack
on
the
treaty
be
base
solely
on
the
need
to
redeem
british
honor
as
soon
as
it
become
clear
to
him
that
the
group
be
go
beyond
this
motive
and
be
try
to
give
concession
to
the
german
without
any
attempt
to
purge
germany
of
its
vicious
element
and
without
any
guarantee
that
those
concession
would
not
be
use
against
everything
the
group
held
dear
he
left
the
inner
circle
of
the
group
and
move
to
the
second
circle
he
be
not
convince
that
germany
could
be
redeem
by
concession
make
blindly
to
germany
as
a
whole
or
that
germany
should
be
built
up
against
france
and
russia
he
make
his
position
clear
in
a
brilliant
and
courageous
speech
at
oxford
in
may
a
speech
in
which
he
denounce
the
steady
sabotage
of
the
league
of
nation
it
be
not
an
accident
that
the
most
intelligent
member
of
the
group
be
the
first
member
to
break
publicly
with
the
policy
o
appeasement
the
milner
group
thus
regard
the
treaty
of
versailles
as
too
severe
as
purely
temporary
and
as
subject
to
revision
almost
at
once
when
the
round
table
examine
the
treaty
in
its
issue
o
june
it
say
in
substance
the
punishment
of
germany
be
just
for
no
one
can
believe
in
any
sudden
change
of
heart
in
that
country
but
the
treaty
be
too
severe
the
spirit
of
the
pre
armistice
commitment
be
violate
and
in
detail
after
detail
germany
be
treat
unjustly
although
there
be
broad
justice
in
the
settlement
as
a
whole
specifically
the
reparation
be
too
severe
and
germany
neighbor
should
have
be
force
to
disarm
also
as
promise
in
wilson
fourth
point
no
demand
should
have
be
make
for
william
ii
as
a
war
criminal
if
he
be
a
menace
he
should
be
put
on
an
island
without
trial
like
napoleon
our
policy
must
be
magnanimous
for
our
war
be
with
the
german
government
not
with
the
german
people
even
earlier
in
december
the
round
table
say
it
would
seem
desirable
that
the
treaty
should
not
be
long
term
still
less
perpetual
instrument
perpetual
treaty
be
indeed
a
lien
upon
national
sovereignty
and
a
stand
contradiction
o
the
principle
of
the
democratic
control
of
foreign
policy
it
would
establish
a
salutory
precedent
if
the
network
of
treaty
sign
as
a
result
of
the
war
be
valid
for
a
period
of
ten
year
only
in
march
the
round
table
say
like
the
peace
conference
the
covenant
of
the
league
of
nation
aim
too
high
and
too
far
six
month
ago
we
look
to
it
to
furnish
the
mean
for
peaceful
revision
of
the
term
of
the
peace
where
revision
might
be
require
now
we
have
to
realize
that
national
sentiment
set
closer
limit
to
international
ac
tion
than
we
be
willing
then
to
recognize
the
same
article
then
go
on
to
speak
of
the
rejection
of
the
treaty
by
the
united
state
senate
it
defends
this
action
and
criticizes
wilson
severely
say
the
truth
of
the
matter
be
that
the
american
senate
have
express
the
real
sentiment
of
all
nation
with
hard
head
truthfulness
the
senate
have
put
into
word
what
have
already
be
demonstrate
in
europe
by
the
logic
of
event
namely
that
the
peace
o
versailles
attempt
too
much
and
the
covenant
which
guarantee
it
implies
a
capacity
for
united
action
between
the
ally
which
the
fact
do
not
warrant
the
whole
treaty
be
in
fact
frame
to
meet
the
same
impractical
desire
which
we
have
already
note
in
the
reparation
term
the
desire
to
mete
out
ideal
justice
and
to
build
an
ideal
world
nowhere
be
the
whole
point
of
view
of
the
milner
group
well
state
than
in
a
speech
of
general
smut
to
the
south
african
luncheon
club
in
london
october
after
violent
criticism
of
the
reparation
as
too
large
and
an
attack
on
the
french
effort
to
enforce
these
clause
he
call
for
a
meeting
of
principal
to
settle
the
problem
he
then
point
out
that
a
continuation
of
exist
method
would
lead
to
the
danger
of
german
disintegration
a
first
class
and
irreparable
disaster
it
would
mean
immediate
economic
chaos
and
it
would
open
up
the
possibility
o
future
political
danger
to
which
i
need
not
here
refer
germany
be
both
economically
and
politically
necessary

central
europe
he
advocate
apply
to
germany
the
benevolent
policy
which
this
country
adopt
toward
france
after
the
napoleonic
war
and
if
as
i
hope
she
will
do
germany
make
a
last
appeal
i
trust
this
great
empire
will
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
to
respond
to
that
appeal
and
to
use
all
its
diplomatic
power
and
influence
to
support
her
and
to
prevent
a
calamity
which
would
be
infinitely
more
dangerous
to
europe
and
the
world
than
be
the
downfall
of
russia
six
or
seven
year
ago

thus
line

up
in

continued
with
advice
against
apply
generosity
to
the
latter
country
on
the
question
of
french
war
debt
warn
that
this
would
only
encourage
french
militarism
do
not
let
us
from
mistaken
motif
of
generosity
lend
our
aid
to
the
far
militarization
of
the
european
continent
people
here
be
already
begin
to
be
seriously
alarmed
about
french
armament
on

and
in
the

in
addition
to
these
armament
the
french

also
lent
large
sum
to
the
small
european
state
around
germany
mainly
with
a
view
to
feed
their
ravenous
military
appetite
there
be

l
a
policy
o
excessive
generosity
on
our
part
or
on
the
part
of

may
simply
have
the
effect
of
enable
france
still
more
effectively
to
subsidize
and
foster
militarism
on
the
continent
if
thing
continue
on
the
present
line
this
country
may
soon
have
to
start
rearm
herself
in
sheer
self
defence
this
speech
of
smut
cover
so
adequately
the
point
of
view
of
the
milner
group
in
the
early
period
of
appeasement
that
no
far
quotation
be
necessary
no
real
change
occur
in
the
point
of
view
of
the
group
from
to
not
even
as
a
result
o
the
death
of
democratic
hope
in
germany
at
the
hand
of
the
nazi
from
smut
speech
of
october
before
the
south
african
luncheon
club
to
smut
speech
of
november
before
the
riia
much
water
flow
in
the
river
of
international
affair
but
the
idea
of
the
milner
group
remain
rigid
and
it
may
be
add
erroneous
just
as
the
speech
of
may
be
take
as
the
culmination
of
the
revisionist
sentiment
of
the
group
in
the
first
five
year
of
peace
so
the
speech
of
may
be
take
as
the
initiation
of
the
appeasement
sentiment
of
the
group
in
the
last
five
year
of
peace
the
speech
could
almost
be
interchange
we
may
call
one
revisionist
and
the
other
appease
but
the
point
of
view
the
purpose
the
method
be
the
same
these
speech
will
be
mention
again
later
the
aim
of
the
milner
group
through
the
period
from
to
be
the
same
to
maintain
the
balance
of
power
in
europe
by
building
up
germany
against
france
and
russia
to
increase
britain
weight
in
that
balance
by
align
with
her
the
dominion
and
the
united
state
to
refuse
any
commitment
especially
any
commitment
through
the
league
of
nation
and
above
all
any
commitment
to
aid
france
beyond
those
exist
in
to
keep
british
freedom
of
action
to
drive
germany
eastward
against
russia
if
either
or
both
of
these
two
power
become
a
threat
to
the
peace
of
western
europe
the
sabotage
of
the
peace
settlement
by
the
milner
group
can
be
see
best
in
respect
to
reparation
and
the
league
of
nation
in
regard
to
the
former
their
argument
appear
on
two
front
in
the
first
place
the
reparation
be
too
large
because
they
be
a
dishonorable
violation
of
the
pre
armistice
agreement
and
in
the
second
place
any
demand
for
immediate
or
heavy
payment
in
reparation
would
ruin
germany
international
credit
and
her
domestic
economic
system
to
the
jeopardy
o
all
reparation
payment
immediately
and
of
all
social
order
in
central
europe
in
the
long
run
the
argument
against
reparation
as
a
violation
of
the
pre
armistice
agreement
can
be
found
in
the
volume
of
zimmern
and
brand
already
mention
both
concentrate
their
objection
on
the
inclusion
of
pension
payment
by
the
victor
to
their
own
soldier
in
the
total
reparation
bill
give
to
the
german
this
be
of
course
an
obvious
violation
of

enough
it

the

may
perhaps
be

by

indeed
they
be
outrage
at
the
whole
policy
of

the
french
alliance
in

europe
the

these
six
thing
be
list
in

round
table
of
march
as
the
poincare
system
the
journal
then
continued
the
poincare
system
indeed
be
hopeless
it
lead
inevitably
to
fresh
war
for
it
be
incredible
that
a
powerful
and
spirit
people
like
the
german
will
be
content
to
remain
forever
meekly
obey
every
flourish

the
reader

inform
the

be
impracticable
it
assumes
that
the
interest
of
poland
and
the
little
entente
be
the
same
as
those
of
france
it
forgets
that
the
people
of
europe
cannot
balance
their
budget
and
recover
prosperity
unless
they
cut
down
their
expenditure
on
armament
to
a
minimum
it
ignores
the
certainty
that
british
opinion
can
no
more
tolerate
a
french
military
hegemony
over
europe
than
it
could
a
german
or
napoleonic
with
its
menace
to
freedom
and
democracy
everywhere
when
the
french
in
january
occupy
the
ruhr
in
an
effort
to
force
germany
to
pay
reparation
the
rage
of
the
milner
group
almost
broke
its
bound
in
private
and
in
the
anonymity
of
the
round
table
they
threaten
economic
and
diplomatic
retaliation
although
in
public
speech
such
as
in
parliament
they
be
more
cautious
however
even
in
public
fisher
simon
and
smut
permit
their
real
feeling
to
become
visible
in
the
march
issue
the
round
table
suggest
that
the
reparation
crisis
and
the
ruhr
stalemate
could
be
met
by
the
appointment
o
a

it
announce

inasmuch
as
the
future
peace
of

cannot
be
safeguard
nor
the
recovery
of
reparation
be
promote
by
the
operation
of
the
french
and
belgian
government
in
the
ruhr
it
be
urgently
necessary
to
seek
effective
security
against
aggression
by
international
guarantee
under
the
league
of
nation
and
to
invite
the
council
of
the
league
without
delay
to
appoint
a
commission
of
expert
to
report
upon
the
capacity
of
germany
to
pay
reparation
and
upon
the
best
method
of
effect
such
payment
and
that
in
view
o
the
recent
indication
o
willingness
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
state
of
america
to
participate
in
a
conference
to
this
end
the
british
representative
on
the
council
of
the
league
should
be
instruct
to
urge
that
an
invitation
be
extend
to
the
american
government
to
appoint
expert
to
serve
upon
the
commission
this
motion
have
of
course
no
chance
whatever
of
passing
and
fisher
have
no
expectation
that
it
would
it
be
merely
a
propaganda
device
two
statement
in
it
be
noteworthy
one
be
the
emphasis
on
american
participation
which
be
to
be
expect
from
the
milner
group
but
more
important
than
this
be
the
thinly
veil
threat
to
france
contain
in
the
word
it
be
urgently
necessary
to
seek
effective
security
against
aggression
by
international
guarantee
this
clause
refer
to
french
aggression
and
be
the
seed
from
which
emerge
three
year
later
the
locarno
pact
there
be
also
some
significant
phrase
or
slip
of
the
tongue
in
the
speech
which
fisher
make
in
sup
port
of
his
motion
for
example
he
use
the
word
we
in
a
way
that
apparently
refer
to
the
milner
group
and
he
spoke
of
liquidation
o
the
penal
clause
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
as
if
that
be
the
purpose
of
the
committee
he
be
seek
he
say
we
be
anxious
to
get
the
amount
of
the
reparation
payment
settle
by
an
impartial
tribunal
we
propose
that
it
should
be
remit
to
the
league
o
nation
but
i
admit
that
i
have
always
have
a
considerable
hesitation
in
ask
the
league
of
nation
to
undertake
the
liquidation
of
the
penal
clause
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
it
be
an
integral
part
of
this
amendment
that
the
american
should
be
brought
in
lord
robert
cecil
object
to
the
amendment
on
the
ground
that
its
passage
would
constitute
a
censure
o
the
government
and
force
it
to
resign
john
simon
then
spoke
in
support
of
the
motion
he
say
that
france
would
never
agree
to
any
reparation
figure
because
she
do
not
want
the
reparation
clause
fulfil
since
that
would
make
necessary
the
evacuation
of
the
rhineland
france
go
into
the
ruhr
he
say
not
to
collect
reparation
but
to
cripple
germany
france
be
spending
immense
sum
of
money
on
military
occupation
and
armament
but
still
be
fail
to
pay
either
the
principal
or
interest
on
her
debt
to
britain
when

the
sixth
of
that
month
fisher
say
in
the
house
of
common
i
can
only
suggest
this
that
the
government
make
it
clear
to
france
germany
and
the
whole
world
that
they
regard
this
present
issue
between
france
and
germany
not
as
an
issue
affect
two
nation
but
as
an
issue
affect
the
peace
and
prosperity
of
the
whole
world
we
should
keep
before
ourselves
steadily
the
idea
of
an
international
solution
we
should
work
for
it
with
all
our
power
and
we
should
make
it
clear
to
france
that
an
attempt
to
effect
a
separate
solution
of
this
question
could
not
be
consider
otherwise
than
as
an
unfriendly
act
exactly
a
week
later
john
simon
in
a
parliamentary
maneuver
make
a
motion
to
cut
the
appropriation
bill
for
the
foreign
office
by
and
seize
the
opportunity
to
make
a
violent
attack
on
the
action
of
france
he
be
answer
by
eustace
percy
who
in
turn
be
answer
by
fisher
in
this
way
the
group
try
to
keep
the
issue
before
the
mind
of
the
british
public
and
to
prepare
the
way
for
the
dawes
settlement
the
round
table
appeal
to
a
somewhat
different
public
kept
up
a
similar
barrage
in
the
june
issue
and
again
in
september
it
condemn
the
occupation
of
the
ruhr
in
the
former
it
suggest
a
three

as
follow
find
out
what
germany
can
pay
by
an
ex

from

another
hint
about
the
future
locarno

this
program
accord
to
the
round

should
be
impose
on
france
with
the
threat
that
if
france
do
not
accept
it
britain
would
withdraw
from
the
rhineland
and
reparation
commission
and
formally
terminate
the
entente
it
conclude
the
round
table
have
not
hesitate
in
recent
month
to
suggest
that
british
neutrality
be
an
attitude
inconsistent
either
with
the
honour
or
the
interest
of
the
british
commonwealth
the
round
table
even
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
inflation
in
germany
be
cause
by
the
burden
o
reparation
in
the
september
issue
it
say
probably
by
the
pen
of
brand
in
the
last
two
year
it
be
not
inflation
which
have
brought
down
the
mark
the
printing
press
have
be
engage
in
a
vain
attempt
to
follow
the
depreciation
of
the
currency
that
depreciation
have
be
a
direct
consequence
of
the
world
judgment
that
the
allied
claim
for
reparation
be
incapable
of
be
met
it
will
continue
until
that
judgment
or
in
other
word
those
claim
be
revise
in
october
smut
who
be
in
london
for
the
imperial
conference
and
be
in
close
contact
with
the
group
make
speech
in
which
he
compare
the
french
occupation
of
the
ruhr
with
the
german
attack
on
belgium
in
and
say
that
britain
may
soon
have
to
start
rearm
herself
in
sheer
self
defence
against
french
militarism
john
dove
write
to
brand
in
a
private
letter
found
an
additional
argument
against
france
in
the
fact
that
her
policy
be
injure
democracy
in
germany
he
write
it
seem
to
me
that
the
most
disastrous
effect
of
poincare
policy
would
be
the
final
collapse
of
democracy
in
germany
the
risk
of
which
have
be
point
out
in
the
round
table
the
irony
of
the
whole
situation
be
that
if
the
junker
should
capture
the
reich
again
the
same
old
antagonism
will
revive
and
we
shall
find
ourselves
willy
nilly
line
up
again
with
france
to
a
ert
a
danger
which
french
action
have
again
call
into
be
even
if
smut
follow
up
his
fine
speech
the
situation
may
have
change
so
much
before
the
imperial
conference
be
over
that
people
who
think
like
him
and
us
may
find
ourselves
baffle
i
doubt
if
we
shall
again
have
as
good
a
chance
of
get
a
peaceful
democracy
set
up
in
germany
after
the
dawes
plan
go
into
force
the
milner
group
policy
continued
to
be
follow
by
the
british
government
the
policy
of
fulfillment
pursue
by
germany
under
stresemann
be
close
to
the
heart
o
the
group
in
fact
there
be
a
certain
amount
of
evidence
that
the
group
be
in
a
position
to
reach
stresemann
and
advise
him
to
follow
this
policy
this
be
do
through
smut
and
lord
d
abernon
there
be
little
doubt
that
the
locarno
pact
be
design
in
the
milner
group
and
be
first
brought
into
public
notice
by
stresemann
at
the
suggestion
of
lord
d
abernon
immediately
after
smut
make
his
speech
against
france
in
october
he
get
in
touch
with
stresemann
presumably
in
connection
with
the
south
african
mandate
in
south
west
africa
smut
himself
told
the
story
to
mr
millen
his
authorize
biographer
in
these
word
i
be
in
touch
with
them
the
german
in
london
over
question
concern
german
south
west
they
have
sent
a
man
over
from
their
foreign
office
to
see
me
i
ca
not
say
the
german
have
behave
very
well
about
german
south
west
but
that
be
another
matter
well
naturally
my
speech
meant
something
to
this
fellow
the
english
be
hat
the
ruhr
business
it
be
turn
them
from
france
to
germany
the
whole
english
speak
world
be
hat
it
curzon
in
particular
be
hat
it
yet
very
little
be
be
do
to
express
all
this
feel
i
take
it
upon
myself
to
express
the
feel
i
act
you
understand
unofficially
i
consult
no
one
but
i
could
see
my
action
would
not
be
abhorrent
to
the
government
would
in
fact
be
a
relief
to
them
when
the
german
from
the
foreign
office
come
to
me
full
of
what
this
sort
of
attitude
would
mean
to
stresemann
i
told
him
i
be
speak
only
for
myself
but
you
can
see
i
say
that
the
people
here
approve
of
my
speech
if
my
personal
advice
be
any
use
to
you
i
would
recommend
the
german
to
give
up
their
policy
o
non
cooperation
to
rely
on
the
goodwill
of
the
world
and
make
a
sincere
advance
towards
the
well
understand
which
i
be
sure
can
be
brought
about
i
get
in
touch
with
stresemann
our
correspondence
follow
those
line
you
will
remember
that
stresemann
policy
end
in
the
dawes
plan
and
the
pact
of
locarno
and
that
he
get
the
nobel
peace
for
this
work
i
in
this
connection
it
be
worthy
of
note
that
the
german
chancellor
at
a
cabinet
meeting
on
november
quote
smut
by
name
as
the
author
of
what
he
stresemann
consider
the
proper
road
out
of
the
crisis
lord
d
abernon
be
not
a

however

year
be
devote
to

to

in
he
be
the
british
civilian
member
of
the
weygand
mission
to
warsaw
this
mission
undoubtedly
have
an
important
influence
on
his
think
as
a
chief
figure
in
salisbury
effort
to
bolster
up
the
ottoman
empire
against
russia
d
abernon
have
always
be
anti
russian
in
this
respect
his
background
be
like
curzon
as
a
result
of
the
warsaw
mission
d
abernons
anti
russian
feel
be
modify
to
an
anti
bolshevik
one
of
much
great
intensity
to
him
the
obvious
solution
seem
to
be
to
build
up
germany
as
a
military
bulwark
against
the
soviet
union
he
say
as
much
in
a
letter
of
august
to
sir
maurice
hankey
this
letter
print
by
d
abernon
in
his
book
on
the
battle
of
warsaw
the
eighteenth
decisive
battle
of
the
world
publish
suggests
that
a
good
bargain
might
be
make
with
the
german
military
leader
in
cooperate
against
the
soviet
shortly
afterwards
d
abernon
be
make
british
ambassador
at
berlin
at
the
time
it
be
widely
rumor
and
never
deny
that
he
have
be
appoint
primarily
to
obtain
some
settlement
o
the
reparation
problem
it
be
felt
that
his
wide
experience
in
international
public
finance
would
qualify
him
for
this
work
this
may
have
be
so
but
his
prejudice
likewise
qualify
him
for
only
one
solution
to
the
problem
the
one
desire
by
the
german
in
reach
this
solution
d
abernon
act
as
the
intermediary
among
stresemann
the
german
chancellor
curzon
the
foreign
secretary
and
apparently
kindersley
brand
associate
at
lazard
brother
accord
to
harold
nicolson
in
his
book
curzon
the
last
phase
uthe
initial
credit
for
what
prove
the
ultimate
solution
belongs
in
all
probability
to
lord
d
abernon
one
of
the
most
acute
and
broad
mind
diplomatist
which
this
country
have
ever
possess
in
the
event
lead
up
to
curzons
famous
note
to
france
o
august
the
note
which
contend
that
the
ruhr
occupation
could
not
be
justified
under
the
treaty
o
versailles
d
abernon
played
an
important
role
both
in
london
and
in
berlin
in
his
diary
of
an
ambassador
d
abernon
merely
list
the
note
between
curzon
and
france
and
add
throughout
this
controversy
lord
d
abernon
have
be
consult
during
his
term
as
ambassador
in
berlin
d
abernon
policy
be
identical
with
that
of
the
milner
group
except
for
the
shade
that
he
be
more
anti
soviet
and
less
anti
french
and
be
more
impetuous
in
his
desire
to
tear
up
the
treaty
of
versailles
in
favor
of
germany
this
last
distinction
rest
on
the
fact
that
d
abernon
be
ready
to
appease
germany
regardless
o
whether
it
be
democratic
or
not
indeed
he
do
not
regard
democracy
as
either
necessary
or
good
for
germany
the
milner
group
until
be
still
in
favor
of
a
democratic
germany
because
they
realize
well
than
d
abernon
the
danger
to
civilization
from
an
undemocratic
germany
it
take
the
world
depression
and
its
result
social
unrest
to
bring
the
milner
group
around
to
the
view
which
d
abernon
held
as
early
as
that
appeasement
to
an
undemocratic
germany
could
be
use
as
a
weapon
against
social
disorder
brigadier
general
j
h
morgan
whom
we
have
already
quote
make
perfectly
clear
that
d
abernon
be
one
of
the
chief
obstacle
in
the
path
o
the
interallied
commission
effort
to
force
germany
to
disarm
in
when
von
seeckt
commander
o
the
german
army
sought
modification
of
the
disarmament
rule
which
would
have
permit
large
scale
evasion
of
their
provision
general
morgan
found
it
impossible
to
get
his
dissent
report
accepted
in
london
he
write
in
assize
of
arm
at
the
eleventh
hour
i
manage
to
get
my
report
on
the
implication
of
von
seeckts
plan
brought
to
the
direct
notice
of
mr
lloyd
george
through
the
agency
o
my
friend
philip
kerr
who
after
reading
these
report
advise
the
prime
minister
to
reject
von
seeckts
proposal
reject
they
be
at
the
conference
of
spa
in
july
as
we
shall
see
but
von
seeckt
refuse
to
accept
defeat
and
fell
back
on
a
second
move
when
in
general
morgan
become
gravely
disturbed
at
the
evasion
of
german
disarmament
he
write
a
memorandum
on
the
subject
it
be
suppress
by
lord
d
abernon
morgan
add
in
his
book
i
be
not
altogether
surprised
lord
d
abernon
be
the
apostle
of
appeasement
in
january
this
apostle
of
appeasement
force
the
british
delegation
on
the
disarmament
commission
to
stop
all
inspection
operation
in
germany
they
be
never
resume
although
the
commission
remain
in
germany
for
four
more
year
and
the
french
could
do
nothing
without
the
british
member
throughout
and
d
abernon
put
pressure
on
both
the
german
and
the
british
government
to
pursue
a
policy
on
the
reparation
question
which
be
identical
with
that
which
smut
be
advocate
at
the
same
time
and
in
the
same
quarter
he
put
pressure
on
the
british
government
to
follow
this
policy
on
the
ground
that
any
different
policy
would
lead
to
stresemann
fall
from
office
this
would
result
in
a
very
dangerous
situation
accord
to
d
abernon
and
stresemann
where
germany
might
fall
into
the
control
of
either
the
extreme
left
or
the
extreme
right
for
example
a
minute
of
a
german
cabinet
meeting
of
november
found
by
eric
sutton
among
stresemanns
paper
and
publish
by
him
say
in
part
to
the
english
ambassador
who
make
some
rather
anxious
enquiry
stresemann
state
that
the
maintenance
of
the
state
o
siege
be
absolutely
essential
in
view
of
the
risk
of
a
putsch
both
from
the
left
and
from
the
right
he
would
use
all
his
effort
to
preserve
the
unity
of
the
reich
lord
d
abernon
reply
that
his
view
which
be
share
in
influential
quarter
in
london
be
that
stresemann
be
the
only
man
who
could
steer
the
german
ship
of
state
through
the
present
troubled
water
among
the
quarter
in
london
which
share
this
view
we
find
the
milner
group
the
settlement
which
emerge
from
the
crisis
the
dawes
plan
and
the
evacuation
of
the
ruhr
be
exactly
what
the
milner
group
want
from
that
point
on
to
the
banking
crisis
of
their
satisfaction
continued
in
the
year
they
clearly
have
no
direct
influence
on
affair
chiefly
because
a
labour
government
be
in
office
in
london
but
their
earlier
activity
have
so
predetermine
the
situation
that
it
continued
to
develop
in
the
direction
they
wish
after
the
banking
crisis
of
the
whole
structure
of
international
finance
with
which
the
group
have
be
so
closely
associate
disappear
and
after
a
brief
period
of
doubt
be
replace
by
a
rapid
growth
of
monopolistic
national
capitalism
this
be
accepted
by
the
milner
group
with
hardly
a
break
in
stride
hichens
have
be
deeply
involve
in
monopolistic
heavy
industry
for
a
quarter
o
a
century
in
milner
have
advocate
a
system
o
national
capitalism
with
industrial
self
regulation
behind
tariff
wall
even
earlier
amery
and
others
have
accepted
much
of
this
as
a
method
although
they
do
not
necessarily
embrace
milnefs
rather
socialistic
goal
as
a
result
in
the
period
the
milner
group
willingly
liquidate
reparation
war
debt
and
the
whole
structure
of
international
capitalism
and
embrace
protection
and
cartel
instead
parallel
with
their
destruction
of
reparation
and
in
a
much
more
direct
fashion
the
milner
group
destroyed
collective
security
through
the
league
of
nation
the
group
never
intend
that
the
league
of
nation
should
be
use
to
achieve
collective
security
they
never
intend
that
sanction
either
military
or
economic
should
be
use
to
force
any
aggressive
power
to
keep
the
peace
or
to
enforce
any
political
decision
which
might
be
reach
by
international
agreement
this
must
be
understood
at
the
begin
the
milner
group
never
intend
that
the
league
should
be
use
as
an
instrument
of
collective
security
or
that
sanction
should
be
use
as
an
instrument
by
the
league
from
the
begin
they
expect
only
two
thing
from
the
league
that
it
could
be
use
as
a
center
for
international
cooperation
in
international
administration
in
nonpolitical
matter
and
that
it
could
be
use
as
a
center
for
consultation
in
political
matter
in
regard
to
the
first
point
the
group
regard
the
league
as
a
center
for
such
activity
as
those
previously
exercise
through
the
international
postal
union
in
all
such
activity
as
this
each
state
would
retain
full
sovereignty
and
would
cooperate
only
on
a
completely
voluntary
basis
in
field
o
social
importance
in
regard
to
the
second
point
political
question
no
member
of
the
group
have
any
intention
of
any
state
yield
any
sliver
of
its
full
sovereignty
to
the
league
the
league
be
merely
an
agreement
like
any
treaty
by
which
each
state
bound
itself
to
confer
together
in
a
crisis
and
not
make
war
within
three
month
of
the
submission
of
the
question
to
consultation
the
whole
purpose
o
the
league
be
to
delay
action
in
a
crisis
by
require
this
period
for
consultation
there
be
no
restriction
on
action
after
the
three
month
there
be
some
doubt
within
the
group
as
to
whether
sanction
could
be
use
to
compel
a
state
to
observe
the
three
month
delay
most
of
the
member
o
the
group
say
no
to
this
question
a
few
say
that
economic
sanction
could
be
use
robert
cecil
at
the
begin
at
least
felt
that
political
sanction
might
be
use
to
compel
a
state
to
keep
the
peace
for
the
three
month
but
by
every
member
of
the
group
have
abandon
both
political
and
economic
sanction
for
enforce
the
three
month
delay
there
never
be
within
the
group
any
intention
at
any
time
to
use
sanction
for
any
other
purpose
such
as
keep
peace
after
the
three
month
period
this
then
be
the
point
of
view
of
the
milner
group
in
as
in
unfortunately
in
the
process
of
draw
up
the
covenant
of
the
league
in
certain
phrase
or
implication
be
introduce
into
the
document
under
pressure
from
france
from
woodrow
wilson
and
from
other
group
in
britain
which
could
be
take
to
indicate
that
the
league
might
have
be
intend
to
be
use
as
a
real
instrument
o
collective
security
that
it
might
have
involve
some
minute
limitation
of
state
sovereignty
that
sanction
might
under
certain
circumstance
be
use
to
protect
the
peace
as
soon
as
these
implication
become
clear
the
group
ardor
for
the
league
begin
to
evaporate
when
the
united
state
refuse
to
join
the
league
this
dwindle
ardor
turn
to
hatred
nevertheless
the
group
do
not
abandon
the
league
at
this
point
on
the
contrary
they
tighten
their
grip
on
it
in
order
to
prevent
any
foolish
person
from
use
the
vague
implication
of
the
covenant
in
an
effort
to
make
the
league
an
instrument
o
collective
security
the
group
be
determine
that
i
any
such
effort
as
this
be
make
they
would
prevent
it
and
if
necessary
destroy
the
league
to
prevent
it
only
they
would
insist
in
such
a
case
that
the
league
be
destroyed
not
by
them
but
by
the
person
who
try
to
use
it
as
an
instrument
of
collective
security
all
of
this
may
sound
extreme
unfortunately
it
be
not
extreme
that
this
be
what
the
group
do
to
the
league
be
establish
beyond
doubt
in
history
that
the
group
intend
to
do
this
be
equally
beyond
dispute
the
evidence
be
conclusive
the
british
idea

drew
up

be
alfred

cecil

be
both
dubious

after
the

lord
robert
make
a
speech
at
birmingham
on
the
type
of
league
he
expect
that
speech
show
clearly
that
he
have
little
faith
in
the
possibility
of
disarmament
and
none
in
international
justice
or
military
sanction
to
preserve
the
peace
the
sovereignty
of
each
state
be
left
intact
as
w

rappard
director
of

school
of

study
at
geneva
write
in

conciliation
in
june
he
lord
cecil
be
very
sceptical
about
the
possibility
of
submit
vital
international
question
to
the
judgment
of
court
of
law
and
confess
to
the
gravest
doubt
as
to
the
practicability
of
enforce
the
decree
of
such
court
by
any
form
o
international
force
on
the
other
hand
he
firmly
believe
in
the
efficacy
of
economic
pressure
as
a
mean
of
coerce
a
country
bent
on
aggression
in
violation
of
its
pacific
agreement
m
it
might
be
remark
in
passing
that
the
belief
that
economic
sanction
could
be
use
without
a
backing
o
military
force
or
the
possibility
of
need
such
backing
be
the
one
sure
sign
of
a
novice
in
foreign
politics
and
robert
cecil
could
never
be
call
a
novice
in
such
matter
in
the
speech
itself
he
say
the
most
important
step
we
can
now
take
be
to
devise
machinery
which
in
case
of
international
dispute
will
at
the
least
delay
the
outbreak
of
war
and
secure
full
and
open
discussion
of
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
for
that
purpose
all
that
would
be
necessary
would
be
a
treaty
binding
the
signatory
never
to
wage
war
themselves
or
permit
others
to
wage
war
till
a
formal
conference
of
nation
have
be
held
to
enquire
into
and
if
possible
decide
the
dispute
it
be
probably
true
at
least
in
theory
that
decision
would
be
difficult
to
obtain
for
the
decision
of
such
a
conference
like
all
other
international
proceeding
would
have
to
be
unanimous
to
be
binding
but
since
the
important
thing
be
to
secure
delay
and
open
discussion
that
be
to
say
time
to
enable
public
opinion
to
act
and
information
to
instruct
it
this
be
not
a
serious
objection
to
the
proposal
indeed
from
one
point
of
view
it
be
an
advantage
since
it
avoids
any
interference
with
national
sovereignty
except
the
interposition
of
a
delay
in
seek
redress
by
force
of
arm
this
be
the
essential
thing
to
that
extent
and
to
that
extent
only
international
coercion
would
be
necessary

speech
of

what
it

establish

contract
the

in
fact
so
far
from
invalidate

it
the
work
before
the

the
british
be
horrify
but
with
the
help
of
the
american
be
able
to
shelve
this
suggestion
however
to
satisfy
the
demand
from
their
own
delegation
as
well
as
the
french
they
spread
a
camouflage
of
sham
world
government
over
the
structure
they
have

david

him
to
replace
the

up
by

these
draft

deliberately
drawn
with
loophole
so
that
no

need
ever
be
driven
to
the
point
where

alternative

of

some
of

economic
sanction
but
one
path
which
could
be
freely
chosen
by
the
aggressor
always
available
lead
to
a
loophole
where
no
collective
action
would
be
possible
the
whole
procedure
be
conceal
beneath
a
veil
of
legalistic
terminology
so
that
the
covenant
could
be
present
to
the
public
as
a
watertight
document
but
britain
could
always
escape
from
the
necessity
to
apply
sanction
through
a
loophole
in
spite
of
this
the
milner
group
be
very
dissatisfied
they
try
simultaneously
to
do
three
thing
to
persuade
public
opinion
that
the
league
be
a
wonderful
instrument
of
international
cooperation
design
to
keep
the
peace
to
criticize
the
covenant
for
the
trace
of
a
sham
world
government
which
have
be
thrown
over
it
and
to
reassure
themselves
and
the
ruling
group
in
england
the
dominion
and
the
united
state
that
the
league
be
not
a
world
state
all
of
this
take
a
good
deal
o
neat
footwork
or
more
accurately
nimble
tongue
and
neat
pen
work
more
doubletalk
and
doublewriting
be
emit
by
the
milner
group
on
this
subject
in
the
two
decade
than
be
issue
by
any
other
group
on
this
subject
in
the
period
among
themselves
the
group
do
not
conceal
their
disappointment
with
the
covenant
because
it
go
too
far
in
the
june
issue
of
the
round
table
they
say
reassuringly
the
document
be
not
the
constitution
of
a
super
state
but
as
its
title
explains
a
solemn
agreement
between
sovereign
state
which
consent
to
limit
their
complete
freedom
of
action
on
certain
point
the
league
must
continue
to
depend
on
the
free
consent
in
the
last
resort
o
its
component
state
this
assumption
be
evident
in
nearly
every
article
o
the
covenant
of
which
the
ultimate
and
most
effective
sanction
must
be
the
public
opinion
of
the
civilize
world
if
the
nation
o
the
future
be
in
the
main
selfish
grasp
and
bellicose
no
instrument
or
machinery
will
restrain
them
but
in
the
same
issue
we
read
the
complaint
in
the
imperial
conference
sir
wilfrid
laurier
be
never
tire
of
say
this
be
not
a
government
but
a
conference
of
government
with
government
it
be
a
pity
that
there
be
no
one
in
paris
to
keep
on
say
this
for
the
covenant
be
still
marked
by
the
trace
of
sham
government
by
the
march
issue
the
full
bitterness
of
the
group
on
this
last
point
become
evident
it
say
the
league
have
fail
to
secure
the
adhesion
o
one
o
its
most
important
member
the
united
state
and
be
very
unlikely
to
secure
it
this
situation
present
a
very
serious
problem
for
the
british
empire
we
have
not
only
undertaken
great
obligation
under
the
league
which
we
must
now
both
in
honesty
and
in
self
regard
revise
but
we
have
look
to
the
league
to
provide
us
with
the
machinery
for
united
british
action
in
foreign
affair
my
italic
this
be
the
cat
come
out
of
the
bag
the
article
continued
with
criticism
o
wilson
and
praise
of
the
republican
senate
refusal
to
swallow
the
league
as
it
stood
it
then
say
the
vital
weakness
of
the
treaty
and
the
covenant
become
more
clear
than
ever
in
the
month
succeed
the

at
versailles
a
settlement
base
on
ideal
principle

poetic
justice
can
be
permanently
apply
and
maintain
only
by
a
world
government
to
which
all
nation
will
subordinate
their
private

it
demand
not
only
that
they
should
sacrifice
their
private
interest
to
this
world
interest

also
that
they
should
be

to

the
claim
of
world
interest
even
in
matter
where
their
own
interest
be
in
no
wise
engage
it
demand
in
fact
that
they
should
subordinate
their
national
sovereignty
to
an
international
code
and
an
international
ideal
the
reservation
of
the
american
senate
point
the
practical
difficulty
of
this
ideal
with
simple
force
all
the
reservation
be
affirmation
of
the
sovereign
right
of
the
american
people
to
make
their
own
policy
without
interference
from
an
international
league
none
of
these
reservation
it
should
be
note
contravenes
the
general
aim
of
the
league
but
they
be
one
and
all
direct
to
ensure
that
no
action
be
take
in
pursuit
of
those
aim
except
with
the
consent
and
approval
of
the
congress
there
be
nothing
peculiar
in
this
attitude
it
be
merely
we
repeat
the
broad
reflex
of
an
attitude
already
take
up
by
all
the
european
ally
in
question
where
their
national
interest
be
affected
and
also
by
the
british
dominion
in
their
relation
with
the
british
government
it
give
us
a
statement
in
plain
english
of
the
iimitations
to
the
ideal
of
international
action
which
none
of
the
other
ally
will
in
practice
dispute
so
far
therefore
from
destroy
the
league
of
nation
the
american
reservation
have
render
it
the
great
service
of
point
clearly
to
the
flaw
which
at
present
neutralize
its
worth
among
these
flaw
in
the
opinion
of
the
milner
group
be
the
fact
that
their
plan
to
use
the
league
of
nation
as
a
method
o
tie
the
dominion
more
closely
to
the
united
kingdom
have
fail
and
instead
the
covenant
give
the
dominion
the
ground
or
rather
the
excuse
to
avoid
closer
union
with
the
united
kingdom
it
have
be
found
in
paris
that
in
order
to
preserve
its
unity
the
british
delegation
must
meet
frequently
as
a
delegation
to
discus
its
policy
before
meeting
the
representative
of
foreign
nation
in
conference
how
be
this
unity
of
action
to
be
maintain
after
the
signature
of
peace
without
commit
the
dominion
government
to
some
new
constitutional
organization
within
the
commonwealth
and
if
some
new
constitutional
organization
be
to
be
devise
for
this
purpose
how
could
it
fail
to
limit
in
some
way
the
full
national
independent
status
which
the
dominion
government
have
just
achieve
by
their
recognition
as
individual
member
of
the
league
of
nation
the
answer
to
these
question
be
found
in
cooperation
within
the
league
which
be
to
serve
not
only
as
the
link
between
the
british
empire
and
foreign
power
but
as
the
link
also
between
the
constituent
nation
of
the
british
empire
itself
imbue
with
this
idea
the
dominion
statesman
accepted
obligation
to
foreign
power
under
the
covenant
of
the
league
more
binding
than
any
obligation
which
they
would
undertake
to
their
kindred
nation
within
the
british
empire
in
other
word
they
mortgage
their
freedom
of
action
to
a
league
of
foreign
state
in
order
to
avoid
the
possibility
o
mortgage
it
to
the
british
government
it
hardly
require
the
reservation
o
the
american
senate
to
demonstrate
the
illusory
character
of
this
arrangement
the
british
dominion
have
make
no
such
reservation
with
regard
to
the
covenant
and
they
be
therefore
bound
by
the
obligation
which
have
be
reject
by
the
united
state
canada
australia
south
africa
and
new
zealand
be
in
fact
bound
by
strong
write
obligation
to
poland
and
czechoslovakia
than
to
the
british
isle
it
be
almost
needle
to
observe
that
none
of
the
democracy
of
the
british
empire
have
grasped
the
extent
of
its
obligation
to
the
league
of
nation
or
would
hesitate
to
repudiate
them
at
once
if
put
to
the
test
i
england
be
threaten
by
invasion
the
other
british
domocracies
would
mobilize
at
once
for
her
support
but
though
they
have
a
write
obligation
to
poland
which
they
have
never
dream
o
give
to
england
they
would
not
in
practice
mobilise
a
single
man
to
defend
the
integrity
of
the
corridor
to
danzig
or
any
other
polish
territorial
interest
this
be
a
dangerous
and
equivocal
situation
it
be
time
that
our
democracy
review
and
correct
it
with
the
clearness
of
vision
and
candour
of
statement
displayed
by
the
much
abuse
senate
of
the
united
state
to
what
course
of
action
do
these
conclusion
point
they
point
in
the
first
place
to
revision
of
our
obligation
under
the
league
we
be
at
present
pledge
to
guarantee
of
territorial
arrangement
in
europe
which
may
be
challenged
at
any
time
by
force
too
powerful
for
diplomatic
control
and
it
be
become
evident
that
in
no
part
of
the
empire
would
public
opinion
sanction
our
active
interference
in
the
local
dispute
which
may
ensue
the
polish
corridor
to
danzig
be
a
case
in
point
our
proper
course
be
to
revise
and
restate
our
position
towards
the
league
in
accordance
with
these
fact
first
we
wish
to
do
our
utmost
to
guarantee
peace
liberty
and
law
throughout
the
world
without
commit
ourselves
to
quixotic
obligation
to
foreign
state
second
we
wish
to
assist
and
develop
the
simple
mechanism
of
international
deal
embody
in
the
league
without
mortgage
our
freedom
of
action
and
judgment
under
an
international
covenant
our
policy
toward
the
league
should
therefore
be
revise
on
the
follow
guide
line
we
should
state
definitely
that
our
action
within
the
league
will
be
govern
solely
by
our
own
judgment
of
every
situation
as
it
arises
and
we
must
undertake
no
general
obligation
which
we
may
not
be
able
or
willing
when
the
test
come
to
discharge
we
must
in
no
case
commit
ourselves
to
responsibility
which
we
cannot
discharge
to
the
full
with
our
own
resource
independent
of
assistance
from
any
foreign
power
we
must
definitely
renounce
the
idea
that
the
league
may
normally
enforce
its
opinion
by
military
or
economic
pressure
on
the
recalcitrant
state
it
exists
to
bring
principal
together
for
open
discussion
of
international
di
iculties
to
extend
and
develop
the
mechanism
and
habit
of
international
cooperation
and
to
establish
an
atmosphere
in
which
international
controversy
may
be
settle
with
fairness
and
goodwill
with
the
less
ambitious
object
define
above
it
will
sooner
or
later
secure
the
whole
hearted
support
of
american
opinion
the
influence
of
the
league
of
nation
upon
british
imperial
relation
have
for
the
moment
be
mislead
and
dangerous
it
be
only
a
question
of
time
before
this
situation
lead
to
an
incident
of
some
kind
which
will
provoke
the
bitter
recrimination
and
controversy
in
the
lead

of

wilson
for
corrupt
the

into
a
pseudo
world

add
sham

fundamentally
different
structure
base
on
consultation
of

instead
of

the

adequately

in

for
the

of
ver
sally
and
the
league
of
nation
be
share
by
the
french
but
for
quite
opposite
reason
the
french
felt
insecure
in
the
face
of
germany
because
they
realize
that
france
have
beaten
germany
in
only
because
of
the
happy
fact
that
she
have
russia
great
britain
italy
and
the
united
state
to
help
her
from
onward
france
have
no
guarantee
that
in
any
future
attack
by
germany
she
would
have
any
such
assistance
to
be
sure
the
french
knew
that
britain
must
come
to
the
aid
o
france
i
there
be
any
danger
of
germany
defeat
france
the
milner
group
knew
this
too
but
france
want
some
arrangement
by
which
britain
would
be
alongside
france
from
the
first
moment
of
a
german
attack
since
the
french
have
no
assurance
that
they
could
withstand
a
german
onslaught
alone
even
for
a
brief
period
moreover
if
they
could
the
french
be
afraid
that
the
opening
onslaught
would
deliver
to
the
german
control
of
the
most
productive
part
of
france
as
capture
territory
this
be
what
have
happen
in
to
avoid
this
the
french
sought
in
vain
one
alternative
after
another
a
to
detach
from
germany
or
at
least
to
occupy
for
an
extend
period
the
rhineland
area
of
germany
this
would
put
the
ruhr
the
most
vital
industrial
area
of
germany
within
strike
distance
of
french
force
b
to
get
a
british
american
or
at
least
a
british
guarantee
of
french
territory
c
to
get
a
league
of
nation
with
teeth
that
be
one
with
its
own
police
force
and
power
to
act
automatically
against
an
aggressor
all
of
these
be
block
by
the
english
and
american
at
the
peace
conference
in
the
french
sought
substitute
of
these
the
only
one
they
obtain
be
a
system
of
alliance
with
new
state
like
poland
czechoslovakia
and
the
enlarge
rumania
on
the
east
of
germany
all
o
these
state
be
of
limited
power
and
the
french
have
little
faith
in
the
effectiveness
of
their
assistance
accordingly
the
french
continued
to
seek
their
other
aim
to
extend
the
fifteen
year
occupation
of
the
rhineland
into
a
longer
or
even
an
indefinite
period
to
get
some
kind
o
british
guarantee
to
strengthen
the
league
of
nation
by
plug
the
gap
in
the
covenant
to
use
the
leverage
of
reparation
and
disarmament
as
provide
in
the
treaty
of
versailles
to
keep
germany
down
to
wreck
her
economically
or
even
to
occupy
the
ruhr
all
of
these
effort
be
block
by
the
machination
of
the
milner
group
at
the
moment
we
shall
refer
only
to
the
effort
to

the
gap
in

these
gap

milner
group
the
chief
effort
of
the
french
and
their
ally
on
the
continent
to
plug
the
gap
be
the
draft
treaty
of
mutual
assistance
and
the
geneva
protocol
what
the
milner
group
thought
of
both
of
these
can
be
gather
from
the
follow
extract
from
the
round
table
denunciation
of
the
protocol
in
the
december
issue
in
an
article
entitle
the
british
commonwealth
the
protocol
and
the
league
we
find
the
follow
what
be
to
be
the
british
answer
to
this
invitation
to
reenter
the
stormy
field
of
internal
european
politics
can
the
british
commonwealth
afford
to
become
permanently
bound
up
with
the
internal
political
structure
o
europe
and
will
it
promote
the
peace
and
stability
of
europe
or
the
world
that
europe
should
attempt
to
solve
its
problem
on
the
basis
of
a
permanent
british
guarantee
the
answer
in
our
judgment
to
both
these
question
must
be
an
emphatic
no
then
after
repeat
its
contention
that
the
only
purpose
of
the
covenant
be
to
secure
delay
in
a
crisis
for
consultation
it
continued
the
idea
that
all
nation
ought
to
consult
how
they
be
to
deal
with
state
which
precipitate
war
without
allow
any
period
for
enquiry
and
mediation
be
the
real
heart
of
the
league
of
nation
and
if
the
british
commonwealth
want
to
prevent
a
recurrence
of
the
great
war
it
must
be
willing
to
recognize
that
it
have
a
vital
interest
in
work
out
with
other
nation
the
best
manner
of
give
effect
to
this
fundamental
idea
decision
as
to
the
right
and
wrong
of
international
dispute
and
o
what
common
action
the
nation
should
take
when
they
be
call
together
to
deal
with
such
an
outlaw
must
be
left
to
be
determine
in
the
light
of
the
circumstance
of
the
time
the
view
of
the
round
table
be
that
the
british
commonwealth
should
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
it
will
accept
no
far
obligation
than
this
and
that
the
covenant
of
the
league
must
be
amend
to
establish
beyond
question
that
no
authority
neither
the
council
nor
any
arbitral
body
it
may
appoint
have
any
power
to
render
a
binding
decision
or
to
order
a
war
except
with
the
consent
of
the
member
themselves
the
bitterness
of
the
group
feeling
against
france
at
the
time
appear
in
the
same
article
a
couple
of
page
later
when
it
ask
or
be
the
proposal
implicit
in
the
protocol
merely
one
for
transfer
to
the
shoulder
of
great
britain
which
alone
be
pay
her
debt
some
part
o
the
cost
o
maintain
that
preponderance
which
now
rest
upon
the
european
state
which
profit
most
by
it
it
be
sheer
rubbish
to
suggest
that
france
need
military
guarantee
for
security
what
france
really
want
be
a
guarantee
that
the
ally
will
maintain
a
perpetual
preponderance
over
germany
this
we
can
never
give
her
for
in
the
long
run
it
make
not
for
peace
but
for
war
in
another
article
in
the
same
issue
the
protocol
be
analyze
and
denounce
the
final
conclusion
be
it
be
our
firm
conviction
that
no
alternative
be
acceptable
which
fails
to
provide
for
the
free
exercise
by
the
parliament
and
people
of
the
empire
of
their
judgment
as
to
how
to
deal
with
any
disturbance
o
the
peace
or
any
threat
of
such
disturbance
on
its
merit
as
it
arises
that
have
be
the
guide
principle
throughout
the
political
history
of
the
british
people
the
method
of
the
protocol
belong
to
another
world
and
if
for
no
other
reason
they
should
be
reject
the
protocol
be
officially
reject
by
austen
chamberlain
at
a
session
of
the
council
o
the
league
of
nation
in
march

go
to
geneva
to
be

after
the

do
they
go
to

by

to
brand
letter
which
brand
later
publish
in
his
edition
o
the
letter
of
john
dove
one
of
the
reason
give
by
austen
chamberlain
in
for
reject
the
geneva
protocol
be
the
opposition
of
the
dominion
that
the
milner
group
be
able
to
affect
dominion
opinion
on
this
subject
be
clear
they
could
use
men
like
massey
and
glazebrook
in
canada
bavin
and
eggleston
in
australia
downie
stewart
and
allen
in
new
zealand
smut
and
duncan
in
south
africa
more
important
than
the
milner
group
ability
to
influence
opinion
in
the
dominion
be
its
ability
to
influence
decision
in
london
in
much
of
this
latter
field
lord
esher
undoubtedly
played
an
important
role
it
be
perfectly
clear
that
lord
esher
disliked
collective
security
and
for
the
same
reason
as
the
round
table
this
can
be
see
in
his
publish
journal
and
letter
for
example
on
february
in
a
letter
to
hankey
he
write
ui
fervently
believe
that
the
happiness
and
welfare
of
the
human
race
be
more
closely
concerned
in
the
evolution
of
english
democracy
and
o
our
imperial
commonwealth
than
in
the
growth
of
any
international
league
on
december
in
another
letter
to
hankey
he
write
you
say
that
my
letter
be
critical
and
not
constructive
so
it
be
but
the
ground
must
be
clear
of
debris
first
i
assume
that
this
be
do
we
will
forget
the
high
ideal
and
the
fourteen
point
for
the
moment
we
will
be
eminently
practical
so
here
go
do
not
let
us
bother
about
a
league
of
nation
it
may
come
slowly
or
not
at
all
what
step
forward
if
any
can
we
take
we
can
get
a
league
o
empire
shortly
afterwards
write
to
his
heir
the
present
viscount
esher
he
call
the
league
a
paper
hoop
the
importance
of
this
can
be
see
if
we
realize
that
lord
esher
be
the
most
important
factor
on
the
committee
o
imperial
defence
and
this
committee
be
one
of
the
chief
force
determine
british
foreign
policy
in
this
period
in
fact
no
less
an
authority
than
lord
robert
cecil
have
say
that
the
geneva
protocol
be
reject
on
the
ad
vice
of
the
committee
of
imperial
defence
and
that
he
accepted
that
decision
only
when
he
be
promise
a
new
project
which
subsequently
become
the
locarno
pact
the
rejection
o
the
protocol
by
britain
be
regard
subsequently
by
real
supporter
of
the
league
as
the
turn
point
in
its
career
there
be
an
outburst
of
public
sentiment
against
this
selfish
and
coldblooded
action
zimmern
who
knew
more
than
he
reveal
go
to
oxford
in
may
and
make
a
brilliant
speech
against
those
who
be
sabotage
the
league
he
do
not
identify
them
but
clearly
indicate
their
existence
and
as
the
crudest
blow
o
all
attribute
their
action
to
a
failure
o
intelligence
as
a
result
of
this
feel
which
be
widespread
throughout
the
world
the
group
determine
to
give
the
world
the
appearance
o
a
guarantee
to
france
this
be
do
in
the
locarno
pact
the
most
complicate
and
most
deceitful
international
agreement
make
between
the
treaty
of
versailles
and
the
munich
pact
we
cannot
discus
them
in
detail
here
but
must
content
ourselves
with
point
out
that
in
appearance
and
in
the
publicity
campaign
which
accompany
their
formation
the
locarno
agreement
guaranteed
the
frontier
of
germany
with
france
and
belgium
with
the
power
of
these
three
state
plus
britain
and
italy
in
reality
the
agreement
give
france
nothing
while
they
give
britain
a
veto
over
french
fulfillment
of
her
alliance
with
poland
and
the
little
entente
the
french
accepted
these
deceptive
document
for
reason
of
internal
politics
obviously
any
french
government
which
could
make
the
french
people
believe
that
it
have
be
able
to
secure
a
british
guarantee
of
france
eastern
frontier
could
expect
the
gratitude
of
the
french
people
to
be
reflect
at
the
poll
the
fundamental
shrewdness
and
realism
of
the
french
however
make
it
difficult
to
conceal
from
them
the
trap
that
lay
in
the
locarno
agreement
this
trap
consist
of
several
interlock
factor
in
the
first
place
the
agreement
do
not
guarantee
the
german
frontier
and
the
demilitarize
condition
of
the
rhineland
against
german
action
but
against
the
action
of
either
germany
or
france
this
at
one
stroke
give
britain
the
legal
ground
for
oppose
france
if
she
try
any
repetition
of
the
military
occupation
o
the
ruhr
and
above
all
give
britain
the
right
to
oppose
any
french
action
against
germany
in
support
of
her
ally
to
the
east
of
germany
this
meant
that
if
germany
move
east
against
czechoslovakia
poland
and
eventually
russia
and
if
france
attack
germany
western
frontier
in
support
of
czechoslovakia
or
poland
as
her
alliance
bound
her
to
do
great
britain
belgium
and
italy
might
be
bound
by
the
locarno
pact
to
come
to
the
aid
of
germany
to
be
sure
the
same
agreement
might
bind
these
three
power
to
oppose
germany
if
she
drove
westward
against
france
but
the
milner
group
do
not
object
to
this
for
several
reason
in
the
first
place
if
germany
attack
france
directly
britain
would
have
to
come
to
the
help
o
france
whether
bound
by
treaty
or
not
the
old
balance
of
power
principle
make
that
clear
in
the
second
place
cecil
hurst
the
old
master
of
legalistic
doubletalk
drew
up
the
locarno
pact
with
the
same
kind
o
loophole
which
he
have
put
in
the
crucial
article
of
the
covenant
as
a
result
i
germany
do
violate
the
locarno
pact
against
france
britain
could
if
she
desire
escape
the
necessity
of
fulfil
her
guarantee
by
slip
through
one
of
hurst
loophole
as
a
matter
of
fact
when
hitler
do
violate
the
locarno
agreement
by
remilitarize
the
rhineland
in
march
the
milner
group
and
their
friend
do
not
even
try
to
evade
their
obligation
by
slip
through
a
loophole
but
simply
dishonor
their
agreement
this
event
of
march
by
which
hitler
remilitarize
the
rhineland
be
the
most
crucial
event
in
the
whole
history
of
appeasement
so
long
as
the
territory
west
of
the
rhine
and
a
strip
fifty
kilometer
wide
on
the
east
bank
of
the
river
be
demilitarize
as
provide
in
the
treaty
of
versailles
and
the
locarno
pact
hitler
would
never
have
dare
to
move
against
austria
czechoslovakia
and
poland
he
would
not
have
dare
because
with
western
germany
unfortified
and
denude
of
german
soldier
france
could
have
easily
driven
into
the
ruhr
industrial
area
and
cripple
germany
so
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
go
eastward
and
by
this
date
certain
member
of
the
milner
group
and
of
the
british
conservative
government
have
reach
the
fantastic
idea
that
they
could
kill
two
bird
with
one
stone
by
set
germany
and
russia
against
one
another
in
eastern
europe
in
this
way
they
felt
that
the
two
enemy
would
stalemate
one
another
or
that
germany
would
become
satisfied
with
the
oil
of
rumania
and
the
wheat
o
the
ukraine
it
never
occur
to
anyone
in
a
responsible
position
that
germany
and
russia
might
make
common
cause
even
temporarily
against
the
west
even
less
do
it
occur
to
them
that
russia
might
beat
germany
and
thus
open
all
central
europe
to
bolshevism
this
idea
o
bring
germany
into
a
collision
with
russia
be
not
to
be
found
so
far
as
the
evidence
show
among
any
member
o
the
inner
circle
of
the
milner
group
rather
it
be
to
be
found
among
the
personal
associate
of
neville
chamberlain
include
several
member
of
the
second
circle
o
the
milner
group
the
two
policy
follow
parallel
course
until
march
after
that
date
the
milner
group
disintegration
become
very
evident
and
part
of
it
take
the
form
of
the
movement
of
several
person
like
hoare
and
simon
from
the
second
circle
of
the
milner
group
to
the
inner
circle
of
the
new
group
rotate
around
chamberlain
this
process
be
conceal
by
the
fact
that
this
new
group
be
follow
in
public
at
least
the
policy
desire
by
the
milner
group
their
own
policy
which
be
really
the
continuation
of
appeasement
for
another
year
after
march
be
necessarily
secret
so
that
the
contrast
between
the
chamberlain
group
and
the
inner
circle
of
the
milner
group
in
the
period
after
march
be
not
as
obvious
as
it
might
have
be
in
order
to
carry
out
this
plan
o
allow
germany
to
drive
eastward
against
russia
it
be
necessary
to
do
three
thing
to
liquidate
all
the
country
stand
between
germany
and
russia
to
prevent
france
from
honor
her
alliance
with
these
country
and
to
hoodwink
the
english
people
into
accept
this
as
a
necessary
indeed
the
only
solution
to
the
international
problem
the
chamberlain
group
be
so
successful
in
all
three
of
these
thing
that
they
come
within
an
ace
of
succeed
and
fail
only
because
of
the
obstinacy
of
the
pole
the
unseemly
haste
of
hitler
and
the
fact
that
at
the
eleventh
hour
the
milner
group
realize
the
implication
of
their
policy
and
try
to
reverse
it
the
program
of
appeasement
can
be
divide
into
three
stage
the
first
from
to
the
second
from
to
and
the
third
from
to
the
story
o
the
first
period
we
have
almost
complete
except
for
the
evacuation
of
the
rhineland
in
five
year
ahead
of
the
date
set
in
the
treaty
of
versailles
it
would
be
too
complicate
a
story
to
narrate
here
the
method
by
which
france
be
persuade
to
yield
on
this
point
it
be
enough
to
point
out
that
france
be
persuade
to
withdraw
her
troop
in
rather
than
as
a
result
of
what
she
believe
to
be
concession
make
to
her
in
the
young
plan
that
the
milner
group
approve
this
evacuation
go
without
say
we
have
already
mention
the
round
table
demand
of
june
that
the
rhineland
be
evacuate
a
similar
desire
will
be
found
in
a
letter
from
john
dove
to
brand
in
october
the
second
period
of
appeasement
begin
with
smut
famous
speech
of
november
deliver
before
the
riia
the
whole
of
this
significant
speech
deserves
to
be
quote
here
but
we
must
content
ourselves
with
a
few
extract
with
all
the
emphasis
at
my
command
i
would
call
a
halt
to
this
war
talk
as
mischievous
and
dangerous
war
propaganda
the
expectation
of
war
tomorrow
or
in
the
near
future
be
sheer
nonsense
and
all
those
who
be
conversant
with
affair
know
it
the
remedy
for
this
fear
complex
be
bring
it
into
the
open
and
expose
it
to
the
light
of
day
and
this
be
exactly
the
method
of
the
league
of
nation
it
be
an
open
forum
for
discussion
among
the
nation
it
be
a
round
table
for
the
statesman
around
which
they
can
ventilate
and
debate
their
grievance
and
viewpoint
there
be
those
who
say
that
this
be
not
enough
that
as
long
as
the
league
remains
merely
a
talk
shop
or
debate
society
and
be
not
furnish
with
teeth
and
proper
sanction
the
sense
of
insecurity
will
remain
it
be
also
felt
that
the
inability
of
the
league
to
guarantee
the
collective
system
by
mean
o
force
if
necessary
be
discredit
it
and
lead
to
its
decay
i
cannot
visualize
the
league
as
a
military
machine
it
be
not
conceive
or
built
for
that
purpose
it
be
not
equip
for
such
function
and
if
ever
the
attempt
be
make
to
transform
it
into
a
military
machine
into
a
system
to
carry
on
war
for
the
purpose
of
prevent
war
i
think
its
fate
be
seal
defection
o
the
united
state
have
largely
defeat
its
main
object
and
the
join
up
o
the
united
state
must
continue
to
be
the
ultimate
goal
of
all
true
friend
of
the
league
and
of
the
cause
of
peace
a
conference
of
the
nation
the
united
state
can
and
eventually
will
join
it
can
never
join
an
international
war
office
remember
the
debate
on
this
point
in
the
league
of
nation
commission
which
draft
the
covenant
i
say
quite
definitely
that
the
very
idea
o
a
league
of
force
be
negative
there
and
the
league
would
be
quite
false
to
its
fundamental
idea
and
to
its
great
mission
if
it
allow
itself
to
be
turn
into
something
quite
different
something
just
the
opposite
of
its
original
idea
into
a
league
of
force
to
endeavor
to
cast
out
the
satan
of
fear
by
call
in
the
beelzebub
of
militarism
and
militarize
the
league
itself
would
be
a
senseless
and
indeed
fatal
proceed
the
removal
of
the
inferiority
complex
from
germany
be
just
as
essential
to
future
peace
as
the
removal
o
fear
from
the
mind
of
france
and
both
be
essential
to
an
effective
disarmament
policy
how
can
the
inferiority
complex
which
be
obsess
and
i
fear
poison
the
mind
and
indeed
the
soul
of
germany
be
remove
there
be
only
one
way
and
that
be
to
recognize
her
complete
equality
of
status
with
her
fellow
and
to
do
so
frankly
freely
and
unreservedly
that
be
the
only
medicine
for
her
disease
while
one
understands
and
sympathizes
with
french
fear
one
cannot
but
feel
for
germany
in
the
position
of
inferiority
in
which
she
still
remains
sixteen
year
after
the
conclusion
o
the
war
the
continuance
of
her
versailles
status
be
become
an
offense
to
the
conscience
of
europe
and
a
danger
to
future
peace
there
be
no
place
in
international
law
for
second
rate
nation
and
least
of
all
should
germany
be
kept
in
that
position
fair
play
sportsmanship
indeed
every
standard
of
private
and
public
life
call
for
frank
revision
of
the
position
indeed
ordinary
prudence
make
it
imperative
let
us
break
those
bond
and
set
the
captive
obsess
soul
free
in
a
decent
human
way
and
europe
will
reap
a
rich
reward
in
tranquillity
security
and
return
prosperity
i
would
say
that
to
me
the
future
policy
and
association
of
our
great
british
commonwealth
lie
more
with
the
united
state
than
with
any
other
group
in
the
world
if
ever
there
come
a
part
of
the
way
if
ever
in
the
crisis
of
the
future
we
be
call
upon
to
make
a
choice
that
it
seem
to
me
should
be
the
company
we
should
prefer
to
walk
with
and
march
with
to
the
unknown
future
nobody
can
forecast
the
outcome
of
the
stormy
era
of
history
on
which
we
be
probably
enter
at
the
time
that
smut
make
this
significant
speech
the
milner
group
have
already
indicate
to
hitler
officially
that
britain
be
prepared
to
give
germany
arm
equality
france
have
greet
the
arrival
to
power
of
hitler
by
desperate
effort
to
form
an
eastern
locarno
against
germany
sir
john
simon
who
be
foreign
secretary
from
september
to
june
repudiate
these
effort
on
july
in
a
speech
which
be
approve
by
the
time
the
follow
day
he
warn
the
french
that
britain
would
not
approve
any
effort
to
build
up
one
combination
against
another
would
refuse
to
assume
any
new
obligation
herself
would
insist
that
russia
join
the
league
of
nation
before
she
become
a
party
to
any
multilateral
settlement
and
insist
on
arm
equality
for
germany
on
the
same
day
austen
chamberlain
laid
the
groundwork
for
the
german
remilitarization
of
the
rhineland
by
a
speech
in
which
he
insist
that
the
locarno
agreement
do
not
bind
britain
to
use
troop
he
clearly
indicate
how
britain
by
her
veto
power
in
the
council
of
the
league
could
prevent
a
league
request
to
provide
troop
to
enforce
locarno
and
add
that
such
a
request
would
not
be
binding
on
britain
even
if
vote
since
there
be
no
automatic
obligation
under
the
government
to
send
our
army
to
any
frontier
in
a
debate
in
the
house
of
lord
on
december
lord
cecil
contradict
smut
statement
that
the
idea
of
a
league
of
force
be
negative
in
and
restate
his
own
view
that
force
should
be
available
to
compel
the
observance
of
the
three
month
moratorium
between
the
settlement
of
a
question
by
the
council
and
the
outbreak
o
war
he
say
the
thing
which
we
be
most
anxious
to
secure
against
a
renewal
of
a
great
war
be
that
there
should
be
collective
action
to
prevent
a
sudden
outbreak
of
war
it
be
never
part
of
the
covenant
system
that
force
should
be
use
in
order
to
compel
some
particular
settlement
of
a
dispute
that
we
thought
be
go
beyond
what
public
opinion
of
the
world
would
support
but
we
do
think
we
could
go
so
far
as
to
say
you
be
not
to
resort
to
war
until
every
other
mean
for
bring
about
a
settlement
have
be
exhaust
this
be
merely
a
restatement
of
the
point
of
view
that
lord
cecil
have
held
since
it
do
not
constitute
collective
security
as
the
expression
be
use
by
the
world
in
general
yet
this
use
of
the
word
collective
security
to
mean
the
enforcement
of
a
three
month
moratorium
before
issue
a
declaration
of
war
this
weaker
meaning
be
be
weaken
even
far
by
the
milner
group
this
be
make
perfectly
clear
in
a
speech
by
lord
lothian
philip
kerr
immediately
after
lord
cecil
on
this
day
the
latter
part
from
the
milner
group
program
of
appeasement
more
than
ten
year
after
zimmern
this
defection
be
o
less
significance
than
the
earlier
one
because
lord
cecil
do
not
see
clearly
what
be
be
do
and
he
have
never
be
apparently
a
member
of
the
inner
circle
of
the
group
although
he
have
attend
meeting
of
the
inner
circle
in
the
period
after
lord
lothians
speech
of
december
in
the
house
of
lord
be
at
first
glance
a
defense
of
collective
security
but
a
second
look
show
clearly
that
by
mcollective
security
the
speaker
meant
appeasement
he
contrast
collective
security
with
power
diplomacy
and
have
exclude
all
use
o
force
under
the
former
expression
go
on
to
interpret
it
to
mean
peaceful
change
without
war
in
the
context
o
event
this
could
only
mean
appeasement
of
germany
he
say
in
international
affair
unless
change
be
make
in
time
war
becomes
inevitable
if
the
collective
system
be
to
be
successful
it
must
contain
two
element
on
the
one
hand
it
must
be
able
to
bring
about
by
pacific
mean
alteration
in
the
international
structure
and
on
the
other
hand
it
must
be
strong
enough
to
restrain
power
who
seek
to
take
the
law
into
their
own
hand
either
by
war
or
by
power
diplomacy
from
be
successful
in
their
effort
this
be
nothing
but
the
appeasement
program
of
chamberlain
and
halifax
that
concession
should
be
make
to
germany
to
strengthen
her
on
the
continent
and
in
eastern
europe
while
britain
should
remain
strong
enough
on
the
sea
and
in
the
air
to
prevent
hitler
from
use
war
to
obtain
these
concession
the
fear
of
hitler
use
war
be
base
not
so
much
on
a
dislike
o
force
neither
lothian
nor
halifax
be
a
pacifist
in
that
sense
but
on
the
realization
that
if
hitler
make
war
against
austria
czechoslovakia
or
poland
public
opinion
in
france
and
england
might
force
their
government
to
declare
war
in
spite
o
their
desire
to
yield
these
area
to
germany
this
of
course
be
what
finally
happen
hitler
be
give
ample
assurance
by
the
milner
group
both
within
and
without
the
government
that
britain
would
not
oppose
his
effort
to
achieve
arm
equality
four
day
before
germany
officially
denounce
the
disarmament
clause
of
the
treaty
of
versailles
leopold
amery
make
a
slash
attack
on

the

which
exists
and
the

of

a
cloud
cuckoo

dream
o
a
millennium
which
we
be
not
likely
to
reach
for
many
a
long
year
to
come
a

be
to

whenever

that
sort

if
it

it
would
be

to
put

dangerous

not
it

in
may
the
british
counteract
this
by
make
the
anglo
german
naval
agreement
of
june
this
agreement
conclude
by
simon
allow
germany
to
build
up
to
percent
of
the
size
of
the
british
navy
and
up
to
percent
in
submarine
this
be
a
deadly
stab
in
the
back
to
france
for
it
give
germany
a
navy
considerably
large
than
the
french
in
the
important
category
o
ship
capital
ship
and
aircraft
carrier
in
the
north
sea
because
france
be
bound
by
treaty
in
these
category
to
only
percent
of
britain
s
and
france
in
addition
have
a
worldwide
empire
to
protect
and
the
unfriendly
italian
navy
off
her
mediterranean
coast
this
agreement
put
the
french
atlantic
coast
so
completely
at
the
mercy
of
the
german
navy
that
france
become
completely
dependent
on
the
british
fleet
for
protection
in
this
area
obviously
this
protection
would
not
be
give
unless
france
in
a
crisis
renounce
her
eastern
ally
as
if
this
be
not
enough
britain
in
march
accepted
the
german
remilitarization
of
the
rhineland
and
in
august
begin
the
farcical
nonintervention
agreement
in
spain
which
put
another
unfriendly
government
on
france
remain
land
frontier
under
such
pressure
it
be
clear
that
france
would
not
honor
her
alliance
with
the
czech
the
pole
or
the
russian
if
they
come
due
in
these
action
of
march
and
march
hitler
be
run
no
risk
for
the
government
and
the
milner
group
have
assure
him
beforehand
that
it
would
accept
his
action
this
be
do
both
in
public
and
in
private
chiefly
in
the
house
of
common
and
in
the
article
of
the
time
within
the
cabinet
halifax
simon
and
hoare
resist
the
effort
to
form
any
alignment
against
germany
the
authorize
biographer
o
halifax
write
in
reference
to
halifax
s
attitude
in
and
be
england
to
allow
herself
to
be
drawn
into
war
because
france
have
alliance
in
eastern
europe
be
she
to
give
mussolini
a
free
pas
to
addis
ababa
merely
to
prevent
hitler
march
to
vienna
question
similar
to
these
be
undoubtedly
pose
by
halifax
in
cabinet
his
own
friend
in
particular
lothian
and
geoffrey
dawson
of
the
time
have
for
some
time
be
promote
anglo
german
fellowship
with
rather
more
fervour
than
the
foreign
office
in
january
lothian
have
a
long
conversation
with
hitler
and
hitler
be
repute
to
have
propose
an
alliance
between
england
germany
and
the
united
state
which
would
in
effect
give
germany
a
free
hand
on
the
continent
in
return
for
which
he
have
promise
not
to
make
germany
a
world
power
or
to
attempt
to
compete
with
the
british
navy
the
time
consistently
oppose
the
eastern
locarno
and
back
hitler
non
aggression
alternative
two
day
before
the
berlin
talk
for
instance
it
advocate
that
they
should
include
territorial
change
and
in
particular
the
question
of
memel
while
on
the
day
they
begin
march
its
lead
article
suggest
that
if
herr
hitler
can
persuade
his
british
visitor
and
through
them
the
rest
of
the
world
that
his
enlarge
army
be
really
design
to
give
them
equality
of
status
and
equality
of
negotiation
with
other
country
and
be
not
to
be
train
for
aggressive
purpose
then
europe
may
be
on
the
threshold
o
an
era
in
which
change
can
be
make
without
the
use
of
force
and
a
potential
aggressor
may
be
deter
by
the
certain
prospect
of
have
to
face
overwhelm
opposition
how
far
the
time
and
lothian
be
argue
and
negotiate
on
the
government
behalf
be
still
not
clear
but
that
halifax
be
intimately
acquaint
with
the
trend
of
this
argument
be
probable
it
go
without
say
that
the
whole
inner
core
of
the
group
and
their
chief
publication
such
as
the
time
and
the
round
table
approve
the
policy
of
appeasement
completely
and
prod
it
along
with
calculate
indiscretion
when
it
be
felt
necessary
to
do
so
after
the
remilitarization
o
the
rhineland
the
time
cynically
call
this
act
a
chance
to
rebuild
m
as
late
as
february
in
the
house
o
lord
lothian
defend
the
same
event
he
say
we
hear
a
great
deal
of
the
violation
by
herr
hitler
of
the
treaty
because
he
return
his
own
troop
to
his
own
frontier
you
hear
much
less
today
of
the
violation
by
which
the
french
army
with
the
acquiescence
of
this
country
cross
the
frontier
in
order
to
annihilate
german
industry
and
in
effect
produce
the
present
nazi
party
in
the
house
of
common
in
october
and
again
on
may
amery
systematically
attack
the
use
of
force
to
sustain
the
league
of
nation
on
the
earlier
occasion
he
say
from
the
very
outset
there
have
be
two
school
of
thought
about
the
league
and
about
our
obligation
under
the
league
there
have
be
the
school
to
which
i
belong
and
to
which
for
year
i
believe
the
government
of
this
country
belong
that
regard
the
league
as
a
great
institution
an
organization
for
promote
cooperation
and
harmony
among
the
nation
for
bring
about
understand
a
permanent
round
table
o
the
nation
in
conference
provide
always
that
it
do
not
have
at
the
background
the
threat
of
coercion
there
be
another
school
which
think
that
the
actual
article
of
the
covenant
concoct
in
the
throe
of
the
peace
settlement
and
in
that
atmosphere
of
optimism
which
lead
us
to
expect
ten
million
pound
or
more
in
reparation
from
germany
constitute
a
sacrosanct
dispensation
that
they
have
introduce
a
new
world
order
and
would
if
they
be
only
loyally
adhere
to
abolish
war
for
good
and
all
the
covenant
i
admit
as
originally
draft
embody
both
aspect
and
it
be
because
the
covenant
contain
the
clause
that
stood
for
coercion
and
for
definite
automatic
obligation
that
the
united
state
repudiate
it
from
that
moment
the
keystone
be
take
out
o
the
whole
arch
of
any
league
of
coercion
the
league
be
now
undergo
a
trial
which
may
well
prove
disastrous
to
it
in
this
matter
as
in
other
matter
it
be
the
letter
that
killeth
the
letter
of
the
covenant
be
the
one
thing
which
be
likely
to
kill
the
league
of
nation
amery
then
continued
with
a
brief
resume
o
the
effort
to
make
the
league
an
instrument
of
coercion
especially
the
geneva
protocol
in
regard
to
this
he
continued
the
case
i
wish
to
put
to
the
house
be
that
the
stand
take
by
his
majesty
government
then
and
the
argument
they
use
be
not
argument
merely
against
the
protocol
but
argument
against
the
whole
conception
o
a
league
base
on
economic
and
military
sanction
he
quote
austen
chamberlain
in
and
general
smut
in
with
approval
and
conclude
i
think
that
we
should
have
get
together
with
france
and
italy
and
devise
some
scheme
by
which
under
a
condominium
or
mandate
certain
i
not
all
o
the
non
amharic
province
of
abyssinia
should
be
transfer
to
italian
rule
the
whole
thing
could
have
be
do
by
agreement
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
such
agreement
would
have
be
ratify
at
geneva
this
last
statement
be
more
then
seven
week
before
the
hoare
laval
plan
be
make
public
and
six
week
after
its
outline
be
laid
down
by
hoare
eden
and
laval
at
a
secret
meeting
in
paris
september
in
his
speech
of
may
amery
refer
back
to
his
october
speech
and
demand
that
the
covenant
of
the
league
be
reform
to
prevent
sanction
in
the
future
once
again
he
quote
smuts
speech
of
november
with
approval
and
demand
a
league
which
be
base
not
upon
coercion
but
upon
conciliation
between
amery
s
two
speech
on
february
sir
arthur
salter
of
the
group
and
all
soul
offer
his
argument
to
support
appeasement
he
quote
smut
speech
of
with
approval
and
point
out
the
great
need
for
living
space
and
raw
material
for
japan
italy
and
germany
the
only
solution
he
felt
be
for
britain
to
yield
to
these
need
i
do
not
think
it
matter
he
say
if
you
reintroduce
conscription
and
quadruple
or
quintuple
your
air
force
that
will
not
protect
you
i
believe
that
the
struggle
be
destine
to
come
unless
we
be
prepared
to
agree
to
a
fairer
distribution
of
the
world
land
surface
and
of
the
raw
material
which
be
need
by
modern
civilize
nation
but
there
be
a
way
out
there
be
no
necessity
for
a
clash
i
be
sure
that
time
press
and
that
we
cannot
postpone
a
settlement
indefinitely
i
suggest
that
the
way
out
be
the
application
o
those
principle
of
christianity
the
deliberate
and
conscious
application
of
those
principle
to
international
affair
by
this
nation
and
by
the
world
under
the
leadership
of
this
nation
treat
other
nation
as
you
would
desire
to
be
treat
by
them
the
liquidation
of
the
country
between
germany
and
russia
could
proceed
as
soon
as
the
rhineland
be
fortify
without
fear
on
germany
part
that
france
would
be
able
to
attack
her
in
the
west
while
she
be
occupy
in
the
east
the
chief
task
of
the
milner
group
be
to
see
that
this
devour
process
be
do
no
faster
than
public
opinion
in
britain
could
accept
and
that
the
process
do
not
result
in
any
out
burst
of
violence
which
the
british
people
would
be
unlikely
to
accept
to
this
double
purpose
the
british
government
and
the
milner
group
make
every
effort
to
restrain
the
use
of
force
by
the
german
and
to
soften
up
the
prospective
victim
so
that
they
would
not
resist
the
process
and
thus
precipitate
a
war
the
country
marked
for
liquidation
include
austria
czechoslovakia
and
poland
but
do
not
include
greece
and
turkey
since
the
group
have
no
intention
of
allow
germany
to
get
down
onto
the
mediterranean
lifeline
indeed
the
purpose
o
the
hoare
laval
plan
of
which
wreck
the
collective
security
system
by
seek
to
give
most
of
ethiopia
to
italy
be
intend
to
bring
an
appease
italy
into
position
alongside
england
in
order
to
block
any
movement
of
germany
southward
rather
than
eastward
the
plan
fail
because
mussolini
decide
that
he
could
get
more
out
of
england
by
threat
from
the
side
of
germany
than
from
cooperation
at
the
side
of
england
as
a
result
of
this
fiasco
the
milner
group
lose
another
important
member
arnold
j
toynbee
who
separate
himself
from
the
policy
of

in

courageous
preface
to
the
survey
of

in

a
result
o
the
public
outcry
in
england
hoare
the

from

and
briefly
shelve
in

return
to

follow
may
anthony
eden
who
replace
him
be
not
a
member
of
the
milner
group
and
considerably
more
to
the
public
taste
because
of
his
reputation
largely
undeserved
as
an
upholder
o
collective
security
the
milner
group
be
in
no
wise
hamper
in
its
policy
of
appeasement
by
the
presence
of
eden
in
the
foreign
office
and
the
government
as
a
whole
be
considerably
strengthen
whenever
the
group
want
to
do
something
which
eden
delicate
stomach
could
not
swallow
the
foreign
secretary
go
off
for
a
holiday
and
lord

take
over
his
task
halifax
do
this
for
example
during
the
first
two
week
of
august
when
the
nonintervention
policy
be
establish
in
spain
he
do
it
again
in
february
when

sir
eric
phipps
be
remove
at
ribbentrop

and
replace
by

he
do
it
again
at
the
end
of
october
when
arrangement
be
make
for
his
visit
to
hitler
at
berchtesgaden
in
november
and
finally
halifax
replace
eden
as
foreign
secretary
permanently
in
february
when
eden
refuse
to
accept
the
recognition

it

admit

authorize
biographer
it
be
halifax
as
we
have
see
who
inaugurate
the
nonintervention
policy
in
spain
in
august
and
it
be
halifax
who
open
the
third
and
last
stage
of
appeasement
in
november
by
his
visit
to
hitler
in
berchtesgaden
it
be
probable
that
the
groundwork
for
halifax
visit
to
hitler
have
be
laid
by
the
earlier
visit
of
lord
lothian
and
londonderry
to
the
same
host
but
our
knowledge
of
these
earlier
event
be
too
scanty
to
be
certain
of
halifax
visit
the
story
be
now
clear
as
a
result
of
the
publication
of
the
german
foreign
office
memorandum
on
the
subject
and
keith
feiling
publication
of
some
of
the
letter
from
neville
chamberlain
to
his
sister
the
visit
be
arrange
by
halifax
himself
early
in
november
at
a
time
when
he
be
act
foreign
secretary
eden
be
absent
in
brussels
at
a
meeting
of
signer
of
the
nine
power
pacific
treaty
of
as
a
result
halifax
have
a
long
conversation
with
hitler
on
november
in
which
whatever
may
have
be
halifax
s
intention
hitler
government
become
convince
of
three
thing
a
that
britain
regard
germany
as
the
chief
bulwark
against
communism
in
europe
b
that
britain
be
prepared
to
join
a
four
power
agreement
of
france
germany
italy
and
herself
and
c
that
britain
be
prepared
to
allow
germany
to
liquidate
austria
czechoslovakia
and
poland
if
this
could
be
do
without
provoke
a
war
into
which
the
british
government
however
unwillingly
would
be
drag
in
opposition
to
germany
the
german
foreign
ministry
memorandum
on
this
conversation
make
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
german
do
not
misunderstand
halifax
except
possibly
on
the
last
point
there
they
fail
to
see
that
if
germany
make
war
the
british
government
would
be
force
into
the
war
against
germany
by
public
opinion
in
england
the
german
diplomatic
agent
in
london
especially
the
ambassador
dirksen
saw
this
clearly
but
the
government
in
berlin
listen
only
to
the
blind
and
conceited
ignorance
of
ribbentrop
as
dictator
themselves
unfamiliar
with
the
british
social
or
constitutional
system
the
german
ruler
assume
that
the
willingness
of
the
british
government
to
accept
the
liquidation
of
austria
czechoslovakia
and
poland
imply
that
the
british
government
would
never
go
to
war
to
prevent
this
liquidation
they
do
not
see
that
the
british
government
might
have
to
declare
war
to
stay
in
office
if
public
opinion
in
britain
be
sufficiently
arouse
the
british
government
saw
this
difficulty
and
as
a
last
resort
be
prepared
to
declare
war
but
not
to
wage
war
on
germany
this
distinction
be
not
clear
to
the
german
and
be
not
accepted
by
the
inner
core
of
the
milner
group
it
be
however
accepted
by
the
other
element
in
the
government
like
chamberlain
himself
and
by
much
of
the
second
circle
of
the
milner
group
include
simon
hoare
and
probably
halifax
it
be
this
which
result
in
the
phony
war
from
september
to
april
the
memorandum
on

opinion

english
church
and
the
labour
party
he
and
other
member
of
the
british
government
be
fully
aware
that
the
fiihrer
have
not
only
achieve
a
great
deal
inside
germany
herself
but
that
by
destroy
communism
in
his
country
he
have
bar
its
road
to
western
europe
and
that
germany
therefore
could
rightly
be

as
a
bulwark
of
the
west
against
bolshevism
after

any
of
the

present
unstable
situation

realist
and
be
perhaps
more
than
others

that
the
error
of
the
versailles
dictate
must
be
rectify
britain
always
exercise
her
influence
in
this
realistic
sense
in
the
past

point
to

with
regard
to
the
evacuation
of

rhineland
ahead
of
the
fix
time
the
settlement
of
the

and
the

therefore
want
to
know
the
fiihrer

attitude
toward
the

as
well
as
toward

all
other

in
the

that

so
as
to
avoid
method
which

which

not

either
by

by

all
others
be
at
heart
in

of
the
consolidation
of

that
this
attitude
be
not
halifax
personal
argument
but
the
point
of
view
of
the
government
and
of
the
milner
group
be
perfectly
clear
on
arrival
halifax
assure
the
german
that
the
purpose
o
his
visit
have
be
discuss
and
accepted
by
the
foreign
secretary

the
prime

one
week
after

conversation
with

chamberlain
write
to
his

that
he
hop
to
satisfy
german
colonial
demand
by
give
them
the
belgian
congo
and
angola
in
place
o
tanganyika
he
then
add
i
do
not
see
why
we
should
not
say
to
germany
give
us
satisfactory
assurance
that
you
wo
not
use
force
to
deal
with
the
austrian
and
czechoslovakian
and
we
will
give
you
similar
assurance
that
we
wo
not
use
force
to
prevent
the
change
you
want
if
you
can
get
them
by
peaceful
mean
it
might
be
note
that
when
john
w
wheeler
bennett
of
chatham
house
and
the
milner
group
write
his
book
on
munich
prologue
to

publish
in
he
relegate
the
last
quotation
to
a
footnote
and
suppress
the
reference
to
the
belgian
congo
and
angola
this
however
be
an
essential
part
of
the
appeasement
program
of
the
chamberlain
group
on
march
the
british
ambassador
in
berlin

henderson
one
of
the
chamberlain
group
try
to
persuade
hitler
to
begin
negotiation
to
carry
out
this
plan
but
do
not
succeed
he
repeat
lord
halifax
statement
that
change
in
europe
be
acceptable
to
britain
if
accomplish
without
the
free
play
o
force
and
state
that
he
personally
have
often
express
himself
in
favour
of
the
anschluss
in
the
colonial
field
he
try

interest
hitler
in
an
area
in
africa
between
the
th
parallel
and
the

the

that
his
interest
be
restrict
to
restoration
of
germany
colony
in
africa
at
the
famous
interview
between
hitler
and
schuschnigg
in
february
hitler
told
the
austrian
that
lord
halifax
agree
with
everything
he
hitler
do
with
respect
to
austria
and
the
sudeten
german
this
be
report
in
a
rush
and
strictly
confidential
message
of
february
from
the

a
document

to
the
american
press
on
december
chamberlain
and
others
make
it
perfectly
clear
both
in
public
and
in
private
that
britain
would
not
act
to
prevent
german
occupation
of
austria
or
czechoslovakia
on
february
during
the
austrian
crisis
john
simon
say
in
the
house
of
common
great
britain
have
never
give
special
guarantee
regard
austrian
independence
six
day
later
chamberlain
say
we
must
not
try
to
delude
small
nation
into
think
that
they
will
be
protect
by
the
league
against
aggression
and
act
accordingly
when
we
know
that
nothing
of
the
kind
can
be
expect
five
day
after
the
seizure
of
austria
on
march
the
soviet
union
sent
britain
a
proposal
for
an
international
conference
to
stop
aggression
the
suggestion
be
reject
at
once
and
on
march
chamberlain
write
to
his
sister
i
have
therefore
abandon
any
idea
of
give
guarantee
to
czechoslovakia
or
to
the
french
in
connection
with
her
obligation
to
that
country
when
daladier
the
french
premier
come
to
london
at
the
end
o
april
to
seek
support
for
czechoslovakia
chamberlain
refuse
and
apparently
i
we
can
believe
feiling
put
pressure
on
the
french
to
compel
the
czechoslovak
to
make
an
agreement
with
hitler
on
may
chamberlain
write
to
his

in
this
connection
fortunately
the
paper
have
have
no
hint
of
how
near
we
come
to
a
break
over

have
come

to

great
emphasis
to
those
who
now
feel
that
it
be
a
mistake
to
have
deprive
germany
of
all
her
colony
in
and
that
great
britain
should
contribute
her
share
towards
find
a
colonial
area
say
in
central
west
africa
which
could
be
transfer
to
germany
under
mandate
but
they
too
make
it
a
condition
that
colonial
revision
should
be
part
of
a
final
all
round
settlement
with
germany
and
that
the
colony
should
not
be
use
as
leverage
for
fresh
demand
or
as
strategic
base
later
it
say
a
majority
would
regard
the
abandonment
of
france
eastern
alliance
as
a
price
well
worth
pay
for
last
peace
and
the
return
of
germany
to
the
league
it
welcome
german
rearmament
since
this
would
force
revision
of
the
evil
treaty
of
versailles
in
this
connection
the
same
article
say
the
pressure
of
rearmament
and
the
event
of
the
last
few
year
have
at
least
have
this
effect
that
the
refusal
of
those
who
have
benefit
most
by
the
peace
settlement
to
consider
any
kind
of
change
be
rapidly
disappear
for
forcible
change
which
they
have
be
unable
to
prevent
have
already
take
place
and
far
change
will
certainly
follow
especially
in
eastern
europe
unless
they
be
prepared
to
fight
a
very
formidable
war
to
prevent
them
the
article
reject
such
a
war
on
the
ground
that
its
outcome
be
uncertain
and
it
would
entail
objectionable
domestic
disaster
m
in
add
up
the
balance
o
military
force
in
such
a

the
article
significantly
omit
all
mention
of
czechoslovakia
whose
force
at
that
time
be
considerably
strong

it

the

of

the
round

speak
for
the

circle
of
the
milner
group
be
not
nearly
so
anti
russian
as
the

accordingly
it
never

a
collision
between
nazi
germany
and
the
soviet

as
a
practical
solution
of

it
do
accept
the
idea
o
a

from

but
it
be
not
willing
to

to

as
she
wish
the
milner

misunderstand
of
the

of

itself

so
great

the

on
rapid
british
rearmament
and
the
building
up
of
the
oceanic
system
because
they
have
a
low
opinion
o
britain
own
power
than
do
the
chamberlain

this
idea
be
derive
from

they
be
not
prepared
to

germany
to
go
eastward
indefinitely
in
the
hope
she
would
be
satisfied
by
a
war
with
russia
as
we
shall
see
the
policy
of
the
milner
group
and
the
chamberlain
group
go
jointly
forward
with
slight
shift
o
emphasis
until
march
when
the

begin
to
disintegrate
in
the

article
of
december
the
round

that
the

must
make
clear
the
point
at
which
they
be
prepared
to
risk
war
rather
than
retreat
during
the
last
year
or
two
the
round
table
have
criticize
the
popular
dogma
of
collective
security
on
two
main
ground
that
it
meant
fight
to
maintain
an
out
of

settlement
and
that
security
depend
not
merely
on
public
opinion
but
on
ability
to
bring
effective
military
superiority
to
bear
at
the
critical
point
on
the
other
hand
the
round
table
be
resolutely
in
favour
of
adequate
defensive
armament
and
of
a
vigorous
and
if
necessary
defiant
foreign
policy
at
those
point
where
we
be
sure
that
we
can
bring
superior
power
effectively
to
bear
and
for
this
purpose
we
consider
that
the
nation
of
the
commonwealth
should
not
only
act
together
themselves
but
should
also
work
in
the
closest
cooperation
with
all
the

spoke
in

house
o
lord
in
support
of

this
extraordinary
speech
be
deliver
in
defense
of
the
retire
of
sir
robert
vansittart
sir
robert
as
permanent
under
secretary
in
the
foreign
office
from
to
be
a
constant
thorn
in
the
side
of
the
appeaser
the
opening
of
the
third
stage
o
appeasement
at
the
end
of
make
it
necessary
to
get
rid
of
him
and
his
objection
to
their
policy
accordingly
he
be
promote
to
the
newly
create
post
o
chief
diplomatic
adviser
and
the
under
secretaryship
be
give
to
sir
alexander
cadogan
of
the
cecil
bloc
this
action
lead
to
a
debate
in
february
lord
lothian
intervene
to
insist
that
sir
robert
new
role
would
not
be
parallel
to
that
of
the
new
under
secretary
but
be
restrict
to
advise
only
on
matter
specifically
refer
to
him
by
the
secretary
o
state
and
he
be
no
longer
responsible
for
the
day
to
day
work
of
the
office
from
this
point
lothian
launch
into
a
long
attack
on
the
league
of
nation
follow
by
a
defense
of
germany
in
regard
to
the
former
he
express
satisfaction
that
the
most
dangerous
aspect
of
the
league
of
nation
namely
the
interpretation
which
have
habitually
be
put
upon
it
by
the
league
of
nation
union
in
this
country
be
pretty
well
dead
it
seem
to
me
that
that
interpretation
be
inevitably
go
to
turn
the
league
of
nation
itself
not
into
an
instrument
for
maintain
peace
but
into
an
instrument
for
make
war
that
be
not
the
original
concept
of
the
league
at
all
the
original
concept
of
the
league
definitely
left
the
way
open
for
alteration
after
six
month
examination
even
if
it
meant
war
i
think
the
league
o
nation
now
at
last
be
go
to
have
a
chance
of
recovery
for
the
reason
that
this
particular
interpretation
which
have
be
its
besetting
sin
the
one
thing
which
have
lead
to
its
failure
from
the
begin
be
now
dead
therefore
i
be
more
hopeful
of
the
league
today
than
i
have
be
for
a
good
long
time
because
it
have
cease
to
be
an
instrument
to
try
to
perpetuate
the
status
quo
when
lothian
turn
to
the
problem
of
germany
his
argument
become
even
more
ridiculous
the
fundamental
problem
of
the
world
today
be
still
the
problem
of
germany
why
be
germany
the
issue
in
my
view
the
fundamental
reason
be
that
at
no
time
in
the
year
after
have
the
rest
o
the
world
be
willing
to
concede
any
substantial
justice
or
reasonable
understand
to
germany
either
when
she
be
a
republic
or
since
she
have
become
a
totalitarian
state
there
follow
a
long
attack
on
the
war
guilt
thesis
as
apply
to
or
even
to
this
thesis
lothian
call
propaganda
and
from
this
false
propaganda
he
trace
all
the
cruel
treatment
give
germany
since
he
disapprove
of
the
nazi
government
method
inside
germany
but
add
i
do
not
think
there
be
any
doubt
that
modern
germany
be
the
result
of
the
policy
o
the
united
state
whom
i
cannot
absolve
from
responsibility
of
ourselves
and
of
france
and
in
this
matter
the
responsibility
of
the
united
state
and
ourselves
be
more
than
that
o
france
for
default
on
the
obligation
to
give
france
some
security
so
that
she
could
allow
germany
to
recover
it
seem
impossible
that
this
could
be
the
same
man
who
be
call
for
the
extirpation
of
prussianism
in
and
who
be
to
call
for
the
same
crusade
as
ambassador
in
washington
in
in
this
same
speech
lothian
laid
down
what
might
be
call
the
milner
group
solution
to
this
german
problem
model
there
be
only
one
solution
to
this
problem
you
have
get
to
combine
collective
justice
with
collective
security
you
have
get
to
give
remedy
to
those
nation
which
be
entitle
to
them
you
have
get
to
be
willing
to
concede
to
them
and
one
o
them
be
germany
alteration
in
the
status
quo
and
you
have
also
get
to
incur
obligation
with
other
like
mind
nation
to
resist
change
which
go
beyond
what
impartial
justice
regard
as
fair
when
we
be
willing
to
admit
that
we
be
ourselves
largely
responsible
for
the
tragedy
that
confronts
us
for
the
fact
that
germany
be
the
center
of
the
world
problem
and
be
willing
to
concede
to
germany
what
a
fair
mind
and
impartial
authority
would
say
be
a
fair
solution
of
her
problem
and
if
in
addition
to
that
we
be
willing
to
say
we
will
meet
aggression
to
secure
more
than
this
with
the
only
mean
in
which
it
can
be
met
then
i
consider
there
be
hope
for
the
world
the
fallacy
in
all
of
this
rest
on
the
fact
that
every
concession
to
germany
make
her
strong
with
no
guarantee
that
she
ever
would
stop
and
i
after
year
of
concession
she
refuse
to
stop
she
might
be
too
strong
to
be
compel
to
do
so
the
milner
group
thesis
be
base
not
only
on
ignorance
but
also
on
logical
deficiency
the
program
of
the
chamberlain
group
be
at
least
more
consistent
since
it
involve
no
effort
to
stop
germany
at
any
point
but
aim
to
solve
the
german
problem
by
drive
it
into
russia
such
an
immoral
solution
could
not
be
acceptable
to
the
milner
group
so
they
should
have
have
sense
enough
to
stop
germany
while
she
be
weak
shortly
after
this
speech
on
february
lothian
intervene
in
the
debate
on
eden
s
resignation
to
reject
eden
point
of
view
and
defend
chamberlain
he
reject
the
idea
that
britain
should
commit
herself
to
support
czechoslovakia
against
germany
and
criticize
the
president
of
czechoslovakia
for
his
failure
to
make
concession
to
republican
germany
he
then
repeat
his
speech
of
the
week
before
the
chief
addition
be
a
defense
of
the
german
remilitarization
of
the
rhineland
in
march
four
day
after
the
seizure
of
austria
lothian
again
advise
against
any
new
pledge
to
anyone
and
demand
rearmament
and
national
service
in
regard
to
rearmament
he
say
unpreparedness
and
the
belief
that
you
be
unwilling
to
accept
that
challenge
or
that
you
do
not
mean
what
you
say
do
contribute
to
war
that
will
remain
to
be
a
condition
of
the
world
until
the
nation
be
willing
in
some
way
to
pool
their
sovereignty
in
a
common
federation
all
o
these
idea
of
lothian
be
explictly
restate
by
him
in
a
speech
at
chatham
house
on
march
he
refute
the
war
guilt
thesis
condemn
the
versailles
settlement
as
a
very
stiff
peace
treaty
insist
on
revision
blame
all
the
disaster
of
europe
on
america
s
withdrawal
from
the
league
in
call
the
hitler
government
a
temporary
unnatural
pathological
state
solely
cause
by
the
stiff
treaty
and
the
failure
to
revise
it
defend
the
remilitarization
of
the
rhineland
and
the
seizure
of
austria
condemn
czechoslovakia
as
almost
the
only
racially
heterogeneous
state
left
in
europe
praise
nonintervention
in
spain
praise
chamberlain
s
statement
of
the
same
day
refuse
to
promise
support
to
czechoslovakia
and
demand
national
service
as
insurance
that
hitler
would
not
continue
to
use
force
after
he
obtain
what
he
deserve
in
justice
these
argument
of
lothian
be
all
support
by
the
group
in
other
way
the
round
table
in
its
lead
article
of
march
september
and
march
demand
national
service
in
the
lead
article
of
june
it
repeat
all
lothian
argument
in
somewhat
different
word
these
argument
could
be
sum
up
in
the
slogan
appeasement
and
rearmament
then
it
add
until
the
nation
can
be
brought
to
the
two
principle
of
collective
security
already
described
the
best
security
for
peace
be
that
the
world
should
be
divide
into
zone
within
each
of
which
one
of
the
great
arm
power
or
a
group
of
them
be
clearly
preponderant
and
in
which
therefore
other
power
do
not
seek
to
interfere
then
there
may
be
peace
for
a
time
the
peace
o
the
th
century
rest
on
the
fact
that
the
supremacy
of
the
british
navy
kept
the
whole
oceanic
area
free
from
general
war
the
vital
question
now
arises
whether
in
that
same
zone
to
which
france
and
scandinavia
must
be
add
it
be
not
possible
despite
the
immense
armament
of
central
europe
russia
and
the
far
east
for
the
democracy
to
create
security
stability
and
peace
in
which
liberal
institution
can
survive
the
oceanic
zone
in
fact
constitutes
the
one
part
of
the
world
in
which
it
be
possible
today
to
realise
the
ideal
of
the
league
of
nation
from
this
point
onward
early
the
milner
group
increasingly
emphasize
the
necessity
for
building
up
this
oceanic
bloc
in
england
the
basic
propaganda
work
be
do
through
the
round
table
and
lionel
curtis
while
in
the
united
state
it
be
do
through
the
rhodes
scholarship
organization
especially
through
clarence
streit
and
frank
aydelotte
in
england
curtis
write
a
series
of
book
and
article
advocate
a
new
federal
organization
built
around
the
english
speak
country
the
chief
work
o
this
nature
be
his
civitas
dei
which
appear
in
three
volume
in
a
one
volume
edition
be
issue
in
with
the
title
the
commonwealth
oj
god
the
first
two
volume
o
this
work
be
nothing
more
than
a
rehash
and
expansion
of
the
old
work
the
commonwealth
of
nation
by
a
superficial
and
frequently
erroneous
rewrite
of
world
history
the
author
sought
to
review
the
evolution
o
the
com
monwealth
idea
and
to
show
that
all
of
history
lead
to
its
fulfillment
and
achievement
in
federation
ultimately
this
federation
will
be
worldwide
but
en
route
it
must
pas
through
stage
of
which
the
chief
be
federation
of
the
english
speak
people
write
early
in
he
advocate
that
the
league
of
nation
be
destroyed
by
the
mass
resignation
of
the
british
democracy
these
should
then
take
the
initiative
in
form
a
new
league
also
at
geneva
which
would
have
no
power
to
enforce
anything
but
would
merely
form
a
kind
of
international
conference
since
it
would
be
foolish
to
expect
any
federation
to
evolve
from
any
such
organization
as
this
a
parallel
but
quite
separate
effort
should
be
make
to
create
an
international
commonwealth
base
on
the
example
of
the
united
state
in
this
international
commonwealth
would
differ
from
the
league
of
nation
in
that
its
member
would
yield
up
part
of
their
sovereignty
and
the
central
organization
would
function
directly
on
individual
and
not
merely
on
state
this
international
commonwealth
would
be
form
at
first
only
o
those
state
that
have
evolve
furthest
in
the
direction
of
obtain
a
commonwealth
form
of
government
for
themselves
it
will
be
recall
that
this
restriction
on
membership
be
what
curtis
have
originally
advocate
for
the
league
of
nation
in
the
round
table
of
december
accord
to
curtis
the
movement
toward
the
commonwealth
o
god
can
begin
by
the
union
o
any
two
national
commonwealth
no
matter
how
small
he
suggest
new
zealand
and
australia
or
these
two
and
great
britain
then
the
international
commonwealth
could
be
expand
to
include
india
egypt
holland
belgium
scandinavia
france
canada
the
united
state
and
ireland
that
the
chief
obstacle
to
this
union
be
to
be
found
in
men
mind
be
perfectly
clear
to
curtis
to
overcome
this
obstacle
he
put
his
faith
in
propaganda
and
the
chief
instrument
of
that
propaganda
he
say
must
be
the
church
and
the
university
he
say
nothing
about
the
milner
group
but
consider
curtis
position
in
this
group
and
that
lothian
and
others
agree
with
him
it
be
not
surprising
that
the
chief
source
of
this
propaganda
be
to
be
found
in
those
agency
control
by
the
group
in
the
united
state
the
chief
source
of
this
propaganda
be
the
organization
know
as
union
now
which
be
an
offshoot
of
the

one
of
the
great
merit
of
mr

book
that
he
translates
the
general
theme
into
a
concrete
plan
which
he
present
not

the
detail
do
not
concern
us
here
but
it
should
be
mention
that
the
dispute
arose
over
the
position
of
the
sudeten
german
within
the
czechoslovak
state
and
as
late
as

still
be
express
in

up
to
that
day
hitler
have
make
no
demand
to
annex
the
sudeten

although
on
september
he
have
for
the
first
time
ask
for
selfdetermination
for
the
sudetens
konrad

and

of
the

german
express
no
desire
to
go
back
to
the

until
after
september
who
then
first
demand
frontier
rectification
in
favor
of
germany
chamberlain
do
so
privately
on
may
and
the
milner
group
do
so
publicly
on
september
the
chamberlain
suggestion
be
make
by
one
of
those
calculate
indiscretion
of
which
he
be
so
fond
at
an
off
the
record
meeting
with
certain
canadian
and
american
newspaper
reporter
at
a
luncheon
arrange
by
lady
astor
and
held
at
her
london
house
on
this
occasion
chamberlain
spoke
of
his
plan
for
a
four
power
pact
to
exclude
russia
from
europe
and
the
possibility
of
frontier
revision
in
favor
of
germany
to
settle
the
sudeten
issue
when
the
news
leak
out
as
it
be
bound
to
do
chamberlain
be
question
in
common
by
geoffrey
mander
on
june
but
refuse
to
answer
call
his
questioner
a
troublemaker
this
answer
be
criticize
by
sir
archibald
sinclair
the
follow
day
but
he
receive
no
well
treatment
lady
astor
however
interject
i
would
like
to
say
that
there
be
not
a
word
of
truth
in
it
by
june
however
she
have
a
change
of
heart
and
state
i
never
have
any
inten
tion
of
deny
that
the
prime
minister
have
attend
a
luncheon
at
my
house
the
prime
minister
do
so
attend
the
object
be
to
enable
some
american
journalist
who
have
not
previously
met
him
to
do
so
privately
and
informally
and
thus
to
make
his
acquaintance
the
second
suggestion
for
revision
of
frontier
also
have
an
astor
flavor
since
it
appear
as
a
lead
article
in
the
time
on
september
the
outrage
cry
of
protest
from
all
side
which
greet
this
suggestion
make
it
clear
that
far
soften
up
of
the
british
public
be
urgently
necessary
before
it
would
be
safe
to
hand
over
czechoslovakia
to
hitler
this
be
do
in
the
war
scare
of
september
in
london
that
this
war
scare
be
fraudulent
and
that
lord
halifax
be
deeply
involve
in
its
creation
be
now
clear
all
the
evidence
cannot
be
give
here
there
be
no
evidence
whatever
that
the
chamberlain
government
intend
to
fight
over
czechoslovakia
unless
this
be
the
only
alternative
to
fall
from
office
even
at
the
height
of
the
crisis
when
all
way
out
without
war
seem
close
september
chamberlain
show
what
he
thought
of
the
case
by
tell
the
british
people
over
the
bbc
that
the
issue
be
a
quarrel
in
a
far
away
country
between
people
of
whom
we
know
nothing
to
frighten
the
british
people
the
british
government
circulate
story
about
the
strength
of
the
german
army
and
air
force
which
be
greatly
exaggerated
they
imply
that
germany
would
use
poison
gas
at
once
and
from
the
air
although
this
be
quite
untrue
they
distribute
gas
mask
and
madly
built
trench
in
london
park
although
the
former
be
needle
and
the
latter
worthless
on
september
the
british
advise
the
czechoslovakian
government
to
mobilize
although
they
have
previously
forbidden
it
this
be
do
to
increase
the
crisis
in
london
and
the
fact
that
goring
air
force
allow
it
to
go
through
without
attack
indicates
his
belief
that
germany
do
not
need
to
fight
in
fact
gore
told
the
french
ambassador
on
september
that
he
have
positive
assurance
that
britain
would
not
fight
as
early
as
september
sir
horace
wilson
chamberlain
alter
ego
told
the
german
charge
d
affaire
in
london
theodor
kordt
if
we
two
great
britain
and
germany
come
to
agreement
regard
the
settlement
of
the
czech
problem
we
shall
simply
brush
aside
the
resistance
that
france
or
czechoslovakia
herself
may
offer
to
the
decision
the
fraudulent
nature
of
the
munich
crisis
appear
throughout
its
history
we
might
mention
the
follow
the
suspicious
fashion
in
which
the
runciman
mission
be
sent
to
czechoslovakia
immediately
after
hitler
aide
captain
wiedemann
visit
halifax
at
the
latter
s
home
not
the
foreign
office
on
july
and
with
the
statement
which
be
untrue
that
it
be
be
sent
at
the
desire
of
the
czechoslovak
the
fact
that
runciman
in
czechoslovakia
spent
most
of
his
time
with
the
sudetens
and
put
pressure
on
the
government
to
make
one
concession
after
another
to
henlein
when
it
be
perfectly
clear
that
henlein
do
not
want
a
settlement
the
fact
that
runciman
write
to
hitler
on
september
that
he
would
have
a
plan
for
a
settlement
by
september
the
fact
that
this
runciman
plan
be
practically
the
same
as
the
munich
settlement
finally
adopt
the
fact
that
chamberlain
make
the
war
scare
over
the
godesberg
proposal
and
after
make
a
settlement
at
munich
make
no
effort
to
enforce
those
provision
by
which
munich
differ
from
godesberg
but
on
the
contrary
allow
the
german
to
take
what
they
wish
in
czechoslovakia
as
they
wish
the
fact
that
the
government
do
all
it
could
to
exclude
russia
from
the
settlement
although
russia
be
allied
to
both
czechoslovakia
and
france
the
fact
that
the
government
and
the
french
government
try
to
spread
the
belief
that
russia
would
not
honor
these
commitment
although
all
the
evidence
indicate
that
she
would
the
fact
that
chamberlain
have
a
tete
a
tete
conference
with
hitler
at
berchtesgaden
on
september
which
last
for
three
hour
and
at
which
only
hitler
s

cmd
two
additional
point
concerned
with
the
degree
of
german
armament
and
the
position
of
the
anti
hitler
resistance
within
germany
require
far
elucidation
for
year
before
june
the
government
have
insist
that
british
rearm
be
progress
in
a
satisfactory
fashion
churchill
and
others
have
question
this
and
have
produce
figure
on
german
rearmament
to
prove
that
britain
own
progress
in
this
field
be
inadequate
these
figure
be
deny
by
the
government
and
their
own
accomplishment
be
defend
in
and
in
churchill
have
clashed
with
baldwin
and
chamberlain
on
this
issue
as
late
as
march
chamberlain
say
that
british
armament
be
such
as
to
make
her
an
almost
terrify
power
on
the
opinion
of
the
world
but
as
the
year
go
on
the
government
adopt
a
quite
different
attitude
in
order
to
persuade
public
opinion
that
it
be
necessary
to
yield
to
germany
the
government
pretend
that
its
armament
be
quite
inadequate
in
comparison
with
germany
we
now
know
thanks
to
the
capture
paper
of
the
german
ministry
of
war
that
this
be
a
gross
exaggeration
these
paper
be
study
by
major
general
c
f
robinson
of
the
united
state
army
and
analyze
in
a
report
which
he
submit
to
the
secretary
of
war
in
october
this
document
entitle
foreign
logistical
organiza
tions
and
method
show
that
all
of
the
accepted
estimate
of
german
rearmament
in
the
period
be
gross
exaggeration
from
to
the
outbreak
of
war
german
aircraft
production
be
not
raise
but
average
plane
a
month
her
tank
production
be
low
and
even
in
be
less
than
britain
s
in
the
first
month
of
germany
produce
only
tank
a
month
in
the
last
month
of
in
wartime
germany
produce
tank
and
self
propel
gun
compare
to
a
british
production
of
tank
in
the
same
period
at
the
time
of
the
munich
crisis
germany
have
infantry
and
motorize
division
none
of
them
fully
man
or
equip
this
be
no
more
than
czechoslovakia
have
alone
moreover
the
czech
army
be
well
train
have
far
well
equipment
and
have
well
morale
and
well
fortification
as
an
example
of
this
point
we
might
mention
that
the
czech
tank
be
of
ton
while
the
german
before
have
no
tank
over
ton
during
they
brought
into
production
the
mark
iii
tank
of
less
than
ton
and
in
brought
into
production
the
mark
iv
o
ton
up
to
september
the
german
army
have
obtain
only
tank
of
the
mark
iii
and
mark
iv
type
together
most
of
these
be
deliver
during
in
comparison
the
german
capture
in
czechoslovakia
in
march
of
the
superior
czech
tank
at
the
same
time
they
capture
plane
of
which
be
first
line
machineguns
and
over
million
rifle
these
figure
be
comparable
with
what
germany
have
at
munich
and
at
that
time
if
the
british
government
have
desire
germany
would
have
be
face
france
britain
and
russia
as
well
as
czechoslovakia
it
should
perhaps
be
mention
that
up
to
september
the
german
navy
have
acquire
only
submarine
during
the
hitler
regime
no
economic
mobilization
for
war
have
be
make
and
no
reserve
stock
built
up
when
the
war
begin
in
september
germany
have
ammunition
for
week
and
the
air
force
have
bomb
for
month
at
the
rate
of
expenditure
experienced
during
the
polish
campaign
at
that
time
the
air
force
consist
of
bomber
and
fighter
in
contrast
the
british
air
program
of
may
plan
to
provide
britain
with
a
first
line
force
o
plane
this
program
be
step
up
in
under
it
britain
produce
almost
military
plane
in
and
about
in
the
german
figure
for
plane
produce
in
these
year
be
and
but
these
be
figure
for
all
plane
produce
in
the
country
include
civil
as
well
as
military
airplane
as
hanson
baldwin
put
it
up
until
at
least
germany
production
do
not
markedly
outstrip
britain
it
might
also
be
mention
that
british
combat
plane
be
of
well
quality
we
have
no
way
of
know
if
the
chamberlain
government
knew
these
fact
it
should
have
know
them
at
the
least
it
should
not
have
deluge
its
own
people
with
untrue
story
about
german
arm
surprisingly
the
british
have
generally
refuse
to
modify
these
story
and
in
order
to
perpetuate
the
fable
about
the
necessity
for
the
munich
surrender
they
have
continued
to
repeat
the
untrue
propaganda
story
of
regard
german
armament
this
be
as
true
of
the
critic
of
munich
as
of
its
defender
both
have
adopt
the
version
that
britain
yield
to
superior
and
overwhelm
force
at
munich
they
have
do
this
even
though
this
story
be
untrue
and
they
be
in
a
position
to
know
that
it
be
untrue
for
example
winston
churchill
in
his
war
memoir
repeat
the
old
story
about
german
rearmament
although
he
have
be
write
two
year
or
more
after
the
reichswehr
archive
be
capture
for
this
he
be
criticize
by
hanson
baldwin
in
the
neto
york
time
of
may
in
his
recent
book
munich
prologue
to
tragedy
j
w
wheeler
bennett
the
british
editor
of
the
capture
paper
of
the
german
foreign
ministry
accepts
the
old
propaganda
tale
of
german
rearmament
as
axiomatic
and
accordingly
do
not
even
discus
the
subject
he
merely
tell
his
reader
by
the
close
of
germany
preparedness
for
war
be
complete
the
preference
for
gun
rather
than
for
butter
have
brought
forth
result
her
rearmament
have
reach
its
apogee
and
could
hold
that
peak
level
for
a
certain
time
her
economy
be
gear
to
a
strict
regime
of
ration
and
output
on
a
war
level
none
of
this
be
true
and
mr
wheeler
bennett
should
have
examine
the
evidence
if
he
have
he
would
not
have
be
so
severe
on
what
he
call
professor
frederick
schumann
s
fantastic
theory
of
the
pre
munich
plot
the
last
piece
of
evidence
which
we
might
mention
to
support
the
theory
not
of
a
plot
perhaps
but
that
the
munich
surrender
be
unnecessary
and
take
place
because
chamberlain
and
his
associate
want
to
dismember
czechoslovakia
be
even
more
incriminate
as
a
result
of
the
inadequate
rearmament
of
germany
a
group

this

to

adam

who

after

remain
in

with
the

until
arrest
and
execute
by
the

in
it
be
not
without
significance
that
one
of
the
chief
project
which
the
plotter
hop
to
far
in
post
hitler
german
foreign
policy
be
a
federation
of
europe
in
a
commonwealth
not
unlike
the
british
empire
all
of
this
evidence
and
much
more
would
seem
to
support
the
theory
o
a
munich
plot
that
be
the
theory
that
the
british
government
have
no
intention
or
desire
to
save
czechoslovakia
in
and
be
willing
or
even
eager
to
see
it
partition
by
hitler
and
only
stag
the
war
scare
of
september
in
order
to
make
the
british
people
accept
this
abuse
of
honor
and
sacrifice
of
britain
international
position
the
effort
which
the
british
government
make
after
munich
to
conceal
the
fact
of
that
affair
would
support
this
interpretation
the
chief
question
from
our
point
of
view
lie
in
the
degree
to
which
the
milner
group
be
involve
in
this
plot
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
chamberlain
group
be
the
chief
factor
in
the
scheme
there
be
also
no
doubt
that
various
member
of
the
milner
group
second
circle
who
be
close
to
the
chamberlain
group
be
involve
the
position
o
the
inner
core
of
the
milner
group
be
not
conclusively
establish
but
there
be
no
evidence
that
they
be
not
involve
and
a
certain
amount
of
evidence
that
they
be
involve
among
this
latter
evidence
be
the
fact
that
the
inner
core
of
the
group
do
not
object
to
or
protest
against
the
partition
of
czechoslovakia
although
they
do
use
the
method
by
which
hitler
have
obtain
his
goal
as
an
argument
in
support
of
their
pet
plan
for
national
service
they
prepared
the
ground
for
the
munich
surrender
both
in
the
time
and
in
the
round
table
in
the
june
issue
o
the
latter
we
read
czechoslovakia
be
apparently
the
danger
spot
o
the
next
few
month
it
will
require
high
statesmanship
on
all
side
to
find
a
peaceful
and
stable
solution
o
the
minority
problem
the
critical
question
for
the
next
six
month
be
whether
the
four
great
power
represent
by
the
franco
british
entente
and
the
rome
berlin
axis
can
make
up
their
mind
that
they
will
not
go
to
war
with
one
another
and
that
they
must
settle
outstanding
problem
by
agreement
together
in
this
statement
three
implication
be
o
almost
equal
importance
these
be
the
time
limit
of
six
month
the
exclusion
of
both
czechoslovakia
and
russia
from
the
agreement
and
the
approval
of
the
four

pact
in
the
september
issue
of
the
round
table
publish
on
the
eve
of
munich
we
be
told
it
be
one
thing
to
be
able
in
the
end
to
win
a
war
it
be
a
far
well
thing
to
be
able
to
prevent
a
war
by
a
readiness
for
just
deal
combine
with
resolute
strength
when
injustice
be
threaten
here
as
always
before
the
round
table
by
justice
meant
appeasement
o
germany
after
the
dreadful
deed
be
do
the
round
table
have
not
a
word
of
regret
and
hardly
a
kind
word
for
the
great
sacrifice
of
the
czech
or
for
the
magnificent
demonstration
of
restraint
which
they
have
give
the
world
in
fact
the
lead
article
in
the
december
issue
of
the
round
table
begin
with
a
severe
criticism
of
czechoslovakia
for
failure
to
reconcile
her
minority
for
failure
to
achieve
economic
cooperation
with
her
neighbor
and
for
failure
to
welcome
a
hapsburg
restoration
from
that
point
on
the
article
be
honest
while
accept
munich
it
regard
it
solely
as
a
surrender
to
german
power
and
reject
the
argument
that
it
be
do
by
negotiation
that
it
be
a
question
o
self
determination
or
minority
right
or
that
munich
be
any
well
or
more
lenient
than
the
godesberg
demand
the
follow
article
in
the
same
issue
also
on
czechoslovakia
be
a
tissue
of
untruth
except
for
the
statement
that
there
never
be
any
real
sudeten
issue
since
the
whole
thing
be
a
fraudulent
creation
engineer
from
germany
otherwise
the
article
declares
categorically
that
czechoslovakia
could
not
have
stood
up
against
hitler
more
than
two
or
three
week
that
no
opposition
of
importance
to
hitler
exist
in
germany
a
good
deal
have
be
write
about
the
opposition
o
the
military
commander
but
in
fact
it
do
not
and
never
do
exist
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
conservative
opposition
in
germany
in
the
middle
of
such
statement
as
these
one
ray
of
sanity
shine
like
a
light
in
a
single
sentence
the
round
table
toss
onto
the
scrap
heap
its
basic
argument
in
support
of
appeasement
namely
the
injustice
of
versailles
the
sentence
read
it
be
not
versailles
but
defeat
that
be
the
essential
german
grievance
against
the
western
power
m
this
sentence
should
have
be
print
in
gold
letter
in
the
foreign
office
in
london
in
and
read
daily
thereafter
it
be
worthy
of
note
that
this
issue
o
the
round
table
discuss
the
czech
crisis
in
two
article
of
twenty
seven
page
and
have
only
one
sentence
on
russia
this
sentence
spoke
of
the
weakness
of
russia
where
a
new
tiberius
have
destroyed
the
morale
and
the
material
efficiency
of
the
russian
army
however
in
a
separate
article
deal
largely
with
soviet
german
relation
we
find
the
significant
sentence
the
western
democracy
appear
to
be
frame
their
policy
on
the
principle
of
let
germany
go
east
russia
face
the
fundamental
need
of
prevent
a
hostile
coalition
of
the
great
power
of
western
europe
the
final
judgment
of
the
milner
group
on
the
munich
surrender
could
probably
be
found
in
the
december
issue
of
the
round
table
where
we
read
the
follow
the
nation
as
a
whole
be
acutely
aware
that
anglo
french
predominance
result
from
victory
in
the
great
war
be
now
a
matter
of
history
that
the
conception
o
an
international
society
have
founder
because
the
principle
of
the
rule
of
law
be
prostitute
to
perpetuate
an
impossible
inequality
the
term
o
the
versailles
treaty
might
have
be
upheld
for
some
time
longer
by
the
consistent
use
of
military
power
notably
when
germany
remilitarize
the
rhineland
zone
but
it
be
illogical
to
expect
a
defeat
and
humiliate
foe
to
accept
inferiority
as
the
immutable
concomitant
of
a
nobler
world
and
it
be
immoral
to
try
to
build
the
city
of
god
on
lopsided
foundation
as
late
as
the
march
issue
the
round
table
point
of
view
remain
unchanged
at
that
time
it
say
the
policy
of
appeasement
which
mr
chamberlain
represent
and
which
he
brought
to
what
seem
to
be
its
most
triumphant
moment
at
munich
be
the
only
possible
policy
on
which
the
public
opinion
of
the
different
nation
of
the
commonwealth
could
have
be
unified
it
have
already
be
unanimously

in
general
term
at
the
imperial
conference
o
the
german
occupation
of
bohemia
and
moravia
in
march
marked
the
turn
point
for
the
milner
group
but
not
for
the
chamberlain
group
in
the
june
issue
the
lead
article
of
the
round

be

without

about
the

which
it

it

it
say

soviet
russia
in
the
system
be
continue
most
of
the
article
justified
the
previous
policy
as
inevitable
in
a
world
of
sovereign
state
until
federation
abolishes
sovereignty
and
creates
a
true
world
government
amenable
to
public
opinion
the
nation
will
continue
to
live
in
anarchy
whatever
their
contractual
obligation
may
be
and
under
condition
o
anarchy
it
be
power
and
not
public
opinion
that
count
the
fundamental
though
not
the
only
explanation
of
the
tragic
history
o
the
last
eight
year
be
to
be
found
in
the
failure
of
the
english
speak
democracy
to
realize
that
they
could
prevent
aggression
only
by
unity
and
by
be
strongly
arm
enough
to
resist
it
wherever
it
be
attempt
this
point
of
view
have
be
express
earlier
in
the
house
of
lord
by
lothian
and
astor
on
april
the
former
say
one
of
herr
hitler
great
advantage
have
be
that
for
very
long
what
he
sought
a
great
many
people
all
over
the
world
felt
be
not
unreasonable
whatever
they
may
have
thought
of
his
method
but
that
justification
have
completely
and
absolutely
disappear
in
the
last
three
month
it
begin
to
disappear
in
my
mind
at
the
godesberg
conference
i
think
the
right
answer
to
the
situation
be
what
mr
churchill
have
advocate
elsewhere
a
grand
alliance
of
all
those
nation
whose
interest
be
paramountly
concerned
with
the
maintenance
of
their
own
status
quo
but
in
my
view
if
you
be
go
to
do
that
you
have
get
to
have
a
grand
alliance
which
will
function
not
only
in
the
west
of
europe
but
also
in
the
east
i
agree
with
what
my
noble
friend
lord
snell
have
just
say
that
in
that
eastern
alliance
russia
may
be
absolutely
vital
nobody
will
suspect
me
of
any
ideological
sympathy
with
russia
or
communism
i
have
even
less
ideological
sympathy
with
soviet
russia
than
i
have
with
the
czarist
russia
but
in
resist
aggression
it
be
power
alone
that
count
he
then
go
on
to
advocate
national
service
and
be
vigorously
support
by
lord
astor
both
in
regard
to
this
and
in
regard
to
the
necessity
of
bring
russia
into
the
grand
alliance
from
this
point
onward
the
course
of
the
milner
group
be
more
rigid
against
germany
this
appear
chiefly
as
an
increase
emphasis
on
rearmament
and
national
service
policy
which
the
group
have
be
support
for
a
long
time
unlike
the
chamberlain
group
they
learn
a
lesson
from
the
event
of
march
it
would
be
a
mistake
however
to
believe
that
they
be
determine
to
resist
any
far
acquisition
of
territory
or
economic
advantage
by
germany
not
at
all
they
would
undoubtedly
have
be
willing
to
allow
frontier
rectification
in
the
polish
corridor
or
elsewhere
in
favor
of
germany
i
these
be
accomplish
by
a
real
process
of
negotiation
and
include
area
inhabit
by
german
and
if
the
economic
interest
of
poland
such
as
her
trade
outlet
to
the
baltic
be
protect
in
this
the
milner
group
be
still
motivate
by
idea
of
fairness
and
justice
and
by
a
desire
to
avoid
a
war
the
chief
change
be
two
they
now
felt
as
they
in
contrast
to
chamberlain
group
have
long
suspect
that
peace
could
be
preserve
well
by
strength
than
by
weakness
and
they
now
felt
that
hitler
would
not
stop
at
any
point
base
only
on
justice
but
be
seek
world
domination
the
short
run
goal
of
the
milner
group
still
remain
a
continent
dominate
by
hitler
between
an
oceanic
bloc
on
the
west
and
the
soviet
union
on
the
east
that
they
assume
such
a
solution
could
keep
the
peace
even
on
a
short
term
basis
show
the
fundamental
naivete
of
the
milner
group
the
important
point
be
that
this
view
do
not
prohibit
any
modification
of
the
polish
frontier
not
do
it
require
any
airtight
understand
with
the
soviet
union
it
do
involve
an
immediate
rearm
o
britain
and
a
determination
to
stop
hitler
if
he
move
by
force
again
o
these
three
point
the
first
two
be
share
with
the
chamberlain
group
the
third
be
not
the
difference
rest
on
the
fact
that
the
chamberlain
group
hop
to
permit
britain
to
escape
from
the
necessity
of
fight
germany
by
get
russia
to
fight
germany
the
chamberlain
group
do
not
share
the
milner
group
naive
belief
in
the
possibility
o
three
great
power
bloc
stand
side
by
side
in
peace
lack
that
belief
they
prefer
a
german
russian
war
to
a
british
german
war
and
have
that
preference
they
differ
from
the
milner
group
in
their
willingness
to
accept
the
partition
of
poland
by
germany
the
milner
group
would
have
yield
part
of
poland
to
germany
if
do
by
fair
negotiation
the
chamberlain
group
be
quite
prepared
to
liquidate
poland
entirely
if
it
could
be
present
to
the
british
people
in
term
which
they
would
accept
without
demand
war
here
again
appear
the
difference
we
have
already
mention
between
the
milner
group
and
lloyd
george
in
and
between
the
group
and
baldwin
in
namely
that
the
milner
group
tend
to
neglect
the
electoral
consideration
so
important
to
a
party
politician
in
chamberlain
be
primarily
interested
in
building
up
to
a
victorious
electoral
campaign
for
november
and
as
sir
horace
wilson
told
german
special
representative
wohl
in
june
it
be
all
one
to
the
government
whether
the
election
be
held
under
the
cry
be
ready
for
a
come
war
or
under
a
cry
a
last
understand
with
germany
these
distinction
between
the
point
of
view
of
the
milner
group
and
that
of
the
chamberlain
group
be
very
subtle
and
have
nothing
in
common
with
the
generally
accepted
idea
of
a
contrast
between
appeasement
and
resistance
there
be
still
appeaser
to
be
found
chiefly
in
those
rank
of
the
conservative
party
most
remote
from
the
milner
group
british
public
opinion
be
quite
clearly
commit
to
resistance
after
march
the
two
government
group
between
these
with
the
chamberlain
group
closer
to
the
former
and
the
milner
group
closer
to
the
latter
it
be
a
complete
error
to
say
as
most
student
of
the
period
have
say
that
before
march
the
government
be
solidly
appeasement
and
afterwards
solidly
resistant
the
chamberlain
group
after
march
be
just
as
partial
to
appeasement
as
before
perhaps
more
so
but
it
have
to
adopt
a
pretense
of
resistance
to
satisfy
public
opinion
and
keep
a
way
open
to
wage
the
november
election
on
either
side
of
the
issue
the
milner
group
be
anti
appeasement
after
march
but
in
a
limited
way
that
do
not
involve
any
commitment
to
defend
the
territorial
integrity
of
poland
or
to
ally
with
russia
this
complicate
situation
be
make
more
so
by
the
fact
that
the
milner
group
itself
be
disintegrate
some
member
chiefly
in
the
second
circle
like
hoare
or
simon
continued
as
wholehearted
i
secret
appeaser
and
become
closer
to
chamberlain
halifax
who
do
not
have
to
run
for
office
could
speak
his
mind
more
honestly
and
probably
have
a
more
honest
mind
he
be
closer
to
the
milner
group
although
he
continued
to
cooperate
so
closely
with
chamberlain
that
he
undoubtedly
lose
the
prime
minister
post
in
may
as
a
result
amery
closer
than
halifax
to
the
inner
core
of
the

also
more
of
a

and
by

lothian
be
in
a

between

and

the

as
a
retreat
from
the

perhaps
our
slowness

the
more
aloof
and
more
conciliatory
point
of

of
halifax
can
be
see
in
his
speech
of
june
in
the
house
of

the
famous
speech
o

before

o

affair
the
linger
overtone
of

the

result
in
a
spirit
attack
by
lord

while
arthur

who
have
earlier
be
plump
for

the

with

as

by

of

at
all
soul
to
meet
stalin

in

to
get
an

the
event
of
do
not
require
our
extend
attention
here
although
they
have
never
yet
be
narrate
in
any
adequate
fashion
the
german
seizure
of
bohemia
and
moravia
be
not
much
of
a
surprise
to
either
the
milner
or
chamberlain
group
both
accepted
it
but
the
former
try
to
use
it
as
a
propaganda
device
to
help
get
conscription
while
the
latter
soon
discover
that
whatever
their
real
thought
they
must
publicly
condemn
it
in
order
to
satisfy
the
outrage
moral
feeling
of
the
british
electorate
it
be
this
which
explains
the
change
in
tone
between
chamberlain
speech
of
march
in
common
and
his
speech
of
march
in
birmingham
the
former
be
what
he
thought
the
latter
be
what
he
thought
the
voter
want
the
unilateral
guarantee
to
poland
give
by
chamberlain
on
march
be
also
a
reflection
of
what
he
believe
the
voter
want
he
have
no
intention
of
ever
fulfil
the
guarantee
if
it
could
possibly
be
evade
and
for
this
reason
refuse
the
polish
request
for
a
small
rearmament
loan
and
to
open
immediate
staff
discussion
to
implement
the
guarantee
the
milner
group
less
susceptible
to
public
opinion
do
not
want
the
guarantee
to
poland
at
all
as
a
result
the
guarantee
be
word
to
cover
polish
independence
and
not
her
territorial
integrity
this
be
interpret
by
the
lead
article
of
the
time
for
april
to
leave
the
way
open
to
territorial
revision
without
revoke
the
guarantee
this
interpretation
be
accepted
by
chamberlain
in
common
on
april
apparently
the
government
believe
that
it
be
make
no
real
commitment
because
if
war
broke
out
in
eastern
europe
british
public
opinion
would
force
the
government
to
declare
war
on
germany
no
matter
what
the
government
itself
want
and
regardless
whether
the
guarantee
exist
or
not
on
the
other
hand
a
guarantee
to
poland
might
deter
hitler
from
precipitate
a
war
and
give
the
government
time
to
persuade
the
polish
government
to
yield
the
corridor
to
germany
if
the
pole
could
not
be
persuade
or
if
germany
inarched
the
fat
be
in
the
fire
anyway
if
the
pole
could
be
persuade
to
yield
the
guarantee
be
so
word
that
britain
could
not
act
under
it
to
prevent
such
yield
this
be
to
block
any
possibility
that
british
public
opinion
might
refuse
to
accept
a
polish
munich
that
this
line

by

but
dalton

this
it
be
quite
clear
that
neither
the
chamberlain
group
nor
the
milner
group
want
an
alliance
with
the
soviet
union
to
stop
hitler
in
and
that
the
negotiation
be
not
sincere
or
vigorously
pursue
the
milner
group
be
not
so
oppose
to
such
an
agreement
as
the
chamberlain
group
both
be
commit
to
the
four
power
pact
in
the
case
o
the
chamberlain
group
this
pact
could
easily
have
developed
into
an
anti
russian
alliance
but
in
the
case
of
the
milner
group
it
be
regard
merely
as
a
link
between
the
oceanic
bloc
and
a
germanic
mitteleuropa
both
group
hat
and
despise
the
soviet
union
but
the
milner
group
do
not
fear
it
as
the
chamberlain
group
do
this
fear
be
base
on
the
marxist
threat
to
the
british
economic
system
and
the
milner
group
be
not
wed
nearly
as
closely
to
that
system
as
chamberlain
and
his
friend
the
toynbee
milner
tradition
however
weak
it
have
become
by
be
enough
to
prevent
the
two
group
from
see
eye
to
eye
on
this
issue
the
effort
of
the
chamberlain
group
to
continue
the
policy
of
appeasement
by
make
economic
and
other
concession
to
germany
and
their
effort
to
get
hitler
to
agree
to
a
four
power
pact
form
one
o
the
most
shameful
episode
in
the
history
of
recent
british
diplomacy
these
negotiation
be
chiefly
conduct
through
sir
horace
wilson
and
consist
chiefly
of
offer
of
colonial
bribe
and
other
concession
to
germany
these
offer
be
either
reject
or
ignore
by
the
nazi
one
of
these
offer
revolve
around
a
semi
official
economic
agreement
under
which
british
and
german
industrialist
would
form
cartel
agreement
in
all
field
to
fix
price
of
their
product
and
divide
up
the
world
market
the
milner
group
apparently
object
to
this
on
the
ground
that
it
be
aim
or
could
be
aim
at
the

nevertheless
the

the

see
when
news
of

do
leak
out
and
result
in
a
violent
controversy
in

the

by
the

a
break
in
the
negotiation
the
negotiation
however
be
already
bogging
down
because
o
the
refusal
of
the
german
to
become
very
interested
in
them
hitler
and
ribbentrop
by
this
time
despise
the
british
so
thoroughly
that
they
paid
no
attention
to
them
at
all
and
the
german
ambassador
in
london
found
it
impossible
to
reach
ribbentrop
his
official
superior
either
by
dispatch
or
personally
chamberlain
however
in
his
eagerness
to
make
economic
concession
to
germany
give
to
hitler
million
in
czechoslovak
gold
in
the
bank
of
england
and
kept
lord
runciman
busy
training
to
be
chief
economic
negotiator
in
the
great
agreement
which
he
envisage
on
july
kordt
the
german
charge
d

in

have
a
long
talk
with
charles

buxton
brother
of
the
labour
peer
lord
noel
buxton
about
the
term
of
this
agreement
which
be
to
be
pattern
on
the
agreement
of
between
britain
and
russia
buxton
insist
that
his
visit
be
quite
unofficial
but
kordt
be
inclined
to
believe
that
his
visit
be
a
feeler
from
the
chamberlain
group
in
view
of
the
close
parallel
between
buxton
view
and
chamberlain
this
seem
very
likely
this
be
corroborate
when
sir
horace
wilson
repeat
these
view
in
a
highly
secret
conversation
with
dirksen
at
wilson
home
from
to
p
m
on
august
dirksens
minute
o
the
same
day
show
that
wilson
aim
have
not
change
he
want
a
four
power
pact
a
free
hand
for
germany
in
eastern
europe
a
colonial
agreement
an
economic
agreement
etc
the
memorandum
read
in
part
after
recapitulate
his
conversation
with
wohlthat
sir
horace
wilson
expatiate
at
length
on
the
great
risk
chamberlain
would
incur
by
start
confidential
negotiation
with
the
german
government
if
anything
about
them
be
to
leak
out
there
would
be
a
grand
scandal
and
chamberlain
would
probably
be
force
to
resign
dirksen
do
not
see
how
any
binding
agreement
could
be
reach
under
condition
such
as
this
for
example
owe
to
hudson
indiscretion
another
visit
o
herr
wohlthat
to
london
be
out
of
the
question
m
to
this
wilson
suggest
that
the
two
emissary
could
meet
in
switzerland
or
elsewhere
the
political
portion
o
this
conversation
be
largely
repeat
in
an
interview
that
dirksen
have
with
lord
halifax
on
august
it
be
not
possible
to
conceal
these
activity
completely
from
the
public
and
indeed
government
spokesman
refer
to
them
occasionally
in
trial
balloon
on
may
chamberlain
suggest
an
anglo
german
nonaggression
pact
although
only
five
day
earlier
hitler
have
denounce
the
anglo
german
naval
agreement
of
and
the
polish
german
nonaggression
pact
o
as
late
as
august
sir
nevile
henderson
offer
germany
a
british
alliance
if
she
be
successful
in
direct
negotiation
with
the
pole
this
however
be
a
personal
statement
and
probably
go
far
than
halifax
would
have
be
willing
to
go
by
halifax
apparently
have
little
faith
in
chamberlain
s
ability
to
obtain
any
settlement
with
the
german
if
by
mean
of
another
munich
he
could
have
obtain
a
german
polish
settlement
that
would
satisfy
germany
and
avoid
war
he
would
have
take
it
it
be
the
hope
of
such
an
agreement
that
prevent
him
from
make
any
real
agreement
with
russia
for
it
be
apparently
the
expectation
of
the
british
government
that
if
the
german
could
get
the
polish
corridor
by
negotiation
they
could
then
drive
into
russia
across
the
baltic
state
for
this
reason
in
the
negotiation
with
russia
halifax
refuse
any
multilateral
pact
against
aggression
any
guarantee
of
the
baltic
state
or
any
tripartite
guarantee
of
poland
instead
he
sought
to
get
nothing
more
than
a
unilateral
russian
guarantee
to
poland
to
match
the
british
guarantee
to
the
same
country
this
be
much
too
dangerous
for
russia
to
swallow
since
it
would
leave
her
with
a
commitment
which
could
lead
to
war
and
with
no
promise
o
british
aid
to
her
if
she
be
attack
directly
after
a
polish
settlement
or
indirectly
across
the
baltic
state
only
after
the
german
soviet
nonaggression
pact
o
august
do
halifax
implement
the
unilateral
guarantee
to
poland
with
a
more
formal
mutual
assistance
pact
between
britain
and
poland
this
be
do
to
warn
hitler
that
an
attack
on
poland
would
bring
britain
into
the
war
under
pressure
of
british
public
opinion
hitler
as
usual
paid
no
attention
to
britain
even
after
the
german
attack
on
poland
the
british
government
be
reluctant
to
fulfill
this
pact
and
spent
almost
three
day
ask
the
german
to
return
to
negotiation
even
after
the
british
be
force
to
declare
war
on
germany
they
make
no
effort
to
fight
content
themselves
with
drop
leaflet
on
germany
we
now
know
that
the
german
general
have
move
so
much
of
their
force
to
the
east
that
they
be
gravely
worried
at
the
effect
which
might
follow
an
allied
attack
on
western
germany
or
even
an
aerial
bombing
of
the
ruhr
in
these
event
of
the
milner
group
take
little
part
they
must
have
know
of
the
negotiation
with
germany
and
probably
do
not
disapprove
of
them
but
they
have
little
faith
in
them
and
by
the
early
summer
of
be
probably
convince
that
war
with
germany
be
inevitable
in
the
long
run
in
this
view
halifax
probably
share
but
other
former
member
of
the
group
such
as
hoare
and
simon
by
now
be
completely
in
the
chamberlain
group
and
can
no
longer
be
regard
as
member
of
the
milner
group
from
june
to
may
the
fissure
between
the
milner
group
and
the
chamberlain
government
become
wider
from
the
outbreak
of
war
the
milner
group
be
determine
to
fight
the
war
against
germany
the
chamberlain
group
on
the
other
hand
be
very
reluctant
to
fight
germany
prefer
to
combine
a
declare
but
unfought
war
with
germany
with
a
fought
but
undeclared
war
with
russia
the
excuse
for
this
last
arose
from
the
russian
pressure
on
finland
for
base
to
resist
a
future
german
attack
the
russian
attack
on
finland
begin
on
the
last
day
o
november
by
december
the
british
and
french
be
put
pressure
on
sweden
to
join
them
in
action
to
support
the
finn
in
these
note
which
have
be
publish
by
the
swedish
foreign
ministry
the
western
power
state
that
they
intend
to
send
men
equipment
and
money
to

by
february
the
western
power
have
plan
for
a

o
to
men
for
finland
and
be
put
pressure
on
sweden
to
allow
passage
for
this
force
across
scandinavia
by
march
the
british
have
a
force
of
men
ready
and
inform
the
swedish
and
norwegian
government
that
the
force
with
its
full
equipment
be
available
and
could
sail
at
short
notice
they
invite
the
scandinavian
country
to
receive
allied
mission
to
make
all
the
necessary
preparation
for
the
transit
the
note
to
norway
in
an
additional
passage
say
that
force
would
be
sent
to
the
norwegian
port
within
four
day
of
receive
permission
and
the
transit
itself
could
begin
on
march
on
march
the
ally
sent
to
the
scandinavian
country
a
formal
request
for
right
of
transit
it
be
refuse
before
anything
far
could
be
do
finland
collapse
and
make
peace
with
russia
on
april
halifax
sent
a
very
threaten
note
to
the
scandinavian
country
it
say
in
part
consider
in
consultation
with
the
french
government
the
circumstance
attend
the
termination
of
the
war
between
the
union
of
soviet
socialist
republic
and
finland
and
the
attitude
adopt
by
the
swedish
government
at
that
time
they
feel
therefore
that
the
time
have
come
to
notify
the
swedish
government
frankly
of
certain
vital
interest
and
requirement
which
the
allied
government
intend
to
assert
and
defend
by
whatever
measure
they
may
think
necessary
the
vital
interest
and
the
requirement
which
the
allied
government
wish
to
bring
to
the
notice
of
the
swedish
government
be
the
follow
a
the
allied
government
cannot
acquiesce
in
any
far
attack
on
finland
by
either
the
soviet
or
german
government
in
the
event
therefore
of
such
an
attack
take
place
any
refusal
by
the
swedish
government
to
facilitate
the
effort
of
the
allied
government
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
finland
in
whatever
manner
they
may
think
fit
and
still
more
any
attempt
to
prevent
such
assistance
would
be
consider
by
the
allied
government
as
endanger
their
vital
interest
c
any
attempt
by
the
soviet
government
to
obtain
from
norway
a
footing
on
the
atlantic
seaboard
would
be
contrary
to
the
vital
interest
o
the
allied
government
the
swedish
foreign
minister
express
his
government
astonishment
at
this
note
and
its
determination
to
decide
such
question
for
itself
and
to
preserve
sweden
neutrality
in
the
future
as
it
have
be
preserve
in
the
past
it
be
not
clear
what
be
the
attitude
o
the
milner
group
toward
this
effort
to
open
active
hostility
against
the
soviet
union
while
remain
technically
in
a
state
of
war
with
germany
halifax
be
still
at
the
foreign
office
and
apparently
actively
concerned
in
this
project
the
time
be
wholeheartedly
in
favor
of
the
plan
on
march
for
example
it
say
of
the
finnish
war
it
be
become
clearer
every
day
that
this
war
be
no
side
issue
finland
be
defend
more
than
the
cause
of
liberty
and
more
than
her
own
soil
our
own
cause
be
be
but
ressed
by
her
resistance
to
the
evil
of
tryanny
our
interest
be
clear
and
there
be
a
moral
issue
involve
as
well
as
the
material
the
whole
sentiment
of
this
country
demand
that
finland
should
not
be
allow
to
fall
the
round
table
in
the
only
issue
which
appear
during
the
finnish
trouble
have
a
propagandist
article
on
the
civilization
of
finland
it
call
finland
one
of
the
most
democratic
nation
on
any
definition
in
all
europe
the
rest
of
the
article
be
a
paean
of
praise
for
the
kind
and
magnanimous
conduct
of
the
finnish
government
in
every
crisis
of
its
history
from
but
nothing
be
say
about
the
finnish
war
nor
be
there
any
mention
of
allied
aid
during
this
period
the
milner
group
become
increasingly
impatient
with
the
chamberlain
group
this
be
clear
from
the
june
issue
o
the
round
table
which
criticize
the
cabinet
reshuffle
of
april
as
evoke
almost
universal
derision
it
also
criticize
chamberlain
failure
to
include
able
member
of
his
own
party
in
the
cabinet
this
may
have
be
a
reference
to
amery
continued
exclusion
the
article
say
this
lack
of
imagination
and
courage
could
be
see
in
almost
every
aspect
of
the
chamberlain
government
conduct
of
the
war
it
exclude
simon
and
hoare
as
possible
prime
minister
on
the
ground
that
they
be
too
close
to
chamberlain
it
be
probably
think
of
halifax
as
prime
minister
but
when
the
time
come
others
thought
him
also
to
be
too
closely
associate
with
appeasement
on
the
crucial
day
may
the
group
be
badly
split
in
fact
on
the
division
that
precede

while
her

the
debate
be
one
of
the
most
bitter
in
recent
history
and
reach
its
high
point
when
amery
cry
out
to
the
government
bench
the
word
of
cromwell
you
have
sat
too
long
here
for

you

and
let
us
have
do
with
you
in

gol
in
the
ensue

the

be
on
with
a
vengeance
but
the
government
majority
be
only
more
than
a
hundred
conservative
abstain
from
voting
most
of
the

since
they
held

with

the

the

two
