time
in

press
question
for
the
chairman
and
ceo
of
jpmorgan

would
dimon
be
interested
in
acquire
the
flounder
investment
bank
morgan
stanley
at
no
cost
whatsoever
during
one
of
the
most
tumultuous
month
in
the
history
of
the
stock
market
stock
fell
percent
between
august
and
october
the
storied
investment
bank
lehman
brother
have
already
fail
the
brokerage
giant
merrill
lynch
have
be
sell
to
bank
of
america
and
the
insurance
heavyweight
aig
have
receive
an
emergency
loan
of
billion
from
the
federal
government
one
of
the
only
remain
question
be
whether
it
would
be
morgan
stanley
or
goldman
sachs
that
fell
next
the
government
be
desperately
seek
to
stave
off
what
could
have
be
a
wipeout
of
wall
street
and
here
be
paulson
offering
dimon
morgan
stanley
for
the
bargain
basement
price
of
per
share
at
the
government
s
urge
dimon
have
agree
to
take
over
bear
stearns
for
a
share
in
march
in
a
whirlwind
hour
deal
the
price
be
ultimately
raise
to
the
transaction
have
catapult
jpmorgan
chase
to
the
forefront
of
the
financial
industry
and
establish
dimon
as
the
government
s
banker
of
last
resort
some
be
come
to
washington
for
help
sheila
bair
chairman
of
the
federal
deposit
insurance
corporation
later
say
others
be
come
to
washington
to
help
consider
in
a
historical
light
a
takeover
of
morgan
stanley
would
have
be
much
more
profound
than
that
of
bear
stearns
dimon
be
already
be
compare
to
john
pierpont
morgan
the
legendary
banker
who
be
his
company
s
founder
and
this
deal
would
have
meant
a
reassemble
of
the
empire
that
have
be
forcibly
dismantle
during
the
great
depression
when
bank
be
bar
from
the
security
trade
dimon
in
other
word
would
have
be
sit
atop
the
very
same
empire
his
firm
s
namesake
have
lord
over
nearly
a
century
before
but
it
be
not
to
be
dimon
reportedly
say
he
d
discus
it
with
his
board
but
his
initial
view
be
that
his
bank
shouldn
t
do
it
it
would
involve
a
bloodbath
for
employee
on
both
side
a
double
of
risk
and
year
of
distraction
for
the
company
what
s
more
the
ultimate
cost
of
a
deal
would
have
be
quite
substantial
whether
in
term
of
layoff
writedowns
or
a
de
risk
of
morgan
stanley
s
balance
sheet
dimon
have
always
say
it
doesn
t
make
sense
for
two
major
investment
bank
to
merge
moreover
his
team
be
already
busy
prepare
a
bid
to
take
over
the
deposit
and
loan
of
the
seattle
base
bank
washington
mutual
also
on
the
verge
of
failure
the
amaze
thing
paulson
really
didn
t
have
anyone
else
to
turn
to
dimon
be
quite
literally
the
only
chief
of
a
major
bank
to
have
properly
prepared
for
the
hundred
year
storm
that
have
hit
wall
street
with
such
vengeance
everyone
have
know
that
the
capital
base
of
the
financial
sector
have
be
in
desperate
need
of
shore
up
but
jamie
dimon
be
alone
among
his
peer
in
have
actually
do
something
instead
of
just
talk
about
it
as
a
result
of
all
the
action
take
by
the
government
in
the
fifteen
month
since
the
crisis
have
start
the
only
thing
that
have
really
work
be
give
it
to
jamie
which
be
exactly
why
a
desperate
paulson
be
try
to
do
it
again
but
he
prove
unable
to
persuade
dimon
to
pull
off
a
third
major
deal
in
morgan
stanley
eventually
pull
through
but
even
without
this
deal
dimon
s
reputation
continued
to
ascend
to
new
height
in
the
midst
of
the
most
serious
and
far
reach
financial
crisis
since
the
s
much
of
it
cause
by
plain
old
avarice
and
bad
judgment
dimon
and
jpmorgan
chase
stood
apart
much
of
the
melodramatic
coverage
of
wall
street
postcrisis
have
focus
on
its
flaw
the
hubris
and
the
greed
jamie
dimon
s
story
contains
the
opposite
the
value
of
clarity
consistency
integrity
and
courage
by
stick
to
them
dimon
have
unquestionably
become
the
dominant
banking
executive
of
his
era

a
very
good
business
if
you
don
t
do
anything
dumb

warren
buffett
morris
shapiro
say
long
ago
that
there
be
more
bank
than
banker
and
that
s
fundamentally
the

i
learn
a
lot
there
include
the
idea
of

research
i
have
no
idea
that
if

it
drove
him
crazy
that
he
didn
t
do

and
i
do
recall
burke

ask
if
he
could
read
burke
s
blue
book

well
than
me
say
burke
to
put
himself
out
there

an
outspoken
one
at
that
he
be
also
prone

dimon
headlong
into
his
first
deal
complete
with
late
night
negotiation
at
a
suite
in
the
waldorf
astoria
hotel
weill
come
up
with
something
akin
to
a
three
way
trade
in
baseball
instead
of
lease
space
he
argue
they
should
buy
a
new
building
in
the
wfc
in
exchange
for
buying
a
building
in
what
be
an
extremely
tough
real

climate
the
reichmans
would
then
buy
american
express
s
old
corporate
headquarters
the
company
could
then
use
the
gain
from
that
sale
to
offset
the
loss
from
sell
the
municipal
bond
thereby
avoid

jamie
be
an
important
part
of
building
a
fact
base
so
we
could
make
our
point
to
other
people
in
the
company
or
on
the
board
recall
weill
he
be
a
very
quick
student
that
success
notwithstanding
it
wasn
t
long
before
weill
begin
to
feel
stifle
by
the
formal
bureaucratic
american
express
it
be
nothing
like
shearson
he
realize
that
his
role
as
chairman
of
the
executive
committee
be
a
hollow
one
that
give
him
no
authority
whatsoever
and
in
january
when
alva
way
the
president
of
american
express
resign
weill
make
a
serious
miscalculation
at
robinson
s
request
he
cede
the
role
of
ceo
of
shearson
to
peter
cohen
in
exchange
for
a
promotion
to
president
of
the
overall
company
what
he
d
do
be
relinquish
control
of
an
operating
business
and
he
become
as
monica
langley
put
it
a
president
without
portfolio
after
buying
his
company
robinson
have
take
less
than
two
year
to
effectively
castrate
weill
cohen
played
his
part
too
he
later
told
the
reporter
jon
friedman
that
he
have
push
weill
up
and
out
despite
see
weill
treat
this
way
dimon
remembers
robinson
fondly
he
saw
robinson
as
a
smart
man
who
work
hard
and
be
well
connect
although
also
as
one
who
ran
an
unnecessarily
bureaucratic
shop
they
protect
that
amex
brand
like
you
wouldn
t
believe
dimon
recall
the
customer
service
be
fabulous
shorn
of
operating
responsibility
weill
decide
that
he
need
another
deal
to
keep
himself
relevant
his
first
target
investor
diversified
service
id
a
minneapolis
base
provider
of
financial
service
with
his
trusty
b
school
tool
in
hand
the
hewlett
packard
hp
c
calculator
dimon
played
a
central
role
in
the
negotiation
shuttle
between
new
york
and
minneapolis
where
he
met
with
id
s
financial
team
in
a
hotel
in
a
shock
to
weill
peter
cohen
effectively
block
the
deal
when
it
first
come
up
for
a
vote
weill
s
onetime
prot
g
have
stabbed
him
in
the
back
and
although
the
deal
eventually
get
do
weill
still
felt
marginalize
by
cohen
and
in
need
of
yet
another
deal
around
this
time
dimon
report
to
tuft
that
he
be
vice
president
and
assistant
to
the
president
of
american
express
he
described
his
job
as
exhilarate
demand
and
a
lot
of
fun
there
be
no
doubt
it
be
demand
especially
consider
that
there
d
be
no
training
program
or
guidebook
to
help
him
navigate
his
entr
e
into
the
world
of
high
stake
deal
make
even
sandy
weill
would
admit
that
he
have
never
be
much
of
a
teacher
and
that
if
dimon
want
to
learn
the
in
and
out
of
the
business
it
be
largely
up
to
him
to
be
a
self
starter
luckily
for
dimon
he
be
exactly
that

jamie
dimon
have
always
be
a
man
in
a
hurry
and
in
matter
of
the
heart
he
be
no
different
he
d
propose
to
judy
kent
while
they
be
still
at
harvard
when
it
come
time
to
actually
get
married
however
there
be
one
issue
that
the
couple
need
to
navigate
kent
be
jewish
her
parent
after
briefly
entertain
the
notion
that
dimon
might
convert
to
judaism
realize
the
folly
of
the
idea
when
kent
explain
to
them
that
while
dimon
respect
other
people
faith
he
do
not
want
to
be
confine
by
organize
religion
and
that
there
be
no
point
in
raise
the
conversion
issue
whatsoever
dimon
refer
to
himself
as
the
great
compromiser
agree
to
meet
the
rabbi
who
be
to
marry
them
i
wasn
t
even
speak
to
him
at
that
point
as
i
be
so
mad
judy
dimon
recall
thing
be
get
pretty
tense
the
two
men
have
a
brief
conversation
in
which
the
rabbi
try
to
convince
dimon
that
he
need
not
change
to
become
jewish
but
dimon
wouldn
t
budge
i
be
what
i
be
he
say
and
the
issue
be
close
when
he
and
judy
next
spoke
dimon
inform
her
in
no
uncertain
term
that
although
he
would
allow
the
rabbi
to
marry
them
he
would
give
the
man
just
ten
minute
she
could
write
her
vow
and
he
would
write
his
own
the
ceremony
on
may
in
washington
d
c
go
off
without
a
hitch
judy
be
work
at
shearson
at
this
point
as
an
assistant
to
joseph
plumeri
the
colorful
italian
american
director
of
marketing
and
sale
at
the
firm
plumeri
remembers
kent
as
whip
smart
but
always
a
little
frazzle
she
always
have
run
in
her
stocking
so
he
once
give
her
pair
for
christmas
judy
dimon
work
at
shearson
for
three
year
as
a
vice
president
in
marketing
before
quit
her
job
two
month
after
the
arrival
of
julia
the
couple
s
first
child
on
may
almost
immediately
though
she
dove
into
a
second
career
in
the
nonprofit
sector
take
a
job
as
executive
director
of
the
spunk

on
improve
the
life
of
impoverish

the

aid
society
in

help
support
inner
city
school
her
sacrifice
be
reward
by
dimon
s
own
commitment
to
family
however
constrain
his
career
demand
might
be
the
conventional
wisdom
about
dimon
be
that
he
have
few
interest
outside
the
office
a
simplification
that
irritates
him
i
love
music
and
i
read
a
lot
and
i
exercise
and
play
tennis
and
i
ski
he
say
so
i
don
t
play
golf
so
what
i
think
it
would
be
fair
to
say
that
when
the
kid
be
born
they
become
my
outside
hobby
i
cut
way
back
on
the
other
stuff
and
devote
as
much
time
as
i
could
for
the
family
i
still
do
until
they
be
about
we
never
take
a
vacation
without
them
the
kid
and
their
friend
would
say
i
be
around
a
lot
even
though
i
thought
i
wasn
t
but
they
probably
felt
that
way
because
when
i
be
there
i
would
be
there

in
late
weill
have
a
new
mission
the
american
express
subsidiary
fireman
s
fund
a
property
and
casualty
insurer
have
run
into
operational
and
accounting
problem
and
be
drag
its
parent
down
with
it
play
fast
and
loose
in
a
highly
competitive
insurance
environment
the
unit
s
management
have
boost
premium
growth
without
a
coincident
increase
in
reserve
and
a
sudden
spike
in
insurance
claim
be
cause
massive
loss
bad
it
appear
that
executive
have
try
to
cover
up
their
miscalculation
in
late
a
million
increase
in
the
fireman
fund
s
reserve
cause
american
express
to
report
its
first

decline
in
year
robinson
ask
weill
to
head
to
san
francisco
and
resolve
the
problem
weill
be
reluctant
to
do
so
it
wasn
t
hard
to
see
that
he
be
be
exile
but
he
also
realize
he
really
have
no
choice
and
acquiesce
he
take
dimon
along
with
him
as
well
as
bill
mccormick
a
senior
american
express
executive
the
three
spent
several
week
together
before
launch
an
audacious
turnaround
in
early
in
which
weill
fire
percent
of
the
unit
s
employee
and
raise
premium
this
stanch
the
loss
but
the
division
remain
a
drag
on
american
express
s
balance
sheet
the
unit
need
another
million
in
fresh
capital
in
november
and
robinson
soon
decide
he
want
to
unload
it
weill
saw
an
opportunity
know
that
robinson
wouldn
t
be
too
sorry
to
see
him
go
weill
propose
to
his
bos
that
he
buy
fireman
s
fund
from
the
company
though
concerned
about
give
the
impression
that
weill
have
gotten
the
well
of
him
robinson
nevertheless
allow
him
to
explore
the
possibility
of
a
deal
at
this
point
dimon
suggest
that
weill
approach
warren
buffett
the
two
men
met
with
buffett
briefly
in
new
york
and
then
flew
to
his
omaha
headquarters
to
pitch
the
legend
on
the
idea
of
funding
a
buyout
buffett
be
interested
in
their
proposal
he
offer
to
buy
percent
or
more
of
the
unit
if
it
be
sell
and
the
pair
left
omaha
think
an
opportunity
be
at
hand
in
may
weill
make
his
proposal
to
the
board
american
express
would
keep
percent
of
the
business
warren
buffett
would
own
percent
and
weill
would
own
percent
pursuant
to
a
number
of
condition
and
guarantee
weill
have
hire
morgan
stanley
to
represent
him
in
the
deal
for
reason
of
its
own
include
a
desire
not
to
be
embarrass
if
sandy
weill
manage
to
take
profit
that
could
be
theirs
alone
the
board
reject
the
idea
it
be
a
weird
situation
dimon
recall
someone
say
at
the
time
that
american
express
couldn
t
do
a
deal
if
sandy
morgan
stanley
and
warren
buffett
be
on
the
other
side
that
s
part
of
the
reason
sandy
have
offer
to
let
them
keep
percent
so
if
they
thought
it
be
a
little
cheap
they
d
make
it
back
on
the
back
end
but
i
really
hope
that
wasn
t
the
reason
they
didn
t
do
it
because
that
would
be
pretty
stupid
the
prospect
of
partner
with
warren
buffett
be
dead
weill
sense
that
robinson
have
outmaneuver
him
he
d
give
up
his
operational
responsibility
and
be
now
be
treat
as
an
adversary
by
the
board
of
the
very
company
he
work
for
he
decide
he
have
to
resign
and
he
do
on
monday
june
sandy
never
fit
in
there
anyway
recall
alison
fall
mcelvery
one
of
his
assistant
at
the
time
on
the
one
hand
you
have
all
these
upstanding
press
and
beautiful
people
like
jim
robinson
who
just
reek
of
money
and
then
you
have
sandy
who
would
yell
down
the
hallway
to
ask
someone
how
their
weekend
have
be
this
despite
the
fact
that
weill
have
a
great
net
worth
than
robinson
the
question
for
the
year
old
dimon
should
he
go
with
weill
jim
robinson
offer
to
keep
dimon
on
as
a
vice
president
in
another
role
and
by
that
point
he
could
have
work
anywhere
else
he
want
maybe
even
at
goldman
it
be
a
complex
decision
dimon
recall
many
friend
include
stephen
burke
and
andrall
pearson
president
and
chief
operating
officer
of
pepsi
told
dimon
this
be
his
chance
to
cut
bait
to
admit
that
his
gamble
on
weill
have
not
pan
out
after
all
he
now
have
a
wife
and
a
child
just
a
few
week
old
to
care
for
and
weill
wasn
t
get
any
young
dimon
discuss
the
future
with
his
harvard
buddy
peter
maglathlin
that
summer
on
vacation
at
the
kent

house
in

be
this

wash
up
maglathlin
ask
do
he
even
have
another
act
i
have
faith
in
sandy
dimon
reply
something
s
go
to
happen
it
be
surely
a
mix
of
factor
loyalty
an
appetite
for
adventure
a
conviction
that
sandy
weill
have
another
run
left
in
him
that
lead
dimon
to
ignore
his
friend
advice
and
resign
from
american
express
along
with
his
bos
weill
offer
to
pay
dimon
a
year
to
stay
on
as
his

i

if
we

anything

and
in
an
ironic
twist
he
found
that

put
him
in

about

with

statement
bury
in
the

for
to
hour
a
day
dimon
grow
especially
fond
of
warren
buffett
s
missive
out
of
his
omaha

berkshire
hathaway
he
be
smitten
whenever
anything
come
out
from
berkshire

recall
mcelvery
he
would
say
you
have
to
read
this
it
s
the
great
annual
report
i
ve
ever
read
he
s
brilliant
one
meeting
that
stuck
in
dimon
s
mind
be
with
ivan
boesky
then
the
reign
practitioner
of
risk
arbitrage
on
wall
street
his
specialty
be
bet
on
whether
propose
merger
would
come
to
fruition
or
failure
and
he
be
one
of
wall
street
s
flashiest
player
i
remember
think
he
be
a
little
paranoid
recall
dimon
because
in
his
office
he
have
this
phone
bank
from
which
he
could
listen
into
any
one
of
his
employee
phone
call
it
look
like
a
cockpit
and
he
have
camera
in
every

it
be
totally
bizarre
the
first
excite
possibility
for
weill
and
dimon
come
in
late
fall
when
warren
hellman
the

its

in

fall
and
the
company
s
management
team
be
under
fire
it
be
possible
hellman
told
him
that
the
board
might
consider
wholesale
change
at
the
top
after
meeting
with
hellman
in
san
francisco
weill
and
dimon
crunched
the
number
and
determine
that
if
weill
could
arrange
a
billion
capital
infusion
plus
million
of
his
own
money
he
could
reasonably
propose
to
bankamerica
s
board
that
they
install
him
as
ceo
weill
even
swallow
his
pride
and
ask
jim

peter

if
they
want
in

the

he
holland
say

when
the

i
thought
i
might

make
a
mistake
have
stuck
by
weill
through
his
trial
at
american
express
and
in
the
empty
day
that
follow
dimon
certainly
knew
that
his
position
at
sandy
s
side
would
be
inviolate
if
a
big
deal
ever
do
come
to
pas
but
that
be
start
to
seem
like
one
big
if
the
subprime
of
his
life
when
he
graduate
from
harvard
business
school
jamie
dimon
could
never
have
imagine
that
within
four
year
he
d
be
work
for
a
bottom
of
the
barrel
lending
operation
in
a
financial
backwater
and
that
he
d
be
thrill
to
have
the
chance
but
that
s
how
it
played
out
sandy
weill
and
jamie
dimon
found
their
next
gig
at
a
decidedly
unglamorous
operation
call
commercial
credit
a
baltimore
base
lender
to
a
huge
but
overlook
sector
of
the
population
the
million
people
who
shop
at

with

these
be
people
that

service
company
generally
try
not
to
do

with
in
the
popular
lexicon
of
one
would
call
commercial
credit
a
subprime
lender
it
be
a
business
to
be
shun
in
the
s
but
the
pell
mell
pursuit
of
these
very
customer
some
year
later
would
be
one
of
the

it
wasn

that
make
its

markedly
different
from

commercial
credit
lent
over

while

the
advantage
of
this

that
the

to

crap
volland
didn
t
believe
that
weill
have
a
full
grasp
of
the
issue
and
continued
to
press
his
case
identify
underperform
asset
that
could
be
sell
include
one
unit
that
even
lease

to
ex
convict
car
for
con
his
persistence
paid
off
after
two
hour
of
discussion
weill
and
dimon
want
to
take
the
next
step
over
the
next
few
week
volland
and
dimon
spoke
several
time
as
dimon
burrow
through
the
control
data
s
financials
try
to
get
a
sense
of
commercial
credit
s
stand
alone
opportunity
help
dimon
with
this
due
diligence
weill
s
assistant
mcelvery
remark
that
the
company
be
effectively
a
loan
shark
operation
customer
paid
exceedingly
high
rate
to
borrow
money
weill
and
dimon
be
indignant
and
told
her
that
they
consider
the
business
one
of
help
the
little
guy
her
own
mother
chastise
her
for
look
down
on
the
enterprise
don
t
knock
these
people
she
told
mcelvery
they
lent
me
the
money
to
buy
my
first
refrigerator
as
monica
langley
point
out
in
tear
down
the
wall
it
be
dimon
s
legwork
that
make
them
decide
to
make
a
move
his
most
important
find
be
that
although
commercial
credit
have
just
a
percent
return
on
equity
versus
percent
for
comparable
finance
company
there
be
enough
asset
they
could
sell
and
cost
that
could
be
slash
to
consider
the
percent
mark
an
attraction
rather
than
a
deterrent
the
stock
market
like
nothing
more
than
improve
operation
and
balance
sheet
and
commercial
credit
offer
plenty
of
room
for
improvement
it
could
be
their
launch
pad
to
great
thing
the
next
step
be
to
approach
control
data
itself
weill
call
a
friend
the
hotshot
morgan
stanley
investment
banker
bob
greenhill
and
ask
him
to
contact
bob
price
chairman
of
control
data
to
see
if
price
be
amenable
to
a
conversation
he
be
and
weill
dimon
and
greenhill
flew
out
to
minneapolis
to
meet
him
weill
have
enormous
respect
for
greenhill
s
judgment
his
performance
in
a
crunch
and
his
ability
to
keep
his
eye
on
the
negotiate
ball
morgan
stanley
also
have
a
reputation
for
do
more
than
expect
deliver
much
high
quality
analysis
than
other
investment
bank
although
price
and
weill
realize
they
might
be
able
to
help
each
other
out
the
discussion
proceed
slowly
at
first
control
data
explore
every
alternative
include
raise
money
in
the
bond
market
to
buy
some
time
by
september
however
they
be
back
to
the
negotiate
table
weill
and
dimon
consider
an
outright
purchase
the
problem
be
that
it
would
require
a
leveraged
buyout
leave
the
company
under
an
unmanageably
heavy
debt
load
they
next
talk
of
a
spin
off
of
the
unit
by
mean
of
an
initial
public
offering
but
that
idea
pose
its
own
complication
as
well
the
investment
bank
first
boston
have
roped
control
data
into
a
unique
kind
of
bond
offering
that
stipulate
the
company
would
be
require
to
make
a
tender
offer
for
outstanding
bond
if
it
sell
stock
in
commercial
credit
most
spin
offs
sell
about
percent
of
a
subsidiary
s
stock
to
the
public
but
such
a
portion
wouldn
t
raise
enough
money
for
control
data
to
tender
for
the
high
yield
bond
all
these
problem
lead
to
an
audacious
idea
perhaps
the
deal
maker
wonder
the
combination
of
sandy
weill
s
reputation
and
pedigreed
morgan
stanley
run
the
transaction
might
enable
them
to
spin
off
percent
of
the
company
it
would
be
a
blockbuster
and
it
prove
to
be
the
only
feasible
option
bob
price
and
sandy
weill
agree
to
give
it
a
shot
weill
once
again
try
to
enlist
buffett
as
a
coinvestor
in
the
commercial
credit
deal
but
dimon
knew
well
sandy
warren
s
not
go
to
like
this
deal
he
told
his
bos
why
not
weill
bark
in
response
because
warren
doesn
t
do
turnaround
say
dimon
this
company
be
a
hodgepodge
of
crap
he
doesn
t
care
that
you
re
run
it
he
won
t
care
that
you
re

in
it
he
s
just
not
go
to
do
it
the
two
men

breakfast
with

in
the
oak
room
of

and
within
three
minute
buffett

that
the

as
soon
as

with
the
proviso
that

through
a
combination
of
outright
stock

grant
in
some
way
it
be
a
remarkably
counterintuitive
move
on
weill
s
part
as
mcelvery

out

for

more
he

put
their

in
the
consumer

when

to
grab
a
piece
of
the
increasingly
frenetic
action
in

on

but
this
focus
on
the
unfashionable

also
classic

be
a
distressed

in

the
kind
of

he
could
sink
his
teeth
into
and
what
of
bob
volland
the
man
who
brought
them
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
weill
and
dimon
have
jokingly
refer
to
him
as
deep
throat
during
their
initial
investigation
but
they
cut
him
out
the

thereafter
bob

one
why
would
you

of
the
opinion
that
the

ridiculous
double
standard

that

out
with
the

you
never

do
it
anyway
to
which
volland
could
only
reply
well
if
that
s
the
case
then
you
never
should
have
do
what
you
do
but
you
sure
want
the
reward
didn
t
you

weill
and
dimon
descend
on
baltimore
to
pretty
up
the

before

just
a
few
week
away
weill
also
launch
into

he

which
meant
he

technically

up
from

an
arrangement
that

so
too
do
most
of
the

point
or
another

when
they

that

so
smart
but
he
didn
t

and
he
taught
me
one
of
the
most
important
thing
in
my
career
which

only
when

to
the
business

always
make
it

him
toward
the
annual

fowler
remembers
one
particular

meeting
with
weill

dimon
at
the
four

down
with
the
bureaucracy
remembers
calvano
it
be
this
be
gonna
be
just
us
guy
and
girl
and
we
ll
get
it
do
the
right
way
it
be
very
appeal
especially
for
those
who
come
from
american
express
which
be
almost
byzantine
in
its
political
nature
if
you
be
ambitious
yourself
and
you
want
to
do
something
why
not
do
it
with
sandy
early
on

would
be
another

to

over
the
next
year
like
dimon
pearson
be
a
twin

otherwise
you

have
to

bob

what

have
take
a
year
and
although
it
be
exhaust
it
be
also
exhilarate
it
be
great
fun
recall
bob
lipp
i
often
look
back
at
those
few
year
the
like
of
which
i
ve
never
experienced
again
it
be
like
go

without

at
they
make
quick
work
of
commercial
credit
s
balance
sheet
dimon
take
the
lead
when
it
come
to
make
the
number
work
in
early
they
sell
the
company

plus
assumption
of

in

they
stop

in
israel
no
one
be
ever
sure
why
the
company
have
make
these
loan
in
the
first
place
and
curtail
all
business
loan
slowly
but
surely
weill
and
his
team
refocus
the
company
on
its
core
business
of
consumer
finance
and
the
result
show
for
the
full
year
the
company
earn
million
and
have
an
impressive
percent
return
on
equity
the

agency
have
upgraded
the
company
s
debt
rating
from
bb
at
the
time
of
the
takeover
to
a
a
year
later
and
commercial
credit
be
able
to
tap
the
debt
market
to
the
tune
of
million
in
they
kept
go
they
sell
american
credit
indemnity
which
insured
account

for
corporate
client
to
dun
brad

for

weill
do
away
with
perk
for
most
of
the
company
s
management
rank
he
cancel
all
newspaper
subscription
send
out
the
message
that
if
employee
want
to
read
the
wall
street
journal
they
could
pay
for
it
themselves
he
order
all
company
car
to
be
return
or
bought
by
those
use
them
and
he
cancel
a
contract
with
a
plant
service
tell
employee
to
water
their
own
plant
the
core
lending
business
too
need
an
overhaul
once
bob
lipp
get
proper
reporting
system
in
place
weill
saw
that
the
cost
and
incentive
structure
at
the
company
s
lending
branch
be
hamper
profit
growth
he
announce
that
the
poorest
perform
percent
of
the
company
s
branch
would
receive
no
bonus
whatsoever
whereas
the
top
perform
percent
might
receive
percent
of
their
salary
as
a
bonus
believe
it
the
best
way
to
motivate
employee
both
weill
and
dimon
continued
to
utilize
this
carrot
or
stick
method
over
the
year
after
a
while
the
executive
realize
that
with
not
a
single
one
of
them
living
in
baltimore
they
be
not
connect
to
the
company
weill
start
a
drumbeat
of
one
of
us
have
to
move
which
the
team
properly
understood
as
one
of
you
have
to
move
after
some
discussion
all
eye
focus
on
dimon
who
as
the
young
member
of
the
team
have
the
few
root
to
pull
up
because
judy
be
then
pregnant
with
the
couple
s
second
child
it
actually
make
sense
for
dimon
to
bring
his
wife
and
daughter
to
maryland
with
him
he
didn
t
like
be
away
from
them
so
he
be
the
volunteer
the
only
member
of
the
executive
team
to
do
time
as
a
baltimorean
judy
like
many
people
who
have
live
in
new
york
be
use
to
walk
pretty
much
everywhere
she
need
to
go
so
the
couple
move
to
cross
key
baltimore
s
first
plan
community
it
be
really
hard
for
me
to
picture
myself
living
in
a
suburban
environment
she
recall
so
we
found
this
ground
floor
apartment
where
jules
and
i
could
walk
wherever
we
need
to
go
the
only
issue
be
that
everybody
else
be
twice
my
age
jamie
dimon
wasn
t
in
baltimore
to
make
friend
though
he
be
there
to
whip
commercial
credit
into
shape
he
didn
t
much
care
where
he
live

work
with
this
group
of
veteran
executive
dimon
soon
earn
the
nickname
the
kid
but
he
be
a
notable
kid
exceptional
in
his
spongelike
capacity
to
understand
the
intricacy
of
financial
accounting
and
tax
issue
while
equally
adept
at
analyze
the
trade
offs
between
risk
and
return
in
the
company
s
various
business
bob
lipp
be
impressed
at
dimon
s
ability
to
apply
ethical
standard
in
the
gray
area
of
accounting
rule
dimon
also
manage
to
revive
the
company
s
commercial
paper
funding
program
which
have
falter
under
control
data
bring
cost
down
in
the
process
he
also
seem
perennially
a
step
ahead
fowler
consider
him
as
quick
as
a
hiccup
dimon
knew
the
company
s
book
well
than
anyone
else
not
long
after
you
start
talk
he
d
interrupt
you
say
i
know
i
know
i
know
recall
his
longtime
colleague
marge
magner
and
he
usually
do
his
colleague
tolerate
such
impatience
because
of
his
obvious
focus
it
be
also
at
commercial
credit
that
dimon
cement
his
reputation
as
hothead
engage
in
frequent
scream
match
with
weill
the
vitriol
be
not
reserve
just
for
his
bos
indeed
he
challenged
other
executive
as
well
one
executive
remembers
a
senior
committee
meeting
in
which
the
year
old
dimon
stabbed
his
ballpoint
pen
in
the
air
toward
bob
lipp
and
say
bob
you
re
wrong
on
this
all
present
be
dumbstruck
here
be
a
kid
just
a
couple
of
year
out
of
business
school
lecture
a
former
president
of
chemical
bank
weill
say
nothing
and
just
chewed
away
on
his
cigar
from
that
point
we
could
tell
how
tough
he
be
recall
the
executive
and
how
nobody
but
nobody
stood
up
to
him
lipp
doesn
t
recall
the
specific
incident
but
say
he
have
no
problem
with
a
young
jamie
dimon
challenge
him
on
anything
part
of
what
make
dimon
s
temper
tolerable
however
be
that
he
treat
everyone
exactly
the
same
way
he
be
abrasive
and
could
make
you
crazy
recall
magner
but
there
be
always
something
endear
about
him
dimon
for
example
have
no
compunction
about
voice
his
democratic
political
view
in
a
boardroom
full
of
republican
which
include
former
president
gerald
ford
compulsively
chew
the
end
of
ballpoint
pen
dimon
be
a
most
unusual
hybrid
the
accounting
nerd
who
have
expansive
view
on
public
policy
he
be
also
capable
of
the
occasional
outright
power
play
sandy
weill
have
sense
during
the
ipo
road
show
that
dimon
consider
greg
fitz
gerald
an
obstacle
and
it
be
not
long
before
the
obstacle
be
remove
in
the
early
day
of
form
the
company
the
team
have
a
white
board
in
a
conference
room
show
the
company
s
line
of
reporting
one
day
as
a
number
of

around

dimon
walk
into
the
room
wipe
out
all
the
name
under
fitz
gerald
rewrote
them
all
underneath
his
own
name
and
walk
out
nobody
dare
change
it
of
course
say
one
executive
it
be
the
kind
of
move
i
never
would
have
believe
if
i
hadn
t
see
it
with
my
own
eye
shortly
thereafter
fitz
gerald
left
the
company
young
as
he
be

nervous
but
weill
insist
that
scharf
continue
before
long
the
young
man
be
stammer
so
dimon
take
over
answer
weill
s
question
before
long
he
and
weill
be
at
each
other
s
throat
scharf
be
petrify
be
jamie
go
to
get
fire
he
thought
to
himself
what
the
hell
be
go
on
here
and
then
as
quickly
as
it
have
start
the
argument
come
to
a
close
dimon
have
make
one
final
point
to
which
weill
merely
say
oh
ok
i
get
it
and
turn
and
left
the
office
dimon
s
combustible
relationship
with
weill
set
the
tone
for
how
he
dealt
with
colleague
in
the
early
part
of
his
career
because
he
could
be
that
way
with
weill
he
be
that
way
with
everyone
and
this
have
both
positive
and
negative
effect
on
the
positive
side
dimon
never
felt
the
need
to
dance
around
an
issue
he
get
straight
to
the
point
on
the
negative
side
he
fail
to
hone
his
interpersonal
office
skill
because
he
didn
t
have
to
that
s
not
to
say
dimon
be
unfair
in
fact
to
this
day
it
be
his
obsession
with
fairness
that
be
largely
responsible
for
the
loyalty
he
elicits
from
most
people
who
work
for
him
he
can
and
will
fire
people
who
don
t
measure
up
but
it
be
rare
for
senior
executive
work
for
him
to
quit
of
their
own
accord
sandy
and
jamie
be
in
a
constant
state
of
battle
over
their
intellectual
capacity
remembers
bob
lipp
they
also
bet
on
little
thing
sometimes
we
take
the
train
to
baltimore
and
they
d
be
stand
on
the
platform
bet
who
would
be
closer
to
the
door
when
the
train
stop
they
d
bet
about
anything
once
when
weill
claimed
that
the
sun
rise
minute
later
in
baltimore
than
it
do
in
new
york
dimon
counter
that
there
be
only
a
minute
difference
they
bet
on
it
and
in
this
case
dimon
won
their
hypercompetitiveness
seem
to
draw
them
together
rather
than
push
them
apart
at
least
for
a
while
a
decade
later
the
one
upsmanship
become
more
hard
edge
especially
from
dimon
s
end
but
in
their
early
year
together
the
two
men
fed
off
each
other
s
alpha
male
energy
the
dynamic
paid
dividend
as
both
work
harder
as
a
result
dimon
s
confidence
could
be
contagious
when
john
fowler
complain
one
day
that
he
be
make
a
mere
a
year
and
be
fielding
a
job
offer
for
dimon
persuade
him
not
to
jump
ship
wow
that
s
awfully
attractive
he
told
fowler
but
stick
around
stay
with
this
you
ll
be
make
a
million
dollar
a
year
in
five
year
fowler
take
the
advice
and
get
his
payday
everyone
who
have
chosen
to
take
a
bet
on
sandy

would
be
handsomely
reward
building
the
perfect

machine
once
the

weill

to
prove
that
the

more
than
a
lucky
break
by
make
a
splashy
acquisition
or
two
it
turn
out
to

much
more
than
that
he
and
dimon
be
about
to
embark
on
a
decade
of
almost
constant
deal
make
this
suit
dimon
just
fine
jamie
approach
everything
with
total
fury
recall
weill

nothing

an
idea
that
merely
linger
it
be
always
ninety
mile
an
hour
when
i
first
met
him
i
use
to
call
him
the
lawn
mower
he
d
cut
it
all
off
before
realize
that
he
might
have
make
it
a
little
short
then
he
d
say
it
ll
grow
back
let
s
move
on
the
template
be
a
simple
one
run
the
business
conservatively
building
fortress
balance
sheet
that
give
the
wherewithal
to
make
acquisition
during
downturn
when
asset
be
cheap
a
fortress
balance
sheet
be
just
what
it
sound
like
it
consist
of
ample
high
quality
capital
pair
with
a
strong
liquidity
position
that
would
protect
the
firm
from
the
assault
of
an
economic
downturn
while
also
provide
the
ability
to
launch
an
attack
on
weaken
competitor
to
be
an
acquirer
during
boom
time
be
to
be
foolish
to
commit
the
cardinal
sin
of
overpay
but
to
pick
off
distressed
asset
in
a
lousy
economic
climate
that
be
the
stuff
of
the
empire
builder
it
be
also
weill
s
playbook
when
he
built
shearson
from
the
ground
up
over
two
plus
decade
begin
in
weill
hadn
t
invent
this
idea
it
have
be
practice
and
refine
over
the
course
of
century
as
the
jewish
american
financier
bernard
baruch
once
say
buy
straw
hat
in
winter
another
precept
of
weill
s
be
to
add
little
bell
and
whistle
to
his
firm
s
offering
to
make
them
more
competitive
since
most
financial
product
be
commodity
the
trick
be
to
appeal
to
customer
with
something
as
simple
as
a
more
comprehensive
account
statement
if
there
be
no
way
to
offer
a
unique
product
then
have
the
low
cost
delivery
system
be
the
only
way
to
compete
and
a
third
and
final
one
don
t
go
chase
the
flavor
of
the
month
unless
you
actually
know
its
ingredient
just
because
other
people
be
make
money
in
something
don
t
be
tempt
to
follow
suit
unless
you
understand
the
complexity
involve
and
how
they
profit
from
it
the
stock
market
crash
of
october
cut
the
price
of
commercial
credit
stock
in
half
weill
be
initially
shock
along
with
most
everybody
else
but
he
quickly
regain
his
nerve
and
exhort
his
team
not
only
to
buy
even
more
commercial
credit
stock
on
the
cheap
but
also
to
scour
the
financial
landscape
for
an
acquisition
target
the
crash
of
have
not
ushered
in
a
serious
recession
it
have
merely
dealt
the
market
a
psychological
blow
so
this
be
the
perfect
time
to
pick
up
a
distressed
asset
it
have
also
cause
weill
to
rethink
his
old
modus
operandi
of
consolidation
within
a
single
industry
when
he
take
over
commercial
credit
he
write
in
the
real
deal
he
d
assume
that
he
d
merely
buy
more
consumer
finance
company
in
a
drive
toward
consolidation
but
the
crash
have
decimate
the
valuation
of
whole
swath
of
financial
service
company
wall
street

be
particularly
slow
to
recover
give
that
investor
confidence
remain
shaken
he
write
and
before
i
knew
it
i
begin
to
see
chance
for
a
return
to
the
security
business
the
financial

or
megabank
concept
in
other
word
be
not
weill

goal
from
the

it
be
merely
the
result
of
the

s
relentless
opportunism
the

that
would
eventually
become

it
be
an
evolve
organism
that
begin
to
take
shape
in
the
midst
of
a
crisis
the
first
target
be
the
brokerage
ef
hutton
during
his
exile
weill
have
walk
away
from
a
deal
for
that
firm
after
news
of
his
interest
have
sent
its
stock
soar
hutton
be
weaken
by
the
crash
and
weill
found
its
director
keen
to
discus
a
merger
but
he
be
to
be
deny
again
once
word
get
out
that
sandy
weill
be
on
the
scene
a
bidding
war
ensue
weill
have
offer
a
share
but
peter
cohen
at
shearson
carry
the
day
with
a
bid
it
wouldn
t
take
weill
and
dimon
too
long
to
identify
another
target
their
tactical
approach
be
one
they
replicate
again
and
again
the
negotiate
team
be
small
usually
make
up
of
weill
dimon
their
lawyer
kenneth
bialkin
and
arthur
zankel
a
board
member
who
be
one
of
weill
s
old
friend
weill
set
the
target
and
then
dimon
go
after
it
and
brought
it
in
identify
area
of
promising
growth
as
well
as
asset
that
could
be
sell
off
to
shore
up
the
company
s
capital
base
after
a
deal
one
executive
who
work
at
commercial
credit
recall
originally
consider
the
reputation
of
the
two
weill
as
the
maestro
dimon
as
detail
man
simplistic
he
reconsider
that
position
however
when
on
more
than
one
occasion
weill
ask
in
a
meeting
jamie
where
do
we
put
the
decimal
point
here
most
colleague
marvel
at
how
smoothly
the
two
man
tag
team
seem
to
work
when
it
come
time
to
sell
unit
or
division
dimon
often
delegate
to
john
fowler
and
chuck
prince
but
in
make
a
buy
it
be
dimon
from
begin
to
end
one
inherent
risk
of
be
a
serial
acquirer
be
recognize
the
threshold
when
the
conglomerate
becomes
too
complicate
to
manage
properly
the
objective
be
not
just
to
sell
stock
to
wall
street
these
company
sell
real
product
to
real
customer
and
if
they
fail
to
do
that
well
the
whole
thing
would
come
apart
at
the
seam
this
be
something
weill
and
dimon
eventually
have
to
face
though
not
for
quite
some
time

the
commercial
credit
crew
work
harder
over
the
next
decade
than
most
of
its
member
ever
have
for
dimon
that
would
hardly
be
a
difficult
mark
to
set
as
it
be
his
first
real
job
but
for
many
of
the
others
bob
lipp
bob
willumstad
marge
magner
mary
mcdermott
and
the
like
this
be
quite
literally
their
second
or
third
career
and
they
be
pull
all
nighters
as
they
hadn
t
do
since
they
be
youngster
weill
motivate
them
with
equity
but
he
demand
a
commitment
in
return
usually
percent
of
any
executive
s
compensation
be
in
stock
that
vested
over
a
three
year
period
in
what
insider
refer
to
as
the
blood
oath
it
be
understood
that
no
one
be
to
sell
those
share
even
after
they
d
vested
no
one
do
so
until
the
end
of
that
decade
they
be
all
in
it
together
dimon
later
say
that
despite
the
drama
of
all
the
merger
and
acquisition
it
be
weill

the
clash
they
re
very
hard
it
s
not
surprising
that
dimon
feel
this
way
give
his
inability
to
let
the
small
stuff
slide
whereas
sandy
weill
could
easily
switch
his
focus
to
the
next
part
of
his
grand
vision
dimon
always
sweat
the
detail
in
that
way
his

harder

come
to

when
sandy
told
me
i
almost
fell
off
my

dimon
told
a
reporter
at
the
time
in
a
lengthy
handwritten
letter
judy
dimon
assure
weill
that
her

although
he

one
of
the
young

as
well
as
one
of
the
most
powerful

also
adamant
that
this

something
very
very
well
they

but
i
don
t
feel
very
old
either
analyst
understood
the
point
even
if
they
didn
t
entirely
believe
it
fifteen
year
later
weill
give
it
a
different
spin
whatever
gossipmonger
might
have
say
he
write
in
his
autobiography
the
real
deal
i
assume
at
the
time
that
jamie
stood
first
in
line
to
succeed
me
eventually
weill
have
a
peculiar
style
of
mentor
he
regularly
reward
dimon
but
at
the
same
time
he
often
found
subtle
way
to
impede
the
young
man
s
progress
by
force
power
share
arrangement
on
dimon
at
every
turn
after

away
from

lehman
where
he
have
be
cfo
to
be
co
cao
with
dimon
the
contradictory
signal
would
eventually
drive
dimon
out
of
his
mind
but
in
the
early
part
of
the
decade
he
still
held
his
bos
on
a
pedestal
and
take
what
he
be

much
complaint

extremely
sharp

he
could
do
five

through

at
the

of

a
longtime

a

maxim
that
one
of
the
hardest

brought
most
of
the
commercial
credit
team
back
to
new
york
from
baltimore
but
the
next
deal
give
sandy
weill
a
professional
homecoming
before
that
could
happen
though
a
few
piece
of
his
past
have
to
be
reshuffle
in
early
jim
robinson
be
remove
as
chairman
of
american
express
harvey
golub
whom
weill
have
personally
recruit
to
american
express
to
run
id
before
he
d
left
be
make
chairman
and
ceo
of
the
company
robinson
have
come
under
fire
owe
to
the
underperformance
of
american
express
s
brokerage
and
banking
subsidiary
shearson
lehman
brother
since
a
slew
of
mckinsey
consultant
include
jay
mandelbaum
at
one
point
have
be
camped
out
at
shearson
for
two
year
try
to
put
its
house
in
order
to
no
avail
with
the
executive
transition
weill
have
a
revelation
if
there
s
something
that
almost
all
new
ceo
like
to
do
it
s
to
dump
some
underperform
division
right
from
the
get
go
allow
them
to
start
their
tenure
with
a
clean
slate
and
solidly
perform
business
guess
that
golub
might
consider
unload
shearson
weill
call
his
old
friend
and
offer
to
take
both
the
shearson
brokerage
team
and
the
company
s
building
in
tribeca
at
greenwich
street
off
golub
s
hand
over
the
next
few
week
weill
and
dimon
negotiate
with
golub
and
his
team
to
come
to
a
mutually
beneficial
deal
it
be
their
most
complicate
transaction
to
date
as
weill
have
no
interest
in
the
investment
banking
franchise
at
lehman
brother
and
so
they
shear
shear
son
right
out
of
shearson
lehman
even
so
at
a
cost
of
about
billion
it
be
the
large
sale
of
a
brokerage
in
history
to
that
point
both
weill
and
dimon
remain
uncomfortable
take
on
business
that
have
balance
sheet
too
heavily
expose
to
the
gyration
of
the
capital
market
shearson
with
its
broker
have
very
little
exposure
lehman
be
another
matter
entirely

technically
in

off
the

from

there
be
never
any

about
confidential
information
as
few
people
can
decipher

during
a

of
which
there
be
very

when
you

for

recall
dimon
ask

ego
how
many

us
think
it
necessary
to
collect

yet
dimon
seem
to
have
understood
that

that
the

have
experienced
the
same
kind
of
revelation
as
dimon
have
a
decade
previously
he
appreciate
the
thrill
of
investment
banking
but
he
also
saw
that
the
job
be
essentially
that
of
an
agent
help
others
figure
out
what
to
do
with
their
money
his
brief
experience
at

and

secure
an
interview
with

and
soon
land
a

reporting
to
mandelbaum
dimon
also
do
an
old
friend
a
big
favor
at
the
time
he
have
kept
in
touch
with
jeremy
paul
since
their
day
at
browning
and
saw
his
friend
once
or
twice
a
year
with
two
young
child
paul
have
land
a
gig
as
a

professor
at

strap
for

on
his
professor
s
salary
paul
be
concerned
about
pay
the
bill
if
his
wife
didn
t
land
a
job
once
she
finish
up
at
yale
there
have
be
discussion
at
primer
ica
about
dimon
himself
move
to
hartford
to
get
more
involve
at
traveler
and
he
concoct
the
idea
that
paul
take
a
sabbatical
and
join
the
company
as
his
assistant
the
purchase
of
shearson
make
that
idea
unfeasible
however
as
everyone
understood
that
dimon
would
be
well
utilized
in
new
york
but
they
found
a
solution
bob
lipp
agree
to
hire
paul
as
his
assistant
in
hartford
before
he
report
to
lipp
however
paul
do
get
to
shadow
dimon
at
smith
barney
for
two
week
he
be
shock
by
the
capability
of
his
longtime
friend
if
dimon
have
meeting
a
day
with
six
people
at
each
meeting
come
in
to
brief
him
on
topic
x
y
or
z
paul
watch
in
awe
as
it
become
painfully
clear
that
dimon
invariably
knew
more
about
every
topic
than
anyone
else
in
the
room
include
those
present
dimon
also
give
paul
a
piece
of
advice
he
didn
t
quite
understand
at
the
time
but
have
since
come
to
appreciate
this
might
be
counterintuitive
for
you
dimon
say
but
it
s
more
important
to
do
thing
and
get
eight
of
them
right
than
to
do
five
and
get
them
all
right
even
as
he
be
building
his
own
team
from
the
ground
up
dimon
be
confront
with
a
serious
culture

although
many

people
knew
one

you

for
all
its

they

to
do
more
of
the
same
at
smith
barney
for
a
time
it
be
a
believable
proposition
morgan
stanley
s
chairman
dick
fisher
at
least
must
have
have
reason
to
second
guess
green
hill
s
demotion
in
the
month
ahead
on
one
occasion
when
the

the
response
fisher
ask
if
he
knew
how
to
get
there
the
ceo
s
deadpan
reply
i
presume
i
go
down
the
elevator
and
follow
the
groove
and
at
first
dimon
try
to
be
as
accommodate
as
he
could
be
whereas
smith
barney
have
become
accustom
to
operating
on
a
tighter
budget
than
most
investment
bank
its
people
flew
coach
the
morgan
stanley
people
demand
the
same
perquisite
they
have
receive
in
their
old
job
personal
refrigerator
orthopedic
chair
town
car
to
take
them
home
at
p
m
instead
of
at
smith
barney
s
p
m
cutoff
don
t
worry
about
it
dimon
told
those
who
be
wonder
about
the
double
standard
even
though
he
be
worry
about
it
himself
in
a
serious
miscalculation
however
greenhill
lose
the
support
of
one
potential
ally
from
the
get
go
the
head
of
capital
market
steve
black
concerned
about
his
friend
black
s
reaction
to
greenhill
s
hire
dimon
have
personally
assure
black
that
his
position
at
the
firm
be
safe
he
be
go
to
be
make
a
vice
chairman
of
smith
barney
shearson
along
with
lessin
black
would
run
all
of
smith
barney
s
capital
market
business
and
report
to
greenhill
just
a
few
day
later
however
greenhill
inform
black
that
he
plan
to
have
him
oversee
only
the
equity
side
of
the
business
and
that
he
be
bring
in
another
morgan
stanley
veteran
jack
lyness
to
run
fix
income
capital
market
also
lyness
be
go
to
report
straight
to
greenhill
not
to
black
insult
black
call
dimon
and
threaten
to
quit
along
with
his
deputy
jim
boshart
complete
the
circle
dimon
then
call
greenhill
and
read
him
the
riot
act
greenhill
still
get
his
way
about
hire
lyness
but
it
be
an
inauspicious
start
before
he
d
even
begin
work
he
d
run
up
against
the
phenomenon
know
as
jamie
dimon
it
be
the
first
time
but
it
would
not
be
the
last
greenhill
have
demand
in
his
negotiation
with
weill
and
dimon
that
he
be
give
the
entirety
of
smith
barney
shearson
to
run
not
just
the
investment
banking
division
weill
agree
but
as
an
insurance
policy
encourage
dimon
to
spend
as
much
time
as
possible
keep
an
eye
on
operation
it
wasn
t
long
before
dimon
conclude
that
greenhill
be
spending
excessive
sum
on
people
who
weren
t
worth
the
price
he
regularly
double
morgan
stanley
banker
pay
in
order
to
lure
them
to
the
firm
in
addition
to
give
them
substantial
signing
bonus
more
worrisome
though
be
the
grow
anger
among
the
unit
s
gigantic
brokerage
force
about
the
new
crowd
s
divert
a
disproportionate
amount
of
the
company
s
profit
greenhill
a
career
investment
banker
be
focus
merely
on
the
top
line
bring
in
revenue
while
dimon
be
as
usual
focus
on
the
bottom
line
the
return
on
shareholder
equity
and
thus
the
two
men
be
on
an
inevitable
collision
course
bad
it
seem
that
the
institutional
arrogance
breed
at
morgan
stanley
prevent
the
new
hire
from
adapt
to
their
new
organization
instead
of
seek
any
way
to
put
together
a
blend
culture
they
built
a
mini
morgan
stanley
within
smith
barney
lessin
in
particular
surprised
the
old
guard
with
his
presumption
he
saw
himself
as
equal
to
dimon
a
view
share
by
precisely
no
one
one
jarring
difference
lessin
be
prone
to
walk
around
the
office
with
no
shoe
on
a
habit
that
would
be
inconceivable
to
dimon
in
any
event
the
question
become
moot
shortly
thereafter
when
lessin
suffer
a
stroke
and
be
force
to
downsize
his
role
at
the
firm
greenhill
might
have
work
out
if
he
have
be
able
to
deliver
where
it
matter
with
market
share
and
on
the
bottom
line
yes
he
be
throw
around
huge
sum
of
money
but
if
he
succeed
in
building
an
investment
banking
franchise
the
think
go
everybody
would
come
out
ahead
and
he
start
off
with
a
bang
land
an
advisory
role
on
the
billion
takeover
of
paramount
by

in
that
brought
the

however
it
be
down
to

and
the
grumble
about
greenhill
s
spending
grow
louder
dimon
could
tolerate
weill
s
get
all
the
credit
in
the
press
for
the
company
s
success
but
what
he
could
not
countenance
be
be
saddle
with
partner
who
make
a
job
he
could
easily
have
do
himself
a
little
more
difficult
coworkers
come
to
see
in
dimon
a
man
both
impatient
to
get
the
job
do
and
able
to
relax
when
the
time
be
right
he
worried
a
lot
about
substance
not
so
much
about
form
recall
plumeri
he
always
use
to
say
i
just
need
to
know
the
fact
i
don
t
want
to
hear
some
long
story
just
give
me
the
fact
and
then
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
dimon
might
invite
a
few
junior
analyst
into
his
office
on
the
thirty
ninth
floor
of
greenwich
street
to
share
a
nice
bottle
of
wine
he
be
still
only
in
his
mid
thirty

at
the
same
time
that
he
be
engage
in
the
audacious
experiment
with
greenhill
weill
decide
that
the
time
might
be
right
to
propose
to
ed
budd
at
traveler
that
they
fold
the
remain
percent
of
the
insurance
company
into
primerica
in
addition
to
consolidate
control
of
traveler
operation
which
would
allow
the
primerica
team
to
truly
do
a
number
on
its
finance
instead
of
merely
exert
influence
at
the
board
level
there
be
also
the
lure
of
the
traveler
name
and
the
company
s
well
know
logo
its
red
umbrella
although
the
primerica
people
have
help
ed
budd
and
the
traveler
team
whittle
down
the
insurance
company
s
real
estate
exposure
over
the
past
year
weill
sense
that
budd
be
sick
of
head
the
still
sluggish
company
and
would
be
ready
to
do
a
deal
if

we

have
a
great

in
the
end
it
didn

really
work
out

dimon
wouldn
t
need
to
fire
plumeri
when
they
d
finally
have
enough
greenhill
and
weill
call
plumeri
into

in
the
summer
of
and
told
him
he
be
be
make
a
vice
chairman
of

from
that
point
on

i
never
ask
him

plumeri
might
have
suspect
he
be
be
zarbed
he
might
have
be
but
weill
have
another
idea
realize
that
the
company
s
insurance
business
could
use
a
hot
blood
leader
like
the
exile

he
put
plumeri
in
charge
of
oversee

the
medium
come
to
the
conclusion
that
yet
another
addition
to

portfolio
make
it
certain
he
be
be

as

get
plenty
of
time
and
that
s
something
he
need
to
decide
when
the
time
be
right
he
say
if
it
s
not
me
then
so
be
it
two
year
into
the
greenhill
experiment
at
smith
barney
it
be
become
painfully
clear
to
everyone
involve
that
thing
weren
t
work
out
even
though
weill
have
give
dimon
official
power
in

it
have
prove

to

in
hong

and
beijing
the
year
before
have
be
an
expensive
disaster
after
initial
success
greenhill
s
team
prove
largely
incapable
of

a
meaningful
number
of
their
old
client
from
morgan
stanley
investment
banking
be
all
about

and
the
idea
that
they
d
raid
not
only
morgan
stanley
s
personnel
but
also
its
client
list
have
be
a
large
reason
for
hire
greenhill
in
the
first
place
greenhill
and
dimon
be
also
more
often
than
not
work
at
cross
purpose
the
big
spender
and
the
tightwad
be
natural
adversary
even
as
dimon
s
viselike
grip
on

kept
the

you

that

with

spending
that
do

certainly
be
not
while
greenhill
continued
to

around
the

his
inability

deliver
compelling
result
at

recall
one
colleague
he

ineffective
but
cleaning
up

remain
a

player
in

indeed
over
the

with
anyone
with

i
share
a
close

it
amount
to

personal
threat
i
understood
the
legitimacy
of
many
of

it
bother
me
that
he
couldn

operate
more
collegially
even
so
weill
could
see
for
himself
that
the
result
be
not
quite
what
he
have
hop
by
the
end
of
the

of

to
apologize
to
the

for
the

we
make

sorry
he
say
to
the
brokerage

let

would
suggest
that
greenhill
s
failure
to
take

to
great
height
be
an
issue
more

not

view
the

as
a
critical
turn

in
his

with
weill

come
to
see
the

as
an
unforgivable
transgression
even
if
dimon
obviously
have
nothing
to

with

make

about

in
the

he
be
take
aback
by
the
suggestion
from
a

imply
that

not
weill

the
central
figure

at

actually

exactly
that
he

califano
add
that
dimon
be
more
and
more
the
drive
force
at

as
a
whole
it
seem
to
many
around
weill
that
his
insecurity
kick
in
and
he
increasingly
come
to
view
dimon
as
a
threat
not
an
ally
weill
have
never
lose
and
would
never
lose
the
joy
of
what
one
former
colleague
call
see
his
face
on
the
cover
of
fortune
even
in
retirement
his
office
be
a
shrine
to
the
cult
of
sandy
weill
corporate
executive
and
philanthropist
several
people
told
dimon
that
the
story
be
go
to
cause
him
problem
they
be
right
weill
barge
into
a
meeting
the
next
day
who
the
fuck
told
joe
califano
to
say
that
and
who
chose
that
photo
still
dimon
initially
fail
to
recognize
the
shift
in
his
bos
s
perspective
i
be
still
a
little
bit
of
a
kid
he
recall
weill
s
pr
people
orchestrate
it
he
knew
about
it
he
knew
well
and
i
didn
t
but
i
don
t
think
it
be
really
about
the
picture
he
look
more
like
a
proud
father
in
it
than
anything
else
it
be
about
califano
s
quote
all
of
a
sudden
there
be
the
question
be
jamie
really
run
this
place
i
think
that
be
what
get
to
him
the
fact
that
the
two
men
begin
to
directly
repudiate
the
press
s
characterization
of
a
father
son
relationship
be
far
evidence
of
the
strain
dimon
pointedly
told
the
new
york
time
in
july
i
ve
get
my
own
father
thank
you
on
the
other
hand
they
give
so
many
interview
that
it
could
also
have
be
a
natural
reaction
to
be
confront
with
the
same
pat
simplication
once
too
often
if
he
d
be
more
inclined
to
pay
well
attention
dimon
would
have
notice
grow
angst
emanate
from
the
ceo
s
office
weill
come
to
believe
that
dimon
be
deliberately
keep
him
out
of
the
loop
at
smith
barney
during
this
time
on
one
occasion
weill
later
write
when
he
suggest
that
the
company
purchase
aetna
s
property
casualty
business
in
late
dimon
say
in
front
of
the
room
you
re
make
a
mistake
you
sandy
what
some
have
admire
as
youthful
self
confidence
now
take
on
a
note
of
arrogance
he
d
always
respect
his
own
intellect
one
former
colleague
recall
and
reasonably
so
but
this
be
something
else
entirely
the
antithesis
of
the
smooth
backroom
operator
dimon
come
to
be
see
by
some
colleague
as
more
brutish
than
brilliant
although
he
and
weill
have
be
swear
at
each
other
since
baltimore
dimon
grow
increasingly
comfortable
challenge
his
bos
and
the
result
fight
unnerved
a
number
of
colleague
whether
or
not
he
knew
it
he
might
have
be
unconsciously
expedite
his
own
exit
from
the
firm
he
would
find
it
extraordinarily
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
resign
from
the
firm
he
help
build
but
the
grow
realization
that
sandy
weill
wasn
t
go
anywhere
anytime
soon
put
the
ambitious
dimon
in
a
bind
judy
dimon
recall
think
she
wouldn
t
have
mind
if
her
husband
get
a
new
job
consider
the
stress
he
be
bring
home
with
him
each
day
dimon
though
chose
to
continue
play
with
fire
ignore
what
have
happen
a
decade
earlier
when
george
vonder
linden
ask
weill
to
stay
away
from
the
smith
barney
meeting
in
pebble
beach
dimon
begin
to
do
exactly
the
same
thing
weill
write
in
the
real
deal
that
he
hit
the
roof
when
dimon
s
lieutenant
charlie
scharf
told
him
that
he
be
not
authorize
to
provide
weill
with
certain
information
scharf
himself
have
no
recollection
of
this
and
have
call
the
idea
that
he
would
try
to
withhold
information
from
weill
preposterous
dimon
be
risk
inflame
weill
s
still
simmer
anger
over
have
be
frozen
out
of
shearson
in
the
s
by
peter
cohen
weill
go
on
to
write
in
the
real
deal
that
dimon
s
mafia
be
stoke
the
young
man
s
ego
that
black
boshart
glucksman
scharf
and
others
be
constantly
tell
dimon
he
be
well
equip
than
weill
himself
to
run
traveler
in
an
attempt
to
finally
address
the
issue
head
on
weill
invite
dimon
and
judy
to
have
lunch
with
him
and
joan
during
a
company
off
site
in
early
at
the
dorado
beach
hotel
in
puerto
rico
weill
later
write
that
after
plead
with
dimon
to
stop
cut
him
out
of
the
information
loop
he
be
shock
by
judy
dimon
s
response
but
sandy
you
re
not
give
jamie
enough
credit
she
say
accord
to
weill
s
retell
he
s
be
work
incredibly
hard
and
you
don
t
appreciate
him
he
doesn
t
even
own
as
much
stock
as
you
and
so
two
large
ego
collide
with
full
force
weill
later
write
of
his
surprise
that
his
junior
partner
have
somehow
come
to
see
himself
as
my
equal
in
a
remarkable
example
of
the
pot
call
the
kettle
black
he
add
it
have
become
clear
that
jamie
s
self
image
have
rush
ahead
unchecked
to
the
point
of
fantasy
weill
seem
to
be
talk
as
if
dimon
be
still
an
year
old
summer
intern
just
to
make
thing
painfully
clear
that
day
in
puerto
rico
he
add
one
final
patronize
chastisement
for
the
young
man
you
need
to
behave
if
you
do
all
of
this
can
be
yours
one
day
judy
dimon
call
the
claim
that
she
would
suggest
dimon
and
weill
deserve
equal
stock
onwership
in
the
company
ridiculous
what
she
do
admit
however
be
feel
like
a
referee
between
the
two
men
explain
how
weill
felt
to
dimon
and
how
dimon
felt
to
weill
what
she
try
to
explain
to
weill
she
recall
be
that
her
husband
be
under
extreme
pressure
the
situation
be
take
a
huge
toll
on
jamie
she
say
and
by
the
end
everyone
be
upset
with
each
other
and
for
what

at
that
time
sandy

son
marc

the

chief
investment
officer
in

protective
of
marc
as
he
have
be
with
his
own
brother
in
high
school
help
the
young
weill
navigate
the
razor
sharp
shoal
of

politics
in

welcome
weill
s
daughter
jessica
bibliowicz
to
smith

vice
president
in
charge
of
sale
and
marketing
in
the
company
s
billion
mutual

bibliowicz
would
report
to

not
to
her
father
she
have
previously
work
at
prudential
mutual
fund
for
two
year
and
in

before
that
in
january
dimon

bibliowicz
chairman
of
the

s
mutual

operation
then
the
ninth
large
in
the

he
d
even
push
her
ahead
of
a
candidate
favor
by
jeff
lane
the
company
s
head
of
asset
management
take
some
political
heat
in
the
process
in
reality
bibliowicz
ran
only
mutual
fund
sale
a
department
with
a
mere
people
despite
the
loftiness
of
the
title
she
didn
t
oversee
money
management
operation
or
finance
for
the
fund
group
dimon
and
bibliowicz
have
be
friend
since
childhood
but
their
relationship
begin
to
fray
the
next
year
when
dimon
push
for
the
company
to
sell
no
load
mutual
fund
in
response
to
the
success
of
vanguard
and
other
no
load
fund
company
bibliowicz
resist
the
idea
argue
that
the
company
should
stick
to
its
own
internal
fund
broker
be
far
more
motivate
to
sell
them
after
all
because
of
the
commission
and
weill
himself
side
with
her
in
discussion
on
the
subject
dimon
eventually
won
the
debate
and
in
july
smith
barney
be
the
first
wall
street
broker
to
sell
no
load
fund
in
the
end
the
move
prove
to
have
be
a
smart
one
in
august
the
new
york
time
picked
up
on
the
tension
which
bibliowicz
call
perceive
and
not
a
conflict
whatever
the
case
there
be
a
conflict
soon
enough
dimon
become
convince
that
bibliowicz
s
strength
be
restrict
to
soft
skill
like
marketing
and
that
she
lack
a
thorough
enough
understand
of
the
number
of
the
business
he
begin
to
criticize
her
openly
alienate
her
and
irritate
weill
at
least
some
of
the
result
seem
to
support
his
claim
in
for
example
smith
barney
s
mutual
fund
division
brought
in
just
million
in
net
new
asset
compare
with
billion
at
merrill
lynch
soon
too
lane
found
himself
in
dimon
s
crosshairs
with
dimon
repeatedly
call
for
his
reassignment
weill
ultimately
agree
but
at
the
same
time
suggest
bibliowicz
as
a
candidate
to
be
lane
s
replacement
dimon
vetoed
the
idea
say
she
be
not
yet
qualify
after
some
deliberation
he
instead
promote
robert
druskin
the
onetime
chief
financial
officer
of
shearson
lehman
brother
and
later
co
cao
of
smith
barney
shearson
druskin
have
know
weill
since
when
he
join
shearson
hammill
in
the
management
training
program
so
weill
could
hardly
call
the
choice
inappropriate
still
it
rankle
and
not
long
afterward
in
february
dimon
again
subject
bibliowicz
to
what
weill
regard
as
ignominy
dimon

include
smith
barney

and
exclude
bibliowicz
weill

felt
that
this
be
a
message
direct
squarely
at
her
a
woman
yes
but
not
you
guggenheimer
it
should
be
point
out
manage
hundred
of
people
compare
with
bibliowicz
s
she
be
also
a
top
shelf

mind
who
serve
as
one
of
dimon
s
closest
adviser
at
three
different
company
before
her
premature
death
from
cancer
in
from
weill
s
perspective
it
be
an
unforgivable
slight
his
reaction
be
near
hysteria
it
be
a
stagger
misapprehension
on
weill
s
part
consider
that
there
be
numerous
people
within
the
company
who
deserve
such
a
spot
more
than
his
daughter
weill
be
also
upset
that
dimon
do
not
inform
bibliowicz
personally
even
though
she
do
not
technically
report
to
dimon
the
final
irreconcilable
breach
in
the
relationship
come
when
dimon
actually
accede
to
bibliowicz
s
ambition
when
she
ask
him
how
she
could
get
ahead
in
the

he
ask
what
she
aspire

one
day
she
reply
dimon
told
her
that
if
that
be
ever
go
to
happen
she
need
experience
in
the
retail
side
of
the
business
he
then
call
mike
panitch
who
oversaw
the
retail
branch
and
ask
him
to
find
a
spot
for
bibliowicz
to
learn
the
rope
panitch
initially
reply
that
he
would
offer
the
bos
s
daughter
a
single
smith
barney
branch
dimon
balk
and
ask
panitch
to
put
her
in
charge
of
one
of
the
company
s
four
division
east
midwest
southwest
or
west
panitch
offer
her
california
with
the
rationale
that
the
other
three
state
in
the
west
division
nevada
montana
and
idaho
would
add
too
much
travel
and
too
many
headache
for
someone
settle
into
a
new
position
and
assign
the
other
state
to
another
division
head
dimon
sign
off
on
the
arrangement
think
that
it
wouldn
t
be
a
comedown
for
bibliowicz
because
california
have
or
so
broker
out
of
the
for
the
four
state
combine
he
be
wrong
bibliowicz
felt
slight
weill
explode
when
he
found
out
you
insult
her
he
rag
weill
beseech
dimon
to
reach
out
to
bibliowicz
and
somehow
make
thing
right
for
fear
that
she
be
about
the
leave
the
company
and
to
his
recollection
dimon
agree
to
do
so
then
after
return
from
a
two
week
vacation
in
france
weill
found
to
his
displeasure
that
dimon
have
do
no
such
thing
and
his
daughter
have
decide
to
resign
in
the
midst
of
it
all
the
traveler
group
reach
another
milestone
in
march
the
stock
be
add
to
the
dow
index
but
weill
for
once
be
in
no
mood
to
celebrate
dimon
told
bibliowicz
she
be
do
the
right
thing
honestly
jessica
you
re
not
go
to
be
treat
properly
around
here
anymore
he
say
not
everyone
be
tell
you
the
truth
not
everyone
be
tell
your
father
the
truth
he
s
gotten
too
involve
you
need
your
own
life
outside
this
company
when
weill
chose
to
tell
reporter
that
he
have
know
nothing
of
the
issue
dimon
be
shock
that
be
the
first
time
i
saw
him
not
be
completely
honest
with
the
press
he
recall
when
dimon
s
friend
from
harvard
business
school
stephen
burke
who
have
go
on
to
work
at
abc
read
in
the
wall
street
journal
about
bibliowicz
s
departure
he
call
dimon
jamie
do
you
miss
the
class
at
harvard
when
they
say
you
never
fire
the
bos
s
daughter
he
ask
after
a
fifteen
second
pause
dimon
reply
i
have
to
tell
her
she
wasn
t
go
to
get
a
job
she
want
she
didn
t
like
it
and
she
left
the
company
i
couldn
t
do
something
i
didn
t
feel
be
right
others
thought
dimon
have
place
inordinate
importance
on
his
own
great
strength
analysis
of
financials
and
overlook
the
fact
that
bibliowicz
be
indeed
a
marketing
talent
but
in
jamie
s
mind
it
would
have
be
a
compromise
that
he
risk
lose
credibility
with
his
own
people
recall
bob
willumstad
if
it
be
me
i
be
guess
i
would
probably
have
found
a
way
to
make
that
compromise
it
wasn
t
like
she
be
incompetent
accord
to
monica
langley
a
member
of
traveler
board
arthur
zankel
also
thought
dimon
have
lose
sight
of
pragmatism
at
a
crucial
moment
in
his
relationship
with
sandy
weill
this
isn
t
your
fine
hour
zankel
told
dimon
it
be
your
prerogative
as
smith
barney
president
to
pick
your
own
asset
chief
last
year
but
you
could
have
put
jess
on
the
executive
committee
as
businessmen
we
all
have
to
live
with
this
stuff
occasionally
most
observer
blame
weill
though
for
put
dimon
in
an
untenable
position
if
dimon
have
promote
bibliowicz
as
fast
as
she
d
want
it
would
look
have
look
as
though
he
be
suck
up
to
the
bos
when
he
didn
t
the
bos
become
mad
but
that
be
classic
weill
despite
his
well
deserve
reputation
as
a
visionary
he
have
blind
spot
when
it
come
to
what
he
want
bibliowicz
later
told
the
new
york
time
magazine
that
her
leave
have
more
to
do
with
her
father
than
with
dimon
i
couldn
t
be
open
with
him
because
i
have
to
go
through
channel
she
say
i
didn
t
leave
because
of
jamie
dimon
too
deny
any
irreparable
damage
sure
we
disagreed
but
we
work
it
through
he
told
a
reporter
she
be
a
friend
before
she
get
here
she
be
a
friend
while
she
be
here
and
she
s
a
friend
now
his
relationship
with
weill
however
have
just
slip
down
another
notch
writes
monica
langley
you
drove
her
out
weill
accuse
the
young
man
it
might
be
the
right
thing
for
your
daughter
and
the
company
be
dimon
s
curt
response
when
ask
by
reporter
whether
jamie
have
thrown
his
status
as
heir
apparent
into
doubt
weill
be
push
to
even
great
height
of
annoyance
i
have
never
make
it
clear
to
anybody
that
jamie
be
my
successor
he
say
i
have
no
plan
to
leave
this
company
in
august
weill
hire
thomas
jones
from
the
asset
manager
tiaa
cref
and
put
him
in
charge
of
the
company
s
asset
management
business
weill
have
strip
this
unit
out
of
the
smith
barney
infrastructure
and
make
it
a
separate
division
reporting
directly
to
him
when
the
wall
street
journal
ask
if
this
be
a
retaliatory
move
weill
deny
it
if
i
want
to
retaliate
i
would
really
retaliate
he
say
year
later
weill
still
stew
over
how
dimon
handle
the
situation
i
ve
say
this
to
him
in
the
past
and
he
doesn
t
like
me
to
say
it
recall
weill
i
think
jamie
built
terrific
loyalty
from
some
people
and
developed
a
group
of
people
who
he
really
have
great
relationship
with
others
bumped
into
that
and
those
that
bumped
into
that
their
fate
be
not
great
it
be
amaze
that
when
two
men
join
force
in
a
display
of
empire
building
for
the
age
their
relationship
start
to
come
undone
over
nepotism
what
s
more
amaze
be
that
each
man
have
a
critical
shortcoming
that
do
not
allow
him
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
situation
weill
could
be
so
single
mind
about
his
own
need
and
wish
that
he
fail
to
consider
the
position
he
put
others
in
and
dimon
ever
the
moralist
could
not
bring
himself
to
bend
in
the
one
instance
that
nearly
anyone
would
have
give
him
a
pas
on
on
the
other
hand
maybe
he
be
look
over
his
shoulder
if
you
have
an
inkling
that
you
re
about
to
engage
in
a
power
struggle
with
your
bos
it
s
probably
smart
not
to
promote
his
kid
bibliowicz
land
a
job
as
president
of
john
a
levin

later

in
the
way
of

the
combination
of
the
two
firm
fledgling

would
make

they

salomon

position
as
the

s
strong
player
in

would
be

addition
to

in

on
the

such

cherished

in
the
first
place
he
would
be
buying
a

on
an
upswing
a
more
characteristic
approach
would
have
be
to

when

have

not
when
buffett
be
look
to
sell
most
glare
though
be
the
notion
that
weill

even
consider
buying
a

with
a

something

entirely
a

antithetical
to

these

million
in
a

day
a
botch
risk
arbitrage
trade
have
recently
cost
salomon
just
that
salomon
in
fact
be
a
big
player
in
the
emerge
realm
of
derivative
trading
and
it
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
get
a
real
fix
on
the
attendant
risk
of
that
business
some
month
earlier
in
fact
weill
himself
have
refer
to
salomon
s
trading
outfit
as
a
casino
and
now
here
he
be
think
of
buying
that
casino
outright
sandy
weill
it
can
be
argue
be
somewhat
cavalier
in
his
choice
of
salomon
as
the
investment
bank
that
would
take
traveler
to
the
next
level
building
a
top
tier
investment
bank
be
more
difficult
than
merely
make
a
turnkey
purchase
finally
there
be
the
issue
of
culture
salomon
s
big
swing
dick
have
be
lampoon
in
tom

michael
lewis

both
book
have
paint
a
culture
in
which
the
client
be
view
more
as
prey
than
partner
and
the
treasury
bond
scandal
have
reveal
a
moral
vacuum
at
the
top
level
of
the
firm
weill
and
dimon
have
only
recently
rid
themselves
of
the
overweening
personality
of
greenhill
and
lessin
in
salomon
they
be
quite
possibly
buying
an
entire
firm
of
such
character
but
sandy
weill
be
nothing
if
not
an
opportunist
and
spur
in
part
by
the
failure
of
the
j
p
morgan
deal
he
press
ahead
in
his
quest
for
salomon
figure
he
could
solve
the
in
house
problem
once
he
get
his
hand
on
the
firm
after
a
few
week
of
due
diligence
he
push
the
board
and
audit
committee
toward
a
deal
dimon
the
board
member
joe
wright
recall
be
inclined
toward
the
deal
as
well
although
by
his
very
nature
he
be
more
focus
on
the
risk
they
d
be
take
and
there
be
no
question
that
this
be
a
departure
from
their
plain
vanilla
heritage
plain
vanilla
be
just
fine
with
jamie
dimon
a
business
doesn
t
have
to
be
sexy
to
get
him
excite
it
just
need
to
be
reliable
profitable
and
grow
good
time
make
for
good
result
dimon
knew
even
if
a
company
wasn
t
on
the
perfect
path
but
if
the
good
time
be
to
end
salomon
s
enormous
risk
pose
a
threat
to
traveler
overall
health
awareness
of
any
potential
downside
be
one
of
dimon
s
most
ingrain
character
trait
and
although
he
eventually
come
around
to
the
merit
of
the
deal
he
obsess
over
its
risk
much
more
than
weill
this
be
not
to
say
that
dimon
be
risk
averse
but
he
be
a
number
man
to
the
core
and
he
need
to
able
to
calculate
as
best
he
could
what
the
risk
be
before
he
could
be
comfortable
take
it
on
warren
buffett
like
the
idea
of
a
deal
with
traveler
maughan
have
be
a
sensible
choice
to
run
salomon
because
in
he
d
be
in
the
firm
s
tokyo
office
and
be
untainted
by
the
trading
scandal
but
maughan
be
incapable
of
the
powerful
leadership
that
buffett
sense
weill
and
dimon
could
provide
salomon
rife
with
fiefdom
have
resist
maughan
s
effort
at
wholesale
change
a
principled
attempt
on
his
part
to
tie
compensation
more
closely
to
performance
have
blown
up
in
his
face
but
both
weill
and
dimon
be
by
that
point
legendary
for
their
intolerance
of
fiefdom
and
buffett
saw
an
opportunity
to
finally
put
the
place
right
after
just
a
month
of
negotiation
a
deal
be
struck
on
september
it
be
announce
that
traveler
be
buying
salomon
brother
for
billion
the
market
read
it
as
a
good
deal
for
buffett
and
salomon
send
salomon
s
share
up
several
point
but
the
judgment
be
different
when
it
come
to
traveler
investor
wonder
whether
weill
and
dimon
understood
the
kind
of
risk
they
be
take
on
with
the
fast
and
loose
culture
of
salomon
traveler
fell
percent
buffett
write
a
note
which
be
include
in
the
press
release
for
the
deal
praise
weill
for
show
genius
in
create
huge
value
for
his
shareholder
a
fact
many
observer
point
to
while
second
guess
the
rationale
for
the
deal
itself
it
be
know
that
weill
disliked
arbitrage
so
what
be
he
do
buying
a
firm
that
live
and
breathe
on
just
that
do
he
just
want
to
do
a

with
buffett
to
show
he
be
now
operating
in
the
high

he
d
be
deny
the
chance
more
than
year
before
with
the
fireman

and
it
appear
that
he
wasn

go
to
let
the
opportunity
pas
him
by
again
sandy
spent
nine
billion
dollar
to
get
a
piece
of
paper
from
warren
buffett
say
what
a
great

he
be
an

later
told
the

roger
lowenstein
he
be

around
show
it
to
people
like

still
the

at

in

the

nothing
to

the

need
another
one
jamie
dimon
also
have
a
new
bone
to
pick
with

although
he
d

since
greenhill

departure
the
salomon

brought
deryck
maughan
along
with

that
in

with

weill
have

that
dimon
would
have
complete
control
but
now
with
the

do
weill
refuse
to
budge
on
the

weill
later

that
he
consider
the
co

arrangement
an
insurance
policy
against
his
deteriorate
relationship
with
dimon
he
may
actually
believe
that
but
from
dimon
s
perspective
it
look
more
like
another
way
that
weill
after
elevate
him
to
the
level
of
a
near
equal
seem
intent
on
undermine
him

he
would
fire

be
complete
to
view
maughan
now
as
the
answer
to
his
problem
be
a
stun
about

dimon

not
the
only
one
who
thought
he
be
caught
in
a
groundhog
day
nightmare
the
financial
press
jumped
on
the
issue
ask
maughan
on
the

of

how
he

out
of

the

to

the

it
be

to
see
how

would
accept
anything
less

in
raw

weill
note
that

the

he
saw
the

before
most
of

a
leg
up
in

in
this
he

the

nothing

the

stumble
in

big
way
ten
year
before
for

it
have
endure
the
large
loss
in
corporate
history
as
a
result
of
the
latin
american
debt
crisis
word
have
gotten
out
that
reed
have
recently
spoken
to
harvey
golub
at
american
express
about
combine
the
two
firm
and
although
nothing
come
of
the
discussion
the
episode
show
an
openness
that
weill
found
encourage
in
december
when
weill
call
reed
to
suggest
that
they
get
together
for
a
chat
reed
propose
meeting
in
washington
on
february
when
they
would
both
be
attend
a
business
council
meeting
of
prominent
ceo
reed
didn
t
quite
know
what
he
be
in
for
when
he
knock
on
weill
s
hotel
door
at
p
m
he
thought
weill
be
go
to
ask
him
to
spend
for
a
table
at
a
charity
dinner
or
something
of
that
sort
instead
weill
have
his
sale
pitch
all
ready
to
go
reed
be
barely
through
the
door
when
weill
launch
into
his
vision
of
a
merger
of
equal
a
combination
of
the
two
firm
that
would
sit
powerfully
atop
the
financial
world
he
propose
share
the
leadership
role
as
co
ceo
and
splitting
the
board
with
director
from
both
company
reed
do
not
reject
the
idea
out
of
hand
and
the
next
morning
at
weill
be
on
the
phone
with
dimon
monica
langley
recount
their
conversation
you
won
t
believe
it
weill
say
this
could
be
the
great
deal
of
all
time
although
he
d
be
kept
in
the
dark
about
the
meeting
with
reed
dimon
knew
what
his
bos
be
talk
about
the
mother
of
all
deal
he
ask
yeah
the
deal
to
beat
all
deal
sandy
reply
dimon
be
floor
this
be
the
dream
they
d
be
talk
about
for
the
well
part
of
a
decade
from
their
modest
beginning
in
baltimore
indeed
from
the
listless
day
in
the
seagram
building
in
they
have
somehow
manage
to
get
to
this
point
the
absolute
pinnacle
of
their
industry
the
mother
of
all
deal
be
no
longer
just
a
joke
to
be
bandy
about
during
bullshitting
session
upon
reflection
reed
found
the
idea
compelling
enough
to
suggest
that
weill
continue
discussion
with
citicorps
vice
chairman
paul
collins
and
a
second
meeting
be
schedule
for
march
by
this
time
weill
felt
it
important
enough
to
bring
both
dimon
and
the
head
of
corporate
planning
mike
carpenter
into
the
loop
and
the
two
men
join
collins
and
weill
on
march
at
weill
s
apartment
to
continue
figure
out
how
such
a
combination
might
work
over
the
next
few
day
dimon
himself
field
most
of
collins
s
financial
question
about
a
deal

the
two
company
team
agree
to
meet
in
armonk
on
march
and
once
reed
have
return
from
a
trip
overseas
in
advance
of
that
however
weill
invite
reed
to
a
private
meeting
on
the
even
of
the
nineteenth
and
it
be
over
dinner
that
he
secretly
drop
the
first
of
several
bomb
design
to
curtail
his
prot
g
s
ambition
have
notice
that
reed
have
take
a
like
to
dimon
weill
later
write
he
told
reed
not
to
view
dimon
as
the
eventual
ceo
of
the
combine
firm
don
t
do
this
deal
in
order
to
get
jamie
as
a
successor
weill
say
you
ll
have
to
see
for
yourself
but
there
be
issue
here
you
aren
t
aware
of
little
more
be
say
on
the
issue
but
an
inexorable
process
have
begin
james
robinson
have
dispatch
sandy
weill
in
part
by
co
opt
peter
cohen
weill
would
be
damn
if
that
be
go
to
happen
to
him
again
this
time
he
wasn
t
go
to
go
up
and
out
over
the
next
two
day
the
team
hash
out
much
of
the
conceptual
framework
for
a
merger
include
a
name
citigroup
and
a
plan
that
the
company
would
have
three
main
division
the
corporate
investment
bank
the
consumer
business
and
asset
management
dimon
quite
reasonably
assume
that
he
would
be
put
in
charge
of
run
the
corporate
investment
bank
the
same
job
he
have
share
with
maughan
at
salomon
smith
barney
what
he
do
not
consider
give
his
place
on
the
board
of
traveler
and
its
predecessor
company
for
several
year
be
the
possibility
that
he
would
not
be
on
citigroup
s
board
and
that
s
when
weill
lobbed
bomb
number
two
in
mid
march
while
the
two
men
go
over
detail
of
the
deal
at
weill
s
apartment
he
turn
to
his
longtime
lieutenant
and
say
jamie
you
re
not
go
to
be
on
the
new
board
this
statement
marked
the
final
and
irreconcilable
breach
in
a
relationship
that
have
once
be
closer
than
the
bond
between
most
father
and
son
even
if
the
two
men
chafed
at
such
a
notion
it
be
not
just
another
disagreement
weill
be
tell
dimon
that
he
be
never
go
to
become
ceo
of
citigroup
this
be
the
end
albeit
at
this
point
more
figuratively
than
literally
in
the
fairy
tale
version
of
dimon
s
career
he
succeed
his
mentor
and
lead
citigroup
to
great
glory
in
the
fairy
tale

not
on
the
verge
of
extinction
year
later
while
jamie
dimon
be
lead
one
of
its
only
healthy
competitor
the
future
of
american
banking
in
other
word
be
shape
by
this
very
moment
how
much
different
history
might
have
be
have
sandy
weill
do
what
dimon
fully
expect
him
to
assure
him
that
the
job
would
soon
be
his
but
weill
be
not
yet
ready
to
think
past
his
own
career
he
be
living
in
the
present
and
he
be
sick
to
death
of

his

what
most

much
discussion
about
his

out
that
in
the
event
he
do

only
president

major
public
company
not
on
its

in

they

the
untouchable
on
the

that
their

at

practically
guaranteed
that
they
would
be
give
the
most
senior
sub

role
in
the

and
at
first
that
s
what
it
seem
would
happen
reed
who
have
demonstrate
respect
for
dimon
s
intellect
and
drive
have
no
problem
elevate
dimon
above
other
citicorp
executive
in
the

company
i
ve
only
met
two
men
who
can
carry
a

balance
sheet
in
their
head
bill
campbell
later
observe
john
reed
and
jamie
dimon
dimon
also
felt
he
have
something
in
common
with
reed
he
could
be
a
cold
blood
analytic
and
so
could
i
he
recall
give
dimon
s
nearly
sterling
reputation
on
wall
street
no
one
on
the
citicorp
side
seem
to
find
the
prospect
unsettle
in
addition
to
whatever
operating
role
he
held
he
would
be
president
of
citigroup
right
underneath
the
co
ceo
and
the
first
pas
at
a
management
structure
reflect
just
that
the
men
also
agree
that
dimon
would
be
chief
executive
officer
of
citigroup
s
global
corporate
unit
which
would
include
both
salomon
smith
barney
and
the

corporate
banking
business
beneath
him
on
the
organizational
chart

victor

of

head
of

and
deryck

chief
of
salomon
smith
barney
satisfied
with
their
work
lipp
reed
collins
and
campbell
flew
back
to
new
york
while
weill
and
dimon
stayed
behind
for
a
meeting
with
a
contingent
of
broker
a
draft
announcement
have
even
be
write
up
ready
to
be
put
through
the
company
s
legal
and
public
relation
process
there
be
two
compete
account
of
what
happen
next
weill
say
that
maughan
flatly
refuse
to
report
to
dimon
and
demand
a
different
arrangement
langley
say
the
opposite
that
maughan
voiced
no
objection
whatsoever
weill
s
version
be
probably
the
truth
as
it
seem
unlikely
that
the
proud
englishman
would
cede
authority
to
dimon
without
at
least
token
opposition
still
in
thrall
to
maughan
weill
more
likely
than
not
agree
to
a
new
arrangement
without
put
up
much
of
a
fight
on
tuesday
of
the
week
follow
the
retreat
in
bermuda
he
told
the
reassemble
group
that
he
have
rethought
his
original
position
and
that
instead
of
have
maughan
report
to
dimon
the
two
men
should
be
co
ceo
of
the
global
corporate
unit
to
this
day
weill
will
argue
that
he
brought
deryck
maughan
over
to
traveler
in
the
salomon
deal
in
case
something
ever
happen
between
him
and
dimon
that
result
in
dimon
s
leave
the
company
i
do
it
in
case
of
a
blowup
with
jamie
he
say
in
an
interview
in
his
office
in
december
so
there
would
be
someone
else
who
knew
how
to
run
that
business
but
there
be
weill
propose
a
management
structure
that
be
itself
very
likely
to
precipitate
the
blowup
dimon
s
supporter
call
the
explanation
revisionist
think
deryck
s
a
nice
guy
say
one
but
deryck
be
not
capable
of
run
the
company
and
sandy
knew
that
so
he
s
full
of
shit
when
he
say
that
it
wasn
t
just
dimon
who
be
baffle
by
the
about
face
reed
too
be
curious
as
to
why
a
co
ceo
structure
be
necessary
weill
insist
that
maughan
would
quit
reed
reportedly
reply
who
give
a
shit
let
him
leave
but
weill
wouldn
t
budge
and
offer
a
mealymouthed
litany
of
reason
why
his
hand
be
tie
you
guy
be
crazy
dimon
say
in
a
meeting
with
weill
and
reed
it
s
an
outrage
it
will
destroy
the
company
i
m
shock
you
would
even
think
about
something
like
this
the
day
you
announce
it
the
troop
will
be
line
up
ready
to
go
to
war
this
will
be
trench
warfare
and
by
the
time
you
two
figure
it
out
everybody
will
be
so
discredit
people
won
t
know
what
to
do
about
it
sandy

that
he
and

to
be

to
which
dimon
respond

former
traveler
executive
dimon

maughan
be
put
in
charge
of
the

there
would

among

i

i
don

have
the

i
m
not

but
you
re
go
to
give
me
a
title
i
should
have
realize
it
when
he
told
me
about
the

i
should
have
left
the
company
at
that
point
you
d
think
by
then
i
might
have
figure
it
out

i
didn

i
accepted
that
too
didn

i
sandy
know
exactly
how
far
he
can
go
i
love
the
company
it
be
my
family
i
couldn
t
leave
them
but
sandy
doesn
t
always
think
about
just
right

wrong
he
think
about
his
option
down
the
road
the
board
decision
be
the
sign
and
i
should
have
know
well
but
look
you
live
and
learn
thing
then
proceed
accord

begin
to
sense
that
maybe
the
jig
be
up
with
a
number
of

from

a
surprisingly
poor
job
of
ingratiate
themselves

richard

a

on
the
thirty
ninth
floor
of

it
upon

and
threw
his
on
the

with
a
dismissive
shrug
but
weill
ignore
the
request
and
walk
out
of
the

the
salomon
swashbuckler
weren
t

maughan
anymore
they
be

with
sandy
weill

jamie
dimon
their
new

weren
t
sure
they
even
trust
the
group
at
the
turn
of
the
year
for
example
both
weill
and
dimon
be
get
nervous
about
russia
its
lawlessness
its
nuclear
threat
and
the
prospect
that
it
might
default
on
its
debt
but
their
exhortation
to
draw
down
salomon
s
russian
exposure
never
seem
to
be
put
into
action
in
a
meeting
with
the
arbitrageur
in
june
recall
bookstaber
dimon
be
more
forthright
hold
his
hand
up
thumb
and
forefinger
nearly
touch
he
bark
by
our
next
meeting
i
want
our
russia
exposure
down
to
this
his
instruction
be
follow
and
it
prove
a
prescient
decision
in
july
russia
nearly
default
save
only
by
a
billion
bailout
organize
by
secretary
of
the

bob
rubin
and
on
august
russia
actually
default
on
its
domestic
ruble
debt
the
last
straw
come
soon
thereafter
when
the
fact
emerge
during
a
risk
management
meeting
that
the
unit
have
somehow
found
itself
with
an
outright
bet
on
the
direction
of
the
yen
worth
billion
dimon
have
previously
told
the
group
it
be
forbidden
to
make
outright
bet
and
be
to
restrict
itself
to
relative
value
trade
buying
one
security
while
sell
short
a
similar
one
simultaneously
and
he
be
understandably
furious
at
this
point
the
group
s
fate
be
seal
the
group
member
be
completely
ignore
their
bos
s
order
or
they
be
incompetent
either
way
they
have
lose
the
faith
of
traveler
top
management
on
the
monday
of
the
july
fourth
weekend
dimon
summon
the
arbitrage
group
and
inform
its
member
that
it
be
be
disband
accord
to
bookstaber
dimon
be
succinct
the
follow
will
be
release
to
the
press
in
five
minute
he
say
before
reading
a
press
release
announce
the
group
s
dissolution
member
of
the
unit
have
one
month
to
decide
if
they
want
to
stay
on
at
the
company
or
take
a
severance
package
and
then
he
left
the
headline
of
a
column
by
floyd
norris
of
the
new
york
time
put
it
simply
they
bought
salomon
then
they
kill
it
dimon
offer
a
nuanced
explanation
of
the
decision
to
close
the
unit
down
he
and
others
realize
he
say
that
the
firm
be
duplicate
trade
in
different
business
unit
one
trade
on
the
government
bond
desk
so
call
on
the
run
versus
off
the
run
treasury
be
replicate
by
the
proprietary
trader
likewise
in
mortgage
likewise
in
municipal
bond
arbitrage
and
the
proprietary
desk
be
take
far
large
gamble
with
the
duplicate
trade
you
get
the
guy
in
the
other
business
that
be
work
hour
week
and
the
guy
on
the
prop
desk
work
hour
week
he
recall
but
who
get
preferential
access
to
our
balance
sheet
the
guy
in
arbitrage
who
get
to
use
the
short
who
get
to
use
the
hard
to
borrows
who
get
the
cheap
financing
but
it
be
the
same
trade
over
here
the
other
flaw
be
that
the
prop
desk
be
motivate
by
the
structure
of
their
compensation
deal
to
maximize
their
bet
thank
god
we
close
it
we
lose
more
than
million
but
it
could
have
be
multiple
of
that
contrary
to
the
image
of

as
a
perpetual

at

want
to
reduce
the

you
to
weill

lead
the

through
a

of

when
he
decline
to
address
the
specific
ltcm
exposure
probably
at
dimon
s
behest
weill
go
ballistic
and
appropriately
so
with
much
of
wall
street
expose
to

the

failure
could
prove
catastrophic

up
in
the
idea
that

in
his

he
couldn

have
make
a
sensible
judgment
remembers
the

say
that
this
wasn

the
case
that
weill
didn
t
even
understand
the
detail
and
be
just
be
difficult
it

then
clear
to

would
make
an
effort
to
dial
back
his
behavior

through
this
predicament

in

word
they
be
refuse

their
boss
bidding
dimon
have
a
number
of
fundamental
problem
he
have
somehow
fail
to
recognize
he

weill

always
prove
capable
of

their
way
to
conclusion
that
work
to
the
advantage
of

in

acquire
the

which
make
him
unable
to
hear
anything

what
he
want
to

maughan
easily
grasped
that

then
it
hit
him
because

for
behaving
like
a
petulant
teenager
not
that
it

entirely
his
fault
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
the

of

openly
test
his
prot

as
if
all
their

of
work
closely

have
meant
nothing
perhaps
if

have
be
able
to
consider
this
a
momentary
phase
in
their
relationship
as
perhaps
it
be
he
might
have

to
restrain
his
bad
instinct

that
s
not
what

shortly
after
the

close
sandy
weill

john

convene
a
management
meeting
in

new

the
topic
be
suppose
to
be
about
integrate
the
two
company
but
the
subject
that
dominate
the
proceeding
be
the
same
one
they
have
be
hung
up
on
for
month
how
to
split
one
job
the
head

among
three
men
jamie
dimon
deryck
maughan
and
victor

weill
handle
it
poorly
like
a
scold
parent
he
order
the
three
men
into
a
conference
room
and
told
them
not
to
emerge
until
they
have
a
solution
this
work
out
about
as
well
as
can
be
imagine
the
only
thing
they
manage
to
agree
on
be
that
a
tri
head
structure
simply
could
not
work
on
the
weekend
of
october
the
combine
company
held
a
five
day
retreat
for
top
executive
and
their

at
greenbrier
the
luxury
resort
in

there
be
serious
business

conduct
they
be
attempt
the
large
corporate
integration
in
the
history
of

but
it
be
also
intend
to
be
a
festive
occasion
a
celebration
of
the
record
break
deal
however
there
be
almost
no
good
cheer
among
the
salomon
smith
barney
crowd
and
much
of
the
event
be
marked
by
quarrel
at
one
meeting
smith
barney
s
capital
market
chief
steve
black
openly
quarrel
with
maughan
about
how
best
to
manage
the
company
s
corporate
and
investment
bank
unit
at
this
point
dimon
played
the
peacemaker
step
in
to
quell
heat
emotion
during
presentation
by
various
business
head
weill
recall
be
struck
by
the
difference
between
a
polished
presentation
by
maughan
and
an
incoherent
one
by
dimon
include
a
strange
analogy
with
the
peloponnesian
war
weill
felt
that
dimon
s
apparent
lack
of
preparation
be
insult
and
that
as
a
result
dimon
seem
anything
but
presidential
dimon
s
memory
about
the
quality
of
his
presentation
be
hazy
but
the
suggestion
that
his
career
could
be
judged
on
one
presentation
at
an
executive
retreat
rankles
maybe
i
didn
t
give
a
good
presentation
he
say
but
do
you
think
it
s
acceptable
to
judge
a
year
career
on
one
presentation
rather
than
take
command
of
the
deteriorate
situation
and
pull
everyone
together
weill
seem
to
purposefully
dial
up
the
tension
at
a
group
dinner
he
ask
those
attend
to
name
the
person
who
would
succeed
them
in
their
role
at
citigroup
neither
dimon
nor
maughan
mention
the
other
and
even
more
pointedly
weill
himself
didn
t
offer
an
answer
steve
black
show
the
most
visible
sign
of
the
grow
unease
dimon
have
long
ago
told
black
that
he
plan
to
embrace
the
salomon
people
come
hell
or
high
water
because
he
want
to
make
the
merger
work
in
turn
dimon
have
ask
maughan
to
put
his
arm
around
steve
and
make
him
comfortable
instead
of
do
that
maughan
do
the
opposite
once
invite
black
out
for
dinner
only
to
tell
him
that
he
didn
t
give
a
damn
about
black
s
future
that
the
only
people
who
matter
be
dimon
and
maughan
black
maughan
make
clear
be
a
fool
for
hang
around
then
during
a
black
tie
ball
on
saturday
october
dimon
and
his
wife
judy
sat
with
steve
black
and
his
wife
debbie
in
a
gesture
that
could
have
move
thing
in
another
direction
entirely

on
the
entire
weekend
as
something
of
an
out

one
nobody
have

be
it
time
for
dimon

work
with

long
try

no

he
be
outnumber
weill

sick
of

a
dimon
acolyte

never
forgiven
him
for
make

though
no
enemy
of

have
only
recently
join
the
company
weill
write
in
the
real
deal
that
only
at
three
o
clock
that
morning
when
he
be
alone
with
joan
do
it
finally
dawn
on
him
that
dimon
must
leave
but
his
retell
lack
credibility
weill
have
played
a
machiavellian
game
with
dimon
for
several
year
the
appointment
of
maughan
as
co
ceo
be
merely
the
last
in
a
series
of
move
that
if
not
explicitly
design
to
frustrate
dimon
have
the
effect
of
fray
their
relationship
weill
simply
refuse
to
acknowledge
how
his
own
behavior
have
provoke
dimon
the
next
morning
most
citigroup
executive
still
do
not
know
what
have
happen
when
charlie
scharf
and
his
wife
show
up
in
the
lobby
happy
and
chipper
he
couldn
t
get
a
read
on
the
mood
it
s
like
a
morgue
in
here
he
told
his
wife
once
the
two
be
in
a
car
on
the
way
to
the
airport
he
be
told
about
the
near
brawl

once
he
have
decide
on
a
course
of
action
weill
move
expeditiously
he
call
reed
who
be
flabbergast
at
hearing
of
dimon
s
behavior
the
two
men
finally
accepted
what
their
tri
ceo
have
be
try
to
tell
them
for
month
that
something
have
to
give
on
monday
october
weill
and
reed
ask
citigroup
s
general
counsel
chuck
prince
to
conduct
an
investigation
into
the
incident
and
to
report
back
by
the
end
of
the
week
on
monday
and
tuesday
dimon
remain
in
his
downtown
office
at
salomon
smith
barney
he
and
weill
have
a
single
brief
phone
conversation
during
which
weill
determine
that
dimon
have
no
plan
to
apologize
for
his
action
but
the
point
be
academic
prince
ever
the
yes
man
give
his
new
bos
exactly
what
weill
have
want
conclude
that
dimon
have
be
in
the
wrong
equally
important
the
spectacle
of
his
executive
fight
like
schoolchildren
be
all
a
man
like
john
reed
need
to
entirely
change
his
opinion
of
someone
reed
be
a
man
for
whom
cordiality
no
matter
how
phony
must
be
maintain
at
all
cost
any
misgiving
he
have
about
the
merger
with
traveler
be
precisely
about
the
possible
coarsen
of
the
citicorp
culture
the
last
thing
he
want
to
do
be
turn
over
the
institution
he
have
nurture
to
a
bunch
of
hooligan
jamie
have
become
an
impediment
to
make
this
merger
work
weill
say
to
reed
we
ve
get
to
ask
him
to
leave
reed
never
know
for
his
warmth
deliver
a
stone
cold
response
you
re
absolutely
right
jamie
s
get
to
go
weill
have
the
backing
he
need
lipp
told
weill
that
he
be
act
rashly
and
that
he
should
give
the
situation
six
more
month
but
weill
overrule
him
weill
later
write
that
his
relationship
with
reed
reach
its
zenith
at
this
moment
reed
after
all
have
give
him
the
support
he
need
to
make
one
of
the
big
decision
of
his
life
a
less
charitable
interpretation
be
that
weill
the
master
manipulator
have
use
reed
as
a
pawn
in
his
endgame
with
jamie
dimon
for
all
his
intelligence
and
drive
dimon
be
also
predictable
push
the
right
button
such
as
give
him
yet
another
co
this
or
co
that
and
he
would
get
angry
for
dimon
the
co
ceo
position
be
an
annoyance
not
just
because
he
have
to
share
power
but
also
because
he
believe
them
to
be
an
inefficient
way
to
manage
push
another
button
like
weill
s
ask
his
executive
to
name
their
successor
and
you
have
a
man
ready
to
crack
and
crack
he
do
remarkably
dimon
fail
to
see
it
come
he
do
not
grasp
that
his
time
at
citigroup
be
come
to
a
close
on
friday
even
october
he
sat
in
his
office
with
his
assistant
theresa
sweeney
and
ask
her
what
change
she
thought
would
come
out
of
a
management
meeting
in
armonk
on
sunday
it
be
his
belief
that
at
the
meeting
the
management
structure
would
finally
be
adjust
to
his
advantage
still
while
a
part
of
him
assume
that
thing
would
work
out
as
they
always
have
with
dimon
get
his
way
and
another
incompetent
partner
remove
from
his
orbit
another
part
of
him
be
concerned
the
previous
week
have
be
a
conspicuously
quiet
one
sweeney
told
him
she
hop
weill
would
make
him
sole
ceo
of
the
corporate
investment
bank
so
that
he
could
get
on
with
the
work
that
need
to
be
do
dimon
seem
to
hope
the
same
unaware
that
his
own
ouster
be
in
the
work
dimon
invite
salomon
smith
barney

to
his
park

apartment
on
sunday
for

on
his
expansive
terrace

sat
around
in
a
smith

tracksuit
then
weill
call
ask
him
to
come
up
to
armonk
early
dimon
reply
that
because
of
the
brunch
he
couldn
t
leave
at
the
very
moment
but
that
he
would
be
there
as
soon
as
he
could
dimon
eventually
drove
up
to
armonk
and
walk
unwittingly
into
his
own
execution
weill
and
reed
sat
him
down
in
a
small
conference
room
we
ve
do
a
lot
of
think
about
the
organization

one
threw
dimon
for
a
loop
as

be
his
job
but
weill
wasn
t
quite

and
we
want

his
shock

and
sat
down
in
a
large
conference
room
with

to
finalize
the
press

curiously
stayed

afternoon
dimon

inform

that
unless
he
get
on
board
with
the
decision
he
might
as
well
start
pack
his
bag
as
well
but
weill
have
a
much
subtler
message
for
the
year
veteran
unless
black
be
prepared
to
tell
colleague
that
he
agree
with
the
decision
he
be
no
longer
a
welcome
member
of
the
team
i
m
not
go
to
be

black
told
weill
but
if
you
re
tell
me
that
in
order
to
stay
here
i
have
to
stand
up
in
front
of
a
large
group
of
people
and
lie
i
m
not
go
to
do
it
so
maybe
it
s
time
for
me
to
go
as
well
realize
that
black
be
serious
carpenter
backtrack
and
spent
the
next
several
day
try

convince
weill
that
even
though
he
have
the
knife
out
he
didn
t
have
to
get
more
blood
on
it
maybe
it
be
best
to
keep
black
around
but
weill
be
adamant
a
notorious
worrier
he
call
black
late
in
the
afternoon
on
friday
november
clearly
hop
to
settle
the
matter
so
that
it
wouldn
t
ruin
the
weekend
twenty
five
year
be
a
long
time
but
if
you
can
t
get
fully
behind
everything
we
re
do
i
think
its
time
for
you
to
go
he
told
black
black
reply
that
he
thought
weill
have
fire
dimon
for
all
the
wrong
reason
and
that
he
couldn
t
possibly
stand
in
front
of
his
colleague
and
condone
the
move
weill
didn
t
budge
then
it
s
time
for
you
to
go
fine
i
m
out
i
m
do

sweeney

to
leave
the

along
with

dimon
felt
horrible
that
black
be
in
some
sense
collateral
damage
of
his
own
battle
with
weill
i
respect
steve

loyalty
but
i
told
him
to
do
what
be
right
for
himself
he
recall
i
felt
terrible
for
him
i
didn

want
him
to
lose
his

about

what
exactly
have
lead
weill

such
a
monumental
choice
one
that
have
over
the
year
come
to
seem
ever
more
rash
and
ill
conceive
weill
ultimately
come
to
view
the
conflict
in
very
simple
term
dimon
be
ready
to
be
ceo
and
weill
wasn
t
ready
to
retire
weill
s
wife
joan
say
much
the
same
thing
in
weill
s
autobiography
the
problem
be
that
sandy
be
too
young
to
step
aside
so
the
mentoree
couldn
t
get
past
the
mentor
she
told
weill
s
collaborator
judah
kraushaar
unable
to
resist
another
twist
of
the
knife
she
go
on
to
say
there
s
a
reason
that
people
like
frank
zarb
and
bob
greenhill
left
the
company
they
all
complain
about
jamie
be
headstrong
ask
whether
that
be
a
fair
assessment
zarb
responds
not
true
at
all
dimon
also
saw
the
conflict
between
him
and
weill
in
uncomplicated
term
i
stuck
my
finger
in
sandy
s
eye
he
told
the
new
york
time
magazine
in
more
than
a
few
colleague
see
the
situation
as
result
from
an
escalation
of
a
certain
pattern
jamie
do
the
work
zarb
get
the
glory
jamie
do
the
work
greenhill
get
the
glory
then
along
come
deryck
maughan
and
dimon
be
ask
to
share
once
again
not
only
with
maughan
but
also
victor
menezes
of
citicorp
i
don
t
know
how
many
time
you
can
go
to
that
well
before
the
well
rebel
say
one
executive
in
his
autobiography
weill
try
to
argue
that
jamie
dimon
be
never
his
heir
apparent
most
knowledgeable
source
consider
that
revisionist
history
he
should
have
be
a
soviet
one
say
after
reading
the
passage
you
sit
there
and
go
what
be
you
kid
but
sandy
say
some
thing
enough
time
that
he
actually
start
to
believe
them
weill
steadfastly
maintain
that
the
fallout
over
his
daughter
s
departure
have
nothing
to
do
with
dimon
s
fire
but
he
also
suggest
that
dimon
have
lose
joan
s
backing
as
a
result
of
the
way
jessica
have
be
treat
in
the
end
though
weill
maintains
that
he
simply
could
no
longer
put
up
with
dimon
s
flagrant
display
of
disrespect
jamie
have
annoyed
me
to
no
end
over
the
last
three
year
and
our
relationship
have
gotten
so
dysfunctional
that
it
plainly
be
hurt
others
in
our
company
he
write
in
the
real
deal
still
i
felt
sick
give
all
that
we
have
accomplish
together
jamie
have
want
me
to
treat
him
as
an
equal
partner
a
desire
for
recognition
that
i
understood
but
be
unwilling
to
satisfy
i
be
nearly
twenty
five
year
his
senior
and
his
demand
for
equal
treatment
be
disproportionate
with
what
he
deserve
weill
go
on
to
chide
himself
for
nothing
more
than
a
failure
to
teach
i
brought
jamie
along
quickly
and
in
do
so
probably
give
him
a
sense
of
entitlement
which
discourage
him
from
building
a
consensual
management
style
he
write
my
real
mistake
though
be
that
i
repeatedly
miss
the
chance
in
our
early
year
together
to
curtail
his
aggressive
behavior
and
mentor
him
into
become
a
team
player
weill
be
not
alone
in
that
sentiment
there
be
many
who
thought
that
dimon
might
not
have
what
it
take
to
be
a
true
leader
in
large
part
because
of
his
temper
dimon
would
suggest
that
his
problem
be
not
that
he
be
not
a
team
player
he
work
extremely
well
with
the
like
of
bob
lipp
bob
willumstad
marge
magner
and
even
chuck
prince
but
that
the
relationship
between
him
and
weill
be
the
issue
eight
year
later
in
late
weill
have
begin
to
voice
regret
i
have
no
doubt
what
jamie
could
achieve
he
say
i
love
work
with
him
i
love
the
relationship
we
have
and
i
feel
terrible
that
it
s
not
what
it
could
ve
be
i
be
very
proud
of
what
he
s
do
mary
mcdermott
citi
s
communication
chief
be
on
vacation
in

when
she
heard
of
the
fire
sit
in
the
grand
hotel
in
florence
she
found
herself
cry
her
eye
out
weill
later
ask
her
to
call
fortune
magazine
s
influential
columnist
carol
loomis
to
say
that
it
be
the
hardest
thing
he
d
ever
do
in
his
life
loomis
s
blunt
reply
but
he
do
it
didn
t
he
both
men
should
have
face
up
to
their
issue
earlier
weill
might
have
stood
up
to
dimon
more
forcefully
earlier
than
he
do
have
be
unclear
about
succession
he
must
have
know
the
frustration
he
be
cause
his
prot
g
it
be
entirely
reasonable
that
some
loyalist
fed
dimon
s
ego
in
hope
of
plum
role
when
the
succession
actually
come
to
pas
dimon
might
also
have
come
to
term
with
weill
s
inability
to
let
go
and
perhaps
left
the
firm
to
strike
out
on
his
own
before
he
be
force
out
to
some
colleague
it
seem
as
if
to
dimon
it
be
all
about
dimon
and
nothing
more
when
we
get
to
the
point
of
how
citigroup
be
go
to
be
organize
the
whole
process
be
put
on
hold
for
three
week
because
of
jamie
say
one
traveler
executive
he
want
to
be
president
he
want
to
run
the
corporate
investment
bank
he
could
be
one
or
the
other
but
not
both
and
he
held
out
for
both
it
have
a
lot
to
do
with
his
ego
and
his
relationship
with
deryck
i
want
this
job
i
want
that
job
everybody
be
think
jesus
christ
man
we
have
just
do
this
huge
merger
and
all
you
be
focus
on
be
you
it
ground
on
him
so
much
because
he
thought
he
d
make
sandy
so
he
didn
t
understand
how
this
be
happen
to
him
dimon
categorically
denies
this
account
and
insists
that
he
didn
t
even
want
the
title
of
president
of
the
parent
he
thought
it
a
dumb
title
especially
when
he
have
a
real
one
run
salomon
smith
barney
in
retrospect
what
happen
be
simple
enough
dimon
be
endanger
weill
s
ability
to
successfully
integrate
the
two
company
and
to
add
to
his
ever
grow
reputation
and
when
it
come
to
the
short
stroke
sandy
weill
be
always
about
himself
all
the
way
back
to
cogan
berlind
weill
levitt
and
no
one
not
even
jamie
dimon
be
go
to
stand
in
his
way
dimon
be
only
the
late
and
most
prominent
in
a
long
line
of
sandy
weill
casualty
the
only
difference
be
that
dimon
have
more
talent
and
capability
than
anyone
sandy
have
ever
rough
up
before
and
that
they
have
share
the
long
and
deepest
relationship
in
the
process
weill
lose
the
last
person
who
work
for
him
who
stood
up
to
him
cost
be
damn
i
always
think
of
jamie
at
citigroup
recall
bob
willumstad
as
be
the
guy
who
would
say
what
everyone
else
be
think
from
dimon
s
perspective
it
s
important
to
understand
that
his
confidence
in
his
own
instinct
make
it
nearly
a
give
that
he
wasn
t
go
to
be
satisfied
with
be
a
great
assistant
coach
yes
sandy
weill
do
have
the
vision
and
yes
jamie
dimon
be
the
operation
guy
after
the
citicorp
merger
though
there
be
nothing
left
to
do
but
integrate
the
two
company
dimon
could
be
forgiven
for
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
company
be
no
longer
in
need
of
weill
s
particular
skill
but
desperately
in
need
of
his
own
and
if
that
have
be
the
case
why
shouldn
t
the
title
have
come
along
with
the

it

now
if

it
s
pretty
amaze

what
lesson
jamie
dimon
take
from
sandy
weill
be
a
question
that
have
preoccupy
a
lot
of
market
commentator
since
dimon
s
exit
from
citigroup
even
though
more
than
a
decade
have
pass
since
they
work
together
the
business
press
never
tire
of
rehash
the
issue
it
s
an
obsession
best
characterize
by
a
post
on
the
website
marketwatch
com
in
before
brad
and
jen
there
be
sandy
and
jamie
there
have
never
be
much
debate
as
to
whether
weill
or
dimon
posse
more
raw
intellectual
firepower
it
be
dimon
no
question
sandy
weill
on
the
other
hand
be
proof
that
you
should
never
underestimate
the
man
who
overestimate
himself
at
least
not
when
all
the
star
be
align
in
his
favor
cheap
financing
a
rise
market
and
a
fawn
business
press
that
say
weill
surely
pass
on
a
number
of
crucial
rule
of
run
a
business
the
first
when
you
re
do
m
a
do
it
quickly
and
efficiently
with
no
uncertainty
weill
could
be
ruthless
in
start
to
clean
house
virtually
the
instant
a
deal
be
do
but
it
be
an
effective
way
to
get
everyone
move
forward
at
once
that
s
sandy
s
drill
say
marge
magner
who
stayed
on
at
citigroup
until
it
come
out
almost
automatically
weill
also
show
dimon
the
benefit
of
take
the
long
view
as
weill
show
in
both
phase
of
his
career
when
you
work
with
him
it
be
almost
impossible
to
view
something
as
a
stop
point
he
be
always
think
about
what
thing
could
be
sandy
give
him
that
whole
concept
of
look
out
and
be
opportunistic
and
know
where
you
re
go
recall
joe
wright
dimon
too
remains
in
awe
of
weill
s
audacity
to
do
the
deal
that
we
do
he
recall
i
look
back
at
those
and
think
god
sandy
you
have
gut
weill
also
impressed
upon
dimon
the
importance
of
get
your
entire
house
in
order
not
just
the
shopwindow
that
customer
see
when
you
re
in
a
commodity
business
the
only
way
to
thrive
be
to
be
a
low
cost
producer
and
when
you
re
sell
money
you
re
in
a
commodity
business
another
long
held
weill
principle
know
when
to
be
capital
rich
both
the
economy
and
wall
street
have
cycle
and
he
who
be
capital
rich
when
the
competition
stumble
will
see
opportunity
abound
weill
use
this
strategy
to
great
effect
in
both
stage
of
his
career
and
it
allow
him
to
take
over
much
large
company
with
his
small
but
more
financially
secure
organization
too
many
discussion
of
both
weill
and
dimon
paint
the
two
as
risk
averse
neither
be
anything
of
the
sort
rather
they
have
eschew
financial
risk
so
that
they
might
embrace
strategic
one
it
s
reductive
but
the
secret
to
sandy
weill
s
success
be
no
secret
as
dick
bove
at
that
time
an
analyst
with
the
security
firm
laden
burg
thalmann
put
it
buy
business
with
significant
cash
flow
preferably
at
a
discount
prune
their
expense
without
sacrifice
revenue
and
then
use
that
additional
cash
flow
from
those
cut
to
buy
more
company
until
you
end
up
own
citigroup
dimon
later
say
that
he
learn
a
lot
from
sandy
weill
include
what
not
to
do
among
the
thing
not
to
do
hog
the
spotlight
so
much
that
your
senior
team
feel
underappreciated
heidi
miller
told
business
week
in
the
sandy
mythology
be
so
large
that
it
often
obscures
the
contribution
that
other
people
make
sandy
wasn
t
a
mentor
in
the
traditional
sense
dimon
recall
in
the
sense
of
people
give
you
advice
and
sit
you
down
that
s
what
most
people
mean
i
get
none
of
that
sandy
be
much
more
sink
or
swim
and
he
just
shed
people
left
and
right
who
didn
t
meet
his
standard
but
it
wasn
t
really
a
mentor
thing
he
have
a
tremendous
work
ethic
and
he
be
always
think
about
how
the
world
be
go
to
change
he
be
brave
and
bold
i
learn
a
tremendous
amount
from
him
jamie
be
the
smartest
man
i
ever
work
with
recall
dimon
s
former
colleague
mary
mcdermott
but
sandy
have
the
best
instinct
i
guess
that
s
why
they
work
so
well
together
brian
posner
echoed
that
sentiment
jamie
be
really
about
precision
and
know
everything
about
everything
he
say
sandy
be
much
more
conceptual
about
the
big
picture
even
if
your
business
be
your
life
it
s
important
to
keep
some
distance
between
your
work
life
and
your
home
life
for
sandy
weill
there
be
no
distinction
and
that
lack
of
clarity
cloud
important
issue
in
the
office
particularly
when
it
come
to
his
child
although
dimon
be
both
friend
and
friendly
with
his
subordinate
he
do
maintain
more
distance
than
weill
ever
do
and
therein
lie
a
profound
difference
between
the
two
men
sandy
weill
need
to
be
like
jamie
dimon
doesn
t
really
care
if
you
like
him
or
not
dimon
will
ask
one
or
two
employee
to
join
him
for
drink
weill
asks
people
to
his
farm
to
pick
apple
throughout
his
career
sandy
could
engage
people
in
a
way
that
be
unique
and
make
them
feel
good
about
themselves
and
what
they
be
do
recall
jay
mandelbaum
but
jamie
have
a
different
leadership
approach
which
be
base
more
on
his
ability
fairness
and
directness
sandy
s
a
smart
guy
but
his
success
be
often
base
more
on
how
he
related
to
people
weill
be
and
remains
a
bit
of
a
goofball
at
a
birthday
party
plan
for
him
at
the
four
season
the
crowd
listen
to
i
heard
it
through
the
grapevine
sung
by
a
bunch
of
people
dress
as
grape
that
be
not
dimon
s
style
ask
in
late
what
other
rule
of
thumb
he
practice
in
his
career
weill
respond
succinctly
don
t
fuck
up
but
that
s
precisely
what
he
do
in
the
fall
of

dimon
wasn
t
exactly
force
into
penury
when
he
be
fire
he
eventually
reach
a
million
severance
agreement
which
include
a
three
year
three
phase
noncompete
that
go
far
above
and
beyond
the
norm
black
receive
million
dimon
be
rich
enough
never
to
work
another
day
in
his
life
but
at
he
be
certainly
not
contemplate
retirement
this
be
a
man
who
over
the
course
of
his
year
follow
business
school
have
spent
about
hour
a
week
at
work
he
be
however
completely
demoralize
by
the
turn
of
event
the
weekend
after
his
fire
dimon
and
judy
attend
a

in
darien
connecticut
he
be
devastate
recall
laurie
maglathlin
and
totally
blindside
i
really
do
believe
that
when
he
walk
into
that
office
he
have
no
idea
he
be
go
to
walk
out
without
a
job
and
it
wasn
t
about
be
humiliate
even
though
he
have
be
it
be
more
about
him
be
hurt
and
betrayed

tear
his

away
and
you
have

more

a
bizarre
move
his
former

to
give
dimon
temporary

the

be
yet
to
come
a
tough
man
with
a
lot
of

shortly
thereafter
he
and
weill
found
themselves
in
the
four

at
the

do
not

sober
dimon
take
him
off
the
frenetic
overachiever
s
treadmill
he
d
be
on
since
college
it
be
a
position
very
similar
to
weill
s
after
his
own
ouster
it
be
a
strange
time
for
him
dimon
have
told
jon
friedman
of
business
week
in
regard
weill
s
time

he
have
be
run
nonstop
his
whole
work
life
dimon
might
have
be
speak
of
himself
in
the
break
give
dimon
more
time
to
spend
with
his
child
as
well
as
time
to
talk
with
judy
about
his
fire
if
dimon
be
hurt
at
be
cast
aside
judy
be
furious
even
though
jamie
be
at
peace
with
himself
i
be
a
rag
maniac
because
of
the
way
he
d
be
treat
she
recall
dimon
constantly
remind
his
wife
that
it
be
his
net
worth
not
his
self
worth
that
have
be
tie
to
the

the
latter
he
say
be
something
sandy
weill
could
never
take
from
him
nor
for
that
matter
could
weill
take
his
net
worth
which
by
that
point
be
quite
substantial
dimon
lean
on
judy
during
his
time
off
and
by
all
account
she
be
the

herself
she
willingly
take

the
man
who
fire
him
a
man
it
should
be
point
out
who
could
not
bring
himself
to
express
an
apology
in
return
still
at
the
start
of
it
wasn
t
clear
yet
that
dimon
would
find
that
next
job
he
sought
in
financial
service
in
january
he
be
among
a

extremely
lucrative
move
he
briefly
consider
spending
his
time
merely
invest
his
own
substantial
fortune
but
his
heart
wasn
t
in
it
dimon
need
action
the
ebb
and
flow
of
a
real
company
do
real
business
in
the
meantime
though
he
be
hang
around
the
seagram

write
and
erase
plan
for
the
next
great
financial

then
one
day

i
think
i
m
go
to
take
a
job
campbell
laugh
jamie

apologize
he
say
you
re
a
young
guy
operating
company
be
totally
different
than
do
deal
and
you
want
to
operate
a
company
it
s
a
completely
different
undertaking
and
you
get
a
completely
different
payback
the
outsider
during
his
hiatus
jamie
dimon
have
be
court
by
some
of
the
most
respect
company
in
the
country
but
when
it
finally
come
time
to
commit
he
go
for
a
familiar
type
another
boring
bank
in
another
financial
service
backwater
as
he
have
do
with
sandy
weill
year
before
dimon
have
sniffed
out
a
financial
institution
in
distress
that
could
be
the
platform
on
which
to
build
an
empire
jamie
dimon
have
found
his
own
commercial
credit
it
be
call
bank
one
and
it
be
in
chicago
though
it
have
austere
root
go
back
to
banc
one
have
evolve
into
a
rather
unsightly
beast
a
decentralize
collection
of
regional
bank
built
through
a
decade
long
string
of
deal
the
last
significant
one
be
the
billion
combination
of
banc
one
of
columbus
ohio
and
first
chicago
nbd
of
illinois
that
deal
have
be
complete
in
when
the
traveler
citicorp
union
set
off
a
wave
of
consolidation
in
the
industry
but
neither
institution
have
want
to
entirely
cede
its
identity
so
a
compromise
have
be
reach
the
headquarters
would
be
in
chicago
and
the
partner
from
ohio
would
provide
the
name
albeit
with
a
k
instead
of
a
c
before
dimon
arrive
the
merger
have
largely
fail
to
take
though
the
institution
ranked
as
the
fourth
large
bank
in
the
country
the
combine
operation
be
beset
with
problem
from
the
start
the
ohio
side
have
be
a
hodgepodge
run
by
john
mccoy
whose
family
have
take
over
city
national
bank
in
ohio
in
and
have
proceed
to
make
acquisition
in
year
it
have
be
built
by
mean
of
a
strategy
that
be
as
laissez
faire
as
any
banc
one
s
modus
operandi
have
be
the
uncommon
partnership
competitor

bought
up
with
the
promise
that
they
d
be
allow
to
just
keep
on
do
what
they
be
do
so
long
as
they
sign
on
the
dot
line
it
be
an
attractive
proposition
to
seller
but
the
unfortunate
result
be
that
the
company
fail
to
take
advantage
of
synergy
or
scale
it
be
the
antithesis
of
the
weill

acquisition
model

to
complete
a

leg
up
in
the

its

a
merger
with

as
a

to
that

position
dimon
s
name
be
on
the
short
list
from
the
very
start
the
only
question
for
the

be
it
prudent
to
hire
a
man
who
d
just
be
fire
by
the

emperor
of

and
if
they
could
get
past
that
how
on
earth
could
they
persuade
the
native
new
yorker
to
move
his
family
to
chicago
dimon
s
response
when
he
be
first
contact
about
the
opportunity
wasn
t
encourage
chicago
chicago
contrary
to
the
popular
version
of
the
story
in
which
he
show
up
and
wowed
his
prospective
employer
from
day
one
dimon
have
an
initial
meeting
with
the
board
of
bank
one
in
chicago
for
which
he
admits
he
be
unprepared
a
rare
occurrence
and
evidence
of
his
noncommittal
outlook
at
the
begin
of
the
discussion
luckily
for
him
his
energy
impressed
the
board
which
kept
the
discussion
ongoing
the
first
issue
be
settle
in
a
series
of
meeting
that
begin
in
november
when
dimon
first
met
with
charles
tribbett
iii
and
andrea
redmond
of
russell
reynolds
and
culminate
in
a
two
hour
presentation
dimon
make
to
the
board
in
chicago
in
late
february
he
have
come
to
town
with
a
list
in
his
pocket
of
what
he
would
do
in
his
first
day
on
the
job
much
of
it
revolve
around
vigorous
cost
cut
that
include
write
down
and
layoff
at
this
point
the
board
member
understood
that
they
need
a
leader
willing
to
do
the
defer
dirty
work
of
integrate
all
their
acquisition
and
dimon
blew
them
away
with
his
focus
and
attention
to
detail
james
crown
who
have
come
back
to
chicago
to
work
for
his
family
s
investment
business
in
after
work
for
salomon
brother
call
his
own
connection
in
new
york
for
the
book
on
dimon
an
extremely
demand
bos
white
hot
intelligence
do
not
suffer
fool
gladly
a
strong
leader
who
want
a
strong
team
although
dimon
be
know
to
be
combative
crown
heard
that
he
also
welcome
be
told
he
be
wrong
finally
and
perhaps
most
important
dimon
refuse
to
play
office
politics
he
didn
t
give
a
whit
where
people
come
from
and
care
only
that
they
have
the
ability
to
do
the
job
at
hand
for
an
institution
paralyze
since
its
inception
by
two
hostile
camp
this
be
a
major
draw
on
the
other
question
whether
dimon
would
actually
move
to
chicago
the
board
member
face
a
challenge
he
be
already
rich
enough
never
to
work
another
day
in
his
life
so
they
couldn
t
necessarily
tempt
him
with
money
and
although
chicago
have
its
charm
ask
any
longtime
new
yorker
to
move
anywhere
be
a
notoriously
difficult
proposition
the
board
member
understood
that
they
might
win
by
appeal
to
dimon
s
strong
desire
to
be
his
own
bos
and
prove
to
the
world
that
he
be
no
mere
sandy
weill
apparatchik
the
question
they
put
to
dimon
be
simple
what
other
major
u
s
bank
would
be
ready
to
bring
in
an
outside
ceo
within
the
next
five
year
citigroup
be
obviously
off
the
list
and
there
didn
t
seem
to
be
imminent
job
opening
at
the
top
of
bank
of
america
wachovia
or
well
fargo
if
dimon
want
back
in
the
game
bank
one
be
his
best
shot
dimon
be
sell
still
the
board
member
have
reservation
they
be
concerned
about
the
effect
of
a
harden
new
yorker
on
their
proudly
midwestern
institution
and
they
certainly
didn
t
want
to
be
a
mere
vehicle
for
dimon
s
large
ambition
which
would
surely
take
him
back
to
new
york
in
due
course
dimon
insist
that
he
be
prepared
to
make
a
total
commitment
to
the
bank
but
the
board
have
heard
that
before
in
the
s
first
chicago
have
hire
barry
sullivan
as
ceo
only
to
see
him
keep
his
residence
in
new
york
and
commute
to
work
midwesterners
didn
t
much
care
for
that
meanwhile
dimon
have
to
deal
with
his
own
family
ask
three
teenage
daughter
to
move
to
chicago
be
no
small
request
in
this
he
prove
to
be
as
shrewd
a
manager
as
he
be
in
the
office
as
the
parent
of
three
child
dimon
have
discover
that
it
be
important
to
spend
chunk
of
time
alone
with
each
one
in
order
to
bond
and
so
when
his
daughter
start
complain
that
they
didn
t
want
to
move
to
chicago
he
propose
that
the
eldest
of
the
three

then
accompany
him
on
his
next
trip
to
see

a
day
there
and
i
have
the

than

after

he

go
to
stay
here
there
be
at

one
good
reason
to
be
suspicious
the

around
to

wealthy
enough
that
he

buy
another
but
keep
a
multimillion
dollar
apartment
as
a
crash
pad
for
your
brother
doesn
t
exactly
fit
the
profile
of
a
man
know
for
fiscal
prudence

the
first
six
month
at

one
be
not
easy
dimon
say
he
be
surprised
at
the
extent
of
the
company

problem
as
well
as
the
severity
of
the
measure
they
call
for
after

conference
call
with

three
kept
their
hold
rating
on
the

stock
while
another
reiterate
a

there
be
serious
doubt
about
the
safety
of
the

in
the
face
of
a
pronounce
weakness
in
earnings
despite
the
chaos
in

call
the
toughest
year
he

pretty
much
alone
that
whole

more
than

be
obviously
wildly
unpopular
with
shareholder
especially
those
who
own
a

of

dimon
take
grief
for
it

there

no

an

trick
dimon
have
learn
from
weill
in
his
day
at
commercial

he
also
make
a

what
he
call

promotion
during
the
first
year
promote
people
before
he
would
have
in
more
normal
circumstance
because
he
felt
he
have
no
choice
he
and
his
senior
team
turn
mccoy
s
old
office
into
what

nickname
the
lava
lounge
they
furnish
it
with
old
couch
from

yes
a
bunch
of
lava
lamp
this
be
where
they
brainstorm
plan
to
change
the
culture
of
the

no
issue
be
too
small
for
their
attention
when
judy
told

of
a

at
a
walgreen

in

dimon
call
the

told
that
the
problem
have
be
monitor
for
six
month
he
fire
the
vendor
on
the
spot
he
also
change
rule
he
found
ridiculous
at
an
early
executive
meeting
he
walk
into
the
conference
room
with
a
cup
of
coffee

the
old
first
chicago
building

decorate
with
a

one
executive
told
their
new
bos
that
no
coffee
be
allow
in
the
conference
room
dimon
couldn
t
believe
his
ear
i
look
at
my
coffee
i
look
at
him
and
i
say
well
it
be
now
this
style
take
some
get
use
to
for
veteran
bank
one
executive
one
compare
speak
to
dimon
to
drinking
from
a
fire
hose
this
be
not
an
unusual
reaction
his
be
a
manner
of
speak
that
must
be
experienced
to
be
appreciate
dimon
be
not
as
the
greek
historian
plutarch
might
have
observe
the
kind
of
man
who
save
his
breath
to
cool
his
porridge
dimon
later
say
his
most
serious
oversight
during
his
first
month
be
that
it
take
him
precisely
that
long
to
realize
that
bank
one
s
branch
be
open
on
average
for
two
few
hour
than
its
local
competitor
with
billion
and
employee
invest
in
the
retail
business
he
couldn
t
believe
that
he
hadn
t
notice
such
a
simple
fact
but
what
bother
him
even
more
be
that
no
one
have
bother
to
tell
him
that
he
say
be
a
sign
that
the
company
s
dna
be
flaw
when
he
issue
a
diktat
that
the
bank
stay
open
for
longer
hour
he
be
told
that
the
move
would
kill
morale
tough
he
reply
this
be
what
we
do
his
new
colleague
come
to
realize
that
although
dimon
be
sincere
about
open
and
honest
debate
he
be
also
unafraid
to
draw
it
to
a
close
and
make
an
unpopular
decision
you
need
people
who
will
argue
and
fight
but
at
one
point
say
we
re
go
to
take
the
hill
he
told
an
audience
in
late
some
debate
be
chicken
or
steak
it
becomes
time
to
eat
dimon
disdain
the
chronic
hire
of
consultant
and
cut
the
practice
back
to
the
bare
minimum
james
crown
whose
family
have
a
significant
stake
in
bank
one
remembers
one
instance
when
an
accounting
consultant
give
a
long
wind
and
pompous
and
hard
to
follow
presentation
that
left
him
think
maybe
it
s
just
me
maybe
i
m
the
only
one
who
didn
t
get
it
but
dimon
felt
similarly
that
be
a
terrible
presentation
he
told
the
assemble
group
after
the
presenter
have
left
this
be
why
i
hate
consultant
he
picked
up
the
phone
and
call
the
partner
who
have
just
depart
leave
a
message
in
which
he
say
not
to
bother
send
a
bill
because
the
presentation
have
be
a
waste
of
time
a
few
minute
later
he
call
back
and
say
the
call
i
just
make
i
wasn
t
kid
i
m
not
pay
for
it
he
eventually
toss
out
consultant
from
trammel
crow
which
at
one
point
have
have
people
work
in
bank
one
s
office
in
he
eliminate
a
billion
outsource
deal
with
at
t
and
ibm
that
mccoy
have
sign
in
although
he
saw
saving
down
the
road
this
move
wasn
t
a
decision
driven
by
short
term
financial
gain
dimon
considers
information
system
one
of
the
core
competency
of
a
financial
service
company
and
he
thought
the
function
and
any
associate
information
technology
strategy
belong
in
house
dimon
be
vocal
about
his
antipathy
toward
much
of
the
consult
use
by
large
corporation
today
with
the
notable
exception
of
mckinsey
co
it
s
substitute
management
he
say
a
good
housekeep
seal
of
approval
it
s
political
so
if
you
make
a
decision
you
can
say
it
s
not
my
fault
it
s
their
fault
i
remember
at
citigroup
when
we
hire
a
consult
firm
to
do
a
study
about
how
our
capital
be
deployed
i
thought
what
be
wrong
with
us
shouldn
t
this
be
the
job
of
management
shouldn
t
we
understand
capital
i
do
think
consultant
can
become
a
disease
for
corporation
and
i
don
t
say
that
lightly
because
i
really
do
believe
it
we
do
still
use
smart
people
to
do
consult
for
us
but
it
have
to
be
with
a
very
senior
person
and
there
be
no
phase
two
by
that
i
mean
at
the
end
of
the
project
i
have
the
brain
and
they
have
the
money
i
don
t
need
anyone
to
implement
anything
that
s
a
joke
you
can
t
have
outside
people
implement
stuff
inside
company
it
doesn
t
work
and
by
the
way
if
that
s
go
on
what
the
hell
be
your
own
people
do
dimon
knew
how
to
play
hardball
with
customer
too
he
told
nearly
corporate
borrower
that
bank
one
would
no
longer
serve
them
if
they
didn
t
broaden
their
relationship
with
the
bank
beyond
loan
partly
as
a
result
the
corporate
loan
portfolio
shrank
by
about
billion
he
disliked
lending
money
for
rapidly
depreciate
asset
like

largely
take

this

also
do

that

as
cut
the

dimon
have

those

have
always
be
highly

have
serve

he

come
up
with
the

he
would
throw

against

and
jamie
would
be
the
one
to
tell
him
which
one
be
smart
but
that
s
very
different
from
do
it
all
yourself
at

one
dimon
learn
what
it
be
to

he

this
point
the
no

miller
told
an

that

be
a
pain
in

i

i

you

by
the

we

do
by

swirl
about
what
company

might
be
prepared
to
buy
bear
stearns
come
up
in
an
article
in
american
banker
and
that
rumor
be
at
least
partly
on
the
mark
dimon
jim
boshart
and
charlie
scharf
have
spent
some
time
speak
to
bear

include
its
copresidents
alan
schwartz
and
warren
spector
and
its
chief
financial
officer
sam
molinaro
the
problem
james
cayne
the
egomaniacal
head
of
bear
stearns
told
his
board
that
he
would
take
nothing
short
of
a
significant
premium
to
bear
s
share
price
to
accept
an
offer
from
dimon
no
matter
that
an
offer
hadn
t
be
make
in
the
first
place
he
want
a
share
recall
dimon
i
say
jimmy
there
s
no
way
we
could
pay
a
price
like
that
the
logic
of
the
price
wasn
t
even
what
the
company
be
worth
by
the
way
it
be
base
on
some
formula
of
what
jimmy
would
have
make
if
he
stayed
there
five
more
year
i
told
him
a
deal
could
make
sense
for
both
side
but
that
the
price
couldn
t
be
remotely
close
to
that
keep
in
mind
too
that
this
be
the
same
stock
we
end
up
buying
for
a
share
in
an
article
in
forbes
in
may
rough
cut
dimon
rattle
off
a
list
of
just
about
all
the
commercial
bank
dimon
might
consider
buying
include
commerce
bancshares
fifth
third
bancorp
golden
state
bancorp
keycorp
national
city
southtrust

all
dimon
would

be
that
he
have
his
eye
open
we
have
the
capital
we
have
the
management
at
some
point
something
will
come
along
that
make
sense
for
us
people
expect
me
to
come
in
and
start
do
deal
say
dimon
but
that
s
not
me
i

different
you
can
t
start

even
run
our

well
i

no
we
re
go
to
get
this
thing
fix
and
from
that
strength
if
something
make

successor
in
assemble
a
platform
that
give
jpmorgan

a
shot
at

greatness
he
d
be
criticize
for
both
the
timing
and
the
expense
of
his
move
but
he
d
built
the
platform
nonetheless
and
be
ready
to
spend
more
time
relax
at
his
greenwich
estate
the
board
of
the
company
be
ready
for
a
change
as
well
the
problem
be
that
harrison
didn
t
feel
any
internal
candidate
be
strong
enough
to
run
the
company
the
job
require
both
vast
technical
skill
and
leadership
skill
to
succeed
in

tend
to
mean
specialize
in
one
particular
area
and
that
left
most
talented
executive
know
very
little
about
the
rest
of
the
business
but
there
be
an
outsider
who
seem
to
have
all
the
right
ingredient

harrison
and
dimon
begin
informal
talk
in
january
then
in
may
dimon
call
to
say
he
be
in
new
york
and
would
love
to
meet
harrison
the
two
men
have
lunch
in
harrison
s
din
room
at
jpmorgan
chase
and
then
do
so
again
in
july
after
that
thing
start
to
get
serious
and
secrecy
become
a
concern
they
begin
meeting
in
a
suite
that
jpmorgan
chase
kept
at
the
waldorf
astoria
on
park
avenue
dimon
also
join
harrison
one
night
at
harrison
s
home
in
greenwich
as
a
matter
of
course
dimon
have
always
kept
a
one
page
piece
of
paper
that
include
company
his
firm
might
buy
merge
with
or
sell
to
developed
with
the
help
of
his
management
team
and
share
with
the
board
you
have
to
be
careful
though
he
say
i
ve
see
too
many
board
or
management
when
their
own
business
be
do
poorly
they
start
to
bullshit
about
m
a
people
just
fall
into
that
so
we
separate
it
we
review
our
business
and
what
we
re
do
well
organically
that
kind
of
growth
will
get
you
a
high
value
for
your
shareholder
by
the
way
m
a
be
risky
and
tough
so
the
discipline
be
different
you
really
need
to
think
about
the
landscape
to
ask
yourself
what
s
change
in
any
event
at
the
time
jpmorgan
chase
stood
out
as
have
the
strong
business
logic
with
bank
one
fleetboston
have
be
number
one
in
a
theoretical
merger
of
equal
before
it
be
sell
in
this
era
of
intense
consolidation
the
two
ceo
spent
a
lot
of
time
discuss
what
ifs
about
the
future
of
industry
the
fit
between
the
company
seem
solid
on
paper
jpmorgan
chase
could
expand
its
branch
banking
business
in
the
process
reduce
its
dependency
on
its
volatile
trading
and
investment
banking
franchise
and
bank
one
would
be
transform
from
a
regional
player
into
an
international
powerhouse
the
second
large
bank
in
the
country
after
citigroup
dimon
and
harrison
also
predict
billion
in
cost
saving
in
part
from
some
layoff
harrison
knew
by
may
that
this
be
a
deal
he
want
to
do
he
just
need
to
bring
dimon
around
after
all
his
overpay
harrison
be
convince
that
the
market
would
pummel
his
stock
if
he
paid
a
big
premium
so
he
begin
by
insist
that
jpmorgan
chase
pay
no
more
than
the
market
price
for
bank
one
share
dimon
counter
with
a
demand
for
percent
on
top
someone
be
go
to
have
to
give
a
lot
if
the
negotiation
be
to
have
any
chance
of
success
when
the
deal
between
bank
of
america
and
fleetboston
with
its
percent
premium
be
announce
it
appear
that
harrison
would
be
force
to
give
more
in
the
negotiation
but
he
dug
in
his
heel
he
knew
this
be
the
last
big
deal
of
his
career
and
he
would
be
damn
if
he
be
go
to
solidify
a
reputation
for
be
an
easy
mark
besides
jpmorgan
chase
be
enjoy
a
resurgence
profit
jumped
from
billion
in
to
billion
in
with
the
investment
bank
under
david
coulter
give
much
of
the
credit
coulter
have
join
the
firm
in
when
harrison
purchase
the
beacon
group
for
what
it
s
worth
he
be
consider
the
top
in
house
candidate
for
ceo
but
dimon
beat
him
to
it
dimon
later
told
a
group
of
bank
one
employee
that
upon
hearing
of
the
fleet
deal
he
d
call
harrison
and
say
bill
at
percent
i
ll
drive
your
car
harrison
s
response
at
percent
you
could
be
president
before
the
bank
of
america
deal
harrison
felt
he
d
be
make
headway
in
convincing
dimon
that
anything
close
to
a
percent
premium
would
result
in
stock
market
carnage
which
wouldn
t
have
be
good
for
either
of
them
but
dimon
s
override
duty
at
this
point
be
to
bank
one
s
shareholder
who
would
rightly
howl
if
they
suspect
he
be
accept
too
little
from
jpmorgan
chase
in
exchange
for
advance
his
own
career
so
he
push
for
a
to
percent
premium
harrison
be
in
tight
spot
too
the
industry
be
in
the
grip
of
merger
mania
and
if
harrison
didn
t
snap
up
bank
one
someone
else
surely
would
it
wasn
t
just
the
company
that
be
attractive
it
be
dimon
himself
harrison
desperately
want
dimon
as
his
successor
and
start
sweeten
the
term
upon
completion
of
a

the
two
men
agree
harrison
would
remain

while
still
remain

concession
despite
the
fact
that

large
than
bank
one
with

the

plus
harrison

dimon
two

no

enough
jpmorgan

down
for
long
the

that
if
the

climbed
much
far
harrison
would
be
force
to
renegotiate
there
be
ultimately
no
need
for
this
and
the
transaction
get
do
at
a

premium
at
a
subsequent
meeting
with
employee
in
chicago
harrison
praise
dimon
s
negotiate
skill
it
s
be
without
question
the
most
stress
kind
of
time
a
ceo
can
go
through
when
you
re
negotiate
one
of
the
deal
particularly
with
jamie
that
s
also
why
i
look
old
today
dimon
admit
a
slight
hesitation
two
or
three
time
i
felt
deep
anxiety
about
this
deal
he
say
it
s
terrify
do
you
push
the
button
or
not
if
you
don
t
and
this
opportunity
be
go
when
you
want
it
later
you
ve
make
a
horrible
mistake
so
i
push
the
button
a
group
of
shareholder
later
sue
j
p
morgan
harrison
and
dimon
maintain
that
dimon
have
offer
to
sell
his
company
for
billion
less
than
the
deal
price
if
he
could
have
the
top
job
immediately
the
accusation
be
that
harrison
have
thus
overpaid
again
just
so
that
he
could
hang
on
to
his
job
for
two
more
year
both
harrison
and
dimon
deny
any
such
thing
but
the
deal
s
premium
nevertheless
raise
eyebrow
not
because
it
be
big
but
because
it
be
so
small
in
march
wachovia
purchase
southtrust
for
a
percent
premium
among
the
recent
deal
bank
one
have
somehow
sell
out
for
the
small
premium
of
all
dimon
later
admit
that
although
he
d
briefly
consider
sell
the
company
to
the
high
bidder
he
never
test
the
water
not
even
bother
to
gauge
the
interest
of
other
potential
acquirer
such
as
well
fargo
he
justified
the
deal
with
jpmorgan
chase
as
the
best
fit
for
bank
one
others
would
snipe
that
it

also
the

what
the

he
told
the

when

fan
of
bloodsports
lament
that
weill
have
largely
pass
the
rein
to

by
that
point
the
irony
be
that
for
the
second
time
in
a
row
dimon
have
found
opportunity
at
a
company
that
have
be
scar
into
an
ill
fat
merger
by
the
fear
he
and
weill
have
struck
into
the
heart
of
the
competition
while
building

dimon

reveal
that
the

him
about

they
have
take
aim
at
j
p

together
almost
year
before
and
weill
couldn

help
celebrate
the
occasion
even
if
it
meant
more
formidable
competition
for
citigroup
one
word
during
the
phone
call
be
unclear
to
dimon
however
weill
have
say
either
you
finally
get
j
p
morgan
or
we
finally
get
j
p
morgan
there
be
no
more
we
it
be
a
warm
exchange
however
and
the
two
men
share
a
laugh
as
in

time
harrison

repeat
at
a
number
of
leadership
meeting
with
jpmorgan
chase
s
employee
what
help
in
the

be
that
during
their
month
of
negotiation
the
men
have
plan
very
carefully
how
they
would
jointly
run
the

and
have
determine
which
people
be

for

they
have

out

organizational
structure
three

four
level
deep
in

place
dimon
told
his
direct
report
that
if
they
felt
they
have
a
legitimate
disagreement
with
a
decision
he
d
make
they
could
go
and
visit
harrison
together
his
intention
be
to
eliminate
politics
at
the
level
beneath
the

for
fear
that
politics
would
otherwise
destroy
the

in
return
he
get
nothing
but
cooperation
from
harrison
we
both
want
it
to

really
want
a

the

of
thing
i
need
to
do
today
i
want
to
make
sure
i
cover
all
the
topic
i
want
to
talk
to
you
about

incredulous
let
me
see
that
he

after
a
quick
scan
of
the
sheet
of
paper
dimon
threw
it
back
at

dismissively
that
s
not
a
list
he

do
you
want
to
see
a
real
list
he
then
pull
his

laugh
at
their

pass
and
he
hand
more
and
more
power
over
to
dimon
harrison
s
one
disappointment
be
find
out
that
when
you
hire
the
most
confident
man
in
finance
it
s
unlikely
he
s
go
to
ask
for
your
advice
very
often
harrison
use
to
seek
his
predecessor

counsel
out
of
respect
even
if
he
d
already
make
up
his
mind
dimon
didn
t
bother
with
such
pretense
but
if
you
understand
that
you
re
ok
say
harrison
he
doesn
t
waste
time
like
that
the
transfer
of
power
from
harrison
to
dimon
stand
as
one
of
the
cleanest
and
most
orderly
in

response
thank
you
mayo
actually
stew
over
be
call
out
in
public
especially
as
he
didn
t
consider
that
his
rating
of
bank

be
a
failure
he
d
actually
downgrade

for
a

even
though
he

about
it
during

tenure
this
be
still
one
of
the
best
call
he
d
make
in
his

but
he
take
the
high
road
and
say
nothing
two
year
later

when
dimon
make
another
crack
at
his
expense
during
a

up
the

on
the

it
be

call
to
apologize
to
him

he
do
have

undoubtedly
the

stood
out
for
their
ability
to
tell
dimon
when
he
be
wrong
whenever
i
have
really
complicate
stuff
i
give
it
to
jay

have
say
jamie

either
in
agreement
with
you

go
at
you
say
one
jpmorgan

with
one
exception
he
will
sit
down
and
reason
for
hour
with
jay
if
something
be
really
go

you
watch
the
person
who
be
behind
him
be
jay
mandelbaum
when
dimon
roll
into
jpmorgan
chase
his
reputation
be
largely
unchanged
from
that
he
d
have
before
decamp
for
chicago
a
cost
cutter
and
system
integrator
a
man
who
get
excite
by
find
way
to
collapse
different
credit
card
processing
technology
into
just
two
or
three
but
bill
harrison
quickly
realize
that
the
jamie
dimon
who
return
from
chicago
be
different
from
the
one
who
have
left

take
their
toll
on
institution
and
if
people
aren
t
happy
they
will
leave
raise
hell
or
rebel
and
dimon
seem
to
understand
that
a
merger
expose
how
good
a
leader
be
very
quickly
recall
harrison
and
jamie
get
his
hand
around
thing
very
quickly
two
thing
surprised
dimon
out
of
the
gate
the
first
be
a
practical
issue
the
company
s
technology
be
far
less
integrate
than
he
d
thought
the
second
be
about
the
endure
nature
of
a
powerful
brand
we
could
get
off
a
plane
anywhere
in
the
world
and
the
prime
minister
would
want
to
see
us
he
recall
i
knew
the
name
be
good
but
i
didn
t
know
how
good
that
call
card
still
be
the
bank
for
example
have
be
do
business
with
saudi
arabia
s
national
oil
company
saudi
aramco
for
year
if
he
could
get
everything
move
in
the
right
direction
he
would
have
something
he
never
have
at
bank
one
or
at
a
pre
citi
traveler
a
gold
plat
corporate
name
on
which
he
could
capitalize
as
always
dimon
stamp
out
internal
politics
wherever
he
could
in
early
executive
meeting
at
jpmorgan
chase
a
few
people
thought
it
in
their
best
interest
to
try
to
pull
him
aside
afterward
and
whisper
their
thought
about
this
person
or
that
one
he
quickly
make
it
clear
that
he
be
uninterested
in
such
grade
school
tactic
if
you
can
t
say
it
in
the
room
don
t
say
it
at
all
he
told
more
than
a
few
executive
he
later
elaborate
to
fortune
on
his
irritation
with
obfuscation
in
a
big
company
it
s
easy
for
people
to
b
s
you
he
say
a
lot
of
them
have
be
practice
for
decade
he
also
sought
out
people
he
refers
to
as
culture
carrier
those
who
might
give
him
insight
into
the
way
the
old
jpmorgan
chase
have
work
and
where
there
be
room
for
improvement
he
take
these
people
out
one
on
one
for
a
drink
at
the
helmsley
palace
bar
the
lowell
hotel
or
the
king
cole
lounge
in
the
st
regis
hotel
just
to
chat
one
executive
who
be
gay
found
dimon
s
forthrightness
so
disarm
that
he
quickly
come
out
to
his
new
bos
it
take
me
five
year
to
come
out
to
my
previous
ceo
and
year
to
come
out
to
the
one
before
him
he
recall
but
jamie
dimon
have
no
bias
he
s
only
bias
against
dishonest
game
play
people
dimon
occasionally
reveal
his
soft
side
at
a
town
hall
meeting
he
held
with
secretary
in
the
company
s
london
office
one
secretary
stuck
up
her
hand
mr
dimon
she
say
yesterday
my
bos
have
me
work
for
three
hour
half
of
my
afternoon
research
and
book
a
cruise
for
his
mother
think
she
d
just
bust
her
bos
she
wait
for
dimon
s
temper
to
flare
for
his
mother
ask
dimon
yes
she
reply
well
if
it
be
for
his
mother
that
s
ok
dimon
s
report
be
nearly
unanimous
in
point
out
what
they
consider
to
be
the
sincere
warm
man
hiding
behind
his
relentlessness
when
he
smile
they
say
he
be
actually
smile
and
not
offering
up
a
crocodile
smile
what
the
old
hand
of
wall
street
refer
to
as
grin
fuck
he
also
won
over
most
member
of
the
jpmorgan
chase
management
team
who
hadn
t
yet
work
for
him
he
s
really
smart
and
cerebral
with
an
incredible
capacity
for
retain
fact
and
information
say
the
commercial
bank
head
todd
maclin
but
he
s
also
really
good
with
people
if
you
look
at
our
operating
committee
what
you
have
be
a
bunch
of
people
that
aren
t
very
much
alike
but
every
single
one
of
them
will
just
go
to
the
wall
for
the
guy
and
for
very
unique
reason
he
s
get
an
extraordinary
ability
to
connect
with
people
help
them
do
what
he
want
them
to
do
and
also
feel
good
about
work
for
him
early
on
dimon
make
a
valuable
connection
to
bill
winter
a
lowkey
j
p
morgan
veteran
who
ran
the
investment
bank
with
steve
black
winter
and
dimon
have
never
met
before
the
merger
although
j
p
morgan
have
be
view
over
the
past
half
decade
as
a
second
rate
collection
of
talent
winter
be
a
standout
after
the
deal
have
be
announce
but
before
it
be
formally
approve
he
flew
to
chicago
to
meet
his
new
bos
winter
be
blunt
you
have
a
reputation
for
not
like
two
thing
complicate
derivative
and
proprietary
risk
take
he
told
dimon
but
i
can
tell
you
that
s
a
lot
of
what
we
do
so
why
would
you
want
to
merge
with
us
it
s
not
that
i
don
t
like
derivative
dimon
reply
it
s
only
when
i
don
t
understand
them
so
i
want
to
spend
some
time
get
to
know
them
dimon
meant
what
he
say
he
spent
his
first
year
at
jpmorgan
chase
understand
market
he
hadn
t
be
expose
to
and
become
supportive
of
the
company
s
derivative
business
nor
do
i
have
a
problem
with
risk
dimon
continued
but
what
i
can
t
stand
be
when
proprietary
risk
taker
in
a
company
have
preferential
access
to
the
balance
sheet
and
compensation
in
relation
to
other
part
of
the
firm
dimon
explain
to
winter
that
his
problem
with
the
salomon
arbitrage
desk
in
be
that
salomon
s
trader
do
have
preferential
access
to
the
company
s
balance
sheet
and
also
get
paid
more
with
the
result
that
many
of
the
firm
s
smartest
people
want
to
work
on
that
desk
siphon
intellectual
capital
away
from
the
rest
of
the
business
and
when
something
go
wrong
for
the
prop
desk
it
do
so
catastrophically
winter
promise
dimon
that
no
such
preferential
access
would
be
permit
dimon
have
make
a
strong
impression
on
him
so
much
so
that
instead
of
look
for
a
new
job
winter
decide
to
stick
around
black
and
winter
be
name
co
ceo
of
the

bank
in
march
just
over
a
month
after
dimon
s
arrival
dimon
largely
left
the
two
men
alone
for
the
time
be
the
bank
have
suffer
a
large
brain
drain
after
the
merger
with
chase
accord
to
one
estimate
of
the
top
people
at
the
firm
be
go
within
month
of
the
deal
but
black
and
winter
be
rebuild
and
put
together
a
revamped
management
team
hire
a
trading
standout
matt

from
the

they
remove
a
number
of
management
layer
to
enhance
decision
make
and
also
revamped
the
company
s
credit
system
in
the
hope
of
more
effectively
control
their
exposure
winter
focus
primarily
on
the
company
s
credit
and
trading
business
out
of
the
london

while

oversaw

as

security
business

tend
to
be
a
recipe
for
disaster
in
almost
any
industry
but
black
and
winter
struck
a
workable
balance
they
also
told
dimon
that
if
either
of
them
appear
to
be
try
to
stab
the
other
in
the
back
he
should
fire
them
both
one
area
that
need
no
rebuild
whatsoever
be
the
company
s
derivative
business
jpmorgan
chase
have
long
held
a
dominant
position
in
all
manner
of
derivative
in
the
company
be
the
top
player
in
interest
rate
option
interest
rate
swap
and
credit
and
equity
derivative
and
at
the
time
of
the
merger
it
held
trillion
in
notional
derivative
contract
more
than
half
the
derivative
held
by
u
s
bank
and
trust
company
a
lot
have
be
make
of
this
fact
but
dimon
have
by
that
point
come
around
to
the
argument
that
derivative
be
a
good
business
for
the
firm
provide
the
risk
and
exposure
be
monitor
rigorously
for
starter
the
notional
amount
be
almost
irrelevant
number
when
collateralization
and
net
between
jpmorgan
chase
and
its
customer
be
account
for
the
company
s
net
derivative
receivables
at
the
time
be
actually
far
small
at
billion
that
be
still
a
large
number
but
not
an
outsize
one
compare
with
the
rest
of
the
industry
morgan
stanley
for
example
held
billion
in
net
receivables
at
the
time
and
goldman
sachs
billion
both
have
far
small
balance
sheet
as
well
so
jpmorgan
chase
be
actually
take
on
less
risk
relatively
speak
still
the
assumption
use
in
get
to
that
billion
be
fraught
with
possible
risk
if
the
investment
bank
s
risk
manager
be
off
on
that
trillion
by
just
percent
that
s
the
equivalent
of
billion
or
three
time
the
value
of
the
entire
company
in
early
much
have
be
make
by
that
point
about
warren
buffett
s
letter
to
the
shareholder
of
berkshire
hathaway
in
in
which
he
write
in
my
view
derivative
be
financial
weapon
of
mass
destruction
carry
danger
that
while
now
latent
be
potentially
lethal
but
as
he
also
write
in
the
letter
he
agree
it
be
true
that
derivative
security
allow
for
dispersion
of
risk
by
market
participant
not
inclined
to
shoulder
it
dimon
saw
both
side
of
the
argument
as
well
and
consider
it
a
valuable
business
for
his
company
to
be
in
six
year
later
berkshire
hathaway
reveal
substantial
derivative
holding
on
its
own
balance
sheet
position
buffett
have
personally
establish
because
of
what
he
saw
as
mispricings
in
the
market
i
ll
continue
to
say
that
use
widely
derivative
pose
systemic
risk
say
buffett
but
that
doesn
t
mean
they
re
evil
we
re
hold
billion
or
billion
of
cash
attributable
to
ours
and
i
think
these
will
work
fine
for
me
and
not
so
well
for
the
other
guy
in
his
letter
to
shareholder
dimon
show
that
his
own
position
have
not
change
either
with
proper
management
systemic
risk
create
by
derivative
can
be
dramatically
reduce
without
compromise
the
ability
of
company
to
use
them
in
manage
their
exposure
he
write
never
one
to
lack
swagger
steve
black
have
told
anyone
who
would
listen
after
the
merger
between
j
p
morgan
and

that
he
be
go
to
build
world
class
capability
in
part
of
the
business
where
they
be
deficient
he
d
be
convince
that
many
of
the
previous
decade
s
merger
have
be
nothing
more
than
stack
doughnut
the
hole
in
the
business
that
have
exist
before

jpmorgan

take
its

business
to
the
top
five
within
three
year

to
the

scoffed
at
on

at
the
time

didn

even
appear
in
the
league

in
it
grabbed
the

four

up
from

the

and
in
it

to
leave
well
enough
alone

do

that
wasn

jamie

way
at
all

once

to
me
in

of
a
disagreement
don

change
your

unless
you
change
your

ultimately
convince

by
appeal
to
dimon
s
own
think
on
another
issue
dimon
have
shut

he
believe
that

be
crucial
to
win
staley
plead
with

that
outsource

be
in

do
the
same
thing
if
you
outsource
it
you
re
just
go
to
be
average
staley
say
after
battling
for
nearly
a
year
on
the
issue
dimon
finally
relent
he
want
to
understand
your
business
say
staley
and
he
ll
give
you
his
view
but
it
be
your
business
unless
you
don
t
perform
staley
s
one
concern
be
that
dimon
would
be
unable
to
resist
buying
a
brokerage
firm
to
bolster
the
company
s
equity
unit
staley
felt
that
the
brokerage
business
conflict
with
that
of
the
private
bank
his
concern
be
not
unfounded
dimon
have
even
say
in
a
speech
that
if
smith
barney
be
to
go
up
for
sale
he
would
be
an
interested
buyer
my
big
worry
be
that
chuck
prince
would
call
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
and
say
jamie
here
s
smith
barney
recall
staley
how
could
jamie
have
say
no
luckily
for
staley
in
early
citigroup
agree
to
merge
its
smith
barney
brokerage
unit
with
morgan

the
idea
be
officially
off
the
table
with
charlie
scharf
oversee
retail
at

he
and
dimon
institute
their
policy
of
eliminate
across
the
board
bonus
for
branch
personnel
and
redeploy
some
of
that
money
to
top
performer
before
they
come
half
of

manager
earn
a
bonus

to
in
the

the

could
earn

the

nothing

interpret
the
poor
result
as
a
positive
in
that
they
would
allow

to
continue
to
make
change
at
the

american
banker
name
dimon
banker
of
the
year
for
in
large
part
owe
to
the
merger
on
december
he
be
name
to
the
time
cnn
list
of
business
influentials
he
earn
million
for
the
year
versus
harrison
s
million
still
the
nag
question
about
dimon
refuse
to
go
away
do
he
have
the
vision
to
drive
growth
without
acquisition
there
be
only
so
many
bank
one
could
buy
after
all
and
the
integration
problem
could
very
easily
overwhelm
any
inherent
benefit
of
a
deal
dimon
could
bring
cost
down
that
be
indisputable
but
for
the
stock
market
to
take
a
real
shine
to
jpmorgan
chase
he
would
have
to
show
that
he
could
raise
revenue
more
quickly
than
the
competition
and
that
wasn
t
happen
the
combine
company
revenue
rise
a
meager
percent
in
bad
the
return
on
equity
be
a
paltry
percent
well
below
that
of
the
competition

as
begin
the
medium
be
cheer
dimon
on
from
the
sideline
business
week
name
him
one
of
its
manager
to
watch
in
january
and
follow
that
with
an
article
title
dimon
s
grand
design
in
march
but
the
stock
market
be
still
hold
back
its
approval
the
merger
have
be
one
of
three
major
bank
deal
in
and
bank
one
s
former
shareholder
be
lag
in
return
their
stock
be
worth
percent
more
now
than
at
the
time
of
the
deal
versus
a
percent
gain
for
shareholder
of
southtrust
which
have
be
bought
by
wachovia
and
percent
for
shareholder
of
fleetboston
which
have
be
purchase
by
bank
of
america
much
of
the
differential
have
to
do
with
the
low
premium
dimon
have
accepted
to
get
the
deal
do
but
it
be
a
third
place
show
nonetheless
dimon
s
new
colleague
have
by
now
experienced
his
insatiable
appetite
for
detail
there
be
no
number
or
statistic
that
he
wasn
t
interested
in
whether
it
be
the
number
of
ticket
bought
for
a
billy
joel
concert
or
the
number
of
phone
call
people
make
each
day
sometimes
all
that
matter
be
the
detail
he
told
usa
today
sometimes
detail
will
sink
you
ceo
should
drill
down
by
drilling
down
dimon
meant
sit
down
and
spending
three
hour
or
more
every
month
go
through
page
book
prepared
for
him
by
every
division
head
with
the
number
from
the
prior
month
one
thing
jamie
brought
with
him
to
the
company
be
the
commitment
to
understand
a
basic
fact
recall
the
commercial
banking
chief
todd
maclin
and
that
s
that
every
single
risk
you
re
take
can
be
broken
down
to
its
small
component
and
therefore
be
well
understood
all
it
take
be
time
and
effort
dimon
also
brought
the
painful
and
laborious
tradition
of
sit
down
with
the
operating
committee
for
eight
hour
each
year
to
go
over
the
rationale
behind
the
compensation
of
every
single
one
of
the
firm
s
top
earner
upset
with
the
idea
that
other
executive
would
have
input
into
how
to
compensate
their
direct
report
some
manager
complain
to
dimon
don
t
they
work
for
me
he
be
ask
no
they
work
for
the
company
he
reply
how
can
you
decide
what
to
pay
people
if
you
don
t
know
how
other
people
think
about
the
job
they
re
do
despite
the
seem
sense
in
such
practice
wall
street
include
much
of
jpmorgan
chase
before
dimon
arrive
usually
tends
in
the
opposite
direction
toward
secrecy
and
hoard
information
if
you
d
ask
someone
else
for
their
profit
and
loss
statement
before
jamie
institute
this
stuff
they
would
have
told
you
to
go
jump
in
a
lake
say
todd
maclin
it
would
be
like
ask
to
see
their
hemorrhoid
scar
that
s
personal
stuff
they
d
say
how
dare
you
ask
me
to
see
my
p
l
but
now
it
s
like
they
re
all
post
somewhere
on
the
company
s
intranet
there
s
just
so
much
transparency
people
be
also
become
more
familiar
with
his
tendency
for
debate
driven
decision
make
when
you
work
for
jamie
dimon
he
expect
you
to
speak
your
mind
if
you
didn
t
he
d
just
as
soon
replace
you
i
don
t
care
if
we
do
the
trade
or
don
t
do
the
trade
he
told
a
reporter
i
care
that
we
do
it
right
if
you
work
in
a
company
where
you
can
t
walk
in
the
room
and
say
what
you
think
you
create
an
atmosphere
where
you
don
t
do
the
best
you
can
and
where
people
don
t
disclose
thing
jamie
brought
a
level
of
communication
and
consistent
analytical
rigor
to
the
operating
committee
that
be
familiar
to
me
from
the
old
j
p
morgan
but
that
have
go
miss
between
and
recall
winter
and
he
brought
the
fortress
balance
sheet
mantra
the
old
j
p
morgan
have
do
some
thing
right
and
some
thing
wrong
a
fortress
balance
sheet
have
be
one
of
our
tenet
but
we
lose
it
after
we
sell
the
company
to
chase
jamie
brought
it
back
the
emphasis
on
openness
extend
to
what
senior
executive
felt
free
to
say
to
the
medium
whereas
in
later
year
sandy
weill
do
not
tolerate
outright
criticism
dimon
s
report
at
time
seem
to
be
try
to
one
up
each
other
regard
how
much
they
could
get
away
with
in
term
of
the
backhand
compliment
i
m
not
go
to
say
he
s
perfect
steve
black
told
usa
today
but
when
you
re
yell
and
scream
and
stick
your
finger
in
each
others
eye
you
re
treat
jamie
as
one
of
your
partner
not
as
the
ceo
heidi
miller
ceo
of
jpmorgan
chase
s
treasury
and
security
service
voiced
a
similar
point
of
view
he
s
not
a
saint
she
say
he
make
mistake
but
he
let
you
talk
back
and
again
more
about
the
yell
the
yell
be
never
personal
miller
add
he
doesn
t
yell
that
much
anymore
he
would
however
get
directly
involve
in
any
issue
that
he
thought
be
hamper
the

s
ability
to
execute

lose
the
taste
for

dimon
do
not
back
down
what
matter
to
dimon
be
that

get
paid
for
performance

that

in

there

always
some

again
he
be

to
his

it
be
cute
on
one
level
recall
the
analyst
meredith
whitney
but
also
totally
unorthodox
shortly
thereafter
dimon
eliminate
any

spending
at
the
master
golf
tournament
in

georgia

as

be
a
member
dimon
write
the
letter
to
shareholder
in
the

as
evocative
of
warren
buffett
as
ever
todd
maclin
say
dimon
look
at
write
this
annual
letter

address
he
stress
the
need
for
honesty
integrity
and
honor
and
do
the
right
thing
not
necessarily
the
easy
or
expedient
thing
this
be
write
for
an
audience
not
just
reporting
result
and
for
good
reason
everyone
be
watch
jamie
dimon
wait
to
see
what
he
d
do
now
that
he

dimon
come
to
the
conclusion
that
it
be
time
to
really
dial
back
the
subprime
exposure
he
call
billy
king
then
chief
of
securitized
product
i
ve
see
it
before
he
told
king
this
stuff
could
go
up
in
smoke
within
week
the
bank
sell
more
than
billion
in
subprime
mortgage
it
have
originate
dimon
s
intuitive
grasp
which
his
friend
jeremy
paul
have
see
in
high
school
be
serve
him
in
his
role
as
ceo
while
his
manager
handle
their
own
patch
he
monitor
the
big
picture
and
realize
that
something
be
amiss
in
move
his
bank
out
of
the
way
of
the
oncoming
subprime
train
dimon
prove
to
be
an
exception
to
the
great
economist
john
maynard
keynes
s
cynical
observation
that
a
sound
banker
be
not
one
who
foresees
danger
and
avoids
it
but
one
who
when
he
be
ruin
be
ruin
in
a
conventional
and
orthodox
way
along
with
his
fellow
so
that
no
one
can
really
blame
him
dimon
would
not
be
ruin
along
with
his
fellow
if
there
s
one
thing
that
even
dimon
s
supporter
will
criticize
him
for
it
s
that
he
willfully
circumvents
traditional
chain
of
command
thereby
complicate
his
manager
relation
with
their
own
subordinate
he
might
ask
people
for
the
same
piece
of
information
just
so
he
get
it
as
soon
as
possible
but
his
meddling
be
tolerate
because
of
the
result
in
fact
some
people
see
the
meddling
as
one
of
his
more
valuable
asset
all
the
great
ceo
that
i
ve
ever
see
have
this
characteristic
say
his
longtime
adviser
bill
campbell
they
spend
a
lot
of
time
at
foot
they
spend
significant
time
although
hopefully
not
too
much
on
the
ground
and
not
much
time
in
between
the
foot
stuff
be
obviously
incredibly
important
in
term
of
strategy
and
all
that
sort
of
stuff
the
ground
stuff
be
really
important
too
it
help
the
people
that
be
on
the
ground
because
they
believe
they
have
a
leader
that
understands
them
can
talk
to
them
can
touch
them
and
understands
their
problem
but
it
also
throw
the
middle
management
off
because
they
go
god
he
know
that
or
he
know
her
it
s
very
good
for
middle
management
to
have
a
leader
that
s
kind
of
bipolar
in
that
way
jpmorgan
chase
s
head
of
strategy
jay
mandelbaum
point
out
another
unique
trait
that
have
allow
dimon
to
excel
in
the
role
of
chief
executive
when
make
decision
he
be
extremely
adept
at
look
at
all
the
available
information
and
quickly
isolate
the
few
issue
that
matter
he
won
t
overanalyze
a
thing
to
death
either
say
mandelbaum
at
some
point
you
ve
get
to
go
with
your
instinct
the

bank
report
a
percent
decline
in

jpmorgan
chase
s
historically
volatile
trading
result
have
be
tame
but
in
other
regard
the
analyst
community
be
disappointed
we
enter
think
we
be
slip
recall
winter
we
be
miss
a
few
thing
that
s
true
our
commodity
business
be
very
small
but
in
retrospect
it
would
become
clear
that
we
just
weren
t
book
a
lot
of
revenue
on
business
that
would
end
up
prove
very
expensive
if
you
could
go
back
and
take
out
of
our
competitor
earnings
what
be
later
attributable
to
disaster
i
think
we
probably
do
very
well

while
investor
clamor
for
a
big
deal
dimon
actually
shed
asset
sell

jpmorgan

acquire
bank
branch
and
their
associate
commercial
banking
business
from
the
bank
of
new

but
that
wasn
t
stuff
to
excite
anyone
people
be
always
say
i
m
go
to
rush
in
somewhere
and
do
a
deal
say
a
frustrate
dimon
but
that
s
not
me
we
do
a
lot
of
small
little
buy
and
sell
usually
driven
by
the
outline
of
the
business
until
bear
stearns
i
certainly
don
t
need
to
do
a
deal
that
add
some
seventh
leg
to
our
business
unless
it
have
some
strategic
imperative
on
a
call
with
analyst
in
may
he
try
once
again
to
make
explicit
his
view
of
acquisition
opportunity
there
be
three
thing
that
have
to
make
sense
he
say
and
they
be
not
in
order
of
importance
one
be
the
business
logic
there
should
be
clear
business
logic
to
it
the
second
be
the
price
sometimes
there
be
a
price
at
which
you
cannot
make
it
pay
for
shareholder
and
the
third
be
the
ability
to
execute
you
have
to
be
able
to
see
clearly
get
do
what
you
need
to
get
do
whether
it
s
management
or
system
or
marketing
or
culture
or
something
like
that
if
those
thing
make
sense
you
can
then
weigh
and
balance
them
meaning
if
you
have
exceptional
business
logic
and
an
easy
ability
to
execute
you
could
pay
a
high
price
and
conversely
if
those
thing
be
a
little
more
complex
you
want
a
margin
of
error
by
get
a
low
price
of
course
it
doesn
t
always
take
a
splashy
acquisition
to
make
a
pile
of
money
in
the
summer

in
more
than

that
he

a
tradition
at

he

even
after
he

he

succeed
with

the
tightness

dimon
be
more
than
capable
of
hurt
subordinate
feeling
often
in
the
very

way
for
a
second

third
time
he
be
not

he
will
apologize
as
a

his

have
a
genuine
affection

him

cioffi
told

just
percent

it
be
more

percent
and
the

high
the

about

the

at
a
breathtaking
to

at

a

wipe

take

loss
and
be
unable

call
from
his
overnight
lender
this
be
the
lesson
of
leverage
if
you
pay
only

while
borrowing
the

you
can
appreciate
the

himself
in
in

as
brazen
as
it
be
cynical
cioffi
decide
that
the
way
out
of
the
mess
be
to
find
a
few
patsy
to
take
the
toxic

off

he

the

off

jpmorgan

a

some

might
have
balk
at
the
notion
of
effectively
bailing
out
their

but
dimon
be
prepared
to
play
the
statesman
on
a
conference
call
with
analyst
in
october
he
talk
of
take
one
for
the

i
think
it
s
clear
that
there
may
be
asymmetric
benefit
to
different
party
in
the
super
siv
idea
he
say
but
it
s
also
clear
that
it
may
ameliorate
some
of
the
pressure
on
some
of
the

that
be
take
place
today
if
the
system
be
help
we
think
that
s
good
for
everybody
it
s
perfectly
reasonable
that
j
p
morgan
take
part
in
something
like
that
the
plan
never
get
off
the

after
waffle
for
several
week
about
whether
or
not
it
have
any
contractual
obligation
to
provide
liquidity
or
guarantee
to
the
sivs
it
say
it
merely
advise
citigroup
finally
buckle
in
december
and
agree
to
take
billion
worth
of
sivs
back
onto
its
balance
sheet
thereby
obviate
the
need
for
the

we

like
to
write
a
letter
to
the

that

even
if

don
t
go

the

channel
in
which
outside
mortgage
broker
make

pass
them

the

this
be
an
add
dimension
of

the

have
little
control
over
underwriting
practice
that
go
on

although
such

account
for
only
percent

account

they

eventually

the

it
wasn

competitive
in

instead
of
a
deliberate

hadn

shortly
before

brad

be
that
a

that
he
didn

word
jpmorgan

good
fortune
in

those
on
dimon

reject
this
version
of
event
say
that
although
they
have
be
overhaul
their
end
to
end
mortgage
capability
they
didn
t
act
because
they
chose
not
to
in
late
they
notice
that
default
rate
on
subprime
mortgage
be
start
to
pick
up
and
they
therefore
decide
just
as
they
have
when
sell
the
siv
in
that
it
might
be
well
to
sit
this
one
out
instead
of
add
to
their
subprime
risk
they
begin
reduce
it
particularly
through
the
use
of
mortgage
derivative
one
of
the
great
irony
of
the
late
stage
of
the
mortgage
bubble
gillian
tett
point
out
in
fool
s
gold
be
that
demand
be
so
high
for
subprime
mortgage
product
that
it
outstrip
actual
supply
derivative
on
the
other
hand
could
be
make
out
of
whole
cloth
the
only
issue
like
any
financial
product
a
derivative
need
both
a
buyer
and
a
seller
there
be
no
shortage
of
people
who
want
to
own
subprime
risk
but
they
d
have
nothing
to
buy
if
there
be
no
one
who
want
to
sell
it
by
seek
to
hedge
their
own
subprime
exposure
through
the
use
of
derivative
then
jpmorgan
chase
and
others
inadvertently
help
prolong
the
insanity
longer
than
it
otherwise
might
have
be
have
investor
be
limited
to
buying
actual

then
there
s
the
billion

that
no

seem
to
have
notice
and
which
end
up

the

fourth
quarter

in
when
it
lose
half
its

some
executive
at
the
company
have
propose
that
the
bank
actually
begin
invest
in
subprime
product
and
while
the
decision
be
work
its
way
through
the
appropriate
channel
a
unit
of
the
bank
go
ahead
and
purchase
a
billion
subprime
cdo
the
proposal
be
ultimately
reject
but
the
cdo
stayed
on
the
book
winter
refers
to
the
episode
as
an
outright

the

that

how
much
they

he
be
right
although
there
be
always
the
risk
that
a

might
lose
its
access

short

thus

this

happen

this
be
go
to
happen
in
the
next
hour
recall
cavanagh
it
be
more
like

still
theoretical

maintain
that
paulson
and
the

played
dirty
pool
by
change
the

of
a

make
only
the
night
before
dimon
didn
t
see
it
that
way
the
original
goal
of
the
financing
be
to
get
bear
to
the
weekend
at
which
point
he
or
any
other
interested
party
could
consider
buying
the
company
then
there
be
the
exact
word
of
the
press
release
itself
about
which
there
have
be
much
consternation
it
do
not
say
day
financing
it
say
up
to
day
i
ve
always
consider
this
a
moot
point
dimon
say
after
the
eventual
purchase
of
bear
stearns
by
jpmorgan
chase
because
they
be
still
have
a
run
on
the
bank
the
fed
have
lent
them
billion
on
friday
and
we
have
to
lend
them
another
billion
on
monday
we
wouldn
t
have
do
that
have
we
not
do
the
deal
and
the
fact
that
we
d
do
the
deal
wasn
t
even
stop
money
from
continue
to
head
out
the
door
so
they
would
have
never
survive
monday
anyway
even
if
the
financing
have
be
for
day
it
didn
t
matter
it
be
over
what
s
more
the
lending
from
the
fed
be
collateralize
which
meant
that
bear
stearns
need
to
have
asset
to
pas
on
the
bear
people
seem
surprised
recall
cavanagh
but
i
have
no
idea
why
they
didn
t
have
the
collateral
anyway
by
the
next
morning
schwartz
and
molinaro

have
the
resource
to
buy

but
have
no
reason
to
the
two

overlap
too
much
but
jpmorgan

be
dive
headlong
into
the
deal
dispatch
team
from
various
department
to
meet
with

s
official
and
comb
through
their
book
the
member
of
jpmorgan

s
team
be
still
not
entirely
sure
that
they
be
interested
they
be
merely
do
due
diligence
at
breakneck
speed
while
several
hundred
top
executive
scurry
around
the
company
s
own
headquarters
at
park
avenue
hold
meeting
some
people
have
be
call
in
to
work
on
the
deal
globally
steve
black
be
think
to
himself
didn
t
we
just
do
this
and
they
have
when
bear
s
hedge
fund
have
run
into
trouble
in
the
summer
of
executive
at
jpmorgan
chase
have
take
a
pas
on
buying
the
firm
six
month
later
thing
be
even
bad
for
the
struggle
investment
bank
so
what
be
the
point
of
go
through
the
motion
again
we
d
be
through
it
the
past
summer
black
recall
and
we
d
told
them
that
we
d
be
interested
if
they
want
us
to
make
some
sort
of
convertible
investment
in
their
prime
brokerage
business
alan
s
response
have
be
why
would
we
do
that
wouldn
t
it
make
the
whole
franchise
worth
less
i
d
say
that
s
a
fair
point
but
consider
this
us
register
some
interest
if
you
guy
get
to
that
point
we
have
do
the
work
on
whether
we
d
be
interested
in
the
whole
bank
and
the
consensus
be
it
wasn
t
worth
all
the
aggravation
certain
piece
fit
well
but
the
rest
of
it
would
have
be
too
time
consume
to
integrate
plus
at
the
kind
of
price
bear
be
likely
to
get
it
wouldn
t
give
us
much
in
the
end
the
certain
piece
he
be
refer
to
be
bear
s
prime
brokerage
operation
estimate
to
be
worth
about
billion
its
clearing
business
and
its
energy
and
commodity
division
there
be
also
the
building

at
the
height
of
the
commercial
real
estate
market
in
manhattan
bear
s
headquarters
at
madison
avenue
be
worth
an
estimate
billion
jpmorgan
chase
have
recently
announce
with
mayor
michael
bloomberg
and
governor
eliot
spitzer
its

in
downtown
manhattan
on
the
site
of
the
old

bank
building
which
have
be
condemn
after
if
jpmorgan
chase
could
nab
bear
s
building
it
would
save
itself
a
whole
different
kind
of
aggravation
we
could
have
take
five
year
and
spent
billion
to
build
a
new
building
or
just
say
who
care
about
the
rest
of
bear
stearns
let
s
just
get
the
freak
building
recall
one
jpmorgan
chase
executive
i
kept
say
guy
we
have
to
get
that
building
the
bear
building
be
even
shape
like
an
octagon
the
symbol
of
chase
at
saturday
morning
steve
black
and
mike
cavanagh
quiz
each
of
the
due
diligence
team
on
how
much
downside
they
saw
even
if
jpmorgan
chase
be
to
pick
up
bear
stearns
for
a
single
dollar
be
there
enough
value
in
the
bear
business
they
want
to
know
to
absorb
the
pain
that
would
come
along
with
unload
or
hedge
all
the
toxic
and
unwanted
asset
the
number
thrown
out
be
all
ballpark
estimate
billion
worth
of
loss
here
million
there
the
goal
be
to
come
up
with
a
raw
total
of
the
de
risk
cost
and
lawsuit
that
would
undoubtedly
come
with
the
deal
this
approach
be
dimonology
dwell
on
the
downside
of
a
potential
deal
before
entertain
the
upside
he
kept
the
board
inform
of
every
change
in
their
think
as
well
and
didn
t
get
too
far
out
ahead
of
us
recall
jpmorgan
chase
s
director
william
gray
he
inspires
great
trust
that
way
what
we
read
in
the
paper
be
old
news
for
us
he
raise
every
problem
that
could
occur
we
could
never
walk
out
and
say
he
never
told
us
about
this
or
that
by
the
afternoon
the
team
from
j
c
flower
have
a
contingent
bid
ready
billion
for
percent
of
a
recapitalized
bear
stearns
equity
the
equivalent
of
about
a
share
include
the
billion
or
so
new
share
that
would
have
to
be
issue
provide
that
flower
could
line
up
billion
in
financing
to
cover
bear
s
short
term
cash
need
round
up
that
much
in
such
a
short
time
be
a
long
shot
but
at
that
point
it
be
all
bear
have
a
few
hour
later
steve
black
and
the
head
of
investment
banking
doug
braunstein
walk
over
to
bear
stearns
to
speak
to
schwartz
and
gary
parr
bear
s
stock
have
close
at
on
friday
but
black
have
bad
news
for
the
two
men
jpmorgan
chase
hadn
t
be
able
to
do
as
much
work
as
they
d
hop
say
black
and
so
there
would
be
no
firm
offer
that
even
but
their
work
have
lead
them
to
one
obvious
conclusion
if
you
guy
be
think
that
we
re
go
to
be
interested
anywhere
close
to
where
you
close
or
god
forbid
a
premium
then
we
should
just
send
everybody
home
right
now
because
it
s
not
even
go
to
be
close
he
add
you
need
to
tell
us
now
that
it
s
worth
the
effort
to
keep
work
we
re
think
of
somewhere
from
to
a
share
schwartz
feel
that
he
be
out
of
option
in
any
event
told
black
to
keep
work
a
short
time
later
schwartz
call
dimon
he
want
to
know
whether
dimon
consider
this
a
hell
or
high
water
deal
in
other
word
if
schwartz
ask
his
board
for
approval
he
need
to
know
that
dimon
be
serious
about
get
it
do
and
wouldn
t
start
add
condition
after
the
fact
dimon
told
schwartz
that
he
d
kept
his
own
board
apprise
of
the
process
and
he
would
be
surprised
if
they
didn
t
give
him
their
support
when
it
come
time
to
pull
the
trigger
schwartz
say
he
d
meet
with
his
board
and
be
in
touch
in
the
morning
schwartz
and
parr
update
bear
s
director
on
the
progress
of
the
negotiation
although
disappointed
at
the
low
level
of
the
offer
the
board
member
agree
to
continue
pursue
both
they
knew
that
christopher
flower
be
unlikely
to
be
able
to
line
up
billion
of
financing
overnight
bear
stearns
after
all
have
be
unable
to
do
the
very
same
at
p
m
the
jpmorgan
chase

held
another
roundtable
discussion
to
get
update
from
their
due
diligence
team
dimon
slip
into
the
meeting
every
now
and
then
sat
down
listen
for
a
few
minute
and
then
left
without
interrupt
his
casual

and
a
black

one

i
guess
he
thought
he
look
cool
but
he
didn
t
the
head
of
j

be
forecasting
billion
in
loss
from
unwind

position
fine
say
cavanagh
call
it
billion
a
few
hour
later
with
more
information
stream
in
source
say
the
number
be
at
billion
and
move
high
jpmorgan
chase
s
executive
eventually
estimate
that
the
total
cost
of
the
deal
beyond
the
purchase
price
itself
would
be
billion
they
raise
that
number
to

decide
to
sleep
on
it
and
get
back
to
work
the
next
morning
even
among
those
who
support
the
deal
there
be
strong
sentiment
that
buying
bear
stearns
on
such
short
notice
be
crazy
never
in
history
have
anyone
try
to
take
over
a
billion
balance
sheet
in
just
a
few
day
especially
one
that
be
surely
full
of
hole
what
s
more
the
company
s
executive
have
earn
a
reputation
for
be
cautious
and
this
deal
be
anything
but
not
only
be
there
the
question
of
what
bear
s
asset
be
actually
worth
there
be
also
what
might
be
term
the
heisenberg
principle
of
market
uncertainty
by
the
very
act
of
step
in
to
save
bear
jpmorgan
chase
would
change
the
value
of
the
company
and
its
holding
and
not
in
a
positive
direction
throughout
the
day
cavanagh
have
try
to
stay
optimistic
tell
himself
that
they
need
to
give
the

serious
shot
at

in
the

what

he
thought
to
himself
the
next
morning
his
thought
have
solidify
we
can
t
do
this
he
told

finally

to
find
that
cavanagh
be
not
the
only
one
sour
on
the
deal
the
first
issue
be
bear
s

although
bear
stearns
have
told
jpmorgan
chase
that
about
billion
be
at
risk
of
far
deterioration
the
jpmorgan
chase
team
have
conclude
that
the
number
be
likely
to
be
closer
to
billion
and
it
wasn
t
just
the
sheer
amount
that
scar
the
team
the
fact
that
it
be
a
continually
move

no
one
bad
yet
an
article
in
the
sunday
new
york
time
by
the
influential
columnist
gretchen
morgenson
add
another
dimension
to
the
deal
in
this
article
rescue
me
a
fed
bailout
cross
a
line
she
call

s
version
of
drexel
burnham
lambert
the
anything
go
s
junk

shop
morgenson
wonder
what
the
merit
be
in
save
a
firm
that
have
give
its
competitor
the
middle
finger
during
the
ltcm
bailout
have
be
convict
of
aid
s
bucket
shop
that
defraud
investor
and
then
have
go
whole
hog
on
subprime
it
become
a
reputational
issue
for
us
recall
one
jpmorgan
chase
executive
she
be
basically
say
if
you
re
ever
go
to
let
somebody
go
down
these
be
the
dirtbags
that
you
should
let
go
down
they
have
a
completely
different
culture
than
ours
alan
schwartz
might
tell
you
that
the
two
place
would
really
fit
together
but
that
s
just
not
the
case
the
two
culture
be
degree
apart
after
discuss
the
time
s
story
steve
cutler
and
jes
staley
repeat
their
concern
this
time
they
weren
t
outnumber
both
black
and
cavanagh
have
switch
side
the
executive
convene
another
roundtable
and
the
result
be
a
thumb
down
a
small
contingent
then
go
to
inform
dimon
that
they
consider
it
irresponsible
to
do
such
a
risky
deal
dimon
agree
with
his
team
and
suggest
make
a
series
of
call
dimon
would
call
geithner
and
paulson
black
would
call
schwartz
and
doug
braunstein
would
call
gary
parr
with
schwartz
on
the
phone
black
be
blunt
look
alan
i
know
what
we
say
last
night
but
we
ve
get
more
information
now
and
we
re
not
go
to
do
a
transaction
at
the
level
we
be
talk
about
more
to
the
point
i
m
not
even
sure
we
can
even
do
a
transaction
at
all
whatever
option
you
may
have
be
pursue
you
should
keep
pursue
them
and
not
count
on
us
to
be
there
black
continued
alan
you
know
me
well
i
m
not
bullshitting
you
this
be
not
a
negotiate
tactic
do
not
count
on
us
it
s
not
just
a
question
of
price
anymore
braun
stein
deliver
a
similar
message
to
parr
geithner
step
out
of
a
meeting
to
take
dimon
s
call
the
discussion
be
brief
dimon
explain
to
geithner
that
the
risk
be
too
great
for
jpmorgan
chase
to
buy
the
company
on
its
own
this
wasn
t
a
negotiate
posture
dimon
later
testify
in
front
of
the
senate
it
be
the
plain
truth
geithner
be
in
a
pinch
despite
all
the
subsequent
description
of
him
as
a
dapper
young
bureaucrat
in
training
he
have
nevertheless
fail
to
rustle
up
any
far
interest
for
the
fail
bank
and
be
face
a
botch
rescue
operation
as
the
first
notable
moment
of
his
career
whatever
black
and
dimon
say
it
certainly
seem
like
a
tactical
move
at
the
time
and
when
geithner
call
back
a
few
minute
later
and
urge
dimon
to
keep
try
to
get
a
deal
do
he
be
essentially
signal
to
dimon
that
he
now
have
negotiate
leverage
over
both
bear
stearns
and
the
fed
which
both
have
their
back
to
the
wall
at
the
same
time
geithner
be
make
it
clear
that
this
be
a
deal
that
have
to
happen
even
jamie
dimon
knew
it
wasn
t
a
smart
move
to
say
no
to
the
government
a
third
time
at
that
point
i
think
people
kind
of
knew
that
this
be
something
we
need
to
do
say
a
member
of
jpmorgan
chase
s
operating
committee
with
the
asian
market
opening
at
p
m
everybody
knew
that
bear
have
to
announce
something
or
risk
an
implosion
of
the
firm
and
conceivably
of
the
financial
system
itself
bear
s
plan
b
be
a
deal
with
jpmorgan
chase
and
there
be
no
plan
c
there
just
wasn
t
any
other
great
alternative
recall
mike
cavanagh
in
the
end
we
have
to
figure
out
a
way
to
facilitate
us
buying
them
a
number
of
former
bear
stearns
executive
view
the
event
that
sunday
as
brinksmanship
on
dimon
s
part
dimon
chafe
at
the
notion
point
out
that
no
one
have
ever
have
to
carry
out
such
a
massive
amount
of
due
diligence
with
such
haste
we
have
literally
hour
to
do
what
normally
take
a
month
this
be
not
in
other
word
the
kind
of
predator
prey
situation
that
dimon
have
be
prepare
for
since
he
arrive
at
jpmorgan
chase
a
thoughtful
man
who
luxuriates
in
rigorous
analysis
he
be
be
ask
to
put
his
own
company
at
risk
because
another
firm
have
played
too
fast
and
too
loose
another
firm
it
bear
repeat
that
he
d
pass
on
buying
just
six
month
before
recall
dimon
s
three
component
of
a
successful
deal
business
logic
the
ability
to
execute
and
price
in
this
instance
the
business
logic
be
a
mixed
bag
buying
bear
would
give
jpmorgan
chase
a
few
asset
it
want
but
would
also
saddle
it
with
some

most
certainly
do
not
the
ability
to
execute
be
totally
unknown
especially
on
such
short
notice
bear

where

and
human
capital
be
paramount
both
be
critical

in

event
the
situation
certainly
wasn

go
to
be

then
the

more
and
because
jamie
dimon

that
s
exactly
what
it
do

little
after

secretary
of

hank
paulson
call
dimon
in
his
office
dimon
told
paulson
that
jpmorgan
chase
be
mull
over
a
a
share
offer
that
sound
high
to
me
i
think
this
should
be
do
at
a
very
low
price
paulson
reply
why
why
not
the
less
you
offer
the
less
it
s
go
to
look
like
a
bailout
paulson
didn
t
want
to
anger
the
american
people
by
seem
to
rescue
greedy
banker
from
their
own
mistake
he
also
raise
the
issue
of
moral
hazard
the
idea
that
bailing
out
equity
holder
of
bear
stearns
would
encourage
future
reckless
behavior
where
there
be
intervention
i
really
believe
that
the
shareholder
need
to
lose
paulson
later
told
fortune
magazine
bear
stearns
be
a
great
old
institution
but
i
don
t
know
how
you
can
put
government
money
in
there
and
protect
the
shareholder
dimon
reply
that
he
d
be
think
of
the
shareholder
vote
that
would
be
require
at
bear
stearns
and
that
to
go
much
low
would
be
to
risk
enrage
the
very
people
he
need
to
approve
a
transaction
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
wasn
t
that
big
a
deal
so
we
change
it
to
he
recall
on
the
subject
of
moral
hazard
however
he
take
a
slightly
softer
line
than
paulson
i
don
t
quite
get
the
whole
moral
hazard
argument
the
whole
we
ll
show
them
mentality
he
say
so
a
drunk
friend
of
yours
fall
in
a
river
do
you
let
them
drown
no
you
save
them
and
after
you
save
them
you
deal
with
their
problem
no
i
don
t
think
highly
paid
executive
at
any
investment
bank
deserve
to
get
bail
out
but
at
some
point
you
re
just
talk
about

of

don
t
want
me

braunstein
told

that
this

it
to

john

aloud
whether

dimon
credit
for
make
a
gut
decision
base
on
limited
information
you
don
t
have
to
understand
it
perfectly
he
say
you
just
need
to
know
the
outer
limit
a
guy
can
walk
into
a
room
and
you
might
not
know
whether
he
weighs
or
pound
but
you
know
he
s
fat
i
just
felt
i
couldn
t
even
categorize
it
to
that
extent
but
you
can
act
and
we
do
act
with
imperfect
information
if
jamie
told
me
that
the
boundary
of
value
for
bear
be
x
and
y
i
would
feel
he
be
right
i
ve
see
enough
of
his
judgment
to
know
it
s
extraordinarily
good
he
know
what
he
doesn
t
know
but
you
have
to
be
willing
to
step
up
and
take
a
swing
he
know
the
pitch
he
like
he
know
what
he
can
hit
he
s
not
go
to
sit
around
wait
for
the
perfect
pitch
buffett
continued
it
wasn
t
shoot
fish
in
a
barrel
but
if
it
didn
t
work
out
he
could
stand
the
downside
if
it
do
work
out
there
be
significant
plus
he
be
a
very
cool
rational
thinker
i
have
never
see
him
make
a
decision
base
on
emotion
he
have
get
the
background
and
the
mental
equipment
to
make
good
decision
i
like
to
think
that
he
and
i
think
the
same
way
but
i
m
probably
flatter
myself
at
p

in

the
answer
be
not
particularly
clear

for
the
fact
that
the

would
last
a

concession
on
the
term
of

that
dimon
be
outrage
and
that
he
even
threaten
to
send
bear
back
into
bankruptcy
but
cooler
head
prevail
the
guarantee
be
give
dimon
fit
in
another
way
too
in
its
original
language
it
guaranteed
only
bear
s
trading
obligation
that
term
didn
t
cover
all
the
company
s
product
customer
relationship
and
subsidiary
and
a
number
of
customer
continued
to
take
their
business
elsewhere
for
fear
of
suffer
loss
if
the
deal
fell
apart
even
if
he
could
clarify
the
issue
of
the
deal
be
vote
down
dimon
have
to
expand
the
guarantee
if
he
want
to

exodus
look
back
at
the
conference
call
during
which
he
call
pandit
a
jerk
dimon
be
both
unapologetic
and
conciliatory
he
make
a
very
good
technical
point
and
it
be
one
of
the
thing
that
start
cause
us
a
problem
the
next
day
but
even
he
would
say
that
in
hindsight
it
be
probably
an
inappropriate
forum
but
i
never
say
he
be
wrong
no
one
have
ever
guaranteed
someone
else
s
trade
before
not
that
i
m
aware
of
so
it
be
certainly
one
of
the
issue
we
be
concerned
about
in
other
word
pandit
be
right
dimon
told
his
senior
staff
on
monday
that
he
want
to
go
over
to
bear
stearns
as
soon
as
possible
and
talk
to
the
troop
the
response
be
that
he
be
crazy
emotion
be
still
raw
he
be
told
and
it
might
actually
be
dangerous
one
executive
even
put
in
a
call
to
alan
schwartz
plead
with
him
to
call
dimon
himself
and
say
it
be
too
early
but
dimon
argue
that
stay
away
would
be
disrespectful
by
wednesday

another
story
a
short
time

found
he
could
laugh
at
the
absurdity
of
it
all
that
s
the
last
time
that
will
ever
happen
he

dimon
want
to
shrink
the
time
during

would
be
on
the
hook
for

trade
if
the

be
vote
down
second
he
need
more
certainty
that
the
deal
would
close
and
to
that
end
ask
for
the
right
to
buy
new
share
of
bear
stearns
equivalent
to
percent
of
the

psychological
limit
here
he
add

to
me
at

to
renegotiate
its
deal
it
want
jpmorgan
chase
to
take
the
first
billion
in
those
loss
and
then
the
fed
would
take
the
next
billion
the
fed
also
want
jpmorgan
chase
to
guarantee
its
loan
to

in
the
span
of
a
week

but
really
good
negotiator
follow
this
kind

the

it
s
a
mind
set
that
sound
like
a
play
on
word
but
it
isn
t
whereas
schwartz
and
the
board
demand
a

paulson
want
the
price
to
stay
at
the

be
at

of
fall
apart
bizarrely
over
a
number
dimon
himself
consider
beside
the
point
it
be
irrelevant
to
me
dimon
recall
the
only
number
that
matter
be
how
much
money
we
be
go
to
lose
de
risk
the
thing
not
the
per
share
price
we
paid
in
other
word
if
the
company
saw
billion
in

associate
with
the

the
total
price
it
be
pay
be
or
plus
in
cost
per

or
to
so
the
nominal
price
per

really
didn
t
matter
too
much
by
the
end
of
the
year
with
the
cost
of
de
risk
approach
billion
the
comprehensive
cost
per
bear
share
turn
out
to
be
about
paulson
finally
relent
on
sunday
freed
to
raise
his
bid
to
a
share
for
a
total
of
billion
dimon
get
the
guarantee
change
he
also
bought
percent
of
the
company
without
have
to
submit
to
a
shareholder
vote
like
the
earlier
request
of
percent
this
significant
portion
actually
violate
the
new
york
stock
exchange
rule
no
matter
dimon
have
the
entire
government
on
his
side
and
the
rule
be
waive
the
same
day
the
new
deal
be
announce
jpmorgan
chase
bought
million
share
for
per
share
by
the
time
of
the
actual
shareholder
vote
in
may
the
company
own
percent
of
bear
s
stock
at
the
time
dimon
didn
t
publicly
admit
that
his
team
make
a
mistake
in
the
original
agreement
with
bear
stearns
but
he
didn
t
have
to
the
renegotiate
deal
admit
it
for
him
we
didn
t
anticipate
that
we
be
leave
optionality
in
the
hand
of
the
shareholder
he
recall
in
other
word
those
shareholder
weren
t
face
a
binary
choice
of
or
per
share
it
be
or
perhaps
more
that
they
could
just
keep
voting
against
the
deal
in
the
hope
that
thing
might
recover
we
didn
t
make
the
deal
airtight
in
hindsight
we
should
have
make
that
guarantee
shorter
mike
cavanagh
be
also
philosophical
about
have
have
to
go
back
to
the
negotiate
table
we
d
latch
ourselves
to
bear
stearns
at
that
stage
with
the
guarantee
he
recall
so
it
be
worth
it
to
us
the
subsequent
weekend
to
get
more
certainty
around
the
outcome
the
one
risk
the
government
couldn
t
help
us
with
be
the
risk
that
shareholder
would
vote
the
deal
down
so
we
get
a
pound
of
flesh
extract
from
us
and
take
it
to
a
share

on
march
the
day
the
new

be
announce
standard
poor

raise

that

day
jimmy

a
total
of

the
final
vote
on
the

be
to
be
in

and
cayne
have
now
ensure
that
he
wouldn
t
have
to
bring
himself
to
vote
on
a
deal
he
would
never
have
do
have
he
felt
he
have
any
choice
his
old
bos
alan

who
be
still
a

at

doesn
t

he

greenberg
say
in
an
interview
with
the
new
york
time
admit
that
the
deal
have
not
be
charity
jpmorgan
chase
have
kept
the
interest
of
its
own
shareholder
paramount
in
negotiation
dimon
nevertheless
continued
to
push
the
notion
that
he
d
do
what
he
d
do
for
the
good
of
the
country
that
jpmorgan
chase
be
a
responsible
corporate
citizen
when
he
testify
in
front
of
the
senate
banking
committee
on
april
he
wrap
up
his
prepared
remark
in
a
sweep
conclusion
about
the
benefit
of
the
deal
bear
stearns
would
have
fail
without
this
effort
and
the
consequence
could
have
be
disastrous
the
idea
that
the
bear
stearns
fallout
would
have
be
limited
to
a
few
wall
street
firm
just
isn
t
so
people
all
over
america
union
member
retiree
small
business
owner
and
our
parent
and
child
be
now
invest
in
the
financial
system
through
pension
k
s
mutual
fund
and
the
like
a
bear
stearns
bankruptcy
could
well
have
touch
off
a
chain
reaction
of
default
at
other
major
financial
institution
that
would
have
shaken
confidence
in
credit
market
that
already
have
be
batter
and
it
could
have
make
it
harder
for
home
buyer
to
get
mortgage
harder
for
municipality
to
get
the
fund
they
need
to
build
school
and
hospital
and
harder
for
student
who
need
loan
to
pay
tuition
moreover
such
a
cascade
of
trouble
could
have
far
depressed
consumer
confidence
and
consumer
spending
result
in
widespread
job
loss
and
accelerate
the
current
economic
downturn
dimon
give
a
polished
performance
in
front
of
the
senate
without
a
hint
of
the
cockiness
that
he
usually
can
t
hide
when
he
be
ask
obvious
question
watch
the
testimony
on
television
mike
ingrisani
his
high
school
english
teacher
thought
to
himself
no
question
that
s
the
jamie
i
knew
albeit
refine
to
the
nth
degree
wall
street
and
the
financial
medium
focus
on
who
have
be
the
chief
beneficiary
of
the
government
intervention
bear
stearns
or
jpmorgan
chase
itself
jpmorgan
chase
be
a
huge
lender
to
bear
and
be
also
its
clearing
bank
a
default
by
the
investment
bank
would
have
cost
it
dearly
regardless
of
the
response
of
the
broader
market
if
bear
s
demise
have
start
a
cascade
of
default
as
some
analyst
have
fear
jpmorgan
chase
the
large
player
in
the
trillion
market
for
credit
default
swap
could
have
see
any
number
of
trading
partner
go
bust
so
even
if
save
bear
have
save
everyone
the
think
go
save
bear
may
have
save
jpmorgan
chase
a
lot
more
than
most
one
senior
executive
call
the
issue
a
matter
of
splitting
hair
and
say
the
focus
be
on
the
good
of
everyone
even
if
everyone
by
definition
include
jpmorgan
chase
our
issue
wasn
t
our
exposure
to
bear
stearns
which
show
up
in
numerous
press
report
he
say
it
be
what
we
thought
could
happen
to
the
market
if
bear
go
out
on
monday
we
be
pretty
sure
lehman
would
be
out
on
tuesday
and
then
the
only
question
be
which
firm
would
be
next
executive
from
dimon
on
down
also
lash
out
at
those
who
thought
that
the
billion
conduit
make
the
deal
at
all
risk
free
or
easy
for
jpmorgan
chase
we
take
on
a
shitload
of
risk
say
one
senior
executive
the
fed
take
billion
we
take
billion
and
people
wise
the
culture
do
not
mix
we
have
risk
meeting
for
day
with
jamie
in
which
we
go
over
everything
our
position
our
exposure
and
our
response
to
potential
crisis
their
culture
be
all
about
hoard
information
hiding
shit
and
be
dishonest
it
s
kind
of
like
some
mid
career
goldman
sachs
banker
get
hire
somewhere
else
there
s
invariably
some
turbo
culture
shock
because
the
goldman
moonie
culture
make
them
unable
to
work
at
other
place
and
i
ll
tell
you
where
we
screw
up
the
most
we
be
way
too
eager
to
treat
it
as
a
merger
of
equal
goldman
sachs
would
have
hire
the
top
to
people
and
fire
the
rest
we
offer
to
hire
half
of
them
and
pay
them
double
until
the
deal
close
which
be
a
waste
of
money
in
the
end
a
rumor
also
circulate
that
jpmorgan
chase
have
make
a
margin
call
on
bear
ask
it
to
beef
up
collateral
on
various
trade
and
exposure
with
the
large
firm
at
the
exact
moment
the
investment
bank
be
unable
to
meet
such
a
demand
thereby
force
it
into
submission
dimon
found
the
suggestion
absurd
some
people
just
don
t
know
what
they
re
talk
about
he
say
there
may
be
some
truth
that
we
be
tighten
our
lending
standard
but
so
be
everybody
and
there
s
no
question
it
reduce
certain
people
s
cash
but
in
this
business
you
have
to
tightly
control
counterparty
exposure
there
be
standard
you
have
to
follow
for
god
s
sake
his
response
didn
t
exactly
put
an
end
to
the
question
whether
a
collateral
call
by
jpmorgan
chase
push
bear
over
the
edge
but
it
suggest
that
if
it
have
be
the
case
well
that
be
a
part
of
do
business
on
wall
street
jamie
dimon
would
not
accept
criticism
for

his
own
company
conservatively
highbridge

the

also
pull
its
asset
out
of
bear
s
prime
brokerage
during
that
first
chaotic
week
but
such
a
move
can
also
be
defend
as
a
prudent
one
that
put
investor
interest
first
the
most
persistent
question
however
be
whether
bear
s
demise
be
brought
on
by
a
cabal
of
short
seller
gang
up
on

that
he
didn

know

that
it
be

for

almost
none

only
three

demand
the

kind
of

they
have

with
the
previous

they
be
told
in
no
uncertain
term
what
they
could
do
with
their
demand
they
have

that
they
all
thought
they
would
keep
their

share
we
told
them
we
just
bought
you
the
answer
be
no
so
you
either
come
into
our
compensation

or
we
ll
shut
you
down
and
we
end
up

about
percent
of
it
down

internal
grumble
at

when
its

bank
laid
off
thousand
of
its

staffer
shortly
after
the
deal
while
hire
new
one
from
bear
they
laid
off
their
own
people
say
an
executive
who
left
the
company
in
why
would
you
fire
a
single
person
on
your
own
team
the
morale
hit
be
not
insignificant
despite
job
save
offer
many
bear
employee
chafed
at
the
notion
of
work
for
jpmorgan
chase
those
with
other
option
walk
right
out
the
door
bear
stearns
be
an
entrepreneurial
place
and
that
fact
ultimately
cause
its
downfall
jpmorgan
chase
be
view
as
a
widget
factory
where
everything
fit
into
its
own
little
box
that
s
the
smart
way
to
run
an
organization
with
trillion
in
asset
but
it
s
not
a
recipe
for
fun
if
fun
be
what
you
re
look
for
in
a
job
there
be
a
number
of
longtime
jpmorgan
chase
employee
who
say
that
since
dimon
arrive
in
he
have
make
the
place
even
less
fun
his
response
so
what
dimon
told
charlie
rise
that
it
be
unlikely
jpmorgan
chase
would
be
in
the
market
for
another
hour
deal
any
time
soon
if
i
take
a
phone
call
like
that
again
and
call
up
the
team
and
say
we
have
to
go
do
this
again
i
think
they
d
shoot
me
steve
black
who
shoulder
the
large
part
of
the
negotiation
along
with
bill
winter
probably
would
prior
to
this
deal
he
have
always
answer
the
question
as
to
whether
jpmorgan
chase
would
do
a
deal
with
an
investment
bank
simply
over
my
dead
body
continue
he
would
argue
there
be
so
much
overlap
that
combine
the
revenue
stream
would
be
like
add
to
come
up
with
you
also
have
to
effectively
pay
for
the
company
twice
because
of
the
amount
you
have
to
shell
out
to
convince
the
people
you
want
to
come
on
board
in
retrospect
he
say
there
be
four
reason
bear
work
first
it
wasn
t
a
real
full
scale
wholesale
investment
bank
it
have
bit
and
piece
but
it
wasn
t
like
try
to
merge
with
goldman
sachs
or
morgan
stanley
second
they
have
some
thing
we
didn
t
have
like
prime
brokerage
and
the
commodity
business
third
give
the
price
we
paid
we
could
pay
people
to
stick
around
without
it
cost
double
in
the
end
and
fourth
those
payment
weren
t
too
onerous
as
the
market
for
people
be
itself
under
pressure
at
the
time
that
s
why
we
have
an
opportunity
to
create
some
value
here
perhaps
but
it
will
take
longer
than
jpmorgan
chase
have
hop
it
have
estimate
that
the
cost
of
the
deal
would
be
about
half
of
bear
s
book
equity
but
the
cost
turn
out
to
be
all
of
that
and
more
instead
of
a
cost
of
billion
to
de
risk
the
balance
sheet
by
november
the
total
be
closer
to
billion
remarkably
one
source
of
significant
loss
be
a
macro
hedge
bear
stearns
have
against

cavanagh
have
spoken
so
confidently
about
be
too
small
although
dimon
still
project
get
billion
to

in
annual
earnings
out
of

bear
stearns
business
by
the
end
of
the
deal
s
economics
didn
t
look
so
good
anymore
to
say
that
the
deal
be
not
costly
would
be
a
mild
understatement
we
be
sell
into
the
bad
market
environment
ever
and
it
cost
us
a
lot
more
than
we
would
have
want
say
black
a
sore
spot
among
jpmorgan
chase
executive
be
just
how
much
of
that
pain
should
have
be
take
by
bear
stearns
before
the
deal
and
not
by
jpmorgan
chase
afterward
on
the
other
hand
some
part
of
the
deal
have
work
out
exactly
as
plan
there
be
the
building
for

and
even
though
the
prime

unit
continued
to
hemorrhage

in
the

of
the

get

do
it
again
but
differently
have
we
have
a
crystal
ball
about
the

would
have
be
much
more
aggressive
in
term
of
move

out
earlier
we
would
have
sought
a
great
backstop
from

and
we
would
have
be
more
aggressive
when
it
come
to
cut
cost
we
try
to
approach
it
as
a
merger
and
we
be
too
gentle
on
march
dimon
spoke
optimistically
about
what
he
saw
as
the
come
end
of
the
market
s
crisis
his
logic
be
straightforward
massive
de

massive
capital

with
no

and
demand
have
to
come
into
balance
at
some
point
hopefully
in
as
a
result
he
suggest
that
the
financial
side
of
the
market
turmoil
be
probably
already
half
over
at
that
point
he
couldn
t
have
be
more
wrong
the
turmoil
be
just
get
start
in
subsequent
month
the
deal
with

be
eclipse
by
even
big

the

of

the
near
failure
of

the

that
s
as
it
should
have

too
small

in
the

of

just
over
a
year
later
there
be
absolutely
nothing

at

you
cannot

on

that

otherwise

a
theoretical

but
it

quite
possible
that
the

continued

what

once

he

dimon
be
meeting
with
his
operating
committee
in
washington
when
the
news
broke
and
different
group
of
jpmorgan
chase
s
executive
have
make
call
on
secretary

dimon
and
dick
fuld
lehman
s
ceo
have
a
brief
conversation
in
which
dimon
told
fuld
that
if
the
term
be
cheap
enough
his
firm
might
be
interested
in
provide
funding
by
buying
some
prefer
share
of
lehman
but
he
make
no
promise
on
tuesday
september
the
investment
bank
s
co
ceo
steve
black
who
be
in
washington
with
dimon
decide
he
need
to
speak
to
fuld
as
well
our
intraday
exposure
be
massive
and
we
didn
t
have
enough
collateral
to
support
it
black
recall
with
what
be
go
on
in
the
market
any
rational
human
be
would
say
holy
shit
that
s
not
right
so
i
call
dick
and
told
him
we
need
more
collateral
to
continue
to
be
comfortable
with
lehman
we
even
work
with
them
to
create
a
mechanism
so
it
didn
t
have
to
come
right
out
of
their
liquidity
by
agree
to
a
three
day
recall
black
ultimately
ask
for
another
billion
and
after
some
haggle
by
fuld
agree
to
take
billion
fuld
be
still
largely
in
denial
at
this
point
perhaps
because
the
government
have
step
in
to
help
bear
so
why
wouldn
t
it
do
the
same
for
lehman
if
the
situation
come
to
that
point
when
fuld
spoke
to
black
on
tuesday
black
told
him
that
one
of
his
few
remain
option
look
to
be
to
get
a
consortium
of
investor
together
to
rescue
the
firm
as
have
be
do
for
long
term
capital
management
but
the
federal
reserve
would
need
to
get
involve
in
herd
those
cat
and
black
suggest
that
fuld
should
be
get
those
conversation
go
as
soon
as
possible
fuld
reply
that
such
a
move
would
be
terrible
for
lehman
s
shareholder
and
he
didn
t
see
how
he
could
go
ahead
with
it
dick
no
one
be
go
to
help
you
keep
lehman
brother
in
business
just
to
be
good
guy
black
say
they
re
go
to
help
you
because
it
s
in
their
own
self
interest
for
that
to
happen
your
shareholder
be
go
to
have
to
pay
the
ultimate
price
so
then
why
should
i
do
it
ask
fuld
i
didn
t
say
you
should
do
it
black
reply
but
i
m
tell
you
if
you
re
get
close
to
the
brink
that
s
what
you
should
be
think
about
fuld
told
black
that
he
have
be
talk
to
citigroup
s
ceo
vikram
pandit
about
a
possible
investment
from
citi
and
that
citi
have
a
team
come
over
to
comb
through
lehman
s
book
that
night
do
black
want
to
send
his
own
team
i
ll
send
some
people
over

but
i
don
t
think
there
s
go
to
be
anything
we
can
do
for
you
that
even
the
head
of

and
the

chief
john

go
to

and
come

black
s
inclination
there

the
fact
that

black
be
flabbergast
they
have
nothing
to
say
he
recall
they
have
no
plan
they
get
on
the
call
and
say
that
they
didn
t
need
any
new
capital
but
it
be
obvious
that
they
do
and
they
have
some
plan
to
spin
off
their
real
estate
holding
but
that
wasn
t
until
february
and
people
need

exactly
the

thing
and
by
the
end
of
the

exactly
the

find
an

a
substantial
infusion
of
cash
over
the

s
john

and
merrill
s
john
thain
the
goal
be
to
either
find
a
buyer
for
lehman
or
concoct
a
solution
that
would
soften
the
blow
of
a
bankruptcy
there
will
be
no
bailout
for
lehman
paulson
told
the
ceo
the
only
possible
way
out
be
a
private
sector
solution
a
logical
buyer
of
lehman
be
someone
who
want
a
major
investment
bank
and
didn
t
have
one
with
bear
stearns
jpmorgan
chase
have
two
investment
bank
and
so
there
be
no
interest
whatsoever
come
out
of
park
avenue
for
us
the
close
down
would
have
be
astronomical
say
dimon
refer
to
the
mass
layoff
and
shutter
of
duplicate
facility
such
a
deal
would
have
necessitate
although
no
one
officially
acknowledge
that
both
britain
s
barclays
plc
and
bank
of
america
be
take
a
very
serious
look
at
buying
lehman
dimon
like
everyone
in
the
room
knew
the
scuttlebutt
what
paulson
and
geithner
ask
the
assemble
group
to
consider
be
another
solution
in
case
no
deal
come
to
pas
could
the
bank
put
together
a
financing
facility
for
example
or
a
loss
bearing
facility
of
some
sort
that
would
allow
lehman
to
continue
function
the
meeting
be
nearly
a
reprise
of
the
meeting
about
long
term
capital
management
a
decade
previously
three
people
be
at
both
meeting
dimon
john
thain
then
represent
goldman
sachs
and
morgan
stanley
s
chief
john
mack
the
difference
for
dimon
be
that
in
he
be
there
as
sandy
weill
s
emissary
in
he
be
his
own
man
at
one
point
there
be
talk
of
a
billion
financing
package
at
another
every
ceo
in
the
room
be
ask
how
much
pain
his
company
could
bear
if
force
to
eat
a
portion
of
lehman
s
loss
any
one
of
us
would
have
put
in
million
or
some
number
like
that
just
to
stop
the
event
from
happen
recall
dimon
we
knew
it
be
go
to
be
painful
for
the
street
and
for
the
world
the
problem
be
even
if
we
d
gotten
to
some
number
it
wouldn
t
have
be
big
enough
to
stop
it
from
happen
because

call
be
a
huge
blow
to
us
and
he
didn
t
give
a
shit
that
s
not
true
say
dimon
i
spoke
to
dick
periodically
over
those
last
couple
of
week
and
not
once
do
he
complain
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
that
everyone
and
their
mother
be
raise
collateral
on
other
people
and
some
of
our
collateral
call
weren
t
even
for
us
they
be
for
investor
that
we
represent
if
dick
have
ever
call
steve
black
or
me
and
say
hey
this
be
unfair
or
give
us
a
little
more
time
we
absolutely
would
have
consider
it
other
executive
at
jpmorgan
chase
be
less
circumspect
they
didn
t
go
bankrupt
because
of
us
say
one
they
go
bankrupt
because
they
do
nothing
for
six
month
and
then
do
a
fuck
up
conference
call
and
then
they
try
to
blame
david
einhorn
the
fed
and
us
it
s
pathetic
neither
dimon
nor
black
think
fuld
actually
say
what
new
york
have
report
we
didn
t
force
everything
that
we
could
have
say
steve
black
we
could
have
stop
financing
them
but
we
work
with
them
the
idea
that
we
put
lehman
out
of
business
be
just
absolute
horseshit
with
the
perspective
of
time
former
lehman
executive
acknowledge
this
one
investment
banker
who
be
subsequently
hire
by
nomura
holding
in
london
express
the
tangle
emotion
surround
the
demise
of
the
firm
on
the
one
hand
you
could
say
j
p
morgan
be
protect
their
interest
he
say
but
on
the
other
hand
they
be
fully
aware
of
the
implication
of
what
they
be
do
and
you
might
say
they
bit
off
their
nose
to
spite
their
face
by
do
what
they
do
they
knew
they
be
force
us
into
a
bankruptcy
or
someone
else
s
hand
one
way
or
another
they
be
take
out
a
competitor
but
i
bet
they
never
thought
we
d
go
bankrupt
i
don
t
think
anybody
have
any
indication
that
paulson
would
let
us
go
my
sense
be
that
there
s
not
a
lot
of
animosity
toward
dimon
though
maybe
he
be
a
dick
for
do
it
maybe
he
make
a
mistake
but
would
anybody
else
have
make
a
different
decision
i
don
t
think
they
would
have
they
have
fiduciary
duty
and
they
have
the
opportunity
to
step
on
the
throat
of
a
competitor
this
isn
t
little
league
so
you
do
it
if
you
can
in
another
less
widely
note
example
of
jpmorgan
chase
flex
its
muscle
in
september
the
company
briefly
stop
do
business
with
chicago
s
citadel
investment
group
because
of
excessive
poach
of
jpmorgan
chase
s
employee
by
citadel
after
it
hire
a
sixth
person
the
cohead
of
the
investment
bank
steve
black
call
citadel
s
head
ken
griffin
and
told
him
that
jpmorgan
chase
no
longer
want
anything
to
do
with
citadel
one
day
later
when
it
appear
that
the
market
didn
t
buy
the
argument
about
poach
conclude
instead
that
citadel
might
be
in
deep
trouble
and
jpmorgan
chase
be
just
the
first
to
know
black
rescind
the
no
business
order
but
say
that
it
would
be
reinstate
if
griffin
make
one
more
hire
steve
and
i
thought
oh
god
this
be
not
the
right
time
for
this
recall
dimon
it
be
intramural
politics
but
people
be
reading
it
the
wrong
way
it
just
wasn
t
the
right
time
to
make
a
stink
on
our
part
action
take
by
dimon
and
his
investment
bank
coheads
while
both
goldman
and
morgan
stanley
be
under
pressure
in
september
and
october
also
suggest
that
the
criticism
from
lehman
be
unfair
after
morgan
stanley
s
ceo
john
mack
call
dimon
to
complain
that
some
of
jpmorgan
chase
s
new
hire
from
bear
stearns
be
tell
his
client
that
morgan
stanley
be
on
the
verge
of
collapse
black
and
winter
sent
a
memo
to
employee
instruct
them
that
they
be
not
to
go
after
client
or
employee
of
either
morgan
stanley
or
goldman
sachs
use
a
predatory
sale
pitch
what
be
happen
to
the
broker
deal
model
be
not
rational
they
write
and
not
good
for
j
p
morgan
the
global
financial
system
or
the
country
a
memo
be
just
a
memo
but
dimon
be
in
full
agreement
that
s
not
how
you
want
to
beat
the
competition
he
say
we
re
go
to
succeed
because
over
an
extend
period
of
time
we
built
a
good
company
and
not
because
one
of
our
many
competitor
run
into
a
lamppost
and
be
critically
injured
that
s
not
fun
no
one
would
wish
that
upon
them
if
they
get
a
flat
tire
that
s
a
different
story
but
there
s
a
difference
between
the
two
everybody
s
get
their
own
value
system
in
mine
i
want
to
be
bury
with
a
little
self
respect
one
day
as
with
lehman
s
failure
the
word
on
the
street
be
that
dimon
have
push
merrill
into
bank
of
america
s
arm
with
collateral
call
jpmorgan
chase
s
chief
risk
officer
barry
zubrow
have
call
merrill
s
peter
kraus
on
september
to
ask
for
an
additional
billion
in
collateral
from

again
executive
defend
the
move
as
protect
their
shareholder
the
money
never
arrive
merrill
complain
but
they
never
even
give
us
anything
recall
dimon
our
line
be
open
and
the
ceo
of
those
firm
knew
they
could
complain
if
they
want
to
paulson
call
dimon
in
early
september
and
urge
him
to
consider
add
morgan
stanley
to
his
list
of
conquest
for
at
a
cost
of
literally
zero
in
the
hope
of
avert
a
possible
collapse
of
the
highly

pull
their
money
out
of
morgan
stanley
s

unit
and
regulator
be
worried
that
another
bank
run
might
be
in
the
off
this
time
dimon
balk
take
over
a
company
with
so
much
overlap
he
explain
would
result
in
two
or
more
year
of
internal
bloodbath
and
would
be
likely
to
turn
the
company
into
a
decidedly
unpleasant
place
to
work
although
he
covet
the
investment
bank
s
brokerage
subsidiary
dean
witter
it
just
wasn
t
worth
all
this
that
s
too
much
pain
and
distraction
to
get
a
brokerage
firm
he
told
colleague
paulson
be
roundly
criticize
in
the
fall
of
for
what
seem
at
best
a
finger
in
the
dyke
strategy
and
at
bad
a
policy
that
clearly
favor
the
interest
of
his
old
firm
goldman
sachs
the
rescue
of
aig
critic
argue
be
really
a
rescue
of
goldman
sachs
which
have
large
counterparty
exposure
with
aig
goldman
maintain
at
the
time
that
its
exposure
be
immaterial
but
the
controversy
intensified
in
march
when
it
be
reveal
that
the
firm
be
actually
aig
s
large
counterparty
and
have
receive
billion
in
payment
on
underwater
credit
default
swap
from
aig
that
have
essentially
come
from
u
s
taxpayer
jpmorgan
chase
on
the
other
hand
have
kept
its
dealing
with
aig
at
a
much
low
level
because
of
dimon
s
pervasive
risk
management
ethos
others
saw
favoritism
when
paulson
allow
lehman
to
fail
and
then
seem
to
bend
over
backward
to
keep
both
goldman
and
morgan
stanley
from
the
same
fate
it
seem
a
little
more
than
coincidental
that
we
be
the
only
one
they
let
go
say
a
former
lehman
executive
paulson
turn
the
decision
to
let
us
fail
into
this
weak
kneed
my
hand
be
tie
excuse
that
s
bullshit
they
be
change
the
rule
every
day
and
they
could
have
do
it
again
also
dick
fuld
do
suggest
to
him
that
we
change
lehman
into
a
bank
hold
company
and
paulson
say
no
i
guess
there
be
slightly
different
rule
for
goldman
sachs
and
morgan
stanley
than
for
lehman
brother
the
new
york
time
echoed
this
sentiment
when
it
suggest
in
september
that
regulatory
decision
regard
bear
and
aig
be
motivate
by
a
desire
to
help
jpmorgan
chase
and
goldman
sachs
avoid
big
loss
on
their
respective
exposure
dick
fuld
it
seem
have
too
few
friend
despite
the
scorn
heaped
on
paulson
after
lehman
s
failure
dimon
think
that
paulson
have
no
choice
there
be
no
way
that
anyone
in
the
federal
government
be
go
to
go
in
front
of
the
united
state
congress
to
ask
for
an
investment
bank
to
be
bail
out
he
recall
it
just
wasn
t
politically
feasible
so
i
don
t
know
why
anyone
question
him
at
all
on
the
matter
it
would
have
be
far
well
to
have
them
take
it
over
and
have
an
orderly
unwind
but
they
didn
t
have
the
right
to
do
that
dimon
compare
paulson
s
task
in
the
fall
of
to
a
game
of
whack
a
mole
with
crisis
pop
up
left
and
right
it
s
hard
to
make
policy
on
the
run
he
say
i
think
there
have
be
plenty
of
mistake
but
i
think
that
in
general
and
really
i
m
think
of
bernanke
geithner
and
paulson
here
in
general
they
act
quickly
boldly
and
bravely
they
change
their
course
of
action
when
one
wasn
t
work
could
you
and
i
sit
down
and
say
well
a
would
ve
be
well
than
b
and
well
than
c
absolutely
but
you
re
not
up
there
in
the
ring
it
s
pretty
easy
to
say
to
the
guy
hey
don
t
let
him
hit
you
like
that
ever
a
student
of
history
dimon
sent
paulson
a
note
include
a
citation
from
a
speech
theodore
roosevelt
make
in
paris
in
it
be
not
the
critic
who
count
not
the
man
who
point
out
how
the
strong
man
stumble
or
where
the
doer
of
deed
could
have
do
well
the
credit
belongs
to
the
man
who
be
actually
in
the
arena
whose
face
be
mar
by
dust
and
sweat
and
blood
who
strives
valiantly
who
errs
and
come
up
short
again
and
again
because
there
be
no
effort
without
error
or
shortcoming
but
who
know
the
great
enthusiasm
the
great
devotion
who
spends
himself
for
a
worthy
cause
who
at
the
best
know
in
the
end
the
triumph
of
high
achievement
and
who
at
the
bad
if
he
fails
at
least
he
fails
while
dare
greatly
so
that
his
place
shall
never
be

those
cold

the

have
put
together
a
report
project
west
on
a
possible
combination
for
a
management
retreat
in
the
spring
of
we
always
look
at
it
and
we
always
come
up
with
the
same
conclusion
scharf
told
the
new

time
at
the
right
price
this
be
no
at
the

this
could
be
terrible
at
the
end
of
wamu
be
the
six
large
depositary
institution
in
the
country
but
along
with
that
rank
come
a
problem
it
share
with
a
number
of
its
peer
major
exposure
to
the
subprime
market
in
early
wamu
be
set
up
to
report
a
disastrous
quarter
and
realize
it
need
to
raise
some
capital
we
have
do
lot
of
work
on
wamu
and
we
thought
give
all
the
stuff
that
we
be
hearing
that
we
d
get
a
phone
call
from
them
recall
scharf
that
call
come
in
early
march
while
a
group
of
jpmorgan
chase
executive
be
in
deer
valley
utah
at
the
banker
jimmy
lee
s
annual
private
bigwig
retreat
the
auction
rate
security
market
have
be
falter
at
the
time
and
a
number
of
executive
be
prepare
to
sit
down
and
talk
about
the
bank
s
exposure
when
dimon
s
phone
rang
it
be
kerry
killinger
the
ceo
of
wamu
killinger
told
dimon
that
his
bank
be
evaluate
capital
raise
option
and
have
decide
it
might
also
scope
out
possible
merger
partner
be
dimon
interested
yes
we
be
he
told
killinger
he
then
hand
the
rein
to
charlie
scharf
and
mike
cavanagh
the
next
week
jpmorgan
chase
executive
sat
down
at
the
office
of
law
firm
simpson
thacher
bartlett
to
view
a
brief
presentation
by
wamu
s
management
talk
continued
thereafter
and
soon
plan
be
make
for
scharf
the
chief
financial
officer
mike
cavanagh
the
chief
administrative
officer
frank
bisignano
and
the
head
of
strategy
jay
mandelbaum
to
head
out
to
seattle
for
far
discussion
on
sunday
march
when
the
bear
stearns
deal
come
out
of
nowhere
that
team
shrank
to
just
scharf
and
mandelbaum
as
cavanagh
and
bisignano
be
tie
up
scharf
eventually
decide
he
be
ready
to
start
negotiate
a
transaction
that
would
be
part
cash
part
stock
and
he
inform
the
office
of
thrift
supervision
ots
which
oversaw
wamu
about
the
possibility
of
a
deal
it
soon
become
obvious
however
that
the
wamu
executive
be
not
negotiate
in
good
faith
in
addition
to
deny
scharf
s
team
access
to
important
financial
data
they
also
force
a
ridiculous
daisy
chain
of
call
between
the
two
bank
and
the
ots
in
which
killinger
s
team
played
nice
with
the
regulator
and
then
do
the
opposite
with
jpmorgan
chase
it
s
always
like
that
though
say
the
commercial
bank
chief
todd
maclin
whoever
you
re
try
to
buy
anybody
on
the
other
side
be
go
to
withhold
as
much
information
and
try
to
hide
the
ball
and
you
can
either
decide
to
play
or
not
part
of
the
problem
it
seem
be
steve
rotella
the
president
of
wamu
who
have
run
the
mortgage
business
at
chase
home
finance
before
the
bank
one
deal
neither
dimon
nor
scharf
have
ever
thought
much
of
rotella
s
talent
and
when
he
decamped
for
wamu
in
december
they
hadn
t
be
sorry
to
see
him
go
moreover
rotella
be
not
interested
in
work
for
scharf
or
dimon
again
and
he
told
scharf
so
over
dinner
in
march
no
one
here
want
to
do
this
with
you
guy
he
say
if
we
can
get
some
private
equity
money
and
get
through
this
turmoil
that
s
what
we
want
to
do
we
think
we
deserve
another
bat
at
the
plate
another
stumble
block
be
that
kerry
killinger
the
firm
s
ceo
would
be
out
of
a
job
if
he
sell
to
jpmorgan
chase
and
he
clearly
didn
t
want
to
be
out
of
a
job
although
dimon
have
left
the
investment
bank
quite
alone
when
he
arrive
at
jpmorgan
chase
he
and
scharf
have
thoroughly
revamped
the
primary
mortgage
business
nearly
the
entire
management
team
left
the
firm
some
voluntarily
and
some
not
rotella
have
be
shove
out
when
dimon
be
try
to
create
an
end
to
end
mortgage
assembly
line
from
origination
to
securitization
he
and
several
of
his
colleague
go
to
washington
mutual
and
here
be
dimon
and
scharf
knock
on
their
door
it
be
no
wonder
they
be
receive
poorly
wamu
ultimately
spurn
a
billion
offer
roughly
per
share
from
jpmorgan
chase
in
early
april
in
favor
of
a
capital
infusion
from
a
consortium
of
private
equity
firm
most
notably
texas
pacific
group
which
put
in
billion
there
s
also
the
issue
of
regulator
own
self
interest
the
weak
portion
of
a
patchwork
quilt
of
regulation
ots
have
see
two
of
the
big
thrift
crater
in
the
past
year
countrywide
and
indymac
and
if
wamu
go
away
as
well
there
might
be
no
more
need
at
all
for
the
government
branch
what
regulator
would
regulate
itself
out
of
existence
the
jpmorgan
chase
team
take
defeat
in
stride
there
be
a
chance
that
this
bank
be
go
to
come
back
to
us
dimon
told
his
executive
committee
dimon
and
his
team
saw
the
quality
of
jpmorgan
chase
s
own
loan
portfolio
begin
to
deteriorate
and
they
figure
wamu
might
eventually
face
up
to
billion
in
loss
little
do
they
know
that
the
firm
would
fail
just

them
know
to
keep
their

their

because
the
opportunity
to
buy
wamu
out

happen
sooner
than
they
thought
the
fact
that
it
come
back
around
in
that
amount
of

be
kind
of
shock
recall
the
chief
financial
officer
mike
cavanagh
he
be
right
in
the
sense
that
five
month
be
not
a
long
time
but
those
five
month
from
april
to
september

we

go

have
to

option
come
back
to
jpmorgan
chase
hat
in
hand
it
be
met
with
a
stiff
arm
reminiscent
of
the
one
it
have
give
scharf
in
april
we
get
the
call
that
say
ok
now
we
re
ready
recall
scharf
we
told
them
we
would
go
through
the
process
but
we
be
also
very
clear
with
them
we
say
don
t
count
on
us
to
buy
the
company
we
ve
be
through
this
before
executive
once
again
sat
down
with
their
wamu
counterpart
and
found
to
their
surprise
that
the
wamu
team
thought
there
be
still
some
equity
value
in
the
company
they
believe
their
rosy
number
recall
mike
cavanagh
so
at
a
point
we
say
this
be
not
productive
we
ll
do
the
data
room
stuff
and
all
that
but
we
have
no
interest
in
buying
the
whole
company
on
monday
september
just
a
week
after
the
failure
of
lehman
brother
executive
met
with
regulator
at
jpmorgan
chase
s
headquarters
to
talk
about
the
process
even
though
it
seem
increasingly
unlikely
that
wamu
could
sell
the
entire
firm
the
regulator
decide
to
run
a
dual
track
process
and
told
jpmorgan
chase
they
be
advise
potential
bidder
to
consider
different
option
from
buying
everything
to
buying
just
the
deposit
and
mortgage
portfolio
neither
sheila
bair
nor
tim
geithner
be
at
the
meeting
and
this
meant
by
implication
that
dimon
didn
t
need
to
be
there
either
but
he
be
and
he
stayed
almost
the
entire
time
rodgin
cohen
of
simpson
thacher
there
on
behalf
of
wamu
recall
the
significance
of
dimon
s
presence
this
be
not
a
meeting
he
need
to
attend
cohen
say
and
at
the
end
of
the
day
money
talk
but
the
fact
that
he
be
there
clearly
make
an
impression
on
the
regulator
but
what
make
even
more
of
an
impression
be
how
conversant
he
be
in
the
detail
he
be
all
over
it
the

team
decide

left
them
with
a
range
of

and
all
that
be
left
be
to
put
a
final
number
on
the

note
that
the
number
be
lucky
in
both

slaphappy
from

the

agree
that

explain
be
for

there
be
an

no

the

encapsulate

strategy
dimon
have
pursue

much
of

not
only
have
he
go
out
of
his
way
to
make
himself
accessible
to
reporter
he
spent
an
inordinate
amount
of
time
focus
on
his
regulator
and
their
concern
some
people
have
wonder
what
the
point
of
all
the
outreach
be
what
do
it
have
to
do
with
generate
sustainable
earnings
growth
be
it
just
ego
gratification
but
the
deal
with
bear
stearns
and
wamu
show
the
value
of
a
high
profile
and
a
carefully
cultivate
image
as
a
man
and
a
company
of
caution
i
once
heard
someone
respond
to
the
question
of
how
one
can
be
successful
by
say
you
have
to
be
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
say
analyst
mike
mayo
who
move
to
calyon
security
in
march
when
ask
how
to
do
that
the
response
be
you
have
to
be
in
a
lot
of
place
a
lot
of
the
time
those
two
deal
be
where
jamie
s
image
and
that
of
jpmorgan
chase
translate
into
actual
transaction
this
be
now
the
go
to
bank
when
regulator
pick
up
the
phone
it
would
not
surprise
me
in
this
environment
if
jamie
dimon
get
the
first
call
in
the
next
unusual
situation
we
might
find
ourselves
in
by
refuse
to
step
up
and
buy
the
whole
company
dimon
essentially
wipe
out
wamu
s
common
shareholder
include
the
private

firm
texas
pacific

tpg
which
get
smoke
for

on
its

investment
tpg
have
somehow
manage
to
unload
million
of
its
exposure
in
the
interim
dimon
also
let
the
bondholder
get
wipe
out
and
he
end
up
buying
something
estimate
to
be
worth
billion
or
so
for
just
billion
jpmorgan
chase
s
stock
rise
percent
the
next
day
even
though
the

steve

who
have
indicate
in

that
he
do
not
want
to
work
for

dimon
again
be
grant
his
wish
and
be
told
he
would
be
terminate
jpmorgan
chase
make
all
the
decision
about
senior
management
within
five
day
of
the
deal
a
decisive
move
that
help
stop
deposit
outflow
in
their
track
there
be
no
nicety
toss
into
the

the
bankruptcy
be
not

and
no
executive
be
paid
a
change
in

provision
a
marked
departure
from
the
generous
retention
payment
make
to
bear
stearns
executive
in
april
on
december
jpmorgan
chase
announce
it
be
lay
off
wamu
employee
about
percent
of
the
total
in
february
it
laid
off
more
as
a
result
of
continued
decline
in
the
value
of
wamu
s
mortgage
portfolio
despite
call
wamu
a
perfect
fit
dimon
nevertheless
acknowledge
that
he
be
double
down
on
the
american
consumer
at
a
volatile
time
the
company
s
bank
branch
mortgage
and
credit
card
business
would
thereafter
account
for
nearly
half
of
jpmorgan
chase
s
overall
profit
that
s
the
big
risk
he
say
but
he
add
that
scharf
and
the
rest
of
the
team
have
do
their
homework
they
knew
wamu
s
asset
cold
by
state
and
by
product
and
have
run
the
number
on
bad
case
scenario
for
housing
price
i
m
make
a
bet
that
we
won
t
have
a
depression
in
this
country
he
say
if
we
do
have
one
the
deal
will
have
be
a
mistake
but
that
s
our
job
to
make
those
determination
and
figure
out
what
we
think
be
right
it
s
just
like
buying
a
new
house
you
may
be
wrong
with
your
timing
and
the
price
may
go
down
but
what
be
you
go
to
do
spend
your
whole
life
worry
about
be
wrong
the
price
have
a
huge
margin
for
error
in
it
but
that
doesn
t
mean
we
won
t
be
wrong
i
don
t
know
what
s
go
to
happen
to
this
economy
at
a
more
granular
level
dimon
s
logic
be
as
follow
even
if
the
company
be
to
be
face
in
with
a
billion
charge
due
to
wamu
s
mortgage
portfolio
the
acquire
asset
would
still
be
earn
billion
a
year
see
in
that
light
the
company
might
end
up
get
nothing
out
of
the
deal
in
the
first
four
or
five
year
but
in
the
fifth
year
it
would
start
pull
down
about
billion
in
earnings
in
that
case
it
will
still
have
be
a
good
deal
he
say
but
there
s
no
doubt
it
s
very
scary
in
the
meantime
people
underestimate
how
scary
that
one
decision
be
it
be
such
a
scary
decision
in
fact
that
jpmorgan
chase
be
the
only
bank
that
end
up
bidding
on
wamu
well
fargo
didn
t
show
up
citigroup
didn
t
show
up
neither
do
wachovia
it
that
light
the
billion
bid
be
arguably
a
little
high
dimon
have
no
regret
sure
it
might
have
be
nice
to
spend
only
a
million
dollar
on
the
thing
but
we
didn
t
spend
a
lot
of
time
wonder
what
the
cover
bid
need
to
be
we
just
figure
out
the
most
we
d
be
willing
to
spend
and
that
turn
out
to
be
about
billion
he
say
it
would
have
be
lucky
to
have
lowball
yes
but
i
d
rather
have
the
company
when
sandler
o
neill
s
analyst
jeff
harte
ask
dimon
whether
he
knew
how
much
well
jpmorgan
chase
s
bid
have
be
than
that
of
the
runner
up
dimon
have
reply
we
don
t
know
and
we
don
t
care
cavanagh
be
a
little
more
forthright
on
the
issue
the
fdic
do
a
good
job

he

jpmorgan

say
that
sure
you
be
do
just
fine
on

you
need
that
extra

just
in

the
sheer
size
of
some
of
the
mistake
make
by
the
jpmorgan
chase
team
just
before
the
credit
bubble
burst
bring
to
mind
a
linger
criticism
of
jamie
dimon
a
number
of
people
close
to
him
wonder
whether
he
overcompensates
for
sandy
weill
s
penchant
for
eventually
trash
his
closest
aide
weill
threw
important
people
in
his
organization
overboard
all
the
time
or
more
precisely
have
someone
else
do
it
for
him
but
jamie
say
a
longtime
colleague
just
can
t
do
it
it
s
a
flat
spot
for
him
i
don
t
think
it
s
because
he
doesn
t
know
it
s
because
he
doesn
t
ever
want
it
say
of
him
that
he
s
just
like
sandy
that
he
ll
just
get
rid
of
people
after
have
be
at
the
ready
to
act
as
weill
s
enforcer
in
the
early
day
in
other
word
dimon
be
in
need
of
an
enforcer
of
his
own
by
jamie
dimon
learn
from
sandy
weill
that
although
play
people
off
against
each
other
might
actually
work
to
your
own
advantage
what
it
also
do
be
create
a
dysfunctional
environment
that
can
destroy
a
company
he
often
talk
of
mature
company
the
like
of
wal
mart
and
johnson
johnson
and
how
it
be
no
surprise
that
a
lack
of
corporate
intrigue
tends
to
go
hand
in
hand
with
long
term
success
it
could
be
say
that
while
many
of
his
competitor
be
lose
their
focus
dimon
be
run
his
business
just
like
wal
mart
itself
give
the
giant
retailer
s
razor
thin
margin
its
obsessive
focus
on
cost
on
counting
everything
that
can
be
count
have
help
it
outrun
competitor
for
year
dimon
s
philosophy
be
similar
still
instead
of
hold
his
most
senior
executive
responsible
for
poor
decision
some
say
dimon
often
go
to
the
other
extreme
take
personal
responsibility
for
mistake
on
some
level
that
s
a
noble
and
mature
approach
on
another
it
avoids
address
specific
mistake
make
by
specific
people
the
hardest
work
man
in
banking
need
to
admit
that
it
s
not
always
about
him
that
sometimes
other
people
s
mistake
be
just
that
their
mistake
and
not
his
own
there
be
a
lot
of
people
around
here
that
feel
that
if
he
s
close
to
somebody
they
get
more
license
than
they
should
on
both
performance
and
behavior
say
one
member
of
the
firm
s
operating
committee
grant
there
be
an
alternative
argument
that
j
p
morgan
have
manage
to
outperform
most
of
its
rival
precisely
because
of
the
stability
in
its
management
rank
and
when
dimon
speaks
fondly
of
his
team
he
mean
it
he
relies
extensively
on
the
input
and
insight
of
top
management
and
rarely
do
thing
that
he
think
will
be
a
good
idea
all
by
himself
he
actually
trust
the
people
work
for
him
and
trust
too
that
they
can
learn
from
their
mistake
as
he
have
learn
from
his
own
wall
street
be
a
pressure
cooker
and
when
the
pressure
start
to
get
intense
in
the
more
insecure
of
its
chief
executive
start
fire
everybody
around
them
to
make
sure
outsider
knew
where
they
should
place
the
blame
such
a
strategy
do
enhance
one
s
short
term
job
security
but
the
problem
with
it
be
that
when
turnover
get
too
high
no
one
really
know
what
s
go
on
anymore

so
he
be
demonstrate
a
combination
of
business
skill
and
public
relation
savvy
that
be
the
require
complement
of
someone
look
to
run
a
giant
global
company

whenever
the
subject
of
a
possible
second
career
for
dimon
in
politics
come
up
the
medium
be
practically
demand
it
in
the
fall
of
those
who
know
him
best
cite
a
number
of
automatic
disqualifiers
the
first
be
his
mouth
while
he
no
longer
us
the
f
word
quite
as
much
as
he
do
when
he
be
young
it
s
still
prominent
in
his
vocabulary
the
second
be
his
congenital
inability
to
suffer
fool
gladly
those
close
to
him
have
notice
a
mellow
with
age
but
his
temper
still
flare
up
all
you
have
to
do
be
offend
his
sense
of
fairness
when
the
new
york
time
s
columnist
joe
nocera
obtain
a
pas
code
call
into
an
employee
only
jpmorgan
chase
conference
call
and
assert
in
a
subsequent
article
that
the
company
plan
to
use
the
federal
government
s
billion
capital
injection
to
buy
weaken
competitor
dimon
be
irate
first
i
don
t
think
it
s
right
to
sneak
onto
an
internal
phone
call
like
that
he
say
second
we
hadn
t
even
receive
the
tarp
money
yet
third
the
person
he
quote
wasn
t
even
in
a
position
to
know
what
we
be
go
to
do
with
the
money
and
fourth
that
employee
even
say
something
that
essentially
contradict
nocera
s
point
he
say
we
be
go
to
try
to
grow
our
business
wouldn
t
that
be
lending
because
that
s
what
business
we
re
in
the
lending
business
jpmorgan
chase
complain
to
the
time
about
nocera
s
sneakiness
dimon
also
insist
that
the
bank
be
increase
lending
at
least
certain
kind
of
lending
the
second
advertisement
in
the
company
s
series
the
way
forward
which
ran
on
november
say
our
business
be
lending
and
that
s
exactly
what
we
re
do
by
late
fall
jpmorgan
chase
have
billion
in
the
interbank
loan
market
increase
its
commercial
loan
balance
by
percent
through
the
year
s
end
and
also
increase
both
student
loan
and
credit
card
loan
he
also
repeat
whenever
give
the
chance
that
in
the
era
after
world
war
ii
bank
have
account
for
percent
of
lending
in
the
economy
but
by
the
turn
of
the
twenty
first
century
that
portion
have
fall
to
just
percent
the
rest
be
provide
by
wall
street
and
the
so
call
shadow
banking
industry
which
include
hedge
fund
money
market
fund
and
creator
of
securitized
debt
the
seize
up
of
credit
that
cripple
the
global
economy
in
and
in
other
word
could
not
be
explain
simply
by
say
that
a
bunch
of
bank
decide
to
stop
lending
accord
to
a
study
by
the
consultancy
oliver
wyman
bank
lending
decrease
by
billion
from
to
while
capital
market
lending
fell
by
billion
give
that
total
net
bank
lending
in
be
just
billion
the
study
observes
it
be
obvious
that
bank
would
never
be
able
to
make
up
for
the
shortfall
from
capital
market
in
order
to
understand
and
learn
from
the
crisis
dimon
argue
it
be
important
to
examine
all
facet
of
what
be
now
a
gigantic
and
complex
organism
of
credit
what
s
more
he
continued
if
it
be
lax
lending
standard
that
cause
the
crisis
how
could
he
now
be
criticize
for
tighten
them
it
s
a
total
misconception
that
bank
aren
t
lending
he
say
they
be
and
in
huge
number
where
the
bottom
fell
out
be
in
the
shadow
lending
system
where
lending
almost
disappear
that
say
credit
standard
at
bank
have
tighten
and
for
good
reason
it
be
loose
lending
standard
that
cause
a
lot
of
these
problem
to
begin
with
in
spring
dimon
met
with
president
obama
and
other
banking
chief
and
refer
to
tarp
fund
as
a
scarlet
letter
then
during
a
conference
call
in
april
he
refer
to
it
as
tarp
baby
the
pseudo
inflammatory
nature
of
the
remark
aside
the
public
relation
consideration
surround
tarp
have
indeed
become
complex
dimon
want
to
pay
the
money
back
but
he
be
sensitive
to
the
administration
s
concern
that
in
do
so
he
might
open
up
a
divide
between
the
have
and
the
have
nots
possibly
result
in
a
run
on
bank
less
healthy
than
jpmorgan
chase
which
be
to
say
most
of
them
by
june
though
dimon
get
what
he
want
authorization
to
pay
the
money
back
along
with
eight
other
bank
on
this
point
some
critic
in
the
medium
saw
dimon
as
be
selective
with
the
fact
the
government
support
jpmorgan
chase
in
way
other
than
tarp
dimon
s
bank
be
the
second
large
user
of
a
debt
guarantee
program
sponsor
by
the
fdic
the
company
have
borrow
billion
through
the
program
through
april
benefiting
handsomely
from
reduce
borrowing
cost
provide
by
the
guarantee
dimon
insist
that
this
be
not
as
big
a
deal
as
it
seem
look
it
barely
save
us
money
he
say
and
it
save
a
lot
for
some
other
people
we
maybe
save
a
half
a
percentage
point
in
borrowing
cost
use
the
program
while
some
other
people
save
two
percentage
point
so
it
s
actually
asymmetrically
not
so
good
for
us
in
any
event
when
we
go
to
washington
they
told
us
they
want
us
to
take
the
tarp
money
and
they
want
us
to
use
the
guarantee
so
that
s
what
we
do
when
secretary
of
the
treasury
tim
geithner
introduce
his
ppip
initiative
the
public
private
investment
program
intend
to
help
investor
take
bad
mortgage
off
bank
book
with
government
backing
he
inadvertently
create
a
whole
new
set
of
problem
for
wall
street
ceo
bank
like
jpmorgan
chase
critic
argue
would
now
be
use
tarp
money
to
buy
one
another
s
bad
bet
at
a
discount
with
government
backing
in
april
dimon
and
his
team
have
decide
ppip
be
too
hot
to
handle
i
think
we
will
probably
want
to
stay
as
far
away
from
that
as
possible
dimon
say
we
don
t
need
it
it
might
give
a
little
upside
but
so
what
to
have
our
motif
call
into
question
wouldn
t
be
worth
it
we
don
t
need
the
money
on
his
quarterly
earnings
call
he
repeat
the
sentiment
we
re
certainly
not
go
to
borrow
from
the
federal
government
he
say
because
we
ve
learn
our
lesson
about
that
he
have
since
say
he
go
too
far
with
that
statement
still
while
eminently
capable
of
cooperate
with
government
dimon
be
without
question
a
businessman
in
a
conference
call
in
may
he
question
regulator
tendency
to
pinpoint
certain
issue
without
an
understand
of
the
occasional
futility
of
it
all
say
the
regulator
realize
that
restaurant
be
sell
soda
at
a
percent
margin
he
say
they
ll
get
all
excite
and
make
a
push
to
reduce
that
margin
to
or
percent
i
ll
tell
you
what
the
result
will
be
the
restaurant
will
raise
the
price
of
the
burger
if
he
defies
the
expectation
of
his
friend
and
colleague
and
becomes
a
statesman
in
the
next
incarnation
of
his
career
dimon
will
probably
need
to
work
far
on
his
filter
through
april
he
have
do
an
effective
job
of
balance
endorse
government
official
response
to
the
crisis
while
wait
for
the
day
he
could
shake
them
off
his
back
but
his
patience
be
obviously
wear
thin
and
his
provocative
remark
such
as
the
one
about
the
tarp
baby
have
have
a
two
step
forward
one
and
a
half
step
back
effect
on
his
relationship
with
the
administration
despite
its
general
facelessness
today
wall
street
be
at
one
point
a
place
where
statesman
be
forge
but
the
last
master
of
the
universe
to
merit
such
a
description
be
probably
lazard
s
felix
rohatyn
who
earn
his
own
comparison
to
john
pierpont
morgan
when
he
help
new
york
city
avoid
bankruptcy
in
he
be
also
ambassador
to
france
from
to
since
then
the
result
have
be
more
mixed
the
goldman
sachs
graduate
bob
rubin
and
hank
paulson
fail
to
rise
beyond
the
level
of
technocrat
could
dimon
revive
the
tradition
perhaps
but
as
a
lifelong
banker
he
do
hold
certain
viewpoint
that
could
easily
undermine
a
political
career
testify
in
front
of
the
house
financial
service
committee
in
february
he
insist
that
the
compensation
paid
to
senior
executive
at
jpmorgan
chase
be
appropriate
that
be
just
a
few
week
after
he
have
award
million
in
stock
grant
to
the
company
s
top
executive
include
more
than
million
apiece
to
steve
black
bill
winter
and
jes
staley
dimon
take
none
although
the
associate
press
calculate
his
compensation
as
million
base
on
a
million
salary
stock
award
from
previous
year
and
perk
there
s
a
lot
of
political
and
social
pressure
to
change
compensation
just
like
there
be
a
lot
of
economic
competitive
pressure
that
drove
it
up
dimon
say
so
i
think
there
will
be
change
there
be
legitimate
complaint
about
compensation
that
be
not
properly
paid
to
people
who
do
terrible
job
in
hindsight
and
sometimes
it
wasn
t
even
in
hindsight
but
i
also
think
talent
will
always
be
well
paid
and
i
don
t
think
it
s
fair
to
lump
us
all
together
we
don
t
have
supplemental
executive
retirement
plan
we
don
t
have
k
match
for
high
paid
executive
we
ve
gotten
rid
of
all
the
change
of
control
contract
and
golden
parachute
here
i
do
think
that
if
you
re
captain
of
the
ship
you
should
pay
the
price
first
but
i
m
also
philosophically
oppose
to
the
government
be
involve
in
compensation
i
think
it
s
ridiculous
why
don
t
they
regulate
actor
and
sport
star
and
small
business
and
doctor
and
entrepreneur
why
don
t
they
just
tell
everyone
what
we
can
pay
people
by
the
end
of
call
to
nationalize
the
country
s
large
bank
be
in
vogue
especially
among
influential
commentator
like
paul
krugman
of
the
new
york
time
although
it
seem
obvious
that
some
bank
be
insolvent
the
stock
market
knock
citigroup
share
down
to
a
share
at
one
point
dimon
make
sure
to
put
space
between
his
bank
and
the
others
jpmorgan
chase
will
be
fine
if
everyone
stop
talk
about
damn
nationalization
of
bank
he
say
we
ve
get
plenty
of

naive
about
how
the

be
played
in

when
it
come
to

a
fact
that
be
not
surprising
give
citigroup
s
much
great
need
for

support
he
also
make
no
secret
of
his
support
for
obama
during
the
presidential
race
he
be
an
informal
adviser
to
the
candidate
in
the
lead
up
to
the

and
his

through
her
work
in
the
chicago
school
system
at
one
point
dimon
refer
to
the
acquisition
of
bear
stearns
as
a
mission
not
accomplish
an
unsubtle
dig
at
then
president
george
bush
and
his
premature
declaration
of
victory
in
iraq
after
obama
s
victory
the
medium
and
the
blogosphere
be
awash
in
conjecture
as
to
whether
dimon
be
on
obama
s
short
list
of
candidate
for
secretary
of
the
treasury
although
the
rumor
take
on
a
life
of
its
own
and
resurface
in
early
when
secretary
of
the
treasury
tim
geithner
come
under
ceaseless
fire
nothing
come
of
it
dimon
didn
t
expect
a
call
and
wouldn
t
have
take
the
job
if
he
d
gotten
one
there
s
no
way
a
wall
street
ceo
would
have
be
name
secretary
of
the
treasury
he
say
in
december
after
obama
tapped
geithner
for
the
job
with
all
the
anger
at
wall
street
people
understandably
want
someone
that
they
feel
be
independent
of
specific
influence
when
ask
why
he
didn
t
quash
the
rumor
dimon
look
perplexed
it
s
kind
of
presumptuous
to
announce
you
re
not
interested
in
something
that
you
haven
t
be
offer
isn
t
it
when
obama
become
president
he
single
out
dimon
for
praise
there
be
a
lot
of
bank
that
be
actually
pretty
well
manage
j
p
morgan
be
a
good
example
i
don
t
think
jamie
should
be
punish
for
do
a
pretty
good
job
manage
an
enormous
portfolio
at
the
company
s
investor
day
in
february
dimon
respond
president
obama
give
j
p
morgan
a
shout
out
recently
he
say
so
i
want
to
give
him
one
too
i
think
he
s
do
a
pretty
good
job
obama
do
it
again
at
the
end
of
april
when
he
commend
jpmorgan
chase
for
make
sacrifice
on
the
term
of
its
debt
in
the
chrysler
bailout
it
s
clear
to
me
that
obama
be
quite
bright
say
dimon
and
quite
knowledgeable
when
you
see
him
privately
and
publicly
it
s
the
same
thing
it
s
not
like
there
be
two
obamas
he
s
very
knowledgeable
about
the
stuff
he
talk
about
he
s
clearly
ethical
hardworking
and
strong
there
be
many
different
kind
of
strength
he
be
strong
to
go
through
the
election
he
be
strong
to
state
his
opinion
even
though
a
lot
of
people
hate
them
he
be
strong
to
shoot
drone
missile
in
pakistan
he
doesn
t
have
a
tremendous
amount
of
real
world
experience
but
i
think
he
get
stuff
he
seem
to
understand
thing
and
he
s
pretty
much
do
what
he
say
he
be
go
to
do
whether
you
like
it
or
not
dimon
and
his
wife
be
guest
at
the
inaugural

of

and
implore
frank

to
stop
vilify

to
score
political
point
to
go
out
with
the

to
watch
two
ball
of
hyperenergy
collide
say
their
friend
peter
maglathlin
whenever
we
get
together
with
them
the
decibel
level
seem
to
rise
it
s
pretty
funny
you
know
you
re
go
to
have
an
interest
even
of
back
and
forth
the
esteem
in
which
obama
hold
dimon

reveal
by

about

with

check
for

the

this
be
an
antic
you
wouldn

lewis
who
be
strip
of
his
chairman

in

while
humorous
the
move
also
have
a
cutthroat
undertone
the
basic
challenge
of
be
a
bank
during
a
recession
aside
jamie
dimon
have
far
less
to
worry
about
than
most
of
his
competitor
that
be
make
even
clearer
during
a
conference
call
on
may
during
a
discussion
of
the
impend
result
of
the
bank
stress
test
dimon
predict
that
the
government
might
still
look
to
jpmorgan
chase
to
do
something
in
case
another
firm
teeter
on
the
edge
but
even
obama
isn
t
safe
from
the
occasional
shot
across
the
bow
from
dimon
in
march
dimon
lambast
the
presidential
candidate
for
their
anticorporate
populism
i
m
a
democrat
he
say
the
democrat
be
the
bad
in
his
speech
at
the
chamber
of
commerce
a
year
later
dimon
return
to
the
issue
of
demonize
company
say
that
the
country
be
act
like
a
dysfunctional
family
although
it
be
surely
appreciate
by
the
audience
the
comment
elicit
scorn
from
commentator
who
mocked
dimon
for
seemingly
feel
sorry
for
himself
and
other
ceo
dimon
s
retort
painting
everyone
with
the
same
brush
be
counterproductive
especially
if
you
re
accuse
someone
of
break
the
law
i
don
t
believe
the
corporate
world
be
any
more
corrupt
than
anywhere
else
he
say
there
be
bum
everywhere

it
have
be
say
of
the
great
credit
bubble
and
crash
that
the
trouble
start
when
a
number
of
wall
street
firm
sell
share
to
the
public
when
that
happen
the
argument
go
wall
street
chieftain
their
banker
and
their
trader
be
effectively
gamble
with
other
people
s
money
with
skewed
incentive
system
that
favor
near
term
result
who
wouldn
t
put
up
the
farm
on
even
the
riskiest
of
bet
few
people
it
turn
out
jamie
dimon
have
never
subscribed
to
that
way
of
think
while
he
s
not
averse
to
pay
himself
an
extraordinary
amount
of
money
he
have
also
do
well
by
his
shareholder
jamie
have
be
a
very
responsible
steward
of
shareholder
capital
say
the
banking
analyst
meredith
whitney
that
s
the
best
thing
anyone
can
say
about
a
ceo
that
s
all
that
matter
this
by
the
way
be
one
of
the
only
nice
thing
whitney
say
about
the
entire
banking
industry
between
and
he
certainly
have
be
a
responsible
steward
of
his
own
capital
dimon
s
stake
in
jpmorgan
chase
share
option
and
restrict
stock
be
worth
about
million
and
that
s
only
about
half
his
net
worth
so
the
family
be
worth
a
hefty
million
or
so
still
his
stewardship
would
be
test
in
as
significant
exposure
to
cash
strap
american
consumer
and
business
meant
that
the
company
be
due
for
several
more
quarter
of
multibillion
dollar
loss
and
write
down
we
re
as
beaten
down
as
anyone
else
in
this
environment
say
the
chief
financial
officer
mike
cavanagh
in
late
the
culture
around
here
be
not
one
of
congratulation
and
puff
ourselves
up
it
s
tear
it
apart
at
all
time
and
there
s
certainly
plenty
to
tear
apart
now
jamie
dimon
cannot
understand
how
anyone
could
approach
a
business
differently
for
any
of
our
business
you
can
get
a
reporting
packet
and
it
will
tell
you
everything
that
s
go
on
include
what
s
good
and
what
s
bad
he
say
what
we
aim
for
be
continuous
improvement
it
s
not
like
we
think
we
get
to
a
perfect
place
dimon
show
the
courage
of
his
conviction
once
again
by
cut
the
company
s
dividend
on
february
a
move
he
explain
be
vital
to
preserve
jpmorgan
chase
s
capital
i
m
a
large
investor
in
j
p
morgan
say
brian
rogers
who
be
the
ceo
of
t
rowe
price
and
be
a
classmate
of
dimon
s
at
harvard
i
be
meeting
with
one
of
our
client
that
same
day
and
talk
about
risk
in
the
financial
sector
i
told
them
that
one
of
the
few
thing
you
could
be
confident
in
be
the
integrity
of
j
p
morgan
s
dividend
when
i
return
to
my
office
at
and
found
out
the
news
i
thought
i
be
go
to
kill
him
when
i
listen
to
his
explanation
though
i
thought
you
know
jamie
be
probably
right
i
go
from
a
near
apoplectic
fit
to
say
that
he
be
probably
do
the
right
thing
for
the
company
everyone
obviously
agree
as
his
stock
be
up
in
the
aftermarket
in
may
when
the
result
of
the
government
s
stress
test
on
the
country
s
large
bank
be
release
dimon
and
jpmorgan
chase
be
right
where
everyone
expect
them
to
be
head
and
shoulder
above
the
majority
of
their
peer
bank
of
america
be
say
to
need
a
stagger
billion
in
new
capital
but
dimon
s
fortress
balance
sheet
be
consider
adequate
as
it
be
at
that
point
there
be
no
more
debate
that
any
far
consolidation
in
the
industry
be
likely
to
be
lead
by
jpmorgan
chase
the
predator
be
again
on
the
prowl
still
although
dimon
be
receive
the
best
press
and
command
the
most
respect
of
his
entire
career
the
cheer
be
somewhat
mute
by
the
country
s
anger
with
the
entire
financial
system
and
its
recklessness
the
billion
in
bailout
fund
be
paid
by
taxpayer
be
one
thing
to
also
owe
the
bank
a
mount
credit
card
bill
and
a
mortgage
worth
more
than
one
s
house
quite
another
at
one
point
the
only
thing
hinder
jamie
dimon
s
progress
be
sandy
weill
by
he
be
swim
against
the
tide
of
an
entire
industry
of
overreach
ceo
epilogue
for
the
first
half
of
his
career
jamie
dimon
be
a
character
in
someone
else
s
story
sandy
weill
s
but
by
it
be
clear
that
dimon
s
star
have
eclipse
weill
s
and
it
be
also
clear
that
weill
have
make
a
terrible
mistake
year
before
when
he
fire
dimon
when
ask
about
it
in
his
office
in
december
weill
confess
as
much
i
think
i
make
a
very
bad
decision
on
succession
he
say
today
he
have
only
the
high
compliment
for
his
onetime
prot
g
jamie
obviously
have
far
few
blind
spot
than
most
people
in
this
business
he
s
outperform
most
of
them
the
two
deal
dimon
pull
off
in
show
that
he
could
follow
in
sandy
weill
s
footstep
as
an
acquisition
specialist
but
there
be
one
main
difference
unlike
weill
jamie
dimon
wasn
t
pursue
opportunity
he
be
take
advantage
of
them
the
u
s
government
have
practically
insist
that
dimon
take
over
bear
stearns
the
last
time
the
government
have
talk
to
weill
about
acquisition
in
it
be
to
say
that
his
company
citigroup
should
lay
off
for
a
while
as
his
serial
deal
make
have
left
citi
daze
and
confuse
jamie
have
outgrown
the
comparison
with
sandy
weill
say
the
analyst
mike
mayo
as
we
look
back
sandy
weill
apparently
cut
more
corner
than
people
appreciate
but
jamie
go
out
of
his
way
to
ensure
that
the
foundation
and
plumbing
be
strong
what
weill
be
likely
to
find
quite
difficult
to
believe
be
a
share
opinion
of
many
who
work
with
both
men
over
the
year
that
dimon
contribute
more
to
their
success
together
than
weill
by
this
point
he
would
probably
consider
jamie
his
peer
but
sandy
s
not
in
the
same
league
as
jamie
say
one
not
anymore

there
be
a
number
of
people
who
rise
to
the
top
rank
of
wall
street
unnoticed
by
most
of
us
the
hedge
fund
kingpin
james
simon
come
to
mind
at
least
until
he
start
pull
down
more
than
billion
a
year
even
governor
jon
corzine
of
new
jersey
usually
stayed
under
the
radar
during
his
climb
to
the
top
of
goldman
sachs
jamie
dimon
be
not
one
of
those
people
we
saw
him
come
a
mile
away
yet
it
wasn
t
until
that
a
complete
picture
of
dimon
emerge
after
year
of
be
consider
a
glorify
number
cruncher
who
only
knew
how
to
cut
cost
he
be
finally
acknowledge
as
a
leader
who
knew
how
to
make
a
company
grow
what
s
more
he
be
recognize
as
both
a
creative
thinker
and
a
man
with
the
ability
to
shape
the
culture
not
just
of
his
company
but
also
of
his
industry
and
even
the
country
itself
it
say
something
about
wall
street
today
that
only
a
few
people
command
both
the
respect
of
their
peer
and
the
genuine
curiosity
of
the
outside
world
jamie
dimon
be
certainly
one
of
them
although
from
an
early
age
he
prefer
wealth
to
the
intellectual
pursuit
of
his
brother
dimon
evolve
into
a
financial
philosopher
in
the
spirit
of
warren
buffett
dimon
s
letter
to
his
shareholder
be
a
tour
de
force
a
clarion
call
for
change
from
the
ceo
of
one
of
the
large
bank
in
the
country
he
start
work
on
the
letter
several
month
in
advance
and
spent
many
weekend
refining
his
message
i
don
t
write
a
lot
he
say
so
it
s
very
hard
for
me
in
addition
to
explain
jpmorgan
chase
s
result
the
letter
also
tackle
a
big
question
what
have
just
happen
that
be
as
much
for
me
as
for
the
shareholder
he
recall
it
be
cathartic
i
d
give
some
talk
about
what
have
happen
and
what
should
be
do
about
it
but
i
d
never
really
organize
those
thought
that
s
what
i
set
out
to
do
the
letter
be
especially
forceful
on
the
effect
of
excessive
leverage
the
industry
s
tendency
toward
use
short
term
financing
to
support
long
term
asset
and
regulatory
failure
in
particular
that
of
the
housing
finance
concern
freddie
mac
and
fannie
mae
most
impressive
of
all
may
have
be
the
understated
eloquence
of
his
prose
simple
and
direct
just
like
buffett
s
the
letter
actually
prompt
buffett
to
send
dimon
yet
another
admire
note
jamie
it
read
you
have
outdone
yourself
your
letter
be
a
masterpiece
buffett
go
on
to
ask
dimon
s
permission
to
distribute
the
letter
at
his
own
annual
meeting
he
also
sent
copy
of
the
letter
to
his
friend
bill
gate
as
well
as
his
colleague
charlie
munger
it
s
the
best
i
ve
see
anywhere
he
say
both
gate
and
munger
agree
nearly
year
after
the
young
harvard
graduate
sat
in
the
seagram
building
and
marvel
at
the
legendary
buffett
s
own
letter
the
legend
be
marvel
right
back
at
him
jamie
dimon
have
always
be
a
winner
by
he
be
something
else
entirely
he
be
a
hero
in
april
at
a
reunion
of
his
high
school
at
which
he
be
give
the
alumnus
achievement
award
he
comment
on
what
he
consider
the
surrealness
of
it
all
refer
to
the
school
s
late
headmaster
charles
cook
dimon
say
i
bet
he
d
be
pretty
surprised
to
see
me
up
here
right
now
one
of
the
reason
jamie
dimon
come
out
of
look
so
good
be
that
just
as
jpmorgan
chase
be
outperform
its
competitor
dimon
be
outperform
his
ceo
peer
in
his
public
response
to
the
crisis
and
the
orgy
of
recrimination
it
have
engender
guilt
be
normally
in
short
supply
on
wall
street
but
it
be
shock
just
how
few
mea
culpas
be
heard
from
banker
who
have
amass
great
personal
wealth
over
nearly
a
decade
of
illusory
growth
instead
wall
street
kingpin
come
across
as
complainer
of
the
high
order
blame
their
problem
on
everything
but
themselves
a
year
storm
short
seller
panicky
investor
bad
accounting
rule
while
jimmy
cayne
and
dick
fuld
rag
about
the
unfairness
of
it
all
dimon
make
no
excuse
and
blame
nobody
but
himself
although
he
have
technically
work
for
only
four
company
in
his
career
american
express
citigroup
bank
one
and
jpmorgan
chase
dimon
have
long
have
a
reputation
as
a
mr
fix
it
who
know
how
to
instill
discipline
and
clean
up
a
troubled
balance
sheet
in
though
his
job
effectively
become
to
clean
up
the
entire
financial
system
and
in
so
do
he
prove
a
point
he
s
be
focus
on
his
entire
life
that
you
can
still
win
while
do
the
right
thing

the
question
whether
the
mega
bank
model
pioneer
by
weill
and
dimon
be
viable
have
never
be
put
to
rest
that
s
in
part
because
the
two
prime
example
citigroup
and
jpmorgan
chase
have
see
such
starkly
differ
result
at
the
same
time
as
it
become
too
big
to
manage
citigroup
become
too
big
to
fail
critic
say
put
the
entire
financial
system
at
risk
defender
of
the
mega
bank
concept
dimon
include
make
an
argument
similar
to
the
refrain
of
some
people
who
defend
the
second
amendment
gun
don
t
kill
people
people
kill
people
the
model
itself
isn
t
flaw
the
proponent
of
the
mega
bank
say
though
some
of
the
people
try
to
implement
it
be
through
mid
citigroup
have
take
billion
in
new
bailout
monies
as
well
as
obtain
federal
backing
on
a
stagger
billion
of
asset
by
that
time
the
company
be
practically
a
ward
of
the
government
you
couldn
t
design
a
well
footprint
or
get
a
well
set
of
asset
if
you
have
to
build
a
bank
from
scratch
citigroup
s
ceo
vikram
pandit
have
told
business
week
in
april
yet
in
january
pandit
have
begin
to
break
the
company
apart
the
house
that
sandy
weill
built
be
now
a
teardown
meanwhile
dimon
echoed
pandit
s
earlier
sentiment
at
his
own
company
s
analyst
day
in
february
you
can
t
duplicate
this
franchise
he
say
if
i
give
you
billion
you
couldn
t
do
it
in
early
too
the
intellectual
underpinnings
of
the
concept
appear
to
be
validate
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
jpmorgan
chase
s
investment
bank
division
have
falter
but
relatively
strong
result
in
the
other
five
business
unit
have
balance
out
the
loss
then
in
the
first
quarter
of
the
investment
bank
have
a
terrific
quarter
while
the
other
five
unit
saw
their
result
deteriorate
this
be
the
rationale
of
the
model
individual
unit
may
have
volatile
result
but
the
combination
be
more
stable
in
the
end
however
jpmorgan
chase
or
more
precisely
jamie
dimon
might
be
the
exception
that
prof
the
rule
when
something
get
as
big
and
as
complicate
as
jpmorgan
chase
or
citigroup
the
issue
be
not
just
whether
someone
have
the
intellectual
capacity
to
manage
it
someone
must
also
have
the
desire
at
citi
chuck
prince
didn
t
have
the
capacity
and
sandy
weill
didn
t
really
have
the
desire
it
seem
pretty
clear
that
dimon
have
both
but
this
may
be
because
he
be
a
once
in
a
generation
kind
of
person
if
mega
banking
require
a
dozen
jamie
dimons
in
order
to
survive
then
it
be
surely
doom
he
have
an
amaze
sense
of
risk
say
his
former
colleague
at
smith
barney
bob
lessin
currently
vice
chairman
of
investment
bank
jeffries
company
he
understands
it
intuitively
well
than
anyone
alive
so
he
doesn
t
do
stupid
thing
the
industry
have
a
recent
history
of
dramatically
mi
pricing
risk
relative
to
return
jamie
never
fell
for
that
if
you
want
one
phrase
to
describe
him
that
s
it

i
think
he
s
one
of
a
kind
say
dimon
s
college
pal
laurie
maglathlin
there
be
very
few
people
who
can
remain
true
to
themselves
know
when
to
turn
their
job
on
and
off
can
run
a
business
like
the
one
he
do
yet
still
prioritize
with
their
family
his
high
school
friend
jeremy
paul
say
almost
exactly
the
same
thing
there
be
few
people
i
know
who
have
change
less
throughout
their
life
he
say
with
jamie
that
s
really
interest
because
who
have
more
pressure
on
them
than
he
do
but
he
just
handle
it
the
most
successful
people
on
wall
street
have
tend
to
come
from
one
of
two
camp
the
first
consists
of
people
who
do
well
because
everybody
be
scar
of
them
that
list
include
jimmy
cayne
of
bear
stearns
and
ken
lewis
of
bank
of
america
the
second
group
consists
of
those
whom
most
people
like
but
be
also
scar
of
dimon
be
in
that
category
be
he
irreplaceable
be
he
the
steve
job
of
jpmorgan
chase
at
one
point
he
will
leave
the
company
and
that
might
come
sooner
than
many
people
think
once
the
current
crisis
be
past
it
s
hard
to
see
him
stay
on
for
too
long
at
that
point
he
ll
have
do
it
all
building
merge
save
what
else
could
interest
him
you
can
only
wake
up
on
sunday
and
read
page
executive
management
report
for
so
long
one
thing
he
be
not
go
to
do
be
go
to
another
big
company
but
i
m
not
go
to
play
golf
either
he
say
the
list
of
what
dimon
might
do
next
have
both
obvious
and
not
so
obvious
possibility
he
could
teach
most
likely
in
the
socratic
confines
of
harvard
business
school
he
could
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
invest
his
own
substantial
fortune
in
industry
music
or
sport
for
example
that
excite
him
one
fantasy
accord
to
his
wife
opening
his
own
restaurant
and
turn
himself
into
sam
malone
of
cheer
that
or
maybe
he
might
finally
go
and
climb
mount
kilimanjaro
he
do
say
that
he
put
aside
an
hour
so
every
weekend
to
think
about
succession
although
he
considers
the
talent
development
process
inside
jpmorgan
chase
in
need
of
improvement
he
give
the
company
a
c
grade
on
that
front
he
s
pretty
sure
he
s
get
some
strong
executive
who
could
step
into
the
ceo
position
without
much
difficulty
in
case
he
get
hit
by
a
truck
he
say
he
s
already
identify
to
the
board
three
candidate
who
could
take
over
internal
oddsmakers
give
the
best
chance
to
mike
cavanagh
and
jes
staley
i
m
not
one
of
those
people
who
believe
that
no
one
can
do
the
job
like
i
can
he
say
in
fact
i
think
there
be
several
people
who
could
you
might
try
to
tell
me
that
some
of
them
haven
t
be
test
but
if
the
requirement
to
be
a
ceo
be
to
have
be
a
ceo
then
you
ll
never
have
succession
anywhere
at
some
point
you
have
to
take
a
chance
one
thing
jamie
dimon
learn
from
sandy
weill
by
watch
him
do
just
the
opposite
be
that
you
also
have
to
let
go
if
gradually
remarkably
dimon
be
less
hand
on
with
bear
stearns
than
he
d
ever
be
with
any
of
the
many
deal
he
s
work
on
over
the
year
because
he
trust
his
team
to
do
the
job
as
he
would
have
do
it
himself
i
think
he
s
realize
that
it
s
ok
to
let
people
do
stuff
themselves
because
that
s
how

mandelbaum
dimon
now
go
where
he
s
need
and
give
his
executive
freedom
to
operate
in
the
meantime
in
the
process
he
have
turn
into
what
the
commercial
banking
chief
todd
maclin
refers
to
as
the
best
free
safety
i
ve
ever
met
if
that
truck
doesn
t
hit
him
however
dimon
plan
in
mid
to
stick
around
for
the
time
be
that
political
career
the
one
he
say
he
s
not
sure
he
even
want
will
always
be
wait
for
him
when
he
decides
it
s
time
to
move
on
i
now
bleed

he
say
this
be
what
i
be
go
to
do
until
they
don
t
want
me
here
anymore
it
s
not
as
if
there
isn
t
still
work
to
do
jpmorgan
chase
be
hardly
out
of
the
wood
and
in
the
next
few
year
it
will
bear
as
much
of
the
brunt
of
the
economic
crisis
as
any
bank
what
s
more
a
new
wall
street
be
be
built
today
and
there
be
surely
another
jamie
dimon
in
training
ready
to
take
the
mantle
from
the
man
who
take
not
one
but
two
company
to
the
top
rung
of
the
industry
how
would
he
respond
to
a
call
to
service
if
the
president
of
the
united
state
ask
him
to
be
secretary
of
the
treasury
even
after
watch
hank
paulson
and
tim
geithner
be
criticize
for
almost
every
decision
they
make
in
very
challenge
circumstance
he
would
probably
accept
one
of
his
regret
in
life
be
never
have
serve
his
country
in
an
official
capacity
he
do
believe
that
be
ceo
of
jpmorgan
chase
be
a
form
of
public
service
but
he
also
acknowledges
that
others
might
not
see
it
that
way
especially
consider
the
paycheck
that
come
with
it
patriotism
be
one
of
the
strong
current
that
run
through
him
wall
street
have
always
be
a
venue
for
fly
by
night
conqueror
but
jamie
dimon
have
prove
that
he
be
not
one
of
them
as
a
result
his
legend
will
endure
well
than
most
and
it
will
be
that
of
someone
with
the
unique
skill
experience
and
temperament
to
stand
above
his
peer
at
a
crucial
moment
in
history
some
effective
wall
street
ceo
have
come
with
all
the
analytical
skill
that
allow
them
to
understand
the
business
some
have
come
with
all
the
magnetism
need
to
be
true
leader
few
in
history
have
come
with
both
but
jamie
dimon
do
he
come
in
technicolor
and
stereophonic
sound
say
warren
buffett
he
have
a
broad
outlook
and
he
s
young
so
there
s
go
to
be
action
for
him
for
a
long
time
to
come
the
jamie
dimon
of
be
the
same
jamie
dimon
of
who
charm
his
future
wife
with
his
unvarnished
character
he
hasn
t
retreat
behind
the
usual
veil
of
legalistic
corporatespeak
and
this
just
might
be
the
most
refresh
fact
about
a
man
who
have
so
much
at
stake
and
it
s
impossible
to
deny
that
most
people
who
wander
into
his
orbit
come
away
feel
as
if
they
ve
just
encounter
a
force
of
nature
at
a
time
when
true
wall
street
leader
seem
in
desperately
short
supply
jamie
dimon
have
emerge
as
a
moral
and
managerial
compass
for
both
his
industry
and
the
country
itself
