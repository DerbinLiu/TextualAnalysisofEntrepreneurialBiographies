rely
on
his
good
look
and
charm
to
get
him
through
most
often
he
have
not
even
look
at
the
speech
before
reading
it
in
the

in
an
appearance
before

thing
they
do
be
to

instead
be
when

arrive
on

with

he
laugh
off
the
arguably
freudian
flub
do
i
really
say
that
and
many
in
the
audience
laugh
along
with
him
but

twenty
seven
year

kate
sit
next
to
him
on
the

to
the

in
embarrassment
there
be
no
laughter
on
this
day
from
the
outset
it
be
clear
that
something
be
wrong
as
busch
attempt
to
address
the
effect
of
the
slow
economy
on
the
beer
business
he
slur
word
and
stumble
over
phrase
at
first
some
in
the
audience
thought
he
be
have
trouble
with
the
teleprompter
but
it
soon
seem
that
the
fourth
be
seriously
impaired
and
not
from
overindulge
in
an
a
b
product
or
take
some
mystery
sinus
medicine
no
this
appear
to
be
a
deep
state
of
stone
unmindful
of
the
rise
murmur
and
the
concerned
look
on
the
face
in
the
crowd
he
plow
on
for
several
excruciate
minute
speak
in
a
kind
of
slow
mo
monotone
finally
mercifully
david

intervene
he
lean
in
to
the
microphone
and
say
obviously
august
be

then
take

more
than
any

a
pure
expression
of

him
the

that

later
he
relent
after

they
thought

laughable
the
grain
be
worthless
and
would
have
be
thrown
out
otherwise
they
knew
gussie
would
have
give
the
grain
to
adie
if
he
d
ask
for
it
that
be
the
point
gussie

not
ask
his
permission
but
have
do
it
behind
my
back

bad
about
all
the

loudly
countermand

quietly
undermine
it
when
he
return
there
have
to
be
a
well
more
professional
way
to
manage
the

out
in

august

young
august
but
on
the
third
floor
of
the
administration
building
where
gussie
held
sway
with
his
longtime
right
hand
man
richard
meyer
he
be
call
the
kid
and
it
be
not
a
term
of
affection
they
be
all
gussie
s
boy
up
there
say
denny
long
august
and
dick
meyer
would
get
into
knockdown
drag
out
disagreement
and
the
old
man
would
always
take
dick
s
side
as
a
b
s
executive
vice
president
meyer
be
officially
the
no
ranked
corporate
officer
and
it
gall
him
that
august
didn
t
acknowledge
that
but
deference
and
humility
be
not
in
august
s
toolbox
and
he
make
it
clear
to
the
rest
of
his
father
s
executive
team
that
he
believe
he
be
fully
capable
of
run
the
company
and
intend
to
do
it
at
his
early
opportunity
they
thought
he
be
cold
arrogant
and
abrasive
august
sought
to
counterbalance
gussie
s
boy
by
hire
a
cadre
of
young
executive
who
be
the
antithesis
of
gussie
he
recruit
them
at
some
of
the
best
business
college
in
the
country
harvard
stanford
columbia
university
and
the
wharton
school
at
the
university
of
pennsylvania
fly
into
town
to
interview
recent
or
soon
to
be
graduate
of
the
mba
program
the
wharton
school
prove
particularly
fertile
ground
it
be
there
that
august
heard
a
speech
by
robert
s
weinberg
a
phd
in
economics
who
be
the
director
of
analytical
service
at
ibm
weinberg
s
speech
be
on
corporate
planning
and
it
apparently
knock
august
out
he
come
to
visit
me
in
new
york
and
take
me
out
to
lunch
at
the
most
expensive
restaurant
in
town
weinberg
recall
later
he
say
i
want
to
offer
you
a
job
and
i
told
him
i
wasn
t
interested
he
say
i
m
disappointed
i
want
you
to
think
about
it
weinberg
thought
about
it
for
several
week
and
decide
he
didn
t
want
to
work
for
a
beer
company
in
st
louis
so
he
sent
august
a
letter
ask
for
a
salary
so
high
he
be
sure
it
would
be
turn
down
six
month
later
out
of
the
blue
august
call
and
say
you
have
a
deal
he
make
weinberg
a
b
s
vice
president
of
corporate
planning
at
wharton
august
also
met
a
professor
name
russell
ackoff
who
ran
the
school
s
management
and
behavioral
science
institute
management
science
be
an
area
of
study
that
be
catch
fire
weinberg
say
ackoff
be
a
brilliant
guy
and
a
superb
salesman
and
he
saw
in
august
a
willingness
to
take
chance
and
look
at
complicate
problem
differently
august
saw
in
ackoff
a
father
figure
with
an
intellect
and
education
he
envy
theirs
quickly
become
a
mentor
prot
g
relationship
august
be
particularly
take
with
ackoff
s
concept
of
preactive
corporate
management
unlike
inactive
management
which
ignore
change
in
favor
of
tradition
and
reactive
management
which
respond
quickly
to
change
when
it
occur
ackoff
s
preactive
management
sought
through
research
and
analysis
to
predict
change
and
prepare
for
it
that
s
exactly
what
august
want
at
anheuser
busch
but
because
ackoff
didn
t
want
to
leave
academia
for
the
beer
business
august
agree
instead
to
endow
his
institute
pay
the
university
to
a
year
for
ackoff
s
student
to
conduct
computer
model
study
of
the
company
s
advertising
marketing
and
distribution
practice
the
various
analysis
have
to
be
do
in
order
for
us
to
know
if
we
be
look
at
something
new
or
be
just
play
the
same
old
game
with
new
name
weinberg
explain
gussie
and
dick
meyer
roll
their
eye
at
the
thought
of
computer
assist
planning
but
they
decide
to
give
august
his
head
as
long
as
his
little
project
didn
t
become
too
expensive
or
disruptive
gussie
have
no
interest
in
what
we
be
do
say
weinberg
i
think
i
kind
of
bamboozle
him
in
the
begin
and
yes
i
think
there
be
an
element
of
indulgence
in
his
attitude
gussie
might
have
be
more
concerned
if
he
d
heard
weinberg
s
presentation
the
philosophy
of
planning
at
the
super
market
institute
in
chicago
six
month
after
he
join
anheuser
busch
traditionally
get
smart
be
an
evolutionary
process
you
have
to
wait
for
one
level
of
management
to
die
and
a
new
level
of
management
to
come
in
but
now
there
be
a
mean
for
change
quickly
one
of
the
planning
department
s
first
major
project
be
an
analysis
of
a
b
s
production
capacity
versus
the
demand
for
its
product
the
result
be
a
model
that
call
for
the
construction
of
new
plant
strategically
locate
to
minimize
freight
cost
gussie
have
be
the
first
american
brewer
to
build
a
plant
outside
his
company
s
home
city
but
after
boldly
launch
operation
in
newark
los
angeles
and
tampa
in
the
s
he
d
grown
cautious
a
new
plant
be
now
a
million
proposition
he
worried
about
move
too
fast
commit
too
many
resource
the
previous
plant
have
be
finance
largely
out
of
revenue
he
didn
t
want
to
incur
a
big
debt
to
the
bank
his
father
and
grandfather
always
try
to
avoid
that
but
with
both
dick
meyer
and
the
board
uncharacteristically
support
the
planning
department
s
model
he
reluctantly
agree
to
build
three
new
plant
in
houston
columbus
ohio
and
jacksonville
florida
of
course
once
he
d
sign
on
to
the
plan
you
would
have
thought
it
be
his
idea
in
the
first
place
at
the
groundbreaking
ceremony
for
the
columbus
plant
he
hopped
on
a
plow
pull
by
a
team
of
eight
clydesdale
and
actually
broke
the
first

for
even
more
expansion
in

during
a
state
of
the
company
presentation
to
a
gathering
of
financial
analyst
at
chase
park
plaza
he
predict
that
anheuser
busch
would
sell
million
barrel
that
year
but
the
company
suffer
from
an
efficiency
problem
due
to
its
production
capacity
it
still
could
not
produce
enough
beer
to
meet
demand
his
propose
solution
be
to
build
more
plant
begin
with
one
in
merrimack
new
hampshire
and
another
in
williamsburg
virginia
again
gussie
go
along
two
week
later
on

be
shut
down
by
a

it
begin
as
a
local
action
in
houston
where
peaceful
picket
have
be
go
on
for
four
week
while
management
negotiate
with
the
union
over
a
number
of
issue
include
the
length
of
a
new
contract
a
b
be
seek
a
three
year
agreement
similar
to
the
one
the
teamster
have
sign
with
the
schlitz
plant
in
longview
texas
but
the
union
would
agree
to
only
one
year
august
have
be
act
as
a
b
s
point
man
in
the
negotiation
with
the
approval
of
his
father
and
dick
meyer
as
a
former
member
of
the
teamster
affiliate
brewer
and
maltster
local
no
in

he
believe
his

give
up
too
much
to
the
union
over
the
year
in
exchange
for
labor
peace
so
he
be
determine
to
take
a
tougher
stand
this
time
and
maybe
show
everyone
there
be
a
new
sheriff
in
town
unbeknownst
to
him
however
gussie
be
play
good
cop
behind
his
back
indicate
to
local

that
he
thought
his

needlessly
hard

gussie
just
want
everyone
to
love
him
say
denny
long
everything
august
be
ask
for
be
correct
it
be
what
we
need
to
grow
and
gussie
knew
that
and
back
it
the
houston
strike
go
national
when
the
company
in
the
person
of
august
sought
to
have
nonunion

cross
the
picket
line
to
make
yeast
brew
prior
to
a
settlement
argue
that
it
be
necessary
because
yeast
culture
have
to
be
make
several
week
in
advance
if
the
plant
be
to
go
into

immediately
after
a

the

and
power
department
put
thousand
of
barrel
of
already
produce
beer
at
risk
of
spoilage
then
in
a
calculate
show
of
strength
the
union
dispatch
picket
overnight
to
every
anheuser
busch
plant
more
than
mass
at

he
lack
basic
human
understand
in
a
statement
to
reporter
lewis
accuse
august
of
institute
a
policy
of
worker
harassment
and
abuse
at
the
houston
and
jacksonville
plant
that
have
force
the

after
they

there
have
be
a
complete
change
of
policy
and
attitude
on
the
part
of
the
company
and
unless
young

activity
be
curbed
there
will
be
nothing
left
of
this
great
company
he
be
directly
responsible
for
the
condition
that
lead
to
this

lewis
even
claimed
that

i
don
t

to
give
you
a
lecture
gussie
say
but
as
president
of
this
club
i
have
a
right
to
speak
to
you
as
men
frankly
and
straight
from
the
shoulder
he
then
deliver
what
sound
a
lot
like
a
lecture
pointedly
mention
that
the
team
s
payroll
be
the
big
in
the
entire
history
of
baseball
he
take
the
player
to
task
for
be
greedy
rude
spoil
and
ungrateful
i
don
t
mind
negotiation
that
s
how
we
get
together
but
ultimatum
rub
me
the
wrong
way
and
i
think
they
rub
the
fan
the
wrong
way
i
be
not
suggest
that
you
should
not
have
individual
business
manager
or
even
press
agent
that
be
your
privilege
but
too
many
fan
be
say
our
player
think
of
money
more
than
the
game
itself
we
be
told
too
many
player
be
refuse
to
sign
autograph
push
kid
aside
when
they
try
to
take
picture
when
the
medium
people
lose
interest
and
when
kid
don
t
want
your
autograph
then
we
well
begin
to
worry
he
didn
t
lose
his
temper
and
bang
the
table
and
shout
but
in
his
ramble
discourse
he
make
quite
a
few
intemperate
remark
include
one
that
seem
to
minimize
their
role
in
the
organization
it
take
hundred
of
people
work
every
day
to
make
it
possible
for
men
to
play
a
game
of
baseball
that
last
for
about
two
hour
this
be
no
pep
talk
he
say
in
closing
i
haven
t
bawl
you
out
but
i
ve
try
to
point
out
that
baseball
be
at
a
serious
point
in
its
history
he
threw
the
meeting
open
to
question
but
none
be
ask
except
by
the
reporter
who
query
the
player
about
their
reaction
to
the
bos
s
comment
as
the
bos
look
on
this
be
just
another
example
of
the
first
class
way
this
club
operates
gush
second
baseman
dal
maxville
i
bet
there
s
not
another
club
where
the
president
and
vice
president
would
take
so
much
time
to
talk
to
player
let
them
know
in
the
best
possible
way

the

team
captain
curt
flood
s
response
be
less
complimentary
it
be
something
that
help
clear
the
air
he
say
then
in
a
subtle
dig
at
gussie
he
add
that
he
agree
it
be
important
not
to
lose
sight
of
who
really
pay
your
salary
and
your
pension
namely
the
fan
privately
flood
be
seethe
he
believe
most
of
gussie
s
comment
be
aim
directly
at
him
the
result
of
their
testy
off

him
down

out
for
which
he

his
costly
error
in
the

gussie
ultimately
give
in
on
the
ninety
grand
but
held
on
to
a
grudge
over
flood
s
comment
which
he
consider
disrespectful
after
all
he
reason
he
have
champion
the
young

from
the
moment

in
him
even
when
his
manager
and
coach
didn

insist
that
they
place
him
in
the

the

he
d
do
that
for

know
it
but
shortly
after
he
join
the

have
receive
a

about
him
from

in
his
complaint
to
the

refer
to

as
a
fresh
nigger
for
even
think
it
be
a
possibility
gussie
and
meyer
ignore
garagnani
s
bigotry
and
focus
instead
on

s
reaction
to
the
incident
the
young

have
not

a
word
about
it
neither

dealt
his

a

rebuke
when
abc

say
to
him
in

what

those
aren
t
exactly
slave
wage
flood
s
response
remains
one
of
the
most
memorable
quote
in
the
annals
of
both
baseball
and
american
labor
a
well

nonetheless
a
slave
there
be
no
record
of
gussie
s
reaction
to
what
must
have
seem
to
him
an
unforgivable
slur
but
there
s
anecdotal
evidence
to
suggest
that
the
travail
of
take
a
toll
on
him
emotionally
at
belleau
farm
that
fall
sixteen

he
have
tear
in

later
he
say
he
d
have
a

and
he
didn
t
know
what
be
go
to
happen
something
have
occur
that
make
him
question
whether
he
should
stay
on
as

of
the

or
retire
adolphus
get
up
and
talk
to
gussie
for
a
while
but
his
father
could
not
articulate
what
happen
in
the
dream
that
have
shaken
him
so
it
be
a
shock
to
me
because
dad
be
always
tough
and
sure
of
himself
adolphus

quote
as

i
could
cut

cost
by
percent
but
where
quality
be
concerned
the
subject
be
verboten
even
forbes
which
have
celebrate
gussie
in
the
past
take
a
swipe
at
him
depict
him
as
slow
down
and
out
of
touch
with
modernity
in
an
article
that
end
on
a
smugly
patronize
note
it
be
hard
not
to
sympathize
with
gussie
busch
with
his
pride
in
tradition
and
in
his
product
yet
if
the
job
of
management
be
to
make
money
for
its
stockholder
and
to
assure
the
long
term
health
of
the
company
it
be
fair
to
ask
whether
busch
should
be
pay
more
attention
to
the
dollar
sign
will
gu
busch
s
pride
yield
to
economics
the
answer
be
a
resound
table
pound
no
from
gussie
there
would
be
no
change
to
the
budweiser
brewing
process
as
long
as
he
be
in
charge
and
he
plan
to
be
in
charge
as
long
as
he
be
alive
as
one
a
b
wholesaler
put
it
the
old
man
would
burn
the
brewery
first
of
course
gussie
s
refusal
to
cut
brewing
cost
only
increase
the
pressure
to
cut
elsewhere
he
have
already
order
that
the
company
cease
pay
for
the
helicopter
that
august
use
to
fly
back
and
forth
between
the
brewery
and
waldmeister
every
day
now
he
suggest
at
a
management
committee
meeting
that
all
of
the
top
executive
give
up
their
company
provide
automobile
it
be
not
a
popular
idea
to
begin
with
but
when
gussie
reveal
that
he
wasn
t
include
himself
in
the
car
giveback
dick
meyer
blew
up
you

you
be
go
to
keep
all
your
four
or
five
car
and
your
two
driver
but
as
president
of
this
company
i
be
to
have
no
car
that
s
bullshit
and
with
that
he
get
up
and
walk
out
of
the
meeting
the
car
privilege
continued
but
effort
be
make
to
replace
the
egregious
gas
guzzler
include
the
big
heavy
station
wagon
use
to
ferry
the
busch
child
with
more
fuel
efficient
vehicle
gussie
and
dick
meyer
get
into
it
again
a
few
week
later
when
gussie
demand
that
he
lay
off
more
than
a
hundred
people
in
the
top
and
middle
management
rank
meyer
thought
gussie
be
act
capriciously
and
unreasonably
so
he
refuse
gussie
told
him
to
either
make
the
cut
or
resign
and
meyer
chose
the
latter
to
the
surprise
of
everyone
except
perhaps
gussie
and
august
some
executive
believe
that
gussie
use
the
layoff
as
a
pretext
to
get
meyer
to
quit

thereby
make

finally
take
over

fully
support
gussie

billy

of
the
scene
he
encounter
christina
be
in
the
icu
and
mom
told
me
they
have
all
these

out
of
her
and
she
couldn
t

on
her
own
they
told
me
that
andrew
be
go
to
be
okay
but
that
nathan
be
dead
which
really
upset
me
because
i
be
very
close
to
him
but
i
thought
christina
would
get
well
because
dad
would
make
it
all
right
he
would
get
the
best
doctor
and
they
would
fix
her
the
most
shock
thing
to
billy
be
the
effect
of
the
tragedy
on
his
father
who
be
collapse
in
a
chair
sob
uncontrollably
unable
to
take
charge
of
anything
i
have
never
see
dad
like
that
he
say
it
be
like
everything

be
take

him
gussie
have
dot
on
tina
his
eleventh
child
born
when
he
be
sixty
seven
blond
and
blue
eyed
like
her
mother
she
be
the
last
of
the
mohican
he
like
to
say
he
call
her
his
little
honeybee
and
allow
her
to
climb
up
on
his
lap
at
the
dinner
table
and
take
out
his
false
teeth
and
run
away
with
them
he
always
dance
with
her
at

party
and
the
sight
of
the
two
of
them
the

of
the

clan
delight

one
another

to
stop

now
they
both
be
broken
beyond
fix
the
doctor
told
us
that
if
they
turn
off
the
ventilator
then
christina
probably
would
not
survive
and
if
she
do
she
would
be
a
vegetable
anyway
recall
adolphus
iv
but
mom
and
dad
kept
her
on
it
for
eleven
day
to
explore
any
possible
scenario
they
be
look
for
some
expert
somewhere
who
might
say
there
s
a
chance
here
there
be
no
chance
however
on
december
the
ventilator
finally
be
turn
off
and
the
baby
of
the

would
never

i
understood
why
dad
felt
so
bad
say
billy
but
i
thought
he
would
come
back
instead
from
what
have
be
an
incredibly
happy
family
where
everything
go
so
wonderfully

gussie
cry
nearly
nonstop
and
nurse
his
grief
with
copious
amount
of
alcohol
which
only
deepen
his
depression
and
far
unnerved
his
child
trudy
found
comfort
in
the
catholic
church
the
priest
from
our
lady
of
providence
and
the
nun
at
st

at
the
big
house
the
cottage
and
the
bauernhof
pass
in
sad
silence
broken
only
by
the
sound
of
gussie
s
sob
what
kept
mom
go
be
her
belief
that
christina
be
now
an
angel
in
heaven
and
she
would
see
her
again
say
billy
busch
but
dad
didn
t
have
that
belief
i
have
six
other
child
so
i
couldn
t
go
crazy
trudy
say
year
later
i
couldn
t
forsake
them
for
my
grief
i
accepted
in
general
that
sad
and
terrible
thing
be
part
of
life
i
be
able
to
deal
with
it
much
well
than
gussie
he
couldn
t
handle
sadness
he
become
like
a
child
himself
and
he
didn
t
help
her
in
that
regard
say
adolphus
he
be
another
child
for

with
on
the
day
that
he
show
up
at

brewery
gussie
be
unfocused
erratic
and
disruptive
his
thought
wander
in
the
middle
of
conversation
seemingly
nonsensical
statement
popped
out
of
his
mouth
in
a
management
committee
discussion
about
the
need
for
still
more
production
capacity
for

he
say
in
apparent
seriousness
we
don

we
just
need
to
keep
raise
the
price
until

say
adolphus
christina
s

constantly
say
denny
long
august

add
urgency
to

of
the

meant
they
have
to
be
on
the
road
before
to
traverse
the
thirty
mile
to
waldmeister
you
do
not
want
to
be

with
august
or
tire
either
so
they
try

early
on

and
this
be
in
addition
to

at
any
hour
on
a
sunday
or
a
holiday

point
question
about
their
area
of
expertise
that
they
d
well
be
able
to
answer
to
his
satisfaction
as
much
as
they
resent
august
s
dominion
over
their
life
however
they
be
thrill
he
d
chosen
them
to
be
on
the
team
that
would
run
anheuser
busch
after
gussie
either

unthinkable
option

his
father
out
it
would
be
a
drastic
move
to
be
sure
messy
and
emotional
but
he
saw
no
other
way
around
the
impediment
that
gussie
have
become
miller
provide
the
impetus
the
milwaukee

have
double
its
market

and
its
production
capacity
since

it
from

through
a

that

launch
in
the
history
of
the
industry
propel
miller
into
fourth
place
by
the
end
of
the
year
august
didn
t
believe
that
a
light
low
calorie
beer
would
ever
supplant
his
full
body
budweiser
as
america
s
favorite
but
he
saw
miller
s
rapid
growth
as
a
serious
threat
to
a
b
s
industry
dominance
august
understood
that
we
be
at
war
with
them
say
denny
long
gussie
didn
t
so
august
set
out
to
convince
the
board
of
director
that
for
the
good
of
the
company
it
be
time
for
his
father
to
go
he
met
with
them
individually
over
a
period
of
month
and
found
them
surprisingly
receptive
to
the
idea
even
gussie
s
closest
friend
on
the
board
acknowledge
that
they
be
concerned
about
his
mental
acuity
and
the
challenge
from
miller
august
chose
the
may
board
meeting
to
make
his
official
pitch
to
the
director
gussie
be
alert
to
the
impend
vote
the
night
before
and
trudy
be
ask
to
accompany
him
to
the
brewery
where
august
have
a
doctor
stand
by
in
case
the
old
man
go
into
cardiac
arrest
august
enter
the
boardroom
on
the
third
floor
arm
with
a
detailed
presentation
and
sign
statement
from
all
the
member
of
the
dawn
patrol
say
that
they
would
resign
if
he
be
not
name
ceo
he
be
fairly
certain
he
have
the
vote
but
still
he
worried
that
some
of
the
director
might
lose
their
nerve
in
a
face
to
face
confrontation
with
gussie
who
doubtless
go
into
the
room
think
that
he
would
prevail
as
he
always
have
this
time
however
the
board
do
not
bend
to
gussie
s
will
one
by
one
director
who
have
rubber
stamp
his
every
whim
for
year
go
against
him
and
vote
him
out
as
chief
executive
as
expect
gussie
flew
into
such
a
purple
vein
bulge
rage
that
some
people
present
wonder
if
his
head
might
explode
wait
in
gussie
s
office
trudy
heard
him
shout
over
the
commotion
as
he
storm
down
the
hallway
after
the
meeting
have
end
i
thought
you

beside
himself
scream
trudy
recall
august

directly
into
denny
long
s
office
and

he
quickly
call
a
meeting
of
all
executive
on
the
management
committee
there
s
be
a
change
he
told
them
the
board
have
put
me
in
charge
because
the
chief
have
decide
to
retire
he
always
call
gussie
chief
most
people
assume
it
be
out
of
respect
but
long
suspect
he
be
uncomfortable
with
the
more
intimate
dad
the
official
story
be
of
course
a
lie
gussie
hadn
t
decide
anything
the
term

and
the
board
have
present
to
him
be
nonnegotiable
and
give
his
fifty
year
of
service
brutal
he
could
retain
the
title
of
chairman
but
it
would
be
purely
honorary
he
would
no
longer
have
any
say
in
run
the
company
nor
would
he
be
entitle
to
the
free
use
of

automobile
boat
or
the

the
company
have
lease
everything
but
the
big
house
and
the
cottage
as
an
inducement
for
him
to
go
quietly
they
say
he
could
stay
on
as
president
of
the
cardinal
but
only
if
he
accepted
the
term
and
state
publicly
that
he
be
step
down
voluntarily
he
have
twenty
four
hour
to

before
the

take
off

gussie
arrive
back
at
the
big
house
that

holler
for
all
the

gun
room
trudy

aside
august
have
thrown
out
your
father
she
say
dad
be
not
in
charge
of
the
company
anymore
adolphus
be
astound
what
it
be
not
something
he
ever
imagine
could
happen
i
told
you
trudy
say
i
always
thought
that
little
sonofabitch
would
do
something
like
this
a
sneak
attack
it
s
the
way
he
be
as
gussie
explain
to
the
six
kid
what
their
half
brother
have
do
his
mood
cycle
from
disbelief
and
despair
one
moment
to
vengeful
resolve
the
next
how
could
my
own
son
do
this
to
me
that
no
good
goddamn
bastard
i
ll
get
him
for
this
we
be
go
to
fight
this
thing
by
we
he
meant
all
of
them
he
make
it
clear
that
everyone
in
the
family
be
go
to
have
to
choose
they
stood
either
with
him
or
with
august
and
if
they
side
with
august
then
they
be
dead
to
him
and
disinherit
too
adolphus
s
mind
reel
he
be
about
to
graduate
from
college
and
would
be
the
first
of
the
american
busch
family
to
do
so
his
plan
be
to
work
at
the
brewery
start
at
the
bottom
and
hopefully
climb
the
management
ladder
to
one
day
succeed
august
who
be
seventeen
year
his
senior
gussie
have
always
encourage
him
in
this
regard
and
be
himself
proof
that
the
second
born
son
could
become
king
adolphus
have
just
fill
out
a
pro
forma
job
application
at
the
brewery
but
a
routine
entrance
physical
indicate
he
have
a
hernia
that
need
to
be
correct
through
surgery
before
he
could
start
the
surgery
be
two
week
away
adolphus
knew
he
could
never
go
against
his
father
the
two
have
become
increasingly
close
in
the
last
few
year
but
he
also
knew
that
if
he
side
against
august
and
august
prevail
then
he
probably
would
never
get
to
work
for
the
company
august
would
see
to
that
there
be
no
way
any
of
us
could
avoid
take
a
side
he
say
you
couldn
t
be
neutral
dad
wouldn
t
allow
it
you
have
to
declare
to
gussie
s
deep
disappointment
three
of
his
daughter
by
his
previous
marriage
lotsie
elizabeth
and
to
a
lesser
degree
lilly
support
august
daddy
really
need
to
retire
he
be
exhaust
say
lotsie
the
board
probably
do
what
it
have
to
do
even
though
it
could
have
be
do
well
gussie
quickly
press
adolphus
peter
billy
and
andrew
into
service
the
four
of
you
boy
have
to
have
a
talk
with
your
brother
he
told
them
he
owes
the
family
an
explanation
feel
a
mix
of
anger
sadness
and
disbelief
adolphus
put
in
the
call
to
august
and
arrange
a
meeting
at
the
fence
that
separate
waldmeister
from
belleau
farm
there
be
so
much
animosity
right
then
that
it
couldn
t
have
happen
in
either
house
he
say
later
august
brought
along
his

with
that

be
exactly
what
gussie
would
have
do
for
fifteen
minute
august

passionately
but
without

to
be
do
for
the
good
of
the
company
the
family
and
their
father
throughout
the
confrontation
august
iv
hung
back
about
fifty
yard
as
if
afraid
to
get
too
close
august
turn
to
him
several
time
say
come
on
up
here
son
i
want
you
to
hear
this
but
the
boy
stayed
where
he
be
adolphus
didn
t
know
what
the
meeting
be
suppose
to
accomplish
but
he
be
sure
it
settle
nothing
he
walk
away
from
the
fence
feel
the
weight
of
his
father
lean
on
him
for
support
in
a
fight
he
fear
they
d
already
lose
the
shock
of
the
coup
have
the
immediate
effect
of
focus
gussie
now
he
have
an
enemy
his
own
son
and
he
be
not
without
option
or
friend
he
own
about
percent
of
the
company
s
stock
and
through
the
trust
set
up
by
his
father
he
control
another
percent
august
on
the
other
hand
own
only
about
percent
of
the
share
so
it
be
not
far
fetch
for
gussie
to
think
he
might
be
able
to
use
the
imbalance
to
turn
the
table
on
august

of

clifford
agree
with
susman
that
gussie
should
avoid
a
big
public
battle
with
august
but
say
that
through
quiet
negotiation
we
might
be
able
to
get
back
some
of
what
you
have
lose
at
the
same
time
clifford
say
he
thought
gussie
stood
a
good
chance
of
topple
august
if
he
sell
his
share
to
a
potential
buyer
that
susman
have
line
up
rj
reynolds

company
reynolds
be
entice
by
the
prospect
of
buying
into
the
brewing
business
with
a
competitive
advantage
over
its
longtime
rival
philip
morris
which
now
own
miller
so
eager
be
reynolds
in
fact
that
the
company
s
ceo
paul
sticht
flew
to
st
louis
to
meet
with
gussie
at
belleau
farm
offering
him
a
share
at
a
time
when
a
b
stock
be
still
trading
in
the
low
twenty
with
gussie
s
percent
stake
in
hand
and
a
willingness
to
pay
a
substantial
premium
over
the
trading
price
reynolds
would
have
little
trouble
secure
a
control
interest
in
a
b
and
place
its
own
people
on
the
board
that
wouldn
t
put
gussie
back
in
charge
but
it
would
mean
good
bye
to
august
who
would
either
leave
on
his
own
or
be
vote
out
by
the
new
board
while
gussie
be
mull

his
company
car

driver
susman
told
him
that
he

even
be
able
to
arrange
a
deal
to
buy
the
cardinal
from
the
company
gussie
like
that
idea
so
much
that
he
call
a
press
conference
to
talk
about
it
announce
with
adolphus
at
his
side
that
the
somewhat
bewilder
look
twenty
two
year
old
would
be
part
of
the
cardinal
operation
if
a
deal
could
be
reach
adolphus
be
pray
that
no
one
would
ask
him
a
question
for
the
life
of
him
he
couldn
t
figure
out
why
his
father
would
want
to
buy
the
team
he
d
be
listen
to
gussie
complain
for
year
about
how
the
player
association
be
ruin
the
game
and
make
it
impossible
to
turn
a
profit
the
cardinal
have
earn
profit
of
less
than
million
over
the
entire
twenty
two
year
a
b
have
own
the
team
who
would
want
to
own
a
business
like
that
you
d
do
well
put
your
money
in
a
saving
account
neither
of
the
big
deal
come
to
fruition
after
a
b
place
an
to
million
valuation
on
the
baseball
team
gussie
lose
interest
in
be
the
real
owner
and
chose
to
continue
as
its
president
he
would
have
august
look
over
his
shoulder
but
at
least
it
wouldn
t
cost
him
any
money
and
he
could
continue
to
use
the
rail
car
and
motorbus
during
spring
training
and
the
play
season
and
after
week
of
soul
search
he
decide
that
sell
his
share
to
rj
reynolds
would
be
a
betrayal
of
his
father
and
grandfather
i
don
t
think
they
would
ever
go
along
with
something
like
that
he
told
trudy
august
have
dodge
a
bullet
without
even
know
it
the
rj
reynolds
negotiation
would
remain
a
secret
for
more
than
a
decade
though
he
say
nothing
publicly
in
private
gussie
continued
to
rage
against
august
and
the
board
break
off
relation
with
everyone
he
thought
have
not
support
him
include
his
daughter
lotsie
and
elizabeth
i
try
to
tell
him
to
let
it
go
say
trudy
i
say
it
s
time
you
have
everything
you
could
want
you
have
to
deal
with
it
you
have
to
move
on
and
live
but
he
be
lose
his
empire
and
he
couldn
t
accept
it
he
take
out
all
his
frustration
on
the
people
around
him
yell
and
scream
at
everyone

it
taste
funny
ceo
robert

sought
to
blunt
the
impact
of
the
story
say
that
only
case
have
be
pull
after
a
distributor
report
an
off

very
limited
number
of

by
a

company
but
the
company
s
problem
be
far
more
serious
than
that
and
it
all
stem
from
uihlein

in
the
normal

however
schlitz

to
add
an
artificial

to
counter
the

schlitz
brewery

fear
the
fda

on
the

expose
the
company
to
attack
from

they
begin

another
artificial
antihaze
additive
call
chill

which
could
be
filter
out

on
the

brewing
technician
didn
t
realize

order
their

to
keep
the
chill

the
result
be
a
headless

hunt
and

i
guess
you

problem
with

indicate
that

blank

inch
away
peter
also
say
that
the
gun
be
not
cocked
before

discharge
but
the
county
firearm
examiner
could
find
no
reason
why
the
gun
would
have
fire
so
easily
and
test
in
the
police
laboratory
show
that
without

cocked
it
take
eleven
pound
of
pressure
to
pull
the
trigger
all
of
which
argue
against
an
inadvertent
discharge

repeat
the

line
that
any

enhance

itself
august
predict
to

that

the

be

its
bad
performance
in
fifty
year
once
again
gussie
blew
his
stack
but
this
time
he
didn
t
march
into
the
dress
room
with
a
retinue
of
reporter
in
a
publish
letter
that
sound
as
if
it
have
be
dictate
to
his
secretary
margaret
snyder
rather
than
write
by
a
pr
man
he
lit
into
the
entire
cardinal
organization
down
to
the
bat
boy
i
be
get
damn
mad
he
say
there
be
no
way
and
i
repeat
no
way
i
be
go
to
tolerate
this
type
of
performance
for
the
most
loyal
fan
in
the
world
and
i
mean
this
i
want
this
message
carry
loud
and
clear
the
big
eagle
the
bos
gussie
whatever
they
want
to
call
me
be
not
happy
i
be
tire
of
excuse
management
do
not
pay
salary
to
supposedly
quality
player
for
constant
mental
error
i
personally
have
not
see
too
many
head
first
slide
the
opposition
s
second
baseman
be
kick
into
left
field
on
double
play
and
people
banging
into
wall
to
make
play
my
patience
be
get
thin
i
do
not
recommend
the
purchase
of
the
cardinal
to
the
anheuser
busch
board
so
that
year
later
the
cardinal
would
have
the
bad
record
in
their
history
i
trust
that
i
have
make
myself
clear
and
for
everyone
s
sake
i
be
pray
for
the
situation
to
improve
it
do
but
only
slightly
the
cardinal
finish
second
to
last
ahead
of
the
mets
it
be
a
sign
of
the
change
time
that
st
louis
sportswriter
do
not
unanimously
praise
gussie
for
his
tirade
globe
democrat
columnist
rich
koster
call
it
a
cheap
shot
and
offer
up
a
little
sport
relativism
for
the
man
who
believe
that
second
place
wasn
t
worth
shit
the
cardinal
value
be
not
that
they
win
or
lose
it
s
that
they
be
here
to
enjoy
he
write
and
while
their
owner
be
no
in
beer
his
position
in
the
community
be
perhaps
misuse
by
make
failure
out
of
mere
defeat
during
gussie
s
appearance
at
the
office
he
apparently
didn
t
hear
the
heresy
that
be
be
bandy
about
namely
that
budweiser
the
brand
his
grandfather
have
introduce
to
the
world
year
before
the
cornerstone
of
the
anheuser
busch
empire
the
lifeblood
of
the
busch
heir
and
the
guide
principle
of
his
life
be
finish
budweiser
sale
be
flat
and
the
future
belong
to
new
brand
like
natural
light
and
michelob
light
the
young
generation
have
no
affinity
for
the
beer
of
their
father
and
grandfather
the
old
warhorse
be
on
its
last
leg
at
least
that
s
what
denny
long
be
be
told
by
some
of
his
young
sale
and
marketing
manager
conventional
wisdom
in
the
beer
business
held
that
once
a
brand
start
to
die
there
be
no
revive
it
the
young
executive
believe
that
bud
be
destine
to
go
the
way
of
pabst
blue
ribbon
and
schlitz
and
the
company
should
put
its
money
and
marketing
effort
into
building
new
brand
long
didn
t
buy
it
it
be
true
that
both
of
a
b
s
new
light
beer
have
perform
only
moderately
well
sell
about
million
barrel
each
in
their
first
year
on
the
market
and
that
budweiser
sale
appear
to
be
stall
at
million
barrel
a
year
but
bud
be
still
the
no
sell
beer
in
the
world
and
he
suspect
the
lack
of
growth
be
the
fault
of
the
marketing
or
the
lack
thereof
not
the
beer
the
way
he
saw
it
there
be
only
a
few
brand
name
that
have
become
part
of
the
american
fabric
coca
cola
hershey
levi
s
campbell
soup
and
he
believe
that
budweiser
could
be
one
too
so
when
one
of
his
executive
ask
what
be
we
go
to
do
with
budweiser
he
respond
we
be
go
to
breathe
new
life
into
it
his
idea
be
to
saturate
the
public
consciousness
with
print
ad
and
tv
commercial
aim
at
the
blue
collar
consumer
in

told
the
marketing
team
you
be
not
go
to

it
there
it
s
not
a
place
where
you
be
go
to
spend
your
money
but
budweiser
will
be
in
your
head
and
you
will
have
it
with
you
all
the
time

campaign
in

recently
jimmy

side
with

in
oust
gussie
long
want
a
new
budweiser
campaign
that
would
be
a
salute
to
the
american
worker
he
knew
it
would
be
criticize
as
jumping
on
the
bandwagon
again
because
miller
be
mining
the
blue
collar
vein
but
he
thought
miller
have
the
right
idea
just
the
wrong
beer
as
he
often
say
at
the
employee
meeting
we
be
not
flashy
we
be
seldom
the
darling
of
the
industry
we
just
continue
to
meet
and
overcome
challenge
d
arcy
be
told
that
the
new
campaign
like
its
when
you
say
bud
campaign
need
to
be
comprehensive
meaning
it
have
to
serve
as
the
sole
advertising
message
for
budweiser
over
a
period
of
several
year
not
just
for
a
few
tv
commercial
august
didn
t
get
involve
with
ad
campaign
until
the
agency
and
the
marketing
department
make
their
first
storyboard
presentation
to
him
and
denny
long
he
respond
powerfully
to
this
one
which
propose
to
show
everyday
folk
work
on
the
job
and
then
reward
themselves
with
a
cold
bud
at
the
end
of
the
day
thematically
it
be
derivative
of
the
miller
time
campaign
if
you
ve
get
the
time
we
ve
get
the
beer
but
august
fix
on
one
particular
tagline
from
a
list
of
a
dozen
or
so
suggestion
for
all
you
do
this
bud
s
for
you
he
thought
it
be
perfect
catchy
simple
and
sustainable
from
then
on
he
practically
dictate
the
element
he
want
to
see
in
the
ad
and
commercial
most
importantly
real
people
not
actor
hence
the
first
commercial
be
shot
with
real
factory
worker
on
the
job
in
a
houston
meat
pack

subsequent
shoot

real
construction
worker
truckdrivers
butcher
bartender
and
farmer
per
august
only
twelve
ounce
longneck
bottle
be
show
no
can
even
though
can
be
the
real
work
man
s
preference
he
thought
the
classic
glass
bottle
look
well
and
be
more
in
keep
with
tradition
since
his
great
grandfather
have
establish
budweiser
as
the
king
of
bottle
beer
he
also
believe
that
bottle
provide
the
consumer
with
a
superior
taste
and
tactile
experience
to
help
insure
blue
collar
authenticity
in
the
ad
and
commercial
he
begin
invite
an
ad
hoc
group
of
plant
employee
to
d
arcy
s
presentation
encourage
them
to
comment
on
what
the

be
put
forward
august
s
micromanagement
at
time
rankle
the
d
arcy
creative
team
but
the
collaboration
ultimately
result
in
one
of
the
most
effective
and
memorable
ad
campaign
of
all
time
this
bud
s
for
you
ran
for
more
than
a
decade
and
over

you
by
the
first
of

knew
he
be
in
for
a
rough
few
month
he
may
have
write

but
ultimately
august
be
go
to
decide
the
taste
of
budweiser
light
and
until
august
taste
what
he
like
he
would
make
steinhubl
s
life
difficult
much
of
the

live
in

in
chief
relentlessly
sample
the
output
of
all
nine
plant
and
if
he
taste
something
he
didn
t
like
then
everyone
down
the
line
be
definitely
go
to
hear
about
it
say
one
longtime
senior
executive
each
brewery
have
a
taste
room
where
a
panel
of
five
to
seven
men
from
the

and
malt
operation
sat
at

they
taste
for
the
specific
attribute
of
each
brand
check
for
any
variation
among
the

no
easy
task
ensure
that
million
barrel
a
year
taste
consistent
and
uniform
to
the
consumer
of
course
a
good
taster
could
discern
deviation
that
the
average
beer
drinker
would
never
notice
it
be
say
that
member
of
andy
steinhubl
s
master
taste
panel
which
met
in
room
of
the
old
brew
house
could
sample
a
bottle
of
budweiser
and
identify
which
plant
it
come
from
by
the
characteristic
of
the
water
that
go
into
it
august
be
consider
one
of
the
company
s
best
taster
if
not
the
very
best
he
could
tell
whether
a
beer
be
five
day
old
or
fifteen
there
be
very
few
who
could
taste
like
he
could
say
one
former
executive
he
be
a
genius
at
it
say
denny
long
he
set
our
standard
he
also
enforce
it
plant
manager
outside
st
louis
never
knew
when
he
might
drop
down
out
of
the
sky
in
one
of
the
corporate
jet
but
whenever
he
do
they
knew
there
would
be
a
command
performance
in
their
taste
room
that
day
gathering
as
many
as
twenty
people
he
would
call
for
a
particular
batch
from
the
cooler
say
tuesday
s
budweiser
from
the
newark
brewery
and
they
would
all
take
several
sip
and
make
note
then
he
d
ask
what
they
have
notice
a
wrong
answer
would
be
to
have
miss
something
he
d
write
down
the
taste
go
on
constantly
wherever
august
go
at
the
end
of
a
long
day
on
the
road
meeting
with
wholesaler
he
would
press
one
or
more
associate
into
service
in
the
hotel
bar
announce
with
almost
childlike
enthusiasm
let
s
taste
some
beer
and
the
sip
and
quiz
would
begin
if
he
happen
to
be
in
denver
where
there
be
no
a
b
plant
and
he
felt
the
need
to
taste
that
day
s
budweiser
from
houston
then
sample
would
be
flown
to
him
he
truly
enjoy
the
process
say
mike
brook
a
former
vice
president
of
sale
and
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
he
do
it
with
such
commitment
it
say
to
everyone
in
the
company
that
quality
be
the
most
important
dynamic
of
the
business
because
the
chairman
be
on
it
like
white
on
rice
serve
as
a
rove
one
man
quality

august
incessantly
scan

and
can
for
the
date
code
that
identify
not
only
where
the
beer
have
be
brew
but
also
the
date
and
the
fifteen
minute
interval
during
which
it
have
come
off
the
production
line
because
the
taste
of
beer
deteriorates
over
time
a
b
have
a
strict
policy
that
any
beer
old
than
day
have
to
be
pull
from
distribution
remove
from
retail
shelf
and
destroyed
and
woe
betide
the
local
wholesaler
if
august
ever
come
upon
an
expire
freshness
date
everyone
knew
that
at
any
time
they
could
get
a
phone
call
tell
them
that
august
have
found
a
problem
with
their
beer
and
they
have
to
be
available
to
discus
their
involvement
say
brook
andy
steinhubl

the
call
he

a
saturday

steinhubl
schlepped

allow
his
own
stock
of
beer
to
go
beyond
its
expiration
date
you
must
think
i
m
a
horse
s
as
he
say
to
steinhubl
no
i
don
t
yes
you
do
i
want
you
to
tell
me
i
m
a
horse
s
as
no
i
be
not
go
to
do
that
you
can
t
leave
here
until
you
tell
me
i
m
a
horse
s
as
realize
that
august
probably
would
not
let
him
leave
and
that
this
be
his
awkward
way
of
apologize
for
waste
three
hour
of
his
time
on
a
weekend
steinhubl
give
in
okay
you
re
a
horse
s
as
august
smile
broadly
and
say
good
steinhubl
and
his
brewing
team
set
to
work
create
budweiser
light
in
a
small
pilot
brewery
behind
the
brew
house
they
be
shoot
for
a
crisp
full
body
beer
with
a
flavor
impact
that
built
up
quickly
and
then
finish
clean
meaning
it
would
leave
no
aftertaste
in
its
wake
it
would
be
brew
naturally
and
contain
only
five
ingredient
water
rice
barley
hop
and
yeast
in
other
word
it
would
be
pretty
much
like
budweiser
but
with
few
calorie
and
therein
lay
the
difficulty
to
make
a
low
calorie
beer
it
be
necessary
to
reduce
the
amount
of
sugar
produce
in
the
mash
process
which
in
turn
reduces
the
amount
of
alcohol
produce
in
fermentation
most
beer
drinker
be
unaware
of
the
direct
correlation
between
calorie
and
alcohol
content
steinhubl
expect
that
naturally
brew
budweiser
light
would
have
an
alcohol
content
of
percent
at
best
compare
to
miller
lite
s
percent
which
be
achieve
with
the
help
of
non
natural
chemical
additive
the
disparity
though
slight
could
put
budweiser
light
at
a
competitive
disadvantage
since
less
alcohol
be
hardly
a
sell
point
to
the
college
crowd
because
alcohol
enriches
the
combine
flavor
of
hop
and
barley
less
alcohol
in
the
brewing
process
can
result
in
less
taste
along
with
the
entire
a
b
hierarchy
august
thought
miller
lite
taste
thin
and
watery
so
steinhubl
s
recipe
for
budweiser
light
increase
the
amount
of
hop
in
the
mix
to
give
it
more
flavor
hop
contribute
a
bitter
taste
that
play
against
the
sweet
taste
of
the
barley
malt
the
relative
bitterness
or
hoppiness
of
beer
be
measure
numerically
by
what
be
know
as
international
bitterness
unit
the
high
the
ibu
number
the
more
bitter
the
brew
at
the
time
most
european
beer
have
an
ibu
between
and
budweiser
have
an
ibu
of
for
budweiser
light
steinhubl
bumped
the
ibu
to
which
be
potentially
problematic
because
august
didn
t
like
bitter
in
fact
he
claimed
that
whenever
he
taste
budweiser
that
contain
a
slightly
elevate
level
of
hop
he
experienced
a
throb
sensation
in
his
forehead
that
he
call
head
feel
veteran
of
taste
session
with
august
have
see
head
feel
it
register
on
his
face
as
he
squint
his
eye
furrow
his
brow
and
begin
rub
his
forehead
with
his
forefinger
and
thumb
but
only
one
other
person
denny
long
ever
felt
the
sensation
maybe
it
be
because
he
train
me
to
taste
say
long
who
described
the
feel
as
the
onset
of
a
sinus
headache
right
above
the
eyebrow
still
long
say
he
only
experienced
head
feel
once
or
twice
and
most
of
august
s
fellow
taster
thought
head
feel
be
a
figment
of
his
imagination
they
d
roll
their
eye
and
exchange
look
whenever
he
brought
it
up
and
joke
behind
his
back
yeah
i
ve
have
head
feel
bos
it
s
call
a
hangover
after
a
month
of
tinker
with
the
budweiser
light
recipe
steinhubl
and
his
crew
have
the
first
sample
brew
ready
for
the
taste
panel
the
consensus
in
room
be
that
it
still
need
a
little
tweak
but
they
be
close
overall
pretty
good
say
august
nice
body
smooth
with
a
good
flavor
impact
that
leaf
nothing
hang
in
your
mouth
then
come
the
note
steinhubl
be
expect
but
it
taste
a
little
bitter
what
s
the
ibu
seventeen
steinhubl
admit
how
d
we
get
that
august
ask
we
want
to
give
it
more
flavor
august
didn
t
complain
about
head
feel
and
perhaps
because
no
one
else
say
the
beer
be
too
bitter
he
didn
t
tell
steinhubl
directly
to
reduce
the
hop
but
in
subsequent
week
he
pressure
him
in
other
way
mike
roarty
let
steinhubl
know
that
august
be
voice
misgiving
about
the
ibus
he
doesn
t
like
a
number
that
high
roarty
say
august
sent
sample
to
professor
russell
ackoff
s
group
at
the
wharton
school
and
they
conduct
a
taste
test
at
a
local
tavern
steinhubl
only
learn
of
the
test
when
one
of
ackoff
s
assistant
come
to
st
louis
to
present
their
finding
in
the
conference
room
next
to
august
s
office
the
studious
look
young
man
use
a
chalkboard
to
explain
the
methodology
underlie
the
survey
which
show
that
a
group
of
patron
at
a
bar
in
philadelphia
have
found
the
beer
to
be
too
bitter
irritated
by
what
he
saw
as
a
put
up
job
steinhubl
ask
do
you
taste
the
beer
yourself
no
the
young
man
reply
add
i
never
drink
beer
do
any
of
your
research
group
taste
it
the
young
man
shook
his
head
steinhubl
turn
to
august
in
exasperation
if
we
change
it
then
it
will
not
taste
the
way
you
want
it
to
so
please
let
us
go
ahead
once
again
august
give
no
directive
regard
the
hop
content
but
several
week
later
he
call
steinhubl
to
room
where
he
d
taste
the
beer
for
the
umpteenth
time
i
just
don
t
like
it
he
say
we
re
not
go
to
be
able
to
sell
it
and
the
board
of
director
be
go
to
fire
me
i
ll
be
the
first
person
to
go
steinhubl
didn
t
believe
for
a
minute
that
the
board
would
fire
august
but
he
could
tell
that
the
bos
be
genuinely
worried
after
all
he
be
about
to
put
ten
of
million
of
dollar
and
the
reputation
of
the
company
on
the
line
to
him
budweiser

wasn
t
just
another

off

his
family
s

nothing
with
the
budweiser
name
on
it
have
ever
fail
and
he
sure
as
hell
didn
t
want
it
to
happen
on
his
watch
steinhubl
be
worn
down
from
the
month
of
pressure
august
we
be
all
good
people
try
to
do
our
best
and
we
think
this
beer
be
right
he
say
but
if
you
really
disagree
just
tell
us
what
you
want
us
to
do
and
then
go
away
and
leave
us
alone
i
can
t
do
that
august
say
heavily
as
if
history
itself
would
not
let
him
then
surprised
at
steinhubl
s
uncharacteristic
outburst
he
ask
aren
t
you
afraid
i
be
go
to
fire
you
steinhubl
look
at
him
and
say
no
because
peter
stroh
the
ceo
of

stroh

told
me
they
have
a
job
for
me
anytime

somewhere
in
that
exchange
august
apparently
found
the
reassurance
he
be

believe
in
building
a
team
of
smart
people

he
wonder
if
he

be
hit
by

the
detective
wonder
whether
his
glassy
eye

be
due

the

he

read

take
all
the
while
august

continued
to
answer
question
yes
he
be
related
to
the
busch
beer
family
the
eldest
son
of
the

no
he
didn
t
think
he
d
have
too
much
to
drink
the
night
before
he
d
have
a
few
drink
yes
but
he
have
a
high
tolerance
for
alcohol
because
in
accordance
with
family
tradition
he
d
begin
drinking
beer
at
an
early
age
at
the
same
time
he
suggest
that
perhaps
he
wasn
t
behind
the
wheel
at
the
time
of
the
accident
because
sometimes
when
he
have
too
much
to
drink
he
would
let
a
friend
drive
his
car
as
for

t
even
remember

be
admit
to
the

for
treatment
of
a
possible
skull
fracture
the
injury
make
his
claim
of
amnesia
more
plausible
but
benson
couldn
t
shake
the
suspicion
that
he
be
act
that
maybe
his
apparent
lack
of
emotion
over
the
fate
of
his
passenger
be
due
to
the
fact
that
he
be
just
too
cold
to
care
benson
be
also
unsettled
by
all
of
the
weaponry
in
busch
s
possession
even
in

love
arizona
a
saw
off

be
not
something
you
would
expect
to
find
in
a
college
student
s
apartment
from
the
outset
the
investigator
believe
that
it
be
highly
possible
if
not
probable
that
a
felony
have
be
commit
in
the
death
of
michele

if
august

a
reckless

negligent
manner
under
the
influence
of
drug

both
then
he
could
be
charge
with
involuntary
manslaughter
and
leave
the
scene
of
an
accident
the
blood
and
urine
sample
take
at
the
hospital
would
tell
the
tale
even
though
they
be
take
hour
after
the
accident
any
level
of
alcohol

still
present
in

to
scientifically
estimate
the

the
two
key
piece

the

the
blood

take
from

at
the

the
search
warrant
process
take
more
than
a
week
and
when
benson
finally
sent
a
deputy
to
the

to
pick
up
the
sample
he
get
a
rude

bos
the

back
they
don
t
have
it
the

the

have
be
run
through
a
centrifuge
and
render
useless
for

no
one
on
the

staff
could
explain
how
it
happen
benson
couldn
t
believe
it
never
before
have
the
hospital
mishandle
sample
in
one
of
his
case
it
be
a
potentially
devastate
blow
now
the
prosecution
would
not
be
able
to
prove
scientifically
that
august
iv
be
under
the
influence
at
the
time
of
the
accident
they
d
have
to
build
a
circumstantial
case
rely
on
witness
who
could
testify
that
he
be
impaired
when
he
get
behind
the
wheel
benson
and
his
investigator
conduct
more
than
fifty
interview
with
august
iv
s
friend
and
schoolmate
and
with
employee
and
patron
of
dirtbag
s
and
voila
one
of
august
s
closest
friend
on
campus
told
them
that
august
never
let
anyone
else
drive
his
car
contradict
the
statement
august
give
to
deputy
at
the
hospital
another
student
say
in
witness
statement
that
august
iv
be
a
know
user
of
cocaine
which
could
have
account
for
the
cocaine
residue
the
coroner
found
in
michele
frederick
s
nostril
but
no
one
say
they
have
see
august
use
cocaine
that
night
nor
do
anyone
recall
him
behaving
as
if
he
d
have
too
much
to
drink
it
quickly
become
clear
to
deputy
benson
that
august
iii
s
private
investigator
be
bird
dog
his
every
move
sometimes
arrive
at
the
home
of
witness
just
minute
after
he
have
left
while
investigator
examine
every
inch
of
the
corvette
august
iii
obtain
an
identical
car
and
have
it
transport
to
tucson
where
a
group
of
his
hire
expert
block
off
river
road
at
the
accident
site
and
spent
the
well
part
of
a
day
with
camera
roll
as
a
driver
ran
the
car
through
dead
man
s
curve
at
different
speed
the
idea
be
to
gather
data
that
could
rebut
whatever
the
prosecution
might
present
at
a
trial
they
told
us
what
they
be
do
and
invite
us
to
watch
benson

later
but
when
we
show
up
at
the
time
they
told

benson
who

if

could

would
go

long
way
toward
establish

in

benson
wonder
if
the
tiny
pima
county
prosecutor

office
be
overmatched
evidence
aside
do
they
even

up
against

in
a

he
suspect
they
didn
t
and
the
thought
left
him
feel
unsettled
and
vulnerable
it
be
a
cold
gray
day
with
remnant
of
snow
on
the

as
the
busch
security
man
pull
the
car
into
the
dimly
lit
airport
parking
structure
it
be
like
a
scene
from
a
movie
benson
recall
and
suddenly
it
struck
me
that
i
be
all
by
myself
far
from
home
and
without
backup
from
what
i
have
see
of
their
operation
it
didn
t
seem
all
that
far
fetch
to
think
that
they
could
easily
do
away
with
some
lowly
deputy
sheriff
from
arizona
the
driver
hand
him
his

benson
threw
himself
into
the
investigation
with
renew
zeal
for
four
consecutive
weekend
he
sat
in
his
car
near
the
crash
site
on
river
road
write
down
the
license
plate
number
of
vehicle
that
pass
by
between
a
m
and
a

then
he
trace
the
plate
to
the
more
than
one
hundred
register
owner
and
call
each
one
to
see
if
they
have
driven
by
and
see
anything
the
morning
of
november
he
kept
think
about
mary
jo
kopechne
the
young
woman
who
be
kill
late
one
night
in
when
senator

drove
his

off
a

on
chappaquiddick
island
in

then
left
the

the
next
morning
kennedy
receive
a
two
month
suspend
jail
sentence
for
leave

after
an
inquiry
found
there
be
no
evidence
that
he
have
be
drive
negligently
pima
county
face
a
similar
problem
with
august
iv
even
though
the
blood
and
hair
sample
benson
collect
in
st
louis
turn
out
to
match
what
be
found
on
the
visor
above
the
driver
s
seat
in
the
corvette
it
only
prove
that
august
iv
be
behind
the
wheel
when
the
car
roll
over
not
that
he
be
in
any
way
impaired
there
be
no

no
usable

lift
from
the
empty
bud
light
can
found
by
the

all
that
could
be
prove
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
be
that
august

be
drive
too
fast
to
navigate
a
curve
that
local
law
enforcement
have
know
for
year
be
unduly
dangerous
the
prosecutor
s
office
conclude
it
be
highly
unlikely
that
a
jury
would
return
a
felony
conviction
for
negligent
manslaughter
they
felt
they
stood
a
well
chance
of
a
guilty
verdict
for
leave

at
what
cost
to
the

coffer
the

be
prepared
to
spend
a

which
be
a
major
perquisite
on

he
replace
august

wreck
corvette
with
a

and
secure
a
town
house
apartment
for
him
on

from

nothing

spokesman
if
he
didn
t
think
they

then
he
should

report
them
when
somebody

get

say
the

no

enough
to

there

george

in

august

do
not
call
the

him
the

say
he
intend

fredericksen

two
of

but
he
tore
into

until
three

if
the

they

told
about
it
i
can
t
think
of
anything
that
justifies
it
the

say
the
detective
show
their
badge
sound
their
siren
and
flash
their
red
light
during
the
pursuit
we
believe
what
the
policeman
have
say
happen
peach
say
these
be
honorable
men
the
probable
cause
be
the
high
rate
of
speed
at
which
he
be
operating
his
car
if
the
busches
disagree
that
s
what
we

for
for
all
his
tough
talk
peach
end
up
pull
his
punch
he
drop
the
felony
weapon
charge
say
it
do
not
meet
the
legal
requirement
because
the
gun
be
not
on
his
person
or
within

he

not

it

it

he
assign
his
least
experienced
attorney

a
misdemeanor
attorney
who
have
never

to

fredericksen
the

would
have
prefer
that
peach
drop
the

altogether
but
they
knew
he
couldn
t
come
on
the
heel
of
peter

get
probation
in
the

david
leeker

august

walk
away
scot

in
the

it
would

by
the

as
whitewash
evidence
that
the

routinely
bought
off

action
and

that
undermine
the

a

the

the

august

be
immediately

an

be
quietly
launch
long
be
told
about
the
investigation
but
august
decide
to
keep
it
out
of
his
purview
because
orloff
and
martino
work
for
him
martino
be
consider
long
s
prot
g
the
decision

didn
t
sit
well
with

he
thought
it
create
the
appearance
that
august
didn
t
trust
him
the
next
few
week
be
difficult
as
auditor
brought
in
by

begin
go
through
thousand
of
invoice
from
outside
supplier
long
be
not
kept
post
every
now
and
then
august
would
drop
a
little
bombshell
on
him
tell
him
for
instance
that
a
no

new

rock
band
manage
by
an
old
friend
of
joe
martino
s
have
be
paid
more
than
by
the
company
but
have
perform
no
service
long
be
shock
that
martino
could
have
be
involve
in
something
so
sleazy
it
didn
t
sound
like
the
guy
he
knew
martino
have
grown
up
work
class
poor
in
the
bronx
and
go
on
to
earn
an
mba
from
the

at
age
thirty
four

star
in
the
company
regard
among
his
peer
as
a
street
smart
straight
arrow
which
be
why
august
s
suspicion
about
martino
and
drug
didn
t
ring
true
either
ever
since
his
son
s
trouble
in
tucson
august
have
be
on
a
tear
about
drug
especially
cocaine
which
he
blame
for
all
manner
of
society
s
ill
now
he
be
convince
that
martino
and
maybe
a
few
others
be
involve
in
cocaine
possibly
to
the
point
of
distribute
it
throughout
the
company
do
you
know
that
percent
of
the
employee
in
the

be
on

he
say
to
long
one
day
how
do
you
know
that
long
reply
august
respond
vaguely
that
the
investigator
have
say
that
to
a
b
s
chief
of
security
gary
prindiville
like
august
long
be
an
old
school
beer
guy
who
knew
next
to
nothing
about
drug
but
he
be
fairly
certain
you
couldn
t
come
up
with
a
number
like
that
unless
you
conduct
extensive
test
among
the
plant
employee
which
he
knew
have
not
be
do
he
thought
the
percent
be
a
wild
exaggeration
and
the
idea
that
martino
be
behind
the
distribution
be
completely
out
of
line
of
course
it
didn
t
matter
what
he
thought
what
matter
be
that
august
believe
it
the
conversation
left
him
unsettled
wonder
if
perhaps
august
s
opening
question
do
you
know
that
wasn

entirely
rhetorical
and
what
he
really
meant

how
could
you
have

this
happen

an
inquisition

tear
the

where
the

his
back
this
be
someone
who
be
out
to
get
him
but
why
august
come
back
to
long
s
office
later
that
day
close
the
door
quietly
and

in
a
soft
voice

m
afraid
the
board
of

will
now
accept
your
resignation
i
probably
feel
bad
about
this
than
you

nothing

make
it
clear
to
him
that

nice
thing
about
him
to
the
medium
call
him
my
closest
business
associate
and
friend
for
the
past
year
one
of
the
fine
business
executive
i
know
at
the
same
time
august
have
make
him
the
scapegoat
in
the
scandal
issue
a
statement
say
the
individual
involve
be
under
mr
long
s
direct
supervision
and
he
have
assume
full
responsibility
for
their
action
it
be
a
subtle
twist
of
the
word
in
the
press
release
and
it
wasn
t
true
he
have
not
assume
responsibility
for
whatever
martino
and
orloff
have
do
and
to
say
they
be
under
his
direct
supervision
be
an
exaggeration
that
make
it
sound
as
if
the
scheme
have
be
hatch
right
under
his
nose
neither
man
report
directly
to
him
they
be
among
dozen
of

who
be
technically
under

couldn
t
possibly
have
know
what

do
in
the
field
the

to
make

it
paid
for
long
believe
that
august
have
take
advantage
of
his
loyalty
as
evidence
by
the
fact
that
shortly
after

he
have
forfeit

absolutely
unfit

of
this

the
reference
be

because
in
an

twist
the

have
order

the

the
beneficiary
of
a

trust
to
which
he
resort
when
he

i
doubt
that
he
will
allow
his
daughter
to
stand
in
the
way
of
his
transient
pleasure
although
billy
would
prove
him
wrong
on
that
last
point
the
judge
be
accurately
reflect
the
public
s
perception
of
billy
at
the
time
base
largely
on
an
incident
that
occur
in
when
he
be
twenty
two
follow
an
arm
wrestling
contest
in
the
bar
where
he
later
met
angela
whitson
billy
be
challenged
to
a
fight
by
the
man
he
d
best
and
in
the
course
of
the
subsequent
roll
around
on
the
ground
melee
and
supposedly
at
the
urge
of
the
chant
crowd
he
bit
off
the
top
half
of
his
opponent
s
ear
no
charge
be
file
because
billy
have
not
start
the
fight
and
he
paid
the
man
for
his
injury
but
news
report
of
the
bloody
brawl
become
so
embed
in
the
public
consciousness
that
even
today
after
more
than
two
decade
as
a
model
citizen
and
devote
father
billy
still
be
commonly

from
his

by
the
descriptor
the
one
who
bit
off
the
guy
s
ear
not
surprisingly
press
coverage
of
the
custody
battle
played
up
the
sensational
revelation
and
the
busch
wealth
rather
than
the
story
of
a
young
single
father
try
to
protect
and
provide
for
an
out
of
wedlock
child
it
wasn
t
clear
how
much
gussie
grasped
about
the
late
scandal
swirl
around
his
family
because
his
health
take
a
turn
for
the
bad
around
the
time
of
the
custody
hearing
in
april
and
thereafter
he
be
bedridden
most
of
the
time
it
s
unlikely
he
would
have
judged
billy
in
any
case
of
his
five
son
billy
be
the
one
who
most
resemble
him
physically
and
behaviorally
down
to
his
love
of
grant
s
farm
and
devotion
to
the
animal
particularly
the
elephant
billy
would
in

be
the
last
busch
to
move

gussie
s
relationship
with
august
iii
warm
as
his
time
grow
short
nothing
brighten
his
mood
more
than
the
sound
of
august
s
helicopter
set
down
on
the
front
lawn
of
the
big
house
toward
the
end
august
come
at
least
once
a
week
and
sat
with
gussie
for
an
hour
or
so
always
take
the
time
to
inspect
the
antique
wood
and
marble
beer
box
in
the
pantry
where
the
house
supply
of
budweiser
be
kept
and
if
he
found
a
bottle
past
its
freshness
date
then
you
be
in
trouble
say
a
former
household
staff
member
by
all
account
there
be
now
genuine
affection
between
father
and
son
and
no
trace
of
the
anger
and
resentment
that
have
characterize
their
relationship
for
more
than
three
decade
on
gussie
s
part
the
rapprochement
be
due
as
much
to
forgetfulness
as
forgiveness
he
just
didn
t
remember
the
unpleasant
detail
anymore
and
instead
bask
in
the
glow
of
august
s
constant
praise
all
of
this
happen
because
of
you

none

regard
the

with
an
equal
measure
of
hero

picture
of
the
two
of

in
happy

exactly
why
they
thought

would
help

anyone

sense
that

d
have
dinner
with
his
father
on
sunday
night
and
then
come
in
on
monday
and
say
my
dad
and
i
talk
and
this
be
what
we
be
do
his
father
inadvertently
empower
him
people
knew
he
be
probably
go
to
be
chairman
one
day
so
they
get
out
of
his
way
they
defer
to
him
even
though
his
actual
position
didn
t
dictate
that
deference
inevitably
resentment
sprang
up
between
the
old
member
of
the
management
team
and
the
young
men
the
fourth
be
bring
in
to
the
mix
you
have
the
big
brother
and
the
little
brother
say
one
observer
of
the
dynamic
the
big
brother
be
for
the
most
part
loyal
to
august
iii
and
felt
that
help
the
fourth
succeed
be
part
of
their
duty
to
the
chief
the
little
brother
felt
they
owe
allegiance
solely
to
the
fourth
and
they
saw
his
father
as
a
tyrant
intent
on
hold
on
to
power
for
as
long
as
he
could
it
be
a
repeat
of
the
pattern
establish
thirty
year
earlier
when
a
young
august
iii
and
his
corporate
planner
butt
head
with
gussie
and
his
buddy
up
on
the
third
floor
of
the
old
administration
building
the
big
brother
thought
the
fourth
be
too
caught
up
in
the
glamour
aspect
of
the
business
the
cool
tv
commercial
sport
sponsorship
and
lavish
super
bowl
party
and
didn
t
pay
enough
attention
to
the
sale
function
of
the
brewery
and
its
distributor
the
gritty
work
that
move
the
product
out
of
the
plant
and
into
the
beer
cooler
of
america
they
look
askance
at
the
fourth
s
grow
relationship
with
ron
burkle
a
onetime
california
supermarket
magnate
turn
billionaire
investor
whose
reputation
for
womanize
match
or
exceed
his
own
and
whose
party
at
his
beverly
hill
mansion
green
acre
feature
the
sort
of
guest
the
fourth
would
never
have
bumped
into
at
the
horny
toad
include
former
president
and
mr
clinton
and
the

jesse

and
his

and
jonathan
the

burkle
on
at

one
occasion
at

who
he
be
but
take
to
call
him
the
rich
guy
the

grumble
that
while
the
fourth
be
hobnob
with
burkle
he
avoid
mix
with
people
far
more
important
to
the
company
he
do
not
respect
our
distributor
say
one
he
view
them
as
hire
help
rather
than
the
wealthy
independent
businessmen
that
they
be
he
have
the
attention
span
of
a
flea
say

than
he

and
there
be
some
delay
so
after
about
an
hour
august

how
much
business
do
we
do
with
eleven
say
a
former

four
million

year
and

i
ll
wait
all
night
for
someone
who
buy
that
much
beer
from
us
sometimes
the
fourth
wouldn
t
show
up
for
meeting
at
all
when
his
father
and
all
the

the
vice
president
of

have
his
assistant

in
his
regret
at
the
last
minute
where
s
august
his
father
ask
a
subordinate
at
the
kickoff
cocktail
party
he
be
suppose

in
los
angeles
where
he
remain
for
the
entire
weekend
to
the
big
brother
it
be
another
example
of
his
lack
of
work
ethic
the
little
brother
have
an
entirely
different
view
of
their
bos
they
saw
him
and
by
extension
themselves
as
the
hip
breath
of
fresh
air
the
company
need
to
blow
away
the
smell
of
the
clydesdale
stable
that
seem
to
cling
to
everything
they
point
to
the
success
of
the
bud
light
i
love
you
man
and
real
men
of
genius
campaign
as
evidence
that
the
fourth
be
himself
a
marketing
genius
capable
of
lead
the
company
to
new
height
of
success
if
his
father
would
just
support
him
and
not
keep
undermine
him
all
the
time
the
fourth
foster
the
latter
sentiment
by
post
some
personal
note
his
father
have
sent
him
on
the
wall
in
his
home
where
others
could
see
them
they
be
painful
to
read
stern
and
businesslike
say
a
frequent
visitor
to
his
house
the
most
loyal
of
the
little
brother
sometimes
characterize
the
fourth
as
a
visionary
or
even
a
great
man
but
at
the
same
time
they
ignore
or
cover
up
behavior
that
belie
such
description
they
knew
for
example
that
his
party
be
begin
to
interfere
with
his
job
performance
do
it
ever
make
sense
to
you
why
he
would
never
attend
a
meeting
before
noon
it
be
because
he
d
gotten
wreck
the
night
before
and
he
couldn
t
make
one
before
that
one
of
the
little
brother
confide
to
a
big
brother
year
later
after
the
takeover
deal
go
down
and
how
many
meeting
do
he
cancel
out
on
the
old
married
executive
miss
the
sign
because
they
didn
t
stay
up
with
fourth
into
the
wee
hour
when
his
demeanor
change
and
he
get
a
little
loopy
and
poignant
and
stood
with
his
face
a
little
too
close
as
if
something
more
than
alcohol
be
at
work
the
big
brother
attribute
his
unavailability
to
laziness
the
little
brother
didn
t
tell
them
what
be
really
go
on
for
fear
they
would
tell
dad
the
fourth
s
mother
susie
apparently
knew
enough
to
call
several
of
the
old
executive
and
ask
them
to
help
her
arrange
an
intervention
for
her
son
they
thought
she
be
be
overly
dramatic
besides
they
d
never
see
the
fourth
any
more
impaired
than
a
lot
of
them
get
on
occasion
it
sort
of
go
with
the
territory
they
respectfully
decline
susie
s
request
figure
that
if
they
try
to
rope
the
fourth
into
an
intervention
and
he
didn
t
go
for
it

at
the
hilton
hat
it
when
they
come
down

we

and
they
would
treat

the
former
worker
drew
a
sharp
distinction
between
the
fourth
and
his
guy
however
they
be
obnoxious
prick
who
act
like
everyone
be
beneath
them
he
wasn
t
that
way
he
be
always
smile
ask
people
how
they
be
do
his
guy
didn
t
give
a
shit
he
be
the
nice
easygoing
mellow
fun
love
one
who
never
ask
for
anything
he
work
out
every
day
he
d

be
in
the
gym
at

a
m
i
never
see
him

or

or
anything
the
other
guy
be
drunk
all
the
time
stagger
trash
amid
the
bacchanalia
august
apparently
try
to
maintain
a
level
of
control
he
make
sure
no
one
brought
drug
on
the
big
eagle
say
one
observer
it
be
a
big
thing
with
him
you
be
not
allow
to
be
on
drug
or
posse
them
once
when
he
learn
that
one
of
the
escort
have
call
a
cabdriver
to
bring
her
some
coke
he
have
her
remove
from
the

the
removal
be
effect
by
local
police
officer
that
work
off

for
the

one
of

he

the

get
where
they
be
suppose
to
be

get
rid
of
a
girl
if
the
a
b
executive
decide
they
didn
t
like
her
he
also
make
sure
they
didn
t
carry
any
record
device
or
camera
after
one
escort
obtain
picture
of
the
fourth
in
a
compromise
situation
and
she
be
make
to
leave
town
the
fourth
s
concern
about
people
bring
drug
on
board
may
have
sprung
from
the
fact
that
both
boat
belong
to
bernie
little
a
b
s
longtime
distributor
in
north
central
florida
and
one
of
his
father
s
closest
friend
and
it
could
have
be
because
he
be
on
thin
ice
with
his
father
for
flunk
one
of
the
company
s
random
drug
test
accord
to
the
story
he
told
to
at
least
one
of
his
closest
associate
he
test
positive
for
cocaine
and
the
result
be
relayed
up
the
line
from
the
human
resource
department
to
pat
stokes
s
office
to
his
father
and
the
board
of
director
but
he
d
manage
to
avoid
the
usual
consequence
company
order
counsel
and
subsequent
dismissal
by
vehemently
deny
that
he
have
knowingly

he
claimed
that
somebody
spike
his

that

someone
must
have

it
he
didn
t
report
it
because
he
didn

know
it
have

the

be
not
credible
as
anyone
familiar
with
the
property
and
effect
of
cocaine
would
know
but
august

and

it
after
some
kind
of

an

the

decline
to

to
business
week
for
the
november
article
about
the
management
change
leave
it
to
the
fourth
and
pat

to
speak
for
the
company
and
assure
the
financial
community
that
all
be
well
within
the
beer

the
reporter
pretty
much
ignore
whatever
stokes
have
to
say
and
press
the
fourth
about
his
reputation
as
a
hard
party
guy
point
out
that
it
could
prove
a
hindrance
for
a
company
supposedly
try
a
promote
the
responsible
use
of
its
product
and
ask
him
to
respond
to
story
about
his
frequent
business
trip
with
female
companion
it
s
unlikely
the
fourth
have
ever
be
confront
so
directly
by
a
reporter
about
his
private
life
and
it
apparently
cause
him
to
lose
his
affable
cool
momentarily
claim
that
he
paid
for
the
expense
of
any
guest
who
travel
with
him
and
always
engage
in
responsible
consumption
of
our
product
he
snap
i
didn
t
get
where
i
be
today
without
perform
besides
he
argue
his
vaunt
party
be
actually
a
valuable
form
of
research
i
think
i
have
benefit
from
my
lifestyle
by
be
able
to
be
very
active
in
the
marketplace
he
say
that
have
allow
me
to
understand
our
customer
well
and
hopefully
do
a
well
job
of
create
product
and
image
that
be
attractive
to
that
customer
the
fourth
always
dread
the
inevitable
question
from
reporter
about
his
tucson
accident
and
the
death
of
michele
frederick
why
do
they
keep
bring
that
up
he
often
complain
to
his
colleague
why
do
you
keep
do
the
interview
they
sometimes
reply
this
time
he
respond
to
business
week
with
a
spin
that
could
only
have
be
craft
by
a
b
s
public
relation
department
that
s
a
chapter
that
s
never
go
that
i
will
always
remember
he
say
apparently
forget
that
he
d
long
claimed
total
amnesia
about
that
night
but
i
honestly
believe
that
as
painful
as
the
memory
be
that
experience
will
make
me
a
well
keeper
of
responsibility
for
our
product
he
seem
to
be
say
that
some
good
have
come
from
the
tragedy
after
all
that
michele
have
not
die
in
vain
business
week
rubbed
more
salt
into
the
fourth
s
wound
by
point
out
that
his
father
apparently
share
a
closer
bond
with
his
young
half
brother
steven
and
that
his
stepmother
ginny
have
make
no

wish
to
see
her

great
deal
of

a
very
smart
guy
and
he
do
a
great
job
for
my
father
other
than
that
i
can
t
really
comment
ask
what
he
thought
steven

next
job
with
the
company
might
be
he
reply
tersely
i
don
t
know
of
his
own
future
he
would
only
say
i
don
t
take
anything
for
grant
in
this
company
it
s
not
a
foregone
conclusion
that
i
ll
go
any
farther
i
love
my
father
he
say
take
a
walk
through
my
house
and

museum
every
picture
on

but
he
s
be
extremely
tough
on
me
he
told
business
week
maybe
you
can
call
it
tough
love
or
indulgence
after
all
his
father
have
spent
million
of
dollar
and
an
enormous
amount
of
time
and
energy
shield
him
from
the
consequence
of
his

now
with

yet
another

that
paid
him
nearly
million
a
year
in
salary
bonus
and
stock
with
a
ridiculously
generous
expense
account
and
the
use
of
a
helicopter
and
a
private

his
father
have
even
help
him
acquire
a
new
million

on
ten
wooded
acre

where
his

once
rode

the

ballpark
style
bank
of

light
that
lit
up

so
that
no
one
could
approach
the

very
likely
set
upon
by

he
create

another

haven
where
he
could
do
what
he
want
without
fear
of
interference
from
any
high
authority
all
it
lack
be
a
moat
more
than
just
fodder
for
the
financial
medium
the
relationship
between
the
fourth
and
his
father
be
a
matter
of
constant
conversation
inside
the
company
and
the
busch
family
among
the
latter
group
there
have
long
be
concern
that
august
iii
be
in
denial
about
the
nature
and
extent
of
the
fourth
s
party
in
adolphus
iv
go
to
august
iii
about
rumor
of
his
son
s
cocaine
use
i
need
to
talk
to
you
because
i
be
hearing
that
august
iv
have
a
serious
drug
problem
he
say
i
don
t
have
any
agenda
i
m
not
think
you
be
go
to
can
his
as
and
ask
me
to
come
down
there
and
go
to
work
but
if
people
be
tell
me
about
it
then
it
have
to
be
all
over
the
whole
city
august
iii
confront
the
fourth
who
say
the
rumor
be
not
true
by
august
iii
should
have
have
at
the
very
least
a
strong
suspicion
that
the
fourth
have
a
predilection
for
overindulgence
and
yet
despite
all
he
knew
or
suspect
august
still
put
his
son
in
charge
of
the
brewing
division
which
account
for
percent
of
the
company
s
billion
in
sale
and
percent
of
its
net
income
what
be
he
think
he
be
not
a
reckless
man
in
business
at
least
he
carefully
plan
and
vet
every
move
so
why
then
do
he
risk
hand
the
fourth
more
responsibility
more
authority
indeed
more
temptation
that
s
the

he

he
held
everyone
to
the

when
it
come
to
his

who
would
take
over
the

even
though
august
knew
for
twenty
seven
year
the
problem
his

have
the
most
logical
credible
explanation
be
that
even
after
all
the

the

in

of
the
disappointment
frustration

rage
that
august
felt
he
still
believe
in
his

so
he
double
down
on
the
bloodline
bet
that
his
firstborn
would
finally
emerge
from
his
wild
oat
phase
settle
down
get
married

run
the

out

four

hedge
his

by
stay

longer
than
he

the

it

it

this

when

come

still

it
the

high

he
opt

sell
back
a

the

he
get
from

convince
him
that
if
he

the

those
who

fundamentally
misunderstand
the
behavior
of
many
illegal

they
drink
for
instant
impact
the
fact
that
spykes
be
sell
in
ounce
bottle
and
have
a
total
alcohol
content
equivalent
to
only
one
third
of
a
glass
of
wine
make
it
much
less
likely
that
illegal
underage
drinker
will
choose
spykes
as
oppose
to
similarly

similarly

product

be
to
proof
hard
liquor
those
who
be
concerned
about
the
concealability
of
small
container
should
focus
on
those
hard
liquor
beverage
such
as
airline
mini
bottle
already
on
the
market
that
have
three
to
four
time
great
concentration
of
alcohol
by
volume
than
spykes
the
statement
go
on
if
the
attorney
general
believe
that
ml
bottle
be
a
problem
because
their
size
make
them
easily
concealable
this
standard
should
apply
not
just
to
malt
base
product
but
to
hard
liquor
as
well
one
would
think
that
if
there
be
go
to
be
a
double
standard
apply
it
would
favor
the
low
alcohol
content
product
not
the
type
of
hard
liquor
product
make
by
beam
global
and
other
hard
liquor
manufacturer
one
would
also
think
that
a
year
old
alcoholic
beverage
company
could
come
up
with
a
more
mature
and
measure
response

a
large
group
of
concerned
law
enforcement
official
a

point
so
completely
katz

the
fourth

fingerprint
be
all
over
it
he
apparently
didn

grasp
that
the

weren

so
much
worried
about
underage
college
girl
carry
around
spykes

would
have

it

not
a

too
damn
a

a

say
that
august

have

off
the

it
be
left
to
another
member
of

the
assembly
line
in
the

say
george
hacker
of
the

one
also
wonder
whether
the

truly
hit
bottom
with
spykes
or
whether
it
will
again
stoop
to
market
kid
friendly
drink
after
the
furor
subsides
indeed
the
fact
that

petulant

unapologetic
to

and
that
the

take
no

the

that

that
he
have
to
fulfill
the

the

prior
to
the

the

seemingly
guaranteed
ascension
to

be
threaten
by
a
rumor
that
spread
through
the

rank
i
heard
about
him

two
drug
test
say
a
former

that
he
be
put
on

for
and
a
second
one
that
be
cover
up
the
story
be
know
below
the

committee
level
because
i
heard
about
it
and
i
wasn
t
on
the
committee
it
be
one
of
those
thing
where
senior
executive
would
close
their
office
door
and
say
i
just
heard
that
part
of
the
rumor
be
not
true
the
fourth
have
not
flunk
a
second
drug
test
but
only
because
he
have
conspire
with
a
handful
of
his
underling
to
falsify
the
test
result
the
fourth
s
name
be
pull
again
randomly
and
he
knew
that
he
be
go
to
test
positive
say
a
former
executive
who
learn
about
the
scheme
from
one
of
the
participant
the
test
be
always
do
at
an
independent
contractor
s
location
and
you
have
to
make
an
appointment
and
go
there
so
they
delayed
and
delayed
and
kept
concoct
schedule
conflict
for
him
say
he
be
travel
until
they
finally
get
the
drug
test
contractor
to
send
someone
to
the
office
of
a
b
s
own

in
boston

they
control
the

be
able
to
switch
his
test
sample
with
those
of
a
guy
who
work
there
so
the
fourth
pass

apparently
neither

in
what

an
unintended
moment
of
candor
kate
let
slip
a
sad
fact
of
their
life
together
when
august
first
told
me
about
the
lake
i
have
vision
of
long
romantic
and
quiet
weekend
she
say
little
do
i
know
that
it
would
be
the
two
of

and
several
anheuser
busch

then

it
didn
t
take
long
to
get
use
to
spending
our
weekend
with
everyone
we
always
have
a
great
group
of
people
with
us
he
really
want
to
be
true
to
kate
say
one
of
the
fourth
s
male
friend
i
think
that
last
three
month
by
then
of
course
he
d
be
promote
to
ceo

the
last

long
await
coronation
of
august
iv
as
chief
executive
officer
of
anheuser

come
on
september
begin
with
a
statement
from
the
board
of
director
after
careful
consideration
we
select
august
busch
iv
as
the
individual
most
qualify
to
assume
that
role
we
believe
that
the
company
its
employee
and
its
shareholder
will
be
well
serve
by
his
leadership
august
iii
who
be
resign
from
all
executive
responsibility
at
age
sixty
eight
say
of
his
son
august
iv
have
successfully
prepared
himself
by
lead
the
u
s
beer
company
through
a
period
of
great
change
and
challenge
he
brings
with
him
the
new
think
of
his
generation
yet
appreciation
for
the
great
tradition
and
value
of
the
company
for
sheer
disingenuousness
the
two
statement
would
be
hard
to
top
the
board
member
knew
well
than
anyone
that
the
fourth
s
record
of
leadership
be
questionable
his
five
year
as
president
have
be
marked
by
flat
sale
an
underperform
stock
and
a
series
of
expensive
tv
commercial
that
won
rave
review
but
relatively
few
new
customer
at

two
key
longtime

during
his
presidency
each
state
in
their
official
exit
interview
one
directly
to
august
iii
that
they
be
leave
because
they
have
no
faith
in
the
fourth
s
ability
to
lead
the
brewing
division
the
board
s
decision
to
elect
pat
stokes
as
chairman
of
the

and
to
allow
august
iii
to
stay
on
as
a
member
even
after
he
retire
be
a
clear
sign
that
they
didn
t
trust
the
fourth
s
ability
or
his
judgment
to
say
that
he
be
the
individual
most
qualify
for
the
job
fell
somewhere
between
dishonest
and
delusional
the
statement
be
boilerplate
corporate
blather
of

fashion
by
public
relation
consultant
intent
on
assure
the
invest
world
that
all
thing
be
as
they
should

but
august
iii
s
statement
contain
a
paragraph
that
no
one
would
have
dare
to
write
for
him
it
stand
out
as
perhaps
the
most
emotional
publish
remark
of
his
forty
five
year
career
this
company
be
like
no
other
he
say
for
me
this
have
never
be
just
a
job
it
have
be
my
passion
i
ve
take
great
pleasure
in
work
with
people
of
character
creativity
and
commitment
who
have
become
my
second
family
above
all
it
be
the
men
and
woman
with
whom
i
have
work
that
i
will
miss
most
august
iv
s
official
statement
contain
the
requisite
expression
of
gratitude
and
respect
for
his
predecessor
i
be
proud
to
accept
this
challenge
that
carry
a
great
deal
of
personal
meaning
for
me
my
father
and
pat
stokes
leave
behind
a
legacy
of
unparalleled
excellence
but
privately
he
be
deeply
disappointed
at
the
way
thing
work
out
when
he
walk
into
his
first
board
of
director
meeting
in
december
the
two
men
he
d
report
to
for
the
past
twenty
year
would
be
sit
there
still
judging
his
performance
both
have
take
big
retirement
package
million
for
stokes
and
million
for
august
iii
but
august
iii
be
go
to
serve
as
a
consultant
for
another
six
year
during
which
time
the
company
would
continue
to
cover
the
cost
of
his
security
and
travel
include
his
jet
and
helicopter
and
maintain
his
executive
office
at
busch
place
so
his
father
wasn
t
even
leave
the
building
supposedly
august
iii
be
go
to
serve
as
just
another
member
of
the
board
the
notion
be
ridiculous
if
august
iii
be
in
the
boardroom
by
dint
of
history
and
force
of
personality
he
would
be
the
man
in
charge
the
nuclear
particle
would
align
so
the
promotion
to
ceo
didn
t
change
much
for
the
fourth
except
that
as
he
ruefully
note
to
forbes
magazine
i
m
the
one
who
be
go
to
be
accountable
he
face
some
formidable
problem
all
the
major
u
s
brewer
be
lose
young
consumer
to
import
brand
microbrews
wine
and
distil
spirit
budweiser
have
lose
percent
of
its
market
share
since
as
president
the
fourth
s
strategy
have
be
to
fight
the
competition
by
join
them
in
addition
to
jekyll
hyde
spykes
and
bacardi
silver
he
add
fourteen
microbrew

to
a
product
roster
that
now
numbered
more
than
forty

such
seemingly
whimsical
concoction
as
chelada
bud
michelob
ultra
lime
cactus
and
michelob
ultra
tuscan
orange
grapefruit
it
definitely
wasn
t
his
grandfather

beer
company
anymore
in
his
first
major
move
as
ceo
the

enter
into
a

with

base
inbev
that

distributor
of

s
best
know
european
brand
beck
s
bass

and
stella
artois
his
father
object
to
the
idea
when
it
be
first
propose
in
he
d
dealt
directly
with
inbev
s
key
brazilian
backer
and
didn

trust

inbev
be
now
a
b

big
competitor
on
the
world
stage
and
be
widely
rumor
to
be
eye
a
b
as
a
possible
takeover
target
august
iii
thought
it
be
a
bad
idea
to
get
into
a
partnership
that
would
give
inbev
a
window
onto
a
b
s
operation
but
the
fourth
kept
push
for
it
and
in
an
uncharacteristic
display
of
restraint
his
father
didn
t
try
to
marshal
support
on
the
board
to
block
the
deal
he
let
it
happen
and
inbev
move
into
a
small
office
just
across
pestalozzi
street
from
the
a
b
executive
office
at
busch
place
the
takeover
rumor
be
well
found
for
year
a
b
have
be
protect
by
its
size
and
stock
price
it
be
simply
too
big
and
too
expensive
to
be
swallow
by
a
competitor
but
thing
have
change
a
b
wasn
t
the
big
brewer
anymore
its
stock
be
undervalue
its
record
of
year
in
operation
wasn
t
so
intimidate
in
an
industry
whose
world
leader
have
not
even
exist
four
year
before
inbev
be
not
so
much
a
brewer
as
it
be
an
investment
portfolio
of
beer
brand
more
than
two
hundred
of
them
that
its
owner
have
amass
by
gulp
down
six
hundred
year
old
european

so
as
august

take
over
the
job
he
have
covet
so
for
long
he
be
buffet
from
all
side
by
warning
that
sooner

later
inbev

offer
him
some
respite
from
the
doom

at
a
rate
of

and
a

met
with
the

during
his

as

he
come
off

about
him
not
the

we

who
be

in
his
youth
he
be
clearly
very
bright
the
journalist
say
he
have
a
tremendous
memory
and
could
roll
off
stats
about
the
industry
and
story
about
the
challenge
his
father
have
face
through
the
year
but
he
tend
to
go
off
on
tangent
in
his
conversation
jumping
around
like
a
jackrabbit
veer
from
one
subject
to
the
next
he
didn
t
shy
away
from
talk
about
the

rumor
and
the

the
company
face
but
he
sometimes
ramble
on
about
inconsequential
beer
history
the
takeover
story
die
down
during
the
summer
of
when
nothing
happen
but
it
heat
back
up
again
in
october
when
sabmiller
and
molson
coors
the
no
and
no
brewer
in
the
united

announce
they

their

operation

millercoors
a

of

would
control
about
percent
of
the
u

significantly
reduce

advantage
shortly
after

people
with
a
fortune
estimate
at
billion
the
fourth
believe
the
meeting
be
a
casual
one
when
lemann
mention
the
millercoors
deal
and
suggest
that
a
b
and
inbev
consider
a
merger
the
fourth
apparently
didn
t
perceive
it
as
a
serious
proposal
he
brush
the
suggestion
aside
as
if
it
be
an
off
the
cuff
remark
say
he
have
other
plan
for
reinvigorate
his
company
but
lemann
be
dead
serious
about
a
merger
and
the
fact
that
the
fourth
do
not
pick
up
on
that
or
report
lemann
s
comment
back
to
the
a
b
board
in
a
way
that
set
off
alarm
bell
be
an
indication
of
how
unprepared
he
be
to
play
in
this
ballpark
have
be
rebuffed
twice
on
the
idea
of
a
friendly
merger
by
august
iii
in
and
now
his

lemann

to
acquire

less

mean
it
appear
that
the
fourth
similarly
misjudge
the
situation
with
carlos
brito
the
man
lemann
put
in
place
as
ceo
of

an

in
many
way
the

eschew

built

reputation
as
a
ruthless
cost

and
wholehearted
proponent
of
lemann

zero

philosophy
which
supposedly

the
more

we

have
at
the
end
of
the

to

and
yet
the
fourth
thought
it
be
a
good
idea
to
invite
brito
to
a
b
s
annual

meeting
with

the

most
conspicuous
display
of
over
the
top
spending
the

rumor
reignite
in
the
spring
of
fuel
by
the
wall
street
journal
s
gossipy
but
usually
reliable
heard
on
the
street
column
which
report
that
a
b
and
inbev
already
have
held
discussion
accord
to
people
in
the
industry
familiar
with
both
brewer
think
note
that
report
of
the
talk
surface
as
long
as
a
year
ago
the
column
say
they
have
become
more
serious
and
a
deal
be
possible
this
year
people
in
the
industry
say
in
truth
the
two
company
have
not
have
any
talk
other
than
the
brief
exchange
between
august
iv
and
jorge

in

in
the
wake
of
the
item
however
the
price
of

briefly
jumped
percent
the
journal
kept
on
the
story
reporting
on
april
that
during
a
b
s
annual
sale
meeting
with

in

a
few

earlier
august

to
its
foot
by
declare
there
would
be
no

not
on
my
watch
the
journal
attribute
the
story
to
source
in
the
room
but
the
company
refuse
to
confirm
or
deny
the
fourth

statement
we
have
a
meeting
with

the
fourth
have
blunder
again
it
be
naive
of
him
to
think
that
anything
he
say
to
a
crowd
of
five
hundred
people
be
confidential
or
would
stay
that
way
for
long
and
to
publicly
reject
a

offer
even
before
it
be
make
smack
of

would
do
such
a

he

it
be
not

from

the

that
the

s
workday
usually
didn
t
begin
until
the
early
afternoon
and
continued
into
the
early
morning
the
latter
hour
conduct
in
bar
restaurant
or
increasingly
his
home
where
some
member
of
his
inner
circle
gather
nearly
every
night
his
guy
would
come
over
and
they
would
watch
tv
it
be
work
but
they
be
also
like
his
family
say
a
confidant
who
claim
he
be
sometimes
there
five
or
six
night
a
week
scarface
be
his
favorite
movie
they
watch
it
religiously
as
the
night
wore
on
he
would
get
more
drunk
he
drank
beer
and
wine
mostly
he
usually
have
a
chef
there
to
cook
and
a
housekeeper
and
two
a
b
security
guy
by
then
the
fourth
have
return
to
his
playboy
way
when
he
travel
or
when
his
wife
kate
be
out
of
town
in
the
latter
case
he
make
sure
the
security
camera
recording
at
the
house
be
erase
before
she
return
so
she
wouldn
t
find
out
what
go
on
while
she
be
away
kate
thought
she
could
change
him
say
one
of
august
s
confidant
but
it
be
never
go
to
happen
give
the
fourth
s
increasingly
dissolute
behavior
his
closest
associate
be
not
shock
when
he
show
up
load
at
the
national
beer
wholesaler
conference
in
washington
d
c
but
the
five
hundred
or
so
a
b
distributor
who
watch
as
he
walk
unsteadily
into
the
grand
ballroom
of
the
hyatt
on
the
afternoon
of
may
be
stun
by
his
condition
the
wholesaler
for
all
the
brand
be
at
the
convention
at
least
a
thousand
of
them
along
with
the
large
brewer
sabmiller
molson
coors
inbev
say
an
a
b
distributor
who
be
in
the
ballroom
the
fourth
be
go
to
be
our
headliner
but
he
didn
t
get
very
far
he
stumble
over
word
as
if
he
be
reading
from
a
teleprompter
in
a
different
language
his
speech
be
slur
halt
and
very
deliberate
it
be
obvious
that
he
could
not
focus
this
be
clearly
not
from
overindulge
in
a
beverage
of
moderation
it
wasn
t
booze
something
else
be
go
on
it
be
painful
to
see
the
face
of
our
company
in
such
a
state
in
public
when
it
be
over
it
be
all
anyone
talk
about
that
even
and
for
many
day
afterwards
recall
another
distributor
who
witness
the
meltdown
i
couldn
t
believe
that
his
people
let
him
get
up
there
like
that
obviously
they
be
in
disarray
this
be
not
a
home
game
we
be
in
the
nation
s
capital
the
distributor
go
on
there
be
no
secret
in
the
beer
business
anyway
no
matter
what
you
sell
it
s
all
a
big
fraternity
so
everyone
knew
about
this
i
have
to
believe
it
factor
into
what
inbev
do
they
thought
if
that
s
the
leader
then
something
be
terribly
wrong
in
all
likelihood
brito
and
company
already
knew
about
the
fourth
s
weakness
they
weren
t
barbarian
at
the
gate
after
all
they
d
be
inside
the
wall
for
more
than
a
year
and
in
any
significant
corporate
acquisition
it
be
standard
practice
for
the
prospective
buyer
to
conduct
a
due
diligence
investigation
that
include
a
rigorous
vet
of
the
ceo
and
his
management
team
to
determine
whether
they
should
be
kept
on
after
the
takeover
the
investigation
usually
be
conduct
either
by
big
law
firm
or
private
investigative
agency
such
as
kroll
which
employ
former
investigative
journalist
and
retire
law
enforcement
officer
to
gather
intelligence
depend
on
the
size
of
the
company
and
the
risk
involve
these
due
diligence
investigation
can
be
exhaustive
and
expensive
sometimes
cost
up
to
half
a
million
dollar
or
more
and
because
the
investigative
report
be
provide
to
the
client
on
a
confidential
basis
its
so
call
executive
summary
often
contains
a
good
deal
of
unproven
gossip
which
can
be
as
significant
to
a
buyer
as
fact
when
it
come
to
gossip
of
course

the

there
be
little

as
to
the

the

package
and

that

but
he
insist
he
would

his

during

we
can
t

he

but
we
do
control
our

how
we
operate
our

it
be
our

in
way
that
will
keep
the

strong
profitable
and
grow
in

that
sound
like
something
his

he
add
some
of

would
like
nothing
well

out
at

the
fourth
s
uncle
adolphus
busch
iv
read
the
financial
time
story
with
interest
and
concern
as
the
owner
of
a
substantial
amount
of
a
b
share
and
a
financial
partner
in
a
large
a
b
distributorship
in
houston
he
d
be
frustrate
for
some
time
with
the
lackluster
performance
of
the
stock
now
apparently
the
a
b
board
be
about
to
be
offer
a
percent
premium
on
the
go
price
of
the
share
and
his
nephew
have
already
say
no
how
could
he
do
that
adolphus
knew
a
b
have
little
defense
against
a
serious
takeover
attempt
the
busch
family
own
less
than
percent
of
the
stock
not
enough
to
swing
a
decision
one
way
or
another
even
in
the
unlikely
event
that
they
all
agree
on
which
way
to
go
in
the
past
few
year
the
company
have
drop
its
so
call
poison
pill
provision
which
allow
stockholder
to
buy
new
stock
at
a
discount
in
the
face
of
a
takeover
threat
thereby
make
an
acquisition
more
expensive
for
an
unwanted
suitor
in
response
to
shareholder
pressure
the
board
also
have
do
away
with
stagger
election
whereby
only
a
third
of
its
member
stood
for
reelection
each
year
so
now
an
unfriendly
suitor
could
nominate
a
new
slate
of
candidate
and
replace
the
entire
sit
board
at
a
single
shareholder
meeting
adolphus
thought
per
share
be
a
hell
of
an
offer
he
couldn
t
imagine
the
current
director
turn
it
down
they
d
risk
spending
the
next
five
year
in
court
defend
themselves
against
shareholder
lawsuit
so
what
be
the
fourth
do
with
that
not
on
my
watch
comment
over
the
memorial
day
weekend
he
put
in
several
call
to
august
iii
and
august
iv
to
see
what
be
go
on
august
iii
didn
t
respond
and
when
the
fourth
finally
get
back
to
him
his
description
of
the
plan
for
fight
the
takeover
seem
disconnect
from
the
urgent
reality
he
say
he
be
confident
his
management
team
could
build
more
shareholder
value
than
inbev
could
offer
by
improve
profitability
and
stock
performance
through
a
cost
cut
program
code
name
blue
ocean
that
would
eliminate
more
than
half
a
billion
dollar
in
spending
over
the
next
two
year
that
sound
like
bullshit
to
me
adolphus
say
recently
and
it
told
me
that
they
really
didn
t
have
a
plan
on
monday
may
he
contact
david
kesmodel
the
wall
street
journal
reporter
who
d
be
cover
the
story
and
told
him
that
contrary
to
what
his
nephew
have
say
some
member
of
the
busch
family
be
open
to
merger
discussion
with
inbev
there
be
member
that
absolutely
want
it
to
stay
status
quo
he
say
and
there
be
others
that
say
they
want
to
see
some
kind
of
chance
to
enhance
shareholder
value
the
next
morning
it
become
obvious
that
the
fourth
have
commit
another
unforced
error
he
d
give
a
phone
interview
to
the
wall
street
journal
several
week
earlier
in
which
he
d
spoken
a
little
too
freely
the
result
be
an
article
in
which
he
seem
to
make
the
inbev
story
all
about
him
anheuser
ceo
fight
for
his
legacy
the
headline
read
as
rival
weighs
a
bid
busch
heir
still
seek
father
s
approval
in
what
function

to
the
financial
time
revelation
the
fourth

dealt
with
his
father
and
their
troubled
relationship
i
never
ever
have
a
father
son
relationship
he
say
it
s
always
be
purely
business
his
transition
to
ceo
have
be
a
very
difficult
fluid
situation
he
say
because
he
and
his
father
have
clashed
over
issue
range
from
his
choice
for
his
executive
team
if
i
can
t
have
my
team
then
how
can
you
hold
me
accountable
to
his
scuttle

to
buy
the
juice
beverage
manufacturer

of
his

he
s
brilliant
and
he
have
so
much
to
offer
so
long
as
when
he
offer
it
it
come
as

however
a

at

journal
about

open

with

be
widely
interpret
in
the

as
evidence
of
a

family
feud
adolphus
have
subsequently
come
out
in
favor
of
inbev
s
billion
offer
say
that
brito

have
satisfied
his

about
preserve
the
legacy
of
the
company
a
possible

be
not
a

issue
he
say
it
be
strictly
a
matter
of
shareholder
value
his
young
brother
andrew
promptly
release
a
statement
support
august
iii
and
august
iv
i
for
one
trust
the
current
a
b
board
to
put
a
b
shareholder
first
he
say
and
have
no
reason
to
think
that
inbev
s
propose
board
member
will
have
the
same
devotion
to
shareholder
interest
the
difference
between
the
two
stem
more
from
their
partnership
along
with
their
brother
billy
in
an
a

distributorship
in
houston
that
strain
relation
among
all
three
of
them

mostly
between
adolphus
and
andrew
who
have
rarely
spoken
in
recent
year
other
busch
family
member
be
more
ambivalent
about
the
potential
inbev
buyout
and
their
opinion
be
evolve
rapidly
when
i
first
heard
there
be
an
offer
from
carlos
brito
i
be
against
it
say
billy
busch
recently
the
company
have
meant
so
much
to
me
and
my
family
there
be
so
much
pride
and
history
involve
that
i
didn
t
want
to
see
it
go
i
thought
august
iv
be
just
go
to
have
to
raise
himself
up
and
turn
it
around
somehow
but
then
i
start
think
about
it
and
as
much
as
i
hat
to
see
it
go
my
business
sense
told
me
that
maybe
this
be
the
time
it
help
that
billy
held

billy
now
stood
to
make
more

million
on
a
sale
to
inbev
it
be
generally
agree
that
the
a
b
board
have
only
one
play
to
make
if
they
want
avoid
the
takeover
and
that
be
to
acquire
the
half
of
mexico
s
grupo
modelo
that
a
b
didn
t
already
own
such
a
merger
would
add
anywhere
from
billion
to
billion
to
the
value
of
the
company
possibly
make
it
too
expensive
for
inbev
to
swallow
inbev
claimed
to
have
secure
billion
in
financing
mostly
from
european
bank
but
the
worldwide
recession
of
be
in
full
swing
and
credit
be
become
increasingly
hard
to
come
by
the
modelo
gambit
be
a
long
shot
however
since
a
b
have
invest
more
than
billion
in
the
brewery
gradually
acquire
a
percent
noncontrolling
interest
but
the
partnership
have
be
an
uneasy
one
and
august
iii
be
not
exactly
beloved
by
the
five
mexican
family
that
control
their
country
s
large
brewery
because
the

have
form
a

with

forty
one
year
old
ceo
carlos
fernandez
he
and
his
strategy
committee
be
assign
the
task
of
try
to
negotiate
a
merger
agreement
the
fourth
saw
it
as
a
last
chance
to
redeem
himself
and
friend
say
he
get
caught
up
in
the
idea
that
he
could
save
anheuser
busch
for
the
city
the
shareholder
and
his
family
the
way
his
grandfather
gussie
have
save
the
cardinal
if
he
pull
it
off
he
would
be
the
hero
of
the
story
and
not
held
accountable
forever
for
let
the
dynasty
go
down
on
his
watch
he
might
finally
win
his
father
s
respect
over
a
period
of
several
week
the
fourth
and
his
team
hammer
out
an
agreement
whereby
a
b
would
pay
billion
for
the
remain
percent
of
modelo
and
carlos
fernandez
would
be
name
ceo
of
the
merge
company
which
would
be
call
anheuser
busch

but
the
a
b
board
balk
at
the
idea
as
much
as
they
believe
that
fernandez
would
be
a
much
well
ceo
than
august
iv
they
didn
t
want
to
pay
a
premium
for
modelo
and
at
the
same
time
appear
to
turn
over
control
to
the
mexican
they
thought
that
would
surely
invite
shareholder
lawsuit
as
august
iii
say
i
don
t
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
my
life
in
deposition
i
be
with

the
night
they
told
him
they
weren

the
only
notable
find
during
the

no
apparent
cause
of

it
would
be
up
to
the
toxicology
report
to
tell
the
tale
and
they
wouldn
t
be
complete
for
four
to
six
week
it
wasn
t
until
december
four
day
after

s
death
that
the
frontenac
police
department
get
around
to
tell
the
public
about
it
and
even
then
the
disclosure
be
only
in
response
to
a
call
from
a
post
dispatch
reporter
act
on
a
tip
ask
why
the

have
wait
so
long
police
chief
tom
becker
respond
matter
of
factly
that
the

have
release
information
as
soon
as
it
receive
medium
inquiry
and
after
approval
by
the
city
attorney
the
implication
be
that
have
it
not
be
for
an
enterprising
reporter
the
mysterious
death
of
a
young

initial
press
release
state
incorrectly

death
and
its
disclosure
seem
even
longer
the
department
quickly
correct
the
error
but
the
impression
have
be
create
that
the
authority
be
somehow
cover
for
the
busch
family
who
else
would
benefit
from
keep
the
story
out
of
the

indeed
the

initially
refuse
to
say
whether
august

have
be
in
the
house
when
martin
die
on
christmas

life
it
be
everything
he
knew
i
think
he
s
try
to
figure
out
what
he
want
to
do
he
just
expect
that
would
be
his
life
and
suddenly
it
wasn
t
anymore
as
a
kicker
the
article
quote
judy
buchmiller
to
whom
he
be
engage
in
i
wouldn
t
want
anything
bad
to
happen
to
him
he
s
a
good
guy
he
s
really
misunderstood
the
capper
in
the
sympathy
campaign
however
be
a
post
dispatch
article
base
on
an
interview
the
fourth
give
to
the
newspaper
s
gossip
columnist
deb
peterson
it
quote
busch
say
that
he
love
this
girl
with
every
ounce
of
my
heart
it
s
the
saddest
thing
i
ve
ever
dealt
with
i
ve
be
through
some
pretty
bad
thing
the
past
two
year
and
she
be
always
by
my
side
she
be
the
only
girl
i
ve
ever
be
with
that
i
didn
t
want
to
have
someone
on
the
side
you
know
i
m
this
notorious
bachelor
who
always
want
someone
on
the
side
but
i
didn
t
with
adrienne
the
latter
comment
be
so
weirdly
and
inappropriately
confessional
that
a
local
tv
station
froze
it
on
the
screen
for
a
few
extra
second
when
reporting
about
the
interview
peterson
quote
the
fourth
as
say
he
be
fall
in
love
with
adrienne
s
son
i
ve
never
spent
much
time
around
kid
that
age
before
he
say
they
don
t
care
who
you
be
or
what
you
have
they
just
accept
you
the
way
you
be
he
say
he
talk
to
her
mother
on
the
phone
every
day
for
few
hour
it
s
the
only
thing
that
make
me
feel
well
he
claimed
that
he
be
talk
to
his
father
again
too
i
love
you
that
s
what
i
told
him
i
love
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
he
say
his
father
respond
in
kind
and
advise
him
to
get
some
grief
counsel
i
don
t
know
if
individual
counsel
be
the
way
to
go
or
something
else
i
ve
get
to
figure
something
out
i
can
t
let
this
take
me
down
the
interview
apparently
be
short
on
hard
question
if
peterson
ask
him
whether
he
take
drug
with
adrienne
it
wasn
t
indicate
the
closest
the
article
come
to
the
topic
be
the
fourth
s
admission
that
he
have
be
in
rehab
in
for
depression
and
my
other
issue
on
which
he
would
not
elaborate
peterson
write
in
a
separate
article
the
newspaper
editorialize
on
its
exclusive
liken
the
fourth
to
the
pitcher
yanked
from
the
baseball
game
too
early
just
a
couple
of
inning
in
left
wonder
what
might
have
be
the
editorial
end
by
repeat
his
comment
about
how
kid
just
accept
you
the
way
you
be
then
add
it
seem
that
throughout
his
life
busch
iv
have
want
nothing
more
than
this
the
interview
turn
out
to
be
the
fourth
s
last
word
on
the
subject
a
week
later
art
margulis
contact
detective
james
ford
and
inform
him
that
he
have
advise
his
client
to
make
no
far
statement
regard
adrienne
s
death
the
result
of
the
toxicology
report
be
finally
release
on
february
adrienne
martin
have
die
from
oxycodone
intoxication
at
a
joint
press
conference
the
next
day
frontenac
police
chief
tom
becker
and
st
louis
county
prosecutor
robert
mcculloch
reveal
that
her
body
also
contain
enough
cocaine
to
kill
her
in
fact
the
test
indicate
that
she
have
ingest
cocaine
within
an
hour
of
her
death
and
oxycodone
within
six
hour
trace
of
the
drug
be
detect
in
the
empty
prescription
bottle
found
on
the
dresser
and
cocaine
residue
be
found
in
the
plastic
straw
discover
under
the
mattress
which
meant
that
either
adrienne
have
snort
the
very
last
line
of
coke
and
then
lay
down
on
the
bed
and
die
or
someone
have
gotten
rid
of
the
rest
of
it
before
the
paramedic
and
police
arrive
mcculloch
s
frustration
be
palpable
when
he
note
that
neither
the
oxycodone
nor
the
cocaine
be
prescribed
and
they
didn
t
just
drop
out
of
the
sky
but
because
the
cause
of
death
be
clearly
an
accidental
overdose
that
do
not
lend
itself
to
a
manslaughter
prosecution
and
because
august
iv
have
refuse
to
cooperate
the
investigation
as
to
where
the
drug
come
from
be
at
a
dead
end
he
say
consequently
no
charge
would
be
file
against
the
fourth
the
fourth
s
attorney
art
margulis
sum
it
up
smugly
for
reporter
if
you
can
reflect
back
to
december
you
may
recall
that
we
release
a
statement
say
it
be
an
unfortunate
tragedy
and
it
really
be
he
say
and
we
also
say
in
that
statement
there
be
no
suspicious
circumstance
and
i
think
that
s
now
be
borne
out
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
matter
be
close
in
st
louis
and
elsewhere
the
general
reaction
to
the
news
be
that
august
iv
have
gotten
away
with
it
yet
again
because
of
his
name
and
his
money
he
d
avoid
the
consequence
that
a
less
privileged
person
would
have
suffer
among
those
most
upset
about
the
prosecutor
s
decision
to
drop
the
case
be
george
larry
eby
of
springfield
missouri
adrienne
martin
s
estrange
father
who
told
the
new
york
time
he
be
not
go
to
stop
try
to
find
the
answer
to
why
his
daughter
die
mr
busch
doesn
t
know
me
but
he
will
when
i
m
do
on
march
ab
inbev
make
the
unsurprising
announcement
that
august
iv
would
not
seek
reelection
to
the
board
of
director
in
april
and
be
leave
the
company
for
personal
and
health
reason
two
day
later
dr
kevin
martin
file
a
wrongful
death
lawsuit
against
august
iv
on
behalf
of
his
son
blake
seek
unspecified
damage
for
carelessness
and
neglect
curiously
the
fourth
file
a
response
almost
simultaneously
deny
the
claim
of
carelessness
and
negligence
but
agree
to
move
jurisdiction
of
the
case
from
st
louis
to
cape
girardeau
where
kevin
and
blake
martin
live
legal
expert
smell
a
deal
between
the
two
almost
brother
under
missouri
law
a
family
can
file
only
one
wrongful
death
lawsuit
so
kevin
martin
s
move
could
be
see
as
a
rush
to
the
courthouse
to
prevent
adrienne
s
parent
christine
trampler
and
larry
eby
from
filing
a
separate
claim
the
fourth
quickly
offer
to
pay
million
to
settle
the
suit
with
no
admission
of
responsibility
and
kevin
martin
just
as
quickly
agree
to
it
but
before
a
judge
approve
the
settlement
trampler
and
eby
file
motion
to
intervene
trampler
s
motion

by
prominent
new

litigator
john
q
kelly
argue
that
martin
shouldn
t
be
allow
to
represent
the
boy
because
of
his
personal
relationship
with
august
iv
it
also
question
martin
s
fitness
as
a
parent
and
allege
that
busch
have
provide
adrienne
with
illegal
substance
without
her
knowledge
or
consent
that
kelly
would
take
on
a
client
in
tiny
ozark
missouri
reinforce
the
feel
that
give
the
fourth
s
enormous
resource
million
be
a
lowball
offer
for
a
kid
who
have
lose
his
mother
a
few
day
before
christmas
the
court
do
not
approve
the
propose
settlement
agreement
and
adrienne
martin
s
ex
boyfriend
ex
husband
and
divorce
parent
be
still
in
a
legal
fight
over
how
much
money
should
be
paid
to
her
little
boy
and
who
should
oversee
it
on
a
weekday
afternoon
in
the
spring
of
august
iv
drew
look
from
other
shopper
as
he
and
a
male
companion
stood
in
the
checkout
line
at
sam
s
club
in
west
st
louis
county
wear
low
hang
baggy
jean
a
white
t
shirt
and
crocs
he
be
just
barely
recognizable
as
the
formerly
trim
and
handsome
head
of
anheuser
busch
he
d
gain
considerable
weight
his
hair
be
clearly
dyed
and
an
observer
say
he
give
the
distinct
impression
that
he
be
under
the
influence
of
something
when
the
cashier
say
to
him
playfully
oh
we
ve
heard
of
you
he
respond
and
i
m
sure
all
of
it
be
bad
he
then
left
his
companion
to
pay
for
several
cart
worth
of
supply
and
walk
out
of
the
store
after
his
companion
follow
the
cashier
say
to
the
next
customer
in
line
you
know
who
that
be
don
t
you
get
an
affirmative
nod
she
say
he
come
in
here
like
that
all
the
time
the
world
must
be
just
a
blur
to
him
as
described
by
several
people
who
still
see
him
the
life
of
august
busch
iv
these
day
be
not
one
that
many
people
would
choose
since
adrienne
martin
s
death
the
guy
don
t
come
to
the
house
anymore
his
security
detail
be
go
all
but
one
or
two
of
his
employee
have
left
either
frighten
away
or
fire
despite
what
he
may
tell
people
he
and
his
father
do
not
speak
he
still
talk
about
august
iii
all
the
time
however
and
life
with
the
knowledge
that
he
be
probably
the
big
disappointment
of
his
father
s
life
as
one
former
a
b
executive
put
it
all
august
iii
ever
want
out
of
the
fourth
be
performance
and
he
never
get
it
after
the
inbev
takeover
august
iii
recede
from
public
view
for
a
time
but
more
recently
he
s
become
actively
involve
in
a
number
of
charitable
and
political
endeavor
include
the
general
election
he
s
also
be
robustly
involve
in
building
a
new
million
home
at
waldmeister
farm
accord
to
family
and
friend
he
maintains
a
close
relationship
with
his
three
other
child
susan
steven
and
ginny
but
rarely
speaks
about
august
iv
and
no
one
expect
that
he
will
ever
tell
his
version
of
the
story
as
for
the
fourth
his
few
remain
friend
say
that
his
issue
be
bad
than
ever
before
at
this
point
august
have
no
respect
for
his
family
or
his
employee
and
he
especially
doesn
t
have
any
respect
for
himself
say
one
longtime
friend
i
think
he
will
die
he
be
in
effect
dead
already
he
doesn
t
care
he
have
everything
in
the
world
and
he
doesn
t
know
it
say
another
long
suffer
friend
i
have
sat
up
night
with
august
so
that
he
wouldn
t
choke
on
his
own
vomit
and
die
i
don
t
care
anymore
if
he
dy
he
d
be
well
off
i
just
don
t
want
anyone
else
to
die
