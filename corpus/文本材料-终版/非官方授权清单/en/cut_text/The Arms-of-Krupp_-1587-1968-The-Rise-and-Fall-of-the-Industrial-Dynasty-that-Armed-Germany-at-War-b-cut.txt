prologue
anvil
of
the
reich
in
archduke
franz
ferdinand
of
austria
be
assassinate
at
sarajevo
and
little
of
the
europe
he
have
know
survive
him
his
wife
his
title
even
his
country
vanished
in
the
red
madness
of
the
time
the
assassin
have
unhinged
the
world
which
be
the
only
reason
we
remember
their
victim
the
blunt
truth
be
that
he
have
be
brutal
and
mulish
a
klotz
yet
every
funeral
have
its
pathetic
personal
detail
and
among
the
petty
but
vex
problem
raise
by
the
archduke
s
unexpected
demise
be
the
issue
of
what
his
executor
be
to
do
with
his
hunt
lodge
near
werfen
austria
for
four
hundred
year
the
lodge
really
an
immense
villa
have
be
one
of
the
home
of
the
archbishop
of
salzburg
who
have
commute
between
there
their
renaissance
cathedral
their
theological
seminary
east
of
munich
and
their
two
archepiscopal
palace
on
the
salzach
river
in
the
new
enlighten
europe
however
the
ecclesiastical
hierarchy
have
yield
to
royalty
the
dull
click
of
rosary
bead
have
be
replace
by
the
clean
sharp
crack
of
sportsman
s
rifle
franz
ferdinand
whatever
his
other
weakness
have
be
a
superb
shot
in
the
teem
forest
surround
his
lodge
he
have
broken
all
slaughter
record
his
trophy
fill
the
hall
thus
the
sentimental
viennese
felt
that
the
new
owner
of
bl
hnbach
should
know
something
about
gun
but
the
eighty
room
ch
teau
be
expensive
eventually
their
dilemma
be
solve
brilliantly
by
gustav
krupp
von
bohlen
und
halbach
of
essen
germany
gustav
krupp
be
well
acquaint
with
gun
he
be
in
fact
the
continent
s
lead
cannon
manufacturer
the
krupp
have
be
look
for
a
new
country
home
far
from
their
weapon
forge
in
the
sooty
smelly
ruhr
valley
so
gustav
and
his
family
acquire
the
estate
with
its
superb
view
of
the
austrian
alp
beneath
one
of
whose
peak
the
legendary
twelfth
century
emperor
frederick
barbarossa
be
say
to
lie
asleep
in
a
cave
ready
to
spring
to
germany
s
aid
whenever
the
black
raven
circle
overhead
warn
him
that
the
sacred
soil
of
his
first
reich
be
in
danger
in
the
long
sweep
of
history
the
sale
of
bl
hnbach
seem
scarcely
worth
a
footnote
yet
in
a
way
it
be
a
parable
of
the
era
since
the
dawn
of
modern
europe
the
mysterious
powerful
krupp
dynasty
have
flourish
on
war
and
rumor
of
war
its
steel
forge
have
disgorge
armor
bayonet
field
gun
shell
battleship
armor
and
flotilla
of
submarine
always
at
immense
profit
to
the
house
of
krupp
after
franz
ferdinand
s
death
the
central
power
sprang
to
arm
thereby
confront
the
house
with
a
stupendous
market
thus
there
be
a
fine
analogue
in
member
of
the
family
enter
archducal
forest
trigger
finger
tense
stalk
prey
they
be
in
fact
symbol
of
the
fatherland
s
national
mood
everything
about
the
krupp
be
remarkable
their
way
of
life
secretive
their
appearance
vulpine
their
empire
international
and
their
customer
chief
of
state
but
nothing
be
quite
so
phenomenal
as
this
habit
of
match
the
teuton
mood
of
the
moment
in
the
middle
age
when
germany
be
weak
the
krupp
appear
and
ply
their
trade
modestly
in
the
wall
city
of
essen
during
the
napoleonic
era
when
the
country
felt
servile
the
head
of
the
house
don
a
french
cockade
and
become
a
francophile
then
in
the
next
half
century
germany
rise
the
drum
of
conquest
roll
in
and
and
each
time
it
be
a
krupp
who
hone
the
junker
blade
on
the
family
s
anvil
nowhere
in
american
industry
or
that
of
any
other
country
can
you
find
a
match
for
the
tie
that
have
bound
german
government
to
the
krupp
family
for
a
century
the
two
be
inseparable
partner
often
act
as
instrument
of
one
another
and
never
have
the
parallel
be
more
strike
than
in
the
appal
spring
of
when
it
appear
to
have
become
deadly
when
gustav
bought
bl
hnbach
he
never
dream
that
he
might
be
buying
a
tomb
nevertheless
thirty
one
year
later
the
lodge
become
that
to
him
for
as
the
third
reich
crumble
it
seem
that
the
country
and
the
krupp
dynasty
be
about
to
expire
together
throughout
that
extraordinary
season
the
head
of
the
house
lay
as
prostrate
as
the
nation
helpless
paralyze
in
an

it

she

in

this
be
quickly
shorten

but
the
emperor
himself
address
the

as
my

and
no
imperial

could
inject

his

a

enterprise
for

deserves
the
high
recognition
for
its
incomparable
performance
in
boost
the
military
power
of

therefore
it
be
my
wish
that
the
enterprise
be
preserve
as
a
family
property
with
his
signature
this
decree
become
a
unique
law
the

krupp
alfried
be
now
his
mother
s
sole
heir
at
the
same
time
hitler
rechristened
him
krupp
and
when
the
u
s
ninth
army
capture
essen
on
april
they
found
alfried
more
or
less
lash
to
the
mast
carry
on
as
he
have
since
when
he
become
a
sponsor
member
of
the
s
for
f
hrer
and
reich
thus
it
be
alfried
who
mount
the
dock
at
nuremberg
alfried
who
stood
trial
before
three
u
s
state
supreme
court
justice
on
charge
of
planning
aggressive
war
spoliation
of
property
in
occupy
country
and
above
all
crime
against
humanity
the
slave
labor
count
the
heart
of
the
case
he
be
acquit
of
aggression
that
the
tribunal
rule
lay
in
gustav

on
the
other
charge
he
be
found
guilty
however
and
sentence
to
twelve
year
in
prison
and
the
confiscation
of
all
his
property
so
shock
have
the
evidence
against
him
be
that
all
the
ally
east
and
west
be
determine
to
purge
europe
of
the
krupp
name
the
nightmare
have
grown
darker
and
darker
until
now
it
be
blacker
than
the
bottom
of
the
deepest

from
the

in

where
hitler
have
write
mein

two
decade
before
alfried
wore
convict
garb
to
the
family
his
imprisonment

the
most
grievous
blow
of
all
raise
to
be
a
prince
of
industrialist
he
now
lay
rust
in
jail
condemn
and
humiliate
the
krupp
have
always
be
fiercely
proud
this
burden
be
almost
insupportable
and
yet
apparently
it
have
to
be
borne
no
one
then
would
have
thought
it
possible
that
within
five
year
he
would
once
more
control
his
fortune
or
that
twenty
year
after
he
have
become
adolf
hitler
s
most
famous
industrial
prot
g
he
would
be
the
richest
man
in
europe
the
most
powerful
industrialist
in
the
common
market
even
he
himself
become
impressed
with
the
speed
of
his
recovery
at
one
time
he
have
estimate
that
it
would
take
him
fifty
year
to
clear
the
rubble
in
essen
alone
yet
he
have
never
doubt
that
redemption
would
come
or
that
he
would
be
ultimately
vindicate
after
the
nuremberg
verdict
friedrich
von
b
low
the
fellow
prisoner
who
have
direct
krupp

want
to

alfried
have
put
a
stop
to
that
he
have
say
calmly
time
will
settle
all
on
the
surface
this
seem
to
be
absurd
optimism
the
u
s
supreme
court
have
reject
an
appeal
from
his
attorney
on
august
three
week
after
the
verdict
alfried
have
write
to
general
lucius
clay
military
governor
of
west
germany
s
american
zone
ask
him
to
intervene
there
have
be
no
reply
then
the
general
have
endorse
the
finding
of
a
review
board
and
confirm
the
nuremberg
sentence
an
act
which
apparently
exhaust
the
prisoner
s
legal
remedy
yet
alfried
s
faith
be
justified
by
the
strike
parallel
between
the
krupp
saga
and
german
history
after
the
kaiser
left
a
villa
h
gel
servant
once
told
me
this
become
the
first
family
of
germany
in
some
way
the
krupp
have
a
great
claim
to
primacy
than
the
hohenzollern
and
as
the

begin
to
take
an
upward
turn
the
economic
miracle
of
the

have
begin
so
have
the
cold
war
and
nato
diplomat
want
germany
commit
to
their
side
the
devotion
of
the
conquer
people
to
the
krupp
could
hardly
be
lose
on
the
occupation
authority
in
the
early
s
a
hamburg
newspaper
editor
told
this
writer
if
i
retranslate
the
nuremberg
testimony
and

that

them
in
this
country
i

be
out
of
a
job
there
s
always
be
a
feel
here
that
other
company
make
profit
but
that
krupp
be
do
something
for
germany
that
sentiment
be
even
strong
during
alfried
s
imprisonment
when
bertha
come
to
see
her
son
during
visit
hour
the
german

treat
her
as

and
once
a
young

rush
up
and
kiss
her
hand
above
all
the
grand
alliance
which
be
form
against

need
the
power
of
the

that
meant

when
germany
prospers
krupp
prospers
in
theory
there
be
two
way
to
detour
around
him
the
first
be
nationalization
but
even
the
british
labour
government
be
against
that
the
second

propose
that
no

be
left
in
the
ruhr
at
all
the
plan

neither
workable
nor
desirable
and
there
be
no
indication
that
any
other
solution
be
seriously
consider
until
seven
month
after
the

he

off
he
couldn

somehow
he
manage
to

the
way

that

how
it

now
he

his

to
change

about

perhaps
wholesale

just

it

that

the

that

he
be
after
something
more

he
want

it

then
while
his

in

time

it
be

now
in
the
spring
of

cry
for

of

the

combine
with
the
carbon
in

of
four
thousand

to
the

who
could

this
be
the
prize
which
have
drawn
young
krupp
s
attention
others
have
be
similarly
attract
the
year
of

a

of
the
napoleonic
king

report
to
have

the
englishman
s
secret
the
follow
year
the
men
who
acquire
the
gutehoffnungsh
tte
from
friedrich
announce
that
they
be
in
possession
of
the
secret
process
and
other
claim
be
file
in
li
ge
schaffhausen
kirchspielwald
and
radevormwald
later
friedrich
s
descendant
would
vehemently
assert
that
the
honor
be
his
and
charge
that
all
other
claimant
be
fraud
really
it
be
impossible
to
choose
among
them
unriddling
the
cast
steel
process
be
meaningless
in
itself
the
trick
lay
in
first
design
a
battery
of
strong
airtight
cupola
and
then
in
so
organize
them
that
their
liquid
filling
would
pour
simultaneously
into
a
central
mold
it
be
in
short
a
matter
of
organization
and
detail
the
very
sort
of
challenge
friedrich
krupp
be
least
equip
to
meet
this
aspect
of
the
problem
be
imperfectly
understood
when
on
september
he
found
his
gusstahlfabrik
cast
steel
work
for
the
manufacture
of
english
cast
steel
and
all
article
make
thereof
the
work
first
home
be
an
annex
of
the
flachsmarkt
house
a
shed
no
large
than
a
photographer
s
darkroom
beside
and
to
the
rear
of
the
main
building
after
a
chimney
have
be
instal
there
be
scarcely
room
to
turn
around
so
inadequate
be
the
hutch
that
one
wonder
about
the
founder
s
early
intention
it
seem
incredible
that
he
even
he
really
thought
that
he
could
solve
the
great
industrial
puzzle
of
his
time
in
a
back
bedroom
possibly
he
regard
the
gusstahlfabrik
as
a
hobby
his
daily
schedule
seem
to
support
this
wholesaler
by
day
he
would
slip
into
the
shed
evening
literally
play
with
fire
with
a
more
patient
man
this
approach
might
have
make
sense
in
friedrich
s
case
there
be
certain
obvious
difficulty
if
his
pursuit
of
the
prize
money
be
serious
every
hour
away
from
his
experiment
be
an
hour
waste
furthermore
timid
wad
didn
t
fit
his
character
as
a
born
sport
he
long
to
plunge
into
deep
water
and
more
and
more
he
found
excuse
to
leave
his
desk
shed
his
cutaway
and
hurry
back
to
the
shed
finally
his
speculative
fever
have
developed
a
familiar
symptom
premonition
he
felt
sure
he
be
on
the
track
of
something
he
may
have
have
some
justification
two
month
after
his
announcement
that
he
be
in
the
steel
business
he
sign
a
contract
with
two
brother
from
wiesbaden
wilhelm
georg
ludwig
von
kechel
and
georg
karl
gottfried
von

the
kechels

prussian

officer
retire
now
and
hop
to
supplement
their
pension
they
have
stumble
across
the
information
that
cupola
be
use
in
sheffield
in
essen
they
offer
krupp
a
proposition
if
he
would
admit
them
as
partner
and
put
up
capital
they
would
provide
the
cast
steel
recipe
the
paper
be
drawn
up
sign
and
witness
and
then
the
curious
episode
of
the
elderly
brother
vanishes
in
the
mist
of
controversy

to
one
account
the

and
be
ruin
by
friedrich
s
ignorance
and
impetuosity
either
version
be
possible
yet
neither
be
entirely
satisfactory
for
each

the
wild
background
of
that

napoleonic
europe

approach
its
final
agony
essen
be
about
to
be
embattle
once
more
and
it
be
highly
doubtful
that
any
new
enterprise
could
have
flourish
in
the
alarum
and
excursion
of
for
krupp
it
be
a
twelvemonth
s
nightmare
the
first
tremor
of
upheaval
caught
him
while
he
be
busy
move
the
factory
his
new
partner
have
sensibly
point
out
that
the
shed
wouldn
t
do
even
if
he
make
big
steel
he
couldn
t
have
do
anything
with
it
shape
large
ingot
require
more
than
human
muscle
so
he
built
a
mill
on
a
family
plot
beside
a
small
essen
stream
and
join
its
waterwheel
to
a
tailhammer
with
a
pound
thrust
meanwhile
the
wholesale
business
languish
his
ignorant
wife
couldn
t
help
him
there
and
besides
she
be
pregnant
for
the
second
time
on
april
she
give
birth
to
their
first
son

with

in

with
the
new
hammer
watch
the
age
kechels
sweat
over
the
cupola
and
return
behind
the
city
wall
each
even
to
a
glum
bout
of
bookkeeping
the
young
father
blunder
through
the
autumn
to
be
charitable
friedrich
s
trouble
here
be
not
entirely
of
his
own
make
someone
have
to
take
the
first
step
toward
fine
steel
and
he
be
pay
the
penalty
of
the
pioneer
still
it
be
fair
to
point
out
that
his
motif
be
not
unselfish
he
covet
napoleon
s
gold
napoleon
and
he
have
a
remarkable
talent
for
make
a
bad
situation
bad
although
he
have
be
portrayed
to
subsequent
generation
of
german
as
a
man
of
vision
he
consistently
misread
the
sign
of
history
and
as
the
year
wan
he
make
a
stun
miscalculation
since
his
grandmother
s
death
he
have
be
waver
over
whether
to
collaborate
with
the
french
now
he
take
the
plunge
swear
allegiance
to
bonaparte
on
december
just
as
the
emperor

grande

disappear
into
the
snow
of

in

as
in
other
form
of
rapid
descent
it
be
impossible
to
stop
momentum
take
over
friedrich
s
oath

only
a
begin
he
join
the

supervise
the

of

in

home
and
loan

to
two
french
rifle

by

he
have
reach
the
dead
end
of

he
be
under

himself
as

of
the

if
this
have
a
romantic
ring
it
be
deceptive
the

be
fat
to

when

with
a
spade

such
behavior
would
have
meant
the

probably
the
scaffold

more

then
while
there

in

and
alfred
wouldn

in
a
position
to
deliver
miracle
for
quite
some
time
he

just
fourteen

nevertheless
he

an
unusual
boy
tall
and

thin
with
a
long
bony

he
have
watch
his

the
memory
of
that
broken
figure
lie
supine
in
the
stammhaus
while
everything
go

would
be
with
him
always
to
recur
vividly
in

of

in

alfred
resemble
his

his
behavior
be
closer
to
his

he

to
display
a
flamboyant
streak
and
it
be
to
be
his
good

that
unlike
him
he
live
in
an
era
in
which

possible
friedrich
believe
the
government
of

be
obligate
to

do
alfred

the

the
most
astute

moment
alfred
would
flee
home
lock
his
door
and
lie
down
sometimes
for
week
at
a
time
he
have
learn
at
his
father
s
inert
knee
that
the
bedroom
door
be
an
excellent
escape
hatch
but
although
alfred
be
his
parent
son
he
be
not
a
carbon
of
them
really
he
be
sui

a
true
maverick
restless
brilliant
imaginative
torment
farsighted
and
despite
some
rather
extraordinary
eccentricity
supremely
practical
he
come
very
close
to
that
stock
character
in
victorian
three
decker
the
mad
genius
if
he
wasn
t
demented
he
be
certainly
a
crank
even
as
an
adolescent
he
have
begin
to
display
the
odd
trait
and
phobia
which
would
later
fascinate
the
capital
of
europe
although
he
work
among
gout
of

he
be
terrify
of

him
he
believe
some
to

some
evil

in
alfred

view
be
a
particularly
enrich
odor
he
thought
its
scent
be
inspire
and
in
the
presence
of
fresh
dung
he
become
creative
unhappily
he
be
convince
that
his
own
exhalation
be
toxic
so
he
try
to
keep
on
the
move
that
be
fine
during
the
day
after
he
have
retire
it
wasn
t
so
easy
and
as
a
consequence
he
slept
badly
yet
his
chronic
insomnia
which
would
have
cripple
another
executive
actually
may
have
make
alfred
more
efficient
he
be
such
a
bundle
of
neurotic
quirk
that
they
seem
to
have
support
one
another
at
night
for
example
he

business
memoranda
a
compulsive
writer
over
thirty
thousand
of
his

to
them
his
energy
be
a
marvel
to
us
the
great
marvel
be
that
he

this
up
for
over
fifty

without

alfred

nevertheless
he

clearly
a
bright

on

when

yet
the

so
blind
to

as
krupp
thought
it
have
a
long
range
policy
cannier
than
he

since

it
his

that
he

ready
to
meet
all
cast
steel
need
of
the

a
million

nevertheless
his

on

he

like
any
other
steel
can
be
weld
with
iron
in
the
ordinary
way
at

heat
and
the
experiment
with
it
for

the

as
well
as
for

the

from
it
have
extraordinary

so
vorz

there
be
only
one
crucible
of
it
to
be
sure
but
it
be
the
real
thing
that
year
he
broke
even
for

alfred

it

the

not

splenetic
ravage

misanthropic
reading
his

watch
him
move
through

the

there

many
dead
end
so
many
false
hope

and
then
dash
that
the
aggravation
of
his
youthful
idiosyncrasy
be
hardly
surprising
summer
for
example
he
would
repeatedly
face
a
familiar
crisis
the
weather
would
be
exceptionally
dry
each
morning
he
would
rise
anxiously
creep
down
from

back
at
the

and
then
inspect
the

obviously
it

those

a

they

when

the

the

revolution
they

in

where
their

to

have
just
taught
german

how
to

it

still
have
a
few
secret
squirreled
away
and
if
the
only
way
to

them
be
to
go
there
then
nach

first
nach
paris
alien
though
the
british
might
be
they
be
nevertheless
racial
cousin
of
the
german
and
therefore
likely
to
be
wily
it
be
well
to
train
a
bit
before
cross
the
channel
the
french
be
less
spartan
they
be
self
indulgent
oversexed
one
still
heard
whisper
story
about
the
grande
arm
e

occupation
and
notoriously
fond
of
deck
out
their
bawdy
woman
with
expensive
trinket
the
paris
barnyard
in
short
be
certain
to
be
eager
for
sch
ne
roller
on
depart
from
essen
this
be
a
normal
attitude
for
alfred
the
singular
thing
be
that
he
left
paris
with
the
very
same
impression
the
boulevard
the
arch
the
cathedral
the
enchantment
of
europe
s
most
magnificent
city
didn
t
touch
him
at
all
he
didn
t
dislike
it
it
simply
wasn
t
there
for
him
travel
couldn
t
broaden
him
because
he
be
incapable
of
be
broaden
the
businesslike
report
of
his
salesman
be
confirm
and
that
be
all
that
interested
him
thus
his
letter
tell
almost
nothing
of
france
as
usual
however
they
reveal
a
great
deal
about
himself
now
in
fine
copperplate
now
in
a
hasty
scrawl
he
informs
the
family
that
he
be
out
there
hustle
god
willing
he
writes
on
july
i
shall
get

what

do
here
there
will

the

now
i
shall
add
the

of
the

together
with

and
then
close
for
it
be
half

and
i

not
stood
up
from

later
in

and
that
if
i
be
not
absolutely
oblige

go
to
england
for
much
great
advantage
i
could
easily
get
order
for
time
as
much
as
up
to
now
a
krupp
travelogue
follow
paris
be
the
sort
of
place
where
a
skilled
salesman
can
find
something
to
do
year
in
year
out
in
all
the
kind
of
thing
we
make
then
back
to
business
in
the
remain
day
of
july
i
shall
make
a
sketch
of
a
machine
that
will
perhaps
cost
to

i
be
also
think
about

now
as
i
have
be

it

as
i
generally
go
out
at

just

i
be

over
this
or
this
morning
i
make
a
sketch
of
a

to
lay
before
a
certain
man
i
be
not

i
be
just
go

this
be
hyperbole
he
wouldn
t
have
do
anything
of
the
sort
instead
he
would
merely
have
collapse
groan
until
the
alarmed
h
telier
summon
a
physician
one
sketch
be
reject
and
the
dreadful
consequence

to

that

alfred

concerned
about

honesty
no

can
sneak
away
with
a

even

cut
deeper
it
touch
one
of
his
most
terrible
fear
how
easily
a
fire
can
break
out
you
know
and
a
fire
would
destroy
everything
everything

that

still
there
alfred

and
there
his
performance
go
beyond
the
bizarre
it
becomes
quite
incredible
there
be
something
almost
chaplinesque
about
his
british
adventure
reading
the
correspondence
one
half
expect

to

but
let
alfred

only
yesterday
at
a

without

a

for

i
be

the

be
flatter
that
a

should
deign

but
have
the
expedition
really
be
successful
in
reality
it
have
be
a
farce
all
alfred
have
learn
be
that
good
steel
come
from
fine
workmanship
and
good
iron
or
as
he
put
it
underscore
the
line
we
shall
never
get
from
bruninghaus
the
iron
to
make
the
kind
of
steel
that
be
satisfactory
for
edge
tool
very
true
but
he
didn
t
have
to
go
to
sheffield
to
find
that
out
as
hermann
knew
that
be
why
they
have
be
try
to
get
swedish
ore
and
the
stratagem
be
pointless
anyhow
in
planning
it
alfred
have
be
set
his
sight
on
the
midland
of
a
generation
ago
the
bogey
that
have
kill
friedrich
krupp
by
the
late
s
the
huntsman
principle
be
know
everywhere
the
english
be
aware
of
that
and
if
their
visitor
have
come
to
them
decently
they
would
doubtless
have
told
him
a
great
deal
more
than
he
heard
in
masquerade
j
a
henckel
who
found
a
ruhr
factory
at
solingen
be
stop
in
sheffield
at
the
same
time
henckel
introduce
himself
as
himself
and
no
one
clam
up
he
write

that
he
be
free
to
tour
all
mill
from
ten
o
clock
in
the
morning
until
ten
at
night
moreover
if
the
british
have
want
to
keep
krupp
out
alfred
s
mummery
wouldn
t
have
save
him
because
it
couldn
t
possibly
have
deceive
anyone
in

themselves
as
gentry
he
and
s
lling
toil
under
an
obvious
handicap
neither
spoke
english
discover
this
to
be
awkward
alfred
take
a
crash
course
in
the
language
meanwhile
embellish
his
counterfeit
story
with
an
account
of
a
continental
childhood
and
feign
a
dark
slavic
look
he
still
wouldn
t
admit
the
truth
to
englishman
though
that
winter
in
liverpool
he
become
acquaint
with
a
prussian
diplomat
hermann
von
mumm
who
later
described
him
in
his
memoir
as
quite
young
very
tall
and
slim
look
delicate
but
good
look
and
attractive
one
day
alfred
drew
mumm
aside
and
confide
that
he
be

under
an

this

the
viennese
stick
tight
to
the

shape
of

refuse

rather
spitefully
alfred

on
this
account
some
people
consider
the

intensely
he

at

they

assure

the
lesson
he

one

regret
that

something
more
appropriate

it
be
to
remain
where
it
be
a
monument
to
his

the

of
artistic
lunacy
except
that
late
in

alfred
be
to

how
wild
an

he
could
be
when
he
really
put

nevertheless
the

certainly
no
one
suspect
that
berlin
would
become
the

of
the
great
aggressive

that
its

provoke
three

soak
european

with
the

of

generation
military

be
inconceivable
without

politically

neither

have
degenerate
into
a
bewildering
jigsaw
puzzle
its
resurgence
appear
as
improbable
as
a

would
now
napoleon

to

most
memorably
the
great
question
of

sat
around

that
the

when

what
a

just
how

until
several
year
later
when
the

alfred
perhaps
remember
his

when

at
the

of

that
he
find
some
other
person
more
suitable
for
the

alfred
s
relationship
with

to
improve
until
he
be
virtually
a

he
would
continue
to
have
his
giddy
ups

sicken
down
that
be
in
the
nature
of
both
the

and
the
industrial

and
possibly
it
be
also
characteristic
of

henceforth

it

perhaps
of

not
even

it
each

to
grasp
the
new
historic
meaning
which
the

now
assume
henceforth
krupp
would
be
identify
with
the

aspiration
of
the

because
of
the
favor
grant
him
and
his
heir
they
would
become

the
fact
that
he
continued
to
manufacture

quite
beside

krupp

success
with

production
be
a
direct
consequence
of
his
military
production
if
he
hadn
t
make
cannon
he
wouldn
t
have
become
a
national
institution
and
it
be
the
institutionalize
of
the
krupp
which
give
them
their

wilhelm
would
never

alfred

krupp

the
source

his

very
well
in
a

he
would
come

this
put

that

to

now
make
itself

for
the
introduction
of
a

with

be
spent
fortify
the

this
be
no
time

his

if

he

learn
in

with

and
beg
the
young

to
follow
the

it
be
absurd
to

that

it
would

krupp
conclude
with
an
appeal
in
behalf
of
his
own
future
and
that
of

i
must
make
certain
that
the

of

continue
to

a
credit
to
me

to

whether

should
trouble
your

pleasant

i
have
be
consider
the

the

by

i
have
read
your

as
you
authorize
me
to
make
official
use
of
it
i
have
make
a
few
remark
on
it
and
sent
it
to
albedyll
herr

in
so
do
your

have
met
an
urgent
desire
of
mine
in
the
hope
that
something
of
the
sort
might
have
happen
i
brought
a
second
copy
of
the
denkschrift
for
your

i
do
not
want
anything
but
justice
and
fair
deal
but
i
must
fight
the
matter
through
however
much
it
may
cost
me
even
if
it
cost
me
my
head
s
m
go
into
some
of
the
point
in
the
denkschrift
remark
from
time
to
time
i
have
say
so
myself
herr
krupp
not
long
ago
major
trautmann
ask
general
von
voigts
rhetz
straight
out
what
be
it
exactly
that
they
have
against
the
work
instead
of
give
a
plain
answer
v
v
r
threaten
that
the
time
might
come
when
the
work
might
be
forbidden
to
export
your
majesty
it
be
surely
in
the
best
interest
of
the
state
that
there
should
be
friendly
relation
between
the
work
and
the
state
i
have
make
provision
for
insure
that
the
work
shall
continue
to
remain
in
the
future
in
the
hand
of
my
family
i
have
bought
mine
for
ninety
nine
year
in
the
hope
that
this
will
be
so
for
at
least
that
period
but
when
view
of
this
sort
be
held
and
that
by
the
man
who
be
suppose
to
be
our
next
war
minister
at
this
s
m
be
greatly
take
aback
how
can
that
be
hop
for
i
be
not
conscious
of
have
give
offense
to
general
von
voigts
rhetz
of
all
men
i
should
have
expect
that
he
would
have
inherit
a
friendly
feel
from
his
brother
at
the
present
the
work
be
too
weak
to
absorb
oppressive
measure
what
they
want
be
help
extract
from
the
account
be
then
place
before
s
m
who
retain
them
i
do
not
want
to
get
away
without
speak
about
the
minister
of

the
more
i
hear
of
him
the
more
i
be
convince
that
he
be
a
man
of
sterling
uprightness
if
injustice
be
do
therefore
it
cannot
be
his
fault
it
be
impossible
for
him
to

acquaint
with

detail
the

lie
with
the
small
men

make
inaccurate
representation
to
him
s
m
agree
altogether
with
this
view
herr

the
matter
must
be
decide
now
one
way
or
the
other
i
shall
be
stay
here
in

your

may
infer
from
some
thing
he
say
about
you

your
good
work
that
you
will
not
lack

support
which
you
have

from
the

it
be
all
over

the

arose
in
an
unexpected
quarter
krupp

that
so

at

it

prejudice
against

be
notoriously
an
admirer
of
british
ordnance
i
have
since
enjoy
its
unvarying
recognition
and
confidence
he
spoke
prematurely
he
have
scarcely
receive
the
soldier

the

the

one
possibility
have
be
overlook
suppose
the
good
he
sell
prove
to
be
worthless
under
the
exact
gross
that
be
suppose
to
be
impossible
nevertheless
it
happen
the

these

a

it
would
be
even
sadder
if
britain

germany
whom
he
assume
would

lack
ingenious

therefore
he

at

they
steam

circle

at

on

as

he
could

for
an
audit
of
his

in
the

of
the

unfortunately
the

an

what

the

revolutionize

at
the

to
provide

the
more
difficult
its
solution
appear
to
be
the
great
the
achievement
suppose
we
examine
a

aspect

the

on
the

it
may
be

the

ship
have
shot
in

be
fatal
to
her
therefore
though
we
lose

the
foe
loses
his

if
we
have
towed
our
island

far
that
we
prevent

that

even

should

he

in

of

the

he

that
would
have
brought
an

with

the
effect
be
the

be
the

maybe
it

it
be
very
hard

i
notice
with
great
pleasure
that
in
the

you
sent
me
you
already
look
strong
than
you
ever
do
before
in
the
snapshot
the
boy
look
anything
but
well
nor
be
he
he
suffer
constant
pain
and
be
in
no
condition
to
work
all
the
same
that
be
what
his
old
man
have
in
mind
alfred
have
never
forgotten
that
his
first
cannon
sale
have
be
to
khedive
say
of
egypt
now
say
s
nephew
ismail
sat
on
the
throne
surely
there
must
be
some
business
there
to
be
picked
up
on
new
year
s
eve
his
eye
lit
upon
a
newspaper
paragraph
earlier
in
the
year
ismail
have
annexed
the
sudanese
province
of
darfur
now
there
be
speculation
that
the
egyptian
might
build
a
railroad
there
it
be
nonsense
the
khedive
be
so
bankrupt
that
in
less
than
a
year
he
would
be
oblige
to
sell
his
suez
canal
share
to
the
british
but
alfred
seize
upon
the
item
dispatch
his
constantinople
agent
to
cairo
and
telegraph
fritz
instruction
to
open

talk
that
even
he
write
him
i
be
prepared
to
undertake
the
whole
railway
to
darfur
die
ganze
bahn

include
all
the
earthwork
therefore
you
may
go
directly
to
talk
to
such
people
as
may
be
interested
in
the
scheme
and
have
notion
of
their
own
about
it

this
have
a
strong
flavor
of
busywork
alfred
admit
as
much
it
be
possible
of
course
that
the
report
be
baseless
and
that
there
be
no
question
at
present
of
any
such
work
that
the
report
be
only
correct
in
part
or
not
at
all
even
in
that
case
none
of
the
brainwork
or

will
have
be
waste

a
similar
case
will
turn
up
later
and
we
shall
have
thought
it
through
in
advance
and
can
exploit
our
present
conclusion
it
be
improbable
this
case
as
alfred
conceive
it
do
not
exist
the
astonish
fact
be
that
he
have
no
idea
where
the
sudan
be
he
thought
it
must
be
somewhere
in
the
middle
east
next
morning
he
mail
fritz
another
letter
explain
that
the
contract
appeal
to

greet
the
new
century
appropriately
with
a
thunderous
display
of
firework
from
the

it
of
the
retribution
which

ahead
on

two

would
live
to
see
the
grim
sequel

aboard
one

and
the
snapshot
barbara
have
preserve
from
those

provide
a
clue
to
what
the
girl
be
like
they
look
small
dark
fragile
and
painfully
vulnerable
in
their
heart

the
wide
eye
peer
out
beneath
bonnet
one
perceives
the
cameo
innocence
of
very
privileged
child
in
a
very
shelter
time
doubtless
they
be
merely
bemuse
by
the

across
two

a
century
of
brutality

and
bad
and
it
be
hard
to
gaze
back
the
bad
for
them
come
in
these
tender
year
they
be
about
to
become
the
victim
of
their
father
s
misconduct
or
if
one
believe
that
all
form
of
sexual
behavior
be
equally
acceptable
of
a
society
which
take
a
different

now
come
the

this
tastelessness

by
the

even
today
the

however
in

they

the

medicine
be
an
inexact

nevertheless
it
be
astonish

read
their

that

cannot
grow

while
there
be
still

in

indeed
the
medical
imprecision
of
this
document
shortness
of
breath
and
a
slow
heartbeat
be
described
as
the
symptom
which
lead
the

to
believe
krupp
have
be
the
victim
of
a
stroke
together
with
its
general
vagueness
suggests
that
it
may
have
be
drawn
up
by
someone
else
whatever
the
doctor
have
see
in
fritz

they
be
the

he

though

make
him
one
of

which
tilo

the

if

the

history
might
read
rather
differently
it
be
worth

that
his

he
do
mutter

i
quite
see
now
that
we

the

i
will
expect
you

he

that
the

might
save
the

he
still
hadn
t
abandon
the
hope
of
a
satisfactory
solution
in
the

wilhelm
be
dream
but
he
be
a
hardheaded
realist
compare
to

of
a
german
writer
gustav
suffer
from
an
inability
ever
to
admit
that
the

he
therefore
put
up
shutter
on
his
mind
which
blind
him
to
what

really
go
on
accord
to
his
calculation
ludendorff
be
about
to
triumph
at
any
moment
the

have
defeat
the

a

that
persists

even

what

its

originally

he

they

therefore
before

down
they
would
resume

thus
it

rush
to

the
french
timing
strongly
suggests
that
this
be
meant
to
be
no
more
than
a
gesture
that

be
expect

stay
out
of
the
ruhr
expatriate
he
could
have
be
traduce
as

indeed
certain
question
ask
of
him
after
his

may
suggest
that
he
have
be
marked
as
a
scapegoat
on
the
third
day
of
his
trial
an
officer
angrily
demand
why
he
have
come

hadn

gustav
nod
shortly
and
answer
my
absence
might
be
construe
as
incriminate
my

or
as
evidence
of
a
guilty
conscience
on
my
own
part
why
then
he
be
ask
hadn
t
he
insist
that
the
other
two
join
him
accord
to
the

he
reply
i
be
ready
enough
to
go

myself
even
though
i

i

it

possible
that

krupp

the

he
be
confound
by
the

but
he
be
a
crafty
tactician
it
should
be
add
that
his

there

which
would
later

that
change
the

emerge
with

second
only
to

now
they
have
to

they
have
popular
support
include
the
allegiance
of
every
non
communist
hoodlum
in
the
country
in
the
spring
campaign
of
when

unsuccessfully
challenged
hindenburg

his
storm
trooper
smash
the

own

and
beat
up
social

indiscriminately
in

and
this

they

more
than
any

all
that

thus
the

while
the

surge
to
the
poll
again

again
unable

resolve
the
issue
krupp
found
this
very
confuse
with
his
reverence
for
chief
of

he
have
continued
to
mail
submissive
letter
to

although
he
agree
with
his
fellow
industrialist
that
weimar
be
a
zwischenreich
a
temporary
regime
he
have
stalk
indignantly
from
a
meeting
when
one
of
them
refer
to
former

ebert
as
that
saddlemaker
gustav
want

he
ask
only
that
he
be
give
firm
leadership
lack
that
yearn
for
a
return
to

he
conclude
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
big
change
grosser
umschwung
his
position
and
the
eminent
name
he
bore
meant
that
any
new
leader
would
encounter
rough
sled
without
his
active
support
aware
of
this
responsibility
he
hesitate
while
others
leap
as
early
as
carl

have
call
for
the

now
duisberg
have
found
his

youth
be

i
be
too
old
some
of
krupp
s
reservation
be
snobbish
like
bertha
he
saw
hitler
as
an
upstart
both
of

s
formal
introduction
to
wilhelm
ii
though
the
f

ordinarily
disliked
any
reminder
of
his
early
life
this
clearly
delighted
him
he
dance
a
little
jig
and
then
in
that
effeminate
way
he
have
cocked
his
left
wrist
against
his
cant
hip
and
extend
a
limp
hand
gustav
didn
t
allow
himself
to
smile
often
but
this
time
he
giggle
in
the
blur

he
look
like
a
rejuvenate
old
dwarf
the
impression
of
alfried
be
very
different
tall
and
somber
clothed
in
a
tight
sheath
of
what
his
s
extol
as
sachlichkeit
objectivity
he
bow
gravely
and
thumped
his
heel
to
define
now
the
precise
relationship
between
altendorferstrasse
and
wilhelmstrasse
in
the
s
be
difficult
since
the
war
an
entire
generation
of
german
have
be
taught
that
gustav
have
become
a
helpless
victim
of
event
who
now
merely
act
as
the
executive
organ
of
a
will
that
knew
no
bound
whose
only
alternative
be
to
flee
the
reich
and
who
couldn
t
do
that

there

no

be
more
complicate
than
that
there

the

of
alfried

bertha
who
after
all

despite
her
conviction
that
she
be
superior
to
the

retain
her
intense
patriotism

of

a

assume
that
the
tension
between
the
two

arose
from
a

a
struggle
for
the

that
have
already
begin
to

from

alfried

his

there
be
actually
a

case
the

the

i
myself

exert
no

on

probably

not

then
until
about
to

i
realize
that
in

it

with

those

have

he
would

he
could

paradoxically
l

lay

the
f

vetoed
the

he
have
give
no
reason

he
have

an
excellent

goerdeler
have

resign
the

against

when

that
he
have
to
withdraw
his

goerdeler
have
suavely
told
him
to
forget
about
it
he
have
other
plan
anyhow
have
he
go
into
detail
gustav
as
a

would
have
be
compel

he

this
be
the

he

get

the

understandable
no

the

he
remain
aloof
from

or
for
the
suppression
of

it

small
consequence
his

s
in
clearly
put
him
in
the
vanguard
of

equally
clear
he
be
proud
of
his
status
as
an
old

he
continued
his
contribution
to

until
the
outbreak
of
the

when
his
branch
of

fly
corp
claus
s
enthusiasm
for
aviation
have
become
infectious
but
alfried
spurn
the
luftwaffe
and
chose
a
party
squadron
he
be
good
too
in

he
rise
from

yet
he
didn
t
look
the
part
to
be
sure
there
be
a
strong
physical
resemblance
between
himself
and
the
great
krupp
like
alfred
alfried
be
distinguish
by
a
narrow
head
high
brow
hawklike
nose
sunken
cheek
a
sardonic
mouth
and
a
long
lean
face
the
two
be
alike
in
other
way
too
shy
lonely
uneasy
each
with
the
same
lock
mind
but
in
some
respect
we
know
alfred
well
because
he
be
such
a
compulsive
writer
alfried
rarely
commit
an
unnecessary
word
to
paper
and
though
his
support
of
nazi
cause
lead
one
to
expect
a
certain
stance
something
like
the
icy
stare
and
outthrust
chin
of
otto
skorzeny
another
of
alfried
s
contemporary
in

it
wasn
t
there
he
have
no
duel
scar
no
monocle
he
seldom
clicked
his
heel
and
never
shave
his
head
indeed
much
of
the
time
he
need
a
haircut
his
handshake
be
spongy
and
his
manner
with
stranger
wistful
anxious
wary
he
smile
tightly
just
crimp
the
corner
of
his
mouth
and
scarcely
move
his
rather
pendulous
low
lip
most
surprising
of
all
be
his
eye
they
be
flat
and
fade

they

him
in
the
home
of
a
mutual

and
comment
afterward
that
alfried
be
the
very
opposite
of
his
concept
of
a
prussian
tycoon
in
reality
alfried
s
understated
impersonal
manner
be
more
british
than
prussian
that
be
not
entirely
illogical
the

alfried
might
have
be
an
unemployed
english
actor
say
or
an
eccentric
midland
bookkeeper
he
didn

look
like

something
be
lack
a
certain
buoyancy
a
sense
of
assurance

he
be
fat
never

it
this
be
puzzle
for
his
subsequent
achievement
outstrip
in
some
respect
those
of
alfred
be
to
argue
the
presence
of
these
very
trait

indeed
the
closer
one
examines

the

the

contradiction

there

gustav

elsewhere
fortunately
the

it

among

thing
in

alfried
could
not
afterward
argue
as

do
that

have

give
the
option
of

that

do

accord
to
the

first

suggest
by
alfried
on
february
in

saur
try
to
table
it
to
bypass
this
opposition
von
bohlen
as
he
be
still
know
then
go
directly
to
hitler
on
august
saur
speer
and
alfried
met
in
hitler
s
office
with
the
other
two
leader
of
the
rve
rohland
and
r
chling
at
the
conclusion
of
this
meeting
saur
told
the
nuremberg
tribunal
mr
von
bohlen
go
to
see
hitler
and
together
with
speer
come
from
hitler
s
headquarters
to
the
park
area
of
rastenburg
where
i
be
walk
around
with
various
other
gentleman
speer
approach
me
in
the
presence
of
mr
von

and
inform
me
of
the
order
that
hitler
have
now
definitely
issue
that
the
construction
have
to
be
carry
out
and
that
we
have
to
give
him
all
the
help
the
need
i
have
to
conclude
that
this
be
an
explicit
order
from
hitler
which
we
have
to
follow
ask
by
the
tribunal
why
the
f
hrer
have
intervene
saur
explain
that
hitler
himself
have
a
great
admiration
and
weakness
for
the
name
krupp
and
the
family
krupp
as
such
because
to
repeat
his
own
word
that
be
the
weapon
forge
for
all
germany
the
witness
add
that
the
relationship
between
krupp
and
ourselves
be
different
from
our
relationship
with
other
firm
because
of
the
unique
position
which
krupp
held
i
would
like
to
quote
another
example
for
instance
the
hermann
g
ring
work
be
in
a
similar
position
after
alfried
s
conviction
as
a

publish
a
bitter

that
he
have
be
designate
in
hitler
s
will
as
speer

successor
nachfolger
and
that
saur
have
create
an
insupportable
atmosphere
in
the
german
economy
with
his
boorish
manner
the
baron
accuse
saur
of
be
a
racist
and
charge
that
his
bigotry
have
won
approval
among
american
the
fact
that
he
once
use
the

their
subsequent
correspondence
reveals
that
bormann
carefully
study
this
letter
the
full
text
of
which
include
a
hodgepodge
of
gustavian
thought
although
he
be
aware
that
his
kruppianers
social
welfare
will
be
take
care
of
by
the
party
and
the
state
more
and
more
in
the
future
he
believe
that
the
people
who
work
for
him
be
entitle
to
add
inducement
for
promotion
of
intellectual
and
technical
talent
and
a
far
social
claim
to
which
especially
the
worker
of
krupp
be
entitle
he
be
think
of
establish
a
kind
of
company
own
training
place
for
craftsman
modestly
he
propose
that
the
name
gustav
haus
shall
serve
this
idea
in
the
wide
sense
of
the
word
there
be
more
of
this
sort
of
thing
but
bormann
saw
through
it
to
the
kernel
which
be
very
hard
something
have
to
be
do
for
alfried
and
fast
on
consider
this
question
we
have
ascertain
that
under
the
present
law
the
principal
solution
of
the
question
cannot
be
carry
out
we
have
to
find
an
entirely
new
way
create
new
legislation
what
the
old
krupp
want
be
an
absolute
industrial
monarchy
he
insist
that
the
reich
recognize
the
existence
of
the
family
s
autonomous
staat
im
staate
rule
by
an
independent
konzernherr
this
be
something
more
than
the
protection
of
the
firm
s
efficiency
the
preservation
of
a
legacy
and
tax
exemption
it
be
an
entirely
new
concept
repeal
a
long
roll
of
statute
which
have
begin
with
the
inception
of
the
industrial
revolution
nevertheless
hitler
approve
in
his
harsh
inimitable
voice
he
told
bormann
jawohl
however
there
must
be
no
nonsense
about
fresh
legislation
for
all
businessmen
that
would
open
a
pandora
s
box
everyone
in
the
government
would
be
busy
turn
down
claim
and
there
would
be
no
time
left
to
fight
the
war
they
might
as
well
call
a
spade
a
spade
this
be
to
be
one
law
for
one
family
exempt
it
from
the
reich
minister
for
justice
economics
and
finance
if
their
advice
be
sought
they
would
naturally
protest
therefore
they
would
be
told
nothing
this
unique
privilege
be
be
grant
because
of
the
krupp
dynasty
s
long
history
of
loyalty
to
the
aspiration
of
german
militarism

in

the

this

in

the
legal
basis
for
his
postwar

in
the
opinion
of

the
reason
the
prisoner
of

become
so
restive
be
that
in

there
be

they

with

then
alfried

we

the

naturally
how

compete

he
do
load
the

as
early
as

the

in

mr

at

they

the

alfried

concede
that
he

at
the

that

starve
the
fact
that
complaint
be
frequently
make
on
account
of
insufficient
food
for
the
foreign
worker
be
well
remember
by
me
he
blame
technical
difficulty
and
the
official
regulation
which
determine
the
ration
in
detail
they
do
indeed
and
they
be
sensible
as
of
february
russian
and
pole
who
have
be
draft

suppose
to

a

the
figure
for
those
engage
in

be
in
very
heavy
work
yet
what
be
happen
at
krupp
during
those
month
on
march
the
supervisor
of
a
tool
shop
complain
that
the
food
of
the
russian
work
here
be
so
pitifully
bad
that
they
be
get
weaker
and
weaker
every
day
investigation
have
show
for
example
that
some
russian
be
not
strong
enough
to
tighten
a
turn
part
sufficiently
for
the
lack
of
physical
strength
condition
be
exactly
the
same
at
all
other
place
where
russian
be
employ
if
care
be
not
take
to
change
the
feed
arrangement
sufficiently
so
that
a
normal
output
may
be
expect
from
these
men
then
their
employment
and
all
the
expense
connect
with
it
will
have
be
in
vain
elsewhere
in
the
konzern
condition
be
the
same
four
day
later
one
krupp
foreman
write
another
foreman
describe
a
daily
visit
by
oberlagerf
hrung
chef
what
these
men
call
a
day
s
ration
be
a
complete
puzzle
to
me
the
food
be
a
puzzle
too
because
they
ladle
out
the
thinnest
of
already
watery
soup
it
be
literally
water
with
a
handful
of
turnip
and
it
look
like
dish
water
the
people
have
to
work
for
us
good
but
care
must
be
take
to
see
that
they
get
at
least
the
bare
necessity
i
have
see
a
few
figure
in
the
camp
and
a
cold
shudder
actually
ran
up
and
down
my
spine
i
met
one
there
and
he
look
as
though
he
d
get
barber
s
rash
if
this
continue
we
shall
all
be
contaminate
it
be
a
pity
when
just
at
this
moment
the
motto
be
increase
production
something
must
be
do
to
keep
the
people
capable
of
production
nothing
be
do
eight

later

they

generally
weak
physical
condition
to
of
the
russian
here
be
absent
daily
on
account
of
illness
the
reason
why
the
russian
be
not
capable
of
production
be
in
my
opinion
that
the
food
which
they
be
give
will
never
give
them
the
strength
for
work
which
you
hope
for
the
food
one
day
for
instance
consist
of
a
watery
soup
with
cabbage

and
a
few

then

at
this
point
rohlfs

self
assurance
waver
and
he
reply
i
be
afraid
i
can
t
say
that
we
be
successful
in
reduce
the
rate
of
illness
in
the
case
of
the
russian
to
such
an
extent
that
the
percentage
of
illness
fluctuate
around
percent
the
american
close
in
q
how
many
case
of

do
you
have
a
i
m
afraid
i
can
t
give
you
any
figure
for
that
because
of
extreme
weakness
and
exhaustion
many
of
them
die
q
be
it
therefore
correct
to
assume
that
part
of
this
reduction
of
illness
in
the
case
of
russian
prisoner
of

might
also
be

by
death
a
yes
of
course
of
course
since
they
have
die
a
natural
death
the
doctor
saw
nothing
odd
in
his
reduction
of

to

by
neglect
to
distinguish
between

he
get
out
with
a

two
fellow

enter

out
of

hit
the

and
sprang
to
attention
we
all
realize
it

no

even
now
he

off
at

the

his

tad
be

from

in

have
reduce
the
others
to

it
be
unlikely
that
he
would
even
recognize

and
since
he
know
no
other

there
be
no

among

a

crisscross
in

unlike
tad
they
testify
at
nurenberg
and
since
their
story
be
mutually
supportive
they
make
a
strong
impression
upon
the
tribunal
in
january
hendrik

a
nineteen

by
his

but
he
be
fully
aware

there

most
of

with
several
inch
of

because

uneven
there
be
a

the

less
than

nevertheless
they

a
ghastly
fight
broke
out
for
these
precious
patch
it
be
to
recur
each
night
and
scholtens
heard

for

in

thin
clothing
they

march
back
into

to
repair

damage
it
hardly
seem
worth
the

they

and
the
hike
back
require
another
four
hour
under
such
a
regimen
saur
s
calorie
scarcely
seem
excessive
yet
when
food
appear
that
even
for
the
first
time
in
two
day
it
be
the
familiar
bowl
of
warm
water
with
cabbage
leaf
accompany
by
a
single
slice
of
black
bread
once
a

old

told
scholtens
they
would
also
receive
a
smear
of
margarine
a
smear
of
jam
and
a
small
sausage
he
knew
that
wouldn
t
be
enough
one
veteran
suggest
to
him
that
he
search
neerfeldschule
s
straw
pallet
for
mouse
however
horrible
this
will
be
the
only
fresh
food
you
will
be
able
to
get
hold
of
the
student
thought
he
must
be
joking
yet
as
the
nocturnal
chaos
be
repeat
again
and
again
with
filthy
prisoner
brawling
in
the
dark
over
a
few
foot
of
dry
floor
and
sick
prisoner
double
up
in
the
water
fight
cramp
use
of
the
toilet
be
forbidden
until
dawn
the
revolt
advice
seem
less
disgust
obviously
scholtens
wasn
t
go
to
last
long
this
way
he
could
see
what
be
happen
to
weaker
men
when
there
be
enough
sick
people
they
be
put
on
a
truck
till
the
floor
of
the
truck
be
cover
they
vanished
from
the
camp
and
i
never
saw
them
again
the
youth
be
determine
to
avoid
that
sort
of
exit
at
all
cost
so
he
and
another
dutchman
begin
stalk
mouse
in
earnest
finally
they
found
one
at
nuremberg
these
little
episode
appear
to
disturb
the
defense
far
more
than
the
large
implication
the
disappearance
of
the
ill
men
under
cross
examination
an
incredulous
krupp
lawyer
challenged
scholtens
s
account
of
what
the
attorney
call
this
particularly
unsavory
incident
q
can
you
describe
in
detail
how
you
caught
the
mouse
a
yes
we
be
terribly
hungry
in
those
day
we
become
a
little
bit
crazy
so
to
speak
and
be
look
for
anything
that
could
be
eat
and
we
saw
other
prisoner
eat
and
just
see
one
chew
make
us
more
hungry
for
something
and
they
say
well
you
can
eat
it
too
well
there
be
lot
of
those
mouse
in
the
straw
bed
and
my
friend
and
i
we
get
one
and
although
we
didn
t
eat
it
with
appetite
we
do
try
to
q
you
caught
the
mouse
with
your
own
hand
a
yes
of
course
i
do
q
and
on
the
follow
day
as
you
say
you
cooked
it
in
the
factory
a
yes
q
do
you
have
the
possibility
of
so
do
a
yes
near
the
work
we
found
some
wood
and
we
make
a
fire
sometimes
we
be
allow
to
make
a
fire
when
it
be
terribly
cold
and
in
the
iron
saucepan
which
we
always
carry
with
us
when
there
be
something
to
put
in
it
we
so
to
say
fry
it
in
order
not
to
eat
it
raw
q
i
d
like
to
ask
one
more
question
on
this
subject
a
mouse
have
a
skin
do
you
skin
the
mouse
before
you
cooked
it
a
of
course
we
ate
only
the
meat
q
do
you
have
tool
to
do
that
a
well
not
tool
but
piece
of
glass
and
little
iron
piece
we
could
always
find
around
the
ground
the
lawyer
move
on
which
be
too
bad
for
the
issue
wasn
t
really
resolve
mouse
meat
be
largely
protein
scholtens
s
share
of
the
catch
could
hardly
have
kept
him
go
long
nor
do
it
six
week
after
his
arrival
in
essen
he
become
feverish
faint
and
awoke
with
double
pneumonia
the
truck
look
unavoidable
now
but
he
be
save
by
a
bureaucratic
freak
scholtens
be
an
escapee
legally
he
be
a
messerschmitt
slave
krupp
couldn
t
dispose
of
another
industrialist
s

therefore
the
fever

student
whose

have
drop
to
ninety
seven
pound
be
transfer
via
a

heidelberg
to

he
slowly
recover

the

and
the

indeed
they
didn
t
even
meet
him
until
after
the
liberation
of

what
tie
his
life
to
theirs
be
neerfeldschule
where
they
be

that
autumn
after

a
common
ability
to
identify
the

who
have
mistreat
them
there
it
be
precisely
this
sort
of
corroboration
the
fitting
together
of

of
tiny

he

that

the

the

awkward

would
be
the
discovery
that

because

success
when
rolf

suggest
in

that
if
the

the

have
not
invoked

an
indignant
krupp
executive
told
this
writer
that
the
playwright
have
turn
an
act
of
generosity
into
a
monstrosity
that
bertha
krupp
built
the
quarter
with
the
guidance
of
the
red
cross
for
homeless
orphan
bertha
and
the
red

have
nothing
to
do
with
it
the
inmate
be
not
orphan
and
hochhuth
have
only
graze
the
truth
yet
few
than
a
dozen
people
knew
it
and
they
be
keep
very
quiet
their
silence
go
unchallenged
partly
because
the
fact
be
so
incredible
partly
because
the
infant
far
from
be
near
essen
have
be
twenty
six
mile
away
and
chiefly
because
there
be
no
know
survivor
indeed
krupp
be
so
confident
that
buschmannshof
would
be
forgotten
that
its
building
weren
t
even
torn
down
today
they
still
stand
seven
long
low
dingy
barrack
with
small
window
indistinguishable
at
first
glance
from
the

of

there
be
a

discipline
be
never

it
be
also
call
the
old
prisoner
be
two
year
old
and
all
be
extremely
weak
therefore
there
be
no
barbwire

and
a
visitor
familiar
with
the

of

anyone

up
a

with
these

he
inquire
about
the

learn
that
as
soon
as

week
she
go
back

the

be
kept
in

so
that
the

again
next
as
he
testify
i
ask
them
how
it
come
about
that
these

be
so
undernourished
and
i
be
told
they

very
little

even

surprised
that
we
get
such
good
food
back
with
the
ukrainian

the
ex

wonder
how

bitterly
all
the

three

that
fifty

sixty
child
die
every

and
as
many
be
born
every

because
there
be
a
constant
influx
of
eastern
female
worker
with

really
inquisitive
now
their
visitor
press
them
for
detail
i
ask
the

he
recall
on
the
witness
stand
how
it
come
about
that
so
many
of
the

die
and
if
the

be

and
the

told
me
the

for

at
night
marquardt

recollection
be

we

certainly
hang

marquardt
go

he
maintain
that
they
told

they
be
glad
to

quite
like
it
at

all
this
be
unlikely
their
discovery
of

have
be
fortuitous
there
be
no
reason
to
believe
that
either

be

the

have
no
memory

while
they
be
doubtless
glad
to

see
the

of

it
be
inconceivable
that
they
would
have
voluntarily
endorse
krupp

be
absent
more
and
more
often
and
one

she
disappear
altogether
since

vanished
at
the

the

the

how
long
they
remain
so
be
difficult
to
determine
but
since
they
remember

fall
in
the

they
must
have
stayed
until
late

afterward
there

if

we

after
a

he

one
night
they
do
skulk
through

and
darken

they
told
him
their

and
he
threw
up

schneider
himself

he

his

sure
he

but
at

there
be
no
spook
here
and
in

he

and
unharmed

out
he
saw
two
of
his

in
another

diagonally
across
a
little
ell
twenty
minute
later
he
again
glance
out

and
beheld
under
the

the

merely
a

stretch
back
for

seem
endless
as
the

troop
come
closer
he
be
struck
by
their
youth
their
physique
and
the
excellence
of
their
equipment
to
a
german
they
appear
to
lack
discipline
but
there
be
a
certain
jauntiness
about

he
couldn
t
remember
when
he
have
see
such
lan
in

on
an
absurd
impulse
he
decide
that

should
meet

conqueror
and
slip
into
his

and
silently

the

there
after
a

in

the

on
their

any

the

lightly
in
the

they

for

and
some

know
to

at
this

it
must

remember
the

some
be
convince
that
the

be
no
coincidence
that
nazi
fanatic

alfried

he

nevertheless
he
wasn
t
ready
this
seem
to
have
be
a
matter
of
face
it
would
be
unseemly
for
a
german
of
his
eminence
to
appear
anxious
so
he
decide
to
keep
the
american

karl
dohrmann
have
thought
he
would
honor
the

by
dress
in
his
most
expensive
livery
but
to
the
gi
he
merely
look
like
a
rich
man

flunky
and
his
aloof
manner
be
interpret
as
arrogant
condescension

in

it

lastly

form
of
greet
the
householder
himself
be
so
welcome
when
he
return
from
a
long
journey
the
soldier
in
the
two
jeep
on
the
other
hand
be
bound
to
regard
a
mass
of
german
as
ominous
and
they
be
edgy
even
before
their

thus
the
account
of
alfried

must
be
piece
together
from
the
recollection
of
many
individual

and
historian
can
be
at

as

for

since
the

could
now
be

between

yet
the

no

they
have
never

even
if
it

this

be
by
the
very
nature
of
the

practically
impenetrable
berthold
knew
it
therefore
he
approach
the
american
as
soon
as
he
heard
they
be
in
the

in
late
april
with
his

under

in

he
make
his

six

and
spoke
to
a

of
young
american
officer
there
later
he
recall
i
told
them
who
we
be
and
where
we
be
they
be
very
correct
they
come
and
inspect
the

interrogate
my

they
didn

approach
my

out
at

i
show
them
that
he
be
there
they
verify
it
by
star
through
a
window
but
they
didn
t
disturb
him
some
of
berthold

may
have
wonder
why
they
have
be
summon
to
them
the

must
have
appear
as
he

to
a
sympathetic
german
an
old

still
forgotten
by

noch

certainly
the
american
have
no
way
of
know
that
they
be
look
at
the

who
would

most

of

this
be
so
one
would
assume
that
the
first
inspection
of

s
austrian
castle
would
be
quickly
follow
by

it
be
altogether
fitting
and
quite
in
keep
with
the
high
drama
and
absurd
coincidence
which
marked
four
century
of

history
that
the
first

to

should
be
a

who
stumble

in

from

decide
to
liberate
a

and
take

two
decade
later
his

be

but
in
neither
of
them
held
sufficient
rank
to
commandeer
an
estate
on
his
own
therefore
thayer
propose
to
identify
himself
as
a
representative
of
the
general
who
he
would
explain
be
keen
on

few

nothing

the

of
bl

as
soon
as
he
learn
he
be
near
it
like

drove
up
the

with
a

to

as
he
have
every
right
to
be
thayer
say
later
this
the
colonel
decide
be
a
man
with
whom
he
could
do
business
and
after
weigh
effective
approach
he
decide
to
be
appallingly
rude
he
be
certainly
that
in

if

which
table
and
which
din
room
only
after
berthold
have
invite
him
in
do
thayer
appreciate
the

be
certain
he
could
provide
something
suitable
the
family
own
many
in

but
perhaps
the

come
to
see
his
parent
his

be
infirm

his

guess
his

therefore
he
gently

of
his

he
explain
that
the

about

they
be
in

on
the
very

we

from

soften
of
the

and
that
the
state
of

be
such
that
he
be
unable
to
follow
the
proceeding
before
the

or
to
understand
or
cooperate
in
any
interrogation
the
physical
condition
of
the
invalid
be
such
that
he
cannot
be
transport
without
danger
to
his
life
we
believe
after
due
consideration
that
his
condition
be
not
likely
to
improve
but
rather
to
deteriorate
consequently
we
be
unanimously
of
the
opinion
that
he
will
never
be
in
a
physical
or
mental
state
to
appear
before

the

to

the

carefully
but
in
the

of
the

clear
cut
language
there
could
be
no
doubt
what
its
decision
would
be
and
in
a
preliminary
hearing
on

the

petition
for
a
trial
in

be
sharply
question
by
the
lord
chief
justice
do
you
believe
lawrence
ask
jackson
that
it
would
be
in
the
interest
of
justice
to
sentence
a
man
who
on
account
of
illness
be
not
in
a
position
to
conduct
his
defense
properly
the
embarrass
american
reply
that
he
do
not
lawrence
then
turn
to
sir
hartley
shawcross

do
you
agree
with
me
that
accord
to
the
law
of
great
britain
as
well
as
the
law
of
the
united
state
a
man
in
gustav
krupp
s
mental
and
physical
condition
would
be
pronounce

that
the
entire

of
the
krupp

have
be
confiscate
probably
something
like
several
thousand
document
how
could
the
court
expect
him
to
prepare
a
case
without
them
general
taylor
quietly
agree
that
the
request
be
reasonable
counsel
s
allegation
notwithstanding
however
he
add
sharply
a
great
many
of
the
file
have
be
open
to
the
defense
staff
since
late
summer
and
the
rest
would
be
forthcoming
shortly
as
indeed
they
be
on
the
surface
taylor
be
the
winner
nevertheless
kranzb
hler
have
score
suggest
that
the
conqueror
be
abuse
his
police
power
the
colloquy
have
cast
his
client
in
the
role
of

he
be
never
to
relinquish
that
pose
the
general
on
the
other
hand
be
an
avenger
of
all
the
name
which
have
become
associate
with
the
nuremberg
trial
he
declare
from
the
lectern
launch
the
opening
statement
for
the
prosecution
i
suppose
that
none
have
be
a
household
word
for
so
many
decade
indeed
for
nearly
a
century
as
that
of
krupp
the
tribunal
he
go
on
must
understand
that
the
prosecution
be
not
attack
the
business
of
manufacturing
armament
which
inherently
be
no
more
unlawful
than
diplomacy
or
the
military
profession
despite
the
sinister
sheen
which
the
name
have
acquire
over
the
year
the
men
in
the
dock
be
not
on

as

none
be

because
of
his
association
with
the
firm
each
be
answerable
for
specific
act
commit
in
an
individual
capacity
yet
it
must
be
remember
that
although
these
men
be
national
socialist
they
unlike
most
nuremberg
defendant
have
not
risen
to
power
on
the
crest
of
the
nazi
wave
nazism
be
after
all
only
a
temporary
manifestation
of
something
much
old
which
fuse
with
nazi
idea
to
produce
the
third

and
its
pernicious
vitality
or
as

one
wonder

essentially
east

the

be
that

the

mr

disturbed
by

from

write
the

why
be
we
free
so
many
nazi
in
his
reply
mccloy
explain
that
he
have
inherit
these
case
from
general
clay
who
for
one
reason
or
another
have
be
unable
to
dispose
of
them
he
inform
her
he
have
receive
many
letter
and
petition
ask
him
to
set
aside
the
nuremberg
ruling
in
the
light
of
the
tribunal
s
blizzard
of
organize
mail
this
be
probably
an
understatement
and
that
he
consider
it
a
fundamental
principle
of
american
justice
that
accuse
person
shall
have
a
final
right
to
be
heard
so
it
be
that
be
why
the
general
have
appoint
his
appellate
board
which
after
sift
the
entire
record
have
advise
him
that
there
be
no
reason
to
show
mercy
later
the
commissioner
told
this
writer
that
clay
in
transfer
authority
to
him
refer
to
landsberg
and
say
this
be
a
hell
of
a
job
it
be
a
reasonable
remark
he
be
passing
along
responsibility
for
the
life
of
nearly
thirty
men
whose
death
sentence
could
be
change
to
life
imprisonment
by
a
squiggle
of
the
pen
state
governor
frequently
spare
the
condemn
but
they
rarely
pardon
prisoner
and
they
never
appoint
an
appellate
court
to
review
the
decision
of
another
appellate
court
they
can
t
it
be
illegal
yet
that
be
what
mccloy
do
in
police
idiom
he
be
act
on
information
receive
but
it
be
information
solicit
by
a
clemency
board
he
appoint
because
he
told
eleanor
roosevelt
unlike
criminal
case
in
the
united
state
and
england
there
be
no
provision
for
far
court
review
of
these
case
for
possible
error
of

or
of
fact
after
the
court
of
first
instance
pass
upon
them
the
commissioner
s
correspondence
strongly
suggests
that
he
be
unaware
that
precisely
such
a

the

be
as
mccloy
rightly
point
out
irrefutable
evidence
that
his
decision
to
pore
over
the

be
wholly
unrelated
to
the

it
do
not
attest
that
the

its
catastrophe
have
no

john
mccloy
be
among
other
thing
responsible
for
the
administration
of
a
third
of
west
germany
he
would
have
be
justified
in
delegate
the
entire
landsberg
issue
to
peck
but
he
worried
about
the
convict
ferencz
thought
him
generous
and
kindly
anxious
to
make
a
gesture
toward
the
german
whatever
pressure
he
may
have
felt
from
washington
however
much
he
may
have
be
influence
by
the
slaughter
of
american
youth
in
korea
mccloy
be
genuinely
disturbed
by
the
krupp
verdict
we
d
try
him
reluctantly
he
later
told
me
and
the
confiscation
troubled
me
i
consult
my
french
and
british
colleague
and
they
agree
with
me
my
feel
it
be
a
feel
be
that
alfried
be
a
playboy
that
he
hadn
t
have
much
responsibility
i
felt
that
he
have
expiate
whatever
he
d
do
by
the
time
he
d
already
serve
in
jail
oh
i
don
t
doubt
that
he
d
support
the
nazi
early
he
be
a
weakling
brooding
over
the
convict
men
determine
to
touch
every
possible
base
in
the
little
time
he
have
the
hoher
kommissar
personally
travel
to
landsberg
and
talk
to
many
whose
future
if
any
lay
in
his
hand
some
particularly
the
general
be
arrogant
they
deliberately
turn
their
back
but
others
be
quite
decent
they
walk
right
up
and
shook
hand
with
me
for
some
reason
he
didn
t
see
krupp
later
we
met
socially
of
course
at
cocktail
party
the
confrontation
would
have
be
interest
one
cannot
imagine
a
great
contrast
in
the
world
of
commerce
while
both
be
men
with
first
class
mind
the
american
be
humane
outgo
the
german
almost
unapproachable
alfried
probably
wouldn
t
have
turn
his
back
it
would
have
be
more
like
him
to
have
star
right
through
mccloy
though
disappoint
to
historian
the
lack
of
an
encounter
do
strengthen
the
commissioner
s
objectivity
i
go
both
way
with
the
peck
panel
he
say
year
afterward
sometimes
i
be
harder
than
they
suggest
sometimes
softer
but
in
krupp
s
case
their
recommendation
be
unanimous
write
the
author
long
after
the
event
judge
peck
be
in
one
letter
extremely
hazy
about
the
panel
s
advice
on
how
to
dispose
of
the
krupp
question
i
cannot
give
you
the
information
request
he
confess
because
i
have
no
recollection
on
the
subject
this
be
hardly
surprising
over
a
hundred
convict
war
criminal
page
of
verdict
plea
and
brief
from
fifty
lawyer
speak
a
strange
tongue
deliberation
and
the
submission
of
a
report
in
a
whirlwind
of
session
it
be
a
wonder
that
anything
come
of
it
and
have
the
advisory
board
on
clemency
be
obligate
to
weigh
argument
from
the
nuremberg
prosecutor
confuse
it
and
shade
its
conviction
with
doubt
quite
possibly
nothing
would
in
fact
have
be
achieve
therefore
it
be
rather
marvelous
that
from
that
swarm
jabbering
forty
day
night
court
peck
should
in
another
letter
long
after
the

have
remember
that
the

of
alfried
krupp

earl
j
carroll
the
pariah

that

mccloy

year
have
pass
since
the
nuremberg
tribunal
have
told
alfried
that
he
must
submit
to
forfeiture
of
all
your
property
the
english
hadn
t
seize
a
single
krupp
company
in
a
letter
to
a
friend
at
the
stanford
research
institute
mccloy
express
his
anguish
i
be
very
much
puzzle
by
the
english
reaction
to
the
release
of
krupp
in
the
first
place
the
english
refuse
to
try
any
industrialist
and
rather
criticize
us
for
our
vindictiveness
in
do
so
they
could
have
try
krupp
if
they
have
be
willing
to
but
they
early
indicate
that
they
have
no
interest
now
when
we
let
this
man
out
after
he
have
spent
five
year
or
more
in
prison
the
english
newspaper
be
make
a
great
howl
about
it
imply
that
i
take
this
action
as
a
matter
of
expediency
certainly
if
it
have
be
expedient
i
would
not
have
dealt
in
any
way
with
anyone
by
the
name
of
krupp
but
i
could
see
no
reason
to
keep
this
man
in
jail
merely
because
his
name
be
krupp
of
all
the
place
from
which
i
would
least
have
expect
criticism
in
this
case
england
be
first
he
end
by
observe
that
in
a
decision
such
as
this
one
can
only
follow
one
s
conscience
and
not
the
likelihood
of
approbation
or
criticism
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
the
american
high
commissioner
be
conscientious
dedicate
and
determine
to
do
the
just
thing
sincerity
illumines
every
line
he
writes
he
be
as
detach
as
any
man
in
that
difficult
position
could
have
be
he
have
act
as
no
one
s
tool
he
have
do
the
right
as
he
saw
the
right
and
yet
his
vision
be
exceedingly
limited
to
eleanor
roosevelt
he
write
after
detailed
study
of
this
case
i
could
not
convince
myself
that
alfred
sic
krupp
deserve
the
sentence
impose
upon
him
it
be
singular
that
anyone
complete
a
thorough
study
of
nuremberg
proceeding
could
confuse
alfred
krupp
with
alfried
krupp
and
this
lapse
appear
more
than
once
in
mccloy
s
correspondence
the
truth
seem
to
be
that
no
one
involve
in
the
clemency
decision
have
take
a
really
close
look
at
the
record
while
the
commissioner
s
reply
to
justice
wilkins
hint
tantalizingly
at
fresh
disclosure
the
evidence
some
of
which
be
new
indicate
a
rather
lesser
responsibility
on
his
part
if
anything
those
revelation
be
not
cite
as
to
a
member
of
the
overrule
tribunal
at
the
very
least
they
should
have
be
there
be
other
anomaly
in
the
commissioner
s
file
for
that
year
he
assure
mr
roosevelt
that
my
find
have
no
effect
on
the
status
of
the
krupp
plant
the
bulk
of
them
have
be
dismantle
what
remains
be
subject
to
deconcentration
law
yet
that
same
month
he
suggest
to
wilkins
a
justifiable
doubt
over
the
enforceability
of
that
law
in
deal
with
an
exonerate
defendant
krupp
i
be
told
do
not
intend
to
reengage
in
the
steel
business
but
whether
or
not
this
be
merely
a
present
worthy
intention
which
may
be
alter
upon
the
passage
of
time
i
cannot
say
over
and
over
he
repeat
that
he
have
inherit
these
case
from
general
clay
that
krupp
have
have
a
right
to
appeal
that
the
review
be
need
for
possible
error
of
law
or
fact
though
he
enumerate
no
error
which
could
have
withstood
a
prosecutor
s
rebuttal
at
time
the
explanation
which
go
out
over
his
signature
verged
on
sophistry
the
confiscation
decree
have
already
be
partly
rescind
by
general
clay
clay
have
merely
point
out
that
he
couldn
t
enforce
it
outside
the
american
zone
and
in
his
reference
to
foreign
worker
he
merely
mention
krupp
s
use
of
them
never
krupp
s
treatment
of
them
the
hard
rock
upon
which
telford
taylor
have
built
his
case
obviously
the
high
commissioner
be
unfamiliar
with
taylor
s
indictment
the
story
he
heard
be
the
tale
alfried
have
told
the
tribunal
and
retold
in
his
appeal
to
clay
his
lawyer
have
offer
a
version
of
it
to
the
peck
panel
the
panel
accepted
it
have
heard
no
conflict
account
and
pass
it
up
to
mccloy
thus
we
find
the
commissioner
use
in
defense
of
clemency
the
reject
argument
of
a
convict
defendant
a
few
example
krupp
mccloy
on
prejudice
against
the
family
the
name
of
krupp
be
on
the
list
of
war
criminal
because
of
a
notion
which
be
as
old
as
it
be
fallacious
krupp
want
war
and
krupp
make
war
to
the
nuremberg
tribunal
june
as
for
the
particular
case
of
alfried
krupp
i
find
it
difficult
to
understand
the
reaction
on
any
other
basis
than
the
effect
of
a
notorious
name
to
javits
may
on
bias
against
arm
manufacture
although
we
be
not
conscious
of
any
war
guilt
we
be
familiar
with
the
old
myth
of
the
war
guilt
of
the
armament
industry
to
general
clay
august
it
be
true
that
the
name
of
krupp
stand
as
a
symbol
of
the
german
armament
industry
i
be
not
concerned
with
a
symbol
to
javits
it
be
true
that
the
name
of
krupp
have
become
a
symbol
of
evil
the
german
armament
industry
i
be
concerned
not
with
a
symbol
but
with
the
guilt
of
an
individual
alfred
sic
krupp
to
mr
roosevelt
on
alfried
as
a
scapegoat
i
consider
myself
my
father
s
successor
in
this
defendant
dock
i
be
here
in
place
of
my
father
to
the
tribunal
his
father
be
on
his
deathbed
when
these
trial
take
place
and
this
alfried
krupp
be
next
in
line
to
mr
roosevelt
due
to
the
state
of
his
health
he
gustav
be
not
indict
therefore
my
staff
and
i
be
put
on
trial
to
clay
i
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
son
take
his
father
s
place
in
the
dock
largely
because
his
father
be
on
his
deathbed
at
the
time
to
javits
i
never
understood
how
i
suddenly
come
to
take
my
father
s
place
in
the
proceeding
to
clay
this
man
as
you
know
be
not
the
real
krupp
but
be
a
son
who
only
come
into
the
board
late
in
the
war
and
exert
very
little
if
any
influence
in
the
management
of
the
company
to
karl
brandt
at
stamford
on
confiscation
i
request
you
to
quash
the
confiscation
of
my
property
as
unlawful
to
clay
no
other
person
have
have
his
private
property
confiscate
to
mr
roosevelt
in
no
other
case
be
any
individual
s
personal
property
confiscate
to
brandt
on
crime
against
humanity
it
appear
that
the
tribunal
believe
i
approve
of
the
government
s
slave
labor
program
and
exploit
it
in
favor
of
the
firm
to
me
the
government
recruitment
and
allocation
of
manpower
to
the
armament
industry
be
a
measure
of
war
economy
which
we
could
no
more
evade
than
the
numerous
other
government
regulation
during
the
war
to
clay
i
also
found
it
very
doubtful
that
he
have
any
responsibility
for
the
use
of
slave
labor
in
the
krupp
plant
to
javits
moreover
he
be
convict
on
the
slave
labor
charge
every

in
the
ruhr

any
size

and
it
be

by
the
government
and
supervise
by
the
s
and
sd
group
the
company

very
little
if
anything
to
do
with
the
condition
under
which
they
be
employ
to
brandt
so
close
be
these
parallel
that
have
the
high
commissioner
know
that
alfried
have
use
such
language
his
repetition
of
it
would
be
inconceivable
judge
peck
and
his
two
colleague
also
men
of
probity
must
have
share
his
innocence
inevitably
some
aspect
of
the
clemency
decision
remain
murky
everyone
be
keep
at

one
eye
on

believe
that
the

of

be
in
peril
quietly
stage
manage
the
summary
reversal
of
krupp
s
conviction
the

they

be
entirely
legal
that
hitler
have
threaten

if
he
refuse
to

the

that

solely
because
he
have
manufacture

the
most
sensitive
topic
be
slave
labor
understandably
those
who
have
testify
against
the

kept
quiet

altogether
others
who
have
see
chattel
at

in

refuse
to

them
thus
the
fable
arose
that
all

who
have
take
the

have
deny

that

be
an

they

incredibly
alfried
hadn

even
be

on

the

be
suitable

down

slope
of

swiss

someone
else
could

about

this
nevertheless
the

of
london
endorse
the

in

his

argue
herr

be
in
itself
no
proof
of
special
guilt
krupp
now
want
his

he

he
have
found
the

after

you
could

ask

janssen

thirty

and
he

a

within

every

would
be
a

while
he
need
more
capital
a
krupp
could
always
find

and
bonn
would

the

when

they

the

be
purely
physical
he

problem
alfried
explain
in
an
interview
be
that
in
the
year
immediately
after
the
war
partly
through
allied
but
also
even
through
german
influence
all
our
factory
have
be
work
a
little
apart
from
one
another
each
be
indepentent
of
the
rest
and
there
be
no
feel
of
belonging
together
zusammengeh
rigkeit
so
the
first
thing
to
be
do
be
obviously
to
get
all
the
different
factory
and
company
work
together
again
and
to
build
up
a
new
central
administration
in
practice
his
solution
be
the
precise
opposite
decentralization
he
believe
in
bigness
therefore
he
conclude
the
only
way
to
eliminate
the
danger
of
bureaucracy
be
to
introduce
federation
convert
his
empire
into
a
commonwealth
within
which
individual
initiative
will

the

unreconciled
to

he

struck
at

almost
six
year
earlier
even
as
west

mourn
the

so
do
krupp
lament
the

mine
and
steel
mill
in
retrospect
one
wonder
why
once
i
ask
him
outright
whether
it
wouldn
t
have
be
wiser
to
abide
by
the
word
he
have
give
the

add
coolly
this
firm
have
felt
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
year
that
if
you
want
to
produce
good
steel
you
must
stick
to
vertical
integration
it
wasn
t
really
an
answer
integration
wasn
t
the
issue
he
have
sworn
to
the
world
that
he
would
never
produce
any
steel
good
or
otherwise
nevertheless
others
who
raise
the
same
question
receive
essentially
the
same
reply
to
intrafirm
suggestion
that
he
confine
himself
to
manufacturing
and
distribution
the
profit
from
his
essen
grocery
alone
would
have
make
him
a

he
answer
firmly
as
he
do
with
this
writer
that
he
be
a
steelmaker
born
and
breed
a

in

to

must
first
understand

don

that

want

alfried
can
never

that
moreover
he
still
believe
that
the

be
right
that
he
be
battling
for
a
moral
cause
and
that

would
be
a
betrayal
of
the
f
hrer
in
the
month
after
the

alfried

the

paris
accepted

that

that

the

not

the

the

a

his

would
have
be
violent
his
antagonism
to

largely
arose
from
his
fanatical

he
have
declare
that
we
have
no

wait
for

and
obviously
his
great
grandson
couldn

disinherit

nevertheless
the
