have
a

merrill

dive
into
the
fledgling
business
of
derivative
derivative
be
product
whose
value
be
derive
from
something
else
if
you
be
an
ice
cream
maker
you
might
purchase
derivative
whose
value
rise
along
with
the
price
of
milk
that
way
as
high
dairy
price
eat
into
your
ice
cream
profit
your
profit
from
the
rise
value
of
the
derivative
will
make
up
the
difference
in
their
simplest
form
derivative
have
be
around
for
century
their
value
rise
and
fall
along
with
the
actual
or
expect
price
of
commodity
such
as
tulip
bulb
oil

pork
belly
but
in
the
s
they
underwent
a
revolution
mutate
from
simple
structure
track
dairy
price
for
example
to
complex
new
breed
that
say
tracked
the
price
of
a
particular
type
of
milk
in
vermont
in
certain
month
and
that
would
gain
or
lose
value
base
partly
on
the
performance
of
another
dairy
product
in
another
state
in
a
different
time
period
in
theory
anything
could
be
link
milk
with
car
part
order
for
silicon
chip
with
the

of

willing

side
as

become
increasingly
commoditized
specialize
in

be
a
way
to
stand
out
a
corner
of
the
banking
business
not
yet
dominate
by
any
of
the
establish
power
mitchell
s
hunch
be
that
derivative
be
the
future
and
if
his
company
move
fast
and
decisively
merrill
have
a
rare
chance
to
bust
in
and
overtake
some
of

big
bond
trading
house
firm
like
the

salomon

i
begin
to
realize
that
this
be
an
instrument
that
could
pervade

we
do

there

one
crucial
person
left
out
of
this

bill
broeksmit
it
wasn
t
that
mitchell
didn
t
want
him
he
do
in
fact
bill
have
be
the
first
person
edson
try
to
recruit
when
he
knew
he
be
go
to
deutsche
but
bill
wouldn
t
budge
mitchell
not
miss
a
beat
after
be
rebuffed
enlist
him
to
interview
some
candidate
for
senior
deutsche
job
even
though
broeksmit
be
now
technically
his
competitor
part
of
it
be
that
broeksmit
be
conservative
and
it
seem
like
mitchell
and
the
others
be
take
a
flier
another
factor
be
that
the
orange
county
debacle
be
still
play
out
in
the
legal
system
and
in
the
press
and
broeksmit
felt
duty
bound
to
help
tidy
up
the
mess
his
colleague
thought
he
be
crazy
what
kind
of
man
be
so
loyal
to
a
faceless
institution
that
he
would
pas
up
untold
rich
to
do
the
right
thing
it
didn
t
hurt
that
merrill
apply
a
full
court
press
to
keep
him
stan
o
neal
one
of
the
firm
s
top
executive
and
later
its
ceo
lead
the
charge
broeksmit
sat
silently
while
o
neal
present
all
the
reason
he
shouldn
t
bolt
and
o
neal
come
away
with
the
impression
that
he
have
sell
him
on
the
merit
but
the
big
reason
broeksmit
didn
t
take
mitchell
s
bait
be
that
he
be
tire
not
a
quality
that
many
forty
year
old
investment
banker
admit
to
but
you
can
pull
only
so
many
fourteen
hour
day
for
so
many
year
without
it
take
a
toll
he
didn
t
want
to
rise
to
the
next
level
of
management
and
he
worried
that
his
two
young
daughter
be
grow
up
without
a
father
in
march
broeksmit
announce
that
he
be
retire
when
a
merrill
spokesman
told
the
wall
street
journal
that
broeksmit
be
leave
to
spend
more
time
with
his
family

common
euphemism
meaning
someone
get

sign
appear
in
the
lobby
of
deutsche
bank
s
london
headquarters
it
spell
out
the
bank
s
name
phonetically
doy
chuh
this
be
an
important
corrective
many
of
the
american
newcomer
have
be
tell
people
that
they
work
at
douche
bank
slowly
but
not
that
slowly
the
influx
of
american
begin
change
deutsche
s
culture
the
newbie
didn
t
know
the
first
thing
about
the
bank
or
germany
all
they
knew
be
that
their
mandate
be
to
drag
this
tradition
bound
institution
into
modernity
the
way
mitchell
and
his
entourage
saw
it
the
place
s
stubborn
germanness
be
the
main
impediment
to
unleash
its
full
animal
spirit
before
edson
s
arrival
most
of
deutsche
s
prosperous
business
client
have
be
borrowing
money
from
or
issue
bond
via
the
bank
and
then
go
to
a
rival
often
jpmorgan
to
purchase
the
accompany
derivative
to
protect
against
fluctuate
interest
rate
or
other
economic
force
mitchell
s
goal
be
for
deutsche
to
offer
all
of
those
product
in
house
he
position
his
new
derivative
team
lead
by
broeksmit
at
the
very
center
of
the
bank
s
london
trading
floor
so
they
be
within
earshot
of
as
many
trader
and
salesman
as
possible
now
they
just
need
the
german
with
their
deep
distrust
of
cavalier
anglo
american
investment
banker
and
derivative
to
unshackle
them
part
of
the
problem
be
that
the
bank
have
a
hierarchy
baffling
to
the
american
there
be
a
board
of
director
charge
with
supervise
the
company
and
its
executive
but
beneath
that
be
another
board
call
the
vorstand
it
consist
of
eight
top
executive
who
each
have
responsibility
for
a
particular
part
of
the
bank
investment
banking
retail
banking
wealth
management
legal
affair
technology
and
so
on
the
vorstand
operate
by
consensus
and
resist
change
mitchell
wasn
t
even
on
the
vorstand
no
american
ever
have
be
far
complicate
thing
there
be
no
ceo
at
the
bank
instead
one
of
the
vorstand
s
member
be
elect
as
speaker
and
that
man
it
be
always
a
man
be
in
charge
but
only
so
long
as
he
retain
the
support
of
his
colleague
and
of
the
supervisory
board
the
german
saw
the
overlap
board
and
consensus
driven
leadership
system
as
a
source
of
strength
and
stability
preserve
the
fundamental
nature
of
a
proud
german
institution
and
by
design
make
it
hard
to
change
thing
quickly
mitchell
couldn
t
stand
the
slow
pace
and
all
the
pomp
he
found
it
ridiculous
that
the
vorstand
have
its
own
floor
in
tower
a
of
the
frankfurt
skyscraper
accessible
only
by
a
special
elevator
before
anyone
visitor
government
dignitary
employee
could
board
the
elevator
they
have
to
walk
through
metal
detector
and
be
frisk
by
heavily
arm
security
men
it
seem
crazy
that
each
office
on
the
floor
be
palatial
and
decorate
by
the
bank
s
in
house
curator
with
museum
caliber

the
fact
that
vorstand
member
travel
with
a
squadron
of
motorcycle
cop
in
a
convoy
of
bombproof
mercedes

so
heavy
that
men
have
to
strain
with
both
hand
to
open
and
close
them
struck
edson
s
crew
as
completely
over
the
top
quite
a
few
member
of
the
two
board
didn
t
have
the
faintest
idea
about
how
these
american
thought
a
global
bank
be
suppose
to
operate
much
less
one
that
be
try
to
secure
a
foothold
on
wall
street
they
knew
nothing
about
investment
banking
or
trading
or
derivative
other
than
that
they
instinctively
distrust
these
american
export
that
wasn
t
necessarily
a
defect
it
can
be
good
to
have
skeptical
board
member
ask
rudimentary
question
but
guy
like
mitchell
have
extremely
limited
patience
for
people
who
need
thing
explain
twice
what
s
more
mitchell
and
his
colleague
get
the
distinct
impression
that
the
german
especially
those
on
the
vorstand
be
try
to
foil
them
by
veto
transaction
and
slow
walk

they
want

of

and
the
moniker
stuck
among
his

the
german
for
their
part
thought
the
grow
pile
of
derivative
accumulate
on
deutsche
s
book
be
a
cause
for
concern
a
fear
that
would
eventually
prove
well
found
at
almost
every
executive
meeting
we
talk
about
the

brought
about
by
the

of

we
be
proud
of
the

look
at

ilk
with
a
combination
of
disdain
and
fear
they
refer
to
the
american
as
bandit
and
anarchist
we
can
t
control
them
a
vorstand

lament
mitchell

to
relish
his
reputation
as
a
powerful
outlaw

in

didn
t
recognize
him
and
ask
who
he

he
realize
that
the
vorstand

dearth
of

knowledge
could
play
into
his
team

all
this
power
away
from

the
situation

in

technocratic
manner
be
the
sort
of

that

duplication
of

dissipation
of

it
do
not

that

he
stop
shave
and
let

he
suddenly
wasn

for
weekend
the
wisley

become
rare
and
he
would
show
up
at
work
a
little
later
in
the
morning
his
crew
gossiped
that
something
be
up
with
edson
but
they
didn
t
know
what
a
month
later
mitchell
pull
kebede
aside
at
work
i
have
to
tell
you
something
he
confide
i
m
see
estelle
what
kassy
ask
she
s
my

edson
say
word
dribble
out

found
on

craft
it
into
what
she

and
his

and
sense
his
vulnerability
aside
from
bill

alla
he

colleague
it
be
a
paradox
for
a
man
with
such
power
over
people
a
reflection
perhaps
of

if

it
wouldn

you

be
in

if
you

breuer
flew

a

a
top
deutsche
executive
and
edson
s
bos
that
we
don
t
need

anymore
his
point
be
that
the
banker
trust
trader
be
such
star
that
they
could
make
bucket
of
money
by

that
there
be

business
of
earn
slender

on

of

this
be
manifestly
untrue
banker
trust
be
in
dire
shape
largely
because
its
trader
kept
mess
up
but
even
if
the
statement
wasn
t
false
it
wasn
t
a
safe
or
sustainable
way
to
run
a
bank
ackermann
would
come
to
rue
have
miss
that
bright
red
flag
inside
deutsche
some
senior

include
jain

a

jain
express
his

two
week
after

bad

for

because
it
make

when
a

so
even
before

built
on

unless

confess

would
like
to
reiterate
that
we
deeply
regret
the
misery
and
injustice
suffer
and
that
we
acknowledge
the
bank
s
ethical
and
moral
responsibility
that
be
good
enough
to
get
the

it

out
how

ackermann
ever
drawn

have
the

commission
quarterly
opinion
survey
to
measure
his
stand
with
the
german
public
he
have
an
unseemly
tendency
to
boast
about
how
much
michael

like
him
or
about
how
he
d
receive

meeting

about
how
he
have

why

wonder
be
this

so
desperately
insecure
some
of
his

believe
he
be
a

more
though
felt
he
be
propel
by
personal
feeling
of
inadequacy
that
he
yearn
to
overcome
but
never
could
in
september
ackermann
kick
the
bank
into
overdrive
he
have
become
obsess
with
a
metric
call
return
on
equity
a
measure
in
percentage
term
of
how
much
an
investment
in
the
company
generate
in
profit
over
a
give
year
the
figure
obviously
matter
to
investor
and
it
matter
to
ackermann
partly
because
his
compensation
be
contingent
in
part
on
how
the
bank
perform
for
stockholder
and
partly
because
it
be
a
yardstick
that
he
could
measure
himself
against
the
objective
ackermann
declare
publicly
be
for
the
bank
by
to
achieve
a
return
on
equity
of
percent
that
meant
that
for
every
dollar
invest
the
bank
be
create
a
new
twenty
five
cent
of
earnings
our
target
be
aggressive
but
realistic
he
declare
that
year
the
bank
s
return
be
on
track
to
be
percent
so
ackermann
be
call
for
them
to
nearly
double
within
two
year
but
that
understated
the
extent
of
his
ambition
only
a
year
earlier
the
bank
s
return
have
be
a
measly
percent
ackermann
s
percent
aim
be
stratospheric
by
comparison
into
the

deutsche

also
the
cancellation
of

ackermann

you

be
about
how

the

about

for
it

his
cadre
stampede
across

that
the

have
spent

groom
one
example
be
the
advertising
company
publicis
a
long
stand
client
of
cohrs
s
team
the
relationship
have
last
in
part
because
it
have
be
conservative
investment
banker
be
often
disparage
for
dispense
self
serve
or
destructive
advice

but
the
best
banker
strategy
be
to
earn
money
by
earn
trust
in
the
case
of

s
relationship
with
publicis
that
approach
struck
anshu

underling
as
tedious
a
team
from

market
look
for
a
shorter
road
to

they
set
up

that

pursue

that
meant
it
be
almost
certainly
get
its

dirty
with

the
only
question

how

and
whether
the

would
leave

what
it
take

himself
be
an
unabashed
cheerleader
of

s
expansion
into

just
as

into
the
henry

ackermann

into

at

he
seem

scream
at

lash
out
when

the
result
be
that
when
jain
gather
his
senior
team
in
his
office
they
would
go
around
the
circular
table

each

would
awkwardly
pay

know
as

him
considerable

therefore
less
attractive
for

one
of

sober
conclusion
the

be
worth
zero
that
be
more
than
an

it
meant

its
annual
result
the
last
thing
the
bank
need
as
it
head
into
a
crisis
so
broeksmit
suggest
a
work
around
mortgageit
should
keep
issue
mortgage
avoid
the
risky
stuff
that
have
be
its
specialty
and
instead
focus
on
large

to
safe
customer
this
do
nothing
at
all
to
deal
with
the
awful
loan
mortgageit
have
already
make
but
it
would
allow
the
company
to
hover
in

keep
alive
the
prospect
of

the

bittar
have

all
you

the

the

the

the

him
troy

pretty
sure
bill
didn
t
grasp
the
nuance
of
their

it
be

complex
they
believe
for
someone
of
his
age
and
lack

sophistication
to
comprehend
broeksmit
could
tell
he
be

off

he
decide

over

invite
troy

out
to
dinner
at

get
off
to
an
awkward
start
with

continue
to
bicker
about
the
wisdom
of
the

neither

would
drop
it
across

some
of
the

snicker
to
one
another
that
bill
be
out
of
his
depth
the
conversation
eventually
meander
to
seemingly
safer
topic
like
jerry
sandusky
the
former
college
football
coach
who
have
just

sentence
to

broeksmit
have
never

him
when
someone
remark
that
sandusky
be
in
for
a
tough
time
in

bill
ask
why
the

look
at

be
this
guy
for
real
someone
answer
that
it

because
he
molest
boy
bill

so
he
didn

get
it
child
molester
be
the
most
revile
crook
in
a
prison
broeksmit
kept
ask
question
that
betrayed
his
ignorance
about
college
football
and
prison
hierarchy
the
trader
start
chuckle
again
this
old
man
be
clueless
at
the
end
of
the
meal
bill
picked
up
the
tab
and
bolt
for
the
subway
hardly
bother
to
say
goodbye
dixon
and
the
other
trader
go
off
to
a
bar
to
laugh
about
him
and
kept
mock
him
at
work
for
several
day
this
guy
be
fuck
weird
here
be
a
powerful
sign
of
the
generational
shift
that
have
swept
wall
street
and
deutsche
in
the
decade
since
broeksmit
have

who
have

the

know
everything
dixon

ultimately
blew
up
cost
deutsche
million
and
attract
the
attention
of
federal
regulator
bill
be
astute
and
sensitive
surely
he
didn
t
miss
the
unsubtle
cue
his
time
have
pass
in
deutsche
hire
a
young
man

eric
ben

dramatically
eric
become
a

like
so
many
others
with
those
qualification
he
have
drift
into
banking
lure
by
the
money
and
the
challenge
of
solve
complex
financial
riddle
but
after
a
spell
at
goldman
sachs
he
discover
that
he
didn
t
have
the
right
constitution
for
wall
street
the
way
he
saw
it
he
wasn
t
aggressive
enough
to
be
a
salesman
and
wasn
t
greedy
enough
to
be
a
banker
his
goal
be
to
ease
into
academia
and
he
figure
the
deutsche
gig
with
a
heavy
emphasis
on
theoretical
research
about
how
to
determine
the
value
of
derivative
be
a
step
in
the
right
direction
he
also
figure
a
giant
international
bank
knew
what
it
be
do
ben
artzi
s
job
consist
in
part
of
use
microsoft
excel
to
build
model
to
check
the
valuation
of
derivative
and
to
see
how
they
would
fare
in
various
scenario
include
once
in
a
millennium
financial
storm
ben
artzi
quickly
realize
the
bank
s
clunky
system
produce
fuzzy
imprecise
result
one
of
the
big
problem
be
that
the
trade
he
be
plug
into
excel
be
leveraged
meaning
the
trader
have
make
them
use
borrow
money
a
tactic
that
could
increase
their
profitability
but
also
make
them
much
riskier
but
the
number
he
have
be
give
didn
t
account
for
the
financial
consequence
of
that
leverage
in
other
word
they
be
greatly
underestimate
the
risk
involve
in
the
transaction
at
first
ben
artzi
give
the
bank
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
presumably
this
be
the
result
of
sloppiness
not
fraud
and
the
bank
s
high
ups
didn
t
realize
how
inadequate
their
model
be
within
a
few
week
though
he
have
ask
enough
question
and
receive
enough
stonewall
to
conclude
that
executive
didn
t
want
to
know
why
the
model
be
wrong
they
just
want
result
that
would
confirm
the
wisdom
of
the
present
course
when
he
flag
the
leverage
problem
to
his
superior
he
be
told
not
to
ask
so
many
question
when
he
persist
a
superior
march
over
to
his
desk
and
shout
at
him
to
stop
like
his
relative
ben
artzi
be
stubborn
and
he
didn
t
stop
the
more
he
dug
the
more
concerned
he
become
trade
that
the
bank
be
value
in
the
billion
of
dollar
appear
to
be
basically
worthless
this
do
not
look
like
an
accident
the
bank
appear
to
have
be
systematically
inflate
the
value
of
ten
of
billion
of
dollar
of
derivative
this
meant
that
deutsche
s
much
tout
resilience
during
the
financial
crisis
have
be
illusory
the
product
of
bogus
accounting
that
be
so
stun
that
ben
artzi
initially
doubt
it
could

the

have
show
that

be

of

that
require
bank
like
deutsche
to
buttress
their
american
operation
deutsche
s
first
response
be
to
tinker
with
the
legal
structure

apply

type
of

that

if

keep

he
would
need
to
identify

trouble

that
serious

far
too
great
even
deutsche
it
seem
be
now
off
limit
after

chicago

especially
since
it
be
the
second
time
that
a
division
of
the

have
effectively
banish
him
as
a
client
jared
kushner
have
married
ivanka
trump
in
and
he
be
become
familiar
with
the
trump
family

he
knew
his

of

observer

there
at

jared

invite

over
to

to
meet
his
wife
and
father
in
law
trump
explain
his
situation
to
the
banker
and
then
he
popped
the
big
question
would
deutsche
s
private
bank
be
willing
to
lend
him
or
million
with
chicago
s
trump
international
hotel
tower
as
collateral
that
would
allow
him
to
repay
what
he
still
personally
owe
deutsche
for
the
chicago
loan
why
on
earth
would
one
arm
of
deutsche
even
consider
lending
money
to
pay
off
default
debt
owe
to
another
part
of
the
company
the
answer
be
that
vrablic
be
excite
by
the
prospect
of
land
a
major
deal
with
a
major
new
client
she
brought
the
proposal
to
tom
bower
who
agree
that
it
be
worth
consider
a
small
team
sift
through
trump
s
personal
and
corporate
financial
record
and
tax
return
the
first
thing
the
banker
notice
be
that
trump
be
assign
absurdly
rich
value
to
his
real
estate
asset
in
one
especially
egregious
case
he
claimed
that
an
estate
he
d
purchase
in
new
york
s
westchester
county
for
about
million
be
now
worth
million
his
stratospheric
valuation
be
extremely
aggressive
recall
a
person
who
review
the
document
he
use
the
most
optimistic
assumption
at
all
time
the
bank
end
up
reduce
the
asset
value
by
as
much
as
percent
the
funny
thing
be
that
notwithstanding
trump
s
serial
exaggeration
his
underlie
finance
weren
t
all
that
bad
he
have
limited
debt
at
least
compare
to
his
fellow
real
estate
magnate
and
cash
be
pour
in
from
the
apprentice
and
from
licensing
deal
he
d
struck
to
put
his
name
on
property
he
didn
t
own
make
the
deal
more
palatable
for
deutsche
trump
be
willing
to
personally
guarantee
the
loan
meaning
that
deutsche
in
theory
could
seize
his
asset
if
he
didn
t
pay
it
back
the
fact
that
a
similar
albeit
small
personal
guarantee
hadn
t
prevent
him
from
default
on
the
original
chicago
loan
do
not
seem
to
bother
the
bank
aside
from
the
minor
detail
that
he
be
a
recidivist
defaulter
trump
look
like
an
attractive
borrower
vrablic
and
bower
tentatively
agree
to
lend
him
million
because
this
would
be
the
first
time
the
private
banking
division
have
lent
money
to
trump
it
have
to
go
through
a
few
committee
inside
the
bank
for
final
sign
off
and
this
be
where
thing
get
rocky
when
top
executive
in
anshu
s
investment
banking
unit
heard
that
another
division
be
about
to
rekindle
the
trump
relationship
they
go
ballistic
jain
make
the
case
at
a
meeting
of
the
bank
s
top
executive
how
on
earth
could
deutsche
do
business
with
this
guy
after
he
have
so
publicly
burn
the
bank
what
precedent
would
that
set
for
other
would
be
deadbeat
if
trump
default
yet
again
which
seem
entirely
possible
how
would
deutsche
explain
that
to
investor
and
regulator
bower
and
vrablic
argue
that
from
the
private
bank
s
standpoint
the
loan
be
sound
what
s
more
deutsche
and
trump
have
settle
their
litigation
back
in
they
try
to
pacify
their
colleague
by
point
out
the
surreal
fact
that
the
new
loan
from
deutsche
s
private
banking
arm
would
allow
trump
to
repay
what
he
owe
the
investment
banking
division
bower
and
vrablic
grumble
that
the
investment
banker
be
just
jealous
that
the
private
banker
have
figure
out
how
to
structure
a
loan
with
trump
in
a
way
that
seem
virtually
risk
free
for
deutsche
bower
wasn
t
afraid
of
a
fight
he
d
earn
a
reputation
for
play
hardball
with

now
he
ask
his
bos

byrne
now
ran
but
the
two
men
have
stayed
in
touch
now
in
early
trump
told
byrne
he
be
prepare
to
buy
the
doral
and
ask
whether
deutsche
would
consider
provide

byrne
agree
to
take
a
look
at
the
number
not
bother
to
tell
trump
that
there
be
zero
chance
deutsche
would
actually
help
him
byrne
though
didn
t
know
that
the
private

division
be
in

trump
invite
vrablic
to

she
walk
into
bower
s
office
trump
want
to
go
buy
doral
she
explain
and
he
want
deutsche
to
loan
him
the
money
for
the
purchase
for
the
second
time
in

matter
of

bower
dispatch
a
team
to
study
a
possible
trump
loan
the
private
bank
already
knew
his
finance
now
they
get
to
know
the
doral
s
number
the
conclusion
be
that
trump
seem
to
be
get
the
resort
at
a
reasonable
price
and
trump
not
only
agree
to
personally
guarantee
the
loan
but
he
also
vowed
to
add
million
of

to
his
wealth
management
account
at
deutsche
the
bank
charge
fee
for
manage
those
asset
and
so
the
relationship
with
trump
would
become
a
bit
more
lucrative
the
caveat
trump
and
his
daughter
ivanka
warn
vrablic
be
that
if
deutsche
couldn
t
get
the

approve
quickly
they
d
have
to
shop
it
to
a
rival
bank
it
be
of
course
a
bluff
no
other
bank
be
go
to
touch
trump
but
it
have
its
intend
effect
kick
deutsche
s
underwriting
process
into
overdrive
the
private
bank
be
ready
to
pull
the
trigger
but
once
again
the

in

broeksmit
push
for

gigantic

flow

that
the

this
should
have
be
a

deutsche
be

not
the
kind
of
dodgy
outfit
likely
to
be

in

money
laundering
but
there
be
a
protocol
for
hellenic
to
follow
in
such
situation
and
it
call
for
the
filing
of

the

originate

it
ask

to
explain
its

the

of

the

deutsche

instead
it

and
sure
enough
the

never

he
would
later
explain
to

under

he
struck
the

as
beaten
down

simple
val
knew
firsthand
how
easy
it
be
to
push
thing
too
far
what
he
couldn
t
understand
what
continued
to
drive
him
crazy
be
what
have
lead
his
father
to
die
despite
the
coldness
bill
have
acknowledge
in

the
black
sheep
on
the
road
to
be

why
before
leave
london
val
have
write
down
all
of
his

password
now
he
sign
into
his
dad
s
yahoo
and
gmail

wander
more
or
less
aimlessly
through
thousand
of

he
hadn
t
give
up
hope
that
he
would
encounter
evidence
of
a
secret
lover
or
crush
debt
or
some
other
awful
secret
that
while
painful
to
confront
would
reveal
why
his
father
felt
he
have
no
choice
but
to
die
after
a
couple
of
day
though
val
conclude
that
even
if
such
a
clean
explanation
exist
and
he
be
begin
to
doubt
it
it
wouldn
t
be
easy
to
find
there
be
three
main
type
of
message
in
bill
s
email
account
the
first
be
personal
stuff
year
of
detailed
record
of
bill
s
arrange
dinner
or
vacation
or
trip
to
the
russian
and
turkish
bath
bantering
about
finance
or
politics
with
friend
and
colleague
and
deal
with
an
enormous
volume
of
logistics
and
financial
management
for
his
wife
child
and
extend
family
these
be
interest
to
val
in
a
voyeuristic
way
but
they
weren
t
enlighten
the
second
category
of
email
be
spam
bill
have
be
constantly
bombard
with
the
usual
offer
of
porn
magical
weight
loss
pill
surgical
enlargement
and
republican
national
committee
fundraiser
the
final
variety
be
stuff
related
to
deutsche
and
this
be
the
area
to
which
val
start
to
devote
most
of
his
wake
hour
through
process
of
elimination
he
have
begin
to
suspect
that
whatever
have
lead
his
father
to
kill
himself
might
have
have
something
to
do
with
his
job
there
must
be
something
in
those
email
val
figure
why
else
would
deutsche
official
have
poked
around
in
bill
s
computer
right
after
his
death
and
the
fact
that
one
of
his
farewell
note
be
to
anshu
one
of
the
world
s
most
powerful
banker
add
to
val
s
conviction
that
deutsche
have
be
on
his
mind
when
he
decide
to
die
val
have
glance
at
jain
s
letter
when
the
police
force
him
to
identify
his
father
s
handwrite
but
he
hadn
t
read
the
word
some
of
the
deutsche
email
make
sense
to
val
it
quickly
become
clear
for
example
that
anshu
have
turn
to
bill
again
and
again
to
extinguish
problem
that
be
burning
the
bank
it
be
also
obvious
that
bill
at
time
felt
overwhelmed
conclude
that
bank
of
deutsche
s
size
be
simply
too
big
to
manage
hard
to
know
how
bank
keep
track
of
the
hundred
of
billion
flow
through
their
pipe
every
day
broeksmit
write
in
one
email
to
a
friend
and
val
knew
his
father
well
enough
to
detect
when
he
be
angry
as
he
clearly
be
when
he
be
scold
his
dbtca
colleague
for
their
lackadaisical
approach
to
the
fed

test
but
the
overwhelm
majority
of
the
message
be
incomprehensible
jammed
with
jargon
acronym
and
big
number
val
need
guidance
about
what
to
search
for
and
someone
to
translate
what
he
found
five
month
earlier

achleitner
be
worried

her
prize
client
trump
s
executive
assistant
rhona
graff
greet
her
like
an
old
friend
and
it
be
instantly
clear
to
jain
that
vrablic
be
a
regular
there
inside
trump
s
clutter
office
vrablic
be
warm
and
casual
not
only
with
trump
but
also
with
ivanka
when
she
popped
in
before
the
meeting
jain
have
receive
a
small
dossier
describe
trump
s
background
and
the
bank
s
relationship
with
him
and
over
lunch
they
have
a
brief
chat
about
trump
s
finance
anshu
comment
that
he
be
surprised
by
donald
s
relatively
low
level
of

jain
left
the
meeting
feel
impressed
with
vrablic
who
return
to
her
office
and
told
colleague
that
the
ceo
have
sound
upbeat
about
lending
to
trump
deutsche
via
dbtca
soon
agree
to
lend
million
to
trump
old
post
office
llc
a
newly
incorporate
company
in
delaware
the
loan
didn
t
have
to
be
fully
paid
back
for
a
decade
but
trump
be
personally
on
the
hook
for
most
of
the
money
if
he
default
deutsche
could
come
after
his
personal
asset
a
couple
of
year
later
on
the
presidential
campaign
trail
trump
would
cite
his
new
washington
hotel
as
proof
of
the
financial
and
management
acumen
he
would
bring
to
the
white
house
and
there
be
some
truth
to
his
savvy
at
wring
every
last
cent
out
of
his
patron
at
deutsche
bank
though
that
be
not
necessarily
the
type
of
talent
trump
be
try
to
boast
about
like
the
doral
loan
whose
low
interest
rate
have
stun
rich
byrne
the
old
post
office
transaction
be
surprisingly
inexpensive
for
a
borrower
whose
credit
history
be
scar
by
repeat
default
i
m
borrowing
money
at
number
like

trump
exclaim
to
the
journalist
william
cohan
it
s
crazy
i
ve
never
see
anything
like
it
inside
deutsche
after
the
initial
furor
over
the
resuscitation
of
the
trump
relationship
the
post
office
loan
didn
t
receive
so
much
scrutiny
like
the
prior
loan
it
be
write
up
in
a
report
that
be
sent
to
member
of
the
dbtca
oversight
board

have
the
authority
to
summon

to
explain
why
on
earth
they
be
shovel
so
much
money
in
trump
s
direction
especially
when
no
other
bank
dare
touch
him
but
nobody
ask
question
deutsche

work
by
now

for
help
and
deutsche
coughed
up
a
nearly
million
mortgage
repayable
in
three
year
that
preserve
for
a
short
while
the
fantasy
of
don

as
a
not
unsuccessful
businessman
day
before
the

s
due
date
the
elder
trump
use
a
specially
create
llc
db
pace
acquisition
to
buy
the
loan
from
deutsche
bank
hence
the
db
this
be
yet
another
favor
to
trump
normal
bank
customer
couldn
t
just
walk
in
and
purchase
a
family
member

problematic
loan
when
don
jr
predictably
default
db
pace
foreclose
on
the
warehouse
thus
keep
it
in
the
hand
of
the
trump
family
and
out
of
reach
of
titan
atlas

other
creditor
the
kushners
start
receive
personal
loan
from
vrablic
s
department
too
this
have
be
impossible
for
year
because
charles
kushner
jared
s
father
have
be
convict
of
tax
evasion
and
witness
tamper
even
at

be
the

patriarch
s
incarceration
have
make
the
entire

essentially
off

but
vrablic
and
ivanka
have
grown
tight
they
weren
t
quite
friend
but
they
saw
a
lot
of
each
other
at
social

since
before
her

bring
deutsche

the
favor
he
own
the
new

observer
an
influential
weekly

and
soon
it
be
apparently

a
lever
with
deutsche
one
top
investment
banking
executive
who
have
lobby
against

pretty
sure
that
a
series
of
negative
story
about
him
in
the
observer
have
be
plant
by
a
longtime
deutsche
rival
who
happen
to
be
close
to
the

the

have
create
a
couple
of
offshoot

to
write
about
the

and
in
late

he
told
kushner

very
compelling
story
just
go
meet
with
her
kushner
say
you
ll
figure
something
out
so
gaines

and
he

about

on

so
worried
five

if
the

by

spent
a
couple
of

to
some
of
the
guy
on
bittar

conclusion
be
that
the

have
a
plausible
strategy
to
make
money
off
of
rate
move
in
very
specific
direction
by
very
specific
amount
he
told
anshu
that
he
have
not
found
evidence
of
bittar
s
do
anything
improper
the
profit
appear
real
that
be
enough
for
the
star
trader
to
get
paid
and
as
it
turn
out
for
bittar
and
his
colleague
to
keep
their
scheme
alive
and
for
deutsche
to
keep
make
money
it
be
a
huge
mistake
if
broeksmit
have
dug
deeper
deutsche
might
not
have
land
in
the
middle
of
an
international
criminal

the

all
he

that

broeksmit
some
heartburn
they
breeze
through
the
rest
of
the
issue
that
bill
have
dealt
with
shoot
each
down
as
a
possible
source
of
stress
for
example
when
it
come
to
dbtca
the
bank
acknowledge
it
be
an
unholy
mess
but
it
wasn
t
bill
s
mess
the
report
assert
that
he
be
not
responsible
for
dbtca
that
ignore
the
reality
that
as
a
board
member
broeksmit
unquestionably
have
responsibility
and
he
have
spent
month
agonize
and
squabble
over
the
health
of
the
entity
and
senior
executive
at
the

almost
certainly
include
sew
knew
it
the
review
also
look
at
how
bill
have
be
affected
by
bafin
s
rejection
of
his
promotion
deutsche
conclude
that
he
have
take
the
disappointment
in
stride
buck
up
by
the
steadfast
support
of
his
loyal
colleague
that
be
another
claim
that
the
bank

senior
executive
include
anshu
knew
to
be
false
bill
have
be
devastate
sew
and
dodds
also
falsely
insist
that
the
bank
have
never
sent
someone
over
to
the
broeksmit
flat
in
london
to
copy
bill
s
hard
drive
the
bottom
line
the
review
have
turn
up
nothing
that
show
a
direct
link
between
broeksmit
s
death
and
his
work
at
deutsche
bank
as
validation
for
this
questionable
premise
sew
note
that
in
the
month
since
the
bank
s
internal
review
have
be
wrap
up
broeksmit
s
name
hadn
t
surface
in
the
public
realm
in
any
of
the
investigation
that
have
entangle
deutsche
rocco
knew
that
too
be
false
bill
have
be
mention
on
numerous
occasion
in
bob
roach
s
senate
report
on
tax
avoidance
in
july
that
be
a
sign
rocco
later
write
to
alla
that
deutsche
s
investigation
be
not
exhaustive
and
not
as
dynamic
as
both
dodds
and
sew
have
described
it
the
meeting
last
about
ninety
minute
it
seem
carefully
script
and
certainly
both
simon
and
christian
be
very
careful
in
what
they
say
to
me
rocco
note
add
that
the
review
systematically
downplayed
the
extent
of
bill
s
involvement
in
trouble
spot
at
the
bank
sew
and
dodds
could
not
explain
the
coroner
s
finding
or
the
medical
record
that
establish
that
bill
be
fearful
of
civil
liability
and
perhaps
even
prosecution
because
of
his
work
at
the
bank
rocco
didn
t
realize
it
but
there
be
one
other
sign
that
deutsche
might
have
be
economical
with
the
truth
and
at
the
very
least
be
hypersensitive
about
the
report

content
some
member
of
the

ask

not

in

the

have
enter

dark

we

he
realize
the
end
of
his
generation
of

be
approach
and
maybe
he
could
not
deal
with
it
definitely
the
fact
that
in
the
last
two
year
he
do
not
have
a
clear
job
due
to

not

even
this

seem
to
skip

what
his

not
the
kind
that
would
lead
them
to
expect
suicide

enough
that
they
found
it

even
before

broeksmit

from
donald

two
year
later
in
october
the
presidential
campaign
be
wind
down
and
it
be
time
for
offit
to
repay
that
favor
trump
be
get
pillory
for
his
pattern
of
bankruptcy
offit
wasn
t
a
big
fan
of
trump
s
politics
but
he
loathe
hillary
and
he
be
willing
to
do
just
about
anything
to
avoid
her
win
the
white
house
offit
held
his
nose
and
try
to
ignore
the
fact
that
mnuchin
be
the
finance
chairman
of
trump
s
campaign
he
ponder
how
trump
might
be
able
to
blunt
the
attack
about
his
personal
finance
it
didn
t
take
him
long
to
gin
up
a
strategy
who
be
the
big
financial
villain
out
there
hedge
fund
and
they
be
the
villain
trump
should
blame
for
his
checker
financial
history
he
d
have
to
declare
bankruptcy
because
greedy
hedge
fund
be
so
obsess
with
wring
every
last
dollar
out
of
poor
donald
trump
that
they
have
refuse
to
let
him
renegotiate
his
crush
debt
this
be
not
really
true
but
it
sound
good
and
the
line
of
attack
mesh
with
trump
s
populist
rhetoric
on
the
campaign
trail
where
he
d
accuse
hedge
fund
manager
of
get
away
with
murder
through
the
tax
code
these
be
guy
that
shift
paper
around
and
they
get
lucky
he
d
declare
in
a
tv
interview
offit
s
wife
have
forbidden
her
husband
from
do
anything
to
assist
trump
who
have
gross
her
out
ever
since
offit
have
work
with
him
at
deutsche
but
the
election
be
look
like
a
landslide
and
offit
convince
her
to
let
him
email
trump
with
his
political
advice
on
a
friday
even
offit
typed
up
a
lengthy
message
explain
that
trump
s
argument
that
he
be
simply
use
the
bankruptcy
law
in
an
advantageous
way
wasn
t
resonate
with
voter
i
believe
there
be
a
much
well
answer
that
may
help
defuse
this
issue
and
be
just
arrogant
enough
to
suggest
it
offit
write
he
get
no
response
and
wasn
t
even
sure
that
trump
have
read
the
email
tammy
mcfadden
have
work
in
deutsche

refuse

but
manager
didn
t
want
to
hear
it
he
be
a
lucrative
client
he
would
remain
a

until
june
week
before
he
be
criminally
charge
with

lord
help
us
all
mcfadden
would
tell
me
next
in
early
mcfadden
have
notice
that
many
customer
of
the
private
bank
include
quite
a
few
of
vrablic
s
super
rich
client
didn
t
have
the
proper
documentation
attach
to
their
account
this
be
especially
problematic
for
customer
who
be
classify
as
politically
expose
person
a
designation
that
be
suppose
to
subject
them
to
extra
vet
because
of
the
heighten
risk
that
they
could
be
involve
in
bribery
or
other
public
corruption
after
initially
notice
the
problem
in
a
couple
of
isolated
account
mcfadden
do
a
broader
review
and
found
more
than
a
hundred
politically
expose
client
who
didn
t
have
the
requisite
documentation
show
thing
like
where
their
money
come
from
among
those
customer
she
realize
be
donald
trump
and
his
family
member
when
mcfadden
alert
her
superior
they
told
her
not
to
worry
about
it
mcfadden
didn
t
let
it
go
lodge
a
complaint
with
the
hr
department
and
in
the
process
anger
her
boss
now
in
the
summer
of
with
trump
have
clinched
the
republican
nomination
and
kushner
serve
as
his
adviser
mcfadden
be
assign
the
task
of
review
a
number
of
transaction
in
the
kushner
company
account
that
have
trigger
alert
in
deutsche
s
computer
system
right
off
the
bat
she
could
see
why
the
transaction
have
tripped
up
the
software
kushner
s
real
estate
company
be
move
money
to
a
number
of
russian
individual
that
didn
t
mean
there
be
anything
improper
it
certainly
wasn
t
proof
of
money
laundering
but
it
be
unusual
mcfadden
do
some
research
look
into
the
recipient
of
the
money
and
into
the
kushner
company
history
of
move
fund
overseas
and
conclude
that
the
appropriate
response
be
for
deutsche
to
file
a
suspicious
activity
report
with
fincen
the
arm
of
the
treasury
department
responsible
for
police
financial
crime
bank
file
thousand
of
such
report
every
year
and
this
didn
t
strike
mcfadden
as
an
especially
close
call
she
typed
up
a
report
and
sent
it
to
her
superior
normally
a
propose
suspicious
activity
report
would
be
review
by
another
money
laundering
expert
one
who
be
outside
the
business
unit
where
the
transaction
in
question
originate
in
this
case
the
private
banking
division
it
be
important
to
keep
thing
separate
otherwise
employee
with
financial
interest
in
see
transaction
go
through
unimpeded
would
be
call
the
shot
potentially
compromise
the
effectiveness
of
deutsche
s
already
questionable
anti
money
laundering
safeguard
this
time
though
word
travel
back
to
mcfadden
that
her
report
be
be
kill
by
manager
in
the
private
bank
mcfadden
be
pretty
sure
this
be
an
example
of
the
private
bank
try
to
preserve
its
lucrative
relationship
with
the
kushners
and
therefore
the
trump
at
the
cost
of
not
adhere
to
anti
money
laundering
law
she
hadn
t
survive
at
bank
for
decade
without
know
how
to
stand
up
for
herself
and
her
work
more
than
a
decade
earlier
she
d
sue
bank
of
america
for
racially
discriminate
against
her
and
other
black
employee
and
now
she
start
make
more
noise
that
be
not
the
way
to
get
ahead
at
deutsche
as
guy
like
eric
ben
artzi
could
have
told
her
boss
deride
mcfadden
to
colleague
as
a
crazy
difficult
woman
soon
she
be
transfer
to
another
division
and
then
in
april
fire
mcfadden
have
found
something
important
the
kushners
with
their
long
stand
tie
not
just
to
deutsche

also
to

the

factor
the

instinct
that

what
be
more
alarm
to
the

be
that
the

have
produce
a
number
of
document
over
the

that
flag
the
large

they

these
be
call
exposure
report
and
their
purpose
be
to
make
sure
that
someone
up
the

be
aware
of
the
full
extent
of
a

that
if
it
sour
have
the
potential
to
inflict
serious
financial
or
reputational
damage
on

yet
as
far
as
the

could
determine
from

to

the
report
have
never
be
view
by
anyone
at
a
senior
level
the
blame
the
board
conclude
rest
in
large
part
with
deutsche
s
antiquate
technology
and
a
compartmentalize
management
setup
in
which
just
about
everyone
could
plausibly
claim
that
police
a
relationship
with
a
big
client
wasn
t
their
responsibility
a
relic
of
the
vorstand
s
narrow
division
of

the
fact
that
one
arm
of
deutsche
refuse
to
do
business
with
trump
and
another
arm
consider
him
a
marquee

be
a
perfect
illustration
of
the
bank
s
dysfunction
it
be
obvious
one
board

would
lament
after

that
the

complain
without
much

about
the
lack
of
rigorous
financial
control
that

have
prevent
precisely
this
sort
of
situation
there
be
some
truth
to
the
report
conclusion
that
the
trump
relationship
be
the
product
of
organizational
disarray
but
that
masked
a
more
sober
problematic
reality
despite
not
see
the
official
exposure
report
quite
a
few
of
the

high

ackermann

more

they
d
know
about

reputation
for
demagogy
and

for
racism
and
recklessness
but
the
allure
of
quick

supersede
those
concern
now
the

be
pin
the
blame
for
the

on
a
roguish
american
outpost
and

in
the
week
after
the

hustle
to
devise
a
plan
one
immediate
step
be
to
reduce
the

a
decade
earlier

with
which
ackermann

at

the
big
problem
deutsche

conclude
be
the
fact
that
trump
have
give
his
personal
guarantee
on
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
of
outstanding

at
the

seem
like
the
safest
course
partly
shield
the

if

now
though
it
meant
that
the

deep
in
hock
to
a
foreign
institution
one
over
which
his

wield
enormous
power
one
possibility
be
to
just
let
trump
off
the
hook
for
his
personal
guarantee
the
loan
agreement
could
be
amend
to
delete
those
provision
and
then
it
would
be
the
trump
organization
not
trump
himself
that
owe
all
the
money
but
when
deutsche
s
discussion
about
that
idea
leak
the
outcry

swift
the

would
now
be
in

give
the

a
big

break

it

one

the

typical
plan
in
such
crisis
keep
quiet
downplay
the

everyone
get

constantly
about

do
you

val
deny
it

simpson
eyed
him
suspiciously
let
s
see
what
the
video
show
he
say
he
escort
val
into
his
office
flip
on

pull
up
a

off

simpson
didn
t
apologize
but
he
seem
to
relax
a
little
val
be
probably
not
a
spy
the
two
men
spent
the
next
several
day
together
they
talk
about
trump

their

val
confide
to

about
his

his
disappear
father
and
the
void
that

then
vacate
and
they
plow
through
more
of

by
now
simpson
have
copy
onto
his

simpson
hire
a

from

comb
through

too
the

have
left
the

year
earlier
angry
about
many
of
the
same
ethical
transgression
that
have
bother
broeksmit
not
least
the
derivative
that
have
help
torpedo
monte
dei
paschi
he
blame
the
bank
s
trouble
largely
on
the
reckless
management
style
of
anshu

army
he
have
vent
about
this
over
the
year
to

at
the

exchange
commission
and
the
new

which
be
apparently
how
he
have
appear
on
simpson
s
radar
now
he
be
a
fusion
contractor
the
auditor
have
work
alongside
broeksmit
at
time
in
the
past
include
when
he
be
try
to
rein
in
troy
dixon
and
he
found
it
a
little
creepy
now
to
be
paw
through
the
dead
man
s
email
his
desire
to
punish
deutsche
help
him
overcome
his
queasiness
he
eventually
found
something
interest
attach
to
one
of
the
email
chain
broeksmit
have
receive
in
advance
of
a
dbtca
board
meeting
be
an
excel
spreadsheet
to
an
untrained
eye
the
spreadsheet
look
meaningless
just
thousand
of
row
of
number
under
indecipherable
heading
but
the
auditor
s
eye
be
well
train
the
document
be
a
snapshot
as
of
october
of
dbtca
s
outstanding
exposure
to
hundred
of
financial
institution
how
much
deutsche
owe
them
and
how
much
they
owe
deutsche
it
be
no
secret
that
the
bank
do
extensive
business
with
most
of
the
world
s
big
bank
that
be
part
of
the
reason
that
the
imf
in
have
brand
the
company
as
the
world
s
most
systemically
dangerous
bank
but
what
jumped
out
at
the
auditor
as
he
scroll
through
this
spreadsheet
be
just
how
much
business
mostly
via
derivative
deutsche
have
be
do
with
russian
bank
there
be
ten
of
million
of
dollar
outstanding
with
vtb
alfa
bank
another
large
oligarch
control
russian
lender
be
on
deutsche
s
list
too
vtb
and
alfa
both
be
under
american
sanction
and
the
spreadsheet
show
that
a
network
of
more
obscure
company
like
russian
international
bank
and
russian
joint
stock
commercial
road
bank
and
russian
mortgage
bank
and
russian
commercial

cyprus
limited
to
name
a
few
also
be
do
ten
of
million
of
dollar
of
business
with

and
that
be
just
on
this
one
particular
day
that
the
spreadsheet
capture
in
the
fall
of

only
in
the
one
dbtca

be
no

how
much

on
other
day
and
in
other
part
of

the
spreadsheet
alone
didn
t
prove
anything
nefarious
there
wasn
t
enough
information
for
that
but
it
be
a
tantalize
clue
as
to
just
how
deeply
entangle
deutsche
be
with
russia
and
just
how
little
despite
everything
that
be
already
public
thanks
to
deutsche
s
repeat
scrape
with
western

enforcement
and

about
what
the

be
up
to
those
answer
lay
hidden
inside
deutsche
short
of

or
a
very
lucky
break
with
a
very
disgruntle
employee
the
only
way
to
crowbar
open
those
electronic
vault
be
for
a
government
body
to
issue
a
subpoena
simpson
and
fusion
didn
t
posse
such
authority
but
simpson
knew
some
powerful
people
and
now
he
sent
val
to
meet
them
after
nearly
twenty
year
work
for
the
senate
s
investigative
committee
bob
roach
have
switch
to
the
senate

committee
where
he
become
the

allegation
swirl
about

effort
to
skew
the
election
in
trump
s
favor
and
of
trump
s
supposedly
be
in
putin
s
clutch
one
thing
have
jumped
into
roach
s
mind
his
old
nemesis
deutsche
bank
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
bank
have
extensive
business
dealing
with
russia
and
those
dealing
include
act
as
a
conduit
for
dirty
money
to
get
out
of
the
country
and
into
the
western
financial
system
deutsche
of
course
be
the
only
reliable
connection
that
trump
his
family
and
his
company
have
to
the
mainstream
banking
world
and
eric
trump
have
blurt
that
russian
finance
the
family
s
golf
project
even
though
deutsche
have
make
the
doral
loan
perhaps
this
be
more
than
a
coincidence
maybe
deutsche
be
what
connect
trump
to
russia
the
rumor
that
have
be
ricochet
around
washington
new
york
and
london
be
that
vtb
have
in
the
recent
past
funnel
dirty
money
to
trump
via
deutsche
vtb
certainly
seem
connect
to
trump
felix
sater
who
have
once
rent
the
penthouse
suite
at
trump
s
wall
street
building
claimed
that
vtb
be
facilitate
travel
and
other
arrangement
for
the
future
president
s
team
in
as
they
discuss
a
possible
trump
tower
project
in
moscow
and
there
be
no
doubt
that
vtb
have
deep
long
stand
tie
to
deutsche
now
the
theory
be
that
one
of
the
reason
that
deutsche
have
be
willing
to
take
such
risk
on
loan
to
trump
be
that
it
wasn
t
actually
take
the
risk
at
all
vtb
have
agree
to
secure
the
loan
if
trump
default
deutsche
could
collect
whatever
it
be
owe
from
the
russian
bank
in
effect
that
meant
that
vtb
be
the
one
lending
to
trump
a
direct
financial
connection
between
the
russian
government
and
the
american
president
deutsche
executive
insist
this
be
false
but
that
didn
t
stop
the
rumor
from
spread
simpson
and
roach
have
know
each
other
for
nearly
two
decade
back
to
when
simpson
then
at
the
wall
street
journal
be
dig
into
offshore
shell
company
at
the
same
time
that
roach
be
investigate
tax
avoidance
both
men
be
rumple
and
indefatigable
and
accustom
to
be
underestimated
and
now
they
live
within
walk
distance
of
each
other
and
chat
regularly
in
february
simpson
suggest
that
roach
meet
val
and
peruse
his
father
s
file
roach
be
happy
to
oblige
it

have
rent
for
him
at
a
hotel
near
the

show
up
to
visit

at
the

hill
roach
still
have
the
rectangular
body
and
sharp
jaw
of
a
onetime
wrestler
now
he
have
add
a
flip
top
phone
and
a
bunch
of
cheesy
dad
joke
to
his
homespun
repertoire
he
lead
val
into
his
cramped
office
amid
tower
pile
of
binder
book
and
paperwork
roach
have
prepared
a
bundle
of
printout
for
val
news
article
and
other
material
about
deutsche
s
year
of
work
with
russian
oligarch
and
other
putin
crony
they
include
clipping
from
a
few
day
earlier
when
deutsche
have
be
penalize
by
british
and
new
york
regulator
for
the
russian
mirror
trading
scheme
after
agree
to
pay

to
settle
the
case
the
bank
point
at
tim
wiswell
who
have
be
fire
in
as
the
mastermind
of

told

that

be
look

they
spent
several
hour
at
a

huddle
over
val
s

val
struck
roach
as
hopelessly
scatterbrained
like
a
burn
out
hippie
but
the
investigator
be
experienced
in
deal
with
difficult
witness
guy
like
this
often
didn
t
realize
the
value
of
what
they
possess
and
the
trick
be
to
not
get
too
discourage
or
impatient
with
their
idiosyncrasy
that
even
after
a
short
senate

curiosity

pique
he
knew
what
the
natural
next
step
be
the
banking
committee
should
subpoena
deutsche
for
all
of
its
record
related
to
trump
but
there
be
no
way
that
any
of
the
republican
who
control
the
banking
committee
would
sign
off
on
a
subpoena
that

deutsche

perhaps
after

would
try

dispel
those
suspicion

as
month
pass
and
nothing
happen
executive
fear
fade
one
source
of

be
the

that
this
cripple

have
the
capacity
to
recover
albeit
in
a
much
small
form
after

unveiled
on

pleasant
sunday

it
call
for

exit
most

a

the

be
to
weed

anything

related
to
help
german
individual
and
european
company
do

the
hope
be
that
this
would
turn
out
to
be
at

modestly
profitable
it
be
sew

third

final
stab
at
craft
a

plan
for
the

join
as
a

thirty
year
earlier
back
in

anarchic
stampede
for
short

he
have
complain
to
hugo
b
nziger
that
the
bank
be
forget
its
heritage
and
then
resign
when
his
concern
fell
on
deaf
ear
now
sew
frame
his
vision
for
the
company
s
future
in
nostalgic
term
we
lose
our
compass
in
the
last
two
decade
he
confess
it
be
my
personal
purpose
to
connect
this
bank
with
what
it
use
to
be
give
deutsche
s
ugly
past
that
didn
t
inspire
much
confidence
in
the

future
