a

with

where

cheap
but
his

say
it
be
no
good
graham
be
so
take
aback
by
his
bos
s
opinion
that
he
never
bought
a
share
of
ibm
in
later
year
graham
would
say
that
ibm
have
brought
great
reward
to
shareholder
if
not
to
graham
perhaps
to
buffett
buffett
be
grant
secrecy
while
he
accumulate
his
massive
position
in
ibm
throughout
much
of
large
investor
who
do
not
want
to
be
copycatted
can
request
such
permission
ask
about
why
he
didn
t
buy
stock
in
microsoft
buffett
say
he
wouldn
t
do
that
because
he
s
friend
with
bill
gate
and
people
might
think
he
have
inside
information
all
along
ibm
have
bought
back
huge
amount
of
its
stock
demonstrate
confidence
in
its
own
strength
buffett
evidently
like
the
statement
that
make
technology
stock
for
buffett
over
the
year
buffett
have
famously
say
he
s
not
smart
enough
to
predict
future
earnings
of
technology
company
because
the
industry
change
so
much
buffett
have
recently
say
he
wish
he
have
study
technology
more
in
his
youth
do
this
now
mean
he
s
on
the
trail
of
tech
stock
probably
not
what
buffett
saw
in
ibm
be
akin
to
what
he
saw
in
his
big
purchase
two
decade
ago
of

loyal
customer
and
competent
management
in
his
early
day
buffett
pass
on
such
tech
stock
as
intel
but
then
he
also
avoid
many
tech
demise
buffett
s
sidekick
charles
munger
the
more
tech
savvy
of
the
two
men
have
comment
that
google
have
large
competitive
advantage
and
buffett
on
his
holiday
card
in
jokingly
ask
santa
for
google
as
a
company
he
d
like
to
buy
who
know
what
the
next
two

will
bring
for
now
ibm
be
the
pick
ibm
which
met

ibm
andrew
you
re
right
becky
wait
wait
a
second
ibm
be
a
tech
company
and
you
don
t
buy
tech
company
why
have
you
be
buying
ibm
buffett
well
i
didn
t
buy
railroad
company
for
a
long
time
either
i
it
s
interest
i
have
probably
i
ve
have
two
interest
incident
in
my
life
connect
with
ibm
but
i
ve
probably
read
the
annual
report
of
ibm
every
year
for
year
and
this
year
it
come
in
on
a
saturday
and
i
read
it
and
i
get
a
different
slant
on
it
which
i
then
proceed
to
do
some
check
out
of
but
i
just
i
read
it
through
a
different
lens
joe
what
s
the
different
lens
what
s
the
different
slant
buffett
well
just
like
just
like
i
do
with
just
like
i
do
with
the
railroad
and
incidentally
the
company
laid
it
out
extremely
well
i
don
t
think
there
s
any
company
that
s
that
i
can
think
of
big
company
that
s
do
a
well
job
of
lay
out
where
they
re
go
to
go
and
then
have
go
there
they
have
laid
out
a
road
map
and
i
should
have
paid
more
attention
to
it
five
year
ago
where
they
be
go
to
go
in
five
year
end
in
now
they
ve
laid
out
another
road
map
for
they
ve
do
an
incredible
job
first
lou
gerstner
when
he
come
in
he
save
the
company
from
bankruptcy
i
read
his
book
a
second
time
actually
after
i
read
the
annual
report
you
know
who
say
elephant
can
t
dance
i
read
it
when
it
first
come
out
and
then
i
go
back
and
reread
it
and
then
we
go
around
to
all
of
our
company
to
see
how
their
it
department
function
and
why
they
make
the
decision
they
make
and
i
just
come
away
with
a
different
view
of
the
position
that
ibm
hold
within
it
department
and
why
they
hold
it
and
the
stickiness
and
a
whole
bunch
of
thing
and
also
i
read
very
carefully
what
sam
palmisamo
joe
palmisano
becky
palmisano
buffett
palmisano
yes
have
say
about
where
they
re
go
to
be
and
he
s
deliver
big
time
on
his
on
his
on
his
first
venture
along
those
line
joe
incredible
buffett
but
anyway
we
joe
and
buffett
bought
about
million
share
and
it
cost
us
about
or
billion
joe
have
you
spent
time
with
sam
becky
what
do
that
mean
yeah
joe
unintelligible
becky
what
how
much
how
much
of
the
how
much
of
the
company
do
you
own
buffett
we
own
about
percent
of
the
company
becky
ok
joe
unintelligible
buffett
the
other
thing
i
would
say
about
ibm
too
be
that
a
few
year
back
they
have
million
option
outstanding
now
they
probably
be
down
to
about
million
they
treat
their
stock
with
reverence
which
i
find
be
unusual
among
big
company
or
they
really
they
be
think
about
the
shareholder
becky
we
joe
but

for
ibm

but
i
ve
never
i
have
not
talk
to
sam
or
now
ginni
joe
and
you
have
a
view
on
the
becky
wait
a
second
the
company
s
find
out
right
now
that
you
own
percent
of
the
company
by
buffett
yeah
yeah
yeah
becky
percent
by
you
talk
about
this
right
now
buffett
yeah
right
right
i
have
not
talk
to
the
company
joe
and
do
you
have
a
view
becky
we
ve
be
watch
the
stock
and
it
s
be
it
s
be
jumping
on
this
it
s
up
about
percent
right
now
i
ve
see
it
up
as
much
as
percent
would
you
continue
to
buy
more
buffett
yeah
no
i
wouldn
t
be
talk
about
it
if
we
weren
t
pretty
much
do
i
set
out
to
buy
about
billion
worth
and
we
bought
a
little
more
than
that
we
start
in
march
i
get
the
annual
report
i
think
very
early
in
march
and
then
i
do
some
work
and
then
we
start
we
bought
a
little
in
the
first
quarter
and
more
in
the
second
and
third
quarter
becky
i
buffett
and
we
and
we
bought
some
in
the
fourth
quarter
we
bought
some
in
the
our
report
that
we
will
file
tonight
will
not
show
the
whole
million
probably
show
million
or
something
like
that
because
we
bought
some
in
october
becky
because
you
bought
more
since
this
quarter
so
how
do
you
keep
that
hidden
that
you
re
buying
that
much
stock
over
that
long
of
a
period
of
time
buffett
i
avoid
talk
to
you
becky
no
really
how
do
you
how
do
you
hide
that
buffett
well
it
s
important
to
us
that
we
do
and
what
s
very
interest
be
here
in
a
what
be
it
seven
month
period
or
something
like
that
eight
month
maybe
we
buy
percent
of
the
company
at
the
same
time
the
company
bought
pretty
much
an
equal
amount
so
here
you
have
percent
of
a
huge
company
change
hand
and
all
kind
of
people
who
ve
own
ibm
forever
i
mean
it
s
an
old
it
s
an
old
company
it
s
a
big
company
it
s
amaze
to
me
how
much
turnover
there
be
in
stock
which
mean
that
you
know
investment
have
kind
of
go
by
the
board
and
people
just
basically
look
at
stock
as
thing
to
speculate
in
but
if
you
can
buy
percent
of
a
wonderful
company
in
eight
month
or
have
that
much
trade
just
the
two
buyer
without
of
course
who
know
how
much
we
affected
the
price
we
try
not
to
affect
the
price
we
usually
buy
a
give
percentage
of
what
trade
every
day
becky
you
this
be
the
second
time
in
the
last
several
month
that
you
ve
told
us
about
a
purchase
you
ve
make
of
a
company
you
ve
be
reading
the
annual
report
for
year
buffett
right
becky
bank
of
america
be
the
first
buffett
right
i
read
those
for
year

how
hard
it
be
to
compete
with
ibm
in
the
same
cnbc
interview
buffett
spoke
of
a
time
he
be
actually
in
competition
with
ibm
we
actually
start
i
be
the
chairman
of
the
board
believe
it
or
not
of
a
tech
company
one
time
and
computer
use
to
use
zillion
of
tab
card
and
ibm
in
or
sign
a
consent
decree
and
they
have
to
get
rid
of
half
the
capacity
so
two
friend
of
mine
one
be
a
lawyer
and
one
be
an
insurance
agent
read
the
newspaper
and
they
go
into
the
tab
card
business
and
i
go
in
with
them
and
we
do
a
terrific
job
and
built
a
nice
little
company
but
every
time
we
go
into
a
place
to
sell
them
our
tab
card
at
a
low
price
and
with
well
delivery
than
ibm
the
purchasing
agent
would
say
nobody
s
every
gotten
fire
from
buying
by
buying
from
ibm
i
mean
we
probably
heard
that
about
a
thousand
time
that
s
not
as
strong
now
but
i
imagine
as
you
go
around
the
world
that
there
be
there
s
a
fair
amount
of
presumption
in
many
place
that
if
you
re
with
ibm
that
you
stick
with
them
and
that
if
you
haven
t
be
with
anybody
you
re
develop
thing
that
you
certainly
give
them
a
fair
shot
at
the
business
and
i
think
they
ve
do
a
terrific
job

a

hero
who
inadvertently

bumbling

by

buffett
do
question

such
a
high

why
pay

for

worth

argue

buffett
told

that
if
it
be
not
pass
there
be
just
no
tell
what
would
happen
he
continued
last

we
be
at
the
brink
of
something
that
would
have
make
anything
that
s
happen
in
financial
history
look
pale
we
be
very
very
close
to
a
system
that
be
totally
dysfunctional
and
would
have
not
only
gum
up
the
financial
market
but
gum
up
the
economy
in
a
way
that
would
take
us
year
and
year
to
repair
we
ve
get
enough
problem
to
deal
with
anyway
i
m
not
say
the
paulson
plan
eliminates
those
problem
but
it
be
absolutely
and
be
absolutely
necessary
in
my
view
to
really
avoid
go
over
the
precipice
note
from
the
crisis
with
congress
bickering
over

urge
its

he
state
that

be
not
pass
the
nation
would
face
the
big
financial
meltdown
in

he
express
that
the
bailout
might
even
make
money
for
the

in
the
long
run
and
that
he
would
buy
damage

if
he
could
get

say
that
a
way

when
i
go

october
what
could
be

if

want
to

on
the

i
can
do
it
no
one
criticizes
someone
else
may
not
like
the

but
i
like
it
san
antonio
express
news
march
maybe
one
reason
buffett
bought
benjamin

in
be
because
he
need
more
hue
for
his

the

as

of

buffett
have
say
i
hope
it
s
an
example
in
some
way
of

that

might
emulate
over

sweep
nearly
priceless

buffett
have
be
call
the
prophet
of

the
sultan
of

indeed
he
be
the

the

berkshire

economics
represent

buffett
in

now
be
erect
supreme
corporate
gallery
all
this
be
reminiscent
of
the
adage
find
a
job
you
like
and
you
ll
never
work
a
day
in
your
life
it
be
true
that
berkshire
s
growth
slow
in
the
past
decade
more
or
less
to
s
p
level
although
berkshire
s
performance
appear
head
for
a
poor
year
in
it
still
outperform
the

and
the

at

berkshire
s

vies
with
almost
any
other
in
american
business
yet
buffett
ultrafamous
in
financial
circle
be
largely
unknown
until
he
step
in
to
save
the
wall
street
firm
of
salomon
brother
in
he
manages
one
of
america
s
large

from
a
small

in
a
nondescript

roughly
the

a

know
for
sensible
living
and
baseball
s
college
world
series
over
the
year
as
buffett
have
sat
in
the
office
reading
and
think
he
have
spawn
billion
of
dollar
in
shareholder
value
make
multimillionaires
of
dozen
of
early
investor
and
mere
millionaire
of
hundred
more
berkshire
s
stock
trade
high
than
any
other
stock
on
the
new

stock
exchange
and
sky
high
above
its
giveaway
price
of
that
day
back
in
on
the
date
that
buffett
take
over
berkshire
hathaway
may
its

stood
at
if
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
have
match
buffett
s
return
ever

the

have
end
april
not
at
its
actual
level
of
but
at
jason
zweig

july
so
how
do
buffett
multiply
his
money
by
more
than
time
less
in
light
of
in
little
more
than
half
a
century
since
he
form
the
buffett

in
for
one
thing
buffett
have
be
compound
thing
over
a
long

the
trick
to
building
a

be
to
start
at
the

of
the

he
say
even
so
for
most
investor
the
snow
melt
somewhere
along
the

here
s
what
buffett
have
do
that
keep
the
snow
accumulate
he
invests
in
only
a
few
sector
of
the
economy
we
like
simple
business
buffett
say
he
mean
plain
jane
business
in
which
extensive
product
change
be
not
expect
and
where
there
be
clear
competitive
advantage
not
much
research
and
development
occur
in
berkshire
s
business
they
exist
simply
to
make
a

a

mind
you

berkshire
it

when
it

it
be
necessary
not
to

simplicity
and

be
what
buffett
ferret
out
and
treasure
in
a
business
as
a
persistent
corporate
buyer
who
love
to
buy
and
hate
to
sell
buffett
tends
to
shy
away
from

saddle
with
large

and

of

technology
he
avoids
those

big

he
s
not
in

berkshire

there

hint
about

ibm

he

always

he
didn

need
it
recall
william

a
vice
president
of

who
have
be
an

in

make
the
strenuous
sale
to
buffett
it
be
an
ibm
standard
model
electric

he
bought
the
standard
model
rather
than
the
more
costly
executive
model
usually
tightfisted
buffett
have
occasionally
dipped
into
his
fortune
to
add
room
to
his
house
and
perhaps
his
big
splurge
a
handball
court
in
his
garage
and
home
entranceway
he
store
case
of
cherry

he
be
notorious
for
drinking
he
buy
the

himself
at
a
good
discount

at
a
time

about
one
tenth
of
a

he
drink
buffett
be
a
beacon
of
simplicity
and
sanity
a
prairie
genius
rationality
and
common
sense
actually
uncommon
sense
be
his
guide
light
for
example
he
bought
coca
cola
stock
for
many
reason
but
it
be
mainly
because
human
being
worldwide
get
thirsty
and
history
show
that
once
expose
to
coke
people
continue
to
drink
it
in
three
word
he
have
state
his
job
description
i
allocate
capital
he
have
also
provide
a
verbose
explanation
my
job
be
to
figure
out
which
business
to
invest
in
with
whom
and
at
what
price
he
recognizes
the
need
to
keep
the
manager
of
his
business
happy
they
all
make
high
salary
than
his
a
year
poor
old
buffett
hasn
t
see
a
pay
raise
since
three
fourth
of
the
manager
be
worth
more
than
million
so
they
be
financially
fit
already
still
it
doesn
t
seem
to
just
be
about
the
money
buffett
trust
them
and
step
out
of
their
way
in
line
with
teddy
roosevelt
s
advice
the
best
executive
be
one
who
have
sense
enough
to
pick
good
people
to
do
what
he
want
do
and
self
restraint
enough
to
keep
from
meddling
with
them
while
they
do
it
buffett
famously
dislike
full
schedule
meeting
company
ritual
and
manage
people
i
don
t
call
manager
of
my
business
he
have
say
they
call
me
every
couple
of
year
buffett
sends
his
manager
a
letter
of
less
than
two
page
that
essentially
say
they
should
run
their
business
as
if
they
own
it
and
they
should
continually
think
about
how
to
create
a
moat
around
their
business

be
personal

first
the

two
will

say
the

speak

say
to

you
re
look
at
a
fellow
who
owes
on
a
second
home
in

and
i
ve
get
that
because
of
the
low
rate
and
that
s
all
i
ve
owe
for
i
don
t
know
how
many
year
buffett
bought
another
home
in
laguna
right
behind
the
first
one
in
order
to
meet
the
need
of
an
ever
grow
family
later
he
sell
the
second
laguna
home
for
million
at
the
berkshire
annual
meeting
in
he
say
it
be
on
about
square
foot
of
land
maybe
a
th
of
an
acre
and
the
house
might
cost
about
if
you
want
to
replace
it
so
the
land
sell
for
something
like
million
an
acre
he

in

to
buffett
s

if
you

it

buffett
say
actually
buffett
s
aversion
to

in
some
sense
be
overstate
through
berkshire
he
s
happy
to
borrow
money
at
very
low
rate
or
at
no

at
all
indeed

of

in
stock
berkshire

to

berkshire
s
real
secret
be
that

account
where
the

in

work

berkshire
have
a
colossal
interest
free

in

a
rough
guess
have

maybe
instead
of
even
without

of

effect
on
his

result
while

what
berkshire
essentially
aim
to
do
be
borrow

a
berkshire

know
of

do
you

here
his
reply
be
we
don
t
need
any

just
ask
the

to
check
any
soft
fruit
at

buffett
described
berkshire
s
acquisition
policy
this
way
to

it
s
very
scientific
we
just
sit
around
and
wait
for
the
phone
to
ring
sometimes
it
s
a
wrong
number
buffett
life
an
extraordinarily
simple
life
and
say
of
what
he
have
will
be
return
to

indeed
buffett
have
say
he
ll
leave
the
bulk
of
this
fortune
to

before

buffett
have
offer
his
trustee
insight
into
how
he
would
like
his
fund
distribute
back
to

i
want
my
trustee
to
swing
for
the
fence
on
a
few
project
that
do
not
have
natural
funding
constituency
but
that
be
important
to
society
i
tell
them
that
if
they
start
give
half
a
million
to
this
hospital
and
half
a
million
to
that
college
i
will
come
back
and
haunt
them
but
if
they
spend
a

of

on
something

that
we
would
this

write
a
tribute
to
his
aunt

which
be
include
in
the

katie
be
like
a
second
mother
to
me
on
financial
matter
i
could
put
her
mind
at
ease
and
in
the
later
year
we
developed
a
routine
it
s
very
common
for
old
people
to
worry
about
run
out
of
money
no
matter
what
their
financial
condition
in
this
respect
katie
would
write
me
sometimes
in
a
manner
as
follow
from
an
actual
communication
on
january
i
get
concerned
with
my
add
health
expense
about
have
enough
to
take
care
of
myself
be
this
a
foolish
concern
thank
you
for
all
you
ve
do
for
me
love
you
katie
my
usual
response
to
her
be
katie
you
re
absolutely
right
if
you
keep
spending
at
the
present
rate
and
live
for
another
year
you
be
go
to
be
broke
she
would
laugh
about
this
and
then
rephrase
the
question
another
six
month
or
so
later
it
be
a
mathematical
truism
that
katie
could
never
run
out
of
money
but
it
be
an
equal
truism
that
she
never
ran
out
of
love
to
share
with
others

weekly

have
invite
reader
to
comment
on
how
they
use
the
market
laboratory
of
the
letter
sent
several
include
buffett
s
be
print
in
the
december
issue
the
writer
of
the
column
arnold
corrigan
note
that
a
full
explanation
of
odd
lot
trading
have
come
in
from
mr
warren
buffett
of
omaha
among
the
more
interest
statistic
that
you
publish
be
the
figure
for
member
trading
and
odd
lot
trading
these
two
group
characteristically
show
a
tendency
to
be
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
fence
that
be
when
the
member
be
buying
on
balance
the
odd
lot
trader
have
a
sell
balance
and
vice
versa
the
odd
lot
figure
must
be
modify
to
reflect
a
tendency
for
a
long
term
buying
balance
due
to
small
investor
put
away
a
few
share
of
investment
stock
from
time
to
time
therefore
the
trend
of
relationship
between
odd
lot
buying
and
sell
be
more
important
than
the
actual
balance
when
the
odd
lot
trader
have
become
increasingly
bullish
in
a
rise
market
or
increasingly
bearish
in
a
decline
market
it
have
generally
be
advantageous
to
expect
his
change
of
sentiment
to
be
wrong
a
recent
example
be
the
increase
bearishness
of
the
public
from
january
to
june
as
the
market
irregularly
decline
to
the
level
from
which
point
it
then
climbed
steadily
from
a
logical
point
of
view
the
theory
seem
to
be
valid
since
an
unsuccessful
trader
in
stock
eventually
find
his
capital
reduce
to
the
point
where
he
be
force
to
trade
either
in
penny
issue
or
in
odd
lot
on
the
other
hand
a
small
successful
trader
will
soon
accrue
enough
profit
to
graduate
to
the
round
lot
class
the
other
side
of
the
picture
be
represent
by
the
member
trading
statistic
these
reflect
the
trading
of
men
whose
business
center
about
the
fluctuation
of
stock
it
should
be
expect
that
this
group
as
a
whole
will
trade
profitably
although
some
of
its
member
naturally
may
fail
to
do
so
the
rise
in
the
market
that
begin
in
june
of
could
have
be
foretold
by
a
study
of
the
member
trading
activity
the
member
trading
balance
have
be
slightly
on
the
sell
side
through
the
early
part
of
but
during
the
late
spring
and
summer
their
purchase
begin
exceed
their
sale
by
large
margin
often
as
much
as
share
a
week
although
some
of
this
undoubtedly
reflect
purchase
of
commonwealth
southern
for
its
breakup
potentiality
it
be
still
apparent
that
there
be
a
decide
change
in
market
sentiment
on
the
part
of
the
exchange
member
a
change
just
opposite
to
that
of
the
odd
lot
public
the
member
prove
to
be
correct
in
their
judgment
while
the
odd
lot
trader
be
as
usual
switch
to
the
wrong
side
no
attempt
should
be
make
to
read
too
much
into
these
set
of
data
minor
fluctuation
will
constantly
occur
that
be
incapable
of
analysis
however
when
divergent
trend
of
the
two
group
have
appear
it
have
proven
profitable
to
trade
on
the
side
of
the
member
and
against
the
odd
lotter
here
s
what
buffett
be
think
on
december
accord
to
his
letter
to
barron
s
to
the
editor
i
have
just
finish
reading
your
article
regard
publicly
own
real
estate
company
which
be
most
interest
and
perceptive
this
be
a
story
that
need
to
be
told
an
item
fully
as
important
as
the
lack
of
quantitative
coverage
of
dividend
may
well
turn
out
to
be
the
dubious
quality
of
the
income
of
many
of
these
company
whereas
it
be
somewhat
difficult
in
many
case
to
determine
this
quality
there
be
certain
know
instance
which
literally
shout
for
disclosure
and
i
think
there
be
reason
to
believe
that
continued
probe
would
develop
still
more
instance
to
give
you
an
example
of
the
sort
of
thing
i
have
in
mind
let
me
cite
two
instance
to
which
you
refer
from
the
kratter
corp
prospectus
of
prepared
in
connection
with
the
debenture
issue
which
never
materialize
on
page
of
the
red
herring
prospectus
reference
be
make
to
container
under
lease
to
f
m
schafer
brewing
co
these
container
be
purchase
by
a
joint
venture
in
august
for
and
immediately
net
lease
back
to
the
brewery
for
five
year
at
annually
what
this
really
amount
to
of
course
be
a
financing
transaction
for
the
brewing
company
however
the
impression
the
public
stockholder
get
be
that
this
comingled
with
other
operating
income
from
real
estate
have
the
same
quality
and
expect
longevity
that
might
be
expect
from
a
first
class
office
building
therefore
if
the
casual
stockholder
take
the
and
capitalizes
it
at
he
immediately
attribute
a
value
of
almost
million
to
something
which
initially
only
have
a
value
of
and
whose
value
be
decline
at
an
extreme
rate
various
brokerage
office
have
issue
report
involve
just
this
sort
of
valuation
this
would
appear
to
be
trading
upon
the
low
level
of
intelligence
in
wall
street
on
the
same
page
in
the
red
herring
reference
be
make
to
various
machine
acquire
from
dashew
business
machine
and
under
lease
either
to
standard
oil
of
california
or
dashew
itself
there
be
two
arrangement
here
but
suffice
to
say
that
the
eight
machine
lease
to
dashew
be
purchase
for
in
august
and
lease
back
for
five
year
for
per
annum
with
the
subsequent
five
year
available
to
dashew
at
per
annum
anyone
assume
that
the
which
be
contribute
just
that
much
to
the
current
operating
income
of
kratter
have
the
aspect
of
long
term
prime
real
estate
income
be
due
for
a
real
shock
when
the
renewal
period
come
up
this
sort
of
transaction
be
very
similar
to
buying
a
royalty
on
a
short
live
oil
well
if
the
gross
receipt
be
spent
each
year
one
soon
find
out
that
the
capital
be
not
self
replace
to
ignore
the
concept
of
amortization
or
depreciation
on
such
transaction
be
dubious
if
not
fraudulent
i
think
you
have
do
a
real
public
service
in
take
a
good
hard
look
at
the
advanced
accounting
technique

it
have
many

howard

soon
found
another
job
and
his
fortune
quickly
recover
but
it
be
still
a
sear
experience
for
the

those
time
of

calculation
particularly
when

blistering
pace
be
a
pastime
that
absorbed
him
from

early
day
as
a
child
he
be
so
cautious
he
walk
with
his
knee
bent
so
he
wouldn
t
have
too
far
to
fall
but
as
an
adult
he
be
capable
of
grand
gesture
it
be
a
broad
stroke
doris
buffett
say
decade
after
buffett
purchase
billion
of
coke
stock
it
be
surprising
then
that
one
of
young

s
first
real
business
venture
be
in
soft
drink

for
a
six

of
coke
and
sell
it
for
five

a
bottle
warren
always
have
a
fascination
for
number
in
connection
with
earn
money
doris
buffett
recall
those
return
have
remain
pretty
consistent
throughout
buffett
s
entire
business
career
hence
his
multi
billionaire
status
buffett
also
bought
coca
cola
from
his
grandfather
s
grocery
store
in
omaha
and
sell
it
to
neighbor
in
buffett
s
letter
to
the
shareholder
of
berkshire
hathaway
buffett
write
of
his
early
coca
cola
experience
i
believe
i
have
my
first
coca
cola
in
either
or
of
a
certainty
it
be
in
that
i
start
buying
coke
at
the
rate
of
six
for
cent
from
buffett
son
the
family
grocery
store
to
sell
around
the
neighborhood
for
cent
each
in
this
excursion
into
high
margin
retailing
i
duly
observe
the
extraordinary
consumer
attractiveness
and
commercial
possibility
of
the
product
at
age
buffett
reportedly
ask
santa
claus
for
a
book
about
bond
when
buffett
be
year
old
he
begin
reading
his

s
book
on
the
stock
market
that
he
found
around
the
house
he
say
he
become
interested
in
stock
when
he
be
or
and
i
ve
always
be
upset
that
i
didn

be
pepsi
he
later
explain
to
berkshire
shareholder
paul
cassidy
of
north
andover
massachusetts
i
originally
start
on
the
pepsi
because
at
the
time
pepsi
come
in
ounce
bottle
and
coke
come
in
ounce
bottle
and
the
price
be
the
same
that
be
a
pretty
powerful
argument
by
the
time
he
be
he
have
checked
out
every
investment
book
from
his
local
library

number
family
member
have
say
buffett
s
recall
for
number
an
important
aptitude
for
any
businessman
may
have
come
from
both
parent
his
father
be
a
stockbroker
and
his
mother
calculate
number
well
while
most
youngster
be
content
to
get
soda
out
of
machine
and
never
give
thing
a
far
thought
buffett
be
retrieve
the
discard
bottle
cap
from
soda
pop
machine
sort
and
counting
them
to
find
out
which
soda

be
really
sell
say
early

irving
fenster
from
tulsa
oklahoma
a
berkshire
shareholder
buffett
s
instinct
as
an
auditor
the
ability
to
get
at
the
real
number
not
the
suppose
number
pass
along
by
others
remains
one
of
his
trademark
he
have
never
rely
on
traditional
wisdom
after
all
he
say
traditional
wisdom
can
be
long
on
tradition
and
short
on
wisdom
ahead
of
the
rest
the
precocious
youngster
memorize
all
sort
of
number
from
the
number
of
bottle
cap
to
statistic
on
baseball
card
to
license
plate
to
the
number
of
car
that
pass
his
house
he
could
spout
off
the

of

egghead
than
as
an
athlete
he
like
to
open

think
my
seven
year

this
way
i
slept
in

bedroom
of
the
house
where
there
be
mound
of
copy
of

i
think
i
read
every
one
of

when
i
be
in
my
mid
twenty
i
become
an
investor
in
butterick
corp
a

that
somewhat
incongruously
be
in
the
dual

the
progressive
grocer
and
sell
pattern
to
woman
for

leonard
tingle
be
the

of

and
i
told
him
my
youth
have
be
influence
by
reading
his
magazine
rather
than
popular
mechanic
in
june
buffett
rejoin
his
family
in
fredericksburg
but
return
to
omaha
for
much
of
the
summer
stay
at
a

while
its

in

the

d
c
to

a
few
year
later
congressman
richard
nixon
move
into
the
area
congressman
buffett
be
such
a
straight
arrow
and
fiscal
conservative
that
he
once
return
a
annual
pay
raise
from
to
to
the
united
state

buffett
a
crew
cut
lad
in
those
day
go
back
and
forth
from
omaha
to
washington
so
much
that
one
retire
executive
in
omaha
recall
that
back
then
buffett
be
like
a
phantom
when
he
be
buffett
ran
away
briefly
from
his
washington
d
c
home
to
hershey
pennsylvania
he
ran
away
with
a
friend
roger
bell
i
think
they
be
picked
up
by
the
police
his
sister
doris
buffett
recall
buffett
s
escapade
have
to
be
a
little
business
related
of
course
buffett
told
atlanta
constitution
business
writer
melissa
turner
that
he
bell
and
another
friend
have
the
idea
of
earn
a
little
money
caddy
at
a
local
golf
course
he
also
have
the
idea
of
tour
the
hershey
s
chocolate
plant
and
get
a
free
candy
bar
but
he
didn
t
tour
the
plant
and
apparently
didn
t
consider
buying
the
company
it
wasn
t
long
before
the
police
sent
him
home
when
turner
ask
him
if
he
might
sample
hershey
stock
some
day
he
reply
i
ve
driven
a
car
all
my
life
but
i
haven
t
bought
any
car
company
still
buffett
often
mention
the
attribute
of
hershey
when
he
get
go
about
the
concept
of
consumer
franchise
he
explains
that
consumer
franchise
or
name
brand
such
as
coca
cola
gillette
and
wrigley
have
extra
value
a
valuable
consumer
franchise
exists
he
say
when
people
prefer
a
certain
brand
name
so
much
that
they
would
pay
extra
even
walk
out
of
the
store
they
re
in
and
go
across
the
street
just
to
buy
the
well
brand
even
if
another
chocolate
bar
be
five
cent
cheaper
one
be
still
likely
to
choose
the
hershey
name
in
washington
buffett
attend
alice

junior
high
school
where
his
grade
be
poor
they
improve
only
when
his
father
threaten
to
take
away
his
cherished
paper

while
still
buffett
begin
pay
tax
on
an
income
of
he
earn
from
newspaper
route
still
rebellious
and
look
for
his
place
in
the
world
buffett
once
again
pounce
on
his
main
passion
business
he
undertook
a
series
of
financial
venture
include
retrieve
lose
golf
ball
at
a
country
club
in

but
his
main

be
be
an
industrious
newspaper

at
one
point
deliver

buffett
be
once
ask
about
his
early
determination
to
be
rich
i
want
enough
money
so
i
could
do
what
i
want

when
i
be
a
kid
i
enjoy
deliver

and
while
do
that
i
like
be
able
to
think
about
thing
the
mirror
may
think
he
could
well
use
the
time
to
collect
from
his
customer
he
developed
an
effective
scheme
for
sell
magazine

he
would
tear
the

with
the

date
from

file

at
the

eugene
meyer
would
later
merge
the
post
and
time
herald
into
a
large
successful
newspaper
buffett
would
one
day
make
an
investment
in
the
post
an
enormously
successful
move
that
vault
him
to
the
top
rank
of
investor
buffett
be
always
fascinate
by
the
stock
market
recall
doris
buffett
i
never
have
any
doubt
i
never
knew
it
would
amount
to
this
but
even
back
then
everyone
recognize
he
knew
about
the
stock
market
even
at
or
buffett
knew
all
the
stock
but
say
he
didn
t
know
what
be
behind
them
buffett
be
constantly
run
calculation
in
his
head
in
church
he
calculate
the
life
span
of
the
composer
of
hymn
check
to
see
if
their
religious
call
reward
them
with
extra
longevity
his
conclusion
no
although
young
warren
be
a
math
prodigy
his
fascination
with
finance
come
as
a
surprise
to
buffett
s
religious
and
frugal
father
who
have
little
interest
in
amass
money
for
its
own
sake
he
found
his
son
whom
he
hop
would
one
day
join
the
clergy
spellbound
by
the
power
of
the
almighty
dollar
but
buffett
could
not
ultimately
make
the
leap
to
religious
faith
rationality
fact
number
and
money
be
what
matter
to
him
perhaps
that
be
the
reason
buffett
settle
on
be
an
agnostic
buffett
say
i
be
an
agnostic
that
s
the
person
who
say
i
m
not
an
atheist
thank
god
financial
time
may
buffett
have
say
he
decide
on
agnosticism
because
he
doubt
the
human
mind
can
know
whether
there
be
a
god
but
say
about
his
religious
father
as
a
practical
matter
i
think
my
dad
and
i
come
out
at
about
the
same
place
in
term
of
what
we
believe
behavior
should
be
and
how
society
should
operate
he
have
also
say
in
my
whole
life
i
never
saw
my
dad
or
my
wife
ever
do
anything
in
their
life
you
couldn
t
put
on
the
front
page
of
a
newspaper
write
by
an
unfriendly
reporter
omaha
world
herald
february
from
a
talk
to
midland
college
business
student
someone
once
say
i
use
to
be
an
agnostic
but
now
i
m
not
so
sure
it
s
a
little
like
ronald
reagan
s
comment
about
his
father
my
father
give
up
go
to
church
for
lent
peggy
noonan
when
character
be
king
p
buffett
s
agnosticism
extends
to
economic
forecasting
and
he
certainly
would
endorse
former
stanford
business
professor
ezra
solomon
s
view
the
only
function
of
economic
forecasting
be
to
make
astrology
look
respectable
money
doesn
t
talk
it
swears
buffett
didn
t
say
it
bob
dylan
do
money
doesn
t
talk
it
swears
some
robust
men
be
call
to
the
sea
and
others
explore
antarctica
buffett
journeyed
into
the
world
of
finance
and
conquer
it
buffett
s
path
to
success
seem
analogous
to
charles
lindbergh
s
first
flight
after
a
particularly
undistinguished
youth
indeed
lindbergh
have
recently
flunk
out
of
college
a
scott
berg
author
of
lindbergh
p
write
when
the
plane
take
flight
and
bank
for
the
first
time
lindbergh
felt
as
though
he
have
lose
all
conscious
connection
with
the
past
that
he
live
only
in
the
moment
in
the
strange
immortal
space
crowd
with
beauty
pierce
with
danger
others
like
steve
wozniak
the
inventor
of
the
personal
computer
be
a
bit
more
prosaic
finally
i
give
up
and
just
popped
in
the
other
two
prom
the
one
with
the
polling
version

benjamin

s
the

which
preach

that
meant

the

company
whose
intrinsic
value
be
substantially
great
than
the

the

assigns
to
the
enterprise
a

worth
its
true
intrinsic
value
in
the
real

world
the
goal
be
to
buy
stock
sell
at
a
good
discount
to
the
transactional
value
of
the

of

key
business
belief

it

businesslike
that

buffett
say
later
as
a
teacher
graham
encourage
investor
to
pay
attention
to
intrinsic
business
value
what
a
reasonable
businessman
would
pay
he
once
say
the
investor
s
bad
enemy
be
likely
to
be
himself
also
an
investor
should
keep
in
mind
a
margin
of
safety
meaning
be
sure
the
business
you
re
buying
be
worth
significantly
more
than
you
pay
for
it
in
the
stock
market
only
price
and
value
count
buffett
would
later
say
the
word
margin
of
safety
be
the
three
most
important
word
in
invest
maybe
graham
come
by
this
important
invest
concept
from
mark
twain
who
use
the
margin
of
safety
phrase
when
talk
about
navigate
a
steamboat
on
the
mississippi
in
life
on
the
mississippi
many
item
be
to
be
consider
before
invest
integrity
of
management
competitive
position
and
durability
of
the
franchise
as
well
as
price
on
the
issue
of
price
these
be
among
the
holy
word
of
ben
graham
that
so
capture
buffett
the
margin
of
safety
idea
becomes
most
evident
when
we
apply
it
to
the
field
of
undervalue
or
bargain
security
we
have
here
by
definition
a
favorable
difference
between
price
on
the
one
hand
and
indicate
or
appraise
value
on
the
other
that
difference
be
the
safety
margin
it
be
available
for
absorb
the
effect
of
miscalculation
or
bad
than
average
luck
the
buyer
of
bargain
issue
place
particular
emphasis
on
the
ability
of
the
investment
to
withstand
adverse
development
for
in
most
such
case
he
have
no
real
enthusiasm
about
the
company
s
prospect
true
if
the
prospect
be
definitely
bad
the
investor
will
prefer
to
avoid
the
security
no
matter
how
low
the
price
but
the
field
of
undervalue
issue
be
drawn
from
the
many
concern
perhaps
a
majority
of
the
total
for
which
the
future
appear
neither
distinctly
promising
nor
distinctly
unpromising
if
these
be
bought
on
a
bargain
basis
even
a
moderate
decline
in
the
earn
power
need
not
prevent
the
investment
from
show
satisfactory
result
the
margin
of
safety
will
then
have
serve
its
proper
purpose
benjamin

james

download
the

word
for
word
forever
into
his
brain
once
when
he
testify
in
the
ibm
antitrust
case
an
ibm
lawyer
say
buffett
have
contradict
a
paragraph
in

counter
that
the
lawyer

the
third
edition
which
have
additional
contributor
and
that
the
paragraph
be
not
in
the
first
edition
which
reflect
only
the
work
of
graham
and
dodd
the
new
york
time
june
buffett
have
always
recommend
the
intelligent
investor
as
require
reading
for
any
successful
investor
he
have
cite
in
particular
chapter
about
investor
attitude
toward
an
erratic
unpredictable
stock
market
and
chapter
on
margin
of
safety
about
buying
at
bargain
price
to
be
among
the
most
important
piece
of
investment
advice
ever
write
and
that
the
true
investor
take
advantage
of
stock
price
when
they
become
silly
in
either
direction
and
he
buy
at
a
good
price
compare
to
real
business
value
chapter
say
when
approach
the
stock
market
you
should
imagine
you
re
in
business
with
mr
market
but
you
have
to
watch
him
because
he
let
his
enthusiasm
and
fear
run
away
with
him
the
chapter
state
the
significance
of
fluctuation
in
stock
price
basically
price
fluctuation
have
only
one
significant
meaning
for
the
true
investor
they
provide
him
with
an
opportunity
to
buy
wisely
when
price
fall
sharply
and
to
sell
wisely
when
they
advance
a
great
deal
at
other
time
he
will
do
well
if
he
forgets
about
the
stock
market
and
pay
attention
to
his
dividend
return
and
to
the
operating
result
of
his
company
chapter
discus
a
favorable
difference
in
price
on
the
one
hand
and
an
indicate
or
appraise
value
on
the
other
state
that
difference
be
the
margin
of
safety
therefore
the
margin
of
safety
depends
on
the
price
paid
excellent
price
come
with
poor
market
money
manager
chris
davis
be
fond
of
say
you
make
your
money
in
a
down
market
it
just
doesn
t
seem
like
it
at
the
time
the
lesson
of
value
invest
be
later
reinforce
by
ben
graham
who
taught
that
whether
someone
else
agrees
or
disagrees
with
you
do
not
make
you
right
or
wrong
that
hallmark
idea
never
left
buffett
who
in
word
it
this
way
in
a
correspondence
with
member
of
the
buffett
partnership
we
derive
no
comfort
because
important
people
vocal
people
or
great
number
of
people
agree
with
us
nor
do
we
derive
comfort
if
they
don
t
a
public
opinion
poll
be
no
substitute
for
thought
buffett
add
that
when
you
find
a
situation
you
understand
where
the
fact
be
ascertainable
and
clear
then
you
act
whether
the
action
be
conventional
or
unconventional
and
regardless
of
whether
others
agree
or
disagree
when
you
be
dead
sure
of
something
and
be
arm
with
all
the
fact
then
everyone
else
s
advice
be
only
confuse
and
time
consume
when
almost
everyone
be
dismiss
the
newspaper
business
as
unappealing
in
the
s
buffett
spot
its
monopoly
like
franchise
and
bought
one
medium
stock
after
another
from
his
early
day
buffett
have
rarely
show
his
hand
the
practice
would
take
on
far
great
significance
later
when
wall
street
would
try
to
guess
what
he
be
do
only
rarely
do
his
move
in
the
market
leak
out
to
this
day
buffett
try
to
keep
his
investment
secret
until
publication
of
the
berkshire
annual
report
each
march
yet
buffett
have
say
it
s
not
easy
to
keep
secret
especially
when
talk
to
attractive
woman
buffett
s
academic
record
be
one
of
the
best
ever
at
columbia
business
school
where
he
earn
a
master
in
economics
in
june
at
the
time
graham
be
teach
buffett
graham
be
say
to
have
believe
young
buffett
would
become
the
great
financial
mind
of
his
time
buffett

indeed
it
be
say
that
buffett

on
a

there

then
and
look
like
i
could

into
a
basketball
game
as
a
high
school
student
the
moment
buffett
begin

however
the

a
prolong
slide
and
buffett
bought
its
unimpressive
operation
for
a
proverbial
song
despite
hard
work
and
new
management
the
textile
operation
never
paid
off
berkshire
would
become
one
of
the
few
business
that
never

of
struggle
to
keep
it
afloat
he
sell
it
for

in

determine
that
he
could
no

find
real

highly
successful
partnership
after

of

buffett

buffett
at
the
time
write
his

be
out

with
present
condition
when
the
game
be
no
longer
played
your
way
it
be
only
human
to
say
the
new
approach
be
all
wrong
bound
to
lead
to
trouble
and
so
on
on
one
point
however
i
be
clear
i
will
not
abandon
a
previous
approach
whose
logic
i
understand
although
i
find
it
difficult
to
apply
even
though
it
may
mean
forego
large
and
apparently
easy
profit
to
embrace
an
approach
which
i
don
t
fully
understand
have
not
practice
successfully
and
which
possibly
could
lead
to
substantial
permanent
loss
of
capital
he
then
distribute

benjamin
graham

several
year
ago
ben
graham
then
almost
express
to
a
friend
the
thought
that
he
hop
to
do
every
day
something
foolish
something
creative
and
something
generous
the
inclusion
of
that
first
whimsical
goal
reflect
his
knack
for
packaging
idea
in
a
form
that
avoid
any
overtone
of
sermonize
or
self
importance
although
his
idea
be
powerful
their
delivery
be
unfailingly
gentle
reader
of
this
magazine
need
no
elaboration
of
his
achievement
as
measure
by
the
standard
of
creativity
it
be
rare
that
the
founder
of
a
discipline
do
not
find
his
work
eclipse
in
rather
short
order
by
successor
but
over
year
after
publication
of
the
book
that
brought
structure
and
logic
to
a
disorderly
and
confuse
activity
it
be
difficult
to
think
of
possible
candidate
for
even
the
runner
up
position
in
the
field
of
security
analysis
in
an
area
where
much
look
foolish
within
week
or
month
after
publication
ben
s
principle
have
remain
sound
their
value
often
enhance
and
well
understood
in
the
wake
of
financial
storm
that
demolish
flimsier
intellectual
structure
his
counsel
of
soundness
brought
unfailing
reward
to
his
follower
even
to
those
with
natural
ability
inferior
to
more
gift
practitioner
who
stumble
while
follow
counsel
of
brilliance
or
fashion
a
remarkable
aspect
of
ben
s
dominance
of
his
professional
field
be
that
he
achieve
it
without
that
narrowness
of
mental
activity
that
concentrate
all
effort
on
a
single
end
it
be
rather
the
incidental
by
product
of
an
intellect
whose
breadth
almost
exceed
definition
certainly
i
have
never
met
anyone
with
a
mind
of
similar
scope
virtually
total
recall
unending
fascination

knowledge
and
an
ability
to
recast
it
in
a
form
applicable
to
seemingly
unrelated
problem
make
exposure
to
his
think
in
any
field
a
delight
but
his
third
imperative
generosity
be
where
he
succeed
beyond
all

ben
as
my

in

just

a

thinker
he
have
high
ethical
standard
and
be
modest
and
unassuming
he
be
one
of
a
kind
i
work
for
him
for
nearly
year
as
a
security
analyst
in
re
reading
the
preface
to
the
first
edition
of
security
analysis
i
be
impressed
all
over
again
with
ben
s
view
i
quote
we
be
concerned
chiefly
with
concept
method
standard
principle
and
above
all
with
logical
reason
we
have
stress
theory
not
for
itself
alone
but
for
its
value
in
practice
we
have
try
to
avoid
prescribe
standard
which
be
too
stringent
to
follow
or
technical
method
which
be
more
trouble
than
they
be
worth
security
analysis
say
it
all
it
be
up
to
analyst
and
investor
to
put
ben
s
idea
into
practice
back
in
while
work
at
loeb
rhodes
then
call
carl
m
loeb
co
one
of
the
partner
armand
erpf
give
a
good
piece
of
advice
when
i
ask
him
how
i
could
get
into
the
statistical
department
in
those
day
and
perhaps
today
to
some
extent
the
best
way
to
advance
be
by
bring
in

if
you
have
wealthy
family
or
friend
you
brought
in
commission
security
analysis
be
in
its
infancy
and
who
you
knew
be
much
more
important
than
what
you
knew
if
you
didn
t
have
connection
it
be
difficult
to
get
ahead
in
any
case
mr
erpf
told
me
that
there
be
a
new
book
call

analysis
that
have
just
be
write
by
a

when
you
know
everything
in
it
you
won
t
have
to
read
anything
else

new

ben
be
a
good
speaker
enthusiastic
and
logical
ben
do
something
that
i
haven
t
see
do
often
he
would
take
an
undervalue
situation
at
that
time
such
as
the
bankrupt
bond
of
baldwin
locomotive
and
show
how
much
the
new
security
would
be
worth
base
on
their
project
earn
power
and
asset
and
relate
this
to
the
price
of
the
bond
many
bright
wall
streeters
such
as
gu
levy
of
goldman
sachs
who
later
become
the
top
arbitrageur
in
the
country
use
to
take
his
course
i
often
wonder
how
much
money
people
make
on
ben
s
idea
by
transform
them
into
investment
ben
be
very
generous
with
his
thought
and
his
time
particularly
with
young
people
by
offering
me
a
job
as
his
security
analyst
as
i
be
about
to
leave
the
army
at
the
end
of
he
change
my
life
i
know
he
help
others
in
our
field
too
at
ben
s
memorial
service
dave
dodd
ben
s
co
author
told
how
he
become
involve
in
the
book
it
seem
that
ben
be
ask
to
teach
a
course
at
columbia
university
on
investment
and
he
agree
to
do
it
with
the
stipulation
that
he
would
only
do
so
if
someone
would
take
note
dave
dodd
a
young
instructor
volunteer
and
take
copious
note
at
each
of
ben
s
lecture
ben
use
the
note
then
go
ahead
and
write
security
analysis
as
dave
say
ben
do
the
work
but
he
insist
that
dave
get
credit
by
be
co
author
professor
dodd
go
on
to
become
a
very
successful
investor
and
a
director
of
graham
newman
corporation
an
investment
trust
that
ben
have
found
in
with
his
partner
jerome
newman
the
ability
to
think
clearly
in
the
investment
field
without
the
emotion
that
be
attach
to
it
be
not
an
easy
undertaking
fear
and
greed
tend
to
affect
one
s
judgment
because
ben
be
not
really
very
aggressive
about
make
money
he
be
less
affected
by
these
emotion
than
be
many
others
ben
have
be
hurt
by
the
depression
so
he
want
to
invest
in
thing
that
would
protect
him
on
the
downside
the
best
way
to
do
this
be
to
lay
out
rule
which
if
follow
would
reduce
his
chance
of
loss
a
good
example
of
this
be
the
day
i
happen
to
be
in
his
office
at
graham
newman
when
he
receive
a
telephone
call
that
they
have
bought
percent
of
government
employee
insurance
co
now
geico
he
turn
to
me
and
say
walter
if
this
purchase
doesn
t
work
out
we
can
always
liquidate
it
and
get
our
money
back
the
fact
that
geico
work
out
well
than
his
wild
dream
wasn
t
what
he
be
look
for
as
the
say
go
a
stock
well
bought
be
half
sell
i
think
ben
be
an
expert
in
that
area
graham
newman
follow
the
precept
set
down
by
ben
and
the
fund
prosper
compare
to
today
s
investment
company
it
be
tiny
its
total
net
asset
on
january
be
ben
s
emphasis
be
on
protect
his
expectation
of
profit
with
minimum
risk
if
one
want
to
get
hold
of
moody

that

on
the

to
the
field
its
fourth
revise
edition
be
still
in
print
one
day
i
come
across
a
very
cheap
stock
base
on
its
price
at
the
time
lukens
steel
we
bought
some
but
expect
to
buy
more
at
this
point
ben
go
out
to
lunch
with
a
man
who
kept
tell
ben
about
one
blue
chip
after
another
at
the
end
of
the
meal
he
ask
ben
if
he
like
anything
and
ben
say
we
be
buying
some
lukens
steel
i
doubt
if
it
take
a
day
before
the
man
go
out
and
bought
a
great
deal
of
lukens
and
push
the
stock
out
of
our
buying
range
i
have
the
impression
after
ben
told
me
the
story
that
he
didn
t
want
to
be
rude
and
hadn
t
realize
how
important
his
comment
be
he
try
to
keep
thing
simple
he
write
that
he
didn
t
believe
security
analyst
should
use
more
than
arithmetic
and
possibly
a
little
algebra
for
any
investment
decision
because
ben
be
a
culture
many
faceted
man
he
didn
t
spend
as
much
time
on
investment
as
do
others
in
the
field
he
like
to
try
new
idea
in
the
late
s
he
become
involve
in
promote
his
ever
normal
granary
theory
and
write
a
book
on
it
call
storage
and
stability
in
which
some
commodity
and
metal
would
be
use
as
a
backing
for
our
currency
his
idea
make
sense
and
with
cotton
at
six
cent
a
pound
and
other
raw
material
at
low
price
it
be
an
interest
proposal
he
never
have
the
clout
to
sell
it
to
the
congress
although
bernard
baruch

friend

it

the

look
at
the

then
he

three
buck
i
paid
and
still
concerned
that

for

as
the
partnership
close
out
buffett
still
a
young
man
with
a
maverick
offbeat
manner
be
planning
big
thing
here
s
a
last
look
back
at
two
partnership
letter
warren
e
buffett
underwood
ave
omaha
nebraska
second
annual
letter
to
limited
partner
the
general
stock
market
picture
in
in
last
year
s
letter
to
partner
i
say
the
follow
my
view
of
the
general
market
level
be
that
it
be
price
above
intrinsic
value
this
view
relates
to
blue
chip
security
this
view
if
accurate
carry
with
it
the
possibility
of
a
substantial
decline
in
all
stock
price
both
undervalue
and
otherwise
in
any
event
i
think
the
probability
be
very
slight
that
current
market
level
will
be
thought
of
as
cheap
five
year
from
now
even
a
full
scale
bear
market
however
should
not
hurt
the
market
value
of
our
work
out
substantially
if
the
general
market
be
to
return
to
an
undervalue
status
our
capital
might
be
employ
exclusively
in
general
issue
and
perhaps
some
borrow
money
would
be
use
in
this
operation
at
that
time
conversely
if
the
market
should
go
considerably
high
our
policy
will
be
to
reduce
our
general
issue
as
profit
present
themselves
and
increase
the
work
out
portfolio
all
of
the
above
be
not
intend
to
imply
that
market
analysis
be
foremost
in
my
mind
primary
attention
be
give
at
all
time
to
the
detection
of
substantially
undervalue
security
the
past
year
witness
a
moderate
decline
in
stock
price
i
stress
the
word
moderate
since
casual
reading
of
the
press
or
converse
with
those
who
have
have
only
recent
experience
with
stock
would
tend
to
create
an
impression
of
a
much
great
decline
actually
it
appear
to
me
that
the
decline
in
stock
price
have
be
considerably
less
than
the
decline
in
corporate
earn
power
under
present
business
condition
this
mean
that
the
public
be
still
very
bullish
on
blue
chip
stock
and
the
general
economic
picture
i
make
no
attempt
to
forecast
either
business
or
the
stock
market
the
above
be
simply
intend
to
dispel
any
notion
that
stock
have
suffer
any
drastic
decline
or
that
the
general
market
be
at
a
low
level
i
still
consider
the
general
market
to
be
price
on
the
high
side
base
on
long
term
investment
value
our
activity
in
the
market
decline
have
create
great
opportunity
among
undervalue
situation
so
that
generally
our
portfolio
be
heavier
in
undervalue
situation
relative
to
work
out
than
it
be
last
year
perhaps
an
explanation
of
the
term
work
out
be
in
order
a
work
out
be
an
investment
which
be
dependent
on
a
specific
corporate
action
for
its
profit
rather
than
a
general
advance
in
the
price
of
the
stock
as
in
the
case
of
undervalue
situation
work
out
come
about
through
sale
merger
liquidation
tender
etc
in
each
case
the
risk
be
that
something
will
upset
the
applecart
and
cause
the
abandonment
of
the
plan
action
not
that
the
economic
picture
will
deteriorate
and
stock
decline
generally
at
the
end
of
we
have
a
ratio
of
about
between
general
issue
and
work
out
now
it
be
about
during
the
past
year
we
have
take
position
in
two
situation
which
have
reach
a
size
where
we
may
expect
to
take
some
part
in
corporate
decision
one
of
these
position
account
for
between
and
of
the
portfolio
of
the
various
partnership
and
the
other
account
for
about
both
of
these
will
probably
take
in
the
neighborhood
of
three
to
five
year
of
work
but
they
presently
appear
to
have
potential
for
a
high
average
annual
rate
of
return
with
a
minimum
of
risk
while
not
in
the
classification
of
work
out
they
have
very
little
dependence
on
the
general
action
of
the
stock
market
should
the
general
market
have
a
substantial
rise
of
course
i
would
expect
this
section
of
our
portfolio
to
lag
behind
the
action
of
the
market
result
for
in
the
three
partnership
which
we
form
in
do
substantially
well
than
the
general
market
at
the
begin
of
the
year
the
dow
jones
industrials
stood
at
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
it
be
at
for
a
loss
of
point
if
one
have
own
the
average
he
would
have
receive
point
in
dividend
reduce
the
overall
loss
to
point
or
for
the
year
this
loss
be
roughly
equivalent
to
what
would
have
be
achieve
by
invest
in
most
investment
fund
and
to
my
knowledge
no
investment
fund
invest
in
stock
show
a
gain
for
the
year
all
three
of
the
partnership
show
a
gain
during
the
year
amount
to
about
and
on
year
end
net
worth
naturally
a
question
be
create
as
to
the
vastly
superior
performance
of
the
last
partnership
particularly
in
the
mind
of
the
partner
of
the
first
two
this
performance
emphasizes
the
importance
of
luck
in
the
short
run
particularly
in
regard
to
when
fund
be
receive
the
third
partnership
be
start
the
late
in
when
the
market
be
at
a
low
level
and
when
several
security
be
particularly
attractive
because
of
the
availability
of
fund
large
position
be
take
in
these
issue
whereas
the
two
partnership
form
earlier
be
already
substantially
invest
so
that
they
could
only
take
relatively
small
position
in
these
issue
basically
all
partnership
be
invest
in
the
same
security
and
in
approximately
the
same
percentage
however
particularly
during
the
initial
stage
money
becomes
available
at
vary
time
and
vary
level
of
the
market
so
there
be
more
variation
in
result
than
be
likely
to
be
the
case
in
later
year
over
the
year
i
will
be
quite
satisfied
with
a
performance
that
be
per
year
well
than
the
average
so
in
respect
to
these
three
partnership
be
a
successful
and
probably
well
than
average
year
two
partnership
be
start
during
the
middle
of
and
their
result
for
the
balance
of
the
year
be
roughly
the
same
as
the
performance
of
the
average
which
be
down
about
for
the
period
since
inception
of
the
partnership
their
portfolio
be
now
start
to
approximate
those
of
the
partnership
and
performance
of
the
entire
group
should
be
much
more
comparable
in
the
future
interpretation
of
result
to
some
extent
our
well
than
average
performance
in
be
due
to
the
fact
that
it
be
a
generally
poor
year
for
most
stock
our
performance
relatively
be
likely
to
be
well
in
a
bear
market
than
in
a
bull
market
so
that
deduction
make
from
the
above
result
should
be
temper
by
the
fact
that
it
be
the
type
of
year
when
we
should
have
do
relatively
well
in
a
year
when
the
general
market
have
a
substantial
advance
i
would
be
well
satisfied
to
match
the
advance
of
the
average
i
can
definitely
say
that
our
portfolio
represent
well
value
at
the
end
of
than
it
do
at
the
end
of
this
be
due
to
both
generally
low
price
and
the
fact
that
we
have
have
more
time
to
acquire
the
more
substantially
undervalue
security
which
can
only
be
acquire
with
patience
earlier
i
mention
our
large
position
which
comprise
to
of
the
asset
of
the
various
partnership
in
time
i
plan
to
have
this
represent
of
the
asset
of
all
partnership
but
this
cannot
be
hurry
obviously
during
any
acquisition
period
our
primary
interest
be
to
have
the
stock
do
nothing
or
decline
rather
than
advance
therefore
at
any
give
time
a
fair
proportion
of
our
portfolio
may
be
in
the
sterile
stage
this
policy
while
require
patience
should
maximize
long
term
profit
i
have
try
to
cover
point
which
i
felt
might
be
of
interest
and
disclose
as
much
of
our
philosophy
as
may
be
impart
without
talk
of
individual
issue
if
there
be
any
question
concern
any
phase
of
the

letter
follow
the
general
stock
market
in
a
year
ago
i
comment
on
the
somewhat
faulty
picture
present
in
by
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
which
have
advanced
from
to
or
although
practically
all
investment
company
show
gain
for
that
year
less
than
of
them
be
able
to
match
or
well
the
record
of
the
industrial
average
the
dow
jones
utility
average
have
a
small
decline
and
the
railroad
average
record
a
substantial
one
in
the
picture
be
reverse
the
industrial
average
decline
from
to
or
add
back
the
dividend
which
would
have
be
receive
through
ownership
of
the
average
still
left
it
with
an
overall
loss
of
on
the
other
hand
the
utility
average
show
a
good
gain
and
while
all
the
result
be
not
now
available
my
guess
be
that
about
of
all
investment
company
out
perform
the
industrial
average
the
majority
of
investment
company
appear
to
have
end
the
year
with
overall
result
in
the
range
of
plus
or
minus
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
common
stock
register
loss
for
the
year
while
show
gain
result
in
my
continual
objective
in
manage
partnership
fund
be
to
achieve
a
long
term
performance
record
superior
to
that
of
the
industrial
average
i
believe
this
average
over
a
period
of
year
will
more
or
less
parallel
the
result
of
lead
investment
company
unless
we
do
achieve
this
superior
performance
there
be
no
reason
for
existence
of
the
partnership
however
i
have
point
out
that
any
superior
record
which
we
might
accomplish
should
not
be
expect
to
be
evidence
by
a
relatively
constant
advantage
in
performance
compare
to
the
average
rather
it
be
likely
that
if
such
an
advantage
be
achieve
it
will
be
through
well
than
average
performance
in
stable
or
decline
market
and
average
or
perhaps
even
poorer
than
average
performance
in
rise
market
i
would
consider
a
year
in
which
we
decline
and
the
average
to
be
much
superior
to
a
year
when
both
we
and
the
average
advanced
over
a
period
of
time
there
be
go
to
be
good
and
bad
year
there
be
nothing
to
be
gain
by
get
enthuse
or
depressed
about
the
sequence
in
which
they
occur
the
important
thing
be
to
be
beating
par
a
four
on
a
par
three
hole
be
not
as
good
as
a
five
on
a
par
five
hole
and
it
be
unrealistic
to
assume
we
be
not
go
to
have
our
share
of
both
par
three
s
and
par
five
s
the
above
dose
of
philosophy
be
be
dispense
since
we
have
a
number
of
new
partner
this
year
and
i
want
to
make
sure
they
understand
my
objective
my
measure
of
attainment
of
these
objective
and
some
of
my
know
limitation
with
this
background
it
be
not
unexpected
that
be
a
well
than
average
year
for
us
as
contrast
with
an
overall
loss
of
for
the

we
have
a
gain
for
the

for
the

it
should

emphasize
again
that
these

the

the
net
result
to
the
limited

would
depend
on
the

that
they
have

upon
what
would
have
be
realize
upon

and
what
would

and
be
different

from

when

the
cumulative

although
four

be
entirely
too
short
a
period
from
which
to
make
deduction
what
evidence
there
be

toward
confirm
the
proposition
that
our
result
should
be
relatively
well
in
moderately
decline
or
static
market
to
the
extent
that
this
be
true
it
indicates
that
our
portfolio
may
be
more
conservatively
although
decidedly
less
conventionally
invest
than
if
we
own
blue
chip
security
during
a
strongly
rise
market
for
the
latter
we
might
have
real
difficulty
in
match
their

of

a

that
the

there
have

no
partnership
which
have
have
a
consistently
superior
or
inferior
record
compare
to
our
group
average
but
there
have
be
some
variance
each
year
despite
my
effort
to
keep
all

invest
in
the

and
in
about
the

proportion
this
variation
of

could
be

by

the

such
a
move
would
also
eliminate
much
detail
and
a
moderate
amount
of
expense
frankly
i
be
hopeful
of
do
something
along
this
line
in
the
next
few
year
the
problem
be
that
various

preference
for

unanimous

several

inquire
about

the

it

in

five
year
the
business
operate
in
a
more
or
less
monopolistic
manner
with
profit
realize
in
every
year
accompany
by
almost
complete
immunity
to
recession
and
lack
of
need
for
any
sale
effort
in
the
earlier
year
of
the
business
the
insurance
industry
become
fearful
that
sanborn
s
profit
would
become
too
great
and
place
a
number
of
prominent
insurance
men
on
sanborn
s
board
of
director
to
act
in
a
watch
dog
capacity
in
the
early
s
a
competitive
method
of
underwriting
know
as
card
make
inroad
on
sanborn
s
business
and
after
tax
profit
of
the
map
business
fell
from
an
average
annual
level
of
over
in
the
late
s
to
under
in
and
consider
the
upward
bias
in
the
economy
during
this
period
this
amount
to
an
almost
complete
elimination
of
what
have
be
sizable
stable
earn
power
however
during
the
early
s
sanborn
have
begin
to
accumulate
an
investment
portfolio
there
be
no
capital
requirement
to
the
business
so
that
any
retain
earnings
could
be
devote
to
this
project
over
a
period
of
time
about
million
be
invest
roughly
half
in
bond
and
half
in
stock
thus
in
the
last
decade
particularly
the
investment
portfolio
blossom
while
the
operating
map
business
wilt
let
me
give
you
some
idea
of
the
extreme
divergence
of
these
two
factor
in
when
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
be
in
the
range
sanborn
sell
at
per
share
in
with
the
average
in
the
area
sanborn
sell
at
per
share
yet
during
that
same
period
the
value
of
the
sanborn
investment
portfolio
increase
from
about
per
share
to
per
share
this
mean
in
effect
that
the
buyer
of
sanborn
stock
in
be
place
a
positive
valuation
of
per
share
on
the
map
business
less
the
value
of
the
investment
unrelated
to
the
map
business
in
a
year
of
depressed
business
and
stock
market
condition
in
the
tremendously
more
vigorous
climate
of
the
same
map
business
be
evaluate
at
a
minus
with
the
buyer
of
the
stock
unwilling
to
pay
more
than
on
the
dollar
for
the
investment
portfolio
with
the
map
business
thrown
in
for
nothing
how
could
this
come
about
sanborn
in
as
well
as
possess
a
wealth
of
information
of
substantial
value
to
the
insurance
industry
to
reproduce
the
detailed
information
they
have
gather
over
the
year
would
have
cost
ten
of
million
of
dollar
despite
card
over
million
of
fire
premium
be
underwritten
by
mapping
company
however
the
mean
of
sell
and
packaging
sanborn
s
product
information
have
remain
unchanged
throughout
the
year
and
finally
this
inertia
be
reflect
in
the
earnings
the
very
fact
that
the
investment
portfolio
have
do
so
well
serve
to
minimize
in
the
eye
of
most

need
for

satisfied
with
the

very
successful
turn
around

considerable
expertise
in

after
some
discussion
regard
his
need
for
an
operating
manager
for
a
farm
machining
company
he
own
in

we
very
quickly
come
to
a
mutual
employment
agreement
and
i
depart

day
later
my

i
might
add
be
in
her
high
school
senior
year
the
culture
change
be
not
easily
acceptable
to
her
now
you
must
realize
dempster
mill
be
a
fine
old
company
with
an
excellent
potential
or
i
m
sure
warren
wouldn
t
have
be
interested
this
have
a
stimulate
effect
on
all
of
us
especially
me
for
i
knew
if
we
exert
the
effort
we
could
turn
it
around
and
make
it
produce
up
to
warren
s
measure
of
performance
and
that
s
pretty
high
i
hasten
to
say
there
be
others
involve
in
this
venture
warren
and
charlie
of
course
bill
scott
and
verne
mckenzie
who
at
the
time
be
our
outside
auditor
they
all
come
up
with
idea
and
make
my
task
easy
one
idea
come
from
warren
and
charlie
upon
investigate
our
sale
pricing
structure
we
be
value
replacement
and
repair
part
equal
to
the
total
of
the
sum
of
the
complete
item
so
lack
any
cost
data
to
determine
correct
pricing
they
suggest
we
simply
categorize
all
part
into
three
category
an
item
proprietary
not
available
except
from
us
increase
up
to
an
item
semi
proprietary
increase
to
non
proprietary
increase
to
we
turn
this
inventory
with
an
estimate
inventory
value
of
thousand
into
a
resale
value
exceed
million
incidentally
we
have
few
if
any
objection
to
our
pricing
strategy
and
continued
to
sell
these
part
at
high
sale
price
with
little
if
any
sale
resistance
this
of
course
lead
us
into
other
pricing
update
and
to
support
continued
upward
sale
price
adjustment
a
cost
data
system
be
instal
and
maintain
our
initial
effort
at
reorganization
be
impede
somewhat
for
not
only
do
we
have
two
different
union
to
contend
with
we
have
a
cadre
of
employee
use
to
work
at
an
unacceptable
pace
little
accountability
for
quality
and
little
if
any
leadership
initiative
so
as
we
begin
the
process
of
reorganization
include
of
course
among
other
thing
a
substantial
reduction
in
employee
which
didn
t
exactly
endear
us
to
the
union
or
some
of
the
local
business
people
all
in
all
i
consider
our
effort
in
turn
dempster
into
a
well
run
reputable
business
be
very
beneficial
to
the
local

an
ail
business
make
it

at
the

and
do
business
with
our
office
in

so
we
start
talk
and
he
ask
me
for
a
few
quote
he
ask
me
what
the
price
of

i
m
short
the
stock
i
be
just
a
rookie
at
that
point
but
i
look
at
this
young
whippersnapper
and
say
you
can
t
buy
stock
you
re
too
young
and
he
say
i
have
it
in
my
sister
s
name
that
put
me
in
my
place
right
away
our
friendship
grow
and
when
he
eventually
go
to
columbia
university
we
correspond
then
when
he
get
back
home
he
be
work
for
his
father
who
operate
an
over
the
counter
house
in
omaha
warren
be
sell
stock
of
his
choice
to

he
realize
that
he
be
make
to
in
commission
and
the
customer
be
make
several
thousand
dollar
so
he
say
i
d
like
to
participate
in
that
i
think
that
s
where
the
idea
for
the
partnership
come
from
olson
i
be
buying
stock
on
my
own
but
i
didn
t
really
have
any
money
i
be
in
my
early
thirty
and
i
realize
that
i
need
training
and
help
if
i
be
go
to
invest
in
the
stock
market
and
that
s
how
i
met
warren
buffett
he
be
teach
a
night
course
at
what
at
the
time
be
the
university
of
omaha
but
what
be
now
call
the
university
of
nebraska
at
omaha
he
have
a
night
course
go
and
i
take
it
in
fact
i
take
it
twice
because
i
be
so
impressed
with
his
teach
he
be
only
twenty
seven
year
old
at
that
time
but
he
be
so
clear
on
how
he
evaluate
stock
use
the
graham
technique
he
be
a
value
investor
and
he
evaluate
not
only
the
stock
but
the
background
of
it
i
remember
he
be
interested
in
a
company
that
be
base
in
kansa
city
and
rather
than
just
sit
around
and
read
report
he
go
out
to
kansa
city
to
see
what
the
company
be
do
that
impressed
me
very
much
holland
around
i
convince
my
wife
who
have
a
little
money
to
put
some
with
warren
i
think
about
that
a
lot
because
if
i
d
fail
at
that
and
give
her
bad
advice
i
would
ve
be
in
trouble
then
a
little
later
i
go
through
the
trouble
of
borrowing
on
my
life
insurance
to
put
some
of
my
own
money
with
warren
over
the
year
we
gradually
put
in
more
because
he
just
kept
do
well
and
well
it
be
a
real
goin
gussie
and
then
warren
and
i
become
personal
friend
we
played
bridge
together
we
played
golf
together
we
played
tennis
and
table
tennis
god
we
played
everything
my
wife
get
warren
interested
in
buying
his
house
in
southern
california
and
susan
buffett
become
one
of
my
wife
s
well
friend
we
be
very
close
to
them
during
that
time
and
have
be
good
friend
ever
since
so
we
never
sell
it
even
after
he
fold
the
partnership
we
held
onto
berkshire
until
begin
sometime
in
the
ninety
it
s
just
be
phenomenal
one
time
not
too
long
ago
i
say
to
warren
you
know
i
want
to
thank
you
for
all
you
ve
do
for
me
and
warren
say
hell
dick
i
didn
t
do
anything
for
you
you
never
sell
i
think
i
get
along
with
warren
because
we
have
a
similar
outlook
we
lead
very
simple
life
we
don
t
have
mansion
or
fancy
car
or
all
the
paraphernalia
we
ve
live
in
the
same
house
now
for
forty
seven
year
warren
s
live
in
the
same
house
for
thirty
or
forty
year
now
there
s
a
certain
similarity
to
buffett
investor
they
be
like
that
you
don
t
see
a
buffett
investor
be
very
conspicuous
in
the
early
day
i
go
to
all
the
partnership
meeting
and
i
ve
get
to
say
look
at
those
guy
you
d
never
guess
that
these
be
some
of
the
richest
people
around
there
be
two
old
lady
friend
of
value
investor

school
up
in
vermont
there
be
some
family
here
in
omaha
who
be
early
investor
but
if
you
hung
around
these
people
you
never
have
any
idea
that
they
be
worth
a
pile
of
money
the
impression
i
ve
have
be
that
this
be
the
kind
of
person
who
be
attract
to

i
ve
be

california
for
a
few
week

would
have

back
to
you
sooner
i

have
to
keep
you

in

the

great

though
i
couldn
t
corner
the

maybe
i
can
pull
off
this
coup
with
the
plate
block
your
letter
contains
some
unusually
perceptive
insight
and
it
be
useful
to
me
when
i
be
young
i
thought
that
if
i
ever
make
a
lot
of
money
i
would
compile
the
world
s
great
stamp
collection
and
spend
a
lot
of
time
on
the
project

similar
ambition
to
buy
a
professional
sport
team
and
to
build
my
own
golf
course
my
passion
have
evolve

he
do
get
to
meet
with

in
response
to

s
reply
letter
also
include
halperin
recall
the
meeting
with
buffett
in
his
kiewit
plaza
office
he
met
me
at
the
door
to
his
office
himself
show
me
around
for
a
couple
of
minute
then
we
sat
on
the
couch
while
he
ask
me
question
and
disperse
story
and
advice
there
be
no
one
else
in
the
room
during
the
entire
two
hour
meeting
which
flew
by
from
my
perspective
though
probably
not
from
his
he
take
just
two
phone
call
last
less
than
one
minute
each
he
spent
an
unbelievably
generous
two
hour
of
uninterrupted
time
with
me
ostensibly
i
be
there
to
explain
heritage
auction
gallery
business
model
to
him
but
really
i
need
his
advice
since
we
be
consider
sell
of
our
business
to
a
private
equity
firm
which
in
retrospect
would
have
be
a
huge
mistake
in
under
three
minute
mr
buffett
verbalize
what
i
have
subconsciously
know
for
the
previous
few
month
i
e
exactly
why
despite
their
assurance
to
the
contrary
it
be
unreasonable
to
believe
that
our
prospective
partner
be
as
interested
in
our
long
term
horizon
as
we
be
the
next
day
i
be
able
to
persuade
my
partner
not
to
do
the
deal
unfortunately
heritage
be
and
still
be
too
small
to
meet
buffett
s
ever
rise
acquisition
criterion
but
i
think
we
be
gain
on
it
and
every
important
decision
we
make
be
now
filter
through
the
question
will
this
solution
make
heritage
a
more
worthy
candidate
to
someday
be
acquire
by
a
company
like
berkshire
hathaway
if
imitation
suggests
admiration
far
proof
of

of
most
thing
there

nothing
material
i
want
very
much
he

his
personality
be
ablaze
make
johnny
carson
in
his
day
seem
catatonic
various
people
have
described
buffett
s
offbeat
brilliant
mentality
in
different
way
have
an
almost
photographic
memory

once
told
her
that
warren
s
analytical
power
be
such
that
he
can
see
in
the
dark
some
downside
must
exist
ask
people
to
cite
criticism
of
buffett
and
you
ll
get
these
type
of
reply
he
need
help
turn
on
the
radio
he
can
barely
start
a
car
he
wouldn
t
know
if
a
new
piece
of
furniture
or
a
rug
be
put
in
his
home
once
when
he
be
out
of
town
mr
buffett
redecorate
the
house
the
story
go
that
when
he
come
home
buffett
didn
t
notice
any
change
i
don
t
think
he
understands
how
to
use
the
fax
machine
i
can
t
put
a
call
on
hold
buffett
admits
i
have
a
little
trouble
turn
on
a
light
switch
but
that
s
ok
since
he
can
see
in
the
dark
maybe
superman
wear
warren
buffett
pajama
be
there
any
folk
who
don
t
care
for
buffett
a
few
mostly
out
of
envy
there
must
be
some
people
out
there
who
don
t
like
the
guy
right
well
sure
a
long
list
actually
buffett
have
lobby
hard
for
expense
stock
option
so
the
silicon
valley
crowd
aren
t
big
fan
some
also
point
out
that
for
all
of
buffett
s
grouse
about
corporate
governance
berkshire
have
a
paucity
of
outside
director
buffett
give
money
to
plan
parenthood
so
he
s
not
a
favorite
of
the
right
to
lifer
many
investment
banker
don
t
like
him
they
can
t
snow
him
and
he
s
no
friend
to
the
wall
street
analyst
he
won
t
give
them
any
guidance
and
as
someone
the
only
one
who
routinely
and
consistently
beat
the
market
he
must
drive
disciple
of
the
efficient
market
theory
crazy
former
sec
chairman
harvey
pitt
may
be
a
bit
peeve
at
him
since
buffett
be
less
than
supportive
of
his
tenure
and
then
there
s
the
matter
of
the
vote
cast
earlier
this
year
against
buffett
for
director
of
berkshire
for
the
record
he
receive
vote
in
his
favor
fortune
november
buffett
can
give
the
appearance
of
be

the
absent

professor
tousle

rumple

and
a
high

yes
the
world

most
profitable
investor
look
like
an
absent

professor
but
as
soon
as
he
speaks
that
impression
be
dispel
the
word
almost
explode
from
him
with
a
pulse
energy
the
mirror
may
people
snap
to
attention
in
awe
because
of
the
crystal
clarity
penetration
and
facile
summary
he
can
bring
to
a
complex
problem
he
be
a
master

whose
verbal
and
write
skill
be
unique
what
he
say
be
informative

believe
for
a
moment
that
they
be
equal
with
him
in
his
reason

buffett
my
grade
school
classmate
of
many
year

have
say
that
if
you

a
company
whose
competitive
advantage
constitute
a
virtual
moat
around
it
you
ve
found
an
excellent
business
well
vulcan
s
principal
business
isn
t
protect
by
a
moat
but
it
do
enjoy
some
important
competitive
advantage
it
s
be
almost
year
since
i
join
vulcan
over
that
period
vulcan
s
average
annual
shareholder
return
have
be
the
comparable
s
p
return
be
buffett
s
style
be
tackle
problem
his
intellectual
brilliance
can
solve
and
steer
clear
of
problem
it
cannot
often
he
have
say
he
s
try
to
step
over
one
foot
obstacle
not
jump
over
seven
foot
obstacle
he
strives
to
make
thing
as
easy
as
possible
by
seek
sensible
efficient
path
make
the
layup
as
he
put
it
because
half
court
shot
be
not
high
percentage
shot
he
work
hard
at
the
possible
and
avoids
the
unlikely
or
impossible
one
of
his
great
message
be
to
avoid
trouble
in
the
stock
market
that
mean
stay
away
from
capital
loss
follow
ben
franklin
s
advice
buffett
be
generally
early

well
than
most
people

hour
of

a
day
and
his
sleep
experience
be
about
the
same
as
everyone
else
s
he
watch
television
about
seven
hour
a
week
keep
abreast
mainly
of
news
and
sport
he
be
a
statistic
nut
and
his
recall
of
baseball
batting
average
and
trivia
be
nearly
encyclopedic
in
a
new

write
that
buffett
have
no

flatly
declare
to
davis
for
well
or
bad
a
lot
of
berkshire

once
john
hillery
a
canadian
investment
advisor

to
buffett
ask
for
a
breakdown
of
berkshire

which
bond
be
convertible

buffett
reply
in
a
letter
date
december
we
may
be
able
to
put
something
in
the
report
such
as
you
suggest
relate
to
bond
type
and
maturity
we
get
very
little
in
the
way
of
formal
report
and
most
of
that
sort
of
information
be
in
my
head
rather
than
in
any
computer
printout
but
i
may
try
to
give
some
general
impression
if
i
have
a
section
on
bond
investment
again
this
year
basically
a
homebody
buffett
prefers
to
stick
close
to
his
own
home
and
office
as
well
as
to
his
own
counsel
yet
he
do
have
to
travel
as
he
serf
on
a
number
of
corporate
board
and
occasionally
he
manages
to
get
away
to
his
second
home
in
laguna
beach
california
people
who
have
work
with
buffett
for
year
say
they
have
never
see
him
lose
his
temper
if
he
find
a
typo
he
might
say
let
s
change
those
letter
around
or
maybe
i
give
you
the
wrong
word
accountant
can
give
him
sheet
of
number
only
to
be
shock
when
he
quickly
may
say
there
s
a
problem
with
that
number
there
be
rarely
any
pomposity
or
moodiness
in
this
multibillionaire
he
responds
to
situation
with
rationality
not
anger
his
reply
to
thing
that
be
agreeable
with
him
be
usually
yeah
sure
if
something
displeases
him
his
reply
can
be
we
don
t
need
any
of
that
when
he
say
i
follow
that
a
little
you
re
in
for
quite
an
information
avalanche
ever
the
gentleman
he
never
yell
or
scream
his
hand
off
respectful
manner
with
manager
involves
only
the
slightest
hint
of
consider
a
new
direction
a
rebuke
could
come
in
a
gentle
form
i
might
have
do
it
differently
manager
sometimes
call
him
for
a
push
when
a
deal
be
at
the
point
but
he
rarely
step
in
even
when
invite
his
response
to
the
world
after
give
it
a
thorough
examination
be
positive
and
witty
he
often
delivers
self
deprecate
humor
as
in
your
chairman
have
blunder
again
or
he
may
offer
story
about
how
he
study
the
soft
drink
industry
for
more
than
year
and
eventually
determine
that
the
industry
s
two
main
rival
coca
cola
and
pepsi
have
both
do
well
upbeat
those
who
have
work
with
buffett
describe
him
as
almost
unfailingly
upbeat
and
supportive
hardly
ever
testy
debbie
bosanek

assistant

yes
i

him
but
i

mad
i
don
t
think
he

to
though
if
you
make
a
mistake
and
be
honest
about
it
that
s
okay
but
you
wouldn

to
cover
it
up

buffett
can

long
passage
buffett
say
he
admires
russell
because
he
thought
like
graham
this
be
russell
s
prologue
to
the
autobiography
of
bertrand
russell
write
in
three
passion
simple
but
overwhelmingly
strong
have
govern
my
life
the
longing
for
love
the
search
for
knowledge
and
unbearable
pity
for
the
suffer
of
mankind
these
passion
like
great
wind
have
blown
me
hither
and
thither
in
a
wayward
course
over
a
deep
ocean
of
anguish
reach
to
the
very
verge
of
despair
i
have
sought
love
first
because
it
brings
ecstasy
ecstasy
so
great
that
i
would
often
have
sacrifice
all
the
rest
of
life
for
a
few
hour
of
this
joy
i
have
sought
it
next
because
it
relief
loneliness
that
terrible
loneliness
in
which
one
shiver
consciousness
look
over
the
rim
of
the
world
into
the
cold
unfathomable
lifeless
abyss
i
have
sought
it
finally
because
in
the
union
of
love
i
have
see
in
a
mystic
miniature
the
prefigure
vision
of
the
heaven
that
saint
and
poet
have
imagine
this
be
what
i
sought
and
though
it
might
seem
too
good
for
human
life
this
be
what
at
last
i
have
found
with
equal
passion
i
have
sought
knowledge
i
have
wish
to
understand
the
heart
of
men
i
have
wish
to
know
why
the
star
shine
and
i
have
try
to
apprehend
the
pythagorean
power
by
which
number
hold
sway
above
the
flux
a
little
of
this
but
not
much
i
have
achieve
love
and
knowledge
so
far
as
they
be
possible
lead
upward
toward
the
heaven
but
always
pity
brought
me
back
to
earth
echo
of
cry
of
pain
reverberate
in
my
heart
child
in
famine
victim
torture
by
oppressor
helpless
old
people
a
hat
burden
to
their
son
and
the
whole
world
of
loneliness
poverty
and
pain
make
a
mockery
of
what
human
life
should
be
i
long
to
alleviate
the
evil
but
i
cannot
and
i
too
suffer
this
have
be
my
life
i
have
found
it
worth
living
and
would
gladly
live
it
again
if
the
chance
be
offer
me

buffett
also
admires
the
writing
of
british
economist
and
investor
john
maynard
keynes
such
as
essay
in
persuasion
keynes
be
know
for
invest
only
in
a
very
few
company
in
which
he
have
full
confidence
buffett
particularly
like
biography
he
have
read
such
book
as
father
son
and
company
mcdonald
s
behind
the
arch
the
big
story
influence
bonfire
of
the
vanity
liar
s
poker
den
of
thief
and
barbarian
at
the
gate
he
s
read
all
the
usual
book
but
they
be
usually
financially
related
say
his
daughter
susan
require
reading
for
investor
buffett
say
include
the
chapter
about
margin
of
safety
and
about
investor
attitude
towards
the
market
in
the
intelligent
investor
the
edition
of

analysis
the
money
master
and
investor
phil
fisher
s
first
two
book
buffett
write
forbes
october
about
his
appreciation
for
fisher
s
and
graham
s
influence
particularly
fisher
s
at
this
time
how
lucky
i
have
be
to
have
phil
fisher
and
ben
graham
write
down
their
idea
when
they
have
no
financial
incentive
to
do
so
i
be
league
ahead
richer
than
i
would
be
if
i
hadn
t
read
phil
i
can
t
even
calculate
the
compound
rate
of
return
from
the
few
dollar
spent
buying
his
book
year
ago
fisher
be
quote
by
forbes
october
on
the
day
of
the
stock
market
crash
there
be
two
fundamental
approach
to
investment
there
s
the
approach
ben
graham
pioneer
which
be
to
find
something
intrinsically
so
cheap
that
there
be
little
chance
of
it
have
a
big
decline
he
s
get
financial
safeguard
to
that
it
isn
t
go
to
go
down
much
and
sooner
or
later
value
will
come
into
it
then
there
be
my
approach
which
be
to
find
something
so
good
if
you
don
t
pay
too
much
for
it
that
it
will
have
very
very
large
growth
the
advantage
be
that
a
big
percentage
of
my
stock
be
apt
to
perform
in
a
small
period
of
time
although
it
have
take
several
year
for
some
of
these
to
even
start
and
you
re
bound
to
make
some
mistake
at
it
but
when
a
stock
be
really
unusual
it
make
the
bulk
of
its
move
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time
the
disadvantage
of
ben
graham
s
approach
as
he
preach
it
be
it
be
such
a
good
method
that
practically
everybody
know
it
and
have
picked
up
the
thing
that
meet
his
formula
i
don
t
want
to
say
that
mine
be
the
only
formula
for
success
but
i
think
and
i
may
be
conceited
about
this
that
i
start
my
business
before
the
term
growth
stock
be
thought
of
from
his
house
buffett
can
nose
down
farnam
street
to
his
spartan
office
in
less
than
five
minute
another
several
minute
away
be
downtown
omaha
should
he
need
to
go
that
far
one
of
his
mantra
be
that
it
s
much
easy
to
stay
out
of
trouble
now
than
to
get
out
of
trouble
later
along
with
his
motto
of
keep
thing
simple
he
want
to
keep
distraction
to
a
minimum
and
to
be
consistent
if
you
can
live
close
to
the
office
do
it
if
a
nearby
restaurant
serf
a
hamburger
or
steak
you
like
why
search
out
a
restaurant
across
town
the
stage
deli
in
new
york
have
a
sandwich
in
buffett
s
honor
it
s
one
of
his
favorite
roast
beef
on
white
with
extra
mayo
it
s
list
on
the
menu
as
the
oracle
of
omaha
omaha
world
herald
may
wall
streeter
marshall
weinberg
a
stockbroker
with
gruntal
co

go
to
the
old
reuben
s
deli
in
new

for
a
meal
with
buffett
he
have
an
exceptional
ham
and
cheese
sandwich
a
few
day
later
we
be
go
out
again
he
say
let
s
go
back
to
that
restaurant
i
say
but
we
be
just
there
precisely
why
take
a
risk
with
another
place
we
know
exactly
what
we
re
go
to
get
weinberg
continued
by
that
logic
we
d
go
there
every
day
to
which
buffett
reply
precisely
why
not
eat
there
every
day
another
of
buffett
s
tenet
don
t
run
all
around
without
a
good
reason
you
can
do
most
of
what
you
need
to
do
right
where
you
be
i
ll
be
in
omaha
as
long
as
i
live
buffett
have
told
berkshire
shareholder
another
lesson
buffett
have
learn
be
do
thing
himself
he
drove
himself
to
the
berkshire
annual
meeting
in
parking
his
car
around
back
of
the
joslyn
art
museum
with
its
collection
of
work
date
to
antiquity
just
before
he
get
back
to
his
car
after
the
meeting
a
berkshire
shareholder
come
up
to
him
with
a
thick
pile
of
paper
and
ask
him
if
he
would
look
at
them
he
say
he
would
and
she
ask
if
she
should
mail
them
to
him
oh
no
i
ll
just
take
them
and
read
them
back
at
the
office
he
take
the
paper
get
in
his
dark
blue
cadillac
and
no
doubt
drove
back
to
the
office
and
read
them
it
be
not
until
that
buffett
actually
bought
himself
a
lincoln
town
car
in
reference
to
that
particular
purchase
omaha
stockbroker
george

a
little
mellower

down
a

you

and
that
she

joy
from

cloud
she
say
people
can
be
with
him
but
they
be

day
that
they

the
slave
of
the
world
she
described
him
as
a
bit
fearful
to
trust
people
cerebral
not

and
with
a
mind
on

susie
figure
out
it
be

he
never

pompous
he
just
simply
operates
in

because
you
re
in
physical
proximity
with

reading
she

really
doesn
t
care
about
the
money
except
as

it

i

there
be
nothing
you
could
tell
him
that
he
didn
t
already
know
but
i
always
get
the
impression
he
would
support
me
in
whatever
i
chose
peter
have
say
his
father
call
and
visit
frequently
and
enjoys
hearing
about
the

talk
to
him
about
what

unusual
peter
told
the
lincoln
nebraska
journal
august
it
be
incredibly
normal
almost
to
a
fault
he
warren
buffett
really
didn
t
reach
notoriety
until
the
s
when
i
be
a
kid
i
never
thought
twice
about
who
he
be
and
what
he
be
do
we
didn
t
live
in
what

neighborhood
we
didn
t
go
to
a
special
school
we
didn
t

out
of
the
ordinary
peter

told
worth
magazine
april
for

get
paid
for
something
like

well
i
get
this

and
he

be
like
wow
that
s
a
lot
of
money
accord
to
his
sister
susan
peter

would
rather
spend
an
even
on
a

in

than
have
a
date
with
angelina
jolie
which
be
not
true
of
all
member
of
the
family
but
that
s
true
of
howie
say
warren
buffett
bloomberg
october
the
time
quote
warren
buffett
as
say
that
although
his
son
would
not
run
the
company
he
would
provide
crucial
oversight
i
want
berkshire
and
the
culture
to
continue
and
he
would
be
there
to
ensure
that
happens
and
he
have
my
idea
about
who
i
think
should
be
run
it
buffett
at
a
press
conference
the
day
after
the
annual
meeting
say
if
he
be
to
die
say
at
it
would
be
up
to
the
board
but
his
hope
be
that
the
board
would
name
howard
as
a
non
executive
non
paid
chairman
as
a
double
protection
of
the
culture
he
say
he
really
want
howard
to
be
there
simply
to
guard
against
a
wrong
decision
be
make
in
berkshire
s
annual
report
buffett
write
i
believe
it
would
be
wise
when
i
be
no
longer
ceo
to
have
a
member
of
the
buffett
family
serve
as
the
non
paid
non
executive
chairman
of
the
board
that
decision
however
will
be
the
responsibility
of
the
then
board
of
director

buffett

about

sometimes

i
do
take
his
advice

have
some
coca

howard

of
his

with
a
laugh
he
learn
it
all
from
me
howard
didn
t
regard
his
father
as
unusual
i
never
thought
of
him
as
any
different
just
as
my
dad
just
as
anyone
else
would
howard
buffett
do
however
admit
that
there
be
a
few
puzzle
thing
go
on
even
in
his
youth
i
remember
him
up
in
his
office
at
the
house
reading
moody
s
or
something
he
work
really
hard
he
could
work
hour
a
day
say
howard
i
do
remember
once
when
we
be
on
vacation
in
california
and
he
be
constantly
on
the
phone
with
stan
lipsey
of
the
buffalo
news
for
about
three
day
straight
there
be
a
strike
at
the
paper
and
my
father
be
go
through
every
business
calculation
he
say
his
father
be
near
the
conclusion
that
it
be
go
to
be
more
economical
to
close
the
paper
than
to
keep
publishing
howard
recall
it
never
come
to
that
but
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
controversy
underestimated
how
seriously
his
father
be
think
of
closing
it
because
reason
dictate
such
i
ve
watch
him
go
through
the
process
say
howard
he
take
all
the
emotion
out
of
a
decision
he
just
go
through
the
fundamental
reason
when
he
make
a
decision
he
doesn
t
deviate
buffett
be
a
compassionate
person
but
when
it
come
to
business
decision
he
boil
it
all
down
to
hard
fact
and
reason
my
father
couldn
t
run
a
lawnmower
i
never
saw
him
cut
the
grass
trim

hedge
or
wash
a
car
howard

in
fact
it
be
overwhelm
say
howard
like
his
brother
peter
he
found
it
be
almost
impossible
to
tell
his
father
anything
he
didn
t
already
know
or
to
achieve
success
that
ever
compare
with
that
of
his
father
howard
told
fortune
magazine
september
how
he
farm
acre
and
love
the
work
i
ve
be
farm
nine
year
it
s
a
very
independent
type
of
activity
everything
s
up
to
you
it
teach
you
a
value
system
and
give
you
the
instrument
to
achieve
that
now
he
farm
acre
in
central
illinois
and
his
son
howard
warren
buffett
farm
a
acre
family
farm
in
nebraska
maybe
howard
hasn
t
heard
the
adage
there
be
three
easy
way
of
lose
money
race
be
the
quick
woman
the
most
pleasant
and
farm
the
most
certain
regard
the
acre
farm
howard
say
long
ago
when
he
ran
it
dad
own
the
land
i
pay
him
a
percentage
of
the
gross
income
as
rent
the
rent
be
base
upon
my
weight
i
m
foot
and
i
weigh
around
pound
he
think
i
weigh
too
much
that
i
should
weigh
if
i
m
over
my
rent
be
of
gross
income
if
i
m
under
it
s
the
buffett
family
version
of
go
to
weight
watcher
i
don
t
mind
it
really
he
s
show
he
s
concerned
about
my
health
even
at
he
s
get
a
big
payback
than
almost
anybody
around
howard
say
later
that
although
his
father
be
receive
the
high
end
of
a
normal
return
on
farm
ground
rental
that
s
ok
after
all
say
the
young
buffett
i
feel
very
fortunate
that
my
dad
have
enough
interest
in
my
farm
activity
that
he
be
willing
to
purchase
a
farm
it
s
my
dream
but
it
s
his
farm
and
it
s
his
privilege
to
determine
how
he
want
to
rent
it
to
me
as
thing
turn
out
when
howard
move
to
decatur
illinois
he
sub
lease
the
land
at
a
good
profit
above
what
he
pay
his
father
he
do
miss
the
tractor
and
the
plow
however
one
winter
after
he
move
to
decatur
howard
s
neighbor
found
their
driveway
have
be
clear
on
some
snowy
day
one
neighbor
discover
howard
snow
plow
one
day
and
ask
him
why
he
be
do
it
howard
say
he
miss
be
on
his
tractor
so
much
that
he
get
one
out
and
be
happy
to
play
snow
remover
before
howard
s
move
to
illinois
he
have
lunch
with
his
father
every
tuesday
we
have
a
great
relationship
he
have
be
a
great
instructor
a
great

i
never
look
at
my
dad
as
the
warren
buffett
that
you
see
in
forbes
magazine
all
i
see
him
as
be
my
dad
but
at
the
same
time
i
realize
he

experience

knowledge
to
offer
he
told
the
omaha

herald
october
accord
to
his
son
what
be
it
that
make
warren
buffett
tick
i
think
it
stem
from
his
basic
philosophy
that
you
ought
to
want
to
give
back
to
society
and
not
just
be
a
consumer
of
it
that
s
totally
consistent
with
what
he
do
say
howard

do
want
to
be
a
success
and
he
like
to

creative
he
s
extra
creative
and
intelligent
he
have
all
the
tool
and
all
that
s
combine
with
a
drive
and
determination
there
s
an
inside

banana

since
i
be
a

i
ask
jimmy
if
he

to
warren
say
monroe
he
say
he
thought
he
be

sure
of
the
exact
genealogy
although
jimmy
buffett
continue
to
make
million
in

i
think
the
real
test
of
the
business
gene
would
be
whether
jimmy
have
be
smart
enough
to

that
jimmy

have
long
be

shareholder
fortune
june
conclude
warren
and
jimmy
probably
be
thought
to
be
related

cannot
prove
beyond
a
doubt
possibly
from

family
in
an

not

no
money
in
my

and
nothing
particular
to

me
on

i
thought
i
would
sail
about
a
little
and
see
the

bring
up
the

it
require
a
strong

prevent
me
from
deliberately
step
into
the
street
and
methodically
knock
people
s
hat
off
then
i
account
it
high
time
to
get
to
sea
as
soon
as

all

as
yogi
berra
have

nickel
isn

today
buffett
would
explain
at
the
berkshire
annual

that
the

be
a
commodity
business

lining
in

war
ii
it
all
come
to
mean
nothing
when
a
foreign
business
could
make
the
lining
more
cheaply
so
berkshire
be
not
a
howl
success
now
he
know
to
go
with
the
low
cost
producer
i
knew
it
be
a
tough
business
i
be
either
more
arrogant
or
innocent
then
he
say
we
learn
a
lot
of
lesson
but
i
wish
we
could
have
learn
them
somewhere
else

production
end
in

continued
to

until
buffett
later
say
we
go
into
a
terrible
business
because
it
be
cheap
fortune
july
although
buffett
paid
less
than
work
capital
for
berkshire
he
later
say
that
the
work
capital
turn
out
to
be
a
mirage
and
that
berkshire
be
not
only
a
cigar
butt

a
soggy
cigar
butt
at
that
at

s
annual

buffett
discuss
the
negative
impact
of
this
soggy

berkshire
itself
be
a

believe
it
or
not
we
go
into
berkshire

it
be
cheap

buffett
say

the
dumbest
stock
he
ever
bought
it
be
a

he
told

buying

be
spark
in

want

try

buffett

put

elsewhere
say
in
an

company
instead
of
a
decline
textile
berkshire
may
have
be
worth
twice
as
much
today
as
it
be
buffett
recall
his
plan
of
want
to
buy
the
stock
and
tender
it
for
a
profit
in
we
have
quite
a
bit
of
stock
and
i
go
back
to
management
seabury
stanton
be
the
ceo
and
he
look
at
me
and
say
mr
buffett
we
ve
get
some
excess
money
we
re
go
to
have
a
tender
offer
at
what
price
will
you
tender
your
stock
and
i
say
when
the
tender
offer
come
out
officially
at
and
th
it
make
buffett
mad
so
i
go
out
and
start
buying
the
stock
and
i
bought
control
of
the
company
and
fire
mr
stanton
now
that
sound
like
a
great
little
morality
tale
but
the
truth
be
i
have
now
commit
a
major
amount
of
money
to
a
terrible
business
in
when
a
good
insurance
company
come
along
i
bought
it
for
berkshire
hathaway
i
really
should
have
bought
it
for
a
new
entity
so
as
of
buffett
consider
his
berkshire
purchase
to
be
his
great
mistake
but
acknowledge
the
possibility
bad
could
happen
yet
if
you
come

the

with

at
the
bottom
apparently
that
conclusion

reach
because

of

what

buffett

with

it
will

more

of

u
s
ain
t
gonna
happen
at
the
annual
meeting
buffett
put
it
this
way
if
berkshire
could
grow
at
of
its
book
value
annually
it
could
gobble
up
the
gdp
we
think
about
it
occasionally
but
it
won
t
happen
buffett
doesn
t
care
to
own
some
part
of
the
world
but
he
clearly
have
set
out
to
own
some
of
the
best
part
and
he
may
see
berkshire
have
some
role
in
the
world
however
many
investor
simply
do
not
believe
the
stock
can
go
high
in
my
early
day
as
a
stockbroker
i
try
to
sell
a
share
of
berkshire
to
a
potential
buyer
after
much
back
and
forth
i
receive
this
note
from
him
when
i
get
some
mad
money
i
d
like
to
buy
a
share
or
two
it
s
hard
to
justify
for
a
share
that
pay
no
dividend
how
high
can
it
go
we
will
do
some
business
together
i
never
heard
from
him
again
berkshire
do
not
have
a

you
count

as
an
intern
i
be
ask

my

told
me
that
berkshire
be
a
horrible
company
with
an
inflate
value
due
to
warren
buffett
he
far
add
he
didn
t
trust
mr
buffett
and
related
him
to
al
dunlap
so
he
decide
to
position
himself

his
client
in
a

go

i
won

because
he
wasn

come
in
no

just
don

the
stock
most
brokerage
firm
don
t
follow
the
stock
have
no
opinion
about
it
and
thus
its
broker
can
t
solicit
order
for
berkshire
unless
they
convince
their
firm
they
have
research
it

try
to
convince
someone
to
buy
a
stock
trading
in

isn

worth
the
trouble
for

stock
exchange
because
of
its
high

a
few

make
a

a
quirk
in
brokerage
commission
schedule
which
usually
doesn

go
above
a

and
involves
the
combination
of
the
price
and
number
of

creates
only
a
tiny
commission
on

at
some
discount
brokerage
one
can
buy

out
that
any

who
recommend

hold
berkshire

stock
from
to
now
would
have
make
his

fabulously
wealthy
a
single
share
of
berkshire
hathaway
purchase
for
in
would
be
worth
as
of
april
but
any
broker
who
do
so
would
have
starve
to
death
while
work
in
the
early
s
for
his
father
s
brokerage
firm
in
omaha
nebraska
buffett
say
he
learn
that
the
broker
be
not
your
friend
he
s
more
like
a
doctor
who
charge
patient
on
how
often
they
change

and
he
get
paid

tim
callahan
a
stockbroker
in
birmingham
alabama
say
berkshire
be
mutual
fund
like
and
because
of
its
low
commission
structure
it
s
basically
no
load
no
fee
in
fact
berkshire
be
really
a
no
load
fund
with
low
expense
once
investor
be
in
berkshire
most
don
t
sell
therefore
a
broker
be
less
likely
to
enjoy
a
round
trip
on
commission
berkshire
stock
just
do
not
fit
into
the
scheme
of
thing
for
stockbroker
i
begin
buying
berkshire
in
the
early
s
i
bought
from
until
say
chad
brenner
a
lawyer
in
cleveland
ohio
who
say
buffett
s
insistence
on
quality
management
and
long
term
outlook
appeal
to
him
i
m
not
a
smart
seller
i
ve
never
sell
any
share
my
kid
will
inherit
my
stock
and
i
m
buffett
say
in
that
more
than
of
berkshire
share
be
held
by
the
same
people
who
be
shareholder
five
year
before
that
and
that
of
the
share
be
held
by
investor
for
whom
the
next
large
investment
be
less
than
half
the
size
of
their
berkshire
holding
thus
berkshire
have
a
loyal
group
of
shareholder
with
a
big
percentage
of
their
net
worth
rid
on
berkshire
s
fortune
the
float
be
so
thin
and
share
be
trade
so
infrequently
that
one
can
stand
with
jim
maguire
at
his
post
on
the
floor
of
the
new

stock
exchange
where
berkshire
and
more
than
other
company
trade
and
find
an
hour
or
two
may
pas
between
berkshire
trade
year
ago
that
interval
might
have
be
an
entire
day
buffett
once
recall
that
on
the
day
berkshire
be
list
on
the
new

in
he
told
maguire
i
will
consider
you
an
enormous
success
if
the
next
trade
in
this
stock
be
about
two

usually
be
floor
by
the
price
and
then
put
off
again
because
it
pay
no
dividend
the
price
be
high
of
course
because
the
underlie
value
be
high
but
another
reason
be
because
buffett
have
never
split
the
class
a
stock
reason
that
such
action
be
cosmetic
involve
paperwork
and
attract
the
kind
of
investor
interested
in
meaningless
stock
split
rather
than
those
concerned
about
what
the
company
be
really
worth
buffett
want
investor
not
speculator
although
it
s
fun
when
dividend
arrive
dividend
be
after
tax
money
from
the
corporation
which
be
taxed
again
when
an
individual
pay
tax
dividend
may
look
good
and
they
definitely
feel
good
but
buffett
s
not
about
look
or
feel
good
it
make
more
sense
and
that
be
what
buffett
be
about
not
to
have
dividend
particularly
if
buffett
be
your
money
manager
and
be
reinvesting
wisely
with
berkshire
the
investor
be
leave
his
share
of
the
retain
earnings
within
the
company
for
buffett
to
reinvest
which
he
have
compound
at
an
average
of
a
year
would
anyone
prefer

a
or
so
paid

dividend
that

have
sent

buffett
view
the

like
the
american

charge
card
and
traveler
s
check
business
and
he
conclude
their
strength
be
unassailable
and
powerful
enough
to
carry
the
company
through
troubled
time
buffett
already
understood
the
principle
of
benefiting
from
other
people
s
money
he
knew
american
express
be
a
good
business
because
of
the
huge
cash
float
generate
by
american
express
traveler
s
check
buffett
knew
the
float
like
a
low
cost
loan
be
valuable
so
he
go
about
make
sure
the
underlie
business
be
not
hurt
by
the
cloud
overhang
american

steakhouse
in
omaha
one
of
his
favorite
haunt
as
well
as
in
other
establishment
buffett
stood
behind
the
cashier
and
peeked
into
the
cash
register
to
see
if
people
be
still
use
american

and
check
he
found
that
merchant
be
still
accept
the

berkshire
own
about
in
because
the

be
honor
and
the
american

empire
remain
intact
buffett
bought
the
batter

in
so
convince
of
the
merit
of
the
investment
buffett
get
partner
to
agree
to
change
the

rule
so
that
he
could

reportedly
sell
out
with

apparently
his

bob
noyce
one
of
the
two
primary
founder
of

grow
up
in

iowa
i
think
he
be
the
son
of
a
minister
in
grinnell
go
to
grinnell
college
and
be

of

at

when
i
go
on
their
board
back
in
the
late
s
and
when
noyce
left
fairchild
to
form
intel
with
gordon
moore
grinnell
bought
of
the
private
placement
that
be
actually
the
initial
funding
for

inside

so
we
do
buy
of
the
original
issue
for

but
the
genius
who
ran
grinnell

there
s
no

for
anybody
who
calculates
the

today
buffett

much

we

in

to
berkshire
shareholder
buffett
revise
the
loss
estimate
and
accepted
personal
responsibility
for
pricing
error
we
initially
report
an
estimate
of
billion
for
our
pre
tax
insurance
loss
from
the
terrorist
attack
of
september
th
we
label
that
amount
a
guess
and
the
earnings
report
above
include
a
charge
of
billion
from
the
attack
this
revise
number
remains
a
guess
important
question
of
liability
will
likely
remain
unresolved
for
year
consequently
neither
we
nor
other
industry
participant
can
be
reasonably
precise
now
as
to
final
loss
we
estimate
that
about
billion
of
our
loss
occur
at
general
re
and
billion
at
berkshire
hathaway

an

of

during
the
first
nine
month
of
due
to
the
terrorist
attack
a
mega
catastrophe
be
no
surprise
one
will
occur
from
time
to
time
and
this
will
not
be
our
last
we
do
not
however
price
for
manmade
mega
cat
and
we
be
foolish
in
not
do
so
in
effect
we
and
the
rest
of
the
industry
include
coverage
for
terrorist
act
in
policy
cover
other
risk
and
receive
no
additional
premium
for
do
so
that
be
a
huge
mistake
and
one
that
i
myself
allow
i
m
in
the
insurance
business
an
expensive
place
to
be
in
the
past
couple

it

make

the

i
do
something
very

for
a
huge
catastrophe
loss
without
its
get
a

do
so
the
risk
we
unthinkingly
assume
be
a
loss
from
terrorism
in
an

in

similar

only

in
my
opinion
we
would
arrive
at
a
solution
for
this
societal
problem
if
we
be
to

neither
they

heider
recall
warren

as
a
very
intelligent

sure
all
the

be
out
before

for

i
also
believe
warren
be
well
ahead
of
his
time
in
recognize
the
value
of

i
e
in

at

style
ringwalt
s
memoir
tale
of
national
indemnity
company
and
its
founder
jack
d
ringwalt
say
at
the
time
buffett
be
about
year
old
when
the
two
first
met
buffett
be
try
to
raise
to
start
an
investment
pool
ringwalt
say
he
offer
to
invest
buffett
however
say
he
would
accept
nothing
less
than
i
remark
if
you
think
i
be
go
to
let
a
punk
kid
like
you
handle
of
my
money
you
be
even
nuttier
than
i
thought
ringwalt
write
ringwalt
take
back
his
offer
of
the
if
i
have
put
in
at
the
time
he
so
desire
i
could
have
take
out
million
after
tax
year
later
i
do
pretty
well
with
national
indemnity
co
but
not
that
well
p
as
to
his
sale
of
national
indemnity
ringwalt
write
when
i
first
have
a
call
from
a
local
investment
house
as
to
the
purchase
of
part
of
my
stock
in
order
to
make
a
public
market
i
be
not
particularly
interested
but
i
do
think
that
if
i
could
sell
part
of
the
stock
i
would
be
a
little
more
comfortable
financially
and
it
would
make
the
settlement
of
my
estate
easy
if
some
kind
of
a
market
value
exist
the
gentleman
finally
make
an
offer
which
be
approximately
of
the
liquidate
value
and
we
have
some
fairly
sharp
word
over
what
i
felt
to
be
a
ridiculously
low
offer
i
accordingly
have
nothing
far
to
do
with
this
firm
for
several
year
at
that
time
i
have
a
call
from
their
mr
charles
heider
and
i
have
a
great
admiration
for
that
gentleman
for
the
way
he
soothe
my
hurt
feeling
he
persuade
his
firm
to
offer
a
fair
price
for
a
substantial
block
of
stock
and
there
be
some
kind
of
public
market
a
little
later
i
have
a
phone
call
from
mr
warren
buffett
as
to
whether
i
would
be
kind
enough
to
send
him
the
same
information
i
sent
stockholder
i
be
at
that
time
conceited
enough
to
think
that
mr
buffett
be
interested
enough
in
know
what
security
i
be
buying
not
to
the
extent
of
follow
my
lead
but
perhaps
to
the
extent
of
make
an
independent
check
on
a
security
about
which
he
might
not
otherwise
have
thought
i
realize
later
that
he
be
study
my
operation
and
continued
to
study
it
for
several
year
before
i
have
any
far
contact
with
him
in
january
of
he
call
and
ask
me
to
have
dinner
with
him
i
told
him
that
i
be
go
to
florida
the
next
day
and
would
see
him
when
i
get
back
he
persuade
me
to
drop
in
on
the
way
home
state
that
it
would
not
take
over
or
minute
to
discus
what
he
have
in
mind
when
i
get
there
the
follow
conversation
take
place
wb
how
do
it
happen
you
never
sell
your
company
jr
because
only
crook
and
bankrupt
people
have
want
it
wb
what
other
reason
jr
i
would
not
want
the
other
stockholder
to
take
less
per
share
than
i
would
receive
myself
wb
what
else
jr
i
wouldn
t
want
to
double
cross
my
agent
wb
what
else
jr
i
don
t
want
my
employee
to
worry
about
lose
their
job
wb
what
else
jr
i
be
sort
of
proud
of
this
as
an
omaha
institution
and
i
would
want
it
to
remain
in
omaha
wb
what
else
jr
i
don
t
know
isn
t
that
enough
wb
what
be
your
stock
worth
jr
accord
to
the
world
herald
the
market
value
be
per

but
the
stock
be
worth
per
share
wb
i
will
take
it
i
be
somewhat
dumbfound
as
i
do
not
have
the
slightest
idea
that
he
be
interested
in
purchasing
my
stock
nor
be
i
at
all
sure
that
i
want
to
sell
it
i
thought
however
that
mr
buffett
at
least
have
an
honest
reputation
and
be
financially
responsible
and
that
it
might
not
be
such
a
bad
idea
i
felt
in
addition
that
he
would
probably
change
his
mind
while
i
be
in
florida
anyhow
but
when
i
come
back
his
attorney
have
prepared
document
and
he
have
deposit
fund
with
the
u
s
national
bank
to
take
care
of
all
stock
tender
i
really
do
not
believe
that
our
conversation
take
over
minute
and
no
price
be
mention
by
either
of
us
except
the
i
of
course
wonder
what
would
have
happen
if
i
would
have
mention
or
but
i
be
sure
that
mr
buffett
will
never
tell
me
i
really
do
not
anticipate
stay
with
the
company
for
more
than
day
or
so
but
i
found
mr
buffett
to
be
a
very
considerate
chairman
of
the
board
and
i
do
remain
with
the
company
for
more
than
six
year
at
which
time
i
be

can
you

too
buffett
have
say
insurance
be
an
industry
that
doesn

bring
particularly
good
return
because
many
poor

of

attract
to
a

which
essentially
give
someone

occasionally
buffett
have
misjudge
the
business
know
for
its

cycle
and
be
the
first
to

overall
his

berkshire

doesn

buffett
once

that
when

we

berkshire
could

more
business
than
it
do
the
ability
to
turn
bad
news
into
good
news
exists
because
berkshire
s
untapped
capacity
be
huge
meaning
berkshire
can
absorb

whereas
wobbly

can

if
they

you
can

they
look
at

say
that

what
be
you
do

then
somebody
else
come

asks
why

you
maybe
the

above
all
he
add
if

the

buffett
say
it
have
be
a
big
mistake
by
some
analyst
to
think
of
the
value
of
the
insurance
operation
as
its
book
value
alone
without
regard
to
the
value
of
the
float
annual
meeting
that
s
the
well
from
which
berkshire
draw
its
wealth
say
one
shareholder
and
you
pay
no
tax
on
float
the
return
on
float
be
yours
float
be
a
liability
deduct
from
the
asset
of
berkshire
in
the
calculation
for
the
company
s
book
value
so
float
be
accrue
as
a
liability
and
account
for
in
berkshire
s
book
value
or
net
worth
berkshire
s
insurance
business
have
offer
up
the
holy
grail
by
essentially
provide
year
of
free
money
but
not
when
berkshire
paid
dearly
for
the
money
it
brought
in
as
it
do
in
due
to
terrorist
and
other
loss
and
again
in
when
hurricane
hit
the
gulf
coast
despite
its
triple
a
credit
rating
meaning
it
could
borrow
money
cheaply
it
wound
up
pay
the
same
rate
junk
bond
issuer
pay
for
money
in
berkshire
s
annual
report
buffett
write
about
float
say
unless
you
understand
this
subject
it
will
be
impossible
for
you
to
make
an
inform
judgment
about
berkshire
s
intrinsic
value
he
continued
since
when
we
enter
the
insurance
business
our
float
have
grown
at
an
annual
compound
rate
of
well
yet
it
have
cost
us
nothing
and
in
fact
have
make
us
money
therein
lie
an
accounting
irony
though
our
float
be
show
on
our
balance
sheet
as
a
liability
it
have
have
value
to
berkshire
great
than
an
equal
amount
of
net
worth
would
have
have
buffett
told
shareholder
at
the
berkshire
annual
meeting
float
come
to
us
at
a
negative
cost
with
a
cost
less
than
zero
it
come
with
a
profit
attach
he
add
but
the
real
key
be
what
the
float
will
be
in
year
we
have
billion
of
float
presently
buffett
say
at
berkshire
s
annual
meeting
and
if
i
be
offer
billion
for
that
float
and
do
not
have
to
pay
tax
on
the
gain
but
would
thereafter
have
to
stay
out
of
the
insurance
business
forever
a
perpetual
non
compete
in
any
kind
of
insurance
would
i
accept
that
the
answer
be
no
that
s
not
because
i
d
rather
have
billion
of
float
than
billion
of
free
money
it
s
because
i
expect
the
billion
to
grow
berkshire
have
more
than
billion
in
float
as
a
result
of
its
acquisition
of
general
re
by
mid
berkshire
have
billion
of
float
or
about
of
the
domestic
property
casualty
float
when
that
float
hit
berkshire
s
doorstep
it
s
immediately
invest
in
stock
bond
and
business
buffett
have
call
the
float
largely
tantamount
to
equity
the
growth
of
float
can
be
roughly
regard
as
income
no
carry
charge
and
possibly
no
repayment
exist
buffett
write
in
berkshire
s
annual
report
that
float
have
have
more
economic
value
to
us
than
an
equal
amount
of
net
worth
would
have
have
as
long
as
we
can
continue
to
achieve
an
underwriting
profit
float
will
continue
to
outrank
net
worth
in
value
some
berkshire
observer
have
conclude
that
float
have
economic
value
equal
to
equity
when
the
combine
underwriting
ratio
be
the
float
have
more
economic
value
than
equity
when
the
combine
ratio
be
less

and
have
less
economic
value
than
equity
when
the
float
be
obtain
at
a
combine
ratio
of
more
than
although
in
many
year
berkshire
have
have
no
cost
for
its
float
the
cost
of
float
mushroom
in
to
mainly
because
of
large
loss
at
general
re
but
be
only
in
in
with
float
at
billion
and
pre
tax
underwriting

of
billion
the
cost
of
the
float
be
a
negative
float
be
at
billion
at
the
end
of
still
at
a
negative
cost
buffett
say
in
the
annual
report
to
summarize
last
year
we
be
paid
billion
to
hold
an
average
of
about
billion
in
berkshire
wound
up
with
billion
in

at
a

of
slightly
less

zero
in

of
more
than
billion
in
hurricane

float
in
late

munger

wesco
s
annual
meeting
in
grow
float
at
a
good
clip
at
a
low
cost
be
very
difficult
it
s
almost
impossible
but
we
intend
to
do
it
anyway
it
s
the
dirt
cheap
cost
of

writes

most
likely

clearly
it
s
good
to
have
the
policyholder
s
money
for
as
long
as
possible
but
buffett
have
warn
that
long

be
tricky
because
when
the

that
his

that

buy

i

well
last

we
make

so
if
my
multiplication
be
right
that
s
million
and
i
gulped
and
he
say
ok
and
i
say
million
he
say
you
re
too
late
at
a
berkshire
annual

buffett
be
ask
about
the
problem
at
lloyd

his
response
shine
light
on
the
solidity
of
berkshire
for
a
century
syndicate
of
lloyd
s
have
operate
in
such
a
way
that
its
member
have
unlimited
liability
they
be
a
center
for
certain
type
of
insurance
and
a
very
important
center
the
liability
that
have
accrue
to
certain
member
because
of
thing
like
asbestos
where
they
have
no
idea
of
the
huge
scale
in
which
the
cost
would
occur
have
cause
a
number
of
the
people
who
be
willing
to
be
name
to
dramatically
decrease
and
lloyd
s
be
grope
around
for
some
system
that
handle
the
problem
of
the
long
tail
liability
and
unlimited
liability
i
don
t
think
that
they
ve
get
any
easy
answer
to
that
so
i
think
that
they
ll
still
be
grope
to
some
extent
a
year
or
two
hence
quite
clearly
all
of
that
be
a
benefit
to
us
i
ll
tell
you
what
really
benefit
us
the
hurricane
in
florida
look
like
it
will
ultimately
prove
to
have
cause
billion
or
so
of
damage
but
it
s
very
easy
to
visualize
a
hurricane
that
come
up
and
hit
long
island
that
could
triple
or
quadruple
that
amount
well
when
you
start
talk
about
or
billion
of
loss
and
very
major
company
in
this
business
only
have
a
couple
of
billion
dollar
of
net
worth
berkshire
have
a
significant
advantage
to
be
able
to
sustain
significant
loss
we
should
be
able
to
get
the
appropriate
premium
i
m
not
sure
what
lloyd
s
total
capital
be
but
i
don
t
think
that
they
have
as
much
capital
in
aggregate
as
we
do
and
most
of
theirs
be
psychological

ours

really
a

wake
up

if

long
be

that
part
of
the

remain
fairly
small
until
that

buffett
begin
to
expand
both
the

the
casualty

side
of
his

very
aggressively
berkshire

shot
from
just
million
in
to
million
in

now
represent
nearly
three
quarter

but
even
as

price
have
shot
up
in
recent
year
many

still
have
be
hit
the
report
continue
since

have
lose
cent
on
every

but
during
the

period
berkshire

paid
out
only
million

on
million

that
s
a
five

average
return
before

of
the
financial

story
go
on
to
say
but
buffett

real
genius
becomes
apparent
in
casualty
reinsurance
unlike
property
claim
casualty
claim
often
take
year
to
settle
so
here
buffett
play
a
complicate
game
that
employ
both
a
tax
shelter
and
the
float
on

before
they
re
paid
to
settle

berkshire
s
record
in
casualty

may
look
terrible
but
it
isn

over
the

it
have
incur

so

you
wonder
why
anyone
in
his
right
mind
would
be
write

like
this
but
don
t

the
float
unlike
u
s

u
s
casualty
reinsurers
get
the
use
of
the

for
five

more
year
compound
it
in
a
tax
free
reserve
set
up
in
anticipation
of

here
be
where

at
prodigious
rate
per

for
the

year
at
that
rate
million
in

becomes
million
in
five
year
time
more
than
enough
to
pay
even

way
overprice
compare
to
these
other
company
for
all
kind
of
reason
and
it
didn
t
make
any
sense
to
me
from
davidson
buffett
learn
the
important
concept
of
float
make

off
other
people

money
by
invest
insurance
premium
in

only

one
time

buffett
told
forbes
october
what
he
like
about

it
geico
be
a
company
sell

well
below
all
the
standard
company
and
make
profit
margin
it
have
an
underwriting
cost
then
of
or
so
whereas
the
standard

have
probably

huge
competitive
advantage

the
idea

be
met
with
little
interest

sell
his
first

pp
it
wasn
t
necessarily
bankrupt
but
it
be
head
there
it
be
it
have
a
great
business
franchise
which
have
not
be
destroyed
by
a

of
error
that
have
be
make
in

of
exploit
that
franchise
and
it
have
a
manager
i
felt
he
have
the
ability
to
get
through
an
extraordinarily
tough
period
there
and
to
re
establish
the
value
of
that
franchise
they
still
be
a
low
cost
operator
they
make
all
kind
of
mistake
they
still
didn
t
know
their
cost
because
they
didn
t
know
what
their
loss
reserve
should
be
and
they
get
captivate
by
growth
they
do
all
kind
of
thing
wrong
but
they
still
have
the
franchise
it
be
similar
to
american
express
in
late
when
the
salad
oil
scandal
hit
it
it
do
not
hurt
the
franchise
of
the

the
credit

it
could
have
ruin
the

of

the
answer
of

be
that
american
express
with
no
net
worth
be
worth
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
and
geico
with
no
net
worth
be
worth
a
tremendous
amount
of
money
too
except
it
might
get
close
up
the
next
day
because
it
have
no
net
worth
but
i
be
satisfied
that
the
net
worth
would
be
there
the
truth
be
a
lot
of
insurance
company
for
the
ownership
of
it
would
have
put
up
the
net
worth
we
would
have
put
it
up
but
they
be
try
to
save
it
for
the
shareholder
which
be
what
they
should
have

away
all
the

let
s
just
say
that
if

paid
out
a
million
dividend
right
now
which
would
eliminate
the
net
worth
of

would
it
still
have

you

you
d
have

that
kept

happy
but
the

value
be
the
big
value
in
something
like
that
a

the
importance
of
understand
where
a
company
stand
relative
to
its
competitor
with
geico
for
example
it
be
very
important
to
know
and
understand
that
competitor
such
as
traveler
aetna
state
farm
insurance
etc
would
not
adopt
geico

simple
no

no
commission
business
model
and
match
geico
s
low
price
for

these
competitor
have
too
much
to
lose
p
geico
be
a

cost
advantage
over

there

nothing
unique
about

of
what

should
consider
acquire
of

simpson
and
butler
say
they
be
concerned
about
the

first
because
berkshire
stock
do
not
pay
a
dividend
as
do
geico
second
because
they
thought
it

since
no
fractional

would
be
issue
the
geico
stockholder
would
wind
up
with
taxable
cash
the

then

to
the
possible
use
of

that
while
he
would

he

however

far
exceed
all
the

the

it

maybe
that
s
why
some
of

it

we
be

off

buffett
told
the
financial
time
october
i
ve
follow
equitas
ever
since
it
be
form
because
it
be
one
of
the
most
important
event
in
insurance
industry
history
maybe
five
year
ago
we
briefly
explore
the
idea
of
whether
a
transaction
of
this
sort
would
be
feasible
and
we
come
to
the
conclusion
it
be
not
feasible
at
that
time
there
be
just
too
many
unknown
and
not
enough
time
have
elapse
to
get
a
reasonable
fix
on
what
the
future
development
might
be
and
then
six
month
ago
after
the
march
report
equitas
annual
report
come
out
i
raise
the
question
with
ajit
jain
about
whether
there
have
be
enough
experience
that
we
could
propose
something
and
then
it
go
from
there
i
be
not
involve
with
the
discussion
they
primarily
involve
ajit
jain
on
our
side
and
then
we
have
a
number
of
other
people
work
on
it
one
internet
poster
saw
the
deal
s
upside
for
berkshire
this
way
assume
that
there
be
enough
money
in
equitas
today
to
handle
the
next
year
the
economics
of
the
deal
from
berkshire
hathaway
s
perspective
becomes
clear
national
indemnity
be
take
the
back
end
of
the
claim
stream
year
out
it
be
commit
to
pay
up
to
billion
for
that
back
end
portfolio
of
claim
in
exchange
for
make
that
commitment
it
be
get
million
today
in
surplus
a
number
i
derive
from
take
the
current
surplus
and
subtract
the
amount
that
equitas
will
retain
from
that
in
the
deal
plus
million
in
cash
from
the
corporation
of
lloyd
s
plus
another
million
from
equitas
while
it
get
that
money
over
a
couple
of
year
let
s
simplify
thing
and
say
that
berkshire
hathaway
be
receive
million
in
cash
today
approximately
million
for
its
billion
reinsurance
commitment
begin
in
if
national
indemnity
earns
a
return
of
percent
on
that
money
annually
over
this
period
national
indemnity
break
even
on
the
deal
in
other
word
in
exchange
for
the
cash
payment
of
million
national
indemnity
can
grow
that
money
to
the
billion
back
end
reinsurance
commitment
what
this
mean
of
course
be
that
national
indemnity
make
money
on
this
deal
if
any
of
the
follow
occur
a
it
get
more
than
percent
real
rate
of
return
if
the
return
be
it
will
make
nominally
billion
with
a
million
present
value
b
the
money
in
equitas
last
longer
than
year
allow
national
indemnity
to
far
grow
its
nest
egg
c
the
claim
stream
becomes
less
than
equitas
be
currently
project
in
part
here
s
how
buffett
described
the
equitas
deal
in
berkshire
s
annual
report
from
the
start
many
people
predict
equitas
would
eventually
fail
but
as
ajit
and
i
review
the
fact
in
the
spring
of
year
after
the
last
expose
policy
have
be
write
and
after
the
payment
of
billion
pound
in
claim
we
conclude
that
the
patient
be
likely
to
survive
and
we
decide
to
offer
a
huge
reinsurance
policy
to
equitas
because
plenty
of
imponderable
continue
to
exist
berkshire
could
not
provide
equitas
and
its
name
unlimited
protection
but
we
say
and
i
m
simplify
that
if
equitas
would
give
us
billion
in
cash
and
security
this
be
the
float
i
talk
about
we
would
pay
all
of
its
future
claim
and
expense
up
to
billion
that
amount
be
billion
above
what
equitas
have
recently
guess
its
ultimate
liability
to
be
thus
the
name
receive
a
huge
and
almost
certainly
sufficient
amount
of
future
protection
against
unpleasant
surprise
indeed
the
protection
be
so
large
that
equitas
plan
a
cash
payment
to
its
thousand
of
name
an
event
few
of
them
have
ever
dream
possible
and
how
will
berkshire
fare
that
depends
on
how
much
know
claim
will
end
up
cost
us
how
many
yet
to
be
present
claim
will
surface
and
what
will
be
the
cost
how
soon
claim
payment
will
be
make
and
how
much
we
earn
on
the
cash
we
receive
before
it
must
be
paid
out
ajit
and
i
think
the
odds
be
in
our
favor
and
should
we
be
wrong
berkshire
can
handle
it
the

of

be
grateful
for
what
he

withdraw
from

if
i

the
reason

th
of

also
suggest
that
the

with
a
value

warren
and
i
be
drive
down
to
glen
welby
for
the
weekend
one
day
in
when
as
tactfully
and
gently
as
he
could
he
broke
the
news
to
me
that
bill
ruane
and
sandy
gottesman
close
friend
of
his
and

who
have
bought

be
about
to
sell
all
or
half
of
their
post
stock
warren
have
ponder
how
best
to
deliver
this
news
and
he
try
sugar
coat
it
in
every
way
he
could
i
have
to
admit
that
my
immediate
response
be
to
burst
into
tear
here
be
these
terribly
clever
investor
repute
to
have
such
great
judgement
who
no
longer
believe
in
us
others
surely
would
be
leave
in
drove
i
consider
their
move
a
referendum
on
my
management
of
the
company
and
it
be
clear
i
be
found
want
warren
do
his
desperate
best
to
console
me
explain
that
bill
consider
he
have
do
so
well
on
post
stock
that
it
add
up
to
too
much
of
some
of
his
portfolio
he
be
keep
his
own
stock
you
don
t
know
wall
street
warren
try
to
reassure
me
people
don
t
think
in
a
long
term
way
there
when
your
stock
reach
wall
street
will
buy
it
naturally
i
thought
he
be
just
try
to
make
me
feel
well
it
be
absurd
to
think
that
the
stock
would
ever
reach
i
be
not
console
warren
of
course
have
a
totally
different
perspective
from
mine
on
what
bill
and
sandy
be
do
he
view
it
as
an
enormous
plus
in
the
lifetime
of
the
company
almost
like
the
time
herald
merger
though
he
knew
i
d
be
profoundly
distressed
by
the
idea
he
realize
right
away
how
much
the
company
would
benefit
in
future
profit
by
their
sell
their
stock
he
try
to
convince
me
that
we
should
be
hold
a
party
add
don
t
worry
we
ll
just
buy
what
they
sell
it
will
be
good
for
us
and
they
ll
regret
it
although
i
didn
t
stop
worry
we
do
buy
in
the
stock
at
an
average
price
of
which
sandy
and
bill
have
bought
before
two
split
at
an
equivalent
price
of
once
much
later
warren
and
i
discuss
woman
bursting
into
tear
in
business
situation
and
i
remind
him
of
our
ride

clearly
that
in

flatter
ourselves
that

and
his

off
the

say

if
i
try

remember
something
from
my

he
can
quote
it
back
it

over

the

have
strengthen
its
dominance
of

but
the
path
be
not
always
easy
coverage
of
the
watergate
scandal
particularly
by
bob
woodward
and
carl
bernstein
brought
the
paper
enormous
acclaim
include
a

prize
in
for
their
story
that
lead
to

the
anonymous
source
of
some
of
the
woodstein
story
become
synonymous
for
anything
smack
of
investigative
journalism
once
woodward
ask
buffett
for
advice
on
make
more
money
buffett
suggest
invest
woodward
told
buffett
i
don
t
know
anything
about
invest
yes
you
do
buffett
say
all
it
be
be
investigative
reporting
invest
be
journalism
buffett
told
woodward
invest
be
reporting
i
told
him
to
imagine
an
in
depth
article
about
his
own
paper
he
d
ask
a
lot
of
question
and
dig
up
a
lot
of
fact
he
d
know
the
washington
post
and
that
s
all
there
be
to
it
buffett
have
also
say
invest
be
journalism
buffett
flesh
out
that
story
during
a
talk
at
caltech
on
october
it
s
interest
that
you
mention
reporting
be
similar
to
invest
because
bob
woodward
i
think
back
in
or
when
i
first
get
interested
in
the
post
we
have
lunch
at
the
madison
and
he
be
say
what
he
might
do
with
his
money
and
i
say
bob
why
don
t
you
assign
yourself
a
story
get
up
an
hour
early
every
morning
and
work
on
a
story
you
ve
assign
yourself
now
a
sensible
story
to
assign
yourself
would
be
what
be
the
washington
post
company
worth
now
if
bradlee
give
you
that
story
to
work
on
what
would
you
do
for
the
next
week
or
two
you
would
go
around
and
talk
to
people
in
the
television
business
you
would
try
to
figure
out
what
be
the
key
variable
in
value
a
television
station
and
you
would
look
at
the
four
that
the
post
have
and
apply
those
standard
to
that
you
would
do
the

thing
to

the

p
we
be
all
there
at
the
post
on
the
night
of
november
it
be
a
dramatic
moment
with
rumor
of
printer
and
pressman
carry
gun
coincidentally
warren
buffett
and
his
wife
susie
be
right
across
the
street
from
the

stay
in
the
madison
hotel
have
come
to
town
for
their
close
up
look
at
the
washington
post
company
and
for
a
dinner
in
their
honor
at
my
house
the
next
night
they
be
look
out
their
window
all
night
at
the
commotion
the
light
and
the
television
camera
it
wasn
t
a
very
auspicious
begin
for
this
new
stockholder
to
observe
what
be
happen
at
the
washington
post
p
we
have
make
a
serious
mistake
in
let
the
pressman
back
into
the
pressroom
but
amazingly
they
have
print
a
paper
totally
prepared
by
nonunion
labor
and
cold
type
the
wildcat
strike
have
taught
both
the
union
and
management
quite
a
bit
nevertheless
when
the
printer
come
back
to
work
they
resume
slowdown
and
production
disruption
i
go
home
that
morning
at
about
six
tire
and
depressed
and
only
then
do
i
remember
that
i
have
forty
people
come
to
a
black
tie
dinner
that
night
at
my
house
for
the
buffetts
since
i
have
be
up
all
night
i
thought
of
cancel
but
it
seem
easy
to
go
ahead
with
it
warren
still
recall
his
introduction
to
washington
life
sit
between
barbara
bush
and
jane
muskie
we
have
schedule
a
lunch
at
the
post
the
next
day
so
that
warren
could
meet
with
various
people
on
both
the
business
and
editorial
side
of
the
paper
there
be
some
talk
of
acquisition
and
someone
mention
the
problem
of
amortization
of
goodwill
be
a
disadvantage
in
a
company
like
ours
because
of
its
accounting
impact
howard
simon
always
a
delightful
but
mischievous
goad
look
at
me
and
say
now
katharine
how
do
that
amortization
of
goodwill
work
the
conversation
stop
for
a
second
warren
recall
and
i
could
see
this
look
on
your
face
like
he
d
ask
you
to
explain
einstein
s
theory
of
relativity
with
several
corollary
here
be
my
chance
to
be
a
hero
so
i
jumped
in
and
explain
in
a
fairly
succinct
way
how
it
work
when
warren
finish
his
explanation
i
look
at
howard
and
say
exactly
p
buffett
kept
encourage
mr
graham
and
guide
her
business
education
warren
saw
how
little
i
knew
about
business
he
would
bring
about
or
annual
report
and
take
me
through
them
mr

say
during
these
tumultuous
event

stood
steadfast
and
in
the
end
his
investment
grow
mightily

then
so

although
he
retire
in
i
have
stayed
in
close
contact
with
him
on
a
wide
range
of
issue
as
have
other
member
of
our

former

douglas
daft
say
in
a
press
release
in
daft
say
he
would
retire
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
keough
return
to
the

to
make
way
for
the

old
keough
to
rejoin

have
to
change
its
rule
that
director
couldn
t
be
elect
after
they
reach
the
age
change
also
insured
that
buffett
at
the
time
could
remain
on
the

instead
of
advise
coke
from
the
sideline
keough
be
back
in
the
heart
of
the
company
for
which
he
have
have
a
lifelong
love
clearly
keough
doesn
t
think
much
of
the
idea
of
retirement
my
idea
of
hell
would
be
to
go
down
to
some
water
hole
buy
two
pair
of
pink
pant
and
wait
for
the

hour
atlanta
journal
constitution
february
maybe
one
reason
work
be
preferable
to
retirement
for
keough
be
because
he
consider
and
treat
his

if
there

on

it
s
coca

it
s
little
wonder
that
in

buffett
say
he
regard
coca
cola
as
the
most
valuable

when

buffett
give
a
number
of
reason
for
buying
and
others
supply
their
own
reason
but
in
the
end
it
may
be
more
than
just
a
list
of
reason
it
s
like
when
you
marry
a

buffett
say

put
some
worth
of

material
with
a
minimum
of
labor
through
plant
worth
about
and
it
will
try
to
show
why
the
coca

with
such
apparently
trifle
facility
be

at

in
that
coca
cola
s
repurchase
of
its

even
at

be
a
good
use
of
the

it
sound
like

very
high

when
you
name

those

here
to
save
those
of
us
who
actually
have
a
share
in
the
coca
cola
company
you
see
i
doesn
t
that
mean
they
claim
to
be
independent
it
mean
to
me
that
they
have
nothing
to
lose
i
do
i
m
a
shareholder
and
a
director
of
coke
mr
buffett
be
also
a
little
bit
of
an
owner
his
company
own
about
of
coke
he
put
up
his
money
and
take
a
chance
something
that
i
hasn
t
do
in
addition
to
put
his
money
where
his
mouth
be
mr
buffett
have
always
stood
for
shareholder
right
he
have
never
before
be
accuse
of
a
conflict
of
interest
now
there
s
always
a
first
maybe
i
have
a
strong
point
that
mr
buffett
s
vote
on
the
board
can
be
swayed
because
a
company
that
he
have
probably
forgot
that
he
own
have
a
small
contract
with
coke
that
could
add
up
to
as
much
as
three
cent
of
his
billion
fortune
maybe
i
should
come
to
the
annual
meeting
and
tell
him
that
to
his
face
maybe
they
should
buy
some
stock
so
that
they
would
have
that
privilege
maybe
they
should
explain
to
the
rest
of
the
owner
that
mr
buffett
s
departure
from
the
board
against
his
will
would
cause
a
decline
in
the
stock
if
it
drop
five
to
point
i
would
be
responsible
for
a
loss
to
the
owner
of
more
than
billion
maybe
they
should
underwrite
that
potential
loss
or
maybe
they
should
thank
warren
for
the
selfless
service
and
brilliant
guidance
that
he
s
provide
to
a
succession
of
management
over
year
they
could
do
that
and
then
pick
up
their
match
and
stake
and
still
have
time
for
another
fire
after
all

so
excsue
the

in
respond
i
be
also
reasonably
fast
at
type

poor
in
the
accuracy
department

fine
it
easy
just
to

i
be
afraid
you
have
the
husker
husky
situation
correctly
handicapped
we
need
a
miracle
and
it
s
unlikely

frost

not

why

why
i

could
not
be
more
on

in

the
company
have
a
royalty
on
a
communication
stream
that
can
do
nothing
but
grow
it
s
as
if
you
be
get
paid
for
every
gallon
of
water
start
in
a
small

but
with
add
amount
receive
as
tributary
turn
the

into

the
toughest
question
be
how
hard
to
push

i
write
a

he
collect
by
the
minute
and
distance

even
importance

the
call
if
he
could

on
swallow
probably
billion
a

if
these
average
gulp
be
one

i
feel
sure
perhaps
mistakenly
that
i
know
the
odds
of
this
continue
again
as
long
as
cola
doesnt
cause
cancer
bill
have
an
even
well
royalty
one
which
i
would
never
bet
against
but
i
dont
feel
i
be
capable
of
assess
probability
about
except
to
the
extent
that
with
a
gun
to
my
head
and
force
to
make
a
guess
i
would
go
with
it
rather
than
against
but
to
calibratre
whether
my
certainty
be
or
say
for
a
year
run
would
be
folly
if
i
have
to
make
such
decision
i
would
do
my
best
but
i
prefer
to
structure
invest
as
a
no
call
strike
game
and
just
wait
for
the
fat
one
i
watch
ted
williams
on
cable
the
other
day
and
he
refer
to
a
book
call
the
science
of
hit
which
i
then
ran
down
it
have
a
draw
of
the
batter
box
in
it
that
he
have
refer
to
on
the
show
with
lot
of
little
square
in
it
all
part
of
the
strike
zone
in
his
favorite
spot
the
box
show
reflect
what
he
felt
he
would
hit
if
he
only
swung
at
pitch
in
that
area
low
and
outsided
but
still
in
the
strike
zone
he
get
down
to
of
course
if
he
have
two
strike
on
him
he
be
go
to
swing
at
that
pitch
but
otherwise
he
wait
for
one
in
the
happy
zone
as
he
put
it
i
think
the
same
approach
make
sense
in
invest
your
happy
zone
because
of
the
business
experience
you
have
have
what
you
see
every
day
your
natural
talent
etc
be
go
to
be
different
than
mine
i
be
sure
moreover
that
you
can
hit
ball
well
in
my
happy
zone
than
i
can
in
yours
just
because
they
be
fatter

let
talk
more
about
this

buffett
do
something
unusual
in
april
with
coke
trading
in
the
low
s
despite
his
general
distaste
for
option
he
write
sell
out
of
the
money
put
option
for
apiece
to
buy
three
million
coca

share
the
option
expire
december
and
be
exercisable
until
then
at
about
a
share
this
meant
he
agree
to
buy
up
to
three
million
share
of
coke
at
about
a
share
in
effect
the
bet
be
that
the
price
would
not
fall
below
a
specific
price
if
the
price
fell
below
a
share
which
it
didn
t
he
would
have
have
to
buy
coke
at
a
price
that
be
more
than
the
open
market
price
at
the
berkshire
annual
meeting
in
april
buffett
confirm
the
move
and
say
he
have
add
another
two
million
share
in
a
similar
move
this
meant
that
buffett
get
million
in
cash
up
front
consequently
have
the
stock
go
down
from
the
roughly
range
where
it
be
then
trading
to
roughly
a
share
he
would
have
have
to
buy
five
million
share
of
coke
at
roughly
that
price
since
buffett
have
already
receive
a
share
his
effective
cost
would
have
be
about
have
coke
fall
below
that
price
buffett
would
have
have
an
unrealized
loss
his
only
risk
under
this
put
contract
be
that
if
coke
stock
drop
below
in
december
he
would
have
have
to
pay
for
the
stock
rather
than
whatever
low
price
coke
be
sell
for
in
the
stock
market
at
the
time
if
the
stock
be
low
he
might
also
have
bought
more
coke
stock
anyway
because
he
be
willing
to
buy
coke
stock
at
a
share
for
buffett
it
be
pretty
much
a
win
win
situation
a
case
of
get
your
cash
and
have
your
coke
stock
too
the
option
work
and
buffett
pocket
the
million
word
of
advice
don
t
try
this
at

unless
you

i

s

bet
the

would

on

it
s
the
begin
of
the

buffett

option
in

take

be
just
not
go
to
sit
well
with
investor
for

buffett
have
argue
that
stock
option
be
an
expense
just
as
surely
as
advertising
or
any
other
expense
since
buffett
have
say
so
in
his
annual
report
once
grant
the
option
be
blind
to
individual
performance
because
it
be
irrevocable
and
unconditional
so
long
as
a
manager
stay
in
the
company
the
sluggard
receives
reward
from
his
option
precisely
as

rip
van

much
of

world
have
wag
war
against
accounting
rule
maker
try
to
keep
the
cost
of
stock
option
from
be
reflect
in
the
profit
of
the
corporation
that
issue
them
typically
executive
have
argue
that
option
be
hard
to
value
and
that
therefore
their
cost
should
be
ignore
but
it
be
both
silly
and
cynical
to
say
that
an
important
item
of
cost
should
not
be
recognize
simply
because
it
can
t
be

no

how
long

which
mean
he
also
do
not

the

what

this

that
these
important
item

should
be

because
they

of
course
not
option

just
not
that
difficult
to
value
in
fact
since
i
m
in
the
mood
for

i
ll
make
one
to
any
executive
who
be
grant
a
restrict
option
even
though
it
may
be
out
of
the
money
on
the
day
of

berkshire
will
pay
him
or
her
a

sum
for
the
right
to
any
future
gain
he
or
she
realizes
on
the

so
if
you
find
a
ceo
who
say
his
newly
issue
option
have
little
or
no
value
tell
him
to
try
us
out
in
truth
we
have
far
more
confidence
in
our
ability
to
determine
an
appropriate
price
to
pay
for
an
option
than
we
have
in
our
ability
to
determine
the
proper
depreciation
rate
for
our
corporate
jet
when
berkshire
acquires
an
option
issue
company
we
promptly
substitute
a
cash
compensation
plan
have
an
economic
value
equivalent
to
that
of
the
previous
option

the
acquiree

true
compensation
cost
be
thereby
brought
out
of
the
closet
and
charge
as
it
should
be
against
earnings
whatever
the
merit
of
option
may
be
their
accounting
treatment
be
outrageous
think
for
a
moment
of
that
million
we
be
go
to
spend
for
advertising
at
geico
this
year
suppose
that
instead
of

cash
for
our
ad
we
paid
the
medium
in
ten
year
at
the
market
berkshire
option
would
anyone
then
care
to
argue
that
berkshire
have
not
borne
a
cost
for
advertising
or
should
not

this
cost

let
s
say
you
be
to
imagine
that
it
be
still
and
you
have
minute
to
plausibly
explain
how
to
go
into
the
beverage
business
and
turn
million
into
trillion
you

by
your
knowledge
of
all
the
progress
of
the
coca
cola
company

you
can

do
it

what
be

educational
implication
these
be
the
question

to
a
group
that
include

munger
s
talk
regard
as
one
of
the
most
brilliant
ever
give
about
business
be
accord
to
munger
himself
not
well
receive
the
title
of
my
talk
be
practical
thought
about
practical
thought
with
a
question
mark
at
the
end
in
a
long
career
i
have
assimilate
various
ultrasimple
general
notion
that
i
find
helpful
in
solve
problem
five
of
these
helpful
notion
i
will
now
describe
after
that
i
will
present
to
you
a
problem
of
extreme
scale
indeed
the
problem
will
involve
turn
start
up
capital
of
two
million
dollar
into
two
trillion
dollar
a
sum
large
enough
to
represent
a
practical
achievement
then
i
will
try
to
solve
the
problem
assist
by
my
helpful
general
notion
follow
that
i
will
suggest
that
there
be
important
educational
implication
in
my
demonstration
i
will
so
finish
because
my
objective
be
educational
my
game
today
be
a
search
for
well
method
of
thought
the
first
helpful
notion
be
that
it
be
usually
best
to
simplify
problem
by
decide
big
no
brainer
question
first
the
second
helpful
notion
mimic
galileo
s
conclusion
that
scientific
reality
be
often
reveal
only
by
math
as
if
math
be
the
language
of
god
galileo
s
attitude
also
work
well
in
messy
practical
life
without
numerical
fluency
in
the
part
of
life
most
of
us
inhabit
you
be
like
a
one
legged
man
in
an
as
kick
contest
the
third
helpful
notion
be
that
it
be
not
enough
to
think
problem
through
forward
you
must
also
think
in
reverse
much
like
the
rustic
who
want
to
know
where
he
be
go
to
die
so
that
he
d
never
go
there
indeed
many
problem
can
t
be
solve
forward
and
that
be
why
the
great
algebraist
carl
jacobi
so
often
say
invert
always
invert
and
why
pythagoras
thought
in
reverse
to
prove
that
the
square
root
of
two
be
an
irrational
number
the
fourth
helpful
notion
be
that
the
best
and
most
practical
wisdom
be
elementary
academic
wisdom
but
there
be
one
extremely
important
qualification
you
must
think
in
a
multidisciplinary
manner
you
must
routinely
use
all
the
easy
to
learn
concept
from
the
freshman
course
in
every
basic
subject
where
elementary
idea
will
serve
your
problem
solve
must
not
be
limited
as
academia
and
many
business
bureaucracy
be
limited
by
extreme
balkanization
into
discipline
and
subdisciplines
with
strong
taboo
against
any
venture
outside
assign
territory
instead
you
must
do
your
multidisciplinary
think
in
accord
with
ben
franklin
s
prescription
in
poor
richard
if
you
want
it
do
go
if
not
send
if
in
your
think
you
rely
entirely
on
others
often
through
purchase
of
professional
advice
whenever
outside
a
small
territory
of
your
own
you
will
suffer
much
calamity
and
it
be
not
just
difficulty
in
complex
coordination
that
will
do
you
in
you
will
also
suffer
from
the
reality
evoke
by
the
shavian
character
who
say
in
the
last
analysis
every
profession
be
a
conspiracy
against
the
laity
indeed
a
shavian
character
for
once
understated
the
horror
of
something
shaw
didn
t
like
it
be
not
usually
the
conscious
malfeasance
of
your
narrow
professional
adviser
that
do
you
in
instead
your
trouble
come
from
his
subconscious
bias
his
cognition
will
often
be
impaired
for
your
purpose
by
financial
incentive
different
from
yours
and
he
will
also
suffer
from
the
psychological
defect
caught
by
the
proverb
to
a
man
with
a
hammer
every
problem
look
like
a
nail
the
fifth
helpful
notion
be
that
really
big
effect
lalapalooza
effect
will
often
come
only
from
large
combination
of
factor
for
instance
tuberculosis
be
tame
at
least
for
a
long
time
only
by
routine
combine
use
in
each
case
of
three
different
drug
and
other
lalapalooza
effect
like
the
flight
of
an
airplane
follow
a
similar
pattern
it
be
now
time
to
present
my
practical
problem
and
here
be
the
problem
it
be
in
atlanta
you
be
brought
along
with
others
like
you
before
a
rich
and
eccentric
atlanta
citizen
name
glotz
both
you
and
glotz
share
two
characteristic
first
you
routinely
use
in
problem
solve
the
five
helpful
notion
and
second
you
know
all
the
elementary
idea
in
all
the
basic
college
course
as
taught
in
however
all
discoverer
and
all
example
demonstrate
these
elementary
idea
come
from
date
transpose
back
before
glotz
know
nothing
about
anything
that
have
happen
after
and
you
must
pretend
that
you
share
his
ignorance
glotz
offer
to
invest
two
million
dollar
yet
take
only
half
the
equity
for
a
glotz
charitable
foundation
in
a
new
corporation
organize
to
go
into
the
non
alcoholic
beverage
business
and
remain
in
that
business
only
forever
glotz
want
to
use
a
name
that
have
somehow
charm
him
coca
cola
the
other
half
of
the
new
corporation
s
equity
will
go
to
the
man
who
most
plausibly
demonstrates
that
his
business
plan
will
cause
glotz
s
foundation
to
be
worth
a
trillion
dollar
year
later
in
the
money
of
the
later
time
despite
pay
out
a
large
part
of
its
earnings
each
year
as
a
dividend
this
will
make
the
whole
new
corporation
worth
two
trillion
dollar
even
after
pay
out
many
billion
of
dollar
in
dividend
you
have
minute
to
make
your
pitch
what
do
you
say
to
glotz
and
here
be
my
solution
my
pitch
to
glotz
use
only
the
helpful
notion
and
what
every
bright
college
sophomore
should
now
know
well
glotz
the
big
no
brainer
decision
that
to
simplify
our
problem
should
be
make
first
be
as
follow
first
we
be
never
go
to
create
something
worth
two
trillion
dollar
by
sell
some
generic
beverage
therefore
we
must
make
your
name
coca
cola
into
a
strong
legally
protect
trademark
second
we
can
get
to
two
trillion
dollar
only
by
start
in
atlanta
then
succeed
in
the
rest
of
the
united
state
then
rapidly
succeed
with
our
new
beverage
all
over
the
world
this
will
require
powerful
elemental
force
and
the
right
place
to
find
such
powerful
elemental
force
be
in
the
subject
matter
of
elementary
academic
course
we
will
next
use
numerical
fluency
to
ascertain
what
our
target
implies
we
can
guess
reasonably
that
by
there
will
be
about
eight
billion
beverage
consumer
in
the
world
on
average
each
of
these
consumer
will
be
much
more
prosperous
in
real
term
than
the
average
consumer
of
each
consumer
be
compose
mostly
of
water
and
must
ingest
about
ounce
of
water
per
day
this
be
eight
eight
ounce
serving
thus
if
our
new
beverage
and
other
imitative
beverage
in
our
new
market
can
flavor
and
otherwise
improve
only
of
ingest
water
worldwide
and
we
can
occupy
half
of
the
new
world
market
we
can
sell
trillion
eight
ounce
serving
in
and
if
we
can
then
net
four
cent
per
serve
we
will
earn
billion
this
will
be
enough
if
our
business
be
still
grow
at
a
good
rate
to
make
it
easily
worth
two
trillion
dollar
a
big
question
of
course
be
whether
four
cent
per
serve
be
a
reasonable
profit
target
for
and
the
answer
be
yes
if
we
can
create
a
beverage
with
strong
universal
appeal
one
hundred
and
fifty
year
be
a
long
time
the
dollar
like
the
roman
greek
drachma
will
almost
surely
suffer
monetary
depreciation
concurrently
real
purchasing
power
of
the
average
beverage
consumer
in
the
world
will
go
way
up
for
reason
well
explain
by
adam
smith
moreover
the
customer
s
proclivity
to
inexpensively
improve
his
experience
while
ingest
water
will
go
up
considerably
faster
meanwhile
as
technology
improves
the
cost
of
our
simple
product
in
unit
of
constant
purchasing
power
will
go
down
all
four
factor
will
work
together
in
favor
of
our
four
cent
per
serve
profit
target
worldwide
beverage
purchasing
power
in
dollar
will
probably
multiply
by
a
factor
of
at
least
over
year
think
in
reverse
this
make
our
profit
per
serve
target
under
condition
a
mere
one
fortieth
of
four
cent
or
one
tenth
of
a
cent
per
serve
this
be
an
easy
to
exceed
target
as
we
start
out
if
our
new
product
have
universal
appeal
that
decide
we
must
next
solve
the
problem
of
invention
to
create
universal
appeal
there
be
two
intertwine
challenge
of
large
scale
first
over
year
we
must
cause
a
new
beverage
market
to
assimilate
about
one
fourth
of
the
world
s
water
ingestion
second
we
must
so
operate
that
half
the
new
market
be
ours
while
all
our
competitor
combine
be
left
to
share
the
remain
half
these
result
be
lalapalooza
result
accordingly
we
must
attack
our
problem
by
cause
every
favorable
factor
we
can
think
of
to
work
for
us
plainly
only
a
powerful
combination
of
many
factor
be
likely
to
cause
the
lalapalooza
consequence
we
desire
fortunately
the
solution
to
these
intertwine
problem
turn
out
to
be
fairly
easy
if
one
have
stayed
awake
in
all
the
freshman
course
let
us
start
by
explore
the
consequence
of
our
simplify
no
brainer
decision
that
we
must
rely
on
a
strong
trademark
this
conclusion
automatically
lead
to
an
understand
of
the
essence
of
our
business
in
proper
elementary
academic
term
we
can
see
from
the
introductory
course
in
psychology
that
in
essence
we
be
go
into
the
business
of
create
and
maintain
condition
reflex
the
coca
cola
trade
name
and
trade
dress
will
act
as
the
stimulus
and
the
purchase
and
ingestion
of
our
beverage
will
be
the
desire
response
and
how
do
one
create
and
maintain
condition
reflex
well
the
psychology
text
give
two
answer
by
operant
conditioning
use
reward
and
by
classical
conditioning
often
call
pavlovian
conditioning
to
honor
the
great
russian
scientist
and
since
we
want
a
lalapalooza
result
we
must
use
both
conditioning
technique
and
all
we
can
invent
to
enhance
effect
from
each
technique
the
operant
conditioning
part
of
our
problem
be
easy
to
solve
we
need
only
maximize
reward
of
our
beverage
s
ingestion
and
minimize
possibility
that
desire
reflex
once
create
by
us
will
be
extinguish
through
operant
conditioning
by
proprietor
of
compete
product
for
operant
conditioning
reward
there
be
only
a
few
category
we
will
find
practical
food
value
in
calorie
or
other
input
flavor
texture
and
aroma
act
as
stimulus
to
consumption
under
neural
pre
program
of
man
through
darwinian
natural
selection
stimulus
as
by
sugar
or
caffeine
cool
effect
when
man
be
too
hot
or
warm
effect
when
man
be
too
cool
want
a
lalapalooza
result
we
will
naturally
include
reward
in
all
the
category
to
start
out
it
be
easy
to
decide
to
design
our
beverage
for
consumption
cold
there
be
much
less
opportunity
without
ingest
beverage
to
counteract
excessive
heat
compare
with
excessive
cold
moreover
with
excessive
heat
much
liquid
must
be
consume
and
the
reverse
be
not
true
it
be
also
easy
to
decide
to
include
both
sugar
and
caffeine
after
all
tea
coffee
and
lemonade
be
already
widely
consume
and
it
be
also
clear
that
we
must
be
fanatic
about
characteristic
that
will
maximize
human
pleasure
while
take
in
the
sugar
water
and
caffeine
we
will
provide
and
to
counteract
possibility
that
desire
operant
condition
reflex
once
create
by
us
will
be
extinguish
by
operant
conditioning
employ
compete
product
there
be
also
an
obvious
answer
we
will
make
it
a
permanent
obsession
in
our
company
that
our
beverage
as
fast
as
practicable
will
at
all
time
be
available
everywhere
throughout
the
world
after
all
a
compete
product
if
it
be
never
try
can
t
act
as
a
reward
create
a
conflict
habit
every
spouse
know
that
we
must
next
consider
the
pavlovian
conditioning
we
must
also
use
in
pavlovian
conditioning
powerful
effect
come
from
mere
association
the
neural
system
of
pavlov
s
dog
cause
it
to
salivate
at
the
bell
it
can
t
eat
and
the
brain
of
man
yearns
for
the
type
of
beverage
held
by
the
pretty
woman
he
can
t
have
and
so
glotz
we
must
use
every
sort
of
decent
honorable
pavlovian
conditioning
we
can
think
of
for
as
long
as
we
be
in
business
our
beverage
and
its
promotion
must
be
associate
in
consumer
mind
with
all
other
thing
consumer
like
or
admire
such
extensive
pavlovian
conditioning
will
cost
a
lot
of
money
particularly
for
advertising
we
will
spend
big
money
as
far
ahead
as
we
can
imagine
but
the
money
will
be
effectively
spent
as
we
expand
fast
in
our
new
beverage
market
our
competitor
will
face
gross
disadvantage
of
scale
in
buying
advertising
to
create
the
pavlovian
conditioning
they
need
and
this
outcome
along
with
other
volume
creates
power
effect
should
help
us
gain
and
hold
at
least
of
the
new
market
everywhere
indeed
provide
buyer
be
scatter
our
high
volume
will
give
us
very
extreme
cost
advantage
in
distribution
moreover
pavlovian
effect
from
mere
association
will
help
us
choose
the
flavor
texture
and
color
of
our
new
beverage
consider
pavlovian
effect
we
will
have
wisely
chosen
the
exotic
and
expensive
sound
name
coca
cola
instead
of
a
pedestrian
name
like
glotz
s
sugar
caffeinated
water
for
similar
pavlovian
reason
it
will
be
wise
to
have
our
beverage
look
pretty
much
like
wine
instead
of
sugar
water
and
so
we
will
artificially
color
our
beverage
if
it
come
out
clear
and
we
will
carbonate
our
water
make
our
product
seem
like
champagne
or
some
other
expensive
beverage
while
also
make
its
flavor
well
and
imitation
harder
to
arrange
for
compete
product
and
because
we
be
go
to
attach
so
many
expensive
psychological
effect
to
our
flavor
that
flavor
should
be
different
from
any
other
standard
flavor
so
that
we
maximize
difficulty
for
competitor
and
give
no
accidental
same
flavor
benefit
to
any
exist
product
what
else
from
the
psychology
textbook
can
help
our
new
business
well
there
be
that
powerful
monkey
see
monkey
do
aspect
of
human
nature
that
psychologist
often
call
social
proof
social
proof
imitative
consumption
trigger
by
mere
sight
of
consumption
will
not
only
help
induce
trial
of
our
beverage
it
will
also
bolster
perceive
reward
from
consumption
we
will
always
take
this
powerful
social
proof
factor
into
account
as
we
design
advertising
and
sale
promotion
and
as
we
forego
present
profit
to
enhance
present
and
future
consumption
more
than
with
most
other
product
increase
sell
power
will
come
from
each
increase
in
sale
we
can
now
see
glotz
that
by
combine
much
pavlovian
conditioning
powerful
social
proof
effect
and
a
wonderful
taste
energy
give
stimulate
and
desirably
cold
beverage
that
cause
much
operant
conditioning
we
be
go
to
get
sale
that
speed
up
for
a
long
time
by
reason
of
the
huge
mixture
of
factor
we
have
chosen
therefore
we
be
go
to
start
something
like
an
autocatalytic
reaction
in
chemistry
precisely
the
sort
of
multi
factor
trigger
lalapalooza
effect
we
need
the
logistics
and
the
distribution
strategy
of
our
business
will
be
simple
there
be
only
two
practical
way
to
sell
our
beverage
as
syrup
to
fountain
and
restaurant
and
as
a
complete
carbonate
water
product
in
container
want
lalapalooza
result
we
will
naturally
do
it
both
way
and
want
huge
pavlovian
and
social
proof
effect
we
will
always
spend
on
advertising
and
sale
promotion
per
serve
over
of
the
fountain
price
for
syrup
need
to
make
the
serve
a
few
syrup
make
plant
can
serve
the
world
however
to
avoid
needle
shipping
of
mere
space
and
water
we
will
need
many
bottle
plant
scatter
over
the
world
we
will
maximize
profit
if
like
early
general
electric
with
light
bulb
we
always
set
the
first
sale
price
either
for
fountain
syrup
or
for
any
container
of
our
complete
product
the
best
way
to
arrange
this
desirable
profit
maximize
control
be
to
make
any
independent
bottler
we
need
a
subcontractor
not
a
vendee
of
syrup
and
certainly
not
a
vendee
of
syrup
under
a
perpetual
franchise
specify
a
syrup
price
frozen
forever
at
its
start
level
be
unable
to
get
a
patent
or
copyright
on
our
superimportant
flavor
we
will
work
obsessively
to
keep
our
formula
secret
we
will
make
a
big
hoopla
over
our
secrecy
which
will
enhance
pavlovian
effect
eventually
food
chemical
engineering
will
advance
so
that
our
flavor
can
be
copy
with
near
exactitude
but
by
that
time
we
will
be
so
far
ahead
with
such
strong
trademark
and
complete
always
available
worldwide
distribution
that
good
flavor
copying
won
t
bar
us
from
our
objective
moreover
the
advance
in
food
chemistry
that
help
competitor
will
almost
surely
be
accompany
by
technological
advance
that
will
help
us
include
refrigeration
well
transportation
and
for
dieter
ability
to
insert
a
sugar
taste
without
insert
sugar
s
calorie
also
there
will
be
related
beverage
opportunity
we
will
seize
this
brings
us
to
a
final
reality
check
for
our
business
plan
we
will
once
more
think
in
reverse
like
jacobi
what
must
we
avoid
because
we
don
t
want
it
four
answer
seem
clear
first
we
must
avoid
the
protective
cloy
stop
consumption
effect
of
aftertaste
that
be
a
standard
part
of
physiology
developed
through
darwinian
evolution
to
enhance
the
replication
of
man
s
gene
by
force
a
generally
helpful
moderation
on
the
gene
carrier
to
serve
our
end
on
hot
day
a
consumer
must
be
able
to
drink
container
after
container
of
our
product
with
almost
no
impediment
from
aftertaste
we
will
find
a
wonderful
no
aftertaste
flavor
by
trial
and
error
and
will
thereby
solve
this
problem
second
we
must
avoid
ever
lose
even
half
of
our
powerful
trademarked
name
it
will
cost
us
mightily
for
instance
if
our
sloppiness
should
ever
allow
sale
of
any
other
kind
of
cola
for
instance
a
peppy
cola
if
there
be
ever
a
peppy
cola
we
will
be
the
proprietor
of
the
brand
third
with
so
much
success
come
we
must
avoid
bad
effect
from
envy
give
a
prominent
place
in
the
ten
commandment
because
envy
be
so
much
a
part
of
human
nature
the
best
way
to
avoid
envy
recognize
by
aristotle
be
to
plainly
deserve
the
success
we
get
we
will
be
fanatic
about
product
quality
quality
of
product
presentation
and
reasonableness
of
price
consider
the
harmless
pleasure
we
will
provide
fourth
after
our
trademarked
flavor
dominates
our
new
market
we
must
avoid
make
any
huge
and
sudden
change
in
our
flavor
even
if
a
new
flavor
performs
well
in
blind
taste
test
change
to
that
new
flavor
would
be
a
foolish
thing
to
do
this
follow
because
under
such
condition
our
old
flavor
will
be
so
entrench
in
consumer
preference
by
psychological
effect
that
a
big
flavor
change
would
do
us
little
good
and
it
would
do
immense
harm
by
trigger
in
consumer
the
standard
deprival
super
reaction
syndrome
that
make
take
aways
so
hard
to
get
in
any
type
of
negotiation
and
help
make
most
gambler
so
irrational
moreover
such
a
large
flavor
change
would
allow
a
competitor
by
copying
our
old
flavor
to
take
advantage
of
both
the
hostile
consumer
super
reaction
to
deprival
and
the
huge
love
of
our
original
flavor
create
by
our
previous
work
well
that
be
my
solution
to
my
own
problem
of
turn
two
million
dollar
into
two
trillion
dollar
even
after
pay
out
billion
of
dollar
in
dividend
i
think
it
would
have
won
with
glotz
in
and
should
convince
you
more
than
you
expect
at
the
outset
after
all
the
correct
strategy
be
clear
after
be
related
to
elementary
academic
idea
brought
into
play
by
the
helpful
notion
how
consistent
be
my
solution
with
the
history
of
the
real
coca
cola
company
well
as
late
as
year
after
the
fictional
glotz
be
to
start
vigorously
with
two
million
dollar
the
real
coca
cola
company
have
a
net
worth
under
thousand
and
earnings
of
about
zero
and
thereafter
the
real
coca
cola
company
do
lose
half
its
trademark
and
do
grant
perpetual
bottle
franchise
at
fix
syrup
price
and
some
of
the
bottler
be
not
very
effective
and
couldn
t
easily
be
change
and
the
real
coca
cola
company
with
this
system
do
lose
much
pricing
control
that
would
have
improve
result
have
it
be
retain
yet
even
so
the
real
coca
cola
company
follow
so
much
of
the
plan
give
to
glotz
that
it
be
now
worth
about
billion
and
will
have
to
increase
its
value
at
only
per
year
until
to
reach
a
value
of
two
trillion
dollar
and
it
can
hit
an
annual
physical
volume
target
of
trillion
serving
if
serving
grow
until
at
only
per
year
a
result
consistent
with
much
past
experience
and
leave
plenty
of
plain
water
ingestion
for
coca
cola
to
replace
after
so
i
would
guess
that
the
fictional
glotz
start
earlier
and
strong
and
avoid
the
bad
error
would
have
easily
hit
his
two
trillion
dollar
target
and
he
would
have
do
it
well
before
this
brings
me
at
last
to
the
main
purpose
of
my
talk
large
educational
implication
exist
if
my
answer
to
glotz
s
problem
be
roughly
right
and
you
make
one
more
assumption
i
believe
true
that
most
ph
d
educator
even
psychology
professor
and
business
school
dean
would
not
have
give
the
same
simple
answer
i
do
and
if
i
be
right
in
these
two
way
this
would
indicate
that
our
civilization
now
keep
in
place
a
great
many
educator
who
can
t
satisfactorily
explain
coca
cola
even
in
retrospect
and
even
after
watch
it
closely
all
their
life
this
be
not
a
satisfactory
state
of
affair
moreover
and
this
result
be
even
more
extreme
the
brilliant
and
effective
executive
who
surround
by
business
school
and
law
school
graduate
have
run
the
coca
cola
company
with
glorious
success
in
recent
year
also
do
not
understand
elementary
psychology
well
enough
to
predict
and
avoid
the
new
coke
fiasco
which
dangerously
threaten
their
company
that
people
so
talented
surround
by
professional
adviser
from
the
best
university
should
thus
demonstrate
a
huge
gap
in
their
education
be
also
not
a
satisfactory
state
of
affair
such
extreme
ignorance
in
both
the
high
reach
of
academia
and
the
high
reach
of
business
be
a
lalapalooza
effect
of
a
negative
sort
demonstrate
grave
defect
in
academia
because
the
bad
effect
be
lalapalooza
we
should
expect
to
find
intertwine
multiple
academic
cause
i
suspect
at
least
two
such
cause
first
academic
psychology
while
it
be
admirable
and
useful
as
a
list
of
ingenious
and
important
experiment
lack
interdisciplinary
synthesis
in
particular
not
enough
attention
be
give
to
lalapalooza
effect
come
from
combination
of
psychological
tendency
this
creates
a
situation
remind
one
of
a
rustic
teacher
who
try
to
simplify
school
work
by
round
pi
to
an
even
three
and
it
violates
einstein
s
injunction
that
everything
should
be
make
as
simple
as
possible
but
no
more
simple
in
general
psychology
be
laid
out
and
misunderstood
as
electromagnetism
would
now
be
misunderstood
if
physic
have
produce
many
brilliant
experimenter
like
michael
faraday
and
no
grand
synthesizer
like
james
clerk
maxwell
and
second
there
be
a
truly
horrible
lack
of
synthesis
blending
psychology
and
other
academic
subject
but
only
an
interdisciplinary
approach
will
correctly
deal
with
reality
in
academia
as
with
the
coca
cola
company
in
short
academic
psychology
department
be
immensely
more
important
and
useful
than
other
academic
department
think
and
at
the
same
time
the
psychology
department
be
bad
than
most
of
their
inhabitant
think
it
be
of
course
normal
for
self
appraisal
to
be
more
positive
than
external
appraisal
indeed
a
problem
of
this
sort
may
have
give
you
your
speaker
today
but
the
size
of
this
psychology
department
gap
be
preposterously
large
in
fact
the
gap
be
so
enormous
that
one
very
eminent
university
chicago
at
one
time
simply
abolish
its
psychology
department
perhaps
with
an
undisclosed
hope
of
later
create
a
well
version
in
such
a
state
of
affair
many
year
ago
and
with
much
that
be
plainly
wrong
already
present
the
new
coke
fiasco
occur
wherein
coke
s
executive
come
to
the
brink
of
destroy
the
most
valuable
trademark
in
the
world
the
academically
correct
reaction
to
this
immense
and
well
publicize
fiasco
would
have
be
the
sort
of
reaction
boeing
would
display
if
three
of
its
new
airplane
crashed
in
a
single
week
after
all
product
integrity
be
involve
in
each
case
and
the
plain
educational
failure
be
immense
but
almost
no
such
responsible
boeing
like
reaction
have
come
from
academia
instead
academia
by
and
large
continue
in
its
balkanize
way
to
tolerate
psychology
professor
who
mi
teach
psychology
non
psychology
professor
who
fail
to
consider
psychological
effect
obviously
crucial
in
their
subject
matter
and
professional
school
that
carefully
preserve
psychological
ignorance
come
in
with
each
enter
class
and
be
proud
of
their
inadequacy
even
though
this
regrettable
blindness
and
lassitude
be
now
the
normal
academic
result
be
there
exception
provide
hope
that
disgraceful
shortcoming
of
the
educational
establishment
will
eventually
be
correct
here
my
answer
be
a
very
optimistic
yes
for
instance
consider
the
recent
behavior
of
the
economics
department
of
the
university
of
chicago
over
the
last
decade
this
department
have
enjoy
a
near
monopoly
of
the
nobel
prize
in
economics
largely
by
get
good
prediction
out
of
free
market
model
postulate
man
s
rationality
and
what
be
the
reaction
of
this
department
after
win
so
steadily
with
its
rational
man
approach
well
it
just
invite
into
a
precious
slot
amid
its
company
of
great
a
wise
and
witty
cornell
economist
richard
thaler
and
it
have
do
this
because
thaler
poke
fun
at
much
that
be
holy
at
the
university
of
chicago
indeed
thaler
believe
with
me
that
people
be
often
massively
irrational
in
way
predict
by
psychology
that
must
be
take
into
account
in
microeconomics
in
so
behaving
the
university
of
chicago
be
imitate
darwin
who
spent
much
of
his
long
life
think
in
reverse
as
he
try
to
disprove
his
own
hardest
won
and
best
love
idea
and
so
long
as
there
be
part
of
academia
that
keep
alive
its
best
value
by
think
in
reverse
like
darwin
we
can
confidently
expect
that
silly
educational
practice
will
eventually
be
replace
by
well
one
exactly
as
carl
jacobi
might
have
predict
this
will
happen
because
the
darwinian
approach
with
its
habitual
objectivity
take
on
as
a
sort
of
hair
shirt
be
a
mighty
approach
indeed
no
less
a
figure
than
einstein
say
that
one
of
the
four
cause
of
his
achievement
be
self
criticism
rank
right
up
there
alongside
curiosity
concentration
and
perseverance
and
to
far
appreciate
the
power
of
self
criticism
consider
where
lie
the
grave
of
that
very
ungifted
undergraduate
charles
darwin
it
be
in
westminster
abbey
right
next
to
the
headstone
of
isaac
newton
perhaps
the
most
gift
student
who
ever
live
honor
on
that
headstone
in
eight
latin
word
constitute
the
most
eloquent
praise
in
all
graveyard
print
hic
depositum
est
quod
mortale
fruit
isaaci
newtoni
here
lie
that
which
be
mortal
of
isaac
newton
a
civilization
that
so
place
a
dead
darwin
will
eventually
develop
and
integrate
psychology
in
a
proper
and
practical
fashion
that
greatly
increase
skill
of
all
sort
but
all
of
us
who
have
dollop
of
power
and
see
the
light
should
help
the
process
along
there
be
a
lot
at
stake
if
in
many
high
place
a
universal
product
as
successful
as
coca
cola
be
not
properly
understood
and
explain
it
can
t
bode
well
for
our
competency
in
deal
with
much
else
that
be
important
of
course
those
of
you
with
of
net
worth
in
coca
cola
stock
occur
because
you
try
to
invest
after
think
like
i
do
in
make
my
pitch
to
glotz
can
ignore
my
message
about
psychology
as
too
elementary
for
useful
transmission
to
you
but
i
be
not
so
sure
that
this
reaction
be
wise
for
the
rest
of
you
the
situation
reminds
me

the

well
as
eat
it
he
picked
up

a
little
and

the
same
whether
in

u
s
or
asia
the
meat
be
the

a
coke
junkie
so

of
the
coke
buffett
joked
it
might
be
a
slightly
richer
mixture
for
my
taste
but
it
ll
do
i
be
talk
to
him
like
any
other
person
it
be
hard
to
believe
these
be
the
two
richest
people
in
the
world
langdon
say

way
casual
but
i
didn
t
know
gate
be
he
be
kind
of
the
same
way
langdon
be
struck
that
they

water
by

it
may
sound
goofy
but
here
s
how
the
megadeal
occur
eisner
bumping
into
buffett
on
his
way
to
a
golf
game
with
murphy
ask
buffett
if
cap
city
be
for
sale
buffett
say
i
think
so
let
s
ask
murphy
here
s
eisner
s
version
of
the
event
from
his
book
work
in
progress
p
i
be
still
digest
the
conversation
with
larry
tisch
about
the
possibility
of
buying
cbs
when
i
look
up
and
saw
warren
buffett
come
toward
me
he
too
stop
to
tell
me
how
impressed
he
have
be
by
our
presentation
the
funniest
thing
just
happen
i
told
him
i
ran
into
larry
tisch
and
we
end
up
talk
about
our
buying
cbs
unless
of
course
you
want
to
sell
us
cap
city
for
cash
i
be
hop
that
the
possibility
of
disney
s
buying
cbs
might
make
buffett
the
large
shareholder
in
cap
city
more
eager
to
sell
the
company
sound
good
to
me
he
say
without
hesitation
why
don
t
we
go
talk
to
tom
about
it
he
be
refer
to
tom
murphy
i
don
t
know
where
he
be
i
say
i
m
just
go
to
meet
him
buffett
told
me
we
have
a
date
to
play
golf
with
bill
gate
why
don
t
you
walk
over
with
me
when
we
caught
up
with
murphy
buffett
make
the
pitch
for
me
michael
want
to
pay
cash
for
cap
city
he
say
i
think
he
s

any
time
we
ever
bought
anything
at
berkshire
that
work
out
it
be
in
cash
what
do
you
think

murphy
seem
slightly
take
aback
just
three
month
have
pass
since
our
last
negotiation
end
unsuccessfully
i
d
have
to
think
about
it
he
say

talk
some
more
about
the
deal
and
i
slip
in
as
casually
as
possible
the
story
about
what
have
just
occur
with

murphy
knew
that
we
be
seriously
interested

whatever
doubt

of
the
few
potential

the
wesco
management
feel
about
us
we
decide
in
some
quixotic
moment
that
it
be
the
right
way
to
behave
munger
say
warren
boroson
pick
stock
like
warren
buffett
p
because
the
sec
thought
something
be
rotten
in
denmark
they
want
to
look
fair
to
vincente
and
peter
munger
explain
munger
want
to
buy
more
share
of
wesco
to
fight
off
the
merger
but
buffett
do
not
munger
prevail
and
for
six
week
blue
chip
bought
every
wesco
share
it
could
find
accumulate
of
the
company
in
order
for
shareholder
to
vote
down
the
merger
buffett
and
munger
have
to
persuade
san
francisco
heiress
and
napa
valley
vineyard
owner
elizabeth
peter
and
her
family
to
go
along
buffett
talk
peter
into
voting
against
the
merger
at
that
point
buffett
and
munger
could
legally
buy
up
to
of
the
company
and
they
begin
do
so
at
about
a
share
know
the
stock
would
decline
in
after
a
two
year
investigation
the
sec
charge
that
blue
chip
have
propped
up
the
price
of
wesco
by
insist
on
buying
share
at
a
high
than
market
price
the
sec
have
be
track
all
the
criss
cross
ownership
and
thought
some
manipulation
might
be
go
on
the
case
be
settle
by
blue
chip
give
wesco
shareholder
janet
lowe
damn
right
pp
in
the
end
wesco
be
consolidated
with
blue
chip
and
eventually
merge
into
berkshire
at
the
berkshire
shareholder
meeting
in
munger
say
year
ago
before
warren
and
i
bought
any
stock
blue
chip
stamp
mail
minor
amount
of
blue
chip
stock
out
to
fill
station
operator
as
a
class
action
settlement
of
some
kind
my
wife
told
the
guy
where
she
get
her
car
wash
to
hold
onto
it
well
the
other
day
he
drag
her
out
of
the
car
and
kiss
her
so
maybe
we
should
buy
into
another
die
business
in
some
former
blue
chip
shareholder
sue
berkshire
say
their
share
have
become
lose
in
transfer
agent
record
they
be
unaware
of
the
merger
between
blue
chip
and
berkshire
in
which
make
them
berkshire
shareholder
and
they
have
later
be
damage
by
have
their
berkshire
share
transfer
to
various
state
under
escheat
law
but
escheat
be
reversible
each
of
the
sue
shareholder
have
be
able
to
recover
about
per
lose
berkshire
share
by
reverse
escheat
to
the
state
of
california
therefore
most
or
all
these
shareholder
have
thus
be
lucky
that
they
have
become
lose
this
force
their
retention
of
berkshire
share
during
a
long
hold
period
while
the
share
price
increase
by
over
thirtyfold
to
the
roughly
per

they
recover
late
in
the

threw
out
this

litigation
against
berkshire
ruling
that
the
litigation
be

in
an

november
buffett
say
of
buying

draw
a
circle
around
the

you
understand
and
then
eliminate
those
that
fail
to

on
the
basis
of

good
management
and
limited

time
no
high

no

i
don

buy

it
not
because
you
want
the

go
up

simple
he

add
that

blue

cheap
when
the
difficulty
of
make
much
money
from

weak

about

wesco
have
not
enjoy
fast
growth
nor
have
it
found
enough
of
the
right
acquisition
in

s
report
munger
say
it
have
be
difficult
for
wesco
to
find
good
acquisition
candidate
and
he
liken
that
search
to
catch
muskies
to
wesco
as
a
non
lbo
operator
the
good
corporate
acquisition
game
be
always
tough
and
that
game
in
each
recent
year
have
become
more
like
fishing
for
muskies
at

lake
in

the
writer

more

this

you

have
you
caught
none
munger
say
wesco
continue
to
try
more
to
profit
from
always
remember
the
obvious
than
from
grasp
the
esoteric
it
be
remarkable
how
much
long
term
advantage
people
like
us
have
gotten
by
try
to
be
consistently
not
stupid
instead
of
try
to
be
very
intelligent
there
must
be
some
wisdom
in
the
folk
say
it
s
the
strong
swimmer
who
drown
in
a
sting
letter
from
munger
wesco
resign
from
the

protest
of
the

s
reluctance
to
call
for
proper
reform
in
light
of
the
national
s
l
crisis
write
munger
it
be
not
unfair
to
liken
the
situation
now
face
congress
to
cancer
and
to
liken
the
league
to
a
significant
carcinogenic
agent
and
like
cancer
our
present
trouble
will
recur
if
congress
lack
the
wisdom
and
courage
to
excise
element
which
cause
the
trouble
wesco
be
a
steady
if
unglamorous
part
of
berkshire
and
perhaps
can
be
thought
of
as
have
the
safety
and
steady
return
of
a

market
account
in

a

once
suggest
to

he
might
want
to
turn
wesco
into
a

market
account
munger
do
not
totally
dismiss
the
idea
that
do
not
suggest
he
be
about
to
liquidate
but
then
munger
have
no
problem
with
cash
in
the

earn
sure
money
either
munger

influence
him
greatly
about
be

munger
also
say
the
business
that
berkshire
have
acquire
will
return
pre

on
what
we
paid
for
them
maybe
more
with
a
cost
of
capital
of
generate
via
other
people
s
money
in
the
form
of
float
that
s
a
hell
of
a
business
that
s
the
reason
berkshire
shareholder
needn
t
totally
despair
berkshire
be
not
as
good
as
it
be
in
term
of
percentage
compound
go
forward
but
it
s
still
a
hell
of
a
business
at
wesco
s
annual
meeting
in
munger
say
personally
i
think
berkshire
will
be
a
lot
big
and
a
lot
strong
than
it
be
whether
the
stock
will
be
a
good
investment
from
today
s
price
be
another
question
the
one
thing
we
ve
always
guaranteed
be
that
the
future
will
be
a
lot
bad
than
the
past
wesco
be
consolidated
within
berkshire
for

holding
such
as
coca

be
reflect
in
berkshire
s
total
buying
the
rest
of
wesco
berkshire
confirm
in
early
that
it
plan
to
buy
the
remain
of
the
wesco
share
it
didn
t
already
own
for
million
or
a
share
berkshire
paid
for
the
share
with
both
berkshire
class
b

specifically
with

in

and

have
bought
about

call
blue
chip
stamp
co
which
itself
later
become
part
of
berkshire
today
all
of
wesco
be
worth
about
billion
at
one
point
in
the
negotiation
for
wesco
buffett
write
in
a
january
letter
to
wesco
board
member
carolyn
carlburg
that
the
transaction
be
disadvantageous
to
berkshire
assume
a
large
number
of
wesco
shareholder
opt
for
berkshire
stock
i
believe
the
prospect
for
berkshire
share
over
the
next
ten
year
to
be
considerably
well
than
the
prospect
for

economic
prospect
of
the

the

the

to

we
make
the
right
decision
for
us

have
a
very
slow
start
after

add

follow
be
excerpt
from
the

report
of

write
by
charles
munger
our
own
subsidiary
buffalo
even
news
inc
be
acquire
in
april
for
approximately
million
it
now
constitutes
only
approximately
million
of
our
consolidated
net
worth
as
a
result
of
about
million
of
aggregate
after
tax
operating
loss
after
acquisition
this
translates
roughly
into
million
of
aggregate
operating
loss
before
tax
however
the
operating
loss
before
tax
of
the
news
in
be
low
than
that
of
have
decline
to
from
in
the
previous
year
which
in
turn
have
decline
from
in
we
predict
accurately
the
financial
improvement
in
and
for
we
confidently
predict
a
lack
of
improvement
we
anticipate
terrible
market
condition
for
the
news
in
economic
force
be
at
work
which
be
plainly
beyond
anyone
s
control
and
we
be
catch
at
least
our
share
of
a
widespread
malaise
we
know
of
no
easy
solution
it
be
of
course
a
temptation
when
write
an
annual
letter
to
shareholder
to
gloss
over
difficulty
like
those
in
buffalo
and
comment
extensively
concern
success
we
recommend
exactly
the
opposite
emphasis
to
business
manager
who
report
to
us
and
we
believe
in
practice
what
we
preach
accordingly
year
after
year
we
re
tell
and
extend
the
history
of
the
news
create
the
large
single
section
of
our
annual
letter
this
year
we
surpass
all
previous
record
while
convention
doesn
t
require
reporting
of
opportunity
cost
loss
to
shareholder
we
believe
they
be
just
as
important
as
conventional
report
loss
and
should
be
face
just
as
squarely
if
we
hadn
t
purchase
the
news
in
but
have
simply
earn
return
on
the
unspent
purchase
price
comparable
with
the
average
earn
power
of
the
rest
of
our
shareholder
equity
we
would
now
have
about
million
in
value
of
other
asset
earn
over
million
per
year
in
place
of
the
buffalo
even
news
and
its
current
red
ink
no
matter
what
happens
in
the
future
in
buffalo
we
be
about
sure
to
have
an
economic
place
low
than
we
would
have
occupy
if
we
have
not
make
our
purchase
the
news
remains
a
salable
property
even
with
its
current
trouble
so
long
as
its
share
of
circulation
and
advertising
be
stable
to
inch
ahead
and
we
could
easily
improve
our
consolidated
operating
earnings
and
the
percentage
return
we
earn
on
our
shareholder
investment
by
sell
the
news
and
reinvesting
the
proceeds
after
tax
effect
in
profit
earn
asset
that
we
be
not
even
slightly
tempt
to
do
so
demonstrates
our
conviction
that
buffalo
will
have
a
reasonably
felicitous
future
as
a
city
and
that
the
fine
people
who
work
at
the
news
will
ultimately
succeed
in
make
it
a
sound
business
for
its
owner
and
employee
through
continued
provision
of
sound
service
to
its
customer
we
still
plan
to
stay
with
the
news
until
it
either
expires
or
far
more
likely
becomes
a
solid
earner
and
employer
buffett
see
that
the
buffalo
paper
might
be
a
good
business
if
it
could
launch

sunday
edition
bought

a
few
week
prior
to
finalize
the
sale
of
the
news
to
blue
chip
i
met
with
buffett
and
munger
in
the
editorial
conference
room
next
to
my
office
early
on
in
that
meeting
buffett
ask
my
feel
about
a
sunday
paper
which
the
news
have
not
publish
since
my
response
be
that
i
felt
very
strongly
about
the
need
for
a
sunday
publication
give
that
every
study
indicate
that
the
sunday
edition
of
newspaper
be
gain
in
circulation
and
advertising
and
be
in
effect
offset
the
loss
in
the
revenue
stream
from
their
daily
operation
p
the
news
quickly
decide
to
launch
a
sunday
paper
and
do
so
in
november
its
special
introductory
offer
to
subscriber
and
advertiser
brought
a
swift
reaction
a
lawsuit
on
the
ground
the
introductory
practice
be
improper
from
its
competitor
the
morning
buffalo
courier
express
and
later
from
a
cowles
medium
paper
that
publish
seven
day
a
week
the
news
eventually
beat
back
the
lawsuit
but
both
paper
continued
to
lose
money
for
year
from
the
time
of
buffett
s
purchase
in
the
news
lose
about
million
before
tax
through
december
however
on
september
the
courier
express
fold
and
what
buffett
have
on
his
hand
be
a
flourish
monopoly
his
favorite
kind
of
business
the
news
begin
put
out
a
morning
edition
and
today
the
successful
paper
publishes
sunday
and
eight
additional

he

i
hear
this
quite
a
bit
so
i
ask
him
to
write
me
buffett
say
helzberg
say
i
walk
over
to
buffett
and
we
have
a
very
detailed
second
meeting
later
a
deal
be
struck
so
how
do
one
negotiate
with
buffett
about
the
sale
of
a
business
say
helzberg
basically
the
way
to
negotiate
with
warren
buffett
you
don
t
negotiate
he
tell
you
the
deal
and
that
s
the
deal
you
accept
or
walk
away
helzberg
jr
former
chairman
and
owner
of
helzberg
diamond
say
buffett
s
deal
be
fair
and
be
particularly
attractive
because
buffett
promise
to
retain
the
employee
and
keep
the
business
intact
i
do
not
want
a
lot
of
people
spit
on
my
grave
helzberg
say
my
dream
buyer
for
the
family
business
all
along
be
warren
buffett
i
knew
we
could
trust
him
to
keep
the
headquarters
in
kansa
city
resist
change
the
company
character
and
retain
the
job
of
all
helzberg
s
associate
it
might
have
be
simpler
to
sell
to
the
high
bidder
but
that
notion
seem
as
sensible
as
choose
a
brain
surgeon
base
on
the
low
price
rather
than
on
talent
and
reputation
this
can
be
the
fast
deal
in
history
buffett
say
but
what
about
due
diligence
i
ask
surprised
at
how
fast
the
negotiation
be
move
most
suitor
demand
to
see
every
scrap

whose
grandfather

the

in
the
first

morris

offer
to
spend
fix
up
the

if
he
could
raise
the

from
to
a
month
after
much
deliberation
the
family
decide
to
accept
the
offer
from
the
outset
the
concern
of
the
small

belong
to
the

serious
matter
such
as
the
rise
in

a

of
my
father

could
have
guess
that
ownership
of
both
their
company
would
partially
or
even
totally
wind
up
with
buffett
helzberg
say
that
berkshire
s
ownership
of
his
business
would
allow
the
jewelry
firm
continued
growth
and
continuity
of
its
culture
also
it
would
assure
that
the
headquarters
remain
in
kansa
city
and
would
allow
helzberg
time
to
pursue
nonprofit
community
interest
helzberg
say
i
be
extremely
pleased
with
the
fact
that
we
have
be
able
to
take
a
three
generation
business
and
allow
it
to
continue
its
growth
and
prosperity
under
the
respect
umbrella
of
berkshire
hathaway
i
believe
this
ownership
change
be
a
win
for
the
associate
of
helzberg
s
diamond
shop
a
win
for
the
investor
of
berkshire
hathaway
a
win
for
our
family
and
most
importantly
a
win
for
the
customer
of
our
fine
company
buffett
say
i
be
proud
that
berkshire

be
add
helzberg

i
have
great
confidence
in
the
present
management
team
the
talent
pool
represent
by
the
helzberg
management
and
its
associate
be
one
of
the
reason
i
place
such
a
high
value
on
this
acquisition
it
go
without
say
that
the
long
term
financial
stability
and
very
bright
outlook
for
the
future
of
helzberg

be
also
major

say
that
i

and
that
i

the

by
mormon
doesn
t
open
on
sunday
in
berkshire
s
annual
report
buffett
told
a
story
about
bill
child
s
desire
to
open
a
new
store
in
boise
idaho
i
be
highly
skeptical
about
take
a
no
sunday
policy
into
a
territory
where
we
would
be
up
against
entrench
rival
open
seven
day
a
week
nevertheless
this
be
bill
s
business
to
run
so
despite
my
reservation
i
told
him
to
follow
both
his
business
judgment
and
his
religious
conviction
bill
then
insist
on
a
truly
extraordinary
proposition
he
would
personally
buy
the
land
and
build
the
store
for
about
million
as
it
turn
out
and
would
sell
it
to
us
at
his
cost
if
it
prove
to
be
successful
on
the
other
hand
if
sale
fell
short
of
his
expectation
we
could
exit
the
business
without
pay
bill
a
cent
this
outcome
of
course
would
leave
him
with
a
huge
investment
in
an
empty
building
i
told
him
that
i
appreciate
his
offer
but
felt
that
if
berkshire
be
go
to
get
the
upside
it
should
also
take
the
downside
bill
say
nothing
do
if
there
be
to
be
failure
because
of
his
religious
belief
he
want
to
take
the
blow
personally
the
store
open
last
august
and
immediately
become
a
huge
success
bill
thereupon
turn
the
property
over
to
us
include
some
extra
land
that
have
appreciate
significantly
and
we
write
him
a
check
for
his
cost
and
get
this
bill
refuse
to
take
a
dime
of
interest
on
the
capital
he
have
tie
up
over
the
two
year
a
footnote
after
our
soft
opening
in
august
we
have
a
grand
opening
of
the
boise
store
about
a
month
later
naturally
i
go
there
to
cut
the
ribbon
your
chairman
i
wish
to
emphasize
be
good
for
something
in
my
talk

told
the

that

could
make

work
with

buffett

i
like
and
admire
al

will
fit
perfectly

on
may
he
say
i
be
proud
of
this
company
of
its
people
and
of
what
they
do
at
flightsafety
we
believe
we
ve
help
our
customer
in
their
quest
for
safe
reliable
transportation
and
in
do
that
we
ve
help
save
life
as
a
matter
of
course
know
that
make
it
fun
to
go
to
work
every
day
and
help
me
to
sleep
like
a
baby
at
night
in
recent
year
i
become
concerned
that
once
i
exit
the
stage
say
maybe
a
hundred
year
from
now
the
company
that
we
ve
built
so
carefully
and
so
well
could
be
take
over
and
parcel
out
by
outsider
i
didn
t
want
that
to
happen
but
wasn
t
sure
what
to
do
about
it
fortunately
my
good
luck
held
once
again
warren
buffett
call
although
warren
have
be
send
his
pilot
to
us
for
training
he
and
i
have
never
met
so
the
contact
come
as
a
surprise
he
want
to
know
if
i
d
be
interested
in
discuss
flightsafety
s
future
i
be
so
one
afternoon
in
late
we
met
in
new
york
city
we
get
to
know
each
other
over
a
couple
of
hamburger
and
cherry
coke
and
i
like
what
i
saw
and
heard
warren
say
he
d
like
flightsafety
to
be
a
part
of
berkshire
hathaway
but
he
want
it
to
remain
an
independent
subsidiary
to
continue
on
its
same
course
of
business
and
to
be
run
by
the
same
people
as
before
at
the
end
of
the
meal
the
best
burger
i
d
eat
since
sell
little
hawk
we
shook
hand
on
the
deal
and
by
the
end
of
december
it
be
do
flightsafety
become
a
wholly
own
subsidiary
of
berkshire
hathaway
and
i
could
not
be
more
pleased
buffett
have
say
ueltschi
call
the
shot
at
flightsafety
not

with
it

up
his
courage
get
the
idea
out
and
waugh
latch
onto
it
immediately
waugh
say
that
something
have
to
happen
at
flightsafety
since
al

there
be
uncertainty

sercer
told
waugh
that
in
his
opinion
berkshire
would
keep
the
current
management
and
let
them
run
the
business
the
way
they
saw
fit
the
only
difference
would
be
that
the
owner
earnings
would
go
to
omaha
for
reinvestment
in
the
insurance
business
equity
or

t
take
business
from
another
i
ask

this

will
be
unusual
first
i
will
write
it
almost
as
if
it
be
a
letter
second
it
will
contain
two
set
of
fact
both
about
dave
sokol
chairman
of
several
berkshire
subsidiary
late
in
the
day
on

i
receive
a
letter
of
resignation
from
dave
deliver
by
his
assistant
his
reason
be
as
follow
as
i
have
mention
to
you
in
the
past
it
be
my
goal
to
utilize
the
time
remain
in
my
career
to
invest
my
family
s
resource
in
such
a
way
as
to
create
endure
equity
value
and
hopefully
an
enterprise
which
will
provide
opportunity
for
my
descendent
and
funding
for
my
philanthropic
interest
i
have
no
more
detailed
plan
than
this
because
my
obligation
from
berkshire
hathaway
have
be
my
first
and
only
business
priority
i
have
not
ask
for
his
resignation
and
it
come
as
a
surprise
to
me
twice
before
most
recently
two
or
so
year
ago
dave
have
talk
to
me
of
resign
in
each
case
he
have
give
me
the
same
reason
that
he
laid
out
in
his
monday
letter
both
time
i
and
other
board
member
persuade
him
to
stay
berkshire
be
far
more
valuable
today
because
we
be
successful
in
those
effort
dave
s
contribution
have
be
extraordinary
at
midamerican
he
and
greg
abel
have
deliver
the
best
performance
of
any
manager
in
the
public
utility
field

dave
resurrect
an
operation
that
be
destine
for
bankruptcy
absent
berkshire
s
deep
pocket
he
have
be
of
enormous
help
in
the
operation
of
john
manville
where
he
instal
new
management
some
year
ago
and
oversaw
major
change
finally
dave
brought
the
idea
for
purchasing
lubrizol
to
me
on
either
january
or
initially
i
be
unimpressed
but
after
his
report
of
a
january
talk
with
its
ceo
james
hambrick
i
quickly
warm
to
the
idea
though
the
offer
to
purchase
be
entirely
my
decision
support
by
berkshire
s
board
on
march
it
would
not
have
occur
without
dave
s
early
effort
that
brings
us
to
our
second
set
of
fact
in
our
first
talk
about
lubrizol
dave
mention
that
he
own
stock
in
the
company
it
be
a
passing
remark
and
i
do
not
ask
him
about
the
date
of
his
purchase
or
the
extent
of
his
holding
shortly
before
i
left
for
asia
on
march
i
learn
that
dave
first
purchase
share
of
lubrizol
on
december
which
he
then
sell
on
december
subsequently
on
january
and
he
bought
share
pursuant
to
a
share
order
he
have
place
with
a
per
share
limit
price
dave
s
purchase
be
make
before
he
have
discuss
lubrizol
with
me
and
with
no
knowledge
of
how
i
might
react
to
his
idea
in
addition
of
course
he
do
not
know
what
lubrizol
s
reaction
would
be
if
i
developed
an
interest
furthermore
he
knew
he
would
have
no
voice
in
berkshire
s
decision
once
he
suggest
the
idea
it
would
be
up
to
me
and
charlie
munger
subject
to
ratification
by
the
berkshire
board
of
which
dave
be
not
a
member
as
late
as
january
i
sent
dave
a
short
note
indicate
my
skepticism
about
make
an
offer
for
lubrizol
and
my
preference
for
another
substantial
acquisition
for
which
midamerican
have
make
a
bid
only
after
dave
report
on
the
january
dinner
conversation
with
james
hambrick
do
i
get
interested
in
the
acquisition
of
lubrizol
neither
dave
nor
i
feel
his
lubrizol
purchase
be
in
any
way
unlawful
he
have
told
me
that
they
be
not
a
factor
in
his
decision
to
resign
dave
s
letter
be
a
total
surprise
to
me
despite
the
two
earlier
resignation
talk
i
have
spoken
with
him
the
previous
day
about
various
operating
matter
and
receive
no
hint
of
his
intention
to
resign
this
time
however
i
do
not
attempt
to
talk
him
out
of
his
decision
and
accepted
his
resignation
effective
with
dave
s
resignation

future
i

that

what
i

i

there

be
privately

just
have
an
enormous

if

everyone
want

begin
to

about
how

i
would
have
spent

another

during
the
ensue
four
decade
this
be
early
in
my
business
career
and
that
money
spent
on
maintenance
would
have
be
unavailable
to
invest
in

know
what
opportunity
i
might
have
miss

it
day
later
buffett
saw
quickly
that
the
business
have
a
huge
moat
around
it
because
of
its
service
which
get
of
frame
order
to
the
customer
the
next
day
buffett
have
since
say
he
have
never
thought
about
the
picture
frame
business
but
could
tell
almost
instantly
that
he
want
it
because
it
have
location
with
a
sale
force
that
call
on
all
client
six
time
a
year
also
attractive
to
buffett
be
the
fact
that
the
company
have
a
real
investment
in
a

force
distribution
and
low

sensitivity
that
would
be
hard
for
another

to
beat
buffett
say
it
would
make
no
sense
to
compete
with
it
the
investment
would
never
pay
off
even
if
you
do
have
hundred

it
would
be
impossible

perhaps
buffett
be
think
the
railroad
could
deliver
toy
train
for

to
come
the
elephant
investment
buffett
be
always
hop
to
make
be
finally
tracked
down
in
this
case
it
be
the
mother
of
all
elephant
demonstrate
characteristic
thought
and
act
with
extraordinary
speed

berkshire
would
buy
all

not
only
cash
and
berkshire
stock
for
the
share
buffett
didn
t
own
but
also
the
cost
of
the
share
he
already
own
and
a
far
billion
of
burlington
debt
which
berkshire
assume
since
buffett
have
patiently
accumulate
of
the
railroad
s
stock
building
the
wherewithal
to
fork
over
berkshire
stock
and
cash
to
pay
for
the
other
in
a
sluggish
economy
as
compare
with
other
wall
street
deal
he
negotiate
the
bnsf
deal
in
a
nanosecond
comment
on
the
purchase
in
a
half
hour
interview
buffett
told
cnbc
november
that
his
bet
on
the
country
come
together
quickly
after
he
have
suggest
it
day
before
to
burlington
s
ceo
matthew
rise
an
engineer
who
double
the
railroad
s
revenue
from
through
that
same
day
buffett
told
fox
business
network
that
the
deal
begin
when
he
told
rise
matt
if
you
re
ever
look
for
a
home
for
the
railroad
berkshire
would
be
a
good
one
buffett
later
say
he
felt
embolden
when
rise
didn
t
throw
him
out
of
their
meeting
buffett
told
cnbc
that
burlington
move
good
in
a
cost
effective
and
extraordinarily
environmentally
friendly
way
he
explain
bnsf
last
year
move
on
average
a
ton
of
good
mile
on
one
gallon
of
diesel
it
release
far
few
pollutant
into
the
atmosphere
it
save
enormously
on
energy
consumption
and
you
know
it
diminishes
highway
congestion
rail
last
year
move
more
than
of
the
ton
mile
in
the
country
they
move
more
than
all
those
truck
just
the
four
big
railroad
so
it
s
a
very
effective
way
of
move
good
and
i
just
basically
believe
this
country
you
know
will
prosper
and
you
ll
have
more
people
move
more
good
and
and
year
from
now
and
the
rail
should
benefit
it
s
a
bet
on
the
country
basically
buffett
say
in
a
statement
our
country
s
future
prosperity
depends
on
its
have
an
efficient
and
well
maintain
rail
system
berkshire
may
very
well
be
create
some
synergy
with
the

if
the
news
flash
of
the
buy
be
not
enough
buffett
do
the
unthinkable
he
announce
a
to
stock
split
for
the
b

bring
the

down
from
more

should
they
choose

over

berkshire
later
say
its

thought
the
split
be
advisable
whether
or
not
the
burlington

buffett

i

buffett
also
told

that
he
do
not

that

asset
for
berkshire
to
own
over
the

he
go

it

an
opportunity

prosper

of

september
found
a
different
wrinkle
but
agree
that
the
purchase
have
succession
in
mind
a
quirk
in
the
rule
for
railroad
allows
them
to
avoid
liquidation
in
the
event
of
bankruptcy
after
buffett

whoever
be
in

could
bumble

some

instrument
that
for
unforeseen
reason
blow
up
if
the
blow
up
be
large
enough
it
could
trigger
the
need
to

berkshire
hathaway
s
house
in
order
the
clause
in
the

act
would
protect

the

emerges
from

the
second
significant
succession
strategy
of
a
railroad
have
to
do
with
what
be
call
compulsory
merger
this
requirement
allows
the
icc
and
a
railroad
that
have
go
bankrupt
to
merge
with
another
company
on

drawn
up
by
the

the
bankrupt
company

the
acquire
company
since
the
railroad
industry
like
the
airline
industry
be
infamous
for
bankruptcy
berkshire
would
get
to
take
advantage

the

rule

just
around

he
will
deliver
the

the

will
pay

the

of

purchase
in

issue
already
outstanding
this
settlement
date
will
usually
be
about
a
week
after
confirmation
date
whereas
on
new
issue
the
settlement
date
may
be
as
much
as
a
month
later
the
settlement
date
be
show
plainly
on
the
confirmation
ticket
in
the
case
of

this
will
be
the
second

final

rather
than
the
preliminary

you
should

on
the

if
you
presently
own

they
can
be
sell
on
a
couple
of
day
notice
by
your

upon
your
instruction
so
you
should
experience
no

have
the

on

even
if
the

dealer
be

get
them
deliver
to
your

bond
will
be
deliver
in
negotiable
form
so
call
bearer
form
which
make
them
like
currency
with
coupon
attach
usually
the
bond
be
in
denomination
and
frequently
they
can
be
exchange
for
register
bond
sometimes
at
considerable
expense
and
sometimes
free
it
depends
upon
the
term
bond
in
register
form
be
nonnegotiable
without
assignment
by
you
since
you
be
the
register
owner
on
the
transfer
agent
s
book
bond
trade
almost
exclusively
on
a
bearer
basis
and
it
be
virtually
impossible
to
sell
register
bond
without
convert
them
back
into
bearer
form
thus
unless
you
be
go
to
own
great
physical
quantity
of
bond
i
recommend
keep
bond
in
bearer
form
this
mean
keep
them
in
a
very
safe
place
and
clip
the
coupon
every
six
month
such
coupon
when
clipped
can
be
deposit
in
your
bank
account
just
like
check
if
you
have
in
bond
this
probably
mean
about
fifty
separate
piece
of
paper
denomination
and
perhaps
six
or
eight
trip
a
year
to
the
safe
deposit
section
to
cut
and
deposit
coupon
it
be
also
possible
to
open
a
custody
account
with
a
bank
where
for
a
fairly
nominal
cost
they
will
keep
the
bond
collect
the
interest
and
preserve
your
record
for
you
for
example
a
bank
will
probably
perform
the
custodial
service
for
you
for
about
a
year
on
a
portfolio
if
you
be
interested
in
a
custodial
account
you
should
talk
to
a
trust
officer
at
your
commercial
bank
as
to
the
nature
of
their
service
and
cost
otherwise
you
should
have

box
taxation
the
interest
receive
upon
the
deposit
of
coupon
from
tax
free
bond
be
of
course
free
from
federal
income
tax
this
mean
if
you
be
at
a
top
federal
income
tax
bracket
a
return
from
tax
free
bond
be
equivalent
to
about
from
taxable
bond
thus
for
most
of
our
partner
exclude
minor
and
some
retire
people
tax
free
bond
will
be
more
attractive
than
taxable
bond
for
people
with
little
or
no
income
from
wage
or
dividend
but
with
substantial
capital
it
be
possible
that
a
combination
of
taxable
bond
to
bring
taxable
income
up
to
about
the
or
bracket
plus
tax
free
bond
will
bring
the
high
total
after
tax
income
where
appropriate
we
will
work
with
you
to
achieve
such
a
balance
the
situation
in
respect
to
state
income
tax
be
more
complicate
in
nebraska
where
the
state
income
tax
be
compute
as
a
percentage
of
the
federal
income
tax
the
effect
be
that
there
be
no
state
tax
on
interest
from
tax
free
bond
my
understand
of
both
the
new
york
and
california
law
be
that
tax
free
bond
of
entity
within
the
home
state
be
not
subject
to
state
income
tax
but
tax
free
bond
from
other
state
be
subject
to
the
local
state
income
tax
i
also
believe
that
the
new
york
city
income
tax
exempts
tax
free
bond
of
entity
base
within
the
state
of
new
york
but
tax
those
from
other
state
i
be
no
expert
on
state
income
tax
and
make
no
attempt
to
post
myself
on
change
take
place
within
the
various
state
or
city
therefore
i
defer
to
your
local
tax
advisor
but
simply
mention
these
few
general
impression
so
that
you
will
be
alert
to
the
existence
of
a
potential
problem
in
nebraska
there
be
no
need
to
have
any
local
consideration
enter
into
the
after
tax
calculation
where
out
of
state
issue
be
subject
to
local
taxation
the
effective
cost
of
your
state
or
municipal
income
tax
be
reduce
by
the
benefit
receive
from
deduct
it
on
your
federal
income
tax
return
this
of
course
varies
with
the
individual
additionally
in
some
state
there
be
various
tax
on
intangible
property
which
may
apply
to
all
tax
free
bond
or
just
those
of
out
of
state
entity
there
be
none
of
these
in
nebraska
but
i
cannot
advise
on
the
other
state
when
bond
be
bought
at
a
discount
from
par
and
later
be
sell
or
mature
come
due
and
get
paid
the
difference
between
the
proceeds
and
cost
be
subject
to
capital
gain
or
loss
treatment
there
be
minor
exception
to
this
statement
as
unfortunately
there
be
to
most
general
statement
on
investment
and
tax
but
they
will
be
point
out
to
you
should
they
affect
any
security
we
recommend
this
reduces
the
net
after
tax
yield
by
a
factor
involve
the
general
rate
of
future
capital
gain
tax
and
the
specific
future
tax
position
of
the
individual
later
on
we
will
discus
the
impact
of
such
capital
gain
tax
in
calculate
the
relative
attractiveness
of
discount
bond
versus
full
coupon
bond
finally
one
most
important
point
although
the
law
be
not
completely
clear
you
should
probably
not
contemplate
own
tax
free
bond
if
you
have
or
expect
to
have
general
purpose
bank
or
other
indebtedness
the
law
excludes
the
deductibility
of
interest
on
loan
incur
or
continued
to
purchase
or
carry
tax
free
bond
and
the
interpretation
of
this
statute
will
probably
tend
to
be
broaden
as
the
year
pas
for
example
my
impression
be
that
you
have
no
problem
if
you
have
a
mortgage
against
real
property
unless
the
debt
be
incur
in
order
to
acquire
municipal
bond
in
deduct
the
mortgage
interest
on
your
federal
tax
return
even
though
you
own
tax
free
bond
at
the
same
time
however
i
believe
that
if
you
have
a
general
bank
loan
even
though
the
proceeds
be
directly
use
to
purchase
stock
a
handball
court
etc
and
the
tax
free
bond
be
not
use
for
security
for
the
loan
you
be
ask
for
trouble
if
you
deduct
the
interest
and
at
the
same
time
be
the
owner
of
tax
free
bond
therefore
i
would
pay
off
bank
loan
before
own
tax
free
bond
but
i
leave
detailed
examination
of
this
question
to
you
and
your
tax
advisor
i
merely
mention
it
to
make
you
aware
of
the
potential
problem
marketability
tax
free
bond
be
materially
different
from
common
stock
or
corporate
bond
in
that
there
be
literally
hundred
of
thousand
of
issue
with
the
great
majority
have
very
few
holder
this
substantially
inhibits
the
development
of
close
active
market
whenever
the
city
of
new
york
or
philadelphia
want
to
raise
money
it
sell
perhaps
twenty
thirty
or
forty
nonidentical
security
since
it
will
offer
an
issue
with
that
many
different
maturity
a
of
new
york
come
due
in
be
a
different
animal
from
a
bond
of
new
york
come
due
in
one
cannot
be
exchange
for
the
other
and
a
seller
have
to
find
a
buyer
for
the
specific
item
he
hold
when
you
consider
that
new
york
may
offer
bond
several
time
a
year
it
be
easy
to
see
why
just
this
one
city
may
have
somewhere
in
the
neighborhood
of
issue
outstanding
grand
island
nebraska
may
have
issue
outstanding
the
average
amount
of
each
issue
might
be
and
the
average
number
of
holder
may
be
six
or
eight
per
issue
thus
it
be
absolutely
impossible
to
have
quote
market
at
all
time
for
all
issue
and
spread
between
bid
and
offer
may
be
very
wide
you
can
t
set
forth
in
the
morning
to
buy
a
specific
grand
island
issue
of
your
choose
it
may
not
be
offer
at
any
price
anywhere
and
if
you
do
find
one
seller
there
be
no
reason
why
he
have
to
be
realistic
compare
to
other
offering
of
similar
quality
on
the
other
hand
there
be
single
issue
such
as
those
of
the
ohio
turnpike
illinois
turnpike
etc
that
amount
to
million
or
more
and
have
thousand
of
bondholder
own
a
single
entirely
homogeneous
and
interchangeable
issue
obviously
here
you
get
a
high
degree
of
marketability
marketability
be
generally
a
function
of
the
follow
three
item
in
descend
order
of
importance
the
size
of
the
particular
issue
the
size
of
the
issuer
a
issue
of
the
state
of
ohio
will
be
more
marketable
than
a
issue
of
podunk
ohio
and
the
quality
of
the
issuer
by
far
the
most
sale
effort
go
into
the
sell
of
new
issue
of
bond
an
average
of
over
million
per
week
of
new
issue
come
up
for
sale
and
the
machinery
of
bond
distribution
be
gear
to
get
them
sell
large
or
small
in
my
opinion
there
be
frequently
insufficient
differential
in
yield
at
time
of
issue
for
the
marketability
difference
that
will
exist
once
the
initial
sale
push
be
terminate
we
have
frequently
run
into
market
in
bond
where
the
spread
between
bid
and
ask
price
may
get
to
there
be
no
need
to
buy
bond
with
the
potential
for
such
grotesque
market
although
the
profit
spread
to
the
dealer
who
originally
offer
them
be
frequently
wider
than
on
more
marketable
bond
and
we
will
not
be
buying
them
for
you
the
bond
we
expect
to
buy
will
usually
tend
to
have
spread
reflect
the
difference
between
what
you
would
pay
net
for
such
bond
on
purchase
and
receive
net
on
sale
at
the
same
point
in
time
of
from
to
such
a
spread
would
be
devastate
if
you
attempt
to
trade
in
such
bond
but
i
don
t
believe
it
should
be
a
deterrent
for
a
long
term
investor
the
real
necessity
be
to
stay
away
from
bond
of
very
limited
marketability
which
frequently
be
the
type
local
bond
dealer
have
the
great
monetary
incentive
to
push
specific
area
of
purchase
we
will
probably
concentrate
our
purchase
in
the
follow
general
area
large

produce
public

such
as
toll
road
electric

etc
many
of
these
issue
posse
high
marketability
be
subject
to
quantitative
analysis
and
sometimes
have
favorable
sinking
fund
or
other
factor
which
tend
not
to
receive
full
valuation
in
the
marketplace

arise
when
a

only

less
because
of
change
in
the
tax
law
for
a
period
of

there
be
a
very
substantial
prejudice
against

considerably
high

this

still

our

and
i
can
t
fill
your
need
from
and
my
tendency
would
be
to
put
you
into
housing
authority
issue
rather
than
try
to
select
from
among
credit
that
i
don
t
understand
if
you
direct
me
to
buy
obligation
of
your
home
state
you
should
expect
substantial
quantity
of
housing
authority
issue
there
be
no
need
to
diversify
among
such
issue
as
they
all
represent
the
top
credit
available
state
obligation
of
a
direct
or
indirect
nature
you
will
notice
i
be
not
buying
issue
of
large
city
i
don
t
have
the
faintest
idea
how
to
analyze
a
new
york
city
chicago
philadelphia
etc
a
friend
mention
the
other
day
when
newark
be
try
to
sell
bond
at
a
very
fancy
rate
that
the
mafia
be
get
very
upset
because
newark
be
give
them
a
bad
name
your
analysis
of
a
new
york
city
and
i
admit
it
be
hard
to
imagine
them
not
pay
their
bill
for
any
extend
period
of
time
would
be
as
good
as
mine
my
approach
to
bond
be
pretty
much
like
my
approach
to
stock
if
i
can
t
understand
something
i
tend
to
forget
it
passing
an
opportunity
which
i
don
t
understand
even
if
someone
else
be
perceptive
enough
to
analyze
it
and
get
paid
well
for
do
it
doesn
t
bother
me
we
will
probably
tend
to
purchase
somewhere
between
five
and
ten
issue
for
most
of
you
we
will
try
not
to
buy
in
small
than
piece
and
will
prefer
large
amount
where
appropriate
small
lot
of
bond
be
usually
penalize
upon
resale
sometimes
substantially
the
bond
salesman
doesn
t
usually
explain
this
to
you
when
you
buy
the
of
bond
from
him
but
it
get
explain
when
you
later
try
to
sell
the
to
him
we
may
make
exception
where
we
be
buying
secondary
market
issue
in
small
piece
but
only
if
we
be
get
an
especially
good
price
on
the
buy
side
because
of
the
small
size
of
the
offering
callable
bond
we
will
not
buy
bond
where
the
issuer
of
the
bond
have
a
right
to
call
retire
the
bond
on
a
basis
which
substantially
load
the
contract
in
his
favor
it
be
amaze
to
me
to
see
people
buy
bond
which
be
due
in
forty
year
but
where
the
issuer
have
the
right
to
call
the
bond
at
a
tiny
premium
in
five
or
ten
year
such
a
contract
essentially
mean
that
you
have
make
a
forty
year
deal
if
it
be
advantageous
to
the
issuer
and
disadvantageous
to
you
and
a
five
year
deal
if
the
initial
contract
turn
out
to
be
advantageous
to
you
and
disadvantageous
to
the
issuer
such
contract
be
really
outrageous
and
exist
because
bond
investor
can
t
think
through
the
implication
of
such
a
contract
form
and
bond
dealer
don
t
insist
on
well
term
for
their
customer
one
extremely
interest
fact
be
that
bond
with
very
unattractive
call
feature
sell
at
virtually
the
same
yield
as
otherwise
identical
bond
which
be
noncallable
it
should
be
point
out
that
most
nebraska
bond
carry
highly
unfair
call
provision
despite
this
severe
contractual
disadvantage
they
do
not
offer
high
yield
than
bond
with
more
equitable
term
one
way
to
avoid
this
problem
be
to
buy
bond
which
be
totally
noncallable
another
way
be
to
buy
discount
bond
where
the
right
of
the
issuer
to
call
the
bond
be
at
a
price
so
far
above
your
cost
as
to
render
the
possible
call
inconsequential
if
you
buy
a
bond
at
which
be
callable
at
the
effective
cost
to
you
of
grant
the
issuer
the
right
to
prematurely
terminate
the
contract
which
be
a
right
you
never
have
be
insignificant
but
to
buy
a
bond
of
the
los
angeles
department
of
water
and
power
at
to
come
due
at
in
or
to
come
due
at
in
depend
on
which
be
to
the
advantage
of
the
issuer
and
to
your
disadvantage
be
the
height
of
foolishness
when
comparable
yield
be
available
on
similar
credit
without
such
an
unfair
contract
nevertheless
just
such
a
bond
be
issue
in
october
and
similar
bond
continue
to
be
issue
every
day
i
only
write
at
such
length
about
an
obvious
point
since
it
be
apparent
from
the
continual
sale
of
such
bond
that
many
investor
haven
t
the
faintest
notion
how
this
load
the
dice
against
them
and
many
bond
salesman
aren
t
about
to
tell
them
maturity
and
the
mathematics
of
bond
many
people
in
buying
bond
select
maturity
base
on
how
long
they
think
they
be
go
to
want
to
hold
bond
how
long
they
be
go
to
live
etc
while
this
be
not
a
silly
approach
it
be
not
necessarily
the
most
logical
the
primary
determinant
in
selection
of
maturity
should
probably
be
the
shape
of
the
yield
curve
your
expectation
regard
future
level
of
interest
rate
and
the
degree
of
quotational
fluctuation
you
be
willing
to
endure
or
hope
to
possibly
profit
from
of
course
be
the
most
important
but
by
far
the
most
difficult
upon
which
to
comment
intelligently
let
s
tackle
the
yield
curve
first
when
other
aspect
of
quality
be
identical
there
will
be
a
difference
in
interest
rate
paid
base
upon
the
length
of
the
bond
be
offer
for
example
a
top
grade
bond
be
offer
now
might
have
a
yield
of
if
it
come
due
in
six
or
nine
month
in
two
year
in
five
year
in
ten
year
and
in
twenty
year
when
long
rate
be
substantially
high
than
short
rate
the
curve
be
say
to
be
strongly
positive
in
the
u
s
government
bond
market
rate
recently
have
tend
to
produce
a
negative
yield
curve
that
be
a
long
term
government
bond
over
the
last
year
or
so
have
consistently
yield
less
than
a
short
term
one
sometimes
the
yield
curve
have
be
very
flat
and
sometimes
it
be
positive
out
to
a
give
point
such
as
ten
year
and
then
flattens
out
what
you
should
understand
be
that
it
varies
often
very
substantially
and
that
on
an
historical
basis
the
present
slope
tends
to
be
in
the
high
positive
range
this
doesn
t
mean
that
long
bond
be
go
to
be
worth
more
but
it
do
mean
that
you
be
be
paid
more
to
extend
maturity
than
in
many
period
if
yield
remain
constant
for
several
year
you
would
do
well
with
longer
bond
than
shorter
bond
regardless
of
how
long
you
intend
to
hold
them
the
second
factor
in
determine
maturity
selection
be
expectation
regard
future
rate
level
anyone
who
have
do
much
predict
in
this
field
have
tend
to
look
very
foolish
very
fast
i
do
not
regard
rate
as
unattractive
one
year
ago
and
i
be
prove
very
wrong
almost
immediately
i
believe
present
rate
be
not
unattractive
and
i
may
look
foolish
again
nevertheless
a
decision
have
to
be
make
and
you
can
make
just
as
great
a
mistake
if
you
buy
short
term
security
now
and
rate
available
on
reinvestment
in
a
few
year
be
much
low
the
final
factor
involves
your
tolerance
for
quotational
fluctuation
this
involves
the
mathematics
of
bond
investment
and
may
be
a
little
difficult
for
you
to
understand
nevertheless
it
be
important
that
you
get
a
general
grasp
of
the
principle
let
s
assume
for
the
moment
a
perfectly
flat
yield
curve
and
a
noncallable
bond
far
assume
present
rate
be
and
that
you
buy
two
bond
one
due
in
two
year
and
one
due
in
twenty
year
now
assume
one
year
later
that
yield
on
new
issue
have
go
to
and
that
you
wish
to
sell
your
bond
forget
about
market
spread
commission
etc
you
will
receive
for
the
original
two
year
bond
now
with
one
year
to
run
and
for
the
nineteen
year
bond
originally
twenty
year
at
these
price
a
purchaser
will
get
exactly
on
his
money
after
amortize
the
premium
he
have
paid
and
cash
the
stream
of
coupon
attach
to
each
bond
it
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
him
whether
to
buy
your
nineteen
year
bond
at
or
a
new
bond
which
we
have
assume
be
the
rate
current
one
year
later
at
on
the
other
hand
let
s
assume
rate
go
to
again
we
will
ignore
commission
capital
gain
tax
on
the
discount
etc
now
the
buyer
will
only
pay
for
the
bond
with
one
year
remain
until
maturity
and
for
the
bond
with
nineteen
year
left
since
he
can
get
on
new
issue
he
be
only
willing
to
buy
your
bond
at
a
discount
sufficient
so
that
accrual
of
this
discount
will
give
him
the
same
economic
benefit
from
your
coupon
that
a
coupon
at
would
give
him
the
principle
be
simple
the
wider
the
swing
in
interest
rate
and
the
longer
the
bond
the
more
the
value
of
a
bond
can
go
up
or
down
on
an
interim
basis
before
maturity
it
should
be
point
out
in
the
first
example
where
rate
go
to
our
long
term
bond
would
only
have
appreciate
to
about
if
it
have
be
callable
in
five
year
at
par
although
it
would
have
go
down
just
as
much
if
rate
have
occur
this
just
illustrates
the
inherent
unfairness
of
call
provision
for
over
two
decade
interest
rate
on
tax
free
bond
have
continuously
go
high
and
buyer
of
long
term
bond
have
continuously
suffer
this
do
not
mean
it
be
bad
now
to
buy
long
term
bond
it
simply
mean
that
the
illustration
in
the
above
paragraph
have
work
in
only
one
direction
for
a
long
period
of
time
and
people
be
much
more
conscious
of
the
downside
risk
from
high
rate
than
the
upside
potential
from
low
one
if
it
be
a
fifty
fifty
chance
as
to
the
future
general
level
of
interest
rate
and
the
yield
curve
be
substantially
positive
then
the
odds
be
well
in
buying
long
term
noncallable
bond
than
shorter
term
one
this
reflect
my
current
conclusion
and
therefore
i
intend
to
buy
bond
within
the
ten
to
twenty
five
year
range
if
you
decide
to
buy
a
twenty
year
bond
and
hold
the
bond
straight
through
you
be
go
to
get
the
concentrate
rate
of
interest
but
if
you
sell
earlier
you
be
go
to
be
subject
to
the
mathematical
force
i
have
described
for
well
or
for
bad
bond
price
also
change
because
of
change
in
quality
over
the
year
but
in
the
tax
free
area
this
have
tend
to
be
and
probably
will
continue
to
be
a
relatively
minor
factor
compare
to
the
impact
of
change
in
the
general
structure
of
interest
rate
discount
versus
full
coupon
bond
you
will
have
notice
in
the
above
discussion
that
if
you
now
want
to
buy
a
return
on
a
nineteen
year
bond
you
d
have
a
choice
between
buying
a
new
nineteen
year
bond
with
a
coupon
rate
or
buying
a
bond
with
a
coupon
at
which
would
pay
you
in
nineteen
year
either
purchase
would
have
yield
exactly
compound
semiannually
to
you
mathematically
they
be
the
same
in
the
case
of
tax
free
bond
the
equation
be
complicate
however
by
the
fact
that
the
coupon
be
entirely
tax
free
to
you
whereas
the
bond
purchase
at
a
discount
give
you
tax
free
income
of
per
year
but
a
capital
gain
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
year
of
under
the
present
tax
law
you
would
owe
anything
from
a
nominal
tax
if
the
gain
from
realization
of
the
discount
be
your
only
taxable
income
in
the
nineteenth
year
up
to
a
tax
of
over
if
it
come
on
top
of
very
large
amount
of
capital
gain
at
that
time
the
new
tax
law
provide
for
capital
gain
rate
of
and
even
slightly
high
on
an
indirect
basis
in
and
thereafter
for
those
realize
very
large
gain
in
addition
to
this
you
might
have
some
state
tax
to
pay
on
the
capital
gain
obviously
under
these
circumstance
you
be
not
go
to
pay
the
for
the
coupon
and
feel
you
be
equally
as
well
off
as
with
the
coupon
at
neither
be
anyone
else
therefore
identical
quality
security
with
identical
maturity
sell
at
considerably
high
gross
yield
when
they
have
low
coupon

interestingly
enough
for

taxpayer
such
high
gross

over
compensate
for
the
probable
tax
to

this
be
due
to
several
factor
first
no
one
know
what
the
tax
law
will
be
when
the
bond
mature
and
it
be
both
natural
and
probably
correct
to
assume
the
tax
rate
will
be
stiffer
at
that
time
than
now
second
even
though
a
coupon
on
a
bond
purchase
at
due
in
nineteen
year
be
the
equivalent
of
a
coupon
on
a
bond
purchase
at
par
with
the
same
maturity
people
prefer
to
get
the
high
current
return
in
their
pocket
the
owner
of
the
coupon
bond
be
only
get
around
current
yield
on
his
with
the
balance
necessary
to
get
him
up
to
come
from
the
extra
he
pick
up
at
the
end
finally
the
most
important
factor
affect
price

and
which
will
keep
affect

anything
that

from
one
segment
of

have
dramatic
effect
on
the

in

segment
this
may
tend
to
give
some
edge

particularly
those
who

some
with

some
with

which

on
the

the

we
be
able
to
make
sensible
investment
in
a
few
junk
bond
and

overall
our
commitment
in
this
sector
sextupled
reach
billion
by
year
end
invest
in
junk
bond
and
invest
in
stock
be
alike
in
certain
way
both
activity
require
us
to
make
a
price
value
calculation
and
also
to
scan
hundred
of
security
to
find
the
very
few
that
have
attractive
reward
risk
ratio
but
there
be
important
difference
between
the
two
discipline
as
well
in
stock
we
expect
every
commitment
to
work
out
well
because
we
concentrate
on
conservatively
finance
business
with
strong
competitive
strength
run
by
able
and
honest
people
if
we
buy
into
these
company
at
sensible
price
loss
should
be
rare
indeed
during
the
year
we
have
run
the
company
s
affair
gain
from
the
equity
we
manage
at
berkshire
that
be
exclude
those
manage
at
general
re
cologne
and
geico
have
exceed
loss
by
a
ratio
of
about
to
one
purchasing
junk
bond
we
be
deal
with
enterprise
that
be
far
more
marginal
these
business
be
usually
overload
with
debt
and
often
operate
in
industry
characterize
by
low
return
on
capital
additionally
the
quality
of
management
be
sometimes
questionable
management
may
even
have
interest
that
be
directly
counter
to
those
of
debtholders
therefore
we
expect
that
we
will
have
occasional
large
loss
in
junk
issue
so
far
however
we
have
do
reasonably
well
in
this
field
at
the
end
of
berkshire
held
about
billion
worth
of
junk
bond
in
the
energy
business
and
about
billion
worth
in
the
telecommunication

rang
up
a
huge
gain
by
invest
about
billion
in

in
late
some
have
guess
that
within

so
he
have

in

become
very
cheap
and
we
purchase
about
billion
of
these
the
pendulum
swung
very
quickly

and
this

now
look

about
berkshire
s
activity
that
appear
in
the

issue
of
the
wall
street
journal
a
generally
excellent
paper
that
i
have
for
all
of
my
life
found
useful
on
the
front
page
and
above
the
fold
as
they
say
the
journal
publish
a
news
brief
that
say
in
unequivocal
term
that
we
be
buying
bond
of
conseco
and
finova
this
item
direct
the
reader
to
the
lead
story
of
the
money
and
invest
section
there
in
the
second
paragraph
of
the
story
the
journal
report
again
without
any
qualification
that
berkshire
be
buying
conseco
and
finova
bond
add
that
berkshire
have
invest
several
hundred
million
dollar
in
each
only
in
the
th
paragraph
of
the
story
which
by
that
point
have
jumped
to
an
inside
page
do
the
paper
hedge
a
bit
say
that
our
conseco
purchase
have
be
disclose
by
people
familiar
with
the
matter
well
not
that
familiar
true
we
have
purchase
bond
and
bank
debt
of
finova
though
the
report
be
wildly
inaccurate
as
to
the
amount
but
to
this
day
neither
berkshire
nor
i
have
ever
bought
a
share
of
stock
or
a
bond
of
conseco
at
wesco
s
annual
meeting
in
munger
give
some
detail
about
how
berkshire
buy
bond
berkshire
hold
bond
in
two
way
in
one
way
we
hold
bond
in
the
insurance
company
portfolio
because
we
can
t
find
stock
attractive
enough
and
therefore
our
default
option
be
bond
by
and
large
our
default
option
have
be
mortgage
back
bond
in
the
last
year
or
so
so
most
of
the
bond
be
in
that
category
we
also
buy
u
s
government
bond
we
even
buy
a
few
junk
bond
from
time
to
time
that
s
one
way
of
invest
money
when
we
can
t
find
stock
that
we
like
the
other
way
of
invest
in
bond
be
in
our
finance
subsidiary
at
berkshire
as
part
of
what
i
call
miscellaneous
warren
buffett
financial
activity
i
don
t
think
there
s
a
name
for
that
in
accounting
but
that
s
what
it
be
as
long
as
warren
s
do
it
i
love
to
see
it
do
and
we
ve
make
a
few
hundred
million
pre
tax
dollar
do
that
over
the
year
without
much
risk
or
fuss
so
we
have
that
extra
category
munger
add
in
a
stun
move
at
the
height
of
the

market

berkshire

the
timing
be
right
and
the

a

might
have

some

the
point

the
mess
at

gutfreund
told
a
colleague
that
reading
the
wall
street
journal
story
about
top
salomon
official
know
about
illegal
bidding
be
like
reading
his
obituary
institutional
investor

he
call
buffett
and
say
that
he
and

and
volunteer
to

interim
basis
in
the
same
interview
buffett
say
you
won
t
believe
this
because
i
don
t
look
that
dumb
but
i
volunteer
for
the
job
of
interim
chairman
it
s
not
what
i
want
to
be
do
but
it
will
be
what
i
will
be
do
until
it
get

properly
in
a
talk
to

buffett
say
salomon
owe
more
money
than
any
other
institution
in
the
united
state
with
the
exception
of
citicorp
the
big
bank
salomon
s
total
liability
be
just
under
billion
now
billion

roughly
equal
to
the
profit
of
all
of
the
company
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
that
year
the
problem
about
this
billion
be
that
basically
it
almost
all
come
due
within
the
next
couple
of
week
so
we
be
face
with
the
fact
all
over
the
world
because
the
money
be
owe
all
over
the
world
that
people
on
that
friday
and
the
follow
monday
be
go
to
want
us
to
pay
back
odd
billion
or
something
close
to
it
which
be
not
the
easy
thing
to
do
buffett
face
the
complex
issue
of
appease
investor
and
client
deal
with
criminal
and
civil
investigator
and
worry
about
some
new
bomb
explode
on
his
watch
but
buffett
be
the
logical
person
to
turn
to
and
he
get
thing
off
on
the
right
foot
when
he
quickly
met
with
salomon
s
manage
director
at
the
world
trade
center
tell
them
that
the
firm
s
reputation
for
stay

would
not
be
acceptable
the
new

august
he
told
them
he
would
be
open
and
that
the
firm
face
a
huge
management
job
in
deal
with
fine
and

still
frequently
have
its
snakebit
day
on
march
a
clerk
mistook
a
customer
s
order
to
sell
million
of
stock
as
an
order
to
unload
million
share
some
million

minute
of
the

wipe
out
a

which
close
instead
with
a
one
point
loss
the
clerk
be
not
fire
buffett
say
it
be
an
honest
mistake
in
fact
buffett
ask
that
he
not
be
told
the
clerk
s
name
at
the
three
hour
salomon
annual
meeting
in
may
corporate
gadfly
evelyn
y
davis
ask
buffett
how
he
could
justify
charge
salomon
for
his
corporate
jet
flight
from
omaha
to
new
york
during
the
crisis
buffett
reply
that
he
be
work
for
a
year
for
salomon
i
work
cheap
but
i
travel
expensive
he
say
when
she
ask
him
whether
the
company
s
million
in
legal
fee
to
deal
with
the
scandal
be
too
much
buffett
deadpanned
i
would
be
delighted
to
have
you
negotiate
with
them
evelyn
and
i
think
the
mere
mention
of
that
would
be
enough
to
induce
a
little
moderation
on
may
salomon
reach
a
million
settlement
with
the
government
salomon
agree
to
pay
million
in
fine
and
forfeiture
relate
to
the
cheat
in
the
treasury
auction
in
additon
a
million
fund
be
establish
by
salomon
to
compensate
victim
who
lose
money
as
a
result
of
the
wrongdoing
as
part
of
the
settlement
salomon
be
suspend
from
trading
with
the
federal
reserve
for
a
two
month
period
end
august
at
that
time
the
treasury
department
say
sanction
impose
on
salomon
would
be
lift
allow
the
firm
to
resume
submit
bid
for
customer
the
settlement
be
one
of
the
large
ever
for
wrongdoing
in
the
security
industry
but
the
good
news
for
salomon
be
that
it
escape
criminal
charge
we
believe
buffett
say
that
the
intense
regulatory
and
investigative
focus
on
salomon
have
end
we
can
now
move
forward
to
show
that
high
ethical
standard
and
meaningful
profit
be
not
only
compatible
objective
but
one
that
can
reinforce
each
other
i
believe
salomon
would
have
go
under
without
warren
buffett
say
steve
forbes
head
of
the
forbes

there
be
no
question
he
save
it
that
view
be
support
by
someone
else

overhaul
the

chairman
of
the
parent
firm
salomon
inc
but
buffett
s
sole
recommendation
for
the
job
be
robert
denham
who
have
serve
buffett
so
well
during
the
salomon
crisis
at

buffett
s
pay
say
that
on
a
prorate
basis
buffett
be
due
cent
but
buffett
merit
a
dollar
anyway
give
pay
for
performance
and
in
light
of
our
belief
in
pay
for
performance
i
think
we
should
award
him
the
whole
dollar
denham
say
buffett
reply
bob
may
look
at
this
as
pay
for
performance
but
i
look
at
it
as
interest
for
late
payment
twenty
one
cent
for
four
month
be
interest
which
be
a
rate
i
extend
only
to
my
best
credit

chief
financial

don
howard
say
don
t
think
you
don
t
have
to
pay

on
it
just
because
it
s

institutional

must
get

before
buying
more
than
of
a
company
for
investment
purpose
two
year
to
the
day
after
the
salomon
scandal
broke
berkshire
announce
it
plan
to
raise
its
stake
in
salomon
the
plan
be
to
boost
it
to
up
from
the
it
held
by
way
of
the
prefer

investment
berkshire
also
announce
it
be
seek
clearance
from
federal

to
allow
it
to
buy
up
to

permission
be
grant
buffett
later
lift
his
salomon
s
stake
to
slightly
above
thus
give
him
a
tax
break
on
his
salomon
prefer
investment
but
salomon
stock
spent
a
lot
of
decline
the
move
be
not
my
most
brilliant
investment
to
date
buffett
say
forbes
december
in
word
come
that
buffett
would
not
convert
his
prefer
stock
into
common
stock
instead
he
take
million
in
cash
and
say
i
be
make
a
single
decision
about
whether
i
want
to
put
million
into
salomon
common
stock
at
today
or
whether
there
be
something
else
i
would
rather
have
berkshire
do
with
the
money
every
day
the
stock
market
offer
berkshire
an
option
to
buy
share
of
coca
cola
gillette
salomon
or
thousand
of
other
company
so
far
this
year
berkshire
have
not
exercise
this
market
option
to
buy
share
of
any
of
the
three
mention
company
include
salomon
when
it
be
trading
below
obviously
the
fact
that
berkshire
have
not
exercise
its
market
option
to
buy
more
coca
cola
or
gillette
do
not
mean
that
i
be
negative
on
these
company
nor
should
that
interpretation
be
place
upon
the
non
exercise
of
a
company
option
to
purchase
more
salomon
common
share
in
berkshire
convert
its
slice
of
the
prefer
stock
into
salomon
common
stock
still
buffett
left
his
option
open
by
say
that
at
some
future
time
he
might
sell
some
salomon
common
stock
in
late
berkshire
issue
million
of
year
exchangeable
note
berkshire
note
exchangeable
into
salomon
common
stock
it
be
a
way
to
get
cash
up
front
for
a
portion
of
his
investment
in
salomon
berkshire
plan
to
issue
million
of
note
but
investor
demand
push
it
up
to
million
the
note
amount
to
an
insurance
policy
on
buffett
s
decision
to
commit
to
salomon
s
common
share
they
would
let
him
bail
out
of
some
of
his
salomon
stock
in
three
year
and
have
cash
instead
it
must
come
sometimes
to
jam
today
as
alice
in
wonderland
famously
say
buffett
say
at
berkshire
s
annual
meeting
in
it
s
a
way
of
take
the
capital
out
of
that
block
of
stock
at
a
very
low
interest
cost
to
use
elsewhere
while
we
take
a
limited
position
of
the
upside
in
the
salomon
stock
we
just
decide
that
we
might
have
good
opportunity
at
some
point
to
use
the
money
and
we
thought
that
raise
the
money
at
a
current
cost
of
a
little
over
and
a
cost
to
maturity
of
and
we
think
the
actual
cost
be
likely
to
be
closer
to
make
sense
delegate
and
evaporate
buffett
s
ultimate
decision
about
his
salomon
stake
come
in
when
he
sell
it
to
traveler
and
swap
salomon
stock
for
traveler
stock
salomon

maughan

who
serve
together
on
the

talk
about
a
sale
of

the
talk
be
relayed
to
denham
and
on
to
buffett
who
give
his

be
my
thought
that
they
might

once
recall
a
story
about

be
the
kind
that
rich

against
that

in

after

of

offer
the
bet
it

thing
and
the

six
take
me
up
on
it

well
we
heaped
abuse
on
him
and
try
to
cajole
him
after
all
it
be
only
but
he
say
he
have
thought
it
over
and
decide
it
wasn
t
a
good
bet
for
him
he

if
you

the

the

be
not
always

buffett
have
shot
hole
through
the
efficient
market
theory
which
hold
that
every
stock
price
be
fairly
price
because
it
already
incorporates
all
know
information
about
a
company
the
theory
argues
that
nothing
be
to
be
gain
by
dig
for
new
information
accord
to
the
theory
since
market
price
at
any
give
moment
reflect
all
knowledge
the
price
in
the
stock
table
be
the
right
price
there
be
no
bargain
the
efficient
market
theory
say
it
s
useless
to
try
to
outperform
the
market
far
all
future
price
be
subject
to
new
random
information
at
berkshire
s
annual
meeting
in
buffett
summarize
his
problem
with
advocate
of
an
efficient
market
theory
observe
correctly
that
the
market
be
frequently
efficient
they
go
on
to
conclude
incorrectly
that
it
be
always
efficient
many
time
buffett
have
say
it
have
be
helpful
to
me
to
have
ten
of
thousand
turn
out
of
business
school
taught
that
it
didn
t
do
any
good
to
think
buffett
often
have
joked
that
he
wish
more
people
would
subscribe
to
the
efficient
market
theory
so
few
investor
would
be
try
to
figure
out
where
the
market
have
go
astray
where
it
do
not
reflect
intrinsic
value
it
be
in
this
murky
arena
that
buffett
thrives
do
his
lab
work
and
capitalize
on
fear
and
uncertainty
while
other
investor
be
panicked
into
sell
that
s
how
buffett
become
the
second
richest
person
in
the
world
he
think
the
efficient
market
theory
be
absurd
that
it
s
well
to
turn
it
on
its
head
believe
that
the
market
can
be
inefficient
subject
to
fear
greed
fad
and
herd
behavior
in
short
subject
to
temporary
insanity
buffett
do
not
maintain
the
market
be
always
wrong
indeed
it
be
often
correct
he
say
the
trick
be
figure
out
when
on
occasion
it
s
wildly
off
base
the
man
be
a
living
refutation
of
the
random
walk
theory
say
newsday
s
allan
sloan
buffett
write
an
article
for
barron
s
february
outline
the
investment
result
of
a
number
of
value
investor
who
have
consistently
beaten
the
market
what
one
have
to
wonder
about
the
efficient
market
theory
be
how
anything
can
be
efficient
when
fear
and
greed
infect
wall
street
it
be
not
a
mathematical
refutation
of
the
theory
the
only
sure
way
to
refute
be
to
just
present
the
record
of
buffett
who
have
consistently
beaten
the
market
over
a
lifetime
also
consider
that
the
market
drop
on
october
that
be
the
day
they
be
throw
rock
at
the
stock
market
but
do
the
underlie
economic
world
change
that
day
buffett
say
when
the
price
of
a
stock
can
be
influence
by
a
herd
on
wall
street
with
price
set
at
the
margin
by
the
most
emotional
person
or
the
greediest
person
or
the
most
depressed
person
it
be
hard
to
argue
that
the
market
always
price
rationally
in
fact
market
price
be
frequently
nonsensical
the
superinvestors
of
graham
and
doddsville
hermes
fall
buffett
have
also
say
i
d
be
a
bum
on
the
street
with
a
tin
cup
if
the
market
be
always
efficient
though
the
theory
carry
enormous
weight
in
academia
former

summer
told
the

roger

when
genius
fail
p
price
v

early
on
buffett
s
common
sense
lead
him
to
the
simple
premise
that
there
be
a
difference
between
price
and
value

what
you
pay
value
be
what
you
get
ben
graham
taught
buffett
that
concept
price
do
not
imply
that
you
get
a
thing
equal
in
value
to
what
you
paid

zero
in

just
have
more
of

do
morgan
recall
a
story
told
by
joe
garagiola
yogi
berra
once
told
his
friend
whitey
ford
that
he
have
just
purchase
a
valuable
house
ford
reply
that
he
be
familiar
with
the
house
and
didn
t
think
it
be
very
valuable
yogi
respond
with
you
may
not
think
it
s
valuable
now
but
you
will
after
i
tell
you
the
price
in
contrast
buffett
seek
to
buy
a
valuable
house
for
a
bargain
price
people
who
have
trade
with
buffett
describe
him
as
very
tough
on
pricing
you
know
people
who
want
to
argue
about
a
nd
on
a
trade
well
he
ll
try
to
get
the
last
th
out
of
it
be
one
description
of
buffett
s
focus
on
price
buffett
do
not
however
like
to
haggle
when
buying
or
sell
company
he
have
one
price
then
it
s
take
it
or
leave
it
inflation
buffett
be
also
always
mindful
about
the
havoc
that
inflation
can
wreak
an
investment
that
can
t
beat
inflation
be
useless
only
gain
in
purchasing
power
count
buffett
say
if
you
forego
the
purchase
of
hamburger
and
place
those
dollar
in
the
bank
for
two
year
you
will
receive
interest
which
after
tax
will
buy
two
hamburger
then
at
the
end
of
the
two
year
you
will
receive
back
an
amount
equal
to
the
number
of
dollar
in
the
original
deposit
but
which
will
only
purchase
eight
hamburger
you
will
feel
richer
but
you
won
t
eat
richer
the
hamburger
parable
be
an
example
of
buffett
s
genius
you
do
not
have
to
read
a
textbook
or
an
economist
s
over
blown
explanation
of
inflation
it
s
all
there
simply
put
in
one
paragraph
buffett
at
the
berkshire
annual
meeting
in
say
this
about
valuation
i
always
crank
through
something
for
inflation
compound
something
else
buffett
understands
be
the
beauty
of
compound
buffett
ruminates
invest
at
for
year
grows
to
at
the
same
becomes
this
difference
strike
me
as
a
significant
difference
that
might
conceivably
arouse
one
s
curiosity
let
s
look
at
what
some
other
people
have
say
about
compound
albert
einstein
once
say
what
be
the
great
miracle
know
to
man
compound
bernard
baruch
say
compound
be
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
ben
franklin
once
write
of
compound
ti
the
stone
that
will
turn
all
your
lead
into
gold
remember
that
money
be
of
a
prolific
generate
nature
money
can
beget
money
and
its
offering
can
beget
more
as
sidney
homer
say
a
thousand
dollar
invest
at
just
for
year
grows
to
quadrillion
but
the
first
year
be
the
hardest
george
morgan
s
example
of
compound

have
long

there

in

master
pp
john
train
relates
the
follow
story
buffett
once
met
a
lead
executive
of
a
capital
intensive
business
giant
at
a
time
when
the
company
be
sell
in
the
market
for
one
quarter
of
its
replacement
value
buffett
ask
the
executive
why
don
t
you
buy
back
your
own
stock
if
you
like
to
build

at

why
not

we
should
buffett
well
executive
that
s
not
what
we
re
here
to

this
be

can
t
estragon
why
not
vladimir
we
re
wait

godot
it
be
through
rationality
that
buffett
sometimes
at
the
expense
of
less
rational
people
have
make
invest
his
art
form
he
be
bless
with
common
sense
even
genius
but
the
one
ingredient
that
override
it
all
be
a
love
of
what
he
be
do
buffett
love
the
invest
process
in
the
same
way
an
artist
love
his
creation
say
omaha
stockbroker
george
morgan
buffett
be
intensely
passionate
about
what
he
do
one
question
on
his
pretend
job
application
other
than

s
your

love

stir
well

the
result
can
be

kiss
keep
it
simple
stupid
be
another
buffett
tenet
his
passion
be
for
analysis
and
problem
solve
his
aim
be
to
simplify
no
stock
split
buffett
feel
it
make
no
sense
to
pay
dividend
automatically
or
do
stock
split
though
berkshire
do
have
a
backdoor
split
with
the
issuance
of
an
additional
new
class
of
stock
in
see
a
do
it
yourself
stock
split
chapter
buffett
have
say
splitting
make
no
sense
because
transactional
cost
be
great
and
it
draw
more
speculation
to
berkshire
besides
he
say
splitting
the
stock
be
like
ask
for
a
pizza
to
be
slice
into
six
piece
because
you
can
t
possibly
eat
eight
i
disagree
with
him
about
not
splitting
the
stock
say
dr
wallace
gaye
of
durham
new
hampshire
one
i
don
t
think
the
transactional
cost
be
less
and
i
don
t
think
there
would
be
speculation
if
he
split
it
to
but
that
would
make
it
easy
to
deal
with
he
lament
the
high
stock
price
say
my
dad
left
for
each
kid
and
with
that
i
can
t
buy
even
a
share
of
berkshire
for
them
michael
assael
believe
that
total
transactional
cost
and
speculative
turnover
be
less
on
the
unsplit
stock
and
that
the
berkshire
shareholder
community
benefit
from
say
be
high
grade
and
longer
term
he
also
believe
a
point
may
come
when
the
share
become
too
unwieldy
hopefully
if
berkshire
s
price
pass
pluto
and
the
share
look
as
though
they
be
become
irretrievably
illiquid
buffett
will
reconsider
but
not
to
worry
there
be
always
mutual
fund
that
could
buy
share
at
apiece
assael
say
maybe
and
perhaps
someone
will
start
a
fund
for
young
people
to
invest
in
berkshire
just
think
of
it
kid
could
shovel
snow
sell
lemonade
or
babysit
and
then
invest
their
profit
in
berkshire
for
as
little
as
say
five
hundred
buck
assael
pose
indeed
there
be
new
investment
vehicle
available
that
invest
in
berkshire
and
berkshire
related
stock
there
be

to
him
splitting

be
only
a

it
involves

a

we

in

we

i
can

remember
but
it

in

we
would
be
very
likely
to
pay
either
very
large
dividend
or
none
at
all
because
our
test
be
whether
we
think
we
can
use

in
a
way
that
creates
more
than

that
we

obviously
if
we

keep
a

have
it
become
worth
more
than
on

then
it
would

of

an
almost
bust
company
hayes
say
again
hayes
bought
a
healthy
percentage
of
the
day
s

but
not
so
much
that
the
market
could
detect
a
big
buyer
it
be
understood
thing
be
to
be
kept
quiet
he
didn

keep
it
a
secret
it

just

hayes

it

also

everything
be
to
be
on

up
and
up
we
never
trade
ahead
of
him
he
say
if
anything
be
amiss
it
be
best
to
tell
buffett
immediately
and
not
let
any
problem
fester
one
time
word
leak
about
what
buffett
be
buying
and
hayes
say
he
told
buffett
about
it
right
away
he
wound
up
trading
for
buffett
for
year
but
other
broker
who
do
not
report
problem
quickly
to
buffett
be
not
use
again
he
s
drop
broker
hayes
say
hayes
emphasize
that
it
would
be
very
rare
for
a
broker
to
leak
a
trade
but
leak
in
the
brokerage
community
often
happen
in
the
back
office
through
the
stock
transfer
agent
or
anyone
else
along
the
way
who
may
have
access
to
the
trade
or
stock
delivery
process
business
franchise
another
lesson
buffett
discover
early
be
the
importance
of
a
business
franchise
a
franchise
be
a
business
that
for
one
reason
or
another
have
a
dominance
in
the
marketplace
a
lead
business
such
as
pinkerton
s
in
a
difficult
to
breach
market
it
can
be
a
monopoly
newspaper
such
as
the
washington
post
a
strong
brand
name
such
as
general
food
a
stock
buffett
bought
in
at
about
half
its
investment
price
and
sell
in
to
philip
morris
for
about
twice
its
steadily
grow
investment
or
the
ultimate
brand
name
coca
cola
it
be
the
business
with
a
superior
competitive
edge
such
a
business
be
so
formidable
that
it
be
difficult
for
those
wish
to
compete
with
it
even
to
break
into
the
industry
something
buffett
have
try
to
do
especially
in
recent
year
be
to
seek
out
business
with
extremely
strong
franchise
impregnable
but
unrecognized
franchise
buffett
saw
an
archetype
of
this
idea
in
the
monopoly
newspaper
he
explains
the
test
of
a
franchise
be
what
a
smart
guy
with
a
lot
of
money
could
do
to
it
if
he
try
if
you
give
me
a
billion
dollar
and
you
give
me
first
draft
pick
of
business
manager
throughout
the
united
state
i
could
absolutely
cream
both
the
business
world
and
the
journalistic
world
if
you
say
go
take
the
wall
street
journal
apart
i
would
hand
you
back
the
billion
dollar
reluctantly
but
i
would
hand
it
back
to
you
now
incidentally
if
you
give
me
a
similar
amount
of
money
and
you
told
me
to
make
a
dent
in
the
profitability
or
change
the
market
position
of
the
omaha
national
bank
forerunner
of
firsttier
bank
or
the
lead
department
store
in
omaha
i
could
give
them
a
hard
time
i
might
not
do
much
for
you
in
the
process
but
i
could
cause
them
a
lot
of
trouble
the
real
test
of
a
business
be
how
much
damage
a
competitor
can
do
even
if
he
be
stupid
about
return
there
be
some
business
that
have
very
large
moat
around
them
and
they
have
crocodile
and
shark
and
piranha
swim
around
in
them
those
be
the
kind
of
business
you
want
you
want
some
business
that
go
back
to
my
day
johnny
weissmuller
in
a
suit
of
armor
could
not
make
it
across
the
moat
there
be
business
like
that
sometimes
they
re
regulate
if
i
have
the
only
water
company
in
omaha
i
d
do
fine
if
i
didn
t
have
a
regulator
what
you
re
look
for
be
an
unregulated
water
company
the
trick
be
to
find
the
one
that
haven
t
be
identify
by
someone
else
what
you
want
be
a
disguise
television
station
or
newspaper
invest
in
equity
market
summer
the
reason
one
would
like
a
monopoly
television
station
or
newspaper
be
because
most
other
business
have
to
go
through
that
business
to
advertise
that
amount
to
what
buffett
call
a
royalty
on
the
other
guy
s
gross
sale
a
payment
that
almost
every
business
in
town
must
pay
if
you
have
the
only
newspaper
television
or
radio
station
in
town
you
have
to
get
a
good
percentage
of
the
advertising
business
this
be
a
major
reason
one
not
recognize
by
many
in
the
s
that
buffett
be
buying
such
stock
as
the
washington
post
co
time
inc
knight
ridder
newspaper
medium
general
multimedia
and
affiliate
publication
which
own
the
boston
globe
buffett
also
recognize
large
advertising
firm
as
huge
business
franchise
it
be
with
the
large
ad
agency
with
global
interest
that
the
giant
global
firm
go
to
advertise
an
ibm
coca
cola
or
general
motor
be
go
to
insist
on
a
worldwide
ad
campaign
and
it
doesn
t
want
to
fool
around
with
different
ad
agency
in
different
country
instead
it
pick
an
ogilvy
mather
or
an
interpublic
group
two
firm
buffett
make
large
profit
in
before
sell
in
when
he
thought
their
merit
be
fully
recognize
buffett
reach
another
conclusion
a
number
of
poor
business
do
exist
and
it
s
best
to
steer
clear
of
them
buffett
have
stayed
away
from
big
heavy
industry
require
constant
new
investment
business
with
rise
competition
rise
labor
cost
and
rise
need
for
more
capital
except
us
airway
also
buffett
try
to
examine
the
opposite
of
a
proposition
some
good
business
have
little
need
for
new
capital
business
that
have
little
competition
and
hence
ultimately
throw
off
new
cash
durability
of
the
business
franchise
buffett
put
on
his
teacher
hat
in
a
talk
at
notre
dame
in
discuss
the
peril
of
mindless
imitation
of
peer
and
the
importance
of
durability
of
the
business
franchise
the
last
thing
i
want
to
show
you
before
we
get
into
your
question
be
an
ad
that
be
run
june
for
share
of
american
motor
this
be
a
reproduction
from
the
wall
street
journal
of
that
day
now
do
anybody
notice
anything
unusual
about
that
ad
everyone
in
that
ad
have
disappear
there
be
investment
banker
that
sell
that
issue
plus
american
motor
and
they
be
all
go
maybe
that
s
why
they
call
them
tombstone
ad
now
the
average
business
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
in
be
million
share
average
volume
now
be
time
as
large
now
here
s
an
industry
whose
volume
have
grown
to
in
year
marvelous
growth
in
the
financial
world
and
here
be
out
of
and
those
be
some
of
the
big
name
on
wall
street
and
some
of
them
have
be
around
the
long
and
out
of
have
disappear
and
that
be
why
i
say
you
ought
to
think
about
the
long
term
durability
of
a
business
because
these
people
obviously
didn
t
buying
part
of
a
business
overall
what
buffett
see
in
the
stock
market
be
a
way
to
pick
up
asset
that
produce
a
steady
stream
of
cash
buffett
buy
at
a
good
price
because
he
often
buy
only
a
part
of
a
company
not
the
whole
company
for
which
he
would
have
to
pay
a
premium
when
a
whole
company
be
put
on
the
block
everyone
look
at
the
deal
in
the
open
and
it
usually
sell
at
full
value
to
the
high
bidder
it
be
different
in
the
stock
market
you
can
buy
share
portion
of
the
business
often
quietly
with
little
competition
well
yet
you
can
operate
at
the
time
of
your
pick
you
do
not
have
to
succumb
to
what
buffett
term
the
swing
you
bum
syndrome
you
can
wait
for
the
perfect
pitch
two
inch
above
the
navel
as
buffett
say
invest
be
the
great
business
in
the
world
because
you
never
have
to
swing
you
stand
at
the
plate
the
pitcher
throw
you
general
motor
at
u
s
steel
at
and
nobody
call
a
strike
at
you
there
s
no
penalty
except
opportunity
all
day
you
wait
for
the
pitch
you
like
then
when
the
fielder
be
asleep
you
step
up
and
hit
it
look
at
all
those
beautiful
scantily
clad
girl
out
there
forbes
november
that
be
for
buffett
the
appeal
of
the
stock
market
explains
buffett
when
i
buy
a
stock
i
think
of
it
in
term
of
buying
a
whole
company
just
as
if
i
be
buying
the
store
down
the
street
if
i
be
buying
the
store
i
d
want
to
know
all
about
it
i
mean
i
look
at
what
walt
disney
be
worth
on
the
stock
market
in
the
first
half
of
the
price
per
share
be
and
this
didn
t
look
especially
cheap
but
on
that
basis
you
could
buy
the
whole
company
for
million
when
snow
white
swiss
family
robinson
and
some
other
cartoon
which
have
be
write
off
the
book
be
worth
that
much
and
then
you
have
disneyland
and
walt
disney
a
genius
as
a
partner
buffett
s
huge
network
of
knowledgeable
and
influential
friend
also
have
be
a
help
along
the
way
buffett
have
be
an
original
thinker
but
it
cannot
have
hurt
to
discus
prospect
for
a
television
station
with
tom
murphy
chat
about
a
common
investment
with
laurence
tisch
or
talk
with
jack
byrne
about
insurance
his
network
of

be
very
important
say
broker
cliff
hayes
ability
to
read
people
for
all
buffett
s
understand
of
the
inner
working
of
business
his
great
understand
may
be
of
human
nature
he
would
certainly
subscribe
to
john
d
rockefeller
s
warn
a
friendship
found
on

be
well
than
a

also
well
aware
of
the
adage

where
wise
men

his

to

he
have
to
be

original
when
the
fat
pitch
come
no
matter
how
vast
buffett
s
wealth
it
be
a
bold
move
for
him
to
take

and
buy

even
if
it
be

at

in

buffett
take
out
an
ad
in
an

say
that
berkshire
would

perhaps
because
he
s
in
the
business
buffett
often
come
up
with
idea
on
how
to
sell

have
private

write
a

that
combine

with
the
ability
of

to
bear
it
coinsurance
arrangement
vary
by

would
appear
to
be
the
way
to
go
he
write
in
a
piece
that
ran
in
the
washington

later
buffett
say
that
berkshire
would
be
happy
to
write
that
kind
of

over

another
i
quit

could
give
you
a
good
answer
another
example
be
when
he
sell

i
miss
the

still
there

citizen
and
not
universally
know
even
in

until

warren
buffett
people
be
still
ask
that
question
when
buffett
become
interim
chairman
of

because
of
buffett
s
wisdom
his
counsel
and
money
be
often
sought
when

consider
take

in
the
bidding
for

nabisco
salomon
chairman
gutfreund
call
buffett
for
advice
buffett
say
i
ll
tell
you
why
i
like
the
cigarette
business
it
cost
a
penny
to
make
sell
it
for
a
dollar
it
s
addictive
and
there
s
a
fantastic
brand
loyalty
gutfreund
ask
if
buffett
want
to
invest
in
the
tobacco
deal
with
salomon
not
this
time
buffett
say
although
he
toyed
with
the
tobacco
company
in
the
s
and
early
s
at
this
time
he
be
not
willing
to
be
an
active
participant
in
the
death
merchant
aspect
of
cigarette
i
don
t
need
to
own
a
tobacco
company
salomon
make
its
own
bid
but
the
kohlberg
kravis
robert

eventually
won
the
tobacco
giant
buy
back
stock
buffett
have
often
be
ask
about
the
possibility
of
berkshire
buying
back
its
stock
buffett
say
he
have
no
problem
with
buying
it
back
but
rather
than
just
willy
nilly
buying
back
stock
he
take
the
common
sense
approach
clearly
the
stock
would
have
to
be
at
a
good
price
and
if
berkshire
be
sell
at
a
cheap
price
it
s
quite
likely
that
would
be
at
a
time
when
something
else
be
sell
even
more
cheaply
we
d
go
wherever
we
d
get
the
most
for
our
money
he
say
at
the
annual

dead
right
about
the
big

have
say
many
time
that
every
investor
ought
to
have
a
lifetime
decision

buffett
say
his
success
be
due
to
be
right
on
a
few
big
decision
buffett
have
make
a
number
of
small
mistake
and
might
have
just
an
above

be
it
not
for
the
monumental

i
try
to
do

come
up
with
a
big
idea
every
year
or
so
forget
the
algebra
know
buffett

distrust
of
algebraic

robert
greene
a

with
robinson
humphrey
in
macon
georgia
once
sent
a

buffett
reply
thanks
for
the
secret
formula
with
its
help
berkshire
should
be
able
to
conquer
the

he
say
yes
that
it
s
important
to
build
long
last
relationship
as
soon
as
possible
he
told
the
story
of
a
fellow
who
ask
his
yardman
about
plant
a
tree
and
be
told
it
could
be
put
off
because
it
would
take
year
for
the
tree
to
grow
the
fellow
told
the
yardman
then
we
well
plant
the
tree
today
be
careful
about
prediction
prediction
be
often
wrong
and
amount
to
very
little
in
most
case
after
all
walter

state
this
prediction
in
the

be
one
of

be
experienced
not
only
by
the

by
those
of
almost
every

as
buffett
say
thirty
year
ago
no
one
could
have
foreseen
the
huge

he
didn
t
want
to
make
money
and
there
be
time
when
buffett
can
be
very
tough
on
people
buffett
will
drop
accountant
and
broker
in
an
instant
if
they
don
t
see
thing

way
but
he

an
honorable
businessman
sloan
say
no
buffett

not
a
saint
but
neither
be
he
a
fall
angel
munger
also
told
the
omaha
world
herald
february
i
ve
know
a
lot
of
people
for
a
long
time
munger
say
i
would
say
that
warren
have
change
less
in
many
decade
than
almost
anybody
else
i
know
munger
be
ask
at
the
berkshire
annual
meeting
in
how
much
buffett
have
change
over
the
year
munger
say
about
one
stone
it
take
one
to
know
one
munger
add
what
he
lewis
say
be
that
buffett
have
lose
his
soul
he
think
there
s
some
huge
change
in
the
way
warren
s
mind
work
and
of
course
there
isn
t
any
big
change
in
the
way
warren
s
mind
work
munger
go
on
to
cite
a
number
of
error
in
the
lewis
story
for
example
lewis
say
buffett
consider
backing
the
ross
johnson
bid
for
rjr
nabisco
munger
deny
this
and
say
berkshire
turn
down
the
chance
to
participate
buffett
say
emphatically
i
neither
offer
nor
give
financial
backing
to
ross
johnson
or
anyone
else
involve
in
the
rjr
buyout
berkshire
be
invite
to
participate
in
an
early
attempt
by
hanson
industry
to
enter
the
bidding
and
decline
salomon
elect
to
support
johnson
and
i
as
a
director
say
i
believe
the
transaction
would
work
well
at
a
share
neither
i
nor
other
outside
director
be
consult
about
future
escalation
in
price
on
a
sunday
in
i
be
call
in
omaha
by
salomon
and
be
ask
if
berkshire
hathaway
would
participate
in
a
small
way
in
a
purchase
offer
that
salomon
and
hanson
industry
might
make
for
rjr
the
reason
they
need
us
or
somebody
in
the
deal
be
that
each
partner
wish
for
some
reason
to
keep
its
interest
just
below
i
say
i
have
previously
conclude
that
i
do
not
want
berkshire
to
own
a
direct
interest
in
the
tobacco
business
a
decision
i
make
when
we
be
offer
a
chance
to
buy
conwood
co
a
maker
of
smokeless
tobacco
product
but
i
say
i
have
no
problem
if
salomon
itself
wish
to
proceed
and
indeed
thought
it
a
good
economic
decision
at
the
price
be
talk
about
in
the
process
of
this
discussion
about
economics
of
tobacco
i
related
a
story
told
year
before
by
father
reinert
then
president
of
creighton
university
as
he
introduce
me
to
a
creighton
class
as
someone
who
be
go
to
tell
them
a
lot
about
investment
but
he
say
the
real
secret
of
invest
be
to
buy
into
a
business
that
have
a
product
that
cost
a
penny
sell
for
a
dollar
and
be
habit
form
i
have
told
that
story
many
time
in
speech
to
business
school
and
also
at
the
berkshire
annual
meeting
to
make
the
point
about
the
economic
characteristic
of
certain
company
among
them
tobacco
company
lewis
new
republic
cover
story
also
portrayed
buffett
s
financial
success
as
pure
luck
in
the
same
way
someone
could
win
coin
toss
in
a
row
to
this
suggestion
munger
fire
this
cannon
he
s
get
the
idea
that
warren
s
success
for
year
be
because
he
flip
coin
for
year
and
it
have
come
up
head
time
all
i
can
say
be
if
he
believe
that
i
ve
get
a
bridge
i
d
like
to
sell
him
after
buffett
save
salomon
business
week
june
say
by
come
clean
with
both
investigator
and
customer
buffett
kept
the
firm
alive
probably
no
ceo
in
the
country
have
be
more
a
subject
for
the
press
or
understands
the
press
well
he
now
certainly
know
how
reporter
work
some
people
be
very
talented
some
be
not
talented
at
all
and
you
get
a
lot
in
the
middle
buffett
say
in
a
talk
to
the
omaha
press
club
omaha
world
herald
september
you
get
some
people
who
be
superethical
you
get
a
great
majority
who
be
reasonably
ethical
but
if
the
story
s
big
enough
they
might
forget
to
mention
they
be
a
reporter
for
just
a
few
minute
into
the
interview
and
you
get
a
few
who
be
patently
unethical
the
tough
part
about
it
be
essentially
there
be
no
one
virtually
with
the
exception
of
an
assassin
that
can
do
you
as
much
damage
as
somebody
can
in
the
press
if
they
do
something
the
wrong
way
as
mae
west
once
say
the
curve
be
more
powerful
than
the
sword
in
the
same
talk
buffett
add
that
over
the
year
a
number
of
reporter
have
interviewed
him
about
berkshire
and
write
glow
account
about
the
company

merit
he
say
the
same
reporter
who
write
the
story
have
call
back
ask
him
to
name
a
good
company
in
which
to
invest

a

report
that
gartman
be
quote
by

something
gartman
have
say
earlier
in

at
a
country

in

during
his
talk
gartman
lambast
the
buy

hold
investment
strategy
and
call
buffett
an

add
shame
on
warren
buffett
that
ll
be
a
good
quote
for
your
article
crippen
s

cnbc
s
melissa

try
to
straighten
out
the

he
quote
the

between
melissa
lee

gartman
melissa
there
have
be
report
that
you
have
be
quote
as
call
warren
buffett
an

gartman
laugh
and
we
want
to
just
clarify
that
do
you
call
him
an
idiot
gartman
no
laugh
melissa
and
if
so
in
what
context
gartman
i
think
mr
buffett
make
some
terrible
mistake
last
year
not
enough
action
be
take
to
mitigate
those
loss
melissa
right
ok
so
maybe
not
an
idiot
but
maybe
some
idiotic
trading
move
laugh
gartman
not
an
idiot
clearly
he
s
not
he
s
a
genius
trader
melissa
of
course
gartman
a
genius
investor
but
when
you
re
down
percent
in
a
year
i
m
sorry
i
don
t
know
how
you
can
defend
that
so
gartman
think
buffett
be
either
an
idiot
or
a
genius
it
must
have
be
a

connecticut
she
state
that
the
book
would
not
be
a
biography
of
buffett
s
life
so
much
as
it
would
be
a
biography
of
his
idea
and
the
subject
would
be
his
philosophy
of
life
and
business
a
topic
as
yet
unaddressed
in
a
narrative
style
for
a
general
audience
she
also
say
the
book
would
be
a
major
project
that
would
take
a
few
year
she
add
that
the
book
would
most
resemble
the
book
warren

have
write

m
schroeder

personal
connection
with
buffett
go
back
to
she
be
the
first
person
from
a
major
brokerage
firm
to
write
a
report
about
berkshire
and
more
significantly
she
have
buffett
s
blessing
to
do
so
buffett
call
schroeder
to
ask
her
to
do
him
a
favor
to
be
the
only
analyst
to
have
direct
contact
with
the
company
schroeder
say
he
call
this
a
favor
because
it
meant
more
responsibility
for
me
but
this
be
also
characteristic
of
his
way
of
deal
with
people
he
be
really
do
me
a
favor
schroeder
already
in
the
process
of
pick
up
coverage
of
berkshire
conclude
in
her
page
report
of
january
that
berkshire
s
intrinsic
value
as
state
in
the
report
a
price
at
which
the
stock
would
be
worth
the
same
as
a
bond
not
the
price
for
which
she
expect
the
stock
to
trade
range
from
to
a
share
the
stock
be
trading
at
at
the
time
schroeder
reject
the
view
that
berkshire
be
really
a
close
end
investment
company
whose
value
be
determine
by
the
price
of
its
security
she
view
berkshire
as
a
hold
company
whose
main
business
be
insurance
she
found
that
of
its
earnings
come
from
insurance
in
addition
berkshire
own
many
fast
grow
living
breathing
even

such
as
its

later

the

institutional
investor
all
american
research
poll
write
in
her
report
today
we
view
the
company
as
primarily
an
operating
company
that
also
have
a
sizable
investment
portfolio
she
be
not
eligible
for
the
poll
because
she
left
wall
street
to
write
the
book
buffett
have
be
quote
as
say
it
be
clear
to
me
that
she
be
a
superior
analyst
both
in
her
knowledge
of
the
insurance
business
and
in
her
willingness
to
do
the
legwork
to
garner
fact
i
believe
that
interested
investor
can
obtain
all
of
the
information
they
need
about
berkshire
from
our
publish
material
but
the
quantity
available
may
overwhelm
them
alice
may
fulfill
a
useful
function
by
organize
and
distil
the
new
york
time
january
in
schroeder
s
report
she
write
that
berkshire
be
possibly
the
most
talk
about
and
least
understood
company
in
the
world
she
say
for
an
insurer
that
can
obtain
float
at
a
reasonable
cost
and
hold
it
in
perpetuity
float
really
be
an
asset
not
a
liability
buffett
have
say
float
be
a
blessing
if
you
can
get
it
in
increase
quantity
and
get
it
cheap
particularly
at
no
or
well
yet
a
negative
cost
be
paid
to
borrow
money
be
always
a
blessing
an
investor
should
be
willing
to
pay
up
to
the
risk
free
rate
to
use
float
for
one
year
the
investor
would
for
example
be
willing
to
pay
up
to
to
borrow
and
invest
it
at
move
on
an
investor
should
be
willing
to
pay
up
to
the
amount
of
float
itself
for
the
ability
to
invest
the
float
at
the
risk
free
rate
in
perpetuity
for
example
an
investor
would
pay
up
to
for
the
right
to
invest
at
the
risk
free
rate

the
essential
message
of

be
that
at

in

something
amiss
the

controversy

surface
in

much
backing
in
the

of

appearance
and
book
signing

none
seem
to
be
in

an

s
assistant

he
be
not
do
interview
about
the

with

it
treat
me
well
than
i
deserve

i
m
willing
to
adjust
to
that
the

withholding

of
issue
with
the
content
the
schroeder
book
apparently
come
out
without
much
real
support
from
buffett
therefore
it
be
hard
to
predict
sale
it
might
sell
more
because
people
would
buy
it
to
find
some
flaw
or
less

it
didn

of
the

the

many
of
the

investment
as

his
observation
about
the
market
be
similar
to

at

chapter
reply
well
how
much
time
do
you
have
this
discussion
can
expand
to
fill
any
amount
of
time
available
but
to
keep
it
simple
we
look
at
the
company
a
number
of
different
way
but
we
focus
primarily
on
earnings
in
the
late
annual
report
warren
buffett
provide
a
rough
estimate
of
billion
for
the
company
s
see
through
or
real
economic
as
oppose
to
accounting
earn
power
remember
this
be
a
bottom
up
earnings
estimate
construct
by
look
through
to
berkshire
s
economic
earnings
interest
in
its
many
individual
holding
which
arguably
eliminates
the
need
to
decide
whether
the
p
e
price
earn
multiple
for
coke
common
be
appropriate
on
earnings
i
think
you
re
not
far
from
the
market
multiple
level
and
certainly
berkshire
s
earnings
quality
and
earnings
growth
prospect
be
superior
to
that
of
the
market
then
you
just
have
to
take
a
look
at
the
source
of
the
earnings
how
much
do
you
think
the
earnings
from
the
bank
it
own
or
its
wholly
own
business
be
worth
if
you
attribute
your
own
multiple
you
will
come
up
with
your
own
figure
it
s
really
not
as
complicate
as
some
people
make
it
out
to
be
i
think
if
you
start
off
with
the
simple
idea
that
it
s
sell
on
an
earn
power
basis
at
around
a
earnings
yield
and
then
consider
the
really
brilliant
management
that
s
in
place
at
both
headquarters
and
most
of
the
operating
company
you
will
understand
why
we
re
very
comfortable
with
our
investment
and
then
you
can
go
at
it
from
an
asset
standpoint
and
add
up
the
market
value
of
the
portfolio
and
then
try
to
evaluate
the
privately
own
operation
in
do
that
i
think
you
will
come
up
with
a
number
that
s
not
dramatically
different
from
that
derive
from
the
earnings
power
method
on
an
asset
basis
you
ll
find
that
there
s
a
premium
for
buffett
s
ability
but
it
s
my
feel
that
the
premium
be
deserve
when
warren
write
the
shareholder
s
letter
in
the
annual
report
last
month
he
say
that
he
and
charlie
munger
thought
that
berkshire
s
price
relative
to
the
company
s
business
value
be
much
more
appropriate
than
it
have
be
a
year
ago
i
think
it
s
really
amaze
when
you
just
look
at
what
buffett
s
do
if
you
read
the
annual
report
carefully
it
s
there
if
you
be
to
evaluate
his
money
management
ability
or
result
these
number
be
somewhat
inaccurate
but
they
re
not
far
off
the
portfolio
that
he
ran
in
report
on
a
comparable
basis
to
the
reporting
of
sequoia
fund
and
the
s
p
be
up
over
versus
the
s
p
which
be
up
about
and
sequoia
up
and
last
year
the
s
p
be
up
about
and
we
do
it
get
a
little
complicate
because
most
of
berkshire
s
disney
hold
be
not
own
for
the
whole
year
but
on
a
comparable
basis
buffett
be
up
well
over
over
a
long
period
of
time
he
s
be
the
tiger
wood
or
michael
jordan
of
the
investment
field
and
he
still
be
that
mind
be
still
whir
and
i
think
also
there
s
something
go
on
there
that
i
think
be
interest
in
the
past
if
you
be
to
take
the
last
annual
report
and
analyze
them
you
would
find
that
this
be
a
master
portfolio
manager
at
work
create
enormous
leap
of
value
with
the
addition
of
geico
flightsafety
catastrophe
insurance
etc
you
now
have
very
significant
well
run
wholly
own
operation
i
personally
think
that
the
umbrella
of
berkshire
hathaway
and
its
substantial
resource
permit
geico
to
be
far
more
aggressive
than
it
be
able
to
be
as
a
stand
alone
operation
if
you
take
geico
and
compare
it
to
other
great
business
it
would
rank
very
high
among
them
maybe
it
s
not
an
inevitable
but
what
s
that
second
rank
highly
probable
it
s
a
beautiful
business
and
lou
simpson
and
tony
nicely
be
just
do
a
great
job
and
that
wholly
own
business
be
now
a
very
significant
part
of
berkshire
hathaway
one
would
think
ruane
have
a
real
interest
in
money
right
apparently
not
so
forbes
october
quote
buffett
as
say
quite
the
opposite
ruane
just
isn
t
interested
in
money
and
he
s
the
most
generous
guy
i
know
the
follow
be
an
anecdote
about
buffett
that
ruane
told
at
the
sequoia
fund
s
annual
meeting
warren
be
ask
to
testify
by
cravath
swaine
moore
who
be
defend
ibm
in
the
government
s
antitrust
suit
he
be
on
the
stand
for
two
day
before
a
very
tough
judge
who
clearly
felt
no
warmth
for
ibm
and
be
pretty
outspoken
about
it
and
this
one
prosecutor
say
mr
buffett
you
believe
that
everything
ben
graham
say
be
accurate
don
t
you
warren
say
absolutely
and
the
lawyer
say
well
let
me
read
you
this
definition
of
depreciation
and
he
read
from
graham
and
dodd
this
definition
of
depreciation
which
be
pertinent
to
the
business
issue
that
be
be
raise
at
the
time
the
lawyer
then
look
at
warren
and
say
do
you
agree
with
that
definition
and
warren
say
no
well
it
s
straight
from
graham
and
dodd
and
warren
say
what
edition
be
that
the
prosecutor
pause
and
say
may
i
have
an
adjournment
for
a
few
minute
and
the
lawyer
come
back
the
next
day
and
they
still
didn
t
have
an
answer
finally
warren
say
i
think
you
ll
find
that
it
be
from
the
fifth
edition
and
that
particular
chapter
on
depreciation
wasn
t
write
by
ben
graham
it
be
cite
as
have
be
write
by
an
expert
on
utility
company
and
that
happens
to
be
the
definition
of
this
other
gentleman
not
ben
graham
and
i
don
t
agree
with
it
and
i
can
still
remember
the
judge
a
hardhearted
guy
just
look
over
the
bench
at
warren
hmmm
and
then
mr
buffett
thank
you
i
thought
he
be
go
to
ask
warren
for
a
tip
on
the
stock
market
and
you
know
sometime
thereafter
ibm
be
exonerate
i
m
not
say
it
be
due
to
warren

s
class
more
than
year
ago
there
be
to
people
in
the
class
and
we
met
only
once
a
week
so
almost
all
of
the
name
of
my
fellow
student
have
fade
from
memory
but
bill
stood
out
as
an
exceptional
mind
and
an
exceptional
human
be
we
hit
it
off
immediately
and
begin
a
friendship
that
grow
strong
every
year
one
of
the
great
joy
of
our

it
be
futile
to
try
to
do
as
much
for

as
he
do
for
us
he
simply
have
no
desire
for
the

performance
our
decision
to
reduce
our
ownership
position
during
the
year
could
be
second
guess
it
remains
our

large
investment
but
give
mr

age
and
our
level

we
felt
it

reason

five
year
he
have
say
he
can
find
stock
which
be
cheaper
than
berkshire
that
buffett
s
successor
be
unlikely
to
be
as
good
as
berkshire
and
that
he
want
a
flatter

more

loudly

clearly
that
the
law

work
against

although
the
sale
of
berkshire

be
a
debatable
strategy
it
s
also
true
that
berkshire

heard
about

of
first
manhattan
who
handle
my

arrange
for
me
to
meet

it
be
at
the
red
lion
over
share

shula
recall
that
buffett
intersperse
much
of
his
conversation
with
sport
reference
i
mostly
enjoy
his
anecdote
he
know
a
lot
about
football
he
knew
even
more
about
baseball
he
be
interested
in
our
accomplishment
of
course
he
s
a
big
university

the

say
after

he
take
us

say
agree
that
block
and
tackle
the

something
must

happen
to
him
during
this

that
begin
to
transform
his
life
i
have
work
in

then
take
a
year
off
and
study
i
begin
with
adam
smith
s
supermoney
then
i
read
the
intelligent
investor
which
be
the
most
interest
thing
i
ever
read
he
note
that
buffett
have
say
you
either
get
value
invest
right
away
or
you
never
get
it
horejsi
say
i
probably
own
the
small
of
the
major
independent
weld
supply
business
but
i
end
up
the
richest
of
all
weld
supply
distributor
in
america
i
saw
a
secular
almost
linear
decline
in
the
profitability
of
what
be
a
very
profitable
industry
when
i
get
in
it
year
after
year
the
profit
margin
shrank
as
the
competition
increase
everyone
in
the
industry
saw
this
but
everyone
else
i
know
use
their
ample
cash
flow
to
buy
more
truck
inventory
store
etc
which
just
increase
the
problem
see
this
i
take
my
cash
flow
and
put
it
largely
in
berkshire
warren
point
out
over
and
over
that
there
be
nothing
wrong
with
a
stagnant
profitable
business
just
don
t
put
more
money
in
it
one
of
the
big
value
he
brings
to
the
berkshire
portfolio
company
be
that
he
route
where
the
cash
flow
will
go
few
small
businessmen
have
the
discipline
to
do
it
but
it
be
a
huge
decision
as
to
whether
to
reinvest
in
the
business
you
know
or
to
find
a
well
one
i
found
a
well
one
and
be
very
happy
i
do
in
when
year
old
i
begin
buying
berkshire
i
bought
share
at
and
then
share
at
and
several
hundred
share
at
i
ve
bought
berkshire
time
in
my
life
and
in
of
year
i
calculate
the
low
return
be
it
really
didn
t
make
much
difference
when
i
bought
just
that
i
bought
i
always
bought
on
dip
a
coke
drinker
and
see
s
candy
eater
with
a
fondness
for

horejsi
continued
buying
berkshire
in
the
s
and
s
he
never
sell
a
single
share
or
use
margin
in
his
personal
account
he
follow
phil
carret
s
wisdom
about
not
use
margin
because
it
have
to
be
paid
back
and
that
can
force
you
to
sell
at
an
inconvenient
time
a
majorly
inconvenient
time
be
during
the
drop
in
the
stock
although
at
the
bad
point
in
early
horejsi
have
a
paper
loss
of
about
million
he
didn
t
sell
instead
he
just
hung
on
for
the
rebound
horejsi
say
he
have
no
intention
of
sell
berkshire
in
any
event
pay
tax
and
find
a
well
use
of
his
money

the
question
even
when
buffett

no
longer

canvas
horejsi

to
hold
his
stock

chip
stamp

be
a
well
investment

and
kept
buying

of
the
berkshire
annual
meeting
say
his
fund

out

much
it

out
three
time
in

before
one

but
i

i
do
it
then
i
heard
about
a

and
drove
there
a
month
after

he
say
after

george

decide
on

i
m
not
a
plunger
in
the
market
but
i
do
buy
when
i
know
the
management
i
thought
if
warren
be
run
a
company
then
i
want
to
be
in
on
it
when
i

the

i
almost
flip
i
ve
be
in
his
home
and
met
astrid
menks
who
be
a
very
warm
and
win
person
i
also
know
his
delightful
daughter
susie

the
grandchild
i
attend

on

i
sat
with
warren
s
wife
who
be
totally
captivate
and
a
real
stunner
he
want
me
to
get
to
know
her
he
s
very
proud
of
susie
and
well
he
might
be
not
only
be
she
a
knockout
she
have
all
the
right
value
they
have

remarkably
warm

pleasant
relationship
for
a
married
couple
who
live
apart
i
ve
talk
to
warren
about
his
immense
wealth
and
ask
the
logical
question
what
be
you
go
to
do
with
all
that
money
he
told
me
it
s
go
into
the
buffett
foundation

when
he
dy
he
s
go
to
leave
the
large
foundation
in
the
world
i
suggest
that
perhaps
he
ought
to
give
some
of
it
away
while
he
s
alive
but
i
don
t
think
i
make
a
dent
her
word
may
not
have
make
a
dent
then
but
in
light
of
buffett
s
pledge
to
the
gate
foundation
they
may
have
have
a
delayed
impact
in
her
column
of
april
lander
mention
that
some
reader
thought
it
outrageous
for
dentist
to
charge
folk
with
just
a
few
teeth
the
same
amount
as
they
would
charge
patient
with
all
their
teeth
here
be
a
response
that
come
from
laguna
hill
california
this
be
for
your
reader
with
only
six

and

yet
to

offer
me
a
discount
if

cost
plus
a
tip
that
s
a

i
receive
an

discount
base
on
the
amount
of

i
have
i
could
have
save
a

if
i

seem
so
bizarre
that
the
obscure

who
first
suggest
it
be
ridicule
his
lonely

if

go

will
make

possible
this

in

described
the

of

idea
it
occur
to
me
then
that
rendezvous
around
the

be
like
be
in

houbolt
say
why
take
the
whole
darn
living
room
down
to
the
surface
when
it
be
easy
to
go
down
in
a
little
tiny
craft
as
soon
as
i
saw
it
in
that
broad
context
the
concept
look
very
appeal
houbolt
scribble
some
quick
back
of
the
envelope
calculation
almost
spontaneously
he
say
it
become
clear
that

reaction
of
simplification
development
test
manufacturing
launch
and

operation
all
would

i

oh
my

this
be
it
this
be
fantastic
if
there
be
any

we
must

this

chris

p
write
houbolt
become
the
archetypal
madman
with
a

when

lor
scheme
be
show
around

it
be
universally
met
with
disdain

up

the

most

into

original
concept
for
go
to
the

be
to
fly
the
entire
spaceship
to
the
moon
but
houbolt
realize
that
lunar
orbit
rendezvous
be
a
far
well
way
to
succeed
than
fly
directly
all
the
way
to
the

or
take
the

approach
by
my
push
we
begin
to
give
more
attention
to

in
the
end
it
have
be
say
that
houbolt

plan

the

the

should
have
invest
the
saving
in

enable

to
accomplish
the

within

the
wilderness
fought
for
his
idea
finally
convincing
wernher
von

whose
backing
be
crucial
my
notion
be
that
the

to

should
be
in
a
small

houbolt
be
at

very
smart

nothing

change
my

since
after

i
always
thought

collect
almost
everything
write
about
it
i
never
sell

until
berkshire
be
about

all
my

if

foundation
and
he
say
not
to
that
the
foundation
have
plenty
of
money
i
guess
you
could
say
i
be
a
margin
clerk
who
become
a
millionaire
it
s
be
a
fantastic
ride
and
i
don

it
s
over
yet
one
of

s
great
charitable
act
have
be
steer
many
of
his

would
be

i
first
learn

buffett
in
adam
smith
s
book
supermoney
in
the
late
s
say
berkshire
shareholder
ed
prendeville
of
new
vernon
new
jersey
unfortunately
i
do
not
invest
in
berkshire
at
that
time
because
i
have
a
young
business
buying
and
sell
old
toy
train
and
all
my
money
be
invest
there
add
prendeville
owner
of
train
collector
warehouse
inc
in
parsippany
new
jersey
because
warren
s
approach
to
business
and
invest
be
rational
and
most
others
be
not
it
make
a
last
impression
on
me
then
in
december
i
bought
a
toy
train
collection
in
salt
lake
city
utah
for
virtually
my
entire
life
s
saving
plus
a
lot
more
the
collection
be
all
packed
in
a
u
haul
truck
and
i
be
drive
home
through
omaha
it
be
a
m
and
i
remember
that
warren
buffett
the
man
i
have
read
about
live
there
i
remember
think
then
i
have
well
look
into
buying
some
share
of
berkshire
when
the
train
business
produce
some
profit
a
couple
of
year
later
when
i
have
some
money
i
bought
some
share
of
berkshire
and
have
held
them
and
add
more
ever
since
it
have
be
a
hell
of
a
nice
ride
the
longer
i
own
berkshire
the
more
i
realize
what
terrific
business
it
own
and
invests
in
of
course
you
have
probably
the
best
business
and
security
analyst
and
capital
allocator
in
a
generation
possibly
of
all
time
as
your
partner
you
would
have
to
be
a
fool
not
to
go
into
business
with
warren
and
can
do
so
any
day
the
new
york
stock
exchange
be
open
fortunately
the
most
important
investment
decision
i
will
ever
have
to
make
be
when
to
sell
berkshire
and
i
may
never
have
to
make
that
decision
prendeville
say
he
s
lucky
to
be
among
early
shareholder
many
of
whom
have
have
their

of

and
andrew
have
be

an
expensive
proposition
under
any

for
prendeville
himself
who
be
battling

have
allow

time
and
he

talk
about
how
the

would
be
more
valuable
if
it
split
off
its

so
smoothly
rowsell
get

not

growth
stock
bank
he

true
that
the

when

when
the
stock
market

so
much
easy

out
a
figure
as
an
estimate
of

however
rasmussen
say
he
didn

hint
about
whether
the
figure
be
high
or
low
he
didn
t
even
touch
the
question
it
be
as
if
he

nice
try

then
buffett
get
out
and
met
carol

buffett
have
say
of
his
preference
to
talk
to
student
rather
than
adult
who
be
unlikely
to
be
as
impressionable
as
student
i
mean
i
can
go
hear
a
speech
and
i
know
whether
i
m
entertain
or
not
but
i
probably
won

change
anything

commentary
arthur
clarke
first
become
interested
in
buffett
because
he
want
money
from
him
not
for
himself
but
for
the
university
of
chicago
where
he
be
director
of
corporate
give
in
the
s
when
buffett
ask
him
what
he
like
about
fund
raise
clarke
reply
it
be
easy
enough
to
figure
out
who
have
money
the
challenge
be
to
figure
out
how
to
approach
that
person
warren
s
eye
brighten
and
he
say
i
can
see
how
that
could
be
fun
clarke
share
i
should
add
also
however
that
he
realize
one
have
to
be
deeply
commit
to
the
cause
for

have
his
life
put
together
in
a

way
it

i
put
warren

class
each
let
reason
be

therefore

only
intensified

find
a
way
to

in
the
washington

co
the
berkshire
purchase
of

the
key
i
be
look
for
most
people
would
have
pass
right
by
this
item
but
i
knew
that
warren
be
behind
berkshire
and
katharine

be
behind
the
washington

be
an
alumna
and
be
at
the

a

this
connection
give
clarke
the
lead
he
be
look
for
the
next
day
i
call
ed
to
ask
him
what
be
go
on
between
warren
and
kay
how
do
you
find
out
about
that
be
his
surprised
response
the
story
continued
from
there
but
before
long
clarke
left
the
university
to
raise
money
for
the
urban
institute
a
think
tank
in
washington
d
c
i
have
never
heard
of
the
place
but
warren
be
a
director
as
be
kay
graham
and
that
pique
my
interest
that
s
how
i
finally
met
him
when
clarke
finally
do
meet
buffett
he
told
him
the
university
of
chicago
story
i
told
him
the
experience
brought
home
to
me
his
oft
make
comment
that
arithmetic
be
not
the
hard
part
in
life
we
learn
early
the
hard
part
be
that
the
s
rarely
come
together
in
the
real
world
unless
you
be
pay
attention
you
miss
those
few
time
when
you
have
four
of
course
everybody
s
look
for
continued
clarke
and
that
s
why
they
end
up
disappointed
like
socrates
warren
be
very
wise
because
he
be
rational
therein
lie
his
happiness

clarke
be
an
astute
investor
himself
run
his
eponymous
investment
firm
of
arthur

co
in
boston
clarke
have
a
compound
annual

from
through
clarke
start
his
annual

by
write
in
our

while
the

but
bond
gain
inflation
as
measure
by
the
consumer
price
index
have
no
effect
in
his
report
clarke
have
this
to
say
about
berkshire
his
large
hold
buffett
have
be
warn
shareholder
for
year
that
success
forge
its
own
anchor
although
his
warn
be
premature
berkshire
be
now
a
plus
billion
enterprise
with
over
billion
in
shareholder
equity
but
more
than
the
weight
of
size
be
at
work
for
the
entire
year
i
ve
own
the
stock
i
have
be
regularly
ask
what
happens
if
a
truck
hit
buffett
well
he
will
be
this
summer
and
one
day
so
the
market
seem
to
be
discounting
more
and
more
this
eventuality
in
recent
year
i
think
the
business
value
of
berkshire
have
grown
faster
than
the
price
well
that
than
the
reverse
this
discounting
may
penalize
us
as
shareholder
in
the
short
run
as
it
have
from
time
to
time
over
our
year
of
ownership
it
have
also
benefit
us
by
enable
periodically
low
purchase
price
but
growth
of
business
value
determines
the
long
run
ben
graham
capture
this
well
with
the
memorable
phrase
in
the
short
run
the
market
be
a
beauty
contest
in
the
long
run
it
be
a
weigh
machine
so
what
be
likely
to
happen
when
buffett
departs
buffett
brings
two
skill
to
berkshire
unmatched
by
anyone
else
an
ability
to
allocate
capital
and
an
ability
to
motivate
an
unusually
large
number
of
manager
who
report
directly
to
him
it
be
the
first
that
enable
him
to
take
a
mediocre
textile
business
locate
in
new
bedford
massachusetts
and
compound
it
at
a
rate
of
over
a
year
and
it
be
the
latter
that
have
enable
him
to
extend
this
compound
to
the
company
s
current
size
far
beyond
what
he
and
charlie
munger
thought
possible
when
warren
dy
these
ability
will
go
with
him
berkshire
s
culture
will
live
on
for
some
time
however
and
i
think
this
be
what
warren
be
imply
when
he
joke
that
he
plan
on
run
berkshire
for
a
couple
year
through
s
ances
from
the
grave
if
the
director
will
let
me
warren
say
that
there
be
a
plan
in
place
where
his
son
howard
will
become
non
executive
chairman
howard
incidentally
last
year
publish
a
handsome
volume
of
photograph
that
show
a
person
of
remarkable
empathy
the
capital
allocation
responsibility
would
be
take
by
lou
simpson
who
for
year
have
run
geico
s
portfolio
with
distinction
out
of
an
office
in
rancho
santa
fe
ca
the
operation
side
of
the
business
would
be
handle
by
an
unannounced
person
of
course
if
buffett
life
another
ten
year
the
individual
would
likely
change
this
plan
of
splitting
capital
allocation
and
operation
have
be
use
successfully
for
the
past
ten
year
or
so
at
geico
it
neatly
separate
the
cash
investment
side
from
the
cash
generation
side
of
the
business
and
berkshire
be
a
huge
generator
of
cash
with
this
change
my
guess
be
that
berkshire
will
shift
into
a
runoff
mode
rather
than
continue
to
reinvest
the
huge
cash
flow
billion
in
the
first
nine
month
of
berkshire
will
begin
pay
out
substantial
amount
in
cash
dividend
something
it
hasn
t
do
since
the
mid
sixty
it
could
easily
handle
dividend
of
several
thousand
dollar
a
year
per
a
share
and
it
could
decide
to
spin
off
to
shareholder
the
large
marketable
security
position
coke
gillette
etc
the
changeover
could
come
with
some
short
term
turbulence
and
you
should
be
prepared
for
it
i
would
expect
that
as
time
go
on
the
market
will
increasingly
discount
buffett
s
death
and
even
overcompensate
at
some
point
the
market
should
recognize
the
cash
generate
machine
that
berkshire
be
i
assume
also
that
the
director
have
a
plan
in
place
to
buy
back
share
if
the
share
price
drop
unduly
but
restriction
on
when
a
company
can
buy
back
stock
around
significant
news
may
produce
the
market
equivalent
of
an
air
pocket
where
those
who
be
determine
to
sell
will
accept
a
price
that
would
make
a
savvy
buyer
salivate
i
read
something
recently
that
suggest
that
wise
buyer
may
be
wait
for
this
to
happen
indeed
we
could
be
buyer
too
i
think
you
should
be
prepared
for
a
to
or
more
short
term
decline
depend
on
how
much
the
market
have
previously
discount
the
news
i
would
be
surprised
if
that
last
for
long
this
eventual
certainty
keep
me
from
own
more
than
around
in
most
account
some
of
us
indeed
susan
and
i
own
a
lot
more
berkshire
be
a
remarkably
diversified
business
it
throw
off
a
ton
of
cash
year
after
year
it
be
now
one
of
only
two
aaa
rat
insurance
company
the
other
be
aig
which
we
also
own
it
currently
be
sit
on
some
billion
in
cash
and
it
be
run
by
a
man
who
think
like
an
owner
and
have
motivate
the
manager
of
the
numerous
unit
to
operate
like
owner
i
wish
i
could
find
another
berkshire
particularly
one
that
be
a
fraction
of
its
current

chris
stavrou
of
new
york
a
large
berkshire
shareholder
since
the
mid
s
have
have
brief
conversation
with
buffett
over
the
year
he
share
these
thought
background
i
go
to
wharton
and
from
there
straight
to
wall
street
to
work
as
a
brokerage
house
security
analyst
service
the
more
aggressive
institutional
money
manager
such
as
fidelity
the
acorn
fund
robert
wilson
and
george
soros
later
i
found
a
buffett
style
partnership
stavrou
partner
in
and
among
other
thing
built
up
a
massive
position
in
berkshire
hathaway
i
have
to
pinch
myself
when
i
think
how
well
it
have
all
work
out
a
great
turn
point
for
me
as
an
analyst
be
study
warren
s
methodology
and
i
be
so
impressed
with
his
character
honesty
and
intellect
that
i
christen
my
son
alexander
warren
although
i
name
him
after
leonard
warren
the
opera
singer
as
well
how
i
first
heard
about
warren
one
day
in
the
early
s
lou
vincenti
president
of
wesco
financial
start
talk
about
warren
and
become
very
enthusiastic
i
ll
never
forget
what
he
say
warren
buffett
be
the
great
financial
genius
i
ve
ever
met
a
new
book
have
just
come
out
call
supermoney
by
adam
smith
chris
don
t
walk
run
to
the
bookstore
and
get
it
there
s
a
chapter
in
it
on
warren
it
will
be
the
great
lesson
on
invest
that
you
can
get
conversation
with
warren
finally
i
met
warren
in
the
mid
s
warren
have
this
way
of
lightheartedly
answer
question
almost
seem
to
deflect
the
questioner
at
time
but
really
get
to
the
heart
of
the
question
and
its
relevance
to
invest
i
have
heard
he
have
a
photographic
memory
and
that
he
never
use
a
computer
or
even
a
calculator
so
i
ask
him
whether
it
be
true
he
never
use
a
calculator
and
he
say
i
never
own
one
and
wouldn
t
know
how
to
use
one
if
i
do
really
well
then
say
could
you
give
me
an
example
of
how
you
do
division
ten
percent
be
real
easy
seriously
how
do
you
do
more
complicate
calculation
be
you
gift
no
no
it
s
just
that
i
ve
be
work
with
number
for
a
long
time
it
s
number
sense
be
there
a
trick
the
great
mental
calculator
like
von
neumann
and
feynman
use
to
do
some
math
operation
like
addition
from
left
to
right
instead
of
right
to
left
be
there
some
way
like
that
that
you
make
the
math
easy
yeah
you
don
t
have
to
go
four
place
beyond
the
decimal
point
no
seriously
give
me
an
example
like
what
s
time

how
do
you
know
that
i
read
it
in
feynman
s
autobiography
sure
enough
if
you
read
surely
you
re
joking
mr
feynman
you
will
see
the
exact
same
question
ask
and
answer
in
the
middle
of
the
book
if
you
have
the
price
of
a
painting
go
from
to
million
in
year
what
s
the
annual
rate
of
return

how
do
you
do
that
the
union
carbide
compound
interest
table
they
only
go
out
year
you
ll
do
somewhat
well
in
stock
and
a
lot
well
if
you
live
long
enough
needle
to
say
those
table
be
nowhere
in
sight
i
m
astound
you
remember
that
the
union
carbide
table
be
the
first
computer
generate
compound
table
and
haven
t
be
publish
since
the
mid
s
if
they
only
go
out
year
how
do
you
do
a
year
calculation
here
he
go
through
a
calculation
that
i
couldn
t
quite
follow
but
the
point
be
he
didn
t
just
splice
two
table
together
mathematically
as
you
normally
would
use
square
root
he
use
other
simple
algorithm
i
d
never
heard
of
before
or
since
but
let
s
say
you
don
t
know
the
compound
interest
table
or
algorithm
for
use
them
then
you
just
go
by
the
number
of
time
it
double
double
about
time
to
get
million
a
double
every
year
or
about
a
year
do
you
use
any
of
this
stuff
when
calculate
present
value
of
cash
flow
no
no
forget
all
the
complicate
formula
just
go
through
value
line
and
when
you
find
a
company
you
really
like
and
understand
and
sell
for
half
what
it
s
worth
buy
it
and
if
you
can
t
find
it
wait
you
ll
get
your
chance
you
be
a
supporter
of
the
pugwash
group
it
be
an
anti
nuclear
war
association
found
by
bertrand
russell
its
effort
lead
to
the
first
nuclear
nonproliferation
treaty
between
the
superpower
and
the
ban
on
atmospheric
test
in
do
you
know
bertrand
russell
no
i
never
actually
met
him
i
saw
him
on
tv
and
read
a
number
of
his
book
like
principia
mathematica
no
no
not
that
sort
of
thing
the
philosophical
one
like
have
man
a
future
why
because
he
thought
like
graham
i
have
an
occasion
to
visit
warren
s
office
once
when
he
wasn
t
there
sure
enough
there
be
no
quotrons
or
computer
what
stood
out
for
me
be
the
file
room
there
be
file
drawer
when
i
subsequently
saw
him
i
say
what
s
in
all
those
file
annual
report
how
about
d
no
it
s
mostly
annual
report
and
quarterly
report
file
by
industry
do
you
have
them
go
back
say
year
no
we
cull
them
regularly
although
i
have
some
like
coca
cola
go
back
more
than
year
but
you
don
t
have
to
read
year
of
coca
cola
annual
report
to
conclude
it
s
a
wonderful
company
how
do
you
wind
up
with
so
many
if
i
m
interested
in
a
company
i
ll
buy
share
of
all
its
competitor
to
get
their
annual
report
how
do
you
find
time
to
read
them
all
i
skim
a
lot
but
if
i
m
really
interested
i
ll
read
every
single
word
cover
to
cover
intrinsic
value
intrinsic
value
be
the
discount
value
today
of
all
future
distributable
cash
generate
by
an
entity
less
the
additional
capital
include
retain
earnings
that
the
owner
must
put
in
to
generate
that
cash
a
simple
way
to
get
at
how
much
a
company
be
worth
be
to
ask
how
much
you
would
get
for
it
if
you
sell
it
today
if
your
discount
rate
be
you
be
say
you
have
the
low
risk
alternative
of
put
in
say
government
bond
that
pay
you
of
interest
which
never
grows
but
if
you
have
a
company
that
have
in
distributable
cash
that
will
grow
per
annum
forever
you
would
be
happy
to
own
that
company
and
pay
up
to
for
it
if
that
in
cash
flow
grow
a
year
forever
you
could
pay
up
to
for
it
if
it
grow
a
year
forever
you
might
even
pay
up
to
for
it
what
you
be
pay
as
a
multiple
of
cash
flow
be
equal
to
divide
by
the
discount
rate
less
the
growth
rate
multiple
divide
by
k
g
in
other
word
when
you
be
pay
for
that
bond
that
pay
of
interest
you
be
pay
or
time
interest
income
when
you
pay
for
the
grower
you
be
pay
or
time
and
when
you
pay
up
to
for
in
cash
flow
grow
a
year
forever
you
be
pay
now
you
can
see
why
you
would
theoretically
pay
time
cash
flow
for
a
grower
and
perhaps
some
phenomenal
multiple
for
a
company
that
grow
forever
the
only
problem
be
that
there
be
no
company
that
grow
their
distributable
cash
flow
at
these
high
rate
forever
but
of
all
company
what
company
or
company
come
closest
to
the
ideal
in
term
of
high
real
long
term
growth
of
cash
flow
without
massive
infusion
of
new
capital
the
master
found
many
of
them
before
us
and
they
be
concentrate
in
the
berkshire
portfolio
of
course
there
be
all
sort
of
caveat
but
clearly
these
company
be
worth
some
big
number
we
don
t
really
know
what
it
be
high

the
way
they
would
like
to
be
treat
themselves
by
feel
so
welcome
we
all
felt
at
ease
to
just
be
ourselves

with
our
chairman
produce
such
a
high
for
me
i

t
need

pain
medication
to
fly
home
mr
buffett
not
only
treat
me
like
a
fellow
shareholder
but
more
importantly
like
a
regular
human
be
which
i
believe
speaks
volume
about
the
quality
of
his
compassion
and
character
the
only
tense
moment
occur
when

be
order

surprise
that

i
give
an
inquisitive
look
to

out
of
admiration
and
to
be
his

believe
that
the
time

during

a
foundation
of
a
friendship
that
i
hope
we

to
america
from

with

a
classical

behind

she
do
not
have
a
rag
to
rich
story
but
an
early
investment
with
buffett
certainly
provide
an
enormous
boon
to
her
life
it
be
a
windfall
she
say
i
m
forever
grateful
at
she
be
invite
by
a
relative
to
stay
with
them
in
the
united
state
she
reveal
to
this
day
i
clearly
remember
the
excitement
i
felt
about
the
manhattan
peninsula
and
the
city
of
new
york
where
we
spent
three
day
stay
at
the
taft
hotel
i
particularly
remember
my
dread
at
have
to
leave
new
york
and
travel
so
far
from
what
i
felt
be
an
excite
place
to
live
my
aunt
and
uncle
who
have
come
from
nebraska
to
meet
me
on
the
other
hand
be
glad
to
get
away
from
what
they
call
the
rat
race
we
travel
to
omaha
by
rail
eat
and
sleep
on
the
train
rid
for
more
than
three
day
we
make
a
stop
in
chicago
as
an
interlude
for
a
day
or
so
to
visit
people
and
then
onward
on
the
train
what
stuck
in
my
mind
during
that
long
and
tire
train
trip
be
thought
like
these
what
a
huge
country
america
really
be
how
many
people
could
live
here
even
then
europe
suffer
from
overpopulation
also
i
be
panic
stricken
at
the
thought
of
how
i
could
ever
earn
enough
money
to
even
get
back
to
new
york
to
board
a
ship
to
get
back
to
hamburg
these
dozen
of
hour
on
the
train
must
cost
a
lot
i
knew
what
my
ship
passage
have
cost
and
i
be
fully
prepared
to
earn
enough
money
to
pay
that
back
have
obtain
an
immigration
visa
so
that
i
could
legally
work
but
to
have
this
long
train
trip
add
to
it
seem
entirely
unmanageable
to
me
these
then
be
my
key
thought
as
we
cross
the
flat
and
wide
open
terrain
of
the
midwestern
plain
after
be
married
for
about
year
and
have
three
child
mr
appley
found
herself
alone
again
divorce
it
have
be
entirely
my
wish
but
still
it
turn
out
to
be
a
most
difficult
predicament
for
me
when
all
be
say
and
do
two
third
of
my
settlement
financial
that
be
be
doled
out
over
year
my
cash
portion
the
one
third
of
the
settlement
be
meant
to
buy
a
house
i
also
need
to
buy
appliance
a
new
car
mine
have
nearly
mile
on
it
and
most
of
my
furniture
since
i
have
left
without
it
in
omaha
i
do
have
some
solid
social
connection
and
that
include
the
wayne
eve
family
wayne
be
a
long
time
friend
of
warren
buffett
and
he
have
apparently
spoken
to
buffett
about
his
concern
for
my
plight
and
my
need
to
manage
my
resource
well
wayne
eve
prove
to
be
a
most
true
friend
to
connect
me
with
warren
buffett
at
that
time
warren
have
a
limited
partnership
of
a
handful
of
investor
and
although
most
people
have
not
heard
of
him
even
in
omaha
he
just
barely
year
of
age
have
already
close
his
partnership
to
the
public
so
without
wayne
eve
s
help
i
could
definitely
not
have
enter
the
partnership
when
i
met
warren
at
a
benefit
style
show
for
the
bishop
clarkson
hospital
i
be
very
nervous
and
nearly
foul
it
up
but
fortuitously
do
arrange
to
see
him
in
his
office
a
tiny
place
with
a
lot
of
paper
as
i
recall
i
begin
by
ask
him
hard
tough
question
like
do
you
have
your
own
money
in
other
kitty
as
well
so
that
if
something
happens
you
would
be
alright
but
the
partner
would
go
down
he
answer
no
we
have
virtually
our
total
net
worth
in
the
partnership
we
eat
our
own
cooking
and
another
question
if
you
have
a
cerebral
hemorrhage
who
would
be
paid
off
first
your
family
or
your
partner
answer
my
partner
she
say
buffett
later
state
she
ask
very
tough
question
of
him
warren
also
ask
me
some
general
question
about
the
life
i
be
planning
for
myself
and
my
child
and
i
share
with
him
that
i
plan
to
go
to
school
again
sew
up
whatever
european
credit
i
have
and
eventually
obtain
a
baccalaureate
degree
which
i
do
summa
cum
laude
in
fact
and
do
graduate
study
which
i
do
attain
an
m
a
degree
he
advise
me
to
make
sure
that
i
would
stay
away
from
purchasing
a
house
but
that
i
should
rather
rent
for
several
year
which
i
end
up
do
when
i
have
ask
him
in
that
interview
if
he
could
double
my
nest
egg
in
year
be
i
to
invest
it
with
him
he
say
that
he
couldn
t
promise
anything
but
hop
to
triple
it
the
chief
reason
that
i
decide
to
dare
give
him
virtually
all
of
my
nest
egg
except
only
the
amount
i
need
to
make
a
home
for
myself
and
my
child
be
that
i
have
a
sense
of
honesty
about
warren
not
mostly
honest
or
almost
honest
but
totally
honest
and
then
some
also
of
course
there
be
that
indefinable
instinct
i
have
about
the
man
while
talk
to
him
that
i
be
sit
across
from
someone
who
be
so
unusually
able
i
told
him
then
and
there
that
i
want
to
be
in
the
buffett
partnership
and
would
bring
him
a
check
for
in
person
when
i
have
my
cash
available
he
told
me
that
he
could
not
legally
take
me
in
until
the
new
year
it
be
early
summer
then
but
he
would
take
my
fund
and
pay
percent
on
them
until
they
could
be
invest
in
the
partnership
my
age
at
the
time
be
about
and
warren
for
a
financial
wizard
be
rather
young
only
about
three
year
old
than
i
when
i
told
my
lawyer
that
i
have
invest
virtually
all
my
available
cash
with
warren
buffett
he
be
exasperate
while
he
point
out
that
he
be
suppose
to
be
a
nice
chap
alright
and
well
thought
of
he
felt
i
should
have
go
with
one
of
the
successful
and
highly
experienced
financial
type
broker
in
omaha
in
fact
my
lawyer
have
introduce
me
to
at
least
one
such
proven
financial
type
gray
and
distinguish
look
whom
i
have
already
reject
in
the
same
vein
when
i
told
my
aunt
that
i
have
give
almost
all
of
my
nest
egg
to
warren
buffett
she
say
my
god
he
be
just
a
kid
though
he
certainly
come
from
a
nice
family
his
father
be
a
congressman
and
his
family
own
a
well
run
grocery
store
why
do
you
do
that
i
couldn
t
explain
it
but
knew
in
my
heart
that
i
have
dare
correctly
in
fact
that
be
and
still
be
the
unique
thing
with
warren
buffett
that
i
could
rely
on
him
both
to
be
honest
and
do
his
work
diligently
and
with
enormous
success
to
boot
from
approximately
on
when
the
berkshire
hathaway
stock
be
purchase
for
per
share
and
that
be
my
price
for
the
irs
from
a
capital
gain
perspective
until
when
the
equity
per
outstanding
share
be
the
climb
in
equity
have
be
phenomenal
when
the
buffett
partnership
dissolve
around
the
partner
be
paid
out
in
berkshire
hathaway
stock
and
cash
at
that
time
i
do
not
know
that
i
could
have
purchase
more
stock
with
the
cash
distribution
which
i
learn
later
some
people
do
however
the
suggestion
from
the
partnership
be
that
if
one
would
want
absolute
safety
to
do
us
treasury
bill
for
cash
availability
or
otherwise
do
bond
if
one
would
wish
to
accept
some
reasonable
risk
then
to
do
a
then
brand
new
fund
name
sequoia
run
by
a
friend
of
warren
s
i
do
sequoia
with
half
of
my
cash
distribution
most
of
what
i
have
purchase
with
the
buffett
partnership
cash
distribution
do
quite
well
though
either
i
do
not
hold
stock
long
enough
or
have
not
a
significant
enough
amount
in
there
to
make
much
of
a
difference
that
be
to
say
it
make
no
real
impact
financially
to
me
nevertheless
thing
go
well
enough
when
my
husband
mortimer
herbert
appley
and
i
married
i
become
a
happy
woman
though
we
have
money
problem
almost
right
away
he
be
a
professor
of
psychology
and
a
couple
of
year
after
our
marriage
become
president
of
clark
university
where
he
serve
year
his
child
of
course
need
his
support
for
college
and
his
mother
who
be
fail
be
at
the
end
financially
needy
as
well
he
split
the
expense
of
her
care
with
his
brother
we
be
married
for
several
month
when
i
one
day
reluctantly
discuss
my
own
investment
venture
with
my
husband
he
be
so
impressed
with
how
i
be
do
that
he
encourage
me
to
venture
considerably
more
needle
to
say
that
particularly
dare
venture
i
then
undertook
i
go
into
the
stock
market
with
borrow
money
could
have
wipe
me
out
and
nearly
do
buffett
later
told
her
how
could
a
smart
woman
like
you
do
a
dumb
thing
like
that
thank
god
that
when
i
secure
that
unfortunate
loan
i
have
the
presence
of
mind
not
to
allow
my
two
sacred
cow
berkshire
hathaway
and
diversified
retailing
which
later
give
me
more
berkshire
stock
to
be
include
as
collateral
this
brings
us
back
to
the
buffett
partnership
cash
distribution
of
and
what
i
do
with
it
half
be
invest
in
rather
solid
situation
windsor
fund
standard
oil
of
california
and
diversified
mortgage
the
other
half
be
fortuitously
invest
in
the
buffett
recommend
sequoia
fund
which
be
to
gain
considerable
fame
later
for
do
fabulously
well
a
windfall
of
an
entirely
different
nature
another
unexpected
good
fortune
this
one
concern
our
lifestyle
be
the
purchase
of
a
fine
brick
home
on
nantucket
the
frederick
mitchell
house
after
two
year
of
almost
continuous
house
hunt
each
summer
and
beyond
and
deal
with
seven
separate
realtor
i
heard
about
this
house
and
go
into
cash
with
all
my
available
stock
position
include
the
very
successful
sequoia
fund
holding
but
not
of
course
the
berkshire
stock
in
june
of
be
a
bad
time
for
stock
interest
rate
be
sky
high
and
go
high
and
people
could
not
get
the
bank
to
give
them
either
loan
or
mortgage
the
irony
be
that
after
be
in
cash
for
only
a
few
month
the
stock
market
improve
somewhat
but
especially
sequoia
which
gain
almost
it
be
painful
not
to
be
participate
in
the
up
and
to
have
no
house
either
but
in
appley
be
finally
able
to
buy
her
dream
house
in
nantucket
after
a
few
year
it
become
my
wish
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
initially
i
have
paid
over
half
of
the
purchase
price
in
cash
as
a
down
payment
in
there
be
a
well
publicize
tax
advantage
if
one
sell
security
before
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
i
believe
it
be
the
stock
market
plummet
because
so
many
people
sell
security
at
the
th
hour
i
be
no
exception
just
an
hour
before
the
market
close
for
the
year
on
i
sell
enough
berkshire
stock
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
on
the
nantucket
house
and
also
take
care
of
some
other
matter
in
dollar
term
this
my
first
berkshire
hathaway
sale
turn
out
to
be
rather
stupid
especially
since
wall
street
go
sky
high
rather
quickly
in
the
new
year
the
gain
be
around
or
so
and
i
have
unfortunately
time
my
sale
for
a
tax
advantage
of
at
most
a
lot
of
america
have
fall
into
the
same
trap
though
however
it
make
more
sense
for
me
not
to
have
the
pressure
of
the
mortgage
though
i
have
sell
berkshire
stock
many
time
since
that
be
my
very
first
sale
and
it
hurt
the
most
because
the
stock
price
be
so
much
low
then
to
this
day
i
cannot
forget
that
sale
the
next
significant
sale
of
berkshire
stock
occur
when
we
have
a
disaster
in
the
nantucket
house
the
equivalent
of
two
swim
pool
full
of
water
imagine
that
much
water
be
in
our
basement
at
one
point
and
have
wash
out
some
of
the
support
foundation
of
the
house
during
those
bad
three
year
however
i
again
sell
a
significant
number
of
berkshire
hathaway
share
to
be
sure
to
have
enough
of
a
financial
backing
for
all
the
work
to
be
do
in
the
house
though
at
this
point
we
also
take
the
opportunity
to
treat
ourselves
to
some
additional
painting
and
decorate
in
conclusion
reflect
on
my
windfall
have
i
not
come
to
omaha
nebraska
i
would
never
have
met
up
with
warren
buffett
of
course
in
the
same
vein
the
good
fortune
to
own
a
very
fine
nantucket
property
which
have
be
so
positive
for
our
lifestyle
be
of
course
closely
connect
with
the
story
of
the
berkshire
stock
and
the
financial
security
and
the
confidence
it
give
me
have
i
not
be
in
the
original
buffett
partnership
i
would
have
have
neither
the
berkshire
hathaway
stock
nor
the
cash
distribution
which
year
later
enable
me
to
buy
the
house
without
have
to
sell
any
berkshire
to
acquire
it
though
this
house
be
of
course
a
valuable
investment
we
all
know
that
a
splendid
property
also
be
a
money
eater
and
not
a
moneymaker
to
have
stayed
in
stock
e
g
sequoia
fund
would
have
be
financially
speak
a
lot
wiser
nevertheless
the
house
be
to
be
sure
a
happiness
producer
for
me
and
my
family
no
question
about
that
the
really
big
windfall
for
me
of
course
have
be
my
good
fortune
to
hold
on
to
most
of
my
berkshire
hathaway
stock
appley
s
paper

in
the
interview
with

that
even
though
she
set
up
a
foundation
crut
and
also
purchase
a
boston
condo
the
statement
about
still
own

true

mohnish
pabrai
a
berkshire
shareholder
who
run
pabrai
fund
in
irvine
california
have
spent
a
good
bit
of
time
try
to
emulate
buffett
along
the
way
he
have
enjoy
big
success
such
as
a
splendid
annualized
return
for
his
fund
unfortunately
a
few
setback
have
also
occur
include
a
letter
of
rejection
from
buffett
of
pabrai
s
request
to
work
for
him
born
in
mumbai
india
pabrai
do
his
undergraduate
work
at
clemson
university
in
computer
engineering
then
he
go
on
to
illinois
institute
of
technology
where
he
finish
his
coursework
in
engineer
training
but
he
do
not
do
his
thesis
for
an
m
degree
pabrai
in
his
mid
s
say
that
until
i
have
never
heard
of
buffett
then
one
day
while
get
ready
to
take
a
flight
from
london
to
chicago
he
picked
up
a
book
by
peter
lynch
in
the
airport
the
book
mention
buffett
in
reverent
tone
and
have
an
anecdote
about
how
buffett
call
lynch
once
for
permission
to
use
a
quote
but
lynch
hung
up
on
him
at
first
think
it
be
a
crank
call
pabrai
become
increasingly
interested
in
buffett
and
read
the
book
about
him
write
by
roger
lowenstein
and
robert
hagstrom
i
felt
i
have
discover
the
holy
grail
i
read
all
his
rule
about
invest
about
concentration
about
buying
a
business
about
intrinsic
value
and
what
struck
me
be
that
mutual
fund
manager
be
not
follow
the
rule
in
physic
there
be
a
law
of
gravity
gravity
be
there
whether
you
recognize
it
or
not
i
felt
that
money
manager
be
operating
without
a
robust
framework
and
their
return
be
terrible
nobody
in
the
industry
be
follow
the
path
you
need
religiously
to
follow
the
path
pabrai
say
pabrai
ran
transtech
inc
a
software
company
but
become
more
excite
about
invest
he
sell
his
company
in
i
be
become
fascinate
with
buffett
s
approach
he
say
like
einstein
pabrai
saw
compound
as
the
eighth
wonder
of
the
world
a
investment
in
pabrai
fund
at
inception
on
july
be
worth
at
the
end
of
an
annualized
return
of
lipper
mutual
fund
data

until

i
move
i
thought
it
would
be
unfair
to
ask

i
kept

literature
we
have
ever
read
it
instantly

what
a
small
world
we
be
charm
by
charlie
munger
during
our
brief
encounter
with
him
at
borsheims
and
surprised
to
see
he
be
much
taller
in
real
life
than
we
expect
from
see
his
picture
we
have
our
first
taste
of
see

candy
and
encourage
the
relevant
party
to
establish
an
operation
in
australia
we
also
have
our

everything
in

that

any
relation
to
buffett
his
home
his
office
and
even
where

eats
they
be
most
impressed
to
run
across
buffett
drive
himself
to
his
own
meeting
in
his
rather
modest
car
and

hull
become
disenchant
with
the
lack

that

since
then
his

television
documentary
about

with
the

charity
i
want
to
get
his
message
out
for
the
great
good
say
hull
who
regard
his
film
work
about
buffett
simply
as
a
labor
of
love
i
show
him
the
first
documentary
before
broadcast
to
assure
everything
be
accurate
he
be
fine
with
all
the
content
just
say
the
name
of
his
mother
leila
be
mispronounce
recall
hull
who
then
go
to
quite
an
effort
and
personal
expense
to
fix
the
pronunciation
and
recut
the
final
version
i
think
he
appreciate
that
i
want
it
to
be
perfect
as
hull
get
to
know
buffett
and
his
family
through
interview
and
annual
meeting
he
ask
buffett
in
what
it
would
take
to
have
him
invest
north
of
the
border
buffett
told
hull
that
if
he
found
him
a
business
in
canada
to
buy
he
d
pay
hull
a
finder
s
fee
that
begin
a
challenge
that
have
not
result
in
a
purchase
yet
and
oddly
the
first
company
hull
ever
mention
to
buffett
be
an
american
company
i
brought
one
business
to
his
attention
that
help
me
well
understand
his
screen
process
it
be
a
bullet
proof
vest
business
with
one
potential
pitfall
although
hull
knew
it
have
the
metric
that
buffett
wish
for
buffett
say
that
there
be
one
uncalculable
risk
because
of
berkshire
s
deep
pocket
a
jury
might
award
a
potential
plaintiff
an
unusually
large
sum
he
see
himself
as
the
steward
of
berkshire
s
money
and
he
s
careful
in
expose
it
to
an
unknown
factor
that
could
arise
someday

i
be
far
more
interested
in
play
video
game
it
would
prove
to
be
the
most
expensive
lesson
of
my
life
in
my
father
tony
pass
away

my

no

position
with
canadian
grocer
loblaws
the
income
help
with
the
bill
but
left
very
little
for
save
for
some
strange
reason
i
often
would
read
invest
book
during
lecture
the
lesson
from
some
of
those
book
come
in

now
thankfully
be
a
university
graduate
during
my
year
at
loblaws
i
knew
i
have
to
do
something
so
i
cut
my
expense
to
the
bone
no
luxury
scrimp
save
and
invest
the
money
in
bond
and

i
drove
my

for
year
by
i
have
save
a
substantial
sum
and
be
now
dabble
in

i
say
dabble
because
it
certainly
wasn
t
invest
even
after
reading
many
investment
book
and
article
include
those
by
peter

canadian

i
be
lose
more
money
in
stock
than
i
be
make
in
early
i
decide
that
i
would
investigate
some
of
the
company
that
my
successful
mutual
fund
be
invest
in
a
particular
fund
company
in
canada
have
model
its
business
use
a
buy
and
hold
approach
within
one
of
the
fund
i
own
i
notice
that
it
have
share
of
coca
cola
american
express
and
another
company
call
berkshire
hathaway
i
visit
the
berkshire
hathaway
corporate
web
site
in
mid
and
i
decide
to
read
the
letter
to
shareholder
what
i
found
be
a
ceo
who
be
address
me
in
relatively
simple
term
with
a
dash
of
quick
wit
and
an
uncanny
ability
to
gain
my
interest
in
particular
this
passage
get
me
hooked
whatever
the
future
hold
i
make
you
one
promise
i
ll
keep
at
least
of
my
net
worth
in
berkshire
for
as
long
as
i
be
around
how
long
will
that
be
my
model
be
the
loyal
democrat
in
fort
wayne
who
ask
to
be
bury
in
chicago
so
that
he
could
stay
active
in
the
party
to
that
end
i
ve
already
select
a
power
spot
at
the
office
for
my
urn
berkshire
hathaway
letter
to
shareholder
that
be
enough
to
get
me
to
read
the
letter
to
shareholder
from
on
the
berkshire
web
site
so
every
day
for
the
next
few
week
i
would
read
one
of
the
letter
each
one
taught
me
something
new
and
it
felt
like
somebody
have
hot
wire
my
brain
the
lesson
learn
from
the
letter
to
shareholder
be
more
valuable
than
the
curriculum
taught
in
most
mba
program
my
mind
after
a
long
absence
from
school
be
suddenly
excite
passionate
and
fire
on
all
cylinder
the
idea
of
create
an
intellectual
framework
around
which
to
make
investment
decision
be
intrigue
warren
view
each
investment
decision
base
on
its
intrinsic
value
and
he
willingly
attack
the
status
quo
with

with
a
nearly
two
hour

with

around
the
office
and
introduce
you
to
the
investment

be
hesitant

accept
since
why
would
they
want
to
have
lunch
with
me
what
do
i
have
to
offer
them
i
m
only
a
small
shareholder
but
then
you
never
look
a
gift
horse
in
the
mouth
and
i
gladly
accepted
how
often
would
i
get
to
meet
prem
watsa
and
have
lunch
with
him
afterwards
i
found
out
from
francis
that
it
would
only
be
prem
and
i
no
one
else
for
lunch
when
i
arrive
at
the
office
the
staff
welcome
me
and
take
me
to
the
conference
room
i
be
told
that
prem
would
be
there
shortly
the
conference
room
contain
all
sort
of
fairfax
memorabilia
and
a
life
size
bust
of
sir
john
templeton
while
look
at
the
memorabilia
prem
s
assistant
jo
ann
come
in
and
make
me
feel
totally
at
home
she
say
that
they
have
order
lunch
into
the
office
for
prem
and
me
i
wasn
t
very
nervous
lead
up
to
the
luncheon
but
the
night
before
i
have
a
queasy
feel
again
i
be
think
to
myself
why
the
heck
would
these
guy
want
to
meet
me
i
figure
well
i
m
not
go
to
look
like
a
fool
and
i
read
all
the
fairfax
annual
report
all
night
with
only
two
hour
of
sleep
i
write
down
all
sort
of
question
on
a
notepad
and
have
load
more
in
my
head
i
didn
t
know
if
i
ll
ever
be
lucky
enough
to
meet
prem
like
this
again
and
i
be
go
to
pick
his
brain
with
a
fine
tooth
comb
when
prem
come
in
he
be
extremely
gracious
and
put
me
at
ease
within
a
minute
very
much
like
warren
he
seem
like
an
old
family
friend
or
uncle
whom
you
ve
know
for
year
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
what
we
discuss
but
that
be
not
how
prem
or
fairfax
work
and
i
promise
that
our
discussion
be
between
us
suffice
it
to
say
that
when
i
comment
on
how
the
medium
threw
the
moniker
on
prem
as
buffett
of
the
north
they
may
have
finally
get
something
right
for
once
for
nearly
two
hour
we
talk
and
talk
when
our
wonderful
indian
meal
arrive
neither
prem
nor
i
ate
much
of
our
food
because
we
be
talk
so
much
i
ask
him
every
single
question
i
have
and
he
answer
every
one
without
hesitation
what
struck
me
the
most
about
prem
be
the
fact
that
he
never
forgot
how
he
start
who
help
him
along
the
way
or
who
be
work
on
his
staff
now
there
be
an
undying
loyalty
to
prem
by
his
team
not
unlike
what
we
hear
and
see
at
berkshire
this
culture
of
trust
and
honesty
filter
through
the
whole
company
the
office
staff
vice
president
manager
and
investment
analyst
be
all
extremely
gracious
and
spent
considerable
time
with
me
i
have
arrive
at
fairfax
s
office
around
p
m
and
francis
be
still
take
me
around
to
meet
people
at
p
m
i
told
him
that
i
have
take
up
enough
of
their
time
and
tomorrow
be
a
very
busy
day
because
of
the
annual
general
meeting

all
the
president
from
the
various
subsidiary
have
come
for
the
agm
and
fairfax
set
aside
time
to
have
me
visit
some
of
the
story
of
how
people
enter
the
business
and
join
fairfax
be
quite
amaze
they
be
a
unique
group
of
individual
who
work
together
really
well
everyone
be
gift
in
his
own
right
yet
as
humble
as
their
chairman
i
ve
be
very
fortunate
to
have
met
many
people
in
the
industry
who
follow
a
similar
investment
philosophy
i
can
t
help
but
acknowledge
how
lucky
i
be
to
have
mentor
like
prem
watsa
francis
chou
tim
mcelvaine
of
mcelvaine
investment
management
and
mohnish
pabrai
of
the
pabrai
fund
they
be
the
best
at
what
they
do
and
they
have
give
freely
of
themselves
with
nothing
in
return
their
support
provide
alnesh
mohan
and
i
the
courage
to
start
our
own
investment
fund
i
m
not
sure
what
i
ve
do
to
deserve
such
friend
but
i
can
only
hope
that
i
continue
to
earn
their
trust
and
friendship
at
the
same
time
their
enormous
accomplishment
be
ambition
that
i
can
only
dream
of
and
i
will
do
my
best
to
try
and
swim
in
the
same
water
one
day
warren
be
heavily
influence
by
his
mentor
ben
graham
and
in
turn
all
of
us
perceive
warren
as
our
mentor
i
cannot
begin
to
imagine
how
many
he
will
inspire
and
where
buffett
s
legacy
will
eventually
end
for
many
people
reading
the
letter
to
shareholder
have
little
meaning
but
for
some
people
it
s
like
firework
explode
in
their
head
i
ve
heard
this
so
often
and
experienced
it
myself
you
either
get
it
or
you
don
t
and
if
you
do
get
it
it
ll
change
your
whole
life
and
the
way
you
view

like
a
domino
effect
one
obstacle
hit
another
and
you
slowly
overcome
each
one
as
you
solve
one
problem

move
on
and
on
and
on

i
adopt
a
more
concentrate
approach
to
my
business
and
investment
transaction
my
concentration
level
be
at
various
time
to
of
my
net
worth
and
today
the
four
major
position
i
own
represent
of
my
net
worth
i
become
much
more
focus
and
the
threshold
of
knowledge
and
understand
underpin
each
investment
idea
increase
dramatically
i
have
learn
from
mr
buffett
that
most
of
the
fortune
of
the
world
have
be
make
with
a
few
security
that
be
well
understood
by
their
owner
and
held
for
a
very
long
time
this
seem
evidently
clear
when
one
look
at
the
forbes
list
of
wealthy
american
every
year
it
be
clear
to
me
from
my
first
reading
of
the
berkshire
annual
report
that
mr
buffett
be
a
very
honest
and
honorable
businessman
his
thought
and
idea
be
clear
in
term
of
buying
a
piece
of
a
business
its
stock
or
the
entire
business
both
of
which
he
understood
on
the
basis
of
their
strength
and
weakness
and
those
of
their
competitor
he
also
demonstrate
how
certain
economic
characteristic
make
certain
business
more
successful
and
reward
than
others
obviously
the
right
price
and
the
right
management
make
the
investment
all
the
more
attractive
azar
s
broker
vincent
vella
of
fort
lauderdale
say
he
met
azar
in
after
azar
have
receive
some
money
from
his
father
and
be
interested
in
invest
he
be
very
eager
to
learn
and
want
to
know
everything
about
the
investment
market
he
have
a
few
bumpy
time
at
the
begin
but
as
his
education
and
knowledge
increase
he
begin
to
become
a
very
wise
investor
vella
say
he
really
gain
enlightenment
when
i
give
him
annual
report
from
berkshire
hathaway
from
that
point
on
richard
become
a
warren
buffett
aficionado
and
begin
to
look
at
investment
and
business
in
an
entirely
different
way
his
investment
skill
and
analytical
capability
begin
to
grow
at
geometric
rate
he
also
start
make
few
but
very
large
investment
decision
concentrate
in
area
he
could
understand
vella
say
that
azar
make
very
profitable
currency
trade
in
addition
to
create
his
own
company
in
trinidad
i
have
witness
his

the
year
and
watch
him
turn
a
small
amount
of
fund
into
a
net
worth
in
the
low
nine

found
a
dairy

the
amount
of
detail
of
his
knowledge
regard
the
dairy
industry
and
milk
in

be
astound
for
a

no
formal
training
as
such
in
the
field
say
kieran
lonergan
of

the
distinct
flavor
of

another
time
azar
write

munger

in
a
stable

and
good

characteristic
apart
from

then
becomes
x

in

real
for

as
if
not
expand
grow
at
y
per

never

a

able
to
grow
with

in
cash
generation
without

munger
say
there
be
no
magic
formula
azar
say
buffett
and
graham
s
three
main
idea
of
invest
the
true
fundamental
remain
as
important
as
ever
when
buying
a
stock
think
of
it
as
a
piece
of
a
business
have
a
margin
of
safety
in
regard
to
the
purchase
price
and
keep
emotional
mr
market
in
mind
know
he
be
there
to
serve
not
guide
you
however
accord
to
azar
there
s
a
fourth
pillar
to
invest
that
buffett
have
not
talk
about
much
but
have
demonstrate
over
and
over
again
throughout
his
career
this
final
element
be
courage
graham
himself
say
one
must
have
the
courage
of
your
knowledge
and
experience
if
you
have
form
a
conclusion
from
the
fact
and
know
your
judgment
be
sound
act
on
it
even
though
others
may
hesitate
or
differ
graham
say
you
be
neither
right
nor
wrong
because
the
crowd
disagrees
with
you
you
re
right
because
your
data
and
reason
be
right
many
people
have
the
concept
of
value
invest
in
their
head
azar
say
but
lack
the
courage
to
execute
their
idea
azar
think
the
fourth
item
when
use
with
the
other
three
be
the
crucial
one
he
stress
that
graham
who
write
the
intelligent
investor
for
defensive
investor
say
in
the
world
of
security
courage
becomes
the
supreme
virtue
after
adequate
knowledge
and
test
judgment
be
at
hand
in
azar
bid
for
lunch
with
buffett
unfortunately
there
be
a
high
bid
buffett
write
azar
a
note
say
maybe
the
price
of
the
lunch
will
experience
what
they
call
in
the
stock
market
a
correction
next
year
and
you
will
get
your
opportunity
on
june
azar
calculate
berkshire
s
intrinsic
value
to
be
about
and
on
june
he
figure
it
to
be
about
here
s
azar
s
work
from
june
base
on
the
two
year
discount
cash
flow
table
on
the
follow
two
page
which
be
very
conservatively
calculate
berkshire
s
intrinsic
value
could
be
in
the
range
of
to
dollar
per
share
i
use
my
conservative
core
earnings
assumption
for
between
billion
and
billion
as
the
range
or
core
operating
after
tax
earnings
for
my
estimate
i
say
could
be
because
intrinsic
value
be
pretty
nebulous
and
it
be
no
exact
science
if
i
go
out
far
into
the
future
in
term
of
the
cash
flow
forecast
the
number
sort
of
disconnect
from
the
real
world
so
i
like
to
keep
it
simple
and
do
a
year
assumption
however
a
more
simplify
approach
be
take
the
liquid
asset
of
berkshire
at
which
be
billion
of
cash
billion
of
fix
maturity
security
and
billion
of
equity
a
total
of
billion
of
liquid
asset
divide
by
share
outstanding
in
per
share
of
investment
alone
if
you
then
take
my
forecast
operating
after
tax
earnings
not
counting
any
investment
gain
or
loss
of
billion
minus
billion
of
after
tax
insurance
investment
income
you
get
to
billion
of
core
operating
earnings
not
counting
income
from
those
liquid
investment
divide
by
share
outstanding
be
of
core
earnings
per
share
time
earnings
for
the
quality
of
company
and
that
be
per
share
plus
the
of
investment
which
be
a
total
of
per
share
not
far
off
the
range
of
value
in
dcf
discount
cash
flow
analysis
with
straight
core
operating
after
tax
earnings
of
billion
inclusive
of
insurance
investment
income
but
not
realize
gain
you
have
a
diverse
group
of
earnings
from
company
with
very
strong
competitive
advantage
that
facilitates
own
more
asset
than
your
equity
would
otherwise
provide
with
no
risk
of
leverage
run
by
the
great
investor
of
all
time
berkshire
be
sell
for
billion
with
billion
of
liquid
asset
at
and
about
billion
of
operating
earnings
unassociated
with
insurance
investment
income
from
those
liquid
investment
berkshire
be
still
at
the
low
end
of
the
valuation
band
mr
buffett
taught
me
that
a
dcf
should
never
have
to
be
do
and
ben
franklin
use
to
say
the
most
exquisite
folly
be
wisdom
spun
too
fine
so
i
think
even
do
the
dcf
analysis
make
me
feel
a
little
foolish
my
conclusion
hold
on
for
dear
life

he
say
i
ve
be
interested
in

since
i
be

i
start
out
reading
a
motley
fool
book
call
investment
guide
for

the
teen
guide
to
have
more

parent
or
something
like
that
and
as
an
year
old
that
be
very
entice
to
me
for
the
novelty
of
it
all
that
book
mention
investor
and
then
i
would
read
about
those
investor
i
read
about
lynch
o
neill
and
then
when
i
read
about
buffett
that
s
when
it
really
clicked
so
i
start
reading
more
and
more
book
about
buffett
then
they
d
always
mention
graham
and
the
intelligent
investor
so
i
read
some
graham
and
his
book
the
intelligent
investor
as
well
at
the
end
of
the
day
value
invest
be
what
make
the
most
sense
to
me
for
my
high
school
graduation
present
i
decide
i
want
to
go
to
omaha
so
me
and
my
dad
head
off
to
omaha
in
it
be
a
wonderful
experience
be
in
the
presence
of
buffett
and
munger
and
listen
to
them
speak
be
just
like
everything
i
have
read
about
and
here
they
be
in
person
i
get
invite
to
play
bridge
with
buffett
but
unfortunately
i
didn
t
know
how
to
play
bridge
i
ask
the
woman
who
be
one
of
buffett
s
friend
if
she
could
teach
me
for
tomorrow
and
she
go
no
its
not
a
game
i
can
teach
you
in
a
day
so
you
re
out
of
luck
and
then
i
never
saw
her
again
what
s
a
key
thing
in
my
opinion
to
take
away
from
it
be
my
passion
for
value
invest
come
from
my
inspiration
from
berkshire
hathaway
and
buffett
this
be
just
another
example
of
how
buffett
have
create
a
culture
that
empowers
others
to
do
this
kinda
stuff
as
charlie
say
when
they
get
even
large
berkshire
can
create
a
culture
that
do
more
than
this
and
actually
help
transform
humanity

berkshire
s
rise
intrinsic
value
one
anonymous
internet
poster
record
these
thought
about
berkshire
s
intrinsic
value
i
believe
in
the
two
column
approach
also
but
use
it
to
determine
the
intrinsic
value
of
brk
it
take
awhile
to
be
comfortable
with
this
and
i
have
to
break
it
out
somewhat
differently
to
understand
it
i
name
the
two
part
inco
for
investment
and
opco
for
the
operating
company
inco
be
fairly
easy
to
determine
by
add
the
follow
from
the
balance
sheet
cash
and
cash
equivalent
fix
maturity
security
equity
security
other
investment
which
add
up
to
the
same
billion
you
derive
this
be
per
share
at
the
end
of
september
web
give
us
the
compound
growth
rate
for
both
year
and
last
year
i
think
the
year
be
most
pertinent
to
evaluate
the
future
and
in
inco
it
be
rather
than
the
year
rate
i
don
t
suggest
use
that
number
just
an
indication
of
the
trend
it
make
sense
to
me
that
the
insurance
business
be
effectively
add
into
inco
use
this
approach
opco
be
more
difficult
to
derive
from
the
info
we
have
web
tell
us
that
number
excludes
goodwill
amortization
this
be
where
the
concept
of
two
company
help
my
own
think
the
most
opco
be
a
group
of
some
odd
company
brk
have
acquire
it
have
a
growth
rate
of
the
past
year
i
repeat
for
emphasis
percent
quote
from
the
ar
as
you
can
see
from
the
two
table
the
comparative
growth
rate
of
berkshire
s
two
element
of
value
have
change
in
the
last
decade
reflect
our
ever
increase
emphasis
on
business
acquisition
ever
increase
so
opco
be
an
operating
company
grow
at
percent
compound
in
the
past
year
it
hasn
t
accomplish
this
by
increase
the
earnings
of
each
business
anywhere
near
that
growth
rate
but
rather
through
acquisition
again
quote
from
the
ar
over
the
year
our
current
business
in
aggregate
should
deliver
modest
growth
in
operating
earnings
but
they
will
not
in
themselves
produce
truly
satisfactory
gain
we
will
need
major
acquisition
to
get
that
job
do
think
iscar
as
far
as
i
know
opco
be
the
only
company
of
substance
that
have
a
plus
growth
rate
the
past
year
it
cause
one
to
think
of
the
growth
period
for
wmt
wal
mart
or
msft
microsoft
their
growth
however
be
tie
to
specific
industry
opco
s
growth
be
not
at
all
industry
specific
it
can
come
from
any
industry
and
from
all
area
of
the
world
rather
than
planning
the
next
store
or
the
next
product
opco
increase
same
store
profitability
while
wait
for
the
phone
to
ring
if
one
accepts
this
concept
one
must
adjust
iv
intrinsic
value
accordingly
as
you
say
neuro
another
yellow
brker
then
again
history
seldom
repeat
in
the
same
way
when
the
market
recognizes
this
i
believe
the
historical
chain
of
price
to
book
value
will
be
broken

the

factor
there
be
a
handful
of
risk
that
be
germane
to
an
evaluation
of
berkshire
that
we
have
delineate
in
our
past
summary
that
remain
relevant
today
we
believe
the
large
one
remains
the
inevitable
psychological
blow
and
we
suspect
follow
on
stock
price
weakness
that
would
accompany
mr
buffett
s
death
or
incapacity
the
outcome
he
have
indicate
would
precipitate
his
departure
from
berkshire
we
re
sure
that
the
stock
price
would
suffer
immediately
but
as
we
ve
say
before
we
think
one
grow
attraction
of
berkshire
be
that
mr
buffett
have
buffett
proofed
the
company
from
an
operating
perspective
and
ensure
its
long
term
success
in
his
absence
we
have
heard
only
increasingly
encourage
thought
related
to
succession
over
the
past
few
year
mr
buffett
indicate
this
year
that
he
thought
berkshire
be
in
far
well
shape
than
ever
before
with
four
qualify
internal
candidate
to
succeed
him
and
potentially
more
to
come
over
time
from
future
acquisition
it
have
also
become
increasingly
clear
that
this
item
be
get
a
high
level
of
attention
and
frequent
discussion
among
berkshire
s
board
of
director
mr
munger
opine
at
the
wesco
meeting
that
while
the
acquisition
strength
of
berkshire
would
probably
decline
under
a
successor
the
rest
of
the
company
would
continue
to
do
well
and
that
in
his
view
the
acquisition
side
would
be
fine
if
diminish
from
mr
buffett
s
rarefy
gift
in
that
area
and
he
then
sum
up
the
pretty
solid
position
berkshire
shareholder
find
themselves
in
with
a
signature
hilarious
and
blunt
one
liner
but
it
s
silly
to
complain
what
kind
of
world
be
this
that
give
me
warren
buffett
for
year
and
then
someone
come
along
who
s
bad
moreover
the
berkshire
board
have
only
gotten
strong
in
our
view
and
we
particularly
note
the
capital
allocation
credential
of
its
recently
add
member
a
year
ago
in
response
to
one
of
our
question
on
another
topic
at
the
wesco
meeting
charlie
munger
remind
shareholder
that
should
sizable
deviation
of
stock
price
from
intrinsic
value
occur
and
persist
he
knew
of
someone
i
e
berkshire
itself
with
a
little
cash
on
hand
his
comment
have
only
gotten
more
true
over
time
berkshire
currently
maintains
a
cash
balance
that
be
a
sizable
percentage
of
its
total
equity
market
capitalization
and
nearly
as
large
as
the
equity
it
hold
provide
berkshire
s
succeed
management
and
board
ample
liquidity
in
the
event
of
stock
price
to
intrinsic
value
dislocation
conversely
invest
that
cash
in
operating
company
in
a
fashion
consistent
with
past
practice
prior
to
mr
buffett
s
departure
will
help
insulate
the
company
from
senior
management
dependence
either
they
have
the
cash
or
they
get
in
exchange
an
increase
volume
of
operating
earnings
that
have
nothing
to
do
on
a
day
to
day
basis
with
headquarters
in
omaha
in
any
event
we
think
berkshire
s
position
have
be
augment
relative
to
its
past
from
both
an
appearance
and
reality
standpoint
at
the
same
time
we
be
also
cognizant
of
the
sizable
potential
for
short
term
price
dislocation
and
know
the
havoc
that
can
play
on
investor
emotion
we
would
place
stock
price
weakness
related
to
mr
buffett
s
death
or
serious
illness
in
the
category
of
a
short
term
price
shock
rather
than
a
permanent
impairment
of
fundamental
business
value
there
would
be
initial
price
risk
in
our
view
but
little
or
no
long
term
risk
of
real
capital
destruction
relative
to
the
price
we
have
paid
for
berkshire
share
in
client
account
to
berkshire
shareowner
over
the
long
term
the
upside
would
probably
be
truncate
but
that
represent
opportunity
cost
rather
than
capital
impairment
risk
nonetheless
we
remain
aware
that
this
opinion
might
be
in
the
minority
on
the
matter
especially
in
the
uncertainty
in
the
short
term
and
would
be
little
consolation
for
those
who
might
need
to
sell
into
potential
price
weakness
therefore
in
our
view
berkshire
remains
an
investment
for
longtime
horizon
great
than
five
year
investor
after
the
third
quarter
of
oak
value
revisit
and
confirm
its
optimism
about
berkshire
share
of
client
portfolio
large
position
advanced
respectably
during
the
quarter
as
the
fort
knox
of
financial
stability
stood
firm
our
long
term
hold
of
berkshire
have
be
base
upon
the
one
two
punch
of
its
advantage
business
model
and
the
seemingly
perpetual
discount
assign
by
the
market
as
reflect
in
its
share
price
though
the
share
price
advanced
during
the
quarter
and
perhaps
close
a
portion
of
the
valuation
gap
we
believe
exist
the
closing
of
the
gap
may
well
be
less
than
the
proportional
change
in
share
price
we
acknowledge
that
this
position
may
seem
counterintuitive
at
least
at
first
glance
in
the
end
we
believe
that
the
long
term
value
of
berkshire
hathaway
will
be
most
significantly
determine
by
the
company
s
continued
ability
to
source
capital
at
attractive
rate
and
to
invest
that
capital
at
attractive
return
as
be
the
case
with
all
of
the
company
we
own
on
client
behalf
we
have
analyze
this
business
with
the
reality
that
the
future
be
not
know
with
certainty
our
historically
conservative
valuation
work
on
berkshire
have
long
incorporate
the
assumption
that
cash
would
build
at
a
rate
that
would
challenge
management
s
ability
to
deploy
it
however
while
we
certainly
have
no
specific
information
on
the
matter
we
believe
the
odds
favor
the
likelihood
that
berkshire
have
use
the
recent
market
volatility
and
dislocation
to
put
a
portion
of
this
money
to
work
at
attractive
and
noticeably
high
return
than
the
company
have
be
earn
on
cash
even
in
the
absence
of
george
brumley
oak
value
remains
an
important
participant
in
berkshire

once
told

student
about
the
first
moment
of
the
salomon
crisis
and
how
he
picked
deryck
maughan
to
run
the
business
i
face
the
immediate
problem
of
decide
who
be
go
to
run
salomon
brother
the
institution
while
essentially
i
have
to
deal
with
regulator
and
the
public
and
the
politician
etc
on
friday
night
and
again
on
saturday
morning
i
met
with
about
people
these
people
be
top
level
manager
at
salomon
and
essentially
i
have
to
pick
from
that
group
of
someone
to
run
a
billion
institution
that
be
go
to
be
under
great
stress
and
who
could
lead
people
under
very
try
condition
it
may
be
of
interest
to
you
what
go
through
my
mind
because
you
re
go
to
be
hire
and
how
would
you
develop
yourself
in
some
way
that
you
be
the
one
this
be
the
most
important
hire
of
my
life
i
interviewed
those
people
saturday
morning
over
a
couple
hour
period
know
that
i
be
go
to
pick
one
when
i
get
all
through
i
didn
t
have
time
to
do
a
lot
of
psychological
test
or
anything
the
good
news
be
i
do
not
ask
them
what
their
grade
be
in
business
school
laughter
they
all
have
the
iq
just
like
everybody
in
this
room
it
doesn
t
make
any
difference
whether
your
iq
be
or
if
you
re
run
salomon
or
do
most
thing
in
this
world
they
all
have
the
energy
level
and
the
desire
the
question
be
who
would
be
the
best
leader
who
be
go
to
go
into
a
foxhole
with
me
because
whoever
go
into
the
foxhole
with
me
could
stick
a
gun
to
my
head
if
they
want
to
come
around
and
say
they
get
an
offer
from
goldman
sachs
or
something
for
twice
as
much
money
as
they
be
make
or
want
special
personal
indemnification
because
of
lawsuit
a
million
thing
could
happen
and
would
happen
with
some
people
in
the
end
i
picked
someone
and
fortunately
it
be
not
only
the
most
important
decision
of
my
life
but
probably
as
good
a
business
decision
or
hire
decision
as
i
could
make
i
devise
this
little
system
in
get
you
to
think
about
how
you
might
attack
that
problem
yourself
or
how
you
might
be
the
person
that
would
be
chosen
under
those
circumstance
imagine
that
you
have
just
won
a
lottery
i
conduct
and
by
win
it
you
have
a
very
unusual
prize
the
prize
you
get
be
the
right
to
pick
within
the
next
hour
one
of
your
classmate
and
you
get
of
the
earnings
of
that
individual
for
the
rest
of
your
life
what
start
go
through
your
mind
be
you
go
to
give
an
iq
test
or
look
up
their
grade
and
take
the
person
with
the
high
grade
be
you
go
to
try
to
measure
desire
or
energy
or
something
i
think
you
ll
decide
that
those
factor
tend
largely
to
cancel
they
could
be
important
up
to
some
threshold
limit
but
once
you
hit
those
level
you
re
ok
i
think
you
ll
probably
start
look
for
the
person
that
you
can
always
depend
on
the
person
whose
ego
do
not
get
in
his
way
the
person
who
s
perfectly
willing
to
let
someone
else
take
credit
for
an
idea
as
long
as
it
work
the
person
who
essentially
wouldn
t
let
you
down
who
thought
straight
as
oppose
to
brilliantly
and
then
let
s
say
there
s
a
catch
attach
for
the
right
to
buy
this
interest
you
have
to
go
short
of
somebody
else
in
the
room
so
in
effect
you
get
the
of
the
first
person
s
earnings
but

that

misstate
number
buffett

don
t
ask

what
the
reciprocity
implication

munger

best
protection
against

be
to
have
a

the
ideal
situation
be
to
be
able

inflation
expands

as

remain

buffett
comment
about
risk
the
best
way
to
minimize
risk
be
to
think
about
the
use
of
compensation
consultant
munger
say
i
would
rather
stick
a
viper
down

shirt
than
hire
a
compensation
consultant
in

report
buffett
say
he
be
change
the
sequence
of
the
next
meeting
so
that
the
question
come
first
and
the
official
meeting
last
as
human
nature
would
have
it
a
few
questioner
have
grandstand
with
long
monologue
about
themselves
their
business
or
their
view
of
the
world
in
past
year
we
have
make
this
change
because
a
number
of
shareholder
complain
last

about
the
time
consume
by
two
speaker
who
advocate
proposal
of

to
the

of

and
who
no

be
relish
their

a
captive
group
of
about

right
when
i
need
them
the
most
so

to

his
time
and
energy

munger
add
that
the
public
hanging
related
to
accounting
problem
at
such

probably
have
diminish

surprised

that
he
thought
the

be
honestly
conceive

that
berkshire
go
to
the
extent
of
ask
regulator
to
bless
it
reporter
ask

the
opinion
that
many

teach
a
mass
of
drivel
regard

he
say
the
key
issue
be
opportunity
cost
the
value
of

in
one
thing
versus
another
or
versus

electrify
two
minute
the

in
occur
just
week
after
marlboro
friday
when
retail
price
of
marlboro
cigarette
come
tumble
down
to
compete
with
generic
brand
cigarette
brand
manager
as
well
as
their
ad
agency
be
shaken
badly
and
many
businessmen
be
wrestling
with
the
question
of
just
how
generic
brand
be
compete
with
long
stand
famous
brand
name
sit
before
a
crowd
of
more
than
people
with
no
note
no
aide
and
no
idea
a
question
about
generic
be
come
buffett
stun
the
audience
with
his
mastery
of
the
business
scene
the
question
will
development
in
the
generic
brand
area
hurt
coca
cola
that
s
a
terribly
important
question
over
the
next
few
minute
buffett
offer
the
follow
explanation
generic
brand
have
be
with
us
a
long
time
but
lately
they
ve
attract
a
great
deal
of
attention
partly
because
they
re
do
well
and
in
particular
because
of
philip
morris
action
a
few
week
ago
when
in
reaction
to
the
threat
and
the
inroad
of
generic
they
cut
the
price
dramatically
on
marlboro
i
wouldn
t
say
marlboro
be
the
most
valuable
brand
name
in
the
world
coca
cola
be
more
valuable
and
i
think
that
s
be
proven
by
subsequent
event
but
marlboro
earn
more
money
than
any
brand
name
in
the
world
and
all
of
a
sudden
philip
morris
take
some
action
which
dramatically
reduce
the
earnings
of
that
brand
and
change
the
pricing
dynamic
that
have
exist
in
the
cigarette
business
for
many
decade
and
since
then
philip
morris
have
have
billion
lop
off
its
market
value
and
rjr
s
r
j
reynolds
suffer
accordingly
it
s
a
terribly
interest
case
study
and
it
illustrates
one
of
the
danger
of
generic
competition
philip
morris
cigarette
get
to
where
they
be
sell
for
a
pack
the
average
cigarette
consumer
us
something
close
to
pack
a
week
meanwhile
the
generic
be
at
about
or
thereabouts
so
you
really
have
a
a
year
differential
in
cost
per
year
to
a
pack
a
week
smoker
and
that
be
a
big
annual
cost
differential
you
well
have
something
that
people
think
be
dramatically
well
than
the
generic
for
the
average
consumer
to
shell
out
an
extra
a
year
it
s
happen
in
other
area
too
whether
it
s
corn
flake
or
diaper
or
a
lot
of
thing
in
our
case
i
think
the
gillette
brand
name
for
example
be
far
well
protect
against
generic
competition
than
the
main
product
of
philip
morris
although
there
always
have
be
generic
competition
in
blade
and
there
always
will
be
the
average
male
purchase
something
like
blade
a
year
he
pay
cent
each
if
he
buy
the
best
which
be
the
sensor
that
s
a
year
the
best
he
can
do
if
he
want
something
that
leaf
him
band
aid
on
his
face
and
an
uncomfortable
experience
cost
him
a
year
so
you
re
talk
for
a
day
experience
i
think
there
s
a
generic
threat
of
some
sort
in
any
industry
where
the
leader
be
earn
high
return
on
equity
it
just
stand
to
reason
that
that
s
go
to
encourage
competition
and
the
threat
may
be
accelerate
in
many
industry
but
i
think
that
brand
name
with
the
right
ingredient
be
enormously
valuable
sometimes
infrastructure
be
a
problem
for
the
generic
the
worldwide
infrastructure
for
coca
cola
for
example
be
very
impressive
and
very
hard
for
a
generic
provider
to
duplicate
but
if
somebody
want
to
sell
a
generic
box
of
chocolate
in
california
against
see
s
chocolate
that
s
obviously
somewhat
of
a
threat
and
i
just
hope
that
they
take
them
home
on
valentine
s
day
and
say
here
honey
i
take
the
low
bid
then
buffett
address
the
question
of
coca
cola
point
blank
wal
mart
s
sell
sam
s
cola
and
wal
mart
be
a
very
very
potent
force
one
thing
that
s
helpful
be
that
they
be
sell
it
as
cheap
as
a
case
here
and
i
don
t
believe
that
s
sustainable
that
s
cent
a
can
it
s
be
a
while
since
i
look
at
aluminum
and
it
s
down
but
i
think
the
can
be
close
to
a
six
cent
item
by
itself
the
can
be
far
more
expensive
than
the
ingredient
distribution
cost
trucking
stock
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
have
to
be
fairly
similar
in
a
ounce
can
there
s
ounce
of
sugar
which
at
the
domestic
price
would
be
around
cent
per
can
and
that
s
get
to
be
the
same
whether
it
s
sam
s
cola
or
coca
cola
the
coca
cola
company
sell
about
million
ounce
serving
largely
of
coca
cola
but
also
of
other
soft
drink
worldwide
every
day
if
you
take
million
and
multiply
it
by
day
you
come
up
with
billion
or
so
ounce
serving
of
coke
or
its
product
in
the
world
each
year
the
coca
cola
company
make
about
billion
pretax
last
year
that
s
one
penny
per
serve
one
penny
per
serve
do
not
leave
a
huge
umbrella
the
generic
be
not
go
to
buy
the
can
any
cheaper
and
they
re
not
go
to
buy
the
sugar
any
cheaper
and
so
on
their
truck
aren
t
go
to
be
any
cheaper
buffett
in
an
electrify
two
minute
take
the
listener
through
business
school
well
than
business
school
awesome
say
shareholder
michael
assael
buffett
s
the
best
professor
ever
a
ph
d
in
global
economics
in
one
minute
in
an
interview
cnbc
september
becky
quick
ask
buffett
about
the
effect
of
an
per
barrel
oil
price
buffett
just
wing
it
anything
that
you
import
and
we
import
maybe
million
barrel
a
day
of
oil
so
everytime
it
go
up
a
dollar
that
s
million
that
go
out
of
the
american
economy
and
go
to
somebody
else
around
the
world
and
so
it
s
a
tax
on
in
effect
a
high
oil
price
be
a
tax
on
the
american
economy
and
that
tax
be
not
paid
to
the
american
government
it
s
paid
to
various
entity
around
the
world
so
it
s
always
a
negative
but
i
ll
take
a
negative
we
have
high
price
than
this
adjust
for
inflation
year
ago
so
the
economy
can
take
it
but
it
be
a
tax
and
it
come
right
out
of
the
american
consumer
s
pocket
and
go
into
the
purchasing
power
of
somebody
in
the
middle
east
perhaps
becky
be

down
with
a
yellow

and
a
black

who
may
have
be
away
much
of

a

the
most
bizarre

buffett
follow
with

quote
from
ben

so
convenient
a
thing
it
be
to
be
a
reasonable
creature
since
it
enables
one
to
find

everything

to
do
the

the

progressively
more
difficult
throughout

and
the
final
break

the
follow
year
the
letter
be
three
page
it
start
off
it
be
a
pleasure
to
report
that
operating
earnings
in
exclude
capital
gain
amount
to
more
than
of
begin
shareholder

this
result
considerably
above
the

in
the
face
of
inadequate

in
our
textile

make
clear
the
benefit
of
redeployment
of
capital
inaugurate
five
year
ago
it
will
continue
to
be
the
objective
of

to
improve

on
total

long

debt
plus

as
well
as
the

on

however
it
should
be
realize
that
merely
maintain
the
present
relatively
high
rate
of

may
well
prove
more
difficult
than

from
the
very
low
level
of

buffett
s
business
and
investment
success
hinge
on
his
dedication
to

than
on

this

the
most
dramatic

with

aside
about
everything
from
the
intricacy
of
accounting

from
the
stock
market
to
the
fear
and

infect
human
nature

the

have
become
a
kind
of
prairie
home
companion
in
which
wall
street
be
a
lake
wobegon
and
buffett
set
out
to
tell
what
awful
truth
be
there
mr
market
the
report
be
in
full
bloom
with
a
description
of
mr
market
he
picked
up
from
ben
graham
buffett
say
anyone
in
the
stock
market
should
imagine
the
daily
stock
quotation
come
from
a
remarkably
accommodate
fellow
name
mr
market
who
be
your
partner
in
business
mr
market
flash
you
stock
quote
for
business
constantly
but
there
be
one
thing
you
need
to
know
about
this
character
mr
market
have
an
emotional
disorder
at
time
mr
market
feel
good
and
offer
high
buy
sell
price
in
the
stock
market
at
other
time
he
be
depressed
and
offer
only
low
buy
sell
price
you
be
free
to
and
often
should
ignore
mr
market
and
his
price
analogous
to
the
specialist
on
the
market
floor
and
the
buyer
and
seller
in
aggregate
who
dictate
a
stock
s
price
mr
market
will
be
back
tomorrow
with
another
price
that
may
interest
you
the
trick
be
to
know
the
difference
in
mr
market
s
emotional
offering
to
buy
when
he
be
sad
and
sell
when
he
be
happy
and
operate
on
your
own
and
not
under
the
influence
of
mr
market
s
manic
depressive
personality
buffett
counsel
that
mr
market
be
there
to
serve
you
not
guide
you
it
be
mr
market
s
pocketbook
his
money
not
his
wisdom
that
the
true
investor
be
interested
in
various
people
include
adam
smith
have
say
that
reading
the
berkshire

be
a
well
education
than
business
school
itself
an
investor
who
read
the
letter
buffett
have
write
over
the
last
year
will
have
take
in
perhaps
the
single
best
textbook
that

available

this

caveman
need
caveman
found
buffett
look
for
an
understudy
say
in
berkshire
s
annual
report
that
he
want
to
hire
a
young
person
or
perhaps
more
than
one
to
be
a
possible
successor
in
manage
berkshire
s
investment
within
minute
of
the
issuance
of
the
report
berkshire
be
flood
with
job
application
the
first
arrive
six
minute
after
the
report
be
release
so
the
search
be
on
for
a
man
or
woman
with
the
potential
to
manage
a
very
large
portfolio
to
succeed
buffett
as
berkshire
s
chief
investment
officer
cio
if
the
need
should
arise
originally
buffett
have
want
charlie
munger
who
be
old
than
buffett
to
be
the
successor
as
cio
then
as
year
pass
lou
simpson
who
be
six
year
young
than
buffett
become
the
man
of
choice
however
as
the
three
of
them
age
buffett
have
to
look
toward
the
future
buffett
acknowledge
in
the
report
that
pick
the
right
person
would
not
be
easy
the
candidate
would
need
certain
characteristic
over
time
market
will
do
extraordinary
even
bizarre
thing
a
single
big
mistake
could
wipe
out
a
long
string
of
success
we
therefore
need
someone
genetically
programmed
to
recognize
and
avoid
serious
risk
include
those
never
before
encounter
retention
be
also
a
concern
that
buffett
address
if
someone
could
list
berkshire
on
their
resume
they
would
immediately
become
attractive
to
other
firm
where
they
could
likely
make
much
more
money
lou
simpson
at
the
time
of
the
report
have
manage
geico
investment
for
more
than
year
and
be
also
serve
as
the
current
backstop
accord
to
buffett
simpson
could
have
left
that
arrangement
to
manage
great
sum
of
money
and
make
more
for
himself
by
work
somewhere
else
if
money
alone
have
be
the
object
simpson
never
consider
such
a
move
we
need
to
find
a
young
person
or
two
make
of
the
same
stuff
buffett
say
although
look
for
a
potential
replacement
buffett
offer
two
assurance
that
the
base
be
cover
for
the
time
be
he
himself
be
feel
terrific
and
lou
simpson
would
be
well
able
to
fill
in
magnificently
for
a
short
period
should
he
be
need
munger
and
simpson
be
slat
to
help
buffett
find
the
right
person
to
manage

wealth
which
include
billion
in
stock
billion
in
fix
income
security
and

of
the
chief

officer
be
a
function
that
we
hadn
t
take
care
of
although
if
something
happen
tonight
both
charlie
munger
my
partner
and
lou
simpson
would
be
fine
but
what
s
happen
be
we
ve
gotten
hundred

we
now
have

themselves
now
do
very
well
be
happy
in

all
would
like
to
come
to
berkshire
if
something
happen
to
me
tonight
and
they
would
all
be

so
the

will
know
the

of
those
four
people
if
something
happens
to
me
tonight
they
can
pick
all
four
perhaps
to
come
there
s
no
reason
for

this
differs
from

in

s

told
a
tale
that
say
a
lot
about
love
money
and
tax
through
my
favorite
comic
strip
li
l
abner
i
get
a
chance
during
my
youth
to
see
the
benefit
of
delayed
tax
though
i
miss
the
lesson
at
the
time
make
his
reader
feel
superior
li
l
abner
bungle
happily
but
moronically
through
life
in
dogpatch
at
one
point
he
become
infatuate
with
a
new
york
temptress
appassionatta
von
climax
but
despair
of
marry
her
because
he
have
only
a
single
silver
dollar
and
she
be
interested
solely
in
millionaire
deject
abner
take
his
problem
to
old
man
mose
the
font
of
all
knowledge
in
dogpatch
say
the
sage
double
your
money
time
and
appassionatta
will
be
yours
my
last
memory
of
the
strip
be
abner
enter
a
roadhouse
drop
his
dollar
into
a
slot
machine
and
hit
a
jackpot
that
spill
money
all
over
the
floor
meticulously
follow
mose
s
advice
abner
picked
up
two
dollar
and
go
off
to
find
his
next
double
whereupon
i
dumped
abner
and
begin
reading
ben
graham
mose
clearly
be
overrate
as
a
guru
besides
fail
to
anticipate
abner
s
slavish
obedience
to
instruction
he
also
forgot
about
tax
have
abner
be
subject
say
to
the
federal
tax
rate
that
berkshire
pay
and
have
he
manage
one
double
annually
he
would
after
year
only
have
accumulate
indeed
have
he
kept
on
both
get
his
annual
double
and
pay
a
tax
on
each
he
would
have
need
year
more
to
reach
the
million
require
to
win
appassionatta
but
what
if
abner
have
instead
put
his
dollar
in
a
single
investment
and
held
it
until
it
double
the
same
time
in
that
case
he
would
have
realize
about
million
pre
tax
or
after
pay
a
million
tax
in
the
final
year
about
million
after
tax
for
that
appassionatta
would
have
crawl
to
dogpatch
of
course
with
year
have
pass
how
appassionatta
would
have
look
to
a
fellow
sit
on
million
be
another
question
what
this
little
tale
tell
us
be
that
tax
pay
investor
will
realize
a
far
far
great
sum
from
a
single
investment
that
compound
internally
at
a
give
rate
than
from
a
succession
of

compound

thanks
for
visit

be
a
lifelong
technophobe
i
tiptoed
into
the
computer
world
only
a
few
year
ago
if
you
have
any
idea
about
how
we
can
make
these
page
more
useful
just
drop
me
a
line
you
probably
know
that
i
don
t
make
stock
recommendation
however
i
have
two
thought
regard
your
personal
expenditure
that
can
save
you
real
money
i
m
suggest
that
you
call
on
the
service
of
two
subsidiary
of
berkshire
geico
and
borsheims
i
estimate
that
about
of
auto
driver
in
the
country
can
save
money
by
insure
with
geico
the
figure
be
not
because
insurer
differ
in
their
underwriting
judgment
with
some
favor
driver
who
live
in
certain
geographical
area
and
work
in
certain
occupation
more
than
geico
do
i
believe
however
that
geico
more
frequently
offer
the
low
price
than
do
any
other
national
carrier
sell
insurance
to
all
comer
you
can
quickly
find
out
whether
you
can
save
money
by
call
fine
jewelry
watch
and
giftware
will
almost
certainly
cost
you
less
at
borsheims
i
ve
look
at
the
figure
for
all
publicly
own
jewelry
company
and
the
contrast
with
borsheims
be
startle
our
one
store
operation
with
its
huge
volume
enables
us
to
operate
with
cost
that

we
pas
the
benefit
of
this
low

structure
along
to
our
customer
every

borsheims
sends
out
thousand
of

afterwards
buffett
say
reduce
the

be
important
for
the

for
the

he
add
that
he
vote
for

and
back
his
plan

buffett

the
after
lunch
discussion
be
quite
uninhibited
and
the

be
articulate
and
he
listens
very
well
he
get
very
engage
in
the
conversation
and
he
be
a
very
engage
person
to
be
with
buffett
say
he
endorse
clinton
s
proposal
to
reduce
the
deficit
by
billion
over
five
year
through
a
combination
of
new
tax
and
spending
cut
the
billion
figure
be
significant
although
buffett
add
he
would
like
to
see
an
even
great
reduction
via
a
significant
energy
tax
when
ask
how
he
felt
about
the
way
the
white
house
be
function
under
clinton
buffett
say
i
ve
be
a
little
disappointed
in
the
way
congress
have
function
i
think
that
maybe
it
have
lose
sight
of
the
ultimate
goal
which
be
major
deficit
reduction
on
this
issue
it
sound
as
though
buffett
might
agree
with
mark
twain
suppose
you
be
an
idiot
and
suppose
you
be
a
member
of
congress
but
i
repeat
myself
buffett
say
wall
street
will
evaluate
the
whole
deficit
reduction
package
in
the
end
it
will
look
at
how
business
will
do
five
to
year
out
what
interest
rate
be
go
to
do
the
credibility
of
the
administration
the
ability
of
congress
to
act
there
s
a
whole
host
of
variable
it
ll
be
look
at
when
ask
what
he
thought
the
market
would
do
buffett
reply
well
the
president
didn
t
tell
us
anything
about
what
the
market
will
do
ask
if
the
market
be
overvalue
buffett
say
i
ve
never
be
a
good
judge
of
the
market
i
try
to
evaluate
specific
business
if
i
could
evaluate
a
few
specific
business
every
year
halfway
correctly
i
d
look
at
it
as
a
successful
year
i
ve
never
make
any
money
guess
which
way
the
market
s
go
question
about
whether
it
be
harder
at
that
time
to
find
undervalue
investment
he
acknowledge
it
to
be
harder
but
say
it
always
seem
hard
at
the
present
time
in
response
to
a
rumor

i
don
t

it

to

candidate
but
i
think
it
s
a
teenager
he
say
meaning
the

price
could
fall
to
the

it
have
one
of

the

in

the

john

t
have
to

about
who
spends
his

much
longer
not
if
he

october
george

at
the
time
an

with
prudential

inc
be
quote
in
the
same
piece
he
picked
the
management
that
underwrites
real
estate
the
best
but
one
thing
he
didn
t
realize
be
that
even
mark
spitz
the
former
olympic
star
can
t
swim
in
a
hurricane
in
the

so
how
be
well

at

quite
nicely

just
what
tide
do
buffett

buffett
often
kid
about
how
little
he
think
about
macroeconomics

berkshire

yves

think
that
in
the

he
see
california
as

power
in

mojonnet
also

buffett
have

worth
of
petrochina
share
other
than

only
maybe
five
u

as
much
last
year
the
total
market
value
when
i
bought
it
be
around
billion
so
i
only
paid
three
time
last
year
s
earnings
the
company
do
not
have
unusually
large
amount
of
leverage
and
this
be
unusual
have
a
state
policy
of
pay
out
of
its
earnings
in
cash
the
chinese
government
own
and
we
own
so
if

vote
with
them
together
we
control

i
have
no
contact

in
my

than

i
like
the
investment
climate
well
in
china
in

the
richest
man

have
breakfast
with
me
and
be
ask
my
consultation
if
they
should
expand

too
onerous
consider
the
sec
regs
four
month
later
khodorkovsky
be
in
prison
putin
put
him
in
he
take
on

be
finish
petrochina

the
superior
investment
choice
forty
five
percent

i
m
never
quite
as
happy
as
i
be
in
the
u

possible
the

berkshire
have
make
significant

in
and
today
hold
several
foreign
currency
he
continued
i
won
t
give
you
the
particular
in
fact
it
be
largely
irrelevant
which
currency
they
be
to
buffett
the
specific
currency
might
not
have
seem
important
information
to
share
but
the
underlie
point
be
a
major
issue
worth
state
to
hold
other
currency
be
to
believe
that
the
dollar
will
decline
both
as
an
american
and
as
an
investor
buffett
actually
have
hope
these
commitment
would
prove
to
be
a
mistake
our
trade
deficit
buffett
say
refer
to
that
of
the
united
state
have
greatly
worsen
to
the
point
that
our
country
s
net
worth
so
to
speak
be
now
be
transfer
abroad
at
an
alarm
rate
buffett
forecast
at
the
present
trade
deficit
level
foreign
ownership
of
u
s
asset
will
grow
at
about
billion
a
year
which
mean
that
the
deficit
will
be
add
about
one
percentage
point
annually
to
foreigner
net
ownership
of
u
s
national
wealth
a
perpetuation
of
this
transfer
will
lead
to
major
trouble
he
firmly
state
buffett
explain
far
in
berkshire
s
annual
report
during
we
enter
the
foreign
currency
market
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
and
in
we
enlarge
our
position
as
i
become
increasingly
bearish
on
the
dollar
i
should
note
that
the
cemetery
for
seer
have
a
huge
section
set
aside
for
macro
forecaster
we
have
in
fact
make
few
macro
forecast
at
berkshire
and
we
have
seldom
see
others
make
them
with
sustain
success
we
have
and
will
continue
to
have
the
bulk
of
berkshire
s
net
worth
in
u
s
asset
but
in
recent
year
our
country
s
trade
deficit
have
be
force
feed
huge
amount
of
claim
on
and
ownership
in
america
to
the
rest
of
the
world
for
a
time
foreign
appetite
for
these
asset
readily
absorbed
the
supply
late
in
however
the
world
start
choke
on
this
diet
and
the
dollar
s
value
begin
to
slide
against
major
currency
even
so
prevail
exchange
rate
will
not
lead
to
a
material
letup
in
our
trade
deficit
so
whether
foreign
investor
like
it
or
not
they
will
continue
to
be
flood
with
dollar
the
consequence
of
this
be
anybody
s
guess
they
could
however
be
troublesome
and
reach
in
fact
well
beyond
currency
market
as
an
american
i
hope
there
be
a
benign
end
to
this
problem
i
myself
suggest
one
possible
solution
which
incidentally
leaf
charlie
cold
in
a
november
article
in
fortune
magazine
then
again
perhaps
the
alarm
i
have
raise
will
prove
needle
our
country
s
dynamism
and
resiliency
have
repeatedly
make
fool
of
naysayer
but
berkshire
hold
many
billion
of
cash
equivalent
denominate
in
dollar
so
i
feel
more
comfortable
own
foreign
exchange
contract
that
be
at
least
a
partial
offset
to
that
position
these
contract
be
subject
to
accounting
rule
that
require
change
in
their
value
to
be
contemporaneously
include
in
capital
gain
or
loss
even
though
the
contract
have
not
be
close
we
show
these
change
each
quarter
in
the
finance
and
financial
product
segment
of
our
earnings
statement
at
year
end
our
open
foreign
exchange
contract
total
about
billion
at
market
value
and
be
spread
among
five
currency
also
when
we
be
purchasing
junk
bond
in
we
try
when
possible
to
buy
issue
denominate
in
euro
today
we
own
about
billion
of
these
by
the
end
of
buffett
have
push
the
foreign
exchange
contract
up
to
a
whop
billion
among
currency
this
be
the
second
big
bet
buffett
have
make
after
the
billion
purchase
of
general
re
buffett
s
foreign
currency
purchase
have
be
in
forward
contract
which
be
agreement
to
buy
or
sell
a
currency
at
a
specific
price
in
the
future
buffett
say
in
an
interview
bloomberg
august
that
he
be
accumulate
the
foreign
currency
as
a
long
term
bet
that
the
u
s
trade
gap
would
weaken
the
dollar
that
s
a
long
term
position
i
have
no
idea
what
currency
be
go
to
do
next
week
or
next
month
or
even
next
year
i
think
i
know
over
time
although
buffett
be
look
at
these
contract
as
long
term
investment
he
admit
that
the
reporting
of
them
in
current
market
value
could
produce
exceptional
volatility
in
report
earnings
in
give
period
consider
the
year
for
example
berkshire
s
first
quarter
report
say
that
as
of
may
the
fair
value
of
the
foreign
exchange
contract
have
fall
by
about
million
because
of
the
dollar
s
rise
then
by
the
end
of
the
third
quarter
with
the
value
of
the
dollar
have
fall
berkshire
register
a
million
pretax
gain
on
the
book
for
its
billion
in
foreign
currency
early
in
forbes
report
that
two
of
the
eight
currency
that
berkshire
held
at
that
time
be
the
euro
and
the
pound
forbes
january
buffett
start
buying
foreign
currency
contract
when
the
euro
be
worth
u
s
cent
and
kept
buying
until
the
price
reach
buffett
told
forbes
he
be
not
add
new
position
at
that
time
but
have
be
roll
over
the
contract
as
they
mature
from
january
until
the
end
of
the
dollar
fell
about
against
the
euro
in
addition
to
a
continued
trade
deficit
the
dollar
s
future
apparently
look
no
brighter
to
buffett
if
we
have
the
same
policy
in
place
the
dollar
will
go
down
he
state
in
the
forbes
article
the
forbes
story
point
out
the
unusual
nature
of
buffett
s
investment
in
foreign
currency
contract
give
his
history
of
invest
in
primarily
u
s
business
but
it
note
buffett
s
recent
acquisition
of
a
few
anti

asset
in
berkshire
bought
euro
denominate
bond
of
level
the
telecommunication

in
a
more
indirect
move
toward

berkshire
bought
the
majority
of

acquire
the

of
its

at
a
time
when
the
pound
be
worth
at
of
the
end
of
the

be
worth
so
during
that
four
year
span
berkshire
have
realize
a
paper
gain
aside
from
the
electric
company
s

power
buffett
share
his
long
term
perspective
on
the
foreign
currency
contract
once
again
in
this
early
forbes
story
state
that
he
may
hold
them
for
year
and
year
also
in
early
a
bloomberg
story
reveal
that
microsoft
s
bill
gate
have
a
short
position
against
the

i
m
short
the
dollar
gate
say
to
television
interviewer
charlie
rise
it
s
a
bit
scary
gate
admit
we
re
in
uncharted
territory
when
the
world
s
reserve
currency
have
so
much
outstanding
debt
january
accord
to
internet
story
gate
do
not
say
how
big
his
short
position
against
the
greenback
be
but
his
billion
foundation
do
receive
approval
in
september
from
china
s
foreign
currency
regulator
to
invest
as
much
as
million
in
the
nation
s
yuan
share
and
bond
thus
as
of
january
at
least
two
major
player
be
bet
against
the
dollar
but
result
during
the
remainder
of
that
year
lead
buffett
to
reevaluate
option
in
the
first
half
of
berkshire
suffer
a
pretax
loss
of
million
on
its
foreign
currency
position
the
second
quarter
report
offer
some
reminder
that
may
have
serve
to
lessen
the
sting
of
that
loss
berkshire
first
begin
short
the
u
s
dollar
in
and
since
inception
in
through
june
have
recognize
pretax
gain
of
billion
from
forward
sic
currency
forward
contract
and
have
receive
billion
from
counterparties
in
cash
but
the
loss
remain
at
year
end
total
million
at
the
end
of
berkshire
report
the
worth
of
its
foreign
currency
investment
have
be
reduce
to
billion
down
from
billion
earlier
in
the
year
berkshire
reduce
its
play
against
the
dollar
as
the
dollar
become
strong
due
in
part
to
rise
interest
rate
by
mid
year
berkshire
have
slash
its
foreign
currency
position
to
only
billion
buffett
say
he
be
make
more
investment
in
non
dollar
denominate
share
of
company
in
other
word
buying
foreign
stock
my
view
on
currency
be
as
strong
as
ever
probably
strong
we
re
do
less
with
currency
because
the
carry
cost
be
negative
there
be
well
way
of
mitigate
the
consequence
of
a
devalue
dollar
buffett
say
at
berkshire
s
annual
meeting
in
in
berkshire
s
annual
report
buffett
write
about
the
company
s
foreign
currency
experience
we
ve
come
close
to
eliminate
our
direct
foreign
exchange
position
from
which
we
realize
about
million
in
pre
tax
profit
in
that
brought
our
total
gain
since
inception
of
this
position
in
to
billion
here
s
a
breakdown
by
currency
total
gain
loss
in
million
at
berkshire
s
annual
meeting
in
buffett
say
we
think
the
dollar
will
continue
to
decline
against
most
currency
when
we
first
become
negative
on
the
dollar
we
bought
billion
in
foreign
currency
directly
then
the
carry
on
that
position
become
negative
and
it
become
expensive
to
own
more
recently
we
have
focus
on
own
company
that
generate
non
dollar
earnings
but
the
currency
a
company
earns
in
be
not
a
huge
determinant
as
to
whether
we
invest
it
be
a
factor
though
the
government
s
current
policy
will
cause
the
dollar
to
fall
far
i
don
t
know
the
speed
of
the
decline
or
when
it
will
accelerate
but
the
fundamental
force
be
strong
also
during
berkshire
s
annual
meeting
weekend
buffett
say
he
be
add
to
position
in
a
single
foreign
currency
which
he
would
recall
in
he
reveal
the
mystery
currency
to
liz
claman
anchor
of
fox
business
network
in
an
october
interview
before
do
so
however
he
make
a
point
to
clarify
that
his
bearish
play
on
the
dollar
be
now
go
in
a
different
direction
than
foreign
currency
contract
i
ve
decide
rather
than
follow
this
idea
through
currency
i
would
buy
business
with
lot
of
earnings
abroad
because
that
s
a
well
way
in
my
view
to
play
a
bearishness
on
the
dollar
after
make
that
point
buffett
give
a
short
history
lesson
on
the
brazilian
real
in
the
precede
five
year
the
brazilian
real
have
double
against
the
u
s
currency
while
the
brazilian
government
have
in
effect
be
support
the
u
s
dollar
by
buying
dollar
in
the
market
buffett
go
on
to
explain
they
have
be
building
up
their
own
reserve
their
current
account
have
turn
into
a
good
surplus
and
we
have
be
in
effect
behaving
like
people
attribute
to
the
brazilian
or
the
argentineans
or
year
ago
however
after
that
real
review
buffett
admit
to
own
some
real
and
a
few
brazilian
bond
he
make
it
clear
he
be
not
tell
anyone
else
to
buy
real
he
state
we
may
be
cash
out
of
the
real
minimize
his
investment
he
then
add
this
be
not
a
huge
position
we
ll
make
million
or
something
like
that
the
brazilian
currency
advanced
about
against
the
dollar
during
the
first
three
quarter
of
in
february
buffett
say
the
only
foreign
currency
that
berkshire
own
at
that
time
be
the
brazilian
real
the
company
no
longer
own
canadian
currency
but
have
make
several
hundred
million
dollar
by
have
do
so
buffett
admit
that
he
wish
he
have
kept
the
canadian
currency
still
bearish
on
the
u
s
dollar
in
early
buffett
once
again
predict
its
decline
we
re
still
send
about
billion
a
day
to
the
rest
of
the
world
he
say
during
an
appearance
in
toronto
where
business
wire
be
opening
a
new
office
force
feed
a
couple
of
billion
a
day
to
the
rest
of
the
world
be
not
conducive
to
a
stable
dollar

quick
what
do
buffett
and
brazilian
supermodel
gisele
b
ndchen
have
in
common
the
answer
to
this
head
scratcher
be
that
they
both
would
rather
be
paid
in
currency
other
than
the
dollar
when
news
broke
that
b
ndchen
the
former
girlfriend
of
leonardo
dicaprio
and
now
wife
of
tom
brady
prefer
to

because
of
inquiry
by
silver
trader
about
silver
s
rise
price
berkshire
let
the
word
out
earlier
in
a
press
release
berkshire
s
february
press
release
state
that
the
company
own
million
ounce
of
silver
that
s
a
gleam
silver
line
for
every
cloud
in
the
sky
and
that
it
have
no
current
plan
for
far
purchase
or
sale
of
the
silver
at
the
time
of
the
announcement
berkshire
s
precious
white
metal
stake
be
worth
about
million
briefly
up
about
million
from
buffett
s
cost
of
almost
million
or
about
an
ounce
however
in
silver
s
price
slip
and
the
investment
be
almost
a
wash
temporarily
it
do
finally
inch
up
into
the
range
again
by
the
end
of
silver
just
could
not
get
a
real
gallop
go
until
pop
up
to
a

in
more
than
double
berkshire

purchasing

finally
it
must
have
look
like
time
to
sell
accord
to
berkshire
s
press
release
berkshire
bought
the
silver
because
bullion
inventory
have
fall
in
recent
year
and
because
of
an
excess
of
user
demand
over
mine
production
and
reclamation
indeed
the
demand
for
silver
in
turn
out
to
be
about
million
ounce
compare
with
a
supply
of
about
million
ounce
during
the
summer
of
buffett
and
munger
reach
the
age
old
conclusion
that
price
should
rise
if
demand
exceeds
supply
as
the
press
release
put
it
last
summer
mr
buffett
and
mr
munger
vice
chairman
of
berkshire
conclude
that
equilibrium
between
silver
supply
and
demand
be
only
likely
to
be
establish
by
a
somewhat
high
price
so
the
muse
that
inticed
buffett
and
munger
in
their
purchasing
of
silver
for
berkshire
be
supply
and
demand
not
inflation
buffett
write
in
berkshire

annual

inflation
expectation
it
should
be
note
play
no
part
in
our
calculation
of
silver
s
value
although
accelerate
inflation
would
probably
cause
silver
price
to
rise
the
real
demand
for
silver
come
mainly
from
jewelry
and

and
also
from

berkshire

even

against

but
finally
my
dogma
be
run
over
by
my
karma
buffett
write
in
berkshire
s
annual
report
whether
berkshire
will
get
its
money
s
worth
from

i
will

no

the

one
pilot
once
told
a

would
be
typical
for
buffett
to
greet
the

talk
briefly
to
any

s

berkshire
business
he
ll
let
us
piggyback
in

say
a
borsheims
employee
sometimes
buffett
talk
to
a
passenger
or
two
about
buying
their
business
and
sometimes
he
go
through
a
pile
of
mail
but
accord
to
a
borsheims
employee
he
usually
read
the
corporate
jet
be
the
one
toy
of
the
rich
that
buffett
accepted
for
the
convenience
it
provide
munger
never
travel
in
the

he
refuse
to
get
in
it
refuse
to
condone
its
existence
he
often
kid
buffett
about
it
say
the
thing
be
a
monstrosity
against

with

munger

that
the

be
total
extravagance
and
something
with
which
he
be
not
in

but
privately
munger
say
that
if
any
ceo
deserves

it
be
buffett

that

defensible
the
very
defensible
it
didn
t
make
sense
for
me
to
own

i
thought
that
be
my
only
option
when
i
do
it
to
pay
for
four
or
five
time
the
capacity
you
need
doesn
t
make
any
sense
somebody
who
have
a
whole
airplane
be
like
a
navy
with
one
type
of
boat
they
don
t
need
one
destroyer
they
need
a
whole
array
i
m
on
a

mission
all
the
time
i

something
to
choose
from
i
never
have
that
with
the
indefensible
time
online
september
buffett
told
time
september
that
netjets
be
one
of
the
few
luxury
he
can
justify
i
sleep
in
a
bed
you
sleep
in
a

i
go
to
mcdonald
s
you
go
to
mcdonald
s
for
most
thing
in
life
be
rich
just
isn
t
that
much
of
an
advantage
the
one
area
where
money
have
make
a
difference
for
me
be
the
ability
to
travel
efficiently
and
do
thing
that
would
otherwise
be
impossible
munger
until
his
change
of
heart
or
his
counter
revelation
often
travel
on
commercial

flight
carry
his
own

he
show
up
at
borsheims
once
carry
his
own
luggage
a
suitcase
in
each
hand
munger
finally
threw
financial
caution
to
the
wind
and
sign
up
as
a
netjets
customer
after
a
little
push
from
buffett
when
munger
ever
the
coach
flyer
express
some
hesitation
buffett
told
him
he
would
get
him
a
seat
in
the
back
of
the
plane
the
story
of
warren
buffett
of
permanent
value
the
indefensible

charles
munger
our
experience
tends
to
confirm
a
long
held
notion
that
be
prepared
on
a
few
occasion
in
a
lifetime
to
act
promptly
in
scale
in
do
some
simple
and
logical
thing
will
often
dramatically
improve
the
financial
result
of
that
lifetime
a
few
major
opportunity
clearly
recognizable
as
such
will
usually
come
to
one
who
continuously
search
and
wait
with
a
curious
mind
love
diagnosis
involve
multiple
variable
and
then
all
that
be
require
be
a
willingness
to
bet
heavily
when
the
odds
be
extremely
favorable
use
resource
available
as
a
result
of
prudence
and
patience
in
the
past
charles
munger
wesco
annual
report
berkshire
vice
chairman
charles
munger
say
one
of
the
turn
point
for
berkshire
be
the
purchase
of
see
s
candy
he
note
it
be
acquire
at
a
premium
over
book
value
and
it
work
hochschild
kohn
the
department
store
chain
be
bought
at
a
discount
it
didn
t
work
those
two
thing
together
help
shift
our
think
to
the
idea
of
pay
high
price
for
well
business
interview
may
with
see
s
candy
buffett
and
munger
learn
the
real
lesson
of
pricing
power
see
s
be
purchase
for
three
time
its
book
value
far
more
than
buffett
and
munger
usually
paid
for
a
business
but
see
s
have
a
quality
product
and
quality
service
see
s
have
give
berkshire
excellent
return
over
the
year
munger
say
it
also
help
when
you
get
high
return
on
a
large
amount
of
capital
as
be
the
case
with
berkshire
s
investment
in
the
washington
post
and
coca
cola
the
post
take
a
fair
amount
of
the
capital
available
to
us
at
the
time
he
add
at
no
time
be
there
a
point
when
berkshire
might
have
go
off
the
track
i
knew
it
would
do
well
but
not
this
well
at
wesco
s
annual
meeting
in
munger
discuss
buffett
as
an
investor
warren
buffett
come
to
invest
at
the
knee
of
ben
graham
who
ran
a
geiger
counter
over
the
detritus
of
the
s
stock
be
ridiculously
cheap
graham
bought
company
that
be
quite
mediocre
on
average
but
make
when
their
stock
bounce
warren
train
under
this
system
and
make
money
so
he
be
slow
to
come
to
the
idea
i
learn
that
the
best
way
to
make
money
be
to
buy
great
business
that
earn
high
return
on
capital
over
long
period
of
time
we
re
apply
graham
s
basic
idea
but
now
we
re
try
to
find
undervalue
great
company
that
concept
be
foreign
to
ben
graham
warren
would
have
morph
into
a
great
investor
without
ben
graham
he
be
a
great
investor
than
graham
be
warren
would
have
be
great
have
he
never
met
anyone
else
he
would
have
excel
at
any
field
that
require
a
high
iq
quantitative
skill
and
risk
take
he
wouldn
t
have
do
well
at
ballet
though
buffett
once
described
to
forbes
january
the
impact
munger
have
on
his
investment
style
charlie
shove
me
in
the
direction
of
not
just
buying
bargain
as
ben
graham
have
taught
me
this
be
the
real
impact
he
have
on
me
it
take
a
powerful
force
to
move
me
on
from
graham
s
limit
view
it
be
the
power
of
charlie
s
mind
he
expand
my
horizon
buffett
have
say
munger
s
impact
on
him
have
be
huge
accord
to
the
omaha
world
herald
may
charlie
have
always
emphasize
let
s
buy
truly
wonderful
business
buffett
say
i
fool
around
a
little
more
with
cigar
butt
too
often
i
be
look
at
something
that
be
sell
at
a
big
discount
from
work
capital
charlie
know
that
game
and
he
felt
that
s
not
the
direction
we
should
go
he
be
a
significant
factor
in
take
me
consistently
away
from
it
in
recent
year
they
have
talk
less
but
some
investor
be
surprised
at
buffett
s
quote
in
business
week
july
charlie
and
i
don
t
talk
a
lot
anymore
add
that
he
do
not
consult
munger
on
the
general
re
purchase
the
business
week
story
offer
some
explanatory
remark
by
all
account
include
their
own
munger
and
buffett
have
not
fall
out
but
while
buffett
be
wholly
devote
to
berkshire
munger
now
spends
his
time
chair
a
non
profit
hospital
and
serve
as
a
trustee
of
a
private
high
school
charlie
be
broader
in
his
interest
than
i
be
buffett
say
he
doesn
t
have
the
same
intensity
for
berkshire
that
i
have
it
s
not
his
baby
munger
concurs
warren
s
whole
ego
be
pour
into
berkshire
still
buffett
told
forbes
october
our
relationship
be
the
same
as
it
have
be
for
year
in
the
foreword
to
janet
lowe
s
book
about
munger
damn
right
buffett
say
charlie
be
one
of
a
kind
what
make
charlie
special
be
his
character
his
mind
be
breathtaking
he
s
as
bright
as
any
person
i
ve
ever
met
and
at
still
have
a
memory
i
would
kill
for
he
be
born
though
with
these
ability
it
s
how
he
have
elect
to
use
them
that
make
me
regard
him
so
highly
in
year
i
have
never
see
charlie
try
to
take
advantage
of
anyone
nor
have
i
see
him
claim
the
least
bit
of
credit
for
anything
that
he
didn
t
do
in
fact
i
ve
witness
exactly
the
opposite
he
have
knowingly
let
me
and
others
have
the
well
end
of
a
deal
and
he
have
also
always
shoulder
more
than
his
share
of
the
blame
when
thing
go
wrong
and
accepted
less
than
his
share
of
credit
when
the
reverse
have
be
true
he
be
generous
in
the
deepest
sense
and
he
never
let
ego
interfere
with
rationality
unlike
most
individual
who
hunger
for
the
world
s
approval
charlie
judge
himself
entirely
by
an
inner
scorecard
and
he
s
a
tough
grader
janet
lowe
damn
right
p
iii
by
now
warren
know
pretty
much
everything
i
think
munger
be
quote
as
say
once
in
a
while
i
ll
know
something
that
s
useful
to
him
fortune
november
buffett
have
acknowledge
move
somewhat
away
from
graham
s
bargain
basement
tactic
ben
graham
want
everything
to
be
a
quantitative
bargain
i
want
it
to
be
a
quantitative
bargain
in
term
of
future
stream
of
cash
forbes
october
munger
who
receives
no
compensation
as
wesco
s
ceo
say
at
the
wesco
annual
meeting
in
the
basic
concept
of
value
to
a
private
owner
and
be
motivate
when
you
re
buying
and
sell
security
by
reference
to
intrinsic
value
instead
of
price
momentum
i
don
t
think
that
will
ever
be
outdated
but
ben
graham
have
blind
spot
he
have
too
low
an
appreciation
of
the
fact
that
some
business
be
worth
pay
big
premium
for
in
a
creditable
footnote
to
one
edition
of
the
intelligent
investor
he
graham
sheepishly
say
that
he
d
practice
this
one
value
system
for
a
long
time
and
achieve
a
very
respectable
record
do
it
but
he
get
rich
in
a
hurry
by
buying
one
growth
stock
investment
it
amuse
him
that
half
or
more
of
his
fortune
come
to
him
from
one
investment
geico
graham
be
insufficiently
aware
of
the
possibility
that
a
company
could
prove
a
great
hold
for
a
long
time
even
when
it
sell
at
a
large
multiple
of
book
value
look
at
coca
cola
stock
it
have
a
very
minor
book
value
compare
to
its
current
price
you
will
notice
that
we
re
not
follow
classic
graham
and
dodd
to
the
last
detail
as
it
be
in
ben
graham
s
mind
both
warren
and
i
sometimes
wonder
what
would
have
happen
if
we
d
start
out
in
well
business
instead
of
trading
stamp
aluminum
textile
company
we
even
have
a
windmill
company
at
one
time
it
take
us
a
long
time
to
wise
up
munger
be
buffett
s
friend
soul
mate
sidekick
and
interchangeable
partner
buffett
like
to
joke
that
munger
be
his
junior
partner
in
good
year
and
senior
partner
in
bad
year
when
reporter
cannot
get
buffett
which
be
most
of
the
time
they
will
sometimes
call
munger
for
an
observation
of
buffett
munger
will
offer
one
of
his
classic
remark
such
as
he
take
his
work
seriously
but
he
doesn
t
take
himself
seriously
while
munger
have
excellent
investment
vision
he
suffers
a
problem
with
his
physical
vision
back
in
the
early
s
munger
have
a
cataract
operation
which
go
awry

pain
and
nausea
he
have
his
left
eye
remove
in
the
early
s
and
wear
uncommonly
thick
and
sturdy
black
frame
glass

no
big
handicap
he

say

about
a
book
a
day

a
fair
amount
too
this
voracious

book
as
titan

of

at

underrate
the
importance
of
a
few

marvelous

even
though

lack
the
outward
appearance
of

he
have
a
crew
cut
he
be
work
out
of
a
sun
porch
at

and
his
dietary
leaning

toward
pepsi
salt
nut
and
no

of
their
first
dinner
together
munger
admit

they
also
talk
about

of
thing
the
two
become
fast
friend
and
buffett
kept
tell
him
that
invest
be
a
quicker
way

law
munger
become
convince
and
establish

long
successful

record
himself
even

foot
in
his
law
practice
he
left
his
law
practice
in
somewhere
along
the
line
i
decide
that
i
would
get
rich
not
so
much
for
the
love
of
money
but
for
the
love
of
independence
munger
have
say
i
like
be
able
to
say
what
i
thought
instead
of
what
be
expect
of
me
omaha
world
herald
may
like
warren
i
have
a
considerable
passion
to
get
rich
not
because
i
want
ferraris
i
want
the
independence
i
desperately
want
it
i
thought
it
be
undignified
to
have
to
send
invoice
to
other
people
i
don
t
know
where
i
get
that
notion
from
but
i
have
it
janet
lowe
damn
right
p
from
to
munger
manage
the
investment
firm
of
wheeler
munger
co
from
a
no
frill
office
in
the
pacific
coast
stock
exchange
building
munger
earn
a
highly
respectable
compound
return
of
a
year
before

and
after
expense
forbes
january
munger
have
a
superb
record
from
to
but
be
way
below
the
market
average
in
the
early
s
munger
be
clubbed
in
the
selloff
buffett
have
close
his
partnership
but
subsequently
berkshire
fell
in
the
decline
at
the
end
of
the
wheeler
munger
partnership
have
million
of
which
million
be

in
two

and
new

the
munger

have
about
million
in
the

in
real

after

munger
have
about
million
which
he
later
saw
drop
to
million
he
hung
on
and
at
the
end
of
he
be
back
up
to
million
munger
take
the
money
from
the
partnership
in
the
form
of
blue
chip
and
diversified
which
be
eventually
merge
into
berkshire
and
become
worth
more
than
billion
so
what
persuade
munger
to
switch
from
law
to
invest
i
have
a
huge
family
nancy
and
i
support
eight
child
and
i
didn
t
realize
that
the
law
be
go
to
get
as
prosperous
as
it
suddenly
get
the
big
money
come
into
law
shortly
after
i
left
it
by
i
be
mostly
out
and
i
be
totally
out
by
so
that
be
a
long
time
ago
also
i
prefer
make
decision
and
gamble
my
own
money
i
usually
thought
i
knew
well
than
the
client
anyway
so
why
should
i
have
to
do
it
his
way
so
partly
it
be
have
an
opinionated
personality
and
partly
it
be
a
desire
to
get
resource
permit
independence
also
the
bulk
of
my
client
be
terrific
but
there
be
one
or
two
i
didn
t
enjoy
plus
i
like
the
independence
of
a
capitalist
and
i
always
have
sort
of
a
gamble
personality
i
like
figure
thing
out
and
make
bet
so
i
simply
do
what
come
naturally
outstanding
investor
digest
march
munger
once
say
i
want
to
get
rich
so
i
could
be
independent
and
so
i
could
do
the
thing
like
give
talk
on
the
intersection
of
psychology
and
economics
i
didn

the
story
quote
munger
as
say
one
of
the
thing
you
be
suppose
to
do
when
you
rise
to
a
leadership
position
be
to
be
an
exemplar
and
a
man
who
rise
to
be
an
exemplar
should
not
be
fan
the
flame
of
envy
munger
be
quick
with
quip
and
often
come
up
with
important
common
sense
lesson
of
his
own
for
instance
he
have
say
the
first
chance
you
have
to
avoid
a
loss
from
a
foolish
loan
be
by
refuse
to
make
it
there
be
no
second
chance
munger
and
buffett
work
together
quickly
and
efficiently
and
have
work
together
so
long
each
know
how
the
other
will
view
something
however
the
two
men
do
have
their
different
opinion
munger
be
a
staunch
republican
buffett
be
a
democrat
munger
like
to
fish
in
lake
and
stalk
big
salmon
in
alaskan
river
while
buffett
care
little
about
fishing
otherwise
the
men
agree
on
almost
everything
buffett
have
say
that
if
something
get
by
one
of
them
it
might
get
by
both
because
their
filter
be
similar
buffett
say
charlie
munger
and
i
can
handle
a
four
page
memo
over
the
phone
with
three
grunt
john
train
the
midas
touch
p
charlie
and
i
be
interchangeable
on
business
decision
buffett
have
say
per
train
s
account
distance
impedes
us
not
at
all
we
ve
always
found
a
telephone
to
be
more
productive
than
a
half
day
meeting
buffett
also
say
my
idea
of
a
group
decision
be
to
look
in
the
mirror
over
the
year
however
if
buffett
have
a
hard
time
make
a
decision
munger
be
the
first
person
he
consult
charlie
say
everything
i
do
be
dumb
if
he
say
it
s
really
dumb
i
know
it
be
but
if
he
just
say
it
s
dumb
i
take
that
as
an
affirmative
vote
fortune
july
buffett
told
forbes
october
that
the
three
people
who
most
influence
him
be
his
father
ben
graham
and
munger
he
say
of
his
father
he
taught
me
to
do
nothing
that
could
not
be
put
on
the
front
page
of
a
newspaper
i
have
never
know
a
well
human
than
my
dad
buffett
say
graham
give
him
an
intellectual
framework
for
invest
and
a
temperamental
model
and
the
ability
to
stand
back
and
not
be
influence
by
a
crowd
not
to
be
fearful
if
stock
go
down
as
for
munger
s
influence
buffett
say
charlie
make
me
focus
on
the
merit
of
a
great
business
with
tremendously
grow
earn
power
but
only
when
you
can
be
sure
of
it
not
like
texas
instrument
or
polaroid
where
the
earn
power
be
hypothetical
charlie
doesn
t
have
his
ego
wrap
up
in
the
business
the
way
i
do
but
he
understands
it
perfectly
essentially
we
have
never
have
an
argument
though
occasional
disagreement
munger
return
the
compliment
to
buffett
in
the
same
forbes
story
one
of
the
reason
warren
be
so
cheerful
be
that
he
doesn
t
have
to
remember
his
line
in
other
word
public
buffett
and
private
buffett
be
the
same
forbes
rat
munger
s
net
worth
at
million
in
munger
be
surprised
to
be
on
the
richest
list
and
respond
i
ve
be
associate
with
warren
so
long
i
thought
i
d
be
just
a
footnote
he
add
that
his
life
s
goal
have
be
to
stay
below
the
cutoff
for
the
list
at
wesco
s
annual
meeting
in
munger
say
the
beauty
of
a
great
business
be
that
it
can
stand
some
ruin
he
told
the
story
about
a
mine
that
have
suffer
some
mismanagement
and
end
it
by
say
if
it
won
t
stand
some
mismanagement
it
s
no
mine
for
classic
stock
pick
he
say
that
one
simply
need
to
try
to
find
mispriced
bet
where
you
conclude
through
a
multi
discipline
approach
you
have
an
advantage
i
need
no
more
than
that
he
continued
we
don
t
worry
about
the
fed
we
re
a
net
buyer
of
stock
as
far
ahead
as
we
can
see
he
conclude
by
say
naturally
he
want
to
buy
stock
at
good
price
i
never
want
to
pay
above
intrinsic
value
for
a
stock
with
very
rare
exception
where
someone
like
warren
buffett
be
in
charge
there
be
people
very
few
worth
pay
up
a
bit
to
get
in
with

blair

an
analyst
with

as
say
that
wesco
have

then
one

warren
wouldn
t
be
warren
have
he
not

charlie

one
wag
say
this
warren
warren
he
s
our
man
if
he
can
t
do
it
munger
can
a
prepared
mind
at
berkshire
s
annual
meeting
in
munger
make
an
interest
point
about
the
importance
of
maintain
a
prepared
mind
we
have
this
idea
that
desirable
opportunity
frequently
be
very
ephemeral
so
if
you
get
the
idea
that
for
each
of
us
really
good
investment
opportunity
be
not
go
to
come
along
too
often
and
be
not
go
to
last
too
long
when
they
come
you
ve
get
to
prepare
yourself
to
act
during
this
brief
period
and
that
take
a
prepared
mind
it
s
just
that
simple
academic
economics
munger
give
a
talk
on
october
entitle
academic
economics
strength
and
fault
after
consider
interdisciplinary
need
ok
the
talk
may
sound
like
a
snoozer
but
it
really
wasn
t
at
all
here
be
a
few
clip
as
i
talk
about
strength
and
weakness
in
academic
economics
one
interest
fact
you
be
entitle
to
know
be
that
i
never
take
a
course
in
economics
and
with
this
strike
lack
of
credential
you
may
wonder
why
i
have
the
chutzpah
to
be
up
here
give
this
talk
the
answer
be
i
have
a
black
belt
in
chutzpah
i
be
born
with
it
some
people
like
some
of
the
woman
i
know
have
a
black
belt
in
spending
they
be
born
with
that
but
what
they
give
me
be
a
black
belt
in
chutzpah
well
berkshire
s
whole
record
have
be
achieve
without
pay
one
ounce
of
attention
to
the
efficient
market
theory
in
its
hard
form
and
not
one
ounce
of
attention
to
the
descendant
of
that
idea
which
come
out
of
academic
economics
and
go
into
corporate
finance
and
morph
into
such
obscenity
as
the
capital
asset
pricing
model
which
we
also
paid
no
attention
to
i
think
you
d
have
to
believe
in
the
tooth
fairy
to
believe
that
you
could
easily
outperform
the
market
by
seven
percentage
point
per
annum
just
by
invest
in
high
volatility
stock
finally
with
my
peculiar
history
i
m
also
bold
enough
to
be
here
today
because
at
least
when
i
be
young
i
wasn
t
a
total
klutz
for
one
year
at
the
harvard
law
school
i
be
ranked
second
in
my
group
of
about
a
thousand
and
i
always
figure
that
while
there
be
always
a
lot
of
people
much
smarter
than
i
be
i
didn
t
have
to
hang
back
totally
in
the
think
game
einstein
and
sharon
stone
i
think
that
economist
would
be
way
well
off
if
they
paid
more
attention
to
einstein
and
sharon
stone
well
einstein
be
easy
because
einstein
be
famous
for
say
everything
should
be
make
as
simple
as
possible
but
no
more
simple
now
the
say
be
a
tautology
but
it
s
very
useful
and
some
economist
it
may
have
be
herb
stein
have

munger
s
manifesto
what
be
elementary
worldly
wisdom
munger
ask
well
the
first
rule
be
that
you
can
t
really
know
anything
if
you
just
remember
isolated
fact
and
try
and
bang
em
back
if
the
fact
don
t
hang
together
on
a
latticework
of
theory
you
don
t
have
them
in
a
usable
form
you
ve
get
to
have
model
in
your
head
and
you
ve
get
to
array
your
experience
both
vicarious
and
direct
on
this
latticework
of
model
you
may
have
notice
student
who
just
try
to
remember
and
pound
back
what
be
remember
well
they
fail
in
school
and
in
life
you
ve
get
to
hang
experience
on
a
latticework
of
model
in
your
head
what
be
the
model
well
the
first
rule
be
that
you
ve
get
to
have
multiple
model
because
if
you
just
have
one
or
two
that
you
re
use
the
nature
of
human
psychology
be
such
that
you
ll
torture
reality
so
that
it
fit
your
model
or
at
least
you
ll
think
it
do
you
become
the
equivalent
of
a
chiropractor
who
of
course
be
the
great
boob
in
medicine
worldly
wisdom
come
from
a
work
understand
not
necessarily
advanced
degree
of
math
algebra
geometry
and
understand
the
advantage
of
scale
accounting
engineering
physic
the
notion
of
critical
mass
biology
and
psychology
and
right
up
there
may
need
to
be
an
understand
of
pari
mutual
bet
both
buffett
and
munger
have
stress
the
importance
of
know
math
even
though
there
be
some
woman
say
the
only
thing
math
taught
me
be
how
to
make
partial
payment
in
his
talk
munger
quote
pascal
as
say
the
mind
of
man
at
one
and
the
same
time
be
both
the
glory
and
the
shame
of
the
universe
and
that
s
exactly
right
munger
continued
it
have
this
enormous
power
however
it
also
have
these
standard
misfunctions
that
often
cause
it
to
reach
wrong
conclusion
it
also
make
man
extraordinarily
subject
to
manipulation
by
others
for
example
roughly
half
of
the
army
of
adolf
hitler
be
compose
of
believe
catholic
give
enough
clever
psychological
manipulation
what
human
being
will
do
be
quite
interest
munger
say
let
s
go
through
a
list
albeit
an
incomplete
one
of
possible
advantage
of
scale
some
come
from
simple
geometry
if
you
re
building
a
great
spherical
tank
obviously
as
you
build
it
big
the
amount
of
steel
you
use
in
the
surface
go
up
with
the
square
and
the
cubic
volume
go
up
with
the
cube
so
as
you
increase
the
dimension
you
can
hold
a
lot
more
volume
per
unit
area
of
steel
and
there
be
all
kind
of
thing
like
that
where
the
simple
geometry
the
simple
reality
give
you
an
advantage
of
scale
for
example
you
can
get
advantage
of
scale
from
tv
advertising
when
tv
advertising
first
arrive
when
talk
color
picture
first
come
into
our
living
room
it
be
an
unbelievably
powerful
thing
and
in
the
early
day
we
have
three
network
that
have
whatever
it
be
say
of
the
audience
well
if
you
be
procter
gamble
you
could
afford
to
use
this
new
method
of
advertising
you
could
afford
the
very
expensive
cost
of
network
television
because
you
be
sell
so
many
can
and
bottle
some
little
guy
couldn
t
and
there
be
no
way
of
buying
it
in
part
therefore
he
couldn
t
use
it
in
effect
if
you
didn
t
have
a
big
volume
you
couldn
t
use
network
tv
advertising
which
be
the
most
effective
technique
so
when
tv
come
in
the
brand
company
that
be
already
big
get
a
huge
tail
wind
indeed
they
prosper
and
prosper
and
prosper
until
some
of
them
get
fat
and
foolish
which
happens
with
prosperity
at
least
to
some
people
and
your
advantage
of
scale
can
be
an
informational
advantage
if
i
go
to
some
remote
place
i
may
see
wrigley
chew
gum
alongside
glotz
s
chew
gum
well
i
know
that
wrigley
be
a
satisfactory
product
whereas
i
don
t
know
anything
about
glotz
s
so
if
one
be
cent
and
the
other
be
cent
be
i
go
to
take
something
i
don
t
know
and
put
it
in
my
mouth
which
be
a
pretty
personal
place
after
all
for
a
lousy
dime
so
in
effect
wrigley
simply
by
be
so
well
know
have
advantage
of
scale
what
you
might
call
an
informational
advantage
another
advantage
of
scale
come
from
psychology
the
psychologist
use
the
term
social
proof
we
be
all
influence
subconsciously
and
to
some
extent
consciously
by
what
we
see
others
do
and
approve
therefore
if
everybody
s
buying
something
we
think
it
s
well
we
don
t
like
to
be
the
one
guy
who
s
out
of
step
far
there
s
another
kind
of
advantage
to
scale
in
some
business
the
very
nature
of
thing
be
to
sort
of
cascade
toward
the
overwhelm
dominance
of
one
firm
the
most
obvious
one
be
daily
newspaper
there
s
practically
no
city
left
in
the
u
s
aside
from
a
few
very
big
one
where
there
s
more
than
one
daily
newspaper
and
again
that
s
a
scale
thing
once
i
get
most
of
the
circulation
i
get
most
of
the
advertising
and
once
i
get
most
of
the
advertising
and
circulation
why
would
anyone
want
the
thinner
paper
with
less
information
in
it
so
it
tends
to
cascade
to
a
winner
take
all
situation
and
that
s
a
separate
form
of
the
advantage
of
scale
phenomenon
munger
also
point
out
the
great
defect
of
scale
of
course
which
make
the
game
interest
so
that
the
big
people
don
t
always
win
be
that
as
you
get
big
you
get
the
bureaucracy
and
with
the
bureaucracy
come
the
territoriality
which
be
again
ground
in
human
nature
and
the
incentive
be
perverse
for
example
if
you
work
for
at
t
in
my
day
it
be
a
great
bureaucracy
who
in
the
hell
be
really
think
about
the
shareholder
or
anything
else
and
in
a
bureaucracy
you
think
the
work
be
do
when
it
go
out
of
your
in
basket
into
somebody
else
s
in
basket
but
of
course
it
isn
t
it
s
not
do
until
at
t
delivers
what
it
s
suppose
to
deliver
so
you
get
big
fat
dumb
unmotivated
bureaucracy
understand
what
an
exclusive
franchise
be
or
a
monopoly
like
business
be
essential
to
invest
munger
say
if
you
get
the
franchise
for
the
only
food
stand
in
an
airport
you
have
a
captive
clientele
and
you
have
a
small
monopoly
of
a
sort
the
great
lesson
in
microeconomics
be
to
discriminate
between
when
technology
be
go
to
help
you
and
when
it
s
go
to
kill
you
and
most
people
do
not
get
this
straight
in
their
head
but
a
fellow
like
buffett
do
for
example
when
we
be
in
the
textile
business
which
be
a
terrible
commodity
business
we
be
make
low
end
textile
which
be
a
real
commodity
product
and
one
day
the
people
come
to
warren
and
say
they
ve
invent
a
new
loom
that
we
think
will
do
twice
as
much
work
as
our
old
one
and
warren
say
gee
i
hope
this
doesn
t
work
because
if
it
do
i
m
go
to
close
the
mill
and
he
meant
it
what
be
he
think
he
be
think
it
s
a
lousy
business
we
re
earn
substandard
return
and
keep
it
open
just
to
be
nice
to
the
elderly
worker
but
we
re
not
go
to
put
huge
amount
of
new
capital
into
a
lousy
business
and
he
knew
that
the
huge
productivity
increase
that
would
come
from
a
well
machine
introduce
into
the
production
of
a
commodity
product
would
all
go
to
the
benefit
of
the
buyer
of
the
textile
nothing
be
go
to
stick
to
our
rib
as
owner
that
s
such
an
obvious
concept
that
there
be
all
kind
of
wonderful
new
invention
that
give
you
nothing
as
owner
except
the
opportunity
to
spend
a
lot
more
money
in
a
business
that
s
still
go
to
be
lousy
the
money
still
won
t
come
to
you
all
of
the
advantage
from
great
improvement
be
go
to
flow
through
to
the
customer
stay
in
your
circle
of
competence
munger
say
every
person
be
go
to
have
a
circle
of
competence
and
it
s
go
to
be
very
hard
to
advance
that
circle
if
i
have
to
make
my
living
as
a
musician
i
can
t
even
think
of
a
level
low
enough
to
describe
where
i
would
be
sort
out
to
if
music
be
the
measure
standard
of
the
civilization
so
you
have
to
figure
out
what
your
own
aptitude
be
if
you
play
game
where
other
people
have
the
aptitude
and
you
don
t
you
re
go
to
lose

that
s
as
close
to
certain
as
any
prediction
that
you
can
make
you
have
to
figure
out
where
you

get
an
edge
and
you
ve
get
to
play
within
your
own
circle
of
competence

to

you
may
start

hopeless

if

probably
doable
by
two
third
of
you
it
take
a
will
it
take
the
intelligence
but
after
a
while
you

gradually
know
all
about
the
plumbing
business
in
bemidji
and
master
the
art
that
be
an
attainable
objective

discipline

could
never
win
a
chess
tournament
or
stand
in
center
court
in
a
respectable
tennis
tournament
can
rise
quite
high
in
life
by
slowly
develop
a
circle
of
competence
which
result
partly
from
what
they
be
born
with
and
partly
from
what
they
slowly
develop
through
work
so
some
edge
can
be
acquire

the

some
extent

very

substructure
of
worldly
wisdom
munger
begin
talk
about
invest
plain
vanilla
stock
pick
he
say
the
first
question
be
what
be
the
nature
of
the
stock
market
and
that
get
you
directly
to
this
efficient
market
theory
that
get
to
be
the
rage
a
total
rage
long
after
i
graduate
from
law
school
and
it
s
rather
interest
because
one
of
the
great
economist
of
the
world
be
a
substantial
shareholder
in
berkshire
hathaway
and
have
be
for
a
long
time
his
textbook
always
taught
that
the
stock
market
be
perfectly
efficient
and
that
nobody
could
beat
it
but
his
own
money
go
into
berkshire
and
make
him
wealthy
so
like
pascal
in
his
famous
wager
he
hedge
his
bet
be
the
stock
market
so
efficient
that
people
can
t
beat
it
well
the
efficient
market
theory
be
obviously
roughly
right
meaning
that
market
be
quite
efficient
and
it
s
quite
hard
for
anybody
to
beat
the
market
by
significant
margin
as
a
stock
picker
by
just
be
intelligent
and
work
in
a
discipline
way
indeed
the
average
result
have
to
be
the
average
result
by
definition
everybody
can
t
beat
the
market
as
i
always
say
the
iron
rule
of
life
be
that
only
of
the
people
can
be
in
the
top
fifth
that
s
just
the
way
it
be
so
the
answer
be
that
it
s
partly
efficient
and
partly
inefficient
pari
mutual
bet
not
totally
buying
the
efficient
market
theory
munger
say
the
model
i
like
to
sort
of
simplify
the
notion
of
what
go
on
in
a
market
for
common
stock
be
the
pari
mutual
system
at
the
racetrack
if
you
stop
to
think
about
it
a
pari
mutual
system
be
a
market
everybody
go
there
and
bet
and
the
odds
change
base
on
what
s
bet
that
s
what
happens
in
the
stock
market
any
damn
fool
can
see
that
a
horse
carry
a
light
weight
with
a
wonderful
win
rate
and
a
good
post
position
etc
etc
be
way
more
likely
to
win
than
a
horse
with
a
terrible
record
and
extra
weight
and
so
on
and
so
on
but
if
you
look
at
the
odds
the
bad
horse
pay
to
whereas
the
good
horse
pay
to
then
it
s
not
clear
which
be
statistically
the
best
bet
use
the
mathematics
of
fermat
and
pascal
the
price
have
change
in
such
a
way
that
it
s
very
hard
to
beat
the
system
and
then
the
track
be
take
off
the
top
so
not
only
do
you
have
to
outwit
all
the
other
better
but
you
ve
get
to
outwit
them
by
such
a
big
margin
that
on
average
you
can
afford
to
take
of
your
gross
bet
off
the
top
and
give
it
to
the
house
before
the
rest
of
your
money
can
be
put
to
work
after
play
with
that
thought
for
a
while
munger
pose
a
question
how
do
you
get
to
be
one
of
those
who
be
a
winner
in
a
relative
sense
instead
of
a
loser
he
follow
with
an
interest
observation
the
one
thing
that
all
those
win
better
in
the
whole
history
of
people
who
ve
beaten
the
pari
mutual
system
have
be
quite
simple
they
bet
very
seldom
it
s
not
give
to
human
being
to
have
such
talent
that
they
can
just
know
everything
about
everything
all
the
time
but
it
be
give
to
human
being
who
work
hard
at
it
who
look
and
sift
the
world
for
a
mispriced
bet
that
they
can
occasionally
find
one
and
the
wise
one
bet
heavily
when
the
world
offer
them
that
opportunity
they
bet
big
when
they
have
the
odds
and
the
rest
of
the
time
they
don
t
it
s
just
that
simple
and
yet
in
investment
management
practically
nobody
operates
that
way
we
operate
that
way
i
m
talk
about
buffett
and
munger
and
we
re
not
alone
in
the
world
but
a
huge
majority
of
people
have
some
other
crazy
construct
in
their
head
and
instead
of
wait
for
a
near
cinch
and
load
up
they
apparently
ascribe
to
the
theory
that
if
they
work
a
little
harder
or
hire
more
business
school
student
they
ll
come
to
know
everything
about
everything
all
the
time
to
me
that
s
totally
insane
the
way
to
win
be
to
work
work
work
work
and
hope
to
have
a
few
insight
how
many
insight
do
you
need
well
i
d
argue
that
you
don
t
need
many
in
a
lifetime
if
you
look
at
berkshire
hathaway
and
all
of
its
accumulate
billion
the
top
insight
account
for
most
of
it
and
that
s
with
a
very
brilliant
man
warren
s
a
lot
more
able
than
i
be
and
very
discipline
devote
his
lifetime
to
it
i
don
t
mean
to
say
that
he
s
only
have
insight
i
m
just
say
that
most
of
the
money
come
from
insight
so
you
can
get
very
remarkable
investment
result
if
you
think
more
like
a
win
pari
mutual
player
just
think
of
it
as
a
heavy
odds
against
a
game
full
of
craziness
with
an
occasional
mispriced
something
or
other
and
you
re
probably
not
go
to
be
smart
enough
to
find
thousand
in
a
lifetime
and
when
you
get
a
few
you
really
load
up
it
s
just
that
simple
but
find
those
few
mispriced
option
can
be
very
hard
munger
explain
in
the
stock
market
some
railroad
that
s
beset
by
well
competitor
and
tough
union
may
be
available
at
one
third
of
its
book
value
in
contrast
ibm
in
its
heyday
might
be
sell
at
six
time
book
value
so
it
s
just
like
the
pari
mutual
system
any
damn
fool
could
plainly
see
that
ibm
have
well
business
prospect
than
the
railroad
but
once
you
put
the
price
into
the
formula
it
wasn
t
so
clear
anymore
what
be
go
to
work
best
for
a
buyer
choose
between
the
stock
so
it
s
a
lot
like
a
pari
mutual
system
and
therefore
it
get
very
hard
to
beat
munger
say
to
graham
it
be
a
blessing
to
be
in
business
with
a
manic
depressive
who
give
you
this
series
of
option
all
the
time
that
be
a
very
significant
mental
construct
and
it
s
be
very
useful
to
buffett
for
instance
over
his
whole
adult
lifetime
however
if
we
d
stayed
with
classic
graham
the
way
ben
graham
do
it
we
would
never
have
have
the
record
we
have
and
that
s
because
graham
wasn
t
try
to
do
what
we
do
for
example
graham
didn
t
want
to
ever
talk
to
management
and
his
reason
be
that
like
the
best
sort
of
professor
aim
his
teach
at
a
mass
audience
he
be
try
to
invent
a
system
that
anybody
could
use
and
he
didn
t
feel
that
the
man
in
the
street
could
run
around
and
talk
to
management
and
learn
thing
he
also
have
a
concept
that
the
management
would
often
couch
the
information
very
shrewdly
to
mislead
therefore
it
be
very
difficult
and
that
be
still
true
of
course
human
nature
be
what
it
be
and
so
have
start
out
as
grahamites
which
by
the
way
work
fine
we
gradually
get
what
i
would
call
well
insight
and
we
realize
that
some
company
that
be
sell
at
two
or
three
time
book
value
could
still
be
a
hell
of
a
bargain
because
of
momentum
implicit
in
its
position
sometimes
combine
with
an
unusual
managerial
skill
plainly
present
in
some
individual
or
other
or
some
system
or
other
and
once
we
d
gotten
over
the
hurdle
of
recognize
that
a
thing
could
be
a
bargain
base
on
quantitative
measure
that
would
have
horrify
graham
we
start
think
about
well
business
and
by
the
way
the
bulk
of
the
billion
in
berkshire
hathaway
have
come
from
the
well
business
much
of
the
first
or
million
come
from
scramble
around
with
our
geiger
counter
but
the
great
bulk
of
the
money
have
come
from
the
great
business
munger
say
it
make
sense
to
load
up
on
the
very
few
good
insight
you
have
instead
of
pretend
to
know
everything
about
everything
at
all
time
you
re
much
more
likely
to
do
well
if
you
start
out
to
do
something
feasible
instead
of
something
that
isn
t
feasible
isn
t
that
perfectly
obvious
occasionally
you
ll
find
a
human
be
who
s
so
talented
that
he
can
do
thing
that
ordinary
skilled
mortal
can
t
i
would
argue
that
simon
mark
who
be
second
generation
in
mark
spencer
of
england
be
such
a
man
patterson
be
such
a
man
at
national
cash
register
and
sam
walton
be
such
a
man
these
people
do
come
along
and
in
many
case
they
re
not
all
that
hard
to
identify
if
they
ve
get
a
reasonable
hand
with
the
fanaticism
and
intelligence
and
so
on
that
these
people
generally
bring
to
the
party
then
management
can
matter
much
however
average
out
bet
on
the
quality
of
a
business
be
well
than
bet
on
the
quality
of
management
in
other
word
if
you
have
to
choose
one
bet
on
the
business
momentum
not
the
brilliance
of
the
manager
but
very
rarely
you
find
a
manager
who
s
so
good
that
you
re
wise
to
follow
him
into
what
look
like
a
mediocre
business
finally
i
d
like
to
once
again
talk
about
investment
management
that
be
a
funny
business
because
on
a
net
basis
the
whole
investment
management
business
together
give
no
value
add
to
all
buyer
combine
that
s
the
way
it
have
to
work
of
course
that
isn
t
true
of
plumbing
and
it
isn
t
true
of
medicine
if
you
re
go
to
make
your
career
in
the
investment
management
business
you
face
a
very
peculiar
situation
and
most
investment
manager
handle
it
with
psychological
denial
just
like
a
chiropractor
that
be
the
standard
method
of
handle
the
limitation
of
the
investment
management
process
but
if
you
want
to
live
the
best
sort
of
life
i
would
urge
each
of
you
not
to
use
the
psychological
denial
mode
i
think
a
select
few
a
small
percentage
of
the
investment
manager
can
deliver
value
add
but
i
don
t
think
brilliance
alone
be
enough
to
do
it
i
think
that
you
have
to
have
a
little
of
this
discipline
of
call
your
shot

up

have
become
the
richest
person
in

driven
by
an
insight
that
have
come
to
him
when

he
have
visit
a
collection

tweakmore
also
saw
exactly
how
he
could
create
for
himself
an
operation
that
possess
all
the
characteristic
of

rapidly
because
he
be
very
successful
in
convincing

to
enlarge

be
permissible
indeed
by
the
time
tweakmore

any

so

occur
tweakmore
be
pleased
but
not
satisfied
by
what
he
have
accomplish
and
he
now
plan
to
revolutionize
boneheadia
s
home
mortgage
loan
business
in
a
manner
that
would
make
tweakmore
a
national
hero
in
his
first
proposal
to
wantmore
tweakmore
held
much
of
his
ingenuity
in
reserve
all
he
propose
be
that
wantmore
hereafter
sell
all
his
home
loan
to
tweakmore
at
a
high
price
than
life
insurer
would
pay
tweakmore
say
that
he
plan
to
put
all
loan
into
trust
with
no
other
asset
each
trust
would
be
divide
into
five
tranche
with
different
priority
in
use
of
loan
payment
four
tranche
would
use
their
share
of
loan
payment
to
pay
off
complex
new
fix
interest
bearing
freely
tradable
debt
instrument
call
cdos
the
fifth
tranch
get
a
tiny
residue
in
case
all
home
loan
payment
be
receive
as
due
the
cdos
would
be
sell
by
tweakmore
use
a
highly
paid
sale
force
to
anyone
who
could
be
induced
to
buy
even
highly
leveraged
speculator
and
small
scandinavian
city
in
the
arctic
to
wantmore
tweakmore
s
proposal
at
first
appear
unfeasible
the
plan
operation
seem
to
resemble
the
operation
of
a
meat
vendor
who
routinely
bought
pound
of
chuck
roast
slice
it
up
and
then
sell
pound
as
filet
mignon
and
the
balance
as
dog
food
but
wantmore
s
doubt
melt
away
when
tweakmore
reveal
how
much
he
would
pay
under
the
offer
term
wantmore
would
double
his
income
something
tweakmore
could
easily
afford
because
his
own
income
be
go
to
be
three
time
that
of
wantmore
after
wantmore
accepted
tweakmore
s
proposal
everything
work
out
exactly
as
tweakmore
have
plan
because
buyer
of
cdos
in
aggregate
paid
much
more
than
the
life
insurer
have
formerly
paid
even
so
wantmore
as
he
become
familiar
with
tweakmore
s
prosperity
be
soon
dissatisfied
with
a
merely
double
income
with
wantmore
restive
tweakmore
now
displayed
the
full
range
of
his
ingenuity
what
tweakmore
next
propose
be
that
wantmore
add
to
his
product
line
a
new
class
of
subprime
pay
what
you
wish
home
mortgage
loan
all
loan
would
bear
interest
at
or
more
and
borrower
would
not
be
allow
to
state
anything
except
that
they
want
the
money
there
would
be
no
down
payment
and
no
credit
check
or
the
like
also
each
loan
would
be
very
user
friendly
in
its
first
three
year
during
which
the
borrower
could
make
only
tiny
payment
with
all
unpaid
interest
be
add
to
principal
after
three
year
very
onerous
loan
service
be
require
design
to
pay
off
the
greatly
swollen
principal
plus
all
interest
over
the
next
five
year
this
proposal
would
have
seem
preposterous
even
hilariously
satirical
if
it
have
be
present
to
wantmore
when
tweakmore
have
first
call
but
by
now
wantmore
have
double
his
income
by
go
along
with
a
peculiar
idea
of
tweakmore
s
so
wantmore
s
credulity
be
easily
stretch
to
allow
acceptance
of
the
new
loan
product
which
tweakmore
project
would
triple
wantmore
s
already
double
income
it
be
easy
to
see
why
wantmore
become
a
true
believer
in
the
new
loan
product
but
why
do
the
already
super
rich
prominent
and
sophisticated
tweakmore
believe
his
revise
scheme
would
work
safely
and
well
for
him
well
we
know
the
answer
as
tweakmore
reveal
in
his
prideful
autobiography
his
thought
process
be
as
follow
there
would
be
no
significant
trouble
during
the
first

year
under
the
accounting
standard
of
boneheadia
all
its
accountant
would
be
require
for
a
long
time
to
reserve
no
loan
loss
provision
at
all
against
unpaid
principal
and
unpaid

on
the
new

and
cdos
would
be
value
highly
in
trading
market
because
underlie
loan
be
book
at
unreasonably
high
value
it
wouldn
t
matter
that
homebuyers
be
make
no
down
payment
have
no
personal
liability
at
any
time
and
paid
only
a
tiny
portion
of

accrue
for
three
year
it
also
wouldn

matter
that
any
competent
inquiry

have
reveal
extreme
past
improvidence
on
the
part
of
most
borrower
house
price
in
boneheadia
would
not
merely
rise
as
they
have
do
before
price
would
rise
much
faster
as
more
and
more
people
learn
they
could
bid
to
acquire
home
without
use
any
of
their

no

house

the

than
they
could
get
elsewhere
house
price
in
boneheadia
would
rise
faster
and
faster
as
the
scheme
fed
on
itself
in
a
runaway
feedback
mode
true
after
the
first
three
year
many
over
stretch
homebuyers
be
sure
to
suffer
somewhat
as
they
be
force
by
threat
of
foreclosure
to
sell
their
home
this
would
often
cost
them
their
credit
and
the
respect
of
their
child
friend
and
employer
but
that
would
be
the
only
trouble
and
it
would
prove
endurable
by
tweakmore
and
everyone
else
except
the
people
force
out
of
home
the
runaway
feedback
mode
that
drove
up
house
price
would
cause
no
significant
trouble
for
decade
as
have
happen
in
japan
where
a
big
bust
in
real
estate
price
occur
only
after
the
imperial
palace
ground
in
tokyo
be
apparently
worth
more
than
the
market
value
of
the
entire
state
of
california
the
principle
of
economics
would
give
the
scheme
a
large
tailwind
and
considerable
popularity
as
tweakmore
a
former
student
in
elementary
economics
knew
from
study
galbraith
a
large
undisclosed
embezzlement
strongly
stimulates
spending
because
the
perpetrator
be
much
richer
and
the
victim
spends
as
before
because
he
do
not
yet
feel
poorer
and
what
tweakmore
be
create
be
the
functional
equivalent
of
a
long
run
undisclosed
embezzlement
on
steroid
the
perpetrator
would
not
be
the
only
one
to
depend
more
as
typically
occurs
during
ordinary
embezzlement
the
cdo
buying
victim
also
would
spend
more
as
they
believe
they
be
get
richer
and
richer
from
ever
grow
paper
gain
embody
in
accrual
of
interest
at
above
normal
rate
to
be
sure
the
scheme
look
a
little
like
a
chain
letter
scheme
and
such
scheme
be
usually
ill
regard
by
prospective
user
partly
because
the
scheme
be
criminal
and
partly
because
the
scheme
always
blew
up
so
quickly
bring
criminal
trouble
so
soon
tweakmore
s
scheme
in
contrast
would
by
design
be
lawful
and
benevolent
and
recognize
as
such
because
it
would
create
big
macroeconomic
stimulus
as
a
public
good
and
should
the
scheme
eventually
blow
up
after
decade
like
the
land
price
bubble
in
japan
who
could
fairly
blame
tweakmore
nothing
last
forever
besides
the
blowup
might
be
lose
in
a
miasma
of
other
blowup
like
those
sure
to
come
in
many
irresponsible
country
and
subdivision
of
country
tweakmore
s
revise
scheme
work
fantastically
well
for
a
considerable
period
naturally
there
be
some
glitch
but
tweakmore
turn
each
glitch
into
an
opportunity
to
boost
profit
for
instance
when
wantmore
be
make
nervous
as

of

drawn
into
his

what
you

tweakmore
respond
by

then

optimal
unless
it

soon
increase

his

cause
tweakmore
to
buy
five
additional

business
and
replace
their
ceo
with
people
like
totalscum
cause
profit
to
soar
and
soar
even
though
tweakmore
never
again
found
anyone
else
whose
deprave
operation
could
produce
result
that
match
those
of
totalscum
as
tweakmore
s
scheme
go
on
it
be
necessary
for
its

that
the

hugely
important

that
any
sensible

would

unreliable
however
there
be
almost
no

that

act
otherwise
than
as
tweakmore
desire
the
accountant
of
boneheadia

not

they
have

must
remain
base
on
the
zero

record
that

exist
before

met
tweakmore
and
so
long
as

no

go
to

an

if

he
would
have
to

there
weren

he
never

he

a

make
the

about

they

name
oblivious
be
particularly
approve
he

until
the

s
the

last
only
three
year
he
have

s
strength
and
the
power
of
people
to
understand
in
due
course
super
size
folly
these
factor
have
help
shorten
the

also
boneheadia
have
prove
less
like
japan
than
have
be
hop
when
the
boom
end
bust
come
it
be
a
doozy
almost
every
investment
bank
have
be
make
collapse
prone
by
tweakmore
s
innovation
before
he
become
interested
in
home
loan
and
now
in
a
huge
bust
most
big
financial
institution
be
sure
to
disappear
cause
total
chaos
and
another
great
depression
unless
there
be
super
massive
intervention
by
the
government
finance
by
printing
money
fortunately
boneheadia
do
so
intervene
guide
by
effective
leader
who
somehow
obtain
support
from
politician
in
both
political
party
and
after
this
massive
intervention
boneheadia
with
double
unemployment
be
enormously
bad
off
than
if
the
boom
and
bust
have
never
happen
and
its
option
in
case
of
future
trouble
be
greatly
reduce
because
after
its
money
printing
spree
it
be
nearer
to
face
general
distrust
of
its
money
and

boneheadia
s
bust
be
now
call
the

yet
even
so
not
much
have
be
learn
by
the
elite
in
boneheadia
among
the
protagonist
and
too
passive
type
who
contribute
so
much
to
the
mess
only
one
have
express
significant
contrition
to
his
great
credit
oblivious
have
recognize
that
he
be
grossly
wrong
the
accounting
profession
remains
unaware
of
its
large
contribution
to
public
woe
and
it
do
not
recognize
the
cognitive
defect
of

which
be
still
believe
to
be
virtuous
quality
that
reduce

their

the

can
be
magnify

have
massive
macroeconomic
consequence
when
the

turnout
prompt
him
to
ask
two
question
what
the
hell
be
go
on
here
and
why
do
it
happen
of
all
the
annual
meeting
for
corporation
the
berkshire
meeting
alone
offer
a
brand
new
dimension
of
festival
intellectual
inquiry
friend
encounter
and
discount
shopping
rank
above
all
the
other
offering
he
add
be
a
common
value
system
adore
by
the
group
he
say
a
central
ethos
have
arisen
part
of
it
be
an
effort
to
be
rational
and
part
be
out
of
disgust
with
scandal
at
other
corporation
not
only
that
munger
add
i
don
t
think
it
would
happen
if
warren
and
i
didn
t
have
a
significant
wiseass
streak
munger
go
on
to
say
that
the
wesco
meeting
draw
the
hard
core
nutcase
attract
to
such
view
that
market
be
not
always
efficient
that
diversification
be
not
always
helpful
and
that
beta
and
modern
portfolio
theory
offer
no
real
help
and
in
fact
be
a
hindrance
munger
say
that
this
particular
time
be
the
most
extreme
period
for
hold
cash
and
with
berkshire
s
huge
hoard
of
cash
and
billion
of
bond
it
doesn
t
want
to
own
berkshire
have
about
billion
in
available
fund
we
don
t
believe
that
market
be
totally
efficient
and
we
don
t
believe
that
widespread
diversification
will
yield
a
good
result
munger
say
we
believe
almost
all
good
investment
will
involve
relatively
low
diversification
if
you
take
the
top
decision
out
we
d
have
a
pretty
average
record
it
wasn
t
hyperactivity
but
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
patience
you
stick
to
your
priority
and
when
opportunity
come
along
you
pounce
on
them
with
vigor
maybe
of
people
will
come
to
our
corner
of
the
tent
and
will
believe
what
they
ve
be
told
that
market
be
totally
efficient
investment
success
he
say
come
partly
from
the
proper
temperament
most
people
be
too
fretful
they
worry
too
much
success
mean
be
very
patient
but
aggressive
when
it
s
time
and
the
more
hard
lesson
you
learn
vicariously
rather
than
through
your
own
hard
experience
the
well
i
don
t
know
anyone
who
become
a
well
investor
with
great
rapidity
warren
have
gotten
to
be
one
hell
of
a
well
investor
over
the
period
i
have
know
him
so
have
i
so
the
game
be
to
keep
learn
you
gotta
like
the
learn
process

seamless
web
of
deserve
trust
at
wesco
s
annual
meeting
in
attend
by
approximately
people
munger
say
what
one
should
want
from
society
be
a
seamless
web
of
deserve
trust
that
be
what
work
best
for
society
for
a
corporation
or
for
a
football
team
thing
work
more
efficiently
if
everyone
operates
in
an
atmosphere
of
trust
he
cite
the
japanese
as
work
together
to
build
their
country
s
prosperity
japan
learn
it
from
us
munger
say
then
add
that
japan
proceed
to
beat
our
brain
out
the
follow
be
some
of
the
many
good
point
that
munger
make
at
the
meeting
he
decry
the
overabundance
of
hedge
fund
say
his
guess
be
that
perhaps
of
gross
domestic
product
gdp
be
go
to
run
hedge
fund
trading
cost
and
the
sale
of
financial
product
such
as
annuity
it
s
not
an
intelligent
allocation
of
brainpower
he
say
china
he
say
be
make
tremendous
stride
as
the
talent
there
be
be
freed
up
with
a
well
political
system
most
asian
be
obsess
with
educate
their
child
for
social
security
to
put
money
in
the
stock
market
in
private
account
be
not
a
good
idea
investor
should
low
the
bar
for
expect
return
he
praise
wal
mart
for
its
dominant
franchise
he
say
over
the
long
term
the
eclipse
rate
of
great
civilization
be
ge
s
jack
welch
be
probably
underpaid
but
that
do
not
necessarily
mean
he
approve
of
welch
s
pay
add
that
if
a
person
rise
in
a
corporation
that
person
should
be
an
exemplar
leader
should
deliberately
take
less
than
they
deserve
that
be
something
never
mention
in

of

offer
these
observation

national
scandal

a
reason
why
it

the
guy
have
a
way
of
pick
out

for

on
the
great
recession
what
we
just
go
through
be
deadly
serious
we
be
on
the
edge
of
something
that
could
have
take
civilization
as
we
know
it
to
the
edge
of
ruin
if
the
government
have
not
step
in
the
whole
damn
thing
would
have
go
down
like
pin
in
a
bowling
alley
who
to
blame
the
academic
elite
fail
us
with
their
utterly
asinine
idea
of
risk
control
very
high
iq
people
can
be
completely
useless
and
many
of
them
be
goldman
sachs
goldman
have
the
best
morality
of
any
of
the
big
bank
from
this
sense
it
s
a
little
crazy
to
be
attack
our
best
bank
i
don
t
think
the
government
do
this
to
be
asinine
but
i
don
t
think
how
they
ve
handle
it
have
be
an
appropriate
response
finance
as
a
career
a
big
percentage
of
cal
tech
grad
be
go
into
finance
i
regard
this
as
a
regretfully
bad
outcome
they
ll
make
a
lot
of
money
clobber
customer
who
aren
t
as
smart
as
them
it
s
a
mistake
i
look
at
this
in
term
of
loss
from
the
diversion
of
our
best
talent
go
into
some
money
grub
exercise
on
jpmorgan
chase
jamie
dimon
be
a
fine
and
admirable
man
but
the
world
would
be
well
off
if
jp
morgan
didn
t
run
a
gamble
casino
alongside
a
legitimate
business
i
take
my
hat
off
to
dimon
but
i
d
take
away
his
derivative
book
in
a
second
success
of
berkshire
there
be
two
main
reason
berkshire
have
succeed
one
be
its
decentralization
of
the
unit
we
ve
instal
decentralization
almost
to
the
point
of
abdication
the
other
reason
be
our
extreme
centralization
of
capital
deployment
our
centralization
be
just
as
extreme
as
our
decentralization
munger
say
wesco
an
historical
accident
could
one
day
be
merge
into
berkshire

a
morning
with
charlie
indeed
the
remain
of
the
wesco
share
not
already
own
by
berkshire
be
slat
to
be
bought
by
berkshire
for
about
million
or
a
share
with
both
berkshire
b
stock
and
cash
the
deal
be
finalize
in
june
instead
of
a
wesco
annual
meeting
in
munger
say
he
plan
to
hold
an
afternoon
with
charlie

to
be
drinking
champagne
and
make
plan
to
renovate
the
town
s
era
city
hall
so
the
big
question
be
this
be
munger
wrong
not
to
throw
all
his
money
at
franklin
memorabilia
the
answer
be
no
and
here
be
why
the
original
cost
of
the
edition
be
five
penny
accord
to
james
green
librarian
at
the

company
of

which
be
found
by
franklin
himself
in
green
be
the
coauthor
of
benjamin
franklin
writer
and
printer
so
at
what
rate
must
the
original
price
be
compound
to
turn
five
cent
into
over
year
well
that
one
be
beyond
the
paygrade
of
yours
truly
so
the
question
be
turn
over
to
berkshire
shareholder
richard
hoe
who
calculate
it
to
be
a
return
of
annually
therefore
munger
be
right
to
pas
on
the
book
and
be
right
to
wait
two
and
a
half
century
for
the
dawn
of
the
woodstock
era
at
berkshire
before
invest
remember
the
old
joke
about

he
thought
he

then
checked

he

letter

buffett
s
address
to
stockholder
in
the
annual

as

you
be
naturally
concerned
about
whether
i
will
insist
on
continue
as
ceo
after
i
begin
to
fade
and
if
so
how
the
board
will
handle
that
problem
you
also
want
to
know
what
happens
if
i
should
die
tonight
that
second
question
be
easy
to
answer
most
of
our
many
business
have
strong
market
position
significant
momentum
and
terrific
manager
the
special

deeply
ingrain
through
our
subsidiary
and
these
operation
won
t
miss
a
beat
when
i
die
moreover
we
have
three
manager
at
berkshire
who
be
reasonably
young
and
fully
capable
of
be
ceo
any
of
the
three
would
be
much
well
at
certain
management
aspect
of
my
job
than
i
on
the
minus
side
none
have
my
crossover
experience
that
allows
me
to
be
comfortable
make
decision
in
either
the
business
arena
or
in
investment
that
problem
will
be
solve
by
have
another
person
in
the
organization
handle
marketable
security
that
s
an
interest
job
at
berkshire
and
the
new
ceo
will
have
no
problem
in
hire
a
talented
individual
to
do
it
indeed
that
s
what
we
have
do
at
geico
for
year
and
our
result
have
be
terrific
berkshire
s
board
have
fully
discuss
each
of
the
three
ceo
candidate
and
have
unanimously
agree
on
the
person
who
should
succeed
me
if
a
replacement
be
need
today
the
director
stay
update
on
this
subject
and
could
alter
their
view
as
circumstance
change
new
managerial
star
may
emerge
and
present
one
will
age
the
important
point
be
that
the
director
know
now
and
will
always
know
in
the
future
exactly
what
they
will
do
when
the
need
arises
the
other
question
that
must
be
address
be
whether
the
board
will
be
prepared
to
make
a
change
if
that
need
should
arise
not
from
my
death
but
rather
from
my
decay
particularly
if
this
decay
be
accompany
by
my
delusionally
think
that
i
be
reach
new
peak
of
managerial
brilliance
that
problem
would
not
be
unique
to
me
charlie
and
i
have
face
this
situation
from
time
to
time
at
berkshire
s
subsidiary
human
age
at
greatly
vary
rate
but
sooner
or
later
their
talent
and
vigor
decline
some
manager
remain
effective
well
into
their
s
charlie
be
a
wonder
at
and
others
noticeably
fade
in
their
s
when
their
ability
ebb
so
usually
do
their
power
of
self
assessment
someone
else
often
need
to
blow
the
whistle
when
that
time
come
for
me
our
board
will
have
to
step
up
to
the
job
from
a
financial
standpoint
its
member
be
unusually
motivate
to
do
so
i
know
of
no
other
board
in
the
country
in
which
the
financial
interest
of
director
be
so
completely
align
with
those
of
shareholder
few
board
even
come
close
on
a
personal
level
however
it
be
extraordinarily
difficult
for
most
people
to
tell
someone
particularly
a
friend
that
he
or
she
be
no
longer
capable
if
i
become
a
candidate
for
that
message
however
our
board
will
be
do
me
a
favor
by
deliver
it
every
share
of
berkshire
that
i
own
be
destine
to
go
to
philanthropy
and
i
want
society
to
reap
the
maximum
good
from
these
gift
and
bequest
it
would
be
a
tragedy
if
the
philanthropic
potential
of
my
holding
be
diminish
because
my
associate
shirk
their
responsibility
to
tenderly
i
hope
show
me
the
door
but
don
t
worry
about
this
we
have
an
outstanding
group
of
director
and
they
will
always
do
what
s
right
for
the
shareholder
apparently
the
next
hand
picked
ceo
do
not
know
he
or
she
be
the
selection
that
give

to

young

to
reach
his

weschler
offer
to

but
buffett
say
you
already
have
omaha
world
herald
september
and
later
told
the

september
he
s
our
kind
of

berkshire
first
at

buffett
ask
weschler
about
the
possibility
of
join

i
very
much
want
him
to

i
didn

expect
to
get
very
far
with
the
idea
buffett
told
loomis
ted
will
no
doubt
make

money
with

fund
you
can
get
an
idea
of
that
from
the
size
of

a
reason
to

this

warren
buffett
i
just
want
to
make
clear
an
earlier
question
that
i
think
this
be
a
terrible
deal
frankly
i
own
over
share
and
i
think
considerably
more
money
would
be
realize
in
liquidation
than
will
be
the
situation
if
this
deal
go
through
i
think
the
stock
will
sell
at
a
discount
to
asset
value
with
apollo
in
a
control
position
and
i
intend
to
vote
against
it
i
hope
there
be
a
proposition
put
forward
to
liquidate
the
company
where
significantly
more
value
can
be
realize
and
one
reason
a
compete
bid
isn
t
brought
in
of
course
be
because
of
a
breakup
fee
and
all
that
entail
so
the
simple
way
to
avoid
that
be
to
simply
vote
the
transaction
down
and
then
have
a
proposal
for
liquidation
which
can
be
do
under
the
present
management
or
do
under
a
new
group
of
manager
so
it
s
not

in

with
nbc
s
tom
brokaw
that
his
taxable

be
million
in
although
difficult
to
calculate
such
a
large
number
almost
certainly
have
to
indicate
a
large
personal
portfolio
some
of
it
most
certainly
be
from
capital
gain
and
some
be
probably
from
dividend
his
berkshire
salary
and
board
payment
would
hardly
add
much
to
the
figure
if
the
entire
portfolio
simply
paid
a
dividend
that
would
suggest
a
portfolio
approach
a
billion
still
the
amount
could
be
skewed
by
non
taxable
municipal
bond
or
a
one
time
exceptionally
large
capital
gain
even
so
to
earn
a
capital
gain
of
that
amount
normally
would
require
a
large
amount
of
money
buffett
release
his
taxable
income
number
to
bolster
his
view
about
tax
inequity
say
he
paid
in
tax
far
less
than
the
tax
of
employee
at
berkshire
whose
tax
rate
average
on

range
from
to

in

though

be
normal
in
appearance
it
be
anything
but
the

your

shamelessly
exploit
his
ownership

take
the
mound
but
this
year
you
will
see
something
new
in
the
past
game
much
to
the
bafflement
of
the
crowd
i
have
shaken
off
the
catcher
s
first
call
he
have
consistently
ask
for
my
sweep
curve
and
i
have
just
as
regularly
resist
instead
i
have
serve
up
a
pathetic
fast
ball
which
on
my
best
day
be
clocked
at
eight
mile
per
hour
with
a
follow
wind
there
s
a
story
behind
my
unwillingness
to
throw
the
curve
ball
as
some
of
you
may
know
candy
cummings
invent
the
curve
in
and
use
it
to
great
effect
in
the
national
association
where
he
never
won
less
than
game
in
a
season
the
pitch
however
drew
immediate
criticism
from
the
very
high
of
authority
namely
charles
elliott
then
president
of
harvard
university
who
declare
i
have
heard
that
this
year
we
at
harvard
won
the
baseball
championship
because
we
have
a
pitcher
who
have
a
fine
curve
ball
i
be
far
instruct
that
the
purpose
of
the
curve
ball
be
to
deliberately
deceive
the
batter
harvard
be
not
in
the
business
of
teach
deception
i
m
not
make
this
up
ever
since
i
learn
of
president
elliott
s
moral
teaching
on
this
subject
i
have
scrupulously
refrain
from
use
my
curve
however
devastate
its
effect
might
have
be
on
hapless
batter
now
however
it
be
time
for
my
karma
to
run
over
elliott
s
dogma
and
for
me
to
quit
hold
back
visit
the
park
on
saturday
night
and
marvel
at
the
majestic
arc
of

introduce
my

it
s
a
real
source
of
irritation
to
me
that
many
view
our
annual
meeting
as
a
financial
event
rather
than

the

what

simply
the

question
whether

an
appropriate
multiple
to

the

twelve

approximately
time
after

generally
be
consider
a
fair
multiple
for
the
high
quality
business
that
berkshire
control
this
multiple
also
appear
to
be
consistent
with
several
comment
on

throughout
the

the

both
much

from
what
it
be

as
charlie
and
i
see
it
more
appropriate
the

contain
the

consequently
buffett

somehow
kept

be
now
head
back
down
to
approach
its
intrinsic

the
theoretical
way
to
figure
a

s

be
by
use
john

method
which
discount
future

this
be
tough
because
so
many
variable
and

exist
in

cash

depend
on

and
other
real

factor
thing
that
be
hard
to
quantify
until
after
the
fact
it
s
an
imprecise
science
and
even
inspector
clouseau
himself
couldn
t
come
close
to
this
calculation
with
certainty
some
say
a
no
brainer
way
to
get
at
berkshire
s
intrinsic
value
be
simply
to
take
the
total
asset
show
on
the
balance
sheet
with
no
adjustment
per

by
ignore
float
and
heavily
discounting
the
defer
tax
liability
the
liability
left
over
roughly
correspond
to
the
asset
value
of
the
future
float
growth
so
here
we
go
as
of
december
with
asset
of
about
billion
and
about
million
share
outstanding
berkshire
s
per

intrinsic
value
may
have
be
about
about
less
than
its
stock
price
by
the
end
of
berkshire
s
asset
be
about
billion
suggest
a
per
share
intrinsic
value
of
close
to
less
than
year
end
stock
price
but
a
look
at
result
reveals
a
turnaround
asset
at
year
end
be
about
billion
use
this
no
brainer
method
of
calculate
intrinsic
value
per
share
for
the
approximately
million
equivalent
class
a
share
outstanding
this
asset
amount
would
tally
out
to
a
per

value
a
premium
to
the
year
end
stock
price
this
result
may
be
why
some
berkshire
pro
be
say
in
that
day
the
stock
be
worth
more
than
per

some
say
another
simple
route
to
berkshire
s
intrinsic
value
be
to
multiply
x
berkshire
s
book

about

a

the

as
compare
with
the
closing

in

he
and

wouldn

take
a
big

the

the

the

conclude
berkshire

so
in
my

you
gotta
be
dumber

that

charlie

i
do
not
at
that

he

since
i
set
down
those
caution
berkshire

very
significantly

the

underperformed

today

relationship
be
both
much
different
from
what
it
be

and
as
charlie
and
i
see
it
more
appropriate
in
buffett
speak
that
s
probably
a

june

in
our
look

and
in
that

we
set
a
goal
of
raise
them
by
an
average
of
per
annum
to
billion
in
the

since
that
time
however
we
have
issue
additional
share
include
the
b

recently
so
that
we
now
need
look
through

in
to
match
the
per

goal
we
originally
be
shoot
for
this
be
a
tough
target
but
one
we
still
hope
to
hit
shareholder
and
wall
streeters
often
take
stab
at
berkshire
s
intrinsic
worth
and
always
the
question
be
pose
to
buffett
at
annual
meeting
he
usually
sidestep
the
valuation
question
by
explain
that
he
doesn
t
want
to
spoil
the
fun
for
shareholder
who
want
to
figure
it
out
themselves
some
say
it
s
not
unreasonable
if
berkshire
be
to
trade
at
twice
its
book
value
so
if
berkshire
have
a
book
value
of
a

at
the
end
of
the
price
could
have
be

buyer
and
seller
generally
have
set
a
pretty
fair
value
price
on
berkshire
stock
buffett
have
say
that
he
want
berkshire
to
trade
near
its
intrinsic
value
or
real
business
value
in
the
real
world
rather
than
at
some
inflate
or
depressed
level
he
add
that
reasonable
businessmen
might
value
berkshire
high
or
low
than
its
intrinsic
worth
for
instance
he
and
munger
might
differ
by
about
berkshire
s
intrinsic
value
it
s
doubtful
that
even
buffett
carry
around
in
his
head
a
precise
figure
for
berkshire
s
worth
although
everyone
would
sure
love
to
know
his
estimate
sometimes
buffett
take
this
tack
well
add
it
all
up
and
then
subtract
something
because
i
m
run
it
anyone
can
see
you
should
tally
it
up
and
add
something
for
buffett
s
gray
matter
do
anyone
want
to
calculate
the
munger
premium
in
the
stock
some
people
write
up
berkshire
and
after
add
it
all
up
they
subtract
a
huge
number
because
berkshire
own
big
stake
in
coke
and
gillette
presumably
the
argument
be
that
the
coke
and
gillette
p
e
be
too
high
forbes
columnist
martin
sosnoff
who
have
on
several
occasion
write
that
berkshire
glory
day
be
on
the
wane
offer
a
unique
reason
for
not
buying
berkshire
stock
in
a
piece
write
on
january
he
suggest
that
buying
into
berkshire
be
risky
because
congress
be
unlikely
to
cut
the
capital
gain
tax
rate
as
note
earlier
occasionally
buffett
offer
little
nudge
when
the
price
get
out
of
whack
he
do
so
after
the
stock
soar
to
more
than
a
share
follow
the
excitement
over
berkshire
s
stake
in
cap
city
in
he
indicate
the
stock
price
be
too
high
he
again
indicate
that
berkshire
s
stock
price
too
high
in
late
when
it
soar
to
that
s
when
he
issue
zero
coupon
convertible
bond
tie
to
berkshire
s
stock
price
because
buyer
of
berkshire
s
convertible
have
a
right
to
convert
into
berkshire
stock
and
because
buffett
do
not
easily
issue
new
stock
the
issuance
at
that
time
be
probably
a
sign
that
he
believe
berkshire
to
be
overvalue
he
be
right
for
about
the
next
two
and
a
half
year
berkshire
stock
apparently
overprice
go
nowhere
a
barron
s
piece
february
which
set
forth
the
proposition
that
berkshire
be
overprice
prompt
buffett
to
say
that
he
do
not
necessarily
disagree
with
the
conclusion
just
with
some
of
the
calculation
employ
to
reach
that
conclusion
besides
tell
shareholder
buffett
also
told
usa
today
that
the
barron
s
piece
mistakenly
undervalue
some
of
berkshire
s
holding
there
s
a
mathematical
error
in
their
number
he
say
the
figure
be
wrong
berkshire
be
then
off
its
high
trading
at
about
a

at
the
time
and
the
story
have
sent
the
stock
down
in
a
single
day
the
writer
thomas
n
cochran
conclude
that
berkshire
be
worth
only
about
a
share
and
that
the

price
be
a

fire
off

which
chose
to
publish

gaye

cochran
poor
thomas

cochran
he
apparently
wouldn
t
be
able
to
tell
the
difference
in
value
between
a
lump
of
coal
and
a
diamond
because
they
share
a
similar
structure
one
problem
with
the
barron
s
story
be
that
it
assign
the
common
stock
market
value
to
berkshire
s
prefer
stock
holding
as
if
the
prefer
could
decrease
in
value
like
common
stock
it
be
true
that
the
stock
price
of
three
of
the
four
prefer
stock
investment
be
down
sharply
however
buffett
explain
to
shareholder
that
berkshire
didn
t
own
the
common
stock
of
these
company
that
have
take
a
beating
berkshire
instead
own
the
prefer
stock
which
have
always
continued
to
earn
dividend
of
about
tax
advantage
at
that
there
s
little
chance
that
the
prefer
could
drop
in
value
like
the
common
because
the
prefer
stock
can
be
redeem
for
the
original
face
value
short
of
bankruptcy
which
be
roughly
the
same
amount
buffett
paid
so
there
be
no
loss
although
later
us
airway
be
do
so
poorly
that
it
temporarily
suspend
dividend
payment
and
buffett
write
down
that
investment
on
the
balance

with
the
conversion
privilege
these

may
be
right
that

i
ll
do
what
i
do
in
when
you
come
to
the

conclusion
hold
on
to

and
worry
more
about
the
other
stuff
in
my

kansa
city
lawyer
michael
rhodes
told
his

he
thought
most

might
like
the

work
for

maybe
we

ask
about

at

that
year
you
d
think
buffett
would
be
tempt
to
say
something
to
cochran

buffett
ever
the

dismiss
it

i
d
calculate
it
apparently
he
forgot
we

then
buffett
launch
into

about

on
what

only
on
what
you
understand
about

understand
the

a
challenge
the

to

by

be

buffett
at

that
doesn

it
just

hard
to
ass
although
it
might
have
a
big
effect
on
the
valuation
of
berkshire
than
see
s
candy
or
world
book
talk
about
understatement
he
add
how
the
insurance
table
in
our
annual
report
develops
over
the
next
year
will
be
a
major
factor
in
what
the
intrinsic
value
of
berkshire
be
today
the
source
of
intrinsic
value
of
the
insurance
business
be
the
ability
to
generate
fund
at
a
low
cost
that
s
what
creates
value
if
you
can
figure
out
how
that
table
will
look
in
the
next
year
you
ll
have
a
good
handle
on
our
future
we
think
there
be
significant
potential
in
it
in
term
of
dollar
we
think
that
it
s
big
than
that
of
our
other
directly
own
business
in
the
first
barron
s
article
cochran
assign
a
p
e
of
just
to
berkshire
s
operating
business
at
a
time
when
the
market
p
e
be
in
the
second
story
he
say
berkshire
s
operating
business
be
worth
billion
probably
off
by
a
factor
of
or
ask
buffett
if
he
ll
sell
see
s
the
buffalo
news
or
world
book
for
time
earnings
and
see
how
long
he
stay
on
the
phone
cochran
use
an
old
earnings
figure
in
the
first
story
but
if
it
have
be
the
late
berkshire
s
earnings
would
have
already
plow
ahead
if
you
talk
about
berkshire
from
its
late
report
you
re
probably
million
of
dollar
behind
the
time
for
one
thing
you
d
be
look
backwards
at
lesser
number
because
buffett
report
as
late
as
possible
about
day
after
the
quarter
have
end
you
re
even
farther
behind
if
you
re
cite
figure
from
the
annual
report
that
come
out
in
march
and
reflect
financial
position
and
performance
prior
to
december
also
at
the
time
of
cochran
s
story
the
market
be
decline
therefore
berkshire
s
tab
for
defer
capital
gain
tax
should
have
be
low
than
the
figure
cochran
use
and
be
defer
capital
gain
tax
really
a
liability
as
cochran
imply
if
buffett
sell
everything
he
would
have
to
pay
uncle
sam
a
very
large
tax
bill
there
be
no
question
about
that
however
buffett
tell
us
he
s
not
sell
everything
today
in
fact
he
may
hold
some
investment
forever
also
the
defer
tax
liability
be
non
interest
bearing
and
have
no
redemption
date
if
it
be
a
bond
it
might
be
sell
for
cent
on
the
dollar
in
the
head
of
sequoia
fund
bill
ruane
make
a
point
about
berkshire
s
worth
and
the
tax
question
take
its
current
book
value
which
at
the
end
of
the
year
be
and
that
s
after
a
reserve
for
tax
of
about
or
if
you
add
that
back
and
i
m
not
say
that
you
should
add
it
back
fully
but
the
prospect
of
those
tax
be
paid
in
the
near
future
be
low
so
that
money
s
really
work
for
you
even
though
it
s
not
show
in
the
book
value
he
say
berkshire
be
sell
for
a
below
market
price
to
book
ratio
add
that
many
of
berkshire
s
asset
be
undervalue
on
the
balance
sheet
with
berkshire
he
say
you
re
get
the
fine
security
analyst
in
the
world
cochran
make
no
mention
of
berkshire
s
substantial
look
through
earnings
look
through

be
intrinsic
earnings
that
include
important
unrecorded
earnings
not
include
on
berkshire
s

statement
these
invisible
unrecorded
earnings
be
in
a
sense
berkshire
s
proportionate
ownership
of
the
retain
operating
earnings
of
berkshire
s
major
investees
but
under
generally
accepted
accounting
principle
they
be
not
count
in
berkshire
s

per

coke
for
example
earns
more
than
billion
a

and
berkshire

accounting
rule
keep
berkshire
from
include
its

of

s

on
its

statement
berkshire
s
look
through
earnings
be
presumably
reflect
in
the
stock
price
of
the
corporation
in
which
berkshire
invests
and
hence
be
include
on
berkshire
s
balance
sheet
even
if
they
be
not
on
berkshire
s
income
statement
it
s
a
common
mistake
to
dismiss
berkshire
as
an
overvalue
close
end
fund
but
as
wallace
gaye
once
say
do
you
know
any
close
end
fund
that
internally
generates
its
own
fund
for
investment
berkshire
be
an
ongoing
enterprise
that
invests
well
and
borrows
more
cheaply
than
most
company
the
company
s
value
cannot
be
measure
by
number
alone
witness
the
large
stock
holding
berkshire
s
command
stock
position
offer
an
extra
kicker
some
suggest
attach
a
premium
for
the
huge
stock
position
many
of
berkshire
s
stock
position
be
so
large
that
they
be
prize
for
their
semi
control
nature
such
huge
position
have
the
disadvantage
of
be
less
liquid
than
a
small
position
but
overall
that
provide
an
advantage
because
their
size
offer
more
influence
over
company
performance
witness
the
buyout
of
geico
and
the
management
shakeup
at
salomon
coke
and
gillette
the
future
compound
of
dividend
from
berkshire
s
investees
could
be
another
fountain
of
enormous
value
berkshire
have
other
beauty
as
well
consider
how
buffett
have
structure
the
debt
he
s
pay
regular
interest
rate
on
berkshire
s
debt
and
he
have
very
little
debt
compare
to
equity
berkshire
s
float
with
the
buyout
of
geico
become
about
billion
with
general
re
it
become
about
billion
and
in
be
approach
billion
buffett
himself
paid
billion
for
slightly
less
than
half
of
geico
and
then
write
in
the
annual
report
that
geico
double
berkshire
s
grow
insurance
business
not
only
that
but
because
of
the
huge
capital
of
the
insurance
business
berkshire
enjoys
the
capacity
to
write
business
at
any
time
propitious
to
berkshire
he
say
there
be
a
hidden
potential
to
write
huge
business
in
the
future
a
berkshire
stockholder
add
and
the
fact
that
the
insurance
business
have
grown
over
the
year
the
fact
that
he
can
get
to
this
position
be
indicative
of
the
strength
of
the
insurance
business
we
now
come
back
to
the
original
question
what
be
berkshire
really
worth
add
the
worth
of
the
stock
and
bond
be
easy
enough
even
fun
figure
that
the
coke
investment
be
worth
about
billion
we
won
t
even
consider
whether
the
ocean
of
coke
stock
would
sell
at
an
even
great
premium
be
it
sell
as
a
block
to
a
rich
megalomaniac
or
to
opec
with
respect
to
berkshire
s
operating
business
you
should
be
able
to
put
time
earnings
on
them
to
estimate
their
worth
berkshire
s
group
of
business
apparently
have
among
the
high
return
on
equity
of
any
group
of
business
that
s
a
high
return
on
equity
with
practically
no
debt
so
let
s
loosen
up
a
little
and
put
a
healthy
p
e
on
thing
in
the
schott
letter
write
by
dr
john
schott
figure
berkshire
be
worth
a
share
and
in
it
say
it
be
worth
more
than
at
the
annual
meeting
in
when
berkshire
be
trading
at
buffett
say
the
stock
price
relative
to
its

as
much

or
more
than
the

i
see
floyd
jones
head
of

berkshire

basically
by

at
about
time

over
the

geico

an

then
so
do
berkshire
he
say
in

berkshire

at

buffett

although

therefore
the

it

so
at

there
s

at

time
a

today
with

about
it
appear
to

and
probably
at
a
discount
clearly
buffett
alive
be
valuable
far
beyond
his

managerial
ability
he

naked
through

i
don

s
announcement
that
it
would
buy
general
re
and
with
berkshire
trading
toward
buffett
be
ask
about
the
relationship
of
price
to
intrinsic
value
he
reply
there
s
no
question
that
to
date
this
year
obviously
the
price
of
berkshire
stock
have
outstrip
the
gain
in
intrinsic
value
there
s
no
way
we
could
have
increase
the
percentage
value
at
the
same
percentage
rate
but
i
can
tell
you
also
that
no
member
of
my
family
or
any
of
the
management
of
berkshire
that
i
know
of
have
sell
a
share
and
we
all
think
that
it
s
a
fine
investment
for
a
five
or
year
period
and
that
s
the
way
we
think
about
it
historically
i
think
if
you
look
back
we
think
a
good
bit
of
the
time
berkshire
s
be
undervalue
because
many
people
have
look
at
it
on
the
basis
of
liquidate
value
as
they
might
have
look
at
a
close
end
investment
company
and
frankly
they
be
make
a
mistake
if
they
be
look
at
it
that
way
because
it
be
an
enterprise
that
use
capital
to
try
to
create
more
value
over
the
year
and
in
most
case
it
work
out
ok
so
that
our
intrinsic
value
have
grown
at
a
far
faster
rate
than
it
would
have
be
anticipate
if
you
d
look
at
it

end
company
but
because
that
attitude
prevail
and
be
write
about
to
some
extent
i
think
that
generally
berkshire
be
undervalue
and
i
think
perhaps
the
valuation
be
get
more
appropriate
now
some
people
underestimate
how
berkshire
might
fare
in
short
they
can
t
see
where
it
s
all
go
that
doesn
t
mean
buffett
doesn
t
know
it
be
reminiscent
of
a
story
about
a
young
girl
draw
a
picture
when
an
adult
asks
her
what
she
s
draw
god
she
answer
but
nobody
know
what
god
look
like
the
adult
say
they
will
when
i
get
through
the
girl
reply
perhaps
the
king
of
berkshire
will
come
to
be
know
in
this
way
shareholder
paul
hartman
say
the
reason
that
berkshire
be
so
successful
be
because
buffett
take
the
free
cash
flow
of
its
asset
and
do
the
next
best
thing
with
it

there
be

whether
berkshire

some
of
its

one
of
the
more
lucid
series
of
posting
have
come
from
tode
who
in
real
life
be
michael
rhodes
a
lawyer
in
kansa
city
here
be
portion
of
tode
s
first
entry
of
december
i
be
new
to
this
post
board
but
have
be
a
brk
shareholder
since
just
spent
part
of
this
weekend
review
the
message
from
this
group
since
last
may
lot
of
interest
analysis
about
what
the
intrinsic
value
of
brk
be
a
question
i
have
be
very
much
interested
in
for
a
long
time
i
saw
a
lot
of
argument
on
how
to
value
the
insurance
float
it
appear
this
group
have
reach
a
consensus
the
float
be
worth
somewhere
between
a
negative
billion
and
a
positive
billion
may
i
offer
my
two
cent
worth
the
float
be
very
valuable
but
its
value
be
reflect
in
the
look
through
earnings
that
be
the
total
look
through
earnings
per
share
include
the
earnings
generate
from
both
asset
that
be
own
by
shareholder
equity
and
asset
that
be
own
by
others
float
and
defer
tax
the
look
through
earnings
also
reflect
the
cost
of
opm
other
people
s
money
that
the
shareholder
get
to
use
i
e
if
the
float
be
generate
with
an
underwriting
loss
the
loss
reduces
the
look
through
earnings
and
if
it
generates
an
underwriting
profit
the
profit
show
up
in
look
through
earnings
as
well
rather
than
try
to
specify
a
number
for
the
value
of
the
float
per
se
which
result
in
confusion
at
best
and
double
counting
at
bad
it
be
well
to
accept
the
fact
that
all
of
the
factor
which
determine
the
float
s
value
will
be
reflect
in
the
multiplier
on
this
company
time
look
through
earnings
for
give
you
a
share
another
useful
benchmark
be
twice
book
book
value
on
be
and
now
be
north
of
twice
book
put
you
over
a
share
the
stock
be
a
buy
in
later
posting
tode
say
he
think
buffett
s
method
of
calculate
look
through
earnings
be
too
conservative
mainly
because
he
ignores
the
retain
earnings
of
the
billion
of
equity
not
identify
and
the
subtraction
he
do
for
the
tax
that
would
be
owe
by
brk
if
all
earnings
be
paid
out
in
dividend
ignores
the
fact
that
the
earnings
be
actually
be
plow
back
into
the
business
and
inure
to
brk
s
benefit
another
poster
write
actually
without
the
billion
of
float
berkshire
s
investment
portfolio
would
perhaps
be
billion
less
since
the
float
increment
have
historically
be
reinvested
and
grown
just
like
any
other
component
net
cash
inflow
but
in
the
case
of
float
the
correspond
cash
flow
have
be
generate
at
zero
cost
and
so
represent
a
pure
and
undiluted
free
cash
flow
yet
another
post
one
of
the
early
no
brainer
valuation
method
i
use
be
future
look
through
earnings
keep
thing
simple
my
best
guess
for
look
through
earnings
be
about
per
share
just
multiply
this
number
by
the
correct
p
e
multiple
and
presto
you
have
the
intrinsic
value
what
s
the
correct
multiple
reasonable
mind
differ
of
course
if
ko
and
g
be
worth
time
next
year
s
earnings
the
same
multiple
should
apply
to
their
share
of
the
total
which
you
can
compute
easily
enough
other
holding
be
worth
maybe
to
time
earnings
you
could
calculate
the
average
weight
p
e
ratio
for
the
entire
equity
portfolio
if
you
be
feel
energetic
enough
then
you
have
to
add
something
to
reflect
the
leverage
on
the
balance
sheet
from
float
and
defer
tax
this
be
brk
s
secret
weapon
and
it
be
much
more
valuable
now
than
it
be
five
year
ago
a
lot
of
wall
street
expert
just
don
t
get
it
they
say
brk
be
a
close
end
fund
and
therefore
should
sell
at
a
discount
to
its
net
asset
a
well
analysis
be
a
margin
account
with
buffett
invest
two
dollar
of
asset
for
every
dollar
of
equity
but
even
this
analogy
fall
short
of
describe
reality
because
the
margin
debt
be
interest
free
the
defer
tax
cost
nothing
and
with
the
addition
of
geico
the
float
will
likely
be
generate
at
an
underwriting
profit
for
the
foreseeable
future
plus
the
pool
of
opm
be
constantly
grow
the
float
should
increase
about
a
billion
dollar
a
year
don
t
forget
that
geico
s
share
of
the
auto
insurance
market
be
tiny
and
they
have
only
begin
to
tap
the
standard
and
non
standard
driver
market
where
they
be
now
grow
at
a
rate
of
one
of
the
early
no
brainer
valuation
method
i
use
be
simply
to
take
total
asset
as
show
on
the
balance
sheet
with
no
adjustment
per
share
it
have
the
virtue
of
simplicity
and
in
a
rough
way
track
with
the
argument
that
have
be
present
in
these
posting
i
e
that
the
liability
be
not
real
and
should
be
ignore
if
you
ignore
the
float
liability
and
heavily
discount
the
defer
tax
liability
the
only
liability
that
remain
roughly
correspond
to
the
asset
value
of
the
future
float
growth
as
of
brk
have
asset
per
share
here
be
the
number
go
back
several
year
all
at
year
end







compare
to
the
high
each
year
for
brk
s
stock
price







there
have
be
a
rough
correlation
over
time
buffett
s
infamous
do
not
buy
my
stock
remark
last
spring
should
not
have
come
as
a
shock
to
anybody
it
be
grossly
out
of
its
normal
range
measure
by
asset
per
share
book
value
per
share
look
through
earnings
per
share
or
any
other
measure
i
would
argue
it
be
now
back
in
the
normal
range
here
s
a
post
from
jtayan
on
february
i
think
the
comment
by
web
i
never
give
stock
tip
but
if
i
die
buy
the
stock
be
in
response
to
numerous
comment
from
numerous
people
ask
what
would
happen
to
the
stock
if
he
die
he
be
try
to
say
that
there
be
value
in
the
company
without
his
be
there
i
think
if
he
die
the
stock
would
fall
at
least
initially
more
than
i
think
it
would
fall
below
book
value
however
his
next
in
command
would
probably
use
the
large
cash
flow
to
buy
back
stock
at
that
severely
discount
price
and
i
would
see
it
eventually
recover
to
at
least
or
of
intrinsic
value
that
be
why

of

that
basically

learn
about

with
such
question
as
be
katharine

related
to
ben
graham
no
another
rookie
be
thrown
by
all
the
reference
to

i
m
new
to
online
what
be
a
web
be
it
online

above
immediate
response
web
warren
e
buffett
chairman
of
berkshire
hathaway
on
july
tode
weigh
in
with
it
sound
simplistic
and
obvious
that
the
true
value
of
brk
be
the
confidence
shareholder
have
that
cash
flow
will
be
reinvested
at
return
that
far
exceed
the
ltgb
long
term
government
bond
rate
but
that
s
it
what
other
company
can
provide
this
same
assurance
for
the
long
term
compare
brk
to
a
zero
coupon
treasury
bond
with
a
coupon
i
have
always
felt
brk
to
be
superior
first
there
be
the
tax
advantage
of
be
able
to
defer
tax
until
you
decide
to
sell
second
while
there
be
no
guarantee
brk
will
achieve
return
on
reinvested
cash
flow
it
seem
highly
probable
third
it
be
impossible
for
a
zero
treasury
bond
to
earn
more
than
if
held
to
maturity
while
brk
historically
have
do
far
well
than
and
have
a
very
good
chance
in
my
opinion
of
achieve
web
s
goal
of
and
yes
there
be
a
real
possibility
more
than
a
pipe
dream
that
despite
web
s
disclaimer
it
just
may
beat
most
importantly
a
zero
coupon
bond
have
zero
brain
there
be
no
intellect
to
guide
the
reinvestment
of
capital
every
six
month
no
matter
what
opportunity
mr
market
may
serve
up
the
zero
coupon
bond
will
pas
them
up
and
mindlessly
compound
at
the
guaranteed
rate
until
maturity
while
no
brainer
investment
have
their
place
in
the
investment
universe
no
brain
often
be
preferable
to
the
average
professional
money
manager
you
pay
a
very
heavy
price
for
the
certainty
that
you
will
do
no
bad
than
the
coupon
rate
with

you

the

scour

you

it

ahead

from

the

face
berk
head
and
their
date
life
st
valentine
s
day
have
brought
a
big
issue
into
focus
as
a
single
male
out
there
in
the
date
world
i
be
wonder
just
how
do
you
explain
to
potential
significant
others
about
berkshire
and
buffett
i
ve
met
a
couple
of
nice
woman
lately
and
i
m
certain
they
ll
think
i
m
certifiable
i
m
afraid
that
if
the
topic
of
berkshire
and
buffett
come
up
i
avoid
the
topic
at
all
cost
i
ll
come
across
like
one
of
those
star
trek
people
who
attend
convention
wear
spock
ear
or
full
capt
kirk
attire
i
think
it
be
probably
best
if
i
don
t
come
out
of
the
closet
how
do
you
explain
the
shelf
full
of
annual
report
that
you
won
t
let
them
touch
how
do
you
explain
that
you
have
to
be
online
on
a
saturday
in
march
because
it
s
really
important
how
do
you
explain
that
you
have
to
go
to
omaha
every
year
how
do
you
explain
the
closet
full
of
berkshire
hathaway
active
wear
forget
even
try
to
explain
the
guy
in
the
yellow
hat
that
defies
explanation
my
mother
who
be
convince
i
ll
never
get
married
and
i
thank
you
in
advance
for
any
advice
sign
sleepless
in
nj
two
day
later
he
post
his
own
possible
solution
i
m
think
about
change
my
pick
up
line
to
wanna
come
upstairs
and
see
my
a
share
berkshire

profit
of
billion
on
march
for
and
the
stock
drop
trigger
this
post
from
mrdougfla
so
why
be
it
down
on
the

rampant
with

that

buffett
have
say
under
his
breath
when
he
get
it
at

imagine
how
that

joke
that
he
take
exception
to
the
hit
by
a

question
i
run
a
trucking
company
and
i
ve
instruct
our
driver
to
be
careful
not
to
hit
buffett
and
munger
because
they
the
driver
have
berkshire

wesco
in

plan
buffett
write
sullivan
after

p

no

it
s
highly
unlikely
that
buffett
will
die
by
be
hit
by
a
truck
but
his
intake
of
see
s
candy
coke
and
dilly
bar
make
tooth
decay
a
strong
possibility
nothing
will
be
force
by

tax
i
owe
that
to
people
in
case
i
step
in
an
elevator
shaft
absentmindedly
buffett
say
at
the
berkshire
annual
meeting
in
ask
at
the
annual
meeting
in
what
would
happen
to
berkshire
if
he
die
buffett
deadpanned
our
business
be
run
as
if
i
be
not
there
so
the
exact
location
of
my
body
shouldn
t
matter
buffett
later
told
cnbc
s
ron
insana
i
ll
put
my
ash
in
a
little
urn
there
and
keep
my
eye
on
thing
june
buffett
have
assure
shareholder
that
nothing
will
happen
to
his
berkshire
stock
if
he
be
to
march
through
the
cosmic
gate
not
a
single
share
of
my
stock
will
be
sell
he
say
at
that
time
all
his
berkshire
stock
be
slat
to
go
to
the
buffett
foundation
but
the
late
plan
for
buffett
s
stock
be
for
it
to
go
to
the
gate
foundation
it
s
a
marvelous
society
that
let
me
do
what
i
do
i
wouldn
t
be
worth
a
damn
in
bangladesh
or
peru
or
some
place
the
fact
that
i
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
it
and
can
consume
some
of
it
i
think
i
should
give
it
back
to
society
i
see
no
reason
why
i
should
create
some
dynasty
of
wealth
that
can
go
around
fan
themselves
he
say
on
adam
smith
s
money
world
show
in
connection
with
berkshire
s
annual
meeting
in
i
don
t
do
the
normal
exercise
and
i
don
t
eat
a
normal
diet
but
we
do
have
someone
in
mind
who
would
be
our
successor
if
charlie
and
i
be
to
die
at
once
and
on
my
death
not
a
share
of
stock
have
to
be
sell
i
have
promise
people
that
my
affair
will
not
cause
people
any
surprise
buffett
say
at
the
annual
meeting
in
at
the
meeting
in
he
say
you
have
two
question
as
shareholder
that
you
have
to
think
about
will
the
owner
behave
any
different
as
owner
and
will
the
manager
behave
any
different
as
manager
he
believe
the
answer
to
both
question
be
no
munger
follow
i
think
it
s
obvious
that
if
warren
die
tomorrow
the
prospect
of
the
company
would
be
somewhat
reduce
certainly
the
capital
allocation
process
couldn
t
be
make
well
under
any
foreseeable
scenario
however
i
do
think
a
company
like
berkshire
would
have
a
lot
of
time
to
find
a
successor
and
you
only
need
one
buffett
interject
maybe
less
munger
continued
and
i
don
t
think
that
you
should
assume
that
the
personality
who
put
the
whole
thing
together
would
be
incapable
of
find
a
successor
buffett
wound
up
the
discussion
by
minimize
his
role
it
s
an
easy
company
to
run
and
the
capital
allocation
process
may
be
self
defeat
anyway
over
time
and
there
s
nothing
that
say
we
can
forever
allocate
the
capital
well
than
you
so
as
the
year
go
by
it
s
not
inconceivable
that
we
could
have
a
policy
on
dividend
that
would
be
dramatically
different
than
the
present
one
because
we
believe
you
could
do
a
well
job
of
allocate
the
capital
than
we
could
partly
because
the
sum
would
be
so
large
and
charlie
say
we
re
look
forward
to
that
day
even
if
buffett
step
into
an
elevator
shaft
tomorrow
his
current
investment
would
live
on
people
will
go
on
drinking
coca
cola
shave
with
gillette
buying
world
book
product
and
use
their
american
express
card
berkshire
probably
would
hit
some
air
pocket
if
buffett
be
to
depart
and
some
suggest
a
huge
stock
price
drop
knock
out
what
many
observer
call
a
buffett
premium
such
fear
be
summarize
by
allan
sloan
a
columnist
at
newsday
at
the
time
of
this
comment
i
d
sure
hate
to
find
buyer
for
large
block
of
berkshire
stock
if
buffett
weren
t
there
still
that
might
be
the
best
moment
to
buy
at
the
annual
meeting
in
buffett
after
give
an
explanation
about
how
if
he
should
go
munger
would
run
thing
say
and
we
have
a
provision
beyond
that
next
he
say
that
he
have
almost
never
give
a
stock
tip
in
his
life
but
he
quickly
add
when
i
die
buy
the
stock
buffett
always
mean
what
he
say
and
say
what
he
mean
when
i
die
buy
the
stock
what
do
that
mean
no
one
know
for
sure
but
with
buffett
say
it
it
mean
what
it
say
one
shareholder
say
he
probably
mean
that
if
berkshire
take
a
big
dip
upon
his
death
the
stock
would
be
undervalue
and
be
a
buy
his
comment
suggests
some
finale
munger
have
say
berkshire
s
chairman
may
get
old
but
the
asset
aren
t
go
anywhere
and
the
nature
of
the
berkshire
game
be
that
we
do
not
have
to
replace
army
to
make
it
work
well
we
ve
run
so
lean
over
the
year
that
over
time
we
ve
only
get
two
or
three
crucially
important
body
to
replace
munger
have
also
state
we
ll
get
somebody
like
warren
there
s
the
rub
of
course
say
one
berkshire
shareholder
munger
can
do
everything
buffett
do
except
be
funny
at
the
annual
meeting
beyond
munger
will
berkshire
find
some
superb
individual
to
allocate
the
capital
sure
but
just
who
that
will
be
have
long
be
a
mystery
in
berkshire
s
annual
report
buffett
indicate
that
the
immediately
available
person
be
geico
s
lou
simpson
call
him
someone
who
could
handle
berkshire
s
investment
should
anything
happen
to
him
and
munger
ever
since
buffett
taught
investment
course
in
his
early
day
in
omaha
he
have
be
a
teacher
of
sort
his
occasional
talk
his
writing
his
fielding
of
question
at
annual
meeting
all
show
characteristic
of
a
teacher
berkshire
shareholder
judith
goodnow
prus
believe
berkshire
s
denouement
to
the
buffett
era
will
strike
a
theme
of
buffett
as
teacher
indeed
prus
say
it
seem
to
me
the
reason
he
be
so
quick
to
accept
the
salomon
challenge
it
be
a
make
to
order
opportunity
to
teach
some
ethical
as
well
as
economic
lesson
i
think
he
seize
the
opportunity
for
this
reason
not
just
to
protect
an
investment
i
think
he
be
so
intelligent
and
so
rational
and
so
realistic
that
he
must
understand
that
he
be
in
a
unique
position
to
teach
and
have
a
responsibility
to
do
so
perhaps
it
doesn
t
make
any
sense
for
him
to
teach
in
the
usual
sense
that
be
one
teacher
with
a
few
pupil
but
perhaps
some
day
soon
with
the
new
method
of
communication
he
would
be
able
to
invest
some
limited
amount
of
time
and
reach
a
lot
of
people
at
once
anyway
perhaps
the
denouement
will
be
one
big
lesson
i
hope
so
prus
say
john
train
money
master
of
our
time
p
see
less
of
a
legacy
for
buffett
where
do
buffett
stand
in
merit
with
other
public
figure
essentially
he
have
succeed
in
transfer
a
large
sum
from
the
pocket
of
less
skillful
investor
to
those
of
himself
and
his
follower
his
part
will
someday
be
turn
over
to
his
estrange
wife
for
this
purpose
an
unknown
quantity
and
then
to
trustee
to
manage
for
objective
of
uncertain
importance
but
will
the
whole
exercise
have
be
productive
that
s
not
buffett
s
concern
he
be
run
up
a
prodigious
score
not
building
jerusalem
the
other
significant
question
about
berkshire
be
to
figure
out
how
to
recognize
the
next
warren
buffett
say
a
berkshire
shareholder
add
that
he
have
often
try
to
convince
others
of
the
appeal
of
berkshire
with
almost
no
result
i
have
see
so
many
people
pas
it
up
say
one
berkshire
shareholder
i
would
like
for
my
child
to
be
able
to
recognize
the
next
berkshire
that
come
along
of
course
one
answer
be
to
recognize
this
buffett
and
not
worry
too
much
about
search
out
another
one
it
s
the
same
proposition
for
those
investor
who
try
to
figure
out
where
buffett
be
invest
or
how
to
copycat
his
investment
the
way
to
be
sure
you
be
do
what
buffett
be
do
be
simply
to
be
a
berkshire
shareholder
just
sit
back
like
you
re
on
a
greyhound
bus
and
leave
the
drive
the
invest
to
him
why
try
to
second
guess
buffett
just
enjoy
the
ride
at
sequoia
s
annual
meeting
in
sequoia
fund
president
bob
goldfarb
comment
on
the
uniqueness
of
berkshire
periodically
you
read
about
a
company
that
be
characterize
as
the
next
berkshire
hathaway
there
be
no
next
berkshire
hathaway
at
sequoia
s
annual
meeting
goldfarb
state
a
similar
thought
a
friend
of
mine
have
comment
that
everybody
be
always
look
for
the
next
warren
buffett
the
fact
be
that
there
be
no
next
warren
buffett
occasionally
rumor
that
buffett
be
up
for
a
government
job
or
be
under
consideration
to
head
the
new
york
stock
exchange
start
circulate
but
he
have
sidestep
all
that
with
the
assurance
i
ll
keep
do
this
allocate
cash
at
berkshire
as
long
as
i
live
linda
grant
los
angeles
time
april
i
think
he
s
an
american
genius
he
have
a
sterling
reputation
say
kahn
brother
irving
kahn
who
add
that
his
only
bone
to
pick
with
buffett
be
why
as
he
s
gotten
old
buffett
have
continued
to
concentrate
on
amass
wealth
rather
than
give
more
consideration
to
what
that
wealth
can
do
for
society
kahn
say
after
all
it
s
money
he
s
make
from
other
people
he
didn
t
create
the
telephone
or
invent
something
sooner
or
later
some
of
that
money
should
go
back
to
society
warren
buffett
look
good
versus
the
other
nefarious
collector
of
corporate
share
yet
his
gain
equal
the
loss
of
all
who
sell
to
him
maybe
after
so
many
brilliant
achievement
warren
buffett
will
use
his
energy
and
brain
for
broader
and
deeper
national
problem
one
problem
buffett
could
address
might
be
solve
the
longevity
problem
for
human
being
at
the
time
of
his
quote
kahn
be
year
old
have
the
clear
edge
he
and
his
sibling
all
of
whom
be
approach
year
of
age
at
the
turn
of
the
century
be
the
subject
of
a
harvard
study
into
longevity
the
wall
street
journal
august
buffett
agrees
with
bill
gate
s
comment
that
year
ago
buffett
would
have
just
be
some
animal
s
lunch
it
would
not
have
do
much
good
to
tell
the
animal
you
really
ought
to
see
me
allocate
asset
buffett
add
buffett
may
feel
that
the
more
wealth
he
can
accumulate
the
more
he
can
help
the
world
and
of
course
buffett
have
already
offer
a
lot
by
set
example
in
social
and
financial
behavior
for
all
the
buffett
berkshire
story
like
james
joyce
s
finnegans
wake
be
call
during
its
write
be
a
work
in
progress
almost
everyone
s
first
question
about
berkshire
be
what
happens
when
buffett
pass
on
the
query
persists
though
buffett
be
most
assuredly
not
on
his
deathbed
it
may
well
be
that
buffett
plan
on
surprising
people
by
do
what
he
s
do
until
a
very
late
age
perhaps
a
good
response
to
the
what
if
he
dy
question
be
what
if
he
life
he
seem
to
be
a
healthy
happy
and
energetic
man
and
he
just
may
live
beyond
the
next
quarter
s
earnings
statement
and
how
might
berkshire
do
if
buffett
life
a
long
life
berkshire
will
generate
significant
sum
of
investable
capital
and
buffett
will
deploy
this
money
successfully
say
steve
wallman
who
head
wallman
investment
counsel
in
madison
wisconsin
unfortunately
we
can
t
put
a
number
on
this
success
there
s
every
reason
to
think
the
investment
will
do
well
than
average
but
there
s
no
tell
how
much
well
or
what
average
will
be
wallman
add
most
people
look
at
berkshire
seem
to
suffer
from
a
lack
of
imagination
they
don
t
have
the
vaguest
idea
of
where
buffett
be
take
the
company
so
they
conclude
that
buffett
doesn
t
know
where
he
s
go
either
buffett
himself
have
give
every
indication
that
he
have
a
few
more
chapter
in
his
book
more
painting
to
do
on
his
berkshire
canvas
his
integrity
seem
to
me
to
be
involve
in
his
plan
for
the
ultimate
future
of
the
company
when
he
be
not
there
prus
say
everyone
who
know
him
seem
to
feel
comfortable
about
whatever
plan
he
might
have
for
the
company
we
all
seem
to
feel
that
it
will
be
right
honorable
and
good
we
trust
his
goodness
one
berkshire
shareholder
say
that
buffett
be
not
so
much
about
money
as
he
be
about
love
as
einstein
say
try
to
become
not
a
man
of
success
but
try
rather
to
become
a
man
of
value
even
if
he
didn
t
invent
penicillin
what
buffett
have
reaped
from
society
will
be
entirely
give
back
to
it
buffett
have
an
admiration
for
those
who
take
a
little
from
society
and
give
a
lot
back

be
the
permanent
value
that
buffett

munger
have
so
brilliantly
create
buffett
told
columbia
business
student
october
that
berkshire
would
be
easy
to
run
and
he
go
on
to
explain
why
and
how
berkshire
would
be
pretty
easy
to
run
it
s
in
marvelous
financial
shape
have
a
great
set
of
manager
in
the
operating
business
the
person
that
ran
it
would
have
to
do
two
thing
they
would
have
to
basically
keep
the
present
manager
motivate
and
happy
do
what
they
re
do
and
that
basically
mean
leave
them
alone
and
judging
them
by
the
right
standard
and
then
they
d
have
to
allocate
capital
they
could
partially
solve
the
capital
allocation
by
simply
establish
a
significant
dividend
policy
for
one
thing
they
d
have
to
get
one
good
idea
a
year
on
capital
allocation
and
the
manage
would
be
very
simple
buffett
write
of
his
role
in

and
of
succession
plan
in
berkshire
s
owner
s
manual
in
june
charlie
and
i
mainly
attend
to
the
capital
allocation
and
the
care
and
feed
of
our
key
manager
most
of
these
manager
be
happiest
when
they
be
left
alone
to
run
their
business
and
that
be
customarily
just
how
we
leave
them
that
put
them
in
charge
of
all
operating
decision
and
of
dispatch
the
excess
cash
they
generate
to
headquarters
by
send
it
to
us
they
don
t
get
divert
by
the
various
enticement
that
could
come
their
way
be
they
responsible
for
deploy
the
cash
their
business
throw
off
furthermore
charlie
and
i
be
expose
to
a
much
wider
range
of
possibility
for
invest
these
fund
than
any
of
our
manager
could
find
in
his
or
her
own
industry
most
of
our
manager
be
independently
wealthy
and
it
s
therefore
up
to
us
to
create
a
climate
that
encourages
them
to
choose
work
with
berkshire
over
golfing
or
fishing
this
leaf
us
need
to
treat
them
fairly
and
in
the
manner
that
we
would
wish
to
be
treat
if
our
position
be
reverse
as
for
the
allocation
of
capital
that
s
an
activity
both
charlie
and
i
enjoy
and
in
which
we
have
acquire
some
useful
experience
in
a
general
sense
gray
hair
doesn
t
hurt
on
this
play
field
you
don
t

well
tone
muscle
to

around
thank
heaven
as
long
as
our
mind
continue
to
function
effectively
charlie
and
i
can
keep
on
do
our
job
pretty
much
as
we
have
in
the
past
on
my
death
berkshire
s
ownership
picture
will
change
but
not
in
a
disruptive
way
first
only
about
of
my
stock
will
have
to
be
sell
to
take
care
of
bequest
and
tax
second
the
balance
of
my
stock
will
go
to
my
wife
susan
if
she
survives
or
to
a
family
foundation
if
she
doesn
t
in
either
event
berkshire
will
posse
a
control
shareholder
guide
by
the
same
philosophy
and
objective
that
set
our
course
at
that
juncture
the
buffett
family
will
not
be
involve
in
manage
the
business
only
in
pick
and
oversee
the
manager
who
do
just
who
those
manager
will
be
of
course
depends
on
the
date
of
my
death
but
i
can
anticipate
what
the
management
structure
will
be
essentially
my
job
will
be
split
in
two
part
with
one
executive
become
responsible
for
investment
and
another
for
operation
if
the
acquisition
of
new
business
be
in
prospect
the
two
will
cooperate
in
make
the
decision
need
both
executive
will
report
to
a
board
of
director
that
will
be
responsible
to
the
control
shareholder
whose
interest
will
in
turn
be
align
with
yours
be
we
to
need
the
management
structure
i
have
just
described
on
an
immediate
basis
my
family
and
a
few
key
individual
know
who
i
would
pick
to
fill
both
post
both
currently
work
for
berkshire
and
be
people
in
whom
i
have
total
confidence
i
will
continue
to
keep
my
family
post
on
the
succession
issue
since
berkshire
stock
will
make
up
virtually
my
entire
estate
and
will
account
for
a
similar
portion
of
the
asset
of
either
my
wife
or
the
foundation
for
a
considerable
period
after
my
death
you
can
be
sure
i
have
thought
through
the
succession
question
carefully
you
can
be
equally
sure
that
the
principle
we
have
employ
to
date
in
run
berkshire
will
continue
to
guide
the
manager
who
succeed
me
l
we
end
on
a
morbid
note
i
also
want
to
assure
you
that
i
have
never
felt
well
i
love
run
berkshire
and
if
enjoy
life
promotes
longevity
methuselah

will
recall
from
your
careful
reading
of

old
in
buffett
say
he
have
four
possible
successor
in
mind
to
run
berkshire
he
note
they
be
not
in
their
s
because
he
want
his
successor
to
have
a
long
run
in
any
event
one
should
not
wish
buffett
to
be
in
any
hurry
to
leave
rather
we
should
wish
him
immortality
as
he
have
wish
it
for
his
manager
we
should
fully
enjoy
the
presence
of
this
genius

we
can

the

undiminished
something

buffett
told

that
berkshire

within

hour
should
the
need
arise
he
add
that
the
board
have
several
name
but
there
be
one
person
they
all
agree
on
the
story
of
warren
buffett
of
permanent
value
yesterday
i
die

subtle
change
at
the
time
of
the
berkshire
blue
chip
merger
in
buffett
set
down
owner
related
business
principle
later
in
berkshire
issue
a
booklet
about
the
principle
entitle
an
owner
s
manual
subtle
change
to
the
manual
in
berkshire
s
annual
report
be
first
point
out
by
mick
rhodes
a
lawyer
in
kansa
city
it
be
funny
how
these
little
change
can
sneak
in
under
everybody
s
radar
screen
even
though
thousand
of
people
be
dissect
every
word
rhodes
say
i
stumble
across
it
by
accident
reading
the
part
about
berkshire
governance
in
the
letter
i
notice
web
use
the
term
successor
instead
of
successor
and
wonder
if
he
be
change
the
plan
i
then
look
at
the
owner
s
manual
at
the
end
of
the
report
which
i
have
not
bother
to
read
before
and
there
it
be
spell
out
as
clear
as
night
and
day
rhodes
continued
in
the
part
of
the
manual
deal
with
succession
of
web
it
use
to
say
that
his
job
will
be
split
into
two
part
with
one
executive
become
responsible
for
investment
and
another
for
operation
in
this
year
s
manual
it
change
another
for
operation
to
read
another
who
will
be
ceo
for
operation
some
people
have
express
concern
with
the
idea
that
two
people
would
be
act
as
co
ceo
s
after
web
be
go
a
model
of
management
that
rarely
have
work
well
in
the
real
world
i
think
the
change
in
word
may
be
aim
at
reassure
investor
that
while
both
officer
will
work
closely
together
especially
on
acquisition
where
their
role
will
overlap
there
will
be
one
and
only
one
ceo
i
like
this
clarification
the
same
theme
be
stress
in
the
letter
in
the
discussion
of
berkshire
governance
web
say
the
primary
job
of
our
director
be
to
select
my
successor
no
plural
just
one
successor
the
ceo
he
say
the
board
have
identify
four
internal
candidate
to
replace
him
and
discus
their
strength
and
weakness
at
board
meeting
i
m
totally
comfortable
about
it
be
do
well
by
any
of
the
four
candidate
we
have
identify
note
the
job
description
of
the
ceo
successor
he
or
she
will
need
to
maintain
berkshire
s
culture
allocate
capital
and
keep
a
group
of
america
s
best
manager
happy
in
their
job
again
web
be
explicitly
state
that
the
ceo
in
charge
of
operation
also
be
responsible
for
allocation
of
capital
the
investment
officer
s
capital
allocation
role
it
seem
to
me
will
be
focus
primarily
on
passive
investment
much
as
lou
simpson
s
role
at
geico
be
presently
define
the
broader
issue
of
how
capital
be
allocate
in
new
acquisition
or
expansion
of
exist
business
will
be
the
primary
responsibility
of
the
ceo
the
old
version
of
the
manual
also
say
be
we
to
need
the
management
structure
i
have
just
described
on
an
immediate
basis
my
family
and
a
few
key
individual
know
who
i
would
pick
to
fill
both
post
both
currently
work
for
berkshire
and
be
people
in
whom
i
have
total
confidence
this
year
s
new
version
substitute
our
director
for
my
family
and
a
few
key
individual
and
instead
of
say
both
currently
work
for
berkshire
it
say
all
candidate
currently
work
for
berkshire
lou
simpson
be
long
ago
identify
by
web
as
the
investment
officer
who
could
succeed
web
s
invest
role
if
the
truck
then
arrive
but
give
lou
s
age
only
six
year
young
than
web
i
think
it
be
unlikely
that
he
will
be
the
investment
officer
successor
one
last
change
i
stumble
across
the
manual
say
before
this
year
that
upon
web
s
death
only
about
of
my
stock
will
have
to
be
sell
to
take
care
of
bequest
and
tax
now
it
have
be
change
to
read
none
of
my
stock
will
have
to
be
sell
to
take
care
of
bequest
and
tax
interest
it
seem
to
me
that
web
be
add
several
touch
to
this
year
s
letter
and
revise
owner
s
manual
to
reassure
investor
that
his
departure
will
not
be
as
disruptive
as
many
have
fear
these
change
in
word
be
part
of
the
effort
but
by
far
the
big
part
of
the
effort
lie
in
the
table
of
operating
earnings
growth
rate
on
page
the
message
be
clear
that
web
want
the
market
to
understand
that
berkshire
be
not
just
his
personal
invest
account
it
be
an
operating
company
with
rapidly
grow
operating
earnings
his
emphasis
that
i
don
t
believe
that
use
as
the
terminal
year
distorts
our
calculation
far
drive
the
point
home
that
these
earnings
be
go
to
keep
grow
as
he
say
in
the
section
deal
with
his
ceo
successor
the
train
be
already
move
at
a
good
clip
down
the
track
an
all
but
unnoticed
change
in
the
manual
in
say
all
berkshire
share
will
be
left
to
one
or
more
foundation
italic
add
in
this
way
berkshire
will
be
left
with
a
long
term
very
substantial

the

by
the

philosophy
and
objective
that
now
set
our
course

the
bulk
of
buffett

wealth
the
fruit
of
his
lifetime
of
long
term

be
slat
to
go
to
the
buffett
foundation
and
then
back
to
society
at
the
time
of
his
death
but
plan
sometimes
change
as
of
the

of
his

to
go
to

the
timing
of
this
distribution
be
change
from
the
time
of
his
death
to
begin
the
distribution
right

in

buffett

foundation
rename
the
susan
thompson
buffett
foundation
in
honor
of

then
buffett
shift
his
think
and
decide
to
leave
most
of
his
money
to
the
gate

make
it
far

the
question
of
whether
to
leave
a
fortune
to
society
sooner
or
later
be
always
a
good
debate
fortune
summarize
the
issue
march
buffett
say
it
s
a
good
thing
gate
wait
as
long
as
he
do
if
he
have
give
away
of
his
money
year
ago
it
would
have
be
at
a
huge
cost
to
society
say
buffett
give
away
that
money
early
on
might
have
cheat
the
world
out
of
billion
instead
he
have
be
run
the
best
perform
endowment
fund
in
the
world
the
counter
argument
be
that
there
be
a
time
value
of
money
to
charity
as
well
that
be
if
gate
have
give
away
say
million
year
ago
to
eradicate
a
disease
and
that
money
have
found
a
cure
and
the
cure
have
save
life
let
alone
save
billion
in
health
care
cost
how
do
you
assign
a
value
to
that
there
be
no
right
answer
of
course
gate
say
most
of
his
money
will
go
to
charity
mainly
to
health
and
education
cause
instead
of
his
child
gate

large
sum
to
various
effort
include
combat
aid
in
india
and
particularly
vaccination
effort
in
africa
gate
sound
like
buffett
say
i
don
t
think
it
s
constructive
for
child
to
grow
up
have
billion
of
dollar
certainly
i
ll
make
sure
they
his
three
child

care
of
in
a
sense
that
they
can
have
a
very
comfortable

plan
parenthood
and
try
to
reduce
the
risk
of
nuclear
war
and
promote

at
that
time
the
foundation
give
away
about
to
million

his
big

always

he
think
it
s
a
danger
to
the
world
that
you
can
have
it
all
but
if
you
have
overpopulation
the

what

certainly
i
consider

to
be
important
issue
and
i
may
write
about
them
one
day
but
until
then
i
don
t
want
to
comment
on
the
question
or
become
a
spokesman
i
d
end
up
get
letter
a

it
would
change
my

i
enjoy
the
idea
of
building
an
endowment

up
for
society
i
mean
i
enjoy
the
process
by
itself
but
if
you
think
about
it
if
i
d
do
all
of
that
year
ago
society
would
have
have
a
few
hundred
million
dollar

claim
check
and
now
if
i
die
tonight
they
d
have
billion

so
it
s
not
a

six

nothing
that
tie

in
any
way
i

i
want
them
to
tackle
problem
that
generally
don
t
have
a
funding
constituency
so
that
they
re
not
the
kind
of
thing
that
government
can
attack
well
and
that
be
not
be
attack
by
philanthropy
generally
i
want
them
to
try
and
do
something
big
buffett

increase
his
wealth
affect
only
the
amount
he
will
be
able

not
his

it
just
doesn
t
make
any
difference
it
will
make
a

to
the

financial
time
may
in
a
statement
december
buffett
say
that
he
and
his
wife
have
donate
class
a
share
worth
about
million
at
the
stock
price
then
to
four
unnamed
charity
he
say
he
be
disclose
the
fact
so
that
investor
do
not
think
he
be
sell
mr
and
mr
buffett
be
make
this
announcement
because
there
have
be
occasion
when
gift
by
them
have
be
report
in
the
medium
as
sale
the
statement
say
mr
and
mr
buffett
have
never
sell
any
berkshire
share
the
statement
say
the
charity
receive
the
stock
have
agree
not
to
sell
more
than
share
during
any
one
week
period
one
berkshire
shareholder
note
on
aol
s
berkshire
message
board
that
he
be
notify
by
his
designate
charity
it
have
receive
the
donation
from
berkshire
in
general
dynamic
stock
another
shareholder
post
a
lighthearted
hypothesis
i
didn
t
realize
berkshire
ever
make
stock
contribution
instead
of
cash
but
this
make
sense
for
the
same
reason
it
make
sense
for
an
individual
to
donate
appreciate
security
you
effectively
sell
the
stock
and
avoid
the
capital
gain
tax
for
year
we
have
debate
how
to
handle
the
defer
tax
liability
in
intrinsic
value
calculation
now
we
see
that
with
this
nifty
trick
the
tax
liability
on
coke
and
others
can
be
avoid
just
give
all
million
share
of
coke
away
to
charity
in
annual
increment
spread
over
the
next
year
and
voila
the
capital
gain
tax
liability
be
zero
cool
buffett
have
praise
bill
gate
for
his
philanthropy
pay
tribute
in
an
article
he
write
for
time
april
a
few
year
ago
bill
and
melinda
gate
ask
themselves
how
they
could
dramatically
help
the
life
of
the
most
people
per
dollar
spent
and
then
set
out
to
spend
more
dollar
on
the
idea
they
come
up
with
than
have
ever
before
be
devote
to
any
philanthropic
effort
from
the
start
they
agree
that
their
money
be
not
to
be
allocate
base
on
recognition
or
applause
they
might
receive
nor
on
the
race
color
or
creed
of
the
recipient
rather
the
cash
would
be
channel
so
as
to
address
the
vital
need
indeed
in
many
case
the
very
survival
of
people
around
the
world
with
breathtaking
speed
they
turn
those
thought
into
reality
by
focus
on
global
health
and
learn
issue
in
their
foundation
make
one
of
the
large
charitable
pledge
ever
million
for
child
vaccine
it
may
make
sense
to
do
something
very
significant
before
i
die
a
hint
about
buffett
s
mega
announcement
concern
the
gate
foundation
come
when
fortune
october
report
the
follow
exchange
about
charitable
give
between
buffett
and
gate
the
day
they
talk
to
student
at
the
university
of
nebraska
lincoln
fortune
you
have
different
philosophy
about
philanthropy
with
bill
give
a
lot
of
his
money
away
today
and
warren
wait
until
he
dy
to
give
it
away
what
argument
would
you
make
to
the
other
that
your
way
be
the
right
way
buffett
well
i
think
his
way
be
well
he
and
melinda
they
re
devote
a
huge
amount
of
money
terrific
brain
and
heart
to
it
that
s
a
great
combination
i
couldn
t
have
do
that
when
i
be
in
my
s
and
add
anything
meaningful
at
my
age
now
you
can
argue
that
a
very
significant
percentage
of
the
money
have
be
make
and
i
don
t
need
the
stock
to
control
berkshire
so
it
may
make
sense
to
do
something
very
significant
before
i
die
fortune
be
this
a
change
for
you
buffett
it
s
an
evolution
gate
in
i
be
just
get
start
in
philanthropy
and
back
then
i
would
have
say
look
it
s
too
confuse
and
distract
to
be
ask
for
money
and
give
money
away
at
the
same
time
i
didn
t
think
i
could
spare
the
time
as
my
dad
encourage
me
to
jump
in
as
melinda
weigh
in
on
that
side
and
both
of
them
be
willing
to
put
time
into
it
we
get
a
great
person
in
steve
ballmer
who
actually
i
d
know
at
microsoft
a
long
time
the
piece
really
fell
together
i
d
always
thought
that
i
would
wait
until
i
be
do
work
full
time
before
i
d
do
a
lot
of
philanthropy
but
it
s
work
amazingly
well
to
be
able
to
do
some
of
both
buffett
bill
s
get
a
well
mind
for
it
i
couldn
t
do
what
he
do
i
wouldn
t
get
any
enjoyment
because
i
would
know
i
wasn
t
that
good
at
it
i
want
to
see
the
money
use
intelligently
i
don
t
regard
my
death
as
be
the
perfect
timing
necessarily
fortune
do
you
two
talk
about
this
buffett
oh
sure
gate
absolutely
fortune
be
you
try
to
persuade
warren
to
be
as
hand
on
in
philanthropy
as
you
be
gate
no
but
i
share
the
enjoyment
i
get
out
of
it
and
some
of
the
fun
dynamic
the
dynamic
of
what
work
and
doesn
t
work
it
s
a
lot
like
the
world
of
business
not
enough
that
you
can
just
walk
into
it
but
you
learn
some
of
the
specific
and
then
the
experience
of
business
applies
buffett
berkshire
be
so
much
a
part
of
me
that
i
never
could
walk
away
from
it
but
i
don
t
think
that
i
m
go
to
quintuple
my
personal
fortune
in
six
or
eight
year
the
amount
be
big
enough
now
to
do
very
significant
thing
and
way
different
than
when
i
be
in
my
s
i
mean
if
i
have
do
this
in
my
s
it
might
have
be
million
now
we
ve
get
a
sum
that
can
do
something
significant
and
i
don
t
need
it
to
control
berkshire
nobody
s
go
to
take
over
berkshire
at
its
present
size
which
be
not
the
case
year
ago
gate
i
d
never
thought
that
give
wealth
to
my
own
kid
could
be
disadvantageous
until
i
read
a
fortune
article
buffett
should
you
leave
it
all
to
the
child
september
gate
right
warren
be
a
strong
voice
in
that
article
and
after
i
read
it
i
thought
wow
it
would
be
a
mistake
as
you
get
past
a
certain
amount
to
hand
it
all
down
so
this
idea
that
it
should
all
go
back
to
society
warren
influence
me
dramatically
on
that
buffett
and
he
s
do
a
well
job
laughter
it
s
interest
that
the
same
people
who
talk
about
the
terrible
cycle
of
dependency
that
welfare
brings
will
then
hand
their
kid
when
they
emerge
from
the
womb
a
lifetime
supply
of
food
stamp
but
some
poor
woman
who
s
have
two
pregnancy
by
the
time
she
s
they
say
oh
this
be
terrible
to
give
her
anything
the
change
of
buffett

heart
in

in
this
discussion
come
into
fruition
in
when

he
felt
the

didn
t
go
far
enough
buffett
felt
that
the
repeal
of
the

tax
might
keep
wealth
in
the
hand
of
a
few
and
stall

to
make
the
u

even
more

than
it
be
in
buffett
say
that
bush
s
plan
to
cut
the
dividend
tax
would
benefit
the
rich
unfairly
he
told
a

of

that
get
rid
of
the
dividend
tax
the
centerpiece
of
bush
s
billion
tax
cut
proposal
would
slice
berkshire
s
tax
bill
by
million
but
he
add
that
meant
that
he
would
pay
proportionately
less
in
tax
than
his
secretary
bloomberg
march
buffett
and
some
other
business
leader
call
on
congress
not
to
pas
an
economic
stimulus
bill
particularly
the
provision
repeal
the
tax
on
stock
dividend
buffett
be
quote
as
say
there
may
be
some
stimulus
need
but
i
don
t
think
that
the
policy
that
s
be
put
forth
be
a
good
tax
policy
or
a
good
stimulus
policy
go
far
he
write
in
a
column
in
the
washington
post
may
that
the
plan
to
eliminate
tax
on
dividend
amount
to
voodoo
economics
a
term
bush
s
father
once
use
to
describe
trickle
down
reaganomics
the
senate
decide
that
the

an
individual
receives
should
be

free

then
again
fully
taxable
in
the
mental
flexibility
the
senate
demonstrate
in
craft
these
zigzag
be
breathtaking
what
it
have
put
in
motion
though
be
clear
if
enact
these
change
would
far
tilt
the
tax
scale
toward
the
rich
suppose
this
measure
go
through
and
the
director
of
berkshire
hathaway
which
do
not
now
pay
a
dividend
therefore
decide
to
pay
billion
in

next
year

i
would
receive
million

and
see
my
tax

plunge
to
and
our
receptionist
she
d
still
be

about
percent
which

warren

his

his
dramatic
run

while
the
land
of

be
the
country
s
richest
state
it
be
also
beset
by
seemingly
intractable
financial
problem
that
only
a
monumental
effort
could
mend
if
warren
buffett
think
arnold
schwarzenegger
have
the
chop
to
run
the
world
s
sixth

quote

to
be
an
odd
couple
yet
they
ve
be
friend
since
the
mid
s
for
buffett
this
be
a
case
of
out
of

off
to

i
have
know
arnold
for

know
he
ll
be
a
great

critical
to
the
rest
of
the

that
california

and
i
think
arnold
will
get
the

do
buffett
say
in
a
statement
buffett
add
it
s
up
to
arnold
if
he
asks
me
for
idea
i
ll
be
glad
to
help
supply
them
but
he
admit
there
be
no
magical
idea
that
would
solve
california
s
budget
crisis
they
schwarzenegger
and
his

team
don
t

if
the
two
coincide

fine

that

to
meet
buffett
no
one
be
smarter
or
have
well
people

than
warren
oberndorf
say
investor
such
as
myself
have
benefit
enormously
by
the
example
warren
have

of
discipline
invest
combine
with
the

standard
john
brennan
hail
from
central
fall
rhode

john
brennan
graduate
summa

electric
management
program
for
several
year
before
go
on
to
stanford
business
school
brennan
recall
a
time
that
buffett
come
to
mcdonald
s
class
of
people
and
spoke
about
long
term
invest
he
told
us
about
the
performance
of
his
partnership
relative
to
the
performance
of
some
mutual
fund
one
of
which
be
massachusetts
investor
trust
which
i
later
go
to
work
for
he
told
us
how
important
it
be
to
have
little
turnover
say
that
compound
work
much
well
without
transaction
fee
and
tax
even
make
an
extra
percentage
point
over
time
can
amount
to
big
money
year
later
he
go
through
his
evolution
of
buying
hard
asset
like
ben
graham
and
of
recognize
that
buying
good
business
at
reasonable
price
can
be
even
more
valuable
buffett
with
munger
encourage
him
come
to
see
that
the
durability
of
the
company
and
its
opportunity
to
reinvest
cash
flow
profitably
matter
find
a
business
that
would
have
good
cash
flow
five
and
year
later
could
make
for
an
investment
with
a
big
payoff
he
use
the
example
of
geico
which
be
undervalue
in
the
early
s
i
view
him
as
someone
who
have
a
successful
way
of
look
at
thing
he
make
a
lot
of
sense
buffett
also
talk
to
the
class
about
risk
say
that
theoretical
factor
about
how
stock
trade
their
volatility
and
beta
and
all
meant
little
compare
to
a
real
understand
of
a
long
term
investment
brennan
say
mcdonald
excel
at
teach
conceptual
material
but
he
kept
the
focus
on
real
world
invest
brennan
recall
that
at
one
point
mcdonald
brought
in
three
guest
speaker
each
one
an
expert
in
his
area
one
in
speculation
one
in
gamble
and
one
in
investment
he
want
us
to
see
why
they
do
what
they
do
what
make
them
successful
and
what
be
the
element
of
mastery
that
differentiate
them
from

but
never

any
of
the

still
it
turn
out
that
both

fisher
last
lecture
in

in
spring
outstanding
investor
digest
volume
xv
number
he
spoke
of
the
importance
of
find
superb
management
say
to
make
the
really
long
range
gain
there
be
a
couple
of
thing
that
be
necessary
first
be
outstanding
management
one
way
to
recognize
proper
management
be
to
look
for
management
s
response
to
change
this
be
the
basis
or
the
gist
of
my
sermon
today
just
as
some
of
you
be
smarter
than
others
some
of
you
recognize
opportunity
that
most
of
the
rest
won
t
even
realize
be
there
and
the
importance
of
that
difference
never
cease
to
amaze
me
sometimes
the
result
of
that
difference
be
that
a
particular
company
drop
from
be
of
its
industry
down
to
but
frequently
it
s
a
matter
of
survival
and
it
s
not
just
true
of
people
and
company
but
also
of
nation
those
with
the
right
people
and
the
desire
to
improve
themselves
be
those
that
grow
and
progress
whereas
those
that
live
with
the
status
quo
decline
in
addition
to
emphasize
the
need
for
outstanding
management
fisher
believe
that
the
business
franchise
matter
customer
loyalty
matter
and
brand
name
recognition
matter
fisher
also
make
a
point
to
the
class
of
about
diversification
i
believe
strongly
in
diversification
and
by
that
he
meant
seven
or
eight
stock
a
concentrate
portfolio
in
today
s
parlance
importantly
fisher
himself
do
the
lion
s
share
of
the
investment
research
on
company
own
by
the
client
of
fisher
company
so
that
he
have
a
high
level
of
knowledge
and
conviction
on
each
of
the
seven
or
eight
company
i
do
not
believe
in
overdiversifying
my
basic
theory
be
to
know
a
few
company
and
know
them
really
well
and
be
sure
your
diversification
be
real
diversification
have
ford
and
general
motor
be
not
diversification
diversification
mean
own
company
that
do
not
sell
into
the
same
market
company
with
real
difference
but
it
be
my
opinion
that
once
you
get
over
eight
or
stock
you
get
into
danger
because
people
just
be
not
that
good
there
aren
t
that
many
opportunity
available
the
last
thing
i
want
be
to
own
a
lot
of
good
stock
i
want
a
very
few
outstanding
one
mcdonald
recall
that
lecture
this
be
the
best
of
phil
fisher
in
my
experience
and
he
be
and
ill
at
the
time
of
the
class
it
be
a
truly
inspire
and
memorable
class
with
a
great
investor
the
last
class
phil
be
able
to
attend
fisher
always
say
to
think
of
the
long
term
and
have
low
turnover
in
your
portfolio
fisher
bought
motorola
in
back
when

telecom
meant
radio
system
for

car
in
the
investment
course
mcdonald
take
in

about

later
when
he
die
in
after
fisher
s
death
his
son
kenneth
fisher
write
an
article
for
forbes
april
that
suggest
some
thought
his
father
might
have
have
at
that
particular
time
be
he
alive
and
in
his
right
mind
this
be
one
of
the
point
he
make
in
your
bone
believe
in
capitalism
and
its
basic
ability
despite
recession
and
scandal
to
well
the
human
condition
from
that
belief
you
can
conclude
that
over
the
long
term
the
stock
market
work
fisher
be
a
frequent
reader
of
the
rudyard

sought
out
phil

after
reading
his
common
stock
and

profit
in
the
early
s
buffett
write
in
a
article
in
forbes
from
him
i
learn
the
value
of
the
scuttlebutt
approach
go
out
and
talk
to
competitor
supplier
and
customer
to
find
out
how
an
industry
or
a
company
really
operates
fisher
offer
these
point
to
look
for
in
a
common
stock
do
the
company
have
product
or
service
with
sufficient
market
potential
to
make
possible
a
sizeable
increase
in

continue
to

the

how
effective
be

other
aspect
of
the

somewhat
peculiar
to
the

involve
which
will
give
the

important
clue
as
to
how
outstanding
the
company
will
be
in
relation
to
its
competition
do
the

look

as
its

be
to

accurate
it
should

we

the

non
economic
benefit

strictly
on
its

first
we
must
estimate

some
graduate
will
find
that
the

value
of

exceeds
its

mean
that

paid
for

the

i
thought
it
would

to
go

at

earlier

list
in

go
for
more
than

i
didn
t
expect
warren
to
be
fall
to
piece
like
most
of
the
pseudo
expert
i
have
be
watch
and
reading
about
the
past
few
hour
but
i
be
certainly
anxious
to
hear
whatever
he
have
to
say
in
the
event
we
be
perhaps
the
two
calmest
people
in
omaha
if
not
the
entire
world
of
finance
i
call
on
warren
in
his
modest
office
suite
and
found
him
slightly
less
of
a
technophobe
than
rumor
would
have
it
a
cable
tv
ticker
show
be
on
with
the
sound
turn
off
of
course
he
hasn
t
go
loony
and
he
confess
that
he
do
fool
around
a
bit
on
the
internet
though
chiefly
to
play
long
distance
bridge
game
with
unfailing
graciousness
he
show
me
some
memorabilia
of
the
humble
beginning
of
his
investment
career
and
we
talk
of
his
old
mentor
benjamin
graham
who
have
be
schedule
to
be
my
guest
on
wall
treet
week
with
louis
rukeyser
when
he
contract
his
final
illness
then
because
warren
have
to
fly
that
afternoon
to
what
would
be
the
last
director
meeting
of
salomon
brother
prior
to
its
merger
with
smith
barney
we
move
on
to
lunch
at
a
club
within
the
building
here
i
have
another
surprise
the
one
thing
i
have
be
told
to
view
as
an
absolute
certainty
be
that
buffett
a
famously
large
stockholder
of
coca
cola
never
drank
anything
but
cherry
coke
but
when
i
order
an
iced
tea
he
immediately
say
that
sound
good
let
me
have
an
iced
tea
too
a
subtle
investment
tip
nope
just
evidence
that
he
be
a
nice
and
not
wholly
predictable
guy
two
quality
that
have
surely
help
him
mightily
along
the
way
similarly
when
i
mention
that
there
be
now
at
least
one
web
site
provide
a
warren
buffett
screen
supposedly
listing
stock
he
might
buy
and
that
the
proprietor
have
chortle
publicly
after
berkshire
hathaway
announce
oct
that
it
would
purchase
one
of
the
company
on
the
list
international
dairy
queen
for
million
buffett
s
response
be
instructive
oh
we
never
would
have
bought
that
as
a
stock
lou
but
buying
the
whole
business
make
some
sense
to
us
it
would
only
have
to
be
two
third
as
attractive
on
that
basis
primarily
for
tax
reason
his
reaction
to
the
overall
market
panic
be
in
the
same
almost
disdainful
vein
if
you
can
t
buy
a
stock
and
not
even
worry
about
whether
the
market
be
go
to
shut
for
the
next
three
year
he
told
me
you
shouldn
t
buy
the
stock
at
all
the
intense
volatility
that
have
so
many
lesser
investor
gulp
down
heart
medicine
be
merely
far
evidence
of
what
ben
graham
have
dubbed
mr
market
a
hysterical
fellow
from
whose
day
to
day
behavior
you
should
separate
yourself
whenever
possible
the
sensible
way
to
buy
a
stock
warren
reiterate
be
to
think
of
it

the

with

arrange

buffett
told

that
he
have
an
interest
and
enjoyable
time
lunch
with
clinton
at
the
home
of
buffett
s
daughter
susie
i
say
that
from
the
way
buffett
described
the
meeting
i
presume
that
we
should
not
expect
any
national
policy
decision
to
result
buffett
and
clinton
lunch
alone
and
the
conversation
range
over
a
variety
of
topic
he
s
a
very
brilliant
guy
on
just
one
subject
after
another
buffett
say
you
may
agree
or
disagree
with
him
on
policy
but
his
range
of
knowledge
be
very
impressive
i
ask
if
their
conversation
touch
on
the
california
gubernatorial
election
in
which
clinton
be
campaign
hard
for
retain

while

advise
republican
candidate
arnold
schwarzenegger
on
economic
policy
they
touch
only
briefly
on
the
california
situation
buffett
indicate
incidentally
buffett
say
that
to
postpone
the
resolution
of
the
gubernatorial
issue
in
california
until
say
a
march
election
would
be
very
unfortunate
california
s
economic
crisis
must
be
address
promptly
he
say
because
the
health
of
the
california
economy
have
such
importance
to
the
entire
nation
that
s
why
i
get

one
day

in
the
fall
of

with
a

donald

afterward
buffett
say
chicago

i
ve
get
a
conviction
about
him
obama
that
i
don
t
get
very
often
he
have
as
much
potential
as
anyone
i
ve
see
to
have
an
important
impact
over
his
lifetime
on
the
course
that
america
take
if
he
can
do
an
ounce
well
with
me
fine
in

of
a
visit
with

buffett
have
invite
me
to
omaha
to
discus
tax
policy
more
specifically
he
want
to
know
why
washington
continued
to
cut
tax
for
people
in
his
income
bracket
when
the
country
be
broke
i
do
a
calculation
the
other
day
he
say
as
we
sat
down
in
his
office
though
i
ve
never
use
tax
shelter
or
have
a
tax
planner
after
include
the
payroll
tax
we
each
pay
i
ll
pay
a
low
effective
tax
rate
this
year
than
my
receptionist
in
fact
i
m
pretty
sure
i
pay
a
low
rate
than
the
average
american
and
if
the
president
have
his
way
i
ll
be
pay
even
less
buffett
s
low
rate
be
a
consequence
of
the
fact
that
like
most
wealthy
american
almost
all
his
income
come
from
dividend
and
capital
gain
investment
income
that
since
have
be
taxed
at
only
percent
the
receptionist
s
salary
on
the
other
hand
be
taxed
at
almost
twice
that
rate
once
fica
be

from

perspective
the
discrepancy
be
unconscionable

s
the
best
mechanism
ever
devise
to
put
resource
to
their
most
efficient
and
productive
use
he
told
me
the
government
isn

particularly
good
at
that
but
the
market
isn
t
so
good
at

that
the

wisely
some
of
that

have

that
the

of
safety
net
for
those
who
lose
out
in
a

it
just
make

that
those

take

in
which
someone
perhaps
the

buy

this

the

on
the

hand
the

can

since

doesn
t
go
in
the
reverse
direction
all
of
this
be
spell
out
in
the

that
accompany
the

of
the

b
when
there
be
more
demand
for
the
b
relative
to
supply
than
for
the

the
b
will
sell
at
roughly
of
the
price
of
a
when
there
s
a
lesser
demand
it
will
fall
to
a
discount
in
my
opinion
most
of
the
time
the
demand
for

will
be
such
that
it
will
trade
at
about

however
from
time
to
time
a
different
supply
demand
situation
will
prevail
and
the

will
sell
at
some
discount
in
my
opinion
again
when
the

be
at
a

you

why

than

use
for
operational
purpose
at
midamerican
and
the
few
left
over
at
gen
re
the
answer
be
simple
i
believe
each
contract
we
own
be
mispriced
at
inception
sometimes
dramatically
so
i
both
initiate
these
position
and
monitor
them
a
set
of
responsibility
consistent
with
my
belief
that
the
ceo
of
any
large
financial
organization
must
be
the
chief
risk
officer
as
well
if
we
lose
money
on
our
derivative
it
will
be
my
fault
our
derivative
dealing
require
our
counterparties
to
make
payment
to
us
when
contract
be
initiate
berkshire
therefore
always
hold
the
money
which
leaf
us
assume
no
meaningful
counterparty
risk
as
of
yearend
the
payment
make
to
us
less
loss
we
have
paid
our

float
so
to
speak
total
billion
this
float

if

it
be
far
from
a

be
that

at
the

closer

overall
our

now
have
an

with
the

the

we
have

on
these
contract
and
paid
loss
of
million
use
mark
to
market
principle
we
also
set
up
a
liability
for
future
loss
that
at
yearend
total
billion
thus
we
have
to
that
point
record
a
loss
of
about
million
derive
from
our
billion
total
in

and
estimate
future
loss
minus
the
billion
of
premium
we
receive
in
our
quarterly
report
however
the
amount
of
gain
or
loss
have
swung
wildly
from
a
profit
of
million
in
the
second
quarter
of
to
a
loss
of
million
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
surprisingly
we
make
payment
on
these
contract
of
only
million
last
year
far
below
the
estimate
i
use
when
i
decide
to
enter
into
them
this
year
however
loss
have
accelerate
sharply
with
the
mushroom
of
large
bankruptcy
in
last
year
s
letter
i
told
you
i
expect
these
contract
to
show
a
profit
at
expiration
now
with
the
recession
deepen
at
a
rapid
rate
the
possibility
of
an
eventual
loss
have
increase
whatever
the
result
i
will
keep
you
post
in
we
begin
to
write
credit
default
swap
on
individual
company
this
be
simply
credit
insurance
similar
to
what
we
write
in
bhac
except
that
here
we
bear
the
credit
risk
of
corporation
rather
than
of
tax
exempt
issuer
if
say
the
xyz
company
go
bankrupt
and
we
have
write
a
million
contract
we
be
obligate
to
pay
an
amount
that
reflect
the
shrinkage
in
value
of
a
comparable
amount
of
xyz
s
debt
if
for
example
the
company
s
bond
be
sell
for
after
default
we
would
owe
million
for
the
typical
contract
we
receive
quarterly
payment
for
five
year
after
which
our
insurance
expires
at
yearend
we
have
write
billion
of
contract
cover
corporation
for
which
we
receive
annual
premium
of
million
this
be
the
only
derivative
business
we
write
that
have
any
counterparty
risk
the
party
that
buy
the
contract
from
us
must
be
good
for
the
quarterly
premium
it
will
owe
us
over
the
five
year
we
be
unlikely
to
expand
this
business
to
any
extent
because
most
buyer
of
this
protection
now
insist
that
the
seller
post
collateral
and
we
will
not
enter
into
such
an
arrangement
at
the
request
of
our
customer
we
write
a
few
tax
exempt
bond
insurance
contract
that
be
similar
to
those
write
at
bhac
but
that
be
structure
as
derivative
the
only
meaningful
difference
between
the
two
contract
be
that
mark
to
market
accounting
be
require
for
derivative
whereas
standard
accrual
accounting
be
require
at
bhac
but
this
difference
can
produce
some
strange
result
the
bond
cover
in
effect
insured
by
these
derivative
be
largely
general
obligation
of
state
and
we
feel
good
about
them
at
yearend
however
mark
to
market
accounting
require
us
to
record
a
loss
of
million
on
these
derivative
contract
have
we
instead
insured
the
same
bond
at
the
same
price
in
bhac
and
use
the
accrual
accounting
require
at
insurance
company
we
would
have
record
a
small
profit
for
the
year
the
two
method
by
which
we
insure
the
bond
will
eventually
produce
the
same
accounting
result
in
the
short
term
however
the
variance
in
report

can
be
substantial

cause
big

here
be

perspective
on

you
can

we

word
if
the

we

record

the
difference
between
the

figure

i
believe
that

very
likely

april
i
saw
don
danly
as
i
come
in
would
he
come
up
there
he
be
i
see
him
come
on
up
because
we
have
to
straighten
thing
out
about
the
golf
ball
business
don
as
many
of
you
know
be
my
partner
in
the
wilson
coin
operate
machine
company
which
be
an
incredible
success
and
we
start
with
one
pinball
machine
which
we
put
over
at
frank
arago
s
barber
shop
and
we
built
the
route
to
seven
as
i
remember
include
a
huge
winner
down
by
griffith
stadium
we
be
bother
at
one
point
by
frank
actually
who
want
us
to
put
in
a
peanut
machine
and
we
didn
t
like
that
because
the
nice
thing
about
the
pinball
machine
business
be
it
be
a
nickel
thing
but
it
be
all
profit
there
be
no
cost
of
good
sell
whatsoever
whereas
peanut
you
have
to
actually
give
people
something
that
go
against
the
grain
but
then
frank
told
us
that
we
be
go
to
have
to
remove
our
pinball
machine
unless
we
put
in
a
peanut
machine
so
we
bought
a
northwestern
peanut
machine
for
about
buck
or
something
like
that
or
buck
and
we
bought
five
pound
of
spanish
peanut
as
i
remember
and
we
take
it
out
to
the
barber
shop
and
place
it
in
the
barber
shop
and
then
drove
back
to
my
house
and
my
mother
be
at
the
door
look
panicked
she
say
there
be
some
fellow
scream
on
the
phone
so
i
take
the
phone
and
i
couldn
t
completely
understand
it
but
i
figure
out
it
be
frank
and
i
thought
we
well
get
back
to
the
barber
shop
fast
so
we
go
back
to
the
barber
shop
we
have
now
be
in
the
peanut
business
probably
minute
there
be
a
fellow
there
bleeding
from
the
mouth
and
it
turn
out
that
the
peanut
machine
we
bought
have
some
little
glass
shaving
down
at
the
bottom
at
that
point
our
pinball
subsidiary
i
mean
our
peanut
machine
subsidiary
have
gross
revenue
of
one
penny
and
a
big
lawsuit
so
we
give
the
machine
to
frank
and
told
him
it
be
all
his
peanut
and
everything
but
then
they
mention
the
use
golf
ball
business
and
we
do
go
into
the
golf
ball
business
because
there
be
a
fellow
name
bob
kerlin
who
have
heard
rumor
from
us
of
our
incredible
success
in
the
pinball
business
so
he
want
to
go
into
our
next
deal
he
be
sort
of
like
an
ipo
free
rider
or
something
like
that
he
kept
insist
and
finally
we
decide
to
go
into
the
use
golf
ball
business
and
we
decide
to
make
kerlin
a
partner
and
you
will
see
why
in
a
second
because
our
idea
of
go
into
the
use
golf
ball
business
be
to
go
over
to
as
i
remember
a
course
over
in
virginia
we
would
go
out
early
in
the
morning
before
anybody
be
there
and
there
be
this
lake
and
we
be
go
to
retrieve
these
ball
from
the
lake
and
i
use
to
count
the
money
and
don
would
fix
the
machine
but
neither
one
of
us
want
to
go
into
that
damn
lake
so
we
decide
to
take
kerlin
in
as
a
full
fledge
one
third
partner
and
to
do
that
we
felt
we
want
to
buy
the
best
of
equipment
so
don
go
down
to
an
army
surplus
store
around
th
and
d
and
bought
a
gas
mask
and
we
hooked
that
up
to
a
garden
hose
and
we
test
it
in
about
three
inch
of
water
in
our
bathtub
to
see
whether
it
would
work
that
you
could
breathe
we
decide
that
be
enough
for
kerlin
then
we
have
to
make
sure
he
stayed
down
so
we
get
my
washington
post
newspaper
bag
and
we
stuck
in
a
bunch
of
barbell
plate
we
go
out
to
this
course
and
kerlin
strip
down
and
he
put
on
this
washington
post
thing
and
a
gas
mask
and
weight
down
by
plate
and
we
told
him
you
know
now
be
the
time
to
earn
your
third
of
the
deal
we
sent
him
into
this
lake
i
mean
don
be
the
guy
that
take
up
physic
and
chemistry
and
all
that
stuff
i
just
knew
how
to
count
money
but
he
forgot
to
think
about
what
would
happen
once
kerlin
get
underneath
and
couldn
t
see
a
damn
thing
and
he
be
have
trouble
breathing
and
then
just
about
this
time
the
guy
with
the
truck
come
along
who
be
go
to
fill
up
the
sand
trap
and
we
get
this
guy
on
this
hose
he
be
down
there
in
the
lake
we
start
pull
back
on
the
hose
try
to
get
him
back
and
then
the
man
stop
us
and
ask
us
what
we
be
do
i
m
not
sure
which
one
of
us
come
up
with
the
answer
that
we
be
do
an
experiment
for
our
physic
class
that
be
our
use
golf
ball
business
i
just
thought

be
entitle
to
the
full
story

will
save
the
rest
of
my
story
for

t

the
last
few
week
have
be
tough
time
for
all
of
us
in
our
personal
life
and
for
many
of
us
in
our
business
activity
at
berkshire
we
have
estimate
our
september
insurance
loss
be
billion
we
ve
label
this
a
guess
because
that
s
all
it
be
it
will
be
many
year
before
we
can
tell
the
world
within
a
narrow
range
what
the
true
figure
be
a
very
high
percentage
of
the
loss
occur
in
our
u
s
insurance
company
with
the
balance
in
german
and
u
k
entity
because
we
have
regularly
paid
very
large
amount
of
u
s
income
tax
we
will
bear
of
the
cost
applicable
to
the
u
s
operation
the
government
will
bear
many
insurer
will
not
have
their
loss
mitigate
in
this
manner
and
some
may
not
survive
though
much
of
our
loss
will
be
paid
very
soon
significant
payment
in
the
liability
area
will
take
a
considerable
time
to
settle
even
with
tax
recovery
our
loss
be
huge
nevertheless
it
s
one
berkshire
can
easily
bear
we
have
long
be
in
the
super
cat
business
and
we
have
be
prepared
both
financially
and
psychologically
to
handle
them
when
they
occur
this
won
t
be
our
last
hit
though
we
fervently
hope
disaster

the

arise

you

so
that
berkshire

i

sure
we

relatively
deep

that
s
a
division

that

in

if
you
wish
share
this
message
with
any
of
your
associate
in
at
a
time
when
the
scandal
of
the

the

of

e
buffett
date
september
the
five
most
dangerous
word
in
business
may
be
everybody
else
be
do
it
a
lot
of
bank
and
insurance
company
have
suffer
earnings
disaster
after
rely
on
that
rationale
even
bad
have
be
the
consequence
from
use
that
phrase
to
justify
the
morality
of
propose
action
more
than
company
so
far
have
be
drawn
into
the
stock
option
backdating
scandal
and
the
number
be
sure
to
go
high
my
guess
be
that
a
great
many
of
the
people
involve
would
not
have
behave
in
the
manner
they
do
except
for
the
fact
that
they
felt
others
be
do
so
as
well
the
same
go
for
all
of
the
accounting
gimmick
to
manipulate
earnings
and
deceive
investor
that
have
take
place
in
recent
year
you
would
have
be
happy
to
have
as
an
executor
of
your
will
or
your
son
in
law
most
of
the
people
who
engage
in
these
ill
conceive
activity
but
somewhere
along
the
line
they
picked
up
the
notion
perhaps
suggest
to
them
by
their
auditor
or
consultant
that
a
number
of
well
respect
manager
be
engage
in
such
practice
and
therefore
it
must
be
ok
to
do
so
it
s
a
seductive
argument
but
it
couldn
t
be
more
wrong
in
fact
every
time
you
hear
the
phrase
everybody
else
be
do
it
it
should
raise
a
huge
red
flag
why
would
somebody
offer
such
a
rationale
for
an
act
if
there
be
a
good
reason
available
clearly
the
advocate
harbor
at
least
a
small
doubt
about
the
act
if
he
utilizes
this
verbal
crutch
so
at
berkshire
let
s
start
with
what
be
legal
but
always
go
on
to
what
we
would
feel
comfortable
about
be
print
on
the
front
page
of
our
local
paper
and
never
proceed
forward
simply
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
other
people
be
do
it
a
final
note
somebody
be
do
something
today
at
berkshire
that
you
and
i
would
be
unhappy
about
if
we
knew
of
it
that
s
inevitable
we
now
employ
well
over
people
and
the
chance
of
that
number
get
through
the
day
without
any
bad
behavior
occur
be
nil
but
we
can
have
a
huge
effect
in
minimize
such
activity
by
jumping
on
anything
immediately
when
there
be
the
slightest
odor
of
impropriety
your
attitude
on
such
matter
express
by
behavior
as
well
as
word
will
be
the
most
important
factor
in
how
the
culture
of
your
business
develops
and
culture
more
than

determines
how

the
buffett

would
and
that
would
productively
use
my

now
the
large
answer

that
over

i
have
gotten

well
spent
a

with

they

with

i
ve
see
them
give

to

of
people
around
the

and
bill

melinda
be
bent
on
reduce
that
inequity
to
the
extent
they
possibly
can
if
you
think
about
it
if
your
goal
be
to
return
the
money
to

by
attack
truly
major
problem
that
don
t
have
a
commensurate

what
could
you
find
that
s
well
than
turn
to
a
couple
of
people
who
be
young
who
be
ungodly
bright
whose
idea
have
be
proven
who
already
have
show
an
ability
to
scale
it
up
and
do
it
right
you
don
t
get
an
opportunity
like
that
ordinarily
i
m
get
two
people
enormously
successful
at
something
where
i
ve
have
a
chance
to
see
what
they
ve
do
where
i
know
they
will
keep
do
it
where
they
ve
do
it
with
their
own
money
so
they
re
not
living
in
some
fantasy
world
and
where
in
general
i
agree
with
their
reason
if
i
ve
found
the
right
vehicle
for
my
goal
there
s
no
reason
to
wait
compare
what
i
m
do
with
them
to
my
situation
at
berkshire
where
i
have
talented
and
proven
people
in
charge
of
our
business
they
do
a
much
well
job
than
i
could
in
run
their
operation
what
can
be
more
logical
in
whatever
you
want
do
than
find
someone
well
equip
than
you

do
it

there
as
well
simply
put
buffett

his
reason
for

be
because
i
ve
get
some
people
who
can
give
it
away
well
than
i
can
one
of
the
few
dictate
buffett
give
to
the

be
that
his

quote
as
say
yeah
i
m
glad
warren
buffett
come
this
year
because
you
know
first
of
all
he
s
a
great
example
a
philanthropist
when
he
give
his
money
he
give
it
to
bill
gate
s
foundation
and
i
call
him
and
i
thanked
him
and
i
say
warren
what
s
the
deal
here
he
say
well
you
know
i
could
build
a
monument
to
myself
but
i
make
all
this
money
because
people
thought
i
could
make
money
well
with
their
money
than
they
could
and
he
say
they
be
right
but
he
say
bill
gate
can
spend
my
money
well
than
i
could
and
he
say
it
s
really
crazy
it
s
wrong
for
me
not
to
do
this
so
i
think
not
only
do
i
find
him
a
delightful
man
but
he
set
an
example
that
we
should
all
remember
that
none
of
it
s
about
our
ego
it
s
about
the
most
effective
way
to
invest
whatever
money
or
time
we
have
so
i
m
especially
glad
that
he
come
in
the
gate
foundation
say
that
all
its
asset
be
to
be
spent
within

as
much
as
possible
as
soon
as
possible
american
be
become
more
philanthropically
aware

say
bloomberg

the
real
question
about

about

to
spend

ring
because
that
s
what
buffett
spent
at
the
time
of
his
first
marriage
so
do
buffett
spend

apparently

one

that
the

it
will
deserve
a
little
more

since

in

to
the

s
hope
that
berkshire
will
rise
fold
over
the
next
dozen

as
it
have
at
time
in
the

the

close
at
on

make
buffett
one
of
a
few
ceo
who
say
his
stock
price
and
salary
be
the
same
buffett
told
cnbc
october
that
he
never
split
berkshire
a
share
because
then
he
would
have
to
take
a
pay
cut
he
say
tongue
in
cheek
he
and
the
board
have
a
deal
that
he
get
paid
the
amount
of
one
share
so
if
the
stock
be
i
get
paid
if
you
split
hundred
for
one
my
salary
would
go
down
to
a
measly
a
year
he
joked
it
have
be
a
long
and
wind
road
since
buffett
form
his
partnership
in
but
for
now
be
now
worth
at
least
million
at
the
end
of
berkshire
s
stock
price
be
quite
a
journey
quite
an
odyssey
back
to
the
world
s
financial
meltdown
caught
up
with
berkshire
in
and
the
stock
fell
on
november
to
but
close
at
and
then
hit
a
low
of
on
march
before
closing
at
on
august
the
stock
go
back
and
forth
over
the
line
so
many
time
in
that
maybe
buffett
think
he
get
paid
for
the
number
of
time
berkshire
cross
the

perked
up

plunge
back

at
exactly
meaning
the

back
to
a

a
stock
buyback
at
with
berkshire
trading
at
about
book
value
buffett
clearly
felt
the
stock
be
undervalue
and
say
so
on
september
when
he
announce
an
authorization
for
a
stock
buyback
the
first
in
berkshire
s
history
the
share
repurchase
authorization
for
both
the
a
and
b
share
come
as
the
board
decide
the
underlie
business
of
berkshire
be
worth
considerably
more
than
where
the
stock
be
trading
when
buffett
us
a
word
like
considerably
he
mean
well
considerably
the
company
say
in
a
statement
it
plan
to
buy
back
share
up
to
a
premium
to
the
then
current
book
value
so
buffett
be
willing
to
pay
cent
for
a
dollar
of
book
value
and
he
have
say
berkshire
be
worth
more
than
book
value
if
we
be
correct
in
our
opinion
repurchase
will
enhance
the
per
share
intrinsic
value
of
berkshire
share
benefiting
shareholder
who
retain
their
interest
that
s
because
buying

back
into
the
company
give
the
remain
shareholder
a
large
proportionate
share
of
the
company
s
profit
berkshire
stock
have
be
trading
down
all
year
apparently
for
a
variety
of
reason
range
from
succession
concern
a
dour
stock
market
and
a
sluggish
economy
in
the
statement
berkshire
say
the
buyback
would
be
with
available
cash
on
hand
but
that
berkshire
s
cash
position
would
not
fall
below
billion
berkshire
plan
to
buy
the
share
in
the
open
market
or
through
negotiate
private
purchase
no
price
for
the
purchase
be
set
for
the

which
be
to
last
indefinitely
the
stock
jumped
about
on
first
word
of
the
buyback
and
end
up
for
the
day
approach
the
price
of
above
of
book
value
in
the
past
buffett
have
generally
shun
buyback
for
berkshire
say
that
if

crowd
i
tell
them
that
i
benefit
from
the
great
teacher
in
the
history
of
finance
my
role
model
ben
graham
ben
taught
his
student
at
columbia
that
stock
be
not
figure
that
float
on
the
tickertape
but
be
piece
of
living
business
ben
taught
his
student
to
stay
within
their
circle
of
competence
when
evaluate
business
concern
and
to
allow
a
margin
of
safety
in
their
evaluation
and
in
the
purchase
price
they
pay
remember
you
get
no
bargain
by
overpay
ben
s
student
learn
it
right
in
apply
ben
s
guide
principle
charlie
and
i
try
to
be
thorough
and
methodical
we
must
also
be
realistic
we
look
for
a
business
we
can
understand
where
we
re
familiar
with
the
product
the
nature
of
the
competition
and
what
might
go
wrong
over
time
we
search
around
the
corner
whether
the
economics
of
the
business
include
its
earn
power
over
the
next
or
year
be
likely
to
resemble
a
fine
wine
to
be
good
and
get
well
then
we
decide
whether
we
would
be
buying
into
a
business
manage
by
people
we
feel
comfortable
be
in
business
with
people
with
intelligence
energy
and
most
importantly
integrity
though
this
business
evaluation
process
may
sound
straightforward
it
s
far
from
easy
try
it
at
home
at
your
kitchen
table
it
hasn
t
hurt
that
charlie
and
i
have
a
few
more
gray
hair
this
year
and
have
reach
an
age
where
as
spinoza
say
we
prefer
what
be
old
and
safe
to
what
be
new
and
dangerous
name
like
see

and
the

make
our

in

we

our

change
much
so

a
moment
ago
for
a
reason
at
this
time
near
mid
century
berkshire
be
ready
to
launch
its
great
product
sendoff
ever
the
press
get
it
only
partially
right
when
it
report
the
acquisition
of
more
acreage
for
the
expand
berkshire
product
launch
center
in
orlando
well
orlando
be
our
main
u
s
location
but
ephesus
will
continue
to
be
the
global
center
charlie
and
i
figure
if
a
center
of
ancient
civilization
be
good
enough
for
the
virgin
mary
then
in
our
admittedly
humble
and
secular
way
it
should
be
good
enough
for
the
global
berkshire
product
launch
center
accord
to
legend
the
virgin
mary
live
within
walk
distance
of
our
global
launch
center
they
didn
t
have
car
then
but
they
didn
t
know
that
yet
although
i
m
know
as
an
agnostic
occasionally
i
do
like
to
hedge
my
bet
so
i
remind
you
of
the
see
s
fight
song
what
a
friend
we
have
in
jesus
see
s
of
course
book
most
of
its
revenue
from
christmas
to
easter
the
only
way
mary
could
have
do
well
for
see

business
would
have
be
to
have
