roy
jones
the
two
top
officer

that
be
now
go
on
in
france
in

brock
remind
them
the
only
rational
thing
be
to
throw
all
of
your
strength
and
all
of
your
resource
into
it
there
be
more
to
brock
s
new
strategy
than
tough
talk
he
order
stephen
ladas
a
greek
born
harvard
educate
lawyer
who
work
with
export
in
new
york
to
fly
to
paris
with
reinforcement
makinsky
s
old
world
approach
wasn
t
work
perhaps
it
be
time
for
something
simple
and
direct
brock
give
ladas
explicit
write
instruction
to
spend
whatever
amount
of
money
it
take
to
enlist
as
many
soldier
as
he
need
to
turn
the
tide
ladas
have
one
week
to
plan
the
trip
and
select
his
target
it
may
be
that
we
should
hire
a
half
dozen
or
more
influential
scientist
brock
write
ladas
it
may
be
that
our
lawyer
should
associate
one
or
three
more
lawyer
it
be
possible
that
one
or
a
half
dozen
political
leader
could
be
engage
to
do
legitimate
work
for
us
on
the
phone
with
ladas
brock
suggest
other
avenue
of
approach
too
sensitive
to
commit
to
paper
and
make
it
clear
there
be
no
upper
limit
on
the
blank
check
this
be
no
penny
ante
game
brock
warn
it
be
the
decisive
struggle
in
europe
at
first
glance
steve
ladas
be
an
odd
choice
for
the
french
assignment
shy
and
bookish
his
specialty
be
international
trademark
law
not
cloak
and
dagger
work
he
struck
some
of
his
colleague
as
a
bit
naive
coca
cola
men
who
work
in
south
america
chuckle
over
his
habit
of
introduce
himself
formally
by
his
full
name
stephen
p
ladas
which
make
it
sound
as
if
his
family
name
be
peladas
slang
in
spanish
for
naked
brock
told
ladas
he
d
picked
him
because
he
be
smart
enough
to
improvise
in
the
field
but
a
well
guess
be
that
ladas
be
the
only
one
at
export
brock
trust
with
the
company
s
money
ladas
land
in
paris
on
the
morning
of
monday
february
in
the
era
of
the
lockheed
constellation
an
overnight
flight
from
new
york
take
sixteen
or
seventeen
hour
include
the
refuel
stop
at
gander
newfoundland
with
the
noisy
drone
of
the
engine
and
ceaseless
vibration
of
the
propeller
passenger
generally
arrive
exhaust
but
ladas
full
of
fight
mood
in
his
own
word
press
ahead
with
a
busy
schedule
with
makinsky
off
in
algiers
finagle
a
delay
in
the
trial
of
the
coca
cola
bottler
there
ladas
be
on
his
own
his
first
order
of
business
be
to
see
the
leader
of
the
various
beverage
industry
experience
in
the
united
state
and
elsewhere
have
demonstrate
that
coke
do
not
undercut
the
sale
of
other
drink
certainly
not
liquor
it
be
simply
absurd
to
think
that
an
american
soft
drink
sell
at
eight
cent
for
ounce
be
about
to
wean
the
french
away
from
their
beloved
red
table
wine
which
they
could
buy
for
fifteen
cent
per
liter
yet
no
amount
of
persuasion
have
make
the
slightest
impression
so
coca
cola
want
to
strike
a
deal
ladas
described
one
of
his
call
he
arrive
at
the
office
of
the
radical
socialist
party
where
he
be
greet
by
a
mr
rolland
in
spite
of
its
name
the
party
be
actually
slightly
right
of
center
and
it
represent
some
of
the
country
s
wine
interest
ladas
repeat
the
familiar
reassurance
which
fell
as
usual
upon
deaf
ear
and
then
ask
if
there
be
anything
the
coca
cola
company
could
do
to
appease
the
vintner
rolland
pause
perhaps
there
be
he
reply
the
u
s
tariff
on
french
wine
be
too
high
it
would
be
good
to
cut
it
in
half
and
the
red
tape
at
the
u
s
food
and
drug
administration
be
impossible
french
winemaker
would
appreciate
have
direct
access
to
american
market
very
well
ladas
say
the
coca
cola
company
be
prepared
to
spend
to
engage
a
lobbying
firm
in
the
united
state
to
pursue
those
very
goal
if
the
wine
interest
would
call
off
the
attack
there
might
be
more
help
down
the
road
rolland
shook
his
head
no
he
be
polite
but
firm
a
generous
gesture
by
coca
cola
would
be
welcome
naturally
but
he
would
have
to
insist
on
see
some
result
before
make
any
commitment
meanwhile
the

indeed

make
its

what
the

forgot
be
that
coca

be
more
than
a

more
than
a

four

the

appeal

almost
everyone
could
afford

anyone
who
get
thirsty
during

the

find

there

they

at

they
have
found
another

commercially
kola
burst
upon
the

who
mail

in

nut
as
the
seed
be
popularly
misidentified
begin
make
claim
on
behalf
of
their
discovery
that
be
even
more
elaborate
than
those
put
forward
for
cocaine
the
problem
however
be
that
the
kola
nut
s
active
ingredient
turn
out
to
be
caffeine
unlike
cocaine
which
prove
to
be
quite
a
potent
drug
indeed
kola
have
no
great
curative
power
than
a
cup
of
tea
in
spite
of
the
ardent
promotion
and
exaggeration
of
die
hard
believer
kola
fail
to
catch
on
with
the
public
as
a
remedy
but
pemberton
have
an
inspiration
his
idea
as
he
heat
and
stir
the
content
of
his
brass
kettle
in
the
spring
of
be
to
create
a
soft
drink
with
extract
of
kola
as
its
base
a
soft
drink
that
could
in
theory
compete
with
tea
and
coffee
in
the
hot
south
a
cool
carbonate
substitute
for
the
traditionally
hot
caffeine
beverage
just
might
make
a
fortune
the
stumble
block
pemberton
found
be
that
liquid
extract
of
kola
be
extremely
bitter
and
astringent
noticeable
and
disagreeable
even
in
tiny
amount
he
conduct
extensive
trial
and
error
experiment
but
one
associate
who
visit
regularly
during
that
period
recall
that
the
result
he
sample
be
an
awful
mixture
there
simply
be
no
way
to
put
in
enough
kola
extract
to
have
an
effective
amount
of
caffeine
without
make
a
syrup
that
curl
people
s
lip
people
might
accept
and
even
appreciate
foul
taste
in
a
medicine
but
not
in
a
beverage
eventually
as
the
week
pass
pemberton
give
up
on
kola
extract
and
begin
work
on
a
different
approach
his
breakthrough
come
when
he
try
cut
the
amount
of
kola
extract
in
the
syrup
to
a
tiny
drop
and
substitute
synthetic
caffeine
in
its
place
pure
caffeine
in
the
form
of
a
dry
white
powder
come
from
several
natural
source
tea
coffee
kola
and
cocoa
for
example
and
in
pemberton
s
case
he
turn
to
the
german
pharmaceutical
house
merck
for
caffeine
obtain
by
remove
the
starch
gum
resin
and
other
constituent
element
from
kola
the
synthetic
caffeine
be
bitter
too
but
not
nearly
so
overpower
as
the
kola
extract
pemberton
discover
that
he
could
mask
the
taste
of
the
caffeine
with
sugar
and
other
ingredient
and
he
begin
refining
a
recipe
that
would
please
or
at
least
not
assault
the
nostril
at
last
he
stood
on
the
verge
of
invent
coca
cola
down
in
the
basement
of
the
holland
house
pemberton
fill
his
forty
gallon
kettle
with
plain
water
which
he
then
heat
to
a
boil
over
an
open
fire
use
a
wooden
paddle
to
stir
the
solution
he
melt
in
sugar
and
caffeine
next
he
add
caramel
for
color
give
the
syrup
its
dark
distinctive
port
wine
color
to
balance
the
sweetness
of
the
sugar
and
give
the
syrup
its
tang
he
add
lime
juice
citric
acid
and
phosphoric
acid
then
as
the
basic
blend
cool
pemberton
turn
to
the
question
of
flavor
into
the
mix
go
vanilla
extract
elixir
of

several
pungent

pemberton
add
to
this
brew
the

exactly
how
much
cocaine
go
into
the
inaugural

be
impossible
to
calculate
more
than

even
a
touch
of
the

he
believe
coca

it
have
an
appeal
taste
although
some
say
you
have

anyone
it
be

right
and
it
could
be
sell
not
just
once
in
a
while
but
over
and
over
again
several
time
a
day
its
only
shortcoming
be
that
few
people

or
even
that
it
exist
there
be
no

corner
in
the
hot
sun
robinson
spill
out
his
story
and
urge
candler
to
take
the
case
candler
just
twenty
five
year
old
but
already
a
prominent
attorney
in

do
not
see
much
hope
he
knew
doc
pemberton
and
be
fond
of
him
but
he
also
knew
pemberton
s
reputation
in
business
nevertheless
he
agree
to
go
see
pemberton
on
robinson

behalf
i
found
him
lie
on
a

later
not
under
cover
but
his
coat

very
well
his

and
i
go
in
to
see
him
and
told
him
what
they
have
say
pemberton
listen
quietly
while
candler
laid
out
robinson
s
and
holland
s
case
yes
pemberton
admit
he
have

chemical
robinson
and
holland
he
insist
own
no
part
of

then
he
add
bleakly
it
don
t
make
much
difference
though
even
if
they

have
any
right

don

day
or
two
later
candler
show
robinson
into
his
office
and
explain
that
it
be
pointless
to
proceed
there

no
lawsuit
because
there
be
no
asset
to
recover
pemberton
be
penniless

to
be
greet
the

with
serious
moral
purpose
and
perhaps
even
a
touch
of
parsimony
in

heart
his
eye
take
on
an
icy
glint
he
be

yet
he
have
a
command

and
he
make
men

him
candler
brought
frank
robinson
into
the

have
be
swamp
with
complaint
from

that
the

turn
rancid
in

because
it
lack
an
adequate

coca

syrup
be
highly
unstable
among
other
thing
it
have
a
tendency
to
begin
ferment
in
addition
pemberton
have
use
tin
can
as
well
as
glass
jar
to
market
it
and
the
tin
provoke
a
chemical
reaction
with
the
phosphoric
acid
experiment
together
robinson
and
candler
add
glycerine
to
the
mix
and
found
that
it
work
effectively
as
a
preservative
and
smooth
agent
they
get
rid
of
the
tin
can
then
they
begin
tinker
with
the
two
name
ingredient
coca
and
cola
each
present
a
problem
the
first
stirring
of
a
national
debate
have
begin
over
the
negative
aspect
of

and
manufacturer
be
grow
defensive
over
charge
that
use
of
their
product
might
lead
to
cocainism
or
the
cocaine
habit
the
full
throated
fury
against
cocaine
be
still
a
few
year
off
and
candler
and
robinson
be
anxious
to
continue
promote
the
suppose
health
benefit
of
the
coca
leaf
but
there
be
no
reason
to
risk
put
more
than
a
tiny
bit
of
coca
extract
in
their
syrup
they
cut
the
amount
to
a
mere
trace
with
extract
of
kola
the
difficulty
be
the
taste
even
with
the
tiny
quantity
pemberton
use
the
bitterness
be
still
noticeable
and
still
disagreeable
not
only
that
it
be
expensive
the
dry
nut
cost
per
pound
on
the
wharf
in
new
york
so
the
extract
of
kola
be
cut
to
a
minuscule
amount
as
well
candler
and
robinson
found
themselves
in
the
interest
position
of
prepare
to
market
a
product
that
contain
very
little
of
either
ingredient
in
its
trademark
an
irony
that
would
have
profound
legal
implication
and
shape
an
entire
beverage
industry
in
the
year
to
come
in
the
interest
of

candler
and
robinson
stop
refer
to
the

in
their
new
formula
by

instead

the

next
candler
tidy
up
his
chain
of
title
buying
out
the
final
one
third
share
of
the

held
by
pemberton
s
old
salesman
woolfolk
walker
and
his
sister
mr

candler
paid

bade
a

era
by

for
hot
spring
arkansas
without
say
good
bye
or
pay
his
sister
back
on
may
at
the
start
of
the
soda
fountain
season
candler
ran
a
big
ad
in
the
atlanta
journal
proclaim
his
company
sole
proprietor
of
coca
cola
everything
seem
to
be
in
place
yet
the
success
of
coca
cola
be
still
far
from
assure
and
one
reason
be
that
candler
have
his
doubt
about
the
appeal
of
the
product
he
be
never
entirely
sure
whether
to
advertise
it
as
a
simple
refreshment
or
a
curative
patent
medicine
and
so
he
try
both
often
in
the
same
ad
coca
cola
be
delicious
and
refresh
and
at
the
same
time
it
be
a
brain
tonic
and
nerve
stimulant
mostly
candler
retreat
to
the
familiar
try
and
untrue
patter
of
patent
medicine
he
be
very
much
a
man
of
his
time
and
he
be
comfortable
with
the
old
fashion
hyperbole
of
his
craft
in
a
brochure
he
sent
to
druggist
candler
tout
his
top
product
botanic
blood

by

when

a
trial
and
you
will
at
once
begin
to
grow
well
and
strong
he
take
a
similar
tack
with
coca
cola
the
same
brochure
contain
druggist
endorsement
of
coca
cola
as
a
cure
for
insomnia
neuralgia
headache
and
mental
fatigue
and
candler
even
echoed
the
claim
of
the
old
french
wine
of
coca
by
promising
relief
where
the
voice

have
to
have

a

so
in

it

time
to
incorporate

candler
s
idea
be
to
keep
half
the

sell
the

half
to
major
wholesaler
in

would

early

as

the
corporation
issue
share
with
a
value
of
apiece
and
candler
take
exactly
half
he
give
ten
share
to
frank
robinson
and
then
offer
the
other
share
for
sale
through
stock
broker
in
baltimore
new
york
boston
and
other
city
have
all
go
accord
to
plan
candler
would
have
raise
in
fresh
capital
but
there
be
a
problem
coca
cola
be
a
southern
phenomenon
virtually
unknown
up
north
and
no
one
seem
to
want
to
take
the
risk
only

he

to

the

they
might

there

however
the

small
that
it

be
simply
impossible
for
anyone
to
form
the
cocaine
habit
from
drinking
coca

for
it
would
require
about
thirty
glass
as
usually
drawn
from
the

to
make
an
ordinary
dose
of
the

the
slack
report
present
candler
with
a
challenge
he
and
robinson
figure
they
have
remove
the
cocaine
from
coca
cola
or
at
least
reduce
it
to
an
undetectable
trace
when
they
modify
the
formula
three
year
earlier
it
now
seem
that
no
matter
how
drastically
they
cut
back
the
fluid
extract
of
coca
leaf
in
the

a
sophisticated
chemical
analysis
would
find
a
bit
of
cocaine
and
not
just
a
completely
innocent
bit
an
ordinary
dose
of
cocaine
as
define
by
most
pharmacist
at
the
time
be
one
full
grain
if
coca
cola
have
one
thirtieth
of

it
meant
that
heavy
coca
cola
drinker
might
might
feel
some

after

candler
could
not
afford
the
risk
of
put
even
a

certainly
not
when
woman

be
among

many

but
neither
could
candler
take
the
simple
step
of
eliminate
the
fluid

of
coca
leaf
from
the

candler
believe
that
his
product
s
name
have
to
be
descriptive
and
that
he
must
have
at
least
some
byproduct
of
the
coca
leaf
in
the

along
with
some
kola
to
protect
his
right
to

the

be
critical
candler
have
no
patent
on
the

itself
anyone
could
make
an
imitation
but
no
one
could
put
the
label
coca
cola
on
an

so
long
as
candler
own
the

the

the
thing
of
real
value
and
the

safeguard
coca

far
as
candler
could
tell
coca

be
now
entirely
free
of

and
he
might
have
be
well

candler
want

for
some
reason
candler
could
never
bring
himself
to

the
suggestive
overblown
language
of
the
early
promotion
for
coca

as
patent
medicine
in
his
sample
letter
candler
write
that
coca

be
a

combination
of

christian
soldier
bent

he
try
to
have
it
both
way
he
be
quick
to
denounce
accusation
that
coca
cola
be
addictive
as
you
doubtless
know
he
write
a
preacher
i
do
not
propose
to

he
told
the

he
would

the

on
the
spot
if
anyone
could
authenticate
a

case
of

addiction
yet
there
be
no
flat
denial
no
categorical
statement
that
coca

be
free
from
cocaine
and
no
retreat
from
the

barker

spiel
candler
insinuate
that
his
soft

have
curative
perhaps
even
intoxicate
power
when
it
do
not
and
people

him

vehemently
disagreed
during
the
three
year
life
of
the

he
grudgingly
ponied
up
and
paid
the

then
even
before
the
formal
repeal
of

in
he
sue
to
get
back
every
penny
with
interest
sue
the
federal
government
be
a
risky
proposition
and
candler
knew
it
from
a
strictly
financial
point
of
view
it
be
absurd
in
december
candler
have
stood
on
the
step
in

of

let

not
have
hurt
a
bit
especially
since
the

temporary
but
candler
s
personality
come
into
play
and
one
incident
in
particular
from
the
period
may
explain
how
his
mind
work
candler
s
eldest
son
howard
who

for
the

the
matter

his
father

candler
sent

i
have
never

in

after

candler
write
the
man
be
to

but
only
if
there
be
indubitable
evidence
and
independent
corroboration
of
howard
s
accusation
against
him
candler
would
not

take
his

for
it
the

to
make
a
judgment
of

fitness
and
report
back
and
there
be
a
final
instruction
the
report
candler
insist
firmly
should
be
limited
to
a
day
wire
of
not
more
than
word
candler
in
short
be
upright
fair
mind
and
also
incredibly
tightfisted
he
simply
could
not
bear
the
thought
of
part
with
money
he
believe
be
rightfully
his
candler
file
suit
in
federal
court
in

the

no
time
in
respond
the

company
be
incorporate
for
the
purpose
of
sell
medicine
the

the

it

the

accusation

potentially
the
most
dramatic
and
damage
of
the

claim

it
also
turn
out

candler

that

of
water

the

candler
admit
under

that

it
probably
be
candler
say
a
very
small
trace
of
it
yes
sir
what
have
happen
in
a
wondrous
twist
of
fate
be
that
the
coca
cola
company
have
prepared
for
trial
by
hire
an
expert
witness
of
its
own
to
rebut
the
evidence
and
testimony
the
government
be
expect
to
present
no
one
at
the
company
dream
that
the
government
would
come
up
short
nor
of
course
do
they
anticipate
that
their
own
man
dr
george
f
payne
the
secretary
of
the
georgia
state
board
of
pharmacy
would
discover
that
there
be
still
a
trace
of
cocaine
in
the
syrup
but
he
do
use
sophisticated
technique
that
apparently
be
unavailable
or
unknown
to
his
federal
counterpart
dr
payne
calculate
that
coca
cola
syrup
contain
one
th
of
a
grain
of
cocaine
per
ounce
it
be
the
mere
trace
he
testify
at
the
trial
not
enough
to
have
any
appreciable
effect
a
man
would
explode
before
he
could
drink
enough
to
affect
him
the
expert
testimony
at
the
trial
quickly
shift
to
speculation
about
the
possibility
of
the
trace
of
cocaine
make
coca
cola
genuinely
dangerous
to
public
health
dr
payne
thought
it
would
take
a
hundred
glass
of
coca
cola
before
a
consumer
could
feel
any
effect
from
the
cocaine
candler
double
the
figure
say
it
would
take
two
hundred
glass
the
government
put
up
dr
j
p
baird
president
of
the
medical
association
of
georgia
who
testify
that
coca
cola
definitely
be
habit
form
person
who
take
it
freely
he
say
seem
to
become
more
or
less
dependent
on
it
but
the
cocaine
he
add
deflate
his
thesis
couldn
t
be
the
cause
of
the
addiction
because
there
be
too
little
of
it
at
last
the
government
s
lead
chemist
dr
crampton
step
into
the
witness
chair
coca
cola
syrup
be
mostly
sugar
and
water
he
testify
but
it
also
have
cocaine
how
much
he
be
ask
a
small
amount
he
answer
vaguely
when
the
company
s
lawyer
confront
him
during
cross
examination
and
accuse
him
of
fail
to
detect
any
cocaine
at
all
dr
crampton
s
testimony
quickly
disintegrate
into
a
hodgepodge
of
fragmentary
answer
he
insist
contrary
to
well
establish
fact
that
the
only
way
to
test
for
the
presence
of
cocaine
be
by
taste
it
and
feel
the
result
on
the
tongue
there
be
no
accurate
test
he
insist
other
than
the
effect
upon
the
system
and
have
he
conduct
such
a
test
yes
he
say
he
have
boil
down
a
quart
or
at
least
part
of
a
quart
of
coca
cola
syrup
add
and
extract
various
solvent
and
then
test
the
result
on
his
tongue
he
imply
but
never
explicitly
state
that
his
tongue
be
numbed
by
the
residue
of
the
coca
cola
syrup
then
he
abruptly
left
the
stand
dismiss
by
both
side
there
be
nothing
in
the
trial
record
to
explain
dr
crampton
s
partial
and
confuse
testimony
one
plausible
theory
be
that
he
be
an
embarrassment
to
both
side
and
that
the
lawyer
decide
the
best
legal
strategy
would
be
to
hurry
him
out
of
the
courtroom
in
any
event
it
would
not
have
matter
very
much
the
jury
of
twelve
loyal
georgian
found
in
favor
of
the
coca
cola
company
during
scant
deliberation
that
last
less
than
fifteen
minute
except
that
dr
crampton
s
testimony
be
revive
several
time
in
subsequent
trial
and
even
found
its
way
into
a
landmark

supreme

opinion
write
year
later
by
oliver
wendell

dr

misremember
as
convincing
evidence
that
coca
cola
once
contain
enough
cocaine
to
numb
a
man
s
tongue
and
the
vivid
notion
quickly
found
its
way
into
the
public
consciousness
and
later
into
history
book
candler
get
his
back
but
the
cost
be
high
he
believe
the
government
s
true
purpose
be
to
punish
him
by
learn
the
formula
of
coca
cola
and
expose
it
to
the
would
be
imitator
of
the
world
who
would
then
flood
the
market
with
cheap
substitute
actually
there
already
be
plenty
of
imitator
at
work
and
they
do
not
need
the
revelation
in
the
courtroom
to
brew
up
syrup
that
closely
resemble
coca
cola
if
anything
the
trial
probably
confuse

for

reason
i
can

understand
he

his

there
seem
to
be
an

we

have

physician
that
a

have
be
driven

by

we
give
the
case
the
closest
investigation
and
found
what
we
expect
that
the
fellow
be
a
constant
drinker
of
liquor
and
tea
a
user
of
cigarette
generally
an
excessively
self
indulgent
man
in
the
habit
of
drinking
coca

early
on
sunday
morning
to
relieve
him
from
the
effect
of
a
saturday
and
sunday
debauch
our
great
danger
now
be
that
our
enemy
will
succeed
in
have
a

prohibit
the

of
coca
cola
for
help
candler
turn
to
the
big
cocaine
manufacturer
in
the
united
state
it
seem
an
ironic
choice
but
candler
figure
that
an
expert
in
extract
cocaine
from
coca
leaf
might
know
how
to
extract
all
the
cocaine
leave
a
residue
safe
enough
to
put
in
coca
cola
in
june
candler
board
a
train
for
new
york
go
to
the
office
of
the
roessler
hasslacher
chemical
company
and
put
a
challenge
to
their
top
supplier
dr
louis
schaefer
could
he
produce
an
extract
of
coca
from
which
every
vestige
of
cocaine
be
remove
yes
dr
schaefer
say
he
believe
he
could
schaefer
a
german
emigr
set
up
a
special
operation
at
the
schaefer
alkaloid
work
one
of
the
four
chemical
production
laboratory
he
have
open
in
maywood
new
jersey
in
the
s
in
make
the
new
merchandise
no
schaefer
create
a
process
that
be
in
a
word
thorough
he
begin
by
powder
the
coca
leaf
mix
them
with
sawdust
and
soak
the
compound
in
a
bicarbonate
of
soda
next
he
percolate
the
compound
with
toluene
a
powerful
solvent
derive
from
coal
tar
and
then
he
blast
the
treat
leaf
with
live
steam
finally
he
add
in
powder
kola
nut
exhaust
the
mixture
with
alcohol
and
finish
up
by
pasteurize
the
result
it
seem
unlikely
that
cocaine
or
anything
else
for
that
matter
could
survive
from
candler
s
point

his

the
tone
of

menace
he
complain
bitterly
that
he
have
not

allow
enough
time
to
assemble
evidence
that
the

in

hazardous
and
he
make
it
clear
that
he
intend
to
continue
until
he
have
do
so
he
also
spice
the

with

accusation
that

that
drove
them
crazy
reading

be
livid
it
be
he
huffed
the
most
unmistakable
evidence
to
me
of
his
unfitness
for
so
important
an
office
as
he
be
occupy
the
idea
of
his
send
a
man
over
the
country
pick
up
such
rumor
as
he
refers
to
and
then
use
them
in
an
official
order
be
enough
to
stagger
the
patriotism
of
a
well
man
than
myself
still
candler
content
himself
that
the
army
ban
be
lift
and
he
figure
people
would
forget
about
the
controversy
soon
enough
the
rest
of
the
family
urge
him
to
publicize
the
report

finding

advertise

he
demur
the
less

he
explain
the
more
likely
wiley
s
bruise
feeling
would
be
soothe
and
the
sooner
he
might
drop
the
matter
candler
could
not
have
be
more
mistaken
in
the
aftermath
of
his
skirmish
with
wiley
asa
candler
begin
weary
of
the

of

the

make
candler
the
richest
man
in
atlanta
the
city
s
historian
franklin
garrett
could
recall
hearing
little
boy
say
who
do
you
think
i
be
asa
g
candler
as
they
spurn
their
friend
request
to
borrow
a
dime
or
a
quarter
just
as
john
d
rockefeller
s
name
be
invoked
as
the
synonym
for
unimaginable
wealth
elsewhere
in
the

candler
s
be
in
georgia
yet
he
take
little
satisfaction
from
his
fabulous
financial
success
the
business
candler
say
dismissively
be
nothing
more
than
a
mere
money
get
machine
as
befit
a
devout
methodist
and
sunday
school
teacher
candler
have
a
sort
of
old
testament
ferocity
about
the
temptation
of
wealth
don
t
indulge
self
he
admonish
his
child
he
be
a
tyrant
never
satisfied
others
might
revel
in
buying
fashionable
clothes
or
get
ticket
to
the
late
show
candler
once
write
but
i
have
not
arrive
to
be
stylish
he
be
notoriously
frugal
when
mail
arrive
at
the
office
candler
would
slit
the
envelope
unfold
them
and
save
them
for
scratch
paper
and
he
apply
that
frugality
as
earnestly
to
himself
as
he
do
to
others
yet
candler
be
no
simple
miser
he
do
not
believe
it
be
entirely
proper
to
save
his
wealth
either
i
never
keep
money
he
once
explain
to
his
brother
warren
the
methodist
bishop
money
be
not
meant
to
be
hoard
myself
and
all
i
have
i
try
to
keep
righteously
active
certainly
candler
saw
to
it
that
his
family
enjoy
a
decent
life
and
his
child
grow
up
in
a
comfortable
mansion
in
elegant
inman

atlanta

his

lucy

sweet
fish
as
he
nickname
her
played
the
piano
and
he
love
to
listen
and
sing
along
it
be
just
that
he
try
to
teach
his
child
the
value
of
thrift
when
two
of
the
boy
want
tool
kit
one
christmas
he
bought
a
single
set
and
make
them
share
he
raise
chicken
in
the

money
in
candler
s
view
ought
to
be
properly
earn
and
usefully
spent
and
it
be
plain
that
the
profit
pour
in
from
coca
cola
bother
him
on
both
count
he
be
proud
of
his
hard
work
over
the
year
but
the
accumulation
of
wealth
especially
once
it
become
virtually
automatic
seem
to
scratch
a
raw
spot
on
his
conscience
he
want
to
leave
a
legacy
of
tangible
accomplishment
candler
take
far
more
pleasure
from
his
burgeon

in

than
he
do
in

of
the
assault
on
his
product

reputation
and
his
family
s
good
name
he

not
be
terribly
proud
of
sell
sugar
and
water
to
people
for
a
nickel
a
glass
but
he
bristle
at
the
idea
that
he
be
a

the

that

an
idea
candler
once
subtly
encourage
now
enrage
him
he
come
to
detest
the
suggestive
nickname
people
use
in

of

one
of

s
employee
told
the

invite
the

him
at
the
soda
fountain
and
have
a

to

now
that
he

approach
his
sixty
candler
have
begin
to
grow
more
and
more
conscious
of
his
own
mortality
his
father
have
die
young
and
candler
fear
the
same
fate
he
want
to
devote
his
final
year
to
charitable
work
and
public
service
and
that
meant
get
out
of
the
coca
cola
company
the
question
be
how
in
his
young
day
candler
have
insist
that
his
son
stay
away
from
the
business
peddle
soft
drink
he
say
be
a
pursuit
with
a
narrow
compass
candler
be
especially
anxious
for
his
eldest
boy
howard
to
attend
medical
school
and
become
a
doctor
the
career
asa
himself
have
be
force
to
abandon
gradually
though
asa
s
resolve
weaken
and
his
attitude
change
he
grow
ambivalent
howard
seem
determine
to
work
for
the
company
during
vacation
and
break
and
asa
felt
flatter
in
spite
of
himself
at
his
son
s
interest
in
the
business
one
summer
asa
offer
howard
a
job
at
the
company
and
in
almost
the
same
breath
urge
him
not
to
take
it
the
employment
that
i
offer
you
will
be
around
our
factory
pack
painting
fill
and
such
work
as
require
common
labor
and
would
not
be
any
benefit
to
your
mind
howard
take
the
position
anyway
and
enjoy
the
work
from
that
point
on
perhaps
without
fully
realize
it
asa
begin
draw
howard
toward
a
career
with
the
company
when
howard
visit
europe
in
the
summer
of
after
graduate
from
college
his
father
give
him
careful
instruction
to
make
note
on

condition
and
ass
coca

chance
we
must
have
ice
hot
weather
long
summer
etc
you
will
know
what
to
look
for
that
fall
when
howard
return
to
the
united
state
asa
ask
him
to
begin
his
medical
study
in
new
york
city
where
he
could
also
keep
tab
on
coca
cola
s
sale
office
a
year
later
cite
eye
strain
and
overall
fatigue
howard
drop
his
plan
to
become
a
doctor
and
his
father
give
him
a
full
time
job
for
the
first
time
asa
start
think
about
the
possibility
that
howard
might
succeed
him
in
run
the
company
howard
candler
s
first
permanent
assignment
for
coca
cola
be
to
remain
in
new
york
and
try
to
bring
order
to
the
chaos
in
the
office
there
it
do
not
go
well
asa
consider
new
york
a
bottomless
pit
that
chewed
up
men
and
money
and
he
regret
have
go
there
in
the
first
place
sidewalk
vendor
sell
flavor
soda
water
for
a
penny
a
glass
badly
undercut
coca
cola
s
pricing
and
the
saloon
be
reluctant
to
carry
the
southern
beverage
it
be
unlikely
howard
could
have
do
much
to
improve
the
company
s
fortune
even
if
he
d
displayed
an
aptitude
for
business
but
as
it
be
the
experience
unnerved
him
howard
be
only
twenty
three
year
old
with
a
nervous
disposition
and
he
found
that
he
disliked
commerce
i
really
enjoy
the
office
part
of
the
work
he
write
his
father
but
i
don
t
like
to
distribute
ticket
and
sell
good
more
i
don
t
like
to
have
to
be
sociable
with
the
trade
such
as
be
demand
to
a
certain
extent
here
i
mean
that
the
salesman
for
an
article
have
to
go
in
frequently
and
talk
to
a
proprietor
and
his
help
of
soda
men
and
clerk
i
don
t
like
that
the
confession
be
remarkable
in
a
business
that
rely
almost
entirely
on
salesmanship
the
bos
s
son
found
it
distasteful
to
talk
to
the
people
who
bought
the
product
asa
brought
his
son
back
to
atlanta
and
tucked
him
away
from
the
public
aspect
of
the
business
put
him
in
charge
of
the
syrup
factory
it
be
the
happiest
period
of
howard
s
career
year
later
use
language
suit
to
a
religious
experience
howard
described
his
initiation
into
what
he
call
the
holy
of
holy
when
his
father
entrust
him
with
the
secret
formula
there
be
no
write
version
instead
asa
make
his
son
memorize
the
content
of
the
various

oversee
all
of
the

s
operation
and
push
him
to
take
a
strong
hand
especially
in
personnel
matter
as
the
month
pass
asa
kept
encourage
howard
to
think
harder
about
the
business
so
that
you
may
thoroughly
master
its
detail
carry
it
on
successfully
reading
between
the
line
it
seem
as
if
asa
sense
his

s
limitation
all
the
while
refuse
to
admit
to
himself
just
how
severe
they
be
there
be
another
problem
run
the
company
be
one
thing
but
asa
candler
also
own
coca
cola
he
be
free
to
retire
and
place
his

in

whenever
he
pleased
no
matter
what
misgiving
he
might
harbor
but
that
would
not
resolve

asa
have
four
other
child
if
he
left
the

to
howard
it
would
mean
disinherit
asa
jr
lucy
walter
and
william
that
option
be
unacceptable
but
divide
the
company
into
five
piece
be
a
troublesome
idea
too
what
if
the
child
kept
their
share
and
the
company
fail
they
would
be
left
penniless
what
if
the
child
sell
their
share
would
stranger
come
along
and
gain
control
would
they
force
howard
out
of
a
job
candler
s
dilemma
be
not
just
hypothetical
in
he
quietly
sound
out
one
of
his
acquaintance
about
buying
the
company
samuel
brown
be
a
well
to
do
cotton
broker
and
banker
from
albany
georgia
he
like
to
visit
the
capital
city
club
when
he
be
in
atlanta
to
play
a
few
hand
of
euchre
and
he
also
like
to
keep
an
eye
on
the
coca
cola
company
his
son
in
law
harold
hirsch
be
a
bright
young
partner
in
john
candler
s
law
firm
yes
brown
told
asa
candler
he
would
be
very
interested
in
the
possibility
of
acquire
the
company
brown
come
from
a
german
jewish
family
the
name
be
anglicize
from
braun
and
maintain
connection
with
a
bank
in
hamburg
he
thought
he
might
be
able
to
arrange
the
financing
in
europe
what
brown
have
in
mind
be
a
fairly
simple
two
step
plan
he
want
to
buy
the
coca
cola
company
from
candler
and
then
turn
right
around
and
sell
share
in
it
to
small
investor
all
across
the
south
after
all
coca
cola
s
sale
be
still
overwhelmingly
concentrate
in
the
region
and
the
drink
be
still
perceive
as
a
southern
product
brown
thought
people
in
the
south
would
have
as
much
enthusiasm
about
own
part
of
the
company
as
they
do
about
drinking
the
product
the
idea
suit
asa
candler
perfectly
he
could
be
do
with
the
company
once
and
for
all
he
could
take
his
accumulate
profit
off
the
company
s
book
and
use
the
money
for
the
charitable
purpose
he
now
ache
to
fulfill
and
in
theory
at
least
take
the
company
public
promise
to
provide
a
solution
to
the
predicament
of
succession
within
his
family
the
other
child
would
receive
enough
cash
to
make
them
secure
for
life
while
howard
would
get
to
remain
with
the
company
and
run
it
the
new
owner
would
not
be
an
individual
or
group
of
individual
anxious
to
put
in
their
own
management
but
instead
the
public
would
own
coca
cola
and
the
people
of
the
south
would
be
happy
to
have
a
candler
stay
in
charge
indeed
they
would
insist
on
have
a
candler
at
the
top
howard
would
be
protect
but
there
be
a
snag
before
brown
and
candler
could
negotiate
an
agreement
they
be
interrupt
when
howard

to
come
the
key
to
the

the

you

answer

spell
out
his
think
in
theory
coca

kola
could
be
adulterate

contrary
the

when
dobbs
get
home
candler

him
and
told
him
to
stop

be
a
primitive
unwholesome
craft
in
candler
s
view
there
be
too
many
folk
who
be
not
responsible
he
explain
who
care
nothing
about
the
reputation
of
what
they
put
up
and
i
be
afraid
the
name
of
coca
cola
will
be
injured
bottle
with
hutchinson
stopper
be
notoriously
hard
to
clean
and
sanitize
and
few
of
the
early
bottler
even
bother
to
try
it
be
not
unusual
for
a
bottle
machine
to
be
place
in
the
stable
conveniently
near
the
wagon
on
a
floor

with
straw
and

candler
told
dobbs
to
confine
himself
to
sell
the

solely
for
use
at
soda

as
he
recount
the
episode
year
later
dobbs
remember
stand
up
to
his
uncle
and
argue
for
what
he
believe
there
simply
weren
t
enough
soda
fountain
the
smart
move
would
be
to
sell
coca
cola
wherever
they
could
any
way
they
could
a
glass
of
coke
could
be
sell
only
at

a

of

could
be
ship
anywhere
sell
anywhere
consume
anywhere
it
be
the
future
of
the
business
and
it
be
limitless
perhaps
young
dobbs
still
in
his
teen
be
not
quite
as
bold
with
his
uncle
as
he
enjoy
recall
not
many
men
have
the
gumption
to
talk
back
to
asa
candler
yet
there
be
no
question
dobbs
be
an
advocate
of
bottle
coca
cola
long
before
others
join
him
in
push
the
same
idea
in
the
popular
movie
imitation
of
life
star
claudette
colbert
a
character
repeat
the
widespread
myth
that
asa
candler
once
paid
for
a
two
word
piece
of
advice
about
coca
cola
bottle
it
but
the
truth
of
the
matter
be
that
candler
get
the
advice
free
from
his
own
nephew
and
simply
chose
to
ignore
it
for
more
than
a
decade
during
the
first
two
full
season
of
the
candler
era
the
summer
of

dobbs
travel

as
far
west
as
the
mississippi
river
and
as
far
north
as
north

he
brag
later
with
justification
that
he
do
more
than
any
other
individual
to
introduce
coca

in
the
region
then
graduate
quickly
from

be
assign
a
desk
in
atlanta
and
take
charge
of
the
company
s
shipping
department
it
be
a
job
that
require
a
certain
degree
of
precision
since
his
uncle
asa
would
dock
his
pay
if
he
make
a
mistake
and
sent
a
shipment
to
oxford
north
carolina
say
instead
of
oxford
mississippi
but
dobbs
handle
his
chore
well
as
he
grow
into
manhood
in
the

complete
his
apprenticeship

side

gain
polish
and
a

of

confidence
the

the

give
away
the

it
be
perhaps
an
indication

intellectual
limitation
that
he
do
not

to
begin
the

the

the
incident

no
quarrel
with
the
switch
away
from
the
tone
and
technique
of
old
fashion
advertising
his
criticism
of
robinson

massengale
be
that
they
didn
t
go
far
enough
in
dobbs
s
view
coca
cola
advertising
ought
to
attract
the
eye
with
something
appeal
in
the
way
of
an
illustration
that
in
itself
tell
a

then

that
story
on
the

a
reason
why
they

a

dobbs
concede

isn
t
it
something
more
than
a

marketing
difference
however
be
not
the
real
issue
the
clash
between
robinson
and
dobbs
over

come
at
the
same
time
asa
candler
be
begin
to
withdraw
more
and
more
from
the
daily
operation
of
the

take
a

off

create
a
power
vacuum
in

it
become
apparent
that
robinson

dobbs
be
actually
compete
to
see
who
would
run
the
coca
cola
company
in
the
year
ahead
gain
authority
over

be
the
key
to

control

the
whole

it

possible
to
be

by
dobbs

the
grace
to
conceal
his
longing

dobbs
make
the
mistake
of
let
everyone
in
the
company
and
the
candler
family
know
just
how
badly
he
want
to

most

repel
among
his

still
know
disparagingly
as
sammie
in
reference
to
his
humble
beginning
in
the
country
they
found
something
unseemly
about
his
willingness
to
climb
over
a
man
as
gentle
and
loyal
as
frank
robinson
and
of
course
they
found
something
fearful
in
his
eagerness
to
climb
over
them
his
cousin
saw
dobbs
s
assault
on
st
elmo

as
nothing
more
than
a
matter
of
office
politics

jealousy
dobbs

after
massengale
s
hide
because
massengale
work
for

in

way
thus
it
come

throughout
the

when

the
struggle
in

point

that

a
brilliant

in
the
private
conversation

of
a

and
his

not
in
the
open

council
as
dobbs
saw
it
he
be
the

top
executive
and
he
believe
he
could
count
on
others
to

that
way
too
for
all
dobbs

tactfully
put
it
a
quiet
kind
and
friendly
man
one
who
might
be
dedicate
to
coca

but
plainly
lack
the
talent
to
run
the

apprehension
though
asa
be
gradually
persuade

there
be
nothing
in

in
detail
why

in

of

no
doubt
the
thickness
of

the
decisive
factor

that
howard
would
have
suffer
in

candler
kept
the

in
a

when
he
announce
tersely
at
the
annual

that
his

howard
be
succeed
him
as
president
in
a
book
he
write
about
his
father
year
later
howard
speculate
that
the
change
of
the
guard
be
attributable
to
a
combination
of
factor
start
with
asa
s
bitter
vexation
over
the
new
federal
tax
law
he
felt
howard
write
of
asa
that
he
could
no

conduct
his

in
the
way
he
believe
it
should
be
conduct
to
assure
its
best
progress
and
to
realize
its
potential
greatness
howard
described
his
father
as
extremely
discourage
over
coca
cola
s
prospect
and
he
thought
perhaps
his
father
be
also
depressed
because
he
miss
frank
robinson
who
retire
in
in
poor
health
the
portrait
howard
paint
of
his
father
s
state
of
mind
be
noteworthy
for
the
attitude
of
surrender
and
hopelessness
it
depicts
if
asa
candler
have
any
faith
that
his

be
equip
to
lead
coca

any
optimism
that
the

certainly
he
fail
utterly
to
convey
it
to
howard
asa
seem
to
have
hand
his

the
rein
of
an
enterprise
he
believe
to
be
on
the
brink
of
decline
possibly
disaster
it
appear
in
fact
that
candler

abrupt
disengagement
from
the

alarmed
some
of

in
a
clear
sign
of

call
its

even
though
it
contain
little

go
into
a
complete
collapse
the

s
real

would
still
be
worth
roughly

there

others
who
have
reach
pam

conclusion
that
the
chattanooga

settle
and
they
make
it
clear
to
the

to
handle
the
job
for
a

less

in
anticipation
of

the

s
food
administrator
herbert
hoover
decreed
that

manufacturer
would
be
limited
to
a
half

for
the

its

only
ten

and
it
become
clear
by

middle
of

that

have
to

the

take
the

to

on
the
day
the

d
arcy
recall
later
that
mr

have
a
clip
of
the
advertisement
on
his
desk
when
we
knock
at
his
door
he
open
up
completely
conversationally
and
by
his
attitude
it
be
frankly
a
refresh
experience
and
when
we
left
his
office
we
felt
that
we
have
do
well
by
all
the
episode
be
a
foreshadow
of
the
strategy
that

be
sure
to
associate
the

with
the
high
national

it
be
a
privilege
d
arcy
write
for
the
company
to
sacrifice
its
sugar
to
the
american
fight
man
in
the
spring
of

relaxed
the

and

to
make

as

as
it

in
and
profit
be
as
narrow
as
asa
candler
predict
but
the
important
point
be
that
coca

survive
in
after
the
last
restriction
be
lift
the
company
be
able
to

that
have

during

and

almost
double

about
two

restore
on

at

it
appear
that

weather
its
storm
and

twenty
keg
of

and
a
half

earlier
the
only
objection

by

bitterly
for

that

unfolded
next
at

regular
coca

the
suggestion
that
the

consider
have
its

might
be
a
good
idea
he
explain

the
company

the
proper
amount
to

sensible
and
the
candlers
readily
agree

no
one
have
any
way

know
the
real
purpose
behind
the

the
truth
of
the
matter
be
that
it

nothing
to
do
with

be
negotiate
his
own
private
deal
to
sell

the
audit
to
verify
the
financial
status
of
the
business
it
be
vital
to
dobbs
that
his

not
just
his

next

tarnished
his

even
far
in
two
year
after
the

fight
hurt
fell
ill
and
his
doctor
mistakenly
diagnose

confine

to

even
though

recover
fully
within
a
few
week
move
quickly
to
make
his
mark
while
practice

the

on
the

use
a

to
put
his

e
woodruff
just
below
it
hurt
never
forgave
woodruff
for
what
he
believe
be
a

coup
and
relation
between
the
brother
in

be
strain
from
then
on
around
town
businessmen
marvel
at
woodruff
s
brilliance
and
toughness
but
they
also
whisper
that
he
be
not
as
one
of
them
put
it
altogether
on
the
up
and
up
asa
candler
share
the
community
s
widespread
feel
of
distaste
toward
woodruff
and
woodruff
knew
it
at
one
point
in
woodruff
told
an
associate
he
be
interested
in
acquire
candler
s
bank
and
merge
it
into
trust
company
and
the
associate
warn
him
that
candler
would
never
do
business
with
him
so
it
be
understandable
that
later
when
woodruff
s
eye
turn
to
the
coca
cola
company
he
decide
to
keep
his
involvement
a
secret
i
knew
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
approach
him
or
any
of
his
family
woodruff
explain
afterward
and
i
undertook
to
do
it
through
other
people
in
sam
dobbs
be
a
respect
member
of
atlanta
s
business
elite
he
be
elect
president
of
the
chamber
of
commerce
and
give
a
well
receive
wide
range
talk
at
the
woman
s
club
in
which
he
advocate
improvement
of
the
public
school
decency
in
woman
s
fashion
and
strict
reliance
on
reference
in
hire

help
he
also
count
himself
a
close
friend
of
ernest
woodruff
have
invest
heavily
in
several
of
trust
company
s
venture
dobbs
serve
as
a
director
of
the
steel
company
and
atlantic
ice
and
coal
and
in
he
go
on
the
board
of
the
bank
itself
when
woodruff
ask
him
about
the
possibility
of
buying
the
coca
cola
company
dobbs
recall
later
i
told
him
i
thought
probably
it
could
be
do
that
i
would
be
willing
to
sell
out
that
i
would
like
very
much
to
sell
out
dobbs
agree
with
woodruff
that
it
would
be
best
to
keep
woodruff
s
name
out
of
the
deal
to
guard
against
inadvertent
disclosure
they
decide
to
hold
their
meeting
in
private
at
the
waldorf
hotel
in
new
york
city
where
they
quickly
reach
agreement
on
the
major
detail
of
the
transaction
the
information
dobbs
provide
about
the
company
s
financial
status
back
up
by
the
finding
of
the
audit
convince
woodruff
that
the
ask
price
of
million
be
justified
provide
the
buy
out
could
be
structure
to
his
satisfaction
it
be
not
a
trade
trust
company
could
swing
on
its
own
the
bank
s
net
worth
at
the
time
be
a
modest
million
and
it
be
clear
that
woodruff
would
have
to
find
backer
on
wall
street
rely
on
partner
represent
an
unhappy
complication
for
the
freewheel
woodruff
but
he
found
a
silver
line
the
partner
could
be
cloaked
with
the
appearance
of
be
the
actual
buyer
thereby
conceal
woodruff
s
role
the
first
order
of
business
be
to
lock
down
the
right
to
make
the
purchase
and
to
do
that
woodruff
have
to
get
candler
s
offspring
to
sign
option
on
the
ownership
certificate
they
held
in
the
old
corporation
they
would
not
sign
in
defiance
of
their
father
and
their
father
would
not
sell
to
woodruff
so
it
be
vital
to
suggest
to
the
candlers
that
someone
else
be
acquire
the
company
woodruff
have
just
the
man
in
mind
eugene
stetson
be
a
native
of
hawkinsville
georgia
who
have
pursue
a
banking
career
in
the
north
rise
to
become
vice
president
of
the
powerful
guaranty
trust
company
stetson
help
woodruff
round
up
a
syndicate
of
new
york
investor
willing
to
underwrite
the
major
portion
of
the
purchase
and
he
also
agree
to
handle
the
negotiation
with
the
candlers
there
be
no
proof
that
stetson
openly
misrepresent
himself
but
he
do
leave
the
candlers
with
the
plain
impression
that
he
be
the
head
of
the
group
of
investor
who
want
to
buy
the
company
and
that
his
bank
guaranty
trust
be
the
lead
institution
dobbs
do
nothing
to
hide
his
own
role
in
the
transaction
on
the
contrary
he
enlist
harold
hirsch
as
an
ally
hirsch
be
also
a
director
of
trust
company
and
together
they
work
to
persuade
the
member
of
the
candler
family
that
the
deal
be
good
for
them
and
also
in
the
best
interest
of
the
future
of
the
company
in
late
july
an
atlanta
lawyer
name
robert
c
alston
make
the
round
and
obtain
the
signature
of
asa

s
five
child
on
a
single
sheet
of
paper
a
blank
option
for
the
purchase
of
their
stock
there
be
no
easy
explanation
for
the
inattention
the
candlers
paid
to
the
detail
of
the
transaction
unless
it
be
their
comfort
with
the
understand
that
stetson
and
his
bank
be
go
to
receive
the
option
howard
candler
testify
later
that
he
be
unsure
what
interest
alston
represent
and
it
may
be
that
all
of
the
candlers
be
weary
to
the
point
of
indifference
after
the
difficult
fruitless
negotiation
that
have
be
grind
on
for
the
past
several
year
what
be
indisputable
however
be
that
alston
be
not
represent
stetson
but
instead
be
act
on
behalf
of
his
friend
and
fellow

of
the

later

be
profoundly

chagrin
that

it

essential
that

that
it

eight
time
more
money
for

figure
of

as
their
stake
in

woodruff
and
his
new

partner
next
begin
thrash
out
the
division
of
the
spoil
woodruff
found
himself
handcuffed
by
the
restriction
impose
by
his
board
of
director
back
in
atlanta
and
at
one
point
he
rattle
off
a
telegram
to
trust
company
s
executive
committee
complain
impossible
to
undertake
to
continue
an

at

long
range
he
demand
and
receive
nearly
complete
autonomy
in
negotiate
the
fine
point
of
the

but
the
board
be
adamant
in
hold
trust
company

overall
participation
in
the
sale
to
million
or
a
little
more
than
twice
its
net
worth
and
the
board
stuck
to
its
stipulation
that
half
the
bank
s
participation
have
to
be
underwritten
by
liquid
asset
as
a
result
woodruff
somehow
have
to
scrape
together
more
than
million
in
cash
and
he
have
a
deadline
that
be
quickly
approach
what
happen
next
provide
the
basis
for
some
of
the
great
family
fortune
in
atlanta
but
at
the
time
the
mood
be
one
of
haste
and
uncertainty
woodruff
and
the
board
decide
to
raise
the
million
through
a
subscription
among
trust
company
s
stockholder
on
august
just
nine
day
before
the

to

a
letter
marked
strictly
confidential
be
mail
to
each

ask
him
to
put
up
for

he
held
of
the

s

the

plan
to
pool
the
money
and
hold
it
as
a
reserve
during
the
coca
cola
offering
afterward
assume
all
go
well
the
stockholder
would
be
repaid
and
participate
in
an
otherwise
unspecified
distribution
of
trust
company
s
proceeds
from
the
transaction
it
be
difficult
to
imagine
what
the
bank
s
shareholder
must
have
thought
when
the
letter
be
deliver
for
one
thing
it
be
the
first
many
of
them
have
heard
of
the
impend
sale
of
the
coca
cola
company
the
town
s
most
important
commercial
enterprise
and
the
news
undoubtedly
come
as
a
shock
then
too
the
letter
have
a
breathless
tone
to
it
which
be
hardly
surprising
since
woodruff
have
draft
it
off
the
top
of
his
head
this
be
a
large
transaction
involve
a
large
sum
of
money
and
we
have
make
a
large
commitment
in
connection
with
the
financing
of
the
enterprise
the
letter
say
leave
no
doubt
that
it
be
a
large
deal
indeed
most
of
all
perhaps
the
recipient
would
have
be
excite
and
confuse
they
be
told
virtually
nothing
about
the
term
of
the
transaction
only
that
it
will
be
necessary
to
make
the
financial
arrangement
immediately
and
before
the
detail
can
be
work
out
they
have
five
day
to

meanwhile
an
unexpected

that

his

woodruff
be
in
a
rage
if
the

unlikely

the
candlers
be
now
fully
aware
he
be
a
principal
in
the
deal
and
that
knowledge
alone
probably
be
enough
to
scuttle
any
chance
of
future
negotiation
if
woodruff
do
not
exercise
his
option
by
august

there

to

some
of
the
fine

in

there
be
a

which
be
responsible
for
the
remarkable
growth
and
successful
operation
of
the

will
continue
and
will
also
be
interested
through
the
ownership
of
a
substantial
amount
of
the

of
the
company
to
the
unpracticed
eye
the
statement
sound
very
much
like
a
commitment
that
the
candlers
would
still

that
be
not
exactly
the

over
the
company
s
affair
in
fact
it
would
have
very
little
authority
at
all
because
the

have
quietly

all
the
right
of

that
but
they
do
and
from
a

standpoint
drove

actually

could
not

it

so
much

possible
actually
it
be
inevitable
but
the
first
order
of

take
care
of
howard
candler
the
director
quickly
elect
him
chairman
which
have
be
the
plan
all
along
and
then
take
the
unusual
step
of
formally
amend
their
brand
new
by
law
to
stipulate
that
candler
s
authority
would
be
co
extensive
with
that
of
the
new
president
dobbs
that
his
salary
would
be
the
same
as
dobbs
s
and
that
he
would
remain
in
direct
charge
of
the
company
s
manufacturing
operation
candler
test
his
strength
immediately
interrupt
the
meeting
to
question
some
of
the
interim
decision
woodruff
and
dobbs
have
make
during
the
four
week
since
the
option
be
exercise
trust
company
have
bought
a
chemical
laboratory
for
instance
and
candler
argue
that
most
of
its
asset
be
unneeded
he
make
a
motion
to
sell
off
the
great
part
of
the
lab
s
equipment
and
the
board
agree
then
he
make
a
motion
to
move
the
material
that
remain
and
the
board
agree
again
the
board
agree
with
everything
candler
have
to
say
that
morning
and
they
do
so
with
the
utmost
courtesy
whatever
he
want
be
fine
at
least
for
a
few
more

first
step
in
the
public
offering
of
coca

have
go
flawlessly

step
be
under
way
and
the
broker
be

the

over
the

it
have
become
an
article
of

at

otherwise
might

the
truth
be
candler
really
do
throw
away
something
of
tremendous
value
he
and
his

could
easily
have
act
as

themselves
recruiting
the

they

entirely
candler
have
more

refuse
to
let
them
leave
them
to
watch
sullenly
as
others
grow

the
problem
be
not
just
that
the

make
more

it
be
a
mark
of

for
a
time
it

into
the
rank
of
hunter
and
rainwater
they
be
certainly
panic

it
be
true
that

they
however
seem
to

that

actually

a
harsh

of

dobbs
ought
to

since
he
help
engineer
the
deal
in
the
first
place
far
weaken
his

dobbs
count
on
support
from

he
should
have
know
would
remain

work

at

serve
him
as

of
the
atlantic

by
some
woeful
miscalculation
dobbs
convince
himself
that
he
could
muster
a
majority
of
coca
cola
s
director
when
in
fact
he
stood
almost
alone
on
october
dobbs
return
to
atlanta
from
a
lengthy
business
trip
visit
the

in
the
western

as
he
step
off
the

a

him
to
go
directly
to
the

when
dobbs
emerge
from

he
go
to
his
desk
and
write
out
his
resignation
as
president
of
the
coca

company
his
tenure
have
last
just
one
year
and
two
week
in
describe
the

to
his

in
explain
why
he
quit
other
than
to

to
you
that
under
present
condition
as
i
found
them
upon
my
return
here
i
could
not
remain
with
the
company
and
retain
my
self
respect
the
best
guess
be
that
woodruff
have
gather
enough
support
from
the
board
to
whittle
down
dobbs
s
authority
during
an
executive
committee
meeting
in

woodruff

counting
up
the

s
advertising
and
publicity
expense
portray
dobbs
as
a
big
spender
and
it
appear
they
plan
to
take
away
his
control
of
the
budget
certainly
they
succeed
in
checkmate
his
plan
for
an
aggressive
advertising
campaign
in
any
case
dobbs
make
no
secret
of
his
feeling
he
could
retire
comfortably
he
told
d
arcy
and
i
be
in
a
position
where
it
will
not
be
necessary
for
me
to
act
either
as
mr
bradley
s
valet
or
woodruff
s
office
boy
in
a
stroke
of
wicked
irony
the
board
ask
howard
candler
to
return
as
president
of
the
coca

company
thus
make

nightmare
into
a
reality
for
the
second

drive
him

it
bother
woodruff
that

cost
more
at

and
on
the
train
than
it
do
at

and
he
badger
candler
to
do
something
about
it
though
candler
couldn
t
imagine
what
on
a
related
front
woodruff
be
press
candler
to
subsidize
select
retailer
in
every
market
and
compel
them
to
sell
coke
for
a
nickel
thereby
put
pressure
on
other
retailer
to
cut
their

as
well
candler
thought
the
policy
be
distasteful
and
refuse
to
implement
it
for
his
part
woodruff
found
candler
impossibly
naive
as
winter
turn

in
investor
in

be
put

a

financial

psychological
struggle
for
control
of
the

woodruff
be
the
key
player
and
he
want
a
president
who
would
help
him
not
one
who
call
thing
distasteful
and
balk
at
every
move
the
price
of
coca
cola
common
begin
creep
back
up
and
the
reason
be
simple
speculator
be
gamble
on
the
possibility
that
coca
cola
might
survive
after
all
huge

and
most
of
the

come
from

it

a
battle
might
be
shape
up
between

woodruff
s
use
of
the
voting
trust
to
maintain
control
of
the
company
s
affair
be
in
jeopardy
partly
because
the
legality
of
such
trust
be
under
attack
and
partly
because
many
of
the
stock
transfer
be
go
unrecorded
with
ownership
passing
into
unknown
hand
woodruff
try
to
explain
to
candler
that
if
new
owner
come
along
and
gain
control
the
old
management
probably
would
be
show
the
door
but
candler
could
not
or
would
not
recognize
the
threat
he
told
woodruff
he
couldn
t
see
why
anyone
would
want
to
get
rid
of
him
at
one
board
meeting
candler
want
to
talk
about
expand
the
company
s
fledgling
overseas
business
he
begin
urge
the
director
to
think
about
establish
branch
in
other
country
until
woodruff
rudely
cut
him
off
and
signal
for
an
adjournment
daydream
about
coca
cola
s
future
be
fine
woodruff
say
but
it
be
a
fool
s
luxury
what
matter
be
the
present
there
wasn
t
much
point
planning
foreign
operation
if
the
company
be
about
to
fail
or
if
someone
intend
to
sneak
up
and
snatch
it
out
from
under
them
if
candler
have
his
heart
set
on
pursue
the
subject
if
he
have
to
waste
the
board
member
time
woodruff
suggest
then
he
ought
to
write
them
a
letter
which
be
just
what
candler
be
reduce
to
do
in
the
meantime
woodruff
turn
all
of
his
considerable
wile
to
the
challenge
of
trading
against
the
new

investor
during
the
spring
of

make
a

of

secret
most
of
them
difficult
to
interpret
all
of
them
design
to
improve
his
position
there
be
no
question
he
engage
in
insider
trading
practice
that
would
be
illegal
today
as
do
the
other
side
at
one
point
woodruff
try
to
bully
candler
into
release
a
patently
false
report
exaggerate
the
company
s
progress
in
digest
its
supply
of
high

sugar
at
other
time
he
leak
contradictory
rumor
send
the
stock
price
down
apparently
so
that
he
could
buy

at
a
reduce
price
on
one
occasion
when
woodruff
make
a
visit
to
new

candler
take
note
of
a
very
rapid
and
unusual
advance
in
the
price
of
the
company
s
stock
even
though
nothing
have
occur
in
the
status
of
the
business
to
justify
such
advance
candler
be
certain
woodruff

provide
confidential
information
some
of
it
falsify
to
the
financial
press
in

he
even
summon
the
gumption
to
challenge
woodruff
about
his
activity
during
a
face
to
face
meeting
but
woodruff
answer
coolly
that
he
have
no
idea
what
candler
be
talk
about
and
end
the
conversation
for
a
time
at
least
it
appear
woodruff
be
willing
to
sell
out
in
a
strange
episode
in
april
he
told
candler
that
an
unnamed
investor
in
new

be
offering
to
buy
a
block
of
share
of
stock
accord
to
note
candler
make
at
the
time
woodruff
say
he
want
to
make
the
sale
and
have
put
together
a
pool
of
share
toward
that
end
he
want
candler
s
help
in
assemble
the
other

if
true
it
be
a
significant
moment
in
coca

history
the

meant
to

out

up

new

take
over
yet
there
be
no
certain
way

know
the
truth

the
matter
because
woodruff
routinely
hid
his
real
motif
behind
a
cloak
of
misdirection
in
any
case
candler
refuse
to
participate
unless
the
buy

to
the

believe
his

learn
to
treat
woodruff
with
suspicion
once
at
woodruff

direction
candler

out
a
formal
statement
deny
that

exhaust
and
insist
that

be

respond
to

the
great

that
both

though
they
would
never

the

the
one
question
that
remain
unresolved
be

if
he

to
the
task
of
take
it
out
of
their

he
say
nothing
publicly
but
bank

that
he
spent
the

with
the

woodruff
also
begin
look
for
a
new
way
of
exercise

if

to
maintain
his
ultimate
authority
over

of

s
affair
and
he
most
assuredly
do
then
he
would
have
to
devise
a
mean
of
circumvent
a
board
of
director
that
be
grow
increasingly
responsive
to
the
interest

if
he
left

nothing

of
the

the

the

georgian
still
own
more
than
half

as
far
as
they
be
concerned
woodruff
s
proposal
seem
perfectly
reasonable
it
be
strictly
a
paper

soon
as

assertion
they
later
divorce
and
diva
brown
as
she
be
know
after
she
remarry
become
a
minor
celebrity
in
the
south
around
the
turn
of
the
century
peddle
copy
of
the
authentic
formula
although
a
trade
journal
label
her
a
humbug
and
a
fake
she
have
many
taker
five
get
your
readiness
when
he
be
a
very
old
man
when
he
have
be
run
the
affair
of
the
coca
cola
company
for
more
than
sixty
year
and
have
turn
its
trademark
into
the
most
familiar
symbol
in
the
world
when
he
be
herald
as
one
of
the
most
successful
businessmen
of

after
he

make
and
give
away
hundred
of
million
of

even
then
robert
woodruff
maintain
the
myth
he
could
not
bear
to
have
anyone
think
his
father
give
him
the
job
and
so
he
create
an
elaborate
fable
to
explain
how
he
rise
to
the
presidency
of
coca
cola
ernest
woodruff
be
such
a
terror
and
so
monumentally
inept
at
operating
the
company
that
the
other
member
of
the
board
go
behind
his
back
and
arrange
to
hire
his
son
his
strong
will
defiant
son
to
be
the
new
president
that
be
the
story
when
no
one
else
would
stand
up
to
ernest
woodruff
the
board
brought
in
the
one
man
who
could
tame
the
lion
and
bring
order
to
chaos
the
way
bob
woodruff
told
it
the
way
he
genuinely
seem
to
remember
it
after
all
the
retell
over
the
year
be
that
three
of
his
father
s
closest
friend
include
w
c
bradley
come
to
visit
him
in
new
york
city
during
the
winter
of
the
coca
cola
company
be
about
to
go
broke
they
told
him
he
have
to
come
back
to
atlanta
and
take
charge
of
the
management
and
save
their
investment
he
held
a
stake
in
the
company
too
they
remind
him
he
have
borrow
heavily
and
go
into
debt
to
buy
coca
cola
stock
and
now
the
value
of
that
stock
be
in
dire
jeopardy
respond
to
the
urgent
persuasion
of
his
visitor
the
young
woodruff
reluctantly
agree
to
return
home
accord
to
a
statement
he
later
place
in
the
company
s
archive
the
board
elect
him
president
at
a
special
meeting
in
april
even
though
his
father
object
strongly
and
then
stalk
out
of
the
room
and
abstain
from
voting
the
only
reason
i
take
that
job
woodruff
like
to
tell
people
be
to
get
back
the
money
i
have
invest
in
coca
cola
stock
i
figure
that
if
i
ever
brought
the
price
of
stock
back
to
what
i
have
paid
for
it
i
d
sell
and
get
even
it
make
a
fetch
tale
tidy
and
plausible
and
eventually
every
account
of
the
company
s
history
repeat
it
in
one
version
or
another
only
it
wasn
t
true
in
the
coca
cola
company
be
like
a
patient
recover
with
surprising
swiftness
after
a
terrible
accident
in
spite
of
the
bruise
feeling
and
distrust
between
the
company
and
its
bottler
there
be
a
grudge
realization
on
everyone
s
part
that
the
smart
course
would
be
to
return
to
business
as
usual
because
business
as
usual
meant
profit
when
hundred
of
bottler
and
fountain
salesman
assemble
in
atlanta
on
the
even
of
tuesday
march
for
a
convention
aim
at
hasten
the
heal
process
one
of
the
first
thing
they
saw
be
a
huge
life
size
mock
up
of
a
village
in
the
warehouse
section
of
the
coca
cola
factory
it
look
like
something
from
a
movie
set
the
display
of
shop
front
along
main
street
show
a
right
side
and
a
wrong
side
and
while
it
be
design
to
illustrate
the
right
and
wrong
way
of
merchandising
coca
cola
window
sign
should
be
big
but
uncluttered
paint
with
a
pattern
or
blueprint
and
never
drawn
freehand
it
also
serve
as
a
perfect
metaphor
the
company
intend
to
do
thing
the
right
way
from
now
on
over
the
course
of
two
full
day
of
meeting
the
bottler
heard
pep
talk
from
every
official
in
the
coca
cola
hierarchy
in
every
case
the
message
be
the
same
the
business
be
back
on
track
the
national
economy
be
emerge
at
last
from
its
linger
postwar
doldrums
and
the
company
intend
to
follow
suit
ernest
woodruff
make
his
first
and
last
public
appearance
before
the
bottler
as
veazey
rainwater
introduce
him
and
signal
that
it
be
time
to
let
bygone
be
bygone
because
the
principal
owner
be
now
completely
commit
to
the
grand
crusade
of
sell
coca
cola

s
top
lieutenant
tom
glenn
urge
the
bottler
to
buy

trust
company
would
be
happy
to
lend
them
the
money
to
do
so
he
say
and
the
plain
if
unspoken
point
be
that
whatever
manipulation
might
have
take
place
before
a
share
of
coca

bout
of
dark
mood
and
ernest

himself
hopelessly
smitten
he
sent
her
flower
along
with
a
note

forbade
the
date

entirely
too
young
for
a
romance
her

felt
and
they
try
to
discourage

an
interest
in
her
new
suitor
they
return
one
of
ernest
s

it
clear
to
him
that
his
pursuit
of

his
precious
little
girl
in
the
stiff
victorian
fustian
of
the
day
i
admit
that
a
lady
should
always
be
on
her
guard
least
she
over
step
the
bound
of
propriety
but
on
the
other
hand
don
t
think
she
should
be
so
reserve
as
to
permit
her
lover
to
believe
that
she
have
not
the
utmost
confidence
in
him
if
your
father
object
to
our
union
it
be
very
unfortunate
but
why
should
you
be
cool
to
the
man
who
adores
you
at
the
very
time
he
would
most
appreciate
your
love
other
than
their
daughter
s
age
and
the
lack
of
enthusiasm
they
might
have
felt
over
the
idea
of
her
move
to
another
town
there
be
nothing
in
the
record
to
explain
the
winships
disapproval
of
ernest
woodruff
as
a
prospective
groom
for
emie
the
winship
family

it
might
have
be
the
great
gentility
of

though

account
i
will
let
you
know
if
you
think
the
object
in
go
to

be
to
spend
money

play
big
ike
you
have
well

my

i
beg
that
you
will
not
force
me
to
harsh
measure
to
save
you
from
yourself
it
scarcely
seem
possible
that
the
relationship
between
robert
and
his
father
could
go
downhill
from
that
point
but
it
do
the
christmas
holiday
in
ernest
s
view
be
a
long
unproductive
waste
of
time
that
allow
robert
to
slack
off
and
lose
the
last
trace
of
his
meager
momentum
as
a
student
return
to
emory
robert
complain
of
toothache
and
eye
trouble
and
sought
to
postpone
take
his
write
examination
deeply
exasperate
but
unsure
what
else
to
do
his
father
write
the
president
of
emory
dr
james
e
dickey

suggest
that
perhaps
robert
might
benefit
from
rest
his
eye
for
a
week
or
ten
day
before
decide
whether
to
try
to
continue
with
his
second
term
at
the
college
dr
dickey
write
back
to
say
that
robert
s
problem
be
not
one
likely
to
be
cure
by
a
period
of
rest
i
do
not
think
it
advisable
dr
dickey
write
for
him
to
return
to
college
this
term
as
he
have
not
do
satisfactory
work
and
cannot
therefore
make
up
what
he
would
lose
before
return
again
he
have
never
learn
to
apply
himself
which
together
with
very
frequent
absence
make
it
impossible
for
him
to
succeed
as
a
student
in
other
word
robert
be
be
dismiss
he

and
walter
white
quickly
persuade
young
woodruff
that

would
be
smart
to
put
its

team
out
to

switch

of
modern
motorize

ice
and
coal
be
perfectly
adequate
and
that
the
acquisition
of
a
fleet
of
truck
be
a
wild
irresponsible
extravagance
on
october
robert

in
a
fancy
ceremony
the
most
brilliant
social

live
robert
quit
atlantic
ice
coal
and
go
to
work
for
walter
white
his
father
be
surprised
and
disturbed
by
his
decision
and
try
to
talk
him
out
of
it
he
thought
i
be
make
a
mistake
and
told
me
that
i
have
no
sale
ability
and
be
sure
to
fail
robert
report
later
his

also
remind
him
of
the
low
social
esteem
and
reputation
for
shaky
ethic
associate
with
car
and
truck
salesman
and
urge
him
to
reconsider
and
go
into
banking
bitter
and
angry
robert
snap
at
his
father
that
as
far
as
he
knew
the
atlanta
federal
penitentiary
have
no
automobile
executive
behind
its
bar
though
it
held
quite
a
few
banker
walter
white
have
a
practical
reason
for
hire
bob
woodruff
the
young
fellow
knew
everyone
in
atlanta
knew
how
to
open
door
and
gain
access
in
a
town
that
be
still
a
bit
provincial
and
distrustful
of
outsider
the
way
white
have
it
figure
woodruff
could
do
the
cleveland
base
trucking
company
a
great
deal
of
good
just
by
arrange
introduction
even
if
he
eventually
make
up
with
his
father
and
go
into
banking
but
woodruff
surprised
white
he
turn
out
to
be
a
good
salesman
woodruff
sell
truck
to
several
company
in
atlanta
and
then
travel
across
georgia
call
on
county
commissioner
convincing
them
to
buy
sturdy
reliable
white
truck
that
could
survive
the
rut
and
bump
of
the
state
s
mostly
unpaved
road
he
learn
that
the
county
run
by
lone
commissioner
be
his
best
bet
because
the
decision
to
buy
be
in
the
hand
of
one
man
i
don
t
waste
any
time
with
the
wrong
fellow
he
once
told
an
associate
explain
that
it
paid
to
get
to
know
the
top
people
in
an
organization
the
decision
maker
rather
than
spend
time
with
their
underling
and
he
show
initiative
one
of
the
thing
that
have
struck
robert
on
his
trip
out
west
with
his
father
be
the
lazy
pace
and
discomfort
of
the
horse
drawn
stagecoach
that
carry
group
in
and
out
of
yellowstone
park
think
that
white
bus
would
be
an
improvement
he
call
on
the
company
that
ran
the
tour
and
try
to
get
them
to
switch
it
turn
out
the
tour
operator
like
the
slow
old
fashion
method
because
they
also
ran
the
lodge
near
old
faithful
where
tourist
have
to
pay
to
spend
the
night
when
they
decline
to
buy
bus
from
him
however
woodruff
refuse
to
accept
their
answer
he
take
his
case
all
the
way
to
the
federal
park
commission
in
washington
and
won
woodruff
be

quickly
from
salesman
in
white

the
age
of

plus
expense
and

the
most
strike
aspect
of
woodruff

early
career
at

not
aware
of
the
first
step
his

take
in
the
tricky
complicate
process
that
drew
him
back
to

in
the
spring
of
ernest
be
travel
around
georgia
buying
up
all
the

he
could
find
prepare
for
the
showdown
with
his
wall
street
partner
over
control
of
the
company
at
one
point
when
he
laid
hand
on
a
block
of
three
thousand
share
ernest
sign
the
security
over
to
his
three

without
bother
to
tell
them
robert
become
the
owner
of
a
thousand
share
of
coca
cola
and
didn
t
even
know
it
in
fact
for
all
his
claim
to
the
contrary
later
in
his
life
the
truth
be
that
robert
have
no
idea
how
much
coca
cola
stock
he
own
and
little
interest
in
find
out
unlike
his
father
robert
be
not
born
with
the
instinct
of
a
financier
his
aptitude
be
for
sale
and
promotion
and
manage
men
not
for
the
hard
eyed
work
of
play
the
stock
market
he
borrow
money
and
bought
security
and
then
tend
to
leave
them
in
a
desk
drawer
dusty
and
forgotten
during
the
first
three
year
of
his
father
s
involvement
with
the
coca
cola
company
robert
played
no
role
at
all
in
the
business
he
picked
up
a
few
block
of
coca
cola
stock
here
and
there
some
of
it
in
the
form
of
the
special
share
available
to
the
shareholder
and
director
of
his
father
s
bank
trust
company
but
he
be
not
a
very
big
investor
it
be
not
until
the
fall
of
when
ernest
form
his
hold
company
coca
cola
international
that
robert
bought
additional
share
and
take
a
hand
in
the
enterprise
and
even
then
he
merely
volunteer
his
name
as
one
of
the
five
director
loyal
to
his
father
there
be
no
way
of
pin
down
the
precise
moment
it
occur
to
ernest
that
he
want
to
make
robert
the
president
of
coca
cola
yet
there
be
no
doubt
it
be
ernest
who
make
the
decision
the
pretense
that
he
be
a
passive
bystander
or
that
he
somehow
object
to
robert
get
the
job
be
simply
absurd
after
defeat
his
wall
street
rival
ernest
woodruff
enjoy
immense
virtually
unfettered
power
over
the
affair
of

do
nothing
could

without
his

and
approval
accord
to
a
letter

private
paper

of
his

closest
associate
the
issue
of
give
him
coca
cola
s
presidency
be
a
matter
of
intense
discussion
for
several
week
but
only
because
ernest
worried
that
people
would
think
robert
be
elect
just
because
you
be
his
son
the
concern
be
over
the
appearance
of
nepotism
that
be
not
the
wisdom
of
place
robert
in
the
job

it

with
no

ernest

decide

to
go
forward
the
one
part
of
the
myth
of
robert

return
that
be
more
or
less
true
be
that
several
of
his
father
s
friend
thought
he
would
make
a
good
pick
not
so
much
because
they
believe
he
could
stand
up
to
his
father
no
one
expect
that
but
because
they
thought
he
might
bring
peace
to
the
organization
bradley
do
make
a
trip
to
new

along
with
tom
glenn
and
charles
wickersham
to
urge
robert
to
accept
robert

friend
thought
he
should
take
the
job
too
hop
to
give
his
confidence
a
boost
walter

the
standard
oil
baron
take
robert
out
for
a
round
of
golf
and
promise
to
hire
him
in
any
job
he
want
and
at
any
salary
he
care
to
name
if
thing
didn
t
work
out
in
atlanta
the
important
thing
be
to
try
robert
have
a
chance
teagle
argue
to
unite
the
faction
at
the
coca
cola
company
and
bring
stability
to
the
organization
yet
robert
be
reluctant
as
he
often
say
later
i
didn
t
know
any
more
about
the
soft
drink
business
than
a
pig
know
about
sunday
he
be
not
at
all
sure
his
skill
at
sell
truck
would
translate
to
the
very
different
challenge
of
sell
coca
cola
nor
be
he
confident
that
he
knew
how
to
be
a
good
executive
he
like
to
hire
men
who
appeal
to
him
and
put
them
to
work
without
worry
about
title
and
chain
of
command
hang
the
chart
he
once
explain
to
walter
white
these
men
be
here
to
sell
truck
what
he
really
like
it
seem
be
have
everyone
report
directly
to
him
a
management
style
that
might
not
work
at
the
coca
cola
company
then
there
be
the
question
of
compensation
thanks
to
a
surge
in
commission
robert
calculate
that
he
have
earn
about
in
far
more
than
he
have
ever
make
before
and
far
more
than
the
his
father
and
the
board
of
coca
cola
be
offering
him
to
return
to
atlanta
robert
try
make
a
counteroffer
a
straight
percent
commission
on
any
increase
in
coca
cola
sale
over
current
level
but
his
father
vetoed
the
idea
if
he
come
home
he
would
have
to
accept
a
reduction
in
income
of
nearly
a
year
in
later
year
robert
claimed
he
accepted
the
job
to
recover
loss
he
have
suffer
invest
in
coca
cola
stock
yet
that
be
plainly
not
so
as
he
contemplate
take
the
presidency
of
coca
cola
the
company
s
stock
be
hit
an
all
time
high
of
nearly
double
the
original
offering
price
of
and
he
could
easily
have
sell
out
for
a
handsome
profit
robert
s
personal
portfolio
be
in
fine
shape
not
that
he
be
follow
the
ticker
tape
very
closely
i
be
have
a
very
difficult
time
figure
out
how
much
coca
cola
stock
i
have
and
how
much
coca
cola
international
stock
i
have
and
where
it
be
robert
write
his
secretary
early
in
ask
for
help
in
track
down
his
stock
certificate
look
over
his
dividend
deposit
robert
figure
out
he
must
own
share
and
later
he
learn
to
his
surprise
from
ernest
s
secretary
that
his
father
have
give
him
gift
total
another
share
have
he
wish
robert
could
have
sell
out
then
and
there
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollar
far
contradict
robert
s
memory
the
company
be
not
in
the
dire
financial
strait
he
recall
the
crisis
be
over
the
loan
secure
the
high
price
sugar
be
nearly
paid
off
the

on
common
stock
have
be
restore
and
have
be
hike
from
to
a
share
per
quarter
and
the
company
have
million
in
cash
sit
in
the
treasury
the
simple
truth
be
that
much
as
he
want
to
believe
so
robert
be
not
be
call
to
the
rescue
he
be
be
call
home
by
his
father
and
the
reason
he
accepted
the
job
be
to
prove
to
his
father
that
he
could
do
it
the
first
problem
robert
face
be
an
angry
insurrection
in
howard
candler
s
family
howard
be
content
to
step
aside
but
flora
his
wife
be
beside
herself
this
be
the
second
time
ernest
woodruff
have
plot
to
shove
her
husband
out
of
his
rightful
place
as
president
of
the
coca
cola
company
and
she
have
no
intention
of
go
along
the
fact
that
her
brother
tom
glenn
be
a
party
to
the
scheme
just
make
it
that
much
bad
at
her
urge
howard
told
the
woodruff
that
if
they
want
him
out
as
president
he
would
gladly
go
but
he
also
plan
to
resign
from
the
board
of
director
and
withdraw
completely
from
the
company
s
affair
return
to
atlanta
robert
hasten
out
to
callanwolde
howard
candler
s
mansion
on
briarcliff
road
to
confront
the
angry
couple
the
last
thing
woodruff
want
be
a
flood
of
publicity
suggest
that
the
candlers
be
be
purge
from
the
coca
cola
company
the
transition
need
to
be
smooth
woodruff
urge
howard
to
remain
on
the
board
and
to
take
the
chairmanship
of
a
new
advisory
committee
that
would
help
set
policy
for
the
company
and
determine
its
long
range
strategy
that
howard
and
his
wife
bought
the
idea
be
perhaps
a
measure
of
the
mastery
woodruff
have
achieve
in
the
art
of
persuasion
there
be
little
in
his
proposal
to
mask
the
fact
that
howard
be
be
shunt
aside
to
a
powerless
sinecure
yet
woodruff
argue
forcefully
that
he
need
howard
at
his
side
if
he
hop
to
run
the
company
successfully
in
fact
woodruff
swore
and
there
be
no
indication
he
be
bluffing
that
he
would
refuse
to
take
the
presidency
unless
howard
agree
to
stay
on
and
lend
him
his
personal
support
i
need
help
woodruff
remember
tell
howard
candler
i
need
your
help
and
support
genuinely
convince
howard
agree
others
in
the
family
have
a
hard
time
believe
howard
could
be
so
easily
mollify
his
brother
william
in
particular
be
anxious
to
protest
the
change
of
command
william
have
serve
as
corporate
secretary
of
the
coca
cola
company
until
the
previous
fall
when
he
resign
in
the
wake
of
ernest
woodruff
s
victorious
showdown
with
the
new
york
interest
now
william
be
threaten
to
create
a
scandal
on
howard
s
behalf
and
howard
work
quickly
to
dissuade
him
as
frequently
happens
howard
write
a
mutual
friend
william
do
not
get
a
right
reflection
of
the
situation
and
be
inclined
and
in
fact
declare
it
to
be
his
purpose
to
adopt
a
policy
which
would
be
if
i
be
unable
to
control
him
very
embarrass
to
me
howard
be
able
to
calm
his
brother
by
assure
him
that
it
be
entirely
wrong
for
anybody
to
think
for
one
minute
that
i
be
go
to
be
put
out
of
the
coca

company
mr
robert
woodruff
have
make
it
a
condition
upon
his
come
into
the
company
that
i
stay
with
it
with
howard
on
board
the
path
be
nearly
clear
for
robert
s
election
as
president
as
a
preliminary
step
at
a
coca
cola
stockholder
meeting
in
february
ernest
put
through
a
slate
of
new

that
include
robert

walter
white
he
also
put
robert
on
the
company
s
powerful
executive
committee
one
hurdle
remain
howard
and
his
immediate
kin
might
be
satisfied
but
the
same
could
not
be
say
for
others
in
the
top
rank
while
no
one
be
careless
enough
to
leave
proof
of
an
insurrection
company
record
strongly
suggest
that
ernest
woodruff
have
to
accept
a
final
deal
with
several
other
board

before

of

business
would
be
from
his

s
part
of
the

be
the
notion
that
he
race
into

his

the

that

view

the

dangerous
not
so
much
because
consumer
be
likely
to
notice
a
difference

because
they
might
think
the
coca

company
be
cut
corner
and
lower
its
standard
if
they
found
out

as
they
be
to

the

he
have

an
intensely

even
by

that

robert
a
psychology
buff
might
find
fertile
ground
speculate
about
the
origin
of
woodruff
s
enigmatic
temperament
certainly
it
would
not
be
unusual
for
a
boy
who
continually
displeased
his
father
to
develop
a
variety
of
defense
include
emotional
camouflage
several
of
woodruff
s
friend
and
associate
guess
in
hindsight
that
he
found
it
necessary
to
conceal
a
tender
side
he
inherit
from
his
mother
he
be
not
as
tough
as
his
father
they
thought
but
he
be
fully
capable
of
act
as
if
he
be
which
be
the
next
best
thing
whatever
the
reason
for
it
woodruff
place
a
complicate
and
occasionally
deceptive
persona
into
the
service
of
a
company
whose
very
purpose
be
to
lead
a
dual
existence
to
make
its
name
familiar
while
keep
its
formula
obscure
it
might
be
true
that
any
halfway
competent
chemist
could
manufacture
an
imitation
of
coca
cola
syrup
good
enough
to
fool
the
palate
of
an
expert
but
as
long
as
people
thought
coca
cola
be
special
they
would
continue
demand
it
in
asa
candler

day
his
insinuation
of
black
magic
about

the
fanciful
health
claim
the
flirtation
with
cocaine
eventually
come
very
close
to
destroy
the
company
woodruff
be
from
a
different
generation
with
a
vastly
different
perspective
and
he
be
extremely
cautious
about
coca
cola
s
reputation
he
place
the
great
emphasis
on
the
virtue
of
quality
and
consistency
but
in
his
own
way
woodruff
too
meant
to
give
coca
cola
an
aura
of
mystique
he
want
to
tantalize
the
american
consumer
with
the
idea
that
coca
cola
have
unique
slightly
exotic
property

he

on
a

in

told
his

it
say
there
be
no
expedient
to
which
a
man
will
not
resort
to
avoid
the
real
labor
of
think
lee
expand
the
thought
and
add
his
own
view
be
too
lazy
to

the

people
have
plenty
of
ability
to
act
intelligently
if
they
would
only
think
the
man
who
pitch
coca
cola
to
the
world
be
a
complicate
fellow
indeed
and
that
give
him
something
in
common
with
robert
woodruff
the
two
men
have
met
and
form
a
casual
friendship
in
atlanta
during
lee
s
newspaper
day
they
renew
their
acquaintance
in
the
summer
of
when
woodruff
give
white
motor
company
s
advertising
to
the
agency
a
year
later
after
take
the
rein
at
coca
cola
woodruff
turn
to
lee
and
put
him
in
charge
of
the
account
the
work
archie
lee
do
for
coca
cola
be
remarkable
it
be
not
just
the
technical
excellence
of
the
advertising
although
that
be
certainly
a
factor
lee
hire
the
best
illustrator
of
the
day
and
get
them
to
paint
attractive
original
canvas
more
important
though
he
put
his
fertile
mind
to
work
on
a
philosophy
that
would
give
the
company
s
ad
a
purpose
lee
and
woodruff
spent
hour
together
talk
about
the
challenge
that
confront
them
we
want
to
promote
coca
cola
not
just
as
a
soft
drink
or
even
as
the
lead
soft
drink
woodruff
recall
we
want
to
promote
it
as
something
big
than
just
the
answer
to
thirst
we
want
to
make
it
a
thing
apart
to
sell
it
to
all
segment
of
the
social
structure
as
one
of
the
pleasant
thing
of
life
the
ad
campaign
that
eventually
stitch
coca
cola
into
the
fabric
of
american
society
have
their
origin
in
the
long
conversation
woodruff
and
lee
held
during
the
early
day
of
woodruff
s
presidency
they
talk
in
woodruff
s
office
and
on
the
golf
course
go
hunt
together
take
long
walk
and
sometimes
rode
horse
far
out
into
the
countryside
they
grow
close
so
much
so
that
lee
ask
woodruff
to
be
the
best
man
at
his
wedding
they
enjoy
ponder
the
grand
imponderable
wonder
with
each
other
about
the
meaning
of
life
and
the
existence
of
god
when
they
weren
t
actively
calculate
how
to
sell
more
syrup
lee
once
told
dick
gresham
the
preacher
who
have
be
woodruff
s
roommate
that
the
discussion
he
have
with
woodruff
bridge
the
gap
and
help
him
find
faith

who
later
create
coca

and
who
be
already
famous
for
invent
aunt
jemima
and
the
quaker

man
do
his
first
canvas
for
lee
in
at
the
time
i
hadn
t
the
slightest
idea
of
the
philosophy
of
coca
cola
advertising
sundblom
say
later
but
he
soon
learn
that
in
addition
to
painting
picture
he
be
expect
to
undergo
what
he
call
an
indoctrination
into
lee
s
think
coca
cola
s
primary
color
be
red
of
course
date
back
to
the
bright
paint
asa
candler
chose
for
spruce
up
the
old
beer
keg
and
barrel
he
use
to
ship
his
syrup

familiar
script
of
the
company

logo
be
almost
invariably
render
in
white
on
a
red
background
as
lee
saw
it
though
there
be
a
problem
with
red
it
be
a
hot
color
when
the
whole
point
of
coca
cola
be
refreshment
cool
icy
thirst
quench
refreshment
sam
dobbs
have
grapple
with
the
same
dilemma
year
earlier
he
couldn
t
use
the
red
background
in
bathing
beauty
ad
he
say
because
red
be
not
a
very
cool
appear
color
on
a
hot
day
there
be
no
way
to
eliminate
the
venerable
red
but
lee
decide
to
soften
the
effect
by
add
green
and
white
to
the
mix
i
learn
sundblom
report
that
the
red
white
and
green
combination
be
much
more
than
a
temporary
device
of
harmonious
color
it
have
be
plan
carefully
and
thoughtfully
much
as
a
nation
might
plan
its
flag
red
for
energy
white
for
pure
wholesomeness
green
for
refresh
coolness
sundblom

garb
at
a

fountain
against
a
green
background
the
color
be
envision
as
a
sort
of
emblem
for

he
say
in
time
a
simple
poster
show
a
bottle
of
coke
in
a
snowdrift
against
a
green
background
would
be
sufficient
to
convey
everything
the
company
want
to
say
about
its
product
without
a
single
word
of
text
like
most
advertising
men
lee
believe
in
repetition
certainly
there
be
no
lack
of
familiarity
with
the
name
coca
cola
in
one
recent
year
alone
the

three
million

with
the

prominently
displayed
but
lee
want
a
great
sense
of
uniformity
an
override

to
the
ad
and
promotion
that
would
have
as
one
d

put
it
a

resemblance
lee
come
up
with
the
idea
of
put
the
trademark
in
a
rectangle
and
later
devise
the
round
red
sign
with
the
white
logo
that
eventually
become
the
best
know
commercial
symbol
in
the
world
along
with
simplicity
and
familiarity
lee
want
coca
cola
s
advertising
to
convey
meaning
he
believe
a

alive
and
take
on
a
sort
of
animate
personality
if
it

the
right

he
once
described
how
he

his
five

with
wonderment

come
to
influence
the
conduct
of
the
whole
family
lee
have
nothing
less
in
mind
for
coca

early
in

pull
together
all
of
his
new
idea
and
create

the
ad

a
subtle
but
clear
message
the
bellboy
who
get
his

because
his

the
fancy

worn
by

at
the
ritz

conveyed
a
sense
of
elegance
and
social
distinction
yet
he
seem
to
be
step
forward
and
serve
the
coca

directly
to

as

it
be
not
enough
to
describe
coca

as
a
quality
product
not
enough
to
say
it
taste
good

even
that
it
restore

long
it

encourage

he
predict
confidently
that
the
english
would
be
receptive
to
the
soft
drink
they
like

after
all
and

accustom

horsey
call
them
the
key
to
unlock
europe
the
news
be
exactly
what
woodruff
want
to
hear
but
when
woodruff
begin
reading
the
detail
of
horse
s
write
report
he
could
see
that
the
prospect
be
actually
extremely
discourage
the
list
of
potential
difficulty
be
long
and
daunt
begin
with
the
absence
of
soda
fountain
in
england
unless
they
plan
to
take
the
syrup
home
and
carbonate
it
themselves
horsey
point
out
the
english
would
have
to
enjoy
coca
cola
in
bottle
and
those
bottle
would
be
warm
because
refrigeration
be
virtually
unknown
and
the
english
have
a
deep
seat
traditional
dislike
for
chill
beverage
it
probably
would
take
at
least
three
year
and
worth
of
advertising
just
to
create
a
limited
demand
horsey
say
and
even
then
the
company
s
prospect
be
far
cloud
by
the
likelihood
of
a
backlash
if
its
ad
be
consider
too
brazen
the
english
he
note
disliked
the
show
of
pomp
and
braggadocio
attitude
which
sometimes
distinguishes
the
american
manufacturer
in
foreign
market
give
the
bleak
prospect
of
the
venture
there
be
simply
no
way
woodruff
could
pry
a
half
million
dollar
out
of
his
father
and
the
other
conservative
on
the
board
it
be
not
that
ernest
and
will
bradley
and
the
rest
be
oppose
to
do
business
overseas
they
willingly
give
robert
the
authority
to
begin
start
up
operation
almost
anywhere
he
pleased
they
just
wouldn
t
give
him
the
kind
of
money
he
need
to
do
a
first
class
job
of
get
coca

off
the
ground
at
about
the

time
horsey

on

from

for

the
board
of
director
give
robert
the
green
light
to
start
sell
coca
cola
in
mexico
but
they
also
set
a
strict
cap
of
on
expenditure
and
take
the
unusual
step
of
make
the
limit
part
of
the
formal
corporate
minute
as
with
so
many
thing
in
his
life
woodruff
later
paint
a
veneer
of
myth
over
his
early
activity
on
the
international
front
when
his
father
and
the
board
try
to
block
his
effort
at
overseas
expansion
he
claimed
that
he
defy
them
and
set
up
a
clandestine
foreign

carry
out
his
plan
anyway
the
truth
as
usual
be
a
good
deal
more
complicate
woodruff
do
set
up
a
foreign

he
act
with
the
knowledge
and
permission
of
his
father
and

almost
everything
he

on
a
dangerous
business
venture
there
be
no
question
he
have
an
appetite
for
gamble
he
played

production
figure
the
stake
be
usually
fairly
modest
to
sometimes
a
suit
of
clothes

he
like
the
excitement
and
he
felt
lucky
everything
seem
to

to
his
advantage

his
misadventure

along
with
the

no
one

the

very
well

one
that
seem
to
spring
directly
from
a
dark
page
in
coca
cola
s
past
a
group
of
chemist
in
the
u
s
food
drug
and
insecticide
administration
in
washington
conduct
a
test
on
a
batch
of
merchandise
no
and
found
trace
of
ecgonine
an
alkaloid
in
the
coca

that
could
be
synthesize
to
create
cocaine
the
administration
s
director
of
regulatory
affair
w
g
campbell
say
he
order
the
lab
work
because
of
a
suspicion
that
there
must
be
something
besides
caffeine
in
coca
cola
to
cause
the
very
noticeable
coca
cola
addiction
of
large
number
of
person
nearly
two
decade
after
dr

quit
the

his
proteg
s
be
still
at
work
in
wiley
s
day
ecgonine
have
be
difficult
to
detect
but
advance
in
chemical
analysis
give
his
follower
new
tool
to
carry
on
his
crusade
and
they
be
do
so
alert
to
the
result
of
the
test
and
deeply
alarmed
harold
hirsch
assign
the
coca
cola
company
s
own
chemist
william
heath
to
double
check
the
procedure
for
make

heath
hurry
to
new
jersey
where
the
maywood
chemical
work
still
prepared
no
under

to
his
dismay
he
discover
that
in
spite
of
all
the
rigor
of
the
decocainizing
process
it
be
true
that
a
tiny
bit
of
ecgonine
remain
in
the
residue
even
if
the
distillation
be
perform
twice
not
only
that
but
sophisticated
test
could
detect
a
microscopic
trace
of
cocaine
itself
in
some
of
the
sample
by
heath
s
calculation
the
amount
of
ecgonine
be
infinitesimal
no
more
than
one
part
in
million
in
an
entire
year

supply
of
odd
million
gallon
of
coca

heath
figure
there
might
be
six
hundredth
of
an
ounce
of
cocaine
but
the
finding
be
perilous
nonetheless
the
mere
whisper
of
the
word
cocaine
be
a
public
relation
calamity
in
the
make
after
beating
dr
wiley
in
chattanooga
the
company
have
publish
a
booklet
that
proclaim
there
be
not
one
indivisible
atom
of
cocaine
in
a
whole
ocean
of
coca

how
would
it
look
to
have
to
admit
there
be
an
atom
of
cocaine
in
an
ocean
of
coca
cola
what
would
the
company
s
enemy
and
competitor
have
to
say
about
that
what
fresh
blaze
of
rumor
and
controversy
would
be
ignite
more
ominous
still
there
be
serious
legal
ramification
at
hand
it
seem
unlikely
the
government
would
prosecute
in
the
u
s
court
give
the
minuscule
amount
of
cocaine
and
ecgonine
involve
but
company
official
could
not
be
sure
and
they
grow
especially
nervous
about
the
risk
of
continue
to
ship

no
to
their
overseas

adamant
in
forbid
the

forward

the

of
the

division
of

it
appear
possible
he
might
order
a

then
as
if
the
other
accumulate
pressure
be
not
enough
one
of
the

s
men
make
a
mistake
a
serious
error
in
judgment
that

his
idea
be

thus
avoid
the

not

sell
the

that
be

if

anti

the

would
still
be
underwriting
a
huge
coca

in

at

the

no
move
to
intervene
he

begin
to

some

jones

so
whether
the
coca
cola
company
want
them
to
or
not
it
would
be
my
idea
he
write
that
we
manufacture
a
beer
both
in
bulk
and
in
bottle
and
that
we
make
all
the
accepted
form
both
light
and
dark
so
that
we
might
have
a
full
line
and
meet
the
demand
of
a
vary
population
and
vary
taste
something
told

not
capture

fancy
i
have
just
hit
the
high
spot
in
this
memorandum
he
conclude
so
that
you
may
think
this
matter
over
and
shoot
it
full
of
hole
which
be
just
what
happen
it
be
woodruff
s
conviction
that
the
coca
cola
company
make
and
market
one
product
and
one

he
could
not

no

that
the
carbonate

sic

be
harmful
for

much
could
be
do
in
my
opinion
to
overcome
this
sale
obstacle
by
a
campaign
in
parent
magazine
and
in
the
major
medical

the

would
also
serve
another
worthwhile
purpose
in

as
a
foil
against
any
possible
fear

ill

that
might

relentless
opposition
to
the

of
the

by
anyone

in

where
to
turn
pepsi
cola
have
just
go
bankrupt
for
the
second
time
in
its
existence
and
it
be
little
trouble
for
guth
to
talk
the

handful
of
creditor
into
let
him
buy
the

and
formula
for
the
formula
be
of
no
interest
to
him
at
all
but
the

be
virtually
priceless
by
an
accident
of
history
it
have
never
be
challenged
by
coca
cola
and
no
court
have
ever
rule
that
it
be
an
infringement
pepsi
have
begin
life
around
the
turn
of
the
century
in
new
bern
north
carolina
the
creation
of
a
pharmacist
name
caleb
bradham
who
first
call
it
brad
s
drink
and
later
get
it
register
under
the
trademark
pepsi
cola
there
be
little
question
bradham
be
inspire
by
asa
candler
s
success
with
coca
cola
but
pepsi
differ
at
least
slightly
in
composition
it
contain
pepsin
a
digestive
enzyme
and
be
market
in
its
early
day
mainly
as
a
stomach
soother
bradham
enjoy
a
considerable
success
with
pepsi
around
the
carolina
and
virginia
and
by
he
claimed
to
have
nearly
three
hundred

in
twenty
four
state
bradham
built
a
fine
mansion
in

and
have
five
live
in

but
he
be
one
of
the
many
soft
drink
entrepreneur
ruin
by
sugar
after
world
war
i
why
the
coca
cola
company
fail
to
include
bradham
and
his
drink
among
the
hundred
of
suit
they
file
against
imitator
cannot
be
fully
explain
harold
hirsch
once
remark
that
he
want
to
make
pepsi
a
target
in
the
very
early
day
before
he
and
sam
dobbs
take
charge
of
the
company
s
legal
policy
but
be
overrule
by
john
candler
later
hirsch
underwent
a
curious
change
of
heart
and
testify
under
cross
examination
in
an
infringement
case
against
another
soft
drink
that
he
do
not
believe
the
name
pepsi
cola
infringe
on
coca
cola
s
trademark
the
likeliest
possibility
be
that
by
the
time
hirsch
get
the
opportunity
to
sue
pepsi
the
rival
drink
be
so
well
establish
he
fear
he
might
lose
the
case
the
point
appear
moot
of
course
when
pepsi
go
out
of
business
but
the
existence
of
an
unchallenged
trademark
prove
to
be
a
temptation
in
the
maker
of
taka
kola
lose
an
infringement
suit
try
again
with
takola
and
lose
and
be
on
the
verge
of
defeat
in
a
third
suit
with
vim
kola
when
they
bought
the
right
to
the
name
pepsi
cola
for
a
time
they
use
taka
kola
syrup
to
bottle
and
sell
a
product
they
call
pepsi
cola
they
too
gradually
go
bankrupt
but
not
before
draw
the
notice
of
charlie
guth
fully
aware
of
pepsi
s
odd
past
and
future
promise
guth
believe
he
have
the
perfect
weapon
to
inflict
a
costly
lesson
on
neal
harris
and
the
coca
cola
company
he
have
one
of
loft
s
chemist
mix
up
a
syrup
that
taste
more
or
less
like
coca
cola
s
then
christen
it
pepsi
cola
and
begin
serve
it
at
the
fountain
in
his
candy
store
take
the
bait
the
coca
cola
company
retaliate
at
first
the
reprisal
have
a
frisky
fraternity
boy
air
pose
as
legitimate
customer
some
of
the
company
s
investigator
go
into
loft
mirror
and
happiness
store
order
a
pepsi
take
a
sip
and
loudly
spat
it
out
say
it
taste
awful
when
that
fail
to
work
hirsch
sent
other
investigator
around
who
set
to
work
in
deadly
earnest
try
to
prove
that
guth
s
soda
fountain
be
illegally
substitute
pepsi
in
place
of
coke
the
problem
from
the
coca
cola
company
s
point
of
view
be
that
guth
knew

as
you
have
for
all
their
considerable
shortcoming
though
the
whitehead
have
one
quality
that
appeal
tremendously
to
woodruff
they
have
not
the

whatsoever
in

they
never

in

business
never
give
advice
never
second
guess
a
decision
never
so
much
as
ask
a
question
they
simply
want
to
get
and
spend
their
royalty
from
syrup
sale
and
as
long

from

he
observe
as
if
they

the
whitehead
agree
to
sell
their
stake
as

back
to
the

in
exchange
for
common

from
their
point
of
view
the
trade
be
of
little
consequence
instead
of
a
royalty
they
would
begin
receive
roughly
the
same
amount
of
income
in
the
form
of
regular
dividend
but
for
woodruff
the
deal
have
several
significant
aspect
first
it
give
him
the
leverage
to
force
lupton
to

out
too
as
an
equal

woodruff
now
have
the
ability
to
checkmate
lupton
on
any
matter
that
provoke
a
disagreement
and
rather
than
spend
his
remain
year
fight
the
home
office
the
old
man
quietly
surrender
he
trade
his
right
in
a
stock
deal
similar
to
the

characteristically
ernest
woodruff
oppose
the

with
the

bottler
or
to
put
it
more
precisely
he
kept
up
a
steady
barrage
of
criticism
of
the
way
robert
be
negotiate
the
deal
from
his
farm
outside
richmond
ernest
launch
a
fusillade
of
letter
telegram
and
phone
call
to
his
son
and
other
officer
and
director
of
the
company
warn
that
they
be
be
out
trade
and
pay
too
much
and
be
likely
as
he
say
in
one
letter
to
find
themselves
in
a
jam
refuse
to
bend
to
his

prophecy
of

robert

the

bradley
and
the
other
director
include
ernest
s
long
time

be
his
increasingly
frequent
habit
ernest

the

when
the

be
approve
but
his
sullen
recalcitrance
no
longer
seem
to
carry
much
weight
with
the

make
profit
again
the
board
have
renew
confidence
in
robert
s
judgment
and
the

with
the

marked
the
begin
of
the
end
of
any
far
serious
effort
by
ernest
to
challenge
his
son
over
matter
affect
the
company
finally
and
most
important
robert
woodruff
s
negotiation
with
the
whitehead
brought
him
back
into
close
contact
with
john
sibley
the
lawyer
at
king
spalding
who
have
won
the
parent
bottler
bitter
suit
against
the
coca

company
back
in

the
whitehead
whose
large
block
of
coca
cola
common
stock
now
give
them
a
voice
in
the
company
s
ownership
woodruff
found
that
he
like
sibley
there
be
a
tremendous
amount
of
resentment
and
bad
blood
direct
at
sibley
by
some
of
coca
cola
s
officer
and
director
especially
by
harold
hirsch
who
have
be
so
badly
humiliate
by
sibley
during
the
trial
yet
it
be
one
of
woodruff
s
quality
that
he
be
willing
to
befriend
men
who
have
best
him
in
order
to
take
advantage
of
their
ability
woodruff
come
to
appreciate
sibley
s
temperament
his
utter
discretion
his
innate
conservatism
and
common
sense
and
especially
his
competitive
often
combative
nature
one
that
be
very
much
like
woodruff
s
own
for
ten
year
woodruff
have
be
try
to
assemble
a
team
of
his
own
to
run
the
company
exactly
as
he
want
it
run
and
in
sibley
he
found
the
final
piece
in
the
mosaic
in
the
month
before
and
after
the
whitehead
deal
be
close
woodruff
cultivate
an
intimate
bond
with
sibley
that
last
until
the
two

sibley
come
as

as
anyone

he
be
the

of
his

president

pen

and
his
refusal
to
move
to
wilmington
it
be
say
lead
to
his
replacement
by
sibley
yet
that
be
not
quite
so
woodruff
s
move
to
wilmington
be
partly
a
charade
he
rent
a
house
there
and
have
his
office
furniture
ship
to
a
modest
two
room
suite
of
office
in
the
du
pont
building
leave
the
fourth
floor
at
plum
street
look
a
little
queer
and
forsaken
in
the
word
of
a
secretary
who
stayed
behind
but
woodruff
continued
to
spend
a
great
deal
of
time
in
atlanta
he
would
buy
ticket
and
reserve
train
seat
between
wilmington
and
atlanta
for
day
on
end
just
to
be
sure
he
and
his
men
could
travel
back
and
forth
at
their
convenience
and
he
offer
hirsch
wide
leeway
in
attend
to
his
interest
at
home
the
deeper
problem
aggravate
by
personal
friction
be
sibley
s
fundamental
disagreement
with
the
way
hirsch
be
conduct
the
company
s
legal
business
from
tax
planning
to
political
lobbying
from
renew
the
patent
on
its
bottle
to
formulate
the
strategy
for
fight
off
competitor
hirsch
want
to
finish
the
fight
with
pepsi
it
be
my
desire
he
say
later
to
try
out
the
question
without
any
secondary
question
or
other
matter
be
involve
as
to
whether
pepsi
cola
be
an
infringement
of
coca
cola
hirsch
concede
that
it
be
far
too
late
to
challenge
pepsi
cola
s
trademark
in
the
united
state
where
it
have
be
use
in
various
incarnation
for
several
decade
instead
he
come
up
with
the
idea
of
a
flank
maneuver
an
attack
on
pepsi
in
canada
where
guth
have
just
begin
do
business
one
of
the
key
test
of
a
trademark
s
validity
be
how
long
it
have
be
establish
and
in
canada
unlike
the
united
state
pepsi
be
a
newcomer
little
know
to
the
buying
public
sibley
take
a
dim
view
of
hirsch
s
brainstorm
even
if
it
prove
successful
he
reason
it
would
be
of
no
help
in
the
united
state
and
there
be
no
guarantee
that
it
would
be
successful
sibley
scrounge
around
in
the
coca
cola
company
s
legal
archive
and
found
a
transcript
of
the
testimony
hirsch
have
give
year
earlier
when
he
say
he
do
not
believe
pepsi

be
an

sibley
also
found
a
letter
hirsch
once
write
to
one
of
the
coca
cola
company
s
director
give
the

opinion
if
guth

lawyer
be
clever
enough
to
discover
and
produce
either
document
sibley
figure
the
potential
for
embarrassment
in
the
courtroom
be
huge
use
the
issue
of
residency
in
wilmington
as
a
wedge
sibley
push
hirsch
aside
as
coca

and
take
over
the

to
grant
hirsch
one

favor
for
his
three

the

his

perhaps

on

in
the

in
the

smart
and
hirsch
opt
for
a
quick
two
day
trial
in
which
they
rely
on
what
they
believe
be
the
inescapable
obviousness
of
guth
s
desire
to
steal
coca
cola
s
business
by
peddle
a
confusingly
similar
product
but
they
blunder
trademark
law
be
a
knotty
subject
yet
there
be
one
important
principle
at
the
heart
of
it
that
be
quite
simple
it
be
design
to
protect
the
public
as
well
as
the
manufacturer
in
layman
s
term
the
law
say
consumer
have
a
right
to
get
what
they
expect
when
they
ask
for
a
product
with
a
familiar
trademark
what
complicates
the
issue
be
determine
just
how
similar
a
rival
product
can
be
before
it
cross
the
line
and
improperly
confuses
the
public
the
question
be
highly
subjective
of
course
and
the
coca
cola
company
s
legal
file
bulge
with
the
torture
attempt
of
various
trademark
examiner
and
federal
judge
who
try
to
sort
out
right
and
wrong
and
often
succeed
only
in
sound
faintly
ridiculous
many
judge
take
the
position
in
effect
that
they
might
not
be
able
to
define
infringement
but
knew
it
when
they
saw
it
an
examiner
in
one
case
held
that
ko
co
lem
a
be
an
infringement
and
then
in
a
literal
reversal
volunteer
parenthetically
that
he
thought
lema
koco
would
not
have
be
a
federal
judge
in
one
jurisdiction
found
mitch
o
kola
to
be
an
infringement
while
another
elsewhere
give
a
clean
bill
of
health
to
roxa
cola
the
one
protection
coca
cola
have
against
the
caprice
of
these
judicial
roll
of
the
dice
be
the
presentation
of
evidence
that
ordinary
citizen
found
a
compete
product
so
similar
that
they
be
confuse
by
it
since
the
interest
of
the
public
be
at
stake
the
opinion
of
the
man
and
woman
in
the
street
count
and
other
evidence
be
admissible
as
well
if
another
product
use
similar
packaging
or
color
or
the
same
spencerian
script
or
if
its
salesman
openly
liken
it
to
coca
cola
those
fact
could
also
be
use
in
argue
the
intent
to
infringe
in
the
canadian
case
by
forfeit
the
chance
to
lard
the
record
with
testimony
from
people
who
say
they
mistook
pepsi
for
coca
cola
the
company
left
the
question
of
infringement
solely
up
to
the
judge
and
thus
vulnerable
to
the
second
guess
of
the
appeal
court
hirsch
s
final
victory
for
coca

be
a
shaky

enough

the
tiny
amount
of

but
remarkable
nonetheless
because
it
ignore
the

and
pronounce
what

the
benediction
of
the

pleased
at

irreverent
as

all
through
the
late

as

move
the

him
in
a
different
direction
where
sibley
be
serious
to
the
point
of
fierceness
hayes
be
bouncy
and
blasphemous
constantly
look
for
a
way
to
provoke
a
chuckle
and
with
it
a
shift
in
the

make
his
point
with
perfection
in

of

with
a
letter

it
be
the

half
of

the
problem

because
of

frequently
heavy

after

with
a
mildly
derogatory
reference
to

be
open

enough

it
would
be
an
exaggeration
to

that
sibley

be
lock
in
a
fight
over
the
company
s
future
they
rarely
engage
in

when
they
do

away
before

discrepancy
in

that

have
give

the
two

sort
of
breakdown
nor
be
ernest

inevitably
perhaps
ernest
found
it
impossible
to
disappear
gracefully
from

just
a
few
month
after
the
fine

convincingly
that

the
episode

to
crystallize

from

for
all
his

as
minor
as

in

them
off

average
filing
a

a
week
with
the

into
rival

a
decision
have
to
be
make
and
in
due
course
woodruff
make
it
he
side
with
sibley
those
who
be
surprised
by
woodruff
s
choice
who
wonder
why
he
be
preoccupy
with
the
law
when
he
might
have
be
well
off
building
on
the
company
s
fifty
year
record
of
successful
and
often
brilliant
advertising
and
marketing
fail
to
take
into
account
his
complicate
attitude
toward
the
product
woodruff
have
a
genuine
reverence
for
coca
cola
a
belief
that
it
transcend
the
ordinary
push
and
shove
of
american
commerce
and
occupy
a
special
place
that
deserve
constant
diligent
protection
of
all
the
company
s
legal
rule
the
strictest
be
an
absolute
prohibition
on
any
use
of
the
word
coke
and
it
come
straight
from
woodruff
base
on
his
interpretation
of
justice
holmes
s
decision
in
the
koke
case
woodruff
believe
wrongly
as
it
turn
out
that
the
supreme
court
s
protection
extend
only
to
the
full
trademark
coca
cola
and
not
to
the
familiar
nickname
million
of
american
use
in
order
the
soft
drink
there
be
no
legal
basis
for
woodruff
s
position
just
a
rigid
adherence
to
past
practice
that
border
on
superstition
one
episode
in
particular
illustrate
the
way
woodruff
s
mind
work
it
be
an
open
secret
within
the
company
that
coca
cola
syrup
go
stale
if
it
sat
in
a
fountain
proprietor
s
back
room
too
long
the
natural
inclination
of
the
company
s
salesman
and
jobber
over
the
year
have
be
to
get
shopkeeper
to
buy
the
big
fifty
gallon
barrel
of
syrup
but
the
practice
create
a
problem
with
small
retailer
who
take
month
or
even
year
to
use
up
their
supply
woodruff
be
fully
aware
of
the
problem
he
kept
a
file
in
his
private
paper
marked
fresh
syrup
and
more
of
it
but
he
be
also
acutely
sensitive
to
the
potential
for
damage
if
any
word
of
the
issue
be
breathe
in
public
he
quietly
agree
to
a
new
pricing
policy
design
to
promote
faster
turnover
by
provide
equal
discount
for
small
unit
of
syrup
yet
it
be
not
a
subject
he
care
to
discus
as
a
group
of
officer
in
the
fountain
sale
department
discover
one
morning
when
he
blew
his
top
during
a
meeting
in
his
office
in
wilmington
woodruff
very
definitely
express
himself
one
of
the
participant
record
that
during
the
past
year
there
have
be
far
too
much
discussion
about
test
analysis
ingredient
et
cetera
all
have
to
do
with
the
quality
of
coca
cola
mr
woodruff
take
the
position
that
the
quality
of
coca
cola
today
be
as
always
above
reproach
and
offer
as
evidence
the
fact
that
the
company
be
a
healthy
one
and
have
show
a
rather
good
experience
throughout
the
year
and
that
it
could
not
have
do
so
if
the
quality
of
the
product
broadly
speak
have
not
be
good
woodruff
operate
on
the
thesis
that
coca
cola
represent
an
ideal
a
view
he
be
able
to
hold
with
complete
conviction
at
the
very
same
time
he
take
step
that
be
necessary
to
make
it
well
far
from
be
simpleminded
his
philosophy
demand
an
almost
metaphysical
approach
to
run
the
business
face
competition
most
executive
thought
about
make
change
yet
for
woodruff
that
avenue
be
close
in
his
view
there
could
never
be
such
a
thing
as
a
new
and
improve
coca
cola
for
the
plain
and
inescapable
reason
that
coca
cola
be
already
consider
perfect
the
sanctity
he
accord
the
product
knew
few
bound
when
haddon
sundblom
do
his
illustration
for
the
company
s
ad
for
instance
he
be
under
strict
order
to
deliver
the
canvas
unfinished
so
that
a
draftsman
with
a
fine
eye
for
detail
could
paint
in
the
image
of
the
soft
drink
itself
sundblom
s
broad
creamy
brush
stroke
and
evocation
of
inner
warmth
be
fine
for
create
impression
and
mood
but
the
bottle
of
coca
cola
in
the
picture
have
to
be
an
exact
flawless
reproduction
right
down
to
the
tiny
letter
of
the
trademark
and
patent
registration
sundblom
be
free
to
reshape
the
popular
concept
of
santa
claus
that
be
but
not
to
tamper
with
coca
cola
in
a
way
woodruff
found
himself
trap
by
history
by
create
an
idea
of
the
product
that
go
far
beyond
its
actual
utilitarian
function
that
of
quench
thirst
and
provide
a
mild
lift
from
sugar
and
caffeine
the
company
have
elevate
coca
cola
to
an
ethereal
plane
that
have
little
to
do
with
how
it
taste
or
the
size
of
the
bottle
it
come
in
the
point
wasn
t
to
compete
with
other
soft
drink
or
to
insist
that
coca
cola
be
well
but
to
hold
tight
to
the
precious
illusion
that
coca
cola
be
something
completely
different
above
and
apart
and
of
course
to
sue
anyone
who
disagreed
on
july
more
than
a
year
after
the
trial
justice
maclean

hand
down
his
decision
in

of

company
sibley
be
pleased
with
the
verdict
not
so
much
because
it
be
a
victory
but
because
it
played
into
his
strategy
for
escalate
the
fight
as
badly
as
he
want
to
do
battle
with
pepsi
in
the
united
state
he
have
be
unable
to
find
an
opening
that
would

him
go

would
slip
up
and

him
a
chance

with
serene
confidence
he
assure
woodruff
that
usually
an
unprincipled
concern
if
give
an
opportunity
would
make
a
fundamental
mistake

by

on

meeting
the

true
the

that

the

hearing

make
people

only
of
coca

of
no

that

they

coca
cola
they
ask
for
a

precisely
because
they
have
learn
that
if
they

they
might
get
something
else
and
many
of

want
something
else

it
be
his

his

on
the

sibley

himself
in

in

before
a

of
five
law
lord
much
to
his
amazement
he
learn
that
the
principal
legal
test
they
plan
to
apply
to
the
case
consist
of
look
up
cola
in
the
dictionary
on
behalf
of
his
peer
lord
russell
of
killowen
explain
that
while
question
may
sometimes
arise
as
to
the
extent
to
which
a
court
may
inform
itself
by
reference
to
dictionary
there
can
their
lordship
think
be
no
doubt
that
dictionary
may
properly
be
refer
to
in
order
to
ascertain
not
only
the
meaning
of
a
word
but
also
the
use
to
which
the
thing
if
it
be
a
thing
denote
by
the
word
be
commonly
put
he
wheeze
on
at
some
length
but
his
meaning
be
plain
if
cola
be
in
the
dictionary
the
coca
cola
company
could
have
no
proprietary
right
to
the
use
of
it
and
so
their
lordship
rule
they
apply
a
second
test
to
determine
if
pepsi
cola
s
trademark
unduly
resemble
coca
cola
s
they
take
copy
of
the
two
trademark
and
turn
them
upside
down
as
if
they
be
chinese
character
in
the
analogy
of
one
of
the
lord
to
see
if
the
general
impression
they
make
be
similar
despite
the
tendency
of
word
write
in
script
with
flourish
to
bear
a
general
resemblance
to
each
other
the
lord
conclude
it
would
be
difficult
indeed
impossible
for
the
word
pepsi
to
be
mistaken
for
the
word
coca
they
found
in
favor
of
pepsi
on
all
count
thus
the
coca
cola
company
s
decade
long
attempt
to
put

out
of

come

quite

the

the

an

and
it
brought
up
an

question
what
if
the
company
could
prove
that
coca
cola
be
good
for

through
its

the

why
not
drop
the

fight
the

provoke
a
heavy
debate
at
the
top

of
the

the

in
particular
warn
that
it
be
dangerous
to
make

claim
on

one
of
the
young

seize
on
a

point
ben
oehlert
have
join

oehlert
have
demonstrate
an
irreverent
contrarian
streak
from
the
very
start
when
woodruff
give
him
a
bonus
at
the
end
of
his
first
year
he
express
his
thanks
and
in
the
same
letter
argue
that
such
payment
be
inherently
unfair
and
ought
to
be
discontinue
immediately
as
he
contemplate
the
ftc
inquiry
oehlert
found
himself
look
ahead
and
see
a
large
picture
europe
be
now
engulfed
in
war
and
the
united
state
be
sure
to
be
drawn
into
the
hostility
if
the
company
have
learn
anything
from
world
war
i
if
a
prediction
could
be
make
with
utter
certainty
it
be
that
war
would
bring
shortage
and
curtail
business
nonessential
product
would
face
cutback
and
quota
and
coca
cola
would
suffer
perhaps
drastically
but
not
if
the
government
could
be
persuade
that
coca
cola
be
vital
to
the
war
effort
the
ftc
eventually
drop
its
complaint
but
for
oehlert
the
episode
be
just
a
begin
he
be
completely
serious
about
building
a
case
that
coca
cola
be
an
essential
product
in
wartime
hop
to
find
ally
he
sent
a
memo
to
harrison

ask
for
material
in

of

jones
reply
that
the
whole
idea
be
sheer
lunacy
likely
to
backfire
next
oehlert
try
ralph
hayes
there
be
not
the

in
my

i
be
sure
there
be
none
in
yours
he
write

that
our

make
a
very
real
contribution
not
only
to
the

also
to
its

as
well
as
to
the
morale
of
both
the
civilian

the

oehlert
say
should

hayes
promptly
dubbed
the

oehlert

folly
yet
he
have
to
admit
the
young

make
an

hayes
be

that
many

as
a
desirable
alternative
to

for

it
be
a
difficult
point
to
exploit

certainly
one
worth
keep
in

he
quietly
instruct

only
it

that
there

there
be
doubt
within

about
the

must
be
an

if
it
be
he
say
an
affection
for

will
carry
through
the
life
of
the
young
men
now
in
the

and
through
them
will
be
reflect
in
generation
to
come
the

should
strain
every
resource
to
get
and
keep
all
of
this
army

which
it
possibly
can

add
regardless
of
the
cost
woodruff
agree
anywhere
for

remain
the

even
then
logistical
headache
threaten
to
make
it
a
hollow
promise
the
product
be
simply
too
bulky
to
send

take
up

where
the

go
on
in
the

theater
and
it

i
have

later
and
more
of

vote
for

that
suit
the

perfectly
he
thought

to

the

each

stiffly
shook

there
be
no

i
told
him
bacon
say
not
to

us
peculiar
if

bacon
ask

told
keith
the

for
the
american

if
keith
would
cooperate
it
would

because
he
be
a
german
he
would
no

in

give
the
obvious
high
stand
he
have

probably
should
have
understood
the

instead
he

keith

almost
certainly
would
have
result
in
the
dismantle
of

but
keith
and
oppenhoff
have
step
in
and
persuade
the

the

all
to

he
could

admonish
him
lightly
that

him
firmly
i
don
t
agree
with
you
as
to
the
large

size
woodruff
be
gamble
that
economic
factor
would
allow
him
to
keep
sell
six

of

for
a

while
pepsi

toward

not
that

he
be
try
as
hard
as
ever
to
see
over
the
next

he
surprised
his

with
a

prediction
that
within
twenty
five
year

sale
of

would
surpass
those
in

be
a
simple
matter
he

of
billion
mouth
versus
million
but
as
ever
the
question
of
how
to
reach
those
customer
provoke
fierce
contentiousness
within

final
he
make
a
point
of
leave
atlanta
for

out

that
he
could
take
along
on

it

at

he
have
a

large
a

that

quite
the
opposite

guaranteed
a
rocky
start
by

that

in

woodruff
take
the
unusual
step
of
make
a
formal
speech
at
one
of
the
company
s
sale
meeting
stand
on
his
foot
for
nearly
an
hour
in
the
ballroom
of
the
brookhaven
country
club
in
atlanta
he
give
an
ardent
pep
talk
about
coca
cola
and
then
go
off
the
record
as
he
put
it
to
discus
hobbs
mind
you
he
say
i
m
not
sing
a
swan
song
i
expect
to
be
around
here
for
a
long
time
i
ll
tell
you
a
secret
and
it
s
no
secret
to
a
number
of
you
but
one
of
the
great
struggle
i
m
have
be
restrain
myself
from
jumping
in
and
try
to
run
the
business
that
job
as
i
ve
told
you
have
be
hand
to
mr
hobbs
some
of
the
listener
take
woodruff
at
his
word
but
others
heard
an
echo
of
doubt
if
hobbs
be
do
a
good
job
they
wonder
why
do
woodruff
have
to
speak
up
for
him
and
if
woodruff
be
so
well
pleased
with
hobbs
then
why
be
he
have
such
a
struggle
let
go
the
speech
have
a
curiously
contradictory
effect
though
woodruff
reaffirm
explicitly
that
hobbs
would
continue
as
president
he
also
seem
to
be
make
an
admission
of
sort
that
hobbs
have
be
a
flaw
choice
it
be
an
invitation
for
uncertainty
within
the
company
a
signal
that
hobbs
s
authority
be
limited
and
suspect
and
that
his
decision
be
open
to
question
and
even
subversion
woodruff
end
his
period
of
exile
and
begin
roam
the
fourth
floor
at
plum
street
again
cigar
glow
drop
into

and
check
up
on

he
present
a

figure
the
bos
as
he
be
know
to
one
and
all
whose
age
and
experience
and
absolute
control
over
the
board
of
director
make
hobbs
look
juvenile
and
feeble
by
comparison
soon
a
new
office
joke
be
make
the
round
the
trouble
with
hobbs
it
go
be
he
think
he
s
president
aware
of
the
undermine
effect
his
renew
presence
have
on
hobbs
woodruff
ask
his
friend
and
adviser
if
he
be
do
the
right
thing
not
surprisingly
they
reassure
him
he
be
after
two
decade
it
be
second
nature
for
most
of
the
company
s
executive
to
depend
on
woodruff
for
guidance
and
he
welcome
their
reliance
one
of
the
mistake
that
hobbs
make
recall
joe
jones
woodruff
s
chief
of
staff
be
he
didn
t
check
in
with
mr
woodruff
it
be
fine
for
woodruff
not
to
be
call
him
up
every
day
but
he
damn
well
expect
to
hear
from
hobbs
and
that
didn
t
happen
eventually
hobbs
grow
gun
shy
and
begin
duck
decision
ralph
hayes
go
to
him
with
an
idea
for
an
advertising
campaign
for
instance
and
complain
that
he
couldn
t
get
hobbs
to
give
a
thumb
up
or
down
you
be
the
top
knocker
around
here
he
admonish
hobbs
angrily
and
i
think
you
ought
to
be
either
for
or
against
it
instead
of
just
let
it
get
kick
up
and
down
the
hall
until
it
s
do
to
death
as
the
month
pass
hobbs
s
stand
with
woodruff
become
an
open
question
in
the
company
one
night
on
a
trip
to
new
york
hughes
spalding
watch
in
intense
discomfort
as
woodruff
and
hobbs
start
drinking
heavily
at
dinner
and
fell
into
an
ugly
argument
one
that
degenerate
as
they
get
progressively
tipsier
until
hobbs
begin
curse
and
call
woodruff
name
spalding
who
be
on
the
wagon
fear
his
proteg
have
burn
his
bridge
the
next
morning
woodruff
have
trouble
remember
the
particular
of
the
spat
and
ask
spalding
what
do
he
say
about
me
spalding
reply
i
m
not
tell
you
an
immediate
fire
be
avert
but
it
be
plain
that
hobbs
have
move
permanently
to
woodruff
s
bad
side
the
simplest
solution
might
have
be
to
replace
hobbs
but
woodruff
be
reluctant
to
admit
he
d
make
a
mistake
especially
so
soon
after
acklin
s
collapse
he
hat
dismiss
people
and
in
one
important
respect
the
presence
of

and

a

team
be
one
surefire
method
of
keep

at

so
hobbs
stayed
on

the
company

deeper
into
a
state
of
paralysis
with
painful

the

proven
themselves
during

reason

up

utterly
frozen
from
the

the
wild
flutter

wing
a
split
second
before
he
saw
the
bird
explode
into
a

for
a
double
a
plump
brown
bird
with
each
shot
it
be
not
hard
to
understand
why
woodruff
love
the
hunt
so
much
simply
be
outdoors
in
the
pristine
air
of
the

competitive
place
at
the

the

two

do
you
kill

do
you
shoot

a
test
of
skill

by
subtle
extension
of
manliness
a

often
take
his
limit
without
a

waste

of
question
could
be
an
uncomfortable
exercise
for
those
who
have
miss
finally
ichauway
allow
woodruff
to
be
generous
and
to
benefit
at
the

time
from
generosity

dark
cousin

creation
of
a
sense
of
obligation
on
the
part
of

his
visitor
souvenir
of
neatly
clean
filet
of

the

any

the

the

motivate
by

the

would
have
an
important
impact
on
the
control
of
the

company
and
woodruff
be
smart
enough
to
recognize
that
charity
be
an
instrument
he
could
use
to

in

woodruff
be
eager
to
see
his

only
so
long

remain

under

give
money
away
wisely
woodruff
come
to
believe
be
even
harder
than
earn
it
in
the
first
place
after
long
talk
with
mcgill
emory
university
s
mizell
ralph
hayes
and
others
he
devise
the
underpinnings
of
a
theory
to
guide
his
philanthropy
he
want
to
foster
progress
in
the
region
by
improve
people
s
body

mind
and
he
want
others
with
wealth
to

if
his
family
sell
their
coca
cola
stock
to
raise
money
for
good
cause
woodruff
reckon
they
would
be
limit
themselves
to
one
time
donation
to
beneficiary
beyond
their
control
and
they
would
be
do
very
little
to
inspire
others
to
give
instead
woodruff
envision
maintain
the

it
soon
become

hallmark
of

style
that
he
would
give
half
but
only
half
of
the
money
need
for

that
interested
him
see
their
potential
as
a
mean
of
maintain

over
the
company
woodruff
set
out
to
build
a
network
of

foundation
whose
director
would
answer
to
him
and
whose

in

example
would
dissolve

begin

a
long
list
of
criticism
of
the
way
the

be
be
run
it
do
not
bother
him
in

that
burke

be
there
too
listen
to
the
tirade
with
mount
irritation
nor
do
it
seem
to
bother
woodruff
if
you
think
you
can
do
a
well
job
woodruff
told
robinson
maybe
you
ought
to
have
the
chance
the

be
not
long
in
come
nicholson
be
popular
within
the

in
the
apt

of
ralph

a

once
ask
him

he
reply
simply
i
m
do
what
the
bos
want
me
to
do
it
be
obvious
however
that
the

could
no
longer

to
stand
pat
by

would
be

ocean
liner
in

north
atlantic
on
a
stormy
night
as
she
pitch
and
roll
in
the
heavy
sea
with
her
great
engine
slow
and
she
would
be
just
make
way
and
as
i
have
stood
alone
there
peer
into
the
inky
blackness
of
the
mountainous
sea
ahead
i
ve
thought
about
our
business
in
these
change
time
if
the
ship
be
strong
and
seaworthy
and
if
the
crew
be
stout
hearted
and
courageous
she
ride
out
the
storm
and
the
weather
clear
and
the
sea
calm
and
on
the
horizon
there
come
the
faint
glimmer
of
another
day
and
soon
a
bright
streak
of
morning
sun
and
the
officer
train
their
instrument
upon
it
their
position
be
fix
and
a
firm
voice
go
down
the
speak
tube
to
the
engine
room
full

ahead
and
so
it
echo
throughout
the

and
once
more
her
giant
engine
quiver
and
vibrate
with
life
as
her
bow
once
more
go
crash
through
the
sea
at
full
speed
to
her
destination
it
be
impossible
not
to
mock
talley
for
such
ponderous
metaphor
of
course
especially
when
they
come
from
such
a
diminutive
source
he
travel
with
a
custom
built
two
third
size
lectern
he
could
see
over
and
his
stature
make
him
the
subject
of
considerable
tease
when
he
go
hunt
at
ichauway
astride
a
mount
no
big
than
a
shetland
pony
woodruff
like
to
look
over
at
him
in
the
tall
grass
and
yell
lee
get
on
your
horse
and
talley
would
respond
with
unfailing
good
cheer
i
be
yet
talley
could
be
very
determine
his
sunny
disposition
and
gentle
demeanor
disguise
a
tough
inner
core
an
underling
remember
ask
talley
once
for
some
time
to
walk
around
the
block
and
think
over
a
new
assignment
before
accept
well
make
it
a
short
block
talley
snap
his
smile
disappear
because
the
decision
s
already
be
make
like
everyone
else
who
get
to
the
top
of
the
company
talley
be
extremely
deferential
with
woodruff
but
he
also
have
the
gumption
to
disagree
with
him
when
necessary
and
push
him
to
change
his
mind
i
believe
for
the
first
time
in
a
good
while
mr

be
pleased
with
his

a

ralph

not
long
after
talley
take
over
and
it
be
true
many

later
contemplate
the

in

for
its

as

the
strike
thing
be
what

to

about
the

attitude
toward

i
certainly
have
never

mcgill
write
woodruff
at

point
but
whatever
my
feeling
i
be
go
to
try
to
stay
by
the
law
and
the
court
woodruff
like
to

an
old
say
in

to
explain
his

ah
try
to
cooperate
with
the
inevitable
unlike
so
many
of
their
counterpart
in
the
south
the
coca

crowd
grudgingly
accepted
the
fact
that
delay
be
futile
one
day
in
the
spring
of
just
after
the

you
arrange

us
a

more

to
mcgill

recount
the

year
later
eisenhower
cocked
an

at

how
much
time
he
have
in

sheepishly

guess

come
much
faster

that

the

s
great
champion
in
congress
have
to
stand
for

the

because
of
his
age
seventy
one
and
his
increase
remoteness
from
the
voter
of
the
state
he
be
consider
vulnerable
the
most
powerful
of
his
potential
challenger
be
herman
talmadge
the
son
and
political
heir
of
eugene
talmadge
the
wild
man
from
sugar
creek
a
four
term
governor
whose
fiery
oratory
red
suspender
and
overt
bigotry
make
him
one
of
the
south
s
most
notorious
and
popular
public
figure
until
his
death
in
in
order
to
keep
herman
talmadge
from
run
against
senator
george
woodruff
be
prepared
to
cut
a
deal
the
young
talmadge
have
won
a
special
election
to
finish
out
the
last
two
year
of
his
father
s
final
term
as
governor
and
woodruff
hop
to
persuade
him
to
pas
up
the
senate
race
in
favor
of
run
for
reelection
to
a
full
four
year
term
of
his
own
woodruff
also
want
the
general
assembly
to
pas
a
general
sale
tax
that
would
eliminate
once
and
for
all
any
chance
of
a
special
levy
on
soft
drink
the
question
be
what
talmadge
might
ask
in
return
on
a
late
summer
afternoon
in
september
hughes
spalding
invite
talmadge
to
his
farm
on
the
chattahoochee
river
outside
atlanta
for
a
talk
talmadge
confide
that
he
be
willing
to
run
for
governor
again
and
favor
the
adoption
of
a
percent
sale
tax
the
problem
talmadge
explain
be
that
support
such
a
tax
would
hurt
him
with
the
voter
he
want
spalding
s
promise
and
woodruff
s
that
the
coca
cola
company
would
back
him
to
the
hilt
for
the
senate
seat
when
it
come
open
in
or
earlier
if
george
die
or
retire
we
will
have
to
make
a
pretty
firm
commitment
spalding
report
to
woodruff
that
when
a
vacancy
do
occur
in
the
united
state
senate
we
will
go
down
the
line
for
him
that
s
about
the
way
it
stand
woodruff
accepted
the
term
talmadge
won
the
governor
s
race
in
with
the
company
s
backing
and
lead
a
successful
fight
the
next
year
for
passage
of
the
sale
tax
the
deal
might
have
be
a
small
footnote
of
interest
only
to
georgia
s
taxpayer
except
that
it
link
the
coca
cola
company
to
talmadge
s
other
politics
as
well
which
include
staunch
implacable
resistance
to
the
civil
right
movement
unlike
his
father
talmadge
do
not
shout
the
word
nigger
at
rally
or
point
to
black
child
and
call
them
the
enemy
but
his
effort
be
no
less
hostile
to
the
advancement
of
black
people
a
lawyer
by
training
he
become
one
of
the
south

lead
advocate
of
state
right
and
the
notion
that
separate
but
equal
could
somehow
be
salvage
in
the
court
his
famous
pamphlet
you
and
segregation
set
it
all
out
in
black
and
white
the
company
have
no
leverage
at
all
with
talmadge
and
there
be
no
indication
woodruff
or
spalding
ever
try
to
get
him
to
soften
his
view
on
race
on
the
contrary
woodruff
praise
talmadge
publicly
once
toast
him
at
a
formal
dinner
as
the
best
governor
georgia

a
line
that
later
cause
the

by
a
pair
of
proteg

marvin

escalate
the

the

through
the
rest
of
the
decade
in

make
good
on
the

george
be
now
seventy
eight
and
ail
but
unwilling
to
accept
the
idea
of
retirement
he
have
serve
in
the
senate
for
more
than
a
third
of
a
century
and
believe
he
be
still
invincible
at
the
poll
as
the
campaign
take
shape
most
independent
observer
agree
that
george
be
doom
while
the
senator
be
attend
to
his
duty
in
washington
talmadge
have
be
stump
the

for
two
full

raise
money
lock
up

and
lay
the
foundation
for
a
powerful
challenge
george
have
scarcely
set
foot
in
his
home
state
and
be
thoroughly
out
of
touch
with
the
electorate
when
the
senator
belatedly
begin
campaign
the
result
be
embarrass
old
walter
come
up
here
willie
barron
the
venerable
coca

bottler
in

one
of
the
few
people
he
still
know
he
hasn
t
be
in
floyd
county
in
twenty
year
the
senator
be
far
from
healthy
and
he
ramble
badly
in
some
of
his
campaign
speech
even
break
down
in
tear
once
or
twice
woodruff
spoke
to
the
senator
personally
gently
urge
him
to
give
up
gracefully
when
the
senator
fail
to
heed
the
message
woodruff
sent
an
emissary
robert
troutman
to
explain
in
clearer
more
forceful
term
that
the
game
be
up
there
would
be
no
support
for
another
campaign
george
reluctantly
withdrew
from
the
race
and
woodruff
help
arrange
a
face
save
sinecure
an
appointment
for
george
to
be
president
eisenhower
s
personal
representative
to
nato
the
great
likelihood
be
that
george
would
have
lose
to
talmadge
even
if
woodruff
and
the
coca
cola
company
and
all
the
other
big
mule
in
atlanta
have
rally
to
the

side
and
it
may
be
that
by
push
george
into
retirement
woodruff
do
him
a
favor
still
there
be
a
whiff
of
betrayal
to
the
affair
a
feel
that

george
be
be
jettison
in

all
the

do
over

look
at

woodruff
drove
over
to
spend
saturday
with

be
immediately
struck
unfavorably
by
the
fact
that

do
not
hunt
pat
nixon
go
out
and
actually
get
a
bird
woodruff
report
later
to
eisenhower

her
husband
be
not
a
shooter
and
that
be
a
bad
sign
make
matter
bad
nixon
commit
a
gaffe
when
he
sent
a
follow
up
note
a
few
day
later
thank
woodruff
for
give
him
a
jar
of

as
any
halfway
attentive
yankee
visitor
should
have
know
the
plantation
s
special
delicacy
be
pure
georgia
cane
syrup
not
sorghum
and
woodruff
whose
life
s
work
after
all
center
on
syrup
be
always
irritated
if
someone
fail
to
make
the
distinction
there
be
a
very
great
difference
he
write
nixon
between
our
syrup
and

which
be
generally
a
heavy
bitter
sweet
substance
perhaps
woodruff
add
i
will
get
you
down
here
sometime
and
teach
you
more
about
these
specialty
of
the
deep
south
privately
woodruff
dismiss
nixon
as
a
man

a

they
never
have
any
rapport
joe
jones
recall
that
s
the
best
way
to
put
it
i
think
nixon
just
wasn
t
his
kind
of
folk
during
the
primary
season
woodruff
threw
his

then
sent

after
john

the

woodruff
have
try
to
maintain
a
cordial
relationship
with
the
occupant
of
the
white
house
and
if
that
be
not
possible
he
found
intermediary
to
build
bridge

look
after
the

woodruff

that

to
strip
the

ben
oehlert
whose
brazen
attempt

make
coca

a
military
necessity
have
succeed
so
brilliantly
during
world
war
ii
spearhead
the
company
s
effort
summon
new
power
to
bend
logic
oehlert
first
argue
that
the
company
could
satisfy
the
law
by
put
a
label
on
its
bottle
that
say
simply
contains
coca
cola
syrup
and
carbonate
water
the
lone
ingredient
in
coca
cola
oehlert
reason
be
coca
cola
syrup
this
the
fda
refuse
to
buy
next
oehlert
try
a
volley
of
assertion
since
coca
cola
be
percent
sugar
and
water
he
told
the
fda
the
remain
ingredient
be
too
minor
to
merit
disclosure
people
already
knew
what
be
in
coca
cola
he
add
and
if
they
didn
t
it
be
because
they
didn
t
care
and
besides
the
only
significant
difference
between
coke
and
other
cola
be
in
the
flavoring
which
be
exempt
from
disclosure
anyway
these
pleading
also
fell
on
deaf
ear
oehlert
s
final
argument
be
a
masterpiece
since
coca
cola
have
always
contain
caffeine
he
assert
it
be
by
legal
definition
a
caffeinated
soft
drink
and
thus
there
be
no
reason
to
list
caffeine
on
the
label
just
as
it
be
unnecessary
to
identify
caffeine
as
an
ingredient
in
coffee
oehlert
say
it
be
understood
that
caffeine
be
a
constituent
element
of
cola
beverage
and
proclaim
that
fact
on
the
side
of
the

would
be
redundant
the

be
unmoved

coolidge

i
be
always
tempt
myself
to

such
type

have
felt
that
when

my

a
fury
in
woodruff
that

rarely

if
some

nineteenth

have
appear
from

accuse
him
of

hold
i
wouldn

want

of
who
profit

planter
woodruff
fume
dictate
a
response
to

my
impression
be
that
money
receive
from

form
the

of
several
new
england
especially
massachusetts

before

answer
in

woodruff
stop

review
his
activity
of
the
past
several
year
perhaps
he
could
have
do
more
he
reflect
but
certainly
he
have
no
apology
to
make
to
a
liberal
egghead
from
boston
especially
one
who
declare
with
such
rectitude
that
he
be
deny
himself
the
experience
of
public
involvement
in
the
civil
right
struggle

desperately
for
a
nimble
way

break
his

when
his

secretary
griffin
bell
then
a
young
lawyer
fresh
from

come
up
with
an
inspiration

the

commission
to

around

the

would
think
carefully
about
the
consequence
and
arrive
at
the
conclusion
that
the
school
must
remain
open
even
if
it
meant
integration
the
perfect
chairman
would
have
to

to

enough
the

worried
austin
more
than
the
other

he
give
the
go
ahead
but
as

he
grow

in

a
few
day
before
the

fret
that
he
d
make
a

he
be
greatly
relieve
to

a

on

when
the

come
up
and
later
he
told
a

it
be
the

he
believe
he
finally
have
it
make
six
month
afterward
on
may
austin
be

his

be
so
fast

naturally
arouse
the

bitter
over
the
loss
of

thought
austin
must
be

others
be
not
so
inventive

wicked

austin
rekindle
the

misgiving
that
have

so
many
of

act
as
a
buffer
between
him
and

it
prove
to
be
a
useful
arrangement
because
austin

an

style
to
the

that
caught
people
by
surprise
after

history
able
to
pull
excalibur
from
the
rock
austin
s
vantage
point
be
entirely
different
he
paid
the
appropriate
courtesy
to
woodruff
but
as
he
look
around
the
company
he
saw
serious
chronic
problem
that
demand
fix
many
of
them
woodruff

fault
the

suffer
from
the

cronyism
that
crept
in
whenever
one
man
rule
an
institution
for
so
many
year
austin
believe
he
saw
the
talleys
as
part
of
a
vein
of
nepotism
that
ran
through
the

thwart
the
career
of
abler
men
as
he
near
his

make
a
conscious
decision
that
he
could
no
longer
afford
to
be
friendly
with
his
colleague
know
he
have
stable
to
clean
out
he
adopt
an
unsmiling
demeanor
and
begin
keep
his
distance
almost
to
the
point
of
rudeness
the
act
be
so
effective
that
a
reporter
described
him
in
a
profile
as
a
gaunt
grim
man
when
in
truth
he
be
quite
upbeat
and
flamboyant
by
nature
not
surprisingly
woodruff

ardor
toward
austin

you
can
always
tell
a
harvard

you
can

austin

the

of

among
woodruff

one
night
over

woodruff

on
austin
at
length
pound
home
the
point
that
business
leader
ought

a

of
humility
afterward
a

paul
come
back
with
smoke
come
out
of
both

yet
woodruff
still
admire
the

the
fact
be
that
no
one
else
have
be

to
take
talley

place
have
he

the

need
the
kind
of
fresh

austin

woodruff
concede
they
might
be
right
when
the

elevate
austin

woodruff

for
the

the
company

difficulty
he
be
on
the
payroll
solely
because
he
be
one
of

politely

otherwise
austin

than

root
of
the
friction
between
austin
and
woodruff
be
a
fundamental
rift
over
the
question
of
ownership
austin
saw
the
coca

company
as
a
publicly
held
corporation
answerable
to
its
thousand
of

woodruff
s
view
the
polar
opposite
be
that
he
own

himself
an
instructive
moment
come
in
during
the

in

work
for
you
for
four

callaway
make
a
botch
of
it
as
a
couple
dozen
of
atlanta
s
most
prominent
black
citizen
file
into

he
blurt
come
on
in
boy
a
choice
of
phrase
that
be
met
with
stony
silence
then
he
told
them
i
want
you
to
know
i
m
go
to
treat
you
just
like
i
treat
everybody

it

hardly
an
inspire

davis
s
frustration
with
callaway
grow
as
election
day
near
callaway
be
about
as
cocky
as
anybody
i
ever
saw
davis
report
to
woodruff
bo
feel
like
he
have
the
election
won
go
away
try
as
he
might
davis
could
not
convince
callaway
that
maddox
have
a
prayer
of
defeat
him
it
get
to
the
point
carl
sander
remember
where
mr
woodruff
and
john
sibley
and
some
of
them
finally
just
threw
up
their
hand
in
utter
despair
because
they
couldn
t
get
bo
to
comprehend
hell
he
have
the
race
won
he
should
have
won
it
in
a
walkaway
davis
do
what
he
could
spread
money
here
and
there
plant
a
few
unfriendly
question
for
the
medium
to
ask
maddox
at
forum
and
try
to
keep
mayor
allen
and
maddox
s
other
critic
from
excessive
attack
that
might
backfire
but
his
effort
be
not
enough
when
the
vote
be
count
callaway
fail
to
gain
an
outright
majority
of
the
popular
vote
as
require
by
georgia
law
he
finish
first
but
a
write
in
campaign
for
arnall
held
callaway
below
the
percent
threshold
need
for
victory
the
outcome
of
the
election
would
have
to
be
decide
by
the
georgia
general
assembly
where
the
membership
be
overwhelmingly
democratic
and
almost
certain
to
pick
maddox
the
implication
of
our
world
wide
business
and
maddox
be
of
course
absolutely
incompatible
davis
write
in
a
memo
sum
up
the
think
at
plum
street
the
only
hope
be
to
persuade
the
court
to
order
another
election
in
that
case
davis
note
a
renew
effort
would
be
make
to
secure
the
black
vote
we
have
the
apparatus
to
get
them
out
he
told
woodruff
and
it
have
be
finance
but
the
court
left
the
matter
in
the
hand
of
the
legislature
whose
leader
make
it
clear
they
would
rather
operate
with
maddox
as
a
weak
pliant
governor
than
spend
four
year
wag
battle
with
a
republican
at
length
davis
conclude
that
far
effort
to
block
maddox
would
be
futile
so
far
he
note
the
only
whisper
of
the
company
s
involvement
have
be
a
single
newspaper
report
that
say
progressive
business
interest
in
georgia
be
oppose
to
maddox
well
to
leave
it
that
way
closing
the
book
on
a
disastrous
election
davis
look
ahead
four
year
and
recommend
that
woodruff
buy
worth
of
ticket
to
an
appreciation

for
jimmy
carter
i
do
not
think
this

a

future

there

woodruff
held

never

to

even
in
the
rosiest
of

woodruff
withdrew
far
behind
the

stage
as
happens
to
all
people
who
live
into
their
late
seventy
woodruff
watch
many
of
his

die
or
grow
enfeeble
the
bad
sight
be
bobby
jones
the
great

once
the
master
of
a
golf
stroke
so
fluid
it
seem
a
work
of
art
cripple
by
a
bone
spur
that
dug
into
his
spinal
column
and
left
him
in
constant
pain
paralyze
and
confine
to
a
wheelchair
woodruff
visit
jones
s
house
most
sunday
morning
and
could
see
him
waste
away
more
and
more
woodruff
give
in
to
his
sense
of
futility
as
gresham
call
it
the
dark
mood
that
have
gnawed
at
him
all
his
life
he
take
more
comfort
than
ever
in
liquor
so
much
so
that
his

fear
he
might
stumble

fall
on
the
wind
staircase
in
his
house
on
tuxedo
road
have
an
elevator
instal
to
carry
him
up
to
his
bedroom
at
night
woodruff
s
great
concern
more
worrisome
to
him
than
politics
or
business
be
the
proper
disposition
of
his
fortune
determine
to
make
the
wise
use
of
his
money
he
come
to
detest
pressure
for
donation
from
any
source
no
matter
how
worthy
it
always
give
me
pleasure
to
do
something
for
somebody
without
be
ask
he
explain
once
i
don
t
like
to
be
ask
his
word
be
misinterpret
by
some
as
evidence
of
quiet
beneficence
when
in
fact
he
meant
exactly
what
he
say
he
do
not
like
to
be
ask
million

at
woodruff

request
the

newspaper
agree
to
report
that
a
man
know
only
as
the
anonymous
donor
be
at
work
one
reason
for
woodruff
s
secretiveness
be
a
desire
to
protect
his
brother
george
who
have
three
daughter
and
several
grandchild
and
fear
a
kidnapping
more
than
security
though
woodruff
s
goal
be
to
shield
himself
from
the
distress
of
turn
down
supplicant
every
time

mention
he

swamp
with

of

the

woodruff
as
eccentric
at

possibly
as
evidence
that

have
lose

no
without
linger
over
the

that
it
be
dangerous
policy
to

he
swore
his

a
good
one
his

he
didn
t
plan

convey
a
tone
of
surrender
and
insubordination
at
the

time
there
be
no
dramatic
breach
when
woodruff
reiterate
his

not
a

only
a

from

behind
his

come
as
a
disappointment
to
woodruff
thanks
to
his
personal
wealth
duncan
be
close
to
woodruff
in
way
austin
could
never
hope
to
be
when
woodruff
decide
to
sell
his
ranch
in
wyoming
he
turn
to
duncan
ask
him
to
buy
it
and
name
a
price
duncan
write
a
check
the
next
day
but
that
same
wealth
turn
out
to
be
the
cause
of
duncan

undo
he
be
simply
too
rich
to
put
up
with
austin
s
harassment
duncan
look
to
woodruff
to
protect
him
and
smooth
his
way
and
when
that
do
not
happen
he
resign
he
go
back
home
to
texas
in
the
spring
of
when

should
have
stayed
in

for
his

part
austin
come
to

as
an
obstructionist
a
recalcitrant
old
man
who
demand
flattery
and
hand
hold
and
whose

held
back
progress
with
his

rival
go
austin
gain
a
little
breathing
room
yet
as
he
look
at
his
board
of

he
found
himself
captive
to

all
in

eighty

almost
nothing
about
the

austin
believe
eisenberg
have
go
too
far
on
his
next
birthday
in
march
eisenberg
would
turn
sixty

austin
circulate

propose
not

retire
then

that
the

the

austin
even
nominate
his

for

charles
lord

note
pointedly
that
lord
s
first
act
would
be
to
reverse
eisenberg
s
policy
on
contact
with
wall
street
while
couched
in
dry
language
austin

gambit
be
the
closest

to
an
outright
coup
attempt
at
the

sam
dobbs
have
try

father
more
than
half
a

the
result
this
time
be
no
less
certain
woodruff
kept
eisenberg
in
the
job
and
have
him
continue

savor
them
all
some

he

what
s
in
the
paper
this
morning
jones
recognize
woodruff
s
new
vanity
as
more
than
an
acceptance
of
mortality
or
an
interest
in

in

woodruff
have
be
at
the
center
of
thing
for
half
a
century
jones
thought
and
want
to
stay
there
he
crave
affirmation
of
his
vitality
and
importance
jones
try
to
tease
him
say
he
d
outlive
his
enemy
but
woodruff
s
true
fear
be
outlive
his
usefulness
a
friend
found
him
cry
one
day
fret
that
his

have
lose
its

to
woodruff

age
brought
absolutely
no
benefit
whatsoever
he
hat
be
feeble
hat
grow
deaf
his
eyesight
get
bad
and
he
begin
complain
that
he
be
blind
a
friend
write
to
suggest
book
with
oversize
print
and
he
dictate
a
stark
rejoinder
i
never
cultivate
the
habit
of
reading
book
my
preference
have
be
to
concentrate
on
do
thing
myself
rather
than
read
about
other
people
do
thing
he
become
crotchety
ill
humor
much
of
the
time
joe
jones
who
have
serve
him
loyally
for
four
decade
as
a
male

factotum
gradually
assume
a

large
role
as
chief
of
staff
handle
many
of
woodruff
s
affair
and
occasionally
remind
him
of
the
reality
of
his
advance
year
in
the
winter
of
as
the
city
of
atlanta
languish
in
the
grip
of
recession
one
of
its
business
leader
billy
sterne
the
president
of
trust
company
call
on
woodruff
to
reenter
the
scene
and
give
counsel
again
as
he
have
in
the
hartsfield
and

year
after

s
lone
term
city

have

relation
between
the

community
be
strain
there
s
no
way
for
you
to
reenter
the
scene
jones
told
woodruff
the
city
s
reign
businessmen
be
the
son
and
grandson
of
his
old
friend
and
he
hadn
t
even
met
the
late
batch
of
politician
in
what
way
would
you
become
involve
jones
ask
what
would
be
the
text
of
your
remark
at
say
a
commerce
club
board
meeting
try
to
become
active
again
would
be
a
burden
on
woodruff
jones
say
imply
the
corollary
that
woodruff
be
also
in
danger
of
make
himself
a
burden
on
others
ignore
the
advice
woodruff
agree
to
speak
to
the
director
of
the
commerce

in
the

room
he
d
once

not
long
and
urge
his
listener
to
get
busy
form
a
committee
and
become
involve
the
speech
be
not
an
embarrassment
yet
it
have
little
impact
aside
from
a
white
paper
produce
by
a
local
think
tank
nothing
come
of
it
the
day
of
the
big
mule
have
end
woodruff
make
one
final
graceful
gesture
before
exit
the
political
stage
at
a
time
when
most
businessmen
refuse
to
have
anything
to
with
mayor
jackson
woodruff
go
to
a
meeting
and
make
a
point
of
shake
his
hand
and
pose
with
him
for

i
be
born
too
soon
a
little
over
a
year
later
when
the

compile
a

of
the
ten
most
powerful
people
in

they
left
woodruff
off
explain
that
he
d
take
a
few
step
down
the
ladder
look
back
try
to
pinpoint
the
onset
of
the
terrible
sickness
that
drain
austin
of
his
energy
and
memory
and
that
eventually
claimed
his

some
of
his

remember
the

electric
board
meeting
that
take
place
in

at
the

austin
join

a

with
his
fellow

about
the

for
the
national
economy
over
the
next
few
year
no
one
in
the
room
be
very
optimistic
but
the
austin
scenario
as
he
call
it
stood
out
as
a
grim
vision
of
apocalypse
the
recession
would
continue
and
worsen
austin
say
million
of
american
most

them
black

be
left
unemployed
when
their
unemployment
benefit
ran
out
the

city
would
go
up
in

consume
by

far
bad
than
anything
see
in
the
summer
of
the

fireman
helpless
to
protect
themselves
would
abandon
their

the

all

the

officer
would
seize

take
charles

as
his

he

he

it

be
because
they

with
him
there

other
episode

a

austin
predict
that
half
of
the

would
soon
close
never

uncomfortable
situation
even
more

the
resolution
of
the
bottle
imbroglio
should
have
brought

instead
like
the

noise
that

it
set
off
a

of

that
change

condition
begin
to
worsen
at
an
accelerate
pace
his
judgment
grow
impaired
early
in
he
told
woodruff
he
plan
to
switch
the
date
of
the

woodruff
point
out
that
the

of
the
annual

be
fix
in

and
could
only
be
change
by
a
vote
of
the

do
so
he
say
would
be
unwise
and
unfortunate
then
just
two
year
after
name
his

austin
announce
that

he

woodruff
ask
what

defensively
he
d
be
run
the

he
remind
woodruff
make
adjustment
in
the

hierarchy
there

no
black
friday
just
evolutionary
move
here
and
there
there
be
no
cause
for
alarm
the
press
begin
speculate
about
austin
s
tenure
the
hometown
newspaper
the
atlanta
journal
constitution
report
that
austin
be
silent
about
a
successor
and
leaf
the
impression
that
he
be
in
no
hurry
to
let
an
heir
apparent
emerge
even
though
such
an
attitude
inevitably
have
encourage
a
lot
of
rumor
spread
in
the
business
community
and
a
bit
of
jockeying
for
position
within
the
company
in
fact
austin
do
have
a
successor
in

during
his

in

twenty

earlier
he
d
hire
a
white
south
african

ian
wilson
to
be
his
chief
accountant
and
the
two
men
have
become

friend
in
the
year
since
the
aggressive
sharp

wilson
have
proven
himself
a

up

woodruff

invite
him
to

include
him
in
his

woodruff
give
no
sign
of

to
make

for
those
who

however
it
seem

that
alone
among
the

knew
coca

secret
formula
by

attack
on

along
with
the

goizueta
begin
attend
the

before

woodruff
ask
him
for
a

to

to
the

he

the
good
sense
to
thank

the
old
man
have
give
his
approval
when
he
travel
goizueta
sent
woodruff
postcard
to
those
who
knew
him
goizueta
s
rise
be
not
surprising
he
could
seem
a
little
shy
when
he
first
met
people
ill
at
ease
with
small
talk
quick
to
light
a
cigarette
and
turn
the
conversation
to
a
safe
familiar
topic
yet
he
have
a
keen
observant
eye
and
an
understand
of
human
nature
not
always
found
in
men
of
science
once
he
recall
he
and
austin
be
in
woodruff
s
office
engross
in
a
discussion
about
the
business
when
woodruff
abruptly
interrupt
turn
to
joe
jones
and
bark
joe
how
many
share
of
coca
cola
do
i
have
jones
answer
with
the
exact
number
and
austin
observe
later
that
woodruff
must
be
slip
far
lose
his
memory
and
ability
to
concentrate
goizueta
respond
that
he
thought
it
be
simply
woodruff
s
way
of
remind
both
of
them
he
still
own
a
big
chunk
of
the
company
like
others
in
the
company
with
ambition
goizueta
cultivate
a
close
relationship
with
woodruff
he
told
people
unblushingly
that
woodruff
remind
him
of
his
father
and
he
beam
when
woodruff
begin
call
him
partner
even
though
woodruff
refer
to
most
of
his
junior
associate
that
way
but
goizueta
also
have
genuine
admiration
for
woodruff
an
appreciation
of
the
extraordinary
skill
now
dim
by
age
that
he
d
displayed
run
the
company
for
so
many
year
he
be
a
sponge
goizueta
say
marvel
at
woodruff
s
capacity
to
listen
intelligently
and
draw
information
out
of
others
goizueta
try
to
learn
from
woodruff
he
be
struck
for
instance
by
the
way
woodruff
rarely
set
a
deadline
when
he
give
an
underling
a
project
instead
woodruff
would
ask
the
man
how
soon
he
could
finish
and
most
time
in
his
eagerness
to
please
and
impress
the
bos
the
fellow
would
place
himself
on
the
hook
by
volunteer
to
meet
the
early
possible
completion

austin
predict
would
meet
the
company
s
need
for
at

a
decade
perhaps
longer
in
a
sunnier
frame
of
mind
at
the
time
woodruff
give
his
approval
i
guess
it
look
all
right
he
say
then
he
joked
i
don
t
suppose
john
sibley
and
i
will
have
much
interest
in
what
s
go
on
by
then
anyway
mr
chairman
sibley
shot
back
only
partly
amuse
i
ll
speak
for
myself
on
that
subject
as
it
happen
they
d
both
live
on
into
their
ninety
and
now
the
building
be
near
completion
the
day
approach
when
woodruff
would
have
to
be
move
out
of
his
familiar
beloved
suite
on
the
fourth
floor
of
plum
street
into
new
quarter
suddenly
it
be
no
longer
a
laugh
matter
joe
jones
call
the
architect
and
designer
together
and
explain
carefully
that
they
would
have
to
reproduce
woodruff
s
office
din
room
kitchen
and
conference
room
exactly
in
precise
scale
with
every
last
detail
identical
or
else
the
old
man
would
become
confuse
and
agitate
which
would
mean
serious
trouble
for
everyone
duplicate
woodruff
s
suite
wouldn
t
be
possible
one
of
austin
s
men
say
there
would
be
slight
variation
because
of
the
tower
s
shape
and
the
layout
of
room
would
have
to
be
reverse
in
that
case
jones
reply
he
would
need
an
advance
set
of
blueprint
and
drawing
so
he
could
begin
the
long
difficult
process
of
acclimate
woodruff
to
the
idea
of
innovation
but
the
design
team
let
the
matter
lapse
by
the
time
the
tower
be
ready
for
occupancy
austin
have
place
his
wife
jeane
in
charge
of
decorate
she
get
her
first
hint
of
woodruff
s
simmer
displeasure
one
morning
when
she
call
jones
to
ask
a
question
about
the
furnishing
for
the
new
conference
room
woodruff
jones
warn
have
not
be
inside
the
new
building
have
not
be
show
the
floor
plan
and
want
nothing
more
or
less
than
to
remain
in
the
same
surroundings
he
d
have
for
the
past
quarter
century
on
march
woodruff
be
escort
into
his
new
suite
on
the
penthouse
level
of
the
tower
by
any
standard
of
taste
the
architect
have
create
a
spectacular
space
atop
the
new
building
a
three
story
atrium
with
a
skylight
fine
art
on
the
wall
and
office
overlook
a
panorama
of
atlanta
s
skyline
and
forest
neighborhood
to
woodruff
though
the
light
and
painting
and
pretty
view
meant
nothing
he
prowl
his
room
like
a
detective
comb
the
scene
of
a
crime
the
light
he
grumble
be
too
dim
in
the
office
and
din
room
the
kitchen
be
too
small
and
in
the
wrong
place
the
din
room
be
too
small
the
portrait
light
on
his
favorite
dog
painting
need
to
be
brighter
then
woodruff
go
into
the
bathroom
shut
the
door
and
try
his
new
toilet
it
be
several
inch
low
than
the
old
one
too
close
to
the
floor
for
comfort
it
annoyed
him
tremendously
joe
jones
dutifully
record
all
of
woodruff
s
complaint
and
forward
them
immediately
to
mr
austin
and
her
design
consultant
john
chaloner
they
respond
within
day
by
instal
new
light
but
as
chaloner
explain
with
exquisite
patience
they
couldn
t
very
well
change
the
size
of
the
room
since
those
be
govern
by
the
dimension
of
the
building
as
to
the
toilet
he
say
modern
plumbing
technology
and
federal
health
regulation
require
the
use
of
the
low
model
chaloner
say
he
would
be
happy
to
make
far
inquiry
on
the
subject
and
take
up
the
matter
with
paul
austin
when
he
get
a
chance
but
he
offer
little
hope
of
a
solution
chaloner
s
answer
be
perfectly
reasonable
if
a
bit
patronize
but
it
be
emphatically
not
what
woodruff
wish
to
hear
he
picked
up
the
phone
and
rang
goizueta
who
listen
carefully
and
dispatch
a
carpenter
and
a
plumber
to
woodruff
s
suite
that
very
morning
where
a
riser
be
built
under
the
toilet
lift
it
to
the
exact
precise
identical
height
of
the
old
one
woodruff
be
assuage
the
metaphor
that
by
fix
woodruff
s
throne
goizueta
have
place
himself
one
step
closer
to
inherit
the
company
s
be
too
good
to
miss
austin
meanwhile
be
oblivious
with
his
disease
progress
the
move
to
the
tower
left
him
even
more
disorient
than
woodruff
he
wander
through
the
wrong
door
one
morning
and
demand
of
a
startle
colleague
what
be
you
do
in
my
office
once
an
impressive
speaker
he
begin
stumble
through
his
public
appearance
his
facial
expression
grow
wan
and
uncertain
in
an
episode
that
quickly
make
its
way
through
the
grapevine
he
have
the
company
pilot
fly
him
to
new
orleans
only
to
forget
why
he
d
want
to
go
after
he
land
his
wife
try
to
protect
him
she
begin
spending
her
day
at
the
company
work
out
of
his
office
the
tower
stood
as
the
signature
piece
of
austin
s
regime
almost
literally
the
capstone
of
his
career
a
granite
monolith

the
familiar

script
of

for

with
a
good
eye
for

though

mr
austin

to
make
the
interior
just
as
distinctive

bore
her
touch
she
make
the
tower
into
quite
a
symbol
and
of
course
that
meant
it
be
a
target
too
the
problem
be
the

he
didn

austin

question

about

legal
residency

whether

a
very
strong
feel
that
an

to
take
care
of
his
people
and
he
felt
wilson
be
go
to
create
problem
and
there
would
be
friction
between
people
and
morale
would
go
to
hell
woodruff
summon
austin
to
his
office
and
told
him
wilson
be
unacceptable
have
his
health

austin

when

he
want

the

at
the
two

it
be
easy
to
see
the
study
in

tall
slender

the

while
keough
fail
to
suppress
a
yawn
pronounce
the
whole
thing
an
awful
bore
yet
they
have
no
disagreement
whatsoever
about
what
to
do
with
the

it
wasn

make
enough
money
and
they
agree
it

to
be

other

they
note
ruefully

in

they
have
form
an
alliance
of
necessity
to
appreciate
how
crazy
thing
have
become
goizueta
like
to
say
shake
his
head
one
have
only
to
reflect
on
the
fact
that
austin
assign

so
they
have
team
up
with
nothing
less
in

than
pick
the

apart
and
rebuild
it
from

by

about

authority
in
the

you
re
the

and
goizueta
would
answer
that
he
be
not
that
he

merely
the

the

he
told
woodruff

the
one
who

in
reality
as
woodruff
recognize
goizueta
have
assume

quickly

be
move
to
dismantle
the

the

on

have
to
be
retire
goizueta
felt
not
just
to
avoid

because

it
will
knock

which
be
in

how
goizueta

woodruff
could
no

the

goizueta
that
the

defend
their

word
swept
quickly
through
the

of
the

that
the
product
have
a
taste
problem
in
one
very
important

the

there

a

point
pepsi
could

it

well
than

actual
consumer
could
never
make
a
fair
clinical
determination
of
the
accuracy
of
the
claim
they
couldn
t
decide
for
themselves
because
their
taste

would
always
be
compromise
by
the

and
emotion
and
association
that
the

up

what
they

the
outcome
of
the

reflect
the
eccentricity
of
the
business
pepsi
s
sale
improve
slightly
but
not
at
the
expense
of
coca

some
consumer
swayed
by
the
impression
that
pepsi
have
achieve
parity
with

switch
to

there
be
no
evidence
that

any
significant
last

ultimately
the
campaign

the
effect
of
turn
the

surprisingly

benign

they
loathe
the

it

the

phrase
sugar

a

the

the

they

perfect
a

formula
for
coca

that
would
beat

in

taste
test
like
diet

the
most
noticeable
change
in
the
new
formula
be
its
smoother
taste
brought
about
by
a
reduction

scent
there
be
several
other
change
include
adjustment
in
the

of

aside
from

the

difference
in

of
question
that
could
not

resolve
by

they
begin
by
agree
that
any
change
in

have
to
be
announce
openly
aside
from

the

have
legal
obligation

its

that
require

it
follow
then
that
there
would
be
a
new
coke
and
an
old
coke
and
thus
a
dilemma
whether
to
keep
both
on
the
market
at
first
glance
the
idea
of
two
coca
cola
have
a
logical
appeal
consumer
with
evolve
taste
would
have
a
new
product
tailor
to
their
palate
while
loyalist
could
continue
drinking
what
be
after
all
still
the
most
popular
soft
drink
in
the
land
but
on
closer
reflection
offering
two
coke
threaten
to
defeat
the
very
purpose
of
the
exercise
by
splitting
its
share
of
the
sugar
cola
market
the
coca
cola
company
would
almost
certainly
put
pepsi
in
first
place
with
attendant
bragging
right
as
a
more
elusive
concern
goizueta
and
keough
assume
that
the
new
coke
would
quickly
begin
outsell
the
old
version
lead
to
the
potential
embarrassment
of
have
a
product
call
coke
two
outperform
the
flagship
brand
they
conclude
that
the
old
coke
would
have
to
be
retire
and
take
off
the

explain
the

to
woodruff

receive
his
blessing
for
the

an
account
that
provoke
skepticism
at
the

and
continued
to
raise
eyebrow
many
year
later
actually
goizueta
recall
in
an
interview
for
this

he
have
be
briefing
woodruff
for
several
year
on
coca

s
shrink
market
share
and
poor
performance
in

test
with

i
be
bring
him
along
as
to
what
we
be
do
goizueta
recount
clarify
the
sequence
of
event
and
i
say
you
know
we
ve
try
everything
we
have
the
best
commercial
we
ve
try
everything
and
nothing
work
we
may

um
we
may
have
to
kind
of
change
the

goizueta
s
conversation
with
woodruff
about
the

s
plan
that
be
be
not
quite
as
explicit
as
he
first
suggest
certainly
goizueta
do
not
look
the
old
man
in
the
eye
and
tell
him
point
blank
that
the
sacred
secret
formula
be
be
junked
in
favor
of
a
version
that
taste
more
like
pepsi
there
would
have
be
no
purpose
in

so
he
d
have
hit
me
over
the
head
goizueta
say
besides

permission
wasn

necessary
the

restrict
the

up

the

of

in

that

obviously

of

reiterate
their
argument
for
proceed
look
back
keough
believe
the
key
defect
in
their
preparation
be
a
failure
to
conduct

anticipate
the
public
s
response
to
the
disappearance
of

all
through

that
in

what

the

consumer
think
about
lose
an

there

point
ask
hypothetical
question

i
don
t
think
you
can
do
market

the

whether
she

she
can
t
touch

see
be
just
try
to
measure
emotion
the
one
tangible
inescapable
fact
in
his
view
be
the
twenty
year
slide
in
coca
cola
s
market
share
and
the
urgent
need
to
do
something
about

the

with
exactly
what
to
call
the
product
ike
herbert
s
instinct
share
by
goizueta
and
keough
be
simply
to
retain
the

and
avoid

to
fashion
an
explanation
for

the

after

of
pooh
poohing
the

challenge
no
one
at
the

company
have
the
least
intention
of
admit
that
the
new
taste
be
similar
to
pepsi
s
to
say
so
would
be
tantamount
to
wave
a
white
flag
of
surrender
indeed
even
as
the
work
on
new
coke
near
completion
the
company
ran
television
commercial
with
bill
cosby
exalt
coca
cola
as
less
sweet
than
pepsi
with
more
of
a
real
cola
taste
a
campaign
that
make
absolutely
no
sense
whatsoever
come
as
it
do
on
the
eve
of
the
introduction
of
a
sweeter

at
an
elaborate
press
conference
in

city
on
tuesday

as

script
his
remark
goizueta
intend
to
say
the
new
formula
have
beaten
pepsi
in
blind
taste
test
a
straightforward
claim
of
superiority
he
thought
might
eliminate
the
need
for
any
far
discussion
of
the
reason
for
the
change
but
herbert
and
others
raise
a
warn
if
someone
ask
how
the
old
coke
have
fare
in
taste
test
with
pepsi
goizueta
would
have
to
confess
it
have
lose
the
very
admission
everyone
in
the
company
sought
to
evade
goizueta
cave
in
as
he
put
it
and
agree
to
delete
any
mention
of

or
the
challenge
or
the
relative
merit
of
the

that

a
mistake

put
the
final
touch
in
place
and
prepared
to
announce
an
action
they
could
not

for
which
they
could
provide
no
ready
rationale
the

cola
company
should
have
know
they
be
expose
themselves
to
a
counterattack
from

even
so
they
have
no
way
of
anticipate
just
how
swift
and
sting
the
response
would
be

the

question
set
the

be
you
a
hundred
percent
certain
a

ask
that
this
won
t

the
next
query
simple

direct
expose
the
fragility
of

whole
strategy
what
be
the
difference
a
journalist
ask
between
the
old

and
the
new
coke
when
you
describe
flavor
goizueta
respond
sound
practice
and
thus
evasive
it
be
a
matter
well
left
to
the
poet
or
copywriter
or
member
of
the
press
why
don
t
you
try
it
and
you
yourself
make
the
judgment
the
plan
carefully
craft
beforehand
be
for
goizueta
and
keough
to
avoid
characterize

the
press
they
figure
would
report
pepsi
s
gain
in
market
share
in
recent
year
and
speculate
that
new
coke
be
a
response
but
there
be
no
reason
for
the
company
s
top
two
executive
to
confirm
that
scenario
nor
for
them
to
discus
whether
new
coke
taste
more
like
pepsi
unhappily
for
goizueta
though
the
plan
unraveled
in
a
matter
of
minute
when
another
reporter
persist
in
ask
about
new
coke
s
taste
he
hem
and
haw
and
answer
i
would

that
it
be
smoother

uh
rounder

uh
yet
bolder

of

when
it

over
goizueta

additional

the

a

preference
for

percent
to
percent
thus
goizueta
and
keough
have
reason
to
think
the
idea
of
a
new
formula
would
appeal
to
people
an
argument
they
make
emphatically
during
the
press
conference
but
what
a
reporter
ask
about
the
percent
who
favor
the
old
coca
cola
give
perhaps
the
most
infelicitous
answer
of
the
day
keough
say
smugly
well
percent
of
the
people
vote
for
mcgovern
as
it
happen
keough
and
some
others
in
the
company
s
high
command
thought
they
might
have
to
reissue
old
coke
in
a
year
or
so
perhaps
during
the
company
s
centennial
celebration
in
if
enough
customer
kept
clamor
for
it
but
instead
of
simply
say
so
keough
fuel
the
sense
that
the
company
intend
to
scrap
old
coke
forever
and
that
anyone
who
disagreed
have
no
more
sense
than
a
supporter
of
the
hapless
george
mcgovern
much

somewhere
deep
in
the

of
a

not
at

at

food
restaurant
movie
theater

ballpark
where
the
taste
fluctuate
if
you
go
to
a

outlet
and
you
order
a
coke
he
explain
most
of
the
time
they
put
in
too
much
ice
or
the
carbonation
be
not
as
it
should
be
but
you
have
order
a
coke
and
you
drink
it
and
you
don
t
think
about
it
then
we
change
the
formula
and
you
go
to
that
same
fountain
outlet
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
become
a
wine
taster
a
finicky
critic
ready
to
pounce
have
consumer
compare

goizueta
believe
they
would
have

yet
the
fact
be
many
people
didn
t
want
to
like
new
coke
they
be
unable
to
give
it
a

they

over

their

recognize
they

a
failure
and
urge
the
company
to
apologize
and
bring
back
the
old
product
they
begin
consider
the
idea
don
keough
s
epiphany
oddly
enough
take
place
on
foreign
soil
one
night
in
monaco
during
a
convention
of
coca

bottler
he
and

take
their

to
a

during

hop
to
make
a
friendly
gesture
brought
over
a
basket
with
a
velvet
cover
and
make
a
small
ceremony
of
present
them
a
vintage
ounce
bottle
of
coke
the
original
as
he
proudly
put
it
keough
be
struck
anew
by
the
veneration
accord
the
old
product
and
the
place
of
honor
it
occupy
around
the
world
for
the
first
time
he
begin
to
worry
about
the
permanent
damage
the
company
might
be
do
to
its
goodwill
if
it
continued
to
defy
the
wish
of
its
customer
not
long
afterward
goizueta
recall
he
and
keough
be
chat
in
the
private
din
room
next
to
goizueta
s
office
on
the
twenty
fifth
floor
of
the
coca
cola
tower
in

i
don

know
how
it
come
up
it
could
have
be
him
who
say
it
first
or
it
could

one
of
us
say
why
should
we
be
take
all
this
aggravation
really
that
be
the
extent
of
the
conversation
i
don

just
bring

chuckle
at

he
found
very
little
amuse
in
the

rag
around
him
at
the
time
the

so
much
their

that
the
prime
motive
behind
new
coke
be
to
cut
cost
by
use
cheaper
ingredient
include
synthetic
vanilla
which
lent
credence
to
accusation
that
the
new
product
be
some
sort
of
counterfeit
one
of
the
final
straw
be
a
letter
that
arrive
ask
for
autograph
from
goizueta
and
keough
the
two
dumbest

there
be
a
twist
to
this
story
which
will
please
every
humanist
and
will
probably
have
the
harvard

for
year
the

something
that
caught
us
by
surprise
it
be
a
wonderful
american
mystery
a
lovely
american

you
cannot

it
any
more
than
you
can

love
pride
or
patriotism
some
might
accuse
the

of
