a
day
without

or
hearing
mention
of
capital

their
witty
star
stud
commercial
and
print
ad
be
ubiquitous
though
relatively
new
to
the
banking
and
credit
industry
compare
to
their
historic
competitor
they
have
be
steadily

and
edge
out
the
competition
for
the
past
twenty
five

they

with
some
of
the
most
endure
bank
in
us
history
capital
one
be
not
just
endure
but
historic
and
groundbreaking
as
well
it
s
hard
to
imagine
that
such
a
new
company
could
have
anything
in
common
with
the
legacy
bank
but
in
fact
they
do
a
very
brief
history
of
us
banking
and
lending
some
name
be
synonymous
with

a
resurge
in
popularity
thanks
in
large
part
to
the
smash
hit
hamilton
found
father
aaron
burr
and
alexander
hamilton
be
some
such
name
though
the
two
be
well
know
frenemies
and
help
shape
our
nation
what
be
little
know
however
be
that
the
two
rival
be
also
the
founder
of
two
of
the
large
and
long
endure
us
bank
while
we
tend
to
think
of
big
bank
as
something
unique
to
our
age
they
have
be
part
of
the
fabric
of
american
life
since
its
inception
it
s
all
about
the
hamilton
one
of
the
us
s
old
bank
the
bank
of
new
york
be
found
by
none
other
than
alexander
hamilton
himself
in
upon
his
return
from

access

in
order
to
finance
their
new
business
venture
however
there
be
one
segment
of
the
business
population
hamilton
refuse
to
lend
to
his
enemy
the
jeffersonian
republican
which
essentially
amount
to
half
of
the
merchant
in
new
york
enter
hamilton
s
long
time
rival
aaron
burr
not
to
be
outdone
aaron
burr
who
have
be
outspokenly
anti
federalist
and
anti
credit
in
a
bold
and
some
might
even
argue
devious
move
reword
some
language
in
a
charter
that
have
be
create
to

author
of

hamilton
jefferson
and
the
history
of
what

argues
it
s
the
reason
jefferson

belief

as
he
say
when
the
world
change
often
the
last
people
to
know
be
the
one
most
deeply
involve
in
the
old
way
the
advantage
he
have
as
a
consultant
with
an
outsider
s
perspective
be
what
he
also
credit
to
the
success
of

the
story
of
capital
one
be
the
power
of
an
objective
ignorant
view
of
the
world
from
someone
who
really
didn
t
know
anything
about
the
credit
card
business
fairbank
explains
neither
young
man
have
experience
as
bank
executive
themselves
and
suddenly
they
found
themselves
sit
before
big
bank
exec
and
consult
them
they
have
to
rely
on
ask
probe
question
listen
and
observe
before
jumping
to
conclusion
in
some
way
not
have
work
inside
bank
have
its
advantage
as
well
rather
than
come
from
a
place
of
expertise
or
this
be
how
it
s
always
be
do
fairbank
and
morris
could
look
at
the
issue
bank
be
face
with
a
completely
new
and
outside
perspective
i
think
that
sometimes
when
the
world
be
ripe
for
change
the
less
you
know
the
less
you
have
to
separate
conventional
wisdom
from
real
wisdom
fairbank
add
it
would
also
mean
he
would
have
to
rely
on
data
not
anecdote
to
draw
conclusion
and
make
strategic
suggestion

the
story
of
capital
one
be
the
power
of
an
objective
ignorant
view
of
the
world
from
someone
who
really
didn
t
know
anything
about
the
credit
card
business

the
two
men
spent
a
lot
of
time
together
and
get
to
know
each
other
and
quickly
realize
they
be
both
passionate
about
the
same
thing
they
love
work
together
to
tackle
big
question
and
issue
the
big
bank
in
new
york
be
face
their
primary
job
be
look
at
the
entire
bank
conglomerate
and
figure
out
where
the
big
return
on
investment
be
explain
how
they
do
that
to
the
crowd
of
entrepreneur
before
him
morris
explains
you
bust
a
bank
up
into
its
constituent
part
and
divide
up
the
amount
of
equity
and
you
figure
out
where
the
bank
be
make
a
great
amount
of
money
it
be
there
in
that
data
that
morris
say
the
seed
be
be
plant
in
fairbank
s
mind
for
a
new
way
to
think
about
banking
morris
recall
we
found
time
after
time
there
be
this
business
call
the
credit
card
business
it
be
grow
at
twenty
and
thirty
percent
a
year
and
it
be
make
thirty
to
forty
percent
on
equity
and
candidly
it
wasn
t
be
manage
by
the
superstar
of
the
bank
the
superstar
be
work
on
investment
banking
fairbank
have
several
additional
observation
he
share
in
an
interview
with
stanford
university
business
student
first
the
fact
that
everyone
have
the
same
price
same
apr
and
annual
fee
for
credit
card
in
a
risk
base
business
be
strange
it
be
clear
that
credit
card
would
be
a
very
profitable
business
if
people
actually
paid
you
back
underlie
the
strong
probability
in
the
business
be
a
massively
steep
gradient
of
customer
profitability
and
if
you
could
de
average
that
underlie
profitability
gradient
because
you
could
lose
your
shirt
when
people
don
t
pay
you
back
you
could
build
a
profitable
business
secondly
credit
card
be
a
profoundly
rich
information
business
because
with
the
information
revolution
there
be
a
huge
amount
of
information
that
could
be
acquire
about
the
customer
externally
finally
the
industry
lends
itself
to
massive
scientific
test
because
it
have
million
of
customer
and
a
very
flexible
product
where
the
term
and
nature
of
the
product
can
be
individualize
and
the
channel
of
marketing
be
direct
marketing
where
literally
a
unique
offer
could
be
make
to
every
single
customer
intrigue
by
these
finding
it
be
clear
to
fairbank
what
strategic
direction
bank
should
be
take
he
recruit
morris
to
help
launch
the
ibs
concept
and
find
a
sponsor
fairbank
plan
to
pitch
bank
on
the
concept
of
use
ibs
to
build
a
card
portfolio
tailor
each
product
to
a
market
niche
fairbank
and
morris
then
met
with
twenty
to
twenty
five
head
of
credit
card
division
or
ceo
the
men
pitch
a
combination
of
scientific
test
of
product
and
pricing
feature
and
the
us
of
behavioral
and
actuarial
principle
in
the
data
mining
of
consumer
as
well
as
innovative
idea
regard
credit
score
underwriting
and
collection
fairbank
be
met
with
a
less
than
enthusiastic
reply
from
all
the
bank
he
visit
he
recall
every
issuer
have
the
same
price
for
everybody
that
s
a
ridiculous
notion
it
s
as
if
the
auto
insurance
industry
have
the
same
price
for
year
old
as
they
have
for
forty
six
year
old
sell
the
idea
to
the
bank
be
easy
say
than
do
we
sell
zero
morris
recall
the
time
he
and
fairbank
travel
the
country
talk
to
bank
and
try
to
convince
them
of
this
service
they
would
listen
to
us
and
then
say
it
can
t
be
do
morris
say
the
two
men
grow
accustom
to
hearing
the
oft
spoken
reply
you
re
just
two
business
school
graduate
and
strategy
consultant
what
could
they
possibly
know
about
banking
or
run
a
financial
institution
in
fact
every
single
bank
executive
turn
fairbank
and
his
idea
down
some
more
graciously
than
others
one
ceo
even
threaten
to
throw
fairbank
out
of
the
window
if
he
ever
again
recommend
a
business
with
charge
off
rate
over
one
percent
fairbank
recall
over
half
of
the
bank
cite
the
reason
for
the
decline
be
that
they
be
already
use
ibs
simply
because
they
use
computer
while
other
say
they
couldn
t
possibly
implement
such
a
plan
fairbank
add
some
say
it
would
cause
too
much
internal
difficulty
that
they
would
have
to
realign
the
firm
fairbank
be
quick
to
add
that
this
be
an
entirely
correct
assessment
because
he
explains
create
a
culture
of
constantly
challenge
idea
and
introduce
the
complexity
of
mass
customization
can
mean
profound
change
to
an
organization

morris
say
the
two
men
grow
accustom
to
hearing
the
oft
spoken
reply
you
re
just
two
business
school
graduate
and
strategy
consultant
what
could
they
possibly
know
about
banking
or
run
a
financial
institution

look
at
the
data
the
two
men
weren
t
discourage
though
in
their
mind
this
be
a
fantastic
business
opportunity
morris
remembers
when
they
be
begin
to
tease
out
the
detail
of
a
new
venture
and
knew
that
if
they
be
to
do
something
it
would
have
to
be
do
differently
than
how
bank
be
do
it
then
and
boy
be
there
opportunity
to
do
it
differently
morris
say
the
two
work
through
just
how
they
would
do
thing
differently
and
be
sure
of
their
proposal
they
ask
themselves
what
if
we
give
everybody
the
same
product
at
the
same
price
and
we
start
to
discriminate
base
just
on
underlie
risk
for
example
in
other
word
instead
of
shut
someone
out
because
they
never
have
a
credit
card
before
or
because
their
birthdate
didn
t
match
their
social
security
card
which
be
the
case
for
morris
who
be
not
born
in
the
us
and
that
be
the
case
for
many
immigrant
or
naturalize
citizen
they
could
use
data
instead
we
can
actuarially
prevent
risk
like
they
do
in
car
insurance
for
example
they
could
run
extensive
test
ten
of
thousand
of
test
in
fact
in
an
interview
with
nanette
byrnes
from
bloomberg
fairbank
and
morris
disclose
just
what
those
test
reveal
someone
who
spends
minute
online
research
a
car
purchase
for
instance
be
a
good
credit
risk
for
the
company
s
auto
lending
arm
but
someone
who
call
up
to
apply
for
a
credit
card
be
riskier
than
someone
who
responds
to
a
solicitation
byrnes
acknowledges
in
the
article
that
test
have
be
deride
by
critic
as
gimmicky
but
it
prove
its
value
during
the
recession
as
capital
one
s
bad
loan
and
charge
off
rate
remain
in
check
while
other
lender
saw
them
balloon
the
reason
for
this
accord
to
morris
be
in
the
number
they
could
do
what
others
couldn
t
because
they
be
work
a
large
pool
of
consumer
and
they
be
pay
close
attention
to
what
their
behavior
be
tell
them
at
the
time
the
credit
card
game
in
the
late
eighty
be
one
size
fit
all
one
price
for
everyone
however
only
half
of
american
have
credit
card
and
the
other
half
all
get
the
same
product
morris
add
that
s
where
data
come
in
morris
contends
if
we
could
look
at
the
data
we
could
really
understand
actuarial
risk
in
other
word
could
a
consumer
be
count
on
to
pay
back
what
he
or
she
owe
they
also
want
to
understand
the
unique
need
of
the
consumer
some
want
an
annual
fee
for
a
low
apr
others
want
point
some
people
want
a
picture
of
the
dog
on
the
plastic
card
for
morris
and
fairbank
the
credit
card
industry
be
a
giant
laboratory
in
which
we
could
do
two
thing
unleash
infinite
test
and
learn
capability
to
figure
out
what
product
we
could
offer
to
the
right
person
at
the
right
price
and
do
that
with
actuarial
precision
and
at
the
same
time
use
the
net
present
value
npv
as
the
currency
to
compare
idea
so
you
could
fully
optimize
the
whole
laboratory
for
fairbank
the
vision
be
even
more
simple
the
vision
be
to
smash
the
price
of
credit
he
say
it
be
also
simple
in
another
way
the
data
would
reveal
all
it
would
show
what
the
customer
want
and
need
and
it
would
help
fairbank
and
morris
then
create
product
that
match
those
need
to
morris
and
fairbank
the
idea
seem
like
a
slam
dunk
they
saw
the
data
the
profit
margin
the
untapped
opportunity
all
they
need
to
do
be
sell
the
idea
to
the
big
bank
however
as
all
business
leader
sale
people
and
entrepreneur
know
it
only
take
one
fish
to
bite
after
a
year
of
fly
all
over
the
country
in
signet
bank
in
richmond
virginia
be
game
there
be
only
one
stipulation
signet
want
morris
and
fairbank
to
be
all
in
the
two
men
have
to
leave
the
cushy
consultancy
world
behind
and
begin
work
for
signet
full
time
in
their
richmond
office
fairbank
and
morris
agree
to
accept
the
job
offer
however
they
too
have
a
few
stipulation
they
want
to
have
control
not
only
of
the
credit
card
division
s
strategy
marketing
and
credit
function
but
also
the
information
technology
function
which
reside
in
corporate
fairbank
also
negotiate
a
new
form
of
compensation
he
and
certain
executive
would
receive
significant
share
of
the

of
any
new

generate
signet

and
fairbank

join
signet
in
october
but
what
do
others
say
deal
with
naysayer
when
fairbank
and
morris
go
back
to
their
colleague
at
spa
to
tell
them
about
signet
s
job
offer
they
be
met
with
less
than
enthusiastic
reply
a
senior
partner
at
spa
be
downright
confuse
fairbank
recall
the
man
say
to
him
how
can
you
do
this
you
re
join
cigna
fairbank
have
to
clarify
and
explain
he
wasn
t
leave
the
consult
firm
for
an
insurance
provider
no
no
i
say
signet
fairbank
explain
the
partner
then
wonder
what
s
that
be
you
gonna
run
the
place
and
fairbank
counter
no
no
in
credit
card
i
m
just
go
to
and
the
partner
cut
him
off
and
ask
incredulously
run
the
credit
card
division
no
one
could
see
what
fairbank
and
morris
could
see
mainly
the
opportunity
to
everyone
on
the
outside
it
look
like
a
step
down
for
the
two
men
but
it
just
wasn
t
their
own
colleague
who
be
naysayer
the
men
met
a
different
kind
of
resistance
in
signet
as
well
as
mention
earlier
fairbank
and
morris
have
some
condition
on
which
they
would
accept
the
offer
to
work
for
signet
and
one
of
them
be
that
the
men
have
complete
control
of
the
credit
card
division
s
strategy
marketing
and
information
technology
it
function
signet
couldn
t
understand
the
demand
a
signet
executive
say
to
fairbank
that
s
funny
rich
i
didn
t
know
you

they

work

fairbank

he

fully

be
not

to

they
have
to

nothing

often
warns
against

he

one

on

work
if

you
transfer
in

once

some

may
want
to
think
twice
another
way
customer
can
get
into
trouble
with

be
that
they
enjoy
the

much
and
don

feel
the
incentive

with
the
low
interest
quickly
enough
over

this
can
add
up
still
another
way
borrower
can
get
into
trouble
with
a
balance
transfer
be
if
they
now
have
more
available
credit
on
their
other
card
and
they
don
t
have
enough
self
discipline
to
not
charge
on
that
card
they
could
find
themselves

fairbank
say
i
have
always
believe
that
the
choice
a
company
make
during
the
good
time
will
determine
its
fate
during
the
bad
time
from
our
inception
as
a
company
we
have
chosen
a
conservative
path
with
respect
to
our
business
mix
credit
risk
management
and
balance
sheet
management
to
position
our
company
to
be
as
resilient
as
possible
during
both
good
time
and
bad
we
have
always
operate
on
the
premise
that
the
future
could
be
bad
than
the
past
and
that
a
recession
could
start
tomorrow
rigorously
focus
for
year
on
building
a
company
to
weather
a
severe
downturn
fairbank
essentially
make
a
wager
on
the
other
side
of
the
recession
we
believe
that
there
will
be
a
revaluation
of
bank
and
their
business
model
and
that
the
winner
will
be
disproportionately
reward
he
believe
that
the
conservative
choice
capital
one
have
built
their
business
on
would
ultimately
pay
off
for
their
investor
he
go
on
to
explain
that
this
be
largely
because
the
banking
transformation
and
business
mix
provide
resiliency
as
a
public
company
capital
one
start
as
a
specialty
credit
card
lender
and
rapidly
leveraged
their
growth
and
diversified
into
other
area
of
consumer
banking
while
largely
avoid
less
resilient
business
like
mortgage
during
this
period
however
fairbank
acknowledge
the
specialty
lending
business
model
be
become
an
industry
standard
he
believe
that
this
business
model
s
overreliance
on
capital
market
funding
make
it
potentially
vulnerable
in
good
time
fairbank
conclude
the
capital
market
be
an
efficient
funding
source
but
in
bad
time
we
believe
an
economic
downturn
could
create
funding
challenge
during
an
extend
period
of
capital
market
dislocation
funding
be
like
oxygen
have
it
percent
of
the
time
just
isn
t
good
enough
that
be
why
he
plan
from
the

to
reduce
their
dependence
on
the

market
through
the

of

in
order
to
provide
the
stability
of

to
position
the

for
long
term

first
because

ahead

the

the

of
his

and
his

their

to
their

in

when
he
receive
the
call
from
amazon
in
seattle
the
contract
be
almost
approve
he
be
so
close
he
have
to
seal
this
deal
if
the
contract
fell
through
he
would
lose
his
company
million
of
euro
not
to
mention
the
past
three
year
of
his
life
that
he
dedicate
to
building
a
core
engine
bank
that
sits
on
the
cloud
the
only
thing
stand
in
his
way
be
all
the
party
involve
namely
amazon
web
service
aws
that
host
the
cloud
robeco
zadeh
s
banking
client
who
want
to
use
his
service
and
the
dutch
national
bank
which
make
sure
all
dutch
bank
and
their
vendor
like
ohpen
comply
with
eu
banking
regulation
as
it
do
with
all
bank
the
dutch
national
bank
have
the
right
to
audit
robeco
which
meant
it
could
also
audit
its
vendor
like
ohpen
a
fintech
software
company
that
provide
the
core
engine
banking
software
for
robeco
since
ohpen
use
a
cloud
base
service
aws
to
host
its
software
that
would
mean
that
the
dnb
would
also
need
to
be
able
to
audit
aws
if
zadeh
want
to
finalize
his
contract
with
the
first
bank
ever
to
sit
on
the
cloud
the
dutch
national
bank
have
to
approve
zadeh
s
company
s
use
of
aws
as
a
material
subcontractor
however
this
would
mean
that
aws
would
have
to
change
their
original
contract
language
to
include
the
right
to
audit
this
be
ultimately
opening
pandora
s
box
for
aws
it
would
mean
that
an
outside
entity
could
essentially
audit
or
gain
access
to
information
on
their
cloud
server
this
be
a
highly
complex
intricate
and
sensitive
issue
if
aws
didn
t
allow
this
right
to
audit
then
the
dnb
wouldn
t
approve
robeco
sit
on
the
aws
cloud
but
of
course
aws
s
major
concern
be
that
they
didn
t
want
any
of
its
client
right
be
violate
or
have
pry
eye
on
their
intellectual
property
for
month
zadeh
wrangle
with
several
member
and
lawyer
from
all
party
his
priority
be
to
get
aws
to
change
this
standard
contract
language
to
allow
the
dutch
national
bank
to
do
an
audit
at
the
amazon
server
if
we
couldn
t
get
that
do
there
would
be
no
cloud
banking
because
the
central
bank
in
europe
would
have
stop
it
zadeh
say
this
be
an
enormous
undertaking
zadeh
be
an
unknown
entity
at
the
time
especially
in
the
eye
of
a
giant
powerhouse
like
amazon
nevertheless
he
reach
out
to
the
chief
technology
officer
of
amazon
who
happen
to
be
dutch
werner
vogels
zadeh
knew
what
be
on
the
line
for
amazon
and
told
him
as
much
if
you
want
the
financial
service
market
you
will
have
to
arrange
this
i
know
we
be
a
little
company
in
your
eye
and
if
you
re
amazon
you
be
more
interested
in
get
bank
of
america
on
the
cloud
but
whoever
you
re
go
to
sign
every
regulator
in
the
world
will
want
this
audit
right
if
you
don
t
have
this
audit
right
you
will
not
get
one
financial
regulate
company
throughout
the
night
zadeh
stayed
on
the
phone
while
he
drove
all
the
while
work
through
the
final
stage
of
the

with
his

lydia

have
left
a

party
back
in

jumped
on

in

go
to
sit

more
accurately
the
aws
server
cloud
banking
be
now
a
reality
what
exactly
do
that
mean
though
misunderstood
the
cloud
be
not
that
difficult
to
explain
the
cloud
be
not
a
physical
thing
but
rather
a
virtual
thing
that
relies
on
a
vast
network
of
remote
server
around
the
globe
these
server
be
connect
and
meant
to
operate
as
a
single
system
in
order
to
store
and
manage
data
run
application
or
deliver
content
or
a

most
of
us
use
the

to

netflix

able
to
access

from
any
internet
capable

our

our
laptop
and
ipads
the
information
be
available
anywhere
anytime
just
for
some
perspective
in
most
people
be
just
hearing
about
the
cloud
and
no
one
let
alone
bank
thought
of
processing
and
store
one
s
financial
data
there
up
until
no
bank
have
operate
with
production
data
or
application
in
the
cloud
before
rather
every
single
bank
in
the
world
built
their
own
platform
or
what
be
know
as
a
legacy
system
within
their
own
building
zadeh
argue
this
be
wildly
inefficient
the
bank
purchase
or
built
software
and
then
hire
their
own
developer
application
manager
and
system
engineer
to
build
change
patch
and
maintain
it
they
store
all
their
company
s
information
in
one
location
in
giant
computer
in
their
own
data
center
each
bank
essentially
reinvent
the
wheel
every
time
they
set
up
their
banking
system
the
result
usually
massive
issue
amount
of
time
waste
work
force
require
and
expense
the
process
to
integrate
or
migrate
customer
onto
new
platform
be
costly
and
usually
a
logistical
nightmare
he
believe
cloud
technology
would
reduce
and
minimize
these
expense
fairbank
though
he
didn
t
know
and
have
never
met
zadeh
agree
digitize

in
the

the
big
focus
of
the
hsbc

have
be
to
disentangle
the

require
what
fairbank
call
deep
industry
specialization
but
he

we

at
the

the

be
do
national

continued
to
shape
the
financial

as
well
fairbank
have
predict
for
year
in
his
long
personally
write
annual
report
letter
that
the
early
phase
of
national
consolidation
begin
not
one

at

one

he
far
predict
that

and
business
that
be
now
highly
consolidated
be
essentially
off
limit
to
local
and
regional
player
without
national
scale
this
be
where
he
saw
the
opportunity
traditional
deposit
banking
have
be
slow
to
consolidate
nationally
but
he
knew
that
the
trend
toward
national
scale
be
inexorable
direct
banking
on
a
national
scale
be
in
his
mind
inevitable
we

the
million

digital

on
the

of
their
twenty
fifth
anniversary
as
a
public

fairbank
be
in
a
celebratory
mood
he
have
every
right
to
be
he
be
see
his
vision
become
reality
and
remind
shareholder
of
that
vision
we
be
found
on
the
belief
that
the
banking
industry
would
be
revolutionize
by
information
and
technology
begin
with
credit
card
back
then
credit
card
be
a
one
size
fit
all
business
that
rely
on
judgmental
decision
make
by
underwriter
and
marketer
we
set
out
to
turn
one
size
fit
all
into
mass
customization
deliver
the
right
product
to
the
right
customer
at
the
right
time
and
at
the
right
price
we
believe
that
by
de
average
the
market
we
could
smash
the
price
of
credit
and
also
democratize
it
our
vision
wasn
t
just
about
credit
card
we
thought
that
credit
card
would
be
the
first
banking
product
to
be
transform
because
they
be
direct
market
national
in
scope
and
there
be
great
financial
leverage
in
get
marketing
and
credit
risk
decision
right
we
believe
that
if
we
create
a
company
with
these
capability
we
would
be
position
at
the
forefront
of
the
digital
revolution
that
would
ultimately
sweep
across
all
of
the
banking
industry
our
rally
cry
be
build
a
technology
company
that
do
banking
and
compete
against
bank
that
use
technology
building
the
original
fintech
fairbank
have
every
right
to
assert
as
he
do
that
capital
one
be
the
original
fintech
though
fintech
wasn
t
even
a
term
when
they
get
start
in
the
letter
he
argue
it
wasn
t
always
easy
we
have
more
passion
than
customer
and
more
belief
than
believer
he
reminisce
about
his
early
day
lead
a
startup
face
so
many
of
the
same
obstacle
that
entrepreneur
face
today
recruiting
talent
building
modern
technology
from
scratch
conduct
test
and

result
he
admit
that
while
the
initial
idea
come
quickly
it
take
five
lonely
year
until
he
taste
any
success
at
the
twenty
five
year
point
he
could
finally
proudly
assert
that
capital

indeed
be
one
of
the
nation
s
large
credit

they
be

fifth
large
consumer
bank
and
eighth
large

overall
address
the
economic
crisis
which
he
call
the
great
recession
couple
with
the
digital
revolution
fairbank
point
out
that
entire
industry
disappear
and
new
one
appear
but
as
the
digital
revolution
accelerate
and
some
industry
and
bank
panicked
capital
one
cheer
fairbank
knew
all
along
that
capital
one
be
built
to
capitalize
on
the
change
industry
structure
that
s
who
we
be
fairbank
assert
while
most
industry
be
still
flounder
in
and
reel
from
the
recession
capital
one
be
engage
in
acquisition
they
also
saw
themselves
very
much
the
outsider
to
see
the
future
of
banking
fairbank
write
we
didn
t
look
at
how
banking
work
or
what
other
bank
be
do
we
look
instead
at
how
technology
be
change
our
life
we
revel
in
the
miracle
that
google
could
find
any
information
anywhere
in
the
world
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
we
saw
how
waze
could
instantly
find
the
fast
route
and
immediately
adapt
it
if
traffic
change
and
we
marvel
at
how
netflix
could
somehow
find
a
movie
you
love
even
though
you
have
never
heard
of
it
and
weren
t
look
for
it
in
the
first
place
what
all
the
company
share
with
capital

they

a

as
customer
begin
to
acclimate
and
expect
real
time
and
intelligent
offering
in
every
aspect
of
their
life
they
would
also
expect
banking
to
follow
suit
but
fairbank
say
bank
aren
t
built
to
deliver
real
time
and
intelligent
solution
in
fact
they
be
built
for
just
the
opposite
they
be
built
on
legacy
technology
optimize
for
batch
processing
they
employ
complex
manual
process
that
operate
in
organizational
silo
and
many
have
corporate
culture
that
be
resistant
to
change
he
admit
that
despite
all
their
technological
advance
knowhow
and
talent
even
capital
one
which
two
decade
before
have
be
design
around
technology
and
information
be
not
design
for
a
world
that
be
rapidly
move
to
real
time
and
intelligent
solution
fairbank
could
see
the
puck
be
on
the
move
once
again
he
plan
for
it
in
while
the
economic
crisis
be
turn
a
corner
and
they
be
busy
acquire
they
be
also
rebuild
their
own
bank
from
what
he
call
the
bottom
of
the
tech
stack
up
despite
that
capital
one
have
already
do
that
twenty
year
prior
the
world
have
change
so
much
that
capital
one
and
pretty
much
all
of
corporate
america
he
argue
have
be
strand
with
insufficient
tech
talent
and
antiquate
foundational
technology
data
ecosystem
and
method
of
work
he
far
explain
that
up
until
then
the
usual
method
employ
to
adapt
to
change
in
corporate
america
be
to
work
forward
from
where
you
be
rather
than
backward
from
what
technology
enables
this
he
argue
lead
to
subpar
technology
that
be
simply
digitize
analog
activity
or
building
customer
face
apps
on
top
of
outdated
infrastructure
he
argue
that
most
company
be
simply
bolting
new
technology
capability
onto
legacy
operation
or
try
to
quarantine
their
modern
technology
and
innovation
to
select
pocket
of
the
organization
this
he
knew
wasn
t
go
to
yield
result
and
it
wasn
t
go
to
give
capital
one
a
competitive
advantage
in
the
year
to
come
what
he
need
be
to
rethink
how
banking
work
entirely
and
build
technology
that
do
banking
capital
one
go
all
in
building
the
talent
and
process
for
year
capital
one
have
be
what
they
consider
a
lead
technology
company
that
bank
in
other
word
they
work
primarily
in
software
and
data
instead
of
hire
a
stable
of
financier
capital
one
focus
on
building
a
tech
capable
company
by
percent
of
their
technology
workforce
be
engineer
capital
one
embrace
advanced
technology
strategy
and
modern
data
environment
like
so
many
software
and
fintech
company
capital
one
adopt
agile
management
practice
and
not
just
for
software
delivery
though
common
lingo
inside
software
company
most
be
unfamiliar
with
the
term
agile
management
which
at
its
most
rudimentary
be
a
project
management
style
that
favor
individual
and
interaction
over
process
and
tool
it
focus
more
on
work
software
than
documentation
aka
bureaucracy
customer
collaboration
over
contract
negotiation
and
respond
to
a
change
over
follow
a
strict
plan
it
be
primarily
an
iterative
approach
to
planning
project
process
that
mean
the
project
be
complete
in
small
section
or
iteration
then
each
section
or
iteration
be
review
and
critique
by
the
project
team
which
should
include
representative
of
the
project
s
various
stakeholder
all
of
the
insight
gain
from
the
review
or
critique
process
be
then
use
to
determine
what
the
next
step
should
be
in
the
project
the
primary
benefit
of
work
with
agile
project
management
style
be
the
ability
to
respond
to
issue
in
real
time
and
intelligently
as
they
arise
throughout
the
course
of
the
project
in
capital
one
it
wasn
t
just
the
software
team
adopt
this
approach
they
deployed
it
across
the
board
and
even
legal
and
audit
be
use
a
version
of
this
to
get
work
do
in
addition
to
agile
management
capital
one
adopt
a
devops
culture
also
common
nomenclature
in
the
startup
and
fintech
world
devops
come
the
you
built
it
you
own
it
mindset
but
what
it
really
mean
be
that
it
be
a
set
of
software
development
process
dev
and
information
technology
operation
ops
that
be
combine
to
shorten
and
enhance
the

of

it

to
quickly
deliver

and
update
and
require
that
team
work
collaboratively
from
begin
to
end
though
they
be
by
every
mean
a
large
corporation
they
be
operating
every
bit
like
a
small

which
allow
capital

which

capital

could
monitor

develop
in

and
with
a

server
that
be
infinitely

with

there
be
no

to
the

capital
