question
from
shareholder
and
the
press
at
a
recent
corporate
annual
meeting
larry
sat
stiffly
in
his
chair
straight
back
in
a
blue
dress
shirt
and
brown
slack
his
hand
on
his
knee
one
of
them
hold
a
microphone
as
if
he
didn
t
know
quite
what
to
do
with
it

be
more
relaxed
in
a
brown
t

and

sat
comfortably
with
his
forearm

on
his
leg

over
the
crowd
with
an
air
of
intelligent
and
confident
interest
more
willing
to
address
sensitive
topic
than
one
would
expect
from
such
an
intensely
private
entrepreneur
at
this
meeting
amnesty
international
have
present
two
proposal
demand
that
shareholder
require
the
company
to
set
up
a
human
right
committee
to
examine
its
practice
in
china
with
the
aim
of
limit
censorship
there
management
felt
that
this
be
already
be
do
and
reject
the
proposal
but
in
a
show
of
solidarity
with
those
who
have
concern
about
the
issue
sergey
decide
to
abstain
from
voting
his
share
neither
agree
nor
disagree
with
it
true
it
be
a
largely
empty
gesture
since
the
board
and
management
have
plenty
of
vote
to
reject
it
but
he
want
to
demonstrate
an
acknowledgment
of
the
difficulty
of
the
issue
larry
and
ceo
eric
schmidt
vote
against
the
proposal
i
ask
sergey
why
he
abstain
and
he
explain
that
he
be
sympathetic
to
the
cause
and
agree
with
the
proposal
in
spirit
directionally
the
two
proposal
be
correct
he
say
i
think
there
be
certainly
room
for
us
to
have
a
group
of
independent
people
in
google
who
meet
regularly
to
discus
these
question
he
say
but
he
also
say
he
be
proud
of
google
s
action
in
china
where
he
felt
the
company
s
record
be
well
than
that
of
its
competitor
google
us
new
business
tactic
it
s
just
one
of
many
issue
that
have
focus
the
spotlight
on
google
s
ethical
stance
since
the
company
be
found
in
late
by
these
two
stanford
university
computer
science
graduate
student
google
come
out
of
a
project
that
only
a
computer
scientist
could
love
develop
technology
to
search
through
large
electronic
database
of
publish
research
paper
instead
they
come
upon
a
much
great
solution
a
well
way
to
search
through
the
giant
morass
of
data
that
be
the
internet
and
end
up
turn
their
technology
into
one
of
the
big
most
influential
company
in
technology
today
but
technology
alone
do
not
make
a
successful
company
business
tactic
do
larry
and
sergey
have
create
a
unique
company
with
a
new
kind
of
business
model
employ
tactic
that
fit

continue
to
grow

larry

sergey
arguably
create
an

advertising
monopoly
on
a

with
microsoft

just
two
of
them
set
the

guide

larry

work
together

two
half
of
a

balance
machine
ceo
eric
schmidt
be
responsible
for
grow
revenue
but
the
decision
that
larry
and
sergey
make
be
the
fuel
that
power
that
revenue
growth
everybody
in
the
company
refers
to
them
by
their
first
name
sometimes
as
the
single
unit
larry
and
sergey
but
treat
them
like
emperor
the
final
arbiter
of
all
important
decision
a
young
smart

athletic
kid
whose

escape
the
oppression
of

communist
soviet

and
a
clever
young
geek
from
michigan
with
a
fondness
for
lego
would
seem
a
very
unlikely
pair
to
create
a
business
revolution
ask
by

john
ince
in
what
google
s
big
challenge

sergey
admit
it
be
learn
to
run
a

the
most
difficult
part
have
be
learn
to
deal
with
organizational
challenge
we
have
over
people
now
it
s
a

all
the

and
danger
that
this
brings
that
problem
be
exacerbate
by
the
fact
that
they
operate
with
almost
paranoid
secrecy
and
have
mostly
retreat
from
the
public
spotlight
they
rarely
give

an
almost
mystically
enigmatic
reputation
second
only
to
that
of

however
they

with
something
to
hide
the
intrinsic
mystery
surround
google
and
the
founder
in
particular
be
a
huge
problem
probably
the
big
for
a
company
that
relies
heavily
on
the
trust
of
the
people
who
use

many

wonder
if
google
isn
t
evil
after
all
google
do
not
fit
the
profile
of
other
company
we
might
consider
evil
it
have
not
be
involve
in
any
stock
scandal
none
of
its
executive
have
be
force
to
do
the
perp
walk
in

it

never

its

increasingly
larry

sergey
find
that
their
ideal
their
dedication
to
the

of
any

they
can
get
their

seven
year
ago
google
have
one
lawyer
on
staff
now
it
have
more
than
a
hundred
at
a
shareholder
meeting
a
few
year
ago
one
stock
owner
stood
at
the
microphone
and
ask
what
be
you
be
sue
for
these
day
david
drummond
google
s
head
attorney
respond
how
much
time
do
you
have
the
question
that
seem
to
be
on
most
people
s
mind
these
day
be
whether
google
be
become
an
evil
corporation
certainly
competitor
copyright
holder
and
others
think
so
because
google
be
infringe
on
their
revenue
base
privacy
advocate
think
so
simply
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
google
hold
an
incredible
amount
of
data
about
individual
in
the
end
it
s
tough
for
anyone
to
trust
a
company
so
big
so
powerful
and
in
control
of
so
much
personal
data
about
nearly
everyone
one
accidental
security
breach
result
in
hacker
obtain
personal
data
from
google
s
archive
the
most
likely
scenario
of
breaching
the
public
s
trust
would
be
devastate
to
google
s
reputation
the
question
of
whether
larry
and
sergey
can
be
trust
with
all
that
data
can
never
really
be
answer
in
the
affirmative
but
one
mistake
can
answer
it
in
the
negative
forevermore
larry
and
sergey
be
in
the
position
of
gary
hart
would
be
presidential
candidate
in
the
s
who
brazenly
challenged
reporter
to
find
any
scandal
about
him
the
press
promptly
comply
by
catch
him
in
an
extramarital
affair
thus
end
his
presidential
aspiration
in
the
case
of
don
t
be
evil
google
it
s
the
blogger
who
have
set
out
to
prove
in
any
esoteric
way
they
can
that
google
be
become
evil
as
it
get
big
most
of
the
argument
be
along
the
line
that
money
and
power
corrupt
so
google
be
corrupt
as
google
collect
more
information
about
individual
it
becomes
big
brother
these
concern
may
be
real
but
the
argument
be
overwhelmingly
what
if
scenario
rather
than
actual
example
of
evil
the
late
culprit
be
the
web
browser
that
google
launch
in
after
say
for
year
that
it
be
not
interested
in
that
market
but
larry
and
sergey
change
their
mind
and
people
see
this
as
a
duplicitous
change
clint
boulton
who
writes
the
google
watch
blog
for
eweek
asserts
that
the
simple
fact
that
google
be
enter
microsoft
s
territory
make
it
evil
by
default
it
s
hard
to
be
the
overwhelm
leader
in
search
and
not
be
consider
a
monopolist
which
in
business
be
code
for
evil
he
writes
and
he
add
it
s
impossible
to
be
that
powerhouse
then
launch
a
web
browser
to
serve
as
the
gateway
to
your
web
service
and
not
be
consider
blackly
evil
boulton
argues
in
a
later
blog
that
as
a
company
becomes
big
it
need
more
revenue
to
feed
its
machine
and
as
everybody
know
more
money
equal
corruption
the
situation
be
exacerbate
when
the
online
site
valleywag
actually
read
the
onerous
nondisclosure
agreement
that
come
with
chrome
google

it
state
that

notice
google
quickly
retract
it
replace
the

with
the
explanation
in
order
to
keep
thing
simple
for
our
user
we
try
to
use
the
same
set
of
legal
term
our
universal
term
of
service
for
many
of
our
product
sometimes
as
in
the
case
of

this
mean
that
the

for
a

may
include
term
that
don
t
apply
well
to

but
google
us
a
very
similar
agreement
when
guest
lecturer
give
talk
at
the

a
regular
occurrence
san

everything
he

he
have

it
would

exclude
his
lawyer
told
him
to
make
the
list
huge
and
wouldn
t
mind
if
he
come
as
close
as
possible
to
include
everything
in

he

look
more

it
s

it
have
to
agree
to

the
result
of

one
alternative
be
to
stay
out

which
many
google
critic
insist

a
life
change
event
he
go

his
wife
that
they
have
to
get
out
of
the
country
and
settle
in
america
where
real
opportunity
lay
the
problem
be
that
just
express
a
desire
to
leave
the
soviet
union
put
them
in
danger
of
be
declare
refuseniks
which
would
have
cause
even
more
discrimination
but
the
one
advantage
russian
jew
have
at
that
time
be
that
they
be
among
the
few
who
be
allow
to
emigrate
from
the
soviet
union
katok
also
a
mathematician
suffer
from
the
same
ethnic
advantage
as
brin
have
developed
connection
at
the
university
of
maryland
and
with
their
sponsorship
he
manage
to
emigrate
first
in
and
secure
a
teach
position
at
the
university
he
then
work
to
help
his

they
struggle
for
several
month
but
in
their
application
be
approve
just
in
time
soon
afterward
the
soviet
government
end
all
emigration
leave
almost
all
their
possession
behind
the
brin
family
set
up

in
paris
often
the
first
stop
from

some
family
end
up
as

strand
in
a

for
month
or
year
until
they
manage
to
obtain
a

to
their
new
country
but
katok
and
other

help
mikhail
now
michael
secure
a
visa
and
a
teach
position
at
the
university
of
maryland
both
myself
and
michael
brin
be
fortunate
because
there
be
tremendous
empathy
and
solidarity
from
our
colleague
say
katok
we
be
able
to
avoid
be
refugee
in
the
usual
sense
sergey
didn
t
know
the
extent
of
the
anti
semitism
his
parent
face
until
much
later
in
life
but
it
affected
him
nevertheless
he
have
say
that
even
as
a
child
he
never
felt
at
home
in
russia
although
the
family
be
never
deeply
religious
sergey
have
visit
israel
three
time
the
first
time
as
a
teenager
with
his
family
while
there
in
he
give
a
rare
interview
to
ha
aretz
magazine
and
confirm
that
the
difficulty
his
family
have
experienced
in
russia
certainly
have
a
significant
effect
on
my
life
subsequently
he
note
my
family
have
a
lot
of
challenge
in
the
soviet
union
i
think
that
just
kind
of
give
me
a
different
perspective
in
life
the
brins
have
very
little
when
they
reach
the
united
state
sergey
told
ha
aretz
the
u
s
be
very
good
to
us
it
be
a
great
place
but
we
start
with
nothing
we
be
poor
when
we
first
move
to
the
state
we
rent
a
little
house
and
my
parent
didn
t
have
a
proper
room
to
sleep
in
they
have
to
wall
off
the
kitchen
it
be
a
very
humble
begin
what
role
do
this
play
in
mold
his
character
as
an
entrepreneur
we
learn
to
get
by
sergey
say
i
think
be
scrappy
and
get
by
be
important
the
most
important
thing
be
the
background
of
be
jewish
of
just
have
go
through
hardship
and
be
able
to
survive
and
thrive
i
think
that
s
at
the
core
of
the
jewish
experience
but
he
never
go
through
the
process
of
have
a
bar
mitzvah
at
age
thirteen
at
least
in
the
u
s
bar
mitzvah
be
associate
with
get
lot
of
gift
and
money
and
i
be
never
comfortable
with
that
the
math
prodigy
the
family
do
thrive
although
not
nearly
to
the
extent
sergey
have
michael
brin
be
now
a
mathematics
professor
at
the
university
of
maryland
his
mother
over
sixty
when
the
family
emigrate
taught
russian
for
several
year
at
the

eugenia
become
a

old
when
his

in
maryland
in
the
elder
brin
be
still
a
curmudgeonly
and
short
temper
man
although
say
kenneth
berg
a
fellow
professor
at
the
university
of
maryland
there
be
not
a
ruthless
bone
in
his
body
but
he
be
a
tough
professor
gruff
enough
to
hand
grade
paper
back
with
the
comment
my
sincere
condolence
he
s
also
a
stern
parent
michael
have
always
be
very
demand
and
judgmental
say
katok
sergey
be
certainly
very
bright
but
kind
of
quiet
his
dad
have
exact
standard
and
i
don
t
think
at
an
early
age
he
really
appreciate
the
brilliance
of
his
son
michael
brin
discover
his
son
s
promise
one
day
when
sergey
be
eight
or
nine
year
old
katok
and
other
colleague
from
the
university
be
sit
around
the
brin
house
listen
to
michael
complain
about
how
stupid
his
undergrad
be
he
have
try
give
them
a
graduate
level
math
problem
just
a
little
above
the
capability
of
most
undergrad
he
grumble
yet
not
one
of
the
student
have
have
the
brain
to
solve
it
sergey
who
have
be
quietly
sit
in
the
corner
decide
to
speak
up
and
in
his
squeaky
little
voice
accord
to
katok
offer
a
solution
to
the
problem
at
first
his
father
dismiss
him
katok
then
interject
no
michael
that
s
the
correct
answer
add
katok
in
my
memory
it
be
the
first
time
michael
take
his
son
seriously
sergey
be
also
fascinate
with
computer
at
an
early
age
he
get
his
first
computer

commodore
around
when

a
while
he
frequent
primitive
chat
room
then
call
ircs
or
internet
relay
chat
but
later
recall
that
he
grow
bore
with
them
once
they
become
dominate
by
year
old
boy
try
to
talk

in

where
computer

stayed
up
late
to
battle
each

he
even
write
his
own
mud
game
like
larry
sergey
also
attend
a
montessori
school
until
about
age

and
be
quite
happy
there
but
he
be
bore
with
high
school
and
drop
out
after
three
year
there
be
simply
nothing
left
for
him
to
learn
there
his
father
start
call
him
the
high
school
dropout
instead
however
he
apply
to
the
university
of

and
be
accepted
a
year
earlier
than
the
average
high

he
be
take
senior
level
mathematics
class
after
about
a
year
and
take
several
graduate
level
course
before
he
graduate
he
also
take
summer
job
at
prestigious
research
lab
at
wolfram
research
general
electric
information
service
and
the

and
click
world
wide
web
lead
million
of
people
online
i
thought
it
be
pretty
cool
he
say
in
january
it
be
a
fun
thing
to
play
with
kenneth
berg
from
whom
sergey
take
a
differential
equation
course
at
the
university
of
maryland
knew
he
be
a
very
promising
mathematician
berg
recall
write
on
the
board
a
geometrical
proof
of
a
problem
when
sergey
politely
raise
his
hand
and
explain
from
a
purely
conceptual
level
why
that
proof
could
not
possibly
be
true
berg
look
at
the
board
and
realize
he
have
write
down
the
proof
incorrectly
it
be
really
impressive
berg
say
he
really
understood
how
to
think
mathematically
from
a
very
young
age
even
then
add
berg
sergey
offer
his
opinion
without
arrogance
he
simply
saw
something
wrong
and
felt
the
need
to
correct
it
say
berg
still
no
one
today
would
accuse
sergey
of
any
lack
in
the
ego
department
he
always
have
a
tendency
to
correct
teacher
professor
and
colleague
and
retains
that
habit
today
still
berg
add
he
s
a
super
nice
guy
there
s
a
gentle
spirit
about
him
he
seem
to
be
somebody
who
want
to
use
his
intellect
to
do
good
sergey
graduate
in
with
a
dual
degree
in
math
and
computer
science
and
enter
the
ph
d
program
at
stanford
in
he
have
turn
out
to
be
such
a
brilliant
mathematician
that
his
father
expect
big
thing
from
him
but
business
mogul
be
not
one
of
them
after
google
be
start
michael
brin
told
the
university
of
maryland
student
newspaper
i
expect
him
to
get
his
ph
d
and
become
somebody
maybe
a
professor
dr
larry
brilliant
who
be
now
chief
philanthropy
evangelist
at
google
org
the
company
s
philanthropic
arm
believe
that
both
larry
s
and
sergey
s
family
background
be
what
make
them
idealist
with
a
tendency
to
favor
small
corporation
and
individual
over
the
business
elite
inside
their
mind
what
s
at
the
core
of
larry
and
sergey
and
they
ll
disagree
on
this
so
it
s
not
like
it
s
an
absolute
but
they
come
from
a
very
moral
base
he
say
sergey
be
raise
in
the
soviet
union
and
his
family
go
through
a
hell
of
a
lot
he
doesn
t
ever
want
to
see
that
happen
again
he
approach
thing
not
necessarily
look
at
them
from
the
top
of
the
food
chain
he
s
much
more
sympathetic
to
regular
people
there
s
no
deny
sergey
s
brilliance
in
fact
when
he
join
the
ph
d
program
at
stanford
he
pass
all
his
qualify
exam
in
the
first
couple
of
month
after
arrive
most
student
don
t
pas
all
the
exam
until
their
third
year
that
meant
he
didn
t
actually
have
to
take
any
class
just
write
a
thesis
in
order
to
get
the
degree
which
he
never
do
sergey
didn
t
have
to
take
the
ph
d
program
seriously
say
scott

him
and
later
go
on

them

the

be
release
larry
and
sergey
rent
out
an
entire
theater
and
take
the
google
staff
to
see
it
they
grow
up
in
an
environment
that
encourage
open

and
they
share
their
creation
freely
in
the

them

not
only
use

to

school
he
repeat
the
stunt
when
he
built

at
stanford
however
he
do
not
actually
use

rather
knockoff
of

duplos
because
they
be
cheaper
than
the

sergey
once
explain
this
turn
out
to
be
a
big
mistake
because
the
tolerance
the
deviation
in
the
way
the
part
fit
together
on
the
imitation
duplos
be
much
bad
than
the
tolerance
on
real
duplos
and
as
a
result
our
system
would
crash
from
time
to
time
because
these
thing
would
fall
apart
and
the

even
today
sergey
and
larry
especially
larry
be
still
shy
when
outside
the
circle
of
other
technologist
in
person
they
don
t
generate
that
air
of
superiority
so
common
in
silicon
valley
ceo
they
even
seem
deferential
still
have
succeed
so
effectively
in
school
and
as
entrepreneur
they
developed
the
luxury
of
rarely
deal
with
outsider
a
trait
that
many
people
see
as
arrogant
and
dismissive
which
it
often
be
when
larry
and
sergey
met
at
stanford
and
start
work
together
they
found
they
share
not
only
a
profound
love
of
computer
but
also
a
strong
left
wing
bias
and
a
devil
may

attitude
they
distrust

link
than
a
similar
department
at
rival
university
of
wisconsin
larry
have
his
own
idea
about
link
he
told
garcia
molina
if
this
be
so
important
to
us
why
not
make
it
part
of
the
search
process
larry
s
idea
be
inspire
by
his
scientific
background
it
be
well
know
in
the
scientific
community
that
when
a
researcher
cite
your
paper
in
his
own
it
lends
yours
more
credibility
the
more
citation
you
get
the
more
important
your
paper
be
perceive
by
the
research
community
this
idea
be
codify
in
the
science
citation
index
create
in
by
eugene
garfield
founder
of
the
institute
for
scientific
information
larry
reason
that
web
link
be
analogous
to
scientific
citation
and
those
with
the
most
link
probably
be
the
most
popular
and
would
prove
most
useful
to
searcher
those
be
the
site
that
should
be
list
first
in
the
search
result
he
then
begin
create
his
own
software
for
analyze
link
between
site
this
require
some
tricky
program
not
only
do
the
system
count
link
to
a
particular
site
it
go
a
step
far
by
determine
the
importance
of
the
site
do
the
link
this
be
do
by
counting
the
link
to
the
site
one
link
back
this
increase
the
complexity
of
the
analysis
enormously
in
order
to
calculate
relevance
pagerank
also
have
to
track
the
link
two
step
back
and
correlate
that
data
with
the
key
word
larry
first
call
the
system
backrub
because
of
its
property
of
trace
link
backward
but
he
later
settle
on
the
more
sophisticated
pagerank
a
double
entendre
with
his
surname
sergey
also
fell
into
search
engine
research
by
chance
as
a
math
and
computer
science
major
in
the
doctoral
program
at
stanford
he
be
work
on
a
research
project
within
the
database
group
in
he
and
brian
lent
decide
to
try
their
mind
on
another
computer
science
discipline
call
associative
data
mining
this
be
the
process
of
find
piece
of
information
that
commonly
occur
together
retailer
use
it
to
search
through
their
sale
record
and
determine
whether
different
item
be
frequently
bought
together
by
customer
data
mining
be
however
a
new
field
for
computer
science
it
require
archive
mass
of
web
data
so
sergey
have
to
write
a
crawler
program
software
that
visit
web
site
summarizes
their
content
and
store
the
data
in
a
central
location
accessible
to
graduate
student
and
search
company
other
search
engine
already
have
their
own
crawler
sergey
be
a
terrific
programmer
and
engineer
his
data
mining
work
use
the
internet
involve
parse
through
huge
amount
of
data
he
do
it
on
a
scale
that
others
would
not
have
even
contemplate
say
jeffrey
ullman
sergey
s
adviser
sergey
s
paper
outline
the
google
search
engine
be
itself
cite
in
another
scientific
paper
quality
of
service
and
the
electronic
newspaper
the
etel
solution
sergey
be
also
a
clever
hardware
engineer
he
need
disk
drive
to
store
the
data
he
collect
but
have
very
little
money
so
he
bought
the
cheapest
drive
he
could
find
but
when
he
try
them
out
they
weren
t
fast
enough
instead
of
throw
them
out
he
figure
out
a
way
to
make
them
work
anyway
by
double
the
number
of
terminal
on
the
drive
connection
i
have
never
thought
of
do
that
say
ullman
this
be
engineering
of
the
first
order
their
separate
project
brought
larry
and
sergey
together
in
late
i
be
chat
with
larry
a
lot
recall
sergey
he
and
i
get
along
pretty
well
if
larry
want
to
search
the
web
he
also
need
a
crawler
so
he
recruit
sergey
to
the
digital
library
project
combine
his
search
technology
with
sergey
s
web
crawler
they
make
a
great
combination
sergey
like
math
thing
say
stanford
professor
andreas
paepcke
who
head
the
digital
library
project
larry
just
want
to
build
it
just
kind
of
grow
scott
hassan
another
stanford
grad
student
who
work
with
larry
and
sergey
recall
that
it
be
mainly
larry
s
project
for
larry
it
be
his
primary
thing
sergey
be
just
do
it
because
it
be
interest
to
him
they
generally
work
late
into
the
night
on
index
and
parse
web
page
at
a
fresh
choice
restaurant
in
palo
alto
which
offer
a
student
s
special
buffet
for
five
dollar
they
often
toil
until
a
m
there
will
never
be
another
yahoo
at
stanford
larry
and
sergey
s
search
engine
could
analyze
thirty
to
fifty
page
a
second
two
year
later
that
rise
to
about
a
thousand
a
second
today
it
s
million
it
take
a
lot
of
research
and
program
to
make
it
work
we
developed
a
lot
of
math
to
solve
that
problem
sergey
told
an
interviewer
in
we
convert
the
entire
web
into
a
big
equation
with
several
hundred
million
variable
they
played
around
with
different
name
for
their
search
engine
one
of
them
be
the
what
box
but
then
we
decide
that
sound
like
wet
box
which
sound
like
some
kind
of
porn
site
sergey
recall
look
for
a
big
number
they
intend
to
call
the
crawler
googol
a
word
coin
by
the
nine
year
old
nephew
of
mathematician
edward
kasner
for
the
number
kasner
simply
want
to
name
the
big
number
anyone
have
ever
give
a
name
he
then
also
coin
another
name
the
googolplex
which
be
ten
to
the
power
of
googol
larry
and
sergey
later
adopt
the
name
googleplex
for
their
corporate
campus
nobody
thought
this
would
be
the
basis
of
a
new
company
most
people
thought
that
yahoo
have
already
won
the
search
engine
war
although
yahoo
be
really
a
classification
system
akin
to
the
dewey
decimal
system
without
the
decimal
it
be
a
portal
and
do
not
even
have
its
own
search
engine
licensing
one
from
akamai
instead
the
other
search
company
executive
didn
t
think
that
search
technology
could
or
need
to
be
improve
larry
knew
differently
if
the
internet
be
to
reach
its
potential
it
need
new
invention
to
make
it
easy
to
find
the
right
stuff
without
google
the
internet
might
still
be
in
the
pre
hellenistic
age
nevertheless
lent
say
in
early
we
all
say
there
will
never
be
another
yahoo
just
because
this
be
an
academic
exercise
it
didn
t
mean
larry
wasn
t
ambitious
in
order
to
build
a
system
to
test
their
theory
he
and
sergey
be
repeatedly
borrowing
money
from
other
student
and
faculty
and
borrowing
equipment
that
arrive
at
the
load
dock
at
gate
hall
before
its
owner
could
claim
it
we
have
steal
all
these
computer
from
all
over
the
computer
science
department
recall
sergey
finally
professor
garcia
molina
ask
larry
exactly
how
much
of
the
internet
he
want
to
search
larry
s
response
all
of
it
garcia
molina
manage
to
get
them
some
money
from
the
digital
library
project
so
they
could
buy
more
computer
the
google
search
engine
first
set
up
to
troll
through
stanford
s
own
web
page
be
an
immediate
hit
with
student
and
faculty
and
page
and
brin
become
convince
of
its
commercial
potential
by
late
sergey
recall
in
an
interview
we
have
something
we
thought
be
quite
nice
who
want
a
search
engine
but
they
still
didn
t
think
this
would
be
the
basis
for
a
company
they
plan
to
finish
their
ph
d
s
so
they
try
to
sell
their
technology
to
other
search
engine
fortunately
they
found
no
taker
have
they
succeed
google
would
not
exist
for
one
thing
larry
and
sergey
be
pricing
their
technology
very
high
at
about
million
most
company
turn
them
down
flat
around
for
example
larry
call
louis
monier
one
of
the
creator
of
the
altavista
search
engine
at
digital
equipment
corp
dec
altavista
be
then
consider
the
best
search
engine
in
existence
he
try
to
explain
to
me
who
he
be
and
what
he
be
do
monier
recall
he
sound
interest
he
didn
t
sound
like
a
crackpot
or
anything
i
say
yeah
we
should
meet
but
dec
management
show
no
interest
the
company
be
not
really
interested
in
a
search
business
altavista
have
be
create
mainly
to
demonstrate
how
its
computer
server
be
big
and
beefier
than
other
hardware
say
monier
before
monier
could
talk
to
larry
and
sergey
he
need
permission
from
dec
headquarters
in
massachusetts
but
now
that
google
have
commercial
potential
larry
s
obsession
with
secrecy
emerge
he
insist
that
monier
sign
a
nondisclosure
agreement
first
and
dec
management
wouldn
t
go
for
that
this
go
nowhere
which
be
too
bad
say
monier
find
funding
it
seem
today
that
it
be
always
inevitable
that
larry
and
sergey
would
turn
their
search
engine
into
a
company
but
that
be
not
the
case
larry
have
a
million
idea
say
his
early
partner
craig
silverstein
if
he
didn
t
make
a
company
out
of
this
he
d
be
happy
to
make
it
out
of
something
else
later
if
they
have
found
someone
who
take
their
work
seriously
and
want
to
own
it
and
offer
the
right
price
they
would
have
sell
we
didn
t
find
that
so
we
say
okay
we
ll
do
it
ourselves
in
they

to
bechtolsheim
just
take
the
step
of
ask
bechtolsheim
for
money
be
a
bold
and
brash
move
they
have
no
business
plan
or
formal
pitch
luckily
bechtolsheim
didn
t
need
either
accord
to
sergey
he
simply

oh
we
could
discus
a
number
of
issue
why
don
t
i
just
write
you
a

he
fill

cheriton
already

a

one
stanford

who
loan
larry

sergey
money
when
they
be
student
joked
that
the

he
receive
in
return
would
cover
his
retirement
but
this
initial
funding
could
get
them
only
so
far
so
in
the
spring
of
larry
and
sergey
start
seek
million
in
venture
capital
again
they
be
incredibly
brash
for
the
money
they
be
willing
to
hand
over
less
than
one
fifth
of
the
company
s

thus
value
the
company
at
more
than
million
most
silicon
valley
company
have
a
hard
time
get
that
much
money
and
they
give
away
a
much
large
percentage
of
the
start
up
s
ownership
to
get
it
but
the
fact
that
they
have
already
persuade
bechtolsheim
and
other
prominent
angel
to
invest
impressed
enough
people
to
allow
larry
and
sergey
to
get
the
pick
of
the
litter
they
go
to
the
top
of
the

from

these

most
entrepreneur
feel
lucky
if
they
can
even
get
in
the
door
to
make
a
pitch
but
larry
and
sergey
do
not
want
to
give
too
much
control
of
their
company
to
any
individual
firm
and
insist
that
they
split
the
deal
each
venture

firm
could
invest
million
in

for
percent
of

it
almost
kill

both

the

wasn
t
the
free

computer
scientist

engineer
be
infect
with

the

propagate
by

sergey
sergey
have
emphasize
this
fact
note
that
it
s
especially
important
as
the

retreat
this

where
you

you
be

they

work
here
they
love
to
create
thing
and
they
re
not
here
primarily
for
the
money
he
say
although
when
they
do
create
something
valuable
you
want
to
reward
them
that
s
when
these
thing
really
pay
off
employee
agree
that
the
opportunity
to
make
a
name
for
themselves
even
outweigh
the
perk
and
the
promise
of
rich
from
an
ipo
not
that
everyone
ignore
the
prospect
of
rich
it
s
a
big
draw
for
anyone
join
a
promising
start
up
but
it
wasn
t
everything
accord
to
one
former

i
have
be
at
another
dot
com
and
left
for
google
at
the
first
dot

there
be
an
excitement
but
at
google
it
be
a
whole
different
kind
of
excitement
people
be
really
sure
they
be
on
to
something
at
the
earlier
dot

they
be
think
more
about
how
they
be
go
to
be
rich
at
google
it
be
almost
disdainful
to
talk
about
money
it
be
hot
and
happen
they
all
saw
the
spending
and
instant
rich
but
honestly
it
be
never
a
state
goal
at
google
people
be
too
focus
on
the
technology
no
one
ever
come
run
in
with
a
picture
of
the

they
be
go
to
buy
but
they
do
come
run
in
and
interrupt
meeting
when
we
pass
a
milestone
that
employee
describes
the
work
environment
as
a
velvet
prison

the

it
be
optional
but
there
be
pressure
to
do
it
they
fed
you
all
the
time
so
there
be
no
reason
to
leave
for

a
twenty

and
they

all
such
nice
people
the
stanford

pool
larry

sergey
use
another
technique
to
make
sure
they
would
get
people
who
be
as
close
to
clone
of
themselves
as
possible

other

there

thousand
of

leave
at

you
ask

what

can
you
get

strange
management
larry

show
no
reluctance
to

with
unusual
idea
they
have
create
a

system
virtually

with
very
few

at

poke
at

he

that
we
review
everyone

that
nobody
put

larry
s

session
in
eustace

when
he

with
larry
in
he
talk
about
in
so
many

organize
the

how
important
it

why
it

and
why
search
technology
wasn

finish
we
talk
about
the
kind
of
challenge
that
the
company
face
about
the
company
do
something
that
matter
the
hire
process
be
necessarily
constantly
reevaluate
as
google
grows
we
don
t
really
know
that
the
way
we
hire
at
google
be
optimal
and
we
re
try
to
improve
it
all
the
time
say
page
we
obviously
hire
a
lot
of
smart
people
we
also
hire
people
who
have
different
kind
of
skill
and
we
hire
people
who
work
on
computer
and
do
construction
and
many
many
other
thing
most
important
the
engineer
they
hire
must
have
and
be
able
to
present
a
lot
of
information
about
a
particular
problem
larry
and
sergey
like
to
run
the
company
base
on
data
they
pride
themselves
on
take
a
very
discipline
scientific
approach
to
solve
problem
their
view
be
that
information
be
the
basis
for
almost
all
the
decision
anybody
make
say
eustace
the
more
information
you
can
get
the
more
credible
the
information
be
the
more
likely
you
be
to
make
a
good
decision
to
that
end
google
keep
a
database
of
everything
everyone
be

on

sends
out
regular
e

to
keep
others
in
the

update
employee
primarily
engineer
be
not
only
allow
to
see
what
s
in
the
work
they
re
also
allow
to
critique
the
update
sometimes
not
very
politely
and
suggest
change
it
s
like
a
small
town
with
a
giant
electronic
network
and
too
many
computer
everybody
know
everybody
else
s
business
eustace
also
explains
the
standard
larry
and
sergey
set
the
key
element
we
re
try
to
find
be
smart
people
productive
people
people
with
a
slight
disdain
for
the
impossible
people
who
have
good
leadership
skill
and
who
we
find
interest
we
try
to
avoid
people
that
have
incredibly
large
ego
that
be
inconsistent
with
their
ability
or
be
not
good
at
work
in
team
the
result
of
this
craziness
be
that
sergey
and
larry
have
manage
to
hire
top
people
away
from
start
ups
and
establish
company
alike
include
microsoft
say

they
ve
accumulate
an
amaze
intellectual
capital
for
several
year
when
thing
be
tough
they
d
come
down
and
get
the
absolute
best
people
they
have
the
most
amaze
assortment
of

today
my
old
friend
from
altavista

research
lab
be
there
they
ve
just
totally
drain
the
swamp
in
a
good
way
they
have
a
pool
of
talent
that
be
simply
scary
many
others
in
silicon
valley
see
the
brain
drain
in
less
favorable
term
say
one
venture

google

most
of
google

straight
out

this

the

accept
stock

only
young
people
the
eeoc
aside
it
do
seem
to

still
it
s
certain
that
the
policy
of
hire
young
people
with
strong
academic
cred
have
cause
google

he
didn

after
all
they
didn
t
have
any

also
people
with

break
the

to
adapt

unusual
management
style
too
much
context
for

stifle

you
come
up
with
twenty
seven
reason
why
this

much
as

its

at
stanford

off
slightly
on
the
tuition
subsidy
they
won
t
say
by
how
much
but
they
do
not
change
their
opinion
about
the
need
to
backtrack
on
employee

have
to
grow
up
and
smell
the

the

out
to
be
a
bit
too
rich
for

to
cut
back
on
perk

over
time
a
small
number
of
perk
multiply
by
a
large
number
of
employee
all
of
a
sudden
becomes
a
huge
number
look
at
bottle
water
per
employee
multiply
it
by
twenty
thousand
people
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
re
aghast
we
just
spent
a
million
dollar
in
one
year
on
water
regard
the
daycare
subsidy
he
note
that
the
benefit
go
to
a
relatively
small
number
of
people
but
we
be
pay
more
per
child
than
a
full
time
nanny
would
cost
the
number
just
didn
t
work
out
very
well
it
s
healthy
for
us
to
look
at
each
of
those
thing
i
absolutely
think
they
have
a
right
to
look
at
our
expenditure
this
become
more
critical
when
the
recession
that
hit
the
world
in
hit
google
as
well
for
the
first
time
the
company
start

with
several
thousand
contract
worker
temporary
employee
who
do
not
work
directly
for

but
in
january
acknowledge
that
even
google
have
to
start
watch
the
bottom
line
the
company
announce
that
it
would
slow
its
frenetic
hire
pace
and
be
eliminate
job
for
one
hundred
of
its
recruiter
it
also
close
several
far
flung
office
although
it
s
offering
those
employee
job
elsewhere
at
google
the
idea
that
google
be
become
just
another
company
be
a
bit
of
an
exaggeration
but
as
be
inevitable
for
any
company
that
becomes
as
big
and
powerful
as
google
the
sharp
edge
be
become
worn
as
ideal
bow
to
practicality
with
the
executive
concede
to
some
difficult
choice
the
company
be
become
both
tougher
and
softer
the

very

we
think
this
do
have
a
potential
to
really
change

forever
entrepreneurship
be
a
crime
of
passion
it
require
motive
mean
and
opportunity
the
opportunity
that
be
hand
to
google
be
appreciate
by
nobody
but
its
founder
until
it
be
too
late
to
imitate
the
mean
and
the
motive
be
pure
larry
and
sergey
google
be
one
of
those
company
that
like
apple
and
microsoft
relies
so
heavily
on
the
founder
that
without
them
it
just
wouldn
t
have
the
dynamism
that
make
it
great
theoretically
any
of
a
half
dozen
company
in
business
in
could
have
be
where
google
be
today

the

internet
company
and
the
main
source

although
it
be
not
a

at
the
time
microsoft
have
reach
into
its
very
deep
pocket
to
take
over
the
web
browser
business
and
launch
the

boasting
that
it
be
now
internet
savvy
the
search

ask
jeeves
have
a
multibillion
dollar
valuation
but
in
reality
none
of
them
could
have
be
google
they
didn
t
have
larry
and
sergey
or
their
deep
understand
of
the
internet
their
evangelical
zeal
and
dedication
to
the
search
as
the
savior
of
the
internet
larry
and
sergey
have
instinct
that
point
them
in
the
right
direction
like
an
arrow
fly
toward
dead
center
of
a
target
those
trait
be
what
make
google
so
damnably
successful
they
re
also
frustratingly
stubborn
bold
to
the
point
of
recklessness
and
imbue
with
the
sense
of
the
infallibility
of
youth
they
be
the
right
people
at
the
right
time
online
technologist
at
the
start
of
the
internet
age
but
it
wasn
t
just
larry
s
and
sergey
s
dedication
to
search
that
make
the
difference
they
make
the
right
business
decision
as
well
the
surprising
thing
be
that
they
succeed
despite
their
lack
of
previous
business
experience
before
start
google
the
sum
total
of
that
experience
be
the
semester
larry
spent
work
at
a
bagel
stand
at
the
university
of
michigan
and
yet
in
ten
year
they
manage
to
turn
google
into
a
corporation
with
twenty
thousand
employee
and
billion
in
revenue
that
ratio
of
revenue
per
employee
at
million
each
be
one
of
the
high
in
the
technology
world
microsoft
weighs
in
at
about
per
employee
larry
and
sergey
clearly
do
something
right
that
thing
be
base
on
their
idealism
and
killer
instinct
the
mission
statement
they
include
in
the
prospectus
for
their
public
offering
in
be
to
do
great
thing
for
the
world
they
knew
unlike
most
other
company
that
provide
search
and
portal
service
that
there
be
a
huge
need
for
a
well
way
to
search
that
they
have
it
and
that
it
be
important
this
attitude
have
dominate
their
think
from
the
begin
some
people
argue
with
the
use
of
the
term
idealistic
in
fact
google
s
first
proclaim
mission
statement
do
not
mention
do
great
thing
for
the
world
before
june
the
mission
statement
hastily
put
up
on
the
company
s
web
site
merely
say
to
make
it
easy
to
find
high
quality
information
on
the
web
but
even
that
mission
statement
work
find
high
quality
information
be
something
that
change
the
world
the
key
thing
be
that
larry
and
sergey
be
dedicate
to
the
mission
without
compromise
when
they
file
for
their
first
public
stock
offering
in
sergey
and
larry
include
the
follow
statement
in
a
letter
to
wall
street
search
and
organize
all
the
world
s
information
be
an
unusually
important
task
that
should
be
carry
out
by
a
company
that
be
trustworthy
and
interested
in
the
public
good
say
jim
barnett
the
ceo
of
turn
they
re
really
serious
about
building
great
product
the
way
steve
job
be
i
wouldn
t
use
the
word
idealistic
but
they
re
on
a
mission
and
will
stay
true
to
their
vision
they
re
authentic
and
commit
and
valuesdriven
that
attitude
spread
from
larry
and
sergey
through
the
rest
of
the
company
and
have
not
change
craig
silverstein
google
s
first
employee
describes
it
this
way
i
believe
we
re
enable
the
information
age
to
continue
to
grow
and
continue
to
be
useful
there
be
great
potential
for
good
there
my
guess
be
that
most
people
at
google
would
say
something
similar
to
that
could
the
founder
have
possibly
imagine
google
would
get
as
big
as
it
have
yes
say
silverstein
he
recall
a
conversation
with
larry
as
google
be
just
get
start
i
remember
once
say
something
like
yeah
if
we
get
this
deal
and
some
other
deal
maybe
we
can
be
a
ten
million
dollar
company
larry
say
we
should
be
a
ten
billion
dollar
company
i
thought
he
be
joking
but
now
i
don
t
think
he
be
larry
and
sergey
have
always
thought
big
and
always
have
this
idea
that
they
would
succeed
in
this
business
modesty
be
never
one
of
their
strong
point
just
another
stanford
thing
as
a
couple
of
kid
from
stanford
hire
stanford
alum
larry
and
sergey
be
write
off
by
competitor
as
unimportant
louis
monier
the
cofounder
of
altavista
recall
the
attitude
at
the
time
this
be
just
another
stanford
thing
monier
felt
the
same
way
the
feel
when
i
first
met
larry
and
sergey
be
that
these
kid
be
try
but
the
market
be
saturate
i
don
t
think
anybody
take
the
google
guy
very
seriously
nobody
notice
that
google
s
traffic
be
go
up
nobody
paid
any
attention
until
they
start
to
get
some
real
money
and
early
adopter
start
move
to
google
ironically
for
a
company
that
make
all
its
money
from
advertising
larry
and
sergey
never
follow
the
typical
dot
com
strategy
of
spending
their
vc
money
to
advertise
themselves
into
public
awareness
they
do
put
up
a
few
small
banner
ad
on
site
such
as
washingtonpost
com
in
exchange
for
search
support
they
also
go
to
a
couple
of
trade
show
but
when
they
start
the
company
their
discipline
frugality
meant
avoid
expensive
ad
campaign
we
ve
resist
the
temptation
to
have
big
advertising
campaign
sergey
say
in
i
m
not
sure
it
s
the
right
thing
to
do
i
be
concerned
about
long
term
profitability
so
they
turn
to
the
internet
itself
to
spread
word
of
their
technology
the
key
be
simply
to
get
their
product
in
the
hand
of
early
adopter
influential
people
who
would
recommend
it
to
others
and
make
it
seem
like
the
thing
that
cool
people
want
to
use
in
those
day
larry
and
sergey
met
in
person
with
early
adopter
to
tell
their
story
they
have
huge
enthusiasm
and
great
instinct
about
how
to
get
google
know
they
would
tell
journalist
and
other
influential
writer
online
to
conduct
vanity
search
on
the
writer
name
impress
them
with
the
fact
that
google
would
find
article
for
them
that
they
have
write
appeal
to
reporter
ego
be
a
surefire
hit
they
create
so
much
buzz
that
they
make
google
a
verb
yahoo
have
spent
million
of

clever
television
commercial
ask
do
you
yahoo
but
nobody
ever
say
they
do
as
it
turn
out
this
approach
make
it
unnecessary
for
google
to
advertise
the
company
grow
so
quickly
by
word
of
e
mail
and
online
commentary
that
larry
and
sergey
never
have
to
spend
the
money
an
abundance
of
observer
be
ready
to
offer
opinion
on
why
google
end
up
as
the
most
important
fast
grow
company
on
the
internet
many
of
course
believe
it
be
google
s
technical
superiority
that
give
the
company
an
enormous
head
start
their
idea
of
pagerank
let
the
people
who
publish
on
the
web
vote
on
popular
site
be
an
excellent
idea
say
monier
the
pagerank
idea
be
absolutely
brilliant
it
make
a
huge
difference
but
counting
link
be
something
that
any
search
engine
could
have
do
when
he
create
pagerank
larry
remember
be
inspire
by
altavista
s
ability
to
track
link
the
difference
be
that
larry
and
sergey
recognize
that
importance
while
everyone
else
in
technology
overlook
it
competitor
however
generally
claim
that
page
rank
be
no
big
deal
say
robert
davis
the
former
ceo
of
the
search
engine
lycos
a
lot
of
people
talk
about
their
great
technology
and
frankly
i
think
that
have
little
to
do
with
their
success
pagerank
be
not
that
innovative
lycos
do
the
same
thing
it
be
the
core
of
lycos

technology

who
be

of
the

of
the

engine
inktomi
echo
those
thought
most
of
what
be
write
about
google
be
inaccurate
for
one
that
pagerank
be
what
make
them
successful
it
s
a
lot
of
hogwash
it
s
very
important
to
have
an
invention
and
market
it
but
it
s
just
marketing
this
view
have
some
merit
at
the
very
least
pagerank
wasn
t
the
only
thing
that
put
google
ahead
there
s
always
an
element
of
luck
involve
in
any
successful
start
up
and
larry
and
sergey
have
their
share
for
one
they
walk
into
a
huge
vacuum
in
the
market
and
be
buoyed
by
their
own
hubris
and
single
mind
obsession
they
have
complete
faith
that
search
alone
would
make
a
great
company
at
a
time
when
every
other
company
that
profess
to
do
search
be
give
up
on
it
the
problem
be
that
nobody
have
figure
out
how
to
commercialize
a
search
engine
the
prevail
view
be
that
the
flaw
of
a
search
engine
be
that
it
simply
sent
user
away
from
their
site
and
the
ad
they
hop
visitor
would
click
on
this
start
the
age
of
portal
a
misnomer
that
implies
a
door
to
the
internet
but
be
really
something
of
a
wall
garden
in
which
searcher
would
the
company
hop
linger
before
head
off
to
other
site
all
of
the
portal
include
aol
and
yahoo
focus
instead
on
provide
as
much
content
in
their
portal
as
possible
they
have
no
incentive
to
build
a
well
search
engine
and
have
largely
give
up
on
try
to
improve
the
technology
larry
and
sergey
knew
that
this
be
the
wrong
approach
to
them
find
the
right
information
through
a
search
engine
be
much
more
important
than
have
a
single
portal
try
to
produce
all
the
content
that
meet
user
need
the
other
search
engine
say
sergey
lose
sight
of
that
it
s
why
we
start
google
in
the
first
place
we
want
to
get
you
out
of

six
apart
put
it

the

thing
for

that

how
do

avoid

what
a

should
be
without

some
of
the
thing
they
do

by

preach
for

that
this
be
exactly
how

because
most
people

in
a

of
confuse

they
pine
for
simplicity
even

so

with

that
it
s
hard
to
find
what
you
re
look
for

be
one
of
the
difference
that
make

and

so
popular

an

from
one

late
one
night
in
the
summer
of
she
come
across
an
e

that
consist
of
just
a
number
she
have
no
idea
what
it
meant
so
she
search
through
her
e
mail
to
see
what
other
mail
that
person
have
sent
they
be
all
single
number
and
then
one
that
she
found
very
tell
get
a
bit
heavy
aren
t
we
the
first
e

add
a
comment
what
happen
to
the

arrive
on
the
day
she
launch
change
in
the

the

counting

on
the

and
complain
that
it
be
get
too
clutter
mayer
thought
she
be
do
everything
she
could
to
keep
the
home
page
simple
but
she
have
never
thought
to
count
the
word
that
have
be
her
approach
ever
since
the
current
number
be
larry
and
sergey
now
insist
that
this
be
the
maximum
they
will
allow
in
the
summer
of
mayer
want
to
add
the
word
privacy
as
a
link
to
the
company
s
privacy
policy
but
she
writes
in
her
blog
larry
and
sergey
told
me
we
could
only
add
this
to
the
homepage
if
we
take
a
word
away
keep
the
weight
of
the
homepage
unchanged
at
she
look
at
the
copyright
line
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
decide
to
drop
the
word
google
since
the
owner
of
the
copyright
be
obvious
the
important
thing
be
that
mayer
and
other
senior
employee
know
what
larry
and
sergey
want
and
know
that
the
duo
s
final
decision
on
any
important
issue
be
usually
the
right
one
no
other
search
engine
even
try
the
spare
approach
to
web
design
until
google
show
them
the
way
and
once
sergey
and
larry
found
that
it
work
they
carry
it
through
to
every
search
result
page
something
that
virtually
no
other
web
site
have
found
the
need
to
do
just
try
type
www
yahoo
com
and
www
google
com
into
a
browser
and
compare
the
result
focus
on
the
user
duh
this
simple
idea
be
part
of
another
quirk
larry
and
sergey
have
put
their
user
need
ahead
of
everything
else
it
s
rule
number
one
that
larry
and
sergey
list
under
the
head
our
philosophy
on
the
company
web
site
focus
on
the
user
and
everything
else
will
follow
larry
and
sergey
knew
what
people
on
the
internet
hat
ad
disguise
as
search
result
intrusive
pop
up
ad
messy
and
noisy
web
site
offering
more
of
the
same
would
simply
not
serve
the
interest
of
their
user
it
s
a
clich
to
promise
that
the
customer
always
come
first
any
corporate
executive
you
ask
will
claim
this
philosophy
as
his
company
s
own
but
the
sad
truth
be
that
amazingly
few
follow
it
ask
anyone
who
have
wait
for
a
cable
company
to
get
her
system
run
or
wander
the
aisle
of
a
superstore
look
for
the

hour

for
a
customer
support
staff
that
have
be
cut
back
because
business
be
slow
in
a
bad
economy
most
retail
store
follow
a
different
philosophy
they
study
what
item
people
tend
to
buy
together
from
bread
and
peanut
butter
to
tissue
and
makeup
in
order
to
figure
out
how
to
arrange
these
item
most
effectively
on
the
shelf
but
effectiveness
be
not
measure
by
how
efficiently
customer
can
find
the
item
it
s
measure
in
how
long
it
take
customer
to
wander
the
aisle
in
search
of
what
they
want
under
the
premise
that
the
longer
people
wander
the
store
the
more
likely
they
be
to
find
and
buy
something
they
didn
t
know
they
want
larry
and
sergey
be
dedicate
to
a
simple
idea
make
thing
simple
and
straightforward
seemingly
the
focus
on
user
come
at
the
expense
of
advertiser
larry
and
sergey
insist
that
the
site
sport
a
limited
number
of
ad
and
that
each
must
be
limited
to
a
few
line
of
text
with
no
multimedia
enhancement
that
be
for
the
benefit
of
user
it
s
another
way
to
keep
the
site
simple
and
allow
user
to
focus
on
what
they
come
to
do
find
great
search
result
but
it
turn
out
to
be
great
for
advertiser
as
well
contrary
to
conventional
wisdom
restrict
the
number
of
ad
and
make
them
easy
to
see
make
each
ad
stand
out
more
and
get
people
to
click
on
them
more
often
many
critic
insist
that
most
google
user
can
t
tell
the
difference
between
ad
and
search
result
this
drove
up
the
bid
on
ad
placement
create
an
unexpectedly
rich
revenue
stream
for
google
at
the
time
google
be
launch
the
other
search
engine
make
the
ad
as
intrusive
as
possible
display
as
many
flash
animate
and
obtrusive
feature
as
they
could
cram
in
a
technique
that
most
professional
web
site
still
employ
today
the
ad
be
a
big
part
of
the
reason
many
web
site
today
be
slow
to
load
and
people
be
more
likely
to
shut
off
the
ability
to
play
multimedia
ad
or
graphic
altogether
than
to
click
on
them
monier
asserts
that
this
philosophy
make
a
big
difference
in
google
s
appeal
that
be
absolutely
the
success
he
say
search
be
about
speed
it
s
a
utility
it
s
a
service
something
that
should

all
those
thing
they

do
they

not

approach
that
s
how
they
come
up
with
the
formula
for
advertising

at
first
many
of

whatsoever

the
venture
capital
community

a
small
and
gossipy

have

me
over
the
year
that
google

backer
in
particular
mike

have
fought
with
larry
and

over
these
decision
john

and
mike
moritz
turn
down
request
for
interview
for
this
book
just
like
any
executive
at
a
successful
company
vcs
get
set
in
their
way
and
develop
a
formula
for
how
to
grow
a
company
and
larry
and
sergey
threw
away
the
formula
limit
the
number
of
advertiser
that
be
sure
to
be
a
move
that
would
decrease
revenue
but
since
larry
and
sergey
have
kept
a
control
interest
in
the
company
to
themselves
there
be
little
the
vcs
could
do
about
it
the
venture
capitalist
have
one
card
to
play
to
get
larry
and
sergey
under
control
when
they
fund
google
the
one
concession
they
get
be
that
the
company
would
have
to
hire
a
season
executive
as
ceo
but
the
boy
dither
on
that
promise
for
as
long
as
possible
frustrate
moritz
threaten
to
pull
sequoia
s
funding
if
google
do
not
conform
he
later
admit
to
gq
it
be
not
a
pleasant
conversation
in
the
heat
of

i
rattle

in

ceo
at
novell
and
a
man
cut
largely
from
the
same
cloth
as
larry
and
sergey
schmidt
be
a
light
haired
mild
mannered
extremely
smart
man
with
a
ph
d
in
electrical
engineering
and
computer
science
from
uc
berkeley
he
wear
john
lennon
spectacle
and
look
like
lennon
s
nerdy
opposite
unlike
larry
and
sergey
he
also
have
poise
eloquence
and
a
relaxed
self
deprecate
demeanor
schmidt
first
met
larry
in
at
the
pc
forum
industry
conference
when
they
appear
on
a
panel
discussion
together
larry
present
search
result
to
show
off
google
but
schmidt
be
unimpressed
he
be
very
shy
schmidt
recall
a
nice
enough
person
but
what
i
remember
most
be
think
that
search
engine
be
not
very
interest
and
that
he
be
shy
i
clearly
do
not
understand
anything
at
the
time
of
what
be
go
to
happen
his
first
encounter
with
sergey
be
over
the
phone
sergey
call
him
in
october
of
because
an
employee
they
want
to
hire
wayne
rosing
have
list
schmidt
as
a
reference
the
conversation
start
at
p
m
and
go
on
for
fifty
minute
i
have
never
have
a
reference
check
go
on
for
fifty
minute
schmidt
say
laugh
sergey
be
enormously
interested
in
wayne
but
i
remember
note
that
just
in
general
he
have
this
enormous
curiosity
that
same
month
schmidt
ran
into
google
investor
and
board
member
john
doerr
who
inform
him
that
schmidt
be
on
the
short
list
to
take
over
the
ceo
job
at
google
schmidt
who
be
ceo
of
novell
at
the
time
told
doerr
he
wasn
t
interested
doerr
kept
insist
that
he
meet
with
larry
and
sergey
finally
schmidt
take
sergey
up
on
an
offer
to
visit
them
at
their
office
schmidt
agree
he
say
just
out
of
curiosity
he
go
to
their
headquarters
which
be
at
the
time
ironically
in
an
old
sun
microsystems
building
the
visit
wasn
t
what
he
have
expect
there
be
food
on
a
little
table
and
a
projection
of
schmidt
s
biography
on
the
wall
i
thought
well
that
s
pretty
interest
schmidt
say
it
be
not
the
normal
way
i
have
be
dealt
with
in
my
career
it
be
one
of
those
thing
in
life
you
know
be
just
different
interest
and
different
the
conversation
be
even
more
interest
schmidt
didn
t
know
that
the
meeting
be
a
job
interview
and
it
didn
t
seem
like
one
they
debate
many
issue
in
technology
include
a
project
under
way
at
novell
to
make
a
market
for
storage
service
for
video
which
they
thought
be
pretty
stupid
say
schmidt
they
didn
t
say
that
but
they
basically
argue
against
the
premise
their
argument
be
there
be
a
huge
amount
of
fiber
optic
cable
lie
unused
since
the
dot
com
crash
and
if
someone
start
use
that
cable
on
the
internet
video
could
be
stream
live
thus
eliminate
the
need
for
temporary
storage
i
left
feel
that
something
interest
be
go
to
happen
schmidt
say
at
the
end
of
schmidt
agree
to
merge
novell
with
the
information
technology
company
cambridge
technology
partner
and
decide
to
step
down
as
ceo
which
left
him
free
to
join
google
he
and
larry
and
sergey
negotiate
through
january
larry
and
sergey
seem
strange
they
argue
over
all
sort
of
strange
thing
every
question
be
interest
and
every
question
be
debate
although
he
do
not
understand
google
s
potential
at
the
time
and
insists
he
would
have
be
happy
if
it
have
remain
a
small
company
schmidt
decide
to
accept
the
offer
i
make
the
decision
base
on
their
precociousness
he
say
i
have
this
tremendous
sense
that
i
want
to
stay
because
it
be
just
so
interest
it
be
obvious
that
i
should
join
google
larry
and
sergey
insist
on
spending
a
lot
of
time
with
any
ceo
candidate
which
meant
take
schmidt
skiing
for
a
day
schmidt
thought
this
be
ridiculous
and
agree
to
meet
them
at
the
il
fornaio
restaurant
in
palo
alto
instead
to
test
their
knowledge
he
compile
a
list
of
question
that
a
ceo
should
know
the
answer
to
the
dinner
last
three
hour
they
have
good
answer
for
everything
he
say
just
to
bait
them
he
ask
why
hire
me
you
seem
to
have
everything
under
control
larry
look
at
me
and
say
we
don
t
need
you
now
but
we
will
need
you
in
the
future
which
i
thought
be
the
right
answer
ask
schmidt
how
two
young
men
with
no
business
experience
developed
such
keen
corporate
instinct
and
he
say
i
think
they
be
born
with
it
they
have
remarkably
good
judgment
for
such
young
people
it
s
intelligence
but
also
street
smart
insight
it
s
very
impressive
it
take
me
twenty
year
to
develop
the
insight
they
have
learn
in
two
or
three
schmidt
have
make
a
lot
of
progress
in
turn
google
into
a
more
professional
organization
but
without
lose
the
ideal
that
make
it
unique
in
his
first
year
at
the
company
he
write
a
list
of
standard
and
goal
for
himself
that
closely
match
the
ideal
of
larry
and
sergey
end
user
happiness
be
define
by
the
quality
of
the
search
result
end
user
happiness
over
advertising
be
define
by
the
quality
of
the
ad
he
also
set
the
goal
of
develop
google
s
partnership
program
to
get
others
to
use
its
search
engine
and
create
the
corporate
infrastructure
to
support
a
billion
dollar
company
schmidt
turn
out
to
be
exactly
the
right
person
for
the
job
mainly
because
his
ego
be
sufficiently
in
check
to
allow
larry
and
sergey
to
continue
their
radical
way
few
ceo
recruit
to
a
small
company
would
take
a
backseat
to
the
founder
but
schmidt
do
there
be
plenty
of
ceo
in
silicon
valley
who
will
modestly
assure
you
that
they
re
not
very
smart
but
most
of
them
think
they
re
lie
schmidt
doesn
t
play
the
part
of
a
disarmingly
underrated
executive
he
s
the
role
model
for
the
real
thing
for
the
first
couple
year
he
act
more
like
a
department
head
than
a
ceo
he
saw
no
need
to
interfere
schmidt
like
the
fact
that
larry
and
sergey
take
an
analytical
approach
to
decision
be
proud
of
the
company
s
technology
and
knew
that
it
be
not
possible
to
spend
too
much
on
building
the
technical
infrastructure
to
support
their
ambition
i
didn
t
need
to
overshadow
them
he
say
i
m
a
collaborator
and
i
didn
t
need
the
validation
it
be
their
company
and
i
didn
t
in
any
way
want
to
take
away
from
the
perception
that
it
be
their
company
and
besides
he
do
not
think
of
his
position
as
that
of
the
ultimate
bos
as
major
shareholder
larry
and
sergey
control
the
voting
right
of
the
board
of
director
include
the
ability
to
fire
the
ceo
who
work
for
whom
schmidt
asks
do
larry
and
sergey
work
for
me
or
do
i
work
for
them
on
the
organization
chart
they
work
for
me
but
at
the
time
i
join
they
own
more
than
half
of
the
company
any
ceo
who
walk
into
a
company
where
the
founder
own
half
of
the
company
and
think
those
founder
work
for
him
be
not
pay
attention
to
how
a
board
of
director
work
the
most
important
result
be
that
schmidt
do
not
screw
up
what
larry
and
sergey
have
start
too
many
start
ups
have
be
destroyed
by
ceo
brought
in
as
hire
gun
who
start
conform
to
conventional
wisdom
i
think
eric
be
the
only
guy
who
could
be
ceo
of
that
company
say
anker
they
be
so
overoptimized
for
technology
a
standard
ceo
would
be
reject
eric
can
play
both
side
of
the
coin
the
venture
capital
rumor
mill
also
say
that
google
s
board
be
frustrate
with
schmidt
s
refusal
to
rein
in
sergey
and
larry
but
schmidt
denies
that
this
be
the
case
in
the
end
it
didn
t
matter
the
three
executive
have
learn
to
work
together
smoothly
today
schmidt
have
become
the
public
face
of
google
while
larry
and
sergey
have
retreat
into
the
background
to
run
product
and
innovation
to
decide
where
to
expand
into
new
market
and
when
to
retreat
larry
be
now
president
of
product
while
sergey
be
president
of
technology
role
that
keep
them
heavily
involve
in
google
s
future
as
the
main
arbiter
of
google
s
technology
larry
and
sergey
almost
never
give
interview
or
attend
conference
and
schmidt
rarely
attends
the
friday
technology
review
meeting
head
by
larry
and
sergey
which
be
just
fine
with
schmidt
difficult
partner
schmidt
have
still
not
manage
to
get
sergey
and
larry
entirely
under
control
they
can
be
almost
impossible
to
work
with
especially
when
deal
with
business
partner
they
re
know
for
their
reluctance
to
meet
with
other
executive
show
up
late
for
meeting
and
change
term
that
others
negotiate
as
negotiator
they
be
horrible
to
deal
with
say
an
executive
at
another
company
their
approach
be
to
push
you
to
the
point
where
you
will
walk
away
they
d
hold
you
over
a
barrel
because
they
have
the
power
to
not
everyone
at
google
be
difficult
to
deal
with
most
of
the
people
there
responsible
for
relationship
with
others
have
a
great
reputation
for
be
helpful
and
thorough
ceo
schmidt
be
highly
personable
and
be
involve
along
with
larry
and
sergey
in
important
negotiation
such
as
licensing
the
search
engine
to
others
and
provide
company
with
ad
but
larry
and
sergey
can
be
stubborn
they
know
what
they
want
the
ideal
they
wish
to
stick
to
and
the
value
of
what
they
have
at
google
they
re
impossible
to
deal
with
because
they
re
so
convince
they
be
right
say
a
former
google
executive
it
can
be
frustrate
to
be
sure
some
company
such
as
verizon
wireless
have
a
huge
reluctance
to
deal
with
google
and
be
more
apt
to
sign
deal
with
google
s
competitor
this
could
limit
google
s
future
potential
as
it
becomes
increasingly
dependent
on
partnership
in
order
to
expand
into
new
market
so
the
more
amenable
schmidt
be
take
on
more
and
more
responsibility
for
work
with
third
party
larry
and
sergey
be
good
at
anything
they
choose
to
be
good
at
the
ceo
say
their
role
have
evolve
before
we
go
public
they
be
do
everything
after
go
public
they
retreat
to
work
on
the
product
side
and
the
innovation
side
today
that
ballet
work
it
be
however
a
dance
that
be
still

i
have
never

one
prayer
to

very
short
one
o

make
my
enemy
ridiculous
and
god
grant
it
voltaire
in
june
of
larry
and
sergey
have
a
meeting
with
america
online
aol
have
recently
merge
with

warner
create
what
most
observer
believe
to
be
the
most
important
internet
property
in
the
business
the
aol
executive
want
to
get
to
know
google
well
and
be
consider
licensing
its
search
engine
google
have
already
garner
rave
review
and
in
term
of
user
be
grow
faster
than
a
baseball
player
on
steroid
but
it
have
officially
be
on
the
market
for
only
a
few
month
and
the
aol
deal
be
huge
for
google
it
make
sense
to
link
the
two
company
kpcb
be
an
early
investor
in
both
google
and
aol
although
licensing
their
search
engine
be
the
primary
mean
of
get
revenue
at
the
time
larry
and
sergey
be
reluctant
participant
in
the
talk
sergey
and
larry
be
mad
that
they
have
to
go
to
the
meeting
say
an
employee
who
work
at
google
for
most
of
but
who
like
most
former
employee
refuse
to
let
his
name
be
use
they
only
want
to
talk
to
technology
people
they
be
really
socially
awkward
the
aol
executive
start
talk
about
all
the
potential
opportunity
in
the
two
company
work
together
then
one
of
the
aol
business
guy
in
the
meeting
talk
about
how
google
be
stupidly
refuse
money
by
not
accept
paid
placement
i
e
ad
slip
surreptitiously

the

this
be
one
thing
that
larry
and
sergey
consider
evil
say
the
former
employee
sergey
walk
out
of
the
meeting
and
start
scream
so
that
everyone
in
the
meeting
could
hear
him
someone
get
me
a
can
of
gasoline
i
have
to
light
myself
on
fire
to
get
rid
of
the
scum
of
those
people
so
much
for
get
aol
s
business
at
least
that
time
in
google
return
to
the
negotiate
table
with
aol
to
discus
the
possibility
both
of
aol
use
google
s
search
engine
and
of
google
enhance
aol
s
advertising
system
with
its
own
this
time
schmidt
take
charge
of
negotiation
and
this
time
he
be
the
one
reluctant
to
sign
a
deal
aol
want
a
guarantee
that
google
would
provide
it
with
at
least
million
in
revenue
over
the
length
of
the
contract
at
that
time
google
be
bring
in
only
a
total
of
million
in
revenue
annually
for
itself
be
just
break
even
and
have
net
cash
asset
of
zero
million
in
cash
and
million
in
debt
i
thought
we
would
go
bankrupt
schmidt
say
this
start
the
first
huge
argument
between
the
founder
and
the
ceo
one
he
describes
as
a
significant
marital
spat
larry
and
sergey
be
ready
to
take
the
deal
and
end
up
argue
with
schmidt
every
day
eventually
schmidt
decide
to
schedule
an
argument
every
afternoon
at
p
m
the
schedule
argument
include
larry
and
sergey
sale
executive
omid
kordestani
corporate
counsel
david
drummond
and
eric
schmidt
but
larry
and
sergey
would
not
give
in
finally
schmidt
decide
to
take
his
case
to
the
board
certain
that
the
venture
capitalist
who
have
back
google
would
share
his
reluctance
he
be
wrong
by
that
time
they
have
learn
to
trust
the
seem
recklessness
of
the
founder
i
call
the
board
member
and
they
say
oh
take
the
deal
we
can
always
get
a
loan
against
your
receivables
so
we
sign
the
deal
on
larry
s
and
sergey
s
term
as
it
turn
out
within
six
month
it
be
apparent
that
google
would
have
no
problem
meeting
aol
s
demand
the
relationship
continue
to
this
day
with
that
deal
schmidt
learn
how
influential
and
how
right
larry
and
sergey
could
be
although
that
hasn
t
end
the
occasional
close
door
argument
over
important
issue
say
no
to
advertiser
in
early
though
alienate
aol
seem
like
a
stupid
move
google
s
primary
approach
to
generate
revenue
at
that
time
be
to
license
their
technology
to
others
aol
be
the
big
deal
larry
and
sergey
could
have
make
but
the
two
have
very
specific
idea
about
how
advertising
should
be
do
and
these
do
not
include
give
advertiser
preference
in
search
result
a
practice
know
as
paid
inclusion
since
google
s
inception
larry
and
sergey
have
adamantly
kept
ad
separate
from
search
result
while
others
have
not
they
regard
it
as
deceptive
to
user
something
that
fall
into
the
category
of
evil
it
might
bring
in
revenue
as
user
be
fool
into
click
on
them
think
they
be
pure
search
result
but
larry
and
sergey
be
determine
never
to
pollute
their
search
engine
in
that
way
in
yahoo
announce
that
company
would
have
to
pay
a
fee
if
they
want
to
be
certain
their
site
be
include
in
its
index
of
search
result
in
an
article
in
the
new
york
time
larry
compare
search
result
to
newspaper
article
which
be
suppose
to
be
free
of
influence
from
advertiser
any
time
you
accept
money
to
influence
the
result
even
if
it
be
just
for
inclusion
it
be
probably
a
bad
thing
he
say
google
didn
t
have
to
even
try
the
practice
of
paid
inclusion
revenue
growth
be
fine
without
it
and
as
a
private
company
google
do
not
have
to
succumb
to
investor
demand
that
it
pursue
every
penny
of
ad
revenue
possible
by
contrast
in
all
other
internet
company
be
hurt
like
kick
dog
yahoo
stock
be
down
to
about
a
share
ask
then
call
ask
jeeves
have
see
its
stock
drop
to
cent
at
that
price
someone
could
have
bought
the
company
for
million
shut
it
down
immediately
and
still
make
a
profit
since
ask
have
million
in
the
bank
it
s
easy
to
say
we
should
have
be
do
what
google
do
say
jim
lanzone
a
former
ceo
of
the
search
engine
ask
but
it
be
fundamentally
prohibitive
to
do
that
at
the
time
the
irony
be
that
paid
inclusion
didn
t
even
do
much
to
help
the
bottom
line
the
dirty
secret
be
that
it
s
not
just
bad
for
user
it
do
not
make
you
that
much
more
money
say
lanzone
the
chance
of
someone
click
on
the
sixth
or
eighth
listing
on
a
page
be
so
unpredictable
and
infrequent
it
turn
out
to
be
a
long
walk
for
a
short
beer
it
turn
out
there
s
a
place
for
ad
and
it
s
in
the
ad
section
not
the
search
result
ask
later
drop
the
practice
of
paid
inclusion
and
put
the
ad
only
in
the
separate
box
where
they
belong
yahoo
still
offer
paid
inclusion
the
important
point
be
that
larry
and
sergey
never
consider
the
practice
the
big
shift
this
dedication
to
clean

tend
to
follow
the

path
into

in
fact
many
of
the
idea
that
google
developed
be
simultaneously
be
explore
at
other
company
those
idea
just
never
go
anywhere
their
significance
poorly
understood
at
the
time
when
it
come
to
advertising
larry
and
sergey
get
it
their
advertising
plan
be
developed
or
at
least
consider
before
google
be
even
launch
in
a
january
interview
conduct
by
karsten
lemm
sergey
state
that
they
be
in
the
process
of
prepare
idea
about
how
to
make
money
one
thing
be
we
can
put
up
some
advertising
another
way
would
be
co
branding
provide
the
back
end
search
engine
to
other
site
but
those
idea
do
not
take
the
form
of
an
actual
formal
business
plan
in
fact
there
be
no
business
plan
which
would
normally
lay
out
in
detail
the
propose
revenue
stream
with
projection
on
how
fast
revenue
would
grow
in
five
year
we
work
on
a
business
plan
for
a
little
bit
but
we
be
basically
never
even
ask
for
it
sergey
told
lemm
he
then
add
recently
we
get
an
e
mail
from
one
of
our
investor
say
oh
do
you
guy
have
a
business
plan
i
don
t
think
i
ever
saw
one
although
they
didn
t
yet
have
any
idea
how
the
ad
would
work
they
already
knew
one
thing
the
ad
have
to
be
useful
rather
than
an
annoyance
say
sergey
the
key
there
be
to
put
up
advertising
that
will
be
really
useful
to
our
user
and
not
slow
down
our
site
that
way
we
won
t
push
people
away
from
our
site
but
we
ll
still
take
in
some
revenue
it
take
them
nearly
three
year
to
figure
out
how
to
fill
the
requirement
sergey
have
stipulate
silverstein
say
that
larry
and
sergey
felt
that
no
advertiser
on
the
internet
have
solve
that
problem
it
s
likely
none
of
them
be
try
just
as
larry
and
sergey
demonstrate
that
there
be
a
huge
market
for
a
search
engine
that
give
well
result
they
set
out
to
show
that
there
be
a
market
for
internet
advertising
that
give
well
result
with
the
need
of
the
user
not
the
advertiser
give
the
high
priority
we
have
this
idea
that
if
we
could
get
a
lot
of
user
we
could
make
money
say
silverstein
that
say
we
do
not
have
advertising
for
a
long
time
because
we
couldn
t
think
of
a
way
to
do
it
that
we
thought
be
good
for
our
user
which
i
think
get
to
what
sergey
be
warn
about
there
be
a
lot
of
way
to
do
advertising
it
take
us
quite
a
while
to
find
a
way
that
be
actually
beneficial
to
user
and
have
an
appropriate
separation
between
editorial
and
advertising
we
noodled
it
over
we
talk
about
it
larry
and
sergey
have
maintain
this
attitude
that
advertising
should
be
do
only
when
it
help
the
user
in
some
way
in
engineer
met
with
larry
and
sergey
with
a
simple
proposal
to
include
ad
with
image
search
result
they
argue
that
this
would
add
million
a
year
to
revenue
larry
s
response
be
to
ask
we
re
not
make
enough
money
already
sergey
be
equally
skeptical
i
don
t
see
how
it
enhances
the
experience
of
our
user
he
say
they
reject
the
proposal
invent
adwords
in
most
advertising
at
the
time
include
ad
on
microsoft
s
site
msn
come
in
the
form
of
banner
or
display
advertising
flash

that
appear
at
the
top
of
the

some

already
sell
search
term
to
advertiser
charge
them
for
make
the
ad
appear
when
people
search
use
certain
word
but
most
contract
set
a
predetermine
price
negotiate
by
ad
rep
rather
than
use
an
auction
as
ceo
schmidt
put
it
the
philosophy
be
give
us
half
a
million
dollar
and
we
ll
show
the
ad
whenever
it
s
appropriate
a
company
call
goto
com
later
rename
overture
have
come
up
with
the
idea
of
an
online
yellow
page
system
where
user
would
type
in
search
word
and
be
take
to
advertiser
who
bid
to
have
their
ad
appear
when
people
search
with
those
word
in
after
google
start
show
the
way
microsoft
and
yahoo
both
consider
buying
overture
yahoo
won
the
bid
larry
and
sergey
start
place
ad
next
to
search
result
almost
immediately
in
but
also
sell
them
for
a
set
fee
but
they
be
not
satisfied
with
that
they
have
to
be
sure
the
ad
be
as
relevant
to
their
user
interest
as
be
the
search
result
google
executive
today
insist
that
their
approach
be
unique
and
continue
to
evolve
the
idea
come
out
of
goto
say
google
chief
economist
hal
varian
but
goto
didn
t
really
improve
it
we
take
their
model
and
refine
it
when
the
guy
at
google
look
at
it
they
figure
out
how
to
advance
it
this
strong
emphasis
on
quality
come
from
sergey
and
larry
in
order
to
ensure
that
quality
google
essentially
create
a
separate
search
engine
dedicate
to
determine
the
relevance
of
ad
allow
them
to
select
from
million
of
ad
before
display
them
larry
and
sergey
come
up
with
the
target
ad
model
say
ceo
schmidt
that
model
couple
with
search
be
a
gold
mine
the
focus
in
the
early
day
be
small
advertiser
a
market
that
would
put
google
in
competition
with
ebay
online
and
classify
advertiser
in
newspaper
it
fit
well
with
larry
s
and
sergey
s
desire
to
focus
on
small
player
and
individual
the
two

in
the
idea

to

their

audience
easily
and
get
measurable
roi
return
on
investment
as
more
and
more
user
look
for
local
information
online
we
must
continue
to
improve
our
ability
to
attract
local
advertiser
this
year
we
partner
with
company
to
help
us
bring
more
business
information
online
and
convert
more
small
business
into
happy
google
customer
small
business
be
big
business
because
price
be
to
be
low
sometimes
just
penny
per
click
volume
have
to
be
extremely
high
this
require
a
fully
automate
system
with
very
little
human
intervention
what
they
come
up
with
be
a
system
that
would
let
advertiser
bid
online
to
set
price
with
those
ad
automatically
match
to
search
term
without
advertiser
ever
talk
to
an
ad
rep
get
to
that
vision
of
what
advertising
could
be
be
the
big
bottleneck
say
silverstein
we
could
run
a
system
ourselves
that
could
support
have
a
million
advertisement
from
one
advertising
company
i
e
google
and
just
show
the
right
ad
for
the
right
kind
of
search
after
some
test
it
seem
to
work
so
in
january
larry
and
sergey
give
the
go
ahead
to
convert
google
s
premium
ad
system
in
which
fix
fee
ad
be
place
in
a
box
at
the
top
of
the
search
result
with
the
auction
base
adwords
program
larry
and
sergey
be
solidly
behind
the
switch
but
schmidt
be
worried
that
the
auction
system
would
not
set
ad
price
as
high
as
those
the
google
ad
rep
be
get
i
say
promise
me
that
revenue
won
t
fall
i
be
terrify
as
a
precaution
schmidt
institute
a
period
of
restrict
spending
also
know
within
google
as
the
crap
period
the
rule
be
wickedly
simple
people
could
spend
money
only
one
day
a
week
every
friday
morning
at
a
m
anyone
who
want
to
buy
something
have
to
head
to
schmidt
s
office
to
justify
the
expense
but
this
last
about
three
week
by
then
schmidt
have
discover
that
the
ad
price
through
bid
be
collect
twice
as
much
revenue
as
the
one
that
have
be
sell
by
the
ad
rep
it
turn
out
that
the
rep
be
pricing
the
ad
too
low
for
the
market
one
of
the
beauty
of
google
s
ad
system
be
that
it
automatically
reach
exactly
the
price
the
market
will
bear
it
be
the
support
larry
and
sergey
give
that
make
the
difference
other
company
do
not
have
the
push
from
top
management
to
take
that
leap
in
november
microsoft
bought
a
company
call
linkexchange
which
be
in
the
business
of
distribute
ad
to
other
web
site
along
with
that
acquisition
come
a
man
name
scott
banister
a
young
college
dropout
who
have
come
up
with
the
idea
for
something
he
call
keywords
a
business
he
have
sell
to
linkexchange
his
concept
be
to
create
a
software
system
that
would
auction
off
search
term
to
advertiser
place
the
ad
next
to
the
search
result
in
early
microsoft
s
online
group
ran
an
experimental
system
to
match
search
query
with
ad
but
some
manager
be
worried
that
the
system
would
eat
into
display
ad
revenue
so
those
ad
be
shove
to
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
minimum
bid
be
place
at
fifteen
dollar
per
ad
in
may
the
service
be
shut
down
despite
the
fact
that
banister
s
bos
ali
partovi
pitch
the
concept
to
microsoft
as
the
next
big
thing
executive
at
microsoft
reject
the
idea
they
be
too
tie
to
banner
ad
microsoft
executive
satya
nadella
later
admit
that
shut
off
the
service
be
in
retrospect
a
terrible
decision
but
in
all
honesty
none
of
us
saw
the
paid
search
model
in
all
its
glory
microsoft
wasn
t
the
only
company
to
reject
the
idea
of
socalled
search
advertising
as
a
revenue
model
partovi
frustrate
with
his
lack
of
progress
at
microsoft
start
shopping
the
idea
to
others
yahoo
also
turn
him
down
so
he
try
google
but
larry
and
sergey
have
already
start
pursue
the
idea
on
their
own
the
scientific
approach
ceo
eric
schmidt
have
also
make
significant
contribution
to
the
development
of
google
s
advertising
system
the
big
may
be
in
lure
economist
hal
varian
to
the
company
varian
a
sandy
haired
professorial
type
with
bill
gate
glass
be
dean
of
the
business
school
at
uc
berkeley
in
he
have
write
information
rule
a
strategic
guide
to
the
network
economy
a
book
that
discus
how
to
market
and
distribute
good
in
the
network
economy
include
how
to
price
them
he
have
also
be
involve
with
inktomi
the
search
engine
that
spun
out
of
the
university
when
he
ran
into
his
old
friend
eric
schmidt
at
a
super
bowl
party
in
january
schmidt
who
have
read
varian
s
book
say
why
don
t
you
take
a
look
at
this
ad
auction
varian
recall
i
think
it
might
make
us
a
little
money
varian
wasn
t
sure
he
be
impressed
enough
with
google
to
make
the
leap
from
academia
that
spring
schmidt
and
larry
met
up
with
him
at
a
conference
for
big
thinker
at
the
aspen
institute
varian
wonder
who
the
young
man
be
with
schmidt
i
thought
gee
why
do
eric
bring
this
kid
along
he
could
have
be
in
high
school
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
but
the
two
persuade
him
to
meet
with
some
people
at
google
the
follow
april
and
in
may
varian
take
an
academic
leave
from
berkeley
to
consult
for
google
in
he
become
the
company
s
chief
economist
it
s
a
lot
more
fun
here
than
at
berkeley
he
say
one
of
varian
s
area
of
expertise
be
predictive
pricing
he
work
on
a
system
that
could
predict
the
rate
at
which
people
would
click
on
ad
and
compare
it
to
the
bid
people
place
it
s
part
of
a
discipline
call
economic
mechanism
design
and
it
include
element
of
game
theory
the
system
allows
advertiser
to
decide
how
much
to
bid
base
on
the
number
of
predict
click
on
an
ad
this
be
an
important
feature
since
advertiser
pay
their
bid
price
to
google
only
when
somebody
click
on
their
ad
in
order
to
make
the
system
more
efficient
for
advertiser
they
be
allow
to
see
where
they
stand
in
the
ranking
and
the
bid
make
by
other
advertiser
larry
and
sergey
do
not
scrimp
on
invest
in
the
technology
to
handle
the
ad
placement
system
i
ve
get
to
say
they
thought
big
varian
say
they
built
a
very
large
and
complex
system
it
be
significantly
more
ambitious
than
the
competition
s
and
this
be
at
a
time
when
they
spent
little
money
on
the
normal
accoutrement
of
a
grow
company
most
of
their
money
go
into
the
server
varian
recall
there
be
still
five
people
to
an
office
with
desk
make
from
door
and
steel
leg
that
be
mostly
larry
he
play
his
card
close
to
his
chest
when
larry
and
sergey
start
to
understand
the
potential
of
auction
the
way
growth
be
go
on
they
didn
t
move
into
big
office
the
goal
be
to
fly
beneath
the
radar
as
long
as
possible
people
be
very
surprised
when
number
be
release
about
how
profitable
google
be
larry
s
famous
secrecy
however
be
something
an
academic
researcher
be
not
accustom
to
the
system
varian
first
work
out
in
the
summer
of
be
use
internally
but
be
not
publicize
or
even
write
up
in
academic
paper
but
he
be
invite
to
give
a
talk
at
stanford
and
be
allow
to
say
a
little
about
the
work
since
it
be
a
small
class
a
visit
professor
there
mark
schwartz
have
be
work
on
a
similar
idea
and
talk
to
varian
about
it
it
become
pretty
clear
that
he
be
go
down
the
same
path
varian
say
so
after
his
talk
he
go
back
to
google
and
report
that
other
researcher
be
work
on
the
same
idea
and
ask
if
he
could
publish
a
research
paper
on
the
work
it
go
all
the
way
to
the
top
to
larry
and
sergey
he
say
and
they
finally
give
their
approval
still
other
company
be
slow
to
catch
on
a
couple
of
year
later
varian
present
the
idea
to
a
yahoo
executive
he
say
what
varian
recall
he
have
never
thought
about
it
that
amaze
me
because
we
knew
about
this
in
after
that
yahoo
hire
its
own
chief
economist
as
do
microsoft
the
advertising
system
design
at
google
have
another
clever
quirk
instead
of
just
give
the
high
ad
placement
to
the
high
bidder
google
create
a
feedback
loop
to
give
preference
to
the
most
effective
ad
not
the
priciest
each
ad
build
up
a
reputation
if
people
don
t
click
on
it
it
drop
in
the
ranking
while
lowercost
ad
rise
google
executive
have
say
the
reason
for
this
be
to
ensure
that
the
ad
be
as
relevant
to
the
user
as
possible
but
once
again
it
turn
out
to
be
the
most
profitable
approach
it
s
well
to
get
many
click
on
a
low
pay
ad
than
none
on
a
highpaying
one
it
s
obvious
in
hindsight
keep
the
most
clicked
ad
at
the
top
of
the
page
and
google
collect
more
revenue
competitor
however
question
the
originality
of
google
s
ad
system
from
the
begin
in
after
google
introduce
its
adwords
program
overture
sue
google
for
violate
its
patent
at
the
time
overture
spokesman
william
tell
take
a
few
well
target
shot
at
google
we
ve
spent
million
on
attorney
fee
and
lawyer
fee
he
told
techuser
net
we
re
not
go
to
let
some
company
with
a
bunch
of
hot
shot
programmer
come
in
and
steal
our
best
idea
the
suit
be
settle
in
august
after
yahoo
have
bought
overture
google
be
grant
a
perpetual
license
to
the
patent
in
return
for
payment
in
the
form
of
million
share
of
google
stock
about
percent
of
the
company
at
the
time
create
adsense
in
march
google
launch
a
new
advertising
program
that
would
place
ad
on
other
web
site
rather
than
rely
entirely
on
ad
that
accompany
its
own
search
result
this
be
the
business
that
linkexchange
be
in
when
microsoft
bought
it
in
but
it
do
not
become
part
of
microsoft
s
business
model
google
s
system
use
its
computer
algorithm
to
analyze
the
data
on
a
web
site
and
choose
which
ad
people
visit
that
site
be
most
likely
to
click
on
but
it
turn
out
that
another
company
apply
semantics
in
santa
monica
have
a
very
similar
third
party
advertising
system
call
adsense
its
specialty
be
also
extract
information
from
a
web
site
in
order
to
deliver
more
relevant
ad
a
month
after
it
launch
its
own
unnamed
third
party
advertising
system
google
announce
that
it
have
acquire
apply
semantics
in
a
press
release
about
the
acquisition
sergey
say
this
acquisition
will
enable
google
to
create
new
technology
that
make
online
advertising
more
useful
to
user
publisher
and
advertiser
alike
from
then
on
google
s
system
be
call
adsense
the
final
element
that
make
adsense
popular
be
google
s
decide
to
make
it
more
profitable
for
the
adsense
partner
google
start
splitting
revenue
fifty
fifty
with
site
that
carry
its
ad
instead
of
eighty
twenty
as
be
common
at
the
time
the
reason
for
this
say
one
former
google
executive
it
just
didn
t
seem
right
to
sergey
the
split
today
be
even
more
favorable
and
competitor
have
have
to
follow
google
s
lead
the
result
be
that
adsense
be
also
by
far
the
most
popular
advertising
system
of
its
type
and
it
turn
out
google
can
afford
to
sacrifice
a
high
percentage
of
the
revenue
from
adsense
its
true
value
be
in
the
fact
that
it
creates
a
big
inventory
of
site
show
google
s
ad
this
creates
a
virtuous
cycle
with
more
place
for
ad
to
appear
more
advertiser
want
to
use
google
s
advertising
system
which
make
more
web
site
interested
in
use
google
s
ad
no
other
system
can
match
the
sheer
number
of
eyeball
that
will
look
at
a
particular
ad
and
there
be
little
reason
to
go
elsewhere
competitive
response
after
google
set
the
pace
competitor
try
to
follow
but
they
be
several
lap
behind
microsoft
start
a
project
to
create
a
new
search
engine
and
search
advertising
system
in
code
name
moonshot
its
search
engine
be
launch
in
late
and
the
advertising
system
in
but
by
then
it
be
too
late
advertiser
be
dedicate
to
google
it
be
now
extraordinarily
difficult
for
any
competitor
to
catch
up
to
the
infrastructure
and
design
of
google
s
advertising
system
google
have
too
much
of
a
head
start
and
never
stop
refining
and
advance
its
system
the
system
be
obviously
do
something
right
and
fill
an
unmet
need
google
have
capture
the
overwhelm
share
of
all
advertising
revenue
on
the
internet
and
regulator
and
competitor
be
warn
that
it
have
become
an
internet
advertising
monopoly
both
yahoo
s
and
microsoft
s
ad
system
seem
to
be
race
on
broken
leg
by
comparison
by
the
end
of
google
have
capture
about
percent
of
internet
search
advertising
dollar
while
yahoo
held
on
to
about
percent
and
microsoft
just
percent
google
s
revenue
from
advertising
come
in
at
billion
in
the
third
quarter
of
yahoo
take
in
billion
while
microsoft
s
online
revenue
be
just
million
in
early
microsoft
ceo
steve
ballmer
finally
decide
the
solution
be
to
buy
yahoo
combine
the
two
company
search
and
advertising
market
share
larry
sergey
and
eric
schmidt
didn
t
want
to
see
yahoo
fall
into
the
hand
of
microsoft
a
company
that
despite
its
fumble
in
the
online
world
all
three
executive
be
wary
of
as
a
potentially
fearsome
competitor
the
internet
have
evolve
from
open
standard
have
a
diversity
of
company
and
when
you
start
to
have
company
that
control
the
operating
system
control
the
browser
they
really
tie
up
the
top
web
site
and
can
be
use
to
manipulate
stuff
in
various
way
sergey
have
say
in
a
clear
reference
to
microsoft
i
think
that
s
unnerve
it
take
another
meeting
between
the
top
three
google
executive
to
decide
on
a
proposal
yahoo
didn
t
have
enough
ad
volume
to
fill
all
the
slot
it
have
available
so
google
offer
to
fill
those
slot
with
ad
from
its
own
inventory
with
almost
all
the
revenue
go
to
yahoo
the
google
executive
saw
this
as
a
way
to
save
yahoo
from
microsoft
s
iron
grip
it
seem
like
a
good
idea
at
the
time
but
they
also
knew
that
the
deal
could
cause
some
consternation
among
government
regulator
microsoft
be
prominent
among
the
competitor
complain
that
google
already
have
a
de
facto
monopoly
on
internet
advertising
so
the
google
executive
decide
to
approach
the
u
s
department
of
justice
proactively
in
order
to
explain
why
the
deal
would
not
decrease
competition
and
would
be
a
benefit
to
yahoo
there
be
no
legal
requirement
to
approach
doj
with
the
proposal
the
department
of
justice
normally
take
on
antitrust
case
only
when
there
be
a
complaint
or
when
a
merger
might
reduce
the
number
of
competitor
in
the
market
the
google
executive
felt
that
their
proposal
be
by
far
the
well
option
since
a
purchase
of
yahoo
or
its
search
engine
by
microsoft
would
clearly
reduce
the
number
of
independent
search
engine
by
one
google
s
deal
would
be
limited
in
scope
nonexclusive
and
temporary
they
be
surprised
by
the
response
microsoft
lobby
heavily
against
the
deal
as
anticompetitive
newspaper
advertiser
complain
that
it
would
raise
the
price
of
ad
at
yahoo
since
google
s
ad
tend
to
get
high
bid
than
yahoo
s
critic
argue
that
if
google
s
advertising
system
displace
yahoo
s
there
would
be
less
competition
force
more
advertiser
to
just
go
with
adwords
and
adsense
thus
drive
up
bid
even
high
the
department
of
justice
cast
a
skeptical
eye
on
the
deal
the
google
executive
still
don
t
understand
the
complaint
craig
silverstein
express
this
view
that
argument
make
no
sense
to
me
at
all
he
say
i
don
t
want
to
say
anything
bad
about
those
people
but
i
wonder
how
they
justify
it
silverstein
point
out
that
an
auction
system
be
the
most
direct
way
to
match
supply
and
demand
have
more
auction
system
do
not
increase
the
supply
of
ad
or
of
place
to
put
them
it
just
increase
the
number
of
auction
system
it
shouldn
t
affect
the
price
of
ad
at
all
this
be
very
basic
economics
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
but
google
s
argument
fell
on
ear
that
be
primarily
listen
to
other
voice
and
microsoft
spoke
with
a
very
loud
and
influential
voice
it
have
already
spent
a
decade
learn
how
to
lobby
washington
while

itself
against

some
strange
bedfellow

the
national
association
of
farmer
elect
committee
and
the

since

use

they
be
worried
about
a
google
yahoo

the
time
confirm
that
the

take
a
stance
after

inexperience
and
hubris
make
them
ineffective
larry
and

have
a
tendency
to
believe
that
since
they
re
clearly
in
the
right
the
merit
of
the

would
speak

at
the

google

in
a

position
with
the
overwhelm

of
online

and
online

it
have
seemingly
become

during

you
be

advertising
as
a
whole
be

broader
and
internet

be
much
broader
but
google
want
more
federal

be
now
keep
an
eye
on
the

as
it
diversifies

the

be
now
diversify
the
company
into
print
radio
television

the
obvious
question
be
whether
google
can
leverage
its
online
technology
into
something
that
make
sense
in
other
medium

there
s
already
a
lot
of
experimentation
go
on
under
sergey
s
purview
as
president
of
technology
the
most
promising
new
advertising
medium
for
google
may
be
television
an
area
that
get
particular
enthusiasm
from

in
he
say
the
remarkable
thing
about
television
be
it
s
surprising
but
in
fact
among
offline
advertising
it
s
the
one
that
s
closest
to
internet
level
accountability
and
we
feel
we
can
bring
much
great
roi
type
accountability
to
television
advertising
much
as
we
ve
do

will
probably
be
next
week
here
s
my
advice
don
t
the
hyperbole
reach
fantastic
proportion
the
san
francisco
chronicle
refuse
to
give
in
even
after
the
ipo
as
the
stock
begin
its
astound
three
year
ascent
by
compare
it
to
the
overhyped
once
high
fly
stock
of
krispy
kreme
google
didn
t
have
any
of
krispy
kreme
s
problem
many
of
them
outline
in
the
article
such
as
federal
investigation
into
its
accounting
practice
a
sudden
drop
in
earnings
and
the
low
carb
diet
fad
eat
away
at
the
company
s
revenue
but
hey
google
have
hype
despite
the
public
pillory
of
the
ipo
google
management
still
considers
it
a
success
for
one
thing
all
the
publicity
have
the
effect
of
get
even
more
people
to
start
use
google
boost
its
market
share
we
make
quite
a
few
mistake
schmidt
concedes
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
company
go
public
in
a
way
that
generate
so
much
publicity
that
if
give
the
choice
of
do
it
the
conventional
way
or
an
odd
way
i
would
still
choose
the
odd
way
today
in
the
four
month
before
the
ipo
we
get
the
bad
press
we
d
ever
have
but
the
ipo
itself
be
a
marketing
event
the
new
york
time
write
about
it
on
the
editorial
page
everybody
have
an
opinion
you
can
t
buy
that
kind
of
publicity
i
watch
our
traffic
number
and
our
traffic
be
explode
but
how
could
the
press
have
gotten
the
story
so
wrong
blame
it
on
larry
and
sergey
they
be
try
to
do
something
right
instead
they
piss
off
a
lot
of
people
the
wisdom
of
a
crowd
ipo
once
again
larry
and

decide
to
break
the
rule
there
be
a
well
establish
method
to
the
madness
of
take
a
company
public
one
that
stretch
back
nearly
a
hundred
year
on
wall

the
unquestioned
rule
have
be
that
it
must
be
handle
by
expert
before
a

start
trading
publicly
private

who
supposedly
know
what

a

that
put
up

the

show
to
pitch
the
value
of
the
stock
to
their

who
price
the

this
isn

just
a

can
instantly
make

if
the

up
on

the
competition

it
conservatively

intense
but
with
enough

commit
their

competitive

should
set
the

just
right
that
anyway
be
the
theory
in

it
start
to
go
haywire
with
rabid

the

metric
for

a

take

public
and
then
see
the

double
triple
quadruple
on
the
first

this
become
a
rite
of

then
set
the

on
the

that
would
still
bring
in
enough
investor
to
buy
all
the
offer
stock
it
seem
like
a
good
idea
to
larry
and
sergey
they
like
the
notion
of
take
control
away
from
large
institution
which
always
get
the
best
deal
and
hand
the
opportunity
to
individual
in
they
consult
with
jay
ritter
a
university
of
florida
finance
professor
who
have
study
ipo
for
year
and
ask
what
he
thought
of
the
ipo
auction
system
he
point
out
that
it
be
less
likely
to
present
a
conflict
of
interest
i
told
them
an
auction
would
be
best
because
the
allocation
of
share
doesn
t
depend
on
what
kind
of
commission
a
professional
investor
generates
for
the
investment
banker
ritter
say
besides
larry
and
sergey
like
the
fact
that
price
would
be
set
by
the
wisdom
of
crowd
the
principle
they
use
to
determine
search
result
and
an
open
ipo

their
primary
constituency
individual
over
elite

in

larry

don
t
value
conventional

the
way
i
do
say
schmidt
whatever
the
conventional
wisdom
be
they
re
suspicious
of
it
they
felt
that
if
we
re
go
to
go
public
it
might
as
well
be
in
a
way
that
address
the
apparent
unfairness
of
the
process
in
a
letter
write
by
them
for
the

for
the

not
a

we
do
not
intend

it
be
important
to
us
to
have
a
fair
process
for
our
ipo
that
be
inclusive
of
both
small

this
have
lead
us
to
pursue
an
auction

for
our
entire
offering
when
the
investment
bank
make
their
pilgrimage
to

in

of
the
golden

they
found
that
they
didn

that
the
google

be
reluctant
to
make
such
an
unusual
jump
there
be
no
way
this
be
go
to
happen
he
say
the
team
told
him
they
go
back
to
larry
and
sergey
who
told
them
to
try
again
and
come
back
with
the
right
answer
one
google
executive
on
that
original
team
however
say
that
this
isn
t
true
they
simply
found
the
bank
to
be
too
small
and
poorly
organize
to
handle
such
an
important
transaction
either
way
they
decide
to
conduct
a
hybrid
ipo
use
the
auction
system
but
invite
many
bank
to
participate
their
golden
fleece
status
give
sergey
and
larry
enormous
leverage
over
wall
street
and
they
demand
a
lot
not
only
do
they
want
to
bypass
the
investment
bank
main
customer
to
offer
their
stock
to
average
small
investor
but
also
they
say
they
would
pay
only
half
the
usual
percent
fee
demand
by
the

goldman
one

be
relegate
to
minor

in

lead
many
to

that
this

revenge
from

schmidt
insists
this
be
not
true
you
typically
don
t
have
three
top
bank
take
the
lead
he
say
our
ipo
be
such
a
unique
design
we
go
with
the
one
who
show
the
most
flexibility
in
get
the
design
to
work
but
the
overwhelm
majority
of
the
bank
be
reluctant
participant
and
they
do
something
larry
and
sergey
do
not
anticipate
although
they
have
to
let
in
small
investor
they
have
the
right
to
determine
whether
an
investor
be
sophisticated
enough
to
participate
this
be
necessary
since
if
it
turn
out
that
the
price
drop
precipitously
after
the
ipo
the
bank
could
be
sue
for
lure
na
ve
investor
into
a
risky
transaction
most
small
investor
be
reject
some
reporter
try
to
participate
in
order
to
write
about
the
experience
but
could
not
get
in
even
when
use
money
put
up
by
their
publication
wr
hambrecht
be
the
one
that
let
small
investor
participate
most
small
investor
didn
t
want
in
anyway
the
ipo
which
would
have
be
enthusiastically
sell
by
the
bank
to
their
institutional
investor
be
instead
widely
criticize
in
the
investment
banking
community
i
talk
to
one
financial
adviser
at
an
investment
bank
participate
in
the
ipo
who
say
he
be
told
to
warn
off
individual
investor
because
the
whole
thing
be
too
much
of
a
mess
part
of
that
reaction
be
simple
fear
the
bank
have
never
do
anything
like
this
before
and
be
genuinely
scar
of
how
it
would
all
turn
out
but
part
of
it
be
just
a
reflection
of
their
anger
at
larry
and
sergey
and
their
demand
part
of
the
reaction
be
wall
street
anger
because
we
be
do
it
our
way
not
their
way
say
a
former
google
executive
who
follow
the
public
reaction
but
part
of
it
be
fear
in
the
brokerage
community
nobody
knew
how
it
would
come
out
it
be
a
hassle
for
the
broker
and
they
encourage
people
to
stay
away
larry
and
sergey
do
make
some
mistake
they
never
seem
to
take
the
ipo
process
very
seriously
month
before
they
set
the
process
in
motion
they
give
a
lengthy

to
playboy

one
of
the

before

the
time
between
start
the

and
the

in
which
the

anything
that
will

finally
larry

interested

the
specter
of

competition
primarily
from

the

that
both

it
have
more

than
google
which
be
entirely
dependent
on

yahoo
be
also
supposedly
more
profitable
than
google
reporter
express
incredulity
that
the
ipo
would
give
google
a
market
value
comparable
to
that
of
general
motor
all
these
flag
be
red
herring
that
any
business
reporter
should
have
know
to
discount
they
should
have
know
for
example
that
comparison
to
slow
growth
company
in
completely
unrelated
industry
be
irrelevant
when
compare
to
yahoo

google
s
valuation
be
reasonable

not
overly
conservative
google
s
net
revenue
million
in
have
nearly
triple
from
the
previous
year
while
yahoo
s
net
revenue
billion
have
grown
by
percent
clearly
put
google
on
a
track
to
quickly
bypass
yahoo
but
profit
not
revenue
be
the
primary
metric
for
value
a
company
s
stock
and
there
the
press
get
the
number
wrong
every
article
say
that
google
s
profit
be
million
while
yahoo
s
be
million
that
s
what
the
company
report
but
the
press
and
apparently
the
wall
street
analyst
overlook
one
important
fact
the
two
company
apply
vastly
different
write
offs
to
their
earnings
this
be
due
to
a
decision
by
larry
sergey
and
the
financial
team
at
google
to
make
their
financial
reporting
squeaky
clean
before
the
ipo
accounting
rule
require
company
to
write
off
different
expense
before
reporting
net
income
such
as
the
depreciation
of
the
value
of
the
equipment
they
own
one
of
the
big
expense
be
stock
option
incentive
to
keep
employee
by
allow
them
to
buy
company
stock
at
a
discount
yahoo
have
be
write
off
stock
option
for
year
but
about
to
become
a
public
company
google
write
off
a
huge
number
of
stock
option
in
million
versus
million
for
yahoo
since
many
of
these
discount
do
not
reflect
actual
expense
many
analyst
use
operating
income
before
expense
to
value
a
company
in
yahoo
s
operating
income
be
million
while
google
s
be
million
google
be
already
more
profitable
than
yahoo
and
grow
faster
none
of
the
wall
street
analyst
or
reporter
mention
this
fact
the
press
also
soundly
criticize
google
for
create
a
two
class
stock
system
the
common
stock
shareholder
be
to
get
one
vote
per
share
on
important
issue
while
larry
sergey
and
ceo
schmidt
get
ten
in
their
letter
in
the
prospectus
larry
and
sergey
explain
why
t
he
standard
structure
of
public
ownership
may
jeopardize
the
independence
and
focus
objectivity
that
have
be
most
important
in
google
s
past
success
and
that
we
consider
most
fundamental
for
its
future
therefore
we
have
implement
a
corporate
structure
that
be
design
to
protect
google
s
ability
to
innovate
and
retain
its
most
distinctive
characteristic
this
be
see
as
bad
corporate
governance
allow
the
executive
to
ignore
stockholder
demand
when
run
the
company
the
press
neglect
to
mention
that
most
of
their
own
parent
company
include
those
of
the
new
york
time
washington
post
and
wall
street
journal
have
similar
two
class
stock
system
for
exactly
the
same
reason
management
do
not
want
shareholder
to
pressure
them
into
maximize
profit
and
stock
price
quarter
to
quarter
while
sacrifice
long
term
goal
and
in
their
letter
to
shareholder
larry
and
sergey
clearly
warn
prospective
buyer
of
the
consequence
we
believe
a
dual
class
voting
structure
will
enable
google
as
a
public
company
to
retain
many
of
the
positive
aspect
of
be
private
we
understand
some
investor
do
not
favor
dual
class
structure
some
may
believe
that
our
dual
class
structure
will
give
us
the
ability
to
take
action
that
benefit
us
but
not
google
s
shareholder
as
a
whole
we
have
consider
this
point
of
view
carefully
and
we
and
the
board
have
not
make
our
decision
lightly
we
be
convince
that
everyone
associate
with
google
include
new
investor
will
benefit
from
this
structure
however
you
should
be
aware
that
google
and
its
shareholder
may
not
realize
these
intend
benefit
this
do
not
go
a
long
way
toward
make
investor
feel
more
comfortable
with
the
stock
the

as
say
the

be
more
balance
in
their
approach
to
the
google

than
they
be
five

they
re
reflect
a

this
time
the

be
burn
by

that
be
overly

by
a
bitter

larry
s

s
refusal
to
provide
any
information
beyond
the

which
take

what
do
larry

think
of
the
whole
process
there
s

in

google
s
original
estimate
of
the
value
of
the

it
would
sell
in
the

be
an
unusually
precise
most

round
it
off
to
the
near
million
or
so
and
the

report
it

over

mathematician
recognize
the

the

go
to

to
talk

about
a

spent
a
good
part
of
the
day
in
a
room
with
larry
and
sergey
and
talk
very
little
about
google
org
we
just
talk
about
life
and
where
they
want
to
go
say
dr
brilliant
and
they
be
amaze
i
have
never
met
anyone
like
them
before
i
hadn
t
work
for
anybody
in
about
forty
year
and
be
not
interested
in
the
idea
of
work
for
a
big
company
but
with
larry
and
sergey
i
change
my
mind
what
impressed
him
about
larry
and
sergey
be
their
over
the
top
idealism
and
extreme
desire
to
do
important
thing
for
the
world
when
he
arrive
at
google
to
talk
with
them
for
the
first
time
the
pair
have
just
decide
to
set
up
operation
in
china
which
meant
conform
to
china
s
strict
censorship
rule
thus
google
have
become
a
censor
and
it
grate
on
larry
and
sergey
s
conscience
it
become
the
topic
of
their
conversation
we
talk
about
whether
google
should
be
in
china
or
not
brilliant
say
every
question
come
back
to
what
s
the
morally
right
thing
to
do
the
topic
be
a
sensitive
one
for
google
i
don
t
think
there
s
any
big
company
in
the
u
s
that
isn
t
constantly
look
at
its
relationship
with
china
say
brilliant
it
s
a
huge
business
partner
and
it
s
an
unusual
business
partner
it
have
a
series
of
pressure
that
we
re
not
use
to
we
don
t
understand
them
very
well
but
whatever
the
issue
be
with
larry
and
sergey
it
would
come
down
to
what
s
the
morally
right
thing
to
do
that
s
one
thing
that
have
never
change
about
larry
and
sergey
to
this
day
say
brilliant
we
ve
be
through
a
lot
of
crazy
thing
and
never
once
have
there
be
an
issue
where
they
fail
to
make
the
correct
moral
decision
they
think
about
the
moral
issue
first
everything
else
be
secondary
include
whether
google
will
do
well
by
it
or
if
it
s
good
for
business
i
have
never
see
a
big
company
in
which
the
two
people
who
control
it
have
such
an
amazingly
strong
moral
base
it
feel
strange
to
say
that
to
somebody
write
a
book
because
it
sound
like
puffery
but
it
s
absolutely
true
it
s
why
i
come
to
google
yes
it
sound
like
spin
and
the
public
be
right
to
be
wary
of
such
claim
we
re
use
to
such
spin
control
from
big
corporation
such
as
oil
company
spout
about
the
great
thing
they
do
for
the
environment
without
ever
spill
a
drop
of
oil
but
everyone
who
have
have
close
contact
with
google
or
its
founder
come
away
assert
it
s
true
one
former
executive
with
no
reason
to
promote
the
company
anymore
asserts
everyone
in
the
company
really
do
believe
in
it
define
evil
increasingly
though
people
accuse
google
of
evil
deed
the
first
question
should
be
what
do
google
mean
by
evil
sergey
be
the
primary
arbiter
of
what
it
mean
not
to
be
evil
he
have
described
it
as
a
dedication
to
not
take
advantage
of
customer
as
well
as
try
to
do
good
thing
for
the
world
but
it
didn
t
start
as
a
promise
never
to
do
anything
that
others
might
think
be
wrong
such
as
chop
down
old
growth
redwood
tree
to
make
a
lot
of
money
it
start
as
an
internal
mandate
for
how
to
run
a
company
and
do
well
by
employee
it
first
come
up
at
google
when
a
few
executive
be
try
to
make
a
decision
about
a
group
of
employee
who
do
not
seem
to
be
work
out
one
of
the
executive
turn
to
the
others
and
say
let
s
just
do
this
but
don
t
be
evil
about
it
at
another
meeting
a
few
day
later
someone
say
the
same
thing
eventually
the
rule
be
write
down
and
institutionalize
say
google
economist
hal
varian
it
become
something
of
a
principle
not
something
laid
down
from
above
it
come
about
organically
it
be
about
internal
function
later
when
larry
and
sergey
write
the
founder
letter
to
shareholder
for
the
ipo
they
incorporate
it
into
the
letter
now
google
be
stuck
with
it
everything
the
company
do
big
or
small
be
judged
on
whether
the
act
be
consider
ethical
and
in
fact
larry
and
sergey
themselves
have
extend
the
definition
to
include
business
practice
on
the
corporate
web
site
under
the
head
ten
thing
google
have
found
to
be
true
the
principle
be
number
six
on
the
list
you
can
make
money
without
do
evil
the
part
about

in
the

they

about
treat

about

a

practice
employ
by
all
other
search
engine
when
google
be
start
some
may
interpret
that
view
as
one
that
say
we
re
moral
and
you
re
not
but
craig
silverstein
who
have
be
with
google
from
its
found
say
it
s
more
subtle
than
that
larry
and
sergey
do
not
believe
corporation
be
intrinsically
evil
he
say
they
believe
and
google
s
corporate
philosophy
be
that
be
a
corporation
it
s
still
possible
to
be
an
ethical
company
you
can
be
much
more
successful
that
way
to
simply
say
that
google
have
indeed
be
more
successful
that
way
understates
the
definition
of
success
google
s
moral
compass
have
do
it
well
in
an
age
of
hyper
competition
but
with
the
wide
publicity
of
the
principle
that
become
described
as
simply
don
t
be
evil
google
found
that
it
have
almost
impossible
expectation
to
live
up
to
say
andrew
anker
the
former
wire
digital
executive
it
be
clear
to
me
that
they
would
push
the
wrong
button
the
issue
be
don
t
pretend
that
you
aren
t
evil
anker
believe
that
the
sheer
success
of
google
make
it
suspect
nobody
can
have
a
seventy
five
percent
market
share
and
still
be
like
you
re
go
to
piss
people
off
and
those
thing
will
snowball
people
want
cuddly
sergey
and
larry
doll
the
problem
google
be
have
be
that
the
more
warm
and
cuddly
people
be
the
more
disappointed
you
be
when
they
let
you
down
and
they
do
let
people
down
liberal
censor
for
one
thing
google
and
all
major
online
service
be
voluntary
censor
larry
and
sergey
come
to
the
reluctant
view
against
their
instinct
that
censorship
sometimes
serf
their
user
self
interest
to
some
extent
they
convince
themselves
of
that
concept
but
they
do
so
slowly
and
thoughtfully
weigh
many
fact
before
come
to
this
conclusion
larry
and
sergey
all
of
us
in
fact
have
a
culturally
liberal
view
say
google
ceo
eric
schmidt
we
all
have
to
be
in
a
room
together
larry
say
if
it
s
something
that
s
go
to
end
up
in
the
newspaper
we
have
to
understand
it
the
session
be
not
simply
meeting
of
like
mind
between
the
three
of
us
on
any
particular
issue
we
ll
disagree
on
the
detail
say
schmidt
we
go
around
and
around
on
the
issue
when
the
discussion
go
around
it
end
up
in
larry
s
and
sergey
s
lap
a
few
year
ago
when
ask
by
a
reporter
from
wire
magazine
what
defines
evil
schmidt
jokingly
say
whatever
sergey
say
it
be
more
recently
he
told
me
the
rule
be
it
depends
we
don
t
actually
have
a
one
paragraph
rule
our
process
be
to
rely
on
people
with
good
judgment
as
computer
scientist
they
take
great
pride
in
rely
on
the
smart
people
they
have
hire
as
long
as
they
dig
up
the
fact
to
justify
their
position
schmidt
say
google
s
dedication
to
the
fact
be
strong
than
that
at
almost
any
other
company
an
awful
lot
of
business
be
run
base
on
intuition
experience
all
those
thing
which
we
don
t
value
very
much
we
value
the
analytical
prove
it
approach
i
ll
make
a
broad
criticism
a
lot
of
executive
look
nice
they
re
smart
they
re
well
spoken
they
give
nice
speech
they
use
all
the
right
marketing
word
but
they
re
not
fundamentally
insightful
because
they
didn
t
start
from
an
analytical
premise
larry
and
sergey
get
their
expert
to
collect
all
the
fact
about
these
issue
then
debate
them
in
meeting
and
set
the
general
policy
the
executive
responsible
for
the
detail
then
make
the
decision
on
the
particular
issue
but
with
the
approval
of
the
founder
especially
when
they
be
controversial
one
while
they
don
t
like
censorship
and
try
to
avoid
it
wherever
possible
they
have
come
to
accept
the
difficult
fact
that
it
s
impossible
to
do
business
in
the
world
without
it
a
couple
of
year
ago
management
refuse
to
block
the
search
engine
from
point
people
to
an
anti
semitic
site
call
jewwatch
blogger
angrily
decry
that
decision
as
essentially
condone
evil
sergey
publicly
defend
the
company
s
position
as
an
anti
censorship
stance
and
of
course
all
the
publicity
increase
traffic
to
the
site
but
sometimes
sergey
feel
the
company
have
no
choice
but
to
remove
material
several
year
ago
for
example
the
church
of
scientology
make
a
copyright
claim
against
an
anti
scientology
site
that
have
excerpt
text
from
the
church
s
writing
sergey
saw
it
as
a
free
speech
issue
but
have
to
back
down
because
the
anti
scientology
site
do
remove
the
material
rather
than
fight
when
google
do
remove

the

the

be
a
short
smart

good
at
what

considerable
freedom

propose
solution
to
difficult
issue
such
as
censorship
have
earn
the
trust
of
the
founder
but
she
make
it
clear
that
the
standard
she
us
be
set
by
larry
and
sergey
particularly
sergey
who
attend
most
of
the
meeting
where
these
issue
be
discuss
it
s
wong
s
job
to
convince
larry
and
sergey
that
her
answer
be
the
right
one
the
approach
that
our
founder
and
eric
have
believe
in
and
which
i
think
be
the
right
approach
be
that
when
it
come
to
restriction
on
speech
we
should
do
so
narrowly
in
consideration
of
a
wide
range
of
factor
she
note
that
in
the
early
year
of
the
internet
when
larry
and
sergey
developed
their
attitude
base
on
pure
idealism
the
main
constituency
be
the
united
state
canada
western
europe
and
australia
all
country
with
largely
similar
principle
of
freedom
of
speech
google
be
now
operating
search
engine
in
seventy
language
censorship
be
not
just
a
chinese
syndrome
china
s
censorship
be
just
the
most
visible
wong
clarifies
the
point
we
re
now
hit
a
new
generation
of
country
with
both
culture
and
government
that
be
not
on
the
same
page
in
term
of
freedom
of
speech
she
say
we
ve
see
large
scale
censorship
effort
in
turkey
in
brazil
in
korea
in
india
that
s
be
a
challenge
for
all
of
us
include
all
the
other
search
engine
how
do
we
operate
in
the
world
and
do
it
responsibly
china
be
one
of
the
long
debate
focal
point
but
i
really
believe
we
must
keep
our
eye
on
the
ball
in
every
other
country
that
have
similar
instinct
which
be
to
shut
it
off
to
block
the
site
to
take
down
that
url
the
german
government
for
example
demand
that
google
and
any
other
internet
site
operating
in
that
country
censor
site
that
publish
or
distribute
nazi
material
google
block
such
site
from
its
german
de
domain
but
not
at
google
com
or
other
country
domain
and
the
united
state
cut
short
its
free
speech
allowance
when
it
come
to
writing
that
promote
violence
child
pornography
and
other
illegal
activity
nobody
complains
about
the
fact
that
google
keep
its
search
engine
from
lead
people
in
germany
or
the
united
state
to
ban
site
the
slope
toward
the
abyss
of
censorship
be
almost
impossible
to
avoid
censorship
be
a
judgment
call
involve
not
only
government
law
but
cultural
attitude
as
well
wong
point
out
one
dilemma
that
come
up
in
someone
post
a
video
on
youtube
that
be
highly
critical
of
the
king
of
thailand
bhumibol
adulyadej
the
video
which
do
not
come
from
thailand
itself
be
unquestionably
disrespectful
say
wong
show
the
king
with
a
monkey
face
for
example
or
pose
in
compromise
position
but
be
they
illegal
in
the
united
state
where
political
and
other
public
figure
be
regularly
parody
mercilessly
they
would
be
allow
under
the
law
of
free
speech
thailand
be
a
different
story
wong
travel
to
thailand
to
research
the
issue
personally
she
discover
first
of
all
that
thailand
do
have
a
law
against
insult
the
king
the
king
who
be
eighty
four
year
old
and
be
crown
in
be
deeply
love
as
an
important
stable
and
respect
figure
in
a
country
that
have
be
characterize
by
many
coup
in
the
last
two
decade
the
reverence
for
the
king
across
thailand
be
absolutely
uniform
she
say
that
law
be
a
prime
example
of
crystallize
the
view
of
the
people
when
she
arrive
in
thailand
for
example
an
american
living
there
told
her
that
to
the
thai
people
the
king
be
a
cross
between
george
washington
jesus
christ
and
elvis
presley
wong
have
arrive
on
a
monday
which
happens
to
be
the
day
of
the
week
the
king
be
born
every
monday
the
thai
people
honor
his
royal
color
yellow
when
wong
walk
out
into
the
street
virtually
everyone
be
wear
a
yellow
shirt
with
the
king
s
image
on
it
what
that
told
me
be
totally
aside
from
what
the
law
may
be
the
criticism
of
the
king
which
in
the
united
state
would
be
cast
as
political
speech
have
deep
cultural
significance
in
thailand
in
the
end
she
decide
it
be
right
to
block
the
offend
video
in
thailand
i
don
t
dismiss
the
validity
of
have
different
norm
about
what
s
okay
for
me
to
say
to
you
in
thailand
or
what
s
okay
for
me
to
say
to
you
elsewhere
it
s
just
different
and
it
s
upon
us
to
figure
out
how
we
offer
a
global
platform
that
get
that
right
wong
firmly
believe
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
in
offering
our
service
it
s
not
just
that
all
the
information
ought
to
be
out
there
it
s
also
be
we
respect
what
people
want
to
hear
what
they
re
accept
of
hearing
or
be
we
post
what
essentially
amount
to
obscenity
for
them
i
have
to
get
to
the
country
to
figure
it
out
but
i
totally
understand
it
at
this
point
but
the
point
where
she
draw
the
line
be
when
official
try
to
expand
censorship
across
national
boundary
turkish
official
cross
it
recently
when
they
ask
google
for
a
worldwide
ban
on
youtube
video
that
violate
turkish
law
by
insult
the
founder
of
modern
turkey
mustafa
kemal
atat
rk
at
first
google
respond
to
turkish
complaint
by
block
the
offensive
video
only
in
turkey
but
in
june
turkish
official
demand
that
google
block
the
video
worldwide
to
protect
the
right
and
sensitivity
of
turk
living
abroad
google
refuse
and
turkish
censor
block
all
of
youtube
from
be
see
in
their
country
a
difficult
decision
to
the
top
management
at
google
these
issue
illustrate
the
complexity
and
subtlety
of
the
issue
of
censorship
and
they
re
still
learn
i
consider
us
to
still
be
in
our
infancy
say
wong
like
we
re
go
to
take
a
corner
too
fast
and
hit
our
head
on
the
wall
but
this
be
an
excite
time
for
us
all
to
figure
out
how
to
get
it
right
the
decision
to
go
to
china
be
the
most
difficult
one
they
make
despite
the
conclusion
of
wong
which
they
ultimately
accepted
censorship
should
be
anathema
to
a
company
like
google
and
china
be
perhaps
the
bad
offender
target
dissident
reporter
and
political
foe
as
well
as

who
participate
in
the

with

to
them
it
be
a
decision
with
implication
that
would
affect
the
future
of
the

itself
in
they
finally
launch

furious
some
of
the
criticism
be
off

many
insist
that
google
should
just
stick
with
its
offshore
chinese
search
engine
and
try
to
get
thing
past
the
censor
as
much
as
possible
rather
than
give
in
to
china
s
demand
google
still
run
its
offshore
site
but
since
google
doesn
t
censor
the
result
of
that
site
the
chinese
government
often
block
access

use

know
facetiously
as
the
great

of
china
the

finally
decide
that
wasn
t
good
enough
a
huge
part
of
the
discussion
we
have
internally
be
whether
we
would
have
a
chance
to
make
a
meaningful
contribution
in
china
by
stand
outside
say

with
the

of
the

in

it
be
not
just
that

it
s
that
you
re

nobody

you
do

succeed
in
the
fast
grow

large
market
in
the

it
have
to
be
part

they

china
claim
the

large

more

at

the

s
offshore

start
to
falter
in
china
as
baidu
which
obeys
the
censorship
law
grow
in
an
august
report
the
china
internet
network
information
center
cnnic
report
that
google
s
market
share
in
china
have
drop
from
its
lead
position
to
second
place
behind
baidu
google
s
market
share
come
in
at
percent
while
baidu
s
hit
percent
at
first
google
s
response
be
to
buy
about
a
percent
stake
in
baidu
but
in
january
it
announce
it
be
opening
its
own
operation
in
china
which
meant
agree
to
self
censor
forbidden
topic
google
sell
its
baidu
share
several
month
after
that
announcement
it
turn
out
to
be
the
decision
that
have
do
the
most
harm
to
google
s
reputation
across
the
internet
blogger
denounce
google
as
have
officially
join
the
rank
of
evil
corporation
once
google
start
operating
on
chinese
soil
it
have
to
conform
to
chinese
law
include
censor
its
own
site
or
face
the
consequence
just
after
google
launch
its
chinese
operation
ceo
schmidt
told
me
we
have
to
obey
chinese
law
or
our
employee
there
will
be
arrest
and
torture
i
have
a
problem
with
that
a
big
part
of
the
rationale
behind
take
the
cold
plunge
into
china
be
the
idea
that
operating
on
chinese
soil
would
benefit
chinese
user
in
order
to
set
up
an
office
in
china
google
s
executive
have
to
agree
to
block
certain
site
and
topic
from
its
search
result
base
on
a
list
provide
by
the
chinese
government
but
this
also
meant
that
the
chinese
firewall
would
no
longer
block
access
to
google
s
site
give
google
more
control
over
its
site
and
ensure
that
it
would
run
more
efficiently
google
s
executive
also
have
the
hope
perhaps
naively
that
more
competition
would
help
open
up
the
restrictive
practice
of
that
fast
develop
country
as
it
move
into
take
a
capitalist
and
more
international
stance
just
the
presence
of
the
internet
even
under
restriction
flood
every
country
with
more
information
than
it
have
ever
see
before
say
wong
anyone
who
believe
in
freedom
of
speech
have
to
think
this
be
the
most
excite
time
we
ve
ever
be
in
this
be
the
big
democratization
of
speech
we
ve
ever
see
which
mean
that
you
or
i
or
my
five
year
old
have
essentially
the
same
platform
as
abc
news
or
the
new
york
time
or
businessweek
and
that
s
huge
and
it
s
fraught
with
lot
of
problem
it
s
somewhat
on
the
paradigm
of
that
classic
diplomatic
question
isolate
or
engage
at
the
end
of
the
day
we
decide
to
engage
because
we
believe
that
be
there
would
have
more
possibility
of
move
thing
in
the
right
direction
than
refuse
to
be
there
and
perhaps
google
s
presence
will
make
a
difference
unlike
google
baidu
do
insert
paid
ad
into
the
search
result
which
reportedly
account
for
about
percent
of
the

revenue
press
report
have
recently
allege
that
those
paid
insert
include

from
illegal
medical
company
and
when
the
scandal
over
taint

erupt
in

in
another

accuse

from
the

industry
in
return
for

about

it
be

though
that
move
into

have
not
help
google

which
have
continued

late
baidu

grabbed
a

be
it
a
good

sergey
be

with
his
answer
oh
you

the

that
just
turn
over
information
about
one
of
its

to
the
chinese

get
him

in
january
larry
and
sergey
acknowledge
that
the
negative
publicity
over
the
move
have
harm
the
company
s
reputation
on
a
business
level
that
decision
to
censor
be
a
net
negative
sergey
admit
larry
have
displayed
a
more
pragmatic
response
believe
that
they
make
the
right
decision
even
if
outsider
criticize
it
i
don
t
think
we
as
a
company
should
be
make
decision
base
on
too
much
perception
he
say
at
the
same
meeting
and
at
the
most
recent
annual
meeting
in
sergey
abstain
from
voting
against
the
late
proposal
to
do
something
about
chinese
censorship
proposal
that
would
setup
new
committee
to
examine
google
s
censorship
policy
in
china
he
felt
there
be
some
merit
to
the
idea
but
neither
do
he
vote
in
favor
of
the
proposal
sergey
also
cling
to
the
belief
that
google
can
make
a
difference
in
china
by
push
the
envelope
of
how
to
censor
when
google
start
its
google
cn
site
for
example
it
take
the
extra
step
of
let
searcher
know
that
information
they
be
look
for
have
be
remove
in
accordance
with
government
law
even
if
we
can
t
deliver
that
information
at
least
a
user
know
it
s
go
that
there
be
information
that
be
block
say
wong
that
s
a
form
of
transparency
chinese
user
have
never
see
before
we
re
never
go
to
be
happy
about
remove
information
but
if
we
can
make
people
aware
of
it
it
s
still
move
the
ball
forward
since
google
start
that
practice
and
get
away
with
it
the
other
chinese
search
engine
have
start
post
similar
notice
and
it
have
become
standard
practice
wong
also
argues
that
foreign
company
do
business
in
china
include
google
can
t
help
but
make
western
attitude
rub
off
on
the
country
s
people
we
be
employ
some
of
the
smartest
computer
scientist
in

they
be
work
on
hard
problem
and
be
be
expose
to
some
of
our
culture
and
our
mission
as
they
do
so
that
s
something
that
we
will
bring
to
china
that
i
feel
really
good
about
and
with
effort
sometimes
questionable
item
do
get
past
the

the
list
provide
by
the
chinese
censor
be
not
always
consistent
and
leave
room
for
interpretation
a
study
from
the
university
of
toronto
in
found
that
not
all
search

censor
equally
when
researcher
test
a
series
of
controversial
subject
on
the
major
search
engine
in

they
found
that
baidu
have
filter
out
percent
of
the

yahoo

while
msn
and

an

that

be
censor
by
at

one
of
the

but
only
be
censor
by
all
four
perhaps
this
leaf
room
for
create
an

at

to
examine
more
carefully
what

insists
they
offer
tougher

to
which

will

this
do
not

thievery
to
larry
and
sergey
collect
such
data
be
all
part
of
the
process
of
make
google
s
service
useful
but
people
be
suspicious
of
their
intent
google
could
for
example
sell
information
to
advertiser
and
other
company
just
as
magazine
sell
information
about
their
reader
to
others
there
be
no
evidence
google
have
ever
do
this
and
larry
and
sergey
promise
the
company
never
will
at
least
not
as
long
as
they
re
in
charge
explains
larry
whenever
you
do
a
search
you
re
trust
us
to
give
you
the
right
thing
we
take
that
very
seriously
we
have
a
pretty
good
reputation
in
that
regard
i
think
people
see
us
as
willing
to
take
position
that
some
might
find
weird
initially
but
we
definitely
can
explain
why
we
do
it
and
we
re
up
front
about
that
but
if
any
government
hit
google
with
a
legal
subpoena
the
company
have
to
turn
over
the
data
request
technically
such
data
do
not
identify
an
individual
but
merely
the
internet
address
of
a
user
s
computer
but
the
data
can
be
use
to
find
individual
or
at
least
those
whose
computer
be
use
by
dig
up
the
owner
of
the
computer
at
that
address
through
other
mean
privacy
advocate
and
certain
government
press
google
to
delete
this
information
after
a
short
period
of
time
government
do
so
naively
believe
that
the
potential
threat
be
from
google
s
abuse
the
information
but
it
actually
mean
it
will
make
it
harder
for
the
government
to
snoop
out
illegal
activity
the
dispute
larry
and
sergey
have
with
delete
data
be
how
long
that
period
should
be
wong
say
it
come
down
to
one
other
reason
google
collect
user
data
it
help
determine
traffic
pattern
that
may
identify
cybercrooks
enable
the
company
to
prevent
similar
attack
in
the
future
in
this
case
wong
again
argues
that
preserve
the
data
be
the
best
way
to
serve
user
focus
on
user
be
not
just
deliver
the
best
and
most
robust
service
but
also
deliver
a
service
that
the
user
will
trust
a
component
of
that
trust
be
about
privacy
because
this
be
such
a
data
driven
service
can
you
trust
google
user
trust
be
an
absolute
necessity
for
google
and
violate
it
or
even
the
perception
of
violate
it
threatens
the
company
s
future
competitiveness
it
s
also
one
of
wong
s
responsibility
as
part
of
her
job
she
meet
regularly
with
product
developer
start
at
the
early
design
stage
when
a
new
product
be
still
just
a
sketch
on
a
whiteboard
she
asks
the
developer
what
information
they
plan
to
collect
with
the
product
how
they
plan
to
use
it
with
whom
the
data
will
be
share
and
how
it
will
be
kept
secure
the
issue
be
then
discuss
with
larry
sergey
and
eric
and
their
recommendation
be
design
into
the
product
one
of
the
mandate
be
to
inform
user
rigorously
about
how
the
information
be
use
when
someone
downloads
google
s
toolbar
they
have
to
click
on
a
box
in
order
to
allow
pagerank
to
collect
data
about
their
surf
habit
if
they
do
so
a
privacy
notice
pop
up
to
explain
how
the
information
be
use
with
a
head
in
bold
red
letter
that
say
please
read
carefully
it
s
not
the
usual
yada
yada
larry
and
sergey
set
the
mandate
that
user
must
be
provide
with
transparency
a
clear
explanation
of
what
the
company
be
up
to
and
the
choice
of
whether
or
not
to
allow
it
even
if
the
user
decide
they
don
t
want
their
data
collect
they
can
still
download
the
toolbar
without
activate
pagerank
that
buck
the
trend
still
prevalent
for
many
internet
company
that
say
essentially
if
you
don
t
accept
the
term
then
you
can
t
use
the
product
similarly
when
use
google
s
instant
message
system
google
talk
user
can
choose
the
option
of
go
off
the
record
which
prevents
google
and
the
people
chat
from
keep
any
record
of
the
conversation
still
most
people
do
not
choose
the
privacy
option
and
google
keep
the
data
but
it
have
learn
to
compromise
originally
google
do
not
put
any
limitation
on
the
length
of
time
it
would
keep
the
data
privacy
advocate
complain
both
to
google
and
to
government
regulator
so
in
wong
begin
a
series
of
meeting
with
the
product
designer
ask
them
why
they
need
such
data
the
log
improve
search
spell
check
feature
and
other
service
but
a
big
part
of
the
reason
they
keep
data
say
the
developer
be
to
ensure
the
security
of
the
network
any
internet
company
be
subject
to
spam
fraud
and
attack
know
as
denial
of
service
in
which
a
site
be
inundate
with
dozen
of
automatically
generate
request
in
order
to
slow
it
down
or
make
it
crash
by
keep
the
data
google
can
identify
any
pattern
that
lead
up
to
an
attack
and
the
computer
use
to
instigate
it
use
the
information
to
prevent
similar
future
attack
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
that
the
person
successfully
attack
us
today
have
probably
be
try
for
two
year
say
wong
so
when
we
go
back
into
the
log
for
a
substantial
amount
of
time
we
re
able
to
detect
the
pattern
we
have
today
we
can
figure
out
all
of
the
pattern
we
re
see
in
an
attack
we
ask
what
s
the
next
step
of
this
attack
what
s
the
best
way
for
us
to
try
and
stop
it
it
be
a
historical
record
that
help
us
get
to
the
answer
that
we
need
today
wong
then
ask
the
developer
how
long
they
actually
need
to
keep
the
data
in
order
to
maintain
security
after
collect
that
feedback
and
reporting
to
larry
and
sergey
google
set
its
policy
it
would
keep
the
data
for
only
eighteen
month
anonymizing
it
after
that
so
no
individual
or
computer
could
be
identify
this
placate
no
one
so
google
engineer
kept
work
on
the
problem
to
see
if
they
could
cut
that
retention
time
the
end
result
be
that
in
google
announce
that
it
would
reduce
the
length
of
time
data
be
kept
by
half
to
nine
month
our
engineer
say
that
they
thought
they
could
still
get
pretty
good
result
pretty
good
robustness
pretty
good
security
base
on
nine
month
say
wong
and
i
ll
be
really
candid
we
re
give
up
some
quality
some
ability
to
get
really
good
search
result
faster
because
we
don
t
have
that
historical
record
but
we
think
we
ve
built
a
system
now
and
improve
our
analytical
tool
that
will
get
us
what
we
really
really
need
in
nine
month
this
present
another
dilemma
that
force
larry
and
sergey
to
compromise
to
them
user
experience
be
of
paramount
importance
and
the
complaint
about
privacy
be
overblown
there
have
never
be
a
document
case
of
google
violate
its
user
privacy
either
lose
control
accidentally
or
engage
in
such
practice
as
sell
information
to
spammer
every
complaint
about
google
fall
into
the
category
of
what
could
happen
not
what
have
happen
in
general
google
have
do
a
well
job
of
protect
people
s
privacy
than
its
competitor
in
august
the
u
s
department
of
justice
issue
subpoena
to
google
america
online
microsoft
and
yahoo
to
turn
over
two
month
worth
of
search
query
and
all
the
url
in
their
index
to
aid
in
the
bush
administration
s
defense
of
an
internet
pornography
law
every
company
except
google
quickly
comply
with
the
subpoena
google
challenged
it
in
court
as
a
fishing
expedition
with
no
probable
cause
in
the
end
google
manage
to
restrict
the
information
to
fifty
thousand
web
address
and
do
not
have
to
turn
over
information
on
the
key
word
user
be
use
to
search
in
fact
most
internet
user
worry
about
privacy
less
than
they
should
and
do
little
to
protect
themselves
from
it
but
they
do
want
the
company
they
deal
with
to
provide
the
protection
for
them
and
they
rely
on
privacy
advocate
to
force
the
issue
on
their
behalf
the
privacy
advocate
and
government
regulator
raise
the
complaint
with
input
from
an
extreme
minority
of
user
this
mean
that
by
cut
the
data
retention
time
larry
and
sergey
accepted
a
compromise
they
feel
be
not
really
necessary
and
sacrifice
some
of
the
user
experience
as
a
result
which
can
be
see
as
a
violation
of
google
s
promise
to
focus
on
the
need
of
its
user
wong
say
that
acceptance
come
from
the
need
to
maintain
the
public
trust
the
public
complaint
from
privacy
advocate
affect
the
overall
public
view
of
google
it
s
a
tough
balance
she
say
but
if
we
don
t
do
something
to
respect
our
user
privacy
that
can
be
just
as
deadly
as
deliver
a
poor
service
if
the
public
think
we
re
selfishly
keep
data
that
we
re
at
risk
of
a
hack
attack
and
all
of
this
data
be
store
there
then
we
re
go
to
lose
their
trust
and
they
won
t
come
no
matter
how
good
the
service
be
that
may
still
be
a
problem
many
privacy
advocate
include
the
well
respect
electronic
frontier
foundation
eff
and
the
european
union
still
want
google
to
cut
the
retention
time
to
six
month
wong
say
it
s
not
possible
without
seriously
compromise
security
and
user
experience
nevertheless
wong
say
the
company
work
well
with
organization
such
as
the
eff
where
her
point
person
be
one
of
her
former
colleague
all
their
recommendation
be
take
to
the
team
include
larry
and
sergey
for
discussion
but
a
large
number
of
complaint
also
come
from
people
who
express
their
opinion
in
the
press
without
ever
have
spoken
with
google
or
try
the
product
in
question
wong
say
she
get
her
fair
share
of
complaint
from
people
who
don
t
really
seem
to
want
to
solve
problem
but
just
want
to
cause
a
harangue
some
of
the
complaint
be
just
crazy
and
be
dismiss
with
anger
one
advocate
for
example
call
her
and
argue
that
google
should
not
retain
any
user
search
history
at
all
even
though
user
frequently
use
them
to
find
site
they
ve
visit
in
the
past
that
they
want
to
visit
again
the
advocate
s
suggestion
user
should
just
write
down
on
paper
the
url
of
site
they
ve
visit
keep
them
safe
from
snoop
eye
or
at
least
those
who
don
t
have
access
to
their
desk
drawer
wong
insists
that
google
be
not
just
another
company
that
creates
a
product
and
toss
it
to
the
corporate
attorney
to
sign
off
on
privacy
here
be
a
concern
for
everyone
from
our
engineer
to
our
executive
that
s
a
really
unique
environment
to
work
in
i
don
t
think
people
always
understand
that
aspect
or
maybe
they
don
t
believe
it
because
there
be
certainly
enough
company
out
there
as
a
counterexample
but
i
believe
it
s
true
and
this
be
my
group
so
she
trail
off
with
a
laugh
will
these
discussion
continue
as
google
grows
big
and
more
powerful
if
nothing
else
larry
and
sergey
will
be
force
to
maintain
this
kind
of
structure
to
acknowledge
and
deal
with
complaint
if
they
compromise
their
ideal
in
the
name
of
profit
they
be
likely
to
be
less
successful
their
ideal
be
what
make
google
stand
out
and
engender
trust
from
million
of
people
wong
point
out
that
when
google
be
young
it
do
not
follow
the
example
of
other
internet
company
which
regularly
and
deeply
mine
data
about
their
user
sometimes
sell
the
information
to
advertiser
we
didn
t
need
to
do
that
she
note
and
we
re
wildly
successful
but
on
these
issue
public
perception
be
everything
and
google
be
struggle
to
convince
user
it
s
do
the
right
thing
every
move
it
make
as
it
grows
more
powerful
be
scrutinize
and
criticize
telemarketers
spammer
and
junk
mailer
have
create
huge
skepticism
about
how
any
advertising
megalith
will
use
the
data
at
its
disposal
and
there
seem
to
be
little
google
can
do
about
this
jim
barnett
the
ceo
of
the
online
advertising
firm
turn
sum
up
the
sentiment
the
truth
be
that
google
do
care
about
user
privacy
and
try

put
on
hold
while
they
start
up

and
focus
on

but
it
be
never
abandon
the

do
not
have
all
the

s
information
and
almost
none
of
the

that
be
create
before
but
physical
library
be
a
rich
storehouse
of
information
create
through
the
age
library
be
the
obvious
source
to
tap
for
book
since
percent
of
publish
work
be
now
out
of

the
large

have
spent
decade
or
even
hundred
of
year
building
their

and
some
percent
of
their
inventory
consists
of
book
that
be
no
longer
be
publish
some
of
them
very
old
sergey
and
larry
want
to
access
that
treasure
every
bit
as
much
as
the
ptolemy
clan
the
plan
to
realize
that
dream
start
come
together
in
the
first
problem
they
have
to
face
be
how
to
get
the
book
into
digital
form
they
wonder
how
long
it
would
take
to
scan
and
digitize
every
book
in
the
world
so
larry
decide
to
find
out
by
scan
one
book
he
and
marissa
mayer
then
a
product
manager
take
a
camera
a
three
hundred
page
book
and
a
metronome
into
his
office
use
the
metronome
to
keep
time
marissa
turn
the
page
while
larry
photograph
each
one
it
take
them
forty
minute
to
capture
all
three
hundred
page
larry
and
a
small
team
then
start
visit
other
book
digitization
project
include
one
at
his
undergraduate
alma
mater
the
university
of
michigan
there
he
learn
that
the
university
estimate
the
time
need
to
digitize
all
seven
million
book
it
own
be
one
thousand
year
he
told
university
of
michigan
president
mary
sue
coleman
that
google
could
do
it
in
six
he
also
make
what
be
then
an
unusual
move
for
a
software
company
by
hire
robotics
engineer
to
create
a
robotic
page
turner
and
scanner
that
could
replace
marissa
and
larry
and
their
metronome
such
device
already
exist
on
the
market
from
other
company
but
larry
thought
that
a
good
team
at
google
could
do
a
well
job
by
building
a
very
gentle
device
that
could
handle
old
book
with
fragile
page
software
programmer
at
google
create
a
page
recognition
software
program
that
could
recognize
odd
type
size
and
unusual
font
in
different
language
the
team
then
start
visit
large
library
to
discus
their
plan
at
the
oxford
university
library
they
examine
century
old
book
that
be
store
carefully
away
and
rarely
brought
out
and
then
only
for
qualify
scholar
the
googlers
talk
enthusiastically
about
digitize
them
and
make
them
available
to
anyone
after
more
than
a
year
of
discussion
oxford
end
up
become
google
s
first
partner
in
the
google

initiative
later
rename
google
book

with
an
agreement
to
digitize
its

of
more
than
one
million
nineteenth
century
book
within
three
year
the

dilemma
that
part
be
easy
two
hundred
year
old
book
be
no
longer
under
copyright
but
larry
also
want
more
recent
title
some
in
print
some
not
for
this
he
need
the
help
of
somebody
who
knew
his
way
around
the
publishing
business

it
caught
the

as
usual
the

be
a
big
industry
and
the
internet
be
go
to

so
how
can

larry
be

with
smith

travel

to

this
be
larry
s
intent
from
the
start
his
goal
typically
as
ambitious
as
those
of
ptolemy
i
we
want
all
the
world
s
book
in
every
language
say
smith
and
we
want
to
be
able
to
search
across
the
full
text
of
all
book
at
first
they
thought
the
idea
of
digitize
book
would
be
easily
palatable
for
one
thing
all
publisher
be
watch
the
write
word
go
digital
and
be
struggle
to
find
a
way
to
join
the
revolution
the
industry
be
just
come
off
its
first
wave
of
ebook
strategy
recall
smith
they
didn
t
get
the
traction
they
be
expect
it
wasn
t
clear
that
left
to
their
own
device
they
would
be
able
to
make
electronic
book
available
to
the
public
smith
and
his
team
found
a
receptive
audience
they
met
with
major
publisher
and
offer
the
same
deal
they
have
give
the
library
the
publisher
would
supply
the
book
and
google
would
digitize
them
put
them
online
make
short
excerpt
available
to
the
public
and
provide
link
to
site
where
people
could
buy
the
book
if
interested
google
would
cover
all
expense
and
wouldn
t
even
collect
any
fee
for
refer
buyer
although
publisher
could
also
run
ad
along
with
the
displayed
text
pay
for
click
in
a
bidding
auction
like
any
other
advertiser
in
the
case
of
book
under

people
would
be
able
to
search
through
them
to
find
a
piece
of
information
but
google
would
provide
only
short
snippet
of
text
at
a
time
for
publisher
that
want
it
access
would
be
far
limited
by
restrict
the
amount
of
text
available
to
just
percent
of
the
book
per
month
google
argue
that
the
main
benefit
to
publisher
would
be
to
raise
the
profile
of
book
for
sale
most
people
don
t
want
to
read
an
entire
book
online

would
rather
buy
an
easy
toread
paper
version
if
they
found
the
book
interest
enough
google
s
approach
say
smith
be
to
offer
an
experience
that
be
akin
to
walk
into
a
bookstore
and
flip
through
book
in
each
publishing
house
they
found
someone
to
champion
google
s
idea
many
of
them
say
yes
some
of
them
on
a
provisional
basis
to
see
how
well
the
program
work
some
balk
at
the
concept
that
offering
free
access
to
book
would
cause
people
to
buy
them
google
also
make
the
program
available
to
anyone
with
a
book
for

that
for

the

would
be
comparable

it

make

we

off

some

far
into
the

the

all
publisher
will

figure
out
how
to
make
a

in

or
they
could
be
sideswipe
by
these
rapidly
move
vehicle
of
change
most
likely
google
will
play
a
huge
role
in
the
transformation
of
these
industry
and
publisher
and
creator
will
have
to
follow
its
lead
their
best
bet
be
to
start
think
more
like
larry
and
sergey
they
need
to
create
economic
model
that
accept
a
certain
level
of
piracy
the
best
way
to
do
that
be
to
figure
out
how
to
serve
the
need
of
their
customer
rather
than
sue
them
to
keep
them
from

work
through
the

google
have
already
begin
experiment
with
and
track
the
value
of
free
distribution
as
a
marketing
tool
but
the
solution
to
these
problem
will
not
come
easily
and
many
of
the
answer
will
be
determine
in
court
often
with
google
as
a
defendant
it
be
likely
that
the
supreme
court
of
many
country
will
end
up
define
the
right
of
publisher
and
perhaps
redefine
the
scope
of
copyright
law
the
difference
be
that
larry
and
sergey
may
not
fight
as
hard
to
defend
their
view
they
re
become
less

albert

the

we
do

we
reserve

criticize

step
far
beyond
the

of

mission
in
an
attempt
to
take
over
the
entire

industry
in
fact
google
use
to
say
that
it
focus
on

but
let
its
engineer
and
computer
scientist
dabble
in
whatever
they
want
with
percent
of
their
time
now
the
company
say
that
percent
of
its
research

its

percent
be
dedicate
to

there
be
logic
behind
most
of
the
company
s
seemingly
scattershot
approach
to
diversification
put
at
the
top
of
the
list
because
they
can
larry
and
sergey
understand
the
internet
and
they
know
how
to
use
it
in
the
year
when

the
death
of

larry

understood
its

the

when
larry

built

to
handle

they
realize
it
could
do
so
much
more
that

be

big
to

google

such
a

match
the

it
allows

that
larry

afraid
of
this

on
the

if
larry

get
their

it
will
be
extraordinarily
difficult
for
traditional
business
to
compete
as
they
have
since
the
start
of
the

century
any
business
that
deal
in
the

danger

say
nothing

they

there
s
a

that
they

google
be
an
idea
machine
some
of
the
idea
come
from
the
top
larry
for
example
thought
of
the
idea
for
street
view
in
google
map
that
be
actual
photograph
of
the
street
and
building
to
help
people
identify
their

before
google
map
be
even
create
but
this
be
not
apple
and
larry
and
sergey
be
not
steve
job
the
company
be
not
centrally
control
and
idea
can
come
from
anywhere
the
problem
with
most
corporation
be
that
it
s
hard
to
get
people
to
think
differently
people
be
more
likely
to
think
incrementally
rather
than
boldly
many
tech
company
deal
with
this
problem
by
create
formalize
skunk
work
specialized
team
put
together
to
work
on
an
innovative
new
idea
at
google
everyone
be
a
skunk
google
s
innovation
machine
be
design
to
create
hundred
or
thousand
of
research
project
many
of
them
oneperson
team
that
s
the
idea
behind
the
concept
of
percent
time
which
allows
scientist
and
engineer
at
the
company
to
spend
up
to
one
day
a
week
work
on
their
own
idea
at
a
technology
entertainment
design
ted
conference
for
big
thinker
in
these
field
a
few
year
ago
larry
explain
how
it
come
about
both
sergey
and
i
go
to
montessori
school
for
some
reason
this
have
be
incorporate
into
google
we
ve
embody
this
as
the
percent
time
for
percent
of
your
time
you
can
do
what
you
think
be
important
to
do
after
all
mendel
discover
the
law
of
genetics
as
a
hobby
as
company
get
big
they
find
it
harder
to
have
small
innovative
project
we
have
that
problem
too
for
a
while
and
we
say
oh
we
really
need
a
new
concept
not
every
engineer
have
new
idea
to
pursue
and
not
everyone
take
that
time
some
may
join
up
with
other
people
s
project
some
may
use
the
time
to
take
class
some
may
formally
set
aside
one
day
per
week
for
a
project
while
others
may
occasionally
dabble
all
that
s
require
be
let
their
manager
know
what
they
want
to
do
we
re
flexible
say
senior
vice
president
alan
eustace
you
have
to
have
way
to
set
aside
the
time
when
you
need
to
otherwise
the
upstream
stuff
isn
t
go
to
happen
the
process
go
beyond
give
researcher
the
ability
to
take
time
off
from
their
regular
job
idea
be
share
discuss
analyze
and
criticize
to
make
that
happen
google
have
create
a
database
of
information
about
every
project
every
engineer
be
work
on
all
the
engineer
in
the
company
have
access
to
the
database
and
can
find
out
what
anyone
else
be
do
any
engineer
can
examine
the
design
document
of
any
project
add
comment
about
the
project
and
e
mail
member
of
team
to
offer
comment
and
opinion
they
can
even
rate
other
people
s
comment
in
engineering
everyone
be
a
critic
larry
and
sergey
create
that
system
to
prevent
idea
from
die
before
they
ever
get
past
the
concept
stage
where
most
company
fail
on
innovation
be
that
they
don
t
take
into
account
the
whole
pipeline
of
innovation
say
eustace
they
tend
to
have
a
suggestion
box
mentality
next
week
maybe
somebody
will
empty
the
box
you
can
t
really
get
feedback
on
your
idea
and
they
die
on
the
vine
we
have
a
lot
of
different
way
to
get
feedback
but
they
also
have
to
withstand
the
scrutiny
of
larry
and
sergey
if
they
think
it
have
commercial
potential
the
founder
decide
where
the
company
will
go
next
and
they
be
ruthless
judge
of
product
design
the
product
designer
and
engineer
schedule
meeting
with
sergey
and
larry
to
report
on
progress
and
the
pair
do
not
soft
pedal
their
critique
ceo
eric
schmidt
describes
them
as
brutal
tough
critic
although
schmidt
s
role
be
to
run
the
business
and
focus
on
grow
the
company
he
defers
to
larry
and
sergey
s
judgment
about
which
technology
and
product
will
get
them
there
but
it
s
not
always
a
harmonious
meeting
of
the
mind
there
be
time
when
larry
and
sergey
would
do
thing
i
be
very
unhappy
about
because
they
be
so
precocious
he
say
their
argument
be
often
heat
and
schmidt
decide
that
it
be
a
bad
idea
to
conduct
them
publicly
eventually
we
agree
that
we
would
have
an
argument
privately
he
say
the
argument
that
lead
to
the
private
meeting
come
a
few
year
ago
when
the
company
have
to
decide
which
browser
google
should
focus
on
when
design
product
microsoft
s
internet
explorer
have
the
overwhelm
market
share
but
technology
savvy
interneters
such
as
larry
and
sergey
favor
the
more
elegant
and
open
firefox
browser
from
mozilla
org
a
nonprofit
group
that
allows
the
geeky
public
to
design
new
feature
as
an
open
system
it
s
easy
for
outsider
to
create
add
on
program
that
user
can
choose
to
add
or
not
some
web
site
will
only
work
properly
and
fully
with
internet
explorer
a
meeting
be
schedule
to
include
larry
sergey
schmidt
and
google
engineer
to
make
the
decision
sergey
arrive
late
to
the
meeting
and
it
start
late
when
he
arrive
he
hat
the
approach
the
team
be
favor
sergey
throw
up
all
over
the
decision
in
front
of
everybody
recall
schmidt
i
say
stop
everyone
leave
the
room
i
sat
down
and
told
them
don
t
do
that
if
we
re
go
to
have
an
argument
let
s
have
it
in
private
in
that
meeting
schmidt
told
sergey
i
m
willing
to
do
what
you
want
although
i
don
t
agree
with
it
but
he
told
larry
and
sergey
they
have
to
come
to
an
agreement
on
the
issue
and
give
them
until
p
m
the
follow
day
to
do
so
then
he
left
the
room
to
let
them
fight
it
out
this
be
a
test
to
see
what
would
happen
say
schmidt
what
happen
be
not
what
he
expect
the
next
day
the
deadline
pass
with
no
answer
so
schmidt
go
to
larry
and
sergey
to
get
one
their
response
well
we
give
the
team
a
new
set
of
assignment
and
we
re
meeting
again
tomorrow
we
come
up
with
a
completely
new
approach
the
follow
day
after
feedback
from
the
engineer
larry
and
sergey
agree
on
the
new
approach
they
have
come
up
with
a
way
to
reengineer
the
development
process
so
that
the
program
would
work
with
any
browser
the
issue
be
now
moot
all
the
team
be
happy
and
i
learn
something
say
schmidt
i
didn
t
need
to
decide
the
answer
i
just
need
to
make
sure
all
the
ambiguity
be
expose
and
that
the
right
people
be
in
the
room
to
get
it
set
up
sometimes
there
s
a
well
answer
that
s
not
in
the
current
solution
set
have
we
stop
and
just
do
what
sergey
want
or
just
do
what
i
d
approve
we
would
not
have
gotten
to
the
well
algorithm
this
realization
be
a
real
mind
opener
to
schmidt
it
help
me
understand
my
role
he
say
now
i
try
not
to
make
important
decision
unless
they
re
really
important
one
rather
i
ve
try
to
make
the
culture
work
the
way
it
feel
to
me
be
they
be
smarter
quicker
more
opinionated
and
earlier
than
i
be
they
re
on
an
issue
earlier
than
i
be
my
job
be
to
make
sure
that
reality
and
what
we
re
do
match
together
for
a
positive
outcome
schmidt
still
operates
on
that
principle
today
at
the
time
i
met
with
him
in
november
he
have
just
come
from
another
debate
although
a
much
milder
one
this
time
with
larry
sergey
be
out
of
town
larry
have
long
believe
that
there
be
incredible
opportunity
for
create
application
for
mobile
phone
schmidt
be
ready
to
bag
that
market
for
a
while
so
he
met
with
larry
and
told
him
that
despite
all
the
application
google
and
others
have
built
for
cell
phone
there
s
not
anything
incredible
so
larry
point
out
one
such
application
and
told
schmidt
about
all
the
opportunity
it
represent
for
the
future
schmidt
be
impressed
with
his
think
and
schedule
a
meeting
for
the
follow
day
to
discus
the
potential
the
meeting
happen
because
larry
and
i
be
think
similarly
but
he
be
think
with
well
specificity
i
be
just
generally
complain
that
s
a
big
part
of
the
reason
that
the
number
of
service
google
offer
grows
constantly
although
management
insists
that
it
s
still
primarily
a
search
company
outsider
include
wall
street
analyst
see
what
appear
to
be
a
scattershot
diversification
there
be
however
specific
target
in
mind
larry
and
sergey
be
focus
on
all
the
possibility
of
the
internet
and
many
others
besides
many
of
their
effort
be
design
to
fill
in
space
they
feel
be
not
be
fill
properly
and
they
re
very
fond
of
show
others
what
they
believe
be
the
right
approach
say
stanford
president
and
google
board
member
john
hennessy
larry
and
sergey
have
very
broad
and
eclectic
interest
those
interest
be
especially
strong
when
it
come
to
get
people
online
so
they
can
use
google
s
service
and
come
up
with
new
way
to
gather
information
for
people
to
search
through
from
e
mail
to
news
to
people
s
own
document
the
medium
biz
increasingly
google
be
look
like
a
medium
company
in
it
paid
billion
to
buy
youtube
the
world
s
lead
supplier
of
online
video
people
post
homemade
video
piece
of
television
program
tv
commercial
and
anything
else
that
strike
their
fancy
but
that
s
the
key
difference
between
google
and
a
traditional
medium
company
google
do
not
create
its
own
video
content
it
merely
provide
the
mean
for
others
to
create
content
and
distribute
it
through
google
s
service
it
s
another
effort
to
build
the
world
s
great
online
library
nevertheless
youtube
have
gotten
google
into
a
cauldron
of
trouble
soon
after
google
bought
youtube
in
viacom
file
a
billion
lawsuit
against
youtube
and
google
for
allow
user
to
post
copyright
protect
video
on
the
site
that
suit
be
still
crawl
through
the
court
in
october
viacom
issue
a
statement
that
say
essentially
if
google
can
settle
with
book
publisher
it
can
do
the
same
with
hollywood
copyright
law
provide
creator
with
the
incentive
to
create
the
work
consumer
crave
say
the
statement
it
be
unfortunate
that
the
publisher
have
to
spend
year
and
million
of
dollar
for
google
to
honor
that
principle
we
hope
that
google
avoids
the
waste
effort
and
come
more
quickly
to
respect
movie
and
television
program
these
day
such
video
regularly
disappear
as
soon
as
they
re
post
as
google
complies
with
demand
from
the
program
producer
but
just
as
quickly
they
reappear
post
by
someone
else
it
s
an
ongoing
battle
in
which
larry
and
sergey
firmly
believe
they
be
protect
by
the
digital
millennium
copyright
act
of
which
say
that
internet
service
provider
isps
be
not
liable
for
illegal
posting
by
others
use
their
service
as
long
as
the
operator
remove
infringe
content
and
do
not
induce
user
to
upload
those
posting
so
why
get
involve
in
video
distribution
in
the
first
place
there
be
two
reason
for
one
it
s
a
huge
business
that
promise
to
give
google
more
place
to
park
ad
the
other
be
that
it
really
do
affect
google
s
ability
to
improve
search
google
do
not
have
access
to
all
the
world
s
information
yet
just
as
they
want
to
digitize
book
so
people
can
search
through
them
larry
and
sergey
want
to
ensure
that
there
be
a
large
pool
of
video
content
to
search
through
too
that
be
not
an
easy
task
the
future
of
search
be
much
more
complex
more
three
dimensional
it
involves
the
ability
to
search
through
image
sound
music
time
and
space
google
be
experiment
with
way
to
parse
any
type
of
information
so
that
it
can
be
recognize
and
found
the
easy
approach
search
through
the
label
apply
to
picture
and
sound
be
extremely
limited
google
need
to
be
able
to
capture
word
recognize
their
meaning
and
put
them
into
the
search
index
this
be
also
the
reason
google
bought
picasa
a
picturesharing
site
that
also
allows
people
to
edit
and
manipulate
their
photo
its
research
be
still
secret
but
many
other
researcher
be
experiment
with
technique
to
automatically
search
for
and
identify
photograph
at
stanford
researcher
have
be
try
to
identify
the
content
of
photograph
by
recognize
whether
they
include
face
or
the
blue
sky
and
green
grass
of
landscape
today
s
camera
also
capture
the
date
and
time
that
image
be
take
and
one
day
it
may
even
be
possible
to
use
global
position
satellite
to
determine
where
a
picture
be
take
through
picasa
google
will
have
access
to
that
data
it
s
also
very
important
that
google
can
observe
how
people
use
different
type
of
information
everything
someone
post
online
say
something
about
him
his
interest
opinion
like
and
dislike
by
integrate
people
s
data
from
many
different
source
google
s
computer
collect
what
s
know
as
metadata
a
powerful
tool
for
improve
its
product
and
presence
on
the
internet
the
pc
biz
metadata
can
come
from
almost
anywhere
while
they
re
at
it
how
about
add
everyone
s
personal
content
to
the
internet
this
mean
e
mail
spreadsheet
document
and
other
product
of
individual
creativity
the
goal
be
primarily
to
make
each
individual
s
information
available
to
her
to
keep
it
from
unwanted
pry
eye
and
ear
but
also
to
share
it
if
she
wish
every
piece
of
data
say
something
about
the
individual
use
it
allow
google
to
far
customize
search
to
that
individual
s
need
and
if
people
be
use
google
product
to
create
that
information
it
s
easy
for
the
company
to
analyze
it
categorize
it
and
add
it
to
the
ream
of
metadata
it
have
access
to
when
people
use
google
s
application
program
such
as
google
doc
the
company
have
free
access
to
the
information
although
it

technology
company
of

microsoft
see
google
as
an
infiltrator
into
its

business

be
try

respond
in

the
two
company
have
start
an

around
each

so

google

it

enter
microsoft

business
in

counterattack
redmond
s
foray

there
be
some

all

it
s
not
in

not
that
we

i
don

think
people
at

would
ever
see
this
as

it
s
a

there

the

crack

show

at

this

the

the

it

it

both
for

clearly
the

not
there

degree
of

we
will
work
on

for
tolerate
a
string
of
failure
most
good
company
in
silicon
valley
know
that
you
cannot
innovate
without
be
willing
to
make
mistake
and
people
tend
to
forget
that
bill
gate
built
an
empire
on
me
too
product
most
of
which
seem
like
failure
for
year
until
the
company
get
it
right
even
microsoft
s
operating
system
be
a
derivative
of
one
create
by
another
company
which
microsoft
license
from
it
many
of
the
major
software
application
microsoft
create
be
base
on
product
invent
elsewhere
and
like
microsoft
google
be
wealthy
enough
to
spend
the
money
on
experimentation
a
more
substantive
criticism
may
be
that
larry
and
sergey
have
a
tendency
to
believe
that
they
can
do
a
well
job
than
any
competitor
create
many
thing
that
they
could
just
as
well
buy
google
s
supernetwork
be
an
example
although
it
s
built
with
off
the
shelf
pc
their
design
be
modify
for
efficiency
as
be
the
network
connect
them
but
do
google
really
need
to
invent
everything
anew
one
thing
larry
and
sergey
have
trouble
with
be
figure
out
how
to
complete
a
product
their
computer
scientist
approach
be
to
release
product
before
they
re
perfect
use
the
internet
to
collect
opinion
from
million
of
user
to
tweak
the
design
in
general
it
s
a
brilliant
approach
something
that
could
not
be
do
as
efficiently
before
the
internet
and
it
s
a
huge
contrast
to
microsoft
which
creates
its
product
behind
close
laboratory
door
and
release
product
that
be
too
complicate
for
most
people
to
fully
exploit
bill
gate
have
admit
that
this
end
up
be
the
case
because
microsoft
relies
on
expert
mainly
product
reviewer
to
design
product
every
product
reviewer
make
a
list
of
feature
that
a
product
should
have
and
creates
table
check
off
the
item
on
the
list
and
compare
which
product
have
the
most
check
mark
and
every
reviewer
have
a
different
list
google
s
product
invariably
start
off
with
lousy
review
because
of
everything
they
lack
compare
with
the
competition
but
the
company
carefully
add
feature
that
be
really
need
by
most
user
and
end
up
with
a
clean
easy
to
use
product
if
not
the
most
versatile
the
gmail
program
for
example
be
pan
by
a
lot
of
reviewer
when
it
first
come
out
it
s
now
widely
respect
for
its
simplicity
and
dependence
on
google
s
search
capability
which
rely
on
search
for
name
or
word
in
a
long
list
of
e
mail
rather
than
require
user
to
organize
everything
into
category
to
make
them
easy
to
find
the
difficulty
with
release
a
product
in
beta
form
before
it
s
finish
be
that
a
product
be
never
really
finish
most
software
developer
just
get
as
far
as
they
can
under
the
deadline
they
re
give
then
extend
the
deadline
before
release
the
product
to
the
public
in
order
to
get
in
other
feature
they
feel
certain
be
necessary
at
google
some
product
never
seem
to
come
out
of
beta
gmail
for
example
have
be
on
the
market
for
five
year
and
be
still
list
as
a
beta
product
google
have
never
explain
why
this
be
the
case
it
s
become
something
of
a
joke
in
the
industry
say
board
member
hennessy
sergey
be
frustrate
with
the
fact
that
even
when
a
product
be
ninety
percent
there
it
s
still
in
beta
it
s
hard
to
figure
out
how
to
get
it
to
where
you
want
it
to
be
but
he
add
that
make
that
decision
be
a
problem
at
every
innovative
company
google
be
just
more
public
about
it
and
overall
he
s
extremely
impressed
with
the
company
and
its
product
google
s
execution
certainly
since
the
ipo
have
be
as
good
or
well
than
any
company
i
ve
ever
see
he
say
it
s
driven
by
analysis
and
the
approach
of
get
all
the
data
in
front
of
you
so
you
don
t
spend
as
much
time
to
make
a
decision
be
this
a
big
issue
or
a
small
issue
be
there
a
quick
fix
or
be
this
a

that
kind
of

go
on
a
fair
amount
by
tap
the
power
of
technology
and
imagination
larry
and
sergey
have
start
morph
google
into
a
new
kind
of
company
one
more
diversified
perhaps
less
focus
certainly
more
ambitious
but
this
be
also
dangerous
territory
technological
landscape
in
which
they
have
neither

nor
a
head
start
sometimes
they
wield

it
s
not
the
best
way
to
win
friend
this
time
google

move
into
new

in

be
to
start
offering

after
all
it
would
be
a
great

consider
opening

in
a
city
ensure
that
worker
could
get

even
when
out
of
the

sacca
decide
to
see
if
he
could
kick
start
the
idea
it
start
with
just
me
like
most
thing
at
google
you
just
start
it
and
don
t
ask
for
permission
sacca
saw
the
resistance
from
isps
as
a
dangerous
trend
there
be
a
lot
of
saber
rattle
from
the

we
have
a
layer
between
us
and
our

it
scar
me
and
concerned
me
we
spent
time
think
about
how
do
we
respond
to
this
policy
sure
but
we
be
still
young
in
d
c
since
san
francisco
mayor
gavin
newsom
be
good
friend
with
larry
and
sergey
and
a
big
fan
of
google
he
seem
like
a
good
place
to
start
sacca
talk
with
the

in
the

get
his
approval
google
offer
to
install
the

transceivers
and
operate
the

for
free
although
it
would
cost
google
million
to
million
to
install
it
who
could
turn
it
down
san

could
as
it
turn
out
google
announce
that
it
be
planning
to
start
the

and
immediately
other
telecommunication
company
complain
why
couldn
t
they
bid
to
install
the
system
perhaps
they
could
offer
a
well
deal
such
as
a
service
that
do
not
include
any
advertising
so
the
san
francisco
board
of
supervisor
decide
to
put
it
up
for
a

several
telco

up
with

assign
the

review
the

the
result
of
the

be
not
surprising
the
google
earthlink
bid
be
zero
dollar
and
the
board
of
supervisor
announce
that
the
team
have
won
but
even
a
free
system
be
not
good
enough
for
some
supervisor
two
of
them
chris
daly

jake
mcgoldrick
begin
ask
why
google

francisco
citizen
who
would
have
to
look
at

when

besides
google
would
have
to
install
the

on

light
pole
shouldn
t
it
pay
rent
for
the
privilege
they
begin
to
make
more
demand
google
come
back
and
sweeten
the
offer
it
would
pay
the
city
million
over
the
first
few
year
of
the
contract
supervisor
mcgoldrick
complain
that
this
be
not
enough
after
all
google
have
a
profit
of
hundred
of
million
of

a
year
it
could
afford

more
other

stop
its

we
thought
we
have
a
lot
of
smart
wireless
engineer
here
what
if
we
built
one
of
these
wireless
network
to
see
if
it
work
say
sacca
incumbent
be
say
it
would
never
work
entrepreneur
be
claim
it
could
do
everything
i
thought
we
could
buy
the
equipment
hang
it
up
and
see
if
it
work
finally
sacca
decide
to
meet
with
supervisor
chris
daly
to
argue
for
the
system
there
be
poor
neighborhood
in
san
francisco
where
people
have
no
internet
access
some
of
them
in
supervisor
daly
s
constituency
this
would
be
big
political
capital
for
him
sacca
argue
google
would
be
sure
to
give
him
credit
for
make
the
system
happen
but
there
be
another
stick
point
political
rivalry
daly
be
one
of
the
supervisor
constantly
at
war
with
mayor
newsom
sacca
say
daly
flatly
refuse
to
back
the
initiative
and
end
the
meeting
by
say
now
this
be
where
you
just
get
the
hell
out
of
my
office
add
sacca
it
be
fascinate
and
dishearten
i
be
so
upset
i
just
fume
in
the
lobby
i
didn
t
want
to
leave
the
building
san
francisco
still
do
not
have
a
citywide
wifi
system
although
mayor
newsom
have
manage
to
install
small
wifi
network
at
city
housing
project
under
a
grant
from
at
t
in
the
meantime
while
this
controversy
be
rag
in
san
francisco
google
get
a
similar
proposal
to
fly
through
the
government
regulator
in
its
own
town
mountain
view
that
system
have
now
be
up
and
run
for
over
a
year
and
google
say
the
interference
concern
have
not
pan
out
the
experience
in
mountain
view
be
really
fulfil
say
sacca
we
do
community
meeting
entirely
in
spanish
to
promote
the
idea
the
usage
be
concentrate
most
heavily
in
the
poorest
part
of
the
town
include
some
hispanic
neighborhood
for
some
of
these
people
it
be
their
lifeline
google
still
want
to
see
more
wifi
across
the
world
it
fund
and
help
launch
a
company
call
meraki
network
which
make
wireless
transceivers
that
people
can
buy
not
only
to
create
a
wireless
connection
for
themselves
but
also
to
offer
their
wifi
connection
to
others
some
do
it
for
free
but
others
can
charge
for
the
access
use
an
online
billing
system
provide
and
run
by
meraki
the
system
be
gain
popularity
in
san
francisco
but
google
never
saw
this
as
a
new
business
opportunity
it
be
mainly
interested
in
the
catalyst
role
get
local
municipality
to
start
think
about
the
possibility
the
goal
wasn
t
to
build
wifi
in
every
town
say
sacca
just
one
or
two
hopefully
cut
them
some
air
act
as
a
catalyst
and
this
do
happen
many
city
start
instal
municipal
wifi
system
include
philadelphia
new
orleans
houston
chicago
atlanta
portland
and
boston
in
many
of
these
city
exist
isps
sue
to
keep
it
from
happen
after
verizon
communication
and
other
isps
lobby
the
pennsylvania
state
legislature
it
pass
a
law
forbid
any
city
in
that
state
to
build
any
wifi
network
without
give
the
private
sector
first
crack
at
it
the
idea
of
free
wifi
as
propose
by
google
be
now
effectively
dead
it
s
be
hard
for
company
to
create
an
effective
advertising
model
that
would
support
free
wifi
if
anybody
could
have
do
so
it
would
have
be
google
but
the
company
say
it
s
through
with
experiment
with
the
concept
earthlink
one
of
the
company
try
to
make
a
business
out
of
municipal
wifi
be
face
financial
trouble
and
have
decide
to
get
out
of
the
municipal
wifi
business
as
a
result
philadelphia
be
shut
down
its
earthlink
base
wifi
system
and
others
be
follow
that
lead
perhaps
it
be
a
bad
idea
to
begin
with
the
old
wifi
technology
that
s
be
use
so
far
be
inadequate
since
the
signal
cannot
pas
through
wall
or
other
obstruction
in
city
craig
settle
a
municipal
wifi
consultant
at
successful
com
believe
google
do
a
disservice
to
the
concept
by
lead
city
to
believe
they
could
get
wifi
for
free
in
retrospect
sacca
believe
he
offer
too
much
up
front
he
should
have
first
offer
to
install
the
system
for
a
few
million
dollar
then
negotiate
down
mayor
gavin
newsom
believe
that
everything
fell
apart
because
the
city
didn
t
simply
jump
on
google
s
offer
immediately
and
instead
let
too
many
other
company
get
involve
if
we
have
just
work
with
google
it
would
have
happen
he
say
google
be
get
well
at
the
political
game
and
it
still
have
a
chance
to
make
change
happen
there
be
new
alternative
on
the
rise
one
be
the
white
space
between
broadcast
tv
channel
frequency
buffer
zone
create
to
keep
one
channel
s
signal
from
interfere
with
the
one
next
to
it
as
broadcast
tv
go
digital
the
fcc
have
decide
to
open
up
the
frequency
for
other
us
include
wifi
these
signal
can
pas
through
wall
it
be
controversial
with
broadcaster
and
entertainer
lobbying
against
it
say
there
would
still
be
interference
and
google
and
others
lobbying
for
it
this
be
one
of
larry
s
pet
project
after
test
the
fcc
have
decide
that
interference
won
t
be
a
problem
and
it
approve
its
use
larry
couldn
t
help
get
in
a
dig
at
his
opponent
in
a
post
on
the
company
s
blog
as
an
engineer
i
be
also
really
gratify
to
see
that
the
fcc
decide
to
put
science
over
politics
he
write
for
year
the
broadcasting
lobby
and
others
have
try
to
spread
fear
and
confusion
about
this
technology
rather
than
allow
the
fcc
s
engineer
to
simply
do
their
work
another
be
a
proposal
by
the
fcc
to
auction
off
a
mhz
swath
of
spectrum
in
the
mhz
band
with
the
requirement
that
the
win
bidder
use
some
of
it
to
offer
free
wifi
across
the
country
even
settle
believe
this
proposal
could
work
google
have
not
give
any
indication
of
how
it
might
participate
in
these
new
proposal
but
give
its
vested
interest
in
get
more
people
online
cheaply
and
without
restriction
it
s
highly
likely
that
it
will
participate
in
some
way
the
move
and
lobbying
google
have
already
do
will
ultimately
lead
to
more
internet
access
say
sacca
and
as
he
note
google
have
staggeringly
high
resource
to
be
apply
to
the
world
s
big
problem
google
may
yet
look
more
like
a
telecommunication
company
in
the
future
and
once
again
people
will
scratch
their
head
and
wonder
why
larry
and
sergey
want
to
get
involve
in
something
so
far
remove
from
the
search
business
chapter
think
beyond
search
the

real
and
fanciful
the

for
himself
when
he
be
very
young
make
a
fortune
as
an
entrepreneur
first
then
become
a
philanthropist
he
be
true
to
his
word
the
difference
with
larry
and
sergey
say
brilliant
be
that
they
re
dedicate
to
make
google
the
core
of
philanthropic
work
at
such
a
young
age
when
you
re
old
and
you
ve
lose
somebody
when
you
ve
be
touch
with
mortality
have
a
birth
or
a
near
death
see
the
futility
of
material
thing
you
will
wax
philosophic
about
the
meaning
of
life
and
duty
and
make
the
morally
right
decision
say
brilliant
but
in
young
people
my
experience
have
be
that
that
s
rare
that
s
what
be
so
impressive
about
larry
and
sergey
i
be
double
their
age
and
they
have
thought
more
deeply
about
some
of
the
moral
issue
of
technology
and
business
than
i
have
brilliant
have
have
a
strong
influence
on
the
organization
larry
and
sergey
be
deeply
interested
in
his
background
deal
with
disease
after
three
week
on
the
job
larry
come
to
his
office
and
say
they
should
think
about
health
they
spent
a
year
go
through
thousand
of
different
proposal
that
have
be
submit
to
them
from
deal
with
water
crisis
to
the

brilliant
make
his
ted

one
of
its
initiative
be
development
of
a

to
use
the
power
of
information
technology
to
create
a
proactive
system
that
can
predict
and
help
prevent
infectious
disease
rather
than
just
react

them
once
they

it
have
as
its
mission
to
inform
the
population
of
develop
country
of
service
available
to
them
from
their
own
government
too
frequently
people
don
t
even
know
what
program
they
might
be
able
to
tap
and
the
program
be
design
to
empower
them
to
demand
those
service
range
from
education
to
improve
water
quality
to
find
a
doctor
sometimes
the
government
themselves
be
not
aware
that
the
service
they
re
pay
for
be
not
actually
be
provide
that
program
also
fund
nonprofit

act
as
scorekeeper
to
track
who
s
get
school
or
physician
in
their
area
brilliant
say
this
program
can
even
empower
the
government
to
provide
new
service
some
country
be
post
soviet
and
many
country
in
africa
be
post
conflict
and
these
be
not
necessarily
government
that
have
a
long
tradition
of
deliver
complex
service
to
huge
number
of
people
so
we
can
help
with
tool
with
computer
system
and
then
we
can
help
empower
community
to
know
which
of
these
thing
be
important
that
s
a
really
great
initiative
with
google
s
core
principle
he
say
but
larry
and
sergey
be
still
the
go
to
people
for
approval
they
like
to
analyze
the
program
and
look
for
practical
way
to
implement
them
and
measure
progress
when
brilliant
present
the
proposal
for
the
inform
and
empower
program
to
larry
and
sergey
he
come
arm
with
several
objective
to
improve
the
ability
of
government
to
render
service
to
improve
the
ability
of
people
to
find
out
about
those
service
and
to
get
a
scorekeeper
larry
and
sergey
discuss
this
and
point
out
that
the
important
issue
isn
t
whether
the
government
or
an
ngo
be
keep
score
the
important
thing
be
the
result
so
they
say
each
program
should
also
set
a
goal
that
percent
of
the
people
affected
should
know
the
quality
of
the
water
they
drink
the
quality
of
education
their
kid
get
and
the
quality
of
the
health
care
they
receive
their
think
go
immediately
above
the
tactic
to
the
result
say
brilliant
that
s
the
way
they
think
they
go
to
the
high
level
and
they
externalize
it
brilliant
who
be
well
read
than
most
journalist
interview
him
compare
larry
and
sergey
s
think
to
that
of
immanuel
kant
when
he
write
philosophical
argument
about
what
action
constitute
the
great
good
in
the
world
kant
described
the
categorical
imperative
which
suggests
choose
the
good
work
you
do
by
ask
yourself
what
if
everybody
get
this
good
thing
say
brilliant
the
idea
be
to
look
to
the
universality
of
the
good
that
s
the
way
larry
and
sergey
think
their
mind
be
in
a
different
paradigm
another
favorite
obsession
larry
and
sergey
share
be
deal
with
climate
change
they
have
start
initiative
to
explore
those
problem
before
brilliant
arrive
larry
be
the
one
who
be
particularly
interested
in
this
issue
in
he
give
a
talk
at
the
annual
meeting
of
the
american
association
for
the
advancement
of
science
aaa
in
which
he
argue
that
the
scientist
should
make
it
a
point
to
look
for
solution
to
global
warm
and
to
make
sure
the
public
know
about
them
he
then
decide
to
show
them
how
to
do
it
this

it

some
of

one
of
the

on
a

scale
to
say
the

it
s
an
unusual
task
for

to
tackle
but
that
s
larry
for
you
in
a
blog
post
he
explain
the
reason
he
felt
it
be
something
google
should
take
on
our
new

isn
t
just
about

we

at
which
clean

so
they
can
rival

intensive

by
building

that
lead
the

we
want
to
apply
the

creativity

innovation
to
the
challenge
of
generate
inexpensive
renewable
electricity
at

by
combine
talented
technologist
great
partner
and
large

we
have
an
opportunity

quickly
push
this
technology
forward
the
philosophy
be
hybrid
philanthropy
with
google
both
funding
others
and
try
to
develop
the
technology
itself
it
s
not
a
tangent
insists
brilliant
the
independent
charge
to

be
to
try
to
address
some
of
the
great
problem
by
use
the
fortune
google
have
and
this
be
one
of
the
gravest
crisis
how
could
we
do
less
if
all
we
do
be
give
money
we
would
be
fall
short
of
hybrid
philanthropy
for
the
people
who
say
it
doesn
t
make

i
would
point
out
that
we
do

of
hardware

at

so
far
it
hasn
t
happen
there
have
even
be
rumor
that
google
be
interested
in
buying
sprint
and
really
get
into
the
cell
phone
business
everyone
like
to
speculate
but
there
s
no
tell
where
larry
and
sergey
will
take
their
company
next
there
s
one
thing
that
s
certain
they
be
go
to
be
break
rule
piss
people
off
and
try
to
make
the
world
a
well
place
for
decade
to
come
love
them
or
despise
them
everyone
must
contend
with
them
they
be
have
great
impact
on
the
business
world
and
on
people
s
lifestyle
than
any
other
business
executive
in
the
world
their
heart
be
in
the
right
place
even
if
their
head
be
sometimes
not
but
then
larry
and
sergey
have
always
be
difficult
to
figure
out
venture
capitalist
mike
speiser
will
attest
to
that
in
early
when
speiser
be
still
an
entrepreneur
at
online
rating
site
epinions
he
met
larry
at
a
social
gathering
for
entrepreneur
call
round
zero
the
conversation
turn
to
politics
and
he
be
take
aback
by
larry
s
attitude
i
m
all
for
question
the
current
orthodoxy
say
speiser
but
larry
effortlessly
ignore
all
of
the
law
and
custom
of
the
day
i
remember
think
that
silicon
valley
be
load
with
self
proclaim
libertarian
but
this
guy
be
an
anarchist
larry
be
so
unusual
in
fact
that
he
make
speiser
uncomfortable
at
the
time
speiser
have
difficulty
see
google
succeed
with
larry
as
one
of
the
company
s
top
leader
but
he
have
since
come
to
appreciate
that
much
of
google
s
success
be
likely
a
result
of
larry
s
lack
of
respect
for
authority
my
parent
taught
me
that
many
of
the
great
scientist
throughout
time
succeed
because
they
ignore
conventional
wisdom
and
follow
their
own
instinct
i
now
realize
that
entrepreneurship
be
no
different
the
people
who
break
the
current
orthodoxy
make
others
uncomfortable
and
they
be
also
the
one
who
change
the
world
with
google
and
their
sudden
wealth
at
their
disposal
larry
and
sergey
now
have
enormous
power
to
make
those
change
and
they
will
continue
to
do
so
for
decade
to
come
they
re
like
harry
potter
after
he
discover
he
be
a
wizard
and
get
his
wand
you
can
expect
great
thing
from
them
