prologue

up
in
the
old
cemetery
walk
among
ghost
the
ambiance
of
history
a
fine
specimen
of
manhood
geography
and
fate
portentous
sign
hard
slog
the
great
migration
the
first
people
the
men
in
the
white
robe
human
narrative
melancholic
beauty
forever
in
flame
time
take
me
by
the
hand
i
can
t
recall
the
moment
when
i
first
understood
that
i
be
on
this
earth
i
do
remember
though
when
i
first
realize
where
i
live
the
place
i
have
now
live
most
of
my
life
and
where
i
fully
expect
to
be
bury
it
be
dark
no
one
seem
to
be
around
which
do
not
necessarily
mean
it
be
late
since
it
have
long
be
my
experience
that
no
matter
where
you
roam
in
the
province
of
nova
scotia
it
be
usually
mostly
empty
what
be
i
do
out
there
on
the
loose
at
the
age
of
six
or
seven
everything
and
everyone
i
knew
friend
school
the
field
where
i
played
and
the
church
where
i
worship
be
bound
up
in
a
few
city
block
in
halifax
the
provincial
capital
my
parent
be
as
on
the
case
as
any
but
parent
be
parent
in
those
be
back
when
the
street
light
go
on
day
it
be
possible
that
i
be
like
a
puppy
that
have
crept
tentatively
outside
when
somebody
left
the
door
open
i
really
cannot
say
i
just
know
that
it
thrill
me
to
think
about
this
burst
of
freedom
all
these
year
later
so
i
must
have
felt
much
the
same
way
then
cross
a
wide
avenue
that
be
say
to
run
halfway
to
the
border
of
new
brunswick
the
next
province
west
i
would
have
be
move
quickly
for
that
be
how
i
do
everything
in
those
day
the
air
be
sultry
if
fog
be
come
it
be
still
a
way
off
but
the
street
light
house
and
occasional
car
all
have
a
magnify
brightness
sound
the
rustle
of
tree
the
buzz
of
an
electrical
transformer
expand
to
fill
the
air
time
which
for
me
at
that
age
unspooled
at
a
languid
pace
have
slow
to
a
crawl
as
it
do
when
something
special
be
happen
wind
rock
the
chain
on
the
gate
to
the
camp
hill
cemetery
although
that
could
have
just
be
my
sens
vibrate
for
i
be
and
remain
a
believer
in
thing
unseen
and
entity
and
eminence
float
in
the
air
story
just
drift
into
my
head
then
as
they
do
to
any
kid
with
a
fanciful
mind
you
saw
something
and
you
impose
a
narrative
not
because
you
felt
it
be
fantasy
but
because
you
thought
that
it
must
be
true
i
have
no
inkling
then
that
people
who
have
do
thing
lay
bury
there
privateer
soldier
and
merchant
enemy
of
confederation
and
near
prime
minister
folk
who
at
one
point
start
bank
and
brewery
shipping
empire
the
modern
day
oil
business
and
other
necessity
of
life
heroic
figure
who
because
of
a
moment
s
action
live
on
long
after
they
have
fed
the
worm
and
figure
whose
shameful
deed
meant
their
name
too
would
endure
herald
the
work
life
that
would
follow
i
just
walk
right
up
to
the
wrought
iron
fence
and
peer
in
i
try
to
be
quiet
since
people
seem
to
be
breathing
in
there
it
would
be
another
fifteen
year
before
i
attend
my
first
funeral
so
it
be
possible
that
by
then
i
d
never
actually
be
inside
a
cemetery
and
therefore
could
have
be
in
search
of
spirit
i
be
look
for
something
i
do
know
that
from
where
i
stood
i
would
have
see
obelisk
and
squat
gravestone
that
if
i
d
be
inside
the
gate
and
could
have
walk
right
up
to
them
i
would
have
note
be
cover
in
lichen
and
the
grime
of
time
the
inscription
so
worn
away
as
to
be
indecipherable
it
be
possible
that
i
heard
voice
from
the
bloody
scalpings
and
the
terrible
explosion
from
the
mass
troop
and
warship
from
the
sir
and
lady
carry
through
the
muddy
street
in
gild
carriage
from
the
strut
pirate
and
the
unfortunate
who
arrive
here
from
the
highland
the
slum
of
london
and
the
torched
loyalist
settlement
of
the
thirteen
colony
rise
like
a
collective
moan
but
i
think
i
would
have
remember
what
i
do
certainly
recollect
be
a
pleasurable
feel
that
half
a
century
later
i
recognize
as
the
ache
of
nostalgia
even
though
at
such
an
age
i
have
nothing
to
be
really
nostalgic
about
the
sensation
cannot
have
last
long
there
be
a
noise
i
turn
i
m
sure
without
look
and
hightail
it
run
as
fast
as
i
could
stay
under
the
street
light
all
the
way
home
which
be
really
only
two
city
block
but
seem
like
so
much
farther
i
have
no
inkling
of
what
happen
next
whether
my
absenteeism
have
repercussion
or
whether
i
just
slip
back
into
bed
without
anyone
notice
that
i
d
go
awol
i
cannot
rightly
say
as
i
recount
it
now
it
all
sound
like
a
dream
doesn
t
it
and
i
would
have
consider
that
maybe
i
make
the
whole
thing
up
except
for
the
desire
to
return
to
some
hazy
previous
time
i
remember
it
still
it
s
really
never
left

i
be
born
in
the
spring
of
in
a
hospital
a
few
block
from
where
i
wander
that
night
but
gene
have
memory
so
nova
scotia
and
i
go
way
back
my
people
be
come
from
aways
unless
your
vein
carry
mi
kmaq
blood
that
s
true
of
everybody
in
this
province
we
have
be
strive
folk
from
the
start
work
in
the
mill
and
mine
go
to
war
leave
the
countryside
for
job
that
kept
our
face
clean
in
the
glitter
mecca
of
halifax
vamoose
without
a
backward
glance
to
part
unknown
sometimes
just
stay
put
i
ve
do
my
best
to
shake
nova
scotia
i
ve
live
in
ottawa
twice
and
in
toronto
and
calgary
but
the
tidal
pull
of
the
place
have
always
be
deep
and
emotional
beyond
logic
once
my
wife
and
i
be
this
close
to
head
somewhere
exotic
and
far
away
then
good
job
open
up
in
halifax
and
that
be
that
because
for
well
or
bad
it
seem
i
will
have
no
other
place
like
most
kid
who
grow
up
here
what
i
first
learn
about
nova
scotia
i
learn
in
a
classroom
seat
at
a
little
wooden
desk
with
iron
leg
and
a
top
that
lift
open
reveal
the
scribbler
pencil
ruler
scissors
and
rubber
stopper
glue
bottle
store
inside
my
memory
be
that
the
cover
of
the
history
text
then
use
in
nova
scotia
s
elementary
school
be
adorn
with
the
province
s
coat
of
arm
which
along
with
reminder
of
its
scottish
root
feature
a
mi
kmaq
man
a
mythical
unicorn
and
a
bare
arm
and
laurel
sprig
meant
to
represent
the
conquest
of
hardship
to
be
met
here
i
must
have
like
what
i
read
in
there
because
it
stuck
with
me
new
information
get
add
in
the
formative
year
that
follow
even
though
i
wasn
t
much
of
a
reader
as
a
kid
but
i
watch
our
two
channel
of
canadian
television
i
d
hear
some
folk
song
or
some
old
relative
talk
history
really
just
seem
to
be
in
the
ether
in
this
place
where
ambiance
be
everywhere
the
fog
the
air
the
silence
the
building
that
seem
to
hide
more
than
they
reveal
the
broody
nature
of
the
people
myself
include
there
be
something
else
too
if
you
paid
attention
the
past
be
here
and
now
in
this
province
where
it
retain
a
power
over
human
life
and
destiny
unlike
in
other
place
i
ve
live
and
get
to
know
look
at
time
in
a
linear
a
to
b
fashion
didn
t
even
make
sense
here
a
place
where
once
upon
a
time
and
the
present
be
so
intertwine
that
they
seem
inseparable
exist
in
some
new
dimension
this
book
begin
as
an
attempt
make
something
of
that
old
feel
of
walk
among
ghost
of
be
haunt
by
history
that
take
place
before
i
be
even
born
and
be
transplant
back
endlessly
into
a
past
that
may
or
may
not
have
exist
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
what
i
think
i
know
about
this
place
and
how
i
feel
about
it
to
understand
i
suppose
how
nova
scotia
somehow
finally
become
nova
scotia
and
by
extension
how
i
become
me
it
be
by
and
large
a
sweet
idea
because
for
a
long
long
time
writer
have
be
ramble
around
this
province
and
make
note
about
what
they
think
and
see
who
they
meet
and
whatever
adventure
befall
them
one
of
them
be
bury
up
in
the
old
cemetery
on
the
southern
side
under
the
shade
of
a
hydrangea
tree
joseph
howe
be
just
twenty
three
at
the
moment
i
have
in
mind
which
may
sound
young
to
own
a
newspaper
but
not
if
you
have
already
be
in
the
business
for
a
decade
if
you
be
already
a
poet
of
sort
and
knew
the
trade
of
the
printer
as
well
as
that
of
the
post
office
clerk
not
if
with
a
partner
you
have
already
bought
one
paper
and
dispose
of
that
recently
become
the
editor
and
sole
proprietor
of
a
weekly
broadsheet
call
the
novascotian
howe
s
trio
of
half
brother
from
his
father
s
first
marriage
be
say
to
be
fine
specimen
of
manhood
tall
well
built
splendid
in
appearance
howe
be
not
there
s
a
photograph
of
him
from
what
i
assume
to
be
the
day
when
he
be
a
spent
force
he
sits
slump
supine
in
his
chair
his
hair
which
one
historian
described
as
stand
straight
up
as
if
electrify
by
the
energy
within
be
as
tangle
as
his
eyebrow
his
head
as
disproportionately
large
as
an
easter
island
statue
seem
to
sit
directly
atop
his
shoulder
yet
it
be
say
of
an
earlier
point
in
howe
s
life
that
when
his
face
glowed
with
the
inspiration
that
burning
thought
and
word
impart
and
his
great
deep
chest
swell
and
broaden
he
look
positively
nobly
and
kingly
that
be
the
man
i
choose
to
picture
set
out
in
along
one
of
nova
scotia
s
two
great
road
which
only
meant
that
they
be
sturdy
enough
to
carry
stagecoach
drawn
by
four
horse
such
as
the
one
in
which
howe
rode
he
be
even
then
a
man
who
love
woman
and
party
who
after
a
day
on
the
political
stump
would
pull
off
his
jacket
and
dance
with
the
young
folk
into
the
wee
hour
who
could
hold
his
own
with
a
visit
earl
or
talk
animal
husbandry
at
the
kitchen
table
of
a
farmer
out
in
the
borderland
who
could
not
write
other
than
to
mark
an
x
to
sign
his
name
a
man
who
after
a
long
day
s
work
at
the
printing
shop
would
on
warm
summer
evening
sometimes
trot
down
to
a
waterfront
market
slip
hurl
his
clothes
to
the
ground
and
plunge
into
the
harbour
for
a
starlit
swim
thereby
raise
his
esteem
in
my
eye
howe
s
mission
on
this
trip
as
befit

who
described
himself
as

a
restless

to
keep
creditor
at
bay
he

perpetually
in
debt

of
bad
business

and
his
willingness

keep
his

reader
wherever
he
could
but
also
to
take
the
temperature
of
the

a
series
of

the
labour
of
my
profession
the
only
question
i
ask
myself
be
what
be
right
what
be
just
what
be
for
the
public
good
make
every
reporter
here
bow
their
head
unworthily
when
i
begin
work
on
this
book
i
be
a
columnist
at
the
paper
that
brought
nova
scotians
the
news
that
the
titanic
have
sunk
but
from
the
look
of
thing
might
not
be
tell
them
anything
for
much
longer
while
there
be
still
time
i
be
suppose
to
mull
the
big
and
small
question
about
this
province
whenever
possible
i
be
suppose
to
slam
my
car
into
drive
exit
the
halifax
city
limit
in
a
cloud
of
dust
and
have
a
look
around
like
a
latter
day
joe
howe
i
be
suppose
to
cup
my
chin
in
my
hand
and
consider
the
past
and
with
furrow
brow
ponder
the
future
of
a
place
that
depend
upon
your
perspective
seem
as
imperilled
as
the
paper
for
which
i
work
time
be
of
the
essence
the
contraction
of
newspaper
and
magazine
and
the
slimming
down
of
television
and
radio
station
along
with
the
ascent
of
a
type
of
medium
that
demand
that
the
world
somehow
be
contain
in
character
mean
the
day
be
numbered
for
ink
slinger
with
the
licence
to
see
thing
for
themselves
to
draw
their
own
conclusion
and
rightly
or
wrongly
tell
their
own
version
of
event
but
all
we
can
do
be
what
we
can
do
a
few
thing
after
all
this
time
here
i
do
know
it
s
easy
to
see
how
our
geography
make
us
who
we
be
how
jutting
out
into
the
atlantic
be
perch
on
the
periphery
of
the
country
and
hang
off
the
very
edge
of
the
continent
as
we
be
allow
this
small
stretch
of
land
to
catch
all
sort
of
traffic
from
so
many
faraway
place
some
of
which
arrive
intentionally
some
of
which
just
wash
up
here
we
ve
be
a
bit
player
in
the
big
story
we
ve
be
the
battlefield
of
war
empire
and
the
great
prize
in
the
conflict
for
a
continent
we
ve
see
some
good
day
we
ve
have
some
wealth
we
know
this
because
we
can
still
glimpse
hint
of
it
outside
of
halifax
in
just
a
few
brick
left
over
from
a
wall
or
an
old
b

up

over
the
rim
of
their

and
contemplate
their
next
decision
those
be
different
day
halifax
with
its
great
concentration
of
phd
per
caput
than
anywhere
in
the
country
its
navy
university
and
government
be
just
dandy
but
it
have
evolve
into
an
independent
city
state
the
outlying
area
the
countryside
be
where
the
teeth
gnash
be
loud
the
day
i
walk
into
the
chronicle
herald

in
a
paper
mill
that
have
long
be
the
economic
lifeblood
of
the
proud
town
of
liverpool
close
for
good
the
malaise
be
deeper
than
the
slump
in
newsprint
market
anybody
could
see
that
the
troubled
rural
economy
be
cause
thing
to
unravel
one
day
in
berwick
the
apple
capital
of
nova
scotia
a
couple
of
twenty
year
old

a
local
homeless
man
with
gasoline
while
he
slept
in
a
bus
shelter
flick
on
a
cigarette
lighter
and
set
him
aflame
at
the
other
end
of
the
province
where
for
generation
my
people
have
be
punch
in
at
the
coal
pit
and
steel
mill
i
discover
that
the
only
shift
change
at
j
a
douglas
mccurdy
sydney
airport
be
when
the
late
rotation
out
of

oil
sand
disembarked
from
an
airplane
and
the
next
crew
bound
for
alberta
file
on
my
dad
and
uncle
perhaps
in
that
over
romanticize
way
that
i
have
inherit
use
to
talk
about
the
lovable
oddball
who
once
roam
the
street
of
glace
bay
when
they
be
grow
up
in
the
tough
coal
town
i
thought
about
that
one
afternoon
a
few
block
from
the
old
demont
hacienda
as
i
pass
a
knot
of
hard
look
young
guy
who
to
a
person
fix
me
with
empty
thousand
mile
stare
the
portentous
sign
be
everywhere
in
yarmouth
a
boom
town
during
the
great
age
of
sail
the
best
hope
for
the
future
seem
to
be
a
heavily
subsidize
ferry
that
brought
tourist
for
a
few
month
a
year
one
day
i
pull
into
new
glasgow
which
howe
call
a
thrive
little
village
and
which
a
century
ago
be
hail
by
prime
minister
wilfrid
laurier
as
soon
to
be
the
birmingham
of
the
country
there
in
the
downtown
of
a
place
where
good
people
live
i
walk
along
one
of
the
main
street
and
start
total
up
the
for
rent
sign
until
i
just
stop
counting
i
wasn
t
the
only
person
who
notice
one
day
the
smart
president
of
a
tiny
baptist
university
in
a
pretty
little
town
unveiled
a
report
on
the
state
of
thing
in
this
province
entitle
now
or
never
an
urgent
call
to
action
for
nova
scotians
which
laid
out
as
bluntly
as
he
dare
the
extent
of
the
province
s
economic
and
demographic
woe
there
be
nothing
in
it
that
expert
panel
around
here
hadn
t
be
say
for
a
long
time
i
wait
we
all
do
hop
to
hear
about
a
new
way
forward
the
problem
be
deep
the
news
noncommittal
nova

compare
to
just
about
anywhere
else
in
the

be
a
great
place
there
s
no
deny
that
but
it
be
hard
slog
here

always
have
be
that
as
much
as
anything
be
the
story
even
if
it
be
only
one
part
of
the

down

through
an

oral
history
and
archaeological
evidence
indicate
that
around
ten
thousand

an
old
story
pass
down
from
generation
to
generation
about
how
a
young
woman
once
dream
that
she
saw
a
small
island
float
in
towards
the

the
next
day
at
dawn
they
saw
a
small
island
near
the
shore
there
appear
to
be
tree
on
the
island
and
bear
climb
among
their
bare
branch
alarmed
the

grabbed
their
bow
pull
back
the
string
on
their

and
then
stop
when
they
discover
that

the

in
the

be
every

as
complicate

multidimensional
as
one
might
imagine
the
overwhelm
of
the

people
and
the
arrival
of
a
m

of
pioneer
who
carve
out
pocket
of
the
wilderness
the
random

and
conspiratorial
plottings
the
mixture
of
shameful
achievement
and

forever
onward

yarn
of

never

as
much
so
do
the
way
the
rest
of
world
see
us
for
a
long
time
as
a
place
of
new
start
even
a
promise
land
but
more
recently
as
a
locale
of
shimmer
geography
fill
with
people
in
out
of
step
industry
with
last
century
skill
set
which
be
so
at
odds
with
how
we
see
ourselves
as
a
place
forever
on
the
cusp
of
something
big
a
place
that
still
have
much
to
teach
the
world
about
how
to
live
even
as
it
struggle
as
it
always
have
to
find
a
way
forward
the
human
narrative
that
explains
this
place
and
its
people
far
well
than
mere
event
its
biography
rather
than
its
history
be
in
my
own
stumble
way
what
i
go
search
for
and
what
this
book
be
about
it
be
a
tricky
story
to
tell
for
a
number
of
reason
this
have
always
be
by
and
large
an
empty
place
it
seem
forever
in
flame
and
yet
for
long
period
of
time
not
much
seem
to
happen
economically
it
would
be
hard
to
argue
that
nova
scotia
have
really
work
out
yet
around
here
we
re
always
remind
of
how
great
part
of
this
province
have
be
from
time
to
time
and
how
great
with
the
right
circumstance
and
a
little
luck
they
could
be
again
there
s
also
a
poetry
to
this
small
place
that
i
ve
never
quite
be
able
to
put
my
finger
on
other
than
to
say
that
it
be
as
beautiful
as
it
be
melancholic
and
impossible
as
this
might
seem
that
be
heighten
by
the
hardship
and
perpetual
disappointment
face
by
those
who
call
nova
scotia
home
it
s
an
old
thing
i
try
to
do
here
the
notion
go
straight
back
to
the
day
of
joseph
howe
i
have
try
to
boil
thing
down
i
have
sift
through
ruin
because
everyone
who
walk
here
before
have
left
their
mark
on
this
land
i
have
consider
the
legend
which
tell
of
a
nova
scotia
that
never
be
but
somehow
must
have
be
i
have
contemplate
the
past
even
though
it
be
never
really
past
i
have
try
to
give
you
a
sense
of
how
we
get
where
we
be
and
what
for
a
person
who
live
here
it
be
like
consequently
i
have
have
to
make
choice
which
mean
some
thing
and
people
get
less
coverage
than
they
deserve
and
others
more
than
they
might
seem
to
merit
someday
it
will
be
somebody
else
s
province
and
somebody
else
s
story
but
for
now
this
be
my
explanation
of
nova
scotia
and
so
i
would
direct
you
to
a
line
i

the

i
work
in
the
smallish
twenty
first
century
nova

city
of
halifax
there
s
a

adjacent

where

run
with
less

less

back
there
if
you
look
hard
enough
through
the
tree

scrub
you
could
see
a
camouflage
green
pup

with
a
tarp
across
the
entrance
held
in
place
by
some

up

i
would
periodically
go
sniff
around
back
there
in
theory
look
for
something
to
write
about

really
just
curious
to
meet
the
occupant
most
likely
a
victim
of
globalism

just
plain
bad

who
i
prayed
be
there
of
his
own
volition
not
because
he
have
run
out
of
place
to
shelter
since
i
be
brought
up
to
give
people
their
space
i
never
picked
my
way
up
the
little
incline
and
flip
open
the
makeshift
flap
to
introduce
myself
i
just
stood
outside
politely
ask
if
there
be
anyone
in
there
nobody
ever
say
anything
even
though
i
have
the
sneak
feel
that
the
durable
person
who
laid
their
head
there
be
perhaps
somewhere
nearby
watch
me
then
one
day
i
discover
that
the
tent
be
just
go
as
if
the
occupant
have
be
some
figment
of
my
imagination
it
make
me
feel
bad
not
to
have
do
something
to
get
him
in
out
of
the
cold
to
show
him
the
sociability
of
god
fear
people
with
mortgage
netflix
account
and
acid
reflux
but
i
would
be
lie
if
i
do
not
say
that
i
also
savour
the
notion
that
he
she
be
out
there
somewhere
travel
light
and
free
living
by
their
skill
and
wit
as
unconstrained
as
an
old
time
mi
kmaq
warrior
i
be
due
somewhere
else
that
day
and
rain
threaten
but
i
left
the
halifax
environs
distract
my
mind
make
an
abrupt
leap
to
year
earlier
when
i
live
in
toronto
childless
without
a
mortgage
or
even
a
car
in
those
day
when
the
disposable
income
and
personal
freedom
curve
briefly
intersect
back
then
my
pal
and
i
have
a
ritual
every
so
often
we
would
head
to
some
fine
eatery
we
would
peruse
the
menu
and
ask
the
waiter
pensive
question
about
the
wine
list
then
assume
that
the
day
s
deadline
have
all
be
met
or
at
least
push
off
far
enough
into
the
foreseeable
future
we
would
do
our
part
to
stimulate
ontario
s
food
and
beverage
industry
legend
be
forge
during
the
epic
luncheon
which
could
backfire
if
you
return
to
your
magazine
s
office
and
discover
that
you
have
four
hour
to
write
three
thousand
word
about
a
fail
trust
company
whose
name
you
could
no
longer
pronounce
since
we
be
bless
with
a
sense
of
occasion
one
of
us
would
invariably
sit
up
straight
in
those
glitter
room
and
look
ceiling
ward
as
if
in
search
of
some
heavenly
place
he
would
say
slowly
in
a
tone
deeper
than
his
own
natural
speak
voice
to
the
order
and
then
we
would
clink
and
glug
it
be
a
little
joke
we
have
but
the
truth
be
that
i
be
take
by
l
ordre
de
bon
temp
the
order
of
good
cheer
long
before
i
actually
knew
what
it
meant
inside
some
halifax
classroom
i
enjoy
the
rhythm
of
the
word
even
a
child
can
grasp
the
basic
concept
of
good
versus
bad
cheer
sooner
or
later
i
saw
some
artist
s
render
of
the
seventeenth
century
frenchman
with
their
doublet
and
breech
their
buckle
shoe
and
frilly
collar
in
single
file
they
parade
into
the
hall
of
port
royal
our
plymouth
rock
where
the
story
of
the
white
people
in
this
place
begin
to
eat
and
drink
and
somehow
enjoy
themselves
in
the
face
of
the
dread
that
have
to
haunt
every
explorer
in
land
where
any
number
of
unseen
terror
lurk
outside
in
the
dark
to
my
kid
s
eye
it
look
like
a
high
old
time
and
since
the
order
of
good
cheer
be
my
first
and
most
endure
memory
of
nova
scotian
history
i
thought
it
a
logical
place
to
begin
this
book
a
story
after
all
have
to
start
somewhere
mine
open
the
moment
a
fellow
name
pierre
du
bosc
douyn
who
go
by
du
boullay
walk
into
the
hall
where
those
great
feast
be
held
like
the
other
men
who
have
settle
there
he
have
come
on
a
whim
from
a
place
far
away
chance
of
it
work
out
he
have
to
know
be
slim
but
in
my
mind
du
boullay
s
free
quest
spirit
be
so
directly
link
to
that
of
the
restless
soul
in
the
wood
in
back
of
the
newspaper
it
be
as
if
they
be
connect
across
half
a
millennium
by
the
world
s
most
durable
fishing
line
at
least
so
it
seem
to
me
push
west
in
the
gathering
rain
in
search
of
a
creation
story

i
know
from
the
scant
information
available
that
du
boullay
be
no
fran

he
could
not
like
the
skilful
bodyguard
of
the
governor
of
the
new
french
territory
of
acadia
down
mallard
and

fly
or
from
forty
yard
out
splatter
the
gut
of
partridge
and
of

for
which
they
have
no
name
but
du

be
still
a
senior
captain
in
the

of
jean

be
a

of
l

the

that
have
be
struck
to
raise
morale
after
the
disastrous
winter
before
they
take

for
the

try
to
outdo
the
other
in
the
bounty
they
found
in
the
harbour
and
forest
when
it
be
his
turn
du
boullay
could
look
down
the
barrel
of
his
musket
rest
on
its
fork
in
the
snowy
wood
around
the
habitation
and
turn
deer
bear
rabbit
and
wildcat
into
fare
for
the
banquet
the
cook
then
do
his
part
transform
the
tender
flesh
of
the
stag
into
good
pasty
fashion
something
worthy
of
la
rue
aux
ours
that
paris
street
of
gastronomic
marvel
from
the
delicate
flesh
of
the
beaver
tail
even
make
a
toothsome
sauce
to
enhance
the
taste
of
the
sturgeon
that
the
mi
kmaq
have
brought
him
du
boullay
be
not
single
out
in
any
artist
s
rendering
that
i
ve
see
but
i
know
in
my
heart
that
he
march
into
the
great
hall
of
the
fort
napkin
on
his
shoulder
wand
of
office
in
his
hand
the
collar
of
l
ordre
which
be
say
to
be
worth
more
than
four
crown
around
his
neck
with
the
other
found
member
who
also
arrive
with
spirit
high
and
cheek
ruddy
my
admiration
for
them
shine
through
the
age
because
like
our
modern
day
hermit
they
would
have
be
weary
men
who
have
see
and
experienced
much
men
who
be
still
try
to
forget
the
carnage
of
the
war
of
religion
which
pit
the
aristocratic
house
of
france
against
each
other
claim
million
of
life
in
the
process
they
want
escape
from
a
country
where
the
economy
be
so
blight
that
even
the
king
be
poor
my
shirt
be
all
torn

have
go
through
at

french
throne
and
my
soup
pot
be
often
upside
down
their
health
in
some
case
would
never
fully
recover
from
the
ailment
that
they
call
land
sickness
and
we
would
know
as
scurvy
which
at
first
make
their
gum
swell

their
teeth
fall
out

later
left
them
bedridden
and
wracked
with
body
shake
convulsion
my
research
have
taught
me
that
the
small
band
of
frenchman
in
the
habitation
that
winter
include
noble
with
lan
restless
adventurer
and
men
of
the
low
class
on
the
rise
port

be
an

of

a

for
their

to
expand
france

reach
into

the
rich
of

toothless
their
beard
wild

hair
stiff
with

scent
gamey
fit
that
mould
maybe
like
wander
lordless
samurai
in
a
kurosawa
movie
they
crave
motion
and
action
perhaps
like
a
twenty
first

man
who
would
rather
take
to
the
wood
in
a

with
the
rest

they
never
felt
quite
right
in
their

but
that
be
not
why
i
have
long
be
haunt
by
champlain
i
be
take
with
him
from
the
moment
i
heard
his
name
for
the
same
reason
that
as
a
kid
i
be
obsess
with
robin
hood
movie
and
every
one
of
muhammad

s
fight
because
they
have
courage
and
flair
as
well
as
an
other
worldly
level
of
skill
more
than
anything
i
have
not
be
able
to
get
champlain
out
of
my
head
for
all
these
year
because
of
this
he
be
the
first
genuinely
heroic
person
i
have
ever
heard
of
with
a
connection
to
the
place
where
i
live
he
be
touch
by
splendour
and
by
extension
therefore
so
be
i
what
do
you
need
to
know
about
him
that
champlain
be
a
soldier
who
fought
in
europe
the
caribbean
and
north
america
until
he
bore
the
scar
of
wound
on
his
face
and
body
and
witness
atrocity
beyond
imagine
accord
to
his
biographer
david
fischer
in
a
thirty
four
year
career
at
sea
he
make
at
least
twenty
seven
atlantic
crossing
and
hundred
of
other
voyage
expert
fischer
say
marvel
at
his
mapmaking
excellence
particularly
with
the
crude
instrument
at
his
command
in
the
early
seventeenth
century
he
write
more
and
well
than
any
major
explorer
of
north
america
during
this
period
he
set
the
standard
among
explorer
for
good
relation
with
the
native
people
of
the
new
world
he
be
the
father
of
new
france
be
it
fair
that
i
don
t
feel
the
same
way
towards
him
as
i
do
to
the
other
wanderer
who
come
before
him
giovanni
caboto
be
a
flat
earther
thought
to
have
be
born
in
genoa
italy
base
on
the
painting
i
have
see
john
cabot
as
he
come
to
be
know
have
a
nose
like
a
swan
s
beak
and
a
beard
woven
into
a
pair
of
stalactite
like
his
more
famous
contemporary
christopher
columbus
he
thought
that
sail
west
from
europe
be
the
quick
route
to
asia
people
care
about
such
thing
in
the
middle
age
when
merchant
felt
a
press
need
for
new
trade
route
to
the
east
under
the
auspex
of
king
henry
vii
cabot
left
bristol
in
the
spring
of
on
a
fast
able
ship
with
a
small
crew
they
travel
west
and
north
believe
it
be
a
shorter
route
to
asia
than
columbus
s
along
the
trade
wind
fifty
day
into
the
voyage
cabot
land
on
the
east
coast
of
north
america
precisely
where
be
a
mystery
some
historian
think
he
may
have
alight
at
newfoundland
labrador
or
even
maine
others
believe
that
cabot
disembarked
at
cape
breton
island
perhaps
even
mainland
nova
scotia
in
any
event
think
that
he
have
make
land
in
asia
he
claimed
it
for
england
s
king
i
ve
only
once
be
on
a
vessel
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
ocean
a
container
ship
make
its
way
from
halifax
to
the
french
island
of
st
pierre
off
the
south
coast
of
newfoundland
i
go
in
december
it
get
bad
i
do
so
mainly
for
the
food
which
be
suppose
to
have
be
provide
by
full
fledge
french
chef
st
pierre
as
it
remains
today
a
possession
of
france
and
the
wine
which
be
from
bordeaux
and
burgundy
except
that
seasickness
kept
me
in
my
bunk
for
thirty
six
straight
hour
on
the
way
back
i
bought
a
ticket
on
a
rickety
turboprop
that
only
set
down
on
the
st
pierre
airport
when
the
fog
manage
to
lift
a
phobic
flyer
i
prefer
death
by
plane
crash
to
another
day
and
a
half
of
delirium
induce
nausea
so
i
have
a
respect
for
those
ancient
ocean
explorer
that
go
beyond
what
appear
in
the
history
book
my
pulse
beat
a
little
quicker
when
i
think
about
some
viking
adventurer
at
the
bow
of
his
longship
squint
through
the
spume
for
the
first
view
of
terra

or
century
before
cabot
live
an
orkney
prince
supposedly
on
the
run
with
the
treasure
of
the
knight
templar
peer
through
the
fog
at
the
forest
of
spruce
the
barren
and
beach
and
sharp
prehistoric
edge
of
the
land
when
i
be
a
kid
reading
textbook
it
seem
that
so
many
of
the
european
who
show
up
around
here
back
then
do
so
largely
by
mistake
or
because
they
be
guide
by
some
crazy
notion
they
get
lose
and
sail
completely
off
course
they
come
out
of
a
bank
of
fog
and
jesus
christ
there
be
some
rocky
shore
that
take
the
ship
down
and
ensure
that
those
who
be
left
eventually
have
to
dine
on
each
other
as
they
wait
for
another
misguide
explorer
to
happen
by
a
few
of
them
knew
what
they
be
do
before
cabot
make
his
brief
appearance

i
try
not

bogged
down
in

it

among

people
i
be
just
happy
to
say
that
it
do
because
even
a
fictional
connection
make
it
easy
for
me
to
imagine
the
pair
of
ship
fly
the
naval
ensign
of

and
the
royal
standard
of

the

the

into

only
agile

stop
the

from

aground
on
sable
island
a
week
later
they
drop
anchor
in
a
long
bay
by
a
headland
where
they
stayed
a
few
day
before
head
southwest
along
the
coast
one
of
my
favourite
part
of
the
story
of
the
early
colonization
of
nova
scotia
be
how
as
the
frenchman
sail
along
they
name
place
into
existence
at
one
harbour
they
discover
a
french
vessel
violate
de
mon
s
monopoly
by
trading
fur
with
the
indian
so
the
place
become
port
au
rossignol
name
after
the
ship
s
captain
they
imprison
another
bay
where
a
sheep
go
overboard
be
christen
port
au
mouton
champlain
command
a
small
barque
stop
at
one
place
he
call
isle
aux
cormorans
after
the
bird
he
found
there
and
another
that
he
name
cap
fourchu
because
it
resemble
the
tine
of
a
fork
in
a
small
shallop
use
to
cross
shallow
water
champlain
and
de
mon
turn
the
southernmost
point
of
acadia
then
they
make
their
way
around
the
great
bay
to
a
river
which
they
may
have
christen
saint
jean
because
they
arrive
there
on
the
feast
day
of
st
john
the
baptist
nearby
be
a
wooded
island
that
look
easy
to
fortify
an
important
consideration
when
colonist
fear
death
not
just
from
indian
in
the
wood
but
also
from
european
rival
from
the
sea
there
look
to
be
good
farmland
and
plenty
of
timber
and
water
the
river
appear
to
teem
with
fish
to
the
frenchman
s
dismay
the
moment
they
start
building
their
quarter
cloud
of
biting
blackfly
descend
from
the
sky
and
mosquito
coat
their
skin
the
first
snow
fell
in
the
first
week
of
october
a
cruel
wind
forever
howl
temperature
plummet
freeze
not
just
the
river
isolate
them
from
the
mainland
but
also
their
wine
cider
and
drinking
water
which
have
to
be
hack
out
of
an
icy
block
the
firewood
ran
out
soon
all
they
have
to
eat
be
dry
provision
and
salt
meat
before
long
the
scurvy
set
in
an
event
champlain
described
this
way
there
developed
in
the
mouth
of
those
who
have
it
large
piece
of
excess
fungus
flesh
which
cause
a
great
rot
this
increase
to
such
a
degree
that
they
could
hardly
eat
anything
except
in
very
liquid
form
their
teeth
barely
held
in
place
and
could
be
remove
with
the
finger
without
cause
pain
this
excess
flesh
be
often
cut
away
which
cause
them
to
bleed
extensively
from
the
mouth
afterwards
severe
pain
developed
in
the
arm
and
leg
which
become
swollen
and
very
hard
and
cover
with
spot
like
fleabites
they
could
not
walk
due
to
the
tightness
of
the
nerve
consequently
they
have
almost
no
strength
and
suffer
unbearable
pain
they
also
have
severe
cramp
in
the
loin
stomach
and
bowel
together
with
a
very
bad
cough
and
shortness
of
breath
there
be
write
champlain
no
remedy
with
which
to
cure
these
symptom
consequently
of
the
seventy
nine
colonist
who
winter
on
ste
croix
island
nearly
half
be
dead
by
late
march
when
the
river
thawed
and
the
indian
arrive
with
fresh
meat
it
be
not
unreasonable
to
speculate
that
at
about
this
moment
de
mon
and
champlain
might
have
recall
the
place
across
the
bay
where
they
have
put
down
anchor
month
earlier
at
the
time
champlain
declare
it
one
of
the
most
beautiful
harbour
i
have
see
on
all
of
these
coast
that
sound
about
right
for
when
the
weather
permit
that
be
precisely
where
they
go

whenever
i
go
to
port
royal
these
day
it
involves
drive
through
a
sweet
little
colonial
town
past
artist
studio
and
people
who
look
like
they
make
their
own
honey
it
s
easy
to
find
a
reason
to
linger
in
the
nearby
town
of
annapolis
royal
which
howe
found
decay
and
dull
with
only
the
weekly
visit
of
the
steam
boat
and
the
passing
and
the
repassing
of
the
stage
break
the
monotony
but
where
i
find
lot
to
look
at
from
the
great
harbour
to
the
ample
old
building
that
have
see
so
much
i
like
to
drive
a
little
farther
past
the
continent
s
only
tidal
power
generate
plant
and
home
own
by
folk
who
once
fish
for
a
living
but
now
put
pen
in
the
water
and
farm
atlantic
salmon
like
they
be
chicken
in
a
texas
feedlot
just
before
the
government
sanction
and
paid
for
re
creation
of
port
royal
i
like
to
pull
off
to
the
side
of
the
road
park
and
get
out
then
i
turn
my
back
to
the
water
and
try
to
see
what
they
would
have
see
after
sail
from
the
bay
through
a
narrow
passageway
which
somewhere
along
the
way
someone
described
as
a
gut
before
enter
the
shelter
basin
aspen
oak
and
maple
ran
right
down
to
the

then
as
they
do
today
when
the
frenchman
climbed
ashore
they
step
through
briar
cranberry
nettle

to
think
of

stand
there
for
the
first

the

i
heard

so
deep
and
resonant
it
sound
to
be
come
from
the
bottom
of
a

when

enter

upstairs
in
the
grand

the

be
empty
but
the

so
i
walk
in

nose
around
a

and
the

i
picked
up
a
copy
of
the

news
sat
down
and
flip
through
the

reading

in

an
eighty
five

grow
and
be
geographically
locate
smack

in
the
middle
of
nova

justifiably
grouse
about
some

be
appoint

at

s
saint
mary

which
have
grant
the

an

i
look
at
a

six
mi

warrior
chosen
to
represent
the

in
the
upcoming
canadian
field
lacrosse
championship
i
ran
a
finger
across
the
page
and
read
the
obituary
of
a
woman
name
freda
mae
bernard
age
seventy
three
of
eskasoni
who
be
the

great
great
grand
daugher
of
one
mi

and
the

eventually
i
open
the

door
and
follow
the

upstairs
to
a
big

where
a
bunch
of
people
be
sit
around
talk
i
stood
outside
for
a
minute
and
when
it
seem
like
that
could
go
on
for
a
long
time
i
walk
back
downstairs
into
the
office
sat
down
again
for
a
little
while
more
and
eventually
take
my
leave
back
in
halifax
i
sent
an
email
to
danny
paul
the
mi
kmaq
historian
who
told
me
it
be
all

impossible
to
trace
a

even
a

as
revere
as

to
a

geographical
point
four
century
after
their
death
through
the

i
imagine
i
could
hear
paul

exasperation
membertou
who
would
become
the
first

the

we
all

how
that
turn
out
even
so
in

there
be
lot
of

it
be

one

simply
materialize
from

to
have

a

the

forward
the
rancour
be
deep
between
poutrincourt

but
could
a

have
imagine
a
scenario
in
which
the
missionary
spurn
by
the

by
the

would
just
give
up
on

try
to
found
a
new

in
the
wilderness

what
would
become

that
could
have

field
the
rest
be
a

ruin
when
the

return
i
think
about
the
colonist
i
can
t
help
myself
because
there
must
have
be
a
moment
when
they
sat
in
the
port
royal
hall
face
ablaze
in
the
firelight
wait
to
be
fed
like
the
member
of
some
millennial
housing
commune
and
think
that
what
they
have
there
what
they
have
manage
to
carve
out
of
that
wilderness
be
something
it
really
be
so
what
i
wonder
be
whether
those
men
when
they
go
about
what
remain
of
their
life
ever
cast
their
mind
back
to
those
night
and
this
place
and
what
have
happen
here
i
think
about
poutrincourt
champlain
and
de
mon
all
of
whom
disperse
after
argall
s
raid
left
the
settlement
uninhabitable
most
of
all
i
think
about
du
boullay
from
whom
to
my
knowledge
history
never
heard
again
after
he
left
port
royal
there
be
no
way
of
know
whether
on
his
deathbed
the
memory
of
l
acadie
wash
over
him
as
the
memory
of
his
life
dissolve
one
by
one
it
would
be
nice
to
think
that
it
do
i
say
to
myself
four
century
later
stand
just
where
he
might
have
stood
then
i
get
in
my

almost
on

from

since
i
be
not
a

remind
me
of
the

poke
up
through

in
the

of

that
day
i
be
with
a
geologist
who
possess
a
poet

heart
he
told
me
that
as
we
move
from
west
to
east
we
be
travel
through
layer
of
ancient
time
and
i
ve
never
really
be
the
same
since
now
i
look
to
see
the
old
story
unfold
before
my
eye
as
i
drive
around
this
place
the

up

the

carve
out
by
volcanic
action
in
later
triassic

it
thrill
me
in
the
nerdiest
possible
way
to
drive
down
some
stretch
of
this
province
where
i
ve
never
be
before
past
place
that
the
european
for
some
reason
call
doanes
cove
blackberry
island
and
coffinscroft
and
think
of
the
thin
layer
of
humanity
s
story
atop
the
fathomless
eon
of
deep
geologic
time
to
imagine
history
issue
from
geography
i
happen
to
know
that
in
the
s
two
car
jostled
their
way
south
from
the
settlement
of
barrington
nova

in
the

direction
i
be
now
drive
it
s
picturesque
country
but
empty
enough
that
howe
skip
it
altogether
on
his
ramble
just
south
of
a
nice
swim
spot
they
come
to
a
series
of
dune
they
park
and
walk
west
along
a
rock
bluff
that
extend
a
hundred
yard
or
so
before
it
slant
down
to
the

side
of
the

accord
to
a
newspaper
account
write
by
father
clarence
j
d
entremont
a
local
priest
who
be
part
of
the
delegation
they
could
see
foundation
of
wall
that
periodically
disappear
and
then
reappear
always
run
in
the
same
straight
line
the
whole
structure
they
estimate
be
foot
long
and
the

three
foot
thick
the
priest
s
uncle
h
leander
d
entremont
who
be
also
present
would
later
write
that
the
group
have
see
enough
to
declare
once
and
for
all
that
no
matter
what
anyone
else
thought
this
be
the
one
true
real
location
of

why
when
there
be
so
much
to
tell
about
this
province
be
i
tell
you
this
because
whenever
possible
i
like
my
understand
of
thing
to
arise
from
personal
experience
the
government
of

take
a
stab
at
identify
where
the

other
historian
threw
up
their

in
confusion
or
because
they
just
didn
t
see
the
point
in
get
all
bent
out
of
shape
about
it
h
leander
d
entremont
be
interested
enough
to
write
a
small
book
in
argue
the
case
for
the
second
location
since
i
have
to
accept
someone
s
word
i
choose
to
take
his
because
he
care
enough
to
be
obsess
by
the
idea
long
after
most
people
have
stop
care

these
day
it
s
parkland
around
there
leave
the
parking
lot
i
become
all
discombobulate
and
head
in
the
wrong
direction
past
a
couple
of
mom
keep
a
casual
eye
on
child
play
in
the
sand
and
on
through
some
marshland
traversable
only
because
the
tide
be
out
before
i
get
my
bearing
west
of
the
beach
some
neat
home
stand
along
a
bluff
atop
a
low
cliff
reinforce
by
large
boulder
held
in
place
by
industrial
wire
that
could
have
be
where
d
entremont
meant
or
he
could
have
meant
nearer
again
where
you
have
to
shorten
your
stride
to
make
it
up
the
dune
of
fine
grain
sand
it
s
wild
and
overgrown
now
in
some
part
the
brush
only
shin
high
in
others
the
vegetation
thick
enough
to
leave
it
dark
underneath
to
my
practise
eye
it
have
the
look
of
a
long
ago
nooky
spot
where
excitement
tend
to
intervene
in
young
rural
life
but
i
don
t
see
anything
that
even
charitably
could
be
call
a
ruin
that
be
disappoint
since
i
like
ruin
ruin
be
why
i
be
in
this
place
i
d
never
be
before
at
the
end
of
a
road
that
hug
the
water
and
loop
climbed
and
veer
in
nova
scotia
conqueror
immigrant
religious
faith
industrial
era
and
artistic
movement
have
left
their
trace
all
over
the
place
we
seek
them
out
or
at
least
i
do
because
we
need
reference
point
amid
the
vanish
empire
and
the
disappear
horizon
in
the
vast
ill
define
landscape
that
be
history
i
have
search
for
these
marker
where
i
can
find
them
even
in
a
place
call
sand
hill
park
which
be
too
small
to
show
up
in
my
government
sanction
atlas
hop
to
find
a
few
foundation
maybe
just
an
indentation
in
the
ground
to
show
i
be
in
the
right
place
i
keep
look
around
use
my
hand
to
push
aside
brush
to
see
what
be
underneath
and
the
toe
of
my
boot
to
slide
rock
around
from
there
i
can
hear
the
song
of
what
might
have
be
a
pip
plover
or
atlantic
brant
since
i
know
they
be
common
around
the
salt
marsh
in
these
part
although
i
have
no
idea
what
either
of
them
actually
sound
like
besides
my
own
manmade
commotion
the
only
other
noise
be
the
heave
of
undertow
on
the
rocky
beach
you
could
let
your
thought
wander
here
on
a
summer
day
in
the
early
year
of
the
twenty
first
century
which
be
what
i
do
i
ve
already
told
you
how
constant
squabble
between
the
jesuit
and
poutrincourt
s
adherent
split
the
colony
asunder
and
how
the
english
freebooter
samuel
argall
and
his
raider
sail
up
and
down
the
atlantic
coast
burning
and
plunder
all
the
french
settlement
they
could
find
include
port
royal
his
action
be
propel
by
event
far
away
and
long
ago
when
william
the
conqueror
s
claim
to
the
english
crown
be
ignore
he
assemble
an
army
and
fleet
on
the
french
coast
and
invade
england
the
norman
conquest
happen
in
but
for
the
next
eight
century
england
and
france
would
be
at
it
with
pike
and
sword
broadaxe
and
musket
in
a
rivalry
that
played
out
in
europe
africa
and
the
east
and
west
indie
but
nowhere
more
than
in
north
america
england
s
claim
on
this
continent
go
back
to
cabot
s
voyage
france
maintain
that
verrazano
s
voyage
settle
once
and
for
all
the
question
of
who
have
arrive
first
but
as
the
great
historian
francis
parkman
write
each
resent
the
claim
of
each
other
and
each
snatch
such
fragment
of
the
prize
as
she
could
reach
and
kept
them
as
she
could
in
the
midst
of
this
epic
tug
of
war
at
the
epicentre
of
this
century
and
a
half
long
conflict
for
continental
supremacy
be
the
place
know
then
as
l
acadie
my
sense
be
that
this
would
have
come
as
a
revelation
if
you
be
a
frenchman
return
to
the
smoulder
ruin
of
port
royal
in
some
of
them
travel
by
foot
make
for
canso
where
the
codfish
caught
on
the
grand
bank
off
what
would
be
know
as
newfoundland
be
clean
salt
and
dry
for
transportation
where
they
found
passage
back
to
europe
some
of
the
port
royal
colonist
travel
overland
and
somehow
reach
the
struggle
french
settlement
on
the
st
lawrence
poutrincourt
s
son
biencourt
stayed
behind
with
him
be
a
couple
of
dozen
men
include
his
second
in
command
charles
la
tour
they
spent
some
time
rebuild
port
royal
then
they
sent
word
back
to
paris
that
they
intend
to
follow
the
fur
trade
the
lifeblood
of
new
france
to
do
so
la
tour
would
later
tell
the
king
they
live
a
rove
existence
like
people
of
the
country
by
which
he
meant
the
mi
kmaq
pretty
much
the
sole
inhabitant
here
at
that
time
who
go
bare
chested
in
summer
and
fur
clad
in
winter
slept
in
wigwam
and
ate
the
bounty
of
forest
and
seashore
la
tour
and
his
men
explore
the
coast
and
river
system
in
their
company
they
learn
to
use
mi
kmaq
tool
and
weapon
to
track
bear
and
moose
on
land
and
paddle
birchbark
canoe
over
the
roil
river
and
bay
with
great
toil
they
learn
to
speak
the
tongue
of
the
different
tribe
la
tour
take
a
mi
kmaq
wife
together
they
have
three
daughter
two
of
whom
return
to
france
where
who
know
what
adventure
await
them
one
of
the
thing
i
like
about
la
tour
be
that
he
be
resourceful
as
well
as
swashbuckling
as
the
heir
apparent
when
biencourt
die
he
relocate
the
two
dozen
men
who
then
constitute
the
entire
european
population
of
acadia
to
headquarters
somewhere
southwest
of
port
royal
where
exactly
be
a
matter
of
some
dispute
name
change
at
various
point
this
settlement
be
call
port
lomeron
cap
n
gre
cap
de
sable
port
la
tour
and
fort
saint
louis
and
so
do
location
that
this
place
exist
rather
than
where
it
stood
be
what
matter
call
it
what
you
will
locate
it
precisely
where
you
may
the
point
be
that
during
a
critical
period
in
history
this
bedraggle
little
settlement
be
all
france
have
to
show
for
its
vast
ambition
in
north
america

when
i
hit
the
road
in
this
province
which
be
pretty
much
as
often
as
i
can
my
eye
be
peel
for
decay
ruin
because
they
be
lovely
in
an
imperfect
way
and
because
old
thing
be
reclaim
by
the
past
make
an
impression
there
be
pleasure
to
be
have
in
ruin
say
the
japanese
who
have
a
whole
aesthetic
and
world
view
wabi
sabi
built
around
the
acceptance
of
the
transience
and
imperfection
that
can
be
found
in
the
peel
paint
on
an
old
doorway
or
the
lopsided
bowl
use
in
a
tea
ceremony
we
cherish
the
crumble
barn
in
the
wood
for
the
same
reason
we
cherish
the
parthenon
in
athens
the
british
novelist
and
essayist
rise
macaulay
have
write
because
they
be
extant
fragment
of
some
lose
and
noble
poem
because
they
remind
us
that
even
the
proud
and
powerful
fall
and
all
thing
eventually
yield
to
time
and
eternity
they
tell
us
that
on
this
spot
a
moment
of
great
drama
unfolded

my

pound
when
i
read
that
but
it
seem
to
be
to
the
taste
of
the
monarch
who
soon
announce
the
creation
of
a
new
specie
of
nobleman
knight
baronet
of
nova
scotia
the
only
requirement
for
which
seem

have
be
the
willingness

financially
support

not
much
be
know
about
the
mainland
settlement
that
william

built
other
than
that
it
be
downriver
from
the
ruin
of
port
royal
that
it
be
small
and
that
its
first
winter
be
hard
indeed
when
the
bad
weather
broke
only
thirty
of
the
seventy
settler
be
still
alive
every
day
they
scan
the
horizon
for
the
pair
of
supply
laden
ship
that
have
sail
from
england
in
early
spring
i
imagine
their
anger
would
have
be
deep
if
they
understood
that
the
ship
on
the
final
leg
of
the
voyage
make
a
little
detour
at
the
fortress
where
reside
charles

the
sum
total
of
french
might

from
one
of
them
a
boat
be
lower
into
the

into
it
climbed
an
unexpected
man

in

geography
be
small
but
time
be
large
story
can
double
back
on
themselves
the
theme
repeat
the
timeless
old
question
new
again
like
a
conspiracy
theorist
living
in
a
room
line
with
aluminum
foil
you
must
recognize
the
pattern
i
say
this
by
way
of
introduce
a
story
that
have
be
told
and
retold
so
many
time
with
so
many
dramatic
flourish
that
i
think
the
best
approach
be
to
stick
to
the
just
the
fact
ma
be
version
and
leave
it
at
that
claude
la
tour
nearly
sixty
and
aware
that
the
day
in
which
to
make
his
mark
and
rebuild
his
fortune
be
dwindle
approach
the
fort
s
gate
there
no
doubt
cup
his
hand
over
his
mouth
and
yell
he
outline
a
deal
for
his
son
who
would
have
be
surprised
to
hear
he
have
be
make
a
baronet
of
nova
scotia
just
like
his
father
a
princely
endowment
of
land
along
the
atlantic
coast
be
charles
s
if
he
would
surrender
acadia
and
transfer
the
fort
to
the
allegiance
of
the
king
of
england
charles
would
continue
to
be
in
command
the
only
difference
be
that
his
father
and

would
also
take
up
residence
there
for
his
security
whatever
that
meant

of

nicholas
denys
who
watch
event
unfold
firsthand
say
nothing
about
the
tone
of
the

word
as
he
thanked
the
king
of
england
for
so
much
good
will
towards
him
ala
he
say
he
already
have
a
master
and
could
accept
no
reward
but
from
the
king
of
france
this
answer
oblige
the
father
to
use
the
very
fine
language
on
earth
to
persuade
him
those
rhetorical
flourish
seem
to
have
rubbed
the
young
man
wrongly
charles
told
his
father
that
neither
he
nor
his
wife
would
ever
enter
his
fort
the

retreat
to
his

the
next

thirty

that
the

as
they
thought
best

that

the

up
this
be
a
matter
of
some
consternation
to

that
he
keep
his
previous
vow
his
father

would
never

have
to

later
lose
an
eye
in
an
engagement
with
the
huguenot
richelieu
that
shrewd
spotter
of
talent
sought
razilly
s
counsel
on
maritime
and
colonial
matter
and
appear
to
have
follow
his
lead
when
it
come
to
new

where
he
suggest
block
far
english
incursion
north

and
also
import
a

develop
the
colony
s
resource
and
to
secure
the
crown
s
interest
but
nothing
i
ve
read
explains
precisely
why
richelieu
felt
compel
to
then
appoint
razilly
as
the
new
lieutenant
general
of
new
france
know
that
la
tour
already
held
the
post
razilly
who
have
serve
as
a
ship
s
captain
under
the
great
champlain
actually
decline
richelieu
s
first
offer
of
the
job
yet
a
man
can
only
be
ask
so
many
time
in
early
razilly
sign
an
agreement
to
take
possession
of
port
royal
and
under
the
term
of
a
newly
sign
treaty
to
make
acadia
a
french
colony
he
make
his
headquarters
in
lahave
on
the
southwest
coast
of
acadia
many
mile
south
of
la
tour
s
stronghold
at
the
mouth
of
the
saint
john
river
for
three
year
from
a
distance
they
ran
thing
amicably
together
though
neither
of
them
quite
understood
who
actually
rule
what
they
show
mutual
restraint
steer
clear
of
each
other
s
affair
who
know
for
how
many
more
year
even
decade
the
d
tente
could
have
last
but
razilly
die
personality
change
event
as
they
so
often
do
acquire
a
momentum
all
their
own

we
be
fortunate
that
around
this
time
charles
de
menou
d
aulnay
sat
down
in
an
artist
s
studio
we
can
look
directly
upon
the
forthright
eye
aquiline
nose
and
rosebud
lip
above
the
hint
of
a
double
chin
the
cheek
be
full
the
hair
which
would
soon
begin
to
thin
be
at
that
point
luxuriant
and
backcombed
into
a
trumpian
mound
he
wear
his
moustache
and
narrow
goatee
as
symmetrically
as
a
cross
i
look
for
the
arrogance
and
status
consciousness
that
be
say
to
ooze
from
this
kinsman
of
richelieu
this
aristocrat
whose
people
as
far
back
as
the
early
twelfth
century
be
chevalier
crusader
a
king
s
chamberlain
even
a
commander
of
lance
who
serve
with
jeanne
d
arc
i
don
t
see
it
even
though
d
aulnay
would
have
study
under
the
jesuit
with
the
nobility
and
gentry
of
france
and
later
attend
the
lead
martial
art
academy
of
his
day
study
as
one
historian
put
it
equation
fence
and
tilt
and
the
polished
art
of
the
courtier
everything
i
ve
read
lead
me
to
believe
that
from
the
moment
he
arrive
as
razilly
s
lieutenant
d
aulnay
thought
himself
above
the
rough
hewn
la
tour
the
disdain
be
say
to
be
as
mutual
as
it
be
obvious
while
alive
razilly
manage
to
keep
the
rivalry
in
check
when
he
die
acadia
begin
to
resemble
some
big
city
borough
left
with
a
power
vacuum
after
a
mafia
don
s
demise
let
me
provide
one
example
in
d
aulnay
married
and
soon
after
sire
the
first
of
his
eight
child
at
this
point
la
tour
the
widowed
father
of
three
daughter
realize
he
need
a
male
heir
he
sent
a
trust
friend
to
france
where
his
main
duty
be
to
find
la
tour
who
previously
doesn
t
seem
to
have
paid
such
matter
much
attention
a
bride
around
this
time
d
aulnay
relocate
his
headquarters
from
lahave
back
to
the
port
royal
area
where
the
land
be
fertile
and
his
colonist
could
begin
drain
and
dike
the
flatlands
use
cultivation
technique
that
be
still
admire
today
from
there
on
a
clear
day
it
must
have
seem
like
d
aulnay
could
almost
see
across
the
bay
of
fundy
to
la
tour
s
saint
john
fort
from
these
two
vantage
point
no
more
than
sixty
nautical
mile
apart
their
rivalry
for
control
of
acadia
played
out
it
begin
as
small
trade
squabble
and
evolve
into
legal
claim
and
counterclaim
open
warfare
when
it
finally
come
have
an
inevitability
to
it
to
add
to
the
epic
nature
of
the
saga
a
heroine
have
arrive
as
the
result
of
la
tour
s
hunt
for
a
bride
in
france
fran
oise
marie
jacquelin
be
possibly
a
barber
s
daughter
and
maybe
a
paris
actress
but
most
certainly
a
member
of
some
low
french
line
of
nobility
in
twentieth
century
depiction
she
be
either
portrayed
as
a
middle
age
coquette
paint
by
raphael
or
a
wrathful
valkyrie
tall
fierce
eyed
with
a
sword
clutched
heroically
in
her
hand
we
do
know
this
much
when
she
arrive
at
la
tour
s
principal
settlement
at
the
mouth
of
the
saint
john
river
it
be
aboard
a
merchantman
that
also
carry
cannon
mortar
musket
pike
and
ammunition
i
want
to
leap
ahead
in
time
now
because
in
the
mid
s
so
little
be
really
go
on
amongst
the
white
folk
in
this
all
but
empty
place
that
any
writer
with
an
interest
in
pace
and
flow
would
feel
justified
in
hit
the
fast
forward
button
so
let
me
quickly
tell
you
this
a
few
week
after
her
arrival
madame
la
tour
s
husband
and
d
aulnay
have
some
sort
of
fracas
at
the
latter
s
port
royal
fort
the
la
tour
end
up
in
d
aulnay
s
hoosegow
when
charles
la
tour
return
to
saint
john
he
learn
that
the
king
have
revoke
his
commission
as
governor
and
order
him
to
appear
at
court
back
in
france
to
explain
the
dustup
with
d
aulnay
those
with
his
interest
at
heart
told
la
tour
that
he
be
doom
if
he
return
to
france
they
urge
him
as
a
show
of
good
faith
to
surrender
his
old
fortress
on
the
south
shore
of
nova
scotia
where
the
showdown
with
his
father
take
place
the
very
fortress
i
go
in
search
of
since
the
king
have
order
d
aulnay
to
appoint
a
disinterested
third
party
to
act
as
caretaker
of
the
fort
then
and
only
then
could
la
tour
s
supporter
possibly
be
of
some
help
to
him
i
be
not
naive
i
know
that
fact
particularly
long
ago
one
when
not
much
be
write
down
be
work
of
imagination
a
story
emerges
which
may
or
not
hold
much
in
the
way
of
truth
but
in
time
it
hardens
into
something
great
myth
there
may
have
be
a
very
good
reason
for
d
aulnay
s
next
course
of
action
that
be
just
not
how
history
view
his
decision
in
the
overall
narrative
of
what
have
become
know
as
the
acadian
civil
war
the
burning
down
of
every
last
one
of
la
tour
s
building
after
he
have
in
good
faith
vacate
his
nova
scotia
fortress
simply
seem
to
confirm
d
aulnay
s
fondness
for
moustache
twirl
villainy
more
than
that
we
somehow
feel
for
la
tour
a
classic
underdog
he
could
have
be
a
twelfth
century

under
the

that
d

give
quarter
to
all
which
i
take
to
mean
that
their

would

would
learn
how
d

renege
on

how
he
clapped
madame

how
right
then
and
there
he
order
every

allow
to

so
that

madame

be

around

her
they
believe
so
to
this
day
you
will
perhaps
be
happy
to
hear
that
d
aulnay
do
not
die
a
peaceful
death
in
old
age
surround
by
family
content
in
all
he
have
accomplish
there
be
a
common
pattern
in
the
life
of
many
of
the
tragus
great
figure
who
try
in
succession
to
build
this
place
in
the
early
year
of
the
seventeenth
century
when
i
think
of
the
dot
line
in
the
history
book
that
represent
d
aulnay
s
trek
from
the
chateau
in
france
through
his
fundamentally
aimless
act
of
aggression
that
lead
to
no
gold
and
a
premature
demise
when
his
canoe
capsize
in
the
icy
annapolis
river
i
see
the
same
theme
at
work
as
i
do
in
the
life
of
poutrincourt
biencourt
alexander
la
tour
and
those
whom
follow
aspiration
hardship
and
mostly
thwart
ambition
to
a
man
they
have
bad
luck
the
great
force
of
history
and
economics
conspire
against
them
if
character
be
truly
fate
then
some
of
them
be
doom
from
the
start
nova

by
then
be
still
just
land
from
the
white
way
of
look
at

it
would
be
a
century
before
it
would
start
to
fill
up
and
become
landscape
and
another
two
hundred
year
before
the
landscape
would
start
to
look
as
we
know
it
today
a
reconstitute
fortress
call
fort
anne
now
stand
at
the
the
site
from
which
d
aulnay
left
to
commit
his
atrocity
it
be
a
place
where
once
you
know
a
little
about
what
happen
the
past
can
spread
out
behind
you
like
a
river
in
time
that
also
carry
you
rush
forward
into
the
future
it
can
be
a
bit
much
see
thing
this
way
in
this
place
where
so
much
of
what
be
important
have
already
happen
it
can
leave
a
person
haunt
by
history
that
take
place
before
they
be
born
and
sometimes
never
even
take
place
at
all
if
a
physical
object
have
no
know
narrative
i
will
just
impose
one
fill
in
the
blank
as
i
go
once
great
wooden

slid
down
that
slip
that
be
only
driftwood
on

doesn
t
come
easily
in
my

i
m
write
down
his
view
that
archaeology
by
its
nature
reveals
the
everyday
and
that
all
people
contribute
to
the
archaeological
record
not
just
the
literate
and
the
powerful
the
archaeological
record
therefore
hold
enormous
potential
to
expand
our
understand
and
appreciation
of
those
who
come
before

whole

and
mind
mean
tap
into
a
discipline
know
as
cognitive
archaeology
for
that
to
happen
a
person
need
to
realize
what
be
right
before
their
eye
they
also
need
to
be
able
to
take
the
material
and
make
what
can
only
be
described
as
a
creative
leap
to
draw
some
conclusion
about
why
and
what
the
people
of
the

be
think
when
they
make
or
use
the
object
under

i
underline
those
word
because
writer
be
always
look
for
easy
metaphor
i
see
some
parallel
between
what
fowler
be
try
to
do
with
his

squiggle
and
what
every

about

in

not
nearly
so

attempt
with

to

through

must
conduct
himself
like

i

there
be
truth
to
that
fowler
who
have
a
knack
for
make
the
complex
sound
concrete
tell
me
about
a
simple
iron
pot
now
on
display
at
the

that
a
farmer
in
the

found
when
dig
out
his

it
be
a
little
like
one
of
those
russian
nest
doll
inside
the
first
pot
be
another
pot
and
inside
that

be
some
delicate

cruet
small

that
might
have
contain
oil

vinegar
carefully
wrap
in
moss
and
birchbark
just
by
look
at
them
he
could
tell
that
the
pot
and
container
have
be
use
by
acadian
and
be
make
some
time
in
the
early
s
then
come
the
magical
leap
forward
history
tell
us
that
those
be
dangerous
time
from
there
if
you
re
fowler
it
doesn
t
take
much
to
envision
a
local
farmer
under
arm
guard
wait
for
the
english
ship
to
come
and
his
disconsolate
wife
realize
that
the
time
be
short
try
to
hide
the
possession
that
they
treasure
by
then
some
of
her

might
have
run
for
the
wood

left
to
join
their
kin
far
away
she
might

have
she

about
the

that
await
her
and
her
family
on
the
day
of
which
we
speak
all
she
would
have
understood
be
that
whatever

somehow
sometime
they

so
she
bundle
up

even
some

essentially
on

learn
that
the

be
then
underway
like
every
nova

i

it
would

they
be
at

again
over

uncertainty

with

thing
i
know
about
them
this
make
my
admiration
for
the
acadian
grow
the
seigneurial

on
the

european
feudal
system

a
subservient
tenant

relationship
in
new
france
the
area
that
would
become
know
as
quebec
where
most
of
the
french
have
settle
since
the
land
grant
system
be
looser
in
acadia
there
wasn
t
really
an
elite
there
acadian
consequently
weren
t
always
good
at
pay
tax
or
listen
to
their
priest
since
they
so
seldom
be
under
any
direct
control
they
decide
where
they
would
settle
and
what
they
would
do
once
they
get
there
when
there
be
dispute
they
work
them
out
themselves
often
with
the
clergy
serve
as
unofficial
judge
when
the
british
take
over
the

acadian
show
their
reluctance

anyone
by

away
from
the

around
port
royal
and
annapolis
royal
to
place
where
they
be
even
less
likely
to
be
under
english
sway
for
all
that
streak
of
independence
they
could

along

their
relationship
with
the
first
people
be
particularly
praiseworthy
scholar
think
that
the
old
story
i
recount
in
the
prologue
about
the
mi
kmaq
girl
and
the
strange
men
on
the
small
float
island
may
mean
that
the
mi
kmaq
be
the
first
native
people
in
north
america
to
make
contact
with
european
familiarity
alone
could
explain
why
the
mi
kmaq
leader
welcome
the
arrive
french
colonist
while
every
other
french
attempt
to
establish
colony
in
north
america
be
met
with
arm
resistance
but
the
truth
be
that
first
nation
people
would
seldom
have
as
good
a
relationship
with
white
in
this
land
as
the
mi
kmaq
have
with
the
acadian
they
do
business
together
sent
their
child
to
the
same
school
and
intermarried
often
enough

mi

historian
danny
paul
say
the

culture
even
seem
to
share
value
that
the

hold
near
and
dear
mutual
respect
for
neighbour
democratic
practice
welfare
of
the

before
oneself
and
a
desire

put
a
youngster
to

in
the

be
view
as
more
important
than
time
spent
in

acadian
put
much
stock
in
tale
legend
lament
and
folk
song
that
kept
their
history
alive
because
immigration
from
france
have
dramatically
slow
in
the
early
year
of
the
eighteenth
century
the
rate
of
consanguinity
inbreeding
be
eyebrow
raisingly
high
nonetheless
as
a
group
the
acadian
be
healthy
child
of
whom
they
tend
to
have
lot
reach
adulthood
at
a
high
rate
than
they
do
in
europe
because
they
grow
their
own
food
and
perhaps
because
they
didn
t
live
in
close
big
city
proximity
they
be
free
of
famine
and
epidemic
consequently
the
population

to
be
young

grow
a
factor
that
would
not
have
endear
them

their
english

all

one
english
governor

call
them
perfidious
headstrong
obstinate
and
as
conceited
a
crew
as
any
in

another

a

not
willing
to

into
a
well
way
of
think
the
latter
be
just
plain
wrong
since
the
acadian
bent
geography
to
their
will
instead
of
clearing
forest
they
settle
in
the
coastal
lowland
which
become
salt
marsh
when
the

come

there
they
built
earthen

just
tall
enough
to
keep
out
the
water
when
the
tide
peaked
to
drain
the
dyked
marsh
they
employ
a
technology
that
they
have
import
from
france
the
aboiteau
a
log
sluice
with
a

come

figure
out
that
in
the

between
the

british
rule
acadian

thirteen

innocent
their

follow
by
their
almost
biblical

be
alive
alex
colville
the
realist
painter
who
live
nearby
could
often
be
glimpse
at
funny
time
of
the
day
or
night
sit
here
at
his
easel
he
be
work
on
the
disquiet
image
upon
which
his
fame
rest
a
horse
gallop
at
breakneck
speed
down
a
track
towards
a
train
a
cow
lie
on
a
marshland
under
a
full
moon
that
make
perfect
sense
the
grand
pr
marshland
may
have
remind
him
of
the
lowland
of
europe
through
which
he
tromped
as
an
official
war
artist
in
world
war
ii
i
ve
spent
some
time
star
at
colville
s
painting
which
always
seem
to
have
something
unsettle
just
below
the
surface
like
a
big
fish
lurk
in
a
beautiful
lake
a
serious
man
he
once
told
me
that
in
his
work
he
hop
to
capture
a
moment
in
time
that
be
enhance
by
know
how
bad
thing
can
be
and
that
this
moment
be
okay
for
that
reason
too
the
dyke
land
in
some
place
broken
chunk
of
harden
mud
in
others
fallowed
field
with
hardwood
with
a
farm
silo
or
two
off
in
the
distance
be
a
good
place
for
colville
to
work
in
his
journal
winslow
say
that
the
first
batch
of
acadian
men
advanced
slowly
at
one
point
they
must
have
stop
altogether
because
they
have
to
be
prod
on
by
the
british
bayonet
as
they
walk
their
wife
child
and
parent
try
to
break
through
the
red
line
to
touch
their
menfolk
one
last
time
the
men
wept
as
they
walk
be
good
catholic
they
prayed
and
sang
hymn
as
they
stumble
forward
one
of
those
hymn
be

faux
plaisirs
vains
honneurs
false
pleasure
vain
honour
and
another
vive
j
sus
long
live
jesus
they
might
have
also
sung
a
lament
call
tout
passe
which
you
can
hear
on
a
record
of
the
same
name
by
an
acadian
singer
with
a
gorgeous
voice
name
suzie
leblanc
it
s
a
haunt
thing
even
in
english
beneath
the
sky
all
be
in
flux
everything
pass
on
and
no
matter
what
you
do
our
day
flow
faster
than
a
torrent
everything
pass
on
a
great
truth
other
than
eternity
itself
everything
pass
on
let
us
put
mercy
first
time
be
precious
while
before
our
eye
everything
pass
on
young
and
old
boss
and
worker
everything
pass
on
we
will
take
our
place
and
disappear
one
day
during
our
mortal
sojourn
everything
pass
on
like
the
ship
that
sail
in
the
distance
everything
pass
on
without
a
trace
so
go
the
honour
the
chattel
and
the
glory
everything
pass
on
it
would
in
my
opinion
be
a
mistake
to
interpret
those
as
the
acquiescent
word
of
a
docile
people

drawn
to
a
cross
it

iron
about
fifteen
foot

with
discreet
ornamentation
it
stood
near
an
old
creek
on
some

someone
figure
out
that
this
be
the
point
of
departure
for
the
acadian
the
first
time
i
saw
the

a

twist
on
the

look
back
at
it
while
her
mount
plod
on
here
in
real
life
some
of
the
acadian
also
must
have
turn
and
look
back
towards
wood
and
farmland
and
the
great
headland
of
cape
split
which
in
the
lore
of
the
mi
kmaq
marked
the
gateway
between
the
land
of
the
living
and
the
land
of
the

how
deep
be
the

of

boston

they
hop

always
the

in

but
everything
i
ve

lead
me
to
believe
that
if
franz
joseph

whose
arrival
at
age
thirty
one
mark
the
point
at
which
my
personal
story
join
the
large
story
of
nova
scotia
have
be
ask
such
a
question
on
the
street
of
halifax
he
would
have
say
vaud
pronounce
voh
in
a
french
accent
because
this
be
how
they
spoke
in
the
canton
in
western
switzerland
from
which
he
come
the
question
to
me
be
always
why
i
ve
be
to
vaud
long
before
i
knew
it
be
where
my
great
great
great
great
great
grandfather
be
born
it
do
not
look
like
the
kind
of

somebody
voluntarily
leaf
so
i
can
only
assume
that
thing
be
not
go
well
in
the
old
country
when
he
and
the

decide

grand
by
the

which
in
be
grand
indeed
until
i
discover
timming
i
be
mighty
confuse
about
where
we
come
from
and
who
we
be
then
a
whole
bunch
of
thing
begin
to
make
sense
these
foreign
protestant
who
be
mostly
german
lutheran
with
their
love
of
order
and
efficiency
their
proclivity
for
hard
work
and
discipline
have
nowhere
to
go
but
forward
upon
their
arrival
they
be
grant
woodlots
that
have
to
be
clear
within
two
year
or
forfeit
along
with
garden
lot
and
grant
of
livestock
as
an
adult
male
franz

five
sheep
a

and
a
goat
ahead
be
harsh
winter
and
summer
drought
the
settler
didn
t
always
get
along
with
each
other
or
with
the
british
administrator
who
characteristically
decry
the
slow
pace
of
development
there
be
bad
tribulation
as
the
mi
kmaq
and
french
fought
on
to
resist
colonization
by
britain
the
foreign
protestant
paid
the
price
six
people
from
one
family
be
kill
and
a
woman
and
her
four
child
be
carry
off
during
one
raid
five
people
from
two
family
in
another
in
one
early
year
there
be
four
raid
on
the
lunenburg
peninsula
family
attack
in
their
home
soldier
in
the
blockhouse
two
men
and
some
boy
who
have
the
misfortune
of
be
caught
swim
with
their
family
out
in
the
hinterland
it
get
so
that
most
people
abandon
their
farm
lot
include
i
m
assume
my
predecessor
who
have
be
grant
thirty
acre
a
few
mile
northwest
of
the
settlement
and
retreat
behind
the
wall
of
the
fortification
winthrop
pickard
bell
the
chronicler
of
the
foreign
protestant
and
the
settle
of
nova
scotia
have
recount
with
presume
restraint
that
for
those
who
do
not
leave
farm
for
town
the
number
of
raid
and
their
intensity
increase

my
knowledge
of
science
be
not
only
scant
but
also
base
almost
entirely
on
theory
that
square
with
my
world
view
i
do
however
tend
to
side
with
the
relatively
new
study
of
behavioral
epigenetics
which
have
essentially
conclude
that
traumatic
experience
in
someone
s
past
leave
molecular
scar
adhere
to
your
gene
what
i
conclude
from
this
be
that
if
you
ve
flee
some
far
off
land
where
life
be
so
grim
that
you
be
willing
to
endure
hardship
and
death
to
leave
it
and
if
you
then
find
yourself
in
a
place
where
the
impenetrable
wood
be
say
to
teem
with
people
who
with
justification
want
to
take
your
scalp
it
can
put
a
scare
into
you
that
can
last
for
generation
to
come
it
go
with
all
the
other
thing
an
ancestor
bequeaths
you
in
my
case
the
lutheran
belief
that
no
priest
be
need
to
seek
god
s
grace
along
with
the
resolve
that
allows
you
to
bury
two
child
before
they
reach
the
age
of
three
and
still
do
your
duty
become
an
ensign
in
the
militia
donate
money
for
the
building
of
a
church
that
in
a
later
incarnation
still
stand
today
as
well
there
s
the
get
er
do
attitude
that
compels
you
to
continue
to
pick
up
new
land
as
it
becomes
available
because
onward
and
upward
have
always
be
the
point
of
this
new
life
in
this
new
world
when
we
think
about
the
found
dna
of
this
place
we
all
think
first
about
the
mi
kmaq
and
the
achingly
sad
way
that
they
be
engulfed
by
those
who
follow
and
later
the
french
forlornly
cling
to
their
small
foothold
here
then
i
think
about
the
period
during
which
the
province
be
by
and
large
people
which
be
where
we
be
in
our
narrative
it
s
a
curious
amalgam
of
culture
and
history
of
disparate
strand
that
have
woven
together
over
time
to
give
this
place
its
distinctive
warp
and
woof
the
singular
way
its
people
look
upon
the
world
and
express
themselves
in
a
poem
a
prayer
a
song
or
an
inventive
layer
of
cuss
word
technically
the
newcomer
who
arrive
in
nova
scotia
during
this
period
have
a
choice
canada
wasn
t
a
penal
colony
like
australia
then
be
built
by
indenture
slave
labour
but
it
wouldn
t
be
quite
true
to
say
that
everyone
arrive
of
their
own
volition
either
they
be
all
flee
something
whether
misfortune
war
calamity
or
economic
collapse
it
be
wilderness
then
as
it
be
still
mainly
wilderness
today
yet
this
for
a
whole
variety
of
reason
be
where
they
chose
to
make
their
stand
they
arrive
with
unquiet
heart
they
come
with
dream
that
they
follow
twist
and
turn
sometimes
lose
the
trail
altogether
sometimes
forget
what
they
come
in
search
of
in
the
first
place
sometimes
never
rediscover
their
way
again
their
story
old
as
time
be
be
repeat
as
you
read
this
maybe
that
be
why
they
tend
to
stick
with
a
person
at

they
do
with
me

the

that
the

despite
all
of
their
misery
a
group
of

soldier
one
day
get
it
into
their
head
that
the
black
of
birchtown
be
steal
their
job
and
be
responsible
in
other
way
for
the
white
men
s
own
sad
life
with
club
they
chase
them
back
to
their
shantytown
where
they
then
put
many
house
to
the
torch
when
the
man
who
would
later
become
england
s
king
william

in

never

wretchedness
and
poverty
so
strongly
perceptible
in
the
garb
and
the
countenance
of
the
human
specie
as
in
these
miserable
outcast
there
seem
to
be
no
shortage
of
unhappiness
in
this
place
whose
shin
moment
would
be
so
woefully
short
the
white
loyalist
as
kimber
have
write
left
the
chaos
of
new
york
with
a
wide
range
of
emotion
bitterness
over
britain
s
decision
to
give
up
the
fight
despair
over
their
future
anger
towards
the
american
victor
for
most
there
be
anxious
anticipation
of
what
the
future
would
bring
we
know
that
the
hope
of
some
come
crash
down
when
the
first
boatload
of
newcomer
arrive
at
port

in
may
of
after
a
hard
nine
day
voyage

live
up
to
expectation
but
instead
of
neatly
laid
out
street
and
town
lot
there
be
only
forest
as
far
as
the
eye
could
see
at
that
point
many
of
the

just
sat
down
on
the
rock
on
the
impenetrable
shoreline
lower
their
gaze

wept

when
i
walk
the
street
of
shelburne
i
never
feel
despair
you
can
even
after
all
this
time
understand
the
newcomer
stubborn
belief
that
this
could
become
something
more
than
a
dump

for
the

along

its
grow
number

the
hope
be
that
shelburne
would
be
a
new
and
improve
new
york
city
a
city
that
in
stephen
kimber
s
word
would
be
cosmopolitan
but
more
refine
more
royal
more
loyal
and
certainly
more
exclusive
than
the
place
they
be

forever

there

where
all

thanks
in
large
part
to
a
novel
by
lawrence
hill
call
the
book
of
negro
which
brought
the
story
of
the
loyalist
black
of
nova
scotia
into
the
light
in
somewhat
the
same
way
that
the
story
of
evangeline
have
brought
the
saga
of
the
acadian
to
the
world
thanks
to
this
book
i
found
myself
one
day
in
a
big
halifax
hotel
ballroom
eat
canap
s
and
rub
shoulder
with
the
participant
in
the
inaugural
summit
of
black
canadian
political
leader
they
be
there
because
the
black
loyalist
centre
the
longtime
dream
of
richard
gallion
and
so
many
others
have
just
open
in
birchtown
make
nova
scotia
the
natural
site
for
such
a
gathering
once
black
people
couldn
t
wait
to
leave
birchtown
but
now
the
traffic
be
head
in
the
other
direction
i
learn
folk
come
from
all
over
from
thousand
of
mile
west
in
canada
and
down
in
the
state
from
whence
gallion
s
ancestor
originate
to
see
the
museum
it
may
be
apocryphal
but
i
m
told
that
one
of
the
first
people
at
the
site
get
out
of
their
car
knelt
down
and
kiss
the
ground
just
like
they
be
at
least
come
home

the
notion
of
home
be
an
intrigue
subject
to
some
people
be
anchor
to
a
place
mean
more
than
others
for
them
it
s
hard
nigh
impossible
to
forget
the
old
country
no
matter
how
long
they
call
somewhere
else
home
sometimes
during
this
period
of
arrival
in
nova
scotia
to
which
we
ve
now
turn
our
attention
people
come
in
such
number
that
their
descendant
felt
compel
to
erect
some
marker
in
their
honour
something
that
spoke
of
all
they
have
left
behind
way
up
on
the
northeast
shore
of
nova
scotia
halfway
between

where
the
up
and
down
lilt
of
the

never
fails
to
thrill
me
both
because
it
be
please
to
the

and
because
it
be
just
great
to
know
that
it
can
still
be
heard
in
the
village
of

where
the
undecipherable
gaelic
street
name
might
as
well
be
write
in
ancient
phoenician
i
like
to
stop
by
a
pub
name
after
an
old
fiddle
tune
by
dan
r
macdonald
the
most
prolific
of
all
traditional
cape
breton
composer
inside
the
red
shoe
as
the
old
music
fill
the

and
some
little
kid
step
dance
in
the
scottish
style
stiff
in
the
upper
body
anything
go
from
the
knee
down
i
once
eavesdrop
as
a
couple
of
old
fellow
face
crease
from
time
and
weather
spoke
the
gaelic
to
each
other
as
naturally
as
pensioner
passing
the
time
at
a
tim
hortons
in
parry
sound
one
night
on
one
of
my
many
visit
i
talk
one
of
the
staffer
at
the
shoe
into
lead
me
outside
to
a
small
building
that
be
today
a
store

for
the
pub
s
perishable
but
way
back
when
be
the
residence
where
the
aforementioned
dan
r
macdonald
live
for
a
while
dan
r
would
hitchhike
to
dance
or
ceilidh
celtic
hootenannies
all
around
the
island
since
scottish
tradition
say
that
if
a
fiddler
show
up
at
your
door
you
must
take
him
in
this
shy
corpulent
man
with
his
coke
bottle
spec
and
his
funny
patois
that
mixed
gaelic
with
quote
from
classical
literature
could
end
up
stay
at
some
friend
or
relative
s
home
for
week
on
end
when
it
be
finally
time
to
leave
he
would
pay
for
his
lodge
the
only
way
he
knew
how
with
a
new
fiddle
tune
or
two
that
add
to
the
hundred
and
hundred
he
write
during
his
life
i
love
that
story
i
love
too
that
the
last
time
i
be
at
the
red
shoe
son
in
tow
we
stood
by
the

next
to
the

inflate
like
a
bellow
the
fiddler
slur
her
note
like
a
drunk
then
make
raw
otherworldly
sound
as
one
by
one
the
dancer
make
for
the
floor
it
seem
like
the
happiest
place
in
the

even
though
i
knew
it
wasn
t
always
so
around

at

you
just
sat
there
nursing
a
hangover
as
the
police

squawk
somewhere
off
in
the

the
only
other
human
you
saw
on

ace

have
start
his

career
for
the
same
paper
back
when
jack
dempsey
be
the
heavyweight
champion
of

and
newsy
lalonde
be

would
toss
a
fedora
right
out
of
the
front
page
onto
his
desk
i
know
he
love
cigar
his
memoir
the
first
fifty
year
show
him
chew
on
one
that
s
as
thick
as
a
blackjack
although
oddly
i
can
t
recall
him
ever
fire
one
up
during
those
smoke
fill
day
i
remember
that
he
would
sit
down
his
hair
slick
back
his
nose
straightforward
and
two
finger
his
column
an
even
break
on
an
underwood
typewriter
now
sit
in
the
nova
scotia
sport
hall
of
fame
then
he
would
walk
over
to
where
you
be
pull
up
a
chair
and
start
to
talk
he
would
tell
you
about
ancient
prizefighter
from
cape
breton
you
have
never
heard
of
and
hard
hit
catcher
in
the
old
colliery
baseball
league
about
some
guy
who
have
make
it
in
the
nhl
long
enough
to
have
a
cup
of
coffee
and
some
ball
game
that
start
on
a
wednesday
and
ran
right
on
until
the
follow
saturday
before
somebody
broke
the
tie
the
last
thing
i
may
be
imagine
after
all
this
time
i
really
don
t
know
detail
weren
t
important
the
tale
every
one
of
them
be
wondrous
i
felt
bless
to
hear
them
when
i
first
start
work
on
the
paper
it
be
fashionable
in
halifax
to
call
it
the
chronically
horrid
but
we
all
learn
plenty
in
that
building
which
be
full
of
the
usual
collection
of
dipsomaniac
problem
gambler
and
folk
who
have
found
the
lord
not
a
moment
too
soon
people
who
would
go
on
to
great
thing
and
those
who
would
fizzle
out
in
a
blaze
of
glory
newsroom
then
be
what
we
as
a
society
use
to
have
instead
of
asylum
i
be
lucky
enough
to
make
my
appearance
before
the
internet
when
daily
like
the
morning
chronicle
herald
and
the
afternoon
mail
star
be
licence
to
print
money
we
do
extravagant
thing
like
cover
the
opec
meeting
in
venezuela
and
because
of
the
imperial
connection
maintain
a
bureau
in
london
to
go
with
a
person
or
two
in
ottawa
every
now
and
then
the
publisher
graham
dennis
who
have
his
suit
make
in
london
would
show
up
in
the
newsroom
and
hand
everyone
a
big
fat
bonus
cheque
i
love
write
in
the
same
page
that
brought
the
people
of
halifax
the
news
that
the
wright
brother
have
gotten
a
plane
off
the
ground
in
kitty
hawk
this
in
my
overly
romantic
way
i
love
too
that
when
i
heard
one
of
ace
s
story
i
be
connect
to
the
historic
past
through
the
lay
on
of
hand
i
don
t
mean
in
the
obvious
way
that
the
first
paper
ever
publish
in
canada
a
single
half
sheet
of
foolscap
print
on
both
side
call
the
halifax
gazette
be
publish
weekly
here
when
halifax
be
a
newly
found
city
and
that
by
work
for
the
late
of
its
successor
paper
i
be
part
of
that
long
and
storied
lineage
what
i
mean
be
this
it
s
entirely
possible
that
when
ace
foley
work
his
first
shift
in
someone
yell
copy
on
elfin
leg
he
would
have
hustle
over
to
where
the
ink
stain
wretch
sat
then
perhaps
not
even
look
up
this
fellow
for
they
be
most
always
fellow
in
those
day
would
have
held
his
story
out
for
the
new
kid
to
grab
and
leg
up
to
the
compose
room
you
will
have
to
indulge
me
for
a
second
because
if
that
season
reporter
be
as
old
then
as
ace
be
when
he
give
me
those
saturday
tutorial
in
nova
scotia
sport
history
he
could
have
be
a
work
hack
himself
in
when
the
first
edition
of
the
morning
herald
another
predecessor
to
the
paper
where
i
now
work
hit
the
street
of
halifax
back
then
when
press
war
be
everywhere
in
this
country
all
canada
city
of
note
have
compete
paper
support
each
of
the
two
main
political
party
halifax
have
an
even
dozen
paper
in
those
day
but
it
be
a
small
place
then
so
it
s
entirely
possible
that
our
nameless
journalist
the
one
thing
we
know
about
him
be
that
besides
be
male
he
would
have
be
sallow
since
news
people
until
recently
rarely
saw
sunlight
and
survive
on
a
diet
of
coffee
cigarette
hooch
and
bile
at
some
point
toil
across
town
for
the
main
competition
now
i
can
finally
get
to
the
point
of
all
this
conjecture
i
m
bending
forward
and
backwards
because
at
one
point
there
be
a
paper
in
halifax
call
the
novascotian
it
be
say
that
there
s
never
be
a
paper
like
it
in
this
province
which
be
say
something
in
a
town
with
the
kind
of
newspapering
history
that
halifax
have
the
man
who
ran
it
be
one
of
a
kind
too
which
be
why
it
make
me
so
happy
however
contrive
this
exercise
be
to
think
that
when
ace
hand
me
one
of
his
wife
dorothy
s
cooky
it
be
with
the
same
small
hand
that
would
have
accepted
copy
from
the
hand
of
our
anonymous
scribe
whose
own
hand
a
score
of
year
before
could
have
accepted
the
barely
dry
page
of
the
novascotian
from
someone
whose
fame
have
hardly
dim
after
all
this
time
it
be
a
thrill
to
feel
that
this
succession
of
exchange
be
all
that
separate
me
from
joseph
howe
that
i
be
join
to
him
the
way
a
dog
on
the
end
of
a
chain
be
link
to
its
master
when
i
start
write
this
book
i
do
extensive
polling
well
i
ask
a
few
people
about
who
they
thought
be
the
great
nova
scotian
of
all
time
a
number
of
them
say
angus
l
macdonald
the
premier
who
help
bring
the
province
out
of
the
dark
age
and
sir
charles
tupper
who
snuck
nova
scotia
into
confederation
the
brewer
alexander
keith
and
the
nobel
prize
winner
willard
boyle
each
garner
a
couple
of
vote
so
do
the
prizefighter
george
dixon
and
the
father
of
the
cooperative
movement
moses
coady
eventually
someone
answer
joseph
howe
for
which
i
let
out
a
long
sigh
of
relief
since
i
have
long
ago
make
up
my
mind
people
have
strong
opinion
about
the
nature
of
greatness
a
few
year
ago
when
the
cbc
ask
canadian
to
choose
the
most
storied
canadian
to
ever
walk
this
land
they
picked
tommy
douglas
the
father
of
medicare
and
who
can
argue
with
that
the
scale
be
less
heavily
weight
in
howe
s
favour
for
a
whole
bunch
of
reason
he
be
as
human
as
human
could
be
his
ego
be
profound
he
be
in
one
huge
way
on
the
wrong
side
of
history
when
his
main
work
be
do
write
one
of
his
biographer
dullness
succeed
enthusiasm
cynicism
faith
and
from
that
point
on
his
story
become
one
of
fading
day
and
fall
light
all
of
which
may
be
true
but
howe
have
heroism
in
him
never
once
do
he
occupy
himself
with
small
matter
his

there
and
everywhere
like
no
other
person
i
can
think
of
in
those
day
in
his
time

spoke
well

during
his
time
for
which
he
himself
will
be

then
at
bawtree
and

one
morning
many
year
later

celebrate
the
bicentenary

birth
but
because

in
three
country
and
have
write
book
and
play
about

inhabit
the
man
than
anyone
on
earth
if
anyone
knew
howe
bawtree
do

that
restless
desire
to
do
something
important

in
his
actor
s
voice
when
i
ask
what

big
and
that
never
disappear

continued
with
him
for
his
entire
life

the
time

chuckle
in
a
can
you
believe
it
way
at
the
image
of
howe
who
say
that
sometimes
it
seem
like
his
reader
idea
of
a
free
press
be
that
that
they
should
get

his
intermittent
stagecoach
ramble

the
good
folk
make
sad
complaint
of
the
dullness
of

and
another
two
hundred

he
saw
encourage
enough
sign
to
predict
that
the
nearby
settlement
of
sissiboo
would
one
day
grow
into
a
town

at
the
turn
of
the
eighteenth
century
perkins
threw
his

considerably
beyond
the

of

there
the

have
be
such
a
nuisance
to
spanish
shipping
that
a
trap
be
set
use
a
small
schooner
as
bait
when
it

first
to

make
for

schooner
crack

fall
turn

and
the
bloody
cutlass
be
lower
fifty
four
spaniard
lay
dead
and
die
on
deck
that
day
while
not
a
single
nova
scotian
life
be
lose
when
the
subject
of
liverpool
privateer
come
up
the
rover
be
mention
in
the
same
breath
as
the
charles
mary
wentworth
and
the
duke
of
kent
two
other
vessel
own
in
part
by
perkins
that
also
live
on
for
their
deed
in
the
napoleonic
war
yet
there
s
a
high
pedestal
still
only
one
ship
from
this
province
or
this
entire
country
do
what
a
former
slave
carrier
turn
mail
carrier
manage
to
do
during
these
war
year
i
bring
up
the
name
of
the
liverpool
packet
because
when
north
america
be
ablaze
during
the
war
of
this
two
masted
topsail
schooner
of
baltimore
clipper
design
prowl
the
atlantic
she
be
only
fifty
three
foot
long
just
under
nineteen
foot
in
the
beam
and
have
a
hold
just
six
and
a
half
foot
deep
but
this
small
ship
carry
five
cannon
and
forty
five
men
arm
with
musket
and
cutlass
from
liverpool
with
the
aforementioned
joseph
barrs
at
the
wheel
the
packet
left
over
and
over
again
capture
fifty
american
vessel
during
just
ten
month
no
ship
be
more
fear
than
the
liverpool
packet
no
privateer
more
revile
by
the
yankee
than
bars
who
would
be
twice
capture
and
would
be
dead
at
forty
eight
his
health
broken
by
the
american
prison
i
bring
up
the
packet
because
her
combination
of
nerve
and
enterprise
the
way
she
bedevil
the
american
and
show
open
contempt
for
the
british
government
in
halifax
be
emblematic
of
the
best
we
have
to
offer
in
this
time
and
place
but
i
also
mention
her
because
she
be
own
by
a
man
name
enos
collins
whose
path
have
long
be
intertwine
with
perkins
s
the
second
son
of
hallet
collins
s
twenty
six
child
earn
his
keep
by
go
to
sea
on
one
of
his
father
s
liverpool
ship
but
collins
be
also
eventually
the
first
mate
on
the
rover
and
serve
as
first
lieutenant
on
the
perkins
own
charles
mary
wentworth
by
the
time
the
last
shot
have
be
fire
in
the
war
of
three
of
collins
s
ship
laden
with
supply
for
the
beleaguer
british
army
would
successfully
break
through
a
naval
blockade
off
the
coast
of
c
diz
spain
by
then
he
have
already
begin
use
the
profit
from
his
privateer
ship
to
lay
the
groundwork
for
a
personal
fortune
that
in
time
be
say
to
be
the
large
in
the
british
empire
which
be
interest
even
it
s
not
really
why
i
m
tell
you
about
him
i
bring
up
collins
now
because
he
take
our
story
in
a
roundabout
way
right
back
to
where
it
need
to
be
to
halifax
and
to
joe
howe

among
the
daunt
challenge
face
nova

when
i
sat
down
to
write

out
of
the
countryside
the
last
century
skill
set
and
industry
the
age
population
be
the
simple
fact
that
for
a
whole
variety
of
reason
few
people
want
to
move
here
the
number
over
and
over
again
show
that
those
hard
drive
immigrant
who
be
willing
to
do
three
job
today
so
that
their
kid
can
own
a
block
of
apartment
building
tomorrow
be
loath
to
call
nova

home
this
be
less
apparent
in
halifax
where
the
hustle
of
tripoli
and
the
bustle
of
taipei
can
sometimes
be
glimpse
particularly
in
the
new

also
in
the

they
go
into
a

close
the

sharply
water
down

some
of
the
very
magistrate
who
be
the

of
his
wither
attack
howe
say
that
when
he
look
back
at
the

he
saw
more
of
the
middle
member
of

who
have
suffer
some
exaction
have
some

in
such
volume
that
they
fill
the
entrance
to
his
novascotian
office
he
be
in
a
legal
sense
completely
alone
every
lawyer
he
have
contact
say
that
he
have
no
case
since
as
the
law
then
stood
it
be
libellous
to
publish
anything
calculate
to
degrade
a
person
or
to
disturb
the
public
peace
famously
he
borrow
a
law
book
for
a
week
this
man
who
hadn
t
be
inside
a
classroom
since
age
twelve
pore
over
the
volume
when
he
finally
step
away
from
his
desk
he
told
his
wife
that
if
he
have
the
nerve
and
power
to
put
the
whole
case
before
a
jury
as
it
rest
in
his
own
mind
and
they
be
fair
and
rational
men
they
must
acquit
him
nonetheless
howe
be
nervous
when
he
step
into
the
courthouse
he
only
have
time
to
memorize
the
first
two
paragraph
of
his
address
which
after
the
prosecution
laid
out
its
case
begin
this
way
my
lord
and
gentleman
of
the
jury
i
entreat
you
to
believe
that
no
ostentatious
desire
for
display
have
induced
me
to
undertake
the
labour
and
responsibility
of
this
defence
unaccustomed
as
i
be
to
the
form
of
court
and
to
the
rule
of
law
i
would
gladly
have
avail
myself
of
professional
aid
but
i
have
felt
that
this
cause
ought
to
turn
on
no
mere
technicality
or
nice
doctrine
of
law
but
on
those
broad
and
simple
principle
of
truth
and
justice
to
which
an
unpractised
speaker
may
readily
appeal
and
which
an
impartial
jury
can
as
clearly
comprehend
i
have
felt
besides
that
if
the
press
be
to
be
subject
to
a
series
of
persecution
such
as
this
it
be
indispensable
to
the
safety
of
those
who
conduct
it
that
they
should
learn
to
defend
themselves
believe
me
also
that
the
notoriety
and
excitement
of
this
proceed
be
foreign
to
my
taste
men
of
my
profession
whose
duty
it
be
to
mingle
in
public
contest
and
while
watch
over
the
general
interest
to
wrestle
with
those
who
menace
or
invade
be
too
often
reproach
with
the
invidious
task
they
perform
and
suspect
of
a
morbid
fondness
for
contest
into
which
they
be
impel
by
a
sense
of
the
obligation
that
public
faith
and
common
honesty
call
on
them
to
discharge
those
who
know
me
best
well
know
that
i
would
rather
give
the
little
leisure
that
a
laborious
life
affords
to
my
book
and
my
fireside
to
the
literature
that
ennobles
and
the
social
intercourse
that
render
society
dear
rather
than
to
those
bickering
and
dispute
by
which
it
be
divide
and
by
which
man
be
too
often
without
sufficient
cause

in
array
against
his
fellow
man

have
no
choice
in
the
matter
he
argue
he
print
the
offend
letter
for
the
same
reason
that
he
would
later
fight
to
keep
nova
scotia
out
of
confederation
because
it
be
his
nature
because
he
could
not

himself
he
knew
the
magistrate
well
some
of
them

family
others
he
deeply
admire
in
their
private
life
if
the
question
to
be
decide
by
the
jury
be
whether
he
have
some
wicked
or
malicious
motive
in
printing
the
letter
he
say
rest
easy
for
he
have
none
the
problem
he
explain
be
that
he
also
knew
these
men
as
magistrate
whose
job
include
the
guardianship
of
moral
and
the
public
peace

that
he
knew

them
as
almost
every
man
in
the
community
know
them
to
be
the
most
negligent
and
imbecile

most
reprehensible
body
that
ever
mismanage
a
people
s
affair
for

he
point
out
that
he
hadn

of

in
the

in

it

he
would
have
eschew
any
showy

he
be
just
natural
and
if
you
be
a
natural
speaker
you
driven
not
by
technique
but
to
communicate
your
voice
as
befit
an
orator
who
once
wander
into
a
london
debate
club
and
left
twenty
minute
later
to
cry
of
why
isn
t
this
man
our
prime
minister
from
the
assemble
crowd
sometimes
when
howe
be
get
down
to
the
business
of
speak
he
would
pull
his
coat
off
of
his
shoulder
and
allow
it
to
dangle
loosely
from
his
arm
which
bawtree
would
do
too
though
these
be
the
day
before
microphone
howe
sometimes
spoke
to
crowd
of
five
thousand
in
a
farmer
s
field
so
bawtree
figure
he
have
a
round
voice
that
be
good
at
project
he
be
a
man
who
love
word
he
say
if
you
love
word
you
want
them
to
be
heard
as
howe
s
word
rang
throughout
the
small
room
the
magistrate
must
have
know
their
day
would
be
long
the
sinking
feel
have
to
strike
them
the
moment
the
defendant
take
the
routine
language
of
a
libel
indictment
that
he
be
wickedly
maliciously
and
seditiously
contrive
devise
and
intend
to
stir
up
and
excite
discontent
and
sedition
among
his
majesty
s
subject
and
turn
it
into
a
stir
profession
of
loyalty
for
the
british
crown
as
well
as
a
blanket
condemnation
of
the
magistrate
themselves
if
the
king
be
in
the
courtroom
howe
go
on
these
prosecutor
would
shrink
before
the
indignant
glance
of
the
sovereign
whose
trust
they
have
abuse
his
majesty
would
tell
them
that
he
who
robs
the
subject
make
war
upon
the

that
he
who
delay

withholds

excites

that
against

his
sense
of

be
my

bawtree
say
so
it
be
easy
for
him
to
do
justice
to
the
account
of
the
trial
which
frequently
mention
the
laughter
of
the
audience
and
for
all
we
know
the
jury
member
themselves
as
howe
gather
steam
and
confidence
at
the
same
time
reading
howe
s
word
after
all
these
year
you
can
still
feel
an
anger
that
be
deeply
personal
these
men
have
drag
him
from
his
home
and
have
him
arraign
before
you
as
a
criminal
they
hop
to
destroy
his
reputation
his
livelihood
and
the
financial
future
of
his
family
in
the
apologetic
manner
of
a
colonial
tom
hagen
howe
say
that
they
have
place
me
in
a
position
where
the
performance
of
a
disagreeable
duty
be
essential
to
my
own
safety
and
to
the
public
safety
also
they
should
remember
that
he
say
with
a
verbal
shrug
as
the
vivisection
continued

purely
by
coincidence
precisely
year
after
howe
s
trial
i
found
myself
walk
up
and
down
a
busy
arterial

in
his

on

of

stoppage
with
no

in

by
then
the
adrenaline
buzz
of
the
first
few
week
on
the
picket

have
give
way
to
the
numb
reality
that
we
could
be
do
this
for
a
very
long
time
pattern
have
begin
to
emerge
a

about

some
of

the
tedious

up

down

like
religious
penitent
sometimes
we
do
so
together
sometimes
we
just
trudge
back

forth
in

on
those
day
this
project
well
underway
and
my
mp
player
on
the

my
thought
sometimes
turn
to
howe
i
didn
t
think
a
great
deal
about
the
trial
itself
the
deft
manner
in
which
he
demonstrate
how
the
town
s
worthy
have
fleece
the
citizenry
his
epic
takedown
of
the

of

school
of

that
be
suppose
to
go
to
the
down
on
their
luck
like
everybody
familiar
with
his
story
i
knew
about
his
acquittal
which
take
the
jury
just
ten
minute
and
his
subsequent
proclamation
in
the
novascotian
that
the
press
of
nova
scotia
be
free
after
all
of
this

howe
who
be
carry
through
the

of
halifax
after
his
acquittal
get
credit
for
bring
freedom
of
the
press
to
canada
but
that
s
not
really
true
nine
year
later
his
successor

broke
up
that

conditionally
what
they

that

a

step
be
take
tupper
use
his
power

favour
confederation
through

before
he
have
an

to
face
in

instead

run
to

the

of
a

in

howe

tell
anyone
who
would
listen
that
the

be
a
bad
one
for
nova
scotia
he
lead
a
delegation
to
london
not
once
but
twice
to
oppose
the
passage
of
an
act
of

and
later
to
repeal
it
he
write
and
spoke
cajole
and
wheedle
nothing
work
much
of
what
howe
fear
would
happen
to
nova
scotia
after
confederation
simply
do
yet
once
he
realize
that
the
tectonic
plate
of
nationhood
be
fuse
together
he
negotiate
an
agreement
that
provide
well

then
enter
john

his

wasn

really
what

about

i
trudge
back

forth
on

as
the

and
the

more
often
about
the
manner
in

howe

will
be

will
spread
to

along

will
stop
to

of
his
conflict
from
time
to
time
as
the
day
mount
and
my
mood
darken
i
thought
naturally
about
his
trio
of
journalistic
question
what
be

what
be
just
what
be

loose
in

sometimes
in

him
into

he
spent
some
day
pleasantly
enough
there
as
he
would
meticulously
account
he
brought
some
butter
and
a
barrel
of
potato
on
board
and
fill
six
barrel
with
water

he
stow
under

slocum
saw
a
tin
clock
sell
for
a

and
a
half
but
because
the
face
be
smash
the
merchant
let
him
have
it
for
a

the
bad

they
built

because
when

they
could
sell
the

as

as
the

they

only
rarely

frequently
the

that

there
s
a

we

understand
how

the

much
in

the

their

cross
over

otherwise
i

the

a

rag
and
justice
be
meted
out
to
the

so
it
felt
good
to
think
about
a
time
when
someone
walk
these
street
during
business
hour
could
buy
some
fancy
millinery
a
glimmer
watch
or
a
patent
medicine
that
would
cure
whatever
ail
them
they

great
be
the

declare
that
i
would
make
it
pay
this
be
how
you
met
him
some
page
ago
he
would
have
know
by
then
that
the
time
of

and
the

of
all
the
great
nova

almost
continuously

for
nearly
three
quarter
of
the

north
america
by

attribute
to
an

for
the
quintessential
nova

how

compete
with
the
unfettered
ocean
where
great
adventure
await
i
have
a
little
fantasy
about
slocum
who
would
disappear
fourteen
year
later
after
leave
martha
s
vineyard
to
explore
venezuela

he
wasn

actually
lose
at

instead
tire
and
old
he
somehow
make
it
to
some
island
where
the
weather
be
warm
and
no
one
have
ever
heard
of
a
man
who
be
born
in
the
breeze
in
a
place
call
nova
scotia
in
my
reverie
he
live
out
his
life
there
unknown
and
happy
but
this
be
a
book

in

so
i
will
say
that
in

the
shin

most
exalt

he
stow
his
good
for
the
boisterous
atlantic
he
take
down
the

that
his
ship
the

would
be
the
whole

with
it
on

then
on

after

nasty
short
gale

come

propitious
for

the
next
morning
when

he
discover
that
the
head

then
and
now
the
unaccustomed
smell
of
prosperity
a
couple
of
year
ago
i
read
in
the
paper
that
the
town
of
dominion
have
to
demolish
its
high
school
and
hockey
rink
after
both
building
start
to
sink
into
the
crumble
mine
shaft
that
run
underneath
them
i
learn
that
part
of
one
of
the
main
street
in
glace
bay
would
periodically
collapse
into
an
old
abandon
mine
shaft
just
below
the
surface
i
learn
that
a
hole
a
metre
or
so
wide
and
a
couple
of
metre
deep
one
day
just
materialize
in
the
front
yard
of
a
house
own
by
a
man
name
robert
currie
in
the
town
of
donkin
after
its
appearance
a
seventy
five
year
old
woman
who
live
nearby
be
never
quite
the
same
she
couldn
t
sleep
at
night
for
fear
that
the
crater
be
go
to
keep
widen
until
it
claimed
not
just
currie
s
house
but
hers
as
well
and
for
all
she
knew
the
rest
of
their
hometown
all
throughout
the
coal
land
of
cape
breton
it
be
my
understand
that
the
ground
will
just
open
up
when
that
happens
a
truck
full
of
municipal
employee
in
hard
hat
and
work
boot
will
materialize
and
a
couple
of
them
will
get
out
and
throw
a
few
shovelful
of
concrete
into
the
hollow
out
area
then
a
few
month
later
it
will
all
happen
again
even
if
the
ground
doesn
t
entirely
give
way
it
can
still
seem
alive
rasp
and
groan
not
just
in
glace
bay
and
dominion
and
donkin
but
in
the
other
mining
community
on

across

and
even
across
the
causeway
to
the
mainland
of
nova
scotia
in
westville
stellarton
and
springhill
where
disconcert
pop
and
crack
can
still
be
heard
way
down
underground
even
though
coal
mining
end
in
those
place
a
long
time
ago
i
can
t
get
that
image
out
of
my
head
maybe
because
it
harkens
back
to
those
horror
movie
i
would
watch
as
a
kid
where
some
innocent
soul
would
be
in
a
cemetery
and
a
skeletal
hand
from
beyond
the
grave
would
burst
through
the
soil
more
hand
emerge
from
the
ground
then
whole
body
the
dead
return
usually
because
they
have
some
unfinished
business
with
the
living
it
s
an
infantile
notion
i
know
but
that
can
be
how
i
feel
walk
over
this
land
where
the
industrialize
past
haunt
this
province
still
not
far
from
where
my
grandparent
live
and
my
dad
and
his
two
brother
grow
up
be
a
place
call
senator
s
corner
one
of
the
cardinal
point
of
the
aforementioned
town
of
glace
bay
i
use
to
just
walk
by
it
with
barely
a
thought
now
i
understand
that
when
a
person
stand
on
that
spot
they
be
directly
over
a
bed
of
coal
call
the
harbour
seam
as
well
as
the
phalen
and
emery
seam
if
a
person
with
superman
s
x
ray
vision
could
look
straight
down
from
senator
s
corner
they
would
see
three
football
field
worth
of
alternate
layer
of
mine
working
and
rock
if
i
somehow
saw
such
a
thing
i
might
genuflect
right
there
might
fall
to
my
knee
as
the
pedestrian
and
traffic
pass
and
press
my
forehead
to
the
sidewalk
way
down
in
those
tunnel
i
know
have
crunched
the
number
more
men
from
this
province
have
die
than
met
their
maker
in
the
great
war
in
nearly
every
coal
town
in
this
province
i
ve
visit
and
i
ve
visit
them
all
there
s
a
monument
to
the
dead
many
of
the
name
match
body
never
recover
from
the
deep
they
re
down
there
still
or
at
least
their
spirit
be
bury
beneath
million
of
ton
of
rock
mile
from
blue
sky
and
air
that
smell
of
cut
hay
and
ocean
brine
some
of
them
i
suspect
be
my
kin
don
t
ask
me
for
the
name
because
the
folk
who
could
supply
such
information
be
long
go
now
i
do
know
with
absolute
certainty
that
one
day
in
one
of
my
forebear
take
a

which
be
the

i
bring
this
up
for
the

of

as
my

sat
in

listen
to

scurry
by
in

it
be
a

at

no

which
fuel
the

be
the
key
to
this

coal
meant
that

discover
it

spare
you
the

than
to

when
i
think
of
the
time
when
industrialization
take
hold
in
nova

it
be
unlike
the
other
epoch
in
this

where
i
m
just
nose
around
a
little
and
let
my
imagination
fill
in
the
blank
when
i
think
about
this
period
i
think
about
my
maternal
grandfather
jack
brier
a
taciturn
old
widower
by
the
time
he
take
the
train
down
to
halifax
to
stay
with
his
daughter
and
her
family
silence
seem
to
envelop
him
as
he
sat
in
a
chair
in
our
living
room
reading
about
the
past
and
then
head
off
in
midafternoon
for
a
pint
in
a
local
near
our
house
it
be
odd
give
that
i
now
talk
to
stranger
for
a
living
that
i
didn
t
think
to
ask
him
much
back
then
he
could
have
told
me
about
the
horror
of
the
somme
and
passchendaele
he
could
have
told
me
thing
or
two
about
what
it
be
like
to
blow
the
clarinet
at
saturday
night
dance
at
the
north
sydney
yacht
club
to
thump
the

during
sunday
church
service
and
coax
sad
sound
from
the

return
from

with
the
rest
of
the

mostly
he
could
have
told
me
about
what
it
be
like
to
go
down
into
the
coal
mine
at
a
pitifully
young
age
and
spend
half
a
century
in
one
form
or
another
underground
i
think
about
him
a
lot
down
there
in
the
dark
far
under
the
ocean
floor
where
most
of
the
cape
breton
colliery
extend
just
as
i
think
about
ned
demont
my
father
s
grandfather
who
in
the
early
part
of
the
twentieth
century
be
living
his
own
industrial
age
life
in
nearby
sydney
the
demonts
the
spelling
be
all
over
the
place
but
this
be
the
one
i
use
didn
t
range
far
after
franz
timon
get
off
the
gale
in
lunenburg
in
they
put
down
root
along
the
coast
become
farmer
and
small
businessmen
i
don
t
know
how
long
ned
and
his
wife
and
kid
have
be
living
in
windsor
when
the
great
fire
of
roar
through
the
town
i
just
know
that
at
that
point
my
people
be
also
swept
along
by
the
great
economic
force
then
transform
the
developed
world
a
brother
of
ned
s
found
work
in
the
roll
mill
of
pictou
county
the
province
s
other
industrial
hub
ned
at
this
point
be
forty
one
that
didn
t
stop
my
great
grandfather
from
decide
to
take
his
wife
and
four
kid
to
sydney
where
he
understood
that
the
whitney
steel
mill
soon
to
be
consume
about
half
of
the
coal
that
jack
brier
and
every
other
cape
breton
collier
could
harvest
be
hire
i
ve
driven
a
lot
around
the
north
end
of
sydney
look
for
the
old
house
where
they
settle
the
place
where
my
father
and
his
brother
would
visit
as
little
kid
and
lie
in
bed
peer
out
the
window
at
the
flame
from
the
steel
mill
s
stack
that
flash
lit
the
night
sky
it
s
not
surprising
that
i
ve
never
found
it
over
the
year
i
ve
watch
the
remnant
of
the
age
of
steel
and
coal
disappear
around
here
go
the
dark
satanic
steel
mill
and
coke
oven
go
the
urban
badlands
the
ground
once
pollute
to
a
depth
of
seven
story
the
landfill
big
than
a
hundred
football
field
so
emblematic
of
the
horror
of
industrialization
go
the
tidal
estuary
so
thick
with
poison
that
it
be
say
that
a
grown
man
could
stand
atop
it
i
still
walk
through
the
coal
town
of
cape
breton
and
pictou
and
cumberland
county
the
same
way
i
explore
the
bucolic
land
where
the
acadian
before
the
grand
d
rangement
thrive
like
an
archaeologist
search
for
the
remains
of
some
ancient
culture
it
s
still
easy
here
where
the
roll
of
a
village
green
hide
the
entrance
to
some
long
abandon
mine
entrance
and
the
name
of
the
neighbourhood
and
street
can
so
often
be
trace
back
to
a
colliery
or
the
man
who
manage
it
nova
scotia
have
many
define
architectural
feature
the

of
lunenburg
the
salt
box
house
in
the
fishing
village
halifax
s
stately

but
most
of
all
the
rough
little
two
storey
semi

wood
frame
box
arrange
in
the
same
linear
fashion
throughout
the
colliery
town
one
spring
day
i
spent
an
entire
afternoon
travel
through
the
old
industrial
town
of
cape
breton
look
for
company
home
hundred
maybe
even
thousand
of
them
be
in
great
shape
spruce
up
and
full
of
life
but
in
some
case
the
other
half
of
the
duplex
be
board
up
abandon
by
its
owner
or
demolish
altogether
not
surprising
i
suppose
in
a
place
then
midway
through
a
multi
million
dollar
program
to
demolish
hundred
of
abandon
and
derelict
home
in
the

municipality
as
the
collective
of

as
i
wheel
around
i
discover
that
part
of

new
victoria
look
like
detroit
the
lawn
of
the
untended
old
residence
overgrown
with
neglect
the
structure
sag
and
unstable
after

in
there
i
have
to
tell
you
i
love
this
part
of

more
than
a

who
live
there
for
just
a
year
as
a
child
and
a
few
month
as
an

a
right

in
one

pack
of

the
street
behind
me
on
the
hunt
for
human
prey

when
those
shack
be
new
they
hum
with

the
boggy
street
teem
with

she
played
with

i
have
some
trouble
therefore
visualize
her
in

the
way
that
the

kept
the

their

in
everlasting
slavery
and
the
danger
in
the
inhuman
deep
when
mclachlan
typed
the
name
of
roy
wolvin
the
owlish
montrealer
who
have
emerge
as
the

of
the
british
conglomerate
that
enjoy
near
absolute
control
over
cape
breton
s

he
would
have
pound
the
key
as
if
they
be
the
bone
of
wolvin
himself
the
wolf
paid
dividend
to

his
crony
rather
than
spending
the
money
on
badly
need
upgrade
for
the
mine
though
the
miner
could
barely
pay
for

and
food
he
cut
their
pay
packet
when
the

struck

that
a

it
seem
like
such
a
one
side
fight
this
campaign
between
work
folk
and
the
rapacious
men
of
industry
but
the
proletariat
of
cape

fought
on
because
there
be
nothing

they
could
do
between

grow
up
hearing
about
what
happen
next
not
in

in
drib
and
drab
how
wolvin

another
wage
cut
how
even
before
the
percent
strike
so
call
because
the

to
clothe

that
have
sprung
up
in
church
basement
and
soup
kitchen
the
despair
be
such
that
a
glace

health
official
sent
a
report
to

that
thousand

the

fought

and
retook
the

like
two
army
fight
for
terrain
it
be
in
the
eye
of
aunt
eva
and
virtually
every
other
family
member
i
ve
talk
to
a
battle
between
good
and
evil
as
starkly
black
and
white
as
nurse
ratched
v
randle
mcmurphy
i
ve
do
my
best
to
separate
fact
from
fiction
over
the
year
i
ve
read
old
newspaper
microfiche
until
my
eye
cross
i
ve
sift
through
the
impressive
collection
of
historical
write
on
the
subject
both
academic
and
popular
in
nature
even
with
the
pretense
of
journalistic
impartiality
it
be
hard
to
find
my
way
to
any
version
of
the
fact
that
doesn
t
bring
my
aqueous
humour
to
a
roll
boil
truthfully
it
take
me
a
long
time
to
write
this
paragraph
because
i
m
so
wound
up
that
the
word
just
come
out
in
a
way
that
be
unsuitable
for
a
book
meant
to
be
read
by
the
kind
of
courtly
folk
i
hope
will
pick
this
up
so
i
just
go
back
and
start
again
because
i
want
you
to
imagine
what
it
be
like
during
the
bad
day
in
the
colliery
town
when
the
late
union
contract
have
expire
and
the
wolf
have
cut
off
every
bit
of
credit
at
the
company
store
to
the
already
starve
miner
and
their
family
now
people
be
left
to
pick
through
the
garbage
for
half
spoil
food
and
entire
family
have
to
subsist
on
black
tea
molasses
and
soup
bone
child
left
to
sleep
seven
to
a
bed
fully
clothed
in
their
hovel
couldn
t
go
outdoors
because
they
didn
t
have
boot
or
sock
and
suffer
from
rickets
and
malnutrition
i
ve
never
eyeball
a
picture
of
the
new
waterford
miner
on
the
june
day
in
that
i
have
in
mind
i
can
see
them
anyway
in
their
cloth
cap
their
thick
pant
held
up
by
suspender
or
cinched
by
belt
their
shirt
open
at
the
neck
with
the
sleeve
roll
up
over
muscle
cord
forearm
the
sharpness
of
the
cheekbone
and
jawlines
the
loose
way
their
heavy
clothes
hung
would
have
hint
at
their
hunger
if
there
be
grin
on
any
of
the
face
they
would
have
resemble
the
nervous
smile
of
the
soldier
before
go
into
battle
at
that
point
more
than
five
thousand
great
war
serviceman
be
on
the
coal
company
payroll
on
cape
breton
island
some
of
them
be
surely
here
get
ready
to
march
on
a
power
station
that
the
company
s
constable
have
recently
recapture
to
keep
its
mine
from
flood
it
would
have
take
some
time
for
the
crowd
thought
to
be
in
the
thousand
to
gather
someone
at
a
certain
point
must
have
say
something
or
perhaps
a
couple
of
the
men
just
start
walk
and
the
rest
cast
i
guess
this
be
it
glance
at
each
other
follow
i
imagine
them
move
haltingly
at
first
along
the
path
run
along
the
rail
line
head
west
from
new
waterford
and
slow
down
again
as
they
hit
the
wood
but
their
collective
heart
would
have
be
beating
faster
when
they
emerge
from
the
forest
by
then
some
of
them
might
even
have
broken
into
a
small
jog
the
thousand
of
boot
make
a
sound
that
seem
to
issue
from
the
deep
in
the
summer
earth
they
weren
t
necessarily
hardcore
unionist
or
even
really
political
the
nuance
of
profit
margin
and
dividend
payout
ratio
be
almost
certainly
far
beyond
their
elementary
school
education
and
their
nineteenth
century
life
they
just
knew
that
there
be
injustice
in
this
world
that
when
a
man
work
as
hard
as
they
do
his
child
shouldn
t
be
left
to
starve
in
the
cold
it
be
the
dream
of
their
ancestor
it
be
their
dream
too
as
they
step
from
the
wood
into
the
opening
where
the
men
with
the
gun
wait
trigger
finger
ready

you
know
how
this
story
be
go
to
end
nothing
withstands
the
great
force
of
history
the
second

take
in
the
early
year
of
the
twentieth
century
by
that
time
william
have
pass
the
operation
of
the

his

as
be
often
say
be
big
enough
for
a

but
too
small
for

that
part
of
the
dennis
family
still
own
canada
s
last
remain
independent
daily
newspaper
when
i
sign
up
for
another
tour
of
duty
there
in
from
the
look
of
clara
dennis
s
picture
a
nice
respectable
life
be
have
in
this
house
that
if
not
a
mansion
still
have
the
air
of
victorian
prosperity
about
it
right
down
to
the
cocker
spaniel
lounge
on
the
front
step
and
the
black
domestic
name
sam
who
look
after
the
ground
and
generally
add
to
the
comfort
of
dennis
life
yet
indication
be
that
she
chafed
against
the
restriction
of
an
upper
crust
life
in
this
small
provincial
city
in
the
early
part
of
the
twentieth
century
i
say
this
because
she
could
have
just
be
content
with
those
progressive
after
dinner
chat
lead
by
her
mother
about
how
to
improve
the
lot
of
the
disadvantage
woman
and
child
of
nova
scotia
she
could
have
found
fulfilment
work
as
her
father
s
assistant
at
the
halifax
herald
office
which
be
regard
as
appropriate
employment
then
for
a
young
woman
who
have
attend
two
university
and
study
stenography
and
type
at
my
old
alma
mater
the
halifax
business
college
let
s
face
it
she
could
have
whiled
away
her
weekend
picnic
on
the
halifax
arm
and
her
summer
vacation
at
the
family
farm
instead
one
day
in
an
apartment
in
london
england
she
look
at
a
map
of
nova
scotia
apparently
for
the
first
time
in
a
while
what
a
warm
glow
come
over
me
at
the
sight
of
the
familiar
odd
shape
little
province
by
the
sea
my
own
my
native
land
she
later
write
at
some
point
dennis
return
to
that
little
province
by
the
sea
she
bought
some
pen
and
notebook
she
acquire
a
camera
perhaps
one
of
the
popular
box
model
then
make
by
the
eastman
kodak
company
then
she
jumped
in
a
jalopy
with
friend
or
family
or
maybe
alone
and
head
for
the
halifax
city
limit
her
plan
be
straightforward
i
would
travel
over
her
highway
and
byway
she
write
in
the
first
of
her
book
about
her
native
province
i
would
know
her
city
her
town
her
village
i
would
visit
the
remote
and
but
little
frequent
island
of
her
coast
i
would
talk
with
the
men
woman
and
child
i
would
meet
in
their
life
would
be
unfolded

soul
of

as
she
travel

observation

would
later
describe

outside

squint

she
prefer
turn
the

on
others

she
rove
nova

during
the
great
depression
and
the
interwar
year
in
her
book
she
s
mostly
a
chronicler
of
the
quaint
and
the
colourful
her
picture
i
often
find
disquiet
for
the
most
part
as
promise
she
steer
clear
of
the
few
city
and
big
town
the
countryside
she
chose
look
mostly
prehistoric
the

something
about
the

of
the

at

the

she
use

it

if

the

of
the

as
she
wander
around
nova
scotia
she
would
have
see
close
up
that
pure
unadulterated
hope
be
hard
to
find
in
the
s
from
there
on
in
when
immigrant
land
in

it
might
have
be
by

in

but
they
quickly
hopped
on
a

and
head
west
jumping
off
in
the
heart
of
the
country
in

or
quebec
or
continue
on
to
the

british
columbia
that

divide
place
into
have
and
have
nots
during
the
spirit
sap
great
depression
people
move
and
move
again
in
search
of
work
and
an
ascendant
narrative
many
of
them
come
from
town
in
the
old
country
and
after
a
brief
interval
in
the
wilderness
aspire
to
return
to
town
and
village
once
again
for
some
place
it
be
a
gradual
upwards
or
downwards
spiral
for
others
the
change
be
more
precipitous
as
these
thing
tend
to
be
any
way
i
look
at
it
i
can
t
think
of
these
as
the
good
year
the
men
on
both
side
of
our
family
toil
mile
under
the
ground
or
in
the
fiery
hell
of
the
steel
mill
before
head
off
to
fight
for
our
freedom
on
faraway
soil
and
the
shipping
laneways
of
the
north
atlantic
my
father
mercifully
avoid
service
in
world
war
ii
but
only
because
like
per
cent
of
young
nova
scotian
male
he
and
his
brother
have
contract
tuberculosis
a
disease
that
particularly
afflict
the
coal
and
steel
town
of
cape
breton
which
have
more
than
their
share
of
malnourish
folk
living
in
small
poorly
ventilate
overcrowd
home
i
ve
see
a
picture
of
where
he
spent
eighteen
month
of
his
life
when
he
should
have
be
out
play
basketball
at
the
knox
church
hall
in
glace
bay
bird
dog
chick
down
at
senator
s
corner
or
throw
rock
at
the
catholic
from
saint
mike
s
bath
in
sunlight
the
glace
bay
sanatorium
look
like
a
school
two
storey
with
a
white
wooden
exterior
slop
roof
and
brick
chimney
a
church
steeple
off
in
the
background
but
i
think
i
can
see
face
in
the
window
the
ghost
of
kid
like
my
father
and
his
brother
who
endure
a
procedure
in
which
inert
air
be
inject
into
the
area
around
the
diseased
lung
but
which
sound
far
well
than
the
other
common
tb
treatment
of
the
day
commonly
know
as
rib
because
it
involve
have
several
rib
surgically
remove
in
order
to
collapse
the
stricken
lung
in
the
hope
it
would
recover
i
don
t
think
i
m
drawn
to
gloom
but
i
m
haunt
by
the
picture
that
i
ve
see
from
these
year
when
photographic
studio
seem
to
be
opening
up
in
every
small
town
throughout
the
province
i
don
t
know
where
lawson
hardy
who
be
first
a
cooper
and
then
a
merchant
before
opening
a
photographic
studio
above
a
former
candy
store
in
kentville
get
his
training
or
even
what
georgia
harriet
cunningham
a
daughter
of
a
saddler
and
justice
of
the
peace
do
before
she
bought
a
studio
in
bridgetown
my
guess
be
that
helen
creighton
the
great
folklorist
who
travel
the
province
through
these
year
capture
the
old
people
and
way
in
photograph
sound
recording
and
move
picture
be
self
taught
i
do
know
that
our
most
famous
photographer
from
this
period
wallace
macaskill
study
in
new
york
in
his
studio
in
glace
bay
and
later
halifax
he
learn
to
produce
the
soft
focus
impressionism
that
be
the
hallmark
of
his
marine
and
landscape
image
his
well
know
picture
of
the
fabled
race
schooner
bluenose
and
the
province
s
coastal
fishing
village
already
fading
into
the
romanticize
past
i
see
no
such
sentimentality
in
a
picture
of
the
most
famous
citizen
from
weymouth
fall
photographer
unknown
which
sits
in
the
nova
scotia
archive
alongside
a
huge
collection
of
macaskill
s
work
and
clara
dennis
s
picture
the
campbell
boy
would
have
be
just
kid
when
sam
langford
at
twelve
left
the
hardscrabble
black
community
just
outside
of
weymouth
for
boston
one
day
langford
walk
into
a
drugstore
own
by
a
hustler
name
sam
woodman
who
also
operate
a
small
fight
gym
before
long
the
broad
round
face
of
the
boston
tar
baby
as
langford
be
know
in
those
enlighten
time
be
plaster
on
kid
trading
card
matchbox
cigarette
package
american
sport
page
and
the
cover
of
french
magazine
the
fight
writer
of
the
time
say
there
be
never
a
well
fighter
pound
for
pound
than
the
five
foot
eight
inch
langford
i
take
as
gospel
the
word
of
the
brawler
jack
dempsey
who
say
he
fear
no
man
but
be
afraid
of
sam
langford
who
in
his
prime
be
nearly
fifty
pound
lighter
than
the
world
heavyweight
champion
there
be
a
predictable
arc
to
fighter
life
langford
s
because
of
what
might
have
be
be
sadder
than
most
when
he
take
on
the
most
punish
prize
fighter
on
the
planet
the
big
strong
jack
johnson
langford
lose
but
the
fight
be
close
enough
that
the
great
johnson
saw
no
money
to
be
make
in
two
black
boxer
pummel
each
other
and
refuse
to
give
langford
a
rematch
so
he
spent
the
rest
of
his
career
wander
fight
for
lesser
title
and
small
purse
throughout
europe
and
south
america
he
be
fat
and
legally
blind
when
he
won
the
heavyweight
championship
of
spain
in
mexico
city
in
at
age
no
one
knew
precisely
how
many
hundred
of
bout
langford
have
fought
when
he
retire
penniless
everything
i
d
read
lead
me
to
believe
that
he
have
disappear
during
the
rest
of
the
s
and
s
then
i
saw
this
photograph
in
the
nova
scotia
archive
from
the
collection
of
a
sportsman
name
tom
connors
thought
to
be
take
sometime
between
and
in
it
you
can
see
langford
s
cauliflower
left
ear
and
his
blind
man
s
squint
the
great
fighter
have
grandmotherly
arm
his
as
as
they
say
in
some
place
in
nova
scotia
be
eight
axe
handle
wide
it
must
have
be
cold
when
the
picture
be
take
because
he
s
sport
an
unflattering
dark
leotard
so
be
the
white
guy
crouch
across
from
him
a
leaner
young
specimen
name
joe
hartnet
work
be
scarce
for
everyone
in
s
nova
scotia
yet
i
still
find
it
so
achingly
sad
to
think
of
a
warrior
like
langford
broke
and
blind
travel
the
maritimes
as
part
of
the
bill
lynch
carnival
show
every
day
or
two
they
go
from
depression
era
town
to
depression
era
town
there
wear
glove
as
big
as
pillow
langford
would
move
his
fat
broken
body
the
account
from
the
halifax
herald
say
he
look
like
a
huge
rubber
ball
around
the
makeshift
ring
as
the
calliope
played
and
the
local
try
to
forget
their
own
woe
stomp
and
whistle
he
would
slip
hartnet
s
punch
occasionally
throw
one
of
two
of
his
own
the
herald
s
reporter
note
that
he
paid
close
attention
to
the
timer
when
a
bell
rang
the
great
sam
langford
who
have
fought
in
the
ring
with
as
much
skill
and
bravery
as
any
man
before
or
since
would
trudge
to
his
corner
he
would
sit
down
on
his
stool
look
out
into
the
crowd
that
to
his
eye
would
be
nothing
but
shape
and
shade
and
wait
for
the
bell
to
ring
again

like
the
carnies
from
the
bill
lynch
show
i
ve
meander
all
across
this
province
stop
when
i
felt
like
it
turn
in
here
or
there
for
no
good
reason
at
all
go
down
some
old
back
road
just
because
when
you
do
that
it
s
easy
to
imagine
a
time
when
hand
cranked
car
still
clanked
and
wheeze
down
nova
scotia
s
twenty
mile
of
pave
road
and
when
most
traveller
here
like
most
people
everywhere
get
around
on
passenger
train
which
stop
not
just
in
big
spot
like
windsor
weymouth
digby
kentville
and
sydney
but
brought
men
in
hat
and
woman
in
their
sunday
best
to
and
from
station
in
tiny
place
like
paradise
plympton
saulnierville
and
wilmot
that
have
already
begin
to
recede
into
history
it
s
even
easy
to
see
the
landscape
near
the
midpoint
of
the
twentieth
century
when
almost
half
of
the
province
s
people
still
live
somewhere
outside
of
an
urban
area
which
then
meant
a
thrive
metropolis
of
one
thousand
people
nova
scotia
in
the
postwar
year
be
already
start
to
resemble
the
nova
scotia
i
drive
through
in
if
you
look
hard
desert
homestead
could
be
glimpse
slowly
go
down
the
road
to
ruin
empty
window
frame
bulge
roof
sag
barn
return
to
the
earth
at
a
glacial
pace
in
some
case
whole
hamlet
seem
to
be
here
one
day
and
go
the
next
when
timber
price
collapse

sell

spark
a

i
suppose
put
mabou
on
the

in
john

perhaps
more
than
the

checked
into

even
try

one
where
the
atmosphere
tonight
resemble
a
wake
i
hung
around
for
a

on
so
sombre
a
night
i
couldn

bring
myself
to
ask
the
usual
journalistic
question
about
what
a
person
s
life
have
meant
when
i
d
see
and

enough
i

be
inside

with
the

there

anything
the

whether
there
be
some
kind
of
eulogy
such
thing

approval
at

wood
of
his

it

in

can
if

of
the
glencoe

the
final
tune
at
the
funeral
of
any

wide
against

down
at
the

and
the

black
as
a

that
when
my

it
would
happen
in
a
gentler
way

it
have
for

a
nine

at
the

that
i
have
ever
call
home
my
voice
be
a
tuneless
croak
now
discordant
enough
to
make
the
dog
slink
from
the

through
place
with
old
country
name
i
sang

when
i

i
fill

the

the

be
after
some
early
fit

i
have
found
something
suitable

who
could
not

when
i
take
a
job
in

i
held
the

away
from
my

and
yell
fuck
yes
when
the
magazine
s
national
editor
call
me
at
home
to
say
the
gig
be
mine
even
if
the
bureau
be
just
me
and
i
be
suppose
to
write
about
all
four
atlantic
province
that
meant
a
story
every
couple
of
month
in
new
brunswick
and
even
less
often
in
prince
edward
island
with
the
population
of
toronto
s
small
borough
newfoundland
because
i
be
so
smitten
by
it
i
visit
as
often
as
the
bureau
budget
could
manage
it
mostly
i
stayed
in
nova
scotia
a
place
where
editor
in
toronto
have
few
preconceive
notion
about
what
need
to
be
cover
leave
me
to
write
pretty
much
about
what
i
want
it
be
harder
way
harder
than
i
thought
it
would
be
it
always
be
for
any
reporter
who
ever
have
to
write
about
their
home
particularly
when
it
be
a
place
they
love
even
if
it
be
with
a
righteous
indignation
i
want
nova
scotia
to
match
the
vision
i
have
of
it
when
i
live
thousand
of
mile
away
and
make
my
daily
bread
write
about
businessmen
who
wore
suit
that
be
worth
more
than
the
use
toyota
corolla
we
d
bought
from
a
dodgy
dealer
in
the
halifax
suburb
back
then
i
use
to
literally
dream
of
nova
scotia
its
moulder
sea
stink
and
incessant
damp
its
building
hunch
like
a
linebacker
s
shoulder
against
the
element
its
people
with
their
mishmash
of
enterprise
humanity
and
grit
my
kind
of
people
i
would
tell
myself
sit
across
from
a
bond
trader
with
a
pinky
ring
in
an
eatery
in
toronto
s
financial
district
people
who
manage
who
do
what
have
to
be
do
the
first
time
i
hit
the
road
as
a
big
shot
magazine
writer
in
my
home
province
it
be
january
and
i
be
bound
for
a
fishing
village
that
boom
back
when
it
have
multiple
plant
to
process
cod
and
lobster
and
big
ship
docked
there
to
take
lumber
and
salt
cod
to
the
west
indie
then
the
fish
that
first
brought
john
cabot
to
these
part
disappear
due
to
overfishing
the
warm
ocean
and
regulatory
incompetence
ottawa
step
in
to
save
the
big
seafood
company
from
failure
but
there
be
only
so
much
a
government
could
do
eventually
one
of
those
big
fishing
concern
shutter
its
only
plant
in
lockeport
where
it
be

she
say
it
be
no
one
s
idea
of
a
dream

but
there
wasn
t
much
else
in
her
town
where
people
start
to
hit
the
bottle
prescription
drug
and
increasingly
each
other
as
the
money
ran
out
ferguson
who
be
solid
and
straightforward
told
me
about
how

and
how
after
her
ten
week
of
severance
pay
come
to
an
end
she
sank
into
depression
then
somehow

around

what

today
would
he

a

with
an

no

which
they
do
eleven
month
later
dump
cameron

be
there
the
night
that
happen

in
the

go
to
john

full
of
people
who
be
resolutely

a
revolt
within

marked
the

to
try

anything
truly

how

saw
from

look
back
towards

be
colder

man
who
have
not

in

very
long
time
knew
the

from
the
halifax
explosion
be
out
there
still
rise
into
the

another
day
around

in

increasingly
centralize
world
it
be
something
i
thought
and
write
a
lot
about
i
thought
about
it
for
sure
one
summer
day
sunset
approach
as
i
prepared
to
wade
out
up
to
my
knee
in
a
cape
breton
river
where
generation
of
demonts
have
swum
and
cast
for
trout
there
wasn
t
the
hint
of
a
breeze
as
i
deposit
my
mother
s
and
father
s
ash
which
have
be
stand
for
a
long
time
on
a
shelf
in
my
house
in
halifax
into
the
water
at
first
the
grey
dust
just
float
there
on
the
surface
after
a
couple
of
minute
what
be
left
of
russell
and
joan
demont
slowly
converge
as
have
their
life
and
the
long
narrative
of
their
two
family
in
this
unlikely
place
that
they
never
lose
faith
in
another
day
i
go
for
a
drive
in
the
countryside
far
from
the
mira
river
i
hadn
t
read
a
word
he
have
write
in
a
long
time
but
that
didn
t
mean
joe
howe
be
ever
really
far
from
my
mind
i
use
to
imagine
his
horse
clip
clop
into
a
clearing
as
i
stood
on
a
hill
look
down
on
some
town
that
be
probably
on
the
rise
in
his
day
i
see
him
slap
the
front
of
his
jacket
after
dismount
so
that
the
dust
from
his
travel
float
upwards
and
then
run
a
hand
through
his
finger
in
the
light
socket
hair
howe
would
have
have
no
qualm
about
offering
a
hand
finger
ink
stain
from
the
previous
night
s
write
to
a
stranger
and
then
just
see
where
the
conversation
go
there
would
be
no
awkward
pause
with
a
man
willing
to
debate
for
eight
straight
hour
if
the
subject
interested
him
he
would
have
spoken
as
he
usually
do
in
speech
begin
slowly
by
make
some
reference
to
local
history
or
tradition
about
which
his
knowledge
seem
inexhaustible
and
then
subtly
elevate
the
discussion
to
some
loftier
plane
as
he
do
in
the
very
first
address
before
the
halifax
mechanic
institute
he
might
have
give
voice
to
his
dream
that
in
time
the
contrast
between
nova
scotia
and
her
neighbor
will
be
less
strike
the
evidence
of
their
superiority
less
dishearten
and
distinct
he
might
have
express
his
firm
belief
that
if
every
nova
scotian
work
together
this
province
shall
be
a
synonym
for
high
mental
and
moral
cultivation
that
the
sound
of
its
name
in
a
briton
s
ear
shall
be
follow
by
the
reflection
that
the
good
seed
which
he
have
sow
have
fall
upon
genial
soil
and
that
an
american
cast
his
eye
over
the
map
of
this
mighty
continent
shall
recognize
in
the
little
peninsula
jutting
out
upon
the
bosom
of
the
atlantic
the
home
of
a
race
superior
to
many
and
second
to
none
of
the
countless
tribe
by
whose
gigantic
territory
they
be
embrace
in
this
scene
i
imagine
howe
would
have
stood
there
know
full
well
that
what
he
have
hop
for
in
when
nova
scotia
be
still
in
what
he
call
the
infant
hour
hadn
t
come
to
pas
there
be
sad
place
to
see
as
i
wander
around
as
his
surrogate
along
with
scene
that
i
would
never
in
a
hundred
year
understand
yet
poem
also
unfolded
right
there
before
my
very
eye
like
a
man
who
probably
wouldn
t
get
this
chance
again
i
look
hard
at
the
people
i
saw
as
i
travel
the
horny
hand
men
and
woman
work
close
to
the
land
the
politician
with
hope
in
their
heart
the
effervescent
small
town
merchant
the
young
men
linger
at
the
service
station
way
out
in
the
country
the
old
woman
hair
as
immovable
as
porcelain
walk
out
to
the
road
to
get
her
paper
from
the
mail
box
in
the
place
where
she
have
live
her
entire
life
my
admiration
be
deep
for
them
as
it
be
for
the
acadian
fight
for
cultural
survival
the
mi
kmaq
and
black
people
just
battling
for
a
chance
the
pasty
face
celt
like
myself
who
have
also
hung
in
make
this
place
what
it
be
sometimes
people
from
away
usually
free
marketer
who
like
to
look
at
thing
as
line
in
a
balance
sheet
ask
me
what
the
future
be
for
nova
scotia
the
truth
be
that
after
all
of
this
reading
and
travel
and
interview
i
don

t
go
far
in
life
i
live
across
the
street
from
an
elementary
school
where
i
be
an
underperform
student
a
couple
of
block
from
the
field
where
i
played
touch
football
with
friend
who
be
now
dead
a
few
minute
away
from
the
house
where
i
kiss
a
girl
for
the
very
first
time
when
i
be
a
young
boy
before
i
really
knew
anything
about
nova
scotia
its
story
and
my
people
s
place
in
it
i
use
to
like
to
wander
around
much
as
i
do
today
even
then
i
have
a
sense
that
my
small
bit
of
this
small
city
have
multiple
world
and
that
i
have
company
as
i
travel
i
ve
felt
this
way
as
long
as
i
remember
even
though
after
all
this
time
i
still
struggle
to
explain
what
exactly
i
feel
let
alone
why
i
can
recall
for
example
a
winter
back
in
the
day
when
the
snowdrift
seem
so
much
high
than
they
be
now
even
though
i
know
that
wasn
t
the
case
i
guess
because
we
be
so
small
after
supper
some
accomplice
and
i
would
crawl
into
a
partially
built
house
block
from
my
house
on
the
wonderfully
name
bliss
street
we
didn
t
do
much
in
there
just
hammer
a
few
nail
and
stole
the
occasional
piece
of
lumber
to
reinforce
the
board
in
a
backyard
hockey
rink
when
i
walk
by
the
house
that
stand
there
now

high

and
wood
above
often
with
a
gleam

the

have
climbed
the

the

a
century
earlier
have
be
