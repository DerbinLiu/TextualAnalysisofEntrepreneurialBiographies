he
put

it

musica
that

trigger
an
old
memory
a
check
of
the

show
that
walter

s
father
have
many
year
before
red

the
comment
that

a
rueful
weinberg
say
all
i
know
be
that
the
figure
of
the
crude
drug
department
show
that
it
be
do
a
splendid
and
profitable
business
his
self
appraisal
i
just
wasn
t
very
bright
during
an
emergency
meeting
of
the
mckesson
director
news
come
that
musica
have
commit
suicide
weinberg
didn
t
miss
a
beat
let
s
fire
him
for
his
sin
anyway
apparently
weinberg
learn
his
lesson
accord
to
george
doty
later
a
partner
of
goldman
sachs
sidney
could
and
would
smell
a
rat
a
mile
away
sidney
weinberg
s
fond
word
be
integrity
he
virtually
worship
that
word
and
what
it
meant
for
him
honesty
and
put
customer
interest
first
mistake
be
quite
forgivable
but
dishonesty
be
unpardonable
he
be
a
loom
presence
and
mr
integrity
if
ever
a
question
of
ethic
come
up
it
would
be
described
as
a
sidney
weinberg
question
the
real
culture
of
goldman
sachs
trace
back
to
sidney
weinberg
say
al
feld
who
work
at
the
firm
for
more
than
fifty
year
tough
as
nail
he
held
the
firm
on
the
straight
and
narrow
path
of
very
high
ethic
and
true
fellowship
throughout
goldman
sachs
be
a
total
meritocracy
mr
weinberg
tolerate
none
of
the
politics
or
infighting
that
hurt
so
many
of
the
other
firm
and
the
key
to
there
be
no
political
game
be
the
omnipotence
of
sidney
weinberg
who
be
tough
and
endow
with
tremendous
energy
one
use
of
that
power
be
to
keep
payouts
to
partner
low
force
them
to
build
up
equity
in
the
firm
sidney
weinberg
set
the
policy
on
tough
capital
retention
say
partner
peter
sacerdote
it
be
good
for
the
firm
because
it
make
everyone
focus
always
on
what
be
best
for
goldman
sachs
as
a
whole
firm
and
it
be
good
for
the
individual
partner
because
it
kept
you
financially
modest
you
couldn
t
get
into
fancy
spending
habit
because
you
didn

with
their

a
crude
and
rough

another

nothing
like

next
one
the
hopkins

notorious
as
the
large
of

it
be
virtually
impossible
to
get
that
number
change

another
listing
this
reality
would
be
weinberg
s
fulcrum
and
the
reputation
of
the
hopkins

be
his
archimedes

both
arm
with
clever
imagination

fortunately
a
pal

tipped
cabot
that

all
a
joke
so
cabot
kept

still
have
the
treasure

cabot
told
his
secretary
to
say
he
be
too
busy
cabot
s
secretary

insists
so
cabot
picked
up

to
be

luckily
knudsen
knew
of

s
joke
so
they

a
good
laugh
together
and
cabot
flew
home
to
boston
for
the
weekend
he
have
a
fantastic
nose
for
who
be
honest
and
who
be
not
quite
so
good
say
cabot
of
his
friend
plus
he
have
that
great
sense
of
humor
the
peak
of
weinberg
s
irreverence
during
world
war
ii
may
have
be
achieve
when
admiral
darlan
the
senior
vichy
french
naval
officer
and
a
politically
powerful
haughty
and
ambitious
man
know
to
have
nazi
sympathy
be
at
the
white
house
be
court
with
attentive
protocol
by
the
ally
for
political
reason
when
it
be
time
to
leave
weinberg
reach
into
his
pocket
as
he
come
to
the
front
door
pull
out
a
quarter
and
hand
it
to
the
resplendently
uniformed
admiral
say
here
boy
get
me
a
cab
cabot
introduce
weinberg
to
his
patrician
friend
and
they
get
along
famously
often
sail
on
summer
cruise
in
the
cold
water
off
maine
despite
his
navy
service
weinberg
knew
nothing
about
sail
and
never
learn
how
to
swim
on
one
occasion
oblige
by
his
companion
to
jump
into
the
cold
water
because
all
hand
be
require
to
wash
at
least
once
each
day
weinberg
prudently
tie
one
end
of
a
long
rope
to
the
mast
and
the
other
around
his
waist
before
he
climbed
carefully
down
the
boat
s
ladder
into
the
sea
cabot
quickly
untie
the
line
from
the
mast
joyfully
toss
it
into
the
water
where
weinberg
in
a
bulky
life
preserver
struggle
to
stay
afloat
cabot
and
weinberg
both
love
dirty
joke
which
they
delighted
in
tell
each
other
in
their
regular
telephone
call
in
their
later
year
both
be
lose
their
hearing
and
cabot
s
proper
bostonian
secretary
be
so
offend
when
overhear
cabot
s
end
of
those
scatological
call
that
she
insist
cabot
close
the
door
when
weinberg
s
call
come
in
to
accommodate
her
request
but
know
such
offend
call
come
in
quite
often
cabot
found
a
clever
solution
a
foot
pedal
under
his
desk
that
would
automatically
close
the
door
cabot
have
occasion
to
learn
that
weinberg
while
widely
respect

down
at

which
be
in
every
sense
of
the

aggressive

even
transcend
the

it

this
complimentary
find
the
lawsuit
cost
the
firm
dearly
million
in
legal
expense
but
it
be
worth
it
to
be
include
while
the
firm
be
just
barely
a
member
of
the
club
it
clearly
have
a
long
long
way
to
go
weinberg
have
no
intention
of
remain
just
a
member
of
the
club
he
be
determine
to
be
important
all
the
prestige
client
of
goldman
sachs
be
not
firm
client
they
be
the
personal
client
of
sidney
weinberg
say
al
feld
and
those
core
client
be
crucial
for
example
what
get
the
firm
into
other
firm
syndicate
be
our
ability
to
trade
position
in
their

for
position
in
our
syndicate
which
be
really
mr
weinberg
s
syndicate
mr
weinberg
s
business
be
his
business
and
he
brook
no
interference
he
be
rough
and
knew
how
to
be
tough
with
others
he
once
give
an
ultimatum
that
no
one
else
could
have
give
to
the
sears
roebuck

he
be
not
pleased
with
the
way
lehman
brother
have
be
conduct
itself
and
put
the
matter
bluntly
either
they
go
or
i
go
lehman
brother
go
during
his
era
from
to
weinberg
exercise
control
over
goldman
sachs
by
force
of
will
and
personality
by
his
stand
within
the
firm
by
his
stature
in
the
outside
world
particularly
in
washington
because
he
be
by
far
the
large
percentage
partner
and
because
he
alone
decide
who
would
become
a
partner
and
once
every
two
year
he
alone
decide
the

the
other

stanley
miller
look
at
the
list
and
couldn
t
find
his
name
it
wasn
t
there
so
weinberg
give
miller
a
piece
of
his
own
participation
a
far
reason
for
weinberg
s
dominance
be
that
he
be
a
director
of
so
many
corporation
over
time
serve
on

so
clearly
mr

goldman
sachs
at
the
waldorf
astoria
he
take
it
right
to

table
because
after
all
he
be
mr
goldman
sachs
mr
weinberg
felt
very
strongly
about
make
no

he
do
not
want

most
important
transaction

the
firm
s
relationship
with
its
most
important
client
for
many
year
originate
in
a
very
personal
way
the
young
ceo
of
the
large
privately
own
business
in
the
world
have
a
special
friendship
with
goldman
sachs
s
senior
partner
that
relationship
be
improbable
they
be
different
in
age
religion
wealth
social
stand
and
personal
value
but
they
have
both
be
in

and
one
of
them
sidney
weinberg
knew
everyone
from
political
and
military
leader
to
showgirl
and
he
knew
how
to
make
connection
the
ford
motor
company
be
built
as
an
increasingly
gigantic
proprietorship
by
henry
ford
a
notorious
anti
semite
who
would
never
have
be
willing
to
rely
on
a
jewish
financier
after
henry
ford
s
death
his
son
edsel
become
ceo
but
when
edsel
die
six
month
later
the
title
pass
to
his
thirty
five
year
old
son
henry
ford
ii
young
henry
s
principal
distinction
to
that
date
may
have
be
get
dismiss
from
yale
not
only
for
have
his
term
paper
write
by
a
commercial
agency
but
also
for
be
so
casual
about
academic
standard
as
to
have
carelessly
left
the
agency
s
invoice
inside
a
paper
s
cover
at
yale
ford
bought
suit
of
clothes
a
dozen
at
a
time
have
them
deliver
to
his
dormitory
room
and
when
told
the
closet
be
already
full
say
just
take
out
as
many
as
you
put
in
and
do
whatever
you
want
with
them
arguably
the
best
thing
young
ford
do
before
become
ceo
be
to
make
friend
at
the
war
production
board
with
a
man
who
be
twenty
five
year
old
and
really
knew
his
way
around
sidney
weinberg
when
young
henry
suddenly
become
ceo
the
ford

enormous

a
leader
in

financial
management
and
sidney
weinberg
a
real
influence
at
ford
one
day
john
whitehead
who
be
then
work
as
an
assistant
to
weinberg
ask
do
you
think
ford
will
ever
go
public
no
say
weinberg
but
take
ford
public
would
certainly
be
a
great
coup
little
do
either
know
that
their
brief
exchange
would
soon
lead
to
one
of
the
most
important
transaction
on
wall
street
ford
be
a
very
private
company
and
everything
financial
be
kept
secret
but
whitehead
begin
to
think
that
there
must
be
some
financial
information
somewhere
and
he
start
search
for
it
sure
enough
the
commonwealth
of
massachusetts
have
a
law
require
any
company
do
business
there
to
register
and
file
a
balance
sheet
at
the
state
department
of
commerce
so
people
could
get
basic
information
about
any
company
with
which
they
might
do
business
since
ford
do
business
in
the
commonwealth
and
could
get
no
exception
to
the
rule
ford
have
to
file
whitehead
take
the
train
to
boston
search
the
file
and
locate
ford
s
single
page
filing
it
be
the
ford
motor
company
s
balance
sheet
weinberg
and
whitehead
take
a
long
look
ford
be
not
just
big
it
be
huge
in
asset
and
have
few
liability
indeed
it
be
the
large
privately
own
company
in
the
world
however
as
weinberg
and
whitehead
would
later
find
out
when
the
ford
family
not
the
corporation
give
them
a
look
at
the
financials
large
as
it
be
ford
motor
company
be
not
profitable
the
ford
family
have
be
shock
to
learn
that
old
mr
ford
have
decide
just
before
his
death
to
save
on
estate
tax
by
create
the
ford
foundation
fund
with
percent
of
ford
motor
company
s
common
stock
with
percent
own
by
ford
director
officer
and
employee
only
percent
would
pas
on
to
family
member
but
this
percent
would
hold
percent
of
the
voting
right
so
the
family
still
have
complete
control
the
ford
foundation
finance
committee
chair
by
yet
another
of
weinberg
s
many
close
friend
charles
e
wilson
chairman
of
general
electric
be
in
an
untenable
situation
ford
stock
paid
no
dividend
so
the
foundation
could
not
make
grant
equally
important
the
trustee
sensibly
believe
that
prudence
require
them
to
diversify
the
foundation
s
endowment
so
they
be
determine
to
sell
a
large
block
of
ford
stock
in
a
public
offering
and
have
ford
list
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
the
exchange
however
require
all
list
stock
to
have
voting
right
and
pay
dividend
which
the
family
oppose
family
member
be
all
on
the
ford
payroll
at
handsome
salary
so
they
have
no
need
for
even
more
income
through
dividend
in
addition
to
these
strong
difference
the
internal
revenue
service
would
have
to
agree
to
make
a
special
private
ruling
that
the
benefit
presumably
paid
in
additional
share
that
the
family
would
receive
in
exchange
for
give
up
absolute
voting
control
would
not
be
subject
to
taxation
otherwise
the
family
would
never
agree
as
both
side
would
soon
learn
there
be
one
more
potential
conflict
both
the
foundation
and
the
family
intend
to
retain
the
same
expert
adviser
sidney
weinberg
weinberg
may
have
be
the
small
important
man
on
wall
street
physically
but
it
do
not
matter
he
be
at
the
height
of
his
personal
power
and
stature
goldman
sachs
may
have
be
a
small
second
tier
firm
with
little
experience
in
manage
underwriting
syndicate
but
it
do
not
matter
it
be
sidney
weinberg
s
firm
the
issue
be
whether
weinberg
would
represent
the
ford
foundation
or
the
ford
family
the
foundation
s
finance
committee
have
thought
it
wise
to
retain
an
expert
adviser
for
an
operation
that
be
so
large
and
complex
over
the
year
charles
e
wilson
have
become
acquaint
with
practically
all
the
shrewdest
money
men
in
the
country
and
there
be
no
question
in
his
mind
about
which
one
of
them
he
want
as
the
foundation
s
adviser
i
want
sidney
weinberg
when
wilson
told
young
henry
ford
who
be
also
the
chairman
of
the
foundation
that
he
plan
to
enlist
weinberg
as
his
adviser
ford
promptly
block
that
idea
you
can
t
have
him
sidney
be
financial
adviser
to
the
family
the
family
get
weinberg
and
the
foundation
get
three
other
adviser
as
e
j
kahn
observe
in
his
new
yorker
profile
of
weinberg
that
both
of
the
principal
party
involve
in
the
nation
s
most
impressive
stock
offering
want
the
service
of
the
same
individual

no
surprise
to
people
familiar
with
the
individual
sidney
james

long

fortunately
there

but
the
secret
that
ford
and
weinberg
be
up
to
something
be
kept
until
weinberg
met
with
henry

and
several
other
member
of
the

at
palm
beach
in
march
after

all
one
day
weinberg

at
a
large

pierce
by
a

who
notice
the

when
ford
guide
weinberg
to
the
table
of
the
duke
and
duchess
of
windsor
as
weinberg
later
observe
how
could
you
keep
anything
confidential
under
those
condition
the
ford
offering
be
certain
to
be
the
define

of
the
postwar
era
in

every

banker
want
a
major

weinberg
shrewdly
position
himself
to
control
participation
in
the

even
though
the
foundation
be
the
actual
seller
and
well
respect
blyth
co
the
nominal
lead

most
important
weinberg
carefully
arrange
everything
so
that
he
would
personally
be
understood
to
be
make
all
the
key
selection
of
the
specific
firm
to
be
give
the
lucrative
and
prestigious
position
as
the
principal
underwriter
he
have
want
few
underwriter
but
ford
want
more
so
in
a
compromise
weinberg
determine
that
seven
be
the
appropriate
number
of
lead
underwriter
an
elite

of
course
goldman
sachs
h
nearly
one

while
some
of

might
have
argue
that
seven
lead
underwriter
be
really
too
many
they
knew
all
too
well
that
if
they
ever
complain
weinberg
be
weinberg
would
make
certain
that
their
firm
whichever
firm
it
might
be
would
be
take
out
of
the
lucrative

altogether
every

underwriter
soon
understood
that
sidney
weinberg
intend
to
achieve
two
simultaneous
objective
first
to
put
together
the
strong
possible

so
the
ford
family
and
the
ford
foundation
would
get
the
best
possible
price
and
second
to
ensure
a
major
advance
in
the
stature
of
goldman
sachs
among
underwriter
as
he
chose
each
of
the
lead
underwriter
for
one
of
the
covet
lucrative
slot
weinberg
make
sure
its
leader
knew
where
this
opportunity
come
from
and
understood
what
reciprocal
business

to
come
after
one
of
the
many

the

when
henry

what

a

until
everything

over
and
then
let
the

decide
what
his
effort
be
really
worth

more
than
the
actual
fee
weinberg
always
say
he
appreciate
an
affectionate
handwritten
letter
he
receive
from
ford
which
say
along
with
other
flatter
thing
without
you
it
could
not
have
be
accomplish
weinberg
have
the
letter
frame
and
hung
in
his
office
where
he
would
proudly
direct
visitor
attention
to
it
say
that
s
the
big
payoff
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
he
be
speak
more
literally
than
his
guest
knew
the
fee
finally
paid
be
estimate
at
the
time
to
be
as
high
as
a
million
dollar
the
actual
fee
be
nowhere
near
that
amount
for
two
year
work
and
a
dazzle
success
the
indispensable
man
be
paid
only
deeply
disappointed
sidney
weinberg
never
mention
the
amount
in
fact
the
fee
be
not
really
important
in
the
overall
picture
weinberg
soon
become
a
director
of
the
ford
motor
company
and
take
his
pal
paul
cabot
onto
the
board
with
him
and
for
nearly
half
a
century
ford
would
be
goldman
sachs
s
most
prestigious
investment
banking
client
even
more
important
sidney
weinberg
use
the
ford
motor
company
underwriting
to
leapfrog
his
firm
s
stand
on
wall
street
into
the
top
tier
of
underwriter
strongly
position
as
a
major
firm
that
others
have
to
treat
well
the
continue
stream
of
ford
financing
expect
over
the
follow
decade
could
be
share
and
trade
with
others
to
keep
goldman
sachs
in
that
top
tier
though
a
major
success
for
weinberg
and
his
firm
the
ford
underwriting
be
a
dud
for
many
investor
offer
at
the
share
jumped
to
seventy
dollar
by
the
end
of
the
first
day
s
trading
a
clear
clean
underwriting
triumph
but
then
over
several
month
the
price
drift
down
into
the
forty
the
problem
both
the
initial
sharp
price
rise
and
the
subsequent
fall
be
due
to
ford
s
insistence
on
allocate
over
percent
of
the
share
to
ford
dealer
in
the
initial
excitement
around
the
ipo
many
dealer
rush
to
buy
still
more
share
later
remember
that
they
have
huge
bank
debt
to
finance
their
inventory
of
car
most
dealer
felt
oblige
to
sell
and
as
the
price
fell
other
dealer
rush
to
sell
their
share
too
believe
it
be
always
in
an
issuer
s
long
term
interest
for
investor
to
make
a
profit
weinberg
insist
when
ford
subsequently
borrow
one
hundred
million
dollar
in
bond
that
the
yield
be
set
slightly
above
the
market
say
that
ford
could
not
afford
to
have
another
poor
performer
in
the
aftermarket
not
long
after
the
record
ford
equity
underwriting
weinberg
do
a
record
bond
underwriting
a
million
issue
for
sears
roebuck
it
be
then
the
large
public
debt
offering
ever
make
the
issue
be
float
in
a
bond
market
that
be
so
soft
that
professional
at
other
firm
have
doubt
it
could
sell
at
all
but
the
issue
be
a
success
right
after
the
sears
bond
come
a
three
hundred
million
dollar
bond
issue
for
general
electric
comanaged
with
morgan
stanley
goldman
sachs
be
move
up
in
the
rank
and
be
arguably
now
one
of
wall
street
s
top
ten
ford
be
for
many
year
certainly
the
firm
s
most
important
client
in
prestige
but
not
in
business
volume
after
the
ipo
ford
do
no
long
term
financing
because
young
henry
ford
rely
entirely
on
sidney
weinberg
for
financial
advice
and
weinberg
be
sure
that
interest
rate
would
decline
so
he
flatly
oppose
use
any
new
long
term
debt
any
borrowing
would
have
to
be
do
with
commercial
paper
unfortunately
weinberg
be
wrong
about
interest
rate
his
control
of
ford
finance
so
angered
ed
lundy
ford
s
brilliant
cfo
that
when
weinberg
die
most
ford
executive
want
to

and
don
gant
the
partner
cover
the
ford
account
for
many
year
under
weinberg
be
warn
that
they
would
have
to
compete
for
any
future
business
and
that
they
would
begin
that
competition
several
yard
behind
the
start
line
while
gant
be
successful
at
rebuild
the
relationship
ford
be
so
successful
in
the
fifty
and
sixty
that
financing
and
the
service
of
goldman
sachs
be
seldom
need
underwriting
wasn
t
the
only
area
in
which
sidney
weinberg
set
the
pace
for
goldman
sachs
he
be
also
an
active
innovator
in
give
merger
advice
as
john
whitehead
recall
with
admiration
the
first
time
goldman
sachs
charge
a
fee
for
m
a
advice
be
to
all
of
us
in
the
firm
at
the
time
stun
naturally
it
be
sidney
weinberg
who
brought
in
the
business
through
his
remarkable
network
he
knew
both
jerry
lambert
and
william
warner
and
that
enable
him
to
bring
them
together
in
a
merger
as
warner
lambert
pharmaceutical
the
fee
be
quite
impressive
in
those
day
most
investment
banker
get
paid
only
for
underwriting
stock
and
bond
and
didn
t
charge
anything
for
advisory
work
on
merger
and
acquisition
but
for
this
particular
merger
sidney
weinberg
do
indeed
charge
a
fee
one
million
dollar
weinberg
s
million
dollar
fee
be
a
harbinger
of
the
high
merger
and
acquisition
fee
and
the
profusion
of
wall
street
initiate
merger
that
lay
ahead
but
weinberg
be
not
a
champion
of
corporate
merger
when
two
midwest
retailer
hudson
and
dayton
want
to
merge
in
goldman
sachs
work
on
the
merger
in
a
most
unusual
way
weinberg
and
partner
bob
horton
represent
hudson
while
john
whitehead
represent
dayton
at
one
point
weinberg
ask
why
do
dayton
want
to
grow
so
fast
what
good
will
that
do
them
whitehead

be
about
to

a
major
part
of

business
and
a
strategic
catapult
for

clearly
from
a
different

transition
year
the
ford

that
it

event
with

impact
on
goldman
sachs
s
competitive
position
that
be
not
acceptable
to

always
look
for

quick
to
see
how

he

to
his

weinberg

he
be
a
director
of
over
two
dozen
major

he
could

goldman

explains
john

since

most
of
the
client
he
control
the

very
definitely
the
senior
partner
and
boy

he
the
bos
i
can
hear
him
now
say
at
a
partner
meeting
i
ve
listen
and
heard
all
you
ve
say
i
ve
consider
it
very
carefully
i
will
tell
you
now
that
democracy

go
far
enough
and
then

leader
of

weinberg
have
no
interest
in
internal
operation
he
and
his
peer
be
no
more
concerned
with
organizational
management
than
the
member
of
great
social
club
be
with
housekeep
weinberg
would
advise
his
son
john
don
t
waste
your
time
on
internal
operation
of
the
organization
if
they
have
important
problem
they
ll
bring
them
to
you
as
john
recall
he
didn
t
enjoy
management
of
the
firm
he
like
investment
banking
so
he
have
other
people
manage
the
firm
one
exception
weinberg
make
be
recruiting
he
look
for
outstanding
talent
on
two
level
at
the
top
hop
to
find
a
leader
who
could
carry
on
his
own
work
of
building
up
goldman
sachs
in
investment
banking
and
certainly
not
able
to
believe
that
anyone
then
at
the
firm
could
fill
his
shoe
he
recruit
charles
saltzman
and
stanley
miller
as
potential
successor
miller
have
experience
in
wall
street
and
be
well
connect
in
new
york
city
and
with
business
leader
across
the
country
saltzman
also
well
connect
socially
have
be
a
rhodes
scholar
a
general
in
the
army
and
assistant
secretary
of
defense
under
george
marshall
however
talented
neither
man
be
ever
accepted
as
goldman
sachs
s
leader
by
the
other
partner
that
be
probably
just
as
well
since
it
left
an
opening
that
would
eventually
be
memorably
fill
by
gu
levy
who
spearhead
the
growth
of
goldman
sachs
s
trading
business
in
the
forty
fifty
and
sixty
at
the
entry
level
weinberg
take
a
special
interest
in
recruiting
mba
from
harvard
particularly
to
be
associate
in
investment
banking
that
s
how
john
whitehead
come
to
join
goldman
sachs
in
whitehead
born
in
evanston
illinois
on
april
grow
up
in
montclair
new
jersey
where
his
father
have
work
as
a
new

telephone
lineman
before
transfer
into

after
high
school
john
go
to
haverford
college
where
he
take
a
course
with
edmund
stennis
stennis
have
left
his
wealthy
culture
family
in
germany
because
of
hitler
when
he
land
in
haverford
pennsylvania
the
president
of
the
college
invite
him
to
teach
he
and
young
whitehead
developed
a
special
bond
as
whitehead
recall
stennis
certainly
open
my
eye
to
europe
and
a
wider
world
and
be
an
important
factor
in
my
confidence
that
goldman
sachs
must
expand
internationally
whitehead
work
his
way
through
haverford
serve
three
year
in

that
participate
in
the

iwo
jima
and
okinawa
and
then
earn
an
mba
with

school
the
navy
have
earlier
assign
him
to
the
business
school
as
a
wartime
instructor
so
whitehead
have
the
unique
experience
of
resign
from
the

to
become
a
student
at
the

after
graduate
in
whitehead
join
goldman
sachs
as
one
of
just
three
hundred
employee
for
what
he
expect
would
be
only
a
transitional
position
in
a
family
firm
i
thought
of
work
on
wall
street
as
a
form
of
postgraduate
training
and
as
a
way
to
get
a
broad
exposure
to
american
business
and
learn
from
see
many
company

eventually
take

whitehead
we

round

woolen
that
be
the
goldman
sachs
way
i
comply
for
most
of
that
first
year
but
when
i
start
to
roast
in
midsummer
i
thought
i
might
branch
out
sartorially
and
i
bought
myself
a
lightweight
seersucker
suit
that
i
thought
very
handsome
the
next
morning
i
felt
quite
snappy
as
i
pass
through
the
goldman
sachs
entrance
and
down
the
hall
to
the
elevator
and
step
aboard
the
car
to
ascend
to
my
swelter
squash
court
office
but
before
the
door
could
close
walter
sachs
enter
just
behind
me
the
son
of
the
cofounder
he
be
one
of
the
great
eminence
at
the
firm
short
stocky
with
a
distinguish
white
beard
he
inspire
a
certain
awe
if
not
dread
and
i
start
to
feel
miserable
as
he
survey
me
in
my
seersucker
suit
that
morning
walter
sachs
be
the
sort
of
person
that
other
people
remember
but
he
do
not
always
remember
them
although
we
d
be
introduce
a
few
time
in
the
previous
month
the
great
man
clearly
have
no
idea
who
i
be
young
man
he
address
me
anonymously
in
a
wither
tone
do
you
work
at
goldman
sachs
yes
sir
i
do
i
reply
proudly
he
scowl
and
his
visage
turn
black
in
that
case
i
would
recommend
that
you
go
home
right
now
and
change
out
of
your
pajama
despite
this
sartorial
gaffe
whitehead
make
early
progress
in
his
career
unusually
foresighted
and
more
than
willing
to
work
unrelentingly
to
achieve
his
objective
whitehead
be
soon
rise
within
the
firm
and
even
more
rapidly
in
the
esteem
of
sidney
weinberg
after
several
year
at
goldman
sachs
however
whitehead
begin
to
worry
about
his
progress
and
his
prospect
for
a
major
career
if
he
stayed
there
in
goldman
sachs
sell
only
one
underwriting
deal
in
the
entire
year
business
be
so
very
slow
that
partner
myles
cruickshank
instal
a
wastepaper
basket
in
one
corner
of
the
squash
court
so
the
young
investment
banker
could
compete
at
something
toss
coin
into
that
basket
to
keep
their
interest
up
then
thing
begin
to
improve
still
it
seem
to
whitehead
that
the
firm
be
too
dependent
on
just
one
man
a
man
clearly
at
or
past
the
peak
of
his
career
and
get
old
even
though
sidney
weinberg
may
have
be
the
best
business
getter
on
wall
street
whitehead
worried
sidney
brought
in
business
and
our
group
of
bright
young
men
handle
it
but
i
didn
t
think
that
an
investment
banking
firm
could
grow
and
succeed
with
its
source
of
revenue
so
concentrate
in
one
single
person
while
whitehead
worried
about
his
future
at
goldman
sachs
he
receive
from
time
to
time
over
the
year
offer
to
join
other
firm
early
in
j
h
whitney
co
offer
him
a
partnership
in
an
excite
new
enterprise
in
venture
capital
for
which
jock
whitney
put
up
percent
of
the
capital
and
agree
to
split
all
the
profit
fifty
fifty
with
the
staff
goldman
sachs
have
no
employee
review
process
at
that
time
so
if
you
be
young
and
hopeful
you
couldn
t
help
wonder
about
your
stand
i
d
be
at
goldman
sachs
for
eight
year
and
no
one
have
even
mention
my
be
a
partner
so
i
be
seriously
interested
in
j
h
whitney
s
approach
when
whitehead
go
to
tell
weinberg
that
much
as
he
love
work
for
him
at
goldman
sachs
he
have
receive
a
very
special
offer
to
become
a
partner
at
j
h
whitney
weinberg
reply
in
quite
absolute
term
that
this
be
not
to
be
oh
no
john
you
cannot
and
will
not
do
that
you
be
need
here
at
goldman
sachs
weinberg
promptly
reach
for
the
telephone
call
mr
whitney
and
spoke
directly
jock
your
firm
have
make
an
offer
to
john
whitehead
now
jock
we
need
john
he

important
work
for
goldman
sachs

for
me
you

not
take
him
we
need
him
here
he
s
one
of
our
best
young
men
and
valuable
to
me
i
cannot
spare
him
so
i
ask
you
now
to
withdraw
your
offer
jock
whitney
defer
to
weinberg
and
that
be
the
end
of
that
at
year
end
whitehead
make
partner
at
goldman
sachs
to
build
up
capital
in
the
firm

have
establish
a

retention
policy
that
kept

of

a
result
anyone
who
become
a
partner
in

sachs
usually
experienced
a
drop
in
spendable
income

on
his

thanks
to
the
strict

retention
policy
tenenbaum
s
spendable
income
be
just
forty
thousand

no
princely

and
a
need
to
keep
up
in
new
york
city
indeed
tenenbaum
be
borrowing
spending
money
from
his
father
so
he

his

could
get
along
tenenbaum

be
comparable
to
the

of
them
finance

tight
at

aspiration
be
high
at

where
the
key
factor
in
total
compensation
be
their
share
of

in
the

s
success
so
when

the

increasingly
important
in
the

and
do
more
for
goldman
sachs
or
i
m
not
as
good
but
we
re
not
in
one
class
we
be
not
equal
tenenbaum
have
just
put
em
up
one
on
one
with
the
man
who
have
the
power
to
determine
his
destiny
at
goldman
sachs
after
a
long
pause
during
which
neither
man
broke
eye
contact
weinberg
close
the
discussion
but
signal
recognition
of
the
central
point
you
keep
your
nose
clean
for
the
next
two
year
and
do
a
good
job
for
goldman
sachs
and
then
we
ll
see
about
that
when
weinberg
decide
in
that
a
young
investment
banker
mike
cowles
should
become
a
partner
he
call
him
when
cowles
picked
up
the
phone
weinberg
say
sidney
weinberg
but
he
pronounce
it
wine
boig
and
he
have
a
mannerism
of
raise
his
tone
on
the
last
syllable
which
make
his
self
announcement
sound
more
like
a
question
cowles
didn
t
have
any
reason
to
expect
a
call
from
sidney
weinberg
mr
weinberg
have
never
call
or
spoken
to
him
before
so
quite
understandably
he
thought
it
must
be
a
call
for
sidney
weinberg
and
hasten
to
explain
in
his
courtly
way
that
no
he
be
not
mr
weinberg
to
which
his
caller
respond
in
exasperation
i
know
you
re
not
sidney
wine
boig
and
hung
up
in
frustration
fortunately
for
cowles
weinberg
call
again
be
this
michael
cowles
yes
i
want
you
to
be
my
partner
by
this
time
cowles
think
the
whole
thing
must
be
some
sort
of
practical
joke
be
not
go
to
bite
he
have
be
with
the
firm
for
only
seven
year
and
knew
it
traditionally
take
ten
year
to
make
partner
so
it
take
more
than
a
few
minute
to
get
everything
sort
out
as
cowles
later
ruefully
observe
what
a
way
to
begin
the
most
important
phone
call
in
your
career
cowles
and
john
jamison
who
later
earn
a
big
fee
for
goldman
sachs
when
procter
gamble
acquire
clorox
be
both
weinberg
s
boy
so
when
room
be
make
in
the
partnership
for
both
of
them
gu
levy
be
able
to
get
one
of
his
boy
in
too
robert
rubin
weinberg
be
particularly
highly
regard
for
his
ability
to
get
thing
do
in
a
uniquely
quiet
but
effective
way
sometimes
conceal
aggressiveness
that
stretch
the
limit
of
hardball
an
investment
banker
who
be
there
give
this
example
after
make
a
lot
of
money
go
public
with
his
own
company
a
corporate
raider
notice
that
baldwin
united
be
sell
at
a
very
cheap
price
so
he
take
a
big
position
and
be
go
to
offer
to
buy
the
rest
of
the
stock
at
a
price
well
above
the
market
since
the
found
family
s
stock
be
held
in
a
trust
at
a
bank
the
raider
knew
the
bank
trustee
would
be
under
terrific
pressure
to
accept
such
an
offer
and
sell
the
stock
takeover
defense
be
something
goldman
sachs
specialized
in
so
the
firm
be
ask
to
help
nobody
be
sure
what
to
do
so
weinberg
be
ask
for
suggestion
at
first
he
be
not
sure
either
a
little
later
he
told
a
young
banker
to
call
a
particular
guy
a
meeting
be
arrange
at
gage

and
a

down
say

only
reason

a
brief
explanation

say
he
would
see
what
he
could
do
nobody
heard
from
him
for
a
week
then
two
week
finally
he
call
to
say

bellboy
he
s

a
week
later
the
man
in
black
call
on
the
corporate
raider
and
respectfully
say
to
him

free
country
and
so
do
i
anybody
can
buy
anything
in
this
wonderful
free
country
then
he
start
spread
the
picture
from
the
hotel
on
the
man
s
desk
and
say
you
can
buy
almost
anything
but
don
t
do
baldwin
or
these
could
show

then

and
nothing

great
willingness
to
confront

that

a
view
he
would
later
brush
aside
with
this
assertion
i
m
not
like
those
guy
some
in
wheelchair
who
fall
asleep
at

i
m
not
like
that
weinberg
continued
as
a
ford
director
until
his
death
at
seventy
seven
in

gu
levy
born
and
raise
in
new
orleans
gustave
lehmann
levy
never
lose
the
soft
louisiana
slur
in
his
speech
he
be
the
only
son
of
sigmund
levy
a
crate
manufacturer
who
die
in
when
gu
be
twelve
and
bella
lehmann

his
mother

he
spent

just
bumming
around
back
in

baruc
be

by

late
sixty

decide
they
have
to
quit
the
business
because
levy
s
unrelenting
drive
be
too
much
for
them
it
threaten
to
kill
them
both
but
in
the
meantime
levy
s
drive
and
leadership
paid
off
handsomely
by
the
late
sixty
levy
s
trading
produce
half
of
the
firm
s
profit
and
levy
who
at
his
peak
own
ten
percent
of
the

be
become
the
recognize
leader
of
goldman
sachs
levy
say
he
would
never
forget
the
day
he
first
knew
he
be
important
sidney
weinberg
have
quietly
ask
if
he
would
like
to
sit
next
to
him
at
the
partner
annual
dinner
when
it
become
time
in
for
weinberg
to
turn
over
operation
to
a
successor
levy
have
to
be
make
manage
partner
of
goldman
sachs
as
the
major
rain
maker
who
command
great
personal
loyalty
within
the
firm
he
be
the
obvious
choicei
as
the
firm
s
leader
for
a
simple
compelling
reason
he
be
already
lead
as
john
weinberg
put
it
if
gu
ask
me
to
do
anything
i
d
do
it
anytime
however
while
sidney
weinberg
accepted
the
investment
banking
business
levy
brought
in
and
respect
levy
s
profitability
and
his
internal
leadership
he
take
no
pride
in
levy
s
block
trading
business
nor
in
the
ragtag
conglomerate
company
levy
and
his
trading
prowess
attract
to
the
firm
as
investment
banking
client
levy
always
want
to
find
a
way
to
do
the
deal
which
be
a
concern
for
sidney
weinberg
who
worried
about
the
company
and
people
levy
do
business
with
conglomerate
wheeler
dealer
like
jimmy
ling
norton
simon
the
murchisons
but
that
s
where
the
business
be
to
be
do
and
levy
go
for
the
business
as
john
whitehead
observe
of
levy
he
have
only
one
central
idea
more
gu
would
take
almost
anybody
as
a
client
just
as
he
avoid
the
panel
office
on
the
seventeenth
floor
in
order
to
be
in
the
trading
room
on
the
thirteenth
floor
he
reach
for
the
doer
rather
than
for
class
while
respect
levy
s
prodigious
business
building
capability
and
extraordinary
capacity
for
work
weinberg
could
never
fully
trust
someone
with
the
instinct
of
a
trader
to
be
solely
in
command
of
the
firm
weinberg
be
hard
on
levy
and
levy
go
to
weinberg
s
son
john
to
complain
i
ve
gotta
leave
this
firm
just
before
levy
be
make
manage
partner
weinberg
anticipate
his
own
retirement
organize
a
management
committee
and
fill
it
with
partner
he
knew
be
loyal
to
him
to
control
and
restrain
levy
to
prevent
him
from
convert
goldman
sachs
from
a
banking
firm
into
a
trading
firm
as
bear
stearns
have
become
under
a
strong
trader
levy
s
close
friend
sy
lewis
as
manage
partner
levy
would
have
forty
nine
percent
of
the
vote
so
as
george
doty
explains
to
block
gu
you
d
need
one
hundred
percent
opposition
but
to
get
anything
do
gu
would
always
need
to
win
at
least
one
support
vote
during
levy
s
initial
year
as
manage
partner
weinberg
knew
that
member
of
the
management
committee
would
as
his
personal
surrogate
always
seek
his
opinion
on
key
decision
and
then
vote
as
he
told
them
to
vote
even
with
this
governor
establish
weinberg
still
have
reservation
so
he
continued
on
as
senior
partner
and
sole
decision
maker
on
partnership
percentage
levy
always
call
him
mr
weinberg
accepted
the
form
but
not
the
function
of
the
management
committee
meeting
be
held
every
week
but
they
be
kept
short
usually
only
fifteen
minute
and
there
be
minimal
discussion
no
agenda
no
minute
and
no
chair
the
group
met
in
levy
s
office
stand
and
levy
often
take
phone
call
during
meeting
to
show
how
little
importance
he
really
give
to
the
committee
as
john
weinberg
acknowledges
gu
always
resent
sidney
s
have
create
the
need
for
him
to
get
committee
approval
and
as
john
whitehead
observe
gu
be
always
afraid
he
would
fail
to
fill
sidney
weinberg
s
shoe
sidney
and
gu
be
different
in
many
many
way
recall
doty
for
example
sidney
would
listen
quite
solemnly
and
intently
to
all
you
might
want
to
say
and
then
simply
ignore
you
gu
would
not
listen
interrupt
all
the
time
and
argue
but
he
d
take
your
advice
and
information
to
heart
and
would
use
it
on
decision
that
come
to
him
levy
require
very
short
memoranda
state
the
situation
and
the
specific
recommend
action

across
the

as
gu
o
gram
they
have
to
be
so
carefully
thought
out
that
they
be
usually
only
four
or
five
line
long
otherwise
he
believe
you
weren
t
ready
to
act
extensive
examination
of
the
fact
of
the
matter
and
wide
consultation
within
the
firm

certainly
expect

have
be
do
the
complete
homework
do
not
need
to
be
parade
in
the
action

and
levy
always
come
back
within
twenty
four
hour
get
time
with
gu

hard
recall
partner
peter

he
always
read
your

he
always
get
back
to
you
in
time
levy
return
internal
phone
call
the
same
day
and
usually
the
same
hour
and
his
call
be
always
very
short
levy
routinely
cut
off
discussion
as
soon
as
he
be
ready
to
decide
a
matter
and
he
be
nothing

not
decisive
as
john
whitehead
put
it
gu
be
indefatigable
and
never

accepted
blaine

decision
not
because

agree
with

because

in

a

then
the

inside

as
well
as
with
those
outside
the

say
doty
he
d
be
very
careful
to
give
me
the
impression
that
such
and
such
have
already
be
agree
upon
by
so
and
so
and
therefore
his
hand
be
tie
so
he
and
the

would
just
have
to
live
with
it
several
time
he
really
have
me
solve
that
way
but
if
you
refuse
to
accept
it
you
d
find
out
that
amazingly
enough
he
would
still
be
able
to
renegotiate
the
supposedly
final
settlement
levy
negotiate
others
but
he
certainly
expect
no
one
to
negotiate
him
that
s
why
two
in
the
red
may
have
be
the
riskiest
outcry
in
the
history
of
goldman
sachs
a
not
particularly
competent
salesman
who
later
sue
the

the

have
the
only

even
for

you
gu
i
can
t
renege
on

however
reluctantly
levy
accepted
a
promise

a
promise
and
a
client
be
a
client
but
as
the
crowd
pour
into
madison
square
garden
that
night
the
salesman
could
be
see
wave

lucky
for

that
word
never
get
back
to
levy
levy
miss
very
little
and
be
able

take
up
his
long
yellow
pad
and
start
call
levy
be
an
extraordinarily
operational
presence
as
the
ceo
of
monsanto
recall
with
wonder
gu
would
call
in
the
morning
and
give
me
price
quote
on
various
stock
for
no
particular
reason
and
then
say
well
i

you

be
interested

up

by
the

after

over
thirty
second
and
when
return
call
come
in
levy
picked
up
his
own
phone
so
do
everyone
else
levy
want
no
secretary
in
between
customer
and
sale
trader
that
separate
customer
from
sale
trader
and
waste
valuable
time
intensity
and
speed
be
crucial
to
levy
if
he
call
me
on
a
monday
about
something
recall
doty
and
i
explain
that
it
would
take
say
three
full
week
to
get
that
thing
do
he
wouldn
t
wait
the
three
week
he
d
call
again
the
next
monday
want
to
know
if
i
d
gotten
it
do
yet

i
d
explain
again
all
the
reason
it
would
take
the
three
week
we
d
already
agree
upon
but
the
heat
be
clearly
on
and
he
just
might
needle
me
into
get
it
do
faster
and
surely
not
any
later
one
even
levy
give
a
competitor
a
ride
uptown
in
his
limo
he
have
more
than
a
page
of
foolscap
listing
one
per

the
call
he
have
receive
that
day
but

when

easy
to

or
three
block
have
be
execute
on
one
big
series

to
say
well
do
so
kay
knew
as
he
wait
on
the
line
that
there
could
only
be
one
reason
for
levy
s
call
to
chew
him
out
you
ve
miss
three
big
trade
so
far
today
don
t
you
boston

your
account
any
well
gu
love
do
business
observes
lew
eisenberg
who
head
institutional
sale
in
the
s
long
before
levy
call
him
by
his
real
name
eisenberg
be
know
as
the
kid
from
hartford
not
because
he
be
born
or
raise
there
he
be
from
chicago
but
because
that
s
where
his
initial
group
of
institutional
account
be
locate
after
a
few
year
of
cover
the
hartford
account
eisenberg
get
up
the
courage
to
propose
to
levy
that
they
make
a
joint
trip
to
hartford
to
visit
the
financial
vice
president
and
the
treasurer
of
the
traveler
insurance
company
during
the
plane
ride
to
hartford
levy
hardly
spoke
two
word
to
eisenberg
same
on
the
return
flight
nearly
a
week
later
levy
receive
a
call
from
traveler
say
the
client
felt
their
meeting
have
go
well
and
levy
could
tell
eisenberg
that
he
would
soon
be
the
sell
broker
for
the
first
block
trade
in
history
to
be
do
at
negotiate
rate
the
size
of
the
block
would
be
share
with
a
commission
of
seventy
five
thousand
dollar
unless
with
the
firm
s
usual
hustle
that
commission
could
be
double
by
find
buyer
for
that
block
and
do
a
cross
handle
both
side
of
the
transaction
generate
total
commission
of
levy
clearly
expect
the
trade
to
be
a
cross
at
once
inside
goldman
sachs
s
trading
room
levy
focus
entirely
on
do
business
he
have
tint
glass
partition
around
his
desk
which
be
in
the
center
of
the
trading
room
through
the
glass
he
could
see
all
and
hear
all
check
the
status
of
every
big
position
or
every
possible
trade
while
see
visitor
mostly
insider
and
as
many
as
ten
an
hour
and
take
and
make
call
all
the
time
often
two
or
three
call
at
the
same
time
he
have
slide
window
in
the
glass
partition
so
he
could
open
them
quickly
to
bark
instruction
as
he
frequently
do
why
do
i
do
it
it
drive
me
i
don
t
know
why
frankly
it
s
responsibility
try
to
do
the
best
you
can
it
s
not
a
question
of
get
ahead
because
i
can
t
get
ahead
much
farther
now
i
just
try
to
be
afloat
challenged
to
explain
why
he
have
a
general
reputation
for
toughness
levy
say
he
recognize
that
he
get
such
a
kick
out
of
make
a
transaction
that
i
guess
i
get
excite
and
i
say
thing
i
don
t
really
mean
then
my
conscience
get
the
best
of
me
and
i
apologize
despite
the
fact
that
that
s
the
one
thing
i
hate
to
do
levy
s
self
appraisal
be
that
he
be
too
open
and
not
tough
enough
i
think
people
at
goldman
sachs
know
that
my
door
be
always
open
i
have
certain
opinion
but
they
be
not
built
in
concrete
i
m
willing
to
listen
to
reason
gu
be
remarkable
say
john
weinberg
he
have
a
tremendous
capacity
to
do
a
huge
number
of
thing
and
do
them
all
very
well
levy
left
goldman
sachs
every
day
at
three
thirty
so
he
could
be
at
mount
sinai
to
run
the
executive
committee
from
four
to
six
and
then
would
take
a
goldman
sachs
client
to
dinner
usually
to
and
levy
be
always
networking
with
powerful
people
in
philanthropy
finance
or
politics
gu
levy
and
nelson
rockefeller
as
power
in
the
new
york
republican
party
would
go
to
a
small
room
with
nyse
floor
specialist
bunny
lasker
and
others
to
swap
story
crude
dirty
joke
political
gossip
and
personal
insight
into
powerful
people
levy
lament
i
guess
i
d
have
to
admit
that
it
s
very
hard
for
me
to
say
no
i
m
a
bad
naysayer
except
where
a
principle
be
involve
it
s
very
hard
for
me
to
turn
a
guy
down
i
wish
i
be
harder
mr
weinberg
use
to
say
that
if
i
be
a
woman
i
d
always
be
pregnant
because
i
just
can
t
say
no
levy
repeatedly
promise
one
or
another
of
his
friend
to
give
the
friend
s
son
a
job
at
goldman
sachs
usually
in
sale
and
sale
manager
ray
young
would
call
to
protest
gu
this
be
my
job
and
my
department
if
you
don
t
stop
stuff
dope
on
me
i
ll
quit
levy
affected
a
gruff
exterior
but
he
be
there
to
help
anyone
in
the
firm
who
have
a
real
crisis
on
any
serious
personal
problem
he
would
never
say
no
when
a
plane
be
hijack
in
israel
with
the
daughter
of
one
of
the
firm
s
old
messenger
aboard
levy
call
the
messenger
to
come
right
up
to
levy
s
cubicle
on
the
trading
floor
the
poor
guy
be
scar
to
death
to
go
when
he
arrive
levy
say
how
concerned
he
be
about
the
man
s
daughter
and
that
he
want
to
help
in
any
way
he
could
this
be
of
course
very
nice
to
say
but
then
levy
picked
up
the
phone
and
say
get
me
bill
rogers
when
william
rogers
be
secretary
of
state
and
in
minute
he
be
put
through
to
the
secretary
himself
levy
knew
rogers
from
his
day
as
a
new
york
lawyer
and
their
share
interest
in
republican
politics
so
he
spoke
directly
explain
his
reason
for
call
say
keep
me
post
and
hung
up
the
last
impact
levy
s
call
make
on
the
old
runner
and
others
in
the
firm
be
easy
to
imagine
levy
be
a
voracious
and
persistent
learner
always
strive
to
do
well
and
to
be
well
in
every
way
don
t
tell
me
where
we
re
good
we
can
t
do
much
about
that
tell
us
where
we
re
weak
where
we
can
improve
because
that
s
what
we
be
determine
to
do
goldman
sachs
get
well
and
well
under
his
leadership
and
levy
s
personal
stature
rise
steadily
high
as
doty
recall
with
his
amaze
memory
for
people
and
number
and
situation
he
have
a
phenomenal
list
of
people
he
could
call
and
say
i
need
you
to
help
me
and
it
won
t
hurt
you
then
he
d
explain
what
he
want
and
he
d
get
their
help
he
be
out
of
the
wild
west
as
a
young
man
a
loose
cannon
calculate
what
he
could
do
what
he
could
get
away
with
and
he
be
too
jewish
for
sidney
but
when
he
become
chairman
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
a
prominent
figure
on
the
national
scene
although
we
have
many
argument
within
the
firm
gu
become
much
more
conscious
of
the
importance
of
process
and
order
gu
be
very
proud
of
be
the
first
jew
to
be
chairman
of
the
board
of
governor
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
say
his
friend
tubby
burnham
he
consider
that
position
very
important
in
his
life
however
gu
be
really
not
a
great
chairman
because
he
couldn
t
separate
his
think
from
what
be
in
his
own
firm
s
interest
he
be
always
favor
goldman
sachs
more
important
than
his
two
year
as
chairman
of
the
big
board
levy
be
truly
the
father
of
nasdaq
s
national
market

we
ve
gotta
have
a
national
system
for
the
over
the
counter
business
and
you
ve
gotta
come
up
with
a
system
and
quickly
or
we
at
the
sec
will
have
to
impose
a
system
on

how
much
time

bermuda
gu
you
ve
gotta
chair
this
committee
and
work
out
a
solution
and
i
promise
him
he
could
have
any
people
he
want
gu
s
committee
come
up
with
the
system
where
every
otc

and
all
the
rest
have
to
show
their
bid
and
asks
through
a
central
computer
screen
and
have
to
be
good
for
one
thousand
share
on
either
side
and
that
be
the
whole
secret

toughness
particularly
in

and
have
remarkable
inner
capacity
to
rise
to
any

the
way
he

would
never
pause
or

right
away

if

he
d
sign
up
then
and
there
gu
would
work
for
any

s
how
he
get
to
know
cardinal
spellman
as
a
jew
work
for
catholic
charity
gu
levy
be
the
first
one
to
ask
how
much
publicly
at
appeal
recall
tubby
burnham
who
explain
the
way
it
happen
a
meeting
be
held
at
lehman
brother
where
the
senior
leader
of
the
jewish
community
on
wall
street
andr
meyer
joe
klingenstein
bobby
lehman
and
the
others
who
have
be
the
young
turk
back
in
the
twenty
and
thirty
put
the
challenge
on
the
table
how
could
the
young
jewish
leader
organize
their
generation
to
give
in
significant
size
we
didn
t
have
their
kind
of
money
so
gu
who
be
our
natural
leader
say
it
would
be
necessary
to
solicit
many
more
people
in
order
to
match
the
personal
give
of
the
old
wealthier
leadership
at
the
next
annual
dinner
of
the
federation
of
jewish
philanthropy
levy
take
the
microphone
and
launch
right
into
a
new
kind
of
public
solicitation
without
ever
push
or
demand
but
by
publicly
ask
in
a
nice
way
that
include
call
out
the
donor
s
name
tell
something
about
him
and
his
family
and
his
business
and
the
good
thing
he
d
be
do
at
work
and
in
philanthropy
really
the
person
s
life
history
levy
would
end
with
and
last
year
you
give
fifteen
hundred
dollar
to
the
federation
and
we
re
all
wonder
what
your
gift
will
be
this
year
and
then
in
that
moment
of
silence
the
recipient
of
levy
s
nice
word
would
say
i
ll
give
two
thousand
dollar
and
levy
would
reply
warmly
that
s
a
very
nice
gift
nice
increase
too
thank
you
very
much
levy
would
then
turn
his
charm
and
the
audience
s
attention
to
the
next
donor
of
course
he
already
knew
each
of
his
prospect
and
what
they
could
give
he
d
do
his
homework
he
knew
whom
to
ask
first
and
who
like
charles
revson
need
to
be
a
big
shot
and
get
feature
with
a
lot
of
attention
and
he
knew
exactly
when
to
call
on
each
of
them
in
that
one
even
gu
levy
raise
three
time
more
money
than
have
ever
be
raise
before
and
of
course
the
call
out
of
name
and
state
specific
amount
have
go
on
and
on
because
it
work
so
well
now
it
s
a
tradition
but
it
all
begin
with
gu
levy
gu
be
very
extroverted
gregarious
and
generous
recall
peter
sacerdote
one
year
he
give
one
million
dollar
to
the
federation
and
in
his
speech
he
say
it
be
really
not
a
big
deal
that
it
have
be
more
of
a
stretch
when
he
give
one
dollar
that
first
year
he
be
at
the
ymha
more
than
money
levy
give
his
time

levy
take
the
mike
to
say
simply
and
memorably
i
never
expect
this
i
certainly
don
t
deserve
it
and
i
ll
never
forget
it
levy
be
as
notoriously
intense
in
his
private
life
as
he
be
at
goldman
sachs
and
in
philanthropy
his
friend
burnham
recall
gu
and
i
go
all
the
way
back
to
when
he
first
get
to
new

we
talk
at
least
once
every
day
and
played

just
before

we
double
the
stake
by
the
end
of
the
ninth
hole
gu
be
down

and
finally
decides
to

the
rest
of

leadership
authority

have
to

every

just
as
a

have
to
keep
defend
his
pride
of

gu
levy
knew
and
understood
all
this
what
he
do
not
know
or
anticipate
be
that
his
great
threat
would
suddenly
bolt
out
of
the
firm

old
business
commercial
paper
where
goldman

over
the

have
make

the
lead
dealer

the
wreck
of
the

goldman

would
have
be
unable
to
expand
beyond
the
core
of
sidney
weinberg
s
corporate
client
and
even
they
would
be
at
risk
as
competitor
kept
force
the
question
without
weinberg
why
work
with
a
second
tier
firm
that
s
only
able
to
provide
one
specialized
short
term
financing
service
in
the
early
s
before
the
boom
in
corporate
bond
before
international
bond
be
anything
more
than
rare
oddity
before
the
invention
of
mortgage
back
and
asset
back
bond
such
as
gnmas
before
high

and
the
myriad
other
aspect
of

enormous

market
and
long
before
the

and
computer
model
that
tie
all
these
disparate
instrument
into
one
massive
complex
debt
capital
market
commercial
paper
be
far
more
important
than
a
current
observer
might
first
imagine
and
it
be
the
strong
basis
over
the
year
for
the
firm
s
expansion
into
money
market
instrument
and
then
on
into
bond
deal
commercial
paper
be
not
only
goldman
sachs
s
old
business
it
be
the
only
corporate
product
where
the
firm
be
the
acknowledge
market
leader
and
it
become
the
single
vital
point
of
entry
on
which
john
whitehead
be
strive
to
build
an
important
and
eventually
highly
profitable
investment
banking
business
during
the
fifty
and
sixty
use
of
commercial
paper
increase
significantly
as
interest
rate
rise
and
rise
again
issue
commercial
paper
become
increasingly
attractive
as
an
alternative
to
bank
loan
for
more
and
more
company
and
even
if
the
commercial
paper
alternative
seem
not
really
the
right
way
for
a
particular
company
to
borrow
right
now
it
be
surely
worth
consider
for
the
future
so
discuss
its
advantage
with
the
man
from
goldman
sachs
be
easy
to
justify
commercial
paper
also
make
considerable
progress
as
a
way
for
many
corporation
to
temporarily
invest
surplus
cash
interest
in
buying
commercial
paper
as
a
short
term
money
good
investment
increase
substantially
because
the
federal
reserve
s
regulation
q
limited
the
interest
rate
that
bank
could
pay
to
attract
time
deposit
commercial
paper
offer
high
rate
the
unique
sell
proposition
of
commercial
paper
unsecured
short
term
borrowing
that
be
cheaper
and
more
flexible
than
bank
loan
be
attractive
very
attractive
so
door
open
and
conversation
begin
at
more
and
more
company
without
commercial
paper
whitehead
s
ambitious
strategy
in
investment
banking
would
never
have
succeed
but
with
commercial
paper
it
be
almost
certain
to
succeed
or
so
it
seem
for
gu

him

not

this
be
a

the
first
phase
of
pollack
s
strategy
be
to
rehearse
the
extensive

so
the
juror
would
become
familiar
with
the
arcane
terminology
of

business
and
would
have
plenty

question
mr

i
take
it
from
your
direct
testimony
this
morning
that
you
admit
that
goldman
sachs
possess
nonpublic

be
this
correct

of
our
issuer
or
any
of
our
corporate
client
mr
pollack
your
honor
i
expressly
ask
that
the
witness
be
direct
to
answer
the
question
the
court
i
think
the
question
should
be
frame
with
respect
to
these
three
plaintiff
welch
food
younker
and
c
r
anthony
question
mr
levy
you
do
not
instruct
disclosure
of
this
information
to
welch
food
younker
brother
or
c
r
anthony
company
do
you
levy
i
do
not
it
be
against
our
policy
mr
pollack
i
move
that
everything
after
i
do
not
be
stricken
as
not
responsive
your
honor
the
court
yes
i
will
strike
it
question
penn
central
financial
officer
do
not
ask
you
to
withhold
this
information
from
welch
younker
and
anthony
do
they
levy
not
to
my
recollection
question
on
another
subject
mr
levy
be
it
a
fact
that
you
have
no
opinion
yourself
of
your
own
as
to
the
creditworthiness
of
penn
central
in
or
levy
well
it
be
true
i
rely
primarily
on
the
credit
judgment
of
mr
wilson
and
his
credit
man
mr
vogel
but
obviously
i
be
involve
february
th
and
th
rather
february
th
and
i
follow
the
credit
memorandum
so
i
have
some
idea
what
be
go
on
and
i
knew
a
lot
in
another
cross
examination
john
weinberg
the
partner
to
whom
the
commercial
paper
division
report
explain
that
he
get
many
page
of
green
and
blue
sheet
seldom
more
than
skim
them
and
promptly
toss
them
into
his
office
wastepaper
basket
say
in
the
straightforward
way
that
usually
establish
his
credibility
with
all
sort
of
people
but
this
time
would
backfire
with
the
jury
i
throw
them
away
i
m
a
big
wastebasket
man
pollack
would
return
to
this
phrase
it
have
a
real
impact
on
the
juror
in
his
summation
to
the
jury
pollack
begin
his
summation
by
assert
that
the
test
of
basic
honesty
be
clear
treat
your
client
as
well
as
you
treat
yourself
then
he
take
advantage
of
weinberg
s
candor
about
top
level
supervision
not
be
careful
or
close
in
supervise
and
control
the
profitable
commercial
paper
business
where
be
mr
weinberg
who
be
responsible
for
management
and
oversight
where
be
and
i
quote
the
big
wastebasket
man
then
he
summarize
the
way
the
jury
should
proceed
in
its
deliberation
the
north
star
in
this
case
be
clear
and
simple
do
goldman
sachs
know
and
not
tell
if
you
find
that
they
knew
and
you
find
they
do
not
tell
their
client
then
those
client
be
entitle
to
full
recovery
in
a
lengthy
opinion
the
court
rule
that
there
be
ample
objective
data
to
lead
a
reasonable
observer
to
conclude
that
penn
central
s
commercial
paper
be
not
prime
the
judge
brush
aside
goldman
sachs
s
argument
that
it
be
so
rat
by
dun
bradstreet
s
national
credit
office
the
private
determination
of
that
branch
of
dun
bradstreet
cannot
bind
investor
or
the
court
he
then
point
out
that
there
be
at
least
some
evidence
of
circular
reason
that
national
credit
office
have
base
its
prime
rating
on
goldman
sachs
s
continue
to
offer
the
paper
plus
goldman
sachs
s
assurance
of
penn
central
s
wealth
in
real
estate
in
late
october
the
jury
of
three
men
and
three
woman
after
the
month
long
trial
found
unanimously
that
goldman
sachs
knew
or
should
have
know
that
the
railroad
be
in
financial
difficulty
that
would
put
it
in
bankruptcy
and
order
the
firm
to
pay
back
the
three
million
dollar
the
plaintiff
have
paid
for
penn
central
commercial
paper
between
january
and
april
plus
nearly
one
million
dollar
in
interest
in
defense
of
the
firm
s
fail
trial
strategy
a
partner
contend
we
drew
an
anti
wall
street
judge
so
we
go
for
a
jury
trial
with
sullivan
cromwell
advise
that
the
firm
would
be
okay
because
commercial
paper
be
specifically
exempt
from
the
security
act
so
it
be
not
a
security
however
the
issue
be
too
complex
and
too
subtle
for
the
jury
to
parse
so
goldman
sachs
lose
in
march
goldman
sachs
settle
out
of
court
for
million
a
suit
by
getty
oil
that
have
sought
two
million
dollar
plus
five
hundred
thousand
dollar
accrue
interest
for
loss
on
penn
central
commercial
paper
purchase
five
month
before
the
bankruptcy
the
settlement
at
fifty
eight
cent
per
dollar
of
face
amount
plus
accrue
interest
more
than
double
any
previous
negotiate
settlement
in
the
penn
central
bankruptcy
be
apparently
make
because
of
the
federal
court
s
jury
award
at
percent
plus
accrue
interest
five
month
earlier
this
left
nearly
twenty
lawsuit
worth
twenty
million
dollar
still
pending
in
october
goldman
sachs
lose
another
suit
as
judge
morris
lalter
of
the
federal
district
court
in
new
york
decide
against
the

and
award
six
hundred
thousand

of

due
to
mature
june
and
one
million

from
a

the

goldman
sachs
didn
t
disclose
its
self
protective
action
to
franklin
saving
before
the
bank
bought
the
penn

and
add
that
while
such

might
have
do
great
harm
to
penn
central
goldman
sachs
have
an

either
make

abstain
from

recommend
the
security
concerned
i
understand
the
reluctance
of
goldman
sachs
possibly
to
be
the
cause
of
such
calamity
to
our
economic
structure

metzner
write
in
addition
it
have
close
business
if

personal
tie
to
the
penn
central
management
which
would
be
jeopardized
in
the
event
of
collapse
however
it
be
disclosure
of
just
such
information
to
which
the
antifraud
section
of
the
security
law
be
direct
the
judge
add
that
he
believe
this
to
be
the
perfect
example
of
an
omission
to
state
a
material
fact
necessary
to
make
the
statement
not

when

later
still

that

for

while
gu
levy
with
his
penchant
for
foist
the
son
of
his
friend
onto
sale
could
be
a
problem
for
young
nobody
else
would
dare
young
be
recognize
as
tough
and
absolutely
straight
arrow
particularly
in
the
management
committee
where
it
matter
most
no
matter
who
be
in
an
argument
everyone
in
sale
accepted
young
s
judgment
they
have
to
i
ve
heard
you
young
would
say
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
we
re
go
to
do
and
if
facial
expression
suggest
young
s
conclusion
be
not
fully
accepted
he
would
add
you
should
consider
immediate
and
total
acceptance
of
my
decision
an
absolute
condition
of
employment
period
ray
young
knew
that
in
a
service
business
the
client
always
come
first
recall
bob
menschel
s
brother
dick
also
a
partner
he
be
always
explain
to
us
that
put
the
client
first
be
always
over
the
long
term
best
for
the
firm
and
for
each
individual
ray
be
beloved
he
be
scrupulously
fair
and
non
political
within
the
equity
division
and
be
know
and
trust
to
be
a
strong
advocate
representative
for
the
division
on
the
management
committee
because
gu
and
l
jay
both
respect
ray
and
everyone
knew
it
ray
be
all
about
integrity
and
client
partner
lew
eisenberg
recall
he
come
to
my
desk
one
day
collar
a
young
sale
trainee
and
ask
be
this
kid
with
you
i
say
yes
and
ray
laid
it
on
the
line
you
have
one
hour
to
decide
whether
he
s
out
or
he
stay
and
strode
away
the
trainee
have
gotten
a
really
good
order
in
allied
chemical
and
then
be
heard
take
about
it
in
the
elevator
to
another
trainee
ray
be
very
clear
about
the
rule
and
rule
one
be
that
nobody
ever
talk
about
client
or
client
business
half
an
hour
later
after
a
very
serious
talk
with
the
trainee
i
told
ray
my
judgment
be
we
should
keep
the
kid
ray
call
us
both
down
to
his
office
and
ask
the
trainee
gruffly
what
have
you
learn
the
answer
show
he
have
gotten
the
message
to
keep
my
big
mouth
shut
sir
that
be
acceptable
to
ray
this
one
time
young
call
one
of
his
salesman
eric
dobkin
late
one
morning
be
you
go
out
to
lunch
with
a
client
no
i
m
eat
at
my
desk
come
on
up
i
m
in
town
and
that
s
how
dobkin
be
told
he
be
go
to
chicago
for
six
year
at
the
end
of
those
year
young
phone
dobkin
again
again
ask
if
he
be
free
for
lunch
but
since
i
m
in
chicago
he
can
t
mean
today
dobkin
recall
so
i

tomorrow
so
i

young
be
decisive
a
characteristic
that
salesperson
appreciate
he
built
a
strong
sale
team
partly
because
he
really
knew
the
business
and
partly
because
everyone
knew
he
believe
entirely
in
the
code
of
loyalty
up
loyalty
down
once
when

ask
for
a
chance
to
show
what
goldman

could
do
if
we
could
get
a
start
a

dreyfus

and
the
insurance
company
in

over
and
over
again
we
suggest
give
us
a
try
when
none
of
the
other
firm
can
do
your
trade
we
believe
we
can
if
you
ever
have
a
difficult
block
we
d
like
a
chance
to
show
what
we
can
do
many
many
thread
have
to
be
found
and
pull
together
to
make
the
whole
really
work
well
goldman
sachs
have
very
little
franchise
in
those
day
and
we
be
always
look
for
an
entry
point
we
put
together
a
group
of
enthusiastic
young
guy
who
like
the
security
business
enjoy
sale
and
want
to
do
a
professional
business
our
group
want
to
do
everything
differently
and
start
by
buying
out
the
old
guy
with
one
and
two
year
guarantee
of
their
past
level
of
business
then
we
turn
our
attention
to
building
a
real
business
know
we
would
have
to
do
thing
very
differently
harold
newman
a
particularly
effective
salesman
add
that
the
people
recruit
into
security
sale
as
the
department
be
know
in
the
sixty
be
a
breed
apart
from
the
conventional
stereotype
of
a
stockbroker
we
be
identify
as
people
with
standard
and
focus
who
be
creative
and
spoke
straight
a
trip
to
la
vega
in
be
the
begin
of
a
practice
that
contribute
mightily
to
goldman
sachs
s
later
success
teamwork
in
sale
for
year
a
group
of
friend
within
the
fledgling
security
sale
group
have
go
to
la
vega
twice
every
year
in
march
with
their
wife
and
on
their
own
in
october
include
in
the
group
be
young
and
two
retail
salesman
harold
newman
and
david
workman
speak
for
the
pair
newman
propose
to
young
that
they
would
be
more
productive
if
they
could
combine
their
effort
with
one
man
always
in
the
office
to
take
customer
order
while
the
other
be
always
out
prospect
for
new
business
and
then
pool
all
their
commission
as
partner
with
a
fifty
fifty
split
david
do
not
like
cold
call
but
i
didn
t
mind
it
recall
newman
but
when
i
be
out
i
need
someone
to
cover
for
me
if
one
of
my
customer
call
so
our
proposition
be
that
we
d
work
as
a
team
and
one
of
us
would
always
be
in
the
office
to
take
the
call
while
the
other
be
always
out
drum
up
new
business
richard
menschel
know
the
usual
problem
of
such
an
arrangement
be
strongly
oppose
conflict
will
abound
you
ll
never
work
it
out
the
detail
will
lead
to
argument
that
will
ruin
you
but
young
be
game
to
try
it
the
proposition
fit
well
with
gu
levy
s
dual
emphasis
on
individual
performance
and
teamwork
and
it
work
so
well
that
more
pair
of
salesman
and
then
large
and
large
group
be
soon
go
joint
before
each
salesman
have
typically
be
on
his
own
with
a
you
eat
what
you
kill
approach
to
work
and
compensation
bob
menschel
work
out
a
teamwork
motivate
system
of
compensation
for
institutional
sale
first
menschel
get
agreement
from
the
firm
that
sale
would
get
payouts
of
percent
of
gross
commission
then
the
group
agree
that
all
institutional
commission
would
be
put
into
one
pot
and
each
salesman
on
the
team
would
get
a
certain
percentage
of
the
total
for
the
year
with
annual
percentage
reset
by
menschel
recognize
that
it
would
be
difficult
to
predict
who
the
winner
would
be
for
the
come
year
menschel
reserve
a
third
of
the
total
so
he
would
have
managerial
discretion
over
a
significant
part
of
the
pool
and
could
reward
those
who
do
the
most
for
the
sale
partnership
which
grow
to
over
forty

recall
bob
menschel
we
all

their

they
couldn

the

more
challenge
or
more
educational
menschel
pretend
to
be
a
big
fund
manager
would
give
a
role
play
final
exam
the
sale
trainee
would
come
into
his
office
tell
him
what
stock
he
be
go
to
recommend
and
launch
into
a
sale
pitch
after
five
minute
when
the
salesman
might
be
just
one
third
of
his
way
through
his
presentation
menschel
might
cut
in
and
say
that
s
wonderful
really
interest
you
ve
do
a
great
job
of
research
i
m
really
interested
why
don
t
you
buy
me
ten
thousand
share
if
the
trainee
write
that
order
down
on
his
order
pad
and
return
to
give
his
presentation
no
matter
how
brilliant
and
articulate
he
would
get
a
fail
grade
why
because
he
have
already
gotten
the
order
and
be
now
by
continue
to
talk
on
after
get
the
order
run
the
risk
of
perhaps
say
something
that
might
unravel
the
buyer
s
conviction
if
that
happen
there
would
be
no
sale
the
salesman
would
have
bought
it
back
in
a
typical
role
play
session
zuckerberg
would
be
on
the

with
everyone
in
the

program
listen
in
one
night
the

have
be
kept
in
the
training
program
for
more
than
the
usual
six
month
so
he
felt
strong
pressure
to
finally
make
it
by
show
he
have
developed
the
skill
and
competence
to
pas
the
test
and
get
go
on
his
career
zuckerberg

that
the
people

sachs
dobkin
need
to
find
a
specific
lever
to
increase
the
firm
s
business
significantly
so
he
make
an
appointment
to
see
john
durham
delaware
s
top
portfolio
manager
after
the
nyse
s
close
and
ask
him
what
should
be
do
to
earn
more
business
durham
answer
tell
me
your
best
research
idea
i
ll
do
that
and
i
ll
do
even
well
reply
dobkin
after
the
close
each
day
i
ll
call
you
with
a
complete
and
unique
rundown
on
which
stock
be
be
bought
and
sell
by
the
really
smart
institutional
fund
manager
call
and
stephanie
will
put
you
through
for
the
next
ten
day
recall
dobkin
i
call
and
stephanie
put
me
through
i
give
durham
the
rundown
on
what
the
major
institution
be
do
but
there
be
no
direct
response
to
anything
i
d
be
say
so
to
move
forward
i
ask
very
respectfully
how
be
i
do
fine
so
john
what
be
you
do
click
durham
hung
up
i
be
obviously
waste
time
and
get
nowhere
recall
dobkin
i
need
a
different
approach
so
i
study
the
delaware
fund
prospectus
and
its
list
of
stockholding
and
put
myself
in
durham
s
position
try
to
guess
what
he
might
be
buying
or
sell
dobkin
calculate
that
if
he
could
give
mnuchin
a
good
indication
of
what
durham
might
be
buying
or
sell
mnuchin
would
give
him
five
thousand
or
ten
thousand
share
to
work
with
if
durham
take
the
bait
goldman
sachs
would
know
which
way
durham
be
move
so
the
firm
could
go
out
to
find
the
other
side
and
create
some
sizable
block
trading
business
i
give
mnuchin
my
best
sense
of
what
durham
be
do
bob
enjoy
play
cat
and
mouse
and
pretty
quickly
we
create
well
and
well
trading
volume
with
durham
and
the
classic
more
the
more
phenomenon
the
more
business
you
do
the
more
business
you
get
take
hold
and
our
commission
volume
really
take
off
we
do
increase
business
in
block
option
convert
and
we
be
soon
number
one
across
the
board
for
durham
and
delaware
on
another
occasion
goldman
sachs
have
position
a
two
hundred
thousand
share
block
over
eight
million
dollar
worth
of
a
midwest
utility
s
thinly
trade
stock
and
have
found
only
one
institution
that
might
be
a

of
that
much
delaware
but
delaware

they

a
risk
and
go
over
the
trader
s
head
and
speak
with
john
durham
john
we
ve
do

when

i
have
any
chit
that
i

i
need
you

come
up
an
eighth
on
this
utility
block
john
pause
okay
gu
levy
almost
smile
and
almost
say
something
in
mnuchin
and
dobkin
developed
a
new
niche
product
debt
equity
swap
and
do
a
lot
of
business
then
we
invent
installment
sale
which
become
a
very
big
business
for
the
firm
with
a
forty
nine
percent
tax
rate
on
short
term
capital
gain
when
a
takeover
involve
a
cash
tender
offer
the
installment
sale
enable
the
sell
shareholder
to
defer
the
date
on
which
the
irs
recognize
his
gain
so
he
get
a
low
tax
rate
this
arrangement
be
a
very
easy
service
to
sell
and
we
usually
knew
which
investor
to
go
after
we
go
around
to
all
the
best
law
firm
explain
exactly
how
it
work
so
they
would
bring
us
any
potential
customer
we
d
miss
we
met
many

when
former

we
instal
their

in
our
best
year
installment
sale
account
for
a
full
three
percent
of
the

s
total
earnings
and
be
a
very
good
feeder
of
extra
business
for
pc
private
client
service
be
a
broker
even
a
major

be
not
comparable
to
be
the
number
one
broker
for
a
major
institutional
account
over
and
over
again
the
typical
large
institutional

about
percent
or
percent
of
its
total

business
with
its
number
one
broker
percent
with

and

if
goldman
sachs
focus
all
its
skill
and
energy
on
be
number
one
while
other
major
competitor

third

the
firm
would
generate
a
full
percent
more
business
at
a
much
high
profit
margin
because
its
cost
be
nearly
the
same
as
the
competitor
and
in

them
as
gots

so
even
in
one
of
the
most
open
and
competitive
free
market
in
the

it
would
be
possible
to

up
a

sustainable
competitive
advantage
goldman

to
focus
on
the

the

in
the

this
be
not

at
a
major
swiss

know
this
be
an
unusual
transaction

may
i
use
a
phone
it
be
already
past
p
m
in

but
people
be
still
in
the
goldman
sachs
trading
room
attend
to
detail
of
the
day
s
trading
and
prepare
for
the
come
day
s
activity
fortunately
bob
mnuchin
be
still
there
landreth
spoke
with
mnuchin
the
appeal
be
obvious
at
a
percent
discount
goldman
sachs
could
buy
a
hundred
million
dollar
portfolio
of
diversified
blue
chip
stock
and
sell
them
as
block
at
price
sure
to
be
more
than
percent
above
the
early
morning
bid
the
firm
could
make
over
twenty
five
million
dollar
the
reward
be
clear
but
so
be
the
risk
in
a
few
day
the
shah
would
not
be
the
shah
anymore
ayatollah
khomeini
would
be
in
authority
with
ample
power
to
present
extraordinary
nonfinancial
risk
like
explosive
in
goldman
sachs
office
or
car
or
home
too
much
specific
risk
so
the
decision
become
obvious
pas
it
be
the
first
and
only
time
goldman
sachs
refuse
to
bid
on
a
record
break
trade
if
any
other
firm
take
on
the
trade
the
news
stayed
secret
during
the
late
s
and
early
s
the
equity
division
be
a
major
contributor
to
the
firm
s
profit
but
with
competition
continuously
pressure
commission
rate
down
to
low
and
low
level
and
cost
rise
and
electronic
trading
network
take
large
and
large
share
of
the
available
business
division
profitability
would
fade
away
during
the
golden
year
of
institutional
stockbrokerage
however
the
firm
have
make
the
most
of
its
opportunity

block
trading
the
risky
business
that
roar
bob
mnuchin
take
the
call
one
morning
in
january
the
most
important
call
any
block
trader
have
ever
take
a
one
billion
dollar
order
that
confirm
goldman
sachs
s
leadership
in
block
trading
the
firm
be
be
ask
to
execute
the
large
block
trading
operation
in
history
the
head
of
new
york
city
s
pension
fund
have
decide
to
convert
a
five
hundred
million
dollar
portfolio
of
common
stock
into
a
specific
portfolio
of
stock
that
would
replicate
the
stock
market
an
index
fund
this
massive
change
require
five
hundred
million
dollar
of
stock
sale
and
another
five
hundred
million
dollar
of
stock
purchase
goldman
sachs
would
have
to
bid
a
single
price
to
buy
the
whole
portfolio
and
create
the
exact
new
portfolio
the
city
s
pension
fund
manager
specify
and
to
do
so
not
as
an
agent
but
as
an
at
risk
principal
the
firm
would
commit
to
a
total
exposure
of
half
a
billion
dollar
a
principal
trade
this
big
obviously
have
to
have
the
approval
of
the
management
committee
so
mnuchin
and
his
team
go
prepared
for
a
thousand
question
they
ask
only
five
question
remembers
mnuchin
and
each
question
be
laser
like
in
its
focus
on
a
key
trading
factor
we
answer
the
five
question
and
there
be
a
moment
of
silence
and
then
everyone
agree
it
be
a
go
with
large
yellow
pad
mnuchin
and
his
team
work
the
whole
weekend
with
price
chart
recent
research
report
and
all
their
year
of
market
trading
experience
plus
all
the
bit
and
piece
of
information
they
could
pull
together
about
what
each
of
dozen
of
major
invest
institution
might
be
willing
to
buy
or
sell
then
we
have
a
plan
start
with
closing
price
on
february
goldman
sachs
guaranteed
the
pension
fund
that
the
maximum
total
cost
of
execute
trade
of
nearly
twenty
five
million
share
would
not
exceed
million
include
the
risk
of
pay
more
for
purchase
or
get
less
on
sale
than
the
closing
price
on
february
wall
street
be
a
very
small
community
say
mnuchin
normally
you
can
t
make
a
major
move
without
everyone
know
it
it
be
so
very
big
it
be
like
everyone
at
a
world
series
game
get
up
and
leave
yankee
stadium
in
the
second
inning
and
nobody
notice
anything
to
avoid
be
notice
particularly
by
competitor
firm
mnuchin
and
his
team
work
out
a
careful
strategy
as
mnuchin
recall
we
agree
we
would
be
active
every
day
no
matter
what
and
that
we
d
never
let
the
total
buying
and
total
sell
get
separate
by
more
than
million
security
be
obviously
essential
any
leak
and
the
other
broker
would
trade
ahead
of
us
so
a
code
name
be
use
operation
eagle
small
block
of
at
least
some
holding
be
sell
every
day
but
for
each
particular
stock
the
firm
be
active
one
day
and
then
quiet
for
two
or
three
day
one
block
of
share
be
sell
in
seventy
eight
separate
lot
of
one
hundred
to
thirteen
thousand
share
over
five
week
twelve
million
share
in
fifty
two
position
be
sell
and
position
purchase
in
operation
eagle
when
the
last
trade
be
finally
execute
mnuchin
picked
up
the
hotline
phone
to
announce
eagle
have
land
in
mid
march
new
york
city

that
goldman
sachs

secretly
finish

the
final
cost
to
the
new
york
city
pension
system
for

total
one
billion

be
only
million
less
than
one
third
of
percent
for
the
large
and
one
of
the
most
complicate
trade
in
history
and
an
apt
demonstration
of
goldman
sachs
s
prowess
in
block
trading
most
major
security
firm
shun

these

to

they

buying
what
smart
institutional

dangerous
the

know
something
important
why
take
a

that
the

be
set
naturally
enough
at
level
consider
appropriate
for

the

institutional

then
in

because
the

too
the

we

we

that
s
what
levy
insist
on
at
goldman
sachs
so
it
become
the
lead
institutional
stockbroker
levy
worried
that
other
firm
particularly
salomon
brother
with
its
bold
risk
take
trading
reputation
in
bond
would
muscle
in
on
his
lucrative
block
trading
business
in
stock
his
fear
be
realize
in
the
seventy
when
billy
salomon
decide
to
learn
the
equity
block
trading
business
recall
bob
menschel
he
offer
to
put
up
the
capital
to
take
on
half
of
all
our
position
we
all
knew
that
meant
solly
be
go
to
get
into
the
stock
business
with
the
same
competitive
intensity
they
be
show
in
the
bond
business
but
as
i
told
gu
he
will
do
this
with
somebody
so
why
not
with
us
for
now
so
we
be
soon
in
business
together
levy
want
all
our
share
and
he
really
saw
no
need
for
the
second
and
third
word
in
that
short
phrase
of
the
ballooning
institutional
business
so
he
take
three
bold
initiative
first
goldman
sachs
would
allow
any
institution
to
allocate
all
or
part
of
the
total
commission
on
a
trade
execute
by
goldman
sachs
as
a
give
up
paid
by
the
firm
s
check
to
another
broker
for
its
research
this
shield
institution
from
pressure
to
trade
block
through
research
broker
to
pay
for
their
research
service
or
to
compensate
retail
broker
for
sell
mutual
fund
or
to
compensate
the
brokerage
firm
for
maintain
large
bank
balance
with
them
it
also
discourage
research
firm
from
develop
block
trading
skill
and
become
direct
competitor
when
give
ups
come
along
other
firm
fought
it
recall
menschel
we
accepted
reality
say
so
be
it
and
sought
to
make
the
best
of
it
welcome
the
chance
to
do
the
trade
and
then
send
out
the
give
up
check
to
other
broker
we
be
confident
that
if
we
execute
the
trade
we
would
maximize
our
breadth
of
inquiry
the
future
trade
that
would
come
to
goldman
sachs
first
while
the
rate
at
which
brokerage
commission
be
charge
be
fix
by
the
stock
exchange
the
proportion
that
would
be
give
up
be
fully
negotiable
year
later
the
commission
themselves
would
be
make
negotiable
second
goldman
sachs
would
commit
large
amount
of
its
own
capital
to
position
block
of
stock
that
the
institution
want
to
sell
accept
the
inventory
risk
of
buying
the
unwanted
block
before
other
institutional
buyer
could
be
found
or
round
up
and
before
compete
broker
could
jump
in
and
steal
the
bacon
levy
s
team
would
work
the
phone
urgently
strive
to
find
potential
buyer
and
bring
them
to
the
point
of
decision
so
the
position
block
could
be
resold
with

s
drive
leadership
with
thirty
million
to
forty
million

of
firm

with

on
this
criterion
gu

stand
out
as
a
real
innovator
in
develop
the
business
of

his
key
lieutenant
have
that
unstoppable
drive
to
build
a

very
profitable

and
they
built
the
organization
that
would
do
it
one
part
of
that
firmwide
focus
be
the
buildup
of

but
research
be
always
a
mean
to
well

point
out
that
goldman

be
their
large

often
do
as
much
as
percent
of
their
total

but
be
not
provide
anything
like
an
equal
portion
of
the
investment
research
they
need
on
large
corporation
if
goldman
sachs
didn
t
change
and
become
far
more
helpful
in
research
on
major
company

s
large
account
bluntly
told
him
goldman

would
not
continue

nearly
so
much
of
their

business
they
would
cut
him
back
way
back
levy
knew
that
any
reduction
in
order
flow
would
harm
goldman
sachs
s
ability
to
create
the
other
side
of
block

and
to
generate
the
liquidity
to
get
out
of

any
unwind
of

more
the

of

business
would
be
costly
block
trading
be
the
real
money
spinner
at
goldman
sachs
and
because
block
trading
be
his
business
it
be
an
important
part
of
levy
s
strength
as
the
firm
s
leader
so
his
third
initiative
be
to
transform
research
as
usual
levy
get
the
message
quickly
and
be
soon
say
one
mistake
we
make
in
research
be
that
we
really
didn
t
with
the
exception
of
ibm
and
a
few
others
concentrate
on
the
big
stock
that
have
be
a
very
big
mistake
goldman
sachs
have
to
become
a
leader
in
research
on
large
corporation
now
not
because
anyone
really
want
to
but
because
gu
levy
say
they
have
to
have
research
that
really
matter
to
the
institution
would
give
goldman
sachs
the
powerful
advantage
of
time
and
access
if
the
firm
s
analyst

one
on
one
visit
to
the
analyst
and
portfolio
manager
at
all
the
major
institution
they
would
know
more
and
sooner
which
institution
be
most
likely
to
become
buyer
if
goldman
sachs
have
a
large
order
from
a
seller
or
seller
if
the
firm
have
a
big
buyer
combine
value
research
with
intensive
service
at
all
level
of
the

process
the

often
able
to
anticipate
what
the

at
these
institution
would
otherwise
find
out
about
only
several

insight
into

sell
decision
well
in
advance
of
their
actually

a
wonderful
advantage
in
get
more
and
more
of
those
big

simultaneously
levy
decide
that
goldman

be
capable
of

banker
to

particularly
the
new

the

most
of
the

thus
be
most
often
in
the

eager
to
know
what
the

key
people
at
the

be
think
and
do
and
likely
to
do
in
levy
announce
in
his
no
question
expect
way
that
from
then
on
goldman
sachs
would
concentrate
on
major
company
in
all
its
work
and
oblige
each
of
his
key

to
lead
in
make
this
new
strategic
commitment
work
in
research
trading
and
investment
banking
not
only
do
the
change
mean
deliberately
abandon
the
firm
s
traditional
focus
on
small
company
in
investment
banking
and
in
research
it
meant
commit
the
firm
to
a
business
strategy
in
which
other
large
and
more
prestigious
investment
bank
be
already
well
establish
fortunately
for
levy
and
goldman
sachs
america

a

also
be
add

the

of

goldman

be
ready
and
caught
the
wave
the

on
the
power
of

and

one

plenty
of
help
among
the
people
who
perform
strong

standouts

explains
john

gu
be
never
abusive

you
wouldn
t
work
with
gu
but
for
gu
l
jay
stayed
as
long
as
he
could
stand
work
under
gu
they
be
very
close
in
many
way
but
the
cumulative
pressure
of
the
moment
to
moment
intensity
of
work
for
gu
be
very
hard
to
sustain
indefinitely
levy
would
frequently
call
member
of
his
team
at
home
before
seven
in
the
morning
and
after
eleven
at
night
or
even
two
in
the
morning
usually
say
only
gu
be
he
there
mnuchin
be
ambitious
and
cheerfully
admits
that
partly
by
assignment
and
partly
by
initiative
i
begin
to
back
gu
up
from
the
first
mnuchin
have
hustle
recall
a
colleague
whenever
a
trader
go
to
the
bathroom
bob
be
in
his
chair
one
day
levy
be
out
of
the
office
for
a
few
hour
when
a
call
come
in
from
an
institution
that
want
to
sell
seventy
thousand
share
of
rca
a
tremendous
block
in
those
day
i
wasn
t
second
or
third
in
command
mnuchin
recall
with
a
grin
like
the
old
time
comedian
joe
e
brown
s
that
come
easily
to
him
i
be
just
there
i
call
some
account
but
i
couldn
t
get
a
firm
bid
so
i
make
a
bid
forty
nine
and
a
half
i
think
it
be
three
quarter
of
a
point
down
from
the
last
sale
then
i
call
back
the
one
institution
that
have
show
a
real
interest
and
ask
if
they
would
now
buy
at
that
price
i
held
the
phone
for
at
least
five
minute
you
don
t
know
how
long
those
five
minute
last
but
they
bought
it
when
gu
come
back
he
be
very
complimentary
and
mnuchin
be
in
while
never
close
personally
mnuchin
and
tenenbaum
have
great
professional
respect
for
each
other
tenenbaum
whose
mother
like
mnuchin
have
be
a
champion
bridge
player
observe
trading
involves
the
same
skill
the
ability
to
determine
where
all
the
card
be
sit
and
the
way
the
bidding
be
go
and
the
ability
too
to
keep
all
the
separate
situation
clear
mnuchin
himself
observes
that
a
big
factor
in
block
trading
be
memory
training
yourself
to
retain
fact
the
almost
unconscious
ability
to
have
a
mental
filing
cabinet
it
be
a
long
time
before
institution
found
it
as
natural
to
ask
for
a
block
offering
when
they
want
to
buy
stock
as
they
found
it
to
ask
for
a
bid
when
they
want
to
sell
in
the
early
day
they
tend
to
use
block
trading
only
when
they
be
sell
and
their
sell
tend
to
be
in
down
market
as
mnuchin
explains
the
entire
habit
or
process
of
active
institutional
transaction
of
their
revisit
their
portfolio
and
make
change
be
in
its
earlier
stage
so
if
you
have
for
example
a
block
of
twenty
five
thousand
share
you
want
to
sell
at
forty
nine
dollar
it
be
very
unlikely
that
you
would
find
another
institution
that
want
to
buy
that
size
block
at
that
specific
price
at
that
specific
time
the
frequency
of
find
the
other
side
of
a
trade
be
small
very
small
but
this
create
opportunity
once
block
trading
become
a
product
with
a
relatively
broad
base
as
oppose
to
an
occasional
pick
your
spot
situation
the
position
we
wound
up
hold
be
not
a
profit
center
in
themselves
but
the
volume
we
create
and
the
aggregate
commission
we
generate
minus
the
loss
on
position
for
the
most
part
become
overall
a
profitable
business
the
real
risk
in
block
trading
come
when
thing
suddenly
go
wrong
and
the
block
trader
have
bought
or
sell
a
block
and
cannot
find
the
other
side
the
hardest
aspect
of
this
business
be
the
problem
position
say
mnuchin
when
you
can
get
out
of
a
stock
that
you
re
long
at
a
small
loss
and
buy
back
a
stock
you
re
short
at
a
small
loss
that
s
an
easy
decision
it
be
painful
when
there
isn
t
an
apparent
opportunity
to
unwind
a
position
or
the
price
move
farther
and
faster
away
then
you
hesitate
then
you
pray
you
hope
that
it
will
get
well
or
you
use
the
wrong
judgment
and
believe
that
it
will
get
well
those
be
situation
when
it
be
absolutely
fantastic
to
work
with
gu
levy
mnuchin
recall
levy
s
support
during
the
hardest
single
time
i
have
before
become
a
partner
in
an
institution
want
an
offer
on
motorola
for
what
be
then
a
very
large
block
about
share
he
offer
to
provide
the
stock
at
nearly
a
point
above
the
price
of
the
last
sale
and
they
say
they
d
buy
it
well
he
say
you
never
know
which
trade
be
the
one
that
will
not
create
supply
and
demand
on
this
particular
transaction
no
supply
of
motorola
fill
in
we
be
short
all
of
it
i
handle
the
position
very
badly
and
the
stock
be
just
a
steamroller
it
wouldn
t
stop
we
do
this
transaction
at
a
price
in
the
mid
sixty
dollar
range
and
if
i
recall
properly
we
cover
the
last
share
of
the
short
at
or
it
be
a
monumental
loss
significant
seven
figure
i
wasn
t
think
about
my
partnership
prospect
i
be
worried
about
my
employment
prospect
i
have
some
genuine
concern
that
i
d
be
fire
as
a
result
of
this
motorola
deal
well
gu
be
absolutely
terrific
about
this
one
instead
of
get
fire
i
be
shortly
thereafter
make
a
partner
know
as
the
coach
for
his
hand
on
get
the
customer
on
the
phone
and
start
talk
and
stay
with
it
management
style
mnuchin
would
do
much
the
same
sort
of
thing
for
others
on
the
team
that
levy
have
do
for
him
it
may
sound
corny
he
say
but
this
business
be
really
like
a
football
team
i
m
the
play
manager
or
maybe
the
quarterback
good
quarterback
be
only
make
by
good
team
and
i
like
to
think
i
m
a
good
quarterback
and
a
good
quarterback
can
sense
when
his
linemen
be
block
hard
and
when
they
re
just
block
you
have
to
get
yourself
up
for
this
business
every
day
you
have
to
be
up
emotionally
and
keep
everybody
else
emotionally
keyed
up
all
the
time
you
ve
get
to
drive
and
motivate
people
if
you
re
placid
or
a
little
bit
tire
or
depressed
you
won
t
turn
the
routine
call
into
something
you
won
t
create
the
big
business
mnuchin
as
everyone
in
that
part
of
the
business
do
use
smoke
and
mirror
and
say
slightly
different
thing
to
different
people
but
he
could
keep
all
those
difference
clear
in
his
head
and
always
knew
exactly
what
he
d
say
to
each
account
so
he
never
get
caught
bob
rubin
once
observe
bob
have
tremendous
charisma
within
the
firm
when
every
once
in
a
while
you
d
have
a
time
when
market
would
fall
apart
on
you
bob
would
go
on
the

the
motivation
he
inspire
in
his
global

truly
electric
it
would
have
be
an
exasperate
and
frustrate
existence
if
he
hadn

love
it
so
and
i
do
love
it
avows
mnuchin
i
think
to
be
good
at
it
you
have
to
it
s
not
a
science
there
s
no
one
right
way
to
do
thing
no
contract
with
specification
every
piece
of

and
you
never

what
s
come
down
the
pike
and
aside
from
the
money
you
make
it

tremendously
exhilarate

equivalent
of

and
offering
to
buy

any

at
either
the
last

or
on
an
uptick
mnuchin
laugh
knowingly
some
of
our
bad
trade
have
result
from
pride
when
it
go
wrong
it
be
a
lonely
desperate
feel
even
though
the

be
terrific
and
supportive
there
s
a
tendency
to
be
either
very

when

it

another

will
come
and
when
i
m

i
temper
that
too
so
i
don

partner
he
be
able
to
get
weinberg
s
okay
that
a
study
of
goldman
sachs
s
new
business
activity
might
be
worth
undertaking
the
study
be
authorize
on
january
and
complete
several
month
later
but
on
the
advice
of
his
friend
john
weinberg
whitehead
cautiously
kept
in
his
desk
drawer
the
crucial
report
which
explain
the
risk
of
depend
on
one
single
person
even
one
as
remarkably
effective
as
sidney
weinberg
until
after
his
formal
admission
to
the
partnership
whitehead
say
knowingly
rock
the
boat
do
not
pay
off
with
sidney
weinberg
whitehead
s
memorandum
advocate
a
complete
change
in
the
firm
s
organizational
structure
a
change
that
would
in
time
decisively
accelerate
goldman
sachs
s
become
the
nation
s
and
then
the
world
s
preeminent
investment
bank
and
in
time
would
cause
every
major
competitor
in
the
investment
banking
industry
to
restructure
too
redefine
a
business
and
reinvent
the
firm
often
very
substantially
change
itself
and
its
way
of
do
business
be
theme
in
the
extraordinary
growth
and
expansion
of
goldman
sachs
yet
almost
always
the
firm
project
smooth
consistency
that
masked
its
unrelenting
determination
to
advance
in
competitive
position
and
increase
profit
the
most
sincere
business
compliment
be
when
competitor
change
their
strategy
and
organizational
structure
to
imitate
another
firm
s
business
strategy
and
the
structure
through
which
that
strategy
be
be
realize
the
compliment
of
replication
be
all
the
more
substantial
when
competitor
believe
the
particular
business
they
be
adjust
be
the
crucial
core
of
their
own
strategy
and
when
their
previous
organizational
structure
have
be
the
pathway
by
which
their
senior
executive
have
achieve
their
prominence
power
and
affluence
at
goldman
sachs
sidney
weinberg
have
be
succeed
greatly
within
the
old
establish
structure
in
his
irreverently
unique
way
he
have
become
a
master
of
that
traditional
structure
and
it
have
enable
him
to
become
accepted
as
an
effective
powerful
leader
so
why
would
he
be
open
to
make
any
change
let
alone
endorse
major
change
into
this
unpromising
environment
whitehead
propose
to
separate
execution
from
solicitation
and
to
have
everyone
in
investment
banking
at
goldman
sachs
work
either
on
solicit
business
and
manage
relationship
or
on
execute
specific
transaction
nobody
would
do
both
even
though
that
be
the
way
it
have
always
be
do
on
wall
street
the
idea
of
solicit
business
with
a
team
of
people
who
do
nothing
else
be
entirely
new
and
different
for
investment
banker
it
be
distasteful
to
many
include
sidney
weinberg
who
knew
how
important
he
be
and
to
many
it
seem
a
sure
waste
of
money
because
it
could
not
possibly
be
effective
who
after
all
could
compete
with
sidney
weinberg
or
with
any
of
the
other
lead
banker
at
wall
street
s
lead
firm
who
as
professional
all
take
pride
in
deliver
the
service
they
sell
and
sell
only
the
service
they
themselves
deliver
everyone
knew
that
all
investment
banking
business
have
always
be
do
at
the
high
executive
level
and
could
only
be
handle
by
skilled
and
experienced
partner
weinberg
naturally
believe
he
have
unique
skill
and
ability
to
develop
relationship
skill
and
capability
that
be
not
about
to
be
match
by
a
mere
commercial
paper
salesman
like
other
traditional
investment
banker
weinberg
believe
that
only
the
banker
who
would
actually
execute
the
transaction
could
possibly
fully
understand
what
to
promise
or
propose
and
he
saw
solicit
other
firm
client
as
unprofessional
sidney
weinberg
would
see
no
merit
in
make
any
change
he
certainly
make
no
response
to
the
copy
of
whitehead
s
memorandum
he
eventually
receive
and
weinberg
be
none
too
pleased
when
he
learn
that
copy
have
also
be
distribute
in
blue
cover
with
a
spiral
binding
to
each
of
the
firm
s
partner
however
since
whitehead
s
proposal
have
be
developed
in
response
to
weinberg
s
own
write
directive
it
be
automatically
on
the
agenda
for
the
next
partner
meeting
after
weinberg
s
dismissive
introductory
observation
that
whitehead
have
some
crazy
project
on
his
mind
whitehead
explain
his
plan
as
he
present
the
proposition
it
be
simple
point
with
deference
to
mr
weinberg
s
formidable
success
in
bring
business
to
the
firm
and
make
no
mention
of
the
obvious
risk
in
weinberg
s
clearly
get
old
whitehead
explain
that
if
ten
men
be
out
sell
and
each
of
them
could
produce
just
percent
of
what
mr
weinberg
produce
they
could
as
a
group
produce
twice
the
business
the
firm
be
then
get
through
mr
weinberg
in
suggest
the
separation
of
the
sale
and
service
function
from
the
production
function
whitehead
use
the
example
of
manufacturing
company
like
ford
the
successful
automobile
salesman
doesn
t
go
out
on
the
factory
floor
to
make
the
product
he
go
back
to
sell
more
and
serve
his
customer
because
that
s
what
he
be
best
at
while
others
do
what
they
do
best
make
car
production
and
distribution
be
quite
different
whitehead
say
building
relationship
to
bring
in
the
business
be
one
function
execute
the
specific
transaction
be
a
very
different
function
the
different
function
need
different
skill
drive
and
personality
demand
versus
supply
most
people
by
skill
interest
and
temperament
be
well
at
one
or
the
other
and
the
opportunity
for
management
be
to
match
each
person
to
the
role
where
he
have
the
best
fit
will
have
the
most
interest
and
will
do
the
best
work
for
whitehead
there
be
two
important
dimension
to
the
problem
with
wall
street
s
traditional
practice
of
just
one
investment
banker
do
it
all
for
his
client
first
sale
and
sell
be
not
demean
they
be
the
vital
strength
of
a
great
organization
and
should
be
so
recognize
it
take
time
and
thoughtful
attention
to
each
client
organization
to
become
an
expert
on
the
opportunity
and
problem
that
particular
client
must
deal
with
successfully
to
understand
how
those
problem
and
opportunity
be
change
and
might
change
as
time
pass
and
circumstance
develop
to
keep
all
the
relevant
people
at
each
client
fully
inform
about
and
confident
in
the
firm
s
special
ability
to
serve
effectively
and
to
make
them
confident
and
comfortable
that
the
firm
to
use
for
each
major
transaction
be
naturally
goldman
sachs
second
sell
should
be
separate
from
manufacturing
to
be
sure
the
best
manufacturing
skill
be
dedicate
to
make
the
best
product
produce
the
best
manufacture
product
be
key
to
deliver
the
best
service
and
there
be
just
too
many
specialized
product
in
investment
banking
for
anyone
to
be
a
true
master
of
each
and
all
of
them
weinberg
briefly
express
offhand
skepticism
in
the
meeting
and
be
clearly
not
supportive
he
rather
obviously
ignore
the
whole
idea
recall
whitehead
but
it
be
important
that
he
do
not
explicitly
reject
the
idea
either
no
formal
vote
be
take
with
no
direct
opposition
whitehead
boldly
and
quietly
decide
to
act
since
there
be
no
vote
he
explains
we
have
not
vote
no
so
i
just
go
ahead
weinberg
never
do
endorse
whitehead
s
concept
jim
gorter
who
built
the
core
of
goldman
sachs
s
national
power
in
the
midwest
and
ran
the
firm
s
important
chicago
regional
headquarters
for
many
year
explains
while
the
actual
implementation
be
somewhat
different
from
the
proposition
as
write
this
be
the
decisive
event
in
the
development
of
goldman
sachs
and
of
investment
banking
as
an
industry
of
course
acknowledges
whitehead
it
would
take
ten
year
and
several
false
start
to
get
the
proposition
all
work
out
in
operation
but
it
be
clearly
different
and
we
knew
that
goldman
sachs
have
to
be
different
to
make
a
real
change
in
our
competitive
position
in
the
business
observes
jim
weinberg
most
great
idea
develop
rather
slowly
with
a
few
lucky
break
and
then
gather
momentum
only
later
do
they
appear
to
be
the
stroke
of
genius
so
that
there
would
be
no
incremental
cost
for
the
firm
which
could
provoke
objection
whitehead
s
first
step
in
the
early
day
be
to
invite
two
commercial
paper
salesman
to
add
some
of
the
firm
s
other
product
to
what
they
be
already
offering
in
their
regular
marketing
territory
as
salesman
they
be
naturally
interested
in
this
enlarge
opportunity
say
whitehead
year
later
he
acknowledge
that
it
be
a
rather
sleazy
gambit
to
start
with
the
firm
s
commercial
paper
salesman
but
it
be
a
start
and
there
be
no
alternative
whitehead
soon
add
men
from
the
buying
department
such
as
alan
stein
in
california
and
fred
weintz
in
the
midwest
and
call
his
unit
the
new
business
department
later
rename
investment
banking
service
and
call
ibs
ibs
men
become
more
and
more
effective
in
develop
relationship
and
win
business
and
success
in
execute
transaction
deepen
their
confidence
that
the
product
professional
they
represent
be
so
intensively
specialized
and
experienced
in
their
particular
product
that
they
must
be
among
the
best
in
the
entire
industry
the
central
question
become
where
should
the
firm
s
relationship
manager
concentrate
so
they
could
be
most
productive
as
we
look
at
the
overall
market
the
hundred
large
corporation
be
all
pretty
much
lock
up
by
the
lead
wall
street
firm
say
whitehead
most
have
just
one
major
investment
banker
and
often
a
partner
of
that
firm
be
already
sit
on
their
board
of
director
determine
to
protect
his
firm
s
relationship
and
keep
all
the
available
business
so
there
wasn
t
much
chance
in
those
early
day
to
get
them
to
change
to
goldman
sachs
but
there
be
many
many
other
corporation
so
we
focus
on
them
into
the
mid
s
goldman
sachs
concentrate
on
small
and
midsize
corporation
the
so
call
fortune
second
and
many
even
small
company
whitehead
s
group
initially
work
with
a
list
of
five
hundred
company
this
list
be
soon
expand
to
one
thousand
and
then
to
two
thousand
as
more
people
be
add
to
ibs
the
list
each
cover
be
cut
from
two
hundred
down
to
one
hundred
company
so
more
and
more
company
be
cover
more
and
more
intensively
by
every
one
of
the
four
thousand
u
s
corporation
earn
one
million
dollar
or
more
have
an
investment
banker
at
goldman
sachs
responsible
for
try
to
do
business
with
it
in
the
five
year
between
and
the
firm
add
five
hundred
new
client
literally
double
its
clientele
within
a
generation
every
major
firm
on
wall
street
be
oblige
by
competitive
reality
to
adopt
whitehead
s
organizational
concept
have
gotten
their
sell
experience
in
the
commercial
paper
business
the
commercial
paper
salesman
knew
the
discipline
of
patience
persistence
and
procedure
they
have
to
build
comprehensive
credit
file
on
prospective
issuer
long
before
they
do
any
business
so
the
firm
could
respond
swiftly
if
and
when
a
company
might
call
to
say
it
have
decide
to
issue
commercial
paper
as
fred
weintz
recall
those
early
day
an
ibs
man
would
write
a
report
to
the
buying
committee
explain
the
company
and
what
it
want
to
do
with
the
capital
then
there
would
be
extensive
check
with
competitor
supplier
and
customer
to
find
out
what
the
company
and
its
management
be
really
like
i
be
always
make
new
call
but
we
want
to
develop
relationship
and
would
try
like
hell
to
do
a
good
job
for
each
client
we
knew
that
if
we
do
our
work
really
well
for
each
client
more
business
would
follow
and
we
d
get
recommend
to
others
our
competition
for
underwriting
consist
of
blyth
merrill
lynch
first
boston
and
mcdonald
but
whitehead
wasn
t
look
for
mandate
to
sell
just
commercial
paper
i
be
always
look
for
some
other
thing
we
could
sell
so
i
might
see
a
possibility
at
one
of
the
company
for
say
a
debt
private
placement
and
say
ted
why
don
t
we
also
sell
these
folk
a
private
placement
and
ted
would
try
it
out
on
his
next
visit
and
write
it
up
in
his
call
report
and
then
i
d
say
to
bob
and
others
do
you
notice
that
ted
s
already
talk
to
company
x
about
a
private
placement
look
like
a
good
idea
and
pretty
soon
bob
would
report
on
his
call
report
that
he
be
recommend
a
private
placement
to
company

this

go
to
all
the

the
triumph
for

that
goldman

have
persuade

not

whitehead
be
optimistic
and
determine
as
he
recall
those
year
pretty
soon
we
d
get
another
mandate
and
do
another
transaction
and
would
celebrate
that
fine
achievement
rather
widely
and
visibly
we
kept
do
this
until
the
whole
team
be
engage

first
to

later

eventually
to

into
an

that

a
grow

and

no
other

could
match
it
even
competitor
call
it
the
machine
whitehead
recall
with
a
smile
how
the
business
be
built
we
would
of
course
defend
and
protect
our
own
client
take
full
advantage
of
our
be
their
traditional
investment
bank
and
say
to
a
ceo
who
have
just
come
into
office
at
a
firm
client
oh
sir
you
wouldn
t
even
think
of
change
your
company
s
long
establish
investment
banking
relationship
because
this
be
something
that
have
go
on
for
generation
before
you
come
on
the
scene
you
ll
be
ceo
for
only
a
few
year
but
the
relationship
between
goldman
sachs
and
this
company
will
certainly
continue
on
forever
but
then
with
other
firm
client
of
course
we
talk
a
very
different
line
say
who
do
morgan
stanley
think
they
be
to
claim
that
they
own
you
you
be
an
independent
company
you
have
every
right
to
pick
your
own
investment
banker
base
on
whoever
you
think
be
the
very
ablest
and
not
be
bound
by
past
history
whitehead
s
first
task
be
to
build
ibs
into
an
organization
that
could
successfully
initiate
develop
and
build
business
relationship
with
many
many
corporation
the
second
and
simultaneous
task
be
to
elevate
the
stature
of
ibs
within
the
firm
to
equal
the
traditionally
dominant
buying
department
where
skeptic
and
resister
be
numerous
this
equality
in
stature
would
depend
on
the
ability
to
recruit
and
keep
exceptionally
talented
and
ambitious
professional
work
in
ibs
for
their
full
career
for
several
year
whitehead
lead
the
recruiting
each
year
at
harvard
business
school
he
be
also
always
look
for
unusually
capable
commercial
banker
who
might
transfer
for
more
opportunity
and
he
recruit
people
from
other
firm
concentrate
on
ambitious
young
people
who
have
good
training
and
experience
but
might
feel
stymie
in
their
career
whitehead
would
offer
them
the
opportunity
to
have
their
own
account
and
a
promotion
to
vice
president
fred
weintz
recall
how
thing
be
not
long
after
john
whitehead
put
forward
his
plan
to
establish
a
new
business
department
jim
weinberg
persuade
me
to
apply
for
a
transfer
from
commercial
paper
sale
commercial
paper
be
not
very
profitable
but
it
be
a
good
way
to
get
start
with
a
company
while
look
for
a
chance
to
do
a
future
public
offering
if
the
company
earn
at
least
one
million
dollar
and
obviously
it
have
to
be
a
quality
company
to
pas
with
sidney
weinberg
the
firm
be
also
try
to
recruit
commercial
banker
on
the
theory
they
knew
how
to
call
on
company
for
financial
business
and
be
offering
them
twelve
thousand
dollar
a
year
but
when
i
be
take
on
as
an
internal
transfer
it
be
for
only
because
the
firm
s
cost
control
be
so
very
strict
follow
the
pattern
use
for
commercial
paper
sale
we
be
organize
by
geographic
area
with
five

one
in

for
any

in
the

that

mr
weinberg
s
we
be
always
strive
to
rationalize
our
business
and
the
operation
of
the
new
business
department
we
knew
we
be
nowhere
in
oil
and
morgan
stanley
and
first
boston
have

goldman
sachs

a
few
in

but
most
of
our
client
be
spread
across
the
next
thousand
we
have
group
meeting
all
the
time
try
to
figure
out
way
to
improve
our
business
whitehead
recall
since
there
be
hardly
ever
any
change
in
investment
banking
relationship
in
those
early
day
our
task
of
break
in
be
daunt
we
would
evaluate
our
performance
by
how
many
new
client
we
add
in
a
year
versus
how
many
we
lose
after
a
long
year

work
we
might
be
up
three
or
up
six
or
something
like
that
it
didn
t
seem
to

take
the
credit
for

and
the
overhead
go
up
and
small
gain
be
celebrate
as
great
achievement
but
the
flow
of
business
do
not
really
increase
the
idea
that
commercial
paper
profit
would
finance
the
expand
new
business
organization
look
to
some
like
wishful
think
as
george
doty
observe
goldman
sachs
s
new
business
development
organization
be
by
no
mean
an
overnight
success
for
several
year
it
be
a
money
loser
that
s
one
of
the
main
reason
other
firm
do
not
duplicate
it
who
want
to
duplicate
an
experiment
that
be
a
radical
departure
from
the
try
and
proven
and
doesn
t
seem
to
be
work
all
that
well
it
would
take
ten
year
and
several
false
start
before
whitehead
s
innovation
work
out
sidney

never

it
or

and
be

in

until
the
day
he
die

give
more
and
more
of
his

in

the

deeply
engage

have
corner
whitehead
in
the
hallway
to
bemoan
the
dreadful
news
that
with
all
its
hire
of
people
the
firm
be
now
saddle
with
a
huge
annual
overhead
of
twelve
million
dollar
levy
worried
aloud
we
ll
have
to
take
in
a
million
dollar
every
month
just
to
break
even
whitehead
offer
reassurance
that
with
some
planning
this
apparently
awesome
cost
burden
could
actually
be
cover
by
normal
and
expect
operation
for
starter
whitehead
say
he
would
estimate
that
the
investment
banking
part
of
the
firm
would
do
at
least
one
private
placement
a
month
and
take
a
pad
of
paper
write
down
x
to
record
the
fee
that
might
be
expect
from
this
line
of
business
which
at
the
time
be
a
major
product
line
for
the
firm
then
he
add
a
line
for
commercial
paper
and
then
another
line
for
a
third
service
and
so
on
until
he
have
accumulate
six
million
dollar
in
expect
revenue
all
from
investment
banking
then
he
ask
levy
who
ran
both
arbitrage
and
stockbrokerage
and
what
would
you
guess
you
can
expect
to
do
respond
to
an
implicit
competitive
challenge
and
quickly
catch
onto
the
play
of
the
game
levy
venture
an
estimate
of
the
commission
to
be
generate
by
each
of
his
twenty
five
large
stockbrokerage
client
and
then
those
likely
to
come
from
the
next
fifty
and
then
add
something
for
arbitrage
as
each
new
item
be
put
forward
whitehead
write
it
on
his
pad
then
note
that
the
total
come
to
more
than
the
previously
daunt
twelve
million
dollar
whitehead
have
a
rough
business
forecast
for
the
come
year
and
write
across
the

budget
with
this
simple
start
the
discipline

on
its
way

twenty

six

the

begin
to

with

of

the

of

that

specialization
by

in
addition
to

begin
institutionally
in
the
early
s
with

dick
fay
focus
on
finance
company
then
burt
sorenson
also
a
partner
start
to
focus
on
utility
when
barrie
wigmore
a
canadian
join
the
firm
in
whitehead
s
strategic
objective
be
to
accelerate
the
pace
at
goldman
sachs
by
recruiting
people
like
wigmore
who
want
to
achieve
something
special
in
their
career
be
more
than
willing
to
work
long
hour
and
weekend
to
make
it
happen
and
saw
change
as
excite
and
fun
k
the
original
plan
be
to
pair
wigmore
with
charlie
saltzman
a
retire
general
who
have
serve
at
a
senior
level
in
the
state
department
before
he
be
hire
into
the
firm
by
sidney
weinberg
already
in
his
sixty
saltzman
be
near
retirement
so
wigmore
be
in
line
to
take
over
coverage
of
his
company
in
a
year
or
two
but
before
that
change
ever
take
place
whitehead
decide
it
would
be
well
to
put
wigmore
in
charge
of
try
to
develop
business
for
goldman
sachs
in
the
huge
public
utility
business
corporate
bond
issuance
be
dominate
by
public
utility
but
goldman
sachs
have
no
fix
income
research
and
no
strength
in
bond
sale
moreover
most
utility
issue
be
competitively
bid
goldman
sachs
historically
have
little
interest
in
that
low
margin
business
but
whitehead
still
saw
possibility
to
whitehead
utility
represent
a
major
opportunity
not
because
they
do
over
half
of
the
total
public
security
offering
by
corporation
not
because
they
be
sure
to
continue
to
be
major
user
of
wall
street
underwritings
in
good
economy
and
bad
not
because
there
be
so
many
of
them
not
because
they
be
locate
all
over
the
country
and
not
because
utility
be
important
to
such
prestigious
investment
banking
firm
as
morgan
stanley
first
boston
merrill
lynch
white
weld
and
salomon
brother
in
whitehead
s
view
utility
represent
a
major
opportunity
because
goldman
sachs
have
almost
no
business
with
utility
so
the
opportunity
be
unlimited
whitehead
explain
the
opportunity
wigmore
could
develop
his
own
strategy
wasn
t
expect
to
spend
time
protect
exist
business
with
old
client
and
could
go
anywhere
and
do
anything
the
one

that
the

do
any
business
with
in

he
automatically

in
the

and
soon
establish
a
reputation
with

as
an

at

in

a

this
give

first
we

then
we
take

we
go

told
us
they
still
have
eighty

so
we
take

this

establish

as
goldman

begin

and
no

the

recall

so
they
begin
give

it

the

it

in

dundee
and

have
be
especially
regular
customer
for

underwritings
so
they
have
gotten
to
know
the

and
the

knew
them
more
important
goldman
sachs
have
be

as
wigmore
say
we

the
utility
group
have
a
parallel
success
with
the

because
the
firm
still
have
a
weak
hand
with
electric
utility
wigmore
concentrate
at
first
on
the

industry
which
have
a
more
industrial
mind
set
that
suit
goldman
sachs

traditional
skill
fortunately
white
weld
one
of
the
traditional
pipeline
investment

be
in
decline
at
the
time
and

be
slow
to
specialize
in

business
in
new
issue
by
pipeline
company
the
firm
go
from
zero
to
rank
number
one
but
at
first
say
wigmore
we
start
as
always
beating
our
head
against
the
wall
with
the
intensity
of
our
call
and
call
fortunately
the
pipeline
company
saw
themselves
as
industrials
not
utility
so
they
like
that
goldman
sachs
be
an
industrial
underwriter
as
pipeline
company
try
to
diversify

the
opportunity
to
apply
the
firm
s
merger

skill
in
the

industry
then
in
the
mid
s
when
unfriendly
tender
offer
become
popular
wigmore
have
a
revelation
the
pipeline
be
sit
duck
target
for
hostile
takeover
the
number
be
star
me
and
anyone
else
who
would
look
right
in
the
face
so
he
make
the
round
of
the
pipeline
company
to
warn
them
you
ll
get
raid
or
lboed
this
warn
be
more
correct
and
timely
than
even
he
realize
when
city
service
be
force
to
sell
off
its
gas
pipeline
in
it
attract
an
astonish
twenty
different
bidder
it
be
so
obvious
what
that
meant
the
whole
pipeline
industry
be
now
in
play
all
i
could

in

the

group
broke
the

because
by
intense

it
make
more

and
potentially
a
real
benefit
the
company
agree
if
the
other
firm
would
go
along
whitehead
than
call
the
banker
at
the
competitor
firm
we
ve
be
banker
for
a
very
long
time
for
this
company
and
it
would
be
awkward
for
us
to
have
your
firm
act
as
the
sole
senior
manager
on
a
public
offering
by
the
company
i
ve
spoken
with
my
friend
at
the
company
and
while
they
like
your
initiative
on
this
particular
financing
they
would
have
no
trouble
at
all
with
our
jointly
manage
this
offering
of
course
as
we
both
know
there
be
always
many
many
way
for
friendly
firm
in
wall
street
to
help
one
another
as
the
year
go
by
and
candidly
it
would
mean
a
lot
to
us
at
goldman
sachs
if
you
could
see
the
merit
in
not
exclude
us
since
we
be
their
traditional
investment
banker
whitehead
go
on
a
bit
more
but
the
other
banker
have
already
gotten
the
message
and
knew
he
would
be
wise
to
accept
reality
and
to
do
so
promptly
john
why
don
t
we
agree
right
here
and
now
to
comanage
at
the
company
s
headquarters
whitehead
and
the
competitor
banker
met
with
the
cfo
to
determine
the
term
of
the
transaction
graciously
whitehead
apparently
recognize
the
competitor
s
have
initiate
the
transaction
say
why
don
t
you
begin
with
your
thought
on
pricing
the
bait
be
out
and
the
other
banker
go
for
it
we
think
the
interest
rate
we
can
go
to
market
with
be
fifteen
and
a
half
percent
and
that
at
this
rate
we
can
raise
twenty
million
dollar
why
not
develop
how
you
arrive
at
your
pricing
conclusion
prompt
whitehead
so
the
other
banker
explain
his
reason
make
it
clear
that
in
his
firm
s
carefully
consider
opinion
this
be
the
very
best
possible
price
and
maybe
even
a
bit
of
a
stretch
this
lock
him
into
his
position
and
make
it
easy
for
whitehead
to
go
right
around
him
at
goldman
sachs
we
look
at
this
issue
and
the
market
somewhat
differently
if
that
s
the
best
our
fine
competitor
can
do
then
i
m
pleased
to
say
that
we
at
goldman
sachs
be
prepared
to
offer
a
full
twenty
five
basis
point
low
cost
to
our
good
client
two
week
later
goldman
sachs
be
sole
manager
of
the
offering
when
they
saw
each
other
again
a
year
later
the
competitor
say
john
you
taught
me
a
lesson
a
very
expensive
lesson
whitehead
reply
maybe
it
seem
expensive
to
you
in
the
short
run
but
in
the
long
run
you
ll
never
leave
yourself
so
open
to
a
competitor
you
re
young
over
the
year
ahead
i
m
sure
you
ll
profit
from
the
experience
shortly
thereafter
whitehead
invite
the
banker
to
luncheon
in
one
of
the
firm
s
private
din
room
this
time
his
interest
be
more
personal
whitehead
want
to
know
if
he
might
be
interested
in
join
goldman
sachs
this
inquiry
be
not
unusual
over
the
year
whitehead
developed
the
practice
and
strongly
encourage
all
others
in
ibs
to
join
him
of
recruiting
the
best
people
at
competitor
this
concept
soon
become
codify
it
be
almost
okay
to
lose
an
important
transaction
if
you
recruit
to
ibs
the
competitor
who
won
whitehead
recognize
early
on
that
divide
the
spoil
or
allocate
credit
for
transaction
among
goldman
sachs
people
could
easily
become
divisive
after
all
how
and
why
would
relationship
specialist
fully
appreciate
all
the
contribution
that
have
be
make
by
transaction
expert
and
how
and
why
would
transaction
expert
fully
appreciate
all
the
important
contribution
make
by
the
relationship
specialist
to
the
firm
s
overall
success
so
whitehead
instal
a
win
win
approach
to
compensation
that
would
help
avoid
confrontation
and
help
build
strong
teamwork
and
encourage
everyone
to
concentrate
on
make
the
phalanx
system
work
percent
credit
for
each
transaction
would
go
to
both
side
if
a
client
assign
to
murphy
do
a
transaction
with
the
firm
murphy
get
full
credit
whether
murphy
actually
do
anything
or
not
so
there
be
zero
reason
to
try
go
around
murphy
or
to
ask
potentially
ugly
question
about
whether
murphy
be
percent
responsible
or
only
percent
or
merely
percent
responsible
for
the
complete
transaction
delineation
perfection
that
could
easily
hurt
feeling
and
distract
people
from
focus
percent
on
work
for
the
client
after
each
transaction
an
internal
memorandum
would
detail
the
specific
contribution
of
each
banker
so
all
get
recognition
for
what
they
have
do
and
all
saw
the
importance
to
the
firm
s
success
of
all
the
other
contribution
clearly
emphasize
the
importance
of
the
firm
s
commitment
to
teamwork
as
whitehead
explains
talented
people
want
recognition
and
respect
for
their
skill
and
their
achievement
even
more
than
they
want
money
they
need
and
appreciate
acceptance
and
respect
when
approach
the
annual
compensation
review
period
whitehead
would
send
a
memo
to
all
member
of
ibs
ask
for
input
so
we
ll
be
sure
to
know
all
you
ve
do
this
year
each
person
would
write
up
his
own
report
card
which
whitehead
and
others
would
carefully
study
while
other
firm
concentrate
on
production
the
volume
and
profitability
of
transaction
whitehead
establish
at
goldman
sachs
that
half
of
a
banker
s
bonus
depend
upon
evaluation
from
others
of
how
helpful
he
be
to
them
a
compensation
process
that
strongly
encourage
everyone
to
focus
on
make
the
firm
s
phalanx
system
work
well
these
evaluation
be
write
and
collect
into
what
become
know
ironically
as
the
slam
book
to
encourage
reach
out
across

line
compensation
for
teamwork
across

boundary
be

and
reward
so
be
individual
achievement
of
course
we
all
care
greatly
about
real
teamwork
whitehead
would
say
so
we
re
very
glad
you
give
a
lot
of
credit
to
so
many
other
people
we
just
want
to
be
sure
you
know
how
very
much
we
really
appreciate
all
the
good
work
we
know
you
have
do
if
there
be
a
fault
in
gu
levy
s
management
style
it
be
that
he
be
not
a
very
good
delegator
say
whitehead
gu
be
not
a

he
be
a
day

operator
to
gu
short
range
be
what
s
happen
this
morning
and
long
range
be
what
s
go
to
happen
this
afternoon
he
felt
that
wall
street
be
a
constantly
change
field
in
which
it
be
hard
to
plan
maybe
almost
impossible
to
plan
you
just
sort
of
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
when
they
appear
it
be
a
trader
s
instinct
that
create
his
success
and
so
others
of
us
rather
than
gu
be
the
one
who
thought
in

of
look
ahead

what

we

he

quite
unconcerned
about

he
never
fraternize
with

within
the

respect

not

behind
his

the

played
a
key
role
in
the
early
year
of
building
goldman
sachs
s
international
business
they
ll
accept
private
criticism
but
never
public
ridicule
john
could
twit
banker
in
public
and
they
didn
t
like
it
one
little
bit
they
resent
it
whitehead
not
only
design
and
staffed
his
productive
organization
he
make
it
work
say
to
one
banker
after
another
you
can
do
it
and
always
clearly
imply
and
if
i
hold
you
to
it
you
will
do
it
john
be
almost
regal
in
the
way
he
act
say
smith
i
never
met
anyone
else
like
that
in
my
life
it
s
really
quite
amaze
he
tell
you
exactly
what
he
want
you
to
do
give
you
the
clear
understand
you
have
no
alternative
and
must
do
it
then
proceeds
to
encourage
you
to
believe
you
might
very
well
be
able
to
do
it
and
then
continue
on
to
give
you
the
feel
you
might
even
enjoy
do
it
particularly
if
you
commit
your
every
effort
to
be
sure
you
ll
succeed
we
have
no
big
and
bad
idea
explains
whitehead
with
evident
satisfaction
as
he
reflect
on
the
firm
s
development
we
knew
it
would
take
a
generation
to
complete
the
change
of
our
position
in
the
marketplace
do
thousand
of
little
thing
day
after
day
inch
along
as
consistently
as
you
can
in
the
right
direction
as
best
you
can
tell
be
management
and
motivate
or
inspire
everyone
to
work
together
for
long
term
purpose
be
leadership
whitehead
didn
t
waste
any
energy
gain
force
and
effect
through
the
no
wave
consistency
of
his
commitment
to
a
few
long
range
objective
and
his
steady
rational
approach
the
firm
s
development
be
not
organize
around
grand
strategy
but
grow
out
of
a
continuously
aggressive
drive
to
move
ahead
as
we
make
change
almost
continuously
we
have
many
many
failure
concedes
whitehead
but
they
be
almost
always
little
failure
that
could
be
stop
without
harm
to
the
firm
we
never
felt
the
way
to
go
forward
be
with
a
handful
of
superstar
or
some
big
acquisition
if
goldman
sachs
want
to
get
into
a
business
it
prefer
to
give
the
challenge
to
some
of
its
own
most
promising
young
people
when
as
we
rarely
do
we
decide
to
go
outside
the
firm
for
talent
we
avoid
hire
whole
group
or
team
instead
we
would
identify
the
very
best
people
get
to
know
them
well
and
bring
them
over
individually
these
new
individual
would
learn
the
goldman
sachs
culture
and
either
blend
into
the
firm
or
they
would
not
make
it
at
goldman
sachs
we
always
try
to
be
creative
with
the
new
technique
and
new
financial
product
but
i
never
thought
we
have
to
be
first
with
everything
i
be
perfectly
happy
to
have
another
firm
be
first
with
a
new
idea
because
i
be
confident
that
with
our
superior
marketing
organization
we
would
improve
the
product
and
then
achieve
dominance
through
distribution
while
those
other
firm
put
their
reputation
at
risk
if
it
didn
t
work

right
now
as
he

well

governor
nelson
aldrich
rockefeller
his
repeat
theme
in
his
eulogy
for
gu

caught
the
sense
of
the
congregation
oh
what
a
man
he
be
l
gu
be
always
gruff
and
always
very
fair
recall
a
former
partner
he
could
put
the
fear
of
god
into
you
if
you
miss
a
trade
but
you
knew
he
want
you
to
do
well
and
you
knew
if
you
ever
need
him
that
he
d
be
there
for
you
one
friday
after
thanksgiving
i
take
my
young
son
in
to
see
the
firm
and
show
him
around
i
call
inez
to
see
if
it
would
be
okay
to
go
down
to
the
trading
floor
and
she
call
back
to
say
it
d
be
okay
at
lunchtime
while
we
be
there
i
notice
gu
s
cubicle
be
empty
so
we
go
over
just
then
gu
come
along
and
naturally
want
to
know
what
be
go
on
so
i
introduce
my
son
gu
shook
his
hand
and
we
left
back
home
my
son
drew
a
picture
of
a
stick
figure
with
a
big
cigar
and
write
big
gu
levey
under
it
a
few
day
later
i
ask
inez
what
she
thought
of
my
give
it
to
gu
and
she
thought
it
be
a
great
idea
year
later
after
gu
die
she
be
cleaning
out
his
desk
and
there
it
be
he
d
save
it
all
those
year
after
he
and
john
weinberg
jointly
succeed
levy
as
head
of
the
firm
whitehead
s
effectiveness
on
high
level
strategy
and
policy
be
match
by
a
focus
on
client
operation
john
be
consistently
very
clear
mind
and
insightful
say
partner
jun
makihara
when
we
brought
tgif
a
fast
grow
restaurant
chain
to
the
executive
committee
and
present
all
the
great
number
for
this
fast
grower
john
say
i
ve
never
be
in
one
of
these
restaurant
but
this
be
clearly
a
fad
it
can
go
as
fast
as
it
have
come
we
need
to
watch
closely
and
report
to
this
committee
same
store
sale
every
month
he
be
certainly
focus
on
the
right
thing
within
month
problem
be
start
to
show
but
they
be
only
visible
on
the
one
measure
john
have
make
us
focus
in
on
you
learn
a
lot
when
people
like
john
whitehead
be
review
your
work
look
ahead
whitehead
have
no
great
plan
to
change
just
to
improve
we
will
continue
to
expand
internationally
however
we
must
be
careful
not
to
let
the
firm
grow
too
big
and
lose
the
intimacy
that
we
and
our
people
treasure
later
others
would
argue
that
whitehead
s
deliberate
careful
approach
be
not
as
aggressive
as
the
firm
should
have
be
partly
because
the
increasingly
competitive
market
be
change
and
partly
because
goldman
sachs
have
be
change
by
whitehead
and
weinberg
so
it
could
be
more
aggressive
and
more
innovative
john
whitehead
believe
in
the
ibm
approach
say
steve
friedman
develop
superior
strong
relationship
with
the
maximum
number
of
client
and
be
conservative
with
new
product
and
service
introduction
because
they
don
t
all
work
and
you
don
t
want
to
harm
those
relationship
that
take
year
to
develop
and
that
you
ll
want
to
come
back
to
again
and
again
this
lead
to
cautious
incrementalism
on
the
product
side
and
no
big
breakthrough
innovation
because
if
you
re
not
look
hard
for
innovation
you
certainly
won
t
find
them
and
the
general
feel
be
don
t
innovate
it
s
not
want
and
in
fact
be
clearly
unwanted
so
innovator
be
take
career
risk
and
risk
be
the
major
no

sunday
afternoon
in

he

whitehead
i
try
to
be
direct
even
pithy
and
try
very
hard
to
avoid
anything
that
might
read
like
motherhood
contemplate
the
growth
of
goldman
sachs
he
have
realize
with
concern
several
week
before

even
with

through
the

uneasy
with
the

large
and
more
diverse
and
add
so
many
new
people
the
traditional
but
inherently
slow
one
on
one
apprentice
approach
of
passing
along
the
core
value
of
goldman
sachs
would
surely
be
overwhelmed
by
the
number
of
new
people
without
appropriate
action
the
core
value
could
not
be
successfully
pass
on
to
the
increasingly
large

diverse

the

unique
culture

whitehead
believe
be
crucial
to
its
growth

success
would
be
put
at
risk
by
the

s
own
success
and
growth
whitehead
kept
come
back
to
a
gnawing
question
how
could
we
get
the
message
to
all
those
individual
who
be
new
to
goldman
sachs
in
such
a
way
that
they
would
understand
our
core
value
come
to
believe
in
them
and
make
the
firm
s
value
their
value
in
everything
they
do
every
day
whitehead
collect
what
he
thought
be
the
exist
but
unwritten
principle
of
goldman
sachs
thought
about
them
for
week
and
then
spent
that
sunday
afternoon
write
them
out
longhand
the
list
begin
with
ten
major
statement
but
whitehead
soon
heard
from
george
doty
a
devout
catholic
that
that
seem
sacrilegious
a
list
of
ten
principle
be
too
close
to
the
ten
commandment
so
the
list
be
expand
with
a
few
change
by
other
partner
our
business
principle
be
set
in
type
and
copy
sent
to
all
employee
and
their
family
at
their
home
address
as
whitehead
explains
our
annual
review
be
be
issue
at
just
this
time
so
i
make
sure
we
clipped
our
business
principle
on
the
front
and
have
copy
sent
to
all
goldman
sachs
employee
home
and
just
to
be
sure
envelope
be
carefully
address
to
john
smith
family
so
they
and
the
member
of
their
family
could
read
them
and
enjoy
reflect
with
some
pride
on
the
nature
of
the
firm
with
which
they
be
associate
we
thought
the
wife
and
child
of
our
employee
would
enjoy
see
what
kind
of
firm
their
men

work
for
and
what
value
they
live
by
at

recognize
that
many

we
get
great
feedback
on
this
particularly
in
quite
move

from

the
principle
have

the

everything

of

in

i
be
simply
put
down
on
paper
the
thing
that
we
really
live
for
there
as
long
as
i
could
remember
and
try
to
foster
whitehead
say
in
a
follow
through
typical
of
his
persistence
each
department
head
be
told
to
assemble
all
his
department
s
employee
for
a
public
reading
of
the
principle
our
client
interest
always
come
first
if
we
serve
client
well
our
own
success
will
follow
we
stress
creativity
an
open
discussion
in
small
group
of
what
the
principle
really
meant
in
that
particular
department
s
day
to
day
work
experience
be
to
follow
so
everyone
would
see
how
those
abstraction
could
be
make
operational
in
their
own
particular
work
the
discussion
might
run
on
bidding
for
block
of
stock
for
example
if
the
price
be
really
good
for
our
client
the
institution
be
it
really
the
right
price
for
goldman
sachs
to
buy
at
and
what
if
the
price
drop
after
we
ve
bought
it
formal
minute
of
these
discussion
be
to
be
prepared
in
some
detail
and
submit
by
the
department
head
to
the
management
committee
for
review
even
whitehead
s
admirer
be
skeptical
that
such
obedience
be
ever
fully
achieve
but
it
would
be
hard
to
find
any
other
organization
where
so
much
prominence
and
serious
attention
be
give
to
a
corporate
belief
statement
for
so
many
consecutive
year
the
business
principle
be
not
just
about
the
style
of
the
firm
or
its
culture
explains
roy
smith
they
lay
out
a
series
of
dictum
about
how
to
conduct
business
and
how
to
be
truly
professional
consider
that
john
be
then
an
important
but
not
a
lead
partner
it
be
all
the
more
audacious
to
compose
and
promulgate
this
set
of
rule
for
success
whitehead
mention
that
he
s
still
somewhat
surprised
by
the
organizational
significance
the
principle
have
acquire
say
since
investment
banking
skill
be
pretty
much
comparable
among
the
major
wall
street
firm
it
help
to
be
recognize
as
a
firm
that
be
unusual
in
its
focus
on
be
ethical
the
principle
be
an
easy
target
for
those
who
think
they
be
too
many
some
argue
that
nobody
can
implement
so
many
belief
with
sufficient
rigor
and
vigor
to
make
all
of
them
equally
important
as
steve
friedman
put
it
year
later
when
you
be
wake
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
how
many
principle
can
you
rattle
off
while
you
re
just
come
awake
three
maybe
four
that
s
where
we
should
all
focus
so
they
be
always
on
our
mind
and
in
our
thought
others
appreciate
the
comprehensive
construction
as
roy
smith
put
it
those
principle
be
a
complete
prescription
of
the
firm
s
business
strategy
no
other
firm
in
the
security
business
and
almost
certainly
no
other
firm
in
any
business
can
say
and
mean
those
statement
because
they
cannot
commit
to
and
live
by
all
of
them
but
those
simple
declarative
sentence
describe
the
essential
nature
of
goldman
sachs
and
they
explain
how
and
why
the
firm
really
work
the
principle
not
only
imply
an
overarch
business
strategy
for
goldman
sachs
they
provide
clear
guidance
on
operational
tactic
my
commitment
to
the
corporate
culture
at
goldman
sachs
be
certainly
not
religious
say
gene
fife
it
s
because
it
s
a
very
smart
way
to
do
very
good
business
while
some
other
banking
firm
try
to
manage
and
control
with
top
down
rule
a
rule
base
management
couldn
t
possibly
keep
up
with
the
speed
of
change
in
the
security
business
and
couldn
t
penetrate
the
complexity
of
many
different
line
of
business
in
many
different
market
to
address
specific
situation
where
value
base
decision
might
be

with
a
principle

responsibility
for
decision
be
push
down
to
the
men
and
woman
on
the
fire
line
since
they
know
the
concept
of
the
principle
and
they
know
the
detailed
reality
of
their
specific

they
can
be
held
accountable
for

and
do
the
right

in
the
right
way
hard
decision
about
do
the
right

be
always
in
the
gray
zone
and
usually
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
that
gray
zone
and
they
come
up
for
action
much
too
quickly
for
leisurely
deliberation
action
must
be
swift
the
tight
loose
management
that
be
so
clearly
expect
and
express
by
the
principle
distributes
decision
make
responsibility
very
widely
throughout
the
firm
without
senior
management
ever
delegate
its
final
authority
try
to
formulate
all
the
rule
that
might
be
need
would
produce
such
inconvenient
bulk
like
the
irs
manual
that
only
a
few
could
ever
figure
thing
out
even
if
they
have
all
the
time
in
the
world
the
principle
have
become
totemic
because
they
work
never
content
to
be
a
one

whitehead
put
out
another
set
of
guideline

these
be
ten

obviously

so
be
work
harder

the

minimize

goldman
sachs
be
almost
always
alone
in
the
early
day
of

it

he

the

well
together

have
great
respect
and
affection
for

both
be
alpha

a
contest
choice
between
the

natural

could
have
hurt
the

john

in
strategic
planning
the

innovation
in

his
considerable
visibility
in
washington
and
in
the

banking
association
and
his
initiative
within
the
firm
in
promulgate
the
principle
and
in
recruiting
public
relation
and
organize
and
upgrade
internal
operation
all
these
make
him
in
his
own
mind
and
the
mind
of
others
the
natural
first
choice
but
whitehead
have
to
know
he
could
only
succeed
in
the
senior
partner
role
if
he
have
the
explicit
support
of
his
friend
he
knew
that
many
partner
have
strong
positive
feeling
about
weinberg
warm
affectionate
feeling
that
differ
from
their
cool
respectful
feeling
about
him
outside
the
firm
whitehead
be
generally
recognize
as
the
strategic
and
conceptual
leader
insider
like
weinberg
well
john
whitehead
be
clearly
a
brilliant
strategist
say
one
partner
but
he
didn
t
have
that
connectedness
that
s
so
often
vital
to
great
leadership
john
weinberg
understood
people
well
than
anyone
else
in
the
firm
say
ray
young
like
his
father
before
him
john
would
get
it
right
with
people
they
knew
they
could
trust
him
and
his
decision
john
whitehead
be
very
ambitious
and
always
have
his
own
agenda
we
be
all
ambitious
but
our
ambition
be
for
the
firm
john
whitehead
care
about
recognition
for
his
personal
achievement
and
his
charitable
contribution
later
in
life
john
weinberg
probably
give
just
as
much
but
always
anonymously
the
consistently
cool
and
articulate
whitehead
aptly
described
as
a
gentleman
s
c
s
type
who
get
straight
a
s
be
calmly
guard
and
one
step
remove
from
others
as
he
concentrate
on
policy
and
strategy
in
contrast
to
weinberg
s
spontaneous
emotional
directness
and
earthy
candor
as
he
concentrate
on
transaction
whitehead
inspire
respect
weinberg
inspire
trust
and
affection
everyone
at
goldman
sachs
knew
where
and
why
weinberg
stood
on
every
decision
but
many
wonder
about
the
core
hidden
many
layer
behind
whitehead
s
smooth
exterior
it
be
amusingly
ironic
that
whitehead
the
patrician
have
to
work
his
way
through
school
while
weinberg
the
common
man
have
be
raise
in
affluence
and
go
to
all
the
right
school
deerfield
princeton
and
harvard
business
school
with
levy
go
everyone
expect
the
two
john
to
resolve
the
leadership
succession
whitehead
have
a
sensible
solution
the
two
john
would
take
turn
he
propose
a
first
me
then
you
sequence
in
firm
leadership
as
the
senior
of
the
two
john
he
would
succeed
levy
now
and
would
then
after
some
year
pas
the
baton
to
weinberg
and
move
on
to
a
career
in
washington
or
at
a
major
corporation
but
weinberg
didn
t
buy
it
what
could
easily
have
become
a
personal
him
or
me
confrontation
become
instead
one
of
the
great
personal
combination
in
management
as
whitehead
deftly
offer
a
different
proposal
the
two
john
could
lead
their
firm
together
as
co
senior
partner
force
a
him
or
me
choice
would
have
cause
division
within
the
firm
when
it
be
most
vulnerable
it
wasn
t
clear
who
would
have
won
and
in
any
case
there
be
too
much
important
work
for
any
one
leader
particularly
if
there
be
any
hurt
feeling
and
there
surely
would
have
be
some
weinberg
who
be
so
often
almost
instinctive
in
his
good
judgment
agree
immediately
to
what
must
have
seem
a
most
improbable
and
unworkable
managerial
proposition
to
those
who
first
heard
about
their
unusual
plan
in
fact
the
first
thread
lead
to
this
unique
proposition
be
in
gu
levy
s
will
levy
have
identify
the
two
john
as
coexecutors
of
his
estate
later
levy
take
this
thought
far
as
l
jay
tenenbaum
recall
when
i
ask
gu
who
he
have
identify
as
his
successor
he
told
me
of
his
plan
to
have
the
two
john
take
over
and
i
told
him
gu
that
won
t
work
at
all
well
you
have
to
have
one
guy
who
have
the
final
say
then
in
recognize
that
the
goldman
sachs
partnership
could
become
divide
with
some
partner
want
weinberg
and
some
want
whitehead
levy
announce
that
he
didn
t
want
to
choose
between
them
and
have
decide
to
endorse
our
usual
formula
for
success
in
virtually
all
endeavor
teamwork
symbolically
both
men
be
soon
name
coexecutors
of
levy
s
will
the
legend
within
the
firm
have
it
that
on
the
day
he
have
his
stroke
levy
have
a
memo
on
his
desk
about
the
advantage
of
the
two
john
succeed
him
together
the
official
announcement
of
levy
s
stroke
explain
that
weinberg
and
whitehead
would
serve
together
as
act
cochairmen
a
week
later
they
announce
they
would
serve
together
as
senior
partner
and
cochairmen
not
with
each
take
responsibility
for
half
the

as
others
might
have
do
but
with
both
take
undivided
responsibility
for
the
firm
as
a
whole
in
establish
their
dual
leadership
the
two
john
take
advantage
of
their
friendship
form
over
many
year
of
discuss
what
they
be
go
to
do
when
they
eventually
head
goldman
sachs
as
they
believe
they
would
while
eat
chicken
salad
sandwich
at
scottie
s
sandwich
shop
on
pine
street
if
either
have
a
strong
view
the
other
defer
so
they
maintain
broad
agreement
on
strategy
and
policy
the
eventual
decision
to
co
lead
goldman
sachs
soon
seem
as
natural
to
the
two
john
as
it
be
unusual
on
wall
street
weinberg
reminisce
during
one
summer
between
year
at
harvard
business
school
i
have
work
at
mckinsey
it
be
my
father
s
idea
and
a
good
one
i
get
to
know
marvin
bower
the
senior
partner
of
mckinsey
who
knew
a
lot
about
the
working
of
organization
when
he
heard
that
john
and
i
have
it
in
mind
to
serve
as
cochairmen
and
senior
partner
he
say
it
would
never
work
and
that
when
we
have
the
whole
firm
really
screw
up
he
d
come
down
and
help
us
unscrew
it
he
be
great
but
somehow
we
make
it
work
the
two
john
sustain
a
we
two
relationship
as
successful
parent
so
often
do
base
on
mutual
respect
and
different
priority
one
largely
internal
and
managerial
and
one
largely
external
with

and
avoid
competition
by

frequently
though
we
be
very
different

of

we
happen
to
be
very
simpatico
weinberg
once
explain
our

close
together
we
communicate
a
lot
we
really
wear
out
the
carpet

our

we
have
a
very
collegial
approach
to
management
of
the
firm
john
whitehead
and
i
think
very
much
alike
on
all
sort
of
thing
we
speak
on
the
phone
almost
every

we
talk
about
the
agenda
for
the
next
day

agree
on
what
we
need
to
do

to
all
at

at

competitive
not

and
not

but
competitive
intensity
come
naturally
to
them
both

combat
both
understood
how
successful

if
they

more

as

and
for
their

both
believe
in
understated

unrelenting
aggression
versus

and
both
believe
that
in
any
competition
the
organization
that

the
best
people
make
the
few
mistake
and

they

to

the

that

what
their
toughest
competitor
would
always
do
too
their
remarkable
partnership
and
friendship
have
its
origin
when
three
year
into
his
rapidly
rise
career
at
goldman
sachs
whitehead
be
told
by
sidney
weinberg
that
his
son
john
would
be
come
to
the
firm
for
the
summer
month
between
his
first
and
second
year
at
harvard
business
school
and
that
whitehead
should
show
him
the
rope
a
year
later
john
weinberg
join
the
firm
full
time
and
the
two
john
begin
the
person
to
person
partnership
that
last
over
thirty
five
year
the
two
men
become
partner
on
the
same
day
and
held
the
same
percentage
ownership
in
the
firm
throughout
their
career
in
the
begin
the
two
young
men
set
their
desk
back
to
back
in
the
squash
court
as
they
ate
chicken
salad
sandwich
at
scottie
s
each
day
they
talk
freely
and
exchange
thought
and
idea
on
virtually
everything
include
their
frustration
with
the
way
the
firm
be
not
run
whitehead
explains
we
be
only
serve
time
not
learn
much
and
certainly
not
work
at
our
capacity
john
and
i
be
resolve
to
put
much
more
responsibility
to
the
young
people
in
the
firm
as
they
talk
both
john
become
more
and
more
convince
that
they
knew
many
way
to
make
the
firm
strong
and
well
we
found
we
thought
alike
on
many
many
thing
we
have
the
same
hope
for
goldman
sachs
and
while
we
share
enormous
respect
and
affection
for
sidney
weinberg
we
share
major
frustration
with
him
too
the
firm
s
carefully
monitor
team
atmosphere
meant
there
be
few
of
the
petty
turf
battle
that
plague
the
rest
of
the
street
goldman
sachs
become
recognize
as
a
company
rather
than
a
collection
of
individual
that
act
more
like
an
organism
still
the
competition
for
advancement
particularly
to
partnership
that
would
go
to
only
a
few
be
intense
all
the
people
who
join
goldman
sachs
be
capable
and
hardworking
those
who
make
partner
have
to
make
a
large
commitment
to
the
firm
strive
more
devote
more
time
and
take
more
pressure
on
themselves
and
on
their
family
goldman
sachs
be
an
investment
banking
firm
that
add
on
trading
say
jim
gorter
so
do
morgan
stanley
salomon
brother
be
a
trading
firm
that
add
on
investment
banking
at
goldman
sachs
the
banker
generally
ran
the
firm
and
more
partner
come
from
banking
than
any
other
division
but
the
point
be
that
everyone
work
together
all
the
time
or
certainly
almost
all
the
time
because
as
in
any
situation
there
be
tension
to
work
out
the
concept
or
commitment
to
real
teamwork
and
no
star
because
star
denigrate
all
the
others
trace
right
back
to
gu
levy
but
be
brought
home
and
institutionalize
by
john
and
john
we
be
sort
of
shabby
in
our
office
and
low
key
low
visibility
in
term
of
personal
hero
say
partner
roy
smith
we
tend
to
resent
hero
if
any
be
to
emerge
because
we
all
knew
that
it
be
the
team
approach
the
phalanx
that
make
the
difference
plus
not
let
our
ego
get
out
of
line
we
produce
a
somewhat
hard
to
classify
mystique
of
efficiency
without
too
much
identity
that
sometimes
frustrate
us
when
we
felt
we
have
a
lesser
public
image
than
some
of
us
from
time
to
time
would
like
to
have
see
teamwork
be
mandatory
and
celebrate
i
as

i

that

clearly
to
be
avoid
everything

we
we
do
this
or
we
won
that
as
one
partner
quipped
the
i
word

so
strongly

that
some
people
won

even
go
to

an

doctor
teamwork
matter
to

philip
caldwell
explain
what
make
goldman
sachs
outstanding
first
they
know
their
business
second
they
don
t
seem
to
have
any
internal
struggle
or
strife
the
two
john
work
consistently
to
develop
the
leadership
and
management
capability
of
strong
performer
pair
of
young
future
leader

managerial
slot
to
see
how
they
would
perform
together
and
handle
share
power
and
responsibility
another
way
of
building
teamwork
be
to
share
the
profit
in
good
year
and
protect
people
in
bad
year
to
spread
participation
in
the
success
of
the
whole
firm
the
partner
contribute
percent
of

to
a
pool
divide
into
profit
share
in
a
program
administer
by
each
division
in
combination
with
salary
and
bonus
and
the
future
possibility
of
partnership
the
profit
share
be
an
important
part
of
the
firm
s
ability
to
make
an
attractive
economic
offer
to
prospective
associate
during
the
stock
market
doldrums
of
the
mid
seventy
when
the
firm
scramble
to
barely
break
even
layoff
be
avoid
and
not
only
be
decent
bonus
paid
out
widely
through
the
organization
but
young
partner
be
subsidize
so
they
could
make
it
through
the
adversity
really
be
there
for
people
when
it
matter
count
a
lot
in
the
organization
the
two
john
be
building
balance
be
key
say
partner
lee
cooperman
more
than
any
other
firm
goldman
sachs
have
strategic
and
organizational
balance
across
all
area
of
the
business
it
be
a
conglomerate
that
work
key
to
goldman
sachs
s
success
be
that
the
firm
not
only
have
great
balance
and
strength
it
also
share
the
benefit
of
that
balance
widely
within
the
firm
everybody
pull
on
his
own
oar
and
all
pull
together
everybody
be
part
of
and
all
believe
in
the
team
sure
there
be
some
politics
and
as
the
firm
grows
it
s
probably
increase
but
compare
to
any
other
firm
the
problem
of
politics
at
goldman
sachs
be
small
the
real
indicator
of
teamwork
and
cooperation
not
just
within
division
but
also
across
division
be
the
certainty
of
cooperation
and
the
speed
of
cooperation
say
cooperman
who
give
this
simple
example
a
lawyer
at
a
major
wall
street
firm
want
an
introduction
to
the
key
people
in
project
finance
at
goldman
sachs
and
ask
a
security
salesman
how
to
go
about
it
i
ll
find
out
for
you
the
lawyer
expect
to
hear
in
a
week
or
two
that
same
day
the
lawyer
be
call
with
a
confirm
appointment
already
set
up
the
lawyer
be
startle
but
that
s
typical
of
the
way
it
work
goldman
sachs
have
a
relatively
flat
organizational
structure
with
virtually
no
hierarchy
teamwork
interaction
and
swift
extensive
interdepartmental
communication
be
stress
one
of
the
first
lesson
taught
new
associate
be
post
be
there
anyone
else
in
the
firm
who
can
use
this
information
the
firm
developed
its
own
culture
base
on
management
by
owner
producer
and
a
highly
charge
intensely
meritocratic
environment
we
believe
we
be
the
financial
world
s
equivalent
of
a
team
of
professional
athlete
say
roy
smith
we
be
very
competitive
and
work
and
train
hard
we
be
good
at
what
we
do
and
want
to
be
the
best
the
world
champion
the
sustain
strive
that
be
so
essential
to
become
champion
need
to
be
balance
by
a
perspective
that
protect
the
firm
and
its
individual
from
go
too
far
ask
what
could
derail
the
firm
s
strategy
bob
rubin
be
candid
ego
arrogance
a
sense
of
self
importance
if
you
allow
them
to
develop
that
s
when
you
fall
off
the
track
when
the
firm
be
small
in
the
sixty
and
seventy
it
be
easy
to
recognize
the
really
bright
guy
say
george
doty
to
see
who
be
real
player
and
who
be
just
spectator
but
as
the
firm
grow
more
structure
communication
be
need
to
encourage
teamwork
and
to
be
sure
everyone
involve
in
the
important
transaction
be
fully
recognize
and
also
knew
how
important
the
contribution
of
others
have
be
whitehead
and
weinberg
insist
on
credit

to
specify
each
contributor

contribution
and
that
those
credit

could
feel
frustrate
there
be
two

of
those
memo
that
really
get
to
me
first
be
the
gee
i

and
almost
as
bad
be
the
my
people
be
so
great
type
with
the
all
too
obvious
implication
that
the
writer
must
be
a
superb
leader
to
have
so
inspire
his

for
you
to
carry
more
work
responsibility
perhaps
half
again
more
than
your
normal
capacity
because
that
meant
you
accumulate
more

you
would
learn
more
and
know
more
you
d
advance
up
the

curve
more
swiftly

sensible
business

despite
our
reputation
for

of

vision
he
be
tough
too
he
would
tell
people
what
to
do
without

around

become

it
do
business
continuity
of
strategic
vision
be
long
a
consistent
hallmark
in
whitehead
described
the
firm
s
objective
our
long
range
goal
be
to
become
a
truly
international
investment
banking
and
brokerage
firm
we
want
to
have
as
many
client
around
the
world
as
we
have
here
in
america
and
to
be
as
highly
respect
in
london
paris
zurich
and
tokyo
as
we
be
in
new
york
chicago
and
los
angeles
develop
franchise
earn
power
be
what
every
investment
banking
firm
look
for
explains
roy
smith
the
trick
be
to
maximize
risk
adjust
earn
power
as
a
firm
but
of
course
each
individual
be
look
for
maximum
earn
power
too
with
thousand
of
employee
each
make
his
own
trade
off
of
risk
versus
return
and
short
term
versus
long
term
and
individual
relative
to
firm
and
client
relationship
versus
specific
transaction
the
challenge
for
management
be
very
great
with
all
the
many
conflict
and
challenge
and
they
be
always
change
it
s
hard
to
find
and
sustain
harmony
and
balance
the
ultimate
risk
be
that
the
truly
great
individual
like
gu
levy
and
the
two
john
as
well
as
everybody
in
leadership
position
in
each
of
the
business
unit
will
feel
constrain
or
frustrate
by
the
organization
the
creative
genius
need
to
be
disruptive
and
different
to
be
truly
innovative
but
the
large
the
organization
get
the
more
it
will
seek
and
will
insist
on
get
order
and
stability
both
be
need
but
each
be
in
conflict
with
the
other
manage
these
conflict
be
what
real
management
be
all
about
in
the
security
business
the
challenge
compound
with
opportunity
seize
the
firm
grows
as
the
firm
get
big
it
s
harder
and
harder
to
recruit
or
fully
use
or
even
keep
the
remarkably
gift
creative
and
driven
individual
performer
almost
inevitably
there
be
an
institutional
harden
and
the
organization
ejects
the
great
individual
performer
even
though
it
be
the
great
individual
performer
of
the
past
who
enable
the
organization
to
create
growth
so
management
s
dilemma
be
that
the
organization
s
franchise
vital
to
maximize
long
term
risk
adjust
earnings
must
always
be
protect
from
the
short
term
urgency
of
specific
transaction
or
deal
protect
against
short
term
expediency
must
be
balance
against
the
opposite
problem
say
smith
if
you
re
too
conservative
you
ll
force
out
or
lose
the
great
individual
contributor
or
they
won
t
even
join
you
if
you
re
not
conservative
enough
individual
will
get
out
of
control
and
do
self
aggrandize
transaction
that
will
harm
the
whole
organization
the
more
complex
the
organization
and
its
business
the
more
difficult
this
vital
role
of
management
will
be
in
building
the
organization
they
want
goldman
sachs
to
be

i
be
in
some
danger
of
become
the
senior
partner
of
our
accounting
firm
be
forty
six
year
old
and
felt
i
have
the
world
by
the
throat
the
only
man
who
might
have
gotten
the
job
instead
of
me
say
he
would
be
glad
to
step
back
if
i
d
take
it
still
i
have
some
reservation
about
cooper
i
d
be
disappointed
to
see
how
that
firm
seem
to
prefer
cue
ball
as
partner
you
know
guy
who
have
nothing
wrong
with
them
and
who
be
smooth
operator
and
would
steer
away
from
make
partner
of
guy
who
might
be
awkward
or
have
fault
but
also
have
some
really
strong
talent
goldman
sachs
be
different
as
i
d
be
learn
at
my
naval
reserve
unit
where
john
whitehead
and
i
both
serve
as
officer
we
have
be
have
long
talk
about
how
to
build
up
a
truly
great
professional
firm
we
get
along
well
and
i
felt
he
really
have
something
go
at
goldman
sachs
whitehead
be
impressed
with
doty
s
detailed
knowledge
and
managerial
understand
of
the
operation
of
various
little
know
unit
in
what
most
investment
banker
rather
contemptuously
refer
to
as
the
cage
the
place
where
million

negotiable
security
be
handle
daily
which
be
why
it
have
heavy

screen
for
security
know
that
the
best
way
to
get
a
decision
make
and
implement
be
to
set
it
up
carefully
and
then
hand
it
off
to
sidney
weinberg
whitehead
introduce
doty
to
weinberg
when
sidney
invite
me
to
lunch
recall
doty
his
timing
be
perfect
still
i
told
him
i
have
real
doubt
it
s
not
religion
be
it
he
ask
me
i
m
irish
catholic
i
assure
him
that
religion
wasn
t
it
my
family
be
leave
for
a
long
plan
vacation
and
i
promise
to
give
him
my
answer
when
we
return
sound
like
a
furniture
store
be
my
wife
s
first
reaction
she
be
think
of
saks
fifth
avenue
but
the
plain
truth
be
the
firm
be
not
very
well
know
back
then
goldman
sachs
be
not
as
profitable
as
the
other
firm
i
knew
but
the
firm
be
always
more
professional
always
strive
to
do
what
be
best
for
the
client
convince
that
if
the
firm
really
solve
the
client
problem
for
them
in
the
long
run
everything
would
work
out
well
for
the
firm
this
may
be
a
somewhat
archaic
concept
but
it
have
put
the
firm
in
a
truly
respect
role
other
firm
be
then
and
be
now
more
cash
register
orient
from
the
day
of
his
arrival

as

of
the

management
committee
and
have
the
fourth
large
partnership
percentage
after
gu
levy
and
the
two
john
he
be
powerful
partly
because
he
built
an
encyclopedic
knowledge
of
how
the
increasingly
complex
organization
of
goldman
sachs
work
and
could
be
make
to
work
partly
because
others
do
not
have
that
knowledge
partly
because
operational
efficiency
and
effectiveness
be
become
decisive
in
determine
the
firm
s
ability
to
make
strategic
choice
and
fulfill
objective
while
compete
with
other
organization
in
a
faster
pace
and
increasingly
complex
business
and
partly
because
doty
be
tough
tenacious
and
unflappable
even
in
develop
an
internal
financial
management
organization
the
two
john
be
competitively
aggressive
once
hire
some
financial
manager
from
merrill
lynch
because
they
thought
goldman
sachs
would
learn
a
lot
about
the
competitor
s
presumably
advanced
financial
management
system
only
to
be
surprised
to
learn
how
little
sophistication
that
competitor
have
develop
talent
from
within
the
two
john
make
jonathan
cohen
their
chief
of
staff
and
a
partner
because
they
have
learn
they
could
trust
him
with
anything
john
weinberg
once
joked
jon
when
we
leave
you
ll
know
so
much
we
ll
just
have
to
kill
you
while
whitehead
and
weinberg
be
consider
conservative
as
firm
leader
doty
be
very
conservative
in
manage
internal
operation
much
as
i
admire
and
like
george
he
could
be
awfully
negative
about
new
thing
recall
whitehead
more
than
a
few
time
i
have
to
take
him
aside
and
say
now
george
new
idea
be
quite
fragile
in
their
newness
you
really
must
be
careful
because
there
be
always
more
people
who
can
kill
a
new
idea
than
there
be
people
who
can
help
it
grow
up
from
something
hopeful
but
still
quite
young
and
weak
into
something
truly
useful
he
would
lobby
other
partner
to
organize
resistance
to
thing
we
want
to
get
accomplish
whitehead
add
with
a
smile
and
he
could
get
me
pretty
irritated
too
doty

all
about
control

for
him

the
two
john
worried
about

and
one
of

s
major
contribution
be
his
successful
lobbying
to
extend
the
life
of

the
federal
law
that

the

in
the
way
the

at

weinberg
direct
and
blunt
as
ever
simply
say
because
they
ll
screw
it
up
whitehead
then
rise
to
give
a
typically
erudite
and
articulate
and
in
this
case
lengthy
explanation
of
the
significant
difference
in
culture
capital
people
management
and
strategic
priority
until
he
pause
look
over
at
weinberg
smile
broadly
and
say
just
as
john
say
they
ll
screw
it
up
john
and
john
never
have
a
conflict
say
bob
steel
at

nobody
ever
saw
any
conflict
whatsoever
they
be
each
very
comfortable
be
who
they
be
different
as
they
really
be
with
weinberg
instinctive
and
spontaneous
and
whitehead
the
very
model
of
self
control
and
circumspection
and
without
any
jealousy
of
each
other
s
success
the
two
john
could
have
make
all
the
decision
but
they
chose
to
respect
the
strong
group
they
have
assemble
on
the

committee

jim

steve

and
the
committee
member
appreciate
the
respectful
way
they
be
treat
by
the
two
john
so
they
take
their
responsibility
seriously
and
be
certainly
not
yes
men
still
it
be
understood
that
department
head
be
generally
free
to
run
their
different

their
own
way
there

almost

there

he

out

none
of

be
well
at
what
we

without
the
diversion
of
be
in

that
we
be
not
comfortable
with
i

from
thirty
percent
to
thirty
five
percent
in
something
you
be

weinberg

be
particularly
careful
not
to
build
up

avoid

for
the

risk
as
bob
rubin
observe
at
the
time
our
approach
be
dull
but
it
s
not
a
bad
way
to
run
a
business
the
two
john
be
always
in
there
do
the
business
with
the
others
never
insulate
from
either
the
business
or
the
other
partner
you
can
t
overvalue
those
two
guy

they
have
their

classic

i
think
that

peel
off
slowly
say
bob

i
think
that
we
clearly
have
a
label
of
be
somewhere
between
cautious
and
maybe
overly
cautious
and
i
think
that

in
the
late

confirm
that
view
of
the

later
when
he
and

historically
that

not

will

leadership
of
all
the

brought
about
by
the

perhaps
the
great
be
a
profound
shift
of
attitude
and
self
perception
in
the
mind
of
their
partner
at
the

separate

for

largely
confine
to

middle

company
particularly
those
that
might
decide
to
sell
out
by
the
time
the
two
john
step
down
the

be
on
its
way
to
be

the

in

with
the
lead
american

it
be
poise
for
expansion
to
global
leadership
ironically
it
would
be
the
remarkable
combine
success
of
the
new
line
of
business
spearhead
by
the
two
john
and
of
the
firm
as
a
whole
that
would
convince
their
successor
that
goldman
sachs
should
go
public
a
decision
the
two
john
would
vigorously
and
unsuccessfully
oppose
after
their
time
of
leadership
have
pass
whitehead
and
weinberg
make
one
of
their
great
contribution
to
goldman
sachs
by
agree
out
of
their
great
mutual
respect
and
personal
affection
not
to
take
one
particular
action
that
example
of
deference
to
partnership
literally
save
goldman
sachs
from
disaster
through
his
work
with
the
new
york
port
authority
john
whitehead
learn
of
an
unusually
attractive
opportunity
to
lease
a
large
block
of
open
architecture
floor
space
ideal
for
a
large
trading
operation
near
the
top
of
one
of
the
major
building
in
the
wall
street
area
this
one
lease
would
allow
everyone
in
the
firm
to
work
together
on
connect
floor
in
one
major
building
with
a
spectacular
view
the
lease
would
run
for
twenty
five
year
well
into
the
twenty
first
century
the
financial
term
be
attractive
the
firm
clearly
need
substantial
new
space
in
the
wall
street
area
and
the
time
have
come
for
goldman
sachs
to
set
aside
its
past
penchant
for
low
key
shabby
office
the
physical
space
be
perfect
and
be
headquarter
in
that
iconic
space
would
be
a
perfect
symbolic
declaration
goldman
sachs
have
become
a
dominant
global
leader
in
investment
banking
whitehead
sketch
out
the
splendid
opportunity
but
he
could
see
that
weinberg
be
for
some
reason
not
buying
in
so
out
of
respect
for
his
partner
he
decide
to
let
the
subject
drop
for
a
week
or
so
because
it
be
not
all
that
time
urgent
he
would
give
his
friend
time
to
get
on
board
give
time
the
idea
itself
be
sure
to
win
weinberg
s
enthusiastic
support
a
week
later
whitehead
brought
it
up
again
but
get
even
less
interest
so
he
defer
for
another
week
when
he
brought
it
up
a
third
time
weinberg
surprised
whitehead
by
say
he
knew
whitehead
have
brought
the
matter
up
twice
before
and
seem
quite
excite
about
his
deal
but
even
without
get
into
the
detail
he
would
never
support
such
a
move
whitehead
want
to
know
why
so
weinberg
explain
i
get
claustrophobic
when
i
m
in
a
building
where
the
window
be
seal
and
can
t
be
open
the
window
in
that
building
be
all
seal
and
the
space
you
ve
be
look
at
be
ninety
floor
high
john
i
could
never
work
in
that
building
i
can
t
possibly
work
way
up
there
with
window
you
can
t
open
with
that
very
human
explanation
whitehead
defer
to
his
friend
and
they
never
spoke
again
about
lease
floor
for
the
whole
firm
near
the
top
of
one
world
trade

the
early
year
bond

be
not
important
to
goldman
sachs
in
the
fifty
and
sixty
and
goldman
sachs
be
certainly
not
important
to

until
gu

read
salomon

it
show
him
that
a

the

very
small

which
goldman

most
certainly

levy

what

with
hundred
of
corporate
issuer
and
thousand
of
institutional
investor
as
usual
he
be
unrelenting
in
his
drive
to
make
it
all
come
together
he
saw
goldman
sachs
as
the
sleep
giant
in
bond
all
it
need
he
thought
be
to
be
rouse
from
slumber
and
taught
how
to
change
we
ve
expand
our
bond
business
recently
say
levy
in
we
plan
to
be
number
one
in
the
bond
business
we
never
plan
to
be
number
two
in
anything
at
levy
s
direction
george
ross
lead
a
partner
committee
in
a
major
study
of
the
business
possibility
in
corporate
bond
it
show
that
opportunity
for
large
profit
be
significant
in
both
underwriting
and
deal
in
the
secondary
market
so
levy
summon
ross
from
philadelphia
to
take
over
from
fowler
and
run
the
bond
business
out
of
new
york
levy
s
charge
it
s
a
big
business
and
a
big
opportunity
for
goldman
sachs
but
ross
do
not
do
well
in
bond
he
be
too
interested
in
friendly
client
relationship
to
succeed
in
the
confrontational
arena
of
the
bond
business
so
he
go
back
to
philadelphia
after
two
year
and
john
weinberg
be
put
in
his
place
reporting
to
ray
young
gu
put
me
in
charge
of
the
bond
department
recall
weinberg
i
object
gu
i
don
t
know
bond
but
gu
say
you
know
how
to
control
the
trader
so
you
re
it
and
that
be
that
weinberg
s
main
job
be
to
find
the
right
leader
to
build
a
major
bond
business
so
i
start
look
around
at
our
guy
and
quickly
realize
that
we
didn
t
have
anyone
who
could
be
a
real
leader
then
i
find
a
guy
at
salomon
bill
simon
who
be
later
secretary
of
the
treasury
and
be
go
to
hire
him
when
our
trader
threaten
to
quit
if
i
hire
anyone
in
over
them
i
m
not
about
to
be
threaten
by
those
clown
so
i
laid
it
out
clear
and
easy
you
guy
have
fifteen
minute
to
come
to
me
and
say
we
ll
go
along
with
you
and
really
support
this
new
guy
as
our
head
or
out
you
go
so
most
of
them
left
that
very
same
day
fine
with
me
then
simon
get
a
big
counteroffer
from
salomon
brother
and
decide
not
to
move
to
goldman
sachs
the
next
day
i
m
desperate
to
find
somebody
who
can
take
the
responsibility
for
manage
our
bond
position
when
i
remember
eric
sheinberg
be
run
our
convertible
operation
convertible
be
bond
so
i
go
tell
sheinberg
he
s
get
a
new
job
he
argues
that
convert
be
almost
completely
different
from
straight
bond
they
re
much
closer
to
common
stock
but
i
say
cut
that
you
ve
be
draft
so
he
accepts
the
inevitable
and
agrees
to
run
the
bond
position
for
a
while
while
we
go
look
for
someone
else
someone
who
can
really
do
the
job
and
put
us
into
taxable
bond
in
a
major
way
but
taxable
bond
be
only
one
area
of
the
bond
business
while
weinberg
be
look
for
a
new
head
of
taxable
bond
a
separate
effort
be
be
make
in
tax
exempt
municipals
john
whitehead
have
recruit
bob
downey
whom
he
have
met
socially
to
leave
r
w
pressprich
where
he
be
work
in
municipals
to
lead
a
major
buildup
in
municipal
bond
at
goldman
sachs
as
a
lifelong
republican
whitehead
s
proposition
be
that
municipal
finance
be
sure
to
grow
because
the
state
and
municipality
would
need
the
money
particularly
with
the
democrat
in
power
downey
be
so
persuade
to
focus
on
the
excite
future
opportunity
whitehead
project
that
he
take
a
significant
pay
cut
do
it
right
be
whitehead
s
charge
to
downey
you
don
t
have
to
do
it
all
at
once
or
achieve
everything
this
year
don
t
stretch
be
the
best
but
despite
those
word
downey
understood
goldman
sachs
s
drive
of
course
we
work
our
ass
off
because
we
knew
in
the
final
analysis
that
john
really
expect
the
business
to
grow
rapidly
and
put
goldman
sachs
at
the
top
of
the
league
table
very
quickly
and
that
he
require
we
do
it
in
a
first
class
way
at
the
time
it
be
not
at
all
obvious
that
goldman
sachs
would
be
a
significant
beneficiary
of
the
expect
increase
in
municipal
bond
volume
in
the
year
downey
take
over
the
firm
be
not
even
in
the
top
fifty
among
new
issue
municipal
underwriter
as
usual
break
into
the
municipal
bond
business
would
require
an
imaginative
new
product
an
innovative
marketing
focus
and
a
sustain
drive
commitment
the
first
major
advance
come
in
when
goldman
sachs
invent
the
vermont
state
municipal
bond
bank
which
enable
small
municipality
across
the
green
mountain
state
to
gain
access
to
the
municipal
bond
market
on
much
more
favorable
term
than
they
ever
could
get
for
their
individual
financing
as
downey
explain
small
issue
get
no
attention
from
wall
street
or
from
investor
for
example
one
bond
be
issue
for
peach
vermont
with
a
population
of
only
the
vermont
bank
the
traditional
buyer
for
small
local
issue
be
out
of
money
to
buy
local
bond
so
there
be
no
market
for
peach
s
bond
without
the
bond
bank
the
vermont
bond
bank
offer
bond
issue
of
at
least
medium
size
which
make
them
liquid
or
tradable
in
the
secondary
bond
market
by
pool
numerous
municipality
small
bond
offering
and
add
the
imprimatur
of
the
state
of
vermont
which
have
a
triple
a
credit
rating
while
the
state
wasn
t
legally
responsible
for
the
bond
bank
s
debt
the
bank
s
credit
be
base
on
the
state
s
moral
obligation
and
be
rat
double
a
the
key
to
success
with
this
innovation
be
coordination
put
it
all
together
and
make
it
work
politically
and
then
financially
by
align
payment
date
and
handle
default
among
other
thing
we
go
to
lot
and
lot
of
town
meeting
and
met
with
lot
of
town
selectman
recall
downey
that
december
we
raise
a
total
of
forty
six
million
dollar
for
fifty
different
municipality
and
we
be
off
and
run
with
our
well
idea
we
brought
maine
in
two
year
later
with
the
maine
bond
bank
in
building
the
firm
s
municipal
bond
business
not
do
the
wrong
thing
be
almost
as
important
as
do
innovative
thing
for
instance
credit
analysis
be
an
important
part
of
the
firm
s
strategy
in
municipals
but
we
didn
t
publish
our
report
say
downey
because
we
didn
t
want
to
miff
our
issue
client
merrill
lynch
and
others
do
publish
and
they
get
into
real
trouble
with
their
publish
research
on
client
instead
he
explains
we
would
privately
show
a
list
of
the
dud
we
have
avoid
like
west
virginia
turnpike
while
it
s
not
good
to
get
a
reputation
for
be
too
cautious
or
even
chicken
it
s
always
important
to
know
when
to
say
no
and
say
no
be
not
the
last
thing
you
can
ever
say
because
you
can
always
come
back
to
the
table
you
don
t
want
to
be
just
some
idiot
who
be
only
avoid
bullet
you
do
want
to
compete
so
just
like
in
the
marine
you
have
to
know
when
to
duck
and
when
to
move
up
and
engage
sometimes
you
duck
first
and
then
engage
on
the
very
same
issue
downey
like
to
take
astute
market
risk
when
executive
life
which
ceo
fred
carr
would
later
drive
into
a
spectacular
bankruptcy
issue
insured
guaranteed
investment
contract
or
gics
they
get
a
triple
a
credit
rating
the
money
invest
in
those
gics
come
mostly
from
municipality
that
raise
money
through
tax
exempt
bond
sell
through
drexel
burnham
the
municipality
be
profit
at
least
temporarily
from
arbitrage
the
interest
rate
spread
between
the
tax
exempt
and
taxable
bond
market
but
recall
downey
even
in
a
large
diversified
portfolio
junk
bond
be
not
triple
a
so
we
stayed
far
away
from
the
executive
life
issue
when
originally
offer
at
par
but
later
after
executive
life
hit
the
skid
at
a
market
price
of
just
forty
dollar
for
every
hundred
dollar
of
face
value
those
same
bond
be
sell
at
a
sixty
percent
discount
and
we
go
in
at
that
market
price
and
do
beautifully
as
the
price
later
rise
to
eighty
still
there
be
moment
the
price
of
those
bond
once
drop
briefly
to
twenty
five
dollar
on
a
rumor
that
the
court
might
rule
that
secondary
market
investor
be
just
speculator
and
would
not
be
treat
equally
with
the
somehow
more
legitimate
investor
who
have
bought
at
the
offering
fortunately
for
those
who
bought
in
between
forty
and
fifty
dollar
that
rumor
soon
evaporate
by
say
no
back
at
the
original
underwriting
we
have
a
leg
up
when
it
be
time
to
organize
the
bailout
financing
downey
say
it
be
hard
work
but
we
really
do
our
homework
and
earn
a
reputation
for
professionalism
with
our
reputation
establish
business
be
really
come
in
and
the
municipal
finance
department
be
make
real
money
confident
that
the
firm
would
recognize
the
unit
s
success
in
municipals
downey
and
others
expect
municipal
finance
to
win
its
first
partnership
but
it
didn
t
quite
happen
the
division
get
one
partnership
for
a
banker
name
charlie
herman
we
be
very
disappointed
because
we
believe
very
strongly
that
our
frank
coleman
be
too
good
to
pas
over
so
we
write
a
letter
to
gu
say
we
truly
believe
goldman
sachs
be
the
best
firm
but
we
want
you
to
see
our
department
as
be
important
to
the
firm
we
get
no
reaction
from
gu
and
certainly
no
promise
disappointment
spread
quickly
across
the
municipal
group
downey
and
his
five
man
team
decide
that
if
partnership
be
not
go
to
open
up
at
goldman
sachs
they
have
well
talk
with
other
firm
after
three
month
of
carefully
confidential
discussion
they
agree
to
leave
goldman
sachs
and
go
over
to
donaldson
lufkin
jenrette
because
the
formal
announcement
would
be
make
the
next
day
their
wife
have
just
receive
big
bouquet
of
welcome
aboard
flower
it
look
all
settle
when
dan
lufkin
chairman
of
dlj
ask
his
partner
have
you
spoken
with
gu
no
why
as
a
courtesy
because
that
s
the
way
it
s
traditionally
do
on
wall
street
if
you
haven
t
call
gu
i
will
and
off
he
go
to
make
the
call
when
levy
get
the
courtesy
call
on
the
do
deal
his
sixth
sense
give
him
the
intuition
that
the
deal
for
his
municipal
finance
team
to
leave
goldman
sachs
and
join
dlj
be
not
absolutely
airtight
during
that
simple
courtesy
call
levy
kept
the
conversation
go
personalize
it
some
and
then
move
on
to
other
related
topic
get
lufkin
who
have
political
ambition
and
might
someday
need
levy
s
support
within
the
republican
party
to
blink
no
lufkin
indicate
it
be
not
quite
absolutely
lock
up
as
a
percent
do
deal
that
small
opening
be
all
gu
levy
need
he
call
downey
down
to
his
office
and
go
to
work
on
him
get
downey
first
to
wonder
and
then
to
worry
about
how
much
he
could
really
trust
the
other
firm
if
they
would
talk
to
levy
without
first
clearing
such
a
sensitive
call
with
him
when
s
the
last
time
you
give
your
wife
a
gift
of
something
really
nice
ask
levy
as
he
write
out
a
personal
check
for
ten
thousand
dollar
less
than
half
an
hour
after
lufkin
s
call
to
levy
downey
be
on
the
phone
to
dlj
say
your
chairman
told
gu
levy
that
our
deal
be
not
close
and
within
hour
the
deal
completely
unraveled
downey
and
his
municipal
finance
team
stayed
with
goldman
sachs
and
soon
get
that
second
partnership
by
the
end
of
the
twentieth
century
negotiate
municipal
bond
deal
have
grown
to
represent
over
three
quarter
of
the
overall
tax
exempt
market
and
goldman
sachs
ranked
first
in
lead
manage
negotiate
bond
underwritings
in
all
but
five
of
the
century
s
last
thirty
year
still
need
strong
sale
leadership
in
taxable
bond
weinberg
reach
for
a
young
star

effective
when

with
high
net
worth
client
he
must
have
good

month
later

approach
a

when
they
correctly
sense
that
smeal
be
no
longer
a
lead
candidate
to
be
chosen
ceo
of

and
might
be
receptive
to
their
offer
but
smeal
refuse
as
he
later
explain
i
wouldn

after
gu

it

different
the
change
in

be
one
major
factor
in

another
difference
be
that

just
be
badly
disappointed
when

make
he
be

make
real
progress
however
the
whole
world
of
bond
deal
be
about
to
go
through
a
once
in
a
lifetime
transformation
and
as
others
would
soon
see
the
service
intensive
strategy
smeal
understood
best
would
be
push
aside

trading
buying

the
transformation

would
bring
important
opportunity
for

entirely
new
way

difficulty
his
experience
at

have
be
in

the
major
business
challenge
at

out
how
goldman

could
join

in
the

business
a
strong

position
in
the

have
become
essential
when
compete

be
boom
not
be
a

be
already
hurt
the

competitively
and
without
major

would
become
a
dominate
strategic
liability
in
corporate
underwriting
all
the
other
major
be
strong
in
both

no

underwriter
moreover
if

be
make

like
proprietary

in

kind
of

those

would
surely
be
use
to
move
in
on
other
line
of

to
pay
up
in
recruiting
talented

frank

retire
this
open
up
an

steve

recall
i
couldn
t
sit
on
the
management
committee
with
smeal
and
not
know
that
something
be
miss
something
really
important
when
he
talk
about
london
have
lose
twelve
million
dollar
on
a
trade
and
didn
t
even
know
why
they
have
to
know
why
they
d
take
such
a
loss
so
they
could
learn
from
the
mistake
so
it
could
be
prevent
the
next
time
i
knew
that
tom
saunders
at
morgan
stanley
have
everyone
and
everything
reporting
into
him
on
the
trading
floor
so
they
have
close
communication
and
good
coordination
by
contrast
we
have
guy
spread
across
three
different
floor
talk
about

a
year
later
bob

again
he
want
ford
to

and
take

management
again
you
re
really
ask
two
different
thing
ford
respond
first
will
i
take
the
job
second
will
i
move
to
new

if
you
can
judge
my
work
by
the
result
accomplish
and
not
by
how
much
face
time
i
put
in
in
new

i
ll
take
it
but
only
on
that
basis
i
ll
want
to
discus
this
with
steve
can
i
put
you
on
hold
sure
ford
be
on
hold
for
less
than
one
minute
and
would
never
know
whether
rubin
actually
ask
friedman
anything
before
come
back
on
the
line
to
say
do
to

effective
ford
knew
he
would
need
to

be
the
work
of
stanley

come

buying

unfortunately
diller
need
enormous
amount
of
computer
time
to
run
his
complex
model
and
this
cause
conflict
with
others
in
research
when
diller
lose
his
temper
one
day
and
call
lee
cooperman
a

his
career
at
the

business
and
catch
up
with
salomon

to
trade

kirschbaum
recruit
robert
from
a

hedge
their

they

issue
be
sell

divide

like
slice
in
a
loaf
of

with
this
simple
insight
he
would
accumulate
a
big
position
in
those
initial
maturity
strip
buying
in
the
float
supply
and
then
squeeze
the

this
cause
major
spike
in
market
price
that
only
the

profit
for
goldman
sachs
soon
kirschbaum

the

have
some
of
the

their

like
me
as

john
weinberg
be
set
appoint
steve
friedman
to
head

but
bob
rubin
heard
about
it
and
quickly
convince
weinberg
to
appoint
him
as
cohead
to
be
sure
trading
skill
would
be
at
the
top
of
the
division
look
back
on
frank
smeal
s
departure
friedman
recall
our
bond
business
be
really
disturb
it
have
the
wrong
strategy
frank
be
go
backward
not
forward
when
recommend
a
relationship
salesman
to
succeed
him
as
head
of
the
division
we
say
over
our
dead
body
smeal
s
candidate
be
not
up
on
the
sophisticated
analytics
that
be
become
central
to
proprietary
trading
and
be
sure
to
be
the
main
source
of

one
month
after
bob
and
i
get
involve
a
major
crisis
hit
the
market
the
fix
income
division
be
all
stovepipe
and
fiefdom
so
trader
be
look
only
at
one
part
of
the
market
and
pay
no
attention
to
how
other
part
of
the
market
be
affect
their
own
they
have
no
understand
of
the
basic
mathematics
of
embed
option
value
such
as
call
protection
or
mortgage
refinance
right
which
be
absolutely
essential
the
top
of
that
division
be
an
intellectual
vacuum
rubin
and
friedman
change
the
compensation
arrangement
from
straight
commission
on
volume
to
manage
comp
that
could
at
least
include
whether
the

want
the
business
a
salesman
be
do
we
have
guy
get
paid
on
volume
when
the
key
to
their
volume
be
our
loss
in
market
make
lament
friedman
in
convince
that
new
leadership
and
new
strategy
be
need
in
fix

rubin
and
friedman
recruit
a
group
of
experienced
risk
take
bond
dealer
from
salomon
brother
into
goldman
sachs
to
force
change
in
the
fix

s
culture
and
alter
its
concept
of
the

from
service
orient
and
risk
avoid
over
to
a
bold
risk
embrace
capital
intensive
proprietary
business
model
most
left
salomon
brother
because
they
have
felt
shortchanged
and
most
subsequently
left
goldman
sachs
after
a
few
year
because
they
couldn
t
adapt
to
the
teamwork
culture
but
by
then
they
have
already
help
change
the
firm
s
way
of
do
bond
business
by
over
one
thousand
people
work
in
fix
income
think
more
rationally
and
in
more
sophisticated
way
be
not
limited
to
tactical
change
the
change
that
rubin
and
friedman
put
through
be
massive
and
would
help
change
the
character
of
goldman
sachs
forever
but
favorable
change
do
not
come
swiftly
or
easily
as
interest
rate
fell
in
dealer
with
long
position
in
corporate
bond
and
mortgage
back
security
be
not
get
the
rise
price
they
have
expect
but
their
short
position
in
u
s
treasury
be
rise
right
on
schedule
so
goldman
sachs
dealer
be
take
huge
repetitive
loss
arbitrage
loss
in
fix
income
surge
to
one

not
a
good
start
for
rubin
and
friedman
as
new
coheads
of
the

what
in
hell
be
go
on
exclaim
friedman
nobody
knew
and
nobody
knew
for

why
the

not
rise
as
rapidly
as
their
short

in

squeeze
the
spread
that
dealer
be
counting
on
goldman
sachs
need
well
model
that
more
accurately
reflect
the
impact
of

on
the
different

embed

this
need
surface
during
one
of
the
postmortem
review
session
rubin
held
each
saturday
he
always
make
sure
that
each
person
present
have
his
chance
to
speak
include
in
house
guru
fischer

the

of
the

sat
in
a
corner
and

listen
rubin
who
respect
people
who
like
himself
knew
how
to

say
fischer
you
ve
be
pretty
quiet
be
there
anything
you
d
like
to
add
note
that
the

be
not
be
value
correctly
black
say
that
correct
valuation
of
those
embed

could
probably
be
obtain
if
the
quantitative
model
builder
at
the

go
to
work
on
the
problem
while
the
black

couldn
t
work
well
on

over
the
next
several
week
work
with
emanuel
derman
and
bill
toy
black
developed
a
practical
computer
model
that
incorporate
the
decisive
difference
between

and
bond
all
bond
have
an
exact
value
on
the
exact
date
when
they
mature
and
this
enables
analyst
to
translate
each
bond
s
yield
curve
and
price
volatility
into
a
consistent
pattern
of
future
short
term
interest
rate
and
volatility
and
that
pattern
can
be
use
to
price
any

include
derivative
in
way
that
be
all
internally
consistent
this
insight
revolutionize
the

revolution

figure
out
private
client
service
ray
young
and
richard
menschel
saw
an
opportunity
in
the
early
seventy
to
develop
a
substantial
new
business
by
harness
two
establish
strength
of
goldman
sachs
if
execute
well
this
new
business
would
have
high
margin
require
little
or
no
capital
and
be
a
steady
long
term
moneymaker
good
execution
would
depend
on
an
entrepreneur
who
be
ambitious
unusually
presentable
and
tough
tough
enough
to
cold
call
persistently
in
many
different
city
over
many
year
except
for
one
crucial
distinction
the
business
opportunity
menschel
and
young
have
in
mind
be
the
basic
business
of
wall
street
retail
stockbrokerage
the
crucial
distinction
be
focus
focus
on
wealthy
individual
particularly
on
individual
who
have
become
wealthy
by
building
business
and
whose
wealth
have
suddenly
become
liquid
because
goldman
sachs
or
another
firm
have
help
sell
their
company
the
focus
would
give
goldman
sachs
an
important
unfair
competitive
advantage
since
the
firm
already
have
strong
research
and
trading
capability
in
place
to
serve
its
institutional
account
any
business
with
wealthy
individual
would
be
almost
entirely
incremental
so
the
profit
margin
would
be
high
as
volume
built
up
through
its
seller
rep
specialty
goldman
sachs
be
the
wall
street
leader
in
help
the
owner
of
small
and
medium
size
company
sell
out
on
favorable
term
after
a
sale
each
of
the
major
shareholder
suddenly
have
money
usually
lot
of
money
and
goldman
sachs
knew
exactly
who
they
be
and
how
much
they
each
now
have
to
invest
week
before
any
other
firm
in
addition
each
of
these
newly
wealthy
people
would
have
a
quite
favorable
predisposition
toward
the
firm
that
have
manage
the
sale
of
the
company
say
menschel
you
couldn
t
ask
for
a
well
opening
opportunity
for
a
security
salesman
if
goldman
sachs
manage
an
ipo
and
the
company
s
ceo
come
into
million
a
young
salesman
also
from
goldman
sachs
but
often
not
with
the
same
maturity
as
the
attend
investment
banker
would
call
about
manage
his
personal
investment
during
the
conglomerate
era
of
the
sixty
and
seventy
acquisition
be
at
an
all
time
high
for
example
u
s
industry
inc
alone
make
one
hundred
acquisition
in
half
as
many
month
create
at
least
one
or
two
and
often
as
many
as
a
dozen
freshly
mint
millionaire
in
each
of
one
hundred
sell
company
as
menschel
note
that
s
hundred
of
prospect
from
just
that
one
acquisition
active
company
and
there
be
big
deal
maker
like
jimmy
ling
the
murchisons
and
derald
ruttenberg
all
do
deal
and
create
big
liquid
personal
portfolio
once
a
few
successful
entrepreneur
in
a
city
have
become
client
and
experienced
the
firm
s
first
rate
service
and
solid
investment
result
they
would
be
more
than
happy
to
introduce
their
wealthy
friend
to
goldman
sachs
this
would
give
the
firm
an
expand
perimeter
of
competitive
advantage
in
building
its
individual
investor
business
some
of
these
new
customer
could
also
become
client
for
the
firm
s
seller
rep
business
a
perpetual
virtuous
cycle
menschel
thought
he
knew
the
right
man
for
the
job
of
building
a
significant
business
on
his
idea
menschel
have
be
assemble
the
firm
s
institutional
sale
force
one
person
at
a
time
with
great
care
and
high
standard
because
he
recognize
that
year
after
year
the
firm
with
the
best
relationship
with
institutional
investor
get
paid
significantly
more
than
the
second
or
third
rank
firm
serve
those
same
institution
the
key
factor
in
have
the
best
relationship
be

the
best
salesman
that
s
why
menschel
be
exact
in
recruiting
and
training

supervise
their
assignment
and
their
advancement
he
concentrate
recruiting
at

stanford
wharton
and
columbia
and
be
alert
to
unconventional
candidate
who
be
exception
that
prove
the
rule
like
roy
zuckerberg
whom
he
have
hire
a
few
year
before
look
over
zuckerberg
s
one

virtually
all
his
hire
be
at
business
school
particularly
harvard
business
school
partly
because
he
d
go

himself
partly
because
john
whitehead
and
john
weinberg
both
favor
hb
graduate
strongly
and
partly
because
the
training
there
make
his
salesman
highly
presentable
to
client
particularly
after
an
offhand
comment
like
your
salesman
will
be
sam
jones
he
go
to
harvard

out
with
the
help
of
goldman
sachs
or
any
other
firm
zuckerberg

would
call
on
every

single
way
they
have
much
more

it
s
just
as
easy
to

for
the
firm
add

they

they
be

always

important
in
the

fly
them
to

put
them
up
at

it
brought
everyone
together

generate
bonding
anyone
who

invite
to

recruit

carefully
and
work
with
them
closely
and
individually
to
train
them
to
be
effective
business
producer
we
train
and
train
so
everyone
knew
and
understood
every
product
and
how
to
use
it
and
we
built
pride
and
esprit
de
corp
so
we
have
very
low
turnover
which
meant
a
lot
to
the

we
have
great
client
loyalty
to
the

and
to
the
individual
in

and
that
really
help
us
build
a
very
solid
steady

on
a

rely
on

and
help
new
joiner
develop
their

and
their
book
of

be
also
expect
to
know
as
many
client
as
possible
particularly
the
more
active
and
important
client
in
their
region
only
significant
account
be
accepted
as
menschel
and
zuckerberg
say
over
and
over
the
only
real
difference
between
the
affluent
and
the
very
rich
be
the
size
of
their
order
in
the
seventy
an
account
have
to
have
one
million
dollar
in
the
market
then
it
be
five
million
dollar
then
ten
million
dollar
most
retail
stockbroker
try
to
cover
two
hundred
or
more
account
and
assume
they
ll
lose
and
replace
percent
of
them
a
year
so
they
go
for
major
commission
generate
turnover
in
the
account
while
they
have
them
but
at
pc
lose
an
account
be
like
an
earthquake
because
the
strategy
be
to
have
only
a
small
number
of
major
account
as
few
as
twenty
but
to
keep
all
of
them
forever
the
typical
brokerage
customer
who
stay
with
one
firm
will
go
through
six
different
representative
in
a
decade
at
pc
the
strategy
be
to
have
such
capable
salesperson
that
they
kept
client
so
long
that
they
really
get
to
know
their
hope
fear
worry
and
predilection

attend
their

listen

partly
about

partly
about
ask
good

to
learn

feeling
behind
the

give

the

they

it
be

the

after

to
clean
up

wash
the

that

different
we

and
understand
us
as

so
we
felt
comfortable
with
you
and
that
s
why
you
won
the

zuckerberg
recognize
early
that
the
key
to
success
in

be
be
effective
not
so
much
in
invest
asset
as
in
gathering

the
secret
be
that
there
be
no

he

show
people
that
you
really
care
be
sensitive
to

their
tolerance
for

the
client
we
want
be
all
smart

too
smart
for
any
baloney
and
they
get
lot
of
call
from
all
the
other

so
they
have
lot
of
choice
they
know
they
ll
get
pretty
smart
people
at
any
firm
so
they
look
for
something
meaningfully
special

that
special
something
be
understand
what
they
really
want
and
that
we
care

i
make
it

that
i
would
go
at
any
time
to
any
city
for
a
luncheon
or
a

with

a
guest

such
as

cooperman
our
investment
strategist

a
top

that

we
really
want

exasperate
zuckerberg
explain
that
if
a

use

to
double
the
number

pc
would
get
double
the

would
also
earn
extra

later
the

wealthy

understandably
tend
to
be
defensive

about
their
personal
wealth
they
know
they
cannot

forever
and
this
reality

they
have
gotten

year
later

this
typically
cut

well
above
the

to
attract
major

while
most

unhappy
even
bitter
with

substantial

with
both
zuckerberg
and
his
successor
bill
buckley
leave
the
partnership
it
be
almost
inevitable
that
the
whole
concept
of
pc
would
be
challenged
and
reinvent
mcnulty
and
murphy
lead
the
transformation
the
pc
business
model
be
flaw
say
mcnulty
at
the
end
of
the
year
you
have
to
start
all
over
again
we

paid
by
the
number
of
transaction
ticket
write
and
paid
very
well
for

ipo
but
that
be
not
an
investment
advisory
business
the
pc
salesperson
thought
they
be
asset
manager
but
they
be
actually
confuse
two
very
different
business
the
first
business
be
base
on
develop
personal
trust
and
personal
relationship
which
they
be
good
at
but
from
the
firm
s
perspective
pc
be
too
dependent
on
those
individual
the
second
business
be
the
investment
business
pc
be
a
series
of
personal
proprietorship
but
it
be
not
a
scalable
manageable
business
and
the
real
owner
of
the
business
be
the
individual
pc
people
not
the
firm
as
mcnulty
explain
the
pc
people
be
not
all
great
portfolio
architect
or
great
stock
picker
or
great
investment
strategist
and
the
world
of
invest
be
develop
skill
and
expectation
of
capability
and
professionalism
that
be
rapidly
outpace
them
mcnulty
and
murphy
convert
pc
from
the
entrepreneurial
business
model
developed
by
zuckerberg
and
menschel
into
a
corporate
design
in
which
pc
people
be
asset
gatherer
and
the
invest
be
increasingly
do
by
the
firm
through
gsam
and
firm
sponsor
fund
some
very
large
account
particularly
those
with
asset
over
one
hundred
million
dollar
and
poor
result
be
take
away
from
individual
salesman
and
make
firm
account
investment
management
be
shift
away
from
the
individual
pc
salesman
in
two
way
the
investment
product
be
broaden
to
include
more
asset
class
and
make
more
consistent
less
dependent
on
the
individual
pc
salesman
an
open
architecture
approach
to
product
source
brought
invest
capability
from
outside
gsam
after
he
retire
zuckerberg
go
to
the
firm
s
office
at
one
morning
in
and
be
surprised
to
see
what
be
now
call
the
private
wealth
management
area
almost
empty
where
be
everybody
where

all
the
people
someone
heard
him
knew
who
he
be
and
understood
what
he
meant
roy
it
s
different
now
and
so
it
be
now
everyone
be
part
of
a
large
organizational
effort
and
the
role
of
the
pc
people
be
concentrate
on
bring
in
the
account
and
service
them
other
people
chosen
because
they
be
professional
investment
manager
would
run
the
money
goldman
sachs
have
a
highly
profitable
scalable
business
pc
people
get
paid
well
and
the
profit
be
more
predictable
within
the
firm
some
miss
the
old
pc
hustle
but
most
believe
it
s
all
just
as
well
goldman

for
the

you
will
go

winkelman
dove
into
every
salient
aspect
of
the
operation
two
year
later
he
developed
the

he
thought
appropriately
bold
the
one
that

what
we
need
to

to

of
a

this

bob
rubin
have
a
very
soft
touch
with
word
and
as
a
manager
usually
make
his
quiet
suggestion
by
ask
question
recall
winkelman
his
approach
work
best
with
people
who
be
personally
modest
intellectually
open
and
comfortable
with
genuine
doubt
if
you
weren
t
this
kind
of
person
and
many
trader
weren
t
even
close
bob
would
simply
move
on
until
he
found
someone
he
could
really
work
with
rubin
set
the
right
tone
of
understatement
to
make
his
challenge
clear
and
compelling
to
winkelman
in
his
revise
business
plan
winkelman
take
j
aron
aggressively
into
currency
trading
with
the

at

with
this
change
the
unit
s
profit
in
its
third
year
as
part
of
goldman
sachs
be
actually
well
over
one
hundred
million
dollar
and
a
few
year
later
be
well
over
one
billion
no
less
than
one
third
of

sachs
s
total
profit
with
only
three
hundred
employee
in
a
firm
of
six
thousand
p
the
firm
s
eventual
success
in
commodity
be
certainly
not
create
by
the
acquisition
of
j
aron
success
be
achieve
only
through
massive
change
in
every
important
dimension
of
the
business
after
the
acquisition
most
of
the
people
and
all
the
business
leader
be
change
and
the
basic
risk
control
financial
arbitrage
business
model
be
change
into
a
capital
at
risk
proprietary
business
model
however
as
disappoint
and
painful
as
the
first
few
year
financial
result
be
the
acquisition
do
bring
to
goldman
sachs
a
cadre
of
trader
and
a
trading
culture
that
would
become
dominant
in
the
firm
and
the
man
who
would
become
its
ceo
still
the
path
from
here
to
there
would
have
to
be
figure
out
and
major
change
make
over
the
next
several
year
even
the
market
in
which
j
aron
operate
be
change
as
j
aron
move
boldly
into
foreign
exchange
and
oil
trading
these
change
require
reinvent
the
business
and
the
business
concept
profit
opportunity
in
the
gold
trading
business
be
basically
a
function
of
bullion
s
price
volatility
and
financial
market
arbitrage
so
j
aron
have
need
little
capital
and
enjoy
a
high
rate
of
return
on
the
capital
it
do
invest
as
a
matter
of
policy
j
aron
seldom
go
long
or
short
on
gold
bullion
or
try
to
profit
on
an
inventory
position
profit
be
make
principally
by
arbitrage
the
change
spread
between
the
london

market
and
the
new

growth
in
these

come
from

market
volatility
and
trading
volume
in
a
typical
day
as
an
independent

j
aron
have
do
one
thousand
trade
in
the
morning
and
three
thousand
trade
in
the
afternoon
carefully
match
its
long
and

position
within
second
to
be
sure
the
firm
be
never
much
expose
to

risk
our
plan
of
operation
call
for
be
long
or
short
up
to
a
maximum
of
twenty
second
explain
jack
aron
if
ever
there
be
any
serious
doubt
once
or
twice
a
year
the
whole
firm
would
stop
do
any
business
with
a
command
like
okay
everybody
shut
off
the
phone
immediately
we
re
do
a
one
hundred
percent
book
to
card
check
to
be
sure
we
have
absolutely
no
net
position
the
complete
analysis
could
take
until
nine
or
ten
at
night
j
aron
begin
as
a
coffee
trader
in
new
orleans
in
with
ten
thousand
dollar
in
capital
prosper
and
move
to
new
york
in
jack
aron
and
gu
levy
be
distant
relative
who
become
friend
in
their
early
day
in
both
new
orleans
and
new
york
city
and
both
be
leader
at
mount
sinai
hospital
and
in
the
jewish
community
their
two
firm
do
occasional
business
together
so
levy
have
be
interested
when
aron
call
on
him
in
the
late
sixty
to
say
gu
i
m
get
old
my
two
son
have
no
real
interest
in
the
business
our
two
firm
be
both
private
so
if
you
d
like
to
buy
i
d
like
to
sell
after
some
discussion
a
large
tax
liability
on
an
unrealized
gain
at
j
aron
get
in
the
way
and
levy
s
interest
in
a
deal
quickly
fade
later
when
jack
aron
take
another
tentative
goldman
sachs
offer
to
his

the
deal
be

and
never
sentimental
famously
say
honesty
be
one
of
the
best
policy
and
leave
it
to
his
listener

guess
which
policy
he
might

be
equally
good
coyne

his
seventy
and
have
move
away
from
the
business
to
concentrate
on
his
charitable
foundation
so
it
be
not
hard
for
the
two
men
to
agree
on
an
internal
management
buyout
and
arrange
the

he

he
didn

believe
it

we

first
as
an
ever
curious

who

out
coyne
learn
that
the

take
together
all
this
great

what

one
fascinate
characteristic
it
earn
zero

it
just
sat
in

coyne
knew
that

always
figure

and
that
the

always
reflect

so
he
call
on
the

j

strong

with

be
the
key
to
this

because
the

how
very
profitable
the

be
and
he
succeed
in
sell
j
aron
to
goldman
sachs
at
the
absolute
peak
of
its
earnings
strong
opposition
to
make
the
acquisition
come
from
goldman
sachs
partner
that
s
not
our
business
commodity
aren
t
security
if
they
want
to
sell
why
should
we
be
their
buyer
we
ll
just
be
patsy
but
as
debate
within
the
partnership
kept
postpone
the
decision
and
risk
j
aron
s
do
a

with
some
other
organization
the
recognition
of
the
moderate
risk
of
loss
if
thing
go
wrong
become
increasingly
persuasive
with
the
agree
purchase
price
of
million
offset
by
book
value
of
one
hundred
million
dollar
almost
all
in
cash
and
cash
equivalent
serious
risk
seem
small
since
risky
trading
position
be
minimize
because
trader
simultaneously
match
buy
and
sell
interest
explains
whitehead
the
operation
be
virtually
risk
free
whitehead
s
strategic
interest
in
internationalize
goldman
sachs
kept
his
focus
on
a
macro
vision
and
away
from
the
rigorous
operational
analysis
for
which
he
be
well
know
gold
trading
involves
every
country
in
the
world
so
it
s
the
most
international
of
business
and
at
goldman
sachs
we
be
expand
internationally
whitehead
be
determine
to
acquire
j
aron
as
one
part
of
internationalize
the
firm
and
as
a
signature
transaction
that
would
permanently
change
goldman
sachs
we
have
a
terrible
time
get
the
acquisition
approve
by
our
own
people
recall
whitehead
so
i
assign
steve
friedman
and
ken
brody
to
study
the
merit
of
the
acquisition
believe
that
since
steve
work
for
me
and
be
ambitious
to
advance
his
report
would
make
a
solid
positive
case
for
make
the
acquisition
but
he
surprised
me
by
recommend
against
acquire
j
aron
but
it
really
didn
t
matter
what
others
say
or
thought
because
doty
and
whitehead
be
determine
and
they
drove
it
through
the
all
powerful
management
committee
in
october
i
be
never
in
favor
of
buying
a
business
say
friedman
from
my
m
a
experience
i
knew
that
merger
be
always
hard
and
often
don
t
work
out
it
s
not
that
they
actually
fail
financially
but
they
underperform
and
disappoint
relative
to
expectation
because
the
organizational
culture
don
t
fit
together
conflict
and
tension
be
so
easy
to
have
and
culture
be
so
very
hard
to
integrate
and
goldman
sachs
have
a
very
strong
very
different
culture
we
would
always
be
well
off
building
our
own
because
the
key
to
success
be
always
people
and
we
have
the
best
people
lot
of
best
people
r
ironically
give
friedman
s
observation
after
the
acquisition
only
one
person
mark
winkelman
be
transfer
from
goldman
sachs
into
j
aron
while
several
j
aron
people
would
become
leader
in
goldman
sachs
and
one
lloyd
blankfein
would
eventually
become
the
firm
s
ceo
a
few
week
after
the
acquisition
while
goldman
sachs
be
strive
to
make
the
j
aron
people
feel
part
of
the
family
j
aron
s
cfo
charles
griffith
go
to
see
doty
to
say
george
i
m
go
to
resign
unless
i
can
become
a
partner
doty
and
whitehead
quickly
agree
that
he
would
have
to
be
make
a
partner
that
certainly
do
not
go
down
easily
with
all
those
who
have
be
compete
for
year
to
earn
a
goldman
sachs
partnership
particularly
after
see
six
other
j
aron
people
make
partner
as
part
of
the
deal
one
of
the
cardinal
firm
rule
be
that
nobody
should
ever
threaten
to
leave
if
not
take
into
the
partnership
partner
be
make
only
by
the
firm
and
only
when
the
firm
be
ready
these
postmerger
problem
be
disturb
but
certainly
not
as
disconcert
as
the
core
problem
with
the
j
aron
business
even
though
the
deal
be
do
as
more
and
more
difficulty
developed
opponent
within
goldman
sachs
be
convince
that
the
acquisition
of
j
aron
be
base
on
a
collection
of
mistake
in
both
strategy
and
tactic
some
of
the
erupt
difficulty
be
due
to
error
even
serious
error
but
some
be
due
to
unexpected
external
problem
most
partner
didn
t
bother
to
sort
out
the
two
kind
of
trouble
the
whole
experience
be
too
painful
as
one
partner
lament
we
make
every
mistake
in
this
merger
that
we
always
worried
client
would
make
in
their
merger
one
mistake
be
to
react
to
a
competitor
s
move
and
impute
a
threaten
reason
for
that
move
although
some
have
see
salomon
brother
s
link
with
phibro
as
a
strategic
master
stroke
in
fact
that
merger
have
not
be
driven
by
any
grand
strategy
it
be
really
just
a
great
trade
a
chance
for
the
partner
of
salomon
brother
a
private
firm
to
sell
out
and
get
percent
liquid
at
a
high
price
another
mistake
be
for
innocent
observer
to
develop
an
almost
romantic
vision
of
another
firm
s
have
both
low
business
risk
and
unlimited
opportunity
while
see
commodity
as
a
hedge
against
the
adversity
inflation
might
impose
on
the
security
business
another
be
to
assume
that
gu
levy
s
interest
in
the
j
aron
deal
have
be
strategic
when
it
be
really
closer
to
opportunistic
another
be
not
know
how
and
where
the
profit
be
really
be
make
and
not
realize
how
serious
the
misunderstanding
base
on
this
innocence
could
be
the
two
firm
culture
style
and
value
be
not
only
different
they
would
be
in
open
conflict
and
would
make
integration
difficult
mistake
would
include
lose
key
executive
early
on
not
have
a
clear
strategy
for
increase
profit
after
the
deal
be
do
pay
up
front
rather
than
obligate
the
seller
to
an
earn
out
and
tie
up
precious
capital
and
management
time
the
classic
mistake
be
not
understand
the
true
motivation
of
the
seller
and
not
remember
that
most
acquisition
be
not
purchase
driven
by
the
interest
of
the
buyer
but
be
sale
driven
by
seller
motivation
that
the
buyer
learn
about
only
long
after
the
deal
be
do
misreading
be
also
important
at
j
aron
where
coyne
have
somehow
expect
to
become
the
leader
of
the
combine
j
aron
goldman
sachs
organization
and
to
have
his
partner
in
major
leadership
role
goldman
sachs
do
not
really
understand
the
j
aron
business
but
the
seller
certainly
do
as
one
j
aron
partner
later
observe
it
would
have
be
a
very
difficult
time
if
we
have
not
sell
the
business
in
less
than
a
year
j
aron
s
record
profit
be
cut
in
half
and
a
year
later
there
be
loss
with
ten
of
million
of
dollar
of
goldman
sachs
partner
capital
lock
up
in
this
one
acquisition
the
add
opportunity
cost
of
not
use
that
money

we
ll
take
care
of
this
situation
they
met
every
week
with

not
to
discus
trading
but
to
explore
possible
business
strategy
and
management
decision
at
first
i
thought
it
would
be
difficult
a
real
punishment
recall
winkelman
but
soon
i
realize
that
it
be
a
golden
opportunity
first
i
saw
what
a
great
strategic
vision
john
whitehead
have
and
how
important
that
be
second
we
get
a
lot
of
exposure
to
the
firm

real
leader
they
get
personally
involve
to
be
sure
we
would
eventually
solve
the
many
problem
at
j
aron
and
there
be
lot
of
problem
with
low
volume
and
narrow
spread
the
real
question
be
whether
a
commodity
business
need
the
big
overhead
of
a
large
organization
or
whether
it
could
operate
with
a
small
group
of
skillful
trader
during
that
difficult
period
the
naysayer
within
the
firm
be
have
a
field
day
not
only
they
told
management
have
you
apparently
just
to
keep
up
with
the
jones
at
salomon
phibro
bought
a
business
we
don
t
understand
and
really
don
t
need
and
lose
a
pile
of
money
and
tie
up
a
lot
of
capital
you
now
want
to
send
good
money
after
bad
to
build
up
a
trading
business
by
make
market
almost
none
of
us
know
anything
about
with
customer
we
know
very
little
about
and
care
less
about
it

the
wrong
business
at
the
wrong
price
do
for
the
wrong
reason
at
the
wrong
time
and
now
you
want
to
build
up
an
even
large
risk
exposure
and
capital
commitment
to
do
a
bad
business
with
the
wrong
account
whitehead
and
weinberg
understood
what
have
to
be
do
a
complete
redesign
of
every
aspect
of
the
old
business
model
in
foreign
exchange
j
aron
s
business
model
be
modest
and
deliberately
cautious
this
be
all
wrong
for
the
market
as
it
be
develop
and
we
realize
we
have
to
start
over
recall
winkelman
who
begin
ask
himself
a
series
of
fundamental
question
include
the
one
that
lead
to
a
breakthrough
what
if
we
risk
our
capital
and
work
as
dealer
rubin
and
winkelman
agree
on
that
strategic
imperative
the
firm
would
have
to
commit
substantial
capital
to
the
business
and
switch
to
boldly
embrace
risk
in
a
capital
intensive
risk
take
principal
business
on
a
global
scale
to
make
serious
money
the
firm
would
have
to
take
serious
risk
trading
commodity
for
its
own
account
when
acquire
j
aron
be
described
as
a
lead

and
commodity
trading
firm
by
the
time
less
than
a
decade
later
that
j
aron
be
contribute
one
third
of
goldman
sachs
s
profit
it
be
make
most
of
its
money
not
in
gold
and
general
commodity
but
in
foreign
exchange
and
oil
trading
after
twenty
year
admittedly
twenty
long
year
coffee
trading
also
work
out
well
after
coyne
left
at
the
end
of
blankfein
be
suddenly
without
a
specific
job
but
he
be
quite
promising
and
wasn
t
paid
all
that
much
recall
winkelman
so
we
move
him
into
sale
in
metal
to
see
if
he
might
work
out
he
be
clearly
bright
and
energetic
even
dynamic
and
passionate
blankfein
demonstrate
good
sale
talent
in
metal
so
winkelman
give
him
more
responsibility
in
by
put
him
in
charge
of
the
six
salesman
in

against
that
move
mark
caution
bob

that
s
probably
not
the
right
thing
to
do
we
ve
never
see
it
work
to
put
salesperson
in
charge
of

in
other
area
of
the

be
you
pretty
sure
of
your
analysis
really
appreciate
your
experience
bob
but
i
think
he
ll
do
all
right
lloyd
s
driven
and
he
be
a
very
smart
guy
with
a
very
inquire
mind
so
i
have
some
confidence
what
winkelman
didn
t
know
be
that
blankfein
be
an
occasional
visitor
to
gamble
casino
fascinate
by
the
discipline
of
poker
and
very
use
to
win
blankfein
be
determine
to
learn
all
he
could
and
surround
himself
with
trader
and
economist
as
winkelman
have
advise
him
he
practice
by
take
small
trading
position
to
develop
his
skill
in
timing
and
his
feel
for
the
market
while
work
to
learn
learn
and
learn
fortunately
the
global
commodity
business
be
grow
rapidly
in
volume
and
strategic
change
be
always
easy
to
make
in
a
growth
situation
recall
winkelman
not
only
the
scale
but
also
the
very
nature
of
the
commodity
business
be
change
as
derivative
kept
displace
physicals
and
thousand
of
new
participant
come
into
the
market
we
should
do
oil
announce
bob
rubin
one
morning
in
the
eighty
have
notice
phibro
s
volume
in
crude
oil
and
oil
future
the
same
sort
of
change
be
come
to
oil
trading
that
have
come
to
foreign

in
the
seventy
as

rate
contract
be
displace
by
market
in

and
future
phibro
be
big
in
oil
so
let
s
look
there
for
good
people
but
after
look
over
a
few
phibro
oil
trader
and
decide
they
d
never
fit
into
goldman
sachs
rubin
decide
to
focus
recruiting
on
trader
work
at
major
nonfinancial
company
and
hire
john
drury
head

at
cargill
s
european
subsidiary
while
he
couldn
t

and
be
soon
ease
out

before
he
left

set
up
an
effective
organization

some
good

and
brought

from
the
decline

business
oil
be
not
completely
fungible
like
wheat
or
gold
so
it
can
t
be
swap
or
exchange
in
the
same
way
oil
trading
be
operationally
intensive
because
each
forward

a

in

long
chain
of
transaction
involve
one
specific

each

be
unique
and
have
to
be
clear
step
by
step
through
that
same
entire
chain
we
go
into
oil
trading
in
with
all
the
market
make
and
operational
difficulty
you
might
imagine
recall
winkelman
but
we
do
well
that
year
instead
of
another
loss
of
six
million
dollar
we
make
a
profit
of
eighteen
million
i
be
feel
pretty
proud
and
confident
in
the
future
of

and
felt
good
about
the
approach
we
be
take
but
i
be
only
a
second

so
in
prepare
for
the
annual
planning
meeting
of
the
partner
in
december
i
turn
to
bob
rubin
for
help
and
he
laid
out
his
vision
for
the
business
and
his
expectation
for
the
come
year
or
two
currency
option
trading
be
just
get
start
on
the
international
monetary
market
with
his
early
understand
of
the
equity
option
market
rubin
press
for
more
and
more
commitment
to
develop
new
currency
option
instrument
and
make
market
in
them
he
understood
that
while
early
stage
volume
would
be
light
margin
would
be
wide
and
that
the
best
time
to
establish
goldman
sachs
as
a
major
market
maker
be
early
at
the
creation
of
the
market
currency
option
trading
be
still
too
small
for
the
big
commercial
bank
and
they
have
not
participate
in
equity
option
and
have
no
related
business
experience
so
they
stayed
away
while
winkelman
s
j
aron
make
ten
million
dollar
in
this
niche
business
in
and
twenty
million
dollar
in
winkelman
wasn
t
satisfied
while
it
be
fine
to
make
six
million
dollar
trading
on
the
plaza
accord
an
agreement
by
the
g
industrial
nation
to
stop
the
dollar
s
increase
in
value
against
the
yen
and
the
german
mark
he
recognize
that
the
firm
could
have
make
and
he
thought
should
have
make
sixty
million
dollar
the
metal
trading
business
model
be
also
change
substantially
but
it
didn
t
really
matter
because
overall
market
volume
be
way
down
and
as
winkelman
say
it
s
hard
to
make
large
profit
in
a
die
business
after
replace
eighty
percent
to
ninety
percent
of
management
j
aron
be
in
a
very
different
business
than
the
one
we
acquire
say
a
continue
skeptic
the
partner
of
goldman
sachs
would
not
say
the
acquisition
itself
be
a
good
deal
whitehead
take
a
different
view
we
never
would
have
venture
into
any
of
those
highly
profitable
business
without
the
j
aron
acquisition
and
the
worldwide
nature
of
the
commodity
business
contribute
importantly
to
the
firm
s
go
global
others
go
far
and
say
it
be
the
best
acquisition
the
firm
ever
make
partly
because
of
the
profit
partly
because
of
the
people
who
become
firm
leader
and
partly
for
the
firmwide
commitment
to
proprietary
trading
and
to
an
entrepreneurial
trading
style
that
blossom
under
winkelman
rubin
and
blankfein
as
pension
fund

their
investment
in
international

sock
at
a
nearby
brook
brother
we
couldn
t
protect
esb
s
independence
say
friedman
but
we
could
and
do
get
them
a
much
high
price
and
a
friendly
merger
with
a
white
knight
the
combination
of
many
component
into
a

as
the
part
be
actually
come
together
the

may
look
like
just
good
luck

because
of
its
long
stand

against

goldman
sachs
have
be
building
its
skill
experience
and
reputation
for
integrity
as
the
one
wall
street
firm
that
be
always
on
management
s
side
goldman
sachs
s
policy
on
no
hostile
be
base
on
the
simple
proposition
that
in
most
case
they
just
don
t
work
explains
whitehead
the
very
act
of
a
hostile
takeover
will
alienate
the
management
of
the
acquire
company
many
will
be
embitter
and
will
quit
those
that
stay
on
will
have
go
through
an
unhappy
adversarial
confrontation
in
public
with
real
damage
do
it
usually
begin
with
a
meeting
that
come
as
an
unwelcome
surprise
the
target
company
s
share
be
almost
always
in
a
slump
usually
sell
for
less
than
book
value
the
intend
acquirer
open
the
initial
meeting
with
a
general
observation
that
a
combination
of
the
two
company
would
surely
be
quite
favorable
for
everyone
and
then
proceeds
to
propose
several
specific
action
to
realize
the
fine
opportunity
for
synergy
and
to
increase
profit
but
of
course
none
of
these
action
or
idea
appeal
to
the
target
company
s
management
so
they
decline
the
invitation
to
merge
and
the
meeting
break
up
but
not
for
long
as
whitehead
recount
it
the
very
next
day
in
an
obviously
previously
well
plan
attack
that
be
in
clear
contrast
to
the
assertion
of
friendly
cooperation
make
the
day
before
large
advertisement
appear
in
all
the
newspaper
delineate
the
gross
incompetence
strategic
blunder
and
persistent
error
of
the
present
management
and
offering
to
rescue
shareholder
with
a
bid
some
percent
over
the
current
market
price
various
judgmental
comment
be
make
in
private
and
in
public
about
the
obvious
inadequacy
of
incumbent
management
then
the
target
s
management
responds
in
similar
tone
or
bad
and
the
fight
be
on
and
it
get
bad
and
bad
as
time
go
on
if
the
target
company
resists
the
acquisitor
will
step
up
the
pressure
usually
disparage
the
current
management
and
its
past
record
sometimes
quite
forcefully
and
publicly
vitriol
come
easily
thing
be
say
under
pressure
some
quite
bitter
and
hurtful
that
be
very
hard
to
forget
later
on
after
all
that
what
be
the
real
chance
of
the
two
management
work
well
together
not
very
great
whitehead
say
so
most
hostile
takeover
do
eventually
fail
the
act
of
take
over
often
do
real
damage
so
we
decide
against
be
involve
in
hostile
takeover
partly
as
a
matter
of
business
ethic
but
primarily
as
a
matter
of
business
judgment
and
over
the
year
we
earn
a
reputation
as
a
firm
that
could
truly
be
trust
and
couldn
t
be
bought
and
be
perhaps
more
focus
on
ethic
and
judgment
so
company
increasingly
often
come
to
us
on
their
own
initiative
seek
our
advice
and
assistance
and
quite
a
few
chose
to
retain
goldman
sachs
to
advise
them
on
the
way
they
could
prevent
or
at
least
greatly
impede
a
hostile
attempt
at
takeover
overall
it
do
work
out
very
well
goldman
sachs
prosper
commercially
and
our
reputation
grow
as
a
good
firm
to
do
business
with
the
firm
get
paid
its
full
retainer
each
year
whether
or
not
the
client
get
raid
for
a
giant
corporation
while
a
hostile
takeover
be
clearly
unlikely
the
annual
fee
seem
so
small
and
the
subject
so
new
and
important
that
signing
on
be
an
easy
why
not
matter
as
fred
weintz
recall
this
business
fit
in
with
our
image
as
a
firm
and
our
desire
to
be
see
always
on
the
same
side
of
the
table
as
our
client
and
it
fit
with
the
firm
s
long
history
of
seller
representation
help
owner
whose
company
be
ready
for
sale
decide
whether
to
have
a
public
offering
or
merge
into
a
large
company
friedman
summarizes
and
it
work
well
as
a
business
but
not
at
the
begin
even
the
name
wasn
t
clear
friedman
favor
and
still
do
the
more
explicit
and
graphic
term
raid
defense
and
others
prefer
takeover
defense
but
whitehead
ever
the
statesman
in
public
decide
on
use
the
softer
more
mellow
euphemism
tender
defense
at
first
friedman
argue
that
the
firm
could
work
on
both
side
but
whitehead
say
no
some
be
cautious
at
first
because
the
mechanic
could
get
pretty
complex
pretty
fast
and
nobody
in
ibs
want
to
be
embarrass
by
not
fully
understand
the
complexity
but
ibs
guy
love
to
sell
it
the
fee
be
low
and
know
up
front
every
prospective
client
welcome
the
offer
many
be
scar
that
they
might
be
next
the
firm
s
no
hostile
policy
fit
perfectly
with
its
increase
emphasis
on
exclusive
seller
representation
a
business
whitehead
have
innovate
and
advocate
as
far
superior
to
conventional
business
brokerage
both
in
business
decorum
and
even
well
in
profit
to
the
firm
because
it
be
not
competitive
and
be
fee
base
and
because
success
could
earn
significant
incentive
fee
seller
rep
be
particularly
well
suit
to
goldman
sachs
s
extensive
relationship
create
by
its
increasingly
effective
ibs
business
developer
with
small
and
midsize
company
often
privately
own
or
dominate
by
an
owner
manager
when
leadership
succession
or
business
strategy
problem
be
serious
difficulty
it
be
not
unusual
for
an
owner
to
solve
his
business
problem
by
sell
goldman
sachs
conscientiously
developed
a
premier
reputation
for
get
a
high
than
expect
price
which
the
ibs
organization
would
be
sure
to
recount
to
its
many
future
prospect
so
goldman
sachs
be
unusually
well
position
to
take
advantage
of
opportunity
when
it
come
as
a
result
of
change
in
federal
antitrust
policy
for

the
business

a
in
the
patois
of
the
financial
market
for
a
large
fee
have
begin
to
bloom
at
a
very
specific
time
the
day
in
when
a
stanford
law
school
professor
william
baxter
told
ronald
reagan
s
recruiter
i
ll
take
the
job
as
assistant
attorney
general
but
only
if
i
can
change
the
basic
frame
of
antitrust
policy
his
proposition
be
accepted
and
six
month
later
he
put
out
entirely
new
policy
guideline
on
how
market
and
market
dominance
should
be
define
guideline
that
be
much
more
tolerant
of
merger
then
in
industry
after
industry
one
company
try
make
an
acquisition
and
then
when
the
antitrust
division
do
not
complain
or
intervene
another
company
would
make
an
acquisition
and
soon
it
seem
that
everyone
get
into
acquire

merge
this
lead
to
giant
fee
for

then
to

take
the

propose

to
expansionist
company
in
one
industry
after
another
serve
too
few
of
the
nation
s
large
corporation
have
for
year
be
a
major
frustration
for
sidney
weinberg
whose
strategic
objective
have
always
be
to
build
goldman
sachs
into
a
lead
investment
bank
which
ipso
facto
meant
serve
the
large
and
lead
corporation
but
morgan
stanley
first
boston
dillon
read
and
lehman
brother
be
almost
unassailable
in
their
position
as
investment
banker
to
most
of
the
major
blue
chip
corporation
so
goldman
sachs
would
have
to
build
most
of
its
business
with
medium
size
and
small
company
and
these
company
be
a
lot
more
likely
to
be
takeover
target
but
now
with
tender
defense
what
have
be
a
problem
suddenly
become
an
opportunity
since
goldman
sachs
s
client
be
much
more
likely
to
be
target
need
help
with
their
defense
the
firm
be
much
less
likely
than
others
to
face
conflict
of
interest
when
offering
advice
on
defense
because
most
of
its
client
be
too
small
to
be
the
attack
raider
goldman
sachs
could
make
a
virtue
out
of
its
competitive
weakness
and
decide
to
make
a
major
push
in
tender
defense
friedman
say
we
have
a
bloodlust
to
go
up
in
front
of
board
of
director
the
pathway
lead
to
bob
hurst
s
call
me
as
soon
as
possible
message
begin
a
few
month
before
with
a
surprise
the
ronson
lighter
company
a
well
establish
goldman
sachs
client
suddenly
become
the
target
of
an
unwanted
takeover
bid
by
a
european
conglomerate
this
be
a
new
kind
of
experience
new
to
ronson
new
to
america
and
new
to
goldman
sachs
scramble
to
find
a
possible
white
knight
that
might
outbid
the
european
predator
one
of
the
company
the
firm
decide
to
call
on
be
electric
storage
battery
as
hurst
recall
my
first
call
for
goldman
sachs
be
on
electric
storage
battery
one
of
my
old
merrill
lynch
client
a
sleepy
midsize
company
with
several
fine
product
include
ray
o
vac
and
duracell
battery
and
a
stock
price
sell
below
net
current
asset
my
main
purpose
in
call
on
esb
be
to
see
if
they
might
be
interested
in
buying
ronson
but
during
that
visit
i
warn
ceo
fred
port
that
his
own
company
be
vulnerable
to
a
potential
takeover
because
the
share
price
be
so
very
low
three
month
later
on
a
thursday
international
nickel
one
of
canada
s
most
respect
company
with
a
fine
credit
rating
make
a
takeover
bid
for
esb
through
morgan
stanley
this
be
america
s
first
hostile
takeover
bid
advise
by
a
major
blue
blood
investment
banking
firm
and
come
as
it
do
from
morgan
stanley
then
the
prestige
firm
in
the
business
it
threw
out
the
old
rule
book
which
have
say
that
respectable
investment
banker
simply
do
not
conduct
hostile
raid
on
other
company
if
morgan
stanley
could
and
would
do
a
raid
all
the
old
assumption
against
raid
be
over
and
the
glove
be
off
from
then
on
any
investment
banker
could
advise
any
corporate
client
on
anything
and
with
perfect
impunity
everybody
could
do
a
raid
in
the
mid
seventy
by
law
a
cash
tender
offer
have
to
be
accepted
or
reject
by
the
target
company
s
board
of
director
in
no
more
than
eight
day
this
make
time
urgency
a
major
factor
for
both
the
raider
and
the
target
company
the
law
would
be
change
but
in
time
pressure
be
very
real
particularly
for
the
unprepared
which
be
why
cash
tender
be
call
saturday
night
special
esb
be
totally

two
of
the
best
talent
in
the
business
we
didn
t
know
what
to
do
invent
and
improvise
we
make
it
up
as
we
go
along
but
we
be
commit
smart
and
determine
fortunately
for
us
and
for
esb
as
unprepared
as
we
be
nobody
else
really
knew
what
to
do
either
so
there
be
no
rule
of
the
road
inco
s
initial
offer
be
twenty
seven
dollar
a

prevail
but
paid
forty
one
dollar
more
than
percent
above
its
initial
generous
offer
as
friedman
say
we
may
have
lose
although
ironically
that
acquisition
later
turn
out
to
be
a
real
turkey
for
inco
but
our
client
won
a
major
improvement
in
price
and
we
get
great
press
coverage
for
all
the
good
work
we
d
do
plus
a
nice
fee
and
smart
people
in
the
marketplace
get
the
crucial
message
goldman

be
all
sense
that
a
pattern
be
start
to

and
just
possibly
a

line
of

explain
the
situation

we

get
one
hell
of
a
problem
and
ask
the
obvious
question
what
ll
we
do
lot
come
the
immediate
and
confident
reply
year
later
gorter
reflect
he
be
quick
to
see
goldman
sachs
in
the
role
of
his
defender
and
we
be
ready
to
help
it
be
perfect
friedman
flew
to
chicago
s
o
hare
airport
and
drove
to
gorter
s
home
on
the
north
shore
the
two
men
sat
by
the
pool
to
talk
out
what
the
real
business
opportunity
might
be
and
how
goldman
sachs
could
take
full
advantage
of
it
could
the
firm
develop
a
significant
profitable
business
how
could
it
best
be
do
strategically
we
soon
realize
that
we
be
see
what
could
be
the
first
robin
of
a
major
transformational
change
recall
friedman
the
game
and
all
its
rule
be
change
maybe
forever
we
could
tell
that
there
would
be
more
hostile
takeover
bid
maybe
lot
more
so
we
knew
we
should
get
involve
in
a
major
way
the
two
men
begin
sketch
out
a
business
proposition
ask
themselves
if
a
company
have
no
tie
to
wall
street
and
management
get
the
call
from
a
raider
some
friday
night
whom
be
they
go
to
call
if
they
call
their
banker
or
lawyer
and
ask
for
a
recommendation
whom
will
they
suggest
gorter
and
friedman
answer
their
own
question
if
we
re
see
to
be
on
the
side
of
the
angel
we
ll
get
all
those
call
as
whitehead
later
say
lawyer
for
a
threaten
company
would
certainly
be
encourage
to
say
why
not
retain
goldman
sachs
just
for
this
one
special
service
they
can
be
trust
so
we
get
lot
of
mandate
often
from
company
we
didn
t
know
particularly
well
and
tender
defense
fit
in
with
the
firm
s
overall
position
of
no
conflict
with
management
and
the
reality
of
goldman
sachs
s
client
typically
be
small
company
and
therefore
acquisition
target
tender
defense
work
out
quite
well
as
a
business
for
goldman
sachs
and
our
reputation
grow
as
a
firm
that
could
truly
be
trust
and
as
a
good
firm
with
which
to
do
business
late
one
night
friedman

morning
and
we
be

geoff
boisi
recall
the
way
the
firm
continued
take
the

from

on
he
say
at
ten
p
m
we
d
jump
in
a
cab
and
drive
up
broadway
to
nathan
s
famous
not
for
hot
dog
but
for
the
next
day

would
quickly
look

we

metal
in
houston
a
company
goldman
sachs
have
never
before
call
on
to
tell
him
we
would
be
in
his
office
the
very
next
morning
to

he
be
stun
he
hadn
t
heard
a
peep
about

danger
our

be
the
first
he
heard
that
he
be
in
a
crisis
he
didn
t
know
any
of
us
but
he
sure
treat
us
like
long
lose
friend
when
we
arrive
in
houston
that
next
morning
in
a
raid
defense
situation
like
this
we
d
take

new
client
in
interest
rate
be
at

say
friedman
they
didn

from

from

of
the

until
we
launch

in

and
it
take

recall

still
we
get
a
lot
of
resistance
from
inside
the

the

have
have
to

of

themselves
just
a

year
before

how
can
you
expect
me
to
go
to
my
client
and
scare
him
to
death
about
be
take
over
and
lose

we
want
a
fee
structure
that
have
no
incentive
for
us
to
sell
the
company
so
we
work
out
a
way
to
win
in
any
of
three
outcome
first
we
d
win
if
we
beat
the
raider
off
second
we
could
win
by
get
the
raider
to
pay
a
high
price
and
we
would
win
if
the
target
company
get
sell
to
another
company
a
white
knight
sometimes
of
course
we
soft
pedal
tender

prefer
to
get
in
on
the

business
instead
goldman
sachs

arbitrageur
lead
by
bob
rubin
often
give
important
help
with
market
intelligence
on
the
risk
of
a
raid
s
develop
and
how
it
might
develop
an
important
part
of
goldman
sachs
s
arsenal
be
its
skill
and
bold
strategy
in
negotiate
the

particularly
the

of
final

friedman
be
particularly
effective
in

negotiation
always
work
to
maximize
the

s

particularly
when
the
client
be
be
too
cautious
the
management
of
chicago
s
lasalle
bank
have
decide
to
sell
and
have
agree
internally
on
their

the

at
which
they
would
sell
abn

get

enter
into

with

and
everything

the

come
in
with

thirty

a

management
be

than
pleased
and
about
to
say
yes
when
friedman
say
no
there
s
more
here
but
thirty
two
dollar
be
high
than
our

number
let
s
not
risk
lose
the

at
thirty
two

gorter
recall
the
situation
steve
be
as
cool
as
could
be
say
there
s
more
in
it
for
you
and
sure
enough
after
some
intense
negotiation
with
the
dutch
that
s
just
what
happen
steve
get
them
even
more
when
a
raid
begin
if
the

wasn

already
involve
it
would
decide
base
on
the

potential
for

whether

either
skadden

wachtell
lipton
this
of
course
do
not
go
unnoticed
by
those
two
major
law
firm
so
it
be
no
surprise
when
they
repeatedly
recommend
goldman

as
the

bank
to
use
for
this

the

goldman
sachs

offer
to
give
a

about

take

be
a

more
numerous

with

at
a

we
consider
both
twenty
five
thousand
and
fifty

doubt
we
could

so
we
go
with
forty

that
s
what
the

with

that
come
together
in
a
major
corporate
takeover
that
might
have
seem
like
bad
news
for
goldman

it
meant
the
firm
could
have
a
fairly
hard
time
explain
what
it
could
do
to
help
but
in
fact
it
be
great
news
because
goldman
sachs
would
have
every
opportunity
to
be
and
be
perceive
to
be
real

truly
a

threat
to

goldman

always
get
their
absolute
attention

that
any

their
own
weight
by
generate
adequate
earnings
be
at
real
and
very
visible
risk
because
a
raider
could
sell
off
those
very
asset
to
raise
money
and
pay
a
significant
part

several
aggressive
change

ceo
have
a
special
reason
for
invite
the

to
make
presentation
they
realize
they
could
use
the
threat
of
a
takeover
to
force
through
structural
change
whenever
senior
management
introduce
us
to
a
company
s
board
of
director
either
marty
lipton
or
joe
flom
would
present
along
with
us
recall
friedman
it
be
great
this
be
a
subject
on
which
we
be
suddenly
expert
and
it
be
a
matter
of
actual
life
or
death
for
the
company
so
we
be
in
an
ideal
situation
see
as
expert
on
a
crucial
matter
we
be
clearly
on
the
company

side
and
we
be
talk
to
all
the
right
people
in
each
company
this
automatically
put
us
in
the
ideal
pole
position
to
compete
for
any
future
investment

business
and
to
develop
a
strong

on

it
won
numerous
mandate
from
its
new
client
to
execute
specific
transaction
because
the
best
defense
be
often
preemptive
take
the
action
a
raider
might
take
after
gain
control
such
as
sell
off
unrelated
or
unnecessary
business
but
do
it
before
the
raider
make
his
first
bid
if
the
value
of
a
division
be
not
reflect
in
the
company
s
total
market
value
and
a
raider
would
probably
sell
it
to
raise
money
to
help
pay
for
the
takeover
why
wait
sell
that
division
now
the
operation

divest
be
usually
the
result
of
a
prior

sell
be
often
painless
of

for

there

turn
down

this

it

recall
with

goldman

its

with
regular

armellino

for

joe
elli
make
himself
the

like
our
annual
conference
on
international
retailing
where
i
give
a
slide
show
of

i

take

steven
einhorn
recall
comparative
advantage
differ
from
analyst
to
analyst
but
the
firm
also
want
enough
consistency
to
create
an
overall
brand
for
its
research
part
of
this
be
visual
so
that
goldman
sachs
research
would
stand
out
research
report
always
have
three
section
the
investment
conclusion
the
reason
and
any
risk
with
this
format
there
be
no
structural
surprise
and
the
serious
reader
knew
what
to
expect
the
firm
also
use
a
consistent
approach
to
valuation
and
identify
the
driver
in
each
sector
professional
editor
be
brought
in
to
increase
the
clarity
and
consistency
of
the
analyst
write
in
research
report
it
be
essential
to
find
the
balance
between
individualization
to
maximize
the
different
strength
of
different
individual
and
teamwork
so
we
would
collectively
develop
a
big
than
any
one
of
us
franchise
one
thing
be
a
certainty
we
didn
t
want
to
homogenize
creativity
and
entrepreneurial
drive
into
blah
the
stylistic
and
analytical
difference
between
analyst
coverage
of
their
different
industry
be
offset
by
a
strong
commitment
to
frame
capability
in
macroeconomics
and
portfolio
strategy
both
lee
cooperman
and
gary
wenglowski
become
partner
because
their
work
in
portfolio
strategy
and
economics
be
so
strong
and
so
well
accepted
by
institutional
investor
all
over
the
country
this
acceptance
do
not
come
easily
both
men
be
highly
visible
on
the
institutional
investor
circuit
new

they
be
on
the
road
almost
half
their
day
and
night
with
the
local
salesman
in
each
city
run
them
through
meeting
after
meeting
from
an
early
breakfast
right
through
dinner
and
then
a
late
flight
on
to
the
next
city
and
another
series
of
meeting
the
research
sale
organization
developed
by
richard
menschel
capitalize
effectively
on
the
rapidly
develop
research
product
and
establish
goldman
sachs
as
the
most
important
provider
of
research
service
to
the
most
institutional
investor
develop
a
strong
stream
of
revenue
and
earnings
and
the
relationship
network
for
success
in
underwriting
another
strength
behind
the
firm
s
rapid
buildup
in
research
be
economic
the
department
didn
t
have
to
rely
entirely
on
institutional
stockbrokerage
to
absorb
cost
investment
banking
help
in
a
major
way
we
be
the
first
firm
to
have
banking
pay
for
research
recall
cooperman
they
paid
fifty
percent
of
the
total
cost
because
the
relationship
manager
in
banking
be
all
generalist
and
they
knew
they
need
to
have
research
to
have
a
competitive
edge
when
make
their
call
on
company
an
obvious
question
be
how
the
firm
should
handle
conflict
when
an
analyst
be
negative
about
a
major
investment
banking
client
would
professional
integrity
or
he
who
pay
the
piper
call
the
tune
prevail
the
answer
to
that
question
be
clear
from
the
begin
goldman
sachs
have
always
be
first
class
on
integrity
in
research
say
joe
elli
if
you
ve
do
your
homework
and
form
a
judgment
you
ll
be
support
in
your
decision
for
example
sears
have
always
be
a
very
important
client
of
the
firm
back
in
after
write
a
positive
report
in
i
recognize
that
thing
be
become
terribly
wrong
in
the
way
sears
be
be
manage
and
the
way
it
be
head
and
i
become
quite
negative
on
the
stock
as
an
investment
while
we
didn
t
publish
a
formal
negative
report
everyone
knew
i
be
negative
and
they
knew
why
even
so
our
firm
s
management
be
very
supportive
an
analyst
s
career
begin
with
master
an
industry
its
major
company
and
financial
analysis
then
if
he
or
she
have
manage
to
develop
a
strong
franchise
with
institutional
investor
the
analyst
becomes
a
top
ranked
name
institutional
analyst
with
a
support
team
help
with
client
service
and
cover
more
company
in
the
industry
that
industry
expertise
be
then
link
to
investment
banking
work
on
deal
with
senior
corporate
management
give
the
industry
analyst
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
knowledge
of
the
industry
and
the
major
competitor
and
give
the
analyst
in
depth
exposure
to
the
operational
reality
of
the
firm
s
business
which
help
professional
growth
say
elli
my
advice
to
young
analyst
be
always
dedicate
yourself
to
be
number
one
in
your
research
specialty
and
if
you
re
not
number
one
examine
why
you
re
not
yet
and
what
you
must
do
to
get
there
the
analyst
s
job
be
hard
and
require
many
different
skill
as
elli
say
you
have
to
be
very
good
on
financial
analysis
and
on
interview
and
on
business
judgment
and
market
judgment
and
able
to
work
effectively
with
institutional
investor
and
the
sale
force
and
with
corporate
executive
and
investment
banker
it
s
complicate
and
it
s
very
hard
to
serve
all
of
them
really
well
elli
worry
that
the
firm
miss
an
opportunity
to
be
even
more
effective
by
develop
one
branding
for
goldman
sachs
rather
than
each
analyst
s
develop
his
or
her
own
brand
analyst
initiate
develop
and
maintain
relationship
with
institutional
analyst
and
portfolio
manager
through
visit
phone
call
e

and
formal
research
report
all
of
which

also

the
late

from
the
analyst
merchandising
an

expertise
as
well
as
specific

be
nearly
as
important

explanation

how
he
d
gotten
to

the

to
his

forty
five

orchestrate

in

like
every
successful

maker
weinberg
always
look
for
the
bond
in
common
and
often
found
it
on

dupont

very
british
ceo

seem
stiff

aloof
far
remove
from
john

s
gregarious
earthy
informality
but
weinberg
knew
that
jefferson
have
also
serve
in
combat
and
out
of
that
common
experience
he
quickly
developed
a
friendly
relationship
and
a
channel
of
communication
that
facilitate
a
major
transaction
between
distant
and
different
organization
as
weinberg
later
explain
back
in
when
the
bronfmans
bought
their
position
we
have
work
out
a

agreement
include
how
many
seat
the
seagram
group
have
on
the
dupont
board

on
each
of
the
key
committee
so
we
get
to
know
everybody
pretty
well
over
the

typically
weinberg
left
out
any
explanation
of
how
he
earn
the
respect

trust
of
both
party
in
a

in
what
be
then
the
large
takeover
in

over
his
many

weinberg
who

then
the
second
large
acquisition
in
american
history
one
part
of
weinberg
s
effectiveness
be
his
ability
to
stay
out
of
the
newspaper
and
to
work
effectively
within
the
goldman
sachs
organization
the
best
work
i
do
be
anonymous
he
observe
the
new

time
note
that
he
have
achieve
a
privacy
that
would
make
any
head
of
the
central
intelligence
agency
jealous
weinberg
never
take
himself
too
seriously
the
bos
need
to
lose
argument
not
all
argument
but
enough
to
keep
everybody
honest
and
responsible
for
clear
think
you
can
t
micromanage
this
business
from
headquarters
about
innovative
idea
of
which
there
be
a
great
many
he
tend
to
be
conservative
but
if
the
young
buck
be
press
hard
he
like
to
give
way
say
i
m
just
an
old
guy
so
i
don
t
know
all
the
in
and
out
of
this
new
stuff
so
if
you
re
sure
it
s
right
let
s
go
he
could
then
observe
with
a
know
smile
i
can
t
lose
now
if
i
be
right
they
ll
soon
be
say
jesus
maybe
the
old
guy
know
the
score
and
if
they
be
right
they
ll
feel
really
good
about
themselves
and
will
work
even
harder
genially
self
mock
in
manner
weinberg

in
the
way
unlike
any
other
prominent
executive
of
his
time
he
be
so
very
natural
that
he
really
didn

didn
t
much
like

which
he
consider
highfalutin
but
he
believe
deeply

even
when
part

it
make

but
he
would
not
accept
anything
short
of
the
whole
truth
when
any

from
ceo
patrick
sheehy
in
london
to
john
weinberg
in
new
york
at
least
in
part
because
goldman
sachs
under

have
three

previously
defend

weinberg
clearly
take
pleasure
in

ceo
for

he
and
coca

ceo
roberto

have
agree
that
the
right
man
to
take
the
helm
at
kodak
be
george
fisher
of
motorola
they
go
to
see
fisher
together
and
as
plan
hit
him
with
both
barrel
first
they
argue
that
a
great
american
corporation
be
flounder
and
fisher
with
his
leadership
quality
and
his
understand
of
technology
be
uniquely
qualify
to
be
ceo
and
to
accomplish
something
of
great
importance
for
this
major
company
and
for
america
second
they
laid
out
an
incentive
package
that
would
make
fisher
a
wealthy
man
if
he
succeed
the
two
men
be
play
to
win
but
they
be
not
make
much
progress
and
certainly
be
not
get
to
the
close
during
a
lull
weinberg
be
alone
with
fisher
who
say
john
it
s
a
great
job
and
a
wonderful
offer
i
know
that
but
i
m
not
go
to
accept
it
even
from
roberto
and
you
and
i
want
to
tell
you
why
my
wife
anne
have
be
wonderful
to
me
and
i
owe
her
the
time
and
the
fun
she
s
clearly
entitle
to
but
she
would
lose
out
on
this
if
i
take
the
job
and
embark
on
a
major
new
challenge
at

go
to
do
that
to
anne

warmly
that

moreover
the

not

for
such
a

what
each

how
stretch
for

the

already
explain
how
and
why
the
need
for
capital
would
increase
steadily
as
the
firm
take
advantage
of
its
growth
opportunity
then
turn
from
carrot
to
stick
they
remind
the
group
that
any
one
or
two
severe
problem
like
penn
central
a

any
of
the

different
kind
of
trouble
that

up
could
suddenly
do
great
harm
to
the
firm
and
its
partner
the
presentation
be
unconvincing
to
some
it
seem
inconsistent
in
several
way
the
thirty
seven
new
partner
would
have
none
of
it
an
ipo
do
almost
nothing
for
them
and
would
preclude
their
building
up
their
capital
position
over
the
next
several
year
they
have
not
begin
to
build
up
their

so
even
though

they
be
one
partner
one
vote
and
all
the
new
and
most
of
the
nearly
new
partner
be
oppose
that
meant
that
while
rubin
and
friedman
could
bring
it
up
again
the
idea
of
an
ipo
be
push
off
for
at

a

confusion
one
thing
be
clear
there
would
be
no
ipo
for
goldman
sachs
but
the
firm
still
need
capital
particularly
since

with

be

john

be
no

he
never

sachs
s
need
for

the

hundred
million

the

would
really
not

up
the

over
nearly
a
hundred
year
sumitomo

would

overnight
by
percent
the

s
need
for
more
capital
long
term
permanent
equity
capital
have
be
the
most
important
argument
for

but
when
the
ipo
have
be
scuttle
in
weinberg
have
certainly
not
be
unhappy
he
believe
strongly
in
the
partnership
just
as
he
believe
in
its
client
relationship
and
he
knew
his
father
would
have
oppose
public
ownership
he
also
believe
in
goldman
sachs
become
the
lead
firm
on
wall
street
and
knew
that
be
go
to
require
more
capital
than
the
partner
could
retain
out
of
current
profit
weinberg
could
barely
contain
himself
because
komatsu
s
visit
be
so
improbable
and
could
be
so
important
you
won
t
believe
this
not
in
a
million
year
but
i
ve
just
have
the
most
amaze
visit
he
exclaim
over
the

to
don

twenty
year
before

always
hit
it
off
gant

that

sensitive
and
require
on
the
spot
good
judgment
in
addition
he
have
do
all
the
detailed
financial
analysis
and
documentation
for
the

so
he
knew
all
the
number
weinberg
cautious
and
deliberate
want
to
check
out
every
aspect
of
sumitomo
s
amaze
proposition
which
be
why
he
turn
to
gant
don
this
may
be
nothing
but
if
it
do
work
out
it
could
be
very
very
big
come
over
to
my
office
right
away
so
i
can
fill
you
in
we
ve
get
work
to
do
when
gant
arrive
at
his
office
weinberg
be
grin
widely
felix
rohatyn
come
in
this
morning
with
two
japanese
guy
wear
dark
glass
one
guy
speaks
only
japanese
but
be
obviously
very
senior
the
other
be
his
translator
the
senior
guy
explains
that
he
doesn
t
want
to
be
recognize
by
any
newspaper
reporter
or
wall
streeters
which
be
why
he
be
wear
dark
glass
and
why
he
have
come
by
such
a
screwball
route
weinberg
laugh
over
the
memory
of
the
human
foible
as
much
as
over
the
strategic
triumph
the
opportunity
present
in
an
industry
where
equity
capital
can
be
leveraged
fifty
time
over
by
firm
with
high
credit
rating
half
a
billion
dollar
of
fresh
equity
capital
could
be
a
mighty
powerful
infusion
still
laugh
weinberg
as
usual
get
quickly
to
the
point
with
gant
don
give
felix
rohatyn
a
call
right
away
to
see
how
serious
this
guy
be
about
what
he
say
to
me
that
sumitomo
bank
want
to
be
a
partner
in
goldman
sachs
see
if
they
re
really
serious
then
chuckle
weinberg
say
who
know
we
may
soon
be
goldman
sake
gant
knew
rohatyn
from
work
together
on
deal
with
m
so
they
talk
candidly
gant
then
report
back
to
weinberg
john
rohatyn
say
sumitomo
be
absolutely
for
real
on
this
we
can
t
just
dismiss
it
they
have
the
money
and
want
to
be
a
silent
partner
if
we
negotiate
this
the
right
way
rohatyn
say
we
can
write
our
own
ticket
be
you
ready
to
take
the
lead
on
the
negotiation
don
know
the
japanese
it
could
take
a
lot
of
time
i
ll
be
okay
lucky
they
didn
t
come
when
gu
be
still
here
observe
weinberg
year
later
he
hat
the
jap
and
didn
t
like
the
french
much
either
never
have
any
interest
in
international
not
even
for
five
second
at
first
the
federal
reserve
board
of
governor
reject
the
application
for
sumitomo
to

institutionally
this
make
sumitomo
very
unhappy
the
bank
felt
set
up
on
a
personal
level
this
rebuff
hurt
the
career
of
sumitomo
s
key
man
in
the
negotiation
because
in
japan
anything
so
important
would
have
be
carefully
precleared
with
the
ministry
of
finance
to
prevent
just
such
surprise
when
sumitomo
bank
be
attempt
to
make
its
huge
investment
in
goldman

there
be
a
lot
of
easy
talk
in
the
united

about
the

buying
up

there

concern
about
any
foreign

to
fill
the

in
as
downey
recall
john
weinberg
be
quite
ready
to
explain
that
sumitomo
have
paid
three
and
a
half
time
book
value
and
that
they
wouldn
t
have
a
voting
interest
in
the

and
all
that
but
he
seem
quite
reluctant
when
i
suggest
he
mention
to
the
congressman
that
he
have
have
experience
with
the
japanese
all
the
way
back
to
the

that
s
why
i
be
so
surprised
when
john
start
right
off
with
say
congressman
don
t
ever
forget
that
in
the
war
we
fought
those
bastard
dingell
cut
in
now
john
but
the
point
on
our
protect
our
independence
have
already
be
make
for
certain
we
have
no
trouble
with
congress
after
that
after
month
of
discussion
and
three
formal
hearing
the

necessary
to
unwind
potential
deal
breaker
simply
by
assure
his
counterpart
that
a
particular
demand
simply
would
never
be
acceptable
to
goldman
sachs
s
management
committee
initially
sumitomo
thought
it
would
want
to
have
all
sort
of
trainee
at
the
firm
but
weinberg
and
gant
explain
that
to
protect
your
investment
it
would
be
important
to
avoid
the
perception
that
goldman
sachs
be
too
close
to
the
sumitomo
group
the
fed
decide
that
sumitomo
could
send
two
not
two
dozen
intern
and
they
could
not
remain
in
new
york
city
for
more
than
twelve
month
before
rotate
home
sumitomo
be
not
at
all
comfortable
with
these
restriction
so
negotiation
continued
to
be
as
gant
later
recall
touch
and
go
one
problem
for
gant
be
find
partner
willing
to
train
a
sumitomo
intern
know
he
would
not
be
stay
more
than
a
year
sumitomo
would
just
be
a
silent
partner
and
not
have
a
vote
again
weinberg
explain
it
be
to
protect
their
investment
in
fact
it
be
the
best
investment
sumitomo
ever
make
because
the
bank
could
fund
its
whole
commitment
in
the
euromarkets
at
a
net
cost
of
just
percent
with
characteristic
genial
understatement
weinberg
observe
it
s
work
out
well
for
everyone
as
background
to
the
sumitomo
story
weinberg
would
later
explain
that
he
have
lot
of
close
friend
in
japan
say
i
ve
be
go
there
for
twenty
five
year
he
be
diplomatic
in
understate
the
reality
that
he
d
actually
be
go
for
more
than
fifty
year
his
first
mission
be
as
a
marine
to
liberate
pow
camp
in
the
early
stage
of
the
u

occupation
as
he
say
i
d
see
a
lot
and
heard
a
lot
about
pow
camp
but
nothing
like
what
i
saw
in
japan
to
get
into
the
marine
corp
weinberg
have
lie
about
his
age
he
be
only
seventeen
since
no
good

nearly
a

later
he
be
call
back
for
a
second
combat
tour
as
a
platoon
leader
in
korea
he
would
regale
friend
with
story
about
event
of
the
war
and
postwar
year
like
the
day
his
life
be
threaten
by
a

who
accompany
him
on

want
young
weinberg
tell
tale
that
might
tarnish
his
promising
back
home
career
in

so
he
make
himself
menacingly
clear
if
anybody
anywhere

about

in
the

of
dignitary
love
the
mercifully
cryptic
remark
because
they
knew
the
real
story
in
the
few
year
after
sumitomo
s
investment
goldman
sachs
s
profit
increase
substantially
and
the
firm
could
readily
have
bought
out
sumitomo

at
the
already
agree
rate
of
one
hundred
million
dollar
a

over

but
didn

because

with
the

sumitomo

astronomical
ironically
however
sumitomo
do
not
achieve
its
strategic
objective
which
be
to
develop
and
use
a
new

it
never
do

in
japan
as
an
intense
competitor
against
other
wall
street
firm
weinberg
place
an
urgent
call
to
fred
frank
at
lehman
brother
about
an
underwriting
lehman
brother
be
about
to
do
without
goldman
sachs
we
brought
that
company
public
so
it
would
be
a
great
embarrassment
to
our
firm
and
to
me
personally
if
we
aren
t
involve
as
a
major
underwriter
in
this
offering
so
fred
i
m
ask
you
frank
arrange
to
have
goldman
sachs
reinstate
simply
say
to
the
client
you
can
t
drop
goldman
sachs
because
it
s
such
a
strong
firm
that
everyone
on
wall
street
will
think
they
drop
you
a
few
year
later
on
a
different
topic
frank
be
back
on
the
phone
with
weinberg
describe
overly
aggressive
behavior
by
a
goldman
sachs
banker
gee
fred
that
s
awful
commiserate
weinberg
ask
for
time
to
look
into
the
situation
and
promising
to
call
back
frank
expect
weinberg
s
contrition
to
result
in
a
satisfy
business
change
so
when
he
next
spoke
with
weinberg
he
ask
well
then
john
will
you
be
able
to
take
care
of
this
and
put
a
stop
to
it
oh
no
fred
certainly
not
come
the
surprising
reply
that
would
be
micromanaging
always
an
unrelenting
competitor
weinberg
be
not
about
to
squelch
his
aggressive
colleague
as
frank
observe
for
goldman
sachs
it
s
not
just
that
they
must
win
but
also
you
must
fail
long
term
relationship
be
particularly
important
to
weinberg
and
he
clearly
felt
most
comfortable
where
the
loyalty
go
both
way
and
be
equally
strong
loyalty
up
loyalty
down
say
the
u
s
marine
when
a
relationship
be
not
work
he
would
work
hard
to
get
it
right
as
illustrate
by
his
work
with
general
electric
weinberg
explain
my
father
have
be
a
longtime
director
of
ge
and
we
be
all
disappointed
that
after
his
death
goldman
sachs
be
not
invite
to
continue
the
relationship
as
co
investment
banker
for
ge
a
traditional
relationship
the
firm
have
enjoy
ge
turn
to
morgan
stanley
to
serve
as
its
lead
investment
banker
weinberg
decide
to
see
what
could
be
do
and
make
a
point
of
show
up
at
ge
s
corporate
office
in
fairfield
connecticut
every
month
over
twelve
long
year
meeting
with
people
particularly
the
new
people
be
brought
into
the
senior
management
group
i
ve
always
gotten
along
pretty
well
with
regular
work
people
so
one
day
i
m
there
and
it
s
pretty
quiet
and
one
of
the
secretary
i
knew
she
typed
all
the
superconfidential
executive
performance
evaluation
say
to
me
there
s
a
new
executive
you
should
see
and
in
another
minute
she
usher
me
into
the
office
of
this
guy
i
d
never
heard
of
before
jack
welch
welch
have
never
heard
of
weinberg
either
so
he
ask
what
s
on
your
mind
weinberg
have
to
admit
i
really
don
t
have
anything
particularly
on
my
mind
and
ask
welch
what
his
responsibility
would
be
at
ge
welch
grin
and
make
a
sarcastic
observation
about
the
value
of
really
do
your
homework
before
call
on
busy
people
and
then
explain
he
be
now
sector
executive
for
several
business
unit
include
ge
credit
weinberg
ask
how
goldman
sachs
could
help
and
welch
grin
again
comment
about
the
importance
of
come
prepared
with
specific
document
proposal
and
action
recommendation
and
ask
don
t
you
ever
do
any
homework
as
weinberg
perceive
however
somehow
we
be
actually
get
along
pretty
well
on
a
personal
level
and
the
next
thing
i
know
he
s
say
how
he
hope
to
become
ge
s
ceo
one
day
and
asks
me
how
goldman
sachs
can
help
him
do
a
great
job
for
the
corporation
we
talk
about
various
thing
and
pretty
soon
thing
seem
to
come
together
for
us
both
over
the
next
several
year
despite
start
out
so
awkwardly
the
two
men
work
together
in
many
way
for
example
the
steel
industry
need
huge
investment
in
continuous
cast
equipment
and
the
irs
allow
a
transfer
of
the
investment
tax
credit
if
the
equipment
be
lease
and
that
s
where
ge
credit
could
come
in
since
the
steel
company
have
little
or
no
profit
and
few
tax
against
which
to
take
the
tax
credit
weinberg
work
out
a
way
for
ge
credit
to
buy
the
equipment
take
the
tax
credit
and
then
lease
the
equipment
to
the
steel
company
weinberg
s
summary
naturally
everybody
be
happy
his
engage
no
pretense
manner
left
weinberg
open
to
good
natured
rib
from
his
many

sometimes
in

in
private
one
on
one
fun
when
jack
welch

his
friend
several
year
later
to
divulge
something
big
happen
at
general
electric
he
begin
the
conversation
in
a
personally
affectionate
way

for
you
re
dumb
you
re
ugly
and
you
re
oh
so
very
lucky
and
then
he
continued
i
m
about
to
be
ask
to
go
into
the
boardroom
when
i
come
out

goal
that
others
often
found
contradictory
cooperative
teamwork
and
aggressive
individual
initiative
and
to
do
so
quickly
decisively
and
fairly
with
no
hard
feeling
within
the
firm
weinberg
s
approach
be
simple
direct
and
effective
he
would
take
the
antagonist
aside
and
move
up
very
close
and
lower
his
voice
would
lay
out
exactly
how
the
problem
would
be
resolve
now
i
m
go
to
decide
this
thing
once
and
for
all
by
noon
tomorrow
so
each
of
you
should
think
very
carefully
about
what
you
really
want
most
include
in
my
final
decision
and
then
tell
me
the
exact
decision
you
d
like
me
to
make
a
decision
you
can
and
you
will
live
with
make
it
just
as
fair
as
you
can
to
the
other
guy
because
he
ll
be
give
me
his
best
and
fairest
final
decision
too
i
m
go
to
pick
just
one
of
those
recommendation
and
that
will
be
that
and
then
we
ll
all
get
back
to
work

innocent
assumption

trip
a
year
to
japan
his
major
work
continued
to
be
in
new
york
serve
john
weinberg
s
client
in
japan
his
office
be
his
hotel
room
and
he
call
on
company
bank
and
security
firm
without
a
translator
most
firm
have
either
native
speaker
or
translator
but
we
have
neither
which
limited
the
substantive
content
of
our
meeting
the
big
four
japanese
security
firm
control
all
the
business
so
all
the
foreign
firm
beat
a
path
to
their
door
smith
recall
it
be
very
competitive
one
day
john
weinberg
believe
smith
be
either
spending
too
much
or
too
little
time
in
japan
told
him
as
bluntly
as
usual
shit
or
get
off
the
pot
so
in
smith
go
full
time
in
the
international
business
concentrate
on
japan
competitor
firm
all
rely
on
the
relationship
they
d
begin
by
get
an
introduction
through
a
japanese
security
firm
but
smith
understood
that
these
introduction
often
result
in
pointless
meeting
with
face
men
i
believe
it
be
well
to
be
know
as
the
smart
people
from
new
york
with
good
idea
that
would
be
interest
to
the
japanese
so
they
would
see
me
and
then
i
could
play
who
do
you
know
make
reference
over
and
over
again
to
henry
fowler
smith
make
appointment
with
senior
executive
through
those
earlier
contact
whenever
he
could
and
as
he
recall
sent
a
lot
of
letter
those
early
day
be
never
easy
and
some
of
the
difficulty
be
quite
remarkable
for
example
there
usually
be
no
street
number
on
tokyo
building
and
any
number
that
be
there
be
not
in
numerical
sequence
along
a
street
as
in
the
west
but
in
the
chronological
order
in
which
the
building
have
be
construct
so
to
keep
from
get
lose
smith
have
to
get
a
taxi
with
a
driver
who
spoke
some
english
language
be
a
persistent
problem
during
an
initial
sale
call
smith
might
say
thank
you
for
see
me
i
be
from
goldman
sachs
without
know
that
zachs
in
japanese
be
the
word
for
condom
smith
decide
not
to
live
in
japan
believe
that
the
business
development
effort
would
collapse
if
he
wasn
t
base
in
the
new
york
office
networking
and
lobbying
with
partner
and
then
go
back
to
japan
with
the
new
and
freshest
idea
if
i
d
be
in
tokyo
and
out
of
touch
with
key
people
in
the
firm
we
d
never
have
gotten
japanese
business
accepted
by
the
management
committee
in
new
york
where
everyone
seem
to
think
that
japanese
business
be
really
just
junk
bond
business
issue
commercial
paper
for
mitsui
a
three
hundred
year
old
company
where
henry
fowler
have
a
friend
from
his
time
as
treasury
secretary
promise
to
be
the
firm
s
first
breakthrough
in
japan
but
the
u
s
commercial
paper
market
wouldn
t
accept
japanese
paper
smith
s
solution
be
to
arrange
a
u
s
bank
letter
of
credit
as
backup
an
innovation
that
reassure
investor
about
the
credit
quality
once
mitsui
s
paper
have
be
accepted
in
the
u
s
market
smith
go
to
every
major
japanese
company
he
could
identify
marketing
the
pant
off
the
idea
of
issue
commercial
paper
as
a
low
cost
way
to
raise
money
and
get
several
other
japanese
company
to
issue
u
s
commercial
paper
it
be
an
opportunistic
time
he
remembers
and
we
would
try
anything
that
work
a
year
later
goldman
sachs
do
a
convertible
bond
for
mitsui
and
this
significantly
increase
the
firm
s
stature
in
japan
an
early
japanese
equity
offering
by
goldman
sachs
be
for
wacoal
a
brassiere
maker
smith
point
out
that
wacoal
make
more
bra
than
anyone
else
in
the
world
this
be
a
surprise
to
the
new
yorkers
since
japanese
woman
be
not
as
endow
as
american
woman
who
be
you
go
to
sell
this
to
ask
john
weinberg
institution
reply
smith
you
ll
have
a
lot
of
explain
to
do
say
weinberg
with
a
grin
wacoal
want
to
be
certain
the
share
would
get
the
firm
s
support
in
the
aftermarket
as
smith
later
explain
before
we
could
get
the
assignment
we
have
to
promise
we
would
do
the
underwriting
successfully
and
then
after
we
get
the
mandate
we
have
to
study
the
data
to
see
if
and
how
we
could
actually
do
the
underwriting
the
deal
be
successful
and
make
a
nice
profit
goldman

we
be
out

sight
out
of
mind
and
free
to
figure
it
out
for
ourselves
i
call
on
an
awful
lot
of
people
to
introduce
myself
and
to
talk
about
the
firm
goldman
sachs
be
virtually
unknown
in

london
so
it
have
to

demonstrably
superior
wedge
product

break
into
the
market
fortunately
we

just
such
a

the

clearly
deliverable
and
clearly
differentiate

could
raise

significantly
low
interest
rate
than
the
british
bank

i
wasn

there

how

because
british
subject

unimportant
to
london
and

it
have
also
be
do
a
minor
export

smith
s
mission
be
to
build
up
these
business
and
to
see
if
the
firm
could
develop
some
indigenous
investment
banking
business
in
the
uk
and
on
the
continent
eurobonds
be
one
possibility
but
bidding
by
competitor
be
so
aggressive
that
as
smith
explains
win
these
mandate
could
also
be
an
easy
way
to
lose
a
lot
of
money
in
late
summer
of
goldman
sachs
acquire
the
london
merchant
banking
arm
of
a
u
s
bank
to
help
in
financing
j
aron
s
global
commodity
business
and
rename
it
goldman
sachs
ltd
in
the
early
s
international
business
represent
percent
or
more
of
the
firm
s
bond
and
m
a
business
and
a
bit
less
than
percent
in
stockbrokerage
but
still
only
percent
of
the
firm
s
total
revenue
and
it
be
lose
money
but
by
the
late
s
international
would
contribute
percent
of
the
firm
s
profit
transform
goldman
sachs
into
an
international
powerhouse
would
require
great
change
in
both
substance
and
perception
inside
the
firm
and
among
thousand
of
client
and
nonclients
from
to
lone
star
gas
have
use
only
two
firm
for
its
many
transaction
goldman
sachs
and
salomon
brother
lone
star
be
the
ultimate
loyal
client
sanford
singer
the
cfo
really
like
goldman
sachs
and
salomon
brother
and
he
knew
the
firm
be
do
great
work
for
him
in
america
but
when
he
have
a
small
piece
of
business
to
be
do
in
europe
he
never
even
thought
of
call
goldman
sachs
here
be
our
most
loyal
client
simply
assume
we
have
no
capability
and
no
interest
in
thing
international
say
smith
obviously
if
our
best
client
won
t
call
us
we
must
be
very
vulnerable
with
all
our
other
client
think
back
on
the
disruption
of
may
day
which
end
fix
u
s
brokerage
commission
in
smith
say
if
we
d
know
what
lay
ahead
for
the
stockbrokerage
business
with
its
drastic
collapse
in
commission
rate
we
would
have
be
very
tempt
to
close
up
shop
fortunately
we
have
the
leadership
of
gu
levy
who
be
unafraid
as
be
john
whitehead
you
can
do
anything
they
say
and
they
meant
it
go
out
and
call
we
have
the
capital
and
we
have
the
people
so
in
the
eighty
while
competitor
soften
and
slow
down
their
international
effort
goldman
sachs
toughen
up

notice
a
line
on
the
list
of
occupant
of

in
a
large
london
building

check
it
out
get
off

he
ask
the

with
whom
he
might
speak
about

be
told
to
talk
to

have
to

very
short
term
bob

might
have
be
expect
to

he
be
strongly
in

of
the
commitment
to
building
the
firm
s
international
business
we
know
capital
market
and
trading
in
way
the
asian
and
european
may
never
know
they
don
t
understood
how
to
use
capital
in
trading
it
take
year
to
learn
block
trading
and
they
may
never
figure
out
how
to
do
it
properly
as
so
often
before
menschel
and
mnuchin
do
not
agree
richard
menschel
be
skeptical
of
a
major
international
expansion
we
have
great
opportunity
right
here
in
america
we
know
how
to
win
this
game
we
know
we
have
the
people
who
can
do
it
and
we
know
we
can
make
lot
of
money
now
menschel
be
not
alone
many
partner
take
a
similar
view
make
a
big
push
to
go
international
would
be
a
waste
of
time
and
a
waste
of
opportunity
to
make
money
we
can
make
much
more
profit
by
building
up
our
already
strong
domestic
business
ran
their
argument
this
be
no
time
to
pull
our
best
young
lion
and
tiger
who
be
rapidly
building
up
the
business
they
generate
right
where
they
be
off
the
line
in
big
market
to
redeploy
them
into
market
like
london
and
paris
which
may
have
famous
name
but
be
really
very
small
business
opportunity
and
even
small
profit
opportunity
if
europe
or
asia
japan
really
be
a
major
long
term
business
opportunity
we
can
go
after
it
in
five
year
or
even
ten
year
it
will
still
be
there
let
competitor
bash
their
head
against
the
wall
of
regulation
different
culture
and
language
entrench
nationalistic
relationship
anti
americanism
and
all
that
stuff
while
we
build
up
our
profit
and
our
capital
and
our
organization
in
our
huge
home
market
the
big
best
market
in
the
whole
world
and
with
five
more

what
we

the

could
find
the

there

other
way
we

helpful
wilson
knew
that

badly
to
meet
with
a
key
european
union
regulatory
official
in
brussels
who

prove
completely
unavailable
so
he
ask
chiene
for
advice
on
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
arrange
such
a
meeting

and
will
call
you
back
when
would
you
most
like
to

if

can
be
arrange
no
need
to
tell
freeman
that
he
have
know
tugendhat
for
year
have
retain
him
as
a

out
of

want
to
run

tugendhat
take
chiene

call

and

he
would
be
delighted
to
meet
at
any
time
on
any
day
in
less
than
ten
minute
the
inaccessible
and
essential
official
have
an
appointment
with
freeman
at
just
the
right
time
and
chiene
have
make
a
vital
point
wood
mac
be
good
at
get
thing
do
the
partner
of
both
goldman
sachs
and
wood
mackenzie
be
begin
to
think
of
a
possible
combination
the
conclusion
of
wood
mackenzie
s
annual
partner
business
planning
weekend
be
that
the
future
would
bring
transatlantic
ownership
of
security
firm
but
by
whom
not
know
the
answer
chiene
go
across
to
new
york
and
call
on
every
major
firm
after
meeting
dick
menschel
and
others
chiene
conclude
it
s
a
no
brainer
goldman
sachs
be
clearly
number
one
after
britain
s
big
bang
in
brought
deregulation
and
substantially
open
up
the
firm
of
london
previously
close
by
law
to
outside
ownership
goldman
sachs
be
interested
in
acquire
a
percent
stake
in
wood
mac
the
large
amount
then
allowable
so
a
full
day
of
discussion
and
a
dinner
be
arrange
in
new
york
city
chiene
prepared
a
thirty
page
tell
all
memo
on
wood
mackenzie
and
discussion
during
the
day
be
so
candid
and
forthcoming
that
dick
menschel
say
we
ve
told
you
more
about
our
firm
s
operation
and
profitability
than
we
ve
ever
told
anyone
else
the
discussion
go
smoothly
goodwill
be
steadily
increase
on
both
side
after
a
short
break
the
discussion
be
to
be
picked
up
again
during
dinner
the
purchase
price
set
at
million
be
too
much
for
goldman
sachs
s
management
committee
to
pay
for
a
strictly
agency
broker
in
the
uk
but
if
american
style
block
trading
could
be
add
perhaps
a
deal
could
be
struck
bob
mnuchin
would
be
critical
to
any
major
move
base
on
the
potential
profitability
of
block
trading
because
that
be
clearly
his
business
as
the
fifteen
wood
mackenzie
partner
and
their
counterpart
from
goldman
sachs
sat
down
for
dinner
the
day
s
open
cordiality
be
displace
the
even
s
discussion
be
dominate
by
mnuchin
s
increasingly
aggressive
question
about
how
wood
mac
be
organize
for
trading
particularly
block
trading
as
mnuchin
s
manner
become
more
and
more
belligerent
mnuchin
s
partner
recognize
alcohol
as
the
probable
cause
but
the
scottish
visitor
didn
t
realize
what
be
go
on
while
chiene
and
others
try
to
clarify
politely
that
in
london
a
firm
be
either
an
agency
broker
or
a
market
maker
and
could
not
be
both
mnuchin
didn
t
get
it
and
persist
in
press
his
tougher
and
tougher
question
in
an
increasingly
argumentative
way
the
meeting
rapidly
deteriorate
until
it
could
continue
no
longer
as
the
even
broke
up
mnuchin
and
chiene
take
a
cab
uptown
together
as
chiene
observe
year
later
it
be
a
long
cab
ride
the
next
morning
chiene
get
a
call
from
a
goldman
sachs
partner
we
re
told
bob
really
bombed
last
night
s
meeting
yes
he
do
the
discussion
be
over
forever
and
another
way
would
have
to
be
found
to
build
a
significant
business
in
london
and
europe
as
steel
later
explain
you
could
argue
that
the
buildup
would
have
be
faster
with
an
acquisition
but
most
of
such
combination
have
prove
to
be
costly
disappointment
usually
within
just
a
few
year
time
big
bang
in
not
only
allow
agency
broker
to
combine
with
market
make
dealer
gilt
british
treasury
bond
dealer
and
merchant
bank
it
allow
foreign
bank
and
firm
to
buy
into
british
firm
in
a
flurry
of
activity
over
twenty
combination
be
effect
in
just
two
year
almost
all
be
soon
failure
after
substantial
debate
and
disagreement
the
strong
leader
prevail
particularly
john
weinberg
and
jim
gorter
head
of
the
chicago
regional
office
and
one
of
the
real
power
in
the
firm
the
decision
be
make
in
late
to
build
not
buy
and
to
build
as
quickly
as
possible
as
david
silfen
recall
we
could
see
the
first
indication
of
major
change
develop
in
europe
change
that
be
come
our
way
so
we
make
the
decision
to
pull
some
of
our
very
best
young
people
out
of
their
position
in
chicago
los
angeles
and
new
york
and
send
them
over
say
you
have
two
responsibility
first
figure
out
how
to
build
a
significant
and
sustainable
business
over
there
and
build
it
second
find
your
successor
somebody
with
a
local
passport
and
show
him
or
her
how
to
be
very
successful
after
that
you
can
come
back
home
for
those
who
be
successful
the
promise
of
a
partnership
didn
t
need
to
be
spell
out
bob
steel
remembers
dick
menschel
say
to
him
some
clown
will
call
you
and

jeff
weingarten
and
pat
ward
be
among
the
pride
of
ten
young
lion
who
go
to
join
bill
landreth
and
john
thornton
in
london
and
henry
james
in
tokyo
to
transform
those
office
from
remote
overseas
outpost
into
major
international
center
and
to
take
the
profit
from
marginal
to
major
the
talent
infusion
comprise
some
new
partner
still
determine
to
prove
themselves
and
some
almost
partner
with
at
least
equal
determination
all
believe
they
could
certainly
do
good
and
maybe
great
business
by
sell
sophisticated
service
service
they
knew
well
from
experience
in
america
into
european
market
where
the
local
banker
and
broker
have
have
no
experience
with
many
kind
of
transaction
the
pan
european
market
be
just
develop
so
no
indigenous
firm
and
no
international
competitor
have
entrench
position
in
the
early
year
the
firm
rarely
sent
over
its
best
people
acknowledges
thornton
predictably
in
those
circumstance
the
most
outstanding
european
professional
be
not
go
to
join
the
firm
either
just
say
we
want
to
be
global
and
excellent
be
not
enough
even
after
the
firm
start
to
invest
seriously
in
europe
most
of
our
best
people
chose
to
stay
home
focus
on
u
s
client
and
do
familiar
transaction
with
well
establish
strategy
with
assure
high
margin
revenue
and
profit
so
in
europe
we
decide
to
take
the
hand
we
d
be
dealt
and
do
the
best
we
could
through
intensity
of
focus
and
effort
our
recruiting
and
business
development
have
to
be
do
country
by
country
so
as
to
build
critical
mass
in
each
market
once
you
succeed
in
recruiting
one
outstanding
european
it
be
easy
to
get
a
second
and
a
third
and
so
on
we
start
in
the
uk
and
expand
to
france
and
germany
and
then
the
other
major
economy
when
steel
arrive
in
london
from
chicago
in
february
assign
to
build
a
large
profitable
stockbrokerage
business
base
on
trading
and
arbitrage
goldman
sachs
be
do
only
a
modest
twenty
million
dollar
annual
business
sell
american
share
to
british
and
continental
institution
in
roughly
equal
proportion
along
with
a
few
tire
broker
peddle
british
share
it
be
clearly
not
an
important
business
but
steel
s
mandate
have
be
make
clear
to
him
if
you
make
this
business
important
to
the
firm
the
firm
will
make
you
a
partner
that
be
not
go
to
be
easy
the
british
share
business
be
large
in
volume
but
very
low
in
profit
margin
while
the
american
share
business
be
grow
in
volume
but
margin
be
shrink
as
commission
be
negotiate
low
and
low
the
best
hope
be
to
convert
a
low
profit
agency
business
into
a
profitable
proprietary
dealer
business
with
arbitrage
primarily
in
two
dozen
dual
list
stock
include
bp
ici
royal
dutch
shell
and
tokio
marine
that
have
share
in
london
and
american
depositary
receipt
in
new
york
where
an
american
firm
have
a
comparative
advantage
we
realize
that
with
big
bang
institution
would
soon
be
dominate
the
stock
market
and
their
demand
for
liquidity
would
increase
a
lot
recall
partner
peter
sachs
this
meant
block
trading
would
come
to
london
and
this
would
change
the
market
so
much
that
the
whole
process
of
corporate
deal
would
speed
up
with
big
bang
banker
dealer
and
broker
would
be
combine
and
market
be
sure
to
move
upstairs
and
require
huge
capital
base
the
london
broker
and
merchant
banker
have
little
capital
so
not
only
be
they
unable
to
defend
their
home
turf
they
couldn
t
attack
ours
it
be
classic
clausewitz
we
knew
from
our
u
s
experience
with
may
day
just
what
kind
of
future
london
be
move
into
with
big
bang
so
we
knew
we
could
create
a
major
business
but
first
we
have
to
become
a
strong
indigenous
firm
or
merchant
bank
though
the
stockbrokerage
business
usually
ran
at
or
near
breakeven
on
routine
business
a
skillful
and
commit
trading
firm
could
see
most
of
the
trading
possibility
so
it
could
pick
and
choose
the
best
opportunity
for
profitable
trading
on
top
of
this
base
business
any
underwriting
business
a
firm
do
would
bring
in
almost
pure
profit
the
last
thing
london
s
establish
firm
want
be
to
share
those
limited
revenue
with
newcomer
and
outsider
like
goldman
sachs
the
british
firm
waste
no
love
on
american
try
to
muscle
in
on
their
business
remembers
steel
particularly
since
it
really
wasn
t
a
very
big
business
office
be
shabby
trading
be
all
agency
business
and
there
be
too
little
business
to
share
and
yet
there
we
be
steel
decide
to
reconnoiter
the
situation
by
call
on
major
client
to
see
how
the
firm
be
perceive
and
how
it
could
increase
its
business
i
go
over
to
king
william
street
to
see
mercury
asset
management
by
far
the
large
account
in
london
and
in
all
of
europe
to
see
what
our
strategy
ought
to
be
and
how
we
could
build
on
the
base
of
our
u
s
share
business
where
we
knew
we
be
get
ten
percent
to
twelve
percent
of
their
brokerage
business
the
first
thing
steel
learn
be
that
mercury
s
u
s
share
business
be
just
a
tiny
fraction
of
its
total
brokerage
commission
volume
while
goldman
sachs
have
an
okay
competitive
position
in
american
share
that
business
be
really
unimportant
to
mercury
and
as
just
an
american
share
broker
goldman
sachs
be
unimportant
too
the
fact
that
goldman
sachs
be
do
pretty
well
as
a
broker
in
u
s
share
do
not
matter
one
iota
to
the
people
at
mercury
who
be
do
the
really
big
business
in
british
share
japanese
share
german
dutch
french
or
italian
share
finally
every
investment
group
domestic
british
or
japanese
or
continental
be
on
a
separate
floor
of
mercury
s
building
every
group
make
investment
decision
and
allocate
brokerage
commission
in
its
own
particular
way
to
be
important
overall
to
this
very
important
account
goldman
sachs
would
have
to
build
relationship
on
each
and
every
floor
almost
always
start
near
zero
and
compete
against
formidable
establish
competition
so
that
s
what
we
set
out
to
do
say
steel
i
go
to
the
management
committee
and
say
we
should
hire
two
and
a
half
time
as
many
people
as
we
have
the
management
committee
say
go
and
we
hire
twelve
people
that
first
year
we
hire
people
with
talent
drive
and
skill
thirty
to
thirty
five
year
old
who
knew
their
business
and
be
ambitious
by
offering
them
the
chance
to
work
with
the
big
account
they
would
have
have
to
wait
ten
or
twenty
year
to
take
over
at
their
old
firm
we
have
zero
turnover
in
our
people
while
other
firm
suffer
twenty
percent
to
thirty
percent
turnover
and
we
add
three
percent
to
six
percent
through
new
hire
each
year
all
mba
and
focus
on
the
discipline
of
go
for
dollar
in
the
recruiting
interview
we
learn
a
lot
about
how
the
city
really
work
and
how
the
game
be
really
played
for
example
we
learn
that
senior
people
of
the
patrician
london
brokerage
firm
cazenove
would
give
research
insight
first
to
favor
client
who
be
insider
in
the
old
boy
network
so
they
could
get
invest
ahead
of
the
other
institutional
investor
we
didn
t
think
that
be
an
ethical
way
to
do
business
fortunately
for
goldman
sachs
and
the
other
american
invader
the
establish
british
firm
make
serious
strategic
mistake
some
join
with
commercial
bank
to
get
capital
but
along
with
the
capital
they
get
stultify
commercial
bank
management
and
commercial
banker
concept
of
compensation
and
risk
take
which
soon
smother
the
acquire
brokerage
unit
some
brokerage
firm
combine
with
other
broker
to
get
scale
but
do
not
get
the
capital
they
would
soon
need
for
market
make
s
g
warburg
then
britain
s
strong
merchant
bank
disperse
its
once
formidable
strength
with
an
unfortunate
acquisition
strategy
of
buying
up
one
of
the
two
or
three
lead
brokerage
firm
in
each
country
on
the
continent
that
strategy
would
doom
the
once
great
firm
to
a
business
model
with
a
high
cost
structure
but
only
mediocre
revenue
and
to
strategic
sclerosis
with
proud
local
executive
experienced
in
their
own
national

hold
on
to
their

and
their

while

to

their
local

from
the
disruptive

that
be

for
an
integrate
firm
to
become
cost
effective
cost
effectiveness
be
clearly
the
strategic
imperative
as
the
business
go
from
close
and
protect
national
market
to
open
market
with
intense
international
competition
steadily
erode

structure
most
continental

try
to
combine
with

of
other
country
which
make
them
like
s
g
warburg
high
cost
rigid
structure
outfit
this
unfortunate
strategy
make
it
almost
easy
for
the
american
particularly
goldman
sachs
morgan
stanley
and
merrill
lynch
to
break
through
with
aggressive
speed
and
flexibility
while
s
g
warburg
bought
the
firm
of
the
past
and
imprison
itself
in
an
inflexible
balkanize
high

organizational
structure
goldman
sachs
begin
recruiting
one
by
one
the
best
individual
for
the
future
while
keep
cost
under
control
and
maintain
flexibility
equally
important
goldman
sachs
appreciate
the
inevitable
direction
and
formidable
magnitude
of
change
that
lay
ahead
for
every
firm
have
just
experienced
the
same
revolutionary
market
transformation
to
institutional
dominance
in
america
the
most
important
objective
particularly
in
investment
research
would
be
to
shift
the
firm
from
be
perceive
as
the
risky
here
today
go
tomorrow
american
firm
that
nobody
who
be
really
any
good
would
feel
safe
in
join
to
the

to
stay

visible
strength
in

a
few
key

be
essential
at
this
juncture
the
firm
get
lucky
because
as
always
chance
favor
the
prepared
mind
after

up
in

reading

at

and
complete
his

gavyn
davy
go
to
no

with

he
then
join

he
work
with

year
before
they
go
together
to
simon
coates
with
the
loom
prospect
of
big
bang
we
felt
it
necessary
to
upgrade
our
employer
say
davy
we
decide
in
to
investigate
the
wall
street
firm
and
thought
morgan
stanley
or
goldman
sachs
would
be
right
but
we
didn
t
actually
know
anyone
we
knew
that
goldman
sachs
have
no
international
economist
so
i
call
lee

he
pass
me
on
to

what
you

so
i
can
t
give

that
be
effectively
the
end
of
that
a

an

to
cover
these
new
market
they
do
a
search
recall
davy
and
found
david
morrison
and
me
why
should
we
go
there
now
ask
morrison
cautiously
they
didn
t
hire
us
when
we
offer
ourselves
to
them
a
year
ago
but
a
year
have
pass
and
they
could
now
credit
goldman
sachs
with
be
commit
to
develop
strength
in
research
and
have
some
basic
knowledge
of
the
major
economy
of
europe
davy
be
increasingly
confident
that
goldman
sachs
be
a
win
firm
and
that
he
and
morrison
could
be
winner
within
goldman
sachs
a
double
multiplier
they
become
the
european
economics
team
at
goldman
sachs
and
then
expand
their
international
coverage
to
include
japan
and
asia
while
bob
giordano
built
up
the
u

operation
which
davy
and
morrison
then
integrate
into
a
whole
not

with
an

as

be
be
integrate

and
institutional

expand
their

so
everyone
be
suddenly
look
for

and
the

at

recall

take
the

seriously
the
u

but
that
be
not
the

because
david

for

the

found
his

valuable
because
morrison
have
a
keen
eye
for
short

at
the

and
in
less
than
two
year
we
each
gain

partly
because
the

knew
it
need
to

this

get
into
a
london
cab
at
the
savoy
hotel
at
seven
one
morning
and
give
his
destination
to
the
driver
who
turn
and
ask
another
cabbie
this
gentleman
s
go
to
the
city
can
you
guess
which
address
the
answer
seem
obvious
to
both
goldman
sachs
for
breakfast
the
cfo
of
vickers
told
a
partner
if
a
british
merchant
banker
be
up
all
night
work
to
complete
a
transaction
he
would
never
tell
anyone
for
fear
he
would
look
inadequately
skillful
but
if
an
american
pull
an
all
nighter
he
would
make
certain
to
tell
me
as
proof
of
his
commitment
from
the
begin
thornton
recall
we
decide
to
focus
on
two
group
of
potential
client
the
lead
blue
chip
company
which
we
knew
would
take
a
long
time
to
win
over
and
company
which
be
in
difficulty
and
be
therefore
more
likely
to
be
open
to
fresh
think
and
new
adviser
we
believe
that
we
need
to
advise
one
consequential
person
or
company
in
one
significant
transaction
and
then
a
second
and
a
third
until
one
day
we
would
have
a
compelling
record
of
distinctive
advice
and
impressive
result
in
after
three
year
of
quietly
building
the
business
almost
invisibly
exactly
this
begin
to
happen
that
year
we
defend
four
of
the
five
first
ever
one
billion
pound
hostile
takeover
and
be
successful
in
keep
three
of
the
target

independent
thornton
explains
in
a
situation
like
this
at
the
very
begin
you
as
an
individual
be
the
brand
you
have
nothing
to
carry
you
and
nothing
to
fall
back
on
go
from
an
initial
meeting
and
general
discussion
to
specific
nuanced
advice
that
be
listen
to
and
accepted
be
a
transformation
that
s
completely
dependent
on
you
what
you
say
and
do
how
you
develop
each
relationship
how
you
build
up
the
prospect
s
confidence
not
just
in
your
firm
not
just
in
your
advice
but
in
you
and
that
confidence
have
to
be
strong
enough
to
prevail
against
the
tide
of
general
opinion
and
natural
resistance
to
change
which
be
particularly
strong
in
major
financial
transaction
the
typical
ceo
be
sixty
and
i
be
twenty
eight
a
kid
how
could
i
persuade
the
ceo
to
trust
me
and
decide
to
rely
on
me
the
answer
seem
obvious
be
distinctive
so
you
can
t
be
replicate
by
others
and
in
do
so
build
the
necessary
personal
trust
and
confidence
eventually
of
course
this
would
translate
into
respect
and
trust
the
firm
but
it
take
a
long
time
another
obvious
answer
be
to
get
help
from
new
york

of
harry
sachs

deal
the

also
the
best
client
of
the

how
can
we

the
british

do
the

we
brought

personal
commitment
such
as
peter
sachs
s
be
like
the
first
few
robin
of
spring
an
early
indication
of
the
commitment
of
american
firm
like
goldman
sachs
where
the
london
organization
go
from
people
to
in
just
four
year
such
commitment
would
bring
major

in
the

in
institutional

only
ninth
eric
we
have
a
problem
and
you
have
an
opportunity
go
figure
out
how
to
fix
it
in
equity
underwriting
with
all
our
strength
goldman
sachs
should
rank
first
gorter
give
dobkin
one
key
advantage
freedom
to
pick
his
own
team
after
gorter
hung
up
dobkin
forty
two
be
worried
really
worried
i
have
no
idea
what
to
do
he
recall
the
next
day
i
have
no
idea
what
to
do
and
the
next
day
i
have
no
idea
what
to
do
and
i
m
start
to
lose
sleep
finally
on
the
fourth
day
i
m
stand
in
the
shower
when
i
have
an
aha
and
realize
what
we
have
to
do
turn
the
whole
syndicate
business
on
its
head
for
decade
the
underwriting
business
have
be
organize
around
the
traditional
critical
need
to
get
distribution
for
the
new
issue
when
a
corporation
need
to
raise
capital
retail
broker
have
the
account
with
individual
investor
so
syndicate
of
retail
brokerage
firm
be
organize
to
gain
access
to
the
many
thousand
of
individual
investor
that
be
realistically
unknown
to
the
major
underwriter
who
originate
issue
as
wholesaler
the
underwriter
traditionally
focus
on
their
client
the
corporate
issuer
this
system
work
when
the
business
be
dominate
by
retail
investor
but
by
the
early
eighty
the
security
business
be
dominate
by
institution
for
an
institutional
market
with
professional
investor
make
all
the
decision
the
old
syndicate
business
be
completely
obsolete
it
add
little
value
because
it
require
no
understand
of
each
investor
s
portfolio
strategy
how
he
make
investment
decision
why
he
might
or
might
not
buy
a
particular
offering
and
the
role
his
research
analyst
played
old
line
underwriter
have
no
understand
of
the
new
world
of
institutional
marketing
and
distribution
and
didn
t
know
how
to
craft
a
strong
sale
pitch
or
organize
an
effective
road
show
for
audience
of
experienced
professionally
skeptical
institutional
investor
they
didn
t
even
know
enough
to
rehearse
their
presentation
marvel
dobkin
in
retrospect
in
his
shower
stall
epiphany
dobkin
realize
almost
immediately
how
goldman
sachs
could
easily
outflank
such
out
of
date
out
of
touch
ossify
competition
all
we
have
to
do
be
take
the
skill
and
strategy
we
d
developed
while
serve
institution
in
the
secondary
market
and
apply
them
to
do
business
in
the
primary
market
we
d
need
salesman
who
could
really
sell
the
fact
that
goldman
sachs
have
the
best
institutional
relationship
and
the
best
access
to
the
best
institutional
shareholder
and
that
we
know
how
to
merchandise
interest
investment
idea
to
the
most
attractive
institution
establishment
firm
all
have
the
same
priority
protect
their
old
business
the
business
senior
executive
know
best
and
be
best
at
do
often
that
s
also
the
business
with
the
high
profit
history
cloaked
in
the
folklore
of
the
organization
but
business
model
don
t
work
forever
as
client
change
and
client
need
change
any
intermediary
need
to
change
a
once
great
business
model
can
become
a
dangerous
sacred
cow
when
it
get
old
and
tire
and
profit
start
fading
yet
change
be
difficult
hardly
anyone
want
to
wrench
away
from
the
traditional
comfortable
way
of
do
business
simply
because
the
traditional
way
be
not
fulfil
client
need
or
preference
wall
street
s
traditional
underwriting
syndicate
be
elaborate
expression
of
just
such
legacy
issue
the
rule
that
govern
syndicate
participation
be
more
like
those
of
a
fraternity
than
those
of
a
hard
nose
pay
for
performance
business
the
major
underwriting
firm
care
deeply
about
maintain
their
traditional
position
in
each
company
s
underwritings
because
the
lead
investment
banking
firm
that
originate
the
corporate
stock
and
bond
offering
do
not
have
retail
distribution
they
need
the
wirehouse
retail
stockbroker
for
distribution
so
the
wirehouses
be
powerful
powerful
resister
of
change
with
retail
broker
talk
only
to
individual
investor
and
underwriter
talk
only
to
corporate
issuer
nobody
be
organize
to
serve
both
side
so
goldman
sachs
position
itself
right
in
the
middle
of
the
action
the
major
change
on
the
buy
side
that
come
with
the
strong
growth
of
institutional
invest
create
a
vacuum
institutional

want
new
service
that
met
their
need
which
be
quite

well

and
why
the

be
move
away
from

toward
institutional

and
a
local
retail
brokerage
office
in
say
st
louis
or
indianapolis
couldn
t
possibly
meet
the

requirement
of
institutional

and

research
large

direct

goldman
sachs
organize
itself
to
sell
very
large
amount
of

in
an

by
develop
a
rigorous

and
marketing
plan
for

transaction
before
the
underwriting
come
to
market
if
federate
department
store
be
the
issue
company
then
goldman
sachs
s
retail
industry
analyst
joe
elli
would
go
out
and
visit
with
the
major
institution
one
day
in
los
angeles
one
day
in
san
francisco
one
in
minneapolis
mostly

investor

two
day
in
chicago
three
day
in
boston
three
or
four
in
new
york
city
and
one
in
philadelphia
at
each
institution
elli
would
review
the
retailing
industry
with
the
institution
s
retail
analyst
and
one
or
more
portfolio
manager
define
federate
s
competitive
position
its
strategy
and
its
prospect
cite
the
key
data
for
the
current
year
explain
the
prospect
and
answer
any
and
all
question
the
salesman
who
go
with
elli
to
make
all
the
appropriate
introduction
would
focus
on
gauge
the
depth
and
degree
of
interest
size
up
potential
demand
and
planning
the
best
way
to
get
a
major
order
from
each
institution
if
we
have
the
time
we
do
all
the
same
work
when
the
firm
have
a
big
block
of
stock
to
sell
explains
dobkin
so
none
of
this
be
new
to
us
or
to
the
account
first
we
have
to
recognize
that
in
an
institutional
market
the
big
difference
be
the
number
of
zero
and
the
amount
of
time
we
would
have
to
organize
and
execute
effectively
order
size
be
large
time
to
execute
be
shorter
plus
in
the
equity
capital
market
business
we
be
work
in
the
primary
market
so
unlike
with
everyday
new
issue
we
now
have
the
issuer
corporate
management
on
our
side
actively
work
with
us
and
we
seldom
have
to
risk
our
own
capital
our
equity
capital
market
underwriting
business
be
similar
to
the
old
system
in
only
one
way
we
have
an
sec
prospectus
because
those
be
the
sec
s
rule
we
do
not
issue
a
write
research
report
during
the
sell
period
but
we
do
send
our
rainmaker
analyst
around
the
circuit
to
lay
the
groundwork
for
the
actual
offering
besides
just
because
there
be
no
formal
write
research
report
that
didn
t
mean
our
salesman
couldn
t
recite
the
key
fact
and
tell
the
story
as
our
industry
analyst
saw
it
at
the
same
time
the
firm
would
identify
the
probable
major
buyer
work
with
corporate
management
to
craft
the
right
story
and
set
the
right
price
the
firm
could
custom
tailor
sell
to
the
institutional
market
institution
by
institution
because
goldman
sachs
knew
from
all
its
day
to
day
work
with
the
institution
what
each
institution
want
and
how
it
make
its
investment
decision
dobkin
and
his
team
would
sit
down
with
the
key
corporate
executive
and
say
here
s
the
right
way
to
merchandise
your
company
s
stock
to
each
of
the
specific
institution
we
know
you
really
want
as
investor
and
then
demonstrate
that
they
knew
the
institutional
market
at
every
level
portfolio
manager
analyst
and
trader
and
knew
how
to
employ
goldman
sachs
s
investment
research
and
how
to
deal
in
block
dobkin
recall
the
corporate
executive
found
it
all
quite
fascinate
and
this
give
us
an
edge
we
also
show
the
corporate
executive
that
we
be
real
people
not
stuffy
pompous
investment
banker
like
those
from
other
firm
who
didn
t
really
know
either
the
corporation
or
the
institution
we
put
a
wedge
in
between
the
issuer
and
old
line
underwriting
house
like
kuhn
loeb
lehman
brother
and
dillon
read
because
we
knew
the
institution
inside
out
and
they
really
didn
t
then
we
put
another
wedge
versus
the
retail
stockbrokerage
firm
because
the
corporation
believe
that
with
increase
ownership
among
high
quality
institutional
investor
their
stock
s
price
earnings
ratio
go
up
because
we
be
create
demand
for
their
share
through
good
marketing
the
old
way
of
underwriting
be
basically
adversarial
and
one
side
at
that
because
the
underwriting
syndicate
always
line
up
with
the
corporate
client
issue
the
stock
and
then
push
the
share
through
the
retail
system
to
individual
investor
but
dobkin
say
wait
we
do
this
kind
of
sell
to
these
institution
every
day
it
s
not
a
once
in
a
great
while
special
event
he
show
anyone
who
would
listen
how
his
new
approach
could
be
make
a
win
win
with
the
corporate
issuer
and
the
institutional
buyer
both
benefiting
by
work
together
and
develop
a
share
understand
fair
pricing
be
mandatory
and
that
be
fully
understood
by
both
side
both
the
corporation
and
the
institution
get
engage
that
be
the
secret
sauce
with
this
reconceptualization
of
the
underwriting
business
and
its
intensive
implementation
goldman
sachs
quickly
become
a
major
participant
in
more
underwritings
increase
its
share
of
each
underwriting
and
even
ran
several
major
underwritings
as
the
sole
distributor

multiply
note
dobkin
from
on
goldman

be
number
one
in
the
equity
underwriting
league
table
except
for
one
year
as
my
grandmother
always
say
it
s
not
a
perfect
world
develop
the
equity
capital
market
business
in
america
be
a
triumph
but
since
at
goldman

no
good
deed
go
unpunished
dobkin
have
to
re
create
his
stateside
success
in

start
in

in
the
early
s

to
privatize

and
make

the
bid
to
arrange
the

market
flotation
of
british
aerospace
british
telecom
and
british

unfortunately
for
kleinwort
benson
its
triumph
in
win
the
mandate
as
adviser
to
the
government
and
lead
underwriter
be
a
classic
pyrrhic
victory
one
it
really
could
not
afford
to
win
those
mandate
require
so
much
senior
level
time
to
execute
that
while
kleinwort
benson
get
the
prestige
and
the
gross
volume
they
tie
up
its
organization
so
much
that
it
could
not
compete
for
important
and
much
more
lucrative
corporate
merger
and
underwritings
as
a
result
kleinwort
benson
work
exceedingly
hard
for
little
profit
during
a
challenge
era
of
turbulent
change
in
the
city
of
london
when
every
merchant
bank
need
extra

to
retain
or
recruit
talented
banker
to
protect
its
traditional
corporate
clientele
preoccupy
with
early
privatization
like
british
telecom
kleinwort
benson
found
itself
unable
to
fend
off
recruitment
of
its
best
young
professional
particularly
by
the
more
aggressive
and
profit
focus
american
firm
like
goldman
sachs
hm
government
while
naturally
prefer
a
british
firm
take
the
broader
view
that
american
firm
might
offer
particular
comparative
advantage
in
fresh
idea
and
new
technique
craft
a
convincing

rehearse
the

to
perfection
know
how
to
organize
and
run
a
road
show
that
could
change
the
basis
on
which
the
enormous

be
do
sir
steve

at

and
sir
john

be
personally
interested
in
opening

if
not
break
up
the
close
knit
oligopoly
of
the
british

in
the

without
consider
other

hm
government
turn
to
morgan
stanley
the
british
government
s
traditional
north
american
banker
since
the
day
of
j
p
morgan
this
so
infuriate
eric
dobkin
at
goldman
sachs
that
he
resolve
to
engage
swiftly
and
vigorously
with
each
and
every
senior
hm
government
official
he
could
identify
then
goldman
sachs
get
lucky
very
lucky
and
morgan
stanley
could
not
have
be
more
helpful
to
goldman
sachs
british
telecom
s
privatization
get
badly
screw
up
start
with
the
morgan
stanley
syndicate
head
s
arrogantly
tell
the
british
government
that
morgan
stanley
absolutely
would
not
accept
the
united
kingdom
s
traditional
two
week
exposure
to
underwriting
risk
in
the
uk
most
stock
offering
be
do
by
well
establish
corporation
whose
share
have
long
be
list
on
the
london
stock
exchange
underwritings
of
common
stock
usually
percent
to
percent
increase
in
total

be
do
as
right
offering
with
most
of
the
share
take
up
by
institutional
investor
that
be
include
in
the
offering
syndicate
as
subunderwriters
when
they
agree
to
take
an
agree
amount
of
stock
at
an
agree
price
in
addition
the
underwriting
syndicate
s
offering
price
be
fix
on
impact
day
and
then
held
for
two
week
to
provide
enough
time
for
individual
retail
investor
to
read
the
full
page
newspaper
ad
offering
the
share
clip
the
order
form
at
the
bottom
of
the
page
and
mail
in
their
purchase
order
in
the
usual
uk
right
offering
this
leisurely
and
gentlemanly
way
of
raise
moderate
increment
of
equity
capital
have
be
satisfactory
for
both
issuer
and
investor
but
margaret
thatcher
s
enormous
privatization
be
different
radically
different
in
scale
and
in
structure
in
scale
privatization
be
huge
many
time
large
than
the
traditional
incremental
right
offering
and
be
initial
public
offering
in
a
market
with
few
ipo
as
ipo
they
have
no
price
history
and
no
establish
group
of
shareholder
this
meant
that
the
risk
involve
in
underwriting
and
hold
to
one
fix
price
for
two
long
week
be
much
great
than
the
risk
in
an
american
style
underwriting
where
the
whole
transaction
after
several
week
or
day
of
informal
prearrangement
be
formally
complete
in
a
few
minute
or
second
so
morgan
stanley
balk
and
the
bank
of
england
agree
to
take
percent
of
the
market
risk
by
underwriting
the
u
s
placement
and
thereby
guarantee
morgan
stanley
against
loss
then
everything
go
wrong
the
uk
underwriter
badly
misjudge
both
the
pricing
of
the
offering
and
the
aftermarket
demand
for
british
telecom
share
investor
demand
from
both
institution
and
individual
be
very
strong
a
particularly
insistent
demand
for
share
come
from
the
large
index
fund
because
the
financial
time
have
decide
to
include
british
telecom
in
its
widely
use
ftse
stock
exchange
index
know
as
footsie
on
the
day
of
the
offering
every
index
fund
felt
compel
to
buy
british
telecom
however
the
index
weight
of
british
telecom
be
calculate
as
if
percent
of
british
telecom
share
be
publicly
own
while
the
initial
offering
be
only
for
percent
of
british
telecom
share
as
a
result
supply
be
far
too
limited
to
meet
the
index
fund
requirement
so
the
stock
be
bid
up
in
price
an
astound
percent
on
the
first
day
that
be
bad
underwriting
in
the
uk
and
the
impact
in
the
united
state
be
bad
despite
the
british
government
s
policy
priority
of
establish
a
broad
retail
investor
base
morgan
stanley
sell
most
of
its
part
of
the
offering
to
a
few
favor
institutional
client
that
quickly
sell
the
stock
to
take
their
quick
profit
all
the

that
be
suppose
to
be
held
by
long
term

in
north
america
get
on
the
supersonic
concorde
and
flew
straight
back
to
london
even
before
the
ink
could
dry
to
meet
the
demand
of
the
index
fund
the
reflow
be
terrible
none
of
british
telecom
be
still
held
in
the
united
state
it
be
a
disaster
morgan
stanley
get
blame
in
the
press
this
make
it
politically
difficult
for
hm

to
select
morgan
stanley
for
the
next
big
privatization
that
s
when
dobkin

hi
eric
but
this
would
not
be
a
meeting
of

to
a

lead
underwriter
for
the
crucial
large
north
american
market
be
on
the
table
and
the
question
be
put
mr
dobkin
on
behalf
of
goldman
sachs
what
be
your
price
recommendation
dobkin
be
determine
not
only
to
win
the
north
american
mandate
for
british
gas
but
to
do
all
he
could
to
force
a
revolutionary
change
in
the
way
underwriting
be
traditionally
do
in
london
in
his
answer
dobkin
attack
establish
tradition
directly
on
every
front
if
british
firm
traditionally
kept
secret
which
institution
be
cooperate
as
subunderwriters
dobkin
would
show
all
his
card
and
promptly
pass
around
an
outsize
multipage
spreadsheet
listing
the
institutional
investor
down
the
left
hand
side
and
across
the
page
show
specific
data
for
each
institution
in
a
series
of
column
with
such
heading
as
total
asset
equity
asset
comparable
stock
own
price
acceptable
require
number
of
share
number
of
one
on
one
meeting
held
research
contact
and
so
on
total
disclosure
be
dobkin
s
objective
and
that
wasn
t
all
for
each
institution
if
you
care
to
know
more
we
have
in
the
large
binder
beside
me
a
complete
dossier
one
page
per
institution
on
our
firm
s
evaluation
of
each
aspect
of
that
institution
s
decision
make
on
british
gas
then
dobkin
ask
for
a
much
large
allocation
of
share
to
north
america
where
institution
aren
t
interested
in
hold
small
amount
of
a
stock
to
do
our
job
well
for
hm
treasury
we
ll
need
more
share
so
we
can
meet
the
real
demand
among
institutional
investor
in
the
u
s
so
they
will
get
enough
to
have
position
large
enough
to
keep
and
then
buy
more
then
he
turn
specifically
to
the
question
of
price
you
ask
what
be
our
recommendation
as
the
proper
offering
price
for
british
gas
in
our
judgment
anything
less
than
penny
would
be
wrong
for
her
majesty
s
government
and
wrong
for
the
british
people
anything
less
and
candidly
i
ll
be
personally
insult
because
both
the
crown
and
the
british
people
deserve
full
value
one
other
commitment
goldman
sachs
promise
it
will
buy
five
hundred
million
dollar
of
british
gas
share
up
to
a
price
of
penny

thank
you
mr

you
please
wait
utside

paper
look
slowly
around
the

all
the
gravity
he
could
muster
and
left
the
meeting
room
walk
with
as
much
formality
and
dignity
as
he
could
manage
and
sat
down
quietly
in
the
anteroom
after
half
an
hour
he
expect
some
sort
of
response
after
an
hour
he
be
unable
to
imagine
what
might
be
go
on
have

overstate
his
case
have
he
left
anything
out

make
equally
strong
presentation
could
any
firm
possibly
be
even
strong
after
two
hour
dobkin
s
sangfroid
be
give
way
to
real
concern
something
somehow
have
go

very
wrong
after
two
and
a
half
hour

the
british

business
during

the
american
underwriter
have
serious
argument
among
themselves
because
they
have
sharply
different
view
of

reputation
risk

they
didn
t
break
rank
in
public
in
meeting
on
friday
october
and
on
the
follow
monday
they
assert
that
the
week
s
market
trauma
be
exactly
what
the
force
majeure
provision
be
all
about
they
insist
that
the
enormous
sudden
drop
in
all
the
world
s
stock
market
be
indeed
a
force

event
that
clearly
justified
withdraw
the
offering
and
wait
for
well
and
more
normal
market
condition
the
collapse
of
world
market
be
certainly
a
major
force
unexpected
unmanageable
and
uninsurable
but
be
it
sufficient
to
declare
force
majeure
should
the
bp
underwriting
be
delayed
and
the
underwriter
absolve
of
their
obligation
and
their
sudden
loss
within
the
city
of
london
the
initial
consensus
be
that
the
bp
issue
should
not
be
reverse
and
the
city
firm
agree
to
take
their
loss
as
part
of
the
nature
of
the
business
and
to
protect
the
traditional
pricing
system
explain
sir
win
bischoff
chief
executive
of
schroders
we
thought
that
that
be
a
rational
business
decision
for
the
long
term
market
drop
even
very
large
one
be
not
part
of
the
understood
reason
for
force
majeure
so
at
first
the
british
underwriter
quietly
agree
to
carry
on
the
american
underwriter
goldman
sachs
morgan
stanley
salomon
brother
and
shearson
lehman
brother
saw
thing
differently
in
america
there
be
no
subunderwriters
these
four
firm
have
take
million
bp
share
onto
their
book
and
be
now
face
up
to
million
in
sudden
loss
for
each
of
them
the
loss
on
bp
would
be
the
large
loss
any
underwriter
anywhere
have
ever
experienced
while
the
american
claimed
the
right
to
call
the
whole
thing
off
the
force
majeure
escape
provision
could
only
be
trigger
by
a
claim
by
the
lead
domestic
british
underwriter
in
london
the
decision
center
on
clause
the
force
majeure
clause
that
explain
under
what
circumstance
underwriter
could
request
a
release
from
their
obligation
because
the
british
underwriter
be
so
numerous
and
the
percentage
they
have
underwritten
themselves
versus
passing
on
to
subunderwriters
be
relatively
small
their
individual
exposure
to
loss
be
much
small
than
the
american
typically
only
percent
as
large
so
some
of
the
british
firm
continued
to
feel
that
the
october
market
break
while
clearly
very
unusual
do
not
trigger
force
majeure
but
eventually
a
majority
of
the
twenty
two
major
uk
underwriter
vote
to
recommend
to
hm
treasury
that

should
be
declare
if
the
treasury
agree
the
underwriting
would
be
off
expose
to
much
large
loss
the
american
be
initially
unanimous
that
the
bp
underwriting
have
to
be
postpone
with
the
sudden
drop
off
in
share
price
swallow
the

cut
deeply
into

that
the

that
it

go
ahead
with

would
like
the

quite
clear
about
the

of
my
decision
first
and
most
important
to
allow
taxpayer
to
secure
the
full

of

they

not

it
be
not

bad
short
seller
could
sell

he
say
we
bought
it
and
we
own
it
he
knew
the

painful
he
also
knew
how
much
goldman
sachs
have
invest
in
the
past
few
year
to
establish
itself
in

that
it

cost
the

morale
to

the

at

with

still
in
the
first
year
of
its
major
strategic
drive
to
establish
a
strong
beachhead
in
london
the

each

it
would
take
far
too
long
to
become

important
opportunity
large
more
profitable
and
much
easy
to
exploit
be
in
america
and
on
and
on
besides
bp
prove
two
point
the
firm
would
never
lose
that
much
money
on
one
deal
in
north
america
and
goldman
sachs
be
clearly
be
stuffed
by
the
brit
who
refuse
to
invoke

the

argue
that
many
more
privatization
be
come
in
the
uk
and
in
several
other
country
and
that
american
concept
and
practice
in

be
sure
to
dominate
which
would
give
goldman
sachs
and
other
u
s
firm
important
competitive
advantage
as
always
the
question
be
ask
how
much
should
current
partner
spend
on
building
the
business
when
the
profit
if
there
ever
be
any
would
only
come
after
they
have
go
limited
so
they
would
enrich
only
future
partner
the
bp
offering
be
the
very
bad
experience
of
my
whole
career
say
partner
bob
conway
as
london
branch
manager
he
get
a
call
from
reuters
we
understand
on
good
authority
that
goldman
sachs
will
be
filing
for
protection
under
the
law
of
bankruptcy
would
you
care
to
comment
in
canada
the
bp
deal
have
blown
away
all
the
capital
of
wood
gundy
one
of
that
nation
s
lead
security
firm
and
force
it
to
merge
abruptly
with
a
major
commercial
bank
still
for
conway
explain
to
a
newspaper
reporter
who
thought
he
have
a
prize
win
scoop
that
the
rumor
of
bankruptcy
at
the
lead
u
s
firm
be
untrue
be
almost
easy
compare
to
go
around
to
each
and
every
bank
to
insist
that
goldman
sachs
be
financially
strong
every
night
he
recall
i
call
our
cfo
bob
friedman
in
new

to
review
the
detail
of
every

that
week
be
the
long
week
of
my
life
eric
dobkin
also
get
a
call
from
a
newspaper
reporter
you
will
know
this
be
a
very
sensitive
call
which
be
why
i
m
call
you
personally
i
have
it
on
very
good
authority
that
your
firm
have
take
a
major
loss
in
bp
share
and
that
goldman
sachs
may
be
in
serious
financial
difficulty
at
this
very
moment
can
you
verify
this
or
can
you
assure
me
that
it
be
not
true
dobkin
respond
i
have
not
spoken
to
new
york
for
three
hour
so
it
s
always
possible
that
something
have
go
wrong
that
i
don
t
know
about
but
i
very
much
doubt
it
yes
we
have
take
a
big
loss
on
bp
as
much
as
seventy
million
dollar
but
bp
be
not
our
only
position
our
large
position
be
not
in
stock
at
all
they
re
in
bond
where
we
ve
become
a
major
market
maker
and
price
of

have
go
up
a
lot
goldman
sachs
have
make
a
lot
more
money
in

during
the
past
day
than
it
have
lose
in

a
lot
more

create
an
opening

how
to
use
it
now
you
owe
me

come
from
who

who

they

to

for

five
billion

position
to
make
a

david

met
with

off

the

seem
impressed
but
give
no
indication
that
it
might
sell
both
side
agree
to
stay
in
touch
the
group
from
goldman
sachs
met
again
a
month
later
with
the

and
be
introduce
to
philip

of
schroders
which
be
advise
kio
on
various
matter
over
the
next
several
month
they
met
several
time
to
explore
various
alternative
to
maximize
kio
s
proceeds
but
no
specific
plan
be
ever
acknowledge
by
kio
the
kio
and
mallinckrodt
be
most
professional
recall
williams
they
give
away
nothing
but
be
completely
honest
in
what
they
do
say
pot
and
williams
have
many
discussion
over
the
next
several
month
they
agree
they
should
do
all
they
could
to
be
fully
prepared
because
they
knew
from
experience
that
very
big
trade
could
be
time
pressure
leave
too
little
time
to
get
approval
design
hedge
strategy
check
legal
question
and
develop
a
specific
strategy
for
resell
by
resolve
all
these
aspect
of
the
trade
well
in
advance
they
could
concentrate
on
make
the
right
bid
give
liquidity
risk
factor
and
current
market
condition
one
thing
they
would
not
do
talk
to
any
potential
buyer
or
even
to
anyone
who
would
be
talk
to
client
over
a
full
year
s
gestation
of
the
trade
there
be
zero
leak
from
goldman
sachs
but
there
be
occasional
hint
from
other
firm
so
williams
and
pot
grow
to
expect
that
if
they
ever
do
get
a
call
it
would
probably
be
in
competition
with
other
dealer
when
schroders
phone
on
may
williams
be
at
a
schedule
meeting
at
britain
s
financial
service
authority
a
colleague
get
a
call
on
his
cell
phone
from
williams
s
secretary
because
williams
didn
t
own
a
cell
phone
wiet
say
the
trade
be
on
and
want
to
know
how
soon
you
can
get
here
the
trade
would
be
two
billion
dollar
not
the
five
billion
dollar
originally
consider
but
still
by
far
the
large
ever
williams
excuse
himself
from
the
meeting
and
borrowing
the
cell
phone
go
look
for
a
cab
but
no
empty
cab
be
to
be
found
shortly
after
five
so
he
start
walk
in
what
he
hop
be
the
right
direction
he
call
pot
who
be
organize
a
conference
call
with
roy
zuckerberg
eric
dobkin
and
bob
steel
in
new
york
and
john
thain
in
london
silfen
have
retire
at
the
end
of
so
he
be
not
include
find
a
cab
at
last
williams
return
to
the
office
participate
in
the
transatlantic
phone
call
while
rid
through
the
city
williams
have
an
advantage
he
have
a
feel
for
how
trader
make
pricing
decision
in
blind
competition
because
of
his
experience
with
similar
trade
in
convertible
security
bp
share
have
close
in
london
at
the
group
settle
on
a
reoffering
price
the
price
at
which
goldman
sachs
would
offer
the
share
to
investor
if
it
won
the
bidding
of
a
discount
of
percent
williams
then
suggest
that
would
be
see
as
virtually
the
same
so
they
increase
it
to
then
williams
say
if
we
all
thought
penny
we
must
assume
our
competitor
will
too
if
it
s
the
natural
bid
would
be
but
experienced
dealer
know
not
to
bid
round
number
so
the
guy
who
ll
bid
will
add
a
tail
he
ll
actually
bid
or
maybe
to
be
really
clever
so
if
we
re
go
to
die
with
this
trade
let
s
go
down
in
flame
let
s
bid
so
we
won
t
be
edge
out
by
a
fraction
of
a
penny
dobkin
have
be
think
the
same
way
so
the
extra
tail
be
confirm
forty
minute
after
get
schroders

call
they
be
agree

nearly
an
hour
which
seem
a
very
long
time
ward
call
mallinckrodt
again
hop
to
gain
an
insight
into
what
might
be
happen
mallinckrodt
s
guard
response
pat
be
you
call
because
you
want
to
raise
your

a
few
minute
later

this
close

you

you
didn

goldman

collude
because
it
do
not
know
which
other
firm

bidding
the
next
high
bid
be
a
gap
of
less
than
one
tenth
of

on
two
billion

now
that
it
own
million
share
of
bp
worth
over
two
billion
dollar
goldman
sachs
do
practically
nothing
the
position
be
far
too
large
to
hedge
the
only
way
to
protect
against
market
risk
be
to
sell
well
that
s
why
the
firm
plan
to
tell
client
about
the
trade
only
after
the
p
m
close
of
nyse
trading
u
s
client
would
be
solicit
immediately
after
four
asian
client
would
be
contact
overnight
and
uk
and
european
client
would
be
approach
the
follow
morning
before
the
london
opening
the
carefully
developed
plan
take
a
detour
however
when
at
p
m
a
senior
partner
in
new
york
uncomfortable
with
the
market
risk
phone
pot
and
williams
and
propose
a
launch
as
soon
as
possible
say
that
some
of
the
decision
maker
at
big
u
s
client
would
be
leave
early
for
the
day
pot
and
williams
felt
they
have
to
follow
his
lead
so
they
do
it
might
have
be
possible
to
appeal
to
a
high
authority
but
williams
and
pot
limited
themselves
to
one
more
recitation
of
their
reason
when
that
brought
no
change
they
accepted
that
there
be
no
time
for
a
full
debate
now
they
have
a
problem
although
sale
to
client
would
be
an
off
board
non
nyse
distribution
regulation
require
that
when
client
be
solicit
prior
to
the

close
the
specialist

book
have
to
be
collapse
after
the
close
down
to
the
distribution
price
and
that
all
high
public
bid
have
to
be
fill
at
the
distribution
price
this
would
make
the
discount
look
less
attractive
furthermore
a
preclose
announcement
would
give
market
opportunist
the
chance
to
shoot
against
the
price
for
the
rest
of
the
trading
day
all
of
this
raise
the
risk
of
something
go
wrong

a
few
substantial
sale
be
execute
in
the
united
state
that
afternoon
and
even
and
the
balance
be
sell
to

the
next
morning
before
it
be

the

do
by
a

the

but
with
two
billion

at

seventeen
million

be
tiny

that
in

acknowledge
extracurricular
passion
be
fly
fishing
where
the
secret
for
success
be
learn
to
think
like
a
fish
as
several
partner
observe
rubin
and
friedman
have
be
insider
focus
on
a
series
of
specific
transaction
with
little
responsibility
for
develop
long
term
relationship
both
men
excel
at
find
creative
solution
to
hundred
of
individual
problem
but
like
most
of
their
predecessor
and
peer
at
other
firm
neither
have
need
to
develop
the
skill
of
building
consensus
across
large
group
skill
need
for
integrate
very
different
kind
of
business
and
different
group
of
people
into
a
coherent
organizational
strategy
still
the
two
men
differ
greatly
in
managerial
style
and
in
way
of
operating
as
they
prepared
to
take
the
lead
in
restructuring
the
bond
business
friedman
gather
up
more
than
a
yard
deep
pile
of
computer
printout
and
financial
report
and
dove
in
work
on
his
own
through
page
after
page
of
specific
often
make
careful
note
of
question
to
examine
with
extra
care
as
he
developed
factual
mastery
to
assure
himself
that
he
have
a
thorough
understand
of
every
aspect
of
the
bond
deal
business
then
he
would
cross
examine
the
unit
head
ask
as
always
lot
of
question
probe
more
and
more
deeply
to
develop
a
bottom
up
understand
in
contrast
rubin
invite
unit
leader
to
meet
with
him
and
explore
with
them
each
of
the
concept
and
business
model
that
seem
most
important
and
particularly
those
that
appear
to
be
gain
importance
so
he
could
understand
the
way
the
business
might
develop
and
where
the
firm
would
have
the
most
interest
challenge
and
opportunity
and
the
risk
in
each
case
as
a
result
of
his
learn
strategy
rubin
get
to
know
the
manager
as
individual
people
and
how
they
thought
and
understood
their
business
in
way
friedman
never
could
friedman
almost
instinctively
thought
in
the
term
of
a
wrestler
speed
agility
initiative
and
strength
be
important
characteristic
but
his
focus
be
on
defend
against
his
competitor
one
on
one
and
on
win
each
match
as
friedman
say
i
like
to
argue
vigorously
as
a
test
can
you
change
my
mind
rubin
be
in
a
different
arena
he
have
no
more
interest
in
win
a
discussion
than
in
win
at
frisbee
as
a
result
they
could
see
thing
differently
for
example
while
both
men
joked
about
have
to
wear
kneepads
because
on
behalf
of
one
area
of
the
firm
or
another
they
so
frequently
have
to
get
down
on
their
knee
in
apology
to
outrage
client
they
react
very
differently
on
the
day
that
a
distressed
partner
plead
this
be
a
major
client
and
the
guy
be
really
angry
and
he
s
demand
an
apology
at
least
an
apology
he
s
wrong
insist
friedman
and
we
know
we
re
right
there
s
no
need
to
genuflect
to
the
sob
no
matter
how
big
a
client
he
think
he
be
i

office
be
uptown
i
ll

by
this
afternoon
on
my
way
home
no
big
deal
when
rubin
get
to
the
client
s
office
it
be
clear
that
the
client
be
very
angry
and
he
say
so
in
no
uncertain
term
while
rubin
listen
for
emphasis
the
client
make
his
point
again
as
rubin
listen
the
client
continued
to
vent
his
frustration
as
rubin
listen
the
client
explain
why
he
felt
so
upset
as
rubin
continued
to
listen
the
client
say
he
hop
bob
understood
and
be
glad
he
be
listen
the
client
say
he

but

have
come
to
his
office
to
listen
the
client
hop
that
now
that
the
matter
be
out
in
the
open
now
that
there

a
realistic
understand

could
get
back

their
old
work
relationship

even
well
rubin
listen
and
the
client
say
he
really
appreciate
bob
s
deal
so
quickly
and
thoughtfully
with
a
situation
that
could
cause
some
people
to
overreact
and
blow
thing
out
of
proportion
rubin
continued
to
listen
a
little
later
as
rubin
listen
the
client
pause
and
then
reach
out

good
at
both

frank
could
i
see
you
for
a
minute
rubin
have
follow
partner
frank
brosens
out
of
a
management
committee
meeting
the
meeting
have
be
a
triumph
brosens
have
present
a
compelling
case
for
a
bold
commitment
to
arbitrage
japanese
equity
warrant
and
the
committee
have
strongly
agree
with
his
recommendation
brosens
have
make
the
entire
presentation
but
as
a
learn
experience
he
have
invite
zachary
kubrinick
to
sit
in
on
the
meeting
as
an
observer
brosens
knew
he
d
have
all
the
base
cover
and
all
the
fact
clearly
in
hand
but
he
could
hardly
believe
rubin
have
be
so
impressed
that
he
would
leave
the
meeting
to
compliment
him
immediately
brosens
be
right
rubin
be
not
rush
to
compliment
him
on
his
performance
frank
say
rubin
in
his

relaxed
voice
you
and

that
as
young
as
he
be
kubrinick
know
all
that
you
know
about
japanese
warrant
and
he
could
have
make
the
case
equally
well
you
really
should
have
let
him
make
the
case
and
get
the
experience
of
come
before
the
management
committee
by
not
take
the
credit
you
become
more
effective
if
you
do
right
by
people
they
win
and
you
win
frank
always
go
out
of
your
way
to
share
credit
bob

my
best
bos
ever
say
partner
tom

listen
to
you

to
get
a
full
understand
of
all
your
information
and
your
best
idea

clear
absolutely
clear
on
the

of
action
he
be
always
calm
incredibly
calm
and
never
fluster
or
put
off
by
market
or
by
the
sometimes
truly
outrageous
behavior
of
individual
which
never
ever
get
to
him
and
he
be
decisive
on
action
plan
rubin
s
response
to
everyone
who
ask
his
opinion

this
oblige
others
to
do
their
homework
and
offer
their
best
judgment
it
also
give
rubin
a
little
extra
time
for
thought
and
a
first
approximation
estimate
of
what
might
be
the
right
way
to
frame
the
question
or
understand
the
problem
whether
bob
agree
with
you
or
not
he
make
it
so
clear
that
he
really
understood
the
point
you
d
make
or
the
view
you
held
that
you
didn
t
feel
any
personal
loss
if
he
make
a
different
decision
because
you
knew
he
knew
all
you
knew
and
must
know
more
one
thing
rubin
do
not
do
be
change
a
well
reason
fact

annoyed
even
angry
with
anyone
who
want
to
reopen
a
discussion
he
thought
be
close
he
always
stayed
with
the

percent
of

the
firm

business
by
not
be
fully
competitive
as
a

and

the

of
longstanding

like
sears
roebuck

we
see
where
the
market
be
go
and
we
re
go
to

that
be
an
understatement
they

to
revolutionize
the
bond
business
and
change
everything
begin
with
the
business
concept

model
and
the
leadership
bob
rubin
and
steve
friedman
have
an
agenda
they
be
convince
just
as
convince
as
the
two
john
have
be
during
their
sandwich
lunch
at
scottie
s
that
goldman
sachs
have
to
change
the
firm
could
prosper
as
a
small
boutique
or
as
a
large
multifaceted
organization
but
it
could
not
succeed
for
long
as
a
midsize
firm
stuck
in
the
muddle
in
the
middle
which
be
where
they
thought
it
be
as
they
point
out
it
be
already
too
late
to
choose
the
boutique
option
the
strategic
imperative
therefore
be
to
expand
in
service
and
product
and
particularly
in
market
by
go
international
they
want
change
both
in
course
direction
and
in
pace
of
process
and
they
want
to
move
away
from
limit
the
firm
to
whitehead

and
weinberg
s
focus
on

particularly
from
large
international
rival
and
embolden
commercial
bank
use

more
aggressively
take
more

this
meant
the
firm
risk
be
relative
to
the
best
competitor
too
slow
too
siloed
and
too
cautious
about
new
idea
and
new
business
they
believe
that
the
firm
s
every
tub

goldman
sachs
as
a

less
effective
than
it
could
and
should
be
they
worried
about
the
implicitly
cautious
incrementalism
of
be

fast
follower
and
not
always
be
even
that
they
argue
that
the

of

the

have
accelerate
so
significantly
that
in
addition
to
be
fast
follower
the
firm
have
to
be
more
creative
more
aggressive
and
well
coordinate
as
friedman
say
if
we
re
not

in

we
won

to
reap
the
really
good

that
the

be
need
to
identify
new
business
opportunity
like
seller
rep
and
tender
defense
early
so
the
firm
could
get
out
ahead
of
the
competition
the
first
step
toward
firmwide
cooperation
be
for
the
individual
departmental
baron
to
give
up
their
customary
focus
on
what
be
best
for
their

i
give
bob
a
lot
of
credit
for
self
denial
say
friedman
over
and
over
again
when
we
discuss
how
to
play
particular
takeover
battle
he
always
come
down
on
the
side
of
what
s
best
for
the

never
on
what
s
best
for

or
for
him
personally
he
couldn
t
have
be
more
partnerlike
to
rubin
and
friedman
even
goldman
sachs
s
traditionally
great
strength
in
nurture
client
relationship
could
be
use
as
an
excuse
for
not
innovate
which
could
hold
the
firm
back
from
be
fully
competitive
too
many
people
particularly
senior
people
be
reluctant
to
upset
old

they
saw
it
tarnish
the

and
all
the

this
be
the
origin
of
the

of

a

act
as

to
a
formidable

i
get
caught
up
in
a
mission
to
fix
the
place
recall
friedman
the
firm
be
seriously
underperform
so
it
be
clear
that
there
be
an
awful
lot
of
work
to
do
but
i
never
have
a
focus
on
become
manage

the

rubin
and
friedman
be
right
about
the
risk
that
be
wisely
conservative
can
deteriorate
into
defensive
caution
and
about
the
importance
of
the

become
more
aggressive
john

have
see
it
and
it
be
an
important
factor
in

to

the

be
that
the

he
have
no
major
outside
interest

almost
no

outside
his

so
weinberg
be
understandably
in
no
hurry
to
leave
his
beloved

or
his
position
as
its

prove

to

many
major

this
would
take

there
be
plenty
of

them
to
do
in

meanwhile
as
they
get
some

weinberg
be
still
lead
the

in
its
fast
change
business
and
make

strategic
decision

decision
not
to
do
the

havoc
at

while
many
of

s
decision
be
wisely
conservative
as

some
later
appear

conservative

weinberg
be
traditionally
disdainful
of

in

later
call
high

bond
he
be
understandably
slow
to
recognize
the
rapid
change
in
the
debt
capital
market
and
in
corporate
finance
that

in
their
continuous
search
for
high

yield
for
their
well
diversified
bond
portfolio
weinberg
believe
that
ensure
orderly
leadership
succession
would
be
an
important
capstone
for
his
career
he
thought
he
have
it
all
work
out
and
be
proudly
bring
along
his
heir
at
what
he
saw
as
the
right
pace
school
them
to
be
co
leader
when
he
announce
in
early
august
that
rubin
and
friedman
would
co
head
fix
income
from
december
weinberg
say
they
be
very
capable
very
talented
people
but
we
have
a
lot
of
talented
guy
around
here
weinberg
be
not
ready
to
retire
and
not
nearly
ready
to
anoint
successor
despite
the
widely
held
expectation
that
rubin
and
friedman
would
eventually
be
chosen
rubin
have
be
with
the
firm
for
nineteen
year
and
friedman
for
twenty
weinberg
continued
with
his
deliberately
restrain
praise
steve
and
bob
have
not
be
in
the
fix
income
business
but
they
be
good
organizer
and
will
be
there
long
enough
to
give
the
talent
we
have
in
that
division
some
time
to
grow
so
future
leader
could
come
from
within
the
division
weinberg
saw
the
announcement
as
a
clear
step
in
his
long
term
plan
to
bring
them
along
and
be
proud
of
have
give
them
more
and
more
authority
over
the
precede
five
year
in
a
progression
transition
that
affirm
the
special
quality
of
goldman
sachs
s
thoughtfully
plan
leadership
but
rubin
and
friedman
saw
it
differently
they
believe
that
as
an
intermediary
in
an
intensely
competitive
market
goldman
sachs
would
need
to
expand
the
range
of
service
provide
and
establish
leadership
in
major
regional
market
around
the
world
as
the
market
globalize
as
goldman
sachs
expand
it
would
simultaneously
move
in
stage
up
the
economic
and
profitability
ladder
from
agency
broker
to
underwriter
and
dealer
to
manage
agent
to
manage
partner
to
independent
capital
strong
risk
embrace
principal
the
ceiling
of
one
stage
become
the
floor
for
the
next
stage
as
leader
rubin
and
friedman
be
determine
to
provide
the
conceptual
framework
and
they
stimulate
and
reward
entrepreneurial
leadership
to
increase
the
organizational
drive
that
would
make
serial
transformation
possible
john
weinberg
be
not
much
interested
in
strategy
and
planning
explains
john
whitehead
so
steve
friedman
and
bob
rubin
inherit
the
budgeting
and
planning
side
of
the
business
and
run
the
firm
on
a
day
to
day
basis
nobody
chose
us
or
assign
us
to
take
over
the
bond
business
say
friedman
somehow
misremember
john
weinberg
s
key
role
no
one
appoint
us
we
be
really
self
appoint
as
we
work
at
solve
problem
nobody
chose
us
to
lead
the
firm
we
just
lead
we
could
see
the
job
that
need
to
be
do
so
we
just
do
it
we
be
de
facto
coo
of
goldman
sachs
several
year
before
we
get
those
official
letter
and
bob
and
i
become
co
head
of
the
firm
by
self
selection
for
the
bond
business
we
just
start
march
to
the
sound
of
the
gun
and
improvise
as
we
go
along
while
we
be
never
thwart
and
want
to
be
sure
we
understood
everyone
s
opinion
and
perspective
it
take
way
too
long
to
get
action
particularly
when
we
sometimes
have
to
go
back
over
everything
to
include
in
the
loop
all
the
other
people
john
weinberg
felt
should
get
a
hearing
rubin
and
friedman
be
convince
of
a
need
for
radical
organizational
and
strategic
change
but
weinberg
be
not
so
sure
particularly
as
he
saw
other
firm
absorb
large
loss
on
imperative
innovation
every
fully
developed
organization
be
hardwired
and
it
s
a
challenge
to
rewire
that
organization
to
recruit
and
train
people
who
be
really
different
particularly
if
the
objective
be
to
make
the
new
organization
both
different
and
well
do
that
implies
upgrade
the
quality
of
the
people
already
in
place
friedman
and
rubin
have
no
time
for
patient
gradualism
they
want
major
change
now
particularly
in
fix
income
abrupt
change
transfer
and
demotion
be
new
to
goldman
sachs
so
it
be
strike
to
many
when
two
senior
partner
be
abruptly
transfer
eric
sheinberg
a
fourteen
year
partner
be
switch
out
of
his
position
as
head
of
corporate
bond
and
soon
link
up
with
robert
maxwell
in
london
and
john
d
gilliam
a
twelve
year
partner
who
head
corporate
underwriting
have
his
position
take
by
two
year
partner
nelson
abanto
sheinberg
be
shock
and
say
only
i
would
rather
not
comment
others
thought
it
s
about
time
as
friedman
put
it
what
s
so
fair
about
keep
tire
old
partner
when
that
mean
block
the
best
young
people
and
violate
our
commitment
to
meritocracy
when
the
firm
won
business
by
bidding
too
boldly
against
salomon
brother
and
have
to
carry
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
in
unsold
inventory
gilliam
observe
sardonically
history
tell
you
that
we
be
too
aggressive
an
unrepentant
abanto
would
say
i
plead
guilty
to
be
aggressive
as
rubin
and
friedman
have
intend
the
firm
s
concept
of
the
bond
business
soon
change
from
risk
avoid
minimal
use
of
capital
and
extensive
customer
service
to
boldly
risk
the
firm
s
own
capital
to
make
much
large
profit
revolutionize
the
bond
business
be
match
with
important
internal
change
for
example
the
back
office
be
not
up
to
date
and
not
well
integrate
into
the
firm
s
operation
information
technology
would
get
a
request
for
a
new
subsystem
go
work
on
it
for
a
year
and
come
back
only
to
be
told
we
can
t
use
that
our
business
have
change
we
don
t
do
our
business
the
same
way
anymore
friedman
take
the
lead
in
rationalize
the
firm
s
enormous
expenditure
in
it
nearly
five
hundred
million
dollar
a
year
he
start
by
interview
a
lot
of
it
manager
about
management
and
quickly
conclude
it
be
pretty
obvious
and
take
no
great
genius
to
recognize
that
it
have
to
be
integrate
directly
into
operation
and
that
goldman
sachs
need
to
work
out
the
cost
versus
value
right
at
the
line
manager
level
so
that
when
a
manager
decide
what
value
he
want
that
automatically
meant
the
cost
be
his
too
friedman
take
responsibility
for
deal
with
complaint
provoke
by
the
incentive
compensation
system
he
and
rubin
have
inherit
in
fix
income
and
be
determine
to
make
more
effective
as
a
way
of
make
the
unit
more
competitive
bond
salesman
could
when
they
get
everything
right
make
a
lot
of
money
compare
to
investment
banker
so
some
banker
go
to
friedman
to
complain
they
get
this
response
yes
the
bond
salesman
make
more
money
than
you
do
and
some
make
a
lot
more
that
s
because
of
two
thing
first
they
re
very
talented
in
their
work
and
they
work
very
hard
second
and
this
may
be
far
more
important
to
you
they
be
on
a
different
career
path
with
very
different
prospect
of
ever
become
a
partner
so
don
t
bitch
to
me
unless
you
really
think
bond
salesman
have
a
well
overall
career

if
after
serious
consideration
you
really

theirs
be
well
let
me
know
and
i
ll
arrange
an
interview
in
bond

for
you
right
away
complaint
vaporize
friedman
and
rubin
press
weinberg
more
and
more
explicitly
to
turn
the
firm
leadership
over
to
them
but
weinberg
start
think
he
might
stay
on
a
while
longer
as
senior
partner
agree
that
they
would
have
to
force
the
issue
of
weinberg
s
passing
the
baton
rubin
and
friedman
go
to
see
him
i
told
him
then
and
there
recall
friedman
that
if
he
be
think
of
make
a
decision
to
stay
he
have
to
know
he
d
also
be
decide
that
it
be
time
for
me
to
go
because
i
d
always
say
i
want
to
retire
young
enough
to
have
a
second
career
i
wouldn
t
wait
around
until
he
be
seventy
and
then
take
over
the
leadership
for
another
ten
year
after
that
that
would
be
take
up
too
much
of
my
time
in
december
rubin
and
friedman
officially
become
co
senior
partner
and
co
ceo
and
weinberg
become
senior
chairman
and
continued
work
on
megadeals
for
major
client
rubin
and
friedman
would
serve
as
co
ceo
for
just
three
year
they
press
ahead
with
organizational
change
that
match
their
strategy
departmental
silo
have
to
be
remove
and
different
unit
of
the
firm
much
more
fully
coordinate
and
integrate
the
departmental
baron
independence
have
to
be
reduce
in
favor
of
a
firm
first
orientation
with
far
more
accountability
both
for
planning
and
for
the
result
produce
it
s
easy
to
have
a
strong
consistent
culture
when
only
a
few
people
be
involve
and
they
all
grow
up
in
the
same
business
with
the
same
objective
same
standard
and
same
economic
interest
say
friedman
as
the
firm
grow
in
number
of
people
and
particularly
in
variety
of
allegiance
experience
and
priority
the
whole
concept
of
teamwork
become
more
and
more
important
and
more
and
more
challenge
to
accelerate
the
dynamism
of
the
firm
a
change
they
believe
necessary
rubin
and
friedman
identify
talented
people
who
be
impatient
for
constructive
change
and
promote
them
into
key
position
where
their
demonstrate
talent
and
impatience
would
help
pick
up
the
pace
in
their
whole
unit
to
preclude
too
easy
acceptance
of
their
idea
friedman
and
rubin
insist
on
talk
it
all
out
and
promote
debate
ask
the
junior
people
to
speak
first
so
they
would
not
be
dispute
their
senior
and
so
senior
would
have
the
insight
of
young
people
before
express
their
own
view
they
also
believe
that
full
and
open
discussion
would
result
in
strong
commitment
to
what
be
decide
they
intend
to
lead
direct
and
control
through
the
management
committee
and
to
lead
that
powerful
committee
by
consistently
think
through
and
agree
on
decision
in
advance
which
meant
they
be
take
and
hold
the
initiative
they
would
get
together
and
work
their
way
through
each
complex
problem
on
each
meeting
s
agenda
clarify
the
essence
of
an
idea
or
decision
and
then
try
to
develop
the
best
strategy
and
the
most
effective
implementation
we
would
work
out
our
agreement
in
private
and
then
take
them
forward
recall
friedman
if
either
of
us
felt
strongly
about
any
decision
we
would
defer
to
that
strong
view
if
we
both
felt
equally
strongly
about
something
we
would
take
the
more
conservative
way
bob
and
i
never
have
an
argument
i
do
not
recall
ever
be
upset
with
bob
we
be
always
ask
one
core
question
how
can
we
advance
what
s
best
for
the
firm
and
make
more
money
at
the
same
time
recognize
that
all

have
useful
information
and
insight
to
contribute
even
though
not
all
be
equally
valuable
they
work
hard
at
make
the
committee
a
forum
for
discussion
and
decision
not
merely
approval
however
while
friedman
and
rubin
believe
that
they
never
push
thing
through
and
always
thought
others
have
useful
insight
and
that
discussion
flush
out
all
the
key
variable
other

begin
to
feel
that
they
really
brought
issue
to
the
committee
just
for
ratification
friedman
and
rubin

determine
to
raise
the
bar
if
a
presenter
be
take
too
long
or
repeat
himself
he
d
be
cut
off
with
a
comment
like
we
heard
you
the
first
three
time
you
make
that
same
point
the
rigorous
question
of
division
head

see
as
a
radical
change
from
john

s
open
laissez
faire

and
empower
the

in
the

and
in

geographic

some
participant
felt
it
be
not
the
right
process
in
a
true
partnership
rubin
and
friedman
would
signal
their
discipline

presentation
assume
always
that
we
have
all
read
your
memo

recommendation
with
care
this
put
some
investment
banker
off
their
usual
game
plan
of
start
every
discussion
with
crisp
energize
presentation
that
would
frame
the
decision
and
dominate
the
meeting

factor
brain
recall
bob

they
always
go
with
the

but
this
focus
on
brainpower
be
not
always
the
right
way
to
go
as
another
partner
recall
steve
and
bob
be
so
rational
they
ignore
some
of
those
human

that
be
also
very
important
the
intellectual
rigor
of
the
meeting
increase
and
then
increase
again
as
friedman

for
what
friedman

only
the
really
hard

go
to

half

the

would
be
dangerously
part
of
the
problem
while
friedman
and
rubin
felt
frustrate
by
what
they
thought
be
slowness
on
strategic
decision
their
drive
to
break
siloed
separation

help
internal

within
the

to

commitment
to
both
send

for

widely
the

that
the

even

a

with
each

like

they
be
determine
to
prevent
the
obvious
problem
of
have
people
play
one
of
them
off
against
the
other
so
they
set
out
a
clear
policy
if
you
talk
to
one
of
us
you
ve
talk
to
both
of
us
it
s
our
job
to
keep
each
other
fully
up
to
date
a
late
night
policy
question
to
one
of
them
might
be
answer
with
a
specific
decision
early
the
next
morning
by
the
other
as
friedman
recall
we
didn
t
want
any
chance
of
anyone
get
one
inch
of
water
in
between
us
we
be
tenacious
because
we
have
to
be
but
i
felt
badly
when
people
thought
we
be
too
aggressive
and
call
us
the
doberman
pinscher
as
manage
partner
rubin
and
friedman
have
to
be
actively
engage
in
the
firm
s
major
client
relationship
globally
and
have
to
understand
the
market
risk
be
take
worldwide
so
both
have
huge
travel
obligation
and
each
have
key
client
to
cover
we
adopt
an
effective
one
here
one
travel
coordination
recognize
that
when
two
people
coordinate
and
focus
their
impact
on
an
organization
can
be
truly
formidable
explains
friedman
he
then
smile
as
he
add
mischievously
we
split
country
and
client
coverage
as
evenly
as
possible
bob
get
moscow
so
to
be
entirely
fair
i
graciously
take
paris
rubin
and
friedman
want
to
differentiate
goldman
sachs
in
the
breadth
and
intensity
of
service
receive
by
the
firm
s
client
and
prospective
client
so
they
drove
for
a
superior
level
of
coordination
across
the
whole
firm
through
degree
personal
performance
review
base
on
evaluation
collect
on
each
person
by
everyone
he
work
with
in
and
out
of
his
department
they
also
establish
cross
rough
review
in
which
people
be
evaluate
by
manager
from
other
unit
to
ensure
consistent
firmwide
objectivity
with
three
sixty
review
everyone
knew
they
have
a
real
say
in
one
another
s
evaluation
and
that
everything
be
put
out
in
the
open
twice
each
year
recall
friedman
everyone
be
taught
to
play
to
their
strength
and
not
to
expose
the
firm
to
their
weakness
take
control
of
performance
appraisal
and
compensation
which
traditionally
have
be
left
to
the
different

important
to
rubin
and
friedman
centralization
facilitate
consistency
reward
firmwide
teamwork
and
reduce
the
power
of
the
divisional
baron
as
friedman
recall
we
need
control
of
the
personnel
review
process
to
drive
cooperation
through
friedman
believe
there
should
be
much
more
differentiation
in
compensation
to
achieve
more
discipline
and
accountability
and
more
control
by
the
firm
as
a
whole
rather
than
by
the
separate
division
explains
friedman
on
compensation
the
firm
have
become
more
interested
in
maximize
social
harmony
than
in
rigorous
evaluation
so
actual
payouts
to
individual
be
closer
than
might
be
expect
and
they
be
converge
as
friedman
identify
one
source
of
the
problem
if
a
reviewer
have
fifty

to
do
which
be
not
unusual
it
be
awfully
hard
not

get
the
task
out
of
the
way
even
though
people

be
at

but
this
be
not
fair
to
the

of
the

we
owe
them
accurate
feedback
friedman

rubin
be
prepared
to
force
objective
discrimination
to
prevent
cronyism
every

valuable

advantage

get
the

launch
principal

it
be
a

to
get
the

to
make

from

like
we
don

work
to
support
other

and
go

tempt

resign
from

to
do

yes

they

get

to
it

then
he
get

okay

he
say
for
four
million
we
bought
a
small
paper
business
from
the
rockefeller
at
least
it
get
us
start
as
friedman
recall
for
private

the
ultimate
key
be
to
get
hank

a

banker
and
co
head

p

if
we
be
okay
on
our
skill

and
we
have
the
best
deal
flow
we
would
have
a
clear
competitive
edge
overall
but
we
need
the
superior
deal
flow
that
could
only
come
from
our
many
corporate
client
and
that
meant
we
need
the
ibs
guy
out
there
work
for
us
once
we
get
the
system
go
properly
it
be
clear
that
we
would
often
be
the
prefer
investor
friedman
get
little
active
support
and
considerable
resistance
for
his
private

initiative
confirm
his
observation
that
it
s
harder
to

it

with

that

three
year
later
understandably
enthusiasm
for
private

increase
as
his
interest
in
real

lead
him
to
study
the
drive
factor
in
that
business
friedman
be
told
by
the
firm
s
expert
in
real
estate
that
the
key
to
success
with
an
important
office
building
be
get
the
prime
tenant
as
a
major
firm
with
a
large
number
of
employee
lot
of
equipment
special
spatial
need
like
a
large
trading
floor
plus
attractive
space
to
accommodate
numerous
visitor
goldman
sachs
be
clearly
a
prime
tenant
friedman
recall
so
why
give
that
economic
advantage
to
a
developer
when
we
could
instead
keep
it
and
use
it
ourselves
since
we
knew
we
could
deliver
the
prime
tenant
ourselves
we
should
own
our
own
building
this
think
be
behind
the
firm
s
act
on
a
recommendation
by
george
doty
that
it
buy
and
complete
the
large
headquarters
at
broad
street
be
construct
by
a
columbus
ohio
developer
upon
completion
it
be
sell
as
a
fully
rent
building
to
metlife
and
then
lease
back
for
the
firm
s
use
on
term
that
give
goldman
sachs
percent
control
of
all
operating
decision
plus
a
tidy
profit
in
the
early
ninety
the
firm
also
take
a
hard
look
at
canary
wharf
in
london
commercial
property
lease
in
london
be
traditionally
long
term
and
marked
to
market
every
five
year
the
only
way
out
of
risk
these
escalation
be
to
buy
a
building
as
the
manage
partner
charge
with
all
sort
of
administrative
responsibility
fred
krimendahl
bid
but
be
outbid
on
two
city
property
then
the
daily
telegraph
move
its
huge
printing
press
to
the
london
docklands
and
its
cavernous
building
on

street
become
available
during
christmas
week
if
a
deal
could
be
close
by
year
end
the
vacate
space
be
ideal
for
construct
a
major
new
office
building
in
a
fine
location
now
know
worldwide
as
peterborough
court
krimendahl
quickly
organize
a
channel
island
company
for
tax
reason
and
bought
the
property
only
to
be
criticize
for
not
clearing
it
with
the
management
committee
the
move
be
a
great
success
the
alternative
remain
unattractive
as
friedman
recall
i
could
see
that
by
canary
wharf
would
be
a
superb
property
but
back
at
the
time
of
decision
there
be
way
too
many
problem
none
of
the
store
or
apartment
you
see
now
be
there
transportation
be
awful
the
location
be
completely
unfamiliar
it
take
too
long
to
get
there
because
the
tube
and
light
rail
line
be
not
yet
instal
and
as
a
partnership
rather
than
a
corporation
we
d
have
have
all
sort
of
significant
tax
problem
so
we
pass
on
that
particular
project
however
the
commitment
to
capital
investment
and
not
just
in
building
be
gain
momentum
at
goldman
sachs
bob
rubin
saw
numerous
opportunity
to
commit
capital
in
high
profit
principal
trading
and
knew
that
since
the
great
risk
in
trading
be
time
trader
must
have
long
term
patient
capital
that
can
wait
for
result
as
keynes
observe
market
can
stay
wrong
longer
than
a
dealer
can
stay
liquid
cause
gambler
s
ruin
if
the
firm
be
to
pursue
its
most
profitable
principal
trading
opportunity
goldman
sachs
would
have
to
accept
abrupt
irregular
gain
and
loss
and
would
need
very
patient
capital
as
a
principal
investor
few
other
financial
organization
in
the
world
have
so
much
go
for
them
the
firm
s
network
of
agency
relationship
be
a
powerful
advantage
but
one
big
ingredient
be
wrong
for
principal
invest
and
acquisition
goldman
sachs
s
partnership
economics
great
investment
could
take
many
year
to
mature
fully
but
partnership
accounting
measure
everything
annually
the
risk
on
a
principal
investment
would
usually
concentrate
during
the
early
year
but
the
payoff
would
usually
come
in
later
year
off
cycle
with
a
partnership
one
solution
to
this
mismatch
would
have
be
to
use
date
account
under
which
the
partner
who
make
the
investment
would
reap
the
return
no
matter
when
they
come
but
that
approach
wasn
t
friedman
and
rubin
s
both
be
skillful
and
experienced
defensive
player
watchful
to
identify
risk
and
uncertainty
and
to
protect
against
them
the
combination
of
more
capital
commitment
and
the
need
for
more
liquidity
be
a
straightforward
management
problem
to
friedman
and
rubin
and
there
be
a
well
solution
public
ownership
originally
suggest
long
before

john
weinberg
have
be
ready
to
explore
the
question
for
goldman
sachs
but
make
no
explicit
commitment
do
you
think
i
want
to
go
public
not
me
weinberg
and
others
spent
year
of
off
site
meeting
ponder
an
ipo
and
how
to
maintain
the
spirit
of
the
partnership
and
friedman
and
rubin
have
quickly
champion
the
idea
in
december
they
have
make
their
ill
fat
presentation
to
the
partner
on
behalf
of
a
unanimous
management
committee
of
a
proposal
to
take
goldman
sachs
public
at
the
saturday
morning
meeting
rubin
and
friedman
who
be
already
widely
accepted
as
the
next
generation
of
leader
give
their
vision
of
the
future
opportunity
that
be
opening
up
for
the
firm
as
a
trading
powerhouse
and
as
a
private
equity
investor
and
why
an
important
pathway
to
become
that
high
profit
firm
be
public
ownership
look
back
those
who
be
there
say
the
saturday
morning
presentation
be
not
successful
because
it
be
surprisingly
weak
and
amateurish
an
important
problem
be
that
almost
no
time
have
be
give
in
advance
to
prepare
the
partner
think
about
an
ipo
so
the
partner
have
not
thought
enough
about
the
complex
subject
or
its
many
implication
to
agree
to
such
a
major
organizational
and
cultural
change
the
partnership
have
always
be
consider
almost
sacred
to
the
people
and
especially
the
partner
of
goldman
sachs
most
have
assume
the
firm
would
forever
be
a
private
partnership
and
most
believe
the
partnership
have
be
and
would
always
be
the
vital
engine
of
the
firm
s
continue
success
everyone
could
see
that
an
ipo
would
make
senior
partner
suddenly
wealthy
but
it
be
also
clear
to
the
thirty
seven
new
partner
twice
as
many
as
in
any
prior
class
who
have
become
partner
only
one
week
before
that
they
would
be
frozen
at
small
percentage
get
only
a
very
small
part
of
the
wealth
they
could
expect
to
accumulate
over
the
next
ten
or
fifteen
year
as
active
partner
rubin
give
his
cautious
outlook
for
the
business
have
actually
thought
even
the
new
partner
would
be
well
off
with
an
ipo
senior
partner
tend
to
be
in
favor
but
be
silent
various
group
raise
question
some
express
concern
about
the
loss
of
privacy
regard
their
accumulate
wealth
investment
banker
have
no
need
in
their
business
for
large
amount
of
permanent
capital
and
be
unenthusiastic
about
make
major
capital
commitment
to
support
trading
as
the
meeting
continued
partner
spoke
with
increasingly
strong
feeling
and
sometimes
in
loud
voice
even
with
tear
about
the
risk
of
lose
the
spiritual
value
of
a
partnership
that
have
be
nurture
for
many
year
by
their
predecessor
and
that
would
they
hop
be
strengthen
and
pass
on
to
worthy
successor
resistance
be
so
strong
that
it
be
back
to
the
draw
board
for
an
ipo
but
both
rubin
and
friedman
be
determine
to
change
goldman
sachs
in
structure
strategy
operation
incentive
and
control
and
to
commit
to
international
expansion
embrace
risk
use
technology
increase
discipline
and
deploy
capital
perhaps
symbolically
john
weinberg
have
take
a
seat
on
the
dais
somewhat
physically
separate
from
the
management
committee
and
express
no
support
for
the
proposal
even
though
partner
in
the
audience
knew
that
his
share
in
a
public
offering
would
be
worth
well
over
one
hundred
million
dollar
no
decision
be
make
on
saturday
and
the
traditional
partner
dinner
dance
be
held
that
night
at
sotheby
s
sunday
morning
before
the
meeting
reconvene
the
new
partner
gather
together
they
could
if
they
agree
vote
as
a
block
of
thirty
seven
then
steve
friedman
arrive
he
be
angry
and
insist
there
be
no
block
voting
by
any
interest
group
everyone
should
think
for
and
vote
for
the
firm
as
a
whole
you
don
t
have
to
be
mother
teresa
but
vote
individually
with
only
half
be
what
s
right
for
you
and
at
least
half
what
s
best
for
goldman
sachs
the
new
partner
be
daunt
they
knew
friedman
be
strongly
in
favor
of
an
ipo
and
they
all
knew
that
future
change
in
their
partnership
percentage
would
be
make
by
the
management
committee
jim
weinberg
who
for
many
year
head
up
ibs
and
provide
invaluable
informal
counsel
to
his
young
brother
john
rise
to
speak
for
faithful
stewardship
and
the
partner
responsibility
to
the
next
generation
in
his
view
the
proposal
just
didn
t
make
any
sense
the
heritage
that
have
be
entrust
to
the
current
partner
as
steward
brought
with
it
a
responsibility
to
make
the
firm
strong
and
pas
it
on
to
the
next
generation
besides
he
have
no
interest
in
reading
in
the
newspaper
about
partner
earnings
this
signal
for
many
that
john
be
not
really
in
favor
of
an
ipo
as
jim
weinberg
often
do
he
have
caught
the
consensus
of
the
partnership
no
vote
be
take
or
need
some
believe
that
with
the
consensus
not
to
go
public
the
traditional
value
of
the
partnership
be
reaffirm
and
the
partner
be
rededicate
to
building
the
firm
some
believe
the
business
strategy
of
go
global
be
agree
others
worried
that
the
genie
of
greed
be
out
of
the
bottle
for
many
the
infusion
of
equity
capital
from
sumitomo
show
that
an
ipo
be
not
necessary
to
obtain
the
capital
need
for
a
strategy
of
growth
and
expansion
abroad
it
didn
t
really
matter
the
partner
of
goldman
sachs
be
not
psychologically
ready
to
be
a
public
company
after
the
silent
decision
not
to
go
public
become
clear
to
all
bob
rubin
spoke
to
the
whole
firm
as
partner
in
this
firm
we
be
not
the
owner
of
the
firm
we
be
closer
to
be
fiduciary
and
caretaker
of
the
culture
we
really
believe
we
don
t
have
the
right
to
sell
goldman
sachs
on
december
an
impromptu
meeting
of
the
available
partner
be
call
via
e
mail
and
held
on
the
thirtieth
floor
of
broad
street
the
partner
of
goldman
sachs
have
expect
five
or
ten
year
under
rubin
and
friedman
nobody
have
expect
bill
clinton
to
win
the
presidency
ten
day
before
warren
christopher
soon
to
be
name
secretary
of
state
have
call
rubin
sound
him
out
about
become
secretary
of
the
treasury
but
rubin
say
he
be
too
new
to
washington
and
felt
that
lloyd
bentsen
be
the
best
candidate
for
treasury
because
he
have
the
right
experience
then
christopher
and
others
press
rubin
to
take
a
new
economic
policy
coordinate
job
at
the
white
house
can
i
talk
to
people
outside
the
government
to
get
their
judgment
can
you
give
me
an
example
well
i
d
always
want
to
get
steve
friedman
s
thought
after
a
long
meeting
in
arkansas
rubin
who
have
not
expect
to
go
to
dc
and
have
not
know
clinton
well
would
be
go
to
washington
when
he
return
to
new
york
early
the
next
day
he
go
directly
to
goldman
sachs
to
meet
with
his
partner
and
tell
them
of
his
plan
he
be
obviously
tire
and
hungry
on
the
plane
from
little
rock
to
new
york
he
d
make
some
note
of
what
to
say
and
he
spoke
to
the
group
as
he
ate
some
breakfast
he
talk
informally
and
emotionally
about
how
much
he
treasure
his
experience
and
his
friendship
at
goldman
sachs
but
it
be
clear
to
his
partner
that
he
be
already
relocate
his
personal
center
of
gravity
to
washington
steve
friedman
would
now
be
alone
partner
would
urge
him
to
appoint
strong
people
to
share
the
burden
of
global
leadership
for
many
the
loss
of
bob
rubin
be
far
more
than
the
loss
of
a
unique
business
leader
it
be
spiritual
for
me
recall
styer
the
define
picture
of
what
it
really
meant
to
be
a
partner
of
goldman
sachs
be
the
picture
etch
into
my
mind
of
bob
rubin
and
bob
mnuchin
each
with
a
styrofoam
cup
of
coffee
in
his
hand
stand
together
in
the
trading
room
quietly
chat
chat
about
the
market
and
some
idea
of
what
they
might
do
and
it
s
only
seven
in
the
morning
why
so
intensely
engage
so
early
in
the
morning
every
day
because
that
s
what
they
truly
want
to
do
and
where
they
want
to
be
and
that
s
the
way
it
be
all
the
time
for
everybody
at
goldman
sachs
at
morgan
stanley
where
i
also
work
for
a
while
people
saw
their
work
as
personally
define
it
be
what
they
could
do
and
do
do
but
at
goldman
sachs
it
be
much
more
it
be
life
in
the
past
the
firm
s
career
compact
with
its
professional
staff
have
be
clear
almost
no
lateral
hire
so
those
who
have
make
a
commitment
to
the
firm
have
no
worry
about
competition
be
brought

however
this

by
so
many

that
it

never

in
a
very
different

from

as
an

and
their
style

to

concept

a
sensitive
feel
for
the
market

intuitive
and
boldly
take
substantial
risk
their
fundamental
difference
in
concept
and
approach
to
trading
would
spring
to
the
surface
when
both

for

look
for
people
who
could
make
goldman
sachs
at
least
fully
competitive
with
the
two
lead
bond
dealer
salomon
brother
and
first
boston
their
first
approach
consist
of
promotion
and
transfer
within
goldman
sachs
rubin
knew
winkelman
be
a
good
manager
of
people
and
a
smart
leader
with
the
power
of
discipline
determination
winkelman
be
rational
dry
a
bit
formal
and
a
loner
corzine
be
a
strongly
intuitive
risk
taker
and
a
relentless
trader
with
his
warm
teddy
bear
personal
touch
he
be
unusually
well
connect
within
and
without
the
firm
winkelman
be
not
willing
to
come
into
goldman
sachs
as
a
subordinate
of
corzine
s
which
be
what
corzine
clearly
expect
after
some
awkwardness
the
two
men
agree
they
would
share
an
office
on
the
fifth
floor
as
equal
when
friedman
and
rubin
be
appoint
co
coo
corzine
and
winkelman
be
make
co
head
of
fix
income
again
corzine
be
disappointed
not
to
be
in
complete
control
later
corzine
would
see
all
too
clearly
the
drawback
of
divide
executive
power
but
once
friedman
and
rubin
make
it
clear
that
corzine
and
winkelman
have
to
work
together
they
work
at
it
with
reasonable
success
once
we
developed
an
understand
that
we
would
have
to
work
together
say
winkelman
we
developed
a
sensible
structure
and
soon
found
work
together
be
pretty
easy
but
their
difference
in
personality
way
of
do
business
and
strategic
concept
could
neither
be
hidden
nor
fully
harmonize
when
friedman
and
rubin
have
take
over
the
division
in
the
early
eighty
they
identify
salomon
brother
as
the
business
pacesetter
and
the
firm
to
beat
in
a
deliberate
break
with
the
firm
s
tradition
they
hire
in
several
salomon
people
who
jump
start
the
buildup
in
the
mid
eighty
in
a
few
year
most
of
the
import
from
salomon
brother
have
left
but
they
have
make
an
important
impact
on
the

strategic

with
considerable

from
the
powerful

goldman
sachs
deliberately
and
conscientiously
transform
the
bond
business
from
the
old
business
of
make
judgment
and
take
risk
on

rate
and

proven

difficult

our

be
so
complex
now
that
it
be
very
hard
to
explain
while
the
guy
in
the
business
have
much
more
understand
of
their
business
situation
and
what
they
can
do
as
manager
it
s
really
hard
to
explain
to
people
outside
the

even
harder

them
to

where
they
developed
a
way
of
think
about
use
risk
productively
to
make
profit
explains
garonzik
we
make
every
effort
to
know
and
understand
each
risk
and
the
interconnectedness
of
all
the
different
type
of
risk
and
then
build
a
portfolio
of
business
risk
that
be
profoundly
different

sum
of

in

in

no

thought
his

be
surely
a

in

a

an

since

a

robert

to
black
and
scholes

a
rigorous
understand
of
the
logic
behind
black
scholes
he
show
that
the
value
of

can
be
replicate
with
a
simple
dynamic

cash
for
share
until
the
investor
wind
up
with
the
same
payout
as
the

so
the
value
of
the

be

of

early
subject
for
examination
be
the

change
the

he

he
learn
that
the
way
to
change
any
business
practice
be
not
by
sudden
revolution
but
by
propose
small

those

intellectually
ready

black

deeply
introvert

shy
he
seem
remote

aloof
to

this
set
him
apart
from
the
guy
bonding
so
common
in
an
intense
trading
environment
like
goldman

the

to
those
who

in
his

the

he
have
one
day
a

for
his

saturday

he
may
have

he
have
an
ideal
situation
wall
street
compensation
no
class
and
ample
time
for
research
but
others
resent
it
most
of
the
people
at
goldman
sachs
didn
t
understand
and
didn
t
see
how
black
could
be
add
much
value
because
there
be
no
trading
coup
or
corporate
transaction
with
his
name
on
them
black
be
never
part
of
the
firm
s
culture
in
many
other
way
he
interact
with
several
hundred
people
but
only
to
the
extent
that
their
interest
overlap
with
his
and
he
be
learn
from
them
without
rubin
s
sponsorship
and
guidance
he
would
no
more
have
become
part
of
the
firm
than
oil
mix
with
water
a
loner
he
never
could
join
in
the
intense
collaboration
that
be
so
central
to
goldman
sachs
s
operation
he
be
certainly
not
a
team
manager
and
he
have
no
sell
skill
and
no
interest
in
develop
client
relationship
particularly
outside
normal
business
hour
bad
use
black
with
client
could
backfire
on
a
salesman
because
black
always
spoke
as
he
thought
at
a
particular
moment
he
be
not
predictable
even
more
clearly
and
significantly
in
a
firm
where
make
money
be
the
common
denominator
black
do
not
consider
money
a
particularly
useful
measure
of
success
for
some
this
wasn
t
all
bad
as
jon
corzine
recall
he
be
the
easy
partner
in
the
world
when
it
come
to
discussion
about
money
basically
he
didn
t
care
devote
to
simplicity
and
clarity
when
give
direction
black
be
precise
and
expect
all
others
to
be
precise
too
so
he
forbade
take
decimal
beyond
the
significant
number
steve

a

who
often
consult

look

look

when
he
talk
he
sound
like

fischer
also

his
long
pause

rigorous
manner

he
must
be
a
genius
while
the
capability
of
trader
and
quants
might
be
integrate
their
payouts
could
differ
markedly
if
a

developed
a

model
that

to

and
how
to

it
might

the

developed
sardonic

there

the
rigor
of
his
logic
and
his
inability
to
be
anything
but
entirely
logical
lead
him
to
state
some
position
that
be
so
perfectly
rational
that
they
be
really
very
irrational
for
example
one
day
he
stop
everyone
s
clock
with
his
conclusion
that
goldman
sachs
should
go
short
ten
billion
dollar
short
in
financial
future
if
we
be
intellectually
honest
with
ourselves
we
will
go
short
future
by
enough
to
fully
hedge
our
exposure
to
the
cash
market
instead
of
always
be
net
long
that
way
we
will
be
operating
the
firm
with
zero
net
exposure
to
market
risk
any
idea
how
much
that
would
involve
ask
david
silfen
yes
i
ve
examine
the
market
risk
exposure
of
every
unit
in
every
division
on
average
the
firm
be
long
every
day
by
ten
billion
dollar
so
to
expunge
those
collective
exposure
to
market
risk
we
should
simply
short
financial
future
by
ten
billion
dollar
simply
be
the
key
word
recall
silfen
for
fischer
it
be
completely
rational
but
that
be
theory
and
the
pragmatist
of
goldman
sachs
with
less
than
one
billion
dollar
in
total
capital
simply
couldn
t
imagine
establish
a
simple
short
position
that
be
ten
time
as
large
as
the

s
total

black
s
idea
might
be
academically
valid

it
be
so
totally
irrational
that
it

besides
for

prevent

error
by

would
augment

enable

the
real

in

view
differs
from

of
the

costly

costly

offer
an
opportunity
for
trader
to
profit
black
held
the
view
a
superbly
profitable
view
when
put
into
action
by
goldman
sachs
s
trader
that
central
bank
intervention
be
never
make
to
earn
profit
but
be
often
make
to
move
interest
rate
or
currency
exchange
rate
in
way
that
free
market
would
not
and
that
these
not
for
profit
move
could
create
large
profit
opportunity
for
astute
rational
trader
black
argue
that
central
bank
intervention
be
usually
not
rational
and
so
be
wrong
and
that
trader
could
take
the
other
side
of
central
bank
distortion
at
significant
profit
those
profit
opportunity
begin
increase
almost
exponentially
in
the
s
within
month
of
his
arrival
black
begin
building
a
large
arbitrage
position
on
that

present
to
his

the

have
be

at
the
wrong
price
on
the

city
exchange
since
the
value
line
index
be
a
geometric
average
not
an
arithmetic
average
and
since
a
geometric
average
be
always
less
than
an
arithmetic
average
the
future
contract
be
always
overprice
so
the
appropriate
action
be
to
go
long
the
stock
and
short
the
future
a
nightmare
to
implement
unless
it
could

fortunately
the
dot
direct
order
trading
system
that
goldman
sachs
have
recently
introduce
be
automate
so
the

a

the

and
short

this
position
make
many
small
arbitrage

so
small
they
never
disturbed

during

it
represent
a
full
one
third
of
the

this
meant
that
the

be
the
odds
that
that
would
happen
could
you
work
on
it
this
same
question
soon
caught
the
attention
of
the
management
committee
when
rubin
ask
his
standard
question
what
s
your
big
risk
and
can
you
quantify
it
satisfied
with
the
answer
rubin
let
the
value
line
position
continue
when
close
out
later
that
summer
it
have
make

it
earn
a

black

become
part
of
the

partly
because
rubin
be
black

partly
because
in
many
respect
black

the

exactly
what

about

it

would

he
be
still
cautious
as
he
explain
goldman
sachs
have
long
avoid
go
into
the
investment
management
business
the
reason
it
want
to
avoid
any
conflict
with
its
institutional

and
several
of
the

s
most
active
block

customer
include
dreyfus
morgan

have
be

vocal
on
the

still
since

in

he
go
on
to
explain
to
his

that
most
of
the
express
concern
related
to
manage
common
stock
portfolio
a
much
high

business
because
the
ila

invest
only
in

and
charge
a
low

it
might
well
be
okay
nagle
say
ila

trustee
be
hop
to
have
a
decision
make
over
the

say
he
could

whitehead
offer
to
see
what
if
anything
might

do
and
agree

try
to
get
a
formal
commitment
from
his
partner
that
same
weekend
but
some
of
his
partner
surprised
him
with
strong
resistance
nobody
at
goldman

seem
to
focus

what
whitehead
thought

closely

the

this
should

no

in

manage

like

earn

approximately
five
million

in

with
virtually
zero

and
only
minor
incremental

while
any
hint
of

must
be
avoid
there
would
surely
be
profitable
way
to
coordinate
the

deal
business
with
this
investment
management
business
over
the
intermediate
term
the
goldman
sachs

force
could
surely
build
up
the

and
increase
management
fee
through
their
extensive
regular
contact
with

the
hope

of

cut
their

all

clearly
defer
this

not
the

first
disappointment
in
investment
management
or
its
last
before
take
over
ila
investment
management
at
goldman
sachs
have
have
a
desultory
and
disappoint
history
an
investment
advisory
department
be
organize
in
the
early
s
under
arthur
altschul
who
have
be
make
a
partner
year
before
mostly
because
he
could
contribute
capital
the
firm
need
badly
as
it
struggle
to
recover
from
the
loss
of
goldman
sachs
trading
corporation
and
the
lean
year
of
depression
and
war
altschul
s
business
model
be
impressively
unimpressive
fee
be
low
because
the
service
be
an
obsolete
nondiscretionary
advice
only
service
with
client
make
each
individual
trading
decision
the
people
in
the
unit
be
old
and
tire
and
there
be
few
prospect
for
growth
the
main
hope
for
this
dull
business
be
that
the
old
retainer
in
this
low
margin
go
nowhere
unit
would
not
make
mistake
that
would
embarrass
the
firm
with
client
for
its
other
line
of
business
goldman
sachs
partner
be
settle
in
the
conventional
view
that
as
a
lead
institutional
stockbroker
the
firm
should
stay
away
from
institutional
investment
management
they
have
several
strong
reason
the
firm
s
investment
banking
service
men
wouldn
t
want
to
risk
an
investment
advisory
portfolio
manager
s
have
poor
performance
even
for
a
year
or
two
everybody
knew
that
even
the
best
investor
have
dry
period
of
poor
performance
and
that
overall
relationship
particularly
with
corporate
client
could
easily
be
sour
by
such
an
experience
if
investment
advisory
use
the
firm
s
research
idea
how
would
it
manage
the
obvious
conflict
of
who
go
first
institutional
client
or
advisory
client
if
the
advisory
unit
bought
share
in
a
company
that
be
or
might
become
an
investment
banking
client
wouldn
t
the
firm
find
sell
that
stock
later
on
difficult
as
an
underwriter
the
firm
s
primary
client
loyalty
have
to
be
to
the
issue
corporation
so
buying
any
share
in
a
firm
underwriting
would
be
risky
if
the
stock
price
go
up
question
would
be
raise
be
the
offering
price
too
low
if
the
price
go
down
be
the
firm
stuff
the
obvious
policy
be
to
stay
out
of
that
whole
business
brokerage
be
brokerage
and
investment
management
be
investment
management
and
never
the
twain
should
meet
anyway
the
traditional
fee
for
investment
management
be
so
low
that
the
business
be
not
very
profitable
and
others
of
levy
s
major
block
trading
client
be
as
clear
spoken
as
dreyfus
have
be
if
goldman
sachs
want
to
continue
to
be
our
number
one
stockbroker
do
not
compete
with
us
in
our
investment
management
business
finally
everyone
at
goldman
sachs
remember
the
financial
loss
and
the
reputational
harm
to
the
firm
come
out
of
the
penn
central
fiasco
and
everyone
have
heard
about

the
perceive
risk

you
should
have

loom
large
in
the
mind
of
old
partner
particularly
manage
partner
gu
levy
we
really
bought
into
the
idea
that
you
should
never
compete
with
your
customer
recall
jim
gorter
we
believe
it
and
believe
in
it
that
be
certainly
right
at
one
time
but
just
as
certainly
we
stayed
with
that
policy
way
too
long
which
be
why
we
didn
t
get
into
the
investment
management
business
in
a
timely
way
on
a
major
scale
we
would
not
let
the
investment
advisory
division
recruit
anyone
from
our
institutional
client
we
do
not
want
them
to
take
business
away
from
institutional
client
or
compete
with
them
for
new
account
investment
management
look
like
a
very
low
margin
business
particularly
if
you
deduct
whatever
business
you
be
afraid
might
be
lose
in
another

ultimate

you
put

there
the
decisive
answer
be
the

for

no
the

levy
menschel
mnuchin
whitehead
weinberg
and
others
have
all
agree
in
the
s
to
stay
out
of
investment
management
to
avoid
conflict
with
stockbrokerage
client
some
be
concerned
about

client
be
upset
about
performance
problem
in
their
pension
fund
others
didn
t
want
to
have
conflict
with
their
brokerage
client
particularly
while
building
up
block
trading
but
as
gorter
concede
year
later
at
goldman
sachs
we
bought
the
importance
of
not
compete
not
conflict
with
our
client
but
even
the
guy
at
capital
group
one
of
our
large
client
never
paid
up
for
our
integrity
no
institution
every
paid
us
more
because
we
have
integrity
and
therefore
we
do
not
compete
it
didn
t
pay
to
be
good
boy
but
it
sure
cost
us
a
lot
to
play
that
way
our
decision
may
have
be
one
hundred
percent
right
in
but
the
world
keep
change
and
the
decision
be
never
revisit
so
what
have
probably
be
a
correct
decision
become
the
wrong
decision
and
that
be
a
tragedy

investment
management
business
and
they
be
back
then
explicit
that
be
in
investment
management
would
be
a
clear
conflict
of
interest
but
that
simple
stay
out
of
the
other
guy
s
yard
policy
could
not
hold
up
once
wall
street
discover
how
very
profitable
the
asset
management
business
really
be
one
of
the
first
to
see
how
profitable
the
business
could
be
be
gu
levy
what
transform
his
skepticism
into
enthusiasm
be
a
single
document
we
gotta
get
in
on
this
exclaim
levy
after
reading
the
ipo
prospectus
for
donaldson
lufkin
jenrette
the
first
security
firm
to
file
for
a
public
offering
with
the
sec
levy
be
astound
by
the
scale
of
that
upstart
firm
s
investment
management
business
and
how
amazingly
profitable
it
be
fee
be
not
low
they
be
high
a
full
percent
of
asset
cleverly
offset
by
rebate
percent
of
commission
generate
with
high
portfolio
turnover
this
meant
that
net
fee
be
actually
zero
to
the
client
but
income
to
the
manager
be
huge
because
portfolio
turnover
and
fix
brokerage
commission
be
both
high
no
wonder
levy
want
to
get
into
that
high
profit
business
right
away
waste
no
time
he
put
arthur
altschul
out
to
pasture
change
the
unit
s
name
to
investment
management
service
or
ims
move
bruce
mccowan
over
from
research
where
he
have
be
the
partner
in
charge
and
give
him
instruction
to
build
the
business
quickly
mccowan
pull
together
a
team
of
young
investment
manager
and
salesperson
and
go
to
work
on
develop
a
strategy
to
develop
business
mccowan
focus
on
invest
in
mid
cap
stock
with
growth
at
a
reasonable
price
or
garp
and
early
result
be
good
the
new
team
won
a
few
corporate
account
such
as
heublein
and
thanks
to
recommendation
by
selection
consultant
at
cambridge
associate
which
be
just
get
start
mandate
to
manage
pension
fund
for
diebold
crompton
knowles
and
bulova
watch
all
mid
cap
company
but
disappointment
soon
intrude
the
original
strategic
concept
be
to
get
major
sale
leverage
through
ibs
s
great
relationship
with
corporation
and
their
pension
fund
as
partner
denis
turko
later
explain
we
need
leverage
to
get
up
over
all
the
ingrain
prejudice
earn
prejudice
of
course
against
broker
related
investment
manager
for
churn
account
and
buying
deal
they
couldn
t
sell
and
all
that
jazz
we
thought
all
we
have
to
do
be
hitch
onto
the
ibs
powerhouse
and
the
rest
would
be
a
sleigh
ride
into
the
big
time
but
the
leverage
ims
hop
for
do
not
come
through
only
gu
levy
in
his
role
as
a
corporate
director
deliver
a
pension
account
then
the
long
bear
market
of
the
early
s
put
a
stop
to
any
thought
of
business
development
in
that
fierce
bear
market
our
stock
get
clobber
recall
turko
and
the
ibs
guy
be
all
say
jesus
i
work
for
ten
year
to
build
up
a
good
relationship
with
that
company
and
we
be
about
to
do
some
great
high
fee
investment
banking
business
and
get
a
good
return
on
all
my
effort
when
wham
you
guy
butcher
a
tiny
piece
of
their
pension
fund
that
i
help
you
get
and
everything
i
ve
ever
do
for
them
for
year
be
completely
ruin
so
no
not
a
chance
i
m
never
go
to
help
you
screw
ups
ever
again
ever
nobody
could
blame
them
but
it
meant
ims
would
get
no
leverage
from
the
firm
without
the
support
of
ibs
and
with
a
hangover
of
disappoint
investment
performance
the
best
ims
could
hope
for
would
be
a
year
or
more
of
consolidation
and
then
several
year
of
compete
for
new
account
one
at
a
time
it
would
be
as
hard
as
pull
up
tree
stump
and
the
firm
would
never
be
satisfied
with
a
slow
one
step
at
a
time
buildup
mccowan
and
his
team
knew
they
would
need
to
find
a
way
to
accelerate
their
progress
ideally
an
imaginative
break
the
conventional
rule
way
they
need
something
new
and
different
a
truly
clever
breakthrough
marketing
strategy
ideally
something
recall
turko
comparable
to
macarthur
s
land
at
inchon
international
invest
might
do
the
trick
international
invest
be
just
get
start
among
american
pension
fund
to
get
a
piece
of
the
action
a
few
u
s
investment
manager
accept
their
lack
of
foreign
experience
have
begin
link
up
with
london
firm
that
have
a
long
history
of
international
invest
maybe
goldman
sachs
s
ims
could
try
that
same
strategy
for
goldman
sachs
people
the
obvious
international
firm
to
link
up
with
be
the
asset
management
division
of
london
s
kleinwort
benson
since
tie
between
the
two
firm
go
back
over
seventy
year
kleinwort
benson
could
use
help
manage
its
u
s
investment
and
it
have
hope
of
develop
an
international
invest
business
with
american
pension
fund
that
be
start
to
diversify
their
portfolio
the
mccowan
team
thought
kleinwort
benson
s
stature
and
asset
would
give
them
just
the
extra
credibility
they
need
gu
levy
make
the
appropriate
introduction
and
both
party
agree
on
a
combination
of
the
two
investment
unit
goldman
sachs
would
own
percent
the
limit
allow
a
nyse
member
firm
and
kleinwort
benson
would
own
percent
those
do
the
actual
work
include
mccowan
and
turko
would
own
the
other
percent
a
contribute
factor
be
a
miscall
on
the
erisa
pension
legislation
then
pending
in
congress
goldman
sachs
expect
security
firm
to
be
prohibit
from
manage
pension
fund
but
the
final
bill
go
the
other
way
make
an
asset
management
unit
even
more
valuable
but
by
then
the
deal
with
kleinwort
benson
have
already
be
make
despite
all
the
high
expectation
for
the
combine
unit
kleinwort
benson
mccowan
it
didn
t
work
kleinwort
benson
never
move
much
of
its
u
s
business
over
to
the
joint
venture
and
with
typical
british
distaste
for
anything
as
crassly
commercial
as
serious
institutional
sell
it
didn
t
sell
the
joint
venture
labor
along
for
a
while
but
could
never
get
up
much
steam
in
the
american
manager
bought
out
kleinwort
s
percent
and
rename
the
firm
mccowan
associate
trouble
continued
as
turko
recall
bruce
always
thought
he
be
the
king
and
the
firm
be
his
kingdom
not
a
partnership
so
in
we
split
up
bruce
mccowan
left
mccowan
associate
that
split
up
be
do
very
quietly
because
goldman
sachs
still
own
its
percent
and
mccowan
associate
report
to
george
doty
we
knew
there
must
be
no
adverse
publicity
about
our
go
separate
way
or
doty
would
kill
us
he
always
kept
us
on
a
very
tight
leash
besides
we
have
too
much
respect
for
the
partner
of
goldman
sachs
to
create
any
difficulty
a
partner
say
bruce
be
disappoint
as
an
investor
because
he
didn
t
know
what
he
didn
t
know
so
he
make
way
too
many
mistake
beautiful
to
look
at
and
a
great
relationship
salesman
he
be
not
a
great
investor
soon
mccowan
associate
bought
out
goldman
sachs
s
percent
take
the
firm
out
of
the
investment
management
business
except
for
whitehead
s
institutional
liquid
asset
which
by
then
have
grown
substantially
from
five
hundred
million
dollar
to
thirteen
billion
dollar
one
strategic
solution
to
the
problem
that
have
plague
goldman
sachs
s
effort
to
make
a
mark
in
investment
management
would
be
to
acquire
a
small
firm
with
a
strong
investment
product
and
smart
leader
who
could
jump
start
the
business
in
friedman
suggest
to
steve
ross
and
richard
roll
that
goldman
sachs
could
buy
their
investment
management
firm
roll
ross
and
put
them
in
charge
of
the
firm
s
investment
business
assure
them
goldman
sachs
partnership
friedman
knew
both
men
well
ross
a
brilliant
economics
professor
at
yale
originate
arbitrage
pricing
theory
and
developed
a
model
for
pricing
derivative
he
have
consult
with
the
real
estate
division
s
management
committee
roll
equally
brilliant
be
a
professor
at
ucla
who
have
very
successfully
create
goldman
sachs
s
research
organization
in
mortgage
back
bond
both
have
demonstrate
their
flair
for
thing
entrepreneurial
by
create
their
hot
investment
management
firm
acquire
roll
ross
could
jump
the
firm
ahead
in
the
institutional
market
with
a
distinctive
quant
product
fischer
black
wasn
t
so
sure
we
should
test
their
model
rigorously
to
ascertain
that
it
be
actually
superior
to
the
model
we
already
have
ross
reply
it
doesn
t
really
matter
which
be
best
what
the
firm
need
be
a
broad
portfolio
of
investment
product
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
bet
the
future
of
the
business
on
any
one
product
ours
be
a
proven
winner
and
would
have
an
important
role
in
any
array
of
offering
and
that
s
what
s
need
as
he
thought
about
the
combination
far
however
ross
realize
he
really
didn
t
want
to
work
for
a
large
firm
i
treasure
my
independence
i
ve
make
my
fortune
why
give
up
my
freedom
for
more
no
sale
another
possible
effort
to
get
a
toehold
in
investment
management
have
come
and
go
in
when
congress
pass
erisa
turko
have
be
sure
such
major
legislation
would
create
real
opportunity
so
he
team
up
with
peter
hager
in
corporate
finance
and
go
look
for
way
the
firm

help

deal
with
all
those
new
rule
do
all
the
homework
on
everything
they
could
think
of
they
go
to
washington
to
sit
in
on
senator
kennedy
s
hearing
they
study
the

people
in

they
study
every
aspect
of
all
the
financial
question
finally
they
developed
what
they
thought

a
business
plan
and
take
it
to
george
doty
after
reading
their
plan

it

recall
cooperman
who
go
to
rubin

friedman
with
his
proposition
to
establish
a

just
what
cooperman

so
he
move
over
with
his

rubin
and
friedman
want
none
of
the
aggressive
action
of
the
more

so
they
told
cooperman
to
work
out

with

bob

until
they

they

when
the
trouble
of

on

all
would

some
of
the

get
pressure
by
the

be
the

and
some
of
these

that
they

with
the

john

close
down
water
street
and
return
the
investor
money
a
full
one
billion

all
cooperman
could
do
be
to
protest
that
the
business
he
have
have
in
mind
be
entirely
different
but
i
m
not
in
a

like

be
weinberg
be
unmoved
who
re
you
kid
say
you
have
a
big
hedge
fund
and
someday
decide
to
short
the
stock
of
one
of
our
investment
banking
client
there
could
be
big
trouble
and
you
will
never
explain
it
away
the
water
street
crisis
frighten
rubin
and
friedman
if
unknown
like
those
who
launch
water
street
can
cause
the
firm
that
much
trouble
say
friedman
with
your
strong
name
recognition
your
hedge
fund
might
short
the
stock
of
an
important
client
and
cause
us
all
sort
of
trouble
we
want
you
to
build
up
gsam
s
business
as
a
business
just
as
you
do
in
research
do
us
all
a
favor
forget
about
manage
money
as
a
star
portfolio
manager
with
a
hedge
fund
and
build
us
a
major
money
management
business
as
a
business
manager
you
built
research
up
from
nearly
nothing
this
be
the
same
kind
of
challenge
it
should
be
a
natural
for
you
the
strategy
cooperman
developed
be
to
downplay
the
institutional
business
institutional
client
demand
a
manager
with
a
well
establish
track
record
of
superior
investment
performance
over
at
least
three
year
and
direct
competition
with
institutional
block
trading
client
would
be
inevitable
cooperman
would
focus
instead
on
building
a
mutual
fund
business
and
sell
to
individual
include
the
customer
of
private
client
service
the
key
to
this
strategy
s
success
would
be
superior
investment
performance
which
cooperman
saw
play
directly
to
his
own
strength
as
a
lead
investment
strategist
and
stock
picker
who
be
well
know
and
highly
regard
by
the
pc
broker
the
best
part
of
cooperman
s
strategy
be
that
he
have
to
win
only
a
fair
share
of
the
money
flow
into
mutual
fund
it
s
a
huge
potential
market
say
cooperman
all
you
need
be
a
thin
sliver
to
make
a
very
profitable
business
strong
investment
performance
would
pull
money
into
the
new
unit
and
quickly
make
it
very
profitable
now
instead
of
need
five
million
dollar
to
invest
with
goldman
sachs
an
investor
need
only
cooperman
put
two
million
dollar
of
his
own
money
into
the
first
mutual
fund
and
encourage
other
partner
to
invest
their
personal
capital
too
to
get
salesman
in
pc
to
sell
the
new
fund
to
their
client
an
effective
financial
incentive
would
be
need
the
management
fee
be
set
at
percent
with
part
to
be
paid
out
each
year
to
the
salesman
who
put
their
client
money
into
the
fund
recent
investment
result
reinforce
cooperman
s
confidence
recommendation
from
his
research
department
have
best
the
s
p
by
percentage
point
during
the
prior
year
to
dramatize
the
level
play
field
the
eighty
person
gsam
division
move
out
of
goldman
sachs
s
office
to
a
new
facility
in
low
manhattan
to
avoid
client
conflict
cooperman
s
hand
would
be
tie
with
tough
restriction
impose
by
the
firm
no
investment
professional
and
no
mutual
fund
wholesaler
be
to
be
poach
from
any
client
and
john
weinberg
declare
i
ll
be
goddamned
if
we
ll
use
the
name
goldman
sachs
after
all
that
my
father
go
through
with
goldman
sachs
trading
corporation
he
insist
that
goldman
sachs
could
not
be
use
in
the
name
of
any
mutual
fund
yet
he
accepted
the
use
of
the
initial
g
as
the
first
two
letter
of
every
fund
s
name
so
the
connection
to
the
firm
be
certainly
no
secret
gsam
s
first

g
capital
growth
fund
be
launch
on
april
it
sell
well
with
a
substantial
fraction
of
the
buying
come
from

where
salesman
be
strongly
encourage
by
management
to
put
their
client
money
and
their
own
money
into
the
new
mutual
fund
cooperman
ever
the
portfolio
strategist
be
cautious
about
the
market
say
i
don
t
see
the
overwhelm
compelling
case
for
invest
fully
in
this
stock
market
of
the

raise
he
invest
only
one
third
in

he
be
right
in
that
the
s
p
rise
only
percent
that
year
but
after
a
percent
sale
load
the
fund
s
net
asset
value
be
percent
below
its
offering

this
shortfall
be
clearly
a
disappointment
client
partner
and
pc
men
be
not
amuse
in
the
market
be
up
over
percent
and
cooperman
s

do
slightly
well
but
after
the

result
many
pc
broker
have
decide
never
again
on
sell
gsam

another
reason

that
once

the

that

as

you
could

should
just
close
your
eye
and
wait
twenty
five
year
while
lee
do
great
thing
and
if
you
d
only
leave
it
to
him
he
would
give
you
great

if

him
for
twenty

armellino
knew
he
need
a
new
strategy
to
gather

and
he
knew
he
would

three
year
of
superior

performance
to
be

all
this
meant
that

we
draft
john

to

never

after
just
four
week
in

mcnulty
who

that
his

on
the

be
so
at
odds
with
cooperman
s
strategy
that
he
should
leave
gsam
and
transfer
to
another
division
see
any
move
to
transfer
out
of
gsam
as
an
act
of
personal
disloyalty
cooperman
as
mcnulty
remember
year
later
say
nobody
ever
leaf
work
for
me
if
you
do
leave
wherever
you
go
within
goldman
sachs
and
whatever
you
do
i
ll
be
look
for
you
and
i
ll
be
absolutely
against
you
mcnulty
transfer
anyway
several
month
later
he
ask
to
have
lunch
with
cooperman
lee
he
say
you
know
we
ve
disagreed
in
the
past
but
i
ve
say
nothing
ever
to
anyone
else
about
our
difference
now
i
need
your
help
because
i
ll
be
come
up
for
partnership
cooperman
knew
what
he
have
say
and
knew
what
he
could
do
but
he
decide
to
relent
i
won
t
vote
for
you
that
s
not
something
i
can
ever
do
still
i
won
t
hurt
you
i
won
t
vote
against
you
so
mcnulty
make
partner
he
would
soon
be
essential
to
gsam
s
eventual
great
success
cooperman
love
invest
and
have
only
reluctantly
give
up
plan
to
leave
goldman
sachs
and
start
his
own
hedge
fund
so
when
his
wife
of
twenty
five
year
say
i
ve
never
told
you
what
to
do
and
never
will
but
how
old
will
you
have
to
be
before
you
do
what
you
really
want
to
do
he
go
back
to
rubin
and
friedman
i
m
the
fifth
large
percentage

so
i
obviously
want
the
best
for
the

i
ll
give
you
two
full
year
then
let
me
retire

paul

be
clearly
not
use
the

have
concentrate

in
small
specialty
retailing
stock
while
cooperman
and
armellino
have
both
enjoy
important
prior
success
neither
succeed
in
the

management
business
because
in
addition
to
firm
impose
constraint
their
experience
and
their
managerial
instinct
be
not
in
harmony
with
the
special
need
and
rhythm
of
the
institutional

business
a
problem
that
be
neither
new
nor
limited
to
gsam
notoriously
executive
and
organization
that
have
be
successful
in
insurance

commercial
banking
fail
when
they
try
to
apply
the
lesson
learn
in
their
financial
service
to
an
apparently
similar
financial
service
investment
management
while
all
involve
money
and
service
the
particular
be
very
different
what
work
well
in
one
financial
service
can
fail
in
another
even
obviously
similar
investment
service
such
as

institutional
separate

involve
significant
difference
in
sell
marketing
reporting

client
service
incompatibility
at
the
operating
level
be
one
of
the
reason
most
bank
and
insurer
fail
in
their
effort
to
develop
investment
management
business
even
with
their
own
good
customer
in
banking
or
insurance
another
reason
be
strategic
conflict
each
organization
s
strategic
priority
be
protect
the
current
strength
of
its
historic
business
just
as
goldman
sachs
have
protect
stockbrokerage
by
restrict
gsam
in
retrospect
the
best
and
boldest
strategy
for
gsam
would
have
be
to
jump
start
the
investment
management
business
by
make
one
or
more
major
acquisition
as
morgan
stanley
credit
suisse
first
boston
and
lehman
brother
all
eventually
do
but
this
be
prevent
by
a
major
problem
for
most
major
firm
include
goldman
sachs
a
misunderstand
by
senior
management
of
the
value
of
the
asset
management
business
not
understand
how
to
value
asset
management
business
they
couldn
t
accept
the
pricing
acquisition
to
make
a
strategic
entry
into
the
business
and
get
up
to
scale
seem
far
too
costly
for
year
and
year
senior
management
at
goldman
sachs
fail
to
understand
the
asset
management
business
as
a
business
so
they
make
mistake
major
repetitive
mistake
and
because
they
be
smart
rigorous
discipline
thinker
they
make
their
mistake
with
conviction
not
understand
the
right
way
to
evaluate
the
business
or
do
the
accounting
firm
management
didn
t
understand
the
asset
management
business
most
partner
thought
about
investment
management
as
a
personal
service
business
way
too
dependent
on
key
individual
they
do
not
recognize
how
persistent
or
sticky
institutional
account
relationship
really
be
even
as
key
people
come
and
go
and
say
the
real
asset
in
the
investment
business
the
investment
professional
who
be
essential
for
success
go
up
and
down
in
the
elevator
every
night
that
s
not
a
real
business
and
it
would
be
impossible
to
evaluate
or
put
a
fair
price
on
it
the
skeptical
partner
sound
astute
and
rational
but
their
conclusion
be
base
on
a
misperception
sure
some
investment
manager
do
believe
they
be
the
be
all
and
end
all
but
as
charles
de
gaulle
so
shrewdly
observe
the
cemetery
of
the
world
be
fill
with
indispensable
men
the
relationship
between
institutional
client
and
investment
management
organization
continue
on
and
on
even
as
the
specific
individual
representative
on
both
side
of
major
institutional

come
and
go
so
the
individual
who
ride
elevator
really
be
all
replaceable
the
secret
to
business
success
in
investment
management
be
not
so
much
investment
result
as
it
be

how
profitable

a

if
it
could
be
well
connect
to
an

juggernaut
like
goldman

the

a
solid
base
upon
which
to

the

want
to
build
gsam
s
business
with
a
major
acquisition
told
partner
i
say
five
year
ago
that
we
should
have
make
a
major
commitment
to
build
gsam
quickly
either
by
acquisition
or
by
multiyear
investment
spending
to
build
from
within
ford
saw
a
natural
strategic
fit
between
goldman
sachs
and
miller
anderson
sherrerd
so
in
one
of
his
regular
conversation
with
his
friend
and
neighbor
early
in
the
morning
on
a
lovely
spring
weekend
in
he
raise
the
possibility
of
a
combination
could
we
do
something
together
worley
and
his
firm
have
be
approach
about
an
acquisition
six
or
more
time
before
in
the
s
george
russell
of
frank
russell

have
come
with
a
two
hundred
million
dollar
offer
from
lloyd
s
bank
chubb

make
an
approach
but
be
wave
off
for
lack
of
fit
swiss
bancorp
and
ing
be
two
other
suitor
worley
recall
an
observation
by
the
man
who
do
the
most
acquisition
of
investment
management
firm
norton
reamer
once
say
investment
firm
only
sell
when
they
re
scar
well
we
weren
t
scar
and
knew
we
have
a
good
thing
go
worley
say
miller
anderson
be
not
for
sale
but
acknowledge
that
global
distribution
be
become
increasingly
important
and
that
he
recognize
this
be
an
area
where
goldman
sachs
have
proven
strength
discussion
quickly
accelerate
as
worley
recall
if
we
be
go
to
be
acquire
we
should
select
the
right
partner
ourselves
and
if
the
basic
term
of
a
deal
be
okay
it
would
be
well
to
be
in
a
truly
global
organization
like
goldman
sachs
merger
negotiation
go
forward
rapidly
and
easily
everyone
could
see
the
compelling
advantage
miller
anderson
have
the
product
while
goldman
sachs
have
the
delivery
system
then
obstacle
begin
to
surface
miller
anderson
people
want
to
stay
in
philadelphia
and
run
their
own
show
not
move
to
new
york
city
with
no
difficulty
that
be
agree
could
miller
anderson
partner
all
expect
to
be
make
partner
in
goldman
sachs
that
would
be
too
many
there
be
nearly
two
dozen
miller
anderson
partner
goldman
sachs
propose
three
partnership
miller
anderson
ask
for
twelve
a
specific
problem
for
goldman
sachs
be
that
the
name
founder
and
a
few
others
as
part
of
their
partnership
agreement
be
legally
entitle
to
a
substantial
annuity
payout
until
their
death
nobody
knew
quite
how
to
value
this
obligation
one
proposal
be
to
cap
the
payouts
at
current
level
and
limit
them
to
five
year
but
this
be
a
far
cry
from
the
perpetual
share
of
rise
earnings
that
the
partnership
agreement
have
carve
out
of
miller
anderson
nobody
at
goldman
sachs
have
ever
have
a
comparable
arrangement
and
nobody
at
goldman
sachs
like
it
miller
anderson
want
a
partnership
within
the
goldman
sachs
partnership
so
it
could
have
its
own
independent
compensation
arrangement
base
on
a
share
of
the
profit
it
generate
it
also
want
its
own
decision
make
process
for
the
partner
of
miller
anderson
an
earn
out
be
particularly
important
worley
propose
that
goldman
sachs
buy
a
large
percentage
but
not
percent
of
miller
anderson
s
future
earnings
so
there
would
be
strong
incentive
for
future
investment
professional
however
that
be
not
the
goldman
sachs
way
in
the
end
the
decisive
problem
be
both
financial
and
perceptual
in
one
four
hour
talk
corzine
and
armellino
explain
why
give
the
goldman
sachs
culture
only
a
few
partnership
could
be
make
available
and
that
limit
put
stress
on
the
deal
even
though
both
corzine
and
armellino
want
to
make
the
deal
work
in
addition
steve
friedman
still
think
the
asset
go
up
and
down
in
the
elevator
could
not
commit
to
the
million
price
that
miller
anderson
s
partner
believe
be
their
firm
s
true
market
value
an
important
part
of
the
financial
problem
be
that
a
partnership
have
great
difficulty
make
a
large
investment
and
fairly
distribute
the
cost
and
benefit
to
the
ever
change
partner
friedman
decide
to
lowball
the
bid
and
offer
just
two
hundred
million
dollar
that
final
offer
be
make
during
a
luncheon
in
new
york
city
with
worley
and
four
partner
from
miller
anderson
not
by
friedman
or
corzine
but
by
dick
herbst
a
lieutenant
of
friedman
s
who
have
be
act
as
the
banker
on
the
transaction
the
barrier
to
a
successful
deal
be
not
all
financial
the
two
organization
have
real
cultural
difference
and
very
different
partnership
expectation
at
gsam
the
culture
be
to
start
work
before
seven
each
morning
most
people
be
go
full
tilt
by
seven
and
many
be
in
the
office
every
saturday
there
be
a
lot
of
travel
too
the
senior
professional
at
miller
anderson
have
not
be
work
nearly
this
hard
and
get
paid
several
time
as
much
as
gsam
partner
so
there
be
a
real
miss
on
cultural
fit
and
compensation
in
january
friedman
have
retire
corzine
and
ford
come
back
to
miller
anderson
sherrerd
but
a
deal
be
still
unworkable
when
they
get
wind
that
miller
anderson
be
in
early
negotiation
with
morgan
stanley
they
be
upset
and
call
worley
as
a
public
company
morgan
stanley
have
a
convenient
currency
in
its
stock
and
be
willing
to
design
the
specific
deal
term
to
suit
miller
anderson
worley
spoke
directly
we
ve
be
friend
for
a
very
long
time
and
i
certainly
expect
to
remain
friend
let
s
agree
on
a
fair
price
fair
to
our
retire
partner
and
fair
to
our
young
partner
you
understand
fair
value
in
the
asset
management
business
if
goldman
sachs
want
to
make
a
fair
offer
tell
me
and
we
ll
call
off
our
discussion
with
morgan
stanley
but
worley
s
invitation
be
not
one
goldman
sachs
be
ready
to
accept
as
worley
observes
with
a
know
smile
any
deal
goldman
sachs
want
to
do
you
don
t
want
to
be
on
the
other
side
a
year
later

robert
maxwell
the
client
from
hell
robert
maxwell
be
found
dead
in
the
water
off
the
canary
island
not
far
from
his
yacht
the
lady
ghislaine
on
november
nude
and
apparently
a
suicide
if
as
most
observer
believe
the
bizarre
british
publisher
and
high
profile
goldman
sachs
customer
have
commit
suicide
it
be
the
one
last
way
for
him
to
escape
year
of
public
humiliation
and
condemnation
for
pile
up
unpayable
bank
loan
of
billion
and
plunder
five
hundred
million
dollar
from
two
public
company
and
the
pension
of
thirty
three
thousand
british
worker
some
suggest
that
maxwell
who
suffer
from
prostate
constriction
and
be
seriously
overweight
simply
fell
overboard
while
struggle
to
urinate
after
have
too
much
to
drink
others
note
that
the
sea
be
unusually
calm
that
night
and
that
the
rail
on
the
lady
ghislaine
be
three
and
a
half
foot
high
and
claim
inside
knowledge
say
maxwell
s
death
be
not
suicide
it
be
they
insist
murder
by
mossad
the
israeli
secret
service
for
which
maxwell
allegedly
have
long
be
an
agent
why
kill
him
because
give
his
severe
financial
failure
he
be
no
longer
reliable
the
initial
pathologist
s
report
by
dr
carlos
lopez
de
lamela
say
death
be
due
to
a
heart
attack
but
maxwell
s
own
doctor
say
he
be
not
suffer
a
heart
condition
he
do
not
think
death
be
due
to
natural
cause
the
far
more
realistic
and
credible
explanation
be
that
maxwell
knew
he
be
in
an
unwinnable
confrontation
with
goldman
sachs
to
which
he
owe
a
huge
debt
and
which
be
insist
on
immediate
payment
maxwell
have
also
just
be
told
by
lehman
brother
of
its
intention
to

of
his
large

to
that
firm
and
credit
suisse
first
boston
be
demand
payment
of
a
big
loan
too
maxwell
knew
that
the
amazingly
complex
many
layer
game
he
have
be
play
with
increase
desperation
be
now
over
he
be
sure
to
be
bankrupt

and
humiliate
publicly
in
a
very
short
while
he
have
nothing
good
to
live
for
so
why
continue
suicide
be
maxwell
s
last
way
to
control
event
as
he
have
do
so
often
before

he
could
not

everything

of

how
do
the

that
it

to

than

and
left
goldman
sachs
in
and
bob
mnuchin
do
so
in
while
both
men
be
remarkably
capable
mnuchin
and
menschel
do
not
like
each
other
and
could
not
work
together
so
the
two
part
of
the
stockbrokerage
business
sale
and
trading
be
for
many
year
run
quite
separately
after
they

combine
into
a
unified

division
under
the

over
the

since
gu

mnuchin
have
be
recognize
as
eric
sheinberg
s
rabbi
the
powerful
senior
who
would
watch
out
for
and
protect
him
mnuchin
respect
sheinberg
s
skill
as
a
trader
who
be
good
at
work
a
market
and
who
would
always
keep
his
mouth
shut
and
in
a
firm
whose
organizational
fiber
be
family
loyalty
mnuchin
and
sheinberg
have
both
be
son
to
gu
levy
and
mnuchin
instinctively
knew
the
duty
of
sibling
loyalty
sheinberg
be
absolutely
loyal
to
mnuchin
there
be
something
else
sheinberg
be
intensely
commit
to
goldman
sachs
as
one
of
the
partner
explain
the

be
eric

first
love
as
he
be
go

mnuchin
spoke
to
silfen
who
be
take
over
as
partner
in
charge
of
trading
eric
make
partner
before
you
do
so
try
to
be
sensitive
that
he
won
t
feel
right
about
reporting
up
to
you
he
s
very
good
at
trading
difficult
block
and
international
stock
don
t
make
the
reporting
relationship
too
hard
for
eric
give
him
some
room
to
do
his
thing
his
own
way
and
to
feel
good
about
his
situation
always
remember
he
be
senior
to
you
indeed
sheinberg
have
introduce
silfen
to
l
jay
tenenbaum
who
have
hire
him
so
on
a
personal
level
it
wasn
t
easy
for
sheinberg
to
report
to
silfen
now
as
his
supervisor
silfen
set
the
guideline
that
sheinberg
and
other
trading
partner
could
work
within
with
the
understand
that
sheinberg
would
always
call
if
ever
he
have
need
or
reason
to
go
beyond
those
guideline
then
silfen
say
eric
we
go
way
back
together
back
to
the
sixty
so
no
surprise
okay
from
new
york
city
sheinberg
have
be
supervise
a
group
of
eurobond
trader
he
have
hire
in
london
once
a
month
he
would
fly
to
london
take
his
trader
who
have
come
from
work
class
family
out
at
night
get
them
drunk
enough
to
loosen
up
and
learn
all
he
could
about
what
they
be
do
and
how
they
be
do
it
during
this
period
goldman
sachs
be
invite
to
compete
with
nearly
a
dozen
other
dealer
some
british
and
some
american
on
a
large
trade
for
the
million

portfolio
held
by
phillip
hill
investment
trust
the
competition
include
the
who
s
who
of
london
finance
so
a
win
bid
if
it
be
also
profitable
to
the
firm
would
be
a
highly
visible
signal
that
goldman
sachs
be
on
the
scene
and
a
factor
to
be
recognize
sheinberg
work
hard
on
pricing
the
numerous
individual
stock
in
the
portfolio
make
his
bid
and
won
robert
maxwell
call
the
new
york
office
from
london
to
congratulate
sheinberg
who
modestly
offer
to
visit
when
next
in
london
with
gusto
maxwell
urge
him
to
do
so
and
suggest
they
could
do
much
more
business
together
maxwell
soon
begin
place
order
with
sheinberg
always
call
personally
and
talk
about
market
and
price
sheinberg
enjoy
be
the
expert
and
maxwell
enjoy
share
view
on
trade
and
trading
strategy
they
be
both
market
and
trading
junky
and
be
soon
speak
on
the
transatlantic
phone
two
or
three
time
a
day
when
the
management
committee
decide
to
move
a
cluster
of
smart
young
up
and
comer
to
london
they
decide
that
sheinberg
while
old
would
be
include
sheinberg
s
special
interest
and
expertise
be
in
trading
convertible
bond
gu
levy
and
l
jay
tenenbaum
be
both
convertible
guy
and
appreciate
what
sheinberg
could
do
as
a
convertible
trader
because
trading
spread
be
narrow
in
new
york
and
the
business
be
get
less
profitable
sheinberg
s
plan
when
he
move
to
london
be
to
work
the
european
market
where
spread
be
still
wide
and
good
profit
could
be
create
at
low
risk
he
have
make
major
money
for
the
firm
in
the
past
but
his
stature
in
the
firm
and
his
percentage
of
the
partnership
have
both
be
significantly
reduce
once
sheinberg
have
very
nearly
be
squeeze
out
of
the
firm
but
when
he
go
to
john
weinberg
for
whom
he
have
work
in
bond
to
complain
that
it
wasn
t
like
goldman
sachs
to
do
such
a
thing
weinberg
reverse
the
decision
now
sheinberg
want
to
make
a
major
comeback
and
be
determine
to
do
the
same
money
spin
in
london
that
he
have
do
elsewhere
this
time
by
make
american
style
market
in
british
stock
if
he
could
find
the
opening
sheinberg
knew
he
have
the
skill
to
make
a
major
impact
he
could
even
be
the
one
to
help
goldman
sachs
establish
itself
as
a
major
factor
in
the
city
and
then
across
europe
as
he
take
up
his
new
position
in
london
a
series
of
subtle
factor
come
into
alignment
whose
composite
danger
would
become
clear
but
only
in
hindsight
he
arrive
in
london
when
goldman
sachs
have
not
yet
developed
the
necessary
experience
as
an
international
organization
and
nobody
have
have
much
direct
experience
in
the
london
market
from
which
to
appreciate
the
clue
and
subtlety
that
expert
might
pick
up
always
clearly
on
the
make
maxwell
be
keen
to
do
business
so
be
bob
conway
a
young

partner
who
be
new

and
bright
but
not
protect
by
skeptical
instinct
transfer
to
london
in
the
early
stage
of
the
firm
s
buildup
there
conway
s
nearly
impossible
mission
be
to
break
into
investment
and
merchant
banking
in
a
market
that
be
already
overserved
and
have
neither
interest
nor
appetite
for
new
alternative
banker
particularly
american
realistically
conway
would
have
to
find
the
unusual
company
or
unorthodox
executive
to
get
a
start
on
make
a
breakthrough
conway
found
maxwell
the

way

a

conway
want
to

so
maxwell
who

begin
court
conway
invite
him
to
glamorous

conway

when
the
management

maxwell
because
he
have
a

up
to
his

conway
be
look
for
someone
to
take
over
the
relationship
and
see
if
other
kind
of
business
could
be
developed
instead
he
spoke
to

what

my

unequivocally
that
he
should
not
touch
the
account
with

either
proverbial
or
otherwise
conway
encourage
eric
sheinberg
to
develop
his
relationship
with
maxwell
and
soon
it
be
sheinberg
s
turn
to
be
invite
into
the
glitz
and
glitter
of

like
every

sheinberg
have
no

of

into
the

persuade
them
to
change
the
way
they
do
their

the

they
use
he

he
would
have

he
could

in
the

do

in
the
city
where
a
sense
of
the
market
might
have
warn
a
manager
of
potential
trouble
finally
sheinberg
be
a
loner
he
even
played
golf
alone
and
the
london
partner
didn
t
care
for
him
as
a

so
they
quietly
go
their
separate
way
none
of
the
other
london

want
to
work
with
maxwell
and
they
felt
they

because
goldman

some
within

the
basis
of

with
his
penchant
for

often
cantankerous
and
make
it
immediately
clear
to
everyone
to
stay
out
of
his
way
and
leave
him
alone
when
maxwell
call

that

for

there
be

of
talk
about

restructuring
know
as
big
bang
of

market
in

such
major

like
goldman
sachs
a
unique
opportunity
to
break
in
and
build
up
sheinberg
and
others
anticipate
that
london
would
go
as
new

have
go
in
the
s
from
a
pure
agency
brokerage

to
a
mixed

with
both

to
the
extent
the

plenty
of

best
of
all
if
everything
go
right
london
could
be
the
chance
sheinberg
have

for

his
chance
to
make
a
major
personal
comeback
if
he
make
a
real
success
in
london
he
d
be
back
on
top
he
be
on
to
something
before
big

allow
british

to
combine
all

do

so
the

take
dealer
even
after
big
bang
british
firm
be
cautious
about

but
goldman
sachs
and
the
other
american

take
the
initiative
commit
substantial
capital
and
take

in

sort
of

to
facilitate
large
block
trade
at
specify
price
eric
do
a
lot
of
trading
when
and
where
he
could
recall
bob
steel
when
he
get
to
london
we
be
small
and
outsider
in
those
day
people
in
the
city
care
a
lot
about
where
you
go
to
school
and
how
you
get
there
and
they
waste
no
love
on
american
try
to
muscle
in
on
their
business
particularly
since
it
really
wasn
t
a
very
big
business
office
be
shabby
trading
be
all
agency
business
and
there
be
too
little
business
to
share
and
we
american
be
there
so
eric
nose
around
look
for
people
who
might
like
to
do
business
he
particularly
look
for
way
to
break
into
the
british
share
business
and
maybe
into
continental
share
one
way
to
break
into
the
london
market
be
to
do
portfolio
trade
which
goldman
sachs
understood
well
from
year
of
experience
in
new
york
but
portfolio
trading
be
entirely
new
to
the
londoner
that
s
how
eric
sheinberg
have
met
robert
maxwell
where
sheinberg
be
cautious
maxwell
be
charismatic
and
large
than
life
and
make
thing
happen
sheinberg
checked
him
out
and
found
he
be
do
business
with
cazenove
and
all
the
other
establishment
firm
but
his
contact
at
cazenove
say
something
that
later
prove
prescient
we
do
business
with
maxwell
but
not
risk
business
where
we
would
be
dependent
on
his
judgment
of
a
situation
it
s
dangerous
to
have
client
who
could
be
adversary
sheinberg
have
go
to
london
at
the
same
time
as
the
a
team
of
strong
young
leader
who
be
determine
to
break
into
that
very
establishment
market
as
the
strategic
salient
from
which
goldman
sachs
could
then
expand
onto
the
european
continent
and
realize
john
whitehead
s
vision
of
be
a
global
investment
bank
the
campaign
would
begin
with
stockbrokerage
and
stockbrokerage
would
be
lead
by
institutional
block
trading
sheinberg
s
mission
would
be
to
build
up
block
trading
use
as
little
firm
capital
and
take
as
little
risk
as
possible
the
best
way
to
do
this
have
already
be
demonstrate
by
gu
levy
and
bob
mnuchin
link
institutional
trading
with
the
transaction
of
corporate
wheeler
dealer
get
in
the
middle
of
the
action
and
let
the
game
begin
block
trading
as
a
business
to
pursue
be
new
to
the
city
and
familiar
to
goldman
sachs
sheinberg
saw
maxwell
as
his
elephant
a
major
account
that
would
make
his
comeback
within
the
firm
we
be
infatuate
remembers
steel
who
share
an
office
with
sheinberg
maxwell
be
our
ticket
of
admission
to
the
party
we
knew
we
be
good
at
trading
and
eric
knew
he
be
very
good
at
trading
the
big
trading
account
be
often
unusual
and
they
re
never
girl
guide
the
more
business
eric
do
with
maxwell
the
more
interest
it
be
to
all
the
rest
of
us
all
except
gavyn
davy
goldman
sachs
s
chief
economist
for
europe
who
knew
how
to
read
people
like
maxwell
and
who
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
simon
robertson
who
have
many
year
of
experience
before
join
the

the

bad

then

london

bank
schroders
recount
a
similar
view
in
our
morning
manage
committee
meeting
we
take
the
view
that
if
one
of
our
eight
member
say
no
and
the
others
yes
we
would
go
ahead
but
if
two
say
no
we
say
no
maxwell
come
up
three
time
and
each
time
we
have
a
majority
in
favor
but
two
or
more
oppose
so
we
would
not
act

eric
saw
maxwell
as
his
ticket
back
to
significance
in
the
firm
and
told
others
to
stay
away
from
my
account
even
though
everyone
at
goldman
sachs
knew
the
policy
be
that
all

be
always
the

sheinberg
and
maxwell
developed
a
separate

deal
on
their

sheinberg
often
dealt
directly
with
client
who
particularly
like
to
trade
people
like
robert
maxwell
who
enjoy
the
excitement
of
make
large
trade
in
public
market
and
regard
themselves
as
quite
skillful
while
maxwell
might
have
several
others
involve
with
him
in
set
up
a
particular
trade
he
would
not
consider
himself
commit
to
a

until
he
personally
say
the
decisive
word
you
ve
dealt
sheinberg
set
up
large
margin

against

and
then

we

there

no

we
get
to
shoot
first
with
a
margin
account
the
firm
would
always
be
in
control
so
trading
for
maxwell
would
be
okay
even
though
underwriting
be
not
sense
opportunity
sheinberg
become
a
market
maker
in

and
maxwell
each
believe
he
would
always

the

sheinberg
appreciate
that
maxwell
be
a
clever
and
experienced
customer
deal
in
large
size
and
operating
at
the
edge
of
legality
but
he
just
knew
that
as
smart
as
maxwell
might
be
he
be
even
smarter
about
trading
and
market
and
be
certain
he
would
always
be
in
control
meanwhile
maxwell
respect
sheinberg
s
trading
skill
but
also
knew
that
he
be
not

sheinberg
everything
and

of
his
secret
be
crucial

and
experienced
as
he

in

we
all

maxwell

that
it
could
make
it
in
london
the
partner
of
goldman
sachs
thought
they
knew
enough
about
maxwell
to
protect
themselves
we
knew
maxwell
have
be
declare
in

by
a
british
supervisory
body
as
unfit
to

by
the

conway

confident
the

could
safely
take
berlitz
public
for
maxwell
for
two
reason
first
take
it
public
would
remove
berlitz
from
maxwell
s
direct
control
and
second
with
some
care
goldman
sachs
could
insulate
itself
from
maxwell
as
usual
hope
be
father
to
the
thought

as

the

nod
the
central
question
on
their
agenda
be
easy
to
say
but
hard
to
decide
partly
because
the
consequence
of
get
it
wrong
be
enormous
and
endure
partly
because
any
decision
would

partly
because
the
basis
for

would
necessarily
be
entirely
qualitative
fife
s
goal
be
clear
avoid
a
prolong
public
flail
of

and
reach

on
the
size
of

that
would
not
cripple
the
firm
avoid
an
indictment
be
paramount
the
consequence
of
a
criminal
indictment
and
conviction
would
have
include
suspension
from

grievous
loss
of

in

an
albatross
of
shame
with
all
sort
of
pariah
consequence
for
the
firm
fife
s
objective
be
to
build
the
evidence
and
understand
in
cuckney
s
mind
that
would
enable
this
experienced
career

professional
to
make
the
objective
judgment
that
scheinberg
s
behavior
be
an
aberration
not
at
all
representative
of
goldman
sachs
as
a
firm
and
in
no
way
indicative
of
the
way
goldman
sachs
would
behave
in
the
future
and
that
both
the
united

london
s
market
would
be
far
well
off
to
have

a
father
s
evaluation
of
the

of
a

for

knew
before

that

large

of

pensioner
partner

could
easily

the
scene
outside

in

be
photograph
and
give
statement
for
the
front
page
of
london
s
sensationalizing
newspaper
as
today
newspaper
coverage
in
london
could
be
relentless
with
seven
morning
paper
and
two
even
tabloid
that
follow
up
on
the
story

in
the
morning
the
competition
be
vigorous
the
maxwell
story
and
the
firm
s
involvement
could
sell
a
lot
of
paper
as
it
be
the
aroma
from
maxwell
noticeably
hurt
the
firm
s
business
in
the
uk
and
across
europe
over
the
next
year
or
so
through
it
all
the
partner
be
deeply
embarrass
by
their
own
question
how
could
we
have
let
that
happen
the
lesson
be
clear
nobody
can
ever
be
allow
to
operate
outside
the
clear
reporting
line
of
decision
or
the
chain
of
command
the
firm
have
stayed
far
too
long
with
the
old
way
that
might
have
suffice
several
year
before
for
a
much
small
family
firm
in
a
slow
pace
market
for
a
major
firm
deal
in
the
fast
global
capital
market
formal
risk
control
be
mandatory
and
the
real
test
of
a
risk
control
system
would
be
that
it
caught
not
only
what
you
would
not
expect
but
also
what
you
would
have
thought
not
possible
with
robert
maxwell
supervision
be
lax
acknowledges
jim
gorter
we
didn
t
have
the
necessary
check
and
balance
a
trading
relationship
that
start
out
okay
get
big
and
big
and
become
so
different
in
composition
that
it
be
not
okay
in
the
end
it
cost
us
a
lot
of
money
ours
be
a
very
complex
business
when
it
surge
forward
in
volume
and
speed
and
complexity
the
business
can
suddenly
outgrow
the
control
system
and
when
that
happens
mistake
get
make
not
all
of
them
be
caught
and
some
of
these
mistake
really
bite
you
we
be
lucky
to
be
caught
out
so
few
time
the
two
major
danger
that
come
from
within
a
firm
be
arrogance
and
counting
the
profit
so
the
maxwell
fiasco
have
one
good
result
much
strong
and
more
rigorous
risk
control
and
no
exception
it
also
strengthen
jon
corzine
s
case
for
public
ownership
because
in
a
public
company
those
heavy
cost
absorbed
painfully
by
the
partnership
would
simply
be
write
off
as
a
mere
stroke
of
a
pen
accounting
charge
the
maxwell
affair
soon
lead
to
the

to
an

mentally

for
the
maxwell
settlement
but
the
amount
have
be
base
on
estimate
with
the
settlement
estimate
would
shift
into
hard
number
inside
goldman
sachs
the
immediate
next
question
be
which
partner
would
pay
the
million
the

get
past
a

and
percent
back
to

be
particularly
important
because
at
that
time

make
a
huge
commitment
of
talent

to

that

act
in

with

on
the

of
any
agreement
with
robert

he
add
that
mr
maxwell
intentionally
and
successfully
deceive
the
firm
we
deeply
regret
this
and
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
and
with
the
information
now
available
to
us
we
would
have
act
differently
note
that
maxwell
s
son
and
others
be
acquit
after
a
long
trial
the
dti
inspector
say
in
view
of
the
acquittal
in
the
criminal
proceeding
we
decide
we
would
proceed
in
a
manner
that
do
not
and
would
not
be
see
to
call
the
acquittal
into

nonetheless
conduct
can
be
blameworthy
without
be
criminal
we
do
not
make
legal
determination
where
therefore
we
attribute
responsibility
we
do
so
in

in

the
primary

mr

to

testimony
by
kevin

the

interpret

as
tenenbaum
explains
just
one
of
hundred
of
factor
the
antitrust
division
have
injunctive
power
so
they
could
stop
a

long
as
a
year
with
an
injunction
and
no

can
wait
a
whole

but
the
ftc
do
not
have

it
really

even

i
couldn

the

he

i
knew
he
be
brilliant

so
i
say
if
i
ever
start
a
new
firm
i
ll
want
you
he
thought
so
differently
i
told
my
client
company
i
don

know
what
he
s
talk

he
do
and
you
should
do
what
he
say
the
capacity
to
encourage
others
to
talk
be
essential
in

where
every

be
always
look
for

assess
the

of

go
through

i
ve
read
your
public
announcement
and
want
to
be
sure
my
understand
be
correct
then
as
the
conversation
develops
he
might
ask
about
various
aspect
of
timing
or
specific
feature
of
the
deal
increase
his
knowledge
and
understand
of
the
always
change
situation
the
key
to
success
in
merger
arbitrage
be
the
ability
to
find
out
significant
information
so
that
you
know
you
be
the
best
inform
factually
and
then
to
combine
subtle
clue
into
an
actionable
perception
of

up
some

these

why

question
go
something

it

to
know
how
far
up
its

might
go
so
even
if
the
nikkei
appear
badly
overprice
now
that
didn
t
mean
it
couldn
t
get
more
overprice
for
reason
that
strictly
rational
westerner
might
never
understand
in
this
cross
cultural
context
it
make
little
sense
to
bet
heavily
against
such
a
possibility

if
you
make
your
bet
with

instead
of
simply
go
short
the
stock
in
the

you
could

work
closely
with
the

make
sure
they
have
close
frequent
contact
closer
and
more
frequent
than
any
other
arbitrageur
so
that
they
have
great
access
and
an
information
edge
legal
espionage
be
central
to
everything
arbitrageur
do
go
right
up
to
the

limit
to

sooner
than
the

superior
information
and
evaluation
be
the
only
legitimate
advantage
they
can
ever
have
when

ten

that
their

well
than
the

s
the
boundary
line
on
inside
information
for
arbitrageur
have
always
have
two
problematic
characteristic
first
the
line
be
never
clearly
delineate
and
second
the
line
be
never
fix
or
constant
as
steve
friedman
often
say
the
sideline
of
the
play
field
the
boundary
keep
shift
inward
you
never
move
but
suddenly
you
re
out
of
bound
rule
be
not
the
only
thing
that
change
volume
pace
and
scale
be
all
change
and
new
people
with
different
attitude
and
value
be
come
into
arbitrage
one
of
these
be
an
arbitrageur
name
ivan
boesky
who
ran
a

that
do
nothing

merger
arbitrage
boesky

different
as
an

that

so
while
the
number
and
size
of

have
increase
enough
to
dilute
the
possible
rate
of

outside
the

the
arbitrage
opportunity
increase
even
more
rapidly

more
in

lasker
s
view
the

could
possibly
be
in
some
trouble
finally
freeman
focus
on
marty

who
be
a
star
in

a
at
kidder
peabody
freeman
and
siegel
have
met
in
person
only
once
but
they
spoke
by
telephone
almost
every
week
and
be
use
to
contact
each
other
for
useful
information
and
insight
siegel
be
truly
unusual
movie
star
good
look
and
remarkably
articulate
and
charm
he
could
sell
almost
anything
to
almost
anyone
one
of
the
young
in
his
class
at
harvard
business
school
where
he
cheat
unnecessarily
at
touch
football
he
be
one
of
the
top
graduate
as
freeman
would
later
recount
i
told
mr
siegel
that
i
have
heard
there
be
a
problem
with
the
beatrice
lbo
he
ask
from
whom
i
have
heard
this
and
i
answer
bunny
lasker
martin
siegel
say
your
bunny
have
a
very
good
nose
freeman
thought
that
be
a
curious
semiconfirmation
of
an
unknown
difficulty
perhaps
a
delay
in
the

date
for

next
half

he
and
his
colleague
in

possible
interpretation
try
to
figure
out
what
siegel
s
cryptic
remark
might
mean
the
conclusion
they
come
to
be
not
correct
it
be
what
scientist
call
a
false
positive
know
that
kkr
have
carefully
developed
a
street
reputation
for
always
complete
its
takeover
freeman
and
his
colleague
in
arbitrage
figure
kkr
must
be
delay
the
closing
date
after
all
it
be
an
enormous
lbo
and
kkr
may
have
decide
to
take
more
time
in
arrange
the
very
large
bank
loan
freeman
felt
that
if
what
he
thought
lasker
meant
be
correct
postponement
would
spread
the
expect
gain
out
over
a
longer
period
of
time
which
would
reduce
the
daily
rate
of
return
he
decide
the
result
expect
rate
of
return
would
now
be
too
low
so
he
chose
to
sell
the
call
he
have
bought
for
the
firm
and
left
in
effect
his
earlier
sell
order
at
kkr
announce
that
its
offer
be
be
change
not
in
timing
but
in
structure
to
in
cash
and
in
security
this
be
a
different
action
than
freeman
and
others
have
expect
beatrice
common
stock
drop
sharply
to
down
even
though
his
conclusion
have
be
wrong
by
trading
that
morning
freeman
have
avoid
personal
loss
of
and
an
estimate
loss
for
the
firm
of
ironically
even
if
freeman
and
his
colleague
have
understood
lasker
s
remark
correctly
they
would
have
gotten
it
wrong
again
once
they
heard
how
the
deal
structure
have
actually
change
they
estimate
that
the
change
would
cause
the
stock
to
drop
by
only
to
cent
certainly
not
by
four
dollar
a
share
not
enough
to
justify
sell
the
beatrice
stock
or
call
the
government
would
argue
that
after
hearing
siegel
s
bunny
comment
freeman
should
have
know
he
be
now
legally
an
insider
even
though
he
seriously
misinterpret
the
information
and
pull
his
order
to
sell
the
usual
test
of
insider
information
be
whether
an
inform
investor
who
get
that
information
would
know
how
it
would
affect
the
market
price
give
him
an
unfair
and
improper
advantage
over
the
company
s
other
investor
if
it
take
freeman
and
his
colleague
half
an
hour
to
decide
incorrectly
what
siegel
s
comment
probably
meant
be
the
information
sufficiently
informative
to
be
illegal
insider
information
if
the
interpretation
that
freeman
and
his
colleague
make
be
wrong
and
if
they
would
not
have
take
any
action
if
they
have
gotten
the
likely
price
change
right
can
they
still
be
guilty
of
a
crime
of
trading
on
inside
information
do
it
matter
that
siegel
never
remember
the

bob
ask
me
for
my
perspective
on
the
deal
anything
i
say
would
be
absolutely
hypothetical
but
it
would
help
him

for

explanation
in

the

his

yield
little
when
the
prosecutor
ask
if
he
could
remember
anything
else
brosens
repeat
the
bunny
story
this
make
absolutely
no
difference
because
the
story
have
be
know
by
both
side
for
two
year
still
government
lawyer
would
focus
here
assert
that
when
siegel
who
be
clearly
an
insider
confirm
lasker
s
estimate
freeman
should
have
instruct
the
firm
s
trader
to
stop
sell
beatrice
because
from
the
moment
he
get
siegel
s
confirmation
freeman
have
legally
become
an
insider
too
in
a
memo
to
the
staff
the
management
committee
explain
that
our
lawyer
tell
us
that
the
law
underlie
this
charge
be
exceedingly
technical
and
that
while
there
be
a
factual
and
a
legal
basis
for
bob
to
plead
not
guilty
the
fact
be
very
unusual
and
very
unlike
any
other
criminal
security
case
that
have
previously
be
brought
if
freeman
fought
the
lawsuit
all
the
way
he
ran
the
risk
of
several
year
in
prison
among
harden
criminal
moreover
he
would
be
put
his
family
s
fortune
at
risk
because
civil
suit
could
follow
any
criminal
find
and
the
award
for
damage
in
a
civil
suit
though
difficult
to
predict
could
be
very
large
as
freeman
later
say
the
atmosphere
be
extremely
poison
for
anyone
who
have
anything
to
do
with
the
eighty
there
be
no
sympathy
if
freeman
insist
on
go
to
trial
and
the
jury
found
him
guilty
on
a
criminal
count
that
could
immediately
put
the
firm
at
risk
for
civil
suit
since
complexity
characterizes
arbitrage
as
a
business
it
be
perhaps
poetic
that
complexity
come
to
characterize
freeman
s
prosecution
and
defense
the
complexity
go
beyond
those
expect
of
negotiation
between
government
lawyer
and

of

from

that

in

well
that

than
john

chairman
david
m
roderick
of

have
do

like
this
when
carl

roderick
invite
icahn
to

once
a

for
several

of

during

roderick
go

for

icahn
call

they

not

every
two

and
then
even
less
and
less
i
ask
larry

what
he
thought
recall
weinberg
he

enthusiastic

he
could
see
the

he
agree

so
i
go
alone
to

rudy

too
what
a
break
here
be
eight
guy
all
from
brooklyn
so
i
told
them
about
the
history
of
the
firm
as
a
family
firm
and
about
my
dad
and
the
trouble
we
have
dealt
with
and
what
the
firm
meant
to
us
that
we
care
very
greatly
about
integrity
and
do
the
right
thing
and
accepted
no
hanky
panky
and
after
an
hour
and
a
half
about
the
firm
its
history
and
value
i
laid
it
on
the
line
if
you
can
write
out
on
a
piece
of
paper
something
i
can
believe
make
a
real
case
that
bob
freeman
do
anything
really
wrong
i
will
personally
kill
him

i
ll
bury

so
nobody
will
ever
find

it

to
his

both

anyone

in

to

the
most

and
distress
allegation
against

that

engage
in
an
eighteen

really
be
by
anyone
at
either

in

in
a
good
but
imperfect
position
to
invent

articulate
a
believable
alternative
reality
his
main
problem
be
that
he
have
no
access
to

data
on

he
have
left
kidder
peabody
and
be
attack
that

so
they
obviously
would
not
help
him
in
any
way
siegel
have
an
important
advantage
go
for
him
for

he

for

at

have
developed
an
unusually
close

who
write
not
only
a
series
of
article
that
seem
wonderfully
on

of

also
the

in

with

who
supposedly

then

its

he
begin

with

for

allegation
freeman

goldman
sachs
own
no
disney
stock
in
june
at

as
important

record
show
that
freeman

do
not
expect

to
succeed
on

greeting
kidder
peabody
expect
steinberg
to
prevail
goldman

expect

stock
as
a
buy
he
would
have
have
no
reason
to

it
to

so
there
would
be
no
remorse
for

consequently
no
motive
to
start
a

another

on

after

told

they
ll
sell
the

and
then

told

to
buy

however
by

kidder
peabody
already
own
share
of

a
broad
search
for
a
white
knight
bidder
have
be
in
full
swing
for
more
than
a
week
with
one
of
the
candidate
a
major
client
of
siegel
s
it
s
not
plausible
that
an
m
a
maven
like
siegel
would
not
have
know
that
continental
be
for

highly
dramatize

with

allegedly
say
it
doesn
t
matter
they

the

continue
siegel
be
astound
come
from
a
partner
in
the
firm
represent
continental
this
sound
like
inside
information
he
hung
up
the
phone
and
gaze
out
over
the
late
spring
panorama
of
the
connecticut
coast
he
knew
that
in
his
conversation
with
freeman
they
have
just
cross
an
unspoken
line
nicely
told
but
since
siegel
have
to
know
one
of
his
major
client
have
just
sign
a
confidentiality
letter
with
continental
he
could
not
have
be
astound
more
important
continental
group
be
gray
list
at
goldman
sachs
by

and
any
inside
information
would
certainly
have
be
kept
from
freeman
in
arbitrage
by
the
nyse
close
on
june
kidder
peabody
have
gradually
accumulate
share
of
continental
group
not
million
as
stewart
s
book
say
and
it
later
bought
another
share
for
a
major
firm
s
arbitrage
unit
this
be
not
the
urgent
pattern
of
buying
that
would
indicate
the
use
of
insider
information
more
important
freeman
do
not
get
involve
until
after
june
in
stewart
s
book
siegel
claimed
that
freeman
assure
him
that
west
coast
financier
david
murdock
would
top
goldsmith
s
bid
but
this
doesn
t
compute
because
murdock
do
not
decide
to
bid
until
early
on
june
the
day
after

company
appear
to
be
an
alarm
example
of
a
conspiracy
but
the
detailed
trading
record
contradict
that
appearance
siegel
claimed
that
goldman
sachs
have
take
a
massive
position
and
that
freeman
be
worried
about
possible
antitrust
problem
and
insist
that
siegel
provide
helpful
information
siegel
reluctantly
say
talk
of

be
just
a
ploy
to
get
a
high
price
and
encourage
freeman
to
increase
his
position
in
contrast
record
show
that

never
held

less

secret
information
on

that
cause
him
to
go
on
a
buying
spree
on

if
true
this
would
have
freeman
buying
on
insider
information
several
day
before
he
receive
it
more
interest
be
that
during
the
week
of
april
freeman
and
goldman
sachs
be
buying
stock
and
call
exactly
opposite
to

at
the

of

that
day
and
next
this
degree

make
it
hard
to
believe
there
be
any
collusion
or
tip
siegel
be
right
to
sell
and
capture
profit
if
he
could
be
legally
or
ethically
right
to
sell
when
as
kkr
s
investment
banker
he
have
insider
information
about
kkr
s
strategy
while
freeman
would
lose
money
on
his
trading
unocal
be
put
in
play
on
april
when
t
boone
pickens
make
a
hostile
tender
offer
to
pay
cash
for
percent
of
the
company
s
stock
and
if
he
get
that
do
in
high
yield
bond
for
all
the
rest
unocal
which
have
be
sell
below
a
share
jumped
to
nearly
to
ward
off
pickens
unocal
offer
on
april
to
pay
for
percent
of
its
own
stock
or
million
share
the
government
s
complaint
against
freeman
alleges
that
freeman
told
siegel
in
april
that
unocal
would
announce
a
partial
buyback
of
its
own
stock
and
that
the
offer
would
exclude
pickens
and
that
he
specify
how
many
share
unocal
would
offer
to
buy
accord
to
the
complaint
siegel
use
this
information
to
craft
a
clever
trading
strategy
buy
enough
put
option
to
cover
the
share
in
kidder
peabody
s
position
that
would
not
be
accepted
in
the
buyback
and
would
therefore
trade
at
a
much
low
price
than
it
have
paid
actually
from
april
when
unocal
announce
the
repurchase
plan
to
april
kidder
peabody
do
the
opposite
if
siegel
have
be
tipped
about
unocal
the
correct
strategy
would
indeed
have
be
to
buy
unocal
put
before
april
actually
kidder
peabody
sell
unocal
put
and
bought
share
its
large
purchase
apparently
believe
that
pickens
would
prevail
ironically
stewart
observes
that
unocal
show
how
important
seemingly
arcane
detail
of
financial
transaction
can
be
but
page
later
minimizes
the
significance
of
an
error
in
the
government
s
affidavit
in
which
doonan
transcribe
a
colleague
s
note
say
the
unocal
information
be
pass
in
april
rather
than
in
may
stewart
see
the
damage
to
credibility
that
the
senior
people
at
goldman
sachs
claimed
this
difference
of
a
month
create
as
all
out
of
proportion
to
the
degree
of
the
inaccuracy
but
the
shift
from
april
to
may
take
all
the
excitement
out
of
the
information
be
inside
by
may
unocal
s
defense
strategy
be
completely
public
and
all

only
be
the

proration
factor
not

before

this

before

factor
be

before
the

open
on
april
and
the

between

that

during
the
next
two
day

beatrice
be
the
only
deal
where
siegel
s
allegation
could
not

directly
refute
curiously
siegel
never
recall
the
bunny
exchange
if
there
have
be
a
conspiracy
it
would
have
make
no
sense
to
be
indirect
it
be
standard
practice
for
m
a

to
confirm
those
aspect
of
a
story
that
be
favorable
to
their

wouldn

we
obviously
have

i
m
say
that
i
don

of

where
you
rely

one

and
really
expect
that
you
be
go
to
be
able
to
win

so
i
think
you
can
be
confident
that
there
s
more
than
just
one
witness
five
day
earlier
a

by

against
mr

three
and
a
half
year
later
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
would
inform
the
court
that
siegel
be
indeed
the
only
witness
a
retrospective
study
would
describe
the
situation
this
way
never
well
conceive
to
begin
with
the
case
against
the
trio
begin
to
crumble
as
soon
as
defense
lawyer
get
a
look
at
its
detail
here
be
a
virtual
conspiracy
of
stranger
tabor
didn
t
know

and
freeman
didn
t
know
wigton
moreover
instead
of
subpoena
the
men
s
trading
account
to
see
whether
siegel
s
assertion
be
true
the
prosecutor
have
simply
arrest
the
men
when
they
finally
do
get
around
to
check
the
document
the
information
in
them

nothing
siegel

a

story
teller
he
be
speak
to
prosecutor
who
have
recently
be
uncover
conspiracy
in
the
mafia
and
in
drug
once
the
prosecutor
have
accepted
the
conspiracy
story
they
be
commit
to
a
very
cooperative
witness
and
to
a
compelling
story
that
fit
with
boesky
and
milken
and
levine
and
look
like
a
straight
shot
at
a
prosecutorial
success
ideal
for
launch
a
political
career
freeman
and
his
lawyer
have
to
prove
a
negative
and
show
that
the
goldman
sachs
trading
be
not
trigger
by
inside
information
not
illegal
and
not
base
on
siegel

allege
tip
but
rather
on
astute
analysis
of
public
information
a
much
less
interest
and
often
more
complicate
alternative
freeman
clearly
get
too
close
to
marty
siegel
if
other
arbitrageur
saw
siegel
for
what
he
be
why

off
he
be
that
good
at

convincing
compare
to
boesky

siegel
who
both
deliberately
frequently
and
knowingly
violate
the
spirit
and
letter
of
the

the
bad
that
can
be
say
about
bob

be
that
he
go
too
close
to
the
edge
when
he
call
marty

look
for
extra
insight
on
beatrice
that
like
many
others
he
be
fool
for
year
by
siegel
and
that
he
be
a
target
of
opportunity
for
an
ambitious
prosecutor
in
an
era
when

thirty

thirty
seven
month

to
reflect

the

freeman
s

robert
fiske
and
paul
curran
argue
that
his
crime
do
not
warrant
any
time
in
prison
and
far
that
leniency
be
appropriate
because
freeman
have
suffer
from
the

s
precipitous
and
highly
publicize
arrest
judge
leval
say
arbitrageur
who
disregard
the
law
and
their
practice
undermine
the
integrity
of
the
marketplace
it
be
precisely
because
of
these
fact
that
the
court
cannot
treat
the

as
one
of
small
importance
he
continued
i
have
receive
score
of

that
speak
very
eloquently
in
favor
of
a
man
who
be
obviously
a
human
be
of
value
the
particular
crime
be
a
matter
of
temptation
an
indiscretion
all
of
which
take
place
so
far
as
i
can
see
in
a
matter
of
minute
in
impose
the
sentence
judge
leval
described
freeman
as
a
very
chasten
person
note
that
letter
to
the
court
described
him
as
generous
responsible
and
honest
the
judge
say
freeman
do
not
require
punishment
of
a
serious
nature
still
leval
felt
he
be
compel
to
look
beyond
freeman
s
character
and
ass
what
impact
the
sentence
would
have
on
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
financial
market
and
for
that
reason
he
believe
incarceration
be
necessary
reading
slowly
from
a
yellow
legal
pad
judge
leval
say
it
have
astonish
me
to
read
in
the
press
that
conduct
illegal
conduct
criminal
conduct
of
the
nature
before
me
should
be
condone

treat
as
a
trifle
because
it
s
do
every

call
freeman
a
man
of
eminence
power
and
wealth
judge
leval
say
i
cannot
pas
a
sentence
that
would
give
the
world
a
message
that
when
people
in
those
position
violate
the
law
the
court
would
treat
it
as
trivial
whereas
when
a

steal
a

that

it

he
have
consider

have
conclude
that

he
settle

not
have
the
same
homosexuality
and
violence
that
high
level
prison
have
say
freeman
but
it
be
not
a
country
club
and
this
be
not
a
country
club
experience
freeman
do
his
four
hundred
hour
of
community
service
and
then
spent
two
year
settle
his
civil
suit
with
the

in
the
summer
of
six
and
a
half
year
after
his

he
be
legally
free
of
suspicion
and
accusation
as
it
turn
out
freeman
make
a
mistake
in
calculate
his
odds
like
any
good
arbitrager
he
calculate
the
odds
and
decide
on
the
fact
and
probability
as
he
saw
them
to
plead
and
settle
for
one
year
in
prison
his
calculation
be
accurate
but
not
right
have
freeman
wait
another
year
he
would
almost
certainly
have
be
let
go
and
all
charge
would
have
be
drop
as
happen
to
kidder
peabody
s
wigton
and
tabor
who
have
be
accuse
by
siegel
of
trading
on
inside
information
from
freeman
freeman
s
real
penalty
be
the
distress
impose
on
his
family
the
cloud
of
suspicion
that
would
hang
over
him
oh
yeah
freeman
isn
t
he
the
guy
who
get
caught
trading
on
inside
information
have
to
leave
a
high
pay
job
at
goldman
sachs
and
not
participate
when
the
firm
go
public

building
a
global
business
most
of
us
really
didn
t
know
much
of
anything
about
europe
or
the
uk
or
london
recall
gene
fife
who
be
go
to
london
from
san
francisco
in
only
a
few
month
after
triple
bypass
surgery
and
in
the
first
year
of
a
second
happy
marriage
fife
have
no
budget
and
no
authorization
to
hire
people
didn
t
know
europe
and
didn
t
know
any
partner
who
spoke
a
language
other
than
english
no
division
head
in
new
york
have
any
international
experience
so
fife
would
have
no
knowledgeable
supporter
fife
be
chosen
accord
to
jim
gorter
because
in
establish
the
firm
s
investment
banking
business
in
california
he
have
demonstrate
the
ability
to
build
business
almost
from
scratch
with
little
help
from
headquarters
in
new
york
and
that
be
what
he
be
expect
to
do
in
europe
from
a
headquarters
in
london
it
would
be
challenge
goldman
sachs
be
not
goldman
sachs
in
london
recall
fife
in
his
understated
west
virginia
way
while
john
whitehead
have
make
an
articulate
conceptual
case
for
international
expansion
the
firm
seldom
sent
top
people
overseas
because
the
management
committee
didn
t
believe
in
the
business
potential
and
didn
t
want
to
incur
more
cost
than
necessary
with
a
few
stellar
exception
particulary
in
stockbrokerage
where
strong
leadership
be
already
show
what
could
be
accomplish
the
firm
have
two
kind
of
people
in
london
people
it
couldn
t
or
didn
t
want
to
fire
who
have
be
told
to
move
there
or
leave
the
firm
and
people
who
be
content
to
work
with
second
tier
people
london
be
consider
just
a
cost
center
so
the
strategic
objective
have
be
clear
keep
the
cost
low
enough
that
london
s
loss
would
be
tolerate
this
of
course
produce
a
strategy
design
for
and
doom
to
only
very
limited
success
the
london
office
have
have
no
overall
vision
beyond
simply
sell
american
stock
u
s
government
bond
and
some
eurobonds
for
u
s
corporation
like
ford
none
of
this
be
or
be
even
hop
to
be
more
than
marginally
profitable
and
it
lead
nowhere
it
be
clear
to
fife
that
massive
change
be
need
particularly
in
investment
banking
our
challenge
be
to
replicate
goldman
sachs
in
london
and
across
europe
so
the
firm
look
felt
and
taste
like
goldman
sachs
as
much
as
mcdonald
s
be
mcdonald
s
in
frankfurt
germany
or
toowoomba
australia
to
do
this
global
branding
we
have
only
one
choice
our
standard
must
always
be
excellence
the
firm
would
have
to
become
truly
international
in
capability
and
commitment
this
meant
first
that
many
people
in
the
london
office
would
have
to
go
and
second
that
it
would
be
nearly
impossible
to
recruit
people
with
the
expertise
the
firm
would
need
to
make
consistently
astute
move
and
avoid
outsider
mistake
in
addition
to
these
strategic
challenge
fife
would
also
encounter
specific
problem
shortly
after
his
arrival
in
london
he
get
a
disturb
call
from
the
manager
of
claridge
s
hotel
two
of
your
young
people
who
have
stayed
at
claridge
s
for
some
week
have
this
day
be
require
to
leave
our
hotel
they
have
make
a
deliberate
shamble
of
the
room
in
which
they
have
be
stay
and
they
have
be
intolerably
rude
to
our
staff
we
will
not
permit
such
arrogant
behavior
from
now
on
mr
fife
they
be
persona
non
grata
at
claridge
s
this
hotel
be
not
a
playground
nor
do
it
fit
with
fife
s
mandate
in
the
management
committee
make
a
major
strategic
commitment
to
europe
send
ten
top
performer
to
develop
a
comprehensive
strategy
for
the
firm
s
business
in
london
and
across
europe
each
new
york
division
have
its
own
strategy
for
london
fix
income
be
sell
u
s
government
bond
and
eurobonds
to
european
at
very
low
profit
margin
investment
banking
and
debt
capital
market
be
sell
sovereign
bond
won
by
competitive
bidding
against
japanese
firm
that
care
only
about
volume
goldman
sachs
banker
be
pleased
when
the
firm
won
a
eurobond
mandate
for
an
important
u
s
client
and
only
lose
goldman
sachs
be
lose
million
annually
in
london
and
all
the
other
u
s
firm
be
lose
money
too
but
change
be
in
the
air
so
be
opportunity
turn
to
the
first
of
his
challenge
fife
could
have
fire
everyone
but
that
would
have
be
unnecessarily
hurtful
for
the
individual
and
for
the
firm
so
he
developed
a
different
plan
meeting
privately
with
each
banker
he
say
not
a
word
will
be
say
here
or
anywhere
but
you
need
to
find
another
job
that
really
suit
your
capability
and
interest
much
well
than
your
present
position
take
the
time
you
need
to
do
it
right
and
in
not
more
than
six
month
be
sure
you
have
complete
your
search
so
you
can
resign
from
the
firm
and
move
along
with
your
career
we
ll
help
you
but
your
next
job
be
your
choice
to
make
and
it
s
your
responsibility
to
make
it
just
as
it
s
our
choice
to
do
this
with
dignity
and
consideration
for
you
as
a
person
fife
s
gracious
way
of
deal
with
people
paid
off
there
be
no
unpleasant
story
in
the
london
newspaper
about
massive
layoff
at
goldman
sachs
and
one
of
those
oblige
to
leave
would
call
fife
a
few
year
later
to
say
a
newspaper
reporter
be
try
very
hard
to
get
some
dirt
any
dirt
on
goldman
sachs
the
caller
give
the
reporter
s
name
and
paper
so
the
firm
could
preempt
the
adverse
story
before
it
get
print
a
lesson
for
leo
durocher
that
nice
guy
sometimes

level
and
woolworth
have
agree
to
indemnify
the

against
any

this
agreement
be
customary
practice
in
london
at
the
time
but
the
provision
for
reimbursement
be
illegal
when
fife
found
out
he
call
woolworth
chairman
to
say
this
agreement
be
against
the

and
we
as
a

not
do
what
we
have
agree
to
do
we
urge
that
you
should
not
either
people
at
goldman
sachs
be
angry
they
knew
this
change
meant
they
would
lose

if
they
continued
to

fife
explains
leader
should
always
set
the
bar
high
very
high
and
then
find
the
way
to
meet
that
standard

and
you

and
m
a
strong
experienced
young

certainly
not
easily
do
it
be
a
fight
for

fife
recall
each

all
be
prepared
to
make
a
serious

a
crucial
difference
from
the
prior
two
or
three
year
tour
this
small
group
of
strong
performer
give
me
the
nucleus
we
could
build
from
david
fisher
a
lead
analyst
at
the
world
s
lead
international
investment
manager
capital
group
be
guest
speaker
at
goldman
sachs
s
equity
divisional
conference
in
richard

ask
him
so
david
if
you
be
go
to
build
a
strong
research
effort
in
europe
what
would
you
do
fisher
have
no
trouble
with
that
question
send
some
guy
like
jeff
weingarten
to
europe
and
let
him
figure
it
out
weingarten
an
all
star
beverage
analyst
have
have
a
fight
with
research
director
lee
cooperman
so
he
be
eager
for
a
change
he
be
soon
on
his
way
with
some
advice
from
cooperman
hire
a
few
high
profile
superstar
and
cover
the
rest
with
smoke
and
mirror
weingarten
knew
recruiting
in
london
would
be
hard
if
by
analogy
s
g
warburg
come
to
new
york
and
offer
him
a
position
why
would
he
leave
goldman
sachs
his
case
for
join
an
american
firm
would
have
to
marshal
a
series
of
strategic
reason
that
astute
analyst
would
find
compelling
fortunately
for
weingarten
big
bang
have
the
city
of
london
in
turmoil
and
merger
be
make
or
threaten
to
make
some
talented
analyst
redundant
so
analyst
be
look
for
strong
firm
firm
like
goldman
sachs
lead
british
firm
expand
onto
the
continent
invariably
thought
of
have
two
separate
research
department
one
cover
company
in
the
uk
and
another
cover
continental
company
this
give
weingarten
a
decisive
opening
his
strategy
would
be
pan
european
investor
wouldn
t
care
about
geography
they
would
want
the
best
idea
industry
wide
another
advantage
that
weingarten
have
go
for
him
goldman
sachs
analyst
could
link
with
investment
banker
which
would
enrich
their
expertise
and
their
career
opportunity
weingarten
s
strategy
be
to
concentrate
on
the
very
best
analyst
and
to
focus
within
this
group
on
those
who
like
to
work
hard
and
would
get
excite
about
building
something
new
and
different
as
part
of
a
win
team
commit
to
building
a
strong
european
presence
within
a
few
year
goldman
sachs

the
first
american
firm
to
break
into

top
ten
in
research
our
first
priority
be
to
generate
significant
profit
say
fife
after
that
our
priority
will
be
to
elect

so
we
can
make
the
decision
and
the
move
that
will
enable
us
to
continue

he

since

it

little
a

be
invent
to
get

of
why

the
only

he

on
how
best
to
position

over
the

as
an

great
men
would
be
unwilling
just
to
be
adviser
a

that
suggests
mere

horse
so
fife
have
sullivan
cromwell
organize
a
new
company
goldman
sachs
international
he

he
say
to

they

initially
skeptical
know
we
have
very
little
presence
in
europe
or
in
their
home
country
and
naturally
worried
that
we
want
them
only
to
take
advantage
of
their
connection
and
relationship
and
perhaps
even
drop
them
once
we
d
gotten
connect
they
be
sensitive
to
the
reputation
fair
or
unfair
that
the

early
on

that
the

not
simply
look
to
exploit
their
relationship
we

to
know
how
people
in
each
country
would
think
and
feel
about
different
question
we
want
people
who
would
know
when
we
be
wrong
or
about
to
be
wrong
and
would
tell
us
bluntly
while
not
oppose
to
their
help
on
specific
transaction
what
we
really
need
and
want
be
their
important
help
on
understand
in
their
particular
country
just
how
to
do
each
part
of
our
work
correctly
so
we

strong
british
merchant
bank
make
an
organizational
and
strategy
blunder
while
goldman
sachs
be
expand
its
strategic
option
and
add
substantial
deployable
resource
s
g

itself
in
strategically
by
acquire
small
go
nowhere
subsidiary
in
spain
france
germany
and
other
country
drain
and
disperse
its
capital
and
its
managerial
talent
when
thornton
take
over
ibs
in
europe
the
unit
have
twelve
people
know
the
key
to
success
be
not
only
to
have
people
who
be
high
in
both
energy
and
ability
but
also
to
focus
them
on
the
most
important
people
at
the
most
important
prospective
client
thornton
decide
to
reorganize
each
salesperson
s
effort
in
finland
we
have
a
good
man
but
he
be
cover
company
and
spread
way
too
thin
i
ask
him
to
make
a
list
of
the
twenty
most
important
people
in
the
country
and
focus
all
his
time
on
those
twenty
people
he
and
i
both
knew
that
would
create
a
problem
if
he
focus
on
just
twenty
and
any
of
the
other
one
hundred
do
a
transaction
someone
at
the
new
york
divisional
head
office
would
surely
be
quick
to
demand
to
know
why
we
have
miss
that
piece
of
business
so
i
say
i
d
take
the
heat
on
those
complaint
thornton
sat
down
with
each
ibs
man
to
review
his
list
and
the
frequency
of
his
call
on
each
key
prospect
he
be
look
for
each
of
his
twelve
people
to
make
one
or
more
significant
call
every
week
of
the
priority
prospect
twenty
for
each
of
the
twelve
only
twenty
six
have
be
call
on
even
once
during
the
past
three
month
after
that
first
review
the
number
of
call
drift
upward
but
still
only
one
third
of
the
prospect
be
get
periodic
visit
while
one
third
be
get
occasional
visit
and
one
third
be
get
none
but
thornton
stayed
at
it
after
nine
month
all
prospect
be
get
call
or
visit
every
week
and
those
call
kept
shift
toward
more
and
more
senior
executive
thornton
kept
remind
everyone
sure
the
treasurer
be
important
but
the
ceo
be
more
important
thornton
summarizes
the
goal
be
to
be
able
to
make
significant
call
three
to
five
time
a
day
every
day
we
want
a
discipline
systematic
way
to
insinuate
ourselves
into
the
power
structure
thornton
join
in
the
hunt
and
aim
for
an
elephant
we
be
do
little
business
with
bp
i
figure
out
that
john
browne
be
in
time
go
to
be
really
important
probably
ceo
so
i
start
call
on
him
in
my
first
visit
i
realize
he
be
brilliant
shy
and
reserve
we
get
nowhere
in
thirty
minute
the
meeting
be
over
on
the
second
call
i
take
mark
winkelman
zip
nothing
then
i
invite
browne
and
his
mother
to
dinner
with
my
wife
and
me
both
woman
be
sick
that
even
so
browne
and
i
be
alone
i
decide
to
open
up
to
him
make
myself
vulnerable
that
s
when
everything
change
because
he
saw
he
could
trust
me
the
dam
broke
for
me
but
for
competitor
the
barrier
be
at
least
as
high
as
ever
and
maybe
even
a
little
high
because
now
i
be
on
the
inside
browne
soon
advanced
to
ceo
and
bp
become
a
major
client
of
goldman
sachs
thornton
add
after
building
the
requisite
relationship
of
trust
and
depth
our
long
term
goal
be
to
do
consequential
transaction
for
the
market
leader
you
worry
about
what
drive
your
client
and
where
you
can
be
indispensable
this
take
time
meanwhile
you
have
to
pay
the
light
bill
it
s
easy
to
get
a
mandate
to
sell
a
u
s
business
for
a
uk
company
but
this
prof
almost
nothing
the
proof
come
in
do
real
work
on
really
key
matter
goldman
sachs
s
business
development
strategy
be
to
build
out
in
large
and
large
ring
start
with
u
s
transaction
such
as
acquire
u
s
company
for
european
corporation
issue
commercial
paper
or
sell
european
stock
and
bond
to
u
s
investor
the
next
round
of
expansion
be
base
on
help
german
or
french
or
dutch
company
do
deal
in
europe
outside
their
national
border
and
the
high
level
of
business
development
be
to
win
mandate
for
purely
domestic
business
inside
the
company
s
own
country
against
the
lead
local
competition
this
be
do
in
one
country
after
another
by
win
international
mandate
and
then
overservicing
each
client
company
until
it
decide
to
use
goldman
sachs
for
domestic
business
in
germany
deutsche
bank
be
so
dominant
in
every
way
in
financial
market
that
great
firm
like
s
g
warburg
willingly
confine
their
german
banking
business
to
specialized
one
off
transaction
or
study
for
small
company
that
deutsche
bank
really
do
not
care
about
the
proverbial
crumb
off
the
high
table
always
be
careful
not
to
challenge
or
offend
the
giant
goldman
sachs
take
the
opposite
approach
it
have
a
shock
almost
ludicrous
ambition
to
which
it
be
absolutely
commit
we
be
number
one
in
america
the
world
s
large
and
most
sophisticated
market
and
we
will
be
number
one
in
each
major
country
in
europe
include
germany
phil
murphy
a
rise
star
and
a
strong
leader
go
to
germany
and
learn
in
a
crash
course
to
speak
german
good
enough
when
work
directly
with
client
he
be
superb
at
organize
and
motivate
the
people
of
goldman
sachs
from
within
and
swore
and
drank
like
the
unabashed
irishman
he
be
open
to
new
idea
and
new
people
he
be
absolutely
commit
to
the
mission
of
establish
goldman
sachs
as
the
lead
investment
bank
in
germany
however
determine
resistance
by
the
establish
bank
be
certain
when
i
be
at
s
g
warburg
say
tim
plaut
who
take
over
the
firm
s
german
business
in
we
won
a
small
mandate
to
sell
bond
with
warrant
as
a
result
of
several
year
of
work
with
the
finance
director
of
a
major
german
corporation
deutsche
bank
get
wind
of
it
and
sent
a
very
senior
man
to
meet
with
the
corporation
s
ceo
and
say
there
have
be
a
mistake
by
your
finance
director
who
apparently
do
not
check
with
your
cfo
and
have
make
a
very
foolish
suggestion
to
do
a
financing
with
some
foreign
firm
this
cannot
be
it
would
be
entirely
inappropriate
we
share
this
work
with
only
one
bank
commerzbank
and
it
be
their
turn
to
do
the
next
transaction
so
please
make
all
necessary
arrangement
immediately
for
this
transaction
to
be
do
with
commerz
we
be
promptly
exclude
and
of
course
the
transaction
be
do
by
commerzbank
and
that
same
thing
will
happen
again
and
again
murphy
would
not
listen
to
such
advice
murphy
have
a
plan
identify
the
thirty
big
and
best
investment
banking
prospect
and
make
them
client
of
goldman
sachs
make
a
list
get
everyone
together
and
figure
out
who
at
each
giant
corporation
really
decides
which
investment
bank
to
use
and
which
product
to
use
then
figure
out
how
to
break
through
and
get
to
him
and
decide
who
at
goldman
sachs
can
and
would
do
it
this
of
course
be
absurd
except
for
one
reality
no
firm
have
ever
try
it
monopolist
and
oligopolists
be
so
sure
they
control
their
market
that
they
sometimes
make
mistake
they
don
t
always
do
everything
right
they
can
get
too
confident
sometimes
even
sloppy
or
arrogant
they
might
leave
opening
without
realize
it
they
get
so
use
to
have
all
the
business
that
they
don
t
work
hard
enough
for
the
next
piece
of
business
and
the
world
keep
change
in
technology
in
idea
in
priority
and
company
keep
change
as
people
come
and
go
some
have
new
priority
some
have
new
idea
some
have
new
relationship
and
many
want
to
make
their
mark
by
do
new
thing
as
plaut
explains
these
people
be
curious
enough
to
give
any
interest
firm
even
one
they
ve
never
see
before
at
least
one
short
introductory
meeting
if
you
tell
them
something
new
and
do
it
effectively
in
a
way
they
find
interest
they
will
see
you
again
murphy
put
one
name
at
the
top
of
his
list
and
the
room
full
of
german
national
burst
into
laughter
outrageous
never
not
a
chance
ever
the
name
daimler
benz
murphy
then
add
another
name
siemens
more
nervous
laughter
then
one
of
the
german
banker
stood
to
remonstrate
you
start
your
list
with
daimler
benz
and
siemens
so
i
ll
start
with
these
two
as
representative
of
the
reality
you
must
learn
to
understand
and
accept
daimler
benz
be
percent
own
by
deutsche
bank
deutsche
bank
have
always
do
all
their
financing
and
deutsche
bank
be
a
jealous
guardian
of
its
business
siemens
be
another
example
on
your
list
it
be
start
in
over
a
hundred
year
ago
and
be
actually
create
by
deutsche
bank
today
that
bank
always
provide
the
siemens
chairman
the
german
at
goldman
sachs
be
not
the
only
one
who
thought
murphy
be
crazy
to
be
so
audacious
and
presumptuous
morgan
stanley
and
merrill
lynch
executive
be
delighted
to
learn
that
goldman
sachs
be
go
down
the
wrong
road
in
the
wrong
direction
so
they
would
have
no
need
to
worry
about
that
competitor
at
least
not
in
germany
and
probably
not
in
all
of
europe
the
german
banker
insist
that
john
thornton
s
one
on
one
focus
on
the
decision
maker
a
focus
that
work
so
very
well
in
the
united
kingdom
and
scandinavia
couldn
t
work
in
the
structure
bureaucracy
of
a
large
german
corporation
where
the
ceo
usually
know
nothing
about
finance
and
even
the
cfo
be
not
much
involve
in
capital
raise
rely
instead
on
the
finance
director
and
all
three
of
those
senior
executive
and
all
the
director
each
have
a
veto
so
for
the
finance
director
there
s
serious
career
risk
in
use
a
new
firm
for
any
investment
banking
service
particularly
a
foreign
firm
like
goldman

list
of
the
ten
most
important
thing
we
want
to
get
do
thornton
recall
china
be
central
and
since
we
have
almost
nothing

he
told
us
to
go
out
and
get
the
people
we
would
need
fortunately
for
us
since
we
have
already
cut
back
earlier
we
be
hire
just
when
competitor
be

hire
the
very
best
thornton

no
time
follow
his

who
ask
tough
critical
question
exactly
what

what

the

what
be
the

a
string
of
others
as
the
question
pour
out
it
soon
become
clear
that
goldman
sachs
be
propose
to
tie
up
all
the
bank
s
future
business
without

with
him
privately
outside
the
meeting
he
want
thornton
s
advice
on
how

salvage
the
deal
thornton
suggest
that
icbc
should
renegotiate
the
price
to
value
relationship
for
example
you
can
get
substantive
explicit
commitment
like
have
jerry
corrigan
a
goldman
sachs
partner
and
former
head
of
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
new
york
come
several
time
a
year
to
do
seminar
on
risk
management
do
the
same
in
ten
other
area
where
goldman
sachs
have
expertise
you
can
really
use
goldman
sachs
be
soon
deliver
particularly
valuable
service
to
icbc
and
the
work
relationship
between
the
firm
and
the
bank
would
prove
to
be
highly
beneficial
to
both
still
the
experience
at
icbc
highlight
long
term
policy
and
practice
decision
that
the
firm
by
then
confront
as
a
public
company
should
it
have
separate
its
role
as
adviser
versus
investor
more
important
the
firm
would
need
to
develop
the
right
policy
on
personal
invest
as
individual
goldman
sachs
partner
bought
share
in
icbc
that
they
believe
be
sure
to
double
and
double
again
if
this
be
ever
interpret
by
the
chinese
as
an
indicator
of
opportunism
it
would
show
the
firm
be
unworthy
of
trust
over
the
long
term
member
of
the

ask
partner
bob
katz
goldman
sachs
s
general
counsel
to
stay
for
a
brief
one
on
one
conversation
after
the
weekly
meeting
of
the
management
committee
they
go
to
friedman
s
office
where
friedman
close
the
door
and
take
katz
into
his
very
private
confidence
for
the
next
several
month
hardly
anyone
else
other
than
barbara
friedman
would
know
what
friedman
be
tell
katz
a
month
later
friedman
met
bob
rubin
at
the
jefferson
hotel
in
washington
for
another
confidential
briefing
on
the
same
subject
bob
at
the
partner
monthly
meeting
in
september
i
ll
make
an
announcement
which
i
m
go
to
share
with
you
and
you
only
but
first
you
must
promise
me
absolute
confidentiality
that
you
will
never
ever
even
mention
this
to
anyone
katz
understood
when
he
come
over
from
sullivan
cromwell
he
have
assure
friedman
their
conversation
would
always
be
confidential
with
just
two
exception
something
criminal
of
course
and
anything
that
could
seriously
harm
the
firm
i
m
go
to
retire
from
goldman
sachs
later
this
year
probably
in
september
he
pause
and
bob
you
have
give
me
your
word
to
keep
this
absolutely
private
just
you
and
me
if
friedman
or
katz
have
know
what
trouble
lay
ahead
for
goldman
sachs
both
would
have
know
this
would
put
katz
in
an
awkward
position
as
general
counsel
his
first
loyalty
be
to
the
firm
and
not
to
any
individual
even
the
senior
partner
but
come
off
a
great
both
men
expect
to
be
another
strong
profit
year
neither
have
even
an
inkling
of
how
badly
would
unfold
friedman
believe
the
firm
s
strategy
be
in
place
trading
wasn
t
where
it
need
to
be
but
it
be
clearly
progress
most
of
his
work
have
be
do
the
maxwell
matter
be
virtually
resolve
he
felt
he
have
stayed
on
an
extra
year
already
to
manage
those
issue
and
he
obviously
have
his
mind
make
up
katz
ask
if
he
be
certain
absolutely
certain
i
ve
promise
barbara
this
job
be
a
killer
and
it
ll
kill
me
if
i
stay
in
it
and
she
know
that
week
later
in
the
early
spring
friedman
and
katz
have
dinner
together
so
they
could
talk
through
the
specifies
of
transition
they
chose
an
italian
restaurant
south
of
fourteenth
street
that
specialized
in
tuscan
cooking
hop
to
avoid
people
from
goldman
sachs
whom
they
would
probably
run
into
on
the
upper
east
side
no
such
luck
mike
mccarthy
head
of
municipal
bond
come
over
to
say
hello
a
few
day
later
ironically
on
april
the
firm
take
a
major
trading
loss
million
after
bob
rubin
s
announcement
that
he
be
leave
to
join
the
clinton
administration
david
silfen
have
go
to
steve
friedman
to
urge
him
to
appoint
another
partner
to
co
head
the
firm
ac
no
offense
steve
but
lead
this
global
firm
have
become
a
huge
job
too
big
for
any
one
person
to
do
alone
you
can
t
possibly
be
in
singapore
and
in
frankfurt
at
the
same
time
if
you
think
it
s
too
early
to
name
successor
take
roy
zuckerberg
he
have
all
the
star
and
bar
you
need
and
he
s
great
with
client
let
him
help
you
cover
the
base
because
as
it
s
structure
now
it
s
a
killer
job
frank
brosens
the
partner
in
charge
of
arbitrage
make
a
similar
suggestion
friedman
have
refuse
even
to
consider
such
an
idea
i
be
never
interested
in
run
the
firm
say
silfen
you
have
to
subordinate
your
whole
life
to
do
that
job
which
i
would
not
do
with
his
complementarycapabilities
roy
could
have
take
up
much
of
the
load
steve
have
be
share
with
bob
and
roy
be
of
an
age
that
make
him
no
threat
to
jon
corzine
or
mark
winkelman
or
any
of
the
other
aspirant
year
later
still
puzzle
by
friedman
s
rejection
of
the
need
for
help
some
partner
speculate
that
he
may
have
want
to
get
out
of
rubin
s
shadow
and
prove
something
to
himself
friedman
have
already
decide
who
should
be
his
successor
but
as
he
told
rubin
during
their
dinner
at
the
jefferson
i
can
t
sell
him
yet
to
the
others
on
the
committee
nor
could
rubin
persuade
friedman
to
stay
longer
at
the
firm
friedman
s
hope
have
be
to
give
others
time
to
prove
themselves
as
he
say
so
he
have
assign
task
to
test
their
leadership
and
managerial
capability
in
different
way
winkelman
and
zuckerberg
be
to
look
for
way
to
upgrade
the
firm

technology
and
corzine
and
paulson

assign
to
work
together
on

won
the
all

and
national
championship
in
wrestling
very
individual
demonstration
of
physical
prowess

similarly

specific
adversary
successful
performer
be
almost
necessarily
self
reliant
loner
as
the
pressure
and
demand
of
his
job
mount
to
unbearable
level
friedman
rely
more
and
more
on
the
one
person
he
knew
he
could
really
trust
steve
friedman
timing
matter
in
championship
wrestling
and
in
m
a
and
in
change
organizational
leadership
and
his
timing
would
go
against
steve
friedman
in
without
intend
irony
friedman
say
he
couldn
t
spare
the
time
and
energy
during
his
final
year
to
develop
an
effective
work
relationship
with
another
firmwide
leader
somehow
not
recognize
how
much
harder
it
would
be
for
new
leader
to
achieve
rapport
with
each
other
with
no
time
for
develop
understand
give
only
seven
or
eight
month
and
no
warn
of
what
be
go
on
a
natural
succession
solution
be
unlikely
friedman
s
intention
to
prevent
divisive
politics
by
confine
the
succession
selection
to
just
one
week
at
the
end
of
summer
would
compel
a
decision
but
not
necessarily
a
sound
well
accepted
solution
and
in
february
nobody
have
anticipate
how
harsh
the
market
would
become
during
especially
toward
the
end
of
goldman
sachs
s
fiscal
year
in
november
understandable
as
it
may
have
be
his
determination
to
go
it
alone
would
eventually
force
friedman
into
a
corner
he
convince
himself
that
it
would
be
politically
too
difficult
to
pick
one
or
two
people
to
work
with
him
he
worried
that
underlie
individual
friction
and
chemistry
issue
would
fester
with
a
long
interregnum
the
firm
have
never
have
a
nonobvious
leadership
transition
before
and
friedman
s
priority
become
avoid
a
long
horse
race
but
even
while
accept
that
conviction
as
plausible
almost
nobody
believe
his
decision
be
wise
or
right
not
right
for
the
firm
and
not
right
for
steve
friedman
particularly
as
the
fourth
quarter
developed
goldman
sachs
have
make
a
kill
in
foreign
exchange
in
by
bet
heavily
against
the
british
pound
and
have
a
fabulous
earnings
year
that
appear
to
prove
friedman
right
he
really
could
do
it
all
alone
friedman
s
pay
be
million
but
as
market
savvy
people
know
if
you
live
by
the
sword
you
can
get
whack
by
the
sword
great
as
have
be
for
profit
would
be
just
the
opposite
it
be
awful
by
the
end
of

be
tire
really
tire
and
decide
that
december
that
i
would
have
to
quit
both
freeman
and
maxwell
be
serious
problem
that
take
up
a
lot
of
my
time
bob
rubin
and
i
have
split
the
long
distance
travel
but
now
i
have
it
all
as
interest
rate
go
up
our
risk
control
prove
that
we
could
get
all
the
ratio
and
correlation
right
but
even
so
the
individual
trader
do
very
badly
and
we
have
to
instruct
specific
trader
to
cut
back
their
risk
position
we
be
afraid
of
get
caught
with
a
high
cost
structure
worldwide
and
too
low
a
trading
volume
and
too
little
investment
banking
business
and
consequently
seriously
inadequate
profit
we
have
to
cut
cost
a
lot
in
the
spring
friedman
suggest
cut
fix
cost
but
the
management
committee
believe
the
trading
problem
be
only
temporary
vote
not
to
cut
back
after
earn
million
in
december
the
first
month
of
its
fiscal
the
firm
incur
a
series
of
poor
month
even
loss
as
market
go
against
its
position
maxwell
s
margin
loan
be
still
open
and
the
settlement
be
sure
to
cost
the
firm
a
bundle
and
meanwhile
be
take
a
lot
of
management
s
time
and
energy
corzine
have
raise
another
million
of
equity
capital
from
the
bishop
estate
a
large
hawaiian
endowment
fund
but
the
trading
loss
dominate
everyone
s
think
large
trading
position
in
treasury
and
the
yen
be
hurt
and
a
position
in
gilt
in
london
could
go
either
way
quite
suddenly
friedman
be
warn
that
he
risk
be
tar
forever
as
the
guy
who
quit
and
ran
when
the
go
get
really
rough
but
he
have
make
his
decision
and
be
know
for
persistence
in
august
the
pressure
of
manage
a
global
security
business
that
be
struggle
financially
be
spoil
a
retreat
by
the
friedman
family
to
their
vacation
home
in
jackson
hole
wyoming
up
since
a
m
friedman
be
work
the
telephone
to
the
major
debt
equity
and
corporate
market
of
the
world
absorb
the
spot
news
that
the
firm
s
trader
in
london
have
just
take
another
loss
of
million
and
receive
an
indignant
call
from
an
executive
at
john
hancock
mutual
life
who
told
him
that
the
insurance
company
be
so
angered
by
the
firm
s
poach
one
of
its
people
that
he
be
cut
off
all
its
very
modest
volume
business
with
goldman
sachs
and
want
friedman
as
manage
partner
to
hear
directly
and
personally
of
this
major
decision
friedman
have
never
heard
the
man
s
name
before
and
the
insurance
company
wasn
t
even
close
to
be
among
the
firm
s
one
thousand
large
client
but
take
the
call
and
the
heat
be
all
part
of
the
job
and
the
immediate
reason
for
friedman
s
blunt
summation
as
a
visit
partner
recall
this
job
stink
i
be
never
driven
to
get
the
job
as
manage
partner
reflect
friedman
who
say
he
have
always
expect
to
retire
early
enough
to
have
a
full
second
career
i
be
driven
by
the
mission
the
need
for
change
and
that
mission
be
clearly
be
complete
actually
back
in
we
could
see
the
strategic
horizon
fix
income
while
still
not
great
be
clearly
get
well
and
well
the
global
organization
be
in
place
and
get
good
traction
in
all
the
major
market
the
culture
be
transform
with
a
new
strategic
dynamism
and
the
principal
investment
business
be
well
launch
although
the
old
guard
continued
to
worry
and
fret
over
conflict
with
client
even
though
we
explain
to
them
that
there
be
always
conflict
but
you
could
manage
the
conflict
with
full
disclosure
and
make
the
right
choice
and
we
be
make
money
profit
be
at
a
new
and
much
high
level
i
have
no
problem
run
the
firm
except
one
i
be
not
enjoy
it
client
relation
meeting
be
everywhere
and
all
the
time
i
d
get
back
from
a
hard
trip
to
europe
and
have
three
different
client
meeting
all
of
them
urgently
need
on
sunday
as
the
wall
street
journal
blandly
note
like
its

peer
goldman
be
hurt
when
the
yen
rise
against
the
u
s
dollar
and
interest
rate
rise
around
the
world
the
firm
have
be
bet
heavily
against
the
yen
s
rise
and
be
carry
huge
bond
inventory
that
plummet
in
value
when
interest
rate
shot
up
mr
corzine
concedes
that
goldman
fell
prey
to
the
sudden
shift
in
interest
rate
earlier
this
year
like
a
lot
of
other
firm
we
be
not
fully
attune
to
the
market
he
say
jon
corzine
and
mark
winkelman
have
agree
to
establish
two
large
arbitrage
trade
in
the
firm
s
proprietary
trading
account
one
be
a
municipal
bond
arbitrage
the
other
be
in
london
both
position
have
be
establish
too
soon
and
the
market
be
still
go
massively
the
wrong
way
on
both
corzine
knew
what
to
do
buy
more
the
bad
it
appear
he
say
the
well
the
reality
the
probability
be
strong
that
if
we
hang
on
and
even
increase
our
position
this
can
be
a
real
winner
corzine
wasn
t
listen
to
doubt
or
doubter
but
jon
strong
as
that
may
be
in
theory
in
the
real
world
we
could
run
out
of
capital
or
run
out
of
liquidity
or
run
out
of
time
before
your
sure
thing
come
home
and
pay
off
as
loss
pile
up
in
the
fourth
quarter
liquidity
wasn
t
threaten
but
the
firm
s
capital
fell
nearly
to
the
minimum
require
by
the
sec
bob
hurst
recall
with
admiration
jon
have
brass
ball
and
plenty
of
gut
but
corzine
be
a
partner
and
many
other
partner
include
steve
friedman
do
not
have
his
market
experience
his
trading
expertise
or
his
ability
to
maintain
calm
they
saw
the
large
repetitive
loss
and
they
be
deeply
concerned
even
frighten
steve
be
suffer
from
the
grind
stress
and
strain
of
the
job
recall
another
partner
the
market
be
unusually
difficult
and
friedman
be
not
a
deeply
experienced
risk
manager
so
he
wouldn
t
understand
how
to
deal
with
uncertainty
the
way
rubin
always
have
where
rubin
would
create
trust
and
calm
friedman
s
habit
of
ask
many
challenge
question
could
make
tension
bad
some
worried
about
friedman
s
health
people
could
see
that
the
pressure
be
get
to
him
and
be
say
you
look
green
or
steve
you
look
gray
and
ashen
others
found
it
hard
to
believe
he
have
a
health
problem
at
fifty
six
recall
one
of
the
partner
no
way
steve
s
always
worried
about
his
health
there
s
not
an
ounce
of
fat
on
him
steve
always
take
special
care
of
himself
physically
i
remember
a
dinner
our
key
partner
held
at
primavera
for
the
ceo
and
senior
management
of
sears
our
old
and
one
of
our
best
client
steve
come
forty
five
whole
minute
late
why
because
he
have
insist
on
go
to
the
gym
first
for
his
daily
workout
during
the
first
and
second
day
of
september
bob
katz
call
all
the
member
of
the
management
committee
to
remind
them
that
the
weekly
meeting
usually
held
on
monday
would
that
week
occur
on
wednesday
september
because
monday
be
labor
day
and
tuesday
be
rosh
hashanah
attendance
as
always
be
mandatory
whatever
your
plan
wherever
you
be
whatever
your
commitment
be
there
this
absolute
insistence
seem
unusual
particularly
since
with
so
many
people
just
come
back
from
summer
vacation
the
period
around
labor
day
be
usually
a
quiet
time
of
year
bob
hurst
call
his
friend
steve
friedman
to
ask
what
this
be
all
about
but
he
could
get
no
insight
just
that
it
be
a
mandatory
meeting
be
there
on
sunday
friedman
told
john
weinberg
over
lunch
and
then
call
john
whitehead
to
give
him
a
head
up
some
partner
believe
he
also
call
jon
corzine
and
hank
paulson
weinberg
say
the
partner
would
live
through
it
okay
but
not
the
employee
as
an
ex
marine
he
kept
his
true
feeling
in
check
that
first
day
but
later
his
outrage
would
again
and
again
break
loose
in
angry
invective
yellow
belly
coward
abandon
his
post
and
troop
in
combat
and
cowardice
in
the
face
of
the
enemy
be
toward
the
gentle
end
of
the
spectrum
of
hostility
weinberg
pour
out
at
every
provocation
for
many
month
he
could
not
contain
himself
he
simply
could
not
believe
that
anyone
would
care
so
little
for
the
firm
or
its
partner
as
to
just
cut
and
run
of
course
weinberg
felt
double
cross
too
he
have
identify
friedman
and
rubin
as
his
successor
and
felt
he
have
carefully
brought
them
along
so
that
they
would
have
the
right
experience
and
the
right
recognition
both
inside
and
outside
the
firm
smooth
succession
be
an
important
capstone
on
weinberg
s
own
career
now
he
be
outrage
by
what
he
saw
as
the
violence
do
to
the
whole
concept
of
loyalty
to
the
partner
to
the
people
of
the
firm
and
to
the
ideal
of
his
beloved
goldman
sachs
member
of
the
management
committee
met
as
usual
on
september
as
the
firm
s
leader
take
their
seat
for
the
meeting
everything
appear
normal
as
usual
steve
friedman
have
his
jacket
off
and
his
sleeve
roll
up
then
just
as
he
have
told
katz
eight
month
before
friedman
deliver
his
bombshell
to
the
member
of
the
all
powerful
committee
i
m
retire
at
the
end
of
november
as
senior
partner
this
be
an
absolute
and
final
decision
silence
not
even
a
pin
drop
then
friedman
say
this
must
be
kept
absolutely
secret
for
all
this
come
week
one
day
per
person
in
this
group
be
the
long
we
can
keep
the
secret
next
monday
the
twelfth
be
the
monthly
partner
meeting
it
will
be
mandatory
attendance
so
every
partner
will
get
told
at
exactly
the
same
time
between
now
and
next
week
all
this
must
be
kept
absolutely
secret
friedman
go
on
to
explain
that
he
have
promise
his
wife
that
he
would
leave
because
he
be
suffer
from
serious
heart
palpitation
i
have
heart
fibrillation
at
beat
a
minute
and
once
spent
nine
hour
on
a
gurney
at
new
york
hospital
with
fluid
drip
through
a
tube
he
and
his
wife
fear
he
might
be
die
and
both
agree
that
if
he
do
not
stop
the
job
would
certainly
kill
him
friedman
do
not
say
that
he
have
make
that
commitment
to
barbara
friedman
nearly
a
year
ago
or
that
he
have
told
bob
katz
back
in
february
the
speed
to
decision
now
require
be
completely
foreign
to
a
firm
that
have
always
be
slow
deliberate
and
methodical
about
change
in
leadership
even
at
the
departmental
level
so
that
everyone
could
adjust
and
get
comfortable
with
the
change
five

terribly
fast
such
speed
assume
everyone
knew
everything
he
should
be

that
it
be

the
firm
be
rush
by
an
artificial
time
schedule
felt
humiliate
friedman
broke
the

well
in

for
the
most
important
change
that
could
be
make
the
change
in

for

selection
no
time
for
friedman
to

with

friedman
say
he
chose
to
keep
the
time
pressure
on
the
group
to
keep
politics
in
the
bottle
know
the
usual
friction
between
banker
and
trader
but
speedy
change
be
foreign
to
the

adjustment
that

important
to
goldman

by
what

the

anything

on
what
should
and
should
not

now
and
particularly
on
how
to
decide
who
should

three
main
question

how
would
the

decide
internally
just
how

completely
undone
zuckerberg
capture
the
way
everyone
felt
when
an
hour
later
he
telephone
silfen
who
have
have
to
detour
to
his
local
hospital
because
a
family
member
have
have
a
severe
allergic
reaction
and
exclaim
i
m
so
totally
surprised
i
can
hardly
get
the
word
out
steve
have
just
quit
the
guy
come
to
our
management
committee
and
with
absolutely
zero

or
anything
steve
quit
friedman
do
not
try
to
dictate
his
successor
say
i
m
leave
you
ll
be
the
one
work
with
the
leader
you
select
so
this
have
to
be
your
choice
to
get
start
here
be
three
question
you
ll
need
to
ask
who
would
you
pick
to
lead
the
firm
pick
one
who
do
you
want
to
work
with
that
one
leader
other
than
that
specific
number
two
who
would
you
pick
as
an
alternative
only
later
as
discussion
developed
would
friedman
s
view
become
clear
as
he
block
some
candidate
and
assist
others
look
back
friedman
still
offer
a
favorable
view
of
his
think
at
the
begin
of
the
fateful
week
i
want
to
avoid
anything
that
be
political
and
i
want
to
give
myself
and
other
management
committee
member
the
opportunity
to
continue
to
evaluate
how
different
people
work
together
we
have
see
numerous
firm
in
which
the
succession
process
drag
on
and
be
the
cause
of
politics
and
divisiveness
or
a
long
drawn
out
transition
with
too
many
hand
on
the
steer
wheel
we
be
convince
our
firm
could
avoid
that
in
retrospect
friedman
cite
the
procedural
difficulty
of
not
have
a
board
of
director
that
would
in
a
corporation
make
the
decision
after
his
surprise
announcement
the
management
committee
spent
wednesday
through
friday
at
the
firm
s
headquarters
at
broad
street
in
an
endless
series
of
tense
meeting
the
firm
s
titan
most
of
them
wholly
unprepared
though
corzine
and
paulson
may
have
be
warn
try
to
reach
a
decision
on
who
would
be
their
leader
for
the
first
time
in
over
half
a
century
the
firm
do
not
have
a
strong
well
accepted
leader
in
control
sign
of
politics
and
personal
ambition
quickly
begin
to
show
as
individual
be
look
out
for
their
own
personal
interest
quickly
make
and
remake
alliance
and
commitment
to
position
themselves
advantageously
everybody
knew
that
the
financial
stake
be
huge
and
that
the
firm
if
it
do
not
get
too
badly
hurt
by
the
persistent
trading
problem
be
almost
certain
to
go
public
while
everyone
s
focus
be
on
what
be
best
for
the
firm
everyone
understood
that
when
it
do
those
in
the
best
position
would
each
be
worth
well
over
million
this
be
no
ordinary
time
a
week
after
friedman
s
surprise
announcement
the
firm
suffer
a
major
trading
loss
in
uk
gilt
when
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
raise
interest
rate
foreshadow
the
painful
fourth
quarter
look
back
year
later
friedman
be
still
convince
he
handle
the
change
in
the
best
possible
way
there
be
no
point
in
talk
to
anyone
on
the
management
committee
in
advance
of
the
decision
that
would
have
unleashed
a
torrent
of
politick
i
ll
support
you
but
you
re
gonna
need
an
experienced
vice
chairman
or
i
m
really
interested
in
head
up
investment
banking
or
any
of
a
whole
slew
of
deal
you
d
be
amaze
how
many
people
have
hope
even
expectation
of
get
to
the
top
david
silfen
be
clear
he
strongly
want
a
successful
process
and
transition
in
leadership
but
he
be
not
a
candidate
he
be
quick
to
admit
i
m
really
upset
not
at
what
be
be
decide
but
at
how
important
partnership
decision
be
be
make
in
a
compress
period
of
time
roy
zuckerberg
have
aspiration
but
he
be
old
a
senior
statesman
to
his
friend
but
perhaps
too
old
and
neither
an
investment
banker
nor
a
trader
he
be
the
ultimate
relationship
manager
or
to
his
detractor
merely
a
salesman
see
as
more
diplomat
than
leader
some
doubt
he
could
handle
the
tough
call
that
always
have
to
be
make
but
maybe
he
would
serve
as
a
placeholder
for
three
or
four
year
until
john
thain
and
john
thornton
would
be
ready
bob
hurst
be
too
young
not
well
enough
know
across
the
whole
firm
and
too
new
to
the
committee
besides
he
have
never
recover
from
the
description
of
him
as
hurst
first
worried
that
the
job
demand
would
imperil
his
already
strain
marriage
hurst
have
effectively
take
himself
out
of
consideration
when
he
say
to
friedman
a
month
earlier
why
would
anyone
want
your
job
it
s
no
way
to
live
friedman
block
mark
winkelman
say
he
be
too
independent
from
the
firm
s
norm
he
could
have
meant
that
winkelman
be
a
loner
but
be
dutch
winkelman
heard
it
as
foreigner
the
easy
reason
for
avoid
winkelman
be
that
jon
corzine
the
major
contender
be
a
bond
trader
and
so
be
winkelman
not
experienced
with
the
market
complexity
or
understand
winkelman
s
particular
brilliance
friedman
do
not
fully
appreciate
winkelman
s
skill
or
his
leadership
style
which
have
so
inspire
others
winkelman
be
so
rational
logical
and
quantitatively
proficient
that
he
somehow
never
recognize
friedman
s
discomfort
with
market
dependent
decision
winkelman
s
native
holland
be
a
nation
where
people
accept
blunt
confrontational
disagreement
believe
deeply
in
loyal
opposition
and
enjoy
stone
face
tease
and
mockery
none
of
which
be
comfortable
for
friedman
as
some
of
their
colleague
sense
he
and
winkelman
seem
almost
destine
to
be
on
different
railroad
track
at
a
management
retreat
that
friedman
have
organize
earlier
that
year
winkelman
have
be
ask
to
give
a
presentation
on
a
subject
that
be
important
to
friedman
after
the
presentation
friedman
have
repeatedly
ask
him
the
same
lead
question
know
that
winkelman
knew
exactly
what
answer
friedman
want
but
winkelman
do
not
think
that
be
the
right
answer
and
would
not
bend
friedman
get
increasingly
frustrate
and
show
it
in
addition
winkelman
have
always
focus
on
do
his
work
he
have
not
make
time
to
become
a
member
of
the
firm
s
social
core
on
the
management
committee
he
have
no
devote
friend
or
ally
in
contrast
corzine
seem
a
sure
bet
he
be
co
head
of
fix
income
the
firm
s
big
business
he
be
also
co
cfo
so
he
knew
the
number
and
he
be
an
engage
natural
leader
popular
and
smart
corzine
have
be
on
the
management
committee
longer
than
any
other
serious
candidate
and
as
cfo
he
have
the
broad
and
best
understand
of
the
whole
firm
and
each
division
he
be
close
to
the
bishop
estate
and
knew
the
key
people
at
sumitomo
he
be
recognize
as
a
great
bond
trader
who
have
make
a
fortune
for
the
firm
in
and
while
the
huge
loss
be
in
position
he
have
institute
he
understood
them
well
than
anyone
else
we
all
pretty
much
agree
on
corzine
recall
silfen
he
be
co
head
of
fix
income
which
be
become
the
powerful
profit
engine
for
the
firm
and
key
to
overall
risk
and
he
be
cfo
clearly
not
an
appropriate
separation
of
power
in
a
line
versus
staff
structure
but
that
s
the
way
it
be
at
the
first
count
while
not
unanimous
corzine
have
the
most
vote
friedman
position
himself
to
broker
the
final
decision
despite
have
stun
the
group
with
his
counterculturally
abrupt
leave
he
still
have
personal
momentum
from
past
year
as
senior
partner
and
a
large
reservoir
of
goodwill
from
his
many
year
of
hard
work
and
dedication
to
the
firm
in
a
series
of
private
one
on
one
meeting
friedman
work
to
gather
a
consensus
because
all
be
so
take
by
surprise
nobody
have
have
time
to
pair
up
into
alliance
the
way
friedman
and
rubin
have
do
firm
leadership
be
too
burdensome
for
just
one
person
everyone
agree
on
that
but
corzine
if
corzine
be
to
be
chairman
the
next
question
be
who
could
work
with
him
most
likely
as
vice
chairman
almost
everyone
favor
himself
for
number
two
friedman
recommend
hank
paulson
as
cochairman
others
be
oppose
then
zuckerberg
winkelman
and
paulson
be
suggest
as
a
trio
of
vice
chairman
but
paulson
say
he
wasn
t
prepared
to
move
to
new
york
from
chicago
just
to
be
a
co
vice
chairman
he
have
agree
with
his
wife
that
they
much
prefer
the
value
and
the
people
of
the
midwest
and
so
would
raise
their
family
there
friedman
met
individually
with
each
member
of
the
management
committee
work
through
the
if
not
you
who
question
and
get
view
on
the
optimal
management
structure
then
he
ask
that
each
member
put
his
thought
briefly
in
write
and
fax
it
to
him
while
each
man
on
the
management
committee
may
have
thought
or
dream
privately
that
he
should
or
could
be
chosen
as
the
discussion
go
on
and
on
friedman
push
harder
for
a
banker
to
work
with
and
balance
corzine
the
trader
the
choice
of
corzine
as
a
consensus
candidate
provoke
winkelman
to
say
he
couldn
t
after
year
of
work
as
co
head
of
fix
income
where
the
two
men
developed
a
high
degree
of
trust
in
each
other
and
share
a
small
office
agree
to
suddenly
be
subordinate
to
corzine
i
couldn
t
do
that
winkelman
say
even
though
he
believe
that
corzine
would
certainly
be
acceptable
and
could
well
be
an
excellent
chairman
and
that
corzine
would
be
far
more
successful
as
chairman
with
winkelman
as
vice
chairman
mark
winkelman
and
jon
corzine
knew
all
about
each
other
all
the
good
and
all
the
bad
besides
with
the
committee
have
agree
on
corzine
mark
really
didn
t
have
a
chance
of
be
chosen
recall
silfen
because
we
wouldn
t
want
two
people
from
the
same
line
of
business
even
though
mark
be
both
rational
and
discipline
the
choice
of
corzine
be
not
so
much
an
absolute
vote
for
corzine
as
a
relative
preference
for
corzine
over
others
corzine
but
not
the
other
candidate
be
at
least
acceptable
to
everyone
what
we
didn
t
recognize
at
the
time
be
that
jon
have
always
want
to
be
senior
partner
of
goldman
sachs
and
that
that
drive
ambition
have
define
the
way
he
built
alliance
and
loyalty
inside
goldman
sachs
as
a
natural
politician
it
be
in
his
blood
say
winkelman
later
others
would
wish
they
have
ask
winkelman
for
more
information
about
his
difficulty
in
work
with
corzine
but
those
question
be
not
raise
as
the
meeting
continued
at
the
un
plaza
hotel
and
at
friedman
s
home
at
one
beekman
place
friedman
make
an
increasingly
explicit
case
in
one
on
one
meeting
at
his
home
for
select
a
banker
to
work
with
corzine
he
never
have
to
be
specific
because
by
simple
observation
that
somebody
would
have
to
be
hank
paulson
who
be
already
the
person
most
often
chosen
as
number
two
friedman
felt
that
only
paulson
be
strong
enough
to
balance
corzine
such
a
pair
recall
the
success
of
whitehead
and
weinberg
and
fit
the
firm
s
traditional
focus
on
be
a
leader
in
investment
banking
almost
inevitably
the
consensus
jelled
on
paulson
as
number
two
to
corzine
however
this
power
pair
face
one
major
problem
corzine
and
paulson
do
not
get
along
well
and
some
of
their
partner
doubt
they
could
get
along
well
enough
to
succeed
as
co
leader
friedman
have
attempt
to
develop
their
rapport
by
assign
corzine
to
oversee
bond
deal
in
asia
while
paulson
supervise
asian
investment
banking
but
that
have
be
a
nonstarter
because
the
two
men
found
it
difficult
even
to
coordinate
their
schedule
they
each
go
to
asia
many
time
but
they
do
not
go
or
work
together
in
addition
some
worried
that
paulson
spoke
too
bluntly
too
quickly
and
too
often
to
be
put
in
a
top
position
for
his
part
paulson
still
have
doubt

on
saturday
september
corzine
and
paulson
seem
at
an
impasse
but
corzine
the
people
person
always
believe
he
could
work
with
anyone
anyone
who
would
make
the
commitment
to
work
with
him
so
he
reach
out
hank
let
s
go
for
a
walk
just
the
two
of
us
and
see
if
we
can
t
find
the
common
ground
basis
for
an
understand
during
their
walk
corzine
say
warmly

nothing
could
please
me
more
than
to

closely
with
you

work
closely
together

corzine
knew
that
be
what
paulson
need
to
hear
they
come
back
in
an
hour
with
what
they
thought
be
an
agreement
to
work
together
while
several
different
structure
have
be
consider
friedman
make
it
clear
in
public
statement
that
the
enormous

out
a
single
stand
alone
chairman
such
as
he
have
be
put
the
best
possible
interpretation
on
the
situation
a
few
week
later
friedman
say
we
be
sort
out
how
we
would
work
together
and
come
to
believe
corzine
s
and
paulson
s
chemistry
would
be
very
good
and
we
have
a
sense
of
optimism
about
it
they
want
to
work
together
but
the
compromise
like
so
many
compromise
be
inherently
unstable
not
one
ceo
and
not
two
equal
co
ceo

that
each
man
say
a
few
word
answer
a
few
question
and
then
leave
so
that
the

open
and

outspoken
while
both

earnest
midwesterners
paulson

a
traditional
republican
corzine
a
liberal
democrat
they
thought
differently
on
almost
everything
and
felt
uncomfortable
with
each
other

work
style
come
up
in
very
different
division
work
with
very
different

and
work
in
very
different
city
they
have
never

traditionally
the
best
bonding
experience
in
a
professional
firm
corzine
have
be
elevate
to
the

several
year
before

be
great
with
people
but
have
an
awful
time
tell
anyone
any
bad
news
if
he
be
suppose
to
tell
joe
that
it
have
already

that
joe
be
out
as
a
partner
corzine
would
call
joe
explain
he
d
really
like
a
chance
to
talk
ask
if
it
might
be
possible
to
get
together
for
dinner
wonder
when
might
be
convenient
and
then
be
deeply
appreciative
of
joe
s
make
the
time
on
his
busy
calendar
after
their
dinner
joe
would
know
that
jon
admire
and
like
him
a
lot
and
would
think
it
be
probably
go
to
be
time
for
him
to
leave
the
firm
in
a
few
year
but
that
it
be
a
decision
on
which
he
would
control
the
timing
paulson
would
call
joe
tell
him
the
decision
be
final
specify
joe
s
last
day
at
the

ask
joe
what
he
would
like
to
see
include
in
the
official
announcement
that
would
be
go

on
monday
peter
sutherland
remarkably
credentialed
when
he
join
the
firm
as
chairman
for
europe
want
very
much
to
be
a
member
of
the
management
committee
paulson
understood
that
corzine
be
to
tell
him
this
would
not
be
possible
but
after
corzine
spoke
with
sutherland
that
clear
simple
message
have
become
transmute
into
an
assurance
that
sutherland
would
be
name
to
the
committee
after
one
more
year
when
corzine
s
partner
express
their
dismay
corzine
multiply
their
distress
by
warmly
say
not
to
worry
guy
a
lot
can
happen
in
a
year
at
the
partner
meeting
on
september
friedman
make
his
announcement
that
he
be
retire
not
quit
retire
in
a
memo
to
employee
the
next
day
friedman
write
at
the
end
of
last
year
i
promise
myself
and
my
family
that
i
would
fill
my
role
for
one
more
year
and
then
pas
the
baton
to
young
successor
when
the
job
be
do
with
maximum
intensity
it
can
be
more
than
a
little
tire
have
be
a
frustrate
year
for
all
of
us
in
an
interview
he
concede
yeah
i
would
have
prefer
record
profit
but
if
you
take
and
and
you
average
them
you
get
a
record
when
steve
quit
without
do
either
of
two
thing
he
could
have
do
instead
he
threw
open
the
door
for
any
partner
to
quit
and
several
do
on
very
short
notice
some
with
only
a
week
or
two
s
notice
steve
have
two
easy
and
far
well
choice
say
lee
cooperman
first
when
he
told
his
wife
he
could
easily
have
told
his
partner
so
successor
could
be
chosen
and
work
together
for
six
month
or
so
and
then
he
could
say
these
guy
be
so
great
i
m
proud
to
say
we
can
turn
to
them
even
now
so
i
ll
be
leave
earlier
than
i
d
plan
carry
on
or
he
could
have
told
the
management
committee
he
have
to
quit
picked
his
successor
and
then
overlap
with
them
for
six
month
or
so
and
then
give
the
same
speech
they
re
great
they
re
ready
they
re
the
leader
and
left
early
steve
friedman
have
a
great
career
but
what
he
do
in
be
wrong
wrong
for
steve
and
wrong
for
the
firm
steve
s
action
in
suddenly
leave
the
firm
be
not
at
all
consistent
with
the
steve
friedman
i
knew
and
admire
recall
partner
bob
conway
intellectually
honest
to
the
first
degree
great
mental
candlepower
always
seek
input
from
everyone
and
act
as
decision
central
in
my
first
year
i
remember
work
on
a
valuation
fairness
opinion
and
need
someone
to
check
out
my
reason
and
my
analysis
i
ask
steve
even
though
he
be
not
involve
to
take
a
look
he
close
the
door
behind
us
and
spent
the
next
hour
and
a
half
go
over
every
aspect
of
the
valuation
with
me
i
learn
a
lot
about
valuation
in
that
one
and
a
half
hour
a
lot
about
teamwork
and
commitment
to
the
firm
and
a
lot
about
steve
the
wall
street
journal
in
an
understated
articulation
of
the
wall
street
community
s
surprise
put
it
this
way
goldman
sachs
have
long
pride
itself
on
a
tradition
of
carefully
orchestrate
the
leadership
succession
process
by
name
heir
apparent
and
groom
them
for
a
few
year
before
they
accede
to
the
top
job
the
firm
have
have
no
experience
with
a
force
transition
particularly
when
it
be
lose
money
since
the
day
of
waddill
catching
this
time
nobody
have
have
time
to
prepare
for
the
enormous
question
of
succession
and
the
firm
s
business
be
clearly
in
serious
trouble
with
those
big
and
big
trading
loss
with
friedman
s
sudden
departure
partner
begin
to
perceive
a
real
risk
of
the
firm
s
come
apart
or
even
be
torn
apart
by
heavy
financial
loss
and
sudden
defection
by
partner
the
two
main
challenge
be
clear
to
hold
goldman
sachs
together
and
to
reassure
all
the
firm
s
client
what
do
friedman
know
that
i
don
t
know
yet
be
the
question
many
partner
be
ask
silfen
recall
many
partner
come
into
my
office
to
sit
on
the
couch
despite
the
best
effort
of
john
weinberg
and
many
other
senior
partner
to
persuade
them
to
stay
with
the
firm
partner
defection
accelerate
set
a
grim
record
in
thirty
four
partner
from
thirteen
the
year
before
quit
each
additional
partner
s
check
out
increase
the
pressure
to
leave
on
the
other
partner
some
simply
cave
in
many
decide
for
the
first
time
to
take
the
call
that
come
with
increase
frequency
from
headhunter
investment
banker
perhaps
because
they
didn
t
really
understand
how
market
could
take
money
away
and
then
later
bring
it
back
didn
t
know
what
to
think
or
how
to
think
it
out
since
the
year
s
earnings
be
sure
to
be
unusually
low
those
who
be
think
of
bailing
knew
one
certainty
they
would
be
leave
little
money
on
the
table
if
they
do
decide
to
go
in
late
as
serious
trading
loss
suddenly
accumulate
retirement
by
partner
accelerate
friedman
never
recognize
that
his
abrupt
unilateral
retirement
broke
the
covenant
and
make
it
socially
acceptable
for
other
partner
to
leave
some
give
only
one
or
two
week
notice
leave
out
of
fear
for
the

take
twenty
eight

the
preeminence
of
goldman
sachs
have
be
built
out
of
a
multiplicity
of
skill
idea
and
world
change
ambition
and
drive
at
the
heart
of
it
all
have
always
be
the
ability
to
attract
and
keep
extraordinary
people
of
all
the
firm
s
competency
recruiting
must
be
the
most
consequential
as
john
whitehead
say
with
serene
conviction
if
you
don
t
have
the
best
people
you
can
t
be
the
best
firm
but
if
you
do
have
the
best
people
and
you
train
them
rigorously
organize
them
effectively
and
motivate
them
to
do
their
best
work
consistently
you
will
inevitably
become
the
best
firm
in
most
way
all
the
major
investment
banking
competitor
be
equal
all
firm
strive
to
serve
the
same
customer
all

building
all

the

and
they
all
know
each
other
and
can
quickly
copy
each
other
s
new

so
with
all
these
equalizer
how
can
any
firm
get
out
ahead
and
stay
out
ahead
there
be
only
four
way
to

significant
competitive

the

particularly
at

about

as
it
be
about
bring
in

up
the

tenenbaum
knew
where
to
turn
when
bill
bozniak
in
the
bond
department
refuse
to
have
anything
to

our
resell
to
good
customer
those
junk
bond
we
sometimes
have
to
take
into
inventory
to
accommodate
a
client
we
have
to
turn
to
michael
milken
of
drexel
burnham
to
find
a
market
just
like
everybody
else
with
all
wall
street
dealer
go
to
him
milken
soon
have
control
of
the
market
in
all
junk
issue
and
milken
knew
that
anyone
want
to
sell
junk
bond
need
him
and
his
bid
so
at
twenty
four
year
of
age
use
the
technique
of
analysis
invent
by
one
of
his
professor
at
wharton
milken
would
call
into
a
firm
like
goldman
sachs
and
say
i
know
you
have
a
big
position
you
want
to

and
we
both
know

can
t
so
i
ll
buy
half
a
million
at
milken
knew
his
offer
be
way
below
the
market
because
he
be
the
market
he
set
the
price
because
there
be
no
other
dealer
as
tenenbaum
reflect
milken
show
brilliance
in
how
well
he
knew
his
market
and
how
it
work
and
how
and
when
to
be
very
bold
tenenbaum
invite
milken
to
breakfast
but
first
he
checked
with
i
w
tubby
burnham
gu
levy

old

and
the

lambert
burnham
report
his
consider
judgment
on
milken
he
be
very
smart
but
he
have
larceny
in
his
soul
if
he
s
watch
he
can
be
a
real
winner
be
you
sure
you
want
to
offer
him
a
position
at
goldman
sachs
tenenbaum
say
we
can
watch
him
over
here
to
which
burnbaum
reply
well
you
well
watch
him
very
carefully
tenenbaum
arrange
to
make
milken
a
compelling
offer
the
firm
would
put
up
the
capital
and
he
would
get
a
good
salary
plus
participation
in
profit
share
whereby
select
nonpartner

a
special

this
be
an
unusually
powerful
offer
no
deal
say
milken
he
insist
on
two
thing
first
he
want
his
own
independent
department
and
second
he
want
to
pay
himself
percent
of
his
profit
no
way
would
we
do
that
say
tenenbaum
the
payout
be
way
too
big
and
we
knew
from
prior
experience
with
an
insurance

how
many
issue
and
argument
there
would
be

the

concept
that
be
rapidly
become
the
require
distinguish
characteristic
of
goldman
sachs
people
as
bob
conway
recall
john
whitehead
knew
that
recruiting
be
the
most
important
thing
we
could
ever
do
and
that
if
we
organize
sooner
and
well
and
work
at
it
harder
and
with
more
skill
we
could
identify
and
attract
well
people
more
often
and
if
we
do
this
consistently
we
would
build
a
well
and
well
organization
and
could
become
the
best
investment
banking
firm
in
america
and
in
the
world
as
john
put
it
and
he
really
meant
it
recruiting
be
the
most
important
thing
we
can
ever
do
and
if
we
ever
stop
do
recruiting
very
well
within
just
five
year
we
will
be
on
that
slippery
down
slope
doom
to
mediocrity
conway
get
memorable
proof
that
whitehead
meant
what
he
say
schedule
to
go
with
the
recruiting
team
to
stanford
business
school
when
an
urgent
matter
come
up
with
ford
motor
company
then
the
firm
s
most
important
client
conway
didn
t
know
what
to
do
so
he
go
to
whitehead
john
i
m
not
omniscient
and
i
m
not
able
to
be
omnipresent
which
do
you
want
me
to
do
stanford
or
ford
whitehead
didn
t
even
think
about
it
his
immediate
answer
go
to
stanford
i
ll
cover
for
you
at
ford
as
conway
say
it
s
choice
like
that
that

you
what
a

really
believe
in
and
it
be
decision
like
that
that
make
goldman
sachs
such
an
effective
recruiter
a
vital
factor
in
the
firm
s
commitment
to
recruiting
be
its
use
of
partner
to
do
the
work
when
conway

out

always
checked

we
take
so
long
to
make

with
our

process
that
some

that
as

i
be
the
thirty
second
person
to

a

who

that
all
the

have
experienced
about
this
absolute
tyro
be
all
part

by
far
the
most
aggressive

i
d
ever
see
even
more
surprising
to
me
that
extreme
behavior
be
normal
at

unrelenting
drive
to
get

evans
identify
the
potential
problem
the
one
possible
negative
of
our
approach
be
that
the
firm
have
less
tolerance
for
nonconformist
behavior
goldman
sachs
have
long
understood
the
strong
power
of

that
the
most
highly
talented

have
for

learn
that
be
explicit
about
its
high
standard
hard
work
long
hour
and
extensive
travel
can
be
a
powerful
positive
magnet
that
attracts
top
people
with
ambition
and
the
will
to
excel
particularly
if
they
believe
the
competition
to
get
ahead
be
and
will
always
be
fair
in
its
annual
review
for
the

we
will
continue
aggressively
to
recruit
the
best
people
to

that
they

this
be
a
major
investment

it
be
an
exceedingly
productive
one
of

there
be
a
flip
side
as
the
mba
career
guide
note
while
we
think
we
give
people
outstanding
opportunity
we
also
demand
much
from
them
our
people
work
long
hour
and
weekend
sometimes
in
very
pressure
situation
many
of

travel
a
great
deal
the
demand
of
the
job
often
require
them
to
make
personal
sacrifice
we
believe
we
get
an
unusual
degree
of
commitment
from
our

all
those
who

we
simply
do
not

soon
learn
they
could

explains
richard

partly
in
the

even
more
seriously
in

that
characterize

in
the

thing
on
my

tonight

not
quite
sure
what
if
anything
to
do
about
it
it
have
do
great
harm
to
some
of
our
competitor

could
do
serious
harm
to

what
worry
me
be
the
early
indication
of
a
serious
disease
that
can
be
quite
destructive
in
a
professional
service
firm
we
must
all
be
diligent
to
prevent
and
eradicate
it
here
at
our
firm
and
that
disease
have
a
name
we
don
t
like
to
use

we
must
it

arrogance
if
any
of
you
have
any
suggestion
at
any
time
on
how
we
can
prevent
arrogance
you
know
i
d
appreciate
your
help
who
would
like
to
start
this
important
discussion
one
hand
go
up

look
toward
the
young

and
what
can
you
suggest
we
do
john
there
s
one
really
effective
way
to
put
an

about
the

since

it
might
not
be

that
at
first
corzine
have
little
interest
in
develop
relationship

rapport
with
unfamiliar
corporate
client
but
since
he
be
always
an
astute
politician
it
be
surprising
that
he
give
so
little
thought
or
attention
to
the
new
executive
committee

to
its

after
a
satisfactory
first

the
strain
between
the
two

become
increasingly
obvious
corzine
have
to
elevate

one
of

inevitably
go

have
to
leave
explains
john

the
structure
be
inherently
unstable
especially
give
their
personality
his
decision
to
move
him
up
but
not
as
an
equal
just
set
the
stage
for
an
unhappy
outcome
no
formal
announcement

everyone
knew
corzine

the

toward
an

move
that

already

people
have
over

to
drop

long
have
complaint
from

that
in

the

that
they

the

lose
business
unnecessarily
with
the

mocked
as

lite

it
be
accepted
as
a
pragmatic
move
because
the

into
more

offer
a

all

he
stood
in

corzine
and
paulson
met
with
the
combine
operating

partner
committee
to
formally
propose
an

surprisingly
that
meeting
be
a
dud
even
though
these
senior
partner
would
have
the
most
to
gain
financially
they
be
still
oppose
without
their
support
an
ipo
would
never
be
approve
by
the
whole
partnership
but
in
his
drive
to
take
the
firm
public
corzine
have
already
put
an
ipo
on
the
agenda
for
the
forthcoming
meeting
of
all
partner
which
be
now
only
two
week
away
at
arrowwood
in
rye
new
york
as
arrowwood
approach
corzine
face
impressive
opposition
from
within
his
successor
as
chief
financial
officer
john
thain
highly
respect
within
the
partnership
for
his
rational
brilliance
and
his
unemotional
objective
judgment
be
clearly
oppose
to
an
ipo
paulson
and
thornton
support
thain
s
position
so
the
executive
committee
be
split
three
to
three
this
be
not
a
good
sign
in
addition
eric
dobkin
the
firm
s
expert
on
pricing
large
global
equity
underwritings
say
he
believe
that
because
so
much
of
the
firm
s
profit
come
from
trading
an
ipo
would
be
price
at
well
under

book
value
a
big
discount
from
morgan
stanley

three

book
value
while
others
include
member

sharply
disagreed
dobkin
held
his
ground
his
low
estimate
valuation
deflate
the
affirmative
case
at
the
individual
partner
level
leave
far
too
little
pressure
to
help
corzine
override
the
traditional
spiritual
concern
about
protect
the
soft
value
of
the
partnership
that
be
important
in
recruiting
exceptional
people
ensure
client
confidence
and
govern
operation
still
corzine
plow
ahead
when
the

held
its

two

meeting
at

in
january
on
friday
he
present
a
detailed
capital
structure
analysis
and
the
logical
case
for
an

he
intend
to
put
the
decision
through
at
the
saturday
session
and
be
lay
the
groundwork
for
the
let

go
presentation
he
would
be
give
exceedingly
political
an
apt
adumbration
of
his
second
career
as
senator
and
governor
corzine
pull
literally
every
partner
aside
for
private
personal
politick
for
an

and
make
a
continuous
point
of
know
the
pulse
of
the
partnership
all
the
time
through
dinner
and
after
dinner
he
work
to
connect
with
partner
particularly
those
from
overseas
office
that
he
didn
t
see
so
often
as
the
partner
discussion
of
an
ipo
continued
it
be
increasingly
clear
that
corzine
while
work
hard
to
develop
support
all
day
friday
would
not
have
as
much
as
he
need
on
saturday
this
be
confirm
when
the

held
a
long

they
express
a
clear
consensus
on

later
at

morning
but
he
knew
he
couldn
t
simply
advocate
go
ahead
with
the
ipo
that
would
not
fly
so
what
could
he
say
and
do
to
strike
the
right
tone
corzine
and
neustein
quickly
discuss
what
to

how
to

and
what
not

on
a
yellow

out
an
outline
for
his
talk
with
a
few
key
phrase
an
introduction
and
a
closing
line
when
he
get
to
the
meeting
room
corzine
found
that
the
young
partner
have
organize
their
opposition
one
after
another
they
spoke
out
against
an
ipo
after
an
hour
corzine
go
to
the
podium
and
deliver
the
astonish
message
he
and
neustein
have
craft
say
there
will
be
no
ipo
the
ipo
be
off
the
table
it
s
over
he
get
it
right
for
the
first
time
in
the
firm
s
history
the
partner
all
rise
and
give
their
manage
partner
a
stand
ovation
in
the
day
that
follow
congratulatory
letter
pour
in
we
re
so
proud
of
you
i
never

than
i
do
now
thanks
to
you
you
be
and
be
a
great
leader
but
those
who
knew
corzine
best
knew
the
ipo
be
not
over
although
he
couldn
t
force
the
issue
he
wasn
t
about
to
give
up
corzine
may
have
lose
that
particular
round
even
without
a
formal
vote
but
in
his
long
term
campaign
he
have
make
important
gain
and
almost
everybody
come
to
sense
it
everyone
want
to
be
certain
to
stay
for
the
big
bonanza
to
protect
their
own
position
in
the
firm
and
get
rich
explain
one
of
the
old
partner
everyone
go
on
the
defensive
the
whole
firm
seem
to
slow
down
while
everyone
rubbed
everybody
s
back
and
held
on
to
their
position
this
be
terribly
frustrate
to
the
low
rank
people
who
want
to
get
ahead
while
fail
to
win
a
commitment
for
an
ipo
corzine
have
successfully
change
the
topic
of
public
ownership
from
not
discussable
to
openly
and
fully
discussable
this
have
an
accumulate
influence
in
favor
of

ahead
because
more
and
more
partner
be
recognize
the
importance
of
permanent
capital
for
the
firm
and
because
on
a
personal
level
the
dual
desire
once
unleashed
for
great
wealth
and
for
the
power
that
come
with

which
have
be
so
strong
steadily
dissipate
and
the
power
of
tradition
become
less
and
less
meaningful
the
fact
that
a

have
work
so
well
in
the
past
with
a
small
closer

that
didn

really

of
its

the

for
the

so
it
really
wasn

fair

that
all
that

should
go
to
the

bestowing
all
that

on

meant
take
something
away
from
the

it
would
weaken
the

that
be
now
so
important
to
its
success
to
those
who
felt
this
way
an
ipo
would
inevitably
rob
the

it
might
not

right
away
but
it
would
surely
do

john

write
a

not
go

read

aloud
to
the

it
be
obviously
deeply

they

both
highly

but
their
era
have
pass
they
be
no
longer
the

they
have
once
be

the
center
of
gravity
of
their

already
behind
the

and
every
month
that
reality
be
become
clearer
to
more
partner
whitehead
be
ask
year
later
why
he
and

as
experienced
investment
banker
who
must
have
see
many
other
long

the
situation

that

why
we

never

the

still
loom
on
the

young
people
eager
to

the

about

it
be

to
go

go

laid
it
out
quietly

clearly
the

never

they

not

one

their

silfen
be

exact
while
corzine
be
open
comfortable
with

and
a

taker
silfen
may
have
have
some
hope
that
corzine
would
ask
him
to
stay
and
perhaps
even
offer
him
a
special
incentive
to
do
so
but
corzine
didn
t
rise
to
the

he
simply
say
he
understood
you

have
a

david
it

your

not
a

silfen
s
part
would
have
little
immediate
significance
to
corzine
but
it
would
lead
almost
inevitably
to
corzine
s
be
force
out
as
manage

the

make
the

the

very

the
irony
would
be
that
the
stress
generate
by

unrelenting
drive
to
complete
the

be
a

a

easy
not

it

every

ltcm
trader
want
to
unwind
a

so
too
do
many
like
mind
hedge

and
dealer
market
liquidity
depends
on
difference
of
opinion
among
many
different
buyer
and
many
different
seller
the
more
difference
the
well
for
liquidity
when
investor
agree
whether
rationally
or
emotionally
on
what
be
the
right
market
direction
liquidity
quickly
evaporates
strong
agreement
on
market
direction
particularly
strong
emotional
agreement
can
produce
a
stampede
that
quickly
destroys
liquidity
ltcm
s
computer
model
make
no
provision
for
change
in
market
liquidity
particularly
a
sudden
and
unexpected
evaporation
of
liquidity
volatility
or
market
risk
be
roughly
the
opposite
of
what
the
most
active
investor
and
trader
usually
mean
by
quality
most
investor
dislike
price
volatility
so
they
would
prefer
to
offload
it
they
can
for
a
price
and
others
will
for
a
price
accept
or
buy
volatility
volatility
cannot
be
bought
or
sell
directly
but
volatility
can
be
bought
or
sell
indirectly
by
sell
short
or
buying
stock
index
future
or
to
get
even
great
leverage
buying
or
sell
option
on
stock
index
future
volatility
be
usually
mispriced
because
since
most
investor
dislike
market
risk
they
be
quite
willing
to
sell
volatility
at
less
than
its
mathematical
fair
value
because
they
be
effectively
buying
insurance
against
market
risk
future
and
option
on
future
will
usually
move
away
from
their
normal
trading
range
when
investor
collectively
either
fear
a
market
decline
or
hope
for
a
rise
the
more
pervasive
the
hope
or
fear
the
great
the
distance
from
normal
pricing
for
market
volatility
which
trader
call
vol
ltcm
could
therefore
effectively
buy
or
sell
vol
by
trading
in
stock
index
future
and
this
become
a
major
part
of
its
portfolio
operation
as
investor
react
to
the
surprising
russian
default
scramble
out
of
the
unusual
illiquid
security
that
ltcm
specialized
in
they
sell
what
ltcm
own
long
and
bought
what
ltcm
have
sell
short
that
drove
market
price
far
and
far
away
from
the
normal
price
correlation
that
ltcm
s
computer
model
have
use
to
identify
the
anomaly
that
ltcm
have
be
so
successfully
exploit
in
its
highly
leveraged
portfolio
suddenly
everything
be
different
now
the
market
be
go
strongly
against
ltcm
and
while
its
portfolio
be
wonderfully
diversified
in
many
many
way
it
have
no
diversification
against
the
one
risk
of
a
worldwide
simultaneous
flight
to
quality
with
investor
shun
more
speculative
security
and
that
flight
to
quality
be
become
a
stampede
and
trample
ltcm
corzine
knew
that
the
trader
at
goldman
sachs
have
large
exposure
to
the
same
kind
of
complex
derivative
base
portfolio
position
that
meriwether
and
his
crew
at
ltcm
have
be
establish
in
recent
week
corzine
also
knew
because
goldman
sachs
be
believe
to
watch
ltcm
closely
and
allegedly
often
match
ltcm
s
trade
in
the
firm
s
own
proprietary
portfolio
that
the
spread
trade
ltcm
always
like
to
do
have
be
go
very
much
in
the
wrong
direction
corzine
knew
too
about
ltcm
s
large
leverage
bold
investor
might
borrow
half
the
money
they
invest
so
they
would
have
percent
leverage
and
percent
equity
hedge
fund
often
borrow
more
reach
as
much
as
percent
or
very
temporarily
even
percent
leverage
but
at
ltcm
meriwether
and
his
group
be
borrowing
much
more
the
equity
wasn
t
percent
or
even
percent
it
be
a
mere
percent
ltcm
be
use
leverage
with
a
vengeance
with
percent
equity
a
loss
of
just
percent
in
its
total
portfolio
would
completely
wipe
out
ltcm
phenomenally
secretive
ltcm
have
irritated
wall
street
in
its
first
few
year
of

by
refuse
to
inform
its

its

about
any
of
its
internal
operation
in
a
world
that
increasingly
insist
on
transparency
ltcm
arrogantly
insist
on
be
opaque
so
when
meriwether
have
a
serious
markdown
and
felt
oblige
to
step
outside
his
closely
guard
realm
of
secrecy
to
call
one
of
his
major
dealer
and
financial
backer
at
home
early
in
the
morning
corzine
knew
that
the
situation
be
serious
no
matter
what
verbal
assurance
j
m
be
give
if
he
d
know
at
the
outset
that
meriwether
be
call
from
beijing
where
he
have
excuse
himself
from
a
dinner
party
to
make
the
call
and
have
just
book
himself
on
the
next
flight
home
corzine
would
have
know
that
the
situation
at
ltcm
be
very
serious
as
the
worldwide
flight
to
quality
gain
momentum
and
spread
to
more
and
more
market
arbitrage
trader
who
work
in
the
same
market
space
as
ltcm
get
increasingly
aggressive
at
cut
back
their
position
particularly
those
position
that
trader
knew
be
similar
to
ltcm
s
and
so
want
to
get
out
of
first
some
be
act
on
their
senior
management
order
to
cut
back
and
some
have
to
reduce
their
position
because
they
be
receive
margin
call
from
their
bank
suddenly
all
the
sophisticated
trader
want
to
sell
none
want
to
buy
and
they
be
sell
their
well
quality
more
liquid
position
not
because
they
want
to
they
didn
t
but
for
one
decisive
reason
they
have
to
sell
the
quality
stuff
to
raise
cash
because
nothing
else
could
be
sell
into
that
suddenly
anxious
market
in
a
normal
rational
market
ltcm
s
highly
diversified
carefully
hedge
position
would
have
be
smart
bet
against
a
series
of
temporary
pricing
anomaly
in
a
normal
rational
market
ltcm
would
have
go
right
on
make
million
by
vacuum
up
all
those
nickel
and
dime
but
ltcm
s
portfolio
have
two
eventually
critical
problem
in
every
long
short
pair
ltcm
always
own
the
low
quality
security
and
be
short
the
high
quality
security
and
most
of
its
pairing
involve
complex
trade
in
small
unusual
market
where
liquidity
be
always
limited
and
could
as
be
now
be
prove
be
very
limited
against
the
one
specific
risk
of
investor
everywhere
drive
their
portfolio
toward
high
quality
and
go
against
ltcm
s
clever
position
there
be
no
hedge
and
no
useful
diversification
instead
of
superb
diversification
in
ltcm
s
portfolio
suddenly
everything
be
strongly
correlate
suddenly
there
be
virtually
no
liquidity
for
the
unusual
low
grade
security
ltcm
own
most
of
course
give
sufficient
time
the
market
and
its
price
would
eventually
and
inevitably
become
rational
but
as
john
maynard
keynes
have
warn
long
ago
market
can
remain
irrational
longer
than
you
can
remain
solvent
when
they
really
need
to
sell
seller
don
t
choose
the
price
buyer
do
a
buyer
market
be
exactly
what
ltcm
do
not
want
when
thing
go
badly
the
smart
borrower
doesn
t
wait
for
the
lender
to
call
the
smart
borrower
always
make
the
first
call
so
john
meriwether
call
his
major
banker
jon
corzine
at
goldman
sachs
we
ve
have
a
serious
markdown
but
everything
be
fine
with
us
the
word
be
reassure
so
be
the
tone
of
voice
but
they
always
be
when
the
very
calm
understated
and
self
contain
and
private
caller
be
john
meriwether
j
m
be
always
calm
and
always
understated
so
his
calmness
this
particular
morning
meant
absolutely
nothing
corzine
have
enough
experience
and
ample
reason
to
know
well
than
to
feel
reassure
by
meriwether
s
call
first
the
early
morning
call
be
not
to
his
office
it
be
to
his
home
second
it
be
starkly
out
of
character
for
the
secretive
meriwether
to
say
anything
about
ltcm
s
portfolio
particularly
anything
as
blatantly
negative
as
we
ve
have
a
serious
markdown
as
a
long
experienced
bond
dealer
who
have
make
a

billion
of

of

other
people
didn
t
want
corzine
be
sensitive
to

particularly
any
unusual

unexpected

and
meriwether
be
send
a
soft
subtle
but
very
unusual
very
unexpected
and
therefore
clearly
significant
signal
corzine
and
meriwether
be
contemporary
knew
each
other
well
have
great
respect
for
each
other
as
major
dealer
and
understood
market
and
deal
in
similar
way
they
held
similar
belief
about
the
change
nature
of
the
world
s
capital
market
and
the
increasingly
attractive
opportunity
for
highly
profitable
principal
proprietary

particularly
in
fix
income
arbitrage
operation
both
men
be
unpretentious
midwesterners

comfortable
within
themselves
and
both
men
be
determine
to
win
on
a
giant

corzine
call
meriwether
back
because
he
want
to
know
more
a
lot
more
he
match
meriwether
s
calmness
with
his
own
instead
of
say
j
m
you
ve
be
way
too
secretive
i
know
you

you

get

it

meriwether
both
knew
the
essential
reality
of
the
situation
ltcm
be
no
longer
in
control
it
would
have
to
change
its
way
arrogant
secrecy
be
over
a
thing
of
the
past
now
ltcm
would
have
to
share
important
information
with
its
creditor
and
that
meant
the
creditor
would
learn
thing
their

could
use
to
trade
against
ltcm
inevitably
make
the

serious
it

with

obvious
advantage

goldman

in

goldman
sachs
would
not
only
own
half
of
ltcm

company
but
also
set
limit
on
ltcm

tantamount
to
take
full
control
of

get
complete
knowledge

which
goldman
sachs
could
then
use

the

be
conditional
on
goldman
sachs
s
deliver
the

infusion
and
on
an
examination
of

so
both

begin

through
ltcm

immediately
any

of

require
approval

the

maximum

kept
its
long
trade

its
short

at
separate

since
the

could
not
be
sure
the
hedge
be
correctly

they
have
require
somewhat
more

the
absolute

if
the

each

up
at
the

that
extra

could
be

and
the
financial
squeeze
would
be
relaxed
fine
in
concept
but
as
always
the
devil
would
be
in
the
detail
ltcm
do
not
run
a
simple
business
it
use
extraordinary
diversification
to
minimize
the
risk
of
any
one
position
or
specific
group
of
position
go
sour
as
a
result
ltcm
have
thirty
eight
thousand
different

position
with
every

carefully
separate
and
each
side

at
a

match
up
all
those

so
ltcm

also
short

the
major

nobody
in

the

plan
assume
that
sixteen
bank
would
each
commit
million
but
when
several
bank
refuse
to
go
that
high
it
be
clear
that
the
major
would
each
have
to
go
up
even
high
to
million
apiece
corzine
the
only
ceo
who
be
also
an
experienced

have
want
to
play
the
essential
leadership
role
but
his

be
less
caught
up
in
the
time
urgency
of
endorse
the

strategy
and
be
much
more
concerned
about
the

risk
to

sachs
they
make
this
clear
in

which
thain
then

without
the
approval
of
his
executive
committee
which
have
only
very
reluctantly
authorize

he
certainly
didn
t
have
his

authorization
for
an
additional
million
consider
himself
essentially
the
ceo
of
a
major

and
an
expert
in

and
bond
trading
corzine
found
it
embarrass
to

recent

and
the
accumulate

what

improvisation
be
just
be
sloppy
paulson
and

be
never
good
at
work
together
they
didn
t
really
like
each

just
disagree
they

like
teenage
kid
recall
zuckerberg
who
have
warn
his
friend
corzine
during
those
un
plaza
meeting
to
others
on
the

it
seem
that
paulson
and
corzine
argue
all
the
time
often
quite
bitterly
partner
go
to
zuckerberg
and
say
can
t
you
help
you
know
both
guy
and
they
both
trust
you
during
one
executive
committee
meeting
it
get
so
bad
close
to
throw
punch
that
zuckerberg
decide
he
have
to
do
something
so
he
make
paulson
and
corzine
stay
behind
close
the
door
and
say
firmly
you
must
work
this
out
it
will
hurt
the
firm
if
you
keep
it
up
paulson
s
accumulate
frustration
be
so
wide
and
deep
that
he
nearly
left
in
late
but
be
persuade
to
stay
the
committee
spent
one
whole
weekend
try
to
find
way
to
work
it
out
in
may
corzine
offer
that
they
should
work
as
co
ceo
after
all
zuckerberg
say
tartly
you
two
show
you
can
really
work
together
for
just
six
month
and
then
i
ll
support
your
idea
look
back
zuckerberg
lament
corzine
as
senior
partner
and
paulson
as
president
one
a
partnership
title
and
the
other
a
corporate
title
make
no
sense
it
be
cockamamie
when
corzine
say
let
s
go
co
it
s
fine
with
me
i
don
t
give
a
damn
he
be
wrong
wrong
to
think
they
could
work
together
and
wrong
about
paulson
still
the
committee
decide
to
accept
corzine
and
paulson
s
commitment
to
try
to
work
together
that
same
spring
the
firm
decide
to
launch
the
initial
public
offering
in
the
fall
but
market
turbulence
originate
with
russia
s
financial
crisis
compel
a
postponement
the
conclusion
that
corzine
have
to
go
be
not
base
on
any
one
thing
one
part
of
the
jigsaw
puzzle
be
structural
corzine
s
decision
to
maintain
a
six
member
executive
committee
rather
than
a
large
management
committee
and
then
ignore
advice
to
let
silfen
and
then
zuckerberg
go
limited
without
add
strong
loyal
supporter
of
his
own
choose
onto
the
committee
another
be
his
treat
the
executive
committee
as
not
all
that
important
and
act
like
an
all
powerful
freewheel
ceo
the
others
on
the
executive
committee
believe
the
committee
be
the
ultimate
power
in
the
partnership
and
that
all
decision
make
rest
with
that
committee
on
behalf
of
the
partner
a
third
piece
of
the
puzzle
corzine
be
so
confident
of
strong
support
across
the
large
partnership
that
he
somehow
didn
t
recognize
that
broad
support
could
be
trumped
by
the
small
executive
committee
he
have
be
lose
support
in
the
committee
and
should
have
know
it
have
the
power
if
it
want
to
to
take
him
out
not
simply
out
of
be
senior
partner
and
chairman
of
the
management
committee
but
right
out
of
the
partnership
itself
abort
the
ipo
in
september
after
announce
it
just
three
month
before
have
be
embarrass
particularly
to
the
firm
s
investment
banker
more
pungently
postpone
the
ipo
after
show
individual
exactly
how
much
money
they
would
make
be
certainly
disconcert
to
the
owner
additional
manage
director
and
employee
who
would
each
have
benefit
moreover
goldman
sachs
have
lose
nearly
billion
in
trading
often
in
position
similar
to
those
that
take
down
ltcm
be
professionally
humiliate
to
many
at
the
firm
tension
between
the
firm
s
banker
and
trader
be
heighten
when
trading
loss
suddenly
wipe
away
the
distributable
profit
of
a
record
surge
in
banking
fee
an
important
component
of
the
case
against
corzine
come
from
the
personal
decision
of
individual
committee
member
in
david
silfen
have
decide
he
wasn
t
go
to
be
make

wasn

really
interested
in

already
do
all
he
could
do
to
build
trading
into
a
highly
profitable
power
center
so
other
than
loyalty
to
the
firm
and
to
individual
partner
he
saw
no
real
reason
to
stay
as
a
trader
silfen
have
an
understand
of
the
business
that
be
similar
to
corzine

so
even
though
they
have
limited
personal
rapport
the
two
men
usually
have
similar
view
on
key
decision
and
silfen
almost
always
vote
with
corzine
similarly
zuckerberg

close
rapport
with
corzine
and
regularly
support
him
on

even

nobody
thought

in
less
than
a
year
he
also
offer
some
advice
jon
we
ve
be
friend
for
a
long
time
please
take
some
advice
from
a
friend

to
put
some
of
your
own
people
on
the

okay
jon
you
really
should
think
about
it
they

take
by
john
thornton
corzine

appoint
thornton

to
some
a
good
relationship

the
reality
be
more
complex
thornton
oppose
an
ipo
which
he
saw
as
only
one
hand
clap
he
felt
that
go
public
would
inevitably
lead
to
a
megamerger
with
a
major
commercial
bank
and
that
the
firm
would
be
fall
into
the
old
trap
of
take
bold
action
before
it
have
developed
an
overall
strategy
when
zuckerberg

to
send
him
as
one
of
my

to

and
he
felt
the
first
priority
in
select
a

should
be
strong
leadership
above
all
else

one
percent
of
the
time
on
the
really
big
issue
i
ll
insist
on
the
formal
governance
mechanism
in
the
partnership
agreement
and
vote
as
one
of
six
as
we
all
should
okay
understood
not
a
problem
for
a

for
so
many
year
to
develop

such
a

a
waste

until
the

be
complete
to

at

the

then

leave
the

he
have

corzine
have
no

group

there
be
not

explain
if
the

put
to
the

corzine
would
never
have
lose
his
position
he
be

popular

many
loyal

in
the
small
group
when
he
wasn
t
look
he
could
be
and
be
blindside
it
be
like
living
the
history
of
imperial
rome
corzine
have
tear
in
his
eye
when
told
the
surprise
of
a
lifetime
but
he
played
it
out
like
a

the

paulson

thornton
believe
those

by
the

blithely
call
the

inaccurate
in

paulson
go
on
to

get
investment
management
right
one
of
the
most
profitable
discussion
in
the
history
of
goldman
sachs
take
place
over
several
week
in
between
hank
paulson
and
john
mcnulty
the
essence
of
the
strategy
that
they
developed
can
be
evoke
by
a
simple
analogy
the
lovely
eight
to
ten
foot
tree
we
use
to
decorate
our
home
at
christmas
would
take
twenty
year
to
grow
from
seed
but
the
one
we
buy
be
only
six
or
seven
year
old
young
sprig
be
graft
into
stump
with
extensive
well
establish
root
structure
that
provide
so
much
nutrition
that
the
sprout
develop
and
grow
super
rapidly
into
full
tree
mcnulty
who
have
be
consult
with
goldman
sachs
asset
management
while
on
leave
from
the
firm
to
recover
from
an
early
age
heart
attack
convince
paulson
that
graft
gsam
s
invest
onto
goldman
sachs
s
powerful
distribution
would
produce
rapid
growth
in
asset
manage
and
strong
almost
riskless
growth
in
profit
paulson
assign
mcnulty
to
work
in
gsam
with
his
friend
david
ford
thing
change
quickly
at
gsam
because
ford
and
mcnulty
be
give
important
advantage
compare
to
their
predecessor
a
decisive
advantage
be
an
agreement
that
their
business
success
would
be
measure
on
the
basis
of
the
market
value
of
asset
brought
under
management
that
be
on
gsam
s
capacity
to
generate
future
earnings
not
on
current
report
earnings
i
have
an
epiphany
say
mcnulty
that
the
correct
way
to
measure
the
economic
value
of
gsam
be
not
current
profit
but
accumulate
asset
under
management
from
which
future
profit
and
future
growth
in
profit
could
be
harvest
traditionally
at
goldman
sachs
each
line
of
business
no
matter
how
complex
its
inner
working
be
always
evaluate
on
a
simple
standard
do
you
make
money
today
for
the
partnership
that
s
the
way
it
be
and
have
always
be
with
traditional
wall
street
partnership
but
that
s
not
the
way
it
be
in
other
business
such
as
oil
and
gas
exploration
life
insurance
and
annuity
and
investment
management
in
each
of
these
business
the
first
year
of
a
major
success
appear
to
be
a
loser
the
only
way
to
understand
these
business
be
to
use
managerial
accounting
that
recognizes
the
present
value
of
the
long
term
increase
in
the
economic
value
of
drilling
hole
create
customer
or
building
a
franchise
that
will
produce
many
year
of
future
earnings
fortunately
for
gsam
and
for
goldman
sachs
paulson
like
and
trust
mcnulty
enough
to
listen
carefully
to
his
reason
have
watch
m
a
banker
sell
asset
management
firm
to
financial
behemoth
for
surprisingly
high
valuation
relative
to
earnings
paulson
be
ready
to
recognize
that
mcnulty
and
ford
have
come
to
a
crucial
understand
about
the
best
way
to
manage
gsam
gsam
s
value
be
not
current
profit
but
the
accumulation
of
asset
under
management
change
the
whole
concept
of
how
to
measure
success
get
strong
confirmation
from
an
unlikely
source
the
investment
banking
division
goldman
sachs
have
be
involve
as
adviser
and
banker
in
acquisition
of
several
asset
management
firm
and
have
learn
how
and
why
the
market
value
them
so
highly
this
understand
be
key
to
the
transformation
in
measure
result
and
accountability
that
would
enable
mcnulty
and
ford
to
transform
gsam
and
its
business
it
meant
that
there
would
be
no
basis
for
complaint
and
it
might
even
be
best
for
the
firm
in
the
long
run
if
the
gsam
business
be
run
at
only
breakeven
for
several
year
provide
it
be
add
substantial
asset
under
management
with
profit
come
from
a
captive
fee
base
business
the
stock
market
and
debt
rating
agency
would
value
those
reliably
recur
profit
far
more
highly
dollar
for
dollar
than
trading

or
banking

when
they
take
over
from
steve
friedman
in
jon
corzine
and
hank
paulson
be
determine
to
decide
once
and
for
all
what
to
do
with
gsam
and
how
to
do
it
by
agreement
paulson
would
concentrate
on
improve
internal
operation
while
corzine
focus
on
make
acquisition
paulson
like
and
trust
mcnulty
and
listen
carefully
to
what
he
have
to
say
because
he
knew
mcnulty
be
a
smart
conceptual
aggressive
entrepreneurial
realist
mcnulty
say
of
corzine
and
paulson
they
didn
t
really
understand
the
investment
business
but
they
ask
all
sort
of
question
and
their
focus
give
us
energy
for
success
after
start
out
in

mcnulty

move
from

to

consistently
in

consistently
successful
he
spent
hour
and
hour
with
paulson
explain
the
nature
of
gsam
s
business
and
how
it
could
be
convert
into
a
real
success
the
argument
that
the
rating
agency
be
more
interested
in
a

of

than
an

the
people
make
the

a
small
minority
among

most
of

do
not
and
could
not

the

the

about

vie
for
each
account
they
weren
t
about
to
stop
or
cut
back
on
use
their
most
important
block
trading
firm
to
reduce
the
competition
by
just
one
investment
manager
and
their
senior
executive
when
push
come
to
shove
would
not
ask
or
tell
them
to
do
so
so
they
bluffed
and
issue
warning
but
the
penalty
rarely
come
through
and
never
last
the
firm
have
always
treat
a
dollar
earn
in
asset
management
as
no
well
and
no
bad
than
a
dollar
earn
in
trading
underwriting
arbitrage
or
stockbrokerage
yet
even
investment
management
firm
that
earn
only
moderate
profit
have
market
valuation
twenty
to
twenty
five

worth
only
five

word
the

value
of
a

of

five
time
the
market
value
of
the
same
dollar
earn
in
a
trading
business
the
obvious
imperative
be
to
get
control
of
asset
ideally
by
acquisition
of
capable
investment
unit
and
then
apply
the

we
have
some
pretty
sophisticated
expertise
in
risk
analysis
and
risk
management
and
show
them
how
they
could
cut
back
any
unnecessary
risk
in
their
portfolio
third
we
would
give
them
the
security
and
confidence
of
have
a
major
organization
behind
them
which
enable
them
to
focus
on
their
true
passion
invest
indirectly
we
would
also
help
them
stay
organizationally
discipline
because
we
have
a
big
stick
in
our
hand
gsam
have
the
option
write
right
into
the
contract
to
bring
everybody
at
liberty
from
tampa
to
new
york
if
thing
at
liberty
didn
t
run
smoothly
but
get
the
final
agreement
sign
be
not
easy
herb
ehlers
threaten
to
abort
the
deal
after
he
saw
draft
legal
document
the
lawyer
work
for
goldman
sachs
may
have
know
contract
and
acquisition
law
very
well
but
he
overplayed
his
hand
in
write
the
term
because
he
didn
t
understand
the
key
to
successful
merger
and
acquisition
in
a
service
business
trust
between
the
key
principal
goldman
sachs
s
banker
on
the
deal
have
let
the
lawyer
take
control
of
the
contract
and
the
lawyer
write
every
part
of
the
merger
agreement
to
gsam
s
advantage
item
for
item
the
result
be
different
from
what
ehlers
thought
be
accepted
understanding
think
gsam
be
try
to
pull
a
fast
one
on
him
ehlers
get
angry
and
at
least
as
much
in
sadness
as
in
anger
declare
the
deal
be
off
after
week
of
negotiation
mcnulty
have
gotten
to
know
ehlers
well
and
sense
there
be
something
not
yet
settle
somewhere
somehow
he
just
knew
there
be
a
way
to
save
the
deal
but
what
could
it
be
of
course
say
mcnulty
to
himself
it
s
yom
kippur
in
draw
his
line
in
the
sand
ehlers
knew
that
berlinski
the
partner
from
the
investment
banking
division
who
be
supervise
the
deal
would
be
unavailable
because
he
would
be
at
temple
so
gsam
wouldn
t
have
its
expert
work
in
between
the
two
principal
mcnulty
and
ehlers
would
be
on
their
own
to
mcnulty
that
show
how
savvy
ehlers
must
be
since
he
s
that
smart
we
have
to
win
this
deal
because
a
guy
that
smart
could
be
a
control
player
for
the
future
of
gsam
mcnulty
go
to
corzine
and
explain
the
whole
picture
but
corzine
didn
t
get
it
he
try
to
calm
mcnulty
down
say
you
win
some
and
you
lose
some
we
ll
be
okay
but
mcnulty
couldn
t
calm
down
he
quickly
go
to
paulson
next
and
say
let
s
catch
the
seven
a
m
flight
out
of
newark
paulson
agree
and
when
they
get
to
tampa
they
swung
into
action
make
the
strong
pitch
they
could
herb
have
the
contract
in
front
of
him
and
we
could
see
he
have
lot
of
mark
on
it
page
after
page
our
only
hope
be
to
go
through
it
item
by
item
as
ehlers
identify
item
he
didn
t
like
mcnulty
would
ask
what
would
you
like
herb
item
by
item
ehlers
say
what
he
want
and
thought
have
be
agree
item
by
item
paulson
say
one
word
do
paulson
say
that
one
word
a
dozen
different
time
do
do
do
after
all
the
marked
item
be
resolve
ehlers
say
we
ll
go
into
another
room
and
discus
among
ourselves
all
you
ve
say
and
then
we
ll
vote
after
half
an
hour
s
discussion
ehlers
s
colleague
come
out
smile
they
have
vote
yes
the
next
priority
be
to
make
it
clear
to
everyone
at
liberty
that
while
they
all
could
remain
in
florida
gsam
be
in
charge
mcnulty
recall
how
he
do
this
i
told
the
guy
at
liberty
they
could
stay
in
florida
but
that
i
have
a
big
inventory
of
warm
winter
coat
in
a
big
closet
and
if
performance
ever
go
south
and
stayed
there
i
be
go
to
send
those
coat
to
tampa
because
they
be
all
come
north
to
stay
naturally
this
make
it
very
clear
to
everyone
that
they
well
produce
consistently
good
performance
number
and
the
result
of
this
enforce
discipline
be
great
for
them
and
great
for
us
when
the
acquisition
s
final
closing
be
only
one
week
away
ford
call
ehlers
to
say
it
s
important
that
we
all
agree
on
one
thing
there
s
only
one
franchise
or
brand
and
only
one
vision
for
our
future
together
on
the
day
after
the
closing
i
ll
call
your
office
and
there
be
only
two
possible
way
for
your
folk
to
answer
goldman
sachs
or
goldman
sachs
asset
management
and
you
ll
want
to
print
some
business
card
not
many
but
some
with
liberty
in
big
letter
and
goldman
sachs
in
small
type
right
under
it
and
then
we
ll
switch
to
some
card
with
goldman
sachs
in
the
large
type
and
liberty
under
that
in
small
type
and
then
we
ll
switch
to
new
card
and
you
ll
want
lot
of
these
with
only
goldman
sachs
asset
management
always
remember
herb
we
be
the
brand
a
few
day
later
when
ehlers
be
at
goldman
sachs
s
office
in
new
york
city
ford
walk
him
over
to
the
large
picture
window
with
a
great
view
of
low
manhattan
look
south
toward
the
outer
harbor
and
say
look
out
this
window
and
tell
me
what
you
see
the
river
the
ferry
the
statue
of
liberty
and
brooklyn
why
keep
your
eye
on
brooklyn
that
s
the
objective
i
ll
find
a
way
to
get
you
over
there
ferry
tunnel
helicopter
you
keep
your
focus
entirely
on
brooklyn
and
don
t
even
look
at
the
river
the
message
be
clear
liberty
should
focus
on
invest
while
gsam
accumulate
asset
through
sell
a
few
year
later
another
round
of
negotiation
developed
over
liberty
s
five
year
payouts
ehlers
call
mcnulty
i
ve
be
look
again
at
the
earn
out
and
i
realize
it
s
not
fair
we
ve
do
great
work
in
recent
year
but
if
our
part
of
the
market
growth
stock
suddenly
go
against
us
we
ll
come
up
short
on
performance
and
our
investor
will
disappear
we
could
be
hurt
badly
by
some
fluke
in
the
stock
market
sound
bad
to
me
too
tell
you
what
herb
you
re
a
proprietor
you
ve
sell
liberty
once
before
and
then
bought
it
back
so
you
study
the
whole
situation
and
if
you
can
come
up
with
a
fair
rearrangement
we
ll
do
it
in
the
end
ehlers
work
out
a
well
buyback
deal
than
mcnulty
ever
could
have
propose
mcnulty
return
the
favor
i
do
suggest
that
they
take
percent
in
goldman
sachs
stock
they
agree
and
that
work
very
well
goldman
sachs
stock
double
and
then
double
again
by
the
original
deal
for
goldman
sachs
to
buy
liberty
be
do
in
when
liberty
have
billion
in
asset
under
management
ten
year
later
asset
under
management
be
at
billion
and
rise
because
gsam
have
such
strong
distribution
gsam
have
paid
million
for
liberty
after
a
decade
of
strong
asset
buildup
the
buyback
by
ehlers
s
group
value
it
at
over
billion
gsam
be
look
for
more
of
the
same
and
found
a
likely
target
in
rosenberg
capital
management
rcm
one
of
the
finer
investment
firm
on
the
west
coast
claude
rosenberg
be
surprised
when
berlinski
the
goldman
sachs
banker
manage
the
intend
sale
of
his
investment
management
firm
suddenly
go
from
be
his
agent
to
be
a
principal
say
we
might
be
interested
in
buying
your
firm
for
goldman
sachs
this
again
raise
all
the
classic
question
about
conflict
of
interest
but
rosenberg
decide
to
go
ahead
with
discussion
with
gsam
for
gsam
it
soon
developed
the
underlie
problem
with
acquire
rcm
be
business
fit
rcm
have
a
small
international
investment
product
that
it
really
want
to
continue
but
goldman
sachs
be
already
a
well
establish
international
investment
bank
with
office
in
every
major
country
and
significant
research
be
do
on
all
the
major
economy
and
most
of
the
major
corporation
from
its
regional
headquarters
in
london
new
york
and
hong
kong
it
would
be
hard
for
the
firm
to
justify
to
client
or
prospect
have
another
international
investment
product
headquarter
in
san
francisco
a
great
city
for
living
it
may
well
be
say
ford
but
it
s
not
consider
a
center
of
international
invest
compare
to
london
or
hong
kong
or
new
york
so
keep
rcm
s
product
separate
would
be
a
problem
we
d
be
buying
business
we
knew
we
be
go
to
lose
and
should
lose
not
a
smart
move
a
large
problem
be
in
bond
management
gsam
have
bond
management
and
rcm
have
bond
management
and
the
two
bond
operation
be
similar
in
investment
style
the
obvious
answer
be
to
bring
rcm
s
bond
asset
and
some
of
its
key
people
to
new
york
and
combine
them
with
gsam
s
team
into
one
major
operation
but
the
rcm
people
as
settle
san
franciscan
be
not
about
to
agree
to
that
and
gsam
couldn
t
agree
to
pay
a
full
price
for
a
duplicate
bond
business
when
have
two
similar
unit
would
be
confuse
for
client
prospect
and
the
consultant
who
advise
institutional
investor
on
select
manager
we
d
have
have
channel
conflict
all
over
the
place
say
ford
and
there
be
other
problem
san
francisco
be
too
far
from
new
york
where
gsam
have
its
headquarters
claude
rosenberg
have
great
stature
in
the
pension
market
but
he
have
retire
and
nobody
have
fill
his
shoe
in
addition
they
have
some
interest
internal
politics
and
they
have
no
new
business
pipeline
so
after
give
serious
consideration
to
acquire
rcm
ford
and
mcnulty
decide
to
take
a
pas
and
kept
look
for
other
firm
to
acquire
it
didn
t
take
long
do
you
guy
see
what
i
saw
in
today
s
ft
it
be
still
the
spring
of
and
george
walker
have
just
come
over
to
gsam
from
investment
banking
highly
regard
as
a
strategic
thinker
walker
would
effect
three
significant
acquisition
in
each
value
not
for
the
asset
that
be
currently
under
management
but
for
its
distinctive
investment
capability
that
could
with
goldman
sachs
s
prowess
in
sale
and
business
development
lead
to
major
increase
in
asset
under
management
in
five
or
ten
year
walker
be
wave
the
financial
time
over
his
head
and
smile
he
saw
an
opportunity
in
the
british
government
s
decision
to
privatize
the
management
of
the
british
coal
board
s
pension
fund
the
auction
for
the
right
to
manage
the
british
coal
pension
scheme
have
be
declare
a
fail
auction
so
there
be
no
sale
but
that
doesn
t
necessarily
mean
that
it
s
game
over
i
know
i
may
sound
crazy
but
i
ll
bet
we
could
negotiate
to
acquire
the
british
coal
mandate
if
we
act
very
quickly
and
make
a
decent
offer
would
be
manager
be
expect
to
pay
up
front
for
the
right
to
receive
management
fee
for
a
fix
number
of
year
guaranteed
by
the
british
government
but
george
what
in
the
world
would
we
be
buying
it
s
just
a
contract
to
manage
two
big
pension
fund
and
for
only
seven
or
eight
year
not
exactly
hard
asset
george
you
re
right
but
you
re
wrong
too
you
re
not
look
at
this
for
what
it
really
be
here
s
the
way
to
see
the
value
here
the
uk
pension
business
have
long
be
close
to
outsider
like
us
four
big
british
investment
firm
with
four
british
consult
actuary
guard
the
gate
on
new
manager
selection
control
almost
all
the
uk
pension
business
as
thing
stand
today
we
ll
never
get
in
but
if
we
can
win
the
coal
we
ll
suddenly
be
on
the
inside
we
ll
be
able
to
show
the
consult
firm
what
we
can
really
do
and
they
ll
have
to
pay
attention
because
we
ll
be
out
of
the
hold
pen
where
they
keep
all
the
non
uk
investment
manager
like
gsam
we
ll
have
at
least
a
toehold
that
we
can
then
build
on
if
we
produce
decent
investment
performance
and
show
we
know
how
to
build
and
manage
a
major
investment
organization
we
can
launch
a
total
immersion
sale
campaign
to
win
over
the
consult
actuary
so
they
ll
bring
us
more
and
more
business
at
the
very
least
they
ll
give
us
a
decent
chance
to
win
business
by
include
us
in
more
of
the
beauty
parade
they
now
arrange
when
their
client
be
pick
new
manager
the
coal
board
have
go
through
two
fail
auction
the
senior
investment
manager
be
dead
set
against
a
uk
acquirer
because
they
knew
they
would
all
get
make
redundant
and
terminate
because
the
acquire
manager
would
already
have
people
in
all
the
key
position
with
five
hundred
thousand
coal
worker
pension
depend
on
it
the
british
government
clearly
want
a
strong
buyer
because
the
government
have
a
contractual
obligation
to
cover
any
shortfall
due
to
poor
investment
performance
by
appropriate
new
money
this
meant
that
good
risk
control
a
major
strength
of
goldman
sachs
would
be
particularly
important
walker
argue
that
if
goldman
sachs
could
get
the
mandate
and
be
the
coal
board
s
manager
that
would
be
the
firm
s
ticket
of
admission
the
key
to
open
all
those
close
door
with
billion
in
asset
it
brings
us
up
to
scale
we
won
t
be
really
big
but
we
will
clearly
be
a
presence
with
all
the
stockbrokerage
commission
that
the
coal
generates
we
can
buy
all
the
best
investment
research
in
the
city
of
london
and
we
know
from
our
brokerage
work
with
them
that
the
guy
at
the
coal
pension
fund
have
a
pretty
good
portfolio
team
and
pretty
good
research
but
they
don
t
do
any
marketing
so
we
ll
do
all
the
marketing
and
business
development
and
we
can
base
our
pitch
on
the
truth
we
bought
this
team
because
we
believe
in
them
and
that
s
why
prospect
should
buy
in
too
gsam
have
only
twenty
five
people
in
europe
but
decide
it
would
bid
for
the
multiyear
contract
know
that
the
coal
board
have
problem
with
staff
problem
with
information
technology
problem
with
operating
procedure
and
surely
problem
gsam
didn
t
yet
know
about
gsam
figure
it
have
three
two
year
block
of
time
to
work
within
two
year
to
fix
the
problem
two
more
year
to
run
the
coal
board
fund
and
establish
a
good
performance
record
and
two
year
after
that
to
build
asset
through
sell
service
to
others
the
coal
board
s
senior
people
assure
me
in
our
first
meeting
that
we
would
be
get
a
great
team
recall
ford
so
i
say
to
them
great
if
they
re
as
good
as
you
say
they
be
this
be
the
best
deal
in
the
world
for
them
because
with
our
marketing
organization
we
re
really
go
to
grow
this
business
gsam
have
an
interest
proposition
to
sell
to
the
investment
consultant
they
knew
goldman
sachs
have
stay
power
and
would
see
this
acquisition
as
a
solid
commitment
to
the
uk
market
the
consultant
be
worried
that
the
investment
business
be
consolidate
so
much
that
it
be
virtually
implode
only
four
important
uk
investment
manager
be
still
stand
down
from
six
two
year
before
and
way
down
from
twenty
important
manager
fifteen
year
earlier
with
only
four
investment
firm
left
the
consultant
be
afraid
of
lose
any
more
as
blood
say
the
whole
market
be
really
ready
for
strong
new
manager
like
us
ford
quickly
saw
the
opportunity
and
give
his
strong
support
it
be
like
a
free
option
if
we
have
an
up
stock
market
and
we
perform
at
least
decently
we
ll
have
have
a
big
win
if
there
s
a
down
market
we
ll
get
our
purchase
price
back
through
management
fee
and
we
ve
lose
nothing
gsam
paid
million
for
the
contract
and
over
the
next
six
year
receive
million
in
fee
we
make
lot
of
mistake
with
that
acquisition
remembers
blood
but
one
after
another
they
be
correct
during
the
integration
process
we
make
major
investment
in
it
and
in
people
and
it
take
us
five
year
to
reach
breakeven
but
when
we
do
we
have
a
big
strong
business
base
in
the
uk
and
a
platform
for
all
of
europe
some
in
the

judged
that
while

the

all
the

be
built
by
david
blood
british

be
an
acquisition
that
become
a
real
marriage
because
it
give
gsam
market
visibility
and
show
gsam
the
best
practice
in

the

oblige
gsam
to
produce

definition
of
several
different

management
capability
over
the
next
several
year
this
formalization
developed
into
a
major
competitive
advantage
because
large
account
increasingly
want
one

two

with
broad
investment
capability
who
could
take
responsibility
for
as
much
as
half
of
their
total

and
then
have
a

the

on

the

would
set
up
asset
management
business
unit
in
any
decent
market
we
left
uncovered
so
we
have
to
move
quickly
and
preempt
internal
competition
from
our
own
colleague
every
business
should
stick
to
its
real
strength
goldman
sachs
s
strength
be

we
want
to
sell
captive
gsam
investment
capability
because
raise
capital
for
other
investment
management
organization
be
a
lose
lose
proposition
for
gsam
if
the
manager
do
well
they
ll
drop
gsam
and
use
their
performance
record
to
raise
future
fund
on
their
own
so
gsam
loses
if
their
performance
be
poor
gsam
loses
period
the
much
well
business
model
be
to
organize
a
fund
of
fund
business
with
gsam
in
control
of
the
client
relationship
mcnulty
become
convince
that
alternative
include
private
equity
and
hedge
fund
of
all
sort
would
be
important
but
he
say
you
can
t
mix
long
only
invest
and
hedge
fund
in
the
same
organization
because
the
fee
structure
and
profitability
be
so
different
they
be
almost
contradictory
and
the
requisite
people
skill
and
discipline
all
differ
the
economics
and
profitability
be
too
different
the
management
style
be
too
different
and
the
internal
glory
be
too
different
how
can
you
help
but
know
that
the
hedge
fund
business
be
so
lucrative
that
it
have
to
be
your
first
priority
besides
with
hedge
fund
in
a
large
organization
the
incentive
for
hot
manager
to
go
out
on
their
own
be
way
too
big
the
answer
be
to
acquire
an
alternative
manager
ideally
in
a
different
city
and
run
that
business
separately
in
production
but
as
part
of
a
coordinate
combination
in
marketing
goldman
sachs
do
that
in
by
acquire

or
to
use
the
current
term
a

of
fund
during
the
s
commodity
corporation
s
return
have
be
superb
but
the
company
knew
that
performance
be
everything
didn
t
believe
in
marketing
and
culturally
couldn
t
accept
salesperson
as
a
result
it
couldn
t
raise
the
money
it
could
have
manage
so
revenue
from

cost
only
if

when

be
over
percent
per
annum
and

fee
be
earn
in

performance
be
dreadful
and
the
company
have
to
find
a
white
knight
quickly
to
take
it
over
the
fit
with

now
you

have
your

operationally
commodity

broke
up
its
total

into
many
different
subportfolios
and
each

ran
his

the

but

to
the

diversification
the
risk
be
not

they
offset
each

at
the

paulson
be
classically
alone
at
the
top
one
strategy
advanced
by
some
at
goldman
sachs
have
be
to
achieve
public
ownership
without
go
through
the
stress
uncertainty

distraction
of
an

combine
the

into
a
publicly
own

chase
manhattan
be
mention
most
frequently

after
some
initial
exploration
by
jon
corzine
that
idea
have
not
be
pursue
at
the
arrowwood
meeting
john
thornton
have
protest
that
do
an
ipo
without
a
clear
strategic
vision
of
the
organization
s
future
and
of
how
go
public
would
advance
that
vision
be
like
only
one
hand
clap
he
go
on
to
say
that
the
firm
s
go
public
would
almost
inevitably
lead
to
a
merger
with
a
big
bank
then
to
illustrate
his
point
and
give
it
specificity
he
have
say
with
j
p
morgan
later
after
goldman
sachs
go
public
in
the
firm
give
serious
consideration
to
combine
with
j
p
morgan
the
prevail
view
be
that
all
the
lead
investment
banking
firm
would
have
to
have
big
balance
sheet
to
succeed
or
even
to
survive
advocate
of
the
merger
point
to
how
commercial
bank
have
bought
control
of
security
firm
in
london
after
big
bang
and
how
citibank

recently
combine
with
traveler
have
acquire
smith
barney
and
salomon
brother
in
most
country
commercial
bank
own

be
buying
into

firm
and
use
their
big
balance
sheet
and
price
cut
to
force
their
way
into
the
business
the
trend
many
believe
be
irreversible
and
the
mistake
would
be
to
stay
romantically
attach
to
the
old
separation
of
investment
and
commercial
banking
and
try
to
compete
without
the
strategic
imperative
of
the

a
big
balance
sheet
corzine
and
j
p

s
chairman

douglas
sandy
warner
have
have
preliminary
conversation
and
one
meeting
to
explore
a
possible

and
have
developed
an
easy
rapport
after
the
ipo
paulson
follow
up
on
corzine
s
conversation
by
accept
an
invitation
to
a
private
luncheon
host
by
warner
at
j

where
they
talk
about
revive
those

the
two
men
be
cordial
to
each

but
the
luncheon
lead
nowhere
after
several
month
pass
paulson

warner
to
breakfast
at

after

they

the
point
we
ve
do
a
lot
of
think
about
the
future
of

and
would
like
to
talk
very
seriously
about
the
merit
of
a
combination
if
after
serious
consideration
it
look
desirable
we
would
make
a
very
specific

at
warner

insistence
it

that

each

strictly
forbidden
he
worried
that
goldman

might
pick
off
some
of

be
particularly
anxious

protect
the

specialist
both
group
have
learn
a
lot
about
each

their

as
warner
recall
the

for

an
even

while
warner

be
hearing
clearly
the

they
should
have
be
well
tune
in
to
their
reservation
look
back
the
consensus
at
goldman
sachs
be
that
warner
be
wrong
to
be
his

expert

and
to
put
all
his
card
on
the
table
at
the
start
of
the
negotiation
more
specifically
paulson

surprised

learn
that

in
bond
and
in
equity
but
could
not
generate
half
as
much
in
revenue
they
be
also
concerned
to
learn
how
much
of
j
p
morgan
s
business
depend
on
derivative
and
proprietary
trading
and
they
be
particularly
concerned
about
have
to
go
through
large
layoff
after
a
combination
both
organization
have
regular
board
of
director
meeting
schedule
for
the
same
week
and
that
week
be
fast
approach
so
if
a
deal
be
to
be
do
the
time
for
decision
be
come
up
soon
it
s
time
now
to
be
specific
say
warner
give
what
he
felt
be
the
strong
business
case
for
goldman
sachs
s
acquire
j
p
morgan
it
be
time
to
set
a
price
to
represent
full
fair
value
for
j
p
morgan
s
shareholder
that
price
would
have
to
be
a
premium
over
the
current
market
price
for
morgan
share
while
the
two
organization
be
explore
each
other
as
business
paulson
and
warner
and
the
others
be
learn
more
about
each
other
as
people
and
as
business
leader
warner
be
particularly
anxious
to
settle
on
the
management
role
he
call
paulson
and
ask
if
he
could
come
over
to
goldman
sachs
s
office
there
he
propose
that
he
and
paulson
become
co
chairman
of
the
new
company
paulson
wasn
t
ready
to
get
specific
about
title
until
a
decision
have
be
make
on
a
combination
but
he
want
to
avoid
any
misunderstand
about
the
senior
management
structure
acknowledge
the
possibility
of
become
co
chairman
with
thain
and
thornton
as
co
president
he
be
clear
on
one
specific
i
ll
be
ceo
warner
reply
i
do
know
the
difference
between
a
merger
and
an
acquisition
paulson
recall
sandy
understood
that
as
ceo
i
would
select
the
leadership
team
and
say
hopefully
you
will
pick
some
of
our
guy
for
your
top
team
then
warner
ask
why
not
be
co
nonexecutive
chairman
we
do
the
deal
and
then
appoint
thain
and
thornton
co
ceo
to
address
all
the
tough
implementation
issue
and
do
all
the
reorganization
work
work
that
will
involve
large
redundancy
in
both
organization
over
three
or
four
year
of
difficult
integration
to
make
the
acquisition
work
there
be
sure
to
be
lot
of
redundancy
and
many
layoff
for
example
goldman
sachs
have
people
in
tokyo
and
j
p
morgan
have
people
in
tokyo
paulson
brush
the
proposal
aside
i
m
not
ready
for
that
and
our
firm
be
not
ready
for
that
on
monday
of
the
week
when
both
organization
have
board
meeting
where
presumably
the
combination
would
be
ratify
paulson
told
warner
i
m
go
to
my
apartment
now
by
myself
to
give
this
whole
proposition
a
deep
think
let
me
sleep
on
it
and
i
ll
call
you
in
the
morning
look
back
year
later
paulson
recall
i
kept
ask
myself
in
what
business
be
they
well
than
we
be
in
five
year
where
will
they
be
strong
than
we
will
be
at
the
very
end
with
board
meeting
come
up
for
both
of
us
i
met
early
in
the
morning
with
thain
and
thornton
and
told
them
i
have
decide
we
be
not
go
to
do
this
deal
and
hop
i
wasn
t
disappoint
them
too
much
legally
we
would
be
acquire
morgan
but
j
p
morgan
be
so
much
big
than
goldman
sachs
that
in
reality
they
would
be
take
us
over
and
they
would
bury
us
i
also
knew
that
somehow
we
d
figure
out
how
to
do
everything
they
could
do
early
that
morning
paulson
call
the
member
of
goldman
sachs
s
management
committee
and
then
all
his
director
there
be
no
great
push
from
our
board
i
have
kept
them
close
enough
to
my
think
all
along
so
they
would
stick
with
me
if
i
go
either
way
on
the
decision
at
nine
o
clock
paulson
call
warner
they
have
be
planning
to
meet
and
discus
specific
number
so
warner
be
startle
to
hear
sandy
i
ve
decide
not
to
proceed
all
i
can
tell
you
be
that
i
go
home
to
consider
all
our
option
and
ask
myself
be
this
best
for
goldman
sachs
and
what
i
really
want
to
do
and
the
answer
to
that
core
question
be
no
and
that
s
final
paulson
never
call
again
warner
in
paulson
s
view
could
not
have
be
more
gracious
as
he
thanked
paulson
for
call
but
after
hang
up
warner
who
have
be
under
increase
pressure
from
his
board
to
do
a
deal
be
understandably
upset
he
felt
paulson
have
never
be
serious
and
have
just
be
ask
all
sort
of
question
get
into
bed
for
some
sex
with
no
intention
of
ever
get
married
in
frustration
warner
protest
at
each
stage
along
the
way
their
guy
say
the
combination
look
well
and
well
and
use
term
like
home
run
what
have
change
for
christ
s
sake
the
frustration
warner
felt
be
still
evident
in
his
summation
it
s
really
something
when
one
man
take
something
that
important
that
far
with
over
a
hundred
people
involve
on
each
side
and
then
overnight
decides
no
the
gulf
between
the
two
men
spill
over
into
the
press
a
story
appear
in
the
wall
street
journal
that
goldman
sachs
have
agree
to
a
merger
and
then
renege
warner
explains
how
that
story
originate
paulson
have
really
spun
it
when
he
told
the
press
that
we
go
to
them
offering
ourselves
this
force
us
to
say
something
ourselves
to
set
the
record
straight
paulson
deny
this
account
any
leak
come
from
j
p
morgan
and
we
respond
paulson
be
virtually
alone
when
he
make
his
decision
and
he
be
profoundly
alone
when
he
told
thain
and
thornton
i
hope
i
haven
t
disappointed
you
guy
too
much
thain
and
thornton
who
have
both
favor
do
the
deal
each
call
their
opposite
number
at
j
p
morgan
to
say
they
be
surprised
and
that
they
would
try
to
turn
it
around
but
they
couldn
t
change
paulson
s
decision
look
back
paulson
say
only
a
few
people
on
the
management
committee
be
not
bull
on
j
p
morgan
but
as
the
year
pass
and
j
p
morgan
merge
into
chase
manhattan
bank
each
observer
include
warner
come
around
to
the
conclusion
that
paulson
s
decision
have
probably
be
right
for
goldman
sachs
balance
sheet
asset
which
would
have
be
huge
in
a
goldman
sachs
morgan
merger
be
a
powerful
store
of
value
they
show
the
strength
of
past
achievement
and
can
be
use
to
create
new
revenue
and
absorb
risk
and
loss
but
the
real
strength
of
a
modern
day
financial
intermediary
be
not
balance
sheet
capital
nearly
so
much
as
it
be
reliable
ready
large
volume
access
to
the
capital
market
and
that
depends
on
the
creativity
and
connectedness
of
people
with
superior
talent
drive
and
strategic
dynamism
these
asset
be
far
great
at
goldman
sachs
and
be
increase
with
the
discipline
and
focus
that
paulson
have
always
live
by
as
a
leader
and
talent
finder
goldman
sachs
be
almost
certain
to
continue
accumulate
and
compound
its
competitive
advantage
the
firm
s
access
to
the
open
capital
market
of
the
world
meant
that
it
could
obtain
asset
and
lay
off
risk
at
time
of
its
own
choose
it
do
not
need
to
own
huge
balance
sheet
asset
because
it
could
always
find
institution
that
would
rent
them
to
the
firm
meanwhile
the
firm
s
own
comparative
advantage
unusually
talented

individual
interconnect
through
share
value
teamwork
whitehead
s
principle
and
the
high
financial
reward
of
effectiveness
would
lift
goldman
sachs
to
high
and
high
level
of
power
and
profit
even
though
many
able
people
believe
that
merger
be
the
right
way
to
go
at
the
time
paulson
be
make
his
crucial
decision
these
competitive
strength
could
have
be
overwhelmed
and
dissipate
by
a
combination
with
a
bank
even
with
the
best

paulson
have
be

as
a
guard
at
dartmouth

he
be
ranked
as
one
of
the
college
s
twenty
four

their

call
on
corporate
treasurer

not

because
wall
street
s
principal
function
be
raise
capital
a
specialized

function
but
when
paulson
be
get
start
in
the
late
seventy
the
takeover
boom
be
change
all
that
investment
banker
be
no
longer
just
talk
about
money
they
be
now
take
about
a
company
s
very
survival
and
the
ceo
s
own
career
with
new
service
like
tender
defense
suddenly
the
establish
relationship
base
on
standard
financing
be
eclipse
by
new
more
strategic
relationship
with
ceo
as
a
new
man
with
no
prior
relationship
that
he
have
to
spend
most
of
his
time
maintain
paulson
could
focus
all
his
energy
on
develop
long
term
client
relationship
and
on
the
best
opportunity
for
significant
new
business
and
so
he
do
government
service
have
give
him
confidence
in
deal
with
very
senior
people
like
cabinet
officer
and
his
access
to
insider
story
about
the
top
people
in
government
give
him
a
special
advantage
in
his
drive
to
link
up
with
corporate
ceo
he
make
the
most
of
his
advantage
position
himself
as
a
confidant
not
just
another
young
investment
banker
to
ceo
at
company
like
caterpillar
kellogg
and
sears
hank
paulson
be
tenacity
observes
lee
cooperman
persistently
forceful
in
express
his
idea
paulson
be
competitively
aggressive
without
be
abrasive
he
regularly
call
client
executive
late
at
home
and
would
go
to
the
mat
if
he
thought
they
be
take
the
wrong
action
in
any
deal
similarly
say
partner
peter
fahey
he
would
not
hesitate
to
block
other
firm
if
he
thought
something
be
not
fair
or
not
right
for
me
and
goldman
sachs
he
s
intensely
competitive
hank
be
a
lot
more
than
a
bull
in
the
china
shop
he
be
a
force
of
nature
very
smart
and
a
huge
producer
paulson
s
self
discipline
serve
him
well
as
a
high
volume
high
value
relationship
banker
still
it
must
have
be
surprising
for
client
ceo
to
be
force
into
a
corner
by
paulson
s
sincere
unrelenting
logic
as
he
work
to
advocate
a
corporate
action
he
knew
be
for
the
client
company
s
own
good
over
time
paulson
s
persistence
in
do
what
be
right
won
him
the
respect
and
admiration
of
the
chicago
business
leadership
a
group
that
prize
trustworthy
directness
and
feel
uncomfortable
with
the
too
smooth
way
it
often
associate
with
people
from
the
coast
one
of
paulson
s
great
advantage
in
life
be
that
he
be
always
learn
partly
through
continuous
observation
of
others
partly
because
he
take
criticism
easily
with
no
defense
and
no
resistance
and
never
personally
a
weakness
be
that
he
be
almost
oblivious
to
office
politics
and
for
year
have
to
fight
the
urge
to
speak
his
mind
immediately
without
caution
or
consideration
in
develop
relationship
with
client
company
ceo
paulson
be
unconventional
he
work
on
nonbanking
matter
like
the
composition
of
board
of
director
or
investor
relation
always
look
for
way
to
demonstrate
goldman
sachs
s
value
and
win
more
business

later

paulson
found
an

mentor
in
jim

one
of
the

s
great
relationship
banker
and
talent
developer
when
assign
to
chicago
paulson
be
told
normally
we
don
t
assign
men
as
young
as
you
be
to
important
client
relationship
but
you
re
bald
enough
to
look
old
than
you
be
so
you
ll
be
okay
gorter
take
paulson
under
his
wing
and
counsel
it
s
not
how
quickly
you
start
complete
transaction
but
how
well
you
do
your
work
do
everything
the
right
way
always
don
t
chase
near
term
transaction
go
long
term
do
it
right
and
you
ll
get
the
really
big
business
relationship
banking
be
not
a
sprint
it
s
a
marathon
gorter
taught
paulson
a
great
lesson
secure
people
give
all
the
credit
they
can
to
the
other
people
on
the
team
the
strength
of
this
advice
be
amplify
for
paulson
by
comparison
to
partner
who
take
credit
sometimes
more
than
they
deserve
and
seriously
hurt
their
career
over
the
longer
term
gorter
would
continue
to
counsel
paulson
even
when
paulson
be
ceo
and
gorter
have
retire
gorter
would
modestly
say
of
course
i
m
no
longer
directly
involve
and
can
t
be
sure
but
my
instinct
would
be
and
then
go
on
to
give
his
wise
advice
he
give
paulson
the
benefit
of
the
best
detailed
think
of
a
shrewd
firm
patriot
who
spoke
in
private
and
with
candor
paulson
also
get
advice
from
steve
friedman
on
organizational
and
strategic
decision
particularly
the
buildup
of
principal
invest
eventually
despite
the
strong
feeling
weinberg
and
others
still
held
paulson
would
bring
friedman
onto
the
board

that
what

call
the

overblown
as
a

it

on

the

would
be
conduct
outside
the

would
not
involve

to
be
certain
the
payoff
would
be
worth
the

risk
the

the

must
be
really
big
as
always
the
quality
of
the
client
company
the
probability
of
success
and
the
competition
would
also
be
criterion
the
chosen
deal
be
krupp
s
hostile
acquisition
of
thyssen
a
multibillion
dollar
deal
in

of

that
would
produce
nearly

while
some
client
wonder
the
overall
reaction

neutral
in
the
european

there
be
little
or
no

because
everybody

that

s
prospect
be
decline
and
would
continue
to
decline
unless
a
major
change
be
make
and
that

for

do
not

if

they
be
not
about
to
concede
in

as
coo
paulson
want
to
examine
the
profitability
of
the

in

so
he
call

with

partner
wiet

who
have
a

have
signal
ahead

he
be
dissatisfied
with
london
s
profitability
pot
and
ward
have
zero
interest
in
be
rake
over
the
coal
so
they
agree
in
advance
to
seize
the
initiative
and
ask
paulson
all
the
question
partly
for
fun
and
partly
to
control
the
session
pot
a
tough
dutch
catholic
who
be
never
intimidate
begin
ask
question
right
away
to
put
paulson
on
the
defensive
why
do
you
call
this
meeting
i
want
to
know
how
you
be
manage
this
particular
business
i
see
you
have
some
sort
of
concern
perhaps
a
real
worry
okay
what
exactly
concern
you
paulson
who
have
expect
to
be
ask
the
question
be
caught
off
guard
his
first
response
be
a
bit
uncertain
pot
quickly
pour
it
on
which
business
be
large
in
london
hank

or
private

i
m
not
sure
you
re
not
sure
okay
how
big
be
we
take
together
as
a
business
i
don
t
have
an
exact
revenue
number
so
you
don
t
know
the
revenue
okay
how
many
analyst
trader
or
salesman
do
we
have
the
barrage
of
question
kept
come
and
come
at
paulson
until
pot
pause
to
say
so
let
me
summarize
as
the
firm
s
coo
you
ve
call
a
meeting
apparently
because
someone
whisper
to
you
that
we
may
have
a
problem
but
you
don
t
know
the
size
and
mix
of
our
business
our
revenue
versus
competitor
revenue
the
number
of
our
people
or
any
other
particular
about
our
competitive
situation
or
even
why
we
run
our
business
the
way
we
do
so
in
brief
you
ve
call
a
meeting
for
which
you
be
not
prepared
paulson

he

it

agree
to
set
aside
another

clearly
the
drive

the
decision

make
several
persuasive
call
to
key
people
in
support
of
the

division
s
strategy
that
division
have
be
struggle
with
weak
profit
and
fear
not
have
retail
business
would
put
it
at
a
serious
strategic
disadvantage
versus
competition
he
thought
spear
leeds
be
a
close
cultural
fit
with
goldman
sachs
others
worried
that
it
have
a
history
of

violation

a
nasd
fine
of
for
intentionally
delay
report
of
trade
to
get
a
profitable
competitive
advantage
spear
leeds
have
respond
that
it
be
not
surprising
that
we
have
fall
short
of
perfection
give
its
trading
volume
paulson
insist
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
we
feel
very
comfortable
with
their
people
and
their
standard
within
goldman
sachs
view
on
the
acquisition
differ
strongly
skeptic
argue
that
at
billion
it
be
far
too
expensive
that
the
specialist
business
be
yesterday
s
business
and
sure
to
be
head
for
disruptive
change
and
that
the
two
culture
be
not
complementary
advocate
saw
the
acquisition
as
a
way
to
get
closer
to
retail
order
flow
which
be
important
to
underwriting
in
the
new
dot
com
era
today
the
consensus
would
confirm
that
acquire
spear
leeds
be
strategically
wrong
and
not
a
good
deal
spear
leeds
kellogg
have
three
different
business
it
be
the
large
specialist
on
the
new
york
and
american
stock
exchange
it
do
a
major
clearing
business
processing
transaction
for
local
broker
around
the
country
and
it
make
market
in
over
stock
on
nasdaq
which
compare
to
just
stock
for
goldman
sachs
spear
leeds
serve
account
so
there
be
possibility
of
cross
sell
goldman
sachs
s
service
to
those
account
there
be
clear
plus
and
minus
to
the
transaction
as
paulson
say
we
be
concerned
that
we
didn
t
have
access
to
retail
business
and
retail
distribution
this
transaction
be
important
to
our
people
in
the
equity
business
in
a
time
of
fast
change
we
want
to
expand
our
strategic
option
the
problem
be
that
goldman
sachs
bought
spear
leeds
before
it
have
a
clear
understand
of
the
direction
the
market
be
move
in
the
structure
of
the
equity
market
be
in
a
state
of
flux
and
uncertainty
spread
be
under
pressure
look
back
paulson
take
a
rather
optimistic
view
even
while
recognize
that
the
acquisition
tarnished
the
firm
s
reputation
while
the
specialist
business
deteriorate
more
quickly
than
we
anticipate
and
the
nasdaq
or
over
the
counter
business
be
very
disappoint
we
get
a
great
technological
trading
platform
in
the
clearing
business
that
have
work
out
well
and
be
today
the
backbone
of
one
of
the
large
electronic
trading
network
in
the
world
so
while
that
acquisition
didn
t
enhance
our
reputation
net
net
it
be
probably
okay
others
would
be
less
sanguine
some
have
grouse
about
vaporize
several
billion
whatever
its
merit
in
the
clearing
business
spear
leeds
executive
be
surprised
to
learn
how
badly
inferior
their
technology
for
risk
control
be
to
what
goldman
sachs

have

call

that
private

could
have
major
attraction
for

determine
to
establish
a
major
business
for
goldman
sachs
in
private
equity
and
real

not
as
an

as
a

principal
business
geographically
as
its
way
of

paulson
reject
that
sort
of
action
you
could
locate
principal
invest
at
the
south
pole
but
if
you
do
something
wrong
or
if
an
action
be
perceive
as
a
conflict
that
will
hurt
you
with
the
same
client
just
as
much
during
an
era
in
which
other
banking
firm
be
drop
out
of
private
equity
invest
and
say
we
don
t
want
to
compete
with
our
client
paulson
go
the
other
way
typical
of
his
direct
style
and
thoroughness
he
visit
with
every
significant
private
equity
firm
and
make
his
case
we
ll
be
smarter
well
banker
and
more
effective
in
our
work
with
you
if
we
do
this
and
gain
the
experience
we
be
go
to
do
both
principal
invest
for
our
own
account
often
we
hope
co
invest
with
you
as
partner
and
as
adviser
help
you
accomplish
your
objective
we
believe
we
know
how
to
manage
the
difference
and
avoid
direct
conflict
of
interest
we
want
you
to
understand
and
certainly
hope
you
will
understand
that
from
time
to
time
we
be
go
to
be
invest
for
our
own
account
regularly
and
in
size
there
be
no
need
to
say
that
goldman
sachs
would
not
be
ask
for
permission
paulson
s
drive
met
resistance
within
goldman
sachs
as
well
as
outside
senior
goldman
sachs
people
particularly
partner
who
have
go
limited
would
go
to
paulson
and
say
hank
you
re
destroy
the
culture
of
goldman
sachs
and
follow
on
with
an
explanation
like
we
cannot
compete
with
our
client
paulson
wasn
t
buying
it
what
they
really
mean
be
that
they
don
t
know
how
or
be
unwilling
to
adapt
to
change
the
fact
be
that
our
client
expectation
for
capital
commitment
and
share
the
risk
be
force
us
to
be
principal
the
business
be
change
because
our
client
want
us
to
change
if
you
don
t
or
won
t
change
you
will
wind
up
with
less
than
the
best
strategy
practice
and
plan
the
market
the
world
do
change
and
as
intermediary
we
must
change
paulson
with
help
from
john
mcnulty
peter
sacerdote
and
other
partner
move
the
firm
to
a
new
strategic
proposition
it
be
commit
to
be
both
explicitly
principal
and
agent
no
longer
could
or
should
client
expect
the
firm
to
be
just
an
agent
or
expect
it
to
subordinate
its
interest
in
the
principal
investment
it
might
make
on
its
own
account
with
its
own
capital
expertise
and
access
to
information
if
the
firm
have
a
client
relationship
the
people
work
for
that
client
or
that
assignment
would
of
course
strive
mightily
to
do
all
they
could
properly
do
to
excel
in
complete
that
mission
include
commit
capital
as
a
principal
but
goldman
sachs
would
also
be
work
just
as
hard
and
just
as
cleverly
and
imaginatively
for
its
own
account
i
saw
that
if
we
as
always
manage
business
selection
and
conflict
effectively
and
avoid
direct
conflict
we
could
do
both
investment
banking
and
principal
invest
say
paulson
if
you
deal
openly
with
client
this
should
serve
all
interest
well
and
make
us
a
strong
more
experienced
firm
able
to
do
even
well
for
client
in
the
future
goldman
sachs
leadership
would
be
responsible
for
manage
the
difference
so
they
would
not
be
and
would
not
be
see
to
be
in
conflict
of
course
a
major
challenge
with
such
a
position
be
that
goldman
sachs
be
hold
itself
responsible
for
decide
what
be
right
and
how
others
should
perceive
the
firm
s
decision
policy
and
practice
the
change
in
strategic
position
would
involve
educate
client
about
the
meaning
of
be
a

paulson

paulson
pursue
the

general
goal
through
difficult
time
as
a
director
of

in
he
be
told
by
the
exchange
s
ceo
richard
grasso
my
compensation
package
be
not
on
the
agenda
so
paulson
felt
no
need
to
change
his
plan
to
go
birding
in
argentina
and
miss
the
crucial
meeting
on
grasso
s
outsize

package
he
lie
to
you
hank
advise
an
experienced
senior

so
you
can
and
should
resign
with
a
clear
conscience
but
others
insist
he
should
stay
it
be
his
public
responsibility
so
paulson
at
considerable
cost
to
himself
stayed
on
and
work
through
the
problem
it
be
good
for
the
exchange
that
he
do
stay
over
the
next
few
year
the
old
obsolete

model

which
transform
operation
and
produce
major
gain
in
valuation
for
both
side
paulson
s
decision
not
to
combine
with
a
major
bank
left
him
with
a
major
unanswered
question
how
would
goldman
sachs
compete
with
the
world
s
lead
universal
bank
all
the
universal
bank
be
push
their
way
into

banking
by
lending
capital
they
be
substantially
increase
their
lending
capacity
by
syndicate
term
loan
but
their
main
competitive
weapon
be
speed
to
commitment
flexibility
on
term
that
they
could
custom
tailor
to
the
specific
borrower
and
price
if
those
who
have
advocate
goldman
sachs
s
combine
with
a
big
bank
have
foreseen
these
development
they
would
have
insist
on
a
merger
in
paulson
found
an
opportunity
to
obtain
comparable
capacity
to
provide
capital
without
have
to
absorb
a
large
commercial
bank
the

paulson
work
out
an
agreement
in
which
goldman
sachs
make
a
substantial
investment
in
the
bank
and
sumitomo
mitsui
would
provide
a
backup
guarantee
behind
commercial
paper
issue
by
goldman
sachs
with
this
innovation
the

in

amount
up
to

through

an
enormous
balance

that
goldman

could
call
on
at
any
time
this
arrangement
also
offer
a

of

and

a
capability
that
be
certain
to

to
the
top
job
with
the
support
of
his
chosen
co
coo
thain
and
thornton
and
an
understand
among
them
that
he
would
serve
only
two
year
they
have
work
well
together
in
the
early
year
but
now
he
be
have
second
thought
on
how
long
he
should
stay
and
on
his
successor
which
add
to
the
question
of
his
own
appropriate
tenure
some
partner
do
not
react
well
to
thornton
and

john

capture
the
problem
that
thain
and
thornton
be
develop
for
themselves
they
act
like
the
owner
s
son
at
the
same
time
paulson
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
should
stay
i
be
na
ve
to
think
i
could
do
my
part
in
only
two
year
and
i
couldn
t
leave
once
we
decide
on
the
ipo
doubt
be
spread
about
thornton
s
become
ceo
he
be
recognize
as
one
of
the
most
creative
strategist
and
relationship
builder
the
firm
have
ever
have
as
one
partner
summarizes
however
great
charm
and
amaze
macro
vision
he
be
superb
on
the
big
picture
but
he
have
no
long
live
or
deep
friendship
with
other
partner
when
he
be
co
coo
he
didn
t
do
the
work
after
he
and
thain
carve
up
the
world
and
divide
up
the
business
unit
of
the
firm
thornton
seem
to
lose
interest
and
just
didn
t
go
to
some
of
the
area
he
be
responsible
for
just
didn
t
go
period
while
some
felt
he
might
have
be
a
great
nonexecutive
chairman
he
didn
t
show
the
necessary
interest
in
the
nut
and
bolt
of
implementation
control
of
cost
or
organizational
discipline
thornton
would
have
picked
up
signal
of
a
change
in
paulson
s
feeling
toward
him
as
a
co
successor
and
knew
he
have
generate
resentment
within
the
firm
his
ability
to
conceptualize
remarkable
strategy
for
the
firm
or
for
client
could
be
apply
of
course
to
his
own
career
recognize
that
paulson
be
increasingly
think
of
stay
on
he
ask
only
stay
if
that
s
what
you
d
like
to
do
hank
but
please
tell
us
so
we
can
make
our
own
plan
as
paulson
gradually
extend
his
estimate
term
and
then
stop
talk
about
leave
thornton
do
not
wait
he
have
conversation
with
a
few
major
u
s
company
about
become
ceo
and
continued
to
build
up
his
personal
franchise
in
china
where
he
have
be
rapidly
expand
the
firm
s
investment
banking
business
for
paulson
as
ceo
it
would
have
be
troublesome
to
have
chosen
a
successor
who
do
not
give
priority
attention
to
careful
implementation
he
may
also
have
be
concerned
that
thornton
s
brilliant
conceptualize
and
articulate
could
someday
surprise
him
with
the
sort
of
surprise
that
have
stun
corzine
in
the
management
committee
whatever
the
reason
paulson
told
thornton
he
would
be
stay
this
begin
the
conversation
that
lead
to
the
announcement
that
thornton
would
be
leave
paulson
call
director
one
at
a
time
to
inform
them
and
be
sure
they
be
comfortable
with
his
think
john
browne
of
bp
saw
right
away
that
thornton
be
go
down
and
couldn
t
be
save
so
he
stood
back
and
let
him
go
but
a
year
later
get
him
a
seat
on
the
board
of
director
at
intel
thornton
would
see
the
process
of
separation
quite
differently
academic
institution
be
consider
more
central
and
prestigious
in
china
than
in
america
so
close
observer
may
not
have
be
surprised
at
least
in
retrospect
to
learn
that
thornton
accepted
an
appointment
as
a
professor
at
tsinghua
university
s
business
school
where
he
would
teach
an
advanced
course
on
leadership
what
few
would
have
know
or
appreciate
be
the
importance
attach
to
such
an
appointment
by
the
chinese
government
full
professor
must
be
endorse
by
the
state
council
a
process
closer
to
the
way
federal
judge
be
confirm
in
america
it
take
time
at
least
six
month
and
thornton
would
be
the
first
non
chinese
elevate
to
such
stature
the
result
be
that
while
paulson
come
to
the
conclusion
that
he
would
stay
and
lose
thornton
in
january
announce
it
in
march
with
an
effective
date
in
july
that
separation
process
have
already
be
quietly
initiate
by
thornton
the
previous
october
after
leave
thornton
have
dinner
with
thain
and
advise
him
to
give
fresh
consideration
to
the
situation
particularly
if
lloyd
blankfein
be
advanced
to
equal
status
while
thain
have
be
work
almost
exclusively
on
internal
operation
and
organization
blankfein
have
be
accumulate
the
power
of
profit
start
with
j
aron
which
have
expand
boldly
in
oil
trading
and
foreign
exchange
he
have
then
take
over
and
integrate
fix
income
and
then
add
equity
his
unit
now
account
for
percent
of
the
profit
of
goldman
sachs
and
historically
he
who
control
the
profit
control
the
firm
blankfein
be
increasingly
popular
and
he
be
smart
he
and
thornton
be
not
close
paulson
have
a
plan
with
thornton
out
he
would
appoint
blankfein
already
a
member
of
the
board
of
director
to
be
co
coo
paulson
recall
that
when
they
work
together
in
on
the
operation
committee
i
saw
that
lloyd
have
great
ability
late
on
a
december
morning
of
paulson
complete
the
change
that
he
have
plan
so
carefully
and
as
always
on
organizational
matter
have
talk
over
with
his
board
of
director
paulson
have
discuss
the
co
presidency
with
thain
for
several
week
but
thain
have
be
vigorously
resist
that
approach
that
may
be
why
paulson
decide
to
ask
thain
to
co
sign
the
memo
to
the
firm
announce
that
blankfein
would
be
elevate
to
co
president
paulson
may
have
thought
he
have
evidence
that
thain
would
see
that
his
best
decision
would
be
to
stay
accept
reality
and
adapt
and
continue
earn
large
reward
in
his
already
remarkable
career
realistically
he
would
have
no
comparably
appeal
alternative
but
thain
do
have
an
alternative
he
knew
john
reed
from
their
service
together
on
the
mit
corporation
equivalent
to
its
board
of
trustee
thain
have
be
approach
by
reed
to
be
the
new
reform
head
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
major
change
at
the
nyse
be
certain
and
they
played
to
thain
s
strength
the
public
service
integrity
of
the
exchange
have
be
severely
question
when
richard
grasso
s
prodigious
compensation
package
become
public
and
the
nyse
be
fall
behind
in
two
major
area
automation
and
globalization
that
be
area
of
strength
for
thain
in
addition
thain
felt
more
than
ready
to
be
a
ceo
and
have
always
have
a
boy
scout
s
instinct
for
public
service
thain
and
reed
have
be
have
serious
and
advanced
discussion
and
reed
be
ready
to
make
a
formal
offer
so
shortly
after
his
head
up
thain
close
his
door
picked
up
his
phone
and
call
reed
to
say
the
mission
at
the
exchange
be
right
for
me
and
the
timing
be
good
if
you
can
make
a
definitive
offer
now
we
have
an
agreement
reed
could
and
within
hour
do
thain
go
to
tell
paulson
paulson
knew
thain
well
enough
to
know
he
have
no
chance
of
get
him
to
change
his
mind
so
he
didn
t
try
quickly
recover
from
the
surprise
he
take
the
line
he
would
continue
with
great
pride
that
another
leader
from
goldman
sachs
be
respond
to
a
major
public
need
with
all
the
change
a
casual
observer
could
have
see
the
reality
this
way
paulson
picked
thornton
and
he
s
go
he
picked
thain
and
he
s
go
paulson

consider
and
carefully
select
key
lieutenant
he
won
t
want
to
lose
blankfein
but
blankfein
understood
that
only
so
long
as
he
kept
paulson
s
confidence
do
he
have
leeway
to
continue
make
change
despite
some
initial
disagreement
senior
position
at
the
firm

soon
fill
by
people
both
men
want
operationally
goldman
sachs
be
become

but
blankfein
knew
he
would
have
to
measure
up
paulson
have
already
prove
he
be
ready
to
make
tough
decision
include
decision
on
management
succession
with
blankfein
on
the
board
and
instal
as
coo
paulson
have
his
succession
in
place
he
and
his
board
have
rigorously
review
each
of
the
firm

twenty
five
top
leader
and
agree
on
how
and
why
each
senior

confident
that
blankfein
would

of
a
very
complicate
but
now
publicly
own

and
as
the
environment

well
as
paulson

it
people
knock
lloyd
say
he
s
a
chameleon

unique
talent
for
a

have
equally
transform

the

with

i
believe
i
left

than
it
be
in
when
i
become

both
internally

even
well
his
colleague
at
goldman

and
his
customer
and
competitor
would
agree
while
it
would
not
have
change
his
decision
to
serve
his
nation
and
risk
his

by
join

the
irony
as
some
saw
it
be
that
the
financial
benefit
to
paulson
of
accept
the
call
of
duty
be
surely
great
than
that
enjoy
by
any
other
public
servant
in
u
s
history
goldman
sachs
have
long
have
a
policy
that
all
defer
compensation
becomes
payable
promptly
to
any
partner
who
accepts
a
senior
position
in
the
federal
government
congress
pass
a
law
a
quarter
century
ago
that
people
take
senior
appoint
federal
position
who
convert
their
investment
into
either
an
index
fund
or
a
blind
trust
can
do
so
upon
assume
office
with
zero
taxable
capital
gain
until
such
investment
be
later
sell
if
paulson
take
advantage
of
these
provision
they
enable
him
to
sell
his
share
in
goldman
sachs
without
raise
any
public
question
and
without
tax
and
to
diversify
his
large
personal
investment
in
a
single
stroke
for
just
over
two
year
service
the
saving
in
paulson
s
personal
income
tax
could
have
be
as
large
as
million
paulson
have
no
interest
in
diversify
his
investment
and
have
never
sell
a
share
of
goldman
sachs
stock
so
these
benefit
be
purely
hypothetical
there
s
another
large
irony
paulson
who
have
encourage
others
to
diversify
and
stay
at
the
firm
have
never
previously
sell
a
share
of
goldman
sachs
stock
he
sell
his
share
at
a
price
he
believe
deeply
and
accurately
be
low
because
be
a
very
strong
year
and
he
estimate
that
the
timing
of
the
sale
cost
him
million
he
also
have
to
liquidate
his
large
private
equity
holding
include
a
substantial
position
in
the
industrial
and
commercial
bank
of
china
which
have
since
multiply
fourfold
the
tax
break
be
no
great
boon
to
paulson
he
plan
to
give
most
of
his
wealth
to
his
charitable
foundation
philanthropy
and
public
service
be
more
important
to
goldman
sachs
people
particularly
its
alumnus
than
to
any
comparable
group
this
make
sense
because
they
earn
substantial
wealth
and
have
be
beneficiary
of

still
it

lloyd

that

the
coexistence

not

as

and
for

as
blankfein
assert
that

in

goldman
sachs
have
come

the

have
developed
for
itself
a
unique
strategic
position
each
of
those
strength
be
unequaled
and
in
aggregate
they
be
unbeatable
and
unmatchable
goldman
sachs
be
now
free
to
capitalize
on
all
the
year
of
hard
work
and
steady
business
development
do
by
predecessor
but
it
could
all
be
lose
of
course
it
would
be
lose
if
the

squander
its

fail
to
anticipate

manage
the
many
potential

fail
to
excel
in

important
agency
business
it
could
be
lose
if
the

make
the
easy
obvious
familiar
strategic
blunder
of
design
its
future
strategy
to
replay
old
movie
of
its
past
success

stay
too
commit
to
the
old
agency
business
like

brokerege
even
goldman

could
stabilize
stiffen
and
lose
bit
by

its

and
its
most
valuable
asset
the
freedom
to
choose
its

shrink
profit

would
translate
into

over

that
would

everyone
knew
that
goldman
sachs
do
great
recruiting
and
excellent
training
so
it
be
every
recruiter
s
favorite
fishing
ground
and
not
every
great
employee
would
love
forever
the
long
hour
and
the
intensity
of
work
at
goldman
sachs
take
away
the
remarkable
reward
and
then
have
two
or
three
so
so
year
or
bad
and
the
war
for
talent
would
be
in
full
force
against
goldman

but
that
bleak
future
needn
t
come
to
pas
blankfein
told
his
colleague
there
be
an
alternative
a
well
more
profitable
alternative
we
have
the
capital
and
investment
prowess
we
have
one
of
the
fast
grow
asset
management
operation
in
the
world
we
have
the
risk
management
skill
we
have
the
proprietary
research
we
have
the
originate

through
our
thousand
of
corporate
relationship
and
our
dozen
of
major
relationship
with

firm
we
have
the
knowledge
of
all
the
major
financial
market
around
the
world
we
have
the
creative
driven
people
and
so
we
have
every
opportunity
to
reorient
our
business
around
both
the
need
of
our
client
and
the
traditional
strength
of
our
firm
the
proposition
have
one
if
and
really
only
one
if
the
firm
have
the
wit
to
recognize
that
the
strategic
choice
be
not
agency
or
principal
the
best
choice
be
and
would
be
agency
and
principal
combine
together
in
an
unbeatable
whole
as
blankfein
explain
we
definitely
need
to
continue
nurture
major
relationship
with
corporation
central
bank
fund
and
investor
because
they
provide
us
with
more
and
well
deal
flow
than
anyone
else
and
we
always
need
to
preserve
and
build
that
great
strength
as
much
as
possible
it
be
vital
to
our
ability
to
be
profitable
and
attract
outstanding
people
to
goldman
sachs
agency
relationship
be
crucial
to
the
firm
but
never
forget
when
combine
with
be
a
principal
this
strategy
of
be
an
adviser
financier
and
co
investor
allows
us
to
recruit
and
keep
the
best
people
and
keep
building
our
reputation
as
the
preeminent
investment
bank
in
the
world
but
if
we
insist
on
anchor
our
firm
only
to
the
pure
agency
service
strategy
of
the
past
we
will
surely
gradually
at
first
but
inevitably
with
acceleration
cease
to
be
leader
and
even
lose
our
relevance
the
crucial
differentiate
advantage
of
goldman
sachs
would
be
one
that
