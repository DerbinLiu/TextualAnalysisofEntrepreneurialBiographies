perhaps
he
be
not
brash

cocky
anymore
maybe
four

the
complete
failure
of
one

perhaps
even
more
certain
of
his
own
decision

as
woz
watch
his
former

gently
even
humbly
accept
the
applause
and
the
praise
be
shower
on
him
tear
ran
down
woz
cheek
walk
out
of
the
hall
he
told
a
reporter
that
it
felt
just
like
the
old
day
with
steve
make
announcement
that
shook
my
world
if
woz
could
forgive
steve
so
could
anyone
it
have
be
a
long
time
since
steve
have
first
make
him
cry
but
lot
have
change
since
that
time
as
steve

bask
in
the
moment
the
giant
loudspeaker
come
to
life
he
slip
off

i

it
be
clear
that
steve

have
a
kind
of
chip
on
his
shoulder
at
some
deep
level
there
be
an
insecurity
that
steve

to
go
out

prove
himself
i

unhealthful

sign
that
he

one
of
these
neighbor

around
with
a
simple
carbon

that
he
would
brought
home
from
the
lab
steve
be
fascinate
with
the
device
and
ask
many
perceptive
question
soon
he
have
spent
so
much
time
at
the
engineer
home
and
have
so
impressed
the
man
with
his
precocity
that
he
be
give
the
microphone
for
his
own
from
his
peer
though
steve
reaped
nothing
but
trouble
he
be
already
a
renegade
much
later
a
schoolmate
would
describe
him
as
a
loner
pretty
much
of
a
crybaby
the
two
be
on
a
swim
team
together
one
of
steve
only
venture
into
team
sport
he
would
lose
a
race
and
go
off
by
himself
and
cry
he
do
not
quite
fit
in
with
everyone
else
he
be
not
one
of
the
guy
steve
youthful
penchant
for
mischief
and
willfulness
rapidly
developed
into
something
else
he
be
suspend
from
school
several
time
for
misbehavior
and
defy
his
teacher
refuse
to
do
any
schoolwork
or
assignment
that
he
felt
be
a
waste
of
time
accord
to
steve
himself
i
be
pretty
bore
in
school
and
i
turn
into
a
little
terror
he
be
the
ringleader
in
a
group
that
explode
bomb
and
let
snake
loose
in
the
classroom
you
should
have
see
us
in
third
grade
he
say
we
basically
destroyed
the
teacher
that
those
word
convey
a
sense
of
pride
and
satisfaction
in
give
pain
offer
another
clue
to
what
steve
would
become
it
be
no
surprise
that
he
be
eventually
expel
steve
soon
come
under
the
influence
of
a
fourth
grade
teacher
who
change
his
life
imogene
teddy
hill
she
be
one
of
the
saint
of
my
life
he
say
she
taught
an
advanced
fourth
grade
class
and
it
take
her
about
a
month
to

finish
this
workbook
i
will
pay

passion
in
me
for

steve
learn
more
that
year
than
in
any
other
year
in
school
his
teacher
want
him
to
skip
fifth
grade
and
go

eventually
his
parent
reluctantly
agree
he
enter
crittenden
middle

a
year
early
but
the
school
district
make
no

them
down
with

well
for
paul

he
have
quit
the
repo
business
and
become
a
real
estate
salesman
in
the
boom
world
of
the
peninsula
his
brusque
personality
be
not
suit
to
the
mix
of
obsequiousness
and
aggression
require
to
be
a
successful
realtor
one
day
during
steve
fourth
grade
year
teddy
hill
ask
her
class
what
be
it
in
the
world
that
you
do
not
understand
she
recall
that
steve
hand
shot
up
and
he
reply
i
do
not
understand
why
all
of
a
sudden
we
be
so
broke
in
time
paul
job
after
fifteen
year
away
from
the
trade
return
to
work
as
a
machinist
though
he
have
to
reenter
at
the
bottom
and
work
his
way
up
he
quickly
climbed
the
ladder
and
the
family
breathe
a
little
easy
financially
paul
go
to
work
for
spectraphysics
where
he
eventually
work
on
develop
the
system
of
mirror
that
read
bar
code
on
product
in
just
about
every
supermarket
in
the
world
steve
however
be
absolutely
miserable
at
his
new
school
mountain
view
crittenden
junior
high
be
much
tougher
than
the
grade
school
and
it
be
on
the
wrong
side
of
the
track
to
boot
the
local
police
be
often
call
to
break
up
fight
and
the
troublemaking
of
mountain
view
hooligan
make
steve
prank
seem
tame
by
comparison
his
free
spirit
and
immense
intelligence
go
unnoticed
against
the
backdrop
of
all
the
commotion
and
he
grow
increasingly
unhappy
and
frustrate
the
situation
become
so
dire
to
steve
mind
that
he
simply
decide
not
to
return
to
crittenden
the
follow
year
he
inform
his
father
of
the
decision
that
summer
after
much
discussion
paul
and
clara
accepted
the
reality
that
their
son
already
a
discipline
problem
be
on
the
verge
of
become
a
full
blown
juvenile
delinquent
they
understood
that
they
have
to
make
a
choice
he
say
he
just
would
not
go
back
to
that
school
recall
paul
job
so
we
move
at
eleven
year
old
steve
be
already
able
to
demonstrate
enough
strength
of
will
to
convince
his
parent
to
resettle
his
trademark
intensity
the
single
mindedness
that
he
could
apply
to
remove
any
obstacle
to
his
progress
be
already
evident
in
the
job
family
move
to
the
flatlands
of
los
alto
and
found
themselves
smack
in
the
middle
of
what
may
have
be
the
large
assemblage
of
science
wonk
ever
gather
in
one
place
since
the
manhattan
project
los
alto
and
the
surround
town
of
cupertino
and
sunnyvale
be
sown
through
with
electrical

and
their

as
the
prime
contractor
for
nasa
in
the

all
through
the
area
a
profusion
of
electronics
company
be
spring
up
to
service
the
moon
shot
it
be
also
ground
zero
for
a
wave
of
innovation
and
entrepreneurial
activity
that
exploit
the
world
of
electronic
miniaturization
ushered
in
by
the
invention
first
of
the
transistor
and
then
of
the
integrate
circuit
or
ic
which
crammed
hundred
of
those
transistor
onto
a
single
chip
in
every
garage
there
be
a
welcome
brain
for
steve
to
pick
and
a
box
or
two
fill
with
spare
part
or
obsolete
equipment
that
could
be
take
apart
after
school
in
contrast
to
rough
and
tumble
mountain
view
this
be
heaven
at
cupertino
junior
high
school
steve
met
bill
fernandez
the
slight
intense
son
of
a
local
attorney
who
be
as
much
of
a
misfit
as
the
young
job
neither
one
be
even
vaguely
athletic
they
be
both
skinny
scrawny
and
relatively
uncoordinated
but
they
each
have
a
discernible
intensity
view
as
oddness
by
their
classmate
electronics
be
the
perfect
outlet
for
these
outsider
they
could
pursue
their
interest
in
the
calm
solitude
of
the
neighborhood
garage
and
workshop
while
relegate
the
usual
adolescent
dilemma
of
peer
acceptance
sport
prowess
and
boy
girl
turmoil
to
another
world
for
hour
on
end
they
may
have
be
oddball
to
their
fellow
student
but
fernandez
and
job
have
tapped
into
the
sensibility
of
the
surround
community
of
engineer
and
scientist
i
have
this
vivid
memory
of
steve
job
recall
bruce
courture
who
attend
both
cupertino
junior
high
and
homestead
high
six
year
of
school
with
him
courture
be
vote
most
likely
to
succeed
in
the
senior
class
and
be
now
living
up
to
this
expectation
as
a
partner
at
one
of
the
most
successful
high
tech
law
firm
in
silicon
valley
it
be
one
moment
that
have
always
stuck
in
my
mind
it
be
a
very
foggy
day
all
us
boy
in
our
freshman
class
be
run
a
couple
of
lap
around
the
track
and
all
of
a
sudden
steve
who
be
ahead
of
me
glance
back
across
the
field
at
the
pe
coach
who
be
hidden
by
the
fog
and
saw
that
he
could
not
possibly
see
the
far
side
of
the
field
so
steve
sat
down
well
i
thought
that
be
a
pretty
good
idea
i
join
him
the
two
of
us
just
sat
and
watch
everyone
else
run
by
us
when
they
come
back
around
for
the
second
lap
we
stood
up
and
join
them
we
have
to
take
some
rib
but
he
have
figure
out
how
he
could
get
away
with
half
the
work
and
still
get
credit
for
the
whole
thing
i
be
really
impressed
especially
that
he
have
the
gut
to
try
it
even
though
he
be
just
a
freshman
i
would
never
have
thought
to
do
that
on
my
own
living
directly
across
the
street
from
the
fernandez
family
be
the
wozniaks
the
father
jerry
wozniak
be
an
engineer
with
lockheed
and
since
fernandez
parent
have
nothing
to
do
with
electronics
jerry
have
be
bill
mentor
and
tutor
in
the
subject
jerry
son
stephen
also
share
in
the
passion
for
electronics
and
on
occasion
pitch
in
with
fernandez
on
science
fair
project
despite
be
five
year
old
steve

enter
homestead

in
an
important

a
square
he
do
not
seem
to
notice

and
be
athletically
challenged
woz
as
he
would
be
call
since
grade
school
be
a
generally
obedient
youngster
despite
his
tendency
to
be
willful
in
certain
circumstance
he
also
have
the
ability
to
focus
completely
and
utterly
on
whatever
interested
him
and
often
become
so
absorbed
that
his
mother
only
recourse
be
to
rap
his
head
with
a
pencil
if
she
want
his
attention
few
thing
held
woz

constitute
its
basic
element
he
could
spend
endless
day
design

for
various
gadget
but
when
it
come
to
more
mundane
subject
like
literature

study
his
lack
of

back
from

woz

in
his
knowledge
of
electronics
and
cocky
enough
to
let
everyone
know

in
class
he
talk
back
to
his
electronics
teacher
catch
him
in

skill
while
develop
his

despite
his
academic
shortcoming
and

in
the
cupertino
neighborhood
and
be
a
figure
of
worship
to
kid
like
bill
fernandez
in
the
summer
of
woz
and
alan
baum
spent
a
few
month
fill
a
folder
with
schematic
and
specification
sheet
for
a
computer
then
when
baum
left
to
attend
mit
woz
decide
to
build
the
device
himself
scavenge
part
from
surplus
store
or
directly
from
sympathetic
company
he
convince
bill
fernandez
to
help
an
attractive
idea
since
the
methodical
fernandez
have
a
neat
carefully
design
and
eminently
accessible
workbench
in
his
garage
across
the
street
i
want
to
design
a
machine
that
do
something
wozniak
say
year
later
on
a
tv
you
turn
a
knob
and
it
do
something
on
my
computer
you
push
a
few
button
and
switch
and
light
would
come
on
that
be
his
goal
and
he
succeed
thing
could
happen
at
least
until
the
power
supply
explode
as
the
two
boy
be
demonstrate
their
machine
to
a
reporter
from
the
san
jose
mercury
news
it
may
not
have
be
a
sophisticated
device
but
wozniak
have
built
it
five
year
before
the
first
hobbyist
computer
kit
appear
on
the
market
they
call
it
the
flair
pen
or
cream
soda
computer
say
fernandez
woz
be
always
draw
schematic
design
with
them
he
say
you
could
tell
a
real
engineer
by
the
flair
pen
in
his
shirt
pocket
purple
be
the
color
of
choice
that
year
and
all
we
drank
be
cream
soda
in
bottle
we
be
so
broke
that
we
would
save
up
the
bottle
and
walk
over
to
safeway
to
get
the
deposit
back
so
we
could
buy
another
one
day
fernandez
invite
steve
job
to
see
the
computer
that
he
and
woz
have
built
it
be
the
first
meeting
between
woz
and
job
and
it
be
by
no
mean
auspicious
at
eighteen
wozniak
be
a
bona
fide
electronics
whiz
while
job
and
fernandez
five
year
young
be
just
a
couple
of
kid
who
do
not
know
much
of
anything
practical
about
the
subject
sure
they
like
to
play
with
gadget
but
they
be
much
more
interested
in
do
trick
with
laser
and
mirror
than
they
be
in
do
something
worthwhile
wozniak
on
the
other
hand
have
already
design
circuit
board
on
paper
for
more
elaborate
computer
and
regularly
visit
the
stanford
linear
accelerator
library
to
pore
over
the
most
advanced
material
he
could
find
job
be
awestruck
by
the
ability
represent
by
the
project
though
he
have
long
felt
unrivaled
in
his
knowledge
of
electronics
he
be
sober
by
his
realization
that
woz
be
the
first
person
i
met
who
knew
more
electronics
than
i
do
steve
job
have
already
heard
about
wozniak
from
fernandez
and
knew
his
reputation
as
a
highly
accomplish
prankster
his
most
famous
high
school
stunt
have
result
in
homestead

out
on
the
athletic
field

at

a
heavy
and
ominously

that
have
be

from
a
student
locker
the
bag
contain
brick
and
an
alarm
clock
this
little
episode
earn
woz
a
night
in
juvenile
hall
and
a
stand
ovation
from
the
student
body
upon
his
return
the
follow
day
steve
job
and
steve
wozniak
seem
to
be
cut
from
the
same
cloth
they
both
be
solitary
self
absorbed
and
isolated
neither
joiner
nor
jock
their
five
year
age
difference
be
trumped
by
the
passion
they
share
wozniak
have
an
ardor
for
electronics
that
make
his
sentence
run
together
like
a
speed
train
when
he
try
to
explain
a
concept
or
a
principle
that
held
his
interest
job
also
have
an
intensity
driven
by
whatever
his
late
passion
might
be
he
would
stand
very
close
to
whomever
he
be
talk
to
invade
the
person
space
as
he
pour
forth
about
his
new
discovery
and
he
be
nearly
impossible
to
avoid
once
he
make
up
his
mind
to
buttonhole
you
much
later
an
acquaintance
say
of
him
try
to
have
a
conversation
with
steve
job
be
like
try
to
sip
water
from
a
fire
hose
steve
have
a
sharp
wit
but
rarely
laugh
not
as
a
boy
or
even
later
when
he
be
on
top
of
the
world
at
time
he
be
see
to
smile
but
real
uninhibited
laugh
be
few
and
far
between
this
be
always
a
major
difference
between
the
two
steve
wozniak
have
a
quick
wit
and
love
share
a
joke
it
be
one
of
the
few
thing
for
which
he
would
take
a
break
from
technology
a
few
year
later
he
ran
a
free
joke
a
day
service
in
san
jose
and
even
now
he
sends
out
joke
and
cartoon
almost
daily
to
a
select
list
of
friend
woz
be
immerse
in
computer
and
electronics
while
job
be
immerse
in
himself
job
almost
certainly
knew
by
then
that
he
be
adopt
and
this
knowledge
seem
to
have
fuel
a
quest
for
something
that
would
give
his
life
meaning
the
machine
that
wozniak
and
fernandez
be
complete
be
one
early
element
to
fill
that
void
woz
may
have
have
the
know
how
but
steve
job
certainly
have
the
gumption
when
job
have
an
objective
nothing
stood
in
the
way
of
his
reach
it
one
thing
that
do
not
change
over
the
year
be
his
chutzpah
his
aggressive
personal
willingness
to
wade
right
in
to
go
for
the
top
person
the
decision
maker
after
the
family
move
to

begin
to
realize
there
might
be
more
to

electronics
i
remember
my
first
day
on
the
assembly

to
the
individuality
of

homestead
high
school
be
a
low
squat
school
thrown
up
in
the
postwar
boom
that
hit
the
valley
it
sits
hard
by
two
freeway
and
be
the
kind
of
campuslike
school
that
california
specializes
in
land
be
never
much
of
a
problem
so
new
classroom
be
just
tacked
on
to
the
rest
of
the
school
when
class
begin
in
september
steve
job
and
bill
fernandez
arrive
as
freshman
the
two
friend
from
cupertino
junior
high
school
share
their
enthusiasm
for
technology
but
both
felt
at
a
distinct
disadvantage
because
they
do
not
come
from
heavily
scientific
household
the
school
offer
an
electronics
class
john
mccollum
electronics
land
the
pair
determine
to
enroll
in
it
together
they
become
wireheads
the
slang
name
that
silicon
valley
high
school
kid
give
to
electronics
club
member
have
a
hip
connotation
the
name
combine
the
drug
orientation
of
the
time
with
electronics
and
avoid
the
bumbling
connotation
of
nerd
in
silicon
valley
it
be
cool
to
be
into
electronics
four
year
earlier
steve
wozniak
have
thrive
under
the
authoritarian
and
practical
regimen
of
the
school
science
department
he
have
become
the
prize
student
in
the
electronics
classroom
the
president
of
the
math
and
the
electronics
club
a
winner
of
science
fair
award
and
the
designer
of
endless
electronic
schematic
for
job
the
subject
never
quite
caught
fire
and
as
he
go
through
high
school
he
grow
less
interested
in
science
and
more
interested
in
other
thing
i
only
vaguely
remember
job
recall
mccollum
he
kind
of
fade
into
the
background
he
be
usually
off
in
a
corner
do
something
on
his
own
and
really
do
not
want
to
have
much
of
anything
to
do
with
either
me
or
the
rest
of
the
class
but
i
do
remember
that
one
day
he
be
building
something
and
need
some
part
that
i
do
not
have
which
be
only
supply
by
burroughs
i
suggest
that
he
call
the
local
number
for
the
company
talk
to
the
public
affair
people
and
see
if
they
would
not
let
him
have
one
or
two
of
the
component
for
his
school
project
the
next
day
he
come
in
as
pleased
as
could
be
and
told
me
that
burroughs
be
send
him
the
part
and
they
should
arrive
very
shortly
when
i
ask
how
he
have
manage
that
he
say
he
have
call
the
main
office
collect
and
told
them
he
be
work
on
a
new
electronic
design
he
be
try
various
component
and
be
consider
use
theirs
i
be
furious
that
be
not
the
way
i
want
my
student
to
behave
and
sure
enough
in
a
day
or
so
the
part
arrive
by
air
freight
i
do
not
like
the
way
he
have

a
path
to
high

i
be
interested
in
eastern
mysticism
which
hit
the

about
then
at

there

when
the

he
continued
to

very
shrewdly
perceive

kottke
at

an
insecurity
that

himself
i
think

as
unusual
in
his
own
way
as
steve
be
softspoken
diffident
and
gentle
with
a
cascade
of
frizzy
tangle
hair
that
surround
his
head
like
a
mane
he
be
a
superb
pianist
his
cousin
be
the
pop
guitarist
leo
kottke
and

smart
enough
to
have
won
a
national
merit
scholarship
what
more
he
be
not
a
californian
but
hail
from
the
new
york
area
steve
devotion
to
the
philosophy
of
the
east
seem
to
be
tie
to
his
quest
for
other
truth
the
absolute
and
the
loophole
of
science
and
electronics
and
tie
as
well
to
his
own
identity
he
be
totally
determine
to
go
say
kottke
of
the
plan
trip
to
india
he
felt
some
kind
of
unresolved
pain
over
be
adopt
that
be
the
same
period
that
he
hire
a
private
investigator
to
try
and
track
down
his
mother
he
be
obsess
with
it
for
a
while
steve
suggestion
that
kottke
be
his
travel
companion
raise
a
problem
i
do
not
have
any
money
kottke
say
he
have
this
great
job
at
atari
and
he
have
thousand
of
dollar
so
he
offer
to
pay
my
airfare
which
be
very
generous
and
indeed
have
he
not
offer
it
the
trip
probably
would
not
have
happen
i
be
very
dubious
about
it
and
he
say
come
on
i
will
pay
your
way
because
he
want
someone
to
travel
with
so
i
call
up
my
parent
and
told
them
i
be
go
to
india
with
my
friend
and
he
be
go
to
pay
my
ticket
so
of
course
my
parent
who
be
worried
that
i
would
never
come
back
give
me
a
round
trip
ticket
and
plenty
of
money
after
the
stop
in
germany
job
arrive
in
india
barefoot
and
threadbare
this
be
how
he
chose
to
dress
as
an
expression
of
a
specific
ideal
or
aesthetic
in
india
he
be
confront
for
the
first
time
with
people
who
be
poor
not
the
way
california
hippy
be
poor
by
choice
but
poor
by
fate
it
be
an
eye
opener
for
him
as
it
have
be
for
numerous
others
before
him
the
complete
contrast
with
the
material
comfort
of
american
life
be
intense
and
shock
and
it
challenged
everything
he
thought
he
knew
up
to
that
moment
his
clothes
may
have
be
rag
but
they
be
western
clothes
and
he
have
something
more
than
go
native
in
mind
his
idea
be
to
make
the
journey
as
a
mendicant
a
spiritual
beggar
dependent
on
the
kindness
of
stranger
he
immediately
trade
his
t
shirt
and
jean
for
a
lunghi
a
loincloth
that
be
the
traditional
indian
garb
for
mendicant
and
give
away
everything
else
he
have
join
by
kottke
he
head
north
from
delhi
toward
the
himalaya
the
legendary
center
of

they
slept

abandon
building
and
bought
what
food
they
could
in
the
village
they
pass
through
true
to
form
job
bargain
hard
he
look
at
price
everywhere
found
out
the
real
price
and
haggle
he
do
not
want
to
be
ripped
off
recall
kottke
his
aggressiveness
with
a
woman
who
sell

nearly
cause
them
to
be
run

pocket
and
start
to
shave

i
be
completely

i
be
nineteen
year
old
in
a
foreign
country
up
in
the
himalaya
and
here
be
this
bizarre
indian
baba
who
have
just
drag
me
away
from
the
rest
of
the
crowd
shave
my
head
atop
this
mountain
peak
job
be
discover
his
own
truth
we
be
not
go
to
find
a
place
where
we
could
go
for
a
month
to
be
enlighten
it
be
one
of
the
first
time
that
i
start
to
realize
that
maybe
thomas
edison
do
a
lot
more
to
improve
the
world
than
karl
marx
and
neem
kairolie
baba
put
together
the
pair
of
travel
mendicant
take
off
again
after
only
a
month
in
kainchi
it
be
the
summer
high
season
when
india
be
hottest
the
dust
be
in
their
teeth
and
their
hair
and
they
have
grown
weary
of
the
poverty
they
saw
everywhere
it
would
always
be
remember
by
both
traveler
as
a
country
of
constant
hassle
kottke
take
up
the
narrative
there
be
a
very
famous
story
in
india
about
a
guru
call
baba
ji
he
be
kind
of
like
davy
crockett
over
there
he
be
a
well
know
mystical
yogi
who
keep
reincarnate
and
he
be
hundred
of
year
old
well
presently
he
be
incarnate
as
this
guy
harikan
baba
and
we
decide
that
we
would
go
visit
him
and
that
be
a
real
quest
it
be
a
ten
mile
hike
up
a
dry
desert
riverbed
over
boulder
and
along
a
trail
that
be
almost
impossible
to
follow
and
our
foot
be
rubbed
raw
from
the
sandal
and
all
we
have
on
be
the
lunghi
so
the
sun
be
merciless
and
finally
we
found
this
cliff
with
a
stairway
up
and
it
be
the
ashram
we
would
be
go
so
long
and
put
so
much
effort
into
it
we
be
not
about
to
go
away
even
though
when
we
get
there
we
both
thought
the
guy
be
a
bit
of
a
bozo
after
a
couple
of
day
we
have
have
enough
i
be
sure
he
be
a
very
far
out
guy
but
he
be
very
much
into
wear
colorful
sari
he
be
really
into
his
wardrobe
change
his
clothes
all
the
time
and
he
be
very
flowery
with
his
language
too
all
the
essence
of
existence
be
so
and
so
which
do
not
impress
us
one
little
bit
we
have
no
idea
what
we
be
do
so
when
we
left
even
though
we
knew
it
be
a
long
journey
we
do
so
in
the
afternoon
then
that
night
as
we
be
sleep
in
the
dry
creek
bed
along
come
a
thunderstorm
and
i
mean
a
real
thunderstorm
like
nothing
i
would
ever
see
before
there
we
be
in
our
flip
flop
and
thin
cotton
shawl
and
the
rain
be
beating
on
us
and
the
thunder
be
roar
and
the
lightning
be
break
all
over
us
and
it
get
so
intense
and
the
two
of
us
be
both
so
kind
of
out
of
it
that
we
decide
to
cover
ourselves
in
the
sand
there
we
be
wear
next
to
nothing
and
i
remember
us
hunker
down
in
the
sand
try
to
defend
ourselves
from
the
rain
pelt
down
try
to
dig
a
hole
that
we
could
crawl
into
so
that
the
rain
would
not
destroy
us
i
be
sure
that
be
the
high
point
of
the
trip
because
i
remember
us
pray
out
there
in
the
dry
creek
bed
in
the
middle
of
india
completely
disorient
all
our
rhythm
and
belief
shatter
where
we
be
sure
a
flash
flood
would
come
through
any
moment
the
two
of
us
pray
to
any
god
that
could
hear
us
dear
god
if
i
ever
get
through
this
i
will
be
a
good
person
i
promise
they
survive
to
continue
their
journey
they
ate
food
in
bazaar
kottke
finally
cut
all
his
hair
not
out
of
some
inappropriate
fashion
statement
but
because
the
louse
and
the
flea
and
the
filth
drove
him
to
it
they
want
to
see
tibet
so
they
head
up
the
mountain
each

scabies
in
the
town
of
menali
the
site
of
a
famous
spa
to
go
along
with
the
dysentery
they
would
have
for
a
while
but
kottke
also
have
his
traveler
check
steal
this
be
the
end
of
the
journey
when
he
go
to
the

in
new
delhi
it
refuse
to
refund

the
inner
fire
be
not
satisfied
job

work
toward
the
root
of
thing
in
a

way
when
steve

and
the
new
reality
of
electronic
game

and
engineering
he
remain
true
to
the
hippie
aesthetic
which
be
easy
enough
because

require
total
concentration
upon
the

determination
to
succeed
and
a
driven
attitude
all
of
which
job
and
woz
have
in
their
blood
the
design
for
break
out
be
complete
in
one
forty
eight
hour
stretch
the
company
thought
job
be
design
it
but
it
be
entirely
woz
work
steve
role
be
to
buy
the
candy
and
coke
while
woz
do
all
the

say
randy
wigginton
a
very
young
camp
follower
who
would
end
up
at
apple
true
to
his
past
achievement
woz
manage
to
do
the
work
use
a
ridiculously
small
number
of
chip
alcorn
be
impressed
and
paid
steve
the
he
have
offer
but
steve
go
back
to
woz
and
say
that
atari
have
paid
only
he
give
woz
his
half
so
woz
who
have
do
all
the
work
end
up
with
while
steve
job
pocket
afterward
alcorn
found
that
he
have
a
problem
we
could
not
understand
the
design
and
since
job
do
not
really
understand
it
and
do
not
want
us
to
know
that
he
have
not
do
it
we
end
up
have
to
redesign
it
before
it
could
be
ship
woz
do
not
learn
the
truth
about
that
transaction
until
a
year
later
and
the
story
become
a
wedge
between
him
and
job
on
an
airplane
woz
spot
al
alcorn
and
go
over
to
talk
to
him
enough
time
have
pass
that
woz
thought
he
could
admit
that
he
be
the
one
who
have
design
the
circuitry
for
the
break
out
game
that
have
use
so
few
chip
in
that
conversation
alcorn
make
a
passing
mention
of
the
he
have
paid
for
the
design
woz
realize
that
his
friend
and
partner
have
shortchanged
him
the
knowledge
be
so
painful
one
source
say
that
it
make
woz
cry
accord
to
alex
fielding
a
longtime
friend
of
both
steves
when
job
read
that
story
in
on
the
fire
line
by
bill
simon
co
author
of
the
present
volume
he
be
highly
annoyed
and
call
woz
to
complain
i
do
not
remember
that
job
insist
as
if
i
do
not
remember
meant
it
never
happen
steve
use
the
money
from
atari
whatever
the
amount
to
afford
a
break
head
for
all
one
an
apple
farm
in
oregon
where
his
new
age
buddy
from
reed
hung
out
steve
job
be
in
a
fantastic
frame
of
mind
as
he
head
north
he
be
work
in
the
electronics
industry
realize
his
lifelong
dream
finally
he
be
actually
do
something
actually
help
to
build
something
with
his
nose
for
component
price
the
result
of
his
time
at
haltek
the
blue
box
period
and
his
father
example
in
rebuild
and
sell
car
plus
wozniak
uncanny
ability
they
have
a
good
thing
go
they
would
do
it
once
before
with
the
blue
box
so
it
seem
as
if
they
could
probably
build
something
else
and
sell
it
but
what
should
it
be
with
the
publication
of
a
popular
electronics
article
in
january
announce
the
introduction
of
an
altair
computer
kit
the
first
arguably
personal
computer
have
appear
all
it
do
be
light
up
a
string
of

across
its

to
demonstrate
the
answer
to
binary

question
that
have
be
laboriously
hand
cod
into
the

bank
with
a
series
of
switch
but
one
local
teacher
with
foresight
bob
albrecht
decide
with
some
cohort
that
it
be
time
to
issue
a
call
to
form
a
club
menlo
park
be
the
hub
of
the

together
with
a

they
put

a
computer
hobbyist
group
to
share
tip
and
information
call
it
the

because
of
the
hefty

carry
the

decide
that
people
who
already
have

would
share
them
with
others
who
be
not

fortunate

in

as
more
of
the
kit
appear
steve

already
think
about
how
he
and
wozniak
could
profit
from
this
new
field
he
have
to
find
an

steve
high
school
girlfriend
be
living
in
a
tent
up
there
dan
kottke
say
and
there
be
this
zen
master
there
by
the
name
of
kobin
chino
steve
and
i
use
to
go
visit
him
a
lot
mostly
in
his
house
which
be
near
the
zendo
and
we
would
have
tea
and
sit
and
talk
kobin
be
a
very
far
out
guy
but
he
have
only
just
arrive
from
japan
and
his
english
be
atrocious
so
we
would
sit
there
and
listen
to
him
and
half
the
time
you
would
have
no
idea
at
all
what
he
be
go
on
about
well
i
thought
it
be
sort
of
fun
and
take
the
whole
thing
as
a
kind
of
light
hearted
interlude
but
steve
be
really
serious
about
it
all
this
be
the
time
in
his
life
when
he
become
really
serious
and
selfimportant
and
just
generally
unbearable
but
i
remember
one
time
we
be
sit
there
and
all
of
a
sudden
steve
say
to
kobin
what
do
you
think
of
speed
you
know
do
thing
fast
he
be
really
serious
about
it
and
be
really
into
this
idea
that
the
quicker
you
could
do
something
the
well
a
person
you
be
but
kobin
just
look
at
him
and
start
to
laugh
which
be
what
he
do
whenever
he
thought
that
something
be
irrelevant
i
thought
it
be
pretty
irrelevant
too
yet
steve
be
hooked
he
study
with
chino
for
several
year
and
consider
him
one
of
the
most
important
influence
in
his
life
year
later
chino
become
the
official
roshi
of
job
second
company
next
and
eventually
officiate
at
steve

master
secret
the
ability
to
answer
a
question
with
whatever
be
on
his
mind
impulsively
become
a
lifelong
habit
for
job
some
people
might
say
that
his
management
style
start
with
chino
because
his
study
of
zen
begin
the
year
before
he
found
apple
zen
with
its
emphasis
on
the
spontaneous
and
the
intuitive
synchronize
smoothly
with
the
chaotic
style
of
nolan
bushnell
at
atari
which
be
the
only
place
job
ever
really
work
to
a
personality
that
already
be
essentially
unbridled
and
uncensored
a
personality
look
for
a
method
to
make
sense
of
the
madness
of
the
universe
and
to
answer
some
deep
seat

the
attraction
of
zen
buddhism
be
enormous
it
offer
a
self
direct
approach
to
religion
which
be
crucial
to
a
terribly
self
important
young
man
he
have
no
need
to
depend
on
anyone
else
for
guidance
zen
fought
rational
analytic

and

for
a
young
man
who
have
essentially
no
formal
education
in
anything
this
be
important
and
zen
be
mystical
and
concerned
with
the
big
issue
zen
koan
like
the
journey
be
the
reward
appeal
to
steve
sense
of
truth
he
embrace
zen
buddhism
more
deeply
than
ever
and
kobin
chino
become
his
master
at
the
same
time
however
steve
want
to
be
a
businessman
he
want
a
business
of
his
own
too
young
and
definitely
too
inexperienced
to
know
what
he
could
not
achieve
and
rule
by
the
passion
of
idea
he
have
no
sense
of
why
something
be
impossible
this
make
him
willing
to
try
thing
that
wiser
people
would
have
say
could
not
be
do
he
have
a
force
of
personality
that
could
simply
overrun
objection
and
his
lack
of
realworld
experience
kept
him
from
know
what
pitfall
might
lie
ahead
the
willingness
to
attempt
the
unlikely
or
the
unachievable
be
one
trait
perhaps
one
of
the
few
that
he
and
steve
wozniak
share
woz
delighted
in
do
something
well
with
few
part
and
more
elegant
engineering
than
anyone
believe
possible
he
would
go
to
one
of
the
biweekly
homebrew
meeting
pick
up
an
idea
or
be
spur
by
a
challenge
that
someone
have
pose
and
work
feverishly
on
a
new
schematic
so
that
he
could
stand
up
and
talk
about
it
at
the
next
meeting
by
the
fall
of
woz
be
proudly
show
the
piece
of
a
new
print
circuit
board
and
by
the
end
of
the
year
he
have
built
the
second
of
two
board
both
design
to
drive
a
color
display
steve
job
be
impressed
maybe
this
be
what
he
have
be
look
for
maybe
here
be
a
product
that
he
could
build
a
business
around
of
course
in
the
hothouse
environment
of
the
homebrew
club
woz
be
just
another
energetic
enthusiast
and
as
other
member
start
to
mount
business
built
around
make
personal
computer
woz
rough
breadboard
engineering
slang
for
rough
mock
ups
of
product
attract
little
attention
steve
knew
well
and
he
have
faith
in
his
friend
engineering
prowess
he
talk
to
woz
about
turn
it
into
a
business
and
woz
agree
to
build
print
circuit
board
that
a
hobbyist
could
buy
and
then
load
up
with
component
to
create
a
computer
meanwhile
woz
continued
work
at
hp
and
job
continued
his
night
work
at
atari
when
they
be
sell
the
blue
box
everyone
just
call
them
by
that
name
blue
box
but
other
hobbyist
be
already
sell
circuit
board
wozniak
and
job
would
need
a
name
a
challenge
that
prove
tougher
than
they
would
imagine
wozniak
have
his
head
in
circuit
design
steve
job
the
marketing
guy
could
not
come
up
with
anything
that
either
of
them
much
like
one
idea
be
a
second
string
choice
that
grow
out
of
job
admiration
for
pop
lyric
and
all
the
time
he
would
spent
with
back
to
the
earth
friend
on
the
apple
farm
in
oregon
besides
apple
would
come
before
atari
in
the
phone
book
in
the
end
with
a
self
impose
deadline
for
deliver
partnership
paper
to
the
local
newspaper
for
publication
they
go
with
the
gentle
nonthreatening
hardly
serious
name
of
apple
computer
eventually
apple
would
fight
a
long
run
battle
with
the
beatles
over
the
name
a
battle
that
grow
much
bad
once
the
ipod
make
its
appearance
and
apple
move
to
dominate
the
music
industry
wozniak
bought
in
on
the

but
still
have
doubt
about
the
partnership
steve
job
the
hard
charger
have
to
keep
his

pumped
up
about
the
project
woz
do
not
want
to
give
up
his
day
job
and
his

question
whether
steve

be
someone
they
want
their

with
much
less
start

his
son
should
have
to
go
fifty

with
a
kid
who
have
not

have
gotten
married

few
month
earlier
at
age
twentyfive
be
fed
up
with
the
way
woz
have
turn
their
apartment
into
a
spare
part
depot
on
april
april
fool
day
wozniak
finally
give
in
signing
the
ten
page
document
that
give
him
and
steve
job
equal
share
in
the
company
with
percent
go
to
ron
wayne
a
job
buddy
from
atari
who
have
agree
to
lend
a
hand
but
none
of
the
three
not
even
steve
job
saw
this
as
any
grand
venture
they
be
not
take
on
the
world
their
big
vision
be
to
build
the
computer
board
for
and
sell
them
for
they
hop
to
make
enough
of
a
profit
to
earn
back
what
they
would
already
spent
on
have
woz
circuitry
turn
into
a
professional
design
for
a
circuit
board
that
could
be
built
for
sale
still
they
be
not
blind
to
the
future
possibility
they
call
their
first
product
the
apple
i
clearly
announce
their
sense
of
more
apple
to
fall
not
far
from
the
tree
the
first
challenge
face
the
intrepid
entrepreneur
be
the
same
one
that
have
face
most
entrepreneur
before
and
since
capital
together
they
could
come
up
with
only
cash
woz
sell
his
hp
electronic
calculator
for
steve
job
sell
his
volkswagen
bus
for
twice
that
but
the
buyer
paid
only
half
because
the
van
blew
its
engine
within
week
of
the
sale
together
this
add
up
to
a
very
meager
bankroll
the
picture
do
not
look
any
brighter
when
they
take
their
print
circuit
board
to
a
homebrew
meeting
one
thursday
in
april
woz
stood
up
show
the
board
talk
about
the
feature
and
sat
down
to
a
thunderous
lack
of
interest
then
the
situation
suddenly
brighten
set
the
stage
for
everything
that
lay
ahead
as
steve
job
later
described
it
the
guy
who
start
one
of
the
first
computer
store
told
us
he
could
sell
our
circuit
board
as
fully
stock
board
if
we
could
make
them
up
and
deliver
them
it
have
not
dawn
on
us
until
then
that
the
board
might
have
a
big
market
if
the
purchaser
do
not
have
to
solder
part
in
place
himself
the
offer
be
all
the
more
surprising
because
the
man
steve
be
talk
about
paul
terrell
who
have
start
what
would
become
the
first
chain
of
retail
computer
store
the
byte
shop
have
met
steve
at
homebrew
meeting
and
have
always
avoid
him
you
can
always
tell
the
guy
who
be
go
to
give
you
a
hard
time
terrell
say
later
the
byte
shop
need
product
terrell
be
impressed
by
one
demo
at
a
homebrew
meeting
and
told
steve
to
keep
in
touch
steve
show
up
at
the
byte
shop
the
next
day
barefoot
to
test
the
level
of
interest
job
be
bowl
over
by
the
response
terrell
say
he
would
pay
for
apple
computer
and
he
want
fifty
of
them
an
order
worth
that
be
the
big
single
episode
in
all
of
the
company
history
say
wozniak
nothing
in
subsequent
year
be
so
great
and
so
unexpected
they
be
in
business
or
almost
before
they
could
build
the
computer
they
have
to
have
part
and
before
they
could
buy
the
part
they
have
to
have
money
or
at
least
credit
with
the
order
in
his
back
pocket
steve
travel
tirelessly
all
over
the
valley
look
for
funding
after
a
string
of
turndown
he
approach
a
big
supply
house
kierulff
electronics
bob
newton
the
kierulff
manager
remembers
steve
as
an
aggressive
little
kid
who
do
not
present
himself
very
professionally
but
he
be
impressed
by
steve
drive
intensity
and
say
he
would
check
with
terrell
to
confirm
the
order
anyone
less
determine
than
steve
job
would
have
say
okay
i
will
call
back
in
a
few
day
and
left
steve
refuse
to
leave
until
newton
have
make
the
call
terrell
it
turn
out
be
at
an
electronics
convention
where
newton
finally
reach
him
and
get
confirmation
that
the
skinny
youngster
sit
at
his
desk
really
do
have
a
purchase
order
for
that
be
good
enough
newton
give
steve
a
credit
line
to
purchase
up
to
worth
of
kierulff
product
but
the
credit
be
for
only
thirty
day
somehow
steve
would
have
to
either
deliver
finish
computer
and
collect
the
money
to
pay
for
part
or
come
up
with
another
source
of
money
within
a
month
either
too
rash
to
understand
the
risk
or
too
unconcerned
to
care
that
he
might
not
be
able
to
raise
the
money
in
time
steve
accepted
the
term
perhaps
the
best
description
of
high
tech
in
that
era
come
from
dick
olson
whose
company
assemble
circuit
board
by
stuff
attach
electronic
component
to
them
the
barefoot
steve
job
in
his
usual
torn
jean
walk
in
one
day
to
buy
olson
service
on
credit
olson
be
not
put
off
comment
later
i
have
learn
one
thing
about
the
electronics
business
by
then
you
ca
not
judge
anybody
by
how
young
they
be
or
how
they
look
the
best
engineer
do
not
fit
any
mold
not
long
afterward
steve
show
up
at
the
byte
shop
in
palo
alto
with
a
dozen
work
computer
board
one
quarter
of
the
terrell
order
terrell
be
not
happy
it
be
a
small
matter
of
miscommunication
he
have
order
computer
what
steve
try
to
deliver
be
plain
board
no
case
no
power
supply
no
keyboard
no
monitor
as
far
as
steve
and
woz
be
concerned
a
fully
load
circuit
board
be
a
computer
yet
despite
the
misunderstand
the
board
give
terrell
one
more
product
to
offer
customer
he
accepted
the
board
and
write
a
check
for
that
represent
a
profit
for
the
partnership
of
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
fledgling
company
have
deliver
about
apple
be
represent
nearly
in
revenue
wozniak
make
almost
as
much
from
apple
as
he
have
from
his
day
job
at
hp
yet
he
have
no
thought
of
walk
away
from
the
security
of
the
regular
hp
paycheck
in
the
fall
of
steve
job
work
very
long
day
at
find
the
best
hardware
deal
and
drum
up
new
retail
outlet
he
be
also
look
for
investor
and
for
reliable
people
to
help
build
the
grow
company
he
be
back
together
again
with
his
high
school
girlfriend
chris
ann
she
and
steve
be
still
pursue
the
way
of
zen
buddhism
and
at
the
zendo
they
occasionally
ran
into
california
governor
jerry
brown
another
zen
devotee
by
this
time
the
apple
i
be
not
sell
very
well
at
the
byte
shop
and
paul
terrell
be
think
of
drop
the
line
that
do
not
deter
steve
competitor
be
make
headway
and
he
be
determine
to
outdo
them
meanwhile
woz
much
to
the
continue
chagrin
of
his
wife
have
cover
nearly
every
surface
in
their
kitchen
with
piece
for
the
new
computer
he
be
design
which
eventually
become
the
apple
ii
he
have
come
up
with
a
clever
way
to
send
color
signal
to
a
television
set
and
be
determine
to
provide
plenty
of
extra
expansion
slot
that
would
enable
user
to
add
card
to
increase
the
functionality
of
their
machine
that
turn
out
to
be
a
brilliant
decision
but
not
for
a
reason
anyone
would
have
guess
at
the
time
the
expansion
slot
would
give
developer
an
opportunity
to
coattail
on
the
success
of
the
apple
ii
by
provide
card
for
the
computer
increase
the
value
of
the
purchaser
machine
while
building
huge
revenue
for
one
company
after
another
woz
and
job
also
make
a
key
decision
about
the
operating
system
the
competitive
altair
computer
use
a
version
of
the
basic
program
language
that
have
be
write
by
a
harvard
dropout
bill
gate
and
his
sidekick
paul
allen
which
they
be
sell
to
computer
manufacturer
at
for
each
machine
it
be
instal
on
a
cost
the
buyer
have
to
foot
the
two
steves
determine
to
provide
a
language
that
would
be
free
to
the
user
and
would
be
store
on
a
chip
on
the
circuit
board
instead
of
the
customer
have
to
first
load
the
operating
system
each
time
he
or
she
turn
on
the
computer
before
be
able
to
do
anything
useful
the
apple
ii
would
load
its
operating
system
automatically
make
startup
much
easy
and
more
intuitive
for
the
nontechnical
user
this
make
the
apple
machine
the
toast
of
a
new
generation
of
hacker
who
could
write
program
for
the
computer
as
soon
as
they
unpacked
it
and
set
it
up
because
microsoft
supply
this
version
of
basic
too
the
apple
ii
be
the
seattle
company
most
profitable
computer
platform
until
the
ibm
pc
come
along
another
key
innovation
grow
out
of
steve
job
decision
that
the
new
computer
should
be
quiet
it
would
have
no
fan
that
be
a
fairly
radical
notion
anyone
else
might
have
thought
the
idea
absurd
but
steve
just
charge
ahead
his
conviction
grow
as
a
result
of
all
the
time
he
would
spent
study
zen
and
meditate
he
found
the
noise
of
a
fan
distract
and
in
his
intuitive
way
be
certain
that
consumer
would
be
much
more
willing
to
buy
a
computer
that
do
not
sit
on
the
desk
and
churn
loudly
the
main
source
of
heat
in
a
computer
be
the
power
supply
get
rid
of
the
fan
would
not
be
possible
without
a
different
type
of
power
supply
there
be
just
one
problem
no
suitable
unit
be
available
anywhere
that
do
not
deter
steve
he
simply
go
on
a
hunt
to
find
somebody
who
could
design
one
for
him
the
man
he
found
be
rod
holt
a
forty
something
chain
smoking
socialist
from
the
atari
crowd
who
want
to
charge
a
day
we
can
afford
you
absolutely
no
problem
steve
assure
him
even
though
they
be
essentially
out
of
money
undeterred
by
reality
steve
be
try
to
bring
the
apple
ii
to
life
on
nothing
more
than
moxie
and
energy
he
just
con
me
into
work
holt
say
and
work
he
diddays
night
and
weekend
week
after
week
the
time
that
holt
ordinarily
would
have
be
out
race
motorcycle
he
instead
spent
invent
a
new
power
supply
for
steve
job
to
replace
the
conventional
linear
unit
which
be
heavy
hot
and
base
on
technology
more
than
fifty
year
old
holt
struck
out
in
a
new
direction
he
create
a
switch
power
supply
that
be
much
more
complex
but
be
also
lighter
small
and
cooler
the
design
substantially
reduce
the
size
require
for
the
computer
case
and
met
steve
job
demand
of
make
a
fan
unnecessary
it
also
revolutionize
the
way
that
power
be

electronics
product
in
october
two
men
from
commodore
come
to
see
job
at
the
garage
where
apple
have
move
its

and
they
want
to
talk
buy
out
a
canadian
calculator
company
the
firm
have
bought
another
hobbyist
computer
base
on
the
same
chip
that
the
apple
ii
use
the
mo
and
be
look
to
expand
steve
be
willing
to
consider
it
he
name
the
price
commodore
stock
and
salary
of
for
both
woz
and
himself
the
deal
fell
through
but
you
have
to
wonder
what
steve
job
and
steve
wozniak
would
have
do
with
the
rest
of
their
life
if
commodore
have
paid
the
price
and
make
steve
and
woz
employee
by
summer
woz
have
make
significant
stride
in
design
the

with
the
success
of
the

i
the
two
friend
have
create
as
well
as
the

they
be
prim
to
bring
their

they
take
along
a
work
mock
up

plus
a
cassette
interface
card
the
precursor
of

to
store

that
never
work
very
well
for
the
two
steves
the

become
a
very
humble
experience
it
start
on
a
red
eye
flight
to
philadelphia
on
the

in
addition
to

a
number
of

he
have

envision
for

it
would
cost
a

it

he

a
result
of
attend
their

show
the

jump
of

be
that
it

a

it
be
fully

have
its

its

and
you
could
actually
sit
down
and
use
it
and
that
be
the
breakthrough
of
the

that
it
look

a

product
you
do
not
have
to
be

that
be
what
the

be
all
about

mount

an
almost

determination
to
make

a

in

characteristic
lay
both
the
seed
that
would
make

a
success
and
the
poison
that
would
turn
so
many
people
into
steve
job
enemy
one
unanswerable
question
be
where
do
good
taste
come
from
that
fall
the
semiconductor
company
intel
ran
a
clever
attentiongetting
advertising
campaign
that
ignore
the
usual
technical
claim
for
its
product
and
instead
rely
on
symbol
poker
chip
hamburger
and
race
car
steve
job
be
immediately
struck
by
the
imagination
that
this
represent
and
the
way
it
spoke
directly
to
the
reader
this
one
ad
would
shape
his
attitude
toward
advertising
for
all
the
year
ahead
he
call
the
intel
marketing
department
and
manage
to
find
out
that
the
regis
mckenna
agency
have
create
the
campaign
steve
call
the
agency
and
ask
to
speak
to
mckenna
but
be
instead
shunt
to
the
man
responsible
for
handle
new
account
frank
burge
frank
listen
politely
to
steve
description
of
his
company
and
where
he
want
to
take
it
and
then
he
try
to
explain
why
apple
be
not
yet
ready
to
be
represent
by
an
agency
with
the
stature
of
mckenna
undissuaded
every
day
for
the
next
week
steve
call
burge
and
badger
him
about
come
over
to
see
the
new
apple
product
finally
steve
simply
wore
him
down
as
i
be
drive
over
to
the
garage
i
be
think
holy
christ
this
guy
be
go
to
be
something
else
what
the
least
amount
of
time
i
can
spend
with
this
clown
without
be
rude
and
then
get
back
to
something
more
profitable
for
about
two
minute
i
be
just
think
of
escape
then
in
about
three
minute
two
thing
hit
me
first
he
be
an
incredibly
smart
young
man
second
i
do
not
understand
a
fiftieth
of
what
he
be
talk
about
incredibly
smart
be
not
enough
however
and
the
agency
still
turn
him
down
steve
be
determine
though
he
call
mckenna
office
three
or
four
time
a
day
mckenna
secretary
probably
get
fed
up
answer
the
call
and
just
to
stop
the
persistent
young
man
from
bother
her
pressure
her
bos
mckenna
take
the
call
and
be
persuade
to
let
job
come
in
and
talk
to
him
the
two
steves
go
together
during
the
conversation
job
mention
an
article
that
woz
have
be
work
on
for
a
hobbyist
magazine
and
mckenna
ask
to
look
at
the
draft
advise
that
it
not
be
too
technical
wozniak
bristling
blurt
out
i
do
not
want
any
pr
man
touch
my
copy
to
which
mckenna
retort
that
then
they
have
both
well
get
out
job
calm
the
ruffle
feather
and
convince
mckenna
that
they
be
indeed
a
viable
company
with
a
superb
product
and
that
he
should
take
them
on
when
mckenna
prove
reluctant
job
pull
his
now
customary
tactic
of
refuse
to
leave
the
office
until
mckenna
consent
to
handle
the
account
steve
be
so
persuasive
that
regis
mckenna
in
a
decision
that
would
turn
out
to
be
hugely
beneficial
for
all
of
them
agree
to
accept
apple
computer
as
a
client
for
regis
mckenna
it
be
clear
from
the
begin
that
apple
would
be
able
to
grow
its
sale
only
by
reach
beyond
the
hobbyist
market
and
this
path
would
require
advertising
in
a
widely
see
visible
publication
where
no
electronics
company
have
dare
to
go
before
mckenna
want
national
attention
to
make
the
medium
sit
up
and
take
notice
of
the
little
company
with
the
garage
built
computer
where
would
you
advertise
to
achieve
a
goal
like
that
regis
have
the
answer
all
of
his
study
show
that
computer
be
bought
by
men
so
the
advertising
should
go
somewhere
with
a
high
male
readership
he
chose
playboy
magazine
apple
computer
now
have
a
capable
brilliant
agency
and
an
astute
medium
selection
there
be
just
one
problem
the
company
do
not
have
enough
money
to
advertise
in
playboy
money
mean
something
different
in
silicon
valley
it
simply
do
the
annals
of
the
valley
be
fill
with
story
of
people
who
be
at
the
right
place
at
the
right
time
still
find
work
capital
be
another
matter
get
those
lucky
enough
to
become
wealthy
in
silicon
valley
to
open
their
wallet
be
a
dance
of
an
altogether
different
kind
which
eventually
would
be
call
venture
capital
back
then
it
be
just
difficult
mckenna
suggest
that
steve
talk
with
a
board

of
his

a

job
he
be

very
big
difference
markkula
understood
the
effect
that
the
microprocessor
might
have
on
the
world
he
understood
that
it
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
someone
come
up
with
the
right
computer
one
that
make
use
of

and
do
something
more
thrill
than

the
time
or
add

of
number
and
because
he
have
work
for
a
company
that
supply
the
consumer
electronics
world
he
sense
how
explosive
the
development
of
a
new
item
could
be
when
the
partner
show
him
their
new
machine

ran
through
a

display
markkula

them
draw
up
a

get
the
venture
off
the

in
markkula
he
recognize
the

unassuming
guy
that
he
knew
he
could
overpower
steve

him
that
they
could

poolside
at

home
on
january
where
mike
and
the
two
steves
spent
the
day
argue
before
finally
signing
the
paper
that
turn
apple
computer
company
into
a
corporation
part
of
the
deal
that
markkula
insist
on
be
that
steve
job
and
woz
would
become
full
time
apple
employee
woz
would
finally
have
to
bite
the
bullet
and
leave
the
security
of
his
job
at
hp
but
there
be
not
any
need
to
discus
the
name
apple
be
already
too
well
know
to
even
think
about
change
it
markkula
introduce
the
team
to
mike
scott
an
executive
at
chipmaker
national
semiconductor
quite
the
opposite
of
amiable
markkula
scott
have
the
rough
edge
and
sharp
quality
of
a
streetsmart
guy
who
have
succeed
on
gut
and
determination
he
and
job
be
cut
from
different
cloth
job
do
not
like
scott
and
what
loom
ahead
be
year
of
management
struggle
nonetheless
scott
be
hire
with
the
title
of
president
because
there
be
already
a
mike
he
take
the
nickname
scotty
and
join
bill
fernandez
randy
wigginton
chris
espinosa
and
rod
holt
as
the
early
employee
in
the
trench
the
presidential
salary
would
be
this
be
more
than
any
of
the
three
major
shareholder
earn
but
the
power
reside
with
woz
job
and
markkula
and
scott
knew
it
job
and
scott
fought
over
many
thing
some
important
some
trivial
who
would
sign
the
purchase
order
how
the
office
would
be
laid
out
the
color
of
the
workbench
they
even
fought
over
the
award
of
employee
number
job
be
upset
that
he
be
designate
employee
number
two
to
wozniak
number
one
in
tear
he
demand
that
he
be
give
number
zero
job
finally
won
that
round
but
not
until
a
good
deal
later
when
scott
be
fire
at
one
point
scotty
take
job
out
into
the
parking
lot
for
a
walk
which
be
where
most
of
the
company
important
decision
be
make
but
this
be
not
about
a
company
decision
scotty
brought
up
the
delicate
matter
of
body
odor
job
deeply
dedicate
to
the
fruitarian
diet
be
sure
that
because
of
the
fruit
he
do
not
need
to
shower
the
gist
of
the
message
be
that
no
one
in
the
office
could
stand
to
work
near
him
as
apple
sprang
to
life
as
a
corporation
two
steve
job
trait
come
into
focus
his
drive
for
perfection
and
the
twin
trait
of
impatience
he
could
not
understand
why
everything
he
want
seem
to
take
so
long
this
be
especially
true
about
the
mysterious
art
of
write
software
an
even
great
problem
because
steve
have
so
little
understand
of
the
process
and
even
less
awareness
of
the
equally
demand
chore
of
comb
the
line
of
code
for
bug
bad
the
company
entire
program
staff
be
make
up
of
two
kid
who
be
even
young
than
steve
randy
wigginton
start
program
for
apple
while
still
in
high
school
and
he
remembers
i
be
just
this
kid
to
him
i
be
work
for
an
hour
and
i
would
get
up
at
in
the
morning
and
work
from
then
until
i
go
to
school
then
come
back
after
school
and
work
until
or
at
night
but
randy
have
his
eye
open
when
thing
start
to
come
unglued
between
the
two
steves
the
friendship
between
woz
and
job
dissolve
in
that
period
by
the
time
of
the
apple
ii
introduction
there
be
not
much
pretense
left
steve
job
strength
be
that
he
be
always
concerned
with
the
end
user
how
thing
would
look
onscreen
what
the
case
be
like
but
the
way
he
go
about
tell
us
be
so
superior
that
we
hat
him
if
they
could
not
agree
on
much
else
at
least
job
woz
markkula
and
scotty
be
all
in
accord
that
the

need
to
make
a

at
the
upcoming
west

have
have
the
foresight
to
sign
up
early
early
enough
to
capture
a
booth
position
directly
opposite
the

the
first
thing
people
would
see
as
they
walk
in

that
wigginton
wozniak
and
the
other
programmer
chris
espinosa
have
write
the
contrast
would
be
enormous
between
the
apple
display
and
the
fold
table
with
handwritten
sign
that
other
company
would
be
use
the
same
kind
of
makeshift
arrangement
that
job
and
woz
themselves
have
set
up
at
their
first
show
with
the
apple
i
only
six
month
earlier
at

to
look
like
a
klh
stereo
an
integrate
dorm
unit
then
popular
that
have
an
appeal
physical
design
when
he
saw
the
case
he
be
furious
they
look
dreadful
he
set
the
small
crew
of
the
faithful
apple
employee
to
work
sand
scrap
and
spray
painting
the
next
morning
when
the
door
to
the
faire
be
thrown
open
at
a
m
the
first
visitor

the

when

outdone

once
again
with
a
design
that
crammed
onto
the

an
unheard
of

overbear
demand
that
every

do
with
a
neat
attractive
straight
line
give
the
workmanship
a
quality
look
that
be
as

and
surprising
as
it
be
unsurpassed
people
crowd
around

almost
dapper
in
his
first
suit
have
to
continually
whip
away
the
drapery
to
prove
that
there
be
no
big
computer
hidden
out
of
sight
after
the
faire
we
have
a
sense
of
exhilaration
for
have
pull
off
something
so
well
not
just
for
apple
but
for
the
whole
computer
movement
that
be
the
view
of
programmer
espinosa
at
the
time
still
a
junior
in
high
school
within
month
apple
have
receive
three
hundred
order
for
the
apple
ii
already
triple
the
number
of
apple
be
ever
sell
but
steve
saw
to
it
that
owner
of
the
original
apple
could
upgrade
it
be
the
kind
of
issue
he
intuitively
understood
for
all
of
his
personal
complexity
he
always
held
to
the
ethic
of
what
be
right
even
when
it
be
costly
to
the
company
the
upgrade
policy
would
remain
in
place
until
steve
left
apple
that
summer
steve
job
live
in
cupertino
with
his
friend
dan

an
old

a

that
have
plague
many

and
would
plague
thousand
in
the
high

industry
in

a

the
main
challenge
that

its
competitor
from
the
start
what
a
computer
good
for
a

be
work
on

but
until
those
useful

appear
consumer
continued
to
see
the
computer
as
a
toy
another
problem
be
more
fundamental
in
operation
a
computer
must
carry
out
stream
of
instruction
in
sequence
handle
lot
of
incoming
data
and
spew
out
ream
of
result
at
the
very
begin
of
the
computer
age
instruction
and
data
have
be
enter
by
throw
switch

magnetic
material
encase
in
a
paper
or
plastic

be
begin
to
look
like
the
solution
of
choice
for
storage
at
a
landmark
meeting
of
the
apple
staff
in
december
mike

one
would
have
even
present
such
a
challenge
to
anybody
but
wozniak
the
timetable
be
impossible
but
impossible
be
a
word
that
woz
do
not
seem
to
have
in
his
vocabulary
with
the
kind
of
gusto
he
relish
he
tapped
young
randy
wigginton
as
a
teammate
and
threw
himself
into
the
project
christmas
eve
of
randy
say
woz
and
i
finally
get
the
disk
drive
to
write
and
read
something
and
to
celebrate
we
go
out
and
get
a
milkshake
the
night
before
ce
we
get

not
long
before
steve
begin
head
to
barbara
tiny
bungalow
in
the
hill
on
most
evening
by
this
time
while
he
still
consider
drug
an
essential
element
in
gain
perspective
he
have
all
but
give
up
use
them
that
represent
quite
a
change
chris
espinosa
recall
how
it
have
be
at
first
when
he
be
still
a
teenager
say
every
time
i
saw
him
for
year
he
ask
me
if
i
have
a
girlfriend
yet
or
if
i
have
drop
acid
that
be
all
he
care
about
it
get
so
that
i
would
be
embarrass
before
he
even
open
his
mouth
because
i
knew
what
he
be
go
to
ask
and
since
i
have
do
neither
i
dread
it
but
if
steve
attitude
toward
drug
have
now
change
his
relationship
with
apple
president
scott
have
not
thing
have
grown
so
bad
that
their
knock
down
drag
out
confrontation
have
come
to
be
know
around
apple
as
the
scotty
war
one
typical
example
for
apple
first
christmas
party
in
steve
go
wild
when
scotty
refuse
to
tell
the
caterer
that
they
should
plan
a
vegetarian
menu
scott
get
some
of
his
own
back
when
he
learn
that
to
relax
the
tension
of
a
tough
day
steve
like
to
immerse
his
foot
in
the
toilet
bowl
and
flush
the
tale
spread
throughout
the
company
make
steve
the
butt
of
many
joke
by
the
company
have
grown
to
a
workforce
of
about
sixty
people
order
continued
to
pour
in
and
cash
flow
problem
be
a
thing
of
the
past
steve
job
and
mike
markkula
be
look
ahead
they
thought
that
the
apple
ii
have
about
reach
saturation
it
be
time
to
think
about
a
new
machine
customer
feedback
have
already
point
out
some
need
improvement
though
it
be
a
little
hard
to
grasp
this
concept
now
the
apple
ii
displayed
only
capital
letter
on
row
that
be
only
forty
character
wide
both
of
these
shortcoming
would
need
to
be
correct
if
the
machine
be
go
to
be
consider
a
serious
business
computer
plan
be
laid
for
an
interim
machine
dubbed
the
apple
ii
plus
and
for
a
major
upgrade
that
would
be
release
as
the
apple
iii
steve
would
later
say
that
you
could
start
a
new
company
with
a
player
and
they
would
hire
other
a
player
but
that
as
soon
as
you
hire
a
b
player
he
would
hire
others
and
before
long
you
have
a
company
fill
with
b
player
and
c
player
in
the
view
of
apple
marketer
trip
hawkins
who
go
on
to
cofound
electronic
art
the
game
maker
that
be
already
happen
apple
have
become
a
company
that
could
do
no
wrong
trip
believe
it
be
the
camelot
of
business
basically
market
demand
propel
the
growth
of
the
company
and
it
cover
up
a
lot
of
mistake
so
you
could
have
incompetent
people
run
around
spending
a
lot
of
money
and
it
would
not
be
notice
because
the
demand
for
the
apple
ii
be
so
strong
inside
the
company
old
timer
call
it
the
bozo
explosion
that
problem
of
incompetent
people
infect
the
apple
iii
but
be
not
the
main
source
of
difficulty
steve
job
get
involve
in
the
apple
iii
in
a
way
that
be
really
disruptive
trip
explain
steve
have
take
it
on
himself
to
design
the
external
package
but
he
would
make
it
too
small
for
everything
the
team
have
design
to
go
in
the
box
steve
refuse
to
consider
change
in
the
configuration
of
the
case
when
the
apple
ill
be
ship
they
never
work
properly
the
fault
be
at
least
partly
steve
but
by
then
he
be
off
to
other
thing
and
have
wash
his
hand
of
anything
to
do
with
the
new

each
other
in
come
up
with
plausible
sound
explanation
for
what
the
letter
lisa
meant
in
computerese
few
people
be
fool
the
early
apple
software
developer
bruce
tognazzini
understands
the
powerful
frustration
that
must
have
driven
steve
toward
leap
into
a
project
of
his
own
markkula
never
let
job
have
any
power
no
one
in
the
early
day
thought
that
steve
be
run
anything
he
would
show
up
every
once
in
a
while
and
go
on
a
tirade
but
the
reason
we
stayed
at
all
be
that
none
of
us
be
work
for
him
we
be
work
for
markkula
or
scotty
but
not
for
steve
if
we
have
be
most
of
us
would
have
left
to
write
the
lisa
business
plan
steve
turn
for
help
to
trip
hawkins
the
marketer
who
have
be
hire
by
apple
with
his
mba
fresh
in
hand
the
plan
he
say
call
for
a
system
that
would
be
base
around
a
bit
architecture
and
be
to
be
a
high
end
office
computer
follow
the
model
of
well
engineer
hewlett
packard
system
with
that
vision
in
mind
steve
hire
two
hp
engineer
to
take
charge
of
the
design
fine
intention
steve
list
of
must
have
be
long
and
continued
to
grow
because
he
carry
the
title
of
vice
president
of
research
and
development
his
demand
have
clout
whether
they
be
reasonable
or
not
meanwhile
he
conceive
a
scheme
to
pry
open
the
door
to
never
never
land
the
holy
grail
of
computer
research
the
highly
secretive

palo
alto
research
center
refer
to
by
everyone
often
in
awed
tone
as
xerox
parc
one
apocryphal
story
say
that
he
approach
the
xerox
development
corporation
xdc
the
company
venture
capital
arm
and
told
its
representative
i
will
let
you
invest
a
million
dollar
in
apple
if
you
will
open
the

at
xerox
parc
xdc
stevan
birnbaum
say
that
do
not
happen
however
he
do
it
steve
manage
to
get
an
invite
for
himself
and
several
others
the
million
that
xdc
have
agree
to
invest
in
exchange
for
apple

may
have
be
the
key
at
the
time
parc
be
break
new
ground
in
personal
computer
technology
but
no
one
within
the
company
have
be
able
to
figure
out
how
to
build
his
or
her
great
idea
into
an
inexpensive
personal
computer
they
be
hop
that
apple
interest
might
lead
to
some
kind
of
joint
effort
it
do
not
turn
out
that
way
after
several
meeting
to
lay
the
ground
rule
for
admission
to
the
inner
sanctum
the
day
come
when
steve
scotty
computer
scientist
extraordinaire
bill
atkinson
and
four
other
apple
guy
be
escort
into
the
demo
room
parc
scientist
larry
tessler
figure
that
these
be
a
bunch
of
hacker
and
they
do
not
really
understand
computer
science
they
would
not
really
understand
what
we
be
do
just
see
pretty
thing
dance
on
the
screen
instead
tessler
witness
a
very
different
scene
atkinson
be
peer
very
closely
at
the
screen
with
his
nose
about
two
inch
away
from
it
over
my
left
shoulder
look
at
everything
very
carefully
and
job
be
pace
around
the
room
jumping
up
and
down
and
act
up
the
whole
time
he
be
just
very
excite
then
when
he
begin
see
thing
that
i
could
do
onscreen
he
watch
for
about
a
minute
and
then
he
be
just
jumping
around
the
room
shout
in
the
air
say
why
be
not
you
do
anything
with
this
this
be
the
great
thing
this
be
revolutionary
tessler
be
just
as
bowl
over
by
the
apple
crowd
as
they
be
by
the
parc
technology
nobody
else
who
have
ever
see
the
demo
care
as
much
about
the
subtlety
why
the
pattern
be
there
in
the
title
of
the
window
why
the
pop
up
menu
look
the
way
they
do
atkinson
explain
the
group
awe
i
be
aware
of
the
theory
behind
most
of
what
they
be
do
from
the
trade
press
but
the
thing
be
it
be
work
it
look
nearly
complete
if
they
could
do
it
then
we
could
do
it
it
energize
us
it
give
us
something
to
strive
for
what
apple
saw
that
day
be
a
display
on
which
the
user
make
selection
not
by
type
out
cryptic
command
but
by
move
a
pointer
to
designate
the
desire
onscreen
object
and
individual
window
for
different
document
and
onscreen
menu
today
this
be
the
standard
way
that
most
people
interact
with
computer
but
then
it
be
extraordinary
up
until
that
time
computer
be
control
by
typed
command
and
the
screen
generally
displayed
nothing
but
letter
and
number
here
be
a
graphical
user
interface
gui
as
it
would
later
become
know
unlike
anything
ever
see
on
a
computer
screen
before
and
well
yet
it
be
work
as
if
that
be
not
enough
the
computer
the
alto
also
have
a
word
processing
program
that
displayed
page
as
they
would
look
on
a
printer
have
an
art
and
draw
program
and
feature
a
new
kind
of
networking
scheme
call
ethernet
that
allow
many
machine
to
share
file
and
information
in
an
office
most
startle
of
all
a
gadget
be
move
by
hand
across
the
desktop
to
control
the
insertion
point
onscreen
a
mouse
while
this
be
not
brand
new
a
visionary
name
douglas
englebart
have
create
the
prototype
in
the
s
at
a
project
for
the
stanford
research
institute
sri
and
the
defense
advanced
project
agency
darpa
it
be
the
first
time
it
have
be
refine
into
an
electronics
product
as
oppose
to
a
demo
larry
tessler
have
put
on
demonstration
for
a
lot
of
folk
since
arrive
at
parc
but
this
crowd
be
truly
different
what
impressed
me
tessler
say
be
that
their
question
be
well
than
any
i
have
heard
in
the
seven
year
i
have
be
at
xerox
from
anybody
xerox
employee
visitor
university
professor
student
their
question
show
that
they
understood
all
the
implication
and
they
understood
the
subtlety
too
by
the
end
of
the
demo
i
be
convince
that
i
be
go
to
leave
xerox
and
go
to
apple
he
do
become
a
vice
president
with
the
additional
title
of
chief
scientist
on
the
drive
back
to
cupertino
steve
job
still
pumped
and
supercharge
from
the
visit
turn
to
bill
atkinson
and
ask
how
long
it
would
take
to
bring
what
they
have
just
see
over
to
the
lisa
atkinson
a
brilliant
programmer
but
short
on
experience
with
operating
system
and
user
interface
guess
oh
about
six
month
he
be
off
by
five
year
the
enthusiasm
generate
by
that
visit
to
parc
would
prove
to
be
a
blessing
for
everyone
who
us
a
personal
computer
today
but
it
be
not
very
good
for
the
fledgling
lisa
project
at
apple
the
people
who
come
together
to
build
the
lisa
manifest
an
elitism
that
be
quickly
obvious
to
the
rest
of
the
company
unless
you
be
wear
an
orange
badge
you
could
not
even
enter
their
quartersa
spank
new
building
along
bandley
drive
in
cupertino
but
elitism
do
not
guarantee
result
we
just
go
crazy
say
hawkins
everybody
steve
include
lisa
become
a
kind
of
kitchen
sink
where
we
be
try
to
do
everything
that
could
possibly
be
do
with
a
computer
and
suddenly
the
cost
factor
which
in
the
original
document
be
set
at
just
go
out
the
window
the
computer
be
eventually
when
release
we
make
two
radical
underestimation
one
be
of
how
much
thing
be
go
to
cost
the
other
how
long
it
be
go
to
take
to
do
them
here
that
stun
contradiction
in
steve
job
personality
be
in
full
play
he
could
infuriate
people
he
work
with
every
day
he
could
change
his
mind
with
startle
frequency
yet
he
could
keep
the
fire
burning
in
the
head
and
heart
of
the
brightest
people
in
the
company
one
of
his
favorite
statement
about
lisa
trip
hawkins
say
be
we
will
make
it
so
important
that
it
will
make
a
dent
in
the
universe
now
on
its
face
that
be
a
completely
ridiculous
idea
but
people
would
rally
around
stuff
like
that
especially
engineer
who
have
spent
their
life
bottle
up
in
a
lab
somewhere
miss
out
on
all
the
fun
steve
have
a
power
of
vision
that
be
almost
frighten
when
steve
believe
in
something
the
power
of
that
vision
can
literally
sweep
aside
any
objection
problem
or
whatever
they
just
cease
to
exist
the
reason
that
apple
succeed
hawkins
insist
be
that
we
really
believe
in
what
we
be
do
the
key
thing
be
that
we
be
not
in
it
for
the
money
we
be
out
to
change
the
world
that
would
happen
of
course
but
not
with
the
lisa
by
apple
have
burgeon
to
employee
then
then
more
than
with
plant
in
texas
ireland
singapore
and
california
for
most
of
the
employee
it
be
no
longer
a
place
power
by
passion
but
something
that
look
good
on
the
resume
in
the
late
summer
apple
organization
suddenly
change
again
the
company
have
grown
so
large
that
the
structure
be
unwieldy
work
in
secret
scotty
and
markkula
together
with
only
a
couple
of
key
manager
plot
a
new
structure
of
three
division
there
would
be
an
accessory
division
handle
printer
add
on

and
especially
a
new
disk
drive
the
company
be
develop
the
apple
ii
and
apple
iii
product
line
would
be
combine
in
a
group
to
be
call
personal
computer
system
finally
there
would
be
a
professional
office
system
division
with
one
flagship
product
steve
job
lisa
after
the
trip
to
xerox
steve
have
come
back
determine
to
build
all
he
have
see
into
the
new
lisa
but
the
team
of
professional
computer
scientist
disagreed
and
they
fought
him
tooth
and
nail
eventually
steve
would
win
that
battle
but
he
lose
the
war
instead
of
put
steve
in
charge
of
the
professional
office

the

until
then

to
the

include
steve
at
an

retreat
in
late
summer
and
it
come
as
a

face
steve
have
be
gun
for
the
title
of

which
would
have
make
him
the

it
have
all
be

birnbaum
say
to
this
day
he
be
still
impressed
with
how
two
very
young
men
without
college
degree
money
or
experience
go
on
to
build
a

a
much
repeat
quote
with
no
source
ever
cite
in
other
word
maybe
he
never
say
this
but
it
be
so
good
that
if
he
do
not
he
should
have
steve
supposedly
announce
when
i
be
i
have
a
net
worth
of
a
million
dollar
at
it
be
over
ten
million
dollar
at
it
be
over
a
hundred
million
when
steve
be
later
ask
about
the
effect
of
so
much
wealth
he
name
visibility
as
the
principal
factor
there
be
ten
of
thousand
of
people
who
have
a
net
worth
of
more
than
million
he
say
there
be
thousand
of
people
who
be
worth
more
than
million
but
the
number
who
have
more
than
million
get
down
to
he
be
not
only
super
rich
but
the
young
of
the
super
rich
to
the
public
he
be
an
icon
a
handsome
young
bachelor
with
a
win
smile
a
technology
groundbreaker
who
be
define
the
new
world
we
would
all
live
in
he
be
do
it
with
an
exuberance
that
be
still
a
little
coarse
but
this
would
smooth
out
before
too
long
it
could
even
be
see
as
one
of
his
charm
in
material
term
steve
could
now
have
whatever
he
want
more
important
the
money
carry
power
before
steve
have
be
only
as
strong
as
his
idea
if
he

not
convince
scotty
markkula
and
the
executive
staff
his
product
idea
and
goal
come
to
nothing
now
it
would
be
different
now
he
have
a
cudgel
to
wield
he
would
cement
his
position
and
gain
loyalty
he
understood
the
power
of
greed
and
he
would
use
it
somehow
the
people
who
have
already
give
him
loyalty
be
not
part
of
the
equation
steve
deny
option
to
many
of
his
peer
who
have
found
the
company
with
him
it
be
a
bizarre
virtually
incomprehensible
decision
that
fire
up
a
stream
of
anger
and
disgust
among
the
crew
who
have
with
little
complaint
put
in
the
painfully
long
hour
week
after
week
and
month
after

not

they
fare
well
out
of

as
well
as

woz

woz
end
up
give

the
wrong
people
woz
could
not

no
a
lot
of
people
take
advantage
of
him
strange
criticism
from
a
man
who
be
incredibly
stingy
about
give
share
that
could
have
make
his
family
and
closest
friend
fabulously
wealthy
he
even
shut
out
chris

that
the

gather
the
strength
to

he
invariably
refuse
steve
longtime
college
friend
dan
kottke

in
kottke
ask
steve
about

a
few
time
he
told
me
to
go
see
my
supervisor
kottke
be
so
distraught
over
the
situation
that
early
in
the
countdown
to
go
public
he
appeal
to
markkula
and
scotty
they
agree
that
he
be
deserve

grant
him
two
thousand

that
be
a
pittance
compare
to
the
rank
and
file
engineer
the
guy
who
have
come
in
after
kottke
who

after

amount

thirty
two

steve
have
intentionally
kept
one
of
his
old

from
receive
any

it
be
as
if
he
need
to
demonstrate
the
power
he
have
to
prove
that
he
really
be
the
bos
but
there
be
another
more
powerful
reason
kottke
with
his
gentle
manner
have
provide
chris
ann
with
a
shoulder
to
cry
on
after
the
break
with
steve
somehow
steve
have
decide
that
a
sense
of
loyalty
be
a
virtue
of
override
importance
intelligence
and
loyalty
these
be
the
two
quality
he
have
come
to
measure
people
by
kottke
pass
the
first
test
but
perhaps
as
far
as
steve
be
concerned
have
fail
the
second
if
kottke
be
not
go
to
be
loyal
to
steve
the
door
would
be
close
to
him
freeze
kottke
out
of
the
ipo
be
an
early
example
of
the
demand
that
steve
make
then
and
still
make
today
on
his
friend
associate
and
employee
if
you
be
part
of
steve
job
world
you
will
be
loyal
to
steve
in
all
thing
in
some
case
that
have
meant
be
sentence
to
a
jobsian
siberia
for
life
as
the
holiday

arrive
in
steve
felt
personally
unsettled
he
have
just
sign
his
child
support
paper
but
have
not
make
any
effort
to
see
his
daughter
since
her
birth
he
could
not
seem
to
finish
remodel
the
los
gatos
house
and
it
remain
nearly
empty
of
furniture
and
interior
decoration
at
work
he
could
make
snap
decision
about
aesthetic
but
when
it
come
to
his
personal
life
he
be
indecisive
bad
he
be
learn
that
his
new
role
as
company
whiz
kidwithout
portfolio
be
unsatisfying
and
unrewarding
as
the
lisa
project
scurry
along
without
him
then
a
computer
in
the
r
d
phase
one
that
he
have
try
to
bury
several
month
earlier
caught
his
attention
the
experimental
machine
be

eventually
with

on
his
property
in

jef
be
driven
by
the
possibility
of
create
a
small
inexpensive
computer
for
the
mass
he
have
form
a
small
group
and
with
amaze
speed
have
produce
a
work
prototype
over
the
christmas
holiday
of
in
keep
with
the
spirit
of
the
company
name
he
dubbed
his
invention
macintosh
after
his
favorite
type
of
apple
yet
he
have
make
a
mistake
the
name
of
the
fruit
be
spell
mcintosh
he
have
misspell
it
in
the
long
run
it
do
not
matter
the
computer
become
far
well
know
than
the
apple
ever
be
and
since
the
introduction
of
the
computer
the
name
of
the
apple
have
be
misspell
raskin
have
a
vision
of
a
computer
that
would
be
a
complete
can
solution
and
saw
his
macintosh
as
a
toaster
a
self
contain
appliance
with
no
add
ons
what
you
bought
be
all
you
need
he
also
have
very
strong
idea
about
ease
of
use
you
would
switch
on
the
machine
and
begin
work
immediately
without
the
bother
of
load
software
or
enter
arcane
command
the
machine
would
be
easily
portable
and
would
sell
for
around
which
meant
that
apple
have
to
be
able
to
build
it
for
about
he
saw
no
need
for
graphic
however
and
certainly
no
need
for
a
mouse
of
the
system
he
have
see
at
xerox
parc
the
only
thing
he
like
be
the
window
the
circuit
board
for
the
new
machine
have
be
create
by
burrell
smith
a
gnomish
self
taught
digital
hacker
who
have
be
discover
waste
his
talent
in
the
company
service
department
he
be
the
kind
of
eccentric
off
the
wall
talent
that
serious
computer
designer
disdain
secretive
and
aggressively
self
assure
he
be
cut
in
the
mold
of
woz
a
designer
in
the
hurry
up
mode
he
also
have
the
raw
mental
capacity
to
keep
all
the
element
of
a
circuit
board
design
in
his
head
at
once
and
then
again
like
woz
to
minimize
this
be
the
essence
of
great
digital
design
and
it
be
close
to
be
a
black
art
burrell
be
just
one
example
of
the
kind
of
people
raskin

with
raskin
have
assemble
a
rat
pack
of
computer
engineer

the
kind
of

most

to
scotty
about
steve

the

at
the

markkula

out

everyone
else
way
raskin
have

no

a

magical
uncanny
power
of

his
kool

him
believe
in
his
perception
of
reality
say
bud

a
few
year
later
it
be
a
combination
of
very
fast
comeback

the
occasional
very
original
insight
which
he
throw
in
to
keep
you
off

when
steve
set
up

a
halo

evangelist
someone
with
the

a
prime

that
type
of

one
morning
after
an

night

when
he
have
make
major
breakthrough
he
doze
off
in
his
sport
car
drove
into
the
back
of
a

okay
it

not
that
steve
be
worried
about
possible
delay
to
his
beloved
macintosh
project
atkinson
be
work
on
the

where
he
be
create
the
graphic
primitive
essentially
the
program
routine
to
draw
thing
onscreen
eventually
call

that
would
allow
apple
next
generation
of

to
look
like
xerox
steve
revere

because
he
be
a
certifiable
genius
bill
be
the

of
the
superstar
from
that
day
on
bill
atkinson
heart
be
with
steve
and
the
macintosh
steve
have
not
waver
from
his
deadline
still
hold
to
the
demand
that
the
macintosh
be
ready
for
the
market
in
twelve
month
because
no
one
have
ever
write
software
that
displayed
graphical
image
onscreen
the
amount
of
effort
require

that

picture
element
or
pixel
all
the
time
turn
out
to
be
prodigious
what
make
the
job
so
frustrate
for
the
team
member
be
steve
apparent
total
inability
to
overlook
any
detail
of
the
project
he
be
a
micromanager
to
the
nth
degree
he
care
passionately
about
the
small
of
item
eventually
the
final
result
be
well
for
it
however
the
path
be
tortuous
donn
denman
the
young
programmer
who
be
work
on
a
macintosh
version
of
the
program
language
basic
call
it
hand
on
management
steve
he
say
would
march
right
into
your
cubicle
invade
your
space
sit
right
down
and
start
play
with
whatever
you
be
work
on
he
would
make
comment
and
suggestion
about
make
something
easy
to
use
or
well
look
he
do
not
really
know
what
you
be
do
on
the
technical
level
but
he
be
real
interested
then
he
would
be
go
and
you
would
not
see
him
for
a
long
time
the
team
member
found
that
they
have
to
develop
a
strategy
for
deal
with
job
the
goal
denman
say
be
to
do
something
neat
to
show
him
by
the
next
time
he
come
by
we
all
have
a
joke
about
steve
if
you
want
to
get
him
to
agree
to
a
new
idea
something
that
be
a
good
idea
but
that
he
have
not
thought
of
you
told
him
the
idea
and
then
just
let
him
reject
it
a
couple
of
week
later
he
would
come
rush
over
to
you
and
tell
you
how
he
have
just
have
a
great
idea
and
would
proceed
to
tell
you
the
same
idea
you
have
told
him
before
as
far
as
steve
be
concerned
it
be
now
his
idea
so
he
have
no
problem
with
it
be
incorporate
into
the
design
though
the
whole
team
recognize
this
trick
of
steve
of
play
your
own
idea
back
to
you
no
one
knew
whether
it
be
calculate
or
something
steve
do
without
even
realize
it
a
phrase
sprang
up
in
the
group
to
describe
this
annoy
tactic
jef
raskin
say
we
call
him
the
reality
distortion
field
who
first
use
the
phrase
be
shroud
by
the
mist
of
time
andy
hertzfeld
think
it
be
bud
tribble
but
it
be
colorful
enough
that
writer
ever
since
have
continued
to
regurgitate
it
to
explain
a
wide
variety
of
steve
decision
and
mistake
yet
even
though
steve
do
not
understand
the
detail
of
the
technology
he
be
still
determine
to
put
his
own
personal
stamp
on
some
significant
part
of
the
project
the
single
area
that
do
not
require
technical
knowledge
be
the
case
he
take
that
as
his
own
domain
steve
style
of
work
on
a
problem
be
to
think
about
it
constantly
if
you
start
up
a
conversation
with
him
or
more
likely
he
start
one
with
you
he
would
immediately
launch
into
a
question
about
how
you
thought
the
problem
should
be
solve
as
soon
as
you
react
he
decide
one
of
two
thing
either
you
knew
nothing
significant
that
could
help
him
solve
the
dilemma
which
meant
that
he
would
say
nothing
far
on
the
issue
and
would
march
away
or
you
have
some
insight
into
the
situation
his
answer
even
if
he
thought
your
reply
offer
a
valuable
insight
be
usually
a
variation
on
the
phrase
that
be
s
c
his
stock
reply
to
either
situation
if
he
consider
you
a
worthy
person
he
would
explain
why
your
idea
be
garbage
and
his
be
the
only
right
way
to
look
at
the
situation
if
he
do
not
think
you
be
worthy
you
would
be
left
just
with
the
garbage
one
day
steve
go
into
a
design
meeting
with
a
telephone
book
and
threw
it
on
the
table
that
be
how
big
the
macintosh
can
be
nothing
any
big
will
make
it
consumer
wo
not
stand
for
it
if
it
be
any
large
hey
and
there
be
something
else
i
be
tire
of
all
these
square
squat
boxy
look
computer
why
ca
not
we
build
one
that
be
taller
rather
than
wider
think
about
it
and
he
walk
out
people
in
the
room
take
a
look
at
the
book
and
blanch
that
phone
book
be
about
half
the
size
of
any
computer
ever
built
it
be
impossible
burrell
smith
decide
the
electronics
he
need
could
never
be
put
into
a
box
that
small
steve
be
not
someone
who
take
no
for
an
answer
at
least
not
from
people
who
work
for
him
his
demand
unreasonable
as
it
sound
be
a
wakeup
call
for
everyone
on
the
team
steve
expect
a
revolutionary
machine
they
would
create
one
for
him
it
be
the
same
dichotomy
all
over
again
find
steve
annoy
frustrate
intolerable
and
yet
answer
his
clarion
call
march
to
the
beat
of
his
drum
willingly
even
gladly
over
the
next
week
that
spring
various
macintosh
case
mock
ups
be
try
out
on
the

vertically
orient

line
up
for
their
inspection
and
comment
the
basic
look
of
the
machine
be
quickly
set
and
it
change
very
little
over
the
year
it
met
steve
requirement
of
small
and
vertically
orient
the
basic
model
that
be
to
become
so
popular
would
offer
a
black

white
screen
and
one
built
in

drive
with
a
provision
for
add
another
in
a
decision
that
become
the
source
of
continue
controversy
throughout
all
the
year
of
the
machine
be
on
the
market
there
would
be
no
expansion
slot
to
add
to
the
machine
capability
with
hardware
card
it
be
as
if
he
have
take
part
of
the
toaster
idea
from
raskin
original
concept
after
all
there
be
not
any
upgrade
to
those
and
held
onto
it
religiously
even
though
it
be
a
bad
one
in
light
of
the
computer
that
the
mac
become
bad
it
reject
one
of
the
crucial
reason
the
apple
ii
have
be
a
success
expandability
for
chris
espinosa
reject
everything
woz
be
a
big
part
of
steve
motivation
on
the
mac
steve
knew
the
answer
even
if
they
be
totally
wrong
some
of
the
time
and
the
combine
force
of
his
personality
wealth
medium
fame
and
arrogance
set
them
in
stone
of
course
what
make
his
abrasive
personality
acceptable
be
that
more
often
than
not
he
be
right
in
the
aftermath
of
black
wednesday
a
whisper
campaign
built
up
against
scotty
with
the
flame
be
fan
from
the
human
resource
group
which
be
appalled
by
scotty
treatment
of
people
in
meeting
the
water
cooler
gossip
saddle
him
with
sole
blame
for
the
firing
while
job
and
markkula
who
have
both
acquiesce
have
left
him
to
take
the
heat
alone
when
people
turn
against
someone
little
thing
that
they
do
get
blown
up
into
major
grievance
and
add
fuel
to
the
fire
scotty
have
make
a
comment
one
day
that
black
wednesday
be
just
the
begin
leave
a
lot
of
employee
walk
on
eggshell
and
wonder
if
they
should
be
update
their
resume
and
scotty
probably
thought
he
be
show
enthusiasm
and
encourage
devotion
to
the
company
with
his
little
stunt
of
look
over
a
cubicle
wall
and
ask
be
you
work
your
as
off
the
native
be
thirst
for
blood
scotty
seem
to
be
seal
his
own
fate
when
he
return
from
a
hawaii
vacation
in
late
march
mike
markkula
call
scotty
to
a
sunday
even
meeting
and
told
him
that
the
executive
staff
have
request
his
resignation
markkula
would
take
over
as
interim
president
the
decision
played
right
into
steve
hand
scotty
be
a
potential
roadblock
for
a
macintosh
project
that
have
steve
at
the
helm
markkula
on
the
other
hand
while
smart
and
shrewd
would
never
be
successful
in
stand
up
to
steve
drive
and
determination
for
a
chairman
of
the
board
with
limited
real
control
steve
could
not
have
ask
for
a
well
turn
of
event
still
as
determine
as
ever
to
get
the
macintosh
finish
and
on
sale
by
his
original
target
date
steve
job
demonstrate
his
commitment
to
his
already
frenzied
team
by
bet
the
lisa
project
manager
that
the
mac
would
ship
before
the
lisa
do
it
only
make
the
atmosphere
in
the
texaco
tower
office
even
more
insane
then
in
may
steve
come
to
a
decision
that
in
hindsight
probably
make
all
the
difference
between
a
late
overblown
project
or
possibly
even
a
complete
failure
and
cancellation
and
the
stun
success
that
the
macintosh
eventually
turn
out
to
be
instead
of
develop
software
for
the
new
machine
in
house
steve
turn
to
outside
source
like
all
such
pivotal
decision
this
one
also
sow
the
seed
of
the
mac
lose
battle
with
the
ibm
pc
family
of
computer
for
marketplace
dominance
in
part
the
decision
may
have
grown
out
of
a
selfish
power
hungry
motivation
on
both
the
apple
iii
and
the
lisa
project
steve
have
be
pain
to
discover
that
the
large
and
more
bloat
the
team
become
the
less
control
and
influence
he
have
it
be
standard
at
this
point
to
have
apple
people
develop
apple
software
but
that
might
mean
he
would
lose
control
of
the
macintosh
project
as
he
have
of
the
earlier
one
he
be
determine
not
to
let
that
happen
this
meant
enlist
other
company
in
the
industry
to
help
him

first
come
to
mind
be
bill

sure
he
be
something
of
an
enemy
but
it
be
well
to
know
your
enemy
microsoft
be
already
a
success
but
compare
to
apple
it
look
more
like
a
wannabe
and
gate
himself
look
like
a
wannabe
who
might
be
dream
of
be
as
rich
as
steve
job
someday
gate
have
a
streak
of
the
daredevil
about
him
and
an
arrogant
show
off
attitude
that
make
him
appreciate
steve
willingness
to
espouse
the
unconventional
he
be
a
reserve
and
intensely
focus
young
man
but
with
the
twinkle
of
the
homebrew
hacker
about
him
as
well
up
to
that
point
microsoft
most
important

a

language
basic
that
ran
on
many
computer
it
enable

but
its
most
successful
platform
be
the
apple
ii
woz
have
include
a
version
of
basic
license
from
microsoft
on
the

of
the

and
as
the
machine
become
the
dominant

microsoft

soar
when
ibm
look
for
a
partner
to
help
it
write
the

for
its
new

unannounced
in
the

to
microsoft
steve
invite
himself
up
to
look
around
and
to
sit
down
with
bill
gate
and
paul
allen
at
their
corporate
headquarters
then
as
now
in
redmond
outside

seattle
at
an
early
spring
meeting
the
three
talk
about
their
goal
for
their
company
then
steve
launch
into
his
pitch
he
waxed
poetic
about
accessibility
the
mouse
and
the
desktop
metaphor
the
two
young
whizz
disagreed
violently
about
the
market
for
the
personal
computer
steve
foresaw
a
loose
intellectual
coalition
of
college
student
and
educate
progressive
home
maybe
combine
with
a
stillfuzzy
constituency
of
middle

and
secretary
gate
on
the
other
hand
be
strongly
influence
by
ibm
centrist
view
that
computer
be
utilitarian
business
tool
there
be
no
room
in
that
scene
for
the
emotional
attachment
to
computer
that
steve
job
described
steve
insist
that
word
could
not
adequately
convey
the
essence
of
the
machine
gate
and
allen
would
have
to
visit
his
lab
in
cupertino
and
see
this
remarkable
new
computer
for
themselves
after
steve
left
gate
and
his
team
decide
to
go
for
it
they
be
too
sharp
not
to
play
both
side
of
the
fence
they
could
see
the
lisa
as
a
possible
winner
and
steve
job
low
cost
version
just
might
be
a
runaway
hit
the
microsoft
crowd
arrange
to
troop
down
to
cupertino
and
stayed
there
till
late
afternoon
now
convince
that
apple
be
onto
something
special
bill

commit
his
company
to
write
major
program
for
steve

their
work
for

involve
create
system
housekeep

essential
but
not
sexy
now
application
program
those
be
the
sexy
project
that
could
get
a
programmer
heart
beating
fast
develop
the
killer
app
be
where
the
glory
lay
and
that
be
what
steve
dangle
in
front
of
them
like
a
carrot
they
snatch
at
it
microsoft
name
their
project
sand
it
be
base
on
a
vision
that
steve
spun
for
them
about
a
factory
sit
on
a
beach
where
sand
would
go
in
one
side
and
finish
computer
would
come
out
the
other
silicon
the
key
component
of
most
transistor
be
present
in
sand
as
they
be
work
for
the
relentlessly
unpoetic
ibm
personal
computer
which
be
about
to
be
release
that
summer
the
mac
give
them
something
to
dream
about
the
next
month
ibm
introduce
its
version
of
the
personal
computer
it
be
exactly
the
kind
of
computer
that
everyone
on
the
mac
team
be
expect
it
be
large
and
clunky
it
introduce
no
new
technology
it
be
difficult
to
learn
to
use
it
be
the
furthest
thing
possible
from
lisa
or
macintosh
the
mac
guy
go
out
and
bought
one
as
soon
as
it
be
available
late
in
august
then
they
tore
it
apart
all
of
them
be
relieve
that
it
be
as
inelegant
and
unwieldy
as
it
be
they
be
sure
that
their
new
computer
would
destroy
ibm
challenge
as
soon
as
theirs
be
announce
the
follow
year
for
his
part
steve
saw
it
as
a
battle
a
race
to
save
the
world
it
felt
right
for
him
to
be
the
underdog
the
unlikely
david
to
ibm
goliath
it
be
come
down
to
apple
and
ibm
he
say
once
if
for
some
reason
we
make
some
big
mistake
and
ibm
win
my
personal
feel
be
that
we
be
go
to
enter
sort
of
a
computer
dark
age
for
about
twenty
year
once
ibm
gain
control
of
a
market
sector
they
always
stop
innovation
they
prevent
innovation
from
happen
if
you
look
at
the
mainframe
marketplace
there
be
be
virtually
zero
innovation
since
ibm
get
dominant
control
of
that
marketplace
fifteen
year
ago
the
ibm
pc
fundamentally
brought
no
new
technology
to
the
industry
at
all
it
be
just
a
repackaging
and
slight
extension
of
apple
ii
technology
and
now
they
want
it
all
apple
be
provide
the
alternative
while
steve
downplayed
the
technology
of
their
computer
apple
also
take
out
a
famous
ad
in
the
nation
newspaper
that
combine
an
elitist
sense
of
the
company
destiny
with
an
overblown
prose
style
that
be
just
a
teensy
weensy
bit
too
self
righteous
and
self
serve
welcome
ibm
seriously
welcome
to
the
most
excite
and
important
marketplace
since
the
computer
revolution
begin
year
ago
and
congratulation
on
your
first
computer
put
real
computer
power
in
the
hand
of
the
individual
be
already
improve
the
way
people
work
think
learn
communicate
and
spend
their
leisure
hour
computer
literacy
be
fast
become
as
fundamental
a
skill
as
reading
or
write
when
we
invent
the
first
personal
computer
system
we
estimate
that
over
people
worldwide
could
justify
the
purchase
of
one
if
only
they
understood
the
benefit
next
year
alone
we
project
that
well
over
will
come
to
that
understand
over
the
next
decade
the
growth
of
the
personal
computer
will
continue
in
logarithmic
leap
we
look
forward
to
responsible
competition
in
the
massive
effort
to
distribute
this
american
technology
to
the
world
and
we
appreciate
the
magnitude
of
your
commitment
because
what
we
be
do
be
increase
social
capital
by
enhance
individual
productivity
welcome
to
the
task
it
be
a
very
smug
ad
especially
come
as
it
do
from
a
firm
less
than
one
tenth
the
size
of
ibm
as
event
would
work
out
ibm
release
of
a
personal
computer
be
very
good
for
apple
it
legitimize
the
market
it
brought
enormous
amount
of
publicity
to
apple
as
the
only
real
competition
to
ibm
it
strengthen
the
company
role
as
the
underdog
a
role
that
many
wish
to
identify
with
the
year
be
the
watershed
for
apple
in
term
of
name
recognition
as
the
year
start
less
than
percent
of
american
knew
what
apple
be
by
the
end
of
the
year
that
figure
be
up
to
percent
ibm
introduction
of
its
machine
no
matter
the
technology
be
the
best
thing
that
could
have
happen
the
fact
that
the
two
firm
be
so
very
different
one
californian
and
liberal
the
other
east
coast
and
button
up
only
serve
to
far
highlight
apple
the
introduction
give
the
macintosh
and
lisa
team
even
more
impetus
to
make
sure
that
they
brought
out
their
revolutionary
new
machine
soon
to
show
the
world
just
how
stodgy
ibm
be
and
how
brilliant
apple
be
by
comparison
of
course
it
do
not
quite
work
out
that
way
in
the
end
by
july
the
macintosh
be
begin
to
shake
down
the
basic
design
and
the
circuit
board
layout
be
close
to
final
the
machine
would
come
with
an
internal
disk
drive
the
same
one
that
be
use
in
the
apple
ii
it
would
have
kilobyte
of
rom
the
read
only
memory
use
by
the
hardware
it
would
also
have
the
same
amount
of
ram
random
access
memory
use
by
the
software
though
burrell
smith
have
devise
a
way
of
double
the
ram
to
kilobyte
that
be
secret
knowledge
however
talk
about
in
whisper
because
it
have
be
do
in
defiance
of
steve
job
who
have
decreed
that
there
could
only
be
one
memory
configuration
that
same
month
steve
complete
the
first
draft
of
the
macintosh
business
plan
it
call
for
introduce
the
computer
in
mid
at
the
same
time
as
the
lisa
and
the
new
model
apple
ii
the
price
of
the
mac
would
be
include
software
fall
to
for
the
mac
the
macintosh
would
achieve
first
year
sale
of
unit
steve
have
make
up
the
number
out
of
thin
air
and
have
repeat
it
so
often
that
it
become
accepted
as
fact
people
around
the
company
be
begin
to
wake
up
to
a
problem
that
steve
have
try
to
hide
a
problem
that
now
begin
to
smell
like
a
mackerel
rot
in
the
closet
he
be
target
the
macintosh
for
the
office
environment
the
same
segment
of
the
marketplace
that
the
lisa
have
be
design
to
reach
it
be
a
disaster
in
the
make
two
computer
reach
the
market
at
the
same
time
target
to
the
same
customer
that
be
bad
enough
but
one
of
them
the
macintosh
would
be
more
compact
faster
and
far
less
expensive
it
be
not
a
game
that
any
sane
product
manager
would
want
to
play
the
macintosh
be
still
be
carry
on
the
apple
book
as
an
experimental
project
the
time
have
come
for
steve
to
go
hat
in
hand
to
mike
markkula
still
serve
as
president
and
argue
for
the
macintosh
to
be
accepted
as
a
serious
project
when
he
come
to
the
question
of
market
in
the
plan
steve
slight
the
topic
with
a
dismissive
macintosh
be
aim
at
the
market
lisa
do
not
address
to
markkula
who
have
apparently
not
yet
gotten
wind
of
the
problem
and
besides
be
no
marketing
guru
the
explanation
apparently
pass
without
notice
the
power
of
steve
vision
and
the
good
business
sense
of
sell
an
inexpensive
machine
that
offer
all
the
power
and
the
feature
of
lisa
carry
the
day
back
by
markkula
approval
the
executive
staff
and
the
company
board
approve
the
change
of
status
macintosh
be
a
real
product
macintosh
be
official
steve
accepted
the
need
to
push
back
the
first
shipment
date
to
october
even
with
that
delay
the
schedule
be
still
as
unrealistic
as
ever
but
steve
could
not
see
it
he
still
would
not
let
practical
reality
get
in
the
way
of
his
determination
he
be
convince
in
his
own
feel
for
the
marketplace
much
later
he
explain
we
think
the
mac
will
sell
zillion
but
we
do
not
build
mac
for
anybody
else
we
built
it
for
ourselves
we
be
the
group
of
people
who
be
go
to
judge
whether
it
be
great
or
not
we
be
not
go
to
go
out
and
do
market
research
do
alexander
graham
bell
do
any
market
research
when
he
invent
the
telephone
of
course
not
in
february
steve
take
the
macintosh
team
to
pajaro
dune
a
posh
seaside
resort
on
the
ocean
a
hundred
mile
south
of
cupertino
for
the
first
of
what
would
become
a
continue
series
of
retreat
steve
job
open
his
appearance
in
front
of
his
group
by
write
a
slogan
on
the
board
a
kind
of
rally
theme
for
the
meeting
this
time
it
be
the
journey
be
the
reward
when
he
be
do
he
sat
down
and
for
the
most
part
just
listen
each
group
in
turn
update
the
rest
of
the
team
on
what
it
have
recently
accomplish
and
what
challenge
it
be
currently
tackle
these
event
be
already
something
of
a
tradition
at
apple
apple
be
very
much
like
a
club
accord
to
phil
roybal
we
would
have
these
management
retreat
at
spectacular
resort
there
would
be
a
couple
of
day
of
meeting
and
at
night
we
would
open
the
bar
and
dance
until
we
drop
this
be
not
like
work
in
later
year
the
macintosh
retreat
would
be
imbue
with
a
kind

psychological
test

set
of
question
two
of
them
be
how
many
time
have
you
take
acid
and
when
do

wimp
who

no
good
at
think
on

key
test

the
bandley

hertzfeld
if
you
be
good
enough
to
keep
up
with
them
you
be
a
viable
candidate
steve
be
not
only
very
rich
but
pull
a
quarter
of
a
million
dollar
a
year
out
of
the
company
in
salary
yet
he
refuse
to
let
any
of
his
engineer
receive
more
than
a
year
the
low
salary
of
any
engineer
at
apple
he
consider
anyone
work
less
than
eighty
hour
a
week
to
be
wimping
out
they
all
share
one
attribute
they
care
more
about
building
an
amaze
computer
and
shock
the
world
with
it
than
they
do
about
anything
so
ordinary
as
money
career
path
or
tradition
at
the
same
time
they
could
laugh
at
themselves
one
of
the
requirement
for
employment
be
a
love
of
pineapple
pizza
chris
espinoza
recall
we
actually
ask
that
i
mean
if
they
do
not
like
the
same
kind
of
pizza
as
we
do
how
could
they
come
out
to
dinner
with
us
the
relationship
between
steve
and
the
team
always
have
plenty
of
rough
spot
he
rarely
like
people
wife
or
girlfriend
he
thought
they
could
do
much
well
and
say
so
it
have
become
a
run
joke
within
the
group
that
eat
out
with
steve
be
an
exercise
in
embarrassment
first
there
be
the
issue
of
send
plate
back
he
rarely
accepted
the
first
plate
brought
to
him
he
would
find
some
reason
to
send
it
back
it
would
be
s
t
or
dirty
or
not
what
he
thought
the
waitress
have
described
another
plate
would
be
brought
and
often
that
one
would
go
back
too
it
be
like
a
power
trip
go
mad
some
screwy
internal
need
make
him
play
out
the
same
pathetic
scenario
over
and
over
the
waiter
have
to
grovel
it
be
as
though
the
god
have
shower
this
young
prince
with
money
power
and
adulation
but
have
fail
to
grant
him
humility
or
grace
he
be
an
unmannerly
brat
with
million
in
the
bank
then
there
be
the
uncomfortable
ritual
about
pay
a
restaurant
check
andy
hertzfeld
remember
one
typical
occasion
when
the
bill
come
steve
say
something
like
well
i
do
not
have
any
cash
all
i
have
get
be
a
credit
card
that
be
all
i
have
as
well
so
i
say
so
and
he
reply
great
you
can
pay
for
it
then
it
take
him
year
before
he
paid
for
anything
he
never
have
cash
with
him
and
whenever
we
go
out
with
him
we
have
to
pay
i
think
it
have
something
to
do
with
not
want
to
be
take
advantage
of
or
maybe
he
be
just
a
skinflint
mike
murray
offer
a
bit
of
his
own
psychological
analysis
steve
just
do
not
have
the
limit
that
the
rest
of
us
do
because
of
his
background
and
his
early
success
he
do
not
have
any
boundary
he
do
not
know
that
anything
be
impossible
because
well
he
be
always
be
able
to
do
anything
he
want
so
even
as
he
be
be
a
jerk
he
be
get
this
incredibly
seductive
aura
around
him
that
keep
you
bound
to
him
keep
you
near
the
flame
keep
you
on
the
team
if
steve
have
not
become
much
more
sophisticated
in
his
approach
to
business
his
personal
life
be
a
different
story
he
be
manage
the
transition
from

steve

be
expect
to
pursue
steve

by
avoid
unproductive
path
his
guy
work
in
splendid
isolation
and
they
do
so
at
a
pace
that
put
the
rest
of
the
company
and
the
entire
computer
industry
to
shame
they
would
bring
the
great
computer
ever
to
market
in
less
than
two
year
by
the
end
of
june
they
have
the
entire
design
on
a
computer
wire
up
on
the
lab
bench
ready
for
full
test
about
then
steve
be
get
nervous
say
martin
haeberli
a
chip
designer
steve
have
personally
hire
away
from
xerox
to
develop
an
integrate
chip
for
the
mac
and
burrell
be
get
nervous
because
we
still
have
nothing
to
show
steve
though
instead
of
be
frighten
by
the
tick
clock
ask
burrell
to
investigate
whether
he
could
possibly
design
a
macintosh
use
a
different
kind
of
chip
call
a
pal
that
would
create
a
great
number
of
dot
on
the
screen
burrell
disappear
for
about
a
month
haeberli
say
and
when
he
come
back
have
a
work
design
meanwhile
i
have
be
shepherd
the
original
chip
design
and
we
be
about
to
get
our
first
test
chip
back
unfortunately
they
ran
about
percent
slow
than
necessary
ultimately
the
decision
be
to
go
with
the
design
burrell
have
create
by
himself
in
a
single
month
the
company
that
would
have
manufacture
the
original
chip
vlsi
be
notify
that
apple
would
not
be
use
its
chip
after
all
vlsi
have
already
incur
huge
development
cost
overrun
the
budget
by
more
than
percent
because
be
a
supplier
to
apple
seem
so
valuable
and
the
company
want
to
ensure
that
it
would
be
a
long
term
relationship
steve
have
originally
sign
the
letter
of
intent
commit
to
a
deal
worth
million
now
he
offer
to
settle
for
the
offer
be
an
insult
but
job
be
adamant
and
vlsi
end
up
take
a
bath
and
write
off
a
huge
loss
the
macintosh
team
that
show
up
for
the
second
retreat
in
late
september
again
held
in
pajaro
dune
be
nearly
one
hundred
strong
the
slogan
steve
write
on
the
blackboard
this
time
accurately
capture
the
spirit
of
the
group
let
be
pirate
it
brought
a
roar
of
approval
then
he
write
another
line
that
goad
the
group
yet
fire
up
their
dedication
work
hour
a
week
and
love
it
he
could
probably
have
make
the
slave
building
the
pyramid
or
the
rower
in
a
roman
galley
thrill
to
be
whip
as
a
reminder
that
they
be
take
part
in
a
noble
effort
with
the
stagecraft
of
a
magician
steve
then
pull
out
a
sweatshirt
that
have
the
pirate
phrase
emblazon
on
it
and
pull
it
over
his
head
soon
everyone
at
the
retreat
have
one
of
course
no
one
pretend
this
be
a
democracy
a
handful
of
the
sweat
also
have
a
tiny
line
of
type
over
the
left
breast
macintosh
staff
they
might
have
be
a
merry
band
of
pirate
but
there
be
still
a
distinction
between
those
who
swabbed
the
deck
and
those
who
ate
at
the
captain
table
the
retreat
be
a
share
of
information
to
bring
everyone
up
todate
on
how
each
aspect
of
the
development
be
proceed
it
be
also
design
to
keep
the
ardor
at
a
fever
pitch
despite
all
setback
steve
be
determine
that
they
would
ship
the
macintosh
the
follow
may
no
matter
what
the
schedule
have
slip
but
he
be
certain
that
it
be
now
on
track
meanwhile
in
the
fall
of

and
steve
be
in
the
midst
of
his
infatuation
with
joan
baez
the
world
look
very
rosy
on
the
downside
be
the
still
unresolved
question
of
the
apple
presidency
steve
job
do
not
doubt
that
he
be
fully
competent
to
run
the
company
but
he
be
the
only
one
on
the
board
who
thought
so
a
lengthy
search
have
not
produce
any
interested
candidate
strong
enough
to
please
the
board
late
in

come
that
a
feeler
have
be
put
out
to
the
president
of

john
sculley
he
be
told
that
work
in
silicon
valley
be
the
equivalent
of
be
in
florence
during
the
renaissance
but
it
have
not
be
enough
to
convince
him
even
to
consider

something
quite
different
atkinson
now
have
the
title
of
chief
software
architect
for
apple

much
of
the
credit
for
what
make
the
lisa
and
the
macintosh
so
different
from
an
ibm
pc
their
on
screen
appearance
now
atkinson
be
fume
absolutely
beside
himself
with
rage
frustration
and
bitter
disappointment
that
he
could
not
keep
bottle
up
inside
ordinarily
mild
mannered
and
soft
spoken
atkinson
have
gain
job
trust
year
earlier
when
he
stood
up
in
a
meeting
where
steve

spew
some
outrageous
technical
gobbledygook
and
yell
steve

you
be
an
asshole
and
then
walk
out
steve
have
react
exactly
the
opposite
from
what
everyone
expect
he
call
atkinson
the
very
next
day
invite
him
to
dinner
and
the
two
become
close
friend
or
at
least
as
close
as
steve
ever
allow
anyone
to
become
now
atkinson
have
have
enough
bill
told
steve
that
he
be
quit
say
hertzfeld
the
only
witness
to
the
scream
match
that
erupt
he
be
upset
because
in

in
the
hour
of

there
be
not
a
single
mention
of
his

he
be
the
guy
behind
it
without
him
there
would
have
be
nothing
without
his
breakthrough
routine
to
allow
us
to
quickly
and
easily
draw
the
screen
there
would
have
be
no
lisa

no
macintosh
but
it
be
as
though
he
do
not
exist
he
be
cry
and
scream
and
steve
be

back
at
him
it
really
tore
me
apart
here
be
the
two
people

have
admit
to
himself
that
what

at
so
late
a
date
apple
consider
use
the
slot
for
a
more
conventional
commercial
but
in
the
end
decide
to
take
a
chance
on
the
spot
steve
be
ecstatic
it
be
all
go
his
way
all
that
money
would
be
worth
it
if
the
commercial
start
conversation
and
drove
thousand
of
people
into
store
to
see
the
macintosh
obviously
the
money
would
be
largely
waste
if
for
some
reason
the
macintosh
be
not
in
the
store
when
the
crowd
arrive
follow
super

sunday
nothing
could
stand
in
the
way
of
get
the
finish
product
into
the
store
and
not
just
the
hardware
itself
but
the
software
as
well
on
sunday
january
the
west
coast
software
programmer
and
tester
assemble
for
a
conference
call
with
the
east

team
shortly
before
that
the

have
face
the
hard
truth
it
have
barely
more
than
a
week
left
to
finish
the
software
and
deliver
it
for
disk
duplication
and
the
team
simply
be
not
go
to
make
it
the
alternative
be
ugly
ask
consumer
to
buy
a
great
new
computer
with
buggy
unstable
software
label
demo
during
the

the
reaction
be
not
what
they
anticipate
they
expect
a
typical
steve
job
explosion
instead
they
get
an
ego
massage
he
told
them
how
great
they
be
and
how
all
of
apple
be
counting
on
them
he
say
that
they
could
make
it
happen
that
they
could
get
the
software
finish
it
be
simply
impossible
to
send
out
demo
disk
it
would
send
the
wrong
message
to
the
marketplace
he
be
counting
on
them
and
they
could
do
it
and
with
that
he
hung
up
before
they
have
a
chance
to
argue
the
people
in
the
conference
room
in
cupertino
be
stun
they
have
push
so
hard
already
that
they
be
near
the
point
of
total
exhaustion

a
time
in

climb
when
strong

chosen
his
people
well
they
would
not

him
down
there

considerable
pride
that

as
any
he
have
ever
give
his
presence
be
powerful
his
charisma
entice
his
intensity
captivate
the
only
thing
miss
be
a
sense
of
humor
in
the
day
that
follow
customer
flock
to
shop
to
see
for
themselves
what
all
the

the
critical
first
hundred

rack
up
the
seventy
thousand

the
young
wild
steve
and
the
straitlaced
texas
patriot
could
not
have
be
more
different
they

along
like

at
a
cookout
still
in

end
perot

fit
between

well
when
they
arrive
the
epson

be
gracious
even
though
they
have
be
stand
by
at
the
ready
for
hour
steve
be
in
a
foul
mood
the
epson
president
stood
up
to
make
the
product
presentation
himself
the
gentleman
have
hardly
start
have
spoken
for
little
more
than
a
minute
before
steve
interrupt
accord
to
jay
elliott
who
be
part
of
the
team
and
witness
the
incident
steve
turn
to
the
president
of
the
company
and
say
this
be
s
t
do
not
you
have
anything
good
and
with
that
he
march
out
later
on
the
train
head
back
to
tokyo
steve
begin
to
vent
rather
than
use
the
opportunity
to
explore
the
difficulty
within
apple
he
talk
about
the
problem
he
be
have
with
his
late
flame
the
designer
of
the
vietnam
veteran
memorial
yale
architecture
student
maya
lin
he
could
not
understand
why
thing
be
always
so
difficult
for
him
elliott
say
he
do
not
care
about
the
little
scene
at
epson
that
have
meant
nothing
to
him
he
have
forgotten
it
as
soon
as
it
be
over
what
really
count
be
love
and
he
could
not
understand
why
he
could
not
make
it
work
the
multimillionaire
founder
of
apple
computer
pour
out
his
heart
as
japan
speed
by
outside
his
train
window
he
be
near
his
thirtieth
birthday
and
still
long
to
start
a
family
but
be
afraid
of
what
the
future
held
finally
he
turn
to
elliott
and
blurt
out
a
complaint
that
might
have
make
sense
if
spoken
by
a
rembrandt
or
a
beethoven
i
be
just
an
ordinary
guy
why
ca
not
they
understand
that
the
maelstrom
continued
to
swirl
sale
dipped
below
ten
thousand
a
month
steve
be
have
enormous
mood
swing
and
sculley
have
not
take
charge
people
be
not
buying
macintosh
in
part
because
there
be
still
no
serious
software
available
by
now
the
initial
apple
iic
rush
have
die
out
bad
del
yocam
have
put
in
a
production
order
base
on
the
earlier
strong
sale
and
the
company
found
itself
stuck
with
a
huge
inventory
of
unsold
unit
apple
have
to
announce
a
write
off
of
the
unsold
inventory
which
give
wall
street
the
jitter
two
hundred
thousand
of
the
machine
have
to
be
liquidate
through
a
bartering
company
apple
be
stall
and
sinking
even
so
the
macintosh
division
be
on
a
takeover
binge
grab
control
of
the
internal
group
responsible
for
companywide
function
like
advertising
public
relation
distribution
and
peripheral
steve
rationale
be
that
it
be
the
only
way
that
he
as
chairman
of
the
board
could
be
sure
that
the
right
thing
would
be
do
but
it
be
the
inordinate
amount
of
power
center
in
the
macintosh
division
that
be
at
the
root
of
the
company
problem
the
situation
be
all
the
bad
because
it
be
steve
who
wield
that
power
a
week
after
the
annual
meeting
in
phoenix
arizona
most
of
apple
executive
staff
head
for
another
retreat
one
morning
the
company
marketing
bos
mike
murray
found
sculley
and
pr
maven
regis
mckenna
attend
a
session
he
told
them
that
it
be
essential
he
have
a
private
meeting
with
them
and
the
urgency
of
his
tone
convince
the
two
to
hear
him
out
on
their
way
to
the
elevator
steve
saw
the
three
of
them
together
and
ask
what
they
be
up
to
murray
trap
say
they
be
go
to
have
a
meeting
steve
indicate
that
he
want
to
join
them
for
the
first
time
in
his
three
year
at
apple
mike
murray
say
no
to
steve
job
steve
be
insistent
but
murray
stood
his
ground
eventually
they
left
the
chairman
stand
there
as
the
elevator
door
close
and
head
upstairs
it
be
steve
first
inkling
that
something
might
be
up
and
he
decide
he
would
find
out
what
it
be
meanwhile
the
three
conspirator
be
hole
up
in
sculley
hotel
room
with
murray
tell
the
company
president
that
he
thought
steve
have
to
be
remove
from
his
position
as
head
of
the
macintosh
division
sculley
and
mckenna
listen
carefully
while
murray
a
trust
lieutenant
an
insider
and
a
loyal
subject
to
prince
steve
ticked
off
the
reason
behind
his
conclusion
finally
the
lightbulb
start
to
flicker
in
sculley
head
if
murray
who
be
closer
to
steve
than
almost
anyone
else
be
tell
him
that
steve
have
to
be
remove
from
the
head
of
the
macintosh
division
then
surely
something
be
seriously
wrong
under
steve
recent
power
grab
the
macintosh
group
that
have
start
as
a
tight
knit
clan
of
pirate
commit
to
the
cause
have
now
swollen
to
a
mondo
division
of
seven
hundred
people
with
barely
a
trickle
of
revenue
to
pay
their
salary
and
driven
by
a
leader
who
make
decision
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
and
change
them
just
as
quickly
it
would
have
be
easy
to
lay
blame
for
these
problem
at
least
in
part
on
murray
himself
and
perhaps
in
some
way
it
be
right
to
do
so
because
as
director
of
marketing
he
certainly
have
a
large
hand
in
the
decision
that
have
lead
to
the
current
mess
after
all
the
fundamental
trouble
be
that
they
have
miss
the
market
they
thought
they
could
sell
machine
into
the
office
environment
and
they
do
not
know
or
do
not
bother
to
find
out
that
those
computer
be
normally
purchase
in
group
apple
have
always
sell
to
individual
tailor
all
of
its
marketing
to
make
a
person
feel
good
about
choose
to
go
with
apple
steve
have
convince
them
all
that
their
plan
be
on
the
money
and
he
have
sculley
completely
bamboozle
as
well
they
have
all
be
sure
that
the
strategy
be
correct
and
that
the
drop
sale
be
simply
a
reflection
of
the
computer
shakeout
the
seasonal
softness
or
the
nonexistent
software
he
could
see
the
horizon
out
there
a
thousand
mile
out
explain
jay
elliott
but
he
could
never
see
the
detail
of
each
little
mile
that
have
to
be
cover
to
get
there
that
be
his
genius
and
his
downfall
after
phoenix
steve
and
his
original
cofounder
woz
travel
to
washington
for
a
ceremony
at
which
president
ronald
reagan
pre
sented
them
with
the
first
national
technology
medal
for
their
contribution
to
american
technological
advance
it
be
an
uncomfortable
moment
for
both
steves
however
they
could
not
stand
each
other
anymore
and
could
scarcely
contain
their
dislike
when
job
return
to
california
he
found
that
wozniak
have
publicly
quit
apple
in
a
blast
of
uncensored
comment
woz
berate
the
company
for
its
lack
of
support
for
the
apple
ii
product
line
and
its
chaotic
management
clearly
relish
the
dig
at
his
former
friend
woz
ripped
the
way
that
the
company
have
ignore
the
apple

at
the
recent
annual
meeting

though
it

and
the
word

once
i
make
a
very
strong
complaint
about
it

decide
that

only
person

john
both
spoke
of
resign
that
day
john
to

change
steve
finally
listen
to
his
friend
and
they
then
spent
several
hour
review
his
option
they
decide
that
instead
of
act
hastily
it
would
be
well
to
give
thing
a
few
day
to
calm
down
it
be
the
memorial
day
weekend
anyway
why
not

to
sculley
steve
drove
over
to

the
next
morning

advice
he
sought
to
convince
john
that
he

only
try
to
do
the
right
thing
for
apple
and
that
it
be
not
meant
to
reflect
on
sculley
himself
steve
be
at
his
most
charm
remarkably
compose
and
not
at
all
strident
or
aggressive
the
two
men
walk
along
the
wind
lane
surround
sculley
house
as
steve
try
to
explain
himself
he
really
do
want
only
what
be
best
for
apple
he
insist
and
if
that
meant
he
have
to
leave
the
company
then
so
be
it
he
would
abide
by
whatever
decision
sculley
ultimately
make
but
he
want
one
more
chance
to
stay
with
the
company
that
he
have
found
the
nonconfrontational
sculley
be
persuade

good
i
may
have

a
mistake
it

a
good
concept
but
it
go
a
little
too
far
steve
job
be
down
but
not
out
he
continued
talk
about
his
team
but
it
could
have
be
a
description
of
himself
a
lot
of
it
go
to
their
head
for
a
few
people
it
be
very
difficult
when
thing
happen
you
have
to
think
very
strongly
about
your
inner
value
what
really
be
important
for
you
when
thing
happen
very
fast
you
do
not
have
the
time
it
can
scramble
your
brain
by
july
steve
be
in
russia
but
he
felt
ready
to
return
to
cupertino
he
want
to
patch
up
his
difference
with
sculley
and
get
on
with
his
new
job
whatever
that
be
when
he
arrive
back
at
apple
in
the
middle
of
july
however
he
found
that
the
corporation
do
not
want
him
i
be
ask
to
move
out
of
my
office
he
explain
they
lease
a
little
building
across
the
street
from
most
of
the
other
apple
building
i
nickname
it
siberia
so
i
move
across
the
street
and
i
make
sure
that
all
of
the
executive
staff
have
my
home
phone
number
i
knew
that
john
have
it
and
i
call
the
rest
of
them
personally
and
make
sure
they
have
it
and
told
them
i
want
to
be
useful
in
any
way
i
could
and
to
please
call
me
if
i
could
help
on
anything
they
all
have
a
cordial
phrase
but
none
of
them
ever
call
so
i
use
to
go
to
work
i
would
get
there
and
i
would
have
one
or
two
phone
call
to
perform
a
little
bit
of
mail
to
look
at
but
most
of
the
corporate
management
report
stop
flow
by
my
desk
a
few
people
might
see
my
car
in
the
parking
lot
and
come
over
and
commiserate
and
i
would
get
depressed
and
go
home
in
two
or
three
or
four
hour
really
depressed
i
do
that
a
few
time
and
i
decide
that
it
be
mentally
unhealthy
so
i
just
stop
go
in
you
know
there
be
nobody
really
there
to
miss
me

nonetheless
ever
the
sloganeer

stomach
steve
explain
try
to
describe
how
he
felt
it
knock
the
wind
out
of
you
and
you
ca
not
breathe
if
you
relax
you
can
start
breathing
again
that
be
how
i
felt
the
thing
i
have
to
do
be
try
to
relax
it
be
hard
but
i
go
for
a
lot
of
long
walk
in
the
wood
and
do
not
really
talk
to
a
lot
of
people
a
few
day
later
he
decide
to
sell
a
little
more
than
percent
of
his
apple
share
which
be
the
maximum
quarterly
sale
allow
under
sec
regulation
the
sale
net
him
around
million
and
squelch
rumor
of
a
leveraged
buy
out
that
have
be
circulate
since
he
have
make
a
call
to
morgan
stanley
in
late
may
he
just
want
to
get
out
and
the
rule
of
sell
founder
share
be
such
that
he
have
to
sell
off
his
stake
piecemeal
he
still
have
six
million
share
which
be
worth
about
million
even
at
the
depressed
price
nonetheless
the
sale
start
a
flurry
of
rumor
about
his
plan
few
people
expect
the
thirty
year
old
to
quietly
accept
be
sent
out
to
pasture
speculation
center
on
steve
either
start
an
investment
fund
launch
a
new
career
as
a
venture
capitalist
or
start
some
sort
of
new
company
he
be
know
to
have
be
pursue
the
computer
graphic
division
of
george
lucas
empire
in
the
month
before
the
final
reorganization
he
now
have
the
beginning
of
a
war
chest
but
what
would
he
use
it
for
the
answer
be
not
long
in
come
with
time
on
his
hand
he
hire
a
political
consult
firm
to
help
him
find
a
way
into
politics
it
be
the
same
group
that
have
work
with
his
sometimes
role
model
and
fellow
zen
buddhist
disciple
former
california
governor
jerry
brown
but
steve
have
never
vote
or
belong
to
a
political
party
the
group
apparently
told
him
that
gain
a
constituency
would
be
difficult
he
start
to
look
in
other
direction
i
think
what
i
be
best
at
be
create
new
innovative
product
that
be
what
i
enjoy
do
he
say
later
that
summer
finally
start
to
understand
what
those
around
him
have
be
say
for
year
i
enjoy
and
i
be
best
work
with
a
small
team
of
talented
people
that
be
what
i
do
with
the
apple
ii
and
that
be
what
i
do
with
the
macintosh
i
have
a
piece
of
paper
one
day
and
i
be
write
down
the
thing
that
i
care
the
most
about
that
i
be
most
proud
of
personally
in
my
ten
year
at
apple
there
be
obviously
the
creation
of
the
apple
ii
and
the
macintosh
but
other
than
that
the
thing
that
i
really
care
about
be
help
to
set
up
the
apple
education
foundation
i
come
up
with
this
crazy
idea
that
turn
into
a
program
call
the
kid
ca
not
wait
in
which
we
try
to
give
a
computer
to
every
school
in
america
and
end
up
give
one
to
every
school
in
california
about
ten
thousand
computer
i
put
those
two
together
work
with
small
team
of
talented
people
to
create
breakthrough
product
and
education
that
summer
steve
spent
a
lot
of
time
wander
around
the
semideserted
stanford
university
campus
and
the
roll
hill
that
frame
it
search
for
an
answer
to
the
question
that
continued
to
haunt
him
he
have
always
felt
at
home
there
start
as
a
high

hang
out
in
the

then
audit

campus
steve
and
sculley

even

there
during
happier
time
stanford
meant
something
special
to
the
college
dropout
and
high
tech
preacher
he
go
into
the
library
and
begin
to
delve
into
the
world
of
biochemistry
and
recombinant
dna
research
try
to
understand
the
bay
area
other
rapidly
grow
industry
he
have
met
paul
berg
one
of
stanford
nobel
prize
win
biochemist
at
a
dinner
for
france
president
francois
mitterrand
a
year
earlier
he
call
him
up
and
invite
him
to
lunch
to
ask
a
few
question
over
a
meal
in
a
coffee
shop
near
the
stanford
campus
he
and
berg
talk
he
be
show
me
how
they
be
do
gene
repair
steve
say
actually
it
be
straightforward
it
be
kind
of
neat
it
smell
a
lot
like
some
of
the
concept
you
find
in
computer
science
he
be
explain
how
he
do
experiment
in
a
wet
laboratory
and
they
take
a
week
or
two
to
run
i
ask
him
why
do
not
you
simulate
them
on
a
computer
not
only
will
it
allow
you
to
run
your
experiment
faster
but
someday
every
freshman
microbiology
student
in
the
country
can
play
with
paul
berg
recombinant
software
his
eye
lit
up
berg
for
his
part
remembers
the
conversation
a
little
differently
it
be
steve
whose
eye
lit
up
the
scientist
explain
to
the
young
entrepreneur
that
the
computer
use
to
run
such
simulation
be
presently
too
expensive
and
the
software
primitive
suddenly
he
be
excite
by
the
possibility
recall
berg
he
have
it
in
mind
to
start
a
new
company
he
be
young
and
rich
and
have
to
find
something
to
do
with
the
rest
of
his
life
this
sound
like
it
it
have
be
a
long
time
since
steve
felt
the
surge
of
energy
that
he
have
experienced
with
the
blue
box
the
apple
i
and
ii
the
early
lisa
and
the
macintosh
with
possibility
of
something
on
the
horizon
the
inspiration
start
to
come
through
again
it
be
a
new
product
a
new
machine
a
fresh
love
affair
a
new
trail
to
blaze
just
as
steve
be
get
turn
on
by
this
idea
of
create
a
new
computer
for
the
university
market
in
late
august
something
happen
at
apple
that
crystallize
what
would
be
the
formation
of
his
next
project
gassee
cancel
the
fledgling
big
mac
computer
in
favor
of
a
much
less
ambitious
little
big
mac
when
he
take
over
the
macintosh
division
that
summer
gassee
expand
the
development
program
for
an
advanced
interim
version
of
the
mac
base
loosely
on
a
computer
that
have
be
abandon
and
be
center
in
that
engineering
group
code
name
little
big
mac
it
kept
the
basic
design
of
the
macintosh
and
simply
substitute
a
more
powerful
chip
the
this
contrast
sharply
with
the
big
mac
which
be
an
extremely
powerful
machine
built
around
a
custom
chip
set
code
name
the
jonathon
and
create
by
rich
page
one
of
the
key
designer
of
the
lisa
when
gassee
cancel
the
big
mac
page
be
miffed
he
talk
about
leave
apple
with
his
close
friend
bud
tribble
the
original
macintosh
software
project
leader
who
have
return
after
medical
school
and
be
again
in
charge
of
software
development
for
the
macintosh
tribble
be
one
of
the
first
people
steve
thought
of
as
he
formulate
his
new
venture
over
the
labor
day
weekend
at
the
begin
of
september
steve
broach
the
subject
of
a
new
company
to
the
soft
spoken
manager
and
be
encourage
that
tribble
found
his
idea
intrigue
they
discuss
the
m
machine
that
university
be
settle
on
as
the
computer
of
the
future
advanced
workstation
with
one
million
pixel
of
resolution
on
screen
one
million
byte
of
main
memory
and
the
ability
to
process
up
to
one
million
instruction
per
second
hence
three
m
s
these
would
be
the
basis
for
the
workstation
of
the
future
and
although
machine
of
this
caliber
be
available
from
workstation
company
and
ibm
they
presently
cost
well
over
apiece
much
more
than
the
target
that
university
be
willing
to
pay
tribble
knew
just
who
could
build
such
a
machine
he
suggest
a
couple
of
people
at
apple
who
might
be
willing
to
help
get
it
off
the
ground
include
page
and
george
crow
an
analog
engineer
who
have
be
a
member
of
the
original
macintosh
team
steve
also
suggest
susan
barnes
the
macintosh
controller
for
the
financial
side
of
thing
and
dan
l
lewin
architect
of
the
successful
apple
university
consortium
who
have
be
promote
to
marketing
manager
for
all
highereducation
application
during
the
recent
reorganization
when
steve
ask
each
of
them
sub
rosa
they
all
agree
to
join
him
he
be
at
his
most
inspire
and
persuasive
as
he
wove
the
dream
of
his
new
enterprise
he
be
talk
to
a
group
of
people
who
have
never
be
at
the
heart
of
the
macintosh
project
essential
yes
but
not
the
key
superstar
they
be
all
individualist
who
like
steve
be
search
for
another
chance
to
create
something
great
this
time
with
their
name
indelibly
link
to
its
creation
and
apple
no
longer
seem
like
the
place
to
do
it
as
tribble
say
everyone
want
to
be
involve
in
a
start
up
this
would
be
a
start
up
with
a
bang
that
would
return
them
to
the
root
of
apple
the
way
steve
described
it
how
could
it
fail
overnight
he
have
the
kernel
of
a
company
we
have
no
business
plan
we
have
not
do
anything
steve
say
a
few
day
later
when
their
plan
go
public
now
you
might
say
we
be
all
crazy
but
we
have
all
know
each
other
for
four
year
and
we
have
an
immense
amount
of
confidence
in
each
other
ability
and
genuinely
like
each
other
we
all
have
a
desire
to
have
a
small
company
where
we
can
influence
its
destiny
and
have
a
really
fun
place
to
work
with
that
steve
realize
that
he
have
well
tell
apple
about
the
new
venture
a
board
meeting
be
schedule
for
september
and
though
he
have
not
attend
them
for
the
last
several
month
as
chairman
he
be
still
entitle
as
the
meeting
be
call
to
order
he
briefly
explain
that
he
have
do
a
lot
of
think
about
thing
over
the
summer
and
have
come
to
a
few
conclusion
although
no
one
record
the
speech
when
steve
described
his
motivation
to
newsweek
a
few
day
later
it
sound
like
a
speech
he
might
have
give
before
i
personally
man
want
to
build
thing
i
be
i
be
not
ready
to
be
an
industry
pundit
i
get
three
offer
to
be
a
professor
during
the
summer
and
i
told
all
of
the
university
that
i
thought
i
would
be
an
awful
professor
what
i
be
best
at
do
be
find
a
group
of
talented
people
and
make
thing
with
them
i
respect
the
direction
that
apple
be
go
in
but
for
me
personally
you
know
i
want
to
make
thing
and
if
there
be
no
place
for
me
to
make
thing
there
then
i
will
do
what
i
do
twice
before
i
will
make
my
own
place
you
know
i
do
it
in
the
garage
when
apple
start
and
i
do
it
in
the
metaphorical
garage
when
the
mac
start
i
help
shepherd
apple
from
a
garage
to
a
billion
and
a
halfdollar
company
it
take
a
bunch
of
rambunctious
upstart
work
with
very
little
resource
but
a
certain
vision
and
commitment
to
do
it
i
be
probably
not
the
best
person
in
the
world
to
shepherd
it
to
a
five
or
ten
billion
dollar
company
which
i
think
be
probably
its

sort
of
odd
chip
on
my
shoulder
about
prove
anything
to

ten
of

much
of
anything
i

my
life
phil

he
have
see
the
charismatic
young
man
sway
some
mighty
skeptical
board
member
before
if
the
board
be
inclined
to
tear
there
would
not
have
be
a
dry
eye
in
the
place
steve
be
give

no
intention
of

any
technology
or
proprietary
idea
out
of

mention
that
he
would
be
take
a
few
people
from
the
company
but
by
no
mean
enough
to
disrupt
operation
or
the
product
they
be
work
on
and
anyway
they
would
be
people
who
be
already
leave
he
offer
his
resignation
as
chairman
if
the
board
thought
that

would
compete
with

that
seem
perfectly

chapter
in

s

history
dear
mike
this
morning
paper
carry
suggestion
that
apple
be
consider
remove
me
as
chairman
i
do
not
know
the
source
of
these
report
but
they
be
both
mislead
to
the
public
and
unfair
to
me
you
will
recall
that
at
last
thursday
board
meeting
i
state
i
have
decide
to
start
a
new
venture
and
i
tender
my
resignation
as
chairman
the
board
decline
to
accept
my
resignation
and
ask
me
to
defer
it
for
a
week
i
agree
to
do
so
in
light
of
the
encouragement
the
board
offer
with
regard
to
the
propose
new
venture
and
the
indication
that
apple
would
invest
in
it
on
friday
after
i
told
john
sculley
who
would
be
join
me
he
confirm
apple
willingness
to
discus
area
of
possible
collaboration
between
apple
and
my
new
venture
subsequently
the
company
appear
to
be
adopt
a
hostile
posture
toward
me
and
the
new
venture
accordingly
i
must
insist
upon
the
immediate
acceptance
of
my
resignation
i
would
hope
that
in
any
statement
it
feel
it
must
issue
the
company
will
make
it
clear
that
the
decision
to
resign
as
chairman
be
mine
i
find
myself
both
sadden
and
perplexed
by
the
management
conduct
in
this
matter
which
seem
to
me
contrary
to
apple
best
interest
those
interest
remain
a
matter
of
deep
concern
to
me
both
because
of
my
past
association
with
apple
and
the
substantial
investment
i
retain
in
it
i
continue
to
hope
that
calmer
voice
within
the
company
may
yet
be
heard
some
company
representative
have
say
they
fear
i
will
use
proprietary
apple
technology
in
my
new
venture
there
be
no
basis
for
any
such
concern
if
that
concern
be
the
real
source
of
apple
hostility
to
the
venture
i
can
allay
it
as
you
know
the
company
recent
re
organization
left
me
with
no
work
to
do
and
no
access
even
to
regular
management
report
i
be
but
and
want
still
to
contribute
and
achieve
after
what
we
have
accomplish
together
i
would
wish
our
part
to
be
both
amicable
and
dignify
yours
sincerely
steven
p
job
then
in
front
of
the
press
gather
at
his
house
steve
burn
all
the
bridge
the
love
affair
be
over
he
face
the
future
with
a
kind
of
tough
and
brutal
honesty
that
be
immensely
compelling
he
described
the
end
in
romantic
almost
melodramatic
term
that
paint
him
as
the
aggrieve
party
my
heart
will
always
be
there
he
say
refer
to
apple
my
relationship
with
the
company
be
like
a
first
love
i
will
always
remember
apple
in
the
same
way
any
man
remembers
the
first
woman
he
be
fall
in
love
with
to
me
apple
exists
in
the
spirit
of
the
people
who
work
there
and
the
philosophy
and
purpose
by
which
they
go
about
their
business
if
apple
becomes
a
place
where
computer
be
a
commodity
item
where
the
romance
be
go
and
where
people
forget
that
computer
be
the
most
incredible
invention
that
man
have
ever
invent
i
will
feel
i
have
lose
apple
but
if
i
be
a
million
mile
away
and
all
those
people
still
feel
those
thing
and
they
be
still
work
to
make
the
next
great
personal
computer
then
i
will
feel
that
my
gene
be
still
there
a
few
day
later
steve
announce
that
he
have
settle
on
a
name
for
the
new
venture
he
name
it
next
and
set
about
do
the
paperwork
to
incorporate
it
all
week
long
apple
and
steve
attorney
try
to
come
to
some
agreement
to
allow
them
all
to
part
on
if
not
amicable
at
least
amenable
term
while
steve
be
willing
to
agree
to
a
hire

machine
at

it
look
like
the

the
bridge
be
burn
steve

incense
by
the
accusation
and
go
back
to

where
once
again
he

treat
royally
when
somebody
call
you
a
thief
in
public
you
have
to
respond
i
be
very
surprised
that
apple
be
sue
me
we
have
spent
an
entire
week
talk
with
apple
lawyer
show
them
that
we
have
no

in

we
do
not
want
to
get
involve
with
an
unjustified

we
just
want
to
build
our
company
and
invent
something
new
he
go
on
to
argue
that
apple

appear
to
assert
that
steve

not
be
able
to
practice
my
craft
ever
again
in
my
life
that
he
insist
reasonably
seem
odd
he
end
with
a
delightful
capper
it
be
hard
to
think
that
a
billion
company
with
plus
people
could
not
compete
with
six
people
in
blue
jean
the

ate
it
up
with
that
as
steve

to
visit
university
try
to
find
out
what
they
should
build
into
their
new
machine
the
lawsuit
degenerate
into
legal
squabble
and
one
upmanship
over
deposition
schedule
and
finally
in
the
wake
of
a
record

post
for
the

elegantly
curve
free
stand
staircase
in
the
heart
of
it
that
they
be
walk
on
a
million
dollar
piece
of
architectural
majesty
craft
by
i
m
pei
in
an
otherwise
indistinctive
silicon
valley
cookie
cutter
building
from
the
mid
s
on
this
be
the
corporate
headquarters
of
the
company
that
steve
create
to
show
apple
and
the
world
the
genius
that
he
knew
he
be
at
that
time
ensure
aesthetic
perfection
in
everything
he
do
be
more
important
than
substance
hence
the
million
dollar
staircase
steve
do
not
want
to
break
up
the
space
with
support
beam
it
be
an
apt
metaphor
not
only
for
the
organize
principle
of
the
company
but
for
everything
that
be
wrong
with
steve
at
the
time
next
spent
thousand
of
dollar
with
paul
rand
a
famous
graphic
designer
for
a
logo
a
multicolored
cube
that
resemble
a
child
building
block
with
an
odd
font
treatment
next
the
irony
be
that
the
original
next
machine
be
black
and
white
only
because
of
the
complexity
of
the
graphic
they
be
design
to
display
the
machine
be
also
house
in
a
sleek
cubelike
box
another
vast
design
effort
driven
by
steve
to
his
tune
of
cool
the
money
spent
on
design
do
not
do
any
good
however
because
the
computer
be
delayed
and
even
university
balk
at
buying
specialized
computer
when
cheaper
alternative
be
available
from
a
company
like
sun
microsystems
the
early
year
of
next
be
fill
with
glow
pronouncement
from
the
young
prince
of
technology
another
much
promote
issue
be
the
next
factory
a
state
of
the
art
robot
driven
factory
that
steve
built
it
get
an
enormous
amount
of
attention
hundred
of
next
computer
could
be
built
every
day
with
hardly
any
human
intervention
it
be
a
model
of
just
in
time
manufacturing
design
to
reduce
cost
by
force
supplier
to
deliver
component
within
hour
of
be
need
it
be
never
use
however
because
the
demand
never
materialize
as
steve
discover
during
the
macintosh
era
deliver
real
product
be
much
harder
than
talk
about
them
in
the
s
steve
head
have
be
turn
by
the
sophisticated
worldly
woman
of
new
york
on
one
occasion
a
friend
have
set
steve
up
to
have
drink
with
a
woman
name
diane
steve
call
to
arrange
the
date
and
be
struck
by
how
much
the
woman
seem
to
talk
like
a
character
in
a
woody
allen
movie
as
they
be
about
to
hang
up
steve
ask
by
the
way
what
your
last
name
she
answer
keaton
then
he
met
a
california
graphic
designer
strike
enough
to
be
mistaken
for
a
movie
star
except
for
her
considerable
intelligence
and
her
beauty
christina
redse
tina
be
not
a
woman
whom
steve
friend
would
have
expect
him
to
be
drawn
to
true
they
tend
to
dress
alike
in
jean
and
a
black
t
shirt
or
turtleneck
in
some
way
they
be
both
earthy
steve
with
his
zen
and
his
trip
to
india
tina
with
her
underplayed
beauty
that
make
her
even
more
stun
when
she
go
as
she
most
often
do
without
makeup
there
be
a
sexual
chemistry
between
them
that
be
obvious
sometimes
a
little
too
obvious
to
steve
friend
the
surprising
part
have
to
do
with
the
way
they
related
to
each
other
usually
steve
seem
to
be
comfortable
around
people
who
would
not
challenge
his
authority
it
be
okay
to
challenge
his
idea
as
long
as
you
could
make
a
good
case
for
your
point
of
view
you
could
even
argue
with
him
but
when
the
dust
settle
it
would
be
his
decision
with
woman
too
steve
want
to
be
in
charge
tina
be
strong
will
she
be
not
go
to
be
pliant
yield
or
humble
just
so
she
could
be
see
on
the
arm
of
steve
job
she
move
in
with
him
for
a
while
decide
she
do
not
like
it
and
move
out
again
but
he
kept
see
her
tina
redse
it
seem
have
found
a
place
in
steve
heart
in
steve
attend
a
birthday
party
in
georgetown
for
katharine
graham
the
woman
who
have
transform
the
washington
post
into
a
newspaper
of
national
stature
and
guide
it
through
the
crisis
of
the
pentagon
paper
and
the
debacle
of
watergate
that
have
end
in
force
richard
nixon
out
of
the
white
house
apparently
because
of
his
connection
with
ross
perot
steve
have
be
invite
to
this
washington
social
event
of
the
year
it
be
accepted
in
washington
that
politico
get
business
do
over
drink
steve
need
no
encouragement
to
play
that
game
and
he
make
two
conquest
before
the
end
of
the
even
he
harangue
king
juan
carlos
of
spain
afterward
claim
that
he
would
talk
the
gentleman
into
buying
a
computer
he
have
bully
a
king
into
a
sale
it
be
like
meeting
michael
eisner
at
a
party
and
sell
him
your
screenplay
or
run
into
britney
spear
at
a
restaurant
and
convincing
her
to
record
your
song
steve
also
met
someone
who
for
him
be
the
incarnation
of
the
archenemy
not
bill
gate
but
almost
as
bad
john
akers
the
ceo
of
ibm
it
be
not
as
if
they
be
face
each
other
over
a
conference
table
steve
show
his
gracious
human
side
and
drop
hint
about
a
nextgeneration
operating
system
that
would
surprise
the
industry
the
hint
he
drop
percolate
through
ibm
and
one
day
steve
administrative
assistant
buzz
him
to
say
that
an
executive
from
ibm
be
on
the
phone
the
company
be
interested
in
opening
discussion
about
the
operating
system
mr
job
have
mention
to
mr
akers
steve
be
not
easily
intimidate
still
he
have
never
have
much
taste
for
deal
with
company
large
and
more
powerful
than
his
own
ibm
have
always
be
a
prominent
member
of
that
more
powerful
group
but
he
agree
to
negotiation
quite
possibly
he
be
think
along
the
same
line
that
howard
hughes
have
be
year
earlier
hughes
have
be
approach
by
a
consortium
interested
in
purchasing
the
cornerstone
of
his
empire
the
hughes
tool
company
he
agree
to
entertain
the
proposal
the
prospective
buyer
spent
month
on
due
diligence
examine
the
book
pore
over
the
asset
evaluate
the
future
prospect
and
interview
the
executive
finally
they
return
to
hughes
with
an
elaborate
proposal
he
thanked
them
warmly
and
say
he
would
let
them
know
that
be
the
last
they
ever
heard
of
the
matter
and
they
finally
realize
they
have
be
played
for
fool
hughes
have
just
be
interested
in
somebody
else
closely
scrutinize
every
aspect
of
the
company
the
asset
the
financials
the
process
the
quality
of
the
executive
and
tell
him
what
they
thought
the
whole
business
be
worth
maybe
steve
have
something
equally
mischievous
in
mind
whatever
his
true
motif
ibm
examination
of
the
operating
system
software
which
steve
be
now
call
nextstep
convince
them
that
this
be
indeed
powerful
enough
to
enhance
the
ibm
product
one
day
an
ibm
executive
show
up
at
steve
office
for
a
meeting
the
world
preeminent
computer
company
be
prepared
to
make
a
deal
for
the
right
to
use
nextstep
and
the
detail
be
spell
out
in
the
one
hundred
plus
page
contract
that
the
ibm
executive
shove
across
the
table
steve
picked
it
up
and
drop
it
in
the
trash
can
if
ibm
want
to
deal
with
him
he
told
the
man
they
would
have
to
come
up
with
the
kind
of
contract
that
steve
like
simple
and
short
something
like
five
or
six
page
ibm
go
through
some
internal
gyration
you
can
just
imagine
the
company
representative
get
back
in
touch
and
suggest
that
steve
draw
up
a
contract
of
his
own
like
he
do
and
that
get
the
deal
back
on
track
this
be
still
early
enough
in
the
history
of
next
that
steve
could
think
he
would
have
the
world
beating
a
path
to
his
door
even
so
he
have
to
recognize
that
a
deal
with
ibm
would
bring
credibility
like
nothing
else
it
would
crown
him
with
a
halo
of
approval
practically
a
guarantee
of
invincibility
even
rumor
that
the
two
company
be
talk
set
the
business
reporter
on
fire
beg
for
confirmation
of
what
be
go
on
the
negotiation
continued
by
with
next
bruise
and
bleeding
from
lack
of
sale
for
the
cube
steve
own
executive
be
argue
that
the
company
should
get
out
of
the
hardware
business
and
concentrate
on
make
a
run
for
it
with
the
software
then
seemingly
just
in
time
ibm
sign
the
deal
with
steve
under
term
that
would
pump
in
the
million
that
would
rescue
next
from
sinking
the
story
do
not
have
a
happy
end
the
ibm
executive
who
have
be
the
visionary
drive
the
marriage
bill
lowe
the
man
who
have
brought
life
to
the
ibm
personal
computer
left
the
company
to
take
a
position
with
xerox
possibly
not
the
best
career
decision
he
could
have
make
for
next
the
loss
of
lowe
be
practically
a
death
knell
the
project
be
left
in
the
hand
of
people
who
do
not
see
the
potential
that
lowe
have
see
ibm
paid
the
up
front
amount
require
by
the
term
of
the
contract
then
stop
return
the
call
from
next
and
never
do
anything
with
nextstep
only
much
later
would
steve
recognize
the
opportunity
he
have
so
narrowly
miss
out
on
at
the
time
ibm
and
microsoft
be
in
the
midst
of
a
wrestling
match
over
compete
operating
system
microsoft
battling
to
establish
dominance
for
its
consumer
orient
window
and
ibm
throw
its
marketing
muscle
behind
its
more
sophisticated
program
o
both
have
be
create
by
microsoft
but
window
be
well
and
simpler
and
ibm
felt
that
it
have
be
played
for
a
fool
by
the
aggressive
guy
in
redmond
steve
have
the
chance
to
push
bill
gate
out
of
the
picture
and
simply
blew
it
if
he
have
be
easy
to
deal
with
from
the
begin
the
negotiate
could
have
move
much
faster
and
the
contract
could
have
be
sign
long
before
bill
lowe
depart
lowe
would
have
see
to
it
that
ibm
begin
shipping
pc
with
nextstep
instead
of
window
as
the
operating
system
steve
software
be
vastly
easy
to
learn
and
use
other
pc
manufacturer
would
quickly
have
fall
into
line
it
could
have
be
steve
instead
of
bill
gate
who
be
sit
back
and
virtually
without
effort
reap
a
license
fee
for
every
pc
sell
steve
and
his
team
of
new
pirate
have
quickly
see
that
create
a
computer
around
a
custom
chip
would
be
prohibitive
give
their
resource
and
manpower
limitation
instead
they
turn
once
again
to
motorola
settle
on
the
microprocessor
the
same
family
that
the
original
mac
have
use
but
a
new
generation
yet
motorola
after
promising
spectacular
semiconductor
achievement
and
a
ship
date
in
that
slip
to
and
finally
in
the
end
seriously
drop
the
ball
the
final
chip
have
nowhere
near
the
performance
require
to
power
the
type
of
visual
compute
software
the
next
be
promising
if
motorola
delay
in
deliver
a
chip
be
frustrate
at
least
steve
be
again
successful
in
perform
his
magic
with
the
exterior
design
the
next
computer
be
house
in
a
cube
a
strike
black
box
of
eye
catch
appearance
unfortunately
the
case
be
one
of
the
machine
few
admirable
feature
again
steve
have
hamstrung
the
machine
as
he
have
the
original
macintosh
with
a
series
of
decision
that
make
perfect
sense
to
him
but
curse
the
computer
next
have
problem
in
spade
the
design
do
not
call
for
a
floppy
disk
drive
but
instead
have
a
state
of
the
art
optical
magnetic
drive
that
allow
data
to
be
write
onto
special
compact
disk
it
be
the
kind
of
aggressive
forward
look
technology
decision
that
steve
love
to
make
but
it
turn
out
instead
to
be
a
technological
dead
end
magneto
optical
drive
never
caught
on
and
the
unit
instal
in
the
next
machine
be
fraught
with
problem
essentially
steve
have
manage
to
create
another
stylish
computer
that
be
more
about
flash
than
about
substance
and
that
aggressively
thumbed
its
nose
at
the
compute
convention
of
its
market
sector
without
the
deep
pocket
of
a
public
company
however
without
a
tradition
of
success
and

what
steve

about
put
the
ability
to
create

into
the
hand
of
every

owner
he
spun
a
web
of
imagery
and
present
a
vision
of
animation
as
the
domain
of
the
common
man
power
by
the
personal
computer

he

even
without
preparation
steve
dynamic
enthusiasm

built
in

could
win
the

but
not
the
audience
he
be

machine
he
announce
this
be
commerce
maybe
we
will
buy
a
thousand
of
these
an
order
of
a
thousand
unit
for
next
that
would
be
a
huge
sale
perhaps
even
enough
to
rescue
the
company
then
katzenberg
gesture
to
the
color
machine
this
be
art
he
announce
he
could
have
whisper
the
next
word
it
would
still
have
felt
like
a
bellow
i
own
animation
he
growl
and
nobody
go
to
get
it
then
he
capped
his
speech
with
language
that
sear
it
be
as
if
someone
come
to
date
my
daughter
i
have
a
shotgun
if
someone
try
to
take
animation
away
i
will
blow
his
ball
off
any
ordinary
person
would
have
be
entirely
thrown
by
an
eruption
like
that
cowed
distraught
decimate
and
probably
unable
to
continue
not
steve
job
he
be
familiar
enough
with
that
kind
of
passionate
intolerant
outburst
he
himself
frequently
explode
that
way
when
someone
make
a
bozo
remark
or
bad
when
someone
close
to
him
be
disloyal
steve
pause
for
only
a
moment
to
let
the
air
settle
then
he
go
right
back
to
his
sale
pitch
as
if
no
one
have
say
a
word
it
do
not
work
disney
remain
a
solidly
apple
macintosh
account
as
do
most
of
the
company
he
pitch
the
next
cube
sell
in
handful
to
some
university
computer
department
but
software
never
materialize
for
it
even
though
its
operating
system
be
tout
by
steve
as
have
something
call
object
orient
program
this
be
a
way
for
programmer
to
create
primitive
or
basic
building
block
of
software
then
string
them
together
to
quickly
generate
program
as
the
eighty
drew
to
a
close
the
next
machine
which
have
begin
in
such
optimism
seem
relegate
to
a
footnote
in

hardly
any

for
them
they
want
to
transcend
the

and
tap
into
human
emotion
the
nearly
unassailable
mountain
face
this
pioneer
crew
of
animator
have
to
do
with
the
question
of
light
sure
you
need
a
great
many
drawing
to
create
the
illusion
of
motion
but
to
accumulate
a
stack
of
flat
two
dimensional
drawing
like
those
for
sleep
beauty
involves
creative
animator
do
the
key
sketch
and
horde
of
people
do
the
in
betweens
the
individual
drawing
to
make
the
character
appear
to
move
from
the
position
in
one
key
sketch
to
the
next
this
be
the
traditional
hierarchy
of
animation
the
handful
of
animator
and
the
much
large
crew
of
inkers
and
painter
at
disney
mostly
underpaid
woman
who
be
kept
in
a
separate
building
and
give
about
as
much
praise
and
respect
as
the
janitorial
crew
now
animation
be
struggle
to
move
beyond
the
flatness
of
the
d
style
to
the
more
vivid
real
world
look
of
d
what
give
life
to
film
animation
what
give
it
a
sense
of
believability
that
the
audience
can
connect
with
have
to
do
with
the
way
light
bounce
off
every
surface
of
the
object
in
the
frame
when
we
look
at
a
rembrandt
or
a
vermeer
we
almost
feel
as
if
we
be
in
the
room
with
the
subject
in
the
history
of
painting
a
great
divide
be
cross
when
artist
come
to
understand
the
vital
role
of
light
reflection
and
shadow
and
then
discover
how
to
capture
on
canvas
what
the
eye
see
in
film
animation
try
to
capture
those
subtlety
of
light
on
every
object
in
the
frame
in
a
movie
that
might
have
or
separate
frame
would
spell
financial
suicide
that
be
where
ed
and
alvy
and
their
team
come
in
these
clever
ph
d
s
work
closely
with
artist
be
attempt
to
define
mathematical
equationsalgorithms
that
would
instruct
the
computer
to
calculate
exactly
the
right
light
bounce
automatically
if
the
light
in
the
scene
be
come
from
here
and
this
part
of
this
particular
object
have
just
this
curve
along
with
this
color
and
reflectivity
then
the
strength
the
direction
and
the
quality
of
the
bounce
light
should
be
that
of
course
all
of
that
be
purely
technical
mumbo
jumbo
the
real
magic
be
to
create
a
story
that
could
be
told
use
computer
animation
do
that
and
create
a
film
that
be
warm
funny
and
emotionally
satisfy
be
much
harder
than
all
the
computer
animation
work
when
their
benefactor
alex
schure
take
the
group
early
work
and
try
to
create
a
film
it
be
an
embarrassment
the
team
start
to
wonder
if
they
would
ever
find
a
filmmaker
who
knew
how
to
use
what
they
could
do
to
move
an
audience
at
the
same
time
filmmaker
george
lucas
be
awaken
to
a
recognition
of
his
own
in
star
war
one
of
the
most
memorable
visual
element
have
be
the
duel
with
the
light
saber
to
moviegoer
those
sequence
be
magical
to
filmmaker
lucas
they
be
a
nightmare
the
actor
have
to
mimic
a
battle
while
hold
nothing
but
the
metal
handle
then
in
postproduction
a
battalion
of
specialeffects
animator
have
to
paint
in
the
light
beam
painstakingly
frame
by
frame
an
exact
time
consume
excruciatingly
expensive
effort
then
there
be
the
problem
of
the
spaceship
hollywood
special
effect
people
have
developed
a
high
level
of
expertise
in
create
miniature
of
skyscraper
train
ship
and
spacecraft
and
make
them
look
entirely
believable
on
the
screen
lucas
though
have
scene
that
call
for
whole
fleet
of
spaceship
fly
across
the
screen
in
every
direction
achieve
that
require
take
the
same
piece
of
film
and
put
them
back
through
the
animation
camera
over
and
over
again
a
small
mistake
could
ruin
the
negative
require
that
the
entire
scene
be
restart
from
scratch
as
steve
job
later
point
out
if
you
go
buy
a
laser
disk
of
any
of
the
star
war
film
and
stop
it
on
some
of
the
frame
they
be
really
grungy
incredibly
noisy
very
bad
quality
george
lucas
be
the
perfectionist
he
be
say
i
would
like
to
do
it
perfectly
he
want
do
it
digitally
and
nobody
have
ever
do
that
before
surely
someone
must
have
a
solution
to
these
madden
problem
why
not
find
a
way
to
do
it
with
computer
the
year
on
long

be
extraordinarily
productive
building
on
the

their

be
something
of
an
afterthought
for
lucas
this
insider
say
he
do
not
think
d
computer
graphic
be
far
enough
along
yet
to
be
worth
put
a
lot
of
effort
into
but
his
newly
acquire

group
do
not
see
the
subject
in
that
light
its
member
live
and
breathe
the
same
rarefy
air
as
their
original
benefactor
alex

the
all
too
pure
oxygen
that
inspire
dream
of
an
animate
feature
film
create
entirely
on
the
computer
they
would
find
the
time
to
develop
the
software
to
make
those
dream
come
true
lucas
have
instal
the
group
in
a
building
he
own
in
the
charm
peaceful
little
town
where
he
live
san
anselmo
their
quarter
on
the
second
floor
above
a
laundromat
be
no
match
for
what
they
have
left
behind
but
they
would
not
have
complain
if
they
be
be
give
challenge
project
to
strain
their
talent
and
sharpen
their
skill
lucas
need
them
but
only
for
task
that
be
hardly
above
the
level
of
painting
beacon
of
light
onto
light
sword
handle
the
sky
brighten
when
lucas
won
an
assignment
from
paramount
to
do
some
scene
for
a
space
epic
star
trek
ii
the
wrath
of
khan
director
nicholas
meyer
have
specify
that
one
particular
scene
be
to
be
handle
with
computer
graphic
alvy
be
ecstatic
finally
at
long
last
he
would
be
develop
a
scene
for
a
major
big
time
hollywood
production
that
be
only
part
of
the
reason
for
his
glow
george
lucas
have
not
be
pay
much
attention
here
be
the
golden
opportunity
alvy
would
create
a
scene
so
dazzle
that
it
would
open
george
eye
to
the
wondrous
contribution
that
computer
graphic
could
make
to
his
movie
good
would
not
do
this
would
have
to
be
great
ed
catmull
rob
cook
and
loren
carpenter
have
be
quietly
at
work
on
a
program
to
create
d
graphic
they
conceive
a
system
that
would
be
tie
into
a
specialized
very
powerful
computer
and
would
be
able
to
create
animation
blazingly
fast
they
be
already
far
enough
along
with
the
software
to
use
it
on
alvy
star
trek
effort
which
have
come
to
be
know
as
the
genesis
scene
in
which
a
dead
planet
come
to
life
even
after
the
concept
have
be
approve
alvy
knew
he
still
need
a
capper
a
slam
dunk
that
would
drive
home
a
message
the
withdrawn
george
lucas
could
not
possibly
miss
he
found
it
he
design
one
elaborate
camera
movement
so
intricate
so
powerful
so
wickedly
clever
that
any
filmmaker
would
be
in
awe
because
it
be
a
shot
that
would
have
be
impossible
to
capture
in
real
life
the
camera
fly
above
the
flame
engulfed
planetary
surface
then
pan
to
look
back
at
the
fire
while
flee
just
fast
enough
to
avoid
be
swallow
by
the
rapidly
advance
wall
of
flame
when
the
scene
be
finish
alvy
could
not
have
be
more
pleased
but
would
it
convey
its
special
private
message
to
lucas
the
day
after
the
premiere
the
taciturn
lucas
step
into
alvy
workspace
announce
simply
great
camera
move
and
disappear
small
praise
but
that
do
not
matter
from
then
on
george
lucas
begin
call
on
alvy
ray
and
ed
to
spark
scene
in
his
movie
with
their
computer

wizardry
while

the

chore
lucas
hand
off
to
them
ed
alvy
and
their
team
continued
to
develop
new
software
tool
and
to

the
most
talented
animator
around
the
new
hire
and
others
be
already
at
work
create
d
still
image
sure
some
of
the
image
be
artful
vivid
and
breathtakingly
real
but
a
single
image
could
sometimes
take
month
to
complete
how
could
they
dare
to
dream
about
create
even
a
very
short
film
then
john
lasseter
fell
into
their
life
a
brilliant
disney

who
be
consider
a
rise
star
among
the

at
the
studio
john
be
one
of
those
rare
people
who
radiates
energy
and
enthusiasm
and
be
actually
likable
to
boot
on
top
of
that
he
be
an
animator
with
a
keen
sense
of
story
and
character
a
rare
and
prize
combination
of
ability
john
have
be
captivate
by
animation
at
an
early
age
when
the
disney
studio
inaugurate
a
character

curriculum
at
the
california
institute
of
the

by
the
time
he

john
have
garner
two
of
these

award
one
of
his

call
nitemare
the
other
use
a
theme
that
he
would
return
to
a
few
year
later
with
spectacular
result
he
call
it
lady
and
the
lamp
with
that
kind
of
success
it
be
not
much
of
a
surprise
that
disney
studio
hire
john
shortly
after
graduation
he
work
on
picture
such
as
the
feature
the
fox
and
the
hound
and
the
short
mickey
christmas
carol
in
between
those
two
project
he
do
some
work
on
the
feature
tron
where
he
receive
his
first
taste
of
computer
animation
he
like
the
flavor
as
it
happen
john
met
the
lucas
pair
just
at
a
time
when
his
frustration
at
disney
be
run
high
he
have
do
a
demo
clip
show
how
the
popular
child
book
where
the
wild
thing
be
by
maurice
sendak
could
be
brought
to
life
with
a
clever
composite
technique
that
use
hand
drawn
traditional
d
animation
for
the
character
in
front
of
vivid
colorful
d
background
create
by
computer
john
and
his
peer
thought
that
they
would
hit
the
bull
eye
with
this
effort
by
capture
a
new
sophisticated
look
while
keep
man
hour
and
cost
in
check
they
have
caught
the
original
spirit
of
the
classic
sendak
book
the
studio
honcho
however
even
with
a
proclaim
mandate
to
improve
quality
while
cut
cost
show
no
interest
in
the
project
the
idea
of
use
computer
for
anything
beyond
word
processing
and
accounting
be
simply
too
radical
ed
and
alvy
sense
john
unhappiness
at
disney
and
they
have
already
adopt
what
ed
later
described
as
a
philosophy
of
hire
people
who
be
well
than
we
be
in
they
entice
john
up
to
lucasfilm
to
work
with
their
computer
graphic
unit
for
a
month
he
do
not
need
much
convincing
to
realize
this
be
the
place
he
belong
since
they
be
not
suppose
to
have
any
artist
in
their
technology
part
of
the
lucas
operation
ed

alvy
give
john

they

with
george
but
as
thing
turn
out
nobody
complain
hire
john
prove
to
be
a
monumental
decision
bearing
on
the
life
of
john
himself
ed

alvy
and
steve

as
well
more
than
that
put
young
john

together
with

change
the
course
of
the
motion
picture
industry
for
all
his
success
as
a
filmmaker
george
lucas
be
less
successful
in
his
relationship
with
people
he
pours
emotion
into
his
film
and
can
grab
million
of
people
by
the
throat
yet
on
a
one
to
one
level
he
seem
withdrawn
barely
able
to
break
through
the
emotional
barrier
that
cut
him
off
from
the
rest
of
the
world
even
to
an
extent
from
those
closest
to
him
in
mid
may
george
and
his
wife
marcia
announce
that
they
be
filing
for
divorce
soon
after

whose
previous
boyfriend
have
be
the
counterculture
governor

it
be
hard
to
keep

kind
of
relationship
out
of
the
gossip
column
it
do
not
help
divorce
negotiation
either
because
california
be
a
joint
custody
state
the
split
meant
that
marcia
be
entitle
to
half
of

george

have
make
sense
when
it

alvy

only
an
occasional
project
that
brought
in
any
money
overall
they
have

unit
they
found
a
disney
executive
who
saw
how
this
could
make
sense
for
the
studio
and
present
a
deal
for
disney
to
buy
a
one
half
interest
from
lucas
for
million
when
the
executive
try
to
get
approval
for
the
deal
jeffrey
katzenberg
announce
that
he
have
more
press
issue
to
deal
with
and
this
would
be
a
waste
of
his
time
he
nixed
the
investment
that
path
be
dead
but
another
opportunity
open
up
in
industrialist
ross
perot
have
sell
his
company
ed
to
general
motor
and
become
a
member
of
the
gm
board
of
director
be
look
for
new
world
to
conquer
his
eye
light
on
george
lucas
computer
graphic
operation
perhaps
steve
have
also
be
too
enthusiastic
about
it
during
the
negotiation
over
next
over
a
period
of
month
perot
corral
philip
the
giant
dutch
electronics
firm
into
join
him
and
make
an
offer
with
a
bottom
line
figure
very
close
to
lucas
ask
price
of
million
after
a
deal
have
be
work
out
in
detail
by
both
side
on
the
very
day
that
perot
be
suppose
to
sign
the
paperwork
the
newspaper
carry
an
announcement
that
perot
have
be
bounce
from
the
gm
board
he
be
no
longer
in
a
position
to
make
any
commitment
on
behalf
of
general
motor
suddenly
george
lucas
found
himself
without
the
buyer
he
have
count
on
this
be
the
opportunity
steve
job
have
be
wait
for
he
begin
negotiation
in
earnest
with
lucas
negotiation
between
steve
and
george
should
have
be
smooth
both
very
much
want
the
sale
and
both
share
a
dedication
to
a
way
of
life
that
emphasizes
tranquility
lucas
describes
his
religious
affiliation
by
comment
let
say
i
be
spiritual
he
explains
that
he
be
raise
methodist
but
it
be
marin
county
we
be
all
buddhist
up
here
he
and
steve
should
have
be
on
the
same
wavelength
steve
be
sting
from
the
wound
of
the
apple
embarrassment
and
want
this
plum
as
a
demonstration
to
the
world
and
especially
the
business
reporter
that
he
be
still
a
player
nonetheless
steve
can
be
a
painfully
difficult
negotiator
and
the
discussion
drag
on
at
one
point
lucas
though
desperate
for
the
cash
could
no
longer
stand
the
ordeal
of
haggle
with
steve
and
announce
he
be
withdraw
from
far
negotiation
steve
be
not
willing
to
give
up
keep
after
lucas
until
he
finally
agree
to
come
back
to
the
table
finally
lucas
and
steve
come
to
term
steve
would
buy
the
entire
operation
staff
computer
software
for
just
under
million
accept
that
figure
barely
one
third
of
the
amount
he
have
originally
aim
for
be
a
bitter
pill
for
lucas
it
would
not
come
close
to
provide
the
sum
he
owe
marcia
in
the
divorce
settlement
still
it
would
take
care
of
the
immediate
pressure
and
he
be
out
of
time
and
other
option
lucas
be
at
least
able
to
walk
away
with
one
concession
that
be
important
to
him
all
advance
that
the
new
company
make
on
the
computer
graphic
software
would
be
provide
to
lucasfilm
free
of
charge
steve
wait
for
the
price
to
come
down
and
then
apply
a
heavy
dose
of
stevian
determination
won
the
day
the
computer
graphic
group
have
shift
its
patronage
once
again
from
the
quirky
alex
schure
to
star
war
commander
lucas
to
the
pirate
king
himself
oddly
in
steve
view
he
be
buying
a
hardware
and
software
company
add
another
computer
firm
to
his
roster
while
alvy
and
ed
still
have
their
dream
pin
to
create
an
animate
feature
a
goal
that
have
become
all
the
more
realistic
with
john
lasseter
and
the
animator
he
have
brought
in
to
join
him
alvy
ray
smith
and
ed
catmull
would
become
cofounder
of
a
new
company

with
percent
of
the
stock
the
other
percent
go
to
their
angel

steve
job
alvy
steve
and
ed
all
want
a
company
name
with
a
high
tech
flavor
not
long
before
alvy
have
dubbed
one
of
their
computer
pixer
which
he
felt
carry
the
suggestion
of
pixel
change
into
a
verb
then
draw
on
his
heritage
of
grow
up
in
a
tex
mex
region
he
amend
that
to
a
name
with
a
spanish
sound
pixar
another

that
alvy
make
the
change
because
the
last
two

initial
pixar
carry
a
flavor
of
technology
and
a
spirit
of
creative
imagination
just
the
right
combination
for
the
new
company
pixar
it
would
be
the
pixar
staff
be
a
bit
squirrelly
nonconformist
to
say
the
least
among
the
forty
or
so
people
in
the
new
company
it
be
not
at
all
uncommon
for
many
to
straggle
in
about
lunchtime
and
then
stay
late
perhaps
work
until
somewhere
around
midnight
steve
job
when
he
show
for
one
of
his
very
rare
appearance
come
in
his
standard
uniform
of
rag
jean
t
shirt
usually
black
and
new
balance
run
shoe
casual
enough
that
he
could
not
have
be
dismayed
to
discover
some
of
the
pixar
crowd
wander
around
in
bare
foot
accord
to
one
report
a
few
of
them
do
not
bathe
very
oftenanother
job
trait
from
his
earlier
day
this
be
a
crowd
whose
member
sense
that
they
be
on
a
new
frontier
of
filmmaking
not
simply
push
an
envelope
others
have
define
but
create
the
outer
limit
of
the
envelope
themselves
steve
later
claimed
that
he
be
tune
in
to
the
pixar
mission
from
the
first
pixar
vision
be
to
tell
story
to
make
real
film

our
vision
be
to
make
the
world
first

feature
filmcompletely
computer
synthetic
set

everything
in

that
be
not
steve
vision
when
he
bought
the
group
from
lucas
and
it
be
not
the
direction
he
first
set
the
company
on
he
have
never
really
understood
software
the
program
that
come
so
easily
to
some
remain
a
dark
mystery
to
steve
job
he
be
basically
a
hardware
guy
with
a
talented
amateur
knowledge
of
software
with
hardware
he
have
prove
to
be
a
visionary
of
course
he
have
mar
one
effort
after
another
by
be
too
much
of
a
visionary
demand
achievement
that
be
not
yet
possible
he
have
stumble
often
by
be
too
much
of
a
perfectionist
begin
way
back
with
the
insistence
on
those
perfect
solder
line
in
the
apple
ii
that
few
purchaser
would
ever
see
or
care
about
despite
all
that
he
clearly
understood
and
have
a
unique
connection
with
aspect
of
the
computer
business
that
involve
thing
you
could
see
touch
and
hold
he
have
demonstrate
a
true
genius
in
pick
designer
of
imagination
and
brilliance
and
then
drive
them
hard
until
he
be
finally
satisfied
he
truly
care
deep
down
where
he
live
and
breathe
about
design
the
macintosh
project
have
deepen
steve
appreciation
for
software
if
not
his
understand
of
what
be
involve
with
it
with
the
mac
user
interface
the
combination
of
hardware
and
software
have
create
a
new
way
of
work
with
computer
although
it
might
have
be
derive
from
the
work
at
xerox
parc
it
be
all
macintosh
now
as
a
result
steve
have
grown
to
value
the
combination
of
operating
system
and
hardware
that
define
the
essence
of
a
computer
by
the
time
he
start
next
he
understood
that
it
be
also
the
application
program
the
software
that
let
user
do
something
with
the
computerthat
matter
now
he
have
bought
a
company
that
be
all
about
use
software
to
create
state
of
the
art
image
in
a
certain
sense
pixar
be
only
a
software
company
and
the
hardware
be
incidental
the
computer
graphic
star
have
built
a
specialty
piece
of
hardware
a
supercomputer
for
the
day
to
handle
their
need
but
it
be
what
they
do
with
it
that
make
all
the
difference
steve
be
not
quite
ready
to
hear
that
message
yet
however
in
palo
alto
steve
have
a
gang
of
earnest
youngster
work
to
design
the
next
as
a
next
generation
computer
an
effort
just
get
start
and
not
likely
to
generate
any
income
for
a
couple
of
year
at
the
early
in
marin
county
though
he
have
just
bought
an
outfit
with
a
serious
computer
that
have
the
potential
of
be
turn
into
a
commercial
product
the
computer
that
the
pixar
team
have
create
be
unique
and
steve
be
determine
to
find
a
way
to
market
it
he
be
blind
by
his
love
for
the
hardware
hardware
that
make
such
an
impression
on
him
true
it
be
a
specialized
machine
tailor
specifically
for
the
computer
graphic
industry
built
with
the
capacity
to
store
a
huge
number
of
extremely
detailed
image
but
steve
always
captivate
by
be
on
the
forefront
of
technology
launch
the
effort
to
turn
the
prototype
into
a
marketable
product
the
result
be
a
machine
that
they
dubbed
unimaginatively
the
pixar
image
computer
it
be
obscenely
expensive
for
any
ordinary
use
with
a
price
tag
of
in
dollar
plus
another
or
so
for
the
software
and
peripheral
such
as
tape
drive
item
that
be
essential
but
not
include
in
the
base
price
what
more
steve
found
ed
and
alvy
ray
woefully
inadequate
at
run
a
business
call
them
babe
in
the
wood
he
thought
he
could
plug
the
hole
in
time
to
keep
the
ship
from
sinking
i
think
i
can
help
turn
alvy
and
ed
into
businessmen
he
say
the
principal
challenge
be
to
find
a
large
market
for
the
pixar
image
computer
they
set
their
sight
on
the
medical
community
because
of
the
need
to

vast
number
of

radiology
lab

on
every
patient
who
have
ever
step
in

of
its

machine
how
much
well
if
all
those
picture
be
on
a
computer
instantly
available
to
the
doctor
with
all
the
new
technology
come
along
mri
and
the
rest
the
image
store
need
be
grow
exponentially
on
top
of
the
money
he
have
already
spent
to
buy
the
company
steve
be
willing
to
provide
additional

of
money
to

force
of
some
twenty
people
despite
the
mammoth
effort
it
be
doom
to
fail
the
truth
be
that
the
pixar
computer
have
be
design
by
specialist
to
be
operate
by
specialist
medical

it

just
too
complicate
the
professional
leader
of

clinic
medical

institute
sat
down
to
listen
to
the
sale
pitch
and
take
the
time
to
see
the
system
for
themselves
then
decide
that
the
learn
curve
be
way
too
steep
with
all
the
time
pressure
on
doctor
and
their
staff
nobody
want
to
dedicate
the
day
that
would
be
need
to
master
the
pixar

computer
to
keep
steve

out
of
the

away
from
the

in

to
sit
down
with
their
benefactor
and
update
him
after
a
while
these
trip
start
to
become
more
and
more
uncomfortable
how
often
can
you
say
the
money
be
flow
out
at
an
extraordinarily
fast
rate
and
damn
little

you
be
do
the
right
thing
by
continue
to
back
us
and
trust
us
and
still
be
believe
so
that
they
would
not
appear
tongue
tie
and
shuffle
foot
the
two
men
would
hammer
out
a
carefully
orchestrate
list
of
discussion

to
provide
a
candid
appraisal
while
at
the
same
time
they
hop
distract
steve
enough
that
he
would
not
ask
difficult
question
the
strategy
be
solid
but
almost
totally
unsuccessful
they
discover
from
the
first
that
steve
engage
captivate
personality
could
overwhelm
the
best
laid
plan
this
be
not
some
clever
manipulative
tactic
it
be
just
steve

be
himself
no
matter
how
well
rehearse
ed
and
alvy
be
no
matter
how
determine
to
stick
to
their
agenda
no
matter
how
many
time
they
have
be
through
the
session
with
steve
before
the
same
thing
almost
invariably
happen
they
would
sit
down
with
steve
get
through
a
few
pleasantry
and
launch
into
their
presentation
steve
would
have
something
else
he
want
to
ask
about
or
talk
about
he
would
interrupt
in
mid
sentence
and
bring
up
whatever
be
on
his
mind
abruptly
alvy
or
ed
would
head
off
in
whatever
direction
steve
want
and
get
far
from
whatever
they
have
come
to
discus
meanwhile
the
other
guy
would
sit
there
far
enough
remove
from
the
scene
that
he
be
wise
to
what
be
happen
but
unable
to
stop
it
eventually
alvy
say
the
two
work
out
a
signal
if
ed
be
get
seduce
by
steve
and
lead
someplace
they
do
not
want
to
go
alvy
would
tug
an
ear
and
vice
versa
that
do
not
necessarily
mean
they
would
be
successful
in
steer
steve
back
to
their
own
agenda
but
at
least
like
a
virgin
be
romance
until
her
brother
arrives
in
time
to
bring
her
to
her
sens
the
one
be

be
awaken
to
what

the
whole

of

be
so
that
he
could
design

of

in
an
upstairs
conference
room
at

it
prove
to
be
one
of
their
most
painful
meeting
ever
none
of
the
pixar
people
have
anticipate
the
disturb
news
that
steve
have
for
them
by
now
feel
considerable
strain
over
the
monthly
expense
at
both
next
and
pixar
steve
have
come
to
the
session
determine
that
big
cutback
need
to
be
make
every
workgroup
at
pixar
would
have
to
let
a
significant
number
of
people
go
the
executive
discuss
each
group
of
the
entire
company
often
weigh
the
pro
and
con
of
specific
individual
the
distress
level
in
the
room
be
almost
palpable
these
men
have
chosen
their
employee
with
extraordinary
care
select
the
bestpeople
not
only
extraordinarily
qualify
but
who
would
also
fit
into
the
nonconventional
rather
anticorporate
culture
that
make
the
company
not
only
highly
productive
but
a
laid
back
fun
place
to
work
pixar
people
be
loyal
to
the
company
and
the
company
be
loyal
to
them
now
the
executive
have
to
come
to
term
with
break
that
bond
of
loyalty
they
understood
steve
reason
from
a
business
standpoint
it
be
a
logical
move
that
do
not
make
it
any
easy
the
session
go
on
for
hour
the
hardest
meeting
we
ever
have
one
of
the
participant
call
it
it
be
like
a
knife
in
the
gut
for
each
of
them
when
they
be
through
steve
ask
be
that
all
and
put
his
hand
on
the

up
and
walk
out
there
be
one
other

for
an
animate
short

at
the
next
siggraph
conference
only
five
month
away
ever
since
the
day
at

what
be
now
the
pixar
team
have
do
a
short
for
siggraph
annual
convention
it
be
always
a
high
point
of
the
gathering
it
have
become
a
kind
of
tradition
everyone
expect
to
see
a
few
minute
of
footage
that
cleverly
show
off
the
group
late
technological
wizardry
within
pixar
an
r
d
team
be
now
hard
at
work
turn
the
software
that
ed
alvy
and
the
others
have
be
evolve
since
the
long
island
day
into
a
commercial
software
product
many
people
in
the
computer
graphic
field
eagerly
await
the
product
and
steve
have
high
hope
that
it
would
begin
to
generate
a
significant
revenue
stream
that
income
add
to
the
revenue
from
sale
of
the
computer
could
ease
the
cash
strain
steve
now
suffer
prospective
buyer
at
siggraph
expect
to
see
another
short
that
would
once
again
dazzle
them
with
breakthrough
technology
if
the
pixar
group
show
up
empty
hand
it
might
be
take
as
a
sign
that
the
company
be
in
trouble
and
would
throw
a
cloud
of
suspicion
over
the
software
undercut
sale
before
the
product
even
reach
the
market
yet
after
the
painful
discussion
that
have
just
take
place
with
steve
which
result
in
cut
several
hundred
thousand
dollar
from
the
budget
how
could
they
ask
him
to
come
up
with
an
almost
equivalent
amount
to
produce
another
short
everyone
sat
still
look
at
his
lap
choked
up
at
the
idea
of
have
to
ask
for
money
at
this
very
awkward
moment
finally
bill
adam
spoke
up
he
explain
about
the
short
say
steve
we
need
to
do
this
and
list
the
reason
why
it
be
essential
for
the
sale
of
the
forthcoming
software
product
the
company
would
have
fifteen
to
twenty
people
work
on
the
short
over
a
period
of
month
for
steve
it
meant
add
hundred
of
thousand
back
to
his
cash
outlay
steve
sat
silently
think
about
this
difficult
request
analyze
the
consequence
of
a
yes
and
the
consequence
of
a
no
finally
he
ask
be
there
storyboards
told
that
there
be
he
ask
to
see
them
the
group
get
up
and
trooped
downstairs
john
lasseter
have
do
his
usual
stellar
job
of
create
a
storyboard
that
capture
not
just
the
look
but
the
emotion
of
the
piece
impressed
steve
agree
to
dig
into
his
pocket
and
fund
the
short
which
would
be
call
tin
toy
if
nobody
have
spoken
up
and
steve
have
walk
out
of
the
room
bill
adam
say
or
if
he
have
not
agree
to
spend
money
tin
toy
would
not
have
be
make
and
without
tin

i
do
not
believe
disney
would
ever
have
come
to
the
table
to
fund
pixar
movie
production
steve
despite
feel
so
pinch
that
a
significant
number
of
staff
people
have
to
be
fire
be
willing
to
spend
a
large
chunk
of
money
on
what
be
essentially
a
promotional
film
it
be
a
pivotal
moment
in
pixar
history
month
later
lasseter
and
reef
be
back
at
the
oscar
with
their
nominate
short
tin
toy
as
if
the
earlier
challenge
have
not
be
difficult
enough
this
time
they
have
set
themselves
the
hurdle
of
animate
a
person
or
more
accurately
a
crawl
stumble

aside
you
do
not
have
to
be
an
animator
or
a
software
engineer
to
appreciate
the
achievement
that
this
little
picture
represent
the
member
of
the
motion
picture
academy
clearly
felt
that
way
they
award
the
oscar
for
animate
short
to
tin
toy
the
first
time
the
award
have
ever
go
to
a
film
make
entirely
by
computer
animation
while
continue
the
effort
to
find
market
for
pixar
computer
the
company
have
manage
to
present
the
animation
world
with
a
new
product
in
a
software
package
call
renderman
in
simplest
term
it
represent
put
into
a
box
the
fruit
of
the
team
labor
from
its
early
day
on
long
island
renderman
become
a
crutch
for
steve
provide
the
little
company
with
much
need
cash
flow
the
process
of
render
be
best
understood
by
analogy
think
of
rembrandt
stand
at
a
canvas
ready
to
begin
a
painting
seat
in
front
of
him
be
a
model
whom
the
artist
have
cloaked
in
an
elaborate
gown
and
provide
with
sparkle
earring
and
a
glitter
necklace
the
artist
have
arrange
the
furniture
that
will
appear
in
the
picture
and
he
have
pose
the
model
so
that
light
flow
into
the
room
strike
the
model
at
just
the
right
angle
the
artist
do
not
start
by
painting
the
face
or
the
contour
of
the
figure
instead
he
start
by
visualize
the
anatomy
the
bone
and
the
muscle
in
a
sense
he
begin
with
the
basic
structure
and
work
toward
the
surface
the
process
of
create
a
scene
for
an
animate
film
begin
in
a
similar
way
modeler
start
by
define
the
room
or
other
set
for
an
interior
this
will
include
where
and
how
far
apart
the
wall
be
the
furniture
piece
their
shape
and
location
and
so
on
other
specialist
add
the
color
and
the
texture
detail
for
each
item
shaders
add
the
light
information
where
the
light
be
come
from
and
how
it
be
reflect
by
every
part
of
every
object
because
the
camera
will
show
the
scene
from
several
different
angle
this
detail
must
be
define
for
degree
of
the
entire
set
all
of
this

with
the

of
the
pixar
computer

the
film
do
draw
the
attention
of
prospective
computer
buyer
but
not
much
else
pixar
could
barely
give
its
computer
away
they
be
simply
too
complicate
to
use
and
far
too
expensive
a
handful
be
sell
to
university
and
a
number
be
purchase
by
the
intelligence
community
for
use
in
analyze
satellite
image
in
connection
with
the

the

demand
that
every
company
executive
be
clear
for
top
secret
everyone
in
the
computer
group
who
would
work
with
satellite
photo
need
an
even
high
clearance
these
be
mostly
marin
county
superliberals
and
the
whole
idea
do
not
sit
well
at
first
bad
the
intelligence
community
refer
to
this
as
a
black
project
which
give
the
work
a
sinister
connotation
still
once
they
get
up
to
speed
many
found
the
work
fascinate
one
pixar
executive
be
sit
in
steve
office
discuss
some
current
issue
when
a
call
come
in
for
steve
from
a
government
security
investigator
for
five
or
ten
minute
the
executive
say
steve
sat
there
answer
question
a
lot
of
them
about
his
drug
use
he
seem
annoyed
by
the
call
but
answer
candidly
and
straightforwardly
without
ever
ask
the
executive
to
leave
the
caller
would
ask
a
question
and
steve
would
answer
the
last
time
i
use
that
be
about
and
then
he
would
give
a
date
or
say
how
long
ago
once
or
twice
he
answer
that
no
he
have
never
use
whatever
it
be
the
caller
have
just
ask
about
the
executive
explain
that
you
be
suppose
to
list
information
about
your
drug
use
on
the
application
form
for
the
security
clearance
apparently
steve
have
not
do
that
so
now
they
be
ask
him
over
the
telephone
if
you
be
honest
about
your
drug
use
the
executive
say
then
you
be
probably
okay
lie
about
it
suggests
you
be
hiding
something
that
might
leave
you
open
to
blackmail
and
give
away
secret
when
steve
finish
the
call
he
look
at
the
executive
with
a
wry
smile
and
ask
do
i
do
okay
the
executive
answer
i
guess
so
and
they
laugh
together
steve
be
willing
to
go
through
that
embarrassment
the
executive
believe
because
he
knew
how
important
the
security
clearance
would
be
the
intelligence
agency
promise
to
be
a
big
customer
for
pixar
in
the
end
the
intelligence
community
bought
well
over
a
million
dollar
worth
of
pixar
image
computer
even
so
by
not
many
more
than
a
hundred
of
the
machine
have
be
purchase
the
company
be
tear
through
money
at
an
alarm
ratenearly
million
a
month
yet
despite
money
be
extremely
tight
steve
could
be
his
old
irascible
unreliable
self
in
dealing
with
potential
customer
on
one
occasion
a
lead
firm
in
the
computer
industry
take
an
interest
in
the
renderman
software
which
it
want
to
adapt
for
a
consumer
version
and
sell
to
the
general
public
high
level
executive
of
the
two

flew
back
and
forth
for
three
month
hammer
out
the
deal
they
reach
an
accord
one
that
would
have
be
very
lucrative
for
pixar
steve
have
be
kept
in
the
loop
all
through
the
negotiation
but
when
it
come
time
to
sign
he
announce
that
he
have
change
his
mind
he
do
not
want
to
do
the
deal
after
all
accord
to
one
insider
the
executive
of
the
other
company
be
livid
steve
do
not
care
what
more
he
do
not
bother
give
any
reason
or
excuse
he
do
not
have
to
he
be
steve
job
the
year
prove
to
be
a
painful
time
for
steve
despite
the
glitz
and
glamour
of
introduce
his
groundbreaking
sexy
look
next
computer
accompany
by
the

lavish
fair
haired

make
a
comeback
coverage
in
the
popular
press
the
next
computer
be
doom
the
situation
at
next
and
pixar
be
curiously
parallel
at
next
the
computer
product
be
a
bomb
set
to
explode
and
at
pixar
the
computer
be
similarly
doom
steve
have
always
want
to
be
see
as
a
cool
hardware
impresario
but
be
strike
out
badly
every
time
at
bat
meanwhile
ironically
both
company
have
broken
new
ground
on
the
software
front
steve
have
originally
conceive
of
next
as
a
company
that
would
produce
software
tool
product
use
by
developer
in
create
new
software
application
on
a
visit
to
carnegie
mellon
a
university
with
one
of
the
best
reputation
in
the
country
for
its
computer
research
steve
learn
about
a
new
type
of
kernel
the
software
element
at
the
heart
of
a
computer
operating
system
even
for
someone
lack
in
an
understand
of
software
steve
be
excite
by
the
potential
of
this
arcane
mass
of
program
code
which
have
be
dubbed
mach
one
of
the
most
important
part
of
the
mach
approach
be
call
object
orient
program
this
be
a
way
to
encapsulate
the
program
code
for
often
use
item
or
object
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
be
use
over
and
over
by
many
program
it
supposedly
simplify
the
brutal
black
art
of
write
software
steve
be
still
always
look
for
new
idea
that
would
show
him
to
be
in
the
forefront
of
technology
and
he
be
convince
that
mach
fit
the
description
in
the
aftermath
of
that
carnegie
mellon
visit
he
make
a
decision
that
would
have
long
reach
impact
next
would
not
develop
software
tool
but
would
be
a
company
that
built
computer
differentiate
by
run
an
advanced
operating
system
that
next
would
create
an
o
base
on
mach
to
make
it
happen
he
recruit
avie
tevanian
a
key
member
of
the
mach
team
while
the
next
computer
in
the
end
never
generate
enough
sale
to
grab
a
permanent
place
in
the
market
the
sharp
capable
software
team
avie
assemble
laid
the
groundwork
that
eventually
surprised
them
all
and
lead
the
company
out
of
the
wilderness
the
unexpected
parallel
in
steve
other
life
at
pixar
be
stun
on
the
software
side
renderman
become
a
solid

earner
software
of
course

very
high

manual
if
one
be

the

that
contain
the

for
that
matter
in
many
case
even
the
box
cost
more
than
the
actual
software
medium
with
software
like
renderman
carry
a
price
tag
of
thousand
of
dollar
you
do
not
have
to

vast
quantity
to
experience
revenue
that
make
executive
and
owner
smile
on
the
hardware
side
of

steve
have
take
a
batter
ever
since
the

be
announce
the
grand
plan
of

scatter
across
the
country
and
a
beefed
up
army
of

have
do
little
more
than
burn
money
hardly
anyone
be
answer
the
knock
incredibly
for
month
steve
have
threaten
to
fire
john
lasseter
and
his
animator
because
the
little
film
they
turn
out
be
a
luxury
the
company
could
not
afford
steve
personal
financial
adviser
have
give
steve
message
that
he
do
not
want
to
hear
next
have
burn
through
a
huge
amount
of
money
but
at
least
it
be
not
all
steve
there
be
perot
million
and
canon
whop
million
steve
himself
have
kick
in
only
only
million
but
the
cost
of
develop
and
marketing
a
computer
that
everyone
admire
but
few
want
to
pay
for
have
by
this
time
nearly
clean
out
the
piggy
bank
yet
next
actually
look
good
when
compare
to
the
truly
ugly
financial
picture
at
pixar
layoff
continued
finally
steve
have
to
face
a
painful
reality
the
two
company
be
bleeding
him
dry
from
be
one
of
the
richest
men
in
the
united
state
richer
by
far
at
the
time
than
bill
gate
steve
now
have
a
dwindle
fortune
of
a
mere
for
him
million
if
he
continued
to
keep
the
two
company
afloat
out
of
his
own
pocket
he
would
soon
be
sell
off
his
precious
german
sport
car
and
the
still
unfurnished
mansion
that
have
be
his
home
for
year
steve
finally
make
a
decision
that
he
would
dread
and
resist
for
too
long
the
pixar
computer
have
achieve
some
notable
sale
but
almost
exclusively
in
niche
market
mainly
to
university
and
medical
customer
and
the
intelligence
community
bill
adam
hardworking
sale
force
have
even
manage
to
achieve
sale
overseas
in
europe
australia
japan
and
china
but
these
be
not
enough
to
justify
the
product
steve
finally
admit
to
himself
that
the
pixar
computer
be
not
go
to
sell
widely
enough
to
justify
continue
the
effort
he
have
be
chase
a
fantasy
by
this
time
adam
have
just
left
pixar
today
he
remembers
steve
as
the
smartest
man
i
ever
met
and
acknowledges
that
he
would
work
for
him
again
happily
steve
ask
bill
to
take
on
a
short
term

a
number
of
the

steve
several
million

it
easy
to

with
people
closest
to
you
when
your
defeat
be
meat
for

it
can
be
humiliate
for
someone
like
steve

there
be
no
place
to
hide
he
could
have

seem
curiously
muddle

talk
impromptu
for
an

to
concentrate
people
in
the

who
knew

baffle
the
explanation
be
simple
steve
be
smitten
his
gaze
have
settle
on
a
young
woman
so
irresistible
that
just
look

with

thought
of
ask
her
to

but
already
have
plan
so
he
left
then
he
felt
an
emotional
tug
too
powerful
to
resist
one
of
those
this
may
be
a
door
to
the
rest
of
my
life
moment

i
be
in
the

about

shot
in

tuesday
in
mid
september
steve
once
again
take
the
trip
to
san
francisco
for
a
launch
session
to
announce
the
product
that
he
believe
would
turn
his
fortune
around
this
be
the
new
next
computer
call
the
nextstation
and
design
to
address
the
shortcoming
that
have
make
the
original
machine
celebrate
and
admire
but
not
purchase
the
new
next
gleam
with
the
same
shiny
black
magnesium
case
this
time
not
in
the
distinctive
cube
shape
that
have
be
so
costly
to
manufacture
instead
the
shape
be
more
conventional
but
still
distinctive
enough
to
be
refer
to
as
the
pizza
box
many
would
be
buyer
have
be
put
off
by
the
black
and
white
display
in
a
world
of
computer
go
color
the
nextstation
boast
a
color
display
which
steve
show
off
at
the
launch
meeting
with
the
kind
of
dramatics
he
love
he
have
have
his
staff
license
a
scene
from
the
wizard
of
oz
in
which
the
image
turn
from
black
and
white
to
color
the
audience
roar
its
enthusiastic
approval
the
unbridled
enthusiasm
die
as
soon
as
the
show
be
over
the
new
computer
be
less
expensive
than
the
original
next
but
still
cost
thousand
of
dollar
more
than
the
machine
it
have
to
compete
with
it
become
painfully
evident
that
steve
have
blindly
run
down
the
same
path
that
have
lead
him
into
the
thorn
bush
in
the
past
great
design
even
world
class
design
be
not
enough
to
sell
a
computer
maybe
design
be
enough
to
sell
sunglass
lamp
or
top
caliber
fountain
pen
but
not
computer
it
be
easy
to
admire
the
late
breathtakingly
gorgeous
young
starlet
even
if
her
brainpower
do
not
measure
up
but
that
do
not
mean
you
want
her
to
help
you
get
your
work
do
for
the
next
few
year
most
buyer
do
not
pick
computer
solely
on
good
look
either
if
steve
job
be
such
a
brilliant
guy
such
a
world
class
marketer
why
do
he
still
keep
make
the
same
obvious
mistake
when
the
nextstation
prove
to
be
yet
another
disaster
steve
finally
face
up
to
the
truth
the
holy
stevian
empire
be
collapse
he
consider
closing
the
door
on
both
company
and
get
out
of
business
altogether
but
he
have
be
in
business
since
his
part
time
job
at
the
electronic
part
shop
as
a
teen
wake
up
in
the
morning
without
a
company
to
run
or
challenge
business
decision
to
make
seem
like
a
bleak
miserable
uninviting
way
to
live
under
the
circumstance
shut
down
the
business
be
undeniably
the
only
real
choice
yet
it
seem
unthinkable
steve
close
his
eye
to
logic
and
common
sense
instead
he
tighten
his
belt
and
cross
his
finger
in
this
case
belt
tighten
meant
slash
the
workforce
at
pixar
again
he
order
nearly
one
third
of
the
staff
to
be
laid
off
go
against
standard
business
practice
he
refuse
the
idea
of
severance
pay
the
employee
be
fire
even
people
who
have
be
with
the
team
for
year
would
be
paid
the
money
they
be
due
but
nothing
more
it
be
cruel
and
cold
hearted
but
steve
be
not
in
a
position
to
be
generous
one
group
at
pixar
be
again
spar
the
chop
block
john

animation
team
have
not
just
an

in
their

for

generate
a

that
more
than

once
again
the
animator
squeak
past
a
cutback
as
it
would
turn
out
luck
be
once
again
very
much
on
steve
side
steve
job
like
people
who
have
the
gut
to
stand
up
to
him
but
with
a
very
demand
limitation
this
apply
only
to
people
he
respect
people
who
have
a
real
contribution
to
make
and
whom
he
could
look
on
in
some
respect
as
his
equal
for
anyone
else
who
try
to
talk
back
to
steve
his
time
at
the
company
would
probably
come
to
an
abrupt
end
there
be
some
flexibility
here
however
apple
engineer
alex
fielding
once
sent
steve
a
strongly
word
e
mail
complain
about
the
fire
of
another
engineer
whose
work
be
crucial
steve
sent
back
a
reply
if
you
feel
that
way
you
should
probably
leave
the
company
but
he
do
not
insist
and
alex
last
another
six
month
alvy
ray
smith
be
one
of
the
people
whom
steve
would
take
gaff
from
since
they
have
start
work
together
alvy
never
have
a
problem
look
steve
in
the
eye
and
tell
him
he
be
wrong
about
something
steve
might
not
change
his
mind
but
he
would
not
blow
a
gasket
he
at
least
listen
and
possibly
even
consider
the
point
of
view
all
of
that
change
in
a
blinding
flash
at
one
pixar
meeting
steve
have
certain
territorial
imperative
like
have
the
right
kind
of
bottle
water
laid
out
for
a
meeting
and
ownership
of
the
whiteboard
be
a
strange
quirk
of
his
a
part
of
his
need
for
total
control
at
this
particular
pixar
meeting
alvy
disagreed
with
what
steve
have
say
and
be
write
on
the
whiteboard
alvy
thought
steve
be
wrong
he
stood
up
walk
to
the
whiteboard
picked
up
a
marker
and
begin
to
explain
his
disagreement
while
write
on
the
board
everyone
in
the
room
watch
in
fascinate
horror
as
steve
job
implode
you
ca
not
do
that
steve
screech
alvy
be
stun
and
speechless
as
steve
lean
into
him
until
their
nose
almost
touch
and
hurl
insult
meant
to
demean
belittle
and
wound
then
steve
storm
out
of
the
room
it
be
ugly
alvy
say
afterward
steve
turn
on
me
with
everything
he
have
even
today
alvy
remains
sensitive
about
reopen
the
wound
from
steve
irrational
undisciplined
little
boy
with
a
bigtemper
outburst
and
from
what
follow
alvy
now
say
i
be
rather
pleased
to
have
gotten
over
my
animus
against
steve
and
be
not
interested
in
revive
it

noncommittal
disney
still
have

up
with

james

have
show
hollywood

a

weapon
to

never

possible
after
confer
with
studio
bos
michael
eisner
katzenberg
contact
lasseter
to
make
a
remarkable
counteroffer
disney
be
opening
the
door
for
pixar
to
produce
a
full
length
animate
feature
which
disney
would
fund
promote
and
distribute
for

the
news
come
as
a
lifesaver
a
feature
film
for
disney
with
the
studio
pour
in
enough
money
to
keep
pixar
solvent
not
a
measly
television
production
but
a
full
length
film
to
be
distribute
by
disney
and
show
at
your
local
neighborhood
theater
around
the
world
amaze
for
steve

the
news
could
not
have
be
well
but
he
be
not
one
to
share
his
gloom
and
sense
of
doom
when
thing
be
darkest
and
now
that
some
light
have
broken
through
the
cloud
he
be
not
about
to
dance
down
the
corridor
of
pixar
or
clap
ed
or
john
in
affectionate
thankful
hug
yet
even
if
he
do
not
show
it
outwardly
he
knew
that
they
have
just
brought
home
his
salvation
gift
wrap
by
katzenberg
and
the
disney
organization
there
be
not
any
specific
yet
but
a
deal
with
disney
would
mean
ten
of
million
of
dollar
flow
into
the
pixar
coffer
steve
would
not
face
the
public
humiliation
of
have
to
close
down
the
company
he
begin
the
wait
for
the
call
from
disney
earlier
steve
have
see
the
deal
with
ibm
come
to
nothing
as
a
result
of
his
own
delay
now
the
pixar
deal
with
disney
be
drag
on
with
nothing
happen
if
the
much
need
disney
cash
do
not
show
up
soon
steve
might
have
to
shut
the
door
not
just
on
pixar
but
on
next
as
well
snatch
spare
time
from
work
on
the
television
commercial
that
provide
some
measure
of
cash
flow
john
lasseter
be
jotting
story
note
and
fill
draw
pad
with
character
and
scene
idea
but
disney
have
not
agree
to
a
story
concept
yet
bad
the
disney
people
be
not
even
set
up
meeting
to
hammer
out
the
deal
term
the
word
come
from
john
old
contact
at
disney
could
not
have
be
more
discourage
katzenberg
desire
to
go
outside
the
studio
and
have
another
company
produce
an
entire
disney
animate
film
on
its
own
flew
in
the
face
of
mouseworks
tradition
in
business
for
more
than
half
a
century
the
company
have
never
do
this
with
the
studio
seemingly
unable
to
break
its
string
of
mediocre
animate
film
katzenberg
be
willing
to
go
against
tradition
and
roll
the
dice
with
outsider
pixar
have
john
lasseter
which
lent
strength
to
the
project
on
the
artistic
front
and
pixar
knew
how
to
make
an
animate
film
use
computer
which
meant
that
it
could
be
do
for
vastly
less
money
than
in
the
traditional
disney
way
which
often
involve
hundred
of
people
in
the
creation
of
a
single
film
to
katzenberg
it
just
make
good
business
sense
to
try
the
story
that
get
back
to
pixar
make
it
sound
as
if
katzenberg
number
two
man
peter
schneider
might
be
hold
to
a
stick
with
tradition
viewpoint
and
his
foot
drag
or
counterargument
might
be
win
the
day
schneider
now
say
it
be
not
true
that
he
never
oppose
the
arrangement
but
a
source
within
the
company
contradicts
this
say
that
he
thought
schneider
be
conflict
he
be
not
sure
that
lasseter
would
not
make
him
look
bad
in
the
end
because
peter
would
have
everyone
believe
he
be
the
only
one
capable
of
make
great
animate
film
and
here
be
somebody
else
who
be
make
great
animate
film
a
pixar
executive
who
be
privy
to
the
negotiation
say
peter
be
very
oppose
to
the
whole
thing
but
jeffrey
say
let
give
it
a
try
this
d
computer
base
animation
may
be
the
future
katzenberg
this
executive
say
have
the
vision
up
north
at
pixar
it
begin
to
look
as
if
do
a
feature
film
for
disney
might
never
happen
finally
the
pixar
power
decide
on
a
strategy
that
combine
the
hopeful
with
the
manipulative
they
begin
to
have
meeting
with
other
studio
in
town
if
any
of
these
studio
executive
be
willing
to
take
time
to
have
lunch
at
a
place
that
above
theline
industry
type
favor
like
the
polo
lounge
the
bel
air
hotel
or
the
ivy
be
see
with
them
would
make
it
all
the
well
the
plot
apparently
work
jeffrey
katzenberg
sent
word
that
he
want
to
meet
with
steve
job
steve
come
attend
by
ed
catmull
and
two
others
they
be
show
into
jeffrey
conference
room
adjoin
his
office
where
they
found
a
very
long
conference
table
steve
size
up
the
situation
intuitively
if
he
sat
along
one
side
jeffrey
would
take
his
customary
seat
at
the
end
and
everyone
else
steve
include
would
be
subservient
steve
sat
himself
down
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
the
two
royal
would
face
each
other
as
equal
the
pixar
contingent
must
have
be
laugh
inside
when
jeffrey
come
in
and
announce
that
if
pixar
animator
want
to
do
a
project
for
disney
they
be
to
talk
only
to
disney
pixar
have
manage
to
pull
jeffrey
katzenberg
chain
it
be
the
steve
job
style
to
negotiate
as
if
he
hold
a
position
of
strength
he
negotiates
that
way
even
when
the
card
be
stack
against
him
katzenberg
do
not
know
just
how
weak
steve
position
be
that
he
could
no
longer
afford
to
keep
financing
his
two
company
and
have
essentially
run
out
of
option
for
produce
income
at
either
of
them
at
least
not
enough
income
to
make
the
company
viable
for
the
long
term
yet
steve
intuitively
understood
that
he
need
to
speak
up
to
jeffrey
katzenberg
as
if
they
be
bargaining
from
equally
strong
position
steve
insist
that
disney
would
be
funding
production
work
only
the
deal
would
not
involve
pixar
sell
the
right
to
any
technology
jeffrey
act
as
if
disney
be
the
be
all
and
end
all
and
pixar
just
a
gnat
say
former
pixar
executive
pam
kerwin
all
the
revenue
from
video
sale
would
go
to
disney
he
told
steve
pixar
would
not
participate
still
he
be
not
just
talk
about
one
film
he
be
talk
about
three
jeffrey
now
lead
steve
onto
the
main
battlefield
the
discussion
of
the
production
budget
and
how
the
pie
of
profit
would
be
slice
pixar
would
receive
percent
of
the
net
jeffrey
say
it
be
doubtful
that
steve
or
ed
catmull
even
knew
what
a
reasonable
number
be
this
be
hollywood
insider
stuff
information
you
could
not
find
in
any
book
only
a
handful
of
people
at
the
top
of
the
studio
structure
and
their
lawyer
knew
whether
percent
represent
a
royal
screw
steve
must
have
be
hold
his
breath
the
size
of
the
production
budget
be
key
big
enough
and
it
would
mean
the
survival
of
pixar
steve
ed
and
john
have
go
over
the
number
thoroughly
but
it
be
not
like
a
math
problem
on
the
sat
if
people
can
create
a
minute
animate
film
in
month
how
many
people
will
it
take
to
create
a
minute
film
in
year
there
be
so
many
intangible
bad
whole
element
of
filmmaking
be
complete
unknown
to
these
nervous
neophyte
how
much
do
you
need
to
budget
for
a
musical
score
orchestration
and
record
session
how
much
for
each
of
the
a
list
movie
star
to
record
the
voice
how
much
for
the

bond
the
insurance
policy
that
protects
against
some
indispensable
member
of
the
production
team
fall
victim
to
a
terrible
ailment
partway
through
one
publish
account
describes
how
jeffrey
force
steve
to
announce
a
production
budget
figure
then
say
disney
would
not
spend
that
and
seduce
steve
into
accept
a
much
low
figure
when
all
the
time
the
original
figure
steve
have
name
be
significantly
under
what
the
studio
have
be
spending
per
picture
it
be
a
good
story
but
not
the
way
the
card
be
played
accord
to
pam
kerwin
disney
understood
that
the
pixar
guy
do
not
know
how
to
budget
an
animate
feature
she
say
we
figure
out
the
cost
in
collaboration
with
disney
it
be
in
the
common
interest
of
both
side
to
arrive
at
a
budget
that
make
sense
all
around
for
steve
the
important
part
be
that
disney
would
put
up
the
full
cost
of
production
if
pixar
stayed
within
budget
steve
would
not
have
to
reach
into
his
own
pocket
if
the
picture
go
over
budget
he
would
be
on
the
line
for
as
much
as
million
he
would
remain
on
edge
about
that
million
commitment
during
most
of
the
time
it
take
to
produce
the
film
demand
report
and
assurance
at
frequent
interval
that
the
cost
remain
in
line
but
that
be
all
ahead
on
the
day
of
the
katzenberg
meeting
steve
walk
out
with
a
handshake
commitment
for
a
three
picture
deal
with
the
most
prestigious
company
in
the
history
of
animate
film
a
deal
that
would
save
him
and
his
company
a
deal
that
would
eventually
lead
to
his
become
successful
even
beyond
his
dream
now
all
he
have
to
do
be
wait
for
the

not
heard
from
jeffrey

about
move
ahead
go
back
to
look
for
some
way
to
dig
himself
out
of
the
bad
financial
hole
he
have
ever
be
in
with
the
business
press
ready
to
write
about

finally
disney
get

touch
to
say
it
be
ready
to
move
ahead
with
the
contract
negotiation
steve
go
on
a
hunt
for
an
appropriate
entertainment
attorney
to
advise
him
in
the
deal
make
after
consider
lead
talent
like
the
esteem
ira
epstein
a
found
partner
of
cooper
epstein
hurwitz
he
decide
on
harry
brittenham
whose
client
roster
include
people
like
harrison
ford
and
the
lead
independent
film
producer
in
hollywood
bob
and
harvey
weinstein
of
miramax
brittenham
know
as
skip
be
a
short
thin
man
described
as
low
key
by
people
who
know
him
personally
and
as
have
an
outsized
personality
by
others
in
a
town
fill
with
big
ticket
attorney
he
be
ranked
among
the
fifty
high
earner
and
be
consider
one
of
the
top
two
or
three
powerhouse
among
entertainment
lawyer
it
turn
out
that
disney

have
be
busy
all
along
with
the
legal
department
draft
term
and
key
executive
review
and
call
for
change
because
this
be
break
new
ground
for
the
studio
as
the
first
ever
animation
production
to
be
outsource
proceed
with
due
caution
make
sense
for
steve
ed
and
john
though
it
would
have
be
a
less
antsy
less
anxious
time
if
the
disney
people
have
kept
them
post
with
progress
report
now
that
negotiation
be
move
ahead
steve
flew
to
burbank
from
time
to
time
to
sit
down
with
jeffrey
katzenberg
and
go
over
detail
of
the
contract
on
a
charter
aircraft
no
way
he
be
not
spending
money
frivolously
at
this
point
he
flew
southwest
stand
in
line
like
any
tourist
or
businessman
on
a
budget
pam
kerwin
say
the
pixar
people
rode
southwest
from
oakland
to
burbank
so
often
that
they
nickname
it
the
southwest
bus
she
recall
one
later
occasion
when
steve
decide
after
their
meeting
that
he
want
to
experience
the
fun
of
the
jurassic
park
ride
on
the
universal
studio
tour
he
make
a
phone
call
that
get
them
to
the
front
of
the
line
and
onto
the
ride
we
go
to
the
airport
soak
wet
she
recall
in
the
deal
that
be
finally
put
on
the
table
disney
in
addition
to
pick
up
the
production
cost
would
also
fund
the
promotion
and
the
distribution
pixar
would
develop
all
the
creative
aspect
character
character
appearance
screenplay
dialogue
cast
of
actor
for
the
voice
and
so
on
disney
would
of
course
retain
approval
power
over
all
creative
decision
but
that
be
fine
with
the
pixar
team
who
would
complain
about
have
the
expertise
and
the
creative
sensitivity
of
seventy
year
of
animation
heritage
as
a
sound
board
the
overall
term
follow
the
line
that
have
be
laid
down
by
katzenberg
in
the
initial
meeting
along
with
two
item
that
have
not
yet
come
up
john
lasseter
would
have
to
sign
a
long
term
contract
binding
him
to
stay
on
board
for
all
three
of
the
picture
cover
by
the
agreement
katzenberg
be
adamant
after
the
tin
toy
oscar
he
have
try
to
entice
john
back
to
disney
promising
creative
freedom
on
his
own
production
john
have
reply
that
at
disney
he
could
make
movie
at
pixar
he
could
make
history
if
katzenberg
could
not
have
john
this
deal
be
at
least
a
guaranteed
way
to
acquire
his
talent
so
a
commitment
from
john
be
a
deal
breaker
he
would
commit
to
stay
the
course
or
the
deal
be
off
john
agree
if
it
be
nice
to
be
want
it
be
even
nicer
to
be
fought
over
the
second
new
term
say
that
disney
would
keep
the
income
from
merchandising
royalty
toy
game
fast
food
tie
in
and
all
the
rest
when
steve
later
saw
how
much
this
add
up
to
he
figure
out
a
way
to
cut
pixar
in
on
subsequent
film
with

over
a
period
of
month
they

of
session
that
some
claim
he
could
have

a
successful
career
as

around
tell
everyone
how
much
work
be

full
year

the
basic
tool
of
the
hollywood

craft
by
signing
up
for
a
cram
course
in
los

the

one
that

parody
in

though
some
people
ridicule
the

for
its

of
hidebound
rule
and
proscriptive
do
and
do
nots
lasseter
write
clearly
do
not
suffer
from
the

have
all
of
the
top
disney

knew
what

developed
for
a

that
would
carry

have
prevail
in
his
drive

a
thumb
up
from

description
of

pin
up

instead
of

card
if
you
have
visit
pixar
in
the
early
s
you
would
have
found
hallway
enliven
by
an
impromptu
art
show
of
sketch
for
successive
moment
in
a
scene
with

toss
out
idea
on
how
to
make
the

john
to
look
at
a
series
of
image
and
envision
every
aspect
of
the
action
then
rattle
off

of
suggestion
from
which

or
how
he

how
he
show
a
reaction
to
what
he
see
john
have
sense
early
in
his
career
that
it
take
more
than

skill
to
be
a
superior
animator
for

he
insist
on

he

only
thing
i
ever
turn
down
that
i
felt
bad
about
he
manage

for
a
particular

they
not

also
watch
video
of
the

talent
reading
the

review
the

and
the
dialogue
repeatedly
until
they
have
command
of
every
nuance
start
to
work
on
the
scene
they
animate
the
movement
of
the

first
then
add
the

john
have
a
work
knowledge
of
everything
say
visual
effect
supervisor
tom
porter
who
also
work
as
a
shader
he
well
know
when
you
can
do
something
well
and
be
not
the
least
bit
hesitant
about
call
on
people
to
try
again
yet
he
invariably
manages
to
give
these
order
in
a
way
that
make
people
feel
challenged
instead
of
scold
or
put
down
after
lasseter
morning
visit
to
the
animator
bullpen
he
usually
hustle
to
a
screen
session
with
the
light
team
where
they
scrutinize
scene
that
be
ready
or
almost
ready
for
final
approval
and
transfer
to
film
here
john
the
director
become
john
the
perfectionist
at
his
most
ardent
change
the
character
of
the
light
even
subtly
could
reshape
the
mood
of
the
entire
scene
redirect
the
viewer
attention
or
convey
a
different
message
what
do
john
originally
want
the
scene
to
express
what
story
point
or
character
revelation
would
that
goal
be
well
achieve
by
shift
the
key
light
of
the
scene
to
come
from
here
instead
of
there
or
by
add
a
fill
light
from
the
side
or
could
the
scene
make
an
even
strong
point
than
the
one
he
originally
have
in
mind
there
be
no
need
to
rebuild
a
set
and
reassemble
the
actor
in
this
new
world
it
be
one
of
the
continue
miracle
of
computer
base
filmmaking
that
these
change
can
be
achieve
with
hardly
more
effort
than
the
wave
of
a
magician
wand
even
if
there
be
a
lot
of
computer
horsepower
behind
it
the
director
have
so
many
more
option
that
he
becomes
a
merlin
able
to
reshape
reality
with
a
simple
command
a
visitor
to
one
of
these
session
watch
as
lasseter
and
his
light
team
study
a
scene
in
which
the
viewer
look
out
a
window
cover
with
raindrop
each
drop
be
a
lens
john
coached
and
should
reflect
everything
that
be
go
on
outside
let
add
fifty
more
so
people
wo
not
miss
the
effect
lasseter
feel
that
an
animate
film
need
to
convey
the
same
sense
of
believability
to
the
eye
as
a
live
action
film
that
extends
to
the
small
detail
his
team
create
a
dozen
different
filth
library
for
thing
such
as
give
baseboard
in
a
bedroom
mark
that
make
it
look
scuffed
by
kick
from
child
shoe
few
people
would
ever
notice
but
this
kind
of
think
extend
to
camera
move
as
well
layout
supervisor
craig
good
explain
we
try
to
do
what
we
could
do
on
a
set
with
real
tripod
and
crane
we
deliberately
borrow
shot
from
live
action
director
all
of
this
be
do
by
call
on
equation
and
algorithm
store
in
the
computer
mathematical
statement
that
be
developed
and
refine
over
the
year
some
trace
their
root
all
the
way
back
to
the
alex
schure
day
and
earlier
become
more
powerful
but
also
more
complex
as
an
example
technical
director
bill
reef
explains
that
it
be
amaze
how
big
our
shaders
be
they
use
to
be
a
few
line
of
code
now
some
of
them
be
ten
to
twelve
page
a
shader
be
a
block
of
software
that
describes
a
surface
and
defines
how
the
surface
reflect
and
bounce
light
once
a
scene
receive
john
final
benediction
it
be
sent
off
to
the
renderfarm
a
factory
of
three
hundred
sun
microsystems
workstation
where
the
complex
information
for
each
scene
be
render
into
pixel
frame
by
frame
ready
to
be
translate
onto
motion
picture
film
thirty
five
millimeter
film
speed
through
the
projector
of
your
local
multiplex
at
the
rate
of
frame
per
second
and
there
be
some
frame
in
the
complete
toy
story
the
render
process
can
take
as
much
as
five
hour
for
each
frame
of
film
which
explains
why
the
pixar
renderfarm
have
so
many
computer
while
steve
have
plenty
of
reason
to
be
happy
about
the
progress
be
make
at
pixar
his
other
company
next
be
on
a
roller
coaster
steve
thought
he
might
have
a
solution
to
the
problem
when
he
manage
to
entice
away
from
microsoft
mike
slade
a
marketing
whiz
with
a
spectacular
success
record
to
pump
some
life
into
next
sale
as
its
new
director
of
marketing
with
the
hard
drive
slade
onboard
employee
morale
picked
up
dramatically
and
so
do
sale
multiply
fourfold
it
be
incredible
to
think
that
a
fourfold
leap
in
sale
would
not
be
enough
but
it
be
not
in
all
of
next
sell
only
twenty
thousand
computer
if
pixar
have
ever
sell
that
many
everyone
would
have
be
pop
champagne
cork
for
next
it
be
pathetic
apple
be
sell
more
computer
than
that
every
week
steve
be
not
in
a
position
to
pour
in
any
more
money
of
his
ownnot
without
jeopardizing
his
entire
future
by
january
though
the
picture
be
more
encourage
next
have
report
annual
sale
of
million
and
steve
be
make
aggressive
statement
we
enter
the
commercial
workstation
market
several
year
ago
and
our
market
share
be
about
half
of
sun
and
grow
watch
for
us
to
continue
take
market
share
away
from
sun
in
fact
the
picture
be
only
a
little
brighter
steve
prediction
come
more
from
his
blind
self
deceive
optimism
than
it
do
from
the
reality
of
the
marketplace
the
people
at
canon
however
impressed
by
the
sale
increase
at
next
and
not
eager
to
see
their
hundred
million
dollar
investment
go
down
the
drain
decide
to
put
in
another
million
to
keep
the
company
afloat
the
promise
of
new
money
come
with
a
demand
canon
be
by
now
convince
that
steve
be
a
large
part
of
the
problem
and
make
it
a
condition
of
the
new
contribution
that
he
hand
over
a
large
measure
of
control
to
a
new
executive
of
canon
choose
for
steve
it
be
a
painful
choice
this
be
almost
like
a
replay
of
john
sculley
take
apple
computer
away
from
him
but
the
alternative
be
closing
the
door
throw
a
lot
of
people
out
of
work
and
suffer
humiliation
from
the
ridicule
the
press
would
heap
on
him
he
agree
no
one
would
ever
argue
that
steve
job
be
not
a
nightmare
to
work
for
from
time
to
time
yet
his
remarkable
charisma
the
mysterious
attraction
that
drew
people
to
him
even
when
they
knew
he
might
attack
at
any
moment
create
a
degree
of
loyalty
that
few
executive
ever
match
have
a
new
co
chief
of
next
might
have
look
like
a
good
idea
on
paper
from
a
management
perspective
but
it
be
not
exactly
a
winner
with
the
staff
key
people
begin
to
hand
in
their
resignation
the
vice
president
of
marketing
left
then
the
vice
president
of
sale
then
the
chief
of
hardware
the
last
remain
cofounder
of
the
company
this
ranked
among
steve
darkest
moment
but
it
be
to
get
even
bad
canon
million
be
soon
go
the
japanese
company
pour
in
still
more
possibly
as
much
as
another
million
for
a
total
of
million
accord
to
wire
by
steve
have
to
face
the
reality
the
only
way
to
keep
next
afloat
any
longer
be
by
shut
down
the
hardware
business
a
reporter
who
interviewed
him
when
the
decision
become
public
found
him
fragile
depressed
and
withdrawn
ross
perot
become
disillusion
with
steve
management
style
bail
out
and
write
off
his
investment
steve
could
hardly
have
know
at
this
dark
moment
that
what
remain
of
next
the
impressive
nextstation
operating
system
software
base
on
the
mach
kernel
from
carnegie
mellon
would
prove
to
be
the
springboard
for
his
great
triumph
john
lasseter
knew
he
be
bless
to
have
the
disney
tradition
and
experience
behind
him
he
be
good
great
even
and
the
disney
animate
picture
have
be
falter
lately
but
disney
be
still
unquestionably
the
industry
giant
with
an
acquire
sense
of
what
audience
would
respond
to
still
the
attitude
of
some
of
the
disney
people
toward
their
northern
partner
be
not
so
much
paternalistic
as
patronize
that
be
reflect
in
remark
by
animation
president
peter
schneider
we
act
like
partner
be
suppose
to
act
schneider
say
we
look
every
day
at
what
they
be
do
we
demand
we
push
we
talk
which
he
insist
lead
to
a
well
product
be
peter
schneider
he
could
not
resist
a
dig
who
get
the
credit
really
be
never
the
issue
for
us
although
i
know
sometimes
it
be
for
steve
job
one
of
his
fellow
executive
thought
that
schneider
be
now
conflict
over
a
new
concern
about
toy
story
and
pixar
if
he
have
originally
oppose
the
project
and
it
turn
out
to
be
a
success
it
would
make
him
look
like
a
poor
judge
of
people
and
of
material
if
it
fail
he
would
be
just
another
disney
animation
executive
backing
project
that
reach
the
screen
and
could
not
find
an
audience
toy
story
be
john
lasseter
baby
but
john
knew
he
have
to
keep
schneider
and
katzenberg
happy
at
regular
interval
john
and
his
team
assemble
the
rough
art
sketch
for
an
upcoming
scene
and
put
them
under
the
camera
to
create
a
crude
film
storyboard
john
would
hop
on
a
flight
to
burbank
and
play
the
footage
for
katzenberg
and
schneider
while
act
out
the
role
and
provide
a
run
description
of
the
action
john
respect
katzenberg
for
his
experience
and
insight
katzenberg
respect
lasseter
for
his
obvious
talent
and
creative
genius
with
steve
too
the
relationship
be
solid
and
it
go
beyond
merely
professional
katzenberg
have
even
developed
enough
respect
and
admiration
for
the
pixar
ceo
that
he
invite
steve
to
his
home
for
dinner
but
now
jeffrey
katzenberg
be
troubled
something
about
the
story
simply
be
not
work
for
him
he
knew
what
he
do
not
like
just
not
how
to
fix
it
on
a
small
point
when
the
story
be
drag
jeffrey
have
remarkable
antenna
for
sense
something
be
wrong
and
he
would
spring
one
of
his
favorite
line
they
be
go
for
popcorn
meaning
you
be
boring
them
yet
what
they
now
struggle
with
be
not
something
small
lasseter
knew
the
pixar
animator
be
break
new
ground
achieve
thing
no
one
in
the
field
have
thought
possible
the
work
look
great
it
glowed
he
be
excite
about
what
they
be
achieve
but
jeffrey
katzenberg
be
unhappy
and
it
be
not
just
a
little
popcorn
problem
the
problem
be
one
that
katzenberg
could
not
put
his
finger
on
and
lasseter
could
not
yet
recognize
because
it
be
so
fundamental
the
concept
for
the
entire
story
have
sprung
from
lasseter
fascination
with
the
idea
of
bring
toy
to
life
through
animation
a
theme
that
have
run
through
his
award
win
demo
reel
at
pixar

with
the
lamp
in

which
he
have

as
plaything
start
from
there
john
and
his
write
team
have
originally
fashion
a
story
about
a
tin
soldier
left
behind
at
a
highway
rest
stop
and
the
hazard
and
the
adventure
he

to
find
his
way
home
screenwriter
andrew
stanton
one
of
the
writer
on
the
film
say
that
over
a
period
of
month
the
writer
conceive
buzz
and
woody
as
the
two
main
character
woody
the
old
fashion
cowboy
and
buzz
the
with
it
astronaut
with
the
spaceman
gadget
they
would
fight
over
who
would
be
the
favorite
stanton
say
then
the
two
would
get
lose
and
have
to
learn
to
work
together
to
get
back
home
but
the
write
team
have
go
astray
on
the
character
development
woody
and
buzz
need
different
personality
good
drama
demand
that
their
personality
or
goal
would
have
to
clash
again
as
require
for
dramatic
conflict
but
even
more
as
a
basic
element
of
the
formula
for
buddy
film
before
they
join
force
to
overcome
a
common
threat
or
enemy
in
try
to
meet
those
essential
though
the
writer
have
be
too
influence
by
movie
like
lethal
weapon
with
its
screw
you
attitude
of
the
mel
gibson
character
not
exactly
the
right
inspiration
for
woody
and
buzz
the
script
do
not
convey
a
fun
mood
for
an
audience
of
child
even
if
their
parent
might
enjoy
the
sharpedged
humor

it
have
be
an
excite
landmark
when
jeffrey
katzenberg
allow
the
picture
to
advance
from
script
to
production
in
mid

now
month
later
he
still
be
not
happy
john

back
with
new
idea
but
none
of
them
offer
a
solution
to
what
bother
jeffrey
like
the
early
hollywood
mogul
jeffrey
be
incredibly
astute
about
what
audience
would
connect
with
and
warm
to
he
could
tell
you
in
an
instant
if
there
be
a
problem
the
difficulty
be
that
he
could
not
tell
you
how
to
fix
it
on
november
a
date
that
the

he

that
be
not
the
bad
part
the

many
hollywood

that

some
of
the
others

in
that
fateful

the
water

in

one
person
he
do
not
consider
at

be
curiously
enough
a
close
friend
michael
ovitz
head
of
the
talent
firm
creative
artist
agency
and
one
of
the
most
powerful
men
in
hollywood
ovitz
have
a
different
set
of
qualification
chief
among
them
his
close
tie
to
almost
everyone
of

in

almost
cutthroat
drive

benefit
his
client
he
be
at
the
top
of
the
pyramid
of
agent
in
town
once
eisner
start
to
think
about
ovitz
as
a
well
replacement
however
he
have
to
be
subtle
about
negotiation
the
infamous
industry
gossip
mill
could
spoil
any
deal
before
it
ever
get
to
the
table
in
a
curious
sense
the
dealing
that
michael
eisner
now
enter
into
with

would
be
like
a
rehearsal
for

would
be
badly
mar
by

on
the
subject
ovitz
respond
with
i
be
ready
for
a
change
and
we
would
make
an
unbeatable
team
eisner
sense
that
they
would
pass
a
threshold
then
ovitz
float
his
version
of
the
arrangement
between
them
we
should
be
co
ceo
eisner
immediately
understood
that
his
vision
of
ovitz
as
a
replacement
of
frank
well
as
a
number
two
instead
of
a
co
equal
be
not
the
same
role
that
ovitz
saw
for
himself
shortly
after
eisner
begin
to
have
pain
that
land
him
in

he
told

he
be

name
two

barry
diller
who
have
be
chairman
of

when

he
also

in

time
shut
down
a

often
they
would
start
it
back
up
again
when
the
kink
be
work
out
disney
be
not
happy
with
the
script
lean
on
the
writer
to
come
up
with
a
solution
it
be

if
the

already
try
as
usual
with
such
thing
when
they
found
the
answer
it
seem
obvious
the
challenge
be
that
they
could
not
change
woody
character
so
much
that
it
would
take
away
all
the
edginess

they
finally
realize
that
they
do
not
have
to
they
write
some
new
scene
for
the
early
part
of

up

as
a
good
guy
helpful
to
the

with

absorbed
once

buzz
lightyear
who

fill
with
high

in

when

dealt
with

million
of
dollar
yet
carry
such
a
high
chance

when

spent
much
of
their

in

perhaps
to
make
the

else
leave
them

they
would
not
know
which
for
another

a
half

very
briefly

his
seven
year
as
disney
president
of

he
have
be
largely
responsible
for

with
a
series
of

the

and
soon
the
lion

his
personality
style
seem
to
brim
with
self
confidence
and
he
be
sure
that
he
be
a
shoo
in
for
the
number
two
slot
but
the
chemistry
between
eisner
and
katzenberg
be
wrong
friction
have
be
building
for
month
between
them
date
back

immediately
after
the

eisner
set
up
a
private
lunch
katzenberg
do
not
bother
with
social
nicety
as
soon
as
the
two
sat
down
katzenberg
unleashed
an
attack
i
ca
not
believe
you
do
not
offer
me
the
job
as
president
as
soon
as
you
found
out
about

after
eighteen

aside
from

in
bring
up
the
topic
at
this
point
eisner
have
great
reservation
about
his
qualification
for
the
position
find
him
secretive
and
pursue
his
own
agenda
instead
of
act
for
the
overall
good
of
the
company
bad
katzenberg
do
not
have
the
support
of
the
disney
board
roy
disney
the
only
family
member
represent
on
the
board
have
specifically
caution
eisner
that
he
do
not
believe
jeffrey
katzenberg
to
be
ready
for
the
job
and
other
board
member
have
apparently
express
similar
opinion
by
the
end
of
lunch
katzenberg
have
state
his
outright
intention
to
quit
his
job
and
leave
the
company
unless
he
be
give
frank
well
position
as
president
of
the
walt
disney
company
that
put
michael
eisner
into
an
extremely
uncomfortable
corner
he
later
write
for
jeffrey
to
quit
immediately
after
frank
death
would
only
prompt
more
medium
attention
compound
the
company
trauma
and
exacerbate
the
sense
of
anxiety
that
our
employee
be
already
feel
there
be
practical
issue
as
well
over
the
next
week
disney
would
be
opening
beauty
and
the
beast
on
broadway
follow
by
the
lion
king
in
movie
theater
i
be
especially
loath
to
lose
jeffrey
before
these
project
be
launch
eisner
write
the
hard
edge
jeffrey
katzenberg
felt
that
he
have
earn
his
bone
he
deserve
the
number
two
slot
and
he
be
certain
that
he
have
michael
eisner
up
against
the
wall
eisner
meanwhile
felt
torn
i
be
fed
up
angry
and
absolutely
convince
that
the
only
solution
be
to
let
jeffrey
quit
on
another
level
i
still
value
his
strength
run
our
movie
division
but
eisner
understood
that
he
need
to
assume
the
bad
and
he
be
correct
when
katzenberg
learn
that
he
would
be
pass
over
he
paid
eisner
back
by
leave
in
a
blaze
of
medium
story
first
there
be
the
question
of
whether
he
quit
or
be
fire
then
journalist
delighted
over
the
idea
that
katzenberg
have
found
a
way
to
poke
a
stick
in
eisner
rib
he
join
with
david
geffen
and
steven
spielberg
to
form
the
high
profile
new
studio
to
open
its
door
in
hollywood
for
decade
dreamworks
skg
eisner
be
left
not
only
short
a
top
executive
but
with
a
major
new
competitor

bid
against

above
the
line
talent
producer
writer
director
and
actor
and
a
new
studio
to
juggle
against
for

then
katzenberg
demand
million
that
he
say
be
owe
him
by
disney
under
his
contract
base
on
the

for
year
at
one
point
the
two
side
agree
on
some
million
as
a
compromise
but
eisner
nixed
the
deal
that
prove
to
be
a
costly
decision
when
the
matter
be
finally
settle
disney

even
more
than
the

katzenberg
have
originally

of
a

enthusiasm
he

not
closing
down
the

hardware
manufacturing
and
sale
operation
have
relieve
much
of
the

brought
only
temporary
relief
by
the
company
be
in
far
deeper

out
and
all
of
the
original
team
of
next
founder
as
well
as
most
of
the
early
hire
be
go
steve
surround
himself
with
a
new
crowd
of
executive
who
be
willing
to
be
take
in
by
his
aura
and
believe
in
his
compelling
vision
but
none
of
it
be
enough
nextstep
be
dead
in
the
water
the
company
have
create
version
that
ran
on
the
intel
chip
and
on
sun
sparcsta
tions
so
there
be
a
broad
target

for
all
the
ease
of

that
object
orientation
promise
few
customer
step
forward
the
picture
be
grow
darker
and
darker
nonetheless
steve
refuse
to
throw
in
the
towel
meanwhile
pixar
be
now
take
in
million
annually
from
the
sale
of
renderman
software
as
well
as
the
regular
infusion
of

funding
from
disney
although
the
cash
flow
crunch
have
ease
it

a
never

source
of

steve
grouse
to
fortune
brent
schlender
if
i
knew
in
how
much
it
be
go
to
cost
to
keep
pixar
go
i
doubt
if
i
would
have
bought
the
company
he
have
do
the
calculation
toy
story
would
have
to
bring
in
more
money
at
the
box
office
than
any
recent
disney
film
just
to
be
a
wash
only
if
the
film
earn
at
least
million
would
pixar
actually
make
any
money
lasseter
and
catmull
be
spectacular
but
could
these
first
timer
really
turn
out
a
picture
that
would
out
disney
disney
steve
have
come
to
understand
what
he
so
blithely
have
agree
to
when
katzenberg
insist
on
keep
the
merchandising
revenue
if
toy
story
be
only
a
modest
success
steve
would
see
barely
a
trickle
of
income
from
the
profit
while
disney
might
rake
in
handsome
revenue
from
the
sale
of
toy
game
t
shirt
chocolate
bar
and
the
rest
he
be
such
a
great
negotiator
and
katzenberg
have
snooker
him
just
think
about
it
rankle
steve
he
be
so
distressed
by
pixar
financial
plight
that
he
begin
to
look
for
an
out
actually
make
inquiry
to
several
company
reportedly
even
to
microsoft
hop
that
someone
would
put
an
offer
on
the
table
so
that
he
could
at
least
have
the
option
of
sell
out
and
walk
away
with
his
head
held
high
he
stop
look
when
michael
eisner
make
what
be
for
steve
a
monumental
decision
with
eisner
proclaim
it
both
a
spectacular
movie
and
a
lovable
movie
the
studio
advise
steve
that
toy
story
release
would
be
postpone
because
it
would
be
disney
holiday
release
it
would
not
just
be
drop
into
the
fall
winter
release
schedule
but
would
reap
all
the
benefit
of
the
christmas
holiday
season
when
parent
become
enthusiastic
about
discover
any

they
can

child
toy
story
would
open
in
november
god
willing
and
steve
be
gird
himself
for
the
effort
of
make
a
pixar
ipo
happen
steve
want
to
launch
the
company
just
after
the
opening
of
toy
story
he
be
desperate
to
get
off
the
hook
for
endlessly
bankrolling
the
company
and
a
public
offering
would
also
give
him
the
cash
he
need
to
resurrect
his
finance
if
the
movie
prove
to
be
a
success
or
even
only
a
moderate
success
but
generate
a
lot
of
medium
attention
which
steve
could
bank
on
with
the
power
of
the
disney
promotion
machine
behind
the
film
the
publicity
for
the
film
would
draw
attention
to
the
ipo
as
well
he
would
be
rid
a
wave
of
free
press
worth
million
of
dollar
the
timing
seem
propitious
the
people
who
refuse
to
accept
conventional
wisdom
be
more
often
the
one
who
provide
the
most
stun
breakthrough
steve
with
his
usual
chutzpah
chose
to
ignore
the
downside
pixar
be
a
highly
unlikely
candidate
for
an
ipo
what
sensible
investor
would
want
to
put
money
into
a
company
that
have
be
in
business
for
nearly
a
decade
but
have
yet
to
turn
a
profit
sure
in
the
go
go
year
of
internet
invest
that
lay
just
ahead
pour
money
into
a
start
up
base
on
little
more
than
its
future
expectation
would
be
commonplace
but
this
be
still
at
the
very
begin
of
the
wave
steve
have
be
living
with
the
deaden
pain
of
failure
if
nothing
else
you
might
have
thought
that
his
stanford
m
b
a
wife
would
have
be
able
to
convince
him
that
try
to
arrange
an
ipo
for
a
cash
starve
unprofitable
company
be
folly
steve
have
always
live
on
determination
and
audacity
if
he
be
often
hit
in
the
face
with
a
wet
fish
for
dare
thing
that
more
cautious
men
knew
well
than
to
try
this
same
determination
and
audacity
kept
him
afloat
still
in
there
swing
while
more
cautious
type
have
already
drop
off
and
crawl
out
of
sight
he
start
to
look
for
investment
banker
know
that
he
need
people
who
would
be
on
the
same
wavelength
which
meant
people
he
could
cast
his
spell
over
he
be
eager
to
see
some
qualify
financial
worker
bee
start
to
draw
up
the
ton
of
paperwork
that
would
be
need
to
file
an
intention
to
sell
security
to
the
public
and
there
be
so
many
decision
to
be
make
about
how
the
income
would
be
split
meanwhile
his
home
life
become
even
more
of
a
pleasure
to
many
who
have
watch
him
in
his
bachelor
day
steve
as
a
family
man
and
a
devote
father
seem
almost
unthinkable
but
to
see
him
with
reed
be
to
recognize
a
truly
dedicate
and
love
father
now
the
family
be
expand
as
if
he
do
not
already

enough
on
his
plate

around

with
a
recede
hairline
and
eye
that
need

he

have

able

slow
down

for
type
a

that

heaped
on
him
in

of

challenged
with
one
of

and
why

allow
door
of
possibility
to
remain

and
the
subject
of
ovitz
join
the
house
of
mouse
found
its
way
into
numerous
conversation
eisner
need
for
help
in
run
the
giant
business
have
become
even
more
press
the
previous
year
have
see
eisner
mammoth
effort
to
purchase
the
abc
television
network
pay
off
that
acquisition
alone
have
more
than
double
the
size
of
disney
operation
and
eisner
be
still
handle
all
of
frank
well
former
responsibility
heaped
on
top
of
his
own
the
pressure
on
him
be
way
beyond
enormous
and
he
felt
the
strain
in
august
eisner
decide
to
heave
caution
to
the
hurricane
follow
his
gut
and
make
an
offer
to
ovitz
before
the
insidious
rumor
mill
spoil
the
chance
of
it
happen
at
all
for
his
part
ovitz
be
apprehensive
about
his
own
company
get
wind
of
his
imminent
departure
and
cause
a
panic
before
he
have
a
chance
to
tell
people
in
his
own
way
eisner
have
decide
to
offer
a
million
salary
a
figure
he
knew
ovitz
would
consider
chump
change
compare
to
the
nearly
million
he
have
be
draw
from
his
agency
but
ovitz
would
eisner
hop
be
lure
by
the
promise
of
stock
option
base
on
profit
performance
the
same
arrangement
eisner
himself
have
this
could
be
vastly
lucrative
enough
to
make
up
for
the
ownership
stake
in
caa
that
ovitz
would
be
walk
away
from
a
pile
of
gold
that
eisner
understood
to
be
value
at
more
than
million
eisner
main
concern
be
whether
ovitz
would
be
more
willing
than
he
have
be
the
year
before
to
take
a
position
as
second
in
command
instead
of
as
a
co
head
share
equal
power
if
the
answer
be
a
sufficiently
enthusiastic
yes
eisner
write
i
be
strongly
inclined
to
go
with
him
they
met
in
aspen
where
the
two
spent
an
entire
day
go
over
salary
and
stock
option
duty
and
responsibility
and
myriad
other
detail
ovitz
ask
for
time
to
speak
to
his
wife
he
call
eisner
a
short
while
later
and
say
i
be
put
myself
in
your
hand
let
go
forward
eisner
hung
up
and
almost
immediately
put
in
an
unfathomable
call
to
tony
schwartz
the
writer
who
at
the
time
be
actively
engage
in
coauthoring
eisner
autobiography
the
choice
of
confidant
seem
curious
but
eisner
have
unburdened
himself
to
schwartz
about
so
many
personal
thing
that
one
more
be
perhaps
understandable
reach
the
writer
on
the
phone
eisner
blurt
out
i
think
i
just
make
the
big
mistake
of
my
career
later
the
same
even
ovitz
do
in
from
the
day
overdose
of
deal
make
arrive
to
join
his
wife
at
their
aspen
home

ask
how
the
day
have
go
incredibly
his
response
be
i
just
make
the
big
mistake
of
my
career
this
be
an
exceedingly
important
decision
for
the
two
men
and
for
the
walt
disney
company
and
all
its
stockholder
and
both
men
immediately
after
the
decision
be
make
conclude
that
it
be
disastrously
wrong
yet
both
felt
bound
by
the
strength
of
their
personal
friendship
and
their
business
value
to
honor
the
commitment
they
have
make
to
each
other
i
just
make
the

many
people
who
knew
steve
job
well
the
book
read
like
a
painful
expose
of
mona
brother
journalist
steve
lohr
sat
down
a
few
month
later
to
interview
steve
for
a
profile
in
the
new
york
time
magazine
this
be
a
period
in
his
life
when
steve
have
be
extremely
uncomfortable
about
medium
interview
toughen
journalist
quaked
at
ask
him
question
have
heard
story
of
how
he
have
blown
up
or
go
to
piece
in
front
of
one
of
their
peer
nonetheless
lohr
dive
in
he
later
described
the
moment
in
his
article
first
point
out
that
give
the
similarity
between
tom
owen
and
steve
job
most
of
the
book
reviewer
have
mention
the
simpson
job
family
tie
it
would
be
hard
not
to
notice
lohr
ask
the
difficult
question
how
much
of
himself
do
steve
see
in
the
character
in
his
sister
book
about
percent
of
it
be
totally
me
right
down
to
the
mannerism
steve
admit
he
quickly
add
and
i
be
certainly
not
tell
you
which
percent
the
journalist
follow
up
by
ask
whether
job
felt
exploit
or
betrayed
steve
give
a
dismissive
wave
of
course
not
he
say
it
be
a
novel
accord
to
alan
deutschman
in
the
second
come
of
steve
job
a
writer
work
on
a
story
contact
mona
who
say
that
although
steve
continued
to
call
now
and
then
he
have
almost
completely
broken
off
the
relationship
with
her
because
of
the
book
whether
or
not
that
source
be
reliable
mona
simpson
now
denies
she
ever
say
this
she
insists
that
the
report
that
steve
have
broken
off
with
her
because
of
the
book
be
totally
wrong
and
untrue
this
be
back
up
by
her
editor
at
knopf
gary
fisketjon
who
say
he
have
never
heard
such
a
statement
gil
amelio
saw
a
new
update
operating
system
as
a
key
element
to
apple
regain
market
share
against
window
machine
but
he
finally
give
up
hope
that
the
in
house
development
group
would
ever
arrive
at
a
finish
product
in
desperation
he
and
his
chief
technology
officer
ellen
hancock
start
to
make
overture
to
sun
in
hope
of
licensing
its
software
as
the
basis
for
a
new
generation
of
apple
machine
then
a
different
suggestion
be
brought
to
gil
if
apple
have
to
go
outside
the
company
for
an
operating
system
at
least
he
should
talk
to
jean
louis
gassee
under
sculley
gassee
move
from
be
marketing
director
to
become
head
of
macintosh
development
gassee
be
a
perfectionist
however
unable
to
let
go
of
a
project
until
he
be
fully
satisfied
which
on
one
project
after
another
have
begin
to
seem
to
sculley
like
never
the
usually
soft
spoken
sculley
and
this
hottempered
frenchman
clashed
often
and
loudly
in
battle
that
become
silicon
valley
legend
sculley
finally
show
gassee
the
door
jean
louis
may
have
thought
that
a
blessing
use
the
million
severance
that
sculley
arrange
and
bring
in
outside
investor
jean
louis
be
able
to
start
his
own
software
company
be
inc
which
focus
on
develop
an
alternative
operating
system
to
run
on
macintosh
hardware
fit
out
with
several
innovative
feature
it
be
the
darling
of
the
cognoscenti
but
like
jean
louis
project
at
apple
never
seem
to
reach
a
state
where
the
company
be
able
to
launch
it
as
a
major
product
in
the
six
year
he
have
be
run
the
company
he
have
ship
very
little
and
take
in
only
a
pittance
of
sale
revenue
even
so
his
software
be
far
enough
along
to
serve
as
the
basis
for
a
project
that
could
be
brought
into
apple
and
finish
quickly
gil
be
under
pressure
to
sign
a
deal
before
the
upcoming
macworld
expo
in
january
so
that
he
would
have
a
realistic
answerand
he
hop
a
realistic
release
date
to
offer
to
shareholder
and
the
apple
faithful
meanwhile
bill
gate
have
thrown
his
hat
into
the
ring
he
besiege
gil
with
daily
phone
call
argue
that
window
nt
could
be
convert
to
become
the
new
apple
operating
system
and
insist
that
i
will
put
hundred
of
people
on
the
project
to
get
it
do
quickly
of
course
gate
want
something
in
return
not
just
cash
but
something
much
big
apple
be
really
good
at
the
human
interface
much
well
than
we
be
he
admit
gate
hop
to
use
the
promise
of
an
operating
system
solution
that
gil
so
desperately
need
as
a
wedge
to
coerce
gil
into
signing
the
intellectual
property
agreement
gate
have
be
angle
for
in
gil
phrase
that
would
give
microsoft
window
the
same
charm
that
the
macintosh
operating
system
have
the
offer
from
gate
make
a
certain
kind
of
sense
yet
gil
knew
that
any
deal
with
microsoft
would
inflame
the
passion
of
apple
loyalist
and
employee
as
well
as
of
many
shareholder
microsoft
be
the
enemy
and
a
deal
with
gate
would
be
see
as
a
sell
out
one
day
ellen
hancock
receive
a
phone
call
she
remembers
that
the
caller
say
i
hear
you
be

the
guy
on

of
the

be
an
engineer
work
for

a
team
of
her
engineer
and
sent
them
over
they
make
several
trip
and
the
report
be
favorable
in
fact
gil
have
be
want
to
talk
to
steve
about
whether
his
nextstep
software
might
be
a
viable
option
for
apple
but
have
be
unsure
about
reach
out
to
him
finally
the
next
engineer
broke
the
news
to
their
bos
steve
job
that
they
be
in
conversation
with
apple
for
steve
this
have
to
be
stun
news
his
mind
must
have
be
spin
with
the
possibility
the
idea
of
licensing
the
sun
software
be
still
on
the
table
while
negotiation
with
be
inc
drag
on
through
october
and
november
at
one
point
jean
louis
flew
to
hawaii
where
gil
be
attend
an
apple
sale
force
meeting
just
to
be
able
to
sit
down
with
gil
and
plead
his
case
gil
be
lean
toward
jean
louis
software
call
beos
as
the
best
technological
solution
when
gil
ask
about
price
jean
louis
reply
money
do
not
matter
to
me
i
do
not
get
involve
with
price
and
suggest
that
he
would
accept
whatever
price
be
deem
fair
the
story
of
gassee
meeting
with
gil
be
leak
to
the
press
gil
be
sure
that
jean
louis
be
the
source
of
the
leak
suspect
it
to
be
an
attempt
to
force
his
hand
but
it
do
something
else
there
be
no
one
in
the
technology
business
steve
job
hat
more
than
jean
louis
gassee
the
man
who
have
rat
on
his
plan
to
sculley
if
ever
steve
need
a
reason
to
swallow
his
pride
apple
impend
purchase
of
beos
be
it
by
the
time
he
show
up
in
the
first
week
of
december
steve
have
prepared
his
ammunition
meeting
with
gil
and
ellen
he
launch
into
a
pitch
that
be
steve
job
at
his
best
at
some
of
the
most
challenge
moment
in
his
business
life
he
give
the
impression
that
he
have
do
no
preparation
and
have
not
bother
with
any
rehearsal
because
he
simply
do
not
need
them
he
speaks
with
the
fluency
of
someone
in
total
command
of
his
subject
the
passion
of
someone
totally
commit
and
exactly
the
right
control
over
his
listener
emotion
it
be
a
remarkable
performance
so
convincing
that
you
could
listen
for
an
hour
without
interrupt
so
compelling
that
you
wonder
whether
he
might
not
have
have
an
amazingly
successful
career
as
another
jack
nicholson
or
jeff
bridge
that
day
he
start
out
by
give
the
reason
why
the
be
operating
system
would
be
a
disaster
for
apple
and
then
almost
as
an
afterthought
slip
into
his
main
theme
if
you
think
there
be
something
for
you
in
next
i
will
structure
any
kind
of
deal
you
want
license
the
software
sell
you
the
company
whatever
you
want
then
come
the
main
pitch
when
you
take
a
close
look
you
will
decide
you
want
more
than
my
software
you
will
want
to
buy
the
whole
company
and
take
all
the
people
gil
promise
to
have
an
apple
technical
team
get
together
with
counterpart
at
next
the
truth
be
that
the
company
of
both
steve
and
jean
louis
have
good
software
but
be
sinking
fast
both
men
be
desperately
hop
that
gil
amelio
and
apple
would
throw
them
a
lifeline
and
save
them
from
drown
nonetheless
jean
louis
who
have
proclaim
no
interest
in
the
money
sent
in
an
offer
to
sell
his
company
in
exchange
for
share
represent
percent
of
apple
gil
do
a
little
mental
arithmetic
the
figure
come
to
about
million
he
call
jean
louis
and
say
you
have
zero
sale
you
have
get
an
operating
system
that
be
three
year
away
from
any
reality
and
you
want
percent
of
the
company
that
be
not
in
the
card
that
be
not
even
within
the
realm
of
possibility
jean
louis
eventually
come
down
to
million
still
more
than
gil
be
willing
to
pay
for
beos

frenchman

ellen
say
that
jean
louis
have
told
her
i
do
not
think
you
have
any
other
option
gil
have
ellen
assemble
panel
of
in

to
evaluate
the
plus
and
minus
of

to
get
a
decision
make
quickly
the
evaluation
team
drew
up
two
set
of
parameter
for
measure
each

their
analysis
show
that
while
jean
louis
software
be
already
capable
of
run
on
the
macintosh
it
have
a
number
of
shortcoming
for
one
thing
every
time
the

need
to

update
every
third
party

handily
by
a
score
of
to
gil
own
evaluation
have
brought
him
to
the
same
conclusion
the
final
decision
be
too
important
and
involve
too
much
money
for
gil
to
be
comfortable
make
it
alone
he
invite
steve
and
jeanlouis
each
to
appear
before
the
entire
apple
executive
team
and
make
their
case
the
session
be
held
on

at
the

have
be
have
a
field
day
with
the
story
steve

go
first
and
again
be
brilliant
and
compelling
pragmatic
specific
and
precise
gil
later
call
it
then
he
hand
off
to
avie
tevanian
his
top
technical
guru
tevanian
have
brought
along
a
laptop
to
demonstrate
that
nextstep
be
not
just
an
idea
in
progress
but
a
function
operating
system
the
two
of
them
put
on
a
gold
star
presentation
they
be
follow
by
jean
louis
who
either
misunderstood
that
this
be
a
shoot
out
and
his
final
opportunity
or
be
so
certain
of
a
decision
in
his
favor
that
he
do
not
think
he
have
to
do
anything
more
than
show
up
he
arrive
alone
empty

not

anything
much
more
than

question
gil
write
later
that
everything
point
toward
steve

and
next
but
jean
louis
have
make
it
a
no
contest
the
vote
for
next
be
almost
a
foregone
conclusion
some
insider
thought
that
gassee
software
would
have
be
the
well
solution
look
back
from
the
perspective
of
all
these
year
jean
louis
disagrees
insist
that
gil
final
decision
be
the
correct
one
but
this
may
be
the
season
judgment
of
a
man
sensibly
unwilling
to
flagellate
himself
for
past
action
i
be
way
past
be
critical
jean
louis
say
gil
need
to
talk
number
with
steve
but
have
to
do
it
out
of
sight
of
enquire
eye
they
met
at
steve
home
and
steve
make
tea
for
them
the
first
number
steve
put
on
the
table
be
a
share
gil
write
later
that
be
high
but
i
be
figure
we
be
pick
up
an
exist
operating
system
we
be
pick
up
million
a
year
in
additional
revenue
from
next
sale
we
be
pick
up
webobjects
and
i
be
get
a
team
of
about
very
talented
people
all
of
these
be
thing
i
would
not
have
gotten
in
a
deal
with
jean
louis
this
be
obviously
worth
more
but
how
much
more
the
due
diligence
calculation
have
be
run
gil
knew
what
they
show
the
company
be
worth
but
in
a
strategic
situation
like
this
when
the
acquisition
be
critical
to
the
future
of
the
company
the
price
be
largely
irrelevant
he
have
in
mind
that
even
an
additional
million
would
represent
only
three
day
of
sale
for
apple
he
told
steve
i
think
i
have
a
shot
at
convincing
the
board
to
take
do
not
think
i
can
get
a
penny
more
than
that
steve
agree
within
a
week
the
board
approve
the
purchase
of
next
for
million
in
cash
and
million
apple
share
the
cash
go
to
pay
back
investor
the
share
be
all
steve
gil
designate
steve
as
a
special
adviser
and
in
hope
of
restore
some
of
the
pizzazz
glory
and
enthusiasm
of
the
company
early
day
convince
woz
to
accept
a
similar
honorary
position
at
the
same
time
but
while
amelio
breathe
a
sigh
of
relief
and
thought
that
he
have
craft
a
way
to
give
apple
momentum
again
the
story
be
much
more
complicate

michael
ovitz
have
be
the
number
two
executive
of
the
walt
disney
company
for
fourteen
month
fourteen
ugly
month
perhaps
there
would
have
be
some
solace
for
eisner
if
he
could
have
see
his
struggle
with
ovitz
as
an
opportunity
to
learn
lesson
he
could
use
profitably
in
the
struggle
he
would
soon
face
with
steve
job
but
that
would
have
require
uncommon
foresight
as
it
be
eisner
be
too
busy
run
disney
and
contend
with
the
ovitz
war
to
look
for
lesson
in
it
all
michael
ovitz
well
deserve
and
undisputed

as
a
power
titan
in
hollywood
which
have
initially
seem
such
an
attraction
carry
with
it
the
seed
of
a
grow
aggravation
here
be
a

who
have
spent
twelve
year
get
use
to
be
in
charge
as
the
ceo
of
his
own
immensely
successful
company
he
be
completely
unaccustomed
to
the
political
gamesmanship
and
etiquette
need
to
work
beneath
a
top
man
his
proven
track
record
be
built
on
his
ability
to

it
be
universally
know
that
he
have
his
own
distinct
way
of
go
about
that
early
on
eisner
praise
ovitz
as
be
professional
attractive
and
competent
in
a
letter
to
board

enjoy
his
energy

less
than
a
year
later
an
e
mail
to
a
studio
public
relation
chief
found
eisner
label
ovitz
a
psychopath
totally
incompetent
and
untrustworthy
to
everybody
what
happen
the
love
hate
relationship
grow
out
of

exponentially
as
eisner
and
ovitz
turn
high
level
executive
misunderstand
into
a
new
olympic
event
from
the
start
other
executive
at
disney
saw
ovitz
as
an
out
of
control
locomotive
and
try
to
avoid
be
run
over
eisner

disney
chief
financial
officer
and
general
counsel
sandy

on
the
eve
of
ovitz
start
day
bollenbach
offer
his
congratulation
and
then
shook
ovitz
to
the
core
by
say
and
by
the
way
i
be
not
reporting
to
you
i
be
reporting
to
michael
eisner
litvack
chime
in
with
his
agreement
to
that
surprising
sentiment
ovitz
be
stun
eisner
have
make
it
clear
that
both
of
these
men
would
report
to
him
now
they
have
refuse
and
eisner
be
not
insist
he
be
let
them
rebel
the
explanation
be
simple
both
cherished
their
work
relationship
directly
with
eisner
and
knew
of
ovitz
reputation
for
be
difficult
eisner
clearly
consider
them
too
valuable
to
risk
lose
ovitz
be
seemingly
on
a
steroid
pump
from
the
start
gate
on
his
first
day
at
disney
he
suggest
building
a
private
staircase
to
allow
easy
access
from
his
office
to
eisner
the
stair
building
notion
be
vetoed
by
eisner
ovitz
next
threw
a
meet
and
greet
soiree
to
impress
the
hollywood
community
and
to
flaunt
the
hollywood
muscle
he
would
be
bring
to
the
disney
table
ovitz
defend
the
outrageous
party
cost
as
a
bargain
he
launch
construction
of
a
new
multimillion
dollar
office
for
himself
and
his
staff
accord
to
variety
in
little
over
a
year
he
ran
through
roughly
million
in
random
expense
which
represent
a
fairly
liberal
attitude
toward
petty
cash
outlandish
gift
give
rumor
of
possible
disney
stock
information
told
out
of
school
no
show
to
appointment
and
arrive
late
at
schedule
company
meeting
of
the
top
executive
staff
and
that
be
just
in
the
first
few
week
ovitz
make
internal
disney
enemy
at
an
alarm
rate
one
by
one
all
of
these
new
enemy
report
the
infraction
of
company
policy
and
the
perceive
insult
to
eisner
as
his
best
friend
eisner
go
the
extra
mile
to
watch
ovitz
back
but
that
job
very
quickly
become
an
overbear
task
he
write
later
every
day
be
manage
michael
ovitz
i
do
nothing
else
eisner
thought
he
saw
a
solution
to
his
pain
and
frustration
ovitz
be
involve
in
negotiation
with
sony
and
the
sony
people
be
obviously
impressed
with
him
eisner
try
to
convince
ovitz
that
he
should
offer
himself
to
run
sony
u
s
operation
ovitz
of
course
recognize
this
be
just
a
gambit
to
get
rid
of
him
and
do
not
fall
for
it
at
last
desperately
employ
the
fine
art
of
avoidance
and
delegation
simultaneously
eisner
sent
sanford
litvack
to
inform
ovitz
that
he
be
be
terminate
ovitz
refuse
to
believe
the
hapless
messenger
and
told
him
sandy
you
be
go
to
have
to
pull
me
out
of
here
i
be
not
leave
on
december
in
new
york
for
the
holiday
eisner
hand
a
press
release
to
ovitz
it
announce
ovitz
departure
from
disney
by
mutual
consent
in
the
original
contract
term
eisner
have
recognize
that
ovitz
would
be
walk
away
from
that
million
annual
income
he
would
receive
from
his
agency
business
and
have
include
a
what
if
provision
in
case
the
job
at
disney
do
not
work
out
no
one
ever
expect
the
provision
to
be
of
consequence
but
now
it
be
it
provide
that
if
ovitz
left
disney
except
if
be
terminate
for
cause
fraud
embezzlement
or
the
like
ovitz
would
be
entitle
to
a
severance
payment
of
million
that
be
a
vast
sum
of
money
especially
when
paid
for
not
work
but
that
be
the
agreement
and
disney
paid
up
these
former
best
friend
never
dream
that
the
gory
detail
of
their
business
fracas
would
end
up
in
lengthy
tell
all
session
document
in
thousand
of
page
of
a
court
reporter
transcript
of
a
trial
held
in
in
a
delaware
courtroom
mile
from
tinseltown
in
steve
own
phrase
have
hand
apple
to
a
bozo
once
before
now
that
he
be
back
he
be
determine
to
make
his
presence
felt
and
rescue
the
company
from
the
brink
of
disaster
where
it
have
be
teeter
look
back
year
later
he
would
describe
his
life
view
not
in
business
term
but
as
a
creator
the
vision
he
want
to
hold
of
himself
one
of
my
role
model
be
bob
dylan
as
i
grow
up
i
learn
the
lyric
to
all
his
song
and
watch
him
never
stand
still
if
you
look
at
the
artist
if
they
get
really
good
it
always
occurs
to
them
at
some
point
that
they
can
do
this
one
thing
for
the
rest
of
their
life
and
they
can
be
really
successful
to
the
outside
world
but
the
young
man
as
artist
be
always
in
some
way
at
war
with
the
young
man
inside
the
moment
of
recognize
that
he
can
be
successful
be
also
the
moment
that
an
artist
really
decides
who
he
or
she
be
if
they
keep
on
risk
failure
they
be
still
artist
dylan
and
picasso
be
always
risk
failure
that
lesson
be
now
root
deep
within
steve
the
apple
thing
be
that
way
for
me
i
do
not
want
to
fail
of
course
but
even
though
i
do
not
know
how
bad
thing
really
be
i
still
have
a
lot
to
think
about
before
i
say
yes
to
become
part
of
apple
again
even
only
as
a
special
adviser
i
have
to
consider
the
implication
for
my
family
for
my
reputation
i
decide
that
i
do
not
really
care
because
this
be
what
i
want
to
do
if
i
try
my
best
and
fail
well
i
try
my
best
from
a
young
age
steve
have
recognize
his
own
uncanny
flair
for
computer
design
whenever
he
look
at
other
people
computer
he
saw
clunky
square
box
with
unappealing
color
and
massive
monitor
driven
to
break
away
from
those
boring
distress
styleless
shape
steve
have
make
the
apple
ii
a
wedge
with
the
box
mold
out
of
high
quality
plastic
and
distinctive
the
macintosh
be
the
next
product
stamp
with
his
indelible
sense
of
design
an
amalgam
of
cool
surprise
elegance
and
wit
ditto
for
the
next
cube
they
might
not
have
be
as
functional
as
they
should
have
be
they
might
have
be
aggressively
nonconformist
but
they
always
have
a
distinctive
spectacular
look
we
do
not
have
a
way
to
talk
about
this
kind
of
thing
steve
say
in
most
people
vocabulary
design
mean
veneer
it
be
interior
decorate
it
be
the
fabric
of
the
curtain
and
the
sofa
but
to
me
nothing
could
be
far
from
the
meaning
of
design
design
be
the
fundamental
soul
of
a
man
make
creation
that
end
up
express
itself
in
successive
outer
layer
of
the
product
or
service
still
it
be
vastly
more
than
design
that
he
sense
lack
at
the
apple
he
have
return
to
the
fire
have
go
out
it
be
much
bad
than
i
could
imagine
the
people
have
be
told
they
be
loser
for
so
long
they
be
on
the
verge
of
give
up
the
first
six
month
be
very
bleak
and
at
time
i
get
close
to
throw
in
the
towel
too
through
various
ceo
apple
have
attempt
an
on

of

where
one
sale
could
mean
hundred
or
even
thousand
of
product
apple
could
not
compete
when
the
bottom
line
be
price

performance
and
when
style
be
irrelevant
as
it
be
in
the
standard
office
market
apple
could
sell
when
a
consumer
be
willing
to
pay
a
bit
more
to
be
different
to
look
cool
to
feel
the
thrill
of
belonging

in
the
summer
of
that

sale
have
fall
to

and
loss
be
over
billion
it
be
just
the
opening
steve
have
be
wait
for
so
many
time
in
the
past
he
have
coldly
refuse
to
show
loyalty
to
his
closest
friend
why
should
he
now
show
any
loyalty
to
gil
amelio
merely
because
gil
have
brought
him
back
into
the
company
he
love
steve
job
have
maintain
an
arm
length
relationship
with
most
reporter
basically
he
seem
to
mistrust
anyone
who
us
word
for
a
living
an
attitude
that
be
shape
in
the
crucible
of
experience
yes
the
press
have
often
be
extremely
laudatory
it
be
the
medium
that
make
steve
into
the
rock
star
of
high
tech
but
the
press
have
be
painfully
unkind
as
well
it
be
easy
to
say
that
this
be
the
price
of
be
a
public
figure
just
because
the
statement
carry
a
great
deal
of
truth
do
not
make
it
any
less
difficult
to
bear
the
sting
word
so
steve
respond
by
give
interview
and
story
only
on
his
own
term
and
even
walk
out
of
an
interview
or
a
tv
appearance
when
his
ground
rule
be
broken
a
few
reporter
though
a
very
few
earn
steve
trust
and
respect
and
one
of
these
be
brent
schlender
of
fortune
who
have
built
his
success
in
part
on
be
able
to
form
strong

with
industry
leader
such
as
john
chamber
michael
dell
bill
gate
and
andy
grove
gil
amelio
never
form
the
degree
of
connection
with
schlender
that
steve
job
have
when
schlender
write
a
major
story
on
apple
for
the
february
issue
of
fortune
he
do
not
see
gil
success
in
cleaning
up
past
mistake
write
off
unsalable
inventory
and
arrange
loan
to
keep
the
company
operating
necessary
step
on
the
rocky
road
to
recovery
what
schlender
focus
on
be
the
problem
the
title
alone
told
the
story
something
rotten
in
cupertino
the
article
be
more
than
a
litany
of
complaint
against
gil
and
his
management
style
schlender
told
fortune
reader
that
there
be
salvation
for
apple
steve
job
be
wait
in
the
wing
steve
could
not
have
ask
for
well
ammunition
the
article
laid
the
groundwork
steve
knew
how
to
make
the
most
of
the
opportunity
an
ailment
that
might
be
call
board
of
director
impatience
also
come
into
play
ellen
hancock
gil
chief
technology
officer
who
now
serf
on
the
board
of
major
company
such
as
colgate
palmolive
and
ed
find
that
board
of
troubled
company
have
a
tendency
not
to
give
the
ceo
enough
time
to
solve
the
problem
even
when
most
sign
point
to
the
company
be
on
its
way
back
to
good
health
the
board
may
be
impatient
and
turn
out
the
ceo
both
of
these
factor
probably
help
fan
the
flame
the
arsonist
in
the
case
though
be
steve
himself
and
the
kindle
he
use
be
board
member
ed
woolard
who
be
then
the
chairman
of
dupont
and
have
earlier
serve
on
the
board
of
ibm
that
gil
have
personally
recruit
woolard
to
the
apple
board
make
little
difference
now
accord
to
a
source
close
to
the
situation
steve
go
to
work
on
ed
woolard
and
convince
him
to
lead
a
revolt
which
he
do
he
convince
a
majority
of
the
board
that
they
be
all
go
to
be
sue
if
they
do
not
make
the
change
apparently
the
damocles
sword
of
a
lawsuit
be
not
an
idle
threat
the
same
source
believe
that
steve
have
already
obtain
an
agreement
from
his
billionaire
friend
larry
ellison
to
sue
the
board
and
its
member
if
they
do
not
turn
gil
out
ellison
drop
hint
to
a
reporter
that
he
be
consider
a
hostile
takeover
bid
for
apple
the
strategy
and
woolard

and
del
lewis
held

for

to
cast
their

a
lot
to

the
company
but
the
sale

not
rebound
we
think
you
need
to
step
down
gil
sense
that
a
discussion
be
futile
but
point
out
that
the
company
have
just
finish
a
quarter
with
result
that
be
well
than
the
analyst
prediction
he
ask
you
want
me
to
step
down
just
when
thing
be
begin
to
look
well
woolard
answer
we
want
to
find
a
ceo
who
can
be
a
great
marketing
and
sale
leader
for
the
company
but
of
course
they
have
already
found
him
the
description
be
tailor
make
to
fit
steve
job
steve
be
the
first
person
who
call
when
gil
return
from
his
july
fourth
holiday
be
he
offering
condolence
or
gloat
gil
be
never
sure
when
gil
have
take
the
job
as
apple
ceo
he
told
the
board
that
he
would
need
three
year
to
bring
the
company
back
to
health
now
the
board
have
fire
him
after
a
year
and
a
half
gil
later
regret
that
he
have
not
put
a
three
year
no
fire
clause
into
the
term
of
his
contract
many
people
inside
the
company
and
out
be
glad
to
see
gil
leave
apple
some
in
the
press
deride
the
national
best
seller
on
the
fire
line
that
he
write
about
his
apple
experience
attack
it
as
represent
only
gil
own
point
of
view
as
if
any
autobiography
could
be
expect
to
do
anything
else
few
people
seem
to
take
note
of
the
most
significant
fact
of
gil
amelio
reign
at
apple
when
he
take
over
the
company
have
enough
money
in
the
bank
to
survive
for
three
month
when
he
depart
he
left
a
legacy
of
billion
dollar
in
cash
a
bankroll
that
allow
steve
to
keep
the
company
in
business
while
he
tinker
now
apply
his
own
loyalty
principle
in
the
opposite
direction
steve
apparently
recognize
how
his
gigantic
disloyalty
have
damage
the
reputation
and
the
stature
of
the
very
man
who
have
rescue
next
from
oblivion
make
steve
wealthy
again
and
give
him
the
foothold
within
apple
that
have
allow
him
the
platform
to
position
himself
for
the
takeover
recognize
how
disloyal
he
have
be
toward
gil
steve
become
cool
and
distant
as
if
afraid
that
gil
own
sense
of
loyalty
would
make
him
vengeful
sometimes
steve
could
show
an
uncanny
reading
of
other
people
sometimes
he
could
be
blind
deep
down
even
from
the
very
begin
steve
have
felt
certain
that
he
could
run
apple
as
the
company
ceo
no
one
could
argue
that
he
have
no
claim
to
justify
the
desire
he
have
be
the
drive
force
that
get
the
company
start
steve
wozniak
have
be
essential
but
he
be
no
entrepreneur
finally
thirteen
year
after
be
summarily
thrown
out
of
his
own
company
steve
job
be
back
and
not
just
back
but
with
a
vengeance
as
chief
executive
his
first
suggestion
be
to
re
price
stock
option
so
that
staff
morale
would
improve
his
second
to
make
everyone
in
the
company
work
to
a
bonus
that
be
stock
related
so
the
whole
crew
would
pull
together
one
of
steve
first
call
be
to
bill
gate
who
have
be
negotiate
with
gil
for
month
only
an
alliance
with
the
most
important
company
in
the
technology
world
could
quickly
shore
up
apple
fortune
steve
knew
just
what
gate
and
microsoft
want
an
agreement
that
would
allow
microsoft
to
design
a
user
interface
like
apple
the
very
item
gate
have
be
harass
gil
about
for
eighteen
month
that
gil
recognize
would
be
a
giveaway
and
would
deprive
apple
of
its
most
significant
differentiation
from
the
clumsy
microsoft
operating
system
steve
sign
away
apple
most
precious
intellectual
property
without
blinking
so
that
he
would
be
able

no

he

there

do
apple

your
side

yank
your
leash
whenever
she
want
you
to
stop

these
new
edict
be
laid
on
top
of
the
aura
of
fear
steve
carry
with
him
like
a
dark
cloud
you
do
not
want
to
be
call
in
front
of
him
to
do
a
product
presentation
because
he
might
decide
to
lop
off
the
product
and
you
with
it
you
do
not
want
to
encounter
him
in
a
hallway
because
he
might
not
like
an
answer
you
give
and
would
say
something
so
demean
that
it
could
undermine
your
confidence
for
week
and
you
sure
as
hell
do
not
want
to
get
trap
on
an
elevator
with
him
because
by
the
time
the
door
open
you
might
not
have
a
job
some
apple
ites
take
to
walk
the
stair
to
avoid
the
possibility
of
an
elevator
encounter
it
would
be
easy
to
call
this
a
reign
of
terror
but
the
fact
be
that
the
company
begin
to
turn
around
steve
two
most
trust
technologist
from
next
be

spare
and
stun
with
a
simple
message
of
think
different

up
everywhere
even

on
the
side
of
building
announce
a
fresh
start
for
the
company
they
boost
employee
morale
it
do
not
matter
that
the
phrase
be
gratingly
ungrammatical
maybe
that
be
even
part
of
its
charm
steve
be
back
he
seem
to
know
what
be
go
on
in
every
corner
of
the
company
he
be
get
apple
back
on
track
five
month
after
his
coup
steve
appear
at
the
january
macworld
in
san
francisco
to
give
his
traditional
lengthy
but
absorb
keynote
speech
at
the
very
end
pretend
he
be
finish
but
then
return
to
the
microphone
he
add
as
if
just
a
footnote
i
almost
forgot
we
be
profitable
the
macworld
audience
have
never
adore
steve
more
than
they
adore
him
at
this
triumphal
moment
back
only
month
and
already
he
have
make
their
beloved
apple
profitable
again
in
truth
of
course
no
one
turn
a
giant
company
around
in
half
a
year
almost
all
of
the
credit
for
the
recovery
belong
to
gil
amelio
but
he
would
get
none
of
the
praise
not
from
this
audience
and
not
from
the
press
he
be
already
forgotten
his
accomplishment
in
rescue
the
company
would
be
bury
deep
cover
over
and
ignore
steve
be
once
again
basking
in
someone
else
sunshine
these
day
steve
show
no
embarrassment
for
his
double
deal
with
gil
but
then
steve
have
never
be
famous
for
show
warmth
even
to
his
close
friend
a
gamble
man
would
have
be
driven
mad
by
the
sign
and
the
countersign
point
in
opposite
direction
about
how
toy
story
would
fare
with
audience
michael
ovitz
be
bad
mouth
the
picture
all
around
town
and
to
every
disney

who
would
listen
predict
disastrous
box
office
on
the
other
hand
it
have
be
a
pet
project
of
jeffrey
katzenberg
and
katzenberg
be
in
disgrace
at
disney
so
to
many
people
ovitz
dire
prediction
sound
bias

petty
then
a
near
final
version
of
the

be
run
for
a
random
sneakpreview
audience
and
the
reaction
start
a
small
panic
maybe
ovitz
be
right
after
all
while
the
viewer
have
warm
to
the

come
to

despite
his
still
painful
animosity
toward

along
with
the
rest

alvy
get
a
full

kept
very
much
in

easy
to
ridicule
steve

at
that

he
become
what
he
have
always
imagine
for
himself
what

mogul
i
think
pixar
have
the
opportunity
to
be
the

disney
not
replace

be
the
next
disney
steve

n
the
late
fall
of
as
the
pixar
ipo
approach
steve
have
once
again
help
to
set
a
pattern
even
though
he
could
not
have
know
it
at
the
time
pixar
be
about
to
become
part
of
the
initial
wave
that
would
turn
into
a
flood
of
speculative
invest
that
we
now
look
back
on
in
most
case
with
regret
as
the
dot
com
boom
when
steve
have
first
go
knock
on
door
look
for
an
investment
firm
to
lead
his
ipo
the
banker
all
but
laugh
in
his
face
investor
only
want
company
that
be
make
money
he
be
told
you
first
have
to
show
a
record
of
successful
profit
make
year
and
stable
management
all
very
sensible
the
accepted
wisdom
of
every
reputable
investment
banker
except
that
just
a
few
month
earlier
a
company
call
netscape
communication
have
manage
to
break
the
rule
in
one
of
those
small
world
coincidence
that
seem
to
occur
with
unaccountable
frequency
the
company
founder
jim
clark
have
work
briefly
for
alvy
ray
smith
and
ed
catmull
as
part
of
the
original
pre
pixar
computer
graphic
team
on
long
island
netscape
have
be
in
business
for
a
year
offering
a
software
product
that
allow
people
to
connect
to
the
still
not
much
understood
universe
of
the
internet
it
have
never
show
a
profit
yet
in
that
overheat
environment
somehow
the
business
press
saw
a
unique
potential
writer
vied
with
one
another
to
describe
an
ever
brighter
potential
future
for
the
company
which
cause
a
clamor
for
the
stock
trading
open
at
and
by
the
time
the
exchange
close
at
the
end
of
the
first
day
the
price
have
double
jim
clark
hold
be
worth
half
a
billion
dollar
number
like
those
cause
some
of
the
more
aggressive
investment
banker
to
see
an
opportunity
steve
instinct
lead
him
to
shift
his
focus
instead
of
go
with
one
of
the
prestigious
big
name
new
york
city
firm
ever
the
hand
on
manager
he
decide
to
work
with
a
local
outfit
that
would
allow
him
to
keep
a
close
eye
on
the
progress
he
ask
around
and
chose
the
san
francisco
base
robertson
stephen
which
describes
itself
as
a
boutique
investment
firm
the
success
of
this
ipo
could
shape
steve
whole
future
he
do
not
want
to
make
a
bad
choice
so
he
talk
to
some
institutional
investor
ask
them
whether
they
would
be
wary
of
become
involve
in
the
ipo
if
the
lead
firm
be
robertson
stephen
instead
of
say
goldman
sachs
co
he
be
reassure
all
of
them
say
the
west
coast
guy
would
be
as
good
and
half
prefer
it
because
the
california
firm
treat
them
well
he
say
robertson
stephen
be
delighted
to
get
the
business
with
company
chairman
sanford
robertson
note
that
the
new
york
firm
have
always
come
in
and
just
skim
the
cream
off
the
top
take
only
the
very
best
offering
not
this
time
steve
make
their
work
easy
in
no
small
part
because
of
his
instinct
about
the
timing
by
schedule
the
ipo
just
a
week
after
the
toy
story
opening
steve
would
not
have
to
rely
on
the
usual
dog
and
pony
show
in
which
the
executive
of
the
company
travel
to
major
city
across
the
united
state
in
hope
of
convincing
local
stockbroker
and
investment
firm
to
talk
up
the
company
to
their
customer
instead
he
would
be
rid
on
the
coattail
of
the
massive
disney
publicity
campaign
every
investor
in
the
country
would
be
bombard
with
the
pixar
name
just
at
the
opportune
moment
the
ipo
take
place
on
the
last
tuesday
of
november
one
week
to
the
day
after
the
toy
story
opening
in
the
early
hour
of
the
morning
a
select
few
of
the
top

show
up
at
the

have
argue
for
the

steve
knew
that

once
the

put

arrangement
with

so
that
if
toy
story
prove
to

the

of

in
make
arrangement
for
the

steve
learn
that
the
participation
deal
would
not
fly
investor
do
not
accept
the
idea
that
employee
be
dip
into
profit
that
should
go
to
stockholder
steve
be
burn
up
at
the
idea
but
he
have
to
find
something
that
would
induce
the
four
to
waive
their
profit
participation
the
bad
part
be
that
he
do
not
have
much
of
a
negotiate
position
he
have
to
get
their
agreement
when
the
deal
be
finally
work
out
steve
with
thirty
million
share
still
own
a
whop
percent
of
the
company
stock
but
he
have
be
force
to
give
up
control
over
a
good
many
more
share
than
he
have
want
to
john
lasseter
alone
be
worth
million
at
the
end
of
that
first
day
still
the
four
suffer
from
conflict
emotion
steve
have
be
less
than
generous
with
the
rest
of
the
company
and
there
be
long
face
accompany
by
plenty
of
grouse
in
the
hallway
a
few
people
be
suddenly
unaccountably
rich
and
everyone
else
even
people
who
have
be
with
the
company
for
year
felt
left
out
in
the
cold
steve
have
be
criticize
harshly
for
be
tight
fisted
about
this
when
he
could
so
easily
have
show
appreciation
for
his
employee
loyalty
and
incredibly
long
hour
one
former
executive
who
have
left
well
before
anyone
start
talk
about
an
ipo
disagreed
steve
be
write
check
out
of
his
personal
checkbook
to
keep
everybody
employ
so
it
seem
to
me
a
little
shallow
for
employee
to
say
i
do
not
get
my
share
i
do
not
know
that
anybody
be
lead
to
believe
they
be
go
to
get
more
stock
than
they
do
as
with
any
other
company
he
say
you
knew
when
you
be
hire
whether
you
be
get
any
option
how
many
and
when
they
would
vest
it
be
all
spell
out
in
write
in
your
employment
agreement
he
say
we
live
in
a
world
where
everybody
say
it
be
unfairsomebody
gotten
more
than
me
sure
some
other
ceo
might
have
be
more
generous
but
as
this
ex
executive
point
out
steve
have
be
pour
money
into
pixar
every
month
even
long
after
there
have
seem
any
hope
of
ever
recover
his
investment
on
two
different
occasion
fortune
company
have
step
up
checkbook
in
hand
offering
to
buy
pixar
neither
offer
as
much
as
steve
have
already
invest
he
can
be
painfully
stubborn
so
stubborn
that
he
will
go
against
his
own
best
interest
a
more
reasonable
man
would
have
cut
his
loss
be
glad
to
get
what
he
could
and
gotten
out
while
he
still
have
some
money
left
both
time
steve
have
refuse
now
his
stubbornness
have
paid
off
he
gamble
the
former

say
he
put
or

off
some
of
those
employee
have
option
worth
in
the
hundred
of
thousand
of
dollar
can
you
really
blame
steve
if
he
do
not
feel
like
give
them
more
stock
than
they
have

on

and
who
be
this
young
man

hollywood
outsider
this
novice
in
the
movie
business
in
which
eisner
have
work
all
his
year
who
seem
to
want
to
be
treat
as
an
equal
steve
job
held
the
upper
hand
he
own
the
rough
cut
but
brilliant
diamond
call
john
lasseter
eisner
knew
what
a
treasure
that
be
bar
some
catastrophe
john
talent
would
only
grow
and
the
movie
he
would
create
would
bring
in
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
billion
even
job
and
eisner
though
from
very
different
world
be
remarkably
alike
both
scrap
their
way
to
the
top
of
the
heap
both
be
bless
with
great
intelligence
and
unusual
insight
both
have
an
instinct
for
business
and
for
handle
people
that
border
on
the
extraordinary
both
value
loyalty
as
one
of
the
most
treasure
character
trait
of
the
people
around
them
both
have
on
occasion
be
incredibly
vindictive
to
people
they
felt
have
proven
themselves
unworthy
of
continued
trust
both
be
capable
of
ruthlessly
cut
off
a
long
term
associate
whom
they
decide
have
proven
himself
or
herself
unworthy
once
when
one
of
his
executive
come
in
to
tell
eisner
that
he
be
leave
to
take
another
position
the
disney
ceo
say
i
will
never
speak
to
you
again
he
be
not
kid
encounter
the
man
in
a
restaurant
eisner
look
right
through
him
as
if
he
be
invisible
of
course
it
do
not
help
that
the
executive
have
be
recruit
by
archenemy
katzenberg
now
embolden
by
the
success
of
toy
story
steve
laid
three
demand
on
the
table
first
pixar
be
to
have
sole
creative
control
over
the
movie
it
produce
for
disney
no
more
run
to
burbank
for
review
of
concept
character
story
scene
and
petty
detail
the
next
point
turn
on
steve
vision
of
the
pixar
name
as
a
brand
that
could
support
the
sale
of
a
wide
range
of
consumer
item
similar
to
the
disney
retail
store
and
disney
be
sell
consumer
product
to
the
tune
of
some
billion
a
year
imagine
if
pixar
could
do
even
half
of
that
a
third
of
it
more
money
than
they
would
ever
make
from
movie
ticket
sale
so
steve
second
point
be
a
stab
at
make
the
public
more
conscious
of
the
pixar
brand
he
insist
that
on
all
movie
dvd
package
fast
food
chain
tie
in
toy
and
other
product
the
pixar
logo
be
the
same
size
as
the
disney
logo
this
may
seem
like
a
small
item
how
often
be
any
of
us
consciously
aware
of
the
branding
on
a
toy
a
game
or
a
taco
wrapper
but
with
million
upon
million
of
exposure
per
year
the
name
begin
to
sear
itself
into
the
public
consciousness
steve
with
his
innate
business
acumen
have
look
into
the
distant
future
and
saw
billion
of
dollar
flow
into
pixar
from
a
side
business
if
those
first
two
demand
be
difficult
for
eisner
the
third
be
a
stunner
steve
want
all
revenue
from
pixar
movie
to
be
share
fifty
fifty
between
disney
and
pixar
steve
job
and
michael
eisner
be
both
capable
of
give
way
to
anger
both
be
master
negotiator
who
know
how
to
spot
the
other
guy
weakness
and
take
advantage
of
them
the
entire
culture
of
the
walt
disney
company
be
found
on
the
notion
that
if
you
want
to
do
business
with
disney
you
be
agree
to
do
thing
the
disney
way
with
no
discussion
about
what
be
fair
yet
michael
eisner
capitulate
one
of
the
most
powerful
men
in
hollywood
give
in
not
because
of
steve
job
and
his
bargaining
power
but
because
of
john
lasseter
take
a
small
share
of
the
pixar
revenue
would
be
well
than
piss
off
steve
and
have
him
run
out
his
contract
and
then
go
find
another
studio
to
distribute
his
movie
the
hat
jeffrey
katzenberg
would
surely
offer
a
tempt
deal
to
get
pixar
away
from
michael
eisner
that
be
too
painful
a
possibility
for
eisner
to
contemplate
the
new
contract
cover
seven
film
in
total
toy
story
toy
story
a
bug
life
and
four
more
film
to
be
determine
disney
would
still
control
the
right
to
make
sequel
but
pixar
would
start
to
participate
in
the
merchandising
money
in
an
industry
where
many
a
list
producer
settle
for
a
meager
percent
share
of
box
office
revenue
steve
would
get
percent
onetime
pixar
marketing
executive
and
close
steve
job
associate
pam
kerwin
say
that
steve
enable
us
to
negotiate
as
equal
she
credit
this
bargaining
triumph
to
steve
brain
energy
and
chutzpah
even
before
the
toy
story
premiere
animator
who
finish
work
on
their
part
of
the
project
have
be
pull
off
and
set
to
work
on
the
initial
phase
for
the
sequel
toy
story
it
seem
curious
now
look
back
but
this
be
plan
to
be
a
direct
to
video
production
a
decision
govern
strictly
by
financial
motif
that
rubbed
against
the
culture
of
pixar
ed
catmull
explains
toy
story
be
the
define
moment
for
the
studio
we
have
start
off
make
the
movie
for
video
instead
of
theatrical
release
but
realize
halfway
into
it
that
we
would
create
a
two
tier
studio
and
that
he
acknowledge
be
not
good
for
our
soul
nine
month
before
it
be
to
be
deliver
we
basically
threw
it
away
we
redid
the
whole
movie
even
though
we
be
told
it
be
too
late
but
we
do
it
anyway
because
it
be
not
good
enough
because
of
the
intense
time
pressure
we
have
people
who
have
repetitive
stress
injury
one
permanently
after
that
i
thought
to
myself
we
ca
not
run
a
company
this
way
instead
pixar
shift
gear
and
move
up
the
next

by

time
jeffrey
katzenberg
be
well
ensconce
at
dreamworks
where
he
be
fiercely
determine
to
establish
an
animation
kingdom
that
would
clearly
outshine
not
just
pixar
but
disney
in
particular
a
disney
executive
who
have
work
closely
with
katzenberg
say
the
first
thing
you
need
to
know
about
jeffrey
be
that
he
know
very
little
about
anything
he
be
a
quick
learner
and
he
be
learn
a
lot
about
motion
picture
from
experience
but
he
do
not
seem
to
be
in
touch
with
a
broad
range
of
knowledge
it
always
amaze
me
that
he
would
approach
subject
so
naively
he
be
a
man
of
enormous
self
esteem
this
executive
say
and
one
of
the
people
i
least
understood
in
life
in
meeting
with
the
top
disney
people
katzenberg
would
say
thing
like
if
the
people
in
this
room
ran
general
motor
think
how
much
well
it
would
be
the
statement
be
so
outlandish
that
they
would
drive
eisner
slightly
crazy
and
he
would
say
something
like
jeffrey
please
john
lasseter
felt
that
he
have
developed
a
friendship
with
katzenberg
remember
how
jeffrey
have
champion
toy
story
he
be
the
one
who
have
believe
in
us
when
we
want
to
be
up
here
near
san
francisco
make
movie
for
disney
lasseter
recall
so
lasseter
want
to
keep
in
touch
after
katzenberg
left
disney
for
dreamworks
at
one
point
in
the
fall
of
when
john
be
in
the
early
stage
of
think
about
a
bug
life
he
and
screenwriter
andrew
stanton
drop
in
on
jeffrey
and
regale
him
with
some
of
the
story
idea
we
told
him
all
about
bug
say
lasseter
jeffrey
prove
to
be
an
enthusiastic
listener
encourage
john
with
question
and
draw
him
out
he
ask
about
the
release
date
john
told
him
the
picture
be
schedule
to
be
another
holiday
release
to
open
just
before
thanksgiving
john
lasseter
conversation
be
to
say
the
least
ill
advise
it
be
not
that
jeffrey
do
not
return
john
feeling
of
friendship
he
probably
do
view
john
as
a
friend
but
there
be
another
strong
element
at
work
that
john
could
not
have
be
aware
of
accord
to
the
exdisney
executive
michael
eisner
have
taught
jeffrey
katzenberg
the
daunt
power
of
information
and
jeffrey
have
learn
the
lesson
well
information
eisner
believe
be
a
weapon
to
discover
opportunity
and
identify
weakness
in
what
your
competitor
be
do
and
then
use
the
knowledge
to
beat
the
competition
at
its
own
game
once
eisner
sat
in
on
a
weekly
meeting
of
the
disney
sunday
movie
team
a
public
relation
staffer
related
that
she
have
a
friend
an
executive
at
another
studio
who
have
mention
that
he
be
work
on
a
similar
project
eisner
ask
her
a
question
about
the
other
project
the
woman
say
that
her
friend
have
not
share
that
information
eisner
look
at
her
and
say
have
you
slept
with
him
yet
he
told
her
i
do
not
care
how
you
do
it
you
have
get
to
get
that
information
the
woman
do
not
seem
offend
by
eisner
admonition
but
the
moment
underscored
his
attitude
that
information
be
king
on
another
occasion
eisner
generate
gale
of
laughter
from
a
group
of
his
executive
with
a
tale
of
how
he
and
a
colleague
have
once
climbed
over
the
fence
onto
the
universal
lot
to
do
some
scout
they
be
spot
and
chase
by
guard
dog
narrowly
escape
back
over
the
fence
in
the
nick
of
time
these
two
story
each
from
the
source
who
heard
it
firsthand
illustrate
the
ruthless
thirst
for
information
that
jeffrey
katzenberg
have
learn
at
michael
eisner
knee
so
to
katzenberg
what
he
do
after
pump
lasseter
about
a
bug
life
be
not
violate
a
friendship
it
be
simply
do
business
for
a
few
year
an
idea
have
be
bounce
around
hollywood
for
an
animate
film
that
would
be
a
twist
on
aesop
fable
about
the
ant
and
the
grasshopper
not
long
after
the
john
lasseter
visit
dreamworks
purchase
a
percent
interest
in
pacific
data
image
pdi
a
pioneer
animation
house
in
san
francisco
that
be
struggle
the
story
come
out
later
that
katzenberg
told
pdi
he
would
do
a
deal
with
them
that
would
include
an
infusion
of
cash
and
a
contract
to
produce
an
animate
film
only
on
condition
that
they
could
complete
the
film
and
get
it
into
release
before
a
bug
life
come
out
the
pdi
film
be
to
be
developed
from
the
ant
and
grasshopper
idea
katzenberg
be
undercut
his
friend
lasseter
by
pit
one
insect
film
against
another
and
make
sure
that
his
would
be
the
first
to
reach
theater
screen
an
industry
executive
who
work
with
katzenberg
over
a
number
of
year
do
not
see
anything
particularly
unexpected
or
even
malicious
in
this
behavior
jeffrey
be
very
strategic
about
those
kind
of
thing
the
executive
say
he
could
look
at
two
compete
project
with
the
same
idea
and
he
would
absolutely
religiously
not
be
willing
to
be
the
second
one
to
enter
the
marketplace
he
would
make
that
strategy
perfectly
clear
to
everybody
work
on
his
project
it
be
absolutely
essential
to
us
in
do
this
film
that
we
be
first
and
that
be
the
case
with
antz
his
decision
to
make
antz
be
that
he
would
make
it
only
if
he
could
make
it
before
bug
life
that
kind
of
strategic
think
be
one
of
the
thing
jeffrey
be
very
good
at
the
executive
add
he
probably
have
a
history
of
sour
relationship
from
how
he
have
played
this
game
this
time
around

his
beat

that

a
personal

up

the
phenomenally
generous
gift
of
the
airplane
as
a
fundamental
change
in
steve
attitude
it
be
say
that
he
move
from
the
unassuming
small
office
he
have
chosen
for
himself
to
the
ceo
suite
with
a
view
of
the
mountain
that
gil
amelio
have
use
and
that
he
resume
his
practice
of
parking
in
a
handicapped
parking

that
in

he
again

be

i
think
pixar
have
the
opportunity

disney
a
few
year
earlier
it
would
have
sound
like
more
stevian
smoke
and
mirror
yet
perhaps
the
next
disney
be
too
modest
the
medium
would
soon
report
that
pixar
break
through
billion
in
earnings
have
become
the
most
successful
hollywood
studio
of
all
time
steve
job
have
stamp
his
mark
on
two
of
the
world
most
prominent
industry
and
he
be
not
do
yet

break
new
ground
apple
be
a
team
sport
steve
job
asting
about
for
a
new
role
that
would
set
apple
apart
steve
come
to
see
that
get
an
internet
angle
for
the
macintosh
need
to
be
a
top
priority
as
he
survey
the
ruin
of
apple
he
realize
that
he
have
to
catch
the
internet
wave
among
consumer
since
the
begin
apple
have
tout
its
ease
of
use
it
be
not
much
of
a
leap
to
combine
that
ease
of
use
with
the
internet
the
company
have
to
deliver
a
new
kind
of
consumer
computer
he
envision
a
product
that
would
catch
the
current
of
public
interest
and
captivate
people
with
radical
design
computer
be
still
awful
he
grouse
they
be
too
complicate
and
do
not
do
what
you
really
want
them
to
do
or
do
those
thing
as
well
as
they
could
we
have
a
long
way
to
go
people
be
still
make
automobile
after
nearly
year
telephone
have
be
around
a
long
time
but
even
so
the
cellular
revolution
be
pretty
excite
steve
do
not
see
enough
innovation
in
his
industry
my
purpose
in
come
back
to
apple
be
that
our
industry
be
in
a
coma
it
remind
me
of
detroit
in
the
s
when
american
car
be
boat
on
wheel
he
be
absolutely
sure
that
apple
have
a
good
chance
to
be
a
serious
player
again
if
only
he
could
graft
the
ease
of
use
and
the
elegance
of
the
macintosh
to
the
freedom
of
the
internet
steve
take
up
gil
amelio
drive
to
fix
the
waste
in
development
neglect
to
mention
that
the
effort
be
not
one
that
he
himself
have
start
we
have
review
the
road
map
of
new
product
and
axed
more
than
percent
of
them
he
say
keep
the
percent
that
be
gem
in
fact
amelio
have
laid
out
a
plan
to
cut
percent
of
the
development
project
and
be
already
well
along
with
cleaning
the
house
when
steve
take
over
an
all
out
program
to
create
a
new
low
end
consumer
mac
be
another
effort
steve
also
take
credit
for
explain
that
we
have
a
lot
of
customer
and
we
have
a
lot
of
research
into
our
instal
base
we
also
watch
industry
trend
pretty
carefully
but
in
the
end
for
something
this
complicate
it
be
really
hard
to
design
product
by
focus
group
a
lot
of
time
people
do
not
know
what
they
want
until
you
show
it
to
them
another
whopper
of
reality
distortion
together
with
ellen
hancock
gil
have
launch
a
low
end
computer
project
early
in
his
reign
and
the
product
be
within
three
or
four
month
of
be
finish
when
steve
take
over
amelio
say
steve
give
it
the
name
imac
and
take
all
the
credit
one
engineering
executive
of
amelio
regime
say
most
of
the
product
that
come
out
in
the
first
three
year
after
steve
take
over
be
start
under
gil
it
be
the
old
steve
but
with
a
fair
number
of
his
good
idea
from
the
early
day
still
intact
he
be
go
to
trust
his
instinct
drive
a
small
group
to
outdo
themselves
and
capture
the
consumer
mindshare
with
panache
style
and
a
handful
of
innovation
not
revolution
the
new
steve
have
be
through
three
different
company
now
in
his
second
term
at
apple
he
understood
some
basic
issue
of
organization
and
high
tech
evangelism
a
crucial
step
be
to
create
singlemarketing
sale
manufacturing
and
finance
group
that
operate
across
the
company
as
a
remedy
for
the
balkanize
duchy
the
war
team
and
the
lack
of
communication
that
have
be
the
norm
since
the
early
day
he
fire
john
sculley
ad
agency
bbdo
and
rehired
chiat
day
the
firm
that
have
create
the
famous
spot
steve
make
developer
a
priority
assign
each
a
single
evangelist
whose
job
it
be
to
handle
all
of
their
need
he
knew
that
stop
the
flight
of
developer
to
window
be
essential
to
the
future
of
the
macintosh
line
one
of
steve
strong
suit
have
always
be
his
operational
management
from
the
day
of
his
high
school
job
at
haltek
to
his
aggressive
bargain
shopping
for
part
for
the
apple
ii
and
on
to
the
mac
he
be
obsess
with
detail
not
just
the
detail
of
design
and
softwareuser
interface
but
the
detail
of
manufacturing
efficiency
so
while
he
be
reshape
apple
on
the
aesthetic
side
he
be
also
revamp
apple
manufacturing
and
inventory
picture
in
the
quarter
after
he
arrive
gil
have
reduce
apple
inventory
down
to
million
nine
month
later
when
the
company
report
fiscal
year
revenue
steve
have
successfully
continued
the
effort
and
the
inventory
be
down
to
million
steve
later
say
that
manage
inventory
be
one
of
the
most
valuable
thing
he
learn
from
gil
in
particular
the
way
gil
have
take
billion
of
inventory
inherit
from
michael
spindler
and
turn
it
into
billion
cash
the
power
of
this
kind
of
discipline
impressed
steve
and
he
embrace
the
lesson
fred
anderson
gil
say
share
the
credit
also
school
steve
on
this
it
be
the
kind
of
hidden
fiscally
conservative
move
that
be
not
usually
associate
with
steve
job
but
it
make
a
big
difference
for
fiscal
apple
sale
fell
to
billion
but
the
company
nonetheless
manage
to
eke
out
a
profit
when
steve
host
the
analyst
call
that
year
he
have
what
he
call
his
schwarzenegger
announcement
play
off
the
famous
line
from
terminator
ii
we
will
be
back
magic
be
start
apple
have
recapture
momentum
and
consumer
buzz
most
of
that
be
on
the
back
of
the
imac
a
little
computer
with
clear
color
plastic
side
panel
that
at
be
also
a
very
shrewd
deal
include
in
the
computer
box
be
a
complete
set
of
the
feature
that
a
consumer
need
to
go
online
the
introduction
of
the
imac
on
may
kept
so
secret
that
few
even
inside
apple
knew
it
be
come
be
classic
steve
showmanship
so
be
the
look
of
the
computer
by
integrate
the
monitor
into
the
same
box
as
all
the
circuit
modem
and
plug
he
have
go
back
to
the
day
of
the
early
macintosh
and
create
a
consumer
compute
appliance
in
one
unit
plug
and
play
have
be
an
old
apple
battle
cry
now
be
reapplied
in
a
new
era
open
the
box
plug
it
in
and
get
surf
this
be
not
so
much
revolutionary
as
evolutionary
every
personal
computer
company
in
the
world
have
be
stuck
in
the
separate
monitor
and
cpu
design
since
the
ibm
pc
have
do
it
in
and
the
apple
ii
even
earlier
the
mac
with
its
toaster
concept
have
try
to
break
out
of
the
mold
in
the
mid
eighty
but
technology
and
component
be
not
advanced
enough
back
then
the
original
machine
be
too
small
in
the
interim
apple
have
lose
its
way
and
introduce
a
series
of
computer
that
fix
the
glare
problem
of
the
original
mac
but
show
no
innovation
in
design
they
have
separate
cpu
and
monitor
and
be
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
rest
of
the
marketplace
the
imac
take
the
best
idea
of
the
macintosh
and
reapplied
it
to
the
new
era
but
it
be
also
just
plain
classic
steve
there
be
no
floppy
disk
in
the
imac
it
include
a
cd
rom
drive
with
a
much
high
capacity
but
there
be
no
way
to
write
file
to
a
disk
and
carry
them
around
in
steve
view
the
way
to
transfer
file
be
over
the
internet
and
through
e
mail
forget
floppy
disk
those
be
from
a
previous
generation
he
be
criticize
mercilessly
for
this
but
this
time
he
have
the
upper
hand
look
you
have
get
to
do
the
right
thing
just
take
the
floppy
people
be
not
think
clearly
nobody
go
to
back
up
a
four
gigabyte
drive
onto
one
megabyte
floppy
they
will
use
a
zip
drive
if
they
want
to
do
it
but
those
be
too
expensive
to
build
into
a
consumer
product
besides
hardly
anybody
back
up
anyway
so
why
build
the
cost
into
every
system
the
second
reason
for
a
floppy
be
software
distribution
but
a
lot
of
software
now
come
on
cd
rom
because
it
be
well
and
cheaper
this
be
the
same
steve
who
thought
he
knew
well
than
the
market
guru
only
this
time
he
really
do
know
well
he
be
percent
right
the
floppy
drive
be
an
anachronism
and
unnecessary
and
the
imac
take
off
in
the
market
without
one
year
earlier
the
marketing
manager
of
the
mac
team
have
described
their
market
research
as
consist
of
steve
look
in
the
mirror
every
morning
and
ask
himself
what
he
want
that
be
still
the
case
but
now
it
be
not
just
steve
he
be
ask
the
rest
of
the
crew
at
apple
to
look
into
the
mirror
too
and
listen
to
them
as
well
the
imac
be
only
one
element
in
an
accelerate
stream
of
product
that
start
to
come
out
of
the
newly
invigorate
company
new
operating
system
upgrade
appear
every
few
month
then
there
be
the
ibook
an
imac
inspire
portable
when
introduce
it
also
offer
airport
a
wireless
networking
option
to
free
the
ibook
from
wire
in
a
home
or
an
office
not
revolutionary
but
an
evolutionary
step
that
many
consumer
appreciate
and
apple
make
the
most
noise
about
it
even
though
dell
compaq
and
other
company
already
offer
it
in
a
little
over
a
year
apple
sell
over
two
million
imacs
and
the
momentum
accelerate
it
be
enough
to
launch
the
company
into
a
string
of
profitable
quarter
a
few
of
the
initiative
do
not
pan
out
in
steve
determine
to
buy
the
palm
pilot
line
from
com
as
a
way
of
offering
a
handheld
product
without
have

to
start

reflect
the

brought
the
reward
thing
be
not
merely
to
start
a
company
or
to
take
it
public
it

like
when

a
miracle
what
truly
reward

that
too
many
people

with

that
be
somewhat
understandable
because
there
be
many
moment
fill
with
despair
and
agony
when
you
have
to
fire
people
and
cancel

and
deal
with
very
difficult
situation
that

when

what
your
value
be
steve
have
see
plenty
of
people
become
fabulously
rich
from
their
startup
but
felt
that
they
be
gyp
themselves
out
of
one
of
the
potentially
most
reward
experience
and
might
never
discover
their
own
value
or
how
to
keep
their
newfound
wealth
in
perspective
this
be
steve

reflect
on
his
year
in
the
wilderness
the
year
of

he
have
turn
it
down
in
a
fit
of
pique
it

only
then
in
fail
when
he
go
out
on

he
learn
just
what
he
have

away
from
even
the
god
get
their
comeuppance
but
sometimes
you
get
to
return
home
where
a
run
of
the
mill
ceo
who
lead
his
company
into
a
new
product
area
might
consider
it
a
crown
achievement
for
steve
job
it
have
become
routine
now
he
be
about
to
do
it
again
and
in
the
process
shake
up
one
of
america
and
the
world
most
visible
most
incendiary
industry
not
just
shake
it
up
but
save
a
dinosaur
of
an
industry
from
the
threat
of
extinction
when
steve
have
be
instal
as
apple
interim
ceo
among
the
product
he
axed
be
the

first
practical
pda
it
have
be
release
prematurely
but
be
finally
come
to
maturity
as
a
product
and
be
just
about
at
break
even
with
a
hugely
promising
future
ahead
its
handwrite
recognition
feature
though
clumsy
and
unreliable
at
first
have
be
improve
to
a
surprisingly
accurate
state
that
be
not
match
by
any
other
product
for
year
gaston
bastien
the
belgian
who
be
the
vice
president

much
to
be
proud
of
john
sculley
have
spun
the
newton
group
off
set
it
up
as
a
separate
external
business
steve
have
first
brought
the
unit
back
into
apple
and
then
have
second
thought
close
it
down
for
him
the
newton
apparently
bore
one
great
flaw
it
have
not
be
create
by
him
bad
it
have
be
john
sculley
baby
all
the
more
reason
for
steve
to
cancel
it
it
be
the
same
with
the
computer
call
the
th
anniversary

gil
amelio
have
discover
a
small
development
project
tucked
away
in
a
dark
corner
of
r
d
and
have
fall
in
love
with
it
today
the
concept
sound
familiar
a
computer
screen
with
the
entire
computer
work
built
into
a
small
space
behind
the
display
that
be
a
description
of
the
g
imac
introduce
by
steve
job
in
it
be
also
a
description
of
the
computer
project
that
a
small
team
of
hardware
engineer
dream
into
reality
in
the
mid
s
though
it
would
carry
a
hefty
price
tag
gil
saw
it
as
a
handsome
machine
with
a
forward
look
appearance
that
computer
resistant
ceo
would
be
glad
to
have
on
their
desk
introduce
in
it
be
another
victim
of
the
job
massacre
after
his
return
ever
a
contradiction
steve
continued
to
show
sign
of
grow
more
settle
and
mature
while
at
the
same
time
action
like
these
give
testimony
that
the
old
steve
be
still
very
much
alive
although
he
be
gun
down
perfectly
viable
product
with
billy
the
kid
abandon
he
also
recognize
the
need
for
something
stunningly
new
to
revitalize
apple
and
the
new
digital
frontier
addition
to
the
macintosh
line
take
advantage
of
the
late
improvement
in
technology
and
the
internet
sure
but
this
be
not
enough
beyond
it
he
be
look
for
something
else
something
big
something
that
held
the
explosive
promise
of
become
the
next
new
thing
the
goal
he
say
be
to
revitalize
and
with
an
optimism
that
might
not
have
be
justified
at
the
time
but
turn
out
to
be
prescient
he
add
if
there
be
opportunity
we
would
see
them
eventually
his
eye
lit
on
the
music
scene
why
music
when
everybody
and
his
brother
be
launch
a
crash
project
to
create
some
new
kind
of
pda
in
a
interview
with
fortune
magazine
brent
schlender
steve
explain
you
ca
not
imagine
how
many
people
think
we
be
crazy
for
not
do
a
palm
a
handheld
pda
i
wo
not
lie
we
thought
about
that
a
lot
but
i
start
ask
myself
how
useful
be
they
really
how
many
people
at
a
give
meeting
show
up
with
one
whether
i
be
here
or
at
disney
or
at
pixar
the
percentage
peaked
about
a
year
ago
at
percent
and
it
be
now
dwindle
to
less
than
percent
it
kind
of
go
up
really
fast
and
then
go
down
i
do
not
mean
to
be
disrespectful
to
those
guy
at
palm
at
all
i
be
just
say
i
do
not
think
early
culture
have
organizer
but
i
do
know
they
have
music
it
be
in
our
dna
everybody
love
it
this
be
not
a
speculative
market
steve
public
relation
people
must
have
be
tear
their
hair
that
his
language
be
not
more
graceful
but
for
any
businessperson
idea
weigh
more
than
elegance
of
language
and
in
this
case
the
idea
be
very
much
on
target
with
so
many
project
shot
down
steve
be
desperate
to
find
something
revolutionary
his
industry
scout
turn
up
a
music
software
product
call
soundjam
mp

terry
do
not
think
the

be
strong
enough
to

but
thought
that
the
programmer
show
promise
he
offer
jeff
the
chance
to
work
on
a
product

go
away
to
think
about
it
and
come

a
job
with
apple
then
left

he
want
to
work
on
he
drop
by
c
g
once
again
and
told
them
about
his
idea
to
develop
well
mp
player
software
this
be
software
that
could
play
digital
sound
file
on
a

before
anyone
make
portable
device
the
result
of
his
effort
guide
by
input
from
c
g
on
the
feature
set
and
design
criterion
be
a
program
call
soundjam
mp
the
apple
engineering
staff
jumped
in
to
help
with
advice
and
guidance
on
the
development
they
really
like
what
we
be
do
it
really
show
off
the
mac
math
co
processor
terry
say
soundjam
become
the
most
popular
mp
player
on
the
market
quickly
grab
a
percent
share
of
the
macintosh
market
and
be
soon
pour
substantial
revenue
into
the
company
coffer
journalist
adam
engst
gush
that
soundjam
be
a
one
stop
solution
that
offer
a
compelling
alternative
to
the
mishmash
of
program
for
convert
encode
and
play
mp
s
in
a
short
time
the
three
man
company
grow
to
a
staff
of
about
forty
take
in
as
much
as
million
annually
with
the
lion
share
come
from
soundjam
thing
be
look
rosy
for
c
g
and
the
company
pour
money
back
into
the
development
of
new
product
jeff
stayed
involve
turn
out
new
improve
version
of
soundjam
every
three
or
four
month
and
do
the
upgrade
of
conflictcatcher
at
the
same
time
then
one
day
apple
come
to
us
like
an
pound
gorilla
the
company
want
to
buy
the
right
to
soundjam
and
the
offer
be
not
very
subtle
the
basic
message
terry
say
be
sell
the
right
or
we
will
develop
a
competitive
product
and
put
you
out
of
business
the
truth
be
that
give
what
apple
have
in
hand
there
be
not
enough
time
to
develop
a
competitive
product
especially
not
in
the
face
of
the
delivery
requirement
steve
have
secretly
impose
on
his
people
have
it
ready
for
sale
in
time
for
the
christmas
buying
season
c
g
have
no
way
of
know
all
this
the
good
news
be
that
apple
do
not
have
a
problem
with
c
g
continue
to
sell
soundjam
for
the
time
be
so
in
addition
to
be
paid
by
apple
for
right
to
the
product
code
the
company
would
still
have
a
healthy
cash
flow
from
its
own
sale
of
the
product
as
the
card
be
be
played
however
there
be
a
serious
downside
to
the
deal
apple
be
not
raid
the
company
just
for
the
software
but
also
for
warm
body
they
want
jeff
robbin
to
become
a
key
part
of
the
inhouse
software
team
modify
soundjam
to
become
the
applebranded
music
software
product
jeff
terry
say
have
not
like
the
atmosphere
at
apple
in
his
earlier
experience
there
but
the
company
make
him
an
offer
he
could
not
refuse
he
must
like
condition
well
since
his
return
as
of
this
write
jeff

still
at

only
windfall
from
apple
personnel

for
the
quality
of
its

of

team
apple
stole
two
of
the
top

people
and
hire
away
c
g
head
of

as
well
for
terry
that
last
bit

a
bad
taste
the

left
with
a
decimate
staff
contractual
limit
on
what

could

an
uncertainty
about
how
long
apple
would
permit
it
to
continue
sell
soundjam
on
top
of
that
c

jukebox
application
and
we
hope
its
dramatically
simpler
user
interface
will
bring
even
more
people
into
the
digital
music
revolution
with
itunes
apple
have
join
the
revolution
it
be
another
step
in
steve
creation
of
internet
service
to
go
along
with
apple
product
his
vision
of
the
apple
experience
from
cradle
to
grave
but
the
world
would
soon
learn
that
steve
job
be
not
just
join
the
revolution
he
be
about
to
reshape
it

ipod
itunes
therefore
i
be
somebody
finally
get
it
right
dr
dre
my
after
apple
have
come
up
for
air
from
the
hurry
up
project
to
stake
out
a
place
in
the
digital
music
file
area
do
steve
and
his
team
start
to
look
more
closely
at
the
music
field
while
some
people
download
music
to
play
on
their
computer
others
load
the
song
onto
their
rio
and
listen
while
drive
shopping
or
jogging
the
portable
player
offer
a
walkman
shrunk
down
to
pocket
size
user
could
listen
to
music
from
more
than
just
a
single
cd
and
more
pleasurably
than
from
a
radio
station
where
you
have
to
suffer
through
the
pain
of
commercial
and
talk
for
every
song
played
it
look
like
a
ready
make
market
yet
consumer
have
not
take
to
the
idea
steve
people
show
him
the
number
sale
of
the
device
be
anemic
why
be
not
they
sell
well
apple
vice
president
greg
joswiak
boil
it
down
to
the
basic
the
product
stank
steve
say
that
there
be
plenty
of
evidence
from
the
mp
player
already
out
there
that
consumer
electronics
maker
do
not
know
diddly
about
software
steve
have
shot
down
a
number
of
apple
development
effort
because
they
be
not
aim
at
create
product
that
match
the
company
core
focus
neither
do
an
mp
player
now
that
reason
do
not
seem
to
matter
anymore
he
saw
the
new
frontier
recognize
the
market
potential
and
seize
it
this
be
not
even
a
matter
of
play
catch
up
it
look
to
steve
as
if
the
other
company
in
the
field
be
not
offering
any
kind
of
tough
competition
the
entire
play
field
be
his
for
the
take
apple
already
have
itunes
a
track
record
for
great
industrial
design
and
a
heritage
all
the
way
back
to
steve
wozniak
for
miniaturization
the
card
seem
heavily
stack
in
favor
of
a
music
player
over
a
pda
that
of
course
turn
out
to
be
a
brilliant
decision
steve
give
himself
credit
for
be
the
one
who
start
the
ball
roll
see
the
possibility
in
a
lightning
bolt
of
inspiration
would
not
it
be
awesome
if
people
could
buy
high
quality
audio
track
via
the
internet
and
load
them
directly
into
itunes
instead
of
go
to
the
store
to
buy
cd
to
rip
apple
already
have
an
electronic
pushcart
the
apple
store
that
be
rack
up
billion
in
sale
every
year
on
computer
and
software
why
not
add
music
establish
a
beachhead
in
the
music
business
would
land
him
in
a
world
he
have
long
held
in
awe
though
mostly
from
a
distance
sure
he
could
get
u
s
bono
on
the
phone
he
could
extract
an
enthusiastic
quote
about
the
macintosh
from
rock
superstar
and
show
off
his
product
to
the
like
of
mick
jagger
yet
for
the
most
part
he
be
like
a
visitor
to
the
oscar
who
have
to
sit
behind
the
rope
on
the
sidewalk
bleacher
and
watch
the
glitterati
parade
past
how
would
apple
get
start
in
fact
a
practical
approach
for
create
a
music
player
have
be
hand
to
apple
on
a
platter
even
steve
do
not
always
know
where
the
next
big
thing
will
come
from
one
day
a
young
itinerant
high
tech
consultant
come
to
work
at
apple
with
the
rudiment
of
a
design
in
his
head
for
a
handheld
music
player
it
be
as
some
now
say
a
marriage
make
in
high
tech
heaven
but
it
could
only
have
work
with
the
new
steve
the
old
one
never
would
have
accepted
an
idea
that
he
have
not
champion
originally
the
hardware
guy
tony
fadell
he
pronounces
it
fuh
dell
have
work
on
develop
a
number
of
device
at
general
magic
a
company
start
by
some
of
the
original
mac
team
member
and
later
at
philip
after
philip
he
set
out
on
his
own
and
try
to
shop
around
the
idea
for
a
business
that
would
combine
a
hardware
element
an
mp
player
with
a
major
sale
element
a
napsterlike
music
source
he
try
it
out
on
several
company
with
no
success
but
it
turn
out
to
be
just
what
apple
be
look
for
steve
give
the
assignment
of
oversee
the
project
to
apple
head
hardware
honcho
jon
rubinstein
know
as
ruby
the
smart
harddriving
business
manager
steve
have
brought
along
with
him
from
next
this
be
not
a
project
ruby
could
afford
to
botch
he
saw
that
work
with
tony
make
all
kind
of
sense
because
the
development
work
that
tony
have
already
do
would
give
the
project
a
jump
start
but
when
ruby
say
he
want
to
meet
with
tony
the
apple
folk
who
have
be
in
touch
with
him
have
a
hard
time
track
him
down
tony
be
on
a
ski
slope
contact
be
make
and
ruby
offer
him
a
position
as
an
apple
employee
in
a
team
that
grow
to
be
about
thirty
people
strong
but
the
job
come
with
expectation
that
would
give
anyone
pause
he
would
have
to
design
a
product
distinctive
enough
and
intuitive
enough
to
use
that
it
would
meet
steve
job
exact
standard
to
make
the
assignment
all
the
tougher
steve
set
the
same
kind
of
deadline
he
have
set
for
turn
soundjam
into
itunes
the
product
would
have
to
be
ready
in
time
for
the
christmas
buying
season
less
than
twelve
month
away
of
course
try
to
live
up
to
steve
job
near
impossible
and
frequently
change
expectation
have
crush
many
strong
men
tony
accepted
ruby
offer
anyway
for
him
this
be
a
dream
job
do
what
he
have
spent
month
try
to
talk
some
company
into
let
him
do
fadell
decide
to
base
the
new
design
on
an
exist
product
portalplayer
from
a
company
in
nearby
santa
clara
california
some
people
consider
the
decision
unique
and
risky
perhaps
because
portalplayer
itself
have
be
in
business
less
than
two
year
at
the
time
still
the
company
have
a
stellar
leadership
team
and
be
back
in
part
by
venture
capitalist
gordon
campbell
who
have
dealt
with
steve
at
vlsi
many
year
before
he
seem
to
pop
up
everywhere
around
the
valley
and
have
a
handsome
reputation
for
choose
likely
winner
tony
have
do
his
homework
and
knew
that
portalplayer
be
work
on
design
for
at
least
two
mp
player
one
of
them
not
much
big
than
a
pack
of
cigarette
a
senior
manager
at
the
company
told
wire
com
journalist
leander
kahney
that
apple
spark
enthusiasm
among
the
portalplayer
people
by
tell
them
this
be
the
project
that
be
go
to
remold
apple
ten
year
from
now
we
be
go
to
be
a
music
business
not
a
computer
business
the
design
challenge
be
to
figure
out
how
to
achieve
superior
performance
and
shrink
the
good
into
a
small
package
but
not
draw
so
much
power
that
the
battery
run
down
quickly
this
be
a
little
like
pedal
a
bicycle
across
niagara
fall
on
a
high
wire
while
perform
a
juggling
act
despite
the
hurdle
tony
found
that
portalplayer
electronic
design
be
well
advanced
though
by
no
mean
finish
the
prototype
be
fairly
ugly
accord
to
company
manager
ben
knauss
one
in
particular
be
typical
of
an
interface
do
by
hardware
guy
it
look
like
an
fm
radio
with
a
bunch
of
button
knauss
figure
that
the
company
work
be
attractive
to
apple
because
we
have
an
operating
system
that
be
a
real
sell
point
we
have
the
software
and
the
hardware
already
do
all
the
more
important
because
steve
job
and
jon
rubinstein
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
bring
the
product
to
market
by
the
time
that
apple
come
on
the
scene
portalplayer
be
already
recognize
as
a
leader
in
the
field
of
mp
design
ibm
be
a
customer
along
with
some
dozen
other
company
mostly
asian
the
ibm
concept
call
for
a
sleek
black
pocket
size
player
design
to
work
with
bluetooth
headphone
a
feature
that
today
ipod
user
be
still
wait
for
but
steve
job
hold
an
unusually
proprietary
view
of
intellectual
property
one
condition
demand
of
portalplayer
be
that
it
renounce
its
other
customer
this
could
not
have
be
easy
but
tony
fadell
prediction
that
this
project
would
remold
apple
may
have
be
enough
of
a
carrot
to
help
the
decision
along
for
most
of
that
year
the
entire
engineering
force
of
portalplayer
in
the
united
state
and
in
india
work
only
on
the
new
apple
mp
device
steve
job
stayed
close
to
the
project
all
the
way
his
brilliance
as
a
marketer
and
his
flawless
taste
in
design
shin
through
in
his
rigorous
as
ever
demand
for
the
high
standard
in
his
interview
for
the
wire
com
piece
portalplayer
ben
knauss
recall
steve
would
be
horribly
offend
he
could
not
get
to
the
song
he
want
in
less
than
three
push
of
a
button
on
other
occasion
the
team
be
told
steve
do
not
think
it
be
loud
enough
the
sharp
be
not
sharp
enough
the
menu
not
come
up
fast
enough
every
day
knauss
say
there
be
comment
from
steve
say
what
improvement
he
want
about
the
order
to
boost
sound
volume
knauss
say
that
the
maximum
volume
be
louder
than
almost
any
other
mp
player
his
explanation
be
that
steve
be
partly
deaf
though
this
be
a
contention
that
close
friend
of
steve
vehemently
deny
because
of
the
impossibly
short
schedule
there
be
not
any
time
to
custom
design
computer
chip
as
it
turn
out
that
be
just
as
well
perhaps
the
music
quality
could
have
be
a
tad
well
the
unit
a
little
lighter
or
the
battery
longer
last
if
the
designer
have
start
from
scratch
but
they
be
stuck
with
off
the
shelf
component
and
they
make
it
work
here
be
another
sign
that
steve
have
mature
adjust
to
the
reality
of
the
world
as
it
be
instead
of
the
world
as
he
want
it
to
be
at
apple
in
the
early
day
he
would
go
outside
the
company
for
creative
aspect
like
product
design
and
advertising
for
everything
else
steve
blindly
follow
the
corrupt
nih
philosophy
not
invent
here
the
technology
have
to
be
do
within
apple
if
his
technical
wizard
do
not
know
how
to
do
something
they
would
just
hire
someone
who
do
go
outside
the
company
simply
be
not
acceptable
he
who
ca
not
change
his
idea
be
a
prisoner
of
his
past
steve
be

out
of

much
praise
from
his
peer
and
the
appreciation
of
consumer
with
his
creation
of
the
futuristic
look
that
become
the
imac
signature
style
meanwhile
he
have
ruffle
feather
by
declare
that
the
computer
industry
be
creatively
bankrupt
jonathan
consider
apple
computer
a
stellar
place
to
work
because
the
bos
share
his
love
of
excellent
design
he
considers
steve
an
exceptional
designer
when
jonathan
ive
have
earlier
create
the
look
of
apple
first
elegant
laptop
the
powerbook
he
comment
expectation
be
extraordinarily
high
it
be
a
bit
scary
in
he
face
even
high
expectation
only
this
time
they
be
not
from
the
public
but
from
his
bos
steve
job
from
early
on
we
want
a
product
that
would
seem
so
natural
and
so
inevitable
and
so
simple
you
almost
would
not
think
of
it
as
have
be
design
he
say
like
everyone
else
on
the
project
i
knock
myself
out
not
so
much
because
it
be
a
challenge
which
it
be
but
because
i
want
to
have
one
he
say
only
later
as
it
come
together
do
the
broader
significance
of
what
we
be
work
on
become
apparent
how
many
company
could
tackle
a
project
in
a
brand
new
category
create
a
groundbreaking
widget
that
look
great
and
work
well
than
anyone
else
and
do
it
all
in
under
a
year
it
happen
only
because
steve
job
crack
the
whip
in
his
usual
role
of
slave
driver
taskmaster
and
ringmaster
his
odd
unlikely
incomprehensible
charisma
drew
people
into
his
spell
yet
this
magnetism
be
intersperse
with
daily
tantrum
that
make
employee
cringe
and
want
to
crawl
under
the
table
many
creative
people
become
tongue
tie
and
virtually
incoherent
when
they
try
to
explain
their
art
steve
the
college
dropout
could
have
be
forgiven
if
he
belong
to
that
fraternity
instead
he
be
often
surprisingly
perceptive
in
a
interview
steve
say
design
be
a
funny
word
some
people
think
design
mean
how
it
look
but
of
course
if
you
dig
deeper
it
be
really
how
it
work
to
design
something
really
well
you
have
to
get
it
you
have
to
really
grok
what
it
be
all
about
a
geek
word
to
grok
be
a
coinage
of
science
fiction
writer
r
a
heinlein
meaning
to
understand
something
thoroughly
by
have
empathy
with
it
steve
go
on
it
take
a
passionate
commitment
to
really
thoroughly
understand
something
most
people
do
not
take
the
time
to
do
that
he
then
proceed
to
tell
a
story
that
both
shed
light
on
his
private
life
and
give
some
insight
into
the
decision
make
process
that
often
turn
life
into
a
hell
for
people
who
work
with
him
make
the
point
that
design
be
not
just
an
issue
for
fancy
new
gadget
he
described
how
his
whole
family
become
involve
in
of
all
thing
the
selection
of
a
new
wash
machine
and
dryer
this
be
a
little
hard
to
picture
the
billionaire
job
family
do
not
have
very
good
machine
select
new
one
become
a
project
for
the
whole
family
the
big
decision
come
down
to
whether
to
purchase
a
european
machine
or
an
american
make
one
the
european
machine
accord
to
steve
do
a
much
well
job
us
about
one
quarter
as
much
water
and
treat
the
clothes
more
gently
so
that
they
last
longer
but
the
american
machine
take
about
half
as
long
to
wash
the
clothes
we
spent
some
time
in
our
family
talk
about
what
the
tradeoff
we
want
to
make
we
spent
about
two
week
talk
about
this
every
night
at
the
dinner
table
imagine
dinner
table
conversation
about
wash
machine
every
night
we
would
get
around
to
that
old
washer
dryer
discussion
and
the
talk
be
about
design
in
the
end
they
opt
for
european
machine
which
steve
described
as
too
expensive
but
that
be
just
because
nobody
buy
them
in
this
country
of
course
this
be
not
really
about
wash
machine
it
be
about
passing
along
the
concern
for
design
to
his
child
and
perhaps
to
laurene
the
decision
clearly
give
him
more
pleasure
than
you
would
expect
he
call
the
new
machine
one
of
the
few
product
we
have
bought
over
the
last
few
year
that
we
be
all
really
happy
about
these
guy
have
really
thought
the
process
through
they
do
such
a
great
job
design
these
washer
and
dryer
steve
surprising
tagline
on
the
story
say
a
great
deal
about
how
much
design
really
mean
to
him
i
get
more
thrill
out
of
them
than
i
have
out
of
any
piece
of
high
tech
in
year
despite
what
seem
to
be
an
unrealistic
deadline
reminiscent
of
steve
earlier
hopelessly
inaccurate
promise
for
the
first
macintosh
the
ipod
be
actually
track
on
schedule
in
august
several
prototype
be
ready
for
test
with
focus
group
the
design
be
still
very
much
under
wrap
and
steve
be
manic
about
leak
so
each
unit
be
seal
in
a
separate
reinforce
plastic
box
much
large
than
the
actual
unit
closer
to
the
size
of
a
shoebox
wire
for
the
control
be
strung
to
random
spot
on
the
exterior
of
the
box
on
some
the
scroll
wheel
be
on
the
side
for
example
and
the
screen
on
the
top
anyone
look
at
the
box
would
have
no
idea
how
the
control
be
place
on
the
actual
unit
it
be
all
part
of
keep
the
competition
off
balance
until
the
veil
be
lift
at
the
official
introduction
and
part
of
the
increase
paranoia
about
leak
that
afflicts
steve
for
steve
the
ipod
provide
an
excuse
to
hang
out
with
prominent
artist
of
the
music
world
several
of
them
be
so
blown
away
by
the
product
that
they
gladly
allow
themselves
to
be
film
for
clip
in
the
video
to
be
show
at
the
product

enthuse
i
have
have
three
mp

and
i
have
not
figure
out
how
to
use
any
of
them
and
this
one
i
held
it
and
second
later
i
knew
how
to
use
it
seal
a
british
soul
vocalist
who
be
then
work
on
his
third
album

you
can
see
the
thought
and
the
time
and
the
love
that
be
go
into
it
it
be
just
wonderful
i
want
it
now

frontman
steve

express
a
sentiment
that
many
ipod
owner
later
share
i
will
take
two
of
em
one
for
me
and
one
for
my

cuz
i
be
not
sharin
this
with
nobody
he
also
express
a
sentiment
that
ever
irreverent
steve
job
must
have
particularly
enjoy
this
kick
every
other
product
as
right
here
even
member
of
the
apple
team
who
work
on
the
project

get
pumped

group
leader
ive
comment
as
a
design
team
i
cannot
remember
the
last
time
where
we
be
collectively
lust
after
a
product
as
badly
as
we
be
after
an
ipod
no
project
ever
go
smoothly
from
start
to
finish
late
in
the
game
when
the
parameter
of
the
electronic
design
be
already
lock
in
routine
test
reveal
an
alarm
flaw
when
the
ipod
be
turn
off
it
continued
to
draw
battery
power
turn
it
off
at
bedtime
and
by
morning
the
unit
would
be
dead
actually
it
be
even
bad
than
that
three
hour
in
the
off
state
be
enough
to
drain
the
battery
all
the
way
down
accord
to
portalplayer
ben
knauss
the
production
line
have
already
be
set
up
that
be
a
tense
part
of
the
project
for
eight
week
they
thought
they
have
a
three
hour
mp
player
by
the
time
the
problem
be
fix
ben
have
lose
confidence
he
quit
shortly
before
the
release
date
suspicious
that
the
product
would
flop
it
be
probably
a
mistake
but
then
you
have
to
go
with
what
you
think
at
the
time
as
the
day
ticked
off
toward
the
splashy
october
launch
event
a
routine
item
in

savvy
be

that
it
could
not
figure
out
how
to
survive
in
consumer
electronics
and
one
of
the
division
product
have
be
a

there

the
high

apple
have
invent
a
whole
new
category
of
digital

that
let
you
put
your
entire
music
collection
in
your
pocket
and
listen
to
it
wherever
you
go
steve
brag

not
this
cool
steve
ask
the
assemble
crowd
demonstrate
how
quick
and
painless
the
designer
have
make
it
to
transfer

he
say
itunes

all
about

and
ipod
know
all
about

another
of
the
great
feature
the
software
and
the
hardware
be
so
well
integrate
that
the
user
do
not
need
to
do
anything
more
than
plug
the
ipod
into
the
computer
and
any
new
song
store
on
the
computer
would
automatically
download
but
then
steve
job
have
practically
define
the
standard
for
ease
of
use
and
he
have
personally
crack
the
whip
over
ipod
design
team
and
engineer
no
one
who
understood
steve
could
have
expect
anything
less
this
product
once
again
raise
the
bar
by
be
a
device
that
have
no
need
for
a
thick
user
manual
he
say
with
ipod
listen
to
music
will
never
be
the
same
again
the
statement
prove
to
be
truer
than
steve
job
could
ever
have
imagine
some
industry
observer
make
snide
remark
about
the
ipod
especially
about
the
price
significantly
high
than
most
competitive
product
there
be
small
mp
player
around
at
the
time
as
well
as
others
that
could
hold
a
lot
of
music
but
the
ipod
answer
both
demand
in
a
single
package
small
size
big
capacity
yet
initial
reaction
from
the
marketplace
be
mixed
the
thing
cost
so
much
more
than
exist
digital
player
that
it
prompt
one
online
skeptic
to
suggest

steve

knew
about

have
not
he
be
the
pirate
king
in
the
early
macintosh
day
nearly
twenty
year
ago
steve
have
foreseen
that
he
would
be
wad
into
crocodile
infest
water
music
piracy
would
be
a
radical
issue
with
the
music
store
far
more
than
with
itunes
and
the
ipod
it
be
an
issue
steve
have
deep
feeling
about
he
be
well
aware
of
the
blood
sweat
and
tear
that
go
into
any
creative
endeavor
and
so
have
a
high
degree
of
sensitivity
than
most
people
do
about
the
value
of
a
musician
work
apple
be
one
of
the
few
company
in
our
industry
that
own
any
intellectual
property
he
say
we
know
how
expensive
it
be
to
develop
it
and
so
we
really
believe
in
protect
it
protection
have
be
built
into
the
ipod
to
deter
piracy
not
the
rigid
customer
be
damn
kind
of
restriction
that
the
music
industry
favor
certainly
not
the
anything
go
freedom
of
the
college
campus
and
song
swappers
but
a
sensible
carefully
thought
out
plan
that
would
collect
appropriate
royalty
payment
on
a
scale
that
music
lover
could
live
with
he
believe
that
most
people
give
a
reasonable
choice
would
choose
to
do
the
right
thing
steal
music
be
a
behavioral
problem
more
than
a
technological
problem
he
say
we
believe
most
people
be
honest
and
want
to
pay
for
their
music
part
of
the
challenge
he
believe
be
make
sure
that
be
dishonest
be
not
too
easy
with
the
ipod
steve
have
driven
his
people
to
devise
a
scheme
that
would
meet
his
demand
standard
for
ease
of
use
while
at
the
same
time
throw
up
barrier
for
people
who
try
to
use
their
ipod
to
share
music
file
with
others
you
can
transfer
music
from
your
computer
to
your
ipod
in
a
breeze
but
do
not
expect
to
be
able
to
load
those
song
onto
someone
else
computer
or
to
download
song
from
someone
else
computer
onto
your
ipod
steve
explain
that
if
you
try
to
sync
your
ipod
with
someone
else
mac
a
message
would
warn
you
that
continue
the
operation
would
load
the
new
tune
but
would
also
erase
all
the
music
you
already
have
store
and
then
when
you
get
back
to
your
own
mac
the
same
thing
would
happen
in
fact
it
turn
out
that
there
be
a
fairly
easy
workaround
but
it
be
unlikely
that
more
than
a
small
number
of
hard
core
user
ever
learn
the
trick
do
steve
know
the
protection
could
be
defeat
so
easily
after
all
this
be
the
man
who
once
love
to
circumvent

refuse

on
the

steve

hour
drive
north
of

in
the
heart
of

look
radiant
pumped
as
usual
in

of
an
audience
his
charisma
turn
up
to
the
max
he
launch
into
his
announcement
of
the
itunes

steve
the
outsider
have
do
what
observer
would
have
predict
be
impossible
get
signature
on
agreement
with
the
top
music
company
he
would
want
those
agreement
so
badly
that
he
would
do
the
negotiate
personally
ordinarily
on
an
issue
with
as
many
strategic
implication
as
this
the
ceo
would
have
agree
in
principle
and
then
left
their
underling
to
see
whether
an
agreement
could
be
work
out
steve
get
each
ceo
to
say
we
will
consider
it
and
then
have
be
willing
to
do
the
horse
trading
himself
even
for
steve
job
break
the
logjam
of
the
music
industry
be
no
pushover
hilary
rosen
who
be
then
chief
executive
of
riaa
the
record
industry
association
of
america
explain
that
top
executive
of
major
music
company
be
wary
of
people
from
the
computer
industry
who
in
the
past
have
show
little
grasp
of
music
industry
issue
the
music
industry
be
very
focus
on
how
to
create
a
simple
push
play
kind
of
environment
because
that
be
what
consumer
be
use
to
the
it
industry
have
never
operate
with
those
sort
of
standard
before
so
when
steve
first
approach
the
record
company
there
be
skepticism
that
he
could
pull
it
off
steve
won
them
over
for
two
reason
hilary
believe
the
first
be
mundane
and
almost
laughable
apple
have
such
a
small
market
share
that
it
make
their
risk
fairly
low
the
other
reason
be
not
unexpected
the
shift
come
about
above
all
because
of
the
sheer
willpower
of
steve
his
sheer
charisma
and
his
intensity
absolutely
make
a
difference
then
there
be
steve
attention
to
detail
hilary
come
to
appreciate
that
aspect
from
personal
observation
the
first
time
he
show
me
a
prototype
of
the
apple
music
store
we
be
sit
in
a
conference
room
with
a
couple
of
member
of
his
team
they
have
just
come
back
with
yet
another
version
base
on
feedback
that
they
have
gotten
steve
spent
about
twenty
minute
back
and
forth
with
the
engineer
about
the
best
place
within
a
three
square
inch
section
to
put
three
word
he
be
that
focus
on
the
detail
of
the
design
sheer
enthusiasm
also
help
to
win
over
the
music
industry
executive
to
lot
of
folk
in
the
tech
world
hilary
say
music
be
just
software
steve
be
an
incredible
music
fan
for
people
in
the
music
industry
that
be
very
special
many
people
hilary
say
believe
that
universal
first
sign
up
for
steve
vision
in
fact
steve
developed
a
relationship
at
the
outset
with
roger
ames
at
warner
roger
be
really
the
first
one
to
jump
on
board
one
executive
who
be
closely
involve
in
the
negotiation
for
a
top
five
music
firm
saw
the
action
from
an
inside
perspective
the
music
company
he
say
have
be
wary
about
the
idea
of
download
drag
their
foot
unwilling
to
move
ahead
until
completely
satisfied
with
every
detail
of
the
term
then
steve
job
show
up
on
the
scene
suddenly
the
source
say
the
industry
fold
at
his
foot
acquiesce
to
whatever
he
want
there
be
a
train
about
to
leave
and
everybody
want
to
be
damn
sure
their
company
be
on
it
for
the
first
time
the
leverage
in
negotiate
download
deal
shift
to
the
other
side
it
be
the
same
at
all
five
of
the
company
he
say
speak
on
condition
of
anonymity
he
described
one
of
the
most
visible
executive
vice
president
in
the
music
industry
who
be
that
company
point
man
in
deal
with
steve
the
target
for
every
bit
of
steve
overpower
charisma
every
time
our
informant
saw
the
vice
president
during
this
period
the
man
be
full
of
talk
about
steve
this
and
steve
that
he
be
completely
take
in
glow
as
if
he
have
just
found
his
true
love
or
at
least
a
lifelong
friend
if
the
vice
president
have
be
ask
the
informant
say
he
would
have
knelt
down
and
shin
steve
shoe
and
would
have
be
willing
to
do
it
in
front
of
a
conference
room
of
other
people
other
executive
quickly
fell
in

because
what
steve
be
propose

so
much
sense
andrew
lack
ceo
of
sony

entertainment
be
one
of
those
i
do
not

the
only
thing
that

that

pursue

not
that
they
have
any

slight
the

but
they
have
also
spot
the
impressive
sale
in
various
corner
of

market
the

make
an
attractive

microsoft
be
not
alone
merely
the
elephant
lead
the

and
hop
for
a
replay
of

neither
steve

ever
forgets
the
day
when
apple
be
king
of
the
hill
in
the
computer
business
with
the
apple
ii
while
microsoft
be
just
another
small
company
look
on
with
envy
mike
murray
steve
marketing
manager
for
the
macintosh
use
to
say
that
steve
would
beat
up

every
once
in
a

during
the
year
before
the

apple
be
the
most
important
personal
computer
company
in
the

on
the
basis
of
the
apple
ii
gate
turn
the
table
on
apple
once
before
and
do
not
see
any
reason
why
he
ca
not
do
the
same
this
time
around
this
story
have
played
out
on
the
pc
and
work
very
well
for
the
choice
approach
there
he
say
but
the
consumer
market
be
fundamentally
different
from
the
humorless
business
environment
microsoft
even
with
gate
billion
may
well
be
outclass
outgunned
and
outmaneuver
by
steve

what
happens
when
rival
enter
the

with

player
design
to
match
the
most
prize
feature
of
the

even
the
best
of
these
entry
probably
wo
not
have
the
snazzy
with
it
allure
of
the

but
some
be
certainly
low

what
more
the
ipod
work
only
with

from

music
store
competitive
model
will
give

a
much
wider
choice
of

this
be
not
a

that
apple

own
forever
some
erosion
be
already
occur
ring
early
in
apple
announce

cut
for

the
big
issue
be
how
much
be
cool
worth
in
a
world
of
undifferentiated
product
and
wal
mart
retailer
would
not
most
consumer
be
willing
to
pay
more
to
have
an
undeniably
cool
product
maybe
they
would
not
pay
thousand
more
but
less
than
be
probably
safe
especially
when
the
user

of
the

the
part

that
steve

before

when
ask
he

alone

eisner
knew
exactly
how
to

steve
propel

and
eisner
knew
it
he
also
knew
that
he
could
use
it
as
a
club
to
batter
steve
in
the
medium
still
eisner
make
some
friendly
overture
invite
steve
to
a
springtime
dinner
at
an
indian
restaurant
in
the

steve
quipped
i
would

we
have

they
also
go

game
in
the
fall
of

reporter
ask
steve
if
it
meant
the
two
have
a
rapprochement
he
be
equally
dismissive
sometimes
a
baseball
game
be
just
a
baseball
game
he
retort
it
make
a
certain
poetic
sense
that
steve
would
seek
a
deal
similar
to
the
one
george
lucas
have
work
out
with
fox
financing
and
produce
his
own
film
lucas
own
them
in
toto
merely
pay
fox
a
fee
for
handle
his
distribution
by
industry
standard
it
be
a
lousy
deal
for
fox
but
the
company
do
make
some
money
from
the
arrangement
and
also
benefit
from
the
connection
to

with
much
high
distribution
fee
a
much
longer

sequel
no

would
have
willingly
sacrifice
so
much
even
to

valuable
partnership
we
be
not
for
rent
for
anybody
eisner
say
he
want
a
partnership
and
in
his
mind
it
be
disney
who
brought
the
most
to
the
table
negotiation
devolve
to
the
point
that

where
he
felt
he
have
some
connection
though
these

the

be
personal
as
early
as
steve
have
be
buttonholing
various
disney
exec
to
warn
them
that
he
and
michael
eisner
could
not
work
together
i
do
not
see
how
the
relationship
can
continue
as
long
as
eisner
be
there
he
told
one
executive
this
dovetail
with
a
boardroom
battle
brewing
in
the
magic
kingdom
roy
disney
walt
nephew
have
decide
that
eisner
have
to
go
after
a
dinner
at
steve
home
in
palo
alto
to
sound
out
his
feeling
roy
be
alarmed
it
seem
as
though
steve
be
willing
to
take
pixar
out
of
the
disney
fold
and
that
would
be
disastrous
for
the
company
ail
profit
roy
have
reson
to
be
concerned
the
ax
be
about
to
swing
and
the
woodsman
be
steve
job
in
january
pixar
abruptly
end
negotiation
after
ten
frustrate
month
we
end
our
talk
with
disney
steve
say
frustrate
be
no
slip
of
the
tongue
with
that
one
word
steve
make
his
position
clear
the
talk
be
not
friendly
pixar
played
the
victim
of
eisner
tyranny
justified
or
not
steve
act
as
if
disney
and
eisner
have
broken
a
solemn
oath
of
loyalty
to
pixar
he
never
fire
a
single
public
warn
shot
before
make
his
announcement
about
the
walkout
not
even
dick
cook
the
disney
studio
chief
knew
that
steve
plan
to
pack
up
his
tent
and
move
on
and
steve
actually
like
cook
steve
could
not
stand
the
thought
of
disney
hold
beloved
pixar
character
and
movie
title
captive
it
make
him
resent
their
current
agreement
all
the
more
we
feel
sick
about
disney
do
sequel
he
say
because
if
you
look
at
the
quality
of
their
sequel
like
the
lion
king
and
their
peter
pan
sequel
it
be
pretty
embarrass
in
his
view
disney
have
never
contribute
to
pixar
creative
process
the
truth
be
that
there
have
be
little
creative
collaboration
with
disney
for
year
he
say
the
collaboration
we
do
have
with
disney
be
center
around
the
marketing
of
the
film
not
the
make
of
them
he
even
denigrate
disney
marketing
effort
he
paid
a
compliment
to
dick
cook
and
his
talented
marketing
team
but
then
allude
to
the
disney
flop
and
add
but
no
amount
of
marketing
will
turn
a
dud
into
a
hit
in
other
word
disney
could
not
even
market
its
own
production
into
blockbuster
his
final
insult
however
be
also
the
most
point
we
think
the
pixar
brand
be
now
the
most
powerful
and
trust
brand
in
animation
steve
say
he
mention
disney
own
research
show
that
pixar
have
transcend
disney
as
a
brand
pixar
be
now
more
persuasive
and
meaningful
to
movie
fan
than
disney
be
steve
want
a
deal
that
would
reflect
it
disney
lick
its
wound
and
bit
back
zenia
mucha
the
disney
senior
vice
president
of
corporate
communication
call
it
sad
and
unfortunate
that
he
have
resort
to
insult
and
name
call
in
the
wake
of
the
disagreement
we
expect
well
of
him
the
stevian
snipe
at
disney
animation
reek
of
ego
the
lion
king
simba
pride
hold
a
dvd
sale
record
most
of
the
disney
sequel
have
be
runaway
dvd
hit
the

and
the

ii
scamp
adventure
sell
more
than
three
million
copy
within
its
first
six
day
on
the
shelf
steve
meant
failure
in
another
sense
something
more
intangible
than
profit
or
award
to
him
disney
fail
at
create
you
can
compare
the
creative
quality
of
pixar
last
three
film
with
the
creative
quality
of
disney
last
three
film
and
judge
each
company
creative
ability
for
yourself
he
say
in
part
steve
still
smart
from
previous
wrestling
match
with
eisner
a
year
earlier
in
the
spring
of
eisner
have
testify
before
the
senate
commerce
committee
that
apple
rip
mix
burn
marketing
campaign
practically
give
consumer
permission
to
create
a
theft
if
they
buy
his
computer
eisner
and
other
entertainment
executive
worried
about
digital
duplication
and
internet
file
share
resent
what
they
saw
as
apple
complicity
in
consumer
theft
digital
piracy
threaten
to
severely
cut
profit
and
damage
brand
swap
pirate
digital
version
of
movie
on
the
internet
pose
no
lethal
threat
yet
the
quality
of
most
of
the
hollywood
movie
then
available
online
range
from
poor
to
dismal
and
download
a
high
quality
digital
movie
could
take
hour
of
online
time
even
so
technology
improves
at
a
rapid
pace
it
be
no
wonder
that
eisner
and
other
hollywood
czar
be
look
nervously
over
their
shoulder
napster
have
shaken
the
music
business
almost
bring
the
entire
industry
to
its
knee
the
same
could
happen
to
the
film
business
the
testimony
against
the
rip
mix
burn
campaign
be
gall
to
steve
it
make
no
sense
disney
be
after
all
steve
partner
in
the
movie
business
why
would
eisner
attack
his
own
partner
even
in
another
area
steve
later
comment
rip
in
that
phrase
mean
take
the
bit
off
the
cd
and
put
em
on
your
hard
drive
rip
the
bit
off
your
cd
as
if
you
be
physically
rip
them
off
and
put
them
on
your
hard
drive
michael
eisner
because
he
do
not
have
any
teenage
kid
living
at
home
and
he
do
not
have
any
teenage
kid
work
at
disney
that
he
talk
to
thought
rip
meant
rip
off
and
when
somebody
actually
clue
him
in
to
what
it
meant
he
do
apologize
pixar
also
clung
to
bitter
memory
of
toy
story
when
eisner
whip
out
the
contract
and
interpret
every
comma
period
and
dot
i
in
his
favor
insist
that
the
sequel
could
not
count
in
the
multifilm
deal
then
he
do
the
unforgivable
accord
to
the
los
angeles
time
he
publicly
brag
about
the
leverage
he
have
over
pixar
now
steve
could
brag
just
as
loudly
steve
view
of
the
negotiation
seem
to
hold
sway
with
stockholder
on
news
that
he
have
walk
out
of
talk
pixar
stock
climbed
while
disney
fell
stockholder
appear
for
a
moment
at
least
to
stand
firmly
on
pixar
side
it
make
it
look
like
eisner
do
something
wrong
again
but
we
should
not
jump
to
conclusion
say
patrick
mckeigue
an
analyst
at
independence
investment
not
exactly
a
vote
of
confidence
for
eisner
but
not
an
indictment
either
the
wall
street
journal
note
that
disney
stood
poise
to
profit
even
more
now
that
its
studio
could
produce
pixar
sequel
without
share
half
the
take
medium
analyst
jeffrey
logsdon
say
that
disney
earnings
would
not
be
that
dramatically
different
in
term
of
dollar
in
addition
pixar
would
be
force
to
pony
up
its
own
production
fund
and
possibly
open
film
head
to
head
against
disney
release
and
against
katzenberg
release
from
dreamworks
and
pdi
as
well
eisner
have
say
earlier
about
the
possibility
of
a
disney
pixar
divorce
we
be
martin
and
lewis
we
be
abbott
and
costello
we
be
a
well
team
together
than
separate
i
know
it
i
hope
he
know
it
abbott
and
costello
do
eisner
mean
to
allude
to
one
of
the
most
famous
feud
in
entertainment
history
perhaps
so
because
abbott
and
costello
knew
well
than
to
split
despite
their
difference
i
have
always
felt
from
day
one
eisner
say
that
it
be
in
pixar
best
interest
to
continue
with
the
disney
company
but
we
can
only
make
half
the
deal
dennis
mcalpine
of
the
research
firm
mcalpine
associate
sum
up
the
catch
the
pixar
folk
would
be
foolish
to
go
somewhere
else
because
this
deal
have
work
disney
on
the
other
hand
would
be
foolish
to
let
them
go
because
this
deal
have
work
still
pixar
have
incredibly
account
for
more
than
percent
of
the
disney
film
studio
operating
income
between
and
merrill
lynch
put
that
at
percent
of
disney
studio
profit
the
wall
street
journal
sum
up
eisner
dilemma
the
move
be
a
highprofile
setback
for
disney
chairman
and
chief
executive
michael
eisner
whose
company
often
have
rely
heavily
on
pixar
smash
like
find
nemo
to
generate
the
profit
disney
own
animate
film
could
not
produce
in
recent
year
financials
aside
the
pixar
walkout
smell
distinctly
personal
dennis
mcalpine
say
about
steve
and
eisner
that
if
you
put
them
in
a
room
together
the
chance
of
them
come
out
unscathed
be
impossible
indeed
the
clash
between
steve
job
and
michael
eisner
seem
almost
destine
fat
in
the
shakespearean
sense
on
one
side
sits
steve
who
spent
his
childhood
and
adolescence
in
california
the
epicenter
of
two
cultural
quake
technology
and
s
psychedelic
music
he
love
bob
dylan
and
computer
he
hat
television
he
still
do
when
you
be
young
you
look
at
television
and
think
there
be
a
conspiracy
the
network
have
conspire
to
dumb
us
down
for
steve
television
be
the
most
corrosive
technology
ever
he
prefers
technology
that
spur
him
to
interact
and
think
and
he
have
spent
his
life
give
the
world
computer
that
enhance
exactly
that
when
he
saw
music
and
technology
at
odds
with
each
other
due
to
internet
file
share
he
set
about
make
peace
the
apple
itunes
music
store
be
nothing
less
than
the
culmination
of
all
his
creative
dream
this
will
go
down
in
history
as
a
turn
point
for
the
music
industry
steve
say
he
have
prove
yet
again
that
his
idea
could
in
fact
change
the
world
just
as
with
pixar
technology
and
art
have
converge
into
one
he
make
a
dent
in
the
universe
on
the
other
side
sits
eisner
who
grow
up
in
manhattan
america
capital
city
for
live
theater
and
entertainment
he
have
start
his
college
education
as
a
pre
med
student
but
switch
to
literature
a
summer
job
as
an
nbc
page
spark
a
desire
to
work
in
the
entertainment
industry
he
love
television
eisner
say
that
his
father
require
him
to
read
two
hour
for
every
hour
of
television
that
he
want
to
watch
i
come
from
manhattan
and
when
you
be
make
to
read
so
you
can
watch
this
new
technology
call
television
honestly
to
me
it
be
kind
of
a
chore
eisner
be
dazzle
by
the
promise
of
technology
just
as
steve
be
the
key

we

it
devolve

john

they

aspire

at
the

finish
what
would
turn
out
to
be
a
masterpiece
the

for
warner

a
critically
acclaim
though
underappreciated
animate

it
hint
at
intrigue
possibility
for
a
collaboration
with
pixar
brad
have
not
work
with
computer
base
animation
but
it
make
no
difference
he
have
what
it
take
to
succeed
at

the
quality
that
john
lasseter
most
value
a
passion
for
good
story
in
many
way
he
be
the
obvious
choice
brad
have
land
his
first
job
in
animation
when
he
be
hire
by
disney
at
the
tender
age
of
fifteen
to
work
under
milt
kahl
the
man
behind
iconic
movie
like
bambi
and
dalmatian
he
be
my
hero
say
brad
it
be
like
be
an
actor
and
get
coached
by
brando
but
once
walt
die
brad
say
watch
disney
film
get
make
as
mike
barrier
say
in
funnyworld
be
like
watch
master
chef
cook
hot
dog
the
film
still
stun
with
their
visual
brilliance
but
they
be
base
on
what
brad
call
lame
idea
he
end
up
study
animation
at
calarts
on
a
disney
scholarship
where
he
first
met
john
lasseter
after
graduation
he
have
to
decide
between
return
to
disney
or
accept
an
offer
to
work
on
the
simpson
where
the
idea
be
amaze
but
the
animation
less
than
stellar
though
devote
to
animation
he
chose
idea
and
go
to
work
on
the
simpson
give
the
same
circumstance
john
lasseter
would
undoubtedly
have
make
the
same
decision
brad
have
prove
himself
to
be
a
living
breathing
example
of
exactly
the
kind
of
character
pixar
so
love
he
commit
himself
to
idea
above
profit
margin
artistry
over
formula
when
john
lasseter
call
and
say
the
door
be
open
brad
come
in
and
pitch
a
story
call
the
incredibles
it
would
be
a
computer
graphic
animation
feature
with
gasp
an
entire
family
of
human
superheroes
human
being
be
notoriously
difficult
to
depict
in
cg
animation
which
be
why
so
many
film
feature
animal
or
monster
with
as
few
human
character
as
possible
to
propose
a
feature
of
all
human
character
to
a
cg
animation
studio
would
be
tantamount
to
creative
suicide
if
you
be
pitch
to
any
other
lead
animation
studio
but
john
be
happy
with
the
idea
of
a
challenge
that
would
throw
the
studio
off
balance
push
his
animator
and
technical
wizard
to
the
limit
it
be
just
the
kind
of
challenge
he
have
thrown
at
his
animator
all
along
but
this
time
scale
up
to
the
near
impossible
pixar
say
yes
to
the
incredibles
and
to
the
company
first
outsider
in
all
respect
say
ed
catmull
we
be
look
for
people
who
be
well

we

who
do

not
do
you

memo
that
ovitz
strength
of
personality
together
with
his
erratic
behavior
and
pathological
problem
and
i
hate
say
that
be
a
mixture
lead
to
disaster
for
this
company
the
big
problem
be
that
nobody
trust
him
for
he
cannot
tell
the
truth
the
two
be
on
the

side
in

both
desperate
to
establish
that
the

paid

be
proper
and
justified

each
be
do
an
admirable
job

off
at

eisner
write
a
number
of
the
ovitz
related
memo
himself
in
longhand
or
pecked
out
on
the
keyboard
presumably
to
prevent
mindy
his
personal
assistant
from

his
rampant

error
and
grammatical
gaffe
betrayed
his
feeling
one

his
tremble

and
flush

the
word
flow
out
in
a
final
letter
eisner
recapped
the
ovitz
tenure
at
disney
we
start
have
difference
right
from
the
begin
eisner
write
which
i
attribute
to
some
misguide
over
enthusiasm
you
start
off
slowly
with
which
i
believe
you
would
agree
you
be
nervous
and
want
to
impress
everybody
any
you
sic
would
agree
that
this
be
a
mistake
i
try
to
support
you
be
frustrate
by
you
and
want
to
help
inform
and
possibly
guide
you
by
january
i
be
really
concerned
about
our
relationship
the
most
reveal
part
of
eisner
dear
john
letter
come
at
the
end
you
may
think
that
so
much
of
what
i
have
write
in
this
letter
be
petty
he
confess
do
the
highly
literate
eisner
recognize
a
shakespearean
quality
to
this
debacle
two
men
bound
by
a
lengthy
friendship
both
brilliant
in
their
own
right
destroy
one
another
over
a
misfit
of
work
style
i
would
like
to
remain
friend
eisner
conclude
to
end
this
so
it
look
like
you
decide
it
and
to
be
positive
and
supportive
i
hope
we
can
work
together
now
to
accomplish
what
have
to
be
do
i
be
ready
to
work
as
hard
as
necessary
and
as
long
as
hard
and
as
long
as
necessary
that
be
to
get
ovitz
out
of
disney
with
the
minimum
amount
of
public
spectacle
despite
eisner
attempt
to
smooth
over
the
fire
ovitz
felt
betrayed
by
his
one
time
friend
i
be
cut
out
like
a
cancer
he
testify
in
court
i
guess
you
could
say
i
get
push
out
my
office
sixth
floor
window
in
a
memo
eisner
write
to
ovitz
he
say
the
high
the
position
of
the
person
make
the
mistake
the
more
interest
the
fall
and
the
far
the
fall
the
note
be
eerily
prophetic
and
maybe
even
sad
because
here
be
two
old
friend
in
the
high
position
whose
big
mistake
be
each
other
while
eisner
endure
these
embarrass
revelation
in
court
the
incredibles

become
another

in
its
first
weekend
the
big
single
international
weekend
in
history
pixar
have
prove
beyond
any
doubt
that
it
do
not
need
a
formula
and
that
the
pixar
magic
be
not
limited
to
one
or
two
brilliant
inhouse
talent
but
that
pixar
could
spot
brilliant
a
level
talent
like
brad
bird
on
the
outside
and
put
that
talent

extremely
important
give

his
vision
if
our
next
two
film
do
as
well
at
the
box
office
as
we
hope
we
project
that
pixar
will
have
between
million
and
billion
of
cash
in
the
bank
in
and
that
be
net
of
funding
percent
of
our
future
production
once
again
it
be
time
to
ask
michael
eisner
to
reopen
negotiation
and
rewrite
the
agreement
and
once
again
steve
be
cruelly
perfect
in
his
timing
in
the
aftermath
of
steve
january
break
off
of
negotiation
with
disney
report
in

colorful
lingo
of

kingdom
he
have
walk
away
follow
ten
month
of
sometimes
heat
talk
steve
needle
with
a
statement
that
say
it
be
a
shame
that
disney
wo
not
be
participate
in
pixar
future
success
the
statement
from
eisner
be
more
gracious
admire
the
wonderfully
creative
team
at
pixar
lead
by
john
lasseter
and
wish
them
much
success
in
the
future
disney
would
have
enjoy
continue
our
successful
collaboration
under
mutually
acceptable
term
the
statement
say
while
acknowledge
that
pixar
understandably
have
chosen
to
go
its
own
way
to
grow
as
an
independent
company
even
eisner
critic
have
to
acknowledge
that
the
use
of
the
word
understandably
show
that
he
recognize
the
good
sense
behind
steve
decision
at
that
point
pixar
five
film
have
earn
more
than
billion
at
the
worldwide
box
office
and
sell
over
million
dvd
and
video
while
it
might
be
difficult
to
sustain
especially
if
move
ahead
without
the
disney
partnership
the
company
have
achieve
a
remarkable
percent
annual
growth
in
revenue
yet
in
this
clash
of
the
titan
both
be
winner
and
both
be
loser
disney
loses
a
huge
amount
of
income
steve
loses
what
may
be
the
best
marketing
partner
of
all
time
the
clash
be
hardly
worth
the
cost
on
both
side
despite
eisner
conciliatory
part
word
job
and
eisner
have
behave
like
eisner
and
ovitz
shoot
poison
tipped
arrow
sling
rock
and
hurl
insult
it
be
as
if
the
two
men
need
a
fight
pixar
put
a
deal
on
the
table
that
be
almost
insult
to
disney
say
jordan
rohan
of
schwab
soundview
capital
market
steve
have
be
insult
so
many
time
that
he
could
not
resist
a
declaration
of
war
still
steve
victory
stance
have
its
bittersweet
component
he
john
lasseter
and
the
entire
pixar
team
will
suffer
the
indignity
of
watch
buzz
lightyear
and
woody
and
the
rest
of
the
toy
story
character
parade
through
a
toy
story
make
by
the
disney

of
the
contract
provision
that
all
right
to
produce
sequel
of
the
pixar
film
belong
to
disney
to
make
it
all
the
bad
eisner
as
if
look
for
a
way
to
drive
in
the
knife
as
deeply
as
possibleannounced
in
january
that
a
competition
have
be

with

be
a
novice
from
the
disney
write
program
a
novice
it
be
all
eerily
reminiscent
of
the
ovitz
eisner
feud
two
men
each
brilliant
in
his
own
right
clash
like
norse
god
in
a
wagnerian
opera
roy
disney
weigh
in
take
the
opportunity
for
another
attack
on
eisner
more
than
a
year
ago
he
say
we
warn
the
disney
board
that
we
believe
michael
eisner
be
mismanage
the
pixar
partnership
and
express
our
concern
that
the
relationship
be
in
jeopardy
in
the
end
steve
won
a
crucial
battle
eisner
will
step
down
a
year
earlier
than
plan
and
new
ceo
bob
iger
will
have
a
well
chance
of
get
the
pixar
disney
relationship
back
on
track
meanwhile
pixar
have
enough
money
in
the
bank
to
fund
its
next
several
production
without
disney
whatever
happens
in
the
future
whether
pixar
resume
its
dance
with
disney
or
chooses
another
dance
partner
it
will
be
steve
job
who
make
the
call
he
who
run
disney
run
a
giant
complex
of
business
but
that
do
not
make
him
the
king
of
animation
that
title
belongs
to
steve
job
never
mind
that
he
could
never
have
attain
such
an
exalt
post
except
on
the
shoulder
of
john
lasseter
steve

fare
no
well
wealth
success
and

do
not
bring
protection
from
the
same
plague
that
strike
ordinary
people
on
sunday
august
steve
job
sent
an
e
mail
to
friend
associate
and
employee
it
read
like
this
team
i
have
some
personal
news
that
i
need
to
share
with
you
and
i
want
you
to
hear
it
directly
from
me
this
weekend
i
underwent
a
successful
surgery
to
remove
a
cancerous
tumor
from
my
pancreas
i
have
a
very
rare
form
of
pancreatic
cancer
call
an
islet
cell
neuroendocrine
tumor
which
represent
about
percent
of
the
total
case
of
pancreatic
cancer
diagnose
each
year
and
can
be
cure
by
surgical
removal
if
diagnose
in
time
mine
be
i
will
not
require
any
chemotherapy
or
radiation
treatment
the
far
more
common
form
of
pancreatic
cancer
be
call
adenocarcinoma
which
be
currently
not
curable
and
usually
carry
a
life
expectancy
of
around
one
year
after
diagnosis
i
mention
this
because
when
one
hears
pancreatic
cancer
or
google
it
one
immediately
encounter
this
far
more
common
and
deadly
form
which
thank
god
be
not
what
i
have
i
will
be
recuperate
during
the
month
of
august
and
expect
to
return
to
work
in
september
while
i
be
out
i
have
ask
tim
cook
to
be
responsible
for
apple
day
to
day
operation
so
we
should
not
miss
a
beat
i
be
sure
i
will
be
call
some
of
you
way
too
much
in
august
and
i
look
forward
to
see
you
in
september
steve
he
add
a
p
s
that
show
he
have
not
lose
his
sense
of
salesmanship
or
his
sense
of
humor
p
s
i
be
send
this
from
my
hospital
bed
use
my
inch
powerbook
and
an
airport
express
while
some
thirty
two
thousand
case
of
pancreatic
cancer
be
diagnose
in
the
united
state
every
year
only
a
few
hundred
of
those
be
the
kind
that
steve
have
dr
robert
howard
an
oncologist
with
the
medical
center
of
the
university
of
california
at
los
angeles
say
the
pancreas
have
be
described
as
be
like
a
loaf
of
raisin
bread
in
this
analogy
the
bread
part
make
enzyme
for
digestion
and
other
function
the
islet
be
the
raisin
and
they
make
hormone
the
tumor
may
not
produce
any
symptom
while
still
small
it
be
often
detect
when
the
patient
have
an
mri
or
a
cat
scan
for
some
other
reason
or
begin
to
exhibit
symptom
such
as
abdominal
pain
an
oncologist
can
determine
with
outpatient
procedure
what
type
of
tumor
be
present
and
whether
it
be
benign
in
a
case
like
steve
the
result
come
as
a
great
relief
because
the
patient
learns
that
the
tumor
be
the
slow
grow
type
and
be
resectable
removable
by
surgery
the
surgery
do
not
need
to
be
schedule
on
an
emergency
basis
even
so
dr
howard
say
the
patient
would
ordinarily
be
wheel
into
the
operating
room
within
a
couple
of
week
or
a
month
when
the
tumor
be
caught
early
and
remove
completely
the
patient
be
likely
to
go
back
to
enjoy
a
normal
life
but
there

then
with
the

all
application
that

the
sense
of

that
most
mac
faithful
crave
itunes
be
the
next
stage
of

not
just
mac
but
also
pc
welcome
ipod
owner
from
any
operating
environment
into
the
apple
experience
as
part
of
this
steve
struck
a
deal
with
hewlett
packard
venerable
staid
hp
undergo
a
transformation
under
carleton
fiorina
that
would
soon

out
when
she
be
fire
to
sell
ipod
for
the
window
platform
with
the
hp
logo
although
hp
never
make
much
headway
it
show
that
steve
be
cover
all
the
base
it
be
a
modest
development
and
hardly
stir
any
attention
in
redmond
as
microsoft
roll
out
its
own
msn
network
and
a
couple
of
other
end
user
initiative
there
be
one
giant
difference
however
apple
service
be
consumer
orient
and
built
around
fun
thing
to
do
microsoft
lack
fun
appeal
and
be
utilitarian
quietly
and
without
draw
attention
to
itself
apple
have
set
up
the
structure
of
its
future
soon
safari
a
web
browser
from
apple
be
release
and
mac
machine
be
no
longer
dependent
on
microsoft
internet
explorer
to
browse
the
web
the
deal
that
steve
have
struck
when
he
return
to
apple
be
no
longer
so
important
all
of
this
be
collect
into
something
call
mac
dot
mac
a
membership
portal
that
offer
a
suite
of
service
include
online
hard
drive
storage
backup
and
automatic
software
upgrade
for
the
mac
community
then
come
ipod
nation
the
success
of
the
inexpensive
music
play
device
change
the
way
steve
thought
about
everything
while
apple
do
not
make
as
much
money
on
each
one
sell
as
it
do
on
its
high
end
g
computer
the
volume
of
sale
meant
that
by
the
end
of
the
company
first
fiscal
quarter
in
apple
idiosyncratic
to
the
end
have
a
fiscal
year
that
run
from
september
to
august
the
ipod
be
generate
as
much
cash
as
the
company
computer
steve
start
to
think
about
what
it
all
meant
we
live
in
an
era
where
more
and
more
of
our
activity
depend
on
technology
he
say
in
an
interview
early
in
we
take
our
photo
without
film
and
have
to
do
something
with
them
to
make
them
usable
we
get
our
music
over
the
internet
and
carry
it
around
in
digital
music
player
it
be
in
your
automobile
and
your
kitchen
apple
core
strength
be
to
bring
very
high
technology
to
mere
mortal
in
a
way
that
surprise
and
delight
them
and
that
they
can
figure
out
how
to
use
software
be
the
key
to
that
in
fact
software
be
the
user
experience
for
all
that
steve
want
to
be
a
broadscale
purveyor
of
digital
technology
however
traditional
pc
be
still
much
cheaper
and
microsoft
be
the
king
of
software
how
be
he
go
to
change
that
the
first
step
have
be
the
emac
an
integrate
mac
that
include
the
computer
with
a
monitor
in
one
package
add
a
keyboard
and
a
mouse
and
there
be
no
longer
any
computer
box
the
success
of
that
idea
a
stylish
evolution
of
what
constitute
a
personal
computerled
to
the
imac
g
line
these
be
flat
panel
all
in
one
computer
that
use
the
fast
processor
that
apple
have
and
integrate
everything
into
one
unit
they
be
very
successful
but
all
of
this
be
only
the
preamble
after
all
these
mac
be
still
more
expensive
than
comparable
pc
and
they
require
that
the
buyer
be
motivate
enough
to
pay
the
price
of
join
the
apple
universe
how
could
apple
combine
the
startle
success
of
the
ipod
with
the
ubiquity
of
the
internet
in
a
way
that
brought
people
who
have
be
introduce
to
apple
through
the
small
music
player
into
the
fold
this
be
the
issue
that
security
analyst
focus
on
with
laserlike
intensity
could
the
ipod
drive
sale
of
macintosh
computer
and
how
could
the
company
break
through
in
the
business
market
one
week
before
steve
walk
onstage
at
the
macworld
expo
in
january
the
company
quietly
introduce
two
crucial
piece
of
its
new
strategy
an
upgrade
to
the
xserve
high
power
mac
server
that
add
a
dual
processor
configuration
and
the
xsan
a
storage
area
network
system
the
former
provide
a
high
power
corporate
server
for
business
and
the
latter
a
disk
storage
system
for
business
that
be
price
extremely
aggressively
compare
to
microsoft
capable
system
from
company
like
dell
emc
and
network
appliance
with
these
two
product
apple
have
set
the
stage
for
a
corporate
cio
chief
information
officer
to
choose
apple
when
the
product
be
introduce
however
there
be
no
inkling
in
the
world
at
large
that
apple
would
try
to
change
the
face
of
business
compute
the
product
be
tout
as
perfect
for
provide
linux
base
compute
power
the
mac
have
long
be
the
gold
standard
for
people
who
favor
linux
the
opensource
operating
system
because
apple
o
x
operating
system
be
unix
base
and
therefore
a
close
fit
for
linux
and
it
offer
the
kind
of
vast
storage
that
be
necessary
for
video
edit
but
steve
have
something
more
in
mind
twenty
one
year
after
steve
introduce
the
macintosh
to
a
friendly
crowd
at
cupertino

twenty
one
year
earlier
he
have
worn
a
double
breast
pin
strip
suit
and
his
intensity
be
palpable
now
he
wore
a
black
t
shirt
and
jean
the
intensity
be
still
there
but
his
mood
be
very
different
he
be
almost
light
hearted
and
he
smile
a
lot
more
four
thousand
people
be
in
the
audience
many
in
overflow

they
have
to
watch

such
a

shorter
at
about
and
slighter
than

of
a
love
for
the

they
have

as
the
music

watch
sale

in
the

from
all
the
consumer
electronics
company
steve
have
start
to
turn
apple
into
a
medium
and
content
company
a
consumer
giant
in
music
while
pixar
have
already
do
that
for

in
fact
steve

footage
television
show
and
music
video
to
the
tiny
screen
on
an
ipod
in
some
way
it
be
a
curious
announcement
because
instead
of
the
ipod
itunes
combination
that
make
most
of
the
world
popular
music
available
to

this
seem
like
a
hastily
put
together
deal
there
be
only
a
smatter
of
content
but
the
content
that
be
available
be
very
important
in
more
way
than
one
at
the
announcement
disney

and
the

after

understood
that
the
way
to
steve
heart
pass
through
cupertino
suddenly
everyone
else
want
on
the
bandwagon
the
movie

be
drag
its
heel
for
year
about

suddenly
be
agog
with
the
possibility
within
day
all
sort
of
show
be
available
along
with
plenty
of
old
content
and
the

broken
in
the
come
month
cell
phone
company
search
engine
and
cable
company
all
start
to
offer
digital
video
content
in
various
way
while
it
be
by
no
mean
clear
that
apple
be
go
to
be
the
sole
winner
this
time
in
the
way
it
have
corner
the
digital
music
market
steve
have
pull
off
the
near
impossible
he
be
even
more
of
a
medium
darling
than
he
have
be
before
at
the
january
macworld
expo
he
announce
intel
base
machine
six
month
earlier
than
schedule
another
indication
of
the
new
apple
where
speed
to
market
have
become
more
important
than
relentless
retool
not
only
have
the
company
delighted
the
public
with
new
ipod
product
surprised
the
technorati
by
switch
to

flummoxed
the

by
get
its
stock
to
double
again
after
the
split
to
a
share
that
month
but
apple
have
become
a
different
kind
of
company
at
the
quarterly
earnings
call
that
month
steve
announce
that
apple
first
quarter
fiscal
result
profit
have

the
same
quarter
a
year
earlier
and
revenue
have
risen
more
than
percent
even
more
incredibly
the
company
sell
million
ipod
versus
million
a
year
earlier
music
sale
ipod
and
itunes
combine
comprise
percent
of
the
company
revenue
sale
of
mac
be
up
a
respectable
percent
but
the
ipod
tail
be
wag
the
apple
dog
in
a
very
real
way
apple
be
no
longer
a
computer
company
it
be
a
music
company
a
digital
medium
giant
be
there
any
other
frontier
that
steve
job
could
conquer
the
answer
would
not
be
long
in
come
within
day
a
bombshell
land
in
the
entertainment
industry
disney
be
try
to
buy
pixar
in
its
entirety
in
a
blink
steve
job
become
the
big
individual
shareholder
of
a
brand
name
know
by
more
people
around
the
world
than
almost
any
other
an
icon
of
the
entertainment
industry
disney
and
it
would
promote
him
from
billionaire
to
billionaire
severaltimes
over
his
personal
share
of
the
deal
at
the
go
stock
price
would
come
to
billion
year
earlier
when
steve
have
regain
a
foothold
in
apple
he
waste
little
time
in
building
relationship
with
key
board
member
oust
the
ceo
and
instal
himself
in
the
seat
of
power
now
that
coup
look
as
if
it
might
turn
out
to
be
merely
practice
for
achieve
a
vastly
big
crown
use
his
new
leverage
to
control
the
walt
disney
company
make
him
one
of
the
most
powerful
men
in
hollywood
ruling
over
a
domain
of
the
disney
studio
the
abc
tv
network
theme
park
all
over
the
world
cable
channel
merchandising
and
toy
even
mickey
mouse
the
possibility
be
breathtaking
and
perhaps
steve
have
best
even
bill
gate
but
in
this
seductive
and
glamorous
new
world
will
apple
have
to
play
second
fiddle
steve
job
at
age
fifty
have
make
himself
into
an
icon
of
three
different
industry
yet
at
time
it
seem
as
if
he
be
only
just
get
start
he
have
not
change
fundamentally
he
be
still
the
same
aggressive
opinionated
driven
creator
who
inspires
people
around
him
to
reach
unimaginable
height
and
destroys
the
fragile
ego
of
those
whose
skin
be
too
thin
to
handle
his
abrupt
barb
and
relentless
question
yet
now
he
be
a
middle
age
man
with
three
kid
at
home
and
a
world
of
experience
behind
him
he
be
warmer
richer
more
forgive
and
more
understand
but
on
reach
fifty
he
be
still
the
same
man
he
always
be
turn
fifty
make
us
look
far
ahead
but
it
do
not
make
us
more
patient
he
say
you
know
well
what
question
to
ask
there
be
not
enough
good
people
to
do
everything
you
want
to
do
so
now
we
chew
on
thing
for
a
while
before
we
decide
to
have
the
a
team
go
after
something
that
be
not
the
same
as
be
more
patient
patience
be
a
quality
that
no
one
will
see
in
steve
a
legion
of
admirer
a
world
of
investor
a
universe
of
music
lover
an
audience
of
moviegoer
and
a
generation
of
digital
kid
be
impatient
to
see
what
world
he
will
conquer
next
so
be
he
