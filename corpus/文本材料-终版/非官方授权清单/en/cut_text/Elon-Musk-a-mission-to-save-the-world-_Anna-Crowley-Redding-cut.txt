with
all
the
trapping
of

success
if

could
spend
time
with
this
man
study
him
try
to
get
in
his
head
well
then
downey
could
nail
the
role
that
man
be
elon
musk
at
thirty
five
year
old
elon
have
already
amass
a
fortune
and
be
well
on
his
way
to
become
one
of
the
most
powerful
people
in
the
world
with
company
like
paypal
tesla
and
spacex
he
push
technology
to
the
limit
until
he
force
innovation
and
breakthrough
make
his
mark
on
three
of
the
big
industry
that
exist
banking
automobile
and
space
his
ambitious
idea
be
so
far
out
that
people
often
laugh
at
him
until
they
didn
t
usually
because
he
d
accomplish
the
impossible
tbh
like
tony
stark
elon
also
found
time
to
make
the
round
in
hollywood
s
most
glamorous
social
scene
to
be
super
clear
elon
explain
to
a
telegraph
reporter
that
he
be
merely
percent
playboy
the
other
percent
elon
put
firmly
in
the
engineer
category
in
robert
downey
jr
give
elon
a
call
and
soon
found
himself
walk
around
spacex
headquarters
with
elon
himself
observe
talk
and
pick
elon
s
brain
that
time
allow
downey
to
perfect
the
role
check
it
out
in
the
next
installment
of
marvel
s
big
screen
franchise
iron
man
elon
would
even
have
a
cameo
elon
musk
s
cameo
in
iron
man
marvel
studio
that
say
there
be
a
major
divergence
between
elon
and
the
comic
book
character
tony
stark
s
script
come
with
a
slick
backstory
child
prodigy
and
heir
apparent
of
famed
entrepreneur
accomplishes
one
incredible
feat
after
another
and
then
take
the
helm
of
his
father
s
company
and
push
it
to
the
next
level
and
beyond
elon
s
backstory
be
far
from
slick
his
childhood
be
dark
painful
and
brutal
elon
have
to
endure
both
emotional
torment
at
home
and
physical
attack
at
school
as
a
bully
schoolboy
in
pretoria
south
africa
he
be
not
an
heir
apparent
he
be
not
a
medium
darling
in
wait
no
elon
be
simply
try
to
survive
daydream
and
nightmare
as
a
little
boy
in
south
africa
it
be
obvious
from
the
time
elon
could
speak
and
toddle
around
that
he
be
different
elon
s
mom
maye
musk
recognize
her
son
s
intelligence
straightaway
he
seem
to
understand
thing
quicker
than
other
kid
she
say
but
she
notice
something
else
too
something
about
elon
s
behavior
that
concerned
her
elon
would
suddenly
stare
off
in
the
distance
fall
into
a
daydream
so
deep
so
trancelike
that
no
one
could
get
his
attention
it
could
happen
mid
conversation
or
in
the
middle
of
a
busy
room
his
mother
be
worried
do
elon
have
a
massive
hearing
loss
shuffle
him
off
to
doctor
after
doctor
maye
try
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
the
doctor
saw
it
too
he
sometimes
seem
lose
in
another
world
that
no
one
could
penetrate
elon
endure
test
after
test
finally
his
doctor
schedule
him
for
surgery
the
plan
be
to
remove
his
adenoid
and
hope
elon
would
hear
well
adenoid
adenoid
be
part
of
the
immune
system
in
infant
and
young
child
seat
at
the
back
of
the
nasal
passageway
close
to
the
ear
the
adenoid
job
be
to
help
the
body
tackle
virus
and
other
germ
as
they
enter
the
body
but
sometimes
in
fight
infection
they
swell
usually
once
the
germ
be
dealt
with
they
shrink
back
to
normal
but
if
the
adenoid
become
too
big
or
infect
they
can
block
the
eustachian
tube
and
even
affect
hearing
but
the
surgery
have
no
impact
at
all
that
s
when
they
discover
his
hearing
be
actually
fine
it
be
his
mind
elon
be
simply
so
deep
in
thought
so
focus
on
his
idea
immerse
in
every
detail
that
he
detach
from
the
rest
of
the
world
it
be
as
if
a
movie
be
play
out
before
his
eye
allow
elon
to
visually
puzzle
out
a
problem
like
daydream
on
steroid
he
could
not
only
see
idea
but
run
virtual
test
on
them
too
it
seem
as
though
the
part
of
the
brain
that
s
usually
reserve
for
visual
processing
the
part
that
be
use
to
process
image
come
in
from
my
eye
get
take
over
by
internal
thought
process
elon
explain
to
biographer
ashlee
vance
i
can
t
do
this
as
much
now
because
there
be
so
many
thing
demand
my
attention
but
as
a
kid
it
happen
a
lot
that
large
part
of
your
brain
that
s
use
to
handle
incoming
image
get
use
for
internal
think
that
be
not
the
only
personality
trait
of
elon
s
that
stood
out
from
an
early
age
a
penchant
for
break
rule
and
break
them
boldly
with
commitment
drive
and
flair
land
six
year
old
elon
in
some
pretty
hot
water
with
his
mother
it
all
start
when
elon
s
mom
ground
him
she
make
his

perfectly
clear
elon
would
not
be
allow
to
go
to
his
cousin
s
birthday
party
and
elon
s
reaction
be
also
perfectly
clear
stay
at
home
when
his
young
brother
and
sister
be
go
to
the
party
no
way
absolutely

to
get
around

there
elon
let
his
mother
know
in
no
uncertain
term
that
he
would
most
certainly
be
at
the
party
he
didn
t
need
her
to
drive
him
there
he
would
ride
his
bike
all
by
himself
elon
recount
this
story
in
an
auditorium
full
of
people
at
the
computer

museum
the
crowd
hung
on
his
every
word
as
he
explain
that
tell
his
mother
be
a
critical
mistake
because
as
soon
as

divulge
his
plan
his
mother
look
at
her
son
and
fibbed

year
old

option

saw
it
his
mom
have
all
three
kid

they
add

and
other
job
to
their
grow
list
of

that

combine
with
what
elon
be
reading
his
ability
to
visualize

and
his

intelligence
meant
he
quickly
understood
complicate
task
and
engineering
concept
in
a
way
that
felt
innate
obvious
what
s
very
difficult
for
others
be
easy
for
me
for
a
while
i
thought
thing
be
so
obvious
that
everyone
must
know
this
he
say
like
how
the
wiring
in
a
house
work
and
a
circuit
breaker

alternate
current

amp
and

be
how
to
mix

knew
this
there
be

the
travel
errol
take

seem
to
take
place
in
the
united

if
the

evil
then
the
backdrop
for
that
battle
the
stage
for
those
save
the
world
confrontation
be
america
plain
and
simple

elon
never
waver
from
that

it
would
tend
to
be
in
the

more
broadly
north

so
i
want
to

where
the
cut
edge

be
he

and
if
elon
stayed

t
have
an

with
serve

serve
in

suppress
black
people
just
didn
t
seem
like
a
really
good
way
to
spend
time
elon
explain
but
how
could
he
just
move
to
another
country

start
a
new
life
and
specifically
how
could
he
just
move
to

to
live
study
and
work
he
be
south
african
not
american
immigration
law
didn
t
allow
you
to
just
show
up
and
put
down
stake
think
it
over
elon
s
attention
turn
to
his
mother
though
she
move
to
south
africa
at
a
young
age
she
be
actually
canadian
and
her
father
be
american
could
elon
get
citizenship
through
his
grandfather
that
hope
be
quickly
dash
because
his

do
not
hold
an
american
passport
research
immigration
law
elon
kept
look
for
a
solution
perhaps
he
couldn
t
move
directly
to
america
but
what
about
canada
elon
reason
that
if
he
receive
a
canadian
passport
it
would
be
easy
to
eventually
immigrate
to
the

dig
around
in
the
detail
of
citizenship
law
seventeen
year
old
elon
found
a
way
out
of
south
africa
because
his
mother
be
born
in
canada
her
child
be
eligible
for
canadian
citizenship
all
he
need
her
to
do
be
fill
out
the
paperwork
to
get
her
canadian
passport
and
then
he
could
get
one
too
elon
fill
out
the
form
and
immediately
put
them
in
the
mail
after
nearly
a
year

this
be
no
small
thing
in
when
elon
make
this

there
be
no

really
you
couldn
t

in
fact
if
you
want
to
travel
you
usually
turn
to
a
professional

but
elon
do
not
have
that
resource
his
father
wasn

funding
this
adventure
he
d
only
pay
for
school
in
south

if
elon
be
go
to
make
it
in

it
out
himself
what
to
do
where
to
settle
and
how
to

for
it
seal

maye
sent
a
letter
to
her

it
would
be
great
if
elon
could
stay
with
him
she
wait
for
a

by
the
time
elon

take
off
for
canada
she
have
not
heard
back
elon

backup

at
that

a

what
they
could
get
in
a

he
explain
to
a
reporter
and
if
people
ran

he
could

up
for
an
ice
cream
only
she
didn
t
show
she
be
too
busy
study
so
he
found
out
through
friend
what
flavor
ice
cream
she
like
best
and
then
he
deliver
it
to
her
as
she
sat
behind
a
pile
of
book
in
the
student
center
and
he
do
not
stop
there
he
sent
rose
book
since
she
want
to
be
a
writer
justine
be
swept
off
her
foot
and
the
two

be
big
in
business
you
well
learn
from
the
people
already
run
big
company
and
so
they
start
by
make
a

people
scour
the
newspaper
they
jot
down
the

maker
and
then
they

nicholson
s

the
executive
be
so
impressed
that
he
offer
elon
a
summer
internship
that
summer
as
elon
not
only
toil
away
at
his
intern
level
responsibility
he
also
soak
in
every
detail
of
banking
that
he
could
and
that
information
didn
t
sit
idle
in
his
head
elon
analyze
it
and
sum
up
the
entire
banking
industry
with
fresh
eye
to
elon
bank
be
neither
nimble
nor
innovative
and
in
his
opinion
their
lack
of
fresh
original
think
in
their
business
be
actually
cost
them
money
in
miss
opportunity
all
the
bank
do
be
copy
what
everyone
else
do
if
everyone
else
ran
off
a
bloody
cliff
they
d
run
right
off
a
cliff
with
them
if
there
be
a
giant
pile
of
gold
sit
in

and
nobody
be
pick
it
up
they
wouldn
t
pick
it
up
either
he
say
elon
also
learn
the
more
pedestrian
lesson
of
work
in
a
real
office

no

an

elon

his

his
entrepreneurial
spirit
thrive
and
so
too
do
his
study
he
pursue

degree
one
in
economics
from
the
wharton

and
the
other
in
physic
turn
in
paper
about
solar
energy
digitize
book
and
new
breakthrough
in
energy
storage
these
be
very
forward
think
idea
that
he
want
to
develop
and
explore
in
the
s
solar
energy
be
not
at
the
top
of
the
average
person
s
mind
the
world
be
still
fixate
on
oil
and
climate
change
wasn
t
a
topic
of
dinner
conversation
in
most
home
google
who
eventually
start
a
massive
book
digitization
project
would
not
even
be
a
company
for
four
more
year
and
yet
elon
have
delve
into
these
topic
with
an
ability
not
only
to
understand
them
but
to
turn
them
into
business
plan
as
elon
start
think
about
what
he
would
do
after
college
where
he
want
to
make
a
difference
these
idea
be
very
much
on
his
mind
i
thought
about
what
be
the
area
that
would
most
affect
the
future
of
humanity
in
my
opinion
the
three
area
be
the
internet
sustainable
energy
and
space
exploration
but
in
theory
you
can
t
work
on
all
those
thing
at
the
same
time
right
so
elon
picked
one
sustainable
energy
and
he
narrow
that
down
to
electric
car
he
focus
on
battery
storage
for
electric
vehicle
after
all
if
electric
car
be
go
to
travel
great
distance
like
say
to
the
next
town
or
have
enough
juice
for
an
entire
day
of
errand
the
battery
need
to
improve
his
attention
turn
to
capacitor
which
be
more
powerful
to
be
sure
but
couldn
t
store
more
energy
unless
there
be
a
technological
breakthrough
in
that
case
capacitor
could
get
really
interest
and
elon
saw
the
potential
for
just
such
a
breakthrough
warn
if
you
be
planning
to
ask
elon
about
capacitor
be
prepared
he
can
go
on
about
them
at
the
drop
of
a
hat
with
an
absurd
level
of
technical
detail
and
something
else
sheer
delight
so
the
area
that
i
be
study
be
advanced
capacitor
so
essentially
capacitor
that
have
an
energy
density
exceed
that
of
battery
because
they
have
a
very
high
power
density
but
a
low
energy
density
he
say
in
an
interview
with
no
note
so
obviously
if
you
could
make
a
capacitor
that
have
anywhere
near
the
energy
density
of
a
battery
with
this
incredibly
high
power
density
and
its
quasi
infinite
cycle
and
calendar
life
then
you
d
have
an
awesome
solution
for
energy
storage
and
mobile
application
now
try
to
say
that
three
time
fast
even
so
that
breakthrough
be
a
major
if
and
the
path
to
success
be
not
guaranteed
and
elon
wasn
t
sure
success
be
even
a
possibility
as
he
say
year
later
in
an
interview
when
you
embark
on
something
it
s
desirable
to
figure
out
if
success
be
at
least
one
of
the
possibility
because
for
sure
failure
be
one
of
the
possibility
he
want
to
get
this
right
it
be
his
future
require
him
to
invest
load
of
precious
time
year
could
go
by
and
if
you
picked
the
wrong
thing
well
you
didn
t
get
that
time
back
he
thought
the
idea
and
research
would
probably
make
a
great
topic
for
a
dissertation
but
what
good
would
that
do
in
the
end
so
you
add
some
leaf
to
the
tree
of
knowledge
he
say
laugh
and
the
leaf
be
nope
it
s
not
possible
that
would
be
a
bummer
and
elon
s
drive
center
on
make
a
meaningful
contribution
to
humanity
it
be
a
lot
to
think
about
and
he
need
more
information
luckily
as
his
final
college
summer
arrive
in
he
have
two
internship
set
up
in
silicon
valley
a
massive
dose
of
real
world
experience
work
every
wake
hour
elon
spent
his
day
focus
on
ultracapacitors
for
electric
car
at
a
company
call
pinnacle
research
institute
then
at
the
end
of
that
shift
he
head
to
his
job
at
the
video
game
maker
rocket
science
at
the
end
of
the
summer
it
be
time
to
have
a
long
conversation
about
what
he
learn
what
he
experienced
and
what
he
want
to
do
next
and
there
be
no
well
format
for
that
conversation
than
a
good
old
fashion
road
trip
with
kimbal
the
two
brother
bought
a
beater
to
be
fair
it
be
a
bmw
but
it
be
also
twenty
year
old
and
not
in
awesome

the

elon
start
think
back
to
his
internship
there
be
this
super
awkward
moment
that

out
a
guy

up
at
the

a
yellow

salesman
throwback
let
your
finger
do
the
walk
that
be
the
catchphrase
for
an
advertising
powerhouse
call
the
yellow
page
the
yellow
page
be
a
giant
phone
book
full
of
listing
of
business
phone
number
and
address
crack
open
the
hefty
paperback
you
could
thumb
through
to
the
right
page
and
then
drag
your
finger
down
the
column
until
you
land
on
the
business
you
be
hunt
for
thus
let
your
finger
do
the
walk
if
your
roof
have
a
leak
there
be
no
internet
to
turn
to
for
customer
rating
of

company
you
open
up
the
yellow
page
and
picked
one
from
the
listing
you
could
get
a
free
alphabetical
listing
of
your
business
but
if
you
want
even
more
attention
you
could
spend
big
buck
on
an
ad
that
fill
a
little
slice
of
the
page
or
even
a
whole
page
if
you
could
afford
it
and
the
phone
company
give
all
of
their
customer
a
free
copy
of
the
phone
book
which
make
it
a
very
popular
place
to
advertise
so
elon
watch
the

rep
fumble
his
way
through
a
pitch
on
all
the
different
option
for
listing
ad
and
rate
and
then
a
sort
of
verbal
train
wreck
unfolded
when
the
guy
have
to
get
through
his
spiel
about
a
brand
new
option
an
online
listing
sorcery
this
be
the
s
the
web
be
in
its
infancy
even
national
news
outlet
struggle
to
explain
it
to
their
viewer
and
this
salesman
clearly
didn
t
understand
it
either
but
elon
get
it
sure
there
may
not
have
be
a
lot
of
web
page
yet
and
connect
to
the
web
be
super
clunky
usually
over
a
hard
wire
phone
line
but
as
elon
and
kimbal
be
talk
about
this
yellow
page
incident
they
suddenly
have
an
idea
what
if
you
could
offer
business
online
listing
that
be
connect
directly
to

could
find
a

see
where
the
business
be
locate
and
get
turn
by
turn
direction
remember
this
be
long
before
google

so
it
be
a
very
forward
think
concept
ready
to
make
their
mark
on
the
internet
elon

miss
its
chance
to
snap
up
elon
musk
elon

he
never

someone
in

and
r
sum
in
hand
head
straight
for

but
elon
only
make
it
as
far
as
the

his
nerve
take
over
and
he
turn
around
and
walk
out

door
today

after
all
this
be

they
hire
a
marketing
firm
to
help
brainstorm
a
well

a
problem
you
head

difficult
and
a
little
spooky
a
far
cry
from
the
brick
and
mortar
experience
first
your
option
be
limited
you
could
write
a
check
and
put
it

someone
your

just
hop
you

biggie
you
could
type
your
credit
card
number
into
your
computer
and
check
out
online
no
people
involve
at
all
that
be
a
leap
many
be
not
ready
to
take
even
the
bank
themselves
be
not
sure
how
to
solve
this
problem
for

this
be
no
surprise
to

remember
his
college

where
he
learn
not
to

where

picked
up
his
opinion
that
the

be
not
on
the
cut
edge
of
new
technology
or

incredibly
frustrate

for

he
begin
contemplate
what
to
do
with

he

the
more
elon

about
it
and
study
it
the

in

you

well
to

you

this

pull
together
these

tell
us
about
the

that
kind

complex
problem
those
kind
of
stake
and
the
herculean
effort
require
to
save
the
day
well
elon
be
no
stranger
to
that
plot
he
have
read
it
over
and
over
again
in
hundred
maybe
even
thousand
of
science
fiction
novel
and
comic
as
a
kid
couple
that
with
an
education
in
physic
experience
run
a
company
and
confidence
elon
be
ready
for
takeoff
oasis
so
now
what
that
be
sort
of
the
crux
of
the
conversation
that
elon
have
with
his
old
college
roommate
nightclub
partner
in
crime
adeo
ressi
they
have
spent
the
weekend
in
new
york
s
ritzy
long
island
playground
the
hampton
drive
back
to
manhattan
they
be
shoot
the
breeze
about
the
whole
mar
thing
at
first
adeo
thought
elon
be
kid
but
by
the
end
of
the
ride
it
be
clear
that
elon
be
most
certainly
not
joking
elon
need
more
information
he
dove
headfirst
into
a
pile
of
book
when
he
wasn
t
reading
about
space
mar
or
how
to
get
there
he
be
call
up
the
world
s
lead
aerospace
expert
and
hound
them
with
question
he
turn
to
nasa
make
sense
right
the
national
aeronautics
space
agency
be
synonymous
with
all
thing
space
after
all
this
be
the
agency
that
put
human
on
the
moon
i
be
try
to
figure
out
why
we
d
not
sent
any
people
to
mar
because
the
obvious
next
step
after
apollo
be
to
send
people
to
mar
scour
nasa
s
website
he
found
nothing
and
that
really
shock
him
but
to
understand
why
nasa
wasn
t
run
full
throttle
on
a
crewed
mission
to
mar
you
have
to
revisit
moment
like
what
happen
on
january
seven
crew
member
wave
as
they
board
the
space
shuttle
challenger
in

canaveral

the

fascinate
because
one

the

be
a
schoolteacher
christa

across
the

television
be

so

could
watch
the

none
be

he
met
other

sought
out
as
much
information
as
he
could
he
broke
down
the
human
stuck
on
earth
issue
into
small
problem
to
solve
at
the
top
of
the
list
get
the
public
s
support
as
his
reading
research
and
connection
begin
to
coalesce
he
form
a

mar

this

it

have
a
master

degree
in
aeronautics
and
astronautics
and
a
doctorate
in
nuclear
engineering
i
come
up
with
this
idea
to
do
so
call
mar
oasis
which
be
to
send
a
small
greenhouse
with
seed
in
dehydrate
gel
that
upon

you
hydrate
the

you
have
green
plant

a

he
explain
the
public
responds
to
precedent
and
superlative
so
it
would
be
the
first
life
on
mar
the
furthest
that
life
s
ever
travel
and
you
d
have
this
money
shot
of
green
plant
on
a
red
background
despite
be
an
engineer
an
internet
guy
an
entrepreneur
who
could
rattle
off
obscure
detail
about
any
subject
he
study
elon
also
have
the
gift
of
find
way
to
rally
the
public
behind
his
goal
and
he
understood
the
power
behind
an
image
a
single
image
could
change
the
public
s
mind
focus
and
fill
their
courage
reservoir
and
with
those
horrify
and
spectacular
space
disaster
there
would
be
no
go
to
mar
without
tremendous
courage
now
he
have
to
look
at
his
bank
account
and
figure
out
if
he
could
afford
it
use
his
own
money
he
decide
that
he
be
willing
to
spend
half
of
it
even
if
the
whole
thing
fail
elon
knew
it
be
a
gamble
after
all
the
aerospace
industry
choke
down
million
of
dollar
as
a
midmorning
snack
it
be
a
crumb
a
token
but
if
the
result
be
that
the
public
start
think
about
space
exploration
again
get
excite
about
it
he
would
count
that
as
a
win
and
if
the
bad
that
could
happen
be
lose
money
he
could
stomach
it
so
he
get
to
work
first
he
need
to
buy
some
rocket
and
they
weren
t
cheap
the
boeing
delta
ii
would
have
cost
sixty
five
million
dollar
each
elon
say
and
he
want
two
and
then
i
be
like
whoa
okay
that
break
my
budget
right

thousand

from

elon
found
himself
sit
in
a
room
with
pad
wall
it
be
not
a
mental
hospital
this
be
where
the
russian
have
brought
him
to
talk
rocket
you
talk
to
people
who
know
people
and
pretty
soon
you
be
talk
to
the
russian
rocket
force
he
say
elon
have
board
a

and
flown
to

to
buy
a
couple
of
icbm
intercontinental

not
just
any
icbm
but
the
large
one
in
the
russian

he
hop
to
snap
them
up
for
million
apiece
they
thought
i
be
a
bit
crazy
but
then
they
read
about
paypal
and
say
okay
he
s
crazy
but
he
have
money
elon
say
he
brought
adeo
ressi
along
as
well
as
a
space
expert
he
d
gotten
to
know
while
study
mar
this
be
when
it
be
still
the
wild
west
over
there
adeo
explain
to
esquire
i
mean
there
be
like
dead
people
on
the
side
of
the
road
we
get
pull
over
multiple
time
at
gunpoint
and
have
to
bribe
the
police
no
reason
just
give
us
money
the
negotiation
require
a
second
and
third
trip
to
russia
but
in
february
that
third
meeting
change
elon
s
course
one
of
the
russian
begin
shout
at
elon
spit
fly
out
of
his
mouth
as
he
yell
it
be
a
strange
experience
he
say
laugh
at
the
memory
but
that
moment
bath
in
fly
spit
be
when
it
hit
him
the
price
of
the
rocket
be
silly
make
up
that
number
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
cost
of
actually
make
them
why
not
just
build
a
rocket
a
world
class
rocket
and
build
it
for
less
money
it
also
hit
him
that
america
s
will
be
not
the
problem
i
be
actually
wrong
about
my
first
premise
that
there
be
a
lack
of
will
in
fact
i
think
there
be
a
tremendous
amount
of
will
in
the
united
state
for
space
exploration
because
the
united
state
be
essentially
a
nation
of
explorer
he
explain
what
really
matter
be
have
a
way
i
need
to
work
on
the
way
as
elon
flew
back
to
the
united
state
he
take
all
the
information
he
have
consume
about
rocketry
space
propulsion
and
start
tap
away
on
his
computer
he
be
building
a
spreadsheet
to
figure
what
it
actually
cost
to
build
a
rocket
first
question
to
answer
why
be
rocket
so
expensive
then
what
be
the
material
i
need
to
build
a
rocket
what
s
the
most
cost
effective
way
to
do
it
how
should
it
be
design
where
be
the
part
make
if
you
say
a
rocket
be
make
of
aluminum
titanium
copper
carbon
fiber
elon
explain
you
can
break
it
down
and
say
what
be
the
raw
material
cost
of
all
these
component
and
if
you
have
them
stack
on
the
floor
and
could
wave
a
magic
wand
so
that
the
cost
of
rearrange
the
atom
be
zero
then
what
would
the
cost
of
the
rocket
be
elon
have
just
cross
over
from
buying
a
rocket
to
building
a
rocket
and
that
meant
he
need
to
quickly
become
an
expert
in
rocket
science
rocket
science
sure
he
d
blown
up
model
rocket
as
a
kid
and
then
receive
a
grown
up
physic
degree
but
it
be
not
a
degree
in
aeronautics
or
astronautics
once

elon

he

also
assemble
a

him
with
the

step
in

to
the

enable

soon
the

spacex

then
use
the

to

pay

a
sleek
look
with
shiny
concrete
floor
and
all
white
wall
it
may
seem
odd
that
i
would
start
spacex
with
an
expectation
of
failure
but
bear
in
mind
that
my
initial
thing
be
essentially
to
do
essentially
a
philanthropic
mission
with
zero
percent
chance

anything

you

well
you

rethink
everything
about
what
a

how
it
come

settle
on
the

path
forward
which
lead
to
start
a

would

problem
and
then
launch

about
it
this

elon

notice
i
thought
that
the
big
car
company
would
develop
electric
car
because
it
s
obviously
the
right
move
elon
explain
california
be
even
require
that
a
small
percentage
of
car
sell
be
pollution
free
by
so
when
the
large
car
company
in
the
world
debut
the
ev
in
elon
felt
sure
the
ev
and
would
come
next
he
couldn
t
have
be
more
wrong
when
lawsuit
force
california
to
relax
its
rule
in
carmaker
quickly
halt
production
of
electric
vehicle
but
they
do
not
stop
there
not
even
close
gm
recall
all
of
the
ev
s
and
crush
them
into
little
cube
elon
say
ev
customer
try
to
keep
their
car
they
even
sent
check
to
the
company
to
buy
them
but
gm
just
return
their
money
it
s
crazy
when
be
the
last
time
that
you
heard
about
any
company
s
customer
hold
a
candlelit
vigil
for
the
demise
of
that
product
he
pause
particularly
a
gm
product
his
mind
be
blown
elon
notice
something
else
devote
loyal
ev
customer
could
not
simply
buy
another
all
electric
car
there
wasn
t
anything
remotely
similar
on
the
market

one
at
the
smithsonian
national
museum
of
american
history
in
washington
d
c
and
what
make
it
super
insane
elon
say
in
an
interview
be
that
we
be
go
to
run
out
of
oil
anyway
it
s
not
like
there
be
some
infinite
oil
supply
we
be
go
to
run
out
of
it
so
we
know
we
have
to
get
some
sustainable
mean
of
transportation
no
matter
what
remember
elon
be
think
about
electric
car
all
the
way
back
in
college
in
fact
even
when
elon
be
linger
over
dinner
with
a
date
he
would
go
on
and
on
about
electric
car
it
probably
wasn
t
the
best
strategy
he
laughingly
admit
year
later
nope
but
clearly
that
passion
for
electric
car
ran
deep
and
now
elon
be
have
a
eureka
moment
there
need
to
be
a
new
car
company
that
come
in
and
show
that
it
can
be
do
he
say
that
meant
the
car
would
need
to
be
long
range
high
performance
and
look
great
and
just
like
with
rocketry
elon
start
ask
around
reading
and
explore
the
idea
in
his
mind
so
battery
cost
be
an
issue
but
as
elon
discover
new
advance
in
battery
technology
held
huge
promise
within
reach
that
be
the
case
he
wonder
be
there
room
for
new
think
on
how
to
make
electric
car
on
the
other
hand
elon
be
already
at
that
very
moment
um
take
on

both
the

impossible
since
i

i
knew
that
if
i
do
try
to
start
an
electric
car
company
and
run
it
it
would
be
extremely
painful
to
run
two

never
end
work
week
manage
two
different
staff

the
bad
problem
of
both

in
there
seem
to
be
another

it
go
without

that
elon
brought
some
heavyweight
engineering
and
entrepreneurial
chop
to
the

but
he
also
brought
connection
and
elon
be
connect
to
a
man
name
j
b
straubel

j
b
several
month
earlier
when
j
b
s
colleague
brought
him
along
to
help
pitch
an
idea
for
electric
aircraft
to
elon
at
lunch
j
b
happen
to
mention
his
own
groundbreaking
idea
at
this
point
electric
car
couldn
t
go
too
far
on
a
single
charge
you
could
drive
to
work
or
a
friend
s
house
but
an
electric
car
be
not
road
trip
material
j
b
have
an
idea
for
solve
that
problem
back
when
j
b
study
energy
system
engineering
at
stanford
university
he
convert
an
old
porsche
into
an
electric
car
and
promptly
set
a
world
record
for
electric
vehicle
acceleration
that
say
it
could
only
travel
a
distance
of
thirty
mile
fix
that
issue
become
j
b
s
obsession
after
college
j
b
s
day
job
be
work
on
motor
for
a
hybrid
car
company
and
then
he
move
on
to
work
for
a

develop
an
electric
power
plane
but
one
night
his
old
pal
from
the
stanford
solar
car
team
begin
gabbing
about
lithium
ion
battery
we
wonder
what
would
happen
if
you
put
ten
thousand
of
the
battery
cell
together
we
do
the
math
and
figure
out
you
could
go
almost
one
thousand
mile
j
b
say
this
be
the
idea
that
j
b
mention
to
elon
elon
love
it
and
so
after
his

urge
j
b
to
see
them
marc

turn
it
into
a
lab
for
tinker

his
face
show
the
evidence
of
his
lifelong
interest

big
company
and
move
on
it
s
that
last
part
that
weigh

during
that

how
to
move
on
what
to
do
next
rumble
along
endless
mile
of
open
road
elon
and
lyndon
be
brainstorming
to
pas
the
time
and
settle
on
a
plan
like
elon
lyndon
wasn
t
look
to
start
just
any
ol
company
he
want
to
do
something
that
make
a
difference
elon
have
an
idea
solar
energy
even
if
you
have
electric
car
you
have
to
have
the
other
side
of
the
equation
and
so
how
do
you
produce
energy
in
a
sustainable
way
elon
explain
and
the
answer
to
that
question
be
solar
elon
point
out
that
in
his
opinion
the
solar
industry
be
focus
on
tinker
with
and
improve
the
panel
s
technology
instead
of
solve
the
industry
s
big
challenge
how
to
get
solar
on
as
many
roof
as
possible
how
do
you
do
that
and
then
what
can
you
connect
them
create
solar
grid
and
manage
that
network
that
last
question
tie
into
the
rive
brother
expertise
lyndon
be
excite
and
start
talk
to
his
brother
peter
about
it

in
conversation
what
happens
if
a
strip
of
these
battery
catch
fire
so
what
do
engineer
at
a
cookout
do
when
this
kind
of
question
arises
why
they
set
them
on
fire
of
course
so
bottom
line
battery
cell

they
realize
they
need
to
find
a
way
to
keep
those
battery
cool
warn
solve
this
problem
involve
many
more
experiment
and
explosion
but
they
solve
it
also
do
not
be
tempt
to
amuse
yourself
by
set
battery
on
fire
it
be
extremely
dangerous
eventually
the
tesla
engineer
experiment
in
a
blast
area
maintain
by
the
fire
department
as
team
tesla
chase
down
nothing
less
than
the
complete

how
do
you
solve
a
problem
like
elon
elon
s
approach
to
problem
solve
come
from
his
reading
training
in
physic
and
engineering
experience
when
elon
need
to
figure
out
how
to
survive
on
his
own
in
canada
he
rely
on
lesson
learn
from
his
all
time
favorite
book
the
hitchhiker
s
guide
to
the
galaxy
a
key
theme
in
douglas
adam
s
classic
be
the
word
don
t
panic
it
mean
when
you
encounter
a
problem
challenge
or
obstacle
don
t
say
oh
crap
i
m
really
in
a
pickle
now
instead
say
here
s
a
problem
how
do
i
solve
it
remember
elon
first
read
this
book
while
try
to
determine
the
meaning
of
life
that
s
when
the
book
taught
him
another
lesson
in
problem
solve
you
have
to
figure
out
the
right
question
before
you
can
attempt
to
answer
it
likewise
if
you
start
with
an
answer
you
still
need
to
figure
out
the
question
once
elon
have
the
right
question
he
turn
to
an
idea
from
physic
call
first
principle
use
first
principle
you
boil
down
the
problem
to
its
most
basic
form
for
example
how
much
money
do
it
take
for
me
to
eat
every
day
or
what
do
it
really
cost
to
build
a
rocket
and
then
you
go
where
the
problem
solve
take
you
even
into
uncharted
territory
it
s
rare
that
people
try
to
think
of
something
on
a
first
principle
basis
elon
explain
they
ll
say
we
ll
do
that
because
it
s
always
be
do
that
way
or
they
ll
not
do
it
because
well
nobody
s
ever
do
that
so
it
must
not
be
good
but
that
s
just
a
ridiculous
way
to
think
you
have
to
build
up
the
reason
from
the
ground
up
from
the
first
principle
be
the
phrase
that
s
use
in
physic
you
look
at
the
fundamental
and
construct
your
reason
from
that
and
then
you
see
if
you
have
a
conclusion
that
work
or
doesn
t
work
and
it
may
or
may
not
be
different
from
what
people
have
do
in
the
past

be
the

now
he

it
preferably
without
blowing

elon
knew
the

inside
out
well
enough
he
say
to
redraw
the
whole
thing
without
the
blueprint
it
have
take
two
year
longer
than
elon
originally
hop
to
get
to
this
moment
but
the
moment
have
arrive
it
be
time
to
show
the

what

could
do

chronicle
the
unlikely
path
and
amaze
contribution
of
albert
einstein
a
book
that
elon
learn
a
lot
from
it
s
complicate
remember
when
elon
discover
that
the
price
of
rocket
be
overly
inflate
he
make
a
similar
discovery
about
the
part
use
to
make
rocket
they
be
way
overprice
elon
found
that
irritate
if
something
cost
penny
to
make
it
shouldn
t
cost
thousand
of
dollar
to
buy
what
do
elon
do
in
such
a
situation
make
the
part
himself
so
spacex
begin
manufacturing
its
own
and
just
like
tesla
would
not
simply
assemble
a
bunch
of
part
from
somewhere
else
into
a
car
at
the
tesla
factory
neither
would
spacex
the
rocket
company
would
make
as
many
of
the
part
as
it
could
which
would
continue
to
bring
the
cost
of
get
to
space
down
it
s
hard
to
overstate
just
how
much
this
approach
broke
new
ground
it
be
that
same
attitude
elon
have
always
have
of
not
go
along
with
the
status
quo
always
question
why
thing
be
the
way
they
be
and
if
there
wasn
t
a
good
answer
to
that
question
he
look
for
a
new
way
this
level
of
extreme
innovation
take
tremendous
intellectual
and
physical
energy
and
that
often
bumped
up
against
a
harsh
reality
there
be
only
twenty
four
hour
in
a
day
and
in
theory
you
be
suppose
to
sleep
for
some
portion
of
that
elon
try
to
get
six
hour
of
sleep
a
night
attach
to
his
smartphone
he
could
read
and
reply
to
e
mail
from
both
spacex
and
tesla
whether
be
chauffeur
to
the

she

elon
be
still
very
close

next
it

garner
international

remember
elon

so
they
not

need
to

they

handle
everything
traditional
car
could
include
long

three
hundred
mile
on
a
single

be
certainly
a

unless
you

or
even
from
los

to
san

to
solve
this
issue
tesla
decide
to
make

for
their
car
they
start
with
six
station
in
california
as
far
north
as
sacramento
where
tesla
owner
could
plug
in
midtrip
and
recharge
with
just
a
thirty
minute
stop
and
it
be
free
as
of
this
write
there
be
more

supercharger

throughout
north
america
asia
europe
and
the

tesla
also
offer

complete
with
en

location
as
more

tesla
begin

now
buyer
new
to
tesla
receive
a

for
some
free

every
year
which
amount
to
about
a
thousand
mile
of
range
once
the
credit
be
exhaust
in
a
year
they
pay
a
small
fee
for
each
charge
it
still
generally
work
out
to
be
cheaper
than

tesla
us
the
revenue
to
maintain

the

all
that
triumph
and
expansion
seem
an
unlikely
buildup
to
a
moment
of
national
humiliation
but
everyone
across
the

around
the

who

to
watch
the

well
in

romney

company
some
of
which

break
into
into
solar

to
solyndra

it
be
a
lot
but
in
elon
s
world
there
be
no
time
to
rest
in
fact
that
august
just
a
month
after
the

elon
be
announce
a
new
idea
for
get
around
the

as
he
put
it
a
fifth
mode
of
transportation
the
hyperloop
think
bullet
train
but
crash
proof
weatherproof
and
much
much
faster
he
felt
sure
you
could
take
a
hyperloop
from
downtown
los
angeles
to
downtown
san
francisco
in
thirty
minute
as
he
start
talk
about
the
idea
in
interview
people
would
sometimes
ask
if
he
be
serious
it
seem
outlandish
elon
be
serious
only
he
couldn
t
possibly
fit
that
in
and
yet
the
idea
have
the
potential
to
help
him
reach
his
ultimate
goal
of
get
human
off
of
gasoline
an
effort
that
couldn
t
wait
so
instead
of
start
another
company
to
chase
that
down
he
publish
a
public
paper
on
the
idea
spell
out
what
he
thought
be
possible
with
the
hope
that
others
in
the
tech
community
would
pick
up
the
idea
and
run
with
it
and
they
do
a
start
up
call

all
we

remember
back

that

the

this

the

ultimately

that

he
have
a

the

it
have

construction
of

the

will
consist
of
a

and
a
ship
that
can
carry
one
to
two
hundred
people
on

but
long
before
starship
attempt
to
take
the
first
colonist
to
mar
unmanned

mission
will
drop
off
those
critical
necessity
the
goal
be
to
deliver

by
starship
will
get
a
new
name
when
the

head
to

heart

which
be
the

concept

of
send
dragon
to
mar
spacex
after
launch
the
ship
carry
the
colonist
into
orbit
the
starship
s
booster
would
quickly
return
to
earth
load
up
on
fuel
and
rejoin
the
colonist
in
space
resupplying
the
ship
with
enough
fuel
to
make
it
to
mar
the
trip
would
take
about
eighty
day
spacex
say
the
target
date
for
crewed
mission
to
mar
be
elon
s
big
vision
be
that
spacex
will
take
a
million
people
to
mar
over
a
hundred
year
period
but
the
plan
be
constantly
evolve
as
technology
evolves
i
think
we
be
work
on
one
of
the
most
important
thing
we
possibly
can
and
that
s
to
find
another
place
for
human
to
live
and
survive
and
thrive
if
something
happen
on
earth
you
need
human
living
somewhere
else
spacex
president
gwynne
shotwell
say
round
trip
rocket
ticket
because
a
human
civilization
on
mar
be
an
idea
with
a
huge
price
tag
you
need
a
way
to
pay
for
it
elon
s
solution
develop
a
spacecraft
that
can
not
only
ferry
people
back
and
forth
to
mar
but
carry
out
a
number
of
other
job
like
launch
satellite
for
government
and
business
and
provide
transportation
from
earth
to
the
moon
starship
would
more
than
double
the
power
of
the
falcon
heavy
which
dramatically
increase
the
type
of
payload
the
spacecraft
can
carry
and
where
those
payload
can
be
deliver
it
could
place
much
large
satellite
and
telescope
into
space
give
scientist
the
opportunity
to
see
really
incredible
thing
and
discover
incredible
thing
in
space
gwynne
explain
in
a
recent
ted
talk
all
of
those
mission
would
bring
in
revenue
but
this
rocket
could
also
take
you
to
the
other
side
of
this
planet
in
just
forty
five
minute
true
space
age
travel
on
a
spaceship
that
can
take
you
from
one
point
on
earth
to
another
and
the
best
part
be
the
long
part
of
the
trip
will
be
the
boat
ride
to
and
from
the
land
pad
it
s
definitely
go
to
happen
gwynne
say
during
her
onstage
interview
if
i
can
do
this
trip
in
half
an
hour
to
an
hour
i
can
do
dozen
of
these
a
day
right
gwynne
explain
and
yet
a
long
haul
aircraft
can
only
make
one
of
those
flight
a
day
so
even
if
my
rocket
be
slightly
more
expensive
and
the
fuel
be
a
little
bit
more
expensive
i
can
run
ten
time
at
least
what
they
be
run
a
day
and
really
make
the
revenue
i
need
to
out
of
that
system
when
could
rocket
to
asia
become
a
real
thing
well
accord
to
gwynne
by
colonial
internet
okay
so
there
be
plan
in
place
for
get
to
and
for
colonize
the
red
planet
um
but
what
about
when
they
get
there
you
be
go
to
want
the
internet
available
to
keep
in
touch
with
earth
while
chill
or
engage
in
your
daily
fight
for
survival
on
mar
in
january
elon
announce
his
plan
to
develop
a
space
base
internet
call
starlink
the
first
step
be
provide
satellite
base
internet
for
all
of
earth
the
satellite
some
four
thousand
of
them
would
beam
down
broadband
internet
from
low
earth
orbit
the
price
tag
for
a
space
base
internet
billion
and
the
number
of
people
on
the
planet
who
would
have
improve
access
or
their
first
access
at
all
to
the
internet
roughly
three
billion
yeah
there
be
no
question
spacex
president
gwynne
shotwell
say
it
will
change
the
world
it
take
a
while
but
in
elon
finally
won
approval
from
the
federal
communication
commission
for
his
plan
to
build
a
global
broadband
network
use
spacex
satellite
elon
have
approval
to
launch
a
whop
satellite
to
create
his
starlink
network
when
elon
first
announce
the
project
he
make
his
ultimate
goal
clear
eventually
he
want
his
network
to
deliver
an
internet
to
mar
it
will
be
important
for
mar
to
have
a
global
communication
network
as
well
he
say
add
i
don
t
see
anyone
else
do
it
chapter
this
be
the
boring
bit
in
the
spring
of
gary
take
center
stage
for
a
big
talk
only
gary
be
a
snail
so
he
let
his
speed
do
the
talk
like
all
snail
he
be
slow
sluggish
even
so
gary
have
a
target
on
his
back
because
he
s
be
win
a
race
against
elon
musk
like
elon
gary
life
in
los
angeles
which
be
full
of
hollywood
star
people
who
want
to
become
hollywood
star
palm
tree
surfer
talent
agent
writer
and
traffic
epic
traffic
go
one
mile
in
one
hour
traffic
on
this
topic
elon
never
mince
word
so
right
now
i
think
one
of
the
most
soul
destroy
thing
be
traffic
he
say
during
a
ted
talk
it
affect
people
in
every
part
of
the
world
it
take
away
so
much
of
your
life
it
s
horrible
it
s
particularly
horrible
in
l
a
soul
destroy
elon
s
goal
be
to
solve
the
traffic
problem
by
boring
tunnel
under
big
city
then
after
the
tunnel
be
dug
you
need
something
to
zip
through
them
something
that
doesn
t
create
another
traffic
disaster
even
a
subterranean
one
his
solution
harks
back
to
that
high
speed
travel
idea
elon
have
year
ago
a
system
of
vacuum
tunnel
to
transport
people
and
vehicle
but
for
it
to
work
tunnel
dig
and
building
must
speed
up
by
a
factor
of
ten
what
s
this
get
to
do
with
gary
the
snail
hang
out
at
the
boring
company
a
subsidiary
of
spacex
found
to
bore
tunnel
for
high
speed
travel
gary
be
the
company
pet
kind
of
a
mascot
really
and
also
a
goal
what
s
the
spark
of
inspiration
for
gary
s
name
gary
the
snail
from
spongebob

the

s
gary
even

in

gary
the

the

gary
be
capable
of
go
fourteen
time
faster
than
a

boring
machine
elon
admit
explain
the
score
we
want
to
beat
gary
victory
will
be
beating
the

the

that
we
face

that
so
much
of

life
be
d
you
re
in
a
tall
building
or
in
a
dense
office
environment
and
then
we
go
to
this
d
plane
of
street
and
the
consequence
be
obvious
elon

at

you

lose
an

in

word
you
go
from
many
floor
of
office
space
down
to
a
lobby
and
out
to
a
single
layer
street
and
you
do
this
at
predictable
time
along
with
all
the
other
people
who
work
there
at
a

lunchtime
and
quittin
time
so
then
obviously
you
be
go
to
get
stuck
in
traffic
guaranteed
but
if
you
can
do
hundred
of
tunnel
and
you
can
have
many
small

woven
throughout
the

on
how
to
best
move
people

their

the
idea
be
to

that

there
s
no

limit
to
how
many
level
of

you
can
have
you
can
go
much
far
deep
than
you
can
go
up
elon
say
the
deepest
mine
be
much
deeper
than
the
tallest
building
be
tall
so
you
can
alleviate
any
arbitrary
level
of
urban
congestion
with
a
d
tunnel
network
this
be
a
very
important
point
bottom
line
this
idea
isn
t
about
dig
a
single
tunnel
to
fix

on
the

it
s
about
dig
as
many

they

until
travel

be
not
that
big
a

they
be
even
experiment
with
the

of
an

that
take
you
from

s
proposal
be
for
ton
of
small

no
big
than
a
couple
of
parking
space
but
to
pull
this
off
they
still
have
to
wrestle
with
the
speed
of
tunnel
boring
and
bring
new
technology
new
way
of

to
the

typically

be
built
construction
crew
must
drill
then
stop
then
remove
dirt
then
put
in

the

company
s
plan
center
on
continuous
drilling
and
place
reinforcement
segment
at
the
same
time
and
instead
of
lay
heavy
and
expensive
electrical
cable
in
mile
of
tunnel
to
power
the
boring
machine
the

machine
will
use
tesla
battery
pack
on

the

be
get

from
both

the

the

attempt
to
solve
the

problem
through
the

company
s
tunnel
transport
quest
elon
have
stumble
on
to
a
couple
of
other
solution
for
entirely
different
problem
your
backyard
pyramid
forty
two
be
the
answer
but
what
be
the
question
that
s
part
of
the
story
in
the
hitchhiker
s
guide
to
the

similarly
in
solve
one
problem
elon
sometimes
stumble
on
a
random
answer
and
then
he
look
for
the
question
it
happen
at
the
boring
company
and
the
answer
be
dirt
lot
and
lot
of
dirt
that
s
what
happens
when
you
dig
hole
right
you
end
up
with

of
dirt

if
dirt
be
the
answer
what
be
the

just
like
a
jeopardy
contestant
elon
come
up
with
the
question
what
be
a
cheap
ingredient
to
make
really
strong
brick
well
his
company
begin
mix
the
dirt
with
a
small
amount
of
concrete
then
it
compress
the
mixture
use
a
lot
of
pressure
which
make
really
strong
brick
in
fact
the
company
say
the
brick
meet
california
s
stringent
earthquake
code
it
be
possible
that
the
boring
company
will
offer
them
for
sale
for
construction
elon
say
he
s
even
toss
around
the
idea
of
make
life
size
lego
kit
with
the
brick
that
you
could
buy
and
construct
in
your
backyard
it
seem
like
a
fun
way
to
spend
an
afternoon
he
say
as
of
this
write
the
lego
like
kit
be
not
for
sale
but
elon
set
the
price
at
ten
cent
a
brick
well
below
what
other
brick
and
concrete
block
cost
and
while
use
the
brick
for
backyard
lego
sound
super
fun
he
be
quick
to
point
out
that
the
brick
could
potentially
be
use
to
build
affordable
housing
as
well
and
on
that
point
there

depress
because
california
taxpayer
be
go
to
be
on
the
hook
to
build
the
most
expensive
high
speed
rail
per
mile
in
the
world
and
the
slowest
he
say
those
be
not
the
superlative
you
want
so
he
begin
do
what
elon
do
break
down
transportation
to
its
fundamental
purpose
and
part
and
then
he
start
rearrange
those
ingredient
if
you
just
say
what
would
you
ideally
want
in
a
transportation
system
you
d
say
okay
well
you
d
want
something
that
relative
to
exist
mode
of
transportation
be
faster
let
s
say
twice
as
fast
cost
half
as
much
per
ticket
can
t
crash
be
immune
to
weather
and
you
can
make
the
whole
thing
self
power
with
solar
panel
what
could
do
that
his
answer
be
a
vacuum
tunnel
with
pod
that
travel
around
mph
why
a
vacuum
because
it
eliminates
air
friction
enable
the
pod
to
travel
at
much
great
speed
five
year
later
he
s
built
a
hyperloop
vacuum
tube
for
test
that
s
mile
long
and
six
foot
in
diameter
it
sits
right
outside
spacex
headquarters
and
test
pod
travel
at
speed
of
mph
brake
just
in
time
the
video
of
a
test
run
move
so
fast
that
before
elon
played
it
at
an
information
session
he
give
the
audience
a
seizure
warn
the
goal
be
to
get
the
test
pod
up
to
speed
over
mph
comparable
to
jet
only
a
pod
in
a
vacuum
won
t
have
the
same
physical
limitation
of
a
jet
we
don
t
really
have
mach
problem
we
aren
t
create
massive
sonic
boom
because
we
evacuate
the
air
elon
say
we
built
a
hyperloop
test
track
adjacent
to
spacex
just
for
a
student
competition
to
encourage
innovative
idea
in
transport
and
it
actually
end
up
be
the
big
vacuum
chamber
in
the
world
after
the
large
hadron
collider
by

student
be
design
potential
pod
yes
that
first
year
over
a
thousand
university
worldwide
enter
the
competition
the
proposal
be
narrow
down
to
twenty
and
the
student
test
their
design
at
spacex
the
fast
pod
that
can
stop
without
crash
win
in
the
win
pod
clocked
mph
in
december
the
boring
company
unveiled
a
mile
long
test
tunnel
plan
for
other
tunnel
be
underway
but
this
sneak
peek
feature
a
tesla
with
retractable
side
wheel
that
allow
a
model
x
to
drive
autonomously
directly
on
the
concrete
track
this
demo
be
more
of
a
proof
of
concept
to
give
people
an
idea
of
what
this
project
will
look
and
feel
like
when
it
come
to
life
there
be
still
more
work
to
be
do
and
problem
to
be
solve
but
the
test
tunnel
will
allow
for
ton
of
research
on
both
the
loop
and
the
hyperloop
the
hawthorne
test
tunnel
as
of
october
the
boring
company
earthquake
what
would
happen
in
the
tunnel
during
an
earthquake
expert
say
one
of
the
safest
place
to
be
during
an
earthquake
be
in
a
tunnel
seismic
motion
becomes
great
as
it
approach
the
surface
and
most
tunnel
be
reinforce
and
built
to
withstand
seismic
activity
and
as
with
loop
development
not
only
be
boring
company
employee
work
on
the
hyperloop
project
but
so
be
some
of
the
top
engineer
from
spacex
we
be
take
world
class
engineering
talent
apply
it
to
this
problem
and
see
if
we
can
make
some
headway
elon
say
ad
astra
this
latin
phrase
mean
to
the
star
but
it
be
also
the
name
of
a
private
school
that
elon
start
to
educate
his
five
boy
today
the
school
be
locate
inside
spacex
and
have
forty
student
there
be
no
grade
like
first
second
third
it
s
a
project
base
curriculum
that
strives
to
make
education
hand
on
and
take
advantage
of
kid
curiosity
while
get
them
comfortable
with
problem
solve
student
grapple
with
real
world
subject
like
robotics
and
artificial
intelligence
all
in
the
middle
of
a
rocket
factory
this
be
an
outside
the
box
school
this
concept
be
a
far
cry
from
what
elon
experienced
when
he
be
a
schoolboy
while
elon
easily
annihilate
math
even
math
beyond
his
grade
level
he
struggle
with
other
subject
like
south
africa
s
afrikaans
language
but
his
performance
have
to
do
more
with
philosophy
than
ability
i
just
didn
t
see
the
point
of
learn
that
it
seem
ridiculous
i
d
get
a
passing
grade
and
that
be
fine
elon
told
biographer
ashlee
vance
i
d
rather
play
video
game
write
software
and
read
book
than
try
and
get
an

there

the
big

that

face
this

for

elon

in
his
interview
with
roll
stone
i
keep
tell
people
this
i
hate
to
be
the

here
but
it
s
all
fun
and
game
until
somebody
loses
an
eye
artificial
intelligence
be
an
emerge
technology
so
the
precise
definition
will
change
as
its
development
and
use
be
well
understood
but
loosely
when
people
talk
about
general
artificial
intelligence
today
they
be
talk
about
computer
that
can
think
reason
and
learn
like
human
limited
or
task
specific
ai
us
computer
for
task
that
would
normally
require
human
being
such
as
analyze
medical
x
ray
or
translate
language
between
speaker
or
even
flip
hamburger
during
the
spring
of
elon
take
to
twitter
to
convince
people
to
watch
a
new
documentary
about
artificial
intelligence
do
you
trust
this
computer
it
be
produce
by
chris
paine
this
wasn
t
chris
s
first
documentary
in
the
filmmaker
produce
a
documentary
about
gm
s
ev
debacle
remember
the
car
that
be

then
take
back
and
crush
the
funeral
held
by
sad

the

he
then
follow
it
up
with
revenge
of
the

which
include
part
of
tesla
s
story
in
this
new
documentary
about
artificial

elon
outline
his
concern
we
be
rapidly
head
towards
digital
superintelligence
that
far
exceeds
any
human
and
i
think
it
s
very
obvious
he
say
and
to
elon
the
threat
to
human
be
obvious
too
ai
doesn
t
have
to
be
evil
to
destroy
humanity
elon
far
explain
if
ai
have
a
goal
and
humanity
just
happens
to
be
in
the
way
it
will
destroy
humanity
as
a
matter
of
course
without
even
think
about
it
no
hard
feeling
it
s
just
like
if
we
be
building
a
road
and
an
anthill
happens
to
be
in
the
way
we
don
t
hate
ant
we
be
just
building
a
road
and
so
good
bye
anthill
elon
be
not
the
only
one
who
have
express
concern
of
this
kind
one
of
the
world
s
great
mind
the
late
stephen
hawk
laid
it
out
in
plain
language
in
an
interview
with
the
bbc
in
the
theoretical
physicist
say
the
development
of
full
artificial
intelligence
could
spell
the
end
of
the
human
race
there
be
no
question
that
ai
will
soon
touch
almost
everything
human
do
artificial
intelligence
be
already
present
in
cell
phone
and
e
mail
function
like
predictive
text
and
navigation
google
translate
underwent
mind
blowing
overnight
improvement
when
it
switch
to
machine
learn
instead
of
human
sit
there
program
the
service
with
grammar

etc
example
be
endless
and
grow
google
assistant
announce
an
ai
base
feature
that
will
make
actual
real
life
phone
call
on
your
behalf
to
schedule
thing
like
hair
appointment
and
restaurant
reservation
in
a
demo
when
the
computer
call
a
hair
salon
the
receptionist
who
picked
up
didn
t
even
realize
a
computer
be
call
that
s
how
good
the
computer
be
at
sound
human
so
there
be
seriously
helpful
application
for
ai
it
can
even
be
use
to
sift
through
massive
amount
of
scientific
data
and
make
important
discovery
such
as
previously
unknown
exoplanets
in
the
galaxy
and
that
s
before
you
get
to
medical
application
of
the
lifesaving
variety
like
cancer
detection
but
this
technology
also
come
with
ethical
and
moral
dilemma
include
will
this
technology
kill
us
part
of
the
problem
as
elon
see
it
be
that
we
don
t
generally
think
thing
through
we
invent
we
discover
problem
with
our
invention
and
then
we
try
to
fix
them
which
usually
take
year
car
be
a
great
example
at
first
they
didn
t
have
seat
belt
in
crash
people
die
regularly
have
not
thought
through
how
to
keep
body
safe
in
a
crash
car
company
have
to
figure
it
out
later
and
come
up
with
seat
belt
but
it
take
year
for
a
law
to
actually
make
seat
belt
mandatory
and
set
a
universal
safety
standard
elon
s
point
be
why
not
think
it
all
the
way
through
first
why
not
start
with
regulation
and
ethic
and
a
clear
idea
of
what
the
problem
could
be
so
we
can
avoid
them
elon
even
take
his
concern
directly
to
president
barack
obama
and
to
a
meeting
of
all
fifty
governor
i
met
with
obama
for
one
reason
to
talk
about
the
danger
of
artificial
intelligence
in
elon
cofounded
a
nonprofit
call
openai
to
research
the
development
of
ai
and
how
can
ai
be
use
to
benefit
humanity
instead
of
um
to
annihilate
us
openai
be
a
nonprofit
ai
research
company
discover
and
enact
the
path
to
safe
artificial
general
intelligence
it
s
go
to
be
very
tempt
to
use
ai
as
a
weapon
in
fact
it
will
be
use
as
a
weapon
the
on
ramp
to
serious
ai
the
danger
be
go
to
be
more
human
use
it
against
each
other
i
think
most
likely
that
will
be
the
danger
he
explain
in
a
podcast
with
joe
rogan
as
of
this
write
openai
have
a
team
of
sixty
researcher
and
engineer
work
on
the
project
and
they
conduct
their
research
without
the
pressure
of
have
to
make
money
sponsor
include
elon
peter
thiel
microsoft
infosys
and
amazon
in
to
avoid
a
conflict
of
interest
elon
resign
from
the
board
because
tesla
be
use
ai
in
its
development
of
self
drive
technology
that
be
say
elon
remains
an
adviser
i
think
it
s
incredibly
important
that
ai
not
be
other
it
must
be
us
elon
explain
but
i
think
we
be
really
go
to
have
to
merge
with
ai
or
be
left
behind
and
in
fact
elon
have
another
company
call
neuralink
that
s
attempt
to
do
just
that
bookshelf
our
final
invention
artificial
intelligence
and
the
end
of
the
human
era
by
james
barrat
cyborg
forget
hybrid
car
what
if
you
could
have
a
hybrid
brain
part
natural
brain
with
a
huge
assist
from
a
tiny
supercomputer
access
to
the
world
s
knowledge
the
capacity
to
communicate
without
speak
or
type
we
have
a
bandwidth
problem
elon
say
you
just
can
t
communicate
through
your
finger
they
be
just
too
slow
there
be
still
not
a
lot
know
about
the
scope
of
neuralink
s
work
the
company
s
simple
website
say
neuralink
be
develop
ultra
high
bandwidth
brain
machine
interface
to
connect
human
and
computer
it
s
a
type
of
brain
computer
interface
that
could
give
you
superhuman
intelligence
it
s
possible
the
interface
may
involve
what
s
call
neural
lace
an
ultrathin
mesh
of
electrode
implant
directly
in
your
skull
elon
believe
that
people
already
have
some
sort
of
merger
with
biological
intelligence
and
machine
intelligence
to
some
degree
we
be
already
a
cyborg
if
you
think
of
the
digital
tool
you
have
your
phone
your
computer
the
application
he
say
in
at
the
world
government
summit
in
dubai
over
time
i
think
we
ll
probably
see
a
closer
merger
of
biological
intelligence
and
digital
intelligence
and
it
s
mostly
about
the
bandwidth
the
speed
of
the
connection
between
your
brain
and
the
digital
extension
of
yourself
as
elon
see
it
the
bottleneck
be
output
our
poor
thumb
can
t
keep
up
with
express
what
s
happen
in
our
brain
so
some
high
bandwidth
interface
to
the
brain
i
think
will
be
something
that
help
achieve

up
in
knot
try
to
get

on
the

as
soon
as
possible
the
fundamental
value
of
a

be
the
degree
to
which
it
accelerates
the
advent
of
sustainable
energy
faster
than
it
would
otherwise
occur
elon
explain

so
when
i
think
like
what

the
fundamental
good
of

i
would

hopefully
if
it
accelerate
that
by

potentially
more
than

that
would

quite
a

thing
will
he

on

that
s
a
very
different
goal
and
he
have
say
that
when
there
be
more
electric

not
that

an

up
look
at

wonder
about
the

his

there
be
still
year
of
technological
problem
to
solve
before
this
mission

elon
doesn
t
mince
word
about
how
dangerous
it
be
send
civilian
into
deep
space
aboard
new
technology
could
result
in

fear
be
not
go
to
paralyze
elon
whether
solve
this
problem
or
the
many
others
that
he
will
take
on
elon
have
described
the
daily
deluge
of
thought
as
an
ever
present
explosion
of
idea
it
s
impossible
to
predict
what
he
ll
tackle
next
but
his
drive
be
unmistakable
as
be
his
willingness
to
confront
some
of
the
big
problem
that
exist
on
earth
and
beyond

might

option
