i
learn
in
any
year
in
school
and
he
credit
her
with
move
him
onto
the
right
path
i
m
one
hundred
per
cent
sure
that
if
it
hadn
t
be
for
mr
hill
in
fourth
grade
and
a
few
others
i
would
absolutely
have
end
up
in
jail
he
say
later
with
his
interest
in
school
reignite
and
his
performance
seemingly
on
track
job
be
test
and
score
so
high
that
school
official
recommend
he
skip
a
couple
of
grade
his
parent
agree
to
let
him
skip
just
one
middle
school
be
tougher
academically
and
he
still
want
to
chase
butterfly
a
sixth
grade
report
call
him
an
excellent
reader
but
note
he
have
great
difficulty
motivate
himself
or
see
the
purpose
of
study
reading
he
be
also
a
discipline
problem
at
time
seventh
grade
brought
a
much
rougher
crowd
of
classmate
fight
be
common
some
student
bully
the
wiry
kid
who
be
a
year
young
than
everyone
else
job
be
miserable
and
in
the
middle
of
that
year
he
give
his
parent
an
ultimatum
he
say
if
he
have
to
go
back
to
school
there
again
he
just
wouldn
t
go
his
father
recall
they
take
him
seriously
so
we
decide
we
well
move
his
dad
say
his
parent
pull
together
what
little
they
have
and
bought
a
three
bedroom
home
in
los
alto
where
the
school
be
top
notch
and
safe
there
presumably
their
gift
son
might
focus
on
his
study
but
in
the
mid
s
time
be
change
job
would
soon
have
other
thing
on
his
mind
for
the
time
they
be
a
changin
bob
dylan

woz
the
new
school
be
indeed
an
improvement
and
job
found
other
boy
who
share
his
interest
there
he
would
form
friendship
that
eventually
would
change
his
life
he
be
also
lucky
to
be
grow
up
in
the
santa
clara
valley
a
place
packed
full
of
engineer
and
tinkerer
who
would
help
feed
his
grow
passion
for
the
expand
field
of
electronics
realize
his
son
didn
t
share
his
interest
in
car
and
other
kind
of
mechanic
paul
job
have
brought
him
electronic
gizmo
to
take
apart
and
study
from
the
time
he
be
in
grade
school
steve
job
also
found
a
mentor
in
his
old
neighbourhood
a
hewlett
packard
company
engineer
name
larry
lang
who
intrigue
job
with
an
old
fashion
carbon
microphone
set
up
in
his
driveway
that
didn
t
need
an
electronic
amplifier
lang
introduce
the
boy
to
heathkits
a
conglomeration
of
electronic
part
and
detailed
instruction
that
let
hobbyist
build
radio
and
other
gadget
you
actually
paid
more
money
for
them
than
if
you
just
go
and
bought
the
finish
product
job
remember
but
he
be
intrigue
by
how
put
together
the
kit
help
him
understand
how
thing
work
and
give
him
confidence
in
what
he
could
build
these
thing
be
not
mystery
anymore
i
mean
you
look
at
a
television
set
and
you
would
think
that
i
haven
t
built
one
of
those
but
i
could
there
s
one
of
those
in
the
heathkit
catalogue
and
i
ve
built
two
other
heathkits
so
i
could
build
that
job
say
it
give
a
tremendous
level
of
self
confidence
that
through
exploration
and
learn
one
could
understand
seemingly
very
complex
thing
in
one
s
environment
even
after
the
family
move
job
stayed
in

interested
in
the
many
campus
of
the

he
could
have

conclude
that
it

for
the

year
be
about
in
today
s

and
that
be
simply
more
than
his
parent
could
afford
to
pay
his

aghast
at
the
cost

bad
he
have

he
no
longer
have

thrill
about
the

he
almost
immediately
come
down
with

food
i
hadn
t
be
fortunate
enough
to
smell
good
food
for
a
long
time
so
i
wander
up
to
pay
my
respect
and
eat
some
lunch
he
recall
he
apparently
stood
out
in
the
crowd
while
he
be
eat
the

man
of
the
festival
spot
him
and
sat
down
next
to
him
laugh
unable
to
communicate
well
the
holy
man
grabbed
job
s
arm
and
lead
him
up
a
mountain
trail
to
an
area
with
a
well
and
a
small
pond
there
the
holy
man
dunked
job
s
head
in
water
pull
out
a
razor
and
shave
his
head
say
it
be
for
the
young
man
s
health
by
the
time
kottke
show
up
to
travel
with
him
job
be
thin
nearly
bald
and
wear
lightweight
cotton
garb
the
pair
rode
rickety

negotiate
at
market
and
hike
along
dry
riverbed
though
he
be
search
for
a
deeper
spiritual
awareness
job
be
struck
by
the
juxtaposition
of
extreme
poverty
and
religious
holiness
the
pair
sought
out
a
guru
that
friedland
have
told
them
about
after
a
trip
the
year
before
but
the
guru
have
die
and
everyone
have
scatter
leave
behind
little
more
than
plastic
religious
trinket
they
continued
their
journey

scabies
in
a
town
know
for
its

after
he
battle
louse
and
flea
kottke
cut
his
hair
off
as
well
ultimately
job
conclude
we
weren
t
go
to
find
a
place
where
we
could
go
for
a
month
to
be
enlighten
have
just
come
from
a
job
in
technology
he
begin
to
think
that
maybe
thomas
edison
do
a
lot
more
to
improve
the
world
than
any
theorist
or
religious
guru
after
several
month
he
and
kottke
return
to
northern
california
move
by
the
intense
experience
year
later
job
say
that
his
experience
in
india
taught
him
the
power
of
intuition
and
experiential
wisdom
of
rely
on
your
experience
and
common
sense
as
oppose
to
western
intellect
and
rational
think
a
difference
of
approach
that
influence
his
life
s
work
even
so
as
job
move
out
of
his
teen
and
into
his
third
decade
he
be
still
search
for
something
big
for
the
next
year
or
so
he
alternate
between
his
somewhat
traditional
life
in
silicon
valley
work
at
atari
audit
a
stanford
physic
class
and
study
at
a
local
zen
center
and
his
unusual
oregon
lifestyle
with
his
college
friend
he
periodically
stayed
and
work
at
the
friedland
farm
now
the
all
one
farm
commune
he
begin
to
seek
information
about
his
birth
parent
learn
that
they
have
be
unmarried
graduate
student
he
also
paid
for
a
twelve
week
course
at
the
oregon
feel
center
which
be
suppose
to
address
deep
seat
problem
from
childhood
through
primal
scream
therapy
ultimately
he
decide
that
wasn
t
the
answer
he
be
look
for
either
in
the
summer
of
he
be
back
at
atari
work
night
as
a
consultant
when
company
founder
nolan
bushnell
give
him
a
special
assignment
bushnell
a
thirty
three
year
old
entrepreneur
who
have
take
a
like
to
job
ask
him
to
design
a
game
call
breakout
in
which
player
destroy
a
brick
wall
with
a
bounce
ball
because
game
in
those
day
be
programmed
into
the
chip
not
write
as
separate
software
like
they
be
today
bushnell
want
as
few
chip
as
possible
in
the
design
and
he
want
it
fast
actually
really
fast
he
want
it
do
in
four
day
job
be
also
spending
time
with
his
old
high
school
friend
steve
wozniak
who
have
drop
out
of
college
again
to
earn
money
and
be
now
work
at
a
dream
job
for
hewlett
packard
in
the
calculator
business
wozniak
wasn
t
interested
in
mind
alter
drug
but
he
be
hopelessly
addict
to
an
atari
arcade
game
call
gran
trak
and
job
be
regularly
let
his
friend
into
the
atari
office
at
night
where
woz
could
play
the
first
video
game
with
a
steer
wheel
to
his
heart
s
content
there
be
another
benefit
he
could
help
job
if
he
get
stuck
on
something
know
the
design
work
be
beyond
his
skill
job
recruit
wozniak
to
figure
out
the
chip
and
design
promising
he
would
split
the
he
be
be
paid
for
the
project
work
through
the
night
after
he
get
off
his
hewlett
packard
job
wozniak
craft
the
design
use
a
minimum
number
of
chip
and
job
incorporate
them
into
a
prototype
board
bushnell
who
would
later
found
the
chuck
e
cheese
pizza
chain
be
so
pleased
with
the
design
he
paid
job
a
bonus
report
to
be
he
also
offer
wozniak
a
job
job
paid
woz
but
just
the
he
be
promise
at
the
start
and
head
back
to
oregon
the
two
both
paid
a
price
for
their
intense
work
they
both
come
down
with
the
energy
sap
virus
mononucleosis
when
the
amount
of
the
bonus
bushnell
give
job
be
disclose
in
a
book
about
atari
s
history
ten
year
later
long
after
the
pair
have
found
apple
wozniak
be
truly
hurt
he
felt
his
good
friend
hadn
t
be
honest
and
have
betrayed
him
when
job
heard
about
the
book
he
call
his
old
friend
and
told
him
that
he
didn
t
remember
keep
a
bonus
and
since
he
surely
would
have
remember
it
he
probably
didn
t
do
it
many
year
later
when
job
s
biographer
walter
isaacson
quiz
job
about
the
payment
he
become
unusually
quiet
and
hesitant
i
don
t
know
where
that
allegation
come
from
he
say
i
give
him
half
the
money
i
ever
get
still
both
bushnell
and
alcorn
remember
that
a
bonus
be
paid
and
woz
be
sure
he
receive
only
it
be
an
ugly
side
of
steve
job
the
charmer
who
sometimes
only
take
care
of
himself
in
many
way
it
be
fortunate
that
wozniak
didn
t
know
the
whole
story
when
it
happen
he
have
be
attend
meeting
of
a
new
computer
club
and
be
so
intrigue
that
he
be
soon
try
to
design
his
own
computer
he
couldn
t
help
but
share
his
idea
with
his
good
friend
and
recent
collaborator
steve
job
what
come
next
would
change
both
of
their
life
it
would
also
change
the
world
steve
wozniak
and
steve
job
work
on
the
apple
i
in

apple
to
say
that
steve
wozniak
be
wowed
with
the
idea
of
a
computer
in
a
small
box
might
be
an
understatement
at
the
least
he
be
incredibly
inspire
by
the
idea
and
couldn
t
wait
to
try
it
out
in
january
popular
electronics
ran
a
cover
story
on
the
first
real
micro
computer
the
altair
make
by
a
company
out
of
albuquerque
new
mexico
it
be
a
kit
really
which
take
hour
to
assemble
and
didn
t
really
work
very
well
once
it
be
together
it
didn
t
come
with
any
other
accessory
no
screen
no
keyboard
not
even
a
way
to
talk
to
it
to
use
it
a
hobbyist
have
to
write
a
program
and
even
then
about
all
the
altair
could
do
be
blink
back
with
the
light
on
the
front
of
the
box
in
many
way
it
be
surprisingly
similar
to
the
cream
soda
computer
that
wozniak
have
show
off
to
steve
job
nearly
five
year
before
but
there
be
one
huge
difference
inside
while
wozniak
have
be
focus
on
calculator
at
hewlett
run
a
dial
a
joke
service
from
his
home
and
date
his
first
girlfriend
the
power
and
ability
of
semiconductor
have
explode
start
in
the
late
s
engineer
have
figure
out
how
to
combine
many
transistor
on
a
small
slice
of
silicon
along
with
the
connection
between
them
these
new
integrate
circuit
or
microchip
could
hold
chunk
of
memory
or
handle
other
task
take
over
whole
section
of
a
computer
but
the
circuit
be
hardwired
into
the
chip
meaning
the
chip
could
only
do
what
they
be
programmed
to
do
like
job
s
and
wozniak
s
version
of
breakout
in
the
early
s
however
a
young
silicon
valley
company
call
intel
corporation
developed
a
single
chip
that
could
actually
be
programmed
to
perform
all
kind
of
new
and
different
function
this
so
call
microprocessor
the
size
of
a
fingertip
combine
several
function
into
one
and
could
be
the
entire
central
processing
unit
or
cpu
of
a
computer
the
brain
inside
the
box
and
it
could
be
driven
by
software
special
program
write
to
specifically
teach
it
to
complete
many
kind
of
task
as
intel
improve
on
its
microprocessor
allow
it
to
work
faster
and
handle
more
information
at
one
time
the
idea
of
a
microcomputer
a
true
personal
computer
become
a
reality
wozniak
get
his
first
whiff
of
these
huge
development
when
he
attend
the
initial
meeting
of
the
homebrew
computer
club
in
a
menlo
park
california
garage
that
march
it
be
a
cold
and
drizzly
even
but
many
of
the
thirty
people
who
show
up
be
buzzing
about
the
altair
and
the
possibility
of
a
small
computer
someone
pass
out
a
data
sheet
on
a
compete
microprocessor
wozniak
take
the
sheet
home
and
study
the
detail
of
this
new
kind
of
chip
suddenly
he
have
a
revelation
it
be
as
if
my
whole
life
have
be
lead
up
to
this
point
he
say
later
all
those
time
he
have
drawn
sketch
of
redesign
minicomputer
the
crude
cream
soda
computer
his
work
on
video
game
all
of
that
have
lead
him
to
this
very
opportunity
that
night
the
night
of
that
first
meeting
this
whole
vision
of
a
kind
of
personal
computer
just
popped
into
my
head
all
at
once
just
like
that
right
away
he
begin
sketch
a
design
conceptualize
his
new
computer
turn
out
to
be
much
easy
than
building
it
the
fabulous
intel
chip
it
turn
out
cost
about
almost
more
than
my
monthly
rent
he
say
in
addition
he
would
need
memory
chip
a
language
for
communicate
with
the
chip
and
other
piece
it
would
take
time
and
money
to
pull
it
all
together
early
on
wozniak
discover
that
hewlett
packard
employee
could
get
a
discount
on
a
motorola
microprocessor
with
the
same
potential
as
the
intel
one
and
then
he
found
an
even
cheaper
alternative
a
knock
off
from
a
little
know
company
that
would
run
his
design
exactly
as
he
d
conceive
it
he
have
make
the
decision
base
on
economics
not
on
engineering
and
it
would
turn
out
to
be
a
significant
and
potentially
foolish
one
nearly
every
other
computer
would
be
design
on
the
intel
chip
which
be
different
enough
that
every
piece
of
software
that
talk
to
it
would
have
to
be
different
too
wozniak
s
friend
steve
job
go
to
a
few
homebrew
meeting
carry
in
woz
s
television
set
so
that
he
could
demonstrate
his
late
development
on
the
television
screen
but
job
found
the
geeky
conversation
of
the
every
other
week
gathering
tedious
the
club
be
so
nerdy
wozniak
once
joked
that
you
could
have
call
it
chip
and
dip
still
every
time
the
two
chat
on
the
phone
or
get
together
they
discuss
the
computer
and
wozniak
s
progress
by
late
june
wozniak
have
a
breakthrough
he
have
pull
together
chip
a
power
supply
a
monitor
and
a
keyboard
the
first
time
he
typed
on
the
keyboard
letter
popped
up
on
the
monitor
just
like
they
be
suppose
to
it
be
a
eureka
moment
have
it
be
left
fully
to
wozniak
he
would
have
give
away
all
of
his
design
and
detail
to
member
of
the
club
whose
motto
be
give
help
to
others
but
job
admire
his
friend
s
clever
work
and
see
a
big
opportunity
encourage
him
to
stop
share
so
much
with
the
club
which
have
balloon
to
several
hundred
member
later
that
year
job
make
a
proposal
many
of
the
hobbyist
show
up
to
the
club
have
idea
but
not
enough
time
to
carry
them
through
so
he
suggest
he
and
wozniak
could
sell
print
circuit
board
to
them
and
the
member
could
just
plug
in
their
own
chip
a
much
simpler
process
than
design
board
themselves
wozniak
be
sceptical
that
there
would
be
much
interest
or
that
the
two
could
earn
back
the
it
would
cost
but
job
who
still
hadn
t
figure
out
what
he
really
want
to
do
with
his
life
be
persistent
tell
him
well
even
if
we
lose
our
money
we
ll
have
a
company
wozniak
give
in
and
the
two
begin
to
scrounge
up
their
initial
investment
wozniak
sell
his
h
p
calculator
for
but
the
buyer
ultimately
paid
him
only
half
that
job
sell
his
red
and
white
volkswagen
bus
but
he
have
to
spend
some
of
his
profit
on
repair
the
bus
after
it
broke
down
shortly
after
the
sale
together
they
manage
to
raise
about
equal
to
about
today
next
they
need
a
name
for
their
partnership
on
the
way
back
from
the
airport
after
wozniak
picked
up
job
from
another
trip
to
the
all
one
farm
job
threw
out
a
suggestion
apple
computer
after
all
he
have
just
come
back
from
the
apple
orchard
and
he
be
in
one
of
his
fruitarian
stage
eat
a
lot
of
apple
even
well
the
name
would
put
them
near
the
top
of
any
alphabetical
list
and
ahead
of
atari
in
the
phone
book
they
try
to
come
up
with
something
well
like
matrix
electronics
or
executek
but
apple
just
seem
to
fit
both
fret
however
that
they
might
run
afoul
of
the
beatles
the
famous
quartet
know
for
its
apple
record
label
that
turn
out
to
be
a
real
concern
and
job
worried
that
maybe
apple
be
too
cutesy
for
a
company
that
want
to
be
take
seriously
but
unable
to
come
up
with
anything
well
they
go
ahead
with
it
job
convince
ron
wayne
a
former
bos
from
the
night
shift
at
atari
to
create
a
logo
and
draw
up
what
go
where
the
schematic
of
the
circuit
board
wayne
produce
an
elaborate
etch
of
newton
under
a
tree
with
a
glow
apple
overhead
as
they
move
forward
wozniak
begin
to
sweat
about
the
consequence
what
if
he
have
to
use
some
of
his
idea
for
apple
in
his
job
at
hewlett
packard
what
if
he
want
to
share
his
idea
some
other
way
to
clear
his
conscience
wozniak
also
told
his
boss
at
h
p
that
he
have
come
up
with
a
design
for
a
small
inexpensive
computer
a
meeting
be
set
up
with
some
h
p
manager
and
wozniak
present
his
computer
those
senior
be
interested
but
they
couldn
t
envision
it
as
a
product
for
h
p
they
told
wozniak
that
the
company
wasn
t
interested
wozniak
be
disappointed
but
he
could
now
pursue
the
computer
on
his
own
he
and
job
agree
to
split
their
share
equally
but
sense
that
they
also
need
a
tie
breaker
they
make
wayne
a
partner
too
give
him
a
per
cent
stake
while
they
each
receive
per
cent
wayne
drew
up
an
agreement
and
on
april
the
three
sign
it
officially
create
apple
computer
the
arrangement
would
be
short
live
wayne
be
in
his
forty
and
much
more
conservative
than
his
twenty
something
partner
he
already
have
suffer
big
loss
when
he
try
to
start
a
slot
machine
company
and
fail
now
if
apple
ran
into
trouble
he
would
be
on
the
hook
again
reflect
on
that
he
get
cold
foot
i
have
already
learn
what
give
me
indigestion
he
say
if
apple
have
fail
i
would
have
have
bruise
on
top
of
bruise
steve
job
be
an
absolute
whirlwind
and
i
have
lose
the
energy
you
need
to
ride
whirlwind
shortly
after
he
sign
he
pull
out
of
the
partnership
receive
for
his
share
later
just
to
be
sure
everything
be
fair
apple
would
pay
him
another
that
be
good
enough
for
him
have
he
stayed
on
however
and
held
on
to
his
piece
of
the
company
until
today
he
would
have
become
a
billionaire
job
and
wozniak
would
soon
be
too
busy
to
think
about
the
setback
try
to
drum
up
sale
for
the
one
hundred
circuit
board
he
have
order
job
stroll
barefoot
into
a
new
computer
store
call
the
byte
shop
and
begin
to
pitch
paul
terrell
the
owner
and
a
homebrew
computer
club
regular
terrell
be
try
to
build
a
chain
to
rival
radioshack
and
he
quickly
get
to
the
point
with
the
aggressive
young
salesman
he
didn
t
want
circuit
board
and
neither
do
his
customer
a
computer
store
need
computer
and
if
little
apple
want
to
provide
him
with
fully
built
computer
he
would
buy
fifty
of
them
at
about
each
in
cash
job
be
stun
he
have
be
look
to
sell
some
circuit
board
and
now
he
have
a
order
in
hand
dollar
sign
flash
in
front
of
his
eye
he
call
wozniak
right
away
be
you
sit
down
he
ask
wozniak
be
shock
astound
really
the
order
be
for
roughly
his
annual
salary
far
more
than
he
could
have
ever
imagine
but
the
tiny
company
have
no
part
no
money
to
buy
them
and
no
place
to
put
the
computer
together
how
would
it
ever
deliver
apple
v
apple
steve
job
and
steve
wozniak
be
right
to
worry
about
whether
name
their
new
company
apple
would
cause
trouble
with
the
beatles
company
apple
corp
they
be
way
too
inexperienced
and
na
ve
to
hire
a
lawyer
to
formally
investigate
the
question
but
in
fact
their
decision
do
spark
a
long
run
feud
between
two
of
the
world
s
big
apple
once
apple
computer
begin
get
attention
apple
corp
sue
it
in
a
settlement
apple
computer
agree
to
stick
to
computer
leave
the
music
to
apple
corp
in
the
late
s
former
beatle
george
harrison
saw
that
the
macintosh
computer
could
be
use
to
compose
music
and
could
include
a
device
that
would
allow
musician
to
program
instrument
apple
corp
sue
again
after
a
month
long
trial
the
two
side
reach
a
new
settlement
with
apple
computer
pay
an
estimate
million
to
resolve
the
issue
the
creation
of
the
itunes
store
in
reopen
the
old
wound
and
lead
to
yet
another
lawsuit
the
two
reach
a
final
agreement
in
give
apple
control
of
all
the

some
of
which
it
license
back
to
the

even
so
beatles

it
be
as
far
too
many
story

childhood
home
in
los

california
and
the

where
apple
computer
first
launch

garage
to
build
a
company
even
a
small
one
you
need
money
so
job
first
go
look
for
cash
or
at
least
someone
willing
to
let
him
purchase
part
that
he
would
pay
for
later
he

add

proud
papa
computer
talk
to
build
his
new
computer
wozniak
need
more
than
a
microprocessor
here
be
some
of
the
other
component
found
in
the
apple
ii
and
many
other
computer
rom
be
read
only

this
chip
hold
specialise
fix
information
that
can
t
be
erase
or
change
once
wozniak
write
a
language
to
work
on
the
apple
it
be
store
in
the
read
only
memory
so
that
it
come
up
when
the
computer
be
turn
on
ram
be
random
access
memory
this
memory
be
temporary
and
it
can
be
erase
and
write
over
when
you
open
up
new
program
on
your

your
computer
s
ram
help
you
do
that
that
s
also
why
you
can
lose
your
work
if
you
don
t
save
it
regularly
to
a
hard
drive
with
the
apple
ii
wozniak
become
an
early
user
of
dram
or
dynamic
random

which
require
continual
electronic
refresh
dram
chip
be
also
small
and
cheaper
than
the
old
static
random

sram
chip
meaning
more
could
be
use
wozniak
s
first
apple
ii
have
eight
thousand
byte
of
dram
today
most
computer
user
want
two
to
four
billion
byte
of
memory
so
their
computer
will
work
quickly
and
smoothly
basic
be
a
simple
computer
language
that
allows
people
to
write
program
and
software
that
tell
the
computer
what
to
do
just
like
we
need
word
to
communicate
a
computer
need
a
language
too
one
of
the
early
basic
language
be
write
for
the
altair
by
some
harvard

marty
davidoff
base
on
a
basic

corporation
gate
and
allen
would
go
on
to
start
a
company
call
microsoft
wozniak
write
his
basic
for
apple
base
on
an
h
p
version
just
as
people
in
texas
speak
differently
than
those
in
new

the
two
version
of
basic
weren
t
the
same
for
a
program
write
for
the
apple
to
work
on
a
computer
run
gate
s
and
allen

basic
some

would
have
to
take
place
after
apple
s
success
with
the
apple
ii
computer
steve

become
something
of
a

a

its

as

it
need

more

so
on
that

the

the
next
year
with
the

each

they

reduce
the

since
each

paid
more
than

the

on
way
to
make

the

sat
next
to
the

help
the

navigate
around

they
also
have
take
the
idea
of
a
desk
with
its
scatter
paper

and
in
a
fashion

one
of
those

what
xerox
call
a

he
be
certain
that
every

would
work
this
way
some
day
it
be
so
obvious
once
you
saw
it
what
be
also
clear
to
job
be
that
apple
could
make
it
happen
some
would
later
accuse
apple
of
rip
off
xerox
s
idea
job
didn

when
he
often
quote
picasso
as

good
artist
copy
great
artist
steal
in
truth
xerox
have
the
idea
but
it
have
not
developed
them
to
the
point
where
they
could
be
incorporate
into
a
simple
desktop
computer
job

to
the
fact
that

executive
who
grabbed
defeat
from
the
great
victory
of
the
computer
industry
xerox
would
try
later
to
bring
its
amaze
work
to
market
but
would
miss
the
mark
with
a
computer
for
the
office
that
cost
meanwhile
apple
now
go
up
against
new
personal
computer
from
much
big
company
like
texas
instrument
and
radioshack
need
something
special
to

clever
work
and
an
ever
great
amount
of
software
write
specifically
for
it
but
that
wouldn

last
forever
in

a

behind

the
company

work
on
a

for
the

call
the
apple
iii
which
would
be
introduce
in
but
it
also
have
two
other
project
underway
one
for
a
very
low
cost
everyman
s
computer
and
another
that
would
be
a
faster
more
sophisticated
machine
use
the
late
technology
that
project
be
call
lisa
for
a
time
apple
insist
that
lisa
be
an
acronym
for
local
integrate
system
architecture
meaningless
but
official
sound
tech
gobbledygook
but
as
you
ve
already
figure
out
it
be
really
name
for
job
s
daughter
immediately
job
begin
look
for
way
to
incorporate
the
clever
idea
he
have
see
into
the
lisa
computer
he
contact
dean
hovey
of
hovey
kelley
design
and
order
up
a
mouse
though
hovey
have
no
idea
what
a
mouse
be
job
explain
how
it
should
work
and
that
it
should
move
in
all
direction
not
just
up
and
down
or
left
and
right
he
also
make
clear
that
he
want
to
be
able
to
use
this
mouse
on
his
jean
as
well
as
on
a
desktop
surface
inspire
but
unsure
of
the
part
hovey
head
to
walgreens
there
he
bought
several
type
of
roll
on
deodorant
to
study
their
ball
mechanism
and
a
small
butter
dish
to
act
as
the
rectangular
block
on
top
from
those
he
built
the
first
roll
mouse
prototype
while
the
xerox
mouse
have
three
button
job
insist
that
the
lisa
mouse
have
only
one
so
user
wouldn
t
have
to
look
at
it
as
they
work
lisa
designer
prefer
a
second
button
that
would
work
something
like
the
shift
key
on
the
keyboard
but
to
make
one
button
work
they
taught
it
two
move
the
click
and
the
now
familiar
double
click
job
be
so
energize
by
what
he
have
see
at
xerox
that
he
begin
to
push
the
lisa
team
to
develop
more
new
tool
and
graphic
and
to
aspire
to
a
big
more
cosmic
goal
he
urge
them
on
say
let
s
make
a
dent
in
the
universe
we
ll
make
it
so
important
that
it
will
make
a

marketing
manager
who
go
on
to

electronic

he
didn

gradually
take
over
the

this
worried
mike
scott
the
lisa
be
to
be
an
innovative
product
for
the
business
market
and
he
doubt
that
job
who
be
disruptive
and
overbear
could
manage
a
division
just
recently
the
apple
iii
have
suffer
partly
at
his
hand
unlike
the
apple
ii
which
have
be
design
largely
by
woz
the
apple
iii
be
design
by
committee
with
everyone
involve
put
a
fingerprint
on
it
as
he
do
with
the
apple
ii
job
insist
on
design
the
case
but
the
one
he
approve
for
the
apple
iii
wasn
t
big
enough
to
fit
all
the
circuitry
that
need
to
go
inside
it
the
engineer
jerry
rig
the
board
but
that
create
problem
later
some
component
simply
didn
t
work
well
and
that
huge
catalogue
of
apple
ii
software
would
run
on
the
machine
only
if
you
disabled
some
of
the
newer
feature
new
software
need
to
be
write
after
the
apple
iii
come
out
in
late
some
chip
regularly
manage
to
wiggle
loose
until
the
machine
could
be
redesign
the
company
recommend
lift
the
front
end
a
few
inch
and
let
it
drop
while
that
seem
to
push
chip
back
in
their
place
it
be
an
embarrass
low
tech
solution
though
the
apple
iii
be
a
mess
improve
version
of
the
apple
ii
continued
to
fly
off
the
shelf
by
autumn
the
company
have
sell
more
than
three
hundred
thousand
of
the
beige
box
and
record
million
in
annual
sale
but
the
apple
iii
be
a
dud
that
never
sell
well
raise
question
about
apple
s
ability
to
make
a
serious
computer
for
the

steve
job
john
sculley
and
steve
wozniak
unveil
a
new
apple
computer
lisa
would
be
another
chance
and
job
desperately
want
to
run
the
lisa
project
but
scott
put
someone
else
in
charge
in
a
management
shuffle
job
be
name
chairman
of
the
company
the
top
position
but
he
essentially
be
a
figurehead
who
would
continue
to
be
the
public
face
and
voice
of
apple
he
be
hurt
and
angry
at
be
remove
from
lisa
but
it
freed
him
to
focus
on
the
immediate
task
at
hand
apple
be
about
to
sell
its
share
to
the
public
for
the
first
time
go
public
as
the
process
be
call
be
a
rite
of
passage
for
fast
grow
company
a
way
to
bring
in
a
broader
swathe
of
investor
by
allow
anyone
to
buy
share
or
ownership
of
a
tiny
bite
of
apple
the
money
raise
from
sell
stock
to
the

would
fuel
more
growth
in
addition
once

make
it

take
more
interest
in
the
idea
of
a
simple
inexpensive
computer
and
move
to
control
the
project
he
also
begin
to
push
for
some
of
the
excite
innovation
he
have
see
at
xerox
one
of
those
have
be
a
choice
of
wonderful
font
until
then
computer
have
only
one
typeface
a
boxy
jagged
version
that
be
easy
to
display
on
inexpensive
monitor
job
push
for
the
macintosh
to
adopt
the
ability
to
let

choose
from
a
menu
of
typeface
in
different
size
in

the
decision
drew
on
his
experience
at
reed
college
while
there
because
he
wasn
t
take
require
class
he
have
drop
into
a
class
on
calligraphy
and
the
element
of
beautiful
typestyles
at
the
time
the
study
seem
completely
random
but
now
in
the
early
s
they
be
useful
again
thanks
in
large
part
to
that
class
at
reed
the
mac
would
be
the
first

computer
to
give
user
the
chance
to
write
attractive
business
letter
or
make
sign
or

it
be
an
odd
and
unexpected
chain
of
event
job
s
decision
to
quit
college
and
drop
in
on
a
calligraphy
class
lead
to
a
new
use
for
the

that
would
be
copy
by
others
he
couldn
t
have
envision
all
that
when
he
be
just
seventeen
that
revelation
that
experience
taught
him
a
valuable
lesson
he
told
the
stanford
graduate
because
we
can
t
see
what
s
ahead
you
have
to
trust
that
the
dot
will
somehow
connect
in
your
future
in
the
same
way
the
company
reorganisation
and
the
ejection
from
the
lisa
project
similar
connect
dot
lead
job
to
the
macintosh
this
too
be
another
bit
of
karma
almost
like
the
way
the
very
first
apple
come
together
in
the
job
garage
jef
raskin
who
have
name
the

by
intentionally
misspell
his
favourite
apple
dream
of
building
an
inexpensive
computer
as
friendly
and
useful
as
a
kitchen
appliance
a
concept
that
appeal
to
job
s
desire
to
make
compute
available
to
everyone
but
when
job
begin
to
meddle
in
the
work
and
then
dictate
what
the
computer
should
be
he
rubbed
people
the
wrong
way
in

and
didn
t
give
credit
where
it
be
due
he
go
on
to
spell
out
a
criticism
that
would
be
repeat
throughout
job
s
career
very
often
when
told
of
a
new
idea
he
will
immediately
attack
it
and
say
that
it
be
worthless
or
even
stupid
raskin
write
then
if
the
idea
be
a
good
one
job
will
soon
be
tell
people
about
it
as
though
it
be
his
own
everything
raskin
write
may
have
be
completely
true
but
it
didn
t
go
down
well
he
be
summon
to
a
meeting
with
job
and
when
the
two
agree
that
they
couldn
t
agree
raskin
be
ask
to
take
a
leave
of
absence
scott

a
human
s
speed
the
computer
would
act
as
a
bicycle
for
the
mind
the
team
have
to
talk
him
out
of
it
one
software
designer
who
be
write
a
draw
program
that
would
come
with
the
computer
found
a
way
to
create
oval
and
circle
quickly
job
like
it
but
immediately
want
something
else
could
it
also
create
rectangle
with
round
corner
the
designer
balk
add
that
would
be
tough
and
wasn
t
really
necessary
but
job
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
rectangle
with
round
corner
be
everywhere
he
insist
and
he
begin
to
call
out
example
around
the
room
then
he
drag
the
designer
on
a
walk
around
the
block
point
out
a
no
parking
sign
with
round
corner
on
see
this
the
designer
give
in
and
add
roundrects
to
his
repertoire
sometimes
the
designer
push
back
but
not
too
hard
chris

who
have
start
in
the

of
job
s
endless
tinker
of
his
design
of
a
little
calculator
that
would
be
part
of
the
computer
s
desktop
each
time
he
saw
it
job
would
disapprove
the
line
be
too
thick
the
background
too
dark
or
the
button
be
the
wrong
size
finally
espinosa
create
a

he
call

to

of

variable
himself
job
sat
down
and
fiddle
for
a
little
while
finally
settle
on
his
choice
that
design
would
be
the
macintosh
calculator
for
many
year
as
the
work
move
forward
job
worried
that
the
little
computer
take
too
long
to
boot
up
he
urge
the
team
to
cut
the
time
with
a
little
reality
distort
math
guess
that
within
a
few
year
five
million
people
a
day
would
be
use
a
mac
a
ridiculous
estimate
give
that
only
a
few
hundred
thousand
apple
ii
have
be
sell
over
several
year
he
note
that
slash
ten
second
would
save
fifty
million
second
every
day
over
a
year
that
s
probably
dozen
of
lifetime
he
told
them
now
on
a
roll
he
make
a
particularly
big
leap
if
you
could
make
it
boot
ten
second
faster
you
ll
save
a
dozen
life
that
s
really
worth
it
don
t
you
think
the
team
figure
out
how
to
shorten
the
boot
up
time
in
every
case
he
be
seek
something
that
would
be
easy
and
simpler
to
use
because
as
the
original
brochure
say
simplicity
be
the
ultimate
sophistication
when
you
first
look
at
a
problem
it
seem
easy
because
you
don
t
know
that
much
about
it
he
say
then
you
get
into
the
problem
and
you
see
it
s
really
complicate
and
you
come
up
with
all
these
convolute
solution
most
people
stop
there
but
the
key
be
to
keep
go
he
say
until
you
find
the
underlie
principle
of
the
problem
and
sort
of
come
full
circle
with
a
beautiful
elegant
solution
that
work
perhaps
draw
on
his
zen
study
job

as
intensely
on
what
to
leave
out
of
a

seriously
welcome
to
the
most
excite
and
important
marketplace
since
the
computer
revolution
begin
year
ago
because
apple
have
such
a
head
start
and
because
there
be
nothing
special
or
even
fun
about
the
ibm
pc
the
young
apple
crew
scoffed
at
it
but
in
look
only
at
the
machine
they
ignore
ibm
s
stellar
reputation
its
powerful
sale
force
and
the
enormous
clout
it
carry
among
business
buyer
they
didn
t
understand
that
a
corporate
technology
manager
might
get
in
hot
water
for
buying
a
no
name
machine
but
no
one
would
ever
be
fire
for
buying
an
ibm
true
the
computer
wasn
t
great
but
it
be
good
enough
and
ibm
s
sale
grow
quickly
as
it
picked
up
more
and
more
business
customer
to
ensure
that
the
mac
would
have
software
job
travel
in
to
seattle
to
meet
with
bill
gate
and
paul
allen
the
young
founder
of
software
company
microsoft
year
earlier
microsoft
have
write
the
first
basic
program
for
the
altair

it
have
also
write
the
version
of
basic
now
run
on
the
apple
ii
it
create
the
operating

for
the
ibm
computer
the
software
that
told
the
computer
hardware
what
to
do
and
that
create
a
basis
for
everything
else
job
set
up
the
meeting
with
the
hope
of
convincing
microsoft
to
do
something
different
he
want
the
company
to
create
a
spreadsheet
program
for
the
mac
that
would
make
it
useful
to
business
much
like
visicalc
have
give
a
boost
to
the
apple
ii
in
their
meeting
he
and
gate
also
share
wildly
different
view
of
where
the
personal
computer
business
be
go
to
job
the
desktop
computer
be
for
intellectual
and
college
student
for
home
user
and
some
mix
of
middle
manager
and
secretary
each
machine
need
to
be
a
special
and
amaze
tool
to
improve
their
life
but
gate
saw
something
much
big
and
much
less
personal
to
him
the
computer
be
a
tool
to
help
business
run
well
he
saw
network
of
computer
work
together
to
help
business
communicate
calculate
and
sell
over
the
next
few
year
gate
s
vision
would
be
the
more
accurate
one
but
job
s
vision
be
the
one
that
prevail
at
apple
ibm
s
entrance
into
the
business
as
well
as
the
addition
of
more
software
and
big
memory
and
speedier
processor
spur
interest
in

rather
than
single
out
a

steve

the

say
it

more
than
anyone

kick
open
the

and
let
the

move
in
for
the
fiscal
year
that

in

company

churn
out
far
more

for
apple
other
computer
maker
rush
to
license
the
microsoft
operating

so
they
could
run
all
that
new

most

sing
the

song
that

as
the
ibm

those
that
didn

like
apple
face
an
uncertain
future
the
lisa
computer
which
have
cost
about
million
to

be
introduce
in
to
much
fanfare
it
be
the

computer
to
use
a

the

to

the

it
be
load
with

and
two
floppy

as
well
as
a
few
easy
to
use
program
that
come
with
it
while
most
software
at
the
time
might
take
day
to
learn
lisa
s
could
be
master
in
a
couple
of
hour
but
all
the
extra
have
bloat
the
price
to
and
there
be
no
other
software
available
the
tech
crowd
be
wowed
but
most
potential
customer
couldn
t
begin
to
justify
the
steep
price
while
job
promote
the
new
machine
to
the
press
he
couldn
t
resist
drop
hint
about
the
macintosh
interest
in
lisa
begin
to
cool
before
it
be
ever
available
since
people
knew
a
computer
with
similar
ability
be
come
out
for
much
less
money
to
make
matter
bad
software
for
the
lisa
wouldn
t
work
on
the
macintosh
in
addition
to
compete
with
ibm
one
apple
division
seem
to
be
battling
the
other
they
be
also
battling
microsoft
in
late
before
the
mac
would
be
formally
introduce
microsoft
announce
it
would
create
an
operating
system
for
ibm
and
its
copycat
call
window
that
would
incorporate
icon
window
and
a
mouse
just
like
the
mac
gate
have
promise
to
wait
a
year
after
the
mac
shipping
date
before
sell
so
call
graphical
interface
but
because
the
mac
have
slip
almost
a
year
behind
schedule
microsoft
be
catch
up
job
be
livid
and
summon
gate
to
apple
s
cupertino
headquarters
to
yell
at
him
in
front
of
apple
manager
but
gate
couldn
t
be
rattle
well
steve
i
think
there
s
more
than
one
way
of
look
at
it
he
told
job
and
others
in
the
conference
room
i
think
it
s
more
like
we
both
have
this
rich
neighbour
name
xerox
and
i
broke
into
his
house
to
steal
the
tv
set
and
found
that
you
have
already
steal
it
it
would
actually
take
microsoft
many
year
to
truly
compete
with
apple
though
that
didn
t
calm
job
down
job
still
believe
his
baby
alone
would
lead
a
computer
revolution
at
a
retreat
the
month
that
lisa
be
launch
he
implore
the
mac
team
to
work
even
harder
with
a
few
pithy
slogan
real
artist
ship
he
told
them
meaning
they
could
no
longer
let
deadline
slip
but
have
to
get
their
product
out
and
he
write
it
s
well
to
be
a
pirate
than
join
the
navy
imply
that
his
rebellious
group
s
technology
be
much
well
than
what
everyone
else
be
offering

efficient
manufacturing
method
so
he
could
sell
it
to
the
mass
at
an
affordable
price
job
want
a
computer
for
the
mass
as
well
one
that
be
design
for
the
user
not
for
the
geek
in
corporate
tech
department
to
fulfil
that
dream
he
want
to
price
the

compare
it
to
try

some
critic
call
the
mac
a
beige
toaster
bad
in
early
apple
bombed
with
another
costly
super

corporate
personal
computer
user
be
portrayed
as
lemming
follow
one
another
off
a
cliff
the

be
see
as
an
insult
to
the
people
who
bought
most
personal
computer
and
it
left
a
sour
taste
behind
in
early
job
turn
thirty
throw
a
fancy
dinner
dance
for
three
hundred
people
with
singer

as
the

his

brought
him
special
present
fine
wine
crystal
a
first
edition
book
and
even
a
frame
share
of
ibm

but
he
left
them
all
in
a
hotel
room
he
wasn
t
much
interested
in
those
material
thing
around
that
time
he
sat
down
for
a
long
magazine
interview
apple
s

which
have
peaked
at
about
a

during
the

the
value
of
job
s
stock
have
fall
more
than
million
from
a
peak
above
million
he
laugh
at
the
enormous
loss
say
it
s
hardly
the
most
insightful
or
valuable
thing
that
s
happen
to
me
in
the
past
ten
year
he
have
be
think
about
an
old
hindu
say
for
the

you
make
your

for
the
last
thirty
year
of
your
life
your
habit
make
you
and
he
be
reflective
about
apple
almost
predict
that
major
change
be
ahead
i
hope
that
throughout
my
life
i
ll
sort
of
have
the
thread
of
my
life
and
the
thread
of
apple
weave
in
and
out
of
each
other
like
a
tapestry
there
may
be
a
few
year
when
i
m
not
there

i
ll
always

left
again
say
he
want
to
develop
a
new
kind
of
remote
control
he
be
also
upset
that
the
company
he
co
found
be
mostly
ignore
the
apple
ii
repeatedly
focus
on
the
new

in
the

when
the

woz
also
reveal
that

of
his

with

its

broke
into

the
richest
man
in

anyway
a
few
year
later
in
a
television
interview
he
be
brutally
blunt
in
describe
microsoft
they
just
have
no
taste
he
say
i
don
t
mean
that
in
a
small
way
i
mean
that
in
a
big
way
in
the
sense
that
they
don
t
think
of
original
idea
and
they
don
t
bring
much
culture
into
their
product
job
concede
that
microsoft
have
mostly
earn
its
success
but
he
add
i
have
a
problem
with
the
fact
that
they
just
make
really
third
rate
product
after
the
interview
he
apologise
to
gate
say
he
should
never
have
share
his
opinion
in
public
but
then
job
go
on
to
tell
a
reporter
that
he
thought
gate
be
a
bit
narrow
and
would
be
a
broader
person
if
he
have
go
off
to
an
ashram
when
he
be
young
by
the
late
s
apple
s
faithful
mac
owner
have
come
to
see
their

as
the
luke
skywalker
to
microsoft
s
darth
vader
in
the
ongoing
battle
for
computer
craftsmanship
and
friendliness
but
with
macintosh
sale
drop
like
a
rock
and
its
new
operating
system
up
in
the
air
microsoft
wouldn
t
commit
to
continue
to
make
its
popular
excel
and
word
program
for
mac
which
require
different
software
than
window
that
s
still
true
though
it
matter
a
lot
less
now
that
so
much
content

over
the

the
apple

a
good
business
for
microsoft
but
not
crucial
for
it
without

i
d
shut
it
down

but
job
true
to
his
original
vision

there

the
root
of

while
no
one
have
successfully
carve
out
a
market
just
for
people
he
didn
t
see
why
apple
couldn
t
after
all
he
say
the
gap
be
very
successful
as
a
retailer
and
it
didn
t
sell
suit
to
begin
work
on
a

turn
to
apple

jonathan
ive
know

pronounce
johnny
job
order
up
a
computer
that
sound
a

like
his

it
have
to
be
easy
to
use
include
a

work
right
out
of
the

cost
less

after
a
couple
of
rejection
by
the
bos
ive
s
team
come
up
with
a
box
shape
more
like
a
triangular
pillow
than
a
cube
encase
the
computer
and
the

in
a
translucent

invite
the

visit
a
jelly
bean
factory
to
learn
more
about
translucent
colour
and
settle
on
a
greenish
blue
hue
for
the
computer
itself
though
other
candy

would
be
add
later
job
be
thrill
with
his
out
of
the
box
creation
which
he
saw
as
the
essence
of
great
design
most
people
he
say
see
design
as
the
way
something
look
such
as
the
fabric
of
the
curtain
and
the
sofa
he
explain
but
to
him
design
be
the
fundamental
soul
of
a

just
what
a
product
look
like
or
how
it
feel
but
how
it
actually
work
he
say
so
the
new
machine
wasn
t
about
just
the
colour
or
translucence
or
the
shape
of
the

with
such
philosophical

up
with
thirty
eight

why
the

didn
t
work

he

he
insist
that
it

it

steve

a
typical
upbeat
speaker
in

with
colleague
and
occasionally
with

over
the
year
he
have
share
a
personal
philosophy
somebody
told
me
when
i
be
seventeen
to
live
each
day
as
if
it

make
enough
of
an
impression
that
he
repeat
it
to
the

he
remember
it
when
he
met
laurene
powell
at

out
of

year
the

kept
him
focus
on

say
prompt
him
to
shift
direction
when

his
personal
and

story
the
year
before
he
say

found
a
tumour
on
his
pancreas
and
initially
thought
he
might
have
just
three
to
six
month
to
live
but
a
biopsy
later
that
day
found
that
it
be
a
very
rare
kind
of
pancreatic
cancer
one
that
can
be
successfully
treat
with
surgery
i
have
the
surgery

i
m
fine
now
he
say
it
be
a
poignant
story
that
capture
the
audience
s
rapt
attention
but
it
wasn
t
quite
true
call
it
the
steve

would
give
me
a
shot
of
demerol
in

butt
and
eventually
i
would
pas
it
he
say
in
october
the
urologist
who
have
treat
him
ask
him

as
he
have
told
the

the
doctor
found
a
tumour
but
this
be
in
the
autumn
of
not
mid

it
be
about
the

chance
of
living
be
very
good
many
patient

or
more
after

but
surgery
for
this
cancer
be
no
small
thing
sometimes
it
involves
remove
the
tumour

rebuilt
to
the
horror
and
shock
of
his
family
his

top
leader

a
yes
or
a
no

his
personal
life
be
rarely
so
black
and
white
he
couldn
t
decide
to
be
a
father
to
lisa
and
he
struggle
to
decide
whether
to
marry
he
couldn
t
even
buy
a
sofa
in
the
same
way
he
couldn
t
come
to
term
with
his
need
for
surgery
instead
he
redouble
his
focus
on
his
vegan
diet
avoid
all
form
of
animal
base
food
in
favor
of

to
tinker
with
him
either
i
really
didn
t
want
them
to
open
up
my
body
he
say
later
meanwhile
his
family
and
the
tiny
group
of
friend
who
knew
about
the
situation
beg
him
to
reconsider
they
talk
to
him
regularly
they
ask
doctor
to
speak
with
him
his
wife
understood
his
concern
about
opening
up
his
body
but
try
to
convince
him
that
the
body
exists
to
serve
the
spirit
she
recruit
everyone
she
could
to
change
his
mind
include
his
sister
mona
simpson
it
be
very
traumatic
for
all
of
us
one
of
those
in
his
inner
circle
told
fortune
magazine
in
july
he
have
another
scan
and
the
news
wasn
t
good
the
tumour
appear
to
have
grown
and
maybe
spread
finally
job
change
his
mind
and
on
july
doctor
perform
a
modify
whipple
from
his
hospital
bed
the
next
day
job
sent
an
e
mail
to
employee
explain
his
rare
cancer
and
say
it
could
be
cure
by
surgery
if
caught
soon
enough
his
be
he
say
which
meant
he
wouldn
t
need
radiation
or
chemotherapy
he
promise
to
be
back
at
work
in
september
once
again
this
wasn
t
the
whole
story
during
surgery
doctor
found
the
cancer
have
spread
to
at
least
three
place
on
his
liver
do
delay
surgery
shorten
his
life
it
be
impossible
to
say
since
no
one
knew
if
the
cancer
already
have
spread
when
it
be
found
nine
month
earlier
job
begin
chemotherapy
and
that
wasn
t
the
only
complication
because
of
the
major
surgery
job
be
told
he
would
need
to
eat
frequent
meal
and
get
plenty
of
protein
include
those
from
meat
fish
and
whole
milk
product
but
as
a
vegetarian
or
vegan
for
most
of
his
life
he
have
avoid
those
food
and
he
would
continue
to
do
so
job
have
always
be
a
difficult
eater
over
the
year
he
frequently
sent
food
back
in
restaurant
as
inedible
and
even
as
an
adult
with
a
family
he
would
go
on
binge
eat
only
carrot
salad
with
lemon
or
just
apple
or
occasionally
fast
his
wife
who
also
have
be
a
vegan
begin
add
fish
and
other
protein
to
family
meal
in
the
hope
of
convincing
job
to
give
his
body
what
it
need
but
it
be
an
uphill
battle
use
the
late
technology
available
in
doctor
be
able
to
map
part
of
the
genetic
material
in
the
cancer
allow
them
to
use
very
specific
target
treatment
but
the
combination
of
the
impact
of
the
surgery
treatment
pain
medication
and
his
diet
issue
make
it
difficult
for
him
to
put
on
and
keep
on
weight
and
at
various
time
he
would
look
thin
and
gaunt
job
s
health
problem
create
big
challenge
for
apple
while
many
top
executive
would
prefer
to
keep
their
personal
problem
private
the
choice
isn
t
a
simple
one
when
a
company
s
stock
be
publicly
trade
under
security
law
company
be
require
to
disclose
information
to
investor
that
could
affect
the
company
s
future
performance
whether
it
s
strong
sale
of
a
new
product
problem
with
a
current
product
or
worry
about
the
ceo
after
all
investor
be
make
financial
decision
base
on
how
the
company
will
do
and
they
re
entitle
to
have
the
proper
information
to
make
those
choice
give
how
vitally
engage
job
be
at
apple
and
how
important
he
be
to
product
like
the
fast
sell
ipod
line
and
the
new
itunes
store
his
health
clearly
would
have
be
a
concern
but
there
be
no
hard
and
fast
rule
about
what
have
to
be
say
or
when
apple
never
disclose
that
job
postpone
his
surgery
for
month
after
his
diagnosis
that
come
out
only
when
fortune
report
it
in
a
long
critical
cover
story
in
neither
do
apple
disclose
that
the
cancer
have
spread
instead
the
only
public
information
come
from
job
s
untrue
e
mail
that
his
cancer
have
be
caught
early
and
he
wouldn
t
need
chemotherapy
later
when
the
cancer
recur
and
he
become
skeletally
thin
he
initially
claimed
he
have
a
hormone
imbalance
that
be
affect
his
digestion
a
lawyer
for
the
company
conclude
that
job
s
right
to
privacy
be
great
than
shareholder
right
to
know
fortune
report
as
long
as
he
could
continue
to
perform
his
duty
but
other
executive
have
be
much
more
upfront
with
their
investor
about
their
illness
the
battle
with
cancer
make
job
more
reflective
at
least
for
a
time
in
the
summer
of
just
before
his
surgery
he
met
with
steven
levy
of
newsweek
when
levy
pull
out
an
ipod
with
a
microphone
to

plastic
cover
on
it

ding
and
scrape
i

he
demand
that
the

so
that

would
take

down
so
when
job
begin
think
about
an

one
of
his

idea
be
to

be

critical
of

use
a
fake

call

that
be
a

tool
god
give
us
ten
stylus
he
say
wiggle
his

let
s
not
invent
another
aware
that
microsoft
be
work
on
a
tablet
that
use
a

he
ask
his

if
they
could
come
up
with
a
tablet
that
use
touch
and
didn
t
have
a
physical

the

already
work

expand
how

to
control
the
track
pad
on
a

the
macbook

and
be
study
whether
they
could
translate
that
ability
to
use
finger
on
a
screen
in
time
the
designer
do
create
what
they
call
multi
touch
allow
the
forefinger
and
thumb
to
open
up
or
pinch
in
to

i
thought
my
god
we
can
build
a

out
of

so
he
shelve
the

project
for
the
time
be
to
focus
on
a
phone
why
a

not
long
after
the
ipod
be
introduce
job
realise
that
more
and
more
function
be
go
to
end
up
on
cell
phone
people
didn
t
have
enough
hand

pocket
to
keep

of
all
their
gadget
business
people
might
have
a
cell
phone
for
call
a

for
e
mail
or
a
palm
handheld
to
keep
track
of
their
calendar
and
address
book
in
addition
to
an
ipod
for
music
it
be
an
overwhelm
amount
of
hardware
and
he
figure
that
someday
it
would
or
at
least
should
exist
all
in
a
single
package
at
the
time
however
phone
like
the
pre
ipod
music
player
be
way
too
clunky
and
complex
with
tiny
plastic
keyboard
the
touch
screen
could
show
a
keyboard
when
it
be
need
and
then
hide
it
when
the
user
want
to
surf
the

look
up
a
map
everybody
hate
their

that
s
not
a
good
thing
job
say
there
s
an
opportunity
there
that
be
particularly
true
for
a
company
like
his
which
make
bmw

be
willing

good
at

this

the
practice
know

his

he
also
go

only
a

business

in

industry
but
job
have
remade
several
he
wasn
t
the
creator
of
the
personal

but
he
be
the
voice
and
face
of
the
revolution
he
didn
t
make
the
wonderful
computer
animate
pixar
movie
but
he
make
them
happen
he
put
digital
music
and
the
internet
in

pocket
in
an
elegant
way
and
he
make
our
life
easy
by
insist
that
every
gadget
apple
make
and
thus
the
gadget
that
many
others
make
in
response
be
simple
and
fun
to
use
at
a
memorial
service
for
apple
employee
tim
cook
apple
s
new
ceo
say
that
one
of
the
lesson
job
taught
him
be
that
simple
can
be
harder
than
complex
you
have
to
work
hard
to
get
your
think
clear
enough
to
make
it
simple
but
it
s
worth
it
in
the
end
because
once
you
get
there
you
can
move
mountain
it
would
be
easy
to
get
hung
up
on
steve
job
s
quirkiness
and
to
focus
on
his
ugly
side
his
temper
tantrum
his
impatience
how
cold
and
uncaring
he
could
be
how
ridiculously
high
his
expectation
be
and
how
demand
he
be
of
those
around
him
even
simpson
note
in
her
eulogy
that
he
go
through
sixty
seven
nurse
before
find
three
he
trust
apple
ceo
tim
cook
speaks
at
the
memorial
service
for
steve
job
at
apple
headquarters
but
ultimately
he
be
like
his
product
his
macintosh
have
too
little
memory
and
no
cursor
key
his
imac
be
miss
a
floppy
drive
his
ipod
didn
t
have
an
on
off
switch
each
be
brilliant
and
also
flaw
but
you
could
overlook
the
very
real
imperfection
because
the
rest
of
the
package
be
so
amaze
many
executive
and
engineer
stayed
at
apple
for
year
endure
job
s
endless
demand
because
they
do
great
work
under
him
maybe
well
work
than
they
would
have
do
otherwise
as
much
as
he
push
them
job
didn
t
want
the
people
he
work
with
to
try
to
guess
what
he
want
or
to
try
to
be
him
among
the
last
advice
he
have
for
me
and
all
of
you
cook
say
be
to
never
ask
what
he
would
do
just
do
what
s
right
he
say
more
than
gadget
steve
job
left
the
lesson
that
he
spell
out
so
powerfully
in
his
stanford
speech
and
in
the
way
he
live
he
trust
that
the
dot
would
connect
he
believe
the
reward
be
in
the
journey
he
follow
his
heart
he
didn
t
settle
for
okay
he
do
what
he
love
and
if
he
didn
t
love
what
he
do
if
he
didn
t
believe
it
be
great
work
he
redid
it
again
and
again
he
try
to
live
each
day
as
though
it
really
matter
even
before
he
have
cancer
oh
and
there
be
one
other
thing
in
a
interview
and
again
at
the
stanford
graduation
he
recall
the
whole
earth
catalog
an
unusual
publication
that
be
popular
when
he
be
in
high
school
in
the
final
issue
he
remember
the
back
cover
have
a
photo
of
a
remote
country
road
the
caption
read
stay
hungry
stay
foolish
and
now
he
say
i
wish
that
for
you
stay
hungry
stay
foolish
