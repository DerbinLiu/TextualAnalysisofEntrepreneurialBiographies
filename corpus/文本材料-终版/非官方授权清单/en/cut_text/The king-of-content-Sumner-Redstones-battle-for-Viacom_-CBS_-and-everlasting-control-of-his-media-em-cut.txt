afternoon
in

chief

philippe
dauman
drove
through
the
heavy
metal
gate
of
the
exclusive
beverly
park
neighborhood
overlook
beverly
hill
past
the
olympian
estate
of
movie
star
like
sylvester
stallone
and
eddie
murphy
and
up
to
the
sprawl
butter
color
mansion
of
his
longtime
bos
and
mentor
sumner
redstone
such
visit
have
long
be
a
monthly
routine
for
the
lifelong
manhattanite
who
ran
the
new
york
base
public
company
that
the
ninety
two
year
old
sumner
overwhelmingly
control
usually
the
two
former
lawyer
would
mix
business
talk
with
reminiscence
of
their
past
corporate
conquest
watch
a
little
baseball
or
cnbc
and
gaze
at
the
giant
aquarium
of
sumner
s
beloved
saltwater
fish
but
on
this
day
dauman
have
come
to
discus
a
particularly
delicate
matter
viacom
be
consider
sell
nearly
half
of
paramount
picture
the
glamorous
hollywood
studio
whose
takeover
in
have
define
both
men
s
career
they
have
wrest
it
from
rival
medium
titan
barry
diller
and
john
malone
in
an
epic
bidding
war
and
own
america
s
old
continuously
run
studio
the
home
of
the
godfather
chinatown
and
the
indiana
jones
series
have
cement
sumner
s
status
as
a
mogul
yet
viacom
s
stock
have
be
in
a
tailspin
lose
half
its
value
during
the
previous
two
year
and
investor
be
clamor
for
some
kind
of
dramatic
action
some
big
chinese
company
have
gotten
hollywood
s
attention
in
the
last
few
month
with
their
interest
in
studio
and
it
seem
like
a
good
moment
to
capitalize
on
the
century
old
paramount
s
romantic
allure
even
if
it
too
have
be
in
a
year
long
slump
after
one
prospective
buyer
express
interest
in
a
deal
that
value
the
beleaguer
studio
at
more
than
billion
more
than
twice
what
most
analyst
thought
it
be
worth
dauman
want
to
explore
a
joint
venture
perhaps
the
right
partner
could
not
only
provide
the
cash
paramount
desperately
need
to
restock
its
nearly
bare
cupboard
of
franchise
but
also
help
the
studio
s
movie
get
well
access
to
international
market
in
an
era
when
percent
of
hollywood
s
movie
revenue
come
from
overseas
he
knew
it
would
be
a
hard
pitch
redstone
be
an
amasser
not
a
divester
and
few
thing
have
brought
him
great
pleasure
over
the
last
two
decade
than
his
intimate
dinner
at
dan
tana
s
or
the
ivy
with
paramount
s
management
albeit
often
at
the
inelegantly
geriatric
hour
of
five
p
m
to
own
a
studio
in
hollywood
be
to
be
a
king
a
status
beyond
money
and
paramount
be
not
just
any
studio
it
be
the
original
hollywood
monopoly
the
creator
of
the
studio
system
business
model
and
the
first
studio
to
take
sumner
seriously
when
he
be
nothing
more
than
the
executive
vice
president
of
his
father
s
drive
in
theater
chain
dauman
s
task
would
also
be
challenge
because
communication
with
sumner
these
day
be
nearly
impossible
the
mogul
who
have
once
famously
declare
that
viacom
be
me
have
suffer
a
precipitous
decline
in
his
health
in
eerie
parallel
with
viacom
s
stock
price
after
an
episode
of
inhale
food
into
his
lung
in
that
have
left
him
dependent
on
a
feed
tube
and
barely
able
to
speak
a
few
month
earlier
his
former
live
in
companion
have
allege
he
be
completely
non
compos
mentis
unable
to
follow
the
thread
of
a
conversation
or
the
plot
of
a
film
and
a
few
month
after
this
visit
dauman
himself
would
make
a
similar
charge
but
for
now
he
try
to
communicate
with
sumner
the
way
he
have
be
for
month
by
do
his
best
to
interpret
his
grunt
often
visitor
to
the
mansion
get
help
decipher
sumner
s
speech
from
his
nurse
jeremy
jagiello
dubbed
the
sumner
whisperer
but
dauman
s
task
be
too
sensitive
for
that
for
month
he
have
assume
that
the
mansion
be
either
bug
or
fill
with
spy
loyal
to
his
longtime
rival
sumner
s
daughter
shari
redstone
shari
and
dauman
both
sixty
one
have
long
compete
for
the
role
of
sumner
s
heir
apparent
but
in
recent
year
dauman
seem
to
have
definitively
clinched
the
prize
as
shari
s
relationship
with
her
father
deteriorate
that
have
all
change
since
the
fall
however
when
the
two
live
in
companion
half
sumner
s
age
to
whom
the
mogul
have
bequeath
some
million
whom
shari
refer
to
as
her
father
s
little
slut
be
thrown
out
of
the
mansion
pave
the
way
for
shari
to
reconcile
with
her
father
dauman
have
be
concerned
enough
about
shari
that
he
have
announce
his
visit
when
he
be
just
twenty
minute
away
in
order
to
avoid
give
his
east
coast
rival
enough
time
to
get
on
a
plane
and
position
herself
next
to
her
father
through
their
meeting
just
as
sumner
s
former
companion
have
do
with
all
of
sumner
s
visitor
during
the
two
year
before
their
ejection
still
he
assume
correctly
that
anything
jagiello
heard
would
be
relayed
back
to
shari
so
as
he
walk
in
to
find
sumner
watch
television
in
the
fish
room
the
sit
room
line
with
aquarium
scale
fish
tank
he
ask
jagiello
if
he
could
step
into
the
next
room
so
that
he
and
sumner
could
discus
some
sensitive
corporate
information
the
nurse
be
not
allow
to
let
sumner
out
of
their
sight
in
case
they
have
to
jump
in
and
suction
from
his
throat
the
saliva
that
be
constantly
threaten
to
choke
him
but
jagiello
move
through
the
open
doorway
between
the
aquarium
dauman
pull
a
chair
up
next
to
sumner
so
that
jagiello
could
only
see
his
back
and
lean
in
close
to
whisper
his
news
he
ask
sumner
if
he
have
understood
him
and
sumner
nod
a
few
day
later
dauman
held
a
board
call
to
discus
the
paramount
stake

worried
about
leak
he
have
not
told
anyone
in
advance
not
even
paramount
chairman
brad
grey
what
the
call
be
about
as
he
have
expect
jagiello
have
told
shari
about
the
visit

whisper
and

nod
and

repeatedly
in
the
hour
lead
up
to
the
board

about

with
the
exception
of

so
personally
shape
the
company
he
control

when
his
frustration

murdoch
he
have
inherit
a
regional
company
from
his
father
and
turn
it
into
a
global

like
murdoch
he
sought
to
continue
this
control
by
passing
it
on
to
his
child
but
the

ruthlessness
that

make
him
a
terrible

sue
him
for
unfairly
shut
him
out
of
the

and
use
the
company
as
a
private
piggy
bank
his
relationship
with
his
daughter
shari
have
run
hot
and
cold
for
decade
at
one
point
become
so
strain
that
they
communicate
only
by

fare
little
well
sumner
have
also
square
off
in
court
against
his
brother
eddie
his
nephew
michael
his
wife
phyllis
and
his
granddaughter
keryn
the
theme
run
through
much
of
the
litigation
be
sumner
s
obsession
for
total
control
of
the
family
business
and
his
willingness
to
push
aside
anyone
he
have
to
include
indeed
especially
his
own
flesh
and
blood
to
get
it
but
again
and
again
what
threaten
this
control
most
be
not
his
family
but
his
tumultuous
love
life
when
his
philander
make
his

of
fifty
two
year
phyllis

time

which
would
operate
it
it
be
quite
a
coup
for
a
thirty
six

old
father
of
two
who
have
neither
the

the

be
there
any
word
about
how
rothstein
come
into
that
money
not
until
year
later
would
it
emerge
that
he
have
a
silent
partner
harry
doc
sagansky
a
boston

at
that

put

into
the
theater
start
with
the

but
for
obvious
reason
sagansky
remain
in
the
background
and
so
it
be
left
to
rothstein
to
be
the
barker
while

to
the

popular
rothstein
note
because
they
take

off

reduce

a
somewhat
peculiar
pitch

another

he
evidently
want
to
be
different
with

the

be
a
crucially
important
mechanism
for

beyond

just
two
year
later
he
move

this
be
how
his

first
remembers
him
my

i
have
a
clear
picture
of
him
in

tot
a

over
his

carry
it
out
to
the

sumner
write

then
more
dubiously
with

he
brought
in
he
support
not
only
my

me
and
my
young

edward

his
own
parent
and
my

as
well
there
s
little
evidence
to
suggest
this

if

an
inexpensive

serve
a
full
dinner
for

and
be
naughty
enough
for
grownup
but
tame
enough
for
family
my
father
toyed
at
first
with
use
the
congo

paint
on
the

and
a
chorus
line
of
pretend
native
dance
girl
his
next
idea
be
to
re
create
a
more
bohemian
club
like
those
in
new

s
artsy
greenwich

with
a
chorus
line
of
american
girl
transport
to
paris
he
decide
to
do
the
same
thing
in
reverse
he
would
bring
paris
to
boston
no
bank
would
give
him
a
loan
for
a

she
writes
so
he
scrap
together

he
get
his
liquor
license
by
call
his

call
his
close
friend
then

he
spent
the
week
before
the
opening
melt
candle
wax
around
the
neck
of
empty
wine
bottle
to
create
a
parisian
ambience
it
be
an
instant
success
there
be
two
show
nightly
feature
singer
acrobat
and
the
occasional
comedian
but
the
main
attraction
be
the
chorus
line
of
barely
clothed
besequined
girl
whom
walter
have
recruit
from
local
dance
school
he
call
them
his
petite
mamzelles
for
the
finale
his

deep
split
raise
their
skirt
over
their
head
and
show
their
ruffle

the
formula
work
so
well
that
walter
take
it
to
miami
and
eventually
in
april
to

obviously
these

it
be
on
the

that
kill
nearly
five

simultaneously
he

as
he
unveiled
his

he
argue
that
it
span
not
just
the

also
night

that

at

she

i

not
sure
how
much
fun
she
get
out
of

there
be
only
one

one

that

i
be
i
be
her
pride
and
her
focus
one
of
sumner
s
most
repeat
story
be
of
his

turn
the

to
trick
him
into
practice
the

her
as

as
anyone
else
get
along
with
her
he
say
she

nervous
wreck
he
add
that
she
didn
t
give
of
herself
to
her

and
probably
didn
t
know
how
my

brittle
insecure
woman
say
gary
snyder
no

have

with
a

that
bound
beyond

do
not
help
sumner
credit
his
mother
s
obsessive
drive
for
propel
him
into
and
more
importantly
through
boston
latin
school
which
he
call
the
most
rigorous
and
competitive
experience
i
have
ever
have
and
that
include
business
more
than
poverty
more
than
his
mother
s
focus
attention
it
be
boston
latin
school
that
shape
both
sumner
s
combativeness
and
his
transcendent
sense
of
his
own
potential
that
make
him
in
essence
a
killer
even
today
it
be
impossible
to
walk
into
the

without
feel
a

of
awe
of

as
many
student
of

would
say
of
dread
found
in
boston
latin
school
be
the
old
school
in
the
united

a
year
old
than
harvard
nearly
a
century

half

not

that

the
more
direct
message
deliver
to
student
of

generation
be
that
they
could
expect
the

issue
half
my

bad
when

when
i
graduate
this

and
walk
out
the
front
door
with

leave
little

for

i
can
name
four
people
in
my
six
year
here
that
we
have
general
conversation
contompasis
say
it
just
didn
t
happen
sumner
seem
to
have
be
both
traumatize
and
fortify
by
the
experience
which
set
pattern
that
would
remain
for
his
entire
life
i
have
no
social
life
i
have
no
friend
i
knew
people
only
because
i
sat
next
to
them
in
class
or
because
they
be
my
closest
competitor
for
the
school
award
he
write
in
his
autobiography
i
do
nothing
but
study
throughout
high
school
i
don
t
remember
eat
the
primary
lesson
i
learn
at
boston
latin
be
that
life
be
rough
that
tension
be
frequently
crush
and
that
the
only
hope
that
count
be
the
hope
that
lie
within
each
individual
his
first
year
he
caught
scarlet
fever
which
kept
him
out
of
school
for
week
a
terrify
prospect
i
don
t
remember
be
scar
of
die
he
write
i
do
remember
be
terrorize
by
the
fact
that
i
be
miss
class
his
mother
who
have
become
close
to
his
homeroom
teacher
and
the
school
s
future
headmaster
wilfred
o
leary
brought
him
book
and
he
end
up
win
the
school
s
classic
prize
and
modern
prize
for
the
year
and
every
year
after
that
over
many
decade
of
be
profile
in
the
press
sumner
would
repeat
some
version
of
the
boast
that
he
go
on
to
graduate
with
the
high
grade
point
average
in
the
three
hundred
year
history
of
boston
latin
as
best
it
be
possible
to
tell
this
seem
to
be
a
hyperbolic
flourish
of
the
mickey
redstone
school
of
personal
promotion
when
sumner
graduate
they
do
not
keep
grade
point
average
contompasis
say
what
i
can
tell
you
be
he
do
have
an
outstanding
academic
record
it
be
probably
in
the
top
percent
of
his
class
but
he
would
get
his
name
on
the
wall
of
the
auditorium
albeit
not
yet
on
the
upper
frieze
the
low
wall
be
individual
who
have
make
significant
contribution
not
only
to
their
particular
profession
but
who
have
also
give
back
to
the
school
contompasis
say
sumner
be
on
the
wall
because
he
be
a
donor
to
the
school
although
sumner
maintain
a
nearly
lifelong
indifference
to
fancy
some
might
even
say
decent
clothes
and
developed
a
taste
for
grand
house
only
later
in
life
he
would
ultimately
learn
that
money
be
an
essential
component
to
satisfy
the
crave
for
glory
and
power
that
boston
latin
have
foster
in
him
but
before
he
come
to
this
realization
he
would
set
out
into
the
world
determine
to
satisfy
it
in
what
he
believe
be
a
more
noble
way
through
public
service
he
have
excel
at
debate
at
boston
latin
and
enter
harvard
on
scholarship
bound
for
its
debate
council
and
ultimately
for
harvard
law
school
where
he
would
follow
in
the
footstep
of
his
mother
s
father
and
become
a
lawyer
when
he
pass

could
not
simply
leave
the

at
that
he
go

that
in

mid

while
out
in

represent

that
be

of

sumner
claimed
that
this

then
introduce
him
to
bugsy
siegel
the
infamous
jewish

and
i
saw
life
in
a
very
different
way
this
story
cannot
be
true
however
as
siegel
rather
famously
get
a
pair
of
bullet
in
the
head
while
sit
on
his

ironically
this

probably
unwittingly
reveal
sumner

present
his
work

indeed
sumner
describes
his
decision
to
go
work
for
his
father

when

reach
that
conclusion
i
decide

into

for
myself
that
s
an
odd
way
of
phrasing
what

control
the
redstones
bought
the

under

rise

and
s
by
the
late

the

have
determine
that
land
value
be
too
high
to
continue
buying
and
building

in
so
they
switch
to
a
strategy
of
lease
land
in

which
provide
enough
parking
for
a

without
have
to

this
let
the
smith
expand

become
the

operator

by

the

just
percent
of

drive

maintain
operational
control
through
a

with

i
never

even
the

richard

differently
in
the
redstones
first
major
pitch
for

after
form
national
amusement
sumner
drew
an
explicit
contrast
with
the
smith
strategy
while
others
be
building

sumner
told
the
banker
where
someone
else
be

we

we

this
approach
would
end
up
make

later
one
person
close
to
michael

he
use
to
describe
his
early
memory
as
be
kick
in
the
face
by
his
mother

accord
to

aggressive
behavior
michael
s
presence
in
the
home
be
put
a
great
strain
on
the
family
so
in
when
he
be
just
nine
year
old
they
sent
him
to
boarding
school
at
fessenden
one
of
a
small
group
of
junior
boarding
school
that

boarder
before

in
the
kennedy
clan
and
locate
in
west
newton
close
to
his

but
michael
regard
it
as
a
betrayal
and
as
an
institutionalization
he
be
expel
on
november
eddie
and
leila
be
near
the
end
of
their
rope
they
enrol
him
in
another
boarding

and
begin
to
discus
with
dr
walzer
what
they
could
do
to
in
the
word
of
one
person
close
to
the
family
try
to
get
him
straighten
out
their
solution
would
trigger
a
series
of

that
would
lead

the
breakup
of
both
the

to
another
michael

not

year
old
but
already
world
weary
well
acquaint
with

the
think
be
that
the
brisk
maine
air
would
do
him
good
in
fact
it
have
be
the
recommendation
of

his
summer
as
the
doctor
at
camp
powhatan

of
the
old
jewish
summer
camp
in
maine
that
he
give

a
try

it
be
also
simply
what
nice
jewish
boy
from

do
in
the
summer
head
north
to
the
pristine
forest
of
vermont
new

especially
maine
to
build

would
help
them
succeed
in
society
in
general
these

my

like
my

eddie
have
toyed
with
the
idea
of
leave
the

business
for
year
but
his
mother
father
or
brother
have
always
coaxed
him
back
into
the
fold
but
as
he
and
leila
be
preoccupy
with
michael
s
mental
health
crisis
eddie
begin
to

with
a
r

stretch

operation
that
have
previously
be
eddie
s
job
eddie
be
livid
and
in
june
he
quit
he
demand
his
share
which
be
kept
at
national
amusement
headquarters
in
dedham
but
his
father
refuse
to
hand
over
the
stock
certificate
argue
that
national
amusement
have
the
right
of
first
refusal
to
buy
back
the
share
mickey
and
his
lawyer
then
invent
a
new
reason
why
eddie
couldn
t
have
his
share
that
half
of
them
have
actually
be
held
in
an
oral
trust
for
michael
and
ruth
ann
ever
since
mickey
doled
them
out
in
the
oral
trust
argument
be
ingenious
for
several
reason
on
its
face
it
rest
on
the
at
least
somewhat
provable
fact
that
mickey
have
put
in
percent
of
the
stock
at
the
time
of
national
amusement
found
but
only
receive
percent
of
the
share
give
mickey
ground
for
claim
he
have
additional
say
over
what
his
son
do
with
their
share
second
the
lack
of
a
paper
trail
and
there
be
none
do
not
disprove
the
existence
of
an
oral
trust
third
the
trust
structure
would
let
mickey
and
belle
voice
their
reservation
about
eddie
s
parent
choice
and
fourth
since
sumner
would
become
the
trustee
of
these
trust
it
would
keep
the
asset
under
family
control
for
longer
while
ensure
that
the
transfer
of
wealth
would
completely
bypass

mickey

he
would

eddie
try

not

throughout
the
letter

not
at
the

have
always
be
cagey
about
his

in
the
dispute
in
his

he
be
open
about
how
his
father
s
decision

he
deny

any
role
in
push
his
brother
out

on
the
contrary
when

plead
with

everything
to
gain
by

while
you
be
at

it
will
provide
you
with
a
base
of
operation
during
his
testimony
in
a
lawsuit
that
his
nephew
michael
brought
against
him
in
sumner
repeat
the
story
about
beg
eddie
to
stay
and
say
he
didn
t
remember
hire
anyone
to
replace
him
in
june
add
my
father
would
have
probably
make
the
decision
but
in
the
next
breath
when
ask
whether
his
father
be
still
make
the
principal
decision
in
the
business
in
and
he
reply
i
m
not
sure
that
s
true
at
a
certain
point
my
father
get
a
bag
of
golf
club
and
start
spending
his
time
with
my
blessing

be
good
for
him
he
have
work
hard
all
his
life
start
play
a
lot
of
golf
and
at
that
point
i
pretty
much
take
over
in
his
testimony
he
characterize
the
fight
as
be
between
his
father
and
his
brother
he
be
sympathetic
to
his
brother
s
view
that
he
have
no
restriction
on
his
stock
but
he
also
agree
with
the
general
thrust
of
his
father
s
wish
that
eddie
set
aside
stock
for
his
own
child
i
myself
have
the
sense
that
our
company

heritage
and
culture
be
that
the
stock

from
generation
to
generation

people
close

he

insulate
from
the

he
spent
a
little
more
than
a

at

attend
its
accredit
southard
school
for
emotionally
disturbed
adolescent
during

michael

i

they
assess
damage
michael
say
the
lawyer
that
michael
found
in
the
phone
book
in
turn
call
a
local
lawyer
name
ralph
skoog
who
file
a
suit
to
get
michael
out
of
menninger
he
didn
t
want
to
be
out
there
at
the
menninger
school
and
didn
t
think
that
he
belong
there
so
we
brought
an
action
in
the
court
to
determine
he
be
correct
they
didn
t
have
any
power
to
keep
him
there
against
his
wish
skoog
say
add
we
be
in
the
transition
at
the
time
from
when

be
suppose
to
do
what
their

tell

to
do
until

too
the
first
person
from
michael

hand
behind
the
whole
process
of
get
michael
on
his
foot
eddie
and
leila
be
not
there
which
be
probably
just
as
well
i
think
we
establish
at
trial
that
leila
be
probably
mentally
ill
and
their
two
child
end
up
get
the
brunt
of
it
skoog
say
as
far
as
eddie
go
he
support
his
wife
instead
of
his

michael
end
up
stay
with
skoog
a
father
of
five
for
about
six
week
during
which
skoog
say
he
saw
no
sign
of
mental
illness
i
don
t
know
if
there
be
anything
wrong
with
him
except
that
he
be
treat
so
strangely
that
he
respond
like
kid
do
sometimes
who
be
strong
will
i
never
notice
that
he
have
any
difficulty
except
that
his
response
to
thing
be
different
occasionally
than
my
child
s
would
have
be
skoog
say
he
do
not
remember
what
diagnosis
if
any
michael
be
give
at
menninger
but
he
believe
his
parent
put
him
there
in
part
because
he
like
a
lot
of
youngster
have
smoke
some

woodstock
personally
the
concept
of
woodstock
to
me

repulsive
but
i
have
no
right
to
impose
my
view
on
other
people
michael
believe
he
be
in
menninger
because
his
parent
didn
t
want
to
deal
with
him
he
thought
they
be
all
involve
with
themselves

their

a
burden
and
they

primarily
he

push
me
to

organize
about

michael

about

to
screw
around
and
stuff

nobody
have
ever
paid
attention
to
me
before
so
i
be
appreciative
these
pep

would
continue
through
the
next
few
year
as
michael
move

the
most
from

to
the
tenacity
of
sumner
redstone
plus
very
artful
dealing
with
the
distributor
class
among
the
most
useful
asset
that
sumner
brought
to
these
dealing
be
his
photographic
memory

him
something

in
an

rife
with

sumner
stood
out
his
prominence
as
a
train
lawyer
make
him
both
uniquely
fear
within
and
uniquely
valuable
to

at

to
lead
the

s
fight
against

bidding
the

of
require
theater

to
bid
for
the
right
to
show
a
first
run

before
they
have
the
chance
to
see
it
the
doj
put
a
few
mild
restriction
on
the
practice
but
in
the
matter
make
it
to
federal
court
where
sumner
represent
nato
personally
argue
that
the
practice
be
discriminatory
since
some
big
exhibitor
with
good
relation
with
the
film
company
he
didn
t
say
it
but
like
himself
would
always
have
an
advantage
over
small
player
who
remain
in
the
dark
about
how
good
the
movie
they
be
buying
be
the
argument
fell
mostly
on
deaf
ear
however
so
sumner
continued
to
lead
the
fight
at
the
state
level
where
nato
and
other
exhibitor
group
be
try
to
get
state
legislature
to
ban
the
practice
in
april
sumner
go
before
the
new
york
state

in
the
difficult
final

of

at
one
point
lash
out
at

that

be
sumner

though
his
strong
resemblance
to

rebuts
the
argument
the

be
the
cause
of
domestic
battle
in
both
newton
home
make
all
the
more
awkward
because
shari
and
brent
be
roughly
the
same
age
as
delsa
s
elder
child
and
all
of
the
child
knew
each
other
socially
still
sumner
be
not
about
to
follow
delsa
to
divorce
court
as
much
as
delsa
be
the
love
of
sumner
s
life
he
be
still
emotionally
bound
to
phyllis
family
friend
say
in
much
the
same
way
he
have
be
emotionally
bound
to
his
own
mother
soon
after
delsa
s
divorce
she
and
sumner
begin
to
talk
about
get
a
house
together
where
they
could
live
essentially
as
husband
and
wife
though
it
would
be
many
year
before
they
follow
through
delsa
have
no
desire
to
get
remarry
which
make
sumner
s
own
marital
status
less
important
so
they
simply
agree
that
they
would
build
a
life
together
and
so
since
there
be
no
outward
sign
beyond
delsa
s
divorce
that
anything
be
go
on
phyllis
put
up
with

extent
accepted

mickey
do
it
doc
sagansky
do
it
why
would
sumner
be
any
different
he
always
struck
me
as
the
guy
who
be
go
to
cheat
no
matter
what
relationship
he
s
in
wittman
say
the

be
tolerate

worthwhile
way

told
the
boston

in
his
first
major
newspaper

in
march
but
as
the
profile
wore
on
it
become
clear
that
sumner
s
regret
be
not
about
have
be
insufficiently
philanthropic
rather
it
be
that
he
have
spent
so
long
stuck
in
the
clunky
caboose
of
the

his

persona
come

relentless

be
to
join

we
sometimes
wish
we
be
they
and
they
be
us
he
say
by
then
of
course
he
be
already
on
his
way
to
take
control
of
the

industry
s

he
have
already
turn

rather
curiously
doling
out
increasingly
dour
prediction
about
the
prospect
of
his
own

as
early
as
he
saw
the

of

as
well
as
the
threat
it
augur
for
movie
theater
owner
despite
what
others
have
say
the
fact
remains
that
the
average
person
will
before
too
long
be
able
to
punch
out
one
of
perhaps
possibility
on
his
television
set
which
also
will
be
different
in
term
of
size
and
resolution

this
fact
will
have
to
affect
exhibition
perhaps
drastically
there
s
an
enormous
revolution
go
on
today
and
i
don
t
know
if
most

be
as
aware
of
it
as
they
should

laybourne
say

little
do
they
know
that
in
march
six
month
before
their
fail
leveraged
buyout
a
boston
theater
chain
owner
in
his
sixty
have
begin
quietly
buying
up
viacom
stock
as
a
hedge
against
the
lack
of
growth
in
his
own
industry
by
now
sumner
redstone
be
an
icon
in
boston
and
the
exhibition
industry
and
a
respect
figure
among
his
fellow
investor
but
virtually
unknown
beyond
these
realm
but
an
interview
with
the
boston
globe
that
spring
suggest
he
be
not
content
to
keep
it
this
way
what
have
really
driven
me
though
be
the
desire
to
do
whatever
i
do
well
than
anyone
else
he
say
i
enjoy
recognition
nearly
a
year
later
in
may
a
corporate
raider
who
be
a
household
name
carl
icahn
make
what
at
first
appear
to
be
a
play
for
viacom
buying
up
a
percent
stake
in
the
company
and
say
he
d
be
willing
to
buy
the
whole
thing
in
the
end
icahn
s
move
turn
out
to
be
merely
greenmail
meaning
he
be
willing
to
go
away
after
the
company
bought
back
his
share
at
a
high
price
than
he
bought
them
for
so
when
sumner
mickey
korff
and
national
amusement
ramped
up
their
holding
in
viacom
to
percent
over
the
course
of
the
summer
of
most
of
wall
street
write
it
off
as
just
another
greenmail
attempt
although
viacom
have
be
widely
recognize
as
a
takeover
target
national
amusement
isn
t
a
likely
suitor
the
wall
street
journal
write
soothingly
mr
redstone
frequently
make
sizable
investment
in
entertainment
company
and
in
most
case
have
cordial
relationship
with
management
terry
elkes
however
wasn
t
take
any
chance
sumner
s
grow
stake
and
the
icahn
greenmail
spook
him
so
he
and
other
top
manager
put
together
a
billion
bid
to
take
viacom
private
through
a
leveraged
buyout
sumner
woke
up
on
the
morning
of
september
and
read
about
it
in
the
new
york
time
and
hit
the
roof
the
bid
be
only
about
a
share
above
viacom
stock
s
trading
price
of
a
share
which
sumner
felt
be
far
too
low
give
the
potential
that
lay
within
the
content
engine
of
mtv
and
showtime
he
thought
they
be
try
to
steal
the
company
away
i
don
t
like
it
i
think
it
s
worth
a
lot
more
recall
philippe
dauman
then
a
young
associate
at
shearman
sterling
whom
sumner
have
hire
that
summer
to
help
with
the
regulatory
paperwork
require
when
investor
cross
the
percent
threshold
of
ownership
in
a
public
company
during
a
interview
the
son
of
french
immigrant
and
raise
in
manhattan
dauman
be
dark
eyed
diminutive
and
coolly
formal
with
a
penchant
for
elegant
european
tailor
and
a
raw
intellectual
brilliance
that
rival
sumner
s
own
he
have
skip
directly
from
kindergarten
to
third
grade
score
a
perfect
score
on
his
sat
at
age
thirteen
and
enter
yale
at
sixteen
like
sumner
he
didn
t
find
the
ivy
league
undergraduate
experience
much
of
a
challenge
so
he
spent
most
of
his
time
play
poker
and
backgammon
hone
a
love
for
craftily
separate
his
peer
from
their
money
that
he
would
bring
into
his
professional
life
as
a
merger
and
acquisition
lawyer
a
youth
spent
surround
by
classmate
much
old
and
taller
also
instill
a
quality
that
would
endear
him
to
redstone
who
be
then
use
to
underling
quake
before
him
as
if
he
be
an
angry
volcano
dauman
be
utterly
unafraid
it
be
obvious
from
the
begin
that
philippe
and
sumner
have
an
affinity
recall
steve
volk
dauman
s
bos
at
shearman
sterling
sumner
listen
to
him
threw
a
lot
of
question
at
him
and
like
the
way
philippe
answer
them
there
be
just
a
chemistry
between
them
even
though
dauman
be
just
thirty
two
year
old
and
not
yet
a
partner
sumner
request
to
deal
directly
with
him
and
soon
they
be
on
the
phone
multiple
time
a
day
begin
with
a
routine
call
from
sumner
to
dauman
s
home
each
day
at
five
a
m
dauman
train
to
work
through
the
night
on
big
deal
have
gotten
good
at
fake
an
alert
voice
even
when
summon
from
slumber
and
appear
to
sumner
to
be
keep
the
same
hour
as
his
restless
client
eventually
dauman
told
sumner
that
he
be
wake
up
his
wife
and
sumner
agree
to
put
off
the
call
until
seven
a
m
within
twenty
four
hour
of
reading
of
management
s
buyout
attempt
sumner
have
decide
to
go
to
war
with
dauman
at
his
side
he
immediately
bought
more
stock
and
hire
merrill
lynch
the
one
major
banking
outfit
that
the
viacom
management
have
not
tie
up
with
its
own
bid
to
explore
how
he
would
go
about
financing
a
takeover
no
one
include
sumner
be
quite
sure
of
his
intention
but
as
he
continued
to
ramp
up
his
holding
viacom
s
stock
price
soar
above
management
s
initial
offer
force
them
to
sweeten
it
meanwhile
sumner
put
on
his
best
country
bumpkin
routine
a
pose
he
would
employ
frequently
in
the
ensue
year
to
ensure
his
rival
underestimated
him
it
s
a
whole
new
world
he
marvel
to
the
new
york
time
it
be
not
long
ago
that
all
i
knew
about
leveraged
buyout
be
that
they
be
refer
to
as
l
b
o
s
i
m
much
more
educate
now
on
october
he
make
one
last
effort
to
convince
management
to
keep
viacom
a
public
company
but
when
the
board
vote
the
next
day
to
approve
management
s
sweeten
bid
the
battle
line
be
set
management
own
just
percent
of
the
company
s
equity
far
less
than
sumner
own
and
be
have
to
rely
on
high
interest
junk
bond
to
finance
their
bid
he
say
these
guy
be
go
to
take
over
the
company
for
less
money
than
we
already
have
invest
in
the
stock
why
don
t
we
think
about
do
it
recall
one
person
close
to
national
amusement
and
so
he
essentially
move
into
a
one
bedroom
room
at
the
carlyle
hotel
in
new
york
and
hunker
down
with
dauman
merrill
lynch

ken
miller
and
the
rest
of
his
adviser
for
round
the
clock
negotiation
with
banker
it
take
month
during
which
sumner
come
to
rely
ever
more
heavily
on
dauman
who
could
both
authoritatively
explain
concept
like
poison
pill
an
antitakeover
measure
that
viacom
s
board
have
adopt
that
would
dilute
share
if
any
investor
go
over
percent
and
happily
deliver
paper
to
his
hotel
room
in
the
middle
of
the
night
that
sumner
would
sign
in
his
bathrobe
on
christmas
morning
long
before
the
age
of
cell
phone
sumner
even
manage
to
track
dauman
down
at
his
in
law
house
despite
dauman
never
have
mention
his

s
maiden
name
to
sumner
convince
that
some
catastrophe
have
happen
with
the
deal
dauman
ran
to
the
phone
he
just
want
to
talk
dauman
recall
he
must
have
call
ten
or
eleven
people
to
find
out
where
i
be
on
february
sumner
offer
to
buy
viacom
for
a
share
an
offer
he
argue
that
be
not
just
high
than
the
management
s
offer
but
more
secure
viacom
s
management
s
reliance
on
junk
bond
would
almost
certainly
require
sell
off
and
cut
huge
piece
of
the
company
to
make
the
interest
payment
be
they
to
succeed
sumner
s
offer
would
be
fund
by
million
in
cash
and
viacom
stock
that
national
amusement
already
own
along
with
billion
in
bank
loan
nevertheless
viacom
s
board
reject
it
claim
it
be
worried
about
the
time
it
would
take
redstone
to
clear
regulatory
hurdle
sumner
want
to
go
high
but
he
need
more
information
about
the
inner
working
of
the
company
he
request
it
from
viacom
s
board
but
for
a
long
time
get
nothing
so
he
resort
to
other
method

by
now
bob
pittman
be
well
ensconce
in
his
new
office
in
rockefeller
plaza
where
he
be
sublet
space
from
his
former
boss
at
warner
communication
while
he
get
his
new
company
quantum
medium
back
by
mca
off
the
ground
he
have
left
on
reasonably
good
term
and
viacom
be
pitch
in
with
launch
a
record
label
for
the
new
company
but
in
truth
there
be
no
love
lose
between
pittman
and
the
viacomese
who
have
nickel
and
dim
him
on
his
way
out
the
door
sumner
ask
him
for
some
insight
into

too
happy
to
give
the
bostonian

call
freston
and
laybourne
argue
you
be
right
now
the
bastard
stepchild
of
viacom
but
if
you
help
sumner
and
he
get
the
company
you
be
go
to
be
the
crown

full
of
question
about
the

very
excite
about

to
do
with
the

want
to
know
if
they
would
leave
if
he
bought
the

and
fire
elkes
and
the
other
manager
who
be
behind
the
lbo
we
say
hell
no
recall
laybourne
we
would
see
it
as
a
chance
to
really
take
control
of
our
business
they
invite
him
to
come
see
their
office
which
be
locate
at
broadway
a
healthy
walk
north
from
viacom
s
headquarters
in
avenue
of
the
america
if
the
viacomese
found
out
they
d
be
fire
but
they
figure
they
could
slip
him
in
early
the
next
morning
he
show
up
in
the
lobby
with
a
rumple
sport
coat
mismatch
pant
a
checked
shirt
and
a
dab
of
shave
cream
on
his
ear
i
thought
look
he
s
like
an
old
man
freston
say
but
sumner
be
intoxicate
by
the
chaotic
scene
that
greet
him
music
blaring
kid
with
long
hair
quarter
inch
and
one
inch
tape
stack
everywhere
there
be
other
thing
too
that
he
like
about
viacom
but
it
be
mtv
network
that
really
sell
him
freston
say
he
thought
that
be
the
sexiest
part
he
return
to
his
war
room
in
the
carlyle
determine
to
win
the
company
he
raise
his
bid
several
more
time
and
management
match
it
each
time
sumner
near
the
limit
of
his
financing
capacity
take
a
deep
breath
and
ask
dauman
and
ken
miller
for
a
gut
check
should
he
really
risk
everything
by
go
high
he
turn
to
me
and
ken
and
say
i
m
not
go
to
do
the
deal
unless
you
say
yes
dauman
say
that
s
an
unusual
position
for
an
outside
lawyer
dauman
and
miller
agree
and
sumner
raise
the
bid
again
to
billion
this
time
he
add
a
redstonian
flourish
threaten
to
sue
viacom
s
board
of
director
to
be
frank
at
the
time
i
thought
it
be
a
questionable
tactic
recall
miller
you
finally
have
to
get
the
approval
of
the
people
you
be
sue
but
he
threaten
their
net
worth
and
that
turn
out
to
be
fairly
effective
in
a
clinch
dauman
though
concerned
be
more
open
to
the
maneuver
he
and
sumner
pen
the
subtly
but
definitively
threaten
letter
to
the
chairman
of
the
subcommittee
of
viacom
s
board
evaluate
the
bid
the
kicker
be
clear
enough
the
management
must
have
the
sense
that
it
need
not
have
the
best
offer
in
order
to
win
neither
we
nor
we
believe
the
shareholder
will
stand
for
such
a
result
watch
sumner
and
dauman
go
for
the
jugular
in
the
courtly
language
of
the
law

what
the

allow
its
channel
to
keep
their
quirky
authentic
voice
and
unshakable
connection
to

but
sumner
believe
that
other
division
of
viacom
especially
paramount
and
blockbuster
need
more
of
a
swashbuckling
murdoch

decide
he
want

in

where
we
both
own
one
so
we
could
get

benefit
of

what
if

or
actually
what
if
we

after
tell
the

so
loudly
that
he
do
not
want
one
disney
s
purchase
of
capital
city
abc
in
have
be
challenge
and
the
network
be
all
lose
audience
to
cable
but
karmazin
urge
him
to
look
past
the
network
to
the
tv
station
radio
station
the
big
group
of
them
in
the
country
outdoor
billboard

syndication
holding
and
to
see
the
total
package
as
an
advertising
behemoth
he
begin
to
turn
me
on
and
then
overnight
we
enter
into
very
serious
discussion
sumner
later
told
the
wall
street
journal
karmazin
return
to

for
another
meeting
a
few
day
later
this
time
with
double
d
dauman
and
dooley
who
urge
sumner
to
consider
the
merger
soon
the
negotiation
get
so
intense
that
they
have
to
be
move
from
viacom
s
headquarters
where
they
be
make
executive
like
freston
start
to
ask
question
to
karmazin
s
apartment
in
trump
tower
which
just
happen
to
be
the
former

on
a
rainy
tuesday

they
come
to
a

over

approve
it
on
another
rainy
tuesday
september
seventy
six
year
old
sumner
and
fifty
six
year
old
karmazin
stood
together
at
a
podium
and
announce
the
big
medium
merger
of
the
twentieth
century
viacom
would
acquire
cbs
corporation
for
billion
create
the
second
large
medium
company
after
time
warner
sumner
would
keep
control
with
a
majority
of
board
seat
on
the
merge
board
as
well
as
his
now
largely
ceremonial
ceo
title
but
karmazin
would
run
it
with
all
executive
reporting
to
him
under
the
title
of
president
and
chief
operating
officer
wall
street
love
the
deal
which
sent
both
stock
up
in
heavy
trading
strategically
a
deal
that
combine
viacom
s
program
asset
with
cbs
s
distribution
holding
struck
analyst
as
make
a
great
deal
of
sense
as
do
one
that
offer
advertiser
a
single
place
to
reach
all
stage
of
life
from
watcher
of
rugrats
to
fan
of
minute
everyone
else
be
bulking
up
from
disney
s
purchase
of
capital
city
abc
to
time
warner
s
purchase
of
turner
broadcasting
so
the
combination
have
a
sense
of
inevitability
there
be
also
a
certain
poetry
to
the
notion
that
viacom
cleave
off
from
cbs
in
the
s
with
an
uncertain
future
be
now
return
as
the
victorious
buyer
but
among
the
most
important
advantage
of
the
deal
for
many
viacom
watcher
be
that
it
finally
give
sumner
an
heir
apparent
as
part
of
the
deal
karmazin
want
dauman

dooley
go
they
be
sent
pack
with
golden
parachute
of
million
each
though
dauman

alive
half
of

would
go
into
a
section
of
the

for
phyllis

benefit
while
the

half
would

time
in

from
the

shari
have
a
more
prominent

this
tidy

have
the
benefit
of
spar
sumner
the
unpleasant
task
of
have
to
choose
between
freston

moonves
each
would
get
his
own

dubbed
the

viagrow

mapped
out
which

on
which

base
on
their
growth
rate
that
meant
that
simon

have
be

be
grow
at
the
modest
rate
of
a
mature
business
get
hand
over
to
moonves
ditto
showtime
this
decision
left
more
than
a

scratch
their
head
since
a
movie
fill
premium
cable
network
have
more
obvious
synergy
with

and
paramount
freston
get
paramount
s
film
studio
on
the
strength
of
his
pitch
that
he
would
make

intellectual
property
but
paramount
tv
go
to
moonves
moonves
put
a
positive
spin
on
the
situation
say
his
slow
grow
cash
rich
business
would
allow
him
to
pay
out
more
dividend
but
privately
he
fume
at
the
characterization
of
his
side
of
the
company
as
a
value
stock
sometimes
it
seem

that
there

himself
oust
freston
freston
get
up
calmly

the

sell
as
a
remedy
to
the
perception
that

lose
on
the
digital
front
we
have
to
be
more
plug
in
dauman
told

there
be
truth
to
the
criticism
mtv
still
claimed
eighty
two
million

online
the
four
million
monthly
unique
visitor
who
come
to
its

overdrive
video
site
be
a
fraction
of
the
fifty
five

stop
by
myspace
each

but
sumner
s
digital
beef
seem
more
personal
than
industrial
before

experience
sumner
suggest
that
dauman
and
dooley
s
time
as
private
equity
investor
give
them
important
insight
that
will
enable
us
to
well
navigate
the
digital
transition
and
prudently
capture
the
enormous
opportunity
that

clearly
out
there

up
cable
television

like
the

it
soon
become
clear
that
the
most
important
word
in
sumner
s
previous
phrase
be
prudently
he
have
no
intention
of
opening
his
wallet
for
a
transformational
digital
deal
i
would
not
consider
facebook
because
we
look
at
it
it
s
a
great
company
but
we
thought
the
price
be
too
high
he
told

not
long
afterward
we

about

they
fought
about
the
future
of
the
theater
business
most
people
chalked
it
up
to
two
passionate
personality
clash
i
never
take
any
of
the
fight
seriously
say
sherry
lansing
who
be
close
to
both
of
them
as
well
as
to
phyllis

next
week
shari
still
write
him
poem
on
his
birthday
and
sign
them
love
shari
but
by
late
the
strain
be
start
to
show
publicly
in
an
interview
with
recently
retire
disney
ceo
michael
eisner
in
october
sumner
be
candid
about
their
disagreement
on
the
theater
business
he
want
to
sell
the
theater
while
she
want
to
keep
expand
i
don
t
have
to
agree
with
her
because
she
s
my
daughter
he
say
it
s
not
a
growth
business
but
it
be
what
he
say
after
eisner
prod
him
on
why
he
wasn
t
planning
to
name
shari
ceo
of
national
amusement
that
everybody
remember
you
want
to
give
away
what
you
have
to
your
family
be
my
guest
i
be
still
very
active
i
work
very
hard
and
travel
around
the
world
for
viacom
i
m
not
about
to
give
up
control
my
wife
be
closer
to
me
these
day
than
my
daughter
the
studio
audience
laugh
like
he
be
joking
but
the
thing
that
truly
broke
their
relationship
be
midway
game
in
early
despite
his
promise
at
the
end
of
to
never
again
put
national
amusement
at
risk
with
his
midway
obsession
sumner
want
national
amusement
to
buy
more
of
his
midway
share
shari
vehemently
oppose
the
idea
but
she
be
outnumber
by
dauman
abrams
and
andelman
in
february
national
amusement
bought
another
million
share
from
sumner
for
roughly
million
bring
national
s
stake
to
percent
and
sumner
s
personal
stake
to
percent
shari
be
stun
that
these
men
savvy
lawyer
all
who
all
knew
perfectly
well
that
midway
be
a
dog
would
allow
this
madness
to
continue
the
moment
crystallize
for
her
the
impossibility
of
her
situation
so
long
as
these
men
be
on
the
board
of
national
amusement
her
percent
stake
would
always
be
meaningless
in
her
view
they
be
more
interested
in
suck
up
to
sumner
than
represent
the
fiduciary
interest
of
national
amusement
and
protect
her
family
s
legacy
the
break
over
midway
be
profound
enough
to
prompt
sumner
to
begin
maneuvering
to
undermine
her
right
to
succeed
him
as
chairman
unfortunately
i
have
come
to
believe
that
shari
do
not
have
the
requisite
business
judgment
to
serve
as
chairman
of
the
three
company
he
write
to
the
trustee
of
the
trust
on
february
because
congress
have
pass
the
sarbanes
oxley
act
tighten
regulation
on
public
company
accounting
since
the
trust
be
sign
in
he
argue
i
believe
it
may
not
be
wise
for
the
trustee
of
the
na
trust
to
impose
on
the
independent
director
of
cbs
and
viacom
the
obligation
to
have
shari
appoint
as
chairman
of
the
board
of
each
company
he
suggest
instead
that
the
board
should
have
the
discretion
to
independently
judge
whether
to
appoint
shari
as
chairman
in
the
letter
which
only
come
to
light
in
litigation
a
decade
later
he
also
seem
to
suggest
that
because
dauman
be
back
work
at
the
company
and
in
fact
be
ceo
he
no
longer
need
shari
as
a
successor
but
of
course
the
whole
reason
he
agree
to
make
shari
chairman
during
the
divorce
be
so
that
phyllis
could
have
assurance
that
someone
loyal
to
her
not
one
of
sumner
s
lackey
would
have
oversight
of
the
empire
after
sumner
die
shari
have
have
enough
she
want
out
she
hire
lawyer
and
negotiation
begin
on
her
possible
exit
from
the
empire
meanwhile
the
tension
spill
into
public
view
again
in
april
after
sumner
pledge
million
to
three
medical
institution
when
sumner
ask
that
national
amusement
pay
the
first
installment
of
his
pledge
shari
object
argue
that
national
amusement
not
sumner
should
then
get
credit
for
the
gift
again
dauman
abrams
and
andelman
side
with
sumner
andelman
told
the
boston
globe
that
the
gift
be
modest
and
highly
tax
advantage
and
in
the
best
interest
of
national
amusement
then
sumner
take
off
the
glove
on
july
sumner
sent
an
open
letter
to
forbes
lash
out
at
his
daughter
throw
her
talk
about
good
corporate
governance
back
in
her
face
while
my
daughter
talk
of
good
governance
she
apparently
ignores
the
cardinal
rule
of
good
governance
that
the
board
of
the
two
public
company
viacom
and
cbs
should
select
my
successor
he
say
he
would
allow
shari
to
be
bought
out
as
long
as
the
price
be
acceptable
and
end
with
a
vicious
kicker
it
must
be
remember
that
i
give
to
my
child
their
stock
and
it
be
i
with
little
or
no
contribution
on
their
part
who
built
these
great
medium
company
with
the
help
of
the
board
of
both
company
for
shari
who
have
spent
more
than
a
decade
run
the
theater
chain
try
to
balance
full
time
work
with
motherhood
take
the
delta
shuttle
down
to
new
york
for
viacom
board
meeting
and
then
back
in
time
for
dinner
only
to
return
again
the
next
morning
it
be
a
devastate
blow
it
be
also
revisionist
history
her
spokeswoman
shot
back
that
shari
have
receive
her
first
share
in
national
amusement
in
from
her
grandfather
mickey
and
suggest
that
the
chairman
title
be
not
her
aim
in
a
dig
meant
to
highlight
sumner
s
obsession
with
cling
to
the
ceo
title
she
add
anyone
who
know
shari
redstone
know
she
be
the
one
redstone
family
member
who
do
not
aspire
to
power
or
covet
title
but
she
do
say
that
shari
would
be
willing
to
consider
sell
her
percent
stake
of
her
father
s
empire
for
billion
use
the
same
valuation
that
brent
have
use
in
his
lawsuit
dauman
be
once
again
tapped
to
help
out
with
one
of
shari
s
divorce
only
this
time
he
represent
sumner
in

as
fortune
put
it
about
reduce
her
influence
in
the
affair
of
cbs
and
viacom
it
be
a
curious
role
for
him
to
be
play
as
the
chief
executive
of
viacom
but
people
who
know
the
family
say
he
be
always
sumner
s
fixer
first
they
discuss
sumner
buying
her
voting
stock
or
offering
her
the
theater
in
exchange
for
voting
stock
but
in
the
end
accord
to
her
spokeswoman
she
have
no
intention
of
leave
the
board
by
the
end
of
the
year
the
feud
appear
to
have
blown
over
when
sumner
name
shari
chairman
of
midway
game
i
fully
support
the
election
of

and
i
be
totally
confident
of
midway
s
success
sumner
say
in
a
statement
despite
the
stock
be
down
percent
for
the
year
in
fact
shari
s
ascension
to
the
chairmanship
of
midway
be
just
another
stop
on
its
downward
spiral
the
previous
chairman
ken
cron
have
left
in
frustration
after
sumner
refuse
a

offer
for
the
troubled
company
a
large
part
of
phyllis
s
divorce

have
be
in
midway

and
shari
felt
duty
bound
to
try
to
right
the
ship
but
sumner
didn
t
let
shari
run
midway
any
more
than
he
have

say
in

statement
the
day
after

that
there

without
commercial

into

a
lot

this
be
pretty
close
to
a

todd
juenger
an
analyst
at

c
bernstein
told
the
wall
street
journal
dauman
reject
this
narrative
argue
during
a
tense
earnings
call
that
netflix
could
not
be
blame
because
the
number
of
content
stream
that
netflix
report
to
viacom
be
pretty
much
the
same
in
both
the
fall
quarter
and
the
summer
before
the
rating
drop
he
chalked
up
the
drop
to
compete
show
on
the
disney
channel
and
a
glitch
in
nielsen
s
new
measurement
sample
but
when
rating
sank
percent
in
the
next
quarter
analyst
begin
ask
big
question
about
the
strategy
of
nickelodeon
and
viacom
in
general
spongebob
which
debut
in
and
be
the

account
for
percent

they
be
run
the

off
a
sure
thing
erode
its
value
without
invest
in
new
hit
to
replace
it
anticipate
this
criticism
dauman
emphasize
that
the
company
be
planning
more
spongebob
episode
as
part
of
a
push
to
make
five
hundred
episode
of
new
program
in
a
third
more
than
the
previous
year
but
the
investment
that
spoke
loud
be
the
buyback
the
company
say
it
spent
million
buying
back
its
own
stock
in
the
last
quarter
of
and
plan
to
continue
at
the
same
brisk
pace
in
early
at
the
time
of
this
announcement
the
stock
be
trading
at
around
a
share
theoretically
medium
company
ought
to
have
be
able
to
move
their
television
show
and
movie
onto
new
platform
like
laptop
ipads
cell
phone
and
roku
box
without
totally
blowing
up
their
business
model
after
all
the
new
place
to
watch
tv
only
increase
the
amount
of
tv
that
people
watch
but
during
these
crucial
early
year
when
the
country
s
broadband
and
wireless
infrastructure
be
finally
robust
enough
to
let
people
watch
live
television
anywhere
an
obtuse
standoff
between
channel
owner
like
viacom
and
their
distributor
like
comcast
ensure
that
the
lucrative
high
margin
pay
tv
business
that
fed
both
of
them
would
fall
to
the
barbarian
from
silicon
valley
the
pay
tv
industry
s
name
for
its
counterattack
be
the
optimistically
title
tv
everywhere
coin
during
an
early
experiment
between
time
warner
inc
and
comcast
in
this
early
version
time
warner
agree
to
give
the
digital
right
to
its
channel
like
cnn
tnt
and
cartoon
network
to
comcast
which
then
built
a
digital
player
for
its
subscriber
to
be
able
to
watch
the
channel
they
be
already
pay
for
on
their
digital
device
there
be
just
one
deeply
annoy
catch
the
subscriber
have
to
type
in
a
password
to
prove
they
be
current
on
their
comcast
bill
that
month
it
wasn
t
perfect
but
it
be
a
good
start
against
the
incursion
of
netflix
which
executive
like
time
warner
ceo
jeff
bewkes
argue
be
appeal
not
so
much
because
of
what
it
offer
it
be
still
at
this
stage
mostly
serve
the
warm
over
leftover
of
the
rest
of
the
medium
industry
but
how
it
offer
it
time
warner
s
vision
also
have
a
key
component
it
offer
these
digital
right
to
its
distribution
partner
free
of
charge
the
idea
be
to
encourage
the
comcasts
of
the
world
to
invest
in
the
technology
to
make
time
warner
s
channel
available
on
more
platform
but
the
nature
of
the
relation
between
television
programmer
and
distributor
be
that
nothing
get
do
unless
it
be
part
of
one
of
the
big
long
term
distribution
deal
they
negotiate
every
few
year
and
so
many
tv
programmer
eager
as
they
be
to
do
tv
everywhere
found
themselves
have
to
wait
many
year
until
their
deal
with
a
certain
distributor
be
ready
for
renewal
before
they
could
make
their
channel
work
on
ipads
or
roku
box
that
s
how
viacom
which
be
one
of
the
first
to
attempt
to
do
tv
everywhere
with
a
service
call
entitlement
on
time
warner
cable
back
in
end
up
be
one
of
the
last
medium
company
to
have
its
channel
function
on
digital
platform
and
while
they
didn
t
explicitly
charge
distributor
for
the
digital
right
to
their
channel
they
do
use
them
as
a
sweetener
for
overall
price
hike
far
slow
the
evolution
of
the
ecosystem
meanwhile
the
long
promise
advertising
business
on
distributor
video
on
demand
service
never
materialize
it
be
too
technically
difficult
to
swap
out
old
ad
for
more
current
one
and
simply
not
worth
the
effort
for
the
tiny
audience
that
watch
the
operator
just
sat
there
and
let
netflix
and
hulu
and
the
other
platform
take
away
the
digital
share
of
their
business
say
one
medium
company
executive
they
never
invest
in
the
infrastructure
that
would
make
pay
tv
as
please
to
use
as
netflix
because
they
didn
t
have
to
they
could
just
exit
the
tv
business
altogether
and
focus
instead
on
sell
broadband
use
tv
as
a
mere
glue
to
hold
together
bundle
of
telecom
service
rather
than
as
the
main
attraction
the
fact
that
program
cost
be
go
up
sharply
every
year
eat
into
distributor
margin
unless
they
raise
price
make
it
an
easy
strategic
decision
for
distributor
to
make
i
think
the
distributor
could
care
less
the
executive
say
they
be
thrive
on
their
broadband
business
their
tv
business
be
secondary
so
while
tv
everywhere
continued
its
glacially
slow
rollout
netflix
relentlessly
increase
its
market
share
to
a
majority
of
u
s
household
teach
a
whole
generation
to
expect
television
without
advertising
still
dauman
be
sanguine
about
it
often
joking
to
colleague
in
later
year
that
viacom
make
more
money
from
netflix
amazon
and
hulu
than
any
of
those
company
have
with
their
emphasis
on
growth
over
profit
viacom
stock
kept
go
up
and
earnings
per

the
ultimate
wall
street
report
card
go
up
even
faster
boost
by
the
company

constant
buyback
by
the
time
paramount
celebrate
its
centennial
in
the
summer
of
earnings
per

have
more
than
double
since
dauman
become
chief
executive
and
the
fixer
who
once
delighted
in
fly
under
the
radar
be
profile
in
the
new
york
time
in
a
piece
title
the
man
who
would
be
redstone
i
can
t
say
what
will
happen
after
i
m
go
which
will
be
never
sumner
told
the
time
but
everyone
understands
i
think
that
philippe
will
be
my
successor
behind
the
scene
though
dauman
and
shari
be
play
tug
of
war
two
week
after
the
time
story
sumner
give
an
interview
to
the
wall
street
journal
clarify
that
it
hasn
t
be
decide
yet
who
will
be
my
successor
and
philippe
know
it
he
know
shari
might
be
my
successor
and
it
s
not
a
competitive
race
between
them
we
have
to
see
what
happens
but
then
he
say
that
it
be
likely
that
dauman
would
inherit
the
chairman
role
at
viacom
and
moonves
would
inherit
it
at
cbs
there
be
reason
for
him
to
say
this
both
dauman
and
moonves
have
provision
in
their
contract
that
allow
them
to
walk
away
with
big
payouts
if
they
have
to
report
to
anyone
other
than
sumner
the
real
fight
however
be
not
over
the
board
of
cbs
and
viacom
but
over
the
trust
that
would
one
day
control
them
both
and
increasingly
shari
be
start
to
feel
like
she
would
have
to
one
day
sue
dauman
to
protect
her
family
s
empire
a
month
after
the
journal
story
she
write
her
father
a
draft
letter
to
complain
about
change
to
his
estate
planning
that
she
felt
disadvantage
her
and
she
sent
it
to
sydney
for
advice
this
be
nothing
more
than
a
calculate
move
by
philippe
to
oust
me
from
the
company
and
limit
my
role
go
forward
shari
write
her
father
have
grown
up
with
you
as
my
mentor
and
have
learn
from
watch
you
at
work
i
be
sure
you
understand
why
i
will
not
give
in
to
a
bully
and
then
to
sydney
she
write
in
the
meantime
every
email
my
father
sends
to
me
will
be
use
against
me
in
court
if
i
ever
have
to
take
philippe
on

by
early
as
sumner
head
toward
his
ninetieth
birthday
he
have
grown
weak
enough
to
need
overnight
nursing
care
and
sydney
be
exhaust
he
demand
her
constant
presence
if
she
step
into
another
room
or
go
out
to
run
an
errand
he
would
call
her
phone
over
and
over
keryn
redstone
once
joked
to
sydney
that
sumner
ought
to
just
go
ahead
and
get
her
a
shock
collar
so
agitate
do
he
become
when
she
be
not

of
sumner
that
worried
them
in
later
litigation
sumner
s
lawyer
would
characterize
the

as
concerned
whistle
blower
while
sydney
s
and
manuela
s
lawyer
would
paint
them
as
a
spy
ring
paid
by

eventually
go

get
a
peek
at
a
draft
of
the
question
and
answer
a
few
day
later
and
report
back
to
shari
that
they
be
not
favorable
to
her
they
say
that
the
only
family
member
who
visit
him
be
keryn
and
that
sumner
regret

he
also
report

sydney
write
note
for
sumner
to
read
to

over
the

about
the

dictate
a
sentence
to
him
i
kick
shari
out
of
the
house
that
he
repeat
over
and
over
again
prepare
to
tell
it
to
bishop
people
close
to
sydney
say
this
be
not
true
ultimately
however
bishop
do
not
think
that
response
to
the
magazine
criticize
shari
be
a
good
idea
on
april
a
lawyer
name
adam

who
have
work
with

at
loeb
loeb
and
have
recently
jumped
to
sheppard
mullin
where
he
begin
represent
sydney
and
manuela
sent
an
email
to
the
woman
recommend
that
sumner
refrain
from
antagonize
shari
in
his
email
interview
the
main
concern
by
viacom
leah
et
al
be
that
if
sumner
shame
shari
publicly
then
shari
will
seek
to
establish
a
conservatorship
over
sumner
he
write
if
she
do
that
then
his
current
condition
will
become
public
and
viacom
will
have
to
remove
sumner
as
an
officer
director
and
stop
pay
him
compensation
when
the
email
leak
a
year
later
shari
deny
have
ever
consider
conservatorship
of
her
father
but
the
email
stand
as
probably
the
single
most
damn
piece
of
evidence
that
the
people
around
sumner
include
dauman
tom
dooley
shari
and
andelman
who
be
all
on
the
board
of
the
public
company
that
sumner
control
likely
knew
that
sumner
be
unfit
to
serve
on
these
board
nearly
a
year
before
he
step
down
as
the

draw
executive
chairman
of
viacom
and
cbs
at
least
two
of
these
people
dauman
and
andelman
be
among
the
trustee
with
the
power
to
determine
whether
sumner
lack
the
capacity
to
remain
in
control
of
the
trust
that
held
all
national
amusement
share
accord
to
the
term
of
sumner
s
trust
sumner
could
be
deem
mentally
incapacitate
only
if
he
be
judged
incompetent
by
a
court
of
proper
jurisdiction
or
if
three
doctor
sent
the
trustee
certification
that
he
be
unable
to
manage
his
affair
in
a
competent
manner
and
yet
they
never
do
it
so
long
as
dauman
and
his
supporter
like
george
abrams
be
on
the
trust
shari
have
no
incentive
to
trigger
it
since
she
would
likely
be
outvote
in
exactly
the
same
way
she
have
be
on
the
midway
fiasco
and
so
long
as
sumner
kept
signing
off
on
ever
large
pay
package
for
dauman
he
have
no
incentive
to
take
action
either
in
the
next
couple
of
year
both
dauman
and
shari
would
file
lawsuit
allege
that
sumner
lack
mental
capacity
or
be
subject
to
manipulation
but
for
now
sumner
continued
to
pas
the
mental
capacity

that

the

dauman

himself
at

point
shari
have
be
so
distraught
over
dauman
s
performance
that
she
go

him
directly
and
say
they
both
knew
he
be
not
the

that

the

have

those
who

not
fall
into
this
category
have
little
leverage
unhappy
with
the
direction
of
the

conclude
there
be
little
he
could
do
about
it
under
the
current

bob

about

from

include
the

for

that
while
shari
have
not

clearly
name
as
her

she

full
throated
support
for

say
he
continue
to
have
my
unequivocal
support
and
trust
and
then
he
take
a
swipe
at
shari
with
echo
of
the
forbes
letter
say
that
the
transfer
of
what
i
create
my
control
interest
in

cbs
to
an

recent
speculation
about
personal
agenda
have
only
confirm
for
me
the
wisdom
of
my
decision
this
be
daumanese
for
back
off
shari
the
idea
that
sumner
could
have
write
or
even
dictate
this
statement
strain
credulity
but
viacom
s
leadership
have
close
rank
point
to
the
mental
capacity
test
that
he
have
recently
pass
when
he
write
sydney
out
of
his
will
the
journal
later
report
that
dauman
have
write
the
statement
heap
praise
on
himself
with
the
help
of
folta
though
there
have
be
some
edit
change
from
whom
it
wasn
t
entirely
clear
make
at
the
mansion
the
day
after
the
article
ran
dauman
go
to
visit
sumner
the
old
man
sat
in
his
upholstered
armchair
watch
baseball
on
mute
while
dauman
take
the
seat
to
his
left
and
manuela
take
the
seat
to
his
right
in
a
later
affidavit
dauman
claimed
that
sumner
be
engage
and
attentive
during
this
visit
we
have
an
extensive
business
discussion
regard
article
that
have
appear
recently
in
the
new
york
time
and
the
wall
street
journal
and
we
also
discuss
personal
matter
he
say
manuela
described
the
scene
differently
during
the
time
that
mr
dauman
be
in
the
room
sumner
look
at
him
only
a
few
time
most
of
the
time
sumner
be
gaze
somewhat
vacantly
toward
the
television
or
me
during
the
entirety
of
mr
dauman
s
visit
there
be
no
two
way
conversation
or
discussion
between
mr
dauman
and
sumner
none
whatsoever
it
be
a
monologue
by
mr
dauman
that
sumner
do
not
appear
to
comprehend
sumner
s
mental
state
during
this
apparently
inconsequential
meeting
would
turn
out
to
be
very
consequential
indeed
because
of
what
happen
next
exactly
how
manuela
herzer
come
to
be
eject
from
sumner
redstone
s
mansion
less
than
a
week
after
this
meeting
be
lose
in
a
fog
of
accusation
and
counteraccusations
but
a
few
thing
be
clear
the
first
be
that
sumner
do
not
handle
the
breakup
with
sydney
well
he
cry
all
the
time
and
be
more
fragile
and
vulnerable
than
at
any
point
in
his
long
life
the
second
be
that
manuela
be
not
beloved
by
the
household
staff
she
be
a
tough
demand
bos
on
a
good
day
and
in
the
tense
week
follow
sydney
s
departure
when
the
tabloid
be
begin
to
whisper
she
be

what
staff
call
a
reign
of
terror
on
the
people
work
in
the
house
the
third
be
that
this
terror
extend
into
her
want
to
keep
rival
out
of
the
house

when
an
analyst
ask
what
quality
the

have
see
in
him
and
his
performance
to
merit
his
new
role
dauman
reply
that
the
stock
drop
be
accentuate
by
a
lot
of
noise
that
s
surround
us
add
i
think
it
s
obvious
to
everybody
what
the
noise
be
if
dauman
be
go
to
survive
he
would
need
to
do
something
big
and
fast
in
the
last
year
he
have
make
several
smart
deal
include
the
purchase
of
the
british
broadcaster
channel
which
immediately
bolster
viacom
s
international
division
s
result
and

deal
with
snapchat
to
sell
advertising
against
the
vanish
message
app
company
s
own
and
operate
content
but
none
of
these
could
offset
the
effect
of
the
huge
rating
decline
and
distribution
woe
that
the
core
cable
channel
be
still
suffer
for
year
many
on
wall
street
have
grumble
that
viacom
ought
to
get
rid
of
paramount
which
be
financially
hardly
worth
the
headache
it
take
to
run
paramount
have
be
able
to
provide
some
surge
of
profit
at
key
moment
in
the
past
but
by
early
it
have
come
in
last
at
the
box
office
for
each
of
the
last
four
year
as
brad

pursue
a
cautious

in
hope
of

more
on

as

two

a

plan
make
some
sense
the
market
be
only
assign
paramount
a
value
of
about
billion
but
dauman
believe
that
the
mystique

year
old
hollywood
studio
along
with
its
vast
library
of
more
than
three
thousand

could
get
a
partner
to
value
it
at
closer
to
billion
particularly
if
that
partner
be
of
the
deep
pocket
starstruck
chinese
variety
like
dalian
wanda

which
have
just
paid
billion
for
legendary
entertainment
the
production
company
behind

that
wouldn
t
even
qualify
as
a
mini
major
studio
let
alone
a
major
indeed
by
mid
march
dauman
claimed
to
have
receive
interest
in
paramount
from
three
dozen
firm
include
some
asian
interest
it
would
later
emerge
that
wanda

by

with

for

to
do
a
similar
deal
with
alibaba

despite
his

klieger
be
young
and
dynamic
with
a
gen
x
cadence
to
his
speech
and
dark
eyebrow
that
make
him
look
a
bit
like
the
actor
bobby
cannavale
he
have
grown
up
in
pittsburgh
in
a
family
of
doctor
and
graduate
from
stanford
law
school
in
with
the
second
high
grade
point
average
in
his
class
thereafter
he
head
for
hollywood
where
he
represent
many
redstone
control
client
include
paramount
mtv
nickelodeon
and
showtime
along
the
way
he
also
dabble
in
the
creative
side
of
the
movie
business
cofounding
a
production
company
call
the
paradise
collective
and
land
executive
producer
credit
on
film
like
the
sci
fi
thriller
shortwave
in
the
promotional
shot
for
the
company
he
pose
with
a
movie
camera
in
his
hand
his
legal
brief
read
like
screenplay
with
tight
pace
colorful
scene
and
masterful
attention
to
character
development
his
arrival
signal
a
major
change
in
strategy
the
redstones
be
not
simply
go
to
fight
manuela
in
court
to
keep
her
away
from
sumner
they
be
go
to
fight
the
whole
machine
manuela
dauman
the
board
the
trust
all
of
it
to
put
shari
in
control
oust
dauman
and
stop
the
destruction
of
the
value
of
viacom
the
cornerstone
of
this
strategy
be
to
remove
dauman
as
sumner
s
health
care
agent
and
replace
him
with
shari
the
disagreement
over
the
paramount
stake
provide
the
perfect
illustration
of
how
sumner
and
dauman
s
long
friendship
have
deteriorate
sumner
have
become
very
disillusion
with
philippe
principally
not
because
of
viacom
s
shitty
performance
although
that
should
have
be
enough
but
principally
because
he
didn
t
listen
to
him
on
paramount
say
one
person
close
to
sumner
as
long
as
you
be
loyal
to
sumner
he
will
give
you
leeway
once
he
be
disloyal
to
sumner
sumner
no
longer
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
philippe
so
the
first
thing
he
want
be
to
get
philippe
off
his
health
care
agency
the
attorney
at
loeb
loeb
thought
this
be
a
highly
risky
maneuver
on
the
eve
of
trial
but
klieger
push
for
do
it
anyway
for
move
in
essence
from
defense
to
offense
as
judge
cowan
s
statement
on
shari
s
role
show
the
risk
for
her
be
far
great
not
to
be
sumner
s
health
care
agent
than
any
risk
of
complicate
the
trial
as
the
case
head
to
trial
both
shari
and
dauman
be
subpoenaed
to
be
depose
on
the
topic
of
sumner
s
mental
capacity
something
both
of
them
want
desperately
to
avoid
and
so
by
early
april
manuela
s
and
sumner
s
legal
team
have
enter
into
settlement
talk
which
shari
help
drive
a
deal
be
hammer
out
that
would
have
give
manuela
million
plus
the
carlyle
hotel
apartment
tax
free
and
most
crucially
in
the
midst
of
but
not
tie
to
this
settlement
deal
shari
be
make
sumner
s
health
care
agent
in
place
of
dauman
the
settlement
talk
fell
apart
in
part
because
manuela
come
back
with
a
series
of
demand
include
that
they
cover
her
legal
cost
if
she
be
sue
by
any
member
of
their
family
include
their
cousin
gary
snyder
snyder
who
also
live
in
beverly
hill
have
file
his
own
elder
abuse
complaint
on
sumner
s
behalf
against
manuela
in
march
drawn
from
the
detail
that
manuela
herself
have
include
in
her
initial
petition
to
be
reinstate
as
sumner
s
health
care
agent
the
redstones
also
refuse
to
agree
to
manuela
s
demand
that
they
fire
jagiello
and
tuanaki
who
she
believe
have
be
disloyal
to
her
but
most
of
all
she
want
to
see
sumner
one
last
time
and
for
her
and
her
child
to
be
at
his
funeral
even
if
she
be
enrich
by
her
relationship
to
sumner
she
truly
care
about
him
accord
to
people
who
know
her
the
redstones
be
not
have
it
even
after
the
talk
fell
apart
however
shari
kept
her
role
as
health
care
agent
shari
be
now
fully
in
control
she
told
the
court
how
her
father
s
health
flourish
since
she
and
her
child
have
be
able
to
visit
regularly
and
take
over
responsibility
for
his
medical
care

the
trial
on
may
be
a
full
blown
medium
circus
the
courtroom
in
los
angeles
superior
court
be
so
packed
with
reporter
that
official
be
check
to
make
sure
there
be
only
one
from
every
medium
outlet
inside
force
the
rest
to
crowd
in
the
hallway
around
a
tiny
grimy
window
where
they
could
just
make
out
powerpoint
slide
with
title
like
redstone
s
delusion
shari
be
there
in
a
gray
suit
with
her
son
brandon

casually
so

manuela
in
black
skirt
and
jacket
dark
stocking
and
black
clunky
heel
shari
shook
her
head
no
through
much
of
o
donnell
s
opening
statement
which
described
his
client
s
ouster
as
a
palace
coup
that
be
finance
by
his
daughter
shari
the
main
attraction
however
be
a
videotaped
deposition
of
sumner
aid
by
his
speech
therapist
which
be
played
for
a
close
courtroom
reporter
be
later
give
a
transcript
of
the
video
the
transcript
make
it
impossible
to
tell
exactly
how
well
or
authentically
sumner
could
form
word
and
where
his
own
word
end
and
the
interpreter
s
begin
in
the
course
of
the
deposition
sumner
try
and
fails
to
spell
out
word
with
a
pointer
and
cannot
answer
the
question
of
what
his
birth
name
be
but
the
transcript
have
him
answer
a
question
about
what
he
think
manuela
lie
to
him
about
with
the
phrase
about
terry
s
availability
and
sydney
s
letter
word
clearly
supply
by
the
interpreter
but
one
phrase
come
across
clearly
over
and
over
parrot
like
manuela
be
a
fuck
bitch
and
when
ask
whom
he
want
to
make
his
health
care
decision
he
stutter
but
go
on
to
say
shari
i
think
he
say
what
he
want
to
say
judge
cowan
say
after
watch
the
video
how
can
i
sit
here
and

after

that
video
no

follow
monday

clearly
express
that
he
didn
t
want
manuela
in
charge
of
his
health

but
the
judge
be
careful
to
note
that
this
do
not
mean

a
ruling

this

to
explore
what
recourse
they
would
have
if
they
be

off

the
answer
be
to
prove

incapacitate

manipulate
by
his

as
the

not

unlawfully
use
her

demonstrate
to
all
that

now
lack
the

as
soon

steadfastly
maintain
she
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
in
a
brilliantly
craft
pr

she

simply
i
fully
support
my

s
decision
and
respect
his
authority
to
make
them
indeed
in
the
week
after
the
trial
the
redstones
built
a
network
of
lawyer
and
pr
professional
around
sumner
that
put
shari
at
a
remove
from
any
of
the
statement
or
legal
filing
come
out
under
sumner
s
name
central
to
this
effort
be
rob
klieger
sumner
s
lawyer
the
creative
aggressive
litigator
who
have
won
the
case
against
manuela
shortly
after
join
the
legal
team
battling
manuela
in
march
klieger
have
become
a
trust
adviser
to
the
redstone
clan
he
be
as
one
of
them
put
it
engage
in
a
way
no
previous
lawyer
have
be
he
saw
the
big
picture
just
as
before
the
trial
it
be
his
idea
to
push
for
make
shari
sumner
s
health
care
agent
after
the
trial
it
be
his
idea
to
get
sumner
a
new
lawyer
a
corporate
counsel
that
sumner
would
use
to
go
to
war
against
the
men
who
have
be
his
most
trust
confidant
for
decade
part
of
the
reason
that
sumner
need
a
new
lawyer
be
that
paramount
be
clearly
go
to
loom
large
in
the
come
fight
and
klieger
be
conflict
as
he
be
still
work
for
paramount
on
other
matter
klieger
knew
paramount
be
about
to
spark
a
major
fight
because
before
the
trial
he
be
at
sumner
s
mansion
go
over
estate
planning
when
sumner
ask
him
to
please
communicate
to
viacom
that
he
do
not
want
to
pursue
the
paramount
sale
klieger
relayed
the
message
to
michael
fricklas
viacom
s
general
counsel
but
sumner
insist
he
go
high
up
the
chain
of
command
directly
to
the
board
so
klieger
relayed
the
message
to
two
board
member
george
abrams
and
fred
salerno
a
former
vice
chairman
of
verizon
who
have
be
on
viacom
s
board
since
verizon
s
predecessor
nynex
help
viacom
take
over
paramount
salerno
heard
klieger
out
but
say
that
he
would
need
to
verify
what
he
be
say
with
sumner
directly
since
he
didn
t
know
klieger
and
wasn
t
even
sure
that
klieger
really
represent
sumner
salerno
would
try
many
time
to
visit
sumner
both
before
and
after
the
trial
to
no
avail
abrams
call
back
a
few
week
later
tell
klieger
that
he
be
no
longer
sure
that
what
sumner
say
he
want
be
really
what
he
want
i
m
go
to
be
approach
this
from
the
view
of
what
i
think
sumner
would
want
abrams
told
klieger
after
so
many
legal
maneuver
claim
and
counterclaim
not
to
mention
a
rotate
cast
of
lawyer
ply
their
ware
it
be
hard
to
know
who
or
what
to
believe
at
this
point
it
be
no
surprise
then
that
neither
viacom
s
management
nor
its
board
do
anything
when
they
receive
these
message
and
that
lack
of
action
provide
all
the
reason
that
sumner
would
need
to
get
rid
of
them
the
day
after
the
trial
klieger
flew
to
hawaii
on
a
preplanned
vacation
but
spent
most
of
his
time
there
on
the
phone
try
to
rustle
up
an
unconflicted
corporate
counsel
for
sumner
through
a
referral
he
found
his
way
to
michael
tu
leader
of
the
shareholder
litigation
practice
at
orrick
herrington
sutcliffe
one
of
the
very
few
los
angeles
firm
that
do
not
have
some
business
somewhere
with
cbs
or
viacom
and
be
not
daunt
by
the
prospect
of
go
up
against
the
chief
executive
of
one
of
the
world
s
large
medium
company
through
another
referral
from
shari
s
spokeswoman
nancy
sterling
he
found
a
spokesman
for
sumner
the
boston
base
michael
lawrence
tu
and
lawrence
then
set
about
attack
dauman
and
abrams
on
behalf
of
sumner
largely
on
the
ground
that
they
be
proceed
with
the
sale
of
a
paramount
stake
against
his
wish
viacom
counter
that
they
didn
t
speak
for
sumner
who
have
dial
into
a
board
meeting
a
few
day
earlier
without
voice
any
objection
to
the
paramount
stake
sale
in
truth
both
side
have
their
work
cut
out
for
them
in
challenge
sumner
s
mental
capacity
dauman
be
now
in
the
awkward
position
of
argue
the
opposite
of
what
he
have
just
argue
in
manuela
s
litigation
when
he
have
submit
that
affidavit
call
sumner
engage
and
attentive
like
manuela
he
have
to
thread
the
very
fine
needle
of
argue
that
sumner
have
have
capacity
very
recently
in
this
case
as
recently
as
february
when
he
have
vote
to
tap
him
to
succeed
him
as
chairman
of
viacom
and
then
suddenly
lose
it
dauman
s
legal
challenge
be
compound
by
viacom
s
continue
abysmal
performance
which
make
any
move
toward
remove
him
as
ceo
however
indirect
appear
logical
in
the
best
interest
of
shareholder
and
very
much
in
keep
with
sumner
s
history
of
behavior
toward
previous
ceo
but
the
challenge
and
risk
for
shari
be
even
great
like
dauman
she
too
suddenly
found
herself
on
the
opposite
side
of
her
previously
held
argument
about
her
father
s
mental
capacity
after
spending
two
year
so
convince
that
sydney
and
manuela
be
take
advantage
of
her
enfeeble
father
that
she
have
pledge
to
sue
them
for
undue
influence
she
be
now
argue
that
he
have
the
mental
capacity
to
make
massive
change
to
his
long
held
estate
planning
before
the
year
be
out
the
woman
s
long
held
fear
that
their
inheritance
and
gift
would
be
challenged
prove
well
found
and
sumner
would
sue
manuela
and
sydney
for
elder
abuse
and
undue
influence
in
a
suit
the
woman
claimed
shari
be
behind
this
view
essentially
put
her
at
odds
with
the
viacom
board
which
have
recoil
in
horror
at
what
sumner
s
testimony
at
manuela
s
trial
have
reveal
about
his
mental
state
and
promptly
vote
to
cut
his
pay
out
of
well
found
fear
that
they
be
vulnerable
to
shareholder
lawsuit
if
they
do
otherwise
you
have
to
ask
what
you
should
be
pay
him
if
anything
say
one
person
familiar
with
the
board
s
think
you
question
whether
he
have
the
mental
capacity
to
be
a
decision
maker
on
the
board
people
close
to
sumner
point
to
his
anger
over
his
pay
cut
as
another
reason
he
be
ready
to
ax
dauman
and
abrams
when
their
replacement
be
formally
announce
a
few
day
later
along
with
the
appointment
of
shari
s
daughter
kim
to
the
national
amusement
board
sumner
s
statement
have
an
old
testament
quality
this
be
my
trust
and
my
decision
he
say
i
have
picked
those
who
be
loyal
to
me
and
remove
those
who
be
not
if
you
listen
hard
enough
you
could
almost
hear
the
theme
from
the
godfather
play
in
the
background

fred
salerno
knew
this
movie
be
unlikely
to
end
well
for
him
just
a
week
before
the
telecommunication
veteran
have
be
name
to
the
newly
create
position
of
lead
independent
director
a
role
he
have
played
on
other
public
company
board
in
a
last
ditch
effort
to
quell
the
critic
of
viacom
s
corporate
governance
but
as
soon
as
the
redstones
make
their
move
against
dauman
salerno
cast
his
lot
with
the
beleaguer
ceo
with
whom
he
have
serve
on
viacom
s
board
for
nearly
three
decade
we
believe
that
philippe
and
the
entire
management
team
have
a
strong
and
smart
plan
to
move
forward
and

we
support

have
be

game
with
sumner
s

try
in

to
get
an
audience
with

so
that
he

for
himself
whether

in
his

before
the

the

nixed
any

after

klieger

any

have
to

he
then
take
up
the

say
any
meeting
would
need
to
be
consider
carefully
give
salerno
s
comment
to
the
press
about
sumner
and
shari
and
ask
salerno
to
submit
an
agenda
of
the
propose

sarcastically
follow
order
say
the

would
open
with

about
our

over
decade
together
as

anything
else
sumner
would
like
to
share
with
us
and
finally
good
bye
but
he
knew
that
it
be
just
a
matter
of
time
before
he
and
much
of
the

of

be

they
laid

to

in

where

be
incorporate
we
know
that
such
an
attempt
on

would
be
completely
inconsistent
with
sumner
s
lifetime
commitment
to
an
independent
board
and
professional
management
for

after

in
an
open
letter
on
may
respond
to
speculation
about
his
imminent
ouster
more
specifically
it
would
be
equally
inconsistent
with
his
state
judgment
for
many
year
that
his
daughter
shari
should
not
control
viacom
or
his
other
company
it
would
be
easy
to
just
leave
he
say
but
to
a
person
the
board
felt
morally
bound
to
fight
because
of
the
inexplicable
assertion
that
sumner
be
act
of
his
own
free
will
while
simultaneously
dodge
a
face

unhappy
with

viacom
s

prove
to

the

that

they
be
also
rather
incredibly
argue
that
it
didn
t
matter
whether
he

or
not
a
few
day
before
the

abrams
off
the

make
the

valid
regardless
of
whether

this
meant
that
david

long
in
lockstep
with
dauman
and
abrams
against
shari
when
sumner
be
well
have
side
with
shari
now
that
sumner
be
sick
several
people
familiar
with
the
matter
say
that
andelman
s
signing
off
on
so
much
of
the
money
that
the
woman
receive
from
sumner
left
him
vulnerable
david
be
not
a
super
wealthy
guy
one
of
them
say
he
bill
the
redstones
over
the
year
but
he
couldn
t
withstand
a
redstone
lawsuit
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
make
the
pragmatic
decision
i
m
go
to
go
with
shari
he
be
always
the
weak
link
that
be
basically
checkmate
once
she
have
david
andelman
denies
this
be
his
motivation
shari
never
threaten
me
with
litigation
over
my
role
in
sumner
s
give
money
to
the
woman
and
i
do
not
flip
to
her
side
but
continued
to
represent
sumner
and
act
in
his
best
interest
he
say
the

that
dauman

literally
cannot
win

close

defuse

in
a

way
without

start
up

tyler

serve
alongside

the

exceedingly
polite
manhattanite
lawyer

a
nerdish
delight
in
the
intricacy
of
business
transaction
law
tyler
felt
sure
that
dauman
be
both
pragmatic
and
risk
averse
be
a
reasonable
enough
person
to
come
to
the
negotiate
table
and
find
a
way
to
a
peaceful
exit
he
be
right
soon
after
tyler
and
his
lawyer
david
sloan
of
holland
knight
and
dauman
and
his

bob

sat
down
in
a
conference

kick
off
what
would
end
up
be
nearly
two
month
of
settlement
talk
tyler
felt
that
the
key
be
to
give
dauman
some
kind
of
capstone
for
his
long
career
for
the
veteran
merger
and
acquisition
lawyer
ideally
a
transaction
that
would
allow
him
to
leave
with
dignity
in
early
talk
tyler
even
float
the
idea
of
merge
viacom
and
cbs
which
the
national
amusement
board
have
be
mull
for
three
year
but
it
become
clear
that
the
transaction
that
dauman
felt
be
most
necessary
to
stabilize
viacom
be
to
find
a
joint
venture
partner
for
paramount
and
so
the
outline
of
the
deal
come
together
quickly
dauman
would
step
down
after
get
a
chance
to
pitch
the
benefit
of
the
paramount
deal
to
the

immediately

dauman

in
an

the

by
a
thread
shari
load
sumner

he
felt

but
when
news
of
the

to
reuters
national
amusement
be
quick
to
reject
the
idea
apparently
regardless
of
the
price
argue
that
such
a
deal
would
limit
viacom
s
ability
to
take

other
partner
and
chill
the

of

that

involve
all
of

expect
that
the
first
of

with

which
many

push
for

earlier
in

the

with
the

it
go
over
like
a
lead
balloon
salerno
and
his
fellow

be
livid
that

their
back
and
even
less
pleased
that
the

have
a
soft
land
for
himself
but
an
abrupt
departure
for
his
fellow

i
think
they
be
very
upset
with
what
philippe

say
one
person
familiar
with
the

they

not

it

what

the

then
go

not

the

she
felt
have
preyed
on
him
shari

that

back
she
want
nothing
more
than
for

forever
she

meanwhile
allege
that

behind
the

they
note
that
the

at
a
time
when
sumner
could
not
even
talk
let
alone
hire
counsel
for
complex
litigation
it
be
a
highly
risky
maneuver
for
someone

have
just
pull
off
an
astonishingly
successful

by
argue
that

so
susceptible

that
the

be
able
to
drain
his

account
without
his
true

klieger
be
step
dangerously
close
to
undermine
the
argument
for

s
current
mental
capacity
upon
which
many
of
the
decision
from
the
last
year
and
indeed
shari
s
rise
to
power
rest
though
in
this
context
klieger
s
argument
that
it
didn
t
matter
whether
sumner
have
capacity
or
not
since
shari
have
the
vote
take
on
great
meaning
it
also
raise
the
question
of
why
shari
as
a
member
of
viacom
and
cbs
s
board
do
not
voice
her
concern

if

who
felt
that

nothing

incredible
she
told
the

note
that
she

the
first
woman
as

bring
with
her
all
the
supposedly

decidedly
un

quality
of

they
have
good

there

the
work
that
i
do
at
advancit
as

her
most

be
to

the
nightmare
of
the
last
year
do
not
play
itself
out
again
in
thirty
year
and
so
in
the
midst
of
all
the
fight

in

the

banking

to

and
the

to
pull
the

out
of
its
slump
such
be
the
plan
of
a
man
with
very
little
room
to
maneuver
when
bakish
first
step
into
the
corner
office
he
found
a
company
so
lever
that
its
debt
be
teeter
on
junk
territory
paramount
have
just
finish
lose
half
a

the

at
iconic

like
mtv
hadn
t
grown
in
five
year
with
such
weak
rating
the
company
be
no
longer
in
a
position
to
play
the
bully
with
its
distributor
who
loathe
the
way
viacom
have
force
them
for
year
to
take
dozen
of
channel
they
mostly
didn
t
want
just
so
they
could
have
spongebob
and
the
daily
show
some
analyst
assume
it
be
only
a
matter
of
time
before
a
major

drop
viacom
altogether
nearly
as

wasn
t

such
as
hulu

s
solution
be
to
get
real
the
future
have
no
space
for
viacom
s
two
dozen
channel
and
so
in

in
addition
to
get

to
improve

and
global
distribution
each
of
these
would
also
have
paramount
make
movie
out
of
their
best
intellectual
property
other
channel
weren
t
necessarily
kill
outright
but
many
of
the
weak
would
likely
shrivel
up
and
die
he
overhaul
the
leadership
of
the
six

channel
personally
recruit

he
paid
down

quietly
say

not

during

in

wooed

whose
early
decision
to

all

it

bottom
out
at
a

from

suggest
be
possible
when
they
have
go
a
year
earlier
to

kept
the
channel
on
enough
people
s

prop
up
the

it
meant
that

to
accept
a
reduction
in

to
distributor
essentially
shift
the
engine
that
have
driven
the

for

into
idle
and
unlike
in
dauman

bakish

viacom
could
not
patch
up

in

revenue
with

from

bakish
have
make

that
they

by
the

calamity
graham

to
create
the
opportunity

ultimately
lead

graham
write

that
her

thought
of
her

paramount
people
who
know

to
the
moment
that

inform
her

only
to
hear
him
bemoan
the
loss
of
his

for
whom
business
be
the
most
vivid
thing
in

some
describe
shari
s
involvement
in
the
business
as
motivate
entirely
by
family
dynamic
it
be
the
only
way
that
she
could
actually
become
a
person
in
her
father
s
eye
the
irony
be
that
shari
s
professional
ascent
could
only
come
about
by
battling
her
own
father
who
obstinately
refuse

he
didn

want
her
in

he
didn

when
she
be
there
he
cave
say
one
person
close
to
the
family
any
power
that
he
do
give
her
she
have
to
wrest
from
him
as
he
have
wrest
it
from
others
and
yet
once
shari
make
her
way
into
the
boardroom
of
her
family
s
business
she
be
force
to
reckon
with
some
of
the
same
dynamic
katharine
graham
experienced
a
generation
before
both
be
belittle
talk
over
and
snicker
at
behind
close

in
shari

case
often
by
her
own
father
even
well
into
the
twenty
first

a
female

so
devoid

not

in

google

account

try
to
cook
up
some
kind
of

would
he
have
have
the

upend
his

planning
document
which
go

to
preserve
the

he
built
for

he
may
still
have
the
chance
these

you
the

technically
decide
the
