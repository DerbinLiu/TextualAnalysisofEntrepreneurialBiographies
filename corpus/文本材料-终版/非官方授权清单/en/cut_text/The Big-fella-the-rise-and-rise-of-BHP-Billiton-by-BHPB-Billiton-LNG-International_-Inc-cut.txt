it
be

have
his
historic
meeting
with

blacken
stump
of
a

shun
by

prospector
as
a
heap
of

by
then
there
be
another
factor
at
play
in
rasp
s
quest
beyond
the
usual
ambition
among

for
untold
rich
if
as
he
fervently
hop
he
have
discover
a

of

it
would
provide
the
shin
key
to
unlock
the
heart
of

to

a
regular
group
of
professional
men
gather
there
and
though
rasp
camped
on
the
bank
of
the
torrens
in
the
early
day
he
be
welcome
into
their
company
he
reciprocate
warmly
but
in
truth
it
be
agnes
who
drew
him
back
to
that
sensual
snuggery
with
its
delicious
aroma
sparkle
surface
and
genial
conversation
and
while
she
be
welcome
even
encourage
she
left
him
in
no
doubt
she
would
never
give
her
hand
to
a
penniless
boundary
rider
of
the

so
when
he
arrive
at
the

sinker
camp
with
his
tin
sample
he
be
not
just
argue
for

partnership
but
for
his
heart

nothing

divert
him

fortunately

later
admit
i

no
idea
of

i
be
as
green
as
could
be
but
such
be
the
certainty
in
his
demeanour
that
by

that

he
have
persuade
them

frustratingly
it

that

in

the

one
steelmaker
in
particular
david
baker
of
philadelphia
seem
to
bring
the
kind
of
clear
sight
approach
to
the
issue
that
mirror
his
own
he
recommend
that
the
board
engage
baker
to
conduct
an
urgent
feasibility
study
into
the
development
of
an
australian
steel
industry
lead
by
bhp
darling
secure
board
approval
and
baker
sail
for
australia
with
his
daughter
when
delprat
return
he
submit
his
report
in
a
seven
page
letter
address
to
the
chairman
the
fact
of
the
company
hold
an
immense
iron
ore
deposit
in
south
australia
make
it
incumbent
on
us
to
find
out
if
this
iron
ore
could
be
turn
into
more
profitable
use
than
by
merely
use
it
as
a
flux
in
the
smelter
at
port
pirie
the
demand
for
steel
in
australia
have
grown
steadily
and
today
the
requirement
be
such
that
the
urgent
necessity
of
have
steel
work
in
the
commonwealth
be
a
well
recognise
fact
very
careful
examination
and
boring
of
iron
knob
have
convince
me
that
here
we
have
a
solid
basis
for
an
iron
and
steel
industry
which
will
be
sufficient
for
more
than
a
generation
and
i
have
far
convince
myself
that
the
quality
of
the
ore
be
the
very
best
that
can
be
have
for
make
steel
he
then
identify
the
newcastle
and
wollongong
area
as
source
for
excellent
coke
coal
and
after
range
over
relative
production
cost
the
availability
of
skilled
labour
the
best
site
hummock
hill
the
type
of
blast
furnace
and
his
consultation
with
state
and
federal
minister
delprat
conclude
i
be
of
opinion
sic
that
it
be
of
great
importance
that
the
work
should
be
start
without
loss
of
time
the
great
need
for
iron
and
steel
work
in
australia
be
be
realise
by
other
men
and
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
it
be
a
very
great
advantage
to
be
first
in
the
field
should
the
board
decide
to
proceed
i
would
suggest
all
possible
despatch
his
report
be
follow
almost
immediately
by
a
more
detailed
analysis
from
david
baker
in
which
he
back
the
move
with
figure
show
big
potential
profit
however
he
disagreed
with
delprat
s
choice
of
hummock
hill
as
the
site
of
the
steelworks
nearly
three
quarter
of
a
ton
of
coal
be
require
above
the
weight
of
ore
necessary
to
make
a
ton
of
steel
rail
and
as
the
freight
on
a
ton
of
coal
deliver
to
a
point
near
the
ore
say
hummocky
sic
hill
be
the
extra
cost
for
coal
in
make
steel
at
that
point
be
d
or
in
addition
there
be
great
scarcity
of
fresh
water
at
hummocky
hill
and
as
the
harbour
at
port
kembla
near
wollongong
be
too
small
and
poorly
protect
to
consider
my
recommendation
be
to
build
the
blast
furnace
and
steel
work
on
property
have
a
water
front
in
the
harbour
at
newcastle
nsw
a
week
later
delprat
respond
in
a
remarkable
letter
to
darling
i
thoroughly
discuss
this
point
with
mr
baker
and
find
that
he
be
right
and
that
i
be
wrong
newcastle
be
certainly
the
best
site
we
can
take
he
then
recommend
that
the
company
engage
baker
to
build
the
work
as
superintendent
on
a
five
year
contract
at
an
annual
salary
it
will
take
two
and
a
half
to
three
year
to
properly
construct
the
plant
he
say
and
two
year
more
be
not
too
much
to
enable
mr
baker
to
prove
that
the
plant
will
fulfil
his
promise
darling
agree
and
baker
set
up
his
construction
headquarters
in
newcastle
again
bhp
have
chosen
well
baker
be
a
tall

before
establish
himself
as
a
consult
engineer
he
be
immediately
infatuate
with
australia
and
enthuse
by
the
opportunity
to
establish
a
national
steel
industry
virtually
from
scratch
australia
s
appetite
for
steel
have
reach
a
million
ton
annually
most
of
which
be
be
import
the
only
local
competitor
be
the
lithgow
work
of
charles
hoskins
who
have
take
over
a
company
with
a
troubled
history
begin
with
an
attempt
by
the
british
industrialist
john
lysaght
to
start
a
wire
net
work
in
its
location
so
far
from
the
coast
meant
it
could
never
compete
on
equal
term
with
bhp
however
hoskins
do
have
plan
to
move
some
of
his
operation
to
port
kembla
baker
didn
t
give
a
fig
for
the
competition
his
only
concern
be
to
bring
his
steelworks
in

time
and
on
budget
in
three
year
at

there
will
be
an
explosion
indeed
from
his
subsequent
action
it
be
clear
that
lewis
well
ahead
of
his
contemporary
saw
japan
as
a
rise
military
threat
to
australia
as
soon
as
he
left
the
country
he
sketch
out
plan
to
fight
back
against
possible
invasion
bhp
should
immediately
retool
for
the
manufacture
of
munition
and
it
should
begin
to
build
up
massive
stock
of
raw
material
it
should
plan
to
build
warship
minelayer
torpedo
boat
and
small
destroyer
at
newcastle
and
whyalla
and
make
a
start
on
an
aircraft
industry
the
japanese
be
arm
to
the
teeth
he
say
and
i
be
inform
that
in
emergency
they
could
build
fighter
plane
a
day
in
a
meeting
with
darling
and
w
s
robinson
the
early
pioneer
of
broken
hill
mining
company
now
head
an
international
mining
conglomerate
he
secure
agreement
for
a
syndicate
that
would
soon
become
the
commonwealth
aircraft
corporation
its
plant
at
victoria
s
fisherman
s
bend
would
in
time
produce
the
australian
design
wirraway
aircraft
but
when
he
take
his
concern
to
the
political
arena
he
be
initially
regard
as
an
alarmist
whatever
japan
s
intention
he
be
told
australia
be
safe
behind
the
impregnable
fortress
of
singapore
so
he
visit
singapore
in
he
be
not
convince
for
one
thing
singapore
have
no
battle
fleet
of
its
own
behind
the
scene
he
continued
to
urge
preparation
for
war
nevertheless
he
authorise
the
sale
of
bhp
iron
ore
and
pig
iron
the
raw
product
of
newcastle
s
blast
furnace
to
both
germany
and
japan
reason
that
he
be
funding
an
australian
steel
industry
that
provide
the
bulwark
against
military
aggression
it
be
a
self
serve
argument
and
it
become
untenable
in
when
the
japanese
secure
the
west
australian
government
s
approval
to
ship
one
million
ton
of
iron

from

protest
erupt
and
the
federal

quickly
respond
prime

himself
met
with
lewis
to
warn
him
that
his
government
be
about
to
ban
all
iron
ore
export
they
would
give
a
diplomatic
reason
that
australia
have
barely
enough
for
its
own
need
lewis
accepted
the
decision
without
public
demur
in
return
lyon
agree
that
bhp
would
continue
to
export
pig
iron
to
japan
from
the
newcastle
plant
the
result
be
a
political
time
bomb
the
port
kembla
wharfies
lit
the
fuse
when
they
refuse

on

that
it
would
be

when

in
the
event
the
unionist
give
ground

but
menzies
reputation
would
be
forever
tarnished
with

meanwhile
the

have
the
same
access
to
the
war
cabinet
as
the
military
chief
of
staff
and
though
it
be
not

formally
he
would
have
unimpeded
access
to
the
prime
minister
lewis
who
abhor
publicity
of
all
kind
be
not
on

to
hear
the
announcement
he
have

by
now
he

for
the
next
four
year
aside
from
wednesday
afternoon
tennis
in
his

he
would

redoubt
he
establish
headquarters
at
western

but
spent
most
of
his
wake
hour
travel
to
inspect
munition
facility
or
meeting
with
his
board
of
fellow
industrialist
by
common
consent
he
do
a
remarkable
job
at
its
height
lewis

they
channel
more
than

without
a

accusation

however

and
employ

in

undying
hatred
labor
leader
john
curtin
and
his
deputy
frank
forde
also
spoke
in
favour
of
nationalise

but
when
the
menzies
government
fell
in
and
labor
take
the
treasury
bench
their
attitude
change
almost
overnight
one
reason
be
the
return
to
parliament
of
ben
chifley
who
have
lose
his
seat
in
and
have
be
a
key
figure
in
lewis
s
directorate
of
munition
as
director
of
labour
he
be
unstinting
in
his
praise
of
the
bhp
chief
indeed
by
mid
prime
minister
curtin
be
so
impressed
with
lewis
s
work
that
he
offer
him
a
knighthood
despite
the
fact
that
such
imperial
honour
be
against
labor
policy
lewis
decline
but
when
curtin
persist
he
accepted
the
order
of
companion
of
honour
an
award
usually
reserve
for
dominion
prime

by
then
with

threaten
australia

unionist

have
put
aside
their
grievance
and
a
new

of
common
purpose
be
sweep
the
nation
unfortunately
it
didn
t
last
beyond
the
immediate
crisis
and
embarrassingly
for
lewis
one
of
the
most
troubled
area
be
the
bhp
newcastle
plant
in
december
a
demarcation
dispute
between
worker
and
executive
over
who
would
run
various
element
of
the

lead
to
a
company
lockout
and
at
port
kembla
there
be
a
series
of
stoppage
until
curtin
himself
step
in
and
oversaw
a
conciliation
agreement
by
mid
most
of
lewis
s
war
work
be
do
he
have
greatly
expand

s
coastal
shipping

to

use
bhp

to

the

smoothly
and
the
american

at
the

time
it
enjoy
a
massive
expansion
particularly
of
steelmaking
in

now
he
undertook
a

tour
to
discover
the

officially
relinquish

whatever

you
might

expect
to

leisure
be
never

he
return
to

melbourne
the

after
his

hopeful
that

the

mclennan
convince

he
call
mclennan
into
his
collins

well
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
about
it
mac
lewis
say
well
i
think
either
norman
jones
or
i
have
well
go
up
there
and
spend
a
bit
of
time
he
reply
that
s
exactly
what
i
think
and
it
have
well
be
you
there
be
a
second
string
to
the
bow
mclennan
also
take
over
as
general
manager
of

s
recently
acquire
australian
iron

partially
locate
at

kembla
i
still
have
my
job
as
assistant
general
manager
in
melbourne
he
say
but
i
be
general
manager
of
port
kembla
as
well
and
the
intention
be
that
i
might
do
that
for
a
couple
of
year
but
in
january
mr
harold
darling
die
so
that
upset
the
applecart
mr
essington
lewis
become
chairman
of
the

norman
jones
become
manage
director
and
i
become
general
manager
of
the
whole
company
this
meant
i
couldn
t
spend
the
amount
of
time
i
have
be
spending
at
port
kembla
however
during
his
period
in
wollongong
he
forge
yet
another
link
between
bhp
and
the
government
when
nominate
by

chifley
to
the
immigration
planning
council
the
massive
immigration
scheme
initiate
at
the

would
help
to
solve
the
major
impediment
to
the

s
and
the
nation
s
growth
the
first

be
by
the
end
of
new
australian
make
up
per
cent
of
the

perhaps
unsurprisingly
the
new
menzies
government
establish
three
big
migrant
hostel
around
port
kembla
to
accommodate
them
the
new
south
wale
state

follow
up
with
large
number
of

commission
home
mclennan
would
remain
the
guide
light
of
the

for
the
next
year
as
the
cold

deepen

the

a
major
threat
to

mclennan
cross
another
barrier
between

in

he
join

the

its
deliberation
be

highly
secret
once

never

in
the
year
ahead
bhp
operative
would
boast
of
their
access
to

source
within

the
benefit
to
their
international
negotiation
would
be
incalculable
the
s
be
a
decade
of
uninterrupted

and
in
prime
minister
menzies
officially
open
the
hot

mill
declare
it
a
great
historic
event
that
make
possible
the
success
of
hundred
of
additional
industry
far
down
the
line
it
be
no
exaggeration
the
new
plant
increase
steel
processing
capacity
by
nearly
a
million

and
eventually

represent

from
until
his

in
a
lean
autocratic
figure
who
privately
suffer
an
agonise
dermatitis
all
his
adult
life
mcewen
not
only
continued
menzies
close
association
with
bhp
but
as
deputy
prime

he
become
the
champion
of
protection
for
secondary
industry
as
bhp
expand
its
steel
output
each
year
mclennan
become
increasingly
aware
of
the
need
to
secure
new
source
of
raw
material
particularly
iron
ore
i
have
a
major
amount
to
do
with
get
the
exploration
program
go
mclennan
say
we
could
see
iron
monarch
and
nearby
iron
baron
be
work
out
so
i
put
a
lot
of
personal
effort
into
try
to
find
new
deposit
the
company
recruit
no
few
than
geologist
and
set
them
search
across
the
continent
for
the
most
economic
ore
body
after
a
false
start
in
queensland
s
constance
range
they
turn
their
attention
to
the
pilbara
in
western
australia
for
some
strange
reason
we
in
bhp
didn
t
know
as
much
about
the
pilbara
deposit
as
we
should
have
mclennan
say
they
be
know
back
in
the
s
it
s
a
bit
of
an
indictment
for
most
of
us
and
particularly
our
geologist
that
they
hadn
t
read
up
about
these
we
have
one
geologist
who
walk
right
past
mt
newman
walk
past
it
so
that
be
bad
management
and
bad
luck
there
be
also
a
measure
of
selective
memory
in
mclennan
s
recollection
accord
to
a
mclennan
prot
g
stan
salamy
bhp
s
geological
prospector
be
order
to
confine
their
exploration
to
the
coast
as
transport
cost
be
thought
to
make
inland
iron
ore
mining
uneconomic
they
didn
t
want
to
know
about
the
inland
he
say
however
their
luck
would
soon
change
in
a
big
way
in
an
old
prospector
stan
hilditch
who
have
be
grubstaked
by
a
kalgoorlie
pump
maker
charles
warman
discover
a
massive
iron
ore
eminence
in
the
eastern
pilbara
about
five
kilometre
from
mt
newman
and
about
kilometre
from
the
coast
which
he
name
mt
whaleback
he
have
be
roam
the
north
for
about
six
year
in
an
old
thames
truck
with
his
wife
ella
on
a
budget
of
a
week
and
when
he
told
warman
of
his
discovery
his
partner
be
unimpressed
look
stan
he
say
iron
ore
be
a
cheap
commodity
it
s
too
far
from
the
coast
i
suggest
you
forget
it
at
the
time
joe
lyon
decision
to
ban
all
iron
export
remain
in
force
so
the
discovery
be
of
little
value
but
in
john
mcewen
take
a
submission
to
cabinet
back
by
bhp
argue
for
the

to

menzies
agree
and
unbeknown
to
anyone
in

include
bhp
hilditch
and

pegged
their

mclennan
shortly
afterwards
two
executive
from
the

american
miner

when
their

while
they

someone
mention

there
be
a

warman
nearby
who
reckons
that
he
s
get
an
iron
ore

would
you
like
to
meet
him
the
american
jumped
at
the
chance
and
after
do
a
deal
that
would
turn
warman
and
hilditch
into
multimillionaires
sought
out
an

for

they

then
run

sir
james
vernon

jim
vernon
knew
a
good
thing
when
he
saw
one
he
latch
on
to
this
but
then
between
them
they
couldn
t
do
it
so
vernon
come
and
saw
us
i
thought
oh
gosh
here
s
the
opportunity
what
follow
be
tremendous
negotiation
from
which
bhp
end
up

they
be
concerned
that
the
vietnam

which
be

rag
would
cut
the
supply
chain
from
australia
to
its
japanese
market
by
closing
the

it
be
a
serious
misjudgment
it
s
be
probably
the
most
successful
iron
ore
operation
in
the
world
mclennan
say
year
before
the
china
boom
subsequently
bhp

often
score
a
touchdown
after

trust
you
and
whom
you
trust
to
treat
you
fairly
in

it

too
soon
lonie
and
canavan
take
week
back
to
his

and
lonie
telephone
his
bos
keith
rowell
i
think
week
be
on
to
something
he
say
they
knew
from
john
norgard
s
report
that
the
american
have
indicate
southern
australia
as
the
most
promising
oil
bearing
region
but
he
have
give
no
clue
as
to
where
bhp
should
start
look
the
two
men
agree
he
should
be
invite
to
melbourne
the
follow
day
instead
of
return
to
the
united
state
on
friday
march
week
met
rowell
in
melbourne
and
told
him
he
knew
where
oil
would
be
found
but
that
he
would
speak
with
nobody
but
ian
mclennan
ushered
into
the
chief
executive
s
office
at
essington
lewis
house
the
new
company
headquarters
at
bourke
street
week
begin
cagily
nothing
be
a
hundred
per
cent
certain
in
the
oil
exploration
business
but
mclennan
would
be
wise
to
abandon
all
hope
of
a
strike
in
the
current
bhp
lease
that
s
good
mclennan
reply
it
will
save
us
some
money
week
then
say
he
knew
of
a
more
promising
area
that
be
accessible
to
per
cent
of
world
market
i
ve
be
aware
of
it
since
he
say
and
have
twice
mention
it
in
publication
in
the
s
so
the
unasked
question
hung
between
them
if
not
the
sydney
basin
then
where
week
prepared
the
ground
first
he
d
need
to
do
a
proper
magnetometer
survey
at
a
cost
of
mclennan
nod
that
would
not
be
a
problem
then
a
far
million
would
be
require
for
seismic
survey
bhp
s
net
profit
for
be
just
million
and
these
be
enormous
amount
but
mclennan
kept
his
nerve
he
accepted
that
figure
too
then
there
be
the
matter
of
week
s
fee
how
much
would
he
require
in
the
way
of
commission
week
have
rehearse
his
answer
his
work
have
make
billion
for
standard
oil
and
other
petroleum
leviathan
now
be
his
chance
for
a
big
pay
day
calmly
he
say
there
be
a
standard
royalty
payment
throughout
the
world
for
introduce
new
oil
and
gas
area
he
have
thought
of
ask
for
five
per
cent
but
decide
to
settle
for
half
that
amount
he
told
mclennan
he
want
a
royalty
of
per
cent
mclennan
look
him
in
the
eye
will
you
rely
on
me
to
do
the
fair
thing
he
ask
week
take
a
moment
to
size
up
the
man
at
mclennan
have
maintain
his
athletic
build
and
the
year
of
command
have
add
depth
and
gravitas
to
his
natural
warmth
of
personality
yes
the
american
say
i
will
rely
on
you
so
the
location
come
to
your
window
week
beckon
it
lie
out
there
in
bass
strait
and
most
particularly
off
the
gippsland
coast
for
a
moment
mclennan
be
speechless
bass
strait
be
notorious
for
wild
weather
and
roar
wind
its
depth
be
great
than
any
offshore
mining
so
far
attempt
the
cost
could
be
horrendous
they
would
be
operating
at
the
very
limit
of
technological
advance
yet
if
they
could
pull
it
off
the
benefit
to
the
company
and
to
australia
would
be
massive
mclennan
offer
his
hand
week
take
it
mclennan
would
be
as
good
as
his
word
when
the
massive
bass
strait
field
be
discover
week
would
make
many
million
from
his
per
cent
royalty
the
episode
be
a
powerful
legend
within
bhp
week
be
romanticise
almost
as
much
as
charles
rasp
however
the
behind
the
scene
reality
be
even
more
engage
and
be
reveal
here
for
the
first
time
it
involves
an
eminent
australian
professor
of
geology
samuel
warren
carey
who
until
now
have
be
overlook
in
the
history
of
bhp
yet
without
carey
s
input
it
be
at
best
highly
unlikely
that
the
american
would
have
be
able
to
lead
bhp
to
the
vast
oil
reservoir
beneath
bass
strait
there
be
no
doubt
whatever
about
the
importance
that
week
attach
to
professor
carey
s
work
even
before
he
have
set
foot
in
australia
week
travel
the
short
distance
between
his
westport
home

and
he
have
to

he
literally

a
concept
he
pursue
and

for
the

business
bhp
paid
little
attention
instead
of
commission
rudd
to
explore
for
oil
it
put
him
to
work
estimate
its
iron

even
after
he
have

he
have
little
success

persuade

that
lewis

make
out
in

have
never

he
claim
to
have
study
the

as
early
as
after
what
he
describes
as
a
chance
conversation
in
downtown
manhattan
with
an
old

prospector
who
have
advise

he
put
it

about
such
an
eventuality
i
haven
t
get
a
suitable
salt
cellar
here
to
take
a
pinch
of
salt
he
say
i
know
carey
do
talk
to
lewis
week
about
bass
strait
but
what
they
discuss
i
don
t
know
nor
do
i
remember
precisely
when
it
be
but
he
do
there
s
no
two
way
about
that
in
a
letter
in
the
author
possession
carey
told
his
son
dr
harley
carey
when
i
be
at
yale
week
visit
me
many
time
to
discus
the
structure
of
bass
strait
the
issue
clearly
disturbed
him
before
his
death
on
march
at
the
age
of
carey
left
the
follow
account
of
his
meeting
with

i
be
in
the

when
i
felt
a
tap
on
my
shoulder
it
be

he
say
i
have
be
look
for
you
may
we
have
coffee
together
i
believe
you

i

summarize
my
anzaas
australian
and
new

association
for
the
advancement
of
science
address
lewis
paid
close
attention
and
ask
several
critical
question
next
day
he
again
sought
me
out
with
typical
week
thoroughness
he
have
carefully
consider
what
i
have
say
and
come
back
with
several
relevant
question
from
it
a
couple
of
month
later
in
hobart
i
have
a
telephone
call
from
him
he
have
come
to
melbourne
at
the
request
of
haematite
proprietary
the
petroleum
exploration
subsidiary
of
bhp
and
immediately
told
them
he
be
go
to
hobart
to
see
carey
he
brought
with
him
brian
hopkins
haematite
chief
geologist
and
another
from
bhp
we
met
at
wrest
point
and
spent
a
couple
of
hour
discuss
the
structure
of
bass
strait
in
i
go
to
israel
as
a
un
technical
adviser
and
in
april
report
to
the
un
headquarters
in
new
york
on
april
i
attend
a
lecture
at
the
new
york
academy
of
science
and
found
lewis
week
be
the
chairman
he
ask
me
to
visit
him
next
day
at
his
home
in
connecticut
i
have
rent
an
avis
car
so
i
drove
up
there
arrive
mid
morning
by
this
time
the
airborne
magnetic
reconnaissance
have
cover
the
whole
of
bass
strait
and
the
more
promising
structure
so
indicate
have
be
cover
by
ship
borne
seismic
reflection
traverse
week
and
i
spent
the
rest
of
the
morning
sprawl
on
the
carpet
pore
over
the
map
and
gloat
over
the
prospect
so
reveal
with
his
wife
we
go
out
to
lunch
at
the
village
and
come
back
for
another
session
on
bass
strait
we
agree
that
the
structure
off
gippsland
look
excellent
there
appear
to
be
several
close
structure
with
thousand
of
foot
of
sediment
under
them
and
these
sediment
thin
out
progressively
towards
the
shore
pinch
out
at
the
lake
entrance
unconformity
where
the
basal
sandstone
be
saturate
with
oil
these
structure
just
have
to
trap
oil
or
gas
or
both
i
ask
him
how
he
intend
to
proceed
because
bhp
who
held
the
licence
through
their
subsidiary
haematite
have
no
expertise
in
petroleum
drilling
or
production
even
on
land
and
still
less
at
sea
and
marine
exploration
be
still
in
its
infancy
especially
in
notoriously
rough
seaway
like
bass
strait
he
told
me
he
have
offer
it
to
shell
but
they
have
turn
it
down
but
he
have
some
old
standard
oil
contact
who
he
thought
he
could
interest
in
it
they
have
already
have
rough
sea
drilling
experience
in
cook
inlet
which
be
every
bit
as
stormy
as
bass
strait
one
of
professor
carey
s
postgraduate
student
dr
andy
kugler
of
austin
texas
recall
a
lecture
in
which
carey
discuss
oil
potential
in
australia
particularly
in
bass
strait
just
prior
to
that
he
have
be
contact
by
lewis
week
with
respect
to
where
they
should
be
look
for
oil
in
australia
that
be
what
sam
carey
actually
told
us
in
the
lecture
kugler
say
prof
have
suggest
there
be
a
big
fault
zone
between
australia
and
tasmania
and
there
be
maybe
up
to
a
hundred
mile
of
horizontal
offset
between
the
structure
of
tasmania
and
the
structure
of
australia
in
the
zone
between
which
be
bass
strait
there
have
developed
a
basin
which
as
far
as
could
be
told
from
onshore
be
get
into
the
cretaceous
period
of
the
mesozoic
age
which
be
responsible
for
a
lot
of
the
world
s
oil
so
on
that
basis
he
direct
lewis
week
to
bass
strait
as
a
place
that
bhp
should
be
look
for
oil
as
far
as
i
know
that
s
the
only
reason
lewis
week
suggest
they
look
there
it
be
a
fairly
straightforward
lecture
that
prof
give
and
there
be
no
reason
to
believe
he
be
embellish
anything
he
be
say
okay
lewis
if
you
want
to
find
oil
in
australia
this
be
the
place
you
want
to
go
prof
do
not
get
any
payment
for
his
input
but
i
never
heard
him
bitch
about
it
the
geological
society
of
australia
state
unequivocally
lewis
week
base
on
his
knowledge
of
the
lake
entrance
oil
shaft
and
carey
s
sketch
map
of
anticlines
extend
into
the
offshore
gippsland
basin
lead
bhp
to
take
up
exploration
acreage
professor
quilty
add
sam
s
idea
on
the
evolution
of
the
gippsland
basin
be
critical
absolutely
critical
to
the
exploration
of
bass
strait
ian
mclennan
be
unaware
of
sam
carey
s
input
when
confront
with
the
decision
whether
or
not
to
proceed
with
the
oil
project
in
bass
strait
once
again
the
government

not
recall
with
unalloyed
pleasure
by
either
party
mclennan
who
have
become
bhp
chairman
in
approach
gorton
with
one
of
the
more
remarkable
proposal
in
australia
s
industrial
history
to
reduce
the
oil
price
by
a
dollar
from
the
mcewen
figure
to
us
thus
cut
directly
into
bhp
s
profit
mclennan
s
reason
be
that
the
mcewen
price
be
design
to
make
the
relatively
small
australian
producer
such
as
moonie
and
rom
in
queensland
viable
entity
it
be
not
design
for
the
massive
flow
from
bass
strait
at
the
time
import
oil
be
us
a
barrel
accord
to
mclennan
gorton
be
most
enthusiastic
that
s
the
most
statesman
like
thing
i
ve
ever
heard
of
he
say
at
the
end
of
the
discussion
mclennan
go
to
america
only
to
receive
an
emergency
telephone
call
from
chairman
colin
syme
to
say
the
issue
have
blown
up
and
he
d
well
return
immediately
i
found
that
mr
gorton
have
repudiate
this
arrangement
and
he
wish
to
have
far
negotiation
we
saw
him
and
hewitt
at
the
lodge
because
mr
gorton
have
some
fear
of
leakage
take
place
this
be
a
most
difficult
period
indeed
we
obviously
adopt
the
attitude
that
we
thought
we
d
do
jolly
well
in
reduce
the
price
by
a
dollar
well
it
finish
up
we
get
virtually
import
parity
for
the
oil
mclennan
and
esso
s
norton
belnap
do
secure
an
agreement
that
all
the
australian
refinery
have
to
use
australian
crude
only
the
finish
product
could
be
import
but
it
prove
to
be
of
little
advantage
after
the
opec
country
start
to
put
up
the
price
of
oil
in
everybody
want
the
low
price
australian
crude
by
then
bhp
be
have
to
deal
with
an
entirely
new
phenomenon
at
the
national
level
the
labor
government
of
gough
whitlam
which
still
carry
within
its
rank
hard
men
wield
the
barely
conceal
baton
of
nationalisation
most
prominent
among
them
be
the
long
time
member
for
the
wollongong
area
r
f
x
rex
connor
who
not
only
secure
the
ministry
of
mineral
and
energy
but
lenox
hewitt
as
his
department
s
permanent
head
mclennan
be
aghast
he
have
dealt
congenially
and
profitably
with
state
labor
government
over
the
decade
but
connor
quickly
become
bhp
s
b
te
noire
he
never
once
achieve
ministerial
status
in
the
state
parliament
where
he
be
a
member
for
many
year
mclennan
say
in
canberra
however
his
formidable
bulk
conspiratorial
reason
and
uncompromising
delivery
disarm
whitlam
who
promote
him
to
high
cabinet
office
indeed
on
one
occasion
when
both
whitlam
and
deputy
prime

jim
cairn
be
out
of
the
country
he
briefly
become
act
prime

he
be
so
he
say
a
great
one
for
australia
develop
its
own
resource
mclennan
say
i
think
the
real
fact
of
the
matter
be
he
be
a
great
one
for
socialise
resource
happily
for
bhp
connor

career
crashed
in

when
in

of

socialise
agenda
he
attempt
to
borrow
million
in
petro

use
a
shady
pakistani
go

after
whitlam
have
revoke
his
authority
to
do
so
hewitt
s
public
service
career
effectively
flame
out
at
the
same
time
moreover
the
change
of
the
guard
in
the
labor
party
would
usher
in
a
somewhat
surprising
champion
of
the
company
s
cause
in
paul
john
keating
who
succeed
connor
in
opposition
as
the
party
s
spokesman
for
mineral
and
energy
primarily
the
business
i
m
in
and
have
always
be
in
be
the
nation
building
business
keating
say
he
be
sit
at
a
beautifully
polished
antique
table
in
his
potts
point
sydney
office
in
he
be
dress
in
olive
corduroy
an
open
necked
shirt
and
casual
jacket
with
patch
leather
elbow
i
be
always
sympathetic
to
bhp
he
say
if
only
because
anyone
who
can
build
something
that
large
any
group
its
interest
require
consideration
and
they
always
have
consideration
from
me
he
recall
his
first
interaction
with
the
company
i
have
a
call
one
saturday
morning
from
ian
mclennan
it
must
have
be
about
or
say
that
bhp
have
have
an
approach
from
the
burmah
oil
company
for
bhp
to
take
over
their
concession
on
the
north
west
shelf
it
use
to
be
call
woodside
burma
or
burma
woodside
and
what
attitude
would
i
take
because
he
say
to
get
the
project
up
it
would
take
the
life
of
a
number
of
government
so
represent
the
australian
labor
party
what
attitude
would
i
take
to
bhp
acquire
an
interest
i
say
well
i
would
encourage
you
to
acquire
it
he
say
i
didn
t
expect
that
answer
i
say
i
would
encourage
you
to
acquire
it
because
i
think
this
be
the
last
of
the
mohican
he
ask
me
what
i
meant
by
that
and
i
say
well
the
increase
in
oil
price
to
us
us
a
barrel
in
the
opec
induced
increase
lift
the
price
of
all
hydrocarbon
therefore
if
we
could
get
the
japanese
interested
to
take
contract
then
we
should
take
it
because
if
it
s
a
cartel
hold
up
the
price
then
inevitably
the
price
will
fall
and
then
the
chance
of
us
be
able
to
pick
up
a
contract
that
large
six
million
tonne
three
train
of
gas
at
two
million
tonne
each
would
be
slim
so
i
say
you
can
say
that
this
project
would
have
the
support
of
the
opposition
so
then
that
give
him
a
fair
degree
of
comfort
and
i
think
the
kind
of
encouragement
to
go
ahead
and
take
the
burma
interest
when
they
met
shortly
afterwards
keating
offer
to
take
the
matter
far
i
say
if
you
like
because
this
be
a
really
long
project
i
will
put
support
for
it
in
the
labor
party
platform
keating
say
so
at
the
next
meeting
of
the
national
conference
of
the
labor
party
either
or
i
put
an
express
provision
in
that
we
would
support
the
development
of
the
north
west
shelf
gas
field
so
that
meant
we
have
a
policy
rather
than
a
wink
from
some
shadow
spokesman
s
eye
from
the
perspective
of
mclennan
say
there
be
three
major
date
in
the
history
of
the
company
the
first
be
when
broken
hill
be
found
the
second
be
when
the
decision
be
make
to
start
in
steel
and
the
third
be
when
it
decide
to
go
into
the
oil
business
the
entry
into
oil
and
gas
have
a
most
major
effect
on
the
company
it
s
make
it
possible
to
develop
in
all
sort
of
other
way
it
s
kept
it
as
the
large
company
in
australia
it
be
indeed
the
big
australian
chapter
the
image
maker
the
gorton
and
connor
imbroglio
brought
home
to
bhp
s
senior
executive
the
need
to
resurrect
the
in
house
lobbying
operation
once
driven
by
james
menzies
but
which
have
seem
superfluous
through
the
long
year
of
menzies
mcewen
rule
during
the
s
and
s
accord

never
do
want
to
go
rush
to
the
government
for
every
little
thing
that
happen
but
we
do
want
them
to
understand
our
point
of
view
on
various
thing

that

of

but
they
didn
t
call
me
the
advertising
manager
she
say
they
call
me
a
public
relation
officer
her
early
experience
say
much
about
the
company
s
ethos
the
personnel
manager
say
to
me
and
he
didn
t
say
it
unkindly
he
be
prepare
me
he
say
woman
in
this
company

the
status
of

laugh
i
have
the
medical
and
fail
miserably
because
i
didn
t
have
two
testis
which
be
one
of
the
requirement
however
work
with
derek
sawer
help
juliana
over
the
early
rough
spot
i
actually
found
they
be
a
very
fair
company
with
a
very
fair
ethos
after
two
year
they
face
up
to
the
fact
that
i
be
do
the
job
without
the
title
and
put
me
on
the
executive
staff
once
i
blend
in
i
be
fine
there
be
a
special
din
room
in
the
new
building
and
i
must
say
it
be
a
fascinate
phenomenon
you
d
go
to
lunch
and
sit
at
a
big
table
where
there
d
be
people
from
the
shipyard
and
from
the
iron
ore
mine
and
the
oil
and
gas
field
all
feed
in
bit
of
information
there
be
this
fabulous
cohesive
sense
of
be
part
of
something
her
principal
task
be
to
help
develop
the
all
important
image
because
the
company
be
so
big
it
be
always
worried
about
be
see
as
be
too
powerful
and
too
influential
this
be
when
there
be
all
that
anti
cartel
legislation
in
america
it
be
always
a
worry
that
they
be
earn
big
profit
and
that
the
profit
be
in
proportion
to
the
capital
be
invest
it
be
my
job
to
put
it
all
in
perspective
another
priority
be
to
secure
recruit
for
the
trainee
scheme
which
be
now
intrinsic
to
the
company
s
modus
operandi
corporate
image
in
the
s
be
about
try
to
attract
the
best
young
graduate
she
say
and
you
didn
t
do
that
if
the
literature
you
be
put
out
to
university
be
old
fashion
and
fuddy
duddy
i
be
do
very
up
to
the
moment
stuff
to
try
to
make
it
attractive
just
try
to
present
the
company
as
a
good
employer
and
a
good
australian
her
own
experience
with
the
men
at
the
top
reinforce
her
commitment
to
the
job
colin
syme
now
knight
personify
much
that
be
good
about
the
company
he
be
the
epitome
of
the
old
class
of
director
total
probity
not
about
money
another
world
altogether
corporate
greed
just
hadn
t
happen
she
say
he
drove
a
very
well
polished
well
love
old
holden
i
thought
it
be
wonderful
that
instead
of
have
a
very
smart
car
he
have
a
nice
old
car
he
could
have
have
all
sort
of
thing
but
that
wasn
t
the
way
they
do
it
at
bhp
everything
be
do
well
but
not
flashily
mclennan
be
the
same
they
be
very
solid
citizen
another
indicator
of
the
bhp
way
be
the
preference
of
top
executive
for
the
australian
club
in
william
street
rather
than
the
high
profile
and
more
snobbish
melbourne
club
in
collins
street
found
in
the
australian
club
become
something
of
a
bhp
institution
harvey
patterson
who
be
elect
to
membership
in
be
one
of
the
first
bhp
director
he
be
join
by
the
first
chairman
arthur
blackwood
and
after
william
knox
sign
up
in
they
establish
a
bhp
table
in
the
din
room
at
the
australian
club
they
could
promote
the
company
s
interest
with
fellow
industrialist
in
relaxed
surroundings
and
by
the
s
colin
syme
and
a
later
chairman
sir
james
balderstone
become
president
of
the
club
it
be
a
measure
of
the
esteem
in
which
derek
sawer
be
held
that
he
too
be
invite
to
join
the
club
be
a
significant
element
in
the
continue
development
of
the
company
s
image
so
too
be
the
fact
that
many
of
the
top
executive
have
start
their
work
life
as
bhp
trainee
both
brian
loton
who
follow
mclennan
and
james
mcneill
the
chairman
after
sir
colin
syme
have
begin
as
trainee
accord
to
juliana
hooper
at
the
time
i
be
there
a
lot
of
very
senior
management
be
people
who
have
start
with
the
company
virtually
when
they
be
so
it
wasn
t
patrician
a
lot
of
the
management
be
actually
meritocracy
sir
colin
be
a
lawyer
whereas
the
next
two
chairman
mcneill
and
mclennan
be
company
officer
who
have
come
up
through
the
rank
throughout
the
s
the
whole
public
relation
strategy
would
become
one
of
the
most
potent
force
in
the
company
s
armoury
and
by
the
end
of
the
decade
when
once
more
they
have
the
friendly
ear
of
a
coalition
government
under
malcolm
fraser
and
mcewen
s
successor
doug
anthony
they
have
built
the
image
of
the
company
to
command
height
derek
sawer
left
in
when
mclennan
retire
he
say
it
be
expect
that
fred
rich
would
follow
him
as
ceo
he
be
general
manager
administration
and
we
all
want
him
to
take
over
but
he
go
home
one
night
sat
on
his
sofa
and
die
the
board
insist
on
bring
in
one
of
those
british
headhunting
firm
to
find
the
successor
i
wasn
t
inclined
to
wait
around
he
bought
a
sail
boat
and
a
home
at
the
coastal
town
of
portsea
he
become
a
ship
s
chandler
juliana
hooper
say
he
love
his
boat
while
the
company
sought
sawer
s
replacement
his
role
be
fill
temporarily
by
ian
crawford
who
begin
with
the
company
in
the
s
as
the
public
relation
officer
for
the
oil
and
gas
division
he
be
in
a
very
different
mould
juliana
hooper
say
while
he
have
report
to
sawer
crawford
s
american
connection
through
esso
meant
he
enjoy
a
measure
of
independence
he
also
have
a
more
aggressive
approach
to
the
task
however
he
be
pass
over
for
the
permanent
role
in
favour
of
sydney

when
he
apply
for
the
bhp
job
he
have
a
lengthy
interview
with
chairman
jim
mcneill
it
reveal
the
comparative
naivety
of
the
company
in
present
itself
to
the
world
we
talk
about
this
and
that
for
some
time
which
amuse
me
because
it
didn
t
revolve
around
what
the
real
business
be
he
say
so
finally
i
say
should
i
take
up
this
position
or
you
appoint
me
what
would
you
expect
me
to
do
and
he
say
well
we
expect
you
to
tell
us
what
to
do
that
be
the
sort
of
relationship
that
be
expect
at
the
begin
in
fact
senior
executive
and
the
board
would
soon
be
swept
up
in
a
sharp
learn
curve
as
the
company
become
embroil
in
a
takeover
battle
but
in
april
maund
look
forward
to
a
relatively
peaceful
life
as
director
of
public
affair
and
government
relation
the
chief
public
relation
concern
be
with
the
steel
factory
which
be
shed
worker
in
an
attempt
to
stay
competitive
with
their
international
rival
but
with
a
change
of
government
in
prime
minister
bob
hawke
and
treasurer
paul
keating
create
a
new
paradigm
or
so
the
pr
team
believe
it
become
pretty
apparent
that
we
have
to
step
up
our
deal
with
government
maund
say
despite
keating
s
present
day
protestation
that
he
give
the
company
special
consideration
maund
say
that
publicly
at
least
there
be
no
love
lose
between
keating
and
bhp
he
always
use
to
have
a
go
at
bhp
whenever
he
could
paul
keating
thought
bhp
be
the
epitome
of
evil
and
the
people
who
ran
it
be
evil
people
who
be
rapacious
so
we
appoint
jock
mcgregor
full
time
in
canberra
he
later
become
company
secretary
of
bhp
in
fact
keating
say
i
do
bhp
an
inordinate
number
of
favour
in
bass
strait
as
treasurer
over
the
year
bass
strait
be
characterise
by
these
small
hydrocarbon
pinchouts
outside
the
main
reservoir
and
what
the
commonwealth
use
to
do
be
second
guess
the
production
cost
and
put
on
differential
excise
per
field
that
meant
that
some
gas
reserve
would
be
left
they
wouldn
t
do
them
because
it
wasn
t
worth
their
while
to
do
them
so
i
do
them
a
big
favour
i
thought
in
term
of
efficiency
in
that
i
change
the
tax
treatment
of
bass
strait
so
that
the
field
be
taxed
as
one
so
they
could
make
their
own
choice
about
whether
they
developed
this
field
or
that
field
and
this
brought
far
more
rationality
into
the
development
nevertheless
the
perception
be
that
keating
be
hostile
to
the
company
and
mcgregor
be
join
in
canberra
by

so
we
spar
no

the
result
be
a
coffee
table
size
tome
when
i
read
it
recently
i
thought
it
be
corny
he
say
by
the
mid

bhp
be
able
to
point
to
a

that
meant

alone
support
almost
people
at
a

when
the

of
the

the
northern

together
numbered
few

meanwhile
the

australian
tag
have
enter
the

it
be
one
of
derek
sawer
s
coup
actually
maund
say
the
herald
newspaper
and
others
be
a
bit
sour
about
bhp
particularly
its
size
and
there
be
a
great
hubbub
for
example
when
the
first
profit
of
million
be
announce
it
be
sneer
at
and
this
phrase
the
big
australian
be
use
by
the
herald
in
a
derogatory
sense
however
derek
thought
let
s
make
the
best
of
it
and
he
turn
it
into
something
to
make
people
feel
good
about

maund
entrench
the

a

of
the
senior

have
their
ground
at
newcastle
or
wollongong
he
say
so
it
be
not
only
the
outward
symbol
of
bhp
but
it
be
indicative
of
the
general
culture
his
new
logo
a
stylise
map
of
australia
incorporate
the
bhp
initial
signal

for
each
of
the

red
for
steel
blue
for

and
so
on
but
it
be
also
an
attempt
to
change
the
think
it
have
the
great
advantage
of
reflect

her
gender
much
less
a
problem
than
it
have
be
for
juliana
hooper
my
big
problem
be
that
public
affair
didn
t
have
a
lot
of
credibility
on
my
arrival
because
it
wasn
t
give
a
high

and
didn
t
have
a

of
influence
she

be
central
to

i
get
on
very
well
with

more
of

i
can
all
that
bill

stuff
she
recall
harry

rang
me
up
and
say
that
i
be
destroy
the
reputation
of
the
company
and
damage
the
image
of

we
weren
t
a
consumer
brand
you
don
t
do
mass
advertising
for
an
organisation
like
bhp
my
focus
be
on
building
image
in
the
community
where
we
operate
the
money
that
i
save
on
that
i

i
could
see
that
the
environment
be
go
to
be
a
major

of
concern
so
i
set
up
an

to
do
an

of
the

a

she

i
would
accompany
the
head
of
the
relevant

would
work
with
him
on
a
strategy
to

paul

say

the
question
about

its

vi
vi
the
interest
of
australia
often
coincides
and
often
the
political
system
would
do
them
a
favour
but
the
favour
would
more
often
than
not
scrub
up
as
good
policy
in
other
word
they
be
not
give
a
favour
out
of
bad
policy
they
be
give
a
favour
out
of
good
policy
and
whenever
they
push
the
limit
too
much
and
they
do
this
occasionally
then
sometimes
they
d
stub
their
toe
and
get
a
no
but
they
always
take
the
opportunity
of
discuss
their
circumstance
before
they
move
on
thing
often
a
no
for
bhp
would
not
be
a
bald
public
no
it
would
be
a
soft
private
no
way
ahead
of
anything
they
might
otherwise
have
do

it
s
probably
true
to
say
that
both
political
party
have
have
an
upbeat
view
of

certainly
the

party
have
and
for
those
in
the

party
interested

and
i
be
one
the
background
think
which
we

while
the
dramatic
purchase
of
utah
international
described
in
the
follow
chapter
have
brought
some
of
the
rich
coal
mine
of
central
queensland
into
the
bhp
fold
loton
and
mclennan
also
engage
macquarie
bank
s
executive
director
graeme
samuel
and
morgan
stanley
s
vice
president
charles
tait
to
fend
off
the
raid
samuel
say
i
spent
oh
gosh
month
almost
every
day
up
at
bhp
on
the
executive
floor
there
in
what
be
call
the
bunker
assist
in
the
various
matter
we
have
to
deal
with
in
term
of
the
takeover
by
holmes
court
the
initial
catalyst
of
the
process
be
when
potter
partner
which
traditionally
have
be
the
broking
house
of
bhp
decide
to
act
as
the
broker
for
bell
resource
in
the
acquisition
of
share
in
bhp
and
that
cause
a
great
deal
of
consternation
at
bhp
because
they
felt
that
potter
have
switch
horse
we
d
be
brought
in
to
advise
and
assist
in
the
whole
series
of
process
that
occur
over
many
many
month
one
problem
he
say
be
derek
sawer
s
public
relation
coup
over
the
big
australian
nickname
that
be
not
good
because
it
be
focus
on
the
big
rather
than
the
australian
big
be
not
necessarily
good
secondly
we
be
in
the
midst
of
an
entrepreneurial
boom
and
the
takeover
merchant
be
see
as
the
great
hero
of
the
share
market
if
you
weren
t
one
of
them
you
be
see
as
be
staid
stodgy
conservative
ripe
for
takeover
and
appropriate
to
be
take
over
however
he
say
the
big
challenge
be
the
corporate
law
that
permit
partial
takeover
in
the
wake
of
a
bid
the
big
institution
would
sell
most
of
their
share
to
secure
the
takeover
premium
while
small
shareholder
would
hold
on
but
once
the
acquisition
be
complete
and
the
takeover
premium
disappear
the
institution
would
buy
back
into
the
company
at
the
low
price
indeed
samuel
recall
the
outrageous
threat
make
by
some
institution
to
macquarie
bank
demand
that
they
back
off
and
permit
the
takeover
to
succeed
there
be
one
particular
institution
that
behave
very
very
badly
he
say
an
investment
fund
manager
that
behave
very
badly
indeed
samuel
be
also
caught
in
a
clash
of
culture
while
holmes
court
operate
almost
alone
bhp
have
a
system
of
institutional
governance
that
make
tactical
manoeuvre
difficult
we
spent
week
with
the
bhp
executive
analyse
who
would
be
best
to
approach
robert
holmes
court
to
talk
to
him
he
say
i
felt
the
best
thing
be
to
pick
up
the
phone
and
ring
him
but
no
we
have
to
work
out
who
would
be
the
best
person
finally
samuel
call
holmes
court
s
lawyer
peter
petrachus
whom
he
knew
and
they
arrange
a
meeting
at
holmes
court
s
spring
street
apartment
in
melbourne
s
cbd
he
be
quite
a
strange
individual
he
say
he
be
a
combination
of
strange
and
charm
he
would
often
let
you
sit
there
for
half
an
hour
without
say
a
word
meanwhile
peter
maund
have
be
extremely
industrious
we
decide
to
make
much
more
noise
in
the
community
he
say
until
then
bhp
prefer
not
to
beat
the
drum
too
much
in
public
but
because
of
the
need
to
win
heart
and
mind
suddenly
my
budget
go
up
in
one
year
to
million
to
spread
the
word
almost
overnight
he
create
the
bhp
award
for
the
institute
of
excellence
and
invite
new
south
wale
governor
sir
roden
cutler
vc
as
the
chief
judge
it
be
nationally
televise
he
say
that
be
part
of
the
push
to
improve
the
image
of
bhp
in
the
mind
of
the
people
and
to
try
to
impress
upon
them
that
it
should
not
be
broken
up
other
initiative
follow
in
quick
succession
an
advertising
campaign
with
the
new
company
logo
feature
the
stylise
map
of
australia
blanket
the
airwave
the
other
wing
of
it
be
the
measure
of
the
effect
of
the
campaign
particularly
with
shareholder
maund
say
previously
it
be
quite
difficult
to
get
the
board
to
take
opinion
poll
seriously
now
they
commission
a
wide
range
of
private
poll
not
just
the
general
public
but
socioeconomic
breakdown
and
most
particularly
the
shareholder
we
need
a
huge
majority
of
the
mum
and
dad
investor
to
believe
that
the
invader
should
be
repel
and
as
it
turn
out
the
ordinary
non
institutional
shareholder
be
per
cent
fiercely
oppose
to
any
break
up
of
bhp
this
be
important
not
only
to
have
in
the
armoury
in
case
of
an
extraordinary
general
meeting
where
the
shareholder
vote
would
count
but
also
to
use
to
show
them
there
be
a
solid
backing
for
the
company
jim
mcneill
be
due
to
step
down
as
chairman
in
mid
and
be
replace
by
sir
james
balderstone
while
holmes
court
s
bid
be
still
on
the
table
the
outgo
and
incoming
chairman
flew
to
london
in
april
to
reassure
the
london
investment
community
that
they
have
no
intention
of
allow
this
interloper
to
interfere
with
bhp
s
operation
indeed
the
bell
offer
succeed
in
boost
holmes
court
s
stake
in
bhp
to
just
per
cent
bhp
s
shareholder
have
no
reason
to
regret
their
decision
to
stick
with
the
management
when
brian
loton
report
a
profit
of
million
for
the
previous
fiscal
year
a
figure
greatly
enhance
by
his
achievement
in
retool
the
steel
division
which
have
suffer
from
a
slump
in
world
price
since
and
have
desperately
need
modernisation
but
these
be
no
more
than
preliminary
round
to
the
main
event
and
they
attract
little
more
than
passing
interest
from
john
elliott
who
be
busy
expand
elder
operation
in
south
east
asia
and
elsewhere
elliott
have
attend
the
university
of
melbourne
on
a
bhp
scholarship
and
the
prop
be
his
first
employer
the
problem
with
bhp
in
those
day
be
it
be
a
great
bureaucracy
dominate
by
the
steel
business
he
say
i
d
do
an
honour
degree
in
economics
and
it
didn
t
seem
to
be
the
opportunity
to
the
road
to
which
i
aspire
i
think
they
lose
most
of
the
scholarship
holder
some
pretty
smart
guy
after
i
do
my
mba
in
i
join
mckinsey
the
new

end
up
chairman
of
cra
conzinc
rio
tinto
of
australia
be
the
senior
partner
in
australia
my
first
job
there
be
to

off
where
bhp
be
go
to
use
mckinsey
or
one
of
the
other
consult
firm
so
i
spent
the
first
three
month

bhp
we
didn
t
get
the
job
john
elliott
start
to
take
a
closer
interest
in

through

whereas

he

he
get
up

say
we
have
to
figure
out
how
we
could
get
some
additional
strength
into

then
we
realise
bhp
be
in
trouble
and
that
holmes

them
indeed

will
ensure
that

he
told

yearly
result
in
the
end
someone

badly
burn
it
won
t

i
presume
you

holmes

told
him
the
price

high
and
i

happy
control
himself
with
some
difficulty
balderstone
reply
i
don
t
think
that
s
the
situation
but
holmes
court
continued
you
previously
refuse
us
a
seat
on
the
board
when
i
hadn

holmes

s
response
be
well
that

brian

we

very
important
part

balderstone
raise
the
question
of
a
strategic
defence
over
lunch
with
john

and
suggest
that
elliott
speak
to
brian

we
be
chat
to
bhp
just
socially
elliott
say
we
say
we

offer
you
a
bit
of
free
tactical
advice
i
ll
send
my
best
strategist
in
peter
scanlon
and
see
if
we
can
work
out
a
defence
for
you
holmes
court
be
play
the
option
market
pretty
well
and
he
be
force
the
price
up
he
be
buying
his
option
then
buying
the
stock
against
his
option
make
money
on
his
option
it
be
a
very
clever
ploy
he
be
gain
more
and
more
share
there
s
no
doubt
bhp
would
have
be
take
over
if
we
hadn
t
intervene
as
elliott
saw
it
bhp
s
problem
be
that
its
executive
didn
t
have
those
sort
of
skill
takeover
be
not
in
their
bag
of
trick
they
be
a
big
organisation
and
they
felt
they
couldn
t
be
vulnerable
because
they
be
bhp
very
much
a
head
in
the
sand
attitude
although
they
d
do
very
well
in
oil
iron
ore
and
coal
the
mentality
of
the
company
be
still
the
steel
business
most
of
the
people
like
brian
loton
and
the
others
have
all
come
up
through
steel
in
the
bhp
bunker
adjoin
the

the
eight

by
david

and
graeme

rule
to

that

sensitive

numbered
with
the
instruction
that
they
be
to

once
dealt
with
peter
maund
say
one
even
we
gather
to
wait
for
loton
to
return
from
a
meeting
with
holmes
that
s
how
the
bunker
people
identify
him
their
meeting
be
held
in
a
hotel
suite
at
the
top
of
collins
street
loton
return
and
report
that
upon
meeting
he
and
holmes
sat
and
have
a
short
exchange
then
holmes
sat
silent
loton
be
not
go
to
blink
so
they
both
sat
without
speak
eventually
loton
decide
to
end
the
game
and
strode
out
the
chief
executive
officer
then
open
a
new
front
where
he
believe
bhp
would
have
a
natural
advantage
a
direct
appeal
to
the
federal
government
treasurer
paul
keating
be
sympathetic
to
bhp
s
cause
but
troubled
by
the
request
brian
loton
who
s
a
substantial
bloke
come
to
see
me
and
bob
hawke
want
us
to
stop
holmes
court
acquire
the
company
he
say
i
say
to
him
brian
i
don
t
know
how
you
can
ask
us
to
say
that
someone
who
want
to
buy
your
share
on
the
market
can
t
buy
them
even
though
i
would
have
like
to
have
do
brian
a
favour
i
didn
t
quite
see
how
we
could
nevertheless
he
and
hawke
arrange
for
the
company
to
put
their
case
to
a
full
cabinet
meeting
the
chairman
and
all
the
executive
director
of
the
company
come
with
a
bevy
of
lawyer
include
their
spokesman
graeme
samuel
keating
say
there
would
have
be
about
or
of
them
they
sat
on
one
side
of
the
cabinet
room
around
the
old
cabinet
table
the
square
one
they
take
up
one
side
of
the
square
and
they
go
on
with
their
case
and
we
heard
them
sympathetically
samuel
have
a
different
memory
it
be
a
very
uncomfortable
experience
he
say
i
never
want
to
do
it
never
thought
it
be
the
wise
thing
to
do
and
when
you
don
t
feel
comfortable
about
the
argument
it
s
very
difficult
indeed
so
i
be
in
rather
an
invidious
position
and
appropriately
the
government
minister
particularly
keating
and
gareth
evans
tore
us
to
shred
they
just
say
you
know
you
ve
get
no
right
to
be
here
keating
say
that
brian
loton
spoke
to
him
after
the
meeting
i
say
we
ll
have
holmes
court
there
in
the
cabinet
room
tomorrow
and
he
say
i
know
paul
i
ve
get
to
tell
you
he
s
fantastic
you
know
he
s
his
own
financial
adviser
his
own
lawyer
his

analyst
and
his

he

and
the
next
day
we

holmes

and
he
just
come
in
by
himself
he
have
answer
to
all
the
thing
we
raise
if
you
have
to
score
the
event
he
won

his
logic
be
more
compelling
the
delivery
of

he

recommend
the

to
a

the
follow
morning
john

told
the

representative
holmes

be
go
to
fix
you
right
up
but
bhp
be
still
reluctant
to
embrace
any
scheme
that
involve
invest
in
elder
and
turn
down
every
one
of
elliott
s
proposal
graeme
samuel
say
that
at
one
meeting
elliott
fatally
alienate
the
bhp
executive
although
elliott
be
part
of
the
establishment
in
just
one
movement
they
push
them
too
far
and
it
get
the
board
very
much
on
the
defensive
he
say
i
think
they
demand
the
chairmanship
be
hand
over
to
elliott
or
a
nominee
but
suddenly
it
create
a
tension
that
blew
the
whole
thing
up
it
be
the
squeeze
of
the
orange
that
get
the
pip
the
showdown
meeting
between
elliott
and

each
man
offer
to
buy
the
other
s
hold
in
bhp
with
holmes
court
cheekily
suggest
to
elliott
at
one
point
that
a
takeover
of
elder
might
free
him
to
pursue
his
interest
in
politics
we
d
get
control
of
bhp
he
say
and
you
d
get
to
be
prime
minister
the
bhp
board
have
convene
at
the
same
time
and
when
that
meeting
broke
up
loton
telephone
elliott
to
report
that
the
director
have
approve
the

elliott
who
be
president
of
carlton
football
club
among
his
many
other
duty
go
off
to
the
football
and
watch
carlton
beat
st
kilda
by
point
holmes
court
be
an
exceptionally
difficult
person
he
say
one
day
i
be
negotiate
with
him
in
his
spring
street
apartment
near
the
windsor
hotel
we
must
have
spent
three
hour
see
if
we
could
work
something
through
and
he
say
well
i
ve
get
to
go
out
for
dinner
i
say
i
ve
get
to
do
something
too
so
we
ll
resume
at
in
the
morning
we
resume
at
and
it
be
as
though
the
previous
day
s
discussion
hadn
t
take
place
that
happen
to
me
many
time
he
d
wipe
the
slate
clean
and
start
again
the
other
thing
he
do
which
be
a
great
artform
on
his
part
be
he
use
meeting
to
glean
data
he
and
kerry
packer
be
the
best
i
ve
ever
see
at
it
packer
be
good
you
d
go
and
see
packer
and
he
d
ask
you
question
after
question
holmes
court
would
ask
you
a
question
which
you
would
answer
and
you
d
ask
him
a
question
and
he
would
sit
there
and
say
nothing
in
fact
if
you
weren
t
careful
you
d
start
talk
again
i
use
to
sit
there
there
be
ten
minute
silence
when
i
met
him
quarter
of
an
hour
silence
graeme
samuel
say
the
problem
be
the
two
of
them
could
never
reach
agreement
they
just
didn
t
trust
each
other
and
that
work
to
our
advantage
holmes
court
have
roughly
per
cent
of
the
company
elliott
also
have
around
per
cent
together
per
cent
and
neither
trust
the
other
while
bhp
trust
neither
suddenly
you
ve
get
a
very
nice
triangle
samuel
say
and
play
that
triangle
off
against
each
other
and
reach
an
ultimate
accommodation
be
what
morgan
stanley
and
macquarie
bank
have
to
do
elder
sweetheart
deal
with
bhp
have
more

by
then
however
elliott

business
but
he
didn
t
want

so
prior
to
the

conclude
in
our
favour
we
have
already
negotiate
a
purchase

when

there
we

we

tv
appearance

bhp
veteran
have
never
witness
scene
to
match
those
that
unfolded
on
monday
september
when
elliott

court
arrive
separately
at
bhp
house
secretly
they

described
the

as
a
triumph
of
common
sense
it
brings
to
an
end
a
very
wasteful
exercise
in
corporate
warfare
he
say
it
mean
that
all
the
party
the
shareholder
block
the
company
s
board
its
management
can
all
work
together
now
with
the
object
of
improve
the
company
and
i
certainly
pledge
bell
s
support
to
bring
that
about
elliott
concur
as
robert
holmes
court
say
the
aim
will
now
be
to
improve
the
performance
of
the
company
rather
than
fight
peripheral
issue
sir
james
balderstone
be
at
his
most
diplomatic
with
the
contribution
of
mr
holmes
court
and
mr
elliott
bhp
will
continue
to
generate
profit
and
growth
guide
by
an
independent
board
appoint
by
and
answerable
to

as
a
whole
there
be
no

we
want

so
in
the
end
there
be
a
stand
off
at
bhp
elliott
say
we
be
friendly
with
balderstone
and
loton
and
they
didn
t
like
holmes
court
at
all
he
come
from
the
west
so
he
be
the
aggressor
we
weren
t
geoff
heeley
found
the
whole
takeover
episode
distasteful
it
be
an
interest
era
and
a
very
stressful
era
he
say
when
something
go
on
for
three
or
four
year
it
becomes
difficult
and
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
it
s
one
of
those
issue
which
a
lot
of
us
be
very
happy
to
put
behind
us
a
lot
of
credit
go
to
brian
loton
say
john
clark
one
of
the
protection
against

to

a
viable
and
vibrant
business
brian
be
very
good
at

public
the

and
the
banker
he
be
very

few
people
could
have
do
it

others

probably
describe
it
well

i
can
only
say
that

this

the

the

however
do
not

it

the

day
on

that
it
have
to
go
he

matter
come

after
the

a
major
labour
dispute
have
broken
out
with
the
australian

within
ge
it

that
the

always
make
its
number
if
one
business
falter
the
others
be
oblige
to
make
up
the
difference
but
it
be
clear
to
welch
that
utah
s
variable
performance
would
prove
an
unacceptable
drag
on
ge
s
other
division
in

just
one

in

accord
to
brian

it
be
ed
littlefield
one
of
welch
s
large
shareholder
who
suggest
that
bhp
seem
to
be
a
natural
fit
for
utah
whose
massive
open

activity
in

first
raise
the
possibility
of

with

jim
mcneill
during
a
visit
to

house
on
august
utah
wasn
t
offer
to
anybody
else
brian
loton
recall
jack
welch
and
his
people
have
decide
that
bhp
be
the
logical
buyer
and
it
would
be
worth
more
to
us
than
to
anybody
else
which
be
quite
true
as
we
shall
see
there
be
in
fact
another
prospective
buyer
reveal
here
for
the
first
time
burlingame
value
all
of
utah
s
asset
at
a
colossal
us
billion
which
be
actually
half
a
billion
dollar
more
than
bhp
s
capital
value
at
that
time
nevertheless
bhp
s
director
decide
at
a
board
meeting
on
september
to
enter
into
negotiation
with
ge
a
decision
that
marked
the
turn
point
in
the
big
australian
s
modern
history
the
director
accepted
that
if
they
didn
t
buy
utah
bhp
would
revert
to
be
a
company
with
falter
steelworks
and
an
age
oilfield
in
bass
strait
a
company
that
be
primarily
dependent
on
one
country
japan
for
most
of
its
revenue
brian
loton
s
vision
of
the
utah
acquisition
be
that
it
should
be
use
to
expand
the
company
overseas
say
john
prescott
then
general
manager
of
bhp
transport
although
the
principal
asset
ge
be
offering
be
the
coal
mine
in
queensland
brian
saw
that
utah
should
be
use
to
diversify
bhp
out
of
australia
because
bhp
be
outgrow
its
australian
market
steel
be
much
more
stagnant
than
it
have
previously
be
the
heyday
have
go
there
be
a
labor
party
in
office
in
canberra
and
after
the
early
experience
of
a
labor
government
in
the
early
s
nobody
be
quite
sure
just
how
socialist
they
d
be
and
how
much
control
they
d
try
and
exercise
it
turn
out
they
didn
t
but
we
didn
t
know
that
when
we
be
acquire
utah
but
brian
have
this
vision
and
he
manage
to
implement
it
utah

profit
from
its
queensland

soar
from

it

up
by

follow
the

no

ever

so
much
money
at
the

seat
on
the
board
with
the
title
of
chief
general
manager
of
bhp
mineral
they
want
jerry
elli
to
get
some
experience
on
the
mining
side
so
we
put
him
into
the
slot
as
my
deputy
i
be
spending
half
the
time
in
melbourne
and
half
in
san
francisco
we
have
a
house
in
south
yarra
next
to
the
botanic
garden
and
a
house
in
california
we
d
move
down
there
for
a
month
and
then
go
back
to
the
state
i
have
an
office
in
bhp
house
i
didn
t
have
much
staff
at
all
mostly
people
reporting
to
me
who
be
in
charge
of
big
operation
everywhere
so
my
job
be
to
make
sure
everything
be
run
as
it
should
incredibly
the
utah
holding
contribute
almost
per
cent
of
broken
hill
s
profit
in
the
first
full
year
under
its
new
owner
mostly
from
the
queensland
coal
mine
and
those
in
new
mexico
at
the
navajo
indian
reservation
which
supply
two
non
bhp
coal
fire
power
plant
the
acquisition
have
also
brought
some
risk
utah
own
gold
and
coal
deposit
in
politically
explosive
south
africa
as
well
as
the
escondida
copper
holding
in
strife
torn
chile
say
geoff
heeley
who
be
closely
involve
in
the
utah
transaction
when
i
join
the
company
in
we
have
steelworks
at
newcastle
port
kembla
and
whyalla
we
have
some
iron
ore
mine
in
south
australia
and
we
have
the
iron
ore
deposit
in
yampi
sound
i
don
t
think
we
d
even
open
koolyanobbing
at
that
stage
and
we
have
coal
mine
in
newcastle
and
port
kembla
we
have
limestone
quarry
in
south
australia
and
new
south
wale
and
manganese
ore
in
groote
island
but
basically
it
be
a
steel
company
when
we
acquire
utah
it
be
a
very
substantial
organisation
it
include
coal
mine
in
the
four
corner
in
the
us
it
include
the
escondida
deposit
at
that
stage
it
be
only
a
know
deposit
it
wasn
t
be
mine
coal
mine
in
queensland
and
a
whole
stack
of
other
asset
it
be
a
very
major
acquisition
and
it
be
a
roar
success
news
of
the
utah
deal
attract
the
keen
eye
of
bob
wilson
a
young
londoner
work
as
a
strategist
for
rio
tinto
zinc
rtz
he
say
to
his
chief
executive
sir
alistair
frame
bhp
do
really
well
to
get
themselves
into
a
bilateral
position
on
that
transaction
oh
frame
reply
i
never
mention
it
but
actually
ge
ask
me
if
we
d
be
interested
and
i
say
no
it
s
too
big
you
can
t
have
do
that
wilson
laugh
heartily
at
the
memory
but
still
find
it
incredible
i
can
see
if
he
be
just
look
at
we
ve
get
to
buy
all
of
it
or
nothing
then
he
might
have
come
to
a
snap
decision
he
say
but
you
ve
get
to
be
a
little
more
creative
than
that
there
be
several
way
of
try
to
do
thing
maybe
a
joint
venture
or
agree
with
bhp
or
someone
on
a
split
of
asset
i
be
probably
a
bit
rude
at
the
time
wilson
be
work
on
a
copper
project
in
panama
that
be
be
tout
as
the
best
undeveloped
copper
prospect
in
the
world
when
word
reach
him
about
escondida
it
seem
to
him
that
the
part
of
utah
that
bhp
have
in
mind
the
real
target
for
them
be
the
queensland
coal
mine
as
ge
have
place
no
value
on
escondida
in
the
transaction
because
of
the
vast
expense
of
opening
it
up
wilson
thought
he
might
still
be
able
to
snaffle
it
from
under
bhp
s
nose
he
suggest
to
alistair
frame
why
don
t
you
send
a
note
to
brian
loton
and
say
that
i
happen
to
be
passing
through
melbourne
and
would
like
to
talk
about
whether
there
might
be
one
or
two
thing
in
utah
that
they
re
not
really
interested
in
frame
comply
and
after
a
brief
meeting
with
brian
loton
wilson
be
siphon
off
to
meet
david
adam
and
bill
hunter
i
ll
do
you
a
favour
the
visitor
told
them
there
s
a
bit
of
stuff
you
picked
up
down
there
in
chile
not
a
very
nice
place
anyway
would
you
like
me
to
take
it
off
your
hand
we
don
t
know
what
we
ve
get
yet
the
bhp
men
counter
we
don
t
know
how
we
re
go
to
manage
it
thanks
for
come
and
talk
we
ll
call
you
back
sometime
wilson
go
away
empty
hand
then
but
he
would
be
back
he
knew
from
his
experience
in
the
copper
industry
that
escondida
contain
a
massive
lode
of
copper
and
he
and
indeed
bhp
would
reap
a
rich
harvest

which
in
the
chilean
view
be
not
consider
very
high
it
be
so
hot
and
dry
that
the
prospector
hung
their
tent
with
picture
of

river
to
remind
them
what
they
look

speak
from
his
mining
office
at
rio
rico
near
the
mexican
border
in

lowell
say
the
air
be
terribly
clear
up
there
and
the
star
shine
like
little
light
bulb
it
s
a
place
where
many
astronomical
observatory
be
locate
at

you
could
walk
out
away
from
the
tent
and
it
be
totally
quiet
the
only
sound
be
the
blood
in
your

over
the
next
two

lowell
do
so
much
walk
over
rough
ground
to
check
out
significant
outcrop
that
might
indicate
the
presence
of
copper
that
his
boot
wore
out
and
he
spent
day
at
a
time
without
any
footwear
we
be
not
look
for
an
underground
mine
he
say
we
be
look
for
an
open
pit
mine
whenever
he
found
a
likely
prospect
the
crew
drill
a
row
of
boreholes
at
metre
interval
unusually
wide
space
for
exploration
but
the
type
of
ore
body
they
be
look
for
would
have
be
hard
to
miss
it
would
have
dimension
of
thousand
of
metre
one
promising
site
kilometre
south
east
of
antofagasta
have
be
stake
five
time
by
codelco
and
two
or
three
other
major
company
they
have
file
claim
on
the
property
look
at
it
carefully
decide
it
wasn
t
worth
drilling
and
drop
it
lowell
say
there
be
relatively
small
outcrop
indicate
a
porphyry
copper
system
and
the
rest
of
the
area
be
cover
with
chucha
a
powdery
surface
of
bleach
rock
one
outcrop
on
top
of
a
ridge
have
some
leach
cap
there
be
a
difference
of
opinion
about
the
significance
of
the
leach
not
least
because
it
be
in
the
middle
of
the
atacama
desert
one
of
the
driest
place
on
earth
so
where
have
the
water
come
from
there
s
a
water
table
under
all
part
of
the
desert
sometimes
metre
deep
lowell
explains
in
an
ordinary
part
of
the
world
the
water
would
come
from
rainfall
and
would
penetrate
downwards
this
water
be
rise
from
the
water
table
to
the
surface
and
in
the
process
pick
up
salt
contain
copper
mineral
i
think
i
be
probably
the
first
one
to
understand
this
process
and
that
contribute
to
the
discovery
although
i
would
have
to
admit
i
didn
t
have
a
great
deal
of
faith
in
my
conclusion
but
i
felt
it
be
well
worth
drilling
at
that
spot
dave
lowell
son
of
an
arizona
rancher
have
spent
so
much
of
his
year
in
the
outdoors
that
his
feature
seem
to
have
be
chisel
out
of

he
and
his
team
burn
the
midnight
oil
try
to
pick
a
name
for
the
claim
that
to
mislead
the
opposition
would
give
the
impression
it
have
be
stake
by
a
small
miner
lowell
suggest
call
it
san
francisco
a
commonplace
name
for
such
claim
but
donaldo
rojas
a
chilean
who
be
stake
claim
for
the
project
disagreed
no
no
a
small
miner
would
be
more
romantic
than
that
he
say
we
should
call
it
la
escondida
the
hidden
one
the
name
reflect
the
explorer
intention
of
keep
the
site
secret
from
rival
company
and
if
they
hit
paydirt
it
would
also
describe
the
hidden
jewel
they
have
found
among
the
dross
lowell
return
to
his
office
at
antofagasta
leave
the
drilling
to
his
chilean
assistant

after
five
hole
pancho
telexed
me
for
permission
to
stop
the
drilling
on
the
basis
of
negative
result
he
say
i
told
him
to
keep

at

in

we
have

and
drill
in
that

be
about
to
give
up
when
we
sunk
a
drill
hole
right
into
the
middle
of
the
escondida
deposit
jim
curry
say
it
be
very
excite
although
at
that
time
chile
be
a
questionable
place
to
do
business
only
a
decade
earlier
chile
s
foreign
own
mine
have
be
nationalise
by
the
marxist
regime
of

in

be
violently
overthrown
and
kill
in
a
right
wing

coup
lead
by

with
chile

totter
the
new

denationalise
foreign
own
mine
and
welcome
investment
from
abroad
utah
international
be
scar
to
death
that
escondida
would
be
expropriate
by
the
government
again
dave
lowell
say
most
of
us
who
be
living
in
chile
at
the
time
thought
that
be
unlikely
with
pinochet
s
government
but
the
company
be
afraid
to
invest
their
own
money
they
want
per
cent
project
finance
but
before
anything
else
could
happen
controversy
erupt
when
three
utah
employee
and
one
getty
employee
claimed
to
have
discover
escondida
none
of
these
fellow
have
even
be
to
the
escondida
project
but
as
soon
as
the
discovery
be
make
they
claimed
credit
for
it
lowell
say
they
also
shut
me
out
of
the
fun
of
participate
in
the
definition
drilling
i
be
technically
separate
from
escondida
as
soon
as
the
discovery
be
make
there
be
a
lot
of
bad
feel
at
that
point
and
to
add
insult
to
injury
they
put
their
name
on
a
monument
at
the
drill
hole
that
first
intersect
escondida
but
left
my
name
off
that
sort
of
thing
often
happens
when
an
important
discovery
be
make
in
fact
it
s
more
the
rule
than
the
exception
one
year
after
the
discovery
robert
n
hickman
be
brought
in
as
president
of
minera
escondida
hickman
have
start
with
utah
in
at
the
lucky
mac
uranium
mine
and
then
after
a

primarily
the

he
say
this
be
also
a
pretty
depressed
time
for

and
chile
wasn
t
flavour
of
the
day
as
far
as
most
people
be
concerned
because
this
be
still
almost
the
heyday
of
the
pinochet
regime
even
though
that
be
foreseeably
go
to
come
to
a
close
before
this

be
up
and

that
make
me
focus
on
try

i

them
with
the

sir

we
introduce
ourselves
along
the

that
we
don
t
want
to
go
bidding
against
you
you
ve
get
a
pre
emptive
right
we
know
that
we
don
t
imagine
you
want
to
go
for
per
cent
of
this
yourself
be
there
a
way
in
which
you
and
us
can
get
together
and
think
about
do
a
joint
venture
indeed
there
be
utah
s
parent
bhp
be
pleased
to
share
the
cost
of

we
end
up
arrange
a
consortium
to
buy
texaco
s
hold
bob
hickman
say
we
initially
held
per
cent
rtz
get
per
cent
and
a
japanese
consortium
lead
by
mitsubishi
held
ten
per
cent
to
entice
the
world
bank
into
the
thing
we
give
the
idc
international
development
corporation
the
private
investment
arm
of
the
world
bank
an
option
to
buy
up
to
five
per
cent
of
our
per
cent
share
and
they
ultimately
bought
per
cent
they
also
put
up
some
fund
we
make
those
arrangement
on
october
my
th
birthday
so
bhp
now
found
itself
with
a
per
cent
interest
in
escondida
just
over
a
year
later
the
bhp
gulfstream
head
across
the

with
brian

as
we

see
have
join

refuel
on

and
then
go
into
santiago
graeme
mcgregor
recall
we
have
a
look
at
escondida
and
held
discussion
in
santiago
about
the
chilean
economy
pinochet
be
still
in
power
and
it
be
a
pretty
close
economy
in
many
way
it
be
a
gutsy
decision
to
invest
there
jim
curry
found
holmes
court
aloof
and
arrogant
he
have
all
sort
of
strange
idea
that
we
should
sell
off
the
chilean
copper
operation
because
they
weren
t
any
good
bob
hickman
however
say
that
after
a
visit
to
the
copper
field
in
northern
chile
holmes
court
change
his
mind
we
do
a
job
on
holmes
court
he
say
he
brought
his
wife
and
his
daughter
his
wife
be
a
very
able
person
none
of
them
have
ever
be
to
south
america
before
we
take
holmes
court
to
northern
chile
but
before
we
take
him
to
escondida
we
take
him
to
chuquicamata
one
of
the
big
industrial
enterprise
in
the
world
he
could
see
it
be
as
big
as
any
industrial
enterprise
in
australia
and
he
could
see
escondida
might
be
important
but
he
never
understood
how
good
escondida
be
until
he
first
look
at
chuquicamata
which
have
be
operating
at
that
time
for
year
and
be
get
down
to
its
basic
ore
body
they
laid
out
these
big
cross
section
so
he
could
see
where
these
tremendous
ore
body
have
be
and
how
they
d
mine
them
then
we
go
to
escondida
and
we
take
out
the
cross
section
we
have
for
escondida
and
they
look
just
like
chuquicamata
when
it
be
brand
new
holmes
court
who
be
our
big
critic
become
a
fan
of
escondida
when
he
go
back
to
australia
he
drop
his
opposition
he
be
a
horse
race
fan
and
he
name
one
of
his
horse
escondida
in
bhp
and
utah
formalise
their
alliance
with
the
creation
of

thus
become
one
of
the
large

with
major
operation
in
japan
europe
the
united
state
and
south
america
there
remain
the
business
of
robert

and
john
elliott
to
tidy
up
graeme
mcgregor
found
holmes
court
a
particularly
difficult
proposition
he
be
a
poker
player
but
he
be
also
a
man
of
very
fix
view
mcgregor
say
some
of
his
idea
i
didn
t
agree
with
and
argue
strongly
with
him
at
finance
committee
meeting
because
i
didn
t
like
the
potential
outcome
of
some
of
the
thing
he
be
propose
it
s
no
secret
he
want
to
break
the
company
up
not
only
that
but
some
of
the
other
financial
engineering
of
gear
up
certain
part
of
the
company
would
have
have
disastrous
result
despite
their
difference
brian
loton
discover
that
holmes
court
could
be
a
very
charm
person
i
have
a
trip
with
him
to
london
when
he
own
all

john

say
i
get
off
the

i
can
remember
there
be
press
everywhere
i
knew
nothing
about
it
that
sunday
night
there
have
be
a
huge
storm
in
london
a
cyclone
that
have
brought
all
the

i
get
off
the
plane
go
home
have
a
shower
and
go
to
the
office
i
thought
there
s
be
a
gross
overreaction
here
we
have
a
big
superannuation
fund
and
we
told
the
super
boy
get
into
the
market
they
do
and
it
paid
off
handsomely
holmes
court
make
it
clear
to
financial
writer
terry
mccrann
who
call
him
that
day
that
he
would
liquidate
all
his
asset
real
property
as
well
as
share
but
the
only
buyer
he
could
find
be
among
his
enemy
holmes
court
have
never
be
part
of
the
brian
burke
alan
bond
catholic
labor
mafia
mccrann
say
yet
burke
s
government
would
buy
all
his
perth
property
and
bond
his
company
bell
group
not
of
course
to
help
him
but
to
plunder
the
billion
dollar
plus
of
cash
that
be
inside
the
bell
resource
offshoot
however
what
the
medium
never
discover
at
the
time
or
subsequently
be
that
burke
have
also
reach
an
agreement
with
holmes
court
to
buy
his
entire
bhp
shareholding
the
sale
do
not
proceed
because
treasurer
paul
keating
vetoed
it
both
holmes
court
and
burke
approach
keating
separately
holmes
court
want
me
to
let
the
west
australian
government
acquire
his
interest
in
bhp
which
i
refuse
keating
say
he
d
talk
premier
burke
into
take
that
interest
up
when
burke
contact
him
keating
say
he
told
him
the
state
s
get
no
business
buying
this
burke
protest
in
vain
keating
say
he
be
most
concerned
that
if
the
company
ran
into
trouble
the
relatively
small
west
australian
community
would
have
to
bear
the
brunt
of
it
those
problem
would
come
to
my
doorstep
he
say
anyway
i
refuse
him
holmes
court
be
very
cranky
on
me
about
that
he
say
why
would
i
turn
him
burke
off
it
i
say
well
i
ve
get
the
national
interest
consideration
here
you
know
so
he
held
the
stock
holmes
court
be
attend
a
bhp
board
meeting
in
the
director
cottage
at
the
port
kembla
steelworks
when
he
receive
a
message
that
merrill
lynch
have
withdrawn
his
billion
dollar
line
of
credit
jerry
elli
who
be
manage
the
steelworks
at
the
time
say
my
wife
be
entertain
janet
holmes
court
somewhere
in
the
country
near
wollongong
so
they
be
summon
to
hurry
back
i
think
he
have
a
helicopter
on
standby
to
whisk
him
away
holmes
court
wasn
t
totally
ruin
but
he
be
go
say
john
elliott
who
be
also
present
at
the
board
meeting
we
conclude
erroneously
as
history
would
say
not
to
proceed
to
buy
bhp
ourselves
elder
could
have
bought
him
out
and
that
would
have
give
us
control
of
bhp
we
look
at
it
very
hard
we
could
have
bought
bhp
for
billion
look
at
it
now
it
s
worth
over
billion
stagger
one
of
the
thing
that
concerned
us
be
that
bhp
weren
t
in
control
of
any
of
their
pricing
the
steel
business
be
control
by
government
pricing
while
oil
iron
ore
and
coal
be
commodity
so
we
would
have
be
at
the
behest
of
economic
time
then
we
spent
a
couple
of
year
undo
thing
the
undo
of
it
in
the
end
be
that
we
form
a
hold
company
harlin
which
basically
bought
bhp
s
equity
in
us
bhp
have
indeed
sell
its
elder
share
to
harlin
holding
in
exchange
for
redeemable
preference
share
in
harlin
that
with
accrue
interest
would
amount
over
time
to
a
debt
of
more
than
billion
brian
loton
recall
it
be
a
difficult
period
obviously
and
you
can
see
it
pretty
clearly
in
retrospect
now
every
generation
have
its
difficulty
and
challenge
as
i
say
holmes
court
and
john
elliott
have
unsustainable
strategy
and
we
manage
the
business
until
reality
dawn
graeme
samuel
believe
bhp
have
a
lucky
escape
if
i
think
about
what
would
have
happen
have
the
whole
of
bhp
be
acquire
by
robert
holmes
court
in
the
context
of
what
ultimately
happen
to
john
elliott
and
elder
the
company
could
have
just
implode
an
increasingly
desperate
holmes
court
offer
his
shareholding
to
kerry
packer
who
decline
paul
keating
say
i
know
a
group
of
people
say
to
him
why
don
t
you
take
the
steel
business
you
give
bhp
the
stock
and
they
give
you
the
steel
business
i
know
the
actu
say
this
to
him
because
steel
need
a
whole
lot
of
workplace
change
to
make
it
work
the
actu
say
you
take
it
we
ll
make
it
work
but
no
he
wouldn
t
do
it
you
see
in
the
end
robert
holmes
court
wasn
t
a
business
builder
he
be
in
the
end
a
speculator
a
great
speculator
the
cleverest
one
we
ever
have
but
he
be
a
speculator
and
so
his
refusal
to
do
anything
about
the
bhp
steel
division
meant
that
he
be
lock
in
the
bhp
clockwork
of
event
and
they
have
to
clear
out
that
equity
interest
in
some
way
and
he
have
all
those
debt
to
the
bank
the
financial
meltdown
however
have
not
stop
work
on
minera
escondida
we
have
an
approve
budget
of
us
billion
and
we
do
it
for
us
million
so
we
save
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
money
bob
hickman
say
the
financing
be
all
tie
to
the
negotiation
of
acceptable
sale
contract
that
give
the
buyer
the
german
the
japanese
and
the
finn
the
upper
hand
in
negotiation
we
have
great
difficulty
make
the
sale
contract
and
we
didn
t
complete
that
until
mid
we
have
a
big
signing
ceremony
at
the
world
trade
center
in
new
york
city
then
we
start
the
construction
we
do
our
own
premine
strip
of
some
million
tonne
of
waste
in
order
to
get
to
the
ore
body
that
be
the
long
line
in
the
development
we
finish
the
job
in
month
originally
it
have
a
month
schedule
and
that
s
one
of
the
reason
we
under
ran
the
budget
dave
lowell
s
contract
give
him
a
five
per
cent
participate
interest
in
any
successful
discovery
but
at
the
last
minute
utah
demand
a
us
million
cap
on
the
value
of
the
interest
i
agree
to
it
which
be
a
mistake
on
my
part
lowell
say
i
m
quite
sure
they
would
have
agree
to
three
per
cent
instead
of
five
per
cent
and
no
cap
the
difference
for
me
would
have
be
several
billion
dollar
the
los
colorado
concentrator
start
processing
ore
in
november
and
the
first
shipment
be
log
as
sail
from
antofagasta
on
december
truth
be
bob
hickman
say
it
push
off
january
but
the
company
be
so
anxious
to
have
it
in
calendar
that
we
sign
the
document
december
by
this
time
the
geologic
fraternity
have
give
lowell
full
credit
for
discover
escondida
bhp

an
article
about
the

give
me
the

which
be

to
people
who
participate
in
the
opening
of
the

the
adjacent
zaldivar
ore
body
have
be
found
at
the
same
time
as
escondida
lowell
stake
a
claim
that
cover
half
of
that

in
i
be

lowell
say
it
add
up
to

the

however
have
be
defy
gravity
for
so
long
that
the
labor
government
have
mount
a
rescue
operation
in
the
shape
of
a
five
year
steel

plan
under
which
the

promise
to

productivity
increase
from
ton
per

per

in

some

in
we
didn
t
do
a
bad
job
on
the
steel
industry
say
john
prescott
who
take
over
as
head
of
bhp
steel
in
we
gradually
get
political
acceptance
for
an
enormous
downsize
in
steel
and
we
gradually
get
workforce
acceptance
for
the
need
to
do
it
there
be
a
huge
restructuring
many
redundancy
all
handle
voluntarily
and
massive
reinvestment
in
the
industry
to
make
what
be
left
efficient
i
inherit
a
loss
and
within
a
couple
of
year
turn
that
around
to
a
million
profit
we
d
turn
a
very
difficult
industry
into
a
profitable
industry
but
it
be
quite
clear
to
me
that
even
that
amount
wasn
t
something
one
should
be
too
happy
about
the
conclusion
one
be
left
with
be
that
this
be
not
the
best
industry
to
be
in
as
the
s
close
brian
loton
add
the
deputy
chairman
s
role
to
his
chief
executive
duty
brian
be
very
much
the
old
style
business
gentleman
a
very
determine
guy
say
lance

who
join
bhp
in
straight
out
of
the
university
of
new
south
wale
in
a
labour
relation
role
he
certainly
knew
his
stuff
he
could
be
on
the
one
hand
personable
but
on
the
other
hand
have
that
touch
of
ruthlessness
about
him
the
bottom
line
be
that
most
of
my
peer
be
very
respectful
of
brian
the

along
with

the

however
begin
unpromisingly
with
a
recession
that
follow
the
oil
price
spike
induced
by
the
first
gulf

then

loton
pass
the

my

with
arvi
parbo
be
excellent
he
s
one
of
the
great
mining
figure
prescott
say
and
my
relationship
with
brian
loton
be
also
very
good
i
wouldn
t
have
be
appoint
ceo
without
his
support
john
barry
prescott
be
born
in
sydney
on

and
educate
at
north
sydney
boy
high

and
the
university

south
wale
i
study
industrial
relation
at
university
and
join
bhp
in
at
newcastle
steelworks
he
say
there
be
distinction
in
those
day
between
commercial
trainee
and
cadet
and
i
be
a
commercial
trainee
rather
than
a
cadet
but
i
become
a
cadet
cadet
be
the
high
regard
group
lance
hockridge
say
i
met
john
the
first
day
i
join
the

at
that
time
john
be

he
happen
to
be

sydney
on
business
and
i
be
introduce
to
him
the
issue
that
be
run
in
those
day
be
all
about
industrial
relation
and
so
i
have
a
good
deal
to
do
with
john
when
he
become
general
manager
transport
i
become
his
manager
personnel
and
then
he

we
be
pretty
close
for
about
ten
year
then
he
become
executive
general
manager
steel
and
while
i
would
see
him
from
time
to
time
i
didn
t
have
much
to
do
with
him
then
the
wheel
turn
again
and
he
become
manage
director
and
while
i
didn
t
work
directly
for
him
be
part
of
the
executive
group
one
have
that
kind
of
interaction
as
though
to
emphasise
the
end
of
an
era
of
extraordinary
expansion
the
big
australian
have
outgrown
bhp

move
from
william

to
the
monolithic
bhp

at
bourke

have
predict
then
that
by
the
end
of
the
new
decade
broken
hill
proprietary
limited
would
have
be
brought

knee
and
shortly
afterwards

have
cease
to
exist
in
its

of

described
by
one

insider
as

not

its
way
down
highway
from
the
mountain
town
of
oracle
towards
the
low
san

indeed
the
two

have
every
reason
to
celebrate
the
trans

that
have
make
bhp

elli
thought
he

one
of
the
great

prize
of

neither
man

ahead
for
their

jerry
elli
be
instrumental
in
bring
in
the

in
arizona
the
little

approach
a
crossroad
among
the
grey

speckle
boulder
so
different
from
elli

rural
dorset

office
between
the

we
put

that
we
thought
be
doable

then
it
be
recommend
when
it
become
clear
it
be
something
that
should
have
be
favourable
for
the

the

it
transfer
to
melbourne
it
be
basically
do
by
jerry
himself
along
with
melbourne
staff
then
jerry
do
all
the
direct
negotiation
with
magma
it
didn
t
turn
out
to
be
a
very
successful

it

t
feel
confident
that
we
could
do
it
alone
elli

doubledealing
begin
to

sumitomo
then
start
its

and
in
june
only
two
week
after
the
birth
of
the
bhp
copper
group
sumitomo
admit
at
a

that

have
rack
up
more
than

in

for

in
and
be
release
in
july
the
revelation
drove
down
copper
price
by
as
much
as
ten
per
cent
in
london
and
new
york
a
fall
that
coincide
with
the
serious
downturn
among
the
tiger
economy
of
asia
one
of
the
big
market
for
copper
and
copper
intensive
product
such
as
electrical
wire
motor
vehicle
and
pipe
the
moment
copper
price
fell
to
the
extent
that
they
do
down
to
about
us
cent
a
pound
when
we
d
effectively
do
the
economics
on
a
dollar
a
pound
it
be
always
go
to
be
a
struggle
say
graeme
mcgregor
there
have
be
a
fair
bit
of
manipulation
by
the
sumitomo
trader
in
japan
who
have
effectively
create
a
false
market
then
there
be
oversupply
the
lme
stock
be
at
record
high
most
people
for
a
while
kept
produce
on
the
basis
that
they
weren
t
go
to
be
the
one
to
shut
down
facility
escondida
be
produce
but
not
nearly
to
the
extent
it
be
now
it
be
a
very
high
grade
mine
they
be
talk
per
cent
copper
for
a
year
mine
life
and
the
original
grade
be
very
high
so
it
be
in
a
vastly
different
situation
to
magma
which
be
or
down
in
melbourne
john
prescott
be
have
difficulty
accept
the
sudden
shift
in
bhp
s
fortune
the
operating
profit
after
tax
to
the
end
of
may
be
a
colossal
us
billion
in
bhp
s
annual
report
the
magma
acquisition
have
be
present
as
one
of
the
highlight
of
the
year
suddenly
thing
look
very
gloomy
indeed
magma
be
something
i
wasn
t
very
happy
about
john
prescott
say
speak
for
the
first
time
about
the
debacle
that
follow
the
copper
price
really
carked
it
have
be
between
and
us
cent
a
pound
probably
be
a
more
continue
figure
we
in
those
day
regard
a
dollar
a
pound
as
about
the
average
price
you
could
expect
through
the
cycle
but
at
one
stage
it
dipped
to
us
cent
the
problem
with
the
mineral
business
be
that
you
dig
the
stuff
up
and
you
eventually
run
out
of
it
bhp
have
have
the
good
fortune
over
the
year
to
have
a
number
of
deposit
that
didn
t
run
out
as
quickly
as
most
do
in
that
industry
broken
hill
last
more
than
a
hundred
year
and
be
still
go
escondida
be
a
hundred
year
asset
cannington
the
silver
mine
in
queensland
be
a
hundred
year
asset
the
iron
ore
mine
in
western
australia
be
probably
thousand
year
asset
the
world
wasn
t
grow
its
mineral
consumption
in
the
s
quite
as
rapidly
as
it
be
today
in
fact
there
have
be
stable
iron
ore
consumption
for
or
year
and
not
a
lot
in
copper
so
the
challenge
in
the
s
be
how
the
hell
do
you
grow
a
mineral
business
when
there
s
not
a
lot
of
growth
in
the
consumption
of
the
metal
the
thrust
be
to
diversify
the
mineral
we
be
seek
to
produce
and
to
diversify
some
of
the
activity
and
to
some
extent
to
go
downstream
to
create
a
market
for
our
own
mineral
that
be
enter
into
with
a
degree
of
confidence
because
we
have
have
seven
or
eight
very
successful
year
and
we
regard
ourselves
as
have
some
pretty
good
operator
but
when
the
copper
price
fell
out
of
bed
we
be
pretty
badly
hurt
we
have
just
make
a
couple
of
acquisition
that
have
look
okay
at
the
time
but
look
like
dog
by
or
we
slow
down
the
development
of
escondida
because
the
cash
flow
wasn
t
quite
as
good
as
it
have
be
then
we
have
a
couple
of
what
would
have
to
be
regard
as
strategic
error
not
least
of
which
be
the
direct
iron
plant
in
western
australia
and
then
we
have
some
problem
in
rhodesia
we
have
two
or
three
thing
bank
up
on
us
at
the
same
time
so
the
mineral
business
go
from
be
boomingly
successful
to
struggle
for
a
while
burgess
winter
s
team
at
bhp
copper
include
brad
mill
marsh
campbell
and
craig
steinke
all
of
whom
be
well
aware
of
the
special
relationship
that
have
exist
between
the
magma
management
and
its
workforce
at
the
time
of
the
acquisition
mill
a
large
athletic
bear
of
a
man
with
a
big
smile
be
the
chief
operating
officer
for
magma
they
move
me
back
on
to
the
strategy
side
of
the
combine
group
he
say
in
an
interview
in
the
chief

s
office
of
lonmin
the
former
lonrho
mining
empire
overlook
the

of
buckingham
palace
the
magma
executive
have
two
year
golden
handcuff
it
be
part
of
the
way
that
magma
compensation
be
set
up
and
it
be
helpful
from
a
merger
perspective
because
bhp
want
to
keep
our
people
i
spent
month
try
to
sort
out
strategy
issue
inside
bhp
but
i
become
quite
disenchant
i
really
didn
t
like
anything
to
do
with
bhp
i
thought
it
be
amateur
hour
magma
be
a
company
that
have
mediocre
asset
and
be
very
well
run
and
bhp
be
a
company
that
have
extraordinary
asset
mediocrely
run
bhp
people
in
charge
of
the
magma
asset
be
a
complete
disaster
they
manage
to
destroy
a
lot
of
value
and
in
the
process
destroy
some
career
it
be
ugly
matt
foraker
say
magma
have
a
rule
you
weren
t
allow
to
dress
too
nice
because
it
create
an
air
of
i
m
well
than
you
so
at
magma
you
weren
t
even
allow
to
wear
a
tie
but
bhp
change
all
that
we
have
the
best
union
management
in
the
world
we
have
teamwork
we
have
a
voice
and
people
be
wonder
be
bhp
go
to
destroy
this
burgess
winter
be
one
of
the
first
resignation
i
don
t
think
he
last
a
year
john
champagne
and
the
magma
metal
controller
craig
steinke
the
great
guy
who
hire
me
all
resign
they
saw
the
write
on
the
wall
john
j
o
connor
an
outspoken
dubliner
appoint
head
of
bhp
petroleum
in
take
a
particular
interest
in
burgess
winter
s
departure
he
make
it
very
clear
he
want
out
of
the
subsequent
marriage
o
connor
say
when
john
prescott
would
have
these
thousand
man
offsite
leadership
meeting
burgess
would
sit
up
on
the
stage
with
him
reading
the
newspaper
he
be
clearly
try
to
get
bought
out
which
be
i
m
sure
what
happen
burgess
winter
create
himself
a
heck
of
a
good
deal
by
sell
magma
to
bhp
say
gary
dillard
editor
of
pay
dirt
magazine
base
in
bisbee
arizona
he
have
a
good
chunk
of
the
stock
and
he
also
get
severance
pay
as
chief
executive
when
you
look
at
what
magma
have
as
asset
bhp
certainly
overpaid
one
additional
problem
be
that
bob
hickman
an
american
and
glen
andrew
a
canadian
both
competent
ex
utah
operative
be
no
longer
there
bob
left
almost
immediately
after
the
acquisition
and
glen
only
stayed
maybe
another
year
brad
mill
say
when
burgess
winter
left
they
employ

the

that

it

the

there

in

lance
hockridge
say
labour
relation
be
an
issue

the
reality
be
that

the
reason
why
the

there
be
little
consolation

that

then
when

they
wouldn

he

this
your

they

the

you
have
to

it
yourself
that
he

be
the
situation
his

found
itself
in

it

that
they
be
more
than
happy
to
fight
the

but
if
so
they
totally
misread
the

the
publicity
surround
the
incendiary
legal

it
inside

slater
gordon
have
secure
the

of

whose

cause
his

become
a

in

bhp

because
the

be
subsistence
dweller
who
do
not
use

as
a

of

theirs
be

a

accordingly

no
economic

hence
no
monetary
damage
could
be
award
burnside
respond
the
reason
economic
loss
case
involve
money
be
because
money
be
what
we
use
for
our
economy
the
lifestyle
of
the
papua
new
guinea
native
in
gathering
food
fishing
and
hunt
game
and
use
it
to
eat

be
no
less
an
economic
activity
because
it
be
not
translate
through
the
medium
of
money
the
judge
agree
bhp
then
challenged
the
jurisdiction
of
the
supreme
court
of
victoria
and
attempt
to
settle
the
claim
directly
with
the
local
landowner
this
too
be
unsuccessful
the
company
work
with
the
png
government
to
develop
legislation
that
would
prohibit
legal
proceeding
or
give
evidence
in
legal
proceeding
but
it
didn
t
end
there
john
gordon
say
in
the
event
that
bhp
and
otml
be
order
to
build
a

dam
they
would
be
entitle
to
reduce
any
compensation
payable
dollar
for
dollar
give
that
the
cost
of
a
tailing
dam
would
far
exceed
the
total
amount
of
compensation
payable
over
the
life
of
the
mine
this
would
effectively
end
all
payment
of

but
then
in
an
extraordinary
provision
the

provide
that
even
if
a
tailing
dam
be
order
and
bhp
otml
reduce
their
compensation
commitment
accordingly
they
could
elect
apparently
in
their
absolute
discretion
not
to
proceed
with
construction
of
the
dam
as
order
the
bill
enshrine
the

incorporate
draconian
punishment
for
anyone

it

of
k
plus

the

continued
as
if
all
that
be
not
enough
gordon
say
the
agreement
then
provide
that
if
someone
be
able
to
successfully
obtain
a
judgment
for
damage
against

otml
bhp
could
then
sue

the

no

at

it

so
we

he
secure

them
down
we
accepted

we
acquire
per

a
hundred
block
and
that
be
really
the
key
transformational
event
we
take
a
risk
we
step
out
from

in
an

be
very
sparse
that
s
how
bhp
have
end
up
with
this
per
cent
equity
it
be
through
that
deal
with
bp
o
connor
then
hire
norman
davidson
kelly
a
londonbased
oil
executive
to
act
as
a
rove
diplomat
for
bhp
petroleum
he
be
the
head
of
business
development
and
he
have
a
good
track
record
o
connor
say
he
have
do
deal
in
north
america
and
knew
his
way
round
international
merger
and
acquisition
i
felt
that
bhp
petroleum
need
to
be
shaken
up
need
new
blood
need
people
with
a
more
broad
base
view
the
whole
point
be
try
to
change
the
strategic
direction
of
the
business
try
to
be
a
bit
more
worldly
wise
and
try
to
find
some
new
thing
o
connor
s
strategy
be
applaud
by
don
argus
john
o
connor
actually
broke
the
bhp
cultural
mould
he
say
john
be
one
of
these
guy
that
actually
challenged
the
strategic

of
the

however
his
challenge
be
not
an
unalloyed
success
and
his
hire
of
davidson
kelly
know
to
his
friend

that

the

the

harley

and
to
assist
with
research
aspect
of
some
of
the
option
on
mr
davidson
kelly
s
behalf
he
also
spoke
with
charles
stott
at
awb
on
september
davidson
kelly
and
harley
sent
a
joint
memo
to
o
connor
recommend
that
us
million
be
spent
to
purchase
a
letter
of
credit
loc
to
be
issue
or
back
by
the
central
bank
of
iraq
in
favour
of
the
australian
wheat
board
the
loc
would
be
redeemable
into
either
oil
or
cash
no
later
than
and
bear
an
interest
rate
of
ten
per
cent
per
annum
the
memo
say
this
transaction
will
cause
the
australian
wheat
board
to
ship
about
tonne
of
wheat
to
iraq
the
purpose
of
the
transaction
be
to
establish
favour
with
the
government
of
iraq
in
anticipation
that
sometime
prior
to
the
loc
may
be
exchange
with
the
government
of
iraq
as
a
down
payment
for
entry
to
the
hcf
halfaya
concession
however
no
certainty
exists
in
this
respect
the
transaction
complies
with
the
term
of
the
un
embargo
on
iraq
because
the
awb
have
an
exemption
for
this
wheat
sale
and
our
arrangement
be
a
back
to
back
financial
agreement
the
loc
will
only
be
settle
in
oil
if
the
embargo
have
be
lift
the
most
significant
risk
take
with
this
proposal
be
that
a
new
regime
take
control
in
iraq
that
will
not
honour
obligation
the
value
of
the
loc
will
have
to
be
assess
annually
and
any
diminution
will
be
write
off
against
profit
the
bad
case
be
that
the
us
million
will
have
to
be
write
off
completely
in
which
case
it
will
be
deductible
against
income
john
o
connor
make
light
of
the
cost
say
it
represent
about
half
the
cost
of
drilling
one
dry
hole
in
the
search
for

express
reservation
about
the
deal
on
october
harley
pen
an
internal
note
on
the
situation
it
be
unclear
he
say
what
prescott
s
objection
be
but
two
possible
cause
be
the
payment
of
fund
by
the
company
for
goodwill
to
the
iraqi
government
be
akin
to
some
form
of
bribe
or
opening
the
company
to
the
allegation
that
it
be
aid
an
international
pariah
however

field
and
the

be
await
the
next
round
of
discussion
where
more
progress
be
expect
to
be
make
emphasis
add
since
the
successful
shipment
in
january
ndk
have
envision
a
series
of
subsequent
wheat
sponsorship
to
the
increasingly
desperate
iraqi
under
the
sanction
regime
indeed
charles
stott
left
his
position
at
the
awb
in
early
to
join
bhp
petroleum
as
international
business
development
manager
reporting
to
davidson
kelly
however
the
attitude
of
dfat
to
far
shipment
soon
become
a
complicate
factor
in
april
when
stott
have
join
bhp
he
sent
an
email
to
ndk
and
tom
harley
that
raise
hope
for
dfat
approval
however
they
be
dash
the
follow
month
when
harley
receive
a
fax
from
dfat
s
assistant
secretary
mark
pierce
provide
a
substantive
reply
to
the
issue
minister
have
decide
not
to
endorse
the
proposal
that
some
wheat
be
ship
against
payment
by
a
five
year
letter
of
credit
pierce
write
and
they
therefore
decide
that
no
submission
contain
any
such
proposal
should
be
put
to
the
un
sanction
committee
pierce
also
note
that
harley
s
colleague
have
raise
the
possibility
of
re
formulate
the
us
million
shipment
to
become
a
loan
rather
than
a
gift
the
department
take
the
view
that
if
the
gift
arrangement
be
re
formulate
into
a
credit
arrangement
the
requirement
of
notification
and
disclosure
to
the
unsc
sanction
committee
would
not
have
be
met
he
say
this
would
not
be
acceptable
procedure
as
far
as
the
department
be
concerned
the
sale
in
january
be
a
close
matter
and
must
remain
close

we

think
about

need
to

appropriately
warm
up

if

yes
the

thursday
tho
harley
told
the
cole
inquiry
i
believe
my
reference
to
the

thursday
be
a
reference
to
have
lunch
in
london
on
the
follow
thursday
which
be
may
however
he
would
not

to

i
don
t
know
how
familiar
you
be
with
the
detail
but
there
be
the
strong
possibility
that
the
iraqi
s
sic
will
owe
bhpp
bhp
petroleum
a
total
of
around
us
million
under
a

which
crystallises
in
month
time
i
would
prefer
to
fill
you
in
in
person
or
tom
can
easily
do
that
i
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
for
tom
and
me
to
work
through
the
issue
with
jim
lyon
and
charles
stott
who
be
involve
in
the
original
transaction
it
be
quite
complex
as
there
be
dfat
and
un
issue
to
address
we
could
then
discus
with
you
a
recommendation
either
to
proceed
to
attempt
recovery
with
a
draft
plan
of
action
or
a
recommendation
that
we
drop
the
whole
thing
i
would
be
reluctant
to
recommend
the
latter
course
of
action
without
at
least
an
internal
review
as
there
be
a
lot
of
potential
cash
at
stake
no

any
other
aspect
of

he
fought
a
valiant
but
largely
futile
battle
to
safeguard

the

that
the

loudon
s
successor
as

sir

later
described
the
acquisition
as
very
much
a
dutchrun
venture
they
make
a
very
good
case
for
do
it
and
we
say
yes
fine
and
more
or
less
told
them
to
go
ahead
and
get
on
with
it
in

terrify
that

be
go
to
take
them
over
paul
everard
say
but
billiton
be
see
as
a
good
first
step
and
it
be
partly
that
mindset
that
lead
them
to
billiton
rather
than
rio
it
fit
in
quite
well
with

profile
dave

a
young
englishman
who
become
a
billiton

in
provide
a
slightly
different
slant
billiton
have
get
into
trouble
he
say
and
i
understand
shell
have
be
told
to
buy
it
by
the
dutch
government
in
order
to
rescue
it
otherwise
it
would
have
go
bust
after
sustain
early
loss
shell
sell
off
all
of
billiton
s
non

and
reduce
its

again
and
again
billiton
have
to
fit
into
the
shell
structure
but
nobody
in
shell
knew
anything
about
metal
so
we
tend
to
have
a
much
high
degree
of
independence
say
everard
who
become

knew
all
about

but
at
that
moment
in
brazil
in
he
saw
that
his

would
have

he
say
so
we
start
look
around

opportunity
we
always
thought
that

the
young

have
have
a

spot
his

after

he
study
physic

at

then
join

they
post
me
to

great
stuff
for
a

he
say
at
the
time
south
africa
be
under
siege
internationally
for
its
apartheid
policy
nobody
would
sell
any

to
the

except
the
french
there
be
a

with

to
my
great
good

instead
of
be
sent
to
the

i
end
up
in
the
team
that
be
post
to
paris
to
work
on
this
missile
system
i
have
one
of
the
best
time
of
my
life
instead
of
march
up
and
down
with
a
gun
on
my
shoulder
in
south
africa
in
basic
training
i
be
in
paris
with
the
bright
light
and
they
actually
paid
us
a
very
generous
salary
i
be
able
to
save
enough
to
buy
my
first
car
i
be
in
paris
for
not
quite
a
year
and
then
go
back
and
work
with
csir
while
shell
be
acquire
billiton
in
gilbertson
married
his
fianc
e
rensche
fouche
and
accepted
a
job
offer
from
the
south
african
mining
group
johannesburg
consolidated
investment
company
jci
which
want
to
use
his
scientific
expertise
to
find
new
mineral
deposit
i
become
a
minor
expert
in
a
field
of
mathematics
call
pattern
recognition
he
say
if
you
be
in
a
fighter
plane
and
you
want
to
launch
a
missile
at
another
fighter
plane
your
missile
have
to
recognise
its
target
so
it
look
at
the
very
hot
exhaust
pipe
if
it
s
an
infra
red
guide
missile
and
it
then
go
after
that
but
if
the
sun
get
in
the
way
it
might
get
confuse
so
the
pattern
it
s
get
to
recognise
be
the
exhaust
pipe
and
not
the
sun
the
mathematics
be
fairly
advanced
when
you
move
from
my
simple
example
to
more
complex
example
i
become
a
minor
authority
in
south
africa
in
that
field
some
of
his
work
could
be
apply
to
look
for
geological
feature
jci
have
a
visionary
mining
director
call
bernard
smith
who
have
heard
of
this
technique
from
an
american
professor
and
want
to
see
whether
you
could
use
these
technique
to
discover
mineral
deposit
he
say
they
place
an
ad
and
i
think
i
be
the
only
person
in
the
country
who
understood
it
i
apply
for
the
job
and
ask
for
an
exorbitant
salary
and
a
motor
car
and
because
i
be
the
perfect
match
i
get
everything
i
ask
for
we
didn
t
find
any
mine
it
just
didn
t
work
terribly
well
in
that
application
it
be
well
try
to
put
a
missile
up
the
tail
of
a
fighter
one
of
gilbertson
s
first
project
at
jci
be
to
prospect
for
uranium
in
an
old
gold
mine
that
bernard
smith
be
keen
to
reopen
he
didn
t
succeed
in
find
any
uranium
but
be
soon
fly
around
the
wild
of
south
africa
with
the
exploration
unit
search
for
mineral
deposit
use
a
technique
call
multi
spectral
remote
sense
we
be
try
to
identify
whether
particular
vegetation
or
rock
have
signature
which
would
indicate
gossans
for
example
which
would
indicate
there
be
copper
down
below
he
say
this
be
become
a
very
topical
area
of
research
and
nasa
launch
what
be
call
the
earth
resource
technology
satellite
no
which
flew
around
with
scanner
image
like
a
television
set
but
in
very
narrow
part
of
the
spectrum
so
they
wouldn
t
look
like
picture

first
the

down
by
unbundling
demerging
around
half

and
he
d
never

i
take
that
as
a
great
compliment
key
join
the

shortly
afterwards
be
appoint

contender

surprised
to
be
chosen
he
have
be
promote
to

have
be
with

for
less
than
four
year
in
the
goldfish
bowl
world

he
be
still
regard
among
his
more
conservative
rival
at
anglo
american
and
de

as
something
of
an
upstart
nevertheless
he
found
himself
at
the
age
of
in
charge
of
a
successful
decentralise
group
with
a
solid
base
from
which
to
tackle
international
growth
one
of
his
first
act
be
to
stop
expensive
deep
level
gold
mining
which
have
reach
kilometre
in
part
of
the

they
want
to
go
down
to
four
kilometre
but
i
put
a
stop
to
that
he
say
i
want
to
expand
into
other
area
of
mining
aluminium
be
top
of
the
list
and
it
be
the
need
to
secure
supply
of
alumina
for
richards
bay
that
put
him
on
billiton
s
trail
richards
bay
have
cheap
electricity
and
very
little
industry
he
say
it
be
the
ideal
place
to
build
a
new
aluminium
smelter
but
we
need
to
raise
the
fund
he
also
need
to
locate
a
cheap
overseas
source
of
alumina
and
then
negotiate
a
low
rate
with
eskom
for
the
huge

of

need
to
smelt
it

there
be
a
problem
the

suddenly
slump
when
a
russian
glut
create
a
tsunami
of

around
the

gilbertson

the

just
broken

any

they

billiton
have
never

it
survive
the
tin

collapse
in
the
s
the
london

actually
suspend

in

it
have

that

in
common
with
jack

of

be
anxious
to

of
all
its

of

many
company
have
to
get
rid
of
certain
part
of
their
business
which
be
not
make
enough
money
john
loudon
muse
in
i
can
see
a
group
like
ours
at
a
certain
stage
say
well
we
might
as
well
sell
our
billiton
interest
mike
salamon
say
shell
have
decide
it
want
to
get
out
of
mining
but
it
want
to
do
the
right
thing
socially
particularly
in
holland
so
it
didn
t
want
to
decimate
its
mining
business
we
on
the
other
hand
want
to
get
a
global
mining
business
and
we
want
a
global
management
team
to
complement
our
management
team
we
also
want
somebody
to
bankroll
it
because
we
didn
t
have
enough
money
offshore
to
pay
for
it
gilbertson
s
main
problem
in
clinch
the
deal
and
it
seem
insurmountable
be
that
the
governor
of
the
south
african

dr
chris
stals
refuse
to
permit
gencor
to
export
fund
abroad
assume
gencor
and
shell
could
agree
on
a
price
and
shell
be
ask
for
a
hefty
us
billion
the
money
would
have
to
be
raise
offshore
a
herculean
task
for
a
newcomer
to
the
international
money
market
the
talk
have
be
progress
slowly
for
four
month
when
in

have
the
all
time
high
result
for
charter
accountancy
in
south
africa
mike

mick

he
be
a
very
young
lad

an
outstanding

critical
stage

of
its
unpopularity
davis
have

sometimes
pick
it
up
and
make
a
shovel
motion
if
someone

talk
crap
i
spent
the

of
a

on
a

sometimes
travel
to

and
back
the
same
day
then
back
the
next
day
he
say
recall
the
billiton
acquisition
in
his
london
office
a
few
step
off
the
haymarket
it
be
a
very
hectic
time
although
the
transaction
in
today
s
term
be
not
that
big
it
be
about
us
billion
in
total
south
africa
s
exchange
control
at
the
time
make
it
very
difficult
to
raise
the
money
because
we
couldn
t
use
the
gencor
balance
sheet
gencor
however
have
interest
worth
some
us
million
in

mostly
in

and
north

asset
gilbertson
have
also
found
an
ally
at
shell
in
cornelius
cor
herkstr
ter
who
have
become
chairman
of
royal
dutch
shell
s
committee
of
manage
director
the
previous
year
unlike
john
loudon
herkstr
ter
be
not
a
from
the
cradle
oil
man
he
be
an
economist
and
an
accountant
who
have
be
a
member
of
the
billiton
staff
from
until
he
be
the
most
senior
guy
around
gilbertson
say
but
he
stayed
in
the
background
and
didn
t
get
down
into
the
dirt
with
us
even
with
a
great
deal
of
goodwill
on
both
side
the
talk
drag
on
into
the
new
year
we
go
through
a
very
longwinded
process
gencor
have
no
cash
so
we
have
to
structure
the
deal
very
carefully
gilbertson
say
it
be
also
at
a
time
when
aluminium
price
be
fall
and
shell
have
make
the
fundamental
decision
to
get
out
they
try
to
run
an
auction
but
no
one
come
we
be
the
only
one
hover
around
shell
have
a
process
for
buying
or
sell
thing
almost
a
manual
you
have
to
work
your
way
through
to
make
sure
all
the
box
be
ticked
the
gencor
group
be
much
more
fluid
and
flexible
i
be
the
chairman
and
chief
executive
so
essentially
if
i
could
bring
my
two
shareholder
along
sanlam
and
rembrandt
then
i
could
settle
meanwhile
the
political
convulsion
in
south
africa
give
birth
to
the
rainbow
nation
in
the
country
s
first
universal
democratic
election
on
april
nelson
mandela
be
elect
president
he
invite
foreign
investor
to
support
south
african
industry
and
urge
south
african
company
to
expand
abroad
gilbertson
be
only
too
anxious
to
oblige
but
not
even
presidential
backing
could
alter
the
reserve
bank
s
intractability
no
one
can
appreciate
how
precariously
balance
this
whole
billiton
transaction
be
mick
davis
say
we
be
come
to
the
party
without
the
capacity
to
do
the
deal
gilbertson
acknowledges
the
help
he
receive
from
shell
after
it
discover
during
the
negotiation
that
it
actually
want
the
deal
to
go
ahead
as
part
of
its
own
restructuring
plan
this
realisation
be
his
ace
in
the
hole
when
the
gencor
team
suggest
shell
come
in
on
the
financing
side
shell
propose
a
loan
the
south
african
say
they
couldn
t
afford
it
and
after
explain
their
reserve
bank
problem
shell
put
up
us
million
in
bond
shell
come
to
the
party
that
be
the
brainchild
of
bernard
smith
mick
davis
say
he
negotiate
that
with
shell
a
very
smart
piece
of
work
on
his
part
it
give
them
a
potential
equity
participation
and
then
my
smart
move
after
raise
the
finance
be
a
year
later
buying
up
that
equity
participation
at
a
very
reasonable
price
by
now
the
purchase
price
have
be
reduce
to
us
billion
and
the
question
be
whether
davis
could
bank
the
transaction
once
again
he
tramped
through
the
banking
hall
of
europe
i
have
a
very
good
colleague
willy
murray
one
of
the
most
outstanding
people
i
ve
ever
work
with
he
s
now
treasurer
of
bhp
billiton
mick
davis
say
he
and
i
do
the
financing
it
be
tough
but
we
get
through
the
asset
we
have
to
sell
be
fall
in
value
and
it
be
knife
edge
stuff
as
to
whether
we
could
finance
it
one
of
the
french
bank
paribas
pull
out
at
the
last
minute
which
irritated
me
no
end
i
remember
see
the
then
chairman
of
paribas
three
or
four
month
later
and
his
only
explanation
for
why
they
pull
out
be
a
gallic
shrug
and
pooh
the
lead
bank
be
ubs
and
the
lead
person
there
say
to
me
you
know
mick
it
s
all
in
the
compensation
so
we
structure
a
very
expensive
tranche
of
money
to
bridge
that
gap
it
wasn
t
until
the
end
of
october
that
everything
be
in
place
gencor
put
up
us
million
in
offshore
asset
a
figure
that
rise
to
us
million
the
bank
ubs
barclays
credit
suisse
and
dresdner
contribute
us
million
of
debt
financing
and
shell
put
in
us
million
in
exchangeable
bond
which
amount
to
a
three
year
interest
free
loan
the
deal
take
effect
on
december

we

he

he

also

with

by
the
time
mandela
have
finish
speak
both
men
be
clearly
furious
it
be
with
some
difficulty
that
i
persuade
them
to
enter
the
building
for
the
rest
of
the
celebration
gilbertson
told
the
author
say
mike
salamon
we
slowly
weld
billiton
into
a
global
business
but
as
a
company
we
be
quite
clumsy
the
company
be
list
in
johannesburg
it
still
have
exchange
control
there
be
a
very
limited
array
of
thing
we
could
do
the
next
thing
be
to
get
a
global
listing
mick
davis
and
willy
murray
prepared
a
strategy
document
call
the
road
to
irian
jaya
with
the
intention
of
develop
gencor
into
an
international
company
we
have
exploration
property
almost
adjacent
to
freeport
mcmoran
s
great
copper
mine
in
irian
jaya
and
if
they
be
prospective
there
be
no
way
that
a
company
constrain
by
exchange
control
in
south
africa
could
build
a
billion
mine
there
davis
say
the
question
be
how
could
we
take
gencor
into
a
position
where
we
could
actually
build
it
we
attach
a
second
document
to
it
call
the
seven
step
to
what
we
want
to
achieve
one
of
those
step
be
to
reverse
the
company
into
another
company
offshore
between
and
we
try
three
time
to
find
company
we
could
actually
reverse
into
but
none
of
those
work
i
sat
down
muse
to
myself
i
say
well
if
we
can
t
sell
ourselves
to
somebody
we
ll
sell
ourselves
to
ourselves
why
don
t
we
list
those
former
shell
asset
and
then
use
that
company
to
buy
gencor
it
didn
t
quite
happen
that
way
because
billiton
bought
both
those
asset
and
the
gencor
asset
but
that
be
purely
for
structure
one
balmy
even
in
the
summer
of
brian
gilbertson
be
due
to
meet
jerry

at
the
melbourne

there
be
only
one
problem
qantas
have
lose
his
luggage
i
have
this
vision
of
appear
in
my
jean

to
rush
out

some
of
his
colleague
i
take
the
bill
to
qantas
the
next
day
and
they
nearly
faint
when
they
saw
what
i
d
bought
jerry
elli
recall
that
night
we
entertain
brian
gilbertson
to
dinner
at

that
be
just
mining
people
get
together
he
say
i
happen
to
have
all
of
my
team
in
melbourne
because
they
be
scatter
around
the
world
and
brian
happen
to
be
in
melbourne
or
it
might
have
be
by
arrangement
because
i
certainly
want
him
to
meet
them
gilbertson
and
his
team
spent
the
next
month
integrate
billiton

meanwhile
derek

to
have
dave

as
my
chief

he
s
a
grand
fellow
somebody
be

to

him
as

and
i
come
up
with
a
perfect
phrase
we

we
chose

the
institution
want
two
independent
british
director
i
m
one
of
them
would
you
be
interested
in
be
the
other
the
listing
of
billiton
would
be
the
first
of
the
big
mining
initial
public
offering
ipo
billiton
do
not
have
stellar
asset
but
it
have
an
outstanding
management
team
that
s
very
interest
indeed
jackson
reply
first
it
s
interest
to
have
south
african
company
come
to
london
second
it
seem
to
me
the
investment
community
have
get
mining
completely
wrong
and
that
the
share
of
these
company
be
hugely
undervalue
then
in
the
middle
of
royal
ascot
jackson
who
be
at
the
racecourse
in
his
capacity
as
chairman
of
the
bookmaker
ladbrokes
receive
a
call
to
meet
up
with
mick
davis
at
the
hilton
hotel
at
heathrow
airport
where
davis
be
catch
a
plane
back
to
south
africa
we
be
quite
close
to
the
launch
and
we
really
need
these
director
in
place
davis
say
john
be
all
dress
up
in
his
morning
coat
it
be
quite
hilarious
i
met
him
and
immediately
like
him
very
much
i
thought
he
would
be
an
outstanding
non
executive
director
jackson
be
also
impressed
it
wasn
t
a
long
conversation
but
i
take
to
mick
hugely
he
struck
me
as
be
a
very
interest
and
highly
intelligent
man
he
say
in
the
mishcon
boardroom
at
red
lion
square
the
next
thing
be
that
i
met
brian
gilbertson
via
a
videoconference
link
i
be
in
fleming
office
and
he
be
in
the
billiton
office
in
johannesburg
i
agree
to
join
the
board
and
it
go
on
from
there
cor
herkstr
ter
would
also
become
a
director
after
retire
as
president
of
royal
dutch
petroleum
and
chairman
of
the
royal
dutch
shell
group
the
follow
year
one
of
the
important
thing
in
a
london
listing
be
that
you
should
have
a
board
compose
of
director
who
have
sufficient
gravitas
and
industry
knowledge
gilbertson
say
you
can
t
just
take
some
of
your
shareholder
and
put
them
on
we
have
some
but
you
need
a
well
balance
than
that
and
cor
struck
me
as
the
ideal
director
because
he
have
be
at
the
top
of
one
of
the
world
s
great
company
and
he
be
an
international
businessman
of
stature
i
go
with
some
trepidation
to
his
office
to
ask
him
whether
he
would
be
willing
to
come
on
to
the
board
and
he
be
he
come
on
he
be
a
great
director
as
the
countdown
begin
to
d

warn
we
didn
t
think
of
it
as
a
profit
warn
and
it
wasn
t
a
profit
warn
it
be
simply
a
logical
comment
on
the
market
in
london
an
emergency
meeting
be
call
and
a
delegation
of
grim
face
banker
trooped
into
billiton
s
office
at
be
it
be
gonsalves
third
day
in
charge
of
investor
relation
i
wander
into
the
meeting
i
have
the
foresight
thank
god
to
bring
in
my
financial
pr
people
and
the
broker
who
at
least
have
some
market
gen
he
say
the
company
s
deputy
treasurer
begin
the
meeting
by
say
lady
and
gentleman
we
ve
clearly
get
a
crisis
in
respect
of
the
statement
make
yesterday
and
the
market
s
response
to
it
i
d
now
like
to
hand
over
to
marc
gonsalves
to
tell
us
what
s
go
on
i
get
home
that
day
and
say
to
my
wife
i
think
we
ve
make
a
mistake
another
of
billiton
s
problem
be
that
the
director
of
sanlam
now
at
the
forefront
of
black
economic
empowerment
in
south
africa
have
what
brian
gilbertson
describes
as
a
damascene
conversion
and
start
to
unload
their
stake
in
various
company
south
africa
have
undergone
a
sea
change
with
the
transition
from
the
old
south
africa
to
the
new
democratic
south
africa
he
say
the
institution
company
which
have
previously
see
their
role
as
be
to
control
the
south
african
economy
become
much
more
conventional
and
one
of
those
decision
be
that
as
an
insurance
company
you
shouldn
t
have
all
your
egg
in
one
basket
and
gencor
and
billiton
have
be
a
very
big
basket
for
them
the
right
thing
to
do
be
what
other
international
insurance
company
have
do
and
that
be
to
spread
your
investment
in
line
with
markowitz
portfolio
theory
so
they
make
that
transition
under
marinus
daling
who
incidentally
have
be
one
of
the
drive
force
in
the
gencor
unbundling
he
be
on
the
board
of
gencor
somewhere
at
the
top
of
sanlam
they
make
the
decision
that
they
should
reduce
their
hold
and
that
coincide
with
a
crisis
in
japan
and
south
east
asia
when
all
of
the
share
fell
off
a
cliff
when
billiton
plunge
to
gilbertson
receive
heavy
flak
from
the
suit
in
the
city
who
question
his
many
trip
back
to
south
africa
on
gencor
business
and
talk
of
him
as
be
an
absentee
landlord
we
be
criticise
quite
a
bit
in
the
press
about
how
billiton
be
the
first
south
african
company
to
come
to
london
and
look
what
a
pup
they
d
be
sell
gilbertson
say
we
actually
drop
below
and
be
head
for
p
and
this
at
a
time
when
we
have
cash
in
the
bank
of
p
all
these
great
asset
scatter
around
the
world
be
view
as
have
no
value
at
all
it
be
a
perfect
illustration
of
the
folly
of
investor
in
fall
market
we
just
couldn
t
believe
this
be
happen
in
fact
there
have
be
no
cause
for
panic
gilbertson
have
report
a
profit
of
us
million
in
billiton
s
first
financial
year
on
the
london
stock
exchange
a
per
cent
increase
over
the
us
million
exclude
exceptional
item
earn
in
the
previous
month
it
be
a
record
performance
compare
with
result
under
gencor
in
a
perverse
way
what
brian
have
signal
be
the
weakness
come
out
of
asia
follow
the
kyoto
treaty
and
all
the
rest
of
it
marc

then
they

after
the

he

brian

jerry

take

it
marked
the

for
john

have
be
one
of
the
prime
candidate
for
the

must

he

although
three

young
than
elli
at
have

on
as

and
not
look
to
the
chairman
s
position
say
a
bhp
insider
but
they
didn
t
have
a
solution
as
to
who
the
new
chairman
should
be
and
they
come
up
with
this
idea
that
they
should
put
jerry
elli
in
that
job
because
they
thought
it
be
more
appropriate
for
him
to
be
a
chairman
than
a
continue
executive
they
ask
prescott
to
accept
that
situation
which
be
somewhat
difficult
for
him
there
have
be
friction
between
elli
and
his
beleaguer
chief
executive
prior
to
elli
s
appointment
as

prescott
now
found
himself
beavering
away
at
an

of

along
that

be
an
astronomical
amount
of
money
to

when
bhp
own
a
far
richer
more
productive
copper
mine
in
the
massive
escondida
project
nor
be

the
only

the
oil
business
have
expand
dramatically
but
also
face
an
uncertain
future
because
bass

wasn
t
go
to
go
on
forever
and
the
north
west
shelf
while
it
be
a
pretty
useful
asset
to
have
in
conjunction
with
bass
strait
wasn
t
enough
to
satisfy
our
ambition
in
the
oil
and
gas
industry
john
prescott
say
we
do
a
fair
bit
of
other
exploration
in
australia
for
oil
and
gas
and
have
some
success
but
come
the
mid
s
we
be
desperately
keen
to
find
a
new
bass
strait
or
some
substitute
for
it
and
at
the
same
time
we
have
successfully
expand
our
mineral
business
we
have
seven
or
eight
consecutive
year
of
record
profit
in
mineral
iron
ore
and
copper
in
the
main
we
also
start
to
look
seriously
at
whether
we
could
shed
the
steel
industry
i
m
told
that
a
number
of
director
have
be
keen
to
get
out
of
steel
from
the
early
s
and
they
d
never
found
a
way
we
set
out
to
find
a
solution
to
that
and
at
the
same
time
to
continue
to
expand
our
mineral
and
petroleum
business
we
have
more
opportunity
to
expand
the
mineral
business
than
the
oil
and
gas
business
probably
the
best
thing
that
happen
to
help
us
with
petroleum
be
exploration
in
the
gulf
of
mexico
we
d
make
a
number
of
acquisition
in
petroleum
prior
to
that
include
the
hamilton
oil
company
they
be
useful
but
they
weren
t
a
bass
strait
we
go
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
in
a
fairly
substantial
way
in
very
deep
water
before
the
world
oil
industry
have
work
out
how
to
produce
oil
at
those
depth
company
like
shell
and
bp
and
probably
chevron
be
learn
how
to
go
into
much
much
deeper
water
and
we
have
actually
do
some
pretty
useful
work
ourselves
but
we
weren
t
a
shell
or
a
bp
in
the
oil
industry
however
we
take
that
punt
into
the
gulf
of
mexico
and
we
have
some
significant
discovery
in
conjunction
with
others
in
some
case
we
be
the
operator
in
some
case
we
weren

its

after
spending

abandon
its

meanwhile
the

still
under

command

connor
double
its

to
the

a

that
prevent

from
slip
into
the

to

the
slogan
a

by
in
july
an
edict
go
out
from

tower
that
the

s
odd
operating
unit
would
henceforth
be
judged
against
the

s
best
company
in
their
respective
industry
any
unit
that
fail
to
maintain
the
high

would
face
liquidation

although
it
seem
the
jack
welch
philosophy
of
fix
it
sell
it
or
fold
it
have
take
root
in
bhp
it
be
already
too
late
to
halt
the
haemorrhaging
we
have
three
year
of
pretty
significant
write
offs
of
a
number
of
investment
that
go
wrong
graeme
mcgregor
say
magma
be
the
major
one
then
we
have
problem
with
the
hbi
plant
at
port
hedland
the
titanium
sand
at
beenup
and
the
hartley
mine
in
zimbabwe
there
be
a
series
of
them
that
unfortunately
all
come
together
but
magma
be
the
cruellest
blow
jim
curry
the
former
head
of
bhp
mineral
become
a
director
of
newmont
magma
s
one
time
owner
after
retire
from
the
bhp
board
i
don
t
really
know
what
brought
the
company
to
the
point
that
it
have
so
much
trouble
except
that
they
make
a
couple
of
bad
decision
he
say
the
company
be
still
solid
it
have
good
people
and
good
operation
but
the
magma
thing
be
a
disaster
and
they
get
into
a
couple
of
other
investment
that
weren
t
too
good
either
one
of
the
difference
between
bhp
and
utah
be
that
bhp
do
not
do
the
level
of

or
analysis
that
we
do
utah
be
study
it
study
it
and
study
it
again
have
big
overrun
or
overpay
for
something
or
misestimate
reserve
be
thing
you
couldn
t
afford
to
do
the
recession
plague
copper
industry
just
couldn
t
shake
itself
out
of
the
doldrums
we
have
to
constrain
some
of
the
development
of
escondida
because
not
only
the
price
drop
but
world
consumption
drop
john

say
stage
ii
and
stage
iii
have
go
ahead
pretty
quickly
and
they
d
be
hugely
successful
the

have
approve
stage
iv
in
principle
but
stage
iv
didn
t
advance
quite
as
quickly
as
we
d
originally
envisage
then
in
august
three
key
executive
depart
in
the

send

or
six
million
ton
of
lump
a
year
which
we
really
want
to
do
if
we
produce
five
or
six
million
ton
of
lump
we
get
five
or
six
million
ton
of
fine
with
it
the
alternative
to
put
the
fine
on
the
ground
be
to
put
them
through
a
direct
reduction
iron
plant
we
believe
we
d
negotiate
market
for
that
direct
reduce
iron
however
the
plant
didn
t
develop
and
commission
as
well
as
have
be
envisage
it
be
an
engineering
problem
partly
because
the
engineer
change
some
of
the
technology
that
have
be
utilised
in
venezuela
there
be
some
other
difficulty
that
be
quite
unusual
in
bhp
there
be
some
concealment
of
overspend
for
which
some
people
be
remove
bhp
have
a
culture
where
that
sort
of
thing
didn
t
happen
but
these
two
thing
combine
to
make
that
project
a
very
substantial
disaster
at
the
same
time
as
the
copper
industry
be
go
south
and
there
be
a
couple
of
nasty
fatality
it
be
a
big
hit
it
be
a
project
that
have
overspent
to
hell
and
so
it
be
a
substantial
knock
to
bhp
at
the
time
prescott
s
problem
escalate
when
john
o
connor
publicly
promote
the
flotation
of
bhp
petroleum
as
a
separate
entity
on
the
stock
market
to
unlock
shareholder
value
seize
on
this
possibility
analyst
estimate
that
flotation
could
produce
up
to
billion
about
half
of
bhp
s
capitalisation
at
that
time
i
be
with
the
head
of
investor
relation
at
a
lunch
for
analyst
in
sydney
o
connor
explains
i
be
fairly
honest
in
respond
to
question
to
the
extent
i
could
but
i
be
careful
not
to
run
counter
to
the
board
the
background
be
we
have
have
a
project
project
leopard
to
evaluate
whether
or
not
it
would
have
be
well
for
bhp
to
have
float
some
or
all
of
the
petroleum
business
six
or
so
month
before
this
particular
lunch
for
about
three
month
all
the
analysis
right
up
to
christmas
have
be
very
encourage
to
the
extent
that
i
remember
john
prescott
say
to
me
this
be
great
by
the
time
the
new
year
come
in
you
ll
be
well
on
the
way
to
have
a
separate
enterprise
then
it
be
the
australian
summer
for
january
and
february
and
there
be
no
board
meeting
best
i
can
tell
and
a
sort
of
hiatus
developed
at
the
next
board
meeting
which
seem
to
me
to
be
march
of
it
be
quietly
say
that
project
leopard
be
no
longer
go
to
proceed
there
need
to
be
far
evaluation
it
wasn
t
necessarily
a
good
thing
it
just
fade
away
ran
into
the
sand
there
be
never
any
rationale
put
forward
as
to
why
it
should
not
go
ahead
but
it
be
clear
it
be
not
go
to
go
ahead
so
fine
that
be
that
i
be
ask
about
that
at
that
lunch
in
sydney
and
i
say
look
the
board
have
make
this
decision
if
i
didn
t
support
the
board
s
decision
i
d
have
to
resign
from
the
board
i
support
it
it
be
subsequently
report
that
i
have
be
critical
of
the
board
in
answer
to
some
hypothetical
or
other
maybe
i
d
say
that
it
would
be
well
if
they
have
some
petroleum
knowledge
i
didn
t
think
it
be
very
controversial
at
all
but
be
that
as
it
may
i
remember
wake
up
on
the
friday
of
that
week
i
have
a
tv
in
my
bedroom
and
the
news
be
say
second
major
thunderclap
at
bhp
dick
carter
head
of
mineral
have
be
fire
and
now
o
connor
be
criticise
the
board
rubbish
but
i
think
it
be
just
a
culmination
of
everything
the
hbi
thing
the
sack
of
dick
carter
it
be
all
do
very
quickly
and
discreetly
with
no
question
of
what
really
happen
i
try
to
explain
what
have
happen
nobody
want
to
hear
i
get
call
out
to
the
manage
director
s
office
there
be
an
opportunity
to
go
quietly
and
i
thought
okay
why
not
on
august
o
connor
be
show
the
door
for
his
temerity
jerry
elli
make
it
clear
to
investor
that
bhp
have
not
reject
spin
offs
as
a
strategy
but
do
not
believe
that
float
its
petroleum
division
would
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
group
at
that
time
unconvinced
many
shareholder
abandon
bhp
and
its
share
price
drop
by
almost
six
per
cent
to
as
we
have
see
phil
aiken
who
have
join
bhp
just
five
month
earlier
from
the
automotive
part
group
btr
nylex
step
into
o
connor
s
role
his
first
task
be
to
restore
public
confidence
in
bhp
petroleum
and
to
convince
his
disenchant
executive
to
stay
with
the
company
the
spin
of
the
whole
thing
at
the
time
be
necessary
for
elli
and
prescott
to
retain
credibility
in
the
market
so
it
be
perfectly
understandable
from
a
business
point
of
view
o
connor
say
i
thought
it
be
distasteful
but
i
m
a
big
boy
and
that
s
the
way
thing
work
they
don
t
like
anybody
fly
in
the
face
of
receive
wisdom
or
be
in
any
way
implicitly
critical
of
the
whole
thing
but
the
reality
be
that
bhp
be
a
provincial
enterprise
run
by
provincial
people
well
intentioned
people
but
simply
not
up
to
the
task
of
manage
effectively
a
global
company
this
be
not
hindsight
it
s
what
i
be
allude
to
at
the
time
the
fact
they
could
bring
in
someone
from
the
outside
world
like
me
and
have
a
significant
difference
make
to
what
be
up
to
then
a
sleepy
business
i
think
give
some
credibility
to
the
justified
criticism
of
the
way
the
business
be
be
run
it
be
an
old
boy
club
the
leadership
have
be
hand
down
from
sir
ian
mclennan
to
sir
james
mcneill
to
brian
loton
and
then
jerry
elli
it
be
like
one
hand
rub
the
other
hand
along
the
way
there
be
never
any
real
attempt
while
i
be
there
to
get
to
grip
with
the
cost
basis
of
the
corporation
the
same
cosy
companionship
pretty
much
prevail
on
the
board
it
s
interest
now
to
see
the
composition
of
the
board
because
i
be
always
concerned
that
there
be
no
other
person
who
knew
the
oil
and
gas
business
yet
we
be
project
make
a
billion
dollar
of
earnings
who
could
argue
about
oil
thing
brought
to
the
board
for
that
matter
there
weren
t
many
mining
expert
on
the
board
either
john
prescott
admits
life
become
extremely
difficult
in
february
bhp
laid
off
more
than
worker
at
its
pinto
valley
mine
in
the
miami
globe
area
of
arizona
when
the
copper
price
fell
to
us
cent
a
pound
close
to
what
it
cost
to
get
out
of
the
ground
production
at
the
ok
tedi
mine
the
company
s
low
cost
copper
producer
have
already
be
halt
since
mid
august
when
for
the
second
time
since
the
company
have
take
it
over
the
fly
river
have
fall
so
low
during
a
drought
that
it
be
impossible
to
navigate
it
seem
to
be
a
feature
of
mineral
development
that
the
weather
change
while
you
re
in
the
development
phase
prescott
say
whereas
you
would
have
expect
to
have
all
the
water
in
the
world
to
build
the
mine
we
end
up
have
to
fly
most
of
the
gear
in
even
the
price
of
oil
be
down
to
us
a
barrel
compare
with
us
early
in
while
gold
be
sell
for
just
under
us
an
ounce
compare
with
us
at
the
end
of
steel
price
be
steadier
but
asia
provide
market
for
half
of
the
output
of
bhp
steel
and
no
one
expect
demand
to
be
sustain
during
the
financial
trouble
that
have
devastate
the
tiger
economy
furthermore
south
korea
s
steel
industry
would
shortly
benefit
from
the
fall
in
the
value
of
the

brad

four
month
to
go
on
his
bhp
copper
contract
in
san
francisco
when
he
receive
a
phone
call
from

would
you
like

come
down
to
melbourne
and

the
vice
president
of

be
you
really
sure
you
want
me
to
he
say
you
know
i
don
t
really
think
a
lot
of
what
s
go
on
inside
bhp
be
the
right
stuff
there
s
a
lot
of
problem
and
a
lot
of
bad
decision
have
be
make
and
there
be
some
real
tough
issue
that
you
re
face
be
you
really
sure
you
want
me
to
come
down
and
take
that
on
there
be
a
long
pause
at
the
other
end
of
the
phone
then
prescott
reply
brad
actually
that
s
the
reason
i
want
you
to
come
you
re
one
of
the
few
people
in
the
last
two
year
who
s
really
be
tell
the
truth
about
what
the
issue
be
in
the
business
i
really
would
like
you
to
come
down
and
help
me
try
to
fix
what
s
not
work
mill
move
his
family
to
melbourne
to
a
house
on
the
beach
at
brighton
and
work
with
prescott
to
put
together
a
strategic
reorganisation
of
the
company
we
told
john
you
have
to
break
the
company
apart
you
have
to
spin
out
the
steel
business
he
say
john
agree
with
us
he
decide
to
tackle
the
board
and
propose
the
spin
out
of
the
steel
business
as
a
whole
take
the
whole
thing
out
one
of
the
thing
that
hasn
t
yet
emerge
publicly
be
that
i
recommend
the
removal
of
the
steel
company
from
the
company
s
asset
john
prescott
say
i
recommend
that
we
quit
the
steel
business
and
developed
a
scheme
to
do
that
which
solve
all
the
tax
issue
associate
with
it
that
have
plague
the
removal
of
steel
from
the
company
s
portfolio
for
about
year
we
come
up
with
a
solution
to
that
tax
problem
and
when
it
be
take
to
the
board
i
be
told
it
be
an
absolutely
brilliant
concept
a
couple
of
director
say
to
me
they
have
be
on
the
board
for
many
year
and
never
thought
they
d
find
a
solution
we
be
to
be
congratulate
on
come
up
with
that
solution
but
when
it
finally
go
to
the
board
they
didn
t
bite
the
bullet
it
be
prescott
s
last
throw
of
the
dice
when
it
come
down
to
the
final
presentation
to
the
board
say
brad
mill
where
it
be
go
or
no
go
in
term
of
the
reorganisation
of
bhp
and
splitting
the
steel
company
off
and
a
bunch
of
other
structural
issue
that
we
want
to
tackle
i
very
much
get
the
sense
from
talk
to
the
different
director
that
john
didn
t
have
the
vote
didn
t
have
the
support
john
didn
t
want
to
hear
that
he
be
confident
he
could
carry
it
they
say
to
john
your
strategy
be
fine
but
you
re
ask
us
to
tear
apart
the
company
that
you
have
built
over
the
last
seven
year
we
don
t
think
you
re
the
right
guy
to
do
this
so
we
re
go
to
make
a
change
and
you
re
leave
he
be
quite
surprised
by
that
decision
of
the
board
enmesh
in
problem
the
last
thing
john
prescott
want
to
hear
be
that
his
embattle
company
have
attract
the
attention
of
the
rapacious
south
african
at
billiton
who
have
covet
bhp
s
asset
for
some
time
mick
davis
recall
that
the
first
time
he
start
think
about
bhp
be
during
the
roadshow
for
the
flotation
of
billiton
in
it
be
on
one
of
the
flight
between
city
that
dave
munro
and
i
start
say
what
s
next
he
say
we
spoke
about
merge
with
bhp
that
be
the
first
time
we
start
think
about
that
idea
and
it
germinate
for
a
period
in
the
company
when
the
market
start
pick
up
we
look
at
it
again
and
again
from
the
billiton
perspective
we
thought
it
would
be
a
major
step
forward
into
some
world
class
asset
and
we
thought
for
bhp
perhaps
rather
arrogantly
it
would
be
a
major
step

he
could
fund
if
the

right
he
liberate
the

he
be
always

of
a
way
to
make

possible
in
march
billiton
make
the
first
serious

davis

unfortunately
that

and
an
old

who
be
no
longer
there
they
say
yes
fine
terribly

but
it
have
spectacularly
misfire
prescott
acknowledges
that
strategic
mistake
be
make
you
can
t
blame
the

you
have
to
blame
the
management
of

for
not
be
able
to
convince
the

go
in
a

he
say
i
m
not
try
to
pas
the
buck
to
the

it
be
a
difficult
period
the
stock
market
recoil
in
horror
when
bhp
report
a
whop
operating

to
the
end
of

compare
with
a
profit
of

the

and
consider
it
be
only
the
second
loss
in
bhp
s
hundred
year
plus
history
bhp
s
share

low
of
just
over
little
more
than
half

embarrassingly
bhp
lose

slip

the

to
which
there
be
some
much
small

around

it
have
developed
an
extraordinary
level
of
thing
go
wrong
brad

have
be
in

for
only
a

we
be

there
be
still
big

still
hadn

completely
clean
up

back
the

and
consume
a

as
described
in

confidence
in

in

be
there
until
when
i
become

it
be
inappropriate
that
i
be
on

at
that
stage
he

after
retire
from

i

we
re
just

it
will
be
wrap
up
this
year
but
it
just
show
how
long
it
take
to
finalise
some
of
these
matter
brad
mill
have
very
definite
idea
about
what
be
need
to
restore
confidence
in
bhp
itself
we
convince
craig
mudge
the
chief
of
human
resource
to
convince
jerry
elli
that
they
have
to
go
outside
and
do
a
full
external
search
for
the
new
chief
executive
of
bhp
he
say
it
wouldn
t
be
fair
to
shareholder
or
the
business
if
you
didn
t
look
at
who
be
available
in
the
marketplace
he
agree
to
that
it
be
a
key
decision
probably
one
of
jerry
s
best
decision
jerry
elli
saw
this
as
his
chance
to
break
from
the
old
bhp
mould
which
be
a
formula
that
no
longer
work
he
explains
all
of
us
be

it
be
the
way
we
be
brought
up
i
d
spent
year
with
the

and
be
full
of
its
traditional
way
of
do
thing
we
need
fresh
air
and
john
prescott
be
the
same
the
people
who
be
incumbent
at
that
time
in
the
s
be
essentially
insider
by
then
even
the
utah
fellow
be
insider
so
it
be
necessary
to
break
the
mould

his
erstwhile
dinner
guest
at
the

south
africa
have
very
great
mining
asset

many
of
them
tend
to
be
quite
difficult
to
mine
for
example
the
gold
be
at
deep
level
through
hard
rock
mining
and
we
always
thought
that
bhp

among
the
fine
asset
in
the

gilbertson
say
bhp
be
go
through
some
difficult
time

normally
in

circumstance
people
be
more
willing

they
might
otherwise
be
if
they
be
up
on
a

on

i
must
have
go
down
two

three
time
to
see
jerry
elli
i
remember
go
back
to
his

and
float
the
possibility
of
some
kind
of

at
one
stage
we
actually
get
fairly
close
jerry
elli
recall
that
gilbertson
be
accompany
by
james
graham
head
of
gresham
partner
the
proposal
they
put
to
me
be
essentially
to
merge

mineral
as
it
then
be
with

he

i
say
now
be

for

to
consider
that
mainly
because
our
share
price
be
in
the
doldrums
as
the
result
of
some
poor
investment
decision
we
make
in
the
mineral
business
and
so
why
don
t
you
come
back
at
another
time
it
might
have
come
as
a
surprise
to
the
harass
bhp
chairman
that
his
utterance
be
regard
with
great
respect
inside
billiton
there
be
a
quote
from
jerry
elli
which
be
a
mantra
within
billiton
that
in
the
year
of
the
new
century
the
mining
industry
would
come
to
be
dominate
by
two
or
three
large
global
player
diversified
in
term
of
their
spread
of
asset
currency
and
commodity
marc
gonsalves
say
we
believe
that
absolutely
it
be
one
of
the
article
of
faith
right
from
the
start
we
knew
we
have
to
get
billiton
to
a
position
where
through
marriage
or
takeover
we
found
ourselves
one
of
those
large
group
that
be
go
to
dominate
global
mining
the
belief
in
billiton
be
absolutely
core
that
the
era
of
small
single
plane
miner
around
the
world
be
over
we
knew
the
endgame
be
go
to
be
some
form
of
marriage
or
takeover
with
anglo
rio

american
gilbertson
be
the
man
with
a
proven
track
record
in
mining
the
headhunter
told
him
that
bhp
be
like
a
plane
fly
on
one
engine
and
he
be
the
industry
s
choice
to
fix
it
gilbertson
found
it
a
tempt
prospect
either
join
bhp
or
alternatively
take
it
over
and
he
discuss
the
matter
with
some
of
his
director
in
late
brian
told
us
privately
outside
a
board
meeting
that
bhp
be
sniff
at
him
john
jackson
say
i
thought
that
although
this
would
be
quite
tricky
if
brian
move
to
bhp
it
might
open
up
some
very
interest
possibility
for
the
future
in
fact
we
can
reveal
that
gilbertson
be
actually
offer
the
job
he
ask
his
colleague
on
the
billicom
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
about
it
should
i
take
the
offer
he
be
told
if
it
s
a
way
of
create
a
merger
between
billiton
and
bhp
then
yes
if
not
it
s
up
to
you
gilbertson
go
back
to
melbourne
and
told
bhp
he
would
be
interested
in
the
job
if
it
be
see
as
a
precursor
to
a
merger
they
couldn
t
swallow
it
say
a
billiton
source
the
reason
be
bhp
have
a
lot
of
mess
to
clear
up
and
they
didn
t
want
to
go
into
a
merger
and
let
us
do
it
it
be
not
in
the
interest
of
australian
shareholder
so
they
say
no
to
brian

compelling

from
a
financial
standpoint
i
would
have
be

to
what

others
uncomfortable

time
of
the
bhp
approach
he
be
president
of
goodyear
capital
corp
his
family
s
private
investment
company
then
in
november
he

that
paul

be
appoint
chief
executive
of
bhp
they
have
met
when
goodyear
be
at
kidder
peabody
during
the
merger
between
texas
eastern
and
panhandle
eastern
anderson
say
i
pull
up
the
name
of
everybody
who
have
be
suggest
by
the
headhunter
chip
be
make
for
the
job
his
background
be
perfect
include
his
experience
with
freeport
mcmoran
and
kidder
peabody
i
put
him
at
the
top
of
the
list
the
headhunter
call
goodyear
again
okay
we
ve
get
the
ceo
now
what
do
you
think
goodyear
flew
to
melbourne
for
an
interview
he
be
from
central
cast
when
he
walk
in
the
room
he
look
like
he
should
be
the
cfo
anderson
say
his
wife
elizabeth
get
along
with
kathy
it
wasn
t
very
hard
to
make
the
decision
it
be
mainly
hard
to
convince
him
that
he
want
to
leave
the
united
state
and
come
over
to
australia
say
brad
mill
i
interviewed
chip
to
come
down
to
work
with
us
i
be
one
of
the
interview
panel
i
like
chip
he
be
a
modern
american
finance
guy
a
confident
character
and
he
work
well
with
paul
goodyear
accepts
he
join
bhp
at
a
difficult
time
but
it
be
a
challenge
that
he
relish
i
like
restructuring
opportunity
i
like
rebuild
and
i
have
know
the
company
probably
a
lot
longer
than
paul
have
know
the
company
my
experience
cover
everything
from
oil
and
gas
and
mineral
not
steel
admittedly
but
then
you
have
that
finance
side
of
it
so
it
be
really
an
excellent
fit
in
term
of
my
background
and
interest
he
say
so
we
work
together
not
only
with
paul
but
with
don
argus
the
board
and
the
management
team
and
we
set
up
a
strategy
that
first
of
all
paul
felt
be
right
the
ship
and
bring
it
back
on
an
even
keel
to
tap
the
quality
of
the
asset
and
the
business
so
that
the
bad
decision
from
hbi
beenup
hartley
magma
didn
t
sink
the
company
those
thing
would
have
sunk
any
lesser
organisation
the
tall
softly
spoken
ivy
leaguer
say
in
the
press
release
that
marked
his
arrival
in
june
my
join
the
management
team
will
drive
a
new
era
of
value
creation
and
growth
at
bhp
there
be
some
who
might
question
that
estimation
in
the
first
two
year
the
dynamic
duo
of
anderson
and
goodyear
would
shed
job
and
billion
worth
of
asset
in
deal
one
thing
i
ve
found
be
that
no
matter
what
i
do
there
ll
be
people
who
disagree
with
it
anderson
told
the
financial
time
in
an
interview
at
that
time
this
be
certainly
true
of
his
attempt
at
graham
evans
s
suggestion
to
develop
a
mission
statement
in
the
form
of
a
company
charter
the
first
thing
graham
do
he
say
be
to
put
together
a
cross
section
of
about
people
in
the
organisation
i
give
them
the
skeleton
outline
of
what
i
want
it
to
have
a
purpose
and
some
imperative
what
be
our
value
and
how
do
we
judge
success
the
group
finally
come
up
with
a
charter
and
we
circulate
it
to
about
a
thousand
people
and
the
general
reaction
be
this
be
bullshit
this
be
something
clearly
write
by
a
committee
so
i
take
everything
we
have
and
lock
myself
in
a
room
over
a
weekend
and
hand
write
the
charter
which
be
very
similar
to
the
one
that
s
in
the
annual
report
now
it
be
a
very
useful
document

touchstone

anderson
found
a
willing
ally
in
his
compatriot
brad
mill
paul
come
out
of
the
same
school
of
business
that
i
go
to
the
stanford
school
of
business
he
be
a
pragmatic
competent
american
businessman
who
understood
the
structural
issue
and
the
strategic
issue
he
say
when
he
land
we
have
the
complete
map
for
what
need
to
happen
to
the
company
paul
picked
it
up
and
say
okay
let
s
execute
it
over
the
next
three
year
there
be
the
execution
of
that
very
substantial
corporate
turnaround
a
clean
up
plan
we
spun
the
steel
business
in
two
bit
instead
of
one
we
chopped
off
the
long
product
and
then
the
flat
product
paul
be
a
good
politician
he
take
his
board
with
him
once
that
happen
we
be
able
to
sort
out
the
foster

write
down
all
the
bad

the
hbis
and
the

clean
up
the
operating
structure
and
the

start
perform
much
much
well
in
term
of
have
the
focus
at
the
right
time
but
it
be
very
tough
on
the
corporate
culture
of
bhp
the
metric
i
often
look
back
on
if
you
look
at
the
top
hundred
executive
in
bhp
at
the
time
paul
anderson
start
of
them
left
over
the
next
three
year
so
it
be
when
the
culture
change
to
be
an
international
mining
company
as
foreshadow
the
previous
year
jerry
elli
have
depart

he
have
represent
his

as
a

and
coach
for
ten
year
indeed
as
the
only
australian
with
international
coach
qualification
he
have
consider
make
it
his
career
before
turn

nothing
however
could
prevent
the

australian
plunge

in

to
the

bad
ever
corporate
loss
paul
anderson
told
the
abc
the
good
news
be
that
while
the
financial
result
be
deplorable
and
i
use
that
word
carefully
in
part
they
reflect
the
fact
that
we
ve
take
a
number
of
difficult
but
very
necessary
step
to
provide
a
solid
foundation
for
the
future
anderson
have
also
authorise
a
makeover
of
the
company
s
image
we
be
already
prepare
to
change
the
identity
of
the

we
be
very
keen
to
move
away
from
the
big
australian
the
whole
company
rest
on
this
image
the
problem
be
that
big
meant
not
be
nimble
be
the
australian
constrain
you
in
the
state
it
be
see
as
be
quaint
but
not
global
we
have
to
position
ourselves
as
a
global
player
the
day
of
national
entity
be
passing
spencer
engage
a
local
company
to
do

down
victoria

about

so
we
take
the
bike
and
rode
down
to
port
campbell
and
back
it
be
a
great
ride
he

a
wonderful
businessman
with
a
distinguish

hockridge
say
he
be
very
focus
knew
with
a
remarkable
degree
of
precision
what
he
want
and
equally
importantly
what
he
didn
t
want
he
set
about
rebuild
the
company
out
of
what
be
to
say
the
least
very
troubled
time
in
late
june
with
copper
average
just
us

the
low
price
of
the
century
in
inflation
adjust
dollar
anderson
make
his
big
decision
so
far
he
close
the
san
manuel
mine
and
smelter
indefinitely
throw
almost
people
out
of
work
an
additional
employee
be
laid
off
elsewhere
in
arizona
and
nevada
represent
the
company
s
almost
total
withdrawal
from
the
american
copper
industry
bhp
spokesman
jay
rhodes
say
the
company
be
force
to
stop
most
production
in
the
united
state
because
it
be
unprofitable
at
such
low
price
closing
mine
and
lay
off
worker
while
unfortunate
be
hardly
unusual
in
the
industry
copper
be
a
cyclical
business
rhodes
say
it
s
be
one
where
when
the
price
increase
the
player
hold
low
grade
deposit
open
them
for
production
when
the
cycle
be
down
they
have
to
put
them
on
hold
paul
anderson
told
an
abc
news
reporter
on
june
the
spot
price
of
copper
today
be
down
another
six
seven
cent
versus
the
average
of
last
year
but
i
would
be
surprised
if
we
didn
t
see
some
movement
as
a
result
of
the
closure
of
our
south
west
property
the
effect
on
little
san
manuel
be
cataclysmic
accord
to
one
former
resident
an
entire
community
lose
its
identity
and
lifeblood
in
the
blink
of
an
eye
bhp
didn
t
pull
the
plug
on
san
manuel
because
the
ore
be
go
say
richard
ducote
of
the
arizona
daily
star
publish
in
nearby
tucson
nearly
two
billion
pound
of
copper
remains
entombed
in
the
low
reach
of
the
san
manuel
and
kalamazoo
ore
body
that
be
in
production
when
the
light
go
out
the
san
manuel
operation
have
be
shut
down
but
the
smelter
be
still
in
place
and
could
have
be
start
in
a
couple
of
month
say
dave
lowell
who
have
discover
the
kalamazoo
deposit
back
in
the
s
the
copper
price
have
to
rise
about
five
cent
san
manuel
and
kalamazoo
have
a
big
flow
of
water
and
it
be
terribly
expensive
to
keep
the
mine
so
they
make
the
decision
to
turn
the
pump
off
and
flood
the
mine
within
two
month
the
price
of
copper
have
risen
to
their
target
price
and
be
the
mine
in
operation
now
they
would
be
make
billion
of
dollar
a
year
paul
anderson
maintains
that
the
magma
operation
be
refocus
on
way
of
maximise
the
value
without
develop
the
mine
far
we
switch
over
to
an
exit
plan
to
do
some
acid
leach
of
some
of
the
ore
pile
that
be
already
there
and
get
some
copper
out
of
what
have
already
be
take
out
of
the
mine
and
we
would
see
if
we
could
find
a
home
for
the
smelter
in
a
deal
with
phelps
dodge
or
somebody
like
that
he
say
ultimately
we
get
some
leach
copper
out
but
the
smelter
there
be
a
lot
of
game
play
between
ourselves
and
our
competitor
and
they
realise
that
they
have
the
upper
hand
and
they
would
be
well
off
if
the
smelter
get
shut
it
could
have
make
sense
to
do
something
with
one
of
the
competitor
but
we
would
have
benefit
a
lot
more
than
they
would
have
and
they
realise
that
so
the
mine
be
strip
of
equipment
seal
and
allow
to
flood
the
huge
smelter
disappear
as
do
the
rod
plant
and
electrolytic
refinery
the
twin
smelter
stack
more
than
foot
tall
and
each
weigh
ton
be
demolish
by
explosive
an
event
that
provoke
a
new
wave
of
anguish
and
resentment
among
the
people
of
san
manuel
woman
wept
as
the
giant
chimney
landmark
in
so
many
facet
of
their
life
crashed
to
the
ground
in
cloud
of
brick
dust
to
many
it
seem
like
an
act
of
corporate
vandalism
there
be
three
generation
family
in
this
area
that
work
there
i
work
there
my
son
work
there
my
grandson
work
there
and
there
be
many
family
like
that
if
you
be
in
the
family
it
be
easy
to
get
a
job
there
taffy
tafoya
say
i
mean
hell
while
you
be
in
high
school
they
be
already
training
you
you
could
get
job
in
the
mine
if
you
go
look
at
that
area
now
you
re
not
go
to
believe
what
you
see
nice
roll
hill
they
plant
grass
and
smooth
out
all
the
gully
and
make
it
beautiful
it
look
like
beautiful
parkland
it
s
not
open
to
the
public
they
erase
everything
off
the
top
of
the
earth
with
the
price
of
copper
hit
us
a
pound
lance
hockridge
say
a
lot
of
it
be
timing
if
the
magma
company
have
be
bought
today
it
would
have
be
superb
but
life
as
a
manager
be
as
much
about
get
the
timing
right
as
anything
else
hockridge
be
sing
the
same
tune
as
brian
gilbertson
who
be
look
around
for
a
partner
to
consolidate
billiton
s
position
and
protect
it
from
the
predatory
lion
that
be
systematically
devour
the
weak
in
the
victor
or
victim
dismemberment
of
the
mining
industry
we
d
sort
out
billiton
and
we
want
to
take
the
next
step
mike
salamon
say
we
be
still
in
this
world
where
mining
be
bad
news
the
mining
industry
be
dead
you
need
to
be
much
more
efficient
the
way
to
do
that
be
to
take
big
business
and
merge
them
we
look
around
the
world
and
say
what
s
doable
the
list
wasn
t
very
long
you
have
the
national
champion
like
cvrd
which
you
couldn
t
do
then
you
have
anglo
american
which
would
in
a
sense
have
be
back
to
the
future
rio
tinto
a
dominant
number
one
and
then
bhp
which
be
go
through
a
lot
of
issue
but
have
a
fantastic
resource
base
in
particular
iron
ore
coke
coal
escondida
those
be
outstanding
franchise
paul
anderson
finally
met
brian
gilbertson
some
six
month
after
their
telephone

when
the

executive
ran
into
each
other
in

june
once
again
gilbertson
raise
the
question
of
a
possible
merger
we
ve
get
a
strategy
we
re
pursue
and
i
don
t
want
to
divert
the
attention
of
the
troop
anderson
told
him
we
ve
get
so
much
stuff
go
on
that
the
idea
of
even
talk
about
a
combination
or
anything
like
that
wouldn
t
be
appropriate
once
again
gilbertson
say
he
be
prepared
to
bide
his
time
one
of
brian
s
great
strength
be
a
huge
persistence
and
a
total
inability
to
know
when
he
s
be
unreasonable
and
a
complete
refusal
to
take
no
for
an
answer
dave
munro
say
he
d
approach
bhp
on
several
occasion
and
have
it
not
be
for
his
persistence

a
huge
pile
of
cv

i
do
it
deliberately
he
say
what

and
i
say
that
s
the
guy

need
he
read
it
and
of
course
it
be
marius
kloppers

but
he
didn
t
really

and
it
be
run
brilliantly
he

just
move
to
holland
and
be
do
aluminium
marketing
we
then
have
to
test
him
and
grow
him
into
this
role
brian

about

have
a
system
for
analyse
potential

and
acquisition
target
in
the
mining
and
oil
sector
once
a
month
they
update
a
bubble
chart
with
bhp
in
the
centre
and
various
target
circle
it
like
a
solar
system
with
the

go
around

relative
to

their
current

and
their

relative
to

month
by

any
particular
target
become
more
or
less
attractive
to
the
analyst
accord
to
the
change
in
these
variable
there
be
three
deal
that
be
pretty
much
always
in
play
the
western
mining
acquisition
woodside
to
acquire
the
bit
of
woodside
we
d
sell
the
first
time
round
or
billiton
brad
mill
say
and
then
the
fourth
one
which
we
always
thought
about
but
never
could
figure
out
how
to
do
anything
about
be
rio
tinto
those
four
be
always
be
work
on
in
some
fashion
from
the
sublime
to
the
ridiculous
bhp
start
talk
seriously
to
billiton
later
in
when
chip
goodyear
brad
mill
and
marcus
randolph
met
with
mick
davis
dave
munro
and
mike
salamon
we
work
through
all
the
structural
issue
work
out
the
dlc
duallisted
company
structure
work
out
the
logic
and
the
business
combination
mill
say
the
strategy
which
be
always
the
right
strategy
from
the
bhp
perspective
be
china
s
go
to
happen
we
just
want
to
build
a
storefront
in
front
of
china
it
be
a
simple
strategy
but
it
be
clearly
the
right
one
we
have
the
iron
ore
we
have
the
copper
we
have
the
coke
coal
we
didn
t
have
the
aluminium
billiton
be
a
very
good
fit
for
that
with
their
aluminium
asset
and
more
copper
asset
the
mineral
sand
be
also
fine
so
it
be
a
very
good
fit
for
the
overall
strategy
everybody
saw
the
industrial
logic
everybody
like
the
deal
mick
davis
and
i
be
the
two
principal
who
work
like
dog
on
this
thing
with
the
rest
of
the
negotiate
team
as
backer
we
get
to
the
point
where
everybody
be
happy
and
so
we
put
the
two
chief
executive
and
two
chairman
together
their
job
be
to
sprinkle
holy
water
over
all
that
we
have
do
and
then
work
out
some
of
the
social
issue
basically
who
be

be
chief

checked
into

grand
hyatt
in
collins
street
over
lunch
the
follow
day
brian
gilbertson
explain
that
he
d
be
have
discussion
with
paul
anderson
about
the
possibility
of
billiton
and
bhp
get
together
that
even
gilbertson
mick
davis
and
jackson
met
for
dinner
with
don
argus
paul
anderson
and
chip
goodyear
we
have
a
cordial
enough
dinner
jackson
say
but
you
could
see
some
tension
already
start
to
develop
between
brian
and
don
it
be
agree
that
the
follow
day
monday
november
gilbertson
would
spend
the
morning
with
don
argus
mick
davis
would
spend
it
with
chip
goodyear
and
jackson
would
spend
it
with
paul
anderson
they
would
all
then
adjourn
upstairs
for
a
sandwich
lunch
with
other
bhp
director
and
executive
this
be
absolutely
fascinate
because
we
be
already
start
to
talk
about
the
possible
merit
of
a
dual
list
company
structure
john
jackson
recall
paul
and
i
talk
a
fair
bit
about
that
and
possible
complication
but
paul
be
inquisitive
as
to
what
brian
would
bring
to
the
party
why
do
this
chap
insist
on
be
chief
executive
i
say
you
just
judge
him
for
yourself
but
my
experience
of
him
be
that
he
s
very
able
and
he
s
a
good
team
leader
towards
the
end
of
the
morning
we
all
foregather
in
don
s
office
and
again
the
conversation
focus
very
much
on
brian
s
wish
to
be
chief
executive
this
be
plainly
exercise
the
mind
of
don
argus
who
effectively
say
why
the
hell
i
remember
brian
say
it
won
t
necessarily
be
forever
i
wouldn
t
necessarily
regard
this
as
my
last
job
which
may
not
have
go
down
with
don
in
the
way
that
brian
intend
we
go
upstairs
and
have
a
very
nice
sandwich
lunch
with
very
nice
bhp
chap
who
plainly
knew
that
something
be
up
we
be
all
sniffed
at
by
these
good
australian
dog
as
the
billiton
trio
left
bhp
tower
jackson
say
to
gilbertson
you
see
that
enormous
building
i
promise
you
that
in
the
woodwork
there
be
australian
gentleman
long
dead
who
ll
come
out
of
it
to
stop
the
young
people
do
what
they
want
to
do
we
would
be
mad
to
do
this
we
will
get
eat
alive
we
be
in
the
heart
of
australia
gilbertson
recall
we
thought
there
be
the
possibility
of
a
deal
but
we
get
there
and
walk
into
a
brick
wall
it
just
didn
t
work
at
all
there
be
a
complete
misunderstand
paul
anderson
thought
the
star
weren
t
align
while
chip
goodyear
agree
there
be
never
a
meeting
of
mind
some
useful
contact
be
make
though
i
spoke
to
chip
and
we
establish
a
very
good
relationship
which
have
continued
to
this
day
mick
davis
say
don
argus
believe
that
one
of
the
obstacle
be
how
brian
gilbertson
would
be
position
in
the
new
entity
i
think
there
be
an
element
of
that
he
say
i
m
only
surmise
that
it
be
never
say
to
me
when
i
reflect
on
those
day
i
think
that
probably
be
part
of
it
because
brian
be
very
keen
to
become
the
ceo
of
the
company
and
i
think
all
we
be
offering
be
the
deputy
chairman
s
role
gilbertson
say
he
never
place
personal
ambition
before
a
good
deal
for
his
shareholder
the
chief
executive
s
job
be
never
an
issue
he
certainly
didn
t
push
it
mick
davis
say
in
fact
it
be
a
deliberate
strategy
on
our
part
that
we
wouldn
t
push
because
we
knew
that
paul
want
to
exit
so
it
be
then
just
a
matter
of
time
one
of
the
thing
paul
anderson
have
attempt
to
sort
out
be
the
troublesome
ok
tedi
copper
mine
the
company
be
face
yet
another
court
battle
this
time
over
its
failure
to
meet
the
term
of
the
settlement
no
tailing
dam
have
yet
be
erect
and
the
dredge
could
not
keep
up
with
the
waste
pour
into
the
river
from
the
mine
environmentalist
and
sociologist
from
around
the
world
have
turn
the
disaster
into
a
classic
case
study
whatever
the
return
from
the
copper
the
damage
to
bhp
s
reputation
be
incalculable
anderson
visit
the
mine
in
december
his
first
overseas
journey
since
join
the
company
it
be
a
very
impressive
engineering
feat
but
the
river
be
silt
up
and
there
be
a
possibility
it
would
become
acidic
he
say
there
be
a
lot
of
risk
with
the
way
the
mining
be
be
pursue
he
met
with
papua
new
guinea
prime
minister
bill
skate
and
told
him
they
should
consider
closing
the
mine
skate
wouldn
t
hear
of
it
it
be
the
big
employer
in
the
province
and
the
country
need
the
export
income
he
told
anderson
i
would
have
more
unrest
from
shut
it
down
than
from
environmental
issue
another
possibility
be
return
the
waste
to
the
pit
but
that
would
mean
only
per
cent
of
the
ore
could
be
mine
and
otml
s
canadian
partner
be
not
in
favour
he
could
have
sell
bhp
s
control
interest
on
the
open
market
but
a
less
responsible
miner
would
make
thing
bad
that
be
inconsistent
with
our
charter
and
with
the
way
we
want
to
run
this
company
he
say
his
solution
be
to
put
bhp
s
share
into
a
trust
on
condition
that
they
would
continue
with
the
dredge
of
the
river
and
minimise
the
environmental
damage
don
argus
say
paul
come
to
the
decision
pretty
quickly
he
s
a
man
of
great
integrity
he
saw
the
damage
and
he
go
to
the
png
government
and
say
we
can
t
continue
to
mine
like
this
then
he
come
back
and
say
we
ve
get
to
get
out
of
here
that
be
a
pretty
ballsy
sort
of
a
statement
to
come
to
a
board
and
say
we
ve
do
bad
here
we
ve
get
to
get
out
and
we
re
go
to
give
it
to
the
people
on
the
river
a
laudable
sentiment
but
much
easy
say
than
do
anderson
establish
a
group
to
negotiate
with
the
stakeholder
the
venerable
european
banking
house
rothschild
would
act
as
mediator
he
announce
on
february
that
in
order
to
cut
its
loss
bhp
have
transfer
its
per
cent
stake
in
otml
to
a
new
entity
the
png
sustainable
development
program
limited
pngsdp
incorporate
under
singapore
law
the
pngsdp
would
join
the
png
government
per
cent
and
the
canadian
inmet
mining
corporation
per
cent
as
otml
s
major
shareholder
otml
would
continue
to
operate
the
mine
but
the
new
arrangement
he
say
protects
bhp
shareholder
from
liability
arise
from
the
mine
subsequent
to
our
exit
pngsdp
would
be
chair
by
the
respect
academic
economist
and
australian
government
adviser
ross
garnaut
who
would
also
become
a
director
of
otml
its
brief
would
be
to
invest
one
third
of
its
income
from
the
mine
in
current
sustainable
development
project
in
png
and
the
remainder
in
a
long
term
fund
to
finance
project
for
up
to
year
follow
the
closure
of
the
mine
in
addition
its
funding
could
be
drawn
upon
for
otml
capital
call
contractual
obligation
include
indemnity
and
operating
expense
keith
faulkner
who
have
successfully
manage
mine
in
australia
armenia
and
south
africa
be
engage
by
otml
as
manage
director
the
place
be
well
run
well
organise
and
in
very
good
shape
he
say
i
think
the
arrangement
bhp
come
to
with
the
other
partner
be
a
good
structure
it
have
check
and
balance
to
prevent
the
misuse
of
fund
however
it
would
be
another
three
year
before
the
company
be
finally
able
to
free
itself
from
the
ok
tedi
tar
baby
and
even
then
as
we
shall
see
it
would
carry
with
it
dark
trail
of
opprobrium
from
social
scientist
and
the
international
medium
the
most
immediate
task
be
to
redress
some
of
the
malaise
that
have
crept
into
bhp
s
business
practice
in
early
anderson
and
goodyear
apply
the
markowitz
portfolio
theory
to
all
of
the
company
s
asset
and
at
the
same
time
tackle
the
touchy
question
of
whether
its
manager
should
continue
to
hedge
its
exposure
in
currency
and
commodity
traditionally
the
company
have
be
a
hedger
and
it
have
allow
that
to
occur
at
the
asset
level
which
be
insane
goodyear
say
there
be
no
way
the
individual
business
could
ass
the
impact
and
the
relationship
between
commodity
and
currency
secondly
the
management
team
which
sit
around
and
for
a
third
of
their
time
say
should
we
hedge
today
or
not
instead
of
work
on
those
thing
which
be
within
their
control
the
efficiency
of
mining
activity
where
they
should
be
mining
etc
the
third
thing
be
that
they
didn
t
even
hedge
base
on
a
view
of
the
fundamental
of
their
market
what
they
really
do
be
say
be
this
a
price
above
the
budget
i
agree
to
commit
to
at
the
begin
of
the
year
if
it
be
we
be
go
to
lock
that
price
in
and
increase
the
probability
that
we
will
meet
our
budget
when
anderson
and
goodyear
study
the
portfolio
model
and
the
cash
flow
risk
they
realise
that
while
individual
commodity
be
indeed
volatile
an
aggregation
of
bhp
s
asset
across
numerous
commodity
market
and
currency
be
actually
rock
solid
it
be
like
the
rosetta
stone
goodyear
say
it
create
the
foundation
for
the
decision
to
move
forward
there
be
operating
decision
that
need
to
be
make
but
the
financial
strategy
kick
off
those
as
well
as
numerous
other
discussion
include
get
rid
of
hedge
which
we
do
and
that
make
all
the
difference
bhp
turn
its
attention
to
rio
tinto
in
when
don
argus
and
paul
anderson
met
with
bob
wilson
in
singapore
to
try
to
merge
their
respective
iron
ore
division
it
be
quite
an
interest
meeting
in
the
context
of
the
future
of
both
the
company
because
i
be
very
conscious
of
how
rio
acquire
cra
how
they
pinch
it
and
i
think
the
cra
board
need
to
be
challenged
pretty
hard
about
how
that
transaction
be
do
argus
say
i
m
pretty
fire
about
that
there
s
a
lot
of
people
need
to
look
at
their
career
over
that
the
talk
however
founder
on
some
basic
point
bob
didn
t
like
petroleum
and
he
didn
t
like
the
hbi
plant
argus
say
and
he
didn
t
like
the
steel
division
so
it
didn
t
go
anywhere
bob
wilson
explains
i
didn
t
relish
the
idea
of
get
back
in
a
big
way
into
business
where
we
didn
t
have
long
term
sustainable
competitive
advantage
meanwhile
billiton
s
anoint
wunderkind
marius
kloppers
have
be
give
one
challenge
after
another
to
mould
him
as
gilbertson
s
successor
through
a
company
initiative
call
extract
value
from
our
business
kloppers
come
up
with
the
idea
of
consolidate
billiton
s
marketing
operation
by
create
a
commodity
trading
business
gilbertson
told
him
it
sound
like
a
good
idea
go
and
do
it
kloppers
be
put
in
charge
of
an
entity
call
b
mark
billiton
marketing
base
in
the
hague
once
again
he
do
a
brilliant
job
this
guy
be
good
gilbertson
told
ian
fraser
let
s
see
what
else
we
can
do
with
him
he
s
run
a
smelter
but
he
hasn
t
run
a
mine
what
s
our
toughest
job
the
most
troublesome
part
of
the
billiton
portfolio
be
manganese
so
kloppers
be
sent
back
to
johannesburg
to
run
samancor
and
he
do
it
well
he
d
do
smelt
and
built
a
refinery
he
d
do
marketing
and
commodity
trading
and
now
he
d
prove
that
he
be
also
an
operator
fraser
say
he
d
move
his
family
four
time
in
as
many
year
and
be
okay
with
it
this
guy
be
special
kloppers
be
still
in
south
africa
in
november
when
the
entire
acquisition
landscape
dramatically
change
after
brian
gilbertson
the
former
rocket
scientist
spot
a
heat
seek
missile
head
straight
for
him
the
dulini
game
lodge
in
the
sabi
sand
reserve
near
the
kruger
national
park
be
one
of
billiton
s
showpiece
it
have
be
bought
by
gencor
when
south
african
company
have
big
internal
cash
flow
and
be
look
for
thing
to
buy
with
them
the
lodge
built
in
the
style
of
karen
blixen
s
farm
in
africa
have
luxurious
suite
for
visitor
and
observation
platform
to
view
the
wild
animal
it
be
very
useful
because
the
first
thing
a
new
customer
would
ask
you
be
to
see
the
animal
so
you
could
be
a
gracious
host
and
give
them
a
unique
experience
gilbertson
say
we
have
add
cvrd
to
our
list
of
potential
partner
and
we
have
a
very
senior
delegation
there
i
have
to
leave
them
to
go
and
receive
some
news
about
the
anglo
american
corporation
later
that
day
marius
kloppers
and
roger
agnelli
cvrd
s
chief
executive
arrive
by
helicopter
for
a
tour
of
the
koornfontein
coal
mine
billiton
have
already
bought
a
small
stake
in
the
brazilian
company
and
it
be
thought
the
talk
of
a
merger
would
progress
over
dinner
that
even
have
shower
and
change
after
emerge
from
the
coal
mine
kloppers
be
head
towards
the
helicopter
when
gilbertson
walk
over
brian
put
a
single
piece
of
paper
in
my
hand
kloppers
say
it
be
a
fax
from
matthys
visser
who
be
the
rembrandt
director
on
the
gencor
board
brian
say
to
me
as
he
hand
me
the
piece
of
paper
i
guess
dinner
be
go
to
be
somewhat
difficult
tonight
the
fax
disclose
that
anglo
american
have
dispose
of
one
of
its
non
mining
asset
a
per
cent
stake
in
the
financial
service
group
first
rand
to
the
rembrandt
group
in
exchange
for
two
mining
asset
per
cent
of
billiton
and
per
cent
of
gold
field
as
of
that
day
anglo
be
a
seven
per
cent
stakeholder
in
billiton
gilbertson
regard
rembrandt
s
move
as
rank
betrayal
it
flew
in
the
face
of
assurance
give
over
many
year
i
be
give
an
hour
s
notice
of
the
news
he
say
anglo
end
up
with
a
substantial
hold
in
our
share
and
we
thought
that
be
the
precursor
to
a
takeover
bid
mick
davis
be
in
cape
town
about
to
start
a
vacation
with
his
family
when
gilbertson
phone
we
have
a
conversation
with
a
lot
of
pregnant
pause
davis
say
there
be
much
rage
between
us
as
to
how
these
people
could
do
it
but
it
give
us
a
thing
which
we
could
reflect
back
to
bhp
that
if
they
didn
t
act
now
they
might
not
get
the
company
at
that
time
however
anglo
american
be
intent
on
privatise
de
beer
in
which
it
have
a
large
hold
so
the
fear
takeover
bid
do
not
eventuate
in
fact
anglo
give
an
undertaking
that
it
would
not
make
a
hostile
bid
for
billiton
or
increase
its
share
to
more
than
per
cent
before
unless
another
company
make
a
bid
for
billiton
that
create
a
very
interest
situation
because
there
be
three
big
player
in
the
industry
bhp
rio
tinto
and
anglo
american
gilbertson
say
each
be
of
the
order
of
a
billion
company
while
billiton
be
just
less
than
a
billion
company
so
we
be
the
kingmaker
whoever
get
billiton
would
automatically
become
number
one
in
the
world
there
follow
an
interest
set
of
meeting
with
rio
tinto
s
chairman
bob
wilson
and
a
flirtation
with
paul
anderson
at
bhp
in
september
when
gilbertson
attend
the
sydney
olympics
as
anderson
s
guest
i
have
no
huge
aspiration
to
be
an
independent
company
or
to
be
in
control
and
run
the
thing
my
aspiration
be
to
get
the
maximum
value
for
my
shareholder
gilbertson
say
harry
oppenheimer
have
retire
and
julian
ogilvy
thompson
be
in
the
chair
at
anglo
american
i
thought
if
anglo
take
us
we
would
be
stifle
and
just
disappear
into
their
revenue
by
then
billiton
be
already
a
plc
we
d
twice
raise
money
we
d
start
acquire
thing
internationally
but
bhp
always
seem
the
natural
partner
three
month
after
the
olympics
gilbertson
and
anderson
met
again
paul
have
go
to
morocco
to
look
at
some
oil
opportunity
and
on
the
way
back
to
melbourne
for
christmas
he
say
he
d
come
through
johannesburg
gilbertson
say
i
flew
up
from
my
holiday
home
at
plettenberg
bay
and
we
met
for
an
hour
or
two
in
the
hotel
at
what
be
then
jan
smut
airport
and
essentially
agree
the
merger
i
go
back
to
plett
and
paul
flew
off
to
melbourne
and
i
write
it
in
longhand
on
a
sheet
of
paper
two
sheet
if
i
remember
correctly
faxed
it
across
to
paul
and
he
come
back
and
say
yes
he
thought
that
be
okay
as
far
as
i
be
concerned
and
as
far
as
paul
be
concerned
the
deal
be
do
without
any
lawyer
around
or
without
any
corporate
adviser
we
save
a
lot
of
money
and
when
they
come
back
from
their
vacation
in
early
january
we
say
here
s
the
deal
just
get
it
do
john
jackson
be
on
holiday
in
california
when
gilbertson
telephone
just
to
let
you
know
it
s
start
up
again
he
say
paul
and
i
have
have
a
meeting
in
cape
town
and
we
think
there
really
be
something
in
this
accord
to
marius
kloppers
thing
then
move
quickly
gilbertson
write
to
his
senior
executive
say
that
gencor
in
its
present
form
would
have
cease
to
exist
in
month
time
that
all
of
their
preparation
have
to
be
gear
towards
that
objective
he
also
appoint
investment
banker
to
analyse
the
various
option
that
be
open
to
him
and
then
in
the
new
year
summon
kloppers
and
the
rest
of
his
team
to
a
meeting
in
london
we
review
the
various
combination
that
be
possible
alcan
the
canadian
aluminium
firm
cvrd
bhp
kloppers
say
the
review
be
start
with
a
view
towards
consummate
one
of
those
transaction
in
short
order
bhp
be
the
one
that
be
most
attractive
to
the
management
team
it
be
more
upstream
than
alcan
perhaps
it
be
also
felt
that
there
be
a
precedent
in
the
rio
tinto
cra
dual
list
structure
which
probably
make
that
a
little
bit
easy
to
think
about
and
there
have
be
some
earlier
discussion
between
brian
and
paul
in
june
of
the
previous
year
gilbertson
circulate
copy
of
the
fax
to
the
billicom
group
which
now
include
marc
gonsalves
ian
fraser
and
marius
kloppers
we
all
knew
what
this
be
about
whereas
my
counterpart
at
bhp
found
out
ten
day
before
the
merger
be
announce
that
this
be
go
on
so
there
be
very
different
culture
gonsalves
say
when
i
think
back
to
that
fax
it
be
the
deal
after
that
there
be
an
intense
period
when
the
adviser
and
the
banker
come
in
and
gild
the
lily
and
refine
the
whole
thing
mick
talk
about
momentum
and
this
start
to
get
momentum
from
that
december
there
be
a
clear
business
logic
to
it
that
be
so
strong
that
it
prevail
against
the
political
sensitivity
and
the
weight
of
the
various
company
all
of
which
be
potential
deal
destroyer
those
two
month
before
the
deal
be
announce
be
a
great
deal
of
fun
paul
anderson
have
sensibly
resist
the
merger
until
the
pendulum
have
swung
in
his
favour
and
bhp
could
negotiate
from
a
position
of
strength
impossible
even
a
few
month
earlier
after
a
series
of
write
offs
the
company
have
go
from
record
the
large
corporate
loss
in
australian
history
to
post
a
record
profit
of
billion
in
the
six
month
to
december
say
brad
mill
we
d
do
all
the
work
we
d
do
all
the
evaluation
and
so
everybody
be
ready
we
knew
the
structural
issue
we
have
the
legal
documentation
finish
even
though
it
have
be
on
the
shelf
for
six
month
we
be
able
to
just
dust
it
off
it
seem
to
john
jackson
that
the
bhp
ghost
be
no
longer
go
to
be
able
to
keep
the
south
african
outsider
at
bay
the
more
one
look
at
it
from
the
point
of
view
of
billiton
the
more
attractive
it
look
he
say
but
there
be
still
some
issue
around
brian
be
insist
that
within
a
measurable
time
paul
anderson
step
down
as
chief
executive
and
he
take
up
the
position
lord
renwick
who
be
involve
in
the
merger
discussion
be
enthusiastic
about
the
prospect
the
rationale
for
the
merger
as
conceive
by
paul
anderson
and
brian
gilbertson
and
his
team
be
to
create
a
truly
global
mining
company
in
virtually
every
metal
in
virtually
every
geography
he
say
you
would
have
tremendous
diversification
of
opportunity
and
also
tremendous
diversification
of
risk
you
wouldn
t
need
to
do
hedge
for
these
various
metal
because
you
be
automatically
hedge
already
the
power
of
this
combination
would
be
hugely
effective
and
the
combination
would
throw
off
a
lot
of
cash
enable
you
to
both
develop
huge
long
term
project
and
make
far
acquisition
obviously
we
be
very
optimistic
about
metal
price
but
what
happen
exceed
our
expectation
the
billiton
merger
however
be
only
one
of
bhp
s
option
after
the
billiton
deal
fell
apart
in
november
anderson
become
serious
about
buying
western
mining
move
in
and
out
of
western
mining
share
and
talk
to
the
western
mining
corporation
wmc
board
when
the
bhp
board
met
to
decide
on
the
bhp
merger
with
billiton
director
found
themselves
look
at
two
deal
the
billiton
merger
or
the
acquisition
of
western
mining
we
give
them
an
alternative
which
one
do
they
want
to
do
brad
mill
say
we
be
prepared
to
execute
against
either
deal
come
out
of
the
board
meeting
we
felt
we
have
to
do
one
or
the
other
at
the
end
of
the
day
the
billiton
deal
create
the
big
more
excite
platform
of
the
two
we
d
have
tortuous
negotiation
with
western
it
wasn
t
go
very
well
they
be
resist
us
with
great
vigour
part
of
the
problem
be
that
we
would
have
have
to
go
hostile
they
just
wouldn
t
accept
a
friendly
deal
they
want
us
to
bid
for
the
company
we
really
didn
t
want
to
get
involve
in
a
big
auction
at
that
point
paul
felt
there
be
too
much
at
risk
and
he
d
rather
do
a
friendly
transaction
he
talk
through
the
issue
with
the
board
and
the
board
select
the
bhp
billiton
merger
the
rest
as
they
say
be
history
there
be
a
number
of
issue
that
have
to
be
gotten
through
to
make
it
work
mike
salamon
say
there
be
all
the
firb
australian
foreign
investment
review
board
issue
we
want
to
retain
both
listing
london
be
the
mining
finance
capital
of
the
world
but
in
order
to
retain
a
listing
there
we
have
to
live
by
a
whole
lot
of
stock
exchange
rule
there
be
different
accounting
interpretation
and
there
be
obviously
the
merger
ratio
all
of
that
come
together
the
next
time
brian
gilbertson
arrive
at
melbourne
s
tullamarine
airport
he
be
on
his
way

in

of

in

the
day
before
the
announcement
an
early
morning
meeting
and
very
much
a
business
meeting
we
be
give
an
opportunity
to
meet
brian
and
then
we
be
dispatch
back
to
our
respective
realm
of
operation
to
be
prepared
to
deal
with
the

and
the
repercussion
on
march
paul
anderson
publicly
reveal
plan
to
merge
bhp
with
billiton
as
dual
list
company
if
consummate
the
deal
would
create
a
diversified
mining
colossus
with
a
market
capitalisation
of
billion
bhp
shareholder
would
have
the
upper
hand
control
about
per
cent
of
the
combine
group
s
equity
compare
with
billiton
s
per
cent
a
ratio
that
despite
its
australian
bias
have
be
the
subject
of
great
controversy
in
australia
ever
since
anderson
would
serve
as
chief
executive
until
the
end
of
when
he
would
hand
over
to
brian
gilbertson
this
be
a
sensational
fit
anderson
told
the
press
the
company
balance
each
other
well
with
an
exceptional
breadth
of
asset
and
capability
which
have
take
many
year
to
develop
gilbertson
be
equally
fulsome
we
re
create
the
best
company
in
the
industry
and
i
look
forward
very
much
to
work
with
you
he
told
staff
at
an
introductory
meeting
before
head
back
to
london
we
re
go
to
do
great
thing
the
merge
company
provisionally
know
as
bhp
billiton
would
instantly
become
the
world
s
second
big
mining
and
metal
group
after
america
s
alcoa
and
would
be

on
the
australian

london

there
would
also
be
a
secondary
listing
on
the

and
an
american

be
immediate

jumped
more
than
five
per

in

touch
a

of

the
late
in
the
frenzy
of
consolidation
that
have
gripped
the
global
mining

paul

he
have
examine
every
possible
merger
combination
in
the
mining
sector
before
decide
to
link
up
with
billiton
we
be
at
a
crossroad

he

that
no
matter
how
fast
you
move
you
didn
t
move
fast
enough
indeed
the

thus
end

whether

although

expect
a

from
that
quarter
for

to
this

that
i
do
not

it
never

he

however
brad

under

rule
anglo
american
be
frozen
until
they
have
complete
everything
to
do
with
the
de
beer

we
be
able
to
sequence
the
timing
of
the
bhp
billiton
transaction
such
that
it
close
inside
that
merger
window
so
that
anglo
american
couldn
t
act
on
their
shareholding
and
couldn
t
compete
with
the

not
surprisingly
perhaps
give
the
iconic
nature
of
bhp
financial
journalist
and
some
shareholder
lambast
the

the
barbarian
weren
t
exactly
storm
the

but
a
bunch
of
south

see
climb
into

the

such
as

bhp

suckered
billiton

might
be
a

and

data
still
too
murky
the
trojan
horse
mentality
persist
when
the
australian

insist
that
the

the
key

the

critic
claimed
that
the

undervalue
whereas

the

be
assess
on
the

the

of

the
australian
club
bhp
director
be
accuse
of
metaphorically
drop
their
pant
an
allegation
that
lead
to
a
touch
of
low
humour
in
bhp
tower
when
a
bulletin
board
call
merger
update
be
rename
takeover
update
by
some
wag
and
then
alter
to
bendover
update
marc
gonsalves
say
that
be
in
that
period
when
there
be
so
much
angst
because
the
press
in
australia
be
stir
it
up
that
this
be
a
fifth
column
of
billiton
people
who
be
do
a
reverse
takeover
of
bhp
and
the
bhp
guy
be
screw
brian
gilbertson
think
the
merger
be
regard
as
a
reverse
takeover
because
most
of
his
colleague
survive
the
inevitable
cull
normally
the
victor
come
in
and
those
who
lose
the
takeover
be
put
to
the
sword
and
be
go
and
that
didn
t
happen
he
say
i
have
some
very
gift
colleague
work
with
me
mike
salamon
go
on
to
become
a
board
member
of
bhp
billiton
marius
kloppers
become
chief
executive
and
dave
munro
be
a
senior
executive
until
he
left
to
join
platinum
miner
lonmin
the
deal
be
complementary
largely
because
bhp
have
a
strong
balance
sheet
but
a
weak
range
of
project
whereas
billiton
have
lot
of
new
project
that
urgently
need
finance
it
would
yield
million
in
saving
mainly
from
increase
purchasing
power
but
anderson
played
down
the
importance
of
cost
saving
we
would
have
do
the
deal
even
without
the
synergy
he
say
bhp
s
shareholder
gradually
familiarise
themselves
with
billiton
s
asset
prior
to
voting
on
the
merger
billiton
they
learn
be
a
major
producer
of
aluminium
and
also
the
world
s
big
producer
of
chrome
and
manganese
ore
and
alloy
with
operation
in
australasia
south
america
and
africa
the
australian
medium
be
essentially
very
hostile
not
so
much
towards
me
but
to
don
argus
and
paul
anderson
brian
gilbertson
say
they
felt
that
great
bhp
asset
have
be
sell
into
the
merger
too
cheaply
in
return
for
asset
in
funny
country
that
they
really
would
prefer
not
to
be
in
some
of
the
name
however
be
all
too
familiar
by
merge
with
billiton
lance
hockridge
say
bhp
be
effectively
buying
back
a
number
of
operation
which
it
have
sell
over
the
year
for
example
gemco
and
temco
be
ex
bhp
business
which
have
be
sell
to

then

the

over
bhp
if
it
become
a
marginal
player
in
the
mining

we
have
to
participate
or
become
a
victim
he
say
if
we
don
t
rio

will
get
together
with
a
big
oil
company

break

bhp
have
conduct
strategic

about
diversify

that
these

make
the

the

greg
combet
the
actu
secretary
claimed
that
the
deal
with
billiton
would
disadvantage
australian
worker
and
eventually
move
control
of
the
company

we
don
t
want
a

to
go
ahead
until
our
concern
be
satisfied
he
say
we
be
go
to
make
sure
that
the
people
here
be
go
to
be
held
to
account
for
the
decision
they
make
today
inside
the
concert
hall
don
argus
react
sharply
when
one
of
the
shareholder
raise
the
reverse
takeover
spectre
the
share
price
be
down
to
and
now
it
s
which
be
a
testament
to
the
focus
we
have
he
say
so
to
say
this
be
a
reverse
takeover
be
nonsense
it
s
not
a
reverse
takeover
as
far
as
my
position
be
concerned
if
it
get
vote
down
then
clearly
i
would
have
to
reconsider
my
position
after
several
hour
of
sometimes
heat
argument
a
majority
of
the
australian
shareholder
finally
raise
their
hand
in
support
of
the
merger
in
johannesburg
billiton
s
shareholder
have
already
give
their
approval
with
unconcealed
jubilation
in
the
final
analysis
per
cent
of
bhp
shareholder
be
in
favour
compare
with
billiton
s
per
cent
refer
to
the
per
cent
add
to
the
pre
merger
share
price
for
billiton
investor
brian
gilbertson
say
we
have
held
out
for
a
premium
and
we
d
get
a
generous
premium
in
the
process
my
shareholder
be
very
happy
and
they
still
be
i
go
down
to
cape
town
and
see
some
institution
and
they
still
thank
me
for
get
them
into
some
of
the
world
s
fine
asset
don
argus
say
the
billiton
team
handle
their
option
extremely
well
we
get
criticise
for
perhaps
overpay
for
the
opportunity
he
say
you
could
argue
that
the
quality
of
the
asset
be
not
the
tier
one
asset
that
other
company
have
but
what
it
do
be
it
provide
a
stable
of
people
with
actual
mining
skill
and
that
s
one
of
the
strength
that
emerge
from
that
merger
and
it
s
one
of
the
strength
underpin
this
company
now
because
i
would
say
that
bhp
do
not
have
the
practical
mining
skill
that
billiton
have
lord
renwick
thought
that
don
argus
understood
the
need
to
change
thing
because
old
bhp
have
a
reputation
for
very
good
asset
but
not
the
great
management
and
very
poor
project
execution
there
be
problem
in
papua
new
guinea
zimbabwe
and
so
on
the
billiton
team
be
an
exceptionally
talented
one
he
say
we
do
pride
ourselves
on
the
fact
that
we
never
have
a
project
which
didn
t
come
in
on
time
and
on
budget
include
the
huge
aluminium
smelter
in
mozambique
which
nobody
thought
we
could
build
this
be
a
very
highly
motivate
bunch
of
people
who
want
to
do
deal
discuss
the
personality
in
both
company
at
that
time
paul
anderson
say
to
renwick
there
will
be
some
cultural
difference
how
would
you
describe
the
billiton
culture
paul
renwick
ask
to
which
anderson
reply
full
steam
ahead
and
damn
the
torpedo
chapter
hunter
and
skinner
the
difference
between
executive
in
the
mining
world
be
neatly
summarise
by
one
billiton
veteran
who
classify
them
as
hunter
or
skinner
the
hunter
be
mainly
guy
who
go
into
the
jungle
and
kill
the
beast
he
be
fond
of
say
the
others
stay
at
home
and
make
thing
from
the
skin
bhp
s
executive
many
of
them
from
a
steelmaking
or
manufacturing
background
fell
mainly
into
the
skinner
category
the
billiton
team
have
be
together
for
year
and
we
suddenly
encounter
a
management
team
that
have
just
be
thrown
together
dave
munro
say
they
be
still
in
the
process
of
work
out
the
structure
of
the
group
and
the
strategy
they
be
happy
to
sit
down
and
work
out
how
to
run
this
big
new
company
even
before
shareholder
have
give
their
consent
a
team
of
senior
executive
from
both
company
be
burning
the
midnight
oil
to
solve
the
prickly
question
of
staff
integration
in
these
exercise
you
ve
get
the
deal
team
and
you
ve
get
the
merger
team
say
mike
salamon
who
have
move
to
melbourne
at
the
end
of
march
and
be
living
in
a
penthouse
in
one
of
the
tower
block
at
beacon
cove
overlook
port
phillip
bay
the
stuff
that
the
banker
get
excite
about
be
the
deal
they
get
their
fee
and
then
you
ve
get
to
make
it
work
the
finance
guy
have
be
very
involve
in
the
transaction
but
it
s
the
operating
guy
who
ve
get
to
make
it
work
my
counterpart
brad
mill
and
i
sat
down
and
over
the
course
of
a
few
day
essentially
design
a
new
organisation
then
his
team
and
my
team
met
and
we
work
out
the
integration
plan
first
of
all
there
be
no
consultant
we
agree
we
be
go
to
do
this
ourselves
which
be
unheard
of
salamon
mill
and
ian
fraser
who
take
over
as
head
of
bhp
billiton
s
human
resource
department
spent
a
year
put
the
integration
together
in
the
begin
they
could
only
do
the
planning
because
the
competition
commission
have
yet
to
give
its
approval
when
the
commission
finally
say
yes
and
the
green
light
be
all
in
place
and
the
deal
consummate
the
actual
execution
be
very
easy
mill
say
the
team
have
work
it
all
out
and
we
knew
exactly
what
we
be
go
to
do
with
the
people
they
be
thoroughly
professional
people
i
like
the
billiton
guy
it
be
a
good
group
paul
anderson
admit
in
an
interview
that
bhp
have
become
dysfunctional
and
entangle
in
red
tape
that
although
executive
want
to
progress
they
end
up
take
grander
title
but
with
few
add
responsibility
bhp
have
a
good
culture
in
term
of
manage
a
large
organisation
and
have
procedure
and
practice
well
define
system
to
institutionalise
efficiency
he
say
billiton
have
a
very
entrepreneurial
culture
of
find
an
opportunity
and
grab
it
but
they
do
not
necessarily
follow
it
up
and
get
the
best
out
of
it
there
be
no
centralise
procurement
activity
they
do
not
have
a
well
developed
share
facility
for
back
office
function
billiton
be
ready
fire
aim
we
be
ready
aim
aim
we
find
it
hard
to
pull
the
trigger
he
have
be
successful
in
move
bhp
s
culture
about
per
cent
down
the
desire
path
but
billiton
would
get
it
the
rest
of
the
way
in
one
bound
on
june
the
federal
treasurer
peter
costello
announce
the
government
s
blessing
of
the
merger
although
it
be
accompany
by
a
string
of
condition
design
to
uphold
the
national
amour
propre
to
retain
an
australian
identity
the
australian
firb
demand
that
bhp
billiton
s
headquarters
be
locate
in
australia
that
the
chief
executive
and
chief
financial
officer
have
their
main
residence
in
australia
that
a
listing
be
retain
on
the
australian
stock
exchange
and
that
most
board
meeting
take
place
in
australia
the
treasurer
be
clearly
exercise
about
this
south
african
incursion
into
australian
big
business
costello
wag
his
finger
in
my
face
when
i
go
to
pay
my
respect
brian
gilbertson
recall
and
for
understandable
reason
billiton
s
top
team
gilbertson
davis
munro
salamon
kloppers
and
fraser
would
make
a
powerful
impact
but
then
mick
davis
chief
development
officer
designate
of
bhp
billiton
sent
shock
wave
through
the
industry
when
he
suddenly
resign
to
become
chief
executive
of
xstrata
a
relatively
unsuccessful
anglo
swiss
mining
company
in
his
farewell
message
davis
say
his
time
at
billiton
have
be
replete
with
invaluable
and
reward
experience
but
he
now
have
the
opportunity
to
take
a
leadership
role
in
a
small
company
he
add
as
it
be
small
there
be
more
room
for
grow
it
the
job
i
enjoy
most
this
be
an
understatement
xstrata
be
mire
in
us
million
of
debt
the
real
story
of
davis
s
departure
from
the
bhp
billiton
scenario
however
be
told
here
for
the
first
time
the
view
among
my
colleague
be
that
essentially
it
would
be
the
management
team
of
billiton
who
would
be
run
the
new
company
he
say
i
didn
t
take
that
view
i
say
to
them
i
think
this
be
a
very
australian
centric
organisation
i
do
not
think
that
they
be
go
to
allow
a
management
takeover
by
comparison
bhp
be
an
organisation
with
a
huge
amount
of
process
and
bureaucracy
and
process
be
almost
more
important
than
the
outcome
billiton
be
relatively
light
on
that
and
there
be
no
doubt
whose
process
would
win
out
i
didn
t
think
that
be
an
organisation
that
i
want
to
battle
through
i
be
still
happy
to
stay
on
i
be
not
convince
it
be
go
to
be
the
seamless
deal
that
everybody
thought
it
be
go
to
be
but
i
do
everything
i
could
to
make
sure
that
the
deal
would
happen
because
i
thought
it
would
be
very
good
for
our
shareholder
there
be
some
incident
the
first
be
when
don
argus
and
paul
visit
london
shortly
before
we
have
meeting
with
all
the
management
team
paul
say
to
me
so
why
be
you
against
the
deal
i
wasn
t
happy
with
that
approach
i
didn
t
appreciate
somebody
attack
me
in
that
way
that
be
the
first
negative
the
second
negative
be
the
fact
that
the
chief
executive
officer
and
chief
financial
officer
have
to
be
resident
in
australia
that
have
be
negotiate
between
bhp
and
firb
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
be
something
that
bhp
engineer
and
i
didn
t
take
very
kindly
to
that
thirdly
i
have
no
intention
of
move
my
family
to
melbourne
i
think
it
s
the
wrong
place
to
be
run
an
international
mining
company
i
still
think
it
s
the
wrong
place
however
when
brian
go
over
for
the
penultimate
meeting
thing
be
about
to
fall
off
the
rail
the
bhp
board
take
the
view
that
paul
have
be
out
negotiate
and
out
manoeuvre
by
brian
and
ourselves
he
be
accuse
by
one
of
his
director
of
drop
his
pant
brian
come
back
to
south
africa
and
told
me
that
i
be
see
to
be
the
touchstone
of
this
sense
of
concern
because
of
my
insistence
on
remain
in
london
i
be
go
to
be
the
guy
who
eventually
move
this
company
to
london
so
i
say
brian
if
that
s
the
case
i
m
happy
to
step
back
i
ll
see
the
transaction
through
and
go
off
initially
that
seem
to
be
acceptable
but
then
a
few
day
later
they
say
could
they
not
take
the
job
of
chief
financial
officer
and
split
it
between
myself
and
chip
where
chip
becomes
the
chief
financial
officer
and
i
become
what
s
call
the
chief
development
officer
and
i
could
reside
in
london
we
do
all
those
thing
we
split
the
job
up
and
how
it
be
go
to
work
chip
and
i
would
have
work
fine
together
but
i
just
sat
back
and
thought
to
myself
now
be
a
good
time
to
make
a
break
there
clearly
be
concern
about
me
there
s
go
to
be
tension
go
forward
i
didn
t
appreciate
paul
s
approach
in
fact
i
never
appreciate
paul
s
management
style
at
all
and
i
thought
he
and
i
would
clash
go
forward
i
thought
you
know
i
ve
have
a
great
time
in
billiton
this
be
a
great
transaction
for
shareholder
what
a
good
time
to
move
on
and
do
something
else
and
that
s
why
i
take
the
decision
to
leave
i
communicate
that
decision
prior
to
the
announcement
of
the
transaction
in
march
but
say
i
would
keep
it
quiet
and
do
all
the
roadshows
paul
and
i
do
the
roadshows
together
and
that
be
fine
brian
gilbertson
be
sorry
to
lose
davis
but
appreciate
that
he
would
have
found
it
difficult
work
in
a
more
bureaucratic
environment
which
the
billiton
executive
perceive
bhp
to
be
it
have
a
big
head
office
with
one
or
two
thousand
people
whereas
we
just
sat
in
a
little
office
in
the
strand
with
people
so
mick
felt
that
wouldn
t
work
out
for
him
gilbertson
say
he
also
want
to
go
out
and
sail
his
own
ship
and
he
s
do
some
great
thing
at
xstrata
he
be
the
only
member
of
my
team
who
didn
t
come
along
with
me
all
my
key
member
get
key
position
but
they
generally
get
them
because
they
be
very
good
i
would
take
over
from
paul
in
two
year
under
the
original
plan
and
i
would
be
his
deputy
for
the
initial
period
so
i
could
learn
the
bit
of
the
business
i
didn
t
know
and
get
to
know
the
australian
i
guess
that
s
part
of
the
reason
it
be
perceive
to
be
a
reverse
takeover
paul
and
i
didn
t
have
any
issue
that
i
be
aware
of
we
work
well
together
i
respect
what
he
be
do
he
d
come
in
from
outside
the
industry
and
have
change
the
culture
greatly
and
give
bhp
a
sense
of
pride
back
in
gilbertson
s
opinion
anderson
have
secure
a
good
transaction
for
bhp
s
shareholder
but
the
press
didn
t
share
that
view
it
be
unforgiving
they
flog
don
argus
and
paul
for
month
even
now
you
hear
echo
of
it
at
least
two
or
three
time
a
year
some
journalist
or
analyst
will
put
out
a
set
of
figure
that
show
what
bhp
have
effectively
paid
gilbertson
say
give
what
iron
ore
have
do
what
oil
have
do
give
what
copper
mine
have
do
we
didn
t
have
copper
in
billiton
we
have
the
smelter
and
coal
mine
in
south
africa
if
you
do
the
sum
that
way
it
really
do
look
as
though
they
paid
a
high
price
but
at
the
time
i
thought
it
be
a
very
sensible
deal
it
put
bhp
billiton
at
the
top
of
the
pile
it
give
them
a
new
sense
of
pride
it
really
ignite
the
bhp
interest
in
the
world
of
mining
as
oppose
to
the
narrower
focus
on
australia
they
have
withdrawn
after
the
magma
thing
an
experience
that
have
brand
them
the
merger
make
them
number
one
and
whereas
before
bhp
didn
t
feature
in
the
review
of
the
mining
company
publish
by
london
stockbroker
because
they
be
down
there
in
australia
they
be
suddenly
top
of
the
list
as
we
d
create
it
as
a
dual
list
company
it
have
the
follow
both
of
the
london
analyst
and
the
australian
analyst
and
that
way
we
kept
the
internationalisation
and
a
much
wider
and
more
intensive
exposure
among
international
investor
i
think
it
be
a
great
deal
look
what
the
company
have
do
since
then
but
first
there
be
a
great
deal
of
corporate
engineering
to
complete
very
sensibly
they
put
the
two
board
into
two
much
big

derek

which
we

take
that
up
and
for
a
couple
of

it
hugely
however
the

follow
the
poor

decision
of

asset
in
the

category
we
invent
a
number
of
thing
to
try
to
make
sure
it
didn
t
look
like
bhp
and
it
didn

look
like
billiton

it
would
be
bhp
billiton
mike
salamon

the

be
to

strategic
decision

engineer
the

exit
from
the

that

for
so
long
be
its
proudest
possession
at
the
time
of
the
newcastle
closure
bhp
steel
be
still
part
of
bhp
lance
hockridge
say
then
in
the
company
separate
the
long
product
business
so
have
close
the
steelworks
part
of
newcastle
the
long
product
business
be
reconfigured
around
the
whyalla
steelworks
and
the
rooty
hill
mini
mill
and
it
be
spun
off
into
a
separate
company
name
onesteel
at
the
time
bhp

with

the

paul

introduce
a

charter
a

statement
that
commit
the

company
to
deliver
value
to
its
shareholder
through
the
exploitation
of
natural

while
at
the
same
time
maintain
an
override
commitment
to
safety
environmental
responsibility
and
sustainable
development
the
annual
report
be
pepper
with
reference
to
the
charter
which
anderson
say
be
the
foundation
stone
of
the
entire
operation
a
prudent
move
in
view
of
the
ok

disaster
paul
anderson
have
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
bhp
design
the
charter
while
we
in
billiton
be
a
little
more
buccaneer
about
life
mike
salamon
say
we
didn
t
get
carry
away
with
this
formal
stuff
because
there
be
so
few
of
us
i
could
look
you
in
the
eye
and
we
could
work
out
what
our
mission
be
i
didn
t
have
to
get
too
bureaucratic
about
it
but
we
recognise
we
have
this
huge
company
we
have
to
play
that
game
we
change
one
word
in
paul
anderson
s
vision
statement
we
take
out
the
word
australian
and
put
in
the
word
global
that
be
the
only
thing
we
change
we
like
his
value
and
everything
else
accord
to
graham
evans
anderson
found
it
quite
important
to
define
the
value
in
which
the
company
work
that
there
need
to
be
real
clarity
around
the
business
strategy
and
around
how
the
company
do
business
it
be
basically
as
a
consequence
of
bhp
do
business
across
a
whole
range
of
country
that
it
hadn
t
previously
do
business
in
there
be
uncertainty
on
the
part
of
some
of
the
employee
on
what
they
could
and
couldn
t
do
there
be
clarity
around
the
legal
issue
but
much
less
clarity
around
what
attitude
the
business
take
to
issue
that
be
in
the
grey
area
for
example
facilitation
payment
there
be
certain
issue
that
be
clear
cut
issue
that
be
illegal
and
improper
but
there
be
plenty
of
others
which
be
judgmental
issue
and
what
the
company
try
to
do
be
to
expose
employee
to
the
framework
of
global
business
conduct
and
get
people
to
think
about
and
talk
about
what
that
meant
in
their
workplace
john
prescott
start
this
and
paul
anderson
follow
it
through
it
be
however
merely
the
forerunner
of
many
good
intention
and
ecological
initiative
which
be
open
to
question
anderson
be
on
more
solid
ground
when
he
promise
investor
that
the
company
would
announce
a
new
strategic
framework
early
the
follow
year
with
an
emphasis
on
return
on

strong
customer
focus

follow
month

i

but
then
i
do
a
deal
with
don
argus
and
the
remuneration
committee
that
i
would
get
an
apartment
a
very
nice
apartment
overlook
the
botanic

the
eternal

an
old
hospital
once
i
live
right
at
the
top
of
that
it
be
at
this
point
that
he
start
a
bumpy
relationship
with
the
australian
press
that
continue
to
this
day
when
brian
have
his
first
meeting
as
deputy
chief
executive
around
the

with
senior
australian

he
make
the
point
that
he
now
have
an
apartment
in
melbourne
and
be
living
there
marc
gonsalves
say
the
first
question
be
from
some
hack
who
say
what
colour
be
the
sheet
on
your
bed
i
want
to
get
rid
of
this
ridiculous
spotlight
that
be
on
us
in
australia
where
you
couldn
t
fart
without
someone
write
a
story
i
want
the
freedom
we
have
in
london
to
get
on
with
the
business
of
the
company
and
take
control
of
the
communication
around
it
so
that
when
we
have
something
to
say
we
d
tell
them
gilbertson
however
appear
unconcerned
he
and
his
wife
rensche
sample
the
city
s
culinary
delight
and
declare
that
melbourne
have
the
best
chef
in
the
world
he
attend
a
couple
of
australian
rule
football
match
but
although
he
enjoy
the
spectacle
and
the
passion
his
favourite
sport
remain
squash
and
cycling
as
a
symbol
of
his
successful
campaign
he
have
a
picture
of
brigitte
bardot
the
famous
pout
one
hung
on
the
wall
of
his
office
in
bhp
tower
i
really
have
be
very
fortunate
he
say
look
back
at
that
remarkable
period
the
purchase
of
the
billiton
asset
be
perfectly
time
when
anglo
make
its
move
on
us
and
bought
the
rembrandt
share
we
be
ready
paul
anderson
come
through
at
the
right
moment
we
get
it
just
right
we
get
the
right
deal
for
billiton
and
for
bhp
the
timing
be
terribly
important
too
to
make
the
next
step
however
john
jackson
the
wise
and
emollient
deputy
chairman
saw
trouble
ahead
it
become
clear
pretty
quickly
that
don
argus
be
not
look
forward
to
the
day
when
brian
gilbertson
would
take
over
from
paul
anderson
he
say
there
be
uneasiness
in
don
s
mind
about
how
he
saw
the
proper
relationship
between
a
board
and
its
chairman
and
chief
executive
and
how
brian
might
see
it
it
emerge
that
before
paul
and
brian
have
ever
met
but
at
about
the
time
we
d
heard
that
bhp
might
be
interested
in
brian
bhp
have
make
inquiry
about
brian
and
be
advise
that
he
be
i
think
the
exact
expression
use
by
don
strong
head
one
could
see
wind
up
a
pretty
familiar
conflict
which
i
ve
see
in
other
company
where
you
get
a
very
capable
and
powerful
leader
of
the
executive
team
which
brian
have
undoubtedly
show
he
be
at
billiton
and
a
strong
nonexecutive
board
chair
by
a
very
determine
person
who
have
clearly
get
in
the
back
of
his
mind
the
interest
of
australia
plc
there
be
go
to
be
the
most
enormous
explosion
part
iv
the
power
chapter
life
with
brian
the
big
australian
expire
with
the
start
of
the
new
millennium
at
the
venerable
age
of

in
this
brave
new
world
bhp
billiton
the
lusty
offspring
of
the
union
be
gift
with
a
new
nickname
courtesy
of
chairman
don
argus
the
big
fella
i
ve
never
refer
to
the
company
as
the
big
australian
that
s
something
i
m
very
careful
about
argus
say
lean
forward
in
his
chair
in
the
copper
room
at
bhp
billiton
headquarters
with
per
cent
of
the
shareholder
base
offshore
under
the
dual
list
company
structure
the
important
thing
for
australia
then
he
say
be
to
look
after
its
national
heritage
in
term
of
natural
resource
and
what
grows
off
that
be
to
me
the
big
advantage
for
a
company
with
sovereign
asset
of
the
quality
that
we
have
nation
that
do
not
protect
their
export
income
have
be
hollow
out
in
similar
circumstance
australia
have
to
be
careful
or
it
would
finish
up
like
canada
where
their
endowment
be
lose
they
don
t
have
a
national
champion
as
such
so
the
big
fella
encapsulate
the
argus
philosophy
the
new
company
would
be
progressive
and
global
still
australia
s
champion
but
less
parochial
than
the
big
australian
of
yesteryear
on
the
th
floor
of
bhp
tower
paul
anderson
and
brian
gilbertson
work
on
a
new
strategic
framework
that
would
lead
the
dual
list
entity
into
a
promise
land
of
reliable
cash
flow
and
high
dividend
thereby
justify
their
faith
in
the
controversial
merger
and
silence
the
bhp
grumbler
who
be
still
complain
that
the
equity
ratio
have
favour
billiton
shareholder
at
the
same
time
the
integration
process
be
complete
we
d
set
ourselves
a
number
of
metric
such
as
what
do
success
look
like
mike
salamon
say
one
thing
you
don
t
want
to
do
be
to
miss
on
the
synergy
you
thought
you
d
have
and
you
also
don
t
want
to
constipate
the
business
you
can
have
a
lot
of
infighting
and
then
decision
stop
be
make
we
have
five
metric
and
we
report
against
those
metric
every
month
in
february
we
deliver
it
to
the
board
we
then
get
out
of
integration
mode
and
go
into
run
mode
brian
gilbertson
say
we
have
promise
the
shareholder
that
the
integration
would
be
smooth
that
we
would
achieve
a
variety
of
economy
and
then
perhaps
above
all
because
of
the
diversity
of
this
new
company
that
the
shareholder
could
rely
on
our
cash
flow
chip
goodyear
and
his
team
built
a
big
model
which
simulated
what
the
new
company
would
look
like
if
price
fluctuate
or
if
the
exchange
rate
between
the
us
dollar
and
the
south
african
rand
change
he
use
the
past
ten
year
worth
of
quarterly
data
and
the
amaze
thing
be
that
it
come
out
with
a
continuous
cash
flow
no
matter
what
you
do
to
something
there
would
be
an
offset
change
which
would
keep
it
stable
that
be
not
new
it
be
just
apply
harry
markowitz
s
portfolio
theory
to
the
merge
entity
we
make
it
a
key
platform
of
our
strategy
that
our
shareholder
could
rely
on
stable
cash
flow
and
we
could
do
our
planning
properly
because
we
wouldn
t
be
cripple
in
some
year
when
the
cash
flow
dry
up
we
d
have
a
stable
cash
flow
and
we
could
sensibly
expand
but
before
gilbertson
could
present
his
vision
to
shareholder
the
boodarie

the
other
three
be
shut
down
pending
an
inspection
to
determine
the
cause
of
fracture
that
have
mysteriously
developed
in
the
gas
pipe
since
bhp
billiton
be
unable
to
meet

for
the

anderson

that

it
be
the

a

in
sydney
brian
and
i
have
work
jointly
on
this
framework
and
share
a
common
vision
of
the
future
anderson
told
an
audience
of
investor
many
of
them
diehard
bhp
shareholder
however
it
be
only
appropriate
that
brian
as
the
incoming
ceo
should
present
this
framework
as
he
will
be
responsible
for
building
on
it
and
take
it
to
the
next
level
anderson
sat
down
without
reveal
that
he
intend
to
step
down
a
lot
sooner
than
anyone
expect
the
handover
to
gilbertson
happen
at
the
time
we
declare
the
integration
complete
mike
salamon
say
paul
have
a
few
project
he
personally
take
on
board
like
the
steel
spin
off
and
brian
start
to
run
the
go
forward
business
from
january
february
when
gilbertson
start
speak
his
objective
be
to
make
the
old
bhp
stakeholder
feel
a
little
more
reassure
that
their
national
treasure
have
end
up
not
in
the
hand
of
a
crazy
gunslinger
but
a
serious
shareholder
sensitive
corporate
executive
it
be
but
a
year
ago
that
paul
anderson
and
i
announce
the
intention
to
merge
bhp
and
billiton
he
begin
it
be
the
culmination
of
a
process
of
consolidation
that
have
be
underway
in
the
metal
and
mining
industry
for
a
decade
the
consolidation
driver
be
numerous
important
among
these
be
the
generally
poor
investment
performance
of
the
single
commodity
corporation
with
only
one
outlet
for
their
cash
flow
one
trick
pony
tend
to
over
expand
when
the
relevant
commodity
price
be
high
and
then
face
cash
starvation
and
capital
write
offs
when
price
inevitably
decline
this
boom
to
bust
pattern
typical
of
the
resource
industry
of
old
drove
shareholder
to
distraction
a
second
factor
be
the
escalate
cost
and
complexity
of
implement
large
resource
project
size
be
increasingly
characteristic
of
the
most
efficient
asset
and
particularly
so
in
relation
to
environmental
and
sustainable
development
pressure
a
third
driver
be
the
desire
of
portfolio
manager
for
large
liquid
stock
which
permit
major
change
in
portfolio
weighting
without
significantly
affect
the
ruling
share
price
i
be
often
told
by
the
major
investor
that
company
with
market
capitalisation
of
less
than
us
billion
do
not
even
show
up
on
their
investment
radar
screen
finally
i
think
that
the
past
few
year
have
see
the
emergence
of
a
new
generation
of
resource
executive
driven
to
achieve
shareholder
value
rather
than
by
emotional
attachment
to
particular
asset
the
extent
of
that
consolidation
have
be
remarkable
gilbertson
say
the
top
five
metal
and
mining
company
in
have
account
for
less
than
per
cent
of
the
industry
s
us
billion
total
equity
value
the
then
large
company
bhp
have
a
market
capitalisation
of
around
us
billion
now
the
top
five
company
account
for
almost
per
cent
of
the
resource
equity
value
of
us
billion
effectively
a
double
for
the
top
five
over
the
decade
bhp
billiton
be
still
the
large
company
four
time
big
than
bhp
in
and
as
large
as
the
top
five
aggregate
in
that
earlier
year
the
merger
create
not
only
the
industry
leader
but
also
one
unlike
any
other
that
the
industry
have
see
before
my
colleague
and
i
believe
that
our
company
have
unrivalled
potential
to
bring
shareholder
value
in
the
year
ahead
gilbertson
say
so
that
it
will
have
a
strong
claim
to
be
a
core
hold
in
major
international
portfolio
the
generation
of
stable
cash
flow
be
one
of
the
group
s
major
strength
he
say
enable
it
to
meet
dividend
expectation
and
to
fund
growth
opportunity
on
the
basis
of
merit
without
concern
about
short
term
cash
flow
disruption
our
decision
to
sell
down
our
interest
in
the
columbus
stainless
steel
plant
to
exit
the
arutmin
coal
deposit
in
indonesia
and
to
exit
ok
tedi
be
driven
by
the
desire
to
improve
the
portfolio
to
reduce
its
volatility
to
stabilise
its
cash
flow
and
to
eliminate
problem
area
gilbertson
say
even
the
spin
out
of
our
high
quality
bhp
steel
business
on
schedule
for
july
will
leave
a
portfolio
well
match
to
our
desire
structure
i
must
pay
particular
tribute
here
to
paul
anderson
who
as
chief
executive
have
dealt
decisively
with
a
raft
of
problem
asset
to
restore
the
quality
of
the
overall
portfolio
this
strategic
framework
presentation
be
generally
well
receive
among
investor
analyst
and
financial
journalist
it
look
as
though
bhp
billiton
have
cast
off
the
sackcloth
and
ash
of
the
s
and
be
thrust
ahead
into
the
new
decade
on
may
however
the

reveal
that
its
third
quarter

profit
have
slump

reduction
of

in

from

our

despite
this

environment
be
a
very
solid
result
at
the
same
time
it
be
announce
that
paul
anderson
would
relinquish
his
job
five
month
earlier
than
expect
i
get
the
distinct
impression
that
he
be
very
proud
of
what
he
have
do
but
he
wasn
t
sad
to
say
goodbye
either
mike
salamon
say
in
fact
anderson
now
refers
to
his
term
in
melbourne
as
my
favourite
time
we
work
well
together
but
it
make
sense
to
shorten
the
two
year
period
gilbertson
say
the
integration
have
go
as
well
as
we
thought
it
would
and
i
become
chief
executive
on
july
i
have
to
be
sure
i
didn
t
drop
the
ball
in
an
official
company
statement
gilbertson
be
described
as
very
much
the
architect
of

success
don

look
forward
to
work
with
him
in
his
expand

it
be
smooth
lord
renwick
say
paul
be
very
happy
to
step
back
he
s
a
very
classy
person
and
he
hand
the
rein
to
brian
what
then
happen
be
in
a
sense
almost
inevitable
brian
be
a
very
hard
charge
ceo
and
don
be
a
tough
and
experienced
chairman
don
and
brian
be
head
for
a
very
early
test
of
strength
john
jackson
say
the
test
of
strength
emerge
in
relation
to
a
proposition
that
brian
be
very
keen
on
and
that
be
merge
bhp
billiton
with
rio
he
thought
that
would
create
a
world
leader
in
the
mining
industry
and
in
a
world
in
which
the
demand
for
commodity
be
go
to
take
off
there
seem
to
be
no
doubt
that
gilbertson
both
in
his
background
and

represent

mr

lucky
enough
to
be
in

not

to
have

enough
although
both
the

in

the
real

overwhelmingly

good

apparent
brian

i
get
along
just
fine
on
a
personal
basis
but
you
might
imagine
in
a
set
when
you
ve
get
a
transition
go
between
a
fairly
headstrong

to
another

it
would

anderson

our
basic
strategy

our
view
of
the

how

there

a

there
could

so
i
thought
the

be
not

i
rejoin

in

we
have
an
excellent

on

manor
one
of
lord

just
outside

and
on
friday
june
the
board
met
at
the
versailles
suite
at
danesfield
house
at
eight
o
clock
in
the
morning
brian
gilbertson
be
in
his
element
he
have
a
list
of
bullet
point
that
spell
out
his
vision
as
the
incoming
chief
executive
danesfield
be
really
brian
s
first
opportunity
to
address
the
board
on
a
strategic
vision
for
the
company
say
chip
goodyear
and
he
present
something
that
he
call
and
it
be
meant
to
be
billion
market
value
and
a
p
e
price
earnings
ratio
and
he
talk
about
try
to
create
an
entity
that
look
like
that
at
the
time
the
market
value
would
have
be
around
billion
maybe
a
little
bit
more
so
it
be
quite
an
aggressive
vision
for
the
company
that
needle
to
say
would
have
require
some
significant
acquisition
to
get
there
i
would
say
there
be
some
sceptic
around
the
table
about
whether
or
not
that
be
really
something
that
be
achievable
and
certainly
achievable
quickly
after
the
combination
of
bhp
and
billiton
gilbertson
do
indeed
have
a
significant
acquisition
in
mind
a
merger
between
bhp
billiton
and
rio
tinto
as
rio
s
london
address
be
st
james
s
square
the
merger
become
know
as
project
brian
give
his
assessment
of
where
the
industry
be
go
with
particular
reference
to
the
huge
emerge
economy
in
china
india
and
south
america
john
jackson
say
he
thought
africa
if
it
could
get
its
act
together
would
eventually
be
important
but
would
lag
somewhere
behind
he
present
a
very
interest
picture
of
where
the
mining
industry
be
and
reckon
there
should
be
far
consolidation
that
bhp
billiton
be
very
well
place
to
participate
in
that
and
one
of
the
thing
that
leapt
out
as
be
theoretically
obvious
be
rio
oh
gosh
yes
say
marius
kloppers
who
attend
the
exco
meeting
i
remember
the
vision
thing
it
be
for
a
combination
of
rio
tinto
certainly
there
be
a
discussion
if
i
recall
perhaps
yes
it
be
danesfield
i
recall
talk
about
the
rio
issue
but
i
also
recall
talk
about
russia
s
resource
and
we
talk
quite
extensively
about
how
we
step
up
our
activity
in
marketing
product
to
china
mike
salamon
saw
project
as
the
next
logical
step
on
the
consolidation
ladder
the
billiton
way
of
do
thing
be
to
keep
move
he
say
so
have
built
one
platform
you
be
immediately
think
well
where
s
the
next
one
we
be
in
an
environment
where
you
still
have
enron
and
much
much
big
company
than
us
and
so
we
be
not
compete
against
mining
business
we
be
compete
for
a
place
in
the
sun
where
size
actually
do
matter
that
a
merger
between
bhp
billiton
and
rio
tinto
would
create
the
big
entity
in
the
energy
and
resource
universe
be
self
evident
it
be
also
true
that
in
financial
wunderkind
chip
goodyear
gilbertson
have
the
perfect
man
to
work
out
the
number
do
the
merger
have
his
support
at
the
time
that
s
one
of
the
thing
about
the
way
i
run
my
business
goodyear
say
i
do
the
analysis
and
then
reach
the
conclusion
as
oppose
to
reach
the
conclusion
and
then
do
the
analysis
so
i
d
say
the
most
that
be
go
on
at
that
time
be
an
assessment
of
the
opportunity
i
wouldn
t
probably
have
get
to
the
point
at
that
time
where
you
reach
the
conclusion
on
whether
it
make
sense
it
s
always
be
an
intrigue
strategic
question
the
value
of
a
combination
i
look
at
any
transaction
any
investment
do
it
make
strategic
sense
be
there
a
value
proposition
and
can
you
deliver
it
and
you
have
to
have
a
positive
answer
on
all
of
those
thing
in
order
to
push
the
button
so
at
that
point
where
on
the
surface
the
strategic
issue
be
where
people
would
say
of
course
the
opportunity
to
investigate
that
be
yet
to
come
in
the
conference
chip
goodyear
do
a
major
part
of
the
presentation
on
us
gilbertson
say
the
board
endorse
these
initiative
include
project
in
principle
the
possibility
of
a
merger
with
rio
tinto
have
be
give
the
green
light
realistically
though
could
gilbertson
pull
it
off
and
would
it
bring
him
into
conflict
with
don
argus
a
former
chief
executive
skilled
in
takeover
don
felt
very
strongly
that
matter
of
that
sort
should
be
firmly
in
the
hand
of
the
board
which
should
determine
both
tactic
and
strategy
john
jackson
say
brian
strongly
disagreed
with
that
and
felt
that
this
be
fundamentally
a
matter
that
should
be
handle
by
the
executive
team
keep
the
board
inform
but
with
it
be
fundamentally
a
matter
for
the
chief
executive
and
his
team
to
take
the
initiative
on
that
be
the
origin
of
their
big
fall
out
chapter
road
to
rio
rio
tinto
take
its
name
from
the
famous
red
river
of
andalusia
whose
mine
have
supply
the
phoenician
greek
carthaginian
and
roman
with
copper
and
iron
since
time
immemorial
accord
to
local
legend
they
even
supply
the
empire
of
king
solomon
and
could
justifiably
claim
to
be
the
fabled

s
mine
by
bob
wilson
have
risen
to
the
chair
at
rio
tinto
after
a
golden
run
as
chief
executive
born
in
suburban
surrey
wilson
study
economics
at
sussex
university
he
begin
his
career
in
as
an
economist
at
dunlop
a
move
he
later
described
as
my
first
career
mistake
but
soon
move
to
mobil
oil
he
then
join
rtz
in
as
a
financial
analyst
before
switch
to
operational
duty
run
the
european
zinc
and
lead
smelt
subsidiary
wilson
played
a
key
role
in
all
of
rio
tinto
s
major
strategic
development
recognise
the
potential
of
the
escondida
copper
mine
and
negotiate
rtz
s
per
cent
stake
in
and
then
acquire
bp
mineral
in
as
chief
executive
he
orchestrate
the
dual
list
merger
between
rtz
and
its
australian
subsidiary
cra
in
which
create
the
modern
rio
tinto
i
become
chief
executive
of
rtz
in
bob
wilson
say
speak
for
the
first
time
about
the
controversial
merger
that
have
so
infuriate
don
argus
rtz
own
per
cent
of
cra
in
the
early
s
but
have
agree
with
the
australian
government
to
dilute
that
percentage
over
time
to
per
cent
rtz
have
traditionally
be
a
bit
more
of
a
mining
finance
house
than
a
mining
company
but
follow
the
acquisition
of
bp
mineral
it
suddenly
own
a
lot
of
directly
control
operation
from
that
it
be
go
to
be
clear
clear
to
me
anyway
and
get
increasingly
clear
to
some
people
in
cra
that
we
be
go
to
be
tread
on
one
another
s
toe
a
bit
because
rtz
be
now
a
mining
operator
and
a
mining
company
focus
particularly
and
solely
in
that
sector
with
global
aspiration
basically
we
need
to
work
through
what
this
meant
for
rtz
and
cra
and
how
they
would
work
together
and
how
that
relationship
be
go
to
work
in
the
future
a
few
of
us
have
be
think
about
it
and
talk
about
it
for
a
little
while
then
fairly
early
rtz
do
a
deal
to
get
into
the
other
major
copper
discovery
of
the
last
year
it
have
already
get
into
escondida
so
the
next
one
be
grasberg
which
freeport
mcmoran
have
in
indonesia
in
early
rio
tinto
and
freeport
establish
a
joint
venture
under
which
rio
tinto
become
entitle
to
per
cent
of
additional
production
as
a
result
of
the
expansion
of
the
grasberg
mining
project
in
west
papua
we
do
a
very
attractive
deal
which
in
a
way
serve
to
crystallise
the
potential
issue
between
rtz
and
cra
wilson
say
the
operation
be
up
there
in
west
papua
traditionally
cra
s
doorstep
they
d
never
even
have
a
look
in
at
a
deal
there
it
become
clear
from
both
side
that
not
only
be
we
head
for
a
potential
conflict
of
interest
but
it
be
also
go
to
be
a
problem
for
cra
s
aspiration
certainly
outside
australia
if
we
couldn
t
find
a
constructive
way
to
resolve
this
it
be
also
clear
that
as
rtz
and
cra
be
both
substantially
focus
on
mining
it
would
make
sense
in
term
of
rationalise
the
area
of
overlap
where
we
be
waste
effort
in
term
of
some
of
the
overall
research
effort
in
identify
opportunity
discussion
about
a
merger
begin
after
the
then
cra
chairman
john
uhrig
ask
wilson
if
rtz
be
prepared
to
make
a
takeover
offer
for
the
minority
he
wasn
t
say
he
want
that
to
happen
but
be
we
prepared
to
do
that
wilson
say
my
answer
be
no
i
actually
want
to
retain
the
best
of
both
company
include
australian
quotation
of
cra
and
cra
management
we
then
spent
six
month
between
us
look
at
various
way
of
how
we
might
proceed
and
we
come
up
with
a
modernise
version
of
the
dual
list
structure
that
shell
and
unilever
have
use
before
it
have
some
characteristic
of
both
of
those
but
we
also
say
surely
they
wouldn
t
design
them
quite
that
way
if
they
be
design
with
a
clean
sheet
of
paper
today
what
would
they
do
differently
we
say
surely
there
have
to
be
one
head
office
rather
than
multiple
head
office
otherwise
you
don
t
get
a
coherent
management
surely
there
have
to
be
the
same
member
of
the
board
of
both
company
or
potentially
you
get
a
rather
chaotic
decision
process
or
a
very
bureaucratic
or
politicise
one
so
let
s
have
the
same
director
of
both
company
we
look
at
what
s
a
modern
day
version
of
the
way
those
guy
set
thing
up
year
ago
in
those
company
i
think
we
do
get
it
pretty
well
right
the
issue
then
be
if
we
be
go
to
merge
these
company
on
a
non
premium
basis
i
wilson
don
t
have
a
problem
sell
this
to
my
shareholder
the
problem
be
go
to
be
sell
it
to
the
cra
shareholder
and
the
australian
government
the
burden
of
that
argument
wasn
t
actually
carry
by
wilson
the
hard
work
be
do
by
john
uhrig
who
be
chairman
and
leon
davis
who
be
chief
executive
of
cra
in
persuade
those
constituency
that
this
be
the
right
thing
to
do
in
the
interest
of
australia
and
the
australian

left

the
challenge

be
in
translate
his

fast
move

style
into
a
much
large

adjustment

that

true
my
usage

relatively
low

with
people
such
as
mike

who
have

broad

could

rather
than

on
tap
anyway
the
furtherest
it
get
in
my
day
be
a
request
as
to
whether
we
really
should
have
these

whether
they
be
justifiable

for
a

meeting
in

the

particular
the
ex
bhp
director
felt
that
it
be
inappropriate
for
company
to
have
such
accoutrement
so
we
have
to
sell
them
all
because
bhp
have
go
wrong
they
go
through
this
period

advanced
despite

about

after

he
say
minute
of
these
meeting
go
to
member
of

ask
whether
gilbertson
have
discuss
the
rio

with
him
at
any
point
during
follow
the
danesfield
meeting
john
jackson
reply
yes
brian
never
have
any
doubt
about
the
industrial
logic
of
a
merger
i
think
he
be
pretty
certain
that
it
would
be
strongly
block
by
don
partly
because
of
the
don
s
australian
blood
meanwhile
gilbertson
be
spending
much
of
his
spare
time
keep
in
shape
i
bought
my
most
expensive
bike
in
melbourne
and
i
use
to
go
cycling
he
say
they
have
an
around
the
bay
race
which
happens
once
a
year
in
october
it
s
kilometre
which
be
a
serious
bike
ride
at
least
for
me
i
agree
to
do
one
leg
of
it
kilometre
and
get
someone
to
come
and
take
me
back
but
it
didn
t
work
that
way
there
be
suppose
to
be
a
bus
that
brought
me
back
but
when
i
get
there
the
bus
be
go
to
be
another
six
hour
so
i
cycle
back
i
do
the
whole
bloody
kilometre
and
i
nearly
die
on
october
there
be
a
farewell
party
in
melbourne
for
paul
anderson
then
a
week
later
gilbertson
give
an
address
entitle
invest
in
risky
geography
to
member
of
the
melbourne
mining
club
in
which
he
turn
conventional
wisdom
on
its
head
by
demonstrate
that
invest
in
politically
stable
place
such
as
the
united
state
magma
could
be
more
dangerous
to
shareholder
than
investment
in
country
that
apparently
epitomise
risk
such
as
mozambique
the
first
mozal
aluminium
smelter
or
chile
the
escondida
copper
mine
i
be
still
try
to
dampen
investor
and
press
concern
that
the
merger
have
trade
good
safe
bhp
asset
for
risky
billiton
one
he
say
the
strategy
be
to
direct
bhp
s
hard
cash
into
billiton
generate
project
with
the
goal
of
achieve
a
per
cent
return
on
a
capital
investment
of
us
billion
and
thus
double
the
company
s
earnings
there
be
many
clue
in
gilbertson
s
exposition
to
his
think
and
it
set
the
hare
run
bhp
billiton
s
balance
sheet
and
cash
flow
have
be
so
healthy
that
he
could
afford
to
mount
a
us
billion
takeover
bid
without
raise
a
sweat
the
question
be
which
way
would
he
jump
acquisition
or
merger
there
be
also
the
question
of
the
composition
of
the
board
which
have
be
slimmed
down
from
director
to
just
two
of
whom
gilbertson
and
goodyear
would
be
executive
derek
key
have
turn
have
already
depart
and
john
jackson
who
be
three
year
old

be
the
next
to
go
the
last
thing
i
do
for
billiton
jackson
say
be
on
monday
november
when
we
have
the

we

the

the
follow

the
gilbertsons
be
at
flemington
to
watch
medium
puzzle
win
the
melbourne
cup
there
be
no
visible
squall
on
the
horizon
but
a
few
short
week
hence
the
medium
would
be
puzzle
over
what
exactly
have
happen
to
cause
a
sudden
and
traumatic
breakdown
in
the
relationship
between
the
south
african
chief
executive
and
his
australian
chairman
for
in
that
short
period
project
would
hit
the
rock
and
sink
leave
wreckage
scatter
through
the
corporate
surf
it
have
all
seem
so
hopeful
there
be
agreement
between
the
negotiator
that
one
of
the
iron
ore
asset
own
by
the
bhpb
and
rio
might
have
to
be
sacrifice
if
government

raise
objection
that
would
bring
the
value
of
the
merge
entity
down
below
the
us
billion
mark
but
it
would
still
be
close
to
it
in
the
early
stage
bob
wilson
talk
about
bring
in
a
third
party
to
take
the
oil
and

asset
indeed
lord
renwick
still
believe
that
in
the
event
of
a
combination
rio
would
have
want
to
see
the
oil
and
gas
business
spun
off
however
brian
gilbertson
maintains
that
bhp
petroleum
would
have
remain
an
integral
part
of
the
merge
company
s
diversified
portfolio
gilbertson
say
he
be
willing
to
stand
down
as
chief
executive
but
it
be
agree
that
he
would
become
chief
executive
of
the
merge
company
with
year
old
adelaide
born

in
that
the

officer
s
job
would
revert
to
an
australian
for
the
first
time
since

have
step
down
in
clifford
train
as
a
mining
engineer
before
join

clifford
return
to

for
several
year
but
found
himself
back
in
london
in
and
in
be
promote
to
chief
executive
the
question
of
gilbertson
s
successor
be
decide
at
a
meeting
between
the
party
in
melbourne
on
november
there
be
however
governance
issue
about
the
composition
of
the
board
to
be
finalise
the
scene
then
switch
to
london
where
on
november
brian
gilbertson
and
bob
wilson
held
a
crucial
rendezvous
prior
to
the
bhp
billiton
board
meeting
the
follow
day
accord
to
gilbertson
wilson
saw
the
merger
as
an
attractive
opportunity
and
felt
that
if
it
could
not
be
do
now
it
would
never
be
do
as
he
plan
to
retire
shortly
he
would
not
seek
the
role
of
chairman
of
the
merge
company
which
raise
the
question
of
who
would
become
chairman
not
don
argus
apparently
his
strident
view
that
rtz
have
pinch
cra
would
not
have
endear
him
to
rio
s
upper
echelon
in
st
james
s
square
the
chairmanship
be
an
issue
gilbertson
say
and
the
rio
director
be
also
concerned
to
see
that
the
synergy
we
have
promise
would
be
deliver
that
night
gilbertson
told
don
argus
who
have
just
arrive
in
london
that
rio
tinto
be
prepared
to
return
to
australia
or
in
his
emotive
phrase
the
prodigal
son
come
home
project
be
still
extant
the
follow
day
november
when
chip
goodyear
report
to
the
board
at
its
meeting
at
bhp
billiton
s
ultra
modern
london
headquarters
at
neathouse
place
victoria
on
the
shareholder
value
that
would
be
release
in
a
merger
with
rio
tinto
gilbertson
told
the
meeting
that
gresham
partner
have
be
retain
to
report
on
financial
issue
bob
wilson
s
point
of
concern
be
list
under
four
heading
petroleum
anti
trust
synergy
people
the
board
agree
that
project
have
merit
brian
report
to
the
board
that
he
d
talk
to
bob
wilson
about
a
combination
lord
renwick
say
but
i
think
he
trigger
this
discussion
of
merge
with
rio
too
soon
and
also
on
a
basis
which
wasn
t
go
to
be
acceptable
to
the
australian
side
and
that
lead
to
this
eruption
renwick
confirm
that
rio
tinto
have
want
a
new
chairman
this
be
unattractive
to
don
it
be
unattractive
to
the
australian
director
he
say
the
rest
of
us
be
not
against
a
merger
with
rio
we
could
see
the
benefit
but
it
be
raise
in
a
very
abrupt
way
there
be
nothing
wrong
intrinsically
with
the
brian
vision
raise
in
the
way
it
be
i
thought
there
be
an
inevitable
difference
of
opinion
which
be
bound
to
develop
because
the
non
australian
director
for
the
most
part
could
see
the
attraction
of
this
thing
but
everybody
be
influence
by
where
they
come
from
so
the
australian
director
naturally
be
less
impressed
and
of
course
there
be
a
long
history
of
not
very
good
relationship
between
bhp
and
rio
over
the
rio
acquisition
of
cra
and
also
tussle
about
iron
ore
in
western
australia
there
be
a
feel
in
australia
that
cra
be
suppose
to
be
in
a
merger
with
rio
but
it
end
up
effectively
be
a
rio
takeover
i
do
hear
from
both
side
that
there
have
be
a
fair
amount
of
friction
between
old
bhp
and
rio
that
even
gilbertson
and
argus
come
face
to
face
again
when
the
director
attend
a
farewell
party
for
john
jackson
at
the
design
museum
on
the
thames
opposite
the
tower
of
london
we
d
have
the
board
meeting
gilbertson
say
and
the
major
issue
be
the
top
two
post
in
the
merge
company
ceo
and
chairman
bob
wilson
be
not
look
for
either
position
and
i
be
prepared
to
step
down
but
don
say
he
be
not
prepared
to
be
trade
the
man
most
favour
to
take
the
chairmanship
we
can
reveal
be
year
old
bhp
billiton
director
michael
chaney
the
perth
born
son
of
sir
fred

and
the
united

concurrently

director
of
wesfarmers
and
a
director
of
gresham

he
be
one
of
the
star
of
the
australian
business
community
at
the
design
museum
amid
the
clink
of
champagne
glass
and
the
buzz
of
social
chatter
gilbertson
and
argus
agree
to
meet
the
follow
day
to
discus
how
to
conduct
the
negotiation
with
rio
and
to
define
the
boundary
of
future
negotiation
however
argus
have
not
be
a
party
to
the
talk
to
date
and
he
make
it
clear
to
gilbertson
that
he
have
no
intention
of
yield
his
position
as
he
have
say
at
the
board
meeting
why
not
make
the
ceo
the
lightning
rod
and
not
the
chairman
he
also
want
to
see
bhp
billiton
properly
bed
down
before
make
any
more
big
play
john
jackson
recall
that
gilbertson
seem
unhappy
at
the
party
although
he
be
unaware
of
the
reason
without
inform
gilbertson
don
argus
then
call
bob
wilson
i
suggest
to
bob
that
in
the
world
i
come
from
normally
chairman
to
chairman
sit
down
and
talk
about
any
propose
merger
argus
say
and
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
if
he
and
i
sat
down
and
talk
about
this
particular
initiative
on
november
argus
met
wilson
that
s
when
the
thing
all
start
to
unfold
argus
say
then
i
have
a
phone
call
with
mr
gilbertson
and
it
probably
would
have
be
one
of
the
most
unpleasant
phone
call
i
ve
ever
have
in
my
life
ask
to
describe
the
content
of
the
call
don
argus
lean
back
in
his
chair
in
the
copper
room
oh
i
won
t
go
down
that
path
he
say
clearly
there
have
be
some
discussion
about
a
potential
merger
with
rio
and
bhp
billiton
at
the
time
but
not
many
of
the
board
member
be
privy
to
those
discussion
brian
gilbertson
say
he
have
always
be
conscious
of
the
need
to
take
board
member
with
him
in
every
merger
and
acquisition
situation
i
briefed
don
argus
after
every
meeting
with
rio
and
the
board
at
every
board
meeting
he
say
i
also
do
the
occasional
note
for
the
board
maybe
i
should
have
phone
every
board
member
after
every
meeting
with
bob
wilson
say
mike
salamon
the
most
challenge
part
of
these
big
deal
be
what
they
call
social
issue
the
social
issue
be
the
key
board
member
and
the
key
executive
what
happens
to
them
and
how
be
they
perceive
in
history
those
be
very
important
thing
at
the
time
of
do
a
deal
you
have
some
pretty
big
personality
around
the
table
who
be
not
always
go
to
agree
about
thing
gilbertson
then
phone
bob
wilson
who
told
him
that
don
argus
do
not
have
much
enthusiasm
for
a
deal
that
he
wasn
t
up
for
it
and
that
he
felt
the
whole
thing
be
too
hard
the
big
merger
in
the
industry
s
history
have
effectively
be
torpedoed
it
be
in
the
bag
we
would
have
be
hero
in
australia
gilbertson
say
we
hadn
t
write
the
agreement
but
everything
point
in
the
right
direction
under
different
circumstance
i
think
don
would
have
be
in
favour
of
the
deal
by
time
and
geography
have
not
quite
succeed
in
merge
the
endeavour
of
brian
gilbertson
and
sir
robert
wilson
but
physically
they
be
indeed
very
close
wilson
be
work
as
chairman
of
the
bg
group
formerly
british
gas
at
jermyn
street
just
a
couple
of
block
from
gilbertson
s
pallinghurst
resource
at
no
in
the
same
street
a
fluke
that
both
men
found
amuse
the
smart
but
totally
anonymous
office
of
the
bg
group
be
sandwich
between
a
men
s
outfitter
and
a
shoe
shop
wilson
s
spacious
sixth
floor
office
overlook
piccadilly
he
be
of
medium
height
a
dapper
dresser
with
neatly
brush
grey
fleck
hair
blue
checked
shirt
autumnal
tie
light
tweed
suit
he
have
vowed
not
to
talk
about
bhp
billiton
but
aware
of
his
role
in
these
momentous
event
he
relents
and
discus
them
for
the
first
time
ask
whether
brian
gilbertson
have
approach
him
in
july
about
the
possibility
of
a
merger
between
rio
tinto
and
bhp
billiton
he
reply
yes
gilbertson
seem
to
think
those
talk
be
go
quite
well
would
that
be
your
take
on
it
yes
there
be
a
crucial
bhp
billiton
board
meeting
in
london
in
november
when
don
argus
be
apprise
of
the
fact
that
possibly
a
change
of
chairmanship
be
in
the
off
we
understand
he
contact
you
and
be
somewhat
abrupt
wilson
laugh
heartily
be
that
a
fair
summary
that
s
a
fair
summary
there
be
another
name
mention
in
term
of
the
chairmanship
michael
chaney
would
that
also
be
a
reasonable
thing
to
say
not
as
a
part
of
any
discussion
i
have
brian
gilbertson
insists
chaney
s
name
be
in
fact
discuss
but
a
new
chairman
would
have
be
a
requirement
if
the
combination
have
proceed
umm
i
m
not
sure
that
the
conversation
have
really
get
that
far
quite
honestly
how
far
have
it
get
i
think
that
it
be
begin
to
touch
on
some
of
those
question
who
s
go
to
be
do
which
job
it
be
fairly
close
to
when
i
intend
to
retire
i
told
both
brian
and
my
own
board
that
i
didn
t
intend
to
have
this
become
the
basis
for
me
stay
on
if
it
go
ahead
and
that
cause
some
problem
with
my
own
board
well
we
don
t
think
you
should
be
do
this
unless
you
commit
to
stay
on
to
see
it
through
be
the
view
of
some
of
them
this
be
not
a
discussion
i
d
have
with
brian
at
that
point
and
there
be
also
issue
if
it
be
go
to
be
a
bhp
condition
a
don
argus
condition
not
a
brian
gilbertson
condition
about
where
the
head
office
of
this
company
should
be
locate
i
think
that
be
go
to
be
a
problem
the
head
office
should
be
where
the
head
office
should
be
the
rio
board
would
have
prefer
it
to
be
in
london
not
necessarily
i
d
spent
quite
a
lot
of
time
think
about
a
number
of
alternative
one
of
which
be
sydney
none
of
which
be
melbourne
one
of
which
would
have
be
the
west
coast
of
the
state
basically
in
my
view
there
be
three
option
one
would
have
be
sydney
one
would
have
be
london
and
a
third
would
have
be
somewhere
like
san
francisco
i
don
t
think
i
d
have
that
discussion
with
brian
i
can
t
be
certain
whether
i
do
or
not
actually
because
it
s
quite
a
long
time
ago
brian
gilbertson
seem
to
think
there
be
scope
for
movement
that
the
head
office
could
move
from
london
for
me
it
s
a
pragmatic
decision
where
be
go
to
be
the
best
place
to
run
the
business
why
sydney
not
melbourne
i
see
sydney
as
be
more
outward
look
well
communication
also
to
the
outside
world
melbourne
would
be
consider
to
be
the
traditional
home
of
the
mining
company
yes
but
it
s
not
particularly
well
connect
to
the
rest
of
the
world
there
be
now
a
notably
different
quality
of
transport
availability
out
of
sydney
compare
with
melbourne
it
hasn
t
always
be
quite
as
notable
as
it
be
today
also
i
think
if
the
two
company
be
to
get
together
there
be
some
merit
in
an
entirely
new
location
it
seem
the
idea
be
that
brian
gilbertson
would
stay
for
a
little
while
if
this
happen
and
that
leigh
clifford
would
then

among

that

lack
the

to

retire

not
due
to
join
the

until
february
don
argus
call
for
order
recall
the
event
he
be
typically
succinct
it
be
a
specially
convene
board
meeting
to
establish
how
we
be
go
to
run
the
organisation
go
forward
he
say
in
fact
the
proposition
before
the
director
be
not
about
the
rio
tinto
merger
at
all
but
rather
that
the
chief
executive
should
be
dismiss
consider
the
issue
at
stake
it
be
a
fairly
low
key
event
there
be
no
loss
of
temper
no
intemperate
language
david
brink
who
follow
the
proceeding
at
the
end
of
a
telephone
line
say
the
meeting
address
the
issue
that
have
give
rise
to
the
difference
between
gilbertson
and
the
board
difference
that
first
become
evident
at
the
november
board
meeting
in
london
in
a
cordial
and
professional
manner
i
could
understand
perfectly
well
that
the
board
didn
t
want
to
do
the
rio
transaction
in
this
way
say
lord
renwick
who
be
in
cape
town
but
i
thought
that
rather
than
simply
dismiss
the
ceo
the
board
should
say
to
him
this
be
what
we
want
and
you
now
have
six
month
to
prove
yourself
to
us
he
d
only
be
there
six
month
cor
herkstr
ter
and
i
take
the
view
that
rather
than
dismiss
brian
there
should
be
a
conversation
with
him
about
what
the
board
expect
when
it
come
to
a
vote
renwick
s
and
herkstr
ter
s
be
the
only
voice
raise
in
opposition
to
gilbertson
s
dismissal
david
brink
side
with
his
chairman
the
aussie
director
be
all
very
much
in
the
same
position
and
no
doubt
have
talk
to
each
other
beforehand
as
be
david
jenkins
who
be
the
english
director
on
the
old
bhp
board
lord
renwick
say
don
argus
and
another
director
john
schubert
go
down
to
gilbertson
s
office
and
told
him
the
director
have
read
his
memorandum
and
although
the
board
be
not
unanimous
he
do
not
have
the
support
of
the
majority
gilbertson
say
he
have
the
feel
that
argus
be
invite
him
to
jump
ship
or
be
push
he
insist
on
see
the
director
himself
so
at
pm
the
trio
trooped
up
to
the
boardroom
where
the
south
african
come
face
to
face
with
the
men
who
have
seal
his
fate
nobody
seem
to
want
to
add
anything
to
the
bland
statement
that
the
board
do
not
support
his
position
in
effect
dismiss
him
as
the
company
s
high
paid
executive
don
argus
then
invite
the
chief
executive
to
address
the
director
gilbertson
have
prepared
a
little
speech
he
told
them
that
he
have
act
in
the
best
interest
of
the
shareholder
and
have
kept
the
board
fully
inform
about
project
they
have
create
a
great
company
together
and
he
be
very
sorry
to
be
leave
he
wish
them
well
in
the
future
and
want
them
all
to
remember
that
he
personally
held
more
share
in
bhp
billiton

rest
of
them
put
together

work
for
the
success

because
he
d
be
a
ceo
not
in
the
mining
industry
but
in
a

understood
that
very
well
that
as
a
chairman
or
a
director
you
should
try
to
work
out
what
your
real
role
be
and
make
sure
you
do
that
very
well
don
t
try
to
get
into
the

or
try
to
second
guess
management
the
fascinate
thing
which
again
demonstrates
just
how
important
board

be

not
be
that
the

go

all
the

despite
what
be
go
on
with
paul
go
then
brian
go
then
chip
come
what
it
demonstrates
be
that
the
board
and
the
ceo
in
such
a
big
company
be
irrelevant
in
the
short
term
it
s
like
a

the

decision
turn
the

it
take
mile
for
that
to
happen
in
big
company
you
measure
it
in
year
not
month
or
quarter
so
all
of
that
be
go
on

the

kept
on
do
what
it
be
suppose

brad

who
have
already

time
over
the
wisdom
of
cut
back

to
avoid
swamp
the
market
with
the

and
to
foster
a

a
tactic
that
have
contribute
to
a
per

increase
in
the
copper
group

i
tend
to
be

on

than
chip
chip
be
a
little
more
finance
orient
a
little
bit
more
conservative
perhaps
so
sometimes
we
cross
sword
on
certain
key
issue
i
have
to
report
to
chip
and
found
it
difficult
there
be
huge
pressure
on
cost
in
the
copper
business
against
the
price
environment
which
be
extremely
difficult
to
operate
in
the
fall
in
copper
price
to
a
month
low
in
november
have
brought
matter
to
a
head
in
order
to
end
the
cyclical
boom
to
bust
pattern
of
the
past
brad
mill
have
argue
that
copper
output
should
be
curtail
at
escondida
and
the
company
s
other
copper
mine
we
can
t
just
keep
pump
copper
out
into
this
marketplace
he
say
i
don
t
care
if
we
re
the

we

it

in

if

it
s
a

to
break
however
beneath

ivy
league
image
the
company
be
convulse
as
it
struggle

transform
itself
from

and
goodyear
s
quality
would
be
test
to
the
limit
early
on
in
the
ceo
role
one
of
the
executive
say
to
me
what
s
your
vision
for
this
company
he
recall
i
thought
about
it
for
a
while
and
i
say
i
see
an
entity
that
creates
a
return
on
capital
that
be
the
high
of
all
our
industry
peer
and
the
guy
say
to
me
that
s
wonderful
what
be
you
go
to
tell
the
other
per
cent
of
the
people
who
work
here
it
brought
him
up
short
suddenly
he
realise
that
he
have
not
be
train
for
the
role
when
you
get
to
be
ceo
you
ve
get
to
put
away
what
you
know
on
most
skill
set
somebody
else
have
to
do
that
he
found
people
management
tough
early
as
most
ceo
do
don
argus
say
but
he
be
able
to
get
around
that
and
he
developed
a
rally
call
and
people
start
to
follow
him
very
well
paul
try
to
set
up
an
open
door
culture
and
try
to
get
people
to
engage
and
chip
follow
that
and
i
thought
that
be
a
good
sign
of
a
potential
leader
of
the
future
he
be
fortunate
to
have
mike
salamon
who
accord
to
lord
renwick
be
the
best
operation
guy
in
this
business
mike
be
very
complementary
to
chip
goodyear
because
chip
have
a
first
class
financial
brain
and
risk
evaluation
but
be
not
the
guy
who
s
go
to
fix
problem
on
no
shaft
he
say
mike
be
a
real
hard
hat
character
who
go
to
the
mine
and
see
what
s
wrong
with
it
and
fix
it
he
s
a
legendary
figure
in
the
industry
as
a
hand
on

however
there
be

so
when

that
a

the

could
have

the

you
can
t
necessarily
judge
the

that
happen
but
you
can
judge
the

on
how
it
reacts
to
those
thing
when
commissioner
cole
report
on
november
press
coverage
concentrate
overwhelmingly
on
the
finding
against
the
awb
figure
most
deeply
entwine
in
the
deception
cole
found
that
awb
executive
may
have
broken
australian
law
he
make
no
adverse
finding
against

however
the

found
that
ndk

charles

who
work

before

after
his
time
with

may
have
broken
australian
law
on
the
evidence
before
me
cole
conclude
mr
davidson
kelly
be
a
thoroughly
disreputable
man
with
no
commercial
morality
astonishingly
when
goodyear
release
the
internal
review
into
the
affair
in

it
reveal
that

both
arrangement
in
the
light
of
the
finding
of

the

found
that
john
prescott
have
make
a
prudent
and
sensible
decision
on
how
to
proceed
with
the
wheat

moreover
no

in

with
the
make
of
the
wheat
shipment
by
breaching
a
particular
policy
or
by
breaching
standard
of
business
conduct
nevertheless
in
the
interim
bhp
billiton
have
make
a
considerable
number
of
enhancement
to
its
practice
and
process
that
it
believe
well
protect
the

from
the
risk
of
this
kind
of

damage
these
include

nominal

catch
bhp

where
we

in

quite
clearly
we

change
from
a

where
we
operate
really

what
i

try

these

liquefy

east

the

then
join

objective
in

we
ve
get
a
split
in
iraq
where
it
s
per
cent
shell
and
per
cent
ourselves
and
we
would
work
thing
jointly
yeager
say
we
re
wait
for
the
iraqi
to
establish
the
rule
of
law
so
that
if
we
invest
in
certain
way
then
we
will
be
remunerate
so
right
now
the
hydrocarbon
law
and
the
entire
framework
for
the
oil

gas
business
be
be
rework
as
a
result
of
the
new

the
other
major
obstacle
be
the
security
on
the
ground
when
that
be
good
enough
we
can
send
people
in
and
feel
confident
they
ll
be
safe
we
view
iraq
as
a
substantial
opportunity
but
one
that
quite
clearly
could
be
a
number
of
year
away
depend
on
how
thing
go
we
visit
with
the
iraqi
all
the
time
and
we
continue
to
show
our
interest
but
obviously
we
re
wait
for
the
rule
to
get
clarify
and
the
security
to
get
well

the

we

he

the

be
that
the

have
make

so
how
do
we

we

factor
the

would
result
in
great

this
be
ironic
in

from

of

cottage
have
foster
a

he
confront
the
political
nature
of
the

the

deep
assumption
be
that
the

be
inherently

immutably
bias
against

that
we
should
respond
with

vehemence
i
decide
i
d
see
what
happen
if
i
abandon
this
prejudice
how
could
we
work
with
the

with
the

and
possibly
work
with

soon
afterwards
graham
evans
flew
me
down
from
boston
for
dinner
in
washington
dc
to
talk
about
possibility
it
be
a
congenial
occasion
and
there
be
an
assumption
that
they
would
continue
to
talk
after

in
he
be

the

rather
than
in
the

at

house
a
fundamental
political
error
he
have
not
appreciate
either
the
importance
of
propinquity
to
the
source
of

the

or
the
paranoia
of

under

soon
be
from

hill
snap
forget
about
it
only
six
month
later
do
i
learn
from

that
i
d
have
a
major
fall
out
with

because
hill
have
cut
me
off
so
do
other
friend

much
to
my
disappointment
it
become
clear
that
i
would
have
to
spend
some
time
in
the
political
wilderness
however
he
now
have
the
opportunity
to
pursue

of
the
big

interest
so
the
government
particularly
the
cabinet
be
receive
the
same
message
from
both
side
not
surprisingly
perhaps
the
result
be
spectacular
in
short
order
the
cabinet
decide
secretly
not
to
ratify
kyoto
without
the
united
state
in
the
howard
government
announce
it
would
not
pursue
emission
trading
until
at
least
on
world
environment
day
in
june
prime
minister
howard
told
parliament
that
australia
do
not
intend
to
ratify
the
kyoto
protocol
in
a
government
white
paper
reveal
no
greenhouse
reduction
target
post
kyoto
no
emission
trading
ahead
of
effective
global
action
and
a
hobble
of
the
renewable
energy
industry
the
final
triumph
for
aign
come
in
when
the
government
announce
the
establishment
of
the
asia
pacific
partnership
on
clean
development
and
climate
ap
pearse
say
the
ap
cover
country
responsible
for
more
than
per
cent
of
global
emission
include
china
india
and
the
us
but
do
not
require
anyone
to
reduce
emission
or
even
slow
their
increase
at
the
same
time
pearse
continued
consult
work
for
bhp
billiton
and
he
and
his
wife
share
a
canberra
house
with
senator
brandis
a
classmate
of
tom
harley
s
at
oxford
who
have
become
a
prominent
supporter
of
treasurer
peter
costello
for
the
prime
ministership
for
a
time
bhp
billiton
hq
in
melbourne
also
sought
my
advice
on
the
company
s
relation
with
the
howard
government
in
general
pearse
say
they
be
particularly
interested
in
my
good
relationship
with
mp
close
to
costello
obviously
in
anticipation
of
a
possible
leadership
transition
one
consequence
be
his
introduction
to
the
man
graham
evans
have
appoint
the
company
s
vice
president
of
government
relation
and
asset
protection
bernie
delaney
my
first
impression
pearse
say
be
that
he
be
cluey
but
not
half
as
intimidate
as
i
would
have
expect
they
frequently
do
the
round
of
ministerial
office
seek
government
subsidy
for
company
project
more
than
once
i
saw
him
bite
his
tongue
and
bide
his
time
so
as
not
to
risk
antagonise
a
petulant
minister
they
be
paid
on
result
i
sat
with
senior
bhp
billiton
people
outside
aussie
s
caf
in
parliament
house
one
day
and
remember
them
explain
to
me
how
they
receive
personal
bonus
on
the
basis
of
whether
they
secure
government
funding
in
pearse
accepted
a
retainer
from
delaney
to
provide
advice
directly
to
him
on
the
company
s
broad
relation
with
the
federal
government
the
focus
of
the
company
s
continue
campaign
he
say
be
support
for
the
big
australian
it
be
not
always
an
easy
sell
how
do
we
convince
the
federal
government
that
we
be
still
the
big
australian
even
though
anyone
look
closely
can
see
that
we
be
nothing
like
as
australian
nowadays
he
say
most
of
the
shareholder
be
overseas
most
of
the
project
be
overseas
most
of
the
board
and
if
it
weren
t
for
the
window
dress
hq
would
probably
be
in
london
too
so
what
can
we
do
to
maintain
the
political
capital
associate
with
be
the
big
australian
that
be
my
work
focus
on
the
financial
contribution
to
regional
australia
the
employment
contribution
the
indirect
job
create
by
the
company
s
activity
here
and
the
large
indirect
stake
many
australian
have
in
the
company
through
their
superannuation
fund
my
impression
be
that
the
company
be
completely
accustom
to
use
the
big
australian
moniker
to
their
political
advantage
they
also
weren
t
shy
about
ignore
it
either
effectively
threaten
to
take
their
business
offshore
unless
government
chipped
in
sentiment
when
it
suit
a
whiff
of
economic
blackmail
when
it
didn
t
however
later
that
year
the
contract
terminate
very
suddenly
delaney
claimed
the
reason
be
a
cost
cut
decree
from
chief
executive
officer
brian
gilbertson
but
pearse
be
not
convince
it
come
in
the
wake
of
a
long
conversation
between
delaney
and
prime
minister
howard
s
chief
of
staff
arthur
sinodinos
at
the
liberal
party
s
federal
conference
i
suspect
it
be
to
do
with
bernie
s
assessment
that
howard
be
stay
he
say
so
pearse
s
costello
contact
be
less
important
by
then
he
suspect
delaney
might
well
have
begin
to
be
concerned
about
his
greenhouse
view
however
the
termination
be
relatively
cordial
and
he
continued
to
lobby
for
government
support
of
the
company
s
yabalu
nickel
refinery
near
townsville
and
saw
delaney
from
time
to
time
bernie
delaney
be
a
season
political
poker
player
he
say
he
knew
what
my
phd
research
be
about
and
he
knew
my
green
for
a
liberal
view
on
kyoto
so
in
hindsight
i
think
this
flavour
our
discussion
on
kyoto
and
emission
trading
he
give
me
the
impression
that
the
company
be
ambivalent
about
these
thing
and
be
far
more
ready
than
say
john
howard
to
accept
kyoto
and
price
carbon
however
i
also
know
that
the
aluminium
side
of
the
business
be
in
the
thick
of
the
lobbying
against
both
and
bhpb
be
also
closely
involve
in
most
of
the
politick
by
the
mineral
council
of
australia
against
them
too
far
they
be
among
those
hire
andrew
robb
to
lobby
against
kyoto
more
recently
they
have
say
they
can
slow
the
growth
in
their
own
emission
but
that
it
s
unreasonable
for
a
company
grow
as
fast
as
them
to
be
expect
to
achieve
absolute
reduction
in
greenhouse
emission
in
the
foreseeable
future
on
balance
for
them
to
say
something
like
that
as
recently
as
suggests
that
the
moral
imperative
just
doesn
t
register
geoff
walsh
say
that
bernie
delaney
remain
the
principal
in
house
lobbyist
to
government
bernie
delaney
report
to
me
but
he
s
the
person
who
principally
look
after
government
relation
at
the
federal
level
all
side
of
politics
and
the
federal
bureaucracy
when
ask
his
attitude
to
carbon
emission
and
climate
change
marius
kloppers
pause
for
a
moment
we
participate
in
the
coal
and
future
gen
project
he
say
i
suspect
though
that
the
electricity
generation
industry
which
be
multiple
multiple
multiple
time
the
size
of
the
energy
coal
industry
will
ultimately
have
the
big
vested
interest
to
drive
those
change
change
in
fuel
switch
be
largely
make
by
generator
not
by
the
people
who
supply
them
the
company
s
policy
on
climate
change
be
pretty
clear
it
go
out
from
the
premise
that
the
science
be
real
that
co
concentration
in
the
atmosphere
be
an
issue
and
must
be
stabilise
so
we
favour
policy
that
price
the
external
cost
of
carbon
base
fuel
what
be
important
be
to
reduce
the
carbon
content
of
the
atmosphere
in
reality
that
will
be
driven
by
the
large
economy
and
any
attempt
that
be
not
squarely
aim
at
building
a
global
community
to
influence
that
be
likely
to
have
very
little
impact
basically
the
world
be
in
a
prisoner
s
dilemma
at
the
moment
on
global
warm
everybody
be
look
at
everybody
else
because
people
be
try
to
set
target
for
something
that
be
a
hundred
year
time
frame
in
my
personal
opinion
the
real
endeavour
have
get
to
be
to
get
start
across
as
broad
a
base
as
possible
not
to
out
cut
each
other
because
in
reality
if
one
party
make
a
very
aggressive
set
of
cut
you
re
less
likely
to
get
international
cooperation
you
re
more
likely
to
get
a
global
set
of
issue
if
you
just
get
start
in
a
modest
way
and
continue
to
then
build
the
broad
base
and
only
after
you
ve
built
the
broad
base
do
i
think
you
can
really
start
influence
for
a
hundred
year
time
frame
don
argus
also
measure
his
word
carefully
i
have
a
very
strong
view
about
the
climate
change
debate
but
i
need
to
be
careful
that
i
don
t
pre
empt
the
policy
the
company
have
he
say
i
don
t
believe
that
you
can
go
in
isolation
with
emission
trading
he
be
concerned
that
the
government
would
use
the
revenue
from
emission
permit
to
pick
winner
or
subsidise
renewable
energy
initiative
that
be
not
economic
if
that
occur
australia
would
not
get
the
full
benefit
from
the
emission
trading
scheme
i
read
the
science
he
say
i
read
all
the
article
and
i
read
the
sceptical
environmentalist
and
there
s
enough
data
in
there
that
would
allow
me
to
say
yes
i
query
it
but
intuitively
see
stuff
spew
up
in
the
air
i
m
aghast
that
we
re
not
bring
on
the
uranium
debate
here
in
australia
i
m
absolutely
aghast
there
s
only
one
solution
to
save
the
ecosystem
of
the
world
and
that
s
uranium

of

as
a
clean
alternative
to

opposition
leader
kevin
rudd

respond
with
a

that
the

would
build
nuclear
power
station
around
the
country
at
the
same
time
however
labor
reaffirm
its

for

the

mine
at
south
australia

drop
its

fact
accord
to
guy
pearse
mining
all
that
extra
clean
green
uranium
at
roxby
down
will
reportedly
generate
an
estimate
five
million
more
tonne
of
greenhouse
gas
annually
roughly
add
one
per
cent
to
australia
s
emission
or
the
equivalent
to
about
another
million
car
on
our
road
such
concern
be
far
from
the
mind
of
the
two
men
meeting
at
london
s
sheraton
park
tower
at
knightsbridge
in
mid
october
the

be
an
undistinguished
concrete

glass
structure
on
the
west
london
skyline
but
its
lack
of
architectural
grace
be
more
than
redeem
in
the
eye
of
some
visitor
by
its
proximity
to
the
shopping
mecca
of
harrod
and
harvey
nichols
and
mick
davis
have
shopping
very
much
on
his
mind
when
he
drop
in
for
breakfast
with
andrew
michelmore
chief
executive
of

since
walk

from

fail
miserably
shortly
after

with
the
help
of
marc

who
have
depart
bhp

in

davis
successfully
list
xstrata
on
the
london
stock
exchange
in
march
two
year
later
his
extremely
small
team

just
people
work
from
the
basement
of
j
p
morgan
s
office
near
blackfriar
bridge
have
grown
xstrata
into
a
us
billion
company
over
the
croissant

michelmore

of
an
old
melbourne
family
and
davis
the
hard
drive
south
african
size
one
another
up
that
be
the
first
time
i
spoke
to
andrew
davis
say
speak
about
the
wmc
battle
for
the
first
time
i
indicate
to
him
at
that
stage
that
i
be
interested
in
put
the
two
company
together
but
i
didn
t
table
a
transaction
since
virtually
every
major
mining
company
in
australia
have
be
take
over
by
foreign
interest
indeed
davis
have
stun
the
mining
world
with
his
purchase
of
mim
holding
for
billion
in
after
a
year
long
battle
with
its
recalcitrant
shareholder
mount
isa
mine
be
one
of
the
great
corporate
battle
davis
say
although
the
board
support
us
the
management
didn
t
and
the
management
found
way
to
fight
us
which
use
australian
corporate
law
very
ingeniously
if
you
have
shareholder
and
own
one
per
cent
of
the
company
and
own
per
cent
those
could
stop
the
thing
go
ahead
so
we
nearly
lose
that
the
whole
of
australia
be
against
xstrata
it
seem
to
be
swiss
gnome
back
by
nefarious
shady
people
i
get
email
to
take
my
nazi
gold
and
go
home
it
be
really
a
very
messy
thing
but
we
won
that
and
that
transaction
actually
make
xstrata
it
be
crucial
indeed
the
deal
have
turn
xstrata
into
the
world
s
large
exporter
of
coal
for
heat
and
power
now
davis
yearn

out
xstrata
slap
on

his

have
no
hesitation
in
reject
the

as
too
low
so
xstrata
announce
it
would
take
it
directly
to
wmc
s
shareholder
we
make
an
approach
to
the
western
mining
board
they
reject
the
approach
we
then
go
hostile
mick
davis
say
davis
s
tactic
be
to
force
potential
rival
bidder
bhp
billiton
rio
tinto
anglo
american
and
vale
of
brazil
into
the
open
i
found
out
because
one
of
our
adviser
be
conflict
that
bhp
in
fact
have
be
study
western
mining
but
hadn
t
do
anything
with
it
he
say
i
suspect
that
if
we
hadn
t
do
anything
they
still
wouldn
t
have
do
anything
i
take
it
as
a
great
compliment
that
i
ve
cause
a
number
of
company
to
counter
bid
against
me
i
m
always
pleased
when
i
can
demonstrate
that
there
s
value
when
other
people
can
t
see
it
as
the
quest
for
cheap
mineral
asset
intensified
to
satisfy
demand
in
china
each
company
have
be
study
the
feasibility
of
mount
a
bid
for
wmc
under
australian
takeover
rule
however
xstrata
could
block
rival
bid
if
it
could
acquire
a
stake
in
wmc
of
at
least
ten
per
cent
chip
goodyear
knew
what
davis
be
try
to
do
and
although
he
covet
wmc
s
asset
he
wasn
t
prepared
to
show
his
hand
just
yet
despite
boom
commodity
price
he
be
painfully
aware
that
the
slump
of
the
past
decade
have
almost
cripple
some
mining
company
include
his
own
the
spectre
of
magma
that
have
hung
over
the
executive
suite
at
bourke
street
have
follow
the
big
fella
to
its
new
headquarters
at
lonsdale
street
but
goodyear
be
also
conscious
of
the
fact
that
while
the
rise
australian
dollar
make
wmc
an
increasingly
expensive
target
for
foreign
bidder
it
meant
the
company
be
tailor
make
for
bhp
billiton
and
he
have
a
plan
we
knew
that
whoever
kick
the
ball
off
with
wmc
they
be
go
to
run
the
other
way
he
say
that
s
the
nature
of
acquisition
you
kick
the
ball
off
and
it
doesn
t
matter
who
you
be
the
guy
hate
you
so
we
want
to
be
a
friend
and
be
somebody
they
could
run
to
when
that
ball
be
kick
off
sure
enough
it
do
and
they
say
anybody
but
xstrata
marius
kloppers
have
move
to
melbourne
in
in
a
commercial
role
that
involve
him
in
merger
and
acquisition
in
addition
to
business
development
and
marketing
marius
and
i
developed
a
strategy
that
say
we
need
to
get
close
to
this
company
goodyear
say
marius
developed
relationship
with
the
development
team
over
there
and
so
we
get
to
know
each
other
very
well
recognise
that
there
be
a
great
fit
here
kloppers
concur
we
always
thought
that
wmc
would
auction
itself
he
say
the
auction
would
conclude
and
it
would
be
easy
for
the
party
that
have
be
friendly
towards
western
mining
to
be
in
the
best
position
to
complete
the
transaction

of
kloppers
contact

be
mike
nossal
son
of
sir
gu
nossal
we
d
talk
about
the
nickel
business
quite
a
bit
because
we
felt
our
nickel
business
be
a
bit
sub
scale
and
theirs
be
sub
scale
so
there
be
an
ongoing
series
of
dialogue
on
how
you
could
put
the
two
nickel
business
together
but
without
reach
any
fruitful
outcome
on

andrew

michelmore
urge
shareholder
to
ignore
the
xstrata
bid
because
it
fails
to
recognise
the
current
and
prospective
value
of
wmc

the
statement
warn

against

from

encourage
them
to
only
accept
call
which
be
officially
endorse
by
the
wmc

he
told
the
financial
time
that
while
he
believe
the
company
could
deliver
well
value
to
shareholder
by
stay
independent
he
would
be
happy
to
talk
to
any

who
be
willing
to
offer
a
material
improvement
on

michelmore
say
i
certainly
don
t
blame
mick
for
come
along
and
try
to
pick
us
up
he
be
ahead
of
the
pack
and
he
want
to
pick
us
up
before
others
recognise
what
our
value
be
he
described
olympic
dam
as
a
ginormous
ore
body
and
add
there
be
no
question
that
we
have
the
great
suite
of
base
metal
asset
that
exist
certainly
in
australia
but
probably
anywhere
in
the
world
the
stalemate
be
still
unresolved
in
the
new
year
when
wmc
produce
a
strong
production
statement
for

an
upbeat
assessment
of

ahead
it
have

its

beaten

there
have
be

this
bullish

xstrata
to
raise

us

or
a

wmc
s
board
however
still
decline
to
endorse
the
revise

and
suggest
it
would
seek
a
white
knight
prepared
to
offer
an
even
high
price
chip
goodyear
still
hadn
t
put
his
card
on
the

on

when
he
report
a

billion
pre

profit
for

six
month
to
december
more
than
double
bhp
billiton

interim
figure
he
would
not
be
drawn
on
whether
bhp
be
consider
a
counter
bid
for
wmc
switch
tack
to
discus
the
uncertainty
of
invest
in
russia
s
natural
resource
follow
president
putin
s
sudden
tendency
to
renegotiate
lucrative
contract
sign
in
the
past
with
western
oil
company

in
the
case
of
the
yukos
oil
and
gas
conglomerate
hand
its

over
to
russian
rival
what
i
would
say
be
watch
russia
put
your
toe
in
the
water
but
i
wouldn
t
expect
any
significant

there
he
say
the
issue
be
go
to
be
what
be
your
right
as
the
owner
of
mineral
deposit
by
march
goodyear
be
confident
the
plan
be
work
it
be
time
to
throw
the
knockout
punch
that
afternoon
he
announce
a
bid
of
billion
us
billion
for
wmc
easily
trump
xstrata
s
billion
us
billion
deutsche
bank
act
for
bhpb
have
be
buying
wmc
share
in
the
open
market
for
several
week
and
it
have
become
clear
to
mick
davis
that
the
bank
be
try
to
accumulate
a
per
cent
stake
of
its
own
to
foil
xstrata
s
offer
under
the
takeover
rule
the
bank
have
quietly
offer
a
select
group
of
wmc
shareholder
a
share
in
cash
well
above
xstrata
s
offer
of
and
wmc
s
share
price
of
and
be
close
to
reach
its
target
once
bhpb
secure
its
per
cent
stake
it
would
unveil
a
share
bid
for
the
rest
of
wmc
i
thought
we
played
that
one
pretty
well
don
argus
say
i
think
have
the
support
of
the
western
mining
board
be
a
big
plus
but
i
can
remember
one
uncomfortable
night
when
some
of
our
whizz
kid
adviser
try
to
encourage
us
to
take
up
a
part
position
in
western
mining
and
that
wasn
t
one
of
our
smartest
move
we
be
very
fortunate
that
the
western
mining
board
approve
the
transaction
the
next
afternoon
otherwise
i
reckon
the
uk
market
would
have
have
our
ear
and
everything
for
botching
up
a
partial
bid
yes
it
be
stupid
but
there
you
be
they
survive
it
mick
davis
say
have
bhp
not
come
in
we
would
have
won
it
at
the
price
that
we
offer
i
suspect
they
come
in
because
it
be
incomprehensible
to
don
argus
that
anybody
other
than
bhp
would
own
western
mining
they
would
have
paid
any
price
and
the
minute
they
come
up
with
their
price
i
knew
the
game
be
over
and
i
thought
the
best
strategy
for
me
be
to
withdraw
as
quickly
as
possible
it
take
me
by
surprise
i
didn
t
think
they
would
come
in
think
about
it
afterwards
don
decide
nobody
else
be
go
to
buy
western
mining
and
with
marius
and
mike
salamon
quite
eager
to
do
something
there
be
strong
motivation
i
don
t
think
chip
be
in
favour
of
the
deal
at
all
and
that
s
what
i
be
banking
on
but
the
weight
of
don
marius
and
mike
won
the
day
chip
goodyear
say
we
work
through
a
process
we
stayed
in
the
weed
and
when
we
sprang
out
of
the
weed
within
hour
we
have
an
agree
deal
the
board
of
wmc
resource
advise
shareholder
that
in
the
absence
of
a
high
offer
they
should
accept
bhpb
s
bid
and
once
the
deal
be
do
mike
salamon
replace
tommie
bergman
as
chairman
so
how
do
mick
davis
take
his
defeat
marius
kloppers
flash
a
smile
you
know
i
never
really
discuss
that
with
mick
he
say
i
think
mick
probably
thought
that
he
have
it
they
be
very
close
we
wait
until
the
last
minute
mick
thought
it
be
go
to
be
all
over
in
a
day
or
two
and
i
guess
have
mentally
pencil
in
own
the
asset
by
then
i
have
quite
a
few
discussion
with
his
principal
shareholder
glencore
afterwards
and
clearly
ivan
glazenberg
glencore
s
chief
executive
officer
be
keen
for
mick
to
buy
that
set
of
asset
mick
however
hold
no
grudge
chip
come
to
see
me
a
few
month
later
to
find
out
if
i
be
still
talk
to
him
he
say
i
say
to
him
i
have
no
issue
it
be
entirely
open
to
them
to
bid
against
me
and
they
be
the
big
company
and
have
big
resource
and
that
be
not
a
problem
for
me
they
could
take
a
different
view
on
risk
and
value
than
i
could
take
so
i
have
no
issue
with
that
at
all
that
s
the
name
of
the
game
you
know
what
they
say
in
the
gangster
movie
it
s
just
business
nothing
personal
goodyear
put
the
deal
into
financial
perspective
in
an
interview
with
kerry
o
brien
on
the
abc
s
report
it
s
a
little
over
us
billion
our
current
market
capitalisation
be
about
us
or
us
billion
so
it
s
still
less
than
ten
per
cent
of
bhp
billiton
on
an
overall
basis
it
s
a
very
good
business
it
fit
well
with
us
but
again
it
s
still
relatively
small
in
the
scheme
of
the
entire
enterprise
however
he
knew
that
the
real
significance
lay
in
the
massive
uranium
deposit
he
glowed
when
he
say
in
one
step
we
become
the
industry
s
main
player
in
a
critical
resource
the
glow
become
luminescent
as
the
uranium
price
rise
spectacularly
from
us
per
pound
in
to
more
than
us
five
year
later
profit
soar
the
company
plan
a
huge
expansion
we
have
a
different
view
of
the
future
of
olympic
dam
than
they
have
mick
davis
say
we
be
go
to
expand
and
continue
the
underground
mine
they
be
go
to
cannibalise
the
underground
mine
and
go
for
a
huge
open
pit
we
couldn
t
do
the
open
pit
we
thought
the
open
pit
be
highly
risky
as
it
turn
out
i
think
you
ll
find
that
for
that
open
pit
to
make
money
it
have
to
be
big
and
big
and
big
so
they
be
go
to
be
sinking
money
into
olympic
dam
for
a
long
time
but
now
bhp

found
itself
in
the
frontline
of
the
political

bhp

without

another
part
of
the

bhp

inherit
be
wmc
s
condescend
and
at
time
bellicose
attitude
to
the
aboriginal

of
the

bhp

uncle
kevin
buzzacott
an
elder
of
the

say
since
the
late
s
early
s
with
the
development
of
roxby
down
and
the
olympic
dam
it
s
sorta
turn
my
life
upside
down
they
make
it
a
nightmare
because
of
the
destruction
that
these
fella
do
on
us
and
on
our
country
desecrate
and
destroy
the
sacred
site
put
their
pipeline
in
and
their
pump
station
and
take
very
special
sacred
water
from
the
lake
eyre
basin
i
think
they
take
about
million
litre
a
day
to
roxby
they
ve
be
do
that
now
for
over
year
and
we
be
sorta
monitoring
our
country
the
best
way
we
can
and
that
s
mainly
from
the
highway
we
haven
t
be
able
to
go
in
off
the
road
to
check
certain
spring
and
waterholes
and
soak
but
the
one
we
have
checked
we
could
see
where
some
have
be
destroyed
and
we
could
see
where
the
water
level
s
go
right
down
we
use
to
use
the
water
but
we
only
take
what
we
need
and
we
wash
and
bath
and
stuff
in
it
as
well
we
ve
never
expect
not
in

that
that
amount
of

that
wmc

these

the

if

him
he
be
a

different
a
modern
style
of

he
go
to

and
do
a
great
job
for

there
in
the

host
a
major
ferro

in

for
which
it
produce
a
ferro

manual
in

nothing
like
that
have
ever
exist
we
realise
stuff
be
happen
there
and
not
just
in
shanghai
he
say
i
go
to
city
you
d
never
heard
of
get
to
them
be
almost
impossible
you
start
to
realise
this
be
much
more
than
just
some
ephemeral
boom
by
the
end
of
bhp
billiton
have
open
the
company
s
big
network
office
in
shanghai

clinton
dines
move
down
from

to
run
it
we
didn
t
shut
the
beijing
office
but
shanghai
be
the
heart
of
china
mike
salamon
say
it
be
one
of
the
best
strategic
move
we
make
because
by
centralise
everything
we
start
to
realise
this
be
massive
and
we
saw
that
long
before
everybody
else
we
have
source
data
which
government
didn
t
have
nobody
have
consequently
we
could
think
about
a
business
model
which
be
more
analogous
to
the
s
and
s
when
the
world
need
raw
material
to
rebuild
europe
and
japan
from
somewhere
in
the
s
all
the
way
through
to
that
change
all
of
us
become
fat
and
happy
that
be
how
it
be
for
year
until
china
get
into
its
creation
we
be
already
approve
project
while
other
people
be
still
in
the
old
mentality
but
it
wasn
t
easy
in
strategy
meeting
marius
kloppers
maintain
that
bhpb
s
resource
in
the
ground
be
now
a
hell
of
a
lot
more
valuable
than
they
have
be
ten
year
earlier
kloppers
recall
lead
a
session
on
the
subject
at
the
danesfield
conference
in
june
because
we
have
restructure
our
operation
on
the
back
of
the
merger
it
give
us
the
opportunity
to
do
a
more
holistic
assessment
of
what
be
come
in
term
of
demand
in
china
he
say
part
of
how
we
set
ourselves
up
be
to
look
at
what
we
anticipate
as
demand
picture
in
china
across
the
range
of
product
china
have
already
become
the
world
s
large
copper
consumer
and
account
for
roughly
a
third
of
the

in

billiton
s

to
china
be
pegged
at

but
they
rise
to
us
billion
in
and
in
the
first
half
of
the
financial
year
leap
to

almost
as
much
as
in
the

bet
that

survive
the

kloppers
and
his
marketeers
kept
their
nerve
and
press
for
more
investment
the
chief
concern
be
still
whether
a

of

capacity
would
make
it
difficult
to
meet

nobody

there

no

all
the

have
be
cut
brad
mill
say
one
of
the
big
strategic
argument
inside

be
what
be
go
to
happen
with
the
future
of

metal
would
they
really
ever
get
back
to
some
long
term
normative
number
in
fact
would
they
start
go
to
a
real

appreciation
it
be
a
huge
battle
inside
bhp
the
board
back
the
strategist
confidence
and
agree
to
invest
us
billion
over
the
next
five
year
to
expand
production
of
its
copper
nickel
and
alumina
in
the
long
haul
we
believe
that
china
be
a
strong
and
robust
story
chris

the

we
fully
expect

on
the
way
investment
include
us

for
a
new

again
us

meant
that

have
account
for

total
sale
and
more
than

growth
don
argus
told
investor
at
the
annual
general
meeting
in
sydney
on
october
we
expect
china
s
economy
to
ease
modestly
from
current
near
double
digit
growth
rate
yet
remain
a
large
and
sustainable
consumer
of
raw
material
and
resource
in
come
year
china
have
rapidly
become
the
leitmotif
of
chip
goodyear
s
reign
as
chief
executive
and
would
remain
so
we
need
to
recognise
there
may
be
something
different
happen
today
than
there
be
ten
year
ago
he
say
in
march
and
that
be
that
billion
people
in
china
and
a
billion
people
in
india
may
be
say
hey
this
be
our
century
this
be
our
chance
for
a
television
set
a
refrigerator
an
air
conditioner
or
ultimately
an
automobile
and
when
that
population
say
that
this
be
something
they
want
to
strive
for
its
consumption
of
raw
material
will
be
quite
significant
just
as
it
be
in
the
world
that
we
see
today
as
a
developed
economy
and
when
that
happens
there
s
a
great
draw
on
the
thing
that
we
produce
it
will
have
its
cycle
just
like
every
other
economy
we
re
involve
in
so
china
be
important
to
what
we
do
but
we
don
t
build
it
on
the
basis
that
it
s
go
to
grow
to
the

go

yes
we
do
in

chip
goodyear
say
we
don
t
see
much
reason
that
china
would
be
below
eight
per
cent
gdp
growth
certainly
for
the
next
number
of
year
the
chief
concern
be
that
a
lack
of
mine
capacity
would
make
it
difficult
to
meet
demand
you
realise
this
be
an
entire
change
of
a
massive
society
mike
salamon
say
the
standard
which
the
chinese
aspire
to
be
yours
and
mine
they
re
not
some
second
class
standard
they
want
nice
apartment
decent
airport
car
then
university
and
they
want
a
clean
environment
you
look
at
modern
chinese
building
they
be
the
most
modern
the
most
environmentally
friendly
there
s
a
lot
of
baggage
there
but
they
want
to
change
it
then
you
work
out
what
do
this
mean
in
term
of
material
and
energy
if
you
add
north
america
to
europe
it
s
much
small
than
china
and
then
you
ve
get
india
wait
in
the
wing
visionary
like
andrew
twiggy
forrest
saw
it
and
we
saw
it
and
we
have
this
incredible
platform
that
we
d
create
for
a
different
world
but
it
be
the
strong
platform
ever
in
term
of
its
asset
base
and
its
global
reach
it
be
now
apparent
that
china
and
india
chindia
to
the
economist
have
trigger
a
supercycle
for
commodity
that
would
last
for
decade
most
of
the
economic
activity
in
india
however
have
be
in
call
centre
computer
software
and
the
it
industry
none
of
which
require
huge
infrastructure
but
in
china
airport
railroad
power
station
and
whole
new

all
big

project
be
be
built
on
a
massive
scale
in
order
to
feed
the
voracious
demand
of
the
supercycle
chip
goodyear
have
to
swallow
his
reservation
about
russia
and
compete
for
its
largely
untapped
resource
of
copper
nickel
coal
and
bauxite
he
take
the
first
step
in
june
by
set
up
a
joint
venture
with
two
of
russia
s
oligarch
mikhail
prokhorov
and
vladimir
potanin
controller
of

his
caution
of

he

goodyear
say
during
a

to

this
alliance
with

a

an

for

of
siberia
president
vladimir
putin
demand
that
russia
retain
control
over
core
natural
resource
asset
so
the
bhp
billiton
venture
be
split
but
norilsk
would
own
one
extra
share
after
a
meeting
with
putin
goodyear
declare
that
rosatom
russia
s
atomic
energy
agency
would
be
a
potential
customer
for
its

goodyear

to

it

to
go

once

so
on
if
you
say
oh
i
m
sorry
no
more
then
you
have
a
problem
no
chinese
leader
in
the
post
deng
era
would
volunteer
for
that
problem
on
the
contrary
the
communist
party

show
themselves
acutely
aware
that
continued
economic
growth

living

be
central
to
their
maintain

a

be
the

so
abundant
in

so

indeed
the

a
new

within
the

this
culminate
in
a
special

indeed
it
provide

with
a

in

with
the
american

a

rudd
in
the

at

then
rudd

comprehensively
at

while

it
seem
it
be
rudd
who
represent
the

however

it
some
unexpected
constraint
his
conservative

begin
a
whisper
campaign
that
rudd
be
the
manchurian
candidate
suggest
that
he
be
too
familiar
with
the
chinese
for

good
this
cause
him
to
cancel
a
plan
trip
to

prior
to
the

and
to
operate
circumspectly
in
his

by
the
time

in

chip
goodyear
be
in
his
last
month
as
chief

the
timing
be
unexpected
but
goodyear
still
only
have
always
make
it
clear
that
he
do
not
intend
to
stay

he
have
preside
over
an
incomparable

almost
the

indeed
at
the
time
he
announce
his

the

he

this
be
well

but
the
sunday
after
take
the

i
do
tell
don
argus
that
it
s
a
five
year
commitment
and
that
s
essentially
what
it
be
i
m
a
big
believer
in

it
s
good
for

and
it

good
for

you
have
a

move
on
although
headhunter
scour
the
global
resource
industry
for
a
replacement
it
be
generally
thought
that
the
two
outstanding
candidate
to
step
into
goodyear
s
shoe
be
marius
kloppers
a
note
archer
in

both
of
whom
have
be
elevate
to
the

in
january
and
give
new

role
the
smart
money
be
always
on
kloppers
at
the
time
of
the
merger
with

he
be

go
on
to
develop
a
formidable
reputation
in
all
aspect
of
the
business
from
merger
and
acquisition
to
copper
iron
ore
and

he
be
now
president

chris
lynch
with
his
root
in
broken
hill
take
over
as
president
of

steel
material
follow
the
retirement
of
bob
kirkby
and
when
mike
salamon
also
retire
he
found
himself
in
charge
of
the
china
office
as
well
at
he
be
seven
year
old
than
kloppers
the
rivalry
be
intense
but
accord
to
insider
the
two
candidate
kept
up
appearance
throughout
the
struggle
at
the
end
of

don
argus
announce
in
a
press
release
that
the
contest
have
be
won
by
dr
kloppers
an
achievement
driven
individual
who
would
become
chief
executive
on
october
although
chip
goodyear
would
officially
step
down
the
day
before
he
would
remain
with
the
company
until
the
end
of
the
year
to
work
on
several
project
chris
lynch
promptly
resign
marius
be
an
extremely
talented
guy
and
be
clearly
the
best
qualify
person
to
take
over
lord
renwick
say
he
be
very
relentless
and
go
get
and
it
take
a
while
for
the
australian
director
to
warm
to
him
but
in
the
end
they
do
he
s
more
of
a
deal
guy
than

western

be
really
do
primarily
by

and
don
rather
than
chip
chip
be
more
cautious
he
s
not
an
instinctive
deal
guy
don
argus
dismiss
suggestion
that
kloppers
style
be
similar
to
that
of
his
billiton
mentor
gilbertson
marius
be
his
own
man
he
insist
his
vast
experience
in
the
resource
sector
and
his
demonstrate
strategic
capability
provide
the
skill
we
need
in
the
next
leader
of
our
great
company
gilbertson
described
kloppers
appointment
as
an
inspire
choice
he
be
a
man
of
formidable
intellect
he
say
he
be
a
very
good
decision
maker
he
can
be
tough
and
ruthless
when
he
need
to
be
and
he
can
be
absolutely
charm
which
he
be
most
of
the
time
when
goodyear
present
his
last
set
of
bhpb
result
in
august
he
unveiled
a
per

jump
in

for

have
benefit
from
high
commodity
price
especially
in
nickel
copper
iron
ore
and
aluminium
goodyear
say
the
absolutely
outstanding
result
also
stem
from
great
production
from
the
company
s
mine
smelter
and
oilfield
china
now
account
for
no
less
than
per

of

we
believe
the
industrialisation
and
urbanisation
that
have
driven
china
s
growth
will
continue
for
several
decade
as
billion
of
people
strive
for
a
well
quality
of
life
he
say
this
growth
be
resource
intensive
and
it
represent
a
steep
change
in
resource
demand
turn
to
his
favourite
metaphor

this
be

say
a

that

not

for

not

more
pertinently
perhaps
steeply

not
the

of

its

in
the

after
a

have
have
enough
kloppers
be

to
reassure
his
fast
grow
consumer
in
november
he
visit
chinese
steel
mill
to
tell
them
the

more

a
more
predictable

they
will
get

get
more
of
that

be
a
very
valuable

he

the

kept
their

word
soon

that
marius

himself
storm
the

restore
rio

and
he
have
no

that
if
anyone
could
pull
it
off
he
be

i

probably
integrate

he
say
what
i
see
before

however

he

we
re

much
as
an

view
china

very
geologically
endow
we
sell
about

we
look
at
the

first
in

if
i
look
at
coke
coal
for
example
that
would
be
driven
primarily
by

we

we

contend

still

the
result
be

no

an

proposal

he
say
would
require

at
the

two
day
later
tom
albanese
present
marius
kloppers
with
an
unwelcome
present
on

in

he
announce
that
rio

would
pursue

with

around

and
in
response
to
kloppers
jibe
that
he
have
miss
the
boat
in
china
albanese
state
that

would
even
increase
its

there
one
of
the
most
interested
observer
of
the
drama
be
sir
robert
wilson
rio
s
former
chairman
and
chief
executive
thing
have
move
on
of
course
he
told
the
author
and
you
have
to
say
do
the
advantage
really
still
outweigh
the
disadvantage
of
a
prospective
bhp
rio
merger
be
those
cost
save
synergy
really
that
material
you
shouldn
t
overlook
the
disadvantage
of
scale
and
manageability
we
can
already
see
company
arguably
in
the
oil
and
gas
industry
which
have
become
so
big
they
can
t
really
be
manage
so
i
think
there
s
a
bit
of
a
risk
there
and
what
both
company
would
lose
be
actually
the
incentive
to
improve
because
it
would
be

for

in

the

he

his

it

just
as
the

approve
some

billion
worth

rudd
add
that
national

would
also
be
relevant
when
it

from

to

it

together
the

he
warn
the

there
be
a
long
way
to
go
for
them
to
clear
regulatory
hurdle
include
approval
from
his

more
pertinently
perhaps
the
eu
regulator
would
be
under
immense
pressure
from
european
steel
mill
to
veto
the

it

this
element
